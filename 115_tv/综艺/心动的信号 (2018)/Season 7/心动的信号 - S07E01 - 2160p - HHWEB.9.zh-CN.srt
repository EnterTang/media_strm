1
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:03,508
Damn it.
I waited too long.

2
00:00:03,591 --> 00:00:04,803
<i>Please, come on,
do something!</i>

3
00:00:04,845 --> 00:00:06,142
<i>Come on, do something!
Do something!</i>

4
00:00:06,185 --> 00:00:07,230
Couldn't have saved her.

5
00:00:11,871 --> 00:00:15,385
It's your choice
if you wanna go back on drugs.

6
00:00:18,396 --> 00:00:19,776
You think
I can fix myself?

7
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,497
I just need to know
if you and I can work.

8
00:00:45,075 --> 00:00:47,333
Let me see.

9
00:00:57,788 --> 00:00:59,502
It's okay.

10
00:01:02,053 --> 00:01:04,605
It's gonna get infected.

11
00:02:09,674 --> 00:02:13,271
Hey, you're not gonna...

12
00:02:13,312 --> 00:02:15,278
You are.

13
00:02:26,651 --> 00:02:27,614
Don't--don't--

14
00:02:27,697 --> 00:02:29,077
<i>It's okay.</i>

15
00:02:30,206 --> 00:02:32,381
I love you.

16
00:04:01,705 --> 00:04:04,130
So now what?

17
00:04:06,557 --> 00:04:10,612
<font color=#ffff00>âª House 7x01 âª</font>
<font color=#00ffff>Now What</font>
<font color=#ffff00>Original air date on September 20, 2010</font>

18
00:04:10,779 --> 00:04:18,558
-- Sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> --

19
00:04:42,185 --> 00:04:44,945
Everything's good.

20
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:47,580
We don't have to
talk through it all.

21
00:04:47,664 --> 00:04:50,841
No, I meant it
literally.

22
00:04:50,883 --> 00:04:52,890
Now what?

23
00:04:52,974 --> 00:04:55,776
We could make breakfast.
We could go bowling.

24
00:04:58,912 --> 00:05:00,794
We could stay here.

25
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:05,896
I have to go home
and get dressed

26
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:08,197
and go to work.

27
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,340
So that's it?

28
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:18,985
I'm hoping this is
the beginning of it.

29
00:05:21,995 --> 00:05:24,004
Yeah.

30
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:34,793
Your assistant's new.

31
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:37,050
It's a 50/50 chance
he just...

32
00:05:37,134 --> 00:05:39,350
Can't find
the light switch.

33
00:05:40,981 --> 00:05:42,069
Hello?

34
00:05:42,153 --> 00:05:44,621
Dr. Cuddy?

35
00:05:44,704 --> 00:05:46,084
No, this is
Dr. Cuddy's nanny.

36
00:05:46,167 --> 00:05:48,635
She's, uh, feeling a little
under the weather now,

37
00:05:48,718 --> 00:05:50,139
so she won't be
coming in today.

38
00:05:50,223 --> 00:05:51,603
Oh. I hope
she's all right.

39
00:05:51,686 --> 00:05:53,024
Would you mind
asking her if--

40
00:05:53,109 --> 00:05:54,280
No. Can't do that.

41
00:05:54,364 --> 00:05:55,994
I'm afraid she's locked
in the bathroom.

42
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:58,211
Terrible bug going around.
What's the problem?

43
00:05:58,294 --> 00:05:59,465
Well, I'm sorry
to disturb her,

44
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,429
but it's Dr. Richardson.

45
00:06:01,472 --> 00:06:03,229
He must have
the same stomach flu.

46
00:06:03,312 --> 00:06:04,776
He threw up
in the O.R.,

47
00:06:04,818 --> 00:06:06,993
<i>and I'm not sure
how she'd want me to--</i>

48
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,498
hold on a second.

49
00:06:08,582 --> 00:06:10,171
I've talked to Dr. Cuddy,

50
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:12,179
and she would like you
to do three things:

51
00:06:12,262 --> 00:06:14,645
One--send him home,
two--sterilize the O.R.,

52
00:06:14,687 --> 00:06:16,612
three--use your own brain.

53
00:06:16,695 --> 00:06:19,120
See ya.

54
00:06:22,214 --> 00:06:24,305
It's about puke.

55
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:26,563
That's what's
so important.

56
00:06:26,647 --> 00:06:28,655
Puke.

57
00:06:28,739 --> 00:06:31,916
Well, I guess I don't
have to rush back in.

58
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:37,311
But whatever "now what"
we do decide on...

59
00:06:37,395 --> 00:06:40,113
It comes after
you take a bath.

60
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,922
Here's one.

61
00:06:44,964 --> 00:06:46,302
"25-year-old man

62
00:06:46,343 --> 00:06:48,310
"with numbness
and tingling in his legs

63
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:49,731
and a speech disorder,
three--"

64
00:06:49,814 --> 00:06:51,655
anybody see House?

65
00:06:51,739 --> 00:06:52,826
It's 10:00 A.M.

66
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:54,247
I'd be worried
if he was here.

67
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,628
"25-year-old"--

68
00:06:55,669 --> 00:06:57,008
he was in pretty bad shape
yesterday

69
00:06:57,091 --> 00:06:58,596
after his patient died.

70
00:06:58,679 --> 00:06:59,851
<i>House has lost
patients before.</i>

71
00:06:59,935 --> 00:07:01,316
We all have.

72
00:07:01,358 --> 00:07:03,154
He's a big boy.
You didn't see him.

73
00:07:03,196 --> 00:07:04,786
<i>Best thing
we can do for him now</i>

74
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,333
is find him a new
puzzle to solve.

75
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,926
Thus bringing us back
to my 25-year-old--

76
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:10,222
yet you're
the only person here

77
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,727
without a potential case
in front of you.

78
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:13,902
I haven't found
the right one yet.

79
00:07:13,986 --> 00:07:15,407
Oh. I-I thought
maybe it was because

80
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:16,870
you were asking for
a leave of absence

81
00:07:16,913 --> 00:07:18,962
and wouldn't have time
to see a case through.

82
00:07:19,045 --> 00:07:20,509
I didn't say anything.

83
00:07:20,592 --> 00:07:22,934
He didn't...I saw
an envelope on House's desk

84
00:07:23,018 --> 00:07:24,942
with your name on it,
so naturally, I...

85
00:07:25,026 --> 00:07:26,405
Steamed it open.

86
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:27,952
What's wrong with you?

87
00:07:28,037 --> 00:07:29,835
You steam an envelope
to keep it secret.

88
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:32,803
Which is why I just ripped it.

89
00:07:32,846 --> 00:07:35,145
You gonna tell us
where you're going?

90
00:07:38,867 --> 00:07:42,715
Sure sounds like a no.

91
00:07:44,847 --> 00:07:47,021
There's glass everywhere.

92
00:07:47,063 --> 00:07:50,868
Couldn't you have just put
the mirror down nice and gentle?

93
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,668
I was in a mood.

94
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,826
I'll be right back.

95
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:04,041
Don't get that.

96
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,338
It could be important.

97
00:08:05,422 --> 00:08:07,512
This is important.

98
00:08:09,311 --> 00:08:11,193
Right now,
we are more important

99
00:08:11,276 --> 00:08:13,368
than what's going on
at the hospital.

100
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:16,545
<i>So...I say we turn off
our phones</i>

101
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:20,310
and...Give the morning
to us.

102
00:08:23,822 --> 00:08:25,579
Okay.

103
00:08:25,663 --> 00:08:27,585
I'll go turn it off.

104
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,175
Thank you.

105
00:08:38,542 --> 00:08:40,717
You're distracted.

106
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,725
I'm not.
Yeah, you are.

107
00:08:42,766 --> 00:08:44,773
You turned off your phone
but you're still wondering,

108
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,530
"what could it have been?

109
00:08:46,572 --> 00:08:47,909
"What emergency
will bring down

110
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:49,415
"the entire hospital

111
00:08:49,457 --> 00:08:51,130
if I decided
to take the morning off?"

112
00:08:51,213 --> 00:08:52,969
I'm sorry.

113
00:08:53,053 --> 00:08:56,775
The clinic is facing reduced
funding from the state.

114
00:08:56,859 --> 00:09:00,790
Nurse Jeffrey is filing
his 12th H.R. complaint.

115
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,838
Richardson
is threatening to quit

116
00:09:02,923 --> 00:09:05,180
because he's basically been
a prisoner at the hospital

117
00:09:05,264 --> 00:09:07,105
for almost a week.

118
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:09,405
Richardson?
The Neurosurgeon.

119
00:09:09,488 --> 00:09:10,742
He's the only one
I have right now,

120
00:09:10,827 --> 00:09:12,666
which means he has to stay
on the premises

121
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,548
at all times,
or else the hospital

122
00:09:14,631 --> 00:09:16,471
technically isn't
a level one Trauma Center.

123
00:09:16,513 --> 00:09:18,186
Which means?

124
00:09:18,228 --> 00:09:20,235
I'd have to shut down
the E.R.,

125
00:09:20,319 --> 00:09:22,326
transfer all of the patients
out of the ICU...

126
00:09:22,368 --> 00:09:24,542
Okay, stop.
Turn around.

127
00:09:24,584 --> 00:09:26,383
Why?
'Cause you need to relax.

128
00:09:29,896 --> 00:09:32,822
Where are we going?

129
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:36,126
I am going to make you
a magical bath

130
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,049
with a lot of bubbles

131
00:09:38,092 --> 00:09:41,479
and eastern spices

132
00:09:41,562 --> 00:09:43,654
and blue diamonds,
green clovers...

133
00:09:43,737 --> 00:09:45,451
Transformative powers.

134
00:09:45,536 --> 00:09:51,139
But I must have solitude
to focus my creative energies.

135
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,532
Hello?

136
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,037
Interesting factoid.

137
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:10,334
Did you know
that if we don't have

138
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,089
a Neurosurgeon
on the premises,

139
00:10:12,174 --> 00:10:13,721
all the puppies in the world

140
00:10:13,805 --> 00:10:15,895
will choke to death
on all the babies?

141
00:10:15,938 --> 00:10:17,107
Yeah.

142
00:10:17,192 --> 00:10:19,450
You got a note
from Thirteen.

143
00:10:19,534 --> 00:10:22,670
So how come we don't have,
like, five Neurosurgeons?

144
00:10:22,753 --> 00:10:26,224
<i>Well, we had three,
but Kapur retired,</i>

145
00:10:26,267 --> 00:10:28,233
and then Nichols just took off
for his daughter's wedding.

146
00:10:28,275 --> 00:10:29,653
I've got good news.

147
00:10:29,737 --> 00:10:33,542
For the next 16 hours,
you are the new Neurosurgeon.

148
00:10:35,006 --> 00:10:36,805
I'm not a Neurosurgeon.

149
00:10:36,888 --> 00:10:38,185
Which would matter

150
00:10:38,268 --> 00:10:40,066
if you actually had to do
some neurosurgery.

151
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,199
<i>House, it's a hospital...
The odds of having to do</i>

152
00:10:42,282 --> 00:10:43,830
neurosurgery are higher
than in most places.

153
00:10:43,872 --> 00:10:46,925
If an EMT calls in
with a brain or spinal trauma,

154
00:10:47,008 --> 00:10:49,057
just divert them
at the nearest hospital.

155
00:10:49,141 --> 00:10:50,688
<i>All you gotta do</i>

156
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,696
is stand around
and keep the E.R. open.

157
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,786
It's an administrative problem,
not a medical one.

158
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,710
House, where
the hell are you?

159
00:10:56,794 --> 00:10:59,135
Great. Glad you're on it.

160
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,903
All systems go!

161
00:11:09,591 --> 00:11:11,932
Why are you going to Rome?

162
00:11:11,974 --> 00:11:14,399
I found the flight
information in your locker.

163
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:15,821
<i>I love how everyone</i>

164
00:11:15,904 --> 00:11:17,619
thinks it's so quaint
and childlike of me

165
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,292
to expect a modicum
of privacy around here.

166
00:11:19,335 --> 00:11:21,760
Your flight's tomorrow.

167
00:11:21,801 --> 00:11:23,432
What's so urgent in Rome?

168
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,896
I hear they want
to tear down the Coliseum

169
00:11:24,979 --> 00:11:26,526
to build a karaoke bar.

170
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,868
The Buona Speranza
Medical Center in Rome

171
00:11:28,952 --> 00:11:30,833
is doing
a Huntington's trial.

172
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,339
Seriously, I live to sing.

173
00:11:32,422 --> 00:11:34,514
I know that they've been doing
fetal neural transplantation.

174
00:11:34,597 --> 00:11:35,977
I also know
that their subjects

175
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:38,235
have increased risk
of intracranial hemorrhage.

176
00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:40,076
This isn't the time
to join a trial.

177
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,331
This research
is in its infancy.

178
00:11:41,373 --> 00:11:43,295
So's your condition.

179
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:45,220
You read my note.

180
00:11:45,262 --> 00:11:47,101
You go through my locker.

181
00:11:47,184 --> 00:11:48,941
And then you decide
you want to round it off

182
00:11:49,026 --> 00:11:50,822
by lecturing me
on my life choices?

183
00:11:50,906 --> 00:11:53,081
I'm worried about you.

184
00:11:53,123 --> 00:11:55,423
Oh. Well, that makes it
all right then.

185
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:11,523
So what, exactly,

186
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:12,610
<i>is this?</i>

187
00:12:12,652 --> 00:12:14,158
It can still be open
and casual

188
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:16,206
and fun if you want.

189
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,755
Open?

190
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,849
You think I want to see
other people?

191
00:12:20,932 --> 00:12:24,528
Well, last night
was emotional for you.

192
00:12:24,612 --> 00:12:27,540
We both lost that patient.
We watched people die.

193
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:30,216
I came back here
and I went for the Vicodin,

194
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,226
and you...Dumped your fiancÃ©
and you came here.

195
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,443
Which I don't regret.

196
00:12:35,526 --> 00:12:37,576
I'm not saying you do.

197
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:40,084
I'm just saying
it was an impulsive move.

198
00:12:41,215 --> 00:12:42,427
Don't do this.

199
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,020
Why do you have to
analyze things to death?

200
00:12:45,103 --> 00:12:47,947
Why can't you just...
Let it be nice?

201
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:52,630
You're right.

202
00:12:52,713 --> 00:12:55,180
That was very
anti-secret bath.

203
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,622
House.

204
00:13:01,706 --> 00:13:03,963
Yeah.

205
00:13:04,006 --> 00:13:06,263
The secret bath is...

206
00:13:06,347 --> 00:13:09,483
Burning my lady parts.

207
00:13:09,525 --> 00:13:14,668
How do you think
my anus feels?

208
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,554
Burning means it's working.

209
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,268
Can we get out now?

210
00:13:19,352 --> 00:13:21,109
I was so waiting
for you to say that.

211
00:13:22,782 --> 00:13:26,754
Could I speak to
Dr. Jankowski?

212
00:13:26,837 --> 00:13:30,476
No. I don't need
to disturb him in Bermuda.

213
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,358
Everything okay?

214
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,491
Dr. Cuddy's phone keeps going
directly to voicemail,

215
00:13:34,574 --> 00:13:36,205
and I need to get
a Neurosurgeon

216
00:13:36,247 --> 00:13:37,919
to replace Dr. Richardson
for the day

217
00:13:38,004 --> 00:13:39,383
or else she's screwed.

218
00:13:39,425 --> 00:13:42,060
I'm a Neurosurgeon.

219
00:13:42,102 --> 00:13:44,192
No. You're not.

220
00:13:44,276 --> 00:13:46,074
I've cut into people's
heads more often--

221
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,788
you did a residency
in neurosurgery

222
00:13:47,873 --> 00:13:49,127
<i>at the University
of Melbourne,</i>

223
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,632
<i>but you were never
board-certified.</i>

224
00:13:50,716 --> 00:13:52,682
You've worked here two days.
How--

225
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:54,773
Dr. Cuddy's first assignment
was for me to get to know

226
00:13:54,814 --> 00:13:56,988
everything about
Dr. House's team...

227
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:59,874
And not to believe anything
any of them told me.

228
00:13:59,957 --> 00:14:02,843
I'm...Not
a Neurosurgeon?

229
00:14:05,395 --> 00:14:07,319
And...Voila!

230
00:14:07,361 --> 00:14:08,865
The first course,

231
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:12,211
I flaked some tender
young ears of corn

232
00:14:12,253 --> 00:14:15,890
on the side of assorted
exotic breakfast meats

233
00:14:15,932 --> 00:14:18,233
in a Chile sauce reduction.

234
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,406
And the...
Second course?

235
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:23,461
A single grape.
To cleanse the palate.

236
00:14:23,544 --> 00:14:27,391
Which is kind of a waste,
'cause there is no third course.

237
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:30,611
I'm glad we stayed in.

238
00:14:30,653 --> 00:14:32,618
This is actually...
Pretty good.

239
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:35,212
I can always tell
when you lie.

240
00:14:37,637 --> 00:14:39,184
<i>I mean always.</i>

241
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:42,948
I slept with
my freshman roommate.

242
00:14:42,989 --> 00:14:44,369
A lie.
A truth.

243
00:14:44,452 --> 00:14:46,293
You have a tell.
What is it?

244
00:14:46,335 --> 00:14:48,341
First admit
that you were lying.

245
00:14:48,383 --> 00:14:50,892
Fine. I was lying.

246
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:53,317
My sexual history
is boring and predictable.

247
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,409
What is my tell?
Are you kidding?

248
00:14:55,493 --> 00:14:57,124
If I tell you your tell,
you'll get rid of it,

249
00:14:57,207 --> 00:14:58,421
then I won't be able
to tell.

250
00:14:58,504 --> 00:15:00,218
Well, then you have to
tell me something

251
00:15:00,302 --> 00:15:01,681
I don't already know
about you.

252
00:15:01,723 --> 00:15:03,899
Even though, technically,
you didn't tell me something

253
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,403
that I didn't already
know about you.

254
00:15:05,486 --> 00:15:08,165
Quit being so damn logical
and just tell me.

255
00:15:10,003 --> 00:15:12,555
I used to have
an intimate relationship

256
00:15:12,597 --> 00:15:14,436
with a photograph of you.

257
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:18,033
Well, actually,
a sock and a photograph.

258
00:15:18,116 --> 00:15:19,330
I know.

259
00:15:19,413 --> 00:15:21,462
I was lying.

260
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,720
The photo you took of me
as sleeping beauty on Halloween.

261
00:15:23,804 --> 00:15:25,643
Why else would you
take that picture?

262
00:15:28,112 --> 00:15:29,741
I have to pee.

263
00:15:32,167 --> 00:15:33,881
Ha! You can tell.

264
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,387
'Cause actually,
I have to poo.

265
00:15:42,706 --> 00:15:44,170
What?

266
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:47,556
Cuddy's assistant decided
to use his own brain.

267
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,270
<i>Who put that idiot idea
into his head?</i>

268
00:15:49,354 --> 00:15:51,571
Perhaps you could
follow the same advice.

269
00:15:51,613 --> 00:15:54,791
He notified DPH that there's
no Neurosurgeon on the premises.

270
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:58,095
Said he legally had to,
which he legally had to.

271
00:15:58,178 --> 00:16:00,269
Sounds like you got
the situation under control.

272
00:16:00,354 --> 00:16:01,273
<i>No. I don't.</i>

273
00:16:01,315 --> 00:16:02,653
You know I don't.

274
00:16:02,736 --> 00:16:05,288
When DPH shows up,
they're gonna shut down our E.R.

275
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,294
<i>This can't be fixed.
It is what it is, House.</i>

276
00:16:07,378 --> 00:16:08,800
Great. I've got
every faith

277
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,807
in your ability
to solve the problem.

278
00:16:16,704 --> 00:16:18,501
I have called
every Neurosurgeon

279
00:16:18,585 --> 00:16:20,761
within a 45-mile radius--
nothing.

280
00:16:20,844 --> 00:16:22,140
I think House
is just testing us.

281
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:23,352
He's always
testing us.

282
00:16:23,436 --> 00:16:24,523
Test or not,
it's a problem.

283
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,030
It's not our problem.

284
00:16:26,113 --> 00:16:27,451
Why the hell is it House's
problem?

285
00:16:27,535 --> 00:16:28,831
Where the hell is Cuddy?

286
00:16:28,873 --> 00:16:30,545
<i>We either report this,</i>

287
00:16:30,587 --> 00:16:32,470
and half the hospital
gets shut down,

288
00:16:32,553 --> 00:16:34,266
or we cover it up
and run the risk

289
00:16:34,351 --> 00:16:35,816
that the entire hospital
gets shut down.

290
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:37,739
Or we get Richardson.

291
00:16:37,781 --> 00:16:39,118
He's sick.

292
00:16:39,202 --> 00:16:41,252
And we're doctors.
We get people better.

293
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:44,263
Fing fong fooey?

294
00:16:46,729 --> 00:16:47,985
Ohh...

295
00:16:50,535 --> 00:16:52,040
Can I open them yet?

296
00:16:52,124 --> 00:16:54,048
<i>Just a second.</i>

297
00:16:54,131 --> 00:16:56,725
<i>Okay.
Hold out your hand.</i>

298
00:17:01,157 --> 00:17:02,537
Oh...

299
00:17:04,043 --> 00:17:06,008
I always wanted
to open a bottle of champagne

300
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:07,805
with one of these things.

301
00:17:07,847 --> 00:17:10,440
<i>You might wanna
stand behind me for this.</i>

302
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,787
Okay...

303
00:17:16,212 --> 00:17:17,717
Oh!

304
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:19,641
Yeah!

305
00:17:19,724 --> 00:17:22,568
Mm, I think I might have...

306
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,240
Got that slightly wrong.

307
00:17:25,914 --> 00:17:28,213
Well, good thing
I got a case.

308
00:17:30,178 --> 00:17:32,604
<i>House, open up.</i>

309
00:17:32,687 --> 00:17:34,987
<i>We need to talk.</i>

310
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,242
Just let him in.

311
00:17:36,284 --> 00:17:37,623
No.

312
00:17:37,664 --> 00:17:39,086
<i>House!</i>

313
00:17:39,128 --> 00:17:41,470
If we just ignore him,
he'll go away.

314
00:17:43,142 --> 00:17:44,731
<i>House!</i>

315
00:17:48,118 --> 00:17:52,132
I think he finally left.

316
00:17:52,217 --> 00:17:54,141
But just in case he hasn't,

317
00:17:54,225 --> 00:17:57,151
what can we do that does not
involve talking?

318
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:06,644
You turned on my ringer!

319
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:08,233
<i>I know you're in there.</i>

320
00:18:08,317 --> 00:18:10,157
<i>I can hear your
cell phone ringing.</i>

321
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:11,369
Just let him in.

322
00:18:11,453 --> 00:18:13,377
No!

323
00:18:13,461 --> 00:18:14,883
He's like a stray...

324
00:18:14,924 --> 00:18:18,187
He'll eat everything,
shed all over the place,

325
00:18:18,228 --> 00:18:20,570
and crap on the floor.

326
00:18:21,824 --> 00:18:23,330
Hi.
This is Gregory House.

327
00:18:23,413 --> 00:18:24,709
I can't take your call
at the moment.

328
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:26,090
Please leave a message.

329
00:18:26,131 --> 00:18:29,101
If this is Wilson,
I'm fine, not suicidal,

330
00:18:29,185 --> 00:18:30,564
not on drugs,

331
00:18:30,606 --> 00:18:33,116
coping very well with the loss
of my last patient.

332
00:18:33,157 --> 00:18:35,541
So feel free to go about
your day without worry.

333
00:18:35,624 --> 00:18:37,088
Beep!

334
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,678
<i>House...</i>

335
00:18:38,761 --> 00:18:41,311
<i>You can't just
not show up to work.</i>

336
00:18:41,396 --> 00:18:43,277
<i>What's Cuddy gonna say?</i>

337
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:45,618
If this is still Wilson...

338
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,209
She gave me the day off.

339
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,588
And tomorrow.

340
00:18:48,672 --> 00:18:50,428
Okay, maybe not tomorrow.

341
00:18:50,511 --> 00:18:52,143
But today.
I'm fine.

342
00:18:52,185 --> 00:18:53,899
Now, go away.

343
00:18:56,742 --> 00:19:00,213
Beep!

344
00:19:00,296 --> 00:19:03,016
<i>If you're not in tomorrow,
i'll be back.</i>

345
00:19:13,762 --> 00:19:15,728
Look, you're the only
Neurosurgeon we've got.

346
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:18,446
You have to suck it up
and go back to the hospital.

347
00:19:18,488 --> 00:19:21,291
We're not asking you
to operate, just to be there.

348
00:19:21,332 --> 00:19:23,506
Unless you can transport
this t-toilet with me,

349
00:19:23,591 --> 00:19:25,513
I'm not leaving
the room.

350
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,102
I'll get a bucket.

351
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:28,482
You're missing
the point.

352
00:19:28,524 --> 00:19:31,452
I ate bad Sushi.
I'm sick. Go away.

353
00:19:31,494 --> 00:19:33,249
We can give you promethazine
for the nausea.

354
00:19:33,334 --> 00:19:34,253
Already took it.

355
00:19:34,337 --> 00:19:37,306
<i>And trimethobenzamide.</i>

356
00:19:37,349 --> 00:19:38,770
Maybe this isn't
food poisoning.

357
00:19:38,854 --> 00:19:40,192
Whatever it is,

358
00:19:40,276 --> 00:19:42,325
it must have damaged
the lining of his stomach.

359
00:19:42,367 --> 00:19:44,248
<i>Till that heals,
nothing's gonna work.</i>

360
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,381
<i>So we need to treat
both that and the nausea.</i>

361
00:19:46,422 --> 00:19:48,263
And whatever's
wrong with him.

362
00:19:48,347 --> 00:19:51,273
We give him ondansetron
and prostaglandins.

363
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,403
And whatever's wrong
with him.

364
00:19:52,487 --> 00:19:53,908
Neither of those will treat

365
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:55,540
any possible
underlying condition.

366
00:19:55,581 --> 00:19:56,836
Who cares?
He's not our patient.

367
00:19:56,919 --> 00:19:58,257
The hospital is.

368
00:19:58,299 --> 00:19:59,972
I can...Hear you.

369
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:08,920
You're pretty miserable,
aren't you?

370
00:20:08,962 --> 00:20:12,643
Would you be willing
to take a...Fairly risky drug

371
00:20:12,727 --> 00:20:15,069
if it would make it
all go away?

372
00:20:19,376 --> 00:20:21,675
Ah!

373
00:20:29,078 --> 00:20:31,586
Why didn't you
let him in?

374
00:20:34,389 --> 00:20:35,936
You were
thinking about Wilson

375
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:38,026
while we were having sex?

376
00:20:38,068 --> 00:20:40,578
That's so cool!
So was I.

377
00:20:40,662 --> 00:20:44,091
You were hiding me
from him.

378
00:20:44,133 --> 00:20:46,264
Why?

379
00:20:46,306 --> 00:20:48,397
I was not hiding you.

380
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,659
I was protecting
your privacy.

381
00:20:51,743 --> 00:20:54,377
Wasn't sure if you were
ready to go public

382
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:57,473
with the whole...
"Us" thing yet.

383
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,818
Why would I be
doing all this

384
00:21:00,901 --> 00:21:03,117
if I wanted it to be
private?

385
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:05,167
Ohh...

386
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:15,621
Oh. I never even asked.

387
00:21:18,381 --> 00:21:20,557
Maybe you're not ready yet.

388
00:21:26,242 --> 00:21:28,585
Have you read the list
of side effects on those drugs?

389
00:21:28,627 --> 00:21:29,964
We could crash his BP.

390
00:21:30,048 --> 00:21:31,429
I haven't heard a thump,

391
00:21:31,471 --> 00:21:33,353
so I assume he's still
quietly puking.

392
00:21:33,436 --> 00:21:35,108
We could be
making him worse.

393
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:36,405
Bigger picture--

394
00:21:36,447 --> 00:21:38,119
we're making
the hospital better.

395
00:21:38,203 --> 00:21:40,419
We can test for whatever
you want to test him for

396
00:21:40,461 --> 00:21:42,761
once he's stable enough
to get back to the hospital.

397
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:45,730
Now, stop being a girl
and move.

398
00:21:45,814 --> 00:21:48,323
So you gonna ask me
about this Huntington's trial,

399
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,372
and by ask, I mean
give me your opinion?

400
00:21:50,455 --> 00:21:52,170
No.

401
00:21:52,213 --> 00:21:54,512
There is one thing,
though.

402
00:21:56,185 --> 00:21:58,235
Will you have sex
with me?

403
00:22:00,074 --> 00:22:01,329
What?

404
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,336
Well, this trial means
you're leaving right away.

405
00:22:03,377 --> 00:22:04,758
I was playing
a long game.

406
00:22:04,842 --> 00:22:07,309
Deadlines
have been moved up.

407
00:22:11,198 --> 00:22:12,913
Wow.

408
00:22:12,996 --> 00:22:14,543
That stuff is good.

409
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:16,006
Think you can make it
back to the hospital?

410
00:22:16,091 --> 00:22:17,136
Uh-huh.

411
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,892
That lamp is shiny.

412
00:22:20,565 --> 00:22:23,116
I mean,
the way it shines is...

413
00:22:24,203 --> 00:22:25,500
Shiny.

414
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:26,963
I take it this is one
of the side effects

415
00:22:27,004 --> 00:22:28,468
of the drugs.

416
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,142
Who cares?
Let's go.

417
00:22:38,506 --> 00:22:40,512
What are you doing?

418
00:22:40,596 --> 00:22:42,437
You think I'm afraid
to go public?

419
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,941
I'm gonna prove you wrong.

420
00:22:44,025 --> 00:22:45,447
With a tripod?

421
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,374
With a sex tape.
We'll send it to Wilson.

422
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:49,545
It's a win-win.

423
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,218
We get to do it again,

424
00:22:51,259 --> 00:22:53,936
and...He might actually
learn something.

425
00:22:56,236 --> 00:22:58,829
It sounds like someone's
trying to break in.

426
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,760
It's probably nothing.

427
00:23:02,845 --> 00:23:04,725
Stay here.

428
00:23:15,639 --> 00:23:17,020
Hey.

429
00:23:17,103 --> 00:23:18,568
Stuck?

430
00:23:18,651 --> 00:23:20,156
Bummer.

431
00:23:20,239 --> 00:23:22,707
Looks painful.

432
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:26,512
Chamomile
or English breakfast?

433
00:23:26,554 --> 00:23:29,189
Would you stop
being an ass

434
00:23:29,272 --> 00:23:32,033
and pull me out of here?

435
00:23:32,075 --> 00:23:34,207
You didn't get
my message earlier?

436
00:23:34,249 --> 00:23:36,632
Yeah. But as someone
once told me,

437
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,682
everybody lies.

438
00:23:38,723 --> 00:23:39,894
I'm fine.

439
00:23:39,978 --> 00:23:42,445
Just staying home,
chill-laxin'.

440
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:43,866
<i>Your patient died,</i>

441
00:23:43,908 --> 00:23:45,749
you ignore my calls,
and you won't open the door.

442
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:47,463
I don't think you're fine.

443
00:23:47,547 --> 00:23:50,266
I think you might be
throwing away a drug-free year.

444
00:23:50,308 --> 00:23:52,691
Or...I'm ignoring you
for a different reason.

445
00:23:52,774 --> 00:23:54,531
Sex with my girlfriend.

446
00:23:54,615 --> 00:23:57,835
Hmm.

447
00:23:57,918 --> 00:23:59,466
Will you please just--

448
00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:01,640
please let me in?

449
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,869
Thank you.

450
00:24:18,911 --> 00:24:21,169
And since when did you
start referring to hookers

451
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:22,549
as girlfriends?

452
00:24:22,633 --> 00:24:25,100
She's not a hooker.

453
00:24:25,183 --> 00:24:26,982
What are--wha--

454
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:28,404
really?

455
00:24:28,446 --> 00:24:31,247
Begins with "C",
ends with uddy.

456
00:24:33,966 --> 00:24:35,597
How many Vicodin
have you taken?

457
00:24:35,638 --> 00:24:36,768
<i>I'm serious.</i>

458
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:38,942
Cuddy and I
are now Cuddy and I.

459
00:24:38,984 --> 00:24:40,865
There's an "I"
in Cuddy.

460
00:24:40,948 --> 00:24:42,623
House...It's okay.

461
00:24:42,706 --> 00:24:45,633
Almost all addicts
relapse a few times.

462
00:24:45,716 --> 00:24:47,641
She's in my bedroom.

463
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:51,989
You're hallucinating,
House.

464
00:24:52,031 --> 00:24:55,000
Honey buns!
We got company.

465
00:25:10,096 --> 00:25:12,146
Pupils are normal.
Pulse is normal.

466
00:25:13,317 --> 00:25:14,864
Better than that.

467
00:25:14,947 --> 00:25:17,247
They're both
totally awesome.

468
00:25:17,331 --> 00:25:19,464
I'm not on drugs.

469
00:25:19,506 --> 00:25:22,307
So...Why did you lie
about Cuddy?

470
00:25:22,349 --> 00:25:24,273
To make a point.

471
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:26,448
Probably something to do
with shutting you up.

472
00:25:26,532 --> 00:25:29,333
It's my go-to idea.

473
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:31,508
You do seem okay.

474
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,930
You want me to stick around?

475
00:25:33,013 --> 00:25:34,351
I could do my usual thing

476
00:25:34,393 --> 00:25:36,442
of pretending I like
watching monster truck rallies,

477
00:25:36,526 --> 00:25:37,738
if that would
make you feel better.

478
00:25:37,822 --> 00:25:39,705
No. You go.

479
00:25:41,627 --> 00:25:44,220
House...You could have
died.

480
00:25:44,262 --> 00:25:46,770
You had a patient
who did die in your arms.

481
00:25:46,855 --> 00:25:48,695
You shouldn't be alone.

482
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:51,413
I know.
That's why I called a hooker.

483
00:25:51,455 --> 00:25:53,296
Now, go away.

484
00:25:53,338 --> 00:25:56,306
'Cause...
You'll be extra.

485
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:57,894
Are you really okay?

486
00:25:57,978 --> 00:26:00,404
Are you gonna
break in again?

487
00:26:00,489 --> 00:26:03,164
You checked my pulse.
You checked my pupils.

488
00:26:03,247 --> 00:26:05,799
I'll mail you
the urine sample.

489
00:26:21,105 --> 00:26:23,613
How come I've never
even met you guys?

490
00:26:23,697 --> 00:26:25,746
<i>Y-you're like the greatest...</i>

491
00:26:25,788 --> 00:26:27,168
<i>Guys. You know
fluorescent lights</i>

492
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,259
flicker at the same frequency
as the human brain?

493
00:26:29,301 --> 00:26:31,600
You know the human brain
doesn't flicker?

494
00:26:31,642 --> 00:26:33,524
Doesn't take a brain surgeon
to figure out

495
00:26:33,609 --> 00:26:35,908
that he can't perform
brain surgery.

496
00:26:35,949 --> 00:26:36,953
What's wrong with him?

497
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:39,044
High...Blood sugar.

498
00:26:39,127 --> 00:26:41,135
He'll be fine as soon
as we rehydrate him.

499
00:26:41,177 --> 00:26:42,223
That's a relief.

500
00:26:42,306 --> 00:26:43,435
Thank God.

501
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:44,982
DPH guy will be here
in 20 minutes.

502
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:50,294
What is wrong with him?

503
00:26:50,336 --> 00:26:51,506
High blood sugar.

504
00:26:51,548 --> 00:26:52,678
You just said so.

505
00:26:52,761 --> 00:26:54,725
Chase is running labs.

506
00:26:54,809 --> 00:26:56,483
Right now the top two
contenders are hepatitis

507
00:26:56,525 --> 00:26:58,072
and peptic ulcer disease.

508
00:26:58,156 --> 00:27:02,044
So...Is today really
your last day?

509
00:27:02,086 --> 00:27:04,386
Flying out tomorrow.

510
00:27:04,428 --> 00:27:06,686
How long a leave
are you taking?

511
00:27:06,728 --> 00:27:08,275
Depends.

512
00:27:08,358 --> 00:27:09,571
On the drug trial.
Sounds risky.

513
00:27:09,614 --> 00:27:10,659
Yadda, yadda.

514
00:27:10,742 --> 00:27:11,829
You don't think
I should do it.

515
00:27:11,913 --> 00:27:12,875
Message heard.

516
00:27:12,917 --> 00:27:14,422
No. I approve.

517
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,847
Living fast
and dying young is crap.

518
00:27:16,932 --> 00:27:19,525
If you have a chance
to get better...

519
00:27:19,608 --> 00:27:22,327
I say good for you.

520
00:27:25,086 --> 00:27:27,177
I brought Wilson in here
specifically to go public,

521
00:27:27,261 --> 00:27:29,812
just like you requested.

522
00:27:29,895 --> 00:27:31,233
I pressured you.

523
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:34,872
Wilson coming through
the window pressured you.

524
00:27:34,956 --> 00:27:38,092
If you're forced into this,
it's not gonna work.

525
00:27:42,441 --> 00:27:44,448
Do you have any response
to that?

526
00:27:49,174 --> 00:27:52,017
Game on.

527
00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:53,900
Is he better?
Yep.

528
00:27:53,942 --> 00:27:56,032
You're lying to me
again, aren't you?

529
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:57,412
Yep.
Then we're screwed.

530
00:27:57,454 --> 00:27:58,541
Don't we have
to tell--

531
00:27:58,583 --> 00:28:00,004
oh! Damn.

532
00:28:00,088 --> 00:28:02,597
Dr. Richardson's
prepping for surgery.

533
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:04,855
Yeah. I need to talk
to him.

534
00:28:04,939 --> 00:28:07,115
He's prepping for surgery.
So you said.

535
00:28:07,198 --> 00:28:09,707
I just need to confirm
he is who you say he is

536
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:12,508
and that he's
a licensed Neurosurgeon.

537
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:14,180
Well,
here's his paperwork.

538
00:28:14,265 --> 00:28:15,644
His hospital I.D.'s
right there.

539
00:28:15,686 --> 00:28:17,526
You can...See it's him.

540
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:19,367
Yeah. I should
still talk to him.

541
00:28:19,451 --> 00:28:21,248
They've already scrubbed.
He'd have to be re-sterilized.

542
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:23,381
The patient's anesthesia
would have to be adjusted.

543
00:28:23,465 --> 00:28:26,099
Why did you report
he wasn't here?

544
00:28:28,817 --> 00:28:30,992
I must have...
Misunderstood.

545
00:28:39,564 --> 00:28:41,363
Oh...Why...

546
00:28:41,405 --> 00:28:42,952
Why...

547
00:28:43,035 --> 00:28:44,456
Why is it so...
So hot in there?

548
00:28:44,541 --> 00:28:45,879
Oh!

549
00:28:47,511 --> 00:28:48,932
Ahh.

550
00:28:49,015 --> 00:28:51,901
La-dee-dah.

551
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:55,037
Woodstock, baby.

552
00:28:55,121 --> 00:28:56,459
Is he stoned?

553
00:28:56,542 --> 00:28:58,968
No. We're pretty
sure he's got--

554
00:28:59,051 --> 00:29:00,975
oh, I'm sure you have
an explanation,

555
00:29:01,017 --> 00:29:02,189
but I don't care.

556
00:29:02,272 --> 00:29:04,572
See, you need to have
a doctor on the premises

557
00:29:04,655 --> 00:29:06,663
who can actually do
neurosurgery.

558
00:29:06,705 --> 00:29:09,381
Tell the attending
to divert all ambulances away

559
00:29:09,465 --> 00:29:10,887
and start calling
other hospitals

560
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:14,023
and see who can take
your stabilized ICU patients.

561
00:29:14,065 --> 00:29:15,780
Those departments
are shutting down.

562
00:29:18,874 --> 00:29:20,839
"Design" for five points.
Got it.

563
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,600
"Hear."
Got it.
Both versions.

564
00:29:23,684 --> 00:29:27,112
"Love."

565
00:29:27,195 --> 00:29:28,742
You didn't see love.

566
00:29:28,784 --> 00:29:30,666
Wow. I didn't think
you'd take

567
00:29:30,749 --> 00:29:33,594
my lack of board game skills
so personally.

568
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:37,775
Why didn't you tell me
you loved me?

569
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,407
Didn't a wise woman
once say--

570
00:29:39,449 --> 00:29:41,706
and by once,
I mean two hours ago--

571
00:29:41,789 --> 00:29:43,631
"why do you have to analyze
everything to death?

572
00:29:43,672 --> 00:29:45,386
Why can't this
just be nice?"

573
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,808
I told you I loved you.

574
00:29:46,893 --> 00:29:48,607
You didn't tell me
you loved me back.

575
00:29:48,649 --> 00:29:52,161
You don't think that should
give me cause for concern?

576
00:29:52,204 --> 00:29:53,499
No. 'Cause words
don't matter.

577
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,841
Actions matter.

578
00:29:55,883 --> 00:29:58,267
You're really gonna
take a stand here.

579
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,479
You can't say--
nope.

580
00:29:59,522 --> 00:30:01,319
Why?

581
00:30:01,361 --> 00:30:02,741
Because...

582
00:30:02,825 --> 00:30:05,042
I forgot to grab a "v."

583
00:30:10,854 --> 00:30:12,820
Lobe.

584
00:30:12,903 --> 00:30:14,450
Gets you one point.

585
00:30:16,207 --> 00:30:18,674
One.

586
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:35,778
Labs show he's negative
for everything.

587
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,161
I'm guessing at least
one of them is wrong.

588
00:30:38,245 --> 00:30:39,750
Who cares?
The E.R. and the ICU

589
00:30:39,792 --> 00:30:42,009
are half-empty and the place
is crawling with suits.

590
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:43,263
It's over.

591
00:30:43,305 --> 00:30:44,894
You do know we still have
a sick patient here.

592
00:30:44,978 --> 00:30:46,608
<i>Right?
He's the guy sitting</i>

593
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:49,911
right behind you,
taking off his clothes again.

594
00:30:49,996 --> 00:30:52,087
Uh, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

595
00:30:52,171 --> 00:30:53,341
Uh, why don't you
just sit down

596
00:30:53,425 --> 00:30:55,015
and take it easy?

597
00:30:55,098 --> 00:30:56,687
He should be coming down
by now.

598
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,196
And yet...I'm not.

599
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,037
<i>What if his behavior</i>

600
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:03,587
isn't a side effect
of the ondansetron?

601
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,720
<i>What if it's a symptom?
Thank you.</i>

602
00:31:05,762 --> 00:31:07,894
<i>What causes delirium
and nausea?</i>

603
00:31:07,936 --> 00:31:10,403
<i>He's been stuck here
in the hospital a few days.</i>

604
00:31:10,444 --> 00:31:12,160
Nobody else is sick,
so it can't be environmental.

605
00:31:12,244 --> 00:31:13,791
Not exactly stuck.
I snuck out.

606
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:17,596
Freedom is my birthright.

607
00:31:17,638 --> 00:31:19,896
Where did you go?

608
00:31:19,938 --> 00:31:21,988
<i>The Seafood Festival at the Convention Center.
We're screwed.</i>

609
00:31:22,071 --> 00:31:24,706
Seafood Festival has stuff
from all around the world

610
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:26,295
<i>in combinations
nobody every thought of.</i>

611
00:31:26,377 --> 00:31:27,967
<i>We could be here
all year.</i>

612
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,514
<i>You had shrimp?
Uh-huh.</i>

613
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:30,768
<i>And crab?
Lobster?
Uh-huh.</i>

614
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:32,484
<i>Uh-huh.
And...</i>

615
00:31:32,525 --> 00:31:35,661
I ate whatever
looked good.

616
00:31:35,745 --> 00:31:37,962
Did you eat any roe?

617
00:31:38,004 --> 00:31:40,136
<i>Little tiny eggs?
Nummy!</i>

618
00:31:40,178 --> 00:31:43,607
Toad eggs will cause nausea,
and they can get you high.

619
00:31:43,691 --> 00:31:46,201
<i>If I'm right,
the antidote is fast-acting.</i>

620
00:31:46,284 --> 00:31:48,207
If we can get him to keep
his clothes on long enough,

621
00:31:48,249 --> 00:31:51,719
he can pass
as a functioning Neurosurgeon.

622
00:31:55,023 --> 00:31:57,408
Um...

623
00:31:57,491 --> 00:31:58,453
France.

624
00:31:58,537 --> 00:32:00,251
And not Paris or the Rivera,

625
00:32:00,334 --> 00:32:02,259
but there's this place
in Normandy.

626
00:32:02,301 --> 00:32:04,308
It's on a...
A tidal island.

627
00:32:04,391 --> 00:32:06,523
Everyone who's not staying
in one of the small inns

628
00:32:06,608 --> 00:32:08,531
has to leave
before the tide comes in.

629
00:32:08,615 --> 00:32:13,298
You have this 900-year-old
fortress all to yourself.

630
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,974
It's called...

631
00:32:16,058 --> 00:32:18,735
Mont Saint-Michel?

632
00:32:18,818 --> 00:32:20,825
That's it.
Have you been there?

633
00:32:20,867 --> 00:32:24,129
Nope. But I got a pretty
good idea what it looks like.

634
00:32:24,171 --> 00:32:26,304
H-how did you know?

635
00:32:26,346 --> 00:32:28,185
You used to have a picture
of it as a screensaver.

636
00:32:28,227 --> 00:32:29,817
That was years ago.

637
00:32:29,858 --> 00:32:32,116
I guess
it's a memorable place.

638
00:32:32,199 --> 00:32:34,542
Now, unfortunately, we can't
fly straight to normandy,

639
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:37,344
but the layover in London's
only a couple of hours.

640
00:32:37,386 --> 00:32:38,515
What are you talking
about?

641
00:32:38,557 --> 00:32:40,438
It's all there.

642
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:41,901
All you gotta do
is click confirm,

643
00:32:41,986 --> 00:32:43,073
and we're eating croissant

644
00:32:43,157 --> 00:32:45,414
and being insulted
by stinky people

645
00:32:45,456 --> 00:32:47,172
this time tomorrow.

646
00:32:47,255 --> 00:32:49,764
Don't worry.
I used Wilson's credit card.

647
00:32:49,805 --> 00:32:51,061
I can't.

648
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:53,109
I'm kidding.

649
00:32:53,193 --> 00:32:55,452
I used your credit card.

650
00:32:55,535 --> 00:32:57,583
House...

651
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:59,048
The hospital
does not need your body.

652
00:32:59,132 --> 00:33:00,678
I do.
So does my daughter.

653
00:33:00,762 --> 00:33:02,101
Well,
she can come too.

654
00:33:02,142 --> 00:33:04,901
Or to grandmother's house
she can go.

655
00:33:04,985 --> 00:33:07,996
This is crazy.

656
00:33:10,339 --> 00:33:14,018
So...You break off
your engagement,

657
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,444
but you won't adjust
your schedule.

658
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,796
I can't.

659
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,682
Not...Tomorrow.

660
00:33:24,724 --> 00:33:28,362
But...Two weekends
from now.

661
00:33:28,404 --> 00:33:30,620
If Rachel's gonna
stay with my mom,

662
00:33:30,704 --> 00:33:34,677
I'm gonna need a little
bit of prep time.

663
00:33:34,761 --> 00:33:35,932
Okay.

664
00:33:42,747 --> 00:33:44,002
What if it doesn't work?

665
00:33:44,087 --> 00:33:45,298
What if I stay this way
forever?

666
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,972
The antidote works quickly.
If we're right,

667
00:33:47,055 --> 00:33:48,937
you should be back
to your old self in no time.

668
00:33:48,979 --> 00:33:50,484
My old self was boring.

669
00:33:50,526 --> 00:33:51,948
<i>Can't we keep the new self?</i>

670
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,913
Just lay down,
and stop unbuttoning.

671
00:33:56,923 --> 00:33:59,183
I'm sorry
that I read your note

672
00:33:59,224 --> 00:34:01,231
and looked in your locker.

673
00:34:01,315 --> 00:34:04,452
You get used to that
kind of thing around here.

674
00:34:04,534 --> 00:34:06,793
Do you have anyone going
with you to Rome?

675
00:34:06,877 --> 00:34:08,215
Is that your
passive-aggressive way

676
00:34:08,299 --> 00:34:09,721
of asking me
if I'm seeing somebody else?

677
00:34:09,763 --> 00:34:10,892
I hope you are.

678
00:34:10,975 --> 00:34:13,777
I mean...I hope
you have someone with you.

679
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,491
If I'm scared about this,

680
00:34:15,575 --> 00:34:17,414
I can't imagine
how you must feel.

681
00:34:17,499 --> 00:34:19,632
You shouldn't be alone.

682
00:34:19,715 --> 00:34:21,513
If you want...

683
00:34:21,596 --> 00:34:23,562
I could fly over
for a few days.

684
00:34:23,604 --> 00:34:26,322
Friends.

685
00:34:26,406 --> 00:34:28,455
I appreciate that,

686
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:30,797
but I think I'll be okay.

687
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,469
I guess we took
the long way around

688
00:34:32,511 --> 00:34:34,518
to being friends, huh?

689
00:34:37,529 --> 00:34:40,499
I guess we all did.

690
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:47,441
Thank you.

691
00:34:47,524 --> 00:34:49,030
For everything.

692
00:34:49,072 --> 00:34:51,873
You're welcome.

693
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:53,211
For everything.

694
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:57,602
I'll see you tomorrow.

695
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,547
<i>I really do have to leave.</i>

696
00:35:08,434 --> 00:35:10,567
I know.

697
00:35:12,615 --> 00:35:15,835
What's the problem?

698
00:35:18,052 --> 00:35:21,899
This isn't gonna work.

699
00:35:28,506 --> 00:35:30,722
That's it?

700
00:35:30,806 --> 00:35:33,023
You can't just...
Say that and shut up.

701
00:35:33,065 --> 00:35:34,905
It's just
a statement of fact.

702
00:35:34,988 --> 00:35:38,290
It's not
a debatable proposition.

703
00:35:38,375 --> 00:35:42,054
Right. Because you can
see the future.

704
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:44,480
No. But I can see
the past.

705
00:35:44,565 --> 00:35:45,944
And you're gonna remember

706
00:35:46,027 --> 00:35:48,746
all the horrible things
I've done,

707
00:35:48,788 --> 00:35:50,418
and you're gonna
try to convince yourself

708
00:35:50,502 --> 00:35:52,092
that I've changed.

709
00:35:52,134 --> 00:35:54,349
And I'm gonna start doing
those horrible things again,

710
00:35:54,434 --> 00:35:56,818
because I haven't changed.

711
00:35:56,902 --> 00:35:59,452
Then you'll realize that...

712
00:36:03,216 --> 00:36:06,895
I'm an insane choice
for someone who has a kid.

713
00:36:06,978 --> 00:36:08,484
And from there,

714
00:36:08,568 --> 00:36:10,450
it's a short step
to the inevitable conclusion

715
00:36:10,492 --> 00:36:14,256
that all of this...

716
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,263
Was a mistake.

717
00:36:19,692 --> 00:36:22,744
Tell me any of that
isn't true.

718
00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:33,073
Mercy doesn't have
enough room in their ICU

719
00:36:33,115 --> 00:36:34,370
to handle the overflow, so--

720
00:36:34,412 --> 00:36:35,750
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

721
00:36:35,792 --> 00:36:37,590
I believe you wanted to talk
to Dr. Richardson,

722
00:36:37,673 --> 00:36:39,597
our Neurosurgeon?

723
00:36:39,681 --> 00:36:42,232
I'm sorry that we met
under such trying circumstances.

724
00:36:42,274 --> 00:36:44,783
I hope you restore our rating
as a level one Trauma Center

725
00:36:44,824 --> 00:36:46,790
and reopen the E.R.
and the ICU immediately.

726
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:48,505
An accidental case
of poisoning.

727
00:36:48,588 --> 00:36:50,052
Dr. Richardson
has been treated

728
00:36:50,135 --> 00:36:51,516
and is ready to resume work.

729
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,731
Hmm.

730
00:36:53,816 --> 00:36:56,617
Touch your nose
with your index finger

731
00:36:56,659 --> 00:36:58,835
and tell me how you treat
a cerebral contusion.

732
00:36:58,918 --> 00:37:01,761
Uh, I-I-I would watch
for edema

733
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:04,020
and transtentorial
herniation.

734
00:37:05,734 --> 00:37:07,615
Good enough.

735
00:37:07,699 --> 00:37:09,664
Turn it around.

736
00:37:09,706 --> 00:37:11,713
You're gonna be up late.

737
00:37:11,755 --> 00:37:14,976
Next time...
Avoid responsibility.

738
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,230
Cake?

739
00:37:16,272 --> 00:37:17,986
Taub thought we should
have a little party

740
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,701
to see you off properly.

741
00:37:19,743 --> 00:37:21,415
He gets sentimental
about these things.

742
00:37:21,499 --> 00:37:23,422
I never should have
flashed him.

743
00:37:23,465 --> 00:37:25,933
Speaking of which...

744
00:37:26,016 --> 00:37:28,483
Earlier today
I asked you about...

745
00:37:28,566 --> 00:37:30,281
Having sex.

746
00:37:30,323 --> 00:37:31,619
You gave me a look

747
00:37:31,661 --> 00:37:34,380
that almost certainly
could only mean no.

748
00:37:34,463 --> 00:37:37,515
However, on the other hand,
I'd be remiss if I...

749
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,527
Didn't follow up
and confirm.

750
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:42,660
See? It's the same look.

751
00:37:42,743 --> 00:37:44,499
So if it didn't mean no
the first time,

752
00:37:44,583 --> 00:37:46,005
then...
No.

753
00:37:46,046 --> 00:37:47,719
No. No, no.

754
00:37:47,803 --> 00:37:49,309
No.
Okay.

755
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,563
No pressure.

756
00:37:50,646 --> 00:37:52,821
Does that method
ever work?

757
00:37:54,243 --> 00:37:56,041
At least once.

758
00:38:04,153 --> 00:38:06,998
Mm, I'm, um...
Getting mixed signals.

759
00:38:07,082 --> 00:38:09,339
See you at the cake.

760
00:38:12,768 --> 00:38:14,275
The only time
you're afraid

761
00:38:14,316 --> 00:38:17,326
is when you're happy.

762
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:19,376
You just don't
expect it to last.

763
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,052
'Cause it doesn't.

764
00:38:22,136 --> 00:38:24,060
You don't know that.

765
00:38:26,191 --> 00:38:28,827
I've done
horrible things to you.

766
00:38:28,911 --> 00:38:33,384
And I'll do horrible
things again to you.

767
00:38:33,468 --> 00:38:35,518
But because of one
stupid moment

768
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:39,449
with a dying girl
and a pile of rubble...

769
00:38:39,532 --> 00:38:41,288
You think I can change.

770
00:38:43,714 --> 00:38:46,391
Tell me where I'm wrong.

771
00:38:49,736 --> 00:38:53,039
I don't want you
to change.

772
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:56,260
I know
you're screwed up.

773
00:38:56,302 --> 00:38:59,061
I know you are always
gonna be screwed up.

774
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:02,072
But you're the most
incredible man I've ever known.

775
00:39:06,254 --> 00:39:09,265
You are always gonna be...

776
00:39:09,307 --> 00:39:12,737
The most incredible man
I have ever known.

777
00:39:14,659 --> 00:39:17,670
So unless you're
breaking up with me,

778
00:39:17,712 --> 00:39:20,180
I am going home now.

779
00:39:31,972 --> 00:39:34,899
I love you.

780
00:39:36,698 --> 00:39:39,459
âª Oh, yeah, and later on âª

781
00:39:39,542 --> 00:39:41,673
âª we took a southbound train âª

782
00:39:41,758 --> 00:39:45,103
âª yeah, and it was cold out âª

783
00:39:45,146 --> 00:39:46,943
âª yeah, it was freezing
down rain âª

784
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:49,620
âª yeah, and it'll let up âª

785
00:39:49,661 --> 00:39:50,749
âª if we all screamed
for the change âª

786
00:39:50,791 --> 00:39:52,631
where's Thirteen?

787
00:39:52,714 --> 00:39:54,805
I don't think
she's coming.

788
00:39:54,889 --> 00:39:57,315
What's going on?

789
00:39:57,398 --> 00:39:59,782
She's not going to Rome.

790
00:39:59,824 --> 00:40:01,497
You mean
she changed her mind?

791
00:40:01,579 --> 00:40:02,668
I called
the hospital in Rome

792
00:40:02,751 --> 00:40:03,755
to see when she was
schedule for surgery.

793
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,719
<i>Why would you--
doesn't matter.</i>

794
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:08,898
Point is, she's not
even in the trial.

795
00:40:08,983 --> 00:40:11,867
Never heard of her.

796
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:15,254
She's been lying to us
all day.

797
00:40:15,338 --> 00:40:16,718
Well, have you tried--

798
00:40:16,759 --> 00:40:19,394
<i>both her phone lines
have been disconnected.</i>

799
00:40:19,477 --> 00:40:22,488
She's just gone.

800
00:40:22,572 --> 00:40:27,048
âª No, no,
just the good days âª

801
00:40:27,089 --> 00:40:29,766
âª yeah, yeah,
just the good days âª

802
00:40:29,807 --> 00:40:32,274
it's gonna be great.

803
00:40:32,316 --> 00:40:34,281
Yeah.

804
00:40:34,324 --> 00:40:35,955
âª Just the good days âª

805
00:40:35,996 --> 00:40:43,816
âª âª
