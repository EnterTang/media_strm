What's the matter? It's the Doctor!

-I can see that. Tell the Brigadier.
-Right, Miss Shaw.

00:02:15,585 --> 00:02:18,258
STAHLMAN: It's perfectly straightforward, Petra.

10
00:02:18,345 --> 00:02:20,540
We boost all power circuits to maximum load

11
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:24,538
and that'll give us a further acceleration of 3.6%.

12
00:02:25,585 --> 00:02:28,338
Well, do you find some fault in my calculations?

13
00:02:28,425 --> 00:02:30,336
Of course not, Professor Stahlman.

14
00:02:30,425 --> 00:02:32,302
Well, then, what's the matter?

15
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:35,743
We're already 1 2% over the planned acceleration.

16
00:02:35,825 --> 00:02:38,658
Another 3% will take us
well over the safety margin.

17
00:02:38,745 --> 00:02:42,624
The safety margins are for cautious old women
like Sir Keith.

I know perfectly well what I'm doing.
Pass on my instructions, please.

You look worried.

20
00:02:54,025 --> 00:02:56,903
He's ordered a further acceleration, 3.6%.

21
00:02:56,985 --> 00:02:59,101
-But he can't do that.
-I'm afraid he can.

22
00:02:59,185 --> 00:03:02,734
-We're pushing the safety limits now.
-Yes, I know.

23

I'm gonna have a word with him.

Greg, it's no use.

25
00:03:07,905 --> 00:03:10,703
-He usually listens to me, but this time...
-But not any more, eh?

26
00:03:10,785 --> 00:03:13,538
Let's face it, Petra, he's losing his grip.

-But he can still make mistakes, can't he?

29
00:03:19,905 --> 00:03:22,294
If he makes one at this stage, it could be a lulu!

30

-Yes, uh... I have a headache, that's all.

-You really ought to go to the sickbay.
-I'm perfectly all right.

Look, Professor Stahlman,
this accelerated drilling, it just isn't on, you know.

45
00:04:20,305 --> 00:04:23,058
So someone else is about to tell me
how to run my own project.

46
00:04:23,145 --> 00:04:26,182
We should be slowing down at this stage,
not forcing the pace.

47
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:28,825
The drilling will continue at the pace I decide.

for years, right?

What's the mad rush in the last few hours?

50
00:04:33,425 --> 00:04:36,735

-Yes, I saw it.

-Yes.

Well, what's the matter with him?

63
00:05:20,465 --> 00:05:22,183
Some sort of coma.

64

How long before he comes out of it?

65

Difficult to say.

66

Could be a few hours, a few months.

-Months?
-Some people never recover.

-I'll send for a doctor.
-I happen to be a doctor, Brigadier, remember?

69
00:05:38,985 --> 00:05:40,862
Well, shouldn't he be in hospital?

70
00:05:40,945 --> 00:05:43,140
It could be very dangerous to move him at all.

-Why not? It's quiet.

-Well, the man didn't do a very good job,

78
00:06:00,065 --> 00:06:02,420
and at the rate we're drilling,
that flange could blow at any moment.

If you could slow down the drilling rate,
I can get a proper job done.

-Another transparent excuse for delay.
-Excuse nothing!

82
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:11,861
At the speed we're drilling,
we could blow this place sky high

00:09:44,025 --> 00:09:45,981
Professor Stahlman would never permit it.

156
00:09:46,065 --> 00:09:48,295
-Just do it.
-Why not?

157
00:09:48,385 --> 00:09:50,023
What about it, Petra?

158
00:09:50,825 --> 00:09:52,019
Come on!

159
00:10:04,025 --> 00:10:06,016
-Well, I reckon it's working.
-Seems to be.

160
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,379
That was a brilliant idea of yours.

161
00:10:07,465 --> 00:10:09,342
-It wasn't my idea.
-Well, then who?

162
00:10:09,425 --> 00:10:11,700
No, don't tell me, the Doctor. I heard he was back.

163
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:13,457
That's right, the Doctor.

164
00:10:16,385 --> 00:10:18,137
I gave no such orders.

165
00:10:18,225 --> 00:10:20,102
No, Professor Stahlman, I did.

166
00:10:20,905 --> 00:10:22,543
Even you, Petra.

167
00:10:29,225 --> 00:10:31,739
LIZ: (ECHOING) Doctor, are you all right?

168
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:40,020
Liz?

169
00:10:41,425 --> 00:10:43,063
It is Liz.

170
00:10:43,145 --> 00:10:45,340
BRIGADIER: How are you, Doctor?

171
00:10:45,425 --> 00:10:46,904
Fine, Brigadier.

172
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:52,901
You know, you really do look better
with that moustache.

173
00:10:54,345 --> 00:10:55,858
Delirious. Poor chap.

174
00:10:58,705 --> 00:11:02,584
Doctor, you really ought to rest.
You've been unconscious.

175
00:11:02,665 --> 00:11:04,815
Yes, I'm very well aware of that.

176
00:11:13,025 --> 00:11:15,858
Well, the pulse seems to be more or less normal...

177
00:11:17,265 --> 00:11:18,698
at 1 70.

178
00:11:22,185 --> 00:11:25,734
Yeah. Yes, both ticking away quite nicely.

179
00:11:28,225 --> 00:11:32,184
Although the right one seems a fraction faster.
Still, that's only to be expected, isn't it?

180
00:11:32,265 --> 00:11:35,735
Doctor, where did you go?
Where did the Tardis console take you?

181
00:11:36,545 --> 00:11:40,618
Same time, same place,
only a different dimension.

182
00:11:42,825 --> 00:11:44,781
It was a parallel world, Liz.

183
00:11:45,545 --> 00:11:47,695
Terrible things are happening there.

184
00:11:48,225 --> 00:11:49,863
Terrible things.

185
00:11:50,785 --> 00:11:54,016
It wasn't this Earth, and yet it was.

186
00:11:55,745 --> 00:11:59,863
I didn't go backwards into the past
or forwards into the future, I...

187
00:12:01,945 --> 00:12:03,537
I slipped sideways.

188
00:12:09,665 --> 00:12:11,462
You must lie down.

189
00:12:11,545 --> 00:12:13,934
Brigade Leader...

190
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:18,416
that technician, the one who went berserk
and started killing people,

191
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:20,223
have you found him yet?

192
00:12:20,305 --> 00:12:21,420
No.

193
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:24,539
-And Stahlman, how's he?
-Still as difficult as ever.

194
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,298
-But no worse?
-Well, I haven't noticed.

195
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:29,694
How's the drilling?

196
00:12:29,785 --> 00:12:31,059
(KNOCKING)

197
00:12:31,145 --> 00:12:32,897
Just a minute.

198
00:12:38,865 --> 00:12:40,184
DOCTOR: Sir Keith!

199
00:12:40,265 --> 00:12:42,256
My dear fellow,
so you've come back to us after all.

200
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,017
So you're not dead?

201
00:12:44,105 --> 00:12:45,857
No, I came very close to it though.

202
00:12:45,945 --> 00:12:47,537
-Why, what happened?
-Car crash.

203
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,980
But you're not dead?

204
00:12:50,065 --> 00:12:51,783
You can see he's not dead.

205
00:12:53,265 --> 00:12:54,983
The Doctor's been ill, sir.

206
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,499
That's excellent! Excellent!

207
00:12:57,585 --> 00:13:00,099
Well, yes. Yes, I think so, too.

208
00:13:00,185 --> 00:13:04,258
Brigadier, I shall have to lay very serious charges
against Professor Stahlman.

209
00:13:04,345 --> 00:13:06,984
He ordered my chauffeur to delay my return.

210
00:13:07,065 --> 00:13:08,976
So not everything runs parallel.

211
00:13:09,985 --> 00:13:13,022
-He's been ill, you said?
-Yes, a coma.

212
00:13:13,105 --> 00:13:15,016
Yes, of course, of course.

213
00:13:15,105 --> 00:13:17,096
An infinity of universes,

214
00:13:17,185 --> 00:13:19,779
ergo an infinite number of choices.

215
00:13:22,065 --> 00:13:24,625
So free will is not an illusion after all.

216
00:13:26,665 --> 00:13:28,257
The pattern can be changed.

217
00:13:28,345 --> 00:13:31,576
BRIGADIER: Hello, get me the medical section,
will you? Thank you.

218
00:13:31,665 --> 00:13:33,144
-Now, look.
-Yes, very well.

219
00:13:33,225 --> 00:13:34,863
Now wait a minute.

220
00:13:34,945 --> 00:13:39,735
I'm not sick, I'm not in need of a doctor
and I'm not a raving idiot.

221
00:13:39,825 --> 00:13:41,497
No, no, no, of course not.

222
00:13:41,585 --> 00:13:43,621
Perhaps you've had some sort of nightmare.

223
00:13:43,705 --> 00:13:45,821
He did disappear. We saw him.

224
00:13:45,905 --> 00:13:47,133
Sir Keith,

225
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:51,537
unless we do something very, very quickly indeed,
there's going to be a disaster.

226
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,139
-How do you know, Doctor?
-Because I've already seen it!

227
00:13:55,185 --> 00:13:58,018
Professor Stahlman,
you must stop this drilling immediately!

228
00:13:58,105 --> 00:14:01,575
-Who let this maniac back in here?
-Do you hear me? Close down this operation now!

229
00:14:01,665 --> 00:14:03,860
-Brigadier, arrest this man.
-Listen to me, all of you!

230
00:14:03,945 --> 00:14:06,015
You are not to attempt
to penetrate the Earth's crust.

231
00:14:06,105 --> 00:14:08,096
-Brigadier, did you hear what I said?
-Doctor, please?

232
00:14:08,185 --> 00:14:11,257
Get out of my light! Now stop this drilling!

233
00:14:12,825 --> 00:14:14,577
-Doctor!
-Stop this drilling!

234
00:14:14,665 --> 00:14:16,974
-You don't understand, do you?
-Benton, get some help!

235
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:18,657
-Stop this drilling!
-Doctor, calm down!

236
00:14:18,745 --> 00:14:21,100
You see? Completely demented.

237
00:14:21,185 --> 00:14:24,655
All right, take him to the sickbay.
Be careful, I don't want him hurt!

238
00:14:24,745 --> 00:14:27,782
-No, you can't!
-Now, Liz, listen to me, computer...

239
00:14:27,865 --> 00:14:30,937
-There's a microcircuit missing.
-I'll look. Will you treat him carefully?

240
00:14:31,025 --> 00:14:32,583
Stop it! Stop this drilling!

241
00:14:32,665 --> 00:14:34,895
Brigadier, I hold you responsible.

242
00:14:34,985 --> 00:14:37,135
Professor Stahlman,
I'd like to speak to you, please.

243
00:14:37,225 --> 00:14:41,184
Ah, Sir Keith.
I thought you were supposed to be in London.

244
00:14:41,265 --> 00:14:42,618
An accident?

245
00:14:42,705 --> 00:14:45,299
This is a direct consequence
of your orders to my chauffeur.

246
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,500
Hmm?

247
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,541
(SCOFFING) Ridiculous.

248
00:14:49,385 --> 00:14:51,853
Professor, the Minister would like you
to report to him immediately.

249
00:14:51,945 --> 00:14:53,424
Oh, he would, would he?

250
00:14:53,505 --> 00:14:56,815
There's to be an inquiry into this project
and, if I may say so, into your conduct.

251
00:14:56,905 --> 00:15:00,022
You can make as many inquiries as you like,
my dear Gold,

252
00:15:00,105 --> 00:15:02,903
after we've penetrated the Earth's crust.

253
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:12,664
Professor Stahlman,
we'll be switching to robot controls in 49 minutes.

254
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,337
Thank you.

255
00:15:16,185 --> 00:15:18,016
Anything wrong, Professor?

256
00:15:18,105 --> 00:15:21,984
-I feel very cold in here.
-Cold?

257
00:15:22,065 --> 00:15:25,614
Yeah, have the maintenance people
raise the temperature.

258
00:15:25,705 --> 00:15:28,094
-But it's running normally.
-Do as I say.

the last phase of this operation alone.

-I can't.

310
00:19:53,585 --> 00:19:56,224
-Is there anything you can do?
-I can only try.

311
00:19:59,385 --> 00:20:03,424
<i>Zero minus one minute,</i>
<i>zero seconds and counting.</i>

312
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:06,253
<i>Final countdown commences now.</i>

313
00:20:09,945 --> 00:20:13,620
<i>Zero minus fifty seconds. Stand by.</i>

314
00:20:17,745 --> 00:20:19,895
<i>Attention. Attention.</i>

315
00:20:20,425 --> 00:20:25,294
<i>Countdown drilling stopped at minus 35 seconds.</i>

316
00:20:25,385 --> 00:20:26,659
(ALL CHEERING)

317
00:20:26,745 --> 00:20:28,861
<i>All systems are...</i>

318
00:20:31,065 --> 00:20:32,896
Sir Keith...

319
00:20:32,985 --> 00:20:36,341
I think you better give orders
for that shaft to be filled in straightaway.

320
00:20:36,425 --> 00:20:38,256
Indeed I will.

321
00:20:40,465 --> 00:20:42,456
I'll send for a stretcher party.

322
00:20:43,705 --> 00:20:47,584
♪ Shine on Martian moons up in the sky ♪

323
00:20:47,985 --> 00:20:49,498
Join in, Liz. Come on.

324
00:20:49,585 --> 00:20:51,303
♪ Shine on

325
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:54,140
♪ Shine on Martian moons ♪

326
00:20:55,865 --> 00:20:58,584
Sorry to disturb you, Doctor.
I just popped in to say goodbye.

327
00:20:58,665 --> 00:21:00,895
-Are you leaving, Sir Keith?
-Everyone is.

328
00:21:00,985 --> 00:21:03,863
Word came through this morning.
This project is being officially abandoned.

329
00:21:03,945 --> 00:21:05,458
I'm not sorry to hear that.

330
00:21:05,545 --> 00:21:08,423
-And what about the nuclear reactor?
-They're dismantling it tomorrow.

331
00:21:08,505 --> 00:21:10,735
Oh, but there's time for me
to use it just once more, I hope?

332
00:21:10,825 --> 00:21:13,180
Oh, yes, of course, with pleasure.
It's the least we can do.

333
00:21:13,265 --> 00:21:15,574
Thank you, Sir Keith.
By the way, how's Sutton and Miss Williams?

334
00:21:15,665 --> 00:21:17,701
-Oh, they've left already.
-Together?

335
00:21:17,785 --> 00:21:20,857
Well, I believe he is
driving her to London in his car.

336
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:24,142
Nothing like a nice happy ending, is there?

337
00:21:24,225 --> 00:21:26,944
-Well, goodbye, Doctor.
-Goodbye, Sir Keith.

338
00:21:27,305 --> 00:21:29,500
-Goodbye, Miss Shaw.
-Bye-bye, Sir Keith.

339
00:21:31,865 --> 00:21:33,093
Goodbye, Brigadier.

340
00:21:33,185 --> 00:21:36,461
Oh, there's quite a lot of mopping up to do.
I shall be around for quite a while yet.

341
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,183
Oh, pity.

342
00:21:38,265 --> 00:21:40,699
Come on, Liz.
If we're going to link up to that nuclear reactor,

343
00:21:40,785 --> 00:21:42,821
-we better get a move on.
-Just a moment, Doctor...

344
00:21:42,905 --> 00:21:46,454
You're not still tinkering with this machine
after all the trouble it's caused us?

345
00:21:46,545 --> 00:21:48,775
The trouble it's caused you?

346
00:21:48,865 --> 00:21:51,299
Doctor, if you hadn't chosen
such a crucial moment to disappear,

347
00:21:51,385 --> 00:21:53,694
this whole business might have been cleared up
a great deal sooner!

348
00:21:53,785 --> 00:21:55,696
He did try to warn everybody, Brigadier.

349
00:21:55,785 --> 00:21:57,980
And a fat lot of notice you all took.

350
00:21:58,065 --> 00:22:00,374
So you went gallivanting off in a fit of pique.

351
00:22:00,465 --> 00:22:02,023
Brigadier...

352
00:22:02,105 --> 00:22:06,018
there are times when you strongly remind me
of your other self.

353
00:22:06,985 --> 00:22:08,498
I shall leave at once.

354
00:22:09,825 --> 00:22:11,861
-In the Tardis console?
-Naturally.

355
00:22:11,945 --> 00:22:13,663
Oh, but Doctor, you can't!

356
00:22:14,785 --> 00:22:18,300
With the work that we did today,
the Tardis console is now fully operational.

357
00:22:18,385 --> 00:22:20,455
We seem to have heard that before.

358
00:22:23,105 --> 00:22:26,302
Goodbye, Liz. I shall miss you, my dear.

359
00:22:27,585 --> 00:22:31,817
But I've had about all I can stand
of this pompous, self-opinionated idiot here!

360
00:22:40,945 --> 00:22:43,095
Now see what you've done!

361
00:22:43,185 --> 00:22:45,938
Well, I didn't know he'd go off like that.
The man's so infernally touchy.

362
00:22:46,025 --> 00:22:49,859
I shall be most interested to see
how you get on without him, Brigadier.

363
00:22:49,945 --> 00:22:52,823
May I remind you, Miss Shaw,
that you're still a serving member of UNIT?

364
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:55,658
-I don't entirely care for your tone.
-I don't much care for yours, either.

365
00:22:55,745 --> 00:22:57,622
No wonder the Doctor cleared off.

366
00:22:57,705 --> 00:22:58,979
Ahem.

367
00:22:59,065 --> 00:23:02,102
BRIGADIER: Welcome back!
LIZ: Where did you go?

368
00:23:02,185 --> 00:23:04,415
A few seconds forward in time

369
00:23:05,265 --> 00:23:08,462
and a few hundred yards due east in space.

370
00:23:09,065 --> 00:23:10,703
The rubbish tip?

371
00:23:11,465 --> 00:23:14,218
-The rubbish tip.
-LIZ: (CHUCKLING) Oh, dear!

372
00:23:15,065 --> 00:23:16,384
Um...

373
00:23:17,665 --> 00:23:19,303
Brigadier, my dear fellow,

374
00:23:19,385 --> 00:23:21,945
I wonder whether I could borrow
a couple of your stalwart chaps

375
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:24,255
to give me a hand in bringing the Tardis back.

376
00:23:24,345 --> 00:23:27,098
It's landed in rather an inaccessible position.

377
00:23:28,185 --> 00:23:33,213
''Pompous, self-opinionated idiot''
I believe you said, Doctor.

378
00:23:34,905 --> 00:23:38,944
Yes, well, we don't want to bear a grudge
for a few hasty words, do we?

379
00:23:39,425 --> 00:23:42,462
No, not after all the years
that we've worked together.

380
00:23:42,665 --> 00:23:44,303
Now come along, my dear fellow.

381
00:23:44,385 --> 00:23:47,104
Put on a smile! Just remember...
