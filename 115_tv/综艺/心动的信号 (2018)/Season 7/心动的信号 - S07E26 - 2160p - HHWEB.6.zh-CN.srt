480
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:39,323
Good idea.
We can't afford

481
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:42,226
to have him making
any more duplicates.

482
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:45,428
DONATELLO:
Can you imagine what might
happen if he made six Shredders?

483
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,598
MICHELANGELO:
Yeah, or six Rocksteadys.

484
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,266
Or worse yet,
six Vernons.

485
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:53,069
Oh, come on.
That wouldn't be so bad.

486
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:55,539
VERNON [ON TV]:
<i>Sources say that the volcano</i>
<i>was put out</i>

487
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:58,141
<i>by the Teenage Mutant</i>
<i>Ninja Turtles,</i>

488
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:01,344
<i>but frankly, this reporter</i>
<i>doesn't believe it.</i>

489
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:04,648
On second thought,
that would be pretty horrifying.
