1
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,800
Got it.

2
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,200
I just intercepted the file.

3
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,700
Yeah of course I deleted
any trace of it.

4
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,900
This isn't the first time
I've de something like this.

5
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,400
I'll see you in a few.

6
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,700
Help!

7
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,900
Somebody's after me!

8
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,700
The roof!

9
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,100
Come on! Isn't this when you're
supposed to swoop in and save me?!

10
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,900
No pepper spray?

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,900
This city's a dangerous place.

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,600
You should be prepared.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,500
You can have my wallet.

14
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,400
You know that's not what I'm after.

15
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,500
Next time maybe you'll think twice before
you steal what doesn't belong to you.

16
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,800
<i>Finder’s keepers.</i>
I like the look.

17
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,000
Italian?

18
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,500
Why? You're thinking
of trading in your tights?

19
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,200
We were barely introduced.

20
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:57,700
<i>o/~  Somebody save me  o/~</i>

21
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,200
<i>o/~  Let your warm hands
break right through me  o/~</i>

22
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,200
<i>o/~  Somebody save me  o/~</i>

23
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,800
<i>o/~  I don't care how you do it  o/~</i>

24
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,700

25
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,500
<i>o/~  Come on  o/~</i>

26
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,200

29
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,800
<i>o/~  Come on  o/~</i>

30
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,800
Good morning.

31
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,600
Hi.

32
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,700
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

33
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,000
Well, I'm off.

34
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,300
Okay.

35
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,800
Wait! Hold the doors!

36
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,400
Dinah Lance - the word of justice,
thee right-wing hawk of the airwaves.

37
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,800
You're all dressed up.
Heading to an execution?

38
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,600
If you ever did
any fact-checking, Lois,

39
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,900
you'd know that the state
outlawed those years ago.

40
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,400
I'm sure you'll get over it
someday.

41
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,000
Well, if you're so in <i>the know</i>,
then I suppose you know

42
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,200
that your limousine-liberal casanova
has resurfaced.

43
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,400
Minus a certain shrill arm trophy.

44
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,700
Looking for a new hairdo?

45
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,400
Let me guess. Ham and Swiss?

46
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,600
- Your favorite.
- No, actually, not at all,

47
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,400
which I think I've mentioned three times
this week, but thanks anyway.

48
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,500
I just can't hang around
that house amore, Chloe.

49
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,500
Knowing that phantom was living
my life with Lana for over a month

50
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,000
while I was trapped in the fortress.

51
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,000
I know we looked alike, but she really
couldn't tell the difference?

52
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,300
And then she tells him
that they belong together.

53
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,500
Does that mean she doesn't
feel that way about me?

54
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,600
Well, she isn't exactly
the same girl

55
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,400
you used to trip all over
in high school, either.

56
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,500
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

57
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,000
Right.
I'm sorry I brought it up.

58
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,300
Any luck locating
the brain interactive construct?

59
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,400
Not since you asked me yesterday.

60
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,500
What happened to your face?

61
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,800
First of all, did you seriously
not notice this until just now?

62
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,700
Don't worry, Clark. I'm fine.

63
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,500
Chloe.

64
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,700
All right, I've sort of been doing
this sidekick side job for Oliver.

65
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,700
What?

66
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,300
Look, Clark,
a girl has got to pay her bills.

67
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,300
and, I mean, let's face it,

68
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,500
you kind of fill my pro-bono quota.

69
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,500
His missions are dangerous.
And the fact he's taking you with him--

70
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,200
No, no, no,
it was just internet interception

71
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,100
that ended up having a vicious
ninja lady attached to it,

72
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,400
who chased me onto the roof
and then almost beheaded me,

73
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,900
and went rappelling over the side
of the building, which I've got to admit

74
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,200
was really smokin' cool.

75
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,600
Who was she?

76
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,800
You put Chloe in danger!

77
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,900
So, I take it we're skipping
over the whole

78
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,800
"hello good to see you again,"
part of the conversation?

79
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,500
If you and your crew want to go out there
and put your own lives on the line,

80
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,900
that's fine.
Go ahead! But not Chloe!

81
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,100
Smart doesn't help when someone's
trying to attack you on a rooftop!

82
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,900
First of all, I don't think our leather-fetish
mystery woman was trying to kill Chloe.

83
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,600
She shouldn't have been in danger at all.

84
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,200
Secondly, Chloe's in danger like every
other week with you by her side, Clark.

85
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,100
You're the one who goes into things
without giving it a second thought.

86
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,400
Why don't you try to think about
someone other than yourself for once?

87
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,300
I'm selfish?

88
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,800
You know, some of us sacrifice being with
the people that we really care about,

89
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,900
so that we can go make a difference.

90
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,100
What do you do?

91
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,900
you sit around in domestic bliss,
curled up on a couch

92
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,800
while a world of trouble
spins outside your door!

93
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,100
This blond woman -

94
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,700
Chloe said
she shattered your arrows.

95
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,900
Not my proudest moment,
but, yeah.

96
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,600
She must have so kind
of sound-frequency control.

97
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,500
All the noise went muffled
right before it happened.

98
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,600
And the files she stole.
Chloe said she didn't know what it was.

99
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,300
I didn't tell her what it was.

100
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,100
We've intercepted Lex's
latest project.

101
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,600
It's a photo file.

102
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,200
And this masked woman
just happened to show up?

103
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,200
Maybe Lex has a blond sidekick
of his own.

104
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,900
I usually mind when someone
sits in the chair, but -

105
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,300
I'm a little distracted
to care at the moment.

106
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,800
I don't take to the morally murky.

107
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,400
Unless they pay you.

108
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,500
You know my standards.

109
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,300
No matter how rich you are,
you don't deserve to be robbed.

110
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,200
And you, <i>richie</i>, are a lucky man.

111
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,800
If you stopped whoever's been
hacking into my trade secrets,

112
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,400
I consider myself very lucky.

113
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,900
Your file almost
fell into the wrong hands.

114
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,400
I had little run-in
with an emerald archer.

115
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,200
Green Arrow?

116
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I wasn't expecting company.

117
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,900
You think you can find him again?

118
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,500
If I had a good reason.

119
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,400
They've been breaking in
and setting off bombs at my work sites.

120
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,600
They belong in prison.

121
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,300
You bring me Green Arrow,
and I will make it worth your while.

122
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'd like this back as soon as possible.
Thanks.

123
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,300
I, um - I've been calling the farm,
but no one answers.

124
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,200
It's as if the place
had been abandoned.

125
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,300
Or we have caller I.D.

126
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,200
The, um, editor
of the Daily Planet,

127
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,500
Grant Gabriel -

128
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,800
he's been shot and killed.

129
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,500
Let me guess.
You think Lex is behind it.

130
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,800
I do, yes. I think it's why
he bought the paper.

131
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,900
It's the beauty of a divorce, Lionel.

132
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Covering up Lex's baggage
is no longer my problem.

133
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,200
I don't want to cover it up, Lana.

134
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,700
I want proof.

135
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,400
I know you can get it for me.

136
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,500
Lex and I have kind of suspended
tea time together.

137
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,400
I know you have hours of footage -
spy footage on him,

138
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,400
and I'm sure I can find something
that will incriminate him.

139
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,900
What leads you to believe
that I would help you?

140
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,200
Several weeks ago,
you held a very sick woman hostage.

141
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,300
I was trying to help her.

142
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,100
And how did that work out for you,
bypassing the hospital?

143
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,300
Oh, oh, yes. that's right.
She died in your care.

144
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:51,100
You were very quick to share all this
with Clark's doppelganger, but -

145
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,100
why didn't you tell Clark?

146
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,900
Call me - when you're ready
for movie night.

147
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,400
I was hoping you could help me.

148
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,500
This vigilante woman attacked Chloe.

149
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,300
I thought maybe you'd know if
she was connected to Lex.

150
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,100
It's kind of interesting that everyone was
so quick to turn me into Lady Macbeth...

151
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,000
when they found out I was watching Lex.

152
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,800
And yet you're the second person
to ask for my help today.

153
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,400
The second person?

154
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,400
She's not in any of the old footage.
I would have remembered the mask.

155
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,200
Thanks. I appreciate it.

156
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,600
Clark...

157
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:04,100
when you were gone,
I was treating this woman.

158
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,200
She was catatonic
after Brainiac infected her.

159
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,900
What do you mean, "treating"?

160
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,100
Monitoring her. She -

161
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,500
Until she passed away.

162
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,500
She passed away?

163
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,600
There wasn't anything else we could do.
Her mind was already gone.

164
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,000
We were just looking for clues.

165
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,600
Who's "we"?

166
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,400
You told the phantom this?

167
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,600
Lana, why do you bother
telling me now?

168
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,300
Lionel's holding it over my head.

169
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,200
I can't do this, Lana.

170
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,200
You're only honest with me
when you're threatened.

171
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,800
- In a few weeks with him--
- I don't know what else to say to you.

172
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,000
I thought that he was you.

173
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,000
You're supposed to know me
better than anyone.

174
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,200
And that's why you're here
with me right now.

175
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,400
But it was easier with him,
wasn't it?

176
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,400
Yes. It was easier, Clark.

177
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,000
He was more affectionate.

178
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,100
He was more understanding.

179
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,800
Is that really
what you want to hear?

180
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,200
I can't even look at you
without you taking it the wrong way.

181
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,100
Because you're looking at me
like you wished I was someone else.

182
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,600
Every transgression that I have made,

183
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,600
you have answered
with a hypocritical judgment.

184
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,200
No one can live up to
your self-righteous standards.

185
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,300
Do you have any idea how it feels
to wake up every morning,

186
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,600
knowing that you're going fail in the eyes
of the only person you've ever really loved?

187
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,800
And you're the one
who fell in love with Lex...

188
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,600
and then fell for that killer.

189
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,600
I don't think it's me
you can't face.

190
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,800
I told him to give me call.

191
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,000
Lois.

192
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,300
This is gonna be
harder than I thought.

193
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,300
- That's for breaking my heart.
- Really?

194
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,000
'Cause it felt like it was for not calling
when I got back into town.

195
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,200
Oh, <i>that one</i> will come
when you least expect it.

196
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,400
Would you put a shirt on or something?

197
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,400
Well, at least I know why
I got canned from your speed dial.

198
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,900
The whole, uh, jumping-to-conclusions thing
before getting the full story -

199
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,900
how's that working out for you?

200
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,700
Huge time-saver.

201
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,700
The dinner's for you.

202
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,800
I knew you'd be on my doorstep.

203
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,700
and if you weren't,
I'd have been on yours.

204
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,000
I missed you.

205
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,300
More than you could possibly know.

206
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,300
If you think the glistening-muscle-
answering-the-door-

207
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,400
in-your-bare-chest routine
was gonna work...

208
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,200
you were dead-on.

209
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,100
You're all I could think about.

210
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,100
Nice try.

211
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,300
Does that work on all
the fishnet-leather-clad blondes...

212
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,200
you have stashed on the balcony?

213
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,800
Get down!

214
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,500
Ollie?

215
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,900
Ollie?

216
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,000
Oh, my god.

217
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,200
Lois?

218
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,500
Oh, don't even think
of looking at me right now.

219
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,800
So, in all those nights together,

220
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,800
somewhere between brushing teeth
and spooning in the sheets,

221
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,900
you didn't think that it might be a good time
to mention that you prowled the streets...

222
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,300
with green leather and a compound bow?

223
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,600
Well, I don't usually
bring the compound bow.

224
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,200
Oh, so, now he's a funny hero.

225
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,600
I can't believe you didn't tell me
you were Green Arrow!

226
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,400
Hard to imagine why
when you're taking it so well.

227
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,300
You think the lacerating ropes
and platinum fembot...

228
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,700
might have something to do
with my lack of empathy?

229
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,400
So, what? Little Ollie got bored
with dodge ball in P.E...

230
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,400
and decided to play William Tell?

231
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,100
Whoa. Wait a second.

232
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,700
I kissed Green Arrow last year when you
were standing there with me in the alley.

233
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,500
Yeah, I remember that
with precise detail.

234
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,900
I can't believe you!

235
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,400
You, who were supposedly
my boyfriend, arranged for me...

236
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,900
to be lip-locked
with some wannabe hero!

237
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,700
- Lois?!
- Ugh. How do you put up with that?

238
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,400
I don't know what it is
you want from me,

239
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,200
but I'm hoping we just got off
on the wrong foot.

240
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,000
You can save your charm for
your squawking parrot over there.

241
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,700
Whatever someone's paying you,
I can beat it.

242
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,200
You know, this is more than
just about money, pretty boy.

243
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,700
This is about something that you and your
merry band of thieves might not understand -

244
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,000
justice.

245
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,800
Lady Justice must be blinder
than I thought she was,

246
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,500
if she's got you on her side.

247
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,200
Just tell me this - what goes
through the mind of a terrorist...

248
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,500
when he's about to set off
a bomb in a factory?

249
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,700
A Terrorist?

250
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,100
You really have it backwards.

251
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,800
No one's ever been hurt,

252
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:24,100
and Lex's factories aren't exactly producing
Christmas toys for little girls and boys.

253
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,800
I'm the good guy!

254
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,500
Isn't everybody?

255
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,200
When I say I'm gonna do something,
I always deliver.

256
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,800
Now it's your turn.

257
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,300
You want your boy over here?
Start the wire transfer.

258
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,400
In case you can't see it,
the white flag is flying,

259
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,400
so don't even think
about going off on me again.

260
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,300
I'm sorry for being so hard on you...

261
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,400
about the Oliver thing.
I just don't want to see you getting hurt.

262
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,800
Well, we could all breathe easier if
we could find a lead on blonde ambition,

263
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,800
but right now, I've got zero.

264
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,300
Lana might.

265
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,800
Twist.

266
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,100
Okay.

267
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,400
She doesn't have any footage
linking Lex to the attacker,

268
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,000
but she was able to keep track
of his projects...

269
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,400
by piggybacking on the server
from Luthor mansion.

270
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,400
Of course.
Right in front of my face.

271
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,800
Our silent siren...

272
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,800
knew I was making the interception
because she was on the Daily Planet server.

273
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,400
Can you access
who logged on last night?

274
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,000
Yeah. I can't believe
I didn't see that.

275
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,100
The negligent go-to girl
strikes again.

276
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,200
chalk another one up
for the new-and-improved model.

277
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,800
Lana did come through,

278
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,500
but I'm not about to let Oliver
poach the best sidekick in town.

279
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,300
<i>Dinah Lance was the only woman
logged on last night.</i>

280
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,200
That doesn't help us much.

281
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,500
Why, because she's not blonde?

282
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,700
Please, Clark. The new bad girl
could be as blond as I really am.

283
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,900
There you go.
Raven black.

284
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,200
Canary yellow.

285
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,300
maybe we should call her
the Yellow Raven.

286
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,300
Black Canary
has a better ring to it.

287
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,200
This makes so much sense.

288
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,400
I mean, Dinah's slogan is
"The Word of Justice.”

289
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,600
Family of cops, hard-line view
of crime and corruption...

290
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,100
What are you doing?

291
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,200
Earning back my stripes.

292
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,400
I just hacked in to Dinah's
computer and it looks like...

293
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,500
there is a transfer in occurrence,

294
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,000
to her bank account right now.

295
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,300
Oliver said the file you intercepted
the other night was from Lex.

296
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,900
Can you block this transfer?

297
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,400
Cut off the air supply
so she'll have to surface.

298
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,600
Got it.

299
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,500
Missing your payoff?

300
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,600
Guess there's no honor among thieves.

301
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,900
Let me guess. You're one of
the green bean's little accomplices,

302
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
and now that your boss is all tied up,
you're out of work.

303
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,800
What'd you do with him?

304
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
Green Arrow isn't the villain here.
Lex is.

305
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,200
Even tycoons who buy out the press
deserve justice.

306
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,000
Is that the line you use to convince
yourself you're on the right side?

307
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
you know, you may not have
experienced this, stud boy,

308
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,300
but when you are on the right side,
you don't have to do any convincing.

309
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,100
Did it ever occur to you
there might be a reason...

310
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,100
why the Green Arrow
was stealing from Lex?

311
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,000
Actually, it didn't occur to me that
anything about Queen was reasonable.

312
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,500
Sorry. Green Arrow.

313
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,900
Next time you're a gun for hire,
do your research.

314
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,900
Why would a rich guy like Oliver

315
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,600
waste his time intercepting files
for the fun of it?

316
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,700
What line did Lex feed you?

317
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,000
That you and your little gang
were breaking into his plants...

318
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,200
all over the world,
stealing trade secrets.

319
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,700
I'm guessing he didn't tell you
what those secrets were.

320
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,500
Where's Oliver?

321
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,100
Well, aren't you clever?
You managed to sneak in.

322
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,700
Did you, uh, find anything?

323
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,400
I didn't find anything linking
Grant Gabriel's murder to Lex...

324
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,100
because I'm not looking.

325
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,500
Think, Lana. I -

326
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,500
you know what you've done,
lying to Clark, deceiving him.

327
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,500
Clark knows everything,

328
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,600
and he will know everything
from now on.

329
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,400
So, I guess your cards
are off the table.

330
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:57,600
Well, it's obvious that you adopted
more than just the Luthor name.

331
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:05,500
What about the part of you that
wanted to bring Lex to justice...

332
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,700
for all the evil that he's done?
Is that also off table?

333
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,500
Sometimes justice comes
at too high a price -

334
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,900
like sacrificing
my relationship with Clark...

335
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,900
because I wanted to see
Lex pay for his sins.

336
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,300
Why did you come here?

337
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,900
I went to the edge,
and Clark pulled me back.

338
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,200
I'm trying to the same thing for you.

339
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,300
So, this is because you have
my best interests at heart?

340
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,300
It's not about you.

341
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,200
I'm trying to change.

342
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,700
To be honest, to be the kind of person
that Clark could love again.

343
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,700
What game are you playing?

344
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,600
Lex is living proof
of what obsession can do.

345
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,900
- I know my son better than you.
- No, you don't.

346
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,800
Be careful.

347
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,600
Lois, what happened?

348
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,600
This crazy woman attacked us.

349
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,300
Why did some woman
attack you and Oliver?

350
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,800
Hey!

351
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,800
Isn't the view spectacular? I never
really noticed it before without the -

352
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,000
all the glass in the way.

353
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,600
The view?

354
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,800
I know. Can you believe this guy?
A hydraulic walk-in closet.

355
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,300
You're not gonna find that
in the Sharper Image catalog.

356
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,300
It must be laundry day.

357
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,300
I mean, who picks archery as a hobby?

358
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,800
That's embarrassing.
I'd keep my quiver in the closet, too.

359
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,000
Lois, where is Oliver?

360
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,000
I don't know.

361
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,000
She knocked me out, and when
I came to, they were both gone.

362
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,700
I think you forgot a little
green something at home.

363
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,400
I'm not handing Green Arrow over to you
until you can prove how bad he is.

364
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,300
The fact that he's been breaking
into my plants seems sufficient.

365
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,500
About those plants -
I've been doing a little digging.

366
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,200
It seems your auto-parts factory
doesn't sell any auto parts.

367
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,300
and your tech warehouse
doesn't distribute computers.

368
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,200
Looks like you've been
buying into his propaganda.

369
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,900
I don't like being caught
on the wrong side,

370
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,600
which is what I'm on, isn't it?

371
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,100
You were never gonna hand Green Arrow
over to the police, were you?

372
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:54,100
I'm not much for philosophical debates.
I just want what I paid for.

373
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:58,000
Well, then, I guess that answers my question.
I'm not handing him over.

374
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,600
- Where is he?
<i>- Try looking over your shoulder.</i>

375
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:07,000
Better luck next time, Lex.

376
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,500
Oliver... / Green Arrow.

377
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,000
Any other hyphenates
I need to know about?

378
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,000
No, that was pretty much the biggie.

379
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,400
I'm sorry.

380
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,300
I never meant to hide
who I was from you. I just -

381
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,200
No it's okay. I get it.
You were just trying to protect me.

382
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,200
Yeah.

383
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,100
And I got to say,
it clears up a lot.

384
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,300
It never did make sense how you
could blow off a hottie like me.

385
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,700
Right, that's true.

386
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,900
Well, now that you know...

387
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,400
I'm really hoping that...

388
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:38,400
I know my job takes me out
of town a lot, but...

389
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,900
on the weekends,
there - there's a -

390
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,100
I'm asking you.

391
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,300
Please give us another chance.

392
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,000
I can make this work.

393
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I can't.

394
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,900
You know me and my big mouth.
I can never keep a secret.

395
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,600
I don't believe that.

396
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,700
I've never been good
at long-distance relationships.

397
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,700
Come on, Lois.

398
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,100
Okay.

399
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,900
Maybe I'm selfish here...

400
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,600
but I don't want to wonder
where you are every night.

401
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,100
I don't think I'd be good at
the whole dual-identity thing.

402
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,400
I...

403
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,100
I can't.

404
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,200
I can't share you
with the rest of the world.

405
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,300
Enter at your own caloric risk.

406
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,500
How you doing?

407
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,300
Aside from the metaphor,

408
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,200
I was hoping Rocky Road would help,
but nothing, nada.

409
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,400
Not even a dent.

410
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:48,600
You know, I thought Grant
would help me get over Ollie,

411
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,800
and if that didn't end badly enough...

412
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,000
the moment I saw Ollie again,

413
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,000
all those feelings
just came rushing right back up.

414
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Maybe it can still work
between you two.

415
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,500
You don't know Ollie like I do.
There are parts of him you've never seen.

416
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,400
That's a given.

417
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I mean, sides of him.

418
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,400
He's got this one side that
I'm not sure I can live with.

419
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,800
How would you know
if you don't give it a chance?

420
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,600
We're not you and Lana.
We're not the perfect couple.

421
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,900
We are not destined for each other.

422
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,900
Lois, this isn't like you.

423
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,800
Normally, when things get challenging,
that's when you get interested.

424
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,500
This is different.

425
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,000
My dad was a general.

426
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,600
And he cared about me.

427
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,600
But I learned really early
that his role in the world...

428
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,900
was a lot more important
than being a father.

429
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,000
And you know what?
For good reasons.

430
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,200
And Ollie's life is demanding, too.

431
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,600
Lois, just because someone's
life has great responsibility...

432
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,300
doesn't mean your life
has to take second place.

433
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,600
Of course it does, Clark.

434
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,700
Can you imagine what it would be like...

435
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,500
to look into somebody's eyes and know that
their destiny is so much greater than yours,

436
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:14,700
that you will never compete?
You will always be left behind.

437
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,100
That would be hard for anyone, but...

438
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,700
No, I can't
be left behind one more time.

439
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,200
You know, where Ollie's life
is going,

440
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,700
there's not room for me in it,

441
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,200
and I know
he'd never admit that, so...

442
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,800
I had to.

443
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,900
I just, um...

444
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,500
I can't face another heartbreak
down the road.

445
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,700
Besides, you know, why settle for
hot, rich and famous -

446
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,900
when I can hang out with you?

447
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,000
I guess you got blondie's message, too.

448
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,800
I spoke to Lois.
I'm sorry about what happened.

449
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,400
Maybe she'll get used to
the whole dual-identity thing someday.

450
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,600
Yeah, like when?

451
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,800
When the Earth cracks open and time
ticks backwards? I don't think so.

452
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,500
Hey. Thanks for coming.

453
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,700
I guess I need to eat
a little crow, huh?

454
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,500
Is it too late
to ask for an apology?

455
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,200
Apology accepted,

456
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,300
assuming you stop
moonlighting for Lex.

457
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,600
That won't be a problem.
I've decided to hang up my fishnets.

458
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,800
<i>I think I was
a little out of my league.</i>

459
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,600
I'll just stick
to being the word of justice.

460
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,700
At least I can't hurt anyone
over the airwaves.

461
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,100
Well, as long as they're not
subsonic.

462
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,500
Still, I got to say...

463
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,500
it kind of seems like a waste.

464
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,300
Besides, Oliver and his boys
could always use a den mother.

465
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,700
It's true.

466
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,300
I'm not really much of a team player.

467
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,000
Really? That's perfect.
You're gonna fit right in.

468
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,600
What about you?

469
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,900
I'd say ricocheting bullets
off your back...

470
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,300
earns you the secret handshake.

471
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,200
Maybe someday.

472
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,100
Come on. There's a couple people
I want you to meet.

473
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,200
Has anyone ever told you
you have lousy taste in women?

474
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,300
<i>Yeah.</i>

475
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,300
Hi.

476
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,000
Hi.

477
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:40,700
I talked to Chloe. I thought I should
go stay with her for a few days.

478
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,300
I stole a Lamborghini.

479
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,300
I broke into a bank of ATM machines,
and I stole all the money.

480
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,200
I ripped off more vault doors
than I could count in a lifetime.

481
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,300
Lana I'm anything but perfect,

482
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,100
and I know that it's hard
to live with me, especially when...

483
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,900
Not everyone can handle
the double-sided life I live.

484
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,100
Clark, I've been
a two-headed hydra lately myself.

485
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,500
It's funny.
You can have all the right motives,

486
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,400
and still do all the wrong things.

487
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,700
I just wish I knew how
we ended up here.

488
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,800
But...

489
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,500
for what it's worth,
I am still committed to us.

490
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,100
You don't think I am?

491
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,800
Clark, I think that you doubt
whether I'm the one...

492
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,000
you're really going to end up with.

493
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,700
I can't tell you the future, Lana.

494
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,900
Honestly, I don't know
what's gonna happen to us.

495
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,200
But I promise I'm gonna do
everything I can to make sure...

496
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,000
that we can trust each other again.

497
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,300
I don't want this to be over.
