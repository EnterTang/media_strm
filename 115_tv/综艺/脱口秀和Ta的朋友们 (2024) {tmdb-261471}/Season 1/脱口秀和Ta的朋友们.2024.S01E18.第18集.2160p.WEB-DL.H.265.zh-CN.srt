00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,790
Top Gear 第18季 第1集
字幕制作: 百度TopGear吧 derekdi 清野过客 吃烧饼不掉芝麻

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,830
水平有限 难免有误 敬请谅解

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,320
非常感谢. 大家好!
Thank you so much. Hello!

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,040
大家晚上好,感谢光临!
Hello and welcome. Thank you, everybody. Thank you.

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:33,320
尽管最近以来这档节目在各种媒体上的声誉不高
Now, even though this programme has taken a 
terrible battering in the newspapers in recent weeks and months,

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,760
我们已经尽最大的努力使这个季度不受舆论影响
we have made every effort we possibly can 
to make sure this series is unaffected.

7
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,860
诚挚感谢大家
Thank you. Thank you, really.

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,590
谢谢
Thanks very much.

9
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:49,760
那么接下来就是一段以下七周节目的精彩内容剪辑
So, coming up now is a montage of 
what you can expect over the next seven weeks.

10
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,160
每加仑57英里! (约等于百公里4升)
57 miles to the gallon!

11
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,960
结论是,空间大,而且经济实惠
So, spacious...and economical.

12
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,080
转过第一弯..
Going through the first corner...

13
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,640
这就是凸轮轴的工作原理
And THAT is how a camshaft works.

14
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,520
老兄!
Mate!

15
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,280
不对!! 放错了
No-o-o! There's been a bit of a mistake.

16
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,000
那是给报纸媒体们送去的剪辑
为了蛊惑他们认为我们从良了
THAT is the tape we sent to the newspapers 
in the hope they'd be fooled into thinking

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,400
我们真正要放的剪辑是这个!
that's what we'll be doing.
What we're actually doing is THIS!

18
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,100
不妙! 我不想在后视镜里看见那个!
Oh, no! That's not what I wanted to see in the mirror!

19
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:30,690
来到轮胎墙..
Heading to the tyres...

20
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,990
他在那儿! 他在那儿!!
There he is! There he is!

21
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,000
左转进入阿卡西亚大街
(注:"阿卡西亚大街"是英国中产阶级的象征)
Turning left into Acacia Avenue.

22
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,400
在那边,在那边! 往那里开!!
Over there. Over there. Go over there!

23
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,450
他是Stig的中国表兄
He's The Stig's Chinese cousin.

24
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,010
稳住你的脊椎
Hold onto your spine.

25
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,310
约翰逊的起步很出色
Johnson makes a good start.

26
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,620
快开啊,你个老破玩意儿!
Come on, you little bugger!

27
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,630
天呐,这里能抓到不少好镜头
Man alive! Are we getting some shots here?!

28
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,600
不好意思,我只是打酱油的
Thank you. Just browsing.

29
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,250
努力,努力,努力! 加油!!
Stretch it, stretch it, stretch it!
Come on!

30
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,280
那怎么可能?!
How's that possible?

31
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,010
干的太漂亮了
Oh... That was beautiful.

32
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:45,390
那些内容都即将播出,不过我们今晚从它说起
All of that is to come,
but we kick off tonight with this.

33
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,630
没错,因为这个很重要
Yes, because this is important.

34
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,270
比方说,你想要一辆中置引擎的超级跑车
Let's say you want a mid-engine supercar 

35
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,990
不过出于某种原因,你不想要法拉利458
but, for some reason, you don't want a Ferrari 458.

36
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:56,790
那么你应该选哪辆呢?
What is best for you?

37
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,270
毫无疑问的是,我们仨不能达成共识
Now, naturally, of course,
us three could not agree on a solution on this,

38
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:07,180
所以制片人让我们用一次横跨意大利的路试来一决高下
so the producer said we had to settle 
our differences with a road trip across Italy.

39
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:15,910
我们的聚集点是美丽的莱切城,它位于亚平宁之靴的足根处
'The meeting point was the beautiful 
town of Lecce, in the heel of Italy,

40
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:19,040
我是第一个到的
'and I was the first to arrive.'

41
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,960
这就是迈凯轮MP4-12C
This is the McLaren MP4-12C.

42
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,770
它对于细节的追求简直令人发指
It's a car made with an almost
psychotic attention to detail.

43
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:35,730
它非常高科技,所以我觉得它会很适合我
It's very technical. It's why, I think, 
it probably suits me quite well.

44
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,570
然后杰里米开着一辆很适合他的车到了
Then Jeremy arrived in a car
that suits HIM quite well.

45
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,340
早上好,"低调君"
Morning, shrinking violet.

46
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,160
这个嘛..
This...

47
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,840
就是兰博基尼Aventador了
..is a Lamborghini Aventador.

48
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:02,300
关于这车我最喜欢的一点是
奥迪揽了引擎啊电线啊这些无趣的活儿
What I love most of all about this is that 
Audi did all the boring engine and wiring bits

49
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,520
而留给兰博基尼在造型上耍宝
and then let Lamborghini go mad with the styling.

50
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,110
造型上比你的强得多,于是它就是更好
It looks better than yours and, 
therefore, it IS better.

51
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,870
没错. 作为一直以来的海报尤物,兰博基尼一直处于顶尖
I agree. As a poster,
as Lamborghinis always have been, it is superb.

52
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,040
外形让人无话可说
It looks great.

53
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,030
不过老实说,这车长的有点恐龙了
But it's a bit of a dinosaur, to be honest. 

54
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:22,240
-它太大,太宽..  -你说啥?!
-这辆车,你看上去就知道..
It's too big, it's too wide. I'm sorry?! 
This, you just know...

55
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,030
这辆车的工程师张口闭口就谈G力. 他们就坐在那儿
All they ever talked about was G.
They were sitting going,

56
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,060
"我们怎么能让这辆车过弯再快一点?"
"How can we make it go round
a corner a little bit faster?"

57
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:34,580
-它是辆超跑!  -对啊! 给它配枪吧! 再装上个火箭吧!
It's a supercar. "So give it guns!
Let's give it guns! Space rockets!"

58
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:39,540
看这个,它们估计开了7年的会议来决定雨刷器的造型
This - they will have had seven years of meetings 
to get to that windscreen wiper.

59
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:45,230
-所以它能够工作正常,这又有什么错?
-兰博基尼工程师会说, "我们为啥不用激光?"
So it works properly. What's wrong with that? 
Lamborghini would've said, "Why don't we use a laser?

60
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,200
"我们为啥不用激光往玻璃上喷热气?"
"Why don't we have lasers shooting
heat onto the windscreen to...?"

61
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,350
-这才是我热爱兰博的原因,它们头脑疯狂!
-你今天汽水喝多了吧?!
That's why I love Lambos. They're mental. 
Have you had a lot of pop today?

62
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,050
这时候,哈蒙德开了一辆Noble M600到达了
'At that moment, Hammond arrived, in a Noble M600.' 

63
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,850
-哈蒙德..  -早上好
-让我们搞搞清楚
So, Hammond... Morning.
Let's just get this straight.

64
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,860
你还真觉得这世界上有人会想
You think there are people
in the world who are going to say,

65
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,480
"恩,我不想要一辆异国的意大利跑车,不要法拉利"
"No, I don't want something Italian and exotic. 
Don't want a Ferrari.

66
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,260
"我想要一辆莱切斯特轻工业工棚里造出来的东西"
I want something built on a light industrial
unit in Leicestershire."

67
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:20,020
等等,我觉得你买这辆车的唯一原因就是
它的引擎来自于沃尔沃XC90
No, wait a minute. Sorry. You buy this, I think, 
because it's got the engine from a Volvo XC90.

68
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:24,350
没错,它的引擎确实是沃尔沃引擎,不过是雅马哈制造的
No! Yes, the engine may be from
a Volvo, but it's made by Yamaha.

69
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:29,320
匹配卓越的双引擎,而且更出色的是,这辆车很轻
It's twin-engine, it's absolutely magnificent, 
and this car, above everything else, is light.

70
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,520
这就像是 拿我和你比较
Comparing these - it's like comparing me with you.

71
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,450
它的马力重量比例很疯狂 - 每吨541匹马力
The power-to-weight ratio is insane.
541 brake horsepower per tonne in there.

72
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,090
那已经可以和布加迪威龙相提并论了,这你是知道的!
That's Bugatti Veyron territory, and you know it!

73
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:45,810
用这辆车击败你们肯定就像碾过甲壳虫一样容易
This is going to crush you guys 
like beetles under its feet.

74
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,540
很快,我们的跑车吸引了一群闲杂人等..
Soon, our cars started to draw a bit of a crowd...

75
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:58,000
于是制片人让我们出城,并在乡下撒撒欢
..so the producer said we should leave the town 
and go for a little drive in the country.

76
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,790
老天爷啊!
Bloody hellfire!

77
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,940
不赖
Quite good.

78
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,220
你也许在坐下心想,"为什么我要花22万8千英镑"
You are probably sitting there, thinking, 
"Hold on! Why would I spend 228,000 pounds

79
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,730
"买一辆莱切斯特造的,没有气囊和ABS的跑车?"
"on a car with no airbags or
anti-lock brakes, made in Leicester?"

80
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,090
不过这不是重点
But that's missing the point.

81
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,520
如果我问另外那两人,历史上最棒的超级跑车是哪一辆
If I were to ask those two what the
best supercar ever made is,

82
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,120
我能猜到他们的答案
I know what they'd answer.

83
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,630
法拉利F40
Ferrari F40.

84
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,770
这辆车就含有那种"法拉利F40主义"
There's something of the Ferrari F40 about this.

85
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,550
这与它的驾乘感受有很大的关系
Something to do with the way it rides on the road, 
the way it feels.

86
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,430
也许是它的简约使其如此卓越
The simplicity of it.

87
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,520
我知道超跑一般都会很花哨,这点我清楚
I buy the argument for a flamboyant supercar. 
I get it.

88
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,650
不过也许就有另外一种风格
But maybe there is another way of doing it.

89
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:55,760
当每个部件都工作出色时,你能感到这种乐趣
就像这个变速箱一样
There's a sort of joy in things that simply 
work really well, like this gearbox.

90
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,250
这就像是狙击枪上的二阶式扳机
It's sort of like a two-stage 
trigger on a sniping rifle -

91
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,650
你先用一半的弹药来预载,然后再切换
you can preload it with half a ball...
and then change.

92
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,800
我非常满意
It's very satisfying.

93
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:12,740
也许对细节的追求能使得它有自己的一番天地,我们走着瞧
Maybe really anal attention to detail 
will have a charm of its own. Let's see.

94
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:17,830
詹姆斯和理查德可以爱怎么说怎么说,不过事实是不变的
James and Richard can make as many arguments 
as they want, but the fact is this.

95
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,320
他们俩开的就像是维珍可乐
(注:类似中国的"非常可乐")
They're driving about in Virgin Cola.

96
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,280
那些都是山寨的. 这个才是实在货
It's not the real thing. This is the real thing.

97
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,850
兰博基尼用缪拉开创了超跑天地
Lamborghini invented the supercar with the Miura,

98
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:32,890
缪拉是史上首辆中置引擎的速度梦想机器
the world's first mid-engine speed and dream machine.

99
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,060
确实,这辆车是这三辆里面最贵的
I mean, yes, this is the most expensive car here.

100
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,770
它要25万英镑,不过谁会管它的售价呢?
这是辆梦中坐骑
A quarter of a million pounds.
But who cares? It's a dream car.

101
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:45,280
你才不会梦想着去费雷城或是去布雷德灵顿(英国城市)
你会梦想着去大溪地度假
You don't dream about going to Filey or Bridlington.
You dream about going to Tahiti.

102
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,490
话说回来,大溪地相当差劲. 我去了一次
Actually, Tahiti's terrible. I went there once.

103
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,870
那里全都是对着海豚发呆的美国佬
It was full of Americans looking at dolphins.

104
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:59,110
半小时后,有人告诉我们要去加油
'Half an hour later, we were told to
brim the tanks in our cars

105
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:03,490
并仔细听好我们即将接受的挑战
'and pay careful attention to the
challenge we were about to receive.'

106
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:08,830
"你们现在要看看哪辆车极速最快"
"You will now see which of 
your cars can achieve the highest speed."

107
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,400
多简单,一定是我的了
That'll be mine. It's as simple as that.

108
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,800
它的极速最高
It's the fastest.

109
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,090
"不过这和你们的车的极速无关."
"How fast your car can go is not relevant."

110
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,680
"而和你们敢开多快有关"
"It's how fast you dare drive it."

111
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,230
这个挑战的地点是纳多测试赛道
'The location for this challenge 
was the Nardo test track,

112
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:30,240
一个全长8英里的柏油圆形跑道
它的面积非常大,从太空都能清楚地看的见
'a banked 8-mile circle of tarmac
so vast it can be seen clearly from space.

113
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:37,380
没有车能够在这里达到理论极速
因为整条赛道是个无尽的弯道
'No car can achieve its true top speed here
because it's one endless corner.

114
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:43,400
不过能让车接近于它的理论极速的地方
除了这里,世界上也只有两三个了
'But it is one of only two or three
places in the world where they can get close.

115
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,150
兰博基尼和迈凯轮都派出了技术人员
'Lamborghini and McLaren had
both sent technicians to make sure their cars,

116
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:56,840
来确保跑车,尤其是轮胎,能够经受住长期高速转弯的热量
'and especially the tyres, could handle 
the vast heat of constant high-speed cornering.

117
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,830
不过对于理查德和他莱切斯特的跑车来说..
'But as for Richard and his car from Leicester...'

118
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,750
-Noble在这里没有保修厂吗?  -保修厂,没有
Do Noble not have a workshop here?
Not a workshop, no.

119
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,950
如果我们在马洛里赛道上做的话,他们能送个工程师来吧!
(马洛里赛道位于Noble总部的莱斯特郡)
I suppose if we were doing this
at Mallory Park, they'd send Geoff over(!)

120
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:12,480
我开过他,没问题. 四个轮胎都在
I've done it. It's all right.
All four tyres are the same makes.

121
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,550
轮胎也有气
That there's air in 'em.

122
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,640
詹姆斯和我感觉信心满满
'James and I were feeling fairly confident...

123
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,790
不过当我们和一位兰博基尼试车手,马克思・凡度里,聊天时
'until we started chatting to 
a man called Max Venturi,

124
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,280
我们的自信消失了
'who is one of Lambo's test drivers.'

125
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,780
我们在这里做很多赛道测试,不过不经常测试极速
We do a lot of testing here but
we don't do too much the top speed,

126
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,200
因为赛道很颠
because it is very bumpy.

127
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,130
你都能从一条车道弹跳到另一条车道上去
You...you could jump from one lane to the other lane,

128
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:39,300
听起来不太妙啊
so is... That sounds bad.

129
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,180
而且今天风很大
And also, today, it is windy,

130
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:46,420
-你们也要小心风  
-那么我们需要抢风调向么(帆船用语)?
so you need to take care about the wind, as well.
What, do we need to tack(?)

131
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,570
因为速度表不是完全准确
'Because speedometers are never absolutely accurate,

132
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:55,230
制片人在我们的车上装配了高科技遥感设备
'the producers fitted each
of our cars with hi-tech telemetry

133
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,070
所以他们会测出我们的速度
'so they could see how fast we were really going.

134
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:03,050
之后我们上了赛道,开了几圈暖胎圈
'And then we were sent on to
the track for a sighting lap.'

135
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,280
在这里我有最多的本钱能输掉
I have the most to lose here.

136
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,900
理论上我的车极速最高 - 225英里每小时 
(约为360公里每小时)
My car is the fastest - top speed 225mph.

137
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:21,680
杰里米的兰博极速217, (约为349公里每小时)
詹姆斯的迈凯轮极速是205. (约为330公里每小时)
Jeremy's Lambo - 217, James's McLaren 205mph,

138
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,410
迈凯轮已经慢到了散步的速度
or to put it another way, a walking pace.

139
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:30,030
我的引擎有691匹马力
Now, I have 691 brake horsepower at my disposal.

140
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,620
比詹姆斯的足足多了100匹
That's almost 100 more than James has.

141
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,540
而且我的是纯纯正正的马力
And it's proper horsepower.

142
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,520
真正的贵族纯种
Blue-blooded, real horsepower.

143
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,650
托尾气排放新规的福
Thanks to emission regulations,

144
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:44,140
这辆车的V12引擎可能是世界上最后的一台了
this is probably the last V12 engine
that will ever be made.

145
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,150
从现在开始,引擎一律要更小,并要加装涡轮增压
From now on, they'll have to be
smaller and turbo charged,

146
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,630
就像Noble的和迈凯轮的一样
like they are in the Noble and the McLaren.

147
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,820
的确,我的引擎最小,只是台3.8升V8引擎
Yes, my engine is the smallest. It's a 3.8-litre V8,

148
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:59,830
不过它的输出比量最大,在所有这三台引擎中
but it has the highest specific output,
that is, of all the engines here,

149
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,350
每升排气量,它能产出最多的马力值
it produces the most BHP per litre,

150
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:05,670
因为这台引擎是被沃金的工程师们精心调教出的
because it's been intelligently
designed by engineers in Woking,

151
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:10,030
而不是拼凑在一起为了取悦蛮人
not just put together to impress yahoos.

152
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,910
那两个人不断地说这台引擎来自于沃尔沃XC90
Those two keep banging on about,
"This has got the engine out of a Volvo XC90."

153
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:19,720
是,没错,不过不要忘了,引擎制造商是雅马哈
Yes, well, OK, but let's not forget, Yamaha make it,

154
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,600
雅马哈曾经造过许多卓越的摩托车引擎
and they produce some pretty 
amazing motorcycle engines,

155
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,690
之后Noble又装了两个涡轮,结果就是它能产出650匹马力
and Noble have then strapped
two turbos to it, so it makes 650 brake horsepower.

156
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,620
话是那么说,马力是可变的
I say that, but I can change that.

157
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:35,400
按下这个按钮,我可以使用"公路模式"的450匹马力
或是"赛道模式"的550匹马力
With this button down here, 
I can have 450 for road, 550 for track,

158
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,350
或者"狂飙模式"的650匹. 
今天我就用它完完整整的650匹马力吧
or 650 for race. 
I'm going to have the full 650, I think, today.

159
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:43,470
我还是对小矮个儿敢做这个测试感到由衷的敬佩的
I do have quite a lot of respect for
the Midget doing this, because...

160
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:48,360
因为上一次他在赛道上挑战极速时,情况不太妙
(第9季第1集理查德驾驶喷气赛车爆胎重伤)
Well, the last time he tried to go fast 
on a test track, it didn't go well.

161
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,360
暖胎圈结束
With the sighting lap over,

162
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,860
我们被告知拉开距离,放手去开
we were told to put some distance
between ourselves and go for it.

163
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,230
转到最外线
I'm moving up into the outside lane.

164
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,010
时速250公里
It's 250kph.

165
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,680
现在我们在第6档上
Now we're in 6th speed...

166
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,210
小爬坡
Moving up a little bit...

167
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,250
确实有点振动,感觉不爽
It does feel a bit wobbly. I don't like it.

168
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,620
270...

169
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,810
亲娘啊,这赛道表面太差劲了!
My God, this surface is shocking!

170
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:32,780
风来了! 振动感来了!
There's the wind! There's the wobble!

171
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,260
车身弹跳!
There's the jump!

172
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,690
天啊!!
Ooh, God!

173
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:41,490
现在是280公里每小时,车身晃动得厉害了. 290..
See, that is 280, 
and it's really starting to weave now. 290...

174
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,250
兰博基尼试车手马克思警告我们说
'Max from Lamborghini had warned all of us

175
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:48,170
开过时速300公里太危险了
'that it would be too dangerous
to exceed 300km per hour.

176
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,150
不过我们都忽略了这个警告
'And all of us chose to ignore him.'

177
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,700
我的脚正死死地踩着
My foot is hard down now.

178
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,090
时速300公里..天啊!!
300 and... Oh, crikey! Moses.

179
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,950
要松下油门喘口气了. 吓了一大跳
I'd a lift there. Bit of a panic.

180
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:08,910
速度表上说时速300公里,我能感受到车身弹跳
300km per hour indicated.
I can feel the car jumping.

181
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,300
在加速! 加速!
Buffeting! Buffeting!

182
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,930
要吓人了..哇哦!!
There's a scare? Whoa-ho-ho!

183
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,650
314...316...

184
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,200
我的每一条神经都想让我松油门!
And every fibre of my being wants me to lift off!

185
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,840
我那没死去的亲娘呀!!
Oh, God Almighty!

186
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,810
天知道那些轮胎过的是怎样的苦日子
God knows what those tyres are going through.

187
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,370
这太催眠了
God, it's hypnotic.

188
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,230
不要看白线,不要看白线
Don't look at the line,
don't look at the line.

189
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,180
加油!
Come on!

190
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,100
再快10公里吧!! 求你啦!
Please, just another ten!

191
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,360
时速326!
326 indicated!

192
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,680
327!
327 indicated.

193
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,650
时速329!! 加油! 330!
329 indicated! Come on - 330!

194
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,430
331.

195
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,650
加油啊,让我比330再快一点吧!!
Come on, give me a bit more than 330!

196
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,160
再快一点!!
Just give me a bit more!

197
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,050
快一点!!
A bit more!

198
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,870
太他娘的快啦!!
This is BLEEP quick!

199
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,020
我爽够了
I'm backing out of this.

200
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,780
这太..
That is...

201
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,560
太TM吓人了..
..pretty bloody alarming.

202
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:27,710
极速测试结束,现在要看看我们三个人
'With the test over, 
it was now time to find out which one of us

203
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,440
谁的时速最高.. 
'had the biggest testes.'

204
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,600
-你的车的理论极速是时速225英里  -没错
The top speed of your car is 225mph.
Yes.

205
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,660
你开到了时速204.8英里
You achieved 204.8.

206
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,210
-你手里是谁的成绩?  -这是詹姆斯的成绩
-詹姆斯的?  -没错
Who have you got?
I've got James's. James's? Yes.

207
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:46,750
极速最慢的一辆车. 时速二百..
In the slowest car, in the slowest car. 
200... Oh!

208
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,730
零一点六英里
..and 1.6.

209
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:54,270
兰博基尼的极速是217英里每小时
217mph IS the top speed of the Lamborghini.

210
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,670
你开到了..
You did it at

211
00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:02,590
204.3

212
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:19,690
好的,我们一会儿继续影片
Right, we will, of course be picking
that up again later on.

213
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:24,600
我只想说,只差了时速半英里? 我们俩只差那么多
Can I just say, half a mile an hour? That's all 
there was in it between you and me. Yeah.

214
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,270
-如果我把油门再踩得死一点..  -是啊,不过你还是输了!
If I'd just kept my foot down...
Yeah. But you lost!

215
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:35,210
-慢着,我觉得你们俩都输了  -你什么意思?
Hold on a minute. Hold on. I think you'll find 
you both lost. How did you work that out?

216
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:39,480
我的实际速度和我的理论极速最接近
Because I got closest to
the theoretical top speed of my car,

217
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,470
-所以我的胆子最大  -搞什么!
and therefore I have the biggest testes. No!

218
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:45,900
挑战内容是谁能开得最快,而我开得最快
The challenge was to see who could
drive the fastest, and I did.

219
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:50,570
之后我们重新加油来测算谁的耗油量最低
Then we refilled the cars, we brimmed them, 
to see which had used the least fuel doing it,

220
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:54,800
想猜猜吗? 兰博的油耗是每加仑7英里 (百公里33升)
and guess what?! Well, the Lambo did 7mpg,

221
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,550
迈凯轮每加仑8英里, (百公里29升)
而Noble是每加仑9英里! (百公里26升)
the McLaren did 8mpg and the Noble did 9!

222
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:01,390
Noble再下一城!
So the Noble wins AGAIN! I know!

223
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,760
总结一下比赛成果,目前两项挑战
Let's just...just to work out where we are,
so that's two challenges so far,

224
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,640
Noble两战全胜,而兰博..
two wins for the Noble, and for the Lambo...

225
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,610
-我们看看..  -别看了,我们做新闻吧
Now, let's see. Let's not see.
Let's do the news. All right.

226
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:21,000
在新闻之前,观看了我们圣诞特辑的观众们
Actually, before that, those of you
who saw our Christmas special

227
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,780
可能会记得我们把三辆车留在了喜马拉雅山脉的三个底座上
will remember we left our three cars
on plinths high in the Himalayas

228
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,430
就在中印公路之间
on a road between China and India,

229
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:31,930
意图是为在这两个经济大国间穿行的人们
so that people passing between these
two great economic superpowers

230
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:35,010
能够永远铭记大不列颠的荣耀
would forevermore be
reminded of Great Britain.

231
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,530
不幸的是
Well, unfortunately,

232
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:41,120
我们建的三个底座的地方
it turns out that the plinths were built on

233
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,100
是一个古代陵墓
an ancient burial ground

234
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,720
而且有着巨大的宗教价值
with deep religious significance,

235
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,110
所以有位老兄马上让我们把底座拆了下来
so a man came and told us
to take them down immediately.

236
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,800
-于是我们照做了  -那三辆车现在在哪里?
Yeah. So we did. Where are the cars now?

237
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,860
-不在喜马拉雅  -那它们在那儿?
They're not in the Himalayas. But where are they?

238
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:59,570
-在汉普郡  -真的啊?
-没错,保留在那里了. 不管怎样,让我们做新闻吧
Hampshire. Really? 
Yes. That's where it is. Anyway, the news.

239
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:07,380
这周的报纸报道,有位老兄驾驶理论考试挂了92次
There was a man in the papers this week who 
has failed his driving theory test 92 times.

240
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:13,270
-92次?!   -我不想太粗鲁,不过这仁兄没比白痴强哪儿去吧
92?! I don't want to be rude, but he must be an idiot...

241
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:19,190
-话虽然那么说,你见过理论考试吗?
-我考驾照的时候不需要考理论
Interestingly, you say that. Have you seen 
the theory test? I didn't have to do one.

242
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:23,440
这里有人参加过驾驶理论考试吗? 你参加过?
Has anyone here seen the theory test? 
Anybody? Yeah. You have?

243
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,930
我们这辈人基本都不需要理论考试
Because most people of our age haven't,

244
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:30,280
在我看来,这些理论考试题都和"驾驶"没什么关系
and none of the questions have anything to do - 
as far as I can work out - with driving.

245
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,230
举个例子,试着回答这个问题
Can I give you some examples? You can answer this.

246
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,580
"一个老年人.."
"An elderly person...

247
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:41,920
"一个老年人的能力可能被影响,因为他们无法____?"
"An elderly person's ability could be affected 
because they may be unable to...?"

248
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,770
-无法嚼动太妃糖.  -不对
Eat toffees. No.

249
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,830
无法勃起
Get an erection.

250
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,080
无法穿牛仔裤
Wear jeans!

251
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,430
玩去. "在晚上最安全的停车位是哪里?"
Funny(!) "Where's the safest place
to park your vehicle at night?"

252
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,700
警察局
In a police station.

253
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,710
我们有这个照片,请把它打在屏幕上
Right, we've got a picture here.
Bring up this picture. Right.

254
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,960
这是道真实的考题,是吧?
This is a real question, OK?

255
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:09,250
前方学校 保持道路畅通

256
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,710
"在这个标志前请不要停车"
"You must not stop on these road markings

257
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,750
"因为你可能会堵塞_____的道路?"
"because you may obstruct...what?"

258
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,400
-堵塞飞机起降么?!  -不开玩笑,这是道真正的问题
Landing aircraft(!) 
I mean, seriously, that is a question.

259
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,800
-这种问题他居然都能挂掉92次 
-这些都跟开车没关系的啊!
He's managed to fail 92 times on that one. 
Those are not questions to pass your driving...

260
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,370
有没有问题说,比如说,你会不会开车?
Do any of them say, for instance, can you drive a car?

261
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:27,500
我看的这本书是青少年驾驶教程
I'm in the book now. This is what you buy 
your teenage child when they're learning to drive.

262
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:31,880
"在一起事故中,一名儿童停止了呼吸"
"At an incident, a small child is not breathing.

263
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:37,010
"要恢复正常呼吸,你需要______地向他嘴里吹气
A.急剧地 B.柔和地"
"To restore normal breathing, you should breathe 
into their mouth, A sharply, B gently,

264
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,720
"C.大量地 D.温和地"
"C heavily, D tenderly?"

265
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,390
才不会是"温和地"!!
It doesn't say "tenderly"!

266
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:45,260
D那个选项是我瞎编的,不过这都跟开车没关系!
驾照考试的这一套说得够多了
I made "tenderly" up. Nothing to do with driving!
That's enough driving test rubbish.

267
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,350
必须要继续节目了,否则在这侃大山能侃上一整天
We'll have to move it on, or we'll be here all day.

268
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:51,000
重回到车的话题上. 话说阿尔法罗密欧
Let's talk about cars again,
because the mighty Alfa Romeo,

269
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,750
原来上上下下的各种车款
they are reduced now, to a full range of cars,

270
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,610
-现在减产到了只剩下两款. 只有两款车
-真的? 那剩下什么了, Mito和什么..?
they make two. Two cars.
Really? What, the Mito and...

271
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,760
-Mito和Giulietta  -那么159已经停产了吗?
The Giulietta and the Mito.
They don't make the 159 any more?

272
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,070
没有了,只有两款阿尔法罗密欧在产
No, two Alfa Romeos on the market,

273
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,470
不过情况要改变了,因为他们刚刚发布了这一款4C
but that's about to change as they
have just announced this, the 4C.

274
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,150
您看! 的确,它很小,轻量化的跑车
I know. It's tiny, it's a small,
lightweight sports car.

275
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,150
车重很轻,有碳纤维和其它各种高科技玩意儿
Very lightweight. Carbon fibre,
all sorts of clever technical stuff.

276
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,470
中置引擎. 它的引擎只有1.75升,不过有涡轮增压
Mid-engined, it's only a 1750CC engine, 
but it's turbo charged,

277
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,070
由于车轻,它肯定跑得不慢. 造型更是无限华美
so it will be quick, because it's so light. 
It looks fantastic!

278
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,070
这车做错了. 阿尔法罗密欧应该制造的车
It's wrong, is what it is.
What Alfa Romeo should make

279
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,470
应该是小敞篷单排跑车
is a small convertible two-seater,

280
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,110
前置引擎,后轮驱动
engine at the front, rear-wheel drive.

281
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,590
-名字应该叫做.. -Spider? (阿尔法经典车名)
-Spider这名字就很不错
They could call it, I don't know, the...
Spider? Spider's a great name.

282
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,430
也许他们可以找来达斯汀・霍夫曼在电影里驾驶一辆
And maybe they could get Dustin
Hoffman to appear in a film with it,

283
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,500
来提高它的知名度
to etch it into the world's consciousness.

284
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,550
阿尔法也许可以留存在记忆中
They could, they could live in the past.

285
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,870
不过他们选择了跟随现代的脚步并造出了这个
Or they could make something modern and
forward-looking, like that. No, rubbish!

286
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,860
当阿尔法罗密欧造出老Spider的时候
What if you two had been at Alfa Romeo when

287
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,830
如果你们俩在阿尔法能是什么样?
they came up with the original Spider?

288
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,470
"太差劲了,前面的马呢?"
"That's no good! Where's the horse in front of it?

289
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,310
-"这不是木质的,质量肯定不行"  
-这才不是跟时代接轨,这是残次品
"It's not wood. That'll never work."
It's not modern. It won't work.

290
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,750
把它撤下去,因为我有更有兴趣的新闻
Make it go away. I've got something
more important to talk about.

291
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,990
新款玛莎拉蒂上市了. 这是新款的玛莎拉蒂4x4越野车,是吧?
A new Maserati. Really(?) OK.
This is the new Maserati 4x4, OK?

292
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,030
它看上去很漂亮,不过有些事情很奇怪
I think it looks fantastic but there
are some odd things about it.

293
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:12,190
玛莎拉蒂声称,与其它大4x4越野车不同的是
玛莎拉蒂越野车有一种奢华的气氛
Maserati say that, unlike any other
big 4x4, it has a luxury atmosphere.

294
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,310
因为每次我坐进路虎的驾驶舱里时,我总会想
Cos every time I get in a Range Rover, 
I always think, "Oh, no!

295
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,990
"哦,不! 我是不是进了牛棚里了?!"
"I've accidentally got into a cowshed."

296
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,750
玛莎拉蒂还说
And then they say,

297
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,310
"没有越野车具有运动感"
"There are no off-roaders that give a sporty feel."

298
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,910
-保时捷卡宴? 梅赛德斯ML63?  -宝马X5?
What about the Porsche Cayenne?
Or the Mercedes ML63? BMW X5?

299
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,910
那些都有运动感啊
All of those?

300
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,360
玛莎拉蒂可能就是那种公司
I think Maserati... they're the sort of company

301
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,790
他们会说, "我们发明出了一种新表"
that go, "We've invented a new type of watch.

302
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,910
"这种表的特别之处就是你可以把它戴在手腕上!"
"What makes it really good is,
you can wear it on your wrist!"

303
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,460
这就麻烦了,因为必须要有勇士跟他们说
This is quite awkward, because somebody'll have

304
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,990
"嘿,玛莎拉蒂,有人已经做过了!"
to tell them, "Hey, Maserati, it's been done!"

305
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,940
我特别钟爱的一点是
What I love about this, though, is it's

306
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,870
它的名字叫"库班"
继承着玛莎拉蒂的优良传统
called the Kubang, which, being a Maserati,

307
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,510
这名字一定是保修期过期时车会发出的声音!
is the noise it'll make
the day the warranty runs out!

308
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:59,590
我们收到了一位想上电视的老兄的新闻稿
We received a press release from someone who wanted to
get their name on the television, I've always said.

309
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,590
他说当我们感冒的时候,我们的驾驶水平降低
Now, they say that the standard of your driving
gets worse if you're suffering from a cold.

310
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:11,750
问题是,他还说吃感冒药也不行
The thing is, they go on to say that
it's no good taking a cold remedy,

311
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:18,430
因为警察叔叔说吃感冒药后驾车
就等同于服用可卡因后驾车一样
because the police say that's the same as driving
while under the influence of cocaine.

312
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,030
可卡因和板蓝根是两种完全不同的东西
I mean, cocaine and Day Nurse
are different products entirely.

313
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,350
-价格也完全不一样  -完全不同
They're in a different price bracket. 
Entirely different.

314
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,840
想说这个的原因是,是从什么时候开始
I bring all this up, OK, because when did it happen 
that somebody decided that driving

315
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,350
有人说驾驶变得相当复杂,以至于你不能边开车边做事?
was so unbelievably hard, you can't
do it while doing something else?

316
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,750
比如收听肯・布鲁斯的音乐测验节目,或是打手机
Like listening to Ken Bruce's pop master, 
or talking on the phone.

317
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,750
说实话,我想不出什么事我不能一边开车一边做
Honestly, I can't think of anything
that I couldn't do while driving...

318
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,190
除了阅读四开大报纸
apart from reading a broadsheet newspaper.

319
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,790
-读报纸估计不行  -锯木头?
I wouldn't be able to do that. Sawing a piece of wood.

320
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,430
-我可以啊 -你需要..
不不不,你把木头放在两腿之间
I could do that. You'd... No, no,
you put it between your legs.

321
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,700
你还可以踩踏板,并一边锯木头
You can still operate the pedals. You could saw.

322
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,950
缝纽扣? 你需要两只手..
It's like sewing on a button. You need both hands...

323
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,950
我没问题.
-你绝对不行!  -没问题!!
I could do that. You could not! I could!

324
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,910
你知道你不能用锤子来缝按钮吧?!
我知道怎么缝东西
You know you can't sew on a button
with a hammer? I know how to sew.

325
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,430
说到这儿了,你最近听没听说那个事情
While we're on the subject, 
did you see that case recently...

326
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,750
警察在高速上拦住了一位女士,因为她一边开车..
a woman who was stopped by the police after they
caught her driving down a motorway while...

327
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,080
..一边"自娱自乐"
causing herself to have pleasure.

328
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,270
我打赌你不能在睡袋里开车
I bet you can't drive in a sleeping bag.

329
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,590
不对,也不一定
Actually, I'm not sure.

330
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,920
我收回. 我觉得你也能在睡袋里开车
I'm going to take that back. 
I think you could drive in a sleeping bag.

331
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,750
你不能在睡袋里开车!
-我相信我没问题  -不行!!
You couldn't drive in a sleeping bag.
I bet I could. Can't!

332
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,470
-在睡袋里开车绝对是小事一桩  -没错,就那样
I bet I could drive in a sleeping bag. 
Right, you're on!

333
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,750
这周的什么时候,下一集节目之前,我把你带到赛道上
Some time this week, before next week's show, 
I'll take you on round the track.

334
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,460
你罩在一个正常的睡袋里,双臂缩进去
You drive in a proper cocoon sleeping bag... Yeah...

335
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:49,150
我来缝一件衬衫上的纽扣,我们俩赛车
and race me, and I'll sew a button on my shirt.

336
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,030
让我猜猜,我是不是要边开车也边"自娱自乐"一下啊?
Let me guess... I've got to drive whilst 
performing an act on myself.

337
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,870
-比赛会很短!  -我们不带你玩了
No. It'd be a short race! We'll leave you out of it.

338
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,510
50码冲刺赛成不成?
Can we make it a 50-yard sprint?!

339
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,030
好的,新闻部分结束,回到影片中去
Right, that is the end of the news,
so let's get back to the action.

340
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,150
如果有贵人多忘事,今天晚上
Tonight, for those of you with very short memories,

341
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,870
我们试着回答一个重要的问题
we are trying to answer an important question...

342
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,070
如果你不想要法拉利458,哪一个是最棒的中置引擎超跑?
which is the best mid-engined supercar
if you don't want a Ferrari 458?

343
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,550
詹姆斯认为是迈凯轮MP4-12C
James says it's the McLaren MP4...12C.

344
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,590
我觉得是兰博基尼Aventador
I say it's the Lamborghini Aventador,

345
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,710
理查德说是Noble M600
and Richard says it's the Noble M600.

346
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,390
目前为止,证明了我的选择是正确的
Yes, and so far, I'm being proved right.

347
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,710
我的极速最快,而且最省油
It achieved the highest top speed
and is the most economical.

348
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,150
不过这些测验结束之后
But having tested those sort of things,

349
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:42,150
制片人让我们离开赛道,向北驶往罗马
we were then told to leave the test
track and drive north to Rome.

350
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,950
三辆超跑,有爱的天气,驾车穿越意大利
So, three supercars, 
lovely weather, drive across Italy,

351
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,440
这能出什么茬子?
what could possibly go wrong(?)

352
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,990
当然,新的一天开始时,哈蒙德显得牛X轰轰..
'Certainly, as the day began, the
rather smug Hammond was very happy,

353
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,870
并开始"自娱自乐"..
'making up his own little games.'

354
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,710
我想来感受一下涡轮的声音,这非常上瘾
I'm going to make some more turbo noise. 
It is addictive.

355
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,880
踩下油门,然后松油门
Put the foot down and then lift off. Ooh!

356
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,550
涡轮噪音是给小孩儿玩的,你知道吧?
Turbo noises are sort of for children. 
You do know that?

357
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:15,790
现在我在你旁边开过,并给你个涡轮声. 把车窗摇下来..
Right, I'm going to come alongside and give
you a turbo noise. Drop your window. God...

358
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,580
三, 二, 一
Three, two, one.

359
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,560
这就像是个六岁孩子刚学会纸牌魔术时的那种满足
This is like indulging a six-year-old
child who's learned a simple card trick.

360
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,400
大事不好!
Oh, BLEEP!

361
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,150
很是羞愧,不过我貌似有离合器或是变速箱问题
I hate to say this, but I believe
I have clutch or gearbox issues.

362
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,000
啊呀呀..
Oh, dear.

363
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,100
我不太能理解
I can't understand it myself, cos you know

364
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,350
因为当你看到"莱切斯特制造"这行字时
when you see the legend "made in Leicester"...

365
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,910
-就像是可靠性和质量的代名词  -完全没错
It's a byword for reliability and quality. Absolutely.

366
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,830
莱切斯特还做什么来着?
So what are the other things 
that are made in Leicester?

367
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,200
-莱切斯特奶酪?  -附近还有猪肉馅饼卖吧?
Leicestershire cheese?
They make pork pies nearby, don't they?

368
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,550
猪肉馅饼从来都是很可靠的
Yeah. Pork pies are always reliable(!)

369
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,000
你有没有试过反复踩离合器?
Have you tried pumping the clutch, to see if...?

370
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,430
没有,因为连接系统可能也出问题了
Well, no, because the linkage is to cock as well.

371
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,750
很明显,Noble现在寸步难行
'Clearly, the Noble wasn't going anywhere.'

372
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,110
不好意思,让我想想
Let me just think a minute. Sorry.

373
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,830
当我的车出问题的时候
When something goes wrong with my car,

374
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,350
-哈蒙德同学总会..  -帮助你?
Richard Hammond always... helps you.

375
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,910
不,正好相反,他会上他的车溜之大吉
No, the opposite of that. 
No, he just gets in his car and drives off.

376
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,280
-没错,我们撤吧  -回见了
You're right. Yes. Let's do that.
Goodbye. Goodbye.

377
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,830
我们把哈蒙德丢在了罗马200英里之外的路边
'We were leaving Hammond 200 miles away from Rome,

378
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,150
这让我们感觉挺羞愧
'and that made us feel quite sorry for him.'

379
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,510
两个月以来,他一直盼着驾驶Noble跑车穿越意大利
For two months, he's been looking
forward to driving his Noble

380
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,400
而现在他只开了30英里!
right across Italy, and he's only gone 30 miles!

381
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,320
行驶里程逐渐增加的同时,我们也更了解自己的座驾了
'As our cars ate up the miles, 
we got to know them better.'

382
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,070
天呐,这辆车真是太出色了,真的
Bloody hell, it's good, this. It really is good.

383
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,270
非常的伶俐,也很反应灵敏
It's very clever. It's active, this car.

384
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,510
它没有那种大金属防滚架那种东西
It doesn't have big metal anti-roll bars, 
or anything like that.

385
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,750
整车都被它的智脑控制,芯片能够算出每个车轮的职责
Everything is controlled by its brain.
It works out what each wheel is doing.

386
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,630
在你过弯时,每个车轮都能够独立制动
It can even brake an individual wheel as you corner.

387
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,390
以前超跑非常非常难驾驶
In the olden days, 
supercars were very, very hard to drive,

388
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,670
而最难驾驶的无疑就是大号的兰博了
and the hardest of them all were the big Lambos.

389
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:23,550
要想在昆塔奇或是鬼怪里换挡,你需要两只手一起换
Changing gear in a Countach or a Diablo, 
you needed two hands.

390
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:27,390
不过这辆车的感觉就和大众高尔夫一样.
This, though, it feels like a Golf.
I mean, I'm doing, what,

391
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,990
现在我开到时速80英里,车内完全安静
80mph now, and it's almost completely silent.

392
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,950
我能看到前面,也差不多能看到后面
I can see where I'm going.
I can see roughly where I've been.

393
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,310
很值得一提的是
I think it's important to stress at this point,

394
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,110
这辆车的每一个部件都是全新的
every single thing about this car is new.

395
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,000
车身,内饰,引擎,悬架.. 所有都是
Body, interior, engine, suspension. Everything.

396
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,680
整车都在透露着"新"的气息,而且这是能够感受到的
It's brand new, and it feels it.

397
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,990
与此同时,久等了两个半小时之后
'Meanwhile, after a two-and-a-half-hour wait,

398
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,440
来拯救我的盔甲骑士救兵赶到了
'my knight in shining armour finally arrived.'

399
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,470
你好!
Hi!

400
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,750
我说..
Hi...

401
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,830
就是它了
This is the car.

402
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,200
你说句话吧..
Please talk to me.

403
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:25,960
说个你好也行啊,或者能看见我也行啊..
Please just say hello,
or just... Or see me, even.

404
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,550
马上将驶入一条长长的隧道
Ah, now, there's a big tunnel coming up here.

405
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,680
这时候最不应该干的事就是
The irresponsible thing to do would be to

406
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,790
调整到赛道模式
turn the power train into the track mode

407
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:41,310
并不必要地减档. 三,二,一,洒家来也!
and change down unnecessarily. Three, two, one, go!

408
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,080
哦~~~! 惊为天人!!
Oh, what a sound!

409
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:59,720
詹姆斯的车声音相当棒,不过我的车在喷火!
'James's car made a great
noise, but mine was making fire!'

410
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,040
很遗憾哈蒙德不能在这里一起欣赏
It's a shame Hammond isn't here to enjoy the moment.

411
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,920
是吧..
Right...

412
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,280
他需要说那么多话么?
Does he need that many words?

413
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,280
亲娘啊..
Oh, God.

414
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,270
他的手机底部是一条电线
The thing coming off the bottom
of his phone is actually a wire...

415
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,040
连到他的夹克里面,因为那里面全部都是电池
into his jacket, and then that's ALL batteries.

416
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,670
这是我的搭讪表情
That's my open communicative face.

417
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,150
回到六档! 哈哈!!
Oh, back to six! Ha-ha!

418
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:13,550
我们的日子变得越来越幸福美满
'Our day, meanwhile, 
was just getting better and better.'

419
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,880
-这景色真不赖啊!  -确实不可思议!!
That's not a bad view, is it? Marvellous.

420
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:27,110
才意识到,我正驾驶一辆超级跑车穿越意大利
It's just suddenly hit me, 
that I'm driving across Italy in a supercar,

421
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,120
而且我还能看到另一辆超级跑车穿越意大利
and I've got another one to look at!

422
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:36,180
很久,很久之后..

423
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,920
-晚上好!  -晚上好!
Buona sera! Buona sera!

424
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,270
没错..不知道他说啥
Oh, yeah... No idea.

425
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,910
-说意大利语吗?  -不会..
Parlate Italiano? No.

426
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,990
-英语?  -不会!
-法语?  -不会!
English? No! French? No.

427
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,870
不好,他要打手机..不好..
Oh, no, he's going on the phone.
Oh, no. Oh, no...

428
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,230
又完活一个
Well, that's that, then.

429
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,470
没有最糟,只有更糟..
'Still, could be worse... '

430
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,280
娘的
Oh, dear.

431
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,630
准备盯着鞋看吧
Prepare to look at shoes.

432
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,040
这是我对付欧洲警察的专用表情
This is my special face,
reserved for continental policemen.

433
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,590
离罗马只剩四个小时的路程了
Still, it is under four hours to Rome. Just.

434
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,000
这傻X说啥呢?

435
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,710
拦下我们的原因是
今天是意大利的节假日
The only problem for them is
because today is holiday in Italy.

436
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,630
有趣的是
警察唯一的忧虑是我们在星期日竟然还工作
Interestingly, their only real concern is
that we appear to be working on a Sunday.

437
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,710
因此我们需要个许可证
We need a permit for that.

438
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,240
由此不难看出为啥意大利都快破产了
That's why Italy's nearly bankrupt.

439
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,590
最终,警察们强制我们停止工作
'Eventually, they told us we had to stop working,

440
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,840
于是我们进入罗马享受了一顿可口的晚宴
'so we went into Rome for a lovely dinner.'

441
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,840
有人放屁了
Somebody's farted.

442
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,910
第二天,在罗马城郊的一间修车行里
'The next day, in a workshop in the outskirts of Rome,

443
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,390
我发现了Noble到底出了什么问题
'I found out just what had gone wrong with my Noble.'

444
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:32,470
这是离合器..这是离合器片
This is the clutch assembly... and
this is the plate and, yeah,

445
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,350
这就是出问题的部件了
that's pretty clearly the component that failed.

446
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,550
只要这个断了,那个就下来了. 它本不该断落的
Once that broke, that came away,
which is not supposed to happen.

447
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,350
不过这个部件好换. Noble虽然不造这种东西
The thing is, this is easily replaceable. 
Noble don't make these.

448
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,270
离合器只是Noble买来组装的,
They're bought in... it's a clutch...
but the problem now is,

449
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,390
问题是,由于离合器会在里面呼呼地转
because that was whizzing around inside here,

450
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,820
轴承啊什么的肯定都有损坏
that's damaged bearings and shafts 
and all sorts of things.

451
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,240
看看它有没有造成变速箱损坏
What's it done to the gearbox?

452
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:59,230
詹姆斯和我决定,能帮助哈蒙德最有效的办法是去吃午餐
'James and I decided the best way we
could help Hammond was to go for lunch,

453
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:03,350
既然是个星期一,我们可以做点工作喽
'and since it was a Monday and we
were allowed to do a bit of work,

454
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:08,190
我们要比赛谁先到餐厅
看看哪辆车在城市交通中更优秀
'we thought we'd find out which of our cars was
best in traffic by racing to the restaurant.

455
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,390
后到的付账!
'Last one there would pay the bill!'

456
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,080
比赛开始!
Right, let the race begin.

457
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:20,230
马上这就给兰博带来优势,因为兰博有卫星导航
'Immediately, it was advantage Lambo,
because the Aventador has sat-nav... '

458
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,470
-"路线正在计划中"  -谢了
'Your route is being calculated.' Thank you.

459
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,280
不过在迈凯轮里,卫星导航是个没装的选装配件
'..Whereas, on the McLaren, it's an
option... that hadn't been fitted.'

460
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,750
该死
Bollocks!

461
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,190
我一会儿再看
I'll come back to that.

462
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,350
不过,我的问题也不少
'However, I did have some issues.'

463
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,270
首先是它的宽度
The first problem is width.

464
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,670
它比路虎还要宽5厘米
It's five centimetres wider than a Range Rover.

465
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:50,270
它差不多和伦敦公交车一样宽
It's very nearly as wide, in fact, as a London bus,

466
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:54,990
不过最大的问题是它的变速箱
but the biggest problem of them all is the gearbox.

467
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,550
拨片变速箱的赛道表现尚可
Flappy paddle boxes were OK on a track,

468
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,430
在开放的道路上也将就,不过在市区里
they work OK on the open road, but in town,

469
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,150
所有的拨片变速箱都相当垃圾
all of them are useless.

470
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,950
他就在额额额地一路纠结着
It's uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, jerking along, and then,

471
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,590
当你想钻空时,它反应得比蜗牛还慢
when you want to exploit a gap,
it's dim-witted and slow.

472
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:15,630
这点尤其不好,因为这座城市一天会有117起交通事故
'This was especially bad in a city where
there are 117 road accidents every DAY.'

473
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:19,910
还没看到一辆车没被撞过的
Haven't actually seen one car yet that isn't dented.

474
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,750
看看那辆!
Look at that one there.

475
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:26,430
红灯在意大利不代表停车
A red light, but that actually
doesn't mean stop. Not in Italy.

476
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,110
它的意思是,"我们正在试用红灯,一会儿我们会试用绿灯"
It means, "We're trying a red light.
In a minute, we'll try a green one."

477
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,120
它和交通的关系不大
It's not relevant to the actual traffic flow.

478
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,510
那辆车是咋回事..? 天啊!
What happened to that?! Oh, dear.

479
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:44,630
我们现在要潇潇洒洒地转上亚壁古道
What we're now going to do,
and this is quite cool, really,

480
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,950
也就是罗马的古路
is turn onto the Via Appia, the ancient Roman road,

481
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,990
没有防滚架武装的智能悬挂系统表现很优秀
and the suspension, with its no anti-roll bars and
its intelligent computer, is doing quite well.

482
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,910
而且相当抢眼
Excellently, in fact.

483
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:01,920
为什么没人去中间的路? 没错,这才是法宝!
Why is nobody using that middle bit?
Yes! That's the ticket!

484
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,800
额,这个,我没想到这条路能这么古罗马
Ah, now, you see, I didn't actually
think it would get quite THAT Roman.

485
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,240
我被一辆Smart超过了!
I'm going to by overtaken by a Smart car!

486
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:23,750
这个时候,我发现了为什么没人用中间的路
'By this stage, I'd worked out why
no-one was using the middle bit. '

487
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,440
我开上电车轨道了
I've got myself on a railway line.

488
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,070
现在怎么办?
Now what am I going to do?

489
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:37,110
不好意思,现在我开上了这个..额..
Sorry. Yeah, now I'm basically going down a... Yes.

490
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,990
好么,我现在开到了铁路路基上..
I'm now driving down a railway embankment...

491
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,600
尼诺餐厅,亚壁古道..
Ristorante Nino, Via Appia...

492
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,430
这附近没什么餐厅

493
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:53,400
你说的没错,它的底盘高度很一般
Yeah, the ground clearance is very poor. OK.

494
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,670
很快,在驶过一条历史之路之后
'Soon, though, after a short drive
through a bit of history... '

495
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,110
不要! 老天爷啊!
No! God Al-bloody-mighty!

496
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,390
我们两个都离目的地很近了
'..We were both near our destination.'

497
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,790
相当接近了
I'm so close.

498
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:17,550
餐厅在30米之外,就在那里了
Now, the restaurant is coming up in 30 metres. 
There it is.

499
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,590
剩下的唯一一项任务就是停车了
'All I had to do now was park.'

500
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:25,430
那里有个停车位,不过车太宽了
如果我停在这里,整条路就会被我堵上了
It must be that now. It's too wide. You see, if I 
park there, I just block the whole street.

501
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,840
天啊,搞笑呢吧?!
Oh, God. No, you're joking.

502
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,350
在这里你怎么停兰博基尼?!
How do you park a Lamborghini here?

503
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,750
这是广场吗? 没错! 我就在正北了
Is that the piazza? I think it is.
I'm right on top of it.

504
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,710
维托里奥街,完全正确!
Via Vittorio. It's correct!

505
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,840
好的,现在找停车位
Right, parking space.

506
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,670
停车停车停车停车
Parking, parking, parking, parking.

507
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,710
用兰博基尼倒车绝对是世界上最"容易"的一件事
It's the easiest thing in the world,
reversing a Lambo.

508
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,760
你只需要从车里出来就行了
You just get out of the car to do it.

509
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,390
能停在那儿吗? 为什么我不能在这儿停呢? 没有停车线
Can I go there? Why can't I go there? 
There's no lines.

510
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,400
詹姆斯・梅同志,准备好一败涂地吧
James May, get ready to lose.

511
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:16,040
-您好?  -您好. 你见过一个长发痴汉么?
-是这位么?
Prego? Prego. Have you seen a very
long-haired man? An idiot? Here.

512
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:26,190
午餐之后,当然因为是我请客,我们没吃午餐
'After lunch, which I didn't bother
with, because I was paying,

513
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,990
我们决定帮助理查德更有效的方法是去购物
'we decided to help Richard 
some more by going shopping.

514
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,790
-然后,我们被惊喜了一下  -那是哈蒙德!
'And then, we got a bit of a surprise.' 
That's Hammond.

515
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,110
不过那不是..
No, but it's not...

516
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:44,510
-你换车了?  -不,这油漆还没干呢
That's a different car. No, no. This is still wet.

517
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,490
别靠在车上,我新刷漆了
Don't lean on it. I painted it.

518
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:48,870
你还神来之笔把方向盘换位置了?
Then you thought, "I'll put
the steering wheel on this side"(?)

519
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,400
一直都是这一边的,因为你一直从后视镜里看我
It's always been on that side. 
You were looking at me in your rear-view mirror.

520
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,310
你这小子换车了!
You have changed cars.

521
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,880
-哈蒙德!  -干嘛?
Hammond? What?

522
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,510
哦,你开玩笑呢吧!! 拜托!
Oh, you're joking! Oh, come on!

523
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,510
这不是我的车,我的是红色的
This isn't my car. Mine's red.

524
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:06,650
-你还没引起轰动啊!
-春哥好!
You haven't caused a stir.
Buongiorno.

525
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,630
那第一个拖车司机
Did that first delivery driver...

526
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,030
那第一个司机什么话都没说么?
Did that first repair man not say anything? No.

527
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,830
我觉得他都没看见我. 我使劲挥手, "嘿,有人在这儿!"
毫无反应
I don't think he could see me.
"Hello! I'm here." No, nothing.

528
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:24,430
不管怎样,我想问一句,Noble这么小的公司
Anyway, can we just ask... 
how did a tiny little company like Noble

529
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,500
怎么能那么快搞到一辆新车的? 实话实说
get another car out there so quickly? 
I'm being serious.

530
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:31,170
-别说谎  -老实说,他们开过来的
Be serious. Seriously, they drove it.

531
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,750
有位老兄彻夜从工厂开来的
A bloke drove it from the factory, overnight,

532
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:36,570
从莱切斯特直达罗马
all the way from Leicester to Rome in one hit.

533
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:40,350
这才是我所说的服务质量呢,
"没问题,先生,我们再送一辆过来就是了"
That's what I call service. "Certainly, sir.
We'll send you another car."

534
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:44,370
不过这是Noble, 他肯定说的是,
"我们会把留下的唯一的一台车送过去"
But it is Noble... you mean, "We'll
send you THE other car"? Yeah.

535
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:50,500
我们的节目稍后继续
现在要邀请一位明星驾驶我们的廉价车了
Anyway, we'll pick that up later on. Now, though, 
it is time to put a star in our reasonably priced car.

536
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,340
让我列一些歌名,"我不恋爱" "威奇托的架线工" "红色女士"
Let me list some songs. I'm Not In
Love, Wichita Lineman, Lady In Red.

537
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:59,810
我今晚的的嘉宾从来没唱过那些歌。
My guest tonight hasn't recorded any of those.

538
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:04,810
那是因为，他来自一个叫“黑眼豆豆”的组织。
That's because he's from an organisation
called the Black Eyed Peas.

539
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:09,830
女士先生们，欢迎，will点i点am点!
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome will.i.am.

540
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:18,630
近来可好？ 很高兴见到你。
很高兴见到你。
How are you? Good to see you.
Good to see you.

541
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,750
你的电邮地址该怎么写啊!
Your e-mail address must be a nightmare!

542
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:38,110
will点i点am点@点a点o点l...
(aol：美国在线，著名的因特网服务提供商)

543
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,420
点uk.

544
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:46,530
我这辈子里从来没见过一个比你还忙的人
I have never met anybody in my entire life
who is apparently as busy as you are,

545
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,830
因为你是一个时装设计师，
because you're a fashion designer,

546
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:54,030
你为奥巴马工作过；
你是《X战警起源》和《马达加斯加》的主演，
you've worked for Obama, starred
in X-Men Origins and Madagascar,

547
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,350
你为弱势青少年建立了个奖学基金。
you run a scholarship fund for
disadvantaged youngsters,

548
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:01,750
你是英特尔的创意总监，你开发了智能手机
you're a creative director at Intel,
you developed smartphones,

549
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,250
你为天下人开创了一番新天地，你还自己作词谱曲
produce everyone the world, make your own music,

550
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:10,010
你是乐队的主唱,为百事可乐,黑莓,本田,杜加迪等公司创作广告曲。

551
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:13,730
而现在，你创立了一家汽车公司 -没错 
什么样的公司？
and you've started a car company.
Yeah. What is it?

552
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:15,000
告诉我们
Tell us about it.

553
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:19,720
额，好吧，当我在为英特尔工作的时候，我发现很多手机
So, um, when I was working at Intel,
I found out that a lot of the phones

554
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:21,180
还有很多日常的东西
and the things that you have

555
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:24,700
不是你手机上写的那个品牌制作的
aren't really made by the name that's on the phone,

556
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:28,290
-而是在很多在东南亚那边的公司制作的  -你说那些零部件?
so there's all these companies in Southeast Asia 
that make all the equipment. You mean the components?

557
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:36,050
嗯.然后你把他们装在一起,就像三明治一样,然后产品就出来了。
Yeah. Then you put them together, like a
sandwich, and then you got your product.

558
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,720
然后我坐在我的车里..
Then I got into my car...

559
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:41,810
我想知道我的宾利的制造成本到底是多少。
I want to know how much it cost to
make this Bentley that I'm driving.

560
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,940
-一辆宾利？  -嗯 
大概38便士！
A Bentley? Yeah. About 38 pence!

561
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:50,260
因为它只是一辆仪表板有些木头的大众车而已。
Right. Cos it's just a Volkswagen
with some wood on the dashboard.

562
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:52,210
所以，在最近的两年里，我们一直在我的电脑上搞研究设计
So, for the past two years,
we've been tooling, design things on my computer.

563
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:56,580
我做的第一个改装的名字叫“雷维特”
The first thing I did was a Thundervet,

564
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,830
就是你拿一辆雷鸟和一辆科尔维特混交。。。
where you take a Thunderbird and a vet...

565
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,060
我们这里有一张照片。
We've got a photograph of it.

566
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:04,940
-嗯，那就是“雷维特”  
-那看起来像是一辆50年代的克尔维特
Yeah, that's a Thundervet.
Cos that looks like a '50s vet.

567
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:07,090
车身上白色的缺口就是典型的50年代科尔维特风格
The white slash is '50s vet, but there's

568
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:09,220
-还有一些雷鸟的东西混杂在一起？ -恩
some Thunderbird in there, as well? Yeah.

569
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:13,870
额，这个凹槽和其他一些东西。
这些不是白色边的轮胎。
So, the groove and stuff. And those
wheels aren't white-wall tyres.

570
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:17,790
那是白边轮毂，里面是五幅式的。
That's a white-wall rim, 
with the five-spoke inside of it.

571
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,700
噢，那其实是一个轮毂？
Oh, that's the actual rim?

572
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:23,380
-没错  -简直太漂亮了。这货搭载什么引擎了？
Yeah. That's fantastic. So, what engine has it got?

573
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:26,260
它搭载一个超大号的科尔维特引擎。
That has a super-sized
Corvette engine in it.

574
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:29,100
那么你现在设计你自己的车了没？
就是自己设计的车身的车。
And have you designed your own
car now, with its own body?

575
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,460
有,这只是一个试验品,来试验我们究竟能干什么
Yes. So, that was just, you know,
let's test what we can do with this.

576
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:36,780
以那车作为标准，我们自己打造一辆车。
From there, we go on to something
that we built from scratch.

577
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:41,300
-我想我们也有那车的照片  -这就是IAMAUTO 88
I think we've got a picture of it, as well. 
IAMAUTO 88.

578
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:44,900
那真像一台老玛莎拉蒂总裁，只不过这是两门的。
It's a bit like an old Maserati
Quattroporte, except it's two-door.

579
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:48,690
-而且那是加州制造的?  -那是在我出生的贫民窟那里制造的
-为什么？真的？
And that's made in California? That's made down 
in the ghetto that I'm from. Why...? Really?

580
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,480
我的人生目标是，我要制作音乐，那样我就可以照顾我妈
Yeah. My whole thing was, "I'm going to
make music so I can take care of my mom,

581
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:58,030
然后将我全家搬离贫民窟。
"and move my family out the ghetto."

582
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:01,570
如果那是我的目标，我就不会停。
So, if that's what I want to do,
then it's going to keep me going,

583
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,550
我不会有后退这个选项
so there's no "no" for an answer.

584
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:07,210
然后，我现在已经完成这个目标了
我家里的所有人。。。
So, now that I've done that, and
every single person in my family...

585
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,440
堂兄弟，叔伯，侄女
和侄子。。。全都搬离贫民窟了，
cousins, uncles, nieces
and nephews... are out the ghetto,

586
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:15,580
我想回到我的贫民窟，然后创立一家汽车公司。
I want to go back to my ghetto
and build a car company.

587
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:19,020
我们一直都在抱怨欠发展地区拖了我们的后腿，
We all complain about underdeveloped communities,

588
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:22,140
不过要谁来发展他们呢?
but who are the developers in the first place?

589
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:25,220
所以我想,“我已经很烦抱怨和指责神马的了。”
So, I was like, "I'm tired of
complaining and pointing fingers.

590
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:29,430
为什么我自己不想清楚，扪心自问，
"Why don't I aim that finger to me and say,

591
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,500
哥们，你有什么办法能改变你的贫民窟家乡？
"'Hey, what are you doing to change
the ghetto you're from?'"

592
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,470
你是我邀请的嘉宾里面最鼓舞人生志向的嘉宾之一了
Do you know, you're one of the most inspiring people 
we've ever had sitting in that sofa.

593
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,420
毫无疑问吧?
He is, though, isn't he?

594
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:46,260
如果每个人都这样想，我们的经济发展也会飞天了！
If everybody thought like that,
we'd have 1.65% growth as well!

595
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,670
说说你的汽车史吧
Um, can we just go into your car history?

596
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:51,060
从什么时候开始的？你的第一辆车是什么？
Where did it begin? What was your first car?

597
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:55,970
在我17岁的时候,我给自己买了一辆..
So, I got a record deal when I was
17 and I bought myself...

598
00:41:56,090 --> 00:42:01,220
因为我一直想要辆法拉利,或者德罗宁
（电影《回到未来》的时光机车型）
cos I always wanted a Ferrari or a DeLorean.

599
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:04,930
那是我最喜欢的车。但我买不起。。。
Those were my favourite cars.
I couldn't afford those,

600
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:07,990
所以我买了辆穷逼中的法拉利，菲罗。
so I got the poor man's Ferrari, which is a Fiero.

601
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:13,460
额，那的确挺穷逼的。那是穷逼中的MR2。
Yeah, that's really poor.
That's even the poor man's MR2.

602
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,920
我那辆是黄色的。
I had a yellow one.

603
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:18,350
中置引擎，所以看起来也像是法拉利
Mid-engine, so it was kind of like a Ferrari

604
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,020
如果你在5英里之外外眯着眼看
if you were standing five miles away and squinting!

605
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:26,900
然后,我的邻居皮尔林出卖了我。
And then my next-door neighbour Pearleen snitched.

606
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:31,380
她告诉我妈，
“(美国黑人口音)噢，黛布拉阿姨，小威威买了一辆车哦。”
She told my mom, 
"Ooh, Debra, Willy got himself a new car."

607
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:35,650
然后我妈叫我进屋里。
And then my mom calls me in the house.

608
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,530
“(继续口音)孩子，屁股放椅子上。”
"Boy, sit your butt down on this couch."

609
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:40,940
"(继续口音)妈，干嘛？"
"你哪来的权利买那傻X车?"
"What, Momma?
"You got no business buying yourself no G-damn car.

610
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:43,820
"但是.."
"Yeah, but..."

611
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:47,220
"但是你个头。给我那傻X钥匙。"
"No but nothing. Gimme them damn keys."

612
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:51,380
嗯，她没收了我的车。
So she confiscated my car.

613
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:54,980
然后在我20岁以前都不能开车。
So then I couldn't drive until I was 20.

614
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:59,540
就放在那里不动？一辆2000美金的车楞放了三年？
So it just sat there? A 2,000...Car. For three years?

615
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,230
三年来一直放在那里。
For three years it sat there.

616
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,880
能开它的20岁前,每一天我都是度日如年
I couldn't wait till I was 20, then I could drive it.

617
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,860
黑眼豆豆..你卖了多少张唱片？几百万吧
Black Eyed Peas... how many records
have you sold? Millions.

618
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:11,720
-根据现有的数据，4000多万。
-4000多万？
To date, 40 something million records. 40 million?

619
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:14,100
太强悍了,而且你还有个..
It is massive. And you've got...

620
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:16,150
没错，4000万。
Yeah! 40 million.

621
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:22,090
还有你现在新出了个独唱的专辑？
And you've now got a solo album out.

622
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:28,520
而且它叫"两横两竖,威尔力量"
And it's called Squiggle Squiggle #willpower.

623
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:32,180
-不，那是个井字号,"#威尔力量"  
-那么是"井字号,威尔力量"
No, it's just #willpower. #willpower.

624
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,970
不过那两横两竖..噢,是井字号!
There are squiggles.
Oh, it's a hash!

625
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:39,260
我还以为那是一个印刷错误呢
I just thought it was like a misprint. No, no.

626
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:45,470
-你有没有被一个比我更老的人采访过？
-额，这个..没有..
Have you ever been interviewed by
somebody more old than me? Um... no...

627
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:55,740
现在,你来到这儿..看着你的手套,还以为是来打高尔夫
不过不是来打高尔夫的
Now, you came down here, obviously... well, looking at
your gloves, to play golf, but, um, it isn't a Golf.

628
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:59,220
不，不。我戴这些不包住手指的手套的原因是
No, no. The reason I have fingerless gloves is

629
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:02,380
哥有很多触摸屏设备
because I got touchscreen technology devices,

630
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:06,300
所以你最不愿意发生的事情就是，
你带着手套,突然手机响了..
so last thing you want is, in the cold,
I have to go, "My phone is ringing..."

631
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:10,780
不过你还可以买那种上面有指纹的手套
戴上它,你很容易就能..我就有一双
No, cos you can buy gloves that have got
fingerprint things, so wearing... I've got a pair.

632
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:12,740
它们太老土了。
They're not fashion.

633
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:17,060
那是世界上最丑的手套。
There you go! They're the ugliest
gloves in the world.

634
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:20,090
我承认，它们看上去挺穷逼的。
They look pretty poor, I admit.

635
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:26,430
我记得你坚持要开一辆自动挡的车,拒绝了手动挡
You insisted, I believe, in driving 
the automatic car, rather than the stick-shift.

636
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,140
那么你自我感觉怎么样？
Yeah. So, how did it go out there?

637
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:33,180
我觉得我干得不错,如果从各种冲出赛道的水平来评价的话
I think I did pretty good,
if you judge me on spinning.

638
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:38,380
额，好吧，谁要看威哥的打滑？
Well, now, who would like to see some of Will's spins?

639
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:42,140
我们精心挑选了一些，看看吧。
We have a selection. Let's have a look.

640
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:45,070
没错,倒数第二个弯道
Yes, there we go. Second-to-last corner.

641
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:49,090
士兵突击..他控制住了..没控制住..哎呀呀..
Bold as brass. He's held it...
No, he hasn't! Ooh!

642
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:53,330
那是一个鱼尾打滑..于是又来了一次
That's a tank-slapper, that one was.
Yeah. Here we go again.

643
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:57,860
转来转去！
Spinny!

644
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:03,900
为什么我们在鼓掌？全是各种失败镜头。
Why are we applauding? Those were mistakes.

645
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:08,780
你应该弄一个漂移奖神马的。。。
You probably want to have a different spin award...

646
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:11,180
谁要看最终的跑圈？
Who would like to see the finished lap?

647
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:14,820
好吧，坐稳咯。
Let's play the tape. Here we go.

648
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:20,940
自动挡都能让轮胎空转,真是技术活
Needs to spin with an automatic box.
Like to see it!

649
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,260
上吧
Right, here we go.

650
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:28,560
第一弯。像很多F1车手一样，走线很宽。
Here's the first corner.
Wide line, like a Formula 1 driver.

651
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,130
轮胎在嚎叫。。。尽管地面湿滑！
Tyre squeal... even in the wet!

652
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:34,220
噢，很利落。相当利落啊。
Oh, that's nicely done. That was nicely done.

653
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:36,340
刹车。。。
Brake...

654
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:38,780
寡言老男人
A man of few words.

655
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,860
走线很顺,很好的通过了那弯道。
That's nice and smooth through there.

656
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:44,210
很好的宽走线，这样能让动力完全输出。
Good wide lines, so you
can get the power down.

657
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,890
来到锤头弯
And up to the Hammerhead.

658
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:50,780
在这里呀么重刹车..
# Brake hard, brake here... #

659
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:54,740
-你在唱歌啊？ -让我集中注意力神马的。
Were you singing? To keep myself focused and stuff.

660
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:56,700
我有点紧张。。。
I was getting kinda nervous.

661
00:45:56,710 --> 00:46:01,310
-白线儿，白线儿。。。
-很漂亮。
# The line and the lines... #
It's good.

662
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:04,580
听听这C一撇D的引擎声
C apostrophe D now. Listen to that engine.

663
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,740
我勒个去，传说中的运动声音。
Wow! That's a sporty noise.

664
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:10,500
快跑啊,你个2B青年专用车！
Go! Stupid car!

665
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:14,900
看似不错。。。
Looking good through there...

666
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:18,660
喔，扬起了点刚刚冲出赛道挂上的尘土。
Oh, there's a bit of dirt
from an earlier spin coming out.

667
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:20,740
通过轮胎墙。
Through the tyres.

668
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:24,700
通过倒数第二个弯，会有问题么？
Are we going to get through the
second-to-last without a problem?

669
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:28,260
切弯切得恰到好处! 到达甘邦弯..
That was cut perfectly. And Gambon...

670
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:30,460
保持紧凑的走线..当我没说
Keep it in tight... All right, don't.

671
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:33,140
冲过终点线！
And there we are! And across the line!

672
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:46,770
你开的是自动挡，自然会慢点
So... Now, you're driving the automatic,
so that's slower, obviously,

673
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:50,780
而且还在下雨，所以我们不要期望太高
and it's raining, so we're not looking
for a particularly fast time.

674
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,670
不过呢..其实我在想，
Um... but... I'm trying to think, actually.

675
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:57,470
自动挡嘉宾。。。目前为止我们只有两个。
Automatic drivers... we've only had
two so far in this car.

676
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:59,780
他们是约翰・普雷斯科特(英国前首相)。
They are John Prescott.

677
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:03,240
-你不认识他吧？ -嗯。
You don't know John Prescott? Hmm.

678
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:04,980
他也是时装设计师。
He's a fashion designer.

679
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:09,060
还有艾利斯・库柏(摇滚乐歌手)
And Alice Cooper. OK?

680
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:12,980
-这两个是唯一的自动挡嘉宾，大概都在1:56左右
-而且都是湿圈。
Those are the only automatics, and
they're both 1.56. And they're wet.

681
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:15,960
嗯，都是湿的，都是自动挡。
Oh, yeah. Both had wet days,
both driving automatics.

682
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:18,390
都在1分56秒区域。
Both in the 1.56.3 region.

683
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:24,510
will点i点am点， 你的成绩是一分..
will.i.am., you did it in 1...

684
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:28,020
四十..
40...

685
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,340
九秒四
9.4.

686
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,820
嗯，湿圈和自动挡。
So, you get wet and auto,

687
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:39,380
这个圈速是湿+自动里面最快的！
and that's the fastest we've ever had
in that car in those conditions! Yay!

688
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:41,870
你排在..这里
You are... there.

689
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:50,200
在埃塞克斯的23岁的皮塔之上,乔纳森・罗斯之下
So, above Peta, 23, from Essex... Below Jonathan Ross.

690
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:52,540
-Stig的教授水平不赖啊!  -没错
Stig did a good thing, then. Oh, yeah.

691
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:54,980
那单圈令人印象深刻,你真正竭尽了全力
That was impressive, and you were trying.

692
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:59,770
能邀请你来既鼓舞人的意志,又是巨大的愉悦
It has been genuinely inspirational 
having you here, and an enormous pleasure.

693
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:02,240
女士们先生们,欢送威廉!
Ladies and gentlemen, will.i.am! Thank you!

694
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:20,060
好的,回到我们的超级跑车路测
Right, now, we must get back to our big supercar test.

695
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:24,500
目前为止,我们已经看到我的Noble是最快的,最省油的
So far, we've established that my Noble
is the fastest and the most economical.

696
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:27,590
-也是最不可靠的  -玩去..
The most unreliable. Yes, funny. 

697
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:30,660
我们也看到了我的迈凯轮在市区表现最佳
We've also established that 
the McLaren is the best around town,

698
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:36,910
-而杰里米的兰博大白痴还什么都没赢呢 -什么都没赢!
and that Jeremy's big, idiotic Lamborghini
hasn't actually won anything. Nothing! Zero.

699
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:40,470
零. 各种鸭蛋各种圈...
Hmm. Nil. Zilch. Rien. Nowt.

700
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:44,740
-零的平方根  -什么都没赢,这个我们有目共睹
The square root of Jack.
Nothing... we've established that!

701
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:48,100
让我们继续吧,现在要放第三段
Let's move on,
because it's time now for part three,

702
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:52,510
其中我们面临着我们做过的最危险的事
in which we three must face the most
dangerous thing we've ever done.

703
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,340
在我们为与命运女神的约会一路向北时
'As we headed north to our date with destiny,

704
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:04,020
我们开始把我们的车与终极擂主进行比较
'we started to think about how
our cars compare to the daddy.'

705
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:06,340
三天前,如果你问我
Three days ago, if you'd said to me,

706
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:10,340
"你想要一辆Aventador还是法拉利458?"
"Which would you rather have, 
an Aventador or Ferrari 458?"

707
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:14,460
我肯定会选法拉利,因为那是明智之选
I would have said, "The Ferrari."
I mean, it's the obvious choice.

708
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:18,820
不过如果你现在问我,我会选这个
But now... No, I'd have this.

709
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:25,500
我清楚法拉利458是绝对的技术结晶,它的外形也令人窒息
I know a Ferrari 458 is just a technical
masterpiece and it looks wonderful,

710
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:28,530
不过这辆车有一些法拉利不具备的东西
but this has got something the Ferrari doesn't have.

711
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:31,550
它有个性
It has... It has a character.

712
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:35,500
这就像一条愚蠢的橙色的狗
It's like a big, daft orange dog!

713
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:37,710
人人都爱橙色大蠢狗!
Everybody wants a big, daft orange dog!

714
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:45,300
它完全赢得了我的心. 它不仅是这三辆中最棒的
It's won me over. Completely.
It's not just the best car here.

715
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:47,580
它比法拉利458还要更胜一筹
It's better than the Ferrari 458.

716
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:51,540
对我来说,它是世界上最棒的几辆车之一. 我爱上它了
For me, it's one of the best cars in
the world now. I absolutely love it.

717
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:57,300
它就像一辆赛车,不过没有赛车的不实用和不舒适
It feels like a race car but without
the impracticality and discomfort.

718
00:49:57,310 --> 00:50:01,500
的确,它的制造商是英国一个没人听说过的厂子
But, yes, they're a small make in the
UK that nobody has ever heard of.

719
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:07,430
不过帕加尼的风之子也是诞生于一个没人听说过的厂子
Well, at one time, so was Mr Pagani, making his Zonda.

720
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:13,020
已经有两票反对法拉利了. 那么詹姆斯怎么想?
So, that's two votes against the Ferrari. 
But what about James?

721
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:16,300
这辆车很棒,我越来越喜欢它
This is brilliant. 
I'm really, really growing to like it,

722
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:22,900
不要忘了它比法拉利458要便宜3万5千英镑
and let's not forget it's ￡35,000
or so cheaper than the Ferrari 458.

723
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:26,100
那可是不少的一笔钱
And that is a huge amount of money.

724
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:29,220
不过他还是..我也不知道
But there's still... I don't know.

725
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:32,660
我感觉法拉利的换挡更干脆
The Ferrari, I think the gear change 
feels a bit crisper,

726
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:35,820
整车的一切都更清晰
and everything feels a little better defined, somehow.

727
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:39,060
可能这就是无法形容出来的激情吧
It's the fizz, I'm afraid. 
I can't explain it. I just...

728
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:41,990
法拉利能给我带来更多的激情
The Ferrari still gives me more fizz.

729
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:47,020
你已经到达目的地
'You have reached your destination.'

730
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:50,940
事实证明,目的地是一条赛道
'The destination turned out to be a racetrack...

731
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:53,350
它的名叫伊莫拉
'called Imola...

732
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:57,540
小小休整之后
'..where, after a quick change,

733
00:50:57,550 --> 00:51:01,460
我们到维修区接受挑战
'we were told to report to the pits for a challenge.'

734
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:08,100
你们现在要在赛道上跑圈,并尝试击败法拉利458的圈速
"You will now lap the circuit, attempting
to beat the time set by a Ferrari 458."

735
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:11,740
-谁来开458呢?  -上面说不是Stig
Who's driving a 458?
It says here he's not The Stig.

736
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:14,990
而是Stig的意大利表兄
But he is The Stig's Italian cousin!

737
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:25,060
这是色迷迷Stig么?
It's "Bunga-Bunga" Stig.

738
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:27,500
他都干嘛了?
What's he been doing?!

739
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:29,830
扑克牌
Cards.

740
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:35,940
不管他都干嘛了
'Whatever it was he'd been doing,

741
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:41,060
显然他驾驶的能量还是够的
'he plainly still had
plenty of energy left for driving.

742
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:47,020
并跑出了一个吓人的时间 - 1分56秒6
'And posted a daunting time of 1.56.6.

743
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:50,380
在尝试击败这个时间之前
'Before trying to beat that,
we thought it best to spend

744
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:55,670
我们觉得开着车在赛道上试试手还是很有必要的
'a little time learning how our cars
behaved on a proper racetrack.'

745
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:05,550
赛道模式的换挡太野蛮了
That gear change in track mode is absolutely savage.

746
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:09,390
上那个路肩!
Ride that kerb!

747
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:13,540
四轮驱动系统简直令人窒息
Four-wheel drive system is breathtaking.

748
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:17,460
动力在不断地改变方向,向前,向后,向左,向右
The power is constantly moving around... front, back,

749
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:21,390
你总是有足够的抓地力
side to side... so you've always
got the grip you need.

750
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:26,860
好处是,我的刹车是碳纤维的,所以不会过热
The good thing is, I have carbon
brakes which will not fade.

751
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:30,390
可怜鼹鼠同学的刹车是钢制的,会过热
Poor old Hammond has got steel brakes, which will.

752
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:34,020
注意力集中,要顺滑
Focus. Smoothness.

753
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:39,340
这样的跑车没有驾驶辅助和计算机,只有你和这台机器
A car like this, with no driver aids, no computers
messing about, it's just you and the car.

754
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:43,940
唯一的机会就是出弯之后
The only chance I stand here is to
get it out of the corners

755
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:47,070
能够充分利用它的动力
in such a shape that I can use that power.

756
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:52,820
当然,迈凯轮有一大堆的驾驶辅助系统
Of course, the McLaren does have a lot of driver aids,

757
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:57,260
不过"方向感船长"有更重要的事情来担心
but Captain Sense Of Direction had
more important things on this mind.

758
00:52:57,270 --> 00:53:00,460
这弯怎么过来着? 想不起来了
What's this one? I can't remember.

759
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:04,100
这是我不需要刹车的弯角
This is the bit where I don't have to brake...

760
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:05,910
如果我没记错的话..
If I can remember this bit...

761
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:11,940
一天收工之后,我们了解了赛道,了解了我们的跑车
At the end of the day, we knew
the circuit and we knew our cars.

762
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:15,940
不过我们一点自信心都没有
But still, we were not feeling 
even remotely confident,

763
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:17,950
因为这里是伊莫拉
because this is Imola...

764
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:21,820
这个星球上最危险的几条赛道之一
one of the most dangerous tracks on Earth.

765
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:27,670
它狭窄高速,并被毫无怜悯心的树林和护墙所包围
It's narrow, fast and ringed with
unforgiving walls and trees.

766
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:31,660
吉列・维伦纽夫
Gilles Villeneuve,

767
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:33,580
杰哈德・伯格
Gerhard Berger,

768
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:39,220
尼尔森・皮奎特, 里卡多・帕特里塞, 鲁本・巴里切罗..
Nelson Piquet, Riccardo Patrese,
Rubens Barrichello...

769
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:46,100
历史上,这条赛道的每一个弯角都结果了一些大人物的赛车
at some point in history, every corner
here has claimed the ego of a big name.

770
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:49,350
而某些赛道结果了比赛车更珍贵的东西..
And some corners have claimed even more than that.

771
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:56,220
1994年塞纳丧命之后
After Senna's death in 1994,

772
00:53:56,230 --> 00:54:00,580
赛道作出调整,降低了赛车的速度
changes were made to the track to slow the cars down,

773
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:03,860
不过尽管如此,如果我们想击败那台法拉利
but even so, if we were going to beat that Ferrari,

774
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:09,190
转过一号弯的时速仍然能达到200英里
we would still be going through the
first bend at nearly 200mph.

775
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:18,630
所以,那一天晚上,我们每个人都与自己的车独处了一小会
So, that night, each of us spent a little
time alone with the cars we'd be using.

776
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:23,540
你就是尤文图斯队
YOU are Juventus.

777
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:29,700
明天你将对阵沃金城和莱切斯特城
And tomorrow, you're taking on
Woking Town and Leicester City.

778
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:36,670
全英格兰的球迷都想让他们赢,因为他们不占上风
And everybody in England is going to want 
them to win,because they're the underdogs.

779
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:38,540
不过不要担心
But don't you worry.

780
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:43,860
我们虽然还未赢得一项挑战
We haven't won a single challenge yet,

781
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:47,990
不过明天..就变了
but tomorrow... that will change.

782
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:54,100
这场战斗,你没有用复杂的智能芯片武装到牙齿
You're not going into battle armed with
a sophisticated computer and wizardry,

783
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:58,500
你也没有敏捷的悬挂和四轮驱动,你只有一台引擎
clever suspension, four-wheel drive.
You're just going in with an engine.

784
00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:01,860
用古老的方式战斗
Doing it the old-fashioned way.

785
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:06,430
不管你占不占上风,我知道你现在已是破釜沉舟
Underdog or not, I know you've got it in you now.

786
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,830
我太希望我们赢得胜利了
I'd love us to win.

787
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:13,770
记住,当我们驶上赛道
Just remember, as we're going round and

788
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:16,740
当你无限纠结于我的杯具换挡
you're despairing of my terrible gear changes

789
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:18,720
以及我的杯具过弯等等等等时
and my bad apexes, and things,

790
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:22,370
记住,你来自于迈凯轮,你有着这些车里面最棒的赛车血统
you're made by McLaren.
You've got the best race pedigree.

791
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,290
你有敏捷的悬挂
You've got clever suspension,

792
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:26,780
没有防滚架,你还有一台电脑
you've got no roll bars, you've got a computer,

793
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:30,300
你可以为我制动车轮,你都可以自己完成很多任务
you can brake the wheel for me,
you can virtually do it by yourself.

794
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:36,420
你只需要娱乐我一下,记住我龟速船长的称号
All you have to do is humour me a bit,
and remember that I'm Captain Slow.

795
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:39,830
或者是意大利人们给我的"蜗牛先生"的美名
Or Mr Slowly, as the Italians call me.

796
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:43,740
第二天早上
'The next morning,

797
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:50,590
我们开始在赛道上冒险,并尝试击败Stig的1分56秒6的成绩
'we ventured onto this terrifying track
to try and beat The Stig's 1.56.6.'

798
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:57,550
天啊,这真是快!
God, this is quick!

799
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:01,300
妈呀!!
Oh, my giddy aunt!

800
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:04,340
我出赛道了!
I'm off the road!

801
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:06,390
重回赛道上了!
I'm on it again!

802
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:09,910
天啊,在这里开得更快了
My God, I'm faster here.

803
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:15,030
太凶险了. 我靠
This is outrageous. Oh, BLEEP.

804
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:22,230
不要被理智束缚,别当胆小鬼!
Now, faster than you think. Don't be a wimp.

805
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:26,380
啊!! 有可能被吓尿了
Agh! A bit of wee may be coming out!

806
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:32,470
别太早刹车,别太早刹车. 现在刹车!
Don't brake too early. Don't brake too early. Now!

807
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:36,540
强多了
Better.

808
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:41,830
不寻常的是,这个挑战我们很在乎
'Unusually, we were all taking this
challenge very seriously... '

809
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:48,080
-2分零5秒4, 2分零4秒9.  -2分零2秒整
-哦,不,我才开到2分零7秒
2:05.4, 2:04.9. Oh, no. I'm still on 2.07.

810
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:52,470
不过我们清楚,要想击败法拉利
'..But we knew we'd have to try even harder

811
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,560
我们还要更加努力
if we were going to beat that Ferrari.'

812
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:59,260
加油啊,梅,你个二愣子! 前进!
Right, come on, May, you blithering idiot. Avanti.

813
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:04,140
漂亮!
Good!

814
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:06,420
入弯..刹车!
In... Braking down.

815
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:10,270
狠一点!
Get cocky!

816
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:16,230
赛道还在,别松懈!
The track WILL be there. Keep it in!

817
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:21,340
妙!
Yes!

818
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:24,310
我现在要发疯一点了
I'm going a bit mental here, now.

819
00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:29,950
刹车..有点糟糕
Brake... Ooh, that's messy.

820
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:38,700
我要进五档,我要TM敢开多快开多快
I'm going to go for 5th. I'm going to take 
as much through here as I bloody dare. Oh!

821
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:50,100
加油!
Come on!

822
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:52,670
时速290公里
290...

823
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:57,910
刹车失灵了,哇,刹车过热了
OK, brakes have gone. Whoa.
Failure from the brakes.

824
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:04,500
在我的刹车冷却,哈蒙德把砂石清理出去之后
After my brakes had cooled, 
and Hammond had emptied his car of gravel,

825
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:10,700
我们重上赛道开始击败458的最后一次尝试
we went back out for
one final attempt to beat the 458.

826
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:15,150
兰博的背水一战了! 来了,加油!!
And the Lambo is only... Here we go! Come on!

827
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:20,740
最后一次了,我为了莱切斯特的荣誉而战!
OK, this is it. I'm doing this one for Leicester!

828
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:23,790
给力啊!
Right, Beans!

829
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:30,070
这就对了!
That's it!

830
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:37,190
现在刹车!
And now brake!

831
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:41,060
困难的部分已经过去了!
I've done the difficult bit!

832
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:43,780
能过去,一定能过去
It will go round, it WILL.

833
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:45,190
加油!
Come on!

834
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:49,940
刹车..
And brake...

835
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:54,750
重拾动力越快越好. 现在,现在!! 动力!!!
And back on the power as soon
as you can. Now. NOW! NOW! Power!

836
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:10,230
保持右边,保持右边..入弯!
Stay right, stay right, stay right!
Stay right, now!

837
00:59:13,870 --> 00:59:18,260
加速加速! 加油!
Stretch it, stretch it! Come on! Come on!

838
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:19,990
加油加油!!
Come on! Come on!

839
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:25,230
没问题的! 给力!!
You can do it! Come on!

840
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:41,980
-那看起来和实际上一样吓人  -的确很恐怖
That looked as scary as it was. Yes, it was scary.

841
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:45,260
就是那可感觉的"我的妈呀"时刻
It's that palpable sense of, "Oh, my God!"

842
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:50,100
必须要说,在驶过维修区的大直路上,赛道不是笔直的
Because I have to say, as you go past
the pits, the track is not straight,

843
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:53,700
赛道是有弯的,不过你不敢松油门
it's a curve, and you daren't lift off, 
because the crews,

844
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:58,340
因为摄像组能够听到引擎的声音改变
所以你不得不死死地保持踩着油门
they can hear the engine note change, so
you have to keep your foot hard down.

845
00:59:58,350 --> 01:00:02,540
-很恐怖的  -时速是200英里多..?
-超过了200英里
It was terrifying.
It is 200 and...? Over 200.

846
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:08,300
我们三个的瞬时时速都超过了F1赛车在那一段的速度
All three of us doing over 200, and that's faster
than a Formula 1 car, was going through there.

847
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:10,380
F1只能开到时速180英里左右
They could only do about 180.

848
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:12,350
我什么都不知道,因为我的眼睛闭的死死的
I don't know, because I had my eyes shut.

849
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:14,300
太吓人了
It was terrifying.

850
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:19,100
不管怎样,现在要揭晓我们三个的最快圈速了
Anyway, it is time now to reveal who
was the fastest of the three of us.

851
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:23,460
-哈蒙德?  -我的圈速是2分零3秒3
Richard Hammond? I did it
in 2 minutes and 3.3 seconds.

852
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:25,220
已经到达我的极限了
That's the best I could do.

853
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:26,580
"蜗牛先生"?
Mr Slowly?

854
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:29,900
2分零6秒4
2 minutes 6.4.

855
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:32,540
-太好了!  -你呢?
Yes! And you?

856
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:37,700
-这时候不显得装X可有点难度..  -天啊..
It's so difficult not to look
smug at this point. Oh, God!

857
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:43,100
-不管用的  -1分59秒1!
It's not working.
1... Ooh! ..59.1.

858
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:49,230
掩饰不了的
You're not pulling it off.

859
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:55,460
-不管用  -的确不行,算了吧
It's not working. It isn't. No, I'll forget it.

860
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:58,700
那么把问题搞清楚. 你开得很漂亮
Let me just straighten this out, OK? Well done.

861
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:02,490
我们每人都把车发挥到了极限,不过还是没能击败法拉利
We gave it everything, each of us,
and we didn't beat the Ferrari. No.

862
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:05,120
慢着,这没有什么关系
Hang on. That's not strictly relevant,

863
01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:06,930
这整个挑战的重点就是,如果你不想要法拉利
because the point of this was to see which car

864
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:09,100
你应该选择哪一台车
you should have IF you didn't want a Ferrari.

865
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:11,740
-没错,应该选兰博  -才不是!
-就是兰博嘛!
Yes, it's the Lambo. No. It isn't. It IS the Lambo.

866
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:14,440
我承认,这不是一辆完美的赛道用车
I admit, it's not a brilliant track car, 

867
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,350
在纳多赛道,它的轮胎必须要换,这是个麻烦事
because at Nardo, it's tyres had to be changed, 
it was a problem there.

868
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:21,320
不知怎么它又把碳刹车烧废了
And somehow it boiled its carbon brake, 
no idea how it did that.

869
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:27,720
不过它就是条橙色的大蠢狗,排气管还会喷蓝色火焰
But it IS a big, daft orange dog, AND
blue stuff comes out of the exhaust.

870
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:33,370
听好,在那一天,Noble教会我的驾驶技术
No. Look, that Noble taught me more
about driving in that one day

871
01:01:33,410 --> 01:01:35,680
比其它任何一辆车教会我的都多
than any other car has ever taught me.

872
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:39,240
-这是纯粹的驾驶感觉  -稍安勿躁
It's about the real undiluted experience. Silence.

873
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:43,400
迈凯轮是相比终极战车458最接近的一辆车
The McLaren is the closest thing
to the 458, which is the best,

874
01:01:43,410 --> 01:01:45,150
所以迈凯轮是这三辆车中最棒的
therefore the McLaren is the best car here.

875
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:48,470
-它的排气管会喷蓝色火焰吗?  -没有
Does blue stuff come out of the exhaust? No.

876
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:51,720
-那不就完了  -问题是,我们还是不能达成共识
Exactly. Well, there you are.
The thing is, we can't agree.

877
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:54,120
其实我们永远也不能达成共识
And actually, we never will. No.

878
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:57,720
以这个猛料作为结尾,节目结束的时间到了
非常感谢大家的收看
And on that bombshell, it is time to
end. Thanks very much for watching.

879
01:01:57,730 --> 01:01:59,330
我们下周见! 晚安!
See you next week. Good night!
