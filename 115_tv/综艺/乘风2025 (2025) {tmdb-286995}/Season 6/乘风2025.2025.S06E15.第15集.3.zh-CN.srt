1
00:00:41,533 --> 00:00:46,126
今晚的课真是太完美了
Oh, I had the most exquisite class this evening.

2
00:00:46,136 --> 00:00:47,210
我的学生们在排练
My students are rehearsing

3
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,905
《灵欲春宵》里拳击的那场戏
the boxing scene from "Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?"

4
00:00:49,915 --> 00:00:51,526
我只庆幸他们用的是你的工作室
I'm just glad they were using your studio

5
00:00:51,535 --> 00:00:52,753
而不是我的卧室
and not my living room.

6
00:00:53,501 --> 00:00:58,172
你在给我做你拿手的烤意面配干酪土司
Oh, you're making me your fabulous pasta carbonara.

7
00:00:58,172 --> 00:01:00,195
你不用这么费心的
Ohh. You shouldn't have.

8
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,318
不是给你的
I didn't.

9
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:02,794
实际上是给阿丽克西斯的
Actually, it's for Alexis.

10
00:01:02,804 --> 00:01:04,952
她最近太忙了
She's just been, you know, so busy lately.

11
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,583
我想借机联络感情
I thought we'd, uh, reconnect.

12
00:01:06,592 --> 00:01:08,491
所以做了她最爱吃的
Mm. So her favorite dish,

13
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:11,455
然后再一起看《电锯惊魂4》的导演剪辑版
and then a screening of "Saw iv," the director's cut.

14
00:01:11,464 --> 00:01:13,718
我真不忍心告诉你  亲爱的  她不会回来了
Uh, I hate to tell you this, darling, but she won't be here.

15
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,898
什么意思  她还能去哪里
What do you mean? Where else would she be?

16
00:01:14,907 --> 00:01:16,279
她又开始新的实习工作了
She's starting a new internship.

17
00:01:17,027 --> 00:01:17,698
又换了个
Another one?

18
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:21,314
她确实说过她想试些新鲜事物来找到她的激情
She did say she wanted to try a few things to find her passion.

19
00:01:21,678 --> 00:01:23,558
现在是九点
It's 9:00 o'clock.

20
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:26,943
她这个时候能找到什么样的激情
What kind of passion is she finding at this time of night?

21
00:01:28,267 --> 00:01:30,798
你的另一半来电了
Aha. There. Your better half.

22
00:01:31,144 --> 00:01:32,851
别转移话题
Don't change the subject.

23
00:01:33,637 --> 00:01:35,507
她到底在实习什么
What is this internship exactly?

24
00:01:35,555 --> 00:01:37,665
理查德  阿丽克西斯让我发誓保密的
Richard, Alexis swore me to secrecy.

25
00:01:37,675 --> 00:01:38,663
是  可身为她的父亲
Yes, but as her father--

26
00:01:38,672 --> 00:01:40,494
我的嘴可闭得死死的
Ah, ah, ah, ah. My lips are sealed.

27
00:01:40,504 --> 00:01:44,848
那你就吃不了我的烤意面配干酪吐司了
Then you won't be using them to eat my... pasta carbonara.

28
00:01:45,174 --> 00:01:46,239
好吧  我这么说吧
All right. Well, let me say this.

29
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:49,950
她这份实习是经过我亲自批准的
This internship has my personal seal of approval.

30
00:01:51,523 --> 00:01:53,115
这并没能让我舒坦点
That doesn't make me feel any better.

31
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:56,980
其实  问题不在于她去实习
The truth is, the internship isn't the problem.

32
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,495
而是她已经找了三份实习工作了
It's the fact, she now has three of them.

33
00:01:58,687 --> 00:01:59,589
说不准呢  卡塞尔
Yeah, well, you never know, Castle.

34
00:01:59,598 --> 00:02:00,941
这一份可能会以某种方式
This might be the one that brings the two of you

35
00:02:00,951 --> 00:02:02,447
拉近你们俩的关系
closer together somehow.

36
00:02:02,734 --> 00:02:04,394
可能不大  我只期望
I doubt it. The best I could hope for now is,

37
00:02:04,403 --> 00:02:06,062
她能学会屈居他人之下
she learns to become more of an underachiever.

38
00:02:06,072 --> 00:02:08,383
对  你肯定能给她点建议
Yeah. Well, I'm sure you'll be able to give her some tips.

39
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:09,333
情况是...
So...

40
00:02:09,553 --> 00:02:10,867
邻居们听到激烈的打斗声
neighbors heard a hellacious fight,

41
00:02:10,877 --> 00:02:11,903
然后死者
and then our victim here

42
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:13,457
从那扇四层的窗户掉下来
sailed out of that fourth-floor window.

43
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,550
那是他的公寓吗
Was that his apartment?

44
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:16,094
我们在查  可看上去不像
We're checking, but it doesn't look like it.

45
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:18,165
住户们不认识他  他也没有任何证件
Tenants don't recognize him and he doesn't have any I.D.

46
00:02:18,357 --> 00:02:20,601
没证件  可死因有很多
No I.D., but lots of causes of death.

47
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:21,791
你是说除了坠楼
You mean other than gravity?

48
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,807
对
Oh, yeah.

49
00:02:23,363 --> 00:02:24,553
看到那处枪伤吗
See that bullet wound?

50
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:26,538
那他在坠楼前遭枪击
So he was shot before he fell?

51
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:27,612
还挨刀子了
And stabbed.

52
00:02:27,928 --> 00:02:28,926
又遭枪击又挨刀
Shot and stabbed?

53
00:02:28,935 --> 00:02:29,693
还有勒伤
And choked,

54
00:02:29,703 --> 00:02:31,937
脖子一边还插了支铅笔
and has a pencil jammed in the side of his neck.

55
00:02:31,947 --> 00:02:35,054
给"过度杀戮"冠以了的新的定义
Ah. Gives new meaning to the term "overkill."

56
00:02:35,438 --> 00:02:36,924
有人看到攻击他的人吗
Did anyone see his attacker?

57
00:02:36,934 --> 00:02:37,950
我们在询问目击者
Uh, we're checking with witnesses,

58
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,137
但我想凶手应该是趁乱
but I figure that our perp slipped out of the building

59
00:02:40,147 --> 00:02:41,221
溜出楼的
during all the confusion.

60
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,659
好  我们去看看他们的进展
All right. Let's go see what they got.

61
00:02:46,256 --> 00:02:47,138
晚上好  阿丽克西斯
Hey, Alexis.

62
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,274
阿丽克西斯
Alexis?

63
00:02:51,013 --> 00:02:52,125
老爸
Hey, dad.

64
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:53,736
你在这里干什么
What are you doing here?

65
00:02:54,868 --> 00:02:55,510
这...
Is...

66
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,026
这就是你新找的实习
is this your new internship?

67
00:02:57,035 --> 00:02:58,963
帕里什医生同意让我跟着她
Dr. Parish agreed to let me shadow her.

68
00:02:58,973 --> 00:02:59,960
我想  如果我要去医学院
I thought, if I go to med school,

69
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,262
这能让我对法医病理学有更清楚的了解
this will give me a better grasp of forensic pathology.

70
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,487
这两天我就学到了很多
I've learned so much in just two days.

71
00:03:04,497 --> 00:03:05,494
亲爱的
Sweetie...

72
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:07,642
你为什么不告诉我
Why wouldn't you tell me?

73
00:03:07,652 --> 00:03:09,301
我想我是怕你不同意
I guess I was afraid you'd veto it,

74
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:11,104
或许你会觉得我来这里
like maybe you'd think me being here

75
00:03:11,114 --> 00:03:12,658
是在侵犯你的地盘  或者...
was invading your territory or--

76
00:03:12,668 --> 00:03:13,636
什么
What?

77
00:03:14,145 --> 00:03:16,820
太扯了  我怎么可能那么想
That's crazy. I wouldn't... think that.

78
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,741
真是...
That's...

79
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,400
这真是太好了
This is great.

80
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,896
-是啊  -我只是不知
- Yeah. - It's--I just--I don't know

81
00:03:20,906 --> 00:03:23,016
让你目睹犯罪现场和死尸会不会不合适
if you should be exposed to crime scenes and dead bodies.

82
00:03:23,025 --> 00:03:24,138
我已经习惯了
Oh, I'm already used to it.

83
00:03:24,147 --> 00:03:25,835
虽恶心但也很酷
It's equal parts gross and cool.

84
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:28,549
我听到了  我完全赞同你的看法
I heard that and I couldn't agree with you more.

85
00:03:28,684 --> 00:03:30,640
我终于知道你为什么那么喜欢这个了  老爸
I finally get why you're into this, dad.

86
00:03:31,024 --> 00:03:32,280
现在我也喜欢了
Now I'm into it, too.

87
00:03:33,565 --> 00:03:34,515
太好了
That's great.

88
00:03:37,488 --> 00:03:38,466
很好
Great.

89
00:03:39,425 --> 00:03:40,403
我生活的分区相撞了
My worlds are colliding.

90
00:03:40,585 --> 00:03:41,784
你是指阿丽克西斯
You mean Alexis?

91
00:03:41,928 --> 00:03:42,916
你知道这事
You knew about this?

92
00:03:42,925 --> 00:03:44,460
得了吧  卡塞尔  是你自己说
Come on, Castle. You're the one who said you wanted

93
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:46,272
想找办法和她多待会儿的
to find a way of spending more time with her.

94
00:03:46,282 --> 00:03:47,327
不是这种方式
Not like this.

95
00:03:47,596 --> 00:03:48,632
这是我的地盘
This is my thing.

96
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:49,792
我们的地盘
This is our thing.

97
00:03:50,348 --> 00:03:51,758
这是对宗教和国家的侵犯
It's a violation of church and state.

98
00:03:51,768 --> 00:03:54,424
这就好像我去她学校教书
This would be like me just showing up at her school and teaching.

99
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,716
我真的认为你反应有点大
I really think that you're overreacting.

100
00:03:56,726 --> 00:03:57,877
如果没有呢
But what if I'm not?

101
00:03:58,232 --> 00:04:01,550
如果这影响了我们微妙的合作关系呢
What if this upsets the delicate synergy of our partnership?

102
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,391
如果破坏了我们的团队凝聚力呢
What if it undermines our unit cohesion?

103
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:04,791
是吧  是个大问题呢
See? Major problem.

104
00:04:04,801 --> 00:04:07,630
-没说那个  是这个  -地上好多血
- Not that. This. - That's a lot of blood.

105
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,826
有个目击证人看到一个男人离开大楼
One of our witnesses saw a man leaving the building.

106
00:04:09,836 --> 00:04:11,006
他一瘸一拐的
He was limping.

107
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:12,598
嫌犯受伤了
Our suspect was injured.

108
00:04:12,608 --> 00:04:15,072
一路走向那边
And the trail goes that way.

109
00:04:17,336 --> 00:04:20,990
一个残忍的杀手却被自己身体的脆弱出卖了
A brutal killer betrayed by the frailty of his own flesh.

110
00:04:21,114 --> 00:04:24,375
原始血迹泄露了他的行踪
His path revealed by that most primal stain.

111
00:04:25,066 --> 00:04:26,456
但是行迹到此为止
Except the path ends here.

112
00:04:26,878 --> 00:04:28,633
这么多血只滴在一个地方
Multiple drops in one spot?

113
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,724
他一定在这里停留过
He must have stood here for a minute.

114
00:04:31,654 --> 00:04:32,786
他上了车
He got into a car.

115
00:04:34,033 --> 00:04:36,162
如果他上了车  或许会被录下来
Well, if he did, maybe he got caught on tape.

116
00:04:36,814 --> 00:04:38,837
第一通报警电话是8点42分打进来的
The first 9-1-1 call came at 8:42,

117
00:04:38,847 --> 00:04:40,880
就在死者坠楼之后
just after our victim crash landed.

118
00:04:41,494 --> 00:04:44,304
所以凶手可能就在一两分钟后走到了街角
So our guy probably made it to the corner a minute or two later.

119
00:04:44,812 --> 00:04:47,536
阿丽克西斯来实习挺不错啊
Hey. Pretty cool about Alexis' internship.

120
00:04:49,051 --> 00:04:49,981
或许不太好
Or not.

121
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,204
看  那个肯定就是他
There. That's gotta be him.

122
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,477
他受伤了  警察都在追捕他
He's wounded, the cops are after him,

123
00:04:55,486 --> 00:04:56,906
他在找地方藏身
and he's looking for a place to go.

124
00:04:58,699 --> 00:04:59,658
他劫了个人质
He has a hostage.

125
00:05:00,521 --> 00:05:03,178
追踪出租车牌号  查明去向
Track the taxi off the medallion number, find out where it went.

126
00:05:04,962 --> 00:05:07,072
纽约警察  把手举起来
NYPD! Let me see your hands!

127
00:05:07,072 --> 00:05:09,057
-纽约警察  把手举起来  -起来
- NYPD! Hands in the air. - Get up.

128
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:10,140
把手举起来
Show us your hands.

129
00:05:10,323 --> 00:05:11,310
起来  把手举起来
Get up. Hands in the air.

130
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,855
起来  起来
Get up. Get up.

131
00:05:13,612 --> 00:05:14,705
双手抱头
Put your hands on your head.

132
00:05:16,681 --> 00:05:17,928
立即双手抱头
Hands on your head now.

133
00:05:18,705 --> 00:05:19,788
跪下
Drop to your knees.

134
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:28,007
托马斯·盖奇
Thomas Gage.

135
00:05:29,484 --> 00:05:32,007
以备查证  我宣读过你的权利吗
For the record, have I advised you of your rights?

136
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:34,625
读了
Yes.

137
00:05:35,191 --> 00:05:37,032
包括你请律师的权利
Including your right to an attorney?

138
00:05:38,413 --> 00:05:39,286
我不需要
I won't need one.

139
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:43,352
你认识这个人吗
Do you recognize this man?

140
00:05:45,807 --> 00:05:47,303
看来他摔得很惨
Looks like he took a nasty fall.

141
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,809
是有人推了他一把
Well, he had a little help.

142
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:52,396
指纹能证明他是被人扔出窗外
Fingerprint evidence will show that he was thrown out a window

143
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,518
被你扔出窗外
by you.

144
00:05:53,873 --> 00:05:54,803
事后
After which,

145
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:58,140
监控摄像头将你绑架蒂娜·马赛的过程尽收眼底
you kidnapped Tina Massey in full view of a security camera.

146
00:05:58,342 --> 00:05:59,387
杀人  外加绑架
Murder, plus kidnapping,

147
00:05:59,397 --> 00:06:01,708
你得死在大牢里了
that equals more years in prison than you have left.

148
00:06:02,657 --> 00:06:03,914
除非你肯合作
Unless you cooperate.

149
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:11,500
你们掌握的有关我的证据
Everything that you have on me...

150
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,754
或是你们以为有的证据
Or you think you have...

151
00:06:14,962 --> 00:06:16,055
都会消失无踪
It's all going away.

152
00:06:18,664 --> 00:06:19,632
我说完了
And we're done here.

153
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:24,917
这家伙应该吓得汗如雨下
This guy should be sweating bullets.

154
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,279
感觉很不对
This doesn't feel right.

155
00:06:26,336 --> 00:06:27,746
就好像他知道我们不知道的事
It's like he knows something we don't.

156
00:06:27,756 --> 00:06:30,287
尽力去查出托马斯·盖奇的所有资料
I want you to pull everything you can on Thomas Gage.

157
00:06:30,297 --> 00:06:32,158
问题是  这不是他的真名
The problem is, that's not his real name.

158
00:06:32,311 --> 00:06:33,491
他的驾照是伪造的
His driver's license is bogus,

159
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,795
系统里也没他的指纹
and his prints aren't in the system.

160
00:06:34,805 --> 00:06:37,567
总之  我们对此人一无所知
Bottom line is, we have no idea who this man is.

161
00:06:41,873 --> 00:06:43,656
整个过程中他一直非常冷静
The guy was super calm the whole time.

162
00:06:43,714 --> 00:06:45,277
话也不多
Not big on chitchat either.

163
00:06:45,402 --> 00:06:46,418
他的开场白是
His opening line was,

164
00:06:46,428 --> 00:06:48,135
"滚进出租车  不然就毙了你"
"Get your ass in the cab, or I'll kill you."

165
00:06:48,193 --> 00:06:49,746
那你们回到你的公寓之后呢
And what about when you went back to your apartment,

166
00:06:49,756 --> 00:06:50,590
他说什么了
what did he talk about?

167
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,134
他保证会留我一命之后
After he promised not to murder me,

168
00:06:52,144 --> 00:06:53,774
就让我包扎他的腿
he asked me to patch up his leg.

169
00:06:53,861 --> 00:06:55,222
他腿上有条很深的伤口
He had a real gash.

170
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,083
你能看出来他是怎么伤的吗
Could you tell how he got the injury?

171
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,800
他说他在行凶杀人时
He said he got slashed with a knife

172
00:06:59,442 --> 00:07:00,718
被对方用刀砍伤
while he was killing a guy.

173
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:02,597
他就这么供认不讳
And he admitted that to you?

174
00:07:02,636 --> 00:07:04,237
更像是陈述事实
More like just made the statement.

175
00:07:04,611 --> 00:07:06,961
他有没有说那人是谁
And did he say who this guy was

176
00:07:06,971 --> 00:07:08,400
或者他为什么杀他
or why he killed him?

177
00:07:08,467 --> 00:07:11,181
他就只跟我说  这个人不存在
All he told me was that the man doesn't exist.

178
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:14,528
这个人不存在
The man doesn't exist

179
00:07:14,538 --> 00:07:15,803
至少我查不到
as far as I can tell.

180
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:17,098
那你还没查到他的身份
So you haven't I.D.'ed him yet?

181
00:07:17,108 --> 00:07:19,707
我试了  但所有数据库都查不到他的指纹
Look, I'm trying, but his fingerprints aren't in any database,

182
00:07:19,716 --> 00:07:20,263
这点很奇怪
which is weird,

183
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,219
因为我以为他一定会有犯罪记录呢
because I thought for sure he'd have a criminal record.

184
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:22,881
为什么
How come?

185
00:07:22,891 --> 00:07:24,636
他不是第一次身负多伤了
It's not the first time this guy has mixed it up--

186
00:07:24,646 --> 00:07:25,768
身上有多处旧枪伤
old gunshot wounds,

187
00:07:25,777 --> 00:07:27,523
手上有习武结下的厚茧
callused hands from martial arts training,

188
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:29,307
断过的骨头比柯受良还多
more broken bones than Evel Knievel.

189
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:30,918
看他拍的片子吓死你
You're not gonna believe his x-rays.

190
00:07:35,502 --> 00:07:36,691
我的无名尸哪去了
Where is my John Doe?

191
00:07:39,386 --> 00:07:40,547
尸体呢
Where is my John Doe?

192
00:07:41,717 --> 00:07:43,184
我走的时候还在这儿呢
He was right there when I left.

193
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:44,651
我就出去了一小会
I-I was only gone a minute.

194
00:07:44,661 --> 00:07:46,176
我知道他刚刚还在
I know he was right there.

195
00:07:46,186 --> 00:07:47,845
我正打算给他开膛破肚呢
I was just about to cut him open.

196
00:07:47,931 --> 00:07:50,808
现在他可真是不存在了
Well, now he really doesn't exist.

197
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,513
一具尸体怎么会从停尸间里凭空消失呢
How does a body just vanish from a morgue?

198
00:07:53,523 --> 00:07:55,738
不知道  但托马斯·盖奇有这个本事
I don't know, but Thomas Gage does.

199
00:07:55,747 --> 00:07:56,476
还记得他曾说过
Remember what he said--

200
00:07:56,486 --> 00:07:58,174
你以为你掌握的证据都会消失无踪
Whatever you think you have is going away?

201
00:07:58,548 --> 00:07:59,612
这事他也有份
He's in on this.

202
00:07:59,641 --> 00:08:01,780
埃斯波  盖奇转移去扣押中心了吗
Espo, did Gage get transferred to Central Booking yet?

203
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:02,931
没  他还关在我们这儿
No, he's still in holding.

204
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,302
他得给我们老实交代
He's gonna give us some answers.

205
00:08:10,363 --> 00:08:11,380
他跑哪去了
Where the hell is this guy?

206
00:08:15,676 --> 00:08:16,914
之前还在  我
He was here. I-I--

207
00:08:16,923 --> 00:08:18,304
我亲自锁的他
I secured him myself.

208
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:21,459
封锁分局
Lock down the precinct.

209
00:08:21,555 --> 00:08:22,486
好的  马上
All right. Move.

210
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,900
灵书妙探
第四季 第十五集

211
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,982
老爸
Hey, Dad.

212
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:37,223
我昨晚想等你来着  但你回来得好晚
I tried to wait up, but you must have gotten in really late.

213
00:08:37,223 --> 00:08:39,717
身不由己啊  嫌犯离奇失踪
Not by choice. Our suspect pulled a Houdini,

214
00:08:39,717 --> 00:08:41,913
所以他们封锁了整个警局
so they locked down the entire station.

215
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,889
但那时  化名为托马斯·盖奇的
But by then, the mysterious steely killer,

216
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:46,363
神秘的冷血杀手
going by the nom de guerre of Thomas Gage,

217
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:47,811
早就不知所踪了
was long gone.

218
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:49,988
我要给这案子做笔记
I'm writing up notes on this case.

219
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,715
这可是我下本书的绝佳题材啊
Solid-gold material for my next book.

220
00:08:51,715 --> 00:08:53,652
等等  那个把无名氏扔出窗外的人吗
Wait. The guy who threw John Doe out the window,

221
00:08:53,652 --> 00:08:54,131
他逃走了
he escaped?

222
00:08:54,131 --> 00:08:56,491
不过那是在他
Uh-huh, but only after

223
00:08:56,491 --> 00:08:59,569
精心策划将无名尸偷出停尸间之后
orchestrating the theft of John Doe's body from the morgue.

224
00:08:59,934 --> 00:09:00,768
这个情节多妙啊
How awesome is that?

225
00:09:00,768 --> 00:09:02,801
对那个失职让尸体被窃的人不怎么妙
Not so awesome if you're the person who let it happen.

226
00:09:02,868 --> 00:09:04,019
宝贝  不是你的责任
Oh, honey, it's not your fault.

227
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:06,100
当时我守着尸体  一个朋友来电话
I was with that body, but a friend called,

228
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,462
我就去一边聊天了  我没
and I stepped away to talk. I didn't--

229
00:09:07,462 --> 00:09:09,476
好了  先听我说
Okay, hang on. Listen to me.

230
00:09:09,725 --> 00:09:11,624
我很欣慰你当时不在
I'm glad you weren't there

231
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:14,175
因为会偷走尸体的人
because the kind of person who took John Doe's body

232
00:09:14,175 --> 00:09:16,084
肯定也会毫不犹豫地
is the kind of person who wouldn't think twice

233
00:09:16,084 --> 00:09:17,714
对妨碍他的人痛下杀手
about hurting whoever got in the way.

234
00:09:17,935 --> 00:09:19,728
我还以为跟法医一起工作
Still, I thought working with Dr. Parish,

235
00:09:19,728 --> 00:09:21,349
绝对不会发生由于我的失误
there'd be zero chance I'd make a mistake

236
00:09:21,349 --> 00:09:22,519
而影响到病人的事件
that would affect a patient.

237
00:09:22,682 --> 00:09:24,514
毕竟  这怎么可能呢
I mean, how could I, right?

238
00:09:24,993 --> 00:09:26,000
可我还是搞砸了
Well, I found a way.

239
00:09:26,777 --> 00:09:28,062
宝贝  知道吗
Y-you know, honey,

240
00:09:28,695 --> 00:09:31,428
如果这份实习的工作不那么合适的话
if this internship isn't the right fit,

241
00:09:31,937 --> 00:09:33,903
我相信蕾妮会谅解的
I'm sure Lanie would understand.

242
00:09:33,903 --> 00:09:34,737
不行
No.

243
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,722
既然帕里什医生给了我这个机会
Dr. Parish gave me this opportunity,

244
00:09:36,722 --> 00:09:38,123
我就不能半途而废
and I want to see it through.

245
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:42,448
如何
Well?

246
00:09:43,062 --> 00:09:44,989
我们认为无名氏遇害的公寓
The apartment where John Doe was killed,

247
00:09:44,989 --> 00:09:46,495
是托马斯·盖奇之前居住的地方
we think thomas gage was squatting there.

248
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,953
-结果  -我不管盖奇曾经住在哪
- Turns-- - I don't care where Gage was

249
00:09:47,953 --> 00:09:50,015
除非这能告诉我他现在在哪
unless it tells me where he is now.

250
00:09:50,063 --> 00:09:51,616
但我也很想知道
But I'm very interested in knowing

251
00:09:51,616 --> 00:09:53,851
他是怎么在你们眼皮子底下从牢房溜出去的
how he got out of that holding cell on your watch.

252
00:09:54,819 --> 00:09:56,277
长官  目前我们也不清楚
We're not clear on that, Sir.

253
00:09:56,277 --> 00:09:58,397
但我们知道他是怎么离开分局的
But we do know how he left this precinct.

254
00:09:58,675 --> 00:10:01,197
我猜他是从后门偷溜的
I assume he snuck out of the back exit.

255
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:05,254
其实他是从正门大摇大摆出去的
Actually, he went out through the front door.

256
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,229
这张照片是他往大堂走时拍下的
This is him heading to the lobby.

257
00:10:10,538 --> 00:10:12,351
他从哪弄到的警服
Where did this man get a uniform?

258
00:10:12,523 --> 00:10:14,604
从更衣室偷的
He stole it from the locker room.

259
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,203
查查他还干了什么
Find out what else he did.

260
00:10:17,213 --> 00:10:19,668
去查监控录像  追查他的一举一动
Check our security video and retrace his steps.

261
00:10:19,668 --> 00:10:21,423
我要知道他都做了什么
I want to know every move that he made.

262
00:10:21,423 --> 00:10:22,258
遵命
Okay.

263
00:10:23,677 --> 00:10:26,075
盖奇总是走在我们前面
Gage has been two steps ahead of us this whole time.

264
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,830
不仅如此  他一定还有其他同伙
Not only that, but he must have a partner

265
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,268
才能从停尸间把尸体偷走
who took John Doe from the morgue.

266
00:10:29,268 --> 00:10:31,896
这些还是解释不了他为什么要穿上警服
Which still doesn't explain why he ended up wearing those blues.

267
00:10:33,402 --> 00:10:34,974
何必冒险偷警服呢
Why risk stealing a uniform

268
00:10:34,974 --> 00:10:36,749
他明明可以就那么走出警局
when he could've just walked out of the building?

269
00:10:36,749 --> 00:10:39,424
我知道原因  因为他要在分局里找些东西
I'll tell you why. He needed something inside our precinct.

270
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,170
他入侵了我们的数据库
The guy got into our database.

271
00:10:42,637 --> 00:10:44,555
-找什么东西  -不是找东西
- Looking for what? - Not what.

272
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:45,725
而是找人
Who.

273
00:10:49,322 --> 00:10:50,933
皇后区的特雷西·麦格拉
Tracy McGrath of Queens.

274
00:10:51,499 --> 00:10:53,167
他搜索了她  我想我知道他找什么
He ran her name, and I think I know why.

275
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:54,520
她的住址没登记
Her address is unlisted.

276
00:10:54,932 --> 00:10:57,262
如果落网只是盖奇计划的一部分呢
What if getting arrested was part of Gage's plan?

277
00:10:57,262 --> 00:11:00,044
这样他就可以入侵数据库查到特雷西的地址了
So he could access our data for Tracy's address.

278
00:11:00,725 --> 00:11:02,518
伙计们  尽力搜索有关特雷西的资料
All right, you guys pull up everything you can on Tracy.

279
00:11:02,518 --> 00:11:03,909
我跟卡塞尔这就去看看
Castle and I will go over there now.

280
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:04,762
好
Okay.

281
00:11:07,237 --> 00:11:08,972
她的手机直接转到语音信箱了
Her phone's going straight to voice mail.

282
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:11,389
她跟这一切有什么关联
What is her connection to all this?

283
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,000
盖奇为何对她这么有兴趣
Why is Gage so interested in her?

284
00:11:13,183 --> 00:11:15,273
如果幸运  她或许知道盖奇的真实身份
With any luck, she knows who Gage really is.

285
00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:26,350
特雷西·麦格拉
Tracy McGrath?

286
00:11:27,185 --> 00:11:28,316
纽约警局
NYPD.

287
00:11:33,332 --> 00:11:34,176
卡塞尔
Castle.

288
00:11:43,364 --> 00:11:45,780
埃斯波  我们来晚了
Espo, yeah, we got here too late.

289
00:11:46,432 --> 00:11:48,542
她后脑中了一枪
Uh, she's got one to the back of the head.

290
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,739
你通知一下蕾妮  让她把鉴证组也带来
Can you call Lanie and get her to bring C.S.U. down here?

291
00:11:51,055 --> 00:11:52,474
好  我着手办
Yeah. I'm on it.

292
00:11:53,232 --> 00:11:54,172
盖茨警监
Captain Gates,

293
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,253
特雷西·麦格拉也被盖奇杀害了
looks like Tracy McGRrath was Gage's next victim.

294
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,308
我们掌握她什么情况
What do we know about her?

295
00:11:57,308 --> 00:11:59,025
她33岁  没有亲人
Well, she's 33, no family.

296
00:11:59,025 --> 00:12:00,818
是研究基金会的一位科学家
A scientist at a research foundation.

297
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:02,391
好  找她的同事问话
All right. Talk to her coworkers.

298
00:12:02,391 --> 00:12:04,347
查明盖奇为什么要置她于死地
Find out why Gage would've wanted her dead.

299
00:12:06,361 --> 00:12:07,857
看来她死了有一阵子了
Looks like she's been here a while.

300
00:12:08,049 --> 00:12:09,373
这一点也不稀奇
Yeah, well, it makes sense.

301
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,773
盖奇昨晚就逃跑了
Gage escaped last night.

302
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:12,259
动作比我们快了10个小时
He had a 10-hour lead on us.

303
00:12:13,123 --> 00:12:13,880
你留在原地
You stay put.

304
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,386
我去看看屋里其他地方
I'm gonna check the rest of the place.

305
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,035
卡塞尔
Castle...

306
00:12:52,569 --> 00:12:53,692
人都去哪了
Where is everybody?

307
00:12:54,008 --> 00:12:55,849
我们通常会先于警员到达现场
We usually beat the uniforms to the scenes.

308
00:12:55,849 --> 00:12:58,132
他们总不想急匆匆地来然后傻站着
It's not like they want to hurry and stand around.

309
00:12:58,266 --> 00:13:00,721
这次我不会让死者再离开我的视线了
Just so you know, I'm not letting this victim out of my sight.

310
00:13:00,721 --> 00:13:02,534
-真荒唐  -怎么了
- Crazy. - What is?

311
00:13:02,534 --> 00:13:03,886
像理查德·卡塞尔那样
The fact that Richard Castle,

312
00:13:03,886 --> 00:13:05,775
从不会内疚自责的人
a man unburdened by regret and guilt,

313
00:13:05,775 --> 00:13:07,885
怎么会有一个责任心这么强的女儿
has a child that carries the weight of the world.

314
00:13:07,885 --> 00:13:10,628
那具尸体消失了不是你的责任
It is not on you that a dead man came up missing.

315
00:13:11,031 --> 00:13:13,103
那样的事多久发生一次
Well, how often does something like that happen anyway?

316
00:13:13,103 --> 00:13:16,123
从未发生过  所以别担心  这事很怪
It never happens, honey. So relax. It was a freak thing.

317
00:13:16,123 --> 00:13:17,821
尸体不会不翼而飞的
Bodies just don't disappear.

318
00:13:19,864 --> 00:13:21,024
贝克特探长
Detective Beckett?

319
00:13:21,561 --> 00:13:22,779
贝克特探长
Detective Beckett.

320
00:13:25,292 --> 00:13:27,411
好吧  我看见血迹了
Okay, I see where the blood stain is.

321
00:13:28,869 --> 00:13:30,049
尸体呢
Where is the body?

322
00:13:34,048 --> 00:13:34,758
你没事吧
You okay?

323
00:13:34,758 --> 00:13:35,774
没事  你呢
Yeah. You?

324
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:38,488
你是什么人
Who are you?

325
00:13:40,378 --> 00:13:41,883
要带我们去哪里
Where the hell are you taking us?

326
00:13:45,048 --> 00:13:46,122
无论是哪儿
Wherever it is...

327
00:13:46,122 --> 00:13:47,494
是在地下很深处
It's way down.

328
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:01,572
这究竟是什么地方
What is this place?

329
00:14:05,562 --> 00:14:07,049
不知道  一头雾水
I don't know. I have no idea.

330
00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:09,600
里克·卡塞尔也有词穷的时候
Rick Castle at a loss for words?

331
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:12,630
破天荒头一遭吧
That must be a first for you.

332
00:14:14,951 --> 00:14:16,322
索菲亚·特纳
Sophia Turner?

333
00:14:17,828 --> 00:14:18,845
你好  里克
Hello, Rick.

334
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,118
欢迎来到中情局
Welcome to the CIA.

335
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:25,165
对  是她
Yeah, that's her.

336
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,435
特雷西已经在牛顿基金会为我工作五年了
Tracy's worked for me at the Newton foundation for five years.

337
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,238
昨天我还和她说过话
I just talked to her yesterday.

338
00:14:30,344 --> 00:14:32,770
我们争论雪佛兰古董车的优点
We debated the merits of the Chevy Corvair.

339
00:14:33,422 --> 00:14:35,148
她喜欢古典车
She's a classic car buff.

340
00:14:35,973 --> 00:14:36,846
生前喜欢
She was.

341
00:14:37,517 --> 00:14:39,263
特雷西到底负责什么工作
And what kind of work did Tracy do exactly?

342
00:14:40,097 --> 00:14:42,178
不会招来杀身之祸的工作  你是这意思吗
It wouldn't get you killed, if that's what you're asking.

343
00:14:42,447 --> 00:14:44,931
特雷西拥有应用数学的博士学位
Tracy had a PhD in applied mathematics.

344
00:14:45,094 --> 00:14:46,935
她研发统计模型
She'd been developing statistical models

345
00:14:46,935 --> 00:14:49,007
以预测气候变化的影响
to predict the affects of climate change.

346
00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:50,397
她有树敌吗
Did she have any enemies,

347
00:14:50,397 --> 00:14:51,922
有没有人会对她不利
anybody who might want to do her harm?

348
00:14:51,922 --> 00:14:53,111
就我所知没有
None that I know of.

349
00:14:53,543 --> 00:14:54,473
等等
Hold on.

350
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:56,094
昨天有件奇怪事
There was something, yesterday.

351
00:14:56,094 --> 00:14:59,949
她大概下午三点突然离开办公室
Uh, she left the office rather suddenly, about 3:00.

352
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:02,750
她没跟我打招呼  就那么消失了两个小时
She didn't check in with me. She was just gone for two hours.

353
00:15:03,363 --> 00:15:04,572
那可不是她的风格
That wasn't like her.

354
00:15:05,186 --> 00:15:06,653
你知道她去了哪里吗
Do you have any idea where she went?

355
00:15:06,653 --> 00:15:08,034
不知道  我问她时
No, and when I asked,

356
00:15:08,034 --> 00:15:09,808
她似乎不想说
she didn't seem to want to tell me.

357
00:15:10,211 --> 00:15:11,755
我们要查看她的电脑
We're gonna need access to her computer,

358
00:15:11,755 --> 00:15:13,644
电邮  文档等一切资料
her e-mails, her documents, everything.

359
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,179
全在我们的服务器里
It's all on our server.

360
00:15:15,783 --> 00:15:17,356
我在这里就可以登录
I can log into there from here.

361
00:15:18,181 --> 00:15:20,022
秘密地下总部
Secret underground headquarters?

362
00:15:20,022 --> 00:15:21,863
和007电影有得一拼
This is straight out of James Bond.

363
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,469
卡塞尔  你在回避问题
Castle, you're avoiding the question.

364
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:27,742
索菲亚·特纳是什么人  你怎么认识她的
Who's Sophia Turner? How do you know her?

365
00:15:27,915 --> 00:15:29,900
说来话长
Uh, it's a... long story.

366
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,329
那你就长话短说吧
Well, I'll take the short version.

367
00:15:31,444 --> 00:15:32,643
还是我来揭谜底吧
Let me give it to you.

368
00:15:33,803 --> 00:15:34,973
已经有
What has it been,

369
00:15:35,424 --> 00:15:36,057
十二年了吧
12 years?

370
00:15:36,057 --> 00:15:37,141
十一年半
11 and a half.

371
00:15:38,224 --> 00:15:40,440
我们是里克为他的第一本德里克·斯道姆小说
Rick and I met when he was just beginning to do research

372
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,252
做调研的时认识的
on his first Derrick Storm novel.

373
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:45,686
他想近距离亲身观察
He wanted an up-close-and-personal look

374
00:15:45,686 --> 00:15:47,556
中情局女特工的生活
at the life of a female CIA agent.

375
00:15:48,812 --> 00:15:50,011
所以我就让他如愿了
So I gave him one.

376
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,341
你就是克莱拉·斯瑞克
You're Clara Strike,

377
00:15:56,341 --> 00:15:58,863
德里克·斯道姆系列小说里的克莱拉·斯瑞克
the Clara Strike from the Derrick Storm books?

378
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,021
我不敢肯定自己就是克莱拉·斯瑞克
I wouldn't say that I am Clara Strike,

379
00:16:01,021 --> 00:16:05,337
但我想我还是给了里克一些灵感
but I'd like to think that I inspired Rick in some small way.

380
00:16:06,478 --> 00:16:08,473
真是太有意思了
Well, that is just fascinating.

381
00:16:08,789 --> 00:16:10,045
-气色不错呀  -你也是
- You look good. - You, too.

382
00:16:10,045 --> 00:16:11,983
我不想打扰你们老友重聚
Okay, so I hate to interrupt this reunion,

383
00:16:11,983 --> 00:16:14,371
但是我们被非法扣留了
but we're being illegally detained,

384
00:16:14,371 --> 00:16:15,598
至少我是不情愿的
at least I am.

385
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:17,094
不是扣留
This is not a detention.

386
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,837
而是任务报告  纽约警局批准的
This is a debriefing, approved by the NYPD.

387
00:16:20,288 --> 00:16:21,870
欢迎打给泰德·麦奎因核实
Feel free to call Ted McQuinn.

388
00:16:22,043 --> 00:16:23,338
你是说警部
The chief of detectives?

389
00:16:23,386 --> 00:16:25,534
他向我保证你会全力配合
He assured me you'd give us your full cooperation.

390
00:16:25,534 --> 00:16:27,797
请告诉我你掌握的托马斯·盖奇的一切情况
I need to know everything you know about Thomas Gage.

391
00:16:28,027 --> 00:16:30,674
不  你得先跟我说清楚到底是什么情况
No. Not until you tell me what the hell is going on here.

392
00:16:33,734 --> 00:16:34,626
好吧
Fine.

393
00:16:35,191 --> 00:16:36,179
不过这会涉及到
But that would be getting into

394
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:39,766
事关国家安全的高度机密
highly classified information regarding national security,

395
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:41,483
如果你泄露此机密
which, if you were to reveal it to anyone,

396
00:16:41,483 --> 00:16:42,979
将被裁定为
would be considered a treasonable offense

397
00:16:42,979 --> 00:16:44,696
叛国罪
against the United States of America,

398
00:16:44,696 --> 00:16:46,182
并会被判处死刑
punishable by death.

399
00:16:46,508 --> 00:16:48,445
那么  你还想知道吗
So... you still want to know?

400
00:16:51,073 --> 00:16:54,833
托马斯·盖奇于97年从海豹突击第6分队招至麾下
We recruited Thomas Gage out of seal team six in 1997.

401
00:16:54,957 --> 00:16:58,132
机智  训练有素  精通11种语言
Smart, highly trained, fluent in 11 languages,

402
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,309
他曾是我们的王牌特工
Gage was our most effective asset.

403
00:17:00,491 --> 00:17:03,512
我们派他去世界各地的冲突地区和国家
We sent him into conflict zones, failed states all over the world.

404
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,449
盖奇能处理好任何情况
Gage was adept in every situation.

405
00:17:05,727 --> 00:17:08,365
不幸的是  他变节了
Unfortunately, he went rogue.

406
00:17:09,391 --> 00:17:10,772
根据国家安全局拦截的情报
Based on N.S.A. intercepts,

407
00:17:10,772 --> 00:17:13,620
我们相信盖奇试图发动一起灾难性事件
we believe that Gage is trying to initiate a catastrophic event,

408
00:17:13,649 --> 00:17:15,701
这对国家安全构成紧迫威胁
which poses an imminent threat to the country.

409
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,488
这么说
So...

410
00:17:16,488 --> 00:17:19,988
被盖奇推出窗外的男子  是中情局特工
That man that Gage pushed out the window, he was CIA.

411
00:17:20,074 --> 00:17:21,599
加里·哈勃  顶尖特工之一
Gary Harper. One of our best.

412
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,134
我们掌握了盖奇的踪迹
We got a tip on Gage's whereabouts.

413
00:17:23,134 --> 00:17:24,467
派哈勃将其逮捕
We sent Harper to bring him in.

414
00:17:24,467 --> 00:17:26,903
显然  行动失败了
Obviously, that operation didn't go as planned.

415
00:17:27,152 --> 00:17:29,885
之后  是你们从停尸间偷走了尸体
At which point, you took the body from the morgue.

416
00:17:29,885 --> 00:17:32,427
这可是国家安全危机
This is a national security crisis.

417
00:17:32,753 --> 00:17:34,661
我们可不希望纽约警局碍手碍脚
We didn't want the NYPD underfoot.

418
00:17:34,661 --> 00:17:35,688
很高兴知道这点
Well, good to know.

419
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:37,615
你们是怎么调查到特雷西·麦格拉的
So how did you guys get on to Tracy McGrath?

420
00:17:37,615 --> 00:17:39,543
我们监控了你们分局的数据
We monitored data from your precinct.

421
00:17:39,543 --> 00:17:40,982
发现了此人  但不幸的是
Her name came up, but unfortunately,

422
00:17:40,982 --> 00:17:43,072
特工赶到时  她已经遇害了
by the time our agent got there, she was already dead.

423
00:17:43,072 --> 00:17:44,348
盖奇为什么要杀她
So why did Gage kill her?

424
00:17:44,444 --> 00:17:45,863
我们希望你知道呢
We were hoping you would know.

425
00:17:46,976 --> 00:17:48,107
你可以接电话
You can go ahead and answer that.

426
00:17:48,107 --> 00:17:49,364
我没打算不接
Yeah, I was planning on it.

427
00:17:49,881 --> 00:17:51,665
介意用免提接听吗
Would you mind terribly putting it on speaker?

428
00:17:53,727 --> 00:17:54,907
埃斯波  免提开着
Espo, you're on speaker.

429
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,765
警部发下话来
Yeah, so, word came down from chief of D's.

430
00:17:57,765 --> 00:18:00,258
他说你在实行什么特殊任务
He said you were on some kind of special assignment.

431
00:18:00,258 --> 00:18:01,265
这是怎么回事
What's that about?

432
00:18:02,876 --> 00:18:03,951
说来话长
Uh, it's a long story.

433
00:18:03,951 --> 00:18:05,610
特雷西·麦格拉方面有什么进展
What do you got on Tracy McGrath?

434
00:18:05,638 --> 00:18:06,377
可能与案子无关
It may be nothing,

435
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:08,142
她昨天曾翘班两个小时
but she ditched work yesterday for two hours.

436
00:18:08,142 --> 00:18:09,638
她的日程安排上作了记号
She has a notation in her day planner,

437
00:18:09,638 --> 00:18:11,920
只写了"潘朵拉"
but all it says is "Pandora."

438
00:18:13,311 --> 00:18:14,606
我等下打给你
You know what? Let me get back to you.

439
00:18:15,641 --> 00:18:16,677
"潘朵拉"是什么
What's Pandora?

440
00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:20,705
据我们所知
According to the chatter,

441
00:18:20,705 --> 00:18:23,362
"潘朵拉"是盖奇任务的代号
Pandora is the code name for Gage's mission,

442
00:18:23,515 --> 00:18:26,191
就是说这位麦格拉女士也牵涉其中
which means that the McGrath woman is mixed up in it.

443
00:18:26,191 --> 00:18:28,205
我们掌握的情况已全数告知
Now the two of you know as much as we do.

444
00:18:28,205 --> 00:18:30,257
在这个案件上  你的表现很出色
Look, you have done impressive work on this case.

445
00:18:30,305 --> 00:18:32,434
我要你负责搜捕托马斯·盖奇的行动
I want you to take the lead in finding Thomas Gage.

446
00:18:32,434 --> 00:18:33,153
索菲亚
Sophia--

447
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,388
马丁  我们已经无计可施了
Martin, we are up against the wall.

448
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,112
中情局被禁止进行国内调查
The CIA is barred from domestic investigation.

449
00:18:38,112 --> 00:18:39,617
这种情况不是该联调局出手吗
Well, isn't that what the FBI is for?

450
00:18:39,617 --> 00:18:40,902
托马斯·盖奇是幕前棋子
Thomas Gage is a hired gun.

451
00:18:40,902 --> 00:18:43,799
我们不知道他受雇于谁  牵涉有多深
We don't know who he works for or how deep this goes.

452
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:47,251
我希望你继续调查此案
All I am asking is that you continue your investigation,

453
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,946
我们得到他的情报会跟你们共享
and we will share all information we get on him.

454
00:18:50,157 --> 00:18:51,423
有什么条件
And what's the catch?

455
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:52,516
礼尚往来
That you do the same,

456
00:18:52,526 --> 00:18:53,849
而且你只向我汇报
and that you report only to me.

457
00:18:53,849 --> 00:18:55,135
此事只能你知我知
This has to stay between us.

458
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:57,081
技术人员已经在你们手机里安装了程序
Our techs have uploaded icons on both your phones,

459
00:18:57,081 --> 00:18:58,971
可以直接连线我的电话
which will connect you to my direct line.

460
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,649
你们也看到盖奇的手段了
You've seen what Gage is capable of.

461
00:19:00,649 --> 00:19:02,251
他是我们最危险的特工之一
He's one of our most dangerous operatives,

462
00:19:02,251 --> 00:19:04,562
我毫不怀疑  无论他在计划什么
and I have no doubt that, whatever he is planning,

463
00:19:04,629 --> 00:19:07,142
他完全有能力使之成为事实
he is completely capable of carrying out.

464
00:19:08,504 --> 00:19:10,124
我也不想让你身处险境
I wouldn't put you in this position,

465
00:19:10,642 --> 00:19:12,234
但必须有人来阻止他
but this man has to be stopped.

466
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,888
我可以寄希望于你们的帮助吗
Can I count on you for your help?

467
00:19:15,907 --> 00:19:17,317
可以
Yes.

468
00:19:27,402 --> 00:19:29,829
你意识到这代表着什么吗
Do you realize what this means?

469
00:19:29,829 --> 00:19:31,200
我们成了特工
We're spies.

470
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,831
这就好像是《谍影重重》
This is like being in a Jason Bourne movie,

471
00:19:32,831 --> 00:19:35,228
只是变节特工是反派  中情局成了好人
only he's the bad guy, and the CIA are the good guys.

472
00:19:35,228 --> 00:19:37,367
-言之尚早  -对了
- That remains to be seen. - Ooh, wait.

473
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:41,634
我得看看他们装的直通电话符号
I've gotta see those direct-dial icons they put on our phones.

474
00:19:43,524 --> 00:19:46,545
为什么我的是个紧急按钮
Hey. Why is mine a panic button?

475
00:19:46,842 --> 00:19:48,693
看来她真的非常了解你
I guess she really does know you well.

476
00:19:49,345 --> 00:19:50,285
好吧
Okay.

477
00:19:50,285 --> 00:19:51,503
-你生气了  -我没生气
- You're upset. - I'm not upset.

478
00:19:51,503 --> 00:19:52,261
那你是怎么了
Then what are you?

479
00:19:52,261 --> 00:19:54,534
我只是对新的指挥架构
I am just a little bit uncomfortable

480
00:19:54,534 --> 00:19:56,557
有点小情绪
with the new command structure.

481
00:19:56,557 --> 00:19:58,792
我不喜欢对警局手足隐瞒秘密
I don't like keeping secrets from my own people.

482
00:19:58,792 --> 00:20:00,365
你确定和索菲亚无关吗
You're sure this isn't about Sophia?

483
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,554
是的  关她什么事
No, why would it be?

484
00:20:01,554 --> 00:20:02,072
我不知道
Oh, I don't know.

485
00:20:02,072 --> 00:20:03,712
可能是因为我拿她做了人物原型
Maybe because I based a character on her.

486
00:20:03,712 --> 00:20:04,978
少自作多情了  卡塞尔
Oh, don't flatter yourself, Castle.

487
00:20:04,978 --> 00:20:06,196
那又不是多大的荣誉
It's not that big an honor.

488
00:20:06,196 --> 00:20:08,488
好极了  因为索菲亚和我们同一战线
Good, because Sophia is on our side.

489
00:20:08,488 --> 00:20:09,466
我们在同一阵营里
We're on the same team.

490
00:20:09,466 --> 00:20:10,665
而你对此毫不担忧
And that doesn't concern you?

491
00:20:10,665 --> 00:20:14,376
不觉得这会破坏团队凝聚力吗
You don't think that that will undermine our unit cohesion?

492
00:20:14,424 --> 00:20:16,208
为了国家安全着想
Hey, I am willing to let that slide

493
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,749
我就不计较那些了
in the interest of national security.

494
00:20:20,591 --> 00:20:22,240
我也一样
Yeah, well, I guess I am, too.

495
00:20:25,232 --> 00:20:27,064
只是当我发现你还和
It's just, I might have been a little bit taken aback

496
00:20:27,064 --> 00:20:28,944
其他人一起做研究...
to find out that you had...

497
00:20:28,944 --> 00:20:31,025
有点吃惊罢了
researched with someone else.

498
00:20:32,425 --> 00:20:36,185
我和她之间的关系跟咱俩之间是不一样的
Look, it was never the way it is with you and me.

499
00:20:36,185 --> 00:20:38,208
我只是跟着她混了一段时间
I just hung out with her for a while

500
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,798
为了使克莱拉·斯瑞克更真实些
to lend some authenticity to Clara Strike.

501
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:43,972
很久之前的事了  持续时间很短
It was a brief moment a long time ago.

502
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,929
再说了  妮基·希特
And besides, Nikki Heat

503
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:48,921
可是个比其更复杂
is a far more complex and...

504
00:20:48,921 --> 00:20:50,762
更微妙的人物
nuanced character.

505
00:20:50,762 --> 00:20:51,865
真的
She is.

506
00:20:51,865 --> 00:20:54,138
而我的写作经验也更丰富了
And I'm a far more experienced writer,

507
00:20:54,522 --> 00:20:55,989
风格更加成熟
more mature.

508
00:20:57,168 --> 00:20:58,760
忽悠过头了
One out of two is...

509
00:20:58,808 --> 00:21:01,024
你跟她混了多久
So how long did the two of you hang out?

510
00:21:03,978 --> 00:21:04,850
一年
A year?

511
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:07,075
那叫持续时间很短吗
That's your idea of a brief moment?

512
00:21:07,075 --> 00:21:09,320
我那时初出茅庐  有很多东西需要她教
I was young, and she had a lot to teach me.

513
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,595
可不是嘛
Ha! Yeah, I'll bet.

514
00:21:10,595 --> 00:21:12,398
我是说间谍的神秘世界
A-about the shadowy world of espionage.

515
00:21:12,398 --> 00:21:14,297
我这么问吧  借研究之名
Let me ask you this-- how many other women

516
00:21:14,297 --> 00:21:17,222
你还"半跟踪"过多少个女人
have you semi-stalked in the name of research?

517
00:21:17,797 --> 00:21:18,833
这是个陷阱问题吗
Is this a trick question?

518
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,646
算了  我根本就不想知道
You know what? I don't even want to know.

519
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:22,123
贝克特探长
Detective Beckett,

520
00:21:22,123 --> 00:21:24,626
卡塞尔先生  你们能回来真好
Mr. Castle, good of you to drop by.

521
00:21:24,626 --> 00:21:27,743
跟我说说你们的特别任务
So tell me about this special assignment of yours.

522
00:21:27,992 --> 00:21:29,565
很抱歉不行  长官
I'm afraid I can't, sir.

523
00:21:29,584 --> 00:21:30,476
你说什么
Excuse me?

524
00:21:30,476 --> 00:21:33,756
没错  此事属于"非需勿知"
Yes, it's on a need-to-know basis.

525
00:21:35,281 --> 00:21:37,074
我需要知道
And I need to know.

526
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,800
长官  我想警部在这件事上
Sir, I think that the Chief of Detectives

527
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,843
会支持我的做法
would back me up on this one.

528
00:21:44,756 --> 00:21:46,281
我们走着瞧
We'll see about that.

529
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,635
你看见她有多抓狂了吗
Did you see how mad she was?

530
00:21:50,635 --> 00:21:52,217
老天  真是太棒了
God, that was so good.

531
00:21:52,476 --> 00:21:53,349
好了...
So...

532
00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:54,327
说真的  出什么事了
Seriously, what's going on?

533
00:21:54,327 --> 00:21:56,485
伙计们  抱歉  我们真的不能透露
Guys, I'm sorry. We really can't talk about it.

534
00:21:56,485 --> 00:21:58,307
得了吧  我们谁跟谁啊
Come on. This is us.

535
00:22:01,108 --> 00:22:02,604
不行  抱歉了
No. Hey, sorry, boys.

536
00:22:02,604 --> 00:22:04,483
这是机密  最高机密
Classified. Top secret.

537
00:22:04,483 --> 00:22:05,644
只能我们知道
Our eyes only.

538
00:22:05,644 --> 00:22:06,977
一级戒备
Defcon 1.

539
00:22:06,977 --> 00:22:08,492
要是告诉你了
And if I did tell you,

540
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:10,660
我就得杀了你
well, then I'd have to kill you.

541
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,961
-那就试试看  -事实上  我做不...
- Yeah? Good luck with that. - Yeah, realistically, that's not--

542
00:22:12,961 --> 00:22:15,129
-我声明遮遮掩掩太烂了  -没错
- I'm gonna go on record and say that this sucks. - It sucks.

543
00:22:15,129 --> 00:22:17,383
晓得了  还是继续调查特雷西·麦格拉
And noted. Now let's move on to Tracy McGrath.

544
00:22:17,383 --> 00:22:18,725
她在下班之后去了哪里
Where'd she go after she left work?

545
00:22:18,725 --> 00:22:20,634
根据她的易行通
Well, according to her E-Z Pass,

546
00:22:20,634 --> 00:22:21,909
她驱车上了新泽西高速公路
she drove down the Jersey turnpike

547
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:23,981
在纽瓦克机场附近下了公路
and exited somewhere near Newark Airport.

548
00:22:23,981 --> 00:22:25,275
我们还在查她去了哪里
We're still trying to figure out where she went.

549
00:22:25,275 --> 00:22:27,424
可能答案仍在犯罪现场
Maybe the answer's still at the crime scene.

550
00:22:28,987 --> 00:22:31,356
没有强行闯入和争斗痕迹
There's no signs of forced entry or struggle.

551
00:22:31,356 --> 00:22:34,003
看来她认识凶手  让他进入了公寓
It's like she knew her killer, she let him in.

552
00:22:34,003 --> 00:22:35,374
她走在凶手前面
She walked in front of him,

553
00:22:35,374 --> 00:22:36,937
他朝她后脑勺开了一枪
and he shot her in the back of the head.

554
00:22:36,937 --> 00:22:38,942
也就是说她认识盖奇
Which means she knew Gage.

555
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:40,927
气候学家怎么会和
So how is a climate scientist

556
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:43,804
一个残忍的前中情局探员扯上关系
mixed up with a ruthless ex-CIA agent?

557
00:22:43,804 --> 00:22:45,924
她又怎么会和潘朵拉有联系
And how is she connected to Pandora?

558
00:22:53,855 --> 00:22:56,483
这里一定有能将两者联系起来的线索
There's gotta be something here that ties them together.

559
00:22:56,703 --> 00:22:58,919
她对车的品味还不错嘛
Well, she has excellent taste in cars.

560
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,146
这里有本1967年产
Here's an auto repair manual

561
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:03,110
庞蒂克GTO的维修手册
for a 1967 Pontiac GTO.

562
00:23:04,011 --> 00:23:05,306
有意思
That's funny.

563
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:08,298
钥匙放在昨天收到的一堆信上
The keys are sitting on a pile of yesterday's mail.

564
00:23:08,298 --> 00:23:09,909
死之前  她还开过这车
She drove it before she died.

565
00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:11,827
但街上没有GTO
Except there's no GTO in the street.

566
00:23:11,827 --> 00:23:13,582
车库里也没有  车呢
Or in the garage, so where's the car?

567
00:23:13,582 --> 00:23:16,555
我在信用卡上发现了一条常规收费记录
I see a recurring charge on her credit card.

568
00:23:16,555 --> 00:23:19,116
看来她每月都会付给
It looks like she's paying 100 bucks a month

569
00:23:19,116 --> 00:23:20,478
弗兰奇停车场一百美元
for Frenchie's Parking.

570
00:23:20,478 --> 00:23:22,549
才一百  在曼哈顿可不止这个数
100 bucks? That's not gonna get you a space in Manhattan.

571
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:24,458
没错  账单信息显示弗兰奇停车场在
Bingo. Billing info says that Frenchie's is in

572
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:25,666
新泽西州的伊丽莎白港口
Elizabeth Port, New Jersey.

573
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:27,229
就在纽瓦克机场附近
That's right near Newark Airport.

574
00:23:27,229 --> 00:23:30,327
特雷西的神秘之旅开的是这辆GTO
So the mystery ride Tracy took has to do with the GTO.

575
00:23:31,516 --> 00:23:32,332
就是它了
There it is.

576
00:23:32,332 --> 00:23:35,506
这可是经典的汽车城[底特律]车
Now that is some classic Motor City iron.

577
00:23:35,506 --> 00:23:38,537
十米长车身  罗契斯特的四排管
400 cubic inches with a Rochester 4-barrel

578
00:23:38,537 --> 00:23:40,435
有360马力
and 360 horsepower.

579
00:23:40,435 --> 00:23:42,785
-你了解大马力车  -是的
- You know muscle cars? - Oh, yeah.

580
00:23:44,051 --> 00:23:46,142
改天我们该去赛道上比比  卡塞尔
We should go to the track sometime, Castle.

581
00:23:46,142 --> 00:23:47,647
看看谁会被套圈[lap有舔的意思]
See who laps who.

582
00:23:49,067 --> 00:23:53,296
你觉得特雷西为什么会翘班来到这里
So why do you think Tracy took off work to come down here?

583
00:23:53,469 --> 00:23:55,598
也许是要驱车到某个秘密的
Maybe to drive it to a clandestine

584
00:23:55,598 --> 00:23:58,043
潘朵拉相关的会合地点
Pandora-related, uh, rendezvous?

585
00:23:58,043 --> 00:23:59,846
不是  看看车上的积灰
No. Look at the dust on this.

586
00:23:59,846 --> 00:24:01,832
这车停在这里有一阵了
This hasn't gone anywhere in a while.

587
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:05,092
你看  卡塞尔
Castle, look.

588
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:08,037
也许她在汽车后备箱里藏了东西
Maybe she came to stash something in the trunk.

589
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,262
有手印  说明有人动过后备箱
Handprints, indicating someone's been in there.

590
00:24:10,262 --> 00:24:11,825
没错
Yeah.

591
00:24:13,637 --> 00:24:15,690
这可不是原车设备
That is not original equipment.

592
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:18,318
是的  八成这就是她来此地的原因
No, but it's probably why she came here.

593
00:24:19,315 --> 00:24:20,840
等等  等一下
Wait-- wait a minute. Wait a minute.

594
00:24:20,984 --> 00:24:22,422
还不知道这里面有什么
We don't know what's in there.

595
00:24:22,422 --> 00:24:23,899
对  这是唯一能知道的方法
Yeah, well, there's only one way to find out.

596
00:24:23,899 --> 00:24:25,980
但里面可能是潘朵拉
Yeah, but it might be Pandora,

597
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,183
就像潘朵拉魔盒  打开它之后
as in "Pandora's box," as in opening that

598
00:24:29,183 --> 00:24:31,102
就会释放出无法阻止的罪恶
could unleash an unstoppable tide of evil.

599
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:32,377
卡塞尔  那个是神话故事
Castle, that's a myth.

600
00:24:32,377 --> 00:24:34,113
我那是比喻
I'm speaking metaphorically.

601
00:24:34,113 --> 00:24:36,961
盖奇在酝酿一起灾难性事件  对吧
Gage is planning a catastrophic event, right?

602
00:24:36,961 --> 00:24:38,544
如果箱子里有末日装置
So what if there's a doomsday device

603
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:40,692
而你开箱的时候就会启动怎么办
in that case set to go off when you open it?

604
00:24:40,692 --> 00:24:43,348
而零点位置就定在这个新泽西州的室内停车场吗
And Ground Zero is a parking garage in New Jersey?

605
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:44,471
我有点怀疑
I doubt it.

606
00:24:44,471 --> 00:24:45,736
我只...
I ju--

607
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:53,112
这是军用手机和扰频器
That is a military-grade cell phone and a scrambler.

608
00:24:53,112 --> 00:24:54,339
是间谍的装备
That's spy equipment.

609
00:24:54,339 --> 00:24:56,037
特雷西来到这里只为打电话
Tracy came here to make a phone call,

610
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:58,290
我打赌她拨的最后一通电话号码
and I bet you that the last number she dialed

611
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,873
仍在手机上
is still on the phone.

612
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,858
关上箱子  转身
Close the case and turn around.

613
00:25:01,858 --> 00:25:03,325
举起手来
Hands in the air.

614
00:25:07,161 --> 00:25:08,514
盖奇
Gage.

615
00:25:09,262 --> 00:25:11,304
把枪和手机放在地上
Your weapon and phones on the ground.

616
00:25:13,155 --> 00:25:15,726
不是吧  该你举起手吧
Really? You put your hands in the air.

617
00:25:18,401 --> 00:25:19,715
把手机放在地上
Your phones on the ground.

618
00:25:19,715 --> 00:25:20,866
我可刚升级
I just upgraded.

619
00:25:20,866 --> 00:25:22,592
这是新电话
This is a brand-new phone.

620
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:29,699
好了...
Now...

621
00:25:29,699 --> 00:25:32,087
恐怕你们不会喜欢接下来的事
I'm afraid you're not gonna like what comes next.

622
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,797
卡塞尔
Castle.

623
00:25:44,451 --> 00:25:46,033
卡塞尔  你在干什么
Castle, what are you doing?

624
00:25:46,225 --> 00:25:49,188
做肉盾  为你挡子弹啊
Bracing myself to shield you from a hail of bullets.

625
00:25:49,572 --> 00:25:50,742
你可真英勇啊
Yeah, well, that's very gallant of you,

626
00:25:50,742 --> 00:25:51,739
不过不用撑了
but you can stop bracing.

627
00:25:51,739 --> 00:25:53,782
我想他走了
I think he left.

628
00:25:53,782 --> 00:25:55,633
往事在我眼前一一掠过
Man, my life was passing before my eyes.

629
00:25:55,633 --> 00:25:57,215
有点忘记时间了
I think I lost track of time.

630
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,306
你熟悉后备箱插销吗
What do you know about trunk latches?

631
00:26:01,176 --> 00:26:03,622
坏消息是
Well, the bad news is,

632
00:26:03,622 --> 00:26:06,336
后备箱没有设计成从里面打开
this one was not designed to open from the inside.

633
00:26:06,403 --> 00:26:07,506
那好消息是什么
And the good news?

634
00:26:07,506 --> 00:26:09,539
至少这次  我们没被铐在一起
At least this time, we're not handcuffed together.

635
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:11,256
这里还挺宽敞的
Mm. You know, it's surprisingly roomy in here.

636
00:26:11,256 --> 00:26:12,109
也没那么宽敞
Well, it's not that roomy.

637
00:26:12,109 --> 00:26:14,095
这里的空气迟早会被耗尽
Sooner or later, we're gonna run out of air.

638
00:26:14,095 --> 00:26:15,447
我们得从这里出去
We gotta get out of here.

639
00:26:15,447 --> 00:26:17,087
也许有人会找到我们
Well, maybe somebody will find us.

640
00:26:17,087 --> 00:26:20,060
卡塞尔  我们被关在长期停车场
Castle, we are locked in the trunk of a car

641
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,345
一辆车的后备箱里
in long-term parking.

642
00:26:21,345 --> 00:26:24,289
在有人意识到我们失踪之前还有很长时间
It's gonna be hours before anyone realizes that we're missing.

643
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:26,370
你觉得谁会找到我们
Who do you think is gonna find us?

644
00:26:26,428 --> 00:26:28,710
我只是觉得  在这种情况下
I just feel, in situations like this,

645
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,245
有信念是很重要的
it's important to have faith.

646
00:26:32,316 --> 00:26:33,659
你是不是按了紧急按钮
You pressed the panic button, didn't you?

647
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,510
要说紧急情况
Well, if there was ever a time to panic,

648
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,996
-我想就是现在了  -我
- I think this was it. - I am--

649
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:38,982
-你应该感谢我  -才不呢
- You should be thanking me. - No.

650
00:26:38,982 --> 00:26:41,983
我才不要等着你女友来救我呢
I am not gonna be rescued by your girlfriend.

651
00:26:41,983 --> 00:26:43,010
过去点  卡塞尔
Move, Castle.

652
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,908
-你要干  -我要往里伸点
- What are you-- - I need to get under there.

653
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,536
你在   你在干嘛
What are you-- what are you doing?

654
00:26:47,757 --> 00:26:48,351
我拿到了
I got it.

655
00:26:48,351 --> 00:26:49,397
什么东西
What?

656
00:26:49,397 --> 00:26:51,056
这个  来
This. Here.

657
00:26:52,638 --> 00:26:53,501
插进去了吗
Is it in?

658
00:26:53,501 --> 00:26:54,326
再往左点
To the left.

659
00:26:54,326 --> 00:26:55,899
好了  插吧
Okay. Push.

660
00:26:56,206 --> 00:26:57,414
往后躺一点
Scoot down.

661
00:27:01,289 --> 00:27:02,775
-成功了  -干得好
- Yes. - Nice.

662
00:27:11,733 --> 00:27:12,960
为你们准备的
For you.

663
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:20,709
我想这是你的配枪
I believe this is yours.

664
00:27:20,968 --> 00:27:23,241
琼斯特工在停车场找到的
Agent Jones found it in the parking structure.

665
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,109
找到车真是干得太棒了
Finding the car was great work.

666
00:27:26,109 --> 00:27:27,461
我想它就是我们所需要的突破点
I think it might just be the break we need.

667
00:27:27,461 --> 00:27:29,063
我可不敢独吞所有功劳
Well, I can't take all the credit.

668
00:27:29,063 --> 00:27:31,940
是啊  发现车子的人可是莱恩警探
Yeah, especially since it was Detective Ryan who found it.

669
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,628
不管怎样  电话显然是关键
Well, in any case, the phone is obviously key,

670
00:27:33,628 --> 00:27:35,248
不然盖奇也不会拼命去找
or else Gage wouldn't have gone after it.

671
00:27:35,248 --> 00:27:37,886
特雷西·麦格拉在她死的那天用过这个电话
Well, Tracy McGrath used it on the day she died.

672
00:27:37,895 --> 00:27:39,977
也许她打给某个同潘朵拉有关的人
Maybe she called someone connected to Pandora...

673
00:27:39,977 --> 00:27:41,981
然后盖奇杀掉她  拿走电话
And then Gage eliminated her and took the phone

674
00:27:41,981 --> 00:27:43,736
不留任何活口
to tie off all loose ends.

675
00:27:44,474 --> 00:27:47,304
但这仍然说明不了盖奇在哪儿
Which still doesn't explain where Gage is now

676
00:27:47,304 --> 00:27:49,039
特雷西电话打给谁了
or who Tracy called.

677
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,149
一旦我们追踪到那通电话  就会知道了
Well, we'll find that out once we track the call she made.

678
00:27:51,149 --> 00:27:52,617
但电话被盖奇拿走了
But Gage took the phone.

679
00:27:52,617 --> 00:27:54,525
你既不知道她打出的号码
How can you do that when you don't know what number she called

680
00:27:54,525 --> 00:27:56,156
也不知道她用什么号码   你要怎么追查
or even the number she called it from?

681
00:27:56,156 --> 00:27:58,112
用最酷的玩具咯
By using all the coolest toys.

682
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:02,514
查下取道收费高速  昨天下午三点时
Bring up Newton Foundation to Frenchie's parking,

683
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:06,254
从牛顿基金会到弗兰奇停车场需要多久
commute time by car at 3:00 p.m. yesterday via the turnpike.

684
00:28:10,301 --> 00:28:11,232
41分钟
41 minutes.

685
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:13,648
在华盛顿大桥那里有起小交通事故
There was a fender bender on the G.W. Bridge.

686
00:28:13,648 --> 00:28:16,094
加上她走到车那里所需的时间
Factoring the time it would have taken her to get to her car,

687
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:18,118
假设她3点45分抵达
let's say she got there at 3:45 p.m.

688
00:28:18,118 --> 00:28:20,908
筛选出接下来15分钟打出的电话
Pull up all cell phone traffic for the next 15 minutes.

689
00:28:22,184 --> 00:28:24,016
电话会经过最近的手机信号发射塔
The call would've pinged off the nearest cell tower.

690
00:28:24,016 --> 00:28:26,241
人在纽瓦克机场的南边
This guy at the south end of the Newark Airport,

691
00:28:26,241 --> 00:28:27,670
则筛选得到
which processed...

692
00:28:28,964 --> 00:28:31,995
15分钟内共有5429通电话
5,429 calls in the 15-minute time frame.

693
00:28:31,995 --> 00:28:34,297
只显示打往纽约和新泽西的
Filter it to calls just to New York and New Jersey.

694
00:28:34,536 --> 00:28:37,011
还有4112通
That takes us to 4,112.

695
00:28:37,011 --> 00:28:39,619
现在只要投币式公用电话和没登记的手机
Now just pay phones and unregistered cells.

696
00:28:41,288 --> 00:28:42,909
降到712通
Down to 712.

697
00:28:42,909 --> 00:28:43,849
通话时间一分钟以内的
Calls under a minute.

698
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:45,364
她肯定言简意赅
She would've kept it brief.

699
00:28:47,263 --> 00:28:48,577
还有42通
We're at 42.

700
00:28:48,855 --> 00:28:50,792
三角定位这42个手机信号
Okay, now triangulate those 42 signals,

701
00:28:50,792 --> 00:28:52,058
看哪通电话的信号
and let's see which one originates

702
00:28:52,058 --> 00:28:54,005
离停车场最近
closest to that parking structure.

703
00:29:01,658 --> 00:29:04,478
找到了  昨天下午3点56分
Got it. Yesterday at 3:56 p.m.

704
00:29:04,478 --> 00:29:06,002
此通电话经过发射塔
This call pinged off the tower

705
00:29:06,002 --> 00:29:07,508
打给了布鲁克林的一个投币式公用电话
and was routed to a pay phone in Brooklyn.

706
00:29:07,508 --> 00:29:09,771
普利茅斯街和金色大街的十字路口
Uh, intersection of Plymouth and Gold.

707
00:29:10,702 --> 00:29:12,188
应该就是特雷西·麦格拉打的那个号码
It's gotta be the number Tracy Mcgrath called .

708
00:29:12,188 --> 00:29:13,588
找到能看到那个电话的摄像头
Get me eyes on that pay phone.

709
00:29:13,588 --> 00:29:16,389
调出昨天下午3点56分所有的当地监控录像
Any local surveillance from yesterday at 3:56 p.m.

710
00:29:17,827 --> 00:29:18,470
找到了
Found one.

711
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:19,793
正在剔除
Isolating now.

712
00:29:20,273 --> 00:29:22,383
有段录像  下午3点56分
There's a video. At 3:56 p.m.

713
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,905
拉近点
Zoom in.

714
00:29:25,922 --> 00:29:27,734
他手上拿着扰频器  就是我们要找的人
He's got a scrambler. That's our guy.

715
00:29:30,544 --> 00:29:32,002
他看起来眼熟
He looks familiar.

716
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:34,467
停
Freeze there.

717
00:29:36,538 --> 00:29:37,708
天啊
Oh, my god.

718
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:39,281
这不可能
That's impossible.

719
00:29:39,588 --> 00:29:41,286
他不是已经死了吗
He's supposed to be dead.

720
00:29:42,638 --> 00:29:43,875
他是谁
Who is he?

721
00:29:44,143 --> 00:29:45,678
尼尔森·布莱克利博士
Dr. Nelson Blakely.

722
00:29:45,678 --> 00:29:47,318
数学教授
Mathematics professor.

723
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:48,948
中情局传奇
He was a legend at the agency.

724
00:29:48,948 --> 00:29:49,591
天才
A genius.

725
00:29:49,591 --> 00:29:50,838
我们的顾问
Consulted for us,

726
00:29:50,838 --> 00:29:52,343
但于2002年去世
but died in 2002,

727
00:29:52,343 --> 00:29:55,364
至少直到刚才我们是这么认为的
or at least that's what we thought until just now.

728
00:29:55,403 --> 00:29:57,177
他伪造了自己的死亡
So he faked his own death.

729
00:29:57,388 --> 00:29:58,711
这事越来越有趣了
This just keeps getting better.

730
00:29:58,711 --> 00:29:59,814
不是这样的
No, it doesn't,

731
00:29:59,814 --> 00:30:01,809
以他的能耐  不能说有趣
not with what this man is capable of.

732
00:30:01,809 --> 00:30:04,159
布莱克利帮我们设计以数学为基础的预测模式
Blakely designed math-based predictive models for us,

733
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,585
用于创造地缘政治的变化
models to help create geopolitical change.

734
00:30:06,585 --> 00:30:07,429
此话怎讲
What do you mean by that?

735
00:30:07,429 --> 00:30:09,290
局里带着问题找到他
The agency would bring him a problem--

736
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:12,186
我们怎样做才能阻止A国家得到炸弹
How can we prevent country "A" from getting the bomb

737
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:14,814
或者引致B国家政权更迭
or cause regime change in country "B."

738
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:16,127
布莱克利找到了解决办法
Blakely found solutions

739
00:30:16,127 --> 00:30:18,957
运用他所谓的关键理论
using what he called Linchpin theory.

740
00:30:18,957 --> 00:30:21,498
他的方法是找到能引起
His approach was to find a small event

741
00:30:21,498 --> 00:30:23,061
大冲突的小事件
that could trigger a large event.

742
00:30:23,061 --> 00:30:24,960
例如引起第一次世界大战的
Like the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand

743
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,015
萨拉热窝事件
causing World War I.

744
00:30:26,015 --> 00:30:27,195
完全正确
Exactly.

745
00:30:27,195 --> 00:30:29,669
他曾说过  你只需推倒一块多米诺骨牌
He once said that you only had to knock over one domino,

746
00:30:29,669 --> 00:30:31,347
如果是至关重要的那块
but if it was the right domino,

747
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,844
其它的就会顺势倒下
the rest would fall.

748
00:30:34,762 --> 00:30:36,267
如果布莱克利就是策划潘朵拉的人
If Blakely is the one who planned Pandora,

749
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:37,869
那将远超出最坏的设想
this is beyond a worst-case scenario.

750
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:40,890
布莱克利只是个雇员  跟盖奇一样
Blakely is just a hired gun, like Gage.

751
00:30:41,015 --> 00:30:42,146
他可不是幕后黑手
He's not the one behind this.

752
00:30:42,146 --> 00:30:43,959
特纳探员  我找到了
Agent Turner, I've got it.

753
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:46,193
录像的清晰度足以读出他的唇语
The video's clean enough to track his lip movement.

754
00:30:46,193 --> 00:30:47,478
他说了什么
What's he saying?

755
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,689
周四下午五点来见我
Meet me Thursday at 5:00 p.m.

756
00:30:51,689 --> 00:30:53,770
象 A5
Bishop A-5,

757
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,925
象  C4  卒  E3
bishop C-4, pawn E-3.

758
00:30:56,925 --> 00:30:58,287
国际象棋走法吗
Chess moves?

759
00:30:58,373 --> 00:31:01,039
布莱克利曾是世界级的国际象棋大师
Blakely was a world-class chess player.

760
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,756
是某种密码
It's some sort of code.

761
00:31:02,756 --> 00:31:05,719
与加密数据库内所有加密模式做对比
Run that pattern against anything in the encryption database.

762
00:31:10,313 --> 00:31:12,481
这个发现将我们带进了敏感地带
This takes us into a sensitive area.

763
00:31:13,536 --> 00:31:15,933
不能让外人知道  我懂的
For your eyes only. I get it.

764
00:31:17,065 --> 00:31:18,647
非常感谢你的帮助
Thank you so much for your help.

765
00:31:19,299 --> 00:31:20,517
琼斯特工会带你们出去的
Agent Jones will show you out.

766
00:31:20,517 --> 00:31:22,483
等下  盖奇怎么办
W-wait a minute. What about Gage?

767
00:31:22,483 --> 00:31:24,862
我们得集中人力物力找到布莱克利
We need to invest all of our resources into finding Blakely.

768
00:31:24,862 --> 00:31:25,926
他是此案的薄弱环节
He's the weak link here.

769
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:27,413
但如果你们发现与盖奇有关的线索
Right, but if you find something on Gage,

770
00:31:27,413 --> 00:31:28,477
麻烦通知我们
you'll let us know.

771
00:31:28,535 --> 00:31:30,741
当然  我们站在同一战线
Absolutely. We're in this together.

772
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,375
知道我怎么想的吗
You know what I think?

773
00:31:38,816 --> 00:31:40,533
我觉得我们应该破解国际象棋密码
I think we should crack that chess code.

774
00:31:40,533 --> 00:31:42,345
中情局能破解的  卡塞尔
The CIA can handle it, Castle.

775
00:31:42,345 --> 00:31:43,448
凭他们的履历
With their track record?

776
00:31:43,448 --> 00:31:44,858
我可不这么乐观
I'm not so sure.

777
00:31:46,172 --> 00:31:47,265
我就那么一说
I'm just sayin'.

778
00:31:47,265 --> 00:31:48,665
一旦我们成功破解密码
Look, we decipher that code,

779
00:31:48,665 --> 00:31:52,290
就能避免一场灾难性事件的发生
we can save this country from a nameless cataclysmic event.

780
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:55,244
要是你想追查布莱克利就去吧
Look, if you want to go after Blakely, go ahead.

781
00:31:55,292 --> 00:31:56,932
我是凶案探长
I'm a Homicide Detective.

782
00:31:56,932 --> 00:31:58,256
我必须找到托马斯·盖奇
I have to find Thomas Gage,

783
00:31:58,256 --> 00:32:00,682
而听从索菲亚·特纳指挥是找不到他的
and I can't do that by answering to Sophia Turner.

784
00:32:00,682 --> 00:32:01,660
什么意思
What do you mean?

785
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,888
卡塞尔  他杀了两个人
He killed two people, Castle.

786
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:04,048
你觉得她对此在意吗
Do you think she even cares about that?

787
00:32:04,048 --> 00:32:05,832
不  她还有别的事要做呢
No. She's got a whole different agenda.

788
00:32:05,832 --> 00:32:08,383
比如拯救世界  我们站在同一阵线
Yeah, like saving the world. We're all on the same team here.

789
00:32:08,383 --> 00:32:10,100
不  你站在她那边
No, you're on her team,

790
00:32:10,608 --> 00:32:11,663
从你看她的眼神
cause the way you look at her,

791
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:13,514
你铁定没有站在我这边
you're sure as hell not on mine.

792
00:32:16,257 --> 00:32:17,225
真有必要吗
Seriously?

793
00:32:17,225 --> 00:32:18,933
这可是保密机构
This is a secure facility.

794
00:32:18,933 --> 00:32:20,582
我们不想泄密
We need to keep it that way.

795
00:32:29,477 --> 00:32:30,752
我刚和阿丽克西斯谈完
I just had a talk with Alexis.

796
00:32:30,752 --> 00:32:33,591
我很高兴你没反对这个实习
I am so pleased you are on board with this internship.

797
00:32:33,591 --> 00:32:35,298
我只是被逼无奈
Because I was forced to be on board.

798
00:32:35,298 --> 00:32:36,813
妈  你怎么会让这事发生呢
How could you let that happen, mother?

799
00:32:36,813 --> 00:32:37,888
亲爱的 别傻了
Oh, darling, don't be silly.

800
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,971
你心情不好
And you're just in a foul mood

801
00:32:38,971 --> 00:32:40,237
不过是因为跟贝克特吵架了
because you had a spat with Beckett.

802
00:32:40,237 --> 00:32:41,589
我才没
I am not in a...

803
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:43,651
你怎么看出来的
How did you find out about that?

804
00:32:43,651 --> 00:32:45,694
不  先别说  等我猜猜
No, wait. Let me guess.

805
00:32:45,694 --> 00:32:46,730
贝克特告诉蕾妮
Beckett to Lanie

806
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,360
她再告诉阿丽克西斯  再传到你这儿
to Alexis to you.

807
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,005
看吧  这就是令我害怕的
See? This, this is what I was afraid of.

808
00:32:52,005 --> 00:32:54,057
不过我得说清楚  我们可没吵架
For your information, we did not have a spat.

809
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:57,135
我今天只是选择待在家
I simply chose to work at home today.

810
00:32:57,135 --> 00:33:02,871
忙于一件牵涉到消失的尸体和特别任务的案件
On a case involving vanishing bodies and special assignments.

811
00:33:02,871 --> 00:33:05,048
不是吧  这事她也告诉你了
Really? She told you that, too?

812
00:33:05,048 --> 00:33:06,918
-我现在还有隐私可言吗  -基本没有
- Is nothing sacred?  - Not much.

813
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:09,651
不过不管怎样  我不能跟你讨论这个案子
Yes, well, in any event, I'm not allowed to discuss it.

814
00:33:09,651 --> 00:33:11,425
拜托  你以前也没因此闭嘴啊
Oh, please. When has that stopped you before?

815
00:33:11,425 --> 00:33:14,465
显然我现在该定定规矩了
Well, clearly it's time i start setting some boundaries around here.

816
00:33:14,465 --> 00:33:15,913
好吧
All right.

817
00:33:15,913 --> 00:33:17,314
我只可以告诉你
I can tell you this much.

818
00:33:17,314 --> 00:33:19,222
我现在在研究一个密码
I'm working on a code...

819
00:33:19,222 --> 00:33:21,217
这个密码就由这三个棋子构成
involving these three chess pieces.

820
00:33:21,217 --> 00:33:23,461
要是能破译出来  就能防止一场大灾难
The answer to which could avert a catastrophe.

821
00:33:23,461 --> 00:33:25,667
两个象和一个卒  这能代表什么呢
Two bishops and a pawn. What could it mean?

822
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:27,019
我也不知道
I don't know. Ohh.

823
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:28,611
我一直在研究经典的棋路
I've been looking up classic strategies.

824
00:33:28,611 --> 00:33:30,079
我看了菲舍尔  卡尔波夫
I've looked up famous chess matches

825
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:31,718
这些象棋大师的比赛
with Fischer, Karpov, Kasparov,

826
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:34,567
但都没发现这个阵局
but this pattern never occurs.

827
00:33:34,567 --> 00:33:36,763
也许棋子跟国际象棋一点关系也没有
Maybe the pieces have nothing to do with the chess game.

828
00:33:36,763 --> 00:33:41,491
也许它们代表了一些跟国际象棋完全
Maybe the pieces represent something else...

829
00:33:41,568 --> 00:33:43,006
无关的东西
entirely.

830
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,505
贝克特
Yo, Beckett.

831
00:33:55,244 --> 00:33:57,085
我没查到关于盖奇的线索  但记得你让我
Nothing on Gage, but remember you asked me

832
00:33:57,085 --> 00:33:58,744
去查特雷西·麦格拉和一个叫做
to look for a link between Tracy Mcgrath

833
00:33:58,744 --> 00:34:00,307
尼尔森·布莱克利的家伙之间的联系对吧
and some guy named Nelson Blakely?

834
00:34:00,307 --> 00:34:00,854
没错
Yeah.

835
00:34:00,854 --> 00:34:02,878
我发现了二人在十年前有关联
I found one from ten years ago.

836
00:34:02,878 --> 00:34:04,729
特雷西曾和一帮她研究生朋友
Tracy and a bunch of her grad student friends

837
00:34:04,729 --> 00:34:06,215
跟他们的教授  布莱克利博士
went on a white-water rafting trip

838
00:34:06,215 --> 00:34:08,699
一同去浅滩漂流
with a Dr. Blakely, their professor,

839
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:10,272
不过他很不走运
although it wasn't a good time for him.

840
00:34:10,272 --> 00:34:12,190
他在旅行中溺水丧生了
He drowned during the trip.

841
00:34:13,887 --> 00:34:15,249
这么说他伪造了自己的死亡
So he faked his death

842
00:34:15,249 --> 00:34:16,822
而特雷西也参与了
and Tracy was in on it.

843
00:34:16,822 --> 00:34:18,529
谁装死  布莱克利吗
Who faked his death -- Blakely?

844
00:34:19,114 --> 00:34:20,649
抱歉
Uh...I'm sorry.

845
00:34:20,649 --> 00:34:21,972
不能告诉你
I can't tell you.

846
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:25,463
男人的忍耐是有限的
You know, a man can only take so much.

847
00:34:29,702 --> 00:34:32,196
-你怎么来了  -我有所发现
- Hey. What are you doing here?  - I found something.

848
00:34:32,196 --> 00:34:33,663
是关于布莱克利的
It's about Blakely.

849
00:34:33,663 --> 00:34:35,821
你不是应该去告诉索菲亚吗
Well, shouldn't you tell Sophia about it?

850
00:34:36,003 --> 00:34:37,595
她又不是我搭档
She isn't my partner.

851
00:34:37,892 --> 00:34:39,053
你才是
You are.

852
00:34:42,265 --> 00:34:43,483
我可以坐下吗
May I?

853
00:34:48,202 --> 00:34:49,458
好吧
All right.

854
00:34:49,708 --> 00:34:52,872
象  象  卒
Bishop, bishop, pawn.

855
00:34:52,872 --> 00:34:54,541
我们知道布莱克利是个世界级的国际象棋大师
We know Blakely was a world-class chess player.

856
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:56,622
特雷西·麦格拉也下象棋  她有计时器
Tracy McGrath played, too. She had a game timer.

857
00:34:56,622 --> 00:34:59,499
但是这种摆法根本毫无战术意义
Yet, this placement makes no tactical sense.

858
00:34:59,499 --> 00:35:00,727
我猜你是有所发现了
I'm guessing you got a theory?

859
00:35:00,727 --> 00:35:02,914
我认为这些棋子跟国际象棋本身没有关系
I don't think the pieces have anything to do with the game.

860
00:35:03,105 --> 00:35:05,772
我认为布莱克利是给特雷西留下了一条加密的口信
I think Blakely was leaving Tracy a coded message,

861
00:35:05,772 --> 00:35:07,162
告诉她去哪里找他
telling her where to meet him.

862
00:35:07,162 --> 00:35:09,167
甚至有可能是他们下象棋的地方
Maybe even a place where they play chess.

863
00:35:09,167 --> 00:35:12,255
好吧  大家经常在公园里下象棋
Okay, well, uh, people play chess in parks.

864
00:35:12,255 --> 00:35:14,940
中心公园  华盛顿广场公园
Uh, Central Park, Washington Square Park --

865
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,858
这些都是跟人见面的好地方
those would be great places to meet up with someone

866
00:35:16,858 --> 00:35:17,999
同时又不会引人注意
without drawing attention.

867
00:35:17,999 --> 00:35:19,994
没错  要是每个棋子
Exactly. Now what if each piece

868
00:35:19,994 --> 00:35:22,977
都代表了一个英文单词的首字母呢
stood for the first letter of a word?

869
00:35:22,977 --> 00:35:24,463
象代表B  卒代表P
Bishop for "B," pawn for "P"?

870
00:35:24,463 --> 00:35:25,892
好吧  字母B然后空七格
Okay, "B" and then seven spaces,

871
00:35:25,892 --> 00:35:27,321
有可能是
that could be...

872
00:35:28,156 --> 00:35:29,153
布鲁克林
Brooklyn.

873
00:35:29,153 --> 00:35:30,850
布莱克利的电话就是从布鲁克林打出来的
And Blakely made his phone call from Brooklyn.

874
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,816
那就是布鲁克林  BBP
So Brooklyn -- b-b-p.

875
00:35:32,816 --> 00:35:35,454
布鲁克林桥公园吗
Uh, Brooklyn... Bridge Park?

876
00:35:36,365 --> 00:35:38,705
他们定在五点见  也就是半个小时以后
That meeting is at 5:00. That's in half an hour.

877
00:35:38,705 --> 00:35:41,409
如果布莱克利去了  我们就能查明潘朵拉是什么
If Blakely shows, we can find out what Pandora is

878
00:35:41,409 --> 00:35:43,155
还可以找到盖奇
and we can find Gage.

879
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,639
你觉得怎么样
What do you say?

880
00:35:51,729 --> 00:35:53,906
布莱克利现在该到了
Blakely should've been here by now.

881
00:35:54,951 --> 00:35:56,207
也许他知道特雷西已经死了
Maybe he knows that Tracy's dead

882
00:35:56,207 --> 00:35:58,384
又或者盖奇已经杀了他
or maybe Gage already killed him.

883
00:35:58,384 --> 00:36:00,993
我选择心存希望
I choose the audacity of hope.

884
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:02,815
照我看他会出现的
I say, he'll be here.

885
00:36:03,295 --> 00:36:05,098
那你不是应该打给索菲亚吗
Well, then shouldn't you call Sophia?

886
00:36:05,577 --> 00:36:07,275
要是我推理错误不就糗大了吗
And look like an ass if I'm wrong?

887
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:09,682
我不得不承认  我有点惊讶
You know, I have to admit, I'm actually kind of surprised

888
00:36:09,682 --> 00:36:11,418
你以前居然从来都没有提过她
that you've never mentioned her before.

889
00:36:11,418 --> 00:36:12,924
我不能说
I wasn't allowed to.

890
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:14,966
她是中情局的在职特工
She is an active CIA agent.

891
00:36:14,966 --> 00:36:15,686
这样啊
I see.

892
00:36:15,686 --> 00:36:17,891
要是你愿意的话
Look, if you want,

893
00:36:17,949 --> 00:36:20,538
我可以回答你关于她的任何问题
I will answer any question you have about her --

894
00:36:20,538 --> 00:36:21,373
你问什么都行
Anything at all.

895
00:36:21,373 --> 00:36:23,041
不用了  谢谢
No. Thanks.

896
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:24,614
你确定吗
Are you sure?

897
00:36:24,614 --> 00:36:26,753
确定  她的事跟我无关
Yeah, I mean, it's really none of my business.

898
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:28,901
好吧  那这件事就到此为止了
Okay. Well, we're done with it then.

899
00:36:28,901 --> 00:36:30,100
好的
Fine.

900
00:36:36,545 --> 00:36:37,753
那
So...

901
00:36:38,539 --> 00:36:41,186
你们俩的关系到底有多亲密
how close were the two of you exactly?

902
00:36:43,853 --> 00:36:45,013
他来了
There he is.

903
00:36:45,013 --> 00:36:46,528
拜托  卡塞尔  是你自己说我可以随便问的
Come on, Castle. You said I could ask you anything.

904
00:36:46,528 --> 00:36:48,466
不  我说真的  他来了
No, seriously. There he is.

905
00:36:51,045 --> 00:36:52,551
布莱克利博士
Dr. Blakely.

906
00:36:54,335 --> 00:36:56,857
恐怕你认错人了
I'm afraid you've mistaken me for someone else.

907
00:36:56,857 --> 00:36:58,929
不  我没认错
No, there is no mistake.

908
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,122
你是怎么找到我的
How did you find me?

909
00:37:02,122 --> 00:37:03,532
通过特雷西
Through Tracy.

910
00:37:04,242 --> 00:37:05,421
她已经死了
She's dead.

911
00:37:06,093 --> 00:37:08,078
如果他们能找到她  他们就能找到我
If they got to her, they can get to me.

912
00:37:08,922 --> 00:37:10,850
我们得马上离开这儿
We need to leave here now.

913
00:37:14,801 --> 00:37:16,959
我早就知道会有这么一天
I always knew this day would come.

914
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,088
但是特雷西
But Tracy...

915
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,824
布莱克利博士  到底是怎么回事
Dr. Blakely, what's going on?

916
00:37:20,824 --> 00:37:22,253
潘朵拉是什么
What's Pandora?

917
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:24,947
我需要你开车带我去32号码头
I need you to drive me to Pier 32.

918
00:37:24,947 --> 00:37:26,223
你现在没有讨价还价的资本
You're not in a position to bargain here.

919
00:37:26,223 --> 00:37:28,755
我是自愿上车的  如果你不带我去我想去的地方
I got in this car voluntarily, and I'll get right back out

920
00:37:28,755 --> 00:37:30,414
我就马上下车
if you don't take me where I want to go.

921
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,438
32号码头有什么
Okay, what's at Pier 32?

922
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:34,509
我们一到那儿
Once we're there,

923
00:37:34,826 --> 00:37:36,494
我一定知无不言
I'll tell you what you want to know.

924
00:37:38,681 --> 00:37:40,570
你是你所处领域的佼佼者
You were top of your field,

925
00:37:41,107 --> 00:37:43,227
还是教授兼中情局的顾问
a professor, an advisor for the CIA.

926
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:44,953
为什么要伪造自己的死亡呢
Why fake your own death?

927
00:37:45,739 --> 00:37:48,617
我为了中情局毁掉了不少国家
I brought down nations for the agency.

928
00:37:48,617 --> 00:37:50,563
我扮演了上帝的角色  但是
I played God, but...

929
00:37:50,563 --> 00:37:53,853
我的关键理论没考虑到人力的消耗
my Linchpin theory didn't factor in the human cost.

930
00:37:53,853 --> 00:37:56,989
我知道他们永远都不会让我离开  只好装死
I knew they'd never let me leave, so I died

931
00:37:57,114 --> 00:37:58,782
再重生
and was reborn.

932
00:37:58,849 --> 00:38:00,777
唯一的知情人就是特雷西吗
And the only one who knew was Tracy?

933
00:38:00,892 --> 00:38:02,264
她是我赖以生存的生命线
She was my lifeline.

934
00:38:02,264 --> 00:38:04,335
她把顾问工作的方向转到了我的理论上
She steered consulting work my way.

935
00:38:04,479 --> 00:38:07,663
我曾帮助非洲减低霍乱发生率
I helped reduce cholera in Africa.

936
00:38:07,663 --> 00:38:10,588
我曾预言只要有一次非暴力反抗
I predicted that a lone act of civil disobedience

937
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:13,686
就会引发阿拉伯世界的起义和重组
would trigger an uprising and remake the Arab world.

938
00:38:13,686 --> 00:38:16,438
我干过一些好事
I-I did good things.

939
00:38:19,996 --> 00:38:21,387
是谁杀了特雷西
Who killed her?

940
00:38:22,816 --> 00:38:25,166
和想要启动潘朵拉的是一个人
The same man that's trying to pull off Pandora.

941
00:38:26,278 --> 00:38:28,561
你是说他们想要实施那个计划吗
You mean, they're trying to make it happen?

942
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,745
这比我想象的还要严重
This is even worse than I thought.

943
00:38:39,436 --> 00:38:40,587
好了  交代吧
All right, talk.

944
00:38:40,587 --> 00:38:42,169
我得先进去
I need to go inside first.

945
00:38:42,169 --> 00:38:44,049
你不老实交代潘朵拉的事  就哪也别想去
You're not going anywhere until you tell me about Pandora.

946
00:38:44,049 --> 00:38:45,257
潘朵拉是什么
What is it?

947
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:49,717
是我起草的一份白皮书的名字
It was the name of a white paper that I wrote.

948
00:38:49,717 --> 00:38:50,801
为谁起草的
For whom?

949
00:38:50,801 --> 00:38:52,431
一个智囊机构曾雇我
I was hired by a think tank

950
00:38:52,431 --> 00:38:55,116
来分析美国安全系统的弱点
to identify weaknesses in U.S. security

951
00:38:55,116 --> 00:38:57,965
以便他们对发现的弱点进行巩固和维护
so they could be shored up, protected.

952
00:38:59,125 --> 00:39:01,878
我发现了一个令人担忧的弱点
I found an alarming vulnerability --

953
00:39:01,878 --> 00:39:04,755
一个与经济相关的关键
a linchpin that was tied to the economy

954
00:39:04,755 --> 00:39:07,104
能造成我们前所未见的
that would cause crisis and devastation

955
00:39:07,104 --> 00:39:09,262
危机和破坏
beyond anything we'd ever seen.

956
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,878
多米诺骨牌会永不停歇地倒下去
The dominos would just never stop falling.

957
00:39:13,549 --> 00:39:16,071
我让特雷西去跟进这个智囊团的进展情况
I asked Tracy to follow up with the think tank,

958
00:39:16,071 --> 00:39:17,174
但却发现他们并不存在
but they don't exist.

959
00:39:17,174 --> 00:39:19,534
不管他们是谁  我把会给美国
Whoever they are, I gave them the blueprint

960
00:39:19,534 --> 00:39:22,641
带来毁灭的蓝图交给了他们
that will bring about the end of our country as we know it.

961
00:39:24,616 --> 00:39:26,007
布莱克利博士
Dr. Blakely,

962
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,532
关键是什么
what is the linchpin?

963
00:39:30,438 --> 00:39:32,289
怎么会有一群鸽子呢
A flock of pigeons?

964
00:39:34,245 --> 00:39:35,904
布莱克利  你所谓的关键到底是什么
Blakely, the linchpin, what is it?

965
00:39:35,904 --> 00:39:38,216
鸽子除非逃避捕食者的追击
Pigeons don't fly in flocks

966
00:39:38,216 --> 00:39:39,904
不然它们是不会成群逃窜的
unless they're fleeing a predator.

967
00:39:39,904 --> 00:39:41,256
他们来了
They're here.

968
00:39:44,478 --> 00:39:45,773
等一下  等等
Wait. Wait! Wait! Wait!

969
00:39:45,773 --> 00:39:47,039
布莱克利
Hey! Blakely!

970
00:39:51,633 --> 00:39:53,388
挺住
Come on. Come on!

971
00:39:53,963 --> 00:39:55,181
-贝克特  -抓稳了  卡塞尔
- Beckett!  - Hold on, Castle.

972
00:39:55,181 --> 00:39:57,272
-抓稳了  -刹车  贝克特
- Hold on!  - Brake! Beckett!

973
00:39:57,272 --> 00:39:59,132
抓稳了  卡塞尔
Hold on, Castle!

974
00:40:00,475 --> 00:40:05,424
待  续
