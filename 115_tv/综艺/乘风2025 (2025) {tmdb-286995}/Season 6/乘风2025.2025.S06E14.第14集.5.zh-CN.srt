1
00:00:12,153 --> 00:00:16,287
纽约市  1947年

2
00:00:35,343 --> 00:00:36,580
再续上  朋友  干的不错
Keep 'em comin', pal. You're doing great.

3
00:00:39,371 --> 00:00:41,202
说不定你能助我一臂之力  我在找个女人
Say, maybe you can help me. I'm lookin' for a dame.

4
00:00:41,663 --> 00:00:42,574
谁不在找呢
Aren't we all?

5
00:00:42,718 --> 00:00:44,127
这个人很特别  你认识她吗
This one's special. You know her?

6
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:45,882
何止认识
Know her?

7
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:47,628
我正看着她呢
I'm lookin' at her.

8
00:00:58,043 --> 00:00:59,395
我怎么才遇见你
And where have you been all my life?

9
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,744
要说到一段历史
Talk about a slice of history.

10
00:01:05,974 --> 00:01:07,116
这个佩尼贝克俱乐部
The Pennybaker Club.

11
00:01:07,509 --> 00:01:09,484
可是20世纪40年代  大腕齐聚登台的地方
You know, back in the '40s, all the greats played here.

12
00:01:09,484 --> 00:01:11,930
要是这些墙会说话  故事可有得说了
If these walls could talk, man, the stories they would tell.

13
00:01:11,968 --> 00:01:14,308
对  不过我们唯一想听的故事是...
Yeah, but the only story we need to hear is about...

14
00:01:14,443 --> 00:01:17,003
斯坦·班克斯的  胸骨有一处枪伤
Stan Banks. Single G.S.W. to the sternum.

15
00:01:17,003 --> 00:01:18,471
我推断死亡时间
I'm calling the time of death

16
00:01:18,471 --> 00:01:19,909
在今早6点到8点期间
between 6:00 and 8:00 this morning.

17
00:01:20,168 --> 00:01:22,182
看来他试图用这个防卫
Looks like he tried to defend himself with this.

18
00:01:22,537 --> 00:01:23,774
显然  没起到作用
Obviously, it didn't work.

19
00:01:24,024 --> 00:01:25,126
那么是抢劫财变杀人了吗
So a robbery gone wrong?

20
00:01:25,347 --> 00:01:27,562
但他的钱包  手机
Well, he still had his wallet, cell,

21
00:01:27,562 --> 00:01:29,586
还有帕克斯维尔湾的房间钥匙还在  所以...
and a room key from the parksville arms, so...

22
00:01:29,854 --> 00:01:30,900
口袋被掏了出来
Pockets were pulled out,

23
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,943
表明凶手对尸体搜了身
indicating the killer searched the body.

24
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,151
找什么  我们无从得知
For what, we have no idea.

25
00:01:34,448 --> 00:01:36,453
奇怪了  他有一把单身公寓的钥匙
That's weird. He's got an S.R.O. key,

26
00:01:36,453 --> 00:01:39,742
可他的驾照上显示他住在34号大街[富人区]
but his driver's license has him living on 34th Street.

27
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:40,749
我们去单身公寓走一趟
We'll hit the S.R.O.

28
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:42,207
看看能不能找到点他的线索
See if there's anything we can find out about him.

29
00:01:42,293 --> 00:01:42,907
谢谢
Thanks.

30
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:45,353
你在找酒喝吗  卡塞尔
You lookin' for a drink, Castle?

31
00:01:45,353 --> 00:01:46,647
因为我确定吧台已经关了
'Cause I'm pretty sure the bar is closed.

32
00:01:46,734 --> 00:01:48,642
实际上  我在找线索
Actually, I was looking for a clue.

33
00:01:48,987 --> 00:01:49,870
找到一个
I think I found one.

34
00:01:49,908 --> 00:01:51,759
哪个流浪汉的小窝  还有...
Some homeless guy's squat, and...

35
00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:54,531
今天的《账报》  他今天早上还在这里
today's "Ledger." He was here this morning.

36
00:01:54,665 --> 00:01:56,717
不管是谁  或许他目睹了什么
Well, whoever he is, maybe he saw something.

37
00:01:57,101 --> 00:01:58,933
我让巡逻小队去排查这片区域
I'll get patrol units to canvass the area.

38
00:01:59,364 --> 00:02:00,275
斯坦死了
Stan's dead?

39
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:02,539
这下可好
Well, that's just great.

40
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,850
我该怎么处置他的这堆破玩意儿
What am I supposed to do with all his crap?

41
00:02:04,994 --> 00:02:07,219
我们会先带走些东西
We'll be taking some of it off your hands

42
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:08,216
这是我们的调查职责
as part of our investigation.

43
00:02:08,456 --> 00:02:10,048
你知道最近有谁在威胁斯坦吗
You know of anyone who's been threatening Stan lately?

44
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,851
我是这里的管理员  不是童子军的女训导员
I'm the manager here, not the den mother.

45
00:02:12,014 --> 00:02:14,009
那好吧  你最近一次看到他是什么时候
Okay, then. When was the last time you saw him?

46
00:02:14,527 --> 00:02:16,262
今天早上  斯坦满脸笑容
Uh, this morning. Stan was all smiles.

47
00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:17,615
通知我他要搬走了
Gave notice he was moving out

48
00:02:17,615 --> 00:02:18,957
因为他的船要来了[鸿运当头]
'cause his ship was coming in.

49
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,818
-什么船  -不知道
- What ship? - Oh, I don't know.

50
00:02:20,818 --> 00:02:22,371
看现在这状况  估计是"泰坦尼克"号
The "Titanic" from the looks of things.

51
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:24,031
如果你还记起其它事
Well, if you can remember anything else,

52
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,086
能给我们打电话吗
can you please give me a call?

53
00:02:25,488 --> 00:02:26,773
别太指望我了  帅哥
Don't hold your breath, hotshot.

54
00:02:28,423 --> 00:02:29,209
我觉得她喜欢你
I think she likes you.

55
00:02:29,555 --> 00:02:31,866
我不知道为什么斯坦怎么会在佩尼贝克俱乐部
I have no idea why Stan was at the Pennybaker Club.

56
00:02:32,096 --> 00:02:34,072
可我们已经分居快一年了
But we've been separated for almost a year,

57
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:35,741
所以天知道他去哪里了
so god knows where he's been.

58
00:02:36,143 --> 00:02:37,716
那你最后一次和他联系是什么时候
And when was the last time you spoke with him?

59
00:02:37,716 --> 00:02:39,500
两个月前  说来真是疯狂
Two months ago, which is crazy,

60
00:02:39,922 --> 00:02:42,435
因为以前我们两个小时不说话都不行
'cause there was a time we couldn't go two hours without talking.

61
00:02:43,183 --> 00:02:44,909
可后来斯坦非要去找达布隆
But then Stan had to go and find that doubloon.

62
00:02:45,254 --> 00:02:47,661
达布隆  是西班牙古币吗
A doubloon, as in old Spanish coin?

63
00:02:47,738 --> 00:02:49,886
他在北卡罗来纳的一个海滩上挖到一枚
He dug one up on a beach in North Carolina.

64
00:02:50,347 --> 00:02:51,555
从那以后  他就着了迷
And after that, he got the bug.

65
00:02:52,198 --> 00:02:54,538
而他看了那愚蠢的纪录片后就更变本加厉了
And it only got worse after he saw this stupid documentary

66
00:02:54,538 --> 00:02:56,676
讲的是克莱德·贝拉斯科  一个寻宝猎人
about Clyde Belasco, the treasure hunter.

67
00:02:57,002 --> 00:02:58,556
对  就是那个人
Yeah, that's the fellow

68
00:02:58,556 --> 00:03:00,349
十年前找到了沉没的南联邦船只
who found that sunken confederate ship ten years ago.

69
00:03:00,484 --> 00:03:01,491
斯坦倍受鼓舞
Stan was so inspired,

70
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,282
他辞去会计工作  去寻找失落的古迹
he quit his accounting job to search for lost antiquities.

71
00:03:04,761 --> 00:03:06,008
即便是我们上一次谈话时
I mean, even the last time we spoke,

72
00:03:06,008 --> 00:03:07,974
他还是满嘴都是他离找到蓝蝴蝶
all he could talk about was how he was close

73
00:03:07,974 --> 00:03:10,391
仅有一步之遥
to finding a blue butterfly.

74
00:03:10,928 --> 00:03:12,875
蓝...是种昆虫吗
A blue... like an insect?

75
00:03:13,555 --> 00:03:14,208
谁知道
Who knows?

76
00:03:14,256 --> 00:03:16,413
在你认识的人里  他和谁有过节吗
Was he having problems with anyone that you know of?

77
00:03:16,701 --> 00:03:18,130
他有债务问题  这我知道
He had money problems. I know that.

78
00:03:18,773 --> 00:03:20,758
两天前  我接到一个男人的电话
I got a call two days ago from some guy

79
00:03:21,065 --> 00:03:21,861
说要找斯坦
looking for Stan.

80
00:03:21,957 --> 00:03:23,971
他说斯坦欠他一万块
Said that Stan owed him $10,000

81
00:03:24,306 --> 00:03:25,486
还说他最好还上
and that he'd better pay

82
00:03:26,263 --> 00:03:26,992
不然走着瞧
or else.

83
00:03:28,929 --> 00:03:30,396
斯坦的私人物品里没有关于蝴蝶的
There's nothing in Stan's personal effects

84
00:03:30,396 --> 00:03:32,199
蓝色的  和其它颜色的都没有
about butterflies, blue or otherwise.

85
00:03:32,343 --> 00:03:33,149
只有一堆书
Just a bunch of books

86
00:03:33,149 --> 00:03:35,556
讲的是40年代的黑帮和曼哈顿
about mobsters and Manhattan in the '40s.

87
00:03:35,585 --> 00:03:37,647
没关系  我查到了
That's all right, because I got a hit

88
00:03:37,647 --> 00:03:39,603
给斯坦妻子打恐吓电话的人
on that threatening money call to Stan's wife,

89
00:03:39,613 --> 00:03:41,272
结果发现是一家干洗店打来的
and it turns out it came from a dry cleaners.

90
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,382
或许他们洗的不仅只有衣服
Maybe clothes aren't the only thing they're laundering.

91
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:44,283
我去查
I'll check it out.

92
00:03:44,293 --> 00:03:44,935
谢了
Thanks.

93
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:51,476
斯坦物品里的有本日记  也是40年代的
Uh, this diary in Stan's stuff, it's also from the '40s.

94
00:03:51,485 --> 00:03:52,943
听起来像是私家侦探的
It sounds like it belonged to a private eye.

95
00:03:52,943 --> 00:03:53,615
听听这段
Listen to this.

96
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,676
"通常来说  妻子们在看到
"Usually wives turn on the waterworks

97
00:03:55,676 --> 00:03:57,643
丈夫出轨的照片时会泪如雨下
when shown pictures of their husbands stepping out,

98
00:03:58,017 --> 00:03:58,899
可这个女人不同
but not this dame.

99
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,383
她要以牙还牙  那么哪一点更糟
She wanted payback. So what's worse,

100
00:04:01,718 --> 00:04:02,975
是我与一位客户共赴巫山
that I pitched woo with a client

101
00:04:03,157 --> 00:04:05,238
还是我在事后为所提供的服务给她开了发票"
or that I invoiced her for services rendered after?"

102
00:04:06,868 --> 00:04:07,463
挺可爱
Cute.

103
00:04:07,712 --> 00:04:08,297
可爱
Cute?

104
00:04:08,854 --> 00:04:11,242
这家伙给人的感觉像个无情的私家侦探
I mean, this guy sounds like a hard-boiled P.I.

105
00:04:11,242 --> 00:04:12,671
雷蒙德·钱德勒: 著名侦探小说家

106
00:04:11,242 --> 00:04:12,671
就跟雷蒙德·钱德勒的小说人物似的
right out of a Raymond Chandler novel.

107
00:04:13,524 --> 00:04:14,781
不知道为什么斯坦有这个
I wonder why Stan had this?

108
00:04:15,538 --> 00:04:16,152
贝克特
Hey, yo, Beckett.

109
00:04:16,622 --> 00:04:17,936
还是没查到那个流浪汉
Still got no word on that homeless guy,

110
00:04:17,936 --> 00:04:19,758
不过有个酒店老板看见一辆白色野马
but a bodega owner saw a white Mustang

111
00:04:19,758 --> 00:04:21,321
停在俱乐部门外的卸货区
parked in the loading zone right outside the club

112
00:04:21,321 --> 00:04:22,194
停了三天
for the past three days.

113
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:24,256
好  去问问有没有人看到车牌
Okay. See if anyone saw those license plates.

114
00:04:24,323 --> 00:04:25,397
-这就去  -好
- Right on. - Okay.

115
00:04:26,155 --> 00:04:27,517
贝克特
Um, Beckett?

116
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:29,895
我今晚能把这个带回家吗
Can I take this home for the night?

117
00:04:30,164 --> 00:04:31,784
或许通过这个能查到斯坦在找的东西
I mean, it might be the key to what Stan was looking for.

118
00:04:31,851 --> 00:04:33,424
你只是因为觉得这个有意思才想看
You just want to read it because you think it's cool.

119
00:04:33,798 --> 00:04:34,661
对  也有这原因
Yeah, well, that, too.

120
00:04:35,246 --> 00:04:36,819
好  只要你...
Okay, just so long as you...

121
00:04:38,776 --> 00:04:40,109
明早还回来就行
bring it back in the morning.

122
00:04:52,106 --> 00:04:54,657
"1947年6月18日
"June 18, 1947.

123
00:04:55,904 --> 00:04:57,458
今天像往常一样开始
The day began like every other,

124
00:04:58,292 --> 00:04:59,779
在我的办公椅上醒来
pulling awake in my office chair

125
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:01,572
拿着肯塔基香酒的瓶子
with a cream of Kentucky bottle,

126
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:03,107
感觉喉咙干涩
A dry throat,

127
00:05:03,624 --> 00:05:05,408
脑袋疼得叮当作响
and a head that was ringing like church bells.

128
00:05:06,665 --> 00:05:09,455
于是  我决定再喝点酒
So I figured I'd kill two birds with one stone

129
00:05:09,551 --> 00:05:11,201
以消宿醉  一解饥渴"
with a little hair of the dog that bit me."

130
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:18,960
该死  弗林先生
Damn it, Mr. Flynn.

131
00:05:18,998 --> 00:05:19,890
你每晚在办公室
Why have an apartment

132
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,981
醉死过去  还要公寓干什么
when you drink yourself to sleep in the office every night?

133
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:23,189
那样的话  我就永远不会迟到了
That way, I'm never late for work.

134
00:05:23,362 --> 00:05:24,148
说吧  有什么事
Say, what gives, anyhow?

135
00:05:24,205 --> 00:05:26,622
我们有个潜在客户  所以客气点
We have a potential client, so be nice.

136
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:30,689
如果你不介意  我还想挣下个月的房租钱
I'd like to make next month's rent if you don't mind.

137
00:05:32,261 --> 00:05:33,336
可以吗
All right?

138
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:34,208
我看上去怎么样
How do I look?

139
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,081
像个明星
Like a star.

140
00:05:36,817 --> 00:05:38,697
"又是曼哈顿岛上平凡的一天
"Just another day on the isle of Manhattan"...

141
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,154
直到她走进来
Until she walked in

142
00:05:40,653 --> 00:05:42,082
带来了改变我一生的案子
with a case that changed my life.

143
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:45,611
她穿着T字带斜面的鞋  和很土的衣服
Wearing t-strap shoes and a country suit,

144
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:46,561
我能看出  那个红头发女人
I could tell that that redhead

145
00:05:46,561 --> 00:05:47,846
是刚进城的乡巴佬"
was a hick fresh off the cob."

146
00:05:50,186 --> 00:05:51,970
你好  我叫莎莉·莫奎恩
Hello. My name's Sally Mulqueen.

147
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:54,732
我想说的是斯科菲尔德  抱歉  我刚结婚
I mean, Scofield. Sorry, I'm a newlywed.

148
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:56,046
还在适应这个新名字
Still gettin' used to the name.

149
00:05:56,698 --> 00:05:57,916
我是乔·弗林  斯科菲尔德夫人
Joe Flynn, Mrs. Scofield.

150
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,891
说吧  你来找我有什么事
So tell me, what has you knocking on my shingle?

151
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:04,360
我劝我丈夫到纽约来度蜜月
I-I talked my husband into honeymoonin' up here in the big apple,

152
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:06,825
可不是因为我想上摩天大楼
but not because I wanted to climb skyscrapers

153
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:07,851
看百老汇表演
and see broadway shows.

154
00:06:08,762 --> 00:06:10,335
我自己另有目的
I had myself another reason.

155
00:06:11,074 --> 00:06:13,519
我想寻找我的姐姐薇拉
See, I'm lookin' for my big sister Vera.

156
00:06:13,884 --> 00:06:14,737
薇拉·莫奎恩
Vera Mulqueen.

157
00:06:15,226 --> 00:06:16,847
我们家庭不和
There was bad blood back home,

158
00:06:16,847 --> 00:06:18,343
两年前薇拉离家出走
and Vera ran off two years ago

159
00:06:18,353 --> 00:06:20,760
梦想在这样的大都市里做一个歌舞女郎
with dreams of being a showgirl up here in the big city.

160
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,227
她给你寄过电报  明信片
She send you a wire, postcard,

161
00:06:22,227 --> 00:06:23,369
或者任何有回信地址的东西吗
anything with a return address?

162
00:06:25,325 --> 00:06:26,370
你能找到她吗  侦探先生
Can you find her, mister?

163
00:06:27,934 --> 00:06:29,209
母亲病了  而且
Mama's sick, and, um...

164
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:30,801
大概活不长久了
Doesn't have long.

165
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:32,796
他当然能够找到
Well, of course he can...

166
00:06:33,544 --> 00:06:35,280
只需每日十五元外加承担所有花费
For 15 bucks a day plus expenses.

167
00:06:38,435 --> 00:06:39,308
还有一个条件
Only...

168
00:06:39,797 --> 00:06:40,833
此事能否不要声张
can we keep this quiet?

169
00:06:41,897 --> 00:06:43,643
如我之前所说  我们家庭不和
Like I said, there's bad blood back home,

170
00:06:43,652 --> 00:06:45,369
如果薇拉从陌生人口中得知
and if Vera hears from a stranger

171
00:06:45,388 --> 00:06:46,606
家人在寻找她
that the family's looking for her,

172
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:48,476
或许她会逃得更远
it might push her farther away.

173
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,548
斯科菲尔德夫人
Mrs. Scofield,

174
00:06:51,162 --> 00:06:52,763
我是最谨慎小心的人了
if I'm anything, I'm discreet.

175
00:06:57,386 --> 00:06:58,326
"那是我第一次见到她
"And that's when I saw her.

176
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,558
看着那张照片  我的脑海中只有一个念头
Looking at that photograph, all I could think was,

177
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,332
多么美的女人
what a beautiful doll.

178
00:07:06,947 --> 00:07:09,134
莎莉说薇拉想要成为一个歌舞女郎
Sally said Vera had dreams of being a showgirl.

179
00:07:09,278 --> 00:07:09,997
或许她实现了自己的愿望
Maybe she made it.

180
00:07:10,553 --> 00:07:12,136
那也不会是这城市里最奇怪的事情
Stranger things have happened in this town.

181
00:07:17,142 --> 00:07:19,012
我的最后一站去了佩尼贝克俱乐部
My last stop was the Pennybaker club."

182
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:22,858
我本希望看到我最喜欢的表演者沙奇摩的演出
I was hoping my favorite performer Satchmo was blowing."

183
00:07:22,925 --> 00:07:24,498
但是似乎没有这么好运
But no such luck.

184
00:07:26,205 --> 00:07:27,135
但是我并不抱怨
Couldn't complain, though,

185
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:30,079
因为站在台上的是贝西·辛克莱
because Betsy Sin clair was up there,

186
00:07:30,991 --> 00:07:33,024
她的歌喉宛如天籁"
and that songbird's got golden pipes."

187
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:37,627
威士忌
Whiskey.

188
00:07:38,011 --> 00:07:39,181
"走遍了全城
"I'll be damned if all that walking

189
00:07:39,181 --> 00:07:40,955
我屁股里的弹片都要闹了
didn't get the shrapnel in my hip buzzing.

190
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:43,046
幸好我知道哪里能找到我的解药"
But I knew where to get my medicine."

191
00:07:51,236 --> 00:07:52,981
说不定你能助我一臂之力  我在找个女人
Say, maybe you can help me. I'm lookin' for a dame.

192
00:07:53,355 --> 00:07:54,008
谁不在找呢
Aren't we all?

193
00:07:54,477 --> 00:07:55,897
这个人很特别  你认识她吗
This one's special. You know her?

194
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:57,604
何止认识
Know her?

195
00:07:58,563 --> 00:07:59,388
我正看着她呢
I'm lookin' at her.

196
00:08:11,011 --> 00:08:12,421
我怎么才遇见你
And where have you been all my life?

197
00:08:13,754 --> 00:08:14,646
"我怎么想的啊
"What was I thinking?

198
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,226
这个女人简直就是一个会走路的麻烦
This dame was trouble on two legs.

199
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:20,256
我一直告诉自己不要盯着她看
I kept telling myself to look away.

200
00:08:21,091 --> 00:08:22,683
她跟汤姆·丹普西在一起  这个家伙简直是
She was with Tom Dempsey, for crying out loud--

201
00:08:22,683 --> 00:08:25,541
纽约市有史以来最残忍冷酷的黑帮头目
the most ruthless mob boss new york has ever given birth to.

202
00:08:30,815 --> 00:08:32,475
丹普西派了两个手下来
Dempsey sent over two of his gorillas--

203
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:33,635
一个爱尔兰人
an irishman,

204
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:36,474
和一个像从哪个哈瓦那黑帮借来的古巴人"
and a cuban on loan from some Havana mob family."

205
00:08:37,673 --> 00:08:38,958
老大想要见你  小子
The boss wants to see you, boy-o.

206
00:08:39,735 --> 00:08:40,521
不好意思  伙计们
Sorry, boys.

207
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,401
我的舞伴预约已经满了
My dance card's full.

208
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,338
我们不是在跟你商量  朋友
This isn't a request, compadre.

209
00:08:51,771 --> 00:08:52,451
你知道我是谁吗
You know who I am?

210
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:54,763
服务生吗  我想要一杯威士忌
The waiter? I'll take a whiskey.

211
00:08:54,849 --> 00:08:56,403
这两个小伙子可以共享一杯黑刺杜李松子酒
The boys here can share a sloe gin fizz.

212
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,582
你给我小心点  小子
Better watch yourself, there, boy-o.

213
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:58,839
小心说话  否则割了你的舌头
Hold your tongue, or I'll cut it out.

214
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,663
耍聪明啊
Mm, a wise guy.

215
00:09:01,927 --> 00:09:02,752
我讨厌耍聪明的人
I hate wise guys

216
00:09:02,752 --> 00:09:04,996
就像我讨厌那些盯着我的女人看的废物
about as much as I hate crumbs eyeballing my girl.

217
00:09:05,571 --> 00:09:07,019
这很粗鲁  没有礼貌
It's rude, uncivil.

218
00:09:08,122 --> 00:09:09,072
不过没有关系  朋友
That's all right, friend.

219
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:10,568
我的手下会好好调教你的
The boys are gonna teach you some lessons.

220
00:09:11,095 --> 00:09:12,371
好了  臭小子  第一课
Okay, boy-o, first lesson.

221
00:09:26,075 --> 00:09:26,804
来  抓住他
Over here. Get him.

222
00:09:40,682 --> 00:09:41,372
"就这样
"There I was,

223
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:44,038
挂着一身的残羹冷炙
covered in the discards of the blue plate special,

224
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,947
我问自己  这么做值还是不值
asking myself, 'was it worth it?

225
00:09:48,996 --> 00:09:49,601
绝对值
It was.

226
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:51,806
为了她不论怎么挨打都是值得的"
She was worth every punch."

227
00:09:52,296 --> 00:09:52,928
你受伤了吗
Are you hurt?

228
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,031
这点伤吗
What, this?

229
00:09:55,086 --> 00:09:55,700
根本不算什么
It's nothin'.

230
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:58,558
你该看看我的脸把那家伙的拳头伤得多厉害
You should see what my face did to the other guy's fist.

231
00:10:01,282 --> 00:10:02,682
那你叫什么名字  硬汉
So what's your name, tough guy?

232
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:04,379
这要紧吗  美人
Does it matter, doll?

233
00:10:04,878 --> 00:10:05,492
薇拉
Vera!

234
00:10:06,384 --> 00:10:07,774
你知道你戴着老大的东西
You know you're not supposed to leave our sight

235
00:10:07,784 --> 00:10:09,021
不能离开我们的视线
with the boss' hardware on.

236
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:16,444
那个蓝蝴蝶
The blue butterfly.

237
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,286
是一条项链
It's a necklace.

238
00:10:19,465 --> 00:10:20,789
这就是斯坦·班克斯被杀的原因
That's why Stan Banks was killed.

239
00:10:22,793 --> 00:10:23,752
我干嘛要独白啊
Why am I narrating?

240
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,900
灵书妙探
第四季 第十四集

241
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,552
干洗店的勒索电话有什么线索了吗
So anything on that threatening call to the dry cleaners?

242
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:36,394
店主说他根本不知道斯坦
Yeah, the owner claims he doesn't know anything about Stan

243
00:10:36,394 --> 00:10:38,005
或者什么蓝蝴蝶
or blue butterflies.

244
00:10:38,063 --> 00:10:40,834
但是一个叫雷·霍顿的人租用了后面的房间
However, a guy named Ray Horton rents out a back room.

245
00:10:40,844 --> 00:10:43,117
而且雷是正在假释中的收注人
Turns out Ray is a bookie on parole.

246
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,553
可能斯坦跟雷约在佩尼贝克见面
Okay, so maybe Stan was trying to meet Ray at the Pennybaker

247
00:10:45,553 --> 00:10:46,838
为了偿还他的赌债
so that he could pay off some debts?

248
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:49,322
斯坦去那里不是为了还债
Uh, Stan was not there because of his debt.

249
00:10:49,485 --> 00:10:51,604
他去那里也不是为了哪只蓝蝴蝶
He was not even there about a blue butterfly.

250
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:55,085
而是为了那条蓝蝴蝶
He was there about the blue butterfly.

251
00:10:55,392 --> 00:10:56,323
是一条项链
It's a necklace.

252
00:10:56,466 --> 00:10:58,807
一个蝴蝶图案的装饰品  完全由
A butterfly-shaped centerpiece made entirely of...

253
00:10:59,209 --> 00:10:59,948
蓝钻镶嵌
blue diamonds

254
00:10:59,948 --> 00:11:02,556
价值轻松达到一百万
worth about a million dollars, easy.

255
00:11:02,748 --> 00:11:03,899
你是从哪发现这些的
Where are you getting all of this?

256
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:04,887
从那个私家侦探的日记
Fron whe P.I.'s diary.

257
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:06,364
所以斯坦是在寻找宝物了
So Stan was on a treasure hunt.

258
00:11:06,364 --> 00:11:07,534
正是  我还做了一个小调查
Exactly. I did a little research.

259
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:11,408
这个蓝蝴蝶宝石在四十年代时失踪了
It turns out the blue butterfly disappeared sometime in the '40s,

260
00:11:11,408 --> 00:11:14,899
有传言说  它藏在佩尼贝克俱乐部的某处
And rumor has it, it's hidden somewhere in the Pennybaker club.

261
00:11:15,503 --> 00:11:16,539
如果他找到了它
If he found it...

262
00:11:16,971 --> 00:11:19,196
价值百万的项链  杀人动机不是很明显了么
A million-dollar necklace? Talk about motive for murder.

263
00:11:19,196 --> 00:11:20,452
对了  莱恩  说小子
By the way, Ryan, say boy-o.

264
00:11:21,133 --> 00:11:21,996
-小子  -小子
- Boy-o. - Boy-o.

265
00:11:21,996 --> 00:11:22,955
-小子  -小子
- Boy-o. - Boy-o.

266
00:11:23,013 --> 00:11:24,039
-小子  -小子
- Boy- o. - Boy-o.

267
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:25,123
-小子  -算了
- Boy- o. - Anyway.

268
00:11:25,804 --> 00:11:26,868
在网上搜索了一下
Did some searching on the net.

269
00:11:26,868 --> 00:11:27,933
相关信息并不多
There wasn't a lot there.

270
00:11:28,057 --> 00:11:29,659
但是我发现  项链据说被诅咒了
But I found, it's supposedly cursed,

271
00:11:29,793 --> 00:11:33,092
曾经属于某位纳粹党卫军官员的情妇
and at one time belonged to an S.S. Officer's mistress.

272
00:11:33,409 --> 00:11:35,106
战后  项链流入到美国
After the war, made its way stateside

273
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:38,204
到了黑帮大佬汤姆·丹普西的手里
and into the hands of mob boss Tom Dempsey,

274
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,515
同时也是这家具乐部的主人  因此我们得回去
who owned the club, which is why we need to go back.

275
00:11:40,726 --> 00:11:41,685
-我们要回去  -是的
- We do? - Yeah.

276
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:45,071
你还记得我们在斯坦手里找到的绿色铁棒么
You remember the, uh, green rod we found in Stan's hand?

277
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:47,104
丹普西俱乐部楼下的办公室
Apparently, Dempsey's downstairs office

278
00:11:47,104 --> 00:11:48,936
涂了酢浆草绿色的漆
was painted shamrock green.

279
00:11:49,118 --> 00:11:50,556
斯坦肯定下去过
Stan had to have gone down there.

280
00:11:50,662 --> 00:11:53,232
而且根据日记  蓝蝴蝶正是被保存在
Also, according to the diary, the blue butterfly was kept

281
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:55,515
丹普西办公室的秘密保险箱里
in a secret safe in Dempsey's office.

282
00:11:56,119 --> 00:11:58,018
我们很可能漏掉了什么
It's very possible we missed something.

283
00:11:58,018 --> 00:11:59,207
因为我们根本没有好好地看过那里
We never really looked down there.

284
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,413
莱恩  你继续追查看能否找到那个收注人
Okay, Ryan, you see if you can get ahold of the bookie.

285
00:12:01,413 --> 00:12:03,158
-卡塞尔和我会去犯罪现场  -好的
- Castle and I will go back to the crime scene. - Okay.

286
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:04,750
-小子  -小子
- Boy-o. - Boy-o.

287
00:12:04,836 --> 00:12:05,565
-小子  -小子
- Boy-o. - Boy-o.

288
00:12:05,728 --> 00:12:06,649
小妖精专指爱尔兰民间传说中的小妖精

289
00:12:05,728 --> 00:12:06,649
-发音要像小妖精一样  -卡塞尔
- Like a leprechaun. - Castle.

290
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:07,407
抱歉
Sorry.

291
00:12:08,874 --> 00:12:09,986
私家侦探告诉莎莉
So the P.I. tells Sally

292
00:12:09,986 --> 00:12:11,953
她在佩尼贝克俱乐部找到了她姐姐
that he found her sister here at the Pennybaker club.

293
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:13,324
莎莉有去找她姐姐吗
And did Sally go talk to her sister?

294
00:12:13,391 --> 00:12:15,060
没有  乔认为莎莉
Well, no. Joe could tell that Sally,

295
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,537
这样一个来自乡下的单纯的女孩
being an innocent girl from the country,

296
00:12:16,834 --> 00:12:18,474
她与黑帮打交道会无所适从
she was a little bit nervous about dealing with mobsters,

297
00:12:18,474 --> 00:12:20,354
因此他自愿回去联系薇拉
So he offered to go back and make contact with Vera.

298
00:12:20,354 --> 00:12:21,831
我敢肯定他是出自好心
Out of the goodness of his heart, I'm sure.

299
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,624
你能怪他吗  我是说  她太美了
Can you blame the guy? I mean, she was gorgeous.

300
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:26,127
不管怎样  乔告诉莎莉他会安排她们会面
So anyway, Joe tells Sally he's gonna go arrange a meeting.

301
00:12:26,635 --> 00:12:31,028
莎莉同意了  但再次坚持乔不要告诉薇拉
Sally agreed, but again, insisted that Joe not tell Vera

302
00:12:31,613 --> 00:12:32,821
是她在找她
that she was looking for her

303
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,720
因为家里那些宿怨的缘故
because of all the animosity back home.

304
00:12:35,468 --> 00:12:36,715
我是对的
Ah. I was right.

305
00:12:37,971 --> 00:12:40,474
我打赌这就是他拿到那根铁棒的地方
I bet that's where he got the steel rod,

306
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:43,572
他可能是想用来撬开秘密保险箱
which is probably what he used to pry open the secret safe.

307
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:45,365
我也不想戳破你的美梦  卡塞尔
Hate to burst bubbles, Castle,

308
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:47,495
但是这个已经很多年没放过东西了
but this hasn't held anything in years.

309
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:49,892
看来斯坦失望而归了
Looks like Stan was disappointed.

310
00:12:50,161 --> 00:12:53,517
是的  如果那就是秘密保险箱他或许会失望
Yeah, he probably would've been if that was the secret safe.

311
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:54,946
那不是秘密保险箱吗
That's not the secret safe?

312
00:12:55,263 --> 00:12:56,231
告诉你一个有趣的事实
Here's a fun fact--

313
00:12:56,653 --> 00:12:58,476
人们通常有两个保险箱
people often kept two safes,

314
00:12:58,485 --> 00:13:01,142
一个放些价值不高的东西  且容易被找到
one that was easy to find for minor valuables,

315
00:13:01,142 --> 00:13:03,856
另一个就没那么容易找到了
and a second safe that was much harder to locate

316
00:13:04,038 --> 00:13:06,368
放着更贵重的东西  比如蓝蝴蝶
for the extra specials, like blue butterflies.

317
00:13:06,426 --> 00:13:08,382
卡塞尔  秘密保险箱在哪里
Castle, where's the secret safe?

318
00:13:08,478 --> 00:13:09,274
马上就说到
Coming to that.

319
00:13:09,303 --> 00:13:11,835
乔和薇拉相识已经五天了
So it's five days since Joe and Vera met.

320
00:13:11,893 --> 00:13:13,254
而他们已经深深地爱上了对方
And they were very much in love.

321
00:13:13,254 --> 00:13:14,492
只过了五天  拜托
After only five days? Come on.

322
00:13:14,492 --> 00:13:16,227
在40年代人们不浪费一点时间
Well, people didn't waste time back in the '40s.

323
00:13:16,227 --> 00:13:17,465
事实上  他们情到深处
Matter of fact, they were so much in love...

324
00:13:18,721 --> 00:13:19,565
已然不顾一切了
well, they risked it all.

325
00:13:20,495 --> 00:13:22,279
那这和我们的秘密保险箱有什么关系
So what does that have to do with our secret safe?

326
00:13:22,691 --> 00:13:25,127
一切就发生在后台
And it happened backstage...

327
00:13:26,432 --> 00:13:27,170
就在楼上
right upstairs.

328
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,191
他们两人正在幽会
They were stealing a moment together,

329
00:13:30,191 --> 00:13:32,215
这很危险  因为她是丹普西的女人
which was dangerous, because she was Dempsey's girl.

330
00:13:33,106 --> 00:13:34,468
当他们四目相对之时
As they stared into each other's eyes,

331
00:13:35,073 --> 00:13:36,425
凯特心跳加快
Kate's heart quickened.

332
00:13:36,751 --> 00:13:38,487
你刚是不是说了"凯特"
Did you just say "Kate"?

333
00:13:39,091 --> 00:13:41,095
你是不是把自己想象成私家侦探
Are you picturing the PI as you

334
00:13:41,162 --> 00:13:42,678
把我想象成黑老大的情妇
and me as the gangster's moll?

335
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,557
什么  没有
What? No.

336
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,293
我没有说"凯特"
And I didn't say "Kate."

337
00:13:46,303 --> 00:13:49,103
我说的是"命运"  "命运的心跳加快"
I said "Fate." "Fate's heart quickened."

338
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,645
我只是想诗意一点  老天
I was being poetic. God.

339
00:13:51,884 --> 00:13:53,429
总之就如我所说的
Anyway, as I was saying,

340
00:13:54,215 --> 00:13:56,191
正当他们要接吻的时候
they were just about to kiss when...

341
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:57,946
嘿呦  臭小子
Oye, chico!

342
00:13:58,416 --> 00:13:59,068
是谁
Who's that?

343
00:13:59,116 --> 00:14:01,782
怎么了  小子  没长教训啊
Hey, boy-o. You must be a slow learner.

344
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:04,899
我的宝贝原来这这里
There's my baby.

345
00:14:08,332 --> 00:14:09,483
他和你是一对吗  辛克莱小姐
He's with you, Miss Sinclair?

346
00:14:10,135 --> 00:14:10,797
是的
Yes,

347
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,619
而且你们那天晚上
and I don't appreciate you lugs

348
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:14,566
打得他满地找牙  我很生气
mopping the floor with him the other night.

349
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:17,558
不是没原因的  但你得低调一点
Not for nothin', but you need to keep this on the hush-hush.

350
00:14:18,268 --> 00:14:20,167
丹普西不喜欢黑白配
Dempsey's not too keen about mixed laundry.

351
00:14:20,378 --> 00:14:22,008
那就作为我们之间的小秘密
Well, then we'll just keep this our little secret.

352
00:14:22,018 --> 00:14:22,718
你们说呢
What do you say?

353
00:14:23,015 --> 00:14:23,878
好了  伙计们
All right, fellas.

354
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:27,570
你最好放聪明一点  薇拉
You better wise up, Vera.

355
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:29,536
如果被丹普西发现他会把你大卸八块的
Dempsey will have you butchered if he finds out.

356
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,023
他虽说吻技了得
I mean, he's a hell of a smoocher and all,

357
00:14:31,023 --> 00:14:31,713
但是该死的  姑娘
but, damn it, girl,

358
00:14:31,723 --> 00:14:33,344
这小白脸真值得你如此吗
is this yum-yum really worth it?

359
00:14:33,353 --> 00:14:34,734
他就是我的心头肉
He's the cream in my coffee.

360
00:14:34,734 --> 00:14:36,959
你俩真像故事里的主角
You two are a walking fairy tale.

361
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,609
我的老天爷
Good lord.

362
00:14:39,232 --> 00:14:40,143
走吧
Come on.

363
00:14:44,795 --> 00:14:45,907
要知道贝西说得对
Betsy's right, you know?

364
00:14:45,907 --> 00:14:48,171
丹普西发现我们的事  定会杀了我们
Dempsey will scrag us for sure if he catches us turtle-doving.

365
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:49,897
你必须要带我离开这儿  乔
You gotta get me away from here, Joe,

366
00:14:49,897 --> 00:14:52,170
离开丹普西  离开这一切
away from Dempsey, away from all of it.

367
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,778
然后去哪里呢  我们能逃得了一时
Oh, yeah, and go where? We can blow this town, sure.

368
00:14:54,778 --> 00:14:56,754
等到我们身无分文的时候还能逃多远呢
Only how far are we gonna get when we're both flat broke?

369
00:14:56,754 --> 00:14:58,480
我们不会的  乔
We're not broke, Joe.

370
00:14:58,883 --> 00:15:01,271
我脖子上戴的东西远远超过我们所需要的了
We've got all the money we need and more around my neck.

371
00:15:01,271 --> 00:15:03,007
我们只要带着它走就足够了
All we gotta do is take it away with us.

372
00:15:03,007 --> 00:15:04,378
什么  你疯了吗
What, are you daffy?

373
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,095
你戴着它的时候起码有两个保镖
You got at least two Brunos with you at all times

374
00:15:06,095 --> 00:15:07,207
跟着你形影不离
when you're wearing that thing.

375
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:08,330
说来也好笑
It's funny.

376
00:15:08,771 --> 00:15:10,315
当我还是个卖烟女的时候
Back when I was a cigarette girl,

377
00:15:10,315 --> 00:15:12,262
我看到丹普西和他的女友
I'd watch Dempsey coming in with his girlfriend

378
00:15:12,262 --> 00:15:13,787
脖子上戴着它走进来
wearing this thing around her neck,

379
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,033
我想得到它
and I wanted it.

380
00:15:15,033 --> 00:15:17,182
没过多久  我成为了他的女人我也得到了它
Pretty soon, I was his girl and I had it.

381
00:15:17,843 --> 00:15:20,356
但这不只是一个项链  它是一个钻石做的枷锁
But it's not a necklace, Joe. It's a diamond noose,

382
00:15:20,356 --> 00:15:21,756
而我越来越喘不过气了
and it's getting harder to breathe.

383
00:15:21,756 --> 00:15:24,029
那我们就要把这个枷锁变成救命索
Then we gotta turn that noose into a lifeline.

384
00:15:24,662 --> 00:15:26,014
问题是怎样变
The question is, how?

385
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:30,503
我不戴时  丹普西把它放在一个秘密保险箱里
When I'm not wearing it, Dempsey keeps it in a secret safe,

386
00:15:30,503 --> 00:15:31,903
而我知道在哪里
and I know where it is.

387
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,158
然后呢
And?

388
00:15:37,628 --> 00:15:38,712
然后
And...

389
00:15:39,527 --> 00:15:40,160
就没了
that's it.

390
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,423
这是日记的最后一篇
That was the last entry in the diary.

391
00:15:42,423 --> 00:15:44,754
什么叫没了  那乔怎么样了
What do you mean, that's it? What happened to Joe?

392
00:15:44,754 --> 00:15:46,730
-薇拉怎么样了  -我不知道
- What happened to Vera? - I don't know.

393
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:49,108
你不知道结局为什么还要告诉我这个故事
Well, why would you tell a story when you don't know the ending?

394
00:15:49,108 --> 00:15:51,160
如果你想听有头有尾的故事
If you wanted a beginning and a middle and an end,

395
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,695
我有27本小说供你选择
I have 27 novels you can choose from.

396
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,164
好吧  那这个秘密保险箱在哪里
Okay, so where is this secret safe?

397
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,859
我不知道  但我认为斯坦肯定找到了
I don't know, but I think Stan must have found it.

398
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:01,566
也许这就是他需要那根棒子的原因
Maybe that's why he needed that rod,

399
00:16:01,566 --> 00:16:03,302
为了撬开一面墙什么的
to pry open a wall or something.

400
00:16:03,302 --> 00:16:04,942
卡塞尔  看这个板条
Castle, look at the molding.

401
00:16:09,027 --> 00:16:09,948
怎么回事
What...

402
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,501
没有锁上
It's unlocked.

403
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:17,764
斯坦找到了
Stan found it.

404
00:16:18,042 --> 00:16:19,548
所以他才被杀了
That's why he was killed.

405
00:16:19,548 --> 00:16:20,891
但谁杀了他呢
But by whom?

406
00:16:21,111 --> 00:16:22,617
雷·霍顿
Ray Horton.

407
00:16:22,626 --> 00:16:25,225
伤人  斗殴  而现在你用干洗店
Assault, battery, and now you're using a dry cleaners

408
00:16:25,225 --> 00:16:27,086
做你赌博生意的幌子
to front your bookmaking operation.

409
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,409
等等  慢点
Whoa. Slow your roll.

410
00:16:28,409 --> 00:16:31,756
我这样的假释犯是不能搀和赌博的
A man on parole like myself can't be mixed up in bookmaking.

411
00:16:31,756 --> 00:16:33,310
那凶杀呢  雷
How about murder, Ray?

412
00:16:34,144 --> 00:16:35,775
你能搀和凶杀吗
Is it okay to get mixed up in that?

413
00:16:36,964 --> 00:16:37,971
斯坦
Stan?

414
00:16:37,981 --> 00:16:39,688
是谁杀了他
And who--who killed him?

415
00:16:40,819 --> 00:16:41,855
我吗
Me?

416
00:16:41,865 --> 00:16:44,032
我为什么要杀我的合伙人
Why would I kill my business partner?

417
00:16:44,032 --> 00:16:45,720
你的合伙人  别扯了
Your business partner? Come on.

418
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,804
是真的  老兄
It's true, man.

419
00:16:46,804 --> 00:16:48,751
是我的一个客户介绍的
One of my clients hooked us up.

420
00:16:48,751 --> 00:16:50,525
他知道我想扩大投资
He knew that I was looking to diversify

421
00:16:50,525 --> 00:16:53,536
而斯坦需要资金去找一条失踪的项链
and that Stan needed financing to find this lost necklace.

422
00:16:53,536 --> 00:16:55,665
斯坦告诉我他需要一万块的开销
Stan told me he needed 10 g's for expenses

423
00:16:55,665 --> 00:16:58,130
去买一个旧私家侦探的日记
and to buy this old private detective's diary.

424
00:16:58,715 --> 00:17:00,787
所以我同意出资赞助他  分一半利润
So I agreed to back him for half the profits.

425
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:03,328
如果这是真的  你为什么要威胁斯坦的妻子
Well, if that's true, then why did you threaten Stan's wife?

426
00:17:03,328 --> 00:17:06,387
因为斯坦躲着我  我以为我被耍了
Because Stan was ducking me. I thought I got played.

427
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:07,951
两天以后他找到我
Then he came up to me two days ago,

428
00:17:07,951 --> 00:17:09,178
告诉我了来龙去脉
and he told me what was up.

429
00:17:09,178 --> 00:17:11,048
他说他找到了那个能补全蓝蝴蝶之谜
He said he found the man with the missing piece

430
00:17:11,048 --> 00:17:12,669
缺失的线索的人
of the puzzle to the blue butterfly.

431
00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:14,338
-那个人是谁  -我不知道
- And who's this man? - I don't know.

432
00:17:14,338 --> 00:17:15,997
但是如果斯坦找到了蓝蝴蝶
But if Stan found the blue butterfly,

433
00:17:15,997 --> 00:17:17,694
大概就是这个人杀了他
that's probably who killed him.

434
00:17:19,517 --> 00:17:22,423
我追查了那本日记  斯坦调查得很深入
So I traced the diary. Stan did his research.

435
00:17:22,423 --> 00:17:24,341
他从乔以前的秘书的孙女手中
He purchased it from the granddaughter

436
00:17:24,341 --> 00:17:26,134
买下了这本日记
of Joe's old secretary,

437
00:17:26,134 --> 00:17:27,659
一个叫做露丝·亨特沙克的女人
A woman by the name of Ruth Huntsacker.

438
00:17:27,659 --> 00:17:28,397
那又怎样
So?

439
00:17:28,397 --> 00:17:30,028
我和亨特沙克太太谈过
So I spoke to Mrs. Huntsacker.

440
00:17:30,037 --> 00:17:32,751
她说她可能还有私家侦探的一些旧文件
she said, she might still have some of the PI's old papers

441
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,209
也许那些文件能告诉我们到底发生了什么
and they might be able to tell us what happened.

442
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,283
她会让她儿子找找看
She's gonna have her son look for them

443
00:17:35,283 --> 00:17:36,722
然后再联系我
and then call me back.

444
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,937
听着  卡塞尔  我承认乔和薇拉的故事
Look, Castle, I admit that Joe and Vera's story

445
00:17:38,937 --> 00:17:40,635
很有趣也很浪漫
is fun and romantic,

446
00:17:40,635 --> 00:17:42,773
但是发生在1947年的事情
but whatever happened back in 1947

447
00:17:42,773 --> 00:17:45,065
和斯坦的凶手没有一点关系
has nothing to do with who murdered Stan.

448
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:47,271
这我可不确定
Uh... I'm not so sure about that.

449
00:17:47,271 --> 00:17:48,451
收注人的不在场证明证实了
Our bookie alibied out.

450
00:17:48,451 --> 00:17:51,146
但弹道报告出来了  我们找到了匹配结果
But ballistics came in, and we got a match.

451
00:17:51,318 --> 00:17:53,179
杀死斯坦的点38口径左轮手枪
The 38-caliber revolver that killed Stan

452
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:55,816
曾一枪夺两命  案子至今未破
was used in an unsolved double homicide

453
00:17:56,046 --> 00:17:57,667
而且那是1947年
in 1947.

454
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,796
我就知道两者有联系
I knew there was a connection.

455
00:17:59,796 --> 00:18:00,784
死者都是谁
Who were the victims?

456
00:18:00,784 --> 00:18:02,923
一个叫做薇拉·莫奎恩的女子
Uh, some lady named vera mulqueen

457
00:18:02,923 --> 00:18:05,014
和一个叫做乔·弗林私家侦探
and a private detective named Joe Flynn.

458
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,513
被杀
Murdered.

459
00:18:09,705 --> 00:18:10,952
真是太惨了
That's too bad.

460
00:18:11,067 --> 00:18:13,109
我真的以为那对疯狂的恋人能逃出生天呢
I really thought those two crazy kids were gonna make it.

461
00:18:13,109 --> 00:18:15,210
是啊  确实不是我所期待的结局
Yeah, not exactly the ending I was hoping for.

462
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,878
我都不知道那么早就有弹道报告了
I didn't even know ballistics went back that far.

463
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:18,020
是啊  从二十年代就有了
Oh, yeah. Since the 20s.

464
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,197
案子毕竟有年月了  系统里的资料有限
Being that it's an old case, there's not much in the system.

465
00:18:20,206 --> 00:18:21,942
乔·弗林和薇拉·莫奎恩的遗骸
The remains of Joe Flynn and Vera Mulqueen

466
00:18:21,942 --> 00:18:22,988
被发现时在弗林的车里
were found in Flynn's car.

467
00:18:22,988 --> 00:18:25,165
就停在佩尼贝克俱乐部的后巷
It was parked in the ally of the Pennybaker club.

468
00:18:25,165 --> 00:18:27,294
两名死者都是被38口径左轮手枪打死
Both victims were shot with a .38 revolver

469
00:18:27,294 --> 00:18:28,982
车被人点着了
and the car was set on fire.

470
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,372
唯一的嫌疑人是汤姆·丹普西
Only suspect was Tom Dempsey,

471
00:18:30,372 --> 00:18:32,041
但找不到足够证据拘捕他
but there was never enough evidence to arrest.

472
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,007
我敢说是丹普西发现他们两人
You know what? I bet you Dempsey caught the two of them

473
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:35,983
预谋一起逃跑  就杀了他俩
trying to run away together, and he killed them.

474
00:18:36,021 --> 00:18:37,095
但是斯坦的凶手是怎么
But how does Stan's killer

475
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:39,483
在六十年后拿到丹普西的枪呢
get Dempsey's gun 60 years later?

476
00:18:39,483 --> 00:18:40,864
除非...
Unless...

477
00:18:40,864 --> 00:18:42,322
就是丹普西杀了斯坦
Dempsey killed Stan.

478
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:45,208
他现在该有九十了吧  不过也是有可能的
He'd be, what, like 90 years old, but it's still possible?

479
00:18:45,295 --> 00:18:46,589
不可能是丹普西
Couldn't have been Dempsey.

480
00:18:46,589 --> 00:18:47,501
他死于心脏病
He died of a heart attack

481
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,428
就在乔和薇拉被杀后四个月
four months after Joe and Vera were killed.

482
00:18:50,311 --> 00:18:51,375
不过呢...
Still...

483
00:18:51,749 --> 00:18:53,917
我们还是该去把1947年的那份案宗调出来
we should dig up that 1947 police report.

484
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:55,672
里面或许有关于枪的一些记录
There could be something in there about the gun

485
00:18:55,672 --> 00:18:57,033
能帮我们侦破斯坦的凶案
that could shed some light on Stan's murder.

486
00:18:57,033 --> 00:18:58,232
好吧  我去仓库
All right. I'll go to the warehouse

487
00:18:58,232 --> 00:18:59,287
把以前的案宗调出来
and I'll pull up the old case files.

488
00:18:59,287 --> 00:19:01,541
我也想去
Oh, oh, uh, I want to go.

489
00:19:02,874 --> 00:19:04,207
好吧
Uh, okay.

490
00:19:04,207 --> 00:19:05,770
-我开车行吗  -随你便
- Can I drive? - I don't care.

491
00:19:09,194 --> 00:19:10,153
是这样...
So...

492
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:11,947
我刚刚查了曾属于丹普西的枪支
I did a search of guns Dempsey used to own.

493
00:19:11,947 --> 00:19:13,385
结果发现曾举办过一次资产出售
Turns out there was an estate sale

494
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:15,015
一个名叫克莱德·贝拉斯科的寻宝猎人
where a treasure hunter named Clyde Belasco

495
00:19:15,015 --> 00:19:17,854
买下了丹普西所有的枪  包括两把38口径
bought all of Dempsey's firearms, including 2 .38s.

496
00:19:17,854 --> 00:19:19,427
等等  克莱德·贝拉斯科吗
Wait. Clyde Belasco?

497
00:19:19,437 --> 00:19:20,405
斯坦的妻子说
Stan's wife said that

498
00:19:20,405 --> 00:19:22,582
他们俩看了一部关于他的纪录片
the two of them watched a documentary about him,

499
00:19:22,582 --> 00:19:24,980
而斯坦因此受到鼓舞变成了一个寻宝猎人
and that inspired Stan to become a treasure hunter.

500
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,418
联系还不止于此
Well, the connections don't stop there.

501
00:19:26,418 --> 00:19:28,221
贝拉斯科一周前从法国飞入境
Belasco flew in from France a week ago,

502
00:19:28,221 --> 00:19:29,756
我刚刚找到一篇文章说
and I just found an article that said

503
00:19:29,756 --> 00:19:32,364
他找蓝蝴蝶已经有十五年了
that he searched for the Blue Butterfly for 15 years.

504
00:19:32,364 --> 00:19:34,618
那个收注人说斯坦找到一个
That bookie said that Stan found someone

505
00:19:34,618 --> 00:19:36,824
有缺失的那部分线索的人
who had the missing piece of the puzzle.

506
00:19:36,824 --> 00:19:38,138
或许贝拉斯科就是那个人
Well, maybe Belasco's that someone.

507
00:19:38,138 --> 00:19:39,768
证物  Flynn和莫奎恩凶杀案  1947年6月24日

508
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:40,900
在这儿呢
Here it is.

509
00:19:42,108 --> 00:19:43,978
最近有人擦过上面的灰尘
This has been dusted off recently.

510
00:19:45,053 --> 00:19:47,306
看来我们不是唯一对本案感兴趣的人
Looks like we're not the only ones interested in this case.

511
00:19:48,026 --> 00:19:49,963
斯坦来过这儿  肯定是他
Stan was here. Had to be.

512
00:19:49,963 --> 00:19:52,197
你想啊  日记  凶案
Think about it--the diary, the murders...

513
00:19:52,207 --> 00:19:54,058
我们只是在跟着他的脚印前行
All we're doing is walking in his footsteps.

514
00:19:54,058 --> 00:19:55,813
这就是下一条线索
This is the next piece of the puzzle.

515
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:58,892
薇拉和私家侦探遇害现场的照片
Huh. Crime scene photo of Vera and the P.I.

516
00:20:00,253 --> 00:20:01,040
该死的  乔
Damn it, Joe.

517
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,219
老伙计
You old sap.

518
00:20:02,219 --> 00:20:04,435
爱上一个女孩  害得自己身陷火海
Dizzy with a dame and got yourself cooked.

519
00:20:04,444 --> 00:20:07,034
亨弗瑞·鲍嘉: 老影星  《卡萨布兰卡》的男主角

520
00:20:04,444 --> 00:20:07,034
鲍嘉先生  我们到底要找什么呢
So, Mr. Bogart, what exactly are we looking for here?

521
00:20:07,034 --> 00:20:09,460
1947年的那起凶案和现在的这起
Our 1947 murders and our present-day murder

522
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,011
之间的联系肯定不仅仅是那支枪
have to be connected by more than just a gun.

523
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:14,275
这里面就能找到别的联系
Somewhere in here is that connection.

524
00:20:15,828 --> 00:20:18,101
是啊  我的确买了几支汤姆·丹普西的左轮
Yes, I bought several of Tom Dempsey's revolvers.

525
00:20:18,101 --> 00:20:20,738
你们如果愿意  大可去检查每一把
And by all means, test fire every last one of them as you wish.

526
00:20:20,738 --> 00:20:23,644
我们会的  好了  说说你跟斯坦怎么认识的
We will. Now... how do you know Stan?

527
00:20:23,644 --> 00:20:25,678
你必须了解我是上过电视的人
You have to understand that I'm on television.

528
00:20:25,678 --> 00:20:26,991
也有写我的文章
Articles are written about me.

529
00:20:26,991 --> 00:20:29,283
因此  有些业余人士会登门找我
Because of this, the amateurs come a-knocking.

530
00:20:29,283 --> 00:20:31,624
这是我的职业危害
It's an occupational hazard.

531
00:20:31,873 --> 00:20:34,031
那么斯坦来找你是为了什么呢
And what was the purpose of Stan's visit?

532
00:20:34,031 --> 00:20:36,189
当然是冲着蓝蝴蝶来的
Why, the Blue Butterfly, of course.

533
00:20:36,582 --> 00:20:38,433
他肯定是读到了我费尽心思在找它
He must have read of my exploits searching for it

534
00:20:38,433 --> 00:20:41,665
就跑来用他荒谬的故事烦我
and decided to burden me with his preposterous story.

535
00:20:41,665 --> 00:20:42,892
什么故事
And what story was that?

536
00:20:42,892 --> 00:20:45,578
他说他找到了一本旧私家侦探的日记
That he had found an old private investigator's diary,

537
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,927
里面有缺失的线索
which held missing clues.

538
00:20:48,388 --> 00:20:49,241
你不相信吗
You didn't believe him?

539
00:20:49,241 --> 00:20:50,152
当然不
Of course not.

540
00:20:50,152 --> 00:20:52,473
我要求看这本传说中的日记时  他拒绝了
When I asked to see the alleged diary, he refused.

541
00:20:52,473 --> 00:20:56,165
却要求看我对佩尼贝克俱乐部的所有研究
And yet, he wanted access to all my research on the Pennybaker club.

542
00:20:56,165 --> 00:20:58,899
说真的  整件事都很荒谬
I mean, really, the whole thing was absurd.

543
00:20:58,899 --> 00:21:01,565
他甚至要求从后面走
He even asked to exit out the back door.

544
00:21:01,565 --> 00:21:03,272
说有辆车在跟踪他
Said a car was following him.

545
00:21:03,272 --> 00:21:04,730
是一辆白色的野马
It was a white mustang.

546
00:21:05,104 --> 00:21:08,038
大概还有别人也对蓝蝴蝶有兴趣
I guess someone else was interested in the Blue Butterfly, too.

547
00:21:08,345 --> 00:21:10,302
感觉像是海底捞针
It feels like we're looking for a needle in a haystack,

548
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,105
不过我们连海都没找到呢
except for, we can't find the haystack.

549
00:21:12,268 --> 00:21:14,886
要是找到了针还要海何用
Who needs a haystack when the needle is right here?

550
00:21:15,202 --> 00:21:18,031
这是一份乔的秘书肯纳德太太的口供
This is a statement from Joe's secretary Mrs. Kennard.

551
00:21:18,031 --> 00:21:19,969
就在他死后记录下来的
It was taken right after his death.

552
00:21:20,103 --> 00:21:21,302
"福劳伦斯·肯纳德太太
"Mrs. Florence Kennard,

553
00:21:21,302 --> 00:21:22,721
死者乔·弗林的秘书
secretary to the victim Joe Flynn,

554
00:21:22,721 --> 00:21:24,658
作证称目睹了下面这段发生于
attested to bearing witness to the following conversation

555
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:28,706
1947年6月24日早晨  两位死者间的对话
between both victims on the morning of June 24, 1947."

556
00:21:28,715 --> 00:21:30,365
我办法都想尽了  宝贝
I've worked this from every angle, doll.

557
00:21:30,365 --> 00:21:32,753
我们不可能打开丹普西的秘密保险箱的
There's no way we can crack Dempsey's secret safe.

558
00:21:32,753 --> 00:21:33,856
那我们要怎么拿到
Well, then how are we gonna get it?

559
00:21:33,865 --> 00:21:36,119
简单  你今晚要戴着它走出来
Easy. You're gonna walk right out the door with it tonight.

560
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:38,977
怎么做  今早甩掉丹普西的走狗就很难了
How? It was hard enough shaking Dempsey's hatchet men this morning.

561
00:21:38,977 --> 00:21:41,422
我戴着蓝蝴蝶的时候会更难的
It's gonna be that much harder when I'm wearing the Blue Butterfly.

562
00:21:41,422 --> 00:21:43,964
相信我  会轻而易举的
It'll be a cakewalk. Trust me.

563
00:21:44,117 --> 00:21:46,409
特别是我们还有好朋友吉米·度耶相助
Especially with our friend Jimmy Doyle helping us out.

564
00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:48,606
-吉米·度耶是谁  -他是个职业拳击手
- And who's Jimmy Doyle? - He's a prizefighter,

565
00:21:48,606 --> 00:21:50,342
而今晚他要迎战舒格·雷·罗宾逊
and tonight he's taking on Sugar Ray Robinson

566
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:51,444
争夺次中量级冠军
for the welterweight title.

567
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:52,039
那又如何
So?

568
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:54,907
那么每个值得尊敬的喜欢苜蓿的爱尔兰佬
So every clover-loving Irishman worth his salt

569
00:21:54,907 --> 00:21:56,134
今晚都会凑在收音机前
will be huddled around a radio tonight,

570
00:21:56,134 --> 00:21:57,573
为吉米呐喊助威
cheering good ol' Jimmy on.

571
00:21:57,793 --> 00:21:59,836
你等到比赛正酣的时候
You're gonna wait till a rousing part of the fight.

572
00:21:59,836 --> 00:22:01,409
借故离开
Then you're gonna excuse yourself.

573
00:22:01,409 --> 00:22:02,780
不管是谁被指派盯着你
Whoever's assigned to be watching you

574
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,017
肯定不会留意你的动向
surely won't be paying much attention.

575
00:22:04,017 --> 00:22:06,760
你趁这时从后门溜走
That's when you slip right out the back door,

576
00:22:07,154 --> 00:22:08,678
而我会在那里等你
where I'll be waiting for you.

577
00:22:09,187 --> 00:22:10,251
乔
Oh, Joe.

578
00:22:11,421 --> 00:22:12,553
这真是太好了
It's perfect.

579
00:22:12,639 --> 00:22:14,500
不  这太疯狂了
No, it's crazy.

580
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,418
你在想什么啊  弗林先生
What are you thinkin', Mr. Flynn?

581
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,672
我告诉你  这姑娘是祸水
And I can tell you, this Jane's no good.

582
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:19,832
你在说什么啊
Now what are you on about?

583
00:22:19,832 --> 00:22:23,342
看看我  我脱胎换骨  比以前强多了
Look at me. I'm a new man. I'm a better man.

584
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:25,385
自从我遇见薇拉我滴酒未沾
I haven't even had a drink since I met Vera,

585
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,178
如果这还不算个奇迹  那什么是奇迹
And if that's not a minor miracle, I don't know what is.

586
00:22:27,178 --> 00:22:28,473
你泡在酒精里也比
You would be better off with the booze

587
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:29,854
泡在她怀里强
than with this chippy.

588
00:22:30,055 --> 00:22:32,712
你们的恋情是构建在什么样的基础上呢
A-and what are you basing a relationship on, huh,

589
00:22:32,712 --> 00:22:34,774
豪夺和谎言吗
a robbery and a lie?

590
00:22:34,774 --> 00:22:35,877
什么谎言
What lie?

591
00:22:37,171 --> 00:22:39,166
我想现在该向你坦白了
Well, I guess it's time to come clean, huh?

592
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:40,221
听我说  宝贝
Look, doll,

593
00:22:40,423 --> 00:22:42,072
那晚我们在俱乐部相见并非巧合
it's no coincidence I met you in the club that night.

594
00:22:42,072 --> 00:22:43,578
我是受人雇用去找你的
I was hired to come find you, see?

595
00:22:43,587 --> 00:22:45,045
但我不能告诉你雇主是谁
Only I couldn't tell you who.

596
00:22:45,342 --> 00:22:46,215
这是...
It's just...

597
00:22:46,215 --> 00:22:48,814
别拐弯抹角了  乔  谁雇了你
Cut the corners, Joe. Who hired you?

598
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:50,349
是你妹妹
It was your sister.

599
00:22:51,126 --> 00:22:52,152
乔
Joe...

600
00:22:52,334 --> 00:22:54,022
我没有妹妹
I don't have a sister.

601
00:22:56,995 --> 00:22:59,133
-后来呢  -不知道  口供就到这儿
- What happens next? - I don't know. That's the end of the statement.

602
00:22:59,143 --> 00:23:01,291
可如果莎莉不是薇拉的妹妹  她是谁呢
But if Sally wasn't Vera's sister, then who was she?

603
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:03,334
莎莉给私家侦探下了套
Sally set up the P.I.

604
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,993
是经典的黑色电影大逆转啊
It's a classic film noir twist.

605
00:23:04,993 --> 00:23:06,739
-可为什么呢  -不知道
- But why? - I don't know.

606
00:23:06,739 --> 00:23:08,417
-莎莉的目的是什么  -不知道
- What was Sally up to? - I don't know.

607
00:23:08,417 --> 00:23:09,693
你觉得她跟丹普西有牵连吗
Do you think she was connected to Dempsey?

608
00:23:09,693 --> 00:23:11,524
不知道  但这是不是太棒了
I don't know, but isn't this great?

609
00:23:12,608 --> 00:23:13,673
贝克特
Yo, Beckett.

610
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:16,137
巡警找到了那个在佩尼贝克非法居住的
So our uniforms got a line on that homeless guy

611
00:23:16,137 --> 00:23:17,298
流浪汉的线索
who was squatting in the Pennybaker.

612
00:23:17,298 --> 00:23:18,439
卖热狗的小贩认出了他
A hot dog vendor I.D.'ed him.

613
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,779
说他名叫西区瓦利
Said the guy goes by the name of West Side Wally.

614
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:21,805
我通缉了他
I put a want out on the guy.

615
00:23:21,805 --> 00:23:22,985
很好  那也许是我们抓住
Great. That might be the break we need

616
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:24,164
杀害斯坦真凶的突破口
to catch Stan's killer.

617
00:23:24,164 --> 00:23:24,865
接个电话
Excuse me.

618
00:23:24,865 --> 00:23:26,370
喂
Hello.

619
00:23:27,157 --> 00:23:28,106
什么
What?

620
00:23:28,336 --> 00:23:29,238
什么时候
When?

621
00:23:29,698 --> 00:23:31,079
好吧  我就出发  多谢
All right. I'm on my way. Thank you.

622
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:33,247
是斯坦所住酒店的经理打来的
That was the manager of Stan's residency hotel.

623
00:23:33,247 --> 00:23:34,877
一个开着白色野马的男人
A guy driving a white Mustang

624
00:23:34,877 --> 00:23:36,584
刚刚闯进了斯坦的房间
just forced his way into Stan's room,

625
00:23:36,584 --> 00:23:37,438
他还在那儿
and he's still there.

626
00:23:37,677 --> 00:23:39,288
纽约警局  举起手来
NYPD! Show us your hands.

627
00:23:39,298 --> 00:23:40,727
举起手来  现在
Show us your hands. Now!

628
00:23:41,408 --> 00:23:43,019
慢慢转过身来
Turn around slowly.

629
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:52,926
你是汤姆·丹普西
You're Tom Dempsey.

630
00:23:53,415 --> 00:23:54,537
没错  是我
Yeah, that's me.

631
00:24:02,629 --> 00:24:05,103
汤姆·丹普西三世
Tom Dempsey III.

632
00:24:05,161 --> 00:24:06,369
太像了
Dead ringer.

633
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:08,335
简直是一个模子刻的
Complete doppelganger.

634
00:24:08,335 --> 00:24:10,819
遗传基因的作用  又不是魔术
It's D.N.A., guys. It's not a magic trick.

635
00:24:10,838 --> 00:24:12,258
我是他孙子
I'm his grandson.

636
00:24:12,421 --> 00:24:13,370
好吧
All right, look.

637
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,145
破门而入我很抱歉
I'm sorry I broke in a door.

638
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:17,235
我会赔偿损失  没什么大不了
I'll pay for the damages. It's no big deal.

639
00:24:17,235 --> 00:24:18,204
为什么还不放我走
Why am I still here?

640
00:24:18,204 --> 00:24:19,757
我们只是好奇  想看看
Well, we were just curious to see

641
00:24:19,757 --> 00:24:21,781
除了长相  你是否还从你祖父那里
if you inherited anything else from your grandfather,

642
00:24:21,781 --> 00:24:22,788
继承了别的什么
aside from his looks.

643
00:24:22,788 --> 00:24:25,080
是啊  比如你用来杀害斯坦·班克斯的
Yeah, like one of his .38 revolvers that you used

644
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,567
点38左轮手枪
to kill Stan Banks.

645
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:28,475
等等  不是这样的
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. That didn't happen.

646
00:24:28,475 --> 00:24:30,153
是斯坦来找我
Look, Stan came to me,

647
00:24:30,153 --> 00:24:32,810
可他告诉我  他名叫纳撒尼尔·詹金斯
only he told me his name was Nathaniel Jenkins.

648
00:24:32,954 --> 00:24:34,364
他说他是个传记作家
He said he was a biographer,

649
00:24:34,364 --> 00:24:36,617
说他想写一个关于我祖父的故事
said he wanted to do a story about my grandfather.

650
00:24:36,617 --> 00:24:38,842
他保证说不会写他的违法交易
He promised not to focus on his underworld dealings,

651
00:24:38,842 --> 00:24:40,703
只侧重好的一面
just on the--the good stuff,

652
00:24:40,703 --> 00:24:42,861
比如说我祖父是社区的支柱
like how my granddad was a pillar of the community.

653
00:24:42,861 --> 00:24:44,472
社区祸害还差不多
More like a killer of the community.

654
00:24:44,472 --> 00:24:45,843
当他这么提议
And so when he made his pitch,

655
00:24:45,853 --> 00:24:49,114
你因为想重塑家族名望  就答应配合了
you, wanting to rehabilitate your family name, cooperated.

656
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:49,958
是的
Yeah.

657
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:52,183
我给他看了祖父留下的所有旧文件
I gave him access to all of granddad's old papers,

658
00:24:52,183 --> 00:24:53,832
一切进展顺利
and everything was cool...

659
00:24:54,542 --> 00:24:56,374
直到我发现这整件事都是个谎言
until I found out the whole thing was a lie.

660
00:24:57,419 --> 00:24:58,704
你怎么发现的
And how'd you do that?

661
00:24:59,126 --> 00:25:00,814
过去在我祖父的俱乐部里
There's this singer who used to

662
00:25:00,814 --> 00:25:01,984
有个红极一时的歌手
headline at my granddad's club--

663
00:25:01,984 --> 00:25:03,336
叫贝西·辛克莱
Betsy Sinclair.

664
00:25:03,701 --> 00:25:05,312
几周前  她过世了
Couple weeks ago, she passed away.

665
00:25:05,312 --> 00:25:07,019
我前去悼念
Well, I went there to pay my respects,

666
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:08,400
在那里看见了纳撒尼尔
and who do I see there but Nathaniel,

667
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,781
正跟个老头聊天
chatting up this old guy.

668
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:11,622
他看见了我  立马从后面跑了
He sees me, jets out the back.

669
00:25:11,622 --> 00:25:13,588
我完全不明白这是怎么回事
I'm like, "What the hell is this all about," right?

670
00:25:13,588 --> 00:25:15,123
所以我查看了来宾名单
So I look in the guest book.

671
00:25:15,861 --> 00:25:17,031
才发现
I figured it out.

672
00:25:17,348 --> 00:25:20,187
他所签的真名是  斯坦·班克斯
He'd signed his real name-- Stan Banks.

673
00:25:20,369 --> 00:25:22,728
你就知道他不是传记作家
Which is when you figured out he wasn't really a biographer.

674
00:25:22,728 --> 00:25:24,579
他只是又一个卑鄙的寻宝猎人
He was just another lowlife treasure hunter,

675
00:25:24,579 --> 00:25:26,181
在找蓝蝴蝶的下落
looking for the blue butterfly.

676
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:28,847
再说  如果有谁该得到蓝蝴蝶
And if anybody deserved the blue butterfly,

677
00:25:28,923 --> 00:25:30,209
那人理应是你  对吗
it was you, right?

678
00:25:31,302 --> 00:25:32,740
所以你跟踪了斯坦
So you followed Stan.

679
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,697
斯坦找到了它的下落  你就枪杀了他
And when stan found it, you shot him.

680
00:25:34,697 --> 00:25:36,807
不  我没有  我没有对他开枪
No, I did not-- I did not shoot him.

681
00:25:37,967 --> 00:25:40,317
斯坦  等等  斯坦找到了
Stan--wait. Stan did find it?

682
00:25:40,326 --> 00:25:41,775
得了  别装了
Come on. You tell us.

683
00:25:41,775 --> 00:25:43,673
我真不知道  我不在场
I don't know. I was not there.

684
00:25:43,673 --> 00:25:45,812
我看报  发现他死了
I read in the newspaper that the guy was dead.

685
00:25:45,812 --> 00:25:47,845
我就去他的公寓  看看能有什么发现
I went to his apartment to see what I could find.

686
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:49,648
我没有杀他
And I didn't kill the guy.

687
00:25:49,974 --> 00:25:51,547
丹普西的不在场证明成立
So Dempsey's alibi holds up.

688
00:25:51,547 --> 00:25:53,053
他没有杀斯坦
He didn't kill Stan.

689
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:55,661
没关系  我们有突破口了
Well, that's all right, because we caught a break.

690
00:25:55,661 --> 00:25:57,292
警员终于追踪到了西区瓦利的下落
Unis finally tracked down West Side Wally.

691
00:25:57,301 --> 00:25:58,011
正带他过来问话
They're bringing him in now.

692
00:25:58,011 --> 00:25:59,344
很好  也许这能对弄清斯坦的遭遇
Great. Maybe that can shed some light

693
00:25:59,344 --> 00:26:00,620
有所帮助
as to what happened to Stan.

694
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,509
如果他不能  也许杰瑞·马多克斯可以
And if he can't, maybe Jerry Maddox can.

695
00:26:02,509 --> 00:26:03,833
杰瑞·马多克斯
Jerry Maddox?

696
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:05,942
你还记得汤姆三世告诉我们
You remember how Tom III told us that Stan

697
00:26:05,942 --> 00:26:07,467
斯坦去过贝西·辛克莱的葬礼吗
went to Betsy Sinclair's funeral?

698
00:26:07,477 --> 00:26:09,405
我在想  他为什么去那儿
I started thinking, why would he go?

699
00:26:09,405 --> 00:26:10,133
去调查啊
To do research.

700
00:26:10,133 --> 00:26:12,253
没错  可是调查谁呢
Right, but research on whom?

701
00:26:12,282 --> 00:26:14,075
于是我去了葬礼会客厅
So I stopped by the funeral parlor.

702
00:26:14,075 --> 00:26:16,453
结果发现斯坦与死者的友人杰瑞·马多克斯
Turns out that Stan spent an awful lot of time

703
00:26:16,453 --> 00:26:18,161
聊了好一段时间
with a friend of the deceased named Jerry Maddox.

704
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:19,225
而关键是
And get this--

705
00:26:19,225 --> 00:26:21,488
杰瑞曾是佩尼贝克俱乐部的老酒保
Jerry was the old bartender at the Pennybaker Club,

706
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:24,385
他大概是蓝蝴蝶最后一条有迹可循的线索
And probably the last living link to the Blue Butterfly.

707
00:26:24,385 --> 00:26:25,200
做的好  卡塞尔
Good job, Castle.

708
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,284
是吗
Yeah?

709
00:26:26,677 --> 00:26:27,578
是啊
Yeah.

710
00:26:29,362 --> 00:26:30,321
杰瑞
Jerry.

711
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,364
这是贝克特警探和卡塞尔先生
This is Detective Beckett and Mr. Castle.

712
00:26:32,374 --> 00:26:32,930
他们想聊聊
They wanted a word.

713
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,023
当然可以
Oh, yeah.

714
00:26:34,033 --> 00:26:36,315
你们想来点汤吗  自家炖的
You want some soup? It's homemade.

715
00:26:36,315 --> 00:26:38,492
我倒乐意来一碗  闻起来很香
Oh, I don't mind if I do. That smells delicious.

716
00:26:38,492 --> 00:26:41,446
不用  谢了  不必麻烦了
Uh, no, thank you. Actually, we're--we're all right.

717
00:26:45,618 --> 00:26:46,318
这首歌是不是
Am I hearing

718
00:26:46,318 --> 00:26:47,958
《我能给予你的只有爱》
"I Can't Give You Anything But Love"?

719
00:26:48,255 --> 00:26:49,569
没错  孩子
That's right, kid.

720
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:52,015
那也是这首歌最好的版本
That's the best version of that tune, too.

721
00:26:53,261 --> 00:26:54,671
你们不是来聊音乐的吧
You come here to talk music, did you?

722
00:26:54,671 --> 00:26:57,117
其实  我们是来调查斯坦·班克斯的谋杀案的
Actually, we're here to investigate Stan Bank's murder,

723
00:26:57,126 --> 00:26:58,738
我们想知道你是否在贝西·辛克莱的葬礼上
And we were wondering if you met him

724
00:26:58,738 --> 00:26:59,898
遇到过他
at Betsy Sinclair's funeral.

725
00:26:59,898 --> 00:27:01,663
是的  他  他被杀了吗
Yeah. He--he was murdered?

726
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:03,504
可怜的孩子
Poor kid.

727
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:06,861
他有没有提到一条叫做蓝蝴蝶的项链
Did he mention a necklace called the Blue Butterfly?

728
00:27:06,861 --> 00:27:09,958
当然  他问了我很多问题
Oh, sure. Asked me all kinds of questions.

729
00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:12,241
它可能在哪儿  之类的问题
Uh, where it might be, stuff like that,

730
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,034
可我那时只是个酒保
but I was just a bartender back then.

731
00:27:14,034 --> 00:27:15,904
我帮不上他
I-I wasn't much help.

732
00:27:17,324 --> 00:27:19,683
下面这个问题  可能听上去很奇怪
Now this might seem an odd question,

733
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,838
但在1947年  薇拉·莫奎恩和乔·弗林
But in 1947, do you remember when Vera Mulqueen

734
00:27:22,838 --> 00:27:24,286
被杀的事  你是否还记得
and Joe Flynn were murdered?

735
00:27:24,286 --> 00:27:26,732
当然  那在当时引起很大轰动
Of course. It was a big deal back then.

736
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:29,705
那家具乐部的所有者  丹普西
Dempsey, the fella that owned the club,

737
00:27:29,705 --> 00:27:31,642
残忍地枪杀了他们
shot them in cold blood.

738
00:27:32,064 --> 00:27:33,196
同一年  您还记不记得
The same year, do you remember

739
00:27:33,196 --> 00:27:35,363
有个名叫莎莉·斯科菲尔德的女人
a woman named sally scofield?

740
00:27:36,025 --> 00:27:36,888
她一头红发
She was a redhead.

741
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:39,257
1947年  她大概是18岁
In 1947, she would've been about 18.

742
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:41,731
我想我知道你在说谁了
Oh, I think I know who you're talking about.

743
00:27:41,731 --> 00:27:43,784
那是在46年
Now that's back in '46.

744
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,738
我刚被佩尼贝克雇用
I had just got hired at the Pennybaker.

745
00:27:52,942 --> 00:27:54,026
卖香烟啦  雪茄
Cigarettes. Cigars.

746
00:27:54,026 --> 00:27:56,011
那时丹普西还没跟薇拉在一起
Dempsey wasn't dating vera back then.

747
00:27:56,491 --> 00:28:00,020
他那时的女伴名叫普丽西拉·卡贝尔
He was going with a gal named Priscilla Campbell.

748
00:28:00,768 --> 00:28:02,370
普丽西拉有个女儿
Priscilla had a daughter,

749
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:05,132
名叫莎莉的红发女孩
a redhead named Sally.

750
00:28:05,257 --> 00:28:07,194
听起来她就是你说的那个
Sounds like she's the one you mean.

751
00:28:07,194 --> 00:28:09,093
后来发生的事  就是个悲剧
Sad story, what happened.

752
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:11,931
不久后  薇拉吸引了丹普西的视线
Not long after vera caught dempsey's eye,

753
00:28:11,931 --> 00:28:13,725
他抛弃了普丽西拉
he dropped Priscilla

754
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,758
无情地断绝了与她和莎莉的往来
and cut her and Sally off cold.

755
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,546
他们说这就是蓝蝴蝶的诅咒
They said it was the curse of the Blue Butterfly.

756
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:22,989
普丽西拉服药自杀了
Priscilla killed herself with a handful of pills.

757
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:24,476
莎莉呢
And Sally?

758
00:28:24,898 --> 00:28:26,806
几个月之后
Couple months after, uh,

759
00:28:26,845 --> 00:28:28,887
薇拉和那个私人侦探被杀
Vera and that P.I. got whacked,

760
00:28:30,057 --> 00:28:32,014
丹普西死于心脏病
Dempsey died of a heart attack.

761
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:33,913
他葬礼的那晚
The evening of his funeral,

762
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:36,703
莎莉盛装来到俱乐部
in walks Sally, all dressed up.

763
00:28:36,847 --> 00:28:38,343
点了一杯纯威士忌
Ordered a whiskey neat,

764
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:40,137
一干而尽
slammed it back,

765
00:28:40,357 --> 00:28:42,985
对我露齿冷笑
gave me a big ol' crocodile grin,

766
00:28:43,235 --> 00:28:44,827
说她自由了
Said she was free.

767
00:28:45,699 --> 00:28:47,982
然后昂首阔步地出了门
Then she strutted on out the door,

768
00:28:47,982 --> 00:28:50,188
那是我最后一次见到她
and that's the last time I ever saw her.

769
00:28:52,058 --> 00:28:53,631
这是个复仇的故事
It's a revenge story.

770
00:28:54,436 --> 00:28:56,728
莎莉将其母亲之死归罪于薇拉
Sally blamed Vera for the death of her mother,

771
00:28:56,738 --> 00:28:58,502
密谋杀害她
so she plotted to take her down.

772
00:28:58,992 --> 00:29:01,245
她利用私家侦探
Somehow she used the P.I. to do it.

773
00:29:01,245 --> 00:29:02,482
他俩肯定是被她陷害的
She must have been setting them up.

774
00:29:02,482 --> 00:29:04,247
是的  但这对找出杀害斯坦的凶手
Yeah, but how does any of this help us figure out

775
00:29:04,247 --> 00:29:05,494
有什么帮助吗
who shot Stan?

776
00:29:07,268 --> 00:29:08,381
那么
So...

777
00:29:08,419 --> 00:29:09,810
西区瓦利
West Side Wally.

778
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:10,970
能叫你瓦利吗
May I call you Wally?

779
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,351
我比较喜欢别人叫我西区
I prefer West Side.

780
00:29:12,361 --> 00:29:13,233
好吧
Of course.

781
00:29:13,233 --> 00:29:15,669
西区  我们知道两天前你在佩尼贝克俱乐部
West Side, we know you were at the Pennybaker Club two days ago.

782
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:17,415
我们发现了你的"窝"
Yeah, we found your squat.

783
00:29:17,415 --> 00:29:19,736
卡妮  蕾希  你们可以就此打住了
Cagney and Lacey, you can stop right there.

784
00:29:17,415 --> 00:29:19,736
《卡妮和蕾希》著名美剧  主人公是两位女警探

785
00:29:19,736 --> 00:29:21,567
两天前我没住在俱乐部
I wasn't living in the club two days ago.

786
00:29:21,567 --> 00:29:23,217
有人给我钱请我出去住
I had already gotten bought out by the other guy.

787
00:29:23,217 --> 00:29:24,665
-给你钱  -什么人
- Bought out? - By the other guy?

788
00:29:24,665 --> 00:29:25,835
几天前  有个人进来
A few days ago, the other guy comes in,

789
00:29:25,835 --> 00:29:27,283
开始在酒吧搭窝
starts setting up a squat by the bar,

790
00:29:27,283 --> 00:29:28,760
但西区瓦利不喜欢与人同住
but West Side Wally doesn't do neighbors.

791
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,937
于是我说"教授  滚远点"
So I said, "Hey, Professor, kick rocks."

792
00:29:31,014 --> 00:29:32,395
可他就是不走
He wouldn't take no for an answer.

793
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:34,697
反而给了四百刀让我另觅住所
Ended up paying me $400 to relocate.

794
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,519
重申一次  那天我不在
So again, for the record this time, I wasn't there.

795
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:38,888
冷静点  好吗  你知道那人叫什么吗
Easy, easy, okay. Did you get this guy's name?

796
00:29:38,888 --> 00:29:40,355
我没问  他也没说
I didn't ask. He didn't say.

797
00:29:40,393 --> 00:29:41,151
能描述下他的样子吗
Can you describe him?

798
00:29:41,151 --> 00:29:43,232
中等身高  不胖不瘦  白人  50岁左右
Medium height, medium build, white, 50s.

799
00:29:43,232 --> 00:29:44,834
我叫他教授
I called him the Professor

800
00:29:44,834 --> 00:29:47,260
他讲话就像个矫饰做作的蠢蛋
because he spoke like a pretentious jerk.

801
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,280
对  这不是教授嘛
Hey, it's the Professor.

802
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,815
克莱德·贝拉斯科
Clyde Belasco.

803
00:30:00,245 --> 00:30:02,950
我们知道你去过佩尼贝克俱乐部
We know that you were at the Pennybaker Club,

804
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:03,756
贝拉斯科先生
Mr. Belasco.

805
00:30:03,756 --> 00:30:05,309
你用钱把流浪汉打发走
You paid off a homeless man

806
00:30:05,309 --> 00:30:07,899
这样你就能独自占着那地方
so that you could have the place to yourself.

807
00:30:08,743 --> 00:30:10,661
我在上东区有处豪华公寓
I have a condo on the upper east side,

808
00:30:10,661 --> 00:30:12,080
在波尔多[法国西南部港市]有座城堡
a chateau in Bordeaux,

809
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,960
在格斯塔德[瑞士滑雪胜地]有座农舍
a chalet in Gstaad, and yet.

810
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,159
仅凭某个流浪汉的片面之词
On the word of some vagrant,

811
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:16,520
你就断定我用钱打发他
you believe that I paid to

812
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,621
好让自己在荒废的地方搭窝
squat in an abandoned building?

813
00:30:18,621 --> 00:30:21,057
我可是大名鼎鼎的克莱德·贝拉斯科
Me? Clyde Belasco?

814
00:30:21,066 --> 00:30:22,160
我们就是这个意思
Pretty much.

815
00:30:22,994 --> 00:30:24,806
先生  我倒想看看你怎么证明
I'd like to see you prove it, sir.

816
00:30:26,638 --> 00:30:28,355
好啊  教授  听你的
All right, have it your way, Professor.

817
00:30:28,365 --> 00:30:30,954
我们庭审宣判见吧
We will see you at the sentencing hearing.

818
00:30:31,098 --> 00:30:33,447
你可以在监狱里做你的电视节目
You can do your TV show from prison.

819
00:30:34,694 --> 00:30:35,701
等等
Wait.

820
00:30:36,372 --> 00:30:37,399
好吧我说
Okay.

821
00:30:37,763 --> 00:30:38,837
我承认  我在那
I was there. I admit it.

822
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,503
斯坦被杀之时我在佩尼贝克俱乐部
I was at the Pennybaker Club when Stan was killed.

823
00:30:41,503 --> 00:30:42,923
但他不是我杀的
But I didn't kill him.

824
00:30:42,932 --> 00:30:45,627
如我之前所说  斯坦来找我
Like I said before, Stan came to me

825
00:30:45,627 --> 00:30:47,325
问我要
and asked for my research

826
00:30:47,325 --> 00:30:49,080
蓝蝴蝶的研究报告
on the Blue Butterfly.

827
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:50,461
你拒绝了吗
And you said no?

828
00:30:50,461 --> 00:30:52,043
我当然拒绝了
Of course I said no.

829
00:30:52,053 --> 00:30:54,211
我花了15年的时间去找那条项链
I searched for that necklace for 15 years,

830
00:30:54,211 --> 00:30:56,119
而现在要我去帮他
and now I'm just supposed to help him?

831
00:30:56,129 --> 00:30:57,865
这份荣耀只属于我
The glory was to be mine.

832
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:59,859
但你知道他找到了线索  对吗
But you knew he was on to something, didn't you?

833
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:00,790
对
Oh, yes.

834
00:31:01,164 --> 00:31:03,274
我看得出他已离成功不远  非常接近
I could tell he was close, so very close.

835
00:31:03,274 --> 00:31:05,067
斯坦知道我从没听说过的
Stan knew things about the club, about the necklace

836
00:31:05,067 --> 00:31:06,784
关于俱乐部和项链的事
that I had never heard before.

837
00:31:06,784 --> 00:31:08,021
所以你在俱乐部那侯着
So you staked out the club,

838
00:31:08,021 --> 00:31:09,392
斯坦一出现 你就把他杀了
and when Stan showed, you shot him.

839
00:31:09,392 --> 00:31:11,521
探长  我没杀他
I didn't shoot him, Detective.

840
00:31:11,521 --> 00:31:14,130
我随身都带着把手枪和一条牛鞭
Yes, I had a pistol with me and a bullwhip.

841
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,192
它们就是我的标志  众所周知
They're my trademarks. Everyone knows that.

842
00:31:16,489 --> 00:31:17,995
但我还带了面具和手套
But I brought a mask and gloves as well

843
00:31:17,995 --> 00:31:19,616
我纯粹只想吓唬吓唬他
because I was simply going to threaten him

844
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:20,920
窃取他的成果
and take the prize.

845
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,368
后来呢
So then what happened?

846
00:31:23,692 --> 00:31:25,197
我躺在那等着他
I was lying in wait.

847
00:31:25,571 --> 00:31:28,074
斯坦下楼  当他回来的时候  他
Stan went downstairs, and when he returned, he was...

848
00:31:28,074 --> 00:31:30,031
手握蓝蝴蝶
holding the Blue Butterfly.

849
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:33,713
你们真该看看它有多璀璨
Oh, you should've seen how it sparkled.

850
00:31:34,251 --> 00:31:35,507
完美无瑕
Magnificent.

851
00:31:35,699 --> 00:31:37,761
我正打算扑抢的时候
I was about to pounce

852
00:31:37,761 --> 00:31:39,132
突然有人用布捂住我的嘴
when suddenly there was a-a rag put over my mouth.

853
00:31:39,132 --> 00:31:40,983
甜甜的味道
It had a sweet smell,

854
00:31:40,993 --> 00:31:43,381
布上好像洒了氯仿
like it was doused with chloroform.

855
00:31:43,496 --> 00:31:44,752
氯仿
Chloroform?

856
00:31:45,318 --> 00:31:46,900
-真的吗  -绝对是
- Really? - It had to be.

857
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:49,058
然后我眼前一黑  我醒来时
Everything went dark, and when I came to,

858
00:31:49,058 --> 00:31:50,564
斯坦已经死了
Stan was dead.

859
00:31:50,564 --> 00:31:51,695
我把他尸体搜了个遍
I searched his body,

860
00:31:51,695 --> 00:31:55,762
肯定是把我弄晕的人拿走了项链
but whoever knocked me out took the Blue Butterfly with them.

861
00:31:58,706 --> 00:31:59,569
我真希望是他
God, I hope it's him.

862
00:31:59,569 --> 00:32:00,595
我也是  但是他不认罪
Yeah, but without a confession,

863
00:32:00,595 --> 00:32:02,811
我们手上的都是间接证据
our case is purely circumstantial.

864
00:32:02,811 --> 00:32:05,314
我试试看能否拿到贝拉斯科住处的搜查令
I'm gonna see if I can get a warrant for Belasco's place.

865
00:32:05,314 --> 00:32:06,647
哪个住处  豪华公寓
Which place, the condo,

866
00:32:06,647 --> 00:32:08,220
城堡  还是农舍
the chateau, or the chalet?

867
00:32:08,738 --> 00:32:10,234
你好  我是凯特·贝克特探长
Hi, yeah, this is Detective Kate Beckett,

868
00:32:10,234 --> 00:32:10,809
12分局
12th Precint.

869
00:32:10,809 --> 00:32:12,775
找区检察官
I'm calling for the riding A.D.A.

870
00:32:14,415 --> 00:32:15,873
好的  我等着
Yeah. Okay. I'll hold.

871
00:32:16,381 --> 00:32:17,925
真令我失望
Well, it's kind of disappointing.

872
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:19,978
我多期盼侦破斯坦的凶杀案
I was really hoping that solving Stan's murder

873
00:32:19,978 --> 00:32:21,090
能给我点答案
would give us some answers

874
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:22,538
让我知道乔和薇拉身上到底发生了什么
to what really happened to Joe and Vera.

875
00:32:22,538 --> 00:32:24,264
但我们已经知道了
Yeah, but what we already know what really happened.

876
00:32:24,264 --> 00:32:25,655
丹普西把他们俩杀了
Dempsey killed them both.

877
00:32:25,684 --> 00:32:27,074
这是显而易见的
Well, that's obvious version.

878
00:32:27,074 --> 00:32:28,714
但莎莉呢
But what about Sally?

879
00:32:28,887 --> 00:32:31,352
她在整件事中扮演着什么角色  而且
What's her part in all of this? And...

880
00:32:32,061 --> 00:32:33,481
为何他会雇佣乔
why would she hire Joe?

881
00:32:34,114 --> 00:32:35,447
我想我们永远也不可能知道了
Well, I guess we'll never know.

882
00:32:35,562 --> 00:32:37,470
不  事情还没结束
No, something else was going on.

883
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,813
我们遗漏了些事
Something we're missing.

884
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:42,505
她穿着T字带斜面的鞋  穿着很土的衣服
"Wearing t-strap shoes and a country suit,

885
00:32:42,505 --> 00:32:44,845
我看得出红发女是个刚进城的乡巴佬
I could tell that redhead was a hick off the cob."

886
00:32:44,845 --> 00:32:46,265
等等  你刚说什么
Wait. What did you just say?

887
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:48,826
这是乔日记里对她的描述
Well, that's just how Joe described her in his diary.

888
00:32:48,826 --> 00:32:50,657
不  鞋那部分
No, the--the part about the shoes?

889
00:32:50,657 --> 00:32:52,825
T字带  就是鞋带绕过
T-strap. It's when the strap comes over the--

890
00:32:52,825 --> 00:32:55,203
我能待会再打给你吗
Yeah. Can I just call you back?

891
00:32:55,942 --> 00:32:56,862
好的
Okay.

892
00:32:58,176 --> 00:32:59,423
看看这张照片
Take a look at this photo.

893
00:32:59,423 --> 00:33:01,063
车旁边有只鞋
There's a shoe next to the car.

894
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:02,636
仔细看看那鞋的样式
And look at what kind of shoe it is.

895
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:05,014
T字带
That's a T-strap.

896
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:05,868
你不会想说
You don't think...

897
00:33:05,868 --> 00:33:07,316
如果薇拉当晚在俱乐部
If Vera was at the club that night,

898
00:33:07,316 --> 00:33:09,109
她会身着礼服
she'd be dressed in an elegant dress and...

899
00:33:09,109 --> 00:33:11,114
高跟鞋  死的不是薇拉
And heels. This isn't Vera.

900
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,216
死的是莎莉
This is Sally.

901
00:33:12,216 --> 00:33:13,147
也不可能是莎莉
Yeah, but it can't be Sally.

902
00:33:13,147 --> 00:33:16,072
酒保说案发后几个月他还见过莎莉
The bartender said that he saw her months after the murders.

903
00:33:16,302 --> 00:33:18,000
-除非他说谎  -他说谎
- Unless... he lied. - He lied.

904
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,352
但那是半个多世纪前的事了
But that was over half a century ago.

905
00:33:19,352 --> 00:33:20,551
他为何如此
Why would he lie about that?

906
00:33:20,551 --> 00:33:22,622
贝克特  我刚刚意识到一件事
Beckett, I just realized something.

907
00:33:22,622 --> 00:33:24,348
《我能给予你的只有爱》
"I Can't Give You Anything But Love."

908
00:33:25,653 --> 00:33:26,218
什么意思
W-what?

909
00:33:26,218 --> 00:33:28,885
我们询问酒保时  播放的那首歌
That's what was playing when we interviewed the bartender.

910
00:33:28,904 --> 00:33:30,170
对  我想起来了
Right. Right.

911
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:33,306
他说那是这首歌最好的版本
He said that that was the best version of the song.

912
00:33:33,315 --> 00:33:35,329
这是路易斯·阿姆斯特朗[美国爵士歌手]的版本
It was Louis Armstrong's version.

913
00:33:35,329 --> 00:33:38,130
乔的日记里  他说他最爱的歌手是沙奇摩
In Joe's diary, he says his favorite performer is Satchmo.

914
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:39,597
沙奇摩的真名是
What's Satchmo's real name?

915
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:40,556
路易斯·阿姆斯特朗
Louis Armstrong.

916
00:33:40,556 --> 00:33:41,918
全部联系起来
Put it all together,

917
00:33:42,139 --> 00:33:43,395
答案很明晰了
the answer is clear.

918
00:33:46,771 --> 00:33:48,833
又见面了
Oh. Hello again.

919
00:33:49,034 --> 00:33:50,099
薇拉你好
Hello, Vera.

920
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,311
乔你好
And hello, Joe.

921
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:02,998
薇拉·莫奎恩和乔·弗林
Well, if it isn't Vera Mulqueen and Joe Flynn,

922
00:34:02,998 --> 00:34:04,455
起死回生
back from the dead.

923
00:34:04,455 --> 00:34:05,817
一切都好吗
Everything all right, guys?

924
00:34:05,817 --> 00:34:08,522
一切都好  多谢关心  弗兰基
Everything's peachy. Thanks, Frankie.

925
00:34:08,522 --> 00:34:11,476
怎么回事  斯坦发现真相了吗
What happened? Stan figured out the truth,

926
00:34:11,725 --> 00:34:13,269
发现你俩还活着
that you two were alive,

927
00:34:13,269 --> 00:34:14,660
发现你们为了偷走蓝蝴蝶
that you murdered two people

928
00:34:14,669 --> 00:34:16,722
而杀了两个人吗
so you could disappear with the Blue Butterfly?

929
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:19,052
于是你们就把他骗到俱乐部然后杀了他吗
So you lured him to the club and then you shot him?

930
00:34:19,062 --> 00:34:20,730
小姐  你的推测全错了
Lady, you got it all wrong.

931
00:34:21,258 --> 00:34:22,936
斯坦在贝西的葬礼上缠住了我
Stan cornered me at Betsy's funeral,

932
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:24,547
想知道我是怎么认识她的
wanting to know how I knew her.

933
00:34:24,547 --> 00:34:27,597
于是我只好骗他说我是当时的酒保
So I lied and told him I was a bartender.

934
00:34:27,875 --> 00:34:29,995
但是斯坦很聪明  他太聪明了
But Stan was clever. He was too clever.

935
00:34:29,995 --> 00:34:30,963
他把我们识破了
He figured us out.

936
00:34:30,963 --> 00:34:32,536
他跑来这里逼我们说出
He came here demanding to know

937
00:34:32,536 --> 00:34:34,109
蓝蝴蝶的下落
where the Blue Butterfly was.

938
00:34:34,109 --> 00:34:36,085
他威胁说要告发我们
He threatened to expose us.

939
00:34:36,334 --> 00:34:38,060
他不达目的绝不善罢甘休
He was like a dog after a bone.

940
00:34:38,616 --> 00:34:40,458
所以我们就满足了他的要求
So we told him what he needed to know.

941
00:34:40,515 --> 00:34:41,954
我们把蓝蝴蝶的下落告诉他了
We told him where it was.

942
00:34:42,635 --> 00:34:44,045
但是我们并没有杀他
But we didn't kill him.

943
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:45,253
得了  伙计们
Oh, come on, you guys.

944
00:34:45,253 --> 00:34:46,116
肯定是你们俩干的
We know it's you.

945
00:34:46,116 --> 00:34:48,964
你们用了1947年犯案的同一把枪
You used the same gun from the '47 murders to kill Stan.

946
00:34:48,964 --> 00:34:51,391
同一把枪  我们一直把那把枪放在
Same gun? Oh, we keep that gun in the --

947
00:34:51,391 --> 00:34:52,868
装瓷器的碗橱里
The china cabinet drawer.

948
00:34:53,702 --> 00:34:55,217
你想都别想
Don't even think about it.

949
00:34:55,946 --> 00:34:57,145
把枪放下
Put the gun down.

950
00:34:58,823 --> 00:35:01,058
弗兰西斯·本杰明·亨特沙克
Francis Benjamin Huntsacker,

951
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:02,286
你都干了什么呀
what have you done?

952
00:35:02,286 --> 00:35:03,628
等一下  亨特沙克
Wait a minute. Huntsacker?

953
00:35:04,731 --> 00:35:06,889
正是你母亲把那本日记卖给了斯坦
It was your mother who sold the diary to Stan.

954
00:35:07,311 --> 00:35:07,953
什么日记
What diary?

955
00:35:07,953 --> 00:35:09,008
你的日记
Your diary.

956
00:35:09,267 --> 00:35:10,504
这么说你看过那本日记
So you read it,

957
00:35:10,543 --> 00:35:12,557
而一直以来你也在寻找那条项链的下落
and all this time, you were looking for the necklace, too.

958
00:35:12,557 --> 00:35:14,552
不然我为什么干这烂工作
That's why I got this crap job.

959
00:35:14,552 --> 00:35:16,662
六个月以来  我慢慢使你们信任我
And for six months, I slowly built trust,

960
00:35:16,662 --> 00:35:17,927
渐渐地从你们的嘴里套话
gently acquired information.

961
00:35:17,927 --> 00:35:19,759
结果那混蛋就这么闯进来
And then that jerk just waltzes in here

962
00:35:19,759 --> 00:35:21,610
逼你们说出了项链的下落
and bullies the location of the Blue Butterfly from you?

963
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:22,464
拜托
Come on!

964
00:35:22,464 --> 00:35:24,478
当你意识到这是最后的机会时
So when you realized it was now or never,

965
00:35:24,478 --> 00:35:26,396
你伏击了斯坦
you bushwhacked Stan,

966
00:35:26,396 --> 00:35:27,997
然后抢走了蓝蝴蝶
took the Blue Butterfly for yourself?

967
00:35:27,997 --> 00:35:30,184
我带上枪就是为了以防万一
I brought their old .38 only as a precaution.

968
00:35:30,184 --> 00:35:32,006
我只想把斯坦迷晕然后从他那偷走蓝蝴蝶
I was just gonna chloroform Stan and steal it.

969
00:35:32,016 --> 00:35:34,538
但你却发现克莱德·贝拉斯科藏在吧台后面
But you found Clyde Belasco hiding behind the bar.

970
00:35:34,538 --> 00:35:37,012
我拔出了枪  斯坦冲了上来
I pulled the gun, Stan grabbed for it...

971
00:35:37,895 --> 00:35:39,122
听着  我不是故意的
Look, I didn't mean to.

972
00:35:40,091 --> 00:35:42,153
走吧  弗兰基  你被捕了
Let's go, Frankie. You're under arrest.

973
00:35:48,502 --> 00:35:50,285
卡塞尔  你猜我们在弗兰基的公寓里
Hey, Castle, guess what we found

974
00:35:50,285 --> 00:35:52,184
找到了什么
at Frankie's apartment.

975
00:35:56,817 --> 00:35:58,092
天啊
Oh, my.

976
00:35:58,514 --> 00:35:59,962
天啊
Oh, my god.

977
00:36:01,727 --> 00:36:03,002
太美了
It's beautiful.

978
00:36:04,009 --> 00:36:05,457
-是个赝品  -你说什么
- It's fake.  - What?

979
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:06,819
我们已经把它拿去鉴定过了
We confirmed it with an appraiser.

980
00:36:06,819 --> 00:36:08,785
这只是手工精良的人造珠宝而已
It's well-crafted costume jewelry.

981
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,260
这么多人费了这么大劲  就为这吗
All this time, and it's paste?

982
00:36:11,835 --> 00:36:12,794
这还真是
That's...

983
00:36:13,523 --> 00:36:15,182
又或者峰回路转又一村
Or maybe it's a twist on a twist.

984
00:36:15,182 --> 00:36:16,228
也许真正的蓝蝴蝶
Maybe the real Blue Butterfly

985
00:36:16,228 --> 00:36:17,781
在多年前就被人掉包了
was switched out for this one years ago.

986
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:19,642
不管怎样  摆在我们面前的事实都是一样的
Well, whatever happened, it doesn't change the facts.

987
00:36:19,642 --> 00:36:22,049
我们还有案子没结呢
We still have one more case to close.

988
00:36:24,773 --> 00:36:26,058
现在我们知道
Okay, so now we know

989
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:27,525
杀害斯坦的凶手是弗兰基
that Frankie killed Stan,

990
00:36:27,525 --> 00:36:30,575
但是我们还有两宗谋杀案未破呢
but there are still two murders that need to be solved --

991
00:36:30,575 --> 00:36:33,931
也就是莎莉·坎贝尔和被你们丢在汽车里的另一具尸体
Sally Campbell and whoever else you put in that car.

992
00:36:33,931 --> 00:36:36,089
你们现在该老实交代1947年6月24日的晚上
It's time you come clean on what happened

993
00:36:36,089 --> 00:36:38,842
到底发生了什么
the evening of June 24, 1947,

994
00:36:39,033 --> 00:36:40,606
也就是你们失踪的那晚
The night you disappeared.

995
00:36:42,572 --> 00:36:43,666
告诉他们吧  薇拉
Tell them, Vera.

996
00:36:43,781 --> 00:36:46,610
我们都挤在收音机前
We were all huddled around the, uh, radio, listening to

997
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:50,168
收听舒格·雷·罗宾逊对战吉米·度耶的职业拳击赛
the Sugar Ray Robinson VS Jimmy Doyle prizefight, and, uh,

998
00:36:50,245 --> 00:36:52,364
而我一直在为逃跑的计划而坐立不安
I was building up nerve to make my escape.

999
00:36:52,364 --> 00:36:53,659
将两人分开
...breaks up the clinch.

1000
00:36:54,014 --> 00:36:57,083
渐渐疲劳的吉米·度耶挥出一记左拳  又是一拳
A slowly tiring Jimmy Doyle throws a left, another left.

1001
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:59,509
接下来是罗宾逊
Here comes Robinson.

1002
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:02,070
一记左拳  一记右拳  又一记左拳
A left. A right. Another left...

1003
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,921
莫克西  我要去洗手间
Moxie, I need to powder my nose.

1004
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,704
你开什么玩笑  非得现在去吗
Are you kidding me? Can it wait?

1005
00:37:05,704 --> 00:37:06,596
对
No.

1006
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:08,514
听你的  老板
Ah, what do you say, boss?

1007
00:37:09,819 --> 00:37:11,411
好吧  快去快回
Yeah, yeah, yeah, make it quick.

1008
00:37:11,411 --> 00:37:13,060
罗宾逊改变策略
Robinson regroups.

1009
00:37:14,249 --> 00:37:16,800
罗宾逊挥出一记左拳  右拳  接着又是一记左拳
Robinson delivers a left, a right, a left again.

1010
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,284
度耶回击  但却被罗宾逊躲了过去
Doyle punches back, but missed him by a mile.

1011
00:37:25,403 --> 00:37:27,053
真是天作之合呀
Well, aren't you a picture?

1012
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:28,827
你是谁
Who are you?

1013
00:37:28,827 --> 00:37:29,882
我是她男人
I'm with her.

1014
00:37:30,476 --> 00:37:31,244
把手举起来
Put 'em up.

1015
00:37:31,244 --> 00:37:33,219
那家伙是莎莉的丈夫
The guy was Sally's husband.

1016
00:37:33,219 --> 00:37:35,588
她雇用乔只是为了把我从丹普西身边带走
She'd only hired Joe to get me away from Dempsey

1017
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:37,765
她好实施她的复仇计划
so she could exact her revenge.

1018
00:37:37,765 --> 00:37:39,923
现在该让你尝尝我母亲所受的苦了
Now you're gonna suffer, Vera, like my mother suffered.

1019
00:37:39,923 --> 00:37:42,551
等一下  莎莎  我先去拿项链
Wait, Sal. Let me get the ice first.

1020
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,080
不
No!

1021
00:37:46,339 --> 00:37:47,442
兰尼
Lenny!

1022
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,830
你干吗
Ugh! What are you doing?

1023
00:37:49,849 --> 00:37:51,096
把枪给我
Give me the gun!

1024
00:37:56,505 --> 00:37:58,269
乔
Oh! Joe!

1025
00:37:58,269 --> 00:37:59,142
我们本就深陷泥潭
We were hot as a pistol

1026
00:37:59,142 --> 00:38:01,271
这下我们手上又多了两条人命
and -- and we had two bodies on our hands,

1027
00:38:01,271 --> 00:38:02,815
我们不得不想点办法
And we had to do something.

1028
00:38:04,503 --> 00:38:05,510
而乔
And Joe...

1029
00:38:06,124 --> 00:38:07,304
想出了一个完美计划
had the plan.

1030
00:38:14,352 --> 00:38:16,318
没人会去寻找那两个人的下落
No one would be looking for those two.

1031
00:38:17,575 --> 00:38:19,311
而我们正好需要消失
We needed to disappear.

1032
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,641
显然  我们隐藏的不够好
Obviously, we didn't disappear far enough.

1033
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,125
那么
So...

1034
00:38:36,046 --> 00:38:38,041
你要逮捕我们吗
are you going to arrest us?

1035
00:38:46,298 --> 00:38:47,497
我逮捕你们干吗
Why would I do that?

1036
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:49,204
听上去你们是在自卫
Sounds like self-defense.

1037
00:38:49,242 --> 00:38:50,010
再说
Besides...

1038
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:51,880
我们要找的是一个叫做薇拉
we're looking for a woman named Vera,

1039
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,925
而不是维奥拉
not Viola,

1040
00:38:53,568 --> 00:38:55,342
要找的是私家侦探乔
And a P.I. named Joe,

1041
00:38:55,486 --> 00:38:57,787
而不是前酒保杰瑞
not a former bartender named Jerry.

1042
00:38:58,535 --> 00:39:00,367
我们真不知道该怎么感谢你们
We don't know how to thank you.

1043
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:02,947
我知道
I do.

1044
00:39:04,155 --> 00:39:05,565
回答我两个问题
Answer two questions.

1045
00:39:06,975 --> 00:39:08,001
第一
One...

1046
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,945
拿到了蓝蝴蝶  为什么没带走
if you had the Blue Butterfly, why didn't you take it?

1047
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:12,691
第二
And two...

1048
00:39:13,496 --> 00:39:15,165
它到底在哪儿
where has it been all this time?

1049
00:39:15,165 --> 00:39:17,294
我们本来是要拿走蓝蝴蝶的  可这位美人
Well, we were home free till doll face here

1050
00:39:17,294 --> 00:39:18,953
突然间顿悟了
had herself an epiphany.

1051
00:39:19,606 --> 00:39:21,533
这东西的确是被诅咒了
This thing really is cursed.

1052
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:23,423
薇拉  那只是吊在绳子上的漂亮石头而已
Vera, that's just fancy rocks on a pretty rope.

1053
00:39:23,423 --> 00:39:25,197
不  不只是石头
No, it's more than that.

1054
00:39:25,206 --> 00:39:27,345
是苦痛的源头  乔  我们不能带走它
It's misery. Joe, we can't.

1055
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:29,733
我不在乎这东西
I got no love for this thing,

1056
00:39:30,049 --> 00:39:30,999
我爱的只有你
Just you.

1057
00:39:31,354 --> 00:39:31,968
但是我也决不会
But I'll be damned

1058
00:39:31,968 --> 00:39:34,077
让这东西再落到丹普西手里
if I let Dempsey get his hands back on it.

1059
00:39:50,496 --> 00:39:51,877
那混蛋这辈子都不会知道
Let the bastard spend the rest of his life

1060
00:39:51,877 --> 00:39:54,706
他的宝贝就藏在他的眼皮底下
not knowing his prize possession is right under his nose.

1061
00:40:01,727 --> 00:40:04,105
抛开诅咒不提  你们没想过回去拿回来吗
Cursed or not, did you ever consider going back for it?

1062
00:40:05,006 --> 00:40:06,925
他们还是不明白  乔
They don't get it, Joe.

1063
00:40:07,241 --> 00:40:08,641
我
Mm. I...

1064
00:40:08,651 --> 00:40:10,377
我们有四个孩子
We got four children,

1065
00:40:10,377 --> 00:40:11,969
七个孙子孙女
seven grandchildren,

1066
00:40:11,969 --> 00:40:13,561
两个曾孙曾孙女
two great-grandchildren...

1067
00:40:14,674 --> 00:40:15,287
还有彼此
and each other.

1068
00:40:17,685 --> 00:40:19,776
我们要蓝蝴蝶干吗
What do we need a Blue Butterfly for?

1069
00:40:24,916 --> 00:40:26,614
你觉得我们是不是应该把蓝蝴蝶的真相
Do you think we should've told Joe and Vera

1070
00:40:26,614 --> 00:40:28,033
告诉乔和薇拉
about the Blue Butterfly?

1071
00:40:28,033 --> 00:40:30,057
不  何必毁了这一切呢
Oh, no. Why ruin it for them?

1072
00:40:30,459 --> 00:40:32,416
梦想就是用来干这个的
No, that's the stuff that dreams are made of.

1073
00:40:36,492 --> 00:40:37,844
说你爱我  乔
Tell me you love me, Joe.

1074
00:40:38,045 --> 00:40:39,004
我会永远爱你
Always.
