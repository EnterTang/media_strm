1
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:03,587
Oh, dear.

2
00:00:03,796 --> 00:00:06,549
Penny, have you been recording
shows on our DVR again?

3
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:10,886
- No.
- Answer honestly. This is not a trial.

4
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:13,305
That will come later.

5
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,516
Absolutely not.

6
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:18,644
Help me out here.
I can't afford another demerit.

7
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:24,567
Uh, maybe we were hacked. The Chinese
have been hacking everything lately.

8
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:29,655
Why would the Chinese make our DVR
record Paul Blart: Mall Cop?

9
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:32,950
I don't know.

10
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:35,911
It's a fat guy on a Segway.
That's funny everywhere.

11
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:39,165
- I'm deleting it.
- Hang on.

12
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:42,168
Maybe the Chinese
haven't finished watching it yet.

13
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,255
If you're trying to make space on the DVR...

14
00:00:46,464 --> 00:00:50,468
...why don't you get rid of stuff
you've already watched? Like Alphas.

15
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:53,262
No, that's the season-two finale.
Quite the cliffhanger.

16
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:55,806
I'm gonna rewatch it
before season three starts.

17
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:57,933
There's no season three.
They canceled that show.

18
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:04,732
Well, they can't cancel it.
It ended on a cliffhanger.

19
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:06,859
Well, they did.

20
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,861
There are two dumplings left.
Want them?

21
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,156
Dumplings? Don't you understand
what's going on here?

22
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:14,241
As a rule, no.

23
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:18,954
That show ended with all the residents
of New York either dead or unconscious.

24
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:21,499
Now I'll never know what happened.

25
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,542
Why don't you make up
your own ending?

26
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:26,003
Oh. Sure, what a wonderful idea.

27
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:29,215
And after that I'll make up my own rules
of oral hygiene...

28
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,510
...and instead of flossing,
I'll rub pudding on my gums.

29
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:35,387
I'm gonna get the number of
the Syfy Channel and give them what for.

30
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,139
Oh, please don't do that.

31
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:39,850
No. They can't just cancel
a show like Alphas.

32
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:42,144
They have to help the viewers let go.

33
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:44,855
Firefly did a movie to wrap things up.

34
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:48,025
Buffy the Vampire Slayer
continued on as a comic book.

35
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:51,362
Heroes gradually lowered the quality
season by season...

36
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,405
...until we were grateful it ended.

37
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,492
I feel bad for whoever gets that phone call.

38
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,912
Ah, don't. If they didn't wanna be
yelled at by crazy nerds...

39
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,331
...they shouldn't have started
a sci-fi channel.

40
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:30,150
I think you're gonna be really happy
with this security camera.

41
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,903
The optics are great.
It's got infrared technology.

42
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:36,490
And there's even a backup battery
when the power goes out.

43
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:39,952
Whatever. I can see my little princess
while I'm at work, right?

44
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:44,290
Why can't you watch porn
like a regular guy?

45
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:49,461
Give me your laptop so I can
configure the software.

46
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,755
Hold on. This is weird.

47
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:53,007
What?

48
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:56,010
I was Googling that girl I've been dating
and found her blog.

49
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:58,178
Cool. Anything juicy?

50
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:01,557
She said she recently went
on a date with a guy named Roger.

51
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,603
And he's Indian.

52
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:08,731
And he's an astrophysicist too!

53
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,777
- You know what's going on, don't you?
- Yes.

54
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:17,823
Mommy was right.
American girls are sexually voracious devils.

55
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:22,286
I can't believe I have to explain this.
People change names on blogs...

56
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:26,290
...to protect their privacy. "Roger" is Raj.

57
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:27,875
Oh.

58
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,545
I always thought if I had a white name,
it would be Gavin.

59
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:36,550
- Keep reading. What does it say?
- No, I don't know if I should.

60
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:39,553
If she wanted me to know about her blog,
she would've told me.

61
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:43,641
- It's almost like I'm reading her diary.
- It's exactly what it's like. Keep reading.

62
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,809
No, this is creepy.

63
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:50,522
Oh.... I think we were looking at creepy in the
rearview mirror when I put up that camera.

64
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:55,152
It's not creepy. Don't listen to him.

65
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:59,406
(IN BABY-TALK VOICE)
Ooh, who's got the sweetest kisses?

66
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:01,617
(SMOOCHING)

67
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,667
Should I go?

68
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,217
With all the TV Sheldon was talking about,
I had the greatest idea ever.

69
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:22,429
It blows away my idea for a Star Wars-themed
coffee shop called Brewbacca's.

70
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:28,686
You need to watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
The perfect show for the two of us.

71
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:32,982
It's got action and jokes and hot vampires
and romance. I cannot oversell this.

72
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,525
What do you say?

73
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:37,194
It's 6:30 in the morning.

74
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:41,865
LEONARD:
I thought you grew up on a farm.

75
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:49,790
Hello, Syfy Network,
this is your vice president of programming.

76
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:53,961
We have made a horrible mistake
regarding Alphas.

77
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,964
We need to uncancel it immediately.

78
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:59,258
Put me through
to the people who handle that.

79
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,386
Tell them it's me.
I don't wanna answer a lot of questions...

80
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,430
...about if I really am who I say I am.

81
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,182
I just... I want this done.

82
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:10,310
No, I'm not the person who just called.

83
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,690
That man was clearly a cowboy...

84
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:18,110
...concerned about y'all
canceling his favorite show.

85
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,906
Why do they keep hanging up on me?

86
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:24,533
I'm sorry you're upset.

87
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:30,456
Sheldon, sometimes people seek the comfort
of physical contact in moments like this.

88
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:39,465
I am not flying back to Texas
just so my mom can give me a hug.

89
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,386
Okay. Well, what I think is going on here...

90
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:47,306
...is you have a pathological need
for closure.

91
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,558
Oh. That's nonsense.

92
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:53,812
You tell me stories about your day
all the time. I don't care how they end.

93
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:58,901
You know, I might be able
to help you with this.

94
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,820
There's a field of behavioral neuroscience
that examines...

95
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:05,532
...ways to retrain your neural pathways
so stuff like this bothers you less.

96
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:08,494
But I just told you,
I don't have a problem with closure.

97
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:11,330
- You sure about that?
- Quite sure.

98
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:24,635
That proves nothing.

99
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:31,183
- Ready to go to lunch?
- Do you think I'm feminine?

100
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:36,146
- Yeah, let's go.
- Thanks a lot.

101
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:40,317
- What's going on?
- I broke down and I read Lucy's blog.

102
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:44,696
In one of the entries she said when we
first met, I struck her as a little feminine.

103
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:47,991
Just a little? That's great.

104
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:50,369
I have to talk to her about this.

105
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,205
Ahh. Jeez, why do you girls always want
to talk about things?

106
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,544
Listen to me, if she's writing about
your relationship, use it to your advantage.

107
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:01,839
- Rig the game.
- That doesn't seem fair.

108
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:06,510
Is it fair that girls like confident,
normal guys more than nervous weirdos?

109
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,054
No, it's not.
I've always thought that was unfair.

110
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:14,518
So take what's in that blog
and use it to get her pants off.

111
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:18,480
Why do you make everything filthy?
Why couldn't you say the blog is like...

112
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:20,649
...her giving me the key to her heart?

113
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:24,027
"The key to her heart." Heh. That's nice.

114
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:27,698
Were you quoting someone
or is it tattooed on the small of your back?

115
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:33,620
I was quoting a man who knows a thing
or two about women: Sir Elton John.

116
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,502
("BUFFY THE VAMPIRE PLAYER" THEME
PLAYING ON TV)

117
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:47,968
So did you love it? Of course you
loved it. Tell me how much you loved it.

118
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:49,261
It was cute.

119
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,725
Aw, don't say "cute." That's the worst.

120
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,811
- What's wrong with cute?
- It just makes things seem small.

121
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,396
It diminishes them.

122
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:02,858
So you want me to stop calling
your little tushy cute?

123
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:06,028
You can try,
but nobody's gonna believe you.

124
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:12,201
I don't understand how you can watch
a show that great and not be excited by it.

125
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:15,996
- I liked it. I'm excited.
- Well, then tell your face.

126
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:20,334
- What do you want from me?
- You know what? Never mind.

127
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,502
We gave it a shot.
Let's just see what else is on.

128
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:26,840
Oh, come on, don't be like that.
I'm sorry I called it cute.

129
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:28,592
- Let's watch another one.
- Really?

130
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,762
Yeah. It was fun.
It kind of reminded me of my high school.

131
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,390
But instead of vampires,
we had meth-heads. Ahem.

132
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:39,603
But both came out at night
and had messed up teeth.

133
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:42,564
All right, cool.
I think you'll like the next one better.

134
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:45,234
All the cheerleaders
are suffering from an evil curse.

135
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,653
Oh. Well, that's like my high school too.

136
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,948
But instead of a curse, it was crabs. Heh.

137
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:58,121
I've come up with a series of exercises
to help with your compulsive need for closure.

138
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,416
I take issue with the word "compulsive."

139
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:08,173
All I'm saying is we live in a world
where closure isn't always an op...

140
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:20,602
...tion! Okay!

141
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:25,524
For the sake of argument,
let's say I have a problem.

142
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,609
What would be your plan
for addressing it?

143
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:30,153
I'm going to recondition your brain...

144
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:34,700
...so that the need for completion
isn't so overwhelming.

145
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:39,955
- By playing tic-tac-toe?
- Yep, your turn.

146
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:43,875
Oh, Amy. And you wonder why
people think neuroscience...

147
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,378
...is nothing but a goofy game
for diaper babies.

148
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:51,508
Tic-tac-toe can only end
in win, lose or draw.

149
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:56,388
None of which will deny me closure,

152
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,450
The same way
any normal person would.

153
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:20,537

tear it in two and then again and again...

with this treatment.

Yeah. Or you could pitch in, grab a nostril
and help me get this face off.

Come on. You can do this.

You don't know what it's like
to feel completely frustrated.

159

To have a desire build up within you
and be denied any opportunity for release.

Well, sure.
I'm pretty passionate about science.

171

I remember the first time I looked through
a microscope and saw tiny microorganisms.
