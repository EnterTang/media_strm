4
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,910
need a new love?

5
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,360
Hey,I'm ready

6
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,240
want my time?

7
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,030
I'm willing,yeah

8
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,020
'cause I'm the one

9
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,130
who's gonna show

10
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,310
when there's nobody

11
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,640
I'll be your man

12
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,000
yeah,I'm the one

13
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,110
who's gonna show

14
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,990
when there's nobody

15
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,530
I'll be your man

16
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,650
I'll be your man

17
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,430
all right.

18
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,750
- ray,you awake?
- Huh?

19
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,570
- Ray,are you there?

20
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,840
Are you asleep?

21
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,470
- Ray?
- Huh?

22
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,850
Ray oh!

23
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,440
Ray!

24
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,100
Ray,my apartment is infested with flies.

25
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,040
- What?

26
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,360
- Ray,six fat big ones.

27
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,440
- They were pudgy.

28
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,890
It is not a good sign.

29
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,210
You afraid of flies or something?

30
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,040
What would you think if
your house which previously

31
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,110
had no flies was suddenly
filled with flies?

32
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,470
I'd think I had a dead
rat under the floorboards.

33
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,530
That's not helpful.

34
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,260
No.

35
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:08,400
The universe is definitely-- -
it's trying to tell me something.

36
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,370
- Like what?
- Like I'm dead meat,ray.

37
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,280
- Do you know what I mean?
- No.

38
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,020
Dead meat.

39
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,390
Like stick a fork in me,I'm done.

40
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,620
Like,my boyfriend's
disappeared somewhere in cuba,

41
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,710
and there's all these
flies and now I just

42
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,970
I'm afraid you're gonna
disappear on me too.

43
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,990
Is that true?

44
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,020
Is it?

45
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,810
I'm not going anywhere.

46
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,800
I'm still your pimp?

47
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,840
I'm not dead meat?

48
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,360
You are not dead meat.

49
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,510
oh my god.

50
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,510
Look around you,ray.

51
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,640
Most of these women have more money
than they know what to do with.

52
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:58,120
And their husbands are either too
old or too busy to get erections.

53
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,670
okay.

54
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,530
How do you know that?

55
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,180
They tell me.

56
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,360
- Ready to order,mrs.Eggloff?
- Not yet,doll.

57
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,270
Mrs.Eggloff?

58
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,870
Oh,that's my maiden name.

59
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,970
Oh,you were married?

60
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,520
No.

61
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,890
See that woman over there?

62
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:24,760
That is a very horny lady in particular.

63
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,840
Her tip alone would
be extremely generous.

64
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,960
Do you want a date with her on friday?

65
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,070
I-- I
mean...

66
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,010
what about tanya?

67
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,980
What about tanya?

68
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,570
The pimp job,it means a lot to her.

69
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,920
Well,winning miss
michigan meant a lot to me,

70
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,030
but I had to realize
that wasn't my destiny.

71
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,280
God,you're so loyal,ray.

72
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:51,130
You're like a golden retriever.

73
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:55,270
Look,I know you think
tanya's minor leagues,

74
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:59,000
but okay,she has some flaws.

75
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,130
But we can't just cut her loose.

76
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,180
Sure we can.

77
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,330
This is capitalism.

78
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,330
How about we form a partnership?

79
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,910
You know,like a team.

80
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,730
Tanya dilutes the franchise.

81
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,690
You're either with
me or you're with her.

82
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,740
It's time to choose.

83
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,290
Why did I feel so guilty about tanya?

84
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,760
I tried to just focus on the house.

85
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,290
I almost had the whole
place ready to get rewired.

86
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,800
And then...

87
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,870
honey.

88
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,240
Who knows where the bees went?

89
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,120
I felt like the butt of a cosmic joke.

90
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,590
Hey,mike.

91
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,480
You ever hear about people
getting honey in their walls?

92
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,640
Honey.

93
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,980
You know,like from a beehive.

94
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,270
I don't know what
you're talking about,man.

95
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,360
You all right?

96
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,090
No,ray.I'm worried about the list.

97
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,090
What list?

98
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,570
Joe says that there's a list
of everybody getting fired.

99
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,140
He says my name is on it.

100
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,450
What?Who's they?

101
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,910
Quit worrying about this rumor crap,man.

102
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,390
You want me to go talk to
rhonda so you can calm down?

103
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,680
- Yeah,would you?
- Yeah.

104
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,330
- I need some answers,man.
- All right.

105
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,330
Do you do this a lot?

106
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,690
Every week.

107
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,420
These guys really open you up.

108
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,970
Feels a little,uh...

109
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,270
personal.

110
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,180
You look glum.

111
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,870
No,I'm okay.

112
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,030
I read people for a living,jessica.

113
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,240
What's on your mind?

114
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,080
Okay,you know how you
said that I have the power?

115
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,850
You do.

116
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:55,270
Well,it felt really great
when I said it,but now I don't

117
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,960
I don't feel like I have it.

118
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,380
Maybe you're just a girl who doesn't
know how to get what she wants.

119
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,250
No,I know how to get what I want.

120
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,150
I do.

121
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,900
I really go for it.

122
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,350
Then what's the problem?

123
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,720
It's just that once I get it...

124
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,180
I forget.

125
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,420
I forget why I really wanted it.

126
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,180
I think the first thing you've got
to do is take charge of your pussy.

127
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,680
Come on.

128
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,220
your vagina is like
a car battery,jessica.

129
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,410
You've got to keep it charged.

130
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,400
If the battery dies,you become weak.

131
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,620
- And whiny.
- Okay,really?

132
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,100
I don't know what you're talking about.

133
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,600
I'm saying you could use a jump.

134
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,740
how often do you screw your husband?

135
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,570
it varies.

136
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,140
How many times was he
inside you last week?

137
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,570
Last week...

138
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,180
zero.

139
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,980
Zero?

140
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,200
All right,that's a fucking shame.

141
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,240
You've got to have a husband
who wants to fuck you.

142
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:06,150
No,you need a
professional,a sex therapist.

143
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,130
You're right,I do.

144
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,650
I-I-I
need A...

145
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,120
person to talk to
about all of my issues.

146
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:16,120
By sex therapist I mean someone
who will fuck you so good

147
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:19,720
you don't care what your
husband does or doesn't do.

148
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:24,930
You mean like-- like-- like
a professional professional?

149
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,080
Why not?You deserve it.

150
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,840
And it's what you need.

151
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:33,500
You are a smart,wealthy,beautiful woman.

152
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,950
Don't you have a right
to feel desirable?

153
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:40,830
Lenore,I am a fairly
conservative person.

154
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,390
I have boundaries and

155
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,840
you'd be surprised at what you
could do to avoid another divorce.

156
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,420
I'm sure it's not cancerous.

157
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,990
But my husband really thought
I should get it looked at.

158
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,300
Well,that's my job.

159
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,930
You look great,by the way.

160
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,990
So do you.

161
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,970
I mean,I don't know what you're doing,

162
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,760
but whatever it is,you look exactly
the same way you did in high school.

163
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,800
No.

164
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,140
I heard you do botox for helen massey.

165
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,450
Helen's a doll.

166
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,170
Do you think I need it?

167
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,670
No.No.

168
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,790
I think you're perfect.

169
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,990
I wouldn't change a thing.

170
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:26,020
Isn't it funny how both
of us became doctors?

171
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,860
Back in high school we had no
idea where our lives were going

172
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,940
and now look,I do skin,you do feet.

173
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,940
Yeah.

174
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,840
and if you ever need a good
podiatrist,I'm your gal.

175
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,960
That's for sure.

176
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:45,110
Well,let's take a look at this mole
that's got your husband so concerned.

177
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,420
GreaT.

178
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,240
Um,it's in a really bizarre place.

179
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,060
Okay.

180
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,260
It's right there.

181
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,570
Are you on facebook?

182
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,480
Facebook?

183
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,940
If you are,I'll friend you.

184
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,720
rhonda.

185
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,060
Uh,so what's the deal?

186
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,530
Mike's paranoid he's
on some kind of list.

187
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,460
There is no list.

188
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,590
Right,rhonda?

189
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,770
- Rhonda?
- Ray.

190
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,380
This whole district is bankrupt.

191
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,790
The whole city is bankrupt.

192
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,640
Don't you watch tv?

193
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,000
But look here,rhonda,we need mike.

194
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,510
This is not about mike.

195
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:44,740
70% of the teachers in this
school are about to get laid off.

196
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,940
What?That's crazy.

197
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,080
You'll get to reapply for
your jobs next semester.

198
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:53,480
And if you get rehired you'll keep
your former salary but not the benefits.

199
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,810
They're gonna announce it
officially in a couple of weeks.

200
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,980
What do you mean,"you"?

201
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,890
You mean me?

202
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,060
I got tenure.

203
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,590
So does mike.

204
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:19,220
Could things really
fall apart even more?

205
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,410
- hey,dad.
- Yeah?

206
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,400
Are you gonna get fired?

207
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,530
Fired?

208
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,400
No.

209
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,850
I might get laid off.

210
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,580
It's temporary.

211
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,080
It's a maybe.

212
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,460
What are you gonna do?

213
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,820
What if it happens?

214
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,840
Hey,don't worry about
your old man,damester.

215
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,430
Takes a lot to knock me down.

216
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,660
But how are you gonna live?

217
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,240
I could do a lot of things,kid.

218
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,960
In fact,I'm looking
into a lead right now.

219
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,340
I just have to put it in motion.

220
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,350
I'll be right back.

221
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,460
You guys want some milk duds?

222
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,770
get him off!Get him off!

223
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,620
Dude.

224
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,740
It was on the cheek.

225
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,150
Okay,but...

226
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,560
you know.

227
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,520
Somebody help me!

228
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,900
You know,this is fucking pathetic,damon.

229
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,940
What is?

230
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,390
You're not into me.

231
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:51,360
Come on,we're in public.

232
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,970
You never want to mess
around,even when we're alone.

233
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,910
Well,I'm just not ready,okay?

234
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,060
I feel like I'm being used,and
I don't even know what for.

235
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,170
Look...

236
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,770
I understand if...

237
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,390
I understand if you need to break up.

238
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,540
Do what you've got to do.

239
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,870
It won't hurt my feelings.

240
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,720
you're fucking with
my head,straight boy.

241
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,830
Damon,what happened?

242
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,330
Can I talk to you for a minute?

243
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,690
Is that okay,hammer?

244
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,730
Tanya.

245
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,220
Hi,ray.

246
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:37,950
You know,I have to tell you the
flies are on their way out,I think.

247
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,200
I'm so relieved.

248
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,570
I don't like to kill anything.

249
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,390
That's great,tanya.

250
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,310
Can I talk to you about something?

251
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,250
Sure,what's up?

252
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,410
Well...

253
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,620
it's about happiness consultants.

254
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,700
Yeah,what's--
what's wrong?

255
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:01,220
um,never mind.

256
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,230
Just forget it.

257
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,810
Why did powell leave?

258
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,820
I have no idea.

259
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,390
He just ran out on me.

260
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,480
Damon,that's horrible.

261
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,480
Will you hug me?

262
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,320
I love you.

263
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,160
So,did you tell her?

264
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,490
No.

265
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,770
I tried.

266
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,810
But,uh...

267
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,020
look,lenore.

268
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:38,360
Last time I checked capitalism
was about supply and demand.

269
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:42,870
Now I've got the supply
and I've got a demand.

270
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,150
We're gonna do this my way.

271
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,540
Take it or leave it.

272
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,720
NO DOGS ALLOWED IN
PARK-PROTECT OUR CHILDREN

273
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,680
Are you gonna  did you bring a baggie?

274
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:56,660
Excuse me?

275
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,630
Did you bring along a
baggie or a newspaper?

276
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,680
The children the children who play here

277
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:04,040
this is the dog area.

278
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,060
If it'll make you feel better,

279
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:10,550
why don't you find something in the
trash can and scoop the shit up yourself?

280
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,280
Okay,I don't care that much.

281
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,260
Lenore,you said you had news for me.

282
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,580
I couldn't understand your message.

283
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,020
Why are we out here in the pouring rain?

284
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:25,230
Well,you might see this as bad
news,but really it's good news.

285
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,520
Why would I see it as bad news?

286
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,240
I just have a feeling
that no matter what I say

287
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,140
you're gonna look at
it on the sad sack side.

288
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,210
I am not a sad sack.

289
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,120
Will you stop insulting me?

290
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,050
I have better things
to do with my morning.

291
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,260
Stop,listen.

292
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,660
I had lunch with ray and

293
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:42,460
he decided that happiness consultants
should be run by the three of us.

294
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,530
At first I thought it
was a horrible idea.

295
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,130
But then I came around to it.

296
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,670
Except I really don't like
the name happiness consultants.

297
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,850
- We should change it.
- What?

298
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,380
Yeah,he wanted to tell you himself,but
I thought I'd beat him to the punch.

299
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,900
No.

300
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,750
Wait,ray told you that I would
give you half my business?

301
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,580
Honestly,this is a
great deal for you,tanya.

302
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,370
Absolutely not.

303
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,560
Be reasonable,t-brain.

304
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:11,240
Ray needs more savvy than your
management team can provide.

305
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,750
We all bring strengths to the table.

306
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,220
For example,I bring a business head.

307
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,630
You,tanya,bring a
strong sense of ethics.

308
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,300
And ray brings a big dick.

309
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,620
We can be like the three musketeers.

310
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:25,060
Lenore,ray is my prostitute!

311
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:28,400
It is not my fault you
can't keep your ho in line.

312
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,460
Go ask him if you don't believe me.

313
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:33,500
Look,tanya,it's never gonna
work out for you and ray alone.

314
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:36,540
The loser girl never gets the
football player in the end.

315
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,850
It only happens in the movies.

316
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,120
I don't understand what you're saying.

317
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:42,470
I don't understand the words
falling out of your mouth.

318
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,040
Well,then read my lips:
Share ray or no ray.

319
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:47,940
Got it?

320
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,160
Which do you want?

321
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,190
fuck you!

322
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:01,090
I wanted the house,but I had a tent.

323
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,050
I wanted to stay
married,but my wife ran off.

324
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:08,850
I wanted to play
ball,but I taught history.

325
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:14,550
I wanted to teach,but
I was gonna lose my job.

326
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:14,990
Shit!

327
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,430
I wanted electricity,and I got honey.

328
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,000
Ding-dong.

329
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,600
Hi.

330
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,500
What are you cursing for?

331
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,320
If you haven't noticed,mrs.Koontz,

332
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,370
things don't go easy for me.

333
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,160
Depends on what you
mean by things,you know?

334
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,190
Some things go easy for you.

335
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,920
Like what?

336
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,780
Well,you've got me as
a next-door neighbor.

337
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,740
I'd heard you found honey in your
house and I was wondering,could you...

338
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,750
fill up my honey jar?

339
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,770
- Fill up your honey jar?
- Yeah.

340
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,990
I want to make a carrot cake.

341
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,880
I got a lot of work here.

342
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,220
You know,ray,sometimes in life

343
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:09,810
it's best to forget the big problems
and just fuck for a little while.

344
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,450
Have mercy on me,baby

345
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:27,210
I'm down upon my knees

346
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,260
have mercy on me,baby

347
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,890
I'll do just as you please...

348
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,320
Oh shit.

349
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,510
Oh shit,ray.

350
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,000
Oh shit,ray!

351
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:47,390
oh shit,ray!

352
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,400
Ray?

353
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,030
- oh my god.
- Oh god!

354
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,050
who's client is this?

355
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,680
I should have known.

356
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,130
Hey.Hey!

357
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,580
What are you barging into my house for?

358
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,850
Did she come from lenore?

359
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,540
Are you already working with lenore?

360
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,200
What?

361
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,230
That's my next-door neighbor.

362
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,090
My god,you're screwing
your next-door neighbor?

363
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,140
- Shh.
- That's really mature.

364
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,860
Will you back off,tanya?

365
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:22,670
I am gonna have sex for
fun from time to time.

366
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,660
Fuck you,ray!

367
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:24,370
Fuck you!

368
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,670
God damn it!

369
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,150
god damn it!

370
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:33,270
What am I to you?

371
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,590
You don't even know what
it means to be a friend.

372
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,770
you hungry?

373
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,740
I thought you didn't like
corporate chain restaurants.

374
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,230
This one is family owned.

375
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,290
So now you love sausages and hot dogs?

376
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,910
It's comfort food,ray.

377
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,070
I don't know if you could tell,but
I could use a little comfort.

378
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,470
Yeah,I see.

379
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,190
Men suck sometimes.

380
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:27,840
A lot of times,frankly.

381
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:30,150
Will you pass the mustard,please?

382
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,780
Fuck.

383
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,560
I'm gonna get laid off.

384
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,140
Oh my god.I'm sorry.

385
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,910
I'll manage.

386
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,860
Look,ray,come on.

387
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,460
Let's just focus,all right?

388
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,350
Let's just focus.

389
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,780
We'll work twice as
hard,every day,all night.

390
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,650
We can put our minds to it.

391
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,970
We've got the gumption.

392
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,940
We're unbreakable.

393
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,770
Come on,ray.We can rule the world.

394
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,910
Tanya...

395
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:18,180
you've got a good soul.

396
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,510
But I need a professional onboard.

397
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,370
It'll be okay.

398
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,530
Kind of like a threesome.

399
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,150
Kind of like a threesome,huh?

400
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,210
You ever been in a threesome?

401
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,110
Every one I've ever been in,

402
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,230
the other two people screw while
all I do is bring them water.

403
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,590
lenore is a bottom feeder,ray.

404
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,800
She can't understand
happiness consultants.

405
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:45,600
She's the most unhappy person I know.

406
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,740
Oh god.

407
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,260
Don't you want to bring
happiness into the world?

408
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,880
At least on some level?

409
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,690
Sure,tanya.

410
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,290
But right now,I'll settle for a living.

411
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:13,080
So there I was in a fancy
hotel bar wearing a suit

412
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,780
I hated even more than the last one.

413
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,210
Did I make the right call?

414
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,610
What would ernie banks have done?

415
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,650
Welcome to the majors,ray.

416
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:28,950
Okay,this one is a natural blonde
with a great body and a lousy life.

417
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,370
She hasn't had a good lay in ages.

418
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,420
She's a little nervous,but
I think it's gonna be okay.

419
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,950
Just do your thing.

420
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,320
She's gonna meet you upstairs
in half an hour in room 435.

421
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,500
You look good.

422
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:08,540
There are moments in your life
when you realize god is joking.

423
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:14,560
He's up there  hell,maybe she's
up there  laughing her head off.

424
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,950
Either way you're fucked.

425
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:34,470
- hello?
- Hey,jess.It's me,ray.

426
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:37,060
I-is everything okay?

427
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,390
Everything's fine,yeah.

428
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,610
Is there something wrong with the kids?

429
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,770
Kids are fine.

430
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:44,280
I just-- I'm
calling to say hi.

431
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,870
Just wanted to see how you're doing.

432
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,380
How you doing,jess?

433
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,800
I'm fine,ray.

434
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,470
I'm a little busy.

435
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,490
I'm with my mother.We're at the mall.

436
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,500
At the mall,huh?

437
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,060
Yeah.

438
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:08,900
I mean,what do you want,ray?

439
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,830
Nothing.

440
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:15,360
I mean,if this is about the
kids moving back in with you,

441
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,410
this really isn't the time.

442
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,390
I'm not calling about the kids,jess.

443
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,280
Actually...

444
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,960
I think you're a pretty good mom.

445
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,880
Okay?

446
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,650
Don't use reverse psychology on me.

447
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,110
I know you want them back.

448
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,850
No,stop it,jess.

449
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,350
Please,just drop it.

450
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,390
I think you're a good mom.

451
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:46,010
And I...

452
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:49,050
I think I'm a pretty good dad too.

453
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,100
Why are you saying all this,ray?

454
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,800
I don't know.

455
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:05,150
Sometimes it's good to
tell people the truth.

456
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,210
You know?

457
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:11,240
Someone you've known for a long time.

458
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,050
Okay.

459
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,370
Jess?

460
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,440
You there?

461
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,690
I'm here.

462
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,230
Well,thanks for picking up the phone.

463
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,000
It wasn't always the case,you know?

464
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,890
No.

465
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,880
No.

466
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:12,360
Ray,I've got to go.

467
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:17,130
My-- my mother is waving
for me to join her.

468
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:28,280
Well,you-- you tell
your mom that I said hi.

469
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,790
I will.

470
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,750
I used to have a family.

471
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:22,780
I used to have a
wife,kids,a house,a job.

472
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,380
Now,well...

473
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,310
now I had my dick--
a dick and a dream.

474
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,770
If that's not the american way,

475
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,650
what is?

476
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,400
WOMEN WHO RUN WITH THE WOLVES
