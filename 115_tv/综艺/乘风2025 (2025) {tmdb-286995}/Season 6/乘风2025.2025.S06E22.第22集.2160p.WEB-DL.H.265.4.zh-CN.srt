00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:50,516
That was a nice shot!

14
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:52,850
Thanks.
I thought so, too.

15
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:55,854
Come on,
let's see what we got.

16
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:58,056
Huh. Looks like you
shot the shit out of it.

17
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,491
There's nothin' left.

18
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:02,427
Hey.
Lookie here.

19
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:05,664
Jesus. You ever seen
animal tracks that big?

20
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:08,666
No, I have not, Jimbo.

21
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:12,204
Looks like a bear.
A huge one!

22
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:14,339
Come on,
the tracks go this way.

23
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:18,877
Look at that.
Looks like bear droppings.

24
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,680
But with a man poop
right next to it.

25
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:23,782
I'm scared.

26
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:28,253
What the hell are we
dealing with, Ned?

27
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,889
Whatever it is,
it was here recently.

28
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:32,157
Hey!

29
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,026
What the hell are you guys
doing on my farm?

30
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,529
We're trackin' a bear,
Randy.

31
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:38,463
A bear?

32
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,535
That didn't sound
like no bear.

33
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:45,336
Where you goin', Ned?

34
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:48,740
I'm getting
my white ass outta here.

35
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:54,546
What the fuck?!

36
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:55,847
Jesus Christ!

37
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,217
Ahghgghghgh!

38
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:03,221
Helllllllp meeeeee!

39
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:10,829
Neddddddd!

40
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:16,601
All right, we have some dead
cows down at Milner's Ranch.

41
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,204
I want Conners and Tiggs
to check that out.

42
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:21,006
And the two hikers
are still missing.

43
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,341
Let's have all units keep
their ears to the ground.

44
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,811
All right, ladies, that's it.
Second shift starts now.

45
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:28,213
As for me,
I'm finally heading home.

46
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:30,248
Gonna finally get
some R&R, sir?

47
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,585
Yup. Gonna go home and play me
some "Red Dead Redemption 2."

48
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:35,654
I got a train to rob
in Valentine.

49
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:36,922
Detective?!

50
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:38,457
Got a call
from the school.

51
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:39,925
Another kid's
been killed.

52
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:42,360
No, no, not another
school shooting.

53
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:43,895
Can't they handle it
themselves?

54
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:45,631
Said they need us
right away.

55
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:47,466
God damn it.

56
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:50,902
Why the hell can't these kids
stop being a pain in my ass?

57
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,309
Children, everyone
just stay back, okay?

58
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,745
The police are coming.

59
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:02,380
All right, what happened?
What grade was the shooter in?

60
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:03,582
Oh, thank God.

61
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:05,016
Some kindergartners
found the body.

62
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,651
I-I don't think
it was a shooting.

63
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:07,986
Of course
it's a school shooting.

64
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:09,321
It's cut and dry.

65
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:11,055
Let's just get this over with
so I can go home.

66
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:12,124
Where's the victim?

67
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:13,124
Over there.

68
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,328
What the hell?

69
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,430
Jesus,
it's a complete mauling.

70
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:22,701
Looks like part of him
was eaten.

71
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,236
All right, which one of you
little shitheads did this?

72
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:29,073
Come on! I don't have time
for these little games.

73
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:31,043
Which one of you peckers
felt isolated

74
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:32,510
and lashed out
at society?

75
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:35,146
If I have to stay here
and do an investigation

76
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,048
instead of go home
and rob a train,

77
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,484
there's gonna be
serious hell to pay!

78
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:43,088
So, what was he doing
alone on the playground?

79
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,089
Staci Nakabe says
he just wanted to run back out

80
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:45,990
and get his football.

81
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:47,658
Mrph rmhmhm rm!

82
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,328
And there were bear prints
in the snow?

83
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,697
It wasn't a bear.

84
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:53,931
I saw it.

85
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,900
You saw what?

86
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,669
It was at my house.

87
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:59,504
There was a...thing.

88
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:01,906
It attacked my uncle
and took his friend.

89
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:07,412
It was like a bear,
but a pig...thing.

90
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,914
Jesus.

91
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,949
It was at<i> my</i> house
and then here at the school!

92
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,518
Everyone says
that kid and I look alike.

93
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,820
What if that thing
is after<i> me?</i>

94
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:16,654
Dude, now you're just
overreacting.

95
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:17,655
<i>Attention, please.</i>

96
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:18,890
<i>Will the following students</i>

97
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:20,358
<i>report to</i>
<i>the principal's office.</i>

98
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,760
<i>Eric Cartman.</i>
<i>Kenny McCormick.</i>

99
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,062
<i>Thank you, mkay.</i>

100
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:26,665
Aw, what did I do
<i>this</i> time?

101
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:30,936
You go first, Kenny.

102
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,170
Mrph rmhmhm rm!

103
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:33,538
I didn't even
do anything wrong!

104
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,773
Mrph rmhmhm rm!

105
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,475
Just stop being a baby, Kenny,
and go.

106
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:41,013
Take a seat boys.
Right there.

107
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,156
You know how shitty it is
to be a cop?

108
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:53,625
There's real emergencies
every day --

109
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,794
real people
who need real help --

110
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,995
but then, every other minute,
I gotta stop everything

111
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:59,430
'cause one of you
little fuckwads

112
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,232
decides to go
and shoot up the school.

113
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,735
Mrph rmhmhm rm!

114
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:07,705
Shut up! Now, which one of you
had a beef with Colin Brooks?

115
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,607
Nobody gives a shit
about Colin Brooks.

116
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:12,210
Oh, yeah? I asked
the kids in this school,

117
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:13,845
"Who are the biggest loners?

118
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:16,381
Who's most likely to rage
and be the next school shooter?"

119
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:17,949
You know what they said?

120
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,718
The fat, ugly, mean kid and
the detached, loner, poor kid.

121
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,254
Hey, I'm not poor,
all right?

122
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:25,023
Or was it both of you?
Fess up.

123
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,791
I have people
in Horseshoe Overlook

124
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,860
who are depending on me
to get provisions

125
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:30,228
so we can head
back east.

126
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,564
You're playing
"Red Dead Redemption," too?

127
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:33,998
That's right.

128
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,301
And I'm gonna make
both of you school shooters pay

129
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:37,869
for wasting my time.

130
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:42,807
Keep looking.
There's a lot of people

131
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:43,808
saying they saw it,
Kyle.

132
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,043
It's not just me.

133
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:47,078
"Evidence of the creature
of South Park."

134
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,880
This is like
a conspiracy website.

135
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:50,514
It's not a conspiracy,
it's real.

136
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,084
Keep going down.
There's video.

137
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:54,719
There!
Right there!

138
00:05:58,425 --> 00:05:59,691
That's it.

139
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,893
That's was I saw.

140
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,095
I saw ManBearPig.

141
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,563
ManBearPig?

142
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,099
Don't you remember, dude?
We were warned about this.

143
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,868
That weirdo guy who came
and told us this would happen?

144
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,870
He was right.

145
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:13,971
You guys!
You guys!

146
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,373
The police
are trying to say

147
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,042
me and Kenny killed
that douchebag Colin Brooks!

148
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:18,109
What?

149
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,678
They questioned us
for hours.

150
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,480
They said they have enough
to get warrants for our arrest.

151
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:23,147
But it wasn't
you guys.

152
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,850
We know that!
What the hell are we gonna do?!

153
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,151
Who was
that ex-president guy?

154
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,453
The one
who showed up

155
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:30,187
and tried to convince everyone
of a ManBearPig?

156
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,756
Mrph rmhmhm rm?

157
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:34,993
Al Gore.

158
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:38,163
In my report, you'll see that
Eric Cartman and Kenny McCormick

159
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:40,198
are believed to have
worked together.

160
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,966
I've issued warrants
for their arrests,

161
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:45,070
and this case is now
in the hands of the DA.

162
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,304
And I am finally going home.

163
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:49,541
Keep McCormick and Cartman
in separate holding cells,

164
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:51,342
and don't wait on me
to book 'em.

165
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:54,679
I'm gonna be playing
"Red Dead Redemption"
for the next 18 hours.

166
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:55,847
Detective!

167
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:56,815
Whattt?!

168
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,149
There's more dead kids.

169
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,184
Out in the woods
by Stark's Pond.

170
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,153
In the woods?

171
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,322
There was a school shooting
out in the woods?

172
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:06,024
Outside of school
is the one place

173
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:07,559
kids are supposed
to be safe.

174
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,361
They're saying
it's really bad, sir.

175
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:10,461
Need all unites.

176
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,630
God damn it.

177
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,332
If these kids don't stop
killing each other,

178
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:16,367
I'm gonna shoot them all
myself.

179
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:28,879
Hello, uh, we're looking
for a government sort
of guy named Al Gore?

180
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:31,416
Al Gore...?
Al Gore...?

181
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,084
Sounds familiar.

182
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:35,286
He said he was
almost president once.

183
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,821
He came to our town
to warn us about something,

184
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,022
and we have
to find him.

185
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,425
Oh, yeah.

186
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:43,027
This looks
like Jim Turner.

187
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,395
Mrph rmhmhm?

188
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,597
The state bowling champion
five years in a row.

189
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:47,966
You can always
catch him practicing

190
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,601
down at Gramercy Lanes.

191
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:56,874
Focus.

192
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,811
Calm.
Center.

193
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:07,151
Yes!
Die!

194
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,653
Die, you pins!

195
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,922
Oh, we've got a straggler,
do we?

196
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:13,592
You're gonna die
just like the rest of 'em.

197
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:14,592
Mr. Gore?

198
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,961
Focus.
Calm.

199
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,329
Al Gore?

200
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:25,570
That's a name I haven't heard
in a long time.

201
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:27,071
I don't know
if you remember us,

202
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,708
but we're the kids you got to
help try and capture ManBearPig?

203
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,777
Well, uh
you were right.

204
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,612
Ha. You -- You were
totally right.

205
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:35,914
ManBearPig is real,

206
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,115
and, uh, he's killing
lots of people in our town.

207
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:41,386
Oh.
Sucks for you.

208
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:46,190
Please, Mr. Gore!
We need your help!

209
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,958
ManBearPig
isn't going to stop.

210
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,461
Oh, is it
<i>inconvenient</i> now?

211
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:53,631
I tried to warn you all,
but no one took me cereal.

212
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,634
You all just made fun of me,
didn't you?

213
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:58,269
Well, now you can just
deal with it yourselves.

214
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:01,439
Please, just tell us --
How do you stop it?

215
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:03,541
You stop it
all those years ago

216
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,611
when I freaking warned you
and you still had time!

217
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:08,279
There has to be something
we can still do.

218
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,680
Please, Mr. Gore.
You're the only person

219
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,115
who knows
anything about it.

220
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:14,852
Say you're sorry
for making fun of me.

221
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,053
We didn't...

222
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,722
We didn't realize
there were more than --

223
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,992
Say you're sorry
for making fun of me.

224
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,729
We're sorry
for making fun of you.

225
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:28,466
<i>That</i> didn't sound
cereal at all.

226
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,875
You can't just go along

227
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:39,343
with what people are saying,
Susan, okay?

228
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,145
There's no
scientific proof,

229
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,848
no real evidence
of a ManBearPig.

230
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,051
Well, there's a lot
of smart people saying
ManBearPig is real.

231
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:50,421
Yeah, and a lot of smarter
people saying it isn't, okay?

232
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,123
What you need to understand,
Susan,

233
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,793
is that everyone has an agenda.
Okay?

234
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:57,394
Everyone wants to use
the fear of a ManBearPig

235
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:58,663
to get what they want.

236
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,566
So they throw around
bad science, bad taxidermy.

237
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,269
People coming
out of the woodwork

238
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,137
are now experts
on the subject.

239
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:10,374
But you have to use
your own brain, sweetheart.

240
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:11,843
You can't just
let people tell you

241
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:13,344
that if you don't believe
in ManBearPig,

242
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,046
then you don't care
about the world.

243
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:16,614
It is real!

244
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,751
You wanna believe it's real,
you go right on ahead, Susan.

245
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:22,520
No, it's right there!
It's right there behind you!

246
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:30,328
Okay,
ManBearPig<i> is</i> real.

247
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,163
What are we gonna do
about it now, huh?

248
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:33,431
What are we gonna do

249
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,300
that's gonna make
any difference now, Susan?

250
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,335
What?!
We have to do something!

251
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:40,204
What can<i> we</i> do that everyone
else will also do, Susan?

252
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:41,873
Come on, use your brain.

253
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,407
Even if we do
something about it...

254
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:44,775
...what about the Chinese?

255
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:47,244
They're just gonna keep
right on -- Ahghhggh!

256
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:49,714
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪

257
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,449
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪

258
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,918
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪

259
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,653
♪ That should've
been president ♪

260
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,990
Oh, thanks guys!
You shouldn't have!

261
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,925
You told us to.

262
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:03,161
What did you guys
get me?

263
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,929
Oh, wow.
Look!

264
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:06,697
It's a "You were right
about ManBearPig"

265
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,199
signed picture!

266
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:09,868
So, um...

267
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,936
now maybe we can all
work together, huh?

268
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:14,873
Hang on!
It's movie time!

269
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,640
Go, go!
Start it up.

270
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,811
This is the best party ever.

271
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:21,846
Oh, look, guys.
It's me!

272
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:25,116
There I am,
campaigning to be president!

273
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:27,051
That's me
with Hillary!

274
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,987
There's more of me
on the campaign trail,

275
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:30,788
so full of dreams!

276
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,924
Oh, look! It's me when I found
out I lost the election!

277
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,560
Boo!

278
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:36,694
But then look!

279
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,863
There's me getting
an Academy Award!

280
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,199
Okay, can we stop
ManBearPig now?!

281
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,768
Who said anything
about stopping M.B.P.?

282
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,236
Y-You told us
to do all this.

283
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:48,806
Yeah, to make up
for ripping on me!

284
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,642
You're still not even
gonna help us?!

285
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:53,244
I've moved on
from this life, okay?!

286
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:54,912
I have a<i> new</i> life now!

287
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:56,214
I'm a bowler!

288
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,882
And when I'm not bowling,
I help out my gang.

289
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,685
They're my family now!

290
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:02,319
We're wanted in Blackwater,

291
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:05,123
and we have to move
our camp soon!

292
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,891
You're playing
Red Dead Redemption 2?

293
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,559
Yeah. It's amazing.

294
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,328
Only thing is,
I have all these stolen items,

295
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,996
and I don't know
how to sell them.

296
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:14,132
We know how.

297
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:15,600
Oh, really?

298
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:22,073
No witnesses to the attack
were left alive.

299
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,741
The same bear and pig droppings
were found

300
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,676
along with
human excrement.

301
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:27,078
I don't believe it.

302
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,280
A school shooting
at an ice cream shop.

303
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:30,981
Damn it!
When children leave school,

304
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:33,250
they're supposed to be
out of harm's way.

305
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,385
Detective!

306
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,186
Sir, we got word
on the two suspects.

307
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:37,922
They appear to be
on the run.

308
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,990
I would be, too,
if I were guilty.

309
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:42,293
No one has seen them
or their two closest friends.

310
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:44,729
A Marsh
and Broflovski.

311
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:47,231
So, we got us a gang
of shooters, huh?!

312
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:51,269
How the hell hard can it be
to find four boys?!

313
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,336
Sir...

314
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,104
Why don't you take
a break, sir?

315
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,172
Ehh.

316
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:56,474
You've been
hittin' it hard.

317
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,476
We'll do all we can
to catch these kids.

318
00:12:58,478 --> 00:12:59,577
Go home,

319
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,345
play some
"Red Dead Redemption."

320
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:02,546
Huh.

321
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,314
Got to admit,
I'd love to see the sun

322
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,517
rise over
Citadel Rock again.

323
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,552
And I got me a gal
who claims she's got

324
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,187
a side mission or two.

325
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,389
Go on home, sir.

326
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:14,792
We'll take care
of everything here.

327
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,099
This is it.

328
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:23,301
Every piece of information
I ever gathered

329
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,568
on ManBearPig.

330
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,537
Where did ManBearPig
come from?

331
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,173
Is it some sort
of genetic mutation?

332
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:30,741
Oh!
I thought that once, too.

333
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,277
I wanted to find
ManBearPig's origins.

334
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,614
And so I created this --
the Internet.

335
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:39,016
With that, I was able
to search everywhere

336
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,517
for any bit of data.

337
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,521
And what I learned is
that ManBearPig...

338
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,423
is a demon.

339
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:46,690
Rmphm?!

340
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,826
This is
"The Temptation of St. Anthony"

341
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,428
by Martin Schongauer.

342
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,163
It depicts several demons --

343
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:56,434
WolfMonkeyGuy, ChickenFishWoman
and ElephantPorcupineMan,

344
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:57,835
just to name a few.

345
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,304
All of them demons sent
by the Devil himself.

346
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,773
Oh, my God.

347
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,041
What?

348
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,543
I should play "Red Dead"
on<i> this</i> computer,

349
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:06,644
with all three screens.

350
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,680
That'd be
so bitchin' sweet.

351
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,814
Why did the devil
send ManBearPig?!

352
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,283
Why does the devil
do anything?

353
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:13,985
He's the freakin' devil.
He's a dick.

354
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:17,154
It's probably too late.

355
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:19,390
By now ManBearPig
is so powerful

356
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:20,925
that the only way
to get rid of him

357
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,728
is to send him
back to hell.

358
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:28,299
We're going to have
to do a demonic ritual.

359
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:29,600
All I can say is,

360
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,735
you boys better get
to the grocery store,

361
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:35,907
'cause it's time...
to get cereal.

362
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,080
Harrison Yates,
where have ya been?!

363
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,382
Another school shooting,
Maggie.

364
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,185
Down at
Baskin-Robbins.

365
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:52,623
I haven't seen you in days.
I've missed you so much.

366
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,425
Come have some supper
with me.

367
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:56,761
Maggie, I just need to relax
a bit, all right?

368
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:57,928
Please.

369
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,530
I've been waiting for this
a long time.

370
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:00,931
Just give me a --

371
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,733
Wait a minute.

372
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,102
The house in Valentine
is built?

373
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,505
Where did I get
a sniper rifle?

374
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:08,572
Maggie!

375
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,408
Did you play over
my save game?

376
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,942
I just played
a little bit.

377
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:14,244
A little bit, you --
On my save game?!

378
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,214
Why didn't you
start your own?!

379
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:17,582
You're never home
anymore!

380
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,149
With all these
school shootin's!

381
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:21,219
I need a life,
too, ya know!

382
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:23,121
So I robbed a lumber mill
in Monto's Rest,

383
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:25,189
upgraded my horse,
and got a sniper rifle.

384
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:27,091
That's<i> my</i> life,
Maggie!

385
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,626
I was going for
more honor points!

386
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:29,861
God damn it!

387
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:31,829
Why can't we have
a life together?!

388
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:33,764
I haven't gotten to play
in three days.

389
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,399
You've done all this
stuff without me!

390
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:36,968
You got deputized?!

391
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,137
Oh, God damn it!
That does it.

392
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,139
Where are ya goin'?!

393
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:43,107
I'm starting
a new life!

394
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,675
I'm creating
a new save game.

395
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:46,243
You can't possibly go
all the way back

396
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:47,478
to the snow level
again!

397
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,480
What choice
do I have now?!

398
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:55,053
Fuckin' bitch.

399
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:09,467
Abbul abash my-ah.

400
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,869
What Satan has
put forth upon this earth

401
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:15,540
may it be summoned
and banished forever.

402
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,176
Dude, come on,
what are we doing?

403
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:20,745
This is stupid.
He was right before.

404
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:23,947
We call upon
the powers of darkness.

405
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:26,884
Come on, guys.
We call upon...

406
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:30,254
We call upon
the powers of darkness.

407
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:32,356
Al Gore was right.

408
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,926
Al Gore was right
all along.

409
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:37,728
Al Gore was right
all along.

410
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,831
We should have
listened to Al Gore.

411
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,901
We should have
all listened to Al Gor--
Wait.

412
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:45,436
Wait.
Are you videoing us?

413
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:47,404
It's Instagram live.
Keep going!

414
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:50,441
We should have taken Al Gore
more cereal.

415
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:52,043
All right. All right.
That's enough.

416
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:53,844
You need to stop wasting
our time, dude.

417
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,179
People are dying!

418
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,680
You don't have a fucking clue
what you're doing!

419
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,293
You were saying?

420
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:10,428
Aw, shit!

421
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,529
God Damn it!
Nothing!

422
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,464
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

423
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:30,448
Do you all have any idea
what's it's like to start over?!

424
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,416
You walk four hours
through the snow

425
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,385
relearning everything,

426
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,420
all because your bitch wife
went and spent

427
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:39,656
all your hard earned money
on upgrades you didn't want!

428
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:41,558
I get one little break
from work --

429
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,128
one little break --
and I didn't even get back

430
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,430
to the first brawl
at the saloon.

431
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,899
You can actually bypass
that fight

432
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,300
if you go hunting
with Dutch.

433
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:51,636
Shut up!

434
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:54,338
These school shootings are done,
you hear me?!

435
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,907
I want this case closed
by the end of the night,

436
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,409
one way or another!

437
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,243
Now, let's move out!

438
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,646
Here he comes, boys!

439
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,448
Prepare yourselves!

440
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:19,363
Who hath summoned me
to this realm?!

441
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:21,331
Dude!
You summoned Satan!

442
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,802
Yeah no doi!
What'dya think we were doing?!

443
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:29,072
Prince of darkness!
It is I, Al Gore!

444
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:31,708
I was almost
president!

445
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,780
What do you wish of me,
Al Gore?!

446
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:36,947
A demon from Hell

447
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,282
has been unleashed
upon our world!

448
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,586
We demand
to know its nature!

449
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:44,555
We demand to know
its reason for coming!

450
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:49,327
There is only one place you can
find the answers you seek!

451
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:52,129
It is the place
where all knowledge

452
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,398
becomes known!

453
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,401
Your local library.

454
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:59,904
Ah! You are
correct.

455
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:02,940
Your local library
is an excellent resource

456
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:05,042
for whatever
you wish to learn.

457
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:07,244
Yes, it is.

458
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,313
Then I command
thee, Satan,

459
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,782
to come with us
to the local library!

460
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:14,218
And I am cereal!

461
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,386
Dude, Satan's not gonna
go with us to the --

462
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:21,225
Very well, Al Gore.
Let us go!

463
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,430
Yeah, guys!
Guys, over here!

464
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:28,398
I think I found it.

465
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,235
What you're dealing with
is a Sifter of Fate.

466
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:32,636
Mrph rmhmhm?

467
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:35,439
So there's these demons
that, um, actually come

468
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:37,341
once every few
generations.

469
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,576
They're all about
making deals.

470
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:40,744
Making deals?

471
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,146
Yeah, check it out.

472
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:45,048
"The Sifter of Fate thrives
on tempting mankind.

473
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,052
It will always offer a deal
in exchange for mercy,

474
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:50,086
but the carnage will
be a thousand times worse

475
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,555
when the debt comes due."

476
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:52,790
Okay, so wait.

477
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,625
Now you're saying
that someone in our town

478
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:55,959
made a deal
with that thing?

479
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,395
Now it's here to claim
it's part of the bargain.

480
00:19:58,397 --> 00:19:59,930
It's sort of like
when you're part of a gang

481
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,865
feuding with a rival gang,
you know.

482
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,133
You ride around on your horse

483
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,368
thinking it won't all
catch up with you,

484
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,203
but it always does.

485
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,438
You're playing
"Red Dead Redemption," too?

486
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,874
So good, right?

487
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,644
Attention, school shooters!

488
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:16,213
We have you surrounded!

489
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,882
Come out with your hands up!

490
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,251
Oh, Jesus.
You gotta tell them, Mr. Gore!

491
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:22,686
Tell them it
wasn't us!

492
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:25,456
No. They don't
listen to me, kids.

493
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,058
It's up to you
young people now.

494
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,228
You have to find a way to
get people to take this cereal.

495
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,563
You must convince people
there's a ManBearPig,

496
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,933
which Satan told you is
a Fate Sifter demon

497
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:39,103
that made a deal
with someone in this town!

498
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:40,671
That's gonna be
impossible.

499
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:42,940
Yeah, sounds really hard,
doesn't it?

500
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:44,107
People might not believe you

501
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,609
and, like, make fun
of you and stuff.

502
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,077
Poor you guys, huh?

503
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:54,485
They are
coming out!

504
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:56,553
Hands where
we can see em!

505
00:20:56,555 --> 00:21:00,190
Everyone, listen!
ManBearPig is real.

506
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,393
It's a demon that thrives
on making deals

507
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:04,695
to exploit mankind's
weaknesses.

508
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:07,498
I am super-duper cereal.

509
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:14,238
We all have to work together,
you guys. This one time.

510
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,374
We have to all put
our pride aside

511
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:19,810
and be willing to say,
maybe we were wrong.

512
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:22,346
All right, lock these
little fuckers up!

513
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:25,348
No! You can't!

514
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,052
That's it, gentlemen!
Case closed.

515
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:30,420
Now I've got a God damn
stagecoach to rob

516
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:31,955
in Scarlett Meadows!

517
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,623
Well done, sir!

518
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,626
No! Noooo!

519
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:38,629
<i>Please! Somebody made</i>
<i>a deal with ManBearPig!</i>

520
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,398
<i>We have to find out who!</i>

521
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,001
Billy...

522
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:45,870
what have I done?

523
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,175
What are we gonna do

524
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:54,044
that's gonna make
any difference now, Susan?

525
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:56,079
What?!
We have to do something!

526
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:58,949
What can<i> we</i> do that everyone
else will also do, Susan?

527
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:00,618
Come on, use your brain.

528
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,152
Even if we do
something about it...

529
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,520
...what about the Chinese?

530
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:06,731
They're just gonna keep
right on -- Ahghhggh!
