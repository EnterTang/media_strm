1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,240
The worst thing that we could do right
now is to ease up too soon,

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,360
allow a second peak of the virus to
hit the NHS and hit

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,320
the British people.

4
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,640
Good evening.

5
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,800
"There is light at the end of the
tunnel."

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,200
The words of the Foreign Secretary
Dominic Raab,

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,840
deputising for the Prime Minister, as
he announced the expected further

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,000
three week lockdown, at least.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,520
There was encouraging news from the
press conference that

10
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,320
transmission of the virus has been
reduced to less than one to one,

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,400
due to adherence to social distancing
and self-isolating.

12
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,280
But there was no information about
what that light at the end

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,400
of the tunnel might look like - no
detail of what an exit

14
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,600
strategy might entail.

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,760
The Government says it does not want
the public

16
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,680
to receive "mixed messages."

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,320
Raab acknowledged that several other
countries have shared their exit

18
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,720
strategy with the public, but he said
it would be

19
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,400
irresponsible at this stage here in
the UK.

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,760
Later we'll look closely at the exit
strategy in Germany,

21
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,480
and the reasons for it.

22
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,880
And we'll hear from the former Foreign
Secretary David Miliband

23
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,040
on how the world may be reshaped
post-Covid.

24
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,440
But first our Policy Editor Lewis
Goodall examines the Government's

25
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,840
strategy over the lockdown, and their
refusal to discuss options

26
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:37,800
for the way out of it.

27
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:50,000
Day 24 of lockdown giving way to day
25. We have done 45 days of lockdown

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,160
before it is over. It is remarkable
that it no longer seems remarkable.

29
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:01,720
Britain will remain in confinement
until 7th May. Based on this advice,

30
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,480
which we carefully considered, the
Government has decided the current

31
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,800
measures must remain in place for at
least the next three weeks. Dominic

32
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:19,120
Raab announced five tests which must
be met until any relaxation. The

33
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,840
Government is looking for:

34
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,520
But there was encouraging news too,
the Government scientists think the

35
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:40,800
average infection rate is now below
one. R value is important, it is the

36
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:50,800
number of people an infected person
comes to infect. If R value falls

37
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,920
below one, they're infecting less than
one other. If it is more than

38
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:00,240
one it goes up. Other places like
Germany and Norway have focussed on

39
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:06,680
R value. It was when it dipped below 1
that Governments started to talk

40
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,000
about relaxation of lock down. Not
here, because we are not testing

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,400
enough. They can use proxy indicators
to try and understand

42
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:22,440
where we are currently and what the
reproduction number is and looking

43
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,480
at fatality numbers and look at their
sites to understand how it

44
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,800
affects particular communities and how
they're doing. I don't see how

45
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,720
they can say it decisively until they
have the antibodies in the

46
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,040
community. That first mistake of not
getting ahead of testing returns to

47
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:47,200
haunt us. But the other reason Britain
isn't showing more leg on

48
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,840
exit strategy is political. The Prime
Minister is recovering and for

49
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,320
as much as we may here about
collective responsibility it seems

50
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,280
unlikely that ministers will be able
to pull on the big levers until he

51
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:08,160
is back. These weeks about allow time
for the virus to recede and

52
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,920
time for the Prime Minister to get
better. The questions of when and

53
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:19,080
how will continue to grow louder. What
is going on in the economy.

54
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,480
Something over which Tory backbenchers
are mindful. The real

55
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,360
question is we need to ensure that
bounce back happens straight after

56
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,440
coronavirus, because if it is a blip
for three months in the figures,

57
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,560
then that is one thing and that is
something that we obviously can look

58
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,120
at and it will be difficult and add to
the national debt, but that is

59
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,240
something that is manageable. I think
the entire, the real issue

60
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,600
here and which is lie the lockdown is
important and we get it right and

61
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,200
don't end up with that second spike,
so that is why it is important we

62
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:59,080
get it right now is that if we can get
that, we can probably keep on

63
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,640
with the broader agenda that the
Government is pursuing. The economic

64
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:12,400
catastrophe is real. Data showed 5. 2
million Americans have applied for

65
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,640
unemployment. One in six of the
American labour force are out of

66
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:27,640
work. In Britain we have seen 1. 4
million apply for universal credit.

67
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:33,800
The whole goal of the programme is to
not just keep people in work, but

68
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,560
keep companies solvent. If they are
still solvent and the degree of the

69
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,880
lifting of measures allows companies
to get towards normality, we can

70
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,640
hope that all these people who are
furloughed will more or less keep

71
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,200
their jobs. But that is a huge
question mark and we have seen the

72
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,000
numbers, wre know a lot of companies
that were relying on the scheme are

73
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,160
not going to exist when the lockdown
finishes. 45 days to save the NHS

74
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,480
and save lives, but at the cost of
house arrest for the population and

75
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:12,360
life support for the economy. It will
be VE Day before this is

76
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,120
lifted, but victory won't come with a
parade, just people quietly almost

77
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,360
certainly in fear trying to resume
their lives.

78
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,280
Any decision about an exit strategy
will ultimately

79
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,120
be all about the data, and add to that
modelling,

80
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,800
but without widespread testing both
are lacking.

81
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,720
Our Health correspondent Deborah Cohen
reports on another

82
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:39,880
source of information that could
provide some fresh insight.

83
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,040
There are various different data sets
in England that can give us an

84
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,920
indication about what's going on with
the virus.

85
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,320
One of them is from the Royal College
of GPs.

86
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,480
It has over 500 specialist practices
that

87
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,880
monitor what is happening with all
different kinds of respiratory

88
00:06:52,880 --> 00:07:00,840
illnesses all year around.

89
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,920
Public Health England is relying on it
for

90
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,000
information in this pandemic.

91
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,880
When one has signs and symptoms of a
respiratory illness, the health

92
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,000
workers at those centres will swab
them, if there is a test available.

93
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,400
At the moment, there are 26,000 people
attending these practices

94
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,440
being monitored for Covid-19.

95
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,040
However it is worth remembering some
people may not go to see their GP -

96
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,320
either going to NHS 11, or to
hospital.

97
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:27,560
The green line shows people going to
GPs with Covid-19.

98
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,040
Currently, the data is showing for the
past few weeks, there are 5

99
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,240
people per 10,000 with Covid-19.

100
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,200
In the past two weeks, it seems to
have plateaued.

101
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,760
The red and yellow lines also tell an
interesting story.

102
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,160
They're people going with any
respiratory infections to their GPs

103
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,280
and they show a dramatic drop on 16th
March.

104
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,600
The early hand washing effect and the
encouragement of

105
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,480
social distancing has had a dramatic
effect to drop all acute respiratory

106
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:59,200
infections, up and lower those like
pneumonia,

107
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,600
which are the most worst that we are
worried about.

108
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,480
And, prior to 24th March, about half
of all the reductions in

109
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:09,640
infections occurred because of those
measures.

110
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,040
Another data set is the one the
Government releases on

111
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,000
deaths occurring in hospital, which
you can see in this chart.

112
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,960
Now, there are more numbers to come
for

113
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,640
the shaded area, so these could
change.

114
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:26,680
Professor Heneghan suggests that the
peak happened on 8th April.

115
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,800
The hospital death data is becoming
much clearer now that the peak of

116
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,440
deaths in hospitals in England
occurred on 8th April.

117
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,640
And that date's now moved outside the

118
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:43,200
uncertainty zone and it's flatlined
since that point, right up to now.

119
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,040
So we can be much clearer that we have
hit the peak of deaths on 8th

120
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,120
April and then you can track that from
that date,

121
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,920
you go back at least two if not three
weeks and

122
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:58,840
assume that is the point at which the
infection peaked.

123
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,720
Now, we have spoken to Public Health
England

124
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,640
and they say they don't recognise
there being

125
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,440
a peak at that time.

126
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,320
Data are now being released about the
results of tests for the

127
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:13,640
coronavirus in front line workers.

128
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,760
During the outbreak in Italy, around 1
in 10

129
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,680
health workers accounted for
infections in all those

130
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,840
who were tested.

131
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,160
It looks like to me in the data about
a third of all the

132
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,880
infections are now potentially in
health care workers.

133
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,760
That figure has trended up and up and
I suspect, as we

134
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:35,040
test more nursing home workers, more
of the people working in settings

135
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,600
like community hospitals potentially,
but particularly in

136
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,240
hospitals, it is worrying that
actually a high proportion of those

137
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,880
are infected and they have the
potential to keep the infection

138
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:52,520
ongoing, if you like.

139
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,440
One of the European countries which
has embarked

140
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,600
on its exit strategy and has shared
its "workings"

141
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,480
with its population in Germany, and
the way that Angela Merkel has

142
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,640
handled the coronavirus and delivered
the exit strategy has

143
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,040
sent her approval ratings and her
authority, in the doldrums

144
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:09,960
for months, sky high in the opinion
polls.

145
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:16,640
Gabriel Gatehouse is here to tell us
why is Germany so different from us.

146
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,920
Why is that happen something By the
figures, Germany just looks so much

147
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:30,760
better, under 4,000 deaths they have
recorded as opposed to 13,000. That

148
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,240
is in a country with a larger
population and more reported

149
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:40,560
infections. There were numerous
possible reasons, one might be the

150
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,440
structure of the health care system
and scientists believe the initial

151
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:50,760
infection was in a relatively young
and fit population. But that

152
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:57,040
wouldn't account for this huge
difference in the death rate, the

153
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:03,280
case fatality rate, the percentage of
people who die. 13% in the UK. 3%

154
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:10,560
in swraermy. -- Germany. N't One
reason is testing. The Germans have

155
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,920
done a huge amount and they have a
picture of the number who contract

156
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:22,520
the virus, maybe without symptoms, who
go on to die. Scientist there

157
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,880
are urging caution and are saying the
death rate may go up and Angela

158
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,280
Merkel when she announced the partial
lifting of lockdown was

159
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:37,760
cautious. She said partially
re-opening of school, but still

160
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,960
banned gatherings of more than two
people and pubs and bars closed. She

161
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,560
spoke about that R number that Lewis
talked about and the Government

162
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:50,600
talked about. They think it is about
at 1 in Germany now, which mean it

163
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,120
is number of infections shouldn't
rise. But look at the level of

164
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:03,680
detail that Angela Merkel goes into
her. Here she is yesterday.

165
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:02,680
The key phrase was at the end, we have
an infection figure that we can

166
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,760
monitor and track. It goes back to
testing. Germany has a better

167
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,880
picture of what is going on and they
can be more confident in lifting

168
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,920
some restrictions, knowing if they see
the rate go up again they can

169
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:25,080
act in good time. The The UK and
Germany set off in the same dreshgs.

170
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:29,560
Pub -- Direction. Yes they worked
together on one of the first tests

171
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:37,240
and the UK and Germany were doing what
is called community testing and

172
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,440
contact tracing and then quarantining
them and people that

173
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,160
they have been in touch with. Germany
did more of that than we

174
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,400
did. But we were also doing it. Until
there was a policy change.

175
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:54,560
12th March when the Prime Minister
announced we were moving from the

176
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,440
containment phase, IE stopping the
spread to the policy of delay,

177
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,720
delaying the peak to try and take the
pressure off the NHS. This is

178
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,920
when the Prime Minister, the headline
figure he was asking people

179
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,520
with a mild fever to stay at home for
seven days. But potentially the

180
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:15,880
more significant change of policy was
articulated by Chris Whitty who

181
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,920
said on the 12th March that community
testing and contact

182
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:26,400
tracing would stop.

183
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,800
It is no longer needed for us to
identify every case

184
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,920
and we will move from having testing
mainly done in homes and outpatients

185
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,720
and walk-in centres to a situation
where people who are remaining

186
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,840
at home do not need testing and we
will pivot all of the testing

187
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:47,800
capacity to identifying people in
hospitals who have got symptoms.

188
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,680
So, the Germans also pivoted from
containment to delay but they never

189
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,200
stopped community testing and contact
tracing. I spoke to one of

190
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,800
the most senior virologist in Germany
this evening and they said

191
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,200
it was never stopped because they knew
it would be one of their main

192
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,080
tools, not just to contain the spread
but also to give a clear

193
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,960
picture of what is going on thereby
allowing you some way to make

194
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,640
decisions about how you get out of the
lockdown. Chris Whitty

195
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,160
specifically said we will pivot our
testing capacity to the hospital.

196
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:26,040
That was on the 12th of March. We are
still only today at 80,000. It

197
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,640
was presented then as a policy change,
but it almost certainly had

198
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:35,080
as much to do with capacity as policy.
We have basically gone back

199
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:40,120
to a policy of community testing, it
is implicit in the 100,000 figure,

200
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:46,080
but I still think that the actual
reality is lagging behind. Thank you

201
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,480
very much indeed, Gabriel.

202
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,400

Public Health

Tropical Medicine.

204
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,240
And I'm also joined by Justin Madders,

205
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,400
Labour's Shadow Health Minister and
Steve Brine, who was

206
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,160
Conservative Health Minister between
2017 and 2019.

207
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:07,280
Good evening all. I would like to
start with Martin McKay. Do you

208
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:12,800
think that we are getting fixated on
the idea that we are making a false

209
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,400
choice, health versus wealth and what
we are doing is we have stopped

210
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,920
the economy in its tracks and we will
do it until we get the virus

211
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,400
shifted? Absolutely. We have to
remember one simple fact, people who

212
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:30,080
are dead do not contribute to the
economy, they do not go to the shops

213
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:34,360
or restaurants and unless we control
this epidemic, frankly, we will do

214
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,640
much more damage to the economy in the
long run. We have good evidence

215
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:45,600
from the 19 -- 1918 flu epidemic from
the USA when city closed down

216
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,360
and opened up at different stages that
there was a close down earlier

217
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,000
and stayed close for longer recovered
much more rapidly when the

218
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,080
pandemic the past. It is not a false
choice. How long do you think

219
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,960
restrictions can continue before real
damage is done to long-term

220
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,800
health because of things like the lack
of work, depression and so

221
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:13,080
forth, don't you have two operate an
economic model that looks to the

222
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:17,840
future, while you're dealing with with
the virus? Absolutely. We have

223
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:23,680
done a lot of research on the impact
on primarily the global crisis after

224
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,640
2008 but also other periods going back
to the Great Depression and

225
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,880
there are serious health consequences,
particularly when

226
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,040
people face a precarious existence,
Preparatory of employment, income

227
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:41,160
and housing. You talk about a disease
of despair. Exactly. Those

228
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,960
of the diseases which have been
rising, the debts from those causes

229
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,800
in the United Kingdom and the United
didn't state a greater extent from

230
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,000
other industrialised countries over
the last ten years. We also know

231
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,440
that there is a lot you can do to
mitigate the effects of the economic

232
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,160
problems. Take suicides, they are very
good marker of things going

233
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,960
wrong. We were able to show that
during successive financial crisis

234
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,200
and recession is in Europe, that in a
number of countries, southern

235
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,160
European countries primarily, when job
losses went up, suicides went up

236
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,680
as expected and when the economy
recovered, they came down. But in

237
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,120
the Scandinavian countries, there was
no connection at all. Those

238
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,480
countries could face major economic
problems and mitigate many of the

239
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,080
effects and we know a lot more about
what needs to be done for that to

240
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,800
happen. Active Labour market
programmes, helping people back into

241
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,760
work, fundamentally sending out a
message that the government cares

242
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:45,040
about you. You have been helping to
inform the government 's exit

243
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:52,160
strategy, do you think there is plan?
I haven't been helping the

244
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,760
UK,. The World Health Organisation. I
am also on the European

245
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,560
Commission. The European Commission
has published an outline of what

246
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,560
exit plans would look like and that
came out in the last day or two and

247
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,520
that sets out the stages that we need
to go through and it is very

248
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:13,880
clear that we need to be driven by the
epidemiology. The reproduction

249
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,400
number that you are talking about,
that is absolutely fundamental. We

250
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,800
need to get that below one and keeper
below one. That means that as

251
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,880
we open up and loosen the
restrictions, we need to think of

252
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,240
how we do that in a way that keeps it
below one. That may mean that we

253
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,440
do other things, like maintaining
social distancing. I think we will

254
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:41,200
see much more attention to wearing
masks in public, as is happening in

255
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,520
the Czech Republic, Austria, and
elsewhere another things that could

256
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:50,240
be done, you open up a little bit and
then you evaluate, monitor and

257
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,680
check the impact and you move very
quickly. That comes back to the

258
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,000
point you're making earlier, we need
far better data than we have in the

259
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,280
United Kingdom at present. We simply
don't have the information we need.

260
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:09,280
Thank you. Let me turn to the MPs,
Justin, first of all, you think it

261
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:15,040
would help people to understand and
help people 's sense of their own

262
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:20,360
future, the government detailed its
exit strategy, not to activate right

263
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:26,000
now, but to say what is likely to
happen in the near future? Yes, I do

264
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,360
think that would help, because all
along we have been saying that the

265
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,560
government needs to be very open and
transparent about what they are

266
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,880
doing and why. I think at this stage,
if we are being told, this

267
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,400
will carry on three weeks, three
months, whatever, without any real

268
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,000
sense of where it is going to end up
on what it will look like, people

269
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,440
will begin to lose a little bit of
confidence and they need that open

270
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,160
dialogue with government to really
keep going with the current

271
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,240
restrictions and have faith that it
will actually turn in the end. Let

272
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:04,440
me put this to you, Steve, perhaps the
reason, because people are

273
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,680
thinking now on what we are talking
about tonight is the fact of the

274
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,760
data, there is not enough data there,
that actually there has not

275
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:16,440
been enough data for the government
actually to work out a plan? OK, let

276
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:23,080
us look at some data, 861 people lost
their lives in the reporting

277
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,800
period that you are reporting today on
the BBC. If that was a train

278
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,760
crash or an accident that happened in
one day alone, that would be an

279
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,280
enormous story. You don't get to a
game where it is one apiece and you

280
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:40,720
settle for the draw, you go for the
win. To relax now would be dangerous

281
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,160
and would be an quick... I'm not
actually talking about relaxing now,

282
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,920
what I am talking about is having a
plan, a plan that you would then

283
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:55,680
share with people to show confidence
in the public. There is a plan, a

284
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,080
very clear plan that the government
are working to a you heard Dominic

285
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,200
Raab today talk about the five test
and I thought that was incredibly

286
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,200
sensible, they are the yardsticks by
which they will measure where we can

287
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:11,840
move to the next stage. That was
criteria, not a plan. It was not

288
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:17,200
sane as angler Merkel has said how she
is going about it. I understand

289
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,960
this obsession the BBC have with
Germany. Germany is not the same as

290
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,360
the United Kingdom, they are at
different countries with different

291
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:32,080
systems and I suspect there are two
answers to the planned question of

292
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,000
that Keir Starmer who has to try and
stay in the story somehow. I suspect

293
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
there is an elegant answer which is
that they will be led by the science

294
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,360
and that three weeks is a long way
away right now and I suspect there

295
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,040
is an inelegant answer which is not
that there is a filiform plan as to

296
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:52,440
how do you move out of this and
anyway, we have been criticised we

297
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,800
have not being clear enough, there is
not enough clarity of message, I

298
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:00,200
think the message is absolutely
crystal clear. Stay-at-home and

299
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,360
therefore protect the NHS and
therefore save lives and if you

300
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:09,440
ask... There is no point in us
standing on the two -- backward step

301
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,480
and banging saucepans and then taking
a fit of the pedal, if you

302
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,880
listen to anyone working in the NHS or
has lost someone or had a fight

303
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:20,640
for their own life on this, what did
they say? They say please,

304
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,920
stay-at-home and follow the advice. We
have got to take this one step at

305
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:28,360
a time. I realise it is boring and
difficult. I don't think it is

306
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:33,200
boring. I think it is interesting. You
have to stick with the plan,

307
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:39,200
Kirsty. Let us look at what Labour
might be suggesting for example, let

308
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:45,040
us talk about Sadiq Khan, Justin, in
London, what he is saying to Grant

309
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:49,880
Shapps, the Transport Minister, is we
would like to see all public

310
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:55,400
transport have masks for every one
travelling. Do think that is

311
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:01,400
something that Labour as a policy be
supporting? Well, I think again, to

312
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,400
repeat what people have said in the
past, this is something that needs

313
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,160
to be guided by the science and I
think there is certainly now a

314
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:15,040
growing body of evidence that masks
may be part of the solution to this.

315
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,800
Certainly London transport, which of
course is notoriously overcrowded,

316
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,000
is somewhere where a lot of people
will probably feel that that is

317
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,200
something I would want to do,
regardless of what the official

318
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:29,240
advice was. I think it should be
looked at closely. I think the big

319
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,600
thing for strategy in the current
situation is actually the testing

320
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,920
that is going on, as your piece
already said before, we have not

321
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,960
really gone anywhere near the numbers
that we were originally

322
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,800
promised and I think that if we are to
review the lockdown, we need a

323
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:50,000
proper tracing strategy which means we
will have to have mass testing as

324
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,040
well and I think until we get to that
point, we are going to be

325
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:00,000
struggling a little bit to move into
another area without the risk of a

326
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,600
rebound. You agree with the government
on that, we are in a

327
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:09,000
situation where we don't have the
amount of testing that we need and

328
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,800
we are meant to have very quickly, so
you would be with the government

329
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,400
on that strategy, but you can't
actually move ahead until you get

330
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,600
mass testing in place. There is no
doubt that the government criteria,

331
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:27,520
which as you rightly point out, it is
a criteria to decide the next

332
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,280
phase and identify the shortcomings
today which include the lack of

333
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:39,200
testing capacity and also the
infallibility of PPE. We need to

334
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,200
understand what has gone wrong with
the testing ratio because as you

335
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,800
pointed out earlier, it was back in
January that the government

336
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,280
announced that they had got this world
leading test and clearly

337
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,920
Germany have managed to get into a
situation where they have been able

338
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,720
to mass-produce that we haven't and we
need to understand what the

339
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,000
problem is with that because that will
be key in getting through to

340
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,480
the next phase. If I could move on,
finally, with you, Steve, really

341
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,520
referring back to what Martin was
saying, do you think there will be a

342
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,640
tipping point at which time the
economic damage from the lockdown,

343
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,680
including two people because my
personal health, well-being and

344
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:20,160
future is outweighs the damage from
the virus itself? No, I don't agree

345
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,680
that it is a choice between the
economy and public health, I think

346
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:29,800
this is a whole national effort. To
give you an example, we heard today

347
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,720
about new ventilators which are being
developed, the McLaren Formula

348
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:38,400
1 team are involved, if we do that,
then business returns to doing

349
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,640
business as usual and we need them to
carry on with the national

350
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,400
effort. There are plenty of companies
that make ten but they are

351
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,760
making alcohol hand gel and that is
really important. I think there is a

352
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,960
way out of this, but it is ultimately
not just going to be

353
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,800
about testing in the community, people
wearing a dirty or clean

354
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,000
wristband, it is ultimately the only
real way out of the pandemic is when

355
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,440
you have a axing and what will have to
happen is have a sensible,

356
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,160
evidence-based, led by the science,
and social distancing is going to be

357
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,000
with us for a long time and I think we
are going to have to get used to

358
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,720
that, until there is a vaccine in
place, and that is the reality of

359
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:26,440
this. There is no textbook as to how
to get yourself out of a restriction

360
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,840
from a pandemic, it will have to be
based on the evidence, as the virus

361
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,120
develops, and three weeks is a long
way off right now, but I am

362
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,160
absolutely certain the government made
the right decision today. They

363
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:40,000
made it based on the science and I
think that the messaging is crystal

364
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,720
clear from the government and I
realise that it's frustrating for

365
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,760
people, it is frustrating for me and I
realise it is frustrating for the

366
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,320
media but it is working and it is the
right thing to do. Thank you

367
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,320
very much indeed.

368
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,960
No one can yet know the social,
economic and political consequences

369
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,600
of the coronavirus disease, and talk
of a return to normal

370
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,520
once this is all over seems almost
implausible.

371
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,240
So what will define the world
post-Covid 19?

372
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,400
Earlier, I spoke to David Miliband,
the former

373
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,360
British Foreign Secretary, now the
Chief Executive Officer of

374
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,880
the International Rescue Committee for
his perspectives

375
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,840
on what happens next.

376
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:18,040
I think there is no doubt that the
scars of this crisis will last a

377
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:24,520
long time. But the vital thing is
whether or not we learn the lessons

378
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:31,120
of this crisis. The lesson is about
the holes in the global safety net,

379
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,640
the massive inequalities, three
billion people have no access to

380
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:40,760
running water and within countries
like the UK, the poorest are being

381
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:46,400
hit hardest. It is also about
nationalism against

382
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,560
internationalism. And I think there is
a vital question about the role

383
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:55,880
of government. It is a new economic
and social contract if we learn the

384
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,160
lessons properly. That is the only way
to address the social and

385
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:05,800
economic ills as well as the health
ones. We were talking about the

386
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,800
social/economic contract, do you think
that will change now? I hope

387
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:13,160
it will change and the undervaluation
of all sorts of

388
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:17,600
sectors of society that are recognised
to be central, the key

389
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:26,040
workers are in the health service and
they're carer, but if you're

390
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,280
stacking shelves, you're part of a
vital role and we know that

391
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:37,320
especially the last ten years in the
UK, but globally over a longer time,

392
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,440
the growth of inequality has scarred
those countries. When you have

393
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,840
someone like Boris Johnson in that
heart felt video when he left the

394
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:52,280
hospital, talking about the NHS saving
his life in a sense the

395
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,960
bedrock of society becomes something
like the NHS, do you think that is a

396
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:01,000
cultural and emotional shift? We could
have a 1945 moment. But the

397
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,640
danger is we have a 1918 moment when a
land fit for heroes was promised

398
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,120
but the lessons were not learned and
the social safety net was not fixed

399
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:16,800
or built and we led through the 30 it
is mass unemployment and globally

400
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:21,000
the failure of the league of nation
gss and the collapse world into war,

401
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,640
we know that story. The post 1945
moment was a different moment. I do

402
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:33,000
believe that this crisis, so global
so, universal, is so big that any

403
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:41,440
notion of "return" is not just on.
There is a danger

404
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,720
There is a danger that the zen phones
see this as their moment.

405
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,680
This politics of anger and
demonisation has no answers when it

406
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:53,960
cops to question of health or economy
that you have been debating.

407
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,720
You have Donald Trump railing against
the WHO and their handling

408
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:03,760
of coronavirus out-Breck. It Trump
right that the WHO didn't move

409
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:11,600
quickly enough. They made mistakes and
the Chinese practiced denial.

410
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,200
But the World Health Organization
needs to be stronger not weaker,

411
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:22,680
there will be greater health
insecurity if we undermine them. The

412
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:28,320
danger of the cuts that are being
discussed by President Trump, they

413
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,880
are a potential death sentence for
people who rely on vaccine and

414
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,000
programmes that is funded by the
American contribution to the World

415
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:43,680
Health Organization. The danger hear
the the post Covid world falls into

416
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:47,000
a US versus China stand off is real.
The Chinese will say it is their

417
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,520
system that has proved its worth. It
is important to say yes there are

418
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,960
democratic governments like in the
United States that have not handled

419
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:01,040
it. But countries like Germany show
open and free societies can deal

420
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:07,640
with cry cease like this. Ursula von
der Leyen apologised on behalf of

421
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:15,240
the EU to Italy for his failure to
help when the coronavirus hit. Do

422
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,240
you think it poses a threat to the EU.
The way Italy has been felt to

423
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:23,680
be on its own has not been a good
advertisement for the way in which

424
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:30,360
the EU can pull together and it has
made ideas of European solidarity

425
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:34,800
seem unreal. What you're seeing from
Ursula von der Leyen is a

426
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,000
determination that Europe will play
its part collectively as well as

427
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,120
individually. Europe has to pull
together and that will be important

428
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,160
not just in health and economic terms,
but also in political terms

429
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:51,840
and it is vital that it doesn't see or
find the Covid crisis as a spear

430
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,920
aimed at its heart. Thank you very
much. Where

431
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,560
As we emerge from this pandemic,
amongst the welter of reports

432
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,440
and inquiries, one thing is already
clear - the bravery of workers

433
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,560
in the NHS and the social care sector
as they help save lives

434
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,280
and care for the infected.

435
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,680
Many of these workers are from
overseas - the latest

436
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,080
Oxford Migration Observatory figures
for non UK citizens in healthcare

437
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,480
jobs is 20%; in care homes it's 18%.

438
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,040
But how many of these will remain
after Brexit?

439
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,920
One argument for us leaving the EU was
that the government wants

440
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:27,840
to upskill the UK workforce.

441
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,440
As many as 2 million more of us could
be unemployed by the summer -

442
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,880
so will the UK workforce be able to
deliver what we need most?

443
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,880
Take back control.

444
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,520
Three words that define Brexit, but
the coronavirus is no respecter

445
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,760
of borders or nationalities.

446
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,680
The sight of seasonal fruit pickers
from Romania

447
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,760
arriving at Stansted today, headed for
the south-east

448
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,600
of England and Lincolnshire,
underlines that the entry

449
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,280
of so-called unskilled workers to the
UK, on average 90,000

450
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,280
fruit pickers a year, allowed to
remain for three months

451
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,920
under the new rules, may have to the
resort the longer

452
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:08,920
the virus plagues us.

453
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,840
Under lockdown, UK workers are not
allowed to head for the fields

454
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,480
and our fruit and vegetable crops will
not wait for this

455
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,760
disease to pass.

456
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,640
We need help and there may be many
more planes carrying even

457
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,560
more pickers than usual.

458
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:28,280
There was no more stark or poignant
reminder of the debt owed to foreign

459
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,680
nationals working here during this
crisis than the video message

460
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,080
the Prime Minister delivered after he
left St Thomas' hospital

461
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,400
to begin his convalescence.

462
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,320
Amongst the many NHS hospital staff
you mention,

463
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,480
he said he was especially grateful to
two nurses.

464
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,520
Jenny from New Zealand, Invercargill
on the South Island,

465
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:52,440
to be exact and Luis from Portugal,
near Porto.

466
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,560
Jenny and Luis are part of an Army of
NHS and care workers

467
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:01,040
who are integral to the welfare system
and our welfare.

468
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,680
Many so-called low skilled migrants on
the Covid front line,

469
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,360
refuse collectors, bus drivers and
supermarket staff,

470
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,000
would not pass the new immigration
rules under newly released guidance

471
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,200
by the Home Secretary.

472
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,800
Something's come from overseas and
taken your jobs, but not me.

473
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,840
Or me.

474
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,600
Or me.

475
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,800
This week, a video was posted on
social media to accompany a poem,

476
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,440
You Clap For Me Now, to make the case
for immigration

477
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:32,840
and the danger of racism.

478
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,720
Brexit is a fixture, but what is not
fixed is how much

479
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,600
this era of the coronavirus will
impact on who are the most

480
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:46,560
valued people in our community and in
wider society.

481
00:35:49,440 --> 00:36:03,520
I hope to be joined by the Labour
Party MP

482
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,520
the Labour MP

483
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,720
Rushanara Ali and David Goodhart,

484
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,120
head of immigration and integration at
Policy Exchange and author

485
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,320
of The Road to Somewhere

486
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,920
Looking at the debt that Boris Johnson
paid to two workers and I

487
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,800
wonder if the mood has shifted in this
country about who is valued and

488
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:20,520
whether they come from here, there or
anywhere, does that matter? I

489
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:26,120
certainly think it is true that ethnic
minority Brits have been

490
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:31,440
visibly in the front line of the
crisis, as NHS doctors as nurses and

491
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:37,280
on what one might call the home front
of the invisible army of low

492
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:45,680
paid, low status jobs in retail and
cleaning and indeed care. But the

493
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:52,720
idea that... These people are kind of
second class citizens, who have

494
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,520
only just now been embraced by
mainstream Britain I think flies in

495
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:04,880
the face of all the evidence,
everything we know from opini polls

496
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:12,400
and the public domain. Look at the
cabinet. It is 8% of Brit, only 8%

497
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,360
of Brits who say you have to be white
to be valued. I think what is

498
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:21,840
coming out is that people that are
most valued, you know, are people

499
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:26,400
that actually do the jobs that are
needed most now and if you look

500
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:32,680
at... That huge group, particularly in
the poorly-paid care sector, a

501
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:38,040
lot of people that do that job would
not qualify, because they earn so

502
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:43,560
little, to be able to come to the UK
in the future and now it used to be

503
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:50,040
talked in abstract terms about care
home staff from other European

504
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:54,600
countries and how we will miss them.
Now we know it is important to have

505
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,920
that expertise regarded in many ways
as being low skilled and therefore

506
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,680
not important to this country? Yeah, I
mean I think, I hope we are going

507
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:07,280
to have some change in the status
hierarchy. It is very noticeable

508
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:16,240
that most of the key workers, the
people that keep the show on the

509
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:26,200
road, are not graduates, we have made
cog nittive ability the

510
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:30,600
greatest esteem. But it is raising the
pay and status of the jobs, so

511
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:38,480
people here would be more attracted to
do them. We have a recruitment

512
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:44,680
crisis in social care. It employs 1.4
million and they have 120,000

513
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:51,560
vacancies. The average churn is 30%.
We need to do something more

514
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:56,760
radical. Interesting to say that, what
I would say, if you look at the

515
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:02,240
wages, for example, a carer in a care
home would start at 12 and a

516
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:08,880
half thousand. You know, a supermarket
worker who now is key to

517
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:14,520
whether people can get food and drink
to keep them going, might earn

518
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:20,600
as little as 11,000. Lots of UK
workers don't want those jobs. So...

519
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,240
Those people are not going to be able
to fill jobs, because they're

520
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,480
not going to be earning enough to get
into this country. They have to

521
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:35,040
be learning, unless they're NHS
workers, something like £24,000 to

522
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,600
be welcome in is in country, but no
British person has stepped up to the

523
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:45,440
plate for these jobs. Well, we are
going to see that change, employers

524
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,800
will have to start training more. That
is the whole point of

525
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,000
Government's post Brexit immigration
policy. Nothing has changed on

526
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:01,080
immigration, the story remains the
same, we are a pretty open society.

527
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:06,680
We have had historic levels of
immigration and there is a national

528
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:12,240
consensus that that those numbers
should be reduced. Remain an open

529
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:18,000
society, but reduce the numbers.
Ethnic minority Brits also believe

530
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,800
that. We have a new system that is
pretty open at the hard skill level

531
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:30,600
it has come down and become more open
you only have to be A-level

532
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:39,200
type qualifications to be highly
skilled and earn 24, 25 grand. At

533
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,360
the lower end, they need to train
people better so people want do

534
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:48,560
those jobs. That is a reasonable thing
and it is popular with public

535
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:54,680
opinion. I'm afraid technology is
defeating us somewhat, thank you for

536
00:40:54,680 --> 00:41:00,960
sticking with it and we are sorry we
are lost our other guest. Here is a

537
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:10,480
look at the front-pages. The FT: The
Guardian says lockdown may last to

538
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:20,120
June. A picture of war veteran Tom
Moore raising money for the NHS.

539
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:27,440
Three more weeks under lockdown say it
is Mirror. The Mail says there

540
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:38,960
are plans for office asked staff to be
asked to wear masks. That is all

541
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,160
from
