Hi, I'm De'Graft.

2
00:00:02,455 --> 00:00:03,895
It's Thursday,
and this is Newsround.

3
00:00:03,895 --> 00:00:08,655
Here's what's coming up
in the next few minutes.

4
00:00:08,655 --> 00:00:10,815
The Prime Minister announces big
changes to schools that

5
00:00:10,815 --> 00:00:11,043
will affect you guys.

6
00:00:11,043 --> 00:00:15,181
And we catch up with the unusual
sports still going on!

7
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:19,285
And the footie stars
with a new type of training.

9
00:00:29,495 --> 00:00:32,135
First up, the government have
announced big changes - meaning that

10
00:00:32,135 --> 00:00:34,535
most of you won't be
going to school next week.

11
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,935
Here's more on why.

12
00:00:37,935 --> 00:00:43,495
Yesterday afternoon
the Prime Minister stood up

13
00:00:43,495 --> 00:00:45,655
with his scientific advisors
and announced a big change

14
00:00:45,655 --> 00:00:48,735
to children's lives
all over the country.

15
00:00:48,735 --> 00:00:51,335
From tomorrow schools will close
right across the UK and children,

16
00:00:51,335 --> 00:00:53,495
like many of their parents,
will have to spend

17
00:00:53,495 --> 00:00:54,535
their time at home.

18
00:00:54,535 --> 00:00:58,655
However, some schools will stay open
for children of key workers,

19
00:00:58,655 --> 00:01:02,455
like parents who work
for the emergency services,

20
00:01:02,455 --> 00:01:05,095
along with children who need extra
support, and some school staff

21
00:01:05,095 --> 00:01:06,135
will look after them.

22
00:01:06,135 --> 00:01:08,175
After schools shut their gates
from Friday afternoon,

23
00:01:08,175 --> 00:01:13,175
they will remain closed for most
pupils, for the vast majority

24
00:01:13,175 --> 00:01:16,015
of pupils, until further notice.

25
00:01:16,015 --> 00:01:20,415
The objective is to slow the spread
of the virus and, as I say,

26
00:01:20,415 --> 00:01:24,135
we judge this is the right moment
to do that.

27
00:01:24,135 --> 00:01:27,695
And it's not just lessons.

28
00:01:27,695 --> 00:01:35,655
Exams like SATs, GCSEs and A levels
will no longer happen this summer.

29
00:01:38,175 --> 00:01:40,335
The Prime Minister promised that
pupils' learning wouldn't be

30
00:01:40,335 --> 00:01:42,495
affected and those taking exams
would get the qualifications

31
00:01:42,495 --> 00:01:44,415
they've worked for,
although he didn't say how.

32
00:01:44,415 --> 00:01:47,055
The government's chief scientist
was keen to say that children don't

33
00:01:47,055 --> 00:01:49,215
seem to be badly affected
by coronavirus and schools

34
00:01:49,215 --> 00:01:52,815
are still safe places to be but this
big step is aimed to stop germs

35
00:01:52,815 --> 00:01:57,415
spreading more widely.

36
00:01:57,415 --> 00:01:59,815
We're sure you have loads more
questions about coronavirus -

37
00:01:59,815 --> 00:02:02,215
well, doctors Chris and Zand
from Operation Ouch have come

38
00:02:02,215 --> 00:02:03,895
to the rescue and answered loads!

39
00:02:03,895 --> 00:02:07,615
So, take a look.

40
00:02:07,615 --> 00:02:09,855
Schools closing may seem really
disappointing for you,

41
00:02:09,855 --> 00:02:12,055
but the same thing happened
to students in China

42
00:02:12,055 --> 00:02:15,415
a few weeks ago - and now they've
had some great news!

43
00:02:15,415 --> 00:02:19,695
For the first time they've
reported NO new infections

44
00:02:19,695 --> 00:02:24,775
since coronavirus began -
and some schools are even reopening!

45
00:02:24,775 --> 00:02:32,135
Martin's been taking a look.

46
00:03:04,015 --> 00:03:08,495
But they're back
at school so yippee!

47
00:03:08,495 --> 00:03:12,815
Now, most sports in the UK are off -
so it's a chance for us to check out

48
00:03:12,815 --> 00:03:13,855
some more unusual ones.

49
00:03:13,855 --> 00:03:15,295
Take a look at banger racing!

50
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:17,695
Despite hardly any crowds watching,
these drivers are speeding around

51
00:03:17,695 --> 00:03:21,295
the tracks in old cars with windows
- and even doors - missing -

52
00:03:21,295 --> 00:03:27,175
they're trying to win the race
and also not fall apart!

53
00:03:27,175 --> 00:03:30,775
Last up - with most of the sporting
world on hold - lots of stars

54
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:32,215
are twiddling their thumbs at home.

55
00:03:32,215 --> 00:03:34,855
It's caused some footballers
to start off a new craze -

56
00:03:34,855 --> 00:03:35,895
the loo roll challenge.

57
00:03:35,895 --> 00:03:38,855
Here are some of them in action.

58
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:39,775
I will not be trying that one at
home.

59
00:04:39,775 --> 00:04:42,655
Right, guys, that's all for now
but don't forget to head over

60
00:04:42,655 --> 00:04:45,775
to the website for loads more -
including where you can check out

61
00:04:45,775 --> 00:04:47,935
the Spongebob Squarepants hotel,
take our quiz about strange

62
00:04:47,935 --> 00:04:50,775
celebrity food and read how Wales
is going to ban single-use plastics

63
00:04:50,775 --> 00:04:51,855
next year.

64
00:04:51,855 --> 00:04:54,695
I'll be with you guys right here,
live on CBBC tomorrow morning.

65
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:57,615
See you later!
