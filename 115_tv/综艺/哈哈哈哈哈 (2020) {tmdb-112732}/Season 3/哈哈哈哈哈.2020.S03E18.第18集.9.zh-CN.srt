2
00:00:09,522 --> 00:00:11,082
Hey there, De'Graft here.

3
00:00:11,082 --> 00:00:15,562
Welcome to Newsround.

4
00:00:15,562 --> 00:00:18,402
First up schools in Scotland
and Wales are to close from Friday

5
00:00:18,402 --> 00:00:21,522
because of coronavirus.

6
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:24,162
It's also expected that schools
in England will also close -

7
00:00:24,162 --> 00:00:26,522
but we're waiting for an annoucement
from the UK Government

8
00:00:26,522 --> 00:00:27,602
about that soon.

9
00:00:27,602 --> 00:00:31,762
It's the best way to make sure
we can all stay safe and healthy.

10
00:00:31,762 --> 00:00:35,482
We know that lots of you will be
worried or upset by this.

11
00:00:35,482 --> 00:00:37,602
Please head to Newsround
online where there is lots

12
00:00:37,602 --> 00:00:38,842
of advice to help you.

13
00:00:38,842 --> 00:00:44,482
We're all here to look
after each other.

14
00:00:44,482 --> 00:00:46,642
Now, across the world people
are limiting their socialising

15
00:00:46,642 --> 00:00:48,602
to help them keep safe
from the virus.

16
00:00:48,602 --> 00:00:51,682
In some countries - like Ireland -
schools are closed too and parents

17
00:00:51,682 --> 00:00:52,722
are working from home.

18
00:00:52,722 --> 00:00:53,762
So what's that like?

19
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,242
Well, meet Eabha.

20
00:00:55,242 --> 00:00:58,082
She's from Dublin and told us
what her life's like and how

21
00:00:58,082 --> 00:01:06,002
she's spending her time.

22
00:01:06,002 --> 00:01:08,162
I'm Eabha, I'm 11
and I live in Dublin.

23
00:01:08,162 --> 00:01:11,002
Because of the coronavirus I'm off
school, and my mum and dad

24
00:01:11,002 --> 00:01:12,722
are working from home
on their computers.

25
00:01:12,722 --> 00:01:16,042
I got schoolwork set by my teacher
and I got a novel to read.

26
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:18,202
My sports also is all cancelled,
and the playgrounds

27
00:01:18,202 --> 00:01:19,322
and libraries are closed.

28
00:01:19,322 --> 00:01:23,042
During the day, I might walk my dog.

29
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:26,482
I do sports with my
sister, but I'd stay...

30
00:01:26,482 --> 00:01:28,682
Social distancing,
so I only do it with her.

31
00:01:28,682 --> 00:01:32,042
But all the shops are still open.

32
00:01:32,042 --> 00:01:35,962
But even if you see someone, you can
speak to them from a distance.

33
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:40,362
It's good because you don't
have to go to school.

34
00:01:40,362 --> 00:01:42,762
It's bad because the reason
like you are off school

35
00:01:42,762 --> 00:01:47,762
is because of the coronavirus
and that's not a good reason.

36
00:01:47,762 --> 00:01:50,322
I'm a bit worried about it
because vulnerable people

37
00:01:50,322 --> 00:01:52,962
like grandparents or people
who are sick could get it.

38
00:01:52,962 --> 00:01:58,162
I'm not worried for myself because I
don't think I'd get very sick.

39
00:01:58,162 --> 00:02:01,482
I think it's a good idea to close
the schools because then you can't

40
00:02:01,482 --> 00:02:04,122
get it from other people and give it
to vulnerable people

41
00:02:04,122 --> 00:02:09,162
like your grandparents
or people who are sick.

42
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:13,042
We're sure you have loads more
questions about all of this.

43
00:02:13,042 --> 00:02:15,442
Well, Doctors Chris and Xand
from Operation Ouch have come

44
00:02:15,442 --> 00:02:16,882
to the rescue and answered loads!

45
00:02:16,882 --> 00:02:21,442
So take a look.

46
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:23,602
Now, lots of live football may
have been postponed.

47
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:26,482
But that's not going
to stop some clubs.

48
00:02:26,482 --> 00:02:29,362
League Two side Leyton Orient have
set up a Fifa tournament -

49
00:02:29,362 --> 00:02:31,042
which they've called
Ultimate Quaran-TEAM -

50
00:02:31,042 --> 00:02:37,842
which sounds a bit like quarantine.

51
00:02:37,842 --> 00:02:40,682
It involves 128 professional clubs,
including Manchester City,

52
00:02:40,682 --> 00:02:42,562
Ajax, Roma and Benfica,
with each club chosing

53
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:43,642
who represents them.

54
00:02:43,642 --> 00:02:46,522
The draw was made last night -
one of the biggest names

55
00:02:46,522 --> 00:02:54,482
involved is Andros Towsend,
representing Crystal Palace.

56
00:02:54,922 --> 00:02:57,082
Next to Your Planet -
where we've got bears

57
00:02:57,082 --> 00:02:59,442
coming out of hibernation,
trees being planted and the amazing

58
00:02:59,442 --> 00:03:02,162
benefits of sea grass.

59
00:03:02,162 --> 00:03:05,842
Hi, Hayley here with the latest news
affecting your planet.

60
00:03:05,842 --> 00:03:08,202
First to Russia, Finland and Canada,
where there have been

61
00:03:08,202 --> 00:03:11,002
lots of sightings of bears.

62
00:03:11,002 --> 00:03:13,402
That wouldn't seem too unusual,
but this is their normal

63
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:15,322
hibernation time.

64
00:03:15,322 --> 00:03:19,162
It's been an unusually warm
winter in many places.

65
00:03:19,162 --> 00:03:22,882
And the bears are awake
from their deep sleeps

66
00:03:22,882 --> 00:03:26,882
and on the prowl for food much
earlier than normal.

67
00:03:26,882 --> 00:03:29,322
But the problem is that
at this time of year,

68
00:03:29,322 --> 00:03:31,922
it will be much harder to find
the plants and small

69
00:03:31,922 --> 00:03:33,442
animals they normally eat.

70
00:03:33,442 --> 00:03:36,282
Next to the UK, where forestry
workers are responding to a call

71
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:40,202
to plant millions of trees
to tackle climate change.

72
00:03:40,202 --> 00:03:42,322
This is Canadian Shelby Barber,
who can plant more

73
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:45,762
than 4,000 trees a day.

74
00:03:45,762 --> 00:03:48,402
Sounds like hard work,
but she takes it in her stride.

75
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:50,322
I've personally in three
years planted just over

76
00:03:50,322 --> 00:03:52,842
half a million trees.

77
00:03:52,842 --> 00:03:55,562
Environmentalists, though,
are concerned that governments

78
00:03:55,562 --> 00:03:57,962
and industry think that planting
trees is an easy option

79
00:03:57,962 --> 00:04:02,242
and they think those measures
alone are not enough.

80
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:06,002
Finally, staying in the UK,
we had to Pembrokeshire,

81
00:04:06,002 --> 00:04:12,882
where scientists are planting
seagrass seeds under the sea.

82
00:04:12,882 --> 00:04:15,482
The seeds have been collected
by volunteers from around the UK

83
00:04:15,482 --> 00:04:17,442
and divers are planting
over1 million of them.

84
00:04:17,442 --> 00:04:22,122
And divers are planting over
one million of them.

85
00:04:22,122 --> 00:04:24,042
Seagrass is an amazing
plant because it helps

86
00:04:24,042 --> 00:04:25,722
prevent coastal erosion,
provides habitat for wildlife

87
00:04:25,722 --> 00:04:28,082
and collects carbon,
which it can store 30 times faster

88
00:04:28,082 --> 00:04:29,162
than land forests.

89
00:04:29,162 --> 00:04:30,602
Well, that's it for this week.

90
00:04:30,602 --> 00:04:33,882
See you next time for more news
affecting your planet.

91
00:04:33,882 --> 00:04:37,082
Finally, there is so much stuff
on Newsround's website that has

92
00:04:37,082 --> 00:04:38,962
nothing to do with coronavirus!

93
00:04:38,962 --> 00:04:41,802
Hooray!

94
00:04:41,802 --> 00:04:44,362
Why not try a quiz about pandas?

95
00:04:44,362 --> 00:04:46,602
Or check out the unicorn dog!

96
00:04:46,602 --> 00:04:54,562
But most of all, keep smiling
and keep watching Newsround.

97
00:04:54,882 --> 00:04:57,402
See you tomorrow!
