61
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,720
打开他的世界之书  暗自思量

62
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,510
"今天谁最需要我"

to the brothels on Broadway,

68
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,460
他们喝着酒
they are tipping back their bottles,

69
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,820
在小巷里媾和
rolling bones in the alley,

70

113
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,950
她是不是一个奇迹
Oh, isn't she a wonder?

114
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,180
一座灯塔
A beacon?

115
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,740
我们罪人的滩头堡
A beachhead for us sinners?

116
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,820
如果可以  请大方一些
Oh, give generously if you can,

117
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,800
为周围的光芒献上一份爱

118
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,130
留心我们修女的劝导
Heed the words of our Sister,

119
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,140
在这个美妙的早晨
and dig as deep into your pockets

120
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:48,380
尽量慷慨解囊  乐善好施
as God will allow you on this great and good morning!

121
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,420
摒弃罪恶  接纳美德
Kick those sins out, and welcome those virtues in!

122
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,330
我想看到盘子高高叠起

123
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,910
我想看到桶满溢出

124

125
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,980
是的  他们在等你

00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,240
要我私下见他们吗
You want me to meet with them privately?

129
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,600
不  必须是现在
No, no, it has to be now.

130
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,830
我先喘口气
I just-- I have to catch my breath.

131
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,220
-我表现得好吗  -当然
- I was good out there? - Oh, you were.

132
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,980
仿若圣人  比肩摩西
Halfway to Heaven, a mile from Moses.

133
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,980
{\an8}《圣经》故事中犹太人古代领袖

134
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,440
爱丽丝修女  这是马修和艾米莉·多德森
Sister Alice, this is Matthew and Emily Dodson.

135
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,230
我听说以后  每日每夜都在祈祷
I've been praying every night and every morning

136
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,870
艾米莉小姐
since I heard, Miss Emily.

137
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,530
谢谢你  修女
Thank you, Sister.

138
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,310
现在只能依靠上帝了
God is about all we have right now.

139
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,590
他与你同在
And He is with you.

140
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,160
来  坐下
Come on, sit down.

141
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,030
我们在家里待了快一周了
We've been in our home for nearly a week.

142
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,610
我想着还是
I thought it might be a good idea

143
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,830
带艾米莉回圣殿吧
to get Emily back here to the Temple.

144
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,010
然后我们收到了你让我们来后台的邀请
Then we received your invitation to come backstage.

145
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,330
我在报纸上看到你们的照片  我就对妈妈说
I saw your picture in the paper and I said to my mother,

146

我们只是在闲聊
Right now, we're just having a little chat.

206

你才不是警察

I'm a proud man and she's been running out on me.

210
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,090
我不会容忍这种事
And I won't abide it.

211
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,760
她昨晚只是去了教会
She went nowhere but Zion Baptist last night.

212
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:05,710
你怎么知道
How you know that?

213
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,010
因为克拉拉和我在那遇到她了

我们一起喝了点酒  一起跨了年
We all had punch, and saw the year out.

215
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,560
我说的对吗  詹姆斯女士
Ain't that so, Miss James?

216
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,890
所以不如把枪交给我吧
So why don't you just give me that?

00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:17,260
这是新开始的一天  哪里糟到要杀人了
Day for fresh starts. Ain't nothing never been so bad.

218

再也不要拿枪指着警察
Don't you ever pull a gun on a police officer.

别过来  不然把你也抓起来
Step on back now unless you want some too.

225
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,490
你要干什么
The hell you playing at?

226
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,690
德雷克警官  有些东西你得看一下
Officer Drake, there's something you gotta see.

227
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,080
往里走  206号房

我不能再过去了

把人从教堂里带出来  天啊
Pulling him out of church, for God's sake.

231
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,580

There's a process, Detective. You're to notify his counsel.

232
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,270
-你不是来了吗  -事先通知
- Well, you're here, aren't you? - Notify beforehand.

233

把我们骗来这里
Bring us down here under false pretenses

267
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,810
就为了打我们个措手不及

-他对此无可奉告...  -看到他从后门进去
- He has nothing to say... - Saw him go in the back door.

278
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,040
-我真不在  -看到他...
- I wasn't there! - Saw him come out...

279
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,260
-我对天发誓  一分钟后出来
- I swear to God! - ...A minute later

280
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,660
手里抱着东西
with something in his arms.

281
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,830
能卖钱的东西
Something he could turn into money.

282
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,200
一笔能快速偿还债务的赃款
A quick score to settle his debts,

283
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,690
因为你欠了一屁股的债  不是吗  马修
because you owe all over town, don't you, Matthew?

284
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,330
我要提起正式诉讼
I'm gonna lodge a formal complaint.

285
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,490
你们对他如此纠缠不休...
Badgering this man with nothing but--

286
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,400
我有他的作案动机和时机
I got motive. I got opportunity.

287
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,670
是吗  你有...
Yeah, you have...

288
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:35,300
梅纳德  你就只有一桶屎
Maynard, you have entirely a bucket of eels.

289
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:36,610
是吗
Really?

290
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,050
你打算告诉陪审团这个人绑架了自己的儿子
You're gonna tell a jury that this man kidnapped his son

291
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,410
就因为他负债累累
because he had debts?

292
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,820
所以他计划向自己敲诈一笔
And that his plan was to extort money,

293
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,780
他根本拿不出手的钱
which he clearly didn't have, from himself?

294
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,810
那请你的便
Please, be my guest.

295
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,690
我准备花两块钱理个发
I'm gonna get a two-dollar haircut

296
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,620
好让我能帅气地出现在报纸上笑掉大牙
so that I look good in the papers laughing my ass off.

297
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,550
我们走  马修  你们真可耻
Come on, Matthew. Shame on all of you.

298
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,970
这其实也是我们想不通的一点
That was the one thing we couldn't quite figure.

299
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:01,970
为何要绑架一个杂货店主的小孩
Why pull a snatch job on a grocer's kid?

300
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,800
还勒索十万  这么大数目
And a hundred thousand? Why so steep?

301
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,140
没道理啊
Makes no sense.

302
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,490
除非那人知道他身上有钱
Unless he knew he had the money

303
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,090
或者知道他能弄到这笔钱
or knew that he could get the money.

304
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,450
比如说从他有钱的爸爸那儿
Like from his rich father, perhaps.

305
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,290
不过谁又会知道这种事呢
But who'd know a thing like that?

306
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,060
毕竟这是个严守的秘密
I mean, such a well-kept secret.

307
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,080
你要猜猜看吗  多德森先生
Wanna take a guess, Mr. Dodson?

308
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,070
还是说应该叫你  巴格利先生
Or should we call you Mr. Baggerly?

309
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,330
巴格利
Baggerly?

310
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,150
赫尔曼是你父亲
Herman is your father?

311
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,730
你被捕了  硬汉
You're under arrest, tough guy.

312
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,460
新年快乐
Happy New Year.

313
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,550
理发的事就先别想了  EB
Might wanna hold off on that haircut, E.B.

314
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,040
-等等  -让我来
- Now wait a minute. - Here, let me get that.

315
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,460
巴恩斯  你不能...
Barnes, you're not getting...

316
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,680
你...
You're...

317
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,510
-巴恩斯  这样不对...  -马修
- Barnes, this isn't-- - Matthew?

318
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,790
-这样不对  艾米莉  -马修
- This is not the way. Emily. - Matthew?

319
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,810
-这是怎么回事  -好了  冷静下
- What is going on here? - All right. Just calm down.

320
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,350
-马修  -我必须得告诉你
- Matthew? - I have to tell you

321
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,880
-现在发生的事  -马修
- what's happened there... -  Matthew?

322
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,360
-怎么了  马修  -我们都始料未及
- What's-- Matthew. - it's nothing we didn't expect.

323
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,560
马修  马修
Matthew! Matthew!

324
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,940
-他招供了吗  -是什么罪名
- He confessed? - What's the charge?

325
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,200
你要起诉多德森吗
You're nailing Dodson for it?

326
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,530
他是凶手吗
He's going down for it?

327
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:10,250
马修·多德森因密谋绑架罪被逮捕
Matthew Dodson is being held on conspiracy kidnapping charges,

328
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,460
这也再次证明  在我的管理下
proving once again that, under my watch,

329
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:15,260
我们能快速镇压犯罪活动
criminal activities will be quickly put down

330
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,270
也能严格执法
and the laws energetically enforced

331
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,580
以造福众生  拍吧
to the benefit of all. Take it.

332
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,330
就这样
That's it.

333
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:27,530
多德森  多德森先生
Dodson. Mr. Dodson.

334
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,470
密苏里州的一个女人
A woman in Missouri.

335
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,950
她骗了我
She lied to me.

336
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,680
当然是我的错  但我也是被骗了
My fault certainly, but I was lied to.

337
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,210
我那时还不是现在这样
I was a different man then.

338
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,540
那么马修是你儿子吗
So Matthew is your son?

339
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,900
他几年前找到我
He found me a few years ago.

340
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,250
我们算是做了个安排
We made kind of an arrangement.

341
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,470
他信奉上帝
He would give himself to the Lord,

342
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:02,270
我会为他提供在这安居乐业
I would provide the means to resettle him here

343
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,690
所需的一切
and start a business.

344
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,860
就算有烦恼  他也是个敬畏主的孩子了
He's a God-fearing boy now. Not without his troubles.

345
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,350
比如他现在面临的绑架指控这种烦恼吗
Like the kidnapping charge he's up against?

346
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,070
他绝不会参与那样的事
He would never get involved with anything like that.

347
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,970
绝不吗  他跟警察说谎很熟练
Never? He sure lied to the cops like a pro.

348
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:18,030
因为他在案发当晚
Because he was engaged in illegal gambling

349
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,340
参与了非法赌博
on the night in question.

350
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,640
在那个情况下  我能理解他的犹豫
Given the circumstances, I can understand his hesitation.

351
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,430
他们现在有个目击证人看到他在家
They now have a witness who saw him at home.

352
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,980
你就要去找一个证人证明他在赌博
And you're gonna find one that saw him rolling dice.

353
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,840
我保证  梅森先生
I assure you, Mr. Mason,

354
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,040
我儿子不会做害人的事
my son is incapable of harming anyone,

355
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,890
更别说害我孙子了
let alone my grandson.

356
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,270
你听听他说的
Listen to this guy.

357
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,170
突然间就变成"我儿子""我孙子"
Now, suddenly, it's "my son," "my grandson."

358
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,410
上周你还分不清他
Last week, you didn't know Matthew

359
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,800
-和园丁  -冷静点  小子
- from the fucking gardener. - Take it down a peg, boy-o.

360
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,970
要是骗我们  你就浪费钱了  巴格利先生
You waste your money, Mr. Baggerly, if you lie to us.

361
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:47,900
我没撒谎  我也不会撒谎
I did not lie. I do not lie.

362
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,540
我告诉了你们该知道的信息
I told you what you needed to know.

363
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,900
你告诉我们  他是你教会的成员
You told us he was one of your fellow parishioners in your church,

364
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,790
你没说你赶火车的时候还上了他妈
not that you knocked up his mother in between train whistles.

365
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,700
我听说你是个功勋卓著的军人
And I was told that you were a decorated serviceman.

366
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:04,650
但其实你收到蓝票  被开除军籍
But actually you were discharged with a blue ticket.

367
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,860
蓝票是给那些惹麻烦的军人的
A blue ticket is reserved for undesirable servicemen.

368
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,510
同性恋和黑人
Homosexuals and Negroes.

369
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,380
你不是黑人吧
You're not Negro, are you?

370
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,580
我有四分之一威尔士血统  只碰过一个男人
No, I'm a quarter Welsh and queer only once.

371
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,160
我听说他们叫你
I heard they called you

372
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,080
"蒙福贡的屠夫"
the "Butcher of Montfaucon."

373
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:34,010
被送上了军事法庭
Brought before a military tribunal.

374
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,910
我所闻可还准确  梅森先生
Did I hear wrong, Mr. Mason?

375
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,020
我们都只告诉别人
We tell one another what we need to tell

376
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,600
该说的事  不是吗
one another, do we not?

377
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,060
孩子  你要不
Son, why don't you get--

378
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,100
我再去趟多德森家
I'm gonna double back to the Dodsons'.

379
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,100
会会这个突然想起来
Check out this witness that suddenly remembers

380
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,010
在小巷见过马修的目击证人
seeing Matthew in the alley.

381
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,330
我跟他们的目击者聊了
So I spoke to the guy, their witness,

382
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:09,060
一个基特先生  你认识吗
a Mr. Kitt. You know him?

383
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:12,070
不认识  也说不定
No, I-- Maybe.

384
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,380
就是你马路对面的一个邻居
One of your neighbors just across the way there.

385
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,050
我不怎么跟人交往
I don't socialize much.

386
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,220
没事
No matter.

387
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:25,300
他说看见马修
He said he saw Matthew

388
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,650
在查理被带走时
go down the side of the house

389
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:29,380
走过了房子一侧
when Charlie was taken.

390
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,430
更糟糕的是
Which sounds worse than it is,

391
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,760
基特先生的原话是他看见"一个男人"
'cause Mr. Kitt originally told the police he saw "a man."

392
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,890
在警方第三次威逼下  改口"看见马修"
Turned into "saw Matthew" third time they leaned on him.

393
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:40,380
这是好事吧  他不能确定
I suppose that's good that he wasn't sure.

394
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,630
-你确定不是马修吗  -当然确定
- Are you sure it wasn't Matthew? - Of course I am.

395
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,520
问这些问题是我的工作
It's my job to ask these questions.

396
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,250
我只是在谈可能情景
I'm only talking about what might be possible.

397
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,290
你
You, um...

398
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,350
你听着收音机
you fell asleep in front of the fire...

399
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,270
在炉火前睡着了
listening to the radio.

400
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:10,460
是鲁迪·瓦利  弗莱希曼的酵母时间
It was Rudy Vallee. Fleischmann's Yeast Hour.

401
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,010
我努力一次不落
I try to never miss it.

402
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,740
当鸣鸟歌唱
When songbirds are singing

403
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,780
嗨哟  各位  嗨哟
Heigh-Ho, everybody Heigh-Ho

404
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,780
-你也喜欢鲁迪·瓦利吗  -也不是
- You like Rudy Vallee, too? - Not really.

405
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:24,680
就是那种不管你愿不愿意
Just one of those things that gets in your head,

406
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,430
都会不由自主记住的东西
whether you want them there or not.

407
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,580
你和马修之间怎么样
How are things between you and Matthew?

408
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,030
如果你想胡诌什么故事  梅森先生
If you wanna push stories, Mr. Mason,

409
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,810
出去跟记者站在一起
go on outside and stand with the reporters.

410
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:38,900
站在外面  跟他们那群人一起
Stand out there, and shout at my windows

411
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,210
对着我家窗户大喊大叫
with the rest of them.

412
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,560
马修绝不会伤害查理
Matthew would never... hurt Charlie.

413
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:55,000
艾米莉  带走你儿子的人从来没想伤害他
Emily, whoever took your son never meant to hurt him.

414
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,190
他们只想要钱
They just wanted money.

415
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:02,180
然后事情出了大岔子
And something went horribly wrong.

416
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,730
你要抽烟吗
Can I offer you a cigarette?

417
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,720
我更希望你别在这里抽烟
I'd prefer you not smoke in here,

418
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,380
如果你不介意的话
if it's all the same to you.

419
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,180
当然
Of course.

420
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,610
我们只收留了母的
We only kept the females.

421
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,240
如果是生了一窝的话
I mean, when we were having litters.

422
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,950
我们倒不会赶走公猫
Not that we pushed the toms out, mind you.

423
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,820
我们是正统的天主教徒
We're right Catholics.

424
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:40,510
特罗特拿了一个篮子把公猫淹死了
Mr. Trotter got a bucket and drowned 'em.

425
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:43,070
-这是人道的做法  -当然了
- It's the humane thing to do. - Of course.

426
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,240
自己玩去  赛迪美
Settle yourself, Sadie Mae!

427
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:48,650
查理消失的那天晚上  你看到奇怪的事情了吗
Did you see anything odd the night Charlie disappeared?

428
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,120
没有  抱歉
No. Sorry.

429
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,330
没有陌生人  陌生的车辆
No strangers? No unfamiliar cars?

430
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:55,860
只有在打电话闲聊的太太
Just the missus gabbing away on the phone.

431
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,160
要我说  是她丈夫太过忙于工作了
You ask me, the mister works too much.

432
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,380
可怜的姑娘  一整晚都在打电话
Poor girl talks on the phone all night,

433
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:06,330
只希望能有个人能聊天  有点可悲
just to have someone to talk to. Kinda sad.

434
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,380
你说她那天晚上在打电话
You say she was on the phone that night?

435
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,660
快看  她又在打电话了
Look, she's at it again.

436
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,510
并指导录制我们电台的问候语
And directing the recording of our radio greetings.

437
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,900
嗨哟  各位  嗨哟
Heigh-ho, everybody, heigh-ho!

438
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,400
冲
Go!

439
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:42,130
快点  跟我上
Come on, with me.

440
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,940
求你了  动手吧
Please, do it.

441
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:40,760
求你
Please.

442
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,540
求你动手
Please do it.

443
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:48,420
杀了我  求求你
Kill me. Please do it.

444
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:13,660
鲜花  讣告的内容
Flowers, obituary composition,

445
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:16,610
骨灰盒和墓碑  及碑上的铭文
casket and tombstone, the inscriptions thereon.

446
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:19,510
我们的职责就是负责每一个细节
It is our business to take on every detail

447
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,840
好让你和你丈夫
so that you and your husband...

448
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,820
好让你和你的家人
So that you and your family

449
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,920
可以先整理自己的悲痛
can concentrate on the grieving at hand.

450
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:32,010
我们有很多不同的骨灰盒
Now, we have a variety of caskets.

451
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,300
大多数是用绸缎做里衬
Most are lined in satin,

452
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:37,000
刺绣是来自一流的奥克斯纳德市女裁缝
and the embroidery is first rate from a seamstress in Oxnard.

453
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,820
{\an8}基础款棺椁  奢华款棺椁

454
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,430
这些都不错  这款  这款
Well, any of these. This one. This one.

455
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,850
我想推荐这一款
Ah. Might I suggest this one.

456
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,590
红木外壳  蓝色绸缎里衬
Redwood casing, blue interior satin,

457
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,980
枕头上有金色叶子
gold leaf on the pillowing

458
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,890
-而且这款  -我饿了
- and it's available... - I'm hungry.

459
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,500
只有婴儿大小
...in an infant's sizing.

460
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,800
我自从昨天早上开始就没吃东西了
I haven't eaten since yesterday morning.

461
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,510
拉奇蒙特有一家不错的餐厅
You know, there's a swell diner down on Larchmont.

462
00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:00,290
艾米莉小姐  不如让我来处理这些事宜
Ms. Emily, why don't you let me handle the affairs

463
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,990
让黛拉开我的车送你去吧
and Della can drive you down there in my car.

464
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,090
先生们  谢谢
Gentlemen. Thank you.

465
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,810
-先生们  -怎么了
- Gentlemen? - Yes.

466
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:17,320
-多德森夫人  -多德森夫人
- Mrs. Dodson? - Mrs. Dodson?

467
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,130
多德森夫人
Mrs. Dodson,

468
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,570
你丈夫被捕之后  你跟他谈话过吗
have you talked with your husband since the arrest?

469
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:21,580
你当晚在喝酒吗  你丈夫...
Were you drinking the night your husband--

470
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,500
你认为是你丈夫亲手杀了查理吗
Do you think your husband killed Charlie himself?

471
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,940
多德森夫人  是开棺葬礼
Mrs. Dodson, is it going to be an open casket

472
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,330
还是打算火化呢
or are you cremating the body?

473
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,000
晚上睡得安心吗
Sleep well at night, do ya?

474
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,910
不要挡我的路
Hey. Get out of my way.

475
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:48,900
真是够奇怪的  在这附近发现两具白人尸体
Odd enough, finding two dead white folks around this way.

476
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:52,130
时不时的确能发现死掉的煤炉工  茶水工
I mean, occasionally, you find a stiff coal burner, a tea head,

477
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,570
但大多数时候  都是被人拿刀捅死的
but that's mostly about a knife stuck in them somewhere.

478
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:58,410
子弹  这是处决
Bullets, see, that's-- that's executive murder.

479
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,940
再加上那手提箱
That and the suitcase.

480
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,540
你就把这事跟之前听到的案情联系起来了
And you connected that off the briefings?

481
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,620
是的  长官  还有那帽子和素描
Yes, sir. And the hat. That sketch.

482
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,990
报告里提到了一处血迹
Report here mentions a blood trail.

483
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,690
是的  长官  沿逃生梯通向楼顶
Yes, sir. Up the fire escape to the roof.

484
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,940
然后通向了哪里
Leading to what?

485
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:17,370
-线索断了  -断了
- Nothing. - Nothing?

486
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,740
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

487
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:22,270
可能是你弄错了
Could be you got that wrong.

488
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,300
可能血迹是从屋顶开始  指向楼下
Could be the trail starts on the roof and leads down.

489
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,450
是的  长官  有可能
Yes, sir. Could be.

490
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:37,250
只是  血滴
Ah. Only the, uh, the drops of blood.

491
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:40,130
血溅的尾部指向上楼方向
The tail on the splash points up those stairs.

492
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:47,290
瞧瞧这小子啊
Wow, get a load of this character.

493
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:50,630
德雷克警官是位侦探
Officer Drake here is a detective.

494
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,190
对吗  德雷克警官
Ain't that right, Officer Drake?

495
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,180
你像我和恩尼斯警长一样是侦探吗
You a detective like me and Sergeant Ennis?

496
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,690
不  长官  不是的
No, sir. No.

497
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,830
因为没有黑人侦探
'Cause there are no colored detectives.

498
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,280
可能德雷克警官会成为第一个
Hmm, maybe Officer Drake's gonna be the first.

499
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,970
我个人不赞同这种政策
I personally disagree with the policy.

500
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,860
我小时候就有黑人保姆
Had me a colored mammy as a young-'un.

501
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,090
我也乐意跟黑人警探合作
Just as soon as work with a colored detective as Ennis.

502
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:20,100
但  生活如此嘛
But, uh... such is life.

503
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:24,180
干得不错  德雷克
This is some good work, Drake.

504
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:26,710
真的不错
Real good.

505
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,710
{\an8}莫顿指挥官

506
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,470
你没吃什么东西
You haven't eaten very much.

507
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:57,460
-抱歉  -没事
- Sorry. - No. It's okay.

508
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:01,070
我近来会环顾四周  感觉我忘了什么
I look around lately, thinking I forgot something.

509
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,430
又没人可问
But there's nobody there to ask.

510
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:12,380
EB会处理好一切的
E.B. will take care of everything.

511
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,330
你不用担心
Don't you worry.

512
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:16,030
不用担心
Don't worry.

513
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:19,000
我们刚去给我儿子买了棺材
We just went casket shopping for my son.

514
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:22,970
失陪一下
Excuse me.

515
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,680
-请保持连线  -谢谢你  接线员
- Hold for your connection, please. - Thank you, Operator.

516
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,830
你好  接线员  接线员
Hello, Operator? Operator?

517
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:17,480
我是接线员  请问您要接到哪里
Operator. How may I direct your call?

518
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,020
我妻子刚刚想
Uh, yeah. My wife was just trying to, uh,

519
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:19,910
打给她的医生
reach her doctor

520
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,960
但好像断线了
but, well, it seems she got cut off.

521
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,990
稍等  先生  我重新连线
One moment, sir. I'll try the line again.

522
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,460
非常感谢  女士
Thank you kindly, ma'am.

523
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,010
对不起  先生
I'm sorry, sir.

524
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:30,430
对方似乎无人接听
Your party doesn't seem to be answering.

525
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,450
无人接听吗  这很重要
No answer? Well, this is real important.

526
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,350
是医疗上的事情
It's a medical situation, you see.

527
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,340
对不起  先生
I'm sorry, sir.

528
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,070
你在接哪个号码
Well, what number are you trying?

529
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,240
西拉3-6517
Sierra 3-6517.

530
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,170
老天  那是我们自己的号码
Holy crow, that's our own number.

531
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,070
难怪无人接听  谢谢
No wonder we're not home. Thank you.

532
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:46,200
这里的咖啡不错吧
Great coffee they got here, huh?

533
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,720
你他妈为什么跟着我们
Why the hell are you following us?

534
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,540
EB想确保
Well, E.B. wanted, uh, to make sure,

535
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,350
外面那么多记者
you know, with all the reporters, that--

536
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,290
你真不会撒谎  更不会盯梢
You're a bad liar. And a lousy tail.

537
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:54,990
我没必要向你解释什么  黛拉
I don't have to explain shit to you, Della.

538
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:57,720
我在办案  我在工作
I'm-- I'm-- I'm working the case. I'm doing my job.

539
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:03,510
孩子  我送你回家吧
Hey, kid, let's get you home, okay?

540
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:08,970
我是接线员  请问您要接到哪里

541
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:11,360
博伊尔2-3405
Uh, Boyle 2-3405.

542
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,750
稍等  先生

是的  你有反向搜索簿吗
Yes, I-- I-- Look, do you have the reverse look-up handy?

546
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:24,330
我要找一个名字和地址  西拉3-6517
I need a name and an address. Sierra 3-6517.

547
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:29,300
回来的感觉不错吧
Must feel good. To be back.

548
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,290
你是这里的老成员了
You look quite the stalwart around here.

549
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,530
我不敢这么说
I wouldn't say that.

550
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,960
我看了照片  听说了一些故事
I've seen the pictures, heard some stories.

551
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,570
很多故事
A lot of stories, actually.

552
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,510
可以说是创始会员
Practically an original member.

553
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:44,670
"城里最好的年轻人"之一
One of the "best young men the city contained".

554
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:49,000
那时候这座城很小  至于"最好"
Smaller city back in those days and "best..."

555
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,280
总是相对的
has always been a relative term.

556
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,370
很抱歉让你那么难堪
I'm sorry for, uh, catching you out like that.

557
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,440
这是个大案子  压力很大
It's a big case. Lot of pressure.

558
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,230
我绝无不敬之意
And there was no disrespect intended.

559
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,590
所以我才要求见你
That's why I asked to meet with you.

560
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,630
好  那你就说吧
Okay. So let's hear it already.

561
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,730
多德森签供认书  我就不提绞刑
Dodson signs a confession. I take hanging off the table.

562
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:17,330
我们把杀人归罪到其中一个死人头上
We pin the murder on one of the dead guys.

563
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,060
-干净利落  -我喜欢
- That's tidy. - I like it.

564
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:23,340
市长也喜欢  新闻记者也会喜欢的
Mayor likes it. The Newshawks are gonna love it.

565
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:26,020
你整过我一次  梅纳德  不会有下一次了
You took me once, Maynard. It won't happen again.

566
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,000
我很享受  这不是我常说的话
I relish, and that's not a word I throw around casually,

567
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,310
一想到与你对簿公堂  我就很期待
I truly relish the thought of going into court with you.

568
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:37,400
如果你是巴格利的朋友
If you are Baggerly's friend,

569
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,900
你应该享受救他儿子的机会
you should relish the chance to save his son's life.

570
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,210
马修·多德森是无辜的
Matthew Dodson is innocent.

571
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:45,210
得了吧  我有目击证人  我有
Oh, come on, I have an eyewitness, I have--

572
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,000
我的调查员正在调查
My investigator is currently looking

573
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,650
你掌握的东西是怎样少得可怜
into what little you have.

574
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:51,590
这是能判绞刑的  EB  不是什么白发老太
This is a hanging case, E.B., not some gray-hair

575
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,290
想把她的毛衣留给一只猫
that wants to leave her sweaters to a cat.

576
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:57,790
为你自己着想  考虑一下是否
Do yourself a favor, and consider the possibility

577
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:59,770
你可能无法驾驭这个案子
you may be out of your depth.

578
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,630
你想呆多久都行
Stay as long as you want.

579
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:06,980
再喝一轮吧  记我账上
Have another round. On me.

580
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,590
先生们
Gentlemen.

581
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:25,700
{\an8}当地各界强烈抗议  马修·多德森应该被处绞刑
上帝广播集会将向小成员道别  愿我们永远不会经历他可怜母亲的悲痛

582
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,240
我们安排卡特市长坐哪儿
Where are we putting Mayor Carter?

583
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:28,390
在阳台下面的包厢
On the house right under the balcony lip.

584
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:31,290
不  不  不  那还不够近
Oh, no. No, no, no, no. That's not nearly close enough.

585
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:35,130
我们把他安排在...靠过道的位置
Here, we'll put him on the-- on the aisle.

586
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,780
我记得你安排了
I-- I believe that's where you've sat

587
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:39,220
克拉克·盖博先生坐那儿  麦基根嬷嬷
Mr. Clark Gable, Mother McKeegan.

588
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:42,220
他不是一米八多吗
Well, he's a bread loaf over six feet, isn't he?

589
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,200
他的确是个高个儿  嬷嬷
He is a tall man, yes, Mother.

590
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,200
我们不能让市长为了看清舞台
Well, we can't have the mayor leaning and preening

591
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,580
-歪来倒去  -按说
- trying to see the stage. - You'd have thought

592
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:51,240
如此悲痛的场合会让人避而远之  但是...
grim circumstances would have driven everyone away, but...

593
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:55,050
谁能想到我们会主持这样的活动呢
Well, who knew we were even hosting the event.

594
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,510
但事到如此  我们就要像
But here we are. And we should do this

595
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:00,090
以往一样主持这次活动  精益求精
as we do all things. Best and better.

596
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:03,250
布朗长老
Elder Brown,

597
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,350
布朗太太是否愿意让出她的位置
would Mrs. Brown be willing to part with her seat

598
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,830
让市长能有更清晰地看到台上的活动
to offer the mayor a clear view of the stage?

599
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:15,400
悉听尊便
Whatever accommodates.

600
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:18,770
我会保证在我们离开前往墓地前
I'll make sure she gets a moment with Mr. Gable

601
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:20,660
她会有机会和盖博先生互动
before we part to the cemetery.

602
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:23,500
或许更适合直接在墓地
Perhaps it would be wise to move the event

603
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,260
举办这个活动  考虑到...
directly to the cemetery, considering...

604
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:29,490
考虑到什么
Considering what?

605
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:32,090
要埋葬一位成员的孩子
A member's child is being laid to rest.

606
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:35,310
但...同时他也被起诉谋杀
But... one is also being charged with murder.

607
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:38,720
绑架  不是谋杀
Kidnapping. Not murder.

608
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,660
况且警察在此事上大错特错
And the police are in serious error on that matter.

609
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:46,110
我只是在想这是否对我们教堂来说关注度太高
I merely wonder if this is a light too bright for our church.

610
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:48,330
这不是我儿子干的
My son did not do this.

611
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:51,640
如你我一样  他也是基督的儿子
He's a child of Christ's blood, just like you and me.

612
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:53,410
别因为他身世的罪孽
Do not let the sin of his birth,

613
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:55,290
以及我向你们隐瞒这件丑事
nor the fact that I kept this shame from all of you...

614
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:56,920
而产生偏见
Do not let it blind you.

615
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,570
哀恸的人有福
Blessed are the mourners.

616
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,630
这难道不是你们听过最正确的一句话吗
Isn't that the truest thing you ever heard?

617
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:08,490
嬷嬷  巴格利兄弟  明天我能对此进行演说吗
Mother, Brother Baggerly, can I speak on that tomorrow?

618
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:10,800
听上去不错  修女
That sounds lovely, Sister.

619
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:16,150
我相信这会给出席的所有人带来莫大的安慰
I'm sure that'll bring great comfort to all those in attendance.

620
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,700
{\an8}当地各界强烈抗议  马修·多德森应该被处绞刑

621
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,880
{\an8}正义是否会降临

622
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,460
卖福乐刷子的  来把好用的新刷子吧
Fuller Brush Man. Get a handy new brush

623
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,240
只耽误你两分钟时间
for just two minutes of your time.

624
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,330
外面那是你的车吗
That your car outside?

625
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:31,800
我想问你几个问题
'Cause I'd like to ask you a few questions.

626
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,900
{\an8}我无法承受我们所做的一切  你能在胡佛街79号找到另外两个人  愿主饶恕我这个罪人

627
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:58,340
怎么了
What?

628
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:02,190
工作上的事
It's work.

629
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,370
巡逻指挥官说我犯了一个错误
Watch Commander say I made a mistake.

630
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:11,330
但我没犯错  但他说我犯了  所以...
'Cept I didn't make no mistake. 'Cept he says I did. So.

631
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,600
我得修改我的报告
I had to change my report.

632
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,890
-那个乔·莫顿吗  -是的
- This Joe Morton? - Yeah.

633
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:18,370
你说"乔·莫顿比一袋榔头还蠢"
You say, "Joe Morton dumber than a bag of hammers."

634
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:20,750
那是因为他的确比一袋榔头还蠢
That's 'cause he is dumber than a bag of hammers.

635
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,240
那你为什么要改报告
So why'd you change it?

636
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:25,080
宝贝  你觉得呢
Baby, why do you think?

637
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,960
离我远点  警官
Outta my face, cop.

638
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,670
你要喊德雷克警官  利普女士
That's Officer Drake to you, Ms. Lip.

639
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:13,960
{\an8}"亲爱的乔治  雨季过去了  季节又再次更替  春天来了  暖风轻柔地吹散这个时节从海里的雾气"

640
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:16,250
{\an8}"我别无所求  只有这个"  艾米莉

641
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,700
{\an8}"下次见"  艾米莉

642
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,940
伙计  除非有市警局允许  禁止探视
Hey, pal. No visitors unless it's cleared downtown.

643
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:44,190
我为他们律师工作
Yeah. I work for their attorney.

644
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:45,900
我不管你为谁工作  回你车里
I don't care who you work for, you get back in the truck.

645
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:46,950
快停下
Hey, stop right there.

646
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:48,100
多德森太太
Mrs. Dodson?

647
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,200
-艾米莉  -感觉到了吗
- Emily? - Hey, you feel that?

648
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,450
-我会...  -梅森先生
- I will... - Mr. Mason?

649
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:53,390
看到了吗  她认识我
See? She knows me.

650
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,620
-怎么回事  -安静点
- What's going on? - Be quiet.

651
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:56,650
你弄疼我了
You're hurting me.

652
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,320
谁是乔治·甘农
Who's George Gannon?

653
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,210
-乔治  甘农  -谁是乔治·甘农
- George... Gannon? - Who's George Gannon?

654
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,530
-我不认识任何叫...  -别  别  别
- I don't know anyone named-- - Don't, don't, don't...

655
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,970
-别这么做  -他是一个教堂的朋友
- Don't do it. - He's a friend from church.

656
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:12,470
不要  不要对我撒谎 
Do not-- Do not lie to me, do not lie to me.

657
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:13,500
谁是乔治
Who's George?

658
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,690
我俊美的乔治
"My beautiful George,

659
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:20,400
距离我们上次见面才过去三天
It's been three days since we saw each other,

660
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,810
但感觉就像过去了三年
but it feels more like three years..."

661
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:22,820
他是教堂那边的朋友
He's a friend from church.

662
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:24,780
带我走  乔治  去海里的某座岛屿
"Take me away, George. To some island in the ocean.

663
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,490
烧掉带我们到那里的小船
And set fire to the boat that got us there..."

664
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:28,560
那些信不是你的
Those aren't yours.

665
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,280
上帝一定希望我们在一起
"God must want us to be together,

666
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,370
不然我们不会有这样的感受
or we wouldn't be feeling this way.

667
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:36,770
我爱你胜过所有人  艾米莉
I love no one more than you, Emily."

668
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:43,860
-乔治在哪儿  -乔治已经死了
- Where's George? - George is dead.

669
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,660
不
No.

670
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,080
不
No!

671
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,700
不  她在说谎
No, she's lying!

672
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:21,290
我给过她全盘招供的机会  她犹豫了
I gave her a chance to come clean, she dithered.

673
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:22,880
现在她还让她丈夫为此上绞架
Now, she's letting her husband swing for it.

674
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,210
你从犯罪现场取证
Hey, you took evidence from a crime scene!

675
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:26,500
你可能会因此丢掉执照
You could lose your license for this!

676
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:28,170
他们不需要知道我是从哪儿找到这些的
They don't have to know where we got them.

677
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:29,300
这能让我们的委托人免罪
It gets our client off.

678
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,800
但却让另一位委托人上绞架
And gets another client the rope.

679
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,080
你到底接不接电话
Are you gonna answer that?

680
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:37,430
委托人是赫尔曼·巴格利  他掏了大钱
The client is Herman Baggerly, who's out a hundred thou,

681
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:40,180
他的妻子和合法的孩子都会因此蒙羞
whose wife and legitimate kids are gonna get humiliated.

682
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:42,100
没错  老子撒谎  儿子犯浑
Yes. A lying dad, with a bastard son,

683
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,460
儿媳出轨
and a daughter-in-law who's a goddamn cheat.

684
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,610
-圣三一  -你闭嘴
- The holy trinity. - You shut up.

685
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,190
-他就是个废物  -我说的吧
- He's a degenerate. - See?

686
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:49,150
他连词都用的跟我一样
He even used the word!

687
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:51,600
不  别闭嘴  跟他说说你查到了什么
No. Don't shut up. Tell him what you got.

688
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:53,820
我找到了两个自称晚上曾跟多德森一起
I tracked down two chinks say they were in that dice joint

689
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:55,060
赌博的中国佬
with Dodson on the night.

690
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:57,660
我让你去查马修的不在场证明
I told you to check out Matthew's alibi.

691
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,750
他光跟踪艾米莉和我就够忙的了
He was too busy following Emily and me.

692
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:00,790
对  还好我那么做了
Yeah. Good thing I did.

693
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:02,620
她跟查理的凶案没关系
She had nothing to do with Charlie's murder.

694
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:04,130
但看这些信可不是那样
Well, these letters say different.

695
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:07,210
这些信说明她出轨了  那又怎样
These letters say she had an affair. So what?

696
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:08,590
你又没有全天跟她待在一起
You didn't spend the day with her.

697
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:10,970
那女人心碎了  我有直觉  老板
The woman is broken. I got a feeling, Chief.

698
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:12,090
维斯塔路有个
There's a guy on Vista Drive

699
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:13,550
脑袋已经失去了知觉的男人
with no feeling in his fucking head...

700
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:15,300
而小查理就要在哈特-汉娜那里
and Little Charlie is about to get embalmed over

701
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,180
接受防腐处理了  所以不要跟我谈直觉
at Harte and Hanna. So, spare me the intuition.

702
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:18,970
我是花钱雇你接电话的吗
Do I pay you to answer the phone?

703
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:20,580
没错  是的
Yes, I do.

704
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:25,780
这里是EB·乔纳森的办公室
E.B. Jonathan's office.

705
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:27,050
请问有什么需要帮忙的
How can I help you?

706
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:32,490
警察猜对一半  是出了大岔子的勒索
Cops got it half right, it's extortion gone way wrong.

707
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:34,240
但凶手不是马修  是艾米莉
But it's not Matthew. It's Emily

708
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,700
和这个乔治  还有他找来的黑帮
and this guy George and the hoods he got in with.

709
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,200
警察教了邻居提供什么口供
The cops coached the neighbor's statement.

710
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,230
那晚他在巷子里看到的人是乔治·甘农
It was George Gannon he saw in the alley that night.

711
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:41,950
你不是说
I thought you said

712
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,900
乔治当时在打电话  分散她注意
George was on the phone, distracting her.

713
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,280
对  是的
Yeah. He-- he was.

714
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,300
-他怎么能同时做到两件事  -我也不知道
- How could he manage both? - I don't know!

715
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,090
也许那是中央大道的其中一个死人
Maybe he's one of the stiffs of Central Ave!

716
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:54,590
你在胡扯呢吧  小子
Pulling this outta your ass, boy-o...

717
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:56,080
这我同意
Oh, that I agree with.

718
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:59,890
还有你  在接电话的时候要说
And you, it's "E.B. Jonathan and Associates"

719
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:00,720
"EB·乔纳森和合伙人"
when you answer the phone!

720
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,980
已经有六年没人跟你合伙了
Haven't been associates for six years!

721
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,390
你们之间有些事需要处理
You people got some things to sort out.

722
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:06,920
我不会给妓院报销
I don't reimburse for whorehouses.

723
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:13,300
怎么了  我跟踪那人  总得融入进去
What? I was tailing a guy. I had to blend in!

724
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:15,470
融入...
Blend in...

725
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:18,180
听着  乔治家完全不对劲
Look, George's place was all wrong.

726
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,620
伪造的自杀遗书  我杀了我的同伙
A trumped-up suicide note? I kill my partners,

727
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:22,240
烧了钱  然后把自己脑袋一枪崩了
I burned the money, I blow my head off,

728
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:24,620
因为我好命苦  我很内疚吗
'cause woe is me, I have a guilty conscience?

729
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:26,460
你知道还有谁会内疚吗
You know who else has a guilty conscience?

730
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,920
帕西·杜蒙特  久经世故的卓越男人
Percy DuMott, sophisticated man of distinction!

731
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,540
你他妈的能闭嘴吗
Would you shut the fuck up?

732
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:31,340
你真让我头疼  小子
You're giving me migraines, son.

733
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,710
我要怎么把这纳入证据
How am I supposed to even introduce these?

734
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:34,550
我怎么拿到的
How do I get 'em?

735
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:36,590
这对马修来说就是合理怀疑
This is reasonable doubt for Matthew.

736
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:38,470
不忠不等于谋杀
Infidelity is not murder.

737
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:41,330
听着  咱们得看看手头掌握的情况
Look, we gotta look at what we got.

738
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:44,500
马修是个赌鬼  艾米莉出轨
Matthew's a gambler. Emily's a cheat.

739
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,440
你们有谁认为他们杀了自己的孩子吗
Either of you think they killed their kid?

740
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,630
-不  -我不知道
- No. - No. I don't know.

741
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:49,630
不是故意的吧
Not intentionally.

742
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:54,110
你是不是没法把这些
I don't suppose you could put these back

743
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:55,220
放回原处了
where you found them?

744
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:57,700
你让我报警了
You had me call it in.

745
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,640
警察应该已经到了
Cops are probably crawling already.

746
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:02,350
信留在这
The letters stay here.

747
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:05,620
等我想到最佳用法再说
We sit on them until I figure the best way to use them.

748
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:08,020
都听到了吗  等我想出办法的
Everyone hear that? Until I figure.

749
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,820
总得有人做领头羊  那就是我
Someone has to lead, and that's me.

750
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:17,450
我们得再买些电话
We're gonna need more phones.

751
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:19,830
要么就找代接服务
Or an answering service.

752
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:27,920
EB·乔纳森和合伙人
E.B. Jonathan and Associates.

753
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,820
乔纳森先生正在开会
Mr. Jonathan is in a meeting at the moment.

754
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:34,090
我可以转述给他
I can take a message.

755
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:03,710
大家准备好了
We're ready.

756
00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:01,850
"哀恸的人有福了  因为他们必得安慰"
"Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted."

757
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:04,680
阿门  赞美吧
Amen! Praise be!

758
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:07,410
这是我们的主耶稣基督
The words of Jesus Christ Our Lord,

759
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:09,400
在山上布道时的话语
from His Sermon on the Mount.

760
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:13,530
《圣经》的这段话还有另外一个名字
There's another name for that part of the good book,

761
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:16,780
八福
The Beatitudes.

762
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:20,870
它是如此美妙的想法
And it is a beautiful thought.

763
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,910
"哀恸的人有福了  因为他们必得安慰"
"Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted."

764
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:27,710
阿门
Amen!

765
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:37,510
可艾米莉·多德森如何能得到安慰
But how will Emily Dodson be comforted?

766
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:48,480
这位光荣的母亲  孕育了孩子
This glorious mother, who birthed the child,

767
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:51,020
为孩子沐浴
who bathed the child,

768
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,540
将身体中的养分给与孩子
who fed the child from her body,

769
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:56,210
兄弟姐妹们  我们应该怎么做
how do we, Brothers and Sisters,

770
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:58,240
才能给她慰藉
provide comfort for her...

771
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:02,090
当那个孩子  查理·多德森
When the child, Charlie Dodson,

772
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:05,660
就躺在你在我面前看到的这个盒子里
lies in this very box you see before me?

773
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:10,710
我不清楚我们是否能做到
I don't know if we can.

774
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:17,340
不要误会我的意思  艾米莉
Do not misunderstand me, Emily.

775
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:20,190
你的人生不会再有
You will not know another friendless day

776
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:21,720
没有朋友的日子
for the rest of your life,

777
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:24,950
上帝作证
and God as my witness,

778
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:29,160
若我们辜负了你  拿让这座教堂
may this Temple crumble to its very foundations

779
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,620
倒塌到它的根基上 
if we fail you.

780
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:33,730
没错  阿门
Yeah! Amen!

781
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:39,860
我面前有许多新面孔
I see new faces down in the front.

782
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:43,530
男人们
Men.

783
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:48,160
我们城市里最有权力的人们
The most powerful men in our city.

784
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:52,710
他们得到了我们慈爱之家最好的座位
Given the best seats in our loving home.

785
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:03,730
就像我不能确定我们是否能为
And just as I can't be sure that we can offer comfort

786
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,470
这位哀伤的母亲能提供安慰
to the mother in mourning,

787
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:09,810
我也不能确定我是否会再次见到你们
I can't be sure I'll ever see you men under our roof again.

788
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:14,850
所以让我直接对你们说话
So let me address you directly.

789
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:28,930
魔鬼将查理·多德森放入这个盒子中
The Devil put Charlie Dodson in this box.

790
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:29,590
没错
Yes!

791
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:32,010
他从地狱一跃而起
He flew up from hell,

792
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:33,850
大步走上街道
walked to our streets,

793
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:38,390
将暴虐的手放在了孩子的头上
and laid his violent hand on this child's head.

794
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:45,390
未来的日子也有八福
Beatitudes for the day at hand.

795
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:48,720
上帝保佑警察
Blessed be the police

796
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:51,890
警察收集证据对抗这个魔鬼
who will gather evidence against the Devil.

797
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:52,910
对
Yes!

798
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:54,990
上帝保佑律师
Blessed be the attorneys

799
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,790
律师会控告这个魔鬼
who will prosecute the Devil.

800
00:52:57,790 --> 00:52:58,750
阿门
Amen!

801
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:02,880
上帝保佑陪审团  他们将给魔鬼定罪
Blessed be the jury who will convict the Devil.

802
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:07,720
上帝保佑法官  他会给魔鬼审判
Blessed be the judge who will sentence the Devil.

803
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:08,470
对
Yes!

804
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:13,680
上帝保佑侩子手  他将拧断魔鬼的脖子
Blessed be the hangman who will snap this Devil's neck.

805
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,350
上帝保佑掘墓人
Blessed be the gravediggers

806
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:19,600
将魔鬼埋葬  永世不得超生
who will bury the Devila thousand feet deep,

807
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:24,570
上帝保佑虫子  啖其肉  饮其血
and blessed be the worms who will eat this Devil's flesh

808
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:26,980
魔鬼从此灰飞烟灭
and disappear it from the earth.

809
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,870
这就是主的功勋
This is the work of the Lord.

810
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:37,900
这是为了小查理·多德森
You do this work for little Charlie Dodson.

811
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:05,860
*上帝在光明中*
*God Only Wise*

812
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:11,650
*永生的神*
*In light inaccessible*

813
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:15,830
*凡人却见不到*
*Hid from our eyes*

814
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:17,580
*天佑...*
*Most blessed...*

815
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:19,980
刚刚是在搞什么
What was that?

816
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:30,760
*全知全能的*
*Almighty, victorious*

817
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:36,080
*爱和美*
*Of goodness and love*

818
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:40,640
*赋予你的每个子民*
*To all life Thou givest*

819
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:45,440
*赋予伟大和渺小*
*To both great and small*

820
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:50,070
*赋予你的每个生命*
*In all life Thou livest*

821
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:54,860
*真谛的意义*
*The true life of all*

822
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:59,450
*我们像繁茂的树叶*
*We blossom and flourish*

823
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:04,120
*盛开在世界上*
*As leaves on the tree*

824
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:08,750
*到了冬天便会消亡*
*And wither and perish*

825
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:12,840
*但是却改变不了你*
*But naught changeth Thee*

826
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:15,120
让一下  警官  放开...
Excuse me, officers. Let go of...

827
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:18,180
艾米莉·多德森  你因涉嫌
Emily Dodson, you're under arrest

828
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:20,180
阴谋绑架查理·多德森而被捕了
for the conspiracy kidnapping of Charlie Dodson.

829
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:21,520
-不  -请跟我来  女士
- No. - Come with us, ma'am.

830
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,810
不  放开她
No. Let go of her!

831
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:24,560
-不不不  -放开她
- No. No. No. - Get your hands off her.

832
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,630
救我  救我  救我
Help me! Help me! Help me!

833
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:28,420
查理
Charlie!

834
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,340
不  求求你们不要
Please. Please don't do this!

835
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,800
求求你们不要
Please don't do this!

836
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:34,600
-查理  -回来
- Charlie! - Get back.

837
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,190
查理
Charlie!

838
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:59,600
查理  不要这样
Charlie! Please don't do this.

839
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:01,750
求你们了
Please.

840
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,460
查理
Charlie!

841
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:08,300
求你们不要  不要
Please, don't do this! Please, don't!

842
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,180
我的宝贝
My baby.

843
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,280
{\an8}你在上帝身边
你是被救赎的

844
00:56:34,050 --> 00:56:39,090
{\an8}红顶
安全火柴

845
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:46,080
一杯咖啡
One coffee,

846
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:49,550
一杯冷茶
one cold tea.

847
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,690
那是正确的决定  孩子  相信我
It was the right call, son. Believe me.

848
00:56:54,690 --> 00:56:57,570
明天午餐之前就能让马修出来
We'll get Matthew out before lunchtime tomorrow.

849
00:56:57,570 --> 00:57:00,140
巴格利能高兴  我们也能继续战斗
Baggerly stays happy. We stay in the fight.

850
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:03,060
不忠不是谋杀...
Infidelity is not murder...

851
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:04,640
什么
How's that?

852
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:08,820
我还在想黛拉说的这句话
It's what Della said. It's still in my head.

853
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:11,710
他们已经抓错了人
They already arrested the wrong guy.

854
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:14,670
现在他们觉得一个教堂唱诗班的主妇
Now they're stuck with a church choir housewife

855
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:17,990
是密尔沃基绑架集团主使吗
part of a kidnapping ring out of Milwaukee?

856
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:21,040
就算真是她干的  也别想能说服人
Can't see that holding, even if she did do it.

857
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:28,500
他觉得我已经是他的囊中之物了
He thinks I'm last night's eggs.

858
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:32,960
他觉得他胜券在握了  你瞧好了
Thinks he's playing me. You watch.

859
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:35,430
我们能轻松地把他扳倒
We're gonna run him over like a streetcar.

860
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,600
他们应该等她看到孩子下葬后再抓她
They shoulda let her see the kid get buried.

861
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:41,030
他们原本是这么说的
Oh, they said they would.

862
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:43,180
但现在谁说的话还能信呢
But who tells the truth anymore?

863
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:49,900
我不喜欢这样
I don't like it here.

864
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:55,170
我们总要为更伟大的事业
We do what we don't like

865
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:57,490
做我们不喜欢做的事
when there's a greater good to be served.

866
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:00,370
你应该最清楚这一点
You more than anyone should know that.

867
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:06,660
你知道这座城市里有多少种不同的线吗
You know how many different types of thread there are in the city?

868
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:08,750
你会查清楚的  小子
You'll find it, boy-o.

869
00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:10,500
这不就是你最擅长的事吗
That's the kind of thing you're good at.

870
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:31,390
{\an8}职介所

871
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:43,530
*来看看这个人*
*Come and see a man*

872
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,450
*诉说着我做过的一切*

877

878
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:05,070
*只要你不管去哪里*

879
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:07,280

*Everywhere that you go*

880
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:11,180
*人们都会敬仰他*
*He will draw men unto Him*

881
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:39,420
毒气  毒气
Gas! Gas! Gas! Gas!

882
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:14,120
回我们那边去
Get back to our side!

883
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:19,250
你在干什么  快点
What the fuck are you doing? Now!

884
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:30,640
-上尉  -原谅我
- Captain... - Forgive me.

885
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,810
*只有上帝的恩赐*
*...Only knew the gift of God*

886
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:41,270
*我来接受人们的敬仰*

887
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:45,290
*将他送上圣坛*
*Oh lift Him up, that is all*

888
