They grabbed us from all over,

269
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,670

and they brought us here to kill us,

270
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,410
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}现在他们还在追杀我们
and they're still trying to kill us.

271

{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我在一个加油站
I-I am at a gas station!

275
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,250

Could you please just trace the call?

276

Son, would you mind putting your gun away?

{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你看起来有点激动
You seem a little worked up,

287
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:34,040
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}小心别擦枪走火
and you don't want it to go off by accident.

288
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,590
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}不会走火的  我有七把枪
It's not gonna go off on accident. I own seven guns.

00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,170
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}为什么你有七把枪
Wh-Wh-Why do you own seven guns?

291
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,550

294
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,310
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}正如现在这样
which is exactly what's happening right now.

295
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,250
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}可以吗
Is that okay?

296
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:51,750
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}这么说  那些朝你开枪的人
So, those people that are shooting at you,

297
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,920
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}他们也只是在行使同样的权利吗
they're just exercising the very same right?

298
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,280
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你在说什么呢
What the fuck are you talking about?

00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,700
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}拿点水来
Get some water, dude.

312
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,990
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我觉得她中毒了
I think she's dianetic.

313
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,200

I'm not cleaning him up.

317
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,990
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你们会下地狱的
You're going to hell.

318
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,950
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我不信地狱
I don't believe in hell.

319

As you so eloquently posted,

{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我要说一句  混蛋

{\fnKaiTi\fs12}他是个坏人
He's a monster.

333
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,110
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}亲爱的  他可能辱骂了黑人
Honey, he probably uses the "N" word.

334
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:44,340
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}甚至都不是私下里  他可能在推特上骂了黑人
And not even in private. He probably uses it on Twitter.

335
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,360
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}那些人在这个混蛋的祖先手下
Those people suffered 400 years of bondage

Honey, it's... Privilege, Julius.

00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,650
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}现在再叫他们"黑人"完全没问题
It's perfectly fine to call them "black" again.

Stuck him full of arrows and then blew him to pieces.

355

It was brutal. Anyway...

{\fnKaiTi\fs12}美国人
American.

492
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:51,630
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}-美国人  -对  没错
- American? - Yeah. Yeah.

493
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:52,510
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}她也是
Her, too.

494
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,940
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我给你解释一下  先生
Look, let me explain everything, sir,

495
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:57,890
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我很清楚这是怎么回事
'cause I know exactly what's going on here, okay?

496
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:00,360
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}这些不是真的难民
These are not real refugees.

497
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,470
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}而是危机演员
These are crisis actors.

498
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,120
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}听着  我有个播客
Look, I have a podcast.

499
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,580
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我多次揭穿过这种人
I've been exposing these people, okay?

500
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:11,370
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}他们会被安排到庄园之门的火车上
They were placed on the train as a part of Manorgate.

501
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:15,900
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}这一切都是精心设置的陷阱  引我们上钩
This has all been an elaborate trap to try to ensnare us.

502
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,460
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}他们似乎不信你  加里
I don't think they believe you, Gary.

503
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,970
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你听见他说英语了吗
Did you hear him?

504
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:43,490
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}扯淡
Bullshit.

505
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:45,370
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}这都是鬼扯
This is... That-that's bullshit.

506
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:46,580
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你们都是假扮的
You're all fake!

507
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,600
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}都是假扮的
You're all fake!

508
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,710
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}加里  你得冷静点  知道吗
Gary, you have just got to chill, okay, buddy?

509
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:57,210
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}其他难民不是安排好的
Now, those other refugees, they weren't part of this.

510
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:00,010
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}他们都是真的  我知道  因为我混进了他们之中
They're real. I know. I have been embedded with them, okay?

511
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:01,920
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}那些士兵也是货真价实的
And those soldiers, well, they're fucking real, too.

512
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,590
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}火车本来不该停下的
That train wasn't supposed to be stopped.

513
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:06,640
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}所以你给我镇定一点
So just calm the fuck down,

514
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,600
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我们会挺过去的  知道吗
and we will get through this, all right?

515
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,580
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}还有
And you know what?

516
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,890
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我甚至会让你们先出发
I'll even give you guys a head start

517
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,630
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}然后我才来追你们  怎么样
before I come after you. How's that sound?

518
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,170
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}好不好
You good?

519
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,460
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}说嘛  哥们
Come on, buddy.

520
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,480
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}加里  加里  不要
Gary, Gary, Gary, don't.

521
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:22,430
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我不是你哥们
I am not your buddy!

522
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,620
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}再见了  混蛋[奶嘴]
Sayonara, sugar tits.

523
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,870
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}不不不  不要
No, no, no, no, no, no.

524
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,320
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}操  该死  该死
Fuck. Shit, shit,

525
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,340
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}该死  该死  该死  该死
shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

526
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,490
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}该死  该死
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

527
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,180
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}该死  该死  该死  该死
Fuck. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

528
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,830
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}该死  该死  该死  该死
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

529
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,850
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我叫迪诺  他是博扬
I'm Dino, and this Bojan.

530
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:57,520
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你有证件吗
You have papers?

531
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,530
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}这是什么地方
Where are we?

532
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,490
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你觉得呢
Where you think?

533
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,240
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}这个...
Well...

534
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:07,740
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我之前正在密西西比州吃饭
I was, uh, eating in Mississippi

535
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:11,410
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}然后被人击晕
when I got knocked out

536
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:14,850
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}至少晕过去18小时
for what was at least 18 hours.

537
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:17,790
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}所以考虑到以上几点
So, taking that kind of into account,

538
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,610
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}加上你的口音和我之前看见的一个车牌
along with your accent and a license plate I fucking saw,

539
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:25,970
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我猜我应该是在...
I'm guessing I'm probably in...

540
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,060
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}波斯尼亚
Bosnia.

541
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:32,430
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}塞尔维亚
Serbia?

542
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:34,440
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}克罗地亚
Croatia?

543
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,730
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}那我就是在克罗地亚了
I'm in Croa... Croatia, then.

544
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,410
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}-你怎么来到这里的  -这不重要
- How you get here? - Doesn't matter.

545
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,150
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你得联系美国大使馆
You need to call the American embassy.

546
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,170
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}出示你的证件
Show us paper.

547
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:45,200
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我没有证件
I don't have papers.

548
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,160
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你能打电话给大使馆吗
C-Can you call the embassy?

549
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,740
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你被人狩猎吗
You are hunted?

550
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:54,890
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}谁说我被狩猎
Who said I was hunted?

551
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:55,620
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}唐
Don.

552
00:40:58,350 --> 00:40:59,980
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你和唐一样被狩猎吗
You hunted like Don?

553
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,340
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}谁他妈是唐
Who the fuck is Don?

554
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:06,720
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}带唐过来
Bring Don.

555
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:21,370
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}能给我抽一根吗
Can I have one of those?

556
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:22,230
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}不行
No.

557
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,910
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}唐
Don.

558
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:30,030
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你好
Howdy.

559
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,890
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}没错  像唐一样被狩猎
Yeah, hunted like Don.

560
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:37,410
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我早说过了  混蛋
Yeah. I told you, assholes.

561
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,960
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}那些狗追我时我正往北走
Yeah, I was heading north when the dogs came after me.

562
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:45,420
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}老天  我还以为我死定了
Man, I thought I was fucking dead.

563
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:48,260
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我本来以为是那些庄园之门的混蛋
You know, that it was those Manorgate assholes.

564
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:51,110
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}原来是俄罗斯人
Man, I was... I was relieved

565
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:53,760
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我真的松了口气
when it was just the fucking Russians, you know.

566
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:56,020
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}再多点  再多点
Uh, little more, little more, pal.

567
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,520
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}还有  那个箱子是怎么回事
You know, a-and what was up with that crate?

568
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,960
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}他们为什么要先给我们武器
I mean, why-why did they give us weapons

569
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,960
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}再开始逐个解决我们
before they started picking us off?

570
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,570
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}是为了更公平吗
To make it more fair?

571
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,590
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}还有那头猪是怎么回事
And what was up with that pig?

572
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,620
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}他们不是全都是素食者吗
I thought they were all vegans.

573
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,040
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我等不及要揭露这件事了
Well, I cannot wait to... to blow the lid off this shit.

574
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,460
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}因为我们会上《汉尼提直播秀》的
'Cause we gonna be on Hannity,you and me,

575
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:23,540
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}就像那两个害惨尼克松的犹太小子一样
just like them two Jew boys that fucked Nixon up.

576
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:28,130
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你想告诉我你在想什么吗  亲爱的
You want to share what you're thinking, sweetie?

577
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,010
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}说吧
Come on.

578
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,990
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你不在乎他们为何这样对待我们吗
You don't care why they're doing this to us?

579
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:36,430
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}他们想杀我  我不在乎为什么
Well, they're trying to kill me.I don't give a shit why.

580
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,290
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}那不是山姆大叔的侄子吗
Well, if it ain't Uncle Sam's nephew.

581
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,960
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我们得救了
We're rescued.

582
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:37,410
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}所以你意思是他们在这里
So you're telling me that they built

583
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:39,180
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}建了一整个加油站
an entire gas station out here

584
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:41,660
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}就为了让你们相信这里是阿肯色州中部吗
just to convince you this was the middle of Arkansas?

585
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,980
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}多扭曲的人才会想出这种事啊
What kind of sick individual even comes up with that?

586
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:45,680
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}太可怕了
It's horrifying.

587
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,270
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你说对了  小子
You fucking said it, junior.

588
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:48,690
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}好  我们先回大使馆
Okay, we're gonna get back to the embassy.

589
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:50,190
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我会联系国务院
I'm gonna contact the State Department.

590
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:52,220
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}他们会给我们提供军事援助
We're gonna get military support out here.

591
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,610
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我们会找到这些畜生的
We're gonna find these animals.

592
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:54,590
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}好样的
Attaboy.

593
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,280
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}他们为什么会做这种事
Why would they do something like that?

594
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,200
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}精英做任何事都出于同个原因
Same reason elites do anything--

595
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,220
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}他们认为自己高人一等
'cause they think they're better than us.

596
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,370
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}对  但为什么是你们
Yeah, but... but why you?

597
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:06,190
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}似乎是针对你们  不是吗
I mean, it seems so personal, right?

598
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,770
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}什么
What?

599
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,170
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}不  我意思是  我就是想问
No, no, I mean, I'm... I-I'm just asking,

600
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:12,090
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}为什么偏偏选中你们
why pick you of all people?

601
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:14,670
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你们一定做了什么  引起了他们的注意
You must have done something to pop up on their radar somehow.

602
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:17,510
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}否则  为什么特别把你们当成目标
Otherwise, why target you so specifically?

603
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:20,450
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}-我们什么也没做  -好吧
- We didn't do shit. - Okay.

604
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:23,260
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}-怎么  难道你认为是我们的错吗  -不
- So, wh-what, you think this is our fucking fault? - N-no.

605
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,790
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}不是的  我不是这意思
No, no, that's not what I'm...

606
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:27,380
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}-不  我绝不会责怪受害者  -嗯
- No, I would never blame the victim. - Yeah.

607
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,250
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我只是觉得肯定有某个原因
There'd have to be a reason, is all.

608
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:32,510
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你能想到是什么原因吗
Can you think of anything--

609
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,650
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}任何原因  不管多小
anything at all, no matter how minor--

610
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:37,620
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}可能会导致某人想做这种...
that might make somebody want to try something as...

611
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,770
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}天啊  天啊  天啊
Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

612
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:45,580
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}什么  不
What? No.

613
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,480
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}不  天啊
No! Oh, my God!

614
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:50,480
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}停车  停车
Stop the car! Stop the car!

615
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:52,530
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}不  不
No! No!

616
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,280
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}天啊
Oh, my God!

617
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:58,570
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你疯了吗  女人
Are you out of your mind, woman?!

618
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,050
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}不  你为什么要这么做
No, no, no. Why did you do that?

619
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:02,970
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}不  你为什么这么做
Oh, no. Why did you do that?

620
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:05,290
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}天啊  天啊  他死了吗
Oh, God. Oh, God. Is he dead?

621
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:07,390
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你有什么毛病啊
You, what is wrong with you?

622
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:09,750
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你有什么毛病啊  你这人不正常
What is wrong with you? You are not right.

623
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:10,880
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}天啊
Oh, my God.

624
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,340
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}搞...
What the...

625
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,770
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}操
Oh, fuck.

626
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,610
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你为什么要那么做
Why did you do that? Why...

627
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:19,970
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}他想救我们啊  他...
He was trying to save us. He was...

628
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:23,890
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}上帝啊
Jesus.

629
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,020
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}不  那是加里
Nope, that's Gary.

630
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:29,940
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你怎么知道他在说谎
How'd you know he was lying?

631
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,690
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}因为所有人都在说谎
Because everyone is lying.

632
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,990
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}也许
Well, maybe...

633
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,250
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}也许你该等等再杀他
maybe you should've waited to kill him until...

634
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:40,160
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}让他先告诉我们  他们为何这么做
till he told us why they're doing this.

635
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:43,290
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我很肯定他希望我们能自己告诉他
Pretty sure he wanted us to tell him.

636
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:47,640
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}好吧  我们刚醒来时有11个人
Right, there was 11 of us when we first woke up.

637
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,710
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}出大门后死了四个
There was four down out of the gate.

638
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:51,500
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}有一个人被炸死了
A guy got grenaded.

639
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:54,920
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你说加油站那里有三个人
Uh, you said there were three at the gas station.

640
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:59,760
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我猜和你一起跳上火车的就是这个人
And I assume this is the guy you hopped a train with.

641
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:04,970
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}那就只剩下你和我了
That just leaves you and me.

642
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:07,640
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}没错
Yeah.

643
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,600
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}那是什么
Wh-Wh-What is that?

644
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:14,110
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}是鬼扯先生要带我们去的地方
It's where Mr. Bullshit was taking us.

645
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,320
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}感觉有点太刻意了
This seems a little obvious, like...

646
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:22,370
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}就像他们故意想让我们找到似的
like maybe they wanted us to find it.

647
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,680
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}这要看他们是扮蠢的聪明人
Depends on whether they're smart pretending to be idiots,

648
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,550
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}还是扮聪明的笨蛋
or idiots pretending to be smart.

649
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,890
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}要我说  别管那些混蛋了
Well, I say fuck those fuckers, okay?

650
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:32,640
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我们有车了  直接开走吧
We got us a car. Let's just fucking go.

651
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,750
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}好吗  我来开  给我钥匙
Okay? And I'm driving. Give me the key.

652
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:35,800
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}不
No.

653
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:41,760
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}"不"
"No"?

654
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,060
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}不
No.

655
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:55,860
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我妈以前常跟我讲一个故事
My mama used to tell me this story

656
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,030
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}关于一只兔子和一只乌龟
about the jackrabbit and the box turtle.

657
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:03,490
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}那只兔子是个混蛋
The jackrabbit is a real dick,

658
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:06,450
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}因为他总吹嘘自己
'cause he brags all the time.

659
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,120
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}说没人跑得比他快
Says nobody's faster than him.

660
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,170
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}那是真的
And, well, it's true.

661
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:17,000
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}因为兔子每次比赛都是赢家
'Cause every time he races, the jackrabbit always wins.

662
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:19,940
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}森林里所有动物都得忍受他
The whole fucking forest has to put up with his shit--

663
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,070
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}日复一日
day in, day out.

664
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:23,610
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}那混蛋总想参加比赛  就为了强调自己的地位
Fucker always wants to race just to rub it in some more.

665
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:27,180
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}于是乌龟想着  "有何不可
So the box turtle figures, "Why not?

666
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:29,060
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我尽管去试试"
I'll give it a try."

667
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:31,080
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}兔子笑着说
And the jackrabbit, like, laughs.

668
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,700
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}"好啊  会很有意思的  我们就来比一场"
Like, "Okay, this'll be fun. So let-let's fucking go."

669
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:37,290
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}比赛开始  兔子瞬间冲出去  不见兔影
So bang! Jackrabbit leaves the box turtle in his fucking dust.

670
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:39,420
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}他把乌龟远远甩在后面
I mean, he is way out in front.

671
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,670
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}这是当然了  因为兔子永远是赢家
Of course he is, 'cause jackrabbit always wins.

672
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:45,090
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}但他想增加戏剧性  让战况看起来更激烈
But he wants to put on a show and he'll make it seem close.

673
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:47,700
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}于是他停下来  打了个盹
So he stops, and he takes a nap.

674
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:57,460
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}但他没想到自己睡了那么久
He sleeps longer than he wanted to.

675
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,130
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}等他终于醒来后
By the time he wakes up, the...

676
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:05,470
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}他知道自己完蛋了
I mean, he knows he's fucked.

677
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:08,320
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}兔子全速追赶  但为时已晚
Jackrabbit... goes full tilt, but it's too late.

678
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,740
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}乌龟率先冲过了终点线
The box turtle crosses the finish line first,

679
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,100
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}观众全部...
and the crowd's like...

680
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:16,020
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}激动欢呼
Goes fucking wild.

681
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:21,990
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}到了晚上  乌龟和他家人吃饭时
Later that night, box turtle's having dinner with his family.

682
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:25,700
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}他告诉他的小乌龟们  他是如何成功的
He's telling his little box turtles how he did it.

683
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,700
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}"永不放弃  我...
"I mean, never give up. I...

684
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,200
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}一直不停往前爬
"Just keep crawling forwards, and...

685
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:34,620
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你就能战胜一切"
you can overcome just about anything."

686
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:39,460
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}这时门被撞开
Door smashes in.

687
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:43,380
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}是兔子
It's the jackrabbit.

688
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,390
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}他拿着把锤子
And he has a hammer.

689
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:51,450
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}他先砸死妻子和孩子们
Smashes up the wife and kids first

690
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:53,770
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}这样乌龟就得眼睁睁看着他们死
so the box turtle has to watch 'em die.

691
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:57,060
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}然后轮到他
And then it's his turn.

692
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,730
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}乌龟一家人都被砸成碎块后
Once the whole family's broken into little pieces...

693
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:04,190
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}兔子坐下来  吃他们的晚餐
...he sits down and eats their dinner.

694
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:08,410
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}一口不剩
Every last bite.

695
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:20,170
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}因为兔子永远是赢家
'Cause the jackrabbit always wins.

696
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:26,050
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你妈妈跟你讲这种故事吗
Your mama told you that story?

697
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:28,480
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}等等
Uh, so... so wait.

698
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:30,850
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}那谁是兔子
So, who's the rabbit?

699
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:33,470
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我们还是他们
I mean, i-is it us or them?

700
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:43,020
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你也看见一只穿着衣服的猪了吧
You see a pig with a shirt on, right?

701
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:46,570
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}对
Yep.

702
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:48,320
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}一只小猪
A little pig.

703
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,590
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}奥利弗到底在哪
Where the hell is Oliver?

704
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,840
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}他去找他们已经好几小时了
He left to get them hours ago.

705
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,590
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}他肯定没事的  泰德
I'm sure he's fine, Ted.

706
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:09,530
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}天啊  阿娃·杜威内导演刚给我点了赞
Oh, wow. Ava DuVernay just liked one of my posts.

707
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:10,970
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你也是阿娃的朋友吗
You're friends with Ava, too?

708
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:14,140
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}不是  也许吧
No. Uh, maybe.

709
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,740
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我们在"全球最具影响力百人"晚宴见过
We met at a Time 100 dinner.

710
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,450
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}她点赞的就是这张照片
Th-This is the photo that she liked.

711
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:18,580
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我在海地时拍的
It's from when I was in Haiti.

712
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,870
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}等等  等一下  你去过海地吗
Wait a second. Wait. You were in Haiti?

713
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:22,580
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}再告诉我们一次  你去哪里做什么来着
Remind us, what were you doing there again?

714
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:24,790
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你在棚户区治疗艾滋
You were curing AIDS in a favela.

715
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:24,790
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}-艾滋  -那不是...
- Aids. - Isn't that...

716
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:27,570
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}-别拿艾滋开玩笑  -不不  我没开玩笑
- Don't joke about AIDS. - No, no, no. I'm not joking.

717
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,050
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}艾滋是很严肃的事
AIDS is very, very serious,

718
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:34,120
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}幸好马丁独力承担起如此重责大任
and thank God Martin is single-handedly taking it on.

719
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:38,510
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}好了  首先  海地没有棚户区
Okay. First of all, there are no favelas in Haiti.

720
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:39,930
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}-那是巴西才有的  -我只是...
- That's Brazil. - Well, I just...

721
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:42,710
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我听说你在那里搞大了一个女孩的肚子
I-I heard that you got a girl pregnant down there.

722
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:45,190
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我只是陷入爱河了
I fell in love.

723
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:45,980
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}希望她赞成堕胎合法
Hope she was pro-choice.

724
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:47,980
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}别拿选择开玩笑  拜托
Don't joke about choice, man, please.

725
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:49,770
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}重要的是海地这几十年来
What matters is that Haiti is in the midst

726
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:52,260
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}都处于人道主义危机之中
of a decades-long humanitarian crisis,

727
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,400
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}它需要一切可能的帮助
and it needs all the help it can get.

728
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,220
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}谢谢你
Thank you.

729
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:56,860
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}-那需要马丁的精液吗  -够了
- Does it need Martin's semen? - Okay.

730

877
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:19,320
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你知道马丁的账户上周被黑了吧
So, you're aware Martin's account got hacked last week, right?

878
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:21,600
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我是总裁  保罗  我什么都知道
I'm the CEO, Paul. I hear everything.

And Martin's one of my closest friends.

880
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:28,190
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}那你肯定知道他的处境有多尴尬
So you know how embarrassing it was for him.

881
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:32,170
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}公开他的婚外情
All the, uh, extramarital communiqués.

882
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:36,380
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我觉得只是给他妻子的肿瘤医生发屌照
I call it sending his wife's oncologist pictures of his cock.

883
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:38,130

and he said some extraordinarily critical things about the president.

886
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:46,850
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我记得现在还是言论自由的吧
Last I heard, free speech still exists.

887

Don't do that. Don't-don't First Amendment me, please.

888
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:52,090
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}这不是国家  这是生意
It's not a country. It's a business.

889
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:54,960
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}生意就要顾及形象
A business, and there are optics.

890
01:01:55,770 --> 01:01:57,010
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你开除了马丁吗
You fired Martin?

891
01:01:57,110 --> 01:01:59,320
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}不  他知道自己要为团队承担责任
No, he realized he had to take one for the team.

892
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:00,860
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}-团队  -对  团队

905
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:38,110
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}没有什么比去庄园
"Nothing better than going out to The Manor

906
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:40,340
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}杀十几个可怜人更开心的事了"
and slaughtering a dozen deplorables."

907
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:44,220
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}米兰达说  我们说好不会在短信里说起庄园的
Miranda: "We promised not to talk about The Manor on text."

908
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:46,470
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}泰德说  庄园万岁
Ted: "Viva El Manor."

909
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:48,810

Liberty: "Deleting this thread."

910
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:52,770
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我想起来了

911
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:57,080
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你知不知道外界有一些人
Are you aware there's an active group of people out there

912
01:02:57,090 --> 01:02:58,820
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}认为这是真的
who believe this is a real thing?

913
01:02:59,050 --> 01:03:01,570
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}认为什么是真的
Believe wh-what's a real thing?

914
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:04,280
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你们为了消遣而狩猎人类
That you're hunting human beings for sport.

915
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,210
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}不好笑
Yeah, not funny.

But, anyway, somebody pulled a property-tax record

920
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:31,540
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}买下一座庄园的财产税记录
for the manor that you bought in Vermont.

921
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:35,440
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}庄园  我在佛蒙特可没有什么庄园
"Manor"? No, I don't own a fucking manor in Vermont.

922
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:38,080
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}那是一幢三居室的房子
It's a three-bedroom house.

923

{\fnKaiTi\fs12}"可怜人"

{\fnKaiTi\fs12}这...很歧视
It's... charged.

928

Oh, well, I initially typed "fucking rednecks,"

929
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,100
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}然后我发现不一定全都是...

937
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:08,030
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}希望能赶紧压下这件事
in the hopes this thing doesn't go mainstream.

938
01:04:08,030 --> 01:04:10,060
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}但就算真的发生了奇迹  真的压下来了...
But even if by some miracle it doesn't--

939
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:11,930
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我觉得基本没有可能...
and I really don't see that happening--

{\fnKaiTi\fs12}他们毁了水和披萨  为什么不再祸害庄园呢
Well, they ruined water and pizza. Why not manors?

976
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:41,370
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}听着  我和大家一样
Listen, I want to slaughter all of them

977
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:42,750
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}想把他们都杀了
just like everybody else here, okay,

978
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:44,000
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}但是我们的军事顾问说
but our military consultant says

979
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,540
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我们必须在12点结束
we got to cap it out at 12.

980
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:47,150
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}为什么  这是我们的第一次
Why? It's our first time.

981
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:48,990
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}安全考虑  好吗
Safety reasons, okay?

982
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:51,430
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}天  上帝不希望伤害到他人
Heavens. God forbid somebody gets hurt.

983
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:53,640
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你穿着和服吗  你这叫挪用  理查德
Is that a kimono? That's appropriation, Richard.

984
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:55,040
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}利伯蒂和泰德在哪里
Hey, where are Liberty and Ted?

985
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:56,810
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}-在治疗  -天啊  又去了
- In therapy. - Jesus. Again?

986
01:05:56,810 --> 01:05:58,100
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}他们失去了一切  理查德
They lost everything, Richard.

987
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:00,140
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}他们失去了工作和名誉
They-they lost their jobs and their reputations.

988
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:01,520
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我也是  米兰达
Yeah, so did I, Miranda.

989
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,150
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}但我在慢慢接受
But I'm dealing with it with, you know,

990
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:04,690
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}用药和酒  就像普通人
drugs and alcohol, like a normal person.

991
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:07,170
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}不好意思  这里有人被派到克罗地亚了吗
Excuse me, did anyone else here get reassigned to Croatia?

992
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:08,900
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}没有吗  因为我可是被派了
No? No? Because I did.

993
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:10,280
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}那可能还是件好事呢
That was a blessing in disguise.

994
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,610
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我们不用花几分钱就能建好那个加油站
We're gonna build that gas station for pennies.

995
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:13,720
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}不用引渡...下一张
There's no extradition... Next slide.

996
01:06:16,830 --> 01:06:19,490
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}-不  不  -天啊  奥利弗  我不觉得
- No, no. - Jesus, Oliver, I don't think...

997
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:20,500
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}听着  听着  听着
Listen. Listen, listen, listen, listen,

998
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:22,830
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}如果我们连一个有色人种都没有
if we don't have at least one person of color in this,

999
01:06:22,830 --> 01:06:24,400
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}那肯定会有问题的
it is going to be problematic.

1000
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:27,290
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我假装成阿拉伯难民  其实我来自康涅狄格州
I'm playing an Arab refugee. I'm from Connecticut.

1001
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:28,380
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}这没有问题吗
Isn't that a little problematic?

1002
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:30,130
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}-那是你的主意  -是你的主意
- That was your idea. - It was your idea.

1003
01:06:30,130 --> 01:06:30,840
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你说出来的感觉更奇怪了
It was weird when you said it.

1004
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:35,090
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}因为我们要遵循刻板印象
Because we need to lean in to the stereotype...

1005
01:06:35,090 --> 01:06:36,930
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}-没错  -让他们暴露出他们的偏向
- Correct. - ...to let them just expose their biases.

1006
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:39,010
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}或者只要他们拿起枪  我们就打死他们
Yeah, or we can just shoot 'em as soon as they grab their guns.

1007
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:40,680
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}那他们就不知道我们为什么要杀他们了
Then they're not gonna know why we're killing them, okay?

1008
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:42,420
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}-下一张  -我们有机会...
- Next slide. - We have the opportunity to...

1009
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:46,560
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}好了  Justice4Yall
Okay. Justice4Yall.

1010

{\fnKaiTi\fs12}她6.5分
She's a 6.5.

1011
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:49,470
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}她是这么说的
This is what she says.

1012
01:06:50,070 --> 01:06:51,550
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}"这个女人去死吧
"Fuck this bitch.

1013
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:54,780
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}雅典娜·斯通杀死无辜的男..."
Athena Stone murders innocent men and..."

1014
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:56,180
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我不需要继续听下去了
I don't need to hear more.

1015
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,270
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}这就是我们的雪球
That's our Snowball.

1016
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:17,620
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}把你的枪放在信箱里
Put your gun in the mailbox.

1017
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:22,600
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我为什么要这么做
Why the fuck would I do that?

1018
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:25,290
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}大门下埋了一个改装的C4炸弹
There's a shaped C-4 charge underneath the gate.

1019
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,170
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我可以随时把你炸飞
I could blow you up right now.

1020
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,800
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}不过那有什么意思呢
But where's the fun in that?

1021
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:34,390
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}不许带枪
No guns.

1022
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:37,140
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}给我放在信箱里
Put it in the mailbox. Now.

1023
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,160
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我一直觉得很神奇
It's amazing to me.

1024
01:09:25,890 --> 01:09:27,310
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}人们往往穷尽一生
People go their entire lives

1025
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:30,670
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}都不知道最简单和明显的真相
without realizing the most simple, obvious truth.

1026
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:35,220
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}削番茄最好的方式
The only way to properly slice tomatoes

1027
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:37,760
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}就是用面包刀
is with a bread knife.

1028
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:43,100
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你杀了唐吗
Did you kill Don?

1029
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:48,350
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}因为我让你以为他是我们的人
Because I convinced you he was one of us.

1030
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:49,520
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}是吗
Was he?

1031
01:09:50,790 --> 01:09:51,610
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}也许吧
Maybe.

1032
01:09:52,710 --> 01:09:53,860
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}也许不是
Maybe not.

1033
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:58,450
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我是谁
Who am I?

1034
01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:04,490
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我是谁
Who am I?

1035
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:08,170
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}女士  我不知道你是谁
Lady, I don't know who you are.

1036
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:10,020
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我只知道你疯了
I just know that you're crazy.

1037

{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我疯了
I am crazy.

1038
01:10:11,770 --> 01:10:13,000
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}但我知道我疯了
But I know I'm crazy.

1039
01:10:13,150 --> 01:10:16,170
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}如果你知道你疯了  那你就没有疯
And if you know you're crazy, then you're not crazy.

1040
01:10:16,650 --> 01:10:19,930
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}所以这让我非常非常生气
So that just makes me really, really mad.

1041
01:10:20,610 --> 01:10:21,470
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}好吧
Okay.

1042
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:23,640
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}那我是谁

Born in Mississippi, Whites Crossing.

1045
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:32,960
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}在那长大
Fitting.

1046
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,570
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}12岁退学
Dropped out of school at 12,

1047
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:36,960
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}就是在你爸爸死于
right around the time your daddy was killed by the police

1048
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,960
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}警察突袭冰毒实验室后
when they raided the methamphetamine lab.

1049
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:41,530
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你妈妈不久以后也服药过量  随他而去
Your mother joined him soon after that-- overdose.

1050
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:44,490
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}可能是爸爸制的最后一批
Probably the last batch of Daddy's stuff.

1051
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:47,500
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}真浪漫
Romantic.

1052
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:55,960
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}很多人都觉得烤奶酪应该用
You know, most people think that you should use cheddar

1053
01:10:56,270 --> 01:10:59,970
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}切达芝士  但我用格鲁叶芝士
in a grilled cheese, but I use Gruyère.

1054
01:11:01,780 --> 01:11:03,970
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}其他芝士融化后都没有这种感觉
Nothing else has that kind of melt.

1055
01:11:05,450 --> 01:11:09,080
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你母亲死后  你就到处打打零工
After your mom died, you bounced from part-time job to part-time job,

{\fnKaiTi\fs12}辗转于福利院
to welfare and back.

{\fnKaiTi\fs12}说实话  我都记不清有几次了
More times than I could count, honestly.

1058
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:17,190
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}唯一不变的是你每一份工作都干不长
The only consistency was your inability to stay employed.

1059
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:19,500
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}这没关系
Which is fine.

1060
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:22,880
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}这个国家属于那些没有受过教育和无知的人
I mean, this country belongs to the uneducated and ignorant

1061
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,700
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}也属于我
as much as it belongs to me.

1062
01:11:25,550 --> 01:11:27,160
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你失败  我们出钱
You fail, we pay.

{\fnKaiTi\fs12}最终  你会被一头牛砸死
Eventually, a cow falls on your head

1064
01:11:30,850 --> 01:11:32,720
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}或者在停车场里把自己一枪崩了
or you blow your brains out in a parking lot

1065
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:37,130
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}因为你终于意识到你的人生到底有多么浪费
because you finally realize what a waste your life truly was.

1066
01:11:38,150 --> 01:11:39,340
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}但你不是  克里斯托
But not you, Crystal.

1067
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:42,320
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你决定上网
You decided to go on the Internet

1068
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:43,840
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}开启你愚蠢的嘴巴
and run your stupid mouth.

13 months ago, you posted this on a message board

1070
01:11:49,450 --> 01:11:52,020
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}在留言板上写了这个
under the screen name Justice4Yall.

{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我想确保...我没有弄错
I want to make sure I... I get it exactly right.

The evidence is all there."

"Her manor, her travel records.

"Oh, and in case you were still on the fence,

1078
01:12:17,730 --> 01:12:21,130
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}她在短信里全部承认了"
she fucking admitted to it in a text message."

"Admitted" was all caps.

1080
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:31,070
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你就这个反应吗
"Huh"? That's all you have to say for yourself?

1081
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:34,480
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你绑架杀害这些人
Everybody you kidnapped and killed,

1082
01:12:36,370 --> 01:12:38,370
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}就是因为他们把你和你朋友干的事
that's 'cause they busted you and your friends

1083
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:39,370
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}曝光在网络上吗
and put it on the Internet?

1084
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:41,030
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}没有人曝光我们
No one busted us.

1085
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:42,740
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我们是在开玩笑
We were joking.

1086
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,630
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}但是你这无知的蠢蛋信了
But you ignorami took it literally.

{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你真的相信我们会为了消遣而狩猎真人
You actually believed we were hunting human beings for sport.

{\fnKaiTi\fs12}之前不是真的
It wasn't true.

1092
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:01,230
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}这里就是你的庄园  对吗
This is your manor, isn't it?

1093
01:13:01,230 --> 01:13:03,860
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}这不是庄园
It's not a fucking manor.

1094
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:06,570
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}这是我在克罗地亚租了以后装潢的房子
It's a house I rented in Croatia and had decorated.

1095
01:13:06,570 --> 01:13:07,820
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}好吧  但这里属于你
Okay, right, but it's yours,

1096
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:09,640
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你在狩猎真人  所以...
and you're hunting people, so it's...

1097
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,350
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}就是真的
I mean, it's true.

1098
01:13:12,370 --> 01:13:13,180
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}现在
Now.

1099
01:13:13,330 --> 01:13:17,620
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}现在是真的  因为是被你们逼的
Now it's true because you made it true.

1100
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:19,830
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你们这些人断章取义
You people, you take anything you want,

1101
01:13:19,830 --> 01:13:21,750
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}曲解成符合你们
and you twist it around until it fits

1102
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:24,650
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}落后世界观的意思
into your backwards fucking worldview.

1103
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:28,950
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你希望这是真的  所以你决定这就是真的
You wanted it to be true, so you decided it was.

1104
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:32,870
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}这就是你的想法
This was your idea.

1105
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:36,710
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}好吧...
Well...

1106
01:13:38,730 --> 01:13:40,380
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}不是我的想法
not my idea.

1107
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:45,590
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我不想破坏你的烤芝士大演讲  但是...
Ooh, I did not want to mess up your big grilled-cheese speech, but...

1108
01:13:47,150 --> 01:13:48,930
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你完蛋了  女士
oh, you done fucked up, lady.

1109
01:13:51,490 --> 01:13:54,060
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你找错克里斯托了
See, you got the wrong Crystal.

1110
01:13:54,990 --> 01:13:58,060
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我们那里还有一个克里斯托·梅·克瑞西
There's another Crystal May Creasey back home.

1111
01:13:59,910 --> 01:14:01,900
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}不过她的中间名比我多一个E
But she spells "May" with an "E."

1112
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:06,650
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我有时候会收到给她的邮件
Hey, I get her mail sometimes.

1113
01:14:07,130 --> 01:14:09,300
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我爸爸的确是个混蛋
And my dad's an asshole,

1114
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:11,950
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}但我觉得他应该不会制毒
but I don't think he ever did drugs.

1115
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:13,830
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我妈妈...
And my mom...

1116
01:14:18,140 --> 01:14:20,540
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}她还活着
...she's alive, too.

1117
01:14:24,610 --> 01:14:25,310
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我们能给她打个电话吗
Can we call her?

1118
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:26,770
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}-我们给她打个电话吧  -不
- Let's call her right now. - No.

1119
01:14:26,770 --> 01:14:27,650
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}-把手机给我  -不可能
- Give me the phone. - No way.

1120
01:14:27,650 --> 01:14:29,150
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}-我给她打电话  -我看上去很蠢吗
- I'll call her up. - Do I look fucking stupid?

1121
01:14:29,150 --> 01:14:31,050
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}好吧  我给你号码  你来打
Fine. I'll give you her number, and you can call.

1122
01:14:31,450 --> 01:14:32,680
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}不可能
That's not gonna happen.

1123
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:36,910
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你其实并不在乎真相  对吗
Hoo, you don't really care about the truth, do you?

1124
01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:37,980
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我当然在乎
Of course I do.

1125
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:41,690
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}唯一的区别就是  我是对的
The only difference is I'm right.

1126
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:45,360
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}也许吧
Hey, maybe.

1127
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,110
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}也许不是
Maybe not.

1128
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:53,260
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我要继续听贝多芬
Now, do I have to keep listening to Beethoven,

1129
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:55,330
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}还是说我们能直接开始
or can we fucking get on with it?

1130
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:27,480
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}真不错
That was good.

1131
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:06,110
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}不
No!

1132
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:21,620
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}克里斯托
Hey, Crystal.

1133
01:16:24,930 --> 01:16:25,630
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}该死
Fuck!

1134
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:30,730
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你需要枪吗  贱人
You need a gun now, bitch?!

1135
01:16:30,730 --> 01:16:32,220
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你这是作弊
That's fucking cheating!

1136
01:17:00,970 --> 01:17:02,250
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}去你妈的
Fuck you!

1137
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:04,310
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}等一下
One second.

1138
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:30,380
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}不要再撞玻璃了
No more glass!

1139
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:25,350
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我扎中你了
I got you.

1140
01:19:56,150 --> 01:19:56,840
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}好吧
Okay.

1141
01:20:12,490 --> 01:20:13,850
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我也扎中你了
I got you, too.

1142
01:20:17,210 --> 01:20:18,940
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我能问你一个问题吗
Hey, can I ask you a question?

1143
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:27,870
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你为什么叫我雪球
Why did you call me Snowball?

1144
01:20:29,090 --> 01:20:30,500
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}是一个比喻
It's a reference.

1145
01:20:31,430 --> 01:20:34,080
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}乔治·奥威尔的《动物农场》
To George Orwell's Animal Farm.

1146
01:20:35,930 --> 01:20:37,420
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}它是一头猪
He's a pig.

1147
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:41,760
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}但为什么我是雪球
Yeah, but why am I Snowball?

1148
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:46,550
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}雪球是一个理想家
Snowball is an idealist.

1149
01:20:46,950 --> 01:20:50,700
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}它...它想让这个世界变得更好
He... he wants to make the world a better place.

1150
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:54,600
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}所以其他猪会编造关于它的谎言
That's why the other pigs make up lies about him,

1151
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:56,770
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}把它扔给敌人
turn him into the enemy.

1152
01:20:59,790 --> 01:21:01,570
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我觉得你才应该是雪球
I think you should be Snowball.

1153
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:05,860
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你读过《动物农场》
You read Animal Farm?

1154
01:21:07,130 --> 01:21:08,780
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}是的  女士
Yes, ma'am, I did.

1155
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:13,500
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我能...
Can I...

1156
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:16,710
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}问你一个问题吗
ask you a question?

1157
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:22,090
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你是Justice4Yall
Are you Justice4Yall?

1158
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:25,300
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}拜托
Come on.

1159
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:27,800
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我们都要死了
We're both dead.

1160
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:29,760
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}告诉我
Just tell me.

1161
01:21:30,450 --> 01:21:32,600
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我抓对了克里斯托  对吗
I got the right Crystal, didn't I?

1162
01:21:35,410 --> 01:21:38,480
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}不  女士  你没有
No, ma'am, you did not.

1163
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:38,070
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你好
Hey there.

1164
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:38,990
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}该死
Oh, shit.

1165
01:23:38,990 --> 01:23:39,810
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}那些...
The, uh...

1166
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:44,860
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}雇你们的混蛋想杀我
assholes you work for tried to kill me,

1167
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:47,440
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}于是我把他们都杀了
so I killed them instead.

1168
01:23:48,380 --> 01:23:49,860
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}我现在想要回家
Now I want to go home.

1169
01:23:52,130 --> 01:23:53,490
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}有问题吗
That gonna be a problem?

1170
01:23:54,470 --> 01:23:55,720
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}当然没有  女士
Certainly not, ma'am.

1171
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:56,370
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}没有
No.

1172
01:23:57,510 --> 01:23:59,370
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}要...要我给您倒一杯酒吗
May I... may I pour that for you?

1173
01:23:59,930 --> 01:24:00,790
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}好
Yeah.

1174
01:24:11,150 --> 01:24:14,190
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}要来点吃的吗  我们有上好的鱼子酱
How about a snack? We have fantastic caviar.

1175
01:24:14,190 --> 01:24:15,430
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}-是奥斯特拉...  -好
- It's osetra... - Yeah.

1176
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:17,060
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}没问题
You got it.

1177
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:27,940
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你吃过鱼子酱吗
You ever had caviar?

1178
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:31,530
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}不  我没有  我应该不能吃这些
No, I-I don't... I don't think I'm really allowed to.

1179
01:24:31,630 --> 01:24:33,820
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}你现在可以了  坐下吧
Well, you are now. Have a seat.

1180
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:37,330
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}来挖一勺
Dig in.

1181
01:24:47,810 --> 01:24:48,840
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}味道怎么样
H-how is it?

1182
01:24:53,650 --> 01:24:56,300
{\fnKaiTi\fs12}真是太棒了
It's fucking great.
