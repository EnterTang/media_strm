1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,919
马男波杰克中

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,520
着重描写了关于抑郁的部分

 

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,279
and if this was a different show it

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,880
might have been the series finale

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,719
for five seasons we saw bojack's

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,080
selfishness and toxicity permeate

7
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,679
throughout his life and the lives of

8
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,759
those he cares about but now

9
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,199
after a stint in rehab we actually start

10
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,640
to see important growth

11
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,640
from a man who didn't think that he was

12
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,320
capable of change over the course of the

13
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,400
face of depression bojack starts to

14
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,320
understand what it means to be a present

15
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,640
and caring friend and not unlike his

16
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,480
toxicity this change starts to have

17
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,519
tangible effects that permeate his

18
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,880
friends lives

19
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,640
and though we know that the show would

20
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,320
go on to hold bojack accountable for the

21
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,920
ways he hurt and abused people

22
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,160
this was still one of the most important

23
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,480
stops on bojack's journey one that tells

24
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,840
us

25
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,030
it's never too late to change for the

26
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,619
better

27
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,619
[Music]

28
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,879
the episode begins with bojack cleaning

29
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,280
up the mess left behind when he went to

30
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,719
rehab but in doing so it dredges up all

31
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,239
kinds of painful memories

32
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,079
memories of the ways he hurt and abused

33
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,600
people in his life we see the echoes of

34
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,520
his mistakes across the house

35
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,199
his fight with gina driving his car into

36
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,240
his pool throwing his mother's babies

37
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,000
all over the balcony

38
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,840
when he can't take it anymore he gets in

39
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,760
his car and he drives but the memories

40
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,520
continue as his own words and the words

41
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,200
of his friends echo through his mind

42
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,439
please don't make me go back to la you

43
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,040
can count on me you are all the things

44
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,119
that are wrong with you now that he's

45
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,560
sober he has no way to drown out the

46
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,400
memories of those regrets

47
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,080
he has to live with sarah lynn's death

48
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,200
and the events of new mexico and is

49
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,040
falling out with todd

50
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,119
and it all ends on one haunting but

51
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,840
exceedingly important memory of himself

52
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,840
and diane

53
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,920
i haven't changed at all yes you are the

54
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,640
last person to get that i'm not gonna

55
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,000
change as mojack arrives at his a.a

56
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,680
meeting he realizes sharona

57
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,520
the stylist from horsing around is there

58
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,200
too and once again he's flooded with

59
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,880
memories of his mistakes forcing the

60
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,479
blame for cereal and getting drunk onto

61
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,560
sharona back in the 90s

62
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,399
and getting her fired after this bojack

63
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,159
goes out to eat with todd who casually

64
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,880
says something important it can't be at

65
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,399
my house

66
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,399
just reminds me of what an i've

67
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,759
been makes sense your house reminds me

68
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,119
of what an you've been to

69
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,119
the sequence illustrates that bojack

70
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,360
cannot escape his mistakes but in the

71
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,119
end

72
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,880
bojack shouldn't be escaping his

73
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,720
mistakes he should remember

74
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,479
the lasting effects of his own actions

75
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,599
because if he doesn't he'll simply be

76
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,599
doomed to repeat them

77
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,080
i'm not gonna change i wanted to thank

78
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,680
you for jack's memory of his fight with

79
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,680
diane as i've said before

80
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,080
is exceedingly important you haven't

81
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,000
changed at all yes congratulations you

82
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,480
are the last person to get that i'm not

83
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,200
gonna

84
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,120
change bojack was unwilling or felt he

85
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,040
was incapable of changing he felt that

86
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,120
he was doomed to repeat his cycles of

87
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,400
abuse and toxicity no matter what he did

88
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,160
so he didn't even try

89
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,480
but through his time at rehab and now

90
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,480
his reacclimation to a sober life in the

91
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,400
outside world we begin to see change

92
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,239
actually take hold though it is a

93
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,599
process we even see him still fighting

94
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,040
some of his old tendencies throughout

95
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,080
the episode when he's eating lunch with

96
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,599
todd todd actually

97
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,200
tries to open up about his difficult

98
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,640
relationship with his mother but bojack

99
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,360
doesn't really recognize that todd is

100
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,480
reaching out

101
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,959
moms are weird right um yeah moms are

102
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,040
weird

103
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,560
at his a.a meeting he seems exasperated

104
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,239
by the act of admitting that he's an

105
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,440
alcoholic i'm bojack

106
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:11,120
and oh god it feels so

107
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,800
dumb and i'm an alcoholic

108
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,800
when he goes to visit princess carolyn

109
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,080
he makes up a selfless excuse

110
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,159
even though he's actually there for a

111
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,560
selfish reason i also have a favor to

112
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,800
ask

113
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,640
of course you do but these things slowly

114
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,239
start to fade as he visits his friends

115
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,239
and family and he actually starts to

116
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,959
learn more about himself and the process

117
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,720
of forgiveness

118
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,959
the metamorphosis mostly begins with his

119
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,480
visit to see diane in chicago dan

120
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,319
is going through an incredibly difficult

121
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,000
time in her life and doesn't want bojack

122
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,360
to see the mess that she's living in but

123
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,959
through their heart to heart bojack

124
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,599
admits something that he's learned about

125
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,720
himself

126
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,799
and does something that we haven't seen

127
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,080
much of from him i bought into this idea

128
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,080
that i was the thing that couldn't be

129
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,239
changed bojack acknowledges that he had

130
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,760
stifled himself in his ability to change

131
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,159
and then immediately does something that

132
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,920
showcases that change he thanks diane

133
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,480
but this is more than just a typical

134
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,560
thank you

135
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,480
bojack is effectively thanking diane for

136
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,680
the events of their fallout so

137
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,080
the reason i came to chicago is

138
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,360
i wanted to thank you for believing in

139
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,280
me when i didn't

140
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,280
because in the end diane's frustrations

141
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,040
and anger towards bojack in season five

142
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,560
all stemmed from her belief that he

143
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,879
could and should be better

144
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,959
that he can and should be able to change

145
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,359
bojack was the one who wasn't willing

146
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,040
but now he is he's willing to learn and

147
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,880
grow the next morning before leaving

148
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,639
bojack cleans up diane's apartment and

149
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,320
leaves before she even wakes up

150
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,080
he does something selfless simply to

151
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,520
help his friend without the expectation

152
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,280
of anything in return or even

153
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,639
acknowledgement of his good deed the

154
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,000
change is taking place

155
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,440
and through his next trip to connecticut

156
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,199
to visit hollyhock bojack actually

157
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,639
learns more about his own tendencies

158
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,080
while spending time with his sister he

159
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,120
witnesses hollyhock fighting with her

160
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,680
best friend tawny

161
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,759
you could say sorry would it even matter

162
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,520
no words are meaningless this showcases

163
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,880
bojack's belief that asking for

164
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,199
forgiveness

165
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,080
isn't enough he is like tawny in this

166
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,320
situation

167
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,840
so firmly confident that his mistake

168
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,840
can't be made up for that he is

169
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,600
unwilling to even apologize but then he

170
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,680
sees how hollyhock responds

171
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,680
you do this thing where you don't think

172
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,240
you can ever be forgiven so you don't

173
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,360
apologize but i can't forgive you if you

174
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,440
don't say you're sorry

175
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,880
bojack sees that though mistakes can't

176
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,800
necessarily be fixed

177
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,039
showcasing remorse and acknowledging

178
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,080
your mistakes can go a really long way

179
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:21,039
okay i'm sorry thank you

180
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,240
that's all i wanted i'm sorry i love you

181
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,080
bojack starts to become less

182
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,759
self-absorbed and more cognizant

183
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,199
of the people around him this is pretty

184
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,120
blatantly hinted at when he gives his

185
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,199
narcissist portrait to princess caroline

186
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,039
the narcissus myth is specifically one

187
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,160
of an attractive self-absorbed person

188
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,800
who falls in love with his own

189
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,320
reflection

190
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,919
to the point where he is unwilling to

191
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,280
leave the water to stop staring at

192
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,720
himself this is actually where the word

193
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,919
narcissism comes from

194
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,840
narcissist i thought the painting was

195
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,199
about me so bojack giving away the

196
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,080
physical representation of his

197
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,759
narcissism

198
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,600
is obviously alluding to him beginning

199
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,080
to give up those tendencies himself

200
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,400
and in his aaa meetings bojack starts to

201
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,120
open up about how uncomfortable he is in

202
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,560
his house

203
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,880
and how he has a hard time feeling like

204
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,600
a changed person in this overly familiar

205
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,240
location

206
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,639
but it's the same house the same city

207
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,080
just nothing's changed

208
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,759
so how am i supposed to but the fact

209
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,759
that bojack is even saying this

210
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,440
is proof that he is changing because the

211
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,600
old bojack would have just let his old

212
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,280
lifestyle reinfect him and sharona

213
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,120
actually sees this change in bojack as

214
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,080
well she sees that he's actually trying

215
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,840
and because of this

216
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,840
she forgives him even before he has a

217
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,680
chance to apologize but of course he

218
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,800
still insists on apologizing

219
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,720
please just let me say it i'm sorry

220
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,560
i'm so sorry and with this change in

221
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,080
bojack's behavior and attitude there is

222
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,759
a physical change as well

223
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,440
shirona gives bojack's hair a trim

224
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,199
revealing his natural grey hair

225
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,199
bojack is a character who effectively

226
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,639
stopped growing in his early 20s when he

227
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,720
got his role on horse and around

228
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,720
that success stagnated his growth in

229
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,680
maturity for years as he tried to relive

230
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,759
his glory days

231
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,880
but now 30 years later as his growth

232
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,639
actually takes hold

233
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,840
the physical growth follows suit he

234
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,280
ditches the old get up that is

235
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,199
reminiscent of his horse in a round

236
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,599
sweater and he looks like a new person

237
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,440
because in a lot of ways he is and as

238
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,199
these changes within bojack take place

239
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,039
he starts to have tangible positive

240
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,039
effects on the people closest to him

241
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,639
i'm sorry i'm so sorry as bojack

242
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,319
undergoes his metamorphosis the effects

243
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,280
of his new attitude start to affect

244
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,639
those around him

245
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,479
at the beginning of the episode we see

246
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,639
how bojack is still fighting some of his

247
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,319
selfish tendencies but the moment things

248
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,880
start to change is when bojack visits

249
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,120
diane

250
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,880
diane is struggling immensely in chicago

251
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,919
she's secured this book deal but hasn't

252
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,000
been able to find the creative

253
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,599
motivation to write her psychiatrist

254
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,599
says she's depressed but because of a

255
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,280
prior experience with antidepressants

256
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,800
she isn't willing to acknowledge this

257
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,800
tried the medication your doctor

258
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,880
prescribed well i'd feel worse

259
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,400
they put me on prozac in college and i

260
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,160
was so calm and boring i didn't even

261
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,080
want a live journal diane relays how she

262
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,000
felt creatively bankrupt when she was

263
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,199
previously on meds and even brings up a

264
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,199
couple specifics

265
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,800
and then dawson's creek got bad because

266
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,720
there was no one to speak truth to power

267
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,720
it made me break out i gained weight

268
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,400
diane is struggling with starting her

269
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,000
path down the road to recovery

270
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,000
and this is actually something a lot of

271
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,039
creatives feel that things that make

272
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,960
them damaged

273
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,960
actually make them interesting and they

274
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,960
fear that by fixing those problems

275
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,039
their creativity and career will suffer

276
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,960
when bojack visits diane she expresses

277
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,960
her fears about how that path to mental

278
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,800
wellness might reveal that she's

279
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,800
uninteresting that there isn't anything

280
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,879
of substance underneath her trauma

281
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,400
because you keep thinking under all that

282
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,039
nothing there's got to be

283
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,039
something but all you find is nothing

284
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,520
but bojack does something incredibly

285
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,120
helpful

286
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,639
though i'm not sure if he recognized

287
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,039
just how helpful it was

288
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,719
i wanted to thank you for believing in

289
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,320
me when i didn't

290
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,159
and for encouraging me to accept the

291
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,320
help i needed in thanking diane for

292
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,320
helping him down his road to recovery

293
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,320
he's effectively doing the same thing

294
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,480
for her bojack and diane have

295
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,760
a lot of similar tendencies by relaying

296
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,839
his own experience

297
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,000
bojack is helping diane see her own

298
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,839
demons and encouraging her to seek the

299
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,519
help she needs at the end of the episode

300
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,080
when guy returns from his trip we see

301
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,560
diane

302
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,160
who like bojack has also undergone a

303
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,839
change in wardrobe but she also is

304
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,680
looking a bit heavier and she's holding

305
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,000
a sign that says dawson's creak was

306
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,200
always bad with a huge smile on her face

307
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,279
diane sought help

308
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,279
she took the meds she was prescribed and

309
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,560
it was all set in motion by bojack's act

310
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,320
of genuine friendship

311
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,600
an act we probably wouldn't have seen

312
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,120
from the old bojack

313
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,720
something similar happens with princess

314
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,240
caroline who's struggling with her fears

315
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,160
about returning to work after spending

316
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,160
so much time with ruthie i'm gonna miss

317
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,000
everything we have this connection now

318
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,920
what if that goes away when i go back to

319
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,440
work the old self-absorbed bojack

320
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,040
probably wouldn't have taken much of an

321
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,040
interest in pc's problem

322
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,640
but not anymore he actually showcases

323
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,480
intimate knowledge of pc's life and

324
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,040
responsibilities and gives her prudent

325
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,440
advice

326
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,080
you are producing a show running a

327
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,399
company

328
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,120
catering to your clients raising a child

329
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,880
a tod

330
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,320
you need your own princess caroline to

331
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,240
take care of you at the end of the

332
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,320
episode princess caroline takes bojack's

333
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,720
advice and rehires judah as a partner at

334
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
vim

335
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,600
by splitting major responsibilities

336
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,040
she'll be able to have a fulfilling

337
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,440
career and spend time with her daughter

338
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,040
as well

339
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,279
she would even go on to marry judah at

340
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,959
the end of the series bojack's change is

341
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,120
already showcasing major tangible

342
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,800
positives in the lives of his loved ones

343
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,959
and this is when bojack actually starts

344
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,399
to go out of his way to help his friends

345
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,720
earlier in the episode todd talked to

346
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,480
bojack about his asexual dating app but

347
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,720
lamented that there was nobody else on

348
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,399
it bojack actually recognizes in passing

349
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,480
that it might be something that mod who

350
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,320
works at cinebuddy is interested in

351
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,000
i don't want to presume anything but

352
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,240
there's an app you might be interested

353
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,320
in

354
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,839
an app todd of course matches with mod

355
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,440
and the two start dating and they even

356
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,200
end up moving in together but the most

357
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,040
charming and memorable way that bojack

358
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,399
helps his friends has got to be with mr

359
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,079
peanut butter we've known from the

360
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,240
moment the show started that mr peanut

361
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,360
butter loves bojack and desperately

362
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,360
wants to be his friend

363
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,800
this was mr peanut butter's very first

364
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,519
line in the entire series

365
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,480
mr peanut butter and bojack horseman in

366
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,440
the same

367
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,440
room what is this a crossover episode

368
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,480
obviously bojack has never really given

369
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,160
him the time of day

370
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,800
but not anymore well looks like you

371
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,200
finally got your crossover episode

372
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,839
what uh oh my god okay is this real

373
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,440
bojack

374
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,959
actually gives mr peanut butter that

375
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,640
crossover episode something we can

376
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,000
without a doubt say that the old bojack

377
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,320
would never have done

378
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,079
and mr peanut butter's happiness cannot

379
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,160
be understated the way that the face of

380
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,320
depression showcases bojack's change

381
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,920
in turn showcases the positive effects

382
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,839
he has on the world around him an

383
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,839
incredibly important message

384
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:21,760
[Music]

385
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,200
peace be with you peace be with you

386
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,720
though bojack has actively undergone

387
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,000
this change throughout the episode the

388
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,519
result of lots of work and

389
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,519
self-reflection in rehab

390
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,360
you know that his regrets and mistakes

391
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,040
still haunt him but bojack shouldn't be

392
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,200
looking to escape his past

393
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,959
he can't move forward without accepting

394
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,040
it so while waiting for his next flight

395
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,800
bojack visits old horseberg and stumbles

396
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,360
upon a reenactment of an old church

397
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,120
service

398
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,200
the words of the pastor really resonate

399
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,519
with bojack it is only when we show

400
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,839
ourselves forgiveness and mercy that we

401
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,480
truly live a life of grace that we are

402
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,680
reborn the pastor tells the congregation

403
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,600
to offer grace

404
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,240
and peace to one another peace be with

405
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,880
you peace be with you peace be with you

406
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,000
peace be with you peace be with you

407
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,600
peace be with you

408
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,519
you can tell how much this affects

409
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,279
bojack in the moment and it's a huge

410
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,639
step for bojag moving forward

411
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,959
as he heads off to his new life at

412
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,760
wesleyan having changed bojack forgives

413
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,600
himself

414
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,040
he doesn't forget about what he did or

415
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,959
run away from his past

416
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,800
he simply accepts that it happened and

417
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,480
allows himself to move forward

418
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,079
this episode operates as though it could

419
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,079
be a series finale

420
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,920
we see bojack make the changes in his

421
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,639
life that we've wanted to see for five

422
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,399
seasons

423
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,839
every main character gets their happy

424
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,120
ending that hints at where they could be

425
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,440
heading moving forward

426
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,160
and the entire episode is incredibly

427
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,600
cathartic

428
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,519
it's the tension release that we've

429
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,240
learned not to expect out of bojack

430
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,760
horseman

431
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,519
while we know that in the following half

432
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,279
of season six bojack would show

433
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,600
regression as his life starts to fall

434
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,279
apart this episode is still a vital

435
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,440
piece of bojack's journey

436
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,600
it shows that bojack is capable of

437
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,680
change it shows that he can be

438
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,800
a fundamentally better person when he

439
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,480
puts in the work

440
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,240
and though the show rightfully held

441
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,720
bojack accountable for the things he had

442
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,480
done

443
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,000
we can remain hopeful that he will

444
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,160
continue down this path

445
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,240
after the end of the series but for now

446
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,680
as james henry jr's song take me down

447
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,639
easy plays us out

448
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,920
we know something else is on the horizon

449
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,959
and now i see

450
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:18,560
storm clouds

451
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:22,399
up in the distance

452
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,399
a terrible omen

453
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,920
a beautiful show

454
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:34,480
so take me down easy

455
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:38,320
take me down easy

456
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,320
