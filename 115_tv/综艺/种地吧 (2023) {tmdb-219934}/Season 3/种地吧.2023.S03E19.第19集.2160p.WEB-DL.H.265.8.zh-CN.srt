1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,990
I'm not sure.

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,130
You're not... sure?

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,490
- I don't know how to answer.
- With the truth.

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:16,850
- I have an obligation.
- No.

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,340
You're a private investigator.

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,470
You don't have
attorney-client privilege.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,740
Here's the
problem,Kalinda--

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,170
the IRS is investigating
you because of this check.

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,840
$3,850.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,370
It was written from what they
determined is a dummy account,

11
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,050
and now they want accounting
for all your freelance work

12
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:35,720
over the last three tax periods.

13
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,130
So... you need to
answer for these checks.

14
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,130
Answer for...?

15
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,180
What the nature of the work
was and who paid for it.

16
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,180
So let's start with this check.

17
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:50,700
$2,460 paid out by FRP
Incorporated for three days' work.

18
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,840
What was the nature of that
work and who paid for it?

19
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,980
Look...I don't...I don't
mean to be guarded here.

20
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,760
But you are being guarded here.

21
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,270
Yes,but the difficulty is,is that

22
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,210
I did this work for
someone you know,and...

23
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,110
I think it would be unfair
to them to divulge it.

24
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,310
It's not who you think.

25
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,120
And who do I think?

26
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,550
One second.

27
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,120
Diane,do you have a minute?

28
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,690
I did the work for Diane.

29
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,440
Well...

30
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,750
why wasn't it paid
through Lockhart/Gardner

31
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,690
Well,it's not a work matter.

32
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,220
I'd rather stick to generalities here.

33
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,490
Okay.so how would you define this work?

34
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,230
Firearm lessons.

35
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,590
Well,that helps.

36
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,680
- Diane wants to talk to you.
- Okay,thanks.

37
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,170
We're gonna have to go
over the other checks,but...

38
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,340
I will try to stick to generalities.

39
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,070
Thanks.I'll try to get permission.

40
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,780
I just got a call asking me
to sit on a blue ribbon panel,

41
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,440
and,uh,as you can
see,I'm,uh,fairly busy.

42
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,390
It's a routine civilian
review of an IPRA,

43
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,810
Independent Police Review Authority.

44
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,310
It's a police shooting.

45
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,020
They asked for a
replacement,and I suggested you.

46
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,780
Me?

47
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,140
wouldn't they want someone
with more experience?

48
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,760
No.What they want is a woman.

49
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,450
- Well...
- I mean,this happens lot.

50
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,200
They go fishing at the last mite for
a balance,uh,Republican or a woman.

51
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,510
I mean,it's good for
your career and the firm.

52
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,070
You work with judges
and influential lawyers.

53
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,210
Yes.Thank you,I would love to,Diane.

54
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,130
Good.I'll give them a call.

55
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,730
And...thank you for my salary bump.

56
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,710
Yes.I hear you're buying a house.

57
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,210
Well,I'm-I'm making an offer today.

58
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,620
Good.

59
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,380
So you're the woman.

60
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,750
I guess I am.

61
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,810
I'm the black.

62
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,970
Mike,how are you!

63
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,020
Pastor Damon,I'm so
glad you could make it.

64
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,340
I have a tape of one of your
sermons running in my car.

65
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,430
Now,that is dangerous.

66
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,340
And you know His Honor Peter Dunaway.

67
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,130
Nice to see you again.

68
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,280
And his Equally-honorableHarvey Winter.

69
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,510
Okay,we're gonna have to cut that out

70
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,310
or you're gonna be
"honoring" it up a day.

71
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,150
Gentlemen,it's good to meet you.

72
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:41,900
Chicago,to my mind,has the
best justice money can buy.

73
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,650
Alicia Florrick.Now,this
truly is an honor.

74
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,160
Mike Kresteva,of
Sellers,Kresteva & Landry.

75
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,540
Thank you for doing this.

76
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,670
no,no.Ank you for the invite.

77
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,670
Although I have to admit I
feel a little...outclassed.

78
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,850
Well,here's the trick.

79
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,500
Without the robes,these
judges are just pussycats.

80
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,550
Ist that so,Harv?

81
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,810
Whatever he said about me,he's lying.

82
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,880
- You've been in my
court-- Ms... - Florrick.

83
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,450
I see.A woman and a connection
to the state's attorney's office.

84
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,780
Nice bank shot,Mike.

85
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,010
And I believe you know the
incredibly handsome Harvey Winter.

86
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,950
I'm a friend of your
husband's,Mrs. Florrick.

87
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,100
I'm glad to see he's thriving.

88
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,150
Thank you.

89
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,910
Well,I think that's all
of us Shall we get started?

90
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:23,130
We ask you,Lord,to give us a
strong mind and discerning spirit.

91
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,120
We ask that the witnesses
answer honestly and completely.

92
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,140
And,as always,we ask that your
truth guide us in all things.

93
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,930
In Jesus' name we pray.

94
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,110
Amen.

95
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,730
Thank you,Pastor.

96
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:42,870
We are reviewing IPRA
packet log number 166616.

97
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,700
Officer-involved shooting
at the Addison El platform.

98
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,570
You'll find your packet front of you.

99
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,750
As blue ribbon panel chair,

100
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,970
I would ask for standard five-minute
questioning periods for all panelists.

101
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,890
- All those in favor?
- Aye.

102
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,610
All those opposed?

103
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,520
Motion passes.

104
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,960
I would also advise that
we confine the witness list

105
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,910
to the four witnesses
in the IPRA report.

106
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,680
- All those in favor?
- Aye.

107
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,430
All those opposed?

108
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,430
Good.

109
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,300
{\a6} <i>Crime Scene *****</i>

110
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:12,230
Well,then I would suggest
we call our first witness.

111
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,260
How's it going down there,Mrs. Florrick?

112
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,090
Just trying to catch up.

113
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,640
You're doing just fine.

114
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,190
We were working undercover.

115
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,370
There were a series of holdups,female
passengers at North Side El platforms.

116
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,920
Officer Trina Coffey and myself
were tasked with a decoy detail.

117
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,980
And you came acrossa perp?

118
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,260
Yes.A two-time felon.

119
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,370
He tried to hold up Officer Coffey.

120
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:38,190
We announced ourselves as police
officers,pulled our firearms,

121
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,840
threw him to the ground,and
that's when I saw...

122
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,340
{\a6} <i>Masters Approaches *******</i>

123
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,230
at the end of the platform,a man
advancing towards us with a handgun

124
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,650
And this was the victim,Roland Masters?

125
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:51,690
I yelled "gun." My partner...

126
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,820
Officer Coffey...

127
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,360
turned and fired on the...

128
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,580
on Mr. Masters.

129
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:02,750
And unfortunately,Mr. Masters
saw your undercover clothesand

130
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,050
thought you were trying
to mug this thief.

131
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,600
Yes.

132
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,090
He was being a Good Samaritan.

133
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,590
But you thought he was another
perp trying to shoot you.

134
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,980
Thank you,Officer.I'm sorry
you have to go through this.

135
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,270
Any questions,Your Honor Dunaway?

136
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,100
Yes,uh,just one.

137
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,010
You identified yourselves
as police officers?

138
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:23,760
Yes.

139
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:27,210
So why do you think the
victim kept advancing on you?

140
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,820
My guess is,he didn't hear us.

141
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,060
There was an express
train on the facing track.

142
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,900
He probably didn't
hear us over the noise.

143
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,230
Thank you,Officer.Nothing else.

144
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,810
Your Honor Winter,five minutes.

145
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,030
No questions.

146
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,070
- Mr. Adams,five minutes.
- No questions.

147
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,200
- Mr. Danforth?
- Nothing.

148
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,000
Pastor Damon,five minutes.

149
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,260
No,I'm fine.

150
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,450
Mrs. Florrick,five minutes.

151
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,660
I...

152
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,620
No questions.

153
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,370
All by a show of hands?

154
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,460
Eight votes.

155
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,460
The motion to remove Will
Gardner from name partnership

156
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,460
and replace him with
David Lee also fails.

157
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,940
This is all backward--
we should vote Will out,

158
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,220
then vote for a replacement.

159
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,170
That's not how we do things here.

160
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,610
Because you know it'll pass.

161
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,300
This firm is limping without a full
lawyer as fellow name partner,Diane.

162
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,020
You just want to hav
an equal vote with her.

163
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,540
I want there to be a
balance of power at the top.

164
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,400
Excuse me,gentlemen,unless
you have more business...

165
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,360
It's my understanding
Mr. Gardner's still

166
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,720
a profit participantwhile
suspended as a lawyer.

167
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,540
I move that...

168
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,040
Could someone put that
into motion words for me?

169
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,220
I move that Will be precluded
from sharing in any firm revenues

170
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,650
during the time in which he
is not actively practicing law.

171
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,090
I second.Call the question.

172
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,680
- Diane,can I have a word.
- No.

173
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,250
A name partner is asking for word.

174
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,890
You can have your vote afterward.

175
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,370
Are they watching us?

176
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:53,830
yeah.

177
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,190
How am I looking?

178
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,900
Little more worried.

179
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,140
Do you think this'll appease
them,me giving up my profits?

180
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,340
They're still coming after your seat.

181
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,220
As long as the three
are divided,I'm fine.

182
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,120
Pretty soon they're
gonna figure that out.

183
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:15,640
Ronnie,I'm sorry for your loss,but
can you help us out here at all?

184
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,510
It's just,you were the only
witness on the platform.

185
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,860
You saw your father being shot?

186
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,520
Did he hear the police
announce themselves?

187
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,160
My dad...

188
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,790
he helped everyone.

189
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:36,740
Your dad held everyone,is
that what you said?

190
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,180
Didn't matter who you were.

191
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,920
Anybody.

192
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,690
He give you money...

193
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,270
He'd...

194
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,480
Pastor.

195
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,680
Son...

196
00:08:55,570 --> 00:09:02,360
I am so sorry,but the best way to
honor your father is to help us here.

197
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:07,290
Did you hear the
policeman yelling,"Police"?

198
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,400
You didn't?

199
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,710
It was too noisy to hear?

200
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,970
Pete,do you have anything? Five minutes.

201
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,100
Nothing here.

202
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,960
- Harvey?
- No questions.

203
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,420
- Eric?
- I'm good.

204
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,200
- Russ,any questions?
- Nothing.

205
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,890
Mrs. Florrick?

206
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:33,670
Ronnie,Officer Zimmerman
said that there was

207
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,030
an express train running
on the facing track,

208
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,040
and he thought that's why
you and your dad didn't hear--

209
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,110
is that what happened?

210
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:46,390
I know it's tough to be here,I know.

211
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:51,140
But this is about your dad,so...

212
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,820
tell me,just me.

213
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,630
Is that what happened?

214
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,510
No.

215
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,480
That's not why you didn't hear?

216
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,560
Then why didn't you?

217
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,090
Because...they didn't say anything.

218
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,670
The undercover officers
didn't say anything?

219
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,100
But you wouldn't have heard,anyway.

220
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,650
Because of the passing train.

221
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,270
No,no.

222
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,380
You could hear everything.

223
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,160
There wasn't any noise.

224
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,470
Except the passing train.

225
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,430
There was a train that stopped.

226
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,250
It blocked out the sound,but the cops...

227
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,100
the cops didn't say a thing.

228
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,020
They just...

229
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,870
My dad...

230
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,960
he went over to help...

231
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:52,050
and they shot him.

232
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,390
They killed him.

233
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,670
And no one...

234
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:03,200
no one wants to believe me.

235
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,690
See you tomorrow.

236
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,560
Mrs. Florrick.

237
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,340
Your Honor.

238
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,690
I'm out of the robes so just Pete here.

239
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,360
You don't need to impress us.

240
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,810
I don't?

241
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,350
You're here.You have
a seat at the table.

242
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,180
That's impressing us enough.

243
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,160
You don't need to be clever.

244
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,570
I didn't think I was.

245
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,650
Your questioning.

246
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:34,250
Everybody new to the panel thinks
they're gonna reinvent the wheel.

247
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,610
You don't have to.

248
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,290
It's a wheel,it works fine.

249

<i>For Sale</i>

253
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,230
Sorry I'm late.

254
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,500
You didn't need me in there?

255
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,990
No.It went pretty fast.They said,"no."

256
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,800
They want the asking price.

257
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,840
Did you tell them I could
offer a quick closing date?

258
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,780
Yeah.They wouldn't budge.

259
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,480
I can't do higher.

260
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,930
I can't do the down payment.

261
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,810
There's something you can
try.It sometimes works.

262
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:34,650
What's that?

263
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:35,810
You can write a letter.

264
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,920
Personal stationery,handwrite it.

265
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,350
Tell her what it would
mean to move back in.

266
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,300
- Her?
- Gilda,the wife.

267
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,680
I think she's the one
making the decisions.

268
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:47,500
You have an advantage over the
other offers; You lived here.

269
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,180
What the house means to me.

270
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,090
So,Officer Coffey,what happened next?

271
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,590
I heard my partner yell,"gun."

272
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,230
I spun around and saw
a man charging at us.

273
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,120
And that's why you fired?

274
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,370
Yes,sir.

275
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,500
Thank you,ma'am.I'm finished.

276
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,960
Pastor Damon,five minutes.

277
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,710
No.I'm,I'm fine.

278
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,570
- Judge Dunaway?
- Nohing from me,Mike.

279
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,880
- Russ?
- Nothing.

280
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,490
- Eric?
- No questions.

281
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,860
Mrs. Florrick? Five minutes?

282
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,220
Yes,thank you.

283
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,020
You remember yelling
you were police officers

284
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,780
when you threw the
arrestee to the ground?

285
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,380
Yes,ma'am.

286
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,630
And you remember an express train racing

287
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,920
through the station
when you yelled "police"?

288
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,030
Yes,ma'am,that's why the
victim didn't hear us.

289
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,600
Was there a stopped train on your track?

290
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,630
Yes,ma'am,the 11:35 red line.

291
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:01,310
So...didn't it block out the
noise of the passing train?

292
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,260
I-I don't understand,ma'am.

293
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:07,560
Didn't the parked train block
the noise of the passing train?

294
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:08,620
No.

295
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,960
That's odd.

296
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,220
Because I was there last
night and I could hear...

297
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,270
- Wait a minute...
- Mrs. Florrick.

298
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,650
Yes?

299
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,110
That is not your position.

300
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:23,690
Let's move this panel into
executive session,please.

301
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,970
Officer Coffey,we'll call
you back in a few minutes.

302
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,610
I wasn't there to investigate.

303
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,090
You just happened to be in that
particular station last night?

304
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,060
Yes.

305
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:36,210
Mr. Chairman,I move that the
panel censure Mrs. Florrick.

306
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,930
- Second.
- Excuse me.

307
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,230
I'm not sure what I've done wrong.

308
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,460
You went out and investigated.

309
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,990
- I was there,I observed.
- Don't interrupt me.

310
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,030
We are like a jury.A
jury can't investigate.

311
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,860
- We're not the cops,honey.
- It's true,Mrs. Florrick.

312
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:51,120
There's nothing in the rules exactly
preventing us from investigating,

313
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,350
but it's traditional that our
review stick to the evidence on hand.

314
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,080
I didn't know that.

315
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,930
As you know,am new to this.

316
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,580
Good.

317
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,280
Well,I would advise against a censure.

318
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,010
But,now that we're all on the
same page,shall we break for lunch?

319
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,270
I am so sorry.

320
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,250
I was held up.

321
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,700
I'm sorry,Ms. Sharma.

322
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,350
That's quite all right,Mrs. Florrick.

323
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,470
It gave us time to get acquainted.

324
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,930
Mr. Lesher,is it?

325
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,340
Yes.

326
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,840
This is Mr. Finerman and Mr. Hark.

327
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:28,660
Welcome to the Internal Revenue Service.

328
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,080
We've been reviewing your petition
for an Offer and Compromise.

329
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,380
I'm afraid we need more information.

330
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:35,810
Okay,uh,well,why don't you tell us
in greater detail what it is you need,

331
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,720
and we'll be glad to supply it.

332
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,450
The exact names of Ms. Sharma's employers
and the nature of the employment.

333
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,500
Actually,that is in our petition.

334
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,780
I have more copies,if you need them.

335
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:46,590
No,no,no.We reviewed it.It's very vague.

336
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:50,300
Employment is listed as
"research" or "background check."

337
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,690
We need more specifics.

338
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,230
Why?

339
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,020
Why do we need more specifics?

340
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,460
Yes.

341
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,390
I don't think we need to explain that.

342
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,790
Ms. Sharma is not being accused of

343
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,680
breaking any laws or
exploiting any loopholes.

344
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,780
She was a passive recipient of a check

345
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,210
that you believe came from
a dummy account,that's all.

346
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:10,140
That does not open her up
to a fishing expedition.

347
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,030
Now we have come here in good
faith to Offer and Compromise.

348
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,330
We did not come here to be
shaken down for more information.

349
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:19,050
We are not in the
business of shaking down,

350
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:22,410
but we need more specific
information as to the exact nature...

351
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:23,410
What was that about?

352
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,040
Why even call us in if they
weren't gonna Offer and Compromise?

353
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,410
You got a little hot in there.

354
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,110
I did.I seem to be banging my head
against the bureaucratic wall today,

355
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,370
and I don't like my time
wasted in pointless meetings.

356
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,210
Alicia,that wasn't the meeting.

357
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,060
It wasn't? What do you mean?

358
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,670
The laptop on the desk--
someone was watching us.

359
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,470
- Who?
- I have no idea,but...

360
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,380
they want something from me.

361
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,200
If you want something
from us,you call my office.

362
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,830
Stop playing through intermediaries.

363
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,680
I lost my house.I'm using it.

364
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:16,320
Dear Gilda,As you probably know...

365
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:21,090
I lived in your house before you.

366
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,660
I saw my children grow up there.

367
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,850
I saw...

368
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:41,090
I'm gonna get you! I'm gonna get you!

369
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,680
I saw my daughter walk
for the first time there.

370
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,290
I saw...

371
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:01,140
Florrick refused to address
troubling allegations that

372
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:04,790
he abused his office in order
to protect his powerful friends.

373
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,290
Florrick denied that
he accepted sexual...

374
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,580
What are you saying?

375
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,720
What I'm saying is that
was a charade yesterday.

376
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,330
Will knew we were gonna to strip
him of his profit participation,

377
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,380
and they made it look like a struggle.

378
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,330
To what end?

379
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,210
To throw us a bone.

380
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,460
So Will can stay in his
seat as name partner.

381
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,440
This is like everything
else: it's about power.

382
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,560
And we are making it easy on them.

383
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,670
Okay.I'm listening.

384
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,430
You want Will's seat,

385
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:56,020
David Lee wants Will's
seat,and I want Will's seat.

386
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:59,070
One of us has to give,or they
benefit from our squabble.

387
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:02,420
Then give.I already
asked you to vote for me.

388
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,970
We flip a coin.

389
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,980
I win,you get your votes to support me.

390
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:09,200
- You win...
- I get your votes.

391
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,820
- Honor among thieves.
- Heads.

392
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,950
Hey,Howard.

393
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,500
I can't understand why I
can't get the corner office.

394
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,340
It's the closest one to the bathroom.

395
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,280
I don't decide that.

396
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,460
You'll have to talk to Diane.

397
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,010
Whatever happened to seniority?

398
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,350
You on the Cuesta case?

399
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,650
Am I?

400
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,990
No,I'm suspended.I'm not on any case.

401
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,130
that's right.Just you and me.

402
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,000
We're the only ones not working.

403
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,810
You got any good porn sites?

404
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,150
I'm the IPRA investigator,Forrest Burke.

405
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,730
We've read your report,Mr. Burke,

406
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,560
arguing that the allegation's not
supported by sufficient evidence.

407
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,090
There have been questions
here about the,um,

408
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,650
the noise factor on the platform.

409
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:03,960
Could you speak to that?

410
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,680
Well,I would expect some dispute.

411
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,040
This was an encounter
that lasted eight seconds.

412
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:12,140
And I've found that people experience
sound and sight radically differently

413
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,070
when there are chaotic conditions.

414
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,440
Nothing further from me,Mike.

415
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,000
Harvey,anything?

416
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,240
Why don't we just jump
right down to Mrs. Florrick?

417
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,310
See if she has anything.

418
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,600
Yes.Thank you.Just a few questions.

419
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,850
This gun the Good Samaritan had...

420
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,060
A ColtDouble Eagle Commander pistol.

421
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:28,770
Yes.

422
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,440
I saw in your report
that you checked to see

423
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,970
if it had been used in other crimes.

424
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,110
Yes,it's standard.

425
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,640
And it had been used in another crime.

426
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,930
Or,at least,the ballistics matched.

427
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:39,890
Yes.There was a jewelry store
robbery two years earlier.

428
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,120
The culprit was never apprehended,

429
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,590
but he or she did fire off one round,

430
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,800
and the recovered
shell matched this gun.

431
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,650
And you didn'tsuspect
the Good Samaritan?

432
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,150
No.Guns get bought and sold
on the street all the time.

433
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:54,900
So,this jewelry store hold
up from two years earlier,

434
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,320
did you take note of who the
supervising officer was at the scene?

435
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,880
Did I take note?

436
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,630
No.Why?

437
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:05,580
Officer Zimmerman,the undercover
officer was the supervising cop...

438
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,590
Mrs. Florrick,that is out of line.

439
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,380
- What?
- I don't get it.

440
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,860
I justfind it curious.

441
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,460
You're suggesting that
the gun was a drop gun.

442
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:15,270
That Officer Zimmerman retrieved it from
the jewelry robbery and planted it...

443
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:17,160
I'm merely asking a question.

444
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,030
In your review,did you look...

445
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,840
Mrs. Florrick,your five minutes are up.

446
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:21,750
They're...

447
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,890
Excuse me,but I spent two
of those minutes arguing.

448
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,790
That was your choice.Let's move on.

449
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,020
Harvey,you've got five
minutes.Any questions?

450
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:29,990
I do not.

451
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,780
- Mr. Adams?
- Nothing here.

452
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,030
- Mr. Danforth?
- I'm good,Mike.

453
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:36,080
Pastor Damon,any questions?

454
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,500
No,thank you.

455
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,330
But...

456
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:42,600
I'm giving my five
minutes to Mrs. Florrick.

457
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,620
- What? You can't...
- We've done it before.

458
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:48,990
I'm giving my five
minutes to Mrs. Florrick.

459
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,710
Please continue,ma'am.

460
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,500
Have there been other times where
officers have used drop guns?

461
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,020
Do you know how
ridiculous that is--

462
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,090
a cop would hold onto
that gun for two years?

463
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,130
- I'm just asking a question.
- No,you're not.

464
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,710
Let's not play innocent,Mrs. Florrick.

465
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,630
You're trying to turn
this into something.

466
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:10,830
No,I'm trying to find out...

467
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,530
This blows up into a race
riot,and it's on your head.

468
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,650
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

469
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,990
White officer,a black
victim-- come on.

470
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,280
That should have
nothing to do with this.

471
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:21,860
And yet it does.

472
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,210
Race is here.

473
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,510
And you want to kick that hornet's nest?

474
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:30,000
Ask Diane what it looks like
to piss off judges like this.

475
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:32,590
People like this.

476
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:43,590
<i>Dear Gilda</i>

477
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:53,270
Dear Gilda,I didn't know
how to write this letter

478
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:55,350
till I went to your open house.

479
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,340
See? Look at that.

480
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,880
Now you're a movie star.

481
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,830
Grace Florrick,big Hollywood movie star.

482
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:14,440
Cool!

483
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,500
look at this.

484
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,060
It's Grace Kelly.

485
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:20,210
I should have got you to
do this a long time ago.

486
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,540
Yeah,you just like me dirty and sweaty!

487
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,800
No!

488
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,990
Listen to me.

489
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,050
People are going to say a
lot of things about your dad.

490
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:43,960
Are they true?

491
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,160
Doesn't matter if they're true.

492
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,290
Does to me.It does to Mom.

493
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,140
Okay,your dad loves you.

494
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,780
He loves you so much.

495
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:55,880
But whatever you have to say
about your dad,you say it here.

496
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:01,600
Now,to me.You don't say
it to anyone else,okay?

497
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:12,140
See? Isn't this better than camping?

498
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,610
You're such a Girl Scout.

499
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,580
Yes,I am.

500
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,240
But you're still going
to have to protect me.

501
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,240
I'm so scared of lightning.

502
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,550
- Wait.Did hear that?
- What?

503
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,800
Not funny.

504
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,060
Not funny.

505
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:35,990
I know you have no reason to
choose my offer over others,

506
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:38,660
but just know you will
not find a more grateful

507
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,250
or loving occupant of your house.

508
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,020
- He said that?
- Yes.

509
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:51,370
He said there would be
consequences for questioning more.

510
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:55,060
Yeah,it sounds like Mike confusing
his carrots with his sticks.

511
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,090
But you've been
investigating on your own?

512
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,180
Who told you?

513
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,220
Who told me you were investigating?

514
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,480
Someone on the panel.

515
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,080
But that's confidential.They
broke confidentiality.

516
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,900
So have you,by relating
your conversation with Mike.

517
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,990
No.That was after the session was over.

518
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,250
Look,you want to know what to do?

519
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,840
You're on the blue ribbon panel
to review the investigation.

520
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:15,230
That's what you do.You
don't pull punches.

521
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,770
Well,it's up to you.

522
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,320
I mean,you have a seat at the table.

523
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:24,300
That means more responsibility
and consequences.

524
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,600
Can they hurt your career?

525
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,920
Yes.

526
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,020
You have to weigh that.

527
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,380
Okay.Thank you.

528
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,470
Would you like me to close the door?

529
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,170
Yes.

530
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,310
So they're going to tax us?

531
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,650
Yep.Judges Dunaway and Winter.

532
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:49,040
We have two cases in front of them.

533
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,310
Well,you put her on the panel.

534
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,730
Alicia has to do her best.

535
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,490
It's easy to be idealistic
on the sidelines,isn't it?

536
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:59,200
Yeah,that's me--
Peace Prize material.

537
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,890
And,uh,you seem to have a new friend.

538
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,340
Yeah.

539
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,180
Early bird special.

540
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:07,860
He turned me on to it.

541
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,480
It's quite a deal.

542
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,010
Hello?

543
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,170
Lana Delaney.

544
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:18,990
I'm with the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

545
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,870
You suggested I contact you.

546
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,320
"Stop playing through intermediaries."

547
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,630
Oh,right.

548
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:32,520
I thought you would call first.

549
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,030
Yes,I thought I would,too.

550
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:36,040
Then I decided against it.

551
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,380
So...Kalinda?

552
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:42,450
Yes,Kalinda.What is the
nature of this investigation?

553
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,980
I don't know.

554
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,390
You don't know?

555
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,750
Yes.

556
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,450
Sometimes I just get an itch.

557
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:54,140
Okay,so I'm,um...

558
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:56,550
I'm sorry.What was your name again?

559
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,150
Lana Delaney.

560
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:02,450
You guys represent
Lemond Bishop,don't you?

561
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,510
So that's what this is
about-- Lemond Bishop?

562
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,590
No.I'm just asking a question.

563
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,410
Yes,we represent him.

564
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,040
And has Kalinda Sharma ever
done freelance work for him?

565
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,920
Do you have proof that she has?

566
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,620
How long have you known Kalinda?

567
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,470
- Why?
- Just curious.

568
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,450
You're friends,aren't you?

569
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:30,560
You know,I think you should
call first,Ms. Delaney,

570
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:34,060
the next time you want
to drop by my office.

571
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,390
Then we can get
everything on the record.

572
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,000
Okay.

573
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:42,960
Tell Kalinda hi for me.

574
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,220
- Mr. Burke?
- Mrs. Florrick,uh,hello.

575
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,100
I'm sorry to come here
without an appointment.

576
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,720
just a sec.I'm sorry,Mr. Burke.

577
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,910
Hello?

578
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:04,060
My gosh,what an amazing
letter.I was crying!

579
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,260
- Gilda?
- Yes.Tears!

580
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,630
It had me bawling.

581
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:10,240
I remember my first house.It
was exactly like that.

582
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,880
Kalinda,wait a sec.I'm
so sorry,Mr. Burke.

583
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:13,370
I just don't have that much
time.I'm on lunch break.

584
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,420
Of course,we'll consider
your offer,Mrs. Florrick.

585
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,230
- thank you.
- I have two kids,too.

586
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:22,200
I come from a big family,and I
always told myself,"Listen to moms."

587
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,510
I'm so glad,because I wasn't...

588
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,630
I wasn't sure I was doing the right
thing by writing the letter and...

589
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,100
Kalinda,the FBI was here for you.

590
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,920
- For me? Who?
- Agent Delaney.

591
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,490
It was definitely the right thing to do.

592
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,700
In fact,I want you to know
we have a bigger offer--

593
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,280
someone who offered
our asking price--

594
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,390
but I'd rather you have the house.

595
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,480
Oh,I...well,I'm so
thrilled to hear that.

596
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:42,440
Mrs. Florrick.

597
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,240
I checked the drop gun.I
checked what you mentioned.

598
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,060
So we're giving you a
chance to top their offer.

599
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,360
Not even by that much; Just a little.

600
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,040
What?

601
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,780
We so want you to have the house.

602
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,510
We just need you to
top the offer we have.

603
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,960
Okay.Thank you.

604
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,540
So we'll expect your call?

605
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:00,310
Yep.Good-bye.

606
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,830
What did you need,Mr. Burke?

607
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:09,430
And with that,I think we have heard
the lion's share of the evidence,

608
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,020
so unless there are any more motions...

609
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,240
There is one,sir--
Mr. Chair.

610
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:16,300
I move that we recall
Investigator Forrest Burke.

611
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,960
We've already heard
from him,Mrs. Florrick.

612
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:21,460
Yes,but it is my understanding
that he has new evidence.

613
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,640
Really?

614
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:24,760
And how did it become
your understanding?

615
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,670
He came to my workplace.

616
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:30,580
He said the chair rejected his
request to testify here again.

617
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:37,110
First of all,Mrs. Florrick,you
are far out of line here.

618
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,640
In fact,I don't even
think there is a line...

619
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,240
But is it true?

620
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:42,030
Mr. Burke did come to me and
asked if we needed more from him,

621
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,350
and I said we did not.

622
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,080
He discovered Officer Zimmerman

623
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:47,760
took a gun from the jewelry
story robbery into evidence,

624
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:48,960
but never inventoried it.

625
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,780
Mrs. Florrick,that is
not yours to assert.

626
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,110
Correct.

627
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:52,900
It is Mr. Burke's.

628
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,550
We have heard enough from Mr. Burke.

629
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,750
I move that we recall.

630
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:02,720
Okay,fine.That's the
way we do things here.

631
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,210
All those in favor of Mrs.
Florrick's motion to recall Mr. Burke,

632
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,310
please signify by saying,"Aye."

633
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:09,770
Aye.

634
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,690
Aye.

635
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,110
Five to two.

636
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,280
Unfortunately,you need a majority.

637
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,010
Aye.

638
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,870
I'm here to determine the truth.

639
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:25,820
I can't do that unless
I listen to everything.

640
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:27,960
Aye.

641
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,800
Aye.

642
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,440
I'm not bitter.

643
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,940
Bitterness is for losers.

644
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:40,840
You tell me-- why should I
give someone else a leg up,huh?

645
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,110
- I see you're busy here.
- No,no.

646
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,240
David,what do you need?
Howard,do you mind?

647
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,400
Sure.Push me here,push me there.

648
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,690
Right.Take two steps that way.

649
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,500
Sorry to interrupt your schmoozing,

650
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:55,560
but do you know that Diane
is digging this firm's grave

651
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,650
because of her loyalty to you?

652
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:59,330
No.I didn't know that.

653
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,090
Will,I always liked you.

654
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,460
I thought you were smart.

655
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,600
But this firm is not
owned by you or Diane,

656
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:08,200
and she is treating it like it is.

657
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:11,610
She's not making smart
business or legal decisions.

658
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:14,000
And what are the smart decisions?

659
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,790
She needs help at the top.

660
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:20,820
She is overwhelmed,and she can't ask for
help because she's holding the spot for you.

661
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:26,380
You want me to support
you to replace me?

662
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:27,170
No.

663
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:33,060
I want you to tell Diane to make
smart decisions not based on loyalty.

664
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,020
Hello?

665
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,400
Alicia,I'm so thrilled.

666
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,930
But why didn't you go through me?

667
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,730
Hi,Marina.What?

668
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,410
Why didn't you do the
sales contract through me?

669
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,280
What sales contract?

670
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,210
For the house.I saw it cross my desk.

671
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:59,020
But why did you use Shirley?

672
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,350
I didn't.

673
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:02,630
I didn't get the house.I
couldn't beat the offer.

674
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,020
Well,I'm looking at the file right here.

675
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,170
"Florrick." I mean,how
many Florricks are there?

676
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,920
Two.

677
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,870
Two Florricks.

678
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:18,650
Oh,I see-- your
husband.That's great.

679
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,780
You got the house.Congratulations.

680
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:24,560
Alicia? Hello?

681
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:31,730
Why are you doing this?

682
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,100
Doing what?

683
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,000
Holding my seat for me.

684
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,290
Do you want me not to?

685
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,670
I don't want you holding my seat out
of some misguided sense of loyalty.

686
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:41,970
Well,you'd do the same.

687
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,300
No,I wouldn't.

688
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:46,270
No,you would,because it's smart.

689
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:49,360
David Lee,Julius and Eli are children

690
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,560
who have been told
they can't have a toy,

691
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,160
which makes them want it even more.

692
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,360
But if they got it,they
would just break it,

693
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,330
which is why we have to
keep it out of their reach.

694
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:02,550
Good.

695
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:05,010
As long as you're doing
it because it's smart.

696
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,810
Always.

697
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:10,030
I think Julius is
joining forces with Eli.

698
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:13,750
Yes,they've requested another
partner vote.Any ideas?

699
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:18,410
- One.
- Really? Well,let's hear it.

700
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:20,870
Peter,when you get
this,can you call my cell?

701
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,300
I need to talk to you about
something as soon as you can.

702
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:29,870
I just wish,if accusations of a drop
gun were made,they'd be made to my face.

703
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,710
I wouldn't say they've risen
to the level of accusations.

704
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,920
They're just...provocative questions.

705
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:39,650
Now,you were questioned about
a drop gun,weren't you,Officer?

706
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,750
- Yes.
- And when was that?

707
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:46,260
After the IPRA investigation,I was
questioned by the State's Attorney's office.

708
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:50,600
By whom... in the
State's Attorney's office?

709
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:54,420
ASA Matan Brody and
Deputy ASA Cary Agos.

710
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:57,270
And they decided not to prosecute?

711
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:00,540
Yes,they took their findings to
the State's Attorney,Peter Florrick,

712
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:03,320
and he decided there
wasn't enough to prosecute.

713
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,500
But you could see why I would
take these charges of a gun drop

714
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:07,810
with some sense of outrage.

715
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,300
Of course you wanted him back.

716
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,840
So you could lay this at 
the feet of my husband,

717
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,160
and I would have to recuse myself.

718
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,960
Oh,no,you're not going
to recuse yourself.

719
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,440
In fact,I move this
panel deny any recusal.

720
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:19,540
Mrs. Florrick,this is not about you.

721
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,140
Your questions have woken
up this panel to its duty.

722
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,170
We're just following the
evidence where it takes us,

723
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:28,210
and if it takes us to an inappropriate
decision in the State's Attorney's office,

724
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,100
so be it.

725
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:32,570
I move that we call the ASAs
who questioned Officer Zimmerman.

726
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,670
There you are.

727
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,950
Here I am.

728
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,050
Oh,you wanted to get my attention.

729
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,890
I don't want you to get
the wrong idea,Kalinda.

730
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:54,690
The IRS caught your
little freelance problem.

731
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,920
I just picked up the ball.

732
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:01,060
And where are you carrying this...ball?

733
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,520
Let's have dinner,and we can talk.

734
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,650
No.Let's talk here.

735
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:10,500
No,it's too crowded here.

736
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,420
I know a nice,intimate
restaurant off Lincoln.

737
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:18,060
Why don't we do intimate here?

738
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,690
Kalinda,I asked you
to join me at the FBI.

739
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,390
You wouldn't be having any problems now,

740
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:28,040
but you decided to stick
it out at Lockhart/Gardner.

741
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,930
Kalinda!

742
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,720
You have such pretty lips.

743
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:34,740
What are you doing?

744
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:37,660
Why do we have to wait
till dinner? Why not here?

745
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:39,640
- Kalinda.
- What's wrong?

746
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,590
Kiss me.

747
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:47,190
Okay,just so you know,this is not
the way you handle this meeting.

748
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,220
And just so you know,if you
want to talk about business,

749
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,180
let's talk about business.

750
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:57,310
If you want to talk about something
else,we can talk about something else.

751
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:59,370
Just don't mix the two.

752
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:17,680
Yes,we interviewed Officers
Zimmerman and Coffey two weeks ago?

753
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,990
And you asked them about the
possibility of a drop gun?

754
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,000
Yes.

755
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:25,950
We discovered that Officer Zimmerman had
been present at an earlier crime scene

756
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,970
where no gun had been
recovered and inventoried.

757
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,240
And the worry was that Officer
Zimmerman had taken the gun

758
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:34,380
into his own possession
and never inventoried it?

759
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:34,880
Yes.

760
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:38,240
But you didn't go any further
with these accusations?

761
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,210
No.

762
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:42,880
after consulting with
the State's Attorney...

763
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,860
Peter Florrick?

764
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:45,940
Yes.

765
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,630
After consulting,we decided that this
was probably an unfortunate coincidence.

766
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,320
Did the racial makeup of
the officers and the victim

767
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:55,370
enter into this decision at all?

768
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,610
Not in my decision.

769
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,860
No.The State's Attorney's decision?

770
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:00,840
I can't answer that.

771
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,230
Why?

772
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,300
Well,because I don't know,Your Honor.

773
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:07,010
But it would not be in the interest
of the State's Attorney to pursue

774
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:11,520
a racially-charged prosecutionon the eve
of his announcement for a run for governor?

775
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,590
I can't answer that,but
I can be offended by that.

776
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,550
Who else was in the
meeting,Deputy ASA Agos?

777
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:19,580
just to correct you,I'm
no longer a deputy.

778
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,710
I've been demoted.

779
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,110
I'm sorry to hear that.

780
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,980
Who else was in the meeting

781
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:27,370
when you consulted on not
pursuing the drop gun evidence?

782
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,040
Who else?

783
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,970
Myself and the State's Attorney.

784
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:31,630
Anyone else?

785
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,230
Yes.

786
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,990
And who was that?

787
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:41,080
Mr. Eli Gold.

788
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,570
And who is that?

789
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:45,380
I believe he's a crisis consultant.

790
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,450
And at one point,Peter
Florrick's campaign manager?

791
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,590
Yes.

792
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:55,060
I think she was a
teacher when I was there.

793
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,820
She must be,what,about 90?

794
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:59,480
She's 95.She just had her birthday.

795
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:02,190
Is that Mom?

796
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,640
Mom!

797
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:07,560
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.I'll be right back.

798
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,920
Well,your ice cream's going to melt.

799
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,450
You didn't return my calls.

800
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,250
- I know.
- That's not fair.

801
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:20,050
I didn't think it would be
a good idea if we talked.

802
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,290
Well,we're talking now because...

803
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,060
Peter,this is wrong.

804
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:24,950
We're fine.

805
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,410
No,we're not.

806
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:29,320
They have to do what they have to do.

807
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,410
What are you talking about?

808
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,250
It's confidential.

809
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:35,020
If you warned me about the panel,you'd
be breaking confidentiality.

810
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,010
You...I...

811
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,490
That's not why I was calling.

812
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,260
You didn't call me back.Why?

813
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,900
Because I didn't want you
to break confidentiality.

814
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:46,570
This is about you buying the
house.That's why I was calling.

815
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,130
What house?

816
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:50,740
Our old house-- you put
a down payment on it?

817
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:52,630
No.

818
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:56,230
The sales contract has your name on it.

819
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,200
Alicia,I don't know what
you're talking about.

820
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,710
Is our house for sale?

821
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,940
- There's another Florrick.
- What?!

822
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,400
It's not just you and
me.There's another Florrick.

823
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,690
Jackie.

824
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,340
Oh,my God.

825
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,500
Jackie bought the house.

826
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,700
What are you talking about?

827
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,430
- I got to go.
- Wait a minute.Where are you going?

828
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,080
To buy a gun.

829
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,930
could I just speak for a minute?

830
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:31,040
Now,I have made no secret of my interest
in stepping into a name partner role,

831
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:33,210
mostly because I believe the firm,

832
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,260
and our bottom lines,are hurt...

833
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,740
Is this going to take long?

834
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,780
Only if it irritates you.

835
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,790
But I have decided,after
much reflection,

836
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:44,820
to support Julius
Cain as a name partner,

837
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:48,800
because I feel he will best
exemplify,um,the things...

838
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:50,880
that we want.

839
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,200
Thank you,Eli.

840
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:55,560
And,uh,I would like to applaud
you for that selfless act.

841
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,140
come on.You flipped a coin or something.

842
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,480
So I would urge the equity partners

843
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:03,870
who supported me in the last
vote to now support Julius...

844
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,250
Point of information,Madame Chair.

845
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,040
What does that even mean?

846
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,000
It means,they can do whatever they want.

847
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:08,580
Granted.

848
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,070
I think one person is being
overlooked in this rush

849
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:13,950
to replace me as name
partner during my suspension.

850
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,480
There is one person in this room

851
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:20,250
who has the most seniority
and institutional memory

852
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,840
to lead us into these
difficult economic times.

853
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,180
I have the most seniority here.

854
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,980
No,David,you don't.

855
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:28,220
Howard,do you mind standing

856
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,260
Yeah,okay.

857
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,210
Oh,dear God,you're kidding.

858
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:33,370
You can't be serious.

859
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:34,070
Who is that?

860
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:37,200
Howard,would you be willing to step up and
help Diane during these difficult times?

861
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:39,730
If I get the corner office
closest to the restroom.

862
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:42,100
Is that a motion to replace
Will with Howard Lyman?

863
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,160
- Yes.
- Do I have a second?

864
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:43,910
Second.

865
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,370
All in favor?

866
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:47,530
- what about debate?
- It's too late.

867
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,230
We're now turning to a vote.

868
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:53,140
It's all come down to this.

869
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:54,360
Yup.

870
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,110
You seem distracted.

871
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,090
I am headed somewhere after this.

872
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,470
I'll get right to the point then.

873
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:01,430
There are two reports I can write.

874
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:04,630
One says that there was nothing
unusual about this shooting.

875
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,400
The police behaved admirably,the
victim behaved recklessly,

876
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,780
and this was all just
an unfortunate accident.

877
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:11,610
In other words,a lie?

878
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:14,120
Well,let's just say,a compromise.

879
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:17,470
Second report mentions the
possibility of a drop gun,

880
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,860
the business with the
noise on the platform,

881
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:22,580
the embarrassing detail of the
State's Attorney's office ignoring

882
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:25,810
clear evidence of a drop
gun for political ends,

883
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:28,130
and the personal
involvement of your husband

884
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,840
in the events of the
potential cover-up,

885
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,420
and that will not look good for him.

886
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:35,880
And you want to know which
report I would vote for.

887
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,410
Yeah,I want it to be unanimous.

888
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,500
I want to avoid a minority report.

889
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:47,560
Very simply,the more compromised
report protects your husband.

890
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:53,070
The more,shall we say,forthcoming
report,hurts your husband.

891
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,380
Which one do you want?

892
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:01,300
Nothing's simple,is it?

893
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:03,680
Oh,that's not true.

894
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,780
Candy Land is simple.

895
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,070
I'm recusing myself.

896
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:16,840
Any way I go on this decision,I
have a conflict of interest.

897
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:18,670
Oh,that's too bad.

898
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,440
That boy pleaded with you for the truth.

899
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:25,740
His father's dead,and all he
wanted from you was the truth.

900
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,260
I'll see you again,Mrs. Florrick.

901
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,880
I doubt it.

902
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,990
He could be president.

903
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:42,620
Oh,please,stop.

904
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:44,100
What?!

905
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,380
He's handsome enough.

906
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:46,700
Certainly tall enough.

907
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,520
Peter doesn't even know
if he'll run for governor.

908
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,340
he'll run for governor.

909
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,420
I don't know.

910
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,830
He has to decide by next week.

911
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:01,110
Jacques,would-would you
just give me a second?

912
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,470
Sure.

913
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,190
Hello,Jackie.

914
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,810
Alicia.

915
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:09,440
You have a moment?

916
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:11,210
I do.
