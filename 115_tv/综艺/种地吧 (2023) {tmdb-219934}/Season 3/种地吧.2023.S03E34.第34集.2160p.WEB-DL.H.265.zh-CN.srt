Let's see how Copilot can use

11
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:35,185
your customer notes

12
00:00:35,185 --> 00:00:38,721
in OneNote as well as another internal document.

13
00:00:38,722 --> 00:00:42,192
Copilot quickly creates a first draft.

14
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:46,128
You can turn your Word document into a PowerPoint

15
00:00:46,128 --> 00:00:48,781
presentation that you can hone and polish.

16
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,585
Let's jump into Copilot in Excel.

17
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:56,121
You start by asking Copilot to analyze the data

18
00:00:56,121 --> 00:00:58,456
and give you three key trends.

19
00:00:58,457 --> 00:01:01,143
Within seconds, you’ve got what you need.

20
00:01:03,445 --> 00:01:04,797
Triage your inbox,

21
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:09,352
highlighting the most important emails to prioritize.

22
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:11,671
You can draft a reply

23
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:13,522
using data from an Excel file

24
00:01:13,522 --> 00:01:17,359
and Copilot will generate a reply for you.

25
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:18,727
The real magic of Copilot

26
00:01:18,727 --> 00:01:21,296
happens during a live meeting.

27
00:01:21,296 --> 00:01:22,648
You can ask Copilot to

28
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,534
summarize what’s happened so far.

29
00:01:24,534 --> 00:01:27,170
You can see who said what, what points were made.

30
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,121
You can follow a meeting and catch up

31
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:32,991
to see what you missed, even if you can’t attend.

32
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:34,661
I want to show you an entirely

33
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,745
new standalone experience.

34
00:01:36,745 --> 00:01:40,398

35
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,802

36
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:46,506
and more to turn all your data into knowledge.

37
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:52,261
Now let's imagine you're

38
00:01:52,262 --> 00:01:53,996
 working on your business strategy.

39
00:01:53,996 --> 00:01:56,782
You ask Copilot to pull up quarterly projections

40
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,402
and identify related risks.

41
00:01:59,402 --> 00:02:02,754
Copilot gives you key data points and flags

42
00:02:02,754 --> 00:02:04,490
