00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,570
Hello,

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,910
I just came back from work

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,150
and then I simply went to
my neighborhood noodle restaurant

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,350
and ate a bowl of noodles

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,250
and then I bought some fruit to take home

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,470
so now I am in a place

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,910
where I can just

8
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,840
take a rest and
washed a little strawberry here.

9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,370
I'm not particularly busy today, so I'm in

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,730
a good mood.

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,660
Relaxed and smooth.

12
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,910
In fact

13
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,010
in the past month, my life and work

14
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,410
have begun to get on the right track

15
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,470
so I have tried

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,990
my best to keep my life and work

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,990
in a relatively stable state,

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,830
rather than in a endless tense state.

19
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,080
So in fact

20
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,240
this month, I am not that tired as before

21
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,330
And then, for me

22
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,110
On weekends, I will go outdoors to relax.

23
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,430
There are

24
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,470
several weekends
when I don't have a job at all.

25
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,750
It does not mean
 I wanted to do extra work

26
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,360
Also, in Beijing

27
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:18,760
the spring is coming.

28
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,650
So I like to go out for a walk

29
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,200
with my friends,

30
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,240
and go to the park

31
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,630
especially on sunny days.

32
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,350
So in fact

33
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,390
we often appreciate the flowers in the park

34
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,950
and then chat, so as to relax

35
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,710
Besides, in fact,

36
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,710
I think my favorite way to relax is

37
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,450
to be alone.

38
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,880
I live alone to make me relax.

39
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:51,230
For example,when I am at home

40
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,510
I may like to listen to podcasts quietly

41
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,830
or listen to podcasts

42
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,390
when I take a shower
