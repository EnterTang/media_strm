1
00:00:01,051 --> 00:00:02,991
《貓鼠遊戲》  前情提要
Previously on White Collar

2
00:00:02,991 --> 00:00:04,361
我打開了彼得的保險櫃
I broke into Peter's safe.

3
00:00:04,361 --> 00:00:05,491
清單就在我手裡
I had the list in my hand.

4
00:00:05,491 --> 00:00:07,331
我本打算帶著寶藏遠走高飛
I was ready to take the treasure and go.

5
00:00:07,331 --> 00:00:08,451
那為何又改變主意
Then why didn't you?

6
00:00:08,461 --> 00:00:09,711
我在這裡有了新生活
I have a life here.

7
00:00:09,731 --> 00:00:10,611
如果我走了
I run on this,

8
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:12,321
就只能在記憶中重訪紐約了
And New York is just a memory for me.

9
00:00:12,321 --> 00:00:15,011
-他偷了一幅拉斐爾  -純屬猜測法官大人
- He stole a Raphael!  - Conjecture, your honor.

10
00:00:15,011 --> 00:00:15,871
還有  我是"追查"你
And I pursued.

11
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:17,851
這幅拉斐爾我可沒忘
And I haven't forgotten about the Raphael.

12
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:19,811
尼爾的信件裡有密碼
Neal coded his letters.

13
00:00:19,841 --> 00:00:20,941
我們破譯了
And we cracked it.

14
00:00:21,551 --> 00:00:23,741
還不知道是什麼意思  不過會查到的
Don't know what they mean yet, but we will.

15
00:00:24,251 --> 00:00:25,411
-我是...  -克雷默探員
- I'm --  - Agent Kramer.

16
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:27,101
華盛頓藝品犯罪科主管
Head of the bureau's D.C. Art Crimes Unit.

17
00:00:27,101 --> 00:00:29,371
這麼說彼得的能耐都是跟您學的
So you're the one who taught Peter everything he knows.

18
00:00:29,371 --> 00:00:32,161
你我相見是早晚的事  卡夫瑞先生
I'd say this moment was inevitable, Mr. Caffrey.

19
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:34,351
-尼爾是我的線人  -也是你的朋友
- Neal's my C.I.  - He's also a friend.

20
00:00:34,471 --> 00:00:36,501
你覺得騙子永遠不會悔改
You think once a con, always a con?

21
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:39,261
我認為他們遭殃時你得保護自己
I think you have to protect yourself when they fall.

22
00:00:39,971 --> 00:00:40,981
寶藏在你手裡
You have the treasure.

23
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:42,621
-我沒偷  -你個混蛋
- I didn't steal it.  - You son of a bitch!

24
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:44,381
我不管  反正在你手裡
I don't care. You have it.

25
00:00:44,721 --> 00:00:45,461
東西在哪
Where is it?

26
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:46,751
本來就在這裡
It was here.

27
00:00:46,991 --> 00:00:47,841
他把東西轉移了
He already moved it.

28
00:00:47,841 --> 00:00:49,521
蚊子  當然是他
Mozzie? Of course it was Mozzie.

29
00:00:49,521 --> 00:00:51,291
我沒想到他動作這麼快
I didn't think he'd move it this fast.

30
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:52,071
這是什麼
What is it?

31
00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:54,671
這是封來自美國緩刑局的信
This is a letter from the U.S. Probation Office.

32
00:00:54,841 --> 00:00:57,131
因為你的傑出貢獻
"Because of your outstanding service,

33
00:00:57,131 --> 00:00:58,861
包括奪回寶藏
"Including recovering the treasure

34
00:00:58,861 --> 00:01:00,051
抓捕凱勒歸案
"and catching Keller,

35
00:01:00,471 --> 00:01:03,221
美國緩刑局將召開一次聽證會
"The U.S. Probation office is convening a hearing

36
00:01:03,221 --> 00:01:06,271
討論對於你的減刑事宜
to discuss the commutation of your sentence."

37
00:01:06,271 --> 00:01:07,151
這是什麼意思
What's that mean?

38
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:09,091
說明你不用戴腳環了
It means no anklet.

39
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:10,711
不再受監控
No nothing.

40
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:12,081
你就要自由了
You could be a free man.

41
00:01:17,321 --> 00:01:19,091
請正式陳述你的姓名
State your name for the record, please.

42
00:01:19,671 --> 00:01:21,351
尼爾·喬治·卡夫瑞
Neal George Caffrey.

43
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:23,931
卡夫瑞先生  你清楚今天為什麼請你來嗎
Mr. Caffrey, do you understand why you're sitting here today?

44
00:01:24,221 --> 00:01:25,161
清楚
I do.

45
00:01:25,761 --> 00:01:28,331
聯邦檢察署為我申請了第35條
The U.S. Attorney has petitioned a rule 35 motion

46
00:01:28,331 --> 00:01:30,491
假釋動議  如果獲得批准
on my behalf, which, if granted,

47
00:01:30,581 --> 00:01:33,281
將減免我的刑期  並具結釋放
would commute my sentence and set about my own recognizance.

48
00:01:33,311 --> 00:01:36,131
簡言之  你們想知道我是否有資格獲得自由
In essence, you want to know if I've earned my freedom.

49
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:38,161
看來你已經研究過了
You've done your homework.

50
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:39,591
是的  長官
Yes, ma'am.

51
00:01:40,171 --> 00:01:42,931
在四年刑期中你已經服刑兩年
You've already served two years of a four-year sentence

52
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:45,411
受到特別探員彼得·博爾克的監控
under the supervision of Special Agent Peter Burke.

53
00:01:45,411 --> 00:01:46,201
是的  長官
Yes, ma'am.

54
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:48,141
戴著追蹤腳環
While confined to a tracking anklet,

55
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:49,591
你協助博爾克探員
you've helped Agent Burke clear

56
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:52,311
取得了94%定罪率的驚人成績
an impressive 94% conviction rate.

57
00:01:53,831 --> 00:01:55,091
我們合作很棒
We work well together.

58
00:01:55,881 --> 00:01:57,101
看起來是
It would seem so.

59
00:01:58,031 --> 00:01:59,601
最近逮捕的馬修·凱勒
The recent arrest of Matthew Keller,

60
00:01:59,601 --> 00:02:01,791
是聯調局十大通緝犯之一
one of the FBI's top 10 most wanted fugitives,

61
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:04,771
並追回了一批他偷竊的珍貴藏品
the recovery of a priceless collection of artwork he stole

62
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:07,011
你真是改過自新的典型
You are the poster boy for reform.

63
00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:08,431
誰能想到呢
Who would have thought?

64
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:12,921
你作為罪犯加入了司法系統
You came into this legal system as a criminal.

65
00:02:12,921 --> 00:02:15,891
聽證會成員要弄清的問題是  你是否已改過
The question before this board today is -- have you changed?

66
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:17,311
我相信我改過了
I believe I have.

67
00:02:18,761 --> 00:02:19,801
在接下來兩天中
Over the next two days,

68
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:22,141
我們將訪談一些和你親近的熟人
we'll be interviewing some of your closest acquaintances

69
00:02:22,151 --> 00:02:22,971
以及同事
and colleagues.

70
00:02:22,971 --> 00:02:25,411
然後我們會讓你回來進行最後陳述
Then we'll have you back to make a final statement,

71
00:02:25,461 --> 00:02:26,761
屆時博爾克探員
at which time Agent Burke

72
00:02:26,761 --> 00:02:28,781
將給出總結性建議
will give his summary recommendation.

73
00:02:29,001 --> 00:02:30,021
還有問題嗎
Any questions?

74
00:02:30,071 --> 00:02:30,881
沒有了  長官
No, ma'am.

75
00:02:31,441 --> 00:02:34,781
不過我想說過去兩年是我一生
But may I say that the last two years of my life

76
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:35,521
最棒的...
have been the best --

77
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:38,171
兩天會給你足夠的時間進行陳述
You'll have time for all that two days from now.

78
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,081
是的  長官
Yes, ma'am.

79
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:40,741
令人讚歎啊  卡夫瑞先生
This is impressive, Mr. Caffrey.

80
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:44,581
希望你本人和文件中所描述的相符合
I hope the real you lives up to who you are on paper.

81
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:46,741
希望不辜負您的期望
I hope to exceed your expectation.

82
00:02:52,761 --> 00:02:53,841
你可以自由離開了
You're free to go.

83
00:02:58,931 --> 00:02:59,711
自由離開
"Free to go."

84
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:02,121
真是個鼓舞人心的短語
Quite an inspiring turn of phrase.

85
00:03:02,271 --> 00:03:04,661
不過"自由留下"對我來說更合適
Except "You're free to stay" might be more appropriate.

86
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:06,141
感覺如何
How's it looking?

87
00:03:06,141 --> 00:03:07,371
都有可能
Flip a coin.

88
00:03:08,931 --> 00:03:10,931
無論委員會如何判決
Regardless of what the committee decides,

89
00:03:11,241 --> 00:03:12,501
這裡就是我家了
this is my home now.

90
00:03:13,971 --> 00:03:15,501
而我會一直在你身邊
And I am right beside you.

91
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:19,111
在同樣的紐約開始嶄新的生活
Make a brand-new start of it in old New York.

92
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:24,491
當你重新開始時
Well, when you make that brand-new start,

93
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:25,651
我有驚喜給你
I've got a surprise.

94
00:03:25,651 --> 00:03:27,551
-什麼驚喜  -大驚喜
- What kind of surprise?  - A huge one.

95
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:30,341
能讓大犬星座都黯然失色
Makes Canis Majoris look like a night light.

96
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:32,381
不過我不會再多說
But I will say no more.

97
00:03:32,821 --> 00:03:33,981
我也不問了
I'll ask no more.

98
00:03:36,571 --> 00:03:37,541
看起來你的證人列表裡
There seems to be someone missing

99
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:40,271
少了一個人
from your commutation witness list.

100
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:41,261
抱歉
Yeah, sorry about that,

101
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:42,941
不過讓一位著名罪犯為我說話
but having a known felon speak for me

102
00:03:42,941 --> 00:03:45,321
並不能證明我的品格變好了
doesn't qualify as a good character reference.

103
00:03:45,321 --> 00:03:47,491
我是罪犯  不過是非著名
I am a felon, but I'm not known --

104
00:03:47,491 --> 00:03:49,251
至少在司法圈非著名
at least in bureaucratic circles.

105
00:03:49,251 --> 00:03:50,331
我承認
I stand corrected.

106
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:52,551
而且已經有很多人來支持我了
But I've already got plenty of people on my side.

107
00:03:52,551 --> 00:03:55,471
伊利莎白  瓊  還有莎拉
Elizabeth, June...Sara.

108
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,601
-真的  -對
- Really?  - Yeah.

109
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:59,531
很好  那兩個小探員呢
Good. What about the demi-suits?

110
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:02,151
瓊斯和戴安  萬能牌
Mm. Jones and Diana? Wild cards.

111
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:04,681
那探員叔本人呢
And the suit himself?

112
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:06,791
考慮到之前發生事情
Well, considering everything that's happened --

113
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,771
關於寶藏  關於凱勒
with the treasure, with Keller --

114
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:10,701
彼得怎麼選擇都有可能
Peter could go either way.

115
00:04:10,911 --> 00:04:12,171
你認為他決定了嗎
Think he's decided?

116
00:04:13,051 --> 00:04:14,201
我不知道
I don't know.

117
00:04:14,691 --> 00:04:15,661
等等
Hold on.

118
00:04:16,861 --> 00:04:20,401
克雷默探員  華盛頓藝品犯罪科的老爺爺
Agent Kramer, the D.C. Art Crimes grand-pere  --

119
00:04:20,401 --> 00:04:21,141
他也是證人
He's speaking?

120
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:22,981
克雷默應該只代表局裡
Kramer was supposed to submit a written report

121
00:04:22,981 --> 00:04:24,321
提交文本材料
on behalf of the bureau.

122
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:27,471
如果他親自作證  那絕不是只走程序
If he's speaking in person, that's more than a formality.

123
00:04:27,471 --> 00:04:29,001
那對你會有什麼影響
Well, what does that do to your chances?

124
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:31,121
我覺得不會有正面作用
Well, I can't imagine it improves them.

125
00:04:32,631 --> 00:04:34,981
反正最壞的情況是他不同意
You know what? Worst-case scenario, he says no,

126
00:04:34,981 --> 00:04:36,711
我繼續戴著腳環  跟著彼得
and I stay on the anklet with Peter.

127
00:04:37,221 --> 00:04:40,181
在每個最壞的情況之後
Well, behind every worst-case scenario,

128
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:43,001
通常都有更壞的情況
there's a worse worst-case scenario.

129
00:04:43,051 --> 00:04:43,901
你是不是就非得
Isn't there a child

130
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:45,451
怎麼敗興怎麼說啊
whose balloon you need to pop somewhere?

131
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,811
沒錯  消極是我的習慣
Yeah. Negativity -- force of habit.

132
00:04:47,811 --> 00:04:49,701
我想  肯定沒什麼問題
I'm...sure it doesn't mean anything.

133
00:04:50,701 --> 00:04:52,491
對  沒事
Yeah. Nothing.

134
00:04:56,941 --> 00:04:58,091
進來
Come on in.

135
00:04:58,501 --> 00:04:59,541
屋裡真香
Smells good in here.

136
00:04:59,961 --> 00:05:01,431
小伊在烘焙
Yeah. El's been baking.

137
00:05:05,581 --> 00:05:08,101
恭喜減刑

138
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:09,521
減刑慶祝蛋糕
A commutation cake.

139
00:05:09,931 --> 00:05:12,541
我告訴過她為時尚早
Yeah, I told her it was a little premature.

140
00:05:12,951 --> 00:05:14,741
親愛的  我另一個蛋糕也好了
Hey, honey. I got that other cake.

141
00:05:15,251 --> 00:05:16,451
給你看看
Wait till you see it.

142
00:05:16,921 --> 00:05:20,531
別氣餒
"Hang in there."

143
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:21,731
別氣餒

144
00:05:20,531 --> 00:05:22,071
帶著腳環的小貓
Little cat with an anklet.

145
00:05:23,191 --> 00:05:24,591
失敗安慰蛋糕
Consolation cake.

146
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,041
-朗姆酒  -放了不少
- Rum?  - Lots of Rum.

147
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,581
-那最好  -對
- That'll be good.  - Yes.

148
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:28,801
不管怎樣
Well, for what it's worth,

149
00:05:28,801 --> 00:05:30,351
我會選擇一號蛋糕
I'm actually voting for cake number one.

150
00:05:30,361 --> 00:05:31,391
謝謝
I appreciate that.

151
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:32,381
你們聊
You guys talk.

152
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:38,441
你決定了嗎
So, have you decided?

153
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:40,501
我打算怎麼說嗎  說真的
What I'm gonna say? Honestly...

154
00:05:41,401 --> 00:05:42,731
沒有  還沒決定
No. I haven't.

155
00:05:43,731 --> 00:05:46,041
什麼事重要到不能打電話
So, what's so important you couldn't call?

156
00:05:47,251 --> 00:05:49,171
為什麼克雷默會參加聽證會
Why is Kramer speaking at my hearing?

157
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:51,261
別為這個緊張
Don't let that put you on edge.

158
00:05:52,831 --> 00:05:54,641
彼得  我面前擺著兩個蛋糕
Peter, I'm staring at two cakes here.

159
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:56,021
一個表示慶祝
One celebrates my fate,

160
00:05:56,031 --> 00:05:57,501
另一個表示安慰  我當然緊張  
The other seals it -- I am on edge.

161
00:05:57,501 --> 00:05:58,151
為什麼他會發言
Why is he here?

162
00:05:58,151 --> 00:05:59,971
我不知道  不管什麼原因
I don't know. For whatever reason,

163
00:05:59,971 --> 00:06:02,821
克雷默不讓我介入其中
Kramer has decided to keep me out of the loop on this.

164
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,761
-他不讓你知道  -對
- He's keeping you out?  - Yeah.

165
00:06:05,161 --> 00:06:07,151
不過我有內線
But I've got an inside man.

166
00:06:08,861 --> 00:06:10,351
克雷默那邊怎麼樣
How'd it go with Kramer?

167
00:06:10,451 --> 00:06:12,891
他讓我查文件到凌晨三點
He had me digging through files till 3:00 A.M.

168
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:15,211
他想證明什麼
What's he trying to prove?

169
00:06:15,211 --> 00:06:16,091
不知道
I don't know.

170
00:06:16,091 --> 00:06:17,131
說起卡夫瑞
When he talks about Caffrey,

171
00:06:17,131 --> 00:06:18,881
他總是誇獎他的出色能力
he talks about him in glowing terms.

172
00:06:19,061 --> 00:06:20,111
我注意到了
I noticed that.

173
00:06:20,111 --> 00:06:22,111
他似乎很欣賞他
He seems to respect the hell out of him.

174
00:06:22,781 --> 00:06:24,581
可他在查尼爾在監獄裡寄給凱特
But he's digging into the coded letters

175
00:06:24,581 --> 00:06:26,421
那些密碼信件
Neal sent Kate from prison.

176
00:06:26,651 --> 00:06:28,061
克雷默破譯了密碼
And now that Kramer's cracked the code,

177
00:06:28,061 --> 00:06:29,601
他確信他會找出些什麼
he's convinced he'll find something.

178
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:32,431
是  不過是什麼呢
Yeah. But what?

179
00:06:44,651 --> 00:06:46,671
彼得
Petey!

180
00:06:47,081 --> 00:06:47,851
你好嗎
How are you?

181
00:06:47,851 --> 00:06:48,911
我很好
I'm good.

182
00:06:49,421 --> 00:06:51,831
在這裡辦公真有意思
It's an interesting place to set up shop.

183
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:54,301
你不覺得在辦公室裡更舒服嗎
You sure you wouldn't be more comfortable in an office?

184
00:06:54,641 --> 00:06:57,181
我不想佔用其他人的房間
Well, I don't want to intrude on someone else's house.

185
00:06:57,181 --> 00:06:58,751
在這裡我可以把東西都鋪開
And this lets me spread out.

186
00:06:59,191 --> 00:07:01,671
這間房就是我們找出真相的地方
And this is the room where we find the truth.

187
00:07:01,801 --> 00:07:03,501
應該會成功
That's how it's supposed to work.

188
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:07,421
我要伸伸腿
I need to stretch my legs.

189
00:07:08,571 --> 00:07:09,601
跟我走走
Walk with me.

190
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:13,821
你有什麼想法
You've got something on your mind?

191
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:17,081
你還在查尼爾的卷宗
You're still pulling Neal's casework.

192
00:07:17,491 --> 00:07:19,581
是不是有什麼事情該讓我知道
Is there something going on I should know about?

193
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:22,961
的確有  我很擔心你  彼得
Matter of fact, there is. I'm worried about you, Pete.

194
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:24,081
擔心
You're worried?

195
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:27,671
八音盒  加裡特·福勒  U型潛艇
Yeah. The music box, Garrett Fowler, e U-boat.

196
00:07:27,941 --> 00:07:31,071
這些卷宗讀著像低俗小說
These 515s read more like pulp fiction

197
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,181
而不像案件總結
than case summaries.

198
00:07:33,091 --> 00:07:34,101
你什麼意思
What are you saying?

199
00:07:34,181 --> 00:07:35,541
你知道我什麼意思
Well, you know what I'm saying.

200
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:38,191
你在掩護他
You're covering for him.

201
00:07:40,231 --> 00:07:41,291
不是嗎
Well, you're not?

202
00:07:42,901 --> 00:07:44,091
事情很複雜
It's complicated.

203
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:46,801
我很能體會
If anyone gets it, I do.

204
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,661
他是你的朋友
He's your friend.

205
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,991
是的  菲利
He is, Phil.

206
00:07:50,331 --> 00:07:52,401
我要保證他不會傷害你
And I want to make sure he's not gonna hurt you.

207
00:07:53,601 --> 00:07:55,571
你希望他回到監獄
You want him back behind bars?

208
00:07:55,661 --> 00:07:57,161
不是的  彼得
No, Pete.

209
00:07:57,921 --> 00:07:59,801
他的價值不止於此
He's much too valuable for that.

210
00:08:00,091 --> 00:08:00,951
什麼意思
Meaning?

211
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:04,171
我要尼爾為我工作  去華盛頓
I want Neal working for me. in D.C.

212
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:12,540

貓鼠遊戲 [妙警賊探]

214
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:23,629
第三季第16集（季終）

215
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,519
你第一次見到尼爾·卡夫瑞是什麼時候
When did you first meet Neal Caffrey?

216
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:33,639
他從監獄裡出來的那天
The day he was released from prison.

217
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:38,089
他們把他送到一個破敗不堪的小旅館裡
They had sent him to this horrible little fleabag motel.

218
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:41,199
你收留一個重罪犯  難道就不害怕嗎
And you had no qualms about taking in a convicted felon?

219
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:44,349
當然不會  尼爾沒問題
Absolutely not. Not Neal.

220
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:46,859
在我丈夫去世後
You see, after my husband passed,

221
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:51,469
我獨自一人住在空蕩蕩的大房子裡
I...I was living in this big, empty house.

222
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:56,889
尼爾改變了這一切
And...Neal changed all of that.

223
00:08:58,429 --> 00:09:00,259
我覺得他是上天給我的恩賜
I think of him as a blessing.

224
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:03,859
拜倫和我一直想要個兒子
Byron and I always wanted a son.

225
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,629
我真希望他還活著
I wish he was still alive...

226
00:09:09,569 --> 00:09:12,589
這樣他就能見到尼爾了
So that he could finally meet him.

227
00:09:14,439 --> 00:09:17,789
艾靈頓太太  在你看來
Ms. Ellington, in your opinion,

228
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:21,579
應該給尼爾·卡夫瑞減刑嗎
does Neal Caffrey deserve for his sentence to be commuted?

229
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:22,619
當然
Of course.

230
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,299
應該的
Yes.

231
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:28,649
你們一定要讓他重獲自由
And you must let him go free.

232
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:38,439
情況如何
How'd it go?

233
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,749
姐搞定了
I nailed it.

234
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:42,969
很好
Nice.

235
00:09:54,369 --> 00:09:55,439
你在想什麼呢
What are you thinking?

236
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:57,299
我在想我們需要第三個蛋糕了
I'm thinking we need a third cake.

237
00:09:57,369 --> 00:09:58,439
上邊寫什麼
One with a file in it?

238
00:09:58,439 --> 00:10:00,079
寫"一路順風"
One that says "Bon voyage."

239
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:01,779
克雷默不想放走尼爾
Kramer doesn't want to put Neal away.

240
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:04,389
他想讓尼爾去華盛頓為他工作
He wants to keep him for himself in D.C.

241
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:05,869
他想跟你搶尼爾
He'd take Neal away from you?

242
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:08,689
說是為我好  但這不是
For my own good, but that's not...

243
00:10:08,869 --> 00:10:09,799
怎麼回事
What is it?

244
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:13,609
有天晚上  從日落到日昇
One night, from sunset to sunrise,

245
00:10:13,609 --> 00:10:15,049
我給了尼爾完全豁免權
I gave Neal full immunity

246
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:16,859
要他對我坦白一切
to tell me everything he'd ever done.

247
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:18,099
他真坦白了
Wow. And he did?

248
00:10:18,099 --> 00:10:19,479
沒錯  全坦白了
Boy, he did.

249
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:21,139
但他有完全豁免權
But he has full immunity.

250
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:23,389
那是我許他的  不是局里許的
It was my immunity, not the bureau's.

251
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:25,779
如果克雷默發現了這些事
If Kramer digs up these things

252
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:27,149
尼爾可能會量重刑
Neal could get the maximum.

253
00:10:27,249 --> 00:10:29,069
別想華盛頓了  別想腳環了
Forget D.C. Forget the anklet.

254
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:30,569
他可能重回監獄
He could go back to prison.

255
00:10:30,569 --> 00:10:31,959
把牢底坐穿
For a long, long time.

256
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:34,399
你告訴他了嗎
Have you told him?

257
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,509
-沒  -親愛的
- No. - Hon...

258
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,529
我不能
I can't.

259
00:10:37,109 --> 00:10:39,559
如果尼爾感到威脅  他會惹更多的麻煩
When Neal's threatened, he gets in even more trouble.

260
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:44,549
和克雷默談談  他是你的朋友
Talk to Kramer. He's your friend.

261
00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:47,509
他不瞭解自己正在打開的潘多拉魔盒
He doesn't know the Pandora's box he's opening.

262
00:11:08,609 --> 00:11:10,029
我在看週一要處理的案件
I'm just skimming Monday's caseload,

263
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:11,289
想要預習一下
trying to get a head start.

264
00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:13,649
這起嘉寶沃斯卡的保險詐騙案看起來很有意思
This Grabowska insurance fraud looks pretty promising.

265
00:11:14,489 --> 00:11:15,809
我喜歡你積極的態度
I like that attitude.

266
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:34,549
我在想你什麼時候
I wondered how long it would be

267
00:11:34,549 --> 00:11:36,309
才會回來見我
before you came back to see me.

268
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:39,009
菲利普  我們得談談
Philip. We need to talk.

269
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:40,339
我想也是
I suppose we do.

270
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:42,649
你發現了尼爾的什麼事
What do you have on Neal?

271
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:44,309
要談的不是這個
That's not what this is about.

272
00:11:46,869 --> 00:11:48,369
尼爾需要被人管著
Neal needs boundaries.

273
00:11:48,369 --> 00:11:49,379
我知道
I know that.

274
00:11:49,849 --> 00:11:50,689
是嗎
You do?

275
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:55,939
我跟你說過我的線人  我的"尼爾"
I told you about my C.I. My "Neal."

276
00:11:56,379 --> 00:11:57,619
是  你們很親密
Yeah. You were close.

277
00:11:57,619 --> 00:11:59,929
比親密還親密  他就像我兒子一樣
We were more than close. He was like a son.

278
00:12:00,249 --> 00:12:02,659
真是的  我還自以為可以讓他改邪歸正
Hell, I thought I'd brought him all the way around,

279
00:12:03,229 --> 00:12:04,919
但他本性難改
but he couldn't change who he was.

280
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:07,789
就因為你給你的線人戴上了手銬
Well, you know, just because you slapped cuffs on your C.I.

281
00:12:07,789 --> 00:12:10,839
並不意味著我和尼爾也會步後塵
Doesn't mean that I'll have to do the same to Neal.

282
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:15,529
你知道青蛙和蠍子的故事嗎
You know the story of the frog and the scorpion?

283
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,299
尼爾就是蠍子
Neal's the scorpion.

284
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,619
他本性愛蜇人  他會咬你
He can't help who he is. But he will sting you.

285
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:23,849
凱特·莫羅
郵政信箱  3279
紐約主街

286
00:12:23,859 --> 00:12:25,129
你倆都會溺水
And you'll both drown.

287
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:27,849
在華盛頓  我可以盯住他
In D.C., I can keep an eye on him.

288
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:32,329
那過了兩年他重獲自由後呢
What happens in two years, when he's a free man?

289
00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:34,699
誰說他會自由
Who's to say he will be?

290
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:36,189
這就是你的目的
That's what you're after.

291
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:38,849
你想用你掌握的全部線索
You want to use whatever you find

292
00:12:38,849 --> 00:12:40,599
來無限延長他的刑期
to extend his sentence indefinitely.

293
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:42,149
這樣對大家都好
It's best for all concerned.

294
00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:42,809
菲利
Phil --

295
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:44,839
他能施展自己的才華
He gets to do what he's so damn good at,

296
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:48,089
而不會淪落監獄  或者下場更慘
and he won't end up being locked away or worse.

297
00:12:48,379 --> 00:12:49,969
我覺得他不該重獲自由
I don't think he should go free.

298
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:52,359
你說真的嗎
You mean that?

299
00:12:52,369 --> 00:12:53,349
是的
I do.

300
00:12:53,349 --> 00:12:56,549
紐約傳票
關於  尼爾·卡夫瑞
送交  斯博保險公司

301
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:55,709
我之前還沒有決定  但現在決定了
Until this moment, I didn't, but no.

302
00:12:55,749 --> 00:12:56,679
莎拉
Sara.

303
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:58,339
尼爾不能重獲自由
Neal should not go free.

304
00:12:58,619 --> 00:13:01,839
兩年後  他的刑期結束
In two years time, when his sentence is over,

305
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:05,039
他就有權決定自己的生活
He's earned that right to decide his own life.

306
00:13:05,469 --> 00:13:06,319
彼得
Peter...

307
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:11,809
在那之前  尼爾在這裡  和我在一起
And until then, Neal's staying here, with me.

308
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:18,069
克雷默想要傳票我的文件嗎
Kramer is going to subpoena my files?

309
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:20,599
看來我曾非常接近拉斐爾的畫作
That means I was close to the Raphael.

310
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:22,069
是的
Yes.

311
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:23,559
我就知道  是你偷的
I knew it! You stole it!

312
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:24,759
被你發現了
You caught me.

313
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:25,729
尼爾
Neal!

314
00:13:26,499 --> 00:13:27,579
這太棒了
This is so great!

315
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:29,489
我花了好多年時間找那幅畫
I've spent years looking for that painting.

316
00:13:29,489 --> 00:13:30,489
我有多接近
How close was I?

317
00:13:30,489 --> 00:13:34,279
克雷默破譯了一封我在監獄裡寫的加密信
Kramer cracked a coded letter that I wrote in prison

318
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,909
其中有藏匿地點的一部分
that includes a partial address of where I hid it.

319
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:37,679
你認為我有另外一部分嗎
So you think I have the other part?

320
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:38,579
我知道你有
I know you do.

321
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:40,679
天啊  我差點就查出來了
My God. I was so close.

322
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:41,749
沒錯  確實
Yes, you were.

323
00:13:42,819 --> 00:13:45,019
我們多年前就賠了保險金
Well, we already paid out that claim years ago.

324
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:48,069
你欠斯博公司1千5百萬
You owe Sterling Bosch $15 million.

325
00:13:48,749 --> 00:13:50,889
如果我不蹲監獄  我會想法子弄錢的
If I stay out of prison, I will work it off.

326
00:13:51,849 --> 00:13:54,289
監獄寫信裡的加密地址
So, a coded address in a prison letter --

327
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:55,969
看起來很冒險啊
That seems kind of chancy.

328
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:57,409
我沒寫郵編
I left off the zip code.

329
00:13:57,459 --> 00:13:59,079
那地方又是在主街上
And the address is on main street.

330
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:00,539
你知道美國有多少條主街嗎
You know how many main streets there are?

331
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:01,369
可能有上千條
Probably thousands.

332
00:14:01,369 --> 00:14:03,769
那時有19364條
19,364 -- at the time.

333
00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:05,689
那克雷默找到的地址毫無用處
So the address Kramer found means nothing.

334
00:14:05,689 --> 00:14:07,819
除非他拿到有郵編的那片
Unless he gets his hands on that zip code.

335
00:14:07,819 --> 00:14:10,169
你要找的是這個嗎
Is this what you're looking for?

336
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,509
沒錯  正是
Yes, it is.

337
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:13,909
羅斯福島
Roosevelt Island?

338
00:14:13,909 --> 00:14:16,569
我是在酒鬼郵遞員的垃圾堆裡翻到的
I found this digging through a boozy courier's trash.

339
00:14:16,569 --> 00:14:18,159
我就知道不該放棄這條線索
I knew I shouldn't have given up this lead.

340
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,179
這是唯一的一份嗎
Is this the only copy?

341
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:22,029
不是  服務器上的所有文件都有電子拷貝
No. We keep electronic copies of everything on the server.

342
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,619
所以我丟掉這份也是無濟於事
So I can't just throw this one away.

343
00:14:23,619 --> 00:14:24,769
確實
No.

344
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,089
拉斐爾裝貨收據

345
00:14:28,169 --> 00:14:29,089
拒絕訪問

346
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,169
我已經沒有權限了
And I've been locked out.

347
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:33,169
-打擾一下  -有什麼可以幫您  先生
- Excuse me. - Can I help you out, sir?

348
00:14:33,169 --> 00:14:34,669
我們來送傳票的
We're here to serve a subpoena.

349
00:14:34,669 --> 00:14:35,929
我們要全部有關
We need all the files related

350
00:14:35,939 --> 00:14:37,729
拉斐爾《聖喬治亞和蛟龍》的資料
to Raphael's Saint George And The Dragon.

351
00:14:37,729 --> 00:14:38,229
聯調局
FBI.

352
00:14:41,239 --> 00:14:42,209
斯博公司
Sterling Bosch.

353
00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:43,369
我是莎拉·埃利斯
This is Sara Ellis speaking.

354
00:14:43,369 --> 00:14:46,319
-埃利斯女士  -我是聯調局探員克雷默
- Ms. Ellis. - Special agent Kramer, FBI.

355
00:14:46,749 --> 00:14:50,009
克雷默探員  有什麼能為你效勞的先生
Agent kramer! What can I do to help you, sir?

356
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:53,199
我手下的探員給你辦公室送了張傳票索要
My agents are serving a subpoena at your office for all

357
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,139
一切有關拉斐爾《聖喬治亞和蛟龍》的資料
the files to related Raphael's Saint George And The Dragon.

358
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:58,979
我到底該怎麼辦
What the hell am I supposed to do?

359
00:14:58,979 --> 00:15:00,449
爭取點時間
Just buy me some time.

360
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,969
先生  您肯定聽說了吧
Well, sir, you must have heard.

361
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:05,009
聽說了什麼
Heard what?

362
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:07,169
我們今早找回了那幅畫
We recovered the painting this morning.

363
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,139
你今早找回了拉斐爾的畫嗎
You recovered the Raphael this morning?

364
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:10,889
上頭要求我暫時保密
I was told to keep it under wraps

365
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:12,829
畢竟還有些細節要處理一下
as we're still working out the details.

366
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:14,459
那畫現在在哪裡
Well, where's the painting now?

367
00:15:14,969 --> 00:15:17,119
-在鑒定師手上  -很好
- With our authenticator. - Good.

368
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:19,299
我會親自前往拿這幅畫
I'll be there myself to take possession of the painting

369
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:20,959
今天下班後就去
by end of business today.

370
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,939
希望你沒騙我
And I hope you're telling me the truth.

371
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:25,829
因為如果我六點鐘拿不到畫
Because if it's not there by 6:00,

372
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:29,109
就會以妨礙司法公正起訴你
I'll be charging you with obstruction of justice.

373
00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:30,009
好的  先生
Yes, sir.

374
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:34,009
我為你爭取到了六個小時
I bought you six hours.

375
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:36,659
如果那幅畫到時候還沒交到我手上
If that painting isn't in my hands by the end of the day--

376
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:37,749
肯定會的
It will be.

377
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,050
你和卡夫瑞先生的私人關係
Has your personal relationship with Mr. Caffrey

378
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,950
會影響你今天的證詞嗎
influenced your testimony today?

379
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,250
是的  肯定有影響
Yes. Most definitely.

380
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,560
這不是你第一次
This isn't the first time

381
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,910
-為卡夫瑞先生的事作證了吧  -確實
- you've testified regarding Mr. Caffrey, is it? - No.

382
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,300
六年前  我曾指證他
Six years ago, I testified against him.

383
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,910
沒錯  在他被判偽造罪的審訊上
Yes. At the trail where he was convicted of forgery?

384
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:03,880
是的
Yes.

385
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,690
我竭盡全力地追查他
And I went after him with everything I had.

386
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:08,650
我罵他是騙子  小偷
I called him a liar and a thief

387
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,940
甚至是反社會分子  我可是真心的
and probably a sociopath, and I meant every word of it.

388
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,160
那什麼改變了
So, what changed?

389
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,880
尼爾改變了
Neal did.

390
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,970
尼爾  你在哪
Neal? Where are you?

391
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,110
你知道的
You know where I am.

392
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,990
你在羅斯福島纜車上
You're at the Roosevelt Island Tram.

393
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,660
你在可活動範圍的最邊緣
You're at the edge of your radius.

394
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,390
克雷默在查拉斐爾畫的事
Kramer is going after the Raphael.

395
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,380
你記得不久前的一個夜晚
You'll recall a night not long ago

396
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,770
你說我有豁免權嗎
when you said I had immunity?

397
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:31,760
我記得  尼爾
I remember, Neal.

398
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,620
你也該記得我說別做傻事
You'll recall that I said don't do anything stupid.

399
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,080
七年前  我做了一件傻事
Seven years ago, I did something stupid.

400
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,320
克雷默在追捕以前的尼爾·卡夫瑞
Kramer's going after the old Neal Caffrey.

401
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,200
我今天需要走出兩英里半徑區域
I need more than two miles today.

402
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,650
該死  尼爾  你這樣正中克雷默下懷
Damn it, Neal, you're playing right into Kramer's hands.

403
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,550
你要是被抓了
You get caught,

404
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,350
他就會抓到你持有贓物
he's got you on possession of stolen goods.

405
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,630
加上你的前科  會被判二十五年的
With your prior, that's 25 years.

406
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,440
我無法撤銷以前做過的事
I can't undo what's already been done.

407
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,110
但我可以歸回不屬於我的東西
But I can get back what's not mine.

408
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,600
我得走了
I got to go.

409
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,020
彼得  拜託  擴大我的活動範圍吧
Peter, please, extend my radius.

410
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,230
你要去哪
Where are you going?

411
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,570
去打開一扇我不想打開的門
To open a door I didn't want to have to open.

412
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,240
尼爾  尼爾
Neal? Neal!

413

電子監控小組

我是聯調局的博爾克
This is Burke, FBI.

416
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,250
拜託
Come on.

417
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,910
謝了  兄弟
Thank you, buddy.

418
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,550
這號碼挺陌生的
I don't recognize this number.

419
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,050
安靜聽著  蚊子  克雷默在調查拉斐爾畫作
Silent running, Moz. Kramer's after the Raphael.

420
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,170
尼爾  你在哪

421
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,490
在去羅斯福島的纜車上
On a tram headed for Roosevelt Island.

422
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,800
真的嗎  羅斯福島  為什麼
Really? Roosevelt Island? Why?

423
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,720
晚些再解釋
I'll explain later.

424
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,000
現在我要你給我弄個交通工具
Right now I need you to find us transportation.

425
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,720
我可能需要你幫我返回
I may need your help getting back.

426
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,330
再見
Bye.

427
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,700
我是尼爾
It's Neal.

428
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,410
尼爾
Neal.

429
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:43,930
海倫
Helen.

430
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:47,370
好久沒見了  自從
I haven't seen you since --

431
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,510
自從我逃走那天起
Since the day I ran away.

432
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,740
真好
This is nice.

433
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,930
你還住在河畔
Still living by the river, I see.

434
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,430
這裡成了我家
It's become my home.

435
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:06,960
今年是冷春
It's been a cold spring,

436
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,900
但繡球花還是重新綻放了
but the hydrangea are coming back.

437
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:12,950
在這裡嗎
Is it here?

438
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:14,470
在
It is.

439
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,370
你能待多久
How much time do you have?

440
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,510
大概十分鐘
Maybe 10 minutes.

441
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,620
那我們就好好利用吧
Then let's make the most of it.

442
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:27,330
瓊斯  能精確定位卡夫瑞在島上的位置嗎
Jones, can you pinpoint where Caffrey is on Roosevelt Island

443
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,360
可以  他貌似在4221主街
Yeah. Looks like he's at 4221 main street.

444
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,320
我這就去
On my way.

445
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,190
你氣色不錯
You look good.

446
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,080
沒什麼變化
The same.

447
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,200
得了
Please.

448
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,940
都差不多十五年了
It's been nearly a decade and a half.

449
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,170
是啊  那是我十八歲的生日
Yeah, it was my 18th birthday.

450
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,740
對  我算是毀了你的生日
Yeah, I kind of ruined that one for you.

451
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,350
讓一個孩子聽到那種消息確實可怕
It was a hell of a thing for a kid to hear.

452
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,540
我為你保留的
I saved this for you.

453
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,730
-你和你父親  -天哪
- You and your father. - My God.

454
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,820
你的眼睛還是很像他
You still have his eyes.

455
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,750
說真的
Truth.

456
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,900
我告訴你自己做過的事之後  你恨我嗎
Do you hate me for telling you what I did?

457
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,300
不恨
No.

458
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,590
不  我媽說他死了
No, my mom told me he was dead.

459
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,900
說他是壯烈犧牲的  但你告訴了我真相
Said he died a hero, but you told me the truth.

460
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,840
他是個壞警察
He was a dirty cop...

461
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,400
而且他還沒死
And he's not dead.

462
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,020
你當時都準備投身警界了
You were gonna go and join the force.

463
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:35,390
我告訴你媽
I told your mother,

464
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,910
"只要他一進警校
"The moment he sets foot in the police academy,

465
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,120
肯定會聽到風言風語"
he's gonna get an earful."

466
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,290
說真的
Truth.

467
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,600
我爸一直都腐敗嗎
Was my father always corrupt?

468
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,210
我們剛做警探那年相遇並成為了搭檔
We met when we became partners as first-year detectives.

469
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,210
他當時  是最棒的
He was the best... then.

470
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,840
而邪惡轉瞬即至
the evil came after.

471
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,370
但你來不是為了這個吧
But that's not why you're here.

472
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:04,980
不是
No.

473
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,230
4221主街
4221 main street.

474
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,060
是棟高樓
It's a high-rise.

475
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,520
對  我排查了所有房客
Yeah, I ran all the tenants.

476
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,250
14-E的住戶已經被標上了
The person in 14-E's been flagged.

477
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,370
被誰標上了
Flagged by whom?

478
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:17,470
聯邦法警
The marshals.

479
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,180
E·帕克爾正在接受證人保護
E. Parker's in witness protection.

480
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,190
謝了  瓊斯
Thanks, Jones.

481
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:28,720
給你  保管得很好  沒打開過
Here it is. Kept it safe. Didn't open it.

482
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,810
郵戳就是你被捕的前一天
It's postmarked the day before you were arrested.

483
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,000
對
Yeah.

484
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,510
凱特從沒來拿過嗎
Kate never came to get it?

485
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,530
-那個黑髮的美女  -對
- The pretty girl with the dark hair. - Yeah.

486
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,760
她來過  大概五年前吧
She did. Almost five years ago now.

487
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:41,770
但她沒拿走
But she didn't take it?

488
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,030
她改變主意了
She changed her mind.

489
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,160
說想要你留著
Said she wanted you to have it.

490
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,520
我媽媽呢  你是否曾
What about my mom? Did you ever --

491
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,220
沒有
No.

492
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:53,060
沒她的消息  你爸的也沒有
I haven't seen or heard from her -- or your father --

493
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,850
好多年了
It's been years.

494
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,090
我得承認我很好奇
I have to admit I'm curious.

495
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:00,070
這裡面到底有什麼特殊的東西
What is in there that's so special?

496
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,180
我想用它來換回我曾經的日子
Something I took trying to get back a life I lost,

497
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,760
它卻一直在向我討債
and it's been chasing me ever since.

498
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,420
最好別讓它抓到你
Better not let it catch you.

499
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,380
我很抱歉來這兒
Listen -- coming here, I'm sorry.

500
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,190
聯調局也會來這  他們會盤查
The FBI is gonna show up. They'll ask questions.

501
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,300
反正這島對我來說也有點小
This island was getting a little small for me anyway.

502
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:21,400
你走吧
Now, go.

503
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:23,820
謝謝
Thank you.

504
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:28,510
為所有的一切
For everything.

505
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,890
我想知道裡面是什麼嗎
Do I want to know what's in there?

506
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,150
合理推諉
Plausible deniability.

507
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:45,950
走吧  我們去坐纜車
Come on, let's catch that tram.

508
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,150
我的車在對岸
My car's on the other side.

509
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,420
E·帕克爾是誰
Who is E. Parker?

510
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,030
我從沒告訴過任何人
I've never told anyone this --

511
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,820
蚊子都沒
not even Moz.

512
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,010
你要接電話嗎
You gonna get that?

513
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,730
彼得  我是戴安
Peter, it's Diana.

514
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:28,990
我和克雷默在一起
I'm with Kramer.

515
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,680
他知道卡夫瑞在羅斯福島
He knows Caffrey's on Roosevelt Island.

516
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,040
你在哪
Where are you?

517
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,470
我們在曼哈頓這邊的纜車出站口
We're at the tram terminal, Manhattan side.

518
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:35,880
該死
Damn it.

519
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,020
怎麼了
What's going on?

520
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:37,960
你和卡夫瑞在一起
You're with Caffrey.

521
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:41,010
對  我們正往你們那邊走
Yeah. And we're headed right to you.

522
00:23:51,688 --> 00:23:52,688
首先說一下
Let me first say

523
00:23:52,688 --> 00:23:54,988
博爾克探員和我結婚已有12年
that Agent Burke and I have been married for 12 years.

524
00:23:55,728 --> 00:23:59,268
我們的關係基於尊重  欣賞和信任
It's a partnership that's built on respect, admiration, and trust.

525
00:23:59,268 --> 00:24:00,788
這有什麼關聯性嗎
And how is this relevant?

526
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:03,618
彼得和尼爾的關係也是基於同樣的因素
Peter's relationship with Neal is based on the same elements

527
00:24:03,828 --> 00:24:05,318
你丈夫信任尼爾
Your husband trusts Neal?

528
00:24:05,728 --> 00:24:07,668
是的  關鍵時候
He does. When it counts.

529
00:24:08,148 --> 00:24:09,058
關鍵時候
When it counts?

530
00:24:09,628 --> 00:24:11,378
尼爾曾是騙子
Well, Neal was a con man.

531
00:24:11,438 --> 00:24:13,208
我不知道你是否願意讓他和你妹妹約會
I don't know if you'd want him dating your sister.

532
00:24:15,128 --> 00:24:15,998
我能收回那句話嗎
Can I take that back?

533
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:17,678
不能
No.

534
00:24:19,378 --> 00:24:21,288
是這樣的  彼得和尼爾一起
Listen -- Peter and Neal together,

535
00:24:21,288 --> 00:24:22,458
他們會吵架拌嘴
they argue and bicker.

536
00:24:23,018 --> 00:24:25,328
但最終  關鍵時刻
But in the end -- when it counts --

537
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:29,128
彼得容忍尼爾  因為尼爾值得
Peter puts up with Neal because he's worth it.

538
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:32,788
卡夫瑞先生應該獲得減刑嗎
Should Mr. Caffrey's sentence be commuted?

539
00:24:33,368 --> 00:24:34,018
是的
Yes.

540
00:24:36,878 --> 00:24:37,838
這可不妙
This is not good.

541
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,438
不妙  我們一出去
No, we ride this out,

542
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:42,208
你又得再坐二十年牢
and you're put away for 20 years.

543
00:24:42,768 --> 00:24:43,768
也許還有別的出路
Well, maybe there's another way.

544
00:24:44,578 --> 00:24:45,198
什麼
What?

545
00:24:45,948 --> 00:24:46,788
不行  想都別想
No. Forget that.

546
00:24:46,978 --> 00:24:48,158
要是掉下去你就死定了
You'll never survive the fall.

547
00:24:48,308 --> 00:24:49,208
我不會跳
I'm not gonna to jump.

548
00:24:49,438 --> 00:24:50,758
那你準備怎麼做
Then what the hell are you planning?

549
00:24:51,388 --> 00:24:52,398
幫忙我就告訴你
Help me out and I'll tell you.

550
00:24:52,588 --> 00:24:54,278
不行  先告訴我  我再幫你
No, tell me, then I'll help you out.

551
00:24:54,568 --> 00:24:55,218
你先幫
You first.

552
00:24:56,808 --> 00:24:57,478
好吧
Fine.

553
00:25:03,968 --> 00:25:04,588
謝謝
Thank you.

554
00:25:05,518 --> 00:25:06,118
然後呢
And?

555
00:25:06,328 --> 00:25:08,088
我要跳到另一輛纜車返回羅斯福島
And I'm doubling back toward Roosevelt Island.

556
00:25:08,388 --> 00:25:09,258
祝我好運吧
Wish me luck.

557
00:25:09,588 --> 00:25:11,048
什麼  不  尼爾  太瘋狂了
What? No. Neal, that's crazy.

558
00:25:14,128 --> 00:25:15,458
該死  快給我回來
Damn it, get back in here!

559
00:25:17,318 --> 00:25:17,948
尼爾
Neal!

560
00:25:20,988 --> 00:25:22,138
你跳不過去的
You'll never make it!

561
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:24,008
尼爾
Neal!

562
00:25:28,178 --> 00:25:28,728
尼爾
Neal!

563
00:25:50,868 --> 00:25:51,708
什麼事  蚊子
What's up, Moz?

564
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,178
尼爾  你有空嗎
Neal, you got a second?

565
00:25:53,648 --> 00:25:54,438
現在有
I do now.

566
00:25:54,638 --> 00:25:56,018
你那兒聽著風挺大的
It sounds windy where you are.

567
00:25:56,278 --> 00:25:57,438
確實  什麼事
Yeah. What is it?

568
00:25:57,998 --> 00:25:59,158
莎拉和我有個計劃
Sara and I have a plan.

569
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:00,608
你還在羅斯福島嗎
Are you still on Roosevelt Island?

570
00:26:01,028 --> 00:26:01,908
就快到了
I will be soon.

571
00:26:02,068 --> 00:26:03,908
我已經設計好了一條逃跑路線
I've carved out an escape route.

572
00:26:04,088 --> 00:26:05,408
在第五街和東街交匯處
Meet me at the traffic circle

573
00:26:05,408 --> 00:26:07,358
交通轉盤那裡等我
where road 5 and east road connect.

574
00:26:07,468 --> 00:26:08,278
馬上去
I'm on my way.

575
00:26:25,158 --> 00:26:26,668
你能告訴我發生了什麼事嗎
You gonna tell me what happened up there?

576
00:26:27,068 --> 00:26:28,458
我追蹤尼爾到了羅斯福島
I tracked Neal to the island.

577
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:29,698
我正要帶他回來
I was bringing him back --

578
00:26:29,778 --> 00:26:31,868
-那他在哪  -他本該跟我在一起
- Then where is he?  - He'd be here with me now

579
00:26:31,868 --> 00:26:33,728
偏偏你這邊一堆槍指著他
if you hadn't thrown a dozen guns at his face.

580
00:26:34,188 --> 00:26:35,118
這還成我的錯了
This is my fault?

581
00:26:35,868 --> 00:26:37,368
你逼得越緊  他就越會跑
You box him in, he's gonna run.

582
00:26:38,248 --> 00:26:41,148
你根本駕馭不了他  只有我能
You have no idea how to handle him. I do.

583
00:26:42,148 --> 00:26:42,918
顯然
Clearly.

584
00:26:44,048 --> 00:26:44,818
告訴我  彼得
Tell me, Pete.

585
00:26:45,408 --> 00:26:46,598
尼爾手上有畫嗎
Neal have the painting on him?

586
00:26:48,298 --> 00:26:49,078
我沒看見
Not that I saw.

587
00:26:50,158 --> 00:26:52,718
你是在駕馭他  還是在變成他
Are you handling him or becoming him?

588
00:26:53,998 --> 00:26:56,558
長官  東行的纜車快到島上了
Sir. The eastbound tram is approaching the island.

589
00:26:57,138 --> 00:26:59,578
繼續追捕卡夫瑞  我去市中心
Maintain pursuit on Caffrey. I'm heading downtown.

590
00:27:02,508 --> 00:27:04,748
尼爾還有不到一小時時間去見莎拉·埃利斯
Neal's got under an hour to meet Sara Ellis.

591
00:27:04,838 --> 00:27:07,218
如果他成功了  我會在那兒等他
If he makes it, I'll be waiting for him.

592
00:27:15,748 --> 00:27:17,348
-快進去  -媽媽  你看
- Coming in now. - Mom, look at that.

593
00:27:24,258 --> 00:27:24,848
尼爾
Neal?

594
00:27:28,468 --> 00:27:29,468
蚊子  快開車
Moz, start the engine!

595
00:27:56,097 --> 00:27:57,497
卡夫瑞善解人意
Caffery understands people.

596
00:27:58,933 --> 00:28:00,753
你需要空間  他就一人待著
You need space, he keeps to himself.

597
00:28:00,813 --> 00:28:02,043
你想要說話  他就靜靜聆聽
You need to talk, he listens.

598
00:28:03,133 --> 00:28:04,343
你想喝啤酒  他就幫你倒
You need a beer, he'll pour.

599
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:07,283
但他會讓你感覺到他在屈尊紆貴
Although he'll let you know he's slumming it.

600
00:28:08,443 --> 00:28:10,013
你支持他獲得減刑嗎
Do you support his commutation?

601
00:28:11,683 --> 00:28:12,873
他工作非常出色
He's damn good at what he does,

602
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:15,443
我當他是我的朋友
and I consider him a friend.

603
00:28:17,773 --> 00:28:19,093
但這不能改變
But that doesn't change the fact

604
00:28:19,103 --> 00:28:21,963
他因偽造債券和越獄被定罪的事實
that he's a convicted bond forger and prison escapee.

605
00:28:23,983 --> 00:28:26,523
我覺得他應該在局裡再干滿兩年
I think he should finish out his two years with the bureau

606
00:28:26,643 --> 00:28:27,403
並心存感激
and be grateful...

607
00:28:28,713 --> 00:28:30,693
因為這已經是我所見過的最好的交易了
that he's got the best damn deal I've ever seen.

608
00:28:36,723 --> 00:28:38,763
好了  莎拉在斯博保險公司等你
Okay, Sara's waiting for you at Sterling Bosch.

609
00:28:38,793 --> 00:28:40,943
如果你及時收工  你就圓滿了
If you can make the hand-off in time, you're golden.

610
00:28:41,473 --> 00:28:42,063
"如果"
"If."

611
00:28:42,473 --> 00:28:44,103
你成功的可能性有
Well, the odds of you making it are --

612
00:28:44,103 --> 00:28:44,983
我知道  蚊子
I know, Moz.

613
00:28:45,593 --> 00:28:46,393
但我別無選擇
But I don't have a choice.

614
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:48,023
不  你有
Yes. You do.

615
00:28:54,353 --> 00:28:55,523
你把洛萊娜拿出來幹嘛
What's Lolana doing here?

616
00:28:56,093 --> 00:28:57,943
在我們短暫的疏離時期
Well, during our brief alienation --

617
00:28:58,493 --> 00:29:00,663
凱勒慘敗之前
before the whole Keller fiasco...

618
00:29:03,453 --> 00:29:06,433
我把你應得的那份寶藏轉移出國了
I moved your portion of the treasure out of the country,

619
00:29:06,433 --> 00:29:07,793
所以你不用想著索賠了
should you ever care to claim it.

620
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:09,613
你給我留了一半
You saved my half?

621
00:29:09,793 --> 00:29:11,083
比一半稍微少點
Well, a little less than half.

622
00:29:12,193 --> 00:29:13,493
我當時很生氣  有種告我去
I was angry -- sue me.

623
00:29:14,183 --> 00:29:15,793
還是夠我們倆個
It's still worth more than either of us

624
00:29:15,793 --> 00:29:17,183
一輩子花的
could ever spend in a lifetime.

625
00:29:17,463 --> 00:29:19,123
我們可以跑  現在就跑
We could run. Right now.

626
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:20,783
永不回頭
Never look back.

627
00:29:23,273 --> 00:29:24,543
我不想再逃了  蚊子
I don't want to run anymore, Moz.

628
00:29:25,543 --> 00:29:26,943
所有分隊  請留意
All units, be on the lookout

629
00:29:26,943 --> 00:29:28,663
一輛被偷的313號救護車
for stolen ambulance number 313.

630
00:29:29,733 --> 00:29:31,493
那是我們  別說什麼不逃了
That's us. So much for not running.

631
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:32,903
我得做個了斷
I have to finish this.

632
00:29:34,163 --> 00:29:35,993
我就知道你會這麼說
I somehow knew you were gonna say that.

633
00:29:36,513 --> 00:29:39,213
但為了洛萊娜  我還是得試試
But for Lolana's sake, I had to give it a try.

634
00:29:39,923 --> 00:29:40,523
走吧
Go.

635
00:29:40,943 --> 00:29:42,613
我去引著聯邦政府的小嘍囉們
I'll lead the federal bloodhounds

636
00:29:42,623 --> 00:29:44,683
游車河去
on a chase of the wild-goose variety.

637
00:29:45,073 --> 00:29:45,923
謝了  蚊子
Thanks, Moz.

638
00:29:47,433 --> 00:29:48,053
給
Here.

639
00:29:48,983 --> 00:29:50,753
我是我沒成功  你和洛萊娜需要憑這個
If I don't make it, you and Lolana will need that

640
00:29:50,753 --> 00:29:52,013
自己去買座島了
to get to the island without me.

641
00:29:54,593 --> 00:29:55,333
你會成功的
You'll make it.

642
00:30:07,383 --> 00:30:08,093
莎拉
hey, Sara.

643
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,253
你在哪兒
Where are you?

644
00:30:09,393 --> 00:30:10,433
幾條街外
A few blocks away.

645
00:30:10,543 --> 00:30:12,453
在大廳見我  很快了
Listen -- meet me in the lobby. It's gonna be close.

646
00:30:13,233 --> 00:30:13,903
尼爾  我
Neal, I --

647
00:30:19,243 --> 00:30:19,813
尼爾
Neal.

648
00:30:20,163 --> 00:30:21,313
莎拉  有尼爾的消息嗎
Sara, have you heard from Neal?

649
00:30:21,603 --> 00:30:22,553
他拿到畫了
He's got the painting,

650
00:30:22,553 --> 00:30:24,043
但他沒擺脫掉克雷默
But he's not gonna get past Kramer.

651
00:30:24,263 --> 00:30:25,453
可能他根本不需要
He may not have to.

652
00:30:25,753 --> 00:30:28,163
五分鐘內安排一場跟你們老闆的會談
Get us a meeting with your boss in the next five minutes.

653
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:30,083
-我盡力  -不是盡力  是一定要
- I'll try. - Don't try. Do it.

654
00:30:36,253 --> 00:30:37,273
我看到卡夫瑞了
I have eyes on Caffrey.

655
00:30:37,563 --> 00:30:38,343
不妙
Not good.

656
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:40,133
珍珠酒店往東
Heading east on Pearl.

657
00:30:43,533 --> 00:30:44,803
我肯定會反悔的
I'm gonna regret this.

658
00:30:48,183 --> 00:30:51,743
什麼  給我把這東西挪開
What?! Hey! Hey! You got to move that thing!

659
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:52,983
做不到的  女士
No can do, ma'am.

660
00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:02,483
你在幹什麼
What are you doing?!

661
00:31:20,203 --> 00:31:20,783
尼爾
Neal!

662
00:31:21,933 --> 00:31:22,633
上車
Get in!

663
00:31:30,253 --> 00:31:31,923
克雷默探員  卡夫瑞跟丟了
Agent Kramer, we lost Caffrey.

664
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,423
所有人去斯博公司
All units fall back to Sterling Bosch.

665
00:31:34,713 --> 00:31:36,243
包圍整棟建築
Form a perimeter around the building.

666
00:31:39,953 --> 00:31:41,393
-謝了  -祝你好運  卡夫瑞
- Thank you. - Good luck, Caffrey.

667
00:31:47,023 --> 00:31:48,383
你們的提議
Your proposal...

668
00:31:49,643 --> 00:31:51,323
似乎極其反常
It all seems highly irregular.

669
00:31:51,323 --> 00:31:52,393
是的  博世先生
Yes, Mr. Bosch,

670
00:31:52,393 --> 00:31:54,093
但您得承認  這種反常
But you can admit that irregularity

671
00:31:54,093 --> 00:31:56,103
我過去可是屢試不爽
has worked very well for me in the past.

672
00:31:56,103 --> 00:31:57,643
我是給您提供了一個
And I'm offering you an opportunity

673
00:31:57,643 --> 00:32:00,403
五分鐘內賺到1千5百萬的機會
to make $15 million in five minutes.

674
00:32:01,323 --> 00:32:03,633
博爾克探員  你能向我保證這是合法的嗎
Agent Burke, you can assure me this is all legal?

675
00:32:04,323 --> 00:32:05,553
不合法的話  我根本不會在此
I wouldn't be here if it weren't.

676
00:32:07,643 --> 00:32:08,763
我要做什麼
What do I have to do?

677
00:32:09,073 --> 00:32:11,073
只需要簽幾項啟動文件  先生
Just sign some start paperwork, sir.

678
00:32:24,933 --> 00:32:26,853
應該說這一刻是注定的
I'd say this moment was inevitable,

679
00:32:26,973 --> 00:32:27,883
不是嗎  尼爾
wouldn't you, Neal?

680
00:32:29,463 --> 00:32:30,873
我就知道你很適合
I knew you could be reasonable.

681
00:32:32,143 --> 00:32:35,533
你肯定會在華盛頓大放異彩的
I think you might take a real shine to D.C. after all.

682
00:32:37,103 --> 00:32:38,013
別指望了
Don't count on it.

683
00:32:40,323 --> 00:32:41,683
你來盡主人之誼吧  彼得
You do the honors, Pete.

684
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:50,183
我真該聽你的話  現在落他手裡了
I should have listened to you. I played right into his hands

685
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:51,783
還沒結束呢
It's not over yet.

686
00:32:53,063 --> 00:32:55,473
拉斐爾的《聖喬治亞和蛟龍》
Raphael's Saint George And The Dragon.

687
00:32:55,813 --> 00:32:56,813
開創性傑作
A seminal work.

688
00:32:56,913 --> 00:32:57,623
勞駕
Excuse me.

689
00:32:58,313 --> 00:33:00,763
這幅畫是斯博保險的財產
That painting is property of Sterling Bosch Insurance.

690
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:03,493
勇氣可嘉  埃利斯女士
Valiant Effort, Ms. Ellis.

691
00:33:03,973 --> 00:33:07,263
這是刑事犯罪的證據
This is evidence in a criminal investigation.

692
00:33:07,423 --> 00:33:08,663
什麼刑事犯罪
Investigation into what?

693
00:33:09,313 --> 00:33:11,453
B類贓物持有罪
Class "B" possession of stolen property.

694
00:33:11,633 --> 00:33:12,383
閣下哪位
And you are?

695
00:33:12,653 --> 00:33:14,913
溫斯頓·博世  這位年輕女士的老闆
Winston Bosch. This young lady works for me.

696
00:33:15,143 --> 00:33:17,893
我沒看到有什麼人持有贓物
I don't see anyone here with stolen property.

697
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:19,643
這幅畫
This painting --

698
00:33:19,733 --> 00:33:20,973
屬於斯博公司
Belongs to Sterling Bosch.

699
00:33:21,243 --> 00:33:23,863
我們雇了卡夫瑞先生幫我們鑒定一下
We hired Mr. Caffrey to authenticate it for us.

700
00:33:24,353 --> 00:33:25,233
這是扯什麼蛋
The hell you did.

701
00:33:25,243 --> 00:33:27,083
是我請的  給
Yes. I did. Here.

702
00:33:28,663 --> 00:33:30,923
卡夫瑞先生是傑出的藝術品專家
Mr. Caffrey is quite the art expert.

703
00:33:31,133 --> 00:33:34,263
甚至聯調局都請他當鑒定師
He's even worked for the FBI as an authenticator.

704
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:35,443
我點我可以作證
I can attest to that.

705
00:33:35,573 --> 00:33:36,963
如果他足以勝任你們的要求
And if he's good enough for you,

706
00:33:37,023 --> 00:33:38,033
當然也可以勝任我們的要求
He's good enough for me.

707
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:39,723
你也參與其中了
You're part of this?

708
00:33:40,133 --> 00:33:41,133
卡夫瑞先生
Well, Mr. Caffrey,

709
00:33:41,223 --> 00:33:44,213
你對本幅作品的專業評估如何
what's your professional assessment of this piece?

710
00:33:45,153 --> 00:33:47,563
絕對是拉斐爾真跡
That is definitely the real Raphael.

711
00:33:49,743 --> 00:33:51,133
我可以名譽保證
I'd stake my reputation on it.

712
00:33:51,513 --> 00:33:52,193
太好了
Excellent.

713
00:33:52,803 --> 00:33:55,403
你的酬勞  1200元
And for your services -- $1,200.

714
00:33:55,453 --> 00:33:57,743
抱歉了  尼爾在為我們工作期間不能
Sorry. Neal's not allowed to accept payment

715
00:33:57,743 --> 00:33:59,293
接受報酬
while he works for us.

716
00:33:59,543 --> 00:34:00,423
那更好了
Even better.

717
00:34:03,183 --> 00:34:05,363
-回見  卡夫瑞  -回見
- See you around, Caffrey. - See you around.

718
00:34:10,283 --> 00:34:11,193
你何不趕快回家
Why don't you head home?

719
00:34:11,723 --> 00:34:13,943
好好休息一下  明天是個關鍵的日子
Get some rest. Got a big day tomorrow.

720
00:34:14,683 --> 00:34:15,643
你這邊沒事兒吧
You gonna be okay?

721
00:34:16,213 --> 00:34:17,823
我沒事的  走吧
I'll be fine. Go.

722
00:34:21,883 --> 00:34:23,093
你背著我搞鬼
You went behind my back,

723
00:34:24,023 --> 00:34:25,963
密謀妨礙司法公正
conspired to obstruct justice.

724
00:34:26,003 --> 00:34:27,413
我可以說  你也一樣
I could say you did the same.

725
00:34:27,413 --> 00:34:28,903
醒醒吧  彼得  睜開眼看看吧
Wake up, Petey! Open your eyes!

726
00:34:28,963 --> 00:34:30,693
你不是他的拍檔  你是他的目標
You're not his partner. You're his mark!

727
00:34:31,123 --> 00:34:33,033
他最擅長騙取別人的信任
This boy's run such a good confidence game,

728
00:34:33,043 --> 00:34:33,893
他讓你以為
He's got you thinking

729
00:34:33,893 --> 00:34:35,603
這些是你想要的
that you've come out ahead in all this.

730
00:34:35,923 --> 00:34:37,993
你從什麼時候開始喪失對人性的信心了
When did you stop putting faith in people?

731
00:34:38,573 --> 00:34:39,813
從他們不配讓我相信時開始
When they stopped deserving it.

732
00:34:43,853 --> 00:34:45,083
這事兒沒完  彼得
This isn't over yet, Pete.

733
00:34:46,363 --> 00:34:47,153
絕對沒完
Not by a long shot.

734
00:34:57,103 --> 00:35:00,913
卡夫瑞先生  你應該獲得自由嗎
Mr. Caffrey, do you deserve to be free?

735
00:35:02,713 --> 00:35:03,703
這不是由我來決定的
That's not for me to decide.

736
00:35:05,893 --> 00:35:08,323
我不會坐在這裡給你演一出我已是
I won't sit here and give you some monologue

737
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:09,693
如何改過自新的獨角戲
about how reformed I am.

738
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:12,583
事實勝於雄辯
Actions speak louder than words,

739
00:35:12,963 --> 00:35:15,613
希望我在聯調局服務期間的事實
And, hopefully, my actions while in service to the FBI

740
00:35:15,623 --> 00:35:16,783
能勝於我的雄辯
say more than I can.

741
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:20,233
那你會如何利用你的自由呢
And what would you do with your freedom?

742
00:35:21,573 --> 00:35:22,493
有一件事我可以確定
I can tell you one thing.

743
00:35:22,493 --> 00:35:25,803
短時間內我哪裡都不會去
I won't be going anywhere anytime soon.

744
00:35:26,033 --> 00:35:27,233
-哪兒都不去  -沒錯
-You won't? -No.

745
00:35:27,933 --> 00:35:28,773
我在這裡很開心
I'm happy here.

746
00:35:30,443 --> 00:35:31,783
有人曾對我說過
You know, someone once told me

747
00:35:32,723 --> 00:35:35,593
我就像生活在美夢中  只是帶了腳環
my life is a dream with an anklet attached.

748
00:35:37,483 --> 00:35:39,823
如果我明天一覺醒來而腳環還在
If I wake up tomorrow and that anklet is still on --

749
00:35:40,853 --> 00:35:43,563
我有一份好工作  一間好住宅
I have a good job, a wonderful home...

750
00:35:45,213 --> 00:35:47,343
一名拍檔  一名知己
a partner and a best friend.

751
00:35:50,093 --> 00:35:50,813
一個家
A family.

752
00:35:54,783 --> 00:35:57,803
但是醒來後  給自己的答案
But to wake up and answer only to myself...

753
00:36:02,703 --> 00:36:03,823
對我來說意味著一切
That would mean everything.

754
00:36:06,233 --> 00:36:08,243
我們要與另一位面談一下
We have one more interview to conduct

755
00:36:08,303 --> 00:36:09,533
然後再做出決定
before we make our decision.

756
00:36:09,643 --> 00:36:12,023
今天下午五點前通知你答案
You'll have an answer here today by 5:00 p.m.

757
00:36:12,453 --> 00:36:13,093
謝謝
Thank you.

758
00:36:17,793 --> 00:36:18,553
情況怎麼樣
How'd it go?

759
00:36:19,753 --> 00:36:21,273
我感覺就那樣吧
As well as it could go, I think.

760
00:36:23,013 --> 00:36:24,253
你知道最棒的是什麼嗎
You know what the nice thing is?

761
00:36:26,233 --> 00:36:26,983
已經不重要了
It doesn't matter.

762
00:36:27,723 --> 00:36:28,393
什麼意思
What do you mean?

763
00:36:28,873 --> 00:36:30,633
你會走進去作證
You're gonna go in there and say your piece,

764
00:36:30,633 --> 00:36:32,063
委員會會作出決定
and the board's gonna make their decision.

765
00:36:33,283 --> 00:36:34,723
但不管有沒有腳環
But with or without my anklet,

766
00:36:35,173 --> 00:36:37,263
到了週一早上  我會走出電梯
come Monday morning, I'm gonna step off that elevator

767
00:36:37,263 --> 00:36:38,763
踏入21層的辦公室  開始工作
on the 21st floor and go to work.

768
00:36:42,343 --> 00:36:44,333
你曾對說我  你從未騙過我
You once told me you never lied to me

769
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:45,183
也永遠不會騙我
and you never will.

770
00:36:45,653 --> 00:36:46,873
現在我想知道一件事
So I need to know something.

771
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:52,023
克雷默和我第一次為德加畫作查你的時候
The first time Kramer and I went after you for the Degas,

772
00:36:53,223 --> 00:36:54,243
你是怎麼換掉畫作的
How'd you switch the paintings?

773
00:36:58,603 --> 00:37:00,993
我偷溜進頂層  偷梁換柱
I snuck up to the penthouse, pulled the swap,

774
00:37:00,993 --> 00:37:03,353
從樓頂跳傘  在華爾街著陸
then base-jumped off the building and landed on Wall Street.

775
00:37:05,883 --> 00:37:07,123
好吧  你沒說過
Fine. Don't tell me.

776
00:37:11,183 --> 00:37:11,953
我得走了
I got to go in.

777
00:37:15,074 --> 00:37:16,804
你在羅斯福島見的那個人
That person you saw on Roosevelt Island --

778
00:37:17,534 --> 00:37:18,104
是誰
Who was it?

779
00:37:21,924 --> 00:37:22,664
這事結束後
When this is over...

780
00:37:24,254 --> 00:37:25,234
我會全告訴我
I'll tell you everything.

781
00:37:28,604 --> 00:37:29,324
回見
See you soon.

782
00:37:57,094 --> 00:37:58,564
他們已經在等你了  博爾克探員
They're ready for you now, Agent Burke.

783
00:37:59,264 --> 00:38:00,044
謝了  亨利
Thanks, henry.

784
00:38:02,024 --> 00:38:02,804
這是幹什麼
What is this?

785
00:38:03,684 --> 00:38:05,584
這幾位執法官在等著尼爾·卡夫瑞一回來
These marshals are here to take Neal Caffrey

786
00:38:05,594 --> 00:38:06,944
就把他送進監獄
into custody when he returns.

787
00:38:07,764 --> 00:38:08,514
為了什麼
For what?

788
00:38:08,664 --> 00:38:10,134
你要是聽進去我的話就知道了
If you had only listened to me.

789
00:38:10,284 --> 00:38:12,424
-為了什麼  -危害公眾利益
- For what? - Public endangerment.

790
00:38:13,054 --> 00:38:14,814
我們有一堆證人能證明
I've got a dozen eyewitnesses

791
00:38:14,924 --> 00:38:16,624
他從纜車上跳了下來
who saw Caffrey hop that tram.

792
00:38:17,114 --> 00:38:21,144
再加上躲避逮捕  妨礙司法公正
Combine that with evading arrest, obstruction of justice.

793
00:38:21,144 --> 00:38:23,924
管他呢  也許再加條"亂穿馬路罪"來湊數
Hell, I may even throw in a jaywalking charge for good measure

794
00:38:24,314 --> 00:38:25,954
我們的工作可不是復仇
We're not in the revenge business.

795
00:38:26,424 --> 00:38:28,774
尼爾惹到你了  你就想傷害他
Neal pissed you off, and now you want to hurt him.

796
00:38:28,914 --> 00:38:29,764
只是要控制他
Just control him.

797
00:38:30,444 --> 00:38:31,944
尼爾有一堆的把柄
Neal's got a lot of skeletons.

798
00:38:32,244 --> 00:38:34,484
我抓住一塊  讓他套上腳環
I'll pick one, slap that anklet on him,

799
00:38:34,564 --> 00:38:36,974
就能讓他永遠留在華盛頓為我工作了
And he'll work for me in D.C. permanently.

800
00:38:39,554 --> 00:38:42,504
你明白這其實對大家都好  明白嗎
You understand this is best for everyone, don't you?

801
00:38:58,064 --> 00:38:58,704
明白嗎
Don't you?

802
00:39:02,424 --> 00:39:03,724
我要去作陳述了
I have a statement to make.

803
00:39:07,454 --> 00:39:09,414
請正式陳述你的姓名和
State your name and relationship to Neal Caffrey

804
00:39:09,414 --> 00:39:10,524
與尼爾·卡夫瑞的關係
for the record, please.

805
00:39:11,044 --> 00:39:12,484
特別探員彼得·博爾克
Special Agent Peter Burke.

806
00:39:12,704 --> 00:39:15,274
自從尼爾·卡夫瑞的監管權轉移過來後
I've been Neal Caffrey's handler at the Federal

807
00:39:15,294 --> 00:39:18,324
我一直是他在聯邦調查局的管理人
Bureau of Investigation since his release into our custody

808
00:39:18,904 --> 00:39:19,784
你抓到的他嗎
You caught him?

809
00:39:20,244 --> 00:39:21,054
抓了兩次
Twice.

810
00:39:21,914 --> 00:39:24,294
你們應該瞭解  上次我抓到他時
And you should know, the last time I caught him,

811
00:39:24,834 --> 00:39:26,914
他孤零零地坐在空蕩蕩的公寓裡
he was sitting alone in an empty apartment.

812
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,584
一無所有  無親無故
He had nothing. No one.

813
00:39:29,134 --> 00:39:29,874
現在呢
And now?

814
00:39:30,214 --> 00:39:32,514
他擁有了人生  在這裡有了真正的生活
He has a life. A real life here.

815
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:36,014
可以讓他腳踏實地  過體面的生活
One that keeps him grounded and decent.

816
00:39:36,644 --> 00:39:37,314
正如你們所聽到的
As you've heard,

817
00:39:37,314 --> 00:39:39,254
有很多人關心尼爾
there are many people who care about Neal,

818
00:39:39,334 --> 00:39:41,914
而不只是把他視為一名罪犯
people who see him as more than just a criminal.

819
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:44,464
我承認他會令我沮喪
He's frustrating, I'll admit.

820
00:39:44,464 --> 00:39:46,274
有時候會氣得我發瘋
He drives me crazy on his best days.

821
00:39:46,824 --> 00:39:48,534
我並不能永遠知道尼爾在哪裡
I don't always have to know where Neal is

822
00:39:48,534 --> 00:39:49,424
他想做什麼
or what he's up to.

823
00:39:49,514 --> 00:39:52,814
但我知道  他有一顆善良的心
But I do know that he has a good heart

824
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:55,774
有原則
and a set of principles...

825
00:39:55,884 --> 00:39:57,774
而六年前  當他只是扔到我桌子上
That weren't there six years ago when

826
00:39:57,784 --> 00:40:00,384
某案卷的嫌犯時  他並沒有這個
he was just another case file that got dropped on my desk.

827
00:40:01,734 --> 00:40:03,874
你以為卡夫瑞先生已經改過自新了嗎
Do you think Mr. Caffrey is reformed?

828
00:40:05,514 --> 00:40:08,414
只要他還帶著腳環  我們永遠無從得知
As long as he's on that anklet, we'll never know.

829
00:40:09,054 --> 00:40:10,774
我們可以在這裡坐到天荒地老
We can sit here until kingdom come

830
00:40:10,774 --> 00:40:12,574
辯論尼爾·卡夫瑞到底何許人也
and debate over who is Neal Caffrey.

831
00:40:13,234 --> 00:40:15,304
但只要我們還在栓著他
But as long as we keep him tethered,

832
00:40:15,304 --> 00:40:17,354
只要我們還視他為罪犯
as long as we treat him like a criminal,

833
00:40:18,104 --> 00:40:19,794
他就會永遠以為他真的是
He'll always think that he is one.

834
00:40:21,454 --> 00:40:25,754
無論尼爾是公民  是線人  還是竊賊
Whether Neal is a citizen, a C.I., or a thief

835
00:40:26,364 --> 00:40:29,454
這個決定必須要他自己來下
is a decision that needs to be put in his hands.

836
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:31,074
博爾克探員
Agent Burke...

837
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:34,684
-你好  -尼爾·卡夫瑞應該得到減刑嗎
- Hello?  - Should Neal Caffrey's sentence be commuted?

838
00:40:42,364 --> 00:40:43,204
是的
Yes.

839
00:40:44,254 --> 00:40:46,144
我認為尼爾應該得到自由
I'm saying Neal should be free.

840
00:40:47,814 --> 00:40:48,974
抱歉  事態緊急
I'm sorry -- this couldn't wait.

841
00:40:49,554 --> 00:40:51,014
彼得  卡夫瑞剪掉了腳環
Peter Caffrey's cut his anklet.

842
00:40:52,174 --> 00:40:52,864
尼爾走了
Neal's gone.
