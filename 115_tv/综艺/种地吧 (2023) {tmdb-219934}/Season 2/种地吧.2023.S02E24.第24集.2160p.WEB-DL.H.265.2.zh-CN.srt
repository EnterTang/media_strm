你父亲要我来接你
Your father sent me to come get you.

13
00:00:39,565 --> 00:00:43,092
我爸怎么会叫一个 他刚认识的人来接我?
Why would my dad send someone he'd just met to come get me?

14
00:00:43,202 --> 00:00:44,726
他信任我
He trusts me.

15
00:00:44,803 --> 00:00:46,285
我们越早离开
The sooner we leave, the sooner

19
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,207
-你被卸职了
- You've been removed from office.

20
00:00:53,278 --> 00:00:57,544
这个证据 被彼得金斯利所利用
The evidence was manipulated by a man named Peter Kingsley.

21
00:00:57,616 --> 00:00:59,811
我要你尽全力调查这个人
I need you to find out all you can about him.

22
00:00:59,918 --> 00:01:01,143
-怎么帮你?
- What happens now?

23
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,787
-只剩最后一招， 交出金斯利
- We got one last play. Deliver Kingsley.

24
00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:07,381
他这人极端危险 而且你没办法接近他
He's far too dangerous, and you'll never get close to him.

25
00:01:07,459 --> 00:01:10,223
说的对， 是你不是我去
You're right. I won't, but you will.

26
00:01:10,295 --> 00:01:12,627
金斯利不知道修特已死
Kingsley doesn't know Hewitt's dead.

27
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:14,136
就说你要交出修特
If you say you can deliver him,

28
00:01:14,137 --> 00:01:15,496
就会引起他的兴趣
that should get his attention.

29
00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:18,001
我要我们谈话的录音带
I want the tapes that you made of our conversation.

30
00:01:18,103 --> 00:01:19,900
我会用修特做交换
I'll give you Alex Hewitt in return.

31
00:01:19,972 --> 00:01:23,169
洛城体育馆 18号出入口， 30分钟

- What support will you get from CTU? - As of now, none. Ow!

33
00:01:28,147 --> 00:01:30,342
Jack? Jack!

34
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:37,598
以下是发生在早上 7点至8点的事

35
00:01:46,432 --> 00:01:48,992
还好吗?
- You OK? - Yeah.

36
00:01:56,475 --> 00:01:58,807
快呀
Come on.

37
00:01:58,877 --> 00:02:02,836
车子发不动 我们下车
Dammit. The car won't start. We gotta get out of here.

38
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,683
安全带卡住了
My seat belt's jammed.

39
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:12,621
派默夫人， 请你帮我
Mrs Palmer, I'm gonna need your help.

40
00:02:15,194 --> 00:02:16,957
请不要这样
Mrs Palmer, please don't do this.

41
00:02:17,029 --> 00:02:20,055
抱歉， 我得顾我自己
I'm sorry, but I have to take care of myself.

42
00:02:20,165 --> 00:02:22,190
等我可以了我会叫救护车
When I'm free I'll call an ambulance.

43
00:02:22,301 --> 00:02:26,135
-不可以这样 -别无选择
- You can't do this! - I don't have a choice.

44
00:02:26,205 --> 00:02:27,968
你很棒， 可惜你对善恶太分明
You're a very impressive man, but you see everything

45
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,135
就像大卫一样
as either good or bad, just like David.

46
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:34,737
-这世界是很复杂的 -是很简单的
- The world is so much more complicated. - No, it's simple.

47
00:02:34,847 --> 00:02:36,886
一场战争快要开始了
There's a war about to start and you're

48
00:02:36,887 --> 00:02:38,978
你是唯一可以帮我阻止此事的人
the only person who can help me stop it.

49
00:02:39,051 --> 00:02:43,317
-不为总统吗? -他离弃了我
- What about the president? - He turned away from me.

50
00:02:43,388 --> 00:02:46,316
25年的生活， 建立的家庭
After 25 years of building a life together,

51
00:02:46,317 --> 00:02:48,224
他却离弃了我
a family, he turned me away.

52
00:02:48,327 --> 00:02:51,091
他们最后还是会知道是你的
Eventually they will connect you to this conspiracy.

53
00:02:51,196 --> 00:02:53,687
核弹本来是不该引爆的
That bomb was never supposed to go off.

54
00:02:53,765 --> 00:02:56,825
事情本来不该是这样的
None of this was supposed to happen this way.

55
00:02:56,902 --> 00:03:01,362
我知道， 我相信你 但你可以阻止此事的
I know. I believe you. You can put an end to it now.

56
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,146
帮我捉到金斯利
If you help me get Kingsley,

57
00:03:03,147 --> 00:03:05,707
你丈夫会重新出任总统
your husband will get his presidency back.

58
00:03:05,777 --> 00:03:08,245
那会是你的功劳
That will be because of you.

59
00:03:08,347 --> 00:03:10,838
派默夫人， 求求你
Mrs Palmer, please.

60
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:13,407
Goddamnit!

61
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:31,425
你要我怎么做?
What do you want me to do?

62
00:03:31,537 --> 00:03:35,871
置物箱里面有小刀 帮我割开
There's a knife in the glove box. Help cut me out.

63
00:03:40,112 --> 00:03:41,579
进来吧
Come on in.

64
00:03:41,647 --> 00:03:43,973
这样好多了， 比较简单
This is much better. It's simpler.

65
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,642
我们必须想办法说明
We gotta be able to explain this thing.

66
00:03:46,752 --> 00:03:48,587
-麦克， 我有事跟你说
- I need to talk to you, Mike.

67
00:03:48,588 --> 00:03:50,484
-我五分钟后下来
- I'll be down in five minutes.

68
00:03:50,589 --> 00:03:52,386
麦克
Mike.

69
00:03:52,457 --> 00:03:54,118
很重要
It's important.

70
00:03:56,261 --> 00:03:57,626
失陪一下
Excuse me.

71
00:04:10,242 --> 00:04:11,903
什么事?
What is it?

72
00:04:11,977 --> 00:04:13,549
这是金斯利的档案
It's a file on Peter Kingsley.

73
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,436
几分钟前调出来的
They pulled it up a few minutes ago.

74
00:04:15,514 --> 00:04:19,508
杰克鲍尔 认为一切都是他主使的
Peter Kingsley, the man Jack Bauer thinks is behind the bomb.

75
00:04:19,618 --> 00:04:21,623
他在约六小时前打电话
There's a record of phone calls he made,

76
00:04:21,624 --> 00:04:25,180
给一名叫做乔纳森华的军人
as recently as six hours ago, to a soldier named Jonathan Wallace.

77
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,453
那军人就是 珊瑚蛇突袭队的人
Wallace was a member of the Coral Snake brigade.

78
00:04:28,527 --> 00:04:31,257
明显的是他杀了自己人
He apparently killed his own men.

79
00:04:32,331 --> 00:04:34,595
我知道他是谁
I know who Wallace is.

80
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:38,500
轰炸机刚通过最后的哨站
The planes have passed over their final checkpoint

81
00:04:38,604 --> 00:04:41,129
一小时内就会到达目的地
and will reach their targets within the hour.

82
00:04:41,206 --> 00:04:43,367
主攻击目标是军事单位
Our primary targets are all military,

83
00:04:43,475 --> 00:04:46,008
但那是个位于住宅区域
but one includes a command-and-control

84
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:48,209
的指挥中心
center inside a residential area.

85
00:04:48,313 --> 00:04:50,913
不论我们武器有多精确
As smart as our weapons have become,

86
00:04:50,914 --> 00:04:53,514
都会产生间接伤害
there may be some collateral damage.

87
00:04:54,553 --> 00:04:57,113
会伤到平民
You mean civilian casualties.

88
00:04:57,189 --> 00:04:58,451
Yes, sir.

89
00:04:59,691 --> 00:05:03,183
-无可避免吗? -没办法
- There's no way to avoid these? - I'm afraid not.

90
00:05:06,031 --> 00:05:09,296
那我们就只好这么办
Then it's something we're just gonna have to live with.

91
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:14,663
我是查裴尔
Ryan Chappelle.

92
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:19,473
-我是麦克纳维 -有什么事， 长官?
- Ryan, this is Mike Novick. - How can I help you, sir?

93
00:05:19,544 --> 00:05:22,211
我知道有人对有关塞浦路斯
I know there's been some confusion today

94
00:05:22,212 --> 00:05:24,812
录音的真假有所争议
about the veracity of the Cyprus audio.

95
00:05:24,883 --> 00:05:26,372
不是的，我们的鉴定
Not really. Our teams came

96
00:05:26,373 --> 00:05:28,320
与兰利那边的是一样的
to the same conclusion as Langley.

97
00:05:28,387 --> 00:05:31,038
那鲍尔还在寻找
Do you know if Bauer's still trying to find

98
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,690
伪造录音的证据吗?
evidence that the recording was fabricated?

99
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,819
对， 他未经授权
Yes, but he's operating outside our authority.

100
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,557
我要你协助他的调查
I want you to assist his investigation.

101
00:05:39,665 --> 00:05:43,999
-长官， 我根本不知道他在哪里 -那就找到他
- Sir, I don't even know where he is. - Then find him.

102
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:46,833
为何要我这么做?
I'm not sure why you're asking me to do this.

103
00:05:46,905 --> 00:05:49,772
我们不是该准备作战吗?
I was told we're at war and to proceed accordingly.

104
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,124
还没有
We're not at war yet.

105
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,505
30分钟内给我
You have 30 minutes to report back to me

106
00:05:53,578 --> 00:05:55,773
杰克所找到的结果
the findings of Bauer and your efforts.

107
00:05:55,881 --> 00:05:58,213
-可是长官... -这是命令
- But sir... - That's a direct order, Ryan.

108
00:05:58,283 --> 00:06:02,413
你知道我的联络方式 用这条专线回报给我
You have my channel. Call me back on this line. That's all.

109
00:06:06,425 --> 00:06:09,917
-我要过一小时才上飞机 -为何要延迟?
- I'll be on the plane in an hour. - Why the delay?

110
00:06:10,028 --> 00:06:12,326
核弹引爆地点不对
The bomb detonating in the wrong location

111
00:06:12,327 --> 00:06:13,897
所以有些额外的工作
created a little extra work.

112
00:06:13,965 --> 00:06:16,365
不必担心什么， 我希望
Nothing to worry about, I hope.

113
00:06:16,435 --> 00:06:19,029
不会的 我不想烦你了
Not at all. I won't bore you with the details.

114
00:06:19,104 --> 00:06:21,095
你讲
Bore me.

115
00:06:22,274 --> 00:06:25,038
我还得处理修特
I still have to take care of Alex Hewitt.

116
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,273
修特是唯一的证人了
Hewitt is the only one who can bring this whole thing down.

117
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,120
-你不是说已经处理掉他了
- You told me you'd have him by now.

118
00:06:30,121 --> 00:06:31,475
-我找不到他
- I wasn't able to find him.

119
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:34,916
我会处理的 别担心
But I'm taking care of it. Don't worry.

120
00:06:42,794 --> 00:06:44,819
你们俩， 坐下
Sit down, both of you.

121
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,442
你不必对付蜜雪儿
You don't need Michelle here.

122
00:06:46,443 --> 00:06:48,059
她只是听命行事
She was acting under my orders.

123
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:51,625
-我自己来讲 -我要你们坐下
- I can defend myself, Tony. - I said sit down.

124
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:02,576
我要你们帮我 联络杰克鲍尔
I need you to get me in contact with Jack Bauer.

125
00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:06,952
我明白了， 杰克上面有人支持
Oh, I see. Jack got some support above you

126
00:07:06,953 --> 00:07:09,686
现在你有压力了
and now you're being squeezed, right?

127
00:07:09,788 --> 00:07:12,279
-到底办不办得到?
Can you do it or not?

128
00:07:12,357 --> 00:07:14,484
-是怎么一回事?
What's goin' on?

129
00:07:15,794 --> 00:07:19,423
或许杰克找到的证据是真的
Bauer's evidence might actually have some relevance.

130
00:07:19,498 --> 00:07:20,988
-所以我们是对的
- Which means we were right.

131
00:07:20,989 --> 00:07:22,957
-不， 你们差点害死我
- No. You damn near put me in a coma.

132
00:07:23,034 --> 00:07:25,332
竟敢攻击我
That's assault.

133
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:33,339
我告诉你 你不要对付我们
I'll tell you what. You drop the charges against us...

134
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,513
我们就会帮你
and we'll help you.

135
00:07:41,353 --> 00:07:46,017
少来了， 雷恩 所有人都会建议你这么做的
Come on, Ryan. You of all people know that's your best move.

136
00:07:51,963 --> 00:07:54,488
-好吧 -白纸黑字
- Fine. - In writing.

137
00:07:54,566 --> 00:07:58,866
好的， 写下来 快帮我找到鲍尔
All right, in writing. Just get me in touch with Bauer.

138
00:08:02,374 --> 00:08:04,349
-不找人支援吗?
- Shouldn't we call for help?

139
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,074
-我现在不是听命于反恐小组
- I'm not working under CTU's authority.

140
00:08:07,179 --> 00:08:10,205
-对他们来说我并不存在 -所以我们只能靠自己
- To them I don't exist. - So we're out on our own.

141
00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:11,976
完全靠自己
Completely.

142
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:15,508
-你还好吗?需要帮助吗? -他受伤了
- Are you all right? You need some help? - He got hurt.

143
00:08:15,587 --> 00:08:18,647
-可以送我们到医院去吗? -好的， 当然
- Can you get us to a hospital? - Uh, yeah, sure.

144
00:08:18,723 --> 00:08:21,988
-派默夫人， 你来开车 -什么意思?
- Mrs Palmer, you need to drive. - What do you mean?

145
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,909
-抱歉， 我们要用你的车
- Sorry, but we need your car.

146
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,498
-别紧张， 拿去， 开走吧
- Hey, easy, all right? Go ahead, take it.

147
00:08:29,534 --> 00:08:31,729
谢谢
Thank you.

148
00:08:51,223 --> 00:08:53,555
已经好了， 长官
They're ready, sir.

149
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,967
-我姓华纳， 嗨， 卡丽你好 -嗨， 凯蒂
- Miss Warner. Hi. Carrie Turner. - Hi. Kate.

150
00:09:09,074 --> 00:09:11,804
-你一定就是杰克的女儿 -我爸在哪里?
- You must be Jack's daughter Kim. - Where's my dad?

151
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,177
他还在外面， 等一下
He's still in the field. Wait here.

152
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:16,575
我去告诉查裴尔你们来了
I'll tell Ryan Chappelle you're here.

153
00:09:16,648 --> 00:09:20,209
-让我来处理 -你不是被看管了
- I'll handle this. - I thought you were in custody.

154
00:09:20,285 --> 00:09:23,049
已经释放了
I was released.

155
00:09:23,722 --> 00:09:28,091
琴， 我知道出了什么事 你还好吧?
Kim, I heard what happened to you. Are you all right?

156
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:31,001
应该没事， 我想看我爸爸
Yeah, I guess so. Look, I just wanna see

157
00:09:31,002 --> 00:09:33,063
我要知道他是否有事
my dad and make sure he's OK.

158
00:09:33,131 --> 00:09:34,633
他现在不在
No, he's not here right now.

159
00:09:34,634 --> 00:09:36,727
要几个小时才会回来
He won't be back for a couple of hours.

160
00:09:36,801 --> 00:09:38,045
-他知道我在这儿吗?
- Does he know I'm here?

161
00:09:38,046 --> 00:09:40,067
-他若来电我们会告诉他
- No. We'll tell him when he phones in.

162
00:09:40,138 --> 00:09:42,742
-杰克说我们一到达就要打给他
- Jack insisted we call as soon as we get here.

163
00:09:42,743 --> 00:09:44,405
-现在电话接不通
- He's just not reachable now.

164
00:09:44,476 --> 00:09:46,336
卡丽会带你们到后面休息
I'll have Carrie take you back and

165
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:48,743
我马上就过来
get you situated. I'll be there in a minute.

166
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,113
不会有事的
It's gonna be OK.

167
00:09:56,821 --> 00:09:58,516
OK.

168
00:10:00,592 --> 00:10:02,583
华纳小姐?
Miss Warner?

169
00:10:03,995 --> 00:10:06,429
不知你是否知道
I don't know if you're aware of this but...

170
00:10:06,498 --> 00:10:10,025
你父亲被释放后有回来
your father came back here after we released him.

171
00:10:10,135 --> 00:10:11,124
为什么?
Why?

172
00:10:11,202 --> 00:10:14,694
他要在你妹妹被带走前 和她讲几句话
He wanted to talk to your sister before she was taken away.

173
00:10:14,806 --> 00:10:18,333
玛莉被带到这边吗?
- They brought Marie back here? - Yeah.

174
00:10:25,617 --> 00:10:28,381
你欺骗了我?
You lied to me?

175
00:10:28,486 --> 00:10:31,182
你杀了理沙?
You killed Reza?

176
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,455
还想杀你姐姐?
You tried to kill your own sister?

177
00:10:35,527 --> 00:10:38,821
你真的想引爆核弹
You were willing to set off a nuclear bomb

178
00:10:38,822 --> 00:10:41,489
害死上千万人?
in a city with ten million people?

179
00:10:45,704 --> 00:10:50,038
告诉我为什么? 因为我必须了解
You tell me why. Because I need to understand.

180
00:10:52,377 --> 00:10:55,132
告诉我你是被逼的
Tell me that they forced you to do it, that they

181
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:57,543
你被洗脑了，你受到威胁
brainwashed you, that they threatened you.

182
00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:02,052
告诉我你不知道 自己在做什么
You can tell me that you didn't know what you were doin'.

183
00:11:03,722 --> 00:11:06,555
一定是有理由的
There must be a reason.

184
00:11:07,425 --> 00:11:10,019
没有理由， 爸爸
There is no reason, Dad.

185
00:11:14,933 --> 00:11:17,561
我不能接受
I can't accept that.

186
00:11:24,075 --> 00:11:26,066
我也不能
I couldn't either.

187
00:11:27,445 --> 00:11:30,927
当时她举起枪对着我要扣扳机
Until I looked into her eyes and she pointed

188
00:11:30,928 --> 00:11:34,410
我看着她的眼睛
a gun at me and started to pull the trigger.

189
00:11:39,024 --> 00:11:41,015
相信我， 爸爸
Trust me, Dad.

190
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,193
她不会回答你的
She's not gonna give you any answers.

191
00:11:46,131 --> 00:11:50,898
她无法做到 那是我们无法理解的原因
She can't. At least, nothing that we could ever understand.

192
00:12:06,117 --> 00:12:07,778
爸...
Dad...

193
00:12:12,457 --> 00:12:14,948
好了 我们走
Come on. Let's go.

194
00:12:34,979 --> 00:12:36,640
凯蒂
Kate.

195
00:13:12,517 --> 00:13:15,350
你以为在外面会安全
You think you'll be safe out there.

196
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,681
其实不然
You won't be.

197
00:13:36,508 --> 00:13:39,306
-我是东尼 -你复职了吗?
- Jack, it's Tony. - Tony, you back in play?

198
00:13:39,377 --> 00:13:41,971
琴已经到这里了
Yeah. Jack, Kim's here at CTU.

199
00:13:42,046 --> 00:13:46,210
-她很安全 -谢谢老天， 别告诉她我的事
- She's safe. - Thank God. Don't tell her what's going on.

200
00:13:46,317 --> 00:13:49,150
-就说我很快会回来 -我会的
- Just say I'll be back as soon as I can. - I will.

201
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,656
-我是雷恩， 我们得谈谈 -你这浑蛋
- Jack, this is Ryan. We need to talk. - You son of a bitch.

202
00:13:52,724 --> 00:13:55,352
是你阻止救援的直升机
You stopped that chopper picking up me and Hewitt.

203
00:13:55,426 --> 00:13:57,903
-害修特死掉， 这要你负责
- Hewitt's dead. I hold you responsible.

204
00:13:57,904 --> 00:13:59,761
-现在不一样了
- Listen, things have changed.

205
00:13:59,864 --> 00:14:03,493
你有完全的支持 告诉我现在的任务
You got full support. Give me your mission profile.

206
00:14:04,836 --> 00:14:06,827
我要去见金斯利
I've set up a meeting with Kingsley.

207
00:14:06,905 --> 00:14:09,703
在洛城体育馆18号出入口
We're gonna meet him at the LA Coliseum, gate 18.

208
00:14:09,774 --> 00:14:12,174
派默夫人会让他确认
Mrs Palmer will wear a wire and make him confirm

209
00:14:12,243 --> 00:14:14,939
事情与那三个国家无关
that the three countries had nothing to do with the nuke.

210
00:14:15,046 --> 00:14:17,296
想办法撑到后援到达
Stand down until you get some support.

211
00:14:17,297 --> 00:14:19,074
很快就会到了
Our people will be there soon.

212
00:14:19,184 --> 00:14:20,837
没时间了
We don't have time.

213
00:14:20,838 --> 00:14:22,712
现在就要和金斯利会面了
Kingsley's expecting the meet to go down now.

214
00:14:22,787 --> 00:14:24,778
你需要后援
You need backup.

215
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:28,007
你想帮忙， 就找出金斯利
If you wanna help me, get me voice prints of

216
00:14:28,008 --> 00:14:31,056
与派默夫人的声纹做确认
Kingsley and Mrs Palmer for authentication.

217
00:14:31,129 --> 00:14:32,357
好了
Done.

218
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,622
-还要与白宫现场语音传输
- And a live audio feed to the White House.

219
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,765
-需要通到总统吗?
- You want an audience with the president.

220
00:14:36,868 --> 00:14:39,098
Yes.

221
00:14:39,204 --> 00:14:41,468
好吧， 线路不要断掉
All right. Keep the line clear.

222
00:14:41,573 --> 00:14:44,273
-收到， 我们要进体育馆了
- Copy. We're pulling into the Coliseum now.

223
00:14:44,274 --> 00:14:47,035
-赶快派迅雷小组到那里去
- We need to get a SWAT team to his location.

224
00:14:53,218 --> 00:14:55,709
停在那里
Pull over there.

225
00:14:58,122 --> 00:15:00,613
在这里等我
Wait here for me.

226
00:15:14,405 --> 00:15:16,396
过来
Come on.

227
00:15:21,813 --> 00:15:24,805
我帮你装窃听器
Let's get you wired.

228
00:15:29,287 --> 00:15:32,154
脱掉外套
Take yourjacket off your shoulder.

229
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:36,284
这是无线发讯器
This is a wireless transmitter.

230
00:15:36,361 --> 00:15:39,194
不会被他们知道
They won't know to look for it.

231
00:15:39,195 --> 00:15:42,028
也不会被发现
They won't be able to trace it.

232
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:44,950
-这太疯狂了， 不能单独行动
- This is crazy. We shouldn't do this alone.

233
00:15:44,951 --> 00:15:46,935
-别无选择
- We don't have another choice.

234
00:15:47,005 --> 00:15:48,898
金斯利没有见到
Remember, Kingsley doesn't want

235
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:50,669
修特不会走的
to leave here without Hewitt.

236
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:53,869
这就是我们的优势
That's gotta be to our advantage.

237
00:15:59,951 --> 00:16:02,545
讲话
OK, say something.

238
00:16:02,654 --> 00:16:04,713
我好怕
I'm scared.

239
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,858
可以用
OK, it's working.

240
00:16:20,872 --> 00:16:22,362
总统先生
- Yes, Mike. - Mr President,

241
00:16:22,473 --> 00:16:25,031
我现在推翻自己
I am against any delay in our military actions.

242
00:16:25,032 --> 00:16:26,501
从一开始反对延迟开打的立场
I have been from the start.

243
00:16:26,577 --> 00:16:29,638
因为现在很有机会取得
But there is a good chance we'll receive

244
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,006
伪造塞浦路斯录音的证据
evidence soon the Cyprus recording is false.

245
00:16:33,084 --> 00:16:36,520
我们都知道第二波带了核弹入境
We know Second Wave brought the nuke into the country

246
00:16:36,587 --> 00:16:38,383
也知道这一切
and we know they're sponsored by

247
00:16:38,384 --> 00:16:40,684
都是那三个国家赞助的
these three countries. What am I missing?

248
00:16:40,758 --> 00:16:42,436
虽然现在还没有细节
I don't have all the details,

249
00:16:42,437 --> 00:16:44,752
但我刚发现一个线索
but I just learned about a possible link

250
00:16:44,862 --> 00:16:48,662
第二波与一个 叫金斯利的男子有关联
between Second Wave and a man named Peter Kingsley.

251
00:16:48,733 --> 00:16:50,325
他是谁?
Who is he?

252
00:16:50,401 --> 00:16:56,034
他控制里海油田
He's apparently part of a consortium of oil interests 
with contracts in the Caspian Sea.

253
00:16:56,107 --> 00:16:58,166
是油田的人主使核弹的吗?
An oil consortium's behind the nuke?

254
00:16:58,242 --> 00:17:00,544
鲍尔相信他能让金斯利讲出实话
Bauer believes he can get a confession

255
00:17:00,545 --> 00:17:03,271
他要现场语音连线
from Kingsley. He's set up a live audio feed.

256
00:17:03,381 --> 00:17:06,783
轰炸机再20分钟就要轰炸了
Our bombers are due to drop their payloads
 in less than 20 minutes.

257
00:17:06,884 --> 00:17:09,944
鲍尔马上要和他会面了
Bauer's meeting Kingsley any minute.

258
00:17:11,255 --> 00:17:14,088
这是现场语音声纹传送
This is the live voice print.

259
00:17:14,192 --> 00:17:18,424
这是纪录上的对照语音档
And this is the voice file we have on record

260
00:17:18,529 --> 00:17:24,126
这可以证明说话的人 的确是雪莉派默
which will prove that it is, in fact, Sherry Palmer.

261
00:17:24,235 --> 00:17:26,567
-确认了 -下面这个是金斯利?
- It's confirmed. - The one below is Kingsley?

262
00:17:26,637 --> 00:17:29,435
-你们收得到吗?
- Yeah. - Are you guys getting this?

263
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,236
-很清楚 -多久后援会到?
- We're good here. - How far out is our backup?

264
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,606
-11分钟
- They're 11 minutes out.

265
00:17:33,607 --> 00:17:35,576
-太久了， 现在就要进去了
- That's too long. We've gotta go now.

266
00:17:35,646 --> 00:17:37,705
-等一下 -不行
- Just wait. - We can't.

267
00:17:37,782 --> 00:17:39,582
我们已经迟到10分钟
We're already ten minutes past

268
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,742
普雷斯科特准备好了吗?
the meeting time. Is Prescott ready?

269
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:43,551
东尼已经接上白宫
Tony's on with the White House.

270
00:17:43,552 --> 00:17:45,620
正在设定现场语音传送
They're setting up a live audio feed.

271
00:17:45,723 --> 00:17:47,315
好， 那一切就搞定了
OK, good. We are set to go.

272
00:17:50,561 --> 00:17:52,961
你那边如何?派默夫人?
How are you doing, Mrs Palmer?

273
00:17:53,064 --> 00:17:56,295
万一金斯利要杀我呢?
What's to prevent Kingsley from shooting me?

274
00:17:56,401 --> 00:17:58,892
没看到修特之前 他不会动手的
He won't do anything until he gets Hewitt.

275
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:03,430
但是一旦他发现 修特不在我们手上...
But the moment he realizes we don't have Hewitt...

276
00:18:03,508 --> 00:18:05,942
我会掩护你的
I'll be covering your back.

277
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:11,108
你这种状况 让我不能安心
That's not very comforting considering the condition you're in.

278
00:18:11,182 --> 00:18:13,673
我可能不会活着走出来
I may not make it out of this.

279
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,813
我不想骗你 那是有可能的
I'm not gonna lie to you, Mrs Palmer. That's a possibility.

280
00:18:26,764 --> 00:18:30,700
我这么做是为了大卫 你很清楚， 对不对?
I'm doing this for David. You know that, don't you?

281
00:18:33,004 --> 00:18:34,631
对
Yes.

282
00:18:34,705 --> 00:18:38,698
你会告诉他吗? 万一出了什么事情
Will you tell him that? In case something happens.

283
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:46,012
我会的， 派默夫人 你过去吧
I'll take care of it, Mrs Palmer. You've gotta go now.

284
00:19:16,147 --> 00:19:17,580
-麦克 -是的， 长官
- Mike. - Yes, sir.

285
00:19:17,682 --> 00:19:19,531
传输连线已经准备好了
We just finished setting up the feed.

286
00:19:19,532 --> 00:19:21,881
希望这不是浪费时间
I hope this isn't gonna be a waste of our time.

287
00:19:21,986 --> 00:19:24,682
相信我， 总统先生 我也一样
Believe me, Mr President, so do I.

288
00:19:28,593 --> 00:19:30,754
怎么了， 麦克?
What's going on, Mike?

289
00:19:31,762 --> 00:19:35,027
总统与我都觉得这件事 应该也让你参与
The president and I thought you should be part of this.

290
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:37,469
普雷斯科特与司法部长
Along with Prescott and the Attorney General,

291
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,366
都会一起听现场语音传送
we will be listening to a live feed.

292
00:19:39,437 --> 00:19:43,203
-听什么? -对付彼得金斯利的秘密行动
- Of what? - A sting operation against Peter Kingsley.

293
00:19:43,274 --> 00:19:46,038
他主使核弹之事
It appears he was the architect of today's bombing

294
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,874
并以塞浦路斯录音栽赃
and the delivery of the Cyprus audio.

295
00:19:50,882 --> 00:19:52,873
鲍尔找到金斯利
- Bauer found Kingsley. - Yes.

296
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:57,717
但是要与金斯利对话的 不是鲍尔
But it won't be Bauer who'll be talking to Kingsley.

297
00:19:58,523 --> 00:20:00,609
只要能让他认罪
What difference does it make

298
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,962
也没什么差别
as long as we get him to incriminate himself?

299
00:20:04,795 --> 00:20:06,456
有什么事?麦克
What is it, Mike?

300
00:20:13,804 --> 00:20:17,296
是雪莉要与金斯利对谈
It's Sherry who'll be talking to Kingsley.

301
00:20:18,376 --> 00:20:20,207
我不懂
I don't understand.

302
00:20:20,278 --> 00:20:25,272
看来几个月前 金斯利找了她串通
It seems that Kingsley recruited her some months ago.

303
00:20:25,383 --> 00:20:28,045
她也参与其中
She was part of this.

304
00:20:30,488 --> 00:20:33,423
雪莉为金斯利工作?
Sherry was working with this man, Kingsley?

305
00:20:33,491 --> 00:20:35,288
看似如此， 长官
It appears that way, sir.

306
00:20:36,627 --> 00:20:39,323
引爆核弹并挑起战争? 不会的
To detonate a nuclear bomb and start a war?

307
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,954
No.

308
00:20:41,065 --> 00:20:45,502
目前不清楚她了解多少 或牵涉有多深
It's unclear how much she knew, or how deep she was in it.

309
00:20:46,337 --> 00:20:50,934
希望她能引出金斯利认罪
We just have to hope she can extract a confession from Kingsley.

310
00:20:51,008 --> 00:20:53,507
现在雪莉与鲍尔配合
So now Sherry is working with Jack Bauer

311
00:20:53,508 --> 00:20:54,945
要把金斯利引出来吗?
to bring down Kingsley?

312
00:20:55,012 --> 00:20:59,005
她要冒相当的危险
Yes. And at considerable risk to herself.

313
00:21:54,805 --> 00:21:57,797
史考特 我没有指示前别动作
Scott, don't do anything until I tell you to.

314
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:00,537
-我们需要修特 -了解
- We need Hewitt. - Understood.

315
00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:01,534
-修特在哪里? -他很安全
- Where's Hewitt? - He's safe.

316
00:23:02,873 --> 00:23:03,931
他在哪里?
Where is he?

317
00:23:04,775 --> 00:23:08,768
你骗我， 你根本 就计划要引爆核弹
You lied to me. You wanted this bomb to go off all along.

318
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:13,074
你利用了我与罗杰斯坦顿
You used Roger Stanton and you used me.

319
00:23:14,452 --> 00:23:15,714
是的， 没错
Yes, I did.

320
00:23:15,786 --> 00:23:18,090
现在我被你牵连
Well, now I'm tied to you, and

321
00:23:18,091 --> 00:23:21,316
也与核弹牵连，我要求自保
the nuclear detonation. I want safe haven.

322
00:23:21,425 --> 00:23:25,054
-那是你的问题 -现在是你的了
- That's your problem. - Well, I just made it yours.

323
00:23:25,129 --> 00:23:27,723
我若出事 你也别想见到修特
Because you won't see Hewitt until I'm safe.

324
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:31,928
-你别想骗我 -你也别当我是呆子
- Don't horse trade with me. - Don't insult my intelligence.

325
00:23:32,002 --> 00:23:36,268
-找到符合金斯利的声音 -雷恩， 听到没
- We got a match on Kingsley's voice. - Ryan, you got it.

326
00:23:37,775 --> 00:23:40,767
不交出修特你就别想走
You're not going anywhere till I have Hewitt.

327
00:23:40,845 --> 00:23:42,972
这不是让你来决定的
That doesn't work for me.

328
00:23:47,017 --> 00:23:49,971
等我离开到安全之处
I'll call you on this line to give you

329
00:23:49,972 --> 00:23:53,082
我才会打电话告诉你他在哪里
Hewitt's location after I'm safely away.

330
00:23:53,157 --> 00:23:55,182
我不会让你知道我的行踪
You don't need to know where I'm going.

331
00:23:55,292 --> 00:23:57,970
-没有我们要听的
- We're not getting what we need here.

332
00:23:57,971 --> 00:23:59,662
-她会问出来的
- She'll get it for you.

333
00:24:04,835 --> 00:24:07,816
-录音带的问题要解决
- Now there's the matter of the recordings.

334
00:24:07,817 --> 00:24:09,273
-都在这里
- They're right here.

335
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:13,003
我们之间所有的通话录音
Every phone conversation between you and me.

336
00:24:16,013 --> 00:24:20,507
不， 我要全部 包括塞浦路斯的
No. I want all of them, including Cyprus.

337
00:24:23,287 --> 00:24:25,778
为什么?那与你无关
Why Cyprus? You had nothing to do with that.

338
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:29,053
要保障
- lnsurance. - lnsurance?

339
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,728
只要一开战
Once the country goes to war, the

340
00:24:31,729 --> 00:24:34,997
政府也不会发表此证据的
government will never let that be exposed.

341
00:24:35,065 --> 00:24:38,125
修特是唯一能伤害我们的人
Hewitt is the only one who can hurt us.

342
00:24:38,202 --> 00:24:41,171
-因为录音是他伪造的 -对
- Because he forged the Cyprus recording. - Right.

343
00:24:41,238 --> 00:24:43,544
-证据都有了， 我们走
- You got your proof. Let me go ahead.

344
00:24:43,545 --> 00:24:45,972
-让白宫先确认
- Get it confirmed from the White House.

345
00:24:46,043 --> 00:24:49,672
-她必须赶快抽身 -满意了吗?
- She can't stay much longer. - Are you satisfied?

346
00:24:49,747 --> 00:24:53,080
反恐小组要知道 这样的证据是否充分
CTU wants to know if that's enough to prove it.

347
00:24:53,184 --> 00:24:55,013
有确认过这声音真的是现场
Have you confirmed this is live

348
00:24:55,014 --> 00:24:57,315
并通过鉴定?
and the voices have been authenticated?

349
00:24:57,388 --> 00:24:59,686
是的， 长官
Yes, sir.

350
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:04,660
那就够了
- So that's it. - Yes.

351
00:25:04,728 --> 00:25:08,220
等我降落， 我再打电话给你
When I land... I'll call you.

352
00:25:12,236 --> 00:25:16,366
你在唬我 修特根本就不在你手上
You're bluffin'. You don't have Hewitt, do you?

353
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,102
-是真的 -不， 是假的
- Oh, yes, I do. - No, you don't.

354
00:25:25,749 --> 00:25:28,513
史考特， 杀了她
Scott, take her out.

355
00:25:37,261 --> 00:25:39,252
干掉她
Kill her.

356
00:25:46,937 --> 00:25:49,201
雪莉， 快跑
Run, Sherry!

357
00:26:51,168 --> 00:26:53,659
快点
Come on. Come on.

358
00:27:05,516 --> 00:27:08,178
雪莉， 快离开， 快
Mrs Palmer, get out of here. Go!

359
00:28:44,782 --> 00:28:45,874
杰克鲍尔
Jack Bauer.

360
00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:56,123
你今天给我很多麻烦了
You've caused me a lot of trouble today, Jack.

361
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:03,629
你不会交出修特， 对不对?
You're not gonna give me Hewitt, are you?

362
00:29:45,109 --> 00:29:48,044
轰炸机离目标只有三分钟
Our bombers are three minutes from the targets.

363
00:29:48,145 --> 00:29:52,479
开始探戈一号第六一程序
lnitiating sequence six one tango one.

364
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:55,641
目标出现， 武器锁定
Target in view. Weapons lock.

365
00:29:56,353 --> 00:29:59,288
要开始攻击吗?
Are we go for a strike?

366
00:29:59,356 --> 00:30:02,325
可以发射了吗?
Are we go for a launch?

367
00:30:03,861 --> 00:30:05,658
我们已经待命中
We are awaiting command.

368
00:30:05,729 --> 00:30:07,788
取消攻击
Abort the attack.

369
00:30:07,865 --> 00:30:11,028
取消， 取消
Abort, abort.

370
00:30:25,749 --> 00:30:29,014
什么意思?金斯利死了? 怎么会这样?
What do you mean, Kingsley's dead? How could that happen?

371
00:30:29,086 --> 00:30:31,520
我警告过你不要用他
I warned you not to use him.

372
00:30:31,588 --> 00:30:33,920
我们用了他， 但失败了
So we did use him and he failed.

373
00:30:34,024 --> 00:30:36,925
没关系 只要战争一开始就好了
But it won't matter. Once the war starts we'll be OK.

374
00:30:37,027 --> 00:30:41,054
-不会开始了 -为什么?
- It isn't going to start. - Why's that?

375
00:30:41,165 --> 00:30:43,111
总统已经知道录音的事
The president found out about the Cyprus

376
00:30:43,112 --> 00:30:44,863
取消攻击了
recording and called off the attack.

377
00:30:44,935 --> 00:30:47,927
不会开战了， 麦克斯
There isn't going to be any war, Max.

378
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:54,200
我们得用另一种方法来
Well, we're going to have to do this another way.

379
00:30:54,278 --> 00:30:56,938
-另一种方法，你在讲什么?
- Another way? What are you talking about?

380
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:58,079
-你会知道的
- You'll find out.

381
00:30:58,182 --> 00:31:00,173
今天就会开始
It'll start today.

382
00:31:08,859 --> 00:31:11,521
是我， 开始吧
It's me. Go ahead.

383
00:31:14,898 --> 00:31:17,366
内阁取消之前的决议
The cabinet has annulled its earlier action.

384
00:31:17,434 --> 00:31:19,511
我已经请特勤组
I have instructed the Secret Service

385
00:31:19,512 --> 00:31:21,531
恢复对您的服务
to resume its charge of serving you

386
00:31:21,605 --> 00:31:24,438
您现在是美国总统
as President of the United States.

387
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:26,774
我明白了
I see.

388
00:31:26,877 --> 00:31:31,280
我也已经提出辞呈 即刻生效
I've also tendered my resignation, effective immediately,

389
00:31:31,381 --> 00:31:34,490
所有投票反对您的内阁
and those members of the cabinet who voted

390
00:31:34,491 --> 00:31:37,378
也已经都同意辞职
against you have also agreed to resign.

391
00:31:39,923 --> 00:31:41,982
吉姆
Jim.

392
00:31:43,961 --> 00:31:45,952
各位先生， 女士...
Gentlemen, ladies...

393
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:51,498
今天我们几乎 要发动无谓的战争
we came dangerously close to war today.

394
00:31:53,003 --> 00:31:54,947
大家对核弹爆炸之事
That all of us reacted emotionally

395
00:31:54,948 --> 00:31:57,464
感到情绪化是可以理解的
to the nuclear detonation is understandable.

396
00:31:59,076 --> 00:32:01,081
但身为领袖
But leaders are required

397
00:32:01,082 --> 00:32:04,174
必须比常人更具耐心
to have patience beyond human limits.

398
00:32:06,283 --> 00:32:10,913
我们所要采取的行动
The kind of action we nearly took should only be exercised

399
00:32:10,988 --> 00:32:14,651
应该在所有证据查明后方可执行
after all other avenues have been exhausted.

400
00:32:16,193 --> 00:32:20,687
必须透过最严苛的求证
After the strictest standard of proof has been met.

401
00:32:22,266 --> 00:32:25,033
你们草率的隔离我
By casting me aside so quickly,

402
00:32:25,034 --> 00:32:28,604
只会降低求证的水准
you effectively lowered those standards.

403
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:31,300
这是很大的错误
And that was a profound mistake.

404
00:32:43,453 --> 00:32:48,186
但是我相信 以后绝不会再发生这种错误
It was not, however, a mistake you're likely to make again.

405
00:32:49,192 --> 00:32:52,719
所以我不接受你们的辞呈
Therefore I do not accept your resignations.

406
00:32:54,231 --> 00:32:56,893
我们今天要赶快安定国家
We have a nation to heal today.

407
00:32:59,169 --> 00:33:03,572
你们每一位都担负着 重要的任务
