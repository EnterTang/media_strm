1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:04,056
Yeah,there you go. That's
it. A little tighter.

2
00:00:04,686 --> 00:00:07,106
Now pull the loops as tight as you can.

3
00:00:08,766 --> 00:00:10,866
Ah,look at that.

4
00:00:10,936 --> 00:00:13,786
I mean,it's not bad for your first one.

5
00:00:14,546 --> 00:00:16,916
Green and red,like Luke
and Darth's lightsabers.

6
00:00:18,436 --> 00:00:20,816
Here is one for your collection.

7
00:00:21,256 --> 00:00:25,736
Your,uh,grandpa taught me how to
make these when I was your age.

8
00:00:27,906 --> 00:00:30,956
You're giving it to me? It's mine now?

9
00:00:40,036 --> 00:00:42,996
You weren't very good at this
when you were my age,were you?

10
00:00:44,896 --> 00:00:46,666
All right,smart guy.

11
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:51,446
Yeah,time to get dinner started.

12
00:01:01,956 --> 00:01:03,826
What is that?

13
00:01:06,796 --> 00:01:09,036
Probably an electrical storm.

14
00:01:12,106 --> 00:01:14,116
Put the fire out.

15
00:01:18,256 --> 00:01:20,086
Get in the tent!

16
00:01:23,536 --> 00:01:24,796
Dad!

17
00:01:32,946 --> 00:01:34,166
Owen?

18
00:01:37,256 --> 00:01:38,676
We'll be all right,kid.

19
00:01:52,566 --> 00:01:55,196
What kind of storm was that?

20
00:01:55,286 --> 00:01:56,786
It's a big one.

21
00:01:58,156 --> 00:02:00,056
The highway should be
just over that ridge,

22
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:02,686
and then we'll get a
ride to the nearest town.

23
00:02:02,686 --> 00:02:03,936
Dad?

24
00:02:04,136 --> 00:02:06,596
That's what you get for
camping in the Boonies,I guess.

25
00:02:06,636 --> 00:02:08,406
- Dad.
- What?

26
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:10,496
Look.

27
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,786
This is impossible.

28
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:19,786
We drove through here yesterday.

29
00:02:20,986 --> 00:02:23,146
There was nothing here.

30
00:02:23,756 --> 00:02:29,396
It's like... someone dropped
a town right on top of us.

31
00:02:40,956 --> 00:02:44,236
You need some help. You two look lost.

32
00:02:44,236 --> 00:02:45,876
Who are you?

33
00:02:46,436 --> 00:02:48,036
What is this place?

34
00:02:48,096 --> 00:02:51,186
Name's Graham. I'm the sheriff.

35
00:02:52,136 --> 00:02:54,076
Welcome to Storybrooke.

39
00:03:28,716 --> 00:03:30,526
I did it.

40
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:34,216
I won.

41
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:09,416
That should hold you.

42
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:15,686
I cannot believe you put
me on the early shift.

43
00:04:15,726 --> 00:04:18,516
Not my fault you stayed out all night.

44
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:22,806
When I put over easy on the menu,
I was talking about the eggs!

45
00:04:24,526 --> 00:04:25,966
Morning,madame mayor.

46
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:30,196
Good morning,Crick... Dr.Hopper.

47
00:04:30,196 --> 00:04:33,436
- Beautiful day,isn't it?
- Yes.

48
00:04:34,286 --> 00:04:36,426
Yes,it is.

49
00:04:37,966 --> 00:04:43,996
As we build our birdhouses, remember,what
you're making is a home,not a cage.

50
00:04:44,856 --> 00:04:47,936
A bird is free and will do what it will.

51
00:04:48,486 --> 00:04:50,976
This is for them,not us.

52
00:04:52,076 --> 00:04:54,496
They're loyal creatures.

53
00:04:59,576 --> 00:05:02,446
If you love them,and they love you,

54
00:05:02,446 --> 00:05:04,726
they will always find you.

55
00:05:07,496 --> 00:05:10,376
We'll pick this up
after recess. No running.

56
00:05:14,176 --> 00:05:15,916
Miss mills.

57
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:17,966
What are you doing here?

58
00:05:18,046 --> 00:05:19,996
Refresh my memory.

59
00:05:20,966 --> 00:05:23,736
How long have you been a teacher here?

60
00:05:24,756 --> 00:05:28,536
I... I'm not sure.

61
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,916
As long as I can remember.

62
00:05:31,266 --> 00:05:33,096
Come with me.

63
00:05:35,016 --> 00:05:36,786
Why are we in the hospital?

64
00:05:36,786 --> 00:05:40,506
Tell me. Do you know this man?

65
00:05:49,726 --> 00:05:53,706
No. Why? Who is he?

66
00:05:54,856 --> 00:05:59,966
He's a John Doe,a coma
patient. No one's claimed him.

67
00:06:00,086 --> 00:06:05,016
Maybe someday he'll wake up. Maybe
someone who loves him will find him.

68
00:06:06,386 --> 00:06:08,466
That would be nice for him.

69
00:06:09,306 --> 00:06:11,936
But I wouldn't count on it.

70
00:06:23,606 --> 00:06:25,206
Good morning,mayor.

71
00:06:27,516 --> 00:06:30,496
That uniform suits you nicely,sheriff.

72
00:06:30,636 --> 00:06:34,076
So... well-fitted.

73
00:06:36,276 --> 00:06:38,326
Want me to come over later?

74
00:06:40,726 --> 00:06:43,396
You like apple pancakes,too?

75
00:06:43,796 --> 00:06:48,156
Who are you? Whose child is this?

76
00:06:49,086 --> 00:06:52,896
- Is he yours?
- Mine? No.

77
00:06:52,896 --> 00:06:55,156
I was never so lucky.

78
00:06:55,226 --> 00:06:56,796
He's mine.

79
00:06:56,876 --> 00:07:00,896
And you'll have to excuse him. His manners
are a little rough around the edges.

80
00:07:01,326 --> 00:07:03,526
I'm,uh,Kurt Flynn.

81
00:07:07,976 --> 00:07:12,956
Sorry to interrupt your breakfast, but
we're,uh,looking to rent a hotel room for the night.

82
00:07:12,956 --> 00:07:14,626
Why would you need a hotel room?

83
00:07:14,676 --> 00:07:17,646
The same reason that
most people need one.

84
00:07:18,046 --> 00:07:20,546
We need a place to sleep.

85
00:07:23,006 --> 00:07:27,566
Would you excuse me
for a moment? Graham.

86
00:07:28,756 --> 00:07:30,696
I got a room for you.

87
00:07:33,466 --> 00:07:35,906
Who the hell are those people?

88
00:07:36,016 --> 00:07:37,976
Uh,I don't know.

89
00:07:38,086 --> 00:07:40,486
They just showed up.

90
00:07:40,536 --> 00:07:43,156
They were camping in the
woods near the toll bridge.

91
00:07:43,636 --> 00:07:45,726
I was just as surprised
to see them as you are.

92
00:07:45,726 --> 00:07:49,216
I don't like surprises,sheriff.
I find them threatening.

93
00:07:49,776 --> 00:07:54,796
And do you know what happens when
I feel threatened? Bad things.

94
00:07:55,486 --> 00:08:00,646
****

95
00:08:19,616 --> 00:08:22,136
Black always was your color.

96
00:08:22,516 --> 00:08:24,996
I'm here to bury my mother.

97
00:08:25,106 --> 00:08:30,236
- So if you've come to gloat...
- I came... to pay my respects.

98
00:08:33,016 --> 00:08:34,966
We had our differences,

99
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:38,136
but Cora will always
have a place in my heart.

100
00:08:40,986 --> 00:08:43,776
You killed her to save your own life.

101
00:08:43,816 --> 00:08:46,976
Sadly,desperate times call
for desperate measures.

102
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:51,406
Like getting Mary Margaret to
trick me into killing my own mother?

103
00:08:51,816 --> 00:08:56,176
You may be able to hide behind
your dagger,but she can't.

104
00:08:57,946 --> 00:09:00,446
She's going to die for what she did.

105
00:09:00,526 --> 00:09:02,426
Oh,come on.

106
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:09,666
We both know killing her will cost
you the thing you want most... Henry.

107
00:09:12,116 --> 00:09:15,336
Why don't you just give up
this obsession with vengeance?

108
00:09:15,426 --> 00:09:17,286
You know it can never make you happy.

109
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:18,776
Yes,it will.

110
00:09:18,856 --> 00:09:21,396
You had a whole curse
worth of vengeance,

111
00:09:21,446 --> 00:09:23,266
and what did it get you?

112
00:09:23,586 --> 00:09:26,146
A gaping hole in your heart.

113
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:29,836
- That was your curse.
- Which you cast.

114
00:09:30,176 --> 00:09:32,486
Still haven't learned
your lesson,have you?

115
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:33,646
What lesson?

116
00:09:33,716 --> 00:09:36,836
The same one your mother
learned a long time ago.

117
00:09:36,996 --> 00:09:39,406
You can't have everything.

118
00:09:40,326 --> 00:09:44,116
She wanted power,ripped
out her own heart to get it.

119
00:09:44,176 --> 00:09:45,846
You want vengeance?

120
00:09:45,956 --> 00:09:48,446
Henry's the price you'll pay.

121
00:09:50,406 --> 00:09:53,116
Time to cut your losses.

122
00:09:55,116 --> 00:09:57,196
Never.

123
00:09:57,586 --> 00:10:02,086
I will have my son,and
I will have my vengeance.

124
00:10:02,696 --> 00:10:06,846
I will find a way to have everything.

125
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:24,792
Anything?

126
00:10:24,872 --> 00:10:26,902
She won't eat a bite.

127
00:10:26,972 --> 00:10:28,892
What's wrong with her?

128
00:10:28,972 --> 00:10:32,512
Nothing. She's just a little... sick.

129
00:10:35,182 --> 00:10:39,142
- You guys are lying to me,aren't you?
- No one's lying.

130
00:10:39,142 --> 00:10:43,162
You are,just like you did about my dad.

131
00:10:43,222 --> 00:10:45,242
Henry,I...

132
00:10:47,952 --> 00:10:49,832
He's right. No more lying.

133
00:10:49,832 --> 00:10:53,072
- Emma...
- He deserves to know.

134
00:10:56,082 --> 00:11:00,002
Here's the thing,Henry. Cora's death...

135
00:11:00,002 --> 00:11:04,842
Mary Margaret was partially
responsible...for it,

136
00:11:04,842 --> 00:11:06,602
and that's why she's so upset.

137
00:11:06,602 --> 00:11:09,742
No. No,no,she couldn't.

138
00:11:09,812 --> 00:11:11,592
She was trying to protect us.

139
00:11:11,632 --> 00:11:15,042
But she's snow white.
She wouldn't hurt anybody.

140
00:11:18,042 --> 00:11:18,632
Get out.

141
00:11:18,632 --> 00:11:22,582
I think you're gonna wanna hear
what I have to say... for her sake.

142
00:11:22,662 --> 00:11:25,472
- What are you talking about?
- Regina.

143
00:11:25,472 --> 00:11:28,582
She's planning to strike
back against your mother.

144
00:11:28,582 --> 00:11:30,512
What is she gonna do to her?

145
00:11:30,572 --> 00:11:31,452
Oh,she didn't say.

146
00:11:31,452 --> 00:11:34,212
No. You don't get to come in here
and just drop a bomb like that.

147
00:11:34,212 --> 00:11:36,572
You're gonna figure this
out. And you're gonna help us.

148
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:38,002
And why should I?

149
00:11:38,092 --> 00:11:42,182
Because aside from us being family
now,Mary Margaret saved your life.

150
00:11:43,292 --> 00:11:45,372
Now you owe her a debt.

151
00:11:45,712 --> 00:11:47,862
And you always pay your debts,don't you?

152
00:11:47,912 --> 00:11:50,092
You're gonna help us stop Regina.

153
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,202
Thank you. It was really good.

154
00:11:58,222 --> 00:11:59,962
You're in my seat.

155
00:12:00,022 --> 00:12:02,192
- Sorry,miss...
- Mills.

156
00:12:02,192 --> 00:12:05,102
- Mills. Mayor Mills.

157
00:12:05,102 --> 00:12:06,712
I always sit in that seat.

158
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,832
But I'm already sitting here.

159
00:12:14,782 --> 00:12:17,582
I,uh,I just spoke with our mechanic.

160
00:12:17,662 --> 00:12:20,662
He assured me that your car will
be repaired by the end of the week.

161
00:12:20,702 --> 00:12:21,802
Really?

162
00:12:21,852 --> 00:12:25,682
He told me it would take at least
two weeks just to get the parts.

163
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:28,962
Well,things tend to get done
quickly when the mayor asks for them.

164
00:12:29,312 --> 00:12:32,452
And I'd hate to keep you
from getting home to...

165
00:12:33,392 --> 00:12:36,332
New Jersey. Home of the boss.

166
00:12:37,942 --> 00:12:42,072
Anyway,thank you,your
mayorness. Mayor. Whatever.

167
00:12:42,072 --> 00:12:44,062
We really appreciate it.

168
00:12:44,062 --> 00:12:45,512
Let's go.

169
00:13:01,962 --> 00:13:03,452
What's this?

170
00:13:03,522 --> 00:13:06,712
It's a gift for letting
me sit in your seat.

171
00:13:06,792 --> 00:13:08,612
For me?

172
00:14:03,572 --> 00:14:06,502
Maybe this time,you won't fall.

173
00:14:09,752 --> 00:14:13,722
This is the last time I'm
working the early shift.

174
00:14:17,092 --> 00:14:20,392
Good morning,madame mayor.
Beautiful day,isn't it?

175
00:14:24,272 --> 00:14:27,442
- Oh,madame mayor,I'm so sorry.
- You should be.

176
00:14:27,712 --> 00:14:30,132
Watch where you're going next time.

177
00:15:22,232 --> 00:15:23,972
Beautiful day.

178
00:15:24,182 --> 00:15:25,742
Save it.

179
00:15:29,532 --> 00:15:32,352
Mayor Mills,I am so sorry.

180
00:15:33,582 --> 00:15:36,272
I ran into you. Why are you apologizing?

181
00:15:36,272 --> 00:15:39,112
No,I should have been
looking where I was going.

182
00:15:39,712 --> 00:15:42,282
You're not even going to fight back?

183
00:15:42,402 --> 00:15:44,372
Fight back?

184
00:15:44,482 --> 00:15:46,762
Why would I do that?

185
00:15:54,812 --> 00:15:56,102
I'm not happy.

186
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:58,422
I believe Dr. Hopper's
office is down the street.

187
00:15:58,422 --> 00:16:00,772
Oh,I don't wanna talk to
him. I wanna talk to you.

188
00:16:00,772 --> 00:16:03,662
Very well,madame mayor. What
is it you wanna talk about?

189
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,922
This town.

190
00:16:06,142 --> 00:16:08,712
This isn't the deal we made.

191
00:16:10,112 --> 00:16:12,762
I'm sorry. I don't know
what you're talking about.

192
00:16:15,352 --> 00:16:17,852
You don't,do you?

193
00:16:19,142 --> 00:16:21,972
I was supposed to be happy here.

194
00:16:24,292 --> 00:16:26,462
Forgive me,but,um...

195
00:16:27,242 --> 00:16:29,092
You're the mayor.

196
00:16:29,182 --> 00:16:31,342
You're the most powerful
woman in the town.

197
00:16:31,402 --> 00:16:32,652
What is there to be unhappy about?

198
00:16:32,652 --> 00:16:35,242
Everyone in this town does
exactly what I want them to.

199
00:16:35,492 --> 00:16:37,182
And that's a problem?

200
00:16:37,212 --> 00:16:41,082
Well,they do it because they
have to, not because they want to.

201
00:16:42,672 --> 00:16:47,462
- It's not real.
- I'm sorry. What exactly is it you want?

202
00:16:48,412 --> 00:16:51,132
Nothing you can give me.

203
00:16:56,372 --> 00:17:00,172
Hello,Kurt? Mayor Mills.

204
00:17:00,492 --> 00:17:03,192
Good. You're still here.

205
00:17:03,362 --> 00:17:06,212
I would love to see
Owen before you leave.

206
00:17:06,872 --> 00:17:10,022
Would you two like to come
over for dinner tonight?

207
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,022
Great.

208
00:17:19,402 --> 00:17:21,292
****

209
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,702
Where... is it?

210
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:00,002
Thank you,mommy.

211
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:18,147
Well,it appears we just
missed our dear Queen.

212
00:18:18,267 --> 00:18:19,767
What is this?

213
00:18:22,857 --> 00:18:24,387
These are Cora's belongings.

214
00:18:24,427 --> 00:18:28,867
Looks like Regina's planning to use
one of her spells on Mary Margaret.

215
00:18:38,347 --> 00:18:40,337
Something's missing.

216
00:18:40,607 --> 00:18:43,227
Chimera blood. And viper's eye.

217
00:18:43,227 --> 00:18:45,837
What kind of curse
do you need those for?

218
00:18:46,407 --> 00:18:48,337
It's the curse of the empty-hearted.

219
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:49,957
What the hell does that do?

220
00:18:49,957 --> 00:18:52,517
In theory,it has the power
to make someone love you.

221
00:18:52,517 --> 00:18:55,357
Doesn't that break magic laws?

222
00:18:55,357 --> 00:18:58,397
You can't bring someone back to life.
You can't force someone to love you.

223
00:18:58,397 --> 00:19:01,817
Yeah,but this particular spell can
make someone think that they love you.

224
00:19:01,817 --> 00:19:05,637
And if you're as desperate for
love as Regina appears to be,

225
00:19:06,327 --> 00:19:08,327
you might just believe it.

226
00:19:08,427 --> 00:19:11,037
She's gonna use it on me,isn't she?

227
00:19:12,077 --> 00:19:14,947
Hey,buddy,why don't you go back
upstairs? Let us handle this.

228
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:15,957
No!

229
00:19:15,957 --> 00:19:18,897
Emma,you said you were
gonna be honest with me.

230
00:19:18,967 --> 00:19:22,017
Now why is Regina using this curse?

231
00:19:22,067 --> 00:19:24,967
Because it's the only way she
can get everything she wants,

232
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:26,977
that she can get you.

233
00:19:27,017 --> 00:19:28,407
But if all she wants is me...

234
00:19:28,407 --> 00:19:30,237
your mother is a complicated woman.

235
00:19:30,237 --> 00:19:34,817
She wants your love,of course, but she
also wants vengeance on Mary Margaret.

236
00:19:35,937 --> 00:19:37,647
How does the curse give her both?

237
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:40,917
Because the last ingredient
she needs to ignite the curse

238
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:43,437
is the heart of the
person she hates the most.

239
00:19:43,477 --> 00:19:45,017
You have to stop her.

240
00:19:45,077 --> 00:19:47,427
No,I don't have to do anything.

241
00:19:47,917 --> 00:19:49,587
On the contrary.

242
00:19:49,637 --> 00:19:51,787
I believe warning you fulfills my debt.

243
00:19:51,787 --> 00:19:54,647
Not even close. This is my
wife's life we're talking about.

244
00:19:54,647 --> 00:19:56,587
Not to mention your grandson's.

245
00:19:56,587 --> 00:19:59,237
Yeah,well,wars have costs.

246
00:19:59,327 --> 00:20:00,387
Nice.

247
00:20:00,387 --> 00:20:02,837
Well,this is a blood feud,dearie...

248
00:20:02,837 --> 00:20:05,187
one that goes back a
very,very long time.

249
00:20:05,257 --> 00:20:09,337
And the only way you could end a blood
feud is by the spilling of more blood.

250
00:20:09,567 --> 00:20:12,307
That is the only way I know to
eliminate your Regina problem.

251
00:20:12,347 --> 00:20:14,137
By what,killing her?

252
00:20:14,857 --> 00:20:16,857
Is there no other option?

253
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:18,317
I'm afraid not.

254
00:20:18,397 --> 00:20:21,937
Stop! Listen to yourselves.

255
00:20:21,937 --> 00:20:24,617
You're talking about killing my mom.

256
00:20:24,697 --> 00:20:27,977
You used to be heroes.
What happened to you?

257
00:20:31,307 --> 00:20:32,937
Henry.

258
00:20:35,617 --> 00:20:37,157
No matter how this plays out,

259
00:20:37,157 --> 00:20:39,917
we need to keep him as far
away from it as possible.

260
00:20:41,637 --> 00:20:43,157
She's right.

261
00:20:43,247 --> 00:20:46,147
Cora was dangerous because
she didn't have a heart.

262
00:20:46,187 --> 00:20:49,147
Regina's even more
dangerous because she does.

263
00:20:50,357 --> 00:20:53,717
This is,uh,really delicious
lasagna,isn't it,Owen?

264
00:20:53,967 --> 00:20:55,617
Not really.

265
00:20:56,517 --> 00:20:57,527
Owen.

266
00:20:57,557 --> 00:20:59,147
It's okay.

267
00:20:59,247 --> 00:21:01,747
I know I'm not the greatest cook...

268
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:04,637
unless it involves apples.

269
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:07,897
Speaking of which,

270
00:21:08,297 --> 00:21:12,057
how would you like to help
me make turnovers for dessert?

271
00:21:12,267 --> 00:21:15,177
There's a bunch of apples
sitting out in the sink.

272
00:21:15,257 --> 00:21:17,957
Why don't you go pick
out some good ones?

273
00:21:26,397 --> 00:21:30,897
Owen is a bit of a free
spirit. He gets it from his mom.

274
00:21:30,897 --> 00:21:35,477
Is she,uh... back in new
Jersey? With the boss?

275
00:21:35,477 --> 00:21:39,327
With the b... She,uh...

276
00:21:40,727 --> 00:21:43,227
She passed away six months ago.

277
00:21:43,257 --> 00:21:45,137
I'm sorry.

278
00:21:45,707 --> 00:21:48,007
That's why I brought him here,actually.

279
00:21:48,187 --> 00:21:52,477
Thought that camping,new
surroundings,maybe...

280
00:21:52,727 --> 00:21:55,667
that'd help him take his
mind off things,but...

281
00:21:59,057 --> 00:22:02,637
I came here looking to start over,too.

282
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:06,597
Hasn't turned out
quite the way I'd hoped.

283
00:22:06,647 --> 00:22:08,417
Why not?

284
00:22:09,137 --> 00:22:12,837
What good's a new life if you
don't have anyone to share it with?

285
00:22:13,097 --> 00:22:15,347
I thought we were making dessert!

286
00:22:23,507 --> 00:22:25,437
Voila.

287
00:22:25,747 --> 00:22:29,227
So... how come you're not a mom?

288
00:22:31,127 --> 00:22:33,707
Just didn't work out that way,I guess.

289
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:40,777
It's too bad.

290
00:22:41,457 --> 00:22:43,977
You'd be really good at it.

291
00:22:44,077 --> 00:22:46,407
Thank you,Owen.

292
00:22:47,207 --> 00:22:49,457
So how much longer?

293
00:22:51,057 --> 00:22:54,507
Patience. They're almost done.

294
00:22:56,127 --> 00:22:58,657
And how are you liking
Storybrooke so far?

295
00:22:58,697 --> 00:23:00,787
It's way better than New Jersey.

296
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:04,007
You don't miss your home? Your friends?

297
00:23:05,877 --> 00:23:07,737
I hate it there.

298
00:23:07,787 --> 00:23:10,697
All the kids at my
school treat me weird now.

299
00:23:10,887 --> 00:23:13,827
Because of what happened to your mother?

300
00:23:16,477 --> 00:23:18,247
Nobody gets it.

301
00:23:18,337 --> 00:23:22,077
- It's like...
- there's a piece of your heart missing.

302
00:23:26,377 --> 00:23:28,317
How's dessert coming?

303
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:30,927
Great.

304
00:23:31,007 --> 00:23:33,657
Owen and I were just talking,and...

305
00:23:35,027 --> 00:23:38,477
I know this might sound crazy,but...

306
00:23:39,327 --> 00:23:44,437
how would you two feel about
sticking around town a little longer?

307
00:23:45,797 --> 00:23:48,177
stick around? As in?

308
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:49,987
Move here.

309
00:23:50,427 --> 00:23:53,077
I can get you a job at the city,and...

310
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:55,457
there's a great school for Owen.

311
00:23:55,457 --> 00:23:57,717
Please,dad,can we?

312
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:01,927
It can be a chance for a new start.

313
00:24:04,177 --> 00:24:06,057
Well...

314
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:11,397
Look,I appreciate everything
you've done for us,

315
00:24:11,607 --> 00:24:14,797
but our life is in New Jersey.

316
00:24:15,297 --> 00:24:17,547
It's not here.

317
00:24:18,027 --> 00:24:20,087
Of course.

318
00:24:29,247 --> 00:24:31,597
Why did you bring me here?

319
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,327
I don't wanna talk to you.

320
00:24:34,677 --> 00:24:36,407
You don't have to.

321
00:24:36,407 --> 00:24:38,247
Hey,buddy. Saved you a seat.

322
00:24:38,247 --> 00:24:40,487
- I'm gonna get a coffee.
- Yeah.

323
00:24:41,727 --> 00:24:45,517
Here you go. One large
sundae. Extra everything.

324
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,437
Thanks,Ruby.

325
00:24:50,237 --> 00:24:54,297
- Extra everything?
- What?

326
00:24:54,297 --> 00:24:57,167
You think I don't know
a bribe when I see one?

327
00:25:00,137 --> 00:25:02,297
That obvious,huh?

328
00:25:02,657 --> 00:25:04,407
So what do you want?

329
00:25:04,457 --> 00:25:07,417
Well,your mom had told me
about what's been going on,

330
00:25:07,457 --> 00:25:11,097
and we thought that Storybrooke might
not be the safest place for you right now.

331
00:25:11,747 --> 00:25:14,887
So I was thinking... why
don't we go to New York?

332
00:25:14,887 --> 00:25:16,187
New York?

333
00:25:16,247 --> 00:25:19,627
Well,Regina can't cast that
curse if you're in New York.

334
00:25:19,627 --> 00:25:21,767
There's no magic there.

335
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:25,237
Someone should find a way
to get rid of magic here.

336
00:25:25,307 --> 00:25:27,687
My mom wouldn't be
able to cast the curse.

337
00:25:27,757 --> 00:25:31,307
My family wouldn't wanna kill
her. It... it'd solve everything.

338
00:25:32,847 --> 00:25:35,397
Yeah. You know what? You're right.

339
00:25:35,947 --> 00:25:38,627
But until then,why
don't you come with me?

340
00:25:42,087 --> 00:25:43,377
Thanks,Ruby.

341
00:25:43,377 --> 00:25:46,807
Excuse me. could I get this
sandwich wrapped up to go?

342
00:25:46,807 --> 00:25:49,257
I was thinking about going on a hike.

343
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:50,497
A hike,huh?

344
00:25:50,497 --> 00:25:53,657
Well,Dr. Whale said it'd be
good for me to get on my feet.

345
00:25:53,657 --> 00:25:58,557
And... plus I'm kind of
a... nature photography nerd.

346
00:25:58,887 --> 00:26:01,127
Just thought you'd be back
in Pennsylvania by now.

347
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:03,287
This town's starting to grow on me.

348
00:26:03,927 --> 00:26:06,077
Thank you very much.

349
00:26:15,587 --> 00:26:17,117
How did it go?

350
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,117
Went good. He said yes.

351
00:26:19,117 --> 00:26:20,387
Seriously?

352
00:26:20,387 --> 00:26:21,947
Yeah,he's in the bathroom right now.

353
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:24,177
I'm just... I'm gonna go home and pack.

354
00:26:24,177 --> 00:26:27,257
Not bad for day three as a
dad,if I do say so myself.

355
00:26:27,257 --> 00:26:29,497
Wait. Where's his backpack?

356
00:26:29,617 --> 00:26:31,357
Well,I don't know. He took it with him.

357
00:26:31,357 --> 00:26:34,947
To the bathroom? Did
you really fall for that?

358
00:26:34,947 --> 00:26:37,787
He's your son.

359
00:26:38,777 --> 00:26:40,667
He's running.

360
00:27:13,793 --> 00:27:15,533
Nice try,dearie.

361
00:27:15,623 --> 00:27:18,253
Did you really think it
was going to be that easy?

362
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:25,353
He can't be your guard dog forever.

363
00:27:32,953 --> 00:27:35,463
So what can I do to help,madame mayor?

364
00:27:35,513 --> 00:27:37,223
Kurt Flynn's car.

365
00:27:37,293 --> 00:27:39,003
Yeah,the one you asked me to fix ASAP.

366
00:27:39,003 --> 00:27:41,813
Yes. Plans have changed.

367
00:27:41,813 --> 00:27:45,383
I now need Mr. Flynn and his
son to stay a while longer.

368
00:27:45,653 --> 00:27:49,223
Perhaps you can take a couple
extra days with the repairs?

369
00:27:49,273 --> 00:27:51,843
I'm afraid that Mr. Flynn
already picked the car up.

370
00:27:51,843 --> 00:27:55,163
What? When?

371
00:27:55,323 --> 00:27:57,483
Ten minutes ago.

372
00:28:04,603 --> 00:28:08,483
Sheriff... our visitors are
driving out of Storybrooke.

373
00:28:08,483 --> 00:28:11,253
Find them before they
cross the town line,

374
00:28:11,253 --> 00:28:15,213
pull the car over and arrest
the father for drunk driving,

375
00:28:15,213 --> 00:28:17,603
then bring the boy to me.

376
00:28:22,073 --> 00:28:25,023
- Kurt.
- Yeah?

377
00:28:25,713 --> 00:28:28,033
That wasn't what it sounded like.

378
00:28:28,293 --> 00:28:30,203
Don't want any trouble.

379
00:28:30,303 --> 00:28:32,773
Just came by to say thank you and...

380
00:28:32,773 --> 00:28:36,493
Wait. It was just a misunderstanding.

381
00:28:36,493 --> 00:28:39,943
No. I understood. We're leaving.

382
00:28:39,943 --> 00:28:42,443
I'm not going to hurt
him. Please don't leave.

383
00:28:42,443 --> 00:28:43,593
Whoa,mate.

384
00:28:43,983 --> 00:28:45,823
What are you doing?

385
00:28:47,243 --> 00:28:49,123
I'm afraid you're under arrest
for driving under the influence.

386
00:28:49,123 --> 00:28:50,753
What? Drunk?

387
00:28:50,753 --> 00:28:53,993
I'm not drunk,and I sure as
hell haven't been driving.

388
00:28:53,993 --> 00:28:56,383
Don't make this harder on yourself.

389
00:28:56,623 --> 00:28:58,483
What did you do to him?

390
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:00,093
She's controlling you.

391
00:29:00,093 --> 00:29:03,143
I don't know how,but she
had this glowing thing.

392
00:29:03,143 --> 00:29:06,043
It was shaped like a
heart. Don't listen to her.

393
00:29:06,043 --> 00:29:08,453
And you say you haven't been drinking?

394
00:29:19,363 --> 00:29:20,953
What was that?

395
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:28,643
- Dad,what's wrong?
- We need... we gotta get outta here.

396
00:29:39,693 --> 00:29:42,633
- Hey,kid. You all right?
- Yeah.

397
00:29:42,633 --> 00:29:44,973
What are you doing out
here all by yourself,huh?

398
00:29:44,973 --> 00:29:48,393
Boy scout. Trying to get a merit badge.

399
00:29:50,723 --> 00:29:52,633
Well,what are you doing out here?

400
00:29:52,653 --> 00:29:54,273
I'm hiking.

401
00:29:54,353 --> 00:29:58,063
And I'm... I'm taking pictures
of Maine's scenic beauty.

402
00:29:59,273 --> 00:30:01,133
The hiking trail's that way.

403
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:02,553
Okay.

404
00:30:03,233 --> 00:30:04,473
Thanks.

405
00:30:07,903 --> 00:30:11,223
Is it... Henry?

406
00:30:12,983 --> 00:30:16,053
Well... good luck with your merit badge.

407
00:30:21,643 --> 00:30:23,303
- Henry!
- Henry!

408
00:30:23,303 --> 00:30:25,003
Oh,down here.

409
00:30:27,753 --> 00:30:28,853
He was in here.

410
00:30:28,853 --> 00:30:31,193
Why would an 11-year-old
kid run away to the mines?

411
00:30:31,193 --> 00:30:33,383
Wouldn't be the first time.

412
00:30:33,463 --> 00:30:36,313
I think I know what he was looking for.

413
00:30:36,823 --> 00:30:38,873
The dynamite the dwarves
used for blasting.

414
00:30:38,873 --> 00:30:41,293
What the hell would
he want dynamite for?

415
00:30:41,823 --> 00:30:44,153
To get rid of magic.

416
00:30:44,263 --> 00:30:45,213
Wait. What?

417
00:30:45,213 --> 00:30:47,253
At the diner,he said someone
should get rid of magic.

418
00:30:47,253 --> 00:30:49,883
So he's gonna... blow it up?

419
00:30:49,883 --> 00:30:52,043
Where would he even go to do that?

420
00:31:11,811 --> 00:31:14,061
- Hello?
- Is this Henry's mother?

421
00:31:14,061 --> 00:31:15,251
Who's asking?

422
00:31:15,251 --> 00:31:17,231
- My name's Greg Mendell.
- Who?

423
00:31:17,231 --> 00:31:19,641
The guy that crashed
his car outside of town.

424
00:31:19,641 --> 00:31:22,221
See,I... I was out here
hiking in the woods,and...

425
00:31:22,221 --> 00:31:24,761
he was by the White Pine Trail,

426
00:31:24,761 --> 00:31:26,621
and he was all by himself.

427
00:31:26,621 --> 00:31:28,981
Well,what's he doing
out there? Is he okay?

428
00:31:28,981 --> 00:31:32,351
I... I don't know. He ran off,but
he... he seemed a little upset,

429
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:35,871
and I...I just thought that you
would want to know. That's... all.

430
00:31:35,871 --> 00:31:37,581
I'm on my way.

431
00:31:44,011 --> 00:31:46,501
What's going on,dad? What do they want?

432
00:31:51,051 --> 00:31:52,881
We're gonna get outta here.

433
00:31:55,591 --> 00:31:56,891
Come on!

434
00:31:56,891 --> 00:31:58,331
Dad!

435
00:32:02,841 --> 00:32:05,111
- Look out!
- Dad!

436
00:32:11,341 --> 00:32:13,341
Faster,dad!

437
00:32:32,111 --> 00:32:33,851
I think we lost 'em.

438
00:32:35,591 --> 00:32:36,991
Dad!

439
00:32:45,341 --> 00:32:47,881
All right,listen to me.

440
00:32:48,121 --> 00:32:50,631
Run into the woods. Get as
far away from here as you can.

441
00:32:50,631 --> 00:32:52,471
You call your uncle.

442
00:32:52,581 --> 00:32:55,311
- Go.
- No. Not without you.

443
00:32:59,121 --> 00:33:00,891
There's a reason I gave you that.

444
00:33:00,971 --> 00:33:04,561
Because as long as you have
it,I'll always be with you.

445
00:33:05,131 --> 00:33:08,031
You can do this. So do it.

446
00:33:08,841 --> 00:33:12,861
Run! Go! Go!

447
00:33:13,411 --> 00:33:15,091
Run!

448
00:33:18,811 --> 00:33:22,571
You might have this whole town wrapped
around your finger,but not my son!

449
00:33:23,111 --> 00:33:25,821
You can't force him to stay with you!

450
00:33:28,651 --> 00:33:31,451
- Dad!
- Don't stop!

451
00:33:31,451 --> 00:33:34,571
Run! Run!

452
00:33:34,571 --> 00:33:37,891
Owen? It's okay. I'm
not going to hurt you.

453
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:40,481
Why are you doing this?

454
00:33:41,171 --> 00:33:43,941
I just want you to stay with me.

455
00:33:45,951 --> 00:33:48,591
You said you liked it here.

456
00:33:48,711 --> 00:33:51,731
You wanna stay here,don't you?

457
00:33:52,791 --> 00:33:55,441
Not like this.

458
00:33:58,751 --> 00:34:01,261
I'm sorry.

459
00:34:02,191 --> 00:34:05,121
I just wanted us to be happy.

460
00:34:09,061 --> 00:34:11,141
Run,Owen!

461
00:34:30,911 --> 00:34:33,051
Henry?

462
00:34:37,411 --> 00:34:39,521
What are you doing?

463
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:41,211
I'm getting rid of magic.

464
00:34:41,211 --> 00:34:44,031
I... it's ruining
everything,and you can't stop me.

465
00:34:44,031 --> 00:34:46,881
All that's gonna do is get you killed.

466
00:34:47,581 --> 00:34:49,961
You just say that
because you need magic.

467
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:52,741
So you can cast that curse on me.

468
00:35:00,551 --> 00:35:03,011
I can't lose you,Henry.

469
00:35:03,391 --> 00:35:05,271
You mean too much to me.

470
00:35:05,341 --> 00:35:07,641
Then don't cast the curse.

471
00:35:07,821 --> 00:35:09,881
Don't kill Mary Margaret.

472
00:35:09,951 --> 00:35:12,081
Henry,she has to pay.

473
00:35:12,161 --> 00:35:15,351
The curse... it won't
make me love you for real.

474
00:35:15,351 --> 00:35:17,081
It'll be fake.

475
00:35:17,161 --> 00:35:19,581
But it will be something.

476
00:35:19,911 --> 00:35:24,031
I know it's hard for you to
understand right now,but you'll see.

477
00:35:24,351 --> 00:35:26,491
We can be happy.

478
00:35:26,531 --> 00:35:30,141
We can have everything.

479
00:35:31,121 --> 00:35:33,631
Not like this.

480
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:36,971
Hey,Regina! Get away from my son!

481
00:35:37,961 --> 00:35:40,381
He's not yours. He's mine.

482
00:35:40,461 --> 00:35:43,661
And after I cast this,you'll
never see him again.

483
00:35:43,661 --> 00:35:44,991
That's never gonna happen.

484
00:35:44,991 --> 00:35:47,671
You wanna kill Mary Margaret,you're
gonna have to go through us.

485
00:35:48,411 --> 00:35:50,271
Okay.

486
00:35:52,001 --> 00:35:53,621
- Stop!
- Henry,get out of the way!

487
00:35:53,621 --> 00:35:57,311
Not until someone
helps me destroy magic!

488
00:35:57,311 --> 00:36:00,141
There's no way to get rid of
it. You can't just blow it up.

489
00:36:00,141 --> 00:36:02,701
Magic isn't the problem,kid. It's her.

490
00:36:02,701 --> 00:36:06,311
It's not just her. It's everyone.

491
00:36:06,311 --> 00:36:09,341
Look what magic did to Mary Margaret.

492
00:36:10,721 --> 00:36:13,431
Look at what it did to you.

493
00:36:13,581 --> 00:36:15,851
It's ruining everything.

494
00:36:17,451 --> 00:36:22,171
- It makes good people do terrible things.
- And bad people.

495
00:36:27,621 --> 00:36:29,211
Please.

496
00:36:29,211 --> 00:36:33,541
It's gonna destroy my
family. Help me get rid of it.

497
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:37,931
I can't do that,Henry.

498
00:36:39,961 --> 00:36:43,331
But there is something I can do.

499
00:36:56,311 --> 00:36:58,191
Thank you.

500
00:37:28,752 --> 00:37:31,652
Here. This is where they took my dad.

501
00:37:31,652 --> 00:37:33,672
There's nothing here,kid.

502
00:37:34,242 --> 00:37:38,662
No. No. This is where
Storybrooke was,behind this rock.

503
00:37:38,662 --> 00:37:42,592
Son,there isn't a town called
Storybrooke anywhere in Maine.

504
00:37:42,592 --> 00:37:45,122
So you don't believe me?

505
00:37:47,722 --> 00:37:52,192
Look. Now you've been through a lot.

506
00:37:53,742 --> 00:37:55,072
Son!

507
00:37:59,502 --> 00:38:04,552
I'll find you,dad! I promise!
I'll never stop looking!

508
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:20,092
Come on,son. Come on,let's go.

509
00:38:21,202 --> 00:38:23,342
It's okay.

510
00:38:39,422 --> 00:38:41,782
Okay.

511
00:38:44,732 --> 00:38:46,832
That was your husband.

512
00:38:47,882 --> 00:38:51,762
It's seems that Henry convinced
Regina to destroy the curse,

513
00:38:52,092 --> 00:38:55,112
which means my services
are no longer required.

514
00:38:57,142 --> 00:38:59,342
How do you do it?

515
00:38:59,542 --> 00:39:01,482
Do what?

516
00:39:02,552 --> 00:39:07,532
Live with yourself,knowing
all the bad things you've done.

517
00:39:08,422 --> 00:39:11,692
Well,you tell yourself
you did the right thing.

518
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:15,012
And if you say it often enough,

519
00:39:15,432 --> 00:39:18,392
one day you might actually believe it.

520
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:40,292
You.

521
00:39:43,022 --> 00:39:45,082
Kill me.

522
00:39:46,492 --> 00:39:48,172
What?

523
00:39:49,062 --> 00:39:52,222
Regina,we have been
fighting for so long.

524
00:39:52,482 --> 00:39:54,402
It's cost us so much.

525
00:39:54,472 --> 00:39:57,542
It has to end before anyone else dies.

526
00:39:57,782 --> 00:40:02,092
So... Please...

527
00:40:02,552 --> 00:40:04,502
Just do it.

528
00:40:08,022 --> 00:40:10,932
Henry would never forgive me.

529
00:40:11,802 --> 00:40:14,962
But do you know what my problem is?

530
00:40:15,492 --> 00:40:18,412
I never learn from my mistakes.

531
00:40:34,152 --> 00:40:36,182
What?

532
00:40:39,142 --> 00:40:42,152
- Do you see that?
- What did you do to it?

533
00:40:42,152 --> 00:40:47,042
Oh,I didn't do that. You did it.

534
00:40:48,922 --> 00:40:50,782
You darkened yourself.

535
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:53,232
No. No. No!

536
00:40:53,232 --> 00:40:56,052
Yes. And once you blacken your heart,

537
00:40:56,052 --> 00:41:01,122
it only grows darker and darker.

538
00:41:02,622 --> 00:41:03,772
Trust me. I know.

539
00:41:03,772 --> 00:41:08,252
So crush it. Do it. Crush
it. Get it over with.

540
00:41:08,252 --> 00:41:11,352
And put you out of your misery?

541
00:41:12,912 --> 00:41:17,822
I don't need to destroy you.
Your doing it to yourself.

542
00:41:18,682 --> 00:41:20,232
And along the way,

543
00:41:20,302 --> 00:41:26,052
you'll bring down that perfect little
family you fought so hard to reunite.

544
00:41:31,012 --> 00:41:34,332
And then Henry will be mine.

545
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:37,172
Please kill me.

546
00:41:40,202 --> 00:41:45,192
- Please,just kill me.
- You see,I can have everything.

547
00:41:50,532 --> 00:41:53,152
Thanks to you.

548
00:41:55,042 --> 00:41:58,932
Now get off my porch.

549
00:42:22,742 --> 00:42:26,712
I'll find you,dad. I promise.
