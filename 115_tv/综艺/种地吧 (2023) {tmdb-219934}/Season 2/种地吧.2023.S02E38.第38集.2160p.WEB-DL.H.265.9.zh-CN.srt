1
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,040
What is it about?

2
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,760
The Northern Desert is scared

3
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,839
Send some treasure to me

4
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,959
Beg for peace

5
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:00,559
My chief extends greetings to

6
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,879
Ashile Tegin

7
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,080
Is this from Pu Sa?

8
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:03,639
Yes

9
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,080
The Northern Desert is reckless and ignorant,

10
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:05,959
and makes public anger

11
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,720
My chief feels very regretful,

12
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,479
and begs for Ashile Tribe's pardon

13
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,039
So with this,

14
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,639
my chief hopes two Tegins

15
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,160
would say something favorable

16
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,800
for the King of the Northern Desert

17
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,000
We'll provide a big present 

18
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,880
after my chief is pardoned

19
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,320
OK

20
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,440
This is very precious

21
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,479
Tegin Sun should cherish it

22
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,039
Let me have a look

23
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:35,479
What is it?

24
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,199
Don't worry

25
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,000
My chief

26
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,600
would be equitable to both of you

27
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,240
Why is my gift so small?

28
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,199
This one is better

29
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,440
It's so big

30
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,119
I've never

31
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:50,800
seen one so big

32
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,039
You keep your small stone

33
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:52,800
Damn it!

34
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,880
Take the treasure

35
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:54,880
to my tent

36
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:55,559
OK

37
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:56,119
I'll divide it up to all of you

38
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,559
I'm the fairest

39
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:00,320
Let's go

40
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,360
She's made so much effort

41
00:03:34,679 --> 00:03:35,960
just for a private meeting?

42
00:03:36,839 --> 00:03:37,759
She would have something very important

43
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,639
I'll meet her tonight

44
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,000
You stay here 

45
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,479
What do you mean?
干什么

46
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,199
You just write back like this?

47
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,279
Isn't it OK?
不行吗

48
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,320
She is dating with you

49
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,360
Sun

50
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:03,759
Have you heard a sentence

51
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,520
which is "transfer love by a flying letter  "

52
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,960
We are together in minds

53
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,119
We don't need it

54
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:10,360
Yes,you are right

55
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,839
But you can write more in your letter

56
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,479
So tell me what I should write in the letter?

57
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,040
No way

58
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,720
Should I teach you how to do that?

59
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,079
Just write down

60
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:21,480
what you want to say to her

61
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,600
OK,I won't see

62
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,239
Just write down what you want to say to her

63
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,959
Don't peek

64
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,200
OK,OK

65
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,160
Just write

66
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,119
I won't peek

67
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,559
You do it so fast

68
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,119
Why don't you write more?

69
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,640
There is no need

70
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:16,480
Don't read it

71
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,880
OK,I get it

72
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:27,760
Ashile Tegin said

73
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,200
he will meet you on time

74
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,000
So what is it?

75
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:31,920
I've no idea

76
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,720
He told me to give it to you

77
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,640
Thank you

78
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,559
Chief

79
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,720
Did you check the box?

80
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,000
What's hidden in it?

81
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,880
I'm surprised that

82
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,160
the well-renowned Ashile Sun

83
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:09,239
is so sentimental

84
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,239
Mr. Qin had told me that

85
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,959
you decided to stay in the Northern Desert

86
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:56,600
If it weren't for saving my people,

87
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,160
I would take you back

88
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:00,119
as quickly as possible

89
00:08:10,119 --> 00:08:10,839
What's wrong?

90
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,239
Do you paint face powder?

91
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,760
Zhen Zhu uses it

92
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,839
Maybe I touched it accidentally

93
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:22,920
Does it smell good?

94
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,839
I think

95
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,440
this girl's taste is mediocre

96
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,279
I'll tell her not to paint it anymore

97
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,760
Let's get to the point

98
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,960
Why does the Eagle Division come here?

99
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:36,960
That is military order

100
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,479
Let soldiers just recovering from plague fight
让大病初愈的人上战场

101
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,559
It looks like the capital

102
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:41,320
wants to

103
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,679
destroy the Eagle Division's troops

104
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,359
Changge

105
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,039
You know I don't want to

106
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,320
assume the worst condition

107
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,320
But this is the fact

108
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,479
If you want me to

109
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,400
betray the Ashile Tribe

110
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:55,239
and Great Khan,

111
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,719
I can't do that

112
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,400
He had fostered me,

113
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,000
and given me a new life

114
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:03,559
I can't

115
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:04,520
betray him

116
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:06,000
So

117
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:07,359
What about the Eagle Division?

118
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:09,840
I have no choice

119
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,559
Yes,you do

120
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,799
I come to you tonight

121
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,239
and want to tell you that

122
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,400
except betrayal and neutrality,

123
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,039
you have another way

124
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:22,880
Has he agreed?

125
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,520
He'll reply in two days

126
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,200
I am warning you 

127
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,520
If I don't get

128
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,799
what I want

129
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,840
in two days,

130
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,000
I wouldn't let you

131
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,200
see the third day's sunrise

132
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,159
Sun

133
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,119
The Bear Division

134
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,679
needs to talk with us
说有要事要商议

135
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:55,119
Let's go

136
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,440
Why does your face look so bad?

137
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:05,119
Didn't you sleep last night?

138
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,000
Let me in

139
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,760
I want to meet Sun Tegin

140
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,479
Let me in

141
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:11,080
Mimi

142
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:12,640
Let her go

143
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:18,919
You can't stay with the Bear Division,

144
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,400
or you'll die

145
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:36,719
Sun

146
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,119
I 've checked that

147
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,760
Mimi is right

148
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,320
The Bear Division's arrows and slings

149
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:44,640
should aim at the direction of the Desert

150
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,400
But now their angles are adjusted lower

151
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:47,280
There couldn't

152
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,200
appear so much error

153
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:50,520
It's obvious that they target us

154
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,919
Say something

155
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,359
now

156
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,719
Let me think over it

157
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:58,239
Why are you so hesitant?

158
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,359
Tu Kashe was not so bold

159
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,799
before

160
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,359
He is supported by someone in secret now

161
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:02,960
Shut up

162
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:08,080
Even if we defeat him this time
就算这一次打赢了

163
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:09,760
we live,

164
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,479
and he spares us

165
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,479
What about next time?

166
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,440
What about the third time?

167
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,440
They wouldn't stop

168
00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:24,840
unless the Eagle Division is destroyed

169
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,880
You go out

170
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,520
Let me stay alone

171
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,440
Let's go,Mimi

172
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,119
Mimi,I have a question to ask you

173
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:38,359
I know what you want to say

174
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,919
I have something to tell you

175
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,000
I know these plans,

176
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,840
because I'm a mole

177
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,039
sent by the capital

178
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:01,320
And then?

179
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,479
And

180
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:05,320
the boy who had infected

181
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:07,200
the Eagle Division with plague,

182
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,200
looked like

183
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,919
my younger brother Bu Zhen so much

184
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:12,479
She knew I would save him

185
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:13,320
So...

186
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:14,640
You have a younger brother?

187
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,520
They'd caught him

188
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,520
as hostage

189
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:24,520
They even force me to set fire on comfreys,

190
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,520
or they'll kill him

191
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,919
You've saved the Eagle Division

192
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,400
You are the savior of the Eagle Division

193
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:40,200
I promise you

194
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,039
I'll do my best

195
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,520
to save your younger brother out

196
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:48,479
I don't even know

197
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,080
whether he is still alive or not

198
00:12:56,119 --> 00:12:57,479
No matter what happens to him,

199
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,440
I'll give you an answer

200
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,039
Sun and I are gonna

201
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,200
meet Tu Kashe first

202
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,159
Don't think about too much

203
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:09,840
You are the family of the Eagle Division forever
你永远都是鹰师的家人

204
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:12,000
You are my Mimi
是我的弥弥

205
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:22,960
Mu Jin

206
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:24,760
Let's go

207
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,359
So I'll go first

208
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,799
Here you come

209
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,119
Is that all food?

210
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,440
Maybe it only satisfies three days for the army

211
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,719
Are three days not long enough

212
00:13:52,719 --> 00:13:54,000
to deal with those rats?

213
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,840
What do you think about submission and

214
00:13:56,719 --> 00:13:57,400
presenting treasure of the Northern Desert

215
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,919
We take treasure

216
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:00,679
The war still goes on

217
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,799
You keep your words

218
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:04,239
so much

219
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,080
I'll start an attack tomorrow,

220
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,559
and command my 10,000 troops to annihilate

221
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,280
5000 cavalries of the Northern Desert

222
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,640
And with favorable victorious condition,

223
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,640
we'll take down the city of the Northern Desert

224
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:19,679
How do you think about the plan?

225
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:23,080
This is good,

226
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,919
But not good enough

227
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,719
So what better plans do you have?

228
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:29,640
You'll attack next day

229
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:30,840
This means you would give enemies

230
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,080
the whole night to prepare for battle

231
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,440
The enemies have one-night to strengthen

232
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:36,039
Then the battle of tomorrow

233
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,239
will be uncertian for victory

234
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:41,200
You mean...

235
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:42,599
Prepare for battle tomorrow

236
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,280
as scheduled

237
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,679
But the time we start the attack

238
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:47,039
is tonight

239
00:14:47,479 --> 00:14:48,359
Surprise attack ?

240
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,320
We should raid the enemies

241
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:51,840
during its lax

242
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:53,960
and defencelessness

243
00:14:55,599 --> 00:14:56,200
So we'll act

244
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,479
with your plan

245
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:10,799
Khan Junior

246
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:12,239
Get aside

247
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,320
I want to see the Great Khan

248
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:15,440
I'm sorry

249
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:17,840
The Great Khan is convalescing

250
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,599
He has ordered 

251
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:19,719
nobody can't disturb him

252
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,919
I'm here to ask about khan's sickness

253
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:21,400
OK?

254
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,239
Please,don't give me a hard time

255
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,440
She'er

256
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,479
Mother

257
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:36,239
Wait

258
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,520
Mother

259
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,080
Khan doesn't allow me to meet him privately

260
00:15:45,719 --> 00:15:47,520
This order has been cancelled

261
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,520
What?

262
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,119
When?

263
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,599
Why does nobody tell me?

264
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,159
The Great Khan has told me

265
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,799
just now

266
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:01,400
What's wrong?

267
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:02,840
Nothing

268
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:03,799
I...

269
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,599
I just don't get used to it

270
00:16:05,719 --> 00:16:06,640
all of a sudden

271
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:09,080
You will

272
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,440
You are my son

273
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:12,919
We 

274
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,640
shouldn't be separated

275
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,960
But why does the Great Khan

276
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,760
agree suddenly?

277
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,719
Maybe

278
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,520
he is sick so badly,and

279
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,559
has realized the importance of relationship

280
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,359
I haven't see him in a long time

281
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:29,000
So I'd better see him

282
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,039
In addition

283
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,919
I have something to ask the Great Khan

284
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,840
He just took medicine

285
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:34,719
and slept

286
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:36,280
You could tell me

287
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:38,599
what you want to say to Khan

288
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,840
Tell me,what do you want to ask?

289
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:50,280
Khan has sent the Eagle Division and

290
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,000
the Bear Division to suppress the Northern Desert
鹰师和熊师出征漠北

291
00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:53,200
What about the Wolf Division?

292
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,080
So what do you think about it?

293
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,719
This opportunity to make honour should

294
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,080
belong to the Wolf Division

295
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,239
In the Battle of Weishui

296
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:00,960
The Wolf Division made no achievement

297
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:02,919
It was ashamed 

298
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:04,079
in front of all tribes

299
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,920
Now the Wolf Division needs a battle

300
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,040
to prove itself urgently

301
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,800
I come here

302
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,359
to ask Khan to let me fight

303
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,839
I'll take down the Northern Desert

304
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,760
for my Khan

305
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,079
She'er,do you remember

306
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,079
what I told you when you were young?

307
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,800
No small tolerance would ruin big strategy

308
00:17:23,479 --> 00:17:24,479
What you should do right now

309
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,119
is to reserve your strength

310
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:28,160
As long as you are powerful enough,

311
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,760
and hold on to last minute,

312
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,839
the opportunity would come to you

313
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,680
The Great Khan sent me to the border

314
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:36,599
to inspect the military

315
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,000
But when I came back

316
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:38,920
We are gonna move capital,

317
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:40,400
but suppress the Desert at the same time

318
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:41,880
I think all of them

319
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,959
lack of consideration

320
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:44,839
It's not like the Great Khan's order

321
00:17:47,439 --> 00:17:49,359
I want to show you something

322
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:03,839
The seal...

323
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,920
The great Khan is in critical condition

324
00:18:07,439 --> 00:18:08,760
He has transfered the seal

325
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,319
to me

326
00:18:11,439 --> 00:18:12,640
From now on

327
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:14,079
I'll be in charge of

328
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:16,479
the whole capital

329
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,239
So..

330
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,319
Do you think I

331
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,119
have no ability to take charge?

332
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,239
No

333
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,160
I  just...

334
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,280
She'er

335
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,680
You should be happy for me

336
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,520
In future,

337
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,599
I won't submit to scary and humiliation

338
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,760
You can come to me if you want to

339
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,920
You can go anywhere if you want to

340
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:41,439
Isn't it good?

341
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,760
The Great Khan is sick seriously

342
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:52,239
He can't deal with affairs anymore

343
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:53,880
From now on

344
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:57,040
Maybe the seal,

345
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,599
the capital,

346
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,599
and the whole grassland

347
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,920
will be yours

348
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:07,560
You must get prepared for it

349
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,800
OK,go back to rest

350
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:16,880
Don't think too much

351
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:58,359
Is everything ready?

352
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:02,680
Yes,Tegin Sun

353
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,000
Tonight relies on

354
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,839
the Eagle Division's

355
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,359
performance

356
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,800
We'll assist you

357
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,719
I'll lead the Eagle Division to charge from the north

358
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,319
The Bear Division charges from the south

359
00:20:13,239 --> 00:20:14,400
We'll launch attacks from two directions

360
00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:15,959
Great

361
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,439
Great

362
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,119
Attention,the Eagle Division

363
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,000
Yes,sir

364
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:24,040
Charge with me

365
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:24,959
Yes,sir

366
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,079
Would Tu Kashe fall into this trap?

367
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,040
Can we succeed?

368
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,160
Don't worry

369
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:58,719
Everything is under plan

370
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,719
The sun is going to set soon

371
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,599
Do you think

372
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,000
you could see the sun of next day?

373
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,719
The sunset is beautiful

374
00:21:07,439 --> 00:21:08,119
Chief has no need to say such words

375
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,640
ruining this pleasant atmosphere

376
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,719
Report

377
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,680
Chief,the envoy from the Eagle Division comes here

378
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:14,719
Bring him in

379
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,319
Yes,sir

380
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:21,920
Mimi

381
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,079
Changge

382
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:24,839
Mimi

383
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,280
Why are you here as a messager?

384
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,680
It's a long story

385
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:29,160
I met with Tegin Sun just now

386
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,719
He wants you to take a message

387
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,599
to two chiefs

388
00:21:35,199 --> 00:21:36,640
Just tell me

389
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,599
Help the Eagle Division make a fake defeat

390
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,160
He'll help the Northern Desert

391
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,040
make a big victory

392
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:46,040
What are you waiting for?

393
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:47,160
Get that Chief Yi Nan

394
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:47,640
up here now

395
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,119
Do you want me to call him by myself?

396
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,599
Tegin

397
00:21:54,199 --> 00:21:55,439
When would we attack?

398
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:57,959
Just wait

399
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:00,880
The more they lose,

400
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,880
the easier

401
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,479
we get rid of them

402
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:21,359
Bear Division

403
00:22:21,719 --> 00:22:22,319
Yes,sir

404
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:25,239
Follow me

405
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:25,719
Charge

406
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:27,359
Charge

407
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,800
Stop

408
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:35,760
Where is the Eagle Division?

409
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,040
Where is it?

410
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,119
Ambush!

411
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,599
We get ambushed

412
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:47,599
Why the enemies are here?

413
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:49,800
Damn it,we get trapped

414
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:52,680
Get back

415
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,760
Retreat

416
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:56,439
Report

417
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:00,400
Come on in

418
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,640
What's the status in the front line?

419
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,520
Ashile's Bear Division

420
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,439
had been taken to ambush circle

421
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,520
The two chiefs

422
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,719
led their armies to attack from two directions

423
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:09,560
The Bear Division couldn't stand

424
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,359
What about the Eagle Division?

425
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,359
It just made bluff

426
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,680
in battlefield

427
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,119
Then its army moved out of the battlefield

428
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,199
with no casualties

429
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,280
The battle plan

430
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:30,439
was made so perfectly

431
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,520
within 6-8 hours

432
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,160
We can't underestimate the Desert's power

433
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:36,000
Their tactics are from Chinese
这是中原人的打法

434
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,599
Pu Sa and Yi Nan don't know about them

435
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,479
Is it Changge's plan?

436
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,000
So terrible

437
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:44,959
Sun

438
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:46,760
You should think seriously

439
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:48,959
Her IQ is so high
这女人的心思太可怕了

440
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:50,800
I worry you would be played by her

441
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,479
You've thought too much

442
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:55,760
Tegin,something is wrong

443
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,119
Tu Kashe rushs out of the circle

444
00:23:57,239 --> 00:23:58,319
with help of the Bear Division

445
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,319
We can't let him escape

446
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:02,719
Hah

447
00:24:02,719 --> 00:24:03,359
Hah

448
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,359
Who is it?

449
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,000
Sun

450
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,040
Why are you here?

451
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,119
Do you want to betray the Great Khan?

452
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:53,520
I just want to live

453
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,680
I want my Eagle Division to survive

454
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,239
Do you deserve to live?

455
00:24:58,239 --> 00:24:59,400
You son of a bitch

456
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:01,000
You are just a slave

457
00:25:01,239 --> 00:25:02,479
You couldn't live today

458
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,400
without the Great Khan's mercy

459
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,959
I'll never forget

460
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:07,119
the Great Khan's fostering love to me

461
00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:09,160
I'll repay Great Khan

462
00:25:09,719 --> 00:25:11,319
with my own way

463
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:13,400
in the future

464
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,479
Bah

465
00:25:15,439 --> 00:25:17,239
Do you repay him by this?

466
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,199
There is no good guy in the Eagle Division

467
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,880
And you,Mu Jin

468
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:23,199
You are the most shameless

469
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,280
You'll be dead men

470
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,160
I'll report everything

471
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,079
to the Great Khan

472
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,079
You both will be executed

473
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,400
You are so cocky

474
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:34,800
That's all right

475
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,920
Tu Kashe,I'll kill you tonight

476
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:24,239
The chiefs send me here

477
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:25,119
to tell you that

478
00:26:25,239 --> 00:26:26,319
the plan has succeeded

479
00:26:26,479 --> 00:26:27,239
Just wait for the Eagle Division coming back

480
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,199
with relief

481
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:29,959
Thank you

482
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,400
Now that

483
00:26:37,439 --> 00:26:38,479
the plan was done,

484
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,640
I should go back

485
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:43,319
Where do you go?

486
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,079
The Eagle Division or the capital?

487
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:55,800
Mimi

488
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:58,800
I once wanted to ask you that

489
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,359
how did you know

490
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,000
the Bear Division would destroy the Eagle Division

491
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:05,199
You a kind girl,

492
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:06,560
or you wouldn't

493
00:27:06,719 --> 00:27:08,000
speak it out

494
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,199
If you have any trouble,

495
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,640
you can tell me

496
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:12,599
We are together

497
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,760
to find ways to settle it

498
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,359
I'd told you

499
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:20,359
I have a younger brother

500
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,280
You've told me this

501
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,280
your family was ruined

502
00:27:23,439 --> 00:27:24,680
by the Ashile Tribe

503
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:26,800
Your younger brother died

504
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:30,520
Is he still alive?
你弟弟没死

505
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,400
You mean...

506
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,520
He is in the capital now?

507
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,920
No he's in Dingxiang

508
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:42,199
Yi Cheng did this

509
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:43,920
She threatened me

510
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:44,800
with my younger brother,

511
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,760
and forced me to 

512
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,359
get in the Eagle Division

513
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,479
Changge

514
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:54,239
I had no choice

515
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,880
I only want to die now

516
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,760
Mimi

517
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,640
You didn't hurt the Eagle Division,

518
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,439
You've helped it

519
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,760
Now the Eagle Division is "dead"

520
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:06,280
You should get relieved

521
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,719
How?

522
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:09,119
If my younger brother is still alive,

523
00:28:09,239 --> 00:28:11,000
he would wait for me to save him

524
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,079
Mimi

525
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:13,640
We'll talk about it

526
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,640
when

527
00:28:14,719 --> 00:28:15,680
everyone comes back

528
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
You just remember that

529
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,640
the Eagle Division has been destroyed

530
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,839
You are dead,too

531
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:20,800
Nothing 

532
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,640
can threaten you

533
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:24,160
Forget

534
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,800
past

535
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:27,479
We'll start a new life

536
00:28:28,439 --> 00:28:29,760
in future

537
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,239
Start a new life

538
00:28:34,239 --> 00:28:36,160
Can I really start a new life?

539
00:28:37,959 --> 00:28:40,000
The past Mimi has been dead

540
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,599
The future Mimi

541
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:43,319
will be a new Mimi

542
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,439
You can do what you want to

543
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,079
boldly and freely

544
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,520
Wait them back

545
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:52,160
Let's find some ways together

546
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:53,520
to save your younger brother out

547
00:29:07,199 --> 00:29:07,800
Sun

548
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:09,079
Wait

549
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,680
Give me your helmet

550
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,280
We should leave something as evidence

551
00:29:16,719 --> 00:29:17,880
for deaths of the Eagle Division and the Bear Division

552
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:18,920
Mu Jin

553
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:21,400
You don't have to do this

554
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:22,359
Sun

555
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,319
Some one should go back to report

556
00:29:24,959 --> 00:29:26,239
We were never separated before

557
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:28,280
Only if I go back alone,

558
00:29:28,479 --> 00:29:29,920
and tell them you are dead,

559
00:29:30,239 --> 00:29:31,439
they would believe me

560
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,839
You must live well

561
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,400
Don't worry

562
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,199
The plague hasn't taken my life

563
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:47,319
I won't die so easily

564
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:48,439
So...

565
00:29:49,439 --> 00:29:50,199
you won't meet

566
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:51,280
Mimi in a long time

567
00:29:55,239 --> 00:29:55,880
It doesn't matter

568
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,400
I go back

569
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:58,959
for another personal purpose

570
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:03,800
Take care of yourself

571
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:07,599
Hah

572
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:08,719
Hah

573
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:10,560
Hah

574
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,400
Hah

575
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,040
Hah

576
00:30:25,239 --> 00:30:25,760
Hah

577
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:29,479
Hah

578
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,079
Mimi

579
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:41,359
Where are you going?

580
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,439
Look

581
00:30:46,239 --> 00:30:47,000
I am back to

582
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,560
make the guys in the capital

583
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,680
to believe me

584
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,880
You can't go back

585
00:30:51,239 --> 00:30:52,959
They won't let you go anymore

586
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:55,640
Mimi

587
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:57,560
Trust me

588
00:30:58,119 --> 00:30:59,239
I'll come back

589
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,920
I've promised you
我答应过

590
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,560
I'll find some ways

591
00:31:02,719 --> 00:31:03,920
to save your younger brother out

592
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,199
But Dingxiang is guarded tightly

593
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,199
How do you

594
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:12,520
save him alone?

595
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,119
Let me go with you

596
00:31:19,239 --> 00:31:20,000
OK?

597
00:31:27,439 --> 00:31:28,040
Mimi

598
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,760
I'm a man

599
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,000
A man should

600
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,640
do what a man can do

601
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:36,239
Promise me

602
00:31:37,199 --> 00:31:38,560
Live well

603
00:31:40,239 --> 00:31:41,160
Wait for me back

604
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,280
You are mine

605
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:05,719
You should care about me

606
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,599
So you must come back

607
00:32:44,439 --> 00:32:45,199
When I come back,

608
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,920
I won't leave you anymore

609
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,400
Hah

610
00:32:56,239 --> 00:32:58,000
I waiting for you back

611
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:49,920
It's all over

612
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:52,280
I come to get you back

613
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,760
Last night I was worrying that

614
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,079
the plan would change,

615
00:33:59,199 --> 00:34:00,439
Tu Kashe would see through our plan,

616
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:01,880
and something bad would happen to you

617
00:34:03,199 --> 00:34:03,839
But...

618
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,199
I thank you,Sun

619
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,280
You have won

620
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:08,399
I'm back

621
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,879
The Eagle Division won't

622
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,800
exist anymore

623
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,280
The Tegin of Eagle Division won't exist,either

624
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,280
Do you feel regretful?

625
00:34:22,439 --> 00:34:23,919
The current result is the best

626
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,679
The Eagle Division won't be disturbed

627
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,959
by selfish desire,

628
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,520
and won't be used by others 

629
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,679
as a killing knife
做杀戮之刀

630
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,080
Although the Eagle Division has gone,
不过虽然鹰师没了

631
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:33,520
you can't forget 
但有笔账

632
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,199
your promise

633
00:34:36,479 --> 00:34:37,520
What is it?

634
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,320
When you recommended yourself

635
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,239
as my military counsellor

636
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:43,919
You promised me

637
00:34:43,959 --> 00:34:45,000
to do 3 things

638
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:48,439
Do you keep your words?

639
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,239
I'm surprised you still remember that

640
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,800
I always

641
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,560
keep my words

642
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:56,479
Since you mention it,

643
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,040
I think you have worked out them

644
00:34:58,199 --> 00:34:59,040
Tell me about them

645
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,719
I don't know how to say

646
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:02,479
but I have been thinking of

647
00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:04,080
the first thing long enough

648
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:06,840
Would you become

649
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,479
more girlish in future?

650
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,360
You mean...

651
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,280
I'm not like a girl?

652
00:35:17,439 --> 00:35:18,280
No,no

653
00:35:18,439 --> 00:35:19,639
How can I think like that

654
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:22,360
I just care about you

655
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:23,879
You always

656
00:35:23,879 --> 00:35:25,080
fight regardless of your life,

657
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,399
and work hard to plan

658
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:28,479
Military counsellor

659
00:35:29,479 --> 00:35:30,399
Give me a chance

660
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:32,600
Let me fulfill a man's responsibility

661
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,760
I'll protect you

662
00:35:36,919 --> 00:35:37,959
But I know that

663
00:35:38,879 --> 00:35:40,040
You are like a wild horse that can't be tethered

664
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,679
You have your own world

665
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,520
I respect your choice

666
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,439
I won't stop you

667
00:35:43,479 --> 00:35:44,320
from doing what you want to

668
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:46,840
No matter what kind of situation we are in,

669
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:49,320
you can't risk yourself alone

670
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,000
You can't leave silently

671
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,439
No matter what happens,

672
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,320
we'll go thought it together

673
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,919
No matter dealing with hardship

674
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,479
or risking life,

675
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:00,199
I would undertake all

676
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,080
Do you understand me?

677
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:06,159
Well

678
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,800
I'll think about it

679
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:20,919
Sun

680
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,639
Sun

681
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,840
Sun

682
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:29,120
Sun

683
00:36:29,439 --> 00:36:30,840
Sun,don't scare me

684
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,000
Sun

685
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,320
Someone coming here

686
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,560
Someone

687
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:36,199
Sun

688
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,679
Sun

689
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,639
Who are you?

690
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:30,239
The Eagle Division and the Bear Division

691
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,800
have been completely annihilated

692
00:38:00,439 --> 00:38:02,439
Why do they demolish the capital?

693
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,479
They want to move the capital?

694
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:09,239
What the hell is going on?

695
00:38:13,479 --> 00:38:14,600
How could two main forces

696
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,360
be completely annihilated?

697
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,120
What does Ashile Sun

698
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:19,879
want to do?

699
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,120
What can a dead man

700
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:22,919
intend to do?

701
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,919
Sun is dead

702
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:29,320
I don't want to live,too

703
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,840
If you want to kill me,

704
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:34,120
just do it

705
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:41,280
Sun is the god of war in the Grassland

706
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:44,040
Nobody can kill him

707
00:38:44,919 --> 00:38:46,280
Though he is very heroic,he can't prevent

708
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,520
knives from stabbing him from behind

709
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:50,479
Too many people

710
00:38:50,959 --> 00:38:53,159
want to kill him

711
00:38:53,919 --> 00:38:55,040
Nevertheless,

712
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:57,360
Sun ordered me to come back

713
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,600
before he died

714
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:00,840
He let me report to his father,our Khan,that

715
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,399
the Desert has united together

716
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:06,439
The Ashile Tribe must be stay alert

717
00:39:11,879 --> 00:39:12,959
The Desert

718
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:15,840
That's good

719
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:19,120
I'll let them

720
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,800
pay for Ashile Sun

721
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,679
My Queen

722
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,239
Get up,please

723
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,600
It's such a pity about

724
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:46,760
the Eagle Division and the Bear Division

725
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:49,159
I worry about Khan

726
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,280
who can't get over the pain of losing son

727
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:53,639
It'll be bad if his sickness gets worse

728
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,360
So we'll tell him

729
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,760
when his body gets better

730
00:39:58,199 --> 00:39:59,679
Our Great Khan is sick?

731
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,760
It has been in a period of time

732
00:40:03,479 --> 00:40:04,840
He can't even

733
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,919
speak now

734
00:40:07,399 --> 00:40:08,399
What kind of disease?

735
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,320
I have no idea 

736
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:13,879
Great Wizards are trying to find some ways

737
00:40:14,439 --> 00:40:15,399
It's a pity that

738
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,120
we haven't told

739
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,760
Tegin Sun this in time,

740
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,399
he and his father are

741
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,199
separated forever

742
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:28,600
So...
对了

743
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,040
You just said that

744
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,679
Tegin Sun's death has other reasons

745
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:35,760
This...

746
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,120
Don't be scared

747
00:40:38,879 --> 00:40:40,360
If it's ture,

748
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,679
The Great Khan will claim justice

749
00:40:42,879 --> 00:40:44,800
for Tegin Sun and the Eagle Division

750
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,479
My Queen

751
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,959
There existed a traitor in the Eagle Division

752
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:53,000
All people were murdered

753
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,840
by that traitor

754
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,760
It was my fault

755
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,439
I shouldn't take her

756
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,120
to the battlefield

757
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:01,159
She attacked Sun from behind

758
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,120
Who is she?

759
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,840
I don't know

760
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,439
As I was about to interrogate her,
我准备问她的时候

761
00:41:07,919 --> 00:41:09,399
she committed suicide

762
00:41:11,399 --> 00:41:12,719
Untill now,

763
00:41:13,439 --> 00:41:15,159
I don't know who sent her to kill Sun

764
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,840
I need to tell these stories to

765
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,959
women and children of the Eagle Division

766
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,399
Please,submit it to Great Khan

767
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,840
Khan sent

768
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,879
the Eagle Division and the Bear Division

769
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,159
to suppress rebellion

770
00:42:06,879 --> 00:42:08,879
But they got ambushed

771
00:42:10,879 --> 00:42:13,120
What a pity

772
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,840
Khan,

773
00:42:17,959 --> 00:42:19,399
are you familiar with this?

774
00:42:21,479 --> 00:42:25,320
Look at it carefully

775
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:36,719
It seems that Khan's sickness is not serious,

776
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,280
You can recognize that

777
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,639
this is Ashile Sun's helmet
阿诗勒隼的头盔

778
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:54,439
You miss him every day and night

779
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,439
So let him

780
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,959
stay with you forever
