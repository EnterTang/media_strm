00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,960
This week on VICE, Boko Haram's campaign of terror

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,050
spreads across Africa.

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,810
Behind me is a compound

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,060
which two days ago was the site

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,980
of a suicide attack.

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,310
And then, advances with our genetic code

9
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:33,280
are changing the future of human evolution.

10
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,820
We're at the National Resource Center for Mutant Mice.

11
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:39,160
They're editing the mouse embryos right here.

12
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,040
The couple wants a baby with blue eyes.

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,660
They said, "Can we get a boy,

14
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,630
and can the boy have blue eyes?"

15
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,480
The deadliest terror group in the world today

16
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,490
isn't ISIS or Al Qaeda.

17
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,410
According to a recent report,

18
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,690
it's the Nigerian terrorist group Boko Haram.

19
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,690
And even after six years of war with the military,

20
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,360
Boko Haram is as deadly as ever,

21
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,280
finding new ways to implement

22
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,790
their terror tactics in the region.

23
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,350
This pile of rubble that I'm standing on

24
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,300
was Mohammed Yusuf, the founder of Boko Haram's mosque.

25
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,800
Boko Haram began

26
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,890
right here at this very spot as a religious movement.

27
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,690
Yusuf preached hard-line Islam.

28
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,230
The name "Boko Haram" Roughly translates

29
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,060
to "Western education is sinful."

30
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,060
But he was also an outspoken critic

31
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,600
of government corruption and was accused of leading

32
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,200
violent attacks against authorities.

33
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,910
The police executed him without trial in 2009.

34
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,170
I wanted to get the government's perspective

35
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,050
on how Yusuf's death contributed to Boko Haram's rise,

36
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,090
so we spoke to Nigeria's president

37
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,920
Muhammadu Buhari.

38
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,530
Boko Haram's new leader, Abubakar Shekau,

39
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,870
used that sense of injustice to transform the group

40
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,340
into a fearsome paramilitary force

41
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,960
that in 2015 controlled

42
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,130
thousands of square miles of Nigerian territory.

43
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,800
When I reported on this story in March last year,

44
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,430
the Nigerian army was engaged in a full-scale

45
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,430
military campaign against the group.

46
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,150
Since that report, Boko Haram has gone underground,

47
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,120
embracing terrorist guerrilla tactics instead.

48
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,620
In 2015, thousands of more people died

49
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,320
in more than 230 attacks.

50
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,160
So I went back to Nigeria

51
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,580
to see how the face of this conflict has changed.

52
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,490
I spoke to Kashim Shettima,

53
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:35,460
the governor of the hardest-hit state.

54
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,380
How do you categorize how the war,

55
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,590
or the conflict, is progressing?

56
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,080
But that's a daunting task,

57
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,330
considering how difficult it is to figure out

58
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,620
who actually is Boko Haram.

59
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,790
I'm in this heavily armed convoy of about 30 vehicles,

60
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,040
including an armored personnel carrier.

61
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,010
And this road, which has been

62
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,040
frequently attacked by the insurgents,

63
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,050
leads to the Sambisa Forest.

64
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:27,100
Sambisa Forest is the last known stronghold of Boko Haram.

65
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,050
The governor had come to this village,

66
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,050
newly recaptured from Boko Haram,

67
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,140
to calm the local population.

68
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,690
But the residents here

69
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,190
had already taken matters into their own hands.

70
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,700
I heard that they arrested four Boko Haram in this village.

71
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,030
They've put them, like, on parade.

72
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,290
What's wrong with these guys?

73
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,320
What's wrong with his friends?

74
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,920
Tell me about these guys. Who are these guys?

75
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,970
Why did they come?

76
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,230
One of the key elements

77
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,270
of fighting this counter-insurgency

78
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,190
has been civilian militia

79
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,270
capturing a lot of the members of Boko Haram

80
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,440
and turning them over to the military.

81
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:24,090
You know him?

82
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,690
How?

83
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,350
Many Boko Haram they caught--

84
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,120
they will mention this particular person.

85
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,120
He's a bad type, notorious.

86
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,340
He's notorious?

87
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,290
Very dangerous, very dangerous.

88
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:43,210
What has this guy done that makes him so bad?

89
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,470
He is their gang leader.

90
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,970
He's killed people-- this guy?

91
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,220
Yes, he is killing people.

92
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,730
As government forces detain more and more

93
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,610
alleged Boko Haram members,

94
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,240
innocent civilians are getting caught in the middle.

95
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,820
Auto mechanic Saleh Isa Babawo

96
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,820
was arrested last year and taken

97
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,130
to Giwa Barracks-- the local jail.

98
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,250
-This is a burn? -Yeah.

99
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,390
Fuck.

100
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,590
What is this? What happened here?

101
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,010
Oh, from being tied up?

102
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,480
It just ripped away your flesh?

103
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,680
Do you think the conditions in Giwa Barracks--

104
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,770
the way they treat you and other innocent people--

105
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:44,070
has created a backlash against the security forces?

106
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,500
Stories like this are just the tip of the iceberg.

107
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,530
Lucy Freeman, an investigator for Amnesty International,

108
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:59,030
says that in the hunt for Boko Haram,

109
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,000
the military has been committing

110
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,340
mass atrocities of its own.

111
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:07,040
We recently released a report documenting

112
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,550
very serious human rights violations by the military.

113
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,880
We found that they had committed war crimes.

114
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,850
One of the most horrific cases

115
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,850
that we documented in this report

116
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,050
was on the 14th of March, 2014.

117
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,610
There's a large military detention center in Northeast Nigeria

118
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,390
called Giwa Barracks.

119
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,190
And on that day, Boko Haram came

120
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,810
and attacked the barracks.

121
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,980
They freed the prisoners there, over a thousand people.

122
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,740
A large number of people tried to go home to their families.

123
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,870
They were rounded up by the military and the civilian JTF,

124
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,830
and we documented the execution of at least 620 of them.

125
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,880
We received video footage from that particular day,

126
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:48,630
which showed these men lined up next to a large pit.

127
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,500
And a man dressed in military uniform

128
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,810
then cuts their throat.

129
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,850
None of those people have been brought to justice.

130
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,150
Abuses like this only strengthen

131
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,680
Boko Haram's resolve.

132
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:09,240
In 2015, more than 10,000 people were killed,

133
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,820
making it the deadliest year yet.

134
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,610
To get their point of view on the Giwa Barracks raid,

135
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,500
we gained unprecedented access

136
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:19,950
to an active Boko Haram commander and his deputy.

137
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,420
How many members do you have?

138
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,040
What's wrong with your leg?

139
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,210
You have a bullet? How did that happen?

140
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,770
Was this the attack on Giwa Barracks?

141
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,490
You're not afraid to fight with soldiers?

142
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,750
You don't think you'll be killed?

143
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,380
We wanted to know if the commander

144
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,840
was involved in the group's most infamous attack--

145
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,510
the kidnapping of nearly 300 girls

146
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,430
from a school in Chibok,

147
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,730
which sparked outrage around the world.

148
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:26,430
Everybody is talking about the Chibok girls.

149
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,740
Where are they?

150
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,670
So they're now a bargaining chip?

151
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,130
While the Chibok girls remain missing,

152
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,350
this is far from an isolated incident.

153
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,220
In the town of Yola, we met 16-year-old Zainab,

154
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,110
who's one of thousands of women

155
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,390
who have been abducted by Boko Haram.

156
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:39,250
But they don't just marry these girls.

157
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:42,310
They've begun using them in their attacks.

158
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:04,280
Zainab escaped after five months in captivity,

159
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,370
but not before she was impregnated by one of her captors.

160
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,870
As the cycle of violence continues to build,

161
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:37,620
it's now spilled outside of Nigeria's borders.

162
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:40,710
Is Boko Haram spreading to the region?

163
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,450
To see how far the fight had spread,

164
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,230
I traveled to N'Djamena, Chad,

165
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:05,950
where the conflict shows no signs of slowing down.

166
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,070
Behind me is a compound

167
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:10,070
which two days ago was the site

168
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,830
of a bloody Boko Haram suicide attack.

169
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,060
Did you find any materials or anything,

170
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,430
any bomb-making materials?

171
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,270
What they found was a small arsenal

172
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,280
intended to launch more of these attacks around Chad.

173
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,910
This is an RPG round right here.

174
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,120
This bag has, I'd estimate, like, 15 to 20 RPG rounds in it.

175
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:05,130
As the hunt for Boko Haram escalates in Chad,

176
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,630
these soldiers say that militants from around the region

177
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:12,050
are still joining up to wage jihad.

178
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,360
Most of the Boko Haram-- they're Kanuri, right?

179
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,540
Now it's everybody?

180
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,230
From Mali,

181
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,820
Bamako, Timbuktu?

182
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,950
That's bad.

183
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,490
It gets worse. Boko Haram,

184
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,990
which killed more people in terror attacks than ISIS in 2014,

185
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:39,880
has actually pledged allegiance to them,

186
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,660
even renaming themselves

187
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,580
the Islamic State's West Africa Province.

188
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,340
This new alliance between Boko Haram and ISIS

189
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,140
does not bode well for the region.

190
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,540
Since the beginning of life on Earth,

191
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,540
evolution has been steered by the demands of survival

192
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,510
in the natural world.

193
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,460
However, today, new technology

194
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,380
is completely upending that process,

195
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,960
allowing us to alter different species as we go forward,

196
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,550
including our own.

197
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:49,310
So how is it that the mosquitoes are genetically modified?

198
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,980
What's different about these guys than any other mosquitoes?

199
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,860
These mosquitoes have been genetically modified

200
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,470
to breed with, and eliminate, their own species

201
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:11,890
in an urgent attempt to wipe out carriers of dengue fever.

202
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:15,340
Every week, 800,000 of these mosquitoes

203
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,730
are being released into the wild.

204
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,390
It's crazy to think

205
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,900
that you're trying to solve the dengue fever problem

206
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,000
by releasing so many mosquitoes into the wild.

207
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,990
Neighborhoods targeted by the program

208
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,020
are seeing a more than 90% reduction

209
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,990
in dengue-carrying mosquitoes.

210
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,660
These doctored mosquitoes are part of a larger movement

211
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,420
to produce animals that fight the diseases they spread.

212
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,780
In Scotland, in the same facility

213
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,450
that produced Dolly the sheep,

214
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,290
the first-ever cloned animal,

215
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,690
Dr. Bruce Whitelaw is trying to create pigs

216
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,880
He's an expert in a field called transgenics.

217
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,470
So what "Transgenic" Means

218
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,830
is that you've taken a gene

219
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,970
which you have constructed in the laboratory,

220
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,220
and you've introduced it into the genome of the animal.

221
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,390
When you look at this snout here,

222
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,890
you'll see it's got a yellow tinge to it.

223
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,560
Hey, piggy, piggy.

224
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,280
So what they've done is,

225
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,530
they've taken the fluorescent gene,

226
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,900
which is naturally present in jellyfish,

227
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:19,150
and they've put it inside these pigs as a little marker,

228
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,210
so they know which ones are transgenic or not.

229
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:24,490
In the past, genetic engineering technologies

230
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,500
often used visual markers like this

231
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,380
to prove that they even worked.

232
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,970
But the science has recently taken a huge step forward.

233
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,420
The breakthrough is a molecular technology

234
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,340
called CRISPR CAS-9.

235
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,560
It's a protein that uses molecular blades

236
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,430
to make cuts in host DNA,

237
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,510
replacing genes you don't want with genes you do.

238
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,520
It has the power to transform

239
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,430
every form of life as we know it.

240
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,190
It's all about a way of editing genes, known as CRISPR.

241
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,690
CRISPR is being described as a game changer.

242
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,690
Breakthrough Prize is awarded to

243
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,830
Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna.

244
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,670
Jennifer Doudna, a leading professor of chemistry and biology

245
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,370
at UC Berkeley, codiscovered CRISPR.

246
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,120
Really, what we're doing with the CRISPR technology is,

247
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,460
we're using it as a scalpel,

248
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,540
a very precise cleaver,

249
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,630
that makes breaks in the DNA

250
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:19,380
where we as scientists want to introduce changes.

251
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:25,390
DNA is the computer program that runs the cell.

252
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,060
What if there's a mistake somewhere in that code?

253
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,610
CRISPR technology allows us to find the place

254
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,230
where this mistake has occurred in the DNA

255
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,450
and allow the cell to correct that mistake.

256
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,490
And within just a few months

257
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,570
of our publication of our initial work,

258
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:46,070
many scientists were testing it in plants, animals,

259
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,660
and in all cases it was working extremely well.

260
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,410
We really have to actually for the first time

261
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,580
confront this possibility

262
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,840
of being able to alter human beings in the future

263
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,760
and the wisdom of doing that.

264
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,890
One reason for that caution

265
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,760
is that CRISPR edits are so easy to apply across all species.

266
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:10,020
At New York University, researcher Michael Perry

267
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,680
is looking at the genes that affect butterflies' vision.

268
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:15,520
In this case, we're gonna try to edit a gene

269
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:18,690
that we think might be involved in making the butterfly eye

270
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,330
able to see more colors than other types of insects.

271
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:25,750
Okay, so now the needle is in the egg.

272
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,120
So now you can see some yolk being displaced.

273
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,920
-Yeah. -Okay, and that's it.

274
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,670
-It's as simple as that? -It's as simple as that.

275
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,290
That's one edited gene?

276
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,460
That is one edited genome.

277
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,710
So how different would this process look

278
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,790
if you were injecting human embryos?

279
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,260
Not my specialty.

280
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:45,020
In theory, applying CRISPR to humans

281
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,140
could eliminate diseases and steer our evolution.

282
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,520
The problem is that so far,

283
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,810
we can't always predict what will happen.

284
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,030
The antennae is drooping.

285
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,610
Its legs haven't formulated properly.

286
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,950
And the color is gone on the wings.

287
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,200
Right.

288
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,490
We knew from research in fruit flies

289
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,570
that this gene played a role in developing antennae

290
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,820
and in producing bristles on the legs,

291
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,990
but we didn't expect a role in wing pattern.

292
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,400
And so, even in this gene that was reasonably well studied,

293
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,630
we could predict what some of the effects would be.

294
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,000
We did not expect a role in color pattern.

295
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,000
Do you think that this kind of technology

296
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:23,510
will fundamentally impact our future?

297
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,170
Everyone is excited about CRISPR.

298
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,890
I think it really is gonna change biology in general.

299
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,060
While CRISPR is not yet considered safe

300
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,930
to use on human embryos,

301
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,150
genetic selection is already happening in the US.

302
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,150
Dr. Jeffrey Steinberg is using a process known as PGD

303
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,110
to genetically analyze embryos

304
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,190
and allow parents to screen for diseases

305
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,080
and even choose favorable traits in their children.

306
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,080
PGD starts for Pre-implantation--

307
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,080
before it goes back to Mom-- Genetic Diagnosis.

308
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,370
And that way we're able to make these decisions

309
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,040
that the parents want to make before they get the embryo.

310
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,420
Mm-hmm, and so the purpose of that is to identify

311
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,840
certain diseases that might exist in certain embryos...

312
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,790
-Exactly. -...and also the sex.

313
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,430
Right, we can identify gender

314
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,600
with almost 100% certainty.

315
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,130
-So what are we looking at here? -This is a PGD report.

316
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,970
So this is a PGD report from the laboratory.

317
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,020
So these embryos were biopsied yesterday.

318
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:15,310
So here we have an embryo--

319
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,280
46 chromosomes, which is normal.

320
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,940
XX means girl.

321
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,900
The next one-- 46 chromosomes, also normal.

322
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,070
But it's XY instead of XX.

323
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,530
So this is a normal male.

324
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,490
The couple wants a baby with blue eyes.

325
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,910
They've got three girls. They said, "Can we get a boy,

326
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,540
and can the boy have blue eyes?"

327
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,490
And what we got back was a report showing

328
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,130
that embryo number five and embryo number seven

329
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,050
carry the genes for blue eyes.

330
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:39,780
It's just a case of

331
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,330
selecting which ones you want to put in there.

332
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,390
Exactly. Exactly. So we asked Mom and Dad,

333
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,590
"Here's what we've got. What do you want?"

334
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:49,260
We met with Deborah and Jonathan,

335
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,730
one of thousands of couples across the country

336
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:55,230
who have chosen to use PGD.

337
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,270
It sounds like a no-brainer, you know,

338
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,650
if you want to be able to test for more diseases

339
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:02,520
and have the healthiest child that you can.

340
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:05,190
And you also chose to have sex selection, right?

341
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,690
Yep, right.

342
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,440
Yeah, we're picking a girl.

343
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,330
We both want to have a baby girl.

344
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,160
Were there any other traits that you were selecting for

345
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,880
or that you had the option to select for?

346
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,450
I think we'll be offered eye color.

347
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,450
Well, when we met with Dr. Steinberg, they're--

348
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,540
the advances they're making are pretty incredible.

349
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,590
We had no idea about eye color,

350
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,630
but that is something that he offers. We're not doing eye color.

351
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,110
You're going in for your

352
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,850
actual retrieval process tomorrow, is that right?

353
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:34,190
How are you feeling? Very nervous.

354
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,270
So here we go, a little pinch.

355
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,140
Just hold real still.

356
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,060
In Dr. Steinberg's clinic,

357
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,140
Deborah's eggs were removed to be fertilized

358
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,900
and then genetically analyzed.

359
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,650
So we finished the first two. We're gonna pass that off.

360
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,200
So they've got the fluid now.

361
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,400
They're gonna be taking a look under the microscope

362
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,650
and we'll find that first egg for you.

363
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:58,540
And here you can see what these technicians are doing.

364
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,660
This is an egg?

365
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,130
Two eggs?

366
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,470
A little pinch again.

367
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,090
Here comes another one.

368
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,340
Just egg-hunting.

369
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,510
16 eggs.

370
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,340
You did great.

371
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,100
We're taking one sperm, and we're injecting it

372
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,680
into the yolk of the human egg.

373
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,900
There's the needle. You can see one little sperm

374
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,850
swimming up inside of the needle.

375
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:28,690
And now he's very gently going to push the tip of the needle

376
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:33,030
into the yolk of the egg.

377
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,030
So that's it?

378
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,030
It's fertilized. It's a fertilized egg.

379
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,870
Wow.

380
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,650
So where's this PGD technology heading?

381
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,920
What's next, after eye color?

382
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,790
The next place that it's headed

383
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,590
is towards being able to diagnose more and more diseases.

384
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,540
And the final place that it's headed

385
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,130
is into allowing us to select more and more

386
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:53,520
elective traits, characteristics.

387
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,680
Such as?

388
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,850
Height, weight.

389
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,800
How soon before we can select for height?

390
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:01,720
I mean, I can give you a five-year estimate.

391
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,730
Five years before we can select for height? Yeah.

392
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,950
The global push to develop these technologies

393
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,950
is only intensifying.

394
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,950
So we spoke to Jamie Metzl,

395
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,450
an expert in both genomics and foreign policy.

396
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,910
Ultimately, humans are a data set.

397
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,120
And as our computing power increases,

398
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,660
we're able to look at these extremely complex genetics

399
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,960
and then pull all the pieces together

400
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,970
and do genome-wide association studies

401
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,550
to try to figure out what genes do what.

402
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,470
So does that mean that the countries

403
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:34,170
or the societies with the most data on genetics

404
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,260
are leading the way in terms of national competitiveness?

405
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:40,430
We are at the very early stage of this revolution.

406
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,560
And, like in any revolution

407
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:45,100
and any transformation, first movers

408
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,850
always have a strategic advantage.

409
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,520
China has identified biotechnology

410
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,440
as a strategic pillar

411
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,440
in their most recent five-year plan.

412
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,700
That 2011 plan devoted

413
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:01,120
more than $308 billion to biotechnology.

414
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,170
It's paving the way for a large-scale,

415
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,590
assembly-line approach to decoding

416
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,960
the specific functions of genes.

417
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,930
In Nanjing, CRISPR technology is now being used

418
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,530
to edit the genes of mice,

419
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:14,800
in an effort to isolate desired traits.

420
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,680
We're at the National Resource Center for Mutant Mice.

421
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,020
This is where they edit hundreds of thousands

422
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,050
of different types of mice.

423
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,560
What we're looking at down these microscopes

424
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,720
are tiny, tiny little mouse embryos.

425
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,940
And what they're doing is, they're injecting them.

426
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:31,400
So they're editing the mouse embryos right here.

427
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,960
Wow, that's a lot of embryos.

428
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,880
Wow.

429
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,050
What are they doing here?

430
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,350
These guys here are being edited,

431
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,350
so the result is that they're completely bald.

432
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:14,690
These ones here-- they're missing

433
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,520
the metabolism gene,

434
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,530
which means that they're very, very fat.

435
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,660
In this room, they could hold the key

436
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,530
to curing aging,

437
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,620
to curing diabetes, to curing cancer.

438
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,700
There's just so much possibility

439
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,870
held in this room of rodents.

440
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:32,420
The mouse genome is 85% similar to the human genome,

441
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,340
so unlocking their gene functions

442
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:37,380
could be critical to understanding our own traits.

443
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,260
And that could be huge here,

444
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:43,380
where pre-birth services are already in massive demand.

445
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,390
We watched as couples lined up down the block

446
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,690
for different types of fertility procedures.

447
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,610
Some of these people have been queuing

448
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:53,140
outside this Beijing public hospital since 2:00 a.M.

449
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,950
It's like a stampede in here.

450
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,370
Everyone's just racing to get an appointment

451
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,240
so they can hopefully see an IVF doctor.

452
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,240
And as thousands and thousands of couples

453
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:06,290
choose the latest available treatments,

454
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:09,130
the future is quickly approaching.

455
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,550
Companies are now developing sequences

456
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,170
that decode genes at record speeds.

457
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,920
And all that data will eventually be funneled here,

458
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:20,050
into one of the largest gene banks in the world.

459
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,010
In here, they're gonna be storing

460
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,060
1.15 million people's human genomes.

461
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,930
This is pretty representative

462
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,600
of China's massive commitment and big, big push

463
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,930
for the genetics industry.

464
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,850
But as the industry grows,

465
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,570
so does our concern about where it's headed.

466
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:38,070
Outrage over the latest move toward designer babies.

467
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,990
For the first time, Chinese scientists

468
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:43,830
use new technology to alter DNA in human embryos.

469
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:47,000
Serious implications of designer babies.

470
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,870
It will take us down a slippery slope.

471
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,790
This technology continues to advance.

472
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:56,040
And with parents potentially being offered

473
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:58,260
more and more traits for purchase,

474
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,260
we may be altering the future

475
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,350
of the human race itself.

476
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,930
So how much are we moving

477
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,470
towards a future of genetic haves and have-nots?

478
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:09,350
Certainly, there is the danger

479
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:13,310
of the more advantaged people in society today

480
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,860
becoming even more advantaged.

481
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,860
And that's very dangerous.

482
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,980
The worst-case scenario is

483
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:22,400
that we get into some type of genetic arms race,

484
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:26,120
where people are manufacturing their-- their children.

485
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:29,490
After four billion years of evolution,

486
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:31,330
we are now beginning a process

487
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,880
where we will take active control of our evolution.

488
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,830
And the consequences of that are incredible.

489
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,720
If you had a time machine,

490
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,000
and you traveled a thousand years into the future

491
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,880
and brought a child back to today,

492
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,880
that kid would be Superman.
