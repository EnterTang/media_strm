1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,070
I booked Moby-Dick!

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,070
And all you have to do is probably
have dinner with her. She's a widow.

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:09,300
If you're holding onto your pills then
I think you still have not decided.

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,440
Unbelievable.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,400
They don't show your fetus
hand on my fetus hand.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,260
- So what did you think?
- It was embarrassing.

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,630
He just needs to
express himself,you said.

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,720
- Look at him!
- This is a reaction to pot.

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,250
I have an appointment. I'm
wondering if you can stand in for me.

10
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,990
- Like a free dinner?
- I do not negotiate with degenerates.

11
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,400
I am cutting you off.

12
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,880
- She wants to see me again,Ray.
- She said that?

13

16
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,370
Okay,guys,why don't you
tell me why you're fighting.

17
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,790
How can I help you if I don't
know what the problem is?

18
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,670
What's going on at the house?

19
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,380
- Mom saw a beaver.
- She thought she did.

20
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,780
What's that supposed to mean?

21
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,200
Nobody else saw it,so you
draw your own conclusions.

22
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,310
Are you calling her a liar?

23
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,000
Well,where did it go? Beaverland?

24
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,860
- Guys.
- Maybe one of your fat friends ate the beaver.

25
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,020
Yeah,or maybe mom ate one of your
stupid scones and hallucinated it.

26
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,500
Guys,guys,knock it off.

27
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,370
What's up with you two?

28
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,240
You never used to
fight like this before.

29
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,080
Tell your mom she can borrow
my traps if she needs to.

30
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,170
- You tell her.
- Well,your mom and I...

31
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,350
Are not in the best place right now.

32
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,810
Because she's having a baby with Ronnie?

33
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,210
You guys are divorced. What do you care?

34
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,540
I don't. I'm just trying to be helpful.

35
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,600
Mom,I'm excited,I'm excited.
What do you want from me?

36
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,130
We need to celebrate life's victories.

37
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,500
Are you coming to my
dinner or not,Tanya?

38
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,300
Mom,look,I think it's great that
you're chair of cinema studies,

39
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,370
but,you know,I have a life too.

40
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,810
Uh,I have to go.

41
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,990
Hi,Frances.

42
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,750
Thank you so much for meeting me.

43
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,960
I'm,uh,so sorry.

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,070
What happened was not
right and not professional.

45
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,820
We don't bait and switch like at.

46
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,740
I promised you one thing and you got...

47
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,520
if you'll permit me,

48
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:09,920
I would like to reintroduce
you to Richard free of charge.

49
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,450
I'm not interested in Richard.

50
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,670
I understand.

51
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:17,080
I'd like to book Mike.

52
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,810
Mike?

53
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,660
You like Mike?

54
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,610
You guys had a good time?

55
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:32,010
Well,yes,we had a nice time
under the circumstances.

56
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,220
Mike was very considerate

57
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,030
and he has a very
attractive speaking voice.

58
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,100
I'm so happy to hear that.

59
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,160
So I would be willing to book him again.

60
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,260
That is if we could work
it out on a weekend basis.

61
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,850
I... a weekend basis?

62
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,840
Let's face it,Tanya,

63
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,370
your hourly rate is too high.

64
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,750
I want a flat rate.

65
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,160
Flat rate?

66
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,520
$1500 a weekend,

67
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,610
unlimited hours.

68
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,530
$1500?

69
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,810
that's fair.

70
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,590
I will call Mike and I will...

71
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,310
- I will let him know the details.
- Good.

72
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,980
I'd rather not talk money with...

73
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,040
it's odd,but I'd be embarrassed.

74
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,550
Somehow it's nicer to pretend.

75
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,980
Ray,Ray,we did it! We did it!

76
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,080
- We did it! We did it!
- What?

77
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,190
- We did it!
- Hey,will you put that away?

78
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:46,090
This is a neighborhood.
Where'd you get that?

79
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,500
Mike.

80
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,660
Frances is very taken with Mike.

81
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,060
Frances wants Mike to come back.

82
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,360
Ray. Ray,wait.

83
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,850
Seriously,look at this.

84
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,470
Ray,come on. Come on,Ray.

85
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,710
- Shit.
- I know,it's not what we planned.

86
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,070
It's not what we planned,but
it's a terrific turn of events.

87
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,420
So Frances paid all that money for Mike?

88
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,900
Yes,for the whole weekend.

89
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,920
Ray,she can't get enough of him.

90
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,140
So you... you go to Mike
and you talk to him for me.

91
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,840
And you make the introductions

92
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,120
and you explain to him that
I'm in charge of negotiations.

93
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,030
You just screw Lenore,Ray.

94
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,740
This is a whole new business model.

95
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,580
This is me and you and Mike.

96
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:28,770
Tanya,I need you to
give that money back.

97
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,100
- What?
- He likes her.

98
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,050
He won't even take the
500 bucks for the date.

99
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:37,530
He thinks it's about dinner
and being her companion.

100
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,560
Like a dating service. He's got
no idea about the rest of it.

101
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,760
Okay okay. So we go
to him and we ask him

102
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:46,000
and we see what he says.

103
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,390
He's a grown man. He can
make his own decisions.

104
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,640
I've known Mike for 15 years.

105
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,110
Not gonna do it.Okay?

106
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,800
You know,for the first time,

107
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:02,420
the guy's got a spring in his step.

108
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,480
Maybe they have a shot.

109
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,510
What?

110
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,970
Why do you want me to fail?

111
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:15,040
I don't want you to fail,Tanya.

112
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,950
I want us to succeed,okay?

113
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,630
Just not with Mike and not th Frances.

114
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:24,450
I know how hard you
worked on this whale,okay?

115
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,240
But we can find other...

116
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,690
How are we gonna get other clients
when you keep driving them away?

117
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,600
You find some reason
to sabotage them all.

118
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:36,050
I do not do that.I try hard.

119
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,350
Okay.

120
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,740
Look at this.

121
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,870
Just look at... look at this.

122
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:42,970
Um,this... this is what

123
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,110
Mike got after one night. Okay?

124
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:49,680
This is more than you ever
brought in in a whole week.

125
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:53,520
Okay? So what does he got,I'm
wondering,that you don't have?

126
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,460
Cut it out. I think maybe
he and Frances hit it off.

127
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,000
I mean,Mike got lucky.

128
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,290
- Obviously.
- Yeah,you're jealous.

129
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,930
You don't want Mike around

130
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,260
because you think he'll outperform you.

131
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,330
- Ridiculous.
- You can't stand to think

132
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:11,470
that somebody might be a
better lay than Ray Drecker.

133
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,470
Tanya,I never got a shot with her.

134
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,500
Remember me?

135
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,980
I am the guy who gets the crazy ones

136
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,080
and the married ones
and the pregnant ones.

137
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,910
Yeah,you do. Yeah,you do.

138
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,540
And where are all those
satisfied customers now?

139
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:31,750
Where is Molly? Where's
Claire?Where's Moby-Dick?

140
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,600
She's with Mike,Ray.

141
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,760
And me and you,we're with no one.

142
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,480
And I just think it's time
that we ask ourselves why.

143
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,730
Thank you,John. We will get back to you.

144
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,950
- Ron.
- One second,honey.

145
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,660
- I'm getting rid of the exterminator.
- What did he say?

146
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,760
So there's no beaver scat.
There's no other indicators.

147
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,700
Plus this isn't even
their natural habitat.

148
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,030
But I saw it,Ron.

149
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,340
There was a beaver sitting right there.

150
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,390
Beaver is dirty animal.

151
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:05,010
It carries giardiasis. Beaver fever.

152
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:07,700
I know what I saw,Ron.
Why won't you believe me?

153
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:11,860
I'd love to,but a very competent
man just told us otherwise.

154
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,110
- The beavers,they gnaw at foundation.
- We got it,ma.

155
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,350
Destroy property values.

156
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,150
Let's just see if this
beaver turns up again.

157
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,720
Ron,I am not bringing a baby
into a house full of beavers.

158
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,670
It's always something with you,Jess.

159
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,550
Today it's beavers,tomorrow
what... locusts?

160
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:32,550
It's not her fault you
have beaver problem.

161
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,070
Damn popcorn.

162
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:53,440
Frances met Mike and she
couldn't get enough of him.

163
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,280
Was I missing something?

164
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,430
What did he have that I didn't?

165
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,890
There you are.

166
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,860
- Hi.
- Where is she?

167
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,640
She's in the back reading room.

168
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,640
- Okay.
- Wait,Ray.

169
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,870
Look,I know we're acting
like everything's normal,

170
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,610
but I sense something is up.

171
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,420
Are you still mad at me about Jessica?

172
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,090
- Did you see her?
- I did.

173
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:21,240
Then I'm still mad about it.

174
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,970
Don't be,Ray.

175
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,880
I know you are having all these emotions

176
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,910
because she hired a
gigolo and almost got you.

177
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,810
But that's not my fault.

178
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,490
How was I supposed to know
Jessica is your ex-wife?

179
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:36,080
Look,I am her only friend,okay?

180
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,590
She needs me.

181
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:40,410
Why would I tell her about
us? Why would I do that?

182
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,840
I'm your pimp. I protect you.

183
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,290
I don't get why you're
being so suspicious.

184
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,660
Did Tanya put anti-Lenore
ideas in your head?

185
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,180
I'm gonna be late,Lenore.

186
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:55,910
Fine,she's back there.Second table to
the left,dark hair,red flowered dress.

187
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,830
Thank you.

188
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,010
- Richard?
- Hi.

189
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,200
Hi,I'm Liz.

190
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,680
You like libraries,huh?

191
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,840
Yeah,I love 'em.

192
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,620
And I figured,you know,I
don't know you so...

193
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,700
You,uh,want to walk around?

194
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,440
Yeah,sure.

195
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,380
Great.

196
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,670
I'm thinking we just talk right now.

197
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,990
What would you like to talk about?

198
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,410
About sex.

199
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,060
Well,say anything.

200
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,030
Right,um... the thing is,

201
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,360
I don't love sex.

202
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,420
Why not?

203
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,790
I don't understand what the deal is.

204
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,830
I... I mean,I'm normal.
Everything about me is normal.

205
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:59,910
It's just ever since I was a kid
I would see these women in movies

206
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,910
and they would be
screaming,"oh yes,oh yes,"

207
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,620
and sweating and fucking and loving it.

208
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:11,660
And for me sex is like not that.It's...

209
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,340
Maybe,uh...

210
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,190
You had the wrong lover.

211
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,940
Exactly. Maybe.

212
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:22,960
So I thought,you know,someone
who knows a lot about women,

213
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,320
someone who's a total stranger to me,

214
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:28,340
a white guy like you who's
not gonna know anyone I know,

215
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,990
might be good.

216
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,190
I mean,you are an expert,right?

217
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,310
Kinda.

218
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:40,450
So what do you think?

219
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,320
I think I'm the right man for the job.

220
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,460
Hey,Jess.So the kids said you
had a beaver running around.

221
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,780
Anyway,if you want i
still have those traps.

222
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,410
- He called me.
- Really?

223
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:04,300
Offered to help with the
beavers.I didn't call back.

224
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:09,100
Meanwhile,Ron does nothing.

225
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,130
I mean,maybe I should call him.

226
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,670
'Cause believe me,Ray
would be over in a flash.

227
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,730
Do you think he's still hot for you?

228
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,820
Who knows? I don't care.He's so...

229
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,610
Every time I look at him I
think,"that's over."That is over.

230
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:28,480
I can't."I can't go there."

231
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,080
But he's sexy,don't you think?

232
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,550
Sometimes.

233
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:37,240
But then at other times
he's just so stuck.

234
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,600
I know,in that burnt-out house.

235
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,710
Yeah,he can't get it together.

236
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,350
How did you know Ray's
house is burnt down?

237
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,450
What?

238
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:51,100
You just said Ray's burnt-out house?

239
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,320
Oh,'cause I ran into him.

240
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,010
You did?

241
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,060
Why didn't you tell me?

242
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,490
I know I should have,but...

243
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,520
Okay listen,Jess. I
got his phone number.

244
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,120
I feel bad. I like him.

245
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,180
You like him?

246
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,490
It's just I always date jerks,you know?

247
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,030
And he's like a real
guy. Like straight up.

248
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,560
You know?

249
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,490
If it bothers you I
won't take it further.

250
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,740
You're asking my permission to call him?

251
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,570
I swear I'll do whatever you want.

252
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,290
I don't want to hurt you.

253
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,730
Okay,I... call him.

254
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,700
I think you should call him.

255
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,720
You're single,he's
single.I mean,definitely.

256
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,590
Definitely. And do,you know,

257
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,680
whatever.

258
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,980
Thank you.

259
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,270
This is Ray.I lost my
old phone in the fire.

260
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,640
So make sure and leave your number.

261
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,610
Ray.

262
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:09,910
Hi. Sorry it's 2:00
in the morning but...

263
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,840
Those beaver traps
you were talking about,

264
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,540
could you bring them by tomorrow
and leave them out front?

265
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:20,930
Why? Why is it everybody all at
once?It's like there's all this crap.

266
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,950
And I never thought I'd
say this,but I think.

267
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:26,330
Ray might be deliberately
trying to sabotage me.

268
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,160
- Who's Ray?
- My prostitute.

269
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,690
Oh,right. That one ho that you share.

270
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,310
That I temporarily
share. Don't rub it in.

271
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,220
- Thank you,sir.
- I'm just fucking with you.

272
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,020
Thank you. Come on.

273
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,710
So should I give the money back or what?

274
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,910
- You're asking me?
- Well,no.

275
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,990
I mean,yeah. I mean,I can't keep
it.I'd be wracked with guilt.

276
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,670
- For how long?
- What do you mean?

277
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,780
For how long would you
be feeling guilty,huh?

278
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,230
For a minute? An hour? A month? A year?

279
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,850
- What?
- I don't know.

280
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,500
I've never taken anything
before.So how would I know?

281
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,570
Number one,you didn't take the cash.

282
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,210
You earned it. And number two,

283
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,820
there are worse things than guilt,girl.

284
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,010
Let me see this. She's cool.

285
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,420
I got ya.

286
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,870
Hey,come here. You like this?

287
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,890
- It would look good on you.
- Really?

288
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,800
It is sweet.

289
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,110
Hey,do you want this?

290
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,790
No,I can't afford it.

291
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,590
No,you don't got to afford it.

292
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,330
You just got to tell me do you want it?

293
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,990
You could have just left them.You
didn't need to ring the doorbell.

294
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:57,350
Yeah,you sure you don't need
help setting these things up?

295
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,640
Ronnie can do it.

296
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,820
I mean,he's... he's not home now.

297
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,390
But he's gonna be home any minute.

298
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,070
I'm not sure he believes me.

299
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,090
There's no lake so...

300
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,030
What do you think?

301
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:18,900
Well,if you saw a beaver
then you saw a beaver.

302
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,590
What's taking so long?

303
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,670
This is delicate business.

304
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,890
You said few minutes.

305
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,590
Well,I like my thumbs.

306
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,150
Your shirt's inside out.

307
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,800
So?

308
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,810
So you gonna leave it like
that or are you gonna fix it?

309
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,370
Are you happy?

310
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,440
Yeah.

311
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,480
It's nice of you to help.

312
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,210
Once an eagle scout
always an eagle scout.

313
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,850
You were never an eagle scout.

314
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:35,730
Clearly I got my
beaver trap merit badge.

315
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,400
- Better concentrate on this.
- Hi,Ron.

316
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,270
Ray just stopped by with some traps.

317
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,660
I thought I said I was
taking care of this.

318
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,210
- I know,but...
- I'm sorry,what is that thing?

319
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,260
This is your standard beaver trap.

320
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,220
It'll take care of your beaver problem.

321
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,900
I don't have a beaver problem.

322
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:01,650
Well,if you did,you
know,it's a clean kill.

323
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,740
Get those death traps off my property.

324
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:06,450
Ronnie,Ray was just trying to help.

325
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,810
What the hell?

326
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,000
You said to dismantle it.
That's how these things work.

327
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,470
Not these traps. These
traps,they're humane.

328
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,950
They do not kill the animal.

329
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,620
If you ever used those things before
you'd know that they malfunction,

330
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,710
misfire,break the beaver's legs.

331
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,040
That's not true.

332
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:27,280
Then you'd have to shoot the beaver
or hit it over the head with a shovel.

333
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,500
I'm going to ask you
one more time nicely,

334
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:34,370
please take those traps
back to your house.

335
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,480
Good luck.

336
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,810
He just showed up.

337
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,020
Lisa,how perfect.

338
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,080
From one chair to another.

339
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,650
Trust me,it's the only way you're
gonna keep your department in line.

340
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,580
Here,pass that down.

341
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,810
You are all so thoughtful.

342
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,610
Thank you. Anyone,more vino? Yes.

343
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,650
Wait,one more.

344
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,950
One more over here. One more.

345
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:14,750
Oh,Tanya.

346
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,510
- What is it?
- Open it.

347
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,190
Oh my goodness.

348
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,770
The pendant is diamond encrusted
and the chain is 18-karat gold.

349
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:27,030
Oh,it's so urban.

350
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,730
I love it.

351
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,510
Tanya,this is a lovely impulse.

352
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:34,170
Well,mom,thank you. I
know it's not your style,

353
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,280
but I thought you'd get a kick out of it

354
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,720
considering how much I paid for it.

355
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,650
The diamonds are real.

356
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,980
Okay,sweetheart.

357
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,470
I mean,I paid a lot,you know?

358
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,510
It's from money I earned at my job.

359
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,440
From your temp job.

360
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:55,280
No. Actually I've started a new business
venture and it's really quite successful.

361
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,380
The fortune cookies?

362
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:00,200
No,mom,that's lyric bread.

363
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,970
And that's not what I'm talking about.

364
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:07,100
This is,um,it's... it's kind of
a new twist on an old industry.

365
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,790
Have I heard of it?

366
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,820
If not yet,then you will.

367
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,910
Our brand recognition among Detroit
women is growing stronger every day.

368
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,410
I recently brought on
our most lucrative client.

369
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,730
Do you have a website?

370
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,440
Actually,Marvin,we don't.

371
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,790
But that's a really interesting idea.

372
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:28,270
Okay,Tanya,you have
to tell us what it is.

373
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,100
When Tanya was 10,

374
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,730
she told me that "The New Yorker"
wanted to publish her haiku.

375
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,330
- I sent it in.
- Darling,you're an adult now.

376
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,390
Why don't you return this? Put
the money towards your rent.

377
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:50,040
Listen,you know,I think
I need some more wine.

378
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,540
We're not going home,I'm
just warning you.

379
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,110
Whenever you're ready.

380
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:02,350
Oh wait,I got it. I got it. I'm paying.

381
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,300
Tanya,there's no need.

382
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:09,110
Let's see...$840,gratuity included.

383
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,570
Tanya,put that away.
You're acting very strange.

384
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,650
- And you're...
- Embarrassing myself?

385
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,080
I'm not embarrassing myself,mom.

386
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,440
I'm proud of myself. I'm passionate.

387
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,290
And for your information,I'm
not a temp anymore.

388
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,700
I've got a new job now and
honestly I'm rolling in it.

389
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,980
And the best part of it
is I'm following my dream.

390
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,810
I'm doing what all you fine
people are afraid to do.

391
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,880
Chair of cinema studies? Bullshit!

392
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,810
Mother,I'm a fucking baller,mom.

393
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:38,590
It's a cute gift. It's very creative.

394
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:45,210
- Is that okay?
- Yeah,so far so good.

395
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,260
Cool.

396
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,100
- How about that?
- Still pretty good.

397
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,910
You know,you can tell me if
something's not working for you.

398
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:04,240
Um,maybe a little less talking.

399
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:07,930
Right. Okay,I can do that.

400
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,810
Come on. Come on.

401
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,150
It's all right. It's okay.

402
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,270
You know what? I'm good.

403
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,980
What?

404
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,920
It's okay.

405
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,880
You don't have to finish.

406
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:39,650
You don't want to?

407
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,120
Sorry,I just...

408
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:44,280
I get kind of bored.

409
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:48,180
Wait,because you're...

410
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,280
you're giving up too easy.

411
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,160
No,seriously,Richard.

412
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,020
It's... everything's...
this happens all the time.

413
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:00,640
Usually I just fake it,but
we can just skip that part.

414
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,840
Okay.

415
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,870
How about...

416
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,220
why don't I go down on you?

417
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,420
That's usually a big hit.

418
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,900
Oh no.

419
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,410
Thanks anyway.

420
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,570
Come on,Liz,you can't just...

421
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,120
Richard,it's fine.

422
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,900
I want to try again. Come on.

423
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,050
You know what? Guys
always want to keep trying.

424
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,240
But I am paying for
it and I want to quit.

425
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,100
I'm a human ice cube.

426
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,140
God,what am I gonna do?

427
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:11,530
- What are you doing here?
- I have concerns,Ray.

428
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,510
You don't trust me anymore.

429
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,710
I never trusted you.

430
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,280
So how'd Liz go?

431
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,120
Oh,it was all right.

432
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:25,710
She's a work in progress.

433
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,430
I don't know.

434
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,770
You'll figure it out.

435
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,800
You're really fucking sexy,Ray.

436
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,350
That's why I'm a fan.

437
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:38,190
I believe in you.

438
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,380
And I believe in your dick.

439
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,000
Don't ever doubt yourself.

440
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,400
It's kind of chilly out here.
Aren't you gonna ask me in?

441
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,580
Come on,we need each other.

442
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,800
Let me in.

443
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:59,360
Jess...

444
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:03,230
if you say there was a beaver
then there's probably a beaver.

445
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,350
Thanks,Ron.

446
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:09,250
It means a lot to me.

447
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,690
His leg is broken.

448
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,600
Oh God.
