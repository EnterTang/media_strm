1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,260
I am in the oldest profession in the world.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,230
<i>Well,I'm about to be.</i>

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,600
<i>Hey,it's been a rough couple of years.</i>

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,740
In high school you were a king.

5
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,640
- What am I now?
- Now you're just hung!

6
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,370
<i>-  Dad,wake up! Dad!
- What?</i>

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,140
You've got insurance,right?

8
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,210
I am still your mother and I am not gonna give up on us.

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,780
Your mom is trying,guys.You know,she wants to be a part of your lives.

10
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,580
<i>- Just fix the house,okay?
- Desperate times call for desperate measures.</i>

11
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,170
<i>Repeat after me: "I'm going to be a millionaire."</i>

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,830
- So you want to get some coffee? - What is your winning tool?

13
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,200
- I've got a big dick,Floyd. - It's so big. Oh my God!

14
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,740
I'm a highly-respected educator.

15
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,440
<i>Nobody can know who I am.</i>

16
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,070
If you want it,I can help.

17
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,110
- You want to be my pimp? - Yeah.

18
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,610
What proof do I have that you're a good pimp,Tanya?

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,710
I have an in. She is the linchpin of our strategy.

20
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,410
These clients of yours, whatever you want them to buy?

21
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,750
My ladies are so loaded, they're recession-proof.

22
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,880
Ray,I put a lot of effort into being your pimp.

23
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,020
Are you ready to be part of my winning team?

24
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,950
You shouldn't be lowering your price in this economy. You should be raising it.

25
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,720
<i>I had lunch with Ray</i>

26
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,720
And he decided that happiness consultants

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,090
Should be run by the three of us.

28
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,490
<i>Ray is my prostitute!</i>

29
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,360
Share Ray or no Ray!

30
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,130
You need a professional-- a sex therapist.

31
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,400
A professional professional?

32
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,740
You'd be surprised at what you could do to avoid another divorce.

33
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,160
Welcome to the majors,Ray.

37
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,270
<i>it's funny how women get in your head.</i>

38
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:52,040
<i>You think you divorced your wife and it's over.</i>

39
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,070
<i>Then suddenly you can't stop wondering why she's unhappy.</i>

40
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,170
<i>She wanted to pay a guy for sex.</i>

41
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,440
<i>And at the last moment I realized</i>

42
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,080
<i>That guy was supposed to be me.</i>

43
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,250
<i>If she loved her husband so much</i>

44
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,650
<i>What was she doing in that hotel?</i>

45
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,790
<i>Having sex for money was a lot harder than I thought.</i>

46
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,630
<i>But I had a house to fix,</i>

47
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,660
<i>Kids who might want to move back in...</i>

48
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,260
<i>A job I used to think was there forever,</i>

49
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,400
<i>But now was only there till the end of spring.</i>

50
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,510
<i>At least there was baseball.</i>

51
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,540
<i>Didn't know why, but I had a feeling</i>

52
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,880
<i>That this year we were gonna win.</i>

53
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,380
<i>Or if we couldn't, we'd go down fighting.</i>

54
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,520
<i>The district might run out of money and hang us out to dry...</i>

55
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,950
<i>But I knew in my gut that if we could just focus on baseball,</i>

56
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,220
<i>I'd be all right.</i>

57
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,790
<i>And the kids would be all right.</i>

58
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,290
<i>Every year is another chance to make it.</i>

59
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,800
<i>Nothing's over till that final out.</i>

60
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,030
<i>Mike: Hey,Ray! I got the signs.</i>

61
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,640
I got some coffee here. You ready to protest?

62
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,140
<i>Stir up a little trouble?</i>

63
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,510
<i>hey,Jess,it's me again.</i>

64
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,410
<i>You haven't called me back, so I hope you're okay.</i>

65
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:37,580
<i>If you're not,or if you are just call me,okay?</i>

66
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,090
<i>We can talk about whatever you want.</i>

67
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,020
<i>Or nothing at all.</i>

68
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,460
no contracts,no school.

69
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,590
Get the facts before you react.

70
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,930
No contracts,no school.

71
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,560
Get the facts before you react.

72
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,500
Hey,I love you.

73
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,470
Jessica!Je-- hey,Jessica.

74
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,800
- Hey,guys,how're you doing? Hey,whoa whoa. - Hi,Ray.

75
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,840
- Hold your horses. Hi. - What do you need,Ray?

76
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,510
- Didn't you get my calls? - Oh,no.

77
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,040
Watch it!Hi.

78
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,110
- Hi. - I was thinking we should have a meeting.

79
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,750
- Oh. - You know,to discuss the kids--

80
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,180
<i>Face to face. Same time,same station?</i>

81
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,790
- How about sundays at Bertson's? - Bertson's is a dump.

82
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,620
What-- you're acting weird,Ray.

83
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,720
<i>I just want to talk to you!</i>

84
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,530
Although we sell dick and not cars,

85
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,460
We can learn a lot from Diego Rivera.

86
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,070
Notice the workers. Clearly their jobs are depressing.

87
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,070
They work too many hours for too little pay

88
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,570
And they have to wear very unattractive overalls.

89
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,340
Actually,Lenore,the workers are meant to be the heroes of this mural.

90
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,970
No,Tanya. When I look with a modern eye,

91
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:48,010
I see someone like Ray teaching history

92
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,540
Year after year to ungrateful ki.

93
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,910
Or maybe that's you,Tanya, at Wagner & Finch

94
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,580
<i>In a washed-out yellow jumpsuit.</i>

95
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,420
Can we get to the point?

96
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:00,620
Glance to the top. You see that doughy asian person

97
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,060
<i>And the mannish woman holding rocks?</i>

98
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,730
That-- those fat people

99
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,590
<i>Could be us.</i>

100
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,460
If we can change our way of operating,

101
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,760
I believe there's a place for us on that mountain.

102
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,490
What about these clenched hands?

103
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,460
To me that represents fisting,Ray.

104
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,000
<i>It tells me it's time for you to change up your repertoire,</i>

105
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,170
<i>Which brings us to Claire. What went wrong?</i>

106
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,570
Nothing. She-- she hugged me goodbye.

107
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,310
<i>She was just a little reserved.</i>

108
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,080
<i>Lenore: What do you mean reserved?</i>

109
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:36,510
<i>I mean she kept most of her clothes on. I guess she was shy?</i>

110
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,810
Well,it's your job to make her relax.

111
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,550
Look,the woman is very pregnant,okay?

112
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,720
<i>- So? - So I had to--</i>

113
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,320
- To-- to go delicate. - Go delicate?

114
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,290
- What does that mean? - You mean...

115
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:52,130
- I mean I held back. - Held back?

116
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,760
- Yes. - I'm still in the dark.

117
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,300
You know,I did just the tip.

118
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,600
You're worried that your dick is so big

119
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,770
- You might hurt the baby? - You don't have to put it like that,Tanya.

120
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,170
That's hilarious.

121
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,710
Look,there's a baby in there.

122
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,770
Babies have been seeing penises for centuries.

123
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,280
Ray,here's the thing: Horny clients with disposable income

124
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,380
Are like fruit-- I can only pick them when they're ripe.

125
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:19,220
Remember the last ripe one? You left her waiting in a hotel room.

126
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,690
<i>- Now she won't take my calls. - I had food poisoning.</i>

127
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,860
It's time for you to prove to me that you are up for this job.

128
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,460
We don't want Claire to have an okay time.

129
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,690
We want her on your hook.

130
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,200
<i>- It's called stripper theory. - You know,Lenore,</i>

131
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:35,600
I've worked with several ex-strippers who are proofreaders now,

132
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,530
And they're pretty miserable people.

133
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,270
You don't know shit about it,t-brain.

134
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,110
Using Ray's penis as a metaphor,

135
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,840
You gotta give her the whole dick.

136
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,580
Not half a dick or a quarter dick,

137
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,040
<i>- Or just the tip. - Tanya: "stripper theory"?</i>

138
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,680
Who does she think she is, a professor?

139
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,750
- PhD of bullshit? - She's a businesswoman.

140
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,280
Just because she says that doesn't mean it's true.

141
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,720
A good businesswoman knows her product,

142
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,590
Which in this case is you.

143
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,560
And she just wanted to lecture. She didn't even think to ask.

144
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:11,760
- Ask what? - If it was difficult for you.

145
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,560
You know? Because she's so pregnant. That was my guess.

146
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,700
It wasn't that difficult,Sherlock Holmes. Where's your car?

147
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,770
Well,I go back-- I go back that way.

148
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,670
okay,um...

149
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,740
- Here's your cut. - My cut?

150
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,610
Wait,Lenore gave you yours? Why didn't she give me mine?

151
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,670
Because she wanted...

152
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,210
Your cut to come out of my cut and I figure why rock the boat?

153
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,350
Are you kidding me? Don't you see the symbolic significance?

154
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,920
It's like saying I'm a charity case.

155
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,800
You should get 60%,Lenore should get 20 and I should get 20.

156
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:49,440
Okay,but for now,Lenore gets 40 and you get 20 of my 60.

157
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,110
Roll it down. Roll it down!

158
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,570
- You got sandwiches? - What?

159
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,540
Where are your sandwiches at? I want a p.B.J.

160
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,340
- Where's your cooler,lady? - Cooler?

161
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,680
- Damn,come on,I want a sandwich. - Ain't you from the mission?

162
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,710
From our lady of Madonna. The mission lady drives this kind of car.

163
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,650
- If you guys are hungry,I could get you a donut. - Donut?!

164
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,150
You think I need a donut? Read the fucking sign,lady.

165
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:29,120
This is the donut hole. Damn,I thought they was related.

166
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,690
- They look so related. - Tanya: Wait wait wait!

167
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,690
Where are you guys going? Shit.

168
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,060
Fuck. I just--

169
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,800
I want--

170
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,770
I-I-I-- I just wanted to ask you some questions about your work.

171
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,370
I'm just interested in your job,but no judgment.

172
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,710
I have no interest in judgment.

173
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,210
Can I help you?

174
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,380
No,I was just leaving.

175
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,360
You looking for work or you looking for play?

176
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,900
Neither. I just wanted to ask some questions

177
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,500
About the psychology of prostitution.

178
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,670
Are you their...

179
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,240
Am I their what?

180
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,370
You know.

181
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,870
Look,lady,

182
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,680
Get the fuck out of here.

183
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,050
<i>Jessica.</i>

184
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,990
<i>It's Lenore,the friend you're not mad at anymore.</i>

185
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,920
<i>Listen,if you want to keep me in the deep freeze,I understand.</i>

186
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,930
<i>But I still need to drop by and give you a full refund.</i>

187
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,490
<i>I insist. I'm morally burdened.</i>

188
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,630
i think Ronnie wants to kill me.

189
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:06,190
Never trust a skin doctor who sleeps with his patients.Full of disease.

190
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,380
And my grandkids are weird.

191
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,210
I know what you're trying to do,mother. It's not working.

192
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,370
Boy is always following the girl.

193
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,960
And girl,masturbates too much.Very loud.

194
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:24,390
I did notice the girl had big muscular fingers.

195
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,820
You know what? We should be grateful.

196
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,060
<i>Most siblings hate each other.</i>

197
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:33,100
And believe me,if there was something wrong With my kids,I'd know it.

198
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,560
If darby wants to masturbate, good for her.

199
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,290
You're telling me that the district has enough money To bus the team to away games,

200
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:45,090
but not enough to drive them back?

201
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,940
How are the players supposed to get back home,Rhonda?

202
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,680
They'll have to work out other means of transportation.

203
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,610
Is this some kind of sick joke?

204
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:55,610
A lot of my kids,they don't have any money. They don't have cars.

205
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:58,350
Their parents are working two, three jobs just to survive.

206
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,350
I don't control the purse strings,Ray.

207
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,690
Don't you have more pressing things to worry about,

208
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,660
Like,I don't know,your job?

209
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,790
<i>This is my job. This is my job.</i>

210
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,960
- Wait,rhonda-- - Rhonda,this is my job.

211
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,160
This is my job. We keep chipping away

212
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,900
At these kids-- no uniforms, no decent field.

213
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,070
And now there's no way to get back from the games?

214
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,870
<i>And these kids-- these kids are good.</i>

215
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,870
Some of them are more than good. Some of them are great.

216
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,940
- Yeah. - We could have a championship team

217
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,310
This year. They just-- they need our support.

218
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,850
They have our support,Ray.

219
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,420
Times are tough.

220
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,190
<i>"times are tough"--</i>

221
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,790
<i>If I never heard that again it would be too soon.</i>

222
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,560
<i>Every piece of ch I got, I put in the house.</i>

223
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,490
<i>It still wasn't finished.</i>

224
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,590
<i>I just had to keep going</i>

225
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,530
<i>One nail at a time.</i>

226
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,110
so,uh,

227
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,640
- Last time... - Yeah.

228
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:13,240
- ...You want it different this time? - Yeah.

229
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,110
- Like harder? - No,not necessarily that.

230
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,720
- No? - No,I...

231
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,120
- Something else? - Yeah,I'm not sure what.

232
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,650
Not sure. You're not sure what.

233
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,020
- I think you were holding back. - Right.

234
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,730
Well,I didn't want to hurt--

235
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,490
No,I mean,like emotionally.

236
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:39,930
Are you somehow like freaked out by me?

237
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,430
No.

238
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,600
I mean,the pregnant aspect of things,that doesn't--

239
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,700
No no,that's cool.

240
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,870
So you really have had sex with a pregnant woman before?

241
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,740
Yeah,a lot.

242
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,840
And did you like it?

243
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,380
Yeah.

244
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,420
A lot?

245
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,150
Yeah.

246
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,160
A lot.

247
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,400
Okay.

248
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,460
Well,that makes me feel better about it.

249
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,200
Maybe it was all in my head.

250
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:28,780
Because in your head it's all clear?

251
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:32,450
It's totally totally clear.

252
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,220
<i>that might be the biggest lie I ever told.</i>

253
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,020
So,darb,

254
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,990
How's it going with hammer?

255
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,830
Bad.

256
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,760
- Why? - He broke up with her again.

257
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,800
- Oh,what happened? - He thinks I'm too fat.

258
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,870
Oh,darb,you are not fat.

259
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,600
Mom,can you not say that, because I don't want to hear it?

260
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,800
And what about you,Damon? What about your romantic life?

261
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,140
<i>oh,what romantic life?</i>

262
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:17,170
Mom,do you mind?

263
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,280
Sure.

264
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:22,280
You know,darb,there are a lot of things I know nothing about.

265
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:25,180
I was a horrible student in high school.

266
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:28,280
I got a d in chemistry. Barely made it through math,

267
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,080
But I-I-I-- I do know about boys.

268
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,650
If there had been a class on boyfriends,

269
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,620
I would have gotten an a+.

270
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,390
All my girlfriends used to come to me and ask me for advice

271
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,290
And they usually ended up with a guy wrapped around their finger.

272
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,860
Do you have Ronnie wrapped around your finger?

273
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,760
Some might say so. All I'm saying is

274
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,730
That I'm pretty good at knowing how to use my feminine wiles.

275
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:55,700
<i>- Gross. - Oh,come on,darb.</i>

276
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,870
Maybe I could be of help to you,you know,with hammer.

277
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:03,010
There are things women could do. Like we could go shopping,

278
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,080
Maybe soften your look a little.

279
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,750
Just think of me as an untapped resource.

280
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:12,120
Thanks,mom. The problem is if I listen to you

281
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:15,490
Then I might end up with your life.

282
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,690
I like my life.

283
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,660
I don't. It's a life lived through men.

284
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,730
You don't really have an existence without them.

285
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,430
What are you talking about? Yes,I do.

286
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,830
I don't even think you like Ronnie that much.

287
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,440
<i>- It's true,mom. - Jessica: That is silly.</i>

288
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,840
- That is so silly,guys. - Oh,but if he left,you'd die,right?

289
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,680
I would not!

290
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:41,140
I would be strong.

291
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:45,180
I would find other things to be interested in.

292
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,220
Like another man?

293
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,720
<i>Not to be mean,mom,</i>

294
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,890
But you just seem like a totally lost person to me.

295
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,270
Here you go,Charlie.

296
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:21,280
I'm a pimp.

297
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,380
I mean,not exactly.

298
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:26,850
Not exactly the kind of pimp you are,but I am a pimp nonetheless.

299
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:29,790
- Are you trying to fuck with me? - It's the God's truth.

300
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,090
But let me assure you, I am tougher than I look.

301
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,460
I mean mentally.

302
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:39,030
Uh,look,you don't have to believe me,

303
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,560
But I need help.

304
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,070
Uh,I've got--

305
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,340
I've got problems,

306
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:50,540
Pimp-type problems.

307
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,410
And I'm new to the business.

308
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,310
How do I get my prostitute to bond with me? Tell me:

309
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,110
Because right now his loyalty is divided.

310
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:05,280
And I need him to be loyal to me,

311
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,350
To respect me.

312
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:13,460
- This a male ho? - Yeah.

313
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,660
What kind of male ho?

314
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:21,130
He's very fresh, very new to the business.

315
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,860
- He does what kind of customer? - Women.

316
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,100
- Just women. - How the hell can he do just women?

317
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,900
- That is not where the money's at. - No,I know.

318
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,600
But I can't even bring up the idea of men.

319
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,270
He's stubborn. He'd quit.

320
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,370
So you have absolutely no control over this ho.

321
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,380
Yeah. Yeah,therein lies the problem.

322
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,480
Although the just-women thing,

323
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,050
It's fine,'cause we're a specialty operation.

324
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,260
You need to get your ho on a tighter leash.

325
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:52,630
And the way that you do that is

326
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,300
You make him want the leash.

327
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,800
- Want the leash? - Uh-huh.

328
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,840
You gotta be there when nobody else is there.

329
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:05,340
You got to know him like nobody knows him.

330
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:08,440
Find out what his problem is and fix it for him.

331
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,350
That's it.

332
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,330
Thank you.

333
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,990
Name's Charlie. And you're welcome.

334
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,660
Ray,I'm too old for this.

335
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,360
Yeah,we should probably stop.

336
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,590
Stop what?

337
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,260
You mean sex?

338
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,960
There's nothing wrong with good healthy sex.

339
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,600
It makes for a fun vibe in the neighborhood.

340
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,500
What are you talking about then?

341
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,970
I'm not in the army anymore. I'm too old to have sex on the floor.

342
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,470
- You were in the army? - Yeah-ha.

343
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,080
The israeli army. You've heard of it?

344
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,820
Hey,Ray?

345
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,500
<i>- Hey,Ray,are you there? -That girl.</i>

346
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,180
It's like she has radar.

347
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,550
Every time we screw, she comes by for a visit.

348
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,590
Why don't you break up with her,Ray?

349
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,920
B-b-because we're not going out.

350
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,150
<i>- Hey,Ray? - Ta-tanya!</i>

351
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,960
hang on.

352
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:07,960
- I'm preoccupied. - I'm leaving out the back.

353
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,490
Get a bed and some carpet in here,Ray.

354
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:13,430
Your floor is giving me scabs. And you call that a skylight?

355
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,500
- You ever heard of hiring a professional? - I'm working on it.

356
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,570
I was cooking and I thought you might be hungry.

357
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:27,810
Plus I figure you can always use a microbrew.

358
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:32,010
- You made burgers? - Yeah.

359
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:34,580
I did!

360
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,850
I like cooking meat.

361
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,850
- With garlic in it? - Yeah,garlic and paprika.

362
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,020
So...

363
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:50,260
You still live in your tent?

364
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,360
Sometimes.

365
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,430
I'm used to it out there,you know?

366
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,830
It's comfortable.

367
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:59,440
So,Ray,

368
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:02,000
I've decided from now on

369
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,510
- I'm not gonna take my commission. - Thank you-- what?!

370
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,580
Since when are you in this business for free?

371
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,910
Since my work stopped being respected.

372
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:16,920
I'm not saying I'm gonna do it for free forever

373
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,820
Just till you see that

374
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,950
I'm a better pimp than Lenore.

375
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,760
And if that day never comes?

376
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,590
Oh,it'll come,Ray. I'm sure of that fact.

377
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,200
So let's talk about Claire. How did that go?

378
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,900
Fine.

379
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,370
I'm pretty damn sure she was happy this time around.

380
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,500
- What about you? - Me? I did what I had to do.

381
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,010
- Well,what's wrong? - Nothing.

382
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,940
Let's just say she's not my favorite job.

383
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,540
- Why? Because she's-- - No no.

384
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,380
Well,what is it then?

385
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:57,120
I don't need my head examined.

386
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,650
All right? It's probably Jessica.

387
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,060
The pregnant lady reminds you

388
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,060
Of Jessica?

389
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:09,090
I used to love--

390
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:16,130
I used to love fucking Jessica when she was pregnant.

391
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,240
I couldn't get enough of it,you know? It's just...

392
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:24,440
I was drunk on it.

393
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:30,610
It was just the future of it all.

394
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:33,820
She's pregnant,

395
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:36,520
We were young.

396
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,430
I try not to think about it when I'm with Claire,but...

397
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:50,260
She reminds me

398
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,230
Of that whole period of time.

399
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:56,570
Maybe--

400
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,770
Maybe you just don't fight it. You know?

401
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:03,070
Maybe you just close your eyes

402
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,380
And pretend that it's--

403
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,410
That it's...

404
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:12,350
Your future,you know?

405
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,080
That it's...

406
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,050
Her.

407
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:22,520
You want me to pretend I'm fucking my ex-wife?

408
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,660
Yeah.

409
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:27,600
You're my pimp and that's your pimp advice?

410
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,900
Yeah.

411
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:32,470
That's my pimp advice.

412
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,940
And right now it's for free.

413
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:43,140
<i>Ray: I ain't gonna lie to you guys.</i>

414
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,110
<i>We've got a lot of problems.</i>

415
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:48,010
Principal barr says we'd be lucky to play any games at all.

416
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,910
We don't have enough equipment.

417
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:52,380
There's no

418
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,480
Money for transport.

419
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,750
Levon can't practice because he's pulling two shifts at the waffle inn.

420
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:02,520
People close to you are out of work,losing their homes.

421
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,930
It doesn't seem like baseball's that important anymore.

422
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,800
When I look at you guys,

423
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:12,300
I don't see a bunch of tired kids. You know what I see?

424
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,600
I see champions.

425
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,210
<i>You've got more talent</i>

426
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,380
<i>And desire in your pinky</i>

427
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,910
Than most teams got in their two hands combined.

428
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:25,320
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna let you go down

429
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:28,650
Without a fight. So right here,

430
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,960
Right now,I pledge

431
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:33,560
<i>I won't let budget</i>

432
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,490
Or money

433
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:38,300
Or any other bullshit adversity stop you.

434
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:40,130
<i>That district can go to hell</i>

435
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:42,430
'cause we're going all the way to the state championships.

436
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,670
Good.

437
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:50,910
<i>Lenore's voice: If you've got an itch,you know where to scratch.</i>

438
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,610
<i>Listen,Lenore,we've had a breakthrough this evening</i>

439
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,280
And I've got a very very good feeling

440
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,810
About Ray's date with Claire.

441
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,910
And I think it's safe to say that I was the deciding factor

442
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:04,310
That turned that situation around. So this is just a heads up

443
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,640
That I do know how to carry my weight in this business.

444
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,610
So,Lenore,to put it another way,

445
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:13,920
<i>I am not a meaningless piece of the pie. I am the pie.</i>

446
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:19,220
* turn the light out, say good night *

447
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,690
* no thinking for a little while *

448
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,490
* let's not try to figure out *

449
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:29,930
* everything at once â™ *

450
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,470
* it's hard to keep track of you  *

451
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,300
* falling through the sky *

452
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,700
* we're half awake *

453
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:42,240
* in a fake empire... *

454
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,290
- I can't stay long. - Yeah,sure,Jess.

455
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,760
You're right,Ray.

456
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:11,390
It's good to find time to talk about the kids.

457
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:14,000
They're teenagers now.

458
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,030
It's hard. It's hard for them.

459
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,870
It's hard for us.

460
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,700
Yeah.

461
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:25,660
I mean,I know that every stage of life has Its challenges.

462
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,870
I don't know what to say to them.

463
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:29,270
Honestly,sometimes I'm at a loss.

464
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,880
Yeah.

465
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,450
Ray?

466
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,650
You brought me here to talk about the kids. You're not saying anything.

467
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,090
I'm yakking away and you're just saying yeah and sure.

468
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,460
Because I'm listening.

469
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:49,430
- What? - Yeah,ed make sure and listen.

470
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,120
You wanted to have this meeting to listen to me talk?

471
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,660
That's right.

472
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:01,050
- About what? - About whatever.

473
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,770
Well,that's strange,Ray.

474
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:10,200
You don't like it-- me listening to you?

475
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,360
It's just I...

00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:15,180
- What? - Where did you get that idea?

477
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,450
- And why did you pick this place? - Do you want to bowl?

478
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,770
- What? - Let's bowl.

479
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,390
- Now? - Yeah.

480
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:25,000
I can't. I can't bowl with you anymore.

481
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,500
I'm married.

482
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:30,930
I'm not asking you to fuck,Jess.

483
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,070
I'm asking you to bowl.

484
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,860
- It's a complicated request. - No.

485
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,270
It's simple.

486
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,850
Turn this one out. Over the line.

487
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:21,940
Nice!

488
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:28,560
