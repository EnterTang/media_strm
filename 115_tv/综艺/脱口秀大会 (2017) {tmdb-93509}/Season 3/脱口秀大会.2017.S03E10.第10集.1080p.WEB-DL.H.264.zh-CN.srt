<i>Air and naval
forces of the United States</i>

3
00:00:06,941 --> 00:00:09,141
<i>Pan Am flight 103 crashed

4
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:10,443
<i>He has sanctioned

5

6
00:00:12,947 --> 00:00:15,548
<i>This will not stand, this
aggression against, uh, Kuwait.</i>

7
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,450
<i>This relentless
pursuit of terror.</i>

8
00:00:17,452 --> 00:00:19,285
<i>We will make no distinction...</i>

9
00:00:19,287 --> 00:00:21,120
<i>The USS</i> Cole <i>was attacked</i>

10
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:21,988
<i>while refueling in</i>
<i>the port of Aden.</i>

11
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,956
This was an act of terrorism.

12
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:26,325
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

13
00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:28,895
<i>The next samba</i>
<i>we're going to swing for you</i>

14

favorites.

15
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:32,465
...until something stops him.

16
00:00:32,467 --> 00:00:35,301
<i>It was right</i>
<i>in front of my eyes,</i>

17

<i>and I never saw it coming.</i>

18
00:00:36,838 --> 00:00:40,039
<i>That plane crashed</i>
<i>into the World Trade Center.</i>

00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:42,475
<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

20
00:00:42,477 --> 00:00:46,646
We must and we will remain
vigilant at home and abroad.

21
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:54,687
<i>You're the smartest</i>
<i>and the dumbest fucking person</i>

23
00:00:56,691 --> 00:00:58,357
<i>I'm not the

24
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:00,660
<i>I'm the only one</i>
<i>who got it right.</i>

00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:06,232
<i>Take 'em.</i>

Homeland - 3x10

<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

29
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:23,449
The bomber's the only way
to prove that Brody's innocent.

30
00:01:23,451 --> 00:01:25,284
What the fuck
are you doing, Carrie?

31
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:28,087
Carrie, turn around now.

32
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:30,890
This is your last warning.

33
00:01:33,695 --> 00:01:36,195
<i>We got a gunshot wound
to the upper left bicep.</i>

34
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:38,064
Significant bleeding.
Might have clipped an artery.

35
00:01:38,066 --> 00:01:39,765
Where the fuck is Saul?

36
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:47,440
<i>He's not what we expected.</i>

37
00:01:47,442 --> 00:01:49,542
<i>But he's what we've got.</i>

38
00:01:49,544 --> 00:01:51,277
<i>The guy's a junkie... sir.</i>

39
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:53,980
I'm offering you the chance
to be a Marine again.

40
00:01:53,982 --> 00:01:55,982
No more. I...

41
00:01:55,984 --> 00:01:57,883
I'm done.

42
00:01:57,885 --> 00:01:59,318
I have a play.

43
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,120
It involves Brody.

44
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:03,889
- You told me Javadi was the play.
- He is.

45
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:05,558
Brody's the next phase.

46
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,593
So, what is it?
What's your big idea?

47
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:08,794
Darnish Akbari.

48
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:10,730
Head of Iran's
Revolutionary Guard.

49
00:02:10,732 --> 00:02:11,964
Right.

50
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:13,733
Javadi's boss.

51
00:02:13,735 --> 00:02:16,135
And the single greatest
impediment to peace.

52
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:17,903
I want him gone.

53
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:19,005
Brody can get to him.

54
00:02:19,007 --> 00:02:20,740
Do what Saul's asking.

55
00:02:20,742 --> 00:02:21,574
What you're asking.

56
00:02:21,576 --> 00:02:23,009
All right, what I'm asking.

57
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:24,810
Look at me, Carrie.

58
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:27,279
<i>You couldn't send me out for</i>
<i>a pack of cigarettes right now.</i>

59
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:29,415
<i>We'll get you ready.</i>

60
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:31,150
<i>You just have to be willing.</i>

61
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:33,753
<i>The guys get me to the border</i>

62
00:02:33,755 --> 00:02:35,154
where I surrender myself?

63
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:36,689
Correct, and we chose

64
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:39,291
Marivan, because
several Al Qaeda commanders

65
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:40,926
also asked
for political asylum there.

66
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:42,995
What make you think
I'll ever get close enough

67
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:44,430
to General Akbari
to take him out?

68
00:02:44,432 --> 00:02:45,698
Javadi's on the ground.

69
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,466
We'll facilitate a meeting
between the two of you.

70
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:49,301
<i>I will come back from Tehran.</i>

71
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:51,270
<i>I know you will.</i>

72
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:52,938
<i>And not just for her.</i>

73
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,611
Brody?

74
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,516
See you on the other side.

75
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,469
Carrie.

76
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:26,806
We need to talk.

77
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:28,074
What about?

78
00:03:28,076 --> 00:03:29,809
How's your shoulder?

79
00:03:29,811 --> 00:03:31,210
Brand fucking new.

80
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:32,878
I want to clear the air

81
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,014
after that clusterfuck
with Franklin at the motel.

82
00:03:35,016 --> 00:03:36,182
I'm not interested.

83
00:03:36,184 --> 00:03:37,650
I'm so tired of
all the bullshit

84
00:03:37,652 --> 00:03:40,152
and people covering their asses,
I can't even tell you.

85
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:41,487
It was a direct order, Carrie.

86
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:44,156
I didn't want to risk letting
someone else take the shot.

87
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:56,368
While you were in surgery,

88
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,004
I took a look
at your medical records.

89
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:01,373
You what?!

90
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:05,010
I was worried
about the damage I'd done.

91
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:09,348
Carrie, you're
15 weeks pregnant.

92
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,784
- So?
- So, I think

93
00:04:11,786 --> 00:04:14,386
you should consider sitting
this part of the operation out.

94
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:15,921
And why would I do that?

95
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:18,090
Because it's impossible
for you to be objective

96
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,625
under the circumstances.

97
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:22,027
The circumstances being,
I'm carrying Brody's child?

98
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,863
Yes.

99
00:04:23,865 --> 00:04:26,766
Well, first of all,
it's not his,

100
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:28,234
thank you very much.
Second of all,

101
00:04:28,236 --> 00:04:29,368
it's none of your
damn business,

102
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,703
or anyone else's,

103
00:04:30,705 --> 00:04:32,638
so just stay the fuck
out of my way.

104
00:04:35,385 --> 00:04:38,796
_

105
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,491
Medium rare?

106
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,896
Hmm.

107
00:04:56,898 --> 00:04:59,098
Pretty fucking tasty, huh?

108
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,567
Hmm... hmm. Yeah.

109
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:05,004
The secret is to relax the goat

110
00:05:05,006 --> 00:05:06,839
before you cut his throat.

111
00:05:06,841 --> 00:05:09,408
Which is why Modarres
has lockjaw and sore knees.

112
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,530
- How are they doing?
- Mm.

113
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:34,800
Good. That move across
Kurdistan was uneventful.

114
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:36,101
Now...

115
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:39,471
that's them right there. They're waiting
for nightfall, at which point,

116
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:40,940
they'll drive him
right up to the border

117
00:05:40,942 --> 00:05:43,375
here, cover him across
to the manned checkpoint

118
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:45,845
on the Iranian side,
right there.

119
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,351
<i>The risk</i>
<i>of an international incident</i>

120
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:54,486
is a serious concern
for the President.

121
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:58,891
We stand 100%
behind what we told him.

122
00:05:58,893 --> 00:06:01,794
The risk of this operation
is worth the reward.

123
00:06:01,796 --> 00:06:04,296
And in the unlikely event
anything goes wrong,

124
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:06,065
we have it covered.

125
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:09,969
I'm not even going to
ask what that means.

126
00:06:09,971 --> 00:06:11,370
All he has to do tonight

127
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:14,073
is walk across the border
and ask for asylum.

128
00:06:14,075 --> 00:06:16,542
That's it.

129
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,849
Is that a Marine thing?

130
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:27,653
Turn the socks inside out,
get the fresh side.

131
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:29,989
Well, there is no fresh side.

132
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:32,524
One side's sweaty,
and the other's just dirty.

133
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:35,728
Well, maybe it's just
all in my head.

134
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,998
Does it work?

135
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,333
Well, look at me.

136
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:43,269
I'm a new man.

137
00:06:43,271 --> 00:06:44,670
Comms check.

138
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:58,918
Kilo-Alpha, this is Zero.

139
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,386
We have visual.

140
00:07:00,388 --> 00:07:02,288
Send signal strength. Over.

141
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,023
Kilo-Alpha.

142
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:05,691
Signal strength ten.

143
00:07:05,693 --> 00:07:08,594
Kilo-Bravo,
this is Zero. Over.

144
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:10,029
Bravo. Also strength ten.

145
00:07:10,031 --> 00:07:11,997
Zero, this is Kilo-Alpha.

146
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,301
New Moon, visibility good.

147
00:07:15,303 --> 00:07:17,603
Another day in paradise.

148
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:19,305
How's the passenger doing?

149
00:07:19,307 --> 00:07:21,540
Not bad.

150
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:24,276
For a fucking jarhead.

151
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:27,046
That is all. Alpha out.

152
00:07:27,048 --> 00:07:28,781
Bravo out.

153
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,886
What's he walking into
at the border crossing point?

154
00:07:33,888 --> 00:07:36,088
Hey, Gene, can you bring up
the border photos, please?

155
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,623
Coming up.

156
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,760
Yeah, as of two hours ago,

157
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:44,296
one barrack hut for eight men,
commanded by a sergeant.

158
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:46,732
Roadside guard hut manned
in four-hour shifts

159
00:07:46,734 --> 00:07:49,168
by two men with
automatic weapons.

160
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,636
Any updates on the Iranian

161
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:52,271
border patrol radio traffic?

162
00:07:52,273 --> 00:07:53,639
Hourly comms checks.

163
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:55,407
Plus, one request
for more ration packs,

164
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:57,009
two for new radio batteries.

165
00:07:57,011 --> 00:07:58,577
Eight bored
and hungry conscripts

166
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:00,479
whose radios we're dialed into.

167
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:02,982
No chance of
underestimating them then?

168
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,118
Fair point.

169
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,954
Let's go over your cover story

170
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:10,990
one last time.

171
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:17,029
After the bombing,

172
00:08:17,031 --> 00:08:19,932
Nazir's network left a car
near Langley,

173
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:22,601
which I took into the woods
on the Canadian border,

174
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:24,937
where I shaved my head,
and I continued on foot.

175
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:26,939
There I stole a boat
across the Bay Of Fundy

176
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:28,941
to Nova Scotia,
where I met a guy

177
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:30,776
who had ties with Amer El-Maati,

178
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:33,212
who put me in a shipping
container to Colombia.

179
00:08:33,214 --> 00:08:34,279
Mm-hmm.

180
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:36,048
Then, mercenaries
working with Hezbollah

181
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,550
took me across to Venezuela,
where they finally put me

182
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:40,119
into a state oil company plane

183
00:08:40,121 --> 00:08:41,286
to a strip in Iraq,

184
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:43,622
where I was handed over
to an Al Qaeda cell

185
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:46,925
who were tasked with getting me
across the border to Iran.

186
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:52,197
Join Al Qaeda, see the world.

187
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,902
Final checks. Night vision.

188
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,608
Night vision transmissions
coming online.

189
00:09:26,534 --> 00:09:28,033
I'm out of Black Jack.

190
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:30,069
Any more out there?

191
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,341
Everything okay, sir?

192
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:37,676
This the last pack?

193
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:39,244
I got you plenty more.

194
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,246
Don't worry.

195
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,658
Did you write a letter?

196
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,394
What?

197
00:09:55,396 --> 00:09:57,029
Home.

198
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:59,364
To say good-bye.

199
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:04,803
Pretty sure you guys
would know if I did.

200
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:06,872
You could've arranged it

201
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:10,876
with your, uh, CIA friend,
the blonde.

202
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,724
How you doing?

203
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:27,259
Good. You?

204
00:10:27,261 --> 00:10:30,395
Feel like I'm in Vegas
betting the mortgage.

205
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:32,397
Stand by, people.

206
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,899
Show time.

207
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:36,401
What's going on with Reaper 1?

208
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:38,504
Sensor bandwidth issues.

209
00:10:38,506 --> 00:10:40,205
It happens.
We're resetting.

210
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:45,611
All being well, shouldn't
be more than a couple minutes.

211
00:10:45,613 --> 00:10:46,845
"All being well"?

212
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,080
Are we holding the team back

213
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:49,515
until the drone's back on line?

214
00:10:49,517 --> 00:10:50,616
That drone's mainly for us.

215
00:10:50,618 --> 00:10:51,950
They have satphones
and night vision.

216
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:55,420
They can move closer to the
border without it for now.

217
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,687
- Shit.
- What?

218
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:37,856
Road to the border's
as good as blocked.

219
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:41,893
Foreign gas trucks paying off
local officials with free gas.

220
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:45,097
Cops, military, you name it,
all on the take.

221
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,233
Where's the border?

222
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:50,102
Another mile past 'em
on this same road.

223
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:52,371
Those lights in the distance.

224
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:57,743
Zero, Kilo-Alpha, over.

225
00:12:57,745 --> 00:12:58,877
Zero send, over.

226
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,445
See what I'm seeing?

227
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:03,181
Yeah. Wait out.

228
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,419
Guys, get out.

229
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:10,956
Make it look like car trouble
for anybody passing.

230
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,464
We have a backup plan, right?

231
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:23,468
Yeah. We're waiting for Langley
to confirm the alternate route.

232
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,739
Now, I need that drone.
Are we gonna have it or not?

233
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:29,374
Copy that.

234
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,684
What's taking them so long?

235
00:13:38,686 --> 00:13:42,254
I don't know. They had
a technical with the drone.

236
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:45,857
So how long are we gonna
sit here for?

237
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:48,360
Shit, man,
you're worse than my kids.

238
00:13:48,362 --> 00:13:51,096
God, those rear echelon
motherfuckers.

239
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:53,098
Got a problem with the drone.

240
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,567
That's a good start.

241
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:58,937
Reaper's back.

242
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:01,340
Good.

243
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:03,608
Now let's get eyes

244
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,844
on that alternate
route into the border.

245
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:07,713
Repositioning now.

246
00:14:07,715 --> 00:14:09,114
Kilo-Alpha, Zero.

247
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:11,183
Drone is back online.
Scouting your route.

248
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:13,385
Wait out.

249
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:18,123
Back to chewing
your lucky gum again?

250
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,359
Yeah. You want a stick?

251
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:39,478
Shit.

252
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,085
Put your head down.

253
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:49,488
Like you're sleeping.
Don't move.

254
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:58,563
Zero, Kilo-Bravo. Stand by.

255
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,332
May have a situation
with the Alpha vehicle.

256
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:02,401
Local cops just rolled up.

257
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:13,044
Maghreb.

258
00:15:14,515 --> 00:15:16,014
Why are you here?

259
00:15:17,451 --> 00:15:19,584
Going to Marivan.

260
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:34,866
...Al Qaeda.

261
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:38,136
They're not
buying the cover story.

262
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,509
Jesus, they want to look
in the truck.

263
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,316
Say the word,
Kilo-Alpha.

264
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:53,885
- What word?
- "Good night."

265
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:57,622
They should say "Good night"
before the cops see Brody.

266
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,634
<i>As-salamu alaykum.</i>

267
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,471
Good... night.

268
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:14,699
Hey...

269
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,201
You okay?

270
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,405
Brody? You good?

271
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:28,079
Hey.

272
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:43,061
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I can't do it.

273
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:44,496
- Yes, you can.
- I can't. No.

274
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:46,364
- I can't. No, I fucking can't.
- And you will.

275
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:48,333
I fucking can't. I fucking...

276
00:17:48,335 --> 00:17:50,835
Bit late in the day
for your vagina to chime in.

277
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:52,837
Fuck off...

278
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:57,842
You scared?

279
00:17:57,844 --> 00:18:00,078
Are you fucking scared?

280
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,181
Mm-hmm. Mmm. I'm...

281
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:05,717
- I'm scared. I'm scared.
- Good.

282
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:08,386
Me, too. I've seen
way too many men

283
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:10,021
killed out here in this
third world toilet.

284
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:12,524
I personally shit myself every
time they send me back here.

285
00:18:12,526 --> 00:18:15,060
And if you don't snap out
of this right now

286
00:18:15,062 --> 00:18:17,028
we could all fucking die
here tonight.

287
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,930
Is that what you want?

288
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,865
No.

289
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:23,535
Tell me you're gonna be okay.

290
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:27,238
Tell me that this is not
the end of the road for you.

291
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:33,478
No, no, no...
I need to hear you say it.

292
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,580
I'll be...

293
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:38,416
I will be okay. I'm okay.

294
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:40,819
I'm okay.

295
00:18:40,821 --> 00:18:42,821
I'll be okay.

296
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:53,632
Kilo-Alpha, is there a problem?

297
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,471
Passenger got carsick.
He threw up

298
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:00,939
and we're ready to roll.

299
00:19:00,941 --> 00:19:02,340
Carsick?

300
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:04,409
It's a secure sat link.
Can you tell them to just

301
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:06,978
- cut the bullshit?
- Is he gonna be okay?

302
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,481
Fuckin'-A he's gonna be okay.

303
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,252
Here.

304
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:15,920
Wipe the blood off your face.

305
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:17,789
Kilo-Alpha,

306
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:20,992
Kilo-Bravo, proceed
to alternate crossing point.

307
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:22,994
Roger.

308
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,696
Alpha out.

309
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:38,043
Did we or did we not just kill
three Iraqi police officers?

310
00:19:38,045 --> 00:19:40,211
Kurdish-- not to split hairs.

311
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:44,683
Either way, this isn't something
the President needs to know.

312
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:46,951
Oh, I understand.
Believe me.

313
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,789
Get me JSOC Commander now.

314
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:20,351
This whole area is
pretty much a no-man's land

315
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:22,487
since the Iran-Iraq war.

316
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:24,389
We got visitors.

317
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,501
- Senator. General.
- Director.

318
00:20:36,503 --> 00:20:37,902
- The White House...
- I know.

319
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:39,704
- I was told you were coming.
- Let me finish.

320
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:41,740
The White House sent
General Pfister and me

321
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:43,108
to advise and observe.

322
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,710
Advise and observe.

323
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:48,847
The JSOC Commander, to advise;
myself, the President's nomin...

324
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:50,749
What did Higgins tell you
about the operation?

325
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:55,620
That this part was meant to be
quick and silent and bloodless.

326
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:57,355
He told you everything,
didn't he?

327
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:58,790
Yes, he did.

328
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:01,359
- Including...?
- Sergeant Brody, yes.

329
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,728
Saul...

330
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,630
whatever this turns out to be,

331
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:08,032
bold stroke of genius
or otherwise,

332
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:10,135
I'm destined to inherit it.

333
00:21:10,137 --> 00:21:12,036
So now that it's actually
in motion,

334
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:13,705
for better or for worse,

335
00:21:13,707 --> 00:21:17,342
I have no choice
but to wish it every success.

336
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,148
A word in private, Senator?

337
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,883
Excuse us, Bill.

338
00:21:24,885 --> 00:21:26,017
Of course.

339
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:39,731
What about the breathing room
you agreed to give me?

340
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:42,767
The deal was that I delay
my confirmation hearing,

341
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:43,735
which I've done.

342
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:45,737
That obligation
has been fulfilled.

343
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:48,106
Consider yourself lucky, Saul,

344
00:21:48,108 --> 00:21:50,675
that Higgins called us
and not the President

345
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:53,812
or his National
Security Advisor.

346
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,918
Copy that.

347
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,886
Copy.

348
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,990
- Ms. Mathison.
- Senator.

349
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:08,326
How's your shoulder?

350
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:11,196
Doctor told me you
were very lucky.

351
00:22:11,198 --> 00:22:13,598
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

352
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,169
All I can say is you must be
one hell of a salesperson

353
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,004
to get Brody to do this.

354
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:24,409
Here at the Agency,
we call that recruiting.

355
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:36,588
Here. Take a look.

356
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,124
Border's a click
and a half away.

357
00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:42,460
300 yards past that building.

358
00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:45,630
All it is is a shallow stream,
12 yards across.

359
00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:48,366
Listen... I'm gonna
drive you right up to it

360
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:49,734
and we're all gonna
be watching you.

361
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:54,472
You way across that river and you head
up to that treeline on the other side.

362
00:22:54,474 --> 00:22:56,641
Once you hit it, follow
it north for three miles

363
00:22:56,643 --> 00:22:57,809
back to the Iranian checkpoint

364
00:22:57,811 --> 00:23:00,044
where we were
originally gonna drop you.

365
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:05,016
Hey, where you going?

366
00:23:05,018 --> 00:23:06,484
Piss.

367
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:08,720
Go with him.

368
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:13,157
We got potential bogeys.

369
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:14,826
Two Iraqi army hummers

370
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:17,362
three clicks south
of our call sign.

371
00:23:17,364 --> 00:23:20,198
Kilo-Alpha, we have
two Iraqi hummers

372
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,736
three clicks south, it's not a
significant threat but be aware.

373
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:26,337
Alpha Roger.

374
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:29,173
All right, we got an Iraqi
patrol three clicks south.

375
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:32,343
It's not that big a deal but
it's difficult terrain out there

376
00:23:32,345 --> 00:23:33,845
so we got to move quick, quiet

377
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:36,681
and small now, which means
it's just me and him from here.

378
00:23:36,683 --> 00:23:39,384
Rest of you guys stay here,
cover from this position.

379
00:23:39,386 --> 00:23:41,085
Questions?

380
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:46,758
Ready?

381
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,594
Yeah.

382
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,813
When you were a little kid,
what did you want to be when you grew up?

383
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:12,050
I don't remember.

384
00:24:12,052 --> 00:24:13,151
Bullshit.

385
00:24:13,153 --> 00:24:15,119
Everyone remembers.

386
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:21,826
You don't
have to manage me anymore, man.

387
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:23,828
I know what I'm here to do.

388
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:26,798
Just making conversation's all.

389
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:29,801
What's that?

390
00:24:31,771 --> 00:24:33,237
Nothing.

391
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:45,016
Well, what did you want to be?

392
00:24:45,018 --> 00:24:46,484
I grew up in Texas.

393
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:48,820
All I wanted to do
was ride bulls.

394
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:50,488
Yeah, why didn't you?

395
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,622
I did.

396
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:53,591
Two years.

397
00:24:53,593 --> 00:24:55,593
But my nuts couldn't
take the beating.

398
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,298
So now I do this.

399
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,466
Happy fucking...

400
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,018
What just happened?

401
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,755
Kilo-Alpha,
this is Zero, over.

402
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:29,694
Kilo-Alpha, this is Zero, over.

403
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,231
Kilo-Alpha, Zero, over.

404
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:37,802
Zero, this is Kilo-Bravo.

405
00:25:37,804 --> 00:25:39,404
Alpha hit something.

406
00:25:39,406 --> 00:25:41,239
A mine or an IED.

407
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:44,976
Any hostiles on your screens?

408
00:25:44,978 --> 00:25:46,611
Stand by. Checking now.

409
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:51,115
Nothing, so far.

410
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,160
Sir, that Iraqi patrol

411
00:26:02,162 --> 00:26:04,262
just turned north,
towards the explosion.

412
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:08,499
Now we have to call
the President.

413
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:10,735
Wait.
Let the dust settle first.

414
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:12,837
No, any possibility of
an international incident

415
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:15,373
- I must call the President.
- What you must do

416
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:16,841
is keep a cool head

417
00:26:16,843 --> 00:26:18,843
and take great care
not to panic.

418
00:26:18,845 --> 00:26:21,045
Well, we at least have
to call the Iraqis.

419
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:22,213
And say what?

420
00:26:22,215 --> 00:26:24,248
Turn your patrol around,
we have a CIA team

421
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,584
we didn't tell you about,
operating in the area?

422
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:34,859
That drone is armed, correct?

423
00:26:34,861 --> 00:26:35,860
Zero, Kilo-Bravo.

424
00:26:35,862 --> 00:26:37,929
We're one click out
from Kilo-Alpha.

425
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:40,064
Roger, Kilo-Bravo, be advised

426
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:42,733
that Iraqi patrol is closing
on your position.

427
00:26:42,735 --> 00:26:46,771
Sir, White House
is on the line.

428
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,208
Put him on the screen.

429
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,742
Mike.

430
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:54,245
- I may have a solution.
- Please.

431
00:26:54,247 --> 00:26:57,882
That drone has four
Hellfire missiles on it.

432
00:26:57,884 --> 00:27:00,084
You saying we engage
the Iraqi patrol?

433
00:27:00,086 --> 00:27:03,154
I'm saying we just found
an Al Qaeda cell

434
00:27:03,156 --> 00:27:06,657
trying to smuggle America's most
wanted terrorist into Iran

435
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:08,926
and we take them out
with that drone.

436
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,794
Jesus.

437
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:12,230
It's a smart play
if they're dead.

438
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:18,002
- And if they're not dead? - He doesn't
care whether they're dead or alive,

439
00:27:18,004 --> 00:27:21,139
all he fucking gives a shit
about is covering his own ass.

440
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:23,407
- Bite your lip, Carrie. Bite it hard.
- Fuck.

441
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:28,312
That Iraqi patrol is,
what, a minute away?

442
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:32,150
Let me be very clear, Mike.

443
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:37,155
I will not order
a strike on our own men.

444
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,992
Hang it up.

445
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:45,997
We've got movement
in the Alpha vehicle.

446
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,227
Either the vehicle just settled

447
00:28:16,229 --> 00:28:18,729
or I have a second
heat signature moving.

448
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:28,839
The second figure is moving.

449
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:31,375
They're alive;
they're both alive.

450
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:49,994
My leg.

451
00:28:49,996 --> 00:28:52,063
Motherfucker...

452
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:55,266
No.

453
00:28:56,602 --> 00:28:58,703
- My fucking leg...
- All right, sit up.

454
00:28:58,705 --> 00:29:01,339
Sit up, sit up.

455
00:29:01,341 --> 00:29:02,707
Fold your arms.

456
00:29:02,709 --> 00:29:05,543
Okay, come with me.

457
00:29:05,545 --> 00:29:07,745
All right...

458
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,121
Phone, satphone.

459
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:25,296
- Kilo-Bravo, this is Alpha, over.
- Bravo, send.

460
00:29:25,298 --> 00:29:28,266
We're in the building
to the west of the border,

461
00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:30,534
no enemy fire;
casualty is still conscious

462
00:29:30,536 --> 00:29:32,536
but he's lost a leg
and a lot of blood, over.

463
00:29:32,538 --> 00:29:35,239
Bravo, Roger.
Your location 60 seconds, over.

464
00:29:35,241 --> 00:29:37,642
Get a gun team
up on high ground.

465
00:29:37,644 --> 00:29:41,078
I can treat for shock
and stem the blood flow for now.

466
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:45,249
Take your time to follow
our exact route in, over.

467
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:47,285
On it. Out.

468
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,069
Focus on your kids.

469
00:30:05,071 --> 00:30:07,271
I don't have any kids, dumbass.

470
00:30:07,273 --> 00:30:11,676
Making small talk 'cause
you were being a fucking baby.

471
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,314
We're gonna get you out of here.

472
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,762
Smoke.

473
00:30:31,764 --> 00:30:34,432
Here, give me some
of my cigarettes.

474
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:48,813
I never thought I'd
be this fucking guy.

475
00:30:48,815 --> 00:30:51,015
No, me neither.

476
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:56,854
I guess I fucked up, T.

477
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:59,123
Beers on you, then.

478
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:00,491
I gave him one morphine shot.

479
00:31:00,493 --> 00:31:01,492
He's got one left.

480
00:31:01,494 --> 00:31:02,827
We got to haul ass now.

481
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:05,296
Grab that.

482
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,469
Here. Here... here.

483
00:31:11,471 --> 00:31:13,971
Roll... back.

484
00:31:13,973 --> 00:31:15,306
Okay.

485
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:19,009
- Ready to do this, boss?
- Yeah.

486
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:21,846
All right, everybody
back to the truck.

487
00:31:21,848 --> 00:31:23,414
- Go!
- Let's go, quick.

488
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:30,955
Iraqi patrol
just joined the party.

489
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:46,437
Zero, Kilo-Bravo, contact!
Automatic fire from the south.

490
00:31:46,439 --> 00:31:48,105
Platoon or possible
company strength.

491
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,380
Do all you can
not to escalate this.

492
00:31:56,382 --> 00:31:59,049
Suppressive return fire.
Suppressive fire only.

493
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:01,385
Don't put them in the ground.
Just turn them around.

494
00:32:01,387 --> 00:32:04,722
Zero, Kilo-Bravo,
we don't get Aziz out

495
00:32:04,724 --> 00:32:07,458
- in the next few minutes, he's dead.
- Iraqi call signs

496
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,927
are requesting an artillery fire
mission up the chain.

497
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:11,595
How far out are
our helicopters?

498
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:13,798
Eight minutes.

499
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,199
General, advice?

500
00:32:15,201 --> 00:32:16,801
Eight minutes
is time we don't have.

501
00:32:16,803 --> 00:32:19,370
- Either we call the Iraqis and level with
them... - Also time we don't have

502
00:32:19,372 --> 00:32:21,071
and every shade of blowback
we can't afford.

503
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:24,041
So it's a fighting withdrawal
to a secure LZ,

504
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:26,944
back five clicks in the vehicle
that they have left.

505
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,651
In other words,
we have to abort.

506
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,891
The intelligence
operation is over.

507
00:32:40,893 --> 00:32:43,093
It's a military one now.
It's all yours, General.

508
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:44,395
Thank you, sir.

509
00:32:44,397 --> 00:32:45,729
Shoot the boys out of there.

510
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:47,231
Copy that. Comms.

511
00:32:57,843 --> 00:32:59,643
Kilo Bravo, this is Zero-Alpha.

512
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:01,145
Bravo, send.

513
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:04,248
- We're going to push them back
with Hellfire, over. - Roger.

514
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,817
Withdraw with Hellfire
in support on your command.

515
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:08,419
On my command, roger, wait.

516
00:33:08,421 --> 00:33:11,355
Are they aborting the mission?

517
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,094
Saul.

518
00:33:18,964 --> 00:33:21,499
You had some bad luck.

519
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:23,100
I'm sorry.

520
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:29,573
Hey.

521
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:31,675
At least we have Javadi.

522
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:34,512
He's still in play.
That's not nothing.

523
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:37,348
Yeah.

524
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:01,805
Stand by for Hellfire
mission, over.

525
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:02,806
You guys ready?

526
00:34:04,644 --> 00:34:06,911
Fall back! Fall back!

527
00:34:06,913 --> 00:34:10,481
- I'm not gonna go back. - What the fuck
are you talking about? Yeah, you are.

528
00:34:10,483 --> 00:34:12,816
I'm gonna walk across that border into
Iran and you're not gonna to stop...

529
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:16,186
Listen to me! I am fucking ordering
you to fucking move out!

530
00:34:20,826 --> 00:34:22,159
Passenger refuses to withdraw,

531
00:34:22,161 --> 00:34:24,662
and I'm out of time.
Please advise.

532
00:34:24,664 --> 00:34:26,830
Do not leave anyone behind.

533
00:34:26,832 --> 00:34:28,399
We are under heavy fire!

534
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:30,501
The casualty is priority one,

535
00:34:30,503 --> 00:34:32,236
and the passenger is
non-fucking-compliant!

536
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,509
General, please advise!

537
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:40,344
Let me talk to him.

538
00:34:40,346 --> 00:34:43,113
If anyone can talk Brody
down off a ledge, she can.

539
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:47,117
All right.

540
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:52,222
Put the passenger on the line.

541
00:34:52,224 --> 00:34:54,959
I say again,
put the passenger on the line.

542
00:34:54,961 --> 00:34:57,361
Take this.

543
00:34:57,363 --> 00:35:00,130
Take it!

544
00:35:00,132 --> 00:35:02,032
Brody?

545
00:35:02,034 --> 00:35:03,367
Brody?

546
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:06,036
Brody, can you hear me?

547
00:35:06,038 --> 00:35:09,873
- Hey, Brody! - They're trying
to abort the mission, Carrie!

548
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:12,876
- I know.
- Well, tell them to go fuck themselves.

549
00:35:12,878 --> 00:35:14,044
No, listen to me.

550
00:35:14,046 --> 00:35:16,380
You can't do this by yourself.

551
00:35:16,382 --> 00:35:18,549
I'm 300 yards
from the border, Carrie.

552
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:20,384
I can make it.

553
00:35:20,386 --> 00:35:22,920
You cross into Iran now and you will
be completely on your own.

554
00:35:22,922 --> 00:35:25,489
Well, to be honest I don't see
much of an option here.

555
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:27,558
The option is
to fall back, regroup,

556
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,593
and we'll take another shot
at this later.

557
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:32,997
Come on, Carrie, you know
that's not gonna happen.

558
00:35:32,999 --> 00:35:35,799
You don't know that!

559
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:37,801
Now, stop and think
this through.

560
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:40,137
You have no sanction,
no support on the ground,

561
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:42,339
and no extraction plan.

562
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:46,910
You will die over there!

563
00:35:46,912 --> 00:35:48,412
No, you're wrong, Carrie.

564
00:35:50,016 --> 00:35:52,082
And you want to know why?

565
00:35:52,084 --> 00:35:53,484
'Cause you're gonna get me home.

566
00:35:53,486 --> 00:35:55,753
No, don't say that!
Do not put that on me.

567
00:35:55,755 --> 00:35:56,920
It's a fantasy.

568
00:35:56,922 --> 00:35:58,122
You'll find a way.

569
00:35:58,124 --> 00:35:59,823
I have faith.

570
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:01,258
That's all. Out.

571
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,693
No, Brody! Brody!

572
00:36:08,034 --> 00:36:10,267
Fuck!

573
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:12,036
We are fucking moving out now.

574
00:36:12,038 --> 00:36:13,137
All of us. Let's go.

575
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:15,272
Not me.

576
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:51,475
He's gone! Fuck him!

577
00:36:51,477 --> 00:36:53,877
Hellfire, now! Hellfire, now!

578
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:56,880
Hellfire firing now.

579
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:04,955
Move. Move now!

580
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:07,524
Grab him!

581
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:15,666
- Take it.
- What are you doing?

582
00:37:15,668 --> 00:37:18,535
Get him to the LZ,
then come get me. Go!

583
00:37:18,537 --> 00:37:20,571
Fuck!

584
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,684
Fucking snipers.

585
00:37:33,686 --> 00:37:36,453
Always the stubborn
fucking assholes.

586
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,891
I can buy you 30 seconds
to cross that border

587
00:37:40,893 --> 00:37:42,192
and get to those trees.

588
00:37:42,194 --> 00:37:43,527
Once I start firing,
you start running.

589
00:37:43,529 --> 00:37:45,696
And if you stop,
I'll fucking shoot you myself.

590
00:37:45,698 --> 00:37:47,531
Any questions?

591
00:37:47,533 --> 00:37:49,266
- No.
- Oh, good.

592
00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:51,101
Count of three.

593
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:53,937
One... two... three!

594
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:05,415
What is that?

595
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:06,617
They're surrounded.

596
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:07,718
Who by?

597
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,620
Are we picking up
anything on radios?

598
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:14,358
...Nicholas Brody.

599
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:20,265
_

600
00:38:20,266 --> 00:38:22,061
_

601
00:38:22,062 --> 00:38:23,648
_

602
00:38:23,649 --> 00:38:27,112
_

603
00:38:30,489 --> 00:38:32,104
_

604
00:38:32,105 --> 00:38:33,812
_

605
00:38:33,813 --> 00:38:34,721
_

606
00:38:34,722 --> 00:38:35,892
_

607
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:56,867
The Iranians are saying
they have two prisoners.

608
00:38:56,869 --> 00:38:59,169
Are we sure it's the Iranians
and not the Iraqis?

609
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:01,271
100%.

610
00:39:01,273 --> 00:39:03,540
Jesus.

611
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:25,796
They got the
casualty out safely.

612
00:39:25,798 --> 00:39:29,566
He's stable, on a bird
out to the carrier group now.

613
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:35,239
There's something else.

614
00:39:35,241 --> 00:39:37,441
What?

615
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,879
Brody made it across.

616
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,383
How?

617
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:48,051
He made a last second
run for it--

618
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:50,787
headfirst
into an Iranian military unit.

619
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,991
He's okay?

620
00:39:53,993 --> 00:39:56,093
Yes.

621
00:40:04,837 --> 00:40:06,169
He made it.

622
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:07,404
And you, Saul,

623
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:10,207
are still in the game.

624
00:40:10,209 --> 00:40:13,176
I'll be damned.

625
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,591
Right now, these guys...

626
00:40:27,593 --> 00:40:30,294
uh, they're trained
to treat anybody coming

627
00:40:30,296 --> 00:40:32,496
over the border
as Israeli agents.

628
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,168
You were tortured...

629
00:40:40,705 --> 00:40:42,873
so tell me what to expect.

630
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:48,045
Expect to break.

631
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:00,190
How long did you hold out?

632
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:04,127
I don't know.

633
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:06,330
I lost track of time
pretty much right away,

634
00:41:06,332 --> 00:41:08,332
but I figure...

635
00:41:08,334 --> 00:41:10,767
seven days?

636
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:12,069
Enough time to allow the guys

637
00:41:12,071 --> 00:41:15,706
to change their frequencies
and battle plans.

638
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:19,910
I just...

639
00:41:19,912 --> 00:41:21,912
I just hope
I can give you seven days

640
00:41:21,914 --> 00:41:24,081
to get the job done in Tehran.

641
00:41:24,083 --> 00:41:26,083
Huh?

642
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:53,877
Hi.

643
00:41:53,879 --> 00:41:54,945
May I?

644
00:41:54,947 --> 00:41:56,947
Of course.

645
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:03,954
Fara, you're one of the few
people in this building

646
00:42:03,956 --> 00:42:06,523
who knows that Majid Javadi's
an Agency asset.

647
00:42:06,525 --> 00:42:07,858
I didn't breathe
a word to anybody.

648
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:11,028
I know you didn't--
that's not why I'm here.

649
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:13,997
But you had a crucial role
in recruiting Javadi.

650
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:17,134
In fact, Saul says, without you,
it never would've come off.

651
00:42:17,136 --> 00:42:19,136
He's exaggerating.

652
00:42:19,138 --> 00:42:20,804
But thank you.

653
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,808
The thing is...

654
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:27,577
Javadi's only half the play.

655
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:29,246
There's another phase
of the operation

656
00:42:29,248 --> 00:42:30,414
you weren't made aware of.

657
00:42:30,416 --> 00:42:33,150
It involves an asset,
whose life depends

658
00:42:33,152 --> 00:42:35,886
on us getting him out of Iran
at the critical moment.

659
00:42:35,888 --> 00:42:38,088
And the fact is
our extraction plan

660
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:40,323
just went up in smoke.

661
00:42:40,325 --> 00:42:42,659
I'm sorry.

662
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:46,663
Fara, you have
an uncle in Tehran.

663
00:42:46,665 --> 00:42:48,832
Your father's brother.

664
00:42:48,834 --> 00:42:50,767
- Carrie, no.
- Just hear me out.

665
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:52,702
No, it's too dangerous.

666
00:42:52,704 --> 00:42:54,337
- All we're asking for...
- You're asking me

667
00:42:54,339 --> 00:42:55,839
to put my family
at extreme risk.

668
00:42:55,841 --> 00:42:58,108
You know you are.

669
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,843
You forget I've seen firsthand

670
00:42:59,845 --> 00:43:02,946
how fast an operation
can go sideways.

671
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:06,683
Tell the truth.

672
00:43:06,685 --> 00:43:09,586
You would never ask your
own family to do this.

673
00:43:09,588 --> 00:43:12,389
I might.

674
00:43:12,391 --> 00:43:14,891
And from what I know about
your uncle, he's not one

675
00:43:14,893 --> 00:43:16,960
to cross the street to stay
out of trouble's way.

676
00:43:16,962 --> 00:43:19,529
He's a member of a moderate
opposition group.

677
00:43:19,531 --> 00:43:21,231
Not a bomb thrower.

678
00:43:21,233 --> 00:43:23,467
All we need is a place
to meet in the city.

679
00:43:23,469 --> 00:43:25,268
A de facto safe house.

680
00:43:30,075 --> 00:43:32,642
Fara, we have a brother agent
in the field,

681
00:43:32,644 --> 00:43:35,812
soon to be in mortal danger.

682
00:43:35,814 --> 00:43:39,149
Don't we owe him every chance
to get out alive?

683
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:57,134
Hey.

684
00:44:07,946 --> 00:44:10,714
Someone's coming.
Someone's coming.

685
00:44:30,101 --> 00:44:33,637
My name is Nicholas Brody...

686
00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:35,772
and I'm formally seeking asylum

687
00:44:35,774 --> 00:44:39,543
in the islamic Republic of Iran.

688
00:44:39,545 --> 00:44:41,378
I know who you are.

689
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:45,549
Ayman Jassim.

690
00:44:57,796 --> 00:44:59,796
Are you ready?

691
00:44:59,798 --> 00:45:01,865
Ready for what?

692
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:04,067
To go with me to Tehran.

693
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:10,473
What about him?

694
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:13,009
No! You fuck!

695
00:45:13,011 --> 00:45:14,711
- Quiet. Quiet!
- You fucking asshole!

696
00:45:14,713 --> 00:45:16,846
- What did you do that for?!
- Control yourself.

697
00:45:16,848 --> 00:45:19,482
- Fuck! Fuck!
- Calm down!

698
00:45:19,484 --> 00:45:22,552
Calm down.

699
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:40,337
Now.

700
00:45:40,339 --> 00:45:42,839
We go to Tehran.

701
00:45:50,461 --> 00:45:56,023
