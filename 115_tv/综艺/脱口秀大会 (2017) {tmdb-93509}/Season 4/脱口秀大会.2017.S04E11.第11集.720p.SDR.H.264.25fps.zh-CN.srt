00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi, I'm Leah and this  is Tuesday morning's Newround.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,989
The Vikings are back  in York, but don't worry!

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:23,989
And check out the largest  maze in Spain.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,989
But first this morning,  around 51,000 children

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,989
able to join the scouts,  beavers or cubs.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,989
there's a big shortage of volunteers  in areas like Surrey,

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,989
It means waiting lists can't fall  unless more adults join

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,989
They also say those who are signed  up currently aren't able

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:52,989
We have had a massive increase in  the number of adult volunteers in

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,989
Scouting, which is incredible but we  have also got the longest ever

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,989
waiting list for young people.  51,000 young people are waiting to

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,989
join Scouting. We need even more  adults to take the opportunity of

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,989
volunteering to give those young  people a life changing experience.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,989
One of Britain's biggest  tourist attractions,

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,989
the Jorvik Centre in York,  has reopened again over a year

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,989
after it was forced to close  because of flooding.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,989
We sent Ricky up for the reopening  and to find out about it.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:36,989
This is the Jorvik Centre,  one of the most popular

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,989
museums and visitor  attractions in the UK.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,989
They are finally reopening the doors  after severe flooding

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,989
When those floodwaters  came in there was

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,989
In some parts of the museum  it was about one metre high,

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:08,989
Most of us were at home enjoying  Christmas and we got a call,

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,989
I got a call to say water  was coming in the back door.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,989
We called in the conservation team,  the collections team, to come and

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,989
There are 1,000 objects  here and we had to get

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,989
Luckily, everything  in the museum was saved.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,989
Some of the items in  here are priceless.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,989
A lot of hard work,  a lot of people involved.

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,989
We decided early on we wanted to do  something different.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,989
Schoolkids have been coming  to this museum for more

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:50,989
Because it is a really cool place  and a lot could have been damaged.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,989
It was amazing how  civilised we were then.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,989
It really brought the  Viking period to life

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,989
and there were lots of different  things that were really interesting.

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,989
This team have worked hard  to protect the museum from future

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,989
flooding so people can continue to  see what the Vikings did

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,989
In sport, Crystal Palace  boosted their chances of staying

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,989
after beating Arsenal  three-nil.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,989
Arsenal's poor form puts more  pressure on manager Arsene Wenger,

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,989
who hasn't confirmed  whether he is signing a new contract

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,989
For now, he's staying tight-lipped  about his future at the club.

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:49,989
Tonight I am not in the mood to  speak about that. Wind you think you

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,989
will be...? I think at the moment it  is about paying more respect to the

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,989
fact that we had a disappointing  result and focus on that and not

46
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,989
find as well excuses that are not  excuses.

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,989
The first ever cargo train  from the UK to China

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:12,989
On an epic 7,500-mile  journey over 18 days.

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,989
It took loads of things to sell,  like fizzy drinks and medicines.

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,989
But what would you see, and need,  if you took the trip?

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,989
As the train pulls out of the base  in Essex it will travel

52
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,989
towards the Channel Tunnel,  meaning it

53
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,989
After resurfacing in France  you will travel on through

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,989
If you have a sweet tooth,  you might expect it to be

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,989
filled with fancy chocolate,  but instead you will see a lot of...

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,989
After cruising through  Germany, next is Poland.

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,989
It is one of nine countries  in the European Union that

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,989
Make sure you take some  Polish coins with you

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,989
If temperatures drop and it  snows, it might be worth

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,989
picking up a traditional Russian hat  with ear flaps to keep warm.

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,989
Kazakhstan is made up of a lot  of flat desert,

62
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,989
That is where Major Tim Peake  and his crew launched to get

63
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,989
to the ISS and landed  safely back on Earth.

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,989
China is famous for tea, The Great  Wall and making lots of things

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,989
Train bosses say the  7,500-mile trip to the

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,989
Chinese city by train is faster  than by sea and cheaper than by air.

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,989
And finally, we see a lot  of a-mazing things here

68
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:41,989
This is the largest maze in Spain -  its made from 4,000 trees,

69
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,989
is over five kilometres long  and it'll take you about an hour

70
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,989
Go online to find out why this  month's full moon is called

71
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,989
That's all we've got  time for this morning,

72
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,989
Newsround's back this  afternoon at 4:20.

73
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Have a great day. I will see you  tomorrow. Goodbye.
