1
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,860
向我们伸出援手吧 我们会使出浑身解数 Lend us your help and we will do whatever must be done

2
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,600
推动拿骚的进步 to move Nassau forward.

3
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,090
她同意了 格斯里夫人 She agreed. Madam Guthrie.

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,050
我们想要为拿骚做的任何事 Everything we want for Nassau.

5
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:27,420
但弗林特...她想要我杀了他 But Flint... she wants him dead and she wants me to do it.

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,630
他们都对我倒戈 They all turned on me

7
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,390
我要他们所有人为此付出代价 and I want them all to pay for it.

8
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,590
我尝试过一次 I tried once

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,180
但我当时没有离间他们的必备工具 but I didn't possess the instrument to make it work.

10
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,110
你有 You do.

11
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,680
再不同也不能让她成为你那战争的代价 Nothing justifies trading her life for your war.

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,710
没人说让她去送死 No one is saying that we let her die.

13
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,580
-你不能保证... -我们开去拿骚 - You cannot guarantee that... - We will sail to Nassau.

14
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,110
我们会找到她然后带她回来 And we will find her and we will bring her home.

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,760
你对他的计划充满了信心 You're confident in his plan

16
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,520
也许是因为这是个好计划 maybe because it's a good plan.

17
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,310
但也许你会告诉他 But maybe you'll have to show him

18
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,870
你准备好面对失败了 that you're prepared for the failure

19
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,720
还有他想埋在地下的那些财宝... and that a treasure he wanted left in the ground...

20
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,160
不复存在了 ain't in the ground no more.

21
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,270
我想此刻我该提醒你 Seemed only fair that I remind you

22
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,820
我们现在休戚与共 that our fates are now linked.

23
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,680
如果这个计划没有让我拿到宝藏 If this plan to secure the cache ends badly for me

24
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,110
你肯定也不会有什么好下场 you can be certain it will end badly for you.

25
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,310
宝藏在我说的地点 没错吧 It was where I said it would be was it?

26
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,120
盖茨先生跟弗林特的关系真是不一般 That's how close Mr. Gates was to Flint.

27
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,120
他把最心爱的宝贝都藏在他的地窖 Stored his most prized possessions in his cellar.

28
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,540
还有艾弗里的日记 Avery's journals.

29
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,320
尽管他们彼此信任 Despite that measure of trust

30
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,810
最后还不是因为在小钱上起了争执 all it took was a disagreement over a little money

31
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,020
就让弗林特动了歹念 for Flint to kill him.

32
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,780
两个人之间的感情再亲密 There are no two people close enough

33
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,850
也终究会因为某些事而产生隔阂 that something cannot separate them.

34
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,690
某种程度上来说 Some point at which

35
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,550
他们从一开始就没有多团结 they were never fully connected to begin with.

36
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,640
盖茨跟弗林特就是如此 It happened with Gates and Flint.

37
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,170
弗林特和西尔弗也会这样 It will happen with Flint and Silver.

38
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,810
这计划可行 This plan will work.

39
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,330
你不想让这场交易发生在这个岛上 You want the exchange of the money to happen off this island

40
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,570
交易地点最好没人知道 somewhere no one need know of it.

41
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,330
这正好 There it is.

42
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,160
你把他们引过去 You'll lead them there

43
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,420
他们会跟着来的 and they will follow you.

44
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,790
科菲和手下在去往拿骚的路上 Kofi and his men are on their way to Nassau.

45
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,420
然后该怎么办 What happens after this?

46
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,480
他们会从密道走 They'll use resistance routes

47
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,900
以防被总督的卫兵发现 to evade detection by the Governor's soldiers.

48
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,480
此刻他们大概已经快到镇子上了 They're probably already nearing town by now.

49
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,610
那里会有人跟他们接应 They'll find friends there

50
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,880
带他们去马迪被关押的地方 discover through them where Madi is being held

51
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,460
然后天亮之前就会回到岸边与我们碰头 and be back to the beach for us to recover by morning.

52
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,860
只要知道她的下落 Once we know where she is

53
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,600
我们就会采取行动救她出来 we'll move to get her out of there.

54
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,400
这一切行动之后呢 What happens after all of it?

55
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,610
假如你的计划成功 Assume your plan succeeds

56
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,410
把她活着救出来 and we retrieve her alive.

57
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,040
假如你的战争爆发... Assume your war begins...

58
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,400
并向新大陆全面蔓延 spreads throughout the New World.

59
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,340
我见过拿骚被战争波及的样子 I saw what came of Nassau when it was touched by it.

60
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,710
刚开始的时候 In the first instant

61
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:18,790
只是没有了埃莉诺·格斯里的贸易 it was deprived of Eleanor Guthrie's commerce

62
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,220
杰克·拉克姆带来的繁荣 or Jack Rackham's prosperity

63
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,360
或是伍兹·罗杰斯的镇压 or Woodes Rogers' oppression.

64
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,830
笼罩在拿骚上空的只有恐怖 There's nothing in Nassau but horror.

65
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,890
你说那只是一种转变 You said it was just a transition.

66
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,310
未来很美好 That something better lay beyond it

67
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,810
很有意义 something meaningful.

68
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,400
可如果不是那样的呢 But what if that isn't so?

69
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,520
如果战争的结果并没有摆脱恐怖的阴影呢 What if the result of this war isn't beyond the horror?

70
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,090
如果带来的只有恐惧呢 What if it is the horror itself?

71
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,790
这些你都想过吗 Have you given this any thought at all?

72
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:29,620
如果我们最终 If we are to truly reach a moment

73
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,630
真的会随着英格兰一同灭亡 where we might be finished with England...

74
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,350
成为新秩序的基奠... cleared away to make room for something else...

75
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,410
那么在实现这一目标的过程中 there most certainly lies a dark moment

76
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,700
肯定会有十分黑暗的时期 between here and there.

77
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,310
这段时期中 A moment of terror

78
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,090
一切都暗淡无光 让人丧失希望 where everything appears to be without hope.

79
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,300
这我知道 I know this.

80
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,010
但我不相信这就是全部 But I cannot believe that that is all there is.

81
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,280
我不相信我们沦落到了这个地步 I cannot believe we are so poorly made as that.

82
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:16,700
无法在我们长大的土地上生存下来 Incapable of surviving in the state to which we are born.

83
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,360
变得如此地习惯于被压迫 Grown so used to the yoke

84
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,530
以至于没有压迫就不会过日子了 that there can be no progress without it.

85
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,410
实在是很难去... It's a lot to ask...

86
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,240
为了盲目的信心而遭受如此的苦难 to wager so much suffering on blind faith.

87
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:41,160
也不完全只有信心 Well it isn't entirely faith.

88
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,240
我们有合适的人来带我们度过这一切 We'll have the right people in place to lead us through it

89
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,880
并在世界找到平衡点时让其重归完整 and hold the world together while it finds its balance.

90
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,480
你对我俩的期望太高了 You think so much of what you and I can accomplish together.

91
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,700
是你和她 You and her.

92
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,480
你和马迪 You and Madi.

93
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,100
她像她父亲一样睿智 She's as wise as her father.

94
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,940
像她母亲一样坚强 She's as strong as her mother.

95
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:13,120
拿骚没有谁 There isn't a man or woman in Nassau

96
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,440
会怀疑她是不是最佳人选 who'd argue that she isn't the best of them all.

97
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,840
宝藏和她都对我们的战争至关重要 The cache is critical to our war but so is she.

98
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,830
能让我们的联盟不瓦解 Critical to holding our alliance together.

99
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,680
我们必须要把她活着带回来 We absolutely must get her back alive.

100
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,360
你认为我是带领众人度过这一切难关的 And you think I'm the one best suited

101
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,440
最佳人选吗 to lead our people through this?

102
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,750
我觉得你是我们之中最合适的 I think that you are the best of us.

103
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:48,780
你们两个能让世界回归平衡 The two of you together are the world in balance.

104
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,240
无论比利造成了多大损失 For all the damage Billy's done

105
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,760
至少他在这点上是对的 at least he got that right.

106
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,990
好多了 Better.

107
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,480
抱歉昨天没来帮你治疗 Sorry I was not here to do this yesterday.

108
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,210
和格斯里夫人 The meetings with Madam Guthrie

109
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,290
以及她丈夫会面的时间每天都在变长 and her man grow longer every day.

110
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,170
我觉得我正慢慢获取她的信任 I believe I am gaining her trust.

111
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,820
我想我已经让他们觉得我们的提议是合理的 I believe I have persuaded them our proposal is sound

112
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,650
但是他们还是在提问 and still the questions continue.

113
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,820
但是我感觉到了一些东西 But I feel as though something is coming

114
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,200
她好像已经觉得这不再是我们的主意 a moment in which this will cease to be our idea

115
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,550
而是她自己的 and become her own.

116
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,190
如果我能成功达到这一目的 If I am able to reach that moment

117
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,010
并变成她真正的合伙人 and emerge from it a true partner to her

118
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,860
如果杰克能信守承诺 if Jack is able to fulfill his end of the bargain

119
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,890
我开始预见我们的未来了... I am beginning to see a future for us in which...

120
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,330
你为什么要这样 Why are you doing this?

121
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,820
煞有其事地说我们俩的事 Talking about us like it's a thing?

122
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,150
未来 A future?

123
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,570
我不知道谁先毁了未来 I don't know who broke it first.

124
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,180
但它已经被毁了 But it broke.

125
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:20,070
而且也没办法挽回了 And there ain't no putting it back together again.

126
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:37,960
你没事吧 Are you all right?

127
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,300
等等 Wait.

128
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,710
你需要什么吗 Is there something you need?

129
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,230
是的 Yeah.

130
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,850
我有需要 There is.

131
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,380
他们等了一小时就散了 They waited an hour before disbanding.

132
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:18,620
显然"总督正在赶过来"这句话 Evidently that is the lifespan of "The governor is on his way"

133
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,560
只配让人等一个小时 as a viable measure of delay.

134
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,650
解决我们问题的方案 The solution to our problems

135
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,680
是不可能通过内阁会议讨论出来的 is not going to come from a council meeting.

136
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,450
他们快对你没信心了 They are losing faith in you.

137
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,610
他们明白我们重建殖民地所面对的问题 They see the problems we face in rebuilding this colony

138
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,100
以及失败的风险 the dangers if we fail.

139
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,110
他们对你的怀疑与日俱增 And they are growing more and more skeptical by the day

140
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,170
怀疑你到底有没有解决方案 that you have anything in the way of a solution.

141
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,440
我所担心的比那个更糟 My fear is it's worse than that.

142
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,940
我担心他们发现你真正的解决方案 My fear is they will learn what your solution actually is.

143
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,330
我知道你打算用那个奴隶女人 I know you intend to ransom away that slave woman

144
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,250
去和弗林特船长及他的放逐者盟友 to Captain Flint and his maroon allies

145
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,980
交换海盗宝藏 in exchange for the pirates' cache of gems.

146
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,480
你如此明目张胆地进行这项交易 As brazenly as you pursued this bargain

147
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,470
你真以为没人会发现吗 did you really believe that no one would find out about it

148
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,950
我不会发现吗 that I wouldn't find out?

149
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,950
我的妻子促成了这项交易 索姆斯先生 My wife made the bargain for the cache Mr. Soames.

150
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,310
我只负责去拿货 All I'm going to do is collect.

151
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,820
海盗们已经走了 长官 The pirates are gone sir.

152
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,910
他们对我们的威胁已经解除了 长官 The threat that they presented us is done!

153
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,670
海盗们对我们的威胁从未如此严重过 The threat the pirates present has never been greater.

154
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,210
他们的目的是制造恐惧和破坏 Their intent is to cause terror and destruction

155
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,790
直到文明社会土崩瓦解为止 until civilization simply ceases to function.

156
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,680
-威胁不会... -保护文明社会 - The threat will not... - The defense of civilization

157
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,700
不是你的责任 长官 is not your responsibility sir!

158
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,040
你的责任是重新从拿骚获取稳定的利润 Your duty is to restore stable profits to Nassau.

159
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,440
听令尾随你的将士已经 And the men charged to follow you to that end

160
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,050
对您的威信产生质疑了 are already questioning their trust in you.

161
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,790
如果他们看见海盗重回这里 If they see pirates return here

162
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,590
如果他们看见这座小岛上冲突再起 if they see skirmishes begin again on this island

163
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:58,010
并且得知是你挑起的 and they know that it was because you invited it...

164
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:02,530
那你就自食这个兵变的恶果吧 长官 then you are going to have a mutiny on your hands sir.

165
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,890
我担心我丈夫的安危 "I fear for my husband's safety

166
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,230
担心他受我的死对头迫害 "From men I've long called enemies

167
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,520
担心他被我曾经的朋友陷害 "From men I once called friends.

168
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,450
我愿扭动乾坤来保护他 "I will move heaven and earth to protect him

169
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,530
但现在这一角色 but while playing this role

170
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,950
让我受到束缚无法施展影响 the limits of my influence are ever-present."

171
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,720
我刚在按您的吩咐收拾东西 大人 I was just packing everything away as you asked my lord.

172
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,890
准备好我的行李 Ready my things.

173
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,050
天一亮我就动身 I sail at first light.

174
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:07,060
对方一定是趁晚上在我们后面偷偷溜进去了 She must've slipped in behind us during the night.

175
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,140
已经停泊靠岸了 She's already at anchor.

176
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,850
看起来对方已经在等着我们了 Looks like she's been waiting for us.

177
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,050
好像早就知道我们要在哪靠岸 It looks like she knew where to wait for us.

178
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,410
老天爷 看他们船上 Jesus Christ! On their rail!

179
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,010
他抓住他们了 He caught them.

180
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,160
怎么可能 一夜之间吗 How's that possible? Overnight?

181
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,010
全带到甲板上 All up on deck!

182
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,050
拉起中帆 掉头 Back the fore-topsails. Bring us about.

183
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,960
-拉起中帆 -炮手就位 - Back the fore-topsails! - Gun crews at the ready!

184
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,310
-掉头 -你干什么 - Bring us about! - What are you doing?

185
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,190
我们把炮对准他们 We bring our guns to bear

186
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,580
他就会犹豫要不要杀了她 he'll think twice about killing her.

187
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,870
不必理会 Belay that order!

188
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,340
不必理会 Belay that order!

189
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,470
你去 现在就把东西带上来 Go get it. Bring it up here right now.

190
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,470
去干什么 Go get what?

191
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,320
你带了什么东西 What did you bring with us?

192
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:07,360
你的计划失败了 现在按我的计划来 Your plan failed. We're moving onto my plan.

193
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,980
你的命令别再说第二次 Do not repeat your order.

194
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,210
想都别想 Do not think about it.

195
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,530
带上来 Bring it up here.

196
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,590
放到他们能看见的地方 Get it where they can see it.

197
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:51,300
给他发信号 Signal him.

198
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,710
快去 Go!

199
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,330
给欧律狄刻号发信号 Signal the Eurydice.

200
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,910
快点 Do it now!

201
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,700
敲钟 Strike the bell!

202
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,680
打开 Open it.

203
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:58,040
他在收锚 他要去哪 He's hauling up the anchor. Where the fuck is he going?

204
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,990
不管他去哪 我们都跟着 Wherever he's going we follow him.

205
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,990
这应该是好事 This should be good.

206
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,770
我能为我们的总督大人做些什么 What is it I can do for our lord governor?

207
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,460
我不是代表总督来的 夫人 I don't come on behalf of the governor ma'am.

208
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,350
你是罗杰斯总督的女仆 不是吗 You are Governor Rogers' woman are you not?

209
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,790
我是 所以我信任你并且 I am which is why I believe you and I

210
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,640
也许我们能互相帮助 may be able to help each other.

211
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,630
说真的 夫人 找个私密点的地方更适合说事 Really ma'am someplace private may be more appropriate.

212
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,380
没有免费的私密空间 亲爱的 Privacy always comes with a price dear.

213
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,670
咱们先来看看你要说什么吧 好吗 Let's see what it is you have to say first shall we?

214
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:11,440
总督要破釜沉舟了 The governor moves in a dark and destructive direction.

215
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:15,000
他的悲痛和愤怒 His grief and his anger...

216
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,070
我相信已经让他远离清醒的判断 I believe have unmoored him from sound judgment

217
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,920
如不悬崖勒马 也会让我们置身于无尽的深渊 and have left us all in grave danger if he is not reined in.

218
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,610
你已经注意到了 对吗 You've noticed this have you?

219
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:32,060
你被管委会除名 You were excluded from the council.

220
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,560
不再干预其中的事情 On the outside of its goings-on.

221
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,460
我不知道你都了解什么情况 I don't know what information you were privy to--

222
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,410
我感谢你的关心 I appreciate your concern.

223
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,920
欢迎再次光临 Come back when you like.

224
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:47,320
我也许能帮你重新回去 I may be able to help you get back inside.

225
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,480
回到管委会吗 Back on the council?

226
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,670
继续说 Go on.

227
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:09,160
我发现了一本埃莉诺的日记本 I found a journal Eleanor kept.

228
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,670
她在里面说到 In it she mentioned that

229
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:16,760
拿骚上一次面临动荡的困境时 when Nassau last threatened to descend into chaos...

230
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:22,530
你是她求助以期力挽狂澜的人 you were the one to whom she turned to help prevent it.

231
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,200
总督身边的人 The men surrounding the governor

232
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,550
现在都无法有效地动摇他的地位 now have all failed to challenge him in any meaningful way.

233
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,590
我想着如果我能从内部 I am hoping that if I could provide you

234
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:37,130
给你提供他办公的一些消息 with information from inside his office...

235
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:41,320
也许能帮你重回管委会 it might help you maneuver your way back onto the council.

236
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:46,330
这在我听来很像叛国啊 That sounds an awful lot like treason to me.

237
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:52,660
政府方面先搁置不论 And what exactly aside from good government

238
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,010
你又到底想从中获得什么呢 do you hope to gain from this hmm?

239
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:05,420
埃莉诺承诺送我去伦敦 Eleanor promised me passage to London.

240
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,380
我将得以归家 A release from my service

241
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,180
摆脱这一切 that I might return home.

242
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,870
如果我帮了你 If I help you...

243
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,860
你会帮我吗 will you help me?

244
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,930
当你问我我能否帮你打听 When you asked me if I could help you learn

245
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,580
总督的船会去哪儿 where the governor's ship went...

246
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,090
要把弗林特船长引去哪儿 to what place he drew Captain Flint

247
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,300
我本以为我不可能帮上什么忙 I thought it unlikely I could be of much help.

248
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:55,400
但你肯定想不到刚刚谁来了我这儿 But you will never believe what just walked through my door.

249
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,140
-不是那儿吗 -什么 - Is that not it? - ‭What?

250
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,600
我们不像是准备靠岸的样子 We don't seem to be preparing for a landing.

251
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,500
前面不是我们的目的地吗 Is that not our destination ahead?

252
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:13,860
不是 No it isn't.

253
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:16,470
那只是个路标 It's a waypoint.

254
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,590
我们会在那岛上两处做标记 Two features on that island are the markers.

255
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:23,130
可能是两座山顶上或者海岸线上某两点 Maybe two peaks or some points along the coast.

256
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,580
你连接该两点所得的方向就是 You run a line through them and that direction becomes

257
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:28,770
总督去目的地所需设定的航向 the course the governor will set to reach our final destination.

258
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,570
你怎么知道的 How do you know that?

259
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:38,490
我不明白 I don't understand.

260
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,310
如果总督知道我们的终点 If the governor knows our destination

261
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:43,900
他为什么不能直接在航海图上定点作向呢 why can't he just plot a course directly to a spot on the chart?

262
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,250
因为骷髅岛不在任何一张航海图上 Because Skeleton Island is not on any chart

263
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:51,260
至少 不在任何一张书面的航海图上 not on any civilized one at any rate.

264
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,410
它很远 Remote.

265
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:57,170
在所有已建立的商路范围之外 Well outside any established trade route.

266
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,280
这座岛上所进行的交易 It's been used from time to time

267
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:04,270
往往是任何政党都不愿承认的 for transactions neither party wished would ever be acknowledged.

268
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,490
我当然爱她 Of course I love her.

269
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:13,260
我照你说的试了 I let you try it your way!

270
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,960
我的确信任你 I did trust you.

271
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:17,520
但我再也不想赌上她的命了 But I'm through wagering with her life now.

272
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:20,600
如果安全释放她的代价是交出宝藏 If what it takes to secure her release is to turn over the cache

273
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,650
那么我很庆幸我把宝藏带上了 I'm very glad I brought it with us.

274
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,410
我们本来 We had it.

275
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,120
我们本来大势在握 We had it in our hands.

276
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,520
这场战争本来一触即发 必打无疑 This war was breathing air it was alive.

277
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,970
现在尤利乌斯已经回到营地 Now Julius is back in that camp

278
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:35,440
指着地上的坑 pointing to a hole in the ground

279
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,630
告诉所有人 telling anyone who will listen

280
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,670
"这就是你信任一个海盗的下场" "This is what it looks like when you trust a pirate."

281
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,200
昨天 他还一无所有 Yesterday he had nothing.

282
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,190
只能对着虚无吼叫 He was shouting at the rain.

283
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,220
而现在是你让他有能力阻止这场战争 Now you've given him all he needs to kill this war dead.

284
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,410
天呐 My God.

285
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,890
那么多次 我盲目地听信你 The number of times I have followed you blindly

286
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,250
盲目地全力支持你 backed you with the men blindly

287
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:56,370
派人上那狗日的战场 put men in the fucking ground--

288
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,370
牺牲了那么多好人 朋友 就因为你说 good men friends-- because you said

289
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:01,620
我有办法 别问我怎么知道的 "I know the way. Don't ask me how.

290
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,200
就按我说的做 Just do as I say."

291
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,010
我可能并没明白你的办法 可能也不支持 I may not have understood it I may not have supported it

292
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,290
但我照你说的做了 but I did it!

293
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:11,160
真该死 现在你就是这么报答我的 And God damn it right now you're going to return the favor!

294
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,850
我们会尽可能在能力范围内 We will find a way to put it all back together

295
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:17,500
想办法解决这些问题 with whatever we have left at our disposal.

296
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,200
但你别再叫我在战争和妻子之间做抉择 But do not ask me to choose between a war and a wife.

297
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,340
你不会喜欢我的答案的 I do not think you're going to like the answer.

298
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,680
为了确保马迪能安全释放 Whatever must be done to secure Madi's release

299
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,780
我什么都愿意做 I'm going to do it.

300
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,460
我不指望你理解我 I do not expect your understanding

301
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,070
但我要求你支持我 but I demand your support.

302
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,260
作为我的同伴 As my partner

303
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:45,900
作为我的朋友 as my friend.

304
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,100
你支持我吗 Do I have it?

305
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,600
你支持我吗 Do I have it?

306
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,150
好 Yes.

307
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,350
你问的事情我查好了 I got what you asked.

308
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,880
这些船要么停在港口要么即将进港 These are the ships either in port or soon expected to be

309
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,340
并且都愿意载客 and willing to accept passengers.

310
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,130
你真的想要离开吗 You really intend to leave...

311
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,060
无论杰克会不会活着回来 whether Jack returns alive or not?

312
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,980
杰克会回来的 Jack will return.

313
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,730
杰克去追击弗林特船长了 Jack went to hunt Captain Flint.

314
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,960
你很可能再也见不到他了 Chances are good you've seen the last of him.

315
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,200
你害死了我的朋友 You killed a friend of mine.

316
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,770
她叫夏洛特 Her name was Charlotte...

317
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:44,840
而你杀人的理由还与她毫无关系 and you did it for reasons that had nothing to do with her.

318
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:51,320
我认识一些肯帮我杀了你的人 There were men I knew that would've killed you for me.

319
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,050
我本来想这么做 I wanted to ask them.

320
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,710
都凑够钱了 Had the money.

321
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:02,000
但麦克斯拒绝了我 But Max refused.

322
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:08,980
当时看不出来是不是因为她怕你 I couldn't tell then if it was because she was afraid of you.

323
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,570
怕也正常 我当时也怕你 Wouldn't have blamed her. I was.

324
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:16,660
但也许是有别的原因 Or if it was something else.

325
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,950
但我尊重了她的意愿 But I respected her wishes.

326
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:25,790
尊重她不管你做了什么也要保护你的愿望 Obeyed when she said we'd protect you despite what you'd done.

327
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,730
你知道为什么吗 Do you know why?

328
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,550
因为虽然她活着的每一天里 世界都在 Because despite the world reminding her every day of her life

329
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:36,420
提醒她 她没有活下去的资格 that she's undeserving of being given anything by it

330
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,620
她没有价值 that she was unworthy of

331
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,890
连她得到的一点点也不配拥有 what little she'd managed to take from it...

332
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,600
虽然如此 despite all of that

333
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,650
她从来没有绝望过 she never believed a word of it.

334
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,300
那个女人从她出生的那天起 That woman has been fighting the whole goddamn world

335
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,870
就在和世界抗争着 since the day she was born.

336
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,290
赢得那场战斗离她只有咫尺之遥 She's a breath away from winning that fight.

337
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:02,210
不管为什么 For whatever reason

338
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:05,520
她愿意和你分享这个成果 she wants to share the spoils with you.

339
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,130
你却离开了 And you'd walk away.

340
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:16,170
你害死了我的朋友 You killed my friend.

341
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,890
我觉得应该告诉你 I wanted you to know that.

342
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,630
这不是去格雷斯先生的图书馆的路上 We are not going to Mr. Grace's library.

343
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:24,730
你不是说想让我今天去那儿见一个人 I understood there was someone you wanted me to meet there today.

344
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:26,470
改变计划了吗 Has something changed?

345
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:46,570
跟我走 Walk with me.

346
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,030
这就是那些海盗 Those are the pirates.

347
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,360
他们占领了东岸 They've inhabited the east bank

348
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,950
与斯普林格特岛隔海相望很多年了 across from Springett Island for years.

349
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:11,870
政府保证今年就赶走他们 The governor promises this is the year he'll chase them off

350
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,580
但他们还在 but there they are.

351
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:19,770
城里七大主要海运都需要通过这里 Seven major shipping concerns in the city here.

352
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,940
再用不到10年 这里将成为伦敦外 In less than 10 years more goods will move through here

353
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:27,360
英语国家进出口量最大的海港 than any English-speaking port outside London.

354
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:30,280
这里将建起城市 There will be civilization here.

355
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,730
那么海盗去哪里 Where will the pirates be?

356
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:39,390
在东岸 与斯普林格特岛隔海相望 On the east bank across from Springett Island.

357
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,360
为什么 Why?

358
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:43,690
因为运输的商船 Because the shipping concern

359
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:47,300
要为预防海盗袭击交额外的保险费 charges a premium for the risk the pirates present.

360
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:50,510
我想总督也是从中获利的 I assume the governor too profits from this.

361
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,230
盗贼是存在 但所有人都受益 There is theft but everyone benefits.

362
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:57,060
那怎么会有人想结束这种状况 Why would anyone want to end it?

363
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,610
你和我孙女关系如何 How well did you know my granddaughter?

364
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:08,420
很熟 I knew her well.

365
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,750
她幸福吗 Was she happy?

366
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,660
幸福 Happy?

367
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,560
我也知道一些拿骚的事 There are things I know about Nassau

368
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,940
她的事 about her.

369
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:21,450
但隔着大海 总还是有了解不到的细节 There are things that are harder to know across an ocean.

370
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:25,650
我真的不知道 I honestly do not know.

371
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,800
她祖父很久以前与她断绝了关系 Her grandfather disowned her some time ago

372
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,110
觉得和野蛮的人在一起 她也会被同化 assumed she'd simply become one with the wild men.

373
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:37,740
庭审开始时 When the trial began

374
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,800
格斯里成了伦敦流言中卑劣的姓氏 and Guthrie became a contemptible name to utter in London

375
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:44,350
只让情形更加恶化 didn't help matters.

376
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,870
但一开始我就一直心怀希望 But I held out hope from the beginning.

377
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:53,990
幻想着不管我们听说了什么事 A fantasy that despite what we'd heard of her

378
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:56,780
她也在从中学习 成长着 she was learning growing.

379
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:01,070
幻想总有一天 她会来找我 And that someday she'd seek me out and...

380
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,620
幻想一个有着年轻时的 a woman who reminded me of myself

381
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,910
我的影子的女人会来波士顿 when I was younger would arrive in Boston

382
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:10,900
我会和她漫步在查尔斯河边 and I'd walk the Charles with her

383
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:15,350
教她一个女人在这世界中能有多大作为 and teach her the things a woman can do in this world.

384
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:21,030
虽然你不是她 我们也不在查尔斯河边 It's the wrong river and the wrong woman

385
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:25,610
但一个幻想能实现到这一步也不容易了 but perhaps to get even this close to a fantasy is something.

386
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:31,420
所以 让我们别再谈论经济 So let us assume that we're past conversations about ledgers

387
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:35,760
对你的考量结束了 我也听了你的提议 and that the measuring of you and your proposal are done

388
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,650
让我们一起开始一场冒险 and that we are partners in a venture

389
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:43,480
占领 重建拿骚 to acquire and reform Nassau.

390
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:48,350
现在关于这场冒险剩下的唯一问题就是 So now all that's left to know about this venture

391
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:51,090
谁将是领导者 is who is going to lead it.

392
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,070
爱德华·霍顿 Edward Houghton.

393
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:07,350
他们家族银行业务的唯一男性继承人 The only male heir to his family's banking operation.

394
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:10,090
极其呆板 Supremely uncurious

395
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,560
不怎么聪明 但本性还算不坏 bordering on dim but fundamentally decent.

396
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,580
他主导的投资项目顶多能盈利一点儿 The investments he's overseen have shown modest gains at best

397
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,280
经常亏损 and losses more frequently.

398
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:23,980
他不是你心目中管理拿骚的人选 This is not the man you would like to put in charge of Nassau.

399
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,110
我倒想让你去管理拿骚 I'd like to put you in charge of Nassau.

400
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,430
但是在这个问题上 But on this particular issue

401
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:33,320
没人管我怎么想 the world won't much care for what I'd like.

402
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:36,770
可供选择的人里 这个人还算有点价值 And of the men available this one has merits.

403
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:40,440
如果他能远离家族事业 His family would be relieved beyond measure

404
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,580
在其他地方开疆辟土 他的家族就解脱了 that he'd found himself a future far away from their business.

405
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,040
他能带来资金 He'd come with money

406
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:50,110
能敞开大门欢迎新搭档 he'd open doors to new partners...

407
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,660
他还是所有人中 and he'd be most amenable

408
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:55,560
最言听计从的 to doing whatever else you told him to do.

409
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:00,020
你觉得他会听从我这个顾问的建议吗 You think he would listen to me as an advisor?

410
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:12,120
你觉得如果我是他的妻子 他会听从我 You think he would listen to me as a wife.

411
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,490
也不一定得是他 I suppose it needn't be him.

412
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,140
但要想得到你需要的控制权 But to have the kind of control you will need to have

413
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:29,710
就必须得有人担任这个角色 there will need to be someone occupying the role

414
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:34,470
他还必须能一次性解决所有问题 and that someone solves a number of problems all at once.

415
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:38,310
拥有资金 没有野心 Money limited ambition...

416
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:44,900
有觉得你的故事激励人心并决意改革的父母 and reform-minded parents would find your story most intriguing.

417
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:54,330
至于你对他的义务 In terms of your obligations to him

418
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:57,020
无论有没有你的参与 there are plenty of ways for a man like that

419
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:00,080
他都可以在拿骚 to retain satisfaction in a place like Nassau

420
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:03,600
找到乐子 with little or no participation from you.

421
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:09,420
你也可以享有你所期盼的自由 You'd likely retain as much freedom in that regard as you desired.

422
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,210
从你开始崛起 To rise from where you began

423
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:16,160
走到你现在的位置 to where you now stand

424
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,540
我无法想象你所经历的是什么样的旅程 I cannot imagine the road you've traveled.

425
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:22,640
那些羞辱 The humiliations

426
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:25,020
那些牺牲 and the sacrifices

427
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,650
那些失败 and the defeats...

428
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:30,380
以有那些幻觉 and the illusions maintained

429
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:33,880
都让你的自主意识付出了沉重的代价 at so great a cost to your sense of self.

430
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:39,450
但是它将你引领到我这里 But that road has led you to me.

431
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:45,460
我就站在你旅途转折的起点 I am the gate through which your journey becomes something else.

432
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:49,780
我可以让你追求的梦想实现 I can make the dreams you have built real.

433
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:59,320
代价不大 但是你得付出 The toll is small but it must be paid.

434
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:03,090
告诉我你已经准备好付出了 Tell me you're ready to pay it...

435
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:06,370
然后我们一起下楼 and you and I will walk downstairs

436
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:08,330
我会把你介绍给他 I will introduce you to him

437
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:09,870
若如我所料 and-- as I imagine

438
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:12,760
接下来的事情你便驾轻就熟了 you'll have no difficulty taking things from there.

439
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,610
我们的合作关系将完全巩固 Our partnership may move forward fully formed.

440
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,240
你准备好了吗 Are you ready to do it?

441
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:39,550
那人年纪相当大了 That is a very old man.

442
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:41,770
总督的女人偷听到 The governor's woman overheard

443
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:44,800
他的船驶向了骷髅岛 his ship was bound for Skeleton Island.

444
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,900
据可靠消息 那个男人 That man I have it on good authority

445
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:51,660
是这个岛上仅剩的曾和艾弗里出海的人 is the last man on this island once sailed with Avery.

446
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:54,540
声称去过骷髅岛 Claims to have been to Skeleton Island

447
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,080
可以带我们过去 and can show us the way.

448
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,820
你相信他能做到吗 And you believe he can do it?

449
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:04,420
以我来看最终就是两种可能 Two possible outcomes as far as I can tell.

450
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,290
第一种 他没找到 One he fails

451
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:08,360
那我们就四处晃晃 直到筋疲力尽 in which case we sail around till we tire of it

452
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,880
再回大本营 then go back to the camp.

453
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,900
或者第二种 Or two

454
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:16,740
他奇迹般地带我们找到了那里 by some miracle he actually succeeds in getting us there.

455
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:22,590
我说不出哪种更好 And I can't tell which of the two is of more concern.

456
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,430
那是什么意思 What does that mean?

457
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:28,170
杀了弗林特本就是近乎不可能的事情 Killing Flint was already going to be a near impossible feat.

458
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:31,310
现在我们还得躲避总督和他的手下 Now we need to evade the governor and his soldiers as well.

459
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,790
在这儿坐等总督替我们杀了他 Wouldn't it make a whole lot more sense

460
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:37,210
不是更有道理吗 to just wait for the governor to kill him for us?

461
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:39,050
如果伍兹·罗杰斯取得了宝藏 If Woodes Rogers secures that cache

462
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:42,100
他的位置就坐稳了 he secures his position here as well.

463
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,890
那我们就无法灭了他了 Negates our plan to see him removed.

464
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:45,920
他就赢了 He wins.

465
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,510
-是 但是 -我们要的东西都在那个岛上 - Yeah but-- - Everything we need is on that island.

466
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:54,290
弗林特 罗杰斯 我的宝藏 Flint Rogers and my cache of gems.

467
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:58,310
如果那个老头儿能带我们去那里 If that very old man over there can get us there...

468
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:02,070
我们为什么还傻站在这儿 why are we still standing here?

469
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,220
如果你留他活路 If you leave him alive long enough

470
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,190
总有一天他会让你付出代价 he's going to make you pay for it.

471
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:34,510
他不会与我对抗 He won't move against me.

472
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:38,280
这事会过去的 This will pass.

473
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,030
这个话题也到此为止 And that's the end of this conversation.

474
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:49,950
如此多的谎言 只为否定一个简单的事实 So many lies to deny a simple truth.

475
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:52,690
什么 What?

476
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:56,590
权力不可分割 The crown does not divide.

477
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:58,200
不可共享 It cannot be shared.

478
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,430
你心里清楚 你也想他死 You know it. You want it done.

479
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:02,560
你只是还不知道该如何开口 You just don't know how to ask yet.

480
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:12,870
你给我听好了 Hear me very clearly.

481
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,390
没有隐藏讯息 也没有模拟两可 There is no hidden message and no equivocation.

482
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,440
你不准对他下手 You will make no move against him.

483
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,340
你不许对任何船员提起这件事 You will not speak of doing so

484
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:26,580
也不许再跟我提起 to any man on this crew nor to me again.

485
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:31,220
要是违抗我 你将承担后果 Do it and you'll answer for it.

486
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,370
你在外面干什么 Fuck you doing out here?

487
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,400
外面一团乱 快进来吧 It's a fucking mess out here. Come inside.

488
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:08,060
不进也行 Or don't.

489
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:10,460
我不在乎 I don't care.

490
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:13,260
成功了 It happened.

491
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:19,650
她答应了我和我们的计划 She has committed to the plan to me.

492
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:24,570
从我们来到这里就一直努力实现的那一刻 The moment we have been working towards since we arrived...

493
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:27,350
真的成真了 it happened.

494
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:31,220
这是好事 That's good news.

495
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,710
你为什么这幅表情 So why do you look like that?

496
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:40,510
我跟她说了我不同意 I told her I could not agree to it.

497
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:43,080
你拒绝她了吗 You told her no?

498
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:45,010
她需要一个人去坐总督的位置 She needs for there to be a man

499
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:47,730
但不是杰克 in the governor's office not Jack.

500
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:52,590
她亲自选的人 并且要我嫁给他 A man of her choosing and she wants me to be his wife.

501
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:54,000
嫁给他 His wife?!

502
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,360
只是名义上做做样子 仅此而已 In name only and for appearance's sake nothing more.

503
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:01,060
这样我们就能掌握权力 The power would rest with us.

504
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,190
只是做做样子吗 Just for appearance?

505
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:09,650
而你却拒绝了 And you said no?

506
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:13,040
你为什么要那么做 Why would you do that?

507
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:21,340
我还记得第一次见到埃莉诺时 I remember when I first met Eleanor

508
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:23,170
我有多么震撼 how stunned I was.

509
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:25,810
这个女人言行独特 A woman who spoke the way she did

510
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,960
对这个世界和统治阶级的男性毫无惧意 who had no fear of the world or the men who reigned over it.

511
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,520
我成为她的爱人时 看着她作出那些决定 When I became her lover I watched the decisions she made...

512
00:46:34,610 --> 00:46:36,660
我决心从中学习 and resolved to learn from them.

513
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:40,550
我成为她的敌人时 看着她犯下那些错误 When I became her rival I watched the mistakes she made

514
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:42,840
我决心不会犯下相同的错误 and resolved never to repeat them.

515
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:44,860
可是最终 But at the end

516
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:48,130
当我觉得自己在各方面都已经超越她时 when I felt I had surpassed her in every way

517
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:50,520
她似乎还有话 it seemed as though there was

518
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,530
想要对我说 something she was still trying to say to me.

519
00:46:56,330 --> 00:47:00,450
她放弃了自己以巨大牺牲换来的一切 Surrendering everything she had sacrificed so dearly for

520
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:04,930
就为了不失去所爱之人 because it would have come at the expense of the one she loved.

521
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:09,830
她试图告诉我 可我却听不进去 She was trying to tell me I just could not hear her

522
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:12,060
什么才是真正重要的 about what is truly important.

523
00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:16,590
我拒绝了玛丽昂·格斯里的计划 I said no to Marion Guthrie's plan...

524
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:19,740
尽管我别无选择 despite having no alternative

525
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:23,130
尽管我全部的努力都可能付诸流水 and at the risk of losing the entire endeavor

526
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:27,810
因为我不能让一个男人占据那个位子 because I refuse to situate a man in a position

527
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:30,310
否则他迟早会 where he might interfere one day

528
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:33,570
对我俩的关系造成影响 with my ability to repair things with you.

529
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:46,810
你是我认识的最勇敢的人 You are the bravest person I have ever known.

530
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:52,710
最真诚的人 The truest person I have ever known.

531
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:57,260
然而我却背叛了你 我自己都厌恶自己 And I betrayed you and it sickens me.

532
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:11,150
很抱歉 我曾努力保护的东西根本不重要 I am so sorry for working so hard to protect the wrong things.

533
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,640
我没能看清事实 没有你 For failing to see that there is nothing important

534
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,910
一切都失去意义 that does not include you.

535
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:23,490
我听说 The story as it was recounted to me

536
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:27,870
艾弗里是第一个发现那个岛的英国人 is that Avery was the first Englishman to find the island.

537
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:32,300
西班牙人之前在那个岛上 The Spanish had been using it

538
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:35,510
进行非法交易 已经有几十年 to conduct illicit transactions for decades.

539
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:38,790
艾弗里打算设下埋伏 偷袭他们 Avery plans to lie in wait for them.

540
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:42,700
他和四十四个船员抵达后 He and his crew of 44 arrive

541
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:44,380
驶向内陆 and sail inland.

542
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:54,410
可是当他们沿着水湾驶入时 But as they move up the inlet

543
00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:57,550
他们见到了最意想不到之事 they see something most unexpected.

544
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:06,830
一艘西班牙船只 She was Spanish

545
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:09,960
但不是他们在找的船 but not one of the ships they'd been hunting.

546
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,640
这艘船很早之前就停靠在这了 This ship had been there far longer than that.

547
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:18,920
船长的日志显示这艘船 Captain's log identifies her having set sail

548
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,300
1636年从哈瓦那出发 from Havana in 1636.

549
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:24,930
船上31名船员 31 souls aboard.

550
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:28,680
艾弗里发现了31名船员的尸体 Avery finds the remains of all 31.

551
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,390
惨遭虐杀 Slaughtered.

552
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:32,890
野蛮兽性惨不忍睹 Brutally so.

553
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:35,660
迹象表明其中许多人 Evidence that a number of them

554
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:39,180
活着的时候就被肢解了 had been dismembered while still alive.

555
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:42,040
他们是岛上居民吗 There were natives on the island?

556
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:45,770
船上发现了31具直挺挺的尸体 All 31 bodies were found still on the ship

557
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:48,470
被锁在船舱里 locked inside the hold.

558
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:51,220
从里面反锁 Locked from within.

559
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,050
活人吃活人 They ate each other alive.

560
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:01,330
艾弗里声称见过航海日志 Avery claimed to have seen the log.

561
00:51:02,050 --> 00:51:05,450
日志上说船员拒绝上岸 It said that the crew had refused to go inland

562
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:08,250
搜寻食物和淡水 to forage for food or for fresh water.

563
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:12,430
第一批上岸的人回来 That the first men in had returned

564
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:15,820
汇报来自林子里的声音 reporting sounds coming from the forest.

565
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,270
他们说那个声音听起来 The men said it sounded to them

566
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:23,640
像上帝之音 like the voice of God...

567
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,720
警告他们保持距离 warning them to stay away.

568
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:02,170
艾弗里故事中的编造成分有待考证 It's an open question how much of this story Avery invented.

569
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:04,420
但有一点毫无疑问 But what is undeniably true

570
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:08,640
这个故事十分有效地 is how undeniably effective that story has been

571
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,740
导致了某种结果 in achieving a result.

572
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,460
船长 Captain...

573
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:26,470
比利的选择并不意外 It's no accident that Billy chose it.

574
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:31,380
一个有可能让我们失去平衡的地方 A place likely to put us all out of balance

575
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,400
精神失去控制 where our imaginations might run wild

576
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:36,880
我们心中最邪恶的念头被唤醒 and our darkest impulses

577
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:41,650
从而让我们难以反抗 somehow made far more difficult to resist.

578
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,940
如果我们这次要死里逃生 If we are to survive this experience...

579
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:49,740
如果我们的目标是为了活命 if our cause is to survive

580
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:53,440
我们中一定要有人找到保持理智的方法 some of us must find a way to keep our wits about us

581
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,850
为了那些意志力薄弱的人 on behalf of those who cannot.

582
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,900
克服恐惧冲破阴霾 See the truth ahead of us

583
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,450
找到前方的真理 through the fear and the haze.

584
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:05,660
西尔弗先生恐怕 Mr. Silver I fear

585
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,420
关于此事有所妥协 is compromised in this regard.

586
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:12,590
此时此刻 At this moment...

587
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:18,270
我觉得我需要一个新的搭档 I find myself in need of a new partner.

588
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,230
我就知道会走到这一步 I knew it would come to this.

589

我试着警告他 I tried to tell him.

00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:34,720
我们交恶 We fight

591
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:38,500
只会有两个结果 only two outcomes I can see--

592
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:42,470
要么我死要么你亡 I die or you die.

593
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:46,560
不管什么结果他都会怪罪于我 Either way he's gonna take me to blame for it.

594
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,950
你在他心里的地位就有这么重要 That's how far you've burrowed into his head.

595
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,360
他不会对你置之不理 He won't put you out of it

596
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:57,530
直到他看清楚你的为人 until he sees you for what you are.

597
00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:04,870
走 Go.

00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,200
弗林特船长杀了我一个手下 Captain Flint killed one of my men

602
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:42,640
把宝藏偷走了 and managed to haul the cache to shore.

603
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:46,560
我来这里是希望可以在你得知消息前 I came in the hopes my presence might buy us some time

什么样的补救措施 What sort of remedy is that?

607
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,820
我派了六个人追捕他 I sent six of my men after him.

608
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:09,570
我剩下的人中最好的人手 The best men I have left.

609
00:57:09,810 --> 00:57:13,780

没错 Yes.

615
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,490
你还叫他们干什么 What else did you tell them to do?
