339
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,489
I'LL TAKE A BANANA SPLIT.

340
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:03,823
UH... WE DON'T
HAVE THAT.

341
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:04,924
THAT'S OKAY.

342
00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:08,128

353
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:28,848
WHY, YES, IT IS.

354
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:31,218
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD
GO GOOD WITH THAT?

355
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:32,752
NO, WHAT?

356

( gasping )

384
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:56,936
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

385
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:02,209
A TAILOR.

386
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:04,877
BECAUSE I RIPPED MY PANTS.

387
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,946
( laughing )

388
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:08,315

390
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:11,918
WHAT IS THAT?

391
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:15,755
THAT WASN'T
FUNNY, SPONGEBOB.

392
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:18,225
Y'ALL HAD ME
WORRIED SICK.

393
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:22,862
DUDE.

394

397
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:34,574

COME ON, THINK!

404
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:48,788
I GOT IT!

405

PANTS RIPPED OFF.

408
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:56,863
HUH?

409
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:58,398
SOMEONE CALL THE POLICE.

410
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:00,867
THERE'S A PANTS THIEF
ON THE LOOSE.

411
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:05,004
( wind howling )

OH, NO!

415
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,945
EVERYBODY'S GONE, EVEN SANDY.

416
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,047
SHE'D RATHER HANG OUT
WITH LARRY.

417

WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "WE"?

421
00:20:27,294 --> 00:20:31,030
OH, I DIDN'T HAVE TO BE A FOOL
TO GET SANDY'S ATTENTION.

422
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:34,367
AM I THE BIGGEST LOSER
ON THE BEACH?

423
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,068
NO, I AM.

424
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,738
I FORGOT TO PUT ON SUNSCREEN.

( electronic buzzing )

426
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:42,008
OUCH.

427
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:43,510
NO, I AM.

428
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:46,646
I GOT SAND
IN MY BUNS.

NO, I'M THE BIGGEST LOSER
ON THE BEACH.

431
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,924
THEY BURIED ME IN THE SAND
AND FORGOT ME.

432
00:20:58,024 --> 00:21:00,660
All:
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

433
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,330
I LOST MY BEST FRIEND.

434
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,565
HOW?

435
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,468
* WHEN I RIPPED...

436
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:09,536
( rip )

437
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:11,704
* MY PANTS...

438
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:15,074
* I THOUGHT THAT I HAD
EVERYBODY ON MY SIDE *

439
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:19,045
* BUT I WENT
AND BLEW IT ALL SKY-HIGH *

440
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:22,782
* AND NOW SHE WON'T EVEN SPARE
A PASSING GLANCE *

441
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:25,017
* ALL JUST BECAUSE I...

442
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,052
( rip )

443
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:27,086
* RIPPED MY PANTS.

444
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:29,121
* WHEN BIG LARRY CAME ROUND

445
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:30,990
* JUST TO PUT HIM DOWN

446
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:35,061
* SPONGEBOB TURNED
INTO A CLOWN *

447
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:38,798
* AND NO GIRL
EVER WANTS TO DANCE *

448
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:40,667
* WITH A FOOL WHO WENT AND...

449

( rip )

450
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:42,802
* RIPPED HIS PANTS.

451
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:45,004
* I KNOW I SHOULDN'T
MOPE AROUND *

452
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:46,373
* I SHOULDN'T CURSE

453
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:50,843
* BUT THE PAIN FEELS
SO MUCH WORSE *

454
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:54,246
* 'CAUSE WINDIN' UP WITH NO ONE
IS A LOT LESS FUN *

455
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:56,449
* THAN A BURN FROM THE SUN

456
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:59,419
* OR SAND IN YOUR BUNS.

* NOW I LEARNED A LESSON
I WON'T SOON FORGET *

461
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:09,996
* SO LISTEN
AND YOU WON'T REGRET *

462
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:11,964
* BE TRUE TO YOURSELF

463
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,933
* DON'T MISS YOUR CHANCE

464
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:16,035
* AND YOU WON'T END UP

465
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:22,274

SANDY!

470

YOUR SONG IS TRUE.

IF Y'ALL WANT
TO BE MY FRIEND

472

JUST BE YOURSELF.

473
00:22:45,432 --> 00:22:48,701
SPONGEBOB, THAT WAS
SO RIGHTEOUS.

474
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:50,937
WOULD YOU
SIGN MY PANTS?

475
