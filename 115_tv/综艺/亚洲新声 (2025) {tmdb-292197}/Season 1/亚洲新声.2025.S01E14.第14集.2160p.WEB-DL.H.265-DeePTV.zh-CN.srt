00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,720
# Let's play 

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,840
# Let's play 

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,120
# Let's have an adventure, hooray 

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,480
# Let's play 

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,240
# Who could we be today? 

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,560
# What could we do? 

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,320
# I'd like to drive a racing car or fly to the moon 

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,320
# I could be a fire fighter, a farmer or a vet 

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,600
# A knight in shining armour 

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,600
# Or I could be a chef 

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,280
# Let's play 

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,600
# Let's play 

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,920
# Let's have an adventure today. # 

14
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,800
Right, that should do it. I'm taking a picture. 

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,400
I have to make sure I'm ready before the... 

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,680
CAMERA CLICKS 

17
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,280
Oh, no! It's taken the picture already. Let's try it again. 

18
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,080
There. 

19
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,440
Hey, Sid, what are you doing? 

20
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,080
HE MUMBLES 

21
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,520
- Sorry? 
- I'm taking a... 

22
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,320
- CAMERA CLICKS 
- Oh, no, it's done it again! 

23
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,840
Why are you taking a picture of yourself? 

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,520
I've got a brilliant frame and want a good picture to go in it. 

25
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,520
- A good picture? 
- Yeah. 
- Why didn't you say? You can take my picture. 

26
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,560
I have lots of pictures of you with your thumbs up. 

27
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,600
Rebecca at the seaside. Rebecca at Christmas. 

28
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,160
Rebecca running the egg-and-spoon race and winning. 

29
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,280
Aww, I quite like that pose. 

30
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,240
I'll tell you what, I'll use the other thumb. 

31
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,080
I like the thumbs-up thing, 

32
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,920
but I'm looking for something a little bit more exciting. 

33
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,040
- Hold on, Sid. That picture will have to wait. It's time. 
- Great! 

34
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,840
- It's time to play. 
- Whose turn is it today? 

35
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,680
- Let it be me. 
- Let it be me. 

36
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,160
- Me! 
- Me! 

37
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,360
# Let it be me, me, me 

38
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,440
# Let it be me 

39
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,160
# Let it be me 

40
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,080
# Let it be me, let it be me 

41
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,480
# I really, really, really, really hope that it's me 

42
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,440
# Let, let, let, let, let, let, let it be me! 

43
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,000
# Let it be me, let it be me 

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,040
# I really, really, really, really hope that it's me. # 

45
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,280
- Could it be me? 
- Could it be me? 

46
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,840
It's me! 

47
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,200
# Yes, it's me, yes, it's me 

48
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,800
# I'm really, really, really, really happy it's me! # 

49
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,360
Look, there's the dressing up room. 

50
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,920
# Let's play. # 

51
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,040
So what are we going to play? 

52
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,480
Let's find out. 

53
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,720
So, a hula outfit, a sea captain's hat 

54
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,400
and animal feet? 

55
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,040
Well, that's silly. Let's try again. 

56
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,280
So, we've got on a wet suit and flippers - 

57
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,840
so what do you think we're playing today? 

58
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,000
Of course, we're playing at being divers who jump into the sea 

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,320
and swim around and look at fish. 

60
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,240
So what do we need to know? 

61
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,680
Bouncy ball, Rebecca. 

62
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,880
Divers swim under water using air tanks to breathe. 

63
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,960
They also wear heavy weight belts 

64
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,160
to help them sink down as far as they want to go. 

65
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,760
Divers talk to each other by using special hand signals. 

66
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,960
This means "OK". 

67
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,320
This means "octopus". 

68
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,280
And you'll need to do this one if you see a shark. 

69
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,360
Not all sea creatures swim. 

70
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,680
Some, like anemones, cling to rocks and have stinging tentacles 

71
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,920
which they pull in when things touch them. 

72
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,240
So that's what we need to know, and do we need anything else? 

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,680
Oh, what's this? 

74
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,600
Well, it looks like a metal pointy thing. 

75
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,920
Well, I'm sure it will come in handy. 

76
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,240
OK, so we've got everything we need. Let's go! 

77
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,240
Ssh! 

78
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,280
- Oh, Rebecca! 
- Sorry, I couldn't resist. 

79
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,240
Can you guess what we're playing today? 

80
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,120
- Oh, yes, you're going to be a doctor in the surgery. 
- Eh? No! 

81
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,040
- We're playing at being divers. 
- I know you are. I'm only joking. 

82
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,600
- You're going to see lots of cool fish. 
- Oh, I hope so. 

83
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,880
While you're gone, 

84
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,800
I'm going to practise making the best picture ever for my frame. 

85
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,240
- Perhaps I'll give a nice, big, dramatic pose. 
- Wow, that looks good. 

86
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,400
- Well, wish me luck. 
- Luck. 
- Bye! 
- Bye! 

87
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,040
# Let's play. # 

88
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,600
Come on, then, let's play at being divers. 

89
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,280
Woo-hoo! 

90
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,400
# Let's play. # 

91
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,400
Whoa! 

92
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,000
Oh, wow, I'm in a boat 

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,080
and I'm in the middle of the sea. 

94
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:44,440
I wonder if there's anybody else out here. Oh, a telescope. 

95
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,520
Right, let's take a look. 

96
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,440
There's somebody and he's in a boat too. 

97
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,920
Right, let's row over and say hello. 

98
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,880
# La la la la la. # 

99
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,720
- Excuse me. 
- Oh, I heard something! 

100
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,040
- Hello! 
- Hello, Mr Fish. How can I help you? 

101
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,720
Do you want to come out of the water, Mr Fish? 

102
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,480
No, it's me, Rebecca, over here in this boat. 

103
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,840
Ah, it is you talking. 

104
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,000
It is not him down there. 

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,200
Right. 

106
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,320
Can I come into your boat, please? 

107
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,200
Yes, yes, yes, come, come, come, oui, oui, oui. 

108
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,680
There you are. Be careful. Bravo. 

109
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,040
- Hello, I'm Rebecca. 
- Hello, Rebecca. I am Jacques. 

110
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,960
- Nice to meet you, Jacques. What are you doing? 
- I am looking for treasure! 

111
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,320
- Treasure? 
- Yes, gold and silver coins. 

112
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,280
The lost treasure of the Good Ship Neptune. 

113
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,440
Where? 

114
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,360
Down there somewhere. 

115
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,080
- Ooh! 
- You will come with me. Yes, we will dive deep in the sea. 
- Right. 

116
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,920
You will need a few things. Take this. 

117
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,040
Ooh, a watch, so I know how long I've been under for. 

118
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,720
- Here, take this. 
- Oh, a special underwater camera. 

119
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,320
- And here, take this. 
- A brown teddy bear? 

120
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,600
Oh, no! This is Brian. 

121
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,080
Brian stays on the boat. Brian, you stay there. 

122
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,280
Come, come, we shall dive deep into the sea and find the lost treasure 

123
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,080
of the Good Ship Neptune! 

124
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,880
- Oh, hooray! I'm ready. 
- And maybe... 
- Maybe what? 

125
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,000
- ..we will find the talking fish. 
- Eh? 

126
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,960
Come, come, let us go now. 

127
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,320
Here we go. 

128
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,400
Oh, wow, fish! 

129
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,880
And jellyfish! 

130
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,320
Starfish and seaweed. 

131
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,840
I'm under water. This is fantastic. 

132
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,080
Hold on, what's going on? 

133
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,960
I'm floating back up. 

134
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,880
How am I going to find the treasure? 

135
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,600
Hold on, I remember. Do you? 

136
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,560
Divers wear heavy weight belts 

137
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,400
to help them sink down as far as they want to go. 

138
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,440
I need a heavy weight belt. 

139
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,320
I wonder if Jacques has got one. But where's he gone? 

140
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,520
If I float back up, maybe he'll come and find me. 

141
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,880
Phew! That didn't last long. 

142
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,960
I want to go back. It was amazing down there. 

143
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,360
Rebecca, what is going on? Why did you come back up? 

144
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,080
- Do you not like it in the sea? 
- No, I mean, yes, it was lovely, amazing. 

145
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,240
- Great, come then, let's go. 
- No, hold on, wait. 
- What? 

146
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,080
I need a weight belt. You forgot to give me one. 

147
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,080
Oh, yes, of course, you need a weight belt to stay under the water. 

148
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,440
- Yes, I know. 
- Here we have one. 

149
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,720
Now, be very careful. 

150
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,360
And, yes, it is very heavy. Let me help you. Here we are. 

151
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,080
I will lift it up. That's it. 

152
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:26,080
Now you turn around slowly and put this inside the buckle like so 

153
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,560
and pull it nice and tight. 

154
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,120
- Ready? Voila! 
- Thank you. 

155
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,920
- Now come, let us go and find us some treasure. 
- Right. 
- Right. 

156
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,880
- Let us go this way. 
- OK. 

157
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,320
Wow, this is really amazing! 

158
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,720
I must take some pictures. 

159
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,040
Thank you. 

160
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,880
Wow! 

161
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,560
Hold on, Jacques, I'm taking pictures. 

162
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,320
Oh, no, an octopus! 

163
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,880
Hold on, I want to take your picture. 

164
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:29,240
Oh, it's very fast. Hey, hold on. Slow down, Mr Octopus! 

165
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,120
Oh, he's gone. Maybe that's where he lives. 

166
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,520
I'll go and take a look. I'd better just tell Jacques. 

167
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,640
Over here, Jacques. 

168
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,840
I'm going this way. 

169
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,440
Eh? Why is he tapping his head like that? Any idea? 

170
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,840
I can't understand him at all. 

171
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,720
Why is he waving his hand over his head? 

172
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,760
Oh, I remember. Do you? 

173
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,800
Divers talk to each other by using special hand signals. 

174
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,800
This means "OK". 

175
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,120
This means "octopus". 

176
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,600
And this means "shark". SHARK?! SHARK?! 

177
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,680
Oh, no, I've dropped the camera. Quick, let's swim into that boat. 

178
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,200
Phew, that was close. 

179
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,240
It's good to get out of the water. 

180
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,360
There's plenty of air to breathe in this air pocket but where are we? 

181
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,480
- Shark. 
- Looks like the inside of some kind of an old ship. 

182
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,240
Oh, and look, there's a picture on the wall. 

183
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,360
"The Good Ship Neptune." 

184
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,960
Hey, this is the treasure ship we've been looking for. 

185
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,080
The Good Ship Neptune! 

186
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,920
Jacques, get up. We've found the Good Ship Neptune! 

187
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,040
What? 

188
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,480
- The Good Ship Neptune? This is it? 
- Yes. 

189
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,160
If this is the Good Ship Neptune, you know what that means? 

190
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,920
- It means there must be treasure on it. 
- Come, we must find it. 

191
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,800
Ah, look. 

192
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,840
It must be around here somewhere. 

193
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,200
Usually they keep it in wooden boxes. 

194
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,680
- Heavy wooden boxes with handles on the side. 
- Like this, you mean? 

195
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,960
No, I was looking for... 

196
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,760
Yes, that is it! The treasure! We found the treasure. 

197
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,520
Oh, happy days. 

198
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:02,360
# We found the treasure We found the treasure. # 

199
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,800
Er, Jacques... 

200
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,040
- there's just old boots in here. 
- What? 

201
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,160
What? 

202
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,360
- Rebecca. 
- Yes. 

203
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,000
- This isn't treasure. 
- No. 

204
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,400
- Just old boots. 
- Yes. 

205
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,200
It doesn't look like we'll find any treasure today. 

206
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,000
Well, at least the shark has gone and we can go back to our boat. 

207
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,240
- Bye-bye, Good Ship Neptune. 
- Bye-bye. 

208
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,040
HE SOBS 

209
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,440
Oh, well, no treasure, 

210
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,840
but at least I got to see the lovely underwater things. Bye-bye, fish. 

211
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,400
Bye-bye, seaweed. 

212
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,360
Hello, Mr Octopus, it's you again. 

213
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,320
Oh, I think he wants me to follow him. 

214
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,600
Ah, this is a different part of the ship. Now, where did that octopus go? 

215
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,800
There he is and he's pointing over there. Maybe he's found something. 

216
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,840
The treasure! It's the treasure in another trunk! 

217
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,040
But I won't be able to get that out. There's too much stuff in the way. 

218
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,080
I must go and tell Jacques. 

219
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:37,120
Nothing but old boots. No treasure. Brian, Jacques is very sad. 

220
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,720
- Jacques, I found it, the treasure. 
- What? Where is it? 

221
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,400
- You have not got it? 
- No, it's still on the ship. I couldn't reach it. 

222
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,720
- It's stuck behind loads of old wood. 
- Oh, no. 

223
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,840
But tell people we found it and they can come back and get it out. 

224
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,320
They will never believe me. 

225
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,720
Ah, unless... 

226
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,160
- Unless what? 
- A picture. You can take a picture. 

227
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,320
Then I will show it to the people 

228
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,000
and they will help me take the treasure out. 

229
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,440
- Oh, yes! Oh, actually, no. 
- No? Why? 

230
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,840
- The camera - I dropped it when I saw the shark. 
- Oh, no! 

231
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,800
Oh, but I could go back and get it. 

232
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,560
- Yes! Yes, go, go, go. 
- OK. 

233
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,480
Treasure, Brian, treasure! 

234
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,160
Right, where's that camera? 

235
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,720
It must be down here somewhere. 

236
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,640
Oh, look, there it is. 

237
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,720
Now I just need to reach it. 

238
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,160
Hold on, those are anemones, so what do we need to know? 

239
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,680
Oh, I remember. Do you? 

240
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,880
Anemones have stinging tentacles that they pull in 

241
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,440
when things touch them so I'd better be careful. 

242
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,120
But how do I get them away from my camera? 

243
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,720
Oh, hold on, I can use my pointy metal stick thing. 

244
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,800
This should do the trick. 

245
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,680
Ooh! 

246
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,360
SHE LAUGHS 

247
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,920
Great. Got it. 

248
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,080
Now to get that picture. 

249
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,360
SHE LAUGHS 

250
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,200
Smile, Mr Octopus. 

251
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,880
Now we have proof that the treasure exists. Fantastic! 

252
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,240
Woo-hoo! 

253
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:54,280
- Here you go, Jacques. Look at the picture. 
- Ah, a treasure picture! 

254
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,200
I will show this to everyone 

255
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,840
and they will help me get the treasure out of the sea. 

256
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,120
Thank you, Rebecca. Thank you. 

257
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,040
We did it but we would never have managed it without remembering 

258
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,200
everything that we needed to know. 

259
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,800
Divers wear heavy weight belts 

260
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,760
to help them sink down as far as they want to go. 

261
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,520
They talk to each other by using special hand signals. 

262
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,160
And sea anemones have stinging tentacles that they pull in 

263
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,000
when things touch them. 

264
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,480
- I think it's time we went home. Bye, Jacques. 
- Goodbye, Rebecca. 

265
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,920
- Say goodbye now, Brian. 
- Let's go. 

266
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,320
- So this octopus swam away and I followed it and guess what. 
- What? 

267
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:56,080
- It led me to the treasure. 
- Wow! Now, that is what I call an adventure. 

268
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,280
- Beats what I was doing here. 
- So your picture-taking didn't work out? 

269
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,000
I still haven't found the right pose. Nothing exciting. 

270
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,200
Oh, well, not to worry, because... 

271
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,440
you know that shark I told you about? 

272
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,040
Yes, the one that came up behind you and gave you a surprise? 

273
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:16,160
Yes, because when I dropped the camera I had my finger on the button 

274
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,680
- because, as I let it go, it took a picture. 
- Yes. 
- I hope you like it. 

275
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,560
I put it in a frame for you. 

276
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:27,040
Oh, Rebecca, that is great and the picture is perfect for the frame. 

277
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,440
I'm glad you like it. Playing at being divers was great fun. 

278
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,000
What do you like to play? 

279
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,600
I like to play builders and build huge towers. 

280
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,240
Rugby playing is great fun. 

281
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,600
When I play rugby players I warm up like this. 

282
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,080
I like to play nurses and look after people. 

283
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,400
I use bandages like this. 

284
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,760
It's fun to play. Start playing today. 

285
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,280
Go to... 

286
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,920
..and click on Let's Play. See you soon.
