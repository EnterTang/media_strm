1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,350
前情提要

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,820
趴下! 所有人趴下!
Down! Everybody down!

3
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,750
解放组织洗劫那些保险柜
Liber8 is fishing for something specific

4
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:06,320
是为了寻找一样特别的东西
in those safety deposit boxes.

5
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:07,220
怎么回事?
What's happening?

6
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,960
首先 我打赌这是一个全新的战斗策略
First, I bet a whole new battle strategy.

7
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,690
一年来你一直秘密使用这张SIM卡?
You used the same secret SIM card for a year?

8
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,130
解放组织给我下了套...
Liber8 wanted me on the hook and...

9
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,360
省省吧 贝蒂
Save it, Betty.

10
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,100
我们要拿你做诱饵
We're going to use you as bait.

11
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,030
你真觉得他们肯乖乖的把你捧作
Did you really think they were gonna let you play Steve Jobs

12
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,270
史蒂夫·乔布斯吗?
without a fight?

13
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,640
你得跟他们硬碰硬才行
You need a shark to take on these sharks.

14
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:23,970
离艾力克远一点
Stay away from Alec.

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,200
哪一个艾力克?
Which one?

16
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,310
我猜咱们两个是没法做朋友了 对吗?
So I guess we're not gonna be pals then, huh?

17
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,340
我也这样想
I don't see how.

18
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,820
别忘记做作业 帝奥
Don't forget to do your homework, Tio.

19
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,990
妈妈 我讨厌算分数
Mom, I hate fractions.

20
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,960
我也是 但你不练习考试就会不及格
So did I, but you won't pass your exams without them.

21
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,430
帝奥 我不是叫你把门关上了吗?
Tio, I thought I told you to close the door?

22
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,500
爹地!
Daddy!

23
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,340
嘿!
Hey!

24
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,840
我想死你了!
I missed you so much!

25
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,910
你去哪儿了?
Where have you been?

26
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,880
我的生日你都错过了
You missed my birthday.

27
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,250
我也不想的 宝贝
I didn't want to, baby.

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,380
嘿!
Hey!

29
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,420
爹地不应该回来的
Daddy knows he shouldn't be here.

30
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,920
我们说过的安全第一
We talked about staying safe.

31
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,620
我另有办法
I have another way.

32
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,330
去玩吧 去
Go play. Go.

33
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,600
她的DNA是伪造的
Her DNA is forged.

34
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,200
万一被发现是你这种人的女儿...
If they find out that she's the daughter of a..

35
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,330
哪种人? 逃亡者?
A fugitive?

36
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,400
恐怖分子?
A terrorist?

37
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,500
你不会真的相信吧
You don't believe that.

38
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,540
我怎么想又没有用
It doesn't matter what I believe.

39
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:35,810
当我无比渴望跟你们相聚的时候
Belief is the only thing that keeps me going

40
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,940
信念是唯一支撑我走下去的力量
when I'm dying to be with you both.

41
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,780
我是说 帝奥需要知道信念是...
I mean, Tio needs to learn that belief is...

42
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:48,120
当你偷听别人说话时信念就会是个问题!
belief is only a problem when you're eavesdropping!

43
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,150
让你尝尝我的厉害!
Because this is what happens!

44
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,480
去右边!!!
To the right!!

45
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,710
右边!!!
On the right!!!

46
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,280
进去 进去!!!
In, in, in!!!!

47
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,380
那边有人
There.

48
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,650
搜查完毕
Clear.

49
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,250
没有发现 长官
All clear sir.

50
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,370
这儿仍然残留着他的信息素
His pheromone levels are still ambient.

51
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,610
为了自己着想 你们两个说实话吧
It's better for the both of you if you were to tell the truth.

52
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,810
你们跟他有什么关系?
What's your connection to him?

53
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:52,650
你搞错了
Please.

54
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,280
他刚刚还威胁要杀了我们
He threatened to kill us.

55
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,650
我们都是好公民
We're good citizens.

56
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,350
忠于国家
We're loyal.

57
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,130
那你呢 小甜心?
And what about you, sweetheart?

58
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,130
你忠于企业集团议会吗?
Are you loyal to the corporate congress?

59
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,030
我已经在学校立过誓言了
I took the oath in school.

60
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:16,400
你不希望妈妈有麻烦吧 对不对?
You want to help your mother out, don't you?

61
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,270
那就说实话 他去哪儿了?
So tell me, where did he go?

62
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:37,990
贝尔塔 下来吧
Verta, down.

63
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,890
立刻
Now.

64
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,100
瞄准他了!
I got him!

65
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,170
下来
Get down.

66
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,240
快点下来!!!
Get down now!!!

67
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,610
慢点
Easy.

68
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,010
跪下!
Down on your knees!

69
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,020
超越时间线 第三季第五集 三十分钟直播

70
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,100
照片标签上就写
Hash-tag

71
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,390
"亲我的屁屁 弗门塔斯"怎么样?
"kiss my ass Fermitas"?

72
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,020
经典!
Epic!

73
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,020
弗门塔斯 助纣为虐

74
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,480
这公司的保安干什么吃的
The corporate security was primitive at best.

75
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,810
那些抗议者应该连大厅
Those protesters never should have made it

76
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,080
都进不去才对
past the lobby.

77
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,150
他们为什么瞄准弗门塔斯?
Why paint a bullseye on Fermitas?

78
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,520
你的用词还真是讽刺啊
Well, that's an ironic choice of words.

79
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,190
弗门塔斯是世界上最大的军火制造商之一
Fermitas is one of the world's largest weapons manufacturers,

80
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,030
就像军火界的沃尔玛
like the Wal-Mart for warlords.

81
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,390
你在跟这个案子吗?
You chasing this one down?

82
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,230
非法入室和示威抗议?
Trespassing and opinionated protests?

83
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,360
还真不是我的工作范围
It's not really my department.

84
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,730
在我看来是解放组织的煽动行为
It seems to me like Liber8's recruiting methods

85
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,670
终于起作用了
are paying off.

86
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,500
非暴力抗议早在你的朋友
Civil disobedience has been around

87
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,470
出现之前就有了
long before your friends showed up.

88
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,740
卡洛斯?
Carlos?

89
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,350
我们都是长途跋涉走到今天
We've both travelled long distances,

90
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:26,120
见过很多他人闻所未闻的事情
seen things other people can't know or understand.

91
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,290
我们可以互相帮助
We could help each other.

92
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,690
我们已经是一路人马了 你还想怎样?
We're already on the same team, what more do you want?

93
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,100
每个人都需要伙伴
Everyone needs a partner.

94
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,330
卡洛斯和艾力克...
Carlos, Alec...

95
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,200
你们的友谊正在分崩离析
Those relationships are fracturing.

96
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,700
凯瑟琳知道你来找我吗?
Does Katherine know you're here?

97
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,070
是她要我关照你的
She asked me to keep an eye on you.

98
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:48,610
这可算不上是个回答
That is not an answer.

99
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,910
也许他只是在向你表示善意
It's possible his offer was a gesture of goodwill.

100
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,950
他的字典里可没有"善意"这个词
Goodwill is not in his arsenal.

101
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,580
我不信任他
I don't trust him.

102
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,890
他知道我敬重你 也知道我们有交流
Well, he knows I respect you and he knows we talk,

103
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,720
也许他的动机就是这么简单
so maybe that's all it is.

104
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,030
但你能告诉我这些我很感激
I appreciate you telling me, though.

105
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,830
这里的大部分人都没有家人
Most of the people in this cell don't have families.

106
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,530
他们在传统社会中没有立足之地
They found themselves lost in traditional society.

107
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,330
其中一些是我从街上收进来的
Some I recruited off the streets,

108
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,070
其他的则是主动投奔而来
others found their way to me.

109
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,100
他们中的很多人都缺乏母爱
For many of them, mother-less.

110
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,310
我填补了这个角色
I can fulfil that roll.

111
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,880
你对当前的局势怎么看?
How do things feel to you?

112
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:29,850
解放组织自从银行抢劫案之后就悄无声息
Liber8 has been quiet since the bank robberies.

113
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,190
各方势力也没有动静
All that energy in theatre to little or no effect.

114
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,220
你也有这样的感觉?
You feel that?

115
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,560
某种程度上是的
In a way.

116
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,020
你不也是吗?
Don't you?

117
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,630
那里面是什么?
What's in there?

118
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:53,140
很高兴你来了
I'm glad you're here.

119
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,590
好吧 如果我不接
Okay, if I don't answer this,

120
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,990
卢卡斯会起疑心的
Lucas is going to wonder why.

121
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,760
你觉得我会蠢到让你给他
You think I'm gonna let you send him some kind of message

122
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:09,930
通风报信吗?
by the way you answer?

123
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,960
不许接
No.

124
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,660
我会按你们的要求接电话
I will answer it any way you want.

125
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,070
他不常打电话给我的
He doesn't call that often.

126
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,830
我说过了不行
I said no.

127
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,940
如果她是对的怎么办?
What if she's right?

128
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:24,210
我们来决定什么时候拿她当诱饵
We'll pick the moment to use her to our advantage.

129
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,140
按我们的方式
On our terms.

130
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,380
嘿 你去哪儿了?
Hey, where've you been?

131
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,920
碰到了一个老朋友
I ran into an old friend.

132
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,750
有意思 我都不知道你还有老朋友
Funny, I wasn't aware you had any of those.

133
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,490
怎么回事?
What is it?

134
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,600
这个地方从来都不能消停一下
This department just can't catch a break.

135
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,530
强行入室罪
Break and enter.

136
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,200
非法侵入罪
Criminal trespass.

137
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,700
怠忽致危罪
Reckless endangerment.

138
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,140
直接叫我恐怖分子好了
Just call me a terrorist.

139
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,510
反正在你眼里都是一个样
That's what we all are to you.

140
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,060
当着两位证人
This is being recorded

141
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,940
卡梅伦探员和福乃格探长的面
in front of two witnesses,

142
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,680
以下对话将记录在案
Agent Cameron and Detective Fonnegra.

143
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,480
我确定你刚才的话只是讽刺 无其他含义
I will stipulate that you were being sarcastic just then.

144
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,850
视网膜扫描 心跳正常
不要再犯这样的错误
Don't repeat that mistake.

145
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,020
接下来 继续记录再案
Now, for the record,

146
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,620
你已经了解了你的权利
you've already been advised of your rights.

147
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,920
我们的行为是无害的
What we did was harmless.

148
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,130
没有人受伤
Nobody got hurt.

149
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,690
你的所作所为已经够得上起诉了
What you did is an indictable offense!

150
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,730
那是要坐牢的
You could serve time.

151
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,100
现在我想知道为什么
Now I want to know why.

152
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,590
狮门大学被血洗之后
Do I really have to say it

153
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,670
原因不是显而易见吗?
after the bloodbath at LGU?

154
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,270
我是在表明立场
I'm taking a stand.

155
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,840
那次射杀 还有之后你的做法...
That shooting, your tactics...

156
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,900
用于应对威胁是必要 且适度的
Were necessary and proportionate to the threat.

157
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,780
告诉我你要请律师
Tell me you want a lawyer.

158
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,250
不是吧 老爸
You can't be serious, dad.

159
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,780
克里斯汀 我只能帮你到这儿了
Christine, this is as far as I am willing to stretch.

160
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,490
现在 快说
Now, say the words.

161
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,930
给我找个律师
I want a lawyer.

162
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,270
好吧 刚才那一幕我们可没有办法完全
Well, we're not going to be able to sweep that one

163
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,500
隐瞒过去
under the rug.

164
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,100
如果她免于被起诉的话 他和整个部门都会被
If she isn't charged, it puts him and the whole department

165
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,670
都将被推上风口浪尖
under a microscope.

166
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,780
这又不是她一个人做的
She didn't do this on her own.

167
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,910
哦 没错啊 他们都有罪哦
Oh yeah, sure, they're both guilty.

168
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,110
但是其他孩子不会上头条
But that other kid's not gonna lead the news.

169
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,780
他们才会
They are.

170
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,220
不管怎么运作 这都是一个两败俱伤的结果
This is lose-lose any way you play it.

171
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,890
我觉得你还少说了一个
I think you're one "lose" short.

172
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,190
我是不是需要个工会代表?
Do I need my union rep?

173
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,160
这又不是在审问你 杰克
There's no inquisition here, Jack.

174
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:28,200
是还没...
Yet...

175
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,200
你女儿支持解放组织
You're daughter is pro Liber8.

176
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,470
你认为这事会怎样?
How do you think that looks?

177
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,970
听你的意思 是不是又要逼我辞职了?
Is this the part where I clear out my desk again?

178
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,470
我监督你的工作
Just because I'm your oversight

179
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,240
并不代表我不支持你的工作
doesn't mean I'm not your advocate.

180
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,940
你知道是谁在资助我
You know who I'm funded by.

181
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,180
很了解
Intimately.

182
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:47,010
那你就应该清楚我这次可没有那么容易就被挤走
Then you realize I won't be removed as easily as last time.

183
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,680
在这件事儿上 我们有可以合作的空间
I think that there's room for cooperation.

184
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,720
我们互利互惠嘛
Every back needs scratching.

185
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,190
你现在有什么主意吗?
What did you have in mind?

186
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,190
引导舆论
Spin.

187
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,080
这事儿我帮不了她
I can't save her from this.

188
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,010
不行?
Can't?

189
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,680
让别的部门来处理
Kick it over to another department.

190
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,110
让特里来做
Let Terry handle it.

191
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,280
他欠你的
He owes you.

192
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,020
或者布拉特 那次你放他儿子回家
Or Brett, for that time you took his son home

193
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,280
没有带回警署
instead of the precinct.

194
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,450
她肯定会上头条的 尼基
She's gonna lead the news, Niky.

195
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,590
我所能做的就是把她和其他孩子一样看待
The only thing I can do is treat her like any other kid.

196
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,560
那不一样!
She's not!

197
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,790
必须这样
She has to be.

198
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,930
你会毁了她的未来的
This will destroy her future.

199
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,360
是她自己的选择
She made a choice.

200
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,430
五年前你也是如此
Same way you did five years ago.

201
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,800
我们要聊的不是这个!
That is not what we're talking about!

202
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,040
你知道吗 以前的你是认可我的原则的
You know, there was a time when you believed in my principles.

203
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,310
那时候的你还相信原则的
There was a time you believed in them, too.

204
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,170
我现在也是
I still do.

205
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,680
克里斯必将被追究责任的
Chrissy will be held accountable.

206
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,920
现在到了这一步
While we're at it,

207
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,250
我想要创建一个二阶认证协议
I'd like to create a two-stage authentication protocol

208
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,220
以便于日后有任何变动
for any future changes.

209
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,190
好的 我可以等
Sure, I can hold.

210
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,690
赛德科技 重新设置主密码?

211
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:19,400
哦 真是摇身一变啊
Oh, wardrobe upgrade I see.

212
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,640
帅啊
Sharp.

213
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,410
提升自我呗
I'm evolving.

214
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,770
董事会的事情处理的不赖 小伙子
You did great with that board, kid.

215
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,140
你独自一人和罪恶进行抗争
You held your own against the vipers.

216
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,580
现在你需要找一个正义的小伙伴
Now you need to bring in a mongoose.

217
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,150
上次你还用鲨鱼做比来着
Last time it was a shark.

218
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,280
随意啦
Whatever.

219
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,720
找一个可以为了你而战斗的伙伴
Someone who can strike on your behalf.

220
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,890
要是你想选我的话...
If that happens to be me...

221
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,090
那个 这个事儿吧
Uh, well, the thing is,

222
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,490
既然现在和董事会那边没什么纷争了
while things settle down with the board,

223
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,030
我们也就不要再招聘什么人了
we're in a bit of a hiring freeze.

224
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,900
现在...
Now...

225
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,670
你可不要忘了是我不就之前把你从零售店的
You may remember I rescued you from a menial job

226
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:59,540
粗活儿里解救出来的
at a retail store not too long ago.

227
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,810
我让你重新回归正轨
I gave you back your destiny.

228
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,990
我们说好了的
We had a deal.

229
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,560
你这样可不对啊
And this wasn't it.

230
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,290
哦 歇歇吧
Oh, come on.

231
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:20,700
你还可以再找到一个可以利用的技术宅男的
You'll find another tech-savy kid to profit by.

232
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,200
我不是独一无二的 你我都心知肚明
We both know that I'm not unique.

233
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,370
你在逗我?
You're kidding me?

234
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,640
你他妈的可是能创造未来的人啊
You're the damn architect of the future.

235
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,480
按照目前赛德科技发展来看
As far as Sadtech goes,

236
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:37,280
我为你准备好了一份合理的赔偿
I'm prepared to offer you a reasonable settlement.

237
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,180
你准备好了
You're prepared.

238
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,120
你还真是准备好了
You're prepared!

239
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:46,420
你是个不错的老师
You were a good teacher.

240
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,490
哦
Whooo.

241
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,430
哦 这可不能就这么算了
Oh, this is not how it ends.

242
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,290
好吧 你有别的方案再来找我
Well, let me know when you find an alternative.

243
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,730
你最近在读那本关于管理的书
You've been reading that book on management.

244
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,600
叫什么来着
What's the name?

245
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,870
我没有...
I haven't...

246
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,170
"沉默的力量"...
The "power in silence"...

247
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,470
不提出质疑 只陈述看法
No, no questions where a statement will do,

248
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,800
用法律手段制裁你的敌人
roll over your enemies with legal power.

249
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,170
见鬼 你知道那个作者
Hell, you know the author.

250
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,210
我不认识
I don't.

251
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,510
你就是那个作者
It's you, kid.

252
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,110
就是你
It's you.

253
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,500
感谢你们部门能提供给我们这次机会
I'm glad your department offered me this opportunity.

254
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,140
你是实权人物 我们节目确实需要更多你这样的人
You're a take-charge guy and we definitely need more of those,

255
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,000
尤其是现在市长更替如此频繁的情况下
especially with our revolving door of mayors.

256
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,870
最近简直就像七个小矮人轮番上场一样
It's like the seven dwarfs lately.

257
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,040
同感 开心果和糊涂蛋已经完蛋了
Yeah, happy and dopey are dead,

258
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,040
我觉得现在台上的是爱生气
I think grumpy's in charge now.

259
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,380
有趣的说法 这是个亮点
Funny, that's a bonus.

260
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,220
别太担心 我们不会咄咄逼人
And don't worry, we'll go easy.

261
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,650
我看过你的节目 博尔顿小姐
I've seen your show, miss Bolton.

262
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,090
你从来都是咄咄逼人
You don't do easy.

263
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,850
别让奈杰尔打乱你的思路
Don't let Nigel interrupt you,

264
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,090
他有时候是很难容忍
he can be insufferable at times.

265
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,530
但制片人说 我不能老是孤立他
But my producer says I have to stop cutting him off so much

266
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,430
因为...其实我也不懂
because... I don't know.

267
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,830
男权社会吧
The patriarchy.

268
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,160
奈杰尔我应付得了
I'm sure I can handle Nigel.

269
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,200
我就是喜欢警察的这个范儿
I do love cops.

270
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:16,010
观点交锋
您将不会把您的女儿和其他孩子区别对待
Your daughter will be treated just like any other kid.

271
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,410
奈杰尔 你觉得这可能吗?
Nigel, can you believe this?

272
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,240
当然不可能了
No, absolutely not.

273
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,010
狄龙警官只有对企业集团的大佬们
Inspector Dillon is answerable

274
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,550
才会表现出负责的态度
only to his corporate overlords,

275
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,220
他才不会对公民 对这座城市负责
certainly not the people and not the city.

276
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,350
现在的问题是我的女儿需要对谁负责
This is about who my daughter answers to.

277
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,920
她的行为很严重 一定会被起诉
It's a serious offense and she will be held accountable.

278
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,320
是初犯吧?
A first offense?

279
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,060
换做任何一个父母都会想方设法
Any parent can understand wanting to use whatever

280
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,360
利用任何可能...
influence they could...

281
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,830
戴安娜 我不像普通家长
Diana, I don't get to be any parent.

282
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,860
我的责任是二十四小时全天候的
My accountability is 24/7.

283
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,230
而且 很不幸 对我女儿来讲 由于血缘关系
And, unfortunately for my daughter, by association,

284
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,500
她的也是
hers is too.

285
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:44,070
在你的职责之下已经出现过丑闻 警方掩盖真相
Under your accountability we've had scandals, police cover-ups

286
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,570
两位市长身亡这样的事情
and two dead mayors.

287
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,270
警长 你说说看
Inspector, tell us:

288
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,600
如果你不是警察 你女儿现在的情况
How would your daughter's situation

289
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,710
会出现多大的改观吗?
play out different if you weren't a cop?

290
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,410
如果我不是警察?
If I wasn't a cop?

291
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,010
那就没什么可讲的了 对吧?
There wouldn't be a story, would there?

292
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,440
所以你打算将为非作歹的女儿
So you're gonna let the system

293
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,610
直接移交司法部门处理?
take care of your miscreant daughter?

294
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,880
法律系统就是这样运作的 没错
That's how the justice system works, yes.

295
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,380
那这是否也适用于你的私人警备枪杀
Does that include your own private police

296
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,190
无辜的大学生呢?
shooting innocent university students?

297
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,620
你现在竟然还没下台
And you're still in charge.

298
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,700
如果我们不让这样的
If we can't remove

299
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,330
所谓的管理者下台的话 戴安娜
our so-called leaders, Diana,

300
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,490
就是放任法西斯主义
we're staring fascism in the face.

301
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,230
您是法西斯吗 长官?
Are you a fascist, inspector?

302
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,330
在奈杰尔的眼中 我就是个公司的走狗而已
According to Nigel, I'm a corporate lackey.

303
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,700
但我觉得这两种形象有点矛盾
It seems contradictory to me.

304
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,770
问得好
Excellent question.

305
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,080
比平时有进步啊
That was better than usual.

306
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,850
切断信号
Kill the feed.

307
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,300
他们堵住了大门 在门上安了炸药
They blocked and booby-trapped the doors.

308
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,740
大部分员工都被赶出来了
Most of the staff were forced out

309
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,410
里面还有狄龙局长和其他八个人质
except for inspector Dillon and eight other hostages.

310
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,570
有几个解放组织的成员?
How many Liber8?

311
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:45,480
不清楚 不过有人认出了特拉维斯·贝尔塔
Unknown, but witnesses identified both Travis Verta

312
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,280
和卢卡斯·英格拉姆
and Lucas Ingram.

313
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,850
好的
ok.

314
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,510
我们先想办法跟他们谈判吧
We try and talk them out first.

315
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,220
同时 再计划下应该怎么进去
In the meantime, get us an entry plan.

316
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,090
要进去很简单 但是他们一定知道
Easy enough to get in, but they had to know

317
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,490
想要出来几乎是不可能
it would be virtually impossible to get out.

318
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,420
你的内线最近很安静啊
Your contact's gone quiet.

319
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,190
没有她我们能行吗?
Can we still do this without her?

320
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,130
别担心 我会有办法的
Trust me, I'll find a way.

321
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:11,240
其实我们都知道现在的状况
We know how this plays.

322
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,940
你们的人在外面一边封锁街道
Your troops are outside shutting down streets,

323
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:17,140
一边想方设法找其他的入口
searching for entries into the building from above and below.

324
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,710
你在每个入口都安装了炸弹
You've wired all entries to blow,

325
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,840
你早就盘算好了谈判条件
you've got a list of demands,

326
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,380
你也知道我们是不会搭理你的
you know we're not gonna meet them.

327
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,280
如果外面是福乃格在负责的话
And, if your boy Fonnegra is in charge,

328
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,550
他会知道 我们来不是为了抢一大笔钱
he knows we're not in this to steal a million

329
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,150
然后逃到玻利维亚去的
and fly off to Bolivia.

330
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:31,750
那你想要什么?
So what is it you want?

331
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,560
很快你就会知道了
You're about to find out.

332
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,100
哪位
Yes.

333
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,710
取款遭拒 请联络当地银行

334
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,510
是他
It's him.

335
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,710
我什么时候变的这么混蛋了?
When did I become such a dick?

336
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,870
别开玩笑
It's not a joke.

337
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:52,910
我没开玩笑
I'm not joking.

338
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,480
但是...
But he's still...

339
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,680
你就是他 他就是你
You're him, he's you.

340
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:59,020
他怎么可以这么狠?
How can he be so vindictive?

341
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,450
你就不会这样
I don't see that in you.

342
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,020
我成功穿越时空
I travelled through time, win.

343
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:04,290
也成功赢得心爱的女孩 他有理由恨我
I got the girl, win.

344
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,120
你失去了你的爸爸
You lost your father.

345
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,460
对 但是我不像另一个我反应那么大
Yeah, but I'm not like the other me there.

346
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,630
我见过艾舍尔 我一点也不喜欢他
I met the guy, I didn't like him.

347
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,230
不管怎么说 艾舍尔还是你爸爸
Escher was still your father.

348
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,030
没法父子相认 总会有些遗憾
There's gotta be some regret not knowing him.

349
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,600
遗憾什么的以后再说吧
I'll try on some regret later.

350
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,030
现在我们没空管这事
Right now we've got other problems.

351
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,940
在他们杀害人质前
Ok, we've got 30 minutes to give them access

352
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,370
我们还有三十分钟的时间
to the station's satellite network

353
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,270
为他们拿到卫星代码
before they start killing hostages.

354
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,980
他还想来一次直播演讲
And he wants to make a public address.

355
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,340
这没道理啊
It doesn't make sense.

356
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,750
过去 当卡加梅和卢卡斯想要宣传他们的理念
In the past, when Kagame and Lucas wanted to reach people

357
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,610
他们会直接黑电脑
they simply hacked in.

358
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,090
为什么现在还要来玩挟持人质
Why take hostages and

359
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,320
这样会暴露自己的把戏?
expose themselves like this?

360
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,920
不知道
I don't know.

361
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,320
我们是不可能让他们做什么直播的
And we're never going to let them broadcast anything.

362
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,920
这里有个维护面板
There's a maintenance panel here

363
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,490
是通到排气管那里去的
that leads to the ventilation gangway.

364
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,860
我们可以派几个人进去
We could send in a small team,

365
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,590
为大部队进入打开通道
secure access for a larger force.

366
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,430
我们不是应该先谈判吗?
Shouldn't we start with negotiation?

367
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,000
特拉维斯是不会和你达成协议的
Travis is never gonna cut a deal.

368
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,830
我们可以先通过谈判把狄龙救出来
We negotiate for Dillon.

369
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:54,170
人质是不分三六九等的
There are no VIP's in a hostage situation.

370
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,540
如果是我在里面 狄龙在外面负责解救人质
If I was in there and Dillon was out here,

371
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:58,570
他会跟我做一样的决定的
he would make exactly the same call.

372
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,410
让电力公司伪造一个变压器故障
Have hydro stage a transformer failure,

373
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,480
告诉他们因为这个原因不能直播
tell them that's why they're off the air.

374
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,840
这个说法骗不了他们多长时间
It won't convince them for long.

375
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,850
我们也不需要多长时间
We don't need that long,

376
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,480
够你们找到入口就行了
just long enough for you to export this entry.

377
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,650
带两个人 摸清状况
Take two guys, see what you can find.

378
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,480
你也要进去
You're going in there also.

379
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,250
跟他们一起?
With them?

380
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,250
不
No.

381
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,860
用你的方式进去 好吗?
Do that thing that you do, ok?

382
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,020
随时保持联系
Keep a line open for me.

383
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,600
琪拉
Kiera.

384
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,100
我们要救的是所有的人质
We want to rescue all of them.

385
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:28,170
知道了
I know.

386
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,740
现在有两个人已经...
We have a two man team...

387
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,180
看来好戏已经开始了
They're starting to play their games.

388
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,310
没事 我临时找了个备用电源
It doesn't matter, I rigged a back-up circuit.

389
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:44,580
马上就好 三 二 一
It should activate in three... two... one.

390
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,450
在我们得到卫星系统的代码之前
It's the only magic trick I've got

391
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,590
我只能做到这一步了
until we get those satellite codes.

392
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,460
今天对你来说真的很忙啊
Busy day for you.

393
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:02,500
逮捕你自己的女儿 在电视节目上道貌岸然
Arrest your own daughter, act the righteous man on TV,

394
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,400
现在又被当人质给抓起来了
get taken hostage.

395
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,440
晚上的运气有点不好
Tonight can only be a let down.

396
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,840
你到底想要什么?
What do you want?

397
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,310
你觉得我想要什么?
What do you think I want?

398
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,820
你一直想抓住我
You've been chasing me long enough.

399
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,150
你喜欢扯一大堆解放人民的鬼话
You know, you talk a great game about freeing the people,

400
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,190
但一到你身上
but it's on your terms.

401
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,660
要是有人跟你意见不合...
Anybody who doesn't agree with you...

402
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,690
就会被老爸抓起来
Ends up being arrested by daddy.

403
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,970
你当不了英雄 局长
You're not that guy, inspector.

404
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,110
你拿不到那把枪的 也无法扭转局势
You're not getting the gun, you're not saving the day.

405
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,010
看来你很自信啊?
Pretty confident in that, are you?

406
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,180
我是很自信
I am.

407
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,610
很好
Great.

408
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,950
福乃格最好能给我想要的东西
Your boy Fonnegra better get me what I want.

409
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,080
我十分赞同你的想法 贝尔塔先生
I'm in agreement with your principles, Mr. Verta.

410
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,150
要限制正在增长的公司企业的权力
Strip the power away from this growing corporate mono-culture.

411
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,890
闭嘴  奈杰尔 别乱说话
Shut up, Nigel, you're encouraging a terrorist!

412
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,360
只有解放组织看清了 如果我们不反抗
Liber8 has the only clear vision of what lies ahead

413
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,330
未来的下场会怎样
if we don't speak up.

414
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,330
贝尔塔先生和他的朋友们
Mr. Verta and his friends here

415
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,090
就是未来唯一的希望
are the only hope for the future.

416
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,140
别再乱说话
No more talking heads.

417
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,040
别担心 死不了
Oh, he'll live.

418
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,710
还能坚持一会儿
For a while.

419
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,480
你们肯定很想去帮他止血吧
You might want to block up that hole.

420
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,080
你别动
Not you.

421
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,870
当我看你的节目的时候
When I watch your show,

422
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,620
我真为你感到羞愧
I'm ashamed for you.

423
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:31,590
为你的观众感到羞愧
For all your viewers.

424
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,990
没有思想 没有分析
No awareness, no analysis,

425
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:37,160
有的只是些翻动言论
just reactionary opinions.

426
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,960
节目做成这样 你也有责任
You are part of the problem.

427
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,700
不过你只是一个漂亮的傀儡罢了
A pretty, empty puppet.

428
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,700
只会带着一群人嬉笑作乐
Leading everyone on a merry dance.

429
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,980
告诉福乃格他没有多少时间了
Tell Fonnegra he doesn't have much time.

430
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,980
特拉维斯?
Travis?

431
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,200
所有人质都还活着吗?
Are all the hostages still alive?

432
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,340
是的 但是时间不多了
For now, but the clock is ticking.

433
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:32,280
十五分钟之内给我接通卫星服务
Full access to those satellites in 15 minutes

434
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:35,710
不然我就杀了博尔顿小姐 表明下我的决心
or I'll shoot Miss Bolton next as a sign of my resolve.

435
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,520
特拉维斯 我们在解决你代码的事
Travis, we're working on getting you the codes,

436
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,520
但是这需要一点时间
but it's slow going.

437
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,820
公司不愿意交出代码
The company doesn't want to give them up.

438
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:43,750
别跟我来谈判这一套 福乃格
Save the negotiator clich, Fonnegra.

439
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:47,120
拖延战术只会导致
Stalling is only going to lead to something...

440
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,360
无法挽回的结果
Terminal.

441
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,930
喂
Yeah.

442
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,430
我进来了
I'm in.

443
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,400
很好
Alright, good.

444
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,940
随时跟我联系
Keep me apprise step by step.

445
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:02,270
知道了
Roger that.

446
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,410
我想我知道为什么电视台
I think I know why the network

447
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,670
不把卫星交出来
isn't releasing access to the satellites.

448
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:09,310
2010年整个公司已经被弗门塔斯公司买下了
That whole conglomerate was bought out in 2010 by Fermitas.

449
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,180
第一频道被军火商买下了?
The weapons-maker owns Channel 1?

450
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,620
戴安娜·博尔顿几年前曾经
Diana Bolton ran a huge expose on Fermitas

451
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:15,320
要曝光弗门塔斯的内幕
a couple years ago.

452
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,420
弗门塔斯声称要控告她
Fermitas announced an intention to sue,

453
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:18,820
之后又不告了
then dropped the suit.

454
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,490
人们当时以为是因为赢不了
People figured it was because it wasn't winnable,

455
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,720
但是事实是
but really...

456
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,130
如果你不能封锁媒体 就把它们买下来
If you can't muzzle the press, you buy them.

457
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,290
将其私下收购
Private acquisition.

458
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,100
私下收购?
Private acquisition?

459
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,460
这么说没人知道?
So nobody knows?

460
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,670
卢卡斯也许知道了
Lucas might have found out.

461
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,700
是吗?
Did he?

462
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,000
不是我告诉他的 我发誓
Not from me, I swear it.

463
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,210
你现在在哪呢?
What's your twenty?

464
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,610
监控室 看特拉维斯和卢卡斯在楼里扫荡呢
Security room, watching Travis and Lucas storm the castle.

465
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:46,080
所有这一切就为了在电视上播出他们的宣言?
All this effort to broadcast a manifesto?

466
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,980
嗯 这还有条爆炸新闻等着你呢
Well, here's some breaking news for ya.

467
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,420
弗门塔斯是这家电视台的幕后老板
Fermitas owns the station.

468
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,850
私人收购买卖
Private buying private.

469
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,450
那些保险箱
The safety deposit boxes.

470
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:56,390
解放组织就是这么发现这笔交易的
That's how Liber8 found out about the sale.

471
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,290
加尔萨和索尼娅不在
Garza and Sonya aren't here.

472
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,990
什么 兵分两路 分头进攻?
What, two-prong attack?

473
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:00,900
有道理
Makes sense.

474
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:01,760
卡洛斯?
Carlos?

475
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,300
保持联系
Stay in touch.

476
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:04,600
我们遇到问题了
We have a problem.

477
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,200
我的人已经进去了但是到演播室的
My men are inside but access to the studio

478
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:08,170
门被装上了炸药
is rigged with explosives.

479
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,370
拆弹小组呢?
Bomb squad?

480
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,500
我们从来没见过这种东西
We've never seen anything like this.

481
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,170
长官 企业集团代表来了
Sir, the corporate rep is here.

482
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:15,310
稍等我一下
Give me a second.

483
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,480
你是本尼迪克特?
You Benedict?

484
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,750
是的
Yes.

485
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,650
弗门塔斯的?
Fermitas?

486
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,380
是的
Yes.

487
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,420
太好了
Good.

488
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:24,650
他们已经枪伤了一人除非我们能满足
One man has been shot and there will be others

489
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:27,590
解放组织的部分要求 否则其他人也有危险了
unless we give Liber8 at least part of what they demanded.

490
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,920
恐怖组织想要连接电视台卫星的代码
Terrorists want the codes to the station's satellite.

491
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,130
抱歉 警探 但是公司有着严格的规定
Detective, I'm sorry, that company has a strict policy

492
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,230
禁止和恐怖分子谈判
against negotiating with terrorists.

493
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:39,000
所以你非常高兴能成为谋杀犯的帮凶?
So you're perfectly content with being accomplices to murder?

494
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:42,440
这家电视台也是弗门塔斯的 是不是?
That is Fermitas's business, isn't it?

495
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:45,140
我不想浪费你的时间
I don't want to waste your time.

496
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:50,110
解放组织至少拿到了弗门塔斯的一个保险箱
Liber8 emptied at least one Fermitas safety deposit box.

497
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,310
这也许是你们把里面的情报
This could be an opportunity

498
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,350
拿回来的好机会
for you to retrieve that information.

499
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:56,180
否则 不论里面是什么
Otherwise, Liber8 still has

500
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:59,490
东西依然掌握在解放组织手里
whatever it is that you lost,

501
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,890
而他们会好好利用的
and they will use it.

502
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,660
就好像在下鱼饵一样
It's like baiting a hook.

503
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:11,160
是啊 我们有麻烦了 他们不会善罢甘休的
Yeah, we got a problem, they're not gonna go for it.

504
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:37,820
把我留下放其他人走
You keep me as collateral and everybody else walks.

505
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,820
锁定目标

506
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,660
不可能
No deal.

507
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:57,640
局长 你觉得接下来会怎样?
What do you think happens next, inspector?

508
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,090
特拉维斯 出什么事情了?
What's happening, Travis?

509
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,460
不是什么好事
Nothing good.

510
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,290
卫星
The satellite.

511
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:15,930
你可以用了
You have access.

512
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:21,200
转发器的代码正在发给你
Transponder codes are being fed to you now.

513
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,600
谎言中的又一天
Live to lie another day.

514
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,510
你没事吧?
You ok?

515
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,320
不 我感觉很不好
No, I'm not.

516
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:41,920
我甚至在为奈杰尔感到难过
I even feel badly for Nigel.

517
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:44,290
所以我知道我现在糟糕透了
That's how I know I'm a wreck.

518
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,490
好了
Good to go.

519
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,760
重新设置卫星需要二十分钟
Re-tasking the satellite will take 20 minutes.

520
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:59,000
准备直播 三 二 ...
We're live in three... Two...

521
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:05,040
你们中的很多人觉得认识我
Most of you think you know me.

522
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,710
特拉维斯·贝尔塔
Travis Verta.

523
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,010
解放组织
Liber8.

524
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,410
杀人犯
Killer.

525
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:10,850
恐怖分子
Terrorist.

526
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,610
疯子
Lunatic.

527
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:16,990
现我又在这打断你们的节目
And now here I am, interrupting your programming.

528
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:21,220
这样的节目必须被打断
That's some programming that needs to be interrupted.

529
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:25,490
我们过去拥有的公司 现在拥有了我们
Companies we used to own, own us.

530
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:28,800
以前我们选出的政府 现在被收买
Governments that used to be voted in, are bought.

531
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,670
而可以用来曝光这些的
And a supposedly "free press"

532
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,730
所谓自由媒体
who could expose all this

533
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:37,170
现在都被这些企业集团所拥有
are now owned by these very corporations.

534
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:41,280
我们孩子们的自由生活岌岌可危
Our children's lives are at stake.

535
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,210
未来即将到来
The future is coming.

536
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:45,580
而他们只被要求做一件事
It wants only one thing from them:

537
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:46,780
就是绝对服从
Obedience.

538
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,850
看起来不太好啊
That doesn't look good.

539
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,120
是不妙
It's not.

540
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:53,020
卢卡斯在里面加入了2077年才有的一些成分
Lucas added some 2077 into the equation.
炸药

541
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,720
艾力克 你的出现刚刚好
Alec, your timing couldn't be better.

542
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,790
能用赛德科技的服务器搜索一下简单爆炸装置
Can you have the Sadtech servers run an IED bomb search,

543
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,290
起爆电路...
firing schematics...

544
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:04,130
我现在在派朗的办公室里
I'm in my office at Piron.

545
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:05,170
哦 当然
Of course.

546
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,330
当然是了
Of course you are.

547
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:09,940
你以为我是另一个我 是吗?
You thought I was other me, didn't you?

548
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,610
你早就知道了
You knew.

549
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,130
我还希望你不知道
I was hoping you didn't,

550
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:15,940
不过你这样我一点都不惊讶
but I wish I was surprised.

551
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,610
艾力克 我需要保护你
Alec, I needed to protect you,

552
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:20,150
我以为这是最好的
and I thought this was the best...

553
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,750
每个人都在努力的保护我
Everyone's trying to protect me,

554
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,880
但是你是借保护我的名义
but you scratch that protection

555
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,580
暗中谋取自己的利益
and it's self-interest underneath.

556
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,020
艾力克 我相信你
Alec, I trust you.

557
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,190
我了解你
I know you.

558
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,060
另一个你背叛了我
The other one betrayed me.

559
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:30,820
怎么会?
How?

560
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,630
我想补偿你 我一定做到
I want to make it up to you, and I will.

561
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,590
但是现在 人命关天
But right now, people's lives are at stake.

562
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,800
我以为我们是朋友
I thought we were friends,

563
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,760
但是我想我们之间只是交易
but I guess we were just business.

564
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,170
但是也没关系 我现在对交易很在行
But that's ok, I'm learning a lot in business.

565
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,870
不
No.

566
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,500
不是的 艾力克我们之间从来不是交易
No, Alec, it was never business.

567
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,710
从来都不是
Never.

568
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,970
嗯 那现在是了
Well, it is now.

569
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:48,600
你知道 一旦你的搭档背叛了你
You know, once a partner betrays you

570
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,510
你只有两个选择
there's only two choices:

571
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:52,380
要不买断他们 要不断绝关系
Buy them out, or shut them down.

572
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:55,010
对不起
I'm sorry.

573
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:56,720
绿线
Green wire.

574
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,180
什么?
What?

575
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,890
再见 琪拉
Goodbye, Kiera.

576
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,420
不要 艾力克?
No, Alec?

577
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:02,450
艾力克?
Alec?

578
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:16,550
哇 别碰它
Woah, leave it alone.

579
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,590
这是什么?
What is it?

580
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:21,820
是我帮琪拉做的东西
It's just something I'm working on for Kiera.

581
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,290
我也想喝两杯
I could use one of those.

582
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,730
我以为你不喜欢喝威士忌
I thought whiskey wasn't your thing.

583
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,170
是的 自我提升中
Yeah, I'm evolving.

584
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:40,240
我感觉现在的场景似曾相识
I'm experiencing some profound dajavu .

585
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,310
不是吧?
Seriously?!

586
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,450
这瓶威士忌比你年纪都大呢
That scotch is older than you are.

587
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,710
怎么个似曾相识法?
Dajavu  how?

588
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,680
得了吧 孩子
Come on, kid.

589
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,020
坐在你面前的可是我啊
It's me.

590
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:52,850
我眼睛很好
My vision is better than 20/20.

591
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:57,260
即使在我看到两个你 也能看得清清楚楚
Even when I am seeing double.

592
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,830
你有什么计划吗?
Did you even have a plan?

593
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,590
从时间上来说
Chronologically speaking.

594
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,860
孩子 你可是个时间旅行者
You're a time-traveller, kid.

595
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,330
你的成就可以堪比攀登珠穆朗玛峰
You scaled Everest.

596
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,570
探索马里亚纳海沟
Explored the Marianas Trench.

597
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,240
这可是人类的一大步
One giant step for mankind.

598
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:14,710
一个勇敢的新世界 你做了这一切为什么?
A brave new world, and you did it all for what?

599
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,110
泡妞?
Pussy?

600
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,710
我从没期望你是个有同情心有内涵的人
I never expected you to have any empathy or decency.

601
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,150
那条时间线上不是 这条也不可能
Not on that timeline or on this one.

602
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,250
嗯 这也好 这样你就永远不会失望
Well, that's good because you'll never be disappointed.

603
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,780
不像我
Unlike me.

604
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,750
你记得我们曾经做过的苍穹项目吗?
You remember when we used to have arc?

605
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,520
密切的合作?
A functioning partnership?

606
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,790
美好的未来
A future?

607
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,360
你为了重头来过就毁了我的生活
This little do-over of yours ruined my life.

608
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,800
是的 也不是完全没有用
Yeah, well it hasn't been in vain.

609
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:41,470
没有人的生活会被毁掉
Nobody's life needs to be ruined.

610
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,500
就看你怎么做了
That just depends on what you're capable of.

611
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,280
孩子 谢谢你看得起我
Kid, I'm flattered.

612
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,520
但是你要对付的不止我一个
But I'm not the only one you're dancing with.

613
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:03,320
你还没看见艾米丽的本事呢
And you haven't even begun to see Emily's do-si-do.

614
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,520
他把代码给我们了
He gave us the codes.

615
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,830
这个代码会给她们卫星的部分控制权
The codes might allow for some control of the satellite,

616
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,790
但是不会向外或向地面传输信号
but not outbound communication or the downlink.

617
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:13,360
没有人会看到特拉维斯的广播
Nobody is gonna see Travis's broadcast.

618
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,760
如果他有所察觉
If he figures that out...

619
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,230
他会觉得我们在耍他
He'll think we played him.

620
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:20,940
你的代码完全没用
Your codes were bullshit,

621
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,970
但一旦出事 搭上的人名可是货真价实的
but the corpses of those innocent people will be real.

622
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,570
而这些都会算到你和你公司的头上
And that's on you and your company.

623
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:26,680
我们有自己的警力
We have private forces.

624
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:27,740
雇佣军
Mercenaries.

625
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,610
请让我们协助你们
Allow us to assist you.

626
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:31,720
绝不可能
That's never gonna happen.

627
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,990
有进展吗?
Any luck?

628
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,690
希望如此
I hope so.

629
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,500
好了 搞定了
Ok, it's neutralized.

630
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:52,630
应急反应部队待命
Standby for ERT.

631
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:53,940
让他们进去
Send them in.

632
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:56,410
一分钟之后我们需要转移下他们的注意力
We need a diversion in one minute.

633
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:01,810
传输错误 代码不完整

634
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,750
代码不完整
The codes are incomplete.

635
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,680
没有代码就没有第二阶段
There's no phase 2 without them.

636
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:15,390
你外面的朋友似乎觉得我在开玩笑
Your friends outside don't seem to think I'm serious.

637
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,790
我们来让他们清醒一下吧
Let's wake them up.

638
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:21,030
让他们都站起来 脸对着墙
Stand them all up, make them face the wall.

639
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,830
快点
Move it!

640
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,270
不要这样做
Don't do this.

641
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,930
已经做了
It's already done.

642
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:28,570
不许讲话
No talking.

643
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,780
给我卫星的全部代码
Full access to that satellite right now,

644
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:41,420
否则就准备开始收尸吧
or I start dropping bodies.

645
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,180
狄龙是第一个
Dillon's first.

646
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,490
机会就这一个
Now, or never.

647
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:56,730
让他们攻进去
Send them in!

648
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,630
一组 行动
Team one, go!

649
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,680
找到他们
Find them.

650
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:14,310
杀了他们
Kill them.

651
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:21,220
我在美国航空航天局的朋友帮我拿到了代码
My NASA source helped me hack the codes.

652
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,660
这样就可以完全掌控卫星数据的传输
It should allow for full data routing to the satellite.

653
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:24,520
贝蒂?
Betty?

654
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,790
我知道你可以联系到卢卡斯
I know you can get a hold of Lucas.

655
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:26,660
卡洛斯
Carlos...

656
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:28,290
把代码发给他 现在
Send him those codes, now.

657
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:30,800
否则他们就死定了
Or they all start dying.

658
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:48,010
目标被击毙
Tango down.

659
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,280
自己人
Friendlies.

660
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,390
两个自己人
You've got two friendlies here!

661
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:01,490
等等 我们的朋友发过来完整的代码
Wait! Our friends sent the full codes,

662
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:03,060
我可以进入部分系统了
I can get some system access now.

663
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,560
这不会是他们的又一个花招吧?
Is this another trick?

664
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,430
不是
No.

665
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,500
协议正确
Protocols are good,

666
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:11,540
卫星间的数据正在传输
up-linking between satellites.

667
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:14,510
加尔萨 可以了
Garza. You're clear.

668
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,110
我们走
Let's go.

669
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,570
我们有九十秒的时间 走!
We've got 90 seconds. Go!

670
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,170
二组 报告情况?
Team two sit-rep?

671
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:52,280
正在接近演播室
Closing on studio.

672
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:55,880
所有人都在不间断的被监视
Every one of us is under constant surveillance.

673
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:58,610
这意味着当政府或者像弗门塔斯这样的大公司
What that surveillance means is that our every utterance

674
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:01,780
认为我们给他们制造了麻烦时,这些监控视频
becomes part of a court case that can be used against us

675
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:04,550
将会被法庭采用
when the government, or a company like Fermitas,

676
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:08,090
作为控告我们的证据
decides we're too much trouble.

677
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,720
走!
Move!

678
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,430
直接进去
Straight through!!!

679
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,690
我们找到他们了
We got them.

680
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:47,530
这有四个
Four here.

681
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,160
把硬盘给我
Give me the drive!

682
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:59,340
加尔萨那有消息了吗?
Any word from Garza?

683
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:02,640
看来你是对的
It turns out you were right.

684
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,810
弗门塔斯一直在监视大多数的企业集团
Fermitas has been spying on most of the big corporations.

685
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:08,380
她已经拿到了存有大量间谍信息的硬盘
She's pulled a drive with a treasure trove of espionage

686
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,320
这样扳倒企业集团议会
that should make bringing down the corporate congress

687
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:11,280
就简单多了
much easier.

688
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,520
包括派朗?
Including Piron?

689
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,820
艾力克·赛德勒不会知道是怎么回事的
Alec Sadler won't know what hit him.

690
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:14,990
我就想听这个
That's what I like to hear.

691
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,690
你也会很高兴知道你的理念
You'll also be happy to know that your message

692
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,190
也通过电波传递出去了
made it onto the airwaves.

693
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:21,430
让我们祈祷有人在听吧
Let's hope someone's listening.

694
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,100
他看起来不太开心啊
He does not look happy.

695
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:29,170
哦 当然不了
Oh, he is not.

696
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,300
贝蒂依靠美国航空航天局的一个朋友知道
Betty leaned on someone at NASA.

697
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,740
解放组织解锁一颗卫星之后 又继续解锁其他卫星
Liber8 unlocked one satellite to get to another.

698
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:35,170
为了什么?
To what end?

699
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:38,540
嗯 弗门塔斯有一个服务器农场被称为黑欧宝
Well, Fermitas has an isolated server farm called Black Opal.

700
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,410
没有硬件线路的接入或接出
There's no hard lines in or out,

701
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:43,120
外部世界也无法接触到除非
there's no links to the outside world except...

702
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:45,380
除非用卫星
Via satellite.

703
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,750
真的是与世隔绝
So it's silo'd off from the world.

704
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,890
又一个保险箱
Another safety deposit box.

705
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,190
你应该早点告诉我们黑欧宝的事
You should have come clean about black opal.

706
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:56,700
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

707
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:58,030
解放组织很聪明
Liber8 is clever.

708
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,930
如果不知道他们的目的我们是无法战胜他们的
You cannot fight them unless you know their end game.

709
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:03,570
他们拿到了什么?
What did they get?

710
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,240
警官们 你们今晚表现的很好
You did a great job here tonight, officers.

711
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,040
也许我们就把中间这些都跳过去
Maybe we should just skip to the end

712
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,180
也许他们可以开始叫我们保卫者了
maybe they can start calling us protectors.

713
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:27,670
你知道要不是贝蒂
You know we wouldn't have saved those hostages

714
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,570
我们救不了那些人质
if it hadn't have been for Betty.

715
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,070
她起了重要的作用
She made all the difference.

716
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:34,170
她让解放组织在这次交锋中占了上风
She made us play into Liber8's hands.

717
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,380
在她帮我们抓到那群混蛋之前
Until she helps us nail those bastards,

718
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:38,540
我是不会饶过她的
I can't look past that.

719
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,280
在电视上一通歇斯底里的咆哮
The terrorists won a small victory by getting

720
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,210
让他们取得了短暂的胜利
their delusional rant to air,

721
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:44,950
但是他们没有打倒任何人
but they did not defeat anyone.

722
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:46,490
有一个人应当得到我们所有人的尊敬
One man deserves credit

723
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,120
危急关头表现出最英勇的一面
for embodying the best that we can be.

724
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,220
那就是我们的警察局长杰克·狄龙
Inspector Jack Dillon.

725
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,960
他救了我 还有我的同事
He saved my life, and those of my colleagues.

726
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:59,000
为此 我将永远心存感激
And for that, I will be eternally grateful.

727
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,830
谢谢你 杰克
Thank you, Jack.

728
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:03,740
你的勇气鼓舞着我们
Your courage inspires us all.

729
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:12,280
看来有人爱上他了
I think someone has a bit of a crush.

730
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:16,580
是啊 他现在真的应该听点好消息
Yeah, he could use a little silver lining.

731
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,320
他已经听到了
He got that already.

732
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:23,890
昨天晚上有两个英雄 狄龙和你
There were two heroes last night, Dillon and you.

733
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,290
卡洛斯·福乃格 你是个优秀的指挥官
You are a leader of men, Carlos Fonnegra.

734
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:30,930
是啊 指挥别人
Yeah, men.

735
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,600
我是遵从你的命令引开他们的注意力的
I followed your orders to create that diversion.

736
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:39,200
也许你也不是那么差劲
Maybe there's a little hope for you after all.

737
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:44,640
妈妈会给我交保释的
Mom's gonna pay my bail.

738
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,580
我本来可以走的
I shouldn't even be here.

739
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,280
能让我和我女儿单独谈谈吗
Let me have a moment with my daughter.

740
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,820
让查普曼把录音器材关了
Tell Chapman to cut the recording.

741
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,130
好了 我们现在安全了
Ok, we're secure.

742
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,200
你胳膊怎么样?
How's your arm?

743
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:10,830
没事
It's nothing.

744
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:13,000
老爸 你还真是条汉子啊
You're so hardcore, dad.

745
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:25,020
你确定要这么做吗?
Are you sure about this?

746
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:26,950
后悔也来不及了
It's too late now.

747
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:30,090
不 还来得及
No, it's not.

748
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,420
老爸 木已成舟了
Dad, the course is set.

749
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,630
下一步怎么办?
So how's this gonna work?

750
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:41,630
我会动用我的关系对你轻判
I've used my influence to push for a lighter sentence.

751
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:44,470
三个月就行
Three months should do it.

752
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,000
你确定他们会来找我?
You sure they'll come for me?

753
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,490
负责追捕他们的家伙
Sympathetic daughter of the guy

754
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:48,940
却有一个富有同情心的女儿
in charge of catching them?

755
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:53,540
你就好像棒棒糖
You're like candy on a stick.

756
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:58,350
宝贝 你要让解放组织相信你支持他们的事业
Sweetheart, you make Liber8 believe you support their cause,

757
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,980
打入他们内部
you get inside,

758
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:04,320
你进去之后 我们将他们一网打尽
and once you're there we'll bring them down together.

759
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:07,160
他在电视上说的 有些我确实同意
What he said on that broadcast, I do agree with some of it.

760
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:09,160
那就好
That's good.

761
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:12,960
这样会保护你
It'll protect you if you believe it.

762
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,940
但是不要给弄出个派翠西亚·赫斯特 好吗?
Just don't go all Patty hearst on me, ok?
派翠西亚·赫斯特 美国报业大王威廉·赫斯特的孙女

763
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,230
但是不要给弄出个派翠西亚·赫斯特 好吗?
Just don't go all Patty hearst on me, ok?
1974年被绑架后加入激进组织并参与抢劫一家银行被FBI通缉

764
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,730
谁?
Who?

765
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:21,600
我知道她是谁 我不会的
I know who she is, I won't.

766
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,510
老爸 我相信你
I believe in you, dad.

767
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:29,040
好的
Ok.

768
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,680
我现在要走出去
I'm gonna walk out of here now.

769
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:33,380
你该大骂我一顿了
You should really let me have it.

770
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,020
你个混蛋
You son of a bitch!

771
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:41,120
我恨你 你听见了吗?
I hate you, you hear me?

772
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,690
我恨你!
I hate you!

773
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:45,030
你怎么能这样对我?!
How can you do this to me?!

774
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,790
你是怎么当父亲的?!!
What kind of a father are you?!!

775
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:50,130
这牺牲也太大了
That's a hell of a sacrifice.

776
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,930
做对的事是要付出代价的
Doing the right thing doesn't come cheap.

777
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:02,080
长官?
Sir?

778
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:07,250
她现在也许真的恨你 但是她还是你女儿
She may mean that now, but she is your child.

779
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,480
最终她会回到你的身边
In time you will get her back.

780
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:14,090
你又知道什么?
What do you know about it?

781
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:23,930
他们很快会来抓我的
They'll be coming for me soon.

782
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,830
但是我还是会再见到你的 对吗?
But I'm gonna see you again, right?

783
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,810
宝贝我爱你
I love you, baby.

784
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:38,010
人生有时你必须做出牺牲
Sometimes in life you've gotta make sacrifices.

785
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,150
但是你知道还有好的一面吗?
But you know the good thing?

786
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:45,750
就是我们可以一起做
We're doing this together.

787
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:49,720
这是能让你和你妈妈真正安全的方法

最终还是选择忠诚
Loyal after all.

789
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:16,150
你知道我们如何称呼那些帮助我们
Do you know what we call citizens

790
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:19,180
抓住恐怖分子的公民吗?
who help us apprehend terrorists?

791
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,480
不知道?
No?

792
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,350
爱国者
Patriots.

793

这个胸针会让所有人知道
This pin will let everyone know

你有多么的特别多么的忠诚

这标志着荣誉

796

你应该感到无比的骄傲

797
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:00,960
没关系的 宝贝
It's ok, baby.

798
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:02,990
