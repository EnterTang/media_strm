1
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,210
别试了。你知道这不可能。
Quit trying. You know it's impossible.

2
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,510
我们唯一可能是毫无可能。
Only chance we've got is no chance at all.

3
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,830
我知道这不可能做到。
I know it can't be done.

4
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,480
我真的很高兴你不知道!
I'm just glad that you didn't know it!

5
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,920
我希望你意识到你袖手旁观。
I hope you realize you did nothing to help the situation.

6
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,820
来，对付这个。
Here, work on these.

7
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,190
我会像老鼠一样安静。
I'll be quiet as a mouse.

8
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,590
这需要团队合作，蒂莎。
It takes teamwork, Tisa.

9
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,560
好吗?
OK?

10
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,380
准备,开始!
Ready, go!

11
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:31,970
我有个主意，如果我们能倒转极性
I've got an idea, that if we can reverse the polarity

12
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:39,580
解开手铐，我们离自由的一步之遥
on these cuffs, the only thing standing between us and freedom

13
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,170
是偷一艘飞船。
is stealing a starship.

14
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,040
哦,当然。
Oh, sure.

15
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,780
这就是全部吗?
Is that all?

16
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,890
想想看，我还发愁出去呢。
And to think I was worried there for a second.

17
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:49,080
如果我们能用链子把牢锁短路的话
If we could short circuit the lock on the cell with a chain--

18
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,520
是的，但是我们戴着链子。
Yeah, but we're wearing the chains.

19
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,190
小小的电击不会伤害任何人。
A little shock never hurt anyone.

20
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,130
给我助推一下。
Give me a boost step.

21
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,090
准备?
Ready?

22
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,220
1、2、3 !
1, 2, 3!

23
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,520
再高几英寸。
Just a few more inches.

24
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,980
我就要够到了。
I almost got it.

25
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,920
再高一点。
Go over a little bit.

26
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,900
碰到了!
Got it!

27
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,340
你没事吧?
TISA: Are you all right?

28
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,290
也许有点烤熟了。
A little well done, perhaps.

29
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,250
嘿，我们出去!
Hey, we're out of here!

30
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,570
你迟到了。
You're late.

31
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,810
有什么稀奇的?
What else is new?

32
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,690
你看到那两个隔离监禁的吗?
Did you see those two they threw in solitary today?

33
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,980
还没有。
Not yet.

34
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,540
我愿意用一年的工资换里面爽10分钟。
I'd give a year's pay for 10 minutes in there.

35
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,380
哦!
Oh!

36
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,830
哦!
Uh!

37
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,230
噢。呃。
Ow. Uh.

38
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,990
重抓黄瓜的感觉真好。
Feels good to be back in the saddle again.

39
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,220
我可以说些粗话，但我不会说。
I could say something rude, but I won't.

40
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,380
这艘船的航程是多少?
What kind of range does this ship got?

41
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,990
乞丐没法选择。
Beggars can't be choosers.

42
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,490
有，我们可能要选择被遗忘的航线。
Yeah, we could be choosing a course to oblivion.

43
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,290
至少这是我们的选择。
At least it's our choice.

44
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,610
如果你无所谓去哪的话
Well, if it's all the same to you,

45
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:34,480
我宁愿不要俗话道半路没电了。
I'd rather not run out of power between worlds, as they say.

46
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,440
看看这个。
Well, look at this.

47
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,370
导航系统――这不是一艘破烂船
Netaglide-- this isn't a shabby-ass derelict

48
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,580
我们在开。
we're driving.

49
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,130
我们用原子感应来烧烤。
We're cooking with atomic induction.

50
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,740
好了，大厨，我们快飞吧，在太烫手之前。
OK, chef, let's take off before things get too hot.

51
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,030
别急着脱内裤，妹妹。
Keep your pants on, sister.

52
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,000
我得先破解弹射密码，
I've got to unscramble the launch code first,

53
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,900
还有打开逃生口。
and open the escape hatch.

54
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,060
我乐意把这艘母舰的墙顶个洞
I'd love to punch a hole through the wall of this mothership

55
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,290
只要我是公的，但我不确定我们有没有
if I could, but I'm not sure if we've

56
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:05,830
足够的能量起跑。
got enough of a running start.

57
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,110
我们需要戴特殊的手套来使用这台电脑。
We need a special glove to access this computer.

58
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,220
-试试手套箱。-你真可爱。
- Try the glove compartment. - Oh, you're cute.

59
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,670
再给神奇手指一秒钟，
Just give these magic fingers another second,

60
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,040
我要给这只笨狗下指令。
and I'll have this puppy programmed.

61
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,660
- 你真聪明。- 明得耀眼。
- You're brilliant. - Dazzling.

62
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,190
人们必须戴太阳镜。
People have to wear sunglasses.

63
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,090
好了。应该可以了。
There. That should do the trick.

64
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,150
点火装置在哪里?
Well, where's the ignition?

65
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,660
哦，别又开始了。
Oh, don't start that again.

66
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,460
接下来你会想让我跳下去
Next thing you're going to want me to get out and jump

67
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,160
启动它。
start it.

68
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,430
- 到底是什么声音? - 猜。
- What the hell is that? - Guess.

69
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,860
要是我们让两个奴隶跑了，我们会被降级。
We let a couple slaves escape, we're going to be busted.

71
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,720
引擎已热。
Engine's hot.

72
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,020
防御驱力已开。
Defense drive engaged.

73
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,150
我们上路。
We're on our way.

74
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,000
我们走。
Let's go.

75
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,070
检查扫描装置。
Check the scanners.

76
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,410
让我们看看我们到底有多自由。
Let's find out just how free we are.

77
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,270
附近有东西吗?
Anything nearby?

78
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,150
外面有点黑。
It's kind of dark out there.

79
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,410
到底有东西吗?
Anything at all?

80
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:14,740
在我看来，我们在漫游鬼城。
Looks to me like we're cruising the town of nowhere.

81
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,020
- 这只是一艘救生艇。- 是的。
- This is only a lifeboat. - Yeah.

82
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,180
我们的装备真没法星系跳跃。
We're not exactly equipped to go galaxy hopping.

83
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,790
我们选择的弃船时机真好。
We picked a fine time to jump ship.

84
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,440
我捡拾到信号，离这里不远
I'm picking up something, not far from here--

85
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,140
信标。
beacon.

86
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,060
这里有?
Out here?

87
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:33,760
我们来看看。
Let's check it out.

88
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,780
它来自那个小行星。
TISA: It's coming from that small planetoid.

89
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,260
你知道吗，这有点蹊跷。
You know, there's something odd about this.

90
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,140
这个信号不仅仅是安全航道信标。
That signal isn't just a safe channel beacon.

91
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:44,050
光束正在传送天文导航着陆
That beam's transmitting astro-navigational landing

92
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:44,830
坐标。
coordinates.

93
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,710
我们在这里找到一块大得可以降落的岩石就算幸运
We'd be lucky to find a rock out here big enough to set down

94
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,490
你还质疑宜居世界的邀请
on, and you're questioning an invitation to a habitable world

95
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:51,910
质疑着陆跑道?
with a landing strip?

96
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,010
我就把定向网格光束
I'll lock the beam of the directional grid

97
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,280
锁定入快速引导系统。
into the hyperdrive system.

98
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,750
不对劲!
Something's wrong!

99
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,760
我们的轨道下降速度是不是有点快?
TISA: Aren't we dipping the orbit a bit fast?

100
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,760
踩下刹车!
Hit the brakes!

101
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,240
切断牵引光束。
Cut the tractor beam.

102
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,230
反推器不点火。
Retros aren't firing.

103
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,170
我们没有减速!
We're not slowing down!

104
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,060
驾船脱离。
Disengage [INAUDIBLE].

105
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,290
它被锁定在某种自动驾驶上!
It's locked in some kind of autopilot!

106
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,240
什么也不工作了。
Nothing's functioning.

107
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,390
光束正在盖过我们的控制。
The beam is overriding our controls.

108
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,700
引擎不反转。
Engines won't reverse.

109
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,700
我无法拉起来!
I can't pull it out!

110
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,190
我们在下坠!
We're going down!

111
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:27,990
我们别无选择。
We've got no choice.

112
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,150
我们必须跳伞。
We're going to have to jump for it.

113
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,150
机会渺茫。
Slim chance.

114
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,400
比没有机会强。
Better than none.

115
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,230
我们就乘坐火箭尽可能接近地面
We'll ride this rocket as close as we can, then

116
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,370
然后跳伞，希望有好结果。
bail out and hope for the best.

117
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,470
说得对，不是吗?
TISA: This is it, isn't it?

118
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,170
也许成功了呢。
You never know.

119
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,660
下面有大气层。
There is an atmosphere down there.

120
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,130
对，但我们能呼吸吗?
Yeah, but can we breathe it?

121
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,970
我们很快就会知道了。
We'll soon find out.

122
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,850
这真不是我所希望的结果。
This wasn't exactly the way I hoped things would turn out.

123
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,650
有人在这里吗?
Is anybody here?

124
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,140
有人在家吗?
is there anybody home?

125
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,720
我不是想闯入。
I'm not trying to break in.

126
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,100
我的飞船在岛的远端坠入大海。
My ship crashed into the sea on the far side of the island.

127
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,380
恐怕我是唯一的幸存者。
I'm afraid I'm the only survivor.

128
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,020
你能听懂我的语言吗?
Can you understand my language?

129
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,690
你编程了说话吗?
Are you programmed to speak?

130
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:36,140
他从来不跟别人说话，除非我指示他。
ZED: He never talks to others, unless I instruct him to.

131
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,020
然而，他听得懂每一个字。
However, he understood every word.

132
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,890
晚上好。
Good evening.

133
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,330
这是你的房子吗?
Is this your house?

134
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,160
是的,它是。
Yes, it is.

135
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,930
我叫泽德。
My name is Zed.

136
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,160
很高兴见到你――
I'm glad to meet you--

137
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,360
非常高兴。
very glad.

138
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,780
我刚刚告诉他我飞船失事。
I was just telling him I was in a shipwreck.

139
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,900
我知道。
I know.

140
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,860
你知道?
You know?

141
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,670
怎么知道的?
How?

142
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:01,390
达莉亚！
TISA: Daria!

143
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,200
我以为我失去你了!
I thought I'd lost you!

144
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,530
没这样走运。
No such luck.

145
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,150
我猜我们仍然无法摆脱彼此。
I guess we're still stuck with each other.

146
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,980
我好怕你没成功。
I was afraid you didn't make it.

147
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,720
我深有感触。
I know the feeling.

148
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,760
你觉得我的新衣服怎么样?
How do you like my new outfit?

149
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,750
我们的东道主似乎什么都准备好了。
Our host seems to be ready for anything.

150
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,290
他对我当时的穿着不予置评。
He didn't say a word about the way I was dressed.

151
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,200
他一定觉得我有点衣衫褴褛
It must have occurred to him I was a shade

152
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,490
对于拥有一艘星际飞船。
shabby to own a starship.

153
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:24,990
嗯，我自己也不算时尚巅峰。
Well, I'm not exactly the height of fashion myself.

154
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,480
你提了不对劲的着陆坐标吗?
Have you mentioned the off-beam landing coordinates?

155
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,160
时机还没到。
The opportunity hasn't exactly presented itself.

156
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,100
我不想问太多问题，
I didn't want to start asking too many questions,

157
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,230
因为我不想回答任何问题。
because I didn't want to start answering any.

158
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,510
瓦克会带你去客房。
Vak will show you to a guestroom.

159
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,020
你必须马上脱掉那些衣服。
You must get out of those clothes at once.

160
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,820
于我心有戚戚焉。
They look just about the way I feel.

161
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,410
瓦克会给你找别的衣服。
Vak will find you others.

162
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:47,200
我们为这种紧急情况做了准备。
We're prepared for such emergencies.

163
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,370
晚餐马上就上。
Dinner will be served shortly.

164
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,950
你来的时候，我和我的客人们正要吃饭。
My guests and I were about to dine when you arrived.

165
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,330
我们会等你的。
We'll wait for you.

166
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,510
客人们?
Guests?

167
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,530
是的。
Yes.

168
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:59,730
还有另一艘失事船只的幸存者
There are survivors of another wreck

169
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,290
呆在这房子里。
staying here in the house.

170
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,150
另一艘失事船只?
Another wreck?

171
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,280
不幸的是，这个区域的太空航线
Unfortunately, the space lanes in this sector

172
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,560
是极其危险的。
are extremely dangerous.

173
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,840
这个我们以后再谈。
But we can talk about that later.

174
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,050
不要等我。
Don't wait for me.

175
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,840
我得花点时间梳洗打扮。
It'll take me a while to get myself cleaned up.

176
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,560
总之，失事让我还是有点惊魂未定。
And anyway, I'm still a little shook up from the crash.

177
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,180
我理解。
I understand.

178
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,510
也许你以后会加入我们。瓦克。
Perhaps you will join us later. Vak.

179
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,830
- 怎么了? - 没。
- Is anything wrong? - No.

180
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:31,730
没，没什么。
No, nothing.

181
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,590
给你衣服。
Here are your clothes.

182
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:38,420
告诉我，为什么窗户上有栅栏?
Tell me, why are there bars on these windows?

183
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,880
这曾经是一座古老的堡垒。
This was once an old fortress.

184
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,560
它由太空海盗建造，最后
It was built by space pirates, and eventually

185
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,500
在很久之前遗弃。
abandoned long ago.

186
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,960
现在栅栏把丛林的危险挡在外面。
Now the bars keep the dangers of the jungle out.

187
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,940
你搜过海岸了吗?
Have you searched the shore?

188
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,130
还有其他人吗?
Were there any others?

189
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,920
进来。
[KNOCKING] - Come in.

190
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,680
你美貌夺目。
You look breathtaking.

191
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,610
衣服非常适合你。
Fits you like a glove.

192
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,310
你从哪儿得来的衣服?
Where did you get it?

193
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,280
城堡以前房客们众多遗留物之一。
One of the many leftovers from the castle's previous tenants.

194
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,950
海盗掠夺品?
Pirate plunder?

195
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:26,840
瓦克一定告诉你此地历史一二了?
Vak must have been telling you some of our local history?

196
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,970
没我想知道的多。
Not as much as I'd like to know.

197
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,560
我们吃完晚餐了。
We finished dinner.

198
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,740
你的朋友蒂莎一直在询问你。
Your friend, Tisa, has been asking about you.

199
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,970
我现在精神好多了，谢谢。
I'm a bit more refreshed now, thanks.

200
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,710
我几乎恢复了正常。
I feel almost myself again.

201
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:41,610
那我们下去和其他人会合吧。
Then let's go down and join the others.

202
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,300
你需要的是一些刺激，
What you need is some stimulation,

203
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,690
一些有趣的同伴。
some interesting company.

204
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:46,590
两者我可以向你保证。
I can promise you both.

205
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:09,430
达莉亚，这是希拉，还有她的弟弟瑞克。
Daria, this is Shela, and her brother, Rik.

206
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,230
我耳闻了关于你的很多话。
I've heard a lot about you.

207
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,390
我希望没什么好话。
Nothing good, I hope.

208
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,460
蒂莎没有说其它的话。
SHELA: Tisa hasn't spoken of anything else.

209
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,710
你肯定是淑女报仇十年不晚。
It sure took you long enough to make it down.

210
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,350
你值得等待。
You're worth waiting for.

211
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,620
很荣幸两位美女
This is a pleasure-- two beautiful women

212
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,380
同一天到达。
arriving the same day.

213
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,340
直到美女你们出现，我才开始
Until you girls turned up, I was beginning to get

214
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,810
眼前一亮――
just a shade stir crazy--

215
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:30,790
10天只有丛林和海洋。
10 days of nothing but jungle and ocean.

216
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,860
瑞克对我的小岛一点也不感兴趣。
Rik is less than thrilled by my little island.

217
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,360
那为什么逗留?
Well, then why stay?

218
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,630
这不是我的主意。
It's not my idea.

219
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:40,080
只有一艘小艇，而且正在修理中。
There's only one launch, and that's being worked on.

220
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,150
我想你们得耐心稍等
Guess you'll have to be patient for a little while

221
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,170
更久。
longer.

222
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,660
如果我是你，我不会抱怨。
Well, I wouldn't complain if I were you.

223
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,270
我觉得我现在活在借来的光阴里。
I feel like I'm living on borrowed time right now.

224
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,250
我真的很高兴来到这里。
I'm just glad to be here.

225
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,840
宾至如归的舒适体验
All the comforts of home in the most

226
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,780
在银河系最遥远的角落。
remote corner of the galaxy.

227
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,530
太遥远了。
Too remote.

228
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,600
当然，这对你来说很完美，泽德。
Of course, it's perfect for you, Zed.

229
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,060
你可以随心所欲打猎。
You can go hunting if you want.

230
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,130
打猎?
Hunting?

231
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,070
在这里?
Here?

232
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,980
他白天睡觉，晚上打猎。
He sleeps all day and hunts all night.

233
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,620
我打赌他对你做同样的事。
Bet he has you doing the same thing.

234
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,730
你称这种对狩猎的痴迷为娱乐，
This obsession with hunting you call sport,

235
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,240
是不是有点矛盾?
isn't it just a little inconsistent?

236
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,190
为生存杀戮的丛林野兽
A beast in the jungle killing merely for his existence

237
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,560
被称为野蛮。
is called savage.

238
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,900
为娱乐杀戮的人被称为文明。
The man killing just for sport is called civilized.

239
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,060
这不是有点矛盾吗?
Isn't that a bit contradictory?

240
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,680
你凭什么认为它不是娱乐
What makes you think it isn't just

241
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,440
对动物来说和人一样是娱乐?
as much sport for the animal as it is for the man?

242
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,040
以这个家伙为例。
Take that fellow right there, for instance.

243
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,480
他从来没有逃不掉的时候。
There was never a time when he couldn't have gotten away.

244
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,890
但是他不想。
But he didn't want to.

245
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,780
他对狩猎我产生兴趣。
He got interested in hunting me.

246
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,830
他不恨我跟踪他
He didn't hate me for stalking him

247
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:44,470
就像我不恨他试图攻击我一样。
any more than I hated him for trying to charge me.

248
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,940
事实上，我们惺惺相惜。
Matter of fact, we admired each other.

249
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,940
也许。
Perhaps.

250
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,910
但是你愿意和他交换位置吗?
But would you change places with him?

251
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:53,870
不是现在。
Not now.

252
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,560
不要回避这个问题。
Don't evade the issue.

253
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,170
这游戏会有同样多的娱乐吗
Would there be as much sport in the game

254
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:00,710
如果你是猎物，而不是猎人?
if you were the prey, instead of the hunter?

255
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,710
这是我永远不必做出决定的事情。
That is something I will never have to decide.

256
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:07,670
这个宇宙被分为两类人
This universe is divided into two types of people--

257
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:13,880
猎人和猎物。
the hunter and the hunted.

258
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,870
你想去打猎吗?
You want to go hunting?

259
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:16,860
我们走。
Let's go.

260
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,740
我们开一个盛大派对，喝得酩酊大醉，
We'll have a big party, get totally blitzed,

261
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,300
然后扫射激光
and spray laser bolts--

262
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,390
覆盖丛林。
--all over the jungle.

263
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,080
十足文明的观点。
Completely civilized point of view.

264
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,130
文明?
SHELA: Civilized?

265
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,220
是的。
Yes.

266
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:32,550
瑞克带刺的话语就像狩猎的前奏。
Rik talks of stimulants as a prelude to the hunt.

267
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,610
就像早餐前喝鸡尾酒?
Cocktails before breakfast?

268
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:38,580
我们野蛮人知道，只在追逐之后喝
We barbarians know that it is only after the chase

269
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,330
男人满足之后。
that man indulges.

270
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,870
你知道阿特里克酋长的说法吗?
You know the saying of the Alteric chieftains?

271
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:48,550
先猎敌人，再猎女人。
Hunt first the enemy, then the woman.

272
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:51,170
这是每个地方野蛮人的想法。
That's the savage's idea everywhere.

273
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,930
这是自然的本能。
It's the natural instinct.

274
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,550
热血奔涌来自杀戮
Blood rushes from the kill.

275
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:58,100
一个激情澎湃，然后另一个激情消灭，然后爱。
One passion builds, then another kill, then love.

276
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,750
当你懂了这一点，你就懂了极乐。
And when you know that, then you know ecstasy.

277
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,360
原谅我。
Forgive me.

278
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,860
当我开始谈论狩猎时，
When I start talking about hunting,

279
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,500
我变得视而不见一切，
I become oblivious to everything,

280
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,760
即使是漂亮的女人。
even beautiful women.

281
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,850
你愿意为我们演奏吗?
Will you play for us?

282
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,240
泽德在这方面很有造诣
Zed's quite accomplished on this rather

283
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,920
他独特的乐器。
unique instrument of his.

284
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,990
这是全息琴弦
It's a holographic [INAUDIBLE]..

285
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,100
它就是将触碰改造成光声模式，
It simply transforms touch into patterns of light and sound,

286
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,820
我在这方面还不是很有造诣。
and I'm really not all that accomplished at it.

287
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,120
他太棒了。
SHELA: He's fantastic.

288
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,840
你们应该看看他能演奏出什么。
You should see what he can make it do.

289
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,390
如果你们确定你们听得下去的话。
Well, if you're sure that you can stand it.

290
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,250
我想透透气。
I could use some air.

291
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,200
你能赏脸陪我去吗?
Would you be gracious enough to accompany me?

292
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,580
我们的东道主的确是个不寻常的人物。
Our host certainly is an unusual character.

293
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,750
恐怖这个词更好。
RIK: Frightening is a better word.

294
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,940
不要信任他。
Don't trust him.

295
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,150
你为什么这么说?
What makes you say that?

296
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:08,120
我不像看起来那么醉。
I'm not as loaded as I seem.

297
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,780
这地方有不祥的事情在发生。
There's something sinister going on in this place.

298
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,700
我们都是这里的囚犯。
We're all prisoners here.

299
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,350
他的飞船没有任何问题。
There's nothing wrong with his spacecraft.

300
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,930
他谎称需要修理。
He lied about it needing repairs.

301
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:20,390
机器人在与补给船
The android makes a rendezvous with the supply

302
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,480
定期会合。
ship at regular intervals.

303
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,140
嗯，也许他喜欢你们的陪伴。
Well, perhaps he enjoys your company.

304
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,600
一周前我们有四个人。
There were four of us a week ago.

305
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,940
其他人消失了。
The others have disappeared.

306
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,610
一天晚饭后，他把我们的飞行员带进战利品室。
One night after dinner, he took our pilot into the trophy room.

307
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:35,970
锁着的门?
The locked door?

308
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,170
是的。
Yes.

309
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,770
昨晚他带走了我们的领航员。
Last night he took our navigator.

310
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,510
从那以后我们就没看见他。
We haven't seen him since.

311
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,670
你问过他他们的情况吗?
Have you asked him about them?

312
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:44,710
他说他们去打猎了。
He says they've gone hunting.

313
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,160
有多少机器人?
How many androids are there?

314
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,760
两个。
Two.

315
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,820
那边的瓦克照看房子。
Vak over there looks after the house.

316
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,840
克雷尔负责巡逻海滩和丛林。
Krel patrols the beaches and the jungle.

317
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,880
我们每时每刻都被监视着，不分昼夜。
We're watched every moment, night and day.

318
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,720
小心。
Be careful.

319
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,960
他在看着我们。
He's looking at us.

320
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,630
你不想再演奏吗?
SHELA: Won't you play some more?

321
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,140
你们一定累了。
You must be tired.

322
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,650
毕竟，是午夜了。
After all, it is midnight.

323
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:20,140
你们都该上床睡觉了。
It's time for all of you to turn in.

324
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,580
瓦克。
Vak.

325
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,020
每天晚上他打发我们上床睡觉
Every night, he packs us off to bed,

326
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,800
像对待坏小孩一样。
like bad, little children.

327
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,590
哦，我的亲爱的
ZED: Aw, my dear--

328
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,900
迷人的孩子们。
charming children.

329
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,460
这是迷人的一晚。
It's been a fascinating evening.

330
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,980
谁想睡觉?
Who wants to go to bed?

331
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,930
你答应过带我去战利品室的。
You promised to show me the trophy room.

332
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,730
是的，我答应了，但不是现在――以后。
Yes, I did, but not now-- later.

333
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:39,650
晚安。
Good night.

334
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,220
能被你营救我很高兴。
It's been a pleasure being rescued by you.

335
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,770
晚安。
Good night.

336
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,430
我害怕发出声音。
I was afraid to make a noise.

337
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,200
为什么?
Why?

338
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,190
我姐姐不在她的房间。
My sister's not in her room.

339
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,360
这很糟吗?
Is that so bad?

340
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,090
在这个地方很糟。
It is in this place.

341
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,120
我很担心。
I'm worried.

342
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,710
我是说，泽德在计划着什么事，
I mean, Zed's planning something, something

343
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,750
谋害希拉和我。
involving Shela and me.

344
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,620
你今晚喝得太多了。
You got pretty loaded tonight.

345
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,710
也许你只是在头脑中夸大了这一切。
Maybe you're just exaggerating all this in your mind.

346
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,480
我只是假装喝高了。
I was only pretending to be high.

347
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,710
为什么?
Why?

348
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:41,010
因为如果我保持清醒，我可能就是泽德的下一个牺牲品。
Because if I stay sober, I'm likely to be Zed's next victim.

349
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:43,170
你觉得她去哪了?
Where do you think she's gone?

350
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,500
其他人去哪了?
Where do the others go?

351
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,620
楼下的那扇门。
That door downstairs.

352
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,780
你吓死我了。
You scared me half out of my wits.

353
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,280
你在这下面干什么?
What are you doing down here?

354
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,110
总得有人去弄清楚这是什么地方。
Somebody had to find out what's in this place.

355
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,260
泽德和他的机器人离开后，我搜查了他的房间
After Zed and his boys left, I searched his room

356
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,320
找到了这把复制的钥匙。
and found this duplicate key.

357
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,990
你看到墙上的东西了吗?
Did you see what's on those walls?

358
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,690
是的。
Yeah.

359
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,780
这就是他对我们所有人的计划。
That's what he's planning for all of us.

360
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,250
这条走廊通向哪里?
Where does that corridor lead to?

361
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,460
他在后面藏了一艘逃生艇。
He's got an escape launch stashed back there.

362
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,520
这是我们离开这里的门票。
That's our ticket out of here.

363
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,970
不能不带上希拉。
Not without Shela.

364
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:42,800
对，但她在哪?
Yeah, but where is she?

365
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,150
- 下面有什么? - 我不知道。
- And down there? - I don't know.

366
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,770
我还没机会看。
I haven't had a chance to look.

367
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:57,660
一定有办法出去。
There must be some way out of here.

368
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,440
我们会找到答案。
We'll find out.

369
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,190
希拉仍然不见踪影。
Shela's still gone.

370
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,930
他们带的那个袋子里装的是什么?
What was in that sack they were carrying?

371
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:00,260
我们不妨面对事实:我们在跟疯子打交道。
We may as well face the fact we're dealing with a maniac.

372
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,640
我们只有一次机会赢那样的男人。
We've only one chance with a man like that.

373
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,190
我们得先下手为强。
We've got to get the jump on him.

374
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,920
他的激光枪放在哪里?
Where does he keep his laser guns?

375
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,850
你听他说了他用弓箭打猎。
You heard what he said about hunting with bow and arrow.

376
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:19,500
如果他有激光步枪，他一定
If he has any laser rifles, he must keep

377
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,860
把步枪封存在某处。
them locked up here somewhere.

378
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,590
至少我们知道他的船在哪里。
At least we know where he keeps his ship.

379
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,700
是的，但是你不能从外面到达飞船发射台。
Yes, but you can't get to the launch pad from outside.

380
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,400
我试过了。
I've tried.

381
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,970
这里没有栅栏。
There are no bars here.

382
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,530
我想知道为什么。
I wonder why.

383
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,120
这之前是泽德的房间。
It was Zed's room.

384
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,690
他把它给了希拉。
He gave it to Shela.

385
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:41,100
他很慷慨，但我们很幸运。
Generous of him, but lucky for us.

386
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,930
- 我们得找到她。- 我们会的。
- We have to find her. - We will.

387
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:44,280
我要搜查城堡。
I'm going to search the castle.

388
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,190
你只会被抓住，让泽德发现我们在对付他。
You'll only get caught and tip Zed off we're onto him.

389
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,020
离天亮还有几个小时
We've still got several hours before dawn,

390
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,150
我们必须利用这些时间。
and we have to use them to advantage.

391
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,950
你有刀吗?
Have you got a knife?

392
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:54,320
只有这个。
Only this.

393
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,220
这就够了。
It'll have to do.

394
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,840
泽德在这里忙的时候，你和我
While Zed is occupied here, you and I

395
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,400
在丛林里设陷阱
will set traps in the jungle.

396
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,670
如果他今晚又出去打猎，争取给我们发信号
If he leaves to go hunting again tonight, signal us if you can,

397
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:05,600
并努力找到希拉。
and try to find Shela.

398
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,370
泽德认为他把我们困住了。
Zed thinks he has us cornered.

399
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:12,110
但他可能会发现自己被困的感觉。
But he may find out how it feels to be trapped himself.

400
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:14,670
解决了他，机器人可能不会
With him out of the way, the androids might not

401
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:16,410
太难对付。
be too hard to handle.

402
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:17,720
如果他们检查我们的房间呢?
What if they check our rooms?

403
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,250
我们必须冒这个险。
It's a chance we'll have to take.

404
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,810
祝我们好运吧。
Wish us luck.

405
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:22,640
我们需要运气。
We'll need it.

406
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,340
快点回来。
Hurry back.

407
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,230
如果你们俩在外面被杀了
If you two get yourselves killed out there,

408
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,640
你们有我报仇。
you'll have me to answer to.

409
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,400
把你的手拿开。
Take your hands off me.

410
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,490
如果你不放我走，我弟弟会杀了你。
If you don't let me go, my brother will kill you.

411
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:12,220
我就希望这会煽起他仇恨的火焰――
I only hope that this will fan the flames of his hate--

412
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:15,120
可能会激励他采取行动。
might inspire him to action.

413
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,270
否则，我担心他会让我
Otherwise, I fear that he's going to provide

414
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,820
很少或没有挑战。
little or no challenge.

415
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,060
这很好。
That's good.

416
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,530
将会很好玩。
This will be fun.

417
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,950
你认为这个陷阱可靠吗?
Do you think the snare will hold?

418
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,850
听。
Listen.

419
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,520
你听到了吗?
Did you hear that?

420
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,530
是的。
Yeah.

421
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,620
如果泽德或他的机器人现在偶然发现这个陷阱，
If Zed or his droids stumble across this trap now,

422
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,950
我们完蛋。
we're sunk.

423
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,810
他朝这边来了。
He's coming this way.

424
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,450
那是什么?
What was that?

425
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:59,080
它不是泽德。
It wasn't Zed.

426
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,850
那东西看起来像是某种突变体。
That thing looked like some kind of mutant.

427
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,620
我觉得这丛林里还有更多古怪
Something tells me there's more in this jungle

428
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:06,680
比看到的要多。
than meets the eye.

429
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,670
你注意到小路上那棵倒下的树了吗?
Did you notice that fallen tree back there on the path?

430
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:11,210
很难错过，我们从下面走过。
Hard to miss. We walked under it.

431
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:14,270
如果我们砍掉支撑树枝，设置绊索藤蔓，
If we cut away the supporting branches or rig a trip vine,

432
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,540
这将是一个完美的陷阱。
it would make a perfect deadfall.

433
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,750
希望我们在黎明前还有足够的时间。
Hope we've got enough time left before dawn.

434
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,450
让我们做做看。
Let's find out.

435
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:09,640
如果有一把像样的刀，只需要一半的时间。
It would have taken half as long with a decent knife.

436
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,700
这个绊索有多敏感?
How sensitive is this trip wire?

437
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,360
轻轻碰一下藤蔓，这红木
The slightest touch on that vine and the mahogany log

438
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,620
会轰然倒塌，压碎它下面的任何东西。
comes crashing down, crushing anything beneath it.

439
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,760
那我们的赌注就全押在泽德是下一个
Then our whole bet rides on Zed being the next living

440
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,910
走上这条路的活物。
creature down this path.

441
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:24,130
我们别无选择，只能再次赌运气。
Just another chance we've got no choice but to take.

442
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:25,950
你知道吗，你不是唯一之前感觉
You know, you aren't the only one under the impression

443
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:28,670
泽德是这个星球上唯一居民的人。
that Zed was the sole inhabitant of this planet.

444
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:32,310
最近几小时显示情况不同。
The last few hours tell a different story.

445
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,740
我想知道还有什么生物在走路，在爬行，
I wonder what else is walking, crawling,

446
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,190
或者在外面滑行。
or slithering around out there.

447
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,660
时间会告诉我们。
Time will tell.

448
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,280
我们现在能做的就这了。
This is all we can do for now.

449
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,000
让我们回去。
Let's head back.

450
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:34,940
克雷尔，恐怕我们需要约束一下希拉。
Krel, I'm afraid we need to keep Shela under restraint.

451
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:39,090
如果她醒了，她可能会惊动我们的其他访客，
If she awakens, she is likely to alarm our other visitors,

452
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:40,310
除非我们让她舒服待在这里。
unless we keep her comfortable here.

453
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,150
太阳已经升起来了。
The sun is up already.

454
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:49,740
我们还有很长的路要走。
We've still got a ways to go yet.

455
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,420
这比我想的要长。
This is taking longer than I thought.

456
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,550
昨晚好像没这么远，即使是摸黑走。
It didn't seem this far last night, even in the dark.

457
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,160
不久我们就会被想念。
It won't be long before we're missed.

458
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,430
来吧。
Come on.

459
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:01,350
瓦克，检查楼上的房间。
Vak, check the upstairs rooms.

460
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:04,280
确保我们所有的客人都安全地睡在床上。
Make sure all of our guests are safely in their beds.

461
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:26,070
多么美好的一天。
What a delicious day it is.

462
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:28,810
早上游泳再合适不过了。
It's just perfect for a morning swim.

463
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:31,030
你不陪我一起去吗?
Won't you come with me?

464
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:34,190
泽德说丛林里充满了危险。
Zed says the jungle is just full of danger.

465
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:37,580
我会觉得安全好多，有像你这样又大又壮的机器人
I'd feel a whole lot safer with a big, strong android like you

466
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:40,060
来保护我。
along to protect me.

467
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:43,420
当然，我没有泳衣。
Of course, I haven't got a swimsuit.

468
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,370
但我相信你不会介意的。
But I'm sure you won't mind.

469
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:48,190
我需要检查楼上的客房。
I need to check the guest rooms upstairs.

470
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,360
何苦呢?
Why bother?

471
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,840
每个人都还在睡觉。
Everyone's still asleep.

472
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,600
我是唯一一个精力无处发泄的人
I'm the only one who's bright-eyed and bushy-tailed

473
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,500
今天早上。
this morning.

474
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,220
来吧。
Come on.

475
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,380
我们走吧。
Let's go.

476
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,970
我有命令。
I have my orders.

477
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,000
好吧，如果你现在不来，我就一个人去。
Well, if you're not coming now, I'm going alone.

478
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:28,320
克雷尔，该去海滩巡逻了。
Krel, it's time to patrol the beaches again.

479
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,450
通知我，如果你发现什么异常情况
Send word to me if you spot anything unusual

480
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:33,210
或者我可能感兴趣的事，但只限于
or I might be interested in, but only

481
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:34,430
值得叫醒我的情况。
if it's worth waking me for.

482
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,130
你确定这条路是对的吗?
Are you sure this is the right trail?

483
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:45,090
我什么都不确定了。
I'm not sure about anything anymore.

484
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:52,460
就在这里。
Just about here.

485
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:55,390
现在，你就在这里等着，我去泡个澡。
Now, you just wait right here while I go take a dip.

486
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,410
你在这儿干什么?
What are you doing here?

487
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,430
看她。
Watching her.

488
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,290
主人命令你检查楼上的房间。
The master ordered you to check the upstairs rooms.

489
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:22,970
家里一切正常。
Everything at the house is in order.

490
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,350
你亲眼看到了吗?
Did you see for yourself?

491
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,180
嗯,哦,不。
Well, uh, no.

492
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,830
我想你应该守着房子。
I think you should be guarding the house.

493
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:28,850
你想?
You think?

494
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,980
你从来没有想过你的整个存在意义。
You've never thought for your entire existence.

495
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,090
你在骂人。
You are insulting.

496
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,670
你说得对。
You are correct.

497
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,940
我们怎么从他们身边溜过去?
How are we going to sneak past them?

498
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,100
他们就在我们下面。
They're right below us.

499
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,400
希望我能引起蒂莎的注意
Let's hope I can get Tisa's attention

500
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,310
在铬合金机器人发现我们之前。
before the chrome domes spot us.

501
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,040
蒂莎！蒂莎！
(WHISPERING) Tisa! Tisa!

502
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:52,490
蒂莎！
Tisa!

503
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,930
你应该回屋去。
You should return to the house.

504
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,960
我不听你的命令。
I don't take orders from you.

505
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,870
瓦克，有什么不对吗?
Vak, is anything wrong?

506
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,680
我希望我没有造成任何麻烦。
I hope I haven't caused any trouble.

507
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,330
没。没有问题。
No. No problem.

508
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:10,810
能把我的毛巾给我吗?
Could you bring me my towel?

509
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:20,260
你不在主人会不高兴的。
The master will not be pleased with your absence.

510
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:23,820
你让我不高兴，我不理你。
You displease me, and I ignore you.

511
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,400
瓦克，别管毛巾了。
Vak, never mind the towel.

512
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,930
我要再呆一会儿。
I'm going to stay in a little longer.

513
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:36,940
我要通知主人。
I'm going to inform the master.

514
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,000
打小报告的!
Tattletale!

515
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,380
脱衣服。
Take off your shirt.

516
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:58,290
快快快!
Go, go, go!

517
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,530
必须让人相信。
This has to be convincing.

518
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:09,640
我信了。
I'm convinced.

519
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,240
哦。
Aw.

520
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,050
哦。呃。
Oh. Uh.

521
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:57,810
男人和女人――一个伟大的概念。
Man and woman-- a great concept.

522
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:00,250
我爱它。
I love it.

523
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:05,320
直到现在我才知道我有多想做爱。
I never knew how much I missed making love until just now.

524
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,110
至少可以说，我最近饱受磨难。
I've been through a lot lately, to say the least.

525
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,690
你让我觉得自己又活过来了。
You made me feel alive again.

526
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:17,580
我知道我想要什么。
I know what I want.

527
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:20,570
我知道我在为什么战斗。
I know what it is I'm fighting for.

528
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:21,270
谢谢。
Thanks.

529
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:29,080
你不用谢我。
You don't have to thank me.

530
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,230
这是我的荣幸。
It was my pleasure.

531
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,280
如果我今天死了，我也毫无怨言。
If I die today, I wouldn't complain.

532
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:42,710
现在，这一刻，我一定是最快乐的男人
Right now, this moment, I have to be the happiest guy

533
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,810
在宇宙中。
in the universe.

534
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:17,650
毫无疑问，你一直想知道你姐姐的情况。
No doubt you've been wondering about your sister.

535
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:21,400
她是我的囚犯。
She's my prisoner.

536
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:25,730
给你机会。
Here's your chance.

537
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,630
枪上有定时器，10分钟内不会激活。
Timer on the gun won't activate for 10 minutes.

538
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,610
我允许你先走一步。
I'm allowing you that much head start.

539
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:46,190
如果你能一直躲到天亮，或者杀了我，
If you can elude me until dawn, or kill me,

540
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:50,780
那么你赢得了你的自由，和她的自由。
then you've won your freedom, and hers.

541
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,430
你会后悔的。
You'll regret this.

542
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:55,120
这不是一个特别新颖的回应，
Not a particularly original response,

543
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,780
但我相信它是真诚的
but I am sure that it is a sincere

544
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:00,720
表达了你的感受。
expression of your feelings.

545
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,730
我建议你快点。
I suggest you hurry.

546
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:04,460
你的时间不多了。
Your time is running out.

547
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:38,470
哦。
Aw.

548
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:34,070
迷药很快就会失效。
The drug will wear off quickly.

549
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:39,160
我不想以任何方式影响你们的活泼性。
I wouldn't want to compromise your alertness in any way.

550
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:43,690
那就违背了我的初衷。
That would defeat my entire purpose.

551
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:47,230
你是个没人性的恶魔。
You're an inhuman fiend.

552
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:54,240
没有必要把那给她看。
There was no need to show that to her.

553
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,830
我们都有不同的需求
We all have different needs--

554
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:00,430
我们中的一些人，非常不同。
some of us, very different.

555
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:08,280
我的刺激体验，非常特别――
Experiences which stimulate me, singularly specific--

556
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,310
我有自己独特的哲学，
I have my own special philosophy,

557
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:13,600
符合我独特的生活方式。
consistent with my unique lifestyle.

558
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:22,800
我总觉得生命最美好的时光离死亡最近。
I've always felt that the best of life lies closest to death.

559
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,350
生活在边缘――
Living on the edge--

560
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:28,050
那里你找到生活的刺激。
that's where you find the thrill of life.

561
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:30,690
我完全不同意你的看法。
I couldn't agree with you less.

562
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:34,370
生命的美好在于尽可能远离死亡。
The best of life lies as far from death as possible.

563
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:37,410
最终，没有人能赢得生命的游戏。
In the end, no one wins the game of life.

564
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:38,970
是的。
Yes.

565
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:42,000
但我还是希望输得越慢越好。
But I prefer to lose as slowly as I can.

566
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:48,680
你有机会把你的哲学和我的哲学相比较
You'll have your chance to pit your philosophy against mine--

567
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,400
较量技巧一分高下
a contest of skills played on the chess

568
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:55,740
在我的私人星球棋盘上。
board of my private planet.

569
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:58,750
我打算狩猎你们。
I intend to hunt you.

570
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,640
你不是认真的吧。
You can't be serious.

571
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,300
你不会真要狩猎女人吧?
You're not going to hunt women, are you?

572
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,140
我总是发现这个物种的雌性
I've always found the female of the species

573
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:06,840
带来最大的挑战，
to be the greatest challenge, far

574
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:11,820
远比男性对手更诡计多端。
more crafty and cunning than their male counterparts.

575
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:17,130
她们狡猾，不可预测，充满惊喜
They're devious, unpredictable, full of surprises--

576
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:18,610
美妙的惊喜。
wonderful surprises.

577
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:24,530
我会尽量让你猜不透。
I'll do my best to keep you guessing.

578
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:27,550
我将同时释放你们三个。
I'm going to release the three of you simultaneously.

579
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:30,750
我将给你们猎刀，让你们先走一小时。
I'm going to give you hunting knives and an hour head start.

580
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:33,400
在我的岛的远端有一座寺庙
There's a temple on the far side of my island containing

581
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,220
存有高能激光武器。
high-powered laser weapons.

582
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:38,990
如果你们能成功走那么远，那些武器会给你们
If you can make it that far, those weapons will give you

583
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:40,670
更多的生机。
more than a fighting chance.

584
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:47,210
这是一张去寺庙的地图。
Here is a map with directions to the temple.

585
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:54,960
还有最后的床第请求吗?
Any last plea for compassion?

586
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,790
你不能这么做。
You can't do this.

587
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:59,400
生命太宝贵，不能为娱乐被屠宰。
Life is too precious to be killed for sport.

588
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,830
这是一个冰冷的宇宙。
It's a cold cosmos.

589
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:07,320
给你们尖牙利爪。
Here are your claws and fangs.

590
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,750
我希望你们三个提供给我
I expect the three of you to provide

591
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:16,630
非比寻常的挑战。
me with an unusual challenge.

592
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:18,550
我们将努力不辜负你的期望。
We'll try to live up to your expectations.

593
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:29,750
我会把自己限制在我最喜欢的轻武器上
I'm going to limit myself to my favorite light weapons--

594
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:30,990
手枪弩。
pistol crossbows.

595
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:34,350
你真慷慨，让这么多子。
Generous of you to handicap yourself so severely.

596
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:37,980
我想给你们一切打败我的机会。
ZED: I want to give you every opportunity to beat me.

597
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:42,740
这也激发了我的竞争本能。
Even that stimulates my competitive instincts.

598
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:45,510
我要好好享受这一切。
I am going to enjoy this.

599
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:47,770
我帮不上这个忙。
Not if I can help it.

600
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:51,190
我建议我们不要再浪费时间了。
I suggest we waste no more time.

601
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:54,120
良好的开端意味着一切。
A good head start is everything.

602
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,920
给一个忠告
One word of advice--

603
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,290
尽量不要在幽灵区迷路。
try not to get lost in the phantom zone.

604
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,090
我想把这把刀插进他的心脏。
SHELA: I want to bury this knife in his heart.

605
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,590
我要在这里等泽德，然后伏击他。
I'm going to wait for Zed right here and ambush him.

606
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:20,020
他绝不会想到。
He'd never expect it.

607
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,760
你绝不会知道怎么死的。
You'd never know what hit you.

608
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,970
我们唯一的希望就是团结一致。
Our only hope is to stick together.

609
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:26,770
单打独斗，他只要一次干掉我们一个人。
Alone, he'll only pick us off one at a time.

610
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:28,350
我们三个人人多力量大。
The three of us outnumber him.

611
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,700
陷阱就在前面。
The trap lies just ahead.

612
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:50,530
这个陷阱帮不上我们忙了。
This trap isn't going to do us any good.

613
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:53,010
至少我们不会在路上碰到他了。
At least we won't be running into him on the trail.

614
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:56,510
是啊，但他的伴侣可能不太高兴。
Yeah, but his mate might not be too happy about this.

615
00:50:56,510 --> 00:51:00,520
让我看看那张地图。
Let me take a look at that map.

616
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,470
应该是这条路。
This should be the way.

617
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:06,810
你比我更需要丰胸。
You need this more than I do.

618
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:18,810
只要一碰隐藏的绊索藤蔓，
Just touch that hidden trip vine,

619
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:22,470
10吨重的树就压在你的身上。
and you have 10 tons of tree in your lap.

620
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:25,230
这是一个我宁愿避免的头痛。
That's one headache I'd rather avoid.

621
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:28,800
- 小心脚下! - 我会蹑手蹑脚。
- Watch your step! - I'll tiptoe.

622
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:39,770
看来我们已经走了很远了。
It seems as though we've come miles.

623
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:42,370
在这么稠密的丛林里一个小时走不了多远。
An hour doesn't take you far in jungle this dense.

624
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:44,040
泽德现在应该已经出发了。
Zed should be starting out about now.

625
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,500
他会很快追来。
He'll be coming fast.

626
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,350
让我看看地图，确定一下我们的方位。
Let me check the map and get our bearings.

627
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:48,850
它不在这里。
It's not here.

628
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:51,500
它一定是掉在路上了。
It must have fallen out somewhere along the path.

629
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,360
不奇怪它滑落了。
It's no wonder it slipped through.

630
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,370
我应该自己塞着它。
I should have held onto it myself.

631
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:57,050
- 我们一起回去找。- 不。
- Let's go back together. - No.

632
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:57,840
我丢的。
I lost it.

633
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,400
我去找。继续走。
I'll find it. Stick to the path.

634
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,010
我会赶上你们的。
I'll catch up with you.

635
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:03,010
当心陷阱。
Watch out for the deadfall.

636
00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:04,810
这就像她要把自己碾碎一样。
It would be just like her to get herself crushed.

637
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:31,730
我累了。
I'm tired.

638
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,160
我受够了。
I'm sick of this.

639
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,150
我不想为我的生命而战了。
I don't want to have to fight for my life.

640
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:42,520
考虑另一选择。
Consider the alternative.

641
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:45,160
泽德的战利品室里的头颅看起来不太高兴。
Those heads in Zed's trophy room didn't look too happy to me.

642
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,140
我受够了这么害怕。
I am tired of being so scared.

643
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:50,000
瑞克的事我很同情。
I'm sorry about Rik.

644
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,480
我知道同情改变不了什么
I know sorry doesn't change anything,

645
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,500
但我还是想让你知道我的感觉。
but I want you to know how I feel, just the same.

646
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,710
谢谢。
Thanks.

647
00:52:56,710 --> 00:53:00,250
突然之间，简单的人类温情意义重大。
Suddenly, simple human warmth means a lot.

648
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:02,890
在这一切发生之前，我从不知道我如此需要朋友。
I never knew I needed friends so much before all this happened.

649
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:25,270
我们已经侦查得够远了
Well, we've scouted far enough ahead to see

650
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:27,010
明白了这条路的走向。
what this trail has to offer.

651
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:29,370
我们回去在峡谷边等蒂莎怎么样?
What do you say we go back and wait for Tisa by the chasm?

652
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:31,320
半路接应她?
Meet her halfway?

653
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,240
我不想让泽德追上她时我们不在她身边
I don't want Zed catching up with her without us

654
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,100
支援她。
there to back her up.

655
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:30,670
如果泽德发现了蒂莎，她没机会生还。
If Zed spots Tisa, she won't stand a chance.

656
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:31,710
我们得把他引开。
We've got to flush him out.

657
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:32,550
但如何?
But how?

658
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:36,550
只有一个办法。
There's only one way.

659
00:56:59,570 --> 00:57:02,010
她不该这样惨死。
She deserved better than this.

660
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:04,930
她为我牺牲了自己。
She sacrificed herself for me.

661
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:08,370
命运女神肯定在胡乱织锦。
Fate certainly weaves a twisted tapestry.

662
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:10,320
如果奴隶贩子们从我们身边经过就好了。
If only the slavers had passed us by.

663
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,260
如果，如果，我受够了如果。
If, if-- I'm sick of ifs.

664
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:14,810
如果生活不是那么残酷，一切多美好。
If life wasn't so cruel, everything would be beautiful.

665
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:16,160
生活才不在乎。
Life doesn't care.

666
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,360
看看这片丛林。
Look at this jungle.

667
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:20,630
它里面的一切生物通过杀死别的生物而生存
Everything in it survives by killing something else--

668
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:23,700
不是出于选择，而是出于环境。
not by choice, just by circumstance.

669
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,070
泽德杀戮是出于选择。
Zed kills by choice.

670
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:26,660
我也选定了。
So will I.

671
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:28,410
我们要回去结果泽德吗?
Do we go back and finish Zed off?

672
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:29,540
用这些吗?
With these?

673
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:32,640
那尖桩可能会让他慢下来，但阻止不了他。
That spike may slow him down, but it won't stop him.

674
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,180
他拿着那些小弩太难对付了。
He's too hot with those little crossbows to suit me.

675
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:37,780
我们就是活靶子。
And we make such attractive targets.

676
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:41,320
我渴望得到一些真正的武器。
I'm itching to get my hands on some serious weapons.

677
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:44,080
能保证这寺庙存在吗?
Is there any guarantee this temple even exists?

678
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,370
那我们又损失什么呢?
Well, what have we got to lose?

679
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:47,280
不用回答这问题。
Don't answer that.

680
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:54,380
你曾梦想过生活会变成这样吗?
Did you ever dream life would turn out like this?

681
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:55,970
一百万年也想不到。
Never in a million years.

682
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:57,470
一百万年。
A million years.

683
00:57:57,470 --> 00:57:59,160
如果我们能活到天亮，我就谢天谢地了。
I'll be thankful if we survive until dawn.

684
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,030
这一定是扳机石，但什么也没发生。
This must be the keystone, but nothing's happening.

685
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:32,510
如果这机械装置不再运转了呢?
What if this mechanism no longer operates?

686
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:43,830
从生到死是人所能及。
From life to death is the reach of man.

687
00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:50,000
如果这个面板代表死亡，那么我猜
If this panel represents death, then my guess

688
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,790
相邻的面板代表生命。
is the adjacent panel represents life.

689
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:58,220
现在，蒂莎，当我说开始时，我们推两个面板
Now, Tisa, when I say go, we push both panels

690
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:01,350
同时，好吗？开始！
at the same time, OK? Go!

691
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:27,700
这一定是泽德警告过我们的幽灵区。
This must be the phantom zone Zed warned us about.

692
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:29,240
他真体贴，没有说
Considerate of him not to mention

693
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,130
幽灵区包围着武器。
it surrounds the weapons.

694
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:34,000
我有奇怪的感觉，时间和空间的正常规律
I have the strangest feeling the normal laws of time and space

695
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,790
不再适用。
no longer apply.

696
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:39,240
如果我们分开了――蒂莎?
If we get separated-- Tisa?

697
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:44,220
蒂莎?
[ECHOING] Tisa?

698
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:48,710
蒂莎?
Tisa?

699
01:00:58,720 --> 01:00:59,420
蒂莎?
Tisa?

700
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,830
你没事吧?
Are you all right?

701
01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:05,270
我做过的噩梦都没有这么可怕。
I've had nightmares that weren't as scary as this.

702
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:06,740
不要碰它。
Don't touch it.

703
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:08,930
一开始我就是这样激活他的。
That's how I activated him in the first place.

704
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:10,760
他被激光打成筛子了。
He's ventilated with laser holes.

705
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,230
他现在是历史了。
He is history now.

706
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:14,050
历史总有办法重演。
History has a way of repeating itself.

707
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:14,750
哦,是吗?
Oh yeah?

708
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:28,380
这里有一些东西将帮助我们改变
Here are some things which will help us change

709
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:29,850
未来的进程。
the course of the future.

710
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:33,810
自助。
Help yourself.

711
01:02:55,590 --> 01:02:57,510
我们还得想办法出去
We've still got to find a way out

712
01:02:57,510 --> 01:02:59,670
在更多尖叫恶魔
of here before any more screaming demons

713
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:01,840
从雾中飞过来之前。
come flying through the fog.

714
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,520
我们什么也看不见。
We can't see a thing.

715
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:06,880
这意味着我们将不得不使用我们的其他感官――
Which means we'll have to use our other senses--

716
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,390
超声波定位。
supersonic psycussion.

717
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:10,630
怎么用?
What about it?

718
01:03:10,630 --> 01:03:12,310
这就是答案。
That's the answer.

719
01:03:12,310 --> 01:03:14,810
这武器发出致命的声波。
This emits deadly sonic shock waves.

720
01:03:14,810 --> 01:03:19,330
如果我360度开火
If I fire in a 360-degree pattern--

721
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:21,390
没有回声的射击方向
The shot that doesn't echo back

722
01:03:21,390 --> 01:03:23,910
就是通向外界的方向。
will be the direction of the opening to the outside.

723
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:26,220
完全正确。
Exactly.

724
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:29,720
让我们做它!
Let's do it!

725
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:33,590
你认为我们有机会吗?
Do you think we have a chance?

726
01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:34,690
我知道我们有。
I know we do.

727
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:58,890
必须找到她。
Have to find her.

728
01:04:58,890 --> 01:05:01,360
必须找到她。在哪里?
Have to find her. Where?

729
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,050
死亡总是令人难以置信――
Death is always incredible--

730
01:05:52,050 --> 01:05:54,640
永远以为是别人，从没想到是自己。
always for others, never for ourselves.

731
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:11,130
这个的点火装置在哪里?
Where's the ignition on this one?

732
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:12,720
它用声音激活。
It's voice activated.

733
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,140
这对你来说应该不成问题。
That shouldn't be any problem for you.

734
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:22,260
幻影驱动已开。
Phantom drive is engaged.

735
01:08:43,550 --> 01:08:44,540
引擎已热。
Engine's hot.

736
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:59,390
我们走!
Let's go!

737
01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:09,290
右舵，左舵。
Right rudder, left rudder.

738
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:11,290
下降20度。
Descend 20 degrees.

739
01:09:13,050 --> 01:09:13,840
减速。
Slow down.

740
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:14,960
我们要撞到那东西。
We're going to hit that thing.

741
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:26,010
拉起！拉起！
Pull up! Pull up!

742
01:09:26,010 --> 01:09:27,760
你的驾驶谁教的?
Who taught you how to drive?

743
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:29,430
快带我们离开这里！快！
Get us out of here, fast!

744
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:41,500
我们有必要偷这么贵的船吗?
Did we have to steal such an expensive ship?

745
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:43,720
你知道造这些东西在厂里要花多少时间吗?
Do you know how much time these things spend in the shop?

746
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:02,110
那事情结束了。
That was close.

747
01:10:02,110 --> 01:10:04,290
现在我们做什么?
Now what do we do?

748
01:10:04,290 --> 01:10:08,520
我们的宇宙浩瀚无垠，充满了奇迹。
Our universe is vast, full of wonders.

749
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:14,230
我们将一起探索，发现陌生的新世界。
We'll explore, find strange, new worlds, together.
