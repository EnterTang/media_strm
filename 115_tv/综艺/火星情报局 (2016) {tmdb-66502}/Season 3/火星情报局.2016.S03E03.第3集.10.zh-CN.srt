1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,110
漫威《神盾局特工》前情回顾
Previously on "Marvel's Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D."...

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:04,470
所以你觉得巨石是个传送门
So you think the rock is a portal?

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,420
是时空中的一道裂缝  带走了西蒙斯
A crack in space-time that carried Simmons away...

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,290
去了另一个星球
to another planet.

5
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,240
菲兹
Fitz!

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:08,930
也就是说
Which means...

7
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:09,860
她就在那里
She's out there.

8
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,270
九头蛇已四分五裂
Hydra's fractured, in pieces.

9
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,110
我们要重建它  好好重建
We're gonna rebuild it... the right way...

10
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,940
-你想怎么打入  -从下方
- What's your way in? - From below.

11
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,830
一步步往上爬  九头蛇万岁什么的
Climb the ranks. Hail Hydra and all that.

12
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,550
我要从这些军火贩那里抢一批弹头
I'm gonna nab a payload from these gunrunners

13
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,810
好建立伪装身份
to establish my cover.

14
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,000
我知道你想在这里建立生活
I get that you're trying to build a life here...

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,700
是啊  正常生活  你就别来插手了
Yes, a normal life, so stay out of it,

16
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,220
建立了一支特遣队
I have created a special task force

17
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,820
ATCU  专门应对美国本土的外星威胁
the ATCU, to neutralize these alien threats on our soil.

18
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:33,600
跟我们走吧
Come with us.

19
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,240
我们能保护你  你现在有危险
We'll keep you safe. Your life is in danger.

20
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,450
我的生活毁了
My life is in ruins.

21
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,110
他在朝北边跑
He's moving north!

22
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,460
有必要可进行致命打击
Use lethal force if necessary!

23
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,510
我跟住他了
I'm on his trail.

24
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,470
快走
Move it, move it!

25
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:18,400
那边
There.

26
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,670
站住
Stop!

27
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,950
后退
Fall back!

28
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,780
第二小组试着拦截他
Unit two ?can try and head him off.

29
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,380
给她打电话
But get her on the phone.

30
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,210
告诉她我们跟丢了
Tell her we lost him.

31
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,800
得叫上所有人了
It's time to bring ?everyone in on this.

32
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,750
西蒙斯不必被隔离
Simmons didn't have to go through quarantine,

33
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,240
总的来说  这是好事
which is good, all things considered.

34
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,800
我们究竟要考虑些什么
What exactly are these things that we're considering?

35
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,280
在另一个星球上待了数月的一切可能后果
Everything that comes with being on another planet for months.

36
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,980
不同的大气层  不同水平的氧化
Different atmosphere, different levels of oxygenation,

37
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,550
不同的微重力
different microgravity.

38
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,240
她体内的所有系统都紊乱了
Every system in her body's out of whack.

39
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,270
心血管  内耳  呼吸系统
Cardiovascular, inner ear, respiratory

40
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,810
都已经习惯了另一个地方
all got used to being... not here.

41
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,450
实验室结果显示她有氧化应激症  缺乏维生素D
Labs indicate oxidative stress, vitamin D deficiency,

42
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,240
上呼吸道刺激
upper-respiratory irritation.

43
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,840
她有提到生命体吗  智慧生命或者别的
Any mention of life, intelligent or otherwise?

44
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,730
有些植物  没有动物
Some flora, no fauna.

45
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,840
她说她在被追杀
She said she was being hunted.

46
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,970
等等  什么   什么意思
Wait. What? What does that mean?

47
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,670
被什么追杀
Hunted by what?

48
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,880
她没说  我都不确定她自己是否知道
She didn't say. I don't know if she even knows. ?

49
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,770
天哪
My god.

50
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,680
想想她一个人经历了那一切  还那么久
Imagine her having to go through all that alone for that long.

51
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,530
多亏了这家伙  她回来了
Well, thanks to this guy, not anymore.

52
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,480
监测她的身体健康
Monitor her physical health.

53
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,010
我和加纳博士通了电话
I've got a call in to Dr. Garner.

54
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,050
她的心理健康同样重要
Her mental health is just as important.

55
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,750
但别逼她
But don't push her.

56
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,320
准备好后她会说的
She'll open up when she's ready.

57
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,190
林肯有麻烦了
Lincoln's in trouble.

58
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,990
ATCU发布了一条全国警戒
The ATCU issued a nationwide BOLO...

59
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,490
联调局  国土安全部  地方警察
FBI, homeland security, local police...

60
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,320
都收到了通知
all notified.

61
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,300
发给了他们林肯的简历和头像
Sent 'em Lincoln's résumé and head shot.

62
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,310
听起来ATCU不顾一切了
Sounds like the ATCU's getting desperate.

63
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,760
找到他后他们要干吗
What are they gonna do when they find him?

64
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,660
肯定没好事  他需要帮助
I'm guessing it won't be awesome. He needs help.

65
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,960
我们找过林肯不止一次了
Look, we went to Lincoln more than once.

66
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:43,960
他不要我们帮忙
He didn't want our help.

67
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,730
那不代表他就该像个逃犯一样被追捕
It doesn't mean he deserves to be hunted like a fugitive,

68
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,830
更何况还有个充满怨恨的巨人
not to mention there's a giant with a grudge

69
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:49,610
想要杀他呢
looking to kill him.

70
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,830
所以咱们得带他回来  刻不容缓
Which is why we need to bring him in -- now.

71
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,230
那也得知道他在哪才行
That would be the plan if we knew where to find him,

72
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,250
可他不回我信息  而且我...
But he's not messaging me back, and I --

73
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,210
怎么了
What?

74
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,080
要不你来告诉她
You want to tell her?

75
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,940
好吧  告诉我什么
Great. Tell me what?

76
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,960
你俩有什么事都不想告诉我
What do neither of you want to tell me?

77
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,450
我们知道怎么找他
We know how to find him.

78
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,930
林肯  是我
Lincoln, it's me.

79
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,230
黛西
Daisy?

80
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,870
你怎么知道这号码的
How the hell did you get this number?

81
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:22,800
这不重要
That's not important.

82
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,170
现在重要的是你得找个安全的地方
What's important right now is that you get somewhere safe.

83
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,240
这电话是我刚买的
I just bought this phone.

84
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,950
我知道
Yes, I know.

85
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,070
35分钟前  在71街和宾福德街一家酒铺买的
35 minutes ago at a liquor store at 71st and Binford.

86
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,180
你知道我在哪
You know where I am?

87
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,400
知道  而且我说服了他们让我先跟你谈...
Yes, and I convinced them to let me talk to you before --

88
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,470
真不敢相信你会这么做
I can't believe you would do this.

89
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,120
林肯  听我说完  好吗
Just -- Lincoln, just hear me out, okay?

90
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,850
ATCU已经把你的照片发给了执法机关
The ATCU has released your picture to law enforcement.

91
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,350
现在到处都在缉拿你
It's everywhere, calling for your arrest.

92
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,870
我们会来接你
We're gonna come get you.

93
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,190
林肯
Lincoln?

94
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,570
我搭档没说完你别想走
You're not walking out of here till my partner has said her piece.

95
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,880
他肯定把追踪器烧了
He must have blown his tracker.

96
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,890
当然  因为他对自己被装了追踪器感到害怕
Yeah, because he's creeped out that you put a tracker in him.

97
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,210
是啊  要不是她告诉了他
Yeah, and if she didn't give him a heads-up,

98
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,490
我们就能利用追踪器把他带回来了
we could have used it to bring him in.

99
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,280
他已经很恐慌  疑神疑鬼了
He's already scared, paranoid.

100
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,460
搞突然袭击只会适得其反
Ambushing him out of nowhere would have made things way worse.

101
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,300
那他就可以在我们这里释放他的情绪
And he would have been able to express those feelings

102
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,780
而这里很安全
to us here, secure in our location.

103
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,070
好了  大家都别紧张
All right, all right. Everybody, just relax.

104
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,540
我们会有办法的
We'll figure this out.

105
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,970
马萨诸塞州  阿尔斯顿

106
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,460
他应该在这里
He should be in here.

107
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,750
我们之前一起合作过
We did a couple of jobs together a while back.

108
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,270
他在英国时和九头蛇关系密切
He's tight with Hydra in the U.K.

109
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,550
搬到美国之后
And continued his association

110
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,530
还继续跟他们有联系
when he relocated here to the U.S.

111
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,010
他在那儿
There he is.

112
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,460
你先请
You lead.

113
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,150
斯巴德
Spud.

114
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,510
怎么会  瑞奇
Why, here's Richy!

115
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,380
真没想到啊
As I live and breathe!

116
00:05:58,410 --> 00:05:59,500
胡子挺帅啊
?Working the bum fluff.

117
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,250
吉娜  这是斯巴德
Oh, G-Gina, Spud.

118
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:01,990
斯巴德  这是吉娜
Spud, Gina.

119
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,610
你这种人也能泡到这种美女
Classy for the likes of you, eh?

120
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,600
只是生意伙伴
Business associates.

121
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,320
来抱一抱
Come here.

122
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,230
第一轮酒算我的
First round's on me.

123
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,390
好极了
Oh, nice one. ?

124
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,890
瑞奇跟我们说如果有货出手
Uh, so, Richy tells us you're the guy to go to

125
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:20,800
-找你就对了  -别着急
- if we need to unload-- ?- Hold your horses.

126
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,680
不是这么干的
That's not how it's done.

127
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,650
先喝酒  然后再谈生意
First we drink, then we talk business.

128
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,210
来三杯扎啤
Three pints.

129
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,100
好吧  因为你们还不够难以理解
Right, 'cause you guys aren't hard enough to understand as it is.

130
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,070
糟糕透了

131
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,740
我们坐在拉驴的车里

132
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,940
我和这个家伙

133
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,440
后面是五十条黑市买来的镀镉钢

134
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,140
然后收音机里

135
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,260
你小心点

136
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,560
播起了《爱痕》那首歌  知道那首歌吗

137
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,530
播起了那首歌  而这家伙

138
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,540
这家伙鼻涕眼泪一把流

139
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,050
滚边

140
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,300
那时我未婚妻刚跑了  把我一个人丢下

141
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,270
我都崩溃了

142
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,790
十个小时里  每次那歌一响起

143
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,640
他都哭得抖成一团

144
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,100
是你反复放那首歌  你个笨蛋

145
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,330
说得没错
Yeah, you're right.

146
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,860
我是那么干了
I did, didn't I?

147
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,840
经典的公路旅行啊
And, man, classic road trip.

148
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,920
行了
All right.

149
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,820
他是个白痴
He's a muppet.

150
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,650
如果我们再不进入正题
But if we don't start talking shop soon,

151
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,680
他就要喝醉了  所以...
he's gonna pass out, so --

152
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,090
你有什么要出手的吗
You have something to unload?

153
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,020
新式武器  杀伤力一流
Weapons -- next gen, high potential damage.

154
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,270
我们要的是唯恐天下不乱的有钱买家
We need buyers with deep pockets and bad intentions.

155
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,390
你自然也有佣金拿
A finder's fee for you, of course.

156
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,900
我认识些人...
I know people...

157
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,410
但他们疑心极重
But they have massive trust issues.

158
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,460
他们要什么  推荐信吗
What do they want -- a letter of recommendation?

159
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,670
靠我担保是不够的
?Me vouching won't be enough.

160
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,940
那要怎么的  花钱买路吗
Well, what is? Do I buy my way in?

161
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,000
不是
No.

162
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,170
你要打进去
You fight your way in.

163
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,060
如果你是最后站着的人
If you are the last man standing,

164
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,020
他们就见你
you'll get a meeting.

165
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,350
貌似挺有趣
Sounds like a laugh.

166
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,880
该疑犯是危险分子
The suspect is considered dangerous.

167
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,860
同时受到联邦当局和ATCU的通缉
And he is wanted by both Federal authorities and the ATCU.

168
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,080
事态真是急转直下
This just went from bad to really, really bad.

169
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,500
他们公开了
They've gone public.

170
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,270
如看到此人  切勿与其交手
If you do see this man, do not engage.

171
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,430
另一则新闻  辛辛那提医院
In other news, a suspect has been identified

172
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,920
外星恐怖袭击中的嫌疑人身份已确认
in the Cincinnati hospital alien terrorist attack

173
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,490
袭击造成三人死亡  多人受伤
that left three dead, many more injured.

174
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,410
如果您有照片中此人的消息
If you have any information about the man pictured here,

175
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,520
请联系有关部门
be sure to contact the authorities.

176
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,170
你就是那个人
You're him.

177
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,440
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know ?what you're talking about.

178
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:42,980
我看见你了
I saw you.

179
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,020
我知道你是什么
I know what you are.

180
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,090
你根本不知道
You have no idea.

181
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,100
黛西  你去监控林肯最后出现地点
Daisy, I need you to monitor all law enforcement

182
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,540
附近的执法部门的一举一动
near Lincoln's last known location.

183
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,030
不如我们自己带一队人去找他
How about we take a team, go look for ourselves?

184
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,570
不行  ATCU正到处无故抓捕异能人士
No, the ATCU's on a witch hunt for powered people.

185
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,470
我可不怕他们
I'm not afraid of them.

186
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,000
你是不怕  但他们怕你
No, but they're terrified of you,

187
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,220
这让他们非常危险
which makes them dangerous.

188
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,130
在我们找到他之前你都不能行动
Till we know where he is, you're not going out there.

189
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,460
能说说想法吗
Permission to speak freely.

190
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,580
我有得选吗
Do I have a choice?

191
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,230
如果你没擅自给他植入皮下跟踪器
I could have talked him in if you didn't put

192
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,420
我本可劝他自己投降的
an unsolicited tracker under his skin.

193
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,980
如果你没打电话警告他  那我们...
If you didn't call to alert him, then we --

194
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,960
为什么没跟我说
Why wasn't I told?

195
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,630
我们觉得这事对你来说太切身了
We thought you were a little close to the situation.

196
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,420
当然了
Of course ?I'm close to the situation.

197
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,920
你让我组建一支队伍  我领了任务
You asked me to assemble a team, and I accepted.

198
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,280
我没料到会遭到掣肘
I didn't expect to be undermined and --

199
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,460
你知道什么是我始料不及的吗
Do you know what I didn't expect?

200
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,470
全球异人族爆发
A global outbreak.

201
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,890
ATCU  他们对异人族的追捕
The ATCU, ?their inhuman manhunt --

202
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,770
老实讲  我没料到这会发生
I didn't see all that coming, to be honest.

203
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,240
我想要组建队伍  控制局面
I wanted to assemble a team, to get ahead of the problem,

204
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,330
但事与愿违
but that didn't happen.

205
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,470
所以  黛西
So, Ddaisy...

206
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,490
我去监控执法部门通讯
I'll scan law-enforcement channels.

207
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,050
谢谢
Thank you.

208
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:45,510
迈克  是你查明了罗莎琳・普莱斯的身份
Mack, you were able to identify Rosalind Price's photo.

209
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,120
能给我拿到她的电话吗
?How about getting me her digits?

210
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,240
没问题
You got it.

211
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,820
还在适应重力较小的环境
Still acclimating to less gravity.

212
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,440
这画面真让人开心
Well, now, this is a sight for sore eyes.

213
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,710
我想回到实验室可能有点帮助
Thought it would be good to get back in the lab,

214
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,150
看看老地方
see the old workspace.

215
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,320
就是那个吗
Is that it?

216
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,250
它原来是传送门
It was the portal.

217
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,760
现在是一堆太空岩石
Now it's a pile of space rocks.

218
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,790
我做过了完整彻底的检测
I've run a complete and exhaustive set of diagnostics,

219
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,130
可以向你保证这无须担心
so I can assure you there's no need to worry.

220
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,620
你还好吗
You okay?

221
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,560
-还好  -先失陪了
- Fine. - ?Just a sec.

222
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,130
亨特打来的  他在追捕沃德
It's Hunter. He's on a Ward hunt.

223
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,980
代我问好
Say "Hi."

224
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,190
当然
You know it.

225
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,610
你看
Hey, look.

226
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,450
和你离开时一样
Just as you left it --

227
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,190
就连便贴的位置都没变
Made sure not even a post-it note was moved,

228
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,320
因为我知道你对这些多讲究
'cause I know how particular you can be about it.

229
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,970
怎么了
What is it?

230
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,700
我只是...
Um, I'm just...

231
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:44,210
有这么多杂七杂八的东西不太适应
I'm not accustomed ?to this many distractions.

232
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,130
我想你之前肯定都看花眼了
Yeah, well, I imagine you must have had quite a lot to take in --

233
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,790
要检查外星物质和样本
extraterrestrial materials and specimens to examine.

234
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,770
我一害怕  好奇心就消失了
My curiosity faded once fear set in.

235
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:53,720
对啊
Right.

236
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,020
不  当然了
Yeah, no, of course.

237
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,630
抱歉
Sorry.

238
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:01,110
我得承认  这有点不好承受
Uh, I have to admit -- it's all a bit much.

239
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,220
你介意吗
Would you mind?

240
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,840
不  怎么  要我叫芭比来吗
?Uh, yeah. What -- should I get Bobbi?

241
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,450
不
No.

242
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:09,070
就是有点晕乎乎的
Um, it's just a little disorientation,

243
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,900
可能是因为氧化应激
attributable to oxidative stress.

244
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,840
好  我带你回房间
Okay, yeah, I'll take you back to your room.

245
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,330
希望你不会对我太失望
I hope you're not too disappointed.

246
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,890
不  正相反  你在自我诊断
No, on the contrary, you're self-diagnosing,

247
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,640
说明你在好转
which is a sign you're on the mend.

248
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,130
她现在怎么样了
And how is she now?

249
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,490
你要是困在另一个太阳系中几个月
As weirded out as you'd be after being stranded for months

250
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,490
-也会变得一样奇怪  -我得说
- in another Solar System. - ?Oh, I must say --

251
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:31,310
总部似乎比我们这边有趣多了
HQ sounds a lot more fun than what we're up to.

252
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,920
我怎么就不相信你呢
Now, why don't I believe you?

253
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,770
你为什么听起来宿醉未醒
And why do you sound hung over?

254
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,230
因为我确实宿醉了
Because I am hung over.

255
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,530
在这儿除了喝酒就没别的事可做了
There's nothing to do here but drink.

256
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,920
飞机  火车  汽车  追踪线索
Planes, trains, and automobiles, chasing down leads --

257
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,460
还是没发现沃德的踪迹
Still no sign of Ward.

258
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,140
你没做什么蠢事吧
So, you're not doing anything stupid?

259
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,070
还没
Mm, not yet.

260
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,440
但有一辆火车要出发了
But one of those trains is about to leave the station,

261
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,930
我得赶上那趟车
and I need to get on it.

262
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,370
那祝你好运
Well, good luck.

263
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,020
别死了
Don't die.

264
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,180
我只会无聊死
Only thing I'll die of is boredom.

265
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,490
你对她撒谎了
You lied to her.

266
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:08,740
不算是
Barely.

267
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,330
而且她知道我在撒谎
Besides, she knows I'm lying,

268
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,740
所以这不能算是说谎
so it's not even really a lie.

269
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,170
这样适合我们  目前是这样
Works for us... For now.

270
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,710
你知道的  这些事很复杂
You know how complicated these things can be --

271
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:19,880
感情的事  尤其对干我们这行的来说
Affairs of the heart, especially in our line of work.

272
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,500
我和芭比
Me and Bob.

273
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,350
你和安德鲁
You and Andrew.

274
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:28,620
你信任斯巴德吗
So, do you trust spud?

275
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,840
对一个疯子  没有信任之说
"Trust"'s a strong word for a psychopath.

276
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,030
他是个杀人强盗
He's a murderous thief

277
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,610
我见过他把一个人的鼻子全咬掉了
who I once saw ?bite a man's nose clean off.

278
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,300
但他会帮我们进门的
But he'll get us through the door.

279
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,060
有件事挺逗
You'll find this funny.

280
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,490
之前在总部  我们可是有赌约
Back at H.Q., ?we've got a little wager going

281
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,530
关于你和博士之间的事
on what happened between you and the good doctor.

282
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:49,250
我猜是你离开了  不是因为生气或什么
My guess is you walked away -- not in a huff or anything,

283
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,980
而是受不了没完没了地聊天  分享
just couldn't stand ?the constant talking, sharing.

284
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,030
这倒是真的  我不喜欢说太多
It's true. ?I don't like a lot of talking.

285
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:58,410
这场仗  是我们接近沃德的唯一办法
This fight -- it's our way to Ward,

286
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,780
所以如果你加入  就得赢
so if you're gonna do this, you need to win.

287
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,290
你是觉得我赢不了吗
Are you suggesting I can't win?

288
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:05,160
我不是说你不行  但我知道我能赢
I'm not saying you can't, but I know I can.

289
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,560
斯巴德交的都是一种人
Spud runs with a type.

290
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,400
那种人看到一个小个亚洲女人
If that type see a small Asian woman

291
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,990
赤手空拳地打败了想加入九头蛇的恶棍
destroy some wannabe Hydra thug in a bare-knuckle brawl,

292
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,740
他们会说出去的
that type will talk.

293
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,740
而话可能会往上传
And word might spread up the ranks.

294
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,000
我明白
I see your point.

295
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,010
你只是离开太久
You're just anxious to bash some heads

296
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,760
急着想找人打
after being out of the game.

297
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,090
听着
Look.

298
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,470
我清醒时已经输了一场
I've rarely lost a fight when I'm sober,

299
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,800
我打算保持清醒的
which I plan on being.

300
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,650
我经得住打  即便是糟糕情况
And I can take a punch, so worst case,

301
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,360
我就等到对方打疲了再说
I'll do that ?till the other guy tires out.

302
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,780
你在我离开安德鲁这个赌上
So... How much do you have

303
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,660
压了多少钱
riding on this bet that I left Andrew?

304
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,160
不少呢
A significant sum.

305
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,320
好吧
Well...

306
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,460
你输了
You lost it.

307
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,800
你喝酒了吗
Have you been drinking?

308
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,000
我想的
I wanted to.

309
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,890
但我没有  而是打给了你
Instead, I called you.

310
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,270
你是我唯一信任的人
You're the only one I trust.

311
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,470
上车
Get in.

312
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,640
这趟车搭的可不近啊
It's a hell of a long way for a ride.

313
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,940
我知道
I know.

314
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,270
回去的路费我包了
I'll take care of the tolls on the way back.

315
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,350
一路上你都在睡觉
You slept the whole drive.

316
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,190
我累坏了
I was pretty wiped out.

317
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,640
我有点想听听让你这么累的有趣经历
Yeah, I was kind of hoping for the hilarious tale of why.

318
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,300
你打电话不是为了让我劝你别喝酒
You didn't call to have me talk you off a ledge --

319
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,840
至少这次不是
Not this time, anyway.

320
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,630
林肯  到底发生了什么事
Linc, what's going on?

321
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,010
我惹上了点小麻烦
Ah, I'm in a little bit of trouble.

322
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,670
你可急死我了
You are killing me with these details.

323
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,720
你不会想知道的
You don't want to know.

324
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:07,080
只是个误会
Look, ?it's a misunderstanding.

325
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,290
我向你保证  我没做错任何事
I promise you, ?I haven't done anything wrong.

326
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,120
好  有这句话就够了
Okay, ?that is all I need to hear.

327
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,440
你知道你是什么样的人
I know ?what kind of man you are.

328
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,720
就告诉我你需要什么吧
Just tell me what you need.

329
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,670
我希望
I was hoping, uh...

330
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,350
你可以把车卖给我
You'd let me buy your car off of you.

331
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,420
我知道这不是小事
I know it's a lot to ask.

332
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,860
我会付现金
Uh, I-I'll pay cash.

333
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,810
成交
Done.

334
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,230
约翰  我不知道该说什么好
John, ?I don't know what to say.

335
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:34,920
没关系  稍等一下
All right, now, wait a minute.

336
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,630
你其实是在帮我
You're -- you're doing me a favor. It's a

337
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,040
我的车就是一堆废铜烂铁
pile of rust.

338
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,330
我来做点吃的  好吗
All right? I'll make us some dinner. I don't know.

339
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:40,980
你休息一下
Take a nap,

340
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,020
或者洗个澡  浴室就在那边
or the shower's over there, if you want to take a shower.

341
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,550
我家就是你家
Mi casa, su casa. ?

342
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,760
一切都会好起来的
It's gonna be okay.

343
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,350
通缉危险外星嫌犯

344
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,060
他不可能就那样消失了
?He didn't just disappear...

345
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,640
除非他真的能...
Unless he did.

346
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,400
但是他不能  对吧
Well, he can't do that, can he?

347
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,980
他不能  他的能力是电
No. Electric's his thing.

348
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,460
他会出现的
He'll show.

349
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,490
这就是我们公诸于众的原因
That's why we alerted the public.

350
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,020
他无处藏身了
He's got nowhere to hide.

351
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,240
希望如此
I hope so.

352
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,320
我们需要有进展  出成绩了
We need to start making progogress, showing results.

353
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,650
普莱斯女士  有你的电话
Ms. Price, you have a call.

354
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,110
等下再说
Well, it can wait.

355
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,340
是白宫打来的
It's the White House.

356
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,530
转到我屏幕上吧
Throw it up on my screen.

357
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,740
科尔森
Coulson.

358
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:01,930
叫我菲尔就行
Call me "Phil."

359
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,980
怎么也不能叫你美国总统吧
What I can't call you is POTUS.

360
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,440
你不是唯一在白宫有关系的人
You're not the only person with a connection to the White House.

361
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,050
我的关系是一个马上要被发现的
Well, mine's a pirated satellite connection

362
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,720
盗用卫星连接  所以我就长话短说了
that will be discovered soon, so I'll be brief.

363
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,210
你动静挺大啊
You're making a lot of noise,

364
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,940
说实话  我有点不高兴
and frankly, I'm a little insulted.

365
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,690
你在向所有人寻求帮助
You're asking everyone for help --

366
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:20,040
联调局  地方警察  连公众都惊动了
The FBI, local police, and now the public --

367
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,920
但是就没找真正的知情者
Everyone except the people who actually know something.

368
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,970
-你是说你吗  -就是说我
- You mean you. - ?That is what I mean, yes.

369
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:29,090
所以我觉得我们该见个面  就我们两个
So, I think we should meet, just the two of us --

370
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,080
面对面  找个中点
In person, neutral ground.

371
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,770
稍等我一下
Uh, will you excuse me for a moment?

372
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,250
我们找到林肯・坎贝尔了
We have a location on Lincoln Campbell.

373
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,330
他躲在芝加哥郊外一间公寓里
He's holed up in an apartment outside Chicago.

374
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,400
你知道该怎么做
You know what you need to do.

375
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,990
好吧  菲尔  我们见一面
Okay, Phil, let's meet.

376
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,970
我认为我们有很多东西可谈
I think we'll have a lot to talk about.

377
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,890
真不敢相信你回来了
I cannot believe you're here.

378
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,110
斯凯
Skye.

379
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,360
黛西  不好意思
Daisy. Sorry.

380
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,240
这是个多用途的礼物
It's a multipurpose gift.

381
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,510
既漂亮又能让你想起我
It's pretty and a reminder.

382
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,880
你怎么叫我都可以
You can call me whatever you want.

383
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,640
我不能待太久
I can't stay for too long.

384
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,040
我在监听执法部门的通讯
I'm tracking law-enforcement channels,

385
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,380
但很抱歉我没有早点来看你
but I am really sorry that I haven't come sooner.

386
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,250
就是  最近事情太多了
It's -- there's just a lot going on.

387
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,330
-而且我在一直睡  -这很好
- And I've been sleeping. - Which is good.

388
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,820
你要努力快点好起来
Do whatever you need to get better.

389
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,360
我们需要你
We need you.

390
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,210
我
And I...

391
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,310
我知道你还不想说发生的事
I know you don't want to talk about what happened yet,

392
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,680
但如果你想说  我愿意倾听
But when you do, I'm here for whatever you need.

393
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,020
现在我更想听你说
Right now I'd rather listen.

394
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,370
泰瑞根在扩散吗
The terrigen is spreading?

395
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,140
人们的怀疑也在加剧
So's the paranoia.

396
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,580
和顶层套房的风景不能比
Not exactly the penthouse view.

397
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,840
你在找什么吗
You looking for something?

398
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,700
不是  我只是  很难放松下来
No, I just -- ?it's hard to relax, you know?

399
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,940
我懂
I know.

400
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,860
一切还好吧
Everything okay?

401
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,670
能出什么事呢
Why wouldn't it be?

402
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,820
也许我该去冲个澡
Maybe I will hop in the shower.

403
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,350
约翰  怎么了
John, what's up?

404
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,470
出什么事了
What's wrong?

405
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,560
你站着别动  别碰我
You just stay where you are. Don't touch me.

406
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,540
等等  发生什么事了
Wait. What is going on?

407
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,770
他们很快就来了
They'll be here any minute.

408
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,320
你给谁打了电话
Who did you call?

409
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,800
我打了热线电话
I called the hotline.

410
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,540
他们说你是危险人物
They said that you're dangerous.

411
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,920
林肯  他们说你杀了人
Lincoln, they said that you killed people.

412
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,800
我没杀过人  我发誓
I never killed anyone -- I swear.

413
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,780
你说过你了解我是什么样的人
You said ?you know what type of man I am.

414
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,690
我连你到底是什么都不知道
I don't even know what you are.

415
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,160
他们说你是外星人
They say you're an alien.

416
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,580
完全不是你想的那样
It's not at all what you think.

417
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,960
你别动  别动  我没开玩笑
You just stay there. Stay there! I'm not kidding!

418
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,360
别动  他们随时会来
Stay there. They're gonna be here any minute.

419
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,480
给你
Here.

420
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,970
我把钱留下来  开车走人
I'm gonna leave the money and take the car.

421
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,110
你没必要牵扯进来
You don't need to be involved.

422
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,370
你别过来
Just stay back!

423
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,580
别挡着我
Get out of my way!

424
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,830
对不起我把你牵扯了进来
Sorry I brought you into this.

425
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,270
不要
No.

426
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:09,700
不  不  不
No, no, no, no.

427
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,680
不  约翰
No, John.

428
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,040
拜托  约翰
Come on, john!

429
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,800
你真的没事吗
You're really okay?

430
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,860
我觉得没事  我...
I think so. I'm...

431
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:30,930
只是...
Well, it's just that...

432
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,840
只是有些事很难说出口  还有
There's some of it that's hard to talk about, and, um...

433
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,980
我很抱歉
I am so sorry.

434
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,150
没事  接吧
No. Take it.

435
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,130
黛西
Daisy.

436
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,280
林肯  真对不起
Lincoln, I am so sorry.

437
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,510
我真不知道追踪器的事  否则
I-I had no idea about the tracker, and if I did, I...

438
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,800
别管那个了
?Don't worry about that now.

439
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,460
怎么了
What's wrong?

440
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,040
我需要帮助
I need help.

441
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,460
他不在
He's not here.

442
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,020
林肯躲起来了  他在等我们
Lincoln's hiding. He's waiting for us.

443
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,310
我们得带他回来
We need to bring him in,

444
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,530
最好不被ATCU察觉
preferably without the ATCU knowing.

445
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,920
虽然他刚杀了人吗
Even though he just killed a guy.

446
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,640
我说了  是个意外
I told you... it was an accident.

447
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,290
等他来了我们再说吧
We'll figure it out once we get him in here.

448
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,290
如果让麦克来处理撤离会更安全
It'd be safer if Mack handled the extraction.

449
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:31,120
我知道  但那样他就不会去了  必须我来
I know, but then he won't come. It's got to be me.

450
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,320
你决定
Your call.

451
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,050
你去哪
And where are you going?

452
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,830
海滩
To the beach.

453
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,210
能出勤我什么都愿意做
I'd give anything to be in the field.

454
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,730
复健是刺激的反义词
Rehab is the antithesis of exciting...

455
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,400
我很清楚  但是值得的
I'm well-aware, but it's worth it.

456
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,950
你看我还能说"反义词"这么绕口的词
You notice I was able to say "antithesis."

457
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:54,340
你去看西蒙斯了吗
You check on Simmons?

458
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,210
嗯
Yeah.

459
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:57,210
她有点
She's kind of...

460
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,620
疏远
distant.

461
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,830
我不知道怎么帮她
I'm not sure ?that I know how to help her.

462
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,020
我开始为膝盖做复健时
What did you drill into my head

463
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,450
你反复跟我说的是什么
when I started rehabbing my knee?

464
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,120
-要耐心  -没错
- Patience. - ?Exactly.

465
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,430
嗯  我知道
Yeah, I know. I know.

466
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:11,550
就是实验室...她很热爱实验室的
It's just the lab... she loved that lab,

467
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:15,230
设计全是按照她的具体要求
designed it according to her specifications.

468
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:16,970
可现在
Now it's...

469
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:22,060
或许这让她记起了以前
Could be it reminds her of the way things were...

470
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,800
和她失去的时间
...And all the time she lost.

471
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,690
是啊  这我没想过
Yeah. I didn't think of that.

472
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:30,460
别管那些她曾经在乎的东西了
Maybe forget about the things that used to matter to her.

473
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,790
给她点值得期待的东西
Give her something to look forward to.

474
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:34,890
重新开始
Start fresh.

475
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,730
嗯
Yeah.

476
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,020
或许你说得对  谢谢
Yeah, maybe you're right. Thanks.

477
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:08,800
不得不说  接到你电话时我很意外
Got to say, I was pretty surprised when I got your call.

478
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,470
看这里
Eyes up here.

479
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,890
被你发现了  抱歉
Busted. Sorry.

480
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,010
多谢你抽时间
I appreciate you taking the time.

481
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,730
说说我为什么要开到海边来
Gave me an excuse to drive up the coast.

482
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,920
她有名字吗
Does she have a name?

483
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,300
我爱我的车  但那也就是辆车
I love my car, but it's just a car.

484
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,090
而且是个他
And it's a him.

485
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,850
我们上次见面时
You know, last time we met,

486
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:34,400
你用你的逃脱手段缴了我的械
you, uh, disarmed me with your evasive tactics.

487
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,610
我明白你什么意思
I see what you did there.

488
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,230
不  我得承认
No, I got to hand it to you.

489
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,870
这让我好奇你还有什么本事
Makes me wonder what else you got up your sleeve.

490
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,380
不  我懂的
No, really, I get it.

491
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,920
忍不住
Hard to resist.

492
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,530
我不是第一个了吧
I assume I'm not the first.

493
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:44,680
你就是
I think you are.

494
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:45,890
这是新弄来的
It's fairly recent.

495
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,810
抱歉  肯定很不好受
Sorry. That can't be easy.

496
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,040
我们来不是为了讨论这个
That's not what ?we came here to discuss.

497
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,350
你采取的方式完全错了
You're going about this all wrong.

498
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,130
惊动公众  不明智
Panicking the public... not wise.

499
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,210
你再这么下去  情况会直转急下
Keep doing that, things are gonna get ugly real fast.

500
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:05,690
拉住他
Back him off!

501
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:16,260
他完了
He's done!

502
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,300
胜者产生
We got a winner!

503
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,780
没错
That's right!

504
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,540
好了  他完了  把他拖出去
All right, he's done, get him out of here!

505
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,510
下一个上  快点
Next man up, let's go, come on!

506
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,260
他还有气吗
Is he breathing?

507
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,370
那儿呢
There.

508
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,480
你没事吧
Are you good?

509
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,160
必须厉害的不是我
I'm not the one who needs to be good.

510
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:56,550
瑞奇来了  我们可以开始了
Richy's here. We can get started.

511
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,690
那个倒霉蛋是谁
Who's the unlucky sod, then?

512
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:09,580
你干什么
What the hell are you doing?

513
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,590
永远闭上你这张臭嘴
Shutting your stupid face up once and for all.

514
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,340
好了  就位
All right. In position.

515
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,800
你是开玩笑吗
Are you having a laugh?

516
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:26,930
我以为我们是朋友
I thought we were mates.

517
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,310
你想错了  你个傻蛋
You thought wrong, you mug.

518
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,500
好了
All right.

519
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,700
我们开始前需要了解什么规则吗
Oh, is there any rules I should know about before we start?

520
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,730
没有
Nope.

521
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:40,770
我们不就是开玩笑呢吗
We was having a laugh.

522
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:41,650
我可没笑
I wasn't laughing.

523
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:43,960
心里也没笑吗
Not even on the inside?

524
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,750
我请你喝杯酒吧
Let me get you a drink.

525
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,370
我不渴
I'm not thirsty.

526
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,550
再来一次  喝杯酒啊
Let's try that again. A drink?

527
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,360
还是不用
And again, no.

528
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,440
走吧
Come on.

529
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,350
肯定让你开心的
I promise you'll have a good time.

530
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,300
来吧
Come on.

531
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,190
谁先来
So... Who's first?

532
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,040
不如我帮你个忙  不告诉别人
How about I do you a favor and not tell anyone

533
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,150
你被一个矮小的亚洲女人痛扁了一顿
that a tiny, little asian woman kicked your ass?

534
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:15,770
你还不累吗
Are you not tired yet?

535
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,710
我本是想搞疲劳战术的
Because that was sort of my strategy.

536
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:31,650
来啊
Come on.

537
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,390
宣布胜负啊
Is somebody gonna call it?

538
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,050
有什么必要  他都没气了
What's the point? He's not breathing.

539
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:13,600
我们机构之所以存在就因为你们倒闭了
You know, my agency exists because yours imploded.

540
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,180
但我们回来了
But we came back,

541
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:18,170
虽然地盘小多了  也低调多了
albeit with less real estate and a lower profile.

542
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,680
低调就是问题所在
The low profile's the problem.

543
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:23,220
没人知道你们还在  但怪事却还在发生
No one knows you exist, but bizarre events keep happening.

544
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,640
人民需要有安全感
And people need to feel safe.

545
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:27,160
那么大张旗鼓地宣扬外星威胁
So all these APBs on alien threats...

546
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,760
是为了给人民安全感吗
those are ?to help people feel safe?

547
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,610
事实就是
Look, the truth is,

548
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,100
你根本不了解你对付的是什么
you don't understand what you're dealing with.

549
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,280
你就知道
And you do?

550
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,330
所以我求你让我的队伍把林肯带走
Which is why I'm asking you to let my team bring Lincoln in.

551
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,370
如果我们带走他  会容易点
If we take him, it'll be easy.

552
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,500
而你们去  会导致人受伤的
If you do it, people could get hurt.

553
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,440
或许如此  但是
That might be the case, but...

554
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,110
抱歉
I'm sorry.

555
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,500
我不能同意
I can't agree to that.

556
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,970
安全
Coast is clear.

557
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,280
是我
It's me.

558
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,740
你今天过得真够呛
You're having a hell of a day.

559
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,350
我
I, um...

560
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,990
我杀了他
I killed him.

561
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,970
约翰  他不止一次救过我
John, um, he saved my life more than once.

562
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:31,780
现在  我却救不了他
And now I couldn't bring him back.

563
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,010
他们说的关于我的一切都是对的
Everything they're saying about me is true.

564
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,800
他非常危险
He's extremely dangerous.

565
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,160
如果我们扣押他就不会有威胁了
He won't be if he's in our custody.

566
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,740
我们又不会采集他的器官
We're not gonna harvest him for parts,

567
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,840
如果你是担心这个
if that's ?what you're worried about.

568
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,640
我们不是九头蛇
We're not Hydra.

569
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,710
你现在这么说
You say that now.

570
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,780
他为什么那么重要
What's so important about him?

571
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,920
真的假的
Are you serious?

572
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,470
他能端掉一架飞机
He can bring down a plane.

573
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,330
值得找他聊一聊吧
Feels like a man worth talking to.

574
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,630
我有另一个想法
I have another theory.

575
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,310
总统大谈特谈了
The president makes a big speech

576
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:55,750
他组建的新机构
about this new organization he's put in place.

577
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,160
我猜这给了你不少压力吧
I imagine that puts ?a lot of pressure on you...

578
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,340
必须拿出成绩来
Pressure to show results.

579
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,460
没错
You're not wrong.

580
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,510
所以我要带走他
And that's why I'm taking him in.

581
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,530
但我们为什么来这儿  菲尔
But why are we here, Phil?

582
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,360
等着一起看日落吗
Are we waiting ?to watch the sunset together?

583
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,840
你如果不是来做交易的
'cause if you didn't come here to make a deal,

584
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,940
那你想要什么
then what do you want?

585
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:16,550
你手里有张王牌
You have an ace up your sleeve,

586
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,110
我不想再等你出手了
and I'm tired of waiting for you to play it.

587
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,290
是吗
Is that so?

588
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,760
你有医院的监控录像
You have surveillance from the hospital,

589
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,420
那么你就还有一张
which means there's another picture

590
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,290
没公布出去的照片
you chose not to put on TV.

591
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,160
一个漂亮姑娘
A pretty face...

592
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:37,180
查不到名字  出生记录
...with no name, no birth record,

593
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,120
任何社会联系
no social attached to it.

594
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:41,800
她是他们中的一员
She's one of them.

595
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,570
而且她为你工作  是吧
And she works for you, right?

596
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,860
你要怎样才肯不透露出去
What do I need to do to keep this quiet?

597
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,820
你知道我想要什么
You know what I want.

598
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,760
好吧  他们说得对  你很危险
Fine, they're right... you're dangerous.

599
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,990
我也危险  但那不代表你的为人
I'm dangerous. But that's not who you are. You...

600
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,040
你错了
You're wrong.

601
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,760
-我了解真正的林肯  -你不了解
- I know the real you, Lincoln, and you... - You don't.

602
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,460
我杀了我唯一的朋友
The man ?who killed his only friend,

603
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:09,120
一次次选择堕落
Who had to be saved from himself over and over?

604
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:10,900
这才是真正的我
That's the real me.

605
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,710
真实的我
That's who I really am.

606
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,060
我遇见你时你不是
Not when I met you.

607
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:19,580
你给了我希望  在这世上的一席栖身之地
You gave me hope, a place in the world.

608
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,530
看看结果如何
Look what happened to it.

609
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,800
你比谁都更了解
You know better than anyone,

610
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,340
如果你身边的一切都毁了  那问题就在你
if... if everything around you crumbles, then you're the cause.

611
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,540
够了
Stop!

612
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,330
你看不清  但我看的明白
You don't see it, but I do.

613
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:33,970
你帮助他人  因为那是你的使命
You... you help people because you were meant to.

614
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,090
你跟我们走就能帮助他人
You can do that with us,

615
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,030
就像你之前在医院那样  拯救生命
like you were doing at the hospital... saving lives.

616
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,450
那样的生活已经结束了
That part of my life is over.

617
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:45,680
不  你没有被诅咒
No, you... you are not cursed.

618
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:49,800
你不是什么可怕的东西
You are not some horrible thing.

619
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,930
我确定
I know...

620
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,210
因为你当初就是这么跟我说的
Because you taught me that I wasn't.

621
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:00,060
你让我相信我有使命
You convinced me that I had a purpose,

622
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,540
让我相信我的人生没有结束
that maybe my life wasn't over,

623
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:06,170
而只是有了新方向
but just... getting somewhere.

624
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,090
让我也给你这样的希望吧
Please let me do the same for you.

625
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,840
你担心我就是浪费时间
You're wasting your time caring about me.

626
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,990
我没法不担心
I can't help it.

627
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:35,910
我可以跟你走
I'll go in with you.

628
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:39,250
但我不会跟神盾局合作  我是跟你合作
I'm not agreeing to work with S.H.I.E.L.D., but with you.

629
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,500
我们会一起解决的
We'll figure it out together.

630
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,990
太好了  撤离准备好了吗
Great. Is the, um, escape module on its way?

631
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,690
计划有变
Change of plans.

632
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,510
科尔森的命令
Coulson's orders.

633
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:05,470
我们要把他交给ATCU
We're turning him over to the ATCU.

634
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,470
给科尔森打电话
Get Coulson on the phone.

635
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,140
他说回总部他会跟你解释
He said he'd explain back at headquarters.

636
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,280
黛西  怎么回事
Daisy, what's happening?

637
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,180
科尔森让我告诉你  他不会有事
But Coulson told me to let you know that you're gonna be safe.

638
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,570
他已经安排我们在旁观察确保...
He's arranged for us to observe and make sure...

639
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:20,400
我们能不能赶紧的
Can we get on with this?

640
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,280
这太过分了
This is crazy!

641
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,080
他说他没有选择
He said ?he didn't have a choice.

642
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,400
拿下他
Take him into custody.

643
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,810
疑犯逃跑了  封锁街道
Suspect's on the move. Seal off the street.

644
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,300
等待命令
Awaiting orders.

645
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,050
-我们去追他吗  -不
- Should we go after him? ?- No.

646
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:42,420
抓手到擒来的  拿下她
Bird in the hand. We take her.

647
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,990
你们想干什么
What the hell do you think you're doing?

648
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,150
遵从命令
Following orders.

649
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,480
你真以为你能拦得住我吗
Do you really think you can stop me?

650
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,230
你知道我能做什么吗
Do you have any idea what I can do?

651
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,270
嗯
Yeah.

652
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,280
所以我们在外面安排了三个狙击手待命
That's why I have three snipers outside, ready to engage.

653
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,680
你的异能范围有多远
What's the range on these powers of yours?

654
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,840
有多厉害
How good are they?

655
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,890
其实  还真挺厉害
Actually, pretty damn good.

656
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,630
把你的人叫回来
Tell your men to stand down.

657
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,490
不行
I can't do that.

658
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,080
他逃了  而我已经打了包票
He got away, ?and I've made assurances.

659
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,650
我向你保证  你如果非要抓我的特工
I assure you that if you insist on taking my agent in,

660
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:09,920
只会引发战争
you will start a war.

661
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,200
我会动用神盾局的全部资源和人力
I will devote all the resources and manpower of S.H.I.E.L.D.

662
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,450
摧毁你们机构
to crushing your agency.

663
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:15,170
不是针对你  只是工作
It's not personal. It's work.

664
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:17,050
我现在必须拿出成绩来
And right now I need to show results.

665
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:18,970
如果我给你更好的呢
What if Ii offer something better?

666
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,740
收到
Copy that.

667
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,910
看来今天算你走运
I guess it's your lucky day.

668
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,910
任务结束
We're done.

669
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:31,430
我们走
Let's go.

670
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,580
我觉得带你来个高档安静的地方
I thought it'd be good for you to get out somewhere nice...

671
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,270
会比较不错
and quiet.

672
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,220
人都哪去了
Where is everyone?

673
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,580
我确保了不会有人分你的心
Well, I made sure you wouldn't have any distractions.

674
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,720
菲兹先生  见到你很高兴
Mr. Fitz, ?we're delighted to see you.

675
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:56,210
你们的桌子就在这边
Your table is this way.

676
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,560
酒是赠送的
The wine is a gift from us.

677
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,030
这位年轻人真是有耐心
A very persistent young man here.

678
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:12,420
我们已经为他保留了几个月的预定了
We've been holding ?this reservation for months.

679
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:14,050
很高兴你们终于来了
I'm delighted you're finally here.

680
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,350
你一直留着预定
You kept the reservation.

681
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,890
别大惊小怪啦  没什么的
Don't make a fuss. It's not a big deal.

682
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,080
我记得我住院数月后你带我出去吃饭
I remember when you took me out after months in the hospital.

683
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,610
让我觉得又像个人了
It made me feel like a human being again.

684
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,090
那次你一直抱怨个不停
You complained the entire time.

685
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,190
好吧
Well...

686
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:34,040
坏脾气的人
Okay, a crabby human being.

687
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:39,600
真太感谢你了
I can't thank you enough.

688
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:42,470
嗯  这餐厅不错  是吧
Yeah. It's a nice restaurant, isn't it?

689
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:45,580
是啊  但不止如此
Yeah, ?but for more than that...

690
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,150
还有谢谢你找到我
for finding me.

691
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,000
我还能怎么办
What else was I gonna do?

692
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,110
我不知道该说什么好
I don't know what to say.

693
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:57,480
你什么都不用说
You don't have to say anything.

694
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,960
决定好要点什么了吗
Have you decided what you'll be having?

695
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,910
天呐  好多...
Oh, gosh. So much...

696
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,670
选择
to choose from...

697
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,590
或许这能帮你拿主意
Maybe this will help.

698
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,360
我敬杯酒吧
Should I make a toast?

699
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,680
怎么了
What?

700
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,220
能给我们点时间吗
Can you give us two minutes?

701
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,360
当然
Of course.

702
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,190
给我解释一下
Help me understand.

703
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,300
那个决定并不容易
It was not an easy decision.

704
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:55,900
把林肯交出去
To hand Lincoln over?

705
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,430
我必须做出选择
I had to make a choice.

706
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:00,520
不是我就是他
So it was him or me.

707
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,080
他们有你的照片  黛西
They have your picture, Daisy.

708
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:03,730
那他们怎么没抓走我
So why didn't they take me?

709
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:06,480
林肯一逃  你是怎么说服他们不抓我的
Once Lincoln left, how did you convince them not to take me in?

710
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:09,090
我给了他们一样有价值的东西
I offered them something just as valuable.

711
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:11,740
-什么  -我  我的专业知识
- What? - ?Me. My expertise.

712
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,590
怎么  我们还要跟他们合作了吗
So... so now we're working with them?

713
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,760
我不想再跟人
I'm done fighting with people

714
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,740
争谁来打击真正的敌人了
over who gets to fight the real fight.

715
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:20,360
这太浪费时间和资源了
It's a colossal waste of time and resources.

716
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:21,410
我对付过塔伯特
I went against Talbot.

717
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:23,440
我对付过神盾局的另一个派系
I went against another faction of S.H.I.E.L.D.

718
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,590
我们了解情况  他们不了解
We know what we're doing... they don't.

719
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:27,270
希望他们能跟我们学学
Hopefully, they can learn from us.

720
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:31,190
他们抓捕我的族类  我很难信任他们
It is hard to trust them when they are hunting people like me.

721
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,430
我没说我信任他们
I never said I trust them.

722
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,090
很好
Good.

723
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:35,460
别信任他们  我们并不知道他们的真正目的
Don't, because we have no idea what they're really after.

724
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,360
了解了  听我说
Duly noted. Look...

725
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,650
我知道这事触及了你的感情
...I understand this is a personal matter for you.

726
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,780
麦克把他听到的话告诉你了
So Mack told you what he heard me say?

727
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,510
什么话
And what would that be?

728
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,240
是罗莎琳
?It's Rosalind.

729
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,040
都直呼其名了啊
First-name basis, huh?

730
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,390
不打扰了
I'll leave you to it.

731
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:05,660
没想到你这么快就打过来了
Well, I'm surprised to hear from you so soon.

732
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,760
就是确认一下
Just checking,

733
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,690
看你是不是给了我假号码
making sure you didn't give me a fake number.

734
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:22,510
没事吧
You all right?

735
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,360
不怎么样
I've been better.

736
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,820
谢谢你没说出去
Thanks for not saying anything.

737
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,280
知道吗
You know what?

738
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,810
我需要点支援呢
I sure could use some backup.

739
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,640
看看你本事怎么样  丫头
Let's see what kind of skills you got, kid.

740
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:45,640
好吧
All right.

741
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,500
要见你可真不容易
Well, you certainly don't make it easy to get a meeting.

742
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,520
老大的要求
The boss doesn't want it to be easy.

743
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,630
但他总是愿意见
But he's always interested in meeting people

744
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,280
能证明自己的人
who can prove themselves.

745
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,300
他听上去挺有意思
Sounds like an interesting bloke.

746
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:15,340
很期待哪天见见他
I look forward to meeting him someday.

747
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,530
西蒙斯
Simmons?

748
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:02,690
你研究那个干什么
Why are you looking at that?

749
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:04,980
我想理解
Trying to understand.

750
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,750
这没什么值得研究的
There's nothing to learn from this.

751
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,300
它并没失效
It's possible it's not inert.

752
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,760
外星金属的特性很不一样
Alien metals ?have different properties.

753
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,680
我们无法确定
We don't know for sure.

754
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:12,840
我们能确定
Yes, we do.

755
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,570
你安全了
You're safe.

756
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:16,620
那个传送门不会再开启了
That portal won't open again.

757
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,970
但它必须开启
But it has to.

758
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,010
我得回去
I have to go back.

759
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:48,890
