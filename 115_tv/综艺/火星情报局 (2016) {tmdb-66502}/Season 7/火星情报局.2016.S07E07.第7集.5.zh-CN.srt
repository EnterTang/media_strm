00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,560
漫威《神盾局特工》前情回顾
Previously on "Marvel's Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D."...

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,400
你为什么想重建传送门  珍玛
Why do you want to rebuild the portal, Jemma?

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,090
因为我必须回去
Because I have to get back there.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,860
我做过几十次模拟了
I've run dozens of simulations.

5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,430
但巨石只是一种选择
The monolith was just one option, though.

6
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,880
我们不会放弃的  好吗
We're not gonna give up, okay?

7
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,280
那是什么  冻结胶质吗
What is it? Some kind of suspension gel?

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,280
可以让他们处于静止态  健康鲜活  但沉睡着
It keeps them in stasis... alive, healthy, just asleep.

9
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:19,310
斯特拉克
Strucker.

10
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,350
沃德在哪
Where do I find Ward?

11
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,060
我想完成沃德吩咐的任务
I tried to do what Ward wanted.

12
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,390
我想杀了他
I tried to kill him.

13
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,520
加纳教授吗
Professor Garner.

14
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:44,100
毛伊岛威雷亚海滩6个月前

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,490
你刚刚为了捕捉一个美好的瞬间反而毁了气氛
Did you just spoil a perfect moment by capturing it?

16
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,400
你在这个阳光下太美了
You looked too good, sun hitting you like that.

17
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,150
明天这时候我们就到家了
Well, this time tomorrow, we'll be home.

18
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,540
现在是谁在破坏气氛了
Look who's spoiling the moment now.

19
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:13,900
我要是不回神盾局你觉得怎么样
What would you say if I didn't go back to S.H.I.E.L.D.?

20
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:18,950
你是认真的吗
You're serious.

21
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,390
至少不马上回去
At least, not right away.

22
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,570
你这么说是因为身在海岛吗  还是
So, is this the island talking, or are you... I mean...

23
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,630
有很多原因会导致我们走不下去
There are a lot of reasons why this won't work...

24
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,320
无法维系
why we won't work.

25
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,450
有时我会忘记你多么直接
Sometimes I forgot how direct you are.

26
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,630
我不想成为原因之一
I don't want to be one of those reasons.

27
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:33,510
你不会的
And you won't be.

28
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,130
听着  我们成长了  也更加明智了
Listen, we're older now and wiser.

29
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,600
我不想第二次失去你
And I don't plan on losing you a second time.

30
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,870
怎么样
So what do you say?

31
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,360
想稳定下来吗
You want to go steady?

32
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,140
我们刚才是在讨论我们变老了吗
Weren't we just talking about how we're older?

33
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,250
是啊
Yes.

34
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,150
那好吧
All right, then.

35
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,340
敬新开始
To new beginnings.

36
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,890
敬新开始
To new beginnings.

37
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,240
我不知道梅琳达什么时候能回去  菲尔
I don't know when Melinda's coming back, Phil.

38
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,900
我们几天前才回到家
We only got home a couple of days ago.

39
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,950
我想谢谢你把嘉颖来世的东西送来
Wanted to thank you for sending over Jiaying's things from afterlife.

40
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,930
希望这些东西能对现在的异人族状况有所帮助
Hopefully, it'll help shed some light on our new Inhuman situation.

41
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,470
如果有什么发现我会告诉你的
I'll keep you posted if I find anything interesting.

42
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,450
还有  菲尔  别等梅琳达打给你了
And, Phil, I wouldn't wait for Melinda to call you.

43
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,350
好建议  谢谢
Good advice. Thanks.

44
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,780
好了
All right.

45
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,910
天哪
Oh, god.

46
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,590
我们不是怪物
We're not monsters.

47
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,480
你不能因为不知道该怎么做
You can't just lock us up in some ice prison

48
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,970
就把我们关在冰冻监狱里
because you don't know what else to do.

49
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,500
那不是什么监狱
No one's talking prison.

50
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,910
理论上来讲  那是个凝胶块
And, technically, it's a gel matrix.

51
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,740
他们把人置于静止态
They're putting people in stasis.

52
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,760
你可以把那理解为药物诱导性昏迷
Think of it as a medically induced coma,

53
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,040
在我们找到更好的解决办法前按下暂停键
a way to hit the pause button until we find a better solution.

54
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,020
更好的解决办法  那是什么意思
"A better solution." What does that mean?

55
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,400
ATCU正在寻找治愈方法
The ATCU's looking for a cure.

56
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,740
我并不是说所有人都得用
I'm not suggesting that's for everyone,

57
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,000
因为不是的  但也许有人会想...
because it's not, but some people might want to...

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,210
我们又不是病
We are not a disease.

59
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,500
我没那个意思
I didn't say that you were.

60
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,060
你不能指望人们
You can't just expect people

61
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,410
经历那样的巨变
to go through that kind of change

62
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,140
然后马上就能控制好
and immediately have a handle on it.

63
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,390
你还记得我当初有多害怕吗
Do you remember how scared I was at first?

64
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,240
记得  我还记得你冲自己开了冰冻枪
Yes. I also remember you iced yourself

65
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,910
以防伤害到我们
so that you wouldn't hurt any of us.

66
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,770
-你得承认事情有点失控了  -我知道
- You've got to admit, things are getting out of hand. - I know.

67
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,600
有人在不受控的环境中发生转化
People are changing in uncontrolled environments...

68
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,680
我知道  但人人都该有个做自己的机会
I know, but everyone deserves a chance to be who they are.

69
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,910
这你就错了
That's where you're wrong.

70
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,950
你是被你自己的经历误导了
You're being seduced by your own experience.

71
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,360
你学会了如何控制自己的异能
Just because you learned how to control your powers

72
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,870
不代表其他人也都能学会
doesn't mean everyone else will.

73
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,090
万一有人在伤害自己
I mean, what if a person's hurting themselves

74
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,580
或他们身边的人呢
or those around them?

75
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,670
要是他们无法自制怎么办
What... what if they can't stop?

76
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,580
就拿鞭笞来说吧
Take Lash.

77
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,180
要是朝那怪物头上打一枪还不能阻止他
If putting a bullet in that monster's head doesn't do the trick,

78
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,300
那怎么办
then what?

79
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,070
这可不公平  他只是个例
That's not fair. That's one guy.

80
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,830
大部分异人的转化会介于我和他之间
Most inhumans fall somewhere between me and him.

81
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,840
我今天要见总统和他的顾问们
And that's the message I'm hoping the president

82
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,390
希望到时候他们能听进去这话
and his advisors will hear when I meet with them today.

83
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,050
你要见美国总统
The president of the United States?

84
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:04,860
是个密会
It's off the books,

85
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,540
但国际社会要齐聚一堂
but the global community's coming together

86
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,730
讨论这些能力增强者的未来
to discuss the future of enhanced people.

87
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,730
会面地点在科罗拉多州的北美防空联合司令部
We're meeting at NORAD in colorado.

88
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,610
但神盾局对外是不存在的
But S.H.I.E.L.D. isn't supposed to exist.

89
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,200
所以我的身份会是ATCU的顾问
That's why I'm going in as a consultant for the ATCU.

90
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,620
-所以是罗莎琳・普莱斯  -安排的  对
- So Rosalind Price... - Arranged it, yes.

91
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,220
我们坐和风一号过去  路上接她
We're taking Zephyr One, picking her up on the way.

92
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,330
你确定这是个好主意吗
Are you sure this is a good idea?

93
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,810
我们不能失去这样的机会
We can't afford to miss it.

94
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,890
所以我希望你能在会面前跟罗莎琳谈谈
That's why I want you to talk to Rosalind before the meeting.

95
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,570
让她站在你这边
Win her over to your side of things.

96
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:31,020
可能是让神盾局重见天日的好开端
Could be a real start toward legitimizing S.H.I.E.L.D.

97
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,100
但如果你能拿出一个成功的异人案例
But it might help if you can present a successful

98
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,380
可能会有帮助
inhuman case,

99
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,500
一个在双方看来都不极端的案例
one that's not an extreme on either side.

100
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,480
乔伊・古铁雷斯该做重新评估了
Joey Gutierrez is due for reassessment.

101
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,050
我很愿意去看看他进展如何了
I'd be more than happy to check in on him, see how he's progressing.

102
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,220
总没坏处
Couldn't hurt.

103
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:42,950
我同意
I agree.

104
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,940
我会在你们降落前把报告发去
I can send you my report while you're in the air.

105
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,470
谢谢你的帮助
Thank you for your help on this.

106
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,110
我就是来帮忙的
It's what I'm here for.

107
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,060
不
No.

108
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,910
我是不明白你为什么给我打电话
I just don't know why you're calling me.

109
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,800
好吧  把位置发给我
All right. Give me your location.

110
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,950
我去找你
I'll meet you there.

111
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,980
加纳博士
Dr. Garner.

112
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,080
你好像要去实验室
Looks like you're heading to the lab.

113
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,300
这是个好迹象  对吗
That's a good sign, right?

114
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,440
我在努力
I'm trying.

115
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,680
我们都在努力
We're trying.

116
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,740
有时候我觉得  或许不该把一切
Sometimes it just feels like it would've been best

117
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,630
都告诉菲兹
if I hadn't told Fitz everything.

118
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,800
你说出真相是对的  珍玛
You did the right thing in telling the truth, Jemma.

119
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,490
秘密会从内心吞噬你
Secrets can eat you up from the inside.

120
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,040
你在忙吗
You busy?

121
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,310
不  不
Uh, no. No.

122
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,070
抱歉  我最近都不怎么常来
Sorry I haven't been in here more.

123
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,810
你不必解释的
There's... there's no need to explain.

124
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,860
那是什么
What's that?

125
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,290
是我的手机
It's my phone.

126
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,600
我当时正好带着
I had it with me.

127
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,710
我拍了照片  录了音
Uh, I took pictures, made some recordings

128
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:53,990
来记录我在那里的生活
to document my time there.

129
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,870
损毁很严重  但我还是留着作为纪念
It's quite damaged, but I kept it on me as a remembrance.

130
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,070
我希望你能
I was hoping you could...

131
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,130
恢复数据
Recover the data.

132
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:00,850
也许没什么用
It's probably pointless.

133
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,550
不  也许有用
Yeah, no. Maybe not.

134
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,910
我觉得你该自己...
Just thought if you saw it for...

135
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,050
看看  嗯
Myself, yeah.

136
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,360
总是很高兴有你做我的第二双眼睛
I always felt better having you as my second pair of eyes.

137
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,760
试试又无妨  我这就开始
Well, couldn't hurt to try. I'll get right on it.

138
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,180
谢谢  菲兹
Thank you, Fitz.

139
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,690
但我不知道他会变身
But I didn't know he'd change into that thing.

140
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,840
你在担心安德鲁吗
You worried about Andrew?

141
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,680
还是郁闷那个斯特拉克小子还没来得及交代
Or pissed that the Strucker kid went comatose

142
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,830
就陷入昏迷了
before he could talk?

143
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,010
总部的人都说安德鲁没事
Well...everyone at HQ says that Andrew's fine.

144
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,260
至于九头蛇...
And as far as Hydra...

145
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,580
我们会抓到他们的
we'll get them.

146
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,780
我希望你能留下
I hope you stick around.

147
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,140
我们如今要对付的可不只是九头蛇
Hydra's not the only thing we're facing these days.

148
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,520
异人族状况  还有我们在找的那个怪物
Between the inhumans, this monster we're hunting,

149
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,430
ATCU又盯我们盯得紧紧的
And the ATCU on our ass,

150
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,450
我们需要一切帮手
We need all the help that we can get.

151
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,130
怪物
Monster?

152
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,380
是啊  那个喜欢杀死其他异人的大丑怪物
Yeah. Big ugly thing, likes to kill other inhumans.

153
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,730
你们一直在追踪他吗
You've been tracking him?

154
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,790
试图追踪
Trying.

155
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,500
他能变身成普通人类  简直没法找
Transforms into a man, which makes him impossible to find.

156
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,170
飞行记录

157
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:29,550
飞行记录

158
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:29,970
飞行记录

159
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:30,760
飞行记录

160
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,550
安德鲁・加纳  飞行日志

161
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:29,920
安德鲁・加纳  飞行日志

162
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,760
安德鲁・加纳  飞行日志

163
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:43,400
安德鲁・加纳

164
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,020
安德鲁・加纳

165
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,350
梅
May.

166
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,790
天啊  见到你真高兴
Oh, my God. It's good to see you.

167
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,790
我得走了
I-I got to go.

168
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,080
去哪
Go where?

169
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,020
我得和安德鲁谈谈
I, uh, need to talk to Andrew.

170
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,410
他在给一个新异人做心理评估
He's doing a psych eval on one of the new inhuman recruits.

171
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,760
我去隔离舱看过  他不在
I checked the containment room. He's not...

172
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,450
不  他去了基地外的一个训练场
No, he's at a training facility off-site.

173
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,540
在哪
Where?

174
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,170
神盾局训练场  代号  茧

175
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,980
我现在可以创造东西了
I can actually create things now.

176
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,630
你对此是什么感觉
And how does that make you feel?

177
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,870
挺高兴的
Excited, you know?

178
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:41,450
我现在控制力强多了
I have so much more control now.

179
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,370
加纳博士
Dr. Garner?

180
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,880
控制  是的
Control. Yes.

181
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,960
这很重要
That's important.

182
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:02,450
黛西觉得我能成为神盾局的资源
Daisy thinks I could be a real asset to S.H.I.E.L.D.

183
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,080
但她说我的命运掌控在你手里
But she said my fate is in your hands.

184
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,720
是的  乔伊
Yes, Joey.

185
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,200
确实是
It is.

186
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,750
你不用为我穿上衣服
Don't put your shirt on for my benefit.

187
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,440
听说了你跟九头蛇的泳池派对
Heard about your Hydra pool party.

188
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,360
我还担心你呢
And here I was worried about you.

189
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,280
我一直就不怎么喜欢开博
Never liked Kebo much myself.

190
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,820
名字太怪了
Funny name.

191
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,380
还把我关在后备箱里
Locked me in a trunk.

192
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,760
你没事吧
You all right?

193
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,390
-当然  -那就好
- Of course. - Good.

194
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,490
除掉沃德的一些核心成员
'Cause taking out some of Ward's key players

195
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,300
-让我们离找到那混蛋更进一步了  -不行
- brings us one step closer to finding the bastard. - No.

196
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,280
科尔森忙着应付黛西  现在是最好的时机
Coulson's busy with Daisy, so now is as good a time as any.

197
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,550
亨特  这
Hunter, it's just...

198
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,260
这不是个好主意
it's not a good idea.

199
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,860
是因为安德鲁吗
Is this about Andrew?

200
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,610
我以为这事已经过去了
'Cause I thought we were past all that...

201
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,660
既然他没事了
Now that he's all right, I mean.

202
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,910
好吧  事态是有点失控
Okay. Did things get slightly out of control? Yes.

203
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,610
但是显然我都能处理好
But nothing I couldn't handle, obviously.

204
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,790
而且我做的一切都是为了保护你
And everything I did was to protect you.

205
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,850
芭比  你能停一会儿吗
Bob, will you stop for one second?

206
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,930
我觉得我们俩都不该去抓沃德
I don't want either of us to go after Ward.

207
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,200
你在开玩笑  对吧
You... you're joking, right?

208
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,170
你什么时候决定的
Since when?

209
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,540
不管是什么  直说吧
Whatever it is, lay it on me.

210
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,390
我觉得你最近鲁莽又愚蠢
I think you've been reckless and stupid.

211
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,630
我能收回我刚刚说的话吗
Can I take back what I just said?

212
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,730
为了什么
And for what?

213
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,010
这样沃德就再不能伤害你了
So Ward won't lay a bloody finger on you again!

214
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,120
这就是为什么
That's what.

215
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,040
对  我很蠢  因为我爱你
Yeah, I'm stupid, because I love you!

216
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,020
我不需要一个拯救我的英勇骑士  亨特
I don't need a knight in shining armor, Hunter.

217
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,640
我需要你活着
I need you alive.

218
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,910
我不想失去你
I don't want to lose you.

219
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,010
好吧  你说得对
Okay. You're right.

220
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,240
也不想我们俩都迷失其中
Or lose ourselves.

221
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,050
因为太执着于复仇
Become so obsessed with revenge

222
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:59,450
自己也变成他那样的魔鬼
that we... we turn into monsters just like him.

223
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,970
我还从没登上过空中基地呢
Never walked onto a flying base before.

224
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,200
看来可以把这个从我的遗愿清单里划掉了
Guess I can cross that off my bucket list.

225
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,330
那么  从哪里开始参观
So, where does the tour begin?

226
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,970
这要看黛西了  她带你参观
That's actually up to Daisy. She's gonna show you around.

227
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,530
生日快乐  珍玛
Happy birthday, Jemma!

228
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,430
生日快乐  珍玛
Happy birthday, Jemma.

229
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,590
没有你在不一样
It's not the same without you here.

230
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,740
替我跟你父母问好  我们回头见
Say hi to your parents for me, and I'll see you soon.

231
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,750
两个卫星  我的天哪
Two moons. Bloody hell.

232
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,310
菲兹
Fitz...

233
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:37,880
我有可能在其中一个极地  但是很奇怪
It's possible I'm on one of the poles, but it's strange.

234
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,440
星星和两个卫星
The stars and the two moons,

235
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,640
不断地消失  又再出现
they keep disappearing and reappearing.

236
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,570
但没有太阳
But there's no sun.

237
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,180
就是没有太阳
There's never a sun.

238
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,960
上次你见到我时  我一团糟
Last time you saw me, I was a wreck.

239
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,180
现在我觉得很有力量
Now I feel... empowered.

240
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,260
听起来可能很蠢
That probably sounds stupid.

241
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,220
听起来你开始接受这是你的一部分
Sounds like you've grown to accept that this is a part of you.

242
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,430
说实话  作为建筑工人
Honestly, as a construction guy,

243
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,100
通常要花几个月建好的工程
the idea that I could build in a day

244
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,670
我一天之内就能搞定
something that would normally take months...

245
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,890
这简直不真实
it's unreal.

246
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,420
或是拆毁什么
Or tear something down.

247
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,290
如果有必要的话
Yeah. If I have to.

248
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,590
就这么轻松
Just like that.

249
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,080
黛西想要组建一支队伍  是吗
Daisy's trying to put together a team of soldiers, right?

250
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,400
-进行对抗  -对抗邪恶
- To fight. - To fight evil.

251
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,310
我可以成为很好的武器
I could be a real weapon against it.

252
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,550
危险的武器
A dangerous weapon.

253
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,640
这就是我担心的事
That's what I'm worried about.

254
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,630
我们以为没人...
We weren't expecting anyone to...

255
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,130
梅琳达  怎么了
Melinda, what's going on?

256
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,330
把古铁雷斯先生带回基地
Take Mr. Gutierrez back to base.

257
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,820
-我们正在会诊  -加纳博士
- We're in the middle of a session. - Dr. Garner...

258
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,840
会诊结束  带他走
Not anymore. Do it now.

259
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,340
长官  我们有规定的
Ma'am, we have protocols.

260
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,170
那就按规矩走  然后带他离开
Take care of them, then go.

261
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,560
走吧
Come on.

262
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:51,820
这是怎么回事
What's all this about?

263
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,020
我们得谈谈
We need to talk...

264
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,930
单独谈谈
once we're alone.

265
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,900
谢谢你来
Thanks for coming.

266
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,180
不必紧张
You can settle down.

267
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,490
没人知道我们在这里
No one knows we're here.

268
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,520
你睡过觉吗
You getting any sleep?

269
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,860
一直被人追杀  很难有机会睡
It's kind of hard when I'm being hunted nonstop.

270
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,140
我其实只担心
I'm really only worried

271
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,910
那个想把我胸口炸穿的人
about the one who wants to blast a hole through my chest.

272
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,120
如果你有那人的情报  为什么不找黛西
If you've got intel on the guy, why not call Daisy?

273
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,110
因为我不能让她也陷入危险
'Cause I can't put her life at risk, too.

274
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,230
我去找了我的朋友
I went looking for my friends.

275
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,360
他们不是失踪了就是死了
And those who aren't missing are dead.

276
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,940
为什么跟我说这些
You're telling me this why?

277
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,370
因为你曾跟我一起对付那东西
Because you fought by my side against that thing.

278
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,590
所以你就排除了嫌疑
It eliminates you as a suspect.

279
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,670
我怎么可能有嫌疑
Why would I be a suspect?

280
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,950
因为你是神盾局的
Cause you're with S.H.I.E.L.D.

281
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,040
好吧  我...不太理解
Okay. I... I'm not sure I'm following.

282
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,970
鞭笞就在神盾局里
Lash is in S.H.I.E.L.D.

283
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,050
如果你肯帮我  我就能证明
And with your help, I can prove it.

284
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,650
谢谢你带我参观
I appreciate you showing me around like this.

285
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,640
我们建了这个隔离舱  帮助转化中的异人
We built this module to help those in transition.

286
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,190
这是由适应性材料建成的
It's made out of adaptive material,

287
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,650
能控制各种异能
so it can contain all sorts of powers.

288
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,710
而且防弹  当你这样的人要朝
It's also bulletproof, which comes in handy

289
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,880
我这样的人开枪时  就派上用场了
when people like you shoot at people like me.

290
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,670
你真觉得这更人道吗
And you really think this is more humane?

291
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,310
我们的目标是观察异人  教化他们
Our goal is to observe people, educate them,

292
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,530
确实  这需要时间  但是...
and, yes, it can take time, but...

293
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,230
我们并不总是有时间的
We don't always have that luxury.

294
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,320
但把异人丢在一边  当他们不存在
But throwing people away like they don't even exist

295
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,030
这样就好吗
is the answer?

296
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,150
-我们没有这样做  -看起来就是这样
- That's not what we're doing. - Sure as hell looks like it.

297
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,510
没那么简单
Well, it's not that simple.

298
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,150
你就承认吧
Just admit it.

299
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,020
你惧怕我这样的人  惧怕我们的能力
You're afraid of people like me, afraid of our power.

300
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,850
当然
Absolutely.

301
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,320
你了解自己的能力吗
Do you even know your own strength?

302
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,780
比方说  你能击落这架飞机吗
Could you take down this plane, for instance?

303
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,630
我不会那样做的
I wouldn't do that.

304
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,130
但如果你想呢
But if you wanted to?

305
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,600
你现在就能杀了我
You could kill me right now.

306
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,910
人类就已经够吓人了
Mankind's scary enough as it is.

307
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,940
哪个疯子有把枪  我们都得小心了
Some psycho gets a gun, and watch out.

308
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,000
但如今  有些人自己就是武器
But now people are their own weapon.

309
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,920
不是每个人都...
Not everyone is like...

310
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,160
"有些"就已经够多了
"Some" is enough. That's all it takes.

311
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,490
-你只看到了糟糕的一面  -不是那样的
- You only see the terrible things. - That's not true.

312
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,440
-我能保护大家  -无所谓
- I protect people. - It doesn't matter.

313
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,340
你怎么能这么说
How can you say that?

314
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:02,060
有一个黛西・约翰逊  就会有一个鞭笞
Because for every Daisy Johnson, there's a Lash,

315
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,490
你不这么想  就是愚蠢
and it's ignorant for you to think otherwise.

316
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,960
梅琳达  你倒是说句话
Melinda, talk to me.

317
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,190
究竟怎么回事
What's all this about?

318
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,750
我需要知道真相
I need to know... for myself...

319
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,130
在其他人卷进来之前
before anyone else gets involved.

320
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:22,980
你想知道什么
Know what?

321
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,550
我看了你的飞行日志  我追查了你的活动
I saw your flight logs. I tracked your movements.

322
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:28,760
至少五个异人被害时  你都在50公里范围内
You were within 30 miles of at least five inhuman deaths.

323
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,070
你为什么要去查我的飞行日志
Why are you looking at my flight logs?

324
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,850
我还查了你的医疗记录
Pulled your medical files, too.

325
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,090
你的血检报告被删除了
Your blood work was deleted.

326
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,150
可能是西蒙斯不小心...
So, maybe Simmons accidentally...

327
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,280
你以为你掩藏了行踪  但是并没有
You thought you covered your tracks, but you didn't.

328
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,260
梅琳达  你到底想说什么
Melinda, honestly, what are you getting at?

329
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,060
冯・斯特拉克那孩子还活着
That Von Strucker kid was alive.

330
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,250
他并没有死于爆炸
He didn't die in that blast.

331
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,610
我找到了他
I tracked him down.

332
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,060
他把你做的事都告诉我了
He told me what you did.

333
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,160
我做的事
What I did.

334
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,530
有个孩子说我...
So some kid says I...

335
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,090
他没有说谎
He wasn't lying.

336
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,910
他脸上的表情
The look on his face...

337
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,130
是纯粹的恐惧
it was pure terror.

338
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,430
你到底怎么了
What happened to you?

339
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:12,270
-你可以告诉我  -梅琳达
- You can tell me. - Melinda...

340
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,030
不要骗我
Don't lie to me.

341
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,430
你不会想知道的
You don't want to know.

342
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,990
-他说你是怪物  -梅琳达  不要
- He said you were a monster. - Melinda, don't...

343
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,000
怎么会这样
How could this even happen?

344
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,240
梅琳达  别问了
Melinda, stop!

345
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,710
安德鲁  拜托
Andrew, please!

346
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,260
-拜托  -闭嘴
- Please! - Stop!

347
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,430
三周过去了  菲兹
It's been three weeks, Fitz.

348
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,020
如果我不找点什么  如果我不吃东西
If I don't find something, if I don't eat,

349
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,420
是活不下去的
I won't make it.

350
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,860
菲兹  你好
Fitz, hi.

351
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,180
我不知道我为什么还在跟你说话
I don't know why I'm still talking with you...

352
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,690
还继续录我自己
why I'm recording myself.

353
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,160
你是永远不会看到了  是吗
You're never gonna see this, are you?

354
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,550
我还是没找到水
I still haven't found water,

355
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,510
而且...我...
and it's, um... well, I...

356
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,750
我...
It's, uh...

357
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,830
我很难集中注意力
I'm having trouble focusing,

358
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:14,020
我努力想保持乐观
and I'm trying to stay positive.

359
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,850
但是我害怕
But I'm scared.

360
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,370
我很害怕  菲兹
I'm scared, Fitz.

361
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,120
你还记得我们第一次见面吗
Do you remember when we first met?

362
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,940
我还记得
I do.

363
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:29,040
你少言寡语  脸色苍白
You were so quiet and pasty, and...

364
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:33,600
那么聪明又帅气
so incredibly smart, handsome...

365
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,330
这感觉很奇怪吧
Quite a strange feeling... isn't it?...

366
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,460
不想跟一个人分开
Never wanting to be without someone.

367
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,600
你一定很烦我总是跟着你
You must have been so annoyed, me following you around all the time.

368
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,950
没有
No.

369
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,710
从来没有
Never.

370
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,420
有时我会想我们的晚餐
I imagine our dinner sometimes...

371
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,210
去哪里  吃什么
Where we'd go, what we'd eat.

372
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,030
其实我经常想我们两人的事
I wonder about us a lot, actually.

373
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,100
在佩思郡有一间小农舍
There's this small cottage in Perthshire

374
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,120
我小时候  和家人度假
We drove by once when I was a girl,

375
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,640
曾开车经过那里
some... some...family holiday,

376
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,050
不知为什么
and I don't know why,

377
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:10,020
我觉得它很可爱
but I... I found it so lovely.

378
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,720
我现在还会想起它
I still think about it...

379
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,100
在那里我们可以一起...
A place where you and I could have...

380
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,090
但也就是想想吧
But that's that, I suppose.

381
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,540
不知道这块电池还能用多久
I'm not sure how long this battery will last.

382
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,110
我该省点电
I should save it, just in case,

383
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,040
以防有更重要的事要做
for more important things.

384
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,040
但如果可以  我还会对你自言自语
But I'll still talk to you on my own, if that's all right.

385
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,420
我会永远与你同在  菲兹
I'll always be with you, Fitz.

386
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:58,550
卡尔弗大学  老行政大楼

387
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,610
太好了  你醒了  对不起
Oh, thank god you're awake. I am so sorry.

388
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:12,180
我没想伤害你  我慌神了
I-I didn't want to hurt you. I... I panicked.

389
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,050
这是在哪
Where are we?

390
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,370
我们不能留在神盾局的机构里
We couldn't stay there, not with S.H.I.E.L.D.

391
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,880
我需要时间解释
I needed time to explain.

392
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,850
之前有多少次我差点就告诉你了
You don't know how many times I almost told you.

393
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,230
只是  我不知道怎么说
I just... I didn't know how.

394
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,690
我也不想这样的
I didn't ask for this.

395
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,390
天呐
Oh, god.

396
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,440
你都做了什么
What have you done?

397
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:36,920
梅琳达  别这样
Melinda, don't.

398
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,780
放  开  我
Let me go!

399
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,600
别这样  我不知道我会做出什么事来
Don't do that! I don't... I don't know what I'll do.

400
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,800
我会再次被本能控制的
Instinct will take over again...

401
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,290
就像在便利店里那样
Like it did at the convenience store.

402
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,690
本能
Instinct?

403
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,300
我没想伤害任何人
I didn't want to hurt anyone,

404
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,810
但我不知道是怎么回事
but I... I didn't know what was happening.

405
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:55,010
你杀了那么多人
You killed all those people.

406
00:20:58,670 --> 00:20:59,770
怎么回事
How?

407
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,050
什么时候发生的
When did this... when did...

408
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,260
离开夏威夷后
After Hawaii.

409
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,940
黛西的妈妈有很多记录
Daisy's mom kept records.

410
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:13,050
我当时在浏览  做研究  了解情况
I was going through them for any insight, for research.

411
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,870
我找到一本书
And I found a book.

412
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:17,080
上面有很多异人的名字
It had all these names of inhumans.

413
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,830
嘉颖一定是布下了泰瑞根水晶
Now, Jiaying must have rigged it with a terrigen crystal

414
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,670
以防不能穿过迷雾的人翻看
to keep out anyone who couldn't survive the mist.

415
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,480
算我走运
Lucky me.

416
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,670
起初  我如释重负  我活下来了
At first, I was relieved. I survived.

417
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,640
但我知道有些不对劲
But I knew something had happened.

418
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:39,420
我觉得恶心
I felt sick and nauseous.

419
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,430
有一种强烈的脉动感
There was this intense pulsing,

420
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,730
好像我的心在脑子里跳动
like my heart was in my head.

421
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,720
我觉得我变了
I felt different, like...

422
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,970
就像我的一部分被释放了
like a part of me was unlocked.

423
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,210
释放
Unlocked?

424
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,800
我不知道还能怎么说
I don't know how else to... I just... I had to...

425
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,960
我就像受了驱使  必须接近他们
It was as if I was compelled. I had to be near them.

426
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:01,590
那些异人
The inhumans.

427
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,870
我不知道为什么  那感觉很强烈
I didn't know why. It was... it was intense.

428
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,780
我有了一种新的欲望  我有种
I had this new desire. I had a...

429
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,240
我皮肤上有种饥渴
had a hunger...on my skin.

430
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,140
直到我真遇到了一个  我的身体不由自主
It wasn't until I finally met one that my body took over,

431
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:15,830
发起了攻击
and I... I lashed out.

432
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,350
然后我有种释然感
And then I felt relief.

433
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,310
但是有你在
But with you...

434
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,420
安德鲁
Andrew?

435
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,340
你在里面吗
You in there?

436
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,170
你不会理解的  我必须远离你
You wouldn't understand. I had to keep you away.

437
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,850
-所以你才...  -对  我是个懦夫
- That's why you... - Yeah, I was a coward.

438
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,800
我想告诉你的  但我担心
I wanted to tell you, but I was worried that...

439
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,090
你必须明白
you had... you had to know.

440
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,980
我离开你不是因为不爱你
I didn't end things with you because I don't love you.

441
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,720
我是为了保护你
I did it to protect you.

442
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:38,410
我还爱着你  梅琳达
I'm still in love with you, Melinda.

443
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,620
我需要你帮助
And I need your help.

444
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,720
让安保人员离开后他们去了哪里
And where did they go after may dismissed the security detail?

445
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,420
有消息就通知我
Update me as you know more.

446
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,770
一切都好吧
Everything all right?

447
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,090
还不清楚
Not sure yet.

448
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,230
或许只是办公室恋情出了岔子那么简单
Could be as simple as a workplace romance gone wrong.

449
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,460
听上去并不简单啊
That doesn't sound simple.

450
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,130
你刚刚不是正在跟我说
I think you were in the middle of telling me

451
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,900
你和黛西现在多亲了吗
what great friends you and Daisy are now.

452
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,030
我可能有点过分了
I may have overstepped.

453
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:10,240
但有件事可以确定  那姑娘挺有血性
But one thing's for certain... that girl's got fire.

454
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:12,810
你还没跟别人提过她吧
And you still haven told anyone about her.

455
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:14,410
我是遵守承诺的人  菲尔
I keep my promises, Phil.

456
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,770
他们不知道
They have no idea.

457
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,710
新打扮啊
New look?

458
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,310
其实一直这么打扮
Old look, actually.

459
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,770
但好久没系了
It's been a while, though.

460
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,120
我来吧
Uh, may I?

461
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,050
好啊
Sure.

462
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,100
那么
So...

463
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,740
你打算告诉我究竟怎么回事吗
you gonna tell me what really happened?

464
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,980
我可不太相信什么被鲨鱼袭击的说法呢
'cause I'm not quite buying the shark-attack bit.

465
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,530
你不信啊
You're not buying that?

466
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,020
我一个手下给砍掉的
One of my men cut it off.

467
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:45,870
救了我一命
Saved my life.

468
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,210
砍你的手救命吗
By chopping off your hand?

469
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,720
你得在场才会理解
You kind of had to be there.

470
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,630
疼吗
Does it hurt?

471
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,260
每天都疼
Every day.

472
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:57,660
幻肢疼
Phantom pain.

473
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,340
你失去的东西却让你感触最深
Thing that's missing is the thing that you feel the most.

474
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,750
让人难以忘记
Makes it hard to forget.

475
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,360
那就别忘记
So maybe you don't.

476
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,410
但向前看也很重要
But it's also important to look ahead,

477
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,370
看到未来
see what's in front of you.

478
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,510
要到北美防空联合司令部了吗
We close to NORAD?

479
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:19,120
不是  又有一架昆式战斗机请求降落
No. Another quinjet's requested to dock.

480
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,770
林肯  你怎么来了
Lincoln, what are you doing here?

481
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,010
你在哪找到他的
Where'd you find him?

482
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,040
是他来找我的  他有关于鞭笞的情报
He came to me. He's got intel on Lash.

483
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,290
她是ATCU的吗
She ATCU?

484
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,880
我们现在在合作
We're working together now.

485
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,710
是的  我们都想抓住那东西
Yeah, we all want to catch that thing.

486
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:37,310
坎贝尔先生  你都到这儿了
Well, Mr. Campbell, you've come this far.

487
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,370
说说吧
What do you have to say?

488
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:43,360
我们这些从来世出来的人  都会融入环境
Those of us from Afterlife, we were trained to blend in.

489
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,530
来世
Afterlife?

490
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,530
回头跟你讲
I'll explain later.

491
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,140
但那东西却老能找到我们
And yet that thing keeps finding us,

492
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,630
杀了我很多朋友
killed most of my friends.

493
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,970
林肯告诉我一些名字
Lincoln gave me names.

494
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:52,410
我跟我们能辨认的尸体进行了核对
I checked them against the bodies we could identify.

495
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:55,730
所以我知道鞭笞是在用嘉颖的记录本找我们
That's how I knew Lash was using Jiaying's ledger to find us.

496
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,790
她的记录本
Her ledger?

497
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,960
她有一本异人族的族谱
She kept a genealogy of inhumans.

498
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:02,330
只有她可以使用  直到...
She was the only one allowed to use it, until...

499
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,900
直到被神盾局没收
Until S.H.I.E.L.D. recovered it.

500
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,970
据我所知只有一个人能看到这本族谱
And there's only one person I know who had access.

501
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,060
加纳博士
Dr. Garner?

502
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,310
但这不可能啊
But there's no way. It's not possible.

503
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,790
我也不愿相信
I didn't want to believe it, either.

504
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,680
你不止是说安德鲁有记录本
So you're not just saying Andrew has the ledger.

505
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,750
你是说
You're saying...

506
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,420
我今早看到梅查看他的飞行记录
I saw May access his flight logs this morning.

507
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,360
我跟她说过话
I talked with her.

508
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,080
她有些气急败坏  但我以为她是...
She was upset, but I thought that she...

509
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:27,910
她和安德鲁不见了  我刚得到消息
She and Andrew are missing. I just got word.

510
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:28,980
天呐
Oh, god.

511
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,900
改变飞行路线  去纽约
Reroute the plane... New York.

512
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,670
调出茧的卫星录像
Pull all the satellite footage from the Cocoon.

513
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,170
-我们得找到他们  -是  长官
- We need to find them. - Yes, sir.

514
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,970
我真不敢相信我会说这话
I can't believe I'm saying this,

515
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:38,240
但总统只能稍后再说了
but the president's gonna have to wait.

516
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,980
都听你的  我去知会他们
Whatever you need, I'll let them know.

517
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,550
安德鲁不会伤害她的
Andrew wouldn't hurt her.

518
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,800
他都杀了我们那么多人了
He's killed dozens of us.

519
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,370
或许他变身后就不知道自己在做什么了呢
Yeah, well, what if he doesn't know what he's doing once he turns...

520
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:46,930
昏迷过去了什么的
He... he blacks out or something?

521
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:48,920
异人不能变形的  不是那样的
Inhumans can't change form. That's not how it works.

522
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,460
我亲眼看到他的
I saw it myself.

523
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,320
不  我是说  那只是一时的
No, what I'm saying is, it's temporary.

524
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:55,710
他不会一直在人类和怪物之间转变
He won't always be able to shift between monster and man.

525
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,650
他还处于转化中
He's still in transition.

526
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,220
在渐渐变成异人
Becoming inhuman.

527
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,690
等转化完全结束后呢
And when that transition's complete?

528
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,760
他会永远成为鞭笞
He'll stay Lash, permanently.

529
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,010
你以为自己了解的那个人在渐渐消失
The man you think you know is disappearing,

530
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,070
或许他已经不在了
if he's not already gone.

531
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,110
安德鲁
Andrew...

532
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,510
如果不是我出现了
If I hadn't shown up...

533
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,810
你打算伤害乔伊吗
were you going to hurt Joey?

534
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:20,820
当然不会
Of course not.

535
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,440
你也知道我绝不会伤害黛西的
And you know I'd never lay a finger on Daisy.

536
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,950
但你却想伤害林肯
But you went after Lincoln.

537
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,190
那小子有阴暗面
That kid has a dark side.

538
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,650
你比别人都更能理解
You understand more than anyone.

539
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,260
想想巴林岛的事吧
Look at what happened in Bahrain.

540
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:34,540
什么
What?

541
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,370
你亲眼见识过异人族的本事
You saw firsthand what inhumans were capable of.

542
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,720
如果不是你杀了那个小姑娘
If you hadn't killed that little girl,

543
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,410
你周围的所有人都会遭殃
everyone around you would've suffered.

544
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:44,280
他们都会死  是你救了他们
They all would've died. But you saved them.

545
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,590
这不是你
This isn't you.

546
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,140
你绝不会说这种话
You would never say that.

547
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,310
不  梅琳达  我完全明白自己在说什么
No, Melinda, I know exactly what I'm saying.

548
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,810
你和我  我们是一样的
You and me... we're the same.

549
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,230
所以我需要你帮忙
That's why I need your help.

550
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,870
我根本没想伤害那个女孩
I never wanted to hurt that girl.

551
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:57,730
我知道
I know.

552
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:59,050
我知道  相信我
I know, and believe me,

553
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,140
我也不想做我做的这些事
I don't want to do what I'm doing, either.

554
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,460
但我必须做
I have to.

555
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,200
我知道你觉得我是迷失了
I know you think I've lost myself.

556
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,370
我没有
I haven't.

557
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,420
我不知道该怎么办
I don't know what to do.

558
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,820
我知道
I know.

559
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:28,240
还记得我们第一间公寓吗
Do you remember our first apartment?

560
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,890
克兰布鲁克那间
The one on Cranbrook.

561
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:34,800
一卧  破蒲团当床
One room, a stupid futon for a bed,

562
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,200
还有那年冬天  冷得不像话
and that winter when it got so cold, we...

563
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,380
我们用炉子当暖气
We used the oven as our heater.

564
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,540
虽然不是取暖最保险的办法
And not the safest way to keep warm, but...

565
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:42,280
但很好使
it did the trick.

566
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,030
梅琳达
Melinda...

567
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,550
这世界变得更复杂了  是吧
The world has gotten more complicated, hasn't it?

568
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,430
我知道我们不能假装一切不存在
I know we can't pretend it all away.

569
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:09,050
但我还是你爱上的那个男人
But I'm still the same man you fell in love with.

570
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:10,450
我从未放弃你
I never gave up on you.

571
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,370
求你别放弃我
Please don't give up on me.

572
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,590
抱歉打搅了
Sorry to interrupt.

573
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,420
还在等乔伊的重新评估报告呢
Still waiting on Joey's reassessment.

574
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,490
菲尔
Phil...

575
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,940
你不明白
You don't understand.

576
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,130
我开始明白了
I'm starting to.

577
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,170
你没事吧
You all right?

578
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,910
我们是老朋友了
We're old friends.

579
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,970
所以我希望大家都能安安全全地离开
That's why I'd prefer to see everyone walk out of here unharmed.

580
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:45,280
但如果你有别的想法  我可不是一个人来的
But in case you got something else in mind, I'm not alone.

581
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,570
隔离舱安全
Containment module's secure.

582
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,490
收到
Copy that.

583
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:53,220
大堂小队正在就位
Hall team's getting into position.

584
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,750
记住  这是科尔森的行动
Remember, this is Coulson's op.

585
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:01,320
我们听他下令行动
We do not move unless he gives the order.

586
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:02,540
去吧
Go

587
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,950
他是不会束手就擒的
He's not gonna come quietly.

588
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,600
这事不非得悲剧收场
This doesn't have to go down badly.

589
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,630
我会确保你得到照顾
I'll make sure you're taken care of.

590
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,780
我理解你的难处  真的
I understand the position you're in... I do.

591
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,700
我并不羡慕你
And I don't envy it.

592
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,460
但我是在帮你
But I am trying to help you.

593
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,630
我们在面对一场爆发
We've got an outbreak on our hands.

594
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,920
他什么意思
What the hell does he mean by that?

595
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,850
冷静
Calm down.

596
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,220
科尔森有数
Coulson knows what he's doing.

597
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,320
你确定吗
You sure about that?

598
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,590
我只是想把良莠区分开
I'm simply trying to sort the good from the bad.

599
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,530
这是你给我的工作
You gave me this job.

600
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,490
这对治疗师的理解偏差太大了
That's a pretty poor interpretation of a therapist.

601
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,970
看看你周围
Look around you.

602
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,660
我们身处一座废弃大楼  梅被铐着
We're in some abandoned building, May's tied up...

603
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,650
你根本就有事
You're not okay.

604
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:44,600
我知道看上去什么样  但我有道德责任
I know how it looks, but I have a moral responsibility.

605
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,580
你很快就会明白
You'll see, soon.

606
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,330
我是在帮你忙
I'm doing you a favor.

607
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,210
他疯了
He's insane.

608
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:56,100
不是的  他只是病了
That's not true. He's just sick.

609
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,420
那野兽会冒出来的  你控制不了
The beast's gonna come out, and you can't control it.

610
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,700
别因为自己跟他有仇  就恶化情况
Don't make things worse 'cause you got an axe to grind.

611
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,380
他不会乖乖让我们带走他的
He's not just gonna let us take him.

612
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,520
他会防卫自己的
He's gonna defend himself.

613
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,680
别跟他动手
Do not engage.

614
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,120
我们要听科尔森的命令
We move on Coulson's order.

615
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,620
我杀的都是该杀之人
I've only killed those who deserve it.

616
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:20,410
是谁让你做法官  陪审团和刽子手了
Who the hell made you judge, jury, and executioner?

617
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:21,210
你干什么
What are you doing?

618
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:22,660
你得赶紧把他带走
You've got to get him out of here, now!

619
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,560
林肯
Lincoln...

620
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,310
你撕碎了我的朋友  你没这个权利
You tore my friends apart. You have no right!

621
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,920
-够了  -冷静点  安德鲁  求你
- That's enough. - Calm down, Andrew, please.

622
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,360
我完全有权
I have every right.

623
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,020
安德鲁听我说  我们能帮你
Andrew, listen to me. We can help you.

624
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,060
ATCU就快找到治愈方法了
The ATCU is close to a cure.

625
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,910
我就是解决办法
I am the cure.

626
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,190
不
No!

627
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,250
趴下
Get down.

628
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,520
林肯和鞭笞在大楼东侧
Lincoln and Lash are in the east wing of the building.

629
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,840
得把他关进隔离舱里
We have to get him to the module.

630
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,870
是  长官
On it, sir.

631
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:00,600
菲尔
Phil...

632
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,240
我们的目标是抓住他  不是杀了他
Our goal is to capture, not kill.

633
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,840
我们得让林肯也同意
We just got to get Lincoln on the same page.

634
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,910
用这个
Try those.

635
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:29,450
真得把猎枪斧子赶紧做出来了
Really got to commit to that shotgun-axe idea.

636
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,780
我需要帮忙
Could use a little help here!

637
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,830
你位置在哪
What's your twenty?

638
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,480
安德鲁  我们是朋友
Andrew...we're friends.

639
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,220
或许只是熟人而已
Or maybe just acquaintances.

640
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,570
我们围住他了
We got him.

641
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,600
不要
No!

642
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,560
谢谢
Thank you.

643
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,450
你没事吧
Are you okay?

644
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,270
嗯
Yeah.

645
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,360
我不知道你还有这本事
I didn't know you could do that.

646
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,820
我也不知道
That makes two of us.

647
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,820
-他人呢  -我不知道
- Where is he? - No idea.

648
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,950
但我们得把他弄进隔离舱里
But we got to get him to the containment module...

649
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:04,530
得赶紧
Now.

650
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,690
我能把他引过去
I'll get him to where he needs to go.

651
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,050
安德鲁  住手
Andrew, stop!

652
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,190
闪开
Move.

653
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,300
来啊
Go on.

654
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,350
无所谓了
Might as well.

655
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,870
我想过我的死亡很多次
I've thought about my death enough times...

656
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,680
想过各种可能的死亡方式
the different ways that I could go.

657
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,260
但没想到会死在你手上
I just never thought it'd be you.

658
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,880
我一直不明白你为什么会娶我
I never knew why you married me.

659
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:06,950
我从来都不像你那么和气  善解人意
I was never as...kind and empathetic as you.

660
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:11,150
所以我会轻易离开
That's why it was so easy for me to walk away...

661
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:16,060
放弃了你
...why I gave up on you.

662
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,160
我离开你时  失去了一些东西
I lost something when I left you.

663
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,940
我不会再抛弃你一次了
I won't do it again!

664
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,480
但你必须停下来
But you have to stop this.

665
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,460
梅琳达
Melinda...

666
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,260
你怎么知道他不会死啊
How'd you know that wouldn't kill him?

667
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,560
我不知道
I didn't.

668
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,440
我就知道
I bloody knew it.

669
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,890
菲兹  没事吧
Fitz, you all right?

670
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:12,240
嗯  我觉得我...
Yeah, I think I've, uh...

671
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:13,930
记得这个吗
Remember this?

672
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,570
嗯  城堡密室里的
Yeah, from the castle chamber.

673
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:18,630
好的
Okay.

674
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,970
是那个小三吗
Oh, is that the other man?

675
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,700
我要把大家的想法说出来了
Well, I'm just gonna say what we're all thinking...

676
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,710
他长了张猪脸
he has a hog face.

677
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,710
说得太对了啊
He does have a hog face.

678
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:31,620
看看他所在的太空项目的标志
Okay. So, look at the logo of the space program he's with.

679
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,400
远星寻路者计划

680
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:37,840
如果把它倒过来  看上去就很相像了  是吧
And if you turn it upside down, they look similar, yeah?

681
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,520
-有点牵强啊  -可能吧
- Bit of a stretch, mate. - Possible.

682
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,150
好吧
Okay. Well, um...

683
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:44,620
如果在密室门上刻下了这个标识的组织
What if the group who carved this symbol into the chamber door

684
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,430
正是送威尔通过传送门的组织呢
is the same group that sent Will through the portal?

685
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,790
不是宇航局派威尔去的吗
I thought NASA sent Will through.

686
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:50,010
或许远远不止宇航局那么简单
Could go beyond NASA... way beyond.

687
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:52,580
别告诉我你觉得是有什么古老社团在幕后操纵
Please don't tell me you think some ancient order's behind all this,

688
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,650
即便是你  这也太疯狂了
'cause that's a bit mental even for you.

689
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,110
我知道听上去不靠谱
I know how it sounds, but

690
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:59,230
但这可是能通向别的星球的传送门啊
we're dealing with a portal that leads to another planet, so...

691
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,530
一切皆有可能
Anything's possible.

692
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,580
值得查查  菲兹
It's worth checking out, Fitz.

693
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,430
你打算接受科尔森的建议
You gonna take Coulson up on his offer,

694
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,900
多留一阵吗
stick around for a while?

695
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,480
不能一直逃啊
Can't run forever.

696
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,770
如果我们将人形的安德鲁置于静止态
If we put Andrew in stasis as a human,

697
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,050
就能减缓他的转化
it'll slow his transformation,

698
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,540
这样我们也有更多时间找到治愈办法
giving us more time to find a cure.

699
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,430
我不能假装理解你现在的心情
Now, I can't pretend to understand what you're going through,

700
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:33,050
但不管怎样
but for what it's worth...

701
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:38,280
如果我有机会拯救我爱的人  我一定会抓住
if I had the chance to save someone I love, I'd take it.

702
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,350
换了你会怎么办
What would you do?

703
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,070
这
Well...

704
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,430
这是个暂时的办法
it's a temporary solution.

705
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:54,540
这我们都承认
I think we can all acknowledge that.

706
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,910
但安德鲁帮过我
But Andrew helped me.

707
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:01,350
我愿用尽一切办法帮他
So I'd... I'd do whatever it takes.

708
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,000
我同意了
Do it.

709
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,810
你不跟上去吗
Do you need to go after her?

710
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:26,060
她不会想跟我谈的  现在不行
She wouldn't want me to, not right now.

711
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,280
今天好漫长
It's been a long day.

712
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,740
请你喝一杯啊
Buy you a drink?

713
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,280
太好了
Please.

714
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,620
你没事吧
You okay?

715
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,120
我睡不着
I couldn't sleep.

716
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,740
基地的窗户不多  我想
There aren't a lot of windows in the base, and I wanted to...

717
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,080
看日出
Watch the sunrise.

718
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:57,440
我
I, uh...

719
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,740
不能做保证
I can't make any promises,

720
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:03,240
但我可能有发现
but I think I may have found something.

721
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,860
或许能帮我们开启传送门
Might help us open up the portal.

722
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,980
真的吗
Really?

723
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,260
还有
And, um...

724
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:16,200
我修好了你的SIM卡
Fixed your sim card, so...

725
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,060
我听了你的录音  还看了录像
I heard your recordings and saw your video.

726
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:24,360
我还不知道你考虑过在佩思郡安家
Didn't know you thought about settling down in Perthshire.

727
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,220
那是在苏格兰
That's in Scotland.

728
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,460
我知道啦  菲兹
I know where it is, Fitz.

729
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,890
你说的那些话...
So when you said all those things about...

730
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,620
你当时很疲倦又脱水了
I mean, you were tired and deHydrated.

731
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,720
我当时头脑非常清醒
I was as clearheaded then as I've ever been...

732
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,120
我说那些话的时候
when I said all those things.

733
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,630
你觉得我们该怎么办
What do you think we should do about it?

734
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,490
现在
For now.

735
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:07,270
我们先看日出吧
Let's just watch the sunrise.

736
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:34,810
怎么了
What's wrong?

737
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:37,500
没什么
Nothing.

738
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:42,040
我没想到我有资格拥有这个
I never thought I deserved this.

739
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:43,690
什么  夏威夷之旅吗
What, a trip to Hawaii?

740
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:44,980
不是
No.

741
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:50,510
幸福
Happiness.

742
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,810
这样的幸福
This kind of happiness.

743
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,130
你当然有资格
Of course you do.

744
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,130
我们都有
We both do.

745
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:36,760
叫我来做什么
So, why am I here?

746
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,000
稍后再说
We'll get to that.

747
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,250
沃纳・冯・斯特拉克的事真是可惜
It's a shame about Werner Von Strucker.

748
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:46,340
为了你  希望他不会醒过来
I hope, for your sake, he doesn't wake up.

749
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,040
我并不担心
I'm not worried.

750
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,130
他很软弱  就像他父亲
He's weak, like his father.

751
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:53,040
小心哦  沃德先生
Ah, careful, Mr. Ward.

752
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,300
你为他费心费力
You paid a price for that boy.

753
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,450
你该问问自己这是否值得
You should ask yourself if it was worth it.

754
00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:59,510
你把他的位置给了我
You gave me his location.

755
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,310
我是把你要的给了你
I gave you what you asked for.

756
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:07,980
但我不确定你提出的是对的要求
I'm just not sure that you're asking for the right things.

757
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:12,390
复仇只能给人一时的快感
Revenge only provides a temporary pleasure.

758
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,790
但也是快感
But a pleasure, nonetheless.

759
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,560
你该放开眼界  考虑大局
You should think on a grander scale.

760
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,290
会很大的
Oh, it'll be grand.

761
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:28,510
我砍掉神盾局的头怎么样
How about I cut off the head of S.H.I.E.L.D.?

762
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,510
没了菲尔・科尔森
Because without Phil Coulson...

763
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,410
神盾局就长不回来了
S.H.I.E.L.D. won't grow back.

764
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,840
失陪一下
Excuse me a moment.

765
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,840
普莱斯女士
Ms. Price.

766
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,410
我想为错过我们在北美防空联合司令部的见面道歉
I wanted to apologize for missing our meeting at NORAD.

767
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,220
我会尽快带他去见你
I will bring him to you soon enough.

768
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,230
时间就是金钱啊
Time is of the essence.

769
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:01,090
我得挂了  再联系
Oh, I better go. I'll be in touch.

770
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:05,200
你不用这么急着离开
You don't have to leave so soon.

771
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:06,960
先吃点早餐吧
How about some breakfast first?

772
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,970
-你做饭吗  -我从不做饭
- Are you cooking? - I don't cook.

773
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:10,950
但我是吃餐馆的专家
But I'm an expert at going out to eat.

774
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,500
这附近有好地方吗
Is there anything good around here?

775
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,000
鲁斯餐馆  就两个街区
Ruthie's diner is about two blocks away.

776
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:16,650
她家炒蛋很棒
She makes a mean scramble.

777
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,770
我应该还有时间
I think I can make time for that.

778
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,000
太好了
Good.
