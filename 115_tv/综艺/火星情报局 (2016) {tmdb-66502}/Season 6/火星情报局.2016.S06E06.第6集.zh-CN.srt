漫威《神盾局特工》前情回顾
Previously on "Marvel's Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D."...

10
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:04,610
你为什么想重建传送门  珍玛
Why do you want to rebuild the portal, Jemma?

11
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:05,980
因为我必须回去
Because I have to get back there.

12
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,360
我们要把他救回来
We're gonna get him back.

13
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,420
我看到了什么
I saw something.

14
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,040
鞭笞能变回人
Lash can turn into a person.

15
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,170
想想看啊  他可能是任何人
I mean, think about it. He could be anybody.

16
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,250
我知道你非常想参与行动  莫尔斯特工
I know you really want to get back into action, agent Morse,

17
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,270
但不行
but the answer's no.

18
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,320
明白  长官
Understood, sir.

19
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,140
如果我不叫我的手下停手
If I don't call off my men,

20
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,480
安德鲁・加纳博士  就死定了
Dr. Andrew Garner, is a dead man.

21
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,930
你只需要放下武器
All you have to do is put your weapons down,

22
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,020
我就放你走
and I'll let you go.

23
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,010
对不起
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,820
梅特工
Agent May?

25
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:05,770
他还活着
He's alive.

26
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,600
右肺有气胸可能  给他戴上监测仪
Possible pneumo on the right. Let's get him on the monitor.

27
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,810
他有些脱水  我给他再加一升输液
He's dry. I'm starting him on another liter of fluid.

28
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:21,440
安德鲁
Andrew...

29
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,670
怎么回事
What happened?

30
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,240
我去商店
I went into the store.

31
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,200
我有点头疼
I...I had a headache.

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,350
想买点药
I needed something.

33
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,230
我的一个学生也在
One of my students was there.

34
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:30,840
是个
Was, uh...

35
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,970
教授
Hey, professor.

36
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,110
你去哪了
Where you been?

37
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:34,670
转学生
...transfer student.

38
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,540
几周前才开始来上课
He only started a few weeks ago.

39
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,950
跟他一起的还有两个人
Had two men with him.

40
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,790
我也没多少经验
My experience is limited,

41
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,560
但我觉得他们是老手
but I'd say they were professionals.

42
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,730
是九头蛇
It was Hydra.

43
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,850
不知道他们为什么会盯上我
Don't know why they'd be after me.

44
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,300
我知道
I do.

45
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,600
梅  这不是你的错
May, this isn't your fault.

46
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,280
你怎么活下来的
How'd you survive?

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,100
菲尔
Phil.

48
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,430
他派了一个神盾局特工跟着我
He had a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent tailing me.

49
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,850
那人救了我的命
The man saved my life.

50
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,430
他让我有时间躲避
He gave me time to find cover,

51
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,240
他的出现也吓了亚历克斯一跳
and he must've caught Alex off guard

52
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,980
因为事情并没有按照他们的计划进行
because nothing went exactly as planned.

53
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,240
那孩子有个打火机
The kid had a lighter.

54
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,870
我艰难地逃到了门口
I barely made to the door.

55
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,770
我一定是被冲击波震到了安全处
The blast must've thrown me clear.

56
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,110
紧接着我就记得看到你  来接我
The next thing I remember, you were there, picking me up.

57
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,650
我真走运
I'm lucky.

58
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,560
难以想象那种情况怎么能有人幸存下来
Can't see how anyone would've survived that.

59
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:41,300
我知道亚历克斯是个麻烦  但他死了我并不难过
Now, I know Alex is trouble, but I'm not sorry he's gone.

60
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,000
沃德本会逼他杀死我的
Ward would've made him finish the job.

61
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,010
如果沃德...
What if Ward...

62
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,120
他不会的
He won't.

63
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,200
你安全了  有我们呢
You're safe now. We got you.

64
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,130
我们不打扰医生医治你了
We'll let the doctor work on you.

65
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,390
你休息吧
You need to get some rest.

66
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,450
你想去哪
Where the hell do you think you're going?

67
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,970
我想去看看安德鲁
Uh, I think I'm going to see Andrew.

68
00:02:58,970 --> 00:02:59,500
休想
No.

69
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,010
我只想确保他没事
I just want to make sure he's all right.

70
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,710
就是因为你他才有事
You're the reason he's not.

71
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,530
不管怎样沃德都会伤害他的
Ward was gonna hurt him no mat...

72
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,030
-我只是做了最合理的选择  -合理
- I made the most logical choice. - Yeah? Logical?

73
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,210
你是想报仇
You wanted revenge.

74
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,040
科尔森的命令是干掉他
Coulson's orders were to end him.

75
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,490
我有一枪的机会  于是我开枪了
I had one shot. I took it.

76
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,020
而你打偏了  你被撤出任务了
And you missed. You're off that assignment.

77
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,430
很好  那让我去
Good. Then put me on it.

78
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,370
让我去追他
Let me go after him.

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,140
你这算归队了吗
Are you back?

80
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,670
对  我归队了
Yeah, I'm back.

81
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,150
神盾局派了个人来暗杀我
S.H.I.E.L.D. sent a man to assassinate me.

82
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:46,240
他进了我的地盘  还想杀了我
He came into my house and tried to kill me.

83
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,830
就因为你把他放了进来
'cause you let him in.

84
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,810
你大意了
You were sloppy.

85
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,460
我是照你的规矩办事的
I followed your protocol.

86
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,430
他为了接近你不惜杀了个人
He killed a man to get close to you.

87
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,300
他就那么想要你命
He wanted you dead that much.

88
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,200
他们都那么想要我命
They all want me dead that much.

89
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,300
现在还放了个隐患在外面
Now we have a dangling thread.

90
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,430
冯・斯特拉克
Von Strucker.

91
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,690
你就不该派个孩子去做大人的工作
You shouldn't have sent a boy to do a man's job.

92
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:04,860
总不能指望你装成大学生
Not really sure you'd have blended in

93
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,050
混进去盯住加纳吧
as an undergrad, watching Garner.

94
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,650
冯・斯特拉克有打来吗
Has Von Strucker called in?

95
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,750
那他要么被抓了  被杀了  要么就是跑了
So, he's either captured, killed, or he's running.

96
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,170
只有一种可能性是咱们能接受的
And only one of those options works for us.

97
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,680
那小子知道得太多了
The kid knows too much.

98
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,130
那就赶紧找到他  别被神盾局抢了先
So go and find him before S.H.I.E.L.D. does.

99
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,210
要是他还活着
And if he's still alive...

100
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,360
处理好他
Take care of him.

101
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,300
-你还好吗  -我很生气
- How you holding up? - I'm pissed.

102
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,680
我被鞭笞狠整了一顿
I got manhandled by Lash,

103
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,350
还因此失去了看ATCU机构的机会
and it messed up our chance to see the ATCU facility.

104
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,150
但好消息是  我有个想法
But... good news... I have a theory.

105
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,420
我喜欢想法
I like theories.

106
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,340
鞭笞当时追踪了我们
Lash was tracking us.

107
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,340
他知道我们的车在哪
He knew where our truck was.

108
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,660
这可是内部消息
He... he needed inside info for that.

109
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,060
你觉得他能得到ATCU的情报
You think he's got access to ATCU information?

110
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:53,670
不  我...
No, I...

111
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,180
我觉得他就是ATCU的人
I think he's in the ATCU.

112
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,840
我们知道他能在怪物和正常人之间
We know that he can transform himself

113
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,810
来回变化
into a regular-sized guy and back.

114
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,080
要是他伪装成了他们的人呢
What if he's hiding out as one of them?

115
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,540
这想法真可怕
That's a scary thought.

116
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,700
我说服罗莎琳带我参观她今天的行动
I've got Rosalind giving me a tour of her operation today.

117
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,370
-让我看看能查到什么  -好
- Let me see what I find there. - Good.

118
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,330
我看看关于鞭笞的身份我能查到什么
I'll see what I can get on Lash's identity.

119
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,190
不管你在调查什么  尽量别惊动到罗莎琳
And whatever you dig into, try to keep it off Rosalind's radar.

120
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,680
我今天需要她相信我
I need her to trust me today.

121
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,980
你不是搞不定她吧
You're not having a hard time working her, are you?

122
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,370
不会太投入了吧
Not getting too attached?

123
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,920
这一行干久了
You do this long enough,

124
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,110
就能学会如何隔绝自己的感情
you learn to cut yourself off from all that.

125
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,850
这样工作更好做
Makes it easier to do the job.

126
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,760
长官
Sir?

127
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,800
梅真的彻底回归了吗
Is May really back for good?

128
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,140
我不确定
I'm not sure.

129
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,770
现在  她想复仇
Right now, she's out for blood.

130
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,840
梅  我听说安德鲁的事了
May, I heard about Andrew.

131
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,510
他怎么样了
How's he...

132
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:46,620
搞什么
What the hell?!

133
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,480
亨特为了你
Hunter nearly cost Andrew his life,

134
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,650
险些搭上了安德鲁的性命
and he was doing it for you.

135
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,060
我太抱歉了
I-I feel terrible.

136
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,150
你怂恿他
You were egging him on,

137
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,080
让他为你战斗  都是你的错
letting him fight your battles for you. It's your fault!

138
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,270
要是我知道安德鲁会遭遇危险  我绝不会
If I knew Andrew was in danger, I never...

139
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,130
好吧  你不高兴了
Okay. You're upset.

140
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,770
你这不是可以为自己战斗吗
So, you can fight your own battles.

141
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,260
什么
What?

142
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,540
你在考验我
You were testing me?

143
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,690
得确保你可以接任务了
Had to make sure you were mission-ready.

144
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,050
科尔森仍不许我参加作战任务
Coulson still has me off combat duty.

145
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,360
测试表明我的肺仍未痊愈
The tests say that my lung isn't healed all the way yet.

146
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,130
我的测试结果不同
My test says otherwise.

147
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,190
20分钟后出发
Wheels up in 20.

148
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,070
欢迎回来  莫尔斯特工
Welcome back, Agent Morse.

149
00:06:59,310 --> 00:06:59,820
芭比
Bob...

150
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,120
不是你的任务  亨特
Not your mission, Hunter.

151
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,650
离远点  要不然我会让你离远点
Stay away, or I'll make you stay away.

152
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,660
我只想和我前妻说句话
I just want a minute with my ex-wife.

153
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,060
我跟你一起去
I'm going with you.

154
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,220
去你个头
Like hell you are.

155
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,400
你把安德鲁置于险境
You put Andrew at risk.

156
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,370
我都看见沃德了  我当然要开枪了
I had Ward in my sights. Damn right I pulled the trigger.

157
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,150
你是最该能理解的
You of all people should get it.

158
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,240
我能理解
I get it.

159
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,380
你急于诉诸武力  害得一个无辜者受伤
You were quick to violence, and an innocent got hurt.

160
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,400
别人可不像我一样习惯你的行为方式
Other people aren't as used to your behavior as I am.

161
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,480
你什么时候还在乎别人的想法了
Since when do you care what other people think?

162
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,220
你真要回归外勤了吗
You're really going back in the field?

163
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,540
去抓他
After him?

164
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,020
我准备好了
I'm ready.

165
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:36,870
你在撒谎吗
You lying?

166
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,150
没有
No.

167
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,590
那比我干得好点
Do better than I did, yeah?

168
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,020
你不说那句话吗
You're not gonna say the thing?

169
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,750
你已经知道了
You already know.

170
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:09,020
有部分细节安德鲁没说对
Andrew didn't get all the details exactly right.

171
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,110
他说现场有四个人
He said there were four men on the scene,

172
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,980
但只找到了三具尸体
but only three bodies were recovered...

173
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,880
科尔森的手下和两个九头蛇的人
Coulson's man, two Hydra guys.

174
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,880
第四个人是安德鲁的一个学生
The fourth guy was one of Andrew's students.

175
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,780
卡尔弗大学  亚历山大・布朗

176
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,320
这是他的身份证  但这是个化名
That's his I.D., but it's an alias.

177
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,150
他不叫亚历山大・布朗
He's not Alexander Braun.

178
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,840
他叫沃纳・冯・斯特拉克
He's Werner Von Strucker.

179
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,230
等等  冯・斯特拉克  就是那个...
Wait. Von Strucker? As in...

180
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,490
九头蛇万岁
Hail Hydra.

181
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,540
沃德在组建自己的小九头蛇王朝
Ward was starting his own little Hydra dynasty.

182
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,270
真可爱
Cute.

183
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,370
我们找到这个斯特拉克小子
We find the Strucker kid,

184
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,040
他会带我们找到沃德
he'll lead us back to Ward.

185
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:32,940
你有什么办法吗
You got a how?

186
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,360
神盾局一直在监控多个九头蛇的
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s been monitoring several Hydra bank accounts

187
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,480
银行账户
for a while now.

188
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,910
其中一个刚刚有了动静
One just woke up.

189
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,620
开曼群岛
Cayman Islands.

190
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,860
斯特拉克需要钱
Well, Strucker needed funds.

191
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,270
有道理  准备怎么行动
Makes sense. What's the op?

192
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,510
你的普通话怎么样
How's your mandarin?

193
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,660
你觉得呢

194
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,750
如果我们去那里  或许能找到他的踪迹
If we head down there, maybe we'll pick up his trail.

195
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,690
他既要躲沃德  又要躲我们
He's on the run from Ward, from us...

196
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,700
都有点同情这个孩子了
Almost makes me feel sorry for the kid.

197
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,400
他是个怪物
He's a monster.

198
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,150
你叫我来是对的
You were right to ask me to come.

199
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,620
我不知道还能向谁求助
I didn't know where else to turn.

200
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,670
我想你和我父亲
I figured you and my father

201
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,800
肯定经常对付沃德那样的人
must've dealt with guys like Ward all the time.

202
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,430
沃德是个...
Ward is...

203
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,220
我没完成任务
I didn't finish the mission.

204
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,680
他不会在乎原因的
He won't care why.

205
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,390
让一个未受正规训练未经测试的年轻人上场
If you put an untested youth in play without proper training,

206
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,560
这太蠢了
it's foolish.

207
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,970
太令人惊讶了
Boggles the mind, really.

208
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,350
你父亲就明白  保护人才
Your father understood protecting assets

209
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,650
比炫耀他们重要得多
was more important than flaunting them.

210
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,730
他从不让我参与那些事
He never let me in on that stuff.

211
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:26,660
你对我比他好多了
You were nicer to me than he was.

212
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,750
你父亲是个伟大的人
Your father was a great man.

213
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,440
相信我
Trust me.

214
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,210
换了我们绝不会纵容这种事
We would've never put up with such things.

215
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,160
你不了解这个沃德
You don't know this guy Ward.

216
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,680
他很可怕
He's scary.

217
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,180
我很了解格兰特・沃德
I'm aware of Grant Ward.

218
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,980
他也曾是个未经测试的年轻人
He was once an untested youth, too.

219
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,650
每个人都有过去
Everyone has a history.

220
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,980
那么你会帮我吗
So does that mean you'll help me?

221
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,270
我会处理好一切
I'll handle everything.

222
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,880
-多谢你来接我  -是啊
- Nice of you to pick me up. - Yes.

223
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,240
在街角接  因为你不肯告诉我你的基地在哪
On the corner...since you won't tell me where your base is.

224
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,010
你知道我管理的是情报组织吧
You know I run a spy organization, right?

225
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,390
你也知道我们说好了分享情报  对吗
And you know we agreed to share information, right?

226
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,240
什么事
Yeah?

227
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,370
什么时候
When?

228
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,460
知道是谁吗
Do you know who?

229
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,710
好  让他们开始吧
All right, just have them get started.

230
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,730
我这就来
I'm on my way.

231
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:18,910
转弯
Turn around.

232
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,270
我们得回去
We need to head back.

233
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,200
好的  夫人
Yes, ma'am.

234
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,170
抱歉
I'm sorry.

235
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,810
我得处理一项紧急事务  我们改天再约
It's an emergency I need to handle. We'll reschedule.

236
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,780
现在你该下车了
So, this is the part where you get out of the car.

237
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,700
还是算了
I don't think so.

238
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,280
你不明白是怎么回事吗
Do you not get how this works?

239
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,400
我只知道  我该看看这间机构了
What I get is that it's time to see this facility.

240
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:43,880
不能再推迟了
No more delays.

241
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,160
我跟你一起走
I'll stay with you.

242
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,800
处理完紧急事务  我们就可以去了
When the emergency's done, then we can go.

243
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,780
不行  我去的地方你不能去
You can't. Not where I'm going.

244
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,540
那我们现在不分享情报了
So we're not sharing information, then?

245
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,300
你刚刚可是把这事看得很重
'Cause you kind of just made a whole thing about that.

246
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,690
好吧
Okay.

247
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,660
科尔森局长会和我们一起去
Director Coulson will be joining us.

248
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,530
带我回家
Take me home.

249
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,260
我就是觉得我能帮上你
I just thought you could use some help.

250
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:13,670
王舒  凯特琳・芙瑞

251
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,750
我能行  我保证
I've got it. I promise.

252
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,100
我需要集中精力
I just need to concentrate.

253
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,810
是吗
Really?

254
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,830
看上去你的注意力不在这儿呢
Cause it looks like your mind's kind of elsewhere.

255
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:20,300
传送门模拟就在后台开着
The portal simulation is just running in the background.

256
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,870
我并没分心
They're not taking any of my time.

257
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,610
不代表这就是个好主意
Doesn't make it a good idea.

258
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,180
怎么  你不觉得我该帮助西蒙斯营救威尔吗
What? You don't think I should help Simmons rescue Will?

259
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,710
你觉得该吗  他是你的情敌
Do you think you should? He's the competition.

260
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,550
如果你女朋友的前任要从凤凰城来看她
If your girlfriend's ex wants to visit from Phoenix,

261
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,330
你不会给他买机票吧
you do not buy him a plane ticket.

262
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,690
这比喻真具体
That's really specific.

263
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,570
不管怎么说  这人让西蒙斯活了下来
Anyway, this guy kept Simmons alive.

264
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,660
我欠他的  他值得我去救
I owe him. He deserves my help.

265
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,540
就因为他给了西蒙斯几个月的温暖...
Just because he kept Simmons warm for a few months...

266
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,910
通过生火...
with fire...

267
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,660
不代表你该救他
Doesn't mean he's someone you should save.

268
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,530
你对他了解多少啊
How much do you even know about him?

269
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,160
你在干什么
What're you doing?

270
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,540
我是说  在这里  你为什么在这里
In here, I mean. Why are you here?

271
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,850
科尔森不让我参与行动
Coulson put me on the bench.

272
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,830
我就想着我可以在别处发光发热
So I thought I would offer my expertise elsewhere.

273
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,640
你就取个"凯特琳・芙瑞"
Is that what you're going with... "Katelin Frayer"?

274
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,090
你怎么这么拼"凯特琳"
Is that how you spell "Katelin"?

275
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,250
凯特琳・芙瑞

276
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,340
KAT...
K-a-t...?

277
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,760
这么拼不对吧  伙计
I'm not sure that's right, mate.

278
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,280
嗯  不..."凯特琳"有很多种拼法
Yeah, no, th... there's lots of ways to spell "Katelin."

279
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,330
你能不能找别处
And can you please just find somewhere else

280
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:18,650
发光发热去
to make yourself useful?

281
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,440
收到
Copy that.

282
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,750
加纳博士  很高兴你起来活动了
Dr. Garner, good to see you up.

283
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,200
有时间做咨询吗
Do you have time for a consult?

284
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,780
天哪  好啊  快说吧
Oh, god, yes, please.

285
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,720
我没想说得那么迫不及待的
That came off more desperate than I intended.

286
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,200
躺着实在太无聊
Being laid up is very boring.

287
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,710
-怎么了  -是关于鞭笞
- What's up? - It's Lash.

288
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,940
-鞭笞  -那个异人杀人恶魔
- Lash? - The inhuman killer monster.

289
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,060
对了  我听说你们打了个照面
Oh, right. I heard you had a run-in with him.

290
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,360
还好你没事
Glad you're okay.

291
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,880
这就是我不理解的地方
That is what I don't understand.

292
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,610
为什么我没事  他专杀异人
Why am I okay? He kills inhumans.

293
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:54,130
他杀了弗莱  为什么要放过我
He killed Frye. Why spare me?

294
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,580
问得好
That's a tough one.

295
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,370
我还在梳理异人族的心理状态呢
Still trying to put together an inhuman psych profile.

296
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,540
你们都各有特点
You're all different.

297
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,430
是啊  但他...格外独特
Yeah, but he's... Really different.

298
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:10,100
他变身成了人形  一个普通的人类
He changed into a guy... a regular guy.

299
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,550
你看见他了吗
You saw him?

300
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,270
你有看清楚吗
Did you get a good look at him?

301
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,980
没  只看到个影子  但还是
No, just a shadow, but still...

302
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,490
我都不知道还能这样
I didn't know that was possible.

303
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,240
我也是  但是那家伙那么大又那么丑
Me, either, but someone that big and ugly...

304
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,760
这也合乎逻辑
I mean, it makes sense.

305
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,940
他总得有办法掩人耳目
He's got to get around without being noticed somehow.

306
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,220
林肯说不定能帮上忙呢
Maybe Lincoln can help.

307
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,070
-你知道他在哪吗  -不清楚
- You know where he is? - No idea.

308
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,350
自从ATCU企图抓他  他就失踪了
He's been off the grid since the ATCU tried picking him up,

309
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,020
-但他偶尔会打电话来  -震动女  有空吗
- but he calls sometimes. - Hey, tremors, you got a sec?

310
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,470
是的
Yeah.

311
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,290
谢谢
Thank you.

312
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,640
有消息告诉你
I'll keep you posted.

313
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,040
什么事
What's up?

314
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,460
我在考虑你关于ATCU的假设
Been thinking about your ATCU theory.

315
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,210
谁在护卫队出发前先走了
Now, who took off before the convoy left,

316
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:46,450
谁知道我们走的路线
and who knew the exact route we were going to take?

317
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,140
班克斯
Banks.

318
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,740
他可以查到ATCU掌握的一切关于异人族的信息
He's got access to everything that ATCU learns about inhumans.

319
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,830
卢瑟・班克斯

320
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,880
我们应该跟踪他
We should tail him.

321
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,910
车已经准备好了  全套监控设备
Already got a van ready to go, full surveillance package.

322
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,370
红外线扫描器  单向玻璃
Infrared scanners, one-way glass...

323
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,330
-太好了  让我准备一下  -我来开车
- Perfect. Let me get some things. - I'll drive.

324
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,390
我是说
I mean...

325
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,070
求你们了
Please.

326
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:13,610
大开曼岛

327
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,240
王小姐想查看她的保险箱
Ms. Wong would like to access her safe-deposit box.

328
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,520
这是她的帐户号码
Here's her account number.

329
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,720
请出示你们的身份证
I will need your I.D.s, please.

330
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,910
当然
Of course.

331
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,380
希望菲兹没有搞砸

332
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,820
警棍准备好

333
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,510
王小姐说她喜欢你的领带
Ms. Wong likes your tie.

334
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,010
请跟我来
Follow me.

335
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,240
开始了

336
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,940
你们慢慢看  不用着急
Take as much time as you need.

337
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,930
38号箱
Box 38.

338
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,710
菲兹  我们需要斯特拉克的全部信息
Fitz, we need anything on strucker,

339
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,040
能找到沃德的一切线索
anything that will get us to Ward.

340
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,660
收到
Yeah, getting it.

341
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,060
房产证  护照
Real-estate deeds, passport...

342
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,150
没有现金吗
No cash?

343
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,800
他肯定把那些都拿走了  他大概...
He must've cleared it all out. He...

344
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,980
等下  你们好像触动了警报
Oh, uh...Guys, I think you triggered an alarm somewhere.

345
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:50,950
这可好
Great.

346
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,160
我们还剩多长时间
How much time do we have?

347
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,310
看来没时间了
Looks like zero.

348
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,530
这下糟了

349
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,230
怎么回事
What is happenning in here?

350
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,140
我拿下左边那个

351
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,600
你对付右边那个

352
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,100
经理不成问题

353
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,590
-我老板想祝贺你们  -什么
- My boss would like to congratulate you. - What?

354
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,390
什么

355
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,100
你们的安保系统真是一流
Your security system is top-notch,

356
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,900
团队也很高效
and your team is incredibly efficient.

357
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,990
正如我们的期待
Just what we'd hoped for.

358
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,420
你在跟我开玩笑吗

359
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,560
我们一直在关注你们公司
We've been reading up on you.

360
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,890
我明白你要做什么了  稍等
Oh, I see where you're going with this. One second.

361
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,620
我们想给你们提供一份工作
We'd like to offer you a job.

362
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,820
工作
A job?

363
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,520
这可太不寻常了
This seems most unorthodox.

364
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,510
我们是受你前雇主的托付
We were sent from your former employer,

365
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,170
国家第一信托公司
First Fiduciary National,

366
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,530
他们希望你能回去工作
and they would like you back.

367
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:49,310
我知道你过得不易  你妻子想回迈阿密
I know it's been hard, your wife missing miami.

368
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,000
你们分居多久了
How long have you been separated?

369
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,740
你怎么知道这个
You know about that?

370
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,540
这真不是一个好主意

371
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,630
你现在的工资只比2012年多4%
You're only earning 4% more than you were in 2012.

372
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,050
我们能让你赚更多
We can do better.

373
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,520
太过分了

374
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,390
我的确一直想换个工作
I... I have been looking to make a change.

375
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,550
你看  这手段不挺好使

376
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,800
他可不觉得

377
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,930
现在  用我的办法吧

378
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:21,940
不好意思
Sorry.

379
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,680
HTS家庭影院系统

380
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,370
还没来人
No one yet.

381
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,480
班克斯还没回来
Banks still not back.

382
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,270
他37秒前也没回来呢
He wasn't back 37 seconds ago, either,

383
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,950
但是谢谢你的定期提醒
but thanks for the regular updates.

384
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,550
这家伙不是善类
This guy is bad news.

385
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,320
被海军陆战队踢出
Got discharged from the marines.

386
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,130
是有原因的
With cause.

387
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,660
但是罗莎琳还是雇了他
And Rosalind hired him anyway.

388
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,070
纽约一役后  他加入了一支抗外星人精英特遣队
He was part of an Elite Anti-Alien Task Force after New York.

389
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,060
当然了
Of course he was.

390
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,910
他回来后到底有什么计划
So what's the plan when he gets back?

391
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,810
我们要把他抓回去审问吗
Is this a grab-and-torture kind of deal?

392
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,760
如果他是鞭笞  那锁喉大概没用
Chokehold might not work if he turns out to be Lash.

393
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,800
但是我们可以
But we could...

394
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,880
别心急  关塔那摩  你不是只想开车吗
Slow down, Gitmo. I thought you just wanted to drive.

395
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,080
只是给你们点有用的建议
Just offering helpful suggestions.

396
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,000
到底怎么个有用法
Helpful in what way, exactly?

397
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,660
可以阻止坏人吗
Um... stopping bad guys?

398
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,250
不如专业点
How about professionalism?

399
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,810
做事机灵点  别害死人
Doing your job smart, not getting people killed?

400
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,930
大胆猜测一下  你不是在说跟踪班克斯的事吧
Wild guess... this isn't about following Banks.

401
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:16,510
亨特  安德鲁差点死了
Hunter, come on. Andrew almost died.

402
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,780
说出来了
And there we have it.

403
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,250
我又不是把安德鲁交了出去  然后说
Look, it's not like I just handed over Andrew and said,

404
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,670
杀了我们的朋友吧
"Hey, please kill our friend."

405
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,830
是啊  "我别无选择"
Right. "I had no choice."

406
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,220
我是别无选择
I had no choice.

407
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,710
-我  -先别吵  快看
- I... - Guys, guys.

408
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,450
看来我们要跟着他回家了
Looks like we're following him home.

409
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,700
保持安全距离
At a safe distance!

410
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,840
罗莎琳・普莱斯  ATCU
Rosalind price, ATCU.

411
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,760
是  长官
Yes, ma'am.

412
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,080
抱歉在这种情况下见面
Sorry about the circumstances.

413
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,830
我们会尽力查明闯入者的身份
We'll do our best to make sure we find whoever broke in here.

414
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,350
有人闯进了你家吗
Someone broke into your home?

415
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,140
-有线索吗  -还没
- Any leads? - Not yet.

416
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,620
看来此人被你
Looks like the guy was scared away

417
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:06,050
惊人的安全系统给吓跑了
by your, uh... very impressive security system.

418
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,860
我们能到处看看吗
All right if we take a look around?

419
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,030
当然
Of course.

420
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,150
你不行
Not you.

421
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,180
这边请
This way.

422
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,040
地方不错啊
Nice place, huh?

423
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,870
从一个女人的藏书能了解她很多事
Can tell a lot about a woman from her books.

424
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,590
好吧  我还真不知道有这么多
Okay, I didn't actually know that there were this many

425
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,320
玛格丽特・撒切尔的传记呢
biographies of Margaret Thatcher.

426
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,670
新家具
New furniture.

427
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,260
崭新的
Brand-new.

428
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,010
老天  你怎么弄到...
Holy... where did you get...

429
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:51,020
别碰我的东西
Don't touch my things.

430
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,080
抱歉  丢东西了吗
Sorry. Anything missing?

431
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,140
我和警察讲话时你没偷听吗
You weren't listening in when I talked to the cop?

432
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,670
你变迟钝了  菲尔
You're slipping, Phil.

433
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:01,420
我以为你肯定会想搞些情报呢
I thought you'd definitely be scoping things out.

434
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,970
他打完电话就会回去家里
He's gonna go back inside when he finishes his call.

435
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,150
我们接下来怎么做
What's our next move?

436
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,930
他进了房子  我们今天就什么都做不了了
He goes in his house, we're done for the day.

437
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,440
我还不想放弃
I don't want to give up on him yet.

438
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,320
我可以闯进他车里
I could break into his car,

439
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,450
在速度计上放个针孔摄像头
drop a spot cam in his speedometer.

440
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,510
我们得隐秘一点
We have to be stealthy.

441
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,810
如果他发现你  我们就完了
If he catches you, we're toast.

442
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,180
科尔森正深入虎穴
Coulson is in the belly of the beast.

443
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,300
我们不能让ATCU知道我们在调查他们
We can't tip off the ATCU that we're on to them.

444
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,600
一定有什么办法可以...
There must be some way we can keep...

445
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:42,660
怎么...
What...

446
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,460
不
Oh, no.

447
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,500
什么情况
What's happening?

448
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,800
不是吧
Come on!

449
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,820
还说要隐秘一点呢
So much for stealthy.

450
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,910
搞定了
Here we go.

451
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,680
这怎么是个好主意了
And this is a good idea how?

452
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,920
我没杀他  我只是冻住了他
I didn't kill him, I-I just iced him.

453
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,370
你还坑了科尔森
And screwed Coulson.

454
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:16,470
他正在对付罗莎琳  你刚刚射了她二把手
He's working Rosalind, and you just shot her number two.

455
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,630
-等她发现...  -她不会发现的
- When she finds out... - She won't.

456
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,270
我蒙了面
That's what the bandana's for.

457
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,660
鞭笞是异人
Lash is an inhuman.

458
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,650
异人的DNA上有标记
Inhumans have markers in their DNA.

459
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,620
如果我们给班克斯验血查标记
If we test Banks' blood for markers,

460
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,350
就能知道他是不是异人了
we'll know if he's inhuman or not.

461
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,330
还真是个好办法
That's actually kind of smart.

462
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:35,650
多谢
Thank you.

463
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:37,770
但我还是觉得你该谈谈你的愤怒问题
But I still think you need to talk about your anger issues.

464
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:38,850
这里也不是医务室
And this isn't the med lab.

465
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:41,090
我们没有器具可以采集班克斯的血样
We don't have the equipment to draw Banks' blood.

466
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,160
好吧
Okay.

467
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,810
有血了
There you go... blood.

468
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,450
好吧  我可能有点愤怒问题
Okay, there might be a small anger issue.

469
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,840
把棉签给我
Just pass me the swab.

470
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,510
我只是说你经历了一件很极端的事情
All I'm saying is that you've been through something extreme.

471
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,740
必然会产生后遗症的
There will be after-effects.

472
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,880
这话耳熟吗
Sound familiar?

473
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:08,210
这样的角色反转真是让人开眼界
It's eye-opening, being on this side of the counseling.

474
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,360
大家小心翼翼地待你
People treat you with kid gloves.

475
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,500
他们是好意  但他们越是想帮忙
They mean well, but the more they try to help...

476
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,160
你越觉得无力
The weaker you feel.

477
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:17,230
或许是我们的学位的关系
Maybe it's our PhDs.

478
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:21,520
让他们低估了我们有多么坚强
Makes them underestimate just how strong we really are.

479
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,500
或许吧
Might just be.

480
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,990
抱歉
Excuse me.

481
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:26,820
黛西
Daisy?

482
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,750
珍玛  我知道你一直没回实验室
Jemma, I know you haven't been in the lab

483
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,800
我也很不想叫你干活儿  但如果
and I hate to ask you to do work, but if...

484
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,010
其实  我能行的
In fact, I can handle it, actually.

485
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,640
不管是做什么
Whatever it is.

486
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,430
你有时间做个血检吗
Do you have time to run a blood analysis?

487
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,640
我想看看班克斯是不是有异人DNA标记
I want to see if Banks has inhuman markers.

488
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,610
我有的是时间  发过来吧
I have plenty of time. Send away.

489
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,140
谢谢  珍玛
Thank you, Jemma.

490
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,200
-有结果告诉你  -好
- I'll call when I know. - Okay.

491
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,670
怎么样
Anything?

492
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:50,980
他在好事多购物
Guy shops at costco.

493
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,260
有用的信息呢
Anything useful?

494
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,840
连张自拍都没有
There's not even any selfies.

495
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,770
班克斯  你真无趣
Banks, you are boring.

496
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,840
除了他可能是个超级大怪物
Well, apart from the fact that he might be a giant beast

497
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,440
在人胸腔上开洞这一点...
who blows holes in people's chests, but...

498
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,840
不是我  不是我干的
I-I-I didn't do it. I-it wasn't me.

499
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,940
我
I...

500
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,280
我们知道  那是部电话
We know. It's a phone.

501
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,570
"对象正被送往恩德塔克斯"
"Subject en route to Endotex."

502
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,490
没有来电显示
No caller I.D.

503
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:15,690
盖瑟斯堡的恩德塔克斯实验室吗
Something called Endotex Labs in Gaithersburg?

504
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,790
我们可以去看看  怎么样
We could check it out. What do you think?

505
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:19,470
西蒙斯拿回结果之前还有时间
Well, we've got time before Simmons comes back with results.

506
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,350
那他呢
What about him?

507
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,290
可以带上他
We could take him with us.

508
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:24,040
我试过跟鞭笞困在一辆开动的车里
I've been trapped in a moving vehicle with Lash before.

509
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,310
可不想再来一次
Don't love the idea of it happening again.

510
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:28,350
是啊  如果他有那个DNA标记
Yes, if he has the DNA markers,

511
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,880
我们也知道去哪找他
we know where to find him.

512
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,940
走吧
Let's go.

513
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,960
警方完事了
Cops finished up.

514
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,820
我让我的司机给我们买了汉堡
Had my driver pick up some burgers for us.

515
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,200
我觉得你可能想吃点
Figured you could use some dinner.

516
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,070
街角DJ店的
DJ's from around the corner?

517
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,450
你的电脑还在
So, your computer's still here.

518
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,180
还有两台电视
Couple of TVs, too.

519
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,690
以及挺贵重的艺术品
Some big-time art pieces, I noticed.

520
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,610
不算贵重啦
Hardly big-time.

521
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,880
凑合了
Nice, maybe.

522
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,100
有贼闯进来  却不偷东西  很不寻常啊
Unusual for thieves to break in and not take anything.

523
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,230
我走运吧
Well, lucky me.

524
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,360
-你想说什么吗  -我不知道
- You got a point? - I don't know.

525
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,790
如果你是想挣我的同情分
If you were looking to earn some sympathy from me,

526
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,470
让我心软
soften me up, say,

527
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,830
布置一场闯入也算是个办法
a staged break-in might be one way to do it.

528
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:15,980
有意思
Interesting.

529
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,530
还有一点也很有意思  我家偏偏
Also interesting, my home had a break-in

530
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:21,960
在你知道我不在的这天头一次被人闯入了
for the first time ever on the exact day you knew I'd be out.

531
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,480
这指控很严重啊
That's a serious accusation.

532
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,570
你刚刚还指责我假装被闯空门
You just accused me of staging a break-in,

533
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,400
我为什么要这么做呢
which I did why, exactly?

534
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,130
或许我不会喜欢在ATCU机构看到的场面
Maybe I won't like what I see at the ATCU facility,

535
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,740
所以你想让我喜欢你
so you're trying to make me like you.

536
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,010
从雷鸟汽车开始做我工作
Working me ever since the Thunderbird.

537
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,990
显得自己有人情味  让我好接受
Humanizing yourself so I'll take it better.

538
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,620
我真是个疯狂天才啊
I am quite the mad genius, huh?

539
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,790
这些东西真的都是你的吗
Is all this stuff really yours?

540
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,870
我得承认  那根球棒  太聪明了
I got to admit, the bat... that was a nice touch.

541
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:50,540
三冠王  米奇・曼托
Triple crown winners, autographs from Mickey Mantle,

542
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,080
泰德・威廉姆斯  弗兰克・罗宾逊
Ted Williams, Frank Robinson,

543
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,340
和卡尔・雅泽姆斯基的签名
Carl Yastrzemski?

544
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,070
大部分人看一眼不会知道
Most people just looking at that wouldn't know

545
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,870
那东西价值超过七千  但我知道
that it's worth over 7 grand, but I do.

546
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:57,730
好了  那球棒不是
Okay, the bat is not...

547
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,530
还有我最喜欢的餐馆DJ店的汉堡
And burgers from my favorite place, DJ's.

548
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,350
ATCU的头头有什么原因
What possible reason would the head of the ATCU have

549
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,110
要用这个留住我
for keeping me here with that?

550
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,230
是啊
You're right.

551
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,560
没有任何原因
No reason at all.

552
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,050
你想去看机构吗
You want to go see the facility?

553
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,700
好啊
Fine.

554
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,580
我们去吧
Let's go see the facility.

555
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,710
好了  每张护照
Okay, each of those passports

556
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:34,110
都是一个冯・斯特拉克的假身份
has a different fake identity for Von Strucker.

557
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:37,150
顺说  我的手艺更好
My work is better, just for the record.

558
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,660
-我们知道啦  -嗯
- We know. - Right.

559
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:41,050
其中一个身份与
Well, one I.D. matches the name

560
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:43,420
一栋斯特拉克的地产相匹配
on one Strucker real estate holding...

561
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,200
是葡萄牙里斯本的一栋顶层公寓
A penthouse in Lisbon, Portugal.

562
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,160
我检查了一下到达里斯本机场的乘客
So I did a sweep of passengers arriving at the Lisbon airport.

563
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:50,530
他几小时前通过了海关
He went through customs several hours ago.

564
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:52,130
干得好  菲兹  谢谢
Nice work, Fitz. Thank you.

565
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:52,670
不客气
You're welcome.

566
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,670
那我们就去里斯本的那栋顶层公寓
So, we go to a penthouse in Lisbon.

567
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,210
你想谈谈之前银行的事吗
You want to talk about what happened at the bank?

568
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,330
没什么好说的
There's nothing to discuss.

569
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,330
我是把动手当作最后手段
I was treating fighting as a last resort.

570
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,730
这一般是没问题的
Usually, that's good.

571
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:09,910
一般
Usually.

572
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,040
有时候是因为你害怕
Sometimes it's 'cause you're gun shy.

573
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,850
或许我是没完全恢复  但是是你
Maybe I'm not 100%, but you're the one

574
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,630
不顾测试结果  把我叫来执行任务的
who dragged me on this mission, in spite of the tests.

575
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,450
别拿测试做借口了
Stop hiding behind the tests.

576
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,060
我没有
I'm not.

577
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:21,580
我说过我想回归外勤
I said I wanted back in the field.

578
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,450
是啊
Sure.

579
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:25,130
巴林岛一事后  我也说过我讨厌我的小隔间
After Bahrain, I said I hated my cubicle.

580
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,090
但不是真心的
Didn't mean it.

581
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:28,940
科尔森让你待在基地  你就听了
Coulson says, "Stay home," and you just agree?

582
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,180
你为什么把自己关起来
Why are you keeping yourself locked up?

583
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,640
我去学院找好苗子时  见过你训练的样子
You know, I saw you train at the academy once, scouting you.

584
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,250
我不知道
I didn't know that.

585
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,150
我见过的最厉害的新人
Strongest recruit I ever saw.

586
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,770
任何测试都会表明你当时是满分
Any test would've said you were 100% then.

587
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:48,240
但你现在更棒了  因为现在你有了经验
But you're better today because now you have experience.

588
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,860
沃德做的事
What Ward did...

589
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,380
你觉得那只是段经历吗
You think that was just experience?

590
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,250
那可以让你更加强大
That can make you stronger.

591
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,220
让它把你变得更强大
Let it.

592
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,790
下次  我们可能就不能靠耍嘴皮子了
'cause next time, talking our way out may not be an option.

593
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,090
手雷

594
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,250
小心点啊
Careful with that one.

595
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:11,420
我们要是还没搬进来就把这儿炸平可就不好了
Be a shame to see this whole place blow up before we even move in.

596
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,150
你在这儿做什么
What the hell are you doing here?

597
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:16,000
你不是该出去找冯・斯特拉克的吗
You're supposed to be out looking for Von Strucker.

598
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,040
你是谁
Who is this?

599
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,760
你不知道我是谁
You don't know my name,

600
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,950
但我觉得你一直想引起我的注意
but I think you've been trying to get my attention.

601
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,360
我还想我什么时候能接到你的电话呢
I've been wondering when I'd hear from you.

602
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:38,170
你就是我出现之前  其他人都怕的人
You're the one all the others were afraid of... before me.

603
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,330
并不是每个人都怕你  沃德先生
Not everyone fears you, Mr. Ward.

604
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:42,950
不是每个人都该怕我
Well, not everyone should.

605
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,100
只有那些不肯配合的需要怕
Just the ones who won't fall in line.

606
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:46,840
我能为你做什么
What can I do for you?

607
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,930
不  这个问题不对
No, that's not the correct question.

608
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:53,320
该问的是  我能给你什么
The correct question is what I can offer you.

609
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,860
如果你想知道  答案是  挽救机会
The answer, in case you're wondering, is redemption.

610
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,900
不了  谢谢  我不需要那个
Oh, no, thanks. I don't need redeeming.

611
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,440
我觉得你需要
Oh, I think you do.

612
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,970
你走错了几招
You made some mistakes in your gameplay,

613
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,950
你拿冯・斯特拉克的儿子当卒子用
using Von Strucker's son as a pawn

614
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,670
而他根本还不该加入
when he shouldn't even be on the board yet.

615
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:13,090
你瞧  这就是你们那代人的通病
You see, that's just typical of guys in your generation.

616
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,130
你都不知道我使的是什么招
You don't even know the game I'm playing.

617
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:18,840
冯・斯特拉克可不止是个小卒子
Von Strucker is more than just a pawn.

618
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,250
现在他成了麻烦
And now he's a liability.

619
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,810
他知道太多事了
He knows too much.

620
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,870
我说错了吗
Just tell me if I'm wrong.

621
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,010
你毁了这个人才
You burned that asset.

622
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,960
神盾局在找他  那么你肯定也是
S.H.I.E.L.D. is looking for him, which means so are you.

623
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,900
我知道你在哪可以找到他
And I know where you can find him.

624
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,530
你就准备这么告诉我吗
And you'll just tell me that?

625
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,170
为什么
Why?

626
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,650
有时候得肯牺牲  才能保全大局
Sometimes you sacrifice a player to save the game.

627
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:48,980
记住  我打给你  就是选择了一边站
You just remember when I come calling that I chose a side.

628
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,440
就是这里
This is the place.

629
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,150
恩德塔克斯的所在地
Matches the Endotex location.

630
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:00,590
高压镀锌铁丝网  还有虹膜识别
High-voltage, zinc-coated razor wire, iris recognition?

631
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,780
密密麻麻的外围巡逻
Staggered perimeter patrols.

632
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,640
这地方不欢迎外人呢
They don't want any visitors.

633
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,340
肯定是个门面  是吧
It's got to be a front, don't you think?

634
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,300
那怎么办
So what now?

635
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,360
我们出动菲兹新做的探测器
Now we use the new dwarf Fitz crafted.

636
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,770
他觉得这东西还没完成
He doesn't think it's ready yet,

637
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:14,590
但他是犯傻  这东西帅爆了
but that's stupid because it's awesome, so...

638
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,600
我就给偷来了
I stole it.

639
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,670
怎么了
What?

640
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,490
你不是唯一有点问题的人啊
I didn't say you were the only one with issues.

641
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,410
好了
All right.

642
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,970
西蒙斯  什么结果
Simmons, what do you got?

643
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,870
没有  班克斯没有异人DNA标记
It's negative. Banks has no inhuman markers.

644
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,040
他不是异人
He's not inhuman.

645
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:53,740
他不是鞭笞喽
So he's not Lash.

646
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,070
不是吧
Really?

647
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,300
我真以为是他呢
I was so sure.

648
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,420
好吧  谢了
Okay. Thanks.

649
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,030
菲兹
Fitz?

650
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,070
我帮完黛西了
I'm done helping Daisy.

651
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,600
既然你也帮完了芭比和梅
And since you're done helping Bobbie and May,

652
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,850
或许现在我们可以看看模拟结果了
I thought maybe now we could take a look at the simulation.

653
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,140
珍玛  我一直想跟你说
Jemma, I've been meaning to say to you...

654
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,710
如果你不乐意帮忙我也完全理解
Look, I understand if you don't want to look into this.

655
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,920
我比你想的坚强
I'm stronger than you think.

656
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,700
不不  珍玛  我研究过了
No, no, no, no, Jemma, I have looked into it.

657
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,200
实际上  我做过几十次模拟了
Actually, I've run dozens of simulations,

658
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,850
而且一直希望能有一次
and I kept on hoping that one of them...

659
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:30,990
得到结果
would work.

660
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,350
我
I...

661
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,720
我是不想让你失望
I didn't want to disappoint you.

662
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,140
但巨石只是一种选择
The monolith was just one option, though.

663
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:43,530
我们不会放弃的  好吗
We're not gonna give up, okay?

664
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:50,090
我知道这对你很艰难
I know this isn't easy for you.

665
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,260
这个状况很奇怪
It's an odd situation.

666
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,530
是啊
Yeah.

667
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:56,140
简直怪到极点了  即使对我们而言
It's one of the oddest, even for us.

668
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:58,380
菲兹  如果你认识威尔  你就会理解的
Fitz, if you knew Will, you'd understand.

669
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,120
-我保证  -珍玛  就是这样
- I promise... - Jemma, that's the thing.

670
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,250
我会认识他的
I am gonna know him.

671
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,140
这毫无疑问
It's not even a question.

672
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,990
威尔・丹尼尔斯将带领卫星救援行动  威尔・丹尼尔斯任务概览

673
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:23,460
家乡英雄威尔・丹尼尔斯

674
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,390
我不管血检结果是什么
I don't care what the blood work says.

675
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,790
那个班克斯很狡猾
That guy Banks is shifty.

676
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,780
他曾把我扣在一辆地铁上
You know he once held me prisoner on a train.

677
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:30,460
让我很不爽
Didn't care for that.

678
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:32,510
班克斯还在往这边走
Banks was still on his way here.

679
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,270
恩德塔克斯显然是ATCU的门面
Endotex is obviously a front for ATCU.

680
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,420
里面肯定有问题
No, there's something here.

681
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:38,050
或许探测器能找到什么
Maybe the dwarf will find something

682
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:40,100
那样今天也不会白费了
So today won't have been pointless.

683
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:43,100
班克斯是来送什么东西的
Banks wanted to be here for a delivery of something.

684
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:44,800
不知道是什么
I wonder what it is.

685
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,110
他们不会看到探测器吗
But won't they see the dwarf?

686
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:59,830
不会的  这是2.0版的
They will not. That's the 2.0.

687
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:06,140
菲兹可不该把这东西藏起来呢
Fitz should not be keeping that locked up.

688
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,340
等等  那是什么
Wait a minute, what is that?

689
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,540
我不...
I don't...

690
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:14,350
安全
Clear.

691
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,080
那是个人吗
Is that a person?

692
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,300
天呐
Oh, god.

693
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,740
他死了吗
Is he dead?

694
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,950
不  他们在监测他  他还活着
No, they're monitoring him. He's alive.

695
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,200
但怎么回事  陷入昏迷了吗
But in some kind of what? A coma?

696
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:34,960
这是ATCU干的
This is ATCU.

697
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:40,110
他们在这里存储他们找到的异人
This is where they're storing inhumans they find.

698
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,590
像笼中兽一样
Like animals in cages.

699
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,020
我找个更好的角度
Let me get a better shot.

700
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,260
能调大点声吗  什么都听不到
Can we turn it up? I can't hear a thing.

701
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,000
调大了
It's up.

702
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,440
只能靠这么近了  否则会暴露
This is as close as we can get without giving ourselves away.

703
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,030
背景有杂音
There's noise in the background.

704
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,500
我知道这看上去像什么
I know how it looks.

705
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:16,020
他应该很震惊才对
He should be freaking out.

706
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,120
这种事应该让人震惊才对
This is the sort of thing that should freak a person out.

707
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,810
他为什么还没有把这里烧成平地啊
Why is he not burning this place to the ground?

708
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,690
他在告诉她他的想法
He... he's telling her what he thinks.

709
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:23,140
他跟我们一样吓坏了
He's horrified, like we are.

710
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:24,860
看上去可不像是那样
It doesn't look like it.

711
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,580
把探测器拉回来  别暴露了我们
Look, bring back that dwarf. Make sure we're not discovered.

712
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,220
我们现在不可能再跟ATCU合作了
There's no way we're working with the ATCU now.

713
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,700
震动女
Tremors...

714
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:37,240
黛西  探测器  撤回来
Daisy, the dwarf... bring it back.

715
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:38,900
好吧
All right.

716
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,930
是挺有效率
It's efficient, I'll say that.

717
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,040
那是什么  冻结胶质吗
What is it? Some kind of suspension gel?

718
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:56,320
可以让他们处于静止态  健康鲜活  但沉睡着
It keeps them in stasis... alive, healthy, just asleep.

719
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,980
有件事你说对了
You were right about one thing...

720
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,210
我是不想让你看到
I didn't want to show you.

721
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:04,840
不是因为我觉得我们做的不对
Not because I think what we're doing here is wrong.

722
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,390
而是因为我知道这看上去多糟
Because I know how it looks.

723
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:08,170
看上去像恐怖片
Looks like a horror movie.

724
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:09,710
尽量理解一下
Try to understand,

725
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:11,970
这些人转化后都深陷麻烦
these people were all in trouble after they turned.

726
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:14,510
有些人想自残  有些人伤了自己爱的人
Some tried hurting themselves. Some hurt loved ones.

727
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,450
是啊  他们有时很危险  我见识过
Yes, they can be dangerous. I've seen that.

728
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,090
但那也不能...
But it doesn't begin to just...

729
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:19,360
这东西就像一种疾病
This thing is like an illness.

730
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,090
但我们在寻找解药  而且就要找到了
But we're working on a cure, and we're close...

731
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:25,800
我们很快就能告诉他们  "你安全了
So close to telling those people, "You're safe.

732
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:27,200
你爱的人也都安全了
Your loved ones are safe.

733
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,590
你可以回家了"
You can go home."

734
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,810
这就像将人置于药物诱导性昏迷中
It's like putting someone in a medically induced coma

735
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:32,970
是为了让他们好起来
to make them better.

736
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,670
设想下为一个没有其他选择的人这么做
Imagine doing that for someone who has no other shot.

737
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,290
你失去了一个人
You lost someone.

738
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,080
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

739
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,970
我居然没看出来
I'm such an idiot for not seeing it.

740
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:50,070
对不起
I'm sorry.

741
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:54,290
铁杆棒球迷吧
Big baseball fan, I'm guessing.

742
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,070
我丈夫
My husband.

743
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,360
不是因为这个吧
Not to this.

744
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,360
不是
No.

745
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,620
不  那是多年前了
No, it was years ago.

746
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,980
在执行任务时吗
In the field?

747
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,150
不  这就是有趣的地方
No. That's the funny part.

748
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,540
我是出生入死的间谍
I was the spy taking risks.

749
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,570
他是个心脏病学家  老实人
He was a cardiologist, an honest man,

750
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,880
好丈夫  癌症很可恨
a good husband, and cancer sucks.

751
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:15,710
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

752
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:21,210
我愿付出一切  为他做这样的事
I would've given anything to do this for him.

753
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:23,930
让他睡一会儿
Just put him to sleep for a little while

754
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:25,540
直到有人能找到解药
until someone found a cure.

755
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:30,450
我能为他们这么做  为他们的家人
I can do that for those people, for their families.

756
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,140
老实说  我没想到
I got to be honest, I didn't expect...

757
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,230
什么
What?

758
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,430
我也是人吗
That I'm human?

759
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:38,140
我们可不都是人
Not all of us are.

760
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,350
不完全是人
Not fully.

761
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,020
我完全是
I am.

762
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,390
我觉得你也是的
And I think you are, too.

763
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,980
但如果你敢跟人说我说过这话
But if you tell anyone I said that,

764
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,610
我一定找到你的基地  炸成灰
I'll find your base and blow it up.

765
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,570
这一切让我很难保持自己的人性
I find it hard to keep my humanity in all of this.

766
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,480
一般来说  你得隔绝自己的感情
Usually, you have to cut yourself off from it.

767
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,220
我在尽量不那么做
I'm trying not to.

768
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:01,720
之前
Before...

769
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:05,670
你说你觉得我是想要你喜欢我
you said that you thought I wanted you to like me.

770
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,230
是啊  抱歉  那真是
Yeah. Sorry. That was...

771
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,680
但那部分或许
But that part might be a little...

772
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,010
没说错
true.

773
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,160
或许吧
Maybe.

774
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,960
很好
Good.

775
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,550
准备好了吗
Ready?

776
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:36,150
又是你  好啊
You again. Good.

777
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,460
好吧
All right.

778
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,160
开始了
Here we go.

779
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:29,210
斯特拉克
Strucker.

780
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,680
斯特拉克
Strucker.

781
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,840
沃德在哪
Where do I find Ward?

782
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,330
沃德
Ward...

783
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:36,560
不
No...

784
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,020
求你
Please...

785
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:51,260
我干掉过比你壮三倍的男人  丫头
I've taken down men three times your size, girl.

786
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:04,330
你凭什么觉得自己能打过我
What makes you think you can beat me?

787
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,240
经验
Experience.

788
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,330
我想完成沃德吩咐的任务
I tried to do what Ward wanted.

789
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:25,760
我想杀了他
I tried to kill him.

790
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,370
他  加纳教授吗
"Him"? Professor Garner.

791
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,710
我们都围住他了
We had him.

792
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:36,410
但我不知道他会变身
But I didn't know he'd change into that thing.

793
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,970
究竟是怎么回事
What really happened?

794
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,930
这不是真的
That's not true.

795
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,020
他是什么
What is he?

796
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:28,920
我不知道
I don't know.

797
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,980
《神盾局特工》马上回来
We'll return in a moment.

798
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,980
我说过  你不用担心我
I told you, you don't have to worry about me.

799
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,590
你还好吗  安全吗
Are you all right? Staying safe?

800
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,010
很安全
Safe as houses.

801
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:50,340
什么
What?

802
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,140
就是个说法而已
It's an expression. People say that.

803
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:56,970
好啊  等哪天跟我讲讲黑色风暴事件[30年代]
Sure. And someday, you can tell me how you survived the dust bowl

804
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:58,990
和胡佛政府的故事吧  老爷爷
and the Hoover administration, grandpa.

805
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,510
你嘴巴真刁  黛西
That's an ugly side of you, Daisy.

806
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:03,850
没办法  你懂规矩
That's too bad. You know the deal.

807
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,580
你说出你在哪  我就不取笑你了
I stop making fun of you when you tell me where you are.

808
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:07,800
好吧
Yeah.

809
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:11,830
低调一点  好吗
Just...Keep your head down, okay?

810
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,660
我不希望这东西找到你
I don't want this thing to find you.

811
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:16,290
你至少还有朋友可找吧
Do you have any friends out there, at least?

812
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,930
没有以前那么多了
Not as many as I used to.

813
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,850
这电话还能打多久就会被你追踪到
How much longer till the call is traceable?

814
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,580
15秒
15 seconds.

815
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,450
我会再联系你的
I'll reach out soon.

816
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,620
希望如此
Hope so.

817
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,260
加纳博士
Dr. Garner, hey.

818
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,640
是林肯吗
Was that Lincoln?

819
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:48,650
他有什么关于鞭笞的信息吗
He have anything to help us with Lash?

820
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,210
没有  又回到原地了
Nope. Back to square one.

821
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,180
别担心  你很快就能查明白的
Well, don't worry. You'll figure it out soon.

822
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,250
林肯说出自己的位置了吗
Hey, did Lincoln tell you where he is?

823
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,060
他在这里  有我们保护或许更安全
I mean, he'd be safer here, under our protection.

824
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,280
是啊  但他不信我  不肯说
I know, but he doesn't believe me. He won't tell me.

825
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,780
等他说了我会告诉你的
But I'll let you know when he does.

826
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:07,940
好啊
Great.
