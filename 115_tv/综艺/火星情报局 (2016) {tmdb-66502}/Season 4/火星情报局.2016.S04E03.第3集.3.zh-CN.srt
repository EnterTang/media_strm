There's no way they can get in.

354

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}你不是讨厌机器人吗
I thought you hated robots!

356
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:41,490
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}没错

357
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,180
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}安全了  这里完全密封  他们进不来
We're safe. It's hermetically sealed. They can't get in.

358
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,210

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}水会静静等待
Water just waits.

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}水能磨平悬崖
It wears down the clifftops,

361
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:05,030
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}夷平山峦  甚至整个世界
the mountains, the whole of the world.

362
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,080
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}水总是会赢  快来
Water always wins. Come on!

363
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,150

Make no contact.

And if they make a slightest move, tell me. I'm going to the Medical Dome.

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}我的天  这么远  都可以骑自行车了
Blimey, it's a distance. You could do with bikes in this place.

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}一磅载重就要消耗三吨燃油
Every pound in weight equals three tons of fuel.

369

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}可是  自行车啊

Has that door got a Hardinger seal?

372

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}没有  就是普通锁
No, just basic.

373
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,750
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}那她一扑到门上我们就撤  明白了吗
Then the moment she heads for the door, we evacuate. Got that?

374
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,720
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}脉搏很低
Pulse is low.

375
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,450
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}大脑电活动看起来一团乱
Electrical activity in the brain seems to be going haywire.

00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,840
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}-她能说话吗  -不知道
- Can she talk? - Don't know.

She was talking before we noticed the change, but...

Your commanding officer, Captain Adelaide Brooke.

380
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,850
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}你能告诉我是怎么回事吗
Can you tell me what happened?

381
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,610
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}-那是什么语  -上古北火星语
- What language is that? - Ancient North Martian.

382
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:11,940
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}别胡闹了
Don't be ridiculous.

383
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:15,090
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}-但她似乎听懂了  -而且她的眼睛变了
- It's like she recognised it. - And her eyes are different.

384

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}都变清澈了
They're clear,

385
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,490
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}就好像她更像人类
like she's closer to human.

386
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,870
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}我看离人类还差得远
Not close enough for me.

387
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:24,800
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}-你们的水是从哪里采的  -冰原
- Where do you get your water from? - The ice field.

388
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,070
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}所以我们才选择了这个环形山
That's why we chose the crater,

389
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,020
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}就在一片地下冰原上方
we're on top of an underground glacier.

390
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,690
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}丰富的水  真好
Tons of water. Marvellous.

391
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,750
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}但每一滴水都是过滤了的
But every single drop is filtered.

392
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:34,860
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}-经过滤筛  是安全的  -看来是挺安全
- It's screened, it's safe. - Looks like it, yeah.

393
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:39,190
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}如果冰层下冻着什么  某种病毒生命体
If something was frozen down there... A viral life form,

394
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:41,200
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}在冰块里被保存了这么久
held in the ice for all those years...

395
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,750
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}你看她的嘴  都黢黑开裂了
Look at her mouth. All blackened,

396
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,490
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}就好像是某种裂变
like there's some sort of fission.

397
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,070
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}这东西  不管是什么
This thing, whatever it is,

398
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:52,350
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}不止是藏在水里  还能产生水
doesn't just hide in water, it CREATES water.

399
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,530
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}告诉我你想要什么
Tell me what you want.

400
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,200
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}她之前看着屏幕
She was looking at the screen.

401
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,230
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}看着地球  她想要地球
At Earth. She wanted Earth.

402
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:04,840
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}一个充满水的世界
A world full of water.

403
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,450
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}船长  来一下
Captain. With me.

404
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,240
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}我很抱歉  但这是一种未知感染源
I'm sorry, but it's an unknown infection

405
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,340
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}而且还在扩散  这就需要启动一号程序
and it's spreading. That demands Action Procedure One.

406
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:19,020
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}-你以为我不知道吗  -我觉得你需要提醒
- D'you think I don't know that? - I think you need reminding.

407
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:22,740
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}也对
Yeah.

408
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,310
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}-至少我还是有点长处的  -偶尔吧
- Well, at least I'm good for something. - Now and again.

409
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,270
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}你这简直就是在夸我
That's almost a compliment.

410
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,560
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}看来事情真的很严重了
Things must be serious.

411
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:38,380
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}抱歉  一号程序是疏散的意思吧
Sorry, sorry, but... Action One, that means evacuation, yeah?

412
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,380
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}我们要回家了  我是布洛克船长
We're going home. This is Captain Brooke.

413
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,420
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}我宣布执行一号程序  重复  全体船员
I'm declaring Action One, repeat to all crewmembers,

414

this is Action One, with immediate effect. Evacuate the base.

415
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:49,260
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}我来储存中央电脑  米娅
I'll store the Central Computer, Mia,

strip the cargo down to essentials. Roman, on your feet!

417
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,600
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}-但我们走了这么远  -嘎吱嘎吱
- But we came all this way. - Gadget-gadget!

418
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,620
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}那你跟你的小机器人吻别吧
And you can kiss that robot goodbye,

419
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:59,630
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}太沉了  赶紧把它收拾进仓库  快点
it's too heavy. Now shove it in storage and hurry up!

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}需要飞行九个月
It's a nine-month flight,

422
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:05,700
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}至少需要三个小时才能装载完所需物资
it'll take three hours to load what we need.

423

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}给你20分钟  汇报下安迪和塔拉克的情况
You've got 20 minutes. And give me a report on Andy and Tarak.

424
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,150
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}他们还在生态圆舱的通道里
Still in the Bio-dome Tunnel.

425
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,860
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}就这么站着  好像在等什么
They're just standing there. Like they're waiting.

426
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:16,530
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}盯紧了他们  给你的时间减到15分钟
Keep an eye on them. And make that 20 minutes 15!

427
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,730
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}艾德  准备好飞船  直接进入发射状态
Ed, line up the shuttle, go straight to ignition status.

428
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:20,350
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}马上去
Doing it now.

429

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}-那玛吉呢  -她留下
- But what about Maggie? - She stays behind,

430
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,510
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}船上没地方关着她
we've got no way to contain her on board.

431
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:26,180
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}封闭这个区域  把电力直接转到飞船
Close this place down. I want the power directed to the shuttle.

432
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:29,000
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}-唯一的问题就是  -多谢你  博士
- Of course, the only problem is... - Thank you, Doctor,

your spacesuit will be returned. And good luck.

434
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,540
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}问题在于  这东西很聪明
The problem is, this thing is clever.

435
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,400
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}它不感染生态圆舱里的鸟类和昆虫
It didn't infect the birds or the insects in Bio-dome,

436
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,180
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}而是选择了人类  你们被盯上了
it chose the humans. You were chosen.

437
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,920
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}而我告诉你  阿德莱德  水等得起
And I told you, Adelaide, water can wait.

438
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,580
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}塔拉克立即就发作了
Tarak changed straight away,

439
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,190
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}但玛吉被感染后  它却隐藏在她体内
but when Maggie was infected it stayed hidden inside her.

440
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:47,260
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}毫无疑问是为了渗透中央圆舱  也就是说
No doubt, so it could infiltrate the Central Dome. Which means...

441
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,770
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}我们中间任何人都有可能被感染
Any one of us could already be infected.

442
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:52,070
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}我们都喝了同样的水
We've all been drinking the same water.

443
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,830
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}而如果你把这东西带回地球
And if you take that back to Earth...

444
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,870
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}-一滴  哪怕就一滴  -可是
- One drop. Just one drop. - But...

445
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,980
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}我们只是推测是感染
we're only presuming infection.

446
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:03,080
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}但如果我们能查明这东西是怎么进来的
If we can find out how this thing got through,

447
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,330
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}什么时候进来的
when it got through...

448
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:07,050
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}尤里  继续执行一号程序
Yuri, continue with Action One.

449
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,930
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}我要去检查冰原
I'm going to inspect the ice-field.

450

00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,340
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}我终于该走了
Finally, I should leave.

452
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:17,430
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}尤里好哥们  我完全没必要去看冰原的吧
Yuri, me old mate, no point in me seeing the ice-field.

453
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,910
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}完全没必要
No point at all.

454
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,510
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}没有
Nope.

455
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:26,180
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}阿德莱德
Adelaide!

456
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,370
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}我就说么  有自行车多好
All I'm saying is, bikes.

457
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:35,640
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}那种折叠的小自行车  不沉的
Little foldaway bikes, don't weigh a thing.

458
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:44,470
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}抱歉了
I'm sorry.

459
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,140
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}就算她穿过了医疗圆舱
Even if she gets past the Medical Dome,

460
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,870
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}她也绝对过不了这边的哈丁格锁  对吧
she'll never get past the Hardinger seal at this end, right?

461
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,480
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}只是我们说而已
So we keep saying.

462
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,570
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}摄像头坏了
Camera's down.

463
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:21,850
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}看不到她了
We've lost her.

464
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:55,370
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}人们很久以前就流传着火星的传说
They tell legends of Mars, from long ago.

465

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}他失去信号了

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}它  里面比...

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}你到底是谁

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}去照顾好她

Your daughter, and your daughter's daughter,

837
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:08,050
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}你又能见到她们了

838
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:11,080
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}一家团圆

839
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:12,680
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}但我应该死了
But I'm supposed to be dead.

840
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:14,440
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}不再是了
Not any more.

841
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:16,950
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}可是
But...

842
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:18,450
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}苏茜
Susie...

843
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,280
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}我的外孙女

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}可能永远不会存在了
might never exist now.

846

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}不会  阿德莱德船长可以亲自言传身教嘛
Nah! Captain Adelaide can inspire her face to face.

Different details, but the story's the same.

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}你怎么知道呢
You can't know that.

849
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:38,270
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}而如果我的家庭变了

851
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,700
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}甚至是整个人类的未来
the future of the human race.

852
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,970
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}谁都不该有那么大的权力
No-one should have that much power.

853
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:48,370
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}你还能怎样
Tough.

854
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:58,980
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}你应该把我们留在那里
You should have left us there.

855
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:02,130
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}阿德莱德  这种事我以前也做过
Adelaide, I've done this sort of thing before.

856
00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:05,010
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}使使小手段  救几个小人物
In small ways, saved some little people.

857

But never someone as important as you. Oh, I'm good!

858
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,160
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}小人物
Little people?

859
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:13,430
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}比如米娅和尤里吗
What, like Mia and Yuri?

860
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:16,380
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}谁判定他们就那么不重要  你吗
Who decides they're so unimportant? You?

861
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:18,200
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}一直以来
For a long time now,

862
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,390
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}我都以为我只是个幸存者  但我不是
I thought I was just a survivor, but I'm not.

863
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:23,480
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}我是赢家
I'm the winner.

864
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:25,580
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}那就是我

865
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:29,630
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}胜利的时间领主
The Time Lord Victorious.

866
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:36,150
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}就没人能阻止你了吗
And there's no-one to stop you?

867
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:37,830
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}没了
No.

868
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,960
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}这不对  博士
This is wrong, Doctor.

869
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:45,940
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}我不管你是谁  胜利的时间领主错了
I don't care who you are. The Time Lord Victorious is wrong.

870
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,450
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}这个我说了算
That's for me to decide.

871
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:52,630
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}你最好快回家吧
Now, you'd better get home.

872
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:56,540
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}门都锁了  毕竟你不在家嘛
Oh, it's all locked up, you've been away.

873
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:58,710
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}不过还是小菜一碟
Still, that's easy.

874
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:05,350
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}请吧
All yours.

875
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:09,690
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}还有你不能做的事吗
Is there nothing you can't do?

876
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:11,870
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}以后没有了
Not any more.

877
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:29,070
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}我不管你是谁
I don't care who you are.

878
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:31,740
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}胜利的时间领主错了
The Time Lord Victorious is wrong.

879
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:45,140
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}我做过头了
I've gone too far.

880
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:55,680
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}到时候了吗
Is this it?

881
00:59:58,170 --> 00:59:59,140
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}我的死亡
My death?

882
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:04,720
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}到时候了吗
Is it time?

883
01:00:45,790 --> 01:00:46,650
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}不
No.

884
01:00:56,840 --> 01:01:00,150
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}每一晚  博士  我们都噩梦不止
Every night, Doctor, we have bad dreams.

885
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:03,340
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}但有人告诉我  "他会敲四下"
But I was told, he will knock four times.

886
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:06,380
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}因为一个阴影笼罩了所有造物
Because a shadow is falling over creation.

887
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:09,200
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}神秘巨祸在黑暗中蠢动
Something vast is stirring in the dark.

888
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,300
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}我就要死了
I'm going to die.

889
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:18,380
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}我的名字  叫做法师
My name is the Master.

890
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:22,150
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}随黑暗而来的结局  只有一种
The darkness heralds only one thing...

891
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:26,030
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}时间的终结
The end of Time itself.
