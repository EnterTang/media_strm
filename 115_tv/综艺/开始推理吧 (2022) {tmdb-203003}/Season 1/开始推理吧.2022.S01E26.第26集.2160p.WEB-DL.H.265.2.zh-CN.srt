Really? He said flight risk?

I think Judge Ogden would disagree as well.

19
00:01:04,837 --> 00:01:07,818

Why? Because I took the man to Pebble Beach to golf,

×ÖÄ»
What's that?

56
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:44,483
×ÖÄ»
Trial separation usually means make an effort.

57

×ÖÄ»
nobody was there, but this was sitting there.

92
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,580
×ÖÄ»
And the next thing I know, it's like Fallujah.

93
00:05:35,581 --> 00:05:38,598
×ÖÄ»
At first, I thought it was a former client,

94
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:40,461
×ÖÄ»
someone who wasn't happy with me.

95

×ÖÄ»
No, I don't.

111

Wow, barrel's been smoothed out,
