- Is it time to get Leon yet? - Oh, checking.

41
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,790
试想一下被扣押两个星期
Imagine being detained for two weeks

42
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,870
就因为你是个记者和白痴
Just 'cause you're a journalist and a shithead.

43
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,330

- Yeah. - It's the one and only time anyone's ever gonna say that.

59
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,250
这一小时我们得干点什么事 对吗？
Let's use the hour, then, okay?

60
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,880
我们来治愈糖尿病 或者学会意大利语

That the American people need a president, not a Meyertollah?

96

这是一个很低级的外号 真的很希望……
It's a cheap pun, so absolutely expect...

97
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,110
- 这结尾的一句真是…… - 令人恼怒？ 是的
- That finishing sentences thing is... - Irritating? Very.

98
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,880
不过这在当人们迟缓蠢钝的时候非常必要
But sometimes necessary when people are being slow or dull.

99
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,880
- 请提问 - Mike什么时候回来？

我们接受吧 有人可能会因为这件事找他出书呢
Let's face it, he's probably gonna get a book deal out of this.

111
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,810
看到没有？ 猫一样的反应力
See that? Catlike reflexes.

112
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,830
哦 最好不要喝酒……
Oh, and maybe don't start drinking...

113
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,830
- 接着 - 等到飞机起飞再喝
- Heads up! - ...Till you're up in the air

114
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,280
出于对于东道国的礼貌

115

当然天主教也是
Also Catholicism.

121
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,100
事实上那才是主要的信仰
That's actually the main one.

122
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,050
哦 嗨 你们能弄到Freddy的亲笔签名吗？

先生 Freddy Wallace可能会用到LGBT这个词

B is for bisexual-- I couldn't think of one to go for that--

157
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,590
我要说几句
I'm gonna say a little something.

158
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,970
这最开始不是写给总统用的吗?

159
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,480

是我的男同朋友们

教会了我如何容忍他人

如何直面你自己
And how to be true to yourself

167
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,330
还有如何跟麦当娜跳舞
And how to dance to madonna.

168
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,470
- 麦当娜? - 什么鬼?

169
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,550
我是要说这个来着吗?
was I supposed to say that?

170
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,470
你造 在大学时 我的...

女朋友会--男朋友--我的朋友...

172
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,850
或许是该重新写写来着

173
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,080
德黑兰 纳沙德机场酒店

谢谢你的帮忙 Abbas

- 他是你朋友吗? - Leon吗? 噢 天哪 才不是
- Is he a friend of yours? - Leon? Oh, god, no.

177
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,310
他是傻逼中的战斗逼
He is the asshole of an asshole's asshole.

我对那些要带他走的兄弟们表示抱歉

两国都延期了这次会晤

00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,600
啊 他英语不是很好
Uh, his english isn't very good.

190
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,930
我还是能听得懂的
It sounded fine to me.

191
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,520
至于你 先生 准备好坐空军一号飞回家吧
And you, sir, get to fly home on air force one.

192
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,270
- 哇哦 - 是的
- Whoa. - Yeah.

193
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,190
我要是因为这个激动是不是太肤浅了
I'm shallow enough for that to be exciting.

194
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,970
你知道它连核爆炸都不怕吗?
Did you know it can survive a nuclear blast?

195
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,270
- 是啊 - 知道
- Yeah. - Yeah.

196
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,060
除非你的手下准备这么炸一下
Not that you guys are planning one.

197
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,700
我--无视我吧 我也不知道为啥我要说这个
I-- ignore me. I don't know why I said that.

198
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,280
他的英语也不是很好啊
His english isn't very good.

199
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,400
那么 我们走吧
well, let's get you going.

200
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:31,070
总统准备了一大杯加冰苏格兰威士忌给你
The president has a big-ass scotch on the rocks for you.

201
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,020
- 不错 - 其实就是加了冰的茶 冰茶
- Yeah. - Which is iced tea. It's iced tea.

202
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,460
- 谢谢你 Abbas - Mike
- Thank you, abbas. - Mike.

203
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,630

204
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,000
- 旅途安全 - 你留在这也要安全
- Safe trip. - Safe stay.

205
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:49,700
那么 让我们来庆祝一下我和我的团队所取得的成就
So let's celebrate all things l and gbt.

206
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,420
好吗?
Huh?

207
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,740
在LGBT基础上加上了queer(对自身性别不认同的人)

208
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,390
不过现在我们用了更具包容性的LGBTQ
Though these days we use the more inclusive lgbtq.

209
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,680
确实!
We do!

210
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,650
呃 我...
Um, and I...

211
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:06,520
尊重所有人做q的权利(其实他是不懂在胡扯)
Respect all people's rights to be a q.

212
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,360
或者不只是q
Or rather just q.

213
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,560
是啊 只是q
Yeah, just q.

214
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,830
他听起来像是在学习性别表一样
Sounds like he's learning a sex alphabet.

215
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,360
我曾见过北美灰熊嘴里的大马哈鱼
I've seen a salmon in a grizzly's mouth

216
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,030
都没有他这个恐怖啊
Look less panicky than that.

217
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,570
大家都知道q意味着有问题的
Everybody knows that q means questioning.

218
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:27,710
讽刺的是 直男们
Ironically, the straight guy

219
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,910
对同性恋们的认识十分僵化
Is very stiff around the gay guy.

220
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,430
我们的投票显示他更被广泛地认为成
Our polling said that he was widely perceived

221
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,420
老古板
As quite wooden.

222
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,470
你为什么要投票给他?
Why were you polling him?

223
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,850
我投给他是为了反对那些潜在的竞选对手
I was polling him against other potential running mates.

224
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:42,640
- 向后退! - 我可不是个倒着走的人 Amy
- Just move! - I'm not a backwards walker, amy.

225
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,690
总统向Doyle保证他会出现在选票上
The president promised doyle he'd be on the ticket

226
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,530
她不会投其他可能的竞选对手的票
And she wouldn't poll other possible running mates.

227
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,200
没人跟我说过这些
No one told me that.

228
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,240
又一次 左手完全不知道右手在干嘛
Yet again, the left hand has no idea what the right hand is doing

229
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,500
而畸形的第三只手
And the freakish middle

230
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,790
一下下打在我胸口上
hand is punching me repeatedly in the tits.

231
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,270
好吧 那是个教训
Well, that was an education.

232
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,210
我是说 我真正想做的是去政治游说
I mean, what I really want to do is get into lobbying.

233
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,480
不过已经过去了 大概
But it's only been, like,

234
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,910
四十五天 所以我再也不对它抱有幻想了
six weeks and three days, so I'm not sweating it.

235
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:08,130
哦 别挂 我有个电话进来
Oh, hold on. I got another call.

236
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:12,120
Sidney 嗨! 太好玩了
Sidney, hey! It's so funny.

237
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,010
我刚刚还在跟一个朋友说政治游说--
I was literally just commenting to a friend about lobb--

238
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,680
是 没错 一点也不好玩
Yeah, you're right, that's not interesting.

239
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,680
是的 我很想加入
Yes, I would love to come in.

240
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,010
所以这就是PKM
So this is pkm.

241
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:24,790
PKM - Sidney Purcell的办公室

242
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,850
这地方也太大了
This place is huge.

243
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,600
是啊 等你看到海豚馆再说
Yep. Wait till you see the dolphinarium.

244
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,930
就在拉丁部旁边
It's right near the latin quarter.

245
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,600
他还有一块了红灯区
And he's got the red-light district.

246
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,520
天哪 这地方太奇妙了
God, this place is so awesome.

247
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,910
我有点儿看上它了
I kind of feel like hitting on it.

248
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,940
好吧 这儿的女人你可以随便看 如果你想的话
Well, there's women here you can do that to if you wanted.

249
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,830
我注意到了 哦 那么 丹 这是我的筹码
I noticed. Oh. So, dan, here's my pitch.

250
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,160
我能让你变得富有
I can make you so rich,

251
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,820
富得能让比尔盖茨在你大腿上跳舞
you can pay bill gates to give you a lap dance.

252
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,250
让我听听你的筹码吧
Let me hear your pitch.

253

254
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,540
而且是被炒了的 对 别忘了你是被解雇的
And fired. Yeah, don't forget fired.

255
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,090
-之所以被炒 -哦 好吧

256
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,660
是为了让我的各种关系为你的客户服务
To put my contacts to work for your clients.

257
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,760
哦 这对我的钱包来讲就是妙音啊
Well, that's music to my wallet.

258
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,600
不过你准备好了在Mike Mclintock的门阶上拉屎吗？
But are you ready to take a dump on Mike McLintock's doorstep?

259
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,270
这是入帮仪式之类的吗？
Like an initiation kind of thing?

260
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,000
不是 我说的是 你能接受你的客户们
No, I mean, can you take on clients

261
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,350
都将会因为你捣乱Meyer总统的计划而受益吗？
who are best served by you shitting on the Meyer agenda?

262
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,860
哦 让我想想
Oh, well, let me think about that.

263
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:07,140
-好啊 当然了 -很好
- Yeah. Yeah. - Great.

264
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,640
我们过段时间再来谈这个门阶拉屎的事
We'll get to that doorstep thing later, though.

265
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,140
好啊 我还是想那么做的 我喜欢干这事
Yeah, I'll still do that. I'm into it.

266
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,850
女士 请允许我向您介绍这一小时的英雄
Ma'am, may I present the hero of the hour

267
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,150

along with yourself.

268
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,680
欢迎登上空军一号
Welcome aboard Air Force One.

269

好的 很好 是的
Okay. Great, yeah.

272
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,860

那么 很开心能见到你 Leon
Well, I am so happy to see you, Leon.

274
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,920
为了你能被释放 我们真的是很拼命啊
We really did work tirelessly for your release.

275
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,640
谢谢您 总统女士 这段时间我其实没怎么睡觉
Well, thank you, Madam President. I haven't slept very much.

276
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,720
哦 我很肯定食物是你脑子中所想的最后一样东西
Well, I'm sure food is the last thing on your mind.

277
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,090
我知道这是我想的最后一样东西
I know it's the last thing on my mind.

278
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,810
-我想知道你是不是饿了 -是的 我饿了
- I wonder if you're hungry, though. - Yes, I am.

279
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,560
因为我要告诉你 这次中东之旅
Because I'll tell you something, the adrenaline

280
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,100
身上产生的肾上腺素使我不需要吃任何东西
on this Mideast trip has just kept me from eating anything.

281
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,550
你刚刚是不是说你确实想吃点东西
Did you just say you do want something to eat?

282
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:48,600
-是的 谢谢 -是的
- Yes, thank you. - You do?

283
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,740
-哦 那是食物吗？-不是
- Oh, is that food? - No.

284
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,650
这 这是除臭剂
It's a... It's deodorant.

285
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,070
呃
Huh. Uh...

286
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,230
呃 好吧
Uh, all right.

287
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,690
你想吃点什么？
What would you like to eat?

288
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,560
除了鹰嘴豆 都可以
Anything that's not chickpeas.

289
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:08,200
嘿 为什么这两条可爱的长腿要从我身边走开？
Hey! Why are those lovely long legs walking away from me?

290
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,700
说的应该是你吧
Probably means you.

291
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,740
是的 没关系 我来搞定
Yeah, it's okay. I got... I got this.

292
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,460
我不是推卸责任 但是这次彩虹色的
I am not in the blame game, but that rainbow-colored

293
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,680
大灾难完全就是你的错
clusterfuck in there was entirely your fault.

294
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,960
喔 好的 不要 Kent Davison为其他副总统候选人做了民意调查
Whoa, okay, no. Kent Davison polled other candidates for veep.

295
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,220
搞什么？ 你刚才是想
What the fuck? Did you just

296
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,420
把Kent拉下水来救你自己吗？
throw Kent into the blender to save your own ass?

297
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,510
也不是完全拉下水
Not fully into the blender.

298
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,390
也许只是拉了一点点 就只是脚趾 因为……
Maybe just a little bit. Just the toe, 'cause...

299
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,420
这才是你到这儿后
That is the Jonah I've been

300
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,060
我一直试图唤醒的Jonah嘛
trying to wake up since the day you got here.

301
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:32,730
Kent Davison是个不忠诚的混球
And Kent Davison is a disloyal fucking prick.

302
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,150
我他妈可讨厌Kent了
I fucking hate Kent.

303
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,700
我特想把他脸上那副中立的表情抹掉
I want to wipe that neutral expression off his face.

304
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,200
我们这样做 好吧？
- Here's how we're gonna do it. - Okay.

305
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,820
我们泄漏出副总统现在很不满意
We're gonna leak that the VP is dissatisfied

306
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,290
他想退出的消息
and that he's thinking of walking.

307
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,160
我们要逼总统来支持Doyle
We're gonna force POTUS to back Doyle.

308
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,710
我不会让你失望的
I will not let you down.

309
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,290
好的 那么你在媒体里有哪些熟人？
All right, so what kind of media contacts do you have?

310
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,830
-Liz Kerrigan  -Liz吗？
- Liz Kerrigan. - Liz?

311
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,000
-Liz -你和这个Liz关系有多硬？
- Liz. - How hard can you work this Liz?

312
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,170
哦 天啊 硬到我可以把她操到汁水四溢
Oh, my God. I can ride her hard, hang her up wet.

313
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,550
我喜欢你现在的表现 好吧？
I like what I'm seeing, all right?

314
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,090
-多多展现自己啊 -谢谢 我会的
- Show me more. - Thank you, I will.

315
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,420
-在这下面放两个桶 -噢!
- Give 'em both barrels. - Oh!

316
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,670
简直是他妈的噩梦
Fucking nightmare.

317
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,680
这真是一段不可思议的时光
It's just been such a magical time.

318
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,230
我真希望我能够访问世界上每个国家
And I wish I could have visited every country in the whole world.

319
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,310
你知道吗？ 连新西兰我都想去
You know? Even New Zealand.

320
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,680
听说人们现在都把我和尼克松比较 对吗？
People are now comparing me to Nixon, I heard, right?

321
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,600
-他们不是说的你的样貌 -不 不 不 我也不是说外貌
- They didn't mean your looks. - No, no, no, I don't mean that.

322
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,490
但是 我接受这种比较
But, I mean, I'll take the comparison.

323
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,990
那么 我们从哪儿谈起呢？
So where would you like to begin?

324
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,990
嗯 我也不太清楚最近都发生了什么
Well, I don't really know what's happened lately

325
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,360
因为我被锁在
because I've been locked in a

326
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,530
酒店房间 与外界隔绝里
hotel room without access to the outside world.

327
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,830
当然 你知道我们需要做什么吗？
Of course. You know what we need to do?

328
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,250
我们需要给Leon拿些剪报
We need to get Leon some of the press clippings.

329
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,750
我想他会想看看的
I think he'd like to see some of those.

330
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,120
-是不是得先看看他的食物准备好了没有 -是的
- Should I check on his food first? - Yes.

331
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,780
-不 不 给他拿剪报 -好的
- No, no, get him the press clippings. - Yeah.

332
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,000
首先 和以色列的会谈进展的非常棒
First of all, the talks in Israel went so well

333
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,420
以至于我把到这儿的时间推迟了一天
that I was delayed a day getting here.

334
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,430
然后 这边的会谈也非常棒
And then the talks here were just amazing.

335
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,630
我想弄清楚 您推迟了一天到这儿
So, just to clarify, you were delayed by a day.

336
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,000

剪报在这里
Here's those press clippings.

339
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,390
我想让你做的是去看看Leon的食物准备好了没有
What I would like you to do is check on Leon's food.

340
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,840
-因为我知道你饥肠辘辘了 -好的
- 'Cause I know you're hungry. - Yeah.

-Mike Mike 我是Mike -Mike Mike
- Mike. Mike. It's Mike. - Mike. Mike.

343
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,310
副总统那边有麻烦了
We got a problem with the vice president.

344
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,150

345
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,650
-我不知道发生了什么 -当然
- I don't know what this is all about. - Sure.

346
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,320
-什么事？ -女士 Liz Kerrigan
- What's going on? - Ma'am, Liz Kerrigan

347
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,200
发表了一篇报道说Doyle有不满
is running a story that Doyle is unhappy.

348
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,530
我要不要去看看
Should I go and see if there's

349
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,320
媒体专机上有没有关于这事的闲言？
any chatter about this on the press plane?

350
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,380
老天 还是数据泄漏的原因
Christ, it's that data fuck.

351
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,050
不是 我也不知道 是
No. I don't know. Yes.

352
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,360
就当作我不知道吧
Let's just go with I don't know.

353
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,880
行了 都别往那边看 Leon在看着呢
Okay, please nobody look, but Leon's watching.

354
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,750
好吧 那么你进去 分散他的注意力
Okay, so just go in there and distract him.

355
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,530
必要的话你给他撸一下
Give him a handjob if you have to,

356
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,300
把这事解决了 好吗？
just get it done, okay?

357
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,920
哇 被扣押了两周

00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,340
-我一直在酒店 所以也不是那么糟 -哦 不
- I was in a hotel, so it wasn't that bad. - Oh, no.

360
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,400
Leon开始认为他被推迟一天释放
Leon is starting to think that his release was delayed by a day

361
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,400
是因为我到这儿推迟了一天
because my arrival here was delayed by a day.

362
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,940
他会想明白 是我们直到现在才同意他被释放
He's gonna figure out that we didn't okay his release till now

363
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,520
然后就这件事他会写些不好的报道
and then he'll write something bad about that.

364
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,720
-那就糟了 -是的
- That could be bad. - Yeah.

365
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,070
-现在情况也很糟糕 -是很糟糕了
- That is bad. - It is bad.

366
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,860
Leon想说点什么坏话
And Leon wanting to say it's bad

367
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,110
真的很糟糕 是更糟糕

368
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,660
好吧 听着 Ben 七秒钟后 你进去
Okay, look, in seven seconds, you come in there, Ben,

369
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,780
你抓住我的头发把我拽出来
you grab me by the hair and you drag me out,

370
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,920
行吗？ 你在听吗？

371
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,330
-在听 -好的
-  Yeah. - Okay.

372
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:55,700
我们得查出来这个Doyle的报道是从哪儿来的
We got to find out where this Doyle story is coming from.

373
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,540
我去媒体专机打听打听
I'll check out the press plane.

374
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,740
你一定很累了
You must be very tired.

375
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,240
你需要休息一下吗?
Would you like to put a pin in this for a moment?

376
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,130
一些人可能会认为美国政府
Some people might think that the american government

377
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,050
扣留了一个美国记者
Detaining an american journalist

378
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,210
这样就有可能出现一些影响不好的照片
So that you can have a photo op might look bad.

379
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,880
你明白吗?
Can you see that?

380
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,600
-Leon 我尊重你这样的记者 -谢谢
- Leon, I respect you so much as a journalist. - Thank you.

381
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,770
当Ben和我首次讨论和平会谈时
And when ben and I were first discussing the peace talks,

382
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,030
我和他说:"Ben Ben 我"
I said to ben, I said, "Ben. Ben, I--"

383
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,430
女士 是国务部
Ma'am, state department.

384
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,070
我必须接这个电话 不好意思 你好? 从不消停 对吧?
This I've got to take. Excuse me. Hello? Never stops, does it?

385
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,900
-Leon 你需要休息 -嗯
- Leon, you need to rest. - Mm-hmm.

386
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:29,120
我只打了个盹 但我感觉自己棒棒哒
I just had one second of sleep and I feel great.

387
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,830
好 媒体专机上的人们
Okay, maybe the guys in the

可能更希望我到那去

389
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:37,210
告诉他们 美国政府在伊朗关押了一个记者
And tell them about the us government imprisoning a guy in iran.

390
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,130
去媒体专机上把Mike找来
Go get mike from the press plane.

391
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,080

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,580
我们得把他当作人质
We've got to hold him hostage here.

393
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,300
你明白吗? 我们要起飞了
Do you understand? We've got to take off now.

394
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,800
Mike和Gary都不在飞机上
Mike and gary are off the plane.

395
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,290
我们机上有飞行员对吧?
We have a pilot on the plane, right?

396
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,170
好 那我们走吧 我们得出发了
Okay, so let's go. We've got to go.

Leon 你得坐下了
Leon, you've got to sit down.

398
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,260
我晕机的 我需要人抱抱
I'm a bad flier and I might need somebody to hold me.

399
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,350
你这是要再次扣留我吗?
Are you seriously detaining me again?

400
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,600
我是被抛弃了么?
Am I being rendered?

401
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,100
不 你被拉到我方阵营了
No, you're being friendered.

402
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:03,100
所以你不接收 也得接收我们的热情好客
So just please accept our compulsory hospitality.

我的妈 你就像个中学老师

好吧 那是Erica
Okay, that's erica. She's

406

她会带你出去买几件像样的衣服
gonna take you out and buy you some real suits.

407
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,080
而不是你穿的这些政府职员套装
Not these government-issued rags you're wearing.

408
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,750
她不是政府职员 对吧?
She's not exactly government-issue herself, is she?

409
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:20,000
-对 嘿 别想打她主意 -哦
- Yeah. Hey, don't even look at her. - Oh.

410
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,790
开玩笑啦 我在开玩笑吗?
I'm kidding. Or am I?

411
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,760
哈? 不 确切说 我是在开玩笑啦 Dan
Huh? No, seriously, I'm just fucking with you, dan.

412

会让你以一个政治评论员的形象上电视
gonna put you on tv as a political commentator.

414
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,880
-好! -呃?
-Yes! - Yeah?

415
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,380
电视上终于有点好看的节目了
Finally, something good to watch on the idiot box.

416
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,690
我们刚开始进行糖衣樱桃的游说活动
We've just started lobbying for glace cherries,

417
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,110
所以你要提下糖衣樱桃
So mention glace cherries.

418
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,170
好吧 我怎样才能在政治圆桌中
Well, how do I work in

419
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,230
强行插入糖衣樱桃呢?
glace cherries into a political roundtable?

420
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,840
车到山前必有路 听着 如果你帮我弄到糖衣樱桃
You'll figure it out. Listen, you give me glace cherries,

421
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,700
我会给你一床的钞票和妹纸
And I'll give you a bed of money with pussy on the nightstand.

422
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,730
也许能帮你弄到Erica 但不是刚刚那个
Maybe erica. But not her.

423
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,850
不 但也有可能
No. But maybe.

424
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,900
我们就留点悬念吧
we'll just let that hang.

425
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,860
对 我知道 随时待命哦 兄弟
Yeah, yeah. I know. Stay on your toes, buddy.

426
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,580
就像你一直在这里一样
It's gonna be like that the entire time you're here.

427
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,720
看 那是空军一号
Hey, that's air force one.

428
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,340
我的妈 发生什么事了?
Oh, my god. What the hell is happening?

429
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,810
为什么我们被落在这里? 开始打仗了吗?
Why are they leaving us? Are we at war?

430
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,970
在这里开战? 天啊 不 这不可能 不可能
Is it here? Sweet jesus. No, it can't be. It can't be.

431
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:16,390
-耶稣 -别说耶稣了 闭嘴
-Oh, sweet jesus. - Stop saying jesus. Stop it!

432
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,010
我是这么想的
This is how I see it.

433
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:20,430
美国政府在计划一次秘密访问
I say the us is planning a secret trip.

434
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,350
伊方要求你们承认这次秘密访问
The iranians ask you to confirm the secret trip.

435
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,150
你否认了秘密访问 因为这是个机密
You say there's no secret trip because it's a secret.

436
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:29,440
他们以为我是007 于是就扣押了我
They think I'm james bond and detain me.

437
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:32,690
Leon 你他喵的才不是007
Leon, you're no fucking james bond.

438
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,610
记者都爱编故事
Journalism is storytelling.

439
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,500
你说的是关于的你的勇气 正直
You tell your story about your bravery, your integrity

440
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,920
以及我们如何营救你 给你温暖的故事
And how we rescued you and gave you warm nuts.

441
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,090
伊方是因为你才扣押我的
The iranians detained me because of you.

442
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,710
这就是我的故事
That's my story.

443
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,710
就因为你我被多扣留了一天
They detained me an extra day because of you.

444
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,080
这是我另一个故事
That's my other story.

445
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,100
你这个不知好歹的杂种 还想被救吗?
Now, you want to be rescued or not, you ungrateful shit?

446
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:53,080
因为总统想凭释放一个美国人上头条
My release was delayed because the president

447
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,580
我就被延迟释放了
Wanted to grab the headlines for freeing an american,

448
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,190
所以她不是故意不释放这个美国人
An american she deliberately did not de-detain.

449
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,310
Jonah 要么把Leon的妈妈喊来空军基地
Jonah, either get leon's mom to the air base

450
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,360
要么就给你自己买个像样点的假发
Or buy yourself a very convincing wig.

451
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,360
-Kent呢? -我母鸡啊
- Where's kent? - I don't know.

452
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,950
可能他关掉了自己的追踪器
Maybe he's bitten off his tracking device.

453
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,860
他现在应该到了才对 这不对劲啊
He should be here by now. This is not okay.

454
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,150
-Mike -Sue 把黄丝带弄断
- Mike. - Break out the yellow ribbon, sue.

我们滞留在伊朗了 Sue 我好怕怕
We are stranded in iran. I'm really scared, sue.

456
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,440
Gary 拿出点男子汉气概 别那么娘
Man up, gary. Or at least lady down a bit.

457
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,910
Gary和Mike被落在伊朗了
Gary and mike have been left behind in iran.

458
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,130
棒极了 简直是搞笑版的黑鹰堕落
Wonderful. It's "Black hawk down" With laurel and hardy.

459
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,630
Amy 如果被问起 别说有人落在伊朗
Amy, if anyone asks, no one's been left behind in iran.

460
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,830
你来了 你刚去哪了?
There you are. Where have you been?

461
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,450
我等你等到胡子都长出来了
I grew a small beard here.

462
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:32,950
Bill 我已经从慢慢走到快步走了
Bill, of my various walking paces, I selected moderate to fast.

463
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,290
媒体都说副总统对总统不满
The press are saying that the vp is unhappy with the president.

464
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,680
-这可不妙 -是因为地下民意调查吗?
- That doesn't make me happy. - Because of the secret polling?

465
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:38,810
还是因为他听说
Or because he's heard that

466
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,680
有人黑了去世孩童的资料?
someone has hacked the data of dead children?

467
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,300
或者还有更糟糕的原因?
Or a third reason which is even worse than those?

468
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,230
我们只好钻进Doyle脑袋里 看看他知道什么
We've got to get inside doyle's head, find out what he knows.

彼此彼此

00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,480
直播的时候 我们就不能对彼此这么友善了
Can't be this nice to each other on air, you know.

488
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,060

00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:40,050
他紧握住我的蛋蛋相当久的一段时间
He held my testicles for a significantly long time.

518
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,600
猜怎么着 我刚订婚了
Guess what. I just got engaged.

519
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,770
你他妈的在逗我?Catherine也在那？
Are you fucking kidding me? Catherine's there, too?

520
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,590
嗨 jonah Jason向我求婚 我同意了
Hi, jonah. Jason proposed and I said yes.

521
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,590
好吧 妈蛋 祝贺你
Well, shit, congratulations.

522
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:51,980
婚姻是美好的 这是个很好的制度
Marriage is good. It's a fine institution.

523
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:54,400
别告诉我妈妈 我要给她个惊喜
Don't tell my mom. I want to surprise her.

524
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,030
Jonah 你还有啥想告诉我们的吗?
Jonah, is there anything else you want to tell us?

525
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,930
我不知道 屋子里还有谁？
I don't know. Is there anybody else in the room?

526
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,650
只有我和Bill了
Just myself and bill again.

527
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,240
还有我在做记录 Sue也在?！艹！
And I'm here taking notes. Sue's there?! Fuck!

528
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:07,040
好了 够了 不 我没啥可说的了
Okay, well, no. There's nothing else that I have to say.

529
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,050
我很确信我是
I'm pretty sure that I'm

530
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,910
唯一一个被teddy摸过的人 行了吧？
the only one that teddy's been touching, okay?

531
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,160
多谢了 朋友们 聊得真愉快
Thanks, guys. Great talk.

532
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,500
好了 我们除了这好笑的故事啥也没打听到
Okay, we got nothing out of that but a funny story.

533
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:17,250
飞机坏了 我们不能起飞
Plane's broken. We can't take off.

534
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,340
他们说还需要一周才能修好
They said it's gonna be a week until they get the part.

535
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,970
天了噜 人家大天朝子民能在一周内
Jesus christ, the chinese can 3-d print

536
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,590
用3d打印出一百栋房子!尼玛!
A hundred houses in that time. Fuck!

537
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,560
Mike 你说为啥不给备用飞机再准备个备用飞机?
Why isn't there a backup plane for the backup plane, mike?

538
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,230
我们得去坐媒体专用飞机
We need to get on the press plane.

539
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,790
媒体们恨咱们 尤其你
The press hates us, especially you.

540
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,980
他们受不了你 Gary 我们有酒
They can't stand you. We have booze, gary.

541
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,470
他们对酒没有抵抗力
And they have a crippling dependency.

542
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,320
啥 这能行吗?在一个干燥的国家
What, is this gonna work? In a dry country,

543
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:37,400
有酒的人说了算
The man with all the booze holds the cards.

544
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,440
什么事?
yeah?

545
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,580
夫人 真的有电话找你
Ma'am, you actually do have a phone call.

546
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,500
哦 是kent和bill 开了免提
Oh. It's kent and bill on speaker.

547
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:46,150
嘿 同志们 啥事?
Hey, guys, what's up?

548
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,420
夫人 我们担心Doyle可能知道投票的事了
Ma'am, we're worried that doyle knows about the polling.

549
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,670
什么投票?Kent
What polling? Kent.

550
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,870
我认为有必要观察一下
I thought it might be

551
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:54,420
Doyle作为副总统是怎么表现的
useful to see how doyle is performing as veep.

552
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:58,660
我特意向Doyle保证不会那么做 Kent
I specifically promised doyle that I would not do that, kent.

553
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,880
抱歉 但这确实带来了有趣的结果
I apologize. But it did throw up some very interesting results.

554
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:05,600
但我还是等你没那么生气的时候再告诉你
But I will run those by you at a less angry time.

555
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,970
我们想了一个自认为很机智的计划
We have what we think is a very smart plan of action.

556
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,550
挺牛逼的 相当牛逼
It's brilliant. Quite brilliant.

557
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,310
我们告诉Doyle你的竞选活动
We tell doyle that your campaign

558
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,520
利用丢失的数据筛选出丧子的父母作为目标
Used stolen data to target bereaved parents.

559
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,640
你他妈到底为啥要
Why in the name of pixelated fuck

560
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,730
这么做?我的神呐！
Would you do that? My god!

561
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,620
还有说这事的时候你能不能用暗号?
And can you please use code when we're talking about this?

562
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:25,450
用个什么词 比如说 用 纸杯蛋糕 代替 数据
Use the word, I don't know, cupcake instead of data

563
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:29,040
用 幸福 代替 丧子 之类的
And use happy instead of bereaved or something.

564
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,330
这样做能把他拉来我们这边 影响他
It binds him to us. Infects him.

565
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,600
而且他办公室那边
And elements of his office

566
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,660
被抄送了提到违规的邮件
were cc'd on e-mails mentioning the breach.

567
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,330
没错 这起盗用去世孩子的蛋糕事件后
Exactly, he will be as involved as the rest of us

568
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:40,670
他会和我们其他人一样
In targeting happy parents after stealing cupcakes

569
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,170
被卷入幸福父母的筛选事件
About their dead children.

570
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,720
好吧
fine.

571
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,590
向他注入幸福小蛋糕病毒 好吧?
Inject him with the happy cupcake virus, all right?

572
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,430
希望他变肿大然后挂掉
I hope he swells up and dies.

573
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,480
顺便说一句 这不是暗语
That's not code, by the way.

574
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,010
哇 ben 我为啥不知道这里发生了什么?
Wow. Ben, why don't I know what's going on here?

575
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:56,980
我不知道 我本该是掌握大权按钮的
I don't know. I'm supposed to have my finger on the button.

576
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,490
但目前看来 按钮的电线换了新接头
But for all I know, it's been rewired

577
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,890
我现在只能在某个柜子的小角落里控制什么小灯泡
And I'm just operating some sort of light in a closet somewhere.

578
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,860
我们要把Leon怎么处置?
And what are we gonna do about leon?

579
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,830
我要对他像亲哥哥一样
I'm gonna treat him like my own brother, ahem,

580
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,660
那个哥哥在86年被我杀掉了
Who I had murdered back in '86.

581
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,420
总统在中东很受欢迎
The president is charming the middle east.

582
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:16,090
但显然她的副总统对她不满意?
But apparently her own vp is unhappy with her?

583
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,740
假的 难道我们要讨论谣言了吗?
Not true. And we're discussing rumors?

584
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,260
这是新闻台还是寝室卧谈会?
Is this a news channel or a dorm room?

585
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:24,180
你可以认为总统的伊朗行
You could say that the president's iran visit

586
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,710
是把一个美味的糖衣樱桃
Puts a delicious glace

587
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:28,430
放在了selina meyer之旅的蛋糕上
cherry on the cake of selina meyer's tour.

588
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:31,220
嗯 欢迎从荒原回来
Well, welcome back from the wasteland.

589
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,470
为咱俩干杯 为你漂亮的完成任务干杯
Here's to us. To a job well done on your part.

590
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,220
你很棒 当然 我知道
You were great. Yeah, I know.

591
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,390
你知道么 我们依旧可以做得很棒
You know, we could still be great.

592
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,390
我们能吗?
We could?

593
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,810
哦 是
Oh, yeah.

594
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,930
能问你个问题吗?问吧
Can I ask you something? Uh-oh.

595
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,290
我那么容易被看透吗?真的吗？
Am I that transparent? Really?

596
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,120
Dan 你确实有点
Dan, you kind of are.

597
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,460
好吧 Amy
Well, amy,

598
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:57,040
如果你能让我进白宫
I would love it if you would give me

599
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,330
我会很开心的
Access to the white house.

600
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,550
哦
Oh.

601
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,890
什么?
What?

602
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,500
你以为我要问别的事?
You think I was gonna ask you something else?

603
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,760
不 好的
No. Okay.

604
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,680
喂? Amy 噩耗
Yeah? Amy, bad news.

605
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:17,730
Ericsson 告诉Doyle我们竞选利用了
Ericsson told doyle that the campaign used

606
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:20,520
死掉的孩子的数据来筛选最近丧子的父母选民
Dead kids' data to target recently bereaved parents.

607
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:23,600
天了噜 这简直是蓄意自我破坏行为
God, that is some elaborate self-sabotage right there.

608
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,320
是太阳马戏团的自杀式炸弹袭击
That is cirque du soleil suicide bombing.

609
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,860
坐时光机回去 阻止这件事发生
Go back in time and stop that from happening.

610
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,530
你没事吧?
You okay?

611
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,650
感觉我像是在靠呼吸机维持生命
I feel like I'm on a life-support machine

612
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:36,780
然后他们不停地拔插销下来 给手机充电
And they keep pulling the plug to charge their phones.

613
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,290
要龙舌兰么?好啊
Tequila? Yeah.

614
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,660
- 妈妈咪呀 太吓人了 - 冷静点 Gary
-My god, this is so scary. -Quiet down, Gary.

615
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,320
- 我就是受到了惊吓嘛 - 赶紧的 给我冷静点儿--
-It's just really scary. -Hurry up and be quiet--

616
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,660
- 哦 天哪 - 哦 你在逗我吗
-oh, my god. -Oh, you're kidding.

617
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,540
- 神啊 哦 上帝 - 快捡起来!
-Jesus. Oh, my god. -Pick them up!

618
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,300
我可不想在这儿蹲监狱
I don't want to go to jail over here.

619
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:51,010
我们现在只有大概10秒钟的时间 不仅要全喝掉这些
We've got about 10 seconds to drink everything

620
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,500
还要吃掉这些瓶子
And then eat the bottles.

621
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,440
你要见我 夫人?
You wanted to see me, ma'am?

622
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,970
哦 我打扰到你休息了?
Oh, did I wake you up?

623
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,640
呃 没有
Um, no.

624
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,170
进来 进来 赶紧的
Come in. Come in, come in.

625
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,110
伙计 你脸色不大好呀
You don't look good, man.

626
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,900
你看起来就像是机舱失了压
You look like the cabin depressurized

627
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,360
你马上就要昏迷了似的
And you fell into a coma or something.

628
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,400
- 不 我--我很好 - 坐吧 坐下
-No, I'm-- I'm fine. -Sit. Sit.

629
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,870
所以...
so...

630
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,350
有什么事儿啊 夫人?
What's up, ma'am?

631
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:14,710
我现在掌控不了局势了 Ben 我真的很无力
I'm not in control, Ben. I'm really not.

632
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,320
- 怕啥 我们有专门的飞行员 - 你知道我在说什么
-Well, we have pilots for that. -You know what I mean.

633
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,740
Leon  Kent的投票
Leon, Kent's polling,

634
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,500
烤在杯蛋糕里的死去的孩子
Dead kids baked in the cupcakes.

635
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:24,030
所有的这些都让我坚信
So all of this has confirmed for me

636
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,670
我做出拉点新人进来的决定
That I made the right decision

637
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,920
是正确的
When I decided to bring in somebody else.

638
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:30,700
那太棒了 众人拾柴火焰高嘛
That's great. More minds the merrier.

639
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,390
好像是有这么一句话吧 我猜的
That's a saying, I think.

640
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:35,760
并没有 她的名字是 Karen Collins
No, I don't think it is. Her name is Karen Collins.

641
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:38,010
好咩? 想想我那些当律师的旧时光 你可能会记起来她
Okay? You might remember her from my old lawyering days.

642
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,980
不 我是说 我很认真的哦 Ben
No. I mean, seriously, Ben,

643
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,600
她拥有我求之不得的一切
She's everything that I'm missing.

644
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:44,850
她聪慧 有才干 做事有条有理
She's smart, she's capable, she's organized.

645
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,690
她听起来就像是...
She sounds like the...

646
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,660
全能工具包
Complete package.

647
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,080
