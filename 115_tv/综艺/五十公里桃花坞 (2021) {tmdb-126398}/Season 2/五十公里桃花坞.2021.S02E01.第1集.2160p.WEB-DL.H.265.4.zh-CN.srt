00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,220
我说了我会说  该死的
{\fs10\b0}Yeah, I said I'll do it. Goddamn it.{\r}

120
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,960
要我扶你起来吗  不用  不用  我没事
{\fs10\b0}- You want me to help you up? - No, no, I'll be fine.{\r}

121
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,610
就想一个人静一会儿
{\fs10\b0}Just want to sit here by myself for a minute.{\r}

122
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,100
亲爱的  这是内森
{\fs10\b0}Honey, this is Nathan.{\r}

123
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,280
他是石油和天然气律师
{\fs10\b0}He's an oil and gas attorney.{\r}

124
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,460
另一个室友是戴尔
{\fs10\b0}My other roommate is Dale.{\r}

125
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,940
他是所谓的石油工程师
{\fs10\b0}He's what they call a petroleum engineer.{\r}

126
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,500
现在正在楼上  角膜破裂
{\fs10\b0}He's the one upstairs right now with a ruptured cornea{\r}

127
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,640
还有医生说的心肌梗塞
{\fs10\b0}and what doctors call a myocardial infarction.{\r}

128
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,680
普通人管这叫心脏病发作
{\fs10\b0}Regular folks call that a heart attack,{\r}

129
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,510
就是你戳瞎他眼睛时给他造成的
{\fs10\b0}which is what you gave him when you poked his fucking eye out.{\r}

130
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,730
所以为了避免再次发生混乱
{\fs10\b0}So I tell you what, just to prevent further confusion,{\r}

131
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,040
咱们都同意进浴室时
{\fs10\b0}what do you say we all lock the bathroom door{\r}

132
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,040
锁上门如何
{\fs10\b0}when we're in it?{\r}

133
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,430
不用说第二遍
{\fs10\b0}Don't got to tell me twice.{\r}

134
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,740
我的浴室在楼下
{\fs10\b0}My bathroom's downstairs.{\r}

135
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,910
我想不出任何理由  内特
{\fs10\b0}- I can't come up with a reason-- -  Nate,{\r}

136
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,610
把该死的门锁上行吗
{\fs10\b0}just lock the fucking door, will you?{\r}

137
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,000
这样就不用想理由了
{\fs10\b0}Then we don't have to worry about reasons.{\r}

138
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,480
不会再有这种事了
{\fs10\b0}There won't be one.{\r}

139
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,620
太好了  我的一天开始了
{\fs10\b0}Oh, goodie. My day begins.{\r}

140
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,580
是
{\fs10\b0}Yeah.{\r}

141
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,880
你在路上了吗
{\fs10\b0}You on your way?{\r}

142
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,190
在路上去哪儿
{\fs10\b0}On my way where?{\r}

143
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,670
你不知道
{\fs10\b0}You don't know?{\r}

144
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,190
我当然不知道  沃尔特  到底是什么事
{\fs10\b0}Well, clearly not, Walt. What do I not fucking know?{\r}

145
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,720
伙计  你们那边出井喷了
{\fs10\b0}Buddy, y'all had a blowout.{\r}

146
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,720
天呐  迈克
{\fs10\b0}Jesus, Mike,{\r}

147
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:38,980
我是在给你
{\fs10\b0}you're acting like I'm not trying to give you{\r}

148
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
价值两千二百万的生意
{\fs10\b0}$22 million dollars' worth of business.{\r}

149
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,900
看在老天的份上  能不能在价格上商量一下
{\fs10\b0}For fuck's sake, can you work with me on the price?{\r}

150
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,860
该死  我买一打甜甜圈
{\fs10\b0}Goddamn it, I buy a dozen doughnuts,{\r}

151
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,820
都能多送一个
{\fs10\b0}someone throws one in for free.{\r}

152
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,770
我提醒你  你又不是这个州
{\fs10\b0}Need I remind you, you are not the only person{\r}

153
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,300
唯一一个卖中空钢管的人
{\fs10\b0}selling hollowed-out steel in this fucking state?{\r}

154
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:53,910
谢谢
{\fs10\b0}Thank you.{\r}

155
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,220
天呐  喂
{\fs10\b0}Christ. Hey.{\r}

156
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,220
谢泼德-黑斯廷斯派律师来了
{\fs10\b0}Shepherd-Hastings is sending an attorney out.{\r}

157
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,870
他们的飞机中午到  你能去接一下吗
{\fs10\b0}Their plane lands at noon. Can you pick him up?{\r}

158
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,130
长官  我们这边出井喷了
{\fs10\b0}Sir, we've had a blowout.{\r}

159

162
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,970

{\fs10\b0}I don't know, I'm en route.{\r}

163
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,110
让律师自己租车吧
{\fs10\b0}Just tell the attorney to get a rental car.{\r}

164
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,240
房子里还有空房间吗
{\fs10\b0}All right, is-is there room at the house,{\r}

165
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,200
还是要帮他们订酒店

{\fs10\b0}Now I want to go to the hospital.{\r}

222
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,480

{\fs10\b0}I'm not sure...{\r}

232
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:02,140
就要辆不起眼的
{\fs10\b0}Something that doesn't stand out.{\r}

233
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,270

238
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,470
我猜到了  你看看他
{\fs10\b0}I mean, I assumed. Look at this kid.{\r}

239
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,690
要是他们分手了  我可能会上他
{\fs10\b0}If they ever break up, I might try to fuck him.{\r}

240
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,510
那你今天运气不错
{\fs10\b0}Well, today's your lucky day, then.{\r}

241
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,470
天呐  他们分手了吗
{\fs10\b0}Oh, no, they broke up?{\r}

242
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,470
为什么  因为他果然
{\fs10\b0}- Why? - Well, because he turned out{\r}

243
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,040
就是我们想的那种人
{\fs10\b0}to be exactly what we thought he was.{\r}

244
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,910
她怎么样
{\fs10\b0}How's she taking it?{\r}

245
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,480
就像个17岁的小孩
{\fs10\b0}Like a 17-year-old{\r}

246
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,440
从8岁起就没人管过她
{\fs10\b0}who hasn't heard no since she was eight.{\r}

247
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:45,660
可怜的孩子
{\fs10\b0}Poor thing.{\r}

248
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,270
听着  今天钻井平台出事了
{\fs10\b0}So, listen, uh, there was an accident out today{\r}

249
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,450
库珀受伤了
{\fs10\b0}on one of the rigs, and, uh,{\r}

250
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,540
伤得重吗
{\fs10\b0}Cooper got hurt.{\r}

251
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,540
我们正在急诊室等检查结果
{\fs10\b0}How hurt?{\r}

252
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,630
让我跟他说话
{\fs10\b0}Well, we're at the ER now. They're checking him out.{\r}

253
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,890
亲爱的  不行  他在另一个房间
{\fs10\b0}- Let me talk to him. - I can't, sweetie,{\r}

254
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,200
你怎么不跟他在一起
{\fs10\b0}he's in another room.{\r}

255
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,550
你为什么不陪着他
{\fs10\b0}Why aren't you with him?{\r}

256
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,590
你什么事都要扯到自己身上
{\fs10\b0}Always got to make it about you.{\r}

257
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,250
对  我就是这样
{\fs10\b0}Oh, yeah, that's what I'm doing.{\r}

258
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,030
什么事都扯到自己身上
{\fs10\b0}Making it about me.{\r}

259
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,640
安斯利在哪儿  在家
{\fs10\b0}- Where's Ainsley? - At the house.{\r}

260
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,380
跟一群吃了伟哥的石油工程师在一起
{\fs10\b0}With a bunch of petroleum engineers{\r}

261
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,860
手机一震动就来劲那种
{\fs10\b0}so hopped up on Cialis, they get a hard-on{\r}

262
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,040
都硬了
{\fs10\b0}when their phone vibrates?{\r}

263
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,480
有库珀的消息我就给你打电话  行吗
{\fs10\b0}Listen, as soon as I hear more about Cooper,{\r}

264
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,090
好吧
{\fs10\b0}I'll call you back. Okay?{\r}

265
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,960
汤米  我话还没说完呢
{\fs10\b0}Tommy, I am not done with you.{\r}

266
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,740
你知道离婚最大的好处就是
{\fs10\b0}You know, one of the great joys of being divorced is,{\r}

267
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,130
不用听这些废话了
{\fs10\b0}I don't have to listen to this shit.{\r}

268
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,220
好好享受沙滩吧  你胸挺不错
{\fs10\b0}Enjoy the beach. Your tits look great.{\r}

269
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,440
别得梅毒就行
{\fs10\b0}Don't get syphilis.{\r}

270
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,450
这建议真不错
{\fs10\b0}That's always sound advice.{\r}

271
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,100
是啊  活着的真理
{\fs10\b0}Yeah, words to live by.{\r}

272
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,360
我不用费力气解释了
{\fs10\b0}Let me save you the trouble.{\r}

273
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,540
只是确保你脾脏没事
{\fs10\b0}Just making sure the same thing didn't happen to your spleen.{\r}

274
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,410
还有其他地方疼吗
{\fs10\b0}No other pain?{\r}

275
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,810
就我用锤子砸到的手疼
{\fs10\b0}Just where I hit my hand with a fucking hammer.{\r}

276
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,330
让我看看
{\fs10\b0}Let me see that.{\r}

277
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,120
我去叫个手外科医生来
{\fs10\b0}I'm gonna call in a hand specialist.{\r}

278
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,380
接上这个是...
{\fs10\b0}Reattaching this is--{\r}

279
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,770
就是小指一点点而已
{\fs10\b0}It's just a tiny piece of a pinky.{\r}

280
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,990
我才不要做一年的手术
{\fs10\b0}I ain't dicking around with 12 surgeries for a fucking year.{\r}

281
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,300
直接切了缝上就行
{\fs10\b0}Just cut it off and sew up the fucking top.{\r}

282
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,170
我强烈建议你不要这样做
{\fs10\b0}I would strongly advise you against that.{\r}

283
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,870
要么你来要么我自己来
{\fs10\b0}Well, either you do it or I'll do it.{\r}

284
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,090
我不是外科医生
{\fs10\b0}I'm not a surgeon.{\r}

285
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,960
让我叫外科医生来
{\fs10\b0}Let me bring in the surgeon{\r}

286
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:10,390
我们可以商量...行吧  刚好这里
{\fs10\b0}- and we can discuss... Okay. - Well, it just so happens{\r}

287
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,400
就有个外科医生  等等
{\fs10\b0}- there's a surgeon right here. - Well, hold on.{\r}

288
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,960
这...
{\fs10\b0}Oh, that...{\r}

289
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,050
好极了  就这样
{\fs10\b0}- that's nice. - There she is.{\r}

290
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,100
注意你的腿
{\fs10\b0}Hey, uh, watch your leg.{\r}

291
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,800
搞定了
{\fs10\b0}There you go. Job done.{\r}

292
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:23,970
现在可以帮我缝合了吗
{\fs10\b0}Now, you care to stitch it?{\r}

293
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,800
你刚毕业吧
{\fs10\b0}Did you just get out of school?{\r}

294
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,020
你说有多大可能
{\fs10\b0}Hey, what are the chances{\r}

295
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,500
它自己结痂
{\fs10\b0}that, like, it just scabs over{\r}

296
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,160
过个月就好了
{\fs10\b0}and in a month it's good as new?{\r}

297
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,810
你觉得呢  这种可能性
{\fs10\b0}- What do you think? - The odds are{\r}

298
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,810
微乎其微
{\fs10\b0}astronomically against that.{\r}

299
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,420
更可能的是你会感染葡萄球菌
{\fs10\b0}What's more likely is, you get a staph infection{\r}

300
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
一个月后就得截肢了
{\fs10\b0}and in a month we're amputating your arm.{\r}

301
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,250
我去叫护士准备缝合
{\fs10\b0}I'll have a nurse prepare to suture.{\r}

302
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,600
谢谢
{\fs10\b0}I appreciate that.{\r}

303
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,950
知道我儿子在哪个房间吗
{\fs10\b0}- Mm-hmm. - You know what room{\r}

304
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:49,000
库珀·诺里斯
{\fs10\b0}my son's in? Cooper Norris?{\r}

305
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,780
急诊室五号
{\fs10\b0}Uh... ER Five.{\r}

306
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,310
我去看看他
{\fs10\b0}I'm gonna go see him.{\r}

307
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,270
我觉得你最好先不要动...
{\fs10\b0}I think it's best if you just sit tight--{\r}

308
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,530
准备好了就来找我
{\fs10\b0}Just come get me when you're ready.{\r}

309
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:58,830
至少先包扎一下
{\fs10\b0}At least cover it.{\r}

310
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:00,920
好吧
{\fs10\b0}All right.{\r}

311
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,410
你真是一点也不着急啊
{\fs10\b0}Boy, you sure ain't in no fucking hurry, are you?{\r}

312
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,990
找到他们了吗
{\fs10\b0}Did you find 'em?{\r}

313
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,080
找到一个  是哪个
{\fs10\b0}- One of them. - Which one?{\r}

314
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,650
现在无法确认
{\fs10\b0}There ain't no way to know.{\r}

315
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:35,260
要和我一起去通知家属吗
{\fs10\b0}You want to come with me? Notify next of kin?{\r}

316
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,400
不太想去
{\fs10\b0}Not really.{\r}

317
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,880
你去吗
{\fs10\b0}Will you?{\r}

318
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,490
去医院接我
{\fs10\b0}Pick me up at the hospital.{\r}

319
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,850
该死
{\fs10\b0}Shit.{\r}

320
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,920
你的手怎么了
{\fs10\b0}What happened to your hand?{\r}

321
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:25,050
这是一个值得铭记的教训
{\fs10\b0}Well, here's a life lesson worth filing away.{\r}

322
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:28,010
锤子和手打架  锤子必赢
{\fs10\b0}When hammer hits hand, hammer wins.{\r}

323
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,320
该你说了
{\fs10\b0}Your turn.{\r}

324
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,320
我也不知道
{\fs10\b0}I don't know.{\r}

325
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,970
他们让我去卡车上拿管钳
{\fs10\b0}They sent me to the truck to fetch a pipe wrench.{\r}

326
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:38,590
下一秒我就飞了出去
{\fs10\b0}Next thing I know, I'm flying through the air.{\r}

327
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,460
就这样  三个寡妇六个孤儿
{\fs10\b0}And just like that, three widows and six orphans.{\r}

328
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,720
八个孤儿
{\fs10\b0}Eight orphans.{\r}

329
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,990
这就是三百个理由中的第一个
{\fs10\b0}Here's reason number one of about 300{\r}

330
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,600
为什么你该找个更好的谋生方式
{\fs10\b0}why you might want to find a better way of making a living.{\r}

331
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,600
我能干什么
{\fs10\b0}What am I gonna do?{\r}

332
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,820
坐办公室卖芯片吗
{\fs10\b0}Sit in an office and sell fucking computer chips?{\r}

333
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,650
对  也许可以
{\fs10\b0}Yeah, maybe.{\r}

334
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:01,000
我知道该怎么做
{\fs10\b0}I know what I'm gonna do.{\r}

335
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:04,220
等他们把我的手指缝好
{\fs10\b0}When they sew up what's left of my fucking finger,{\r}

336
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,220
我就开车去路易斯家
{\fs10\b0}I'm gonna drive over to Luis's house{\r}

337
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,570
告诉他妻子  她失去了丈夫和两个侄子
{\fs10\b0}and tell his wife she's lost a husband and two nephews.{\r}

338
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,920
然后我要去阿曼多家
{\fs10\b0}And then I'm going over to Armando's house{\r}

339
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,840
做同样的事
{\fs10\b0}and do the same kind of thing.{\r}

340
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,970
再去埃尔维奥家
{\fs10\b0}And then I'm going out to Elvio's house{\r}

341
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,670
告诉那个22岁的母亲
{\fs10\b0}to tell a 22-year-old mother{\r}

342
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,670
赶紧去找份工作养家糊口
{\fs10\b0}to break out the fucking want ads and get a job.{\r}

343
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,550
没时间悲伤  没时间哀悼
{\fs10\b0}No time to grieve, no time to mourn.{\r}

344
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,810
因为银行不会等人
{\fs10\b0}'Cause banks don't wait.{\r}

345
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,380
你也该看看求职广告了
{\fs10\b0}You might want to look at the want ads yourself,{\r}

346
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:34,080
你这个自私的混蛋
{\fs10\b0}you selfish little son of a bitch,{\r}

347
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,510
不然我就得和你妈
{\fs10\b0}before I'm having the same conversation with your mother{\r}

348
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:38,820
说同样的话了
{\fs10\b0}as I'm about to have with Elvio's wife.{\r}

349
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:47,050
我自私  那你算什么
{\fs10\b0}If I'm so selfish, what does that make you?{\r}

350
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,790
一个负债50万的离婚酗酒鬼
{\fs10\b0}A divorced alcoholic with $500,000 in debt...{\r}

351
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,440
而我还是幸运的那个
{\fs10\b0}...and I'm one of the lucky ones.{\r}

352
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,000
加油  格蕾西
{\fs10\b0}Come on, Gracie.{\r}

353
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,480

{\fs10\b0}Were they independent contractors?{\r}

354
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,660
不  是我们的人
{\fs10\b0}No, they were ours.{\r}

355
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,920
知道到底发生什么事了吗
{\fs10\b0}Any idea what the fuck happened?{\r}

356
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,450
抽油机很旧了
{\fs10\b0}Well, it's a pretty old jack.{\r}

357
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,970
肯定是阀门的问题
{\fs10\b0}It's gonna be one of the valves.{\r}

358
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,490
油罐阀门锈死了
{\fs10\b0}Tank valve was rusted shut,{\r}

359
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,890
我估计其他阀门也一样
{\fs10\b0}and I assume it's the same with the other ones.{\r}

360
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,580
有人用扳手敲击时产生火花
{\fs10\b0}Somebody banged it with a wrench and created a spark{\r}

361
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,070
点燃了泄漏的天然气  我是这么猜的
{\fs10\b0}and ignited that gas leak. That's my guess anyhow.{\r}

362
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,280
职业安全与健康署会得出同样结论吗
{\fs10\b0}Is OSHA gonna come to the same conclusion?{\r}

363
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,900
他们也会这么假设
{\fs10\b0}Well, they'll have the same assumption.{\r}

364
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,640
抽油机都融化了
{\fs10\b0}That pumpjack melted like butter.{\r}

365
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:57,120
你看不出现场
{\fs10\b0}You can't look at the site{\r}

366
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,510
能得出什么明确结论
{\fs10\b0}and come to any kind of definite conclusion.{\r}

367
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,640
你打算怎么办
{\fs10\b0}What do you want to do?{\r}

一笔帮他们渡过难关的礼物
{\fs10\b0}A gift, just to get 'em through.{\r}

372
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:11,740

{\fs10\b0}- How much? - 250 each.{\r}

373

{\fs10\b0}If you saw it, why you doing it?{\r}

382
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,160
伙计  我现在没心情
{\fs10\b0}Buddy, I'm in no mood.{\r}

383
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,510

384
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:46,430
没心情是我的口头禅
{\fs10\b0}"I'm in no mood" is my fucking motto.{\r}

385
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,820

{\fs10\b0}I quit drinking. I'll stick with beer.{\r}

473
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,520
你知道啤酒里也有酒精吧
{\fs10\b0}You know, there's alcohol in that, right?{\r}

474
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,130
这是超清淡啤酒
{\fs10\b0}It's a Michelob Ultra.{\r}

475
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,180
橙汁的酒精度都比这高
{\fs10\b0}There's more alcohol in orange juice.{\r}

476
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:35,530
我不是在评判你 伙计
{\fs10\b0}I ain't judging, buddy.{\r}

477
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,140
我已经戒酒八年了
{\fs10\b0}I mean, I've been on the wagon eight years.{\r}

478
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,710
我只是说喝啤酒也算喝酒
{\fs10\b0}I'm just saying, drinking beer is still drinking.{\r}

479
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,360
我告诉你
{\fs10\b0}Well, I tell you what, bud,{\r}

480
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,490
你看我喝六瓶这玩意
{\fs10\b0}you watch me drink six of these sons of bitches,{\r}

481
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,230
明晚我再来这里
{\fs10\b0}and I'll come back in here tomorrow night{\r}

482
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:45,800
喝六杯威士忌 你再看看
{\fs10\b0}and drink six whiskeys, and you tell me{\r}

483
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,020
有什么差别
{\fs10\b0}if you notice a fucking difference.{\r}

484
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,460
我相信你说的
{\fs10\b0}I'll take your word for it.{\r}

485
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,770
超清淡啤酒
{\fs10\b0}Michelob Ultra.{\r}

486
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,770
嘿  嘿
{\fs10\b0}- Hey. -  Hey.{\r}

487
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,640
你没给我回电话  抱歉
{\fs10\b0}- You didn't call me back. - Sorry.{\r}

488
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,430
他醒了而且意识清醒 会观察一晚
{\fs10\b0}He's awake and alert. They're keeping him overnight.{\r}

489
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,870
你那点小伤怎么样了
{\fs10\b0}And how's your little boo-boo?{\r}

490
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,610
比早上短了一英吋
{\fs10\b0}An inch shorter than it was this morning.{\r}

491
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,310
这一句话就概括了我们的婚姻
{\fs10\b0}If that doesn't sum up our marriage in a sentence.{\r}

492
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,960
我敢说我还比你嫁的
{\fs10\b0}Well, I bet you I still got a few inches{\r}

493
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:14,790
那个胖子提款机长几英吋呢
{\fs10\b0}on that fat-ass ATM you married.{\r}

494
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,180
你知道那句老话
{\fs10\b0}Well, you know the old saying,{\r}

495
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,090
银行账户上每多一个逗号
{\fs10\b0}"Every comma in your bank account{\r}

496
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:20,530
就能让你那里多长两英吋
{\fs10\b0}adds two inches to your penis,"{\r}

497
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,530
那你可要赶紧追上来了
{\fs10\b0}which is to say you're way behind.{\r}

498
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,010
这话说得好
{\fs10\b0}That's good to know.{\r}

499
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,970
我觉得我应该在那里
{\fs10\b0}I feel like I should be there.{\r}

500
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:28,580
我该过去吗  我觉得很内疚
{\fs10\b0}Should I be there? I feel guilty.{\r}

501
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,190
你该内疚
{\fs10\b0}You should feel guilty.{\r}

502
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:32,800
我值得放个假  休什么假
{\fs10\b0}- I deserve a vacation. - From what?{\r}

503
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,680
你在那边做的事
{\fs10\b0}You're doing exactly the same fucking thing{\r}

504
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:36,810
跟在家做的一样 只是不能喝自来水
{\fs10\b0}you do at home, except you can't drink the water.{\r}

505
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,550
所以你是说我该过去
{\fs10\b0}So you're saying I should come?{\r}

506
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,070
有必要吗  没有
{\fs10\b0}Do you need to? No.{\r}

507
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,860
不过你是他们的母亲 如果你觉得
{\fs10\b0}But you're their mother, so if you feel like{\r}

508
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,820
自己该在这里  那就该过来
{\fs10\b0}you ought to be here, you probably should come.{\r}

509
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,210
你想让我过去吗
{\fs10\b0}Do you want me to come?{\r}

510
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,820
安吉拉 你来不来我都无所谓
{\fs10\b0}Angela, I couldn't care less if you come or not.{\r}

511
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:50,910
我收回前言
{\fs10\b0}I stand corrected.{\r}

512
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,520
这句话才是我们婚姻的真实写照
{\fs10\b0}That is the sentence that sums up our marriage.{\r}

513
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,610
明天见 混蛋
{\fs10\b0}I'll see you tomorrow, you fucking asshole.{\r}

558
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:45,430
我不知道他们是你朋友
{\fs10\b0}I didn't know they were friends.{\r}

563
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,880

{\fs10\b0}It lends itself to more exposure.{\r}

564
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,060
你是律师

572
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,990
你居然能面不改色地说这话
{\fs10\b0}I can't believe you said that with a straight face.{\r}

573
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,420

580
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,690

{\fs10\b0}if you're litigating a petroleum liability case?{\r}

{\fs10\b0}My specialty is chain of liability,{\r}

582
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,430

{\fs10\b0}This happened when I was on the plane.{\r}

585
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,440
也许他们该派另一个律师来
{\fs10\b0}Maybe they should send another attorney.{\r}

586
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:21,880
我听说有人活了下来
{\fs10\b0}I understand one of them survived.{\r}

{\fs10\b0}- Not today. - When?{\r}

590
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,670
等他他妈的出院再说
{\fs10\b0}How about when he gets out of the fucking hospital?{\r}

591
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,540
还有什么事吗
{\fs10\b0}Anything else?{\r}

592
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,460
从这里你能看出什么
{\fs10\b0}What can you tell from this?{\r}

593
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:39,200
从油井看不出什么
{\fs10\b0}From the well? Nothing.{\r}

594
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:41,070
从火势类型来看呢
{\fs10\b0}From the type of fire?{\r}

595
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,380
有泄漏
{\fs10\b0}There was a leak.{\r}

596
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,290
一个钻井工用锤子和扳手
{\fs10\b0}A roughneck created a spark{\r}

597
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,600
试图打开阀门时引起了火花
{\fs10\b0}when he tried to open the valve with a hammer and a wrench.{\r}

598
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,030
他为什么要用锤子开
{\fs10\b0}Why would he try to open it with a hammer?{\r}

599
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,430
因为这他妈就是开阀门的方法
{\fs10\b0}'Cause that's how you open the fucking thing.{\r}

600
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,300
这看起来不太安全
{\fs10\b0}Doesn't seem very safe.{\r}

601
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,210
是不安全  所以他们年薪18万
{\fs10\b0}It's not very safe. That's why they make 180 grand a year.{\r}

602
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:57,090
为了这点钱冒生命危险不值得
{\fs10\b0}That's not enough money to risk your life on.{\r}

603
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,650
对你来说可能是
{\fs10\b0}Yeah, for you, maybe.{\r}

604
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,440
但对只上过初中的重刑犯来说
{\fs10\b0}For a felon with an eighth-grade education,{\r}

605
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,090
这就是中彩票
{\fs10\b0}it's a fucking lottery ticket.{\r}

606
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,870
对于那些油企经理来说
{\fs10\b0}And for an oil company whose manager{\r}

607
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:06,310
明知故犯  派员工去违反职业安全标准的故障油井
{\fs10\b0}knowingly sends employees to faulty wells{\r}

608
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:08,400
这就是一场价值数亿的诉讼
{\fs10\b0}that violate OSHA standards,{\r}

609
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:09,880
那整个该死的行业都有罪
{\fs10\b0}it's a nine-figure lawsuit.{\r}

610
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:12,540
所以整个行业都该死
{\fs10\b0}Well, then the whole goddamn industry's guilty.{\r}

611
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,720
我是站在你这边的  汤米
{\fs10\b0}I'm on your side, Tommy.{\r}

612
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,680
你需要明白这一点
{\fs10\b0}You need to understand that.{\r}

613
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:25,980
我很清楚
{\fs10\b0}Yeah, I understand plenty.{\r}

614
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,640
你和站在我这边差得远着呢
{\fs10\b0}You're the farthest thing from being on my side.{\r}

615
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:10,680
该死  该死
{\fs10\b0}Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch.{\r}

616
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:21,040
信息  教育
{\fs10\b0}Information, education,{\r}

617
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:24,430
和想像力是对抗石油和天然气行业冲击的
{\fs10\b0}and imagination are the weapons against the assault{\r}

618
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,300
武器
{\fs10\b0}on oil and natural gas.{\r}

619
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:30,530
但他们用来对付我们的武器
{\fs10\b0}But the weapon being used against us{\r}

620
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:31,920
更加危险
{\fs10\b0}is far more dangerous.{\r}

621
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,010
那就是情绪
{\fs10\b0}Emotion.{\r}

622
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:37,320
情绪是环保运动的矛头
{\fs10\b0}Emotion is the spear of the green movement.{\r}

623
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:39,010
你一开始是怎么把我拉来的
{\fs10\b0}How did you rope me into this in the first place?{\r}

624
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,360
这不是个约会吗
{\fs10\b0}Wasn't this a...? This was a date?{\r}

625
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:41,490
来嘛宝贝  这就是个约会  嗯
{\fs10\b0}- Come on, babe. It is a date. - Mm-hmm.{\r}

626
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:42,190
这只是约会的开始
{\fs10\b0}It's just the beginning of a date.{\r}

627
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,450
哦  约会结束时
{\fs10\b0}- Oh. - The end of the date{\r}

628
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,540
才是最精彩的部分  你知道的
{\fs10\b0}is when the date gets fun, you know that.{\r}

629
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,890
最好是这样
{\fs10\b0}It better.{\r}

630
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,370
主流媒体已经抛弃了
{\fs10\b0}Mainstream media has abandoned{\r}

631
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,680
支持事实的证据
{\fs10\b0}evidence supporting facts{\r}

632
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:50,890
他们惊慌失措 因为观众都转向了
{\fs10\b0}in their panic to prevent the exodus{\r}

633
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:53,240
推特和抖音
{\fs10\b0}of their audience to Twitter and TikTok{\r}

634
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,160
作为可靠的新闻来源
{\fs10\b0}as reliable news sources.{\r}

635
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:56,250
这还是在俄罗斯之前
{\fs10\b0}And that's before Russia...{\r}

636
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,730
该死  中国
{\fs10\b0}- Shit. - ...China,{\r}

637
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,030
伊朗 真主党  需要接电话吗
{\fs10\b0}- Iran, Hezbollah... - Do you need to get that?{\r}

638
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:00,690
哈马斯 基地组织  不 我不确定
{\fs10\b0}- ...Hamas, Al-Qaeda... - No, I'm not sure.{\r}

639
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,040
他们在社交媒体上充斥着
{\fs10\b0}...all of them flooding social media...{\r}

640
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:03,210
我觉得我马上就知道了
{\fs10\b0}I feel like I'm about to find out.{\r}

641
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:04,600
伪装成气候变化恐慌的
{\fs10\b0}...with propaganda masquerading{\r}

642
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,870
宣传
{\fs10\b0}- as fear of climate change. -{\r}

643
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,830
是的  我想我得接这个
{\fs10\b0}Yep. I do think I have to get this.{\r}

644
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,440
好吧
{\fs10\b0}Okay.{\r}

645
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:12,740
帮我占个座
{\fs10\b0}Will you save my seat?{\r}

646
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:14,960
看你去多久了
{\fs10\b0}Depends on how long you're gone.{\r}

647
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,490
可以说是最没文化的群众
{\fs10\b0}...in arguably the most uneducated populace...{\r}

648
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,970
嘿  让我一会儿回你电话
{\fs10\b0}Hey. Let me call you right back.{\r}

649
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,180
我得找个安静的地方
{\fs10\b0}Yeah, I got to find someplace quiet.{\r}

650
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,270
什么事  什么事
{\fs10\b0}-  Yeah? - What is it?{\r}

651
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:06,540
你他妈觉得是什么事
{\fs10\b0}The fuck do you think it is?{\r}

652
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,890
你派来这条员工关系部门的毒蛇
{\fs10\b0}Who is this employee relations pit viper{\r}

653
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,020
是来咬我的吗
{\fs10\b0}you sent out here to bite me?{\r}

654
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:12,930
我按你说的打给了钱德勒
{\fs10\b0}Uh, I called Chandler like you said.{\r}

655
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:14,330
但他们没派他来
{\fs10\b0}Well, they didn't fucking send him!{\r}

656
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,760
他们派人来整我
{\fs10\b0}They sent somebody out here to hang me out.{\r}

657
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:20,030
你没有一口油井能通过职业安全标准  蒙蒂
{\fs10\b0}You don't have a well that will pass OSHA standards, Monty.{\r}

658
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,550
一口都没有
{\fs10\b0}Not fucking one.{\r}

659
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:23,510
我是个混蛋  蒙蒂
{\fs10\b0}I'm a lot of shit, Monty,{\r}

660
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,210
但我不是他妈的替罪羊  明白吗
{\fs10\b0}but I ain't a fucking patsy, you understand me?{\r}

661
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,300
我打给了克莱
{\fs10\b0}I called Clay,{\r}

662
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:29,170
他说他正飞去找你
{\fs10\b0}who said he was flying to you.{\r}

663
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,650
我不知道他们为什么没派克莱
{\fs10\b0}Now, I don't know who they sent that isn't Clay,{\r}

664
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:31,690
但我会查清楚
{\fs10\b0}but I will find out.{\r}

665
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:32,910
很好
{\fs10\b0}Good.{\r}

666
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,350
听着
{\fs10\b0}Now, look,{\r}

667
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,300
我们这行业总是危机不断
{\fs10\b0}our business is one of constant crisis{\r}

668
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,130
偶尔会有短暂的成功
{\fs10\b0}interrupted by brief periods of intense success.{\r}

669
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:40,740
这你应该比任何人都清楚
{\fs10\b0}You should know that better than anyone else.{\r}

670
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,220
今天是很糟糕
{\fs10\b0}Now, today was a rough one.{\r}

671
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,620
我能理解你情绪激动
{\fs10\b0}And I can understand why you might be emotional,{\r}

672
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,050
但别让情绪
{\fs10\b0}but don't let your emotions{\r}

673
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,450
让你忘了谁是老板
{\fs10\b0}confuse you as to who the boss is.{\r}

674
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,190
老板是我
{\fs10\b0}The boss is me,{\r}

675
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,800
别他妈再对我大吼大叫
{\fs10\b0}and don't you ever raise your fucking voice at me again.{\r}

676
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,780
亲爱的 我在回家路上
{\fs10\b0}I'm on the way home, honey.{\r}

677
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,910
我快饿死了
{\fs10\b0}Yeah, I'm starving.{\r}

678
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:17,260
不是那种"我好饿好像要饿死了"的感觉
{\fs10\b0}Like not, "I'm so hungry, I feel like I'm starving."{\r}

679
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:18,780
是真的快饿死了
{\fs10\b0}I'm starving.{\r}

680
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,390
我脸色都发白了
{\fs10\b0}Like, my skin looks pale,{\r}

681
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:23,440
器官都要衰竭了  厨房里
{\fs10\b0}- my organs are shutting down. - Well, there's{\r}

682
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:25,180
有很多吃的 亲爱的
{\fs10\b0}a kitchen full of food in there, honey.{\r}

683
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:28,050
爸爸 厨房里全是致癌的加工食品
{\fs10\b0}Daddy, there's a kitchen full of processed cancer bombs.{\r}

684
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:30,230
谁会整箱整箱买多力多滋啊
{\fs10\b0}And who orders Doritos by the palette?{\r}

685
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,880
我需要蛋白质
{\fs10\b0}I need protein.{\r}

686
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:34,140
橱柜里有蛋白质
{\fs10\b0}There's protein in the cupboard.{\r}

687
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,100
维也纳香肠不算蛋白质 爸爸
{\fs10\b0}Vienna sausages is not protein, Daddy.{\r}

688
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:37,760
这是那些连做热狗都嫌恶心的
{\fs10\b0}You know, it's all the parts of a cow{\r}

689
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:39,540
牛肉残渣做的
{\fs10\b0}that are too gross to be in hot dogs.{\r}

690
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:41,460
是猪肉 不过我不想争这个
{\fs10\b0}Well, it's pork, but I'm not gonna have that fight.{\r}

691
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:43,330
要我给你带点别的吗
{\fs10\b0}You want me to pick you something up?{\r}

692
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:48,120
能给我带一个动物风味生菜包汉堡吗
{\fs10\b0}Could you get me an animal-style Whataburger wrapped in lettuce?{\r}

693
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:49,770
动物什么
{\fs10\b0}An animal what?{\r}

694
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:51,680
就是特制酱料
{\fs10\b0}It's, like, special sauce.{\r}

695
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:54,080
不要面包 用生菜包着
{\fs10\b0}And there's no bun. They, like, wrap it in lettuce.{\r}

696
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:55,820
生菜都是切碎的 怎么包
{\fs10\b0}How can they wrap it in lettuce? Their lettuce is shredded.{\r}

697
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:57,690
我每次要他们都会做的
{\fs10\b0}Well, they always do it when I ask.{\r}

698
00:44:57,910 --> 00:44:59,780
他们会去后厨拿整片生菜
{\fs10\b0}They just go in the back, and they get the whole lettuce.{\r}

699
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:01,300
咱俩活在不同的世界里
{\fs10\b0}You and I live in different worlds.{\r}

700
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,000
他们肯定要我滚蛋
{\fs10\b0}They'll tell me to fuck myself.{\r}

701
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:04,440
要不我给你买个汉堡
{\fs10\b0}Why don't I just get you a burger,{\r}

702
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:06,480
你自己扔掉面包
{\fs10\b0}and you throw the buns away?{\r}

703
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:09,220
好吧 那就这样
{\fs10\b0}Yeah. Yeah, I guess we could do that.{\r}

704
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,050
再给我三根薯条和一杯健怡可乐
{\fs10\b0}And could you get me three fries and a Diet Coke?{\r}

705
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:12,570
所以
{\fs10\b0}So,{\r}

706
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,790
你不吃面包 却要三份
{\fs10\b0}you won't eat the buns, but you'll eat three orders{\r}

707
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:16,450
薯条  不是
{\fs10\b0}- of fries? - No!{\r}

708
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:18,620
我要三根薯条 你得挑出三根
{\fs10\b0}I want three fries. You have to pick out three,{\r}

709
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,150
其他的都扔掉
{\fs10\b0}and then throw the rest of them away.{\r}

710
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,930
好吧 还要什么吗
{\fs10\b0}Okay. Anything else?{\r}

711
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,460
谢谢爸爸
{\fs10\b0}Thank you, Daddy.{\r}

712
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:27,630
你快到了吗
{\fs10\b0}Are you close?{\r}

713
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:30,420
没 这还得多花十分钟
{\fs10\b0}No, and this is gonna add ten minutes to the trip, too.{\r}

714
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:31,770
那就15分钟
{\fs10\b0}So, like, 15?{\r}

715
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:32,990
一个小时
{\fs10\b0}Like, an hour.{\r}

716
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,680
一个小时
{\fs10\b0}An hour?!{\r}

717
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,430
希望我还活着
{\fs10\b0}I hope I'm still alive.{\r}

718
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,910
这些挑战
{\fs10\b0}Well,{\r}

719
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,430
会让你变得更坚强
{\fs10\b0}these are the challenges that harden you{\r}

720
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,040
以应对生命中的不幸 亲爱的
{\fs10\b0}for life's tragedies, honey.{\r}

721
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:43,170
待会见
{\fs10\b0}I'll see you soon.{\r}

722
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:46,910
好 谢谢 我爱你
{\fs10\b0}Okay, thank you. I love you.{\r}

723
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:48,520
我也爱你 亲爱的
{\fs10\b0}Okay, love you, too, honey.{\r}

724
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,350
我很快就到  你能快点吗
{\fs10\b0}- I'll be there soon. - Will you hurry?{\r}

725
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,260
好 我会快点的
{\fs10\b0}Yeah, I'll hurry.{\r}

726
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,920
好 爱你 拜
{\fs10\b0}Okay. Love you. Bye.{\r}

727
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,790
爱你 拜
{\fs10\b0}- Love you. Bye. -{\r}

728
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,440
天啊
{\fs10\b0}Goddamn!{\r}

729
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:56,750
妈的
{\fs10\b0}Shit.{\r}

730
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,230
你要去哪
{\fs10\b0}Where you headed?{\r}

731
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,540
脱衣舞俱乐部
{\fs10\b0}To the strip club.{\r}

732
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:01,880
咱们女儿在那里
{\fs10\b0}While our daughter's there?{\r}

733
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,450
对 她要来见我
{\fs10\b0}Yeah, she's meeting me there.{\r}

734
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:05,760
我觉得是时候让她见识下生活的阴暗面了
{\fs10\b0}I thought it's time she sees the darker side of life.{\r}

735
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:08,110
你到底要去哪
{\fs10\b0}Where are you really headed?{\r}

736
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:09,890
我要回家
{\fs10\b0}I'm going home.{\r}

737
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,370
你看起来很累
{\fs10\b0}You look tired.{\r}

738
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,510
这是有原因的
{\fs10\b0}There's a reason for that.{\r}

739
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,380
我其实不一定要去
{\fs10\b0}I don't really need to come.{\r}

740
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:18,340
我有必要去吗
{\fs10\b0}Do I need to come?{\r}

741
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:20,820
我说了你不需要来
{\fs10\b0}I already told you you don't need to come.{\r}

742
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:23,380
如果我想来呢
{\fs10\b0}What if I want to come?{\r}

743
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,690
你为什么想来
{\fs10\b0}Why would you want to do that?{\r}

744
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:26,690
如果我就是想呢
{\fs10\b0}What if I did?{\r}

745
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:29,610
你要从卡波圣卢卡斯来到德克萨斯的米德兰
{\fs10\b0}You want to leave Cabo and come to Midland, Texas{\r}

746
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:32,130
在有三个室友的出租屋里和你前夫上床
{\fs10\b0}to fuck your ex-husband in a rent house with three roommates?{\r}

747
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:33,960
我怎么觉得不太可能
{\fs10\b0}Why do I doubt that?{\r}

748
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:36,480
你就不能盼着我来吗
{\fs10\b0}Can't you just fucking want me to come?{\r}

749
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:37,920
你就不能这样吗
{\fs10\b0}Why can't you do that?{\r}

750
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:41,180
亲爱的 我当然想让你来
{\fs10\b0}Oh, honey, I want you to come, believe me.{\r}

751
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,930
我只是知道你不会来
{\fs10\b0}I mean, I just know you'll never do it.{\r}

752
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,190
这让我很心痛 我真的很想让你来
{\fs10\b0}Breaks my heart. I really want you to.{\r}

753
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,500
我打赌你待会会想这事的
{\fs10\b0}You'll think about it later, I bet.{\r}

754
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:50,150
我得和女儿睡一张床
{\fs10\b0}Well, since I'm sharing a bed with our daughter,{\r}

755
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:52,280
所以我最好别想这事了
{\fs10\b0}I hope I don't think about it later.{\r}

756
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,330
好吧 晚安 安吉
{\fs10\b0}Okay. Good night, Angie.{\r}

757
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:59,900
嗯 晚安
{\fs10\b0}Mm-hmm. Good night.{\r}

758
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:50,910
感谢上帝
{\fs10\b0}Thank you, God.{\r}

759
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,000
拿着
{\fs10\b0}There you go.{\r}

760
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:58,260
我说服他们用生菜包的
{\fs10\b0}I talked them into the lettuce thing in back there.{\r}

761
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:01,400
你怎么做到的  给他们看了你的照片
{\fs10\b0}- How'd you do that? - Showed 'em your picture.{\r}

762
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:07,880
爸爸 我说要三根薯条 这里有一整份
{\fs10\b0}Daddy, I said three fries. There's a whole order in here.{\r}

763
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:09,580
其他的是我的  那样的话
{\fs10\b0}- Well, the rest are for me. - Well,{\r}

764
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:10,670
我肯定会说服你给我的 爸爸
{\fs10\b0}I'm just gonna talk you out of them, Daddy.{\r}

765
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,540
你得把它们扔掉
{\fs10\b0}You need to throw 'em away.{\r}

766
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:14,020
现在 现在就扔
{\fs10\b0}Now. Now!{\r}

767
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:20,500
你八岁的时候这样很可爱
{\fs10\b0}You know, this shit was cute when you were eight,{\r}

768
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,680
但现在我满脑子想的都是你第一次结婚
{\fs10\b0}but now all I think about's your first marriage{\r}

769
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:25,640
那个可怜的家伙受够这些事后
{\fs10\b0}and the skid marks that poor bastard leaves{\r}

770
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:27,380
留下的刹车印
{\fs10\b0}after he's had a few years of this shit.{\r}

771
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:29,860
你讨厌是因为你是我父亲
{\fs10\b0}It annoys you because you're my father,{\r}

772
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:32,470
你不想和我上床
{\fs10\b0}and you don't want to have sex with me.{\r}

773
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,600
但其他男孩会把这些要求看作是
{\fs10\b0}But other boys look at these chores like...{\r}

774
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:36,080
小小的寻宝游戏
{\fs10\b0}little treasure hunts.{\r}

775
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:41,170
对了 你哥住院了 我忘了告诉你
{\fs10\b0}Oh, your brother's in the hospital. I forgot to tell you.{\r}

776
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:43,130
对不起  在哪
{\fs10\b0}- Sorry about that. - Where?{\r}

777
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:44,870
这里
{\fs10\b0}Here.{\r}

778
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:47,180
他在米德兰干什么  为我工作
{\fs10\b0}- What's he doing in Midland? - Working for me.{\r}

779
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:49,700
他不是五月才毕业吗
{\fs10\b0}But he doesn't graduate till May.{\r}

780
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,190
他永远都毕不了业了 他退学了
{\fs10\b0}He don't graduate ever. He dropped out.{\r}

781
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,580
他想在油田工作
{\fs10\b0}He wants to work in the patch.{\r}

782
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:56,840
他真是个废物
{\fs10\b0}He is such a loser.{\r}

783
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,500
爸爸 我不是那个意思
{\fs10\b0}Daddy, I didn't... I didn't mean it like that.{\r}

784
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:05,590
让我告诉你一件事 亲爱的
{\fs10\b0}Let me tell you something, honey.{\r}

785
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,460
在油田工作的人分两种
{\fs10\b0}There's two types of people that work in the patch--{\r}

786
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,250
梦想家和失败者
{\fs10\b0}dreamers and losers.{\r}

787
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:15,340
以前整个国家都是这样
{\fs10\b0}Used to be that way in the whole nation.{\r}

788
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:22,080
失败者都西行 不是死就是成功
{\fs10\b0}Failures headed out West to either die or succeed.{\r}

789
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:25,040
一直到加利福尼亚
{\fs10\b0}All the way to California.{\r}

790
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:29,480
但那里现在已经没有梦想家了
{\fs10\b0}But there's not any dreamers out there anymore,{\r}

791
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,090
只有小偷和傻瓜
{\fs10\b0}just thieves and fools.{\r}

792
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,140
梦想家们现在来这里
{\fs10\b0}This is where dreamers come now.{\r}

793
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:40,280
失败者来这里寻求成功
{\fs10\b0}And losers come here to win.{\r}

794
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,330
你想当哪一种
{\fs10\b0}Which one are you gonna be?{\r}

795
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,110
梦想家
{\fs10\b0}A dreamer.{\r}

796
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:53,420
第一次尝试总是会失败
{\fs10\b0}First attempt's always a failure,{\r}

797
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:55,340
所以你会先成为失败者
{\fs10\b0}so it means you're gonna be a loser.{\r}

798
00:49:56,510 --> 00:49:59,120
不知道你会怎么做
{\fs10\b0}Wonder what you'll do then.{\r}

799
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:08,170
今晚你睡我的房间 我睡沙发
{\fs10\b0}You take my room tonight, and I'll, uh, take the couch.{\r}

800
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,900
现在你应该明白了
{\fs10\b0}Well, I guess now{\r}

801
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,380
我说的"钻井工人很危险"是什么意思
{\fs10\b0}you understand what I mean by "roughnecking's dangerous."{\r}

802
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,820
这话从一个每天抽两包烟的人嘴里说出来
{\fs10\b0}Says the two-pack-a-day smoker.{\r}

803
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,260
再过三个月你就能拿到
{\fs10\b0}In three months, you could've had{\r}

804
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:33,610
地质学学位了 你却
{\fs10\b0}a fucking degree in geology, and you...{\r}

805
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:35,830
我不需要学位
{\fs10\b0}I don't need a degree.{\r}

806
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,390
我学到了需要的地质知识
{\fs10\b0}I learned all I need about geology.{\r}

807
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:39,270
我不想教这些 我想亲身实践
{\fs10\b0}I don't want to teach the shit, I want to live it.{\r}

808
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:40,920
我想做土地中介
{\fs10\b0}I want to be a landman.{\r}

809
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:42,530
像蒙蒂·米勒那样的人
{\fs10\b0}Well, for every Monty Miller,{\r}

810
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:43,970
一百个里面只有一个 好吗
{\fs10\b0}there's a hundred of me, all right?{\r}

811
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:47,270
你和蒙蒂的区别就是他没有放弃
{\fs10\b0}The only difference between you and Monty is Monty didn't quit.{\r}

812
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:56,370
我和蒙蒂的区别在于
{\fs10\b0}The difference in me{\r}

813
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:58,890
我没有该死的信托基金
{\fs10\b0}and Monty is I don't have a fucking trust fund.{\r}

814
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:00,810
我不是主动退出的  而是被迫流血退场的
{\fs10\b0}I didn't quit, I bled out.{\r}

815
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:03,160
而且我也没见你去投机
{\fs10\b0}And besides, I don't see you speculating{\r}

816
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:05,470
或者四处寻找机会  或争取矿产权
{\fs10\b0}or banging on doors, or hustling mineral rights.{\r}

817
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:08,730
不  你只是钻井队的新手
{\fs10\b0}No, you're the worm on a drill crew.{\r}

818
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,560
不好意思  你曾经是
{\fs10\b0}Excuse me, you were.{\r}

819
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:13,650
而你的队伍第一天就全军覆没了
{\fs10\b0}And your crew is fucking dead on day one.{\r}

820
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:15,390
这就是给你的警示
{\fs10\b0}So, take the fucking hint!{\r}

821
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:21,260
如果我想将来经营一家石油公司
