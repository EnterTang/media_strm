CARL AZUZ: It's been a
little over five months

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,200
since a major hurricane made
landfall in the Bahamas,

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,560
and it could be
another five months

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,010
before electricity is completely
restored to some places.

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,530
That's our first subject
of the week here on CNN 10.

9
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,440
My name is Carl Azuz,
I'm at the CNN Center.

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,790
The year 1851 was the first year
when officials started keeping

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,670
track of hurricanes, and
since then, at least,

12
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,680
no storm that's
hit the Bahamas was

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,840
as strong as Hurricane Dorian.

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,940
It made landfall
there on September 1st

15
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,670
as a category 5
hurricane, the strongest

16
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,440
classification of storm.

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,240
It weakened to
category 4 strength

18
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,420
as it passed over the islands,
but one thing that made Dorian

19
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,580
so destructive was its speed.

20
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,190
Hurricanes are damaging enough
when they pass over land

21
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,820
in a couple of hours, but
Dorian came to a near stop

22
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,280
when it was over the
Bahamas, blasting part

23
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,860
of the chain for
more than 36 hours

24
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,590
with unrelenting
wind, waves, and rain.

25
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,570
So many homes were
destroyed that even

26
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,480
now, there aren't enough
people living in the Bahamas

27
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,100
to rebuild quickly.

28
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,800
In the town of Marsh Harbor,
in the Abaco islands,

29
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,350
witnesses say it doesn't look
like anything's been done

30
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,530
to repair some hard hit
areas, and that stray dogs

31
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,330
are the only signs of life.

32
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,310
For some people who
evacuated or had

33
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,480
to leave after their
homes were destroyed,

34
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,060
they couldn't go back
if they wanted to.

35
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,830
There's nowhere
for them to stay.

36
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:32,330
The Bahamian
government is working

37
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:35,570
to set up domes, temporary
houses to address that.

38
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,710
And for those who are
trying to rebuild,

39
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,150
there's a sense of urgency,
because June 1st less than four

40
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,220
months from now, is
the official start

41
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,990
of the next hurricane season.

42
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,300
Volunteers have committed
to helping the Bahamas

43
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,410
rebuild and prepare.

44
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:53,000
- We know that the
waterline came up higher,

45
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,870
so we know for a fact
that there's going

46
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,520
to be mold behind these tiles.

47
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,320
So they had to come off.

48
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,086


49
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:02,200
DAVID EISENBAUM: We're
here in Marsh Harbor

50
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,670
on the island of great Abaco.

51
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,730
It really was the epicenter
of Hurricane Dorian,

52
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:10,580
and experienced the most
extreme damage from the storm.

53
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,980
All Hands and Hearts
has made a commitment

54
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,750
to be here for at
least two years

55
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,980
to help the community recover.

56
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,120
RYAN FORBES: We're so
thankful and so grateful.

57
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,820
And we are so
appreciative of the help

58
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,230
that you guys have given us.

59
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,250
You know, and the sacrifices you
guys are making is much needed.

60
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,510
DAVID EISENBAUM: We
are going to continue

61
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,060
working in the response phase,
doing mucking and gutting

62
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:33,430
and debris removal,
and sanitizing homes,

63
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,400
and begin to accelerate
more of the recovery

64
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,926
and rebuild work that we do.

65
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:39,726
- There we go.

66
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:40,526
Nice.

67
00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:41,425
- Beautiful.

68
00:02:41,425 --> 00:02:42,558
DAVID EISENBAUM:
The goal, really,

69
00:02:42,558 --> 00:02:44,230
is to get people back
into homes and get

70
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,270
students back into schools.

71
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,880
The need here is for manpower.

72
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,300
We need volunteers.

73
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,360
We're going to need
thousands of volunteers

74
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,105
over the course of
the coming years.

75
00:02:54,105 --> 00:02:55,500
- We're going to
have you guys added

76
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,585
in to a team for tomorrow.

77
00:02:57,585 --> 00:02:59,710
DANA TARNO-GERKEN:
These people need a lot,

78
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,170
and they have the
time to give it, so.

79
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,020
It's an incredible gift
that we give and we get.

80
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:10,115


81
00:03:10,115 --> 00:03:12,200
DAVID EISENBAUM:
10 second trivia.

82
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,140
Which of these films won
the very first Academy

83
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,630
Award for Best Picture in 1929?

84
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,540
"Wings", "All Quiet
on the Western Front",

85
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,390
"Grand Hotel", or "It
Happened One Night".

86
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,336


87
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:26,230
Though it was called
Outstanding Picture back then,

88
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,130
the award went to a World
War I drama called Wings.

89
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,600


90
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,740
In last night's Oscars, the 90
second Academy Award ceremony,

91
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,380
it wasn't just results that
the media were watching.

92
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,700
It was the ratings.

93
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,410
With tens of
millions of viewers,

94
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,800
The Oscars are one of, if
not the most watched show

95
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,440
in America that
isn't a sports event.

96
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,690
But in recent years, the
Academy Awards have seen

97
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,670
a decline in TV viewership.

98
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:56,840
They hit an all-time low in
2018 with 26.5 million viewers,

99
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,080
but they bounced back a
bit last year when the show

100
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,850
got 29.6 million viewers.

101
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,580
One thing unique
about last year's show

102
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,400
was that it didn't have a
host, and the Academy planned

103
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,200
to try that again last night.

104
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,880
We didn't have final
viewership numbers

105
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,830
when we put this
show together, so we

106
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,740
don't know if the
host-less approach helped.

107
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,649
But other awards shows in 2020,
like the Golden Globes and

108
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:19,959
the Grammys, saw lower ratings.

109
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,670
Regardless of how
that played out,

110
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,850
the business of nominating
stars, movies, and producers

111
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,214
is a big one.

112
00:04:27,214 --> 00:04:28,810
- In 1929, studio
head Louis B. Mayer

113
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,150
handed out the first
Academy Awards.

114
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,580
There were only 270
guests, the winners

115
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,370
have been announced
months before,

116
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,870
and the whole thing
only cost $5 to attend.

117
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,040
- We've seen the American
motion picture become

118
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,240
foremost in all the world.

119
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,540
- Fast forward 90 years,
and today the Oscars

120
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,840
are awarded at a 3,300 seat
theater, tens of millions

121
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,610
of people watch
the results live,

122
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,070
and tickets cost
hundreds of dollars.

123
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,450
But the biggest difference?

124
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,150
Today's movie studios
spend millions

125
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,183
to convince the Academy that
their films deserve to win.

126
00:05:01,183 --> 00:05:02,650
KYLE BUCHANAN: Sometimes
the amount of money

127
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,570
that a studio will spend
when they're campaigning

128
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,670
for an Oscar is even more
money than the budget

129
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,870
of the movie to begin with.

130
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,580
- That's Kyle Buchanan.

131
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,040
He covers all things Oscars
for the New York Times.

132
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,130
KYLE BUCHANAN: If you want to
get your movie taken seriously,

133
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,000
you've got to spend.

134
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,880
You've got to make sure that
there are ads out there,

135
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,700
that there are events, that
people are contextualizing

136
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,110
you as an Oscar contender.

137
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,900
- And why do studios spend
that much cash for an 8

138
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,400
and 1/2 pound statuette?

139
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,370
For a smaller studio
like A24 or Annapurna,

140
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,500
the answer is pretty obvious.

141
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,970
KYLE BUCHANAN: They're
making movies for, you know,

142
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,350
not a big budget
a lot of the time.

143
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,490
But in order to be seen when
the marketplace is choked

144
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,250
with these big blockbusters
and superhero films,

145
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,590
they need that sort
of extra headline

146
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:47,450
making ability than an
awards season can provide.

147
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,390
- But what about a bigger
studio, like Warner

148
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,890
Brothers or Universal?

149
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,140
As we've seen over the
past couple decades,

150
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,290
box office hits aren't often
considered Oscar contenders,

151
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,270
and blockbusters don't
really need the exposure

152
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,680
that a nomination brings.

153
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,780
Isn't the money
enough of a reward?

154
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,490
KYLE BUCHANAN: The people
who work on these movies

155
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,460
by and large are artists
who want to be appreciated

156
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,010
as artists by other
artists in town,

157
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,070
so when they are in
contention for an Oscar

158
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,360
it means something deeper.

159
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,800
It satisfies them in a
way that money can't only.

160
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,610
- So it's really about
talent acquisition

161
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:19,447
and talent retainment?

162
00:06:19,447 --> 00:06:21,280
KYLE BUCHANAN: Yeah, it's
about making sure that people

163
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,510
are happy, you know.

164
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,320
We see it all the time.

165
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,660
When a star has had
success, and then

166
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,520
they want to do
something more serious.

167
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,790
They want to be understood as
an artist with something to say.

168
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,885
- Is that me?

169
00:06:31,885 --> 00:06:34,510
- When Warner Brothers goes
all in on an Oscar campaign

170
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,720
for Bradley Cooper or Ben
Affleck or Clint Eastwood,

171
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,190
it's not just for
bragging rights,

172
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,540
or even a box office bump.

173
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,150
No, the studio spends that
cash to show commitment

174
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,010
to its stars, and
to keep them coming

175
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,660
back for future projects.

176
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,180
For example, Hollywood's
biggest studio, Disney,

177
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,970
is pushing harder and harder
for its top blockbusters

178
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,260
to be an Oscar contention.

179
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,060
- What next?

180
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,110
- But the race isn't just
between traditional studios

181
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,910
anymore.

182
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,400
So why does something like
Netflix want to win an Oscar?

183
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,650
I mean, it's already
the talk of Hollywood,

184
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,940
it's one of the biggest media
companies on the planet.

185
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,480
Why does it need
the little gold man?

186
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,600
KYLE BUCHANAN: I
think Netflix is

187
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,290
eager to disrupt any industry
it can get its hands on.

188
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,450
You know, they've
already changed the way

189
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,310
that we watch
television, now they

190
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,690
want to do the same for movies.

191
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,870
Just like any studio, they want
to be able to get in the Oscar

192
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,600
race so that top tier
auteurs will come

193
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,430
to them to make movies
instead of the big studios

194
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,230
that are out there.

195
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,300
If they can penetrate
this race, there's really

196
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,280
nothing that Netflix can't do.

197
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,060
They want to upend the idea
of theatrical distribution

198
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,430
being the end all, be
all of seeing a movie.

199
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,920
They want to change the
way you see a movie.

200
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,890
And if they can get
Oscar to validate that,

201
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,630
then they've gotten
almost all the way there.

202
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,590
- The Academy is getting
younger and more diverse,

203
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,820
and its nominees and
winners are shifting, too.

204
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,430
KYLE BUCHANAN: I think
it's good and necessary

205
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,160
to recontextualize what we
think of as an Oscar contender

206
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,670
because it means that a lot of
better movies that have maybe

207
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,100
even historically
overlooked by the season,

208
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,130
but have certainly not been
overlooked by audience members,

209
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,450
can actually get into the race.

210
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,250
- Over the decades,
the Academy Awards

211
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,350
have become bigger,
more expensive,

212
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,990
and maybe a bit more inclusive.

213
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,760
But in the end,
Louis B Mayer started

214
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,610
the awards to flatter stars
into working in his movies.

215
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,020
And today, studios
will spend more

216
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,453
than ever to do just the same.

217
00:08:17,453 --> 00:08:19,320
KYLE BUCHANAN: When it comes
to this town, when it comes

218
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,710
to Hollywood, a lot of
people go into the industry,

219
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,900
or even before they
get into the industry,

220
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,340
they've stood in
front of that mirror.

221
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,990
They've practiced
that Oscar speech.

222
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:31,710
It is still the summit of
this industry in so many ways,

223
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,870
and a lot of people
want that to really

224
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,760
feel like they've picked the
dream that they've always had.

CARL AZUZ: For 10 out of 10,
we present to you, The Starry

229
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,950
Night by Vincent van--

230
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,140
Vincent van-- how do you say it?

231
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,780
He's one of the most well-known
artists in the world,

232
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,630
but an audio guide at a
new exhibition in London

233
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,070
says Van Gogh.

234
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,440
And experts say that's wrong.

235
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,900
Some say it should be
pronounced "van goth",

236
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,570
some say "van gog"
some say "van coch".

237
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,970
This has been a controversy
since the artist was alive,

238
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,790
and that's reportedly part
of the reason why he signed

239
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,543
every painting simply, Vincent.

240
00:09:13,543 --> 00:09:14,810
Who would have thought
the controversy

241
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,750
would still be van going so
long after he'd van gone?

242
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,760
Some might van
scoff at the idea,

243
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,010
some might get the
Impressionism that the debate

244
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:25,160
is better discussed on, let's
say, a cafe terrace at night.

245
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,230
Some will just van go
with what they van know,

246
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:30,080
and you'll never be able to
convince at them otherwise.

247
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,600
Beachwood, sounds like it could
have been one of van Gogh's

248
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,270
paintings, but we wrap
up today with Beachwood

249
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,280
