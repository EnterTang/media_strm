00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,970
CARL AZUZ: This is CNN
10, your daily explanation

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,030
of world news in 10 minutes,
and I'm your host, Carl Azuz.

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,620
Hope your day is going well.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,100
Yesterday did not go well for
international stock markets.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,680
After drops in other
exchanges around the world,

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,130
the US stock markets set a
record, and not a good one.

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,440
The Dow Jones Industrial
Average is an index

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,090
of 30 significant stocks.

11
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,490
It includes companies like
Disney and McDonald's,

12
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,520
and its one major indicator
of how the market as a whole

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,450
is doing.

14
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,330
The Dow dropped so
far, so fast yesterday

15
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,810
that a circuit breaker kicked
in, a temporary stop to trading

16
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,390
to give investors a chance
to catch their breaths.

17
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,040
It lasted 15 minutes.

18
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,390
And when everything
was said and done

19
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,250
with at the end of
the day, the Dow

20
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,850
had lost more than 2000
points, its worst point drop

21
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,160
than on any other
day in history.

22
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,540
What's more important to
investors than points though,

23
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,670
are percentages.

24
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,880
The Dow lost 7.8% of its value.

25
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,520
That's not its biggest
percentage drop ever,

26
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,910
but it was its worst day
since October of 2008

27
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,590
when the great
recession was dragging

28
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,970
down the world economy.

29
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,590
Why did this happen?

30
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,890
Two main reasons.

31
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,650
One of them was oil prices.

32
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,140
They collapsed on Monday
after a disagreement

33
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,590
over oil production between
Saudi Arabia and Russia.

34
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,600
They are two major
producers of oil.

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,230
And though lower oil prices can
translate to lower gas prices,

36
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,360
which many drivers
see as a good thing,

37
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,670
investors don't like
falling oil prices

38
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,920
because they often
correspond with a weakening

39
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,430
global economy.

40
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,180
So this was a big reason why
there was a sell off in the US

41
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,900
stock market yesterday, and that
triggered the circuit breaker.

42
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,000
RICHARD QUEST: It doesn't
matter whether the circuit

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,960
breaker's on an electrical
box or in the stock market.

44
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,450
The concept remains the same.

45
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,430
If there's too much
power, too much

46
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,580
force coming down the pipe,
the circuit breaker kicks in

47
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,425
and everything stops.

48
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:08,479
In 1987 with Black Monday,
the Dow Jones Industrials

49
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,120
fell more than 500 points.

50
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,630
It was a loss of 22.6%.

51
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:18,860
It is still the largest
percentage daily fall

52
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,660
in the Dow's history.

53
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,470
There was a feeling at the
time of financial Armageddon.

54
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,260
The world was coming to an end.

55
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,500
The market decided to put in
place various circuit breakers

56
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,230
so that trading would be slowed.

57
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,660
Those who are in favor
of circuit breakers

58
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,590
say that when properly used
with proper parameters,

59
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:45,683
the circuit breaker merely
allows time for thought.

60
00:02:45,683 --> 00:02:47,650
CARL AZUZ: But there was another
reason for the market dive

61
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,450
yesterday.

62
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,160
And if you've been watching,
you know what I'm about to say,

63
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,330
coronavirus.

64
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,850
According to information put
together by Johns Hopkins

65
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,360
University, more than
113,000 cases have been

66
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,100
confirmed around the world.

67
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,340
Almost 4,000 people who've
caught the virus have died.

68
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,190
That's about 3.5%
of total cases.

69
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:10,030
In more than 62,000 people,
almost 1/2 the total cases

70
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,680
have recovered from the virus.

71
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,750
But the fear of this
disease spreading

72
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,600
has led to school closures
for hundreds of millions

73
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,130
of students around the world.

74
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,680
The nation of Italy, which
has seen the largest outbreak

75
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,250
in Europe, is under lockdown
with schools, movie theaters,

76
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,900
and nightclubs closed.

77
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,840
Ireland has called off its
St. Patrick's Day parades.

78
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,000
Theme parks and museums
have been closed.

79
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,890
Sports events and some
religious gatherings

80
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:33,970
have been called off.

81
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:37,300
The coronavirus outbreak
started in China in December.

82
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,600
And though its spread there
has slowed down in recent days,

83
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,760
it has affected daily
life in Shanghai,

84
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,373
China's most populated city.

85
00:03:44,373 --> 00:03:45,940
DAVID CULVER: In the US
when you're stocking up

86
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,000
for a hurricane, a blizzard,
or a viral outbreak,

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,520
you tend to buy in bulk.

88
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,220
Many Shanghai residents flocking
to China's only Costco location

89
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,300
to do that, and we joined them
for some shopping of our own.

90
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,610
All right, so this is the long
line that's moving, actually,

91
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,170
at a pretty good pace.

92
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,120
We've heard several
announcements

93
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,410
as we've been standing here.

94
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,570
And essentially,
they're telling people,

95
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,360
keep your distance from
the person in front of you.

96
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,310
The store only allows 1000
customers in at a time.

97
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,440
The wait outside?

98
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,880
About 10 minutes.

99
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,680
All right.

100
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,690
We're going in.

101
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,680
So they just told us
to come into this one

102
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,140
line that's clearly going to
take our temperature here.

103
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,240
Carts sanitized one by
one, but some shoppers

104
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,330
adding a layer just to be safe.

105
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,940
All employees, customers
and their little ones

106
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,210
wearing face masks.

107
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,330
Plastic used to protect the
apples from germs and plastic

108
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,670
even used to shield kids.

109
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,350
I can hear there's
a loudspeaker.

110
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,020
Essentially, they're
telling people to keep one

111
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,490
meter apart from each other.

112
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,010
But as you look around,
folks are definitely

113
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,470
getting a lot closer than that.

114
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,820
- [SPEAKING CHINESE]

115
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,560
DAVID CULVER: And if you
did not catch that warning,

116
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,960
this guy will keep you in line.

117
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,790
But there are other
options for folks looking

118
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,560
to avoid stores altogether.

119
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,170
One company launched
this mobile grocery van

120
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,610
before the outbreak.

121
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,640
Since, it's gained
a loyal following,

122
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,350
a mostly older crowd.

123
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,230
You can see the
folks lined up here.

124
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,140
They get, essentially, a menu of
items that they can pick from.

125
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,490
And the idea is, they're
not going into a store.

126
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,610
They're not congregating
with other masses.

127
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:26,290
Instead, they hand off the paper
with what they want, and folks

128
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,380
who are inside do
the preparation

129
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,700
and then pass out their food.

130
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,500
You can check it out.

131
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,470
I mean, it seems to be
pretty popular here.

132
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,150
The company behind it
says, over the course

133
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,540
of a week, the mobile grocery
visits 20 neighborhoods,

134
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,530
serving more than 40,000
Shanghai residents.

135
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,180
The project manager says
they get fresh produce daily

136
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,760
and they make sure it's
all fully sanitized.

137
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,500
But a van can only hold so much.

138
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,380
For shoppers looking for a
taste of normalcy and plenty

139
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:57,860
of options, like pallets of hand
sanitizer, it's back to Costco.

140
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,660
But a warning.

141
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:02,320
If you decide on a cooked meal
here, or a beverage like I did,

142
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,350
it's now it to go purchase only.

143
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,910
They said you would have to eat
and drink everything you buy

144
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,490
in there outside of this store.

145
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,260
Keep your mask on at all times.

146
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,630
They're also telling
folks to get in

147
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,790
and out as quickly as possible.

148
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,140
You don't hear
many stores telling

149
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:21,160
their customers to rush,
but they're doing that here.

150
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,010
An effort to minimize
exposure and to maximize

151
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,570
what you can stock up on.

152
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,060
David Culver, CNN, Shanghai.

153
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,540
CARL AZUZ: 10 second trivia.

154
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,810
The Columbus Panhandles,
Muncie Flyers,

155
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,670
and Rochester Jeffersons
were all teams in what sports

156
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,470
league?

157
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,750
NHL, MLB, NBA, or NFL?

158
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,370
In 1922, when the National
Football League was named,

159
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,750
these were three of its teams.

160
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,440
75 years later, the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers

161
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,590
drafted a Florida State running
back named Warrick Dunn.

162
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,860
And that same year,
it was 1997, Dunn

163
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,890
founded Homes for the
Holidays, a charity he uses

164
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,900
to fulfill his mother's dream.

165
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,880
She'd always wanted
a home of her own.

166
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,740
And when Warrick used
her life insurance

167
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,720
to buy one after she died, he
says his family found hope.

168
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,600
- Just show me that.

169
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,950
WARRICK DUNN: Everyone
deserves a home.

170
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:18,580
Home is where the heart is.

171
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,790
I just remember sitting in a
locker room with Coach Dungy,

172
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:25,450
and just listening to him just
talk to all the rookies about,

173
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,910
you guys want to get
involved, and give back,

174
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,470
and those things?

175
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,020
Then it just came up, my mom.

176
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,490
She was working off duty
when guys ambushed her,

177
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,320
and they just opened
fire on a police car.

178
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,620
My mom lost her life.

179
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,960
I just knew from
that moment that I

180
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,100
couldn't worry about myself.

181
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,140
I needed to worry about
my brothers and sisters.

182
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,770
She was never able to realize
her dream of homeownership.

183
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,700
I just saw the way that she
just cared about people,

184
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,320
and how she wanted her
community to be better.

185
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,510
Homes for the Holidays
is where we go and we

186
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,770
assist a single parent
family who's becoming

187
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,360
a first time homeowner.

188
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,100
So far over the last 21 years,
177 single parent families,

189
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,670
we given $5,000 down
payment, and we fully

190
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,890
furnish their homes with
food, furniture, linens,

191
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:08,580
[INAUDIBLE] TVs, computers, all
the way down to the toothbrush.

192
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,830
First, we were just focused
on really just helping

193
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,300
families get into homes.

194
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,010
The more I really
learned, we wanted

195
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:18,270
to get in the business of
giving people potential to break

196
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,160
their cycle of poverty.

197
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,730
And with that is financial
literacy, health and wellness,

198
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,310
education attainment,
and workforce development

199
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,550
and entrepreneurship.

200
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,070
KIA SAVAGE LEWIS: It
set the foundation.

201
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,530
For me, up until
that point, survival

202
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,390
was my thinking process.

203
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,610
WARRICK DUNN: But the goal is, I
hope we can go out of business.

204
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:38,330
And when I say that, it's,
no one else needs housing.

205
00:08:42,713 --> 00:08:45,148
[MUSIC PLAYING]

206
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,230
CARL AZUZ: We can't say
if the meals offered

207
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,240
by this food truck
are human grade,

208
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,500
but that's kind of the point.

209
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,720
It's a food truck for dogs.

210
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,970
Woof Bowl rolls
around the Virginia

211
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,430
area serving hamburgers,
tacos, donuts,

212
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,900
and drinks, again, for dogs.

213
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,450
The human couple
that runs it say

214
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,190
they wanted to give
fresher, healthier

215
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,800
options to animals than
some dog food and treats

216
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,640
typically provide.

217
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,970
And like other food trucks,
they sometimes sell out.

218
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:13,850
There are Dober-many options,
you could say, poodles of them,

219
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,770
for specialty dog chow chow.

220
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:18,020
Breakfast could be a
Great Dane-ish, a bagel,

221
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,640
or an English muffin mastiff.

222
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,190
For lunch, an Aussie
shepherd meat pie with a bowl

223
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,120
of Yorkshire pudding.

224
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,190
And dinner, try the Char-pei
or Kipper key with the side

225
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,890
of Bichon fries.

226
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,990
Maltese milk and Earl gray
hounds are drink options,

227
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:32,120
and dessert can include a
Boston cream pie terrier

228
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,050
with Labra-snicker doodles.

229
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,090
I'm Carl Azuz.

230
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,040
It's funny that we
ended on dog food,

231
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,010
because it's the Bobcats
of Taylorsville, Utah

232
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:41,600
who made it on today's show.

233
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,330
Bennion Junior High School has
been subscribing and commenting

234
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,600

235
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,090
Follow their example today.

236
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,840
We may say your school tomorrow.
