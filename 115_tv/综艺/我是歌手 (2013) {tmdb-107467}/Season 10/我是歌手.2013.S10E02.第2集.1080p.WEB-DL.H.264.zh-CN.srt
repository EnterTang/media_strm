1
00:00:01,136 --> 00:00:02,615
博伊德：前情提要。
BOYD: Previously on From...

2
00:00:02,657 --> 00:00:04,657
(音乐盒播放)马丁：森林里一片黑暗。
(MUSIC BOX PLAYING) MARTIN: There's darkness in the forest.

3
00:00:04,699 --> 00:00:07,340
你甚至无法想象的噩梦。
Nightmares you can't even begin to imagine.

4
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:10,223
(咕哝，喊叫)
(GRUNTING, SHOUTING)

5
00:00:10,265 --> 00:00:13,028
我的血现在就是你的血。
My blood is your blood now.

6
00:00:16,751 --> 00:00:20,115
每次我看到一些非常奇怪的东西，我都会看到这个符号。
Every time I see something really weird, I see this symbol.

7
00:00:23,078 --> 00:00:24,557
(尖叫声)
(SCREAMS)

8
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:25,798
我见过这个。
I've seen this.

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,600
就像在幻觉里还是别的什么？
Like in a vision or something?

10
00:00:27,642 --> 00:00:29,802
塔比莎：不，是在隧道的墙上。
TABITHA: No, on the walls in the tunnels.

11
00:00:29,844 --> 00:00:32,125
维克多说他的母亲想救孩子们
Victor said his mother wanted to rescue the children

12
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:33,406
被锁在塔里的东西。
that were locked in the tower.

13
00:00:33,448 --> 00:00:35,248
这是让所有人回家的唯一方法。
That it was the only way to get everyone home.

14
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,091
一直以来我都以为孩子们想吓唬我，
All this time I thought the children were trying to scare me,

15
00:00:38,133 --> 00:00:40,373
但如果他们只是寻求我的帮助呢？
but what if they're just asking for my help?

16
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,175
(蝉嗡嗡叫)你听到了吗？
(CICADAS BUZZING) Do you hear that?

17
00:00:42,217 --> 00:00:44,057
帮帮我!
Help me!

18
00:00:44,099 --> 00:00:46,739
请!求求你，我需要帮助！
Please! Please, I need help!

19
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:49,022
她在睡梦中说话。
She was talking in her sleep.

20
00:00:49,064 --> 00:00:50,423
博伊德：她说什么？
BOYD: What did she say?

21
00:00:50,465 --> 00:00:53,228
“他们触摸，他们打破，他们偷窃。
"They touch, they break, they steal.

22
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:55,908
这里没有一个人是自由的。
No one here is free."

23
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,751
博伊德：现在这里有别的东西了。一些新的东西。
BOYD: There's something else here now. Something new.

24
00:00:58,793 --> 00:01:00,833
今晚任何人都不能安全入睡。
It's not safe for anyone to go to sleep tonight.

25
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,195
你们每一个人..。带他上楼！
Every one of you... Get him upstairs!

26
00:01:02,237 --> 00:01:04,317
...他妈的要死了！马上把他弄出去！
...is gonna fucking die! Get him outta here now!

27
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:05,878
埃尔金：我刚刚想起我的梦。
ELGIN: I just remembered my dream.

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,202
有一个穿着白色衣服的男孩，
There was this boy all dressed in white,

29
00:01:09,244 --> 00:01:11,606
他不停地重复同一句话。
and he kept repeating the same phrase.

30
00:01:12,807 --> 00:01:13,966
“他们来了……
"Here they come...

31
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:15,488
(蝉嗡嗡作响)“……他们来找三个人，
(CICADAS BUZZING) "...they come for three,

32
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,650
“除非你停止旋律。”
"unless you stop the melody."

33
00:01:17,692 --> 00:01:19,532
(哽咽)
(CHOKING)

34
00:01:19,574 --> 00:01:20,613
巴克塔：我知道这一点。
BAKTA: I know that one.

35
00:01:20,655 --> 00:01:22,135
这是一首古老的童谣。
It's an old nursery rhyme.

36
00:01:22,177 --> 00:01:23,656
(尖叫)“他们接触，他们打破，
(SCREAMING) "They touch, they break,

37
00:01:23,698 --> 00:01:27,660
“他们偷窃，这里没有一个人是自由的。
"they steal, no one here is free.

38
00:01:27,702 --> 00:01:31,264
“他们来了，他们三个人来了，
"Here they come, they come for three,

39
00:01:31,306 --> 00:01:32,785
“除非你停止旋律。”
"unless you stop the melody."

40
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:33,906
朱莉！停止播放!(尖叫声)
Julie! Stop! (SCREAMING)

41
00:01:33,948 --> 00:01:35,950
(尖叫声)
(SCREAMING)

42
00:01:38,072 --> 00:01:40,675
(蝉嗡嗡作响)
(CICADAS BUZZING)

43
00:01:51,726 --> 00:01:53,728
他们在楼上。
They're upstairs.

44
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:56,331
(关门)
(DOOR CLOSING)

45
00:02:03,418 --> 00:02:05,420
你妈妈和..。
Your mom and...

46
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:09,103
维克多带伊森去了餐厅。
Victor took Ethan to the diner.

47
00:02:12,227 --> 00:02:13,786
嘿，呃，博伊德...
Hey, uh, Boyd...

48
00:02:13,828 --> 00:02:15,830
你应该上楼去，以防他们需要你的帮助。
You should go upstairs just in case they need your help.

49
00:02:30,725 --> 00:02:32,727
(蝉嗡嗡作响)
(CICADAS BUZZING)

50
00:02:38,213 --> 00:02:41,574
那孩子应该选一件舞会礼服，
That kid should be picking out a prom dress,

51
00:02:41,616 --> 00:02:44,539
而不是躺在那里就像..。
not laying in there like...

52
00:02:46,821 --> 00:02:49,023
问题是有太多我们不知道的东西。
The problem is there's too much we don't know.

53
00:02:51,306 --> 00:02:53,546
这就像翻开一本书，从中间开始
It's like opening a book and starting from the middle

54
00:02:53,588 --> 00:02:56,909
或者试着想象拼图是什么样子的
or trying to imagine what a jigsaw puzzle looks like

55
00:02:56,951 --> 00:02:59,192
当你所拥有的只是一些随机的碎片，对吗？
when all you have is a few random pieces, right?

56
00:02:59,234 --> 00:03:01,754
甚至是那些有用的东西，比如角或边。
And not even the helpful ones, like corners or edges.

57
00:03:01,796 --> 00:03:05,240
只是他妈的含糊其辞。
Just vague fucking...

58
00:03:07,722 --> 00:03:09,924
诀窍是你找到了两个相连的部分。
The trick is you find two pieces that connect.

59
00:03:12,367 --> 00:03:14,369
那么至少你有了一个开始的地方。
Then at least you have a place to start.

60
00:03:16,251 --> 00:03:18,253
(蝉嗡嗡作响)
(CICADAS BUZZING)

61
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,860
嘿，嘿。你们打算去哪儿?
Hey, hey. Where are you going?

62
00:03:27,902 --> 00:03:29,904
我们要和莎拉谈谈。
We need to talk to Sara.

63
00:03:30,305 --> 00:03:33,428
(蝉嗡嗡作响)
(CICADAS BUZZING)

64
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,552
(引擎隆隆作响)
(ENGINE RUMBLES)

65
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:41,836
(刹车发出尖叫声)
(BRAKES SQUEALING)

66
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:49,842
好吧，如果我们再也睡不着了，那还有什么意义？
Well, if we can't sleep anymore, then what's the point?

67
00:03:49,884 --> 00:03:51,884
我告诉你，我们他妈的都该走了。
I'm telling you, we should all just fucking go.

68
00:03:51,926 --> 00:03:54,247
拿些补给，出发，看看我们能找到什么。
Get some supplies, set out, and see what we can find.

69
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:55,768
博伊德已经试过了。
Boyd tried that already.

70
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,610
是啊，也许博伊德不是一切的终结，
Yeah, well, maybe Boyd isn't the end-all,

71
00:03:57,652 --> 00:03:59,212
无所不能，无所不能。
be-all answer to everything.

72
00:03:59,254 --> 00:04:00,653
(叹息)
(SIGHS)

73
00:04:00,695 --> 00:04:02,895
我们到底在这里做什么？兰德尔是个混蛋。
What are we even doing out here? Randall was an asshole.

74
00:04:02,937 --> 00:04:04,457
是啊，你也是个混蛋，
Yeah, well, you're an asshole, too,

75
00:04:04,499 --> 00:04:06,539
我不会把你留在这里等着腐烂。
and I wouldn't leave you out here to rot.

76
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:07,740
啊，我操。
Aw, fuck me.

77
00:04:07,782 --> 00:04:09,422
终于离开我那该死的房间了
Finally get out of my goddamn room

78
00:04:09,464 --> 00:04:12,265
我在执行收集身体的任务。
and I'm on corpse-collecting duty.

79
00:04:12,307 --> 00:04:14,227
去看看下面的情况。
Go check out down there.

80
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:16,271
埃尔金，这边走。
Elgin, this way.

81
00:04:17,512 --> 00:04:18,991
感谢您的光临。
Appreciate you coming.

82
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:20,633
做一些有用的事情感觉很好。
It feels good to do something useful.

83
00:04:20,675 --> 00:04:21,914
哦，你做的已经够多了。
Oh, you've done plenty.

84
00:04:21,956 --> 00:04:23,316
你的梦想，
That dream of yours,

85
00:04:23,358 --> 00:04:26,479
就我们所知，这将被证明是这个问题的答案。
for all we know that'll prove to be the answer to this.

86
00:04:26,521 --> 00:04:28,681
听起来很奇怪。
Weird as that fucking sounds.

87
00:04:28,723 --> 00:04:30,725
是啊，也许吧。
Yeah, maybe.

88
00:04:31,766 --> 00:04:33,768
戴尔：你会想看看这个的！
DALE: You're gonna want to see this!

89
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:40,373
我不认为这家伙已经死了。
I don't think this guy's dead.

90
00:04:40,415 --> 00:04:42,417
哦，见鬼。
Oh, shit.

91
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,179
操。
Fuck.

92
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:48,821
噢。
Oh.

93
00:04:48,863 --> 00:04:51,223
你不是说这里会有死掉的怪物吗？
Didn't you say there'd be dead monsters out here?

94
00:04:51,265 --> 00:04:52,985
(呼气)
(EXHALES)

95
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:55,029
银弹到此为止。
So much for silver bullets.

96
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,630
嗯。把他抬上车。
Yeah. Get him in the van.

97
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,831
哦，妈的。
Aw, fuck.

98
00:04:58,873 --> 00:05:00,875
把他抬上车！好吧。
Get him in the van! Okay.

Her pulse is nice and strong

103
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:13,728
她深吸了一口气。
and she's taking big, deep breaths.

104
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:17,211
让我们看看这个。
Let's see here.

105

哦，发生什么事了？我不知道!
Oh, what's happening? I don't know!

00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:24,817
到底怎么回事？
What's going on?

发生什么事了呢？我不.。我不知道!
What's happening? I don't... I don't know!

109

146
00:07:49,243 --> 00:07:51,724
莎拉：那么，这应该有什么帮助呢？
SARA: So, how is this supposed to help?

147
00:07:51,766 --> 00:07:53,285
博伊德：当我们在森林里时，
BOYD: When we were in the forest,

148
00:07:53,327 --> 00:07:56,328
你说一个穿白衣服的小男孩叫你上树去。
you said a little boy in white told you to get into the tree.

149
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,931
就是那棵树让我进了那个该死的房间
It's the same tree that put me in the goddamn chamber

150
00:07:58,973 --> 00:08:00,773
这一切都是从那里开始的。
where all this started.

151
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:02,495
莎拉：所以...
SARA: So...

152
00:08:02,537 --> 00:08:05,498
博伊德：嗯，原来埃尔金做了一个梦，梦到一个穿白衣服的小男孩。
BOYD: Well, it turns out Elgin had a dream about a little boy in white.

153
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,379
给他讲了一段童谣。
Told him part of a nursery rhyme.

154
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:11,223
保拉在死前一直重复的那句话。
The same one Paula kept repeating before she died.

155
00:08:11,265 --> 00:08:14,066
“他们触摸，他们打破，他们偷窃，
"They touch, they break, they steal,

156
00:08:14,108 --> 00:08:16,068
“这里没有一个人是自由的。
"no one here is free.

157
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,750
“他们来了，他们三个人来了，
"Here they come, they come for three,

158
00:08:17,792 --> 00:08:19,792
“除非你停止旋律。”
"unless you stop the melody."

159
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:22,595
你觉得这有什么意义吗？
That make any sense to you?

160
00:08:22,637 --> 00:08:24,997
不是的。
No.

161
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,522
关于那个小男孩你还有什么能告诉我的吗？
Anything else you can tell me about the little boy?

162
00:08:28,763 --> 00:08:30,765
他是想帮我们。
He was trying to help us.

163
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:35,207
好的，所以这个随机的小孩子跑来跑去
Okay, so this random little kid is running around

164
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:37,730
一个神奇的森林做得好吗？
a magical forest doing good?

165
00:08:37,772 --> 00:08:39,652
突然出现在人们的梦里然后..。
Popping up in people's dreams and...

166
00:08:39,694 --> 00:08:41,696
我不认为他真的是个小男孩。
I don't think he really was a little boy.

167
00:08:42,496 --> 00:08:43,896

现在就是这样。
This is it right now.

170
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:50,302
当我告诉你你仍然有机会
When I told you there was a chance that you could still

171
00:08:50,344 --> 00:08:52,386
做些好事，这样你就可以帮助这里的人们。
do some good, that you could help the people here...

172
00:08:53,628 --> 00:08:55,868
就在现在，
It's right now,

好的。就是这个。

就在这里有人被锁在墙上。
There was someone chained to a wall right here.

180
00:09:20,735 --> 00:09:22,294
就在这里。然后就有了一个洞
Right here. Then there was a hole

181
00:09:22,336 --> 00:09:24,336
它下降了40，50英尺。
that went down 40, 50 feet.

182
00:09:24,378 --> 00:09:26,380
然后我有了..。
And I had...

183
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:29,501

我能听到。

你说什么呢？
What are you talking about?

188
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,590

(呼吸不稳定)
(BREATHING UNSTEADILY)

199

把枪拿去，锁在棚子里。

280
00:13:46,921 --> 00:13:49,643
我一直梦见一座塔..。
the dreams I've been having about a tower...

281
00:13:51,685 --> 00:13:54,246
如果她是对的呢？
What if she was right?

282
00:13:54,288 --> 00:13:57,449
如果救朱莉的唯一办法就是找到那座塔呢？
What if the only way to save Julie is to find that tower?

283
00:13:57,491 --> 00:13:58,530
猫。
Tabby...

284
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:00,092
亲爱的我知道我知道这听起来很疯狂。
Honey, I know, I know it sounds crazy.

285
00:14:00,134 --> 00:14:01,693
我对这个地方有一个理论
I had a theory about this place

286
00:14:01,735 --> 00:14:03,737
差点害死我。
that almost got me killed.

287
00:14:04,258 --> 00:14:05,537
好吧，这是不同的。
Well, this is different.

288
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,581
多么?
How?

289
00:14:09,623 --> 00:14:10,662
就是这样。
It just is.

290
00:14:10,704 --> 00:14:12,144
(嘲讽)
(SCOFFS)

291
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:13,946
吉姆，我们的女儿躺在那个房间里
Jim, our daughter is laying in that room

292
00:14:13,988 --> 00:14:15,990
就像从噩梦中走出来的东西。
like something out of a nightmare.

293
00:14:17,511 --> 00:14:19,513
她昨晚打电话找我，
She called for me last night,

294
00:14:20,554 --> 00:14:22,877
而我却什么也帮不了她。
and I couldn't do anything to help her.

295
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,281
我只是站在那里。
I was just standing there...

296
00:14:28,802 --> 00:14:31,043
我所能想到和看到的就是
And all I could think and see was

297
00:14:31,085 --> 00:14:33,287
托马斯躺在该死的地板上。
Thomas lying on the fucking floor.

298
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:36,931
我不能。我不能，吉姆。
I can't. I can't, Jim.

299
00:14:40,294 --> 00:14:42,736
我们不能坐在这里做最好的打算。
We can't sit here hoping for the best.

300
00:14:46,981 --> 00:14:48,620
维克多的母亲离开了这个地方
Victor's mother left this place,

301
00:14:48,662 --> 00:14:50,664
然后她就再也没有回来。
and she never came back.

302
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:56,308
无论她去做什么，她都再也没有回来。
Whatever she went to do, she never came back.

303
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,150
(呼吸不稳定)
(BREATHING UNSTEADILY)

304
00:14:58,192 --> 00:15:01,073
维克多不得不一个人在这里长大。
Victor had to grow up here alone.

305
00:15:01,115 --> 00:15:02,875
如果这种事发生在你身上怎么办？
What if that happens to you?

306
00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:04,919
我知道呀。
I know.

307
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:10,804
这就是为什么我需要你告诉我我可以走了。
That's why I need you to tell me that it's okay for me to go.

308
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:14,888
我一定要试一试，吉姆。请。
I have to try this, Jim. Please.

309
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:20,132
当Julie醒来的时候，她会饿的。
When Julie wakes up, she's gonna be hungry.

310
00:15:20,174 --> 00:15:22,174
我们让她最喜欢吃。
We make her favourite.

311
00:15:22,216 --> 00:15:23,615
嘿。我们把食物带回家。
Hey. We brought home food.

312
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:25,137
哦，太好了。
Oh, good.

313
00:15:25,179 --> 00:15:28,860
嗯，维克多，我能和你说几句话吗？
Um, Victor, can I talk to you for a minute, please?

314
00:15:28,902 --> 00:15:30,904
维克多有麻烦了吗？
Is Victor in trouble?

315
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:33,025
不，不。
No, no.

316
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:35,069
你来帮我。
You come help me.

317
00:15:41,155 --> 00:15:42,955
呃..。
Uh...

318
00:15:42,997 --> 00:15:45,157
你说你母亲想救孩子们
You said your mother wanted to rescue the children

319
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,201
被锁在塔里的东西。
that were locked in the tower.

320
00:15:51,605 --> 00:15:53,607
你知道去塔楼的路吗？
Do you know the way to the tower?

321
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,331
嗯。
Mm.

322
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:03,936
但是我..。我认识这条路
But I... I know the way

323
00:16:03,978 --> 00:16:05,497
到瓶子树那里。
to the bottle tree.

324
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:07,541
什么？
The what?

325
00:16:08,102 --> 00:16:10,104
(叹息)
(SIGHS)

326
00:16:13,587 --> 00:16:17,231
(喃喃低语)
(MURMURING)

327
00:16:21,675 --> 00:16:23,475
这就是你去塔楼的路。
This is how you get to the tower.

328
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:27,321
你.。你一定要去参观瓶子树。
You... You have to visit the bottle tree.

329
00:16:31,445 --> 00:16:33,447
你能带我去那里吗？
Can you take me there?

330
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:36,288
我也这么想。
I think so.

331
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,332
你能给我们一点时间吗？
Can you give us a second?

332
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:49,783
吉姆，我得尝尝这个。
Jim, I have to try this.

333
00:16:53,107 --> 00:16:55,109
我至少得试一试。
I have to at least try.

334
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,394
我只是.。
I just...

335
00:17:01,555 --> 00:17:05,359
我知道呀。我知道呀。我知道，宝贝。我知道呀。
I know. I know. I know, baby. I know.

336
00:17:07,081 --> 00:17:09,083
(呼气)
(EXHALES)

337
00:17:14,048 --> 00:17:16,210
(抽泣)
(SOBBING)

338
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:19,411
那么，我们该怎么办呢？
So, what are we supposed to do?

339
00:17:19,453 --> 00:17:21,575
(蝉嗡嗡作响)
(CICADAS BUZZING)

340
00:17:24,498 --> 00:17:26,500
我们回镇上去。
We head back to town.

341
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,021
等等，什么？
Wait, wait, wait, what?

342
00:17:29,063 --> 00:17:31,343
她刚说音乐盒在这里。
She just said that the music box is here.

343
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:33,105
它就在这里。我们必须找到它，我们必须..。
It's here. We have to find it, we have to...

344
00:17:33,147 --> 00:17:34,666
是啊，你想让我们怎么做？
Yeah, how do you expect we do that?

345
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,228
我不知道,
I don't know,

346
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:39,351
但我敢肯定，这不是通过回到镇上！
but I'm pretty sure it's not by going back into town!

347
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:41,473
这里的人的生命危在旦夕！
People's lives are at stake here!

348
00:17:41,515 --> 00:17:43,797
嘿，我不需要他妈的提醒我什么是危险！
Hey, I don't need a fucking reminder of what's at stake!

349
00:17:48,802 --> 00:17:52,284
我们在这里无能为力。还没。
There's nothing we can do here. Not yet.

350
00:17:52,326 --> 00:17:55,929
听着，我们正在处理的事情超出了我们的范围……
Look, we're dealing with things that are beyond our scope of...

351
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:02,013
我们现在知道的比今天早上知道的要多。
We know more now than we knew this morning.

352
00:18:02,055 --> 00:18:03,095
这是一场胜利。
That's a win.

353
00:18:03,137 --> 00:18:04,216
好吧。
Okay.

354
00:18:04,258 --> 00:18:06,260
嗯。那么，我们在做什么.
Yeah. So, what are we...

355
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,301
我们该怎么跟人们说？
What are we supposed to tell people?

356
00:18:09,343 --> 00:18:11,183
我们告诉人们，我们正在努力解决这个问题。
We tell people that we are working on it.

357
00:18:11,225 --> 00:18:14,066
我们现在能做的最好的事情就是帮助人们
The best thing we can do now is help people

358
00:18:14,108 --> 00:18:16,548
感觉更平静一点。
feel a little more calmer.

359
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,870
让他们感觉不那么害怕。
Help 'em feel less afraid.

360
00:18:18,912 --> 00:18:20,914
你能做到吗？
Can you do that?

361
00:18:22,516 --> 00:18:24,476
嗯。
Yeah.

362
00:18:24,518 --> 00:18:26,037
嗯。
Yeah.

363
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,199
好人。
Good man.

364
00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:29,683
(蝉嗡嗡作响)
(CICADAS BUZZING)

365
00:18:31,685 --> 00:18:33,687
(人们在含糊地聊天)
(PEOPLE CHATTING INDISTINCTLY)

366
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,132
嘿。
Hey.

367
00:18:40,694 --> 00:18:42,696
你还好吗？
You all right?

368
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:46,460
为什么人们总是在答案显而易见的时候问这个问题？
Why do people always ask that when the answer's obvious?

369
00:18:50,944 --> 00:18:53,985
听着，伙计，昨晚的事我很抱歉。
Look, man, I'm sorry about last night.

370
00:18:54,027 --> 00:18:56,108
把你放在那个房间里，我们只是想...
Putting you in that room, we were just trying to...

371
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,152
这是我的错。
It was my fault.

372
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:02,196
我的狗屎不见了。
I lost my shit.

373
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:07,281
宝拉是那个在危机中表现出色的人。
Paula was the one who was good in a crisis.

374
00:19:11,965 --> 00:19:14,288
我从未意识到我们是多么脆弱。
I never realised how fragile we are.

375
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,212
我们是多么容易就打破了。
How easily we break.

376
00:19:21,415 --> 00:19:24,137
我在楼下像个白痴一样做饭。
I was downstairs making dinner like an idiot.

377
00:19:29,383 --> 00:19:31,385
你也无能为力。
There was nothing you could've done.

378
00:19:32,626 --> 00:19:34,628
这不是任何人的错。
This was nobody's fault.

379
00:19:38,872 --> 00:19:40,874
嗯。
Yeah.

380
00:19:41,395 --> 00:19:43,235
这不是任何人的错。
Nobody's fault.

381
00:19:43,277 --> 00:19:45,279
嗯。
Yeah.

382
00:19:52,726 --> 00:19:54,728
他怎么样了？
How's he doing?

383
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,573
我只是无法想象如果发生这样的事情我会怎么做。
I just can't imagine what I'd do if something like that...

384
00:20:01,695 --> 00:20:03,697
如果是你的话。(呼气)
If it was you. (EXHALES)

385
00:20:08,302 --> 00:20:09,421
(叹息)
(SIGHS)

386
00:20:09,463 --> 00:20:11,465
嘿，过来。
Hey, come here.

387
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,594
不是我干的。
It wasn't me.

388
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:26,800
我们结婚吧。
Let's get married.

389
00:20:27,521 --> 00:20:28,560
今天。
Today.

390
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,961
(咯咯笑)是的。
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

391
00:20:30,003 --> 00:20:31,963
听着，我们不知道会发生什么，
Look, we have no idea what's gonna happen,

392
00:20:32,005 --> 00:20:34,288
或者你爸爸会不会想办法...
or if your dad's gonna find a way to...

393
00:20:39,853 --> 00:20:41,132
(咯咯地笑)
(CHUCKLES)

394
00:20:41,174 --> 00:20:43,577
如果这就是结束，那么我希望这一切和你一起结束。
If this is the end, then I want it to end with you.

395
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,702
我想结婚。
I wanna get married.

396
00:20:54,227 --> 00:20:55,347
好吧。
Okay.

397
00:20:55,389 --> 00:20:56,468
好吧?
Okay?

398
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,912
(笑)好的，好的，当然。嗯。
(LAUGHS) Okay, yeah, sure. Yeah.

(呼气)
(EXHALES)

406
00:21:43,076 --> 00:21:45,078
这就是你在我的酒吧里做的事？
So, this is what you're doing with my bar?

407
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,999
这是一个思维实验。
It's a thought experiment.

408
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,200
阿。
Ah.

409
00:21:49,242 --> 00:21:50,642
我以前觉得这很有帮助
I used to find this helpful

410
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,686
当我发展我的，嗯.
when I was developing my, um...

411
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,729
你死了。
You died.

412
00:21:57,771 --> 00:21:59,773
对，是这样。
Correct.

413
00:22:00,253 --> 00:22:01,693
好吧。
Okay.

414
00:22:01,735 --> 00:22:04,137
好吧，只是想确认一下我们的想法是一致的。
Well, just wanted to make sure we were on the same page.

415
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,182
(呼出重气)
(EXHALES HEAVILY)

416
00:22:15,228 --> 00:22:18,350
你不问我是不是真的吗？
Well, aren't you gonna ask me if I'm real?

417
00:22:18,392 --> 00:22:21,353
我想这是某种由压力引起的精神错乱，
I imagine this is some sort of stress-induced psychosis,

418
00:22:21,395 --> 00:22:23,397
你很快就会消失
and you will disappear soon enough

419
00:22:23,957 --> 00:22:25,877
靠你自己。
on your own.

420
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,039
那么这一切到底是要做什么呢？
So what's all this supposed to do?

421
00:22:28,081 --> 00:22:30,121
这是一种重新定位我的视角的方式。
It's a way of reorienting my perspective.

422
00:22:30,163 --> 00:22:31,963
我在试着..。
I'm trying to...

423
00:22:32,005 --> 00:22:36,448
试图找到一种不同的方式来看待这个符号。
Trying to find a different way to look at this symbol.

424
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,129
为什么？
Why?

425
00:22:38,171 --> 00:22:40,173
(叹息)为什么.
(SIGHS) Why...

426
00:22:42,175 --> 00:22:44,696
因为我一直看错了。
Because I've been looking at it wrong.

427
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,740
(呼气)
(EXHALES)

428
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,060
一定有答案的，我只是..。
There's gotta be an answer here, I'm just...

429
00:22:49,102 --> 00:22:51,104
我看不出来。
I'm not seeing it.

430
00:22:52,866 --> 00:22:54,868
(叹息)
(SIGHS)

431
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,632
你知道我只是在想..。
You know I just thought...

432
00:22:58,992 --> 00:23:01,072
什么？那是什么？
What? What is it?

433
00:23:01,114 --> 00:23:03,274
你换了蒸馏器。
You changed the still.

434
00:23:03,316 --> 00:23:05,318
不用谢。
You're welcome.

435
00:23:08,321 --> 00:23:10,323
我觉得你想得太多了。
I think you're overthinking it.

436
00:23:12,005 --> 00:23:14,808
哦，是吗，死去的汤姆？
Oh, do you, dead Tom?

437
00:23:15,969 --> 00:23:17,969
以什么方式？嗯？
In what way? Hmm?

438
00:23:18,011 --> 00:23:20,331
你已经知道你要做什么了。
You already know what you have to do.

439
00:23:20,373 --> 00:23:23,417
塔比莎告诉过你她在隧道里看到了这个符号。
Tabitha told you she saw this symbol down in the tunnels.

440
00:23:24,217 --> 00:23:25,537
问题是，
The question is,

441
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:27,499
你愿意在多大程度上去寻找答案？
how far are you willing to go to find answers?

442
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:29,743
下到那些地道里去简直是疯了。
Going down into those tunnels would be insane.

443
00:23:31,264 --> 00:23:32,624
即使它救了朱莉的命？
Even if it saves Julie's life?

444
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:34,586
哦，操。
Oh, fuck.

445
00:23:34,628 --> 00:23:37,148
你知道吗，我甚至不知道我会不会在下面找到任何东西！
You know, I don't even know if I'd find anything down there!

446
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,192
你当然知道。这是自然的设计。
Of course you do. It's natural design.

447
00:23:40,393 --> 00:23:42,874
同样的原因你的大脑在你的头骨里，
Same reason your brain's in your skull,

448
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:44,918
你的心脏在肋骨后面。
your heart's behind your ribs.

449
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:47,479
大自然会永远把最珍贵的东西
Nature will always put what's most precious

450
00:23:47,521 --> 00:23:49,523
在最难到达的地方。
in the spots most difficult to reach.

451
00:23:50,403 --> 00:23:54,125
这地方没有一样东西是天然的。
Nothing about this place is natural.

452
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:55,487
不对。
Wrong.

453
00:23:55,529 --> 00:23:57,531
这地方一点都不熟悉。
Nothing about this place is familiar.

454
00:23:59,332 --> 00:24:00,572
这是有区别的。
There's a difference.

455
00:24:00,614 --> 00:24:02,293
(呼出重气)
(EXHALES HEAVILY)

456
00:24:02,335 --> 00:24:04,337
如果有答案的话..。
If there's answers to be found...

457
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:10,542
当然，这是一个..。这是一个很大的假设，
And granted, that's a... That's a big if,

458
00:24:10,584 --> 00:24:11,903
他们就会在那里。
that's where they'll be.

459
00:24:11,945 --> 00:24:13,745
好吧，那我该怎么做？
All right, so I'm supposed to what?

460
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:15,789
我应该听取一些人的建议。
I'm supposed to take advice from some...

461
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:20,391
你撞上了一座正在倒塌的房子
You ran into a house that was falling down

462
00:24:20,433 --> 00:24:22,113
拯救塔比莎
to save Tabitha

463
00:24:22,155 --> 00:24:24,355
而她甚至都不在那里。
and she wasn't even there.

464
00:24:24,397 --> 00:24:25,877
你知道吗？
And you know what?

465
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,720
如果可以选择，我会再次做同样的事情。
Given the choice, I'd do the same thing again.

466
00:24:28,762 --> 00:24:31,162
那你就是个他妈的白痴。就像.。
Well, then you're a fucking idiot. Like...

467
00:24:31,204 --> 00:24:32,604
(笑)
(LAUGHS)

468
00:24:32,646 --> 00:24:35,048
(两人都笑了)
(BOTH LAUGHING)

469
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,450
你不会在道德上做出选择
You don't make moral choices based

470
00:24:38,492 --> 00:24:41,132
关于你所期望的结果。
on the outcomes you expect.

471
00:24:41,174 --> 00:24:43,777
你根据你是否认为它们是正确的来制作它们。
You make them based on whether or not you think they're right.

472
00:24:45,338 --> 00:24:48,019
当我跑进那所房子的时候，我没有想过
When I ran into that house, I wasn't thinking

473
00:24:48,061 --> 00:24:51,024
关于电车问题，或者决定论，或者...
about the Trolley Problem, or determinism, or...

474
00:24:52,025 --> 00:24:54,027
我根本没想过这些。
Wasn't thinking of any of that.

475
00:24:55,228 --> 00:24:58,151
那边有个16岁的女孩需要你的帮助。
There's a 16-year-old girl over there who needs your help.

476
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:06,800
你埋葬宝拉了吗？
Did you bury Paula?

477
00:25:09,923 --> 00:25:11,643
什么？
What?

478
00:25:11,685 --> 00:25:13,687
你埋葬宝拉了吗？
Did you bury Paula yet?

479
00:25:14,608 --> 00:25:16,367
上帝啊。
Jesus Christ.

480
00:25:16,409 --> 00:25:17,448
我会去做的。
I'll do it.

481
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,573
我去找几个人来帮忙。
I'll go and find some people to help.

482
00:25:28,582 --> 00:25:30,301
博伊德？
Boyd?

483
00:25:30,343 --> 00:25:31,823
嗯。
Yeah.

484
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:33,867
你已经尽你所能了。
You're doing the best you can.

485
00:25:41,354 --> 00:25:43,516
(门打开)
(DOOR OPENING)

486
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,882
操他妈的！
Fuck it!

487
00:25:51,765 --> 00:25:54,167
(铃声叮当)
(BELL CLANGING)

488
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,092
(叮当作响)
(CLANGING)

489
00:26:10,263 --> 00:26:11,783
你要把枪收起来吗？
You putting the guns away?

490
00:26:11,825 --> 00:26:14,345
嗯。唐娜担心把它们留在家里。
Yeah. Donna was worried about leaving them in the house.

491
00:26:14,387 --> 00:26:16,908
不，这很聪明。你需要帮忙吗？
No, it's smart. You need a hand?

492
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,952
不，我就快做完了。
No, I'm just about done.

493
00:26:20,073 --> 00:26:21,352
(咕噜声)
(GRUNTS)

494
00:26:21,394 --> 00:26:22,874
(哽咽)
(CHOKING)

495
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:23,955
没关系的。(嘘)
It's okay. (SHUSHING)

496
00:26:23,997 --> 00:26:25,516
没关系的。没关系的。
It's okay. It's okay.

497
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:28,201
你只是要比我们其他人走得早一点。
You're just gonna go a little sooner than the rest of us.

498
00:26:38,852 --> 00:26:40,854
一切都是一个系统。
Everything's a system.

499
00:26:41,374 --> 00:26:43,376
一切都是相互关联的。
Everything's connected.

500
00:26:51,905 --> 00:26:54,067
(深呼吸)
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

501
00:26:57,711 --> 00:26:59,951
一切都会好起来的。
Everything's gonna be fine.

502
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,995
一切都会好起来的。
Everything's gonna be fine.

503
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:04,557
他妈的我的生活。
Fuck my life.

504
00:27:08,201 --> 00:27:10,203
(倒吸一口气)
(GASPS)

505
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:19,452
(深呼吸)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

506
00:27:53,366 --> 00:27:55,166
不，不，不！(轻敲手电筒)
No, no, no, no, no, no! (TAPPING FLASHLIGHT)

507
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:57,250
他妈的狗屎！赶快!
Fucking piece of shit! Come on!

508
00:27:58,732 --> 00:28:01,174
(深呼吸)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

509
00:28:05,498 --> 00:28:07,500
(生物尖叫)
(CREATURE SCREAMS)

510
00:28:10,383 --> 00:28:13,306
(呼吸颤抖)
(BREATHING SHAKILY)

511
00:28:29,562 --> 00:28:31,564
好吧。
Okay.

512
00:28:32,005 --> 00:28:34,007
好的，我来处理。
Okay, I got this.

513
00:28:34,487 --> 00:28:36,489
很简单。
Easy peasy.

514
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,412
太他妈的容易了。
Easy fucking peasy.

515
00:28:45,618 --> 00:28:47,620
(车门吱吱作响)
(DOOR CREAKS)

516
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:10,083
上面有人吗？
Anybody up there?

517
00:29:13,686 --> 00:29:15,688
告诉你吧。
Tell you what...

518
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:19,292
如果你在上面..。
If you are up there...

519
00:29:20,854 --> 00:29:23,136
你真他妈是个混蛋，你知道吗？
You're a real fucking asshole, you know that?

520
00:29:25,218 --> 00:29:27,220
你喜欢这样吗？
You enjoying this?

521
00:29:35,789 --> 00:29:39,272
如果哈特里在这里，哈特里会说，
If Khatri were here, Khatri would say,

522
00:29:40,593 --> 00:29:43,074
“上帝以神秘的方式行动。”
"God moves in mysterious ways."

523
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:46,519
哦，对，对，因为哈特里有个计划。
Oh, yeah, yeah, 'cause Khatri had a plan.

524
00:29:48,281 --> 00:29:52,884
他认为你把他放在这里是有原因的。他.。
He thought you put him here for a reason. He...

525
00:29:52,926 --> 00:29:55,286
他以为我们会走进那片树林
He thought that we were gonna walk out into those woods

526
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:58,369
就像布奇·卡西迪和他妈的圣丹斯小子！
like Butch Cassidy and the motherfucking Sundance Kid!

527
00:29:58,411 --> 00:30:00,211
他一直这么想，直到那个时候
He thought that right up until the time

528
00:30:00,253 --> 00:30:02,976
其中一个割断了他该死的喉咙！
one of those things slit his fucking throat!

529
00:30:04,017 --> 00:30:06,139
他最后一口气做了什么？
What did he do with his last breaths?

530
00:30:08,101 --> 00:30:10,103
他祈祷了。
He prayed.

531
00:30:13,466 --> 00:30:17,028
他喘着气说出了那个该死的祈祷
He gasped out that fucking prayer

532
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,072
这样你就会知道。
so that you would know.

533
00:30:21,274 --> 00:30:26,077
这样他就能向你表明他从未失去信心。
So that he could show you that he had never lost faith.

534
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:28,121
你知道吗，混蛋？
You know what, motherfucker?

535
00:30:29,362 --> 00:30:32,123
我不是来祈祷的。
I ain't here to pray.

536
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:36,207
如果你不是什么睡前故事的话
If you are anything other than some bedtime fucking story

537
00:30:36,249 --> 00:30:40,211
我们告诉自己，然后你会告诉我为什么！
that we tell ourselves, then you will tell me why!

538
00:30:40,253 --> 00:30:44,095
为什么你让我觉得我可以解决这件事？
Why you made me think I could fix this?

539
00:30:44,137 --> 00:30:47,939
某个他妈的英雄会把这些人带回家
Some kind of fucking hero gonna lead these people home,

540
00:30:47,981 --> 00:30:50,461
当我只是个傻逼的时候
when all I am is a dumb motherfucker

541
00:30:50,503 --> 00:30:52,545
一直让人丧命的人！
who keeps getting people killed!

542
00:30:54,267 --> 00:30:56,427
该死的!
Damn it!

543
00:30:56,469 --> 00:30:59,150
你他妈的。你觉得这很好笑？
You fuck. You think this is funny?

544
00:30:59,192 --> 00:31:03,034
哈?你在上面的什么地方他妈的笑了？
Huh? You up there somewhere having a fucking laugh?

545
00:31:03,076 --> 00:31:05,516
哈?哈?
Huh? Huh?

546
00:31:05,558 --> 00:31:07,560
只是..。回答我！
Just... answer me!

547
00:31:08,001 --> 00:31:09,841
回答我！
Answer me!

548
00:31:09,883 --> 00:31:10,922
哈?
Huh?

549
00:31:10,964 --> 00:31:12,723
你说点什么吧!
Say something!

550
00:31:12,765 --> 00:31:14,767
你知道的..。
You know...

551
00:31:15,088 --> 00:31:17,891
篡改邮箱是联邦犯罪。
Tampering with a mailbox is a federal crime.

552
00:31:25,618 --> 00:31:27,620
(敲门)
(KNOCKING)

553
00:31:28,942 --> 00:31:30,944
进来。
Come in.

554
00:31:36,709 --> 00:31:38,950
她怎么样了？
How's she doing?

555
00:31:38,992 --> 00:31:40,994
她的情况越来越糟。
She's getting worse.

556
00:31:42,155 --> 00:31:44,237
她，嗯，她变冷了。
She's, um, she's getting cold.

557
00:31:55,208 --> 00:31:57,210
真的是这样吗？
Is this really it?

558
00:32:02,135 --> 00:32:04,137
事情就这样结束了吗？
Is this how it ends?

559
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,022
(叹息)我不知道。
(SIGHS) I don't know.

560
00:32:09,943 --> 00:32:13,744
你知道，自从她走下公交车
You know, ever since she walked off that bus

561
00:32:13,786 --> 00:32:16,988
我实际上允许我自己
I actually allowed myself

562
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:19,712
相信这一切都是有计划的。
to believe that there was a plan to all of this.

563
00:32:24,077 --> 00:32:27,800
我们在这里注定要做的事。
That there was something we were meant to do here.

564
00:32:28,841 --> 00:32:30,843
但没有...
But there's no...

565
00:32:32,765 --> 00:32:34,767
没有什么宏伟的设计。
There's no grand design.

566
00:32:36,169 --> 00:32:38,171
我们都会死在这里。
We're all gonna die here.

567
00:32:39,212 --> 00:32:41,254
而这一切都将是徒劳的。
And all this would have been for nothing.

568
00:32:45,218 --> 00:32:47,220
你知道吗，我爸爸曾经说过，
You know, my dad used to say,

569
00:32:48,101 --> 00:32:49,540
“我很难看到这件毛衣
"It's hard to see the sweater

570
00:32:49,582 --> 00:32:51,584
“当你只是一根线时。”
"when you're only just a thread."

571
00:32:53,666 --> 00:32:55,828
直到现在我才真正明白他的意思。
I didn't really know what he meant 'til now.

572
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:00,393
所有被困在这里的人。
All of the people that have gotten stuck here...

573
00:33:04,517 --> 00:33:07,040
也许我们不是可以回家的人，
Maybe we aren't the ones that get to go home,

574
00:33:08,681 --> 00:33:12,125
但也许我们在这里所做的
but maybe what we did here

575
00:33:14,127 --> 00:33:16,569
让下一个来的人更容易。
makes it easier for the people who come next.

576
00:33:18,331 --> 00:33:20,693
也许我们就是他们回家的原因。
Maybe we're the reason that they get to go home.

577
00:33:26,019 --> 00:33:27,618
仅仅因为我们只是一根线
Just because we're only a thread

578
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,662
并不意味着我们不重要。
doesn't mean we don't matter.

579
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:41,552
这就对了。
There ya go.

580
00:33:41,594 --> 00:33:43,794
你最不需要的就是哈特里缠着你
Last thing you need is Khatri haunting you

581
00:33:43,836 --> 00:33:45,838
凌驾于一切之上。
over everything else.

582
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,602
现在已经太晚了。
It's too late for that.

583
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:56,169
朱莉和玛丽埃尔。
Julie and Marielle.

584
00:33:56,609 --> 00:33:58,611
兰德尔。
Randall.

585
00:34:01,134 --> 00:34:03,136
莎拉说他们快死了。
Sara says they're dying.

586
00:34:04,057 --> 00:34:05,296
一旦他们走了，
And once they're gone,

587
00:34:05,338 --> 00:34:08,179
不能把精灵放回瓶子里。
there's no putting the genie back in the bottle.

588
00:34:08,221 --> 00:34:11,222
不管这是什么，它都在等着我们
Whatever this thing is, it just waits for us

589
00:34:11,264 --> 00:34:13,266
去睡觉然后..。
to go to sleep and then...

590
00:34:14,147 --> 00:34:16,267
就像保拉一样。
Like Paula.

591
00:34:16,309 --> 00:34:18,311
嗯。
Yeah.

592
00:34:20,153 --> 00:34:22,753
她说音乐盒在那里，
She said the music box is there,

593
00:34:22,795 --> 00:34:24,835
就在那片空地上。
right there in the clearing.

594
00:34:24,877 --> 00:34:26,879
只是它不在那里。
Only it's not there.

595
00:34:28,321 --> 00:34:30,761
就像看一本说明书
Like looking at an instruction manual

596
00:34:30,803 --> 00:34:32,243
缺了太多页。
with too many pages missing.

597
00:34:32,285 --> 00:34:34,647
我怎么会..。我怎么能..。
How am I... How am I supposed...

598
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:39,092
我昨晚见到了我的妻子。
I saw my wife last night.

599
00:34:41,094 --> 00:34:43,096
她看起来怎么样？
How'd she look?

600
00:34:46,339 --> 00:34:48,341
一定要有规则的，唐娜。
There's gotta be rules, Donna.

601
00:34:49,662 --> 00:34:54,305
一定有什么东西我可以拿在手里。
There's gotta be something I can hold in my hands.

602
00:34:54,347 --> 00:34:56,349
一定会有如此..。
There's got to be so...

603
00:34:59,072 --> 00:35:01,074
这是我干的。
I did this.

604
00:35:02,235 --> 00:35:04,477
我把这玩意儿带回来了。
I brought this thing back here.

605
00:35:05,158 --> 00:35:07,160
是的。你当然是这么做的。
Yup. You sure did.

606
00:35:09,122 --> 00:35:11,762
你也给了一大群人更多的时间
You also gave a whole bunch of people a lot more time

607
00:35:11,804 --> 00:35:13,806
如果不是你的话他们会得到更多。
than they would've had if wasn't for you.

608
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,490
你给了我更多时间。
You gave me more time.

609
00:35:19,332 --> 00:35:21,454
你儿子就要结婚了。
Your son is about to get married.

610
00:35:22,855 --> 00:35:24,054
我想，没什么正式的。
Nothing official, I guess.

611
00:35:24,096 --> 00:35:26,098
我们不再有牧师了。
It's not like we have a priest anymore.

612
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:31,184
他们充分利用了他们所拥有的任何时间。
They're making the most of whatever time they have.

613
00:35:33,146 --> 00:35:35,506
你也应该这么做。
You should do the same.

614
00:35:35,548 --> 00:35:37,950
跟我回殖民地之家吧。
Come back to Colony House with me.

615
00:35:42,235 --> 00:35:43,514
我不会放弃的。
I'm not giving up.

616
00:35:43,556 --> 00:35:46,397
(咯咯笑)我说放弃了吗？
(CHUCKLES) Did I say give up?

617
00:35:46,439 --> 00:35:48,599
(呻吟)
(GROANS)

618
00:35:48,641 --> 00:35:52,203
博伊德，这可能是我们最后几个小时了。
Boyd, this may be the last few hours any of us get.

619
00:35:52,245 --> 00:35:55,085
所以，你为什么不停止做一个该死的殉道者
So, why don't you just stop being a goddamn martyr

620
00:35:55,127 --> 00:35:57,770
来看看你儿子的婚礼吧。
and come and watch your son get married.

621
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:02,655
当仪式结束时，世界末日还会在这里。
The end of the world'll still be here when the ceremony's done.

622
00:36:05,218 --> 00:36:07,220
(呼气)

(倒吸一口气)
(GASPS)

628
00:36:45,218 --> 00:36:47,218
安库伊。安库伊。
Anghkooey. Anghkooey.

Anghkooey. Anghkooey.

631
00:36:50,943 --> 00:36:54,505
安库伊。安库伊。安库伊。安库伊。安库伊。
Anghkooey. Anghkooey. Anghkooey. Anghkooey. Anghkooey.

632
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:58,148
安库伊。安库伊。安库伊。安库伊。安库伊。安库伊。
Anghkooey. Anghkooey. Anghkooey. Anghkooey. Anghkooey. Anghkooey.

安库伊。安库伊。安库伊。安库伊。
Anghkooey. Anghkooey. Anghkooey. Anghkooey.

636
00:37:06,799 --> 00:37:10,921
安库伊！安库伊！安库伊！安库伊！安库伊！
Anghkooey! Anghkooey! Anghkooey! Anghkooey! Anghkooey!

637
00:37:10,963 --> 00:37:12,965

(蝉嗡嗡作响)
(CICADAS BUZZING)

639
00:37:42,715 --> 00:37:45,836
关于孩子们，你母亲还说了什么吗？
Did your mother say anything else about the children?

640
00:37:45,878 --> 00:37:47,880
她怎么能救他们呢？
How was she gonna save them?

641
00:37:48,841 --> 00:37:51,041
我不知道。她所说的就是
I don't know. All she said was that

642
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:53,085
他们需要她。
they needed her.

643
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:56,769
这是..。这应该是正确的..。就在这里。
It's... It should be right... right here.

644
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:00,971
不，不。这些……这些树不是..。
No, no, no, no. These... These trees weren't...

645
00:38:01,013 --> 00:38:03,254
嘿，嘿，嘿。那是很久以前的事了，维克多。
Hey, hey, hey. It was a long time ago, Victor.

646
00:38:03,296 --> 00:38:07,938
也许.。也许我们拐错弯了。
Maybe... Maybe we took the wrong turn.

(CICADAS BUZZING, GLASS CLINKING)

650
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,669
谁把瓶子放在那里的？
Who put the bottles there?

651
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:19,432
我不知道。
I don't know.

652
00:38:24,757 --> 00:38:26,919
这就是我发现她的地方。
This is where I found her.

653
00:38:28,401 --> 00:38:30,160
你妈妈？
Your mom?

654
00:38:30,202 --> 00:38:33,724
是的，在所有人都死后，我来找她。
Yeah, after everyone died, I came looking for her.

655
00:38:33,766 --> 00:38:35,768
她的身体..。
Her body was...

656
00:38:40,052 --> 00:38:42,294
她没能爬到树上。
She didn't make it into the tree.

657
00:38:45,938 --> 00:38:47,940
你说撞到树上是什么意思？
What do you mean into the tree?

658
00:38:48,621 --> 00:38:50,781
噢。
Oh.

659
00:38:50,823 --> 00:38:52,825
来。
Come.

660
00:38:56,989 --> 00:38:58,991
这是一棵很远的树。
It's a faraway tree.

661
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,760
怪物进入殖民地之家的那晚，
The night the monsters got into Colony House,

662
00:39:09,802 --> 00:39:14,004
朱莉说你们都是爬到树上逃出来的。
Julie said you both escaped by climbing into a tree.

663
00:39:14,046 --> 00:39:15,966
他们总是带你去不同的地方，
They always take you different places,

664
00:39:16,008 --> 00:39:18,969
你永远不知道你会在哪里结束，
and you never know where you'll end up,

665
00:39:19,011 --> 00:39:22,893
但我妈妈说这一次很特别。
but my mother said this one was special.

666
00:39:22,935 --> 00:39:24,775
它会把她带到塔上，
That it would take her to the tower,

667
00:39:24,817 --> 00:39:26,817
敬孩子们。
to the children.

668
00:39:26,859 --> 00:39:28,859
然后呢？
And then what?

669
00:39:28,901 --> 00:39:30,903
呃..。
Uh...

670
00:39:32,064 --> 00:39:34,066
我只记得这些。
That's all I remember.

671
00:39:39,031 --> 00:39:41,514
噢。嗯。这里。
Oh. Yeah. Here.

00:39:44,316 --> 00:39:46,318
我..。
I...

我在里面放了些零食给你。
I put some snacks inside for you.

嗯。
Yeah.

677
00:40:00,813 --> 00:40:02,733
穿过去疼吗？
Does it hurt to go through?

678
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,137
不，这就像走进一扇门。
No, it's just like walking through a door.

679
00:40:07,379 --> 00:40:09,019
好吧。嗯。
Okay. Mm.

680
00:40:09,061 --> 00:40:11,504
好吧。谢谢。
Okay. Thank you.

Oh, my God.

00:41:22,374 --> 00:41:24,254
我们这是在干嘛？
What are we doing?

688

他想让它成为一个惊喜。
He wanted it to be a surprise.

他想要的是什么惊喜？
He wanted what to be a surprise?

690
00:41:31,984 --> 00:41:34,424
你总是说这个景色甚至让这个地方
You're always saying that this view makes even this place

691
00:41:34,466 --> 00:41:37,870
看起来像个梦，所以我想。
look like a dream, so I figured.

692
00:41:39,471 --> 00:41:41,672
这样行吗？
Is this okay?

693
00:41:41,714 --> 00:41:43,716
这真是太完美了。
This is perfect.

694
00:41:51,323 --> 00:41:54,044
嘿，我们为什么不直接去找他呢？
Hey, why don't we just go get him?

695
00:41:54,086 --> 00:41:56,088
他有很多心事，你知道吗？
He's got a lot on his mind, you know?

你做到了。
You made it.

698
00:42:01,413 --> 00:42:03,453
什么，你在开玩笑吗？
What, are you kidding me?

好的，等等。嗯.。
Okay, wait. Um...

703
00:42:15,387 --> 00:42:17,147
我知道这不算什么过道，
I know it's not much of an aisle,

704
00:42:17,189 --> 00:42:20,833
但你愿意给我这个荣幸吗？

713
00:43:06,799 --> 00:43:08,801
我父亲有一句话。
My father had a saying.

714

(大家都在笑)
(ALL LAUGHING)

716
00:43:14,126 --> 00:43:17,449
嗯，我最喜欢的是……
Um, my favourite one was always...

717
00:43:19,732 --> 00:43:23,453
“生命是一次穿越未知的旅程，

“尽管你的眼睛和思想有时可能
"and though your eyes and mind may sometimes

719
00:43:27,059 --> 00:43:30,743
“欺骗你，你的心永远不会说谎。”
"deceive you, your heart will never lie."

720
00:43:33,305 --> 00:43:36,028
从我遇见你的那一刻起，我的心就一直属于你。
My heart's belonged to you since the moment I met you.

721
00:43:39,872 --> 00:43:42,432
你是我一生的挚爱，
You're the love of my life,

722
00:43:42,474 --> 00:43:44,476
只要生命能持续下去。
for as long as that life may last.

723
00:43:46,358 --> 00:43:49,521
所以，你愿意，埃利斯·史蒂文斯，
So, will you, Ellis Stevens,

724
00:43:50,843 --> 00:43:53,085
我有幸成为我的丈夫吗？

725
00:43:55,047 --> 00:43:57,049
这就做。

(笑)嗯.

733
00:44:27,439 --> 00:44:29,441
我和家人看到那棵树的那天，
The day my family and I saw that tree,

734
00:44:30,602 --> 00:44:32,604
我们的生活永远改变了。

735
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,051
但我看到你下车的那一天，
But the day that I saw you get out of that car,

736
00:44:40,652 --> 00:44:42,695
那是我生命真正开始的那一天。
that's the day that my life really began.

737
00:44:46,138 --> 00:44:50,743
在这里有太多次我觉得...
There have been so many times here where I felt...

738
00:44:52,664 --> 00:44:54,666
就像我在黑暗中跌跌撞撞。
like I was stumbling in the dark.

739

But each and every time,

740
00:45:00,993 --> 00:45:03,475
你是指引我走过的那道光。
you were the light that guided me through.

741
00:45:06,358 --> 00:45:08,360
你是我的爱。

你就是我的家。
You are my home.

743
00:45:13,605 --> 00:45:15,968
在黑暗的地方，你是我的光。

埃利斯：爸爸，你还好吗？
