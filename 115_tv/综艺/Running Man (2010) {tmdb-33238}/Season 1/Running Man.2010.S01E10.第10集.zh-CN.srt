1
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,430
Freeze,punk!

2
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,430
The next one of these goes in your worthless perp ass!

3
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,620
I'll tell you,

4
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,550
if there's anything I hate more than a thief...

5
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,590
it's running.

6
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,300
Spicy!

7
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,980
Spicy in my eyes!

8
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,740
Where are ya? I can't see!

9
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,790
I can't see! I can't see!

10
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,560
Dallas police department!

11
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,600
I am commando-ing this vehicle!

12
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,360
Please exit the vehicle!

13
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,370
Get out! Thank you.

14
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,370
All right.

15
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,040
What is... is this automatic or stick?

16
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,380
It's... it's an automatic! Are you okay to drive?

17
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,350
It's an automatic? Yeah. What are you...

18
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,410
Okay,so,just so I'm clear,

19
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,720
you commandeered a civilian vehicle,

20
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,170
then drove down the street completely blind...

21
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,460
in pursuit of a suspect.

22
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,450
And I caught him.

23
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:40,890
I caught him.

24
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,730
And he was caught. You're welcome.

25
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:43,800
I'm over here.

26
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,770
You're welcome.

27
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:45,840
Okay,so in your world,

28
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,910
I'm happy that you veered up onto a sidewalk,

29
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,250
destroyed a dozen parking meters,

30
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,600
and then collided with an ice cream truck?

31
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,840
Distracting the suspect...

32
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,040
so that he lost control of his moped thingy,

33
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,430
whereupon my partner arrested him.

34
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,080
Dan,you caused thousands of dollars worth of damage,

35
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,840
and,not to mention,endangered the lives...

36
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,480
of numerous innocent pedestrians.

37
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,900
Please! I was in complete control the entire time.

38
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,380
Okay then.

39
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,660
- You're suspended. - What?!

40
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,890
- Both of you. - What?!

41
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,390
On my desk,guns and badges. Now. Effective immediately.

42
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,130
Oh. Lieutenant,with all due respect,

43
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,360
why am I being suspended?

44
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,000
- I didn't do anything! - Exactly.

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,090
You had an opportunity to strangle him...

46
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,850
before he got in the car,and you didn't.

47
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,950
So,therefore,guns and badges on my desk,gentlemen.

48
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,240
This is bullcrap.

49
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,850
I don't need my eyes to bust a punk.

50
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,860
The only sense I need is my cop sense.

54
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,260
Well,all in all,I got to call that a win.

55
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:07,940
A "win"?

56
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,220
Dan,we got suspended for a week.

57
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,150
That is a loss.

58
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,710
That is a blowout loss.

59
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,120
Come on,you're acting like you've never been suspended before.

60
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,500
I have never been suspended before.

61
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,380
Well,look,every cop goes on "vacation" once in a while.

62
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,590
It's the department's way of saying...

63
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,640
you've been working too hard,

64
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,370
chill out,recharge your batteries.

65
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,450
Dan,this is not a vacation!

66
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:29,220
This is a serious black spot on our careers.

67
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,590
Sounds like you need a beer.

68
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,940
How about we pick up a six-pack...

69
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,700
and decompress in my thinking room?

70
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,330
Your "thinking room"? Yeah,no.

71
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,670
That sounds like getting drunk at the carousel.

72
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,700
No,thank you.

73
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,280
Well,we got to make a game plan for our vacation.

74
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,660
You know what?

75
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,860
We don't have to do anything.

76
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,740
'Cause if there is one bright spot in all of this,

77
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,220
it's that whatever idiotic,stupid,boneheaded thing you do tomorrow,

78
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,850
it won't be my problem.

79
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,500
That's no way to talk to your partner.

80
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,350
We're not partners,Dan.

81
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,920
Not this week.

82
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,910
I'm on vacation.

83
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,260
Hey,I... I'm not the enemy here!

84
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,930
We may be on vacation,but the bad guys aren't!

85
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,280
There is much work to do,comrade. Come.

86
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:21,230
We need to do this deal as soon as possible. Today.

87
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,250
We'll see about that.

88
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,270
First thing I need to know is who I'm dealing with.

89
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,950
We are known in certain circles as "the Georgians."

90
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,140
You don't sound like you're from Georgia.

91
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,620
I am from Democratic Republic of Georgia.

92
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,990
My associate,buck,is from Atlanta.

93
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,570
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

94
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,500
Georgia,Georgia.

95
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,260
Yes,is... Is very funny.

96
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,590
Everyone makes joke.

97
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,230
We hooked up doing smugglin' runs out of the Gulf.

98
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,240
There was this kingpin down in Mexico...

99
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,600
was asking for "the Georgian."

100
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,240
I-I thought he was talkin' about me,

101
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,830
and Nikolai thought he was talkin' 'bout him.

102
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,540
We both show up,make team.

103
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,860
Rest is history.

104
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,610
Anyway,we got raided by the feds last June,

105
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,360
and Nik's cousin Sasha got pinched,

106
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,980
and we've been a man down ever since.

107
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,990
Our contact,he said you are capable...

108
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,310
of breaking a man out of prison.

109
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,770
Is this true?

110
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,720
I can bust your buddy out.

111
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,460
I can bust anybody out.

112
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,940
For a price.

113
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,920
Then give us price.

114
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,380
That depends on who you want sprung,don't it?

115
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,430
Who is it we're talkin' about here?

116
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,470
We want our Sasha back.

117
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,910
Ooh,baby.

118
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,940
Says here this fella killed an FBI Agent with his bare hands?

119
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,990
Bit a fella's ear off?

120
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,390
What do y'all want with a psycho like this?

121
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,760
Sasha is not psycho.

122
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,510
He is hero.

123
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,800
He is like a ray of light in this dark world.

124
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,660
- Sasha,hurry!

125
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:09,730
- Go!

126
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,870
You are too good for this world,Sasha!

127
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:21,810
Every night I see his face looking back at me.

128
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,780
His big,noble hands...

129
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:30,240
crushing the life out of the FBI Agent.

130
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,810
Now the joy of smuggling is gone.

131
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,620
My heart is breaking.

132
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,780
If we don't spring Sasha soon,

133
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,950
we might as well just pack it in and head on back to Georgia.

134
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,960
Or possibly Georgia.

135
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,110
Yeah,I get your point.

136
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,750
Well,sir,you want a fella like your buddy out of the joint,

137
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,500
it's gonna cost you some real money.

138
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,500
You gotta be kidding me...

139
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,860
We ain't got this.

140
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,850
Then I guess you could have figured out the way you live with a broken heart.

141
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,210
Said I'd find you here.

142
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,990
Yeah,I guess I...

143
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,700
Needed to blow off a little steam.

144
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,160
- Nice ? - Thank you.

145
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,890
How are you?

146
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,570
My day's going pretty crappy.

147
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,140
So I was actually coming by to see if you wanted too...

148
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,320
Do some fun,later.

149
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,530
Get a drink or something.

150
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:25,000
I mean as friends. We can do that still,right? As friends?

151
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,680
Yeah,have fun? Yeah,yeah.

152
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,230
I'm tons of fun.

153
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,790
Well,ah,I'm two-thirds fun,one-third danger.

154
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,950
That right?

155
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,020
You okay?

156
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,930
Just more Kyle stuff. You know.

157
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,470
The point is that we had a fight,

158
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,390
and we are not speaking at the moment.

159
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,280
Do you mind?

160
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,980
No. Be my guest.

161
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,650
It looks like we could both use a little fun.

162
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,420
Julius grant! Dallas police department!

163
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,070
We got the place surrounded!

164
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,790
I am on vacation!

165
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,200
I got a cooler full of beers in the car.

166
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,610
Looking for a little quality snitch/detective time.

167
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:16,240
Dan. Son of a... Julius.

168
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,480
What the hell you think happened?

169
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,560
It looks like you got punched in the face really hard.

170
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,020
Oh,no,no,no.Man,you said I had two weeks.

171
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,960
That's right. So?

172
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,720
It's been 13 days.

173
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,920
I don't think that's right.

174
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,120
I borrowed the money on the 5th. Today's the 18th.

175
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,310
Wait,no,the 5th was a Monday.

176
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,220
No,I borrowed the money on a Tuesday,okay?

177
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,990
Today's Monday,which means that it's been 13 days.

178
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,220
You're a day early.

179
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,880
Well,consider this a courtesy reminder visit.

180
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,160
Okay. Just... you know,next time,

181
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,180
you just give me a call,okay?

182
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,210
50 grand. In cash.

183
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,200
If I don't see it by tomorrow...

184
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,390
Snip.

185
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,740
Ouch. He'd really do that?

186
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,710
Yeah,man. He's threatened to take my,uh,

187
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,960
my baby-making accessories,man.

188
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,150
Dude's name is kasson,man.

189
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,620
And he just... he puts the shark in loan shark.

190
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,050
- How did you end up borrowing 50 grand,anyway? - Inventory.

191
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,190
Look,these shelves... they don't fill themselves,man,okay?

192
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,860
Plus,I'm trying to go straight,you know,

193
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,610
streamline my business model.

194
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,500
Stop stealing all the stuff you sell?

195
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,620
Yes,okay? But you know what?

196
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,050
It turns out that the stealing kept my overhead down.

197
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:40,860
You know,I got an Uncle with one "testee,"...

198
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,990
and he's doing great.

199
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,480
You know,it's all systems go down below.

200
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,340
I'm just thinking that maybe you can talk this guy down...

201
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,270
to a huevo solo.

202
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,260
- You talking about one? - A single.

203
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,230
- No,no. - You don't need two!

204
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,640
- It's like kidneys. - No,it's not.

205
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,210
- I understand the emotional attachment. - It's a matched pair.

206
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,470
- They don't have to be. - But they are.

207
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,650
They got fake ones.

208
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,920
It's a matched pair,Dan. Okay?

209
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,850
Look,you want to help me,help me,man.

210
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,690
I need a little cop action on this,Dan.

211
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,660
See,the problem is,this vacation I'm on...

212
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,870
is the kind where you don't really carry a badge.

213
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,260
You got suspended?

214
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,100
It's more like a-a disciplinary sabbatical.

215
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,480
Are you serious?

216
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,900
I saved your life,Dan.

217
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,380
I saved your partner's life. I took a bullet for you.

218
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,440
And the one time I really need you,

219
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,750
you're suspended.

220
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,890
I may be able to help you get that 50 grand.

221
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,780
Where you gonna get 50 grand,Dan?

222
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,960
Hey,stark,that parking is for police officers only.

223
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,270
People think you're stupid.

224
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,840
I'm not about to let a loan shark...

225
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,460
run my only snitch out of town.

226
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,910
Put it back. What are you,crazy?

227
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:46,990
Did you steal this money?

228
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,920
No,I didn't steal it. I borrowed it.

229
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,890
You pay off the shark,I'll bust him.

230
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,700
I'll get it back before anybody knows it's gone.

231
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,440
Hey,not to criticize your technique,

232
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,640
but I-I just don't think this is how a cop should handle this.

233
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,950
Well,good thing this week I'm not a cop.

234
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,520
Okay. So just... you know... I don't know...

235
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,460
Tell me how does this work,again?

236
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,500
Just hand the dude the bag.

237
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,470
Okay,then what do you do?

238
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,860
I'll be in the back in case he figures out he's being set up...

239
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,970
and starts cutting people.

240
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,390
Whoa. "People"? I-I'm the only one in here,Dan.

241
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,480
Don't get worked up! It's gonna be fine.

242
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,820
Okay,wait,wait,wait. So,w-we do the deal.

243
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,090
You run in and you bust him,

244
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,790
he's gonna know that we were working together.

245
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,180
No,I'm not gonna bust him right away.

246
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,610
I'm gonna tail him for a while and bust him later.

247
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,190
He's never gonna connect me and you.

248
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,840
Okay,but wait a sec. I got another question for you.

249
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,270
How you gonna bust him? You're not exactly a cop right now.

250
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,010
Fine,I am going to retrieve the money,

251
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,210
and then I am going to detain him...

252
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,450
at an undisclosed location until I get my badge back.

253
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,900
That sounds like you're just gonna rob him and then kidnap him...

254
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,630
and then,like,keep him in a dungeon for like a week.

255
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,130
You know what? It's... it's very technical.

256
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,970
You'd never understand. There he is.

257
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,490
- He's coming. - Okay. All right.

258
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:52,700
You're good,man.

259
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,930
Kasson. Hey,how you doing,man?

260
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:00,900
It's good to see you.

261
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,540
So,do you have my money today?

262
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,120
Or does the shark...

263
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,500
Get to have a bite?

264
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,540
Okay,all right.

265
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,430
I got your money. No biting.

266
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,490
Here. It's all here in the bag o'money.

267
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,440
This is great!

268
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,280
You know,I was hoping I wouldn't have to...

269
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,500
Hey,okay. Right. ...Snip your grapes off.

270
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,810
Yeah,I was rooting for that,too.

271
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,210
I want to apologize for the mix-up yesterday.

272
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,690
I know you have a lot of places you can go for money,

273
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,840
and I appreciate you coming to me.

274
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,360
Honestly,you and me...

275
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,350
I was hoping that we could still be friends.

276
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,120
Like b. F.F.'S. Mm-hmm. Sure.

277
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,300
You know what? Could you put that away for me,please?

278
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,930
It's making me a tiny bit uncomfortable.

279
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,090
- This thing? - It is.

280
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,710
- Sure,sure. - It is.

281
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,900
It's really just for show...

282
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,150
You know,the knife,the crazy eyes.

283
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,950
To be honest with you,

284
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,780
I haven't had to use this since Thanksgiving.

285
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,310
I cut a guy who wouldn't pass the gravy.

286
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,240
I'm kidding.

287
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,040
Or am I? I...

288
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,340
I didn't... I didn't know.

289
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,400
- I was in it,right? - Yeah.

290
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,590
I'm just gonna count this and I'll get out of here.

291
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,020
It ain't enough,Nik.

292
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,740
Teague wants 50 grand to spring Sasha,

293
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,480
- and we ain't even close to that. - This is bad.

294
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,010
Is very bad.

295
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,520
I don't know if we're gonna be able to pull this off.

296
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,240
Don't think that way!

297
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,910
We do it for Sasha.

298
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,320
Think of the good times we had together.

299
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:26,630
Remember how Sasha always is wiping bloody hand on sleeve... after he kill a man?

300
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:30,650
And we have to say,"no! Is evidence! Don't do that!"...

301
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:33,110
And then we have to burn his clothes.

302
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,170
And you remember when Sasha beat that trucker to death,

303
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,770
put the guy's hat on his head?

304
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:38,900
Ah,yes!

305
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,170
And he dance around and say,"hey,look at me!

00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,800

aa***

337
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,200
come on that will be fun.

338
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,470
all right,just one dance***

339
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,830
Really persistent.

340
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:32,520
I'm sure it's just,uh,Dan...

341
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,340
wanting a drinking partner.

342
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,000
The off button's the red one right there.

343
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,020
It's ruiz.

344
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,860
Um...I-I don't know... I...

345
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,280
I-I'm sorry. I... let me just...

346
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,840
Uh,this is Bailey.

347
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,810
Is he with you?

348
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,680
Put stark on the phone. Now.

349
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,240
I have no idea where Dan is.

350
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,230
- What's going on? - Oh,nothing big.

351
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:00,590
Just $50,000 is missing from the narcotics division.

352
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,610
$50,000?

353
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:06,380
Uh,okay. Well,this may sound like a stupid question,

354
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,620
but are you sure it's Dan?

355
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,810
Well,whoever took the money left an I.O.U. Written on a bar napkin!

356
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,340
Yeah,that sounds like Dan.

357
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,260
Find your partner...

358
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,740
and see what kind of trouble he's gotten himself into.

359
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,550
Yeah,understood.

360
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,210
What was that about?

361
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,540
Dan's in trouble.

362
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,010
You've been apart for one day.

363
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,450
How much trouble could he possibly have gotten into?

364
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,060
Nothing went wrong.

365
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,970
The loan-shark guy stopped at a bar.

366
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,800
Gave him some time to drink a few rounds.

367
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,090
When he comes out,I'm gonna bust him.

368
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:39,900
Keep me out of this.

369
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,200
Okay,this dude has a screw loose and a big-ass knife.

370
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,550
The two do not mix well.

371
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,040
Will you relax?

372
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,860
I've been following this dude and the bag of money for hours.

373
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,670
I got the situation completely under control.

374
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,550
Here he is now.

375
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,670
Where's the bag?

376
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,420
Uh,I got to call you back.

377
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,050
Hey,hey,hey,hoss!

378
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,360
Slow down a sec. Uh...

379
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,690
Sorry,do I know you?

380
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,910
Dallas p.D. Keep your hands where I can see 'em.

381
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,410
I got to ask you a few questions.

382
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,000
- You're a cop?  - Yes,sir,I am.

383
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,750
- You got a badge? - Of course I got a badge.

384
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,280
Why wouldn't I have a badge?

385
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,900
Actually,I don't have a badge. I'm undercover.

386
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,040
As what,the '70s?

387
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,490
Wow. I love it. That's funny. I never heard that before.

388
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,570
Where's the bag?

389
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,750
I don't want this to get violent.

390
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,880
Where did it go?

391
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,270
Relax. I've been following this dude...

392
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:37,440
50 g's at 10% a week... That's just predatory lending.

393
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,120
Is okay.

394
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,480
Once we have Sasha back,he will get money.

395
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,150
I can't wait to see the smile on Sasha's face.

396
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,980
You know the one I'm talking about with the... Yeah,yeah.

397
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:54,220
Look,let's get real... The money is gone.

398
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,830
I am a loan shark.

399
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:59,450
I loaned it... Shark style.

400
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,730
That is all I can say.

401
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,180
Ho,ho,ho. One second. One second. No! Yep. Whoa!

402
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,370
I'm gonna have to take you in for resisting arrest.

403
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,360
The hell you are. Show me your... oh!

404
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,340
All right. Whoa! Oh. Oh,my lord!

405
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:16,450
Whoa,low-blood-sugar moment.

406
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,850
Yeah,you got to keep your potassium up... when you're drinking!

407
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,270
He just had about,oh,I don't know,

408
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,290
three margaritas too many, but don't y'all worry.

409
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,940
You guys look great.

410
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:32,200
Everything is completely under control.

411
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,340
Dan?

412
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,570
Dan,are you here?

413
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,150
Oh,my God! This place has been ransacked!

414
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,790
No,it... it's always like this.

415
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:56,050
Uh,Jack,when I was talking about having fun earlier,

416
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:58,230
this isn't exactly what I had in mind.

417
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,490
Doesn't smell like he's been here recently.

418
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:06,610
Oh,wow. Is this a shrine to himself?

419
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:10,970
Not really. He calls it a "tribute." To himself.

420
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:13,500
Look,Jack,Dan is nowhere to be found.

421
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,650
There's no beer in the fridge.

422
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,930
Well,is it possible he just ran out of beer?

423
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,740
Actually,no.

424
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,870
All right,he had to have taken it somewhere.

425
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:23,050
Maybe to his thinking place.

426
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,010
I'm not even gonna ask.

427
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,330
You know what,Jack?

428
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,340
I've had enough fun for one night.

429
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,180
I know this is your job and you got to do it,

430
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,940
but,um,makes it hard to have a good time,doesn't it?

431
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,490
Well,no.

432
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,620
Can you just take me home?

433
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,270
Dan! It... it's me,Julius,man.

434
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,010
I got the,uh,I got the burger.

435
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:47,990
Over here.

436
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,490
Yeah,I got the burgers that you was asking for,man.

437
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,210
Oh! What are you trying to do to me,man?

438
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,530
I thought the whole idea of this was you was gonna keep me out of it?

439
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:58,500
There have been some unanticipated developments.

440
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,970
The department's money is gone.

441
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,510
Your friend has loaned it to someone.

442
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,940
Turns out he also puts the "loan" in loan shark.

443
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,180
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

444
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,630
I know,I know,I know. Give me the burgers here.

445
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:12,040
Okay,we can do this the easy way or the hard way.

446
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,300
The easy way is you tell me exactly what I want to know...

447
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,830
and we open a couple of beers...

448
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:20,600
and then we enjoy a lasso burger.

449
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,550
Mmm. How's that smell?

450
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:26,760
The best hamburger... Think about it... In Texas.

451
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,380
That is door number one.

452
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,280
Door number two is the hard way,

453
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,030
which I would really rather not do...

454
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,280
because I have not yet loosened up or stretched.

455
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,830
So,my question to you is...

456
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,960
What's it gonna be?

457
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,420
I ain't talking.

458
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:44,920
I ain't a snitch. Hey!

459
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,240
Hey,now that's uncalled for. Shoe fits.

460
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,570
Oh,damn it. It's gonna be the hard way.

461
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,760
Oh,no. You know what,Dan?

462
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,300
Can I...Punch him?

463
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,180
You sucker-punched me yesterday.

464
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,380
Yeah,sure.

465
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,460
I mean,I'm not a lawyer,but,you know,seems fair to me.

466
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,780
Yeah. Okay.

467
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,000
That's for coming a day early!

468
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,690
Ahh! What was that for?

469
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,100
That's for interest.

470
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,060
Looky here.

471
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,190
Nice police work,my brother.

472
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:15,880
- Okay,don't call me that. - Why not?

473
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,670
- It... it's... you know,it's weird. - Yeah,I get it.

474
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,380
Hey! That is private property!

475
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,240
Yes,it is.

476
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,500
It looks to be a list of all the people you have lent money to,

477
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,680
and I would imagine that the person you lent my money to... is on this list.

478
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,810
So,what should we do?

479
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,540
I tell you what... I do hate to be rude,

480
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,320
but I just need to make... Make a couple phone calls.

481
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,130
Well,wait,wait,wait. Don't,don't. Hang on one second.

482
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,100
Tch,tch,tch,tch,tch,tch,tch! Hang on.

483
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:41,120
"Bad mike"? This is Detective Dan stark...

484
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,970
All right,all right!

485
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:46,560
I loaned the money to two guys called the Georgians.

486
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,960
Where do I find them?

487
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:50,750
There you are!

488
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,830
Why didn't you answer my calls?

489
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,570
Well,I seem to remember someone telling me...

490
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:57,580
that I was not their partner while we were on vacation.

491
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:01,040
You didn't steal $50,000 fromom the department,did you?

492
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,150
Of course I di't steal $50,000.

493
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,320
I borrowed $50,000 from the department.

494
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,610
Are you out of your mind?!

495
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,630
I did it for a very good reason...

496
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:14,580
To save our dear friend and snitch Julius grant's...

497
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,740
opportunity to bring a child into this world.

498
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,430
But if your concerns are financial...

499
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,190
And I understand that right now...

500
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:23,690
You can rest assured that I am on my way...

501
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:26,130
to pick up the money that I borrowed right now.

502
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,180
So thank you for coming 'cause now you can help.

503
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,250
I scouted the place. Good news.

504
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,520
I can't wait.

505
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,270
I peeked in the window around back.

506
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,080
The money is sitting right there on a table.

507
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:45,050
Okay,so what should we do,Dan?

508
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,450
'Cause not only do we not have a warrant,we don't have badges.

509
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,100
So,what's your plan?

510
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,540
You just gonna walk up,knock on the door,

511
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:53,790
and say,"dallas police. Freeze. Drop your weapons.

512
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:56,330
We're surrounding the building. Now give us the money back."

513
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,060
I was thinking more like I'd,uh,

514
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,960
pick the lock,grab the bag when they're not looking,

515
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,190
and hightail it out of there.

516
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,880
So stealing it. That's your brilliant plan.

517
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,750
Oh,come on,jacko.

518
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,830
It's not stealing if they don't see you take it.

519
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,890
It's the very definition of stealing.

520
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,180
Cover me.

521
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,760
Oh... Cover you with what,Dan?

522
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,490
'Cause I turned my gun in to ruiz...

523
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,410
when you got us both suspended.

524
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,440
Think positive thoughts.

525
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,080
Send good energy.

526
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,330
Yes,we have the money.

527
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:36,990
A business loan.

528
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,730
Do you take cash bills?

529
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:42,250
Very good. And the plan,how is it coming?

530
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:44,940
Is done,then?

531
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:46,920
Wonderful!

532
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:49,160
Where can we meet you?

533
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,790
Hang on. Let me write this down.

534
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:54,820
All right,Dan.

535
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:09,460
There's another pen right over there.

536
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,040
Okay. Yes.

537
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:18,840
3:00. I'll see you there.

538
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,310
No,no,no,no!

539
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:39,190
Dallas police! Drop your weapons! Freeze!

540
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:41,290
We're surrounding the building!

541
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,300
Not again!

542
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,010
Let's get the money and get out of here!

543
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:50,060
Next time,I'll cover you.

544
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:56,100
This peach is incredibly juicy.

545
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:58,430
- Do you want one? - No,I'm fine.

546
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:01,030
There's a lot of stuff here written about the same guy,

547
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,810
a Sasha tsalka.

548
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:06,370
I'm guessing he's not the brains of the operation.

549
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,490
Well,your friends came through with the cash.

550
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,390
It's gonna be delivered this afternoon,

551
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:16,310
which means you are getting out of here.

552
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,690
The only way to make a clean break...

553
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:20,470
is while transferring you to a high-security facility.

554
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,800
Of course,I'd need a justifiable reason...

555
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,540
for transferring you there.

556
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,810
Doing serious bodily harm to a guard... would be a good example.

557
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,270
You think you can help me out?

558
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,590
All right,then.

559
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,310
Johnson!

560
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:41,520
- Yes,sir? - Escort this prisoner back to his cell,please,sir.

561
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:54,070
Please help me!

562
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,920
Why am I not surprised?

563
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:08,350
I mean,yeah,sure. Why not? You know?

564
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,310
What's another black spot on our record?

565
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,820
That's exactly what I thought.

566
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,310
Okay,here's the situation...

567
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:16,550
Your friends with my 50 grand,they just tried to fill us with lead.

568
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,370
So now you're gonna tell us why.

569
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,300
Or we can drag you down to the station.

570
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,290
With your knife... and all the snip,snip,snipping you've been doing,

571
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:25,260
you could spend a long time in jail.

572
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,020
No,no,no. You got it all wrong.

573
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,520
I am really a nice guy.

574
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,600
You have to understand something...

575
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,130
In my business,the only leverage I have...

576
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:39,310
is the threat of cutting off a man's jewels.

577
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:42,460
Any actual lopping off would be a failure on my part.

578
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,810
I would not get my money back,I would lose a customer,

579
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,620
and probably a friend.

580
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,420
Okay. Um...

581
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,420
Well,why don't you tell us w-what you know,

582
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,400
and... And we can all be friends?

583
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,010
We could be pals.

584
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,710
Okay,there was one thing.

585
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,560
They wanted to some equipment,some military stuff.

586
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,550
Military stuff? What kind of military stuff?

587
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:11,320
Rocket grenade launchers,gas masks.

588
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,120
One of those things that the army uses to stop cars.

589
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,210
You know what? This has been a great start.

590
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:17,650
- I did good? - Yeah.

591
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:19,750
You're turning into a great snitch.

592
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:21,760
Dig in.

593
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,620
The money is all here.

594
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,510
Mm. Nice.

595
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,090
I need to walk you through this.

596
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:33,940
You're gonna need these.

597
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,750
This is the primary route we use...

598
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,180
for high-security prisoner transports.

599
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,460
Usually,we escort the van with an armed convoy.

600
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,590
I'll make sure we're riding light.

601
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,100
You hit the van here.

602
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,620
You're gonna get one shot at this,slick,

603
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,730
so make sure you arrive...

604
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,230
with enough firepower to make it count.

605
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,900
We have everything we need.

606
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,520
That's right. We're loaded for bear.

607
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,200
Okay,we got to stop this,whatever "this" is.

608
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,280
We've got to call it in.

609
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,770
I thought you said it wasn't a case.

610
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:03,350
I did. And it's not. It's just...

611
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,000
You're right. We're still cops.

612
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,830
Can you call Liz,see if she can work some of her lawyer mojo on it?

613
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,050
No,no. Now is not a good time to call Liz.

614
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:12,390
- Did you guys have a fight?  - No,we were having a terrific evening,

615
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,840
but then I found out that my partner stole $50,000...

616
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,770
from the police department.

617
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:19,070
Borrowed $50,000. I borrowed $50,000.

618
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:21,480
Yeah,okay. I got to call the lieutenant.

619
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,060
Tell me you have found your idiotic partner.

620
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,920
Uh,no.

621
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,850
Uh,not yet,but I...

622
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:34,610
But I'm close. Inches away,really.

623
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,740
Let me handle this.

624
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,350
- Detective? - Hi,uh,yes,hello.

625
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:42,450
Um,look,I-I've got a theory on where stark might be,

626
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:44,070
but just to be sure,

627
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,910
I need some department information,

628
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,880
you know,under the table.

629
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:49,690
Okay,what's going on,Jack?

630
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:50,540
Well,to be fair,

631
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,390
you probably shouldn't know about it,lieutenant.

632
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,600
Legally speaking.

633
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,280
But it's just one record.

634
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:56,860
Which one?

635
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:00,340
Sasha tsalka. T-s-a-l-k-a.

636
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,300
All right,but you should know...

637
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,950
that I have an a.P.B. Out on stark,okay?

638
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:05,110
The entire department is looking for him.

639
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:07,490
That... that's great. That will really help.

640
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,180
All right,here we go. Sasha tsalka.

641
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,380
Looks like he's at leland state pen.

642
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,280
Oh,this is interesting.

643
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,280
He's about to be transferred to a supermax.

644
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,030
Transferred to supermax? When?

645
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,950
About 20 minutes.

646
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,810
Uh,lieutenant,you might want to call the prison...

647
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:26,150
and tell them they're gonna need to beef up their security... for that prisoner transfer.

648
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,660
What is this about,Detective?

649
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,730
I'm sorry,I got to go,

650
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:30,740
but as soon as I can,I'll get you up to speed.

651
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:42,770
Okay,turn here. If they're going from leland state pen to the supermax,they got to take 11th.

652
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:44,300
You sure about that?

653
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:48,070
Why else would they buy all that equipment,all right?

654
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,850
Someone is busting this Sasha out of prison... unless we get there first.

655
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,450
That's what I'm talking about! You're using your cop sense!

656
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,890
It's what's inside that counts!

657
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,170
You know,I'd like to point out...

658
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:58,840
that you financed this prison break with department money!

659
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,520
Don't get bogged down in the details.

660
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,620
The important thing is,

661
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,080
we are on the streets,enforcing the law.

662
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,200
You just ran that red light!

663
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,290
What did I just say about not getting bogged down in the details?

664
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:17,070
I had that dream again last night.

665
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,650
The one where ruiz is giving me a bubble bath.

666
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,900
Was that who I thought that was?

667
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,580
I've been waiting for this my whole life.

668
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:42,560
This is Hodges and lang. We have eyes on the trans am.

669
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,120
Request permission to attempt a disabling maneuver,

670
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,670
and possibly the use of lethal force,if necessary.

671
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:50,200
Hey,Hodges,Dan stark here.

672
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,380
We're involved in a little police work,

673
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,750
so you might want to sit this one out.

674
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,700
Also,people still think you're dumb. Ooh.

675
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:00,110
Where the hell's the prison van? This is the road.

676
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,450
I mean,we're bound to cross him sometime.

677
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,920
Just keep your eye out.

678
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,690
Uh,hey.

679
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,220
Hey. Do you have one second?

680
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,410
Uh... Yeah,sure.

681
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,050
Listen,I wanted to apologize to you.

682
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:27,810
I went off on you the other day,and I shouldn't have done that.

683
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,130
Right,right.

684
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,300
Truth be told,Kyle and I just aren't connecting lately.

685
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,180
I don't know what it is,

686
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:36,250
but it feels like he just isn't even listening to me anymore.

687
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,550
Watch out!

688
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,410
I won't lie. That was close.

689
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:42,630
Jack? What's going on?

690
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:43,990
I'm sorry,what did you say?

691
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,750
Oh,my God,you've got to be kidding me.

692
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,790
No,I-I-I agree.

693
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:50,110
Or... or disagree. It's... it's just,uh...

694
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:52,260
- You know what,Jack? Never mind. - No,wait! Liz!

695
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,490
Oh. Lizzy got some burlap in her panties?

696
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:56,800
What do you say next time ruiz puts us on "vacation,"...

697
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,320
we just head down to Miami?

698
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,310
So you're saying there will be a next time.

699
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,740
Nice.

700
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,510
This is warden teague.

701
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,990
Warden,this is lieutenant ruiz from Dallas p.D.

702
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:12,480
We've been hearing some,well,let's just call it chatter...

703
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,370
about a prisoner you're moving today.

704
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,770
What do you mean,chatter?

705
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:16,800
Nothing definitive.

706
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,750
Just thought you might want to hold off on that transfer...

707
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,070
till we can provide you with some extra security.

708
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,410
I'd like to help you,lieutenant,

709
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,690
but that convoy has left already.

710
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:28,070
I-I tell you what. I'll see what I can muster up.

711
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,500
But I want to thank you for the heads up.

712
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,900
Anytime.

713
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,640
Pull it over,stark!

714
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,060
Lose them!

715
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:44,370
The hell did Hodges learn to drive like that?

716
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:52,110
Pull over,stark!

717
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,300
Pull it over,stark!

718
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,460
We've got you!

719
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,220
Yeah,just one second,Hodges.

720
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,410
Just give me the milk out of the back seat. The milk! Stat!

721
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,790
Give it to me,give it to me,give it to me,give it to me.

722
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,590
How old is that milk?

723
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,710
Whoo! Old.

724
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,580
Hey,lang!

725
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,200
Stark!

726
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:25,270
Okay,why do you have a gallon of old milk in the back seat?

727
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,740
That's an oldie but goodie that Frank came up with.

728
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,280
It's called "a milk shake."

729
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,740
- Was that? - Yes,yes!

730
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,770
I'm gonna have to ask you to hang on for this!

731
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,690
I can't wait to see the big lug.

732
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:40,450
Sasha!

733
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:44,090
You've lost weight,my friend. You look tiny.

734
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:48,820
Police! Freeze! Drop your weapon!

735
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:50,560
Now put your hands on your head...

736
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,960
and slowly back out of the vehicle.

737
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,630
Do not turn around or I will shoot you,all right?

738
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,590
A cop with knife?

739
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,090
Yeah. You're... you're just gonna have to trust me on that one.

740
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:06,800
In Georgia,we do not shoot an unarmed man.

741
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:08,380
However,in Georgia...

742
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:16,840
Who needs a gun? Am I right?

743
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:24,220
Uh,I wouldn't mind one right now.

744
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,750
Good thing there's two of us.

745
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,530
Yeah,but there's like three of him.

746
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:36,300
Got to fight him hand-to-hand!

747
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,440
- Like gladiators! - What are you talking about?

748
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:43,800
Dan... Dan,what are you doing?

749
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,260
Ha! No,no,no! Dan!

750
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,990
Okay.

751
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,930
What do you,uh,what do you say...

752
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:56,440
we just get back in the van and talk this out,yeah?

753
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:00,340
No? Okay. All right. Uh...

754
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,180
Dan! Little help here.

755
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,680
Yeah,yeah. I think we're wearing him down!

756
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:11,130
- Don't lose hope! - Okay.

757
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:13,160
- It's like "rocky iv." - What?

758
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,720
The ending... Not the beginning...

759
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,720
where the big Russian dude kills the black guy.

760
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,750
Oh,my lord!

761
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:23,330
Dan,we need a better plan here,buddy.

762
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:24,100
Yeah,we do!

763
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,320
Hey,uh,you don't need your eyes to catch a bad guy,right?

764
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,440
Huh?

765
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:37,040
No,I don't need my eyes!

766
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,400
All I need is my cop sense!

767
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,810
Oh! What?!

768
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,700
Hey,big guy!

769
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,500
Ooh! Geez.

770
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,610
My eyes. I love the smell of tear gas in the afternoon!

771
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:57,830
Come on!

772
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,890
This is spicy!

773
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:02,890
Come on! Jack,where is he?

774
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:04,700
You got to help me!

775
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,160
Am I close?

776
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,280
To your right!

777
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,460
My right!

778
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,320
- No,other right,I think. - Other right!

779
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,950
Come on! Ah!

780
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:30,430
I got him! I got him! Yeah,getting tired,baby!

781
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,020
Jack! Oh! He's double-husky!

782
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:41,850
I turned around. I clocked my boy,knocked him out.

783
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:43,110
He fell out.

784
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:45,390
So then the other dude came,but he punched me in my eye.

785
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,760
And another one kick... Oh,you know what? Right back.

786
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,160
These dudes... smugglers,all three of them.

787
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,440
The thin one... he Russian or something like that.

788
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,440
And this big dude... I know you supposed to be in jail,man.

789
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,150
You're Dan stark's c. I.,right?

790
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,930
Yeah,I'm Julius grant.

791
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:03,770
Care to tell me how they got here?

792
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,130
I single-handedly arrested them.

793
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:06,980
Yeah,it's like a... It's like a citizen's arrest.

794
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,110
Now,my question is,

795
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,880
is there like a reward for this kind of thing?

796
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:17,170
Okay,I'm gonna take that as a yes.

797
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:22,100
Mmm. Smells like home,doesn't it?

798
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,670
Indeed,it does.

799
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:26,580
And old milk.

800
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:30,290
Hey,Hodges. You still smell like a cow's ass.

801
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:33,090
If I were lieutenant,you two would never get your badges back.

802
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:34,330
Since you're not,

803
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:37,060
we lined up a new informant named kasson.

804
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,760
A former loan shark.

805
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,500
Surprisingly nice guy.

806
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,050
Would you do the paperwork on that?

807
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,440
Thank you,stinky.

808
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,860
Thanks,buddy.

809
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,720
Oh. Hello,Liz.

810
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:56,990
- This is weird. Did it get weird? - Yeah.

811
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:59,310
I know it's awkward,but I-I just...

812
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:01,680
I want to keep standing here. Can I?

813
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:07,890
- You're mad at me,aren't you? - Yes.

814
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,010
Because I was rude to you on the phone?

815
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:13,610
You do realize that I was in the middle of a high-speed chase?

816
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:14,700
It was very dangerous.

817
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,860
Oh,I forgot... you are two-thirds fun and one-third danger.

818
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,690
Exactly.

819
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:21,960
And you just happened to catch me during that one-third.

820
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,010
- Right. - So let me make this up to you.

821
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:28,900
You,me,some harmless paper targets,and some live ammo.

822
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,850
Jack Bailey,that is every girl's dream.

823
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,850
You sure your job won't interfere this time?

824
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,650
- Absolutely. - Bailey.

825
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:41,340
- Yeah? - I need you and stark in my office now.

826
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:44,130
Except this one time.

827
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,720
Dan?

828
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:49,150
Coming,dear.

829
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,570
Here we are again,gentlemen.

830
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:55,670
So what's it gonna be,Ana?

831
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,640
You gonna double-dog suspend us?

832
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,420
You should know that the money that went missing...

833
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:03,290
from the narcoticsepartment was marked.

834
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:04,590
Marked?

835
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,760
Yes,it was. And our system got tripped.

836
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,050
Turns out,someone deposited that money.

837
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,690
Cuff him.

838
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:18,680
What? Hey!

839
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,290
He paid off guards,clerks,inmates.

840
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:24,880
This marked money exposed a major prison scandal.

841
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:27,240
You're welcome.

842
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:32,230
Well,uh,what happens if... if word gets out...

843
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:35,780
about,uh,Dan's,uh,"borrowing"?

844
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:39,130
Um... If people find out that he stole the cash...

845
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,070
No,no. No,no one stole the cash.

846
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,780
One of our detectives simply signed out the money...

847
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,020
for a sting operation.

848
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:48,530
And,thankfully,there is paperwork on file.

849
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:51,170
It's terrible paperwork,but it's paperwork.

850
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:53,080
I never was really good with the forms.

851
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,060
Okay,so,lieutenant,what does this mean?

852
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,940
You are reinstated,effective immediately.

853
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:02,860
God help us all.

854
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,400
I love it!

855
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:07,710
- You sly dog,Ana. - No sly dog here.

856
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:09,810
I love this new side of you.

857
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:11,000
No,no,no. No new side.

858
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,440
- It's smoking hot. - No,no,no.

859
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,310
No hot... No smoking side.

860
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:15,750
You're a complicated woman.

861
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:16,960
Just get the hell out of my office,please,

862
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,020
and don't let me think about what I just did.

863
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:22,010
Dirty. I like it.

864
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,760
Nice bust.

865
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,240
Come on,partner. Vacation's over.
