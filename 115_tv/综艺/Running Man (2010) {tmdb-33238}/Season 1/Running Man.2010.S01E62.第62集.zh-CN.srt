短期旅行就像打开了疯狂的大门
To mini break is to prize open the crack of crazy,

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,000
你会有离开家的荒谬想法

某种运动病

26
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,810
字幕
so I place it in the Harribo family.

27
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,210
字幕
We are here, but should we have come?

28
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,900
字幕

29

字幕
reveals New York to be on the outer rim of short haul-erie.

30
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,040
字幕
We just had a long flight but I feel no jet lag.

31
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,480
字幕
I feel terrible.

32
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,970
字幕
I find it very difficult to cope with any form of travel, I’m weak.

33
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,330
字幕
Yet, you’re a travel man?

34
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:48,640
字幕
Its unfortunate casting, you’re probably wondering why the heck

35
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,450
字幕
I have brought you to these climbs.

36
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,080
字幕
Are you wondering that?

37
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,990
字幕
I wasn’t going to ask you that until after the bridge,

38
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,320
字幕
but, Richard why have you brought me to Manhattan?

39
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,460
字幕
Well, that question is timely.

49
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,040
字幕
the streets here are so good that they will both inspire you

50
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,790
字幕
and make you feel brand new alongside some other statements

51
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,700
字幕
that were basically just boasting.

字幕
Thank you, have a good day

61
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,840
字幕
You can see it at the baggage claim

62
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,320
字幕
You can see that from space,

63
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,820
字幕
I imagine there is going to be outfit changes

64
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,790
字幕
Many

65
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:02,620

70
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,160
字幕
You know like the ones you use at home.

71
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:19,760
字幕
Hello

72

字幕
with 1 point 763 billion journeys a year.

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,820
字幕
You’ve probably got a ranking system of your favourite

81
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,120
字幕
underground transport networks, how does this rank?

82
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,720
字幕
New York City subway ranks higher than Germany

83
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,400
字幕
Really

84
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,470
字幕
Definitely higher than Toronto

85
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,600
字幕
But, um not as good as London

86
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,570
字幕
Thank you

87
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,080
字幕
We’re rollicking uptown to midtown

88
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,840
字幕
to curve our corneas round the cities sites.

89
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,310
字幕
Well here we are,

90
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:13,650
字幕
about to enjoy Elm Green and  Dragset’s Van Gough’s ear,

91
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,680
字幕
This thankfully temporary art work guards the 5th avenue

end of the Rockefeller centre, home to radio city music hall,

字幕
It is exquisite

95
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,760
字幕
Ah, it’s a triumph to the art deco style

96

字幕
A trip to the top of 30 rock allows a bod a full oculus swoop of the city skyline.

00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,090
字幕
Richard

98
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,010
字幕
Wow, 

99
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,380
字幕
ok, well you know yes this is densely clustered

100
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,110
字幕
It is

101
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,000
字幕
Prince Charles would hate this

102
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,970
字幕
Let’s put this via a screen, so that we can really drink this in.

103
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,050
字幕
This is going to tell us what we are looking at

104
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,240
字幕
What are we looking at?

105
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,460
字幕
We are looking at the empire state building

106
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,610
字幕
That’s cool

107
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,020
字幕
You can go round, Chrysler building

108
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,030
字幕
Oh yeah, I like that one

109
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,700
字幕
-Do you like it? That’s a good one  -It’s one of my fave’s

110
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,550
字幕
Do you know you can buy air space

111
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,800
字幕
around your building preventing anyone else

112
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,760
字幕
from building there and obstructing your views.

113
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,190
字幕
I did not know that

114
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,680
字幕
Sensing myself out of my conversational depth,

115
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,270
字幕
I suggest we leave and do something else.

116
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,160
字幕
The hot dog is a New York obsession.

117
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,980
字幕
Last year 2 point 5 bill dollars of sausage was sunk in the city.

118
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,710
字幕
Papaya King are the dukes of the dog scene,

119
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,890
字幕
with 84 years on the clock.

120
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,560
字幕
It’s good, yeah.

121
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,050
字幕
I actually wrote my University thesis on the hot dog

122
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,350
字幕
and have many pertinent things to say about its cultural,

123
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,850
字幕
historical and socio-political impact.

124
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,810
字幕
But, just as I was about to speak Katherine railroaded me.

125
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,650
字幕
I think it’s important that we had a hot dog in New York.

126
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:55,800
字幕
It’s the type of food that you don’t feel super proud about eating

127
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,930
字幕
but it was kind of naughty and fun.

128
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,860
字幕
Let’s bust, you go.

129
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,270
字幕
Thank you so much Richard

130
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,010
字幕
Fine

131
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,040
字幕
Thank you

132
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,130
字幕
Having used uncharacteristic politeness

133
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,790
字幕
to hide my fury we hoff up to the largest

134
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:12,380
字幕
and most visited museum in all of America.

135
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,480
字幕
It’s the Met.

136
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:13,960
字幕
Wow

137
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,410
字幕
Within the context of Manhattan

138
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,670
字幕
it kind of looks boutique like a bungalow,

139
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,600
字幕
they haven’t used the air space wisely

140
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,030
字幕
at all considering the value of the Real Estate.

141
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,920
字幕
The problem we face, 2 million exhibits, our time is limited.

142
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,650
字幕
What are we going to do?

143
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,900
字幕
I’ll tell you what we are going to do, off camera

144
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,170
字幕
Wait for me

145
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,800
字幕
In an effort to condense this mammoth museum,

146
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,550
字幕
I’ve secured the services of an independent guide,

147
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,020
字幕
who insists he will make our visit,

148
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,650
字幕
subversive, interactive, fun and fast.

149
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,450
字幕
We are going to fly through this museum.

150
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,870
字幕
Ok, good we are going to blast it into our retina and move on.

151
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,400
字幕
I love it

152
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:46,910
字幕
Ok

153
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:47,530
字幕
Well if we are going to do this,

154
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,800
字幕
we have got to get this thing started, shall we.

155
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,490
字幕
Yes, let’s get it started

156
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,650
字幕
We have a little museum hack tradition that gets us going

157
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,710
字幕
because I know you want to move fast

158
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:53,630
字幕
Yes, I do

159
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,210
字幕
All hands in the centre please,

160
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,370
字幕
we go down on mu and up on seum

161
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,970
字幕
and then charge into the met

162
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:00,820
字幕
This is quite a hack

163
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,720
字幕
I’m nearly 40

164
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,440
字幕
You’re nearly 40

165
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:02,820
字幕
OK

166
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,060
字幕
OK, well you’re going to have to keep up

167
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,500
字幕
Squash it down, move on

168
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,750
字幕
 Museum

169
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,890
字幕
Alright, let’s go

170
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,490
字幕
That must endear you to people

171
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:15,690
字幕
And so begins our slide across the surface of the Met’s 17 acres of galleries.

172
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,620
字幕
Arms and armour

173
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,570
字幕
I like that they give a little protection to the horses as well.

174
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,210
字幕
This is Henry the eighth

175
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,230
字幕
And this is?

176
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,010
字幕
Before

177
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:25,750
字幕
Ok

178
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,590
字幕
And after

179
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,700
字幕
So as he aged he became less concerned about his groin

180
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,760
字幕
Like many men, let’s move on

181
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,640
字幕
Welcome to Washington crossing the Delaware

182
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,820
字幕
Woah

183
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,290
字幕
And is this for Sale? It’s not for sale

184
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,980
字幕
Next pre historic and early Greek art.

185
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,820
字幕
What have we got?

186
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,690
字幕
We got this, alright

187
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:46,090
字幕
Ok

188
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,560
字幕
Check this out they think this may be a 6000 year old selfie

189
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,850
字幕
Commentators claim that the proportions of the sculpture

190
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:56,420
字幕
mean the artist may have been looking at herself without a mirror.

191
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,210
字幕
Ooh yes you are looking at this from the wrong angle Gentlemen.

192
00:07:59,210 --> 00:07:59,550
字幕
I know

193
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,920
字幕
And I like that she has natural breasts

194
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,460
字幕
Yes

195
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,600
字幕
Is this for sale?

196
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,510
字幕
No, unfortunately not

197
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,640
字幕
Ok, let’s move on

198
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,090
字幕
Welcome to the temple of Dendur

199
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,020
字幕
Thank you this is, I mean it’s extraordinary

200
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,050
字幕
The positioning of this gift from Egypt

201
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,070
字幕
was decided by former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.

202
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:21,780
字幕
Jackie O had purchased a brand new penthouse apartment

203
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,810
字幕
right across the street from the museum,

204
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,600
字幕
this is lit up 24/7 365 and suddenly the tabloids start

205
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,600
字幕
referring to this as Jackie’s night light.

206
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,910
字幕
It’s excellent

207
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,540
字幕
-It’s beautiful isn’t it?  -It’s really good

208
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,820
字幕
You don’t have to travel to Egypt,

209
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,960
字幕
that’s what I like about museums

210
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,010
字幕
Oh yeah, you can go all over the world in one afternoon

211
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,230
字幕
Oh, great

212
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,020
字幕
Our frantic twirl takes us to the roof

213
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,240
字幕
 where on we behold one of the museums newest exhibits

214
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,140
字幕
This is by Cornelia Parker, called psychobarn

215
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:48,580
字幕
Yeah

216
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:48,940
字幕
Yep

217
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,400
字幕
Right, thank you for having us, it’s an excellent museum

218
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,160
字幕
Oh well that’s wonderful to hear

219
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,810
字幕
I think now that I have added my approbations,

220
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,730
字幕
watch those till receipts sore, my influence is huge

221
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,830
字幕
I didn’t even know what a museum was until I met Richard

222
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:04,660
字幕
Exactly

223
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,420
字幕
I bow to you my friend

224
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,250
字幕
You mustn’t

225
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:07,710
字幕
Alright

226
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,440
字幕
You’ll start a trend, thank you

227
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,460
字幕
Bye guys

228
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:11,770
字幕
You’ve just gone now, you’re out of my life

229
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,580
字幕
I’m just out, we are never talking again

230
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,230
字幕
That’s so weird isn’t it

231
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,760
字幕
As evening encroaches in this series of moving images

232
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,870
字幕
we wend our way back to Chelsea

233
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,960
字幕
where we towel down and prepare for times to come.

234
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:29,200
字幕
Hi, this is good, Chris De Burgh would love it, let’s go

235
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,090
字幕
Hi

236
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,990
字幕
We are taking a sunset stroll along the high line

237
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,930
字幕
from which our hotel snatched it’s Monika

238
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:36,630
字幕
Straight down

239
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,410
字幕
OK

240
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:41,050
字幕
It’s a former elevated railway, now linear park.

241
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,770
字幕
Greenfingered viewers will know this

242
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:47,460
字幕
as the work of the uber influential garden designer, Piet Oudolf,

243
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:51,620
字幕
whose prairie plantings looks particularly plaintive in the setting sun.

244
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,200
字幕
Thoughts on this

245
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,650
字幕
Its glorious

246
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,110
字幕
Let’s move on

247
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:02,160
字幕
In a most second of parts we will shower in zucheros

248
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,330
字幕
Wow that’s so sugary it’s almost spicy

249
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,010
字幕
Embark on a pro-long skid

250
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:11,910
字幕
This is a kind of very slow moving zombie apocalypse

251
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,900
字幕
And start sweating in a jumped up garage

252
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,600
字幕
This is hell in here, why am I here?

253
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:26,790
字幕
We are more than half way through a two day dalliant in NYC,

254
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,440
字幕
part one featured the following sub headings,

255
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,080
字幕
taxi, hotel, Rockefeller, hot dog, museum, high line sing along.

256
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,010
字幕
You’re going to have to keep up

257
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:35,940
字幕
Ok

258
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,630
字幕
Day two begins with a frankly fascist 7. 30 am start.

259
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,340
字幕
Are we going for breakfast?

260
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,070
字幕
-Yes, we are going for a cronut  -A cronut

261
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:50,300
字幕
In May 2013, after 6 months toil chef Dominique Ansel launched,

262
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:54,450
字幕
a paradigm shifting piece of patisserie he called it the cronut.

263
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,000
字幕
A croissant dough is fried, then coated in sugar,

264
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,630
字幕
injected with cream and glazed.

265
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,420
字幕
Such is the demand for this confection

266
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,050
字幕
that queues form at 7am in the morning.

267
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,760
字幕
What time do they open, 8?

268
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:07,980
字幕
Yep

269
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,500
字幕
And then it all kicks off

270
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,900
字幕
I’m so tired and a strict two cronuts per person limit is in forced.

271
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,390
字幕
We’ll get 4 cronuts

272
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:15,930
字幕
Four

273
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:18,620
字幕
We’ll get our maximum allotted amount of cronuts

274
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,410
字幕
Sure, no problem

275
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:24,730
字幕
One food writer claimed a cronut contains 1300 calories;

276
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:27,010
字幕
over half a man’s recommended daily allowance.

277
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:31,520
字幕
The bakery says this incorrect and open quote absurd, closed quote.

278
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,590
字幕
Controversy like this is part of what makes a pastry seem so freaking exciting.

279
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,990
字幕
I’m getting leakage

280
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:37,680
字幕
Yeah me too

281
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,110
字幕
There is stuff inside here I did not expect

282
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,350
字幕
Wow, I think I have just developed diabetes

283
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,070
字幕
I think there is more sugar than bread

284
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:52,250
字幕
so I’ve placed it in the, in the Harribo family.

285
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,540
字幕
Right

286
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,280
字幕
I really like all the wetness of it, all the cream and sauce

287
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,090
字幕
I can eat this, then I could lie down

288
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,030
字幕
Let my blood adjust, 

289
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,640
字幕
while these tiny diabetic birds flap around me

290
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,910
字幕
and find bits of sugar from the corner of my mouth

291
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:11,840
字幕
This is great

292
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,530
字幕
This is the most sugar you have ever had in your life

293
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:15,330
字幕
I know, yeah

294
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,510
字幕
You’ve lost control of your entire waist,

295
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,960
字幕
wow mines so sugary it’s almost spicy.

296
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,640
字幕
I don’t even know what happened there.

297
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,070
字幕
That was really intense,

298
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,070
字幕
it’s a very emotional experience eating this as well,

299
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:32,170
字幕
you’re up you’re down, I don't know if I hate myself now,

300
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:35,110
字幕
or whether I’m pleased, I kind of won something,

301
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,810
字幕
I’m in an elite club,

302
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,860
字幕
but essentially I’m just scarfing sugar, 

303
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,520
字幕
what’s happening?

304
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,230
字幕
You need a second cronut to get you out of the first cronut hole

305
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,260
字幕
I’m slightly upset

306
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,550
字幕
Bang that’s a napkin drop

307
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,050
字幕
You’ve eaten all the cronut

308
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:57,340
字幕
Yes, how do you feel, I’ve got a headache, how do you feel?

309
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,670
字幕
I feel absolutely euphoric

310
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,600
字幕
I’m going to put this back up

311
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,820
字幕
Ok

312
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:06,680
字幕
My hands are shaking, ok let’s go

313
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,690
字幕
, let’s walk this, I need a second, I’m dipping, I’m dipping.

314
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:16,010
字幕
Before we are engulfed by insulin we flounce off to the ferry terminal

315
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,330
字幕
and board the Manhattan mainstay.

316
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,730
字幕
It makes me feel like live stock

317
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:21,950
字幕
In a good way

318
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,700
字幕
There’s not in a good way

319
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:28,530
字幕
The Staten Island ferry runs 24 hours a day 7 days a week.

320
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:32,400
字幕
And it’s 100% gratis offering travellers a time and cost effective

321
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,820
字幕
if some-what distant look of an NYC landmark.

322
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,640
字幕
And there she is

323
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,890
字幕
It’s an it, it’s not a person, it’s a statue, it’s an it,

324
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,350
字幕
I’m never sure about that hat,

325
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:47,490
字幕
it seems quite un-welcoming, quite pointing.

326
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:51,780
字幕
I see it as a friendly nod to nearby birds who might want to have a rest

327
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,620
字幕
Right

328
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,680
字幕
Do you feel like you have seen the statue of liberty now Richard?

329
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,560
字幕
I actually have seen it, so it’s more than a feeling, it’s a reality

330
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,560
字幕
With the temperature firing into the one hundreds

331
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,920
字幕
we courier into central park.

332
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:13,220
字幕
Visitors can explore this uptown rectangle by carriage, bike or leg.

333
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,350
字幕
After a brief off camera consultation with our separate stylists

334
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,850
字幕
we decide to get into our sports shizz

335
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:27,740
字幕
What could be better than learning to rollerblade in this heat?

336
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:31,690
字幕
Roller Joel’s created the first ever inline skating school 

337
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:34,360
字幕
in New York City in 1988.

338
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,930
字幕
Former clients include Cindy Crawford who used to work as a model.

339
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:38,560
字幕
Hey Guys

340
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,260
字幕
Hi, are you roller Joel?

341
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,250
字幕
I am indeed roller Joel and you are?

342
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:42,640
字幕
Richard

343
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,960
字幕
Richard, a pleasure to meet you

344
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,370
字幕
Katherine

345
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,530
字幕
Katherine, so welcome to New York,

346
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,870
字幕
welcome to Central Park, so have you skated before?

347
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:48,750
字幕
No

348
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,840
字幕
Have you skated before?

349
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,550
字幕
I have a little bit as a child

350
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,650
字幕
I will make you expert skaters when I’m done with you

351
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:54,270
字幕
Ok, really?

352
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,650
字幕
Natural pessimist Joel gets us padded up

353
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:59,380
字幕
This is going to be a good sequence when it’s cut together.

354
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,100
字幕
Before we bring the thunder

355
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:05,000
字幕
You know this could be the official Travel Man super hero uniform

356
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,400
字幕
I think you over estimate how much merchandise we push out

357
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:15,070
字幕
I’m just going to pull you, you’re a natural, look at you.

358
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,000
字幕
I feel like a retired dalek

359
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,110
字幕
Now put your hands forward on your knees and roll

360
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,240
字幕
This is a deleted scene from night of the living dead

361
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,320
字幕
Katherine choose herself to be a classic ringer

362
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,420
字幕
That’s it

363
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,770
字幕
Where as I develop instant osteoporosis

364
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,020
字幕
Now when you come back next time,

365
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,110
字幕
Sure, I’ll come on foot

366
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,860
字幕
we are going to cover a much extensive tour

367
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,880
字幕
We can cover all the acres on skates

368
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,680
字幕
But we do manage a credible creep round the park,

369
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,710
字幕
taking in the Bandshell used as a location in the film Breakfast at Tiffany’s

370
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:50,590
字幕
Hands forward, no, no, no, no

371
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,430
字幕
and the Bethesda terrace,

372
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,980
字幕
which you will recognise from Stuart Little 2

373
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,920
字幕
Wow, this is not my natural habitat

374
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,400
字幕
We finish at the Cherry Hill fountain

375
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,880
字幕
which many mistakenly think is the fountain at the start of Friends

376
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:10,780
字幕
Well thank goodness that was now something, I appreciate it

377
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,180
字幕
Well something is better than nothing

378
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:12,560
字幕
Good luck

379
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,180
字幕
I hope you had a good time, now don’t forget keep on rolling

380
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,490
字幕
Keep on joeling

381
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,710
字幕
Oh, I like that even better

382
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,480
字幕
That’s good

383
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,240
字幕
Knowing that mo can never be out-bond we swiftly Segway

384
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,740
字幕
from one sequence to another to create the illusion of momentum.

385
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,020
字幕
Look at this

386
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,260
字幕
It is quite grand

387
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,260
字幕
It is

388
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,040
字幕
Grand central terminus

389
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,150
字幕
Terminus?

390
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:35,960
字幕
Not station

391
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,800
字幕
Why not?

392
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,290
字幕
No trains pass through here,

393
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,410
字幕
it’s the end of the line and the beginning of the line,

394
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,780
字幕
750 thousand people pass through here daily.

395
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:47,190
字幕
It used so much granite that there is still radiation here,

396
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:49,050
字幕
we are in the middle of a radiation zone,

397
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,400
字幕
And they just decided that’s fine

398
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,450
字幕
There is nothing they can do about it,

399
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,940
字幕
there is that much granite, let’s hit the dining concourse

400
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,650
字幕
Yes

401
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:58,720
字幕
This corner of the station is home an acoustic anomaly

402
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:01,600
字幕
Hello

403
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,340
字幕
Hi Richard, how are you?

404
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,600
字幕
I feel slightly unnerved by this

405
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,680
字幕
Sound is reflected by the curve of the ceiling

406
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,800
字幕
so we can hear each other clearly despite standing ten metres

407
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,950
字幕
apart facing opposite directions.

408
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:18,360
字幕
This is a much easier for me to communicate that normal

409
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,480
字幕
It’s a lot easier

410
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,040
字幕
There is none of that strange eye contact business

411
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,500
字幕
or you know engaging with some ones face.

412
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,300
字幕
You know it just looks like you’re having a wee

413
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,700
字幕
It does, I’m going to step away now

414
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,550
字幕
Ok

415
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,760
字幕
My urine still warming the wall we canter to China town

416
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,990
字幕
for one last carafe for culture.

417
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:44,630
字幕
A museum that stands in rude opposition to the Met’s epic sweep.

418
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:46,410
字幕
Hello

419
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,590
字幕
Hello welcome to the museum

420
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:50,640
字幕
That curb is dangerous by the way, I almost killed myself.

421
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,690
字幕
So, the double m is silent.

422
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:53,220
字幕
Yes

423
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,790
字幕
The first M but the second M you sound

424
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,800
字幕
If you want to

425
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,960
字幕
Say it again slowly

426
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,830
字幕
Mmuseumm

427
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,470
字幕
Ok

428
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,470
字幕
Mmuseumm

429
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,480
字幕
Ok, Mmuseumm, thank you

430
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:07,520
字幕
Opened in 2012 the Mmuseumm is housed in a goods elevator,

431
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,430
字幕
which this afternoon has reached the temperature of fresh lava.

432
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,320
字幕
My glasses are slipping off my nose.

433
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,940
字幕
When they say the museum challenges you to find meaning

434
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,340
字幕
and objects from around the world which will be overlooked,

435
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,480
字幕
dismissed or ignored and they actually say this in this condescending sign

436
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,060
字幕
they’re not joking about it being a challenge.

437
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:28,030
字幕
Exhibits include different kinds of cornflakes,

438
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:31,390
字幕
and things left by illegal immigrants crossing in to America.

439
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:35,800
字幕
These are good these Trump accessories, energy drink

440
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,160
字幕
He has an energy drink

441
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,470
字幕
I actually own the Art of the Comeback myself but in paperback

442
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,540
字幕
How is it?

443
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,000
字幕
It’s heavy going

444
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,850
