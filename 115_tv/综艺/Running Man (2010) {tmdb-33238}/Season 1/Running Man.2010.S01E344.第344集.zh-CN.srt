1
00:00:02,428 --> 00:00:05,431
(Spring is here.)

2
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:06,732
(Hangang Park is filled with the scent of flowers.)

3
00:00:06,732 --> 00:00:09,201
- Hello. - Hello.

4
00:00:09,201 --> 00:00:10,503
- Hello. - It's a carpet.

5
00:00:10,503 --> 00:00:12,204
(The 6 members are as bright as the weather.)

6
00:00:12,204 --> 00:00:15,207
- Hello. - What is this?

7
00:00:15,207 --> 00:00:18,577
- Each stool has a name on it. - Okay.

8
00:00:18,577 --> 00:00:20,646
- Please sit on your stool. - Okay.

9
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:24,283
- They do have names on them. - It looks luxurious.

10
00:00:24,717 --> 00:00:27,520
(The members are welcomed by five kinds of bite-size food.)

11
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,189
I've been feeling hungry.

12
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:33,225
- It's eel and small octopus. - It's eel.

13
00:00:33,225 --> 00:00:36,228
- I love small octopus. - It's braised spicy chicken.

14
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:38,898
- Which one? - The second one.

15
00:00:38,898 --> 00:00:41,033
- Is this chicken? - I love braised spicy chicken.

16
00:00:41,033 --> 00:00:44,103
Last week, we asked you to recommend...

17
00:00:44,103 --> 00:00:48,107
your favorite restaurants that would perk up your appetite.

18
00:00:48,407 --> 00:00:51,744
What each of you is seeing on your table is...

19
00:00:51,744 --> 00:00:54,780
food from the restaurants recommended by the other members.

20
00:00:55,214 --> 00:00:57,550
Try them all...

21
00:00:57,783 --> 00:01:00,119
and pick your three favorites.

22
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:02,221
- Three? - After trying them all?

23
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:04,857
It's a blind test. Put aside your favorites quietly.

24
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:07,726
- Are we supposed to remain quiet? - Is it a blind test?

25
00:01:07,893 --> 00:01:10,129
- Try them all and pick three? - Right now?

26
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:12,798
One is spicy, and the other is salty.

27
00:01:12,798 --> 00:01:15,034
- It tastes good. - I'm done.

28
00:01:15,134 --> 00:01:18,304
- Pick three? - It has potatoes too.

29
00:01:18,304 --> 00:01:20,739
- It's very spicy. - I've picked three.

30
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:23,309
I have to choose this one.

31
00:01:23,309 --> 00:01:25,945
- I've picked three. - This one has to be included.

32
00:01:25,945 --> 00:01:28,914
- I'm done. - I'm done.

33
00:01:28,914 --> 00:01:29,915
(The blind test is over.)

34
00:01:29,915 --> 00:01:31,150
It tasted very good.

35
00:01:31,584 --> 00:01:34,386
Is the food really from the restaurants?

36
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:37,122
- Yes. - From the restaurants?

37
00:01:37,223 --> 00:01:39,692
I'm sure mine will be popular.

38
00:01:39,692 --> 00:01:43,395
- 4 restaurants have been chosen. - 4?

39
00:01:43,495 --> 00:01:45,331
Two restaurants share the first place.

40
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:47,833
(Which restaurants won the most votes?)

41
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:50,502
They're Seok Jin and Haha's picks.

42
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:52,771
- See? - Which ones are they?

43
00:01:52,972 --> 00:01:56,475
(Seok Jin's place offers Korean soul food, braised spicy chicken.)

44
00:01:58,277 --> 00:02:03,515
(Haha's place offers spicy and sweet stir-fried small octopus.)

45
00:02:03,515 --> 00:02:06,619
- I knew it. - I loved the sauce.

46
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:10,422
And Jong Kook and Kwang Soo share the second place.

47
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,457
Yes!

48
00:02:12,191 --> 00:02:15,127
(Jong Kook's place offers health food, roasted eel.)

49
00:02:17,162 --> 00:02:20,799
(Kwang Soo's place offers bulgogi stew.)

50
00:02:22,034 --> 00:02:25,704
- We'll visit these four. - Okay.

51
00:02:25,704 --> 00:02:29,141
Today's race is called Running Man's Food Guide.

52
00:02:29,141 --> 00:02:31,143
- What? - "Running Man's Food Guide"?

53
00:02:31,143 --> 00:02:32,778
- It sounds nice. - "Running Man's Food Guide"?

54
00:02:33,045 --> 00:02:35,881
It'd be so nice to have good food in the spring.

55
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:38,717
Running Man's Food Guide starts now.

56
00:02:38,717 --> 00:02:41,987
The food you'll get to try has...

57
00:02:42,054 --> 00:02:44,523
some secrets in it.

58
00:02:44,523 --> 00:02:45,891
(The food has secrets in it.)

59
00:02:45,891 --> 00:02:48,327
- What secrets? - Secrets?

60
00:02:50,562 --> 00:02:54,933
The team who finds out the secrets first will win.

61
00:02:55,701 --> 00:02:57,736
(What's the delicious secret?)

62
00:02:57,936 --> 00:03:01,507
Today, two guests who specialize in food shows...

63
00:03:01,507 --> 00:03:03,842
will join the game.

64
00:03:03,842 --> 00:03:06,045
- Do we have guests? - Where are they?

65
00:03:06,045 --> 00:03:08,480
- Guests, please come in. - Who are they?

66
00:03:08,914 --> 00:03:11,917
(The guests will join the members on the gourmet tour.)

67
00:03:11,917 --> 00:03:15,854
- Bo Mi. - Min Yong.

68
00:03:15,854 --> 00:03:19,224
- What's with your sunglasses? - It's been so long.

69
00:03:19,224 --> 00:03:22,027
- Hello. - What are you doing here?

70
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:24,296
(Let us introduce today's guests to you.)

71
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,932
(They appear on shows just to eat.)

72
00:03:26,932 --> 00:03:29,034
(They've been waiting for this moment.)

73
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:30,936
(They're perfect guests for the gourmet tour.)

74
00:03:30,936 --> 00:03:33,005
(Food shows are their specialty.)

75
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:35,674
- Hello. - Hello.

76
00:03:36,108 --> 00:03:38,677
SBS, Seoul Broadcasting System...

77
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:41,647
(Seoul Broadcasting System?)

78
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,185
As I'm on Running Man today, I'm wearing running shoes.

79
00:03:46,618 --> 00:03:49,388
I thought I'd be running around. I'm wearing a comfortable outfit.

80
00:03:49,388 --> 00:03:50,956
Haha rediscovered you, right?

81
00:03:50,956 --> 00:03:55,928
I don't know what he did, but that's not true.

82
00:03:56,395 --> 00:03:58,764
I'd like to put this straight.

83
00:03:58,764 --> 00:04:02,501
Haha didn't rediscover me. I was just worried about him,

84
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:05,404
so I made a comeback after a 10-year break.

85
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,407
(15 years ago)

86
00:04:08,407 --> 00:04:10,709
(Haha and Min Yong appeared in a comedy together.)

87
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,879
- Haha, you've got mail. - Mail?

88
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:19,752
(Min Yong made Haha a star.)

89
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:23,522
Haha could become a star...

90
00:04:23,522 --> 00:04:25,524
- thanks to Min Yong. - What are you talking about?

91
00:04:25,524 --> 00:04:27,926
- He's like your mother. - I passed the audition.

92
00:04:27,926 --> 00:04:29,928
Min Yong gave birth to Haha,

93
00:04:29,928 --> 00:04:32,131
and I raised him.

94
00:04:32,131 --> 00:04:34,633
I created him.

95
00:04:34,633 --> 00:04:36,902
- What about my parents? - Jae Seok...

96
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,872
- My parents raised me with love. - I'm talking right now.

97
00:04:40,105 --> 00:04:43,041
- I'm talking. - Right, you're our guest today.

98
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:47,012
In addition to Min Yong, Bo Mi is here.

99
00:04:47,012 --> 00:04:48,914
It's been so long.

100
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:50,916
- I'm here to eat. - Really?

101
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:54,153
- You lost so much weight. - I'm gaining some back.

102
00:04:54,153 --> 00:04:57,256
- It's time to gain some back. - Is it an off-season?

103
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:59,024
- Yes, it is. - I see.

104
00:04:59,024 --> 00:05:02,628
She's the first female singer who showed off her double chin.

105
00:05:02,628 --> 00:05:04,496
- That's right. - Look at that.

106
00:05:04,496 --> 00:05:06,532
- A lot of it has disappeared. - That's true.

107
00:05:06,532 --> 00:05:08,700
- It's a shame a lot of it is gone. - You look like a toad.

108
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,004
- I'll come back when I have more. - I love Bo Mi.

109
00:05:12,004 --> 00:05:14,206
Min Yong, have you ever met Bo Mi before?

110
00:05:14,206 --> 00:05:15,741
No. This is the first time.

111
00:05:15,741 --> 00:05:17,209
(This is the first time.)

112
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:18,844
What?

113
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:20,879
- Nice to meet you. - Are you serious?

114
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,550
Wouldn't "Flaming Youth" suit Min Yong better?

115
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:27,319
I'll appear on that one soon too.

116
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,520
(He's set for that too.)

117
00:05:28,887 --> 00:05:31,123
- Really? - Are you serious?

118
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:33,425
- He sounds like an old man. - He's like a hermit.

119
00:05:33,425 --> 00:05:35,928
- He lived in a mountain. - Really?

120
00:05:35,928 --> 00:05:37,830
He was like this even when he was young.

121
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:42,501
I still look young. I've only just started.

122
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:46,705
I think it'll be an extraordinary episode.

123
00:05:46,705 --> 00:05:48,507
Are we going to be divided into two teams?

124
00:05:48,507 --> 00:05:51,877
The guests will be given...

125
00:05:51,877 --> 00:05:54,313
very useful hints for the final mission.

126
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:57,850
- Really? - The guests are given hints.

127
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,886
Let's play a game to decide the teams.

128
00:06:00,886 --> 00:06:05,424
The guests will eat something behind a blind. You have to guess...

129
00:06:05,424 --> 00:06:08,327
- what they're eating. - Is that possible?

130
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:11,029
- And the guest will be ours? - I love both.

131
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:12,698
Bo Mi loves food.

132
00:06:12,698 --> 00:06:14,900
It's possible for one team to take both guests.

133
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,935
- Really? - Really?

134
00:06:16,935 --> 00:06:18,637
That's nice.

135
00:06:18,637 --> 00:06:19,872
(Which team will win?)

136
00:06:20,606 --> 00:06:23,375
(Team Jae Seok and Team Jong Kook)

137
00:06:24,042 --> 00:06:27,112
Min Yong will go in...

138
00:06:27,112 --> 00:06:29,748
and eat the food.

139
00:06:29,748 --> 00:06:32,117
The team that guesses it right will take him.

140
00:06:32,117 --> 00:06:36,688
Min Yong's outfit is not appropriate for the show.

141
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:39,224
Min Yong, aren't your pants too short?

142
00:06:39,258 --> 00:06:40,692
- What? - Aren't your pants too short?

143
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,995
- Aren't they shorts? - They're capri pants.

144
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:46,031
Park Jin Young wore them when he sang, "I Have a Girl".

145
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:48,133
Ready.

146
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:49,301
(The games starts.)

147
00:06:49,301 --> 00:06:52,037
- I can see something. - I can't see anything.

148
00:06:52,838 --> 00:06:53,872
Oh, my.

149
00:06:54,673 --> 00:06:55,774
Oh, my.

150
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,143
- Is it something tasty? - It looks tasty.

151
00:06:58,143 --> 00:07:00,112
Is it one of the dishes we tried?

152
00:07:00,112 --> 00:07:03,115
This is too heavy to have in the morning.

153
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,386
(Gimbap)

154
00:07:08,587 --> 00:07:10,923
(With various kinds of vegetables, gimbap is very nutritious.)

155
00:07:11,657 --> 00:07:13,759
I know what food he likes.

156
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,327
- Try it. - Try it.

157
00:07:15,327 --> 00:07:18,897
- It's very fresh. - Okay.

158
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:22,134
You can find this at the fish market.

159
00:07:22,134 --> 00:07:23,602
(Gimbap at the fish market?)

160
00:07:23,602 --> 00:07:26,071
- Really? - It's lobster.

161
00:07:26,104 --> 00:07:27,306
- Wrong. - It's crab.

162
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:30,409
- Wrong. - It's seafood stew.

163
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:33,111
- What are you doing? - It's sashimi.

164
00:07:33,145 --> 00:07:35,581
- Wrong. - He's supposed to eat it.

165
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:38,617
- You should show us. - Open your mouth.

166
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,919
- Open your mouth. - You should show us.

167
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,955
- Eat it. - Good.

168
00:07:42,955 --> 00:07:43,956
(She continuously opens it.)

169
00:07:44,323 --> 00:07:47,159
- Does it taste good? - His mouth is full.

170
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:49,928
It's very delicious.

171
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,431
- It's absolutely delicious. - Ji Hyo, don't you see it?

172
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:54,433
I can't see anything.

173
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:57,603
- Give me a piggyback. - Don't leave it open for too long.

174
00:07:57,603 --> 00:07:58,604
(Jae Seok is on Seok Jin's back.)

175
00:07:58,904 --> 00:08:02,140
- At the Grand Canyon, - Grand Canyon?

176
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,611
- I ate this on the trail. - I've never been there.

177
00:08:06,011 --> 00:08:08,714
- Grand Canyon? - Show us the food.

178
00:08:08,714 --> 00:08:10,415
I'm eating it right now.

179
00:08:10,415 --> 00:08:13,485
- How much does it cost? - What?

180
00:08:13,485 --> 00:08:14,753
Whatever you call is the price.

181
00:08:14,753 --> 00:08:16,688
- I know. - The price must fluctuate.

182
00:08:16,688 --> 00:08:17,756
What do you mean the price is up to the seller?

183
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,791
It's steamed snow crab.

184
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,493
(Your answer is far off.)

185
00:08:21,827 --> 00:08:23,261
- Haha, you're wrong. - I have the answer!

186
00:08:23,261 --> 00:08:25,263
It's ray sea bream.

187
00:08:25,831 --> 00:08:27,099
- What? - What did you say?

188
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:29,401
There's no such fish named that. You meant black sea bream.

189
00:08:29,668 --> 00:08:31,903
- It's black sea bream. - Let him have it.

190
00:08:31,903 --> 00:08:33,372
- The answer is black sea bream. - Hey.

191
00:08:33,372 --> 00:08:35,674
- How could you say that? - The answer is shark's fin.

192
00:08:36,508 --> 00:08:37,743
- Shark's fin? - Yes, it's shark's fin.

193
00:08:37,743 --> 00:08:39,011
(They are far from the correct answer.)

194
00:08:39,011 --> 00:08:41,747
In fact, you can consider this to be one of our national food.

195
00:08:41,747 --> 00:08:44,182
- Really? - His mouth is full with that food.

196
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,651
The answer is gimbap.

197
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:47,819
- That's correct. - Is it really gimbap?

198
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,655
(Kwang Soo gets the right answer.)

199
00:08:49,855 --> 00:08:51,757
You're telling me that people sell gimbap at Grand Canyon?

200
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,026
- Seriously? - How did you know it was gimbap?

201
00:08:54,026 --> 00:08:56,194
- You said it's from a fish market! - How did you figure it out?

202
00:08:57,095 --> 00:08:58,897
- Yes! - No way.

203
00:08:58,897 --> 00:09:00,132
(The answer is gimbap.)

204
00:09:00,132 --> 00:09:02,167
- The red thing was carrot. - I see.

205
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,102
- It was gimbap. - I can't believe it.

206
00:09:04,102 --> 00:09:06,705
- I did have gimbap at Grand Canyon. - Really?

207
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,741
Min Yong, you can join Team Jong Kook.

208
00:09:10,142 --> 00:09:13,478
(Min Yong joins Team Jong Kook after all.)

209
00:09:13,478 --> 00:09:15,280
- I feel like I just got an old man. - We should've gotten him.

210
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,683
- We were supposed to recruit him. - Right. We were supposed to.

211
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,451
Can we take the guest from the other team?

212
00:09:19,451 --> 00:09:20,952
- We have to bring Bo Mi now. - That's right.

213
00:09:20,952 --> 00:09:22,387
- We can also recruit Bo Mi too. - The second...

214
00:09:22,387 --> 00:09:23,789
- Hey, we ought to bring Bo Mi. - You shouldn't be so greedy.

215
00:09:23,789 --> 00:09:26,658
Jae Seok. We must recruit Bo Mi. We really have to get her.

216
00:09:26,825 --> 00:09:28,960
- We have to get this one right. - Let's do this.

217
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,228
- Let's get this right. - All right.

218
00:09:31,229 --> 00:09:35,033
Please reveal the second dish that Bo Mi will eat.

219
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:38,003
- Bo Mi. - Let us see your reaction to it.

220
00:09:38,003 --> 00:09:39,538
- Bo Mi. - This looks delicious.

221
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:40,706
- Talk to us. - Stay quiet.

222
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:42,174
- If you join Jong Kook's team... - You must join our team, Bo Mi.

223
00:09:42,174 --> 00:09:44,376
- I haven't had this for a while. - What?

224
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:46,311
- Really? - Do you like this dish?

225
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:49,047
- Min Yong, let us see her. - Do female idol singers eat that?

226
00:09:49,147 --> 00:09:50,582
- Who? - Female idol singers.

227
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:52,317
- Can they eat that? - Well...

228
00:09:52,317 --> 00:09:53,618
It must be this if she hasn't had if for a while.

229
00:09:53,618 --> 00:09:56,421
- I haven't had this for a while. - This isn't on her diet then.

230
00:09:56,855 --> 00:10:00,292
You can eat this with your hands.

231
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:01,560
It's similar to Indian food.

232
00:10:02,627 --> 00:10:05,831
- There he goes again. - He's lying again.

233
00:10:05,831 --> 00:10:07,199
Why are you lying?

234
00:10:07,332 --> 00:10:09,034
I had this in Mumbai.

235
00:10:09,034 --> 00:10:10,001
Min Yong. Let us see her a bit.

236
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:11,803
- A bit more. - This is your hint.

237
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,772
I will give you another hint.

238
00:10:14,272 --> 00:10:15,674
It's called white food.

239
00:10:15,674 --> 00:10:17,309
- What did you say? - I said this is white food.

240
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:19,878
- Did you say "white" or "fight"? - I said "white".

241
00:10:19,878 --> 00:10:20,979
I have the answer!

242
00:10:20,979 --> 00:10:22,481
- It's dumpling. - That's incorrect.

243
00:10:22,481 --> 00:10:24,382
- He said it's white. - That was close.

244
00:10:24,382 --> 00:10:25,650
- I have the answer! - I got it!

245
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,818
- I yelled first. - It's dim sum.

246
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,153
- Goodness. - Dim sum.

247
00:10:28,153 --> 00:10:30,555
- He said it first. - Yes!

248
00:10:30,555 --> 00:10:31,723
What is your answer, Haha?

249
00:10:31,723 --> 00:10:34,326
- It's dim sum. - It wasn't his turn.

250
00:10:34,326 --> 00:10:35,327
It was my turn.

251
00:10:35,327 --> 00:10:37,662
- He said it first. - The answer is dim sum.

252
00:10:37,662 --> 00:10:39,931
- It's dim sum. - No, Haha yelled out first.

253
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,334
- I really did call out first. - It's spelled...

254
00:10:43,502 --> 00:10:45,537
(You're so greedy. Why are you doing this to us?)

255
00:10:45,537 --> 00:10:47,906
- Do rock-paper-scissors to settle. - He said, "dim sum".

256
00:10:47,906 --> 00:10:49,174
- He said, "dim sum". - All right. Then...

257
00:10:49,174 --> 00:10:51,476
- Let's do rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors?

258
00:10:51,476 --> 00:10:53,311
- The winning team can answer first. - But we were first.

259
00:10:54,146 --> 00:10:55,947
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

260
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,549
- Rock-paper-scissors. - All right. He won.

261
00:10:57,549 --> 00:10:59,017
- Rock-paper-scissors. - I lost.

262
00:10:59,184 --> 00:11:00,619
- Rock-paper-scissors. - I won!

263
00:11:01,052 --> 00:11:02,354
What is the answer?

264
00:11:02,354 --> 00:11:05,123
(Seok Jin earns the opportunity to say his answer first.)

265
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,491
- It's dim sum. - That's incorrect.

266
00:11:07,092 --> 00:11:08,527
(Incorrect!)

267
00:11:08,527 --> 00:11:10,495
What are you doing? It's not dim sum?

268
00:11:10,495 --> 00:11:11,797
(It wasn't correct?)

269
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:14,032
- What did you say? - What did you make us play then?

270
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:15,834
- Hey. - He's doing his job well.

271
00:11:16,101 --> 00:11:17,903
Why did you do that? I'm so annoyed.

272
00:11:18,703 --> 00:11:21,139
Pulling pranks is my area of expertise.

273
00:11:21,406 --> 00:11:24,242
- You're making me mad. - I will give you a crucial hint.

274
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,778
There are two kinds of this food.

275
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,514
You have to be fast for this.

276
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,384
- Fertilized and unfertilized. - I have the answer!

277
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,019
I know the answer! I got it.

278
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:35,287
- I figured it out. - What is it?

279
00:11:35,287 --> 00:11:36,354
Be quiet.

280
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,291
What are you doing?

281
00:11:39,558 --> 00:11:40,725
- Stop that. - Go over there.

282
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,961
- Why? Tell us. - Go and stay there.

283
00:11:43,128 --> 00:11:44,429
- Tell us the answer. - What is it?

284
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:45,864
- What is the answer? - Get lost.

285
00:11:45,864 --> 00:11:47,032
It's boiled egg.

286
00:11:47,032 --> 00:11:49,534
(Ji Hyo's answer is boiled egg.)

287
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:50,635
That's correct!

288
00:11:50,635 --> 00:11:51,736
(Ji Hyo gets it right.)

289
00:11:51,736 --> 00:11:54,105
- That's it. Bo Mi. Come to us. - Come on.

290
00:11:54,105 --> 00:11:56,041
Why would you eat this in Mumbai though?

291
00:11:56,908 --> 00:11:59,077
- Boiled eggs are sold in India too. - Let's switch.

292
00:11:59,477 --> 00:12:01,813
- Is there a chance to switch him? - In Mumbai...

293
00:12:01,813 --> 00:12:03,215
Can you give us a chance to switch him out?

294
00:12:03,215 --> 00:12:04,716
- Let us switch. - Please let us!

295
00:12:04,716 --> 00:12:06,017
- No, you can't! - I can't work with him.

296
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,319
I'm not going to be in this then!

297
00:12:08,954 --> 00:12:10,555
- Let us change the guests. - He's really unhappy about that.

298
00:12:10,555 --> 00:12:12,290
- Let us switch. - You can't do that.

299
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,892
- I can't work with him. - It's not that we don't like him.

300
00:12:13,892 --> 00:12:15,293
- We just want to work with Bo Mi. - If you insist...

301
00:12:15,393 --> 00:12:17,095
- You can't do that. - What about us then?

302
00:12:17,095 --> 00:12:19,831
- I'm begging you. Just this once. - I won't work if you don't let us!

303
00:12:19,831 --> 00:12:21,933
- I will take care of Jong Kook. - We are happy with Bo Mi.

304
00:12:21,933 --> 00:12:24,703
- I will do whatever you want. - We are happy with Bo Mi.

305
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,771
How can I handle Jong Kook and Min Yong together?

306
00:12:27,105 --> 00:12:29,140
- Switch guests! - This isn't right.

307
00:12:29,341 --> 00:12:31,643
- We like Min Yong. - Right. Min Yong is great.

308
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:34,546
- How about this? Let's do this. - All right.

309
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,548
- Let Bo Mi choose her team. - Right. Let her pick.

310
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,617
- She can join the team she wants. - All right.

311
00:12:38,617 --> 00:12:41,286
Will she want a younger or older team?

312
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,154
Can we do that?

313
00:12:43,154 --> 00:12:44,823
(Bo Mi, join the younger team.)

314
00:12:44,823 --> 00:12:46,324
What do you want to do?

315
00:12:46,324 --> 00:12:47,592
- Choose one team. - Well...

316
00:12:47,592 --> 00:12:50,295
- Bo Mi. Do you want to stay or go? - We starred on a show together.

317
00:12:50,295 --> 00:12:52,497
- Bo Mi. - We have our own chat room.

318
00:12:52,497 --> 00:12:54,833
- We really do, Bo Mi. - Which team do you want?

319
00:12:54,933 --> 00:12:56,601
- Me? - Bo Mi, everyone here is young.

320
00:12:56,701 --> 00:12:58,536
- I like both teams. - All right.

321
00:12:59,004 --> 00:13:00,305
- Come to our team, Bo Mi! - Will you be okay?

322
00:13:00,505 --> 00:13:02,841
- Bo Mi! - I'll switch since they're younger.

323
00:13:02,841 --> 00:13:04,609
That's right!

324
00:13:05,877 --> 00:13:07,279
(They complete trading the guests.)

325
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,315
- Come here. - Welcome, Min Yong.

326
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:12,150
(Laughing)

327
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,752
It doesn't matter if we lose now.

328
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:14,920
That's it.

329
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,857
In our team, you can play the role of Kwang Soo.

330
00:13:19,124 --> 00:13:20,825
- Did you get that? - You are tall too.

331
00:13:20,892 --> 00:13:22,294
- And... - He's tall too.

332
00:13:22,294 --> 00:13:24,529
- Ji Hyo can play Bo Mi's role. - I'm excited.

333
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:26,331
Just because I'm tall, I don't act like him.

334
00:13:26,331 --> 00:13:27,332
"Like him"?

335
00:13:27,532 --> 00:13:29,601
- What do you mean by that? - He's complicated.

336
00:13:29,901 --> 00:13:31,403
(Being tall and unlucky at the same time is complicated.)

337
00:13:31,403 --> 00:13:32,904
- Unbelievable. - He's tall indeed.

338
00:13:32,904 --> 00:13:37,142
Today, you'll visit restaurants recommended by the members.

339
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:39,911
You will have to unravel the secrets along the way.

340
00:13:40,512 --> 00:13:44,249
A team game will decide the winning and losing team at each restaurant.

341
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:49,087
The winning team will earn benefits as well as hints.

342
00:13:49,087 --> 00:13:53,058
We will start "Running Man's Food Guide" now. Let us begin!

343
00:13:53,058 --> 00:13:54,793
(They set out to dig up the secrets.)

344
00:13:56,528 --> 00:13:57,729
This is nice.

345
00:13:57,729 --> 00:13:59,931
(They'll try braised spicy chicken, small octopus, eel, and bulgogi.)

346
00:14:00,498 --> 00:14:01,800
What should we eat first?

347
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,103
- I picked this restaurant. - Where?

348
00:14:05,103 --> 00:14:08,239
- Is this one in Samseong-dong? - It's bulgogi.

349
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:10,742
This is bulgogi, but this isn't your regular bulgogi.

350
00:14:10,742 --> 00:14:12,143
(It's a classy transformation of bulgogi.)

351
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,812
We can grill it on this.

352
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:16,047
This is similar to shabu shabu.

353
00:14:16,047 --> 00:14:17,549
Look. That looks delicious.

354
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,217
- This looks tasty. - Bulgogi...

355
00:14:20,885 --> 00:14:24,322
Kwang Soo often goes to this restaurant.

356
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:27,192
- He takes girls there on a date. - Look at that.

357
00:14:27,225 --> 00:14:28,827
- That's how he knows... - What are you saying?

358
00:14:28,893 --> 00:14:30,395
- a lot of good restaurants. - No, I just like delicious food.

359
00:14:30,395 --> 00:14:32,831
The girls who went there with him must feel betrayed...

360
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:35,300
- What are you saying? - when they watch this.

361
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,503
- How many girls did you take there? - I bet there are at least four...

362
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:43,208
- girls who went there with him. - It's not true. Don't be mistaken.

363
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:46,311
- Don't be mistaken. - I got my hair done at a salon.

364
00:14:46,611 --> 00:14:47,779
What?

365
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:49,514
(What did you say that out of the blue?)

366
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:51,116
- I mean... - Let me tell you about him.

367
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:53,752
- He only thinks about himself. - He was touching my hair.

368
00:14:54,819 --> 00:14:57,555
- Does he have his own show? - He only thinks about himself.

369
00:14:57,555 --> 00:15:00,692
This camera is filming Bo Mi and me together.

370
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:02,994
I thought we could have our own conversation.

371
00:15:03,261 --> 00:15:07,332
I haven't seen anyone pull up the collar since my school teacher.

372
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,200
Really. Not that many people do this.

373
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,803
People pull up their collar not to get the back of their neck tanned.

374
00:15:11,903 --> 00:15:13,638
That's why gym teachers do this...

375
00:15:13,638 --> 00:15:15,440
- since they stay outdoor a lot. - He even curled it a bit.

376
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,443
- He was a gym teacher on a sitcom. - There's a reason why we have this.

377
00:15:18,443 --> 00:15:20,645
He does look like a PE teacher though.

378
00:15:20,645 --> 00:15:22,447
- He played a role of a gym teacher. - Right, he does look like one.

379
00:15:22,447 --> 00:15:25,016
- I can't stop playing that role. - He was...

380
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,152
You can't stop playing it? Stop exaggerating.

381
00:15:27,152 --> 00:15:28,586
He's still in the process of assimilating into the present.

382
00:15:28,586 --> 00:15:29,754
(They are on the way to the first course.)

383
00:15:30,755 --> 00:15:33,091
(Kwang Soo's choice in Samseong-dong, Gangnam)

384
00:15:33,091 --> 00:15:35,794
- Hello. - Hi.

385
00:15:35,794 --> 00:15:36,928
- Look at this. - Hello.

386
00:15:36,928 --> 00:15:38,830
(It's the perfect pair of vegetables and beef.)

387
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,732
- Hello. - This is similar to shabu shabu.

388
00:15:41,132 --> 00:15:42,634
- This is shabu shabu. - Goodness.

389
00:15:42,634 --> 00:15:44,002
- What is this? - This looks great.

390
00:15:44,002 --> 00:15:45,203
(The first restaurant of the tour guide)

391
00:15:45,203 --> 00:15:46,738
- It's bulgogi. - This looks delicious.

392
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,106
- This bulgogi looks different. - It will be so tasty.

393
00:15:48,106 --> 00:15:51,176
- They won't give it to all of us. - Is that it?

394
00:15:52,177 --> 00:15:54,145
The first restaurant of "Running Man's Food Guide" is...

395
00:15:54,813 --> 00:15:56,781
a bulgogi stew restaurant...

396
00:15:57,182 --> 00:15:59,584
- recommended by Kwang Soo. - This is excellent.

397
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:03,588
It is the restaurant that Kwang Soo came with the lady he was dating.

398
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,690
No, it's not true. I didn't.

399
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,826
- The owner will know. - It's not that.

400
00:16:07,826 --> 00:16:10,095
This place is famous for beef soup...

401
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,097
- and bulgogi as well. - Beef soup?

402
00:16:12,363 --> 00:16:14,532
The bulgogi meat is like a round ball.

403
00:16:14,632 --> 00:16:16,401
I think this is very unique.

404
00:16:16,401 --> 00:16:18,002
You can pop it into your mouth at once.

405
00:16:18,036 --> 00:16:19,637
I am going to be impartial when I review the food.

406
00:16:19,637 --> 00:16:21,039
I'm confident about the food.

407
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:24,943
The winning team of the game will only...

408
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,278
(Only the winning team will eat.)

409
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,247
eat the food.

410
00:16:30,148 --> 00:16:32,250
The game you will play at this restaurant is...

411
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:36,955
that I will show you an enlarged picture of a dish...

412
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:39,724
- We have to guess the dish, right? - Right. You have to guess it.

413
00:16:39,757 --> 00:16:40,758
- It's a dish? - Yes.

414
00:16:40,758 --> 00:16:42,026
- It won't be easy. - I am an expert.

415
00:16:42,026 --> 00:16:44,929
There is a special buzzer for this game.

416
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:48,800
To ring the buzzer, you have to get the other team to talk.

417
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,336
(The buzzer is the opponent's voice.)

418
00:16:51,336 --> 00:16:52,537
Can I hit their vocal cord?

419
00:16:53,104 --> 00:16:54,272
How could you say that?

420
00:16:54,272 --> 00:16:56,708
The opponent's voice will be the buzzer.

421
00:16:57,642 --> 00:17:00,645
(The team that wins 2 rounds out of 3 will win the game.)

422
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:03,648
Please select one player from each team.

423
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:04,749
Whom should we pick?

424
00:17:04,749 --> 00:17:07,018
We must show our strength in the first round. You must play.

425
00:17:07,185 --> 00:17:08,620
- No. - Should Bo Mi go first?

426
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,921
- Me? - Why don't you go first, Bo Mi?

427
00:17:09,921 --> 00:17:10,922
Bo Mi is first?

428
00:17:10,922 --> 00:17:12,023
(Bo Mi will play first.)

429
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:13,725
Then Seok Jin will play.

430
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:16,127
- Seriously? - Why are you doing that to us?

431
00:17:16,127 --> 00:17:18,363
- He doesn't go easy on women. - I won't go easy on you.

432
00:17:18,363 --> 00:17:19,931
- It's so big. - He only...

433
00:17:19,931 --> 00:17:22,400
- He only cares about winning. - I won't go easy on you.

434
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,602
I don't know anything about Apink.

435
00:17:25,236 --> 00:17:27,138
(Round 1, Bo Mi versus Seok Jin)

436
00:17:27,739 --> 00:17:29,474
- Here is the first question. - All right.

437
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:33,878
(What is this dish?)

438
00:17:34,612 --> 00:17:36,614
- What is this? - Can't you recognize it right away?

439
00:17:36,714 --> 00:17:38,283
(What is that red thing?)

440
00:17:38,449 --> 00:17:39,918
- Shall I give you a hint? - Please do so.

441
00:17:40,418 --> 00:17:42,387
The hint is kimchi.

442
00:17:44,122 --> 00:17:46,524
- Get ready. - There are a lot of sesame.

443
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:47,792
- Start! - Really?

444
00:17:47,792 --> 00:17:49,160
(Pinching hard)

445
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:52,096
(Their passion to ring the buzzer is tremendous.)

446
00:17:52,096 --> 00:17:53,598
Look. Seok Jin is clenching his teeth.

447
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:56,901
(Pulling)

448
00:17:58,102 --> 00:18:02,040
(They will answer the question first when the opponent makes a sound.)

449
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,975
- Bo Mi is really trying too. - She is.

450
00:18:03,975 --> 00:18:05,276
Both of them are playing this wholeheartedly.

451
00:18:05,276 --> 00:18:06,444
Bo Mi is no joke too.

452
00:18:06,477 --> 00:18:07,912
(She doesn't go easy on him.)

453
00:18:07,946 --> 00:18:09,280
(Pinching)

454
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:13,351
(He targets her lower jaw which is her weak spot.)

455
00:18:13,484 --> 00:18:14,986
Bo Mi, show your taekwondo moves.

456
00:18:15,186 --> 00:18:16,454
Bo Mi, kick him!

457
00:18:16,454 --> 00:18:18,423
- Kick him. - That's right.

458
00:18:18,423 --> 00:18:20,225
Attack him.

459
00:18:20,525 --> 00:18:21,926
(They struggle.)

460
00:18:21,926 --> 00:18:23,027
(Let go of my hair.)

461
00:18:24,028 --> 00:18:27,131
(She pulls out a chunk of his hair.)

462
00:18:27,432 --> 00:18:30,501
(Each strand of hair is precious at his age.)

463
00:18:30,501 --> 00:18:31,936
Bo Mi pulled out his hair.

464
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:35,573
(Seok Jin cries without a sound.)

465
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,375
What happened?

466
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,077
- You pulled out so much. - Bo Mi.

467
00:18:39,143 --> 00:18:41,112
(It's not like she can implant the hair back.)

468
00:18:41,112 --> 00:18:43,748
Go and wash your hands. What's this?

469
00:18:44,182 --> 00:18:46,551
(Seok Jin can't take back his hair.)

470
00:18:47,051 --> 00:18:48,286
- Bo Mi's hands are dirty. - Bo Mi.

471
00:18:48,286 --> 00:18:50,622
- Her hands are dirty. - That's a lot of hair.

472
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:53,191
(Her hands are dirty.)

473
00:18:53,191 --> 00:18:54,759
Go and wash your hands.

474
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:56,628
- Use wet tissue. - Do you have wet tissue?

475
00:18:56,628 --> 00:18:58,563
- Did her hands get dirty? - Yes.

476
00:18:59,364 --> 00:19:02,033
(She exposed his scalp by force.)

477
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:03,401
(I still didn't make any sound.)

478
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:06,437
- Bo Mi, use taekwondo. - Kick him.

479
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:07,639
Just kick him.

480
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:09,674
You can do it, Bo Mi.

481
00:19:09,674 --> 00:19:11,342
- Let's take turns. - Take turns?

482
00:19:11,342 --> 00:19:13,911
- You can do it, Bo Mi. - Let's take turns.

483
00:19:13,911 --> 00:19:15,580
- Okay. - Take turns in hitting.

484
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,914
(Don't worry.)

485
00:19:17,015 --> 00:19:19,617
- Okay. - What?

486
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,319
(She kicks him hard.)

487
00:19:22,353 --> 00:19:26,224
(She attacks him with her leg.)

488
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:31,129
(Everyone gives a standing ovation.)

489
00:19:31,829 --> 00:19:32,897
(He's completely embarrassed.)

490
00:19:32,897 --> 00:19:35,333
Bo Mi gets her turn first.

491
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,868
- She goes first. - Good job.

492
00:19:36,868 --> 00:19:39,704
(Bo Mi is good at taekwondo.)

493
00:19:40,071 --> 00:19:42,173
(They all feel pity on him.)

494
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:44,309
- She goes first. - Good job.

495
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:46,177
(Seok Jin loses.)

496
00:19:46,277 --> 00:19:48,212
She's good at kicking.

497
00:19:48,212 --> 00:19:50,081
- Go ahead. - She's charming.

498
00:19:50,081 --> 00:19:52,116
- Go, Bo Mi. - She's awesome.

499
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,985
(He gives in.)

500
00:19:54,252 --> 00:19:55,987
- It's Bo Mi's turn. - Go ahead.

501
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:58,089
It's your turn, Bo Mi.

502
00:19:58,089 --> 00:19:59,157
(What could it be?)

503
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:01,859
- Do you know the answer? - In 5, 4...

504
00:20:03,127 --> 00:20:05,163
Kimchi is the hint.

505
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:09,200
(It's a dish made with kimchi.)

506
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,535
It's kimchi jeon.

507
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:15,873
(Is it a photo of kimchi jeon?)

508
00:20:15,873 --> 00:20:17,041
That's correct.

509
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,976
(Bo Mi is correct.)

510
00:20:18,976 --> 00:20:20,345
Is that kimchi jeon?

511
00:20:20,712 --> 00:20:21,946
Good job.

512
00:20:21,946 --> 00:20:23,881
- Really? - It's kimchi jeon.

513
00:20:23,881 --> 00:20:25,283
- Right. - It looks like stew.

514
00:20:25,283 --> 00:20:27,085
- Bo Mi. - It's oily.

515
00:20:27,085 --> 00:20:28,353
- Are you okay? - Yes.

516
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:30,388
Are you sure? I'm sorry.

517
00:20:30,388 --> 00:20:31,789
Next up is Min Yong.

518
00:20:31,923 --> 00:20:34,025
- I'm okay. - Come on, Min Yong.

519
00:20:34,092 --> 00:20:35,259
Haha is up next.

520
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:37,428
(It's a match between Min Yong and Haha.)

521
00:20:38,396 --> 00:20:41,032
(Round 2, Haha versus Min Yong)

522
00:20:41,232 --> 00:20:42,433
Here's the photo.

523
00:20:42,433 --> 00:20:44,102
(It's the second question.)

524
00:20:44,102 --> 00:20:47,505
(What kind of dish is this?)

525
00:20:47,939 --> 00:20:49,006
Hey.

526
00:20:49,006 --> 00:20:50,074
(He reaches out.)

527
00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:52,877
(Haha suddenly attacks Min Yong's private part.)

528
00:20:53,678 --> 00:20:54,979
What are you doing?

529
00:20:54,979 --> 00:20:57,215
(The two old men play like children.)

530
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,649
What are you doing?

531
00:20:59,784 --> 00:21:01,552
It'll be blurred on TV.

532
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:02,854
(They can't help but look.)

533
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:05,890
(He locks his head angrily.)

534
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,258
(Haha laughs.)

535
00:21:07,258 --> 00:21:09,293
- Haha made a sound. - I heard it.

536
00:21:09,293 --> 00:21:10,628
It's Min Yong's turn.

537
00:21:10,628 --> 00:21:11,963
I endured it for too long.

538
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:13,698
My goodness.

539
00:21:13,698 --> 00:21:14,899
Go ahead, Min Yong.

540
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:17,001
(His best friend has given him unspeakable pain.)

541
00:21:17,001 --> 00:21:18,703
How could he endure that?

542
00:21:19,103 --> 00:21:20,505
Min Yong, are you okay?

543
00:21:20,605 --> 00:21:23,307
(He doesn't know how to explain the pain he's in.)

544
00:21:23,341 --> 00:21:25,143
- Are you okay? - Min Yong.

545
00:21:25,143 --> 00:21:27,044
- Min Yong, are you okay? - How did you endure it?

546
00:21:27,044 --> 00:21:29,046
It looked too painful to stay silent.

547
00:21:29,046 --> 00:21:31,783
Are you okay? You look pale.

548
00:21:32,216 --> 00:21:33,985
I'm not even married yet.

549
00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:36,921
Gosh, how did he endure the pain?

550
00:21:38,356 --> 00:21:39,624
I pinched it hard.

551
00:21:40,391 --> 00:21:41,559
You look exactly like your mother.

552
00:21:42,293 --> 00:21:44,162
Long time no see.

553
00:21:44,328 --> 00:21:46,531
- I hope all goes well. - Ma'am?

554
00:21:46,731 --> 00:21:48,199
You look exactly like her.

555
00:21:48,199 --> 00:21:50,001
(Min Yong gets his turn.)

556
00:21:50,001 --> 00:21:51,936
- What's the answer? - Let me take a break.

557
00:21:52,336 --> 00:21:54,505
- I can't calm down. - Go.

558
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,574
- Just answer it. - I almost got it.

559
00:21:56,574 --> 00:21:57,608
That's easy.

560
00:21:57,608 --> 00:22:00,344
- My answer is raw octopus. - That's right.

561
00:22:00,344 --> 00:22:01,579
- Raw octopus? - Yes.

562
00:22:01,579 --> 00:22:03,247
(Is it correct?)

563
00:22:03,247 --> 00:22:04,415
(He's correct.)

564
00:22:04,415 --> 00:22:05,516
That's correct.

565
00:22:06,184 --> 00:22:07,385
- That was easy. - It was.

566
00:22:07,385 --> 00:22:08,920
It was too easy.

567
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,023
- It's too bad. - The answer was obvious.

568
00:22:12,023 --> 00:22:13,491
Are you okay?

569
00:22:14,025 --> 00:22:15,426
I need to use the restroom.

570
00:22:15,426 --> 00:22:17,261
- Are you bleeding? - I think so.

571
00:22:17,261 --> 00:22:19,030
(It feels warm in his pants.)

572
00:22:19,597 --> 00:22:22,033
(Next is Jong Kook versus Jae Seok.)

573
00:22:22,233 --> 00:22:24,635
- Jae Seok. - This is the final round.

574
00:22:24,735 --> 00:22:26,404
- Is it the final round? - You can do it.

575
00:22:26,504 --> 00:22:27,805
I bet it'll be difficult.

576
00:22:28,406 --> 00:22:29,474
Here's the photo.

577
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:30,541
(It's the third question.)

578
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:34,111
(What kind of dish is this?)

579
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:35,880
(Jae Seok attacks.)

580
00:22:36,714 --> 00:22:38,616
(He bites.)

581
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,853
(Jong Kook starts to warm up.)

582
00:22:41,853 --> 00:22:42,854
He's in trouble.

583
00:22:42,854 --> 00:22:44,355
(Jong Kook throws him.)

584
00:22:44,355 --> 00:22:45,690
- The real fight starts now. - Hey.

585
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:46,858
He made a sound.

586
00:22:46,924 --> 00:22:49,026
Come on. You can't do this.

587
00:22:49,193 --> 00:22:51,195
He can't throw me against the wall.

588
00:22:51,362 --> 00:22:52,463
What is it?

589
00:22:52,463 --> 00:22:53,931
Aren't they rice cakes?

590
00:22:54,131 --> 00:22:56,434
(Can they be rice cakes?)

591
00:22:56,701 --> 00:22:58,603
It's incorrect.

592
00:22:59,103 --> 00:23:00,538
(Jae Seok is happy.)

593
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:03,541
(Did you step on my foot?)

594
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:05,109
(He laughs out loud.)

595
00:23:06,143 --> 00:23:08,546
(Jong Kook gets his turn again.)

596
00:23:08,646 --> 00:23:09,981
Gosh, I don't believe it.

597
00:23:09,981 --> 00:23:11,816
(What could it be?)

598
00:23:12,216 --> 00:23:14,519
Just answer it since it'll always be your turn.

599
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,053
- That's right. - This is annoying.

600
00:23:16,053 --> 00:23:18,890
Is it mandu?

601
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:21,859
(It's something white and mysterious.)

602
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:25,363
(Can it be mandu instead of rice cakes?)

603
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:26,831
- That's correct. - What?

604
00:23:26,898 --> 00:23:27,932
(Jong Kook gets it right.)

605
00:23:27,999 --> 00:23:30,201
- How can it be mandu? - We won.

606
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:32,403
(Jong Kook answers the most difficult question.)

607
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:33,738
- It's mandu. - Goodness.

608
00:23:33,738 --> 00:23:35,606
- We won. - It's obviously mandu.

609
00:23:35,606 --> 00:23:37,141
I thought it was rice.

610
00:23:37,141 --> 00:23:38,276
(This is the actual photo.)

611
00:23:38,676 --> 00:23:41,178
(Jong Kook's team gets to taste the bulgogi.)

612
00:23:41,178 --> 00:23:42,580
- Shall we start? - Is it ready to eat?

613
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,549
- Yes. - Thank you.

614
00:23:45,249 --> 00:23:47,451
(Boiling broth and moist meat create the best harmony.)

615
00:23:47,451 --> 00:23:49,186
That's how you eat it.

616
00:23:49,987 --> 00:23:51,522
It's quite unique.

617
00:23:51,522 --> 00:23:54,025
(What's the secret hidden in this dish?)

618
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,394
(Blowing)

619
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:57,528
(She opens her mouth wide.)

620
00:23:57,528 --> 00:23:59,430
Don't pretend to be considerate.

621
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,632
- Thank you. - Help yourselves.

622
00:24:01,632 --> 00:24:02,800
(Isn't it delicious?)

623
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,101
Is that rice?

624
00:24:04,101 --> 00:24:06,337
(He tastes some seasoned raw beef.)

625
00:24:06,337 --> 00:24:07,605
It's really delicious.

626
00:24:07,605 --> 00:24:10,207
Don't be disappointed that you can't eat it.

627
00:24:10,207 --> 00:24:11,609
(He makes fun of the others.)

628
00:24:11,609 --> 00:24:13,578
My goodness.

629
00:24:13,844 --> 00:24:14,912
Gosh.

630
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:16,414
(Is it delicious?)

631
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:17,748
It smells so good.

632
00:24:17,982 --> 00:24:19,150
Here you go.

633
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,384
What's this?

634
00:24:20,484 --> 00:24:22,153
It's an avocado.

635
00:24:22,153 --> 00:24:23,220
Isn't that an avocado?

636
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,590
(Why is there an avocado?)

637
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:27,858
- Do we share it? - Yes.

638
00:24:27,892 --> 00:24:29,560
Take a bite each.

639
00:24:29,961 --> 00:24:32,196
It's like butter from a tree.

640
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,798
- Is that so? - Yes.

641
00:24:33,798 --> 00:24:36,901
(Avocado is a soft fruit with a lot of vitamins.)

642
00:24:37,702 --> 00:24:42,306
(They can't help but look at the bulgogi.)

643
00:24:43,307 --> 00:24:47,979
May I get a bite after Bo Mi kicks me again?

644
00:24:47,979 --> 00:24:50,147
Sure, go ahead.

645
00:24:50,514 --> 00:24:52,550
(Do I have to kick him again?)

646
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,352
Jae Seok, take a bite.

647
00:24:54,352 --> 00:24:56,954
(He offers a bite to Jae Seok.)

648
00:24:57,488 --> 00:25:01,258
(Her kick could even break your leg.)

649
00:25:01,258 --> 00:25:02,293
Bo Mi.

650
00:25:03,394 --> 00:25:08,733
(Is getting a kick worth it to taste some bulgogi?)

651
00:25:08,733 --> 00:25:11,402
You can get two pieces.

652
00:25:11,402 --> 00:25:12,937
Really? That sounds good.

653
00:25:12,937 --> 00:25:14,672
(Everyone wants to get kicked.)

654
00:25:15,272 --> 00:25:16,507
What are you doing?

655
00:25:16,507 --> 00:25:19,410
My legs can't function properly today anyway.

656
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:21,379
(He's already given up on his lower body.)

657
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,114
You'll find out after getting kicked.

658
00:25:23,414 --> 00:25:25,716
Do you promise to give us two pieces?

659
00:25:25,716 --> 00:25:27,118
- How about this side? - Yes, two pieces.

660
00:25:27,118 --> 00:25:28,219
She's smart.

661
00:25:28,386 --> 00:25:29,720
(She takes her pose.)

662
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,222
I have red belt in taekwondo.

663
00:25:32,189 --> 00:25:34,358
(She kicks.)

664
00:25:34,392 --> 00:25:37,395
(She kicks him hard.)

665
00:25:38,429 --> 00:25:42,533
(Min Yong's determination for bulgogi deserves respect.)

666
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,403
- I'm really sorry. - Min Yong is in pain.

667
00:25:45,403 --> 00:25:46,704
You can eat now.

668
00:25:46,704 --> 00:25:48,639
- Bo Mi can kick. - Please eat.

669
00:25:48,739 --> 00:25:50,408
Think about something else.

670
00:25:50,574 --> 00:25:52,143
Bo Mi's kicks are impressive.

671
00:25:52,143 --> 00:25:53,878
Jae Seok seems nervous.

672
00:25:53,878 --> 00:25:56,247
- To be honest, I'm scared. - Go ahead.

673
00:25:56,647 --> 00:25:58,215
- He looks scared. - Try it.

674
00:25:58,215 --> 00:25:59,450
She moves forward as she kicks.

675
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:02,486
(Thud)

676
00:26:03,654 --> 00:26:08,192
(Enjoy your bulgogi.)

677
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:11,395
(He lies down immediately.)

678
00:26:11,629 --> 00:26:12,930
(He trembles in pain.)

679
00:26:13,998 --> 00:26:15,933
(He feels it in his whole body.)

680
00:26:16,434 --> 00:26:18,135
Good job, Bo Mi.

681
00:26:19,737 --> 00:26:22,373
I'll eat Jae Seok's bulgogi.

682
00:26:24,608 --> 00:26:25,676
Goodness.

683
00:26:25,676 --> 00:26:26,977
(Isn't that mine?)

684
00:26:26,977 --> 00:26:28,779
- Why are you eating mine? - It's gone.

685
00:26:28,779 --> 00:26:30,014
Why are you eating?

686
00:26:30,014 --> 00:26:32,550
(You can't taste this bulgogi anywhere else.)

687
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:35,319
Team Jong Kook wins the first round.

688
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:36,320
(Team Jong Kook wins.)

689
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,757
Here are the two items related to Food Guide's secret.

690
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,859
You ate rice and barley.

691
00:26:41,859 --> 00:26:43,294
Here are rice and barley.

692
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:45,362
Are these hints?

693
00:26:45,563 --> 00:26:47,398
Team Jae Seok lost.

694
00:26:47,498 --> 00:26:49,133
- You had an avocado. - Yes.

695
00:26:49,133 --> 00:26:50,534
Here's another avocado.

696
00:26:50,634 --> 00:26:52,603
- The number of items is important. - Really?

697
00:26:53,003 --> 00:26:55,740
(Is the number of items important?)

698
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:59,477
(Team Jae Seok gets an avocado. Team Jong Kook gets rice and barley.)

699
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:00,711
Bo Mi.

700
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:02,947
You must be feeling good since you ate tasty food and relieved stress.

701
00:27:02,947 --> 00:27:05,182
- Yes. - Did you relieve stress?

702
00:27:05,282 --> 00:27:06,751
Bo Mi, you look better.

703
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:08,719
- You look much better. - You really do.

704
00:27:08,786 --> 00:27:10,254
Was it painful?

705
00:27:10,654 --> 00:27:12,289
I can't walk properly.

706
00:27:12,289 --> 00:27:13,691
(Seok Jin is the most impressed.)

707
00:27:13,891 --> 00:27:16,327
I've never kicked someone so hard.

708
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:18,295
This can't be your first time.

709
00:27:18,295 --> 00:27:20,131
- No, it really is. - Are you sure?

710
00:27:20,197 --> 00:27:21,532
Are we going to eat again?

711
00:27:21,532 --> 00:27:23,901
I thought she said she'd kick again.

712
00:27:24,335 --> 00:27:26,036
- I misheard her. - He's traumatized.

713
00:27:26,036 --> 00:27:27,505
"Shall I kick you again?"

714
00:27:28,038 --> 00:27:30,141
I think she'll kick you four times minimum.

715
00:27:30,474 --> 00:27:32,276
Bo Mi is making me upset.

716
00:27:32,576 --> 00:27:34,378
- She is. - I like Bo Mi.

717
00:27:34,378 --> 00:27:35,479
(It's a new side of her.)

718
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:36,814
I like her more than before.

719
00:27:37,715 --> 00:27:39,650
(Which restaurant did Haha recommend?)

720
00:27:39,717 --> 00:27:41,886
Come on, we can win.

721
00:27:42,253 --> 00:27:45,055
(Next is a small octopus restaurant.)

722
00:27:46,557 --> 00:27:47,758
(Haha's choice in Sinsa-dong, Gangnam)

723
00:27:47,758 --> 00:27:50,127
- We've been here a lot. - It was such a long time ago.

724
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:53,130
- It's been a long time. - The food is delicious.

725
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,933
- There was a long line before. - I've only tried the squid.

726
00:27:55,933 --> 00:27:58,702
- Was there a long wait before? - Yes.

727
00:27:58,803 --> 00:28:00,871
This restaurant is recommended by Haha.

728
00:28:01,005 --> 00:28:03,007
It's the second restaurant for "Running Man's Food Guide".

729
00:28:03,274 --> 00:28:05,810
It's famous for small octopuses.

730
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,978
(It's famous for spicy small octopuses with 28 years of history.)

731
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:10,614
(It's sweet and spicy small octopus bulgogi.)

732
00:28:10,781 --> 00:28:11,849
This place...

733
00:28:11,849 --> 00:28:15,085
- has been here since the 90s. - It's legendary.

734
00:28:15,085 --> 00:28:16,220
I came here often before.

735
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:19,857
I used to come here and the sausage stew restaurant often.

736
00:28:19,857 --> 00:28:21,859
People came here a lot.

737
00:28:21,859 --> 00:28:25,596
This time, you first need to enjoy all the bulgogi in front of you.

738
00:28:25,596 --> 00:28:27,531
- Really? - My goodness.

739
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:31,101
(There's no mission?)

740
00:28:32,203 --> 00:28:36,540
(You're going to let us eat this with no strings attached?)

741
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:41,846
(It's too good to be true.)

742
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:45,282
- Can we get some rice? - This goes great with rice.

743
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:46,917
(They soon forget about being suspicious.)

744
00:28:47,484 --> 00:28:49,787
- Do you know what this is? - This tastes great.

745
00:28:49,787 --> 00:28:52,156
- The sauce tastes great. - It's been so long.

746
00:28:52,156 --> 00:28:54,325
- I haven't had this for so long. - Yes.

747
00:28:54,325 --> 00:28:57,161
- I came here often with Haha. - That's right.

748
00:28:57,161 --> 00:28:59,230
We used to come here with good friends.

749
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:04,201
I didn't know Min Yong would join us today. I used to eat here with him.

750
00:29:04,802 --> 00:29:07,371
(They were poor, but they were best friends.)

751
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:11,642
We didn't have enough money to visit anywhere else. It was still fun.

752
00:29:11,642 --> 00:29:12,910
(It's an unforgettable taste.)

753
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:15,379
- I ran into Jae Seok here a lot. - That's right.

754
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:17,281
Are you guys going to eat fried rice?

755
00:29:17,281 --> 00:29:20,551
- The sauce tastes incredible. - I agree.

756
00:29:21,151 --> 00:29:22,786
- I love this. - It tastes amazing.

757
00:29:22,786 --> 00:29:25,489
(The sauce tastes spicy at first, but it leaves behind a sweet taste.)

758
00:29:25,489 --> 00:29:27,992
It tastes different from the usual stir-fried squid.

759
00:29:28,292 --> 00:29:30,361
Look. That one's a killer. It's deep-fried squid.

760
00:29:32,596 --> 00:29:34,031
(Here's a dish that will calm down the spiciness.)

761
00:29:34,031 --> 00:29:36,233
I used to eat this a lot too.

762
00:29:37,935 --> 00:29:39,904
My gosh, this deep-fried squid tastes incredible.

763
00:29:39,904 --> 00:29:42,172
(Deep-fried squid is another signature menu of this restaurant.)

764
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,375
I really love this.

765
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:46,543
(The savory deep-fried squid makes you crave spiciness again.)

766
00:29:47,478 --> 00:29:50,481
But is it really okay for us to eat so carelessly like this?

767
00:29:50,481 --> 00:29:53,050
- Of course. - I'm not trying to be suspicious.

768
00:29:54,151 --> 00:29:56,420
(They finally finish their meal.)

769
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,589
- Did you enjoy your meal? - Yes.

770
00:29:58,589 --> 00:29:59,790
It was amazing.

771
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:02,326
Then let's start the mission right away.

772
00:30:04,295 --> 00:30:06,563
(We got fooled. There was no way they'd let us eat this for nothing.)

773
00:30:07,197 --> 00:30:10,034
The name of this mission is called, "Consume Your Calories".

774
00:30:10,234 --> 00:30:12,002
- We ate a lot. - "Consume Your Calories".

775
00:30:12,303 --> 00:30:15,372
You can exit this place only after you finish...

776
00:30:15,372 --> 00:30:18,375
burning up all the calories you've absorbed.

777
00:30:18,375 --> 00:30:21,011
(Stir-fried small octopus: 366kcal, Deep-fried squid: 378kcal,)

778
00:30:21,011 --> 00:30:22,947
(Side dishes: 100kcal, Total: 844kcal)

779
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,950
- Okay. - Is that even possible?

780
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,184
(I'm doomed.)

781
00:30:27,184 --> 00:30:30,754
Three people will have to turn on their phones...

782
00:30:30,754 --> 00:30:33,757
by using a manual phone charger.

783
00:30:33,757 --> 00:30:39,196
Then you need to take a selfie with your team members and send it to me.

784
00:30:39,396 --> 00:30:40,698
- Get ready. - Okay.

785
00:30:40,698 --> 00:30:42,399
(Start consuming your calories.)

786
00:30:43,233 --> 00:30:44,902
Ji Hyo, mine will turn on quickly.

787
00:30:44,902 --> 00:30:46,837
(Everyone is busy turning the handle.)

788
00:30:47,905 --> 00:30:49,873
(Powerful)

789
00:30:49,873 --> 00:30:52,710
I'm scared that this will fall off if I turn it too aggressively.

790
00:30:52,743 --> 00:30:55,279
(Their hands are almost invisible.)

791
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,848
Is this charging? Can you check if this is working?

792
00:30:57,848 --> 00:30:59,316
- Mine turned on. - It's working.

793
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:00,684
(Excited)

794
00:31:00,684 --> 00:31:03,520
- Hurry. - Calm down and keep going.

795
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:05,055
- It's working. - It turned on.

796
00:31:05,055 --> 00:31:06,490
(Ji Hyo is in charge of calming the whiners.)

797
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,993
- Ji Hyo, this is killing me. - Keep going.

798
00:31:08,993 --> 00:31:11,161
- We only need to turn on one phone. - My gosh, this is so hard.

799
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:13,097
- My gosh. - We need to take a selfie.

800
00:31:13,097 --> 00:31:15,032
(I can feel...)

801
00:31:16,033 --> 00:31:19,403
(my second ego entering my body.)

802
00:31:19,403 --> 00:31:23,907
(Phone, can you hear me?)

803
00:31:25,242 --> 00:31:28,379
(Just like how Toruk Makto communicates,)

804
00:31:28,379 --> 00:31:33,751
(please hurry up and brighten your screens!)

805
00:31:35,786 --> 00:31:42,159
(Will Kwang Soo be able to awaken the sleeping phones?)

806
00:31:43,594 --> 00:31:46,296
- Keep going. - It's on!

807
00:31:46,296 --> 00:31:47,398
(The phone is on.)

808
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:49,033
- Hurry. - In 1, 2, 3.

809
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:56,273
(They need to take a photo and send it to complete their mission.)

810
00:31:57,141 --> 00:31:58,942
(Jong Kook's team succeeds with the first phone.)

811
00:31:58,942 --> 00:32:01,545
- I got one from Jong Kook's team. - I sent it.

812
00:32:01,979 --> 00:32:04,048
- Let's do this. - Keep going.

813
00:32:04,048 --> 00:32:05,783
Hey, look at the camera while you're at it.

814
00:32:05,849 --> 00:32:09,386
- We're almost done. - Everyone, let's take a picture.

815
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:12,022
(They don't have enough battery.)

816
00:32:12,022 --> 00:32:14,792
- It's on. - My gosh, we need more battery.

817
00:32:14,792 --> 00:32:16,660
(They fail to take a picture.)

818
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,695
- Hurry up. - Give it a try.

819
00:32:18,695 --> 00:32:20,330
- Come on. - Do it with mine.

820
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,432
- No. - Try it now.

821
00:32:21,432 --> 00:32:23,133
(Ji Hyo is suffering because of the whiners.)

822
00:32:23,801 --> 00:32:25,736
(Let's try it with another phone.)

823
00:32:25,836 --> 00:32:27,037
Hurry. Come here.

824
00:32:27,037 --> 00:32:28,806
- Why is it only one percent? - What?

825
00:32:29,139 --> 00:32:31,575
- Hurry up! - We can still take a photo.

826
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:33,110
(The other phones only have 1 percent battery life.)

827
00:32:34,178 --> 00:32:35,179
(They seem exhausted.)

828
00:32:35,179 --> 00:32:37,781
- Shouldn't it have more battery? - It's weird.

829
00:32:37,781 --> 00:32:40,384
(Is it my turn to show my power?)

830
00:32:41,652 --> 00:32:45,389
(Endless power)

831
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:50,961
(He's like a human motor.)

832
00:32:52,196 --> 00:32:54,131
(It finally turns on.)

833
00:32:54,998 --> 00:32:57,701
(They even succeed in turning on the camera.)

834
00:32:57,701 --> 00:32:59,837
- It worked! Hurry! - Haha, look here!

835
00:32:59,837 --> 00:33:01,805
In 1, 2, 3.

836
00:33:02,773 --> 00:33:06,110
(Jong Kook's team succeeds again with their second phone.)

837
00:33:06,944 --> 00:33:08,278
(The current score is 2 to 0.)

838
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:10,180
- Hurry. - We don't have enough battery.

839
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,548
Come on. Turn it faster.

840
00:33:11,548 --> 00:33:13,684
(Did you not see what that team has already achieved?)

841
00:33:13,684 --> 00:33:17,054
- Keep going, you guys. - Ji Hyo, this is really killing me.

842
00:33:17,054 --> 00:33:18,088
Wait.

843
00:33:18,088 --> 00:33:19,690
(He's too exhausted to even sit down properly.)

844
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:21,325
- This is so hard. - Just a second.

845
00:33:21,325 --> 00:33:22,693
(This team is a group of weaklings.)

846
00:33:23,427 --> 00:33:24,695
(It's on!)

847
00:33:24,695 --> 00:33:27,531
My phone turned on. Hurry up. Min Yong, come here.

848
00:33:27,531 --> 00:33:28,999
(For the first time, they finally turn on the camera.)

849
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:32,636
- Jae Seok's team sent me one too. - Nice work.

850
00:33:33,937 --> 00:33:35,072
(The current score is 2 to 1.)

851
00:33:35,072 --> 00:33:36,473
- Let's go. - Hurry up.

852
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:37,975
(Jong Kook's team only has 1 more phone to turn on.)

853
00:33:37,975 --> 00:33:41,078
- Look here. In 1, 2, 3. - Hurry up.

854
00:33:41,078 --> 00:33:42,546
(They pose for victory.)

855
00:33:42,546 --> 00:33:44,915
- We need more battery. - Let's try again.

856
00:33:45,048 --> 00:33:46,216
(This gives Jae Seok's team a golden opportunity.)

857
00:33:46,216 --> 00:33:48,952
- We need more battery. - You guys are really close.

858
00:33:48,952 --> 00:33:50,487
- Hurry up! - I can't do this.

859
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:52,389
(Use the energy you used to eat the stir-fried small octopus.)

860
00:33:52,689 --> 00:33:54,892
- Take a photo with mine. - No, wait.

861
00:33:54,892 --> 00:33:57,127
- Try it with mine. - Hurry up.

862
00:33:57,127 --> 00:33:58,162
Okay.

863
00:33:58,162 --> 00:33:59,663
(She turns on Seok Jin's camera.)

864
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,032
(They take a photo.)

865
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:05,135
- We did it. - Hurry up and send it.

866
00:34:05,135 --> 00:34:08,772
(They successfully send their second photo.)

867
00:34:09,273 --> 00:34:11,475
(The current score is 2 to 2.)

868
00:34:11,475 --> 00:34:13,744
- This is driving me crazy. - This is so hard.

869
00:34:13,744 --> 00:34:15,045
(They need to hurry up to beat the other team.)

870
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,482
(They're already done consuming their calories.)

871
00:34:18,482 --> 00:34:20,951
- Hurry up! - My arm hurts!

872
00:34:22,553 --> 00:34:25,055
- Hey, let's just try this. - Screen capture?

873
00:34:25,055 --> 00:34:26,089
(Whispering)

874
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,025
- Be quiet. - Try it.

875
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:30,127
- Let's send this. - Hurry up.

876
00:34:30,127 --> 00:34:32,329
(Can they successfully take a screen shot?)

877
00:34:32,663 --> 00:34:34,531
- In 1, 2, 3. - How are they taking a picture?

878
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:37,034
(What are they doing?)

879
00:34:38,035 --> 00:34:41,638
(You won't know even if you see it.)

880
00:34:43,574 --> 00:34:45,275
How do you take a screen shot?

881
00:34:45,275 --> 00:34:46,276
(What is Bo Mi trying to screen shot?)

882
00:34:46,276 --> 00:34:48,478
You just need to press that button.

883
00:34:48,478 --> 00:34:50,948
(They're trying to take a screen shot of a video call screen.)

884
00:34:51,915 --> 00:34:53,217
(You can take a video call even with just one percent battery life.)

885
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:54,952
Send it. We did it, right?

886
00:34:55,752 --> 00:34:56,753
Let's try...

887
00:34:56,753 --> 00:34:59,756
(Jong Kook's team wins.)

888
00:35:01,525 --> 00:35:04,228
- Bo Mi's so smart. - I'm so happy.

889
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:07,631
- My goodness. - How did you think of that?

890
00:35:07,631 --> 00:35:09,633
Did they send a photo from another phone?

891
00:35:09,633 --> 00:35:12,002
- No, that's not it. - Is it a different number?

892
00:35:12,002 --> 00:35:15,939
Jong Kook's team screen captured a video call screen and sent it.

893
00:35:15,939 --> 00:35:16,940
(Ta-da)

894
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:19,109
The video call worked. We captured that.

895
00:35:20,177 --> 00:35:22,212
- She's so smart. - Bo Mi.

896
00:35:22,212 --> 00:35:24,681
- How incredible. - You're so smart, Bo Mi.

897
00:35:24,681 --> 00:35:27,584
Here's something for Jong Kook's team who won.

898
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:28,986
(Jong Kook's team gets 1 item.)

899
00:35:28,986 --> 00:35:31,788
- This is your second hint. - This is a small octopus.

900
00:35:31,788 --> 00:35:34,891
- The second hint is... - Seafood!

901
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:36,593
It's alive.

902
00:35:36,994 --> 00:35:38,895
(Rice, barley, and seafood are three very different items.)

903
00:35:38,895 --> 00:35:41,231
- We ate small octopus. - It's alive.

904
00:35:41,898 --> 00:35:43,333
The next place is...

905
00:35:43,634 --> 00:35:45,936
recommended by Jong Kook. It's a restaurant that sells eel.

906
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:48,171
- I love eel. - Let's go.

907
00:35:49,072 --> 00:35:50,073
("Running Man's Food Guide")

908
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,777
(Braised spicy chicken, eel, small octopus, bulgogi)

909
00:35:55,012 --> 00:35:59,583
(Jong Kook's favorite restaurant is located in Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul.)

910
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,786
(It's a restaurant where you can taste fiery eel.)

911
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:04,021
I'm looking forward to this dish.

912
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:05,956
It's different.

913
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:07,624
- Is it good? - Yes.

914
00:36:08,158 --> 00:36:11,695
(They serve spicy grilled eel and salted grilled eel.)

915
00:36:11,695 --> 00:36:14,131
We will be going to the restaurant recommended by Jong Kook.

916
00:36:14,197 --> 00:36:15,832
The restaurant that sells grilled eel.

917
00:36:16,767 --> 00:36:19,603
The team that gets to the place through public transportation...

918
00:36:19,603 --> 00:36:21,972
- first will be the winner. - Really?

919
00:36:21,972 --> 00:36:25,475
You just need to get there first. You can use the bus or the subway.

920
00:36:26,376 --> 00:36:28,378
- First you need to... - I guess we need to choose.

921
00:36:28,378 --> 00:36:30,414
- My goodness. - Why are you guys picking first?

922
00:36:30,414 --> 00:36:33,016
- But at this hour, the subway... - Let's choose.

923
00:36:33,016 --> 00:36:35,152
(They can only use the transportation they've picked.)

924
00:36:35,152 --> 00:36:38,588
- Yes, we got the subway. - The subway's way better.

925
00:36:38,588 --> 00:36:40,691
- We can let them win at least once. - Sure.

926
00:36:40,691 --> 00:36:42,659
Taking the bus doesn't mean that we'll lose either.

927
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:46,063
- You can go now. - Let's have a fair start.

928
00:36:46,063 --> 00:36:48,598
- The subway is better right now. - The subway is faster.

929
00:36:48,765 --> 00:36:50,200
- See you later. - Bye.

930
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,768
(They all head to the place recommended by Jong Kook.)

931
00:36:52,602 --> 00:36:54,638
- It's here. - We just need to transfer once.

932
00:36:54,638 --> 00:36:55,939
(They need to check the route first.)

933
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:59,910
Taking a bus is really comfortable.

934
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:02,946
We need to find a bus that goes to Yeouido.

935
00:37:02,946 --> 00:37:05,048
(Let's take a bus that goes to Yeouido when we're not sure.)

936
00:37:06,416 --> 00:37:09,319
- I found it. Bus number 362. - Let's take that bus.

937
00:37:09,786 --> 00:37:11,121
Where do we get off?

938
00:37:11,121 --> 00:37:13,990
We need to get off at Yeouido and head to Yeongdeungpo from there.

939
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,959
- Really? - I know you.

940
00:37:15,959 --> 00:37:17,928
- Hello. - Hello.

941
00:37:18,061 --> 00:37:20,797
- I watch your show a lot. - Thank you.

942
00:37:20,797 --> 00:37:23,934
- You even had a cute second child. - Yes, thank you.

943
00:37:23,934 --> 00:37:26,036
(He's embarrassed and grateful.)

944
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:27,404
- Thank you. - Thank you.

945
00:37:27,404 --> 00:37:29,773
- The bus is here! - Bus number 362!

946
00:37:29,773 --> 00:37:31,942
- Get on. - It goes to Yeouido, right?

947
00:37:31,942 --> 00:37:34,678
- We need to get to Yeouido first. - Four people?

948
00:37:34,978 --> 00:37:38,682
- We have four people. - Yes.

949
00:37:38,682 --> 00:37:40,016
Thank you.

950
00:37:40,016 --> 00:37:42,285
(We'll soon be there to greet you guys.)

951
00:37:42,285 --> 00:37:43,754
Go to the back.

952
00:37:45,922 --> 00:37:47,758
(The bus departs.)

953
00:37:49,493 --> 00:37:51,895
(Let's be quiet and not cause trouble to others.)

954
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:54,631
- How many stations should we go? - Just a few stops.

955
00:37:54,631 --> 00:37:57,134
I'm going to give you guys a mission right now.

956
00:37:57,134 --> 00:37:58,935
- In here? - Yes.

957
00:37:58,935 --> 00:38:00,604
(The mission is rock-paper-scissors.)

958
00:38:00,604 --> 00:38:03,006
(After throwing a dice, they need to win the equivalent amount of...)

959
00:38:03,006 --> 00:38:05,409
(games of rock-paper-scissors in a row.)

960
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:07,978
(If they win, they'll be given a chance to choose a chance card.)

961
00:38:08,378 --> 00:38:10,480
- There are some chance cards. - Okay.

962
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,616
Among the cards, there's a card where you can take the taxi.

963
00:38:12,616 --> 00:38:15,819
(There's a taxi card which will allow them to get there faster.)

964
00:38:16,052 --> 00:38:18,622
- And? - The others are...

965
00:38:18,622 --> 00:38:22,159
two Push-Out Cards and a dud.

966
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:23,493
(Two Push-Out Cards and a dud)

967
00:38:23,693 --> 00:38:27,297
If you pick a Push-Out Card, the other team has to get off.

968
00:38:27,397 --> 00:38:29,800
Does that mean we might have to get off the bus too?

969
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,901
(It's important to avoid the dud.)

970
00:38:31,501 --> 00:38:32,602
Let's hurry.

971
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:34,104
(The subway team starts from Apgujeong Station.)

972
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:35,605
- We're finally running. - Ji Hyo.

973
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,607
Hurry. We don't have much time.

974
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:39,309
We should go that way.

975
00:38:39,309 --> 00:38:41,978
- We have to go to Chungmuro. - It's this way.

976
00:38:42,345 --> 00:38:43,713
It'll open.

977
00:38:43,713 --> 00:38:45,482
(They'll transfer at Jongno 3-ga.)

978
00:38:45,482 --> 00:38:46,917
I haven't been on the subway in a long time.

979
00:38:46,917 --> 00:38:48,885
- It's coming. - It's coming.

980
00:38:49,085 --> 00:38:50,921
- Do you know where we're going? - Of course.

981
00:38:51,922 --> 00:38:53,490
- Let's get on. - Let's get on.

982
00:38:54,191 --> 00:38:56,293
- How many stops? - Please excuse us.

983
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,628
- It's five stops. - There are many senior citizens.

984
00:38:59,095 --> 00:39:00,730
- Let's keep our voices down. - Hello.

985
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:02,032
(The subway team heads for their third spot.)

986
00:39:02,032 --> 00:39:03,700
Are we going to do it here?

987
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,002
Let's do it here.

988
00:39:07,504 --> 00:39:08,672
- Ji Hyo. - Who should do it?

989
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:14,711
(We lost twice in a row. We have only one to rely on.)

990
00:39:14,711 --> 00:39:15,979
Min Yong, do you want to try?

991
00:39:16,213 --> 00:39:17,647
We need one.

992
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:19,583
- Do we need 1? - Yes, avoid 6.

993
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:21,284
- This is my first time. - Say, "challenge".

994
00:39:21,284 --> 00:39:22,352
Challenge.

995
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:24,454
I'll start.

996
00:39:25,789 --> 00:39:26,890
One!

997
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:27,991
(He throws the die nonchalantly.)

998
00:39:28,492 --> 00:39:29,593
One.

999
00:39:29,793 --> 00:39:30,994
One.

1000
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:32,929
(Is Min Yong lucky or unlucky?)

1001
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:34,898
One.

1002
00:39:34,931 --> 00:39:36,032
It's a two.

1003
00:39:36,032 --> 00:39:37,701
(They get 2.)

1004
00:39:37,701 --> 00:39:39,302
(See?)

1005
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:42,706
- Good. That was amazing. - We got two.

1006
00:39:42,706 --> 00:39:43,773
You're very good.

1007
00:39:43,773 --> 00:39:45,242
I ranked number two in the forgotten celebrity survey.

1008
00:39:46,309 --> 00:39:48,478
- Who was number one? - Goo Bon Seung.

1009
00:39:48,478 --> 00:39:50,413
(Goo Bon Seung was number one.)

1010
00:39:50,413 --> 00:39:51,982
- We need to win just twice. - He did a great job.

1011
00:39:51,982 --> 00:39:54,150
If you win twice in a row, you'll get to pick a card.

1012
00:39:54,284 --> 00:39:56,286
- I'll try it as I threw the die. - You try.

1013
00:39:56,286 --> 00:39:57,354
You should.

1014
00:39:57,354 --> 00:39:58,989
Can you play rock-paper-scissors with him?

1015
00:39:59,055 --> 00:40:00,257
What are you going to show?

1016
00:40:00,257 --> 00:40:01,992
(The woman happily accepts the challenge.)

1017
00:40:01,992 --> 00:40:04,861
- Please. - I'm a man.

1018
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:09,332
(I'm a man, and you know what that means.)

1019
00:40:09,332 --> 00:40:10,433
Rock-paper-scissors.

1020
00:40:10,433 --> 00:40:13,303
(Then I'll give you paper.)

1021
00:40:13,637 --> 00:40:15,272
(Min Yong fails right away.)

1022
00:40:15,272 --> 00:40:17,173
She wants to win of course.

1023
00:40:17,173 --> 00:40:18,375
(He underestimated her.)

1024
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:19,509
We should try once again.

1025
00:40:19,509 --> 00:40:21,611
- It'll be all right. - Throw the die first.

1026
00:40:21,978 --> 00:40:23,914
- I'll throw the die. - We need a one.

1027
00:40:25,315 --> 00:40:27,784
(Will a miracle happen?)

1028
00:40:28,785 --> 00:40:30,253
- It's a 2. - It's a 2.

1029
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,721
Go over there.

1030
00:40:31,788 --> 00:40:34,491
Could you play rock-paper-scissors with me?

1031
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:36,192
(The man is puzzled.)

1032
00:40:36,192 --> 00:40:39,296
Rock-paper-scissors. Rock-paper-scissors.

1033
00:40:39,763 --> 00:40:41,264
(Seok Jin wins.)

1034
00:40:41,331 --> 00:40:42,499
He won.

1035
00:40:42,532 --> 00:40:43,633
Thank you.

1036
00:40:43,633 --> 00:40:44,768
(Seok Jin is sneaky.)

1037
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:46,036
Can we play rock-paper-scissors?

1038
00:40:46,202 --> 00:40:48,772
(He needs to win just one more time.)

1039
00:40:48,772 --> 00:40:49,873
Rock-paper-scissors.

1040
00:40:51,007 --> 00:40:53,543
(Will they get to take a taxi to Yeongdeungpo?)

1041
00:40:53,643 --> 00:40:56,580
(Will they get to push the other team out of the bus?)

1042
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,449
(Will Seok Jin unexpectedly bring victory to his team?)

1043
00:41:01,217 --> 00:41:02,385
(Seok Jin wins.)

1044
00:41:02,385 --> 00:41:05,388
Nice! You did it!

1045
00:41:05,488 --> 00:41:06,523
(Be quiet.)

1046
00:41:06,523 --> 00:41:09,259
(They're celebrating silently.)

1047
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:10,894
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1048
00:41:11,194 --> 00:41:14,631
(The angels gave Seok Jin hope.)

1049
00:41:14,631 --> 00:41:16,132
- I can't believe this. - It's unbelievable.

1050
00:41:16,333 --> 00:41:18,101
That was amazing.

1051
00:41:18,835 --> 00:41:20,003
- That really was. - Everyone.

1052
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:24,040
As you completed the mission, you get to pick a card.

1053
00:41:24,641 --> 00:41:25,909
Min Yong, go ahead.

1054
00:41:26,176 --> 00:41:27,243
(Min Yong does not hesitate.)

1055
00:41:27,243 --> 00:41:29,746
Min Yong, do a good job. We want a taxi.

1056
00:41:29,879 --> 00:41:33,249
(This is his chance to make up for his failure.)

1057
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:35,418
We want a taxi.

1058
00:41:35,418 --> 00:41:36,753
(He picks a card without hesitation.)

1059
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:37,921
It's okay as long as it's not a dud.

1060
00:41:40,056 --> 00:41:42,792
(There's a 25-percent chance it'll be the taxi.)

1061
00:41:42,926 --> 00:41:46,296
(Will Min Yong prove himself?)

1062
00:41:46,763 --> 00:41:47,931
(Sighing)

1063
00:41:47,931 --> 00:41:49,933
(Dud)

1064
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,835
You're unbelievable.

1065
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:53,403
You're so unlucky.

1066
00:41:53,403 --> 00:41:55,205
(He's as unlucky as Kwang Soo.)

1067
00:41:55,205 --> 00:41:56,306
My goodness.

1068
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,242
(Min Yong reminds them of Kwang Soo.)

1069
00:41:59,242 --> 00:42:01,711
My goodness. I can't believe this.

1070
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:07,050
(In our team, you can play the role of Kwang Soo.)

1071
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:12,122
(He followed Jae Seok's order too precisely.)

1072
00:42:12,122 --> 00:42:13,289
(Is someone talking about me?)

1073
00:42:13,289 --> 00:42:17,727
You have to win as many times in a row as the number you get.

1074
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,862
Okay.

1075
00:42:19,062 --> 00:42:20,497
One, two, three.

1076
00:42:20,497 --> 00:42:22,932
(Bo Mi throws the die on behalf of the other members.)

1077
00:42:24,134 --> 00:42:25,835
(It's a 2.)

1078
00:42:26,302 --> 00:42:29,039
(Good job, Bo Mi.)

1079
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:30,774
Could you play rock-paper-scissors with me?

1080
00:42:30,774 --> 00:42:32,242
Rock-paper-scissors.

1081
00:42:32,242 --> 00:42:35,245
(Will Kwang Soo be unlucky today too?)

1082
00:42:35,245 --> 00:42:36,379
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1083
00:42:37,113 --> 00:42:39,716
(Unexpectedly, Kwang Soo wins.)

1084
00:42:39,716 --> 00:42:40,817
Did you win?

1085
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:42,085
Miss.

1086
00:42:43,086 --> 00:42:44,721
- Thank you. - Excuse me.

1087
00:42:44,788 --> 00:42:46,322
We need to win one more time.

1088
00:42:46,322 --> 00:42:48,191
(They spot two beautiful girls.)

1089
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,793
Beautiful ladies.

1090
00:42:50,994 --> 00:42:52,295
Beautiful ladies.

1091
00:42:52,295 --> 00:42:53,396
- Hello. - Kwang Soo usually...

1092
00:42:53,396 --> 00:42:55,198
wins against beautiful girls.

1093
00:42:55,632 --> 00:42:56,833
- Kwang Soo. - Hello.

1094
00:42:57,133 --> 00:42:59,436
Could you play rock-paper-scissors with me?

1095
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:03,273
Hello. Could you play rock-paper scissors with me?

1096
00:43:03,606 --> 00:43:04,674
Thank you.

1097
00:43:05,075 --> 00:43:06,142
Here we go.

1098
00:43:06,409 --> 00:43:07,744
Rock-paper-scissors.

1099
00:43:08,611 --> 00:43:11,281
(Kwang Soo usually wins against beautiful girls.)

1100
00:43:11,281 --> 00:43:13,850
(Will he win this time too?)

1101
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:15,051
Rock-paper-scissors.

1102
00:43:15,752 --> 00:43:17,887
(Kwang Soo wins.)

1103
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,622
(The bus team completes the mission.)

1104
00:43:19,622 --> 00:43:20,757
He won.

1105
00:43:21,591 --> 00:43:23,593
Thank you.

1106
00:43:24,694 --> 00:43:26,196
Thank you.

1107
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:27,564
Kwang Soo is strong against beautiful girls.

1108
00:43:29,132 --> 00:43:31,534
(They celebrate silently.)

1109
00:43:32,535 --> 00:43:34,337
(They have to pick 1 card out of the 4.)

1110
00:43:34,337 --> 00:43:36,606
Each of you take one, and I'll take the one left.

1111
00:43:36,606 --> 00:43:38,575
That sounds good. Kwang Soo, you're unlucky. You go first.

1112
00:43:38,775 --> 00:43:39,909
Take one away.

1113
00:43:40,176 --> 00:43:41,277
I'll take one too.

1114
00:43:42,212 --> 00:43:45,248
(There's only one left.)

1115
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:47,016
This one is your choice.

1116
00:43:47,016 --> 00:43:48,017
(This card is their choice.)

1117
00:43:48,051 --> 00:43:49,352
Open your cards one by one.

1118
00:43:49,352 --> 00:43:51,020
(Kwang Soo opens his card.)

1119
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:53,022
(Kwang Soo chose the Taxi Card.)

1120
00:43:53,022 --> 00:43:54,758
Gosh, he's so unlucky.

1121
00:43:55,191 --> 00:43:56,793
I think you have a dud.

1122
00:43:56,793 --> 00:43:58,561
I think it's a dud.

1123
00:43:58,962 --> 00:44:01,698
(If one of them has a dud, it means Bo Mi has the Push-Out Card.)

1124
00:44:02,232 --> 00:44:04,200
(It's a dud.)

1125
00:44:05,635 --> 00:44:08,037
(Excited)

1126
00:44:08,238 --> 00:44:10,273
(It means...)

1127
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:14,277
(Bo Mi picked the Push-Out Card.)

1128
00:44:16,913 --> 00:44:18,782
The Taxi Card would've been great.

1129
00:44:18,782 --> 00:44:20,350
(The other team will be forced off the subway.)

1130
00:44:21,151 --> 00:44:24,387
The other team just completed the mission.

1131
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:26,456
You will be forced out of the subway.

1132
00:44:28,658 --> 00:44:30,794
- What happens now? - You'll get off at the next stop.

1133
00:44:30,794 --> 00:44:33,897
Wait for the next train there.

1134
00:44:33,897 --> 00:44:34,931
(They'll have to wait for the next train at Euljiro 3-ga.)

1135
00:44:35,832 --> 00:44:38,301
Min Yong, you're so unlucky.

1136
00:44:39,402 --> 00:44:40,837
You're so unlucky.

1137
00:44:41,471 --> 00:44:44,107
I wish we could go just one more stop.

1138
00:44:44,874 --> 00:44:46,409
(It's one stop before the transfer station.)

1139
00:44:46,409 --> 00:44:48,178
Thank you.

1140
00:44:48,178 --> 00:44:49,546
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1141
00:44:49,813 --> 00:44:53,016
Is it one stop before the transfer station?

1142
00:44:53,016 --> 00:44:54,784
Nothing is going our way.

1143
00:44:54,784 --> 00:44:56,452
(What is wrong with us?)

1144
00:44:56,452 --> 00:45:00,423
Usually, Ji Hyo's team is good at these kinds of games,

1145
00:45:00,423 --> 00:45:01,658
but we're so unlucky.

1146
00:45:02,425 --> 00:45:04,994
The next train won't be here soon.

1147
00:45:05,295 --> 00:45:08,431
The train is approaching Chungmuro Station.

1148
00:45:08,531 --> 00:45:10,033
We're so...

1149
00:45:10,099 --> 00:45:12,135
We've been waiting for about 10 minutes now.

1150
00:45:12,135 --> 00:45:13,603
I mean...

1151
00:45:14,704 --> 00:45:16,506
How is this humanely possible?

1152
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,309
So many things went wrong.

1153
00:45:19,309 --> 00:45:21,211
We're so unlucky today.

1154
00:45:21,211 --> 00:45:23,046
- We're not a good team. - We aren't.

1155
00:45:23,146 --> 00:45:25,748
I wish I could team up with Ji Hyo and Bo Mi.

1156
00:45:26,583 --> 00:45:30,753
It's your fault that we were forced off the train.

1157
00:45:30,787 --> 00:45:32,622
I wish I could team up with Ji Hyo and Bo Mi too.

1158
00:45:32,622 --> 00:45:33,756
Same here.

1159
00:45:34,757 --> 00:45:35,892
We all feel the same.

1160
00:45:35,892 --> 00:45:39,262
(What is Bo Mi, the girl everyone wants, doing?)

1161
00:45:39,262 --> 00:45:40,396
We're so lucky.

1162
00:45:40,396 --> 00:45:41,731
(They're relaxed.)

1163
00:45:41,731 --> 00:45:42,799
Be quiet.

1164
00:45:44,534 --> 00:45:45,535
(Blowing)

1165
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:48,638
Your hair is flying in the wind. You're looking great.

1166
00:45:50,006 --> 00:45:51,541
That looks cool.

1167
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:54,010
(The wind blows in my heart too.)

1168
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:55,478
(Uncomfortable)

1169
00:45:56,446 --> 00:45:57,547
Bo Mi, what do you think of guys like him?

1170
00:45:57,547 --> 00:45:59,415
- He's handsome. - Do you think so?

1171
00:45:59,415 --> 00:46:01,384
(Thank you, cute lady.)

1172
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:03,086
I hope those two end up together.

1173
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:05,188
Then we could hang out all together.

1174
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:12,629
Let's play a game, Team White versus Team Black.

1175
00:46:12,629 --> 00:46:15,431
(Bo Mi, give me five.)

1176
00:46:16,633 --> 00:46:18,635
It's a game where you hold each other's hand.

1177
00:46:18,635 --> 00:46:20,303
Right. It's a couple game.

1178
00:46:21,471 --> 00:46:23,573
(Will you give it a try?)

1179
00:46:23,573 --> 00:46:24,774
It's a couple game.

1180
00:46:24,774 --> 00:46:26,142
(We should follow the rules.)

1181
00:46:26,976 --> 00:46:29,412
(Bo Mi...)

1182
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:30,546
Hold each other's hand.

1183
00:46:30,546 --> 00:46:32,015
(We need to follow the rules.)

1184
00:46:33,016 --> 00:46:35,685
(Kwang Soo is happy.)

1185
00:46:35,685 --> 00:46:37,387
(It's so funny.)

1186
00:46:37,787 --> 00:46:39,122
(Kwang Soo gazes at his hand.)

1187
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:45,895
(I think spring is here.)

1188
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:49,499
(What is with him?)

1189
00:46:49,832 --> 00:46:52,135
(I won't wash my hands.)

1190
00:46:52,201 --> 00:46:55,672
This time, our faces should touch.

1191
00:46:55,672 --> 00:46:56,906
(Their faces should touch.)

1192
00:46:57,807 --> 00:46:59,208
We shouldn't lose.

1193
00:47:01,577 --> 00:47:03,613
(These guys are hilarious.)

1194
00:47:04,314 --> 00:47:05,481
(Come on.)

1195
00:47:06,082 --> 00:47:07,317
(Ready)

1196
00:47:08,584 --> 00:47:15,658
(Bo Mi, this is just a game. We need to do our best.)

1197
00:47:15,658 --> 00:47:17,527
(Slapping)

1198
00:47:17,527 --> 00:47:19,762
(Wake up.)

1199
00:47:20,296 --> 00:47:21,631
(What did I do wrong?)

1200
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:22,732
What?

1201
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,735
What did I do wrong?

1202
00:47:25,835 --> 00:47:28,371
You guys look so cute together.

1203
00:47:28,371 --> 00:47:30,473
(Kwang Soo and Bo Mi look cute together.)

1204
00:47:30,473 --> 00:47:31,941
(Kwang Soo feels shy.)

1205
00:47:32,241 --> 00:47:33,376
(National Assembly Station)

1206
00:47:33,376 --> 00:47:36,779
(They need to transfer here.)

1207
00:47:39,983 --> 00:47:41,050
Let's do this.

1208
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:42,418
Bye. Thank you.

1209
00:47:42,418 --> 00:47:43,486
(They thank the passengers.)

1210
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:46,189
(They need to transfer to a bus for Yeongdeungpo.)

1211
00:47:46,189 --> 00:47:48,024
- It's here! - That's our bus!

1212
00:47:48,024 --> 00:47:49,425
- Really? - Let's get on!

1213
00:47:49,425 --> 00:47:50,960
- Is this our bus? - We're so lucky.

1214
00:47:51,394 --> 00:47:52,428
My goodness.

1215
00:47:52,428 --> 00:47:54,130
(They're so lucky.)
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

1216
00:47:55,264 --> 00:47:57,567
- Hello. - Hello.

1217
00:47:57,567 --> 00:47:59,936
(How can they be this lucky?)

1218
00:48:00,837 --> 00:48:03,673
(The bus team already transferred.)

1219
00:48:04,073 --> 00:48:05,008
(The subway team is about to transfer.)

1220
00:48:05,008 --> 00:48:07,143
- Are we taking Line Five? - Yes.

1221
00:48:09,479 --> 00:48:11,214
I haven't transferred at Jongno 3-ga Station in forever.

1222
00:48:12,482 --> 00:48:14,417
The platform is very far.

1223
00:48:15,952 --> 00:48:17,320
Jae Seok, we have to hurry.

1224
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,588
Right. I know.

1225
00:48:18,755 --> 00:48:19,789
Is this it?

1226
00:48:19,789 --> 00:48:20,990
(They can't give up now.)

1227
00:48:21,157 --> 00:48:22,759
We have to go to Yeongdeungpo Market Station.

1228
00:48:22,792 --> 00:48:23,993
- We have to get on this. - Yeongdeungpo Market Station?

1229
00:48:24,027 --> 00:48:25,628
We have to start now.

1230
00:48:25,995 --> 00:48:27,130
Let's go.

1231
00:48:27,597 --> 00:48:30,400
(In order to rescue his team as the team captain,)

1232
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,503
(he takes the initiative and leads as an example.)

1233
00:48:33,503 --> 00:48:35,838
(Will this throw save his team from this critical situation?)

1234
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:37,306
I can't believe this.

1235
00:48:37,306 --> 00:48:39,308
(He throws the highest number as the team captain.)

1236
00:48:39,308 --> 00:48:40,777
You are truly unlucky.

1237
00:48:40,777 --> 00:48:43,379
- You have to get smacked by us. - Hold on.

1238
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:45,548
(His unluckiness is beyond their expectations.)

1239
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:48,217
- How can you get six? - Let me try.

1240
00:48:48,217 --> 00:48:50,920
Who knows? If you succeed, it's a miracle.

1241
00:48:51,054 --> 00:48:52,922
- It's not easy though. - He's really unlucky.

1242
00:48:52,922 --> 00:48:55,291
Excuse me, I have to play rock-paper-scissors with six people.

1243
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:56,859
How could he get six?

1244
00:48:56,859 --> 00:48:57,927
(He's one of a kind.)

1245
00:48:58,528 --> 00:49:00,763
Can you play rock-paper-scissors with me? Rock-paper-scissors.

1246
00:49:00,963 --> 00:49:03,066
(Jae Seok, cheer up with this 1st win.)

1247
00:49:03,332 --> 00:49:04,534
She let him win.

1248
00:49:04,967 --> 00:49:07,003
(He happily wins 2 times in a row.)

1249
00:49:07,003 --> 00:49:08,604
(He has to win 4 more times.)

1250
00:49:08,604 --> 00:49:11,174
(Somehow, he manages to win 3 times in a row.)

1251
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:14,710
(They allow themselves to get their hopes up.)

1252
00:49:15,478 --> 00:49:17,680
Can you play rock-paper-scissors with me? Rock-paper-scissors.

1253
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,416
(He miraculously wins 4 times in a row!)

1254
00:49:21,117 --> 00:49:22,251
Jae Seok.

1255
00:49:22,251 --> 00:49:24,787
- You have two more left. - Just think you just started.

1256
00:49:24,787 --> 00:49:26,589
- Just think that. - Can you play rock-paper-scissors?

1257
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:28,157
(She seems to be ready to play.)

1258
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:30,126
(The fifth citizen doesn't seem ordinary.)

1259
00:49:30,126 --> 00:49:32,428
(Will he be able to continue his miracle?)

1260
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:33,663
Rock-paper-scissors.

1261
00:49:36,032 --> 00:49:38,367
(What a surprise! At this point, it's getting a bit scary.)

1262
00:49:38,367 --> 00:49:40,403
- Jae Seok. - You have to win just one more.

1263
00:49:40,403 --> 00:49:42,171
- Just this once. - I only have one person left.

1264
00:49:43,139 --> 00:49:44,173
(He led an unlucky life.)

1265
00:49:44,173 --> 00:49:45,174
Please.

1266
00:49:45,174 --> 00:49:48,144
(A miracle on Line 5 is granted to Jae Seok.)

1267
00:49:48,144 --> 00:49:51,647
(No one had hopes for this sixth match.)

1268
00:49:51,647 --> 00:49:55,551
(What will Jae Seok's fate be?)

1269
00:49:55,551 --> 00:49:56,786
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1270
00:49:56,786 --> 00:49:57,854
(He wins 6 times in a row!)

1271
00:49:57,854 --> 00:49:59,021
He did it!

1272
00:49:59,388 --> 00:50:01,357
(The universe is on his side.)

1273
00:50:02,692 --> 00:50:04,460
- I'm sorry. Are you all right? - I'm okay.

1274
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:05,962
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

1275
00:50:05,962 --> 00:50:07,029
He beat six people.

1276
00:50:07,029 --> 00:50:08,931
- I'm sorry. Are you okay? - How did he do this?

1277
00:50:09,065 --> 00:50:10,733
- This is amazing. - It's unbelievable.

1278
00:50:10,833 --> 00:50:12,401
- This is all thanks to you all. - This is awesome.

1279
00:50:12,869 --> 00:50:14,370
- Thank you all. - You did it, Jae Seok!

1280
00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:16,672
- You are the best. - How did you manage that?

1281
00:50:16,839 --> 00:50:18,374
- You did it. - You are so cool.

1282
00:50:18,774 --> 00:50:20,176
You are really cool.

1283
00:50:20,776 --> 00:50:21,844
Is it time now?

1284
00:50:21,844 --> 00:50:23,513
- We have to get 1 Push-Out Card. - There are 2 Push-Out Cards.

1285
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,883
If you draw the Taxi Card, you are unlucky again.

1286
00:50:26,883 --> 00:50:28,417
If you choose the Taxi Card, you're ruined.

1287
00:50:28,417 --> 00:50:30,887
If that's the case, we are doomed.

1288
00:50:31,254 --> 00:50:34,190
(A Push-Out Card is their only hope to have a chance at winning.)

1289
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:37,560
- Jae Seok. - I can't look.

1290
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:38,995
- I'll look. - Please.

1291
00:50:39,095 --> 00:50:42,198
(So far, they failed all the missions.)

1292
00:50:42,198 --> 00:50:45,134
(They must win this mission by all means.)

1293
00:50:45,134 --> 00:50:46,502
It's a Push-Out Card!

1294
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:50,606
(They are over the moon.)

1295
00:50:50,606 --> 00:50:51,674
Be quiet.

1296
00:50:52,308 --> 00:50:54,177
- This is amazing. - I picked the right one.

1297
00:50:54,177 --> 00:50:55,211
(Get off now.)

1298
00:50:57,313 --> 00:50:59,015
What is your ideal type?

1299
00:50:59,048 --> 00:51:00,483
- Are you asking Kwang Soo? - It's you.

1300
00:51:00,583 --> 00:51:01,751
It's you.

1301
00:51:01,951 --> 00:51:03,019
My ideal type is...

1302
00:51:03,819 --> 00:51:07,490
(The type of girl I like is...)

1303
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:09,292
Please get off now.

1304
00:51:09,792 --> 00:51:11,494
- Wait. - They were talking.

1305
00:51:11,861 --> 00:51:14,096
We were talking about my ideal type.

1306
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:15,498
Do we have to get off?

1307
00:51:15,498 --> 00:51:17,200
The other team utilized the Push-Out Card.

1308
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,901
(They were about to arrive at the restaurant.)

1309
00:51:18,901 --> 00:51:20,670
- They got the Push-Out Card? - Really?

1310
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:21,938
(Do we really have to get off?)

1311
00:51:21,938 --> 00:51:23,005
You must get off now.

1312
00:51:23,439 --> 00:51:24,840
- Let's get off. - All right. Let's get off first.

1313
00:51:26,042 --> 00:51:27,877
- Excuse us. - I'm sorry.

1314
00:51:29,579 --> 00:51:31,547
Another bus will come soon, right?

1315
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:33,549
- We can get on the same one, right? - Right.

1316
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:36,152
(Both teams are heading to a restaurant chosen by Jong Kook.)

1317
00:51:36,485 --> 00:51:40,690
The other team was only two stops away and was forced to get off.

1318
00:51:40,756 --> 00:51:42,892
- They were two stops away? - They are waiting for the bus?

1319
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:44,927
- They are that close? - They are waiting for the bus?

1320
00:51:45,127 --> 00:51:48,331
They are only two stops away? It's really close.

1321
00:51:48,531 --> 00:51:50,199
There might be a traffic jam in Yeongdeungpo.

1322
00:51:50,199 --> 00:51:52,435
That's possible. There are a lot of cars in that area.

1323
00:51:52,435 --> 00:51:54,270
We should win at least once.

1324
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:55,605
- That's my point too. - We must win at least once.

1325
00:51:55,972 --> 00:51:58,708
- It's frustrating. - They took all the hints.

1326
00:51:58,908 --> 00:52:00,443
(Team Jae Seok strikes a blow at Team Jong Kook.)

1327
00:52:00,443 --> 00:52:01,944
- This isn't the bus? - It won't go to Yeongdeungpo.

1328
00:52:01,944 --> 00:52:03,112
How about this?

1329
00:52:03,112 --> 00:52:05,081
- It's Bus 650! - I think it goes to Yeongdeungpo.

1330
00:52:05,214 --> 00:52:06,415
Get on.

1331
00:52:06,749 --> 00:52:08,217
It goes to Yeongdeungpo. Thank you.

1332
00:52:08,217 --> 00:52:09,352
The driver told me so.

1333
00:52:09,485 --> 00:52:11,320
(Could they have gotten close?)

1334
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:14,323
This stop is Yeongdeungpo Market Station.

1335
00:52:15,057 --> 00:52:16,192
Hey, we have to run.

1336
00:52:16,192 --> 00:52:17,260
(They arrive at Yeongdeungpo Market Station.)

1337
00:52:18,461 --> 00:52:20,796
- Thank you for your help. - Is this the eel restaurant?

1338
00:52:20,796 --> 00:52:22,832
- Thank you. Have a good day. - From exit 3,

1339
00:52:23,633 --> 00:52:24,900
- how far... - We're running.

1340
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,002
Can we just go straight?

1341
00:52:26,002 --> 00:52:27,069
It's exit 3.

1342
00:52:27,069 --> 00:52:28,104
(Just run.)

1343
00:52:28,871 --> 00:52:31,107
(They also arrive at their destination.)

1344
00:52:31,274 --> 00:52:32,608
We have to hurry.

1345
00:52:33,676 --> 00:52:34,977
Jae Seok, we have to rush.

1346
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:36,879
Seok Jin, which way do we go?

1347
00:52:36,879 --> 00:52:37,980
We have to find the parking lot.

1348
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:40,549
- Did the other team arrive yet? - Should we hurry?

1349
00:52:42,118 --> 00:52:45,788
(On the 3rd course, a secret item and roasted eel are at stake.)

1350
00:52:45,788 --> 00:52:47,223
(It's not over until it's over.)

1351
00:52:47,223 --> 00:52:48,924
- Let us go in now. - Hold on.

1352
00:52:48,924 --> 00:52:50,092
It must be somewhere around here.

1353
00:52:50,092 --> 00:52:52,061
(Which team will arrive first?)

1354
00:52:52,228 --> 00:52:55,631
The secrets of Running Man's Food Guide are...

1355
00:52:55,631 --> 00:52:56,899
(Chocolate, rice, barley, avocado)

1356
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:58,401
It can't be.

1357
00:52:58,434 --> 00:53:00,269
(7 items stir up an incredible twist.)

1358
00:53:00,269 --> 00:53:01,270
(No one can predict the end.)

1359
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:02,305
We don't have time.

1360
00:53:02,305 --> 00:53:03,673
(Who will win?)

1361
00:53:11,147 --> 00:53:14,650
(The third restaurant of Running Man's Food Guide)

1362
00:53:15,251 --> 00:53:16,619
(It's chewy.)

1363
00:53:16,619 --> 00:53:18,654
(It's also cost-appropriate.)

1364
00:53:19,088 --> 00:53:20,856
- Let us go in now. - Hold on.

1365
00:53:20,856 --> 00:53:21,857
It must be somewhere around here.

1366
00:53:23,059 --> 00:53:24,327
There it is!

1367
00:53:24,527 --> 00:53:26,062
- I found it. - There it is. Hello.

1368
00:53:26,062 --> 00:53:27,063
I got it.

1369
00:53:27,296 --> 00:53:28,664
There it is. It's over there!

1370
00:53:28,664 --> 00:53:29,732
(They must arrive before the other team does.)

1371
00:53:30,466 --> 00:53:35,604
(They arrive at their destination without taking a breather.)

1372
00:53:35,805 --> 00:53:39,942
(Team Jae Seok finally enters the eel restaurant.)

1373
00:53:40,409 --> 00:53:41,944
- You're here. - Hey, you are here.

1374
00:53:41,944 --> 00:53:43,846
(They are at ease.)

1375
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,315
(Those jerks...)

1376
00:53:47,450 --> 00:53:49,285
- Thank you. - My goodness.

1377
00:53:49,285 --> 00:53:50,353
Leave it.

1378
00:53:50,353 --> 00:53:53,255
(It's a famous eel restaurant in Yeongdeungpo for its soft texture.)

1379
00:53:53,255 --> 00:53:54,957
(This roasted eel goes...)

1380
00:53:54,957 --> 00:53:56,525
- It's tasty. - I can't believe it.

1381
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:57,626
(This roasted eel goes...)

1382
00:53:57,626 --> 00:53:59,929
(to these people.)

1383
00:53:59,929 --> 00:54:01,063
This is it.

1384
00:54:01,397 --> 00:54:03,899
(What a letdown. Give us some water.)

1385
00:54:03,899 --> 00:54:05,701
- Please give us some water. - This is delicious.

1386
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:07,536
They only drank water today.

1387
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:09,638
- This is your hint for this round. - All right.

1388
00:54:10,005 --> 00:54:13,309
(The winning team is also provided with peanuts.)

1389
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:15,211
- We got peanuts. - Peanuts.

1390
00:54:15,211 --> 00:54:17,012
We have peanuts here too.

1391
00:54:17,012 --> 00:54:18,614
Thank you for the food.

1392
00:54:19,315 --> 00:54:22,218
Why can't we win at least once? This is frustrating.

1393
00:54:22,218 --> 00:54:24,353
- I'm full. Thank you for the meal. - Thank you for the food.

1394
00:54:24,353 --> 00:54:25,821
(They head to the fourth restaurant.)

1395
00:54:26,088 --> 00:54:27,156
(Running Man's Food Guide)

1396
00:54:27,156 --> 00:54:30,893
(Braised spicy chicken, eel, octopus, and bulgogi restaurants.)

1397
00:54:31,794 --> 00:54:34,330
(Current status on items obtained by each team)

1398
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:36,399
- Hello. - I've been here a lot.

1399
00:54:36,399 --> 00:54:37,867
I had so many take-outs.

1400
00:54:37,867 --> 00:54:40,202
- There are outdoor tables. - I didn't know about this place.

1401
00:54:40,202 --> 00:54:41,537
Bo Mi, this is a famous restaurant.

1402
00:54:41,537 --> 00:54:43,305
- I've never been here. - A lot of people buy this dish.

1403
00:54:43,406 --> 00:54:45,040
Seok Jin chose this place, right?

1404
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,209
I also come here often.

1405
00:54:47,209 --> 00:54:48,444
- You do? - Yes.

1406
00:54:48,611 --> 00:54:50,112
- I'm glad. - This place is really popular.

1407
00:54:50,279 --> 00:54:52,214
This place is known for having big chicken drumsticks.

1408
00:54:52,214 --> 00:54:55,151
Whenever I come to this area for a shoot,

1409
00:54:55,151 --> 00:54:57,153
- I always get takeout. - You do?

1410
00:54:57,319 --> 00:54:59,488
- Of course. - This is delicious.

1411
00:55:01,056 --> 00:55:02,558
- What's wrong, Jae Seok? - If we lost again...

1412
00:55:02,992 --> 00:55:04,427
- What's up? - He's mad.

1413
00:55:04,427 --> 00:55:05,694
- I'm so mad. - You are not in a good mood.

1414
00:55:05,694 --> 00:55:07,763
I ran so much that I lost my appetite.

1415
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:09,398
Can I go to the hair salon?

1416
00:55:09,765 --> 00:55:12,501
- Why? - I think my hair got messy.

1417
00:55:12,668 --> 00:55:15,137
- He's really neat. - Were you in a bad mood like this?

1418
00:55:15,137 --> 00:55:16,639
Were you bickering at each other?

1419
00:55:16,739 --> 00:55:19,809
It's not that your team is good. We analyzed about your team.

1420
00:55:20,242 --> 00:55:22,578
Kwang Soo. Haha. What is your job in your team?

1421
00:55:22,578 --> 00:55:24,747
(He takes a shot at these two incompetent members.)

1422
00:55:24,747 --> 00:55:26,415
Me? Were you referring to me?

1423
00:55:26,415 --> 00:55:27,450
- Bo Mi... - Hold on.

1424
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:29,452
- To be honest, Bo Mi... - Bo Mi...

1425
00:55:29,452 --> 00:55:30,719
and Jong Kook. Hold on.

1426
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:33,222
Jong Kook and Bo Mi are facing the same problem.

1427
00:55:33,222 --> 00:55:35,391
- I can't believe this. - Bo Mi. You should tell him.

1428
00:55:35,391 --> 00:55:37,893
They radiate positive energy.

1429
00:55:37,893 --> 00:55:40,629
- They help us a lot. - You don't have to be nice here.

1430
00:55:40,763 --> 00:55:43,032
The last course of Running Man's Food Guide...

1431
00:55:43,032 --> 00:55:45,201
recommended by the members is...

1432
00:55:45,201 --> 00:55:48,938
a famous braised spicy chicken restaurant. It was Seok Jin's pick.

1433
00:55:48,938 --> 00:55:52,708
You will find out what the game is once you finish...

1434
00:55:53,209 --> 00:55:54,410
braised spicy chicken placed in front of you.

1435
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:56,579
- Really? - You can enjoy the food first.

1436
00:55:57,146 --> 00:55:58,614
- The spice stings your tongue. - It does.

1437
00:55:58,681 --> 00:56:00,583
- It feels like that. - We will eat this with rice.

1438
00:56:01,116 --> 00:56:04,220
(Braised spicy chicken tastes best when it's eaten with rice.)

1439
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:05,654
(It suits Min Yong's taste perfectly.)

1440
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:07,156
- Isn't this delicious? - It's good.

1441
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:09,124
Bo Mi. Try this.

1442
00:56:09,124 --> 00:56:11,327
- This is the delicious part. - Thank you.

1443
00:56:13,562 --> 00:56:14,797
Let's stir-fry the rice.

1444
00:56:15,164 --> 00:56:16,332
(She turns into an eater.)

1445
00:56:16,332 --> 00:56:17,566
This is tasty.

1446
00:56:17,566 --> 00:56:19,168
I'm glad we're finishing up with spicy food.

1447
00:56:19,435 --> 00:56:20,803
I think I ate the non-spicy one before.

1448
00:56:20,803 --> 00:56:22,171
You probably did.

1449
00:56:22,638 --> 00:56:24,440
Bo Mi can eat.

1450
00:56:24,807 --> 00:56:25,841
(She's on another level.)

1451
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:27,510
She slowly eats everything.

1452
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:29,478
We ate all the ingredients from land, sea, and air.

1453
00:56:29,612 --> 00:56:32,648
The highlight of braised spicy chicken is...

1454
00:56:32,648 --> 00:56:34,116
- fried rice. - It's fried rice!

1455
00:56:34,116 --> 00:56:35,117
Of course.

1456
00:56:35,117 --> 00:56:37,152
- It's very delicious. - It's great.

1457
00:56:37,152 --> 00:56:39,321
We will bring in fried rice.

1458
00:56:39,321 --> 00:56:41,524
This place is also famous for cooked glutinous rice.

1459
00:56:42,391 --> 00:56:43,592
- Gosh. - That's it.

1460
00:56:43,592 --> 00:56:46,028
(Is there a chopstick in the middle of the fried rice?)

1461
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:50,566
- We'll play the game with this. - You guys.

1462
00:56:50,566 --> 00:56:52,701
- I am good at this. - Are you?

1463
00:56:52,801 --> 00:56:55,037
- I used to do this with soil a lot. - That's right.

1464
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:56,906
- Our team will win this game. - Are you serious?

1465
00:56:56,906 --> 00:56:58,507
Ji Hyo, don't you worry. I mean it.

1466
00:56:58,507 --> 00:56:59,642
All right then.

1467
00:56:59,642 --> 00:57:00,910
The rule is simple.

1468
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:03,612
Players from each team will take turns...

1469
00:57:03,612 --> 00:57:06,282
to scoop out a spoonful of fried rice.

1470
00:57:06,282 --> 00:57:08,918
Whichever team tips over the chopstick will lose.

1471
00:57:09,485 --> 00:57:10,653
We have to eat what we scoop out, right?

1472
00:57:10,653 --> 00:57:12,821
- You must eat what you scoop out. - Of course. That's obvious.

1473
00:57:13,122 --> 00:57:15,391
- Let's begin. - Can I go first?

1474
00:57:15,424 --> 00:57:16,692
You have to eat what you spoon out.

1475
00:57:17,426 --> 00:57:18,494
(It's a generous amount.)

1476
00:57:18,794 --> 00:57:21,463
- You have a voracious appetite. - She does.

1477
00:57:21,463 --> 00:57:23,566
- She can eat. - We just started.

1478
00:57:23,566 --> 00:57:25,167
I'll spoon out a lot since it's only the start.

1479
00:57:25,935 --> 00:57:27,002
Right. We just began.

1480
00:57:27,002 --> 00:57:29,305
She looks great when she eats.

1481
00:57:29,405 --> 00:57:31,307
- Look at that. - Goodness.

1482
00:57:31,407 --> 00:57:33,008
She knows how to eat.

1483
00:57:33,008 --> 00:57:34,743
(The way she eats brings good luck.)

1484
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:36,946
(She's a fairy who knows how to eat.)

1485
00:57:37,646 --> 00:57:40,115
- Is it tasty? - Look at her eyes. She likes it.

1486
00:57:40,182 --> 00:57:42,384
- Min Yong is next. - Are we alternating?

1487
00:57:42,384 --> 00:57:44,920
- I played this a lot with soil. - You did?

1488
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,388
He said he was good at this.

1489
00:57:46,388 --> 00:57:47,890
Min Yong. You have to eat what you spoon out.

1490
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:49,491
(He penetrates into the middle.)

1491
00:57:49,491 --> 00:57:50,759
It's steaming.

1492
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:53,696
Why did you scoop out the inner part?

1493
00:57:53,696 --> 00:57:55,564
- It's warm inside. - This looks awkward now.

1494
00:57:56,031 --> 00:57:57,366
- Kwang Soo, you are up. - All right.

1495
00:57:57,533 --> 00:57:59,468
I think it needs some sesame oil.

1496
00:58:00,069 --> 00:58:01,403
It's only the beginning.

1497
00:58:01,403 --> 00:58:03,038
(He deeply breaks into the inner part.)

1498
00:58:04,206 --> 00:58:05,207
(He opens his mouth wide.)

1499
00:58:05,207 --> 00:58:07,743
- Kwang Soo has a huge mouth. - He's like a crocodile.

1500
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:09,845
- He's like a crocodile. - He is.

1501
00:58:09,845 --> 00:58:13,749
- I'm not like a crocodile. - He's a snake.

1502
00:58:13,749 --> 00:58:16,151
(They have to be careful. How would Seok Jin do it?)

1503
00:58:16,151 --> 00:58:18,654
- It's so good. - Take more.

1504
00:58:18,654 --> 00:58:20,723
(He scrapes a little bit.)

1505
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:24,026
- That's so cheap. Take some more. - It's good.

1506
00:58:24,026 --> 00:58:27,429
- It's up to me. This is a lot. - My goodness.

1507
00:58:27,463 --> 00:58:29,898
- You're barely licking it. - You have to do what you promised.

1508
00:58:29,898 --> 00:58:31,266
It's good but I'm full.

1509
00:58:31,266 --> 00:58:32,835
(The real game starts now.)

1510
00:58:32,835 --> 00:58:34,203
You have to take this much at least.

1511
00:58:34,637 --> 00:58:35,838
(Gobbling)

1512
00:58:36,238 --> 00:58:37,439
That looks messy.

1513
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:39,008
(I'll win and fill my belly too.)

1514
00:58:39,008 --> 00:58:42,111
- Good job. - It's sticky so it won't fall.

1515
00:58:42,411 --> 00:58:44,546
(She must digest fast.)

1516
00:58:44,546 --> 00:58:45,614
Take more.

1517
00:58:45,648 --> 00:58:48,083
(The rice tower gradually gets smaller.)

1518
00:58:48,083 --> 00:58:50,085
(The chopstick is not stable now.)

1519
00:58:50,085 --> 00:58:51,954
It tastes even better now.

1520
00:58:51,954 --> 00:58:55,257
- Can you eat this much, Bo Mi? - You eat a lot.

1521
00:58:55,257 --> 00:58:56,992
(The game will end soon.)

1522
00:58:57,893 --> 00:58:59,762
(It's Bo Mi's turn again.)

1523
00:58:59,762 --> 00:59:01,463
You eat a lot.

1524
00:59:01,463 --> 00:59:03,866
(A small movement may decide who loses the game.)

1525
00:59:03,866 --> 00:59:06,301
(She has to focus on the spoon...)

1526
00:59:06,301 --> 00:59:07,302
(and save the chopstick in the middle.)

1527
00:59:07,302 --> 00:59:10,639
- She's so good. - You can't say anything to her.

1528
00:59:10,639 --> 00:59:13,308
- Why? She's so good. - We don't have anything to say.

1529
00:59:13,308 --> 00:59:16,278
- What should we say? - She's good.

1530
00:59:16,278 --> 00:59:18,747
(Bo Mi is saved.)

1531
00:59:18,747 --> 00:59:21,350
(She takes a big spoon and makes it tough for the next person.)

1532
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:22,351
(Let's see her eat.)

1533
00:59:22,351 --> 00:59:23,452
What's wrong?

1534
00:59:23,619 --> 00:59:25,654
(It's Bo Mi's eating time.)

1535
00:59:25,654 --> 00:59:27,656
- Good job. - Thank you.

1536
00:59:27,656 --> 00:59:29,158
(It's about to topple over.)

1537
00:59:29,525 --> 00:59:31,727
(Don't you like what I did?)

1538
00:59:31,727 --> 00:59:34,396
(It's Min Yong's turn.)

1539
00:59:34,396 --> 00:59:36,699
Why would you compete over this?

1540
00:59:37,099 --> 00:59:38,167
Hey, hey.

1541
00:59:38,467 --> 00:59:39,535
(Pushing)

1542
00:59:39,568 --> 00:59:41,136
- Keep going. It's okay. - Do it.

1543
00:59:41,136 --> 00:59:43,639
(Keep going, Min Yong.)

1544
00:59:43,639 --> 00:59:45,240
- Keep going. - Do it.

1545
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,109
(He doesn't know anymore.)

1546
00:59:47,109 --> 00:59:48,444
- Good. - It's okay.

1547
00:59:48,444 --> 00:59:50,913
(He's bold like when he's shoveling.)

1548
00:59:50,913 --> 00:59:53,348
(How would this long game end?)

1549
00:59:54,183 --> 00:59:55,284
- Good job. - Hey.

1550
00:59:56,118 --> 00:59:57,553
(Falling)

1551
00:59:57,553 --> 01:00:00,389
(The tower falls apart.)

1552
01:00:00,389 --> 01:00:01,857
(What did you do?)

1553
01:00:02,825 --> 01:00:05,260
(He messed up.)

1554
01:00:07,162 --> 01:00:09,164
You said you were good.

1555
01:00:09,164 --> 01:00:11,734
(Team Jong Kook wins all the games.)

1556
01:00:12,134 --> 01:00:13,302
You barely scraped it.

1557
01:00:13,302 --> 01:00:14,737
(I want to turn back time.)

1558
01:00:14,737 --> 01:00:17,139
I'm sick of this now.

1559
01:00:17,139 --> 01:00:18,841
- I'm good at this. - Really?

1560
01:00:18,841 --> 01:00:21,510
(He said he's good in shoveling.)

1561
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:25,447
(He was all talk.)

1562
01:00:25,447 --> 01:00:28,383
(He made his team lose with just two turns.)

1563
01:00:28,383 --> 01:00:30,652
(Isn't he a spy?)

1564
01:00:30,652 --> 01:00:32,354
(They're sick of winning now.)

1565
01:00:32,354 --> 01:00:34,256
- You said you were good. - He's really bad.

1566
01:00:34,256 --> 01:00:36,759
(He was all talk and he messed up.)

1567
01:00:36,759 --> 01:00:38,994
- Are you a spy? - He must be.

1568
01:00:38,994 --> 01:00:41,830
(I want to go back home.)

1569
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:47,002
We're going to head to the giant claw crane in SBS lobby.

1570
01:00:47,002 --> 01:00:48,604
- Claw crane. - I saw it.

1571
01:00:49,538 --> 01:00:53,742
(Team Jong Kook gets 2 tries for winning and Team Jae Seok gets 1.)

1572
01:00:53,742 --> 01:00:56,345
- We'll win this one for sure. - Are you sure?

1573
01:00:56,345 --> 01:00:59,348
It's not just any ordinary claw crane.

1574
01:00:59,348 --> 01:01:02,751
You can put a name tag of a person inside the claw crane...

1575
01:01:02,751 --> 01:01:05,754
and if you pick the stuffed toy with their name on it,

1576
01:01:05,754 --> 01:01:08,056
they come to your team.

1577
01:01:08,056 --> 01:01:10,359
- We have to pick Bo Mi then. - We do.

1578
01:01:10,359 --> 01:01:12,394
- She has the hint. - We need to get Min Yong.

1579
01:01:12,394 --> 01:01:13,962
(1 hour ago on their way to have braised spicy chicken)

1580
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:16,999
I'm the guest here but I don't know what the hint is.

1581
01:01:16,999 --> 01:01:18,734
(They're supposed to know something.)

1582
01:01:18,734 --> 01:01:21,003
- Do you know what it is? - No, I don't.

1583
01:01:21,303 --> 01:01:24,640
- You do know. - It must be hidden somewhere.

1584
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:26,909
- You might not know it yet. - Do I...

1585
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:30,012
- What are you doing? - Do I...

1586
01:01:30,345 --> 01:01:31,947
(Coffee Min Yong)

1587
01:01:32,981 --> 01:01:35,217
(This is a real situation.)

1588
01:01:35,384 --> 01:01:39,454
- What are you doing? - I ripped to check. It's a hint.

1589
01:01:39,655 --> 01:01:42,224
(That's what it was.)

1590
01:01:42,224 --> 01:01:44,459
(It's better to have guests on their teams.)

1591
01:01:44,459 --> 01:01:45,861
- That startled me. - Then we...

1592
01:01:45,861 --> 01:01:48,664
(I need to win so that I take Bo Mi's item as well.)

1593
01:01:50,132 --> 01:01:53,202
- I have a claw crane at home. - Forget it.

1594
01:01:53,202 --> 01:01:56,405
(I have a claw crane at home.)

1595
01:01:56,405 --> 01:01:57,940
(That hurt him.)

1596
01:01:57,940 --> 01:02:00,609
- Stop it. - It's about time.

1597
01:02:00,642 --> 01:02:03,145
- He's persistent. He keeps going. - He's flustered.

1598
01:02:03,145 --> 01:02:06,048
- I know you now. - How shameless.

1599
01:02:06,048 --> 01:02:08,550
- Is it the claw type? - We have to get Bo Mi.

1600
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:10,352
- It is. - Okay. Let's go.

1601
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:12,020
(That's a piece of cake.)

1602
01:02:13,121 --> 01:02:16,391
You saw it, right? I have one at home.

1603
01:02:16,391 --> 01:02:19,661
- I have the same one at home. - It's small though.

1604
01:02:19,661 --> 01:02:22,030
It's the same principle.

1605
01:02:22,764 --> 01:02:24,666
(He keeps on flaunting.)

1606
01:02:24,666 --> 01:02:27,102
He flaunts. He flaunts so much.

1607
01:02:27,102 --> 01:02:29,738
What does the rice tower have to do with a sand tower?

1608
01:02:29,738 --> 01:02:33,709
Rice and sand are very different. I didn't realize.

1609
01:02:33,709 --> 01:02:35,644
Rice is stickier.

1610
01:02:35,644 --> 01:02:37,546
(He's not appreciated by his team.)

1611
01:02:37,546 --> 01:02:39,414
Let's get going first.

1612
01:02:39,514 --> 01:02:41,116
Fine. Go.

1613
01:02:42,284 --> 01:02:45,087
I'm lonely, Haha.

1614
01:02:45,621 --> 01:02:46,955
He's lonely.

1615
01:02:46,955 --> 01:02:48,156
(Their last mission will be held in SBS.)

1616
01:02:48,156 --> 01:02:50,659
- This is it. - It's huge.

1617
01:02:50,659 --> 01:02:52,027
(Have you seen a gigantic claw crane before?)

1618
01:02:52,027 --> 01:02:53,395
(It's made of a huge box that's 4m tall.)

1619
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:54,997
I haven't seen one this big.

1620
01:02:55,197 --> 01:02:56,665
It's huge.

1621
01:02:56,665 --> 01:03:00,168
- This looks so difficult. - It looks fun.

1622
01:03:00,168 --> 01:03:02,838
I have a problem. It's not the one I have at home.

1623
01:03:02,938 --> 01:03:04,206
(He's scared by how big it is.)

1624
01:03:04,206 --> 01:03:06,408
I have this small one at home.

1625
01:03:06,909 --> 01:03:08,343
Come on, Min Yong.

1626
01:03:08,343 --> 01:03:10,646
All right. I'll explain the rules.

1627
01:03:10,646 --> 01:03:13,048
Jong Kook will start.

1628
01:03:13,048 --> 01:03:15,350
There's a name tag on each stuffed toy.

1629
01:03:15,350 --> 01:03:18,720
It has Min Yong's name. If you win the stuffed toy,

1630
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:21,757
he comes to your team.

1631
01:03:22,224 --> 01:03:25,260
The name tag will change to Bo Mi's after.

1632
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:27,562
- Then the other team can go. - Okay.

1633
01:03:27,562 --> 01:03:29,731
Go ahead, Jong Kook.

1634
01:03:29,731 --> 01:03:32,167
- Who's going to go? - Each person can go once.

1635
01:03:32,167 --> 01:03:35,938
- Should we? - Do the one that's closest to you.

1636
01:03:35,938 --> 01:03:37,339
It's not easy.

1637
01:03:37,339 --> 01:03:38,941
(They take their time to pick the target.)

1638
01:03:38,941 --> 01:03:40,409
- Is this better? - Yes, it is.

1639
01:03:40,909 --> 01:03:42,644
(Jong Kook's 1st attempt)

1640
01:03:42,644 --> 01:03:44,947
- There's a time limit. - Does this even work?

1641
01:03:44,947 --> 01:03:46,081
(Let's look around.)

1642
01:03:46,081 --> 01:03:47,783
This is so huge.

1643
01:03:47,983 --> 01:03:50,185
- He won't be able to do it. - This is impossible.

1644
01:03:50,185 --> 01:03:53,188
- It's impossible. - There's seven seconds left.

1645
01:03:53,188 --> 01:03:55,757
- You have 6 seconds. - 5. Go right.

1646
01:03:55,757 --> 01:03:57,092
(He gets ready to press the button.)

1647
01:03:57,092 --> 01:03:59,094
- It's a fail. - I got it.

1648
01:03:59,094 --> 01:04:01,763
It won't work. Where are you aiming it?

1649
01:04:01,763 --> 01:04:04,466
(Will they get Min Yong or not? That is the question.)

1650
01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:07,369
(Will Jong Kook succeed?)

1651
01:04:08,270 --> 01:04:12,140
- I got it. - It won't work.

1652
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:13,742
- Please. - It needs to be positioned well.

1653
01:04:13,742 --> 01:04:14,910
(Min Yong is nervous as well.)

1654
01:04:14,943 --> 01:04:17,045
- Please. - It needs to be positioned well.

1655
01:04:17,045 --> 01:04:19,114
- It won't work. - Okay.

1656
01:04:19,114 --> 01:04:22,117
(He got it.)

1657
01:04:22,117 --> 01:04:25,187
(It has to reach the hole.)

1658
01:04:25,187 --> 01:04:29,257
(Where would Min Yong end up?)

1659
01:04:29,257 --> 01:04:32,561
- Please. - You have to get the legs.

1660
01:04:32,561 --> 01:04:34,997
- Okay. - He got it.

1661
01:04:34,997 --> 01:04:36,164
It didn't work.

1662
01:04:36,164 --> 01:04:39,067
(It falls within a second.)

1663
01:04:39,468 --> 01:04:40,469
It didn't work.

1664
01:04:40,469 --> 01:04:41,770
(It's not easy to succeed at once.)

1665
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:43,105
- That's right. - Go for that one.

1666
01:04:43,105 --> 01:04:44,639
(Last try goes to Kwang Soo.)

1667
01:04:44,639 --> 01:04:47,009
Didn't you see that? I told you to move back a bit.

1668
01:04:47,009 --> 01:04:49,544
- You should have moved it. - Worry about yourselves.

1669
01:04:49,544 --> 01:04:50,712
(Let's see how good you are.)

1670
01:04:50,712 --> 01:04:52,547
- Are you mad? - It was just too close.

1671
01:04:52,547 --> 01:04:54,449
We just need Bo Mi.

1672
01:04:54,449 --> 01:04:56,752
- Bo Mi! - Wait for us.

1673
01:04:56,752 --> 01:04:59,654
(It's their last chance to get Min Yong on their team.)

1674
01:04:59,654 --> 01:05:02,357
- In 8, 7, 6... - Why?

1675
01:05:02,357 --> 01:05:04,459
(The counting down makes him nervous.)

1676
01:05:04,459 --> 01:05:07,462
- You have enough time. - They're done.

1677
01:05:07,462 --> 01:05:09,297
- It won't work. - It's not easy.

1678
01:05:09,297 --> 01:05:10,465
(Time is now.)

1679
01:05:10,465 --> 01:05:13,168
- Please. - He's in a perfect position.

1680
01:05:13,168 --> 01:05:16,171
- It's a good position. - It's perfect.

1681
01:05:16,605 --> 01:05:18,306
(I have a good feeling.)

1682
01:05:18,306 --> 01:05:20,742
- You got it. - Looking good.

1683
01:05:20,742 --> 01:05:24,813
(He may be unlucky but this looks perfect.)

1684
01:05:24,813 --> 01:05:28,750
It's difficult to win in a few tries.

1685
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:33,055
(Will they get the stuffed toy with Min Yong's name on it?)

1686
01:05:33,355 --> 01:05:34,456
It's going to work.

1687
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:36,958
- He got it. - It's difficult to win.

1688
01:05:37,125 --> 01:05:38,126
It's going up!

1689
01:05:38,126 --> 01:05:40,562
(He picks it up.)

1690
01:05:40,562 --> 01:05:42,364
- He got it. - Please.

1691
01:05:42,364 --> 01:05:44,499
(Would he be lucky just for today?)

1692
01:05:44,499 --> 01:05:47,202
(Please hold on until the stuffed toy gets released.)

1693
01:05:47,202 --> 01:05:50,405
(What would be the result of this game?)

1694
01:05:50,405 --> 01:05:51,540
Please.

1695
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:52,841
(Slipping)

1696
01:05:52,841 --> 01:05:54,709
(Collapsing)

1697
01:05:55,610 --> 01:05:58,547
(The claw is unlucky like Kwang Soo.)

1698
01:05:58,547 --> 01:05:59,815
(His bad luck will last forever.)

1699
01:05:59,815 --> 01:06:01,650
It's difficult to win in a few tries.

1700
01:06:01,650 --> 01:06:03,952
(Team Jong Kook fails.)

1701
01:06:03,952 --> 01:06:06,188
- Okay. - It's difficult with two tries.

1702
01:06:06,188 --> 01:06:08,824
- We are done now. - Do you want to give it a try?

1703
01:06:08,824 --> 01:06:12,928
- Should I? It has to be standing. - I'll look for you.

1704
01:06:12,928 --> 01:06:15,097
Let's go for the one at the front. We don't have much options.

1705
01:06:15,097 --> 01:06:18,733
- Do you want to go for that one? - How much time do I have? This one.

1706
01:06:18,733 --> 01:06:20,168
(He finds his target.)

1707
01:06:20,168 --> 01:06:21,169
Okay!

1708
01:06:21,303 --> 01:06:23,138
- This one? - Yes.

1709
01:06:23,538 --> 01:06:26,308
- Should I go forward? - You're good on this side.

1710
01:06:27,209 --> 01:06:29,010
(He presses the button.)

1711
01:06:30,812 --> 01:06:33,715
(It goes down for Bo Mi's name.)

1712
01:06:34,816 --> 01:06:37,652
(What will happen to her?)

1713
01:06:37,652 --> 01:06:40,555
- Good. - It dodged.

1714
01:06:41,022 --> 01:06:44,392
- Good. - It's a perfect grip.

1715
01:06:44,392 --> 01:06:46,528
(He has a good feeling.)

1716
01:06:47,395 --> 01:06:48,964
(It's a perfect grip.)

1717
01:06:48,964 --> 01:06:50,265
I have a good feeling about this.

1718
01:06:51,032 --> 01:06:52,367
- Good. - I think we are done.

1719
01:06:52,367 --> 01:06:54,069
(It starts to move.)

1720
01:06:54,069 --> 01:06:57,339
(It just has to reach the hole.)

1721
01:06:57,339 --> 01:07:01,443
(They only have one chance to bring Bo Mi to their team.)

1722
01:07:01,443 --> 01:07:03,078
(His heart is thumping.)

1723
01:07:03,145 --> 01:07:05,013
- Okay! - Please.

1724
01:07:05,013 --> 01:07:07,749
(This claw crane will decide the two teams' fates.)

1725
01:07:07,749 --> 01:07:10,252
(Please hold on.)

1726
01:07:10,252 --> 01:07:11,453
(Her heart is racing.)

1727
01:07:11,453 --> 01:07:13,054
- Please. - No, Bo Mi.

1728
01:07:13,054 --> 01:07:16,625
(That's the exit hole.)

1729
01:07:17,092 --> 01:07:18,727
- Okay. - No way.

1730
01:07:18,727 --> 01:07:19,728
(Sliding)

1731
01:07:20,762 --> 01:07:22,731
(Team Jong Kook tries to protect Bo Mi,)

1732
01:07:22,731 --> 01:07:24,966
(and Team Jae Seok tries to steal her. This is the last game.)

1733
01:07:24,966 --> 01:07:26,668
Please, Ji Hyo.

1734
01:07:26,668 --> 01:07:29,171
(The team with the guests have the upper hand for the last mission.)

1735
01:07:29,171 --> 01:07:31,640
(Who will win this game?)

1736
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:34,509
- No, Bo Mi. - You can't take her.

1737
01:07:35,110 --> 01:07:37,045
- Please, Ji Hyo. - We got it.

1738
01:07:37,045 --> 01:07:38,613
No, Bo Mi.

1739
01:07:38,613 --> 01:07:40,248
(Dropping)

1740
01:07:40,248 --> 01:07:41,249
(They got it.)

1741
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:44,653
(Team Jae Seok gets Bo Mi in one try.)

1742
01:07:44,653 --> 01:07:47,155
(This turns the game around.)

1743
01:07:47,189 --> 01:07:50,058
- We did it. - We got it.

1744
01:07:50,058 --> 01:07:52,527
(Bo Mi gets transferred to Team Jae Seok.)

1745
01:07:52,527 --> 01:07:55,463
- What just happened? - Come here, Bo Mi.

1746
01:07:55,463 --> 01:07:57,465
- Sure. - Come here.

1747
01:07:57,465 --> 01:07:59,401
(They have both Min Yong and Bo Mi.)

1748
01:07:59,401 --> 01:08:01,770
(How would this race end?)

1749
01:08:01,770 --> 01:08:03,638
- We're in the same team now. - You look so happy, Bo Mi.

1750
01:08:03,638 --> 01:08:04,806
Give her a jacket.

1751
01:08:05,106 --> 01:08:06,441
Give her our pink jacket.

1752
01:08:06,441 --> 01:08:08,610
Bo Mi joins our team at last.

1753
01:08:08,643 --> 01:08:10,979
Here are the guest members' secrets.

1754
01:08:11,279 --> 01:08:13,915
Take off the guests' name tags.

1755
01:08:14,416 --> 01:08:15,984
Can we do it in the open?

1756
01:08:16,585 --> 01:08:17,686
(He takes it off.)

1757
01:08:17,752 --> 01:08:18,820
"Chocolate Bo Mi"?

1758
01:08:19,421 --> 01:08:20,488
- "Coffee Min Yong". - "Coffee Min Yong".

1759
01:08:20,488 --> 01:08:22,324
- Chocolate Bo Mi, Coffee Min Yong. - What's this?

1760
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:26,628
You'll play Hide and Seek to obtain ingredients you need.

1761
01:08:26,928 --> 01:08:27,963
Hide and Seek?

1762
01:08:27,963 --> 01:08:29,064
That sounds fun.

1763
01:08:29,064 --> 01:08:33,735
The teams will take turns with the time limit of five minutes.

1764
01:08:33,768 --> 01:08:36,838
The team must seek the other team that's hiding.

1765
01:08:37,138 --> 01:08:41,076
If you take off a name tag, you obtain the ingredient written on it.

1766
01:08:41,076 --> 01:08:42,911
How many ingredients can one person attach?

1767
01:08:43,144 --> 01:08:45,080
- It's up to you. - Really?

1768
01:08:45,146 --> 01:08:48,917
The perimeter is limited to the first floor lobby.

1769
01:08:49,017 --> 01:08:50,919
- Is it here? - It's in the lobby.

1770
01:08:50,919 --> 01:08:52,954
- Where can we hide? - Is there a place to hide?

1771
01:08:53,855 --> 01:08:55,290
Determine the order.

1772
01:08:55,790 --> 01:08:56,958
What should we do?

1773
01:08:57,525 --> 01:09:00,262
- We have to be strategic. - How?

1774
01:09:00,695 --> 01:09:04,165
It's not about running away. It's important to hide well.

1775
01:09:04,165 --> 01:09:07,469
Let's put all the ingredients on Ji Hyo and Bo Mi.

1776
01:09:07,669 --> 01:09:08,837
- All of them? - Yes.

1777
01:09:08,837 --> 01:09:10,338
Isn't it better to have one each?

1778
01:09:10,338 --> 01:09:11,640
Two is better.

1779
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:12,707
Will it be dangerous?

1780
01:09:12,707 --> 01:09:14,609
- How about Min Yong? - Do you want one?

1781
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:15,944
It's better to have one each.

1782
01:09:15,944 --> 01:09:18,213
- Do I have to hide? - Let's get one each.

1783
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:21,416
You can hide amongst the stuffed animals.

1784
01:09:21,516 --> 01:09:24,986
The other team will definitely consider it.

1785
01:09:25,353 --> 01:09:26,855
There aren't good places to hide.

1786
01:09:26,855 --> 01:09:28,023
(Kwang Soo has a hard time hiding.)

1787
01:09:28,023 --> 01:09:30,659
How about above the claw crane?

1788
01:09:30,859 --> 01:09:31,993
Can I climb up?

1789
01:09:32,227 --> 01:09:34,763
What's that behind?

1790
01:09:34,996 --> 01:09:37,299
There's a ladder.

1791
01:09:37,299 --> 01:09:39,768
We can climb up if there's a ladder.

1792
01:09:40,035 --> 01:09:41,136
Look.

1793
01:09:41,736 --> 01:09:44,139
We can fold the ladder after climbing up.

1794
01:09:44,139 --> 01:09:46,007
(Remove the ladder after using it.)

1795
01:09:46,941 --> 01:09:48,209
Attach everything on me.

1796
01:09:49,077 --> 01:09:52,347
No one can climb up without the ladder.

1797
01:09:52,347 --> 01:09:54,349
- Okay. - Should I take the ladder?

1798
01:09:55,016 --> 01:09:56,017
(Hide and Seek Round One starts.)

1799
01:09:56,017 --> 01:09:58,119
- Can you carry the ladder? - Once...

1800
01:09:58,253 --> 01:10:00,789
we remove their name tags, we can win.

1801
01:10:00,789 --> 01:10:02,057
Remove all their name tags.

1802
01:10:02,324 --> 01:10:04,759
Try to finish the game in round one.

1803
01:10:05,193 --> 01:10:06,761
We have more members, so we have an advantage.

1804
01:10:08,029 --> 01:10:09,197
(The hiding team has two minutes.)

1805
01:10:09,197 --> 01:10:11,733
It'll be fun.

1806
01:10:11,733 --> 01:10:13,968
- Do we start? - Yes.

1807
01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:16,638
Will you be okay?

1808
01:10:17,305 --> 01:10:19,908
- Hold it tight. - Okay, I will.

1809
01:10:19,908 --> 01:10:21,509
(Haha is bolder than before.)

1810
01:10:21,609 --> 01:10:22,610
Can you do it?

1811
01:10:22,610 --> 01:10:25,580
- There's a hole. - In the ladder?

1812
01:10:26,648 --> 01:10:28,717
- Move more to the side. - There's a hole.

1813
01:10:28,717 --> 01:10:31,086
(It's a big hole.)

1814
01:10:31,353 --> 01:10:32,587
What should we do?

1815
01:10:32,587 --> 01:10:33,588
(We're doomed.)

1816
01:10:33,755 --> 01:10:35,857
- What do we do? - Isn't it too high?

1817
01:10:36,925 --> 01:10:38,059
What should we do?

1818
01:10:38,626 --> 01:10:40,695
How about that coffee shop?

1819
01:10:41,162 --> 01:10:44,165
- Should we lift it up? - We can go inside for a while.

1820
01:10:44,399 --> 01:10:45,500
Thank you.

1821
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:47,102
Should we go inside?

1822
01:10:48,570 --> 01:10:50,638
(They enter the coffee shop.)

1823
01:10:54,409 --> 01:10:55,410
(He finds a space to hide.)

1824
01:10:55,410 --> 01:10:56,811
I'll hide in here.

1825
01:10:58,413 --> 01:10:59,981
(Haha finishes hiding.)

1826
01:10:59,981 --> 01:11:01,750
No one will find you here.

1827
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:03,151
Should we split the items?

1828
01:11:03,251 --> 01:11:05,587
Let's split them.

1829
01:11:05,587 --> 01:11:07,956
(They split the ingredients.)

1830
01:11:07,956 --> 01:11:08,990
Rice.

1831
01:11:08,990 --> 01:11:14,562
(Jong Kook, Haha, and Kwang Soo each get ingredients.)

1832
01:11:14,562 --> 01:11:16,331
You have one minute.

1833
01:11:16,331 --> 01:11:18,032
Please hide within one minute.

1834
01:11:18,032 --> 01:11:19,300
(1 minute remains.)

1835
01:11:20,001 --> 01:11:22,370
(Kwang Soo finds something behind the coffee shop.)

1836
01:11:22,370 --> 01:11:25,140
(He finds a podium.)

1837
01:11:25,907 --> 01:11:29,411
(He carries it with ease.)

1838
01:11:30,311 --> 01:11:33,982
(He passes the staff members and places the podium...)

1839
01:11:33,982 --> 01:11:36,885
(at an awkward place.)

1840
01:11:39,654 --> 01:11:42,023
Please start now. Hurry.

1841
01:11:43,558 --> 01:11:46,428
(Jong Kook finishes hiding Haha.)

1842
01:11:46,428 --> 01:11:47,762
Make sure no one can see me.

1843
01:11:48,329 --> 01:11:49,364
Okay.

1844
01:11:49,364 --> 01:11:51,332
(Haha's recording)

1845
01:11:53,435 --> 01:11:56,438
(Surprisingly, Haha is hiding in here.)

1846
01:11:56,438 --> 01:11:58,139
(He's fully hidden.)

1847
01:11:58,740 --> 01:12:01,209
(He has 15 seconds left.)

1848
01:12:01,810 --> 01:12:04,579
(Jong Kook's physique is difficult to hide.)

1849
01:12:04,579 --> 01:12:07,582
(He hides in front of the elevator.)

1850
01:12:09,751 --> 01:12:11,686
(The hiding team is ready.)

1851
01:12:11,686 --> 01:12:14,088
Please start now. Hurry.

1852
01:12:14,422 --> 01:12:15,757
Is everyone hiding?

1853
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:18,526
The hiding team should be hidden by now.

1854
01:12:18,526 --> 01:12:20,061
Let's finish in one round.

1855
01:12:20,061 --> 01:12:21,729
- Do we have 5 minutes? - Let's finish in 1 go.

1856
01:12:21,729 --> 01:12:22,797
Let's do that.

1857
01:12:22,964 --> 01:12:26,935
In 5, 4, 3,

1858
01:12:27,035 --> 01:12:28,203
- 2... - Finish it in 1 go.

1859
01:12:30,071 --> 01:12:32,140
(The seeking team starts.)

1860
01:12:34,709 --> 01:12:37,145
(Ji Hyo moves towards Kwang Soo.)

1861
01:12:37,145 --> 01:12:38,246
We have five minutes.

1862
01:12:39,747 --> 01:12:43,618
(She knows Kwang Soo usually hides behind staff members.)

1863
01:12:44,052 --> 01:12:46,488
(Please don't come here.)

1864
01:12:46,855 --> 01:12:49,324
(Will Ji Hyo spot Kwang Soo?)

1865
01:12:49,324 --> 01:12:50,458
(She turns around.)

1866
01:12:53,394 --> 01:12:54,529
Act naturally.

1867
01:12:56,531 --> 01:12:57,899
We have five minutes.

1868
01:12:57,899 --> 01:12:59,167
(The seeking team speeds up.)

1869
01:12:59,934 --> 01:13:02,437
(Min Yong searches the claw crane.)

1870
01:13:02,871 --> 01:13:03,938
No one is here.

1871
01:13:04,138 --> 01:13:05,707
(Where is everyone?)

1872
01:13:05,707 --> 01:13:06,708
I can't find anyone.

1873
01:13:07,842 --> 01:13:11,746
(Jae Seok approaches where Jong Kook is hiding.)

1874
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:15,650
(He searches near the reception desk.)

1875
01:13:16,351 --> 01:13:18,720
(He suddenly turns around.)

1876
01:13:19,254 --> 01:13:23,858
(Is he heading towards where Jong Kook is hiding?)

1877
01:13:28,696 --> 01:13:31,332
He's right here.

1878
01:13:31,466 --> 01:13:34,469
- I found you. Here he is. - I knew it.

1879
01:13:34,469 --> 01:13:36,804
I got Jong Kook and rice.

1880
01:13:37,238 --> 01:13:39,440
I got rice. I found Jong Kook.

1881
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:40,508
Catch him.

1882
01:13:41,009 --> 01:13:42,110
We don't have time.

1883
01:13:42,310 --> 01:13:44,746
He caught Jong Kook.

1884
01:13:45,346 --> 01:13:46,481
Where are the others?

1885
01:13:46,814 --> 01:13:47,916
Catch him.

1886
01:13:48,283 --> 01:13:49,484
We don't have time.

1887
01:13:49,484 --> 01:13:51,619
(Kwang Soo is right here.)

1888
01:13:52,453 --> 01:13:54,322
(He turns around again.)

1889
01:13:55,223 --> 01:13:57,926
(Is someone else hiding behind the podium?)

1890
01:13:57,926 --> 01:14:00,762
(Kwang Soo is at risk of being found.)

1891
01:14:00,762 --> 01:14:03,431
(What will happen to Kwang Soo with barley?)

1892
01:14:03,565 --> 01:14:04,732
Here's Kwang Soo.

1893
01:14:04,732 --> 01:14:06,534
(He finds Kwang Soo.)

1894
01:14:06,534 --> 01:14:07,702
Here's Kwang Soo.

1895
01:14:09,103 --> 01:14:10,738
- I found him. - How did you know?

1896
01:14:10,738 --> 01:14:12,840
- We just need to find Haha. - How did you find me?

1897
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:14,108
We need to find Haha.

1898
01:14:14,208 --> 01:14:16,210
- I got barley. - He's good at finding people.

1899
01:14:16,311 --> 01:14:18,913
- We need to find Haha. - We only need to find Haha.

1900
01:14:18,913 --> 01:14:20,615
It's over once we find Haha.

1901
01:14:21,082 --> 01:14:23,384
You have two minutes left.

1902
01:14:23,551 --> 01:14:25,186
We only need to find Haha.

1903
01:14:25,486 --> 01:14:28,156
(They won't find where Haha is hiding.)

1904
01:14:28,890 --> 01:14:30,858
We only need to find Haha.

1905
01:14:30,858 --> 01:14:32,060
How did he find me?

1906
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:33,628
(Haha is struggling inside a trash bag.)

1907
01:14:35,396 --> 01:14:37,532
(The game is over once Haha is found.)

1908
01:14:37,532 --> 01:14:38,766
Here are the staff members.

1909
01:14:40,568 --> 01:14:42,103
He's too small to find.

1910
01:14:42,103 --> 01:14:43,438
(He gets anxious.)

1911
01:14:43,438 --> 01:14:44,606
Where's Haha?

1912
01:14:44,639 --> 01:14:45,940
It's hard to find him.

1913
01:14:46,808 --> 01:14:49,077
Haha should have kept all the ingredients.

1914
01:14:49,077 --> 01:14:50,144
Bo Mi.

1915
01:14:50,345 --> 01:14:53,147
Check inside the women's restroom.

1916
01:14:53,514 --> 01:14:55,950
It's difficult to find where Haha is hiding.

1917
01:14:56,351 --> 01:14:58,953
He should have kept them all.

1918
01:14:58,953 --> 01:15:00,421
(It's challenging to find Haha.)

1919
01:15:02,490 --> 01:15:03,625
Where did he go?

1920
01:15:03,625 --> 01:15:05,393
(They looked almost everywhere.)

1921
01:15:05,994 --> 01:15:10,198
(Jae Seok senses something and approaches the coffee shop.)

1922
01:15:10,198 --> 01:15:11,799
(Is that Seok Jin?)

1923
01:15:11,799 --> 01:15:13,034
I'm sorry.

1924
01:15:14,102 --> 01:15:15,470
May I take a look?

1925
01:15:16,004 --> 01:15:17,205
I'm sorry.

1926
01:15:17,205 --> 01:15:18,740
(No way.)

1927
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:20,808
I'm sorry.

1928
01:15:20,808 --> 01:15:22,810
(Haha is in trouble.)

1929
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:26,614
May I take a look?

1930
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:30,518
May I take a look?

1931
01:15:33,154 --> 01:15:35,690
(Seok Jin is in front of Haha.)

1932
01:15:36,491 --> 01:15:39,560
(Once Haha is found, Team Jong Kook loses.)

1933
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:40,995
(What will happen to him?)

1934
01:15:41,329 --> 01:15:42,430
He's not here.

1935
01:15:42,430 --> 01:15:43,498
(He gives up quickly.)

1936
01:15:44,565 --> 01:15:46,868
(Haha is relieved.)

1937
01:15:49,237 --> 01:15:50,338
(They have 10 seconds left.)

1938
01:15:50,338 --> 01:15:52,240
In 9, 8...

1939
01:15:52,507 --> 01:15:55,410
Have you seen Haha?

1940
01:15:55,410 --> 01:15:56,511
(Min Yong gets desperate.)

1941
01:15:58,012 --> 01:16:00,181
(He's frustrated.)

1942
01:16:00,181 --> 01:16:01,249
Where is he?

1943
01:16:01,482 --> 01:16:03,317
I can't check inside the claw crane.

1944
01:16:03,317 --> 01:16:04,452
(Time is up.)

1945
01:16:04,452 --> 01:16:06,020
I can't find him.

1946
01:16:07,455 --> 01:16:08,456
I couldn't find him.

1947
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:11,092
Okay.

1948
01:16:11,092 --> 01:16:13,227
(Haha survives.)

1949
01:16:13,961 --> 01:16:15,430
(He returns in glory.)

1950
01:16:15,430 --> 01:16:16,464
I did it.

1951
01:16:17,298 --> 01:16:19,167
I did it.

1952
01:16:19,167 --> 01:16:20,535
(Team Jong Kook wins seafood and peanuts.)

1953
01:16:20,535 --> 01:16:23,104
Haha should have kept all the items.

1954
01:16:23,104 --> 01:16:24,572
That was amazing.

1955
01:16:24,639 --> 01:16:26,140
We'll keep one each.

1956
01:16:26,207 --> 01:16:27,308
Each person keeps two.

1957
01:16:27,642 --> 01:16:28,710
You keep it.

1958
01:16:28,710 --> 01:16:30,411
I found a place that's hard to find.

1959
01:16:30,411 --> 01:16:32,080
- You should hide there. - All right.

1960
01:16:32,213 --> 01:16:34,115
- Aren't you keeping one? - No, I won't.

1961
01:16:34,248 --> 01:16:36,284
- Shouldn't we keep one each? - I'll disappoint them.

1962
01:16:36,684 --> 01:16:38,820
- Really? - They'll get exhausted too.

1963
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:41,656
They'll be disappointed to find that I have nothing.

1964
01:16:42,156 --> 01:16:44,392
- Let's find all of them. - Will we win?

1965
01:16:44,392 --> 01:16:45,426
We have to find them all.

1966
01:16:46,294 --> 01:16:47,662
- Let's hide. - They won't find me.

1967
01:16:47,662 --> 01:16:49,464
We can do it.

1968
01:16:49,464 --> 01:16:51,032
Bo Mi, Ji Hyo, hide well.

1969
01:16:51,032 --> 01:16:52,533
This is where I was talking about.

1970
01:16:52,667 --> 01:16:54,335
- This podium? - No, this one.

1971
01:16:54,602 --> 01:16:55,903
What's this?

1972
01:16:56,204 --> 01:16:57,605
It's a big stuffed animal.

1973
01:16:57,939 --> 01:17:01,075
- It's easy to look past it. - You're right.

1974
01:17:01,075 --> 01:17:02,643
- Do you want to hide here? - Yes.

1975
01:17:02,944 --> 01:17:04,345
- Wait a minute. - Can you film?

1976
01:17:04,345 --> 01:17:05,480
- Yes. - Wait.

1977
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,815
It doesn't look obvious.

1978
01:17:08,583 --> 01:17:09,817
I'm good.

1979
01:17:11,652 --> 01:17:12,787
I'm good now.

1980
01:17:12,787 --> 01:17:14,889
(She's completely hidden.)

1981
01:17:15,757 --> 01:17:16,824
It's difficult.

1982
01:17:16,824 --> 01:17:19,594
(Where will the other members hide?)

1983
01:17:19,594 --> 01:17:20,695
- Is anyone in here? - Min Yong.

1984
01:17:20,695 --> 01:17:23,431
- Can you go inside? - Let me try it.

1985
01:17:23,431 --> 01:17:25,133
- Just go in there. - I know.

1986
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:27,101
Gosh.

1987
01:17:27,101 --> 01:17:29,036
(He struggles to fit inside.)

1988
01:17:29,637 --> 01:17:32,073
(Seok Jin hides carefully as he has two items.)

1989
01:17:32,073 --> 01:17:33,107
Give that to me.

1990
01:17:33,107 --> 01:17:35,409
- The camera? - Give me that.

1991
01:17:35,409 --> 01:17:37,378
- Which one? - That one.

1992
01:17:37,378 --> 01:17:38,412
I'll hide here.

1993
01:17:38,412 --> 01:17:40,715
(Where did Jae Seok choose?)

1994
01:17:40,715 --> 01:17:41,749
I'll hide here.

1995
01:17:42,517 --> 01:17:44,952
I'll hide right here.

1996
01:17:45,153 --> 01:17:49,023
(He enters the claw crane.)

1997
01:17:49,023 --> 01:17:52,460
(Where will Bo Mi decide to hide?)

1998
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:53,528
Where should I hide?

1999
01:17:54,629 --> 01:17:56,664
Can I hide inside?

2000
01:17:56,764 --> 01:17:57,765
Thank you.

2001
01:17:57,932 --> 01:17:59,567
May I hide behind the trash can?

2002
01:18:00,735 --> 01:18:02,236
Was Haha here?

2003
01:18:02,236 --> 01:18:03,237
(He hid there.)

2004
01:18:03,237 --> 01:18:04,305
Did he hide here?

2005
01:18:04,572 --> 01:18:05,740
(He hid there before.)

2006
01:18:05,740 --> 01:18:08,109
Really? He'll definitely find me here.

2007
01:18:08,509 --> 01:18:09,610
Wait.

2008
01:18:09,610 --> 01:18:11,179
This is where he was.

2009
01:18:11,879 --> 01:18:12,914
My goodness.

2010
01:18:14,549 --> 01:18:16,417
Can you switch your uniform with me?

2011
01:18:16,417 --> 01:18:18,119
- Me? - I'm really sorry. It's just once.

2012
01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:22,757
(She pretends like she's a barista.)

2013
01:18:22,957 --> 01:18:27,595
(She changes her clothes instead of hiding.)

2014
01:18:28,930 --> 01:18:30,731
May I borrow your glasses?

2015
01:18:30,731 --> 01:18:33,568
I'm really sorry. Thank you.

2016
01:18:34,035 --> 01:18:35,102
It's okay.

2017
01:18:35,102 --> 01:18:36,437
(She's meticulous.)

2018
01:18:38,439 --> 01:18:41,108
(Find me if you can.)

2019
01:18:41,242 --> 01:18:42,844
Where was that spot?

2020
01:18:43,511 --> 01:18:45,246
Is there nowhere for me to hide?

2021
01:18:45,246 --> 01:18:47,615
(Min Yong hesitates until the end.)

2022
01:18:48,115 --> 01:18:49,684
You have 10 seconds.

2023
01:18:49,717 --> 01:18:52,520
I'll just stand naturally.

2024
01:18:53,788 --> 01:18:55,189
I'll greet them naturally.

2025
01:18:55,456 --> 01:18:59,060
(They're done hiding.)

2026
01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:00,695
- In 4, - There's nowhere to hide.

2027
01:19:00,695 --> 01:19:03,464
- Right? - 3, 2,

2028
01:19:07,969 --> 01:19:09,971
(They have to collect all 7 items in 5 minutes.)

2029
01:19:09,971 --> 01:19:11,739
- This is first floor, right? - Yes.

2030
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:16,911
(Where could they be?)

2031
01:19:17,011 --> 01:19:21,215
(Make sure you hide well. Your hair might get ripped off.)

2032
01:19:23,618 --> 01:19:28,222
(Does Kwang Soo head straight for the bathroom?)

2033
01:19:28,422 --> 01:19:33,494
(Would he greet him naturally?)

2034
01:19:37,398 --> 01:19:38,466
(Seok Jin is hiding in here.)

2035
01:19:38,466 --> 01:19:39,533
Give me that.

2036
01:19:39,533 --> 01:19:41,736
- This? - Yes.

2037
01:19:41,736 --> 01:19:43,938
(Seok Jin is hiding in here.)

2038
01:19:43,938 --> 01:19:45,840
(How did Kwang Soo know right away?)

2039
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,041
Okay.

2040
01:19:47,408 --> 01:19:49,410
I was going to hide here but decided not to.

2041
01:19:50,111 --> 01:19:52,146
- Check it out. - Should I?

2042
01:19:52,146 --> 01:19:53,748
(Team Jong Kook was hiding 15 minutes ago.)

2043
01:19:53,748 --> 01:19:55,149
I can go in here.

2044
01:19:55,149 --> 01:19:56,183
(They already found this spot.)

2045
01:19:56,183 --> 01:19:57,785
This is good.

2046
01:19:57,952 --> 01:19:59,921
I was going to hide here but decided not to.

2047
01:20:00,554 --> 01:20:02,023
This is tall.

2048
01:20:03,190 --> 01:20:05,626
(I shouldn't have done that.)

2049
01:20:06,761 --> 01:20:07,962
There must be...

2050
01:20:08,496 --> 01:20:09,597
There's somebody here.

2051
01:20:11,098 --> 01:20:14,835
(Did he get caught?)

2052
01:20:14,835 --> 01:20:16,203
Seok Jin!

2053
01:20:16,404 --> 01:20:19,140
Seok Jin! I found him.

2054
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:21,609
- Seok Jin. - How did you know?

2055
01:20:21,809 --> 01:20:23,344
I don't have to rip his name tag, right?

2056
01:20:23,778 --> 01:20:24,779
My goodness.

2057
01:20:24,779 --> 01:20:25,780
How did you know?

2058
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:27,381
I was going to hide here earlier but decided not to.

2059
01:20:29,150 --> 01:20:30,518
I guess it looked different before.

2060
01:20:30,518 --> 01:20:32,253
Chocolate and rice.

2061
01:20:32,253 --> 01:20:34,021
Why did he give it to me?

2062
01:20:38,059 --> 01:20:40,394
(Kwang Soo turns around.)

2063
01:20:40,394 --> 01:20:45,967
(Did Min Yong get caught?)

2064
01:20:45,967 --> 01:20:48,703
(Dashing)

2065
01:20:48,703 --> 01:20:51,439
(That radio booth looks fishy.)

2066
01:20:52,406 --> 01:20:55,810
(Why won't he come here?)

2067
01:20:55,810 --> 01:20:59,680
(This is too intense.)

2068
01:21:00,448 --> 01:21:02,917
(3 minutes 30 seconds left until this round is over.)

2069
01:21:04,051 --> 01:21:07,722
(The coffee shop looks fishy.)

2070
01:21:07,722 --> 01:21:13,527
(Would someone be in Haha's hiding place?)

2071
01:21:20,735 --> 01:21:26,907
(She looks somewhat like Bo Mi but maybe not.)

2072
01:21:26,907 --> 01:21:28,009
- Bo Mi? - Yes.

2073
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:30,644
(Peekaboo)

2074
01:21:30,644 --> 01:21:32,780
Let's go, Bo Mi.

2075
01:21:32,780 --> 01:21:34,215
This wasn't supposed to be it.

2076
01:21:34,982 --> 01:21:37,551
Get changed, Bo Mi.

2077
01:21:38,419 --> 01:21:40,021
I got caught right away.

2078
01:21:40,321 --> 01:21:43,424
(Team Jae Seok has 2 items left.)

2079
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:45,092
Who's here?

2080
01:21:45,593 --> 01:21:47,361
How do you go inside the claw crane?

2081
01:21:47,361 --> 01:21:49,296
(Jong Kook heads towards the claw crane.)

2082
01:21:49,296 --> 01:21:51,332
(Is his intuition right?)

2083
01:21:51,332 --> 01:21:53,000
How do you go inside the claw crane?

2084
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,035
(My goodness)

2085
01:21:55,870 --> 01:21:57,638
How do you go inside the claw crane?

2086
01:21:57,638 --> 01:22:01,909
(Someone is probably hiding in here.)

2087
01:22:01,909 --> 01:22:03,644
(Banging)

2088
01:22:03,644 --> 01:22:04,812
How do you open this?

2089
01:22:05,212 --> 01:22:07,681
(The situation is imminent.)

2090
01:22:07,681 --> 01:22:08,916
How do you get in?

2091
01:22:09,884 --> 01:22:14,255
(What would happen to Jae Seok?)

2092
01:22:14,255 --> 01:22:15,523
Like this?

2093
01:22:16,123 --> 01:22:17,291
Here he is.

2094
01:22:17,792 --> 01:22:18,926
(Here he is.)

2095
01:22:18,926 --> 01:22:20,561
(He gets caught right away.)

2096
01:22:20,561 --> 01:22:22,063
- My gosh. - Hurry up.

2097
01:22:22,063 --> 01:22:23,164
Come out.

2098
01:22:23,164 --> 01:22:24,398
My gosh.

2099
01:22:24,398 --> 01:22:26,200
- Why? - Come out.

2100
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:27,902
What's wrong with you?

2101
01:22:27,902 --> 01:22:29,036
(He doesn't have anything.)

2102
01:22:29,136 --> 01:22:31,338
He doesn't have anything.

2103
01:22:31,338 --> 01:22:33,607
Did you get caught? I did too.

2104
01:22:34,809 --> 01:22:36,310
I had a great hiding spot.

2105
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:38,979
(Min Yong and Ji Hyo are still hiding.)

2106
01:22:39,613 --> 01:22:42,116
Who's still missing?

2107
01:22:42,183 --> 01:22:46,921
(There's 1 minute and 30 seconds left.)

2108
01:22:46,921 --> 01:22:48,389
They're nowhere.

2109
01:22:49,156 --> 01:22:50,357
Let's see.

2110
01:22:50,357 --> 01:22:51,826
We only need one chance.

2111
01:22:51,826 --> 01:22:53,360
That's all we need.

2112
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:54,829
This won't open.

2113
01:22:54,829 --> 01:22:56,330
It won't open.

2114
01:22:56,330 --> 01:22:58,265
I found Jae Seok in the claw crane.

2115
01:22:59,166 --> 01:23:02,236
(He's right by Ji Hyo's hiding place.)

2116
01:23:02,837 --> 01:23:05,539
(Shuddering)

2117
01:23:06,574 --> 01:23:08,142
(Does he have a hunch?)

2118
01:23:08,142 --> 01:23:09,443
Who's missing?

2119
01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:10,878
(Kicking)

2120
01:23:11,345 --> 01:23:14,315
(That was a big impact.)

2121
01:23:15,116 --> 01:23:17,718
(Is this a giant doll?)

2122
01:23:17,718 --> 01:23:19,153
There's someone in here.

2123
01:23:19,487 --> 01:23:20,521
It's here.

2124
01:23:20,855 --> 01:23:22,356
Who's this?

2125
01:23:22,356 --> 01:23:23,824
There's someone in here.

2126
01:23:24,125 --> 01:23:26,994
It's here. Who's this?

2127
01:23:26,994 --> 01:23:28,062
(Ji Hyo stays quiet and doesn't move.)

2128
01:23:28,062 --> 01:23:30,097
Hold on. Isn't this it?

2129
01:23:30,097 --> 01:23:32,266
It must be a person. She has long hair. It's Ji Hyo.

2130
01:23:32,266 --> 01:23:34,435
Ji Hyo. Ji Hyo?

2131
01:23:35,269 --> 01:23:36,303
Ji Hyo?

2132
01:23:37,037 --> 01:23:38,806
Come out, Ji Hyo.

2133
01:23:38,939 --> 01:23:40,908
Ji Hyo.

2134
01:23:41,408 --> 01:23:42,610
She's out.

2135
01:23:43,077 --> 01:23:44,411
Who's left now?

2136
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:46,247
- Whom did you find? - Ji Hyo.

2137
01:23:46,247 --> 01:23:47,515
- You found her? - Yes.

2138
01:23:47,615 --> 01:23:48,949
How much time do they have?

2139
01:23:48,949 --> 01:23:50,551
We're missing Min Yong.

2140
01:23:51,051 --> 01:23:52,386
It's just him?

2141
01:23:53,087 --> 01:23:55,256
It's just you! Hold on!

2142
01:23:59,326 --> 01:24:02,296
Why are you standing like this? You should have done this earlier.

2143
01:24:03,864 --> 01:24:08,435
(They don't think he's in an obvious spot like the bathroom.)

2144
01:24:08,435 --> 01:24:10,738
It's long.

2145
01:24:10,738 --> 01:24:11,739
It's eerie.

2146
01:24:11,939 --> 01:24:14,608
What about the bathroom?

2147
01:24:14,608 --> 01:24:17,945
(He heads to the bathroom.)

2148
01:24:18,078 --> 01:24:21,482
(There's only 10 seconds left. What would happen?)

2149
01:24:21,482 --> 01:24:22,983
What about the bathroom?

2150
01:24:23,017 --> 01:24:25,586
(There's only 10 seconds left. What would happen?)

2151
01:24:25,619 --> 01:24:31,458
(He looks at the mirror by the door.)

2152
01:24:31,725 --> 01:24:33,961
It's just you! Hold on!

2153
01:24:33,961 --> 01:24:36,864
(Just a little bit more, Min Yong.)

2154
01:24:37,498 --> 01:24:38,766
He scared me.

2155
01:24:38,766 --> 01:24:41,502
(He finds Min Yong with a few seconds left.)

2156
01:24:41,602 --> 01:24:44,071
He scared me.

2157
01:24:44,338 --> 01:24:45,639
He scared me.

2158
01:24:45,639 --> 01:24:46,707
Why did you scare me?

2159
01:24:46,707 --> 01:24:48,108
You scared me.

2160
01:24:48,108 --> 01:24:49,810
- Did he get caught? - He got caught.

2161
01:24:49,810 --> 01:24:51,445
- He got caught. - Did you find him?

2162
01:24:52,012 --> 01:24:53,847
Everybody got caught. It's over.

2163
01:24:53,914 --> 01:24:56,150
- Really? - I found Min Yong.

2164
01:24:56,517 --> 01:24:59,253
(Team Jae Seok is out.)

2165
01:24:59,253 --> 01:25:01,555
Today's winning team...

2166
01:25:01,555 --> 01:25:03,224
is Team Jong Kook.

2167
01:25:03,224 --> 01:25:06,594
(Team Jong Kook is the winner of Running Man's Food Guide.)

2168
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:08,195
- That was close. - Bo Mi.

2169
01:25:08,195 --> 01:25:09,997
- We have you in our hearts. - That was close.

2170
01:25:10,197 --> 01:25:12,266
- We consider you one of us. - That's right.

2171
01:25:12,266 --> 01:25:14,134
The secret to...

2172
01:25:14,134 --> 01:25:15,936
Running Man's Food Guide...

2173
01:25:16,203 --> 01:25:18,539
had to do with food that might disappear.

2174
01:25:18,539 --> 01:25:20,941
(It had to do with food that might disappear.)

2175
01:25:21,208 --> 01:25:22,509
- What? - Why?

2176
01:25:24,178 --> 01:25:26,580
The Daily Mirror, a British national tabloid newspaper,

2177
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:29,283
announced eight food items that'll go extinct due to climate change.

2178
01:25:29,283 --> 01:25:31,318
- No way. - Seven of them are...

2179
01:25:31,318 --> 01:25:32,953
- in front of you. - No way.

2180
01:25:32,953 --> 01:25:34,255
We can't live without rice.

2181
01:25:34,255 --> 01:25:36,090
- Chocolate will disappear? - Peanuts too?

2182
01:25:36,090 --> 01:25:37,458
- Barely too? - Coffee.

2183
01:25:37,458 --> 01:25:40,828
You must be interested and invested...

2184
01:25:40,828 --> 01:25:43,364
in order to enjoy these items for a longer time.

2185
01:25:43,497 --> 01:25:46,667
Team Jong Kook won today's race,

2186
01:25:46,867 --> 01:25:48,669
so they get...

2187
01:25:48,669 --> 01:25:51,639
these seven items as a prize.

2188
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:54,642
- That's so meaningful. - I agree.

2189
01:25:54,642 --> 01:25:57,244
Can Min Yong and Bo Mi...

2190
01:25:57,244 --> 01:25:58,846
say something?

2191
01:25:58,846 --> 01:26:00,147
- Something simple? - Yes.

2192
01:26:00,147 --> 01:26:01,849
I feel bad.

2193
01:26:01,949 --> 01:26:04,218
I was happy to have met Bo Mi.

2194
01:26:05,019 --> 01:26:07,187
What about you, Bo Mi?

2195
01:26:07,187 --> 01:26:08,255
I had so much fun...

2196
01:26:08,255 --> 01:26:11,659
and I realized the importance of positive energy.

2197
01:26:11,659 --> 01:26:12,926
- Really? - I'll come back...

2198
01:26:12,926 --> 01:26:15,329
- when I'm skinnier. - You're pretty already.

2199
01:26:15,329 --> 01:26:16,964
- Stop it. - Please stop.

2200
01:26:17,131 --> 01:26:19,433
- You're already pretty. - Please, Bo Mi.

2201
01:26:19,533 --> 01:26:22,169
We'll be back next week. Thank you.

2202
01:26:22,169 --> 01:26:23,470
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2203
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:27,141
(Thank you Min Yong and Bo Mi for joining us.)

2204
01:26:27,908 --> 01:26:31,512
Today is Booking King Race.

2205
01:26:31,712 --> 01:26:32,880
Booking?

2206
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:34,248
(We have invited booking kings for today's race.)

2207
01:26:34,248 --> 01:26:35,582
He's so sexy.

2208
01:26:35,582 --> 01:26:37,451
- Would you like to join me? - Of course.

2209
01:26:37,451 --> 01:26:40,254
Who booked for me?

2210
01:26:40,254 --> 01:26:41,755
(They must become booking kings of this territory.)

2211
01:26:41,755 --> 01:26:43,324
- What is the booker's name? - Sandara Park.

2212
01:26:44,458 --> 01:26:45,793
(And)

2213
01:26:46,327 --> 01:26:48,329
(A man with another goal.)

2214
01:26:48,329 --> 01:26:49,730
- Keep going. - Go.

2215
01:26:49,730 --> 01:26:51,532
- Does this make any sense? - What was that?

2216
01:26:51,532 --> 01:26:52,766
He's there.

2217
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:54,034
Hey.

2218
01:26:54,034 --> 01:26:56,437
- Jae Seok is acting by himself. - I wonder what the mission is.
