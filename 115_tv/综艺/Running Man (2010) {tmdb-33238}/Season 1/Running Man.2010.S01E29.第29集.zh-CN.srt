1
00:00:06,349 --> 00:00:08,695
So, have a nice day!

2
00:00:08,695 --> 00:00:10,185
That's ruined now anyway.

3
00:00:10,185 --> 00:00:11,141
Why?

4
00:00:11,141 --> 00:00:12,451
Because you're leaving.

5
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:14,048
You fool!

6
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:17,227
I really hate to interrupt you, but either I take care of our milk supply

7
00:00:17,227 --> 00:00:19,560
and you take care of table 9 or the other way around,

8
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:21,049
or we tell everyone to leave and close.

9
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,004
Okay, I'll take care of table... - ...9 ! And I'm in the basement.

10
00:00:23,004 --> 00:00:23,944
Well, and I'm off!

11
00:00:23,943 --> 00:00:25,439
Yeah, you all just go and abandon me!

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,940
I'm so sorry!

13
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,397
Hey! - Oh, hi!

14
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:33,042
Err...are you together?

15
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:36,263
Well, are you...?

16
00:00:37,756 --> 00:00:40,214
Happy for you! Bye! - Thank you!

17
00:00:40,215 --> 00:00:42,596
There's a free table. - Hello! - Hi!

18
00:00:49,024 --> 00:00:54,201
Oh, Miriam! We'd like to have two No Limits special breakfasts.

19
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:56,220
It includes everything you could wish for.

20
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,865
Frederic!

21
00:00:57,865 --> 00:00:59,085
What are you doing here?

22
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:03,056
Err.. working!

23
00:01:03,055 --> 00:01:04,480
And you?

24
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,893
You two know each other? That's funny, where from?

25
00:01:06,894 --> 00:01:08,765
Well, funny?

26
00:01:10,424 --> 00:01:11,622
Is something wrong?

27
00:01:11,623 --> 00:01:13,665
Good question! Is something wrong?

28
00:01:13,665 --> 00:01:14,531
Miriam, please, it's...

29
00:01:14,531 --> 00:01:15,526
How's Yvette doing?

30
00:01:16,332 --> 00:01:18,600
That's his wife.

31
00:01:22,075 --> 00:01:24,040
I can explain everything to you. Please, calm down!

32
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,384
I don't want to calm down! And I don't want to hear any explanations!

33
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,491
I didn't mean to hurt you.

34
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,716
But rather just have some fun, I get it!

35
00:01:34,436 --> 00:01:36,412
Well you've had your fun, now leave!

36
00:01:44,412 --> 00:01:45,727
Rebecca, I ...

37
00:01:47,662 --> 00:01:49,453
... I'm sorry!

38
00:01:55,242 --> 00:01:58,348
Hey, the guy isn't worth it.

39
00:01:59,516 --> 00:02:03,867
I really thought this could be something serious for a change.

40
00:02:03,867 --> 00:02:07,069
Yeah, he knows how to give you that feeling.

41
00:02:07,871 --> 00:02:09,651
Did he... with you?

42
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:10,662
Oh God, no!

43
00:02:10,662 --> 00:02:13,359
I went to school with his wife.

44
00:02:13,359 --> 00:02:16,500
And this is not the first time I've heard something like this about him.

45
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:19,772
Why do I have such bad luck with men?

46
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,439
You're not the only one.

47
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,905
I mean, ever since my boyfriend and I broke up...

48
00:02:25,793 --> 00:02:27,712
Oh, forget about it!

49
00:02:29,243 --> 00:02:32,050
But you know what? It's not our fault!

50
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,828
The state of the market is somewhat less than perfect.

51
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,568
But that'll change at some point.

52
00:02:40,525 --> 00:02:41,709
Sure.

53
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:43,670
Well, I firmly believe in it.

54
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:46,329
And until then, we'll just look at the bright side.

55
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:50,914
I mean, you've surely had fun last night, right?

56
00:02:53,915 --> 00:02:55,347
You see!

57
00:02:55,348 --> 00:02:58,940
Who says that only men are allowed to enjoy these kind of nights?
