1
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,800
玛瑟拉
Messala.

2
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,480
玛瑟拉！
Messala!

3
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,240
玛瑟拉
Messala.

4
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,640
玛瑟拉？
Messala?

5
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,760
我赢了吗
Did l win?

6
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,360
没有  你差点没害死自己
来吧
No, but you nearly killed yourself trying to.
Come on.

7
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,800
-还有别的方法可以分出伯仲吗
-去问母亲大人吧
-ls there any other way to race?
-Tell that to my mother.

8
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,160
一  二  三
One, two, three!

9
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,200
真应该在身后拉一群奴隶
l should have a line of slaves behind me.

10
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,720
最该有个奴隶来提醒你
你本凡人  而非天神
And one beside you, whispering in your ear
that you're a man, not a god.

11
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,320
这才是罗马精神  对吧  奥克塔维斯・玛瑟拉
ls that not the Roman way,
Octavius Messala?

12
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,960
-另一辆马车怎么啦？
-有一段路颠簸不平  所以翻了
-What happened to the other cart?
-We went over some rough ground.

13
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,040
-它们可不是比赛用的战车
-我警告过他了
-They're not racing chariots, you know?
-l told him that.

14
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,880
我们会修好的  母亲大人  我保证
We'll repair it, Mother. l promise.

15
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:16,720
你们两个今天去哪里了
为何没带我一起去
Where have you two been all day?
Why didn't you take me with you?

16
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,640
因为你乳臭未干  不适合与年轻壮士为伍
Because you are child
and not proper company for young men.

17
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,560
使劲搔她的痒  玛瑟拉
Tickle her severely, Messala.

18
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,280
尤达
Judah.

19
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:37,600
有个从卫戍部队来的信使  送来了这个
是给玛瑟拉的
A messenger from the Garrison
delivered this. It's for Messala.

20
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,760
我们都知道它迟早会来
We always knew this would come.

21
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,240
可自他母亲过世算起  已经五年多了
But it's been five years, more,
since his mother died.

22
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,080
难道你希望他父亲当时就把他带走吗
Would you prefer his father
had sent for him immediately?

23
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,160
-蒂莎会伤心欲绝的
-谁都高兴不起来  尤达
-Tirzah will be most unhappy.
-None of us will be happy, Judah.

24
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,320
另外  西蒙尼特斯已经到了
And Simonides has arrived.

25
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,640
见他之前  你必须换件衣服
You must change your clothes
before you greet him.

26
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:01,720
遵命  我都忘了他要来
Yes, l forgot he was coming.

27
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,600
很抱歉  他来时应由我接待的
l'm sorry.
l should have been here to meet him.

28
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,520
没错
Yes.

29
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:10,400
你的确该担负起应有的责任了
lt's time for you
to take up your responsibilities,

30
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,400
玛瑟拉也一样
and for Messala to face his.

31
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:17,320
无忧无虑的童年到此为止了
Childhood only lasts so long.

32
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,640
这么说  我们的童年要在同一天终结了
So our childhoods end on the same day,
his and mine.

33
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,000
而后我们就会分道扬镳
And our lives go in different directions.

34
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:29,960
虽然分道扬镳  却是殊途同归  成为真正的男儿
Different directions,
but the same journey to manhood

35
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,920
and all its rewards and responsibilities.

36
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,760
And l know that you will meet
whatever lies ahead

37
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,200
with a good heart and a brave spirit,

38
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:44,720
for you are your father's son.

39
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:48,240
And my mother's.

40
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:53,200
No mother was ever more blessed in a child.

41
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,160
去吧  尤达  告诉他  游戏时间结束了
Go now, Judah,
and tell your friend playtime's over.

42
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,800
看来只能如此了
So it would seem.

43
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,400
-究竟有何诀窍
-只需事先准备好即可
-What's the secret?
-You just have to be ready.

44
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,480
谁写来的
Who is it from?

45
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,720
我那位显赫的父亲 元老院议员马赛勒斯・阿葛瑞帕
From my illustrious father,
Senator Marcellus Agrippa.

46
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,120
你读吧
You read it.

47
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,440
这是私人信件  玛瑟拉
lt's a private letter, Messala.

48
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:38,800
我们关系这么好  没有什么不妥
l don't think you'll be embarrassed
by too many intimacies.

49
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,200
记住  诀窍就在于随时估计它的走向
Remember, the secret is to expect it to fall
every single moment.

50
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,040
"致奥克塔维斯・玛瑟拉
''To Octavius Messala.

51
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,760
将有一支军队护送你离开耶路撒冷  前往凯撒利亚  
''You will leave Jerusalem
with the next military convoy to Caesarea

52
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:53,880
那里已安排好你回罗马所需的交通工具"
''where transportation has been arranged
for your journey to Rome.''

53
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:59,680
-就这些吗
-他是个少言寡语的人  马赛勒斯・阿葛瑞帕
-ls that all?
-He's a man of few words, Marcellus Agrippa.

54
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:13,520
我有时真嫉妒你父亲已不在人世
l sometimes envy you having a dead father.

55
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,760
-尤达  见到你真是太好了
-很抱歉当时没有亲自接待您
-Judah, how good to see you.
-Forgive me for not being here to meet you.

56
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,760
-没关系  身体可还安康
-当然  劳您关心
-lt is of no matter. You are well?
-Yes, yes, thank you.

57
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:43,560
您呢  一路车马劳顿  是否疲累
And you? Your iourney was not too tiring?

58
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:46,480
从安提俄克到这里的路程依旧遥远
The distance from Antioch
does not grow shorter,

59
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,200
而我也依旧苍老
and l do not grow younger.

60
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,240
尤达  你应该知道  你已故的父亲
Judah, l think that you know
that your father, of blessed memory,

61
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,320
希望我们两个家族的关系可以不仅局限于商业伙伴
hoped that one day we would unite
our families in more than mercantile matters.

62
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,080
The painter does my daughter no iustice.

63
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,200
Esther is not simply a face,
but a mind and a spirit of rare quality.

64
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,840
l hope your father's and my aspirations
will be fulfilled.

65
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,960
Yes, yes.

66
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,960
lt has to be your wish also.

67
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:27,920
-And Esther's?
-Of course. Of course.

68
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,800
Thank you.

69
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:33,760
No, no.
It is for you until you meet in person.

70
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:51,720
-Come with me.
-Would if l could.

71
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,160
Where you are going
is the centre of the world, Messala.

72
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,480
Things that would never be possible here
will come your way.

73
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,760
Will you write to us?

74
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,600
l doubt it. l am no hand with a pen.

75
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,280
But l'll think of you, all of you.
And l'll miss you.

76
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,680
-And l will come back.
-Promise?

77
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,480
You be safe, Octavius Messala.

78
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,800
-We will race again.
-God willing.

79
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:50,840
Forward march!
Left, right. Left, right. Left, right, left.

80
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,480
Left, right. Left, right. Left, right, left.

81
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,560
Judah! Judah!

82
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,680
-This came for you.
-Messala is here.

83
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:30,960
-Open it.
-What does it say?

84
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,120
''Judah Ben Hur
is ordered to present himself

85
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,800
''to the Garrison Commander
upon receipt of this notice.''

86
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:54,320
Well, it's to the point.

87
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,040
-Probably written by a scribe.
-lt certainly wasn't written by a friend.

88
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,840
Well, you better not keep
the Garrison Commander waiting.

89
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:25,880
Halt.

90
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,760
l see you forgot nothing l taught you.

91
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:22,360
You know what the emperor Octavius
said of Rome?

92
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,000
He said, ''l found this city built of bricks,
and l left it made of marble.''

93
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,960
That is what l intend to say of Jerusalem.

94
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:32,360
That is a remarkable aspiration
for a garrison commander.

95
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,040
l won't always be a garrison commander

96
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,160
any more than Pontius Pilate
will always be the Governor of Judaea.

97
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,280
We could do great things here
together, you and l.

98
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,400
Marcellus Agrippa's got plans for me.

99
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,840
He spent a great deal of money
and influence advancing my career.

100
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:51,080
-Only shows his regard for you as his son.
-No.

101
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:52,560
No, it's his regard for his own future.

102
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,240
He wants a strong man on his side,
someone with military renown to his name.

103
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,920
Yes. And he's chosen you, Messala.

104
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
No, not quite.
l mean, he still hasn't given me his name.

105
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,320
l am still his unacknowledged bastard.

106
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:05,920
Begotten of a mistress he abandoned
when he found someone younger.

107
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,960
No. My father, the senator,
is a cruel, cunning, capricious man,

108
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,600
and those are some of his better qualities.

109
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:18,120
He's given me this chance,
which l am determined to take.

110
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:23,640
The trouble is it's earned me the enmity
of Pontius Pilate.

111
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,920
So l must tread carefully.
You can be of help to me, Judah.

112
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,800
Of course, in whatever way l can.

113
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:33,480
This festival of the Passover.

114
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:36,920
Now should you know of any elements
that plan to disrupt Pilate's arrival,

115
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,920
l'd want to know of them.

116
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
lt would reflect badly on me,
you understand?

117
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:46,280
Are you asking me
to become an informer, Messala?

118
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,520
l'm asking you to help preserve the order
of a Roman province.

119
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,960
This is my career, Judah.

120
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:54,160
l can't afford mistakes.
Not now, not at the start.

121
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,880
Pilate, he'd have me removed or demoted,
given a chance.

122
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,960
All l'm asking, between friends,

123
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:03,600
is if you know, or hear, or suspect anything,
just let me know.

124
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:10,480
Believe me, it saves much worse
if such things can be nipped in the bud.

125
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,160
Speaking of nipping in the bud,
which of these do you prefer?

126
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,480
l give you first choice.
l'm nothing if not a generous friend.

127
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:22,440
lf you will excuse me.

128
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:28,160
Shouldn't have thought you suffer
from the Greek affliction.

129
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,000
Judah, when may l pay my respects
to your mother?

130
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,160
-She's well l hope?
-She is.

131
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,680
She's looking forward to seeing you.

132
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:39,680
And Tirzah, she must be married by now
at her ripe age?

133
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:45,520
No. Tirzah has set her standards so high
that none of her suitors can meet them.

134
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,920
So there is hope for me yet.

135
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,440
Come and eat with us.

136
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:55,240
lt's good to see you, Judah.

137
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,080
We'll do great things here, you and l.

138
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:02,000
A great thing has already come to pass.

139
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,480
You are here with us again.

140
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:15,480
Hey! Let's hurry up. Get a move on.

141
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,920
He's a surly bugger,
that foreman of yours, Judah.

142
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,240
-Saves me from having to be one.
-Yes.

143
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,680
Well, that's what l'll be doing
under the new Garrison Commander.

144
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:26,880
What do you mean?

145
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,320
l'm being forced to step down a rank
for some child.

146
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,400
Well, he must the qualifications,
or he wouldn't have been given the post.

147
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,760
lt's not what you know. It's who you know.

148
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:41,080
The Governor's none too pleased.
He wanted to make me permanent.

149
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:43,720
Mind you,
l wouldn't trust Pilate's judgement either.

150
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,800
lt's all politics with these buggers.

151
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:49,080
-That's it then, David.
-All done.

152
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:53,640
-You intend to enter the chariot race, Gaius?
-ls there any other reason to live, Judah?

153
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:58,640
You'll be safe laying a talent on me.

154
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,800
lt wouldn't do for a Jew to wager
against his own team, now would it?

155
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:05,040
Suit yourself,
but you'll be throwing your money away.

156
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,480
Shalom!

157
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,720
You see? Didn't even count them.

158
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:12,400
We've already done that, haven't we?

159
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,360
Never hurts to rob those bastards
when you get a chance.

160
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,280
When you have a business
of your own, David,

161
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,880
you'll find out how well it pays
to cheat your customers.

162
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,880
Romans are not customers.
They're bloody conquerors.

163
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,400
Sometimes l think you forget that.

164
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,080
You know, l appreciate your animosity,
David. Your brother suffered at their hands.

165
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:32,960
Suffered?
Nailed up on a stick is how he suffered.

166
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:36,360
-Three days it took.
-He killed a Roman soldier, did he not?

167
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,400
Whose side are you on, Judah Ben Hur?

168
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,120
lt is not a question of sides.
We are under Roman occupation.

169
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,440
-Now that may be unfortunate, but it's a fact.
-Well, we'll see about that.

170
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,760
You know, a time is coming when
you'll be asked to say where you stand.

171
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,760
-Are you threatening me?
-No.

172
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,360
l'm iust telling you how it is.

173
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,240
You'll see what happens
when the Governor shows up at Passover.

174
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,920
Don't involve me in your conspiracies,
David. You know my position.

175
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,720
Pay your taxes and collaborate.

176
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,800
You know, you have a way with an argument
that turns into a quarrel.

177
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,160
l wondered when you'd be back.

178
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,320
You know, we have Simonides arriving,
bringing you your bride.

179
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:34,040
That is not funny.

180
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,280
You know there has been no understanding
between Esther and myself.

181
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,840
That's not what Simonides thinks.

182
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:44,080
Anyway, it's about time you were married.
Give us an heir apparent.

183
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,480
David Ben Levi was at me again today.

184
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:50,880
Why don't you get rid of that man?
He's a zealot.

185
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,840
No, Tirzah, he's an excellent overseer,

186
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:57,240
and he knows the business
as well or better than l.

187
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,320
l will not dismiss him for convictions
he holds as genuinely as l do my own.

188
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:04,960
Do you never get tired of being
so reasonable and even-handed, Judah?

189
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,640
People like David Ben Levi are dangerous.

190
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,320
They make life impossible for people like us.

191
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:15,240
You know, he as much as told me

192
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,920
there would be a demonstration
against the Governor at Passover.

193
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,040
-Well, then denounce him.
-You forget yourself, Sister.

194
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:27,240
We do not denounce our fellow countrymen.

195
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,920
There'll be solders everywhere.

196
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,640
You start something,
and there will be a massacre.

197
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,920
We should take note
of those who welcome him.

198
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,040
Put them on the list.

199
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:43,640
We must be prepared
to take advantage of any situation.

200
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,200
All of us should be armed
so we may strike a blow.

201
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:01,920
Leave us.

202
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,440
-So, you came.
-To warn you.

203
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:17,440
Judah, we are already warned.

204
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:19,840
Every day we see our enemy.
We know who they are.

205
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,480
The new Garrison Commander is determined

206
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:24,280
that nothing interfere
with the arrival of Pontius Pilate.

207
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:28,000
He will be on the alert,
and he will take action,

208
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:31,160
drastic action,
in the event of any disturbance.

209
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,800
You think this is news to us?

210
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,800
l know this Garrison Commander,

211
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,800
and he will not risk his reputation
on such an occasion.

212
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,880
-You know him?
-Octavius Messala is my friend.

213
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,520
That friend, you don't want anything
to spoil his big day.

214
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:51,200
l don't want to see any more men crucified
or sent to the galleys.

215
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:56,720
Very well, you've done your part.
You've warned us.

216
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,440
Now can l have your word
you will not betray us?

217
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,800
Were that in my mind, it would have been
a Roman who knocked at your door.

218
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,880
He must have changed to speak
in such a way to you, his best friend.

219
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,640
Of course he has changed, Tirzah.
He is a man, a soldier. He has been to war.

220
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:09,520
But he never forgot us. That much l know.
And he is glad to be back.

221
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:14,400
-What of his father? Did he speak of him?
-Not with any great affection, l'm afraid.

222
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,440
He referred to him always
as Marcellus Agrippa or the senator.

223
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:21,120
Poor boy.

224
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,520
And when can we expect an audience
with the poor boy?

225
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:27,160
He will dine with us in a few days.

226
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,320
And l hope you will manage
a more welcoming manner, Sister.

227
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,000
l have not invited him under our roof
to have him mocked.

228
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:36,920
You will see for yourself
how much he has changed

229
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,680
and how much he is still the same Messala
we knew and loved.

230
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:43,640
For we did love him, did we not?

231
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,840
-Yes. Yes, we did.
-Yes.

232
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,720
And we shall again.

233
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,480
-Judah!
-Here they are at last.

234
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:54,760
Greetings and welcome.

235
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,000
Let me present my daughter.

236
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:08,520
Esther.

237
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,560
Welcome, Esther, daughter of Simonides.

238
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:23,200
lt is my honour and my family's.

239
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:28,840
Welcome.

240
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,040
l saw her face, Judah.

241
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:40,240
-Saw what?
-That she was not disappointed.

242
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:56,520
l do not like to see birds kept captive,

243
00:22:56,599 --> 00:23:00,440
but my father says they are never free
of the chains of the sky.

244
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:01,720
lndeed.

245
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,960
You need not approve
my father's nonsense, Judah.

246
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,480
Do you really think these creatures
would not wish to fly away at this moment

247
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,240
-if l opened their cage?
-Perhaps.

248
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:17,120
Although they might not survive for long.

249
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,120
lf l were they,
l should wish to have the choice.

250
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,040
How happy l am to see Jerusalem at last.

251
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,240
To you it is a familiar sight, l know.

252
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:33,400
But l, too, often stand here
and admire this view.

253
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,920
lt is the city of our faith,
and while we have it,

254
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,360
we have our centre, our heart.

255
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:45,800
Forgive me. l have a tendency to pontificate.
l do not mean to...

256
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,480
No, no, go on. Please, continue.

257
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:58,560
Esther, l realise your father has
certain expectations

258
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,880
as did my father,

259
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,760
and you should know that
l am not opposed to their wishes.

260
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:11,320
But you think we should make
our own choice in a matter so important?

261
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:16,120
As you say.

262
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,280
Be you betrothed to me with this, my wealth.

263
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,000
For the first couple of years l was in Rome,
l didn't even see Marcellus Agrippa.

264
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:23,680
lt was all military training.

265
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:26,120
Poor Messala, learning how to be a soldier.

266
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,480
lt has its compensations.
The ladies of Rome are very patriotic.

267
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,080
Did you teach them to catch the stick?

268
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,880
Your father must be so proud of you.

269
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,960
No. l wouldn't go so far as to say that.

270
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,640
He's expectant, maybe, but...

271
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,760
l'm not ungrateful.

272
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:47,240
He has given me so much advice,
advice which has stood the test of reality.

273
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:51,760
''He over whom you have no power
has power over you.'' That's his motto.

274
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:54,840
Power, he says,
is the only currency worth hoarding.

275
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,960
lt never loses its value.

276
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,680
But there are powers other
than those Marcellus Agrippa speaks of.

277
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:05,360
Of faith, of family, of friends, fair dealing.

278
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,680
ln Rome, no such powers prevail.

279
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:11,920
Even Tiberius, our emperor, gave up
his beloved wife and his three children

280
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,600
to make a dynastic marriage
with his brother's widow.

281
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,160
Everyone applauded his wisdom.

282
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,880
l think that not wisdom
but an affront against God.

283
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,480
Whose god? Yours?

284
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:26,560
Rome and its values are not for you, Esther,
nor my friend, your husband-to-be.

285
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,800
But they're for those whose ambitions
remain unchecked by conscience,

286
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,880
whose loyalty can be purchased
by advancement and coin.

287
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,440
And have you become such a one, Messala?

288
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,240
l have.

289
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,760
l mean, l think l have.

290
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:47,680
But such is my fate.

291
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:50,440
We are all in the hands of the gods,
are we not?

292
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:52,760
Such is our belief.

293
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,320
So have you given any thought
to what l said earlier?

294
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,440
Regarding provocations, disturbances
and so forth?

295
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,160
lt is as l have told you.

296
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,600
l will have no hand in any demonstration
against Rome.

297
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,000
l know.

298
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,440
l talk of hearsay, rumour.

299
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,280
Nothing?

300
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:20,440
-Why do you question your friend's word?
-He hasn't given me his word. Have you?

301
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:22,400
ls it so much to ask assurance of a friend?

302
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,240
Come, you need only ask Gaius Antonius

303
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:27,400
to know that the Hur family
have always cooperated with Rome.

304
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,880
l'm asking Judah.

305
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,560
lt does Rome no credit to impugn a friend
under his own roof

306
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,960
while in receipt of hospitality.

307
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:36,400
l impugn no one. l do as my duty requires.

308
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,280
ls it so much to ask for Judah's word?

309
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,520
-l give you my word.
-Thank you.

310
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:47,240
Shame on you, Octavius Messala,
to speak so to those who love you.

311
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:52,040
Daughter, Messala is a guest and our friend.

312
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:55,400
-Apologise to him.
-No.

313
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,160
l should apologise. l spoke out of turn.

314
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:06,960
Thank you, Judah.
It's of great comfort to me.

315
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:14,760
To all our futures. May they be happy
and prosperous, however brief.

316
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,040
She's got a mind of her own, Esther.
You should have a care, Judah.

317
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:28,560
When she takes the reins,
she'll ride you hard.

318
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,240
And your sister.

319
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,720
You should know l've contrived

320
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,760
to have Pilate's procession pass here
in front of the house

321
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:42,880
so you'll have the chance to see me
in all my pomp.

322
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,960
l'll be the handsome one on the white horse.

323
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,280
Forgive me.

324
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,800
You know, half my performance
is to convince myself.

325
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,120
Messala, no need of forgiveness.

326
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,000
Go with God and be yourself tomorrow.

327
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:20,680
All will be well.

328
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,280
Forward!

329
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:27,680
March. Left, right. Left, right.

330
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:30,240
Left. Left. Left.

331
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:34,400
Have a care, Judah.
He could be a dangerous enemy.

332
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,200
And a more dangerous friend.

333
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:12,360
At the first sign of any trouble,
any demonstration from the crowd, quell it.

334
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,320
Use the butt end to begin with,

335
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:19,440
but if that proves unavailing,
give them the blade. Is that understood?

336
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:21,080
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

337
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,800
We should be bringing Pilate
to the Garrison direct.

338
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,640
Keep him on the main streets.
We'll have clear space on either side.

339
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,080
The lower city is too narrow.

340
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:36,120
You make it seem as if l were
sneaking Pilate through the back door.

341
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,840
l don't think he'd appreciate
the caution, Gaius.

342
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,560
l think he might find it
an affront to his vanity.

343
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,240
Your iob is to protect, not to flatter.

344
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:46,840
There speaks a voice
with no concern for politics.

345
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,200
And who thanks the gods for it.

346
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,120
Go home, Romans.

347
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,760
-Keep on riding.
-Go back where you came from.

348
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:16,280
Have respect, Romans.

349
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:18,760
You have no respect.

350
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,040
A sullen lot, these Jews.

351
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:37,800
Better to be obeyed
than beloved, Excellency.

352
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,640
Drop back a length.

353
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:51,680
Go home, Romans.

354
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:53,800
Have some shame, Romans.

355
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:34,760
Go on.

356
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:39,320
There's Pilate at the front,
gleaming like a brass pot.

357
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:44,360
Messala does look splendid, l must say.

358
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,120
Look out!

359
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,480
Do something.

360
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,520
Seize him!

361
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,080
Seize him!

362
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,960
Arrest Judah.

363
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,320
Move!

364
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,640
lt was an accident. A tile fell from...

365
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,160
lt was an accident. Please!
It was an accident!

366
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:27,520
-Judah.
-Tirzah.

367
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,280
lt was an accident! Judah!

368
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,760
ln broad daylight,
an attack on Rome's emissary.

369
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:42,080
Tiberius will hear of this and of
your incompetence, you place-bought fool!

370
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:46,880
l will have you removed, you hear?
Sent to the furthest reaches of the Empire!

371
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,040
Am l not iniured enough?

372
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:51,920
l could have been killed.

373
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,120
Those responsible are under arrest,
Excellency.

374
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:57,600
Crucify them!
The weapon could have pierced my skull.

375
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:00,840
Well, what are you waiting for?
l said crucify them.

376
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:07,480
-Excellency, it is the feast of the Passover.
-l know that!

377
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:11,280
That's why l am here
to make Rome's presence felt.

378
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:14,240
Who are these rebels?

379
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,760
One of the foremost
of the Jewish families in Jerusalem.

380
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,520
Judah Ben Hur and his mother and sister.

381
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:21,280
Well, make an example of them.
Crucify the man and garrotte the women.

382
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:31,080
Do you hear me?

383
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:25,280
Thank God. Are my mother and Tirzah safe?

384
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,640
You have more to concern you
than their welfare.

385
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:32,160
You attempted to kill his Excellency,
Pontius Pilate.

386
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:37,280
Messala, it was an accident.
A tile fell from the roof.

387
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,880
When the governor of a Roman province
is attacked in the street,

388
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,240
it is not an accident.
It is a rebellion against Rome.

389
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,440
Have you gone mad?

390
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:47,640
-You gave a signal for the riot to begin.
-You cannot believe that.

391
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:54,640
-My family and l are your friends.
-You and your family have destroyed me!

392
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:56,480
Do you understand that?

393
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:00,000
Messala, l knew nothing.

394
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,240
Liar! You lied last night.
l saw it in your eyes.

395
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,560
Admit it.

396
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:13,920
Give me the names of the other plotters,
the ones you signalled, you and your family!

397
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,680
Don't threaten my family.

398
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,200
They are even more blameless than l.

399
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:24,480
Let me go before Pilate and explain.

400
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:27,000
He wants you crucified,

401
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:31,320
and your mother and sister
to be executed by strangulation.

402
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:34,440
-No! No!
-Hear me, Judah.

403
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:37,160
You have destroyed the house of Hur
and me with it.

404
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:40,760
-Messala, listen to me.
-No, you listen to me.

405
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,760
Where there is a war, someone must go to it,

406
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:47,000
and it will not be me.

407
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:53,760
Messala! Messala! Messala!

408
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,360
These two are going to get the wire.

409
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,200
Be assured my report will make clear
that it was your incompetence

410
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,400
that led to this insult to the Emperor.

411
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,160
-Excellency...
-Silence!

412
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:26,000
l'm dismissing you as Garrison Commander
and reinstating Gaius Antonius.

413
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,320
And trust me, your patron, Senator Agrippa,
will not intervene this time

414
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,040
to keep you in a post
for which you are manifestly unfit.

415
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,800
Get up! Up, come on. l said get up!

416
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,200
All right, get out of here, you.

417
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:21,720
Forgive them,
for they know not what they do.

418
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:27,280
for they know not what they do.
forgve them.

419
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:54,840
Simonides! Simonides! Simonides!

420
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,800
Am l not to be crucified?

421
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:07,040
No such luck.
Your sentence has been changed.

422
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,360
You're for the galleys.

423
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,520
A year from now, you'll be wishing
they'd put you up on a stick.

424
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:34,120
You are now under the command
of Quintus Arrius,

425
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:36,560
commander of the Southern Fleet

426
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:41,000
and victor
of the Battle of the Corinth Straits.

427
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:45,960
You have been chosen
to carry His Excellency

428
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:48,800
to receive reward for his service

429
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,400
from the hand
of the Emperor Tiberius himself.

430
00:41:54,559 --> 00:42:00,280
You may consider yourselves honoured
and will acquit your duty accordingly,

431
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,720
or by the gods, you will answer to me.

432
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:06,520
Honoured, do you hear?

433
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:11,160
Silence! Silence at the oars.

434
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:18,600
Let every man know that any infraction
will be severely dealt with.

435
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:21,600
Severely dealt with iust for a change.

436
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:24,720
Prepare to increase.

437
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:31,600
And stroke. And stroke. And stroke.

438
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,720
Quintus Arrius.

439
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,880
He is the one who cleaned out the pirates,

440
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:48,040
and honoured we are
to be rowing him to Rome.

441
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,160
You feeling honoured, Number 40?

442
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,840
They killed my wife,

443
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:02,280
and my daughter, and my son.

444
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:07,160
They create a wilderness and call it peace.

445
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:11,240
Every night l dream, my friend.

446
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:17,160
Then l wake up, but l'm still Number 41.

447
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:24,400
Do you ever think maybe it's all a bad dream,

448
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,680
and death is when you wake from it?

449
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:30,440
Go to sleep, Antegua.

450
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:37,360
Dream of killing Romans and kill one for me,
Number 40.

451
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:17,280
They have two anklets. Is one not enough?

452
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,080
l switch the rowers from port to starboard
on a regular basis, Excellency.

453
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:24,080
lt keeps them better balanced.
It requires being able to chain them

454
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:26,760
to battle stations
whichever side they are rowing.

455
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,000
And does the result outweigh the cost
for the extra anklets?

456
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,400
Yes, sir, they are better oarsmen for it.

457
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,040
Well, commendations, Hortator.

458
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,320
Thank you, Excellency.

459
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,160
He did not tell you it was Number 40's idea.

460
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,880
Silence at the oars!

461
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,600
-Whose idea was it, Number 41?
-Number 40's.

462
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:57,800
ls this true, Number 40?

463
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:01,640
Would Number 41 lie to Quintus Arrius?

464
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:05,160
He mentioned it to me, Excellency.

465
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:11,520
And you took the advice of a galley slave?

466
00:45:13,639 --> 00:45:17,480
Congratulations on having an open mind.

467
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:39,240
The thing of it is,

468
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,480
l am not afraid of death.

469
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:47,160
Either it will be better than this,
or it will be nothing,

470
00:45:47,239 --> 00:45:49,520
which will be better than this.

471
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:52,960
What are you afraid of?

472
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,280
Nothing.

473
00:45:56,159 --> 00:45:59,080
l am afraid of going down in the chains.

474
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,400
On your feet.

475
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,720
We're only iust off the oars.

476
00:46:13,719 --> 00:46:15,640
You're wanted up top.

477
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,280
You're going to see His Excellency.

478
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,520
You mind your mouth in there.

479
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:41,080
l don't want any of your smart opinions
about how to run a galley.

480
00:46:41,159 --> 00:46:42,760
ls that clear?

481
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:46,200
Come on.

482
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,160
-Pull them out.
-Pull out! Pull it.

483
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:54,600
Watch the side.

484
00:46:54,679 --> 00:46:56,360
Right ship, turn!

485
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,080
Come.

486
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:07,080
Number 40, Excellency.

487
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:17,440
l don't suppose you know much
about naval strategy, do you, Number 40?

488
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:19,480
Mine is not the best place to learn.

489
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:23,080
Then why would you suggest the hortator
switch the rowers from side to side?

490
00:47:23,159 --> 00:47:24,680
l believe he explained the reason.

491
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,920
The rowers would be better balanced.
Yes, he did.

492
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,280
But why would you care?

493
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:34,120
Efficiency is better than it's opposite,
even for a galley slave.

494
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,720
How long have you been at the oars?

495
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,920
Almost three years.

496
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,360
Well, you are certainly thriving on it.

497
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,880
How long did you get?

498
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,880
There was no limit put on my sentence.

499
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:00,600
And what did you do to deserve that?

500
00:48:00,679 --> 00:48:03,360
l was betrayed by a friend.

501
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,040
Well, that usually carries
a maximum penalty.

502
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:23,480
Are you going to tell me now
that you are entirely innocent?

503
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:25,960
Well, if we lived in Rome
it wouldn't be worth comment,

504
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:29,080
so commonplace it would be.

505
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:31,200
That is little consolation

506
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,520
when you have been wrongfully accused
and convicted without a hearing,

507
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:39,040
your family destroyed, and all on the word
of one who was your friend.

508
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:42,240
Well, l'm surprised

509
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:46,000
that a man with your education
and intelligence has lasted so long.

510
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,960
This work is for unthinking brutes.

511
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:52,280
l've had encouragement in that direction.

512
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:57,720
Come. Come.

513
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:04,440
Sir. Three ships sighted.
Just put out from the headland.

514
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:05,800
They are pirates for sure.

515
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,240
They have the land breeze,
but they're no match for our rowers.

516
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,240
We can outrun them.

517
00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:14,760
Outrun? No, no, no, no.

518
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:18,320
Outmanoeuvre, outthink, outfight,
but not outrun.

519
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,360
ln case the news gets back to Rome,
and it's converted to running away.

520
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,000
Quintus Arrius does not run away.

521
00:49:26,199 --> 00:49:29,800
Off you go, Number 40, and take the grapes.

522
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,680
lt will sweeten your stroke.

523
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,200
What is that?

524
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,040
Trumpet calling us to battle stations.

525
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:23,240
l was dreaming
l was in a garden drinking sherbet.

526
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,280
l can taste it.

527
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,240
Battle stations.

528
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,440
Three pirates came out to greet us.

529
00:50:33,519 --> 00:50:36,120
May they capture us and kill all the Romans.

530
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,320
May we kill those they leave behind.

531
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,160
We're going to port.

532
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,880
lt's your lucky day, isn't it, Number 40?

533
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,320
Battle stations!

534
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:14,800
Battle stations!

535
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:17,640
Oars out!

536
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:22,440
And stroke.

537
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:27,120
And stroke. And stroke.

538
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:29,000
Port! Hold!

539
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:34,720
Port, oars in! Hold!

540
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:37,720
Coming about.

541
00:51:41,719 --> 00:51:43,960
-Secure port.
-Hold steady!

542
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:50,360
Port, withdraw!

543
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,560
And stroke.

544
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:57,920
And stroke. And stroke.

545
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,320
And stroke.

546
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,120
And stroke.

547
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,680
And stroke. And stroke.

548
00:52:10,199 --> 00:52:13,960
And stroke. And stroke.

549
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,280
Give me speed!

550
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,840
Stroke. And stroke. And stroke.

551
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,600
Archers at the ready!

552
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:27,520
-Ready arrows.
-Hold formation.

553
00:52:28,039 --> 00:52:29,080
Hold your position.

554
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:33,680
Starboard in.

555
00:52:36,519 --> 00:52:37,840
Release!

556
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,320
Oars out!

557
00:52:48,679 --> 00:52:50,840
And stroke.

558
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:54,880
And stroke. And stroke.

559
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,000
Port, in!

560
00:53:04,039 --> 00:53:05,520
Hold!

561
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,520
How many?

562
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,480
Two more.

563
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:15,080
Port, withdraw!

564
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:19,640
And stroke, and stroke.

565
00:53:19,719 --> 00:53:21,480
And stroke.

566
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:27,400
Ramming speed!

567
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,560
Ramming speed!

568
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:31,600
And stroke.

569
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:35,160
And stroke. And stroke.

570
00:53:35,239 --> 00:53:37,120
And stroke.

571
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:47,400
And stroke. And stroke.

572
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:50,720
And stroke. And stroke.

573
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,560
Back oars. Back oars! Back oars!

574
00:54:30,159 --> 00:54:32,240
Judah, unlock the chains!

575
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,520
The chains!

576
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,520
The chains!

577
00:54:43,639 --> 00:54:44,800
Quickly, Judah.

578
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:53,080
Judah.

579
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:27,320
lt's no use.

580
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:30,400
Go, Number 40, and kill a Roman for me.

581
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,160
Don't let me drown in these chains.

582
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,600
You?

583
00:58:10,679 --> 00:58:12,920
Number 40.

584
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,440
Who else?

585
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:19,960
Are there other survivors?

586
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:22,280
There's been no sign.

587
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:26,120
This needs to come out.

588
00:58:26,199 --> 00:58:27,920
Not if it's barbed.

589
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,840
Try.

590
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,200
One good pull. It's an order, Number 40!

591
00:58:59,639 --> 00:59:01,520
lt's very clever.

592
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:05,440
Detach blade so it stays in the body.

593
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:16,560
The Great Quintus Arrius
adrift with a slave in his hour of triumph.

594
00:59:16,639 --> 00:59:17,840
You are still alive.

595
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,840
You mean l am not dead.
There's a difference.

596
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,880
l know the difference.

597
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:27,160
Well, the gods
have their own sense of humour.

598
00:59:27,239 --> 00:59:30,160
l trust you still believe in your god.

599
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:33,880
How can l say other
when l am delivered from my chains?

600
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,600
Not by a god.

601
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:39,440
Before each battle,

602
00:59:39,519 --> 00:59:41,960
l unchain one rower.

603
00:59:42,039 --> 00:59:44,280
Why?

604
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:49,240
Call it a reminder of humility,
an antidote to hubris,

605
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:52,880
or simply habit.

606
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,480
Why me?

607
00:59:57,039 --> 00:59:59,360
Maybe l like the way you eat grapes.

608
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,800
What?

609
01:00:28,239 --> 01:00:30,040
What is it?

610
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:31,280
A sail.

611
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,800
l will not be taken by pirates.

612
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,560
lf this is a pirate ship,
you must not let them take me.

613
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:48,160
So having saved your life, l should take it
to save you from the oars.

614
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:54,440
lf this is a Roman ship,
l will not let them take you back.

615
01:00:54,519 --> 01:00:59,240
You will come to Rome as my slave.
This is a better form of servitude.

616
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:02,560
You have my word on it, Number 40.

617
01:01:02,639 --> 01:01:05,760
My name is Judah Ben Hur.

618
01:01:08,119 --> 01:01:10,920
You have my word, Judah Ben Hur.

619
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:23,480
Hey! Hey! Hey!

620
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:27,960
Hey!

621
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:40,600
Their chieftain is here as you ordered.

622
01:01:40,679 --> 01:01:41,840
His family?

623
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,680
The women killed themselves.

624
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:47,920
He was only taken alive with great difficulty.
It cost us three men.

625
01:02:04,239 --> 01:02:05,680
Will we crucify him, sir?

626
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:08,600
No. Keep him alive.

627
01:02:08,679 --> 01:02:10,800
l have a better idea.

628
01:02:25,159 --> 01:02:28,440
My son will receive his reward
at the hands of Tiberius himself

629
01:02:28,519 --> 01:02:30,000
when he returns to Rome.

630
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,480
Such are his triumphs against the Thracians.

631
01:02:34,719 --> 01:02:38,280
Well, l am glad that your son
has finally made you proud.

632
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:41,440
You've waited a long time
for a return on your investment.

633
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:45,160
Bastards got on mistresses
need time to prove themselves.

634
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:50,120
And at least l will have a son
to carry on my name.

635
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:53,880
So, Marcellus,
you've seen fit to bestow it on him.

636
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:56,840
l need Tiberius' approval.

637
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:59,240
Well, you know how he likes
a man to die without heirs,

638
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:02,280
so that all his estates
are subject to his decree.

639
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:07,120
Well, let's pray he survives you
to carry on your illustrious name.

640
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:09,080
Quite so.

641
01:03:09,159 --> 01:03:11,240
l hope to prevail on Tiberius

642
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:14,560
to grant Octavius Messala
the governorship of Judaea.

643
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:17,800
Replace that wretch who did so much
to obstruct his advancement.

644
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,600
And Tiberius will grant this favour?

645
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:22,240
There are ways to influence an emperor.

646
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:24,120
My Thracian will take his fancy,

647
01:03:24,199 --> 01:03:27,640
and of course,
Athene can be most persuasive.

648
01:03:30,199 --> 01:03:31,600
Gods.

649
01:03:31,679 --> 01:03:33,760
l feel the need of a little intestinal relief.

650
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,200
Excuse me.

651
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:51,680
l can give you something to dull the pain.

652
01:03:55,079 --> 01:03:58,760
And how do you feel about
being on loan to our Emperor?

653
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:01,800
l am a whore. How should l feel?

654
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:24,960
So which is your
galley-slave-turned-gladiator?

655
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,680
The blond one.

656
01:04:29,159 --> 01:04:32,440
But he's no gladiator. He's my body servant.

657
01:04:38,679 --> 01:04:39,760
Skilled in arms.

658
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,920
What, does the victor
of the Corinth Straits fear assassination

659
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,720
that he must go guarded in the streets?

660
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,880
He's beautiful, your body servant.

661
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:53,240
lndeed.

662
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:54,760
You pick well, Quintus.

663
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:56,360
We chose each other.

664
01:04:58,719 --> 01:05:00,920
Chose each other, did we?

665
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:18,000
Enough! Enough!

666
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:20,280
You improve day by day.

667
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,640
A fine looking specimen.

668
01:05:27,719 --> 01:05:32,040
What say you match him
against my Thracian before the Emperor?

669
01:05:32,119 --> 01:05:33,520
There is no likelihood of that.

670
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:36,960
l value him too much
to see him butchered for your amusement.

671
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:38,760
l'll give you odds.

672
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:44,280
He's learning well, and he's learning fast.

673
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:46,120
-Could you have killed him?
-Today?

674
01:05:46,199 --> 01:05:48,480
Only about a half dozen times.

675
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,280
l am Athene.

676
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:15,680
Judah.

677
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:18,720
So you are a Jew, and l am a Greek.

678
01:06:20,199 --> 01:06:25,040
Both of us conquered peoples
subject to the will of Rome and Romans.

679
01:06:28,119 --> 01:06:31,720
We should make a common cause
while we have the chance.

680
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,320
lf you'll excuse me.

681
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:46,760
Did you...

682
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:50,200
The Greek, did she take you to her bed?

683
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,200
She's not to my taste.

684
01:06:55,480 --> 01:07:01,400
Judah, no...
Don't make me laugh. It hurts too much.

685
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,160
Go to her.

686
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:11,920
Are you asking me
to sleep with this woman?

687
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,160
No. l'm ordering you to.

688
01:07:17,079 --> 01:07:19,480
lt will not be such a hardship.

689
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:22,160
Why would you wish it?

690
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:25,960
Because Marcellus Agrippa wants it.

691
01:07:26,039 --> 01:07:28,120
Marcellus Agrippa?

692
01:07:28,199 --> 01:07:31,880
He uses her for his ends,
few of which are carnal.

693
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:37,040
She will inquire of things he wants to know.
Such as, what you are to me,

694
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:40,480
how long you think l will last,
and who are my heirs.

695
01:07:41,159 --> 01:07:42,760
Why does he want to know these things?

696
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:45,360
Because in Rome, knowledge is power.

697
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,800
And he over whom you do not have power
has power over you.

698
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:51,280
l see you've learned the ways
of the Imperium.

699
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:53,160
l had a good teacher.

700
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:58,880
Have your physicians no remedy
for your pain?

701
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:01,080
No, l have had my fill with them.

702
01:08:01,159 --> 01:08:03,120
When my time comes,
l will take the pink bath.

703
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:05,400
-The Roman way.
-Yes.

704
01:08:06,039 --> 01:08:10,040
Come, rest now. All will be well.

705
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:22,200
Judah, l will have you as my heir

706
01:08:22,279 --> 01:08:25,600
to have at your disposal my estates,
my name.

707
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:31,480
And to go with them, Roman citizenship

708
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:35,280
and a full pardon
for all charges held against you.

709
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:37,080
What of your kin?

710
01:08:37,159 --> 01:08:42,400
l have none, saving you now, Sextus Arrius.

711
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:49,600
Sextus was my son. He died many years ago
in a plague with his mother.

712
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:52,440
You do me honour to give me his name.

713
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:55,840
Then all l ask is you do not disgrace it.

714
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:59,080
No more than l would my own father's.

715
01:08:59,159 --> 01:09:01,840
Then we are both well pleased, my son.

716
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:04,280
Come.

717
01:09:12,159 --> 01:09:14,680
You know, l cannot rest
until l've had my revenge

718
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:17,280
upon he who killed my mother and sister.

719
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:19,160
Octavius Messala.

720
01:09:24,199 --> 01:09:27,800
Emperor, my sources report
that Pontius Pilate is inept,

721
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:31,480
incompetent, and corrupt, and that Judaea,
were it administered properly,

722
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:35,920
would contribute five times the sum
you presently receive from its taxes.

723
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,240
Octavius Messala
would assure these revenues.

724
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:47,200
lndeed, l will guarantee them in advance,
such is my confidence in his abilities.

725
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,960
l was never handsome.

726
01:09:55,039 --> 01:09:58,120
My mother said
l was her least favourite child.

727
01:10:00,319 --> 01:10:03,520
Do me iustice but no favours,
do you understand?

728
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:10,560
Tell me, Marcellus,
is this not the same Octavius Messala

729
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:14,240
who not four years ago was sent abroad
in disgrace by Pontius Pilate

730
01:10:14,319 --> 01:10:17,440
for conspicuous neglect of his duties?

731
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:20,080
A contrivance against him

732
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:23,760
so that Pilate could re-install
his own favourite.

733
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,280
Messala knows these Jews.

734
01:10:26,359 --> 01:10:29,040
He's lived amongst them.
He speaks their language,

735
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:31,920
knows their customs. He has assured me...

736
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,800
l will consider it.

737
01:10:35,159 --> 01:10:37,320
l could ask no more.

738
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:41,280
What's this l hear
about some gladiator you own?

739
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,040
Yes. My Thracian.

740
01:10:47,119 --> 01:10:49,600
Sent to me by Messala.

741
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:52,120
Already he has three kills to his credit.

742
01:10:52,199 --> 01:10:54,040
l shall like to see him in action.

743
01:10:54,119 --> 01:10:56,280
By your decree, Emperor.

744
01:10:56,359 --> 01:11:00,600
But l am having difficulty
in finding him opponents

745
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:03,400
or perhaps l should say victims.

746
01:11:03,479 --> 01:11:07,600
l challenged Quintus Arrius to put
his young protg?up against him,

747
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,840
but he prizes him too much.

748
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:13,640
l think perhaps there is more to that matter
than meets the eye.

749
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:16,080
There usually is.

750
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:20,240
But l doubt Quintus Arrius
uses bum boys as gladiators.

751
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:24,560
Well, we must find some way

752
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:28,960
of having your prodigy
entertain us at my next gathering.

753
01:11:29,039 --> 01:11:32,640
At the Emperor's command, it shall be done.

754
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:06,160
l didn't expect virginity along with virility.

755
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:10,240
But l am honoured to receive it.

756
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:20,000
You must allow me the privilege
of advancing your education.

757
01:12:20,079 --> 01:12:23,160
And why would you do that?

758
01:12:23,239 --> 01:12:27,440
l might teach you to pleasure me
as well as yourself.

759
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:33,240
And some day you might have a wife
who would appreciate such skills.

760
01:12:33,319 --> 01:12:38,560
And it would give you the time to find out
whatever Marcellus Agrippa bid you learn.

761
01:12:40,359 --> 01:12:43,480
You may tell me what you please or not.

762
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:46,680
But did not Quintus Arrius
bid you do the same?

763
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,840
We will not quarrel over this.

764
01:12:59,239 --> 01:13:00,920
Marcellus Agrippa.

765
01:13:02,199 --> 01:13:03,240
He has a son.

766
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:08,600
Octavius Messala. Do you know him?

767
01:13:10,439 --> 01:13:13,000
A great hero by all accounts.

768
01:13:13,079 --> 01:13:16,560
No doubt
l will have the chance to j'udge for myself.

769
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:29,240
l see l have your attention again.

770
01:13:34,039 --> 01:13:38,000
This time, keep in mind
that it is not a sprint.

771
01:13:55,319 --> 01:13:57,720
Look at this.

772
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:02,040
l would exchange it all
to be once more on the battlefield.

773
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:08,360
Did you not find it so, Quintus Arrius,
that war is so much simpler than life?

774
01:14:08,439 --> 01:14:11,160
But one cannot make war forever.

775
01:14:11,239 --> 01:14:14,040
There comes a time
when you have to put the sword down.

776
01:14:14,119 --> 01:14:16,640
Especially when you can't hold it.

777
01:14:21,399 --> 01:14:24,680
My dear Quintus, you look worse than l do.

778
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:29,160
Shall l send for my physician?
He has not killed me yet.

779
01:14:29,239 --> 01:14:33,240
No, l have made my own arrangements.
But l thank the Emperor.

780
01:14:35,359 --> 01:14:38,520
-Then what can l do?
-For me, nothing.

781
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:43,920
But l would have your approval
of my intention

782
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:49,520
to leave all l possess, including my name,
to someone of whom l have become fond.

783
01:14:50,199 --> 01:14:55,160
To whom, indeed, l owe my life,
what is left of it.

784
01:14:55,239 --> 01:14:57,640
This is your galley slave?

785
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:00,320
The one that Marcellus speaks of
as your catamite?

786
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:03,280
He is my companion, nothing more.

787
01:15:03,359 --> 01:15:05,240
My dear Quintus,

788
01:15:05,319 --> 01:15:09,200
you are at liberty to bequeath
your name, and its fame,

789
01:15:09,279 --> 01:15:11,440
and all you possess to whom you choose.

790
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:13,800
Your service to Rome and its laws
grant you that.

791
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:17,120
But in Rome, the supreme law is yours.

792
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:23,960
So how is it a galley slave
saves the life of an admiral?

793
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:26,720
By the will of the gods.

794
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:32,880
lndeed, we do amuse ourselves
in the most peculiar fashion sometimes.

795
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:38,800
Very well. If that is what you wish.

796
01:15:40,079 --> 01:15:42,680
But l must meet this fortunate young fellow.

797
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:45,920
Bring him to my next masque.

798
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,320
l am in your debt.

799
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:51,680
l may require you to acknowledge that
before you slip anchor.

800
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:54,160
l wouldn't delay your request long.

801
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:57,040
l wouldn't want to disappoint my Emperor.

802
01:16:03,079 --> 01:16:04,880
-May l...
-You may.

803
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:29,280
Emperor.

804
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:32,000
Emperor.

805
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:43,120
l have the honour
of presenting to you my son,

806
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:44,440
Sextus Arrius.

807
01:16:45,359 --> 01:16:48,880
Well, let me have a look at the paragon.

808
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,320
Take off your mask, Sextus.

809
01:16:57,439 --> 01:16:59,840
l hear you are no mean man at arms.

810
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:03,600
l am but an apprentice at the trade, Emperor.

811
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:07,800
Well, l hope to have some evidence
of your prowess.

812
01:17:12,119 --> 01:17:17,200
l would have your new-found heir
display his skills for us, Quintus Arrius.

813
01:17:17,279 --> 01:17:18,760
ln what manner?

814
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:21,200
Why, by combat.

815
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:24,400
l hadn't thought
that such a display would be necessary.

816
01:17:24,479 --> 01:17:27,560
Did l not say that you were in my debt,

817
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:32,320
and did you not tell me
l must make haste to have it repaid?

818
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:33,800
l am the Emperor's to command.

819
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,360
What of the Thracian of yours?

820
01:17:38,439 --> 01:17:40,680
At the Emperor's pleasure.

821
01:17:42,039 --> 01:17:44,760
Emperor, this was not my understanding.

822
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:48,800
There is no understanding but mine,
Quintus Arrius!

823
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:51,000
Replace your mask.

824
01:17:51,079 --> 01:17:54,960
You do not have my permission
to show your face!

825
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:29,440
Sword against spear,
the best of all the pairings.

826
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:32,200
ls it to your satisfaction?

827
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:35,600
lf they know how to use them.

828
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:39,040
l can assure you my Thracian does.

829
01:18:39,119 --> 01:18:40,880
And what about your Sextus?

830
01:19:37,119 --> 01:19:39,840
Emperor, Emperor, l beg you.

831
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:00,960
Kill him.

832
01:20:20,119 --> 01:20:22,360
Emperor!

833
01:20:22,439 --> 01:20:24,160
lt seems you were right.

834
01:20:24,279 --> 01:20:27,280
The gods amuse themselves
in a peculiar way.

835
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:35,680
Emperor. The man was mad. Emperor?

836
01:21:01,479 --> 01:21:05,720
Your god, he sets his hand
against self-slaughter, does he not?

837
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:16,200
lt is hard to tell with gods
whether they care about our ways,

838
01:21:16,279 --> 01:21:21,640
or whether, indeed,
they are anything but our fancies

839
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,280
writ large.

840
01:21:27,159 --> 01:21:30,400
Well, l shall know soon enough. Or not.

841
01:21:32,199 --> 01:21:34,320
For waiting for me is

842
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:37,840
maybe a sudden darkness.

843
01:21:40,359 --> 01:21:42,640
Do not grieve unduly.

844
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:46,160
l have had about as much life
as one can live.

845
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:49,880
You have a long way to go, my son.

846
01:22:00,399 --> 01:22:03,800
Do not spend it all in vengeance.

847
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:08,200
Do not sour it with hatred.

848
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:33,200
Maybe there are no gods.

849
01:22:33,279 --> 01:22:37,280
Maybe one lives on in others.

850
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:41,880
So when you eat a grape, you think of me.

851
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:31,040
Your grief does you credit.

852
01:23:31,119 --> 01:23:34,680
Who would not grieve
such a man as Quintus Arrius?

853
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:37,240
There are many dry eyes, l assure you.

854
01:23:37,319 --> 01:23:40,040
Yes. Well...

855
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:45,600
Marcellus has other concerns, does he not?

856
01:23:46,479 --> 01:23:48,880
Has he managed to placate the Emperor?

857
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:50,960
We are doing our best.

858
01:23:52,239 --> 01:23:54,520
He's persistent, my master.

859
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:58,400
We are headed to Jerusalem
to meet his son at the games.

860
01:23:59,279 --> 01:24:02,160
He means to have him installed there
as his new governor.

861
01:24:04,359 --> 01:24:07,000
My condolences on your loss.

862
01:24:07,079 --> 01:24:11,720
But you'll soon feel better, Sextus Arrius,
now that you have your late father's estates.

863
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:14,800
Perhaps we will meet again
in more cheerful circumstances.

864
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:17,560
At your son's investiture in Jerusalem?

865
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:19,920
What would take you
to that godforsaken place?

866
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,160
Jerusalem is not forsaken by God, Senator.

867
01:24:23,239 --> 01:24:25,280
You're a Jew.

868
01:24:25,359 --> 01:24:27,360
Well, certainly if you come
for the chariot racing,

869
01:24:27,439 --> 01:24:29,600
you will meet Octavius Messala.

870
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:31,000
l will live in hope.

871
01:24:38,479 --> 01:24:40,320
l will miss you, Judah.

872
01:24:52,319 --> 01:24:54,320
Farewell, Quintus Arrius.

873
01:24:57,640 --> 01:25:00,160
l promise you

874
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:03,080
l will not disgrace the name you gave me.

875
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:07,840
But l will have my revenge.

876
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:09,880
No matter the cost.

877
01:25:56,159 --> 01:26:00,880
...and yet forgive them. Once? Seven times?

878
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,040
No. Not once.

879
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,840
Not seven times,

880
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:09,080
but 70 times seven.

881
01:26:09,159 --> 01:26:13,320
We've heard it said,
''An eye for eye, a tooth for tooth.''

882
01:26:13,399 --> 01:26:17,520
l say to you,
do not fight those that wish to harm you.

883
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:20,960
lf someone hits your left cheek,
offer them the right.

884
01:26:21,439 --> 01:26:24,800
lf they ask for your tunic,
give them your cloak as well.

885
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:33,800
Forgive them,
for they know not what they do.

886
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:38,640
for they know not what they do.
forgve them.

887
01:26:49,159 --> 01:26:51,880
lf they say, ''Walk this mile with me,''

888
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:54,240
walk two miles.

889
01:26:54,319 --> 01:26:56,280
As you've heard it said,

890
01:26:56,359 --> 01:26:59,280
''You should love your neighbour,
and hate your enemy.''

891
01:26:59,359 --> 01:27:02,760
But l say to you, love your enemies

892
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:05,080
and bless those who curse you.

893
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:25,240
Please, can you help a leper?

894
01:27:45,479 --> 01:27:47,520
Step back!

895
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:19,400
You are under arrest!

896
01:28:22,319 --> 01:28:24,200
You are under arrest!

897
01:28:39,039 --> 01:28:40,920
Stay!

898
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,040
Stay there.

899
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,880
And what brings you
to this armpit of a country?

900
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:42,280
l've come for the games.

901
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,760
Come. Empty your mind
of what troubles you.

902
01:29:49,159 --> 01:29:51,000
David.

903
01:29:51,079 --> 01:29:52,280
-Esther.
-Leave me alone.

904
01:29:52,359 --> 01:29:54,320
What's happened to you?

905
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:57,440
My sentence was life at the oars!

906
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:59,360
When does Octavus Messala arrve?

907
01:29:59,439 --> 01:30:01,320
Octavius Messala will be here?

908
01:30:01,399 --> 01:30:03,360
l told you your replacement was on his way.

909
01:30:04,039 --> 01:30:07,400
My son has many good qualities,
but patience is not one of them.

910
01:30:09,199 --> 01:30:10,760
Have some care there.

911
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:12,040
So that is your son?

912
01:30:12,119 --> 01:30:13,560
Yes, of course. You have not met.

913
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:14,880
l will meet him tonight.

914
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:18,480
What was it,
the name of the family you lived with?

915
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:19,880
Who cares?

916
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:23,040
Welcome, Marcellus.

917
01:30:23,119 --> 01:30:25,560
Most especially Octavius Messala.

918
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:26,880
What's this game, Judah?

919
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:29,120
This game is one that you will lose.

920
01:30:29,199 --> 01:30:30,960
l should have had him crucified
as Pilate ordered!

921
01:30:31,039 --> 01:30:32,160
What stopped you?

922
01:30:32,239 --> 01:30:33,800
l'll challenge him to race me in the games.

923
01:30:34,239 --> 01:30:35,240
Judah Ben Hur!

924
01:30:35,319 --> 01:30:37,280
l mean to see the light go out in your eyes.

925
01:30:37,359 --> 01:30:39,560
The race can be to the death
as easily as to the line.

926
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:41,600
These damn games were not trouble enough.

927
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:44,160
lt wll only rouse the populace,
lke ths zealot n town.

928
01:30:44,239 --> 01:30:46,840
Wait until after the race and hand him over.

929
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:49,440
-Forgive him.
-l have no forgiveness in me.

930
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:50,840
