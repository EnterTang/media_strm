<b>Running Man Episode 538</b>
No Guests

2
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:39,425
Today's special is
Running Man Rewritten.

3
00:00:39,511 --> 00:00:40,940
We will rewrite...

4
00:00:40,964 --> 00:00:43,194
some of the content on Running Man's
website that has stayed the same...

5
00:00:43,194 --> 00:00:45,563
- for 10 years now.
- Really?

6
00:00:45,563 --> 00:00:48,634
Does anyone know the production
objective that Cho Hyo Jin wrote?

7
00:00:48,634 --> 00:00:50,073
Isn't it "Don't walk, run."?

8
00:00:50,073 --> 00:00:52,374
It's "From landmarks
stuck in the city..."

9
00:00:52,404 --> 00:00:53,874
"Landmarks that represent Korea."

10
00:00:53,874 --> 00:00:54,874
"Running Man will let
you know about them."

11
00:00:54,874 --> 00:00:56,413
"They will do missions
everywhere to win games..."

12
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:58,113
and escape from that place
before the next morning.

13
00:00:58,143 --> 00:01:00,784
- It was like that in the past.
- This really must be changed.

14
00:01:00,784 --> 00:01:03,483
- It was still like this.
- But there is a need for change.

15
00:01:03,514 --> 00:01:05,454
There's also something else.
"MC Yu" is the nickname,

16
00:01:05,484 --> 00:01:07,153
and there's a one-sentence comment.

17
00:01:07,153 --> 00:01:09,393
I wore that for Episode 100.

18
00:01:09,393 --> 00:01:10,693
"He has a charm where strength
and softness exist together."

19
00:01:10,693 --> 00:01:14,494
- Where is his softness?
- That makes no sense.

20
00:01:14,494 --> 00:01:16,893
It says "He has a strange charm."

21
00:01:17,263 --> 00:01:18,393
"Unlucky Rising Star"?

22
00:01:18,393 --> 00:01:20,204
You must have not had any nicknames.

23
00:01:20,204 --> 00:01:24,274
That's really written
carelessly. I really hate you.

24
00:01:24,274 --> 00:01:27,543
So if you write everyone's nicknames,

25
00:01:27,543 --> 00:01:28,674
one-sentence comments,

26
00:01:28,674 --> 00:01:30,774
and production objective
from your ideas...

27
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,484
The winner's content will
be posted on our website.

28
00:01:33,513 --> 00:01:37,153
We will spin a roulette at the
end of today to decide a winner.

29
00:01:38,183 --> 00:01:39,724
The entire website will be changed?

30
00:01:39,754 --> 00:01:41,554
- The whole thing will be changed.
- This is hard.

31
00:01:41,554 --> 00:01:43,653
We must pay some attention to this then.

32
00:01:43,653 --> 00:01:45,763
"Variety shows are
disappearing these days."

33
00:01:45,793 --> 00:01:47,293
- Gosh.
- Gosh, Jae Seok.

34
00:01:47,293 --> 00:01:49,063
- The introduction is good, right?
- That's right.

35
00:01:49,263 --> 00:01:51,093
"Beyond Korea" is too...

36
00:01:51,093 --> 00:01:52,964
It sounds too much like
bragging. Isn't that right?

37
00:01:53,334 --> 00:01:55,733
- But we need that.
- It's kind of our pride.

38
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:57,774
- Right.
- We need that.

39
00:01:57,774 --> 00:02:00,573
"The pride of Korea's variety shows."

40
00:02:00,744 --> 00:02:01,974
"Based on a worldwide
fandom beyond Korea..."

41
00:02:01,974 --> 00:02:04,043
"A giant scale."

42
00:02:04,043 --> 00:02:05,373
"A tremendous amount
of production cost."

43
00:02:05,683 --> 00:02:07,543
That's cool. That's like a blockbuster.

44
00:02:07,543 --> 00:02:08,783
Here's the production objective.

45
00:02:09,283 --> 00:02:11,983
"The eight people who grew up
on love will make you laugh."

46
00:02:12,153 --> 00:02:14,354
"'The fruits of studying hard
will show themselves later.'"

47
00:02:14,423 --> 00:02:15,793
"Do you all know that saying?"

48
00:02:16,323 --> 00:02:17,554
"It means something good."

49
00:02:19,293 --> 00:02:20,894
"Open your eyes. Fun on
a big scale will come."

50
00:02:20,894 --> 00:02:23,093
"Open your mouth. Laughter
on a big scale will come."

51
00:02:23,093 --> 00:02:25,933
"Open your heart. A
great lesson will come."

52
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:27,604
Bravo!

53
00:02:27,604 --> 00:02:30,203
"Growing the long hair
on his ear to live long,"

54
00:02:30,203 --> 00:02:32,403
"he's a hard-working man
who is soon-to-be 60."

55
00:02:33,073 --> 00:02:34,474
I don't have a long hair.

56
00:02:34,474 --> 00:02:37,013
"He's Protein Monster who's
got the surprising ability..."

57
00:02:37,013 --> 00:02:39,483
"to make people uncomfortable
with his excessive love."

58
00:02:39,483 --> 00:02:40,484
"He doesn't care about B Class actors."

59
00:02:40,484 --> 00:02:41,544
"He only cares about A Class actors."

60
00:02:41,584 --> 00:02:42,653
What's wrong with him?

61
00:02:42,683 --> 00:02:44,153
He's "Mr. Dirty Mustache
Who Pretends to Be..."

62
00:02:44,153 --> 00:02:46,283
"the Youngest Among the
Celebrities Born in 1979."

63
00:02:46,424 --> 00:02:47,424
He's "Mr. Dirty Mustache
Who Pretends to Be..."

64
00:02:47,454 --> 00:02:48,584
"the Youngest Among the
Celebrities Born in 1979."

65
00:02:48,853 --> 00:02:49,894
That's his nickname.

66
00:02:50,193 --> 00:02:51,653
His nickname is "Mr. Dirty Mustache".

67
00:02:51,824 --> 00:02:53,663
"Keeping its place for 10 years."

68
00:02:53,693 --> 00:02:54,864
"It's the gateway to becoming a star."

69
00:02:54,894 --> 00:02:57,334
"Running Man is the best man out there!"

70
00:02:57,494 --> 00:02:58,693
"It involves all of the above."

71
00:02:58,693 --> 00:03:01,734
"It's beyond amazing.
Get ready to have fun."

72
00:03:01,864 --> 00:03:02,973
"Song Ji Hyo."

73
00:03:02,973 --> 00:03:06,644
"She once had a crush on
Haha and was heartbroken."

74
00:03:06,744 --> 00:03:08,774
"But being a cool guy, Haha
asked her to be his sister."

75
00:03:08,774 --> 00:03:11,674
"Now, she and Haha are
the cutest Mapo Siblings."

76
00:03:11,674 --> 00:03:12,984
You are crazy, aren't you?

77
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,413
"He went from a gangster
to a Grand Award winner."

78
00:03:16,084 --> 00:03:17,913
"He went from a gangster to a
Grand Award winner." Love it.

79
00:03:18,514 --> 00:03:21,123
"He's cute and sexy. It's crazy."

80
00:03:21,123 --> 00:03:23,123
"He's popular but humble."

81
00:03:23,123 --> 00:03:26,424
"Haha is cool enough to let
Jong Kook win the Grand Award."

82
00:03:26,424 --> 00:03:28,093
"What will he do next?"

83
00:03:28,093 --> 00:03:29,193
What is that?

84
00:03:29,394 --> 00:03:31,593
- What is that?
- He says that all the time.

85
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:32,933
- Kim Jong Kook.
- Kook Jong.

86
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:35,704
Me? I didn't write a lot.

87
00:03:35,704 --> 00:03:37,633
It's okay. Make it short.

88
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:39,674
Gosh, I think this is too formal.

89
00:03:39,674 --> 00:03:42,843
"With the global fandom beyond Korea,"

90
00:03:42,843 --> 00:03:44,473
"Running Man has become the
center of Korean variety shows."

91
00:03:44,774 --> 00:03:47,214
He must be shy. He seems anxious now.

92
00:03:47,214 --> 00:03:48,644
"It's the gateway to becoming a star."

93
00:03:48,644 --> 00:03:51,153
"Through talks and games that
attract viewers of all ages,"

94
00:03:51,153 --> 00:03:55,623
"Korea's representative variety
show spreads K-Culture."

95
00:03:55,683 --> 00:03:58,853
This is real. He is serious
about this. I love it.

96
00:03:58,853 --> 00:04:00,764
It sounds like SBS wrote it.

97
00:04:00,764 --> 00:04:02,464
We also need things like this.

98
00:04:02,794 --> 00:04:04,693
"Yu Jae Seok. His nickname
is 'Unchanging Goofball'."

99
00:04:04,693 --> 00:04:05,864
Is that all you wrote?

100
00:04:05,864 --> 00:04:07,503
The thing is...

101
00:04:07,503 --> 00:04:08,533
- I wrote the others first.
- I love it.

102
00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:09,774
- I was going to come back to this.
- I like it anyway.

103
00:04:09,774 --> 00:04:10,873
- You like it.
- I do.

104
00:04:10,873 --> 00:04:12,744
- "Unchanging Goofball".
- Good.

105
00:04:12,744 --> 00:04:15,204
"Jee Seok Jin. The Lynx of talk
shows called 'Jee-rasoni'."

106
00:04:15,204 --> 00:04:17,544
"He's burning the last embers
of his variety show career."

107
00:04:17,544 --> 00:04:19,484
- Good.
- Hey.

108
00:04:19,584 --> 00:04:21,783
When will your last
passion come to an end?

109
00:04:21,783 --> 00:04:23,484
Last? It's not like...

110
00:04:23,484 --> 00:04:25,153
- "The Last Leaf".
- It's like eternal youth.

111
00:04:25,153 --> 00:04:27,324
- Good luck.
- Go, Jee Seok Jin!

112
00:04:27,324 --> 00:04:30,093
"Kim Jong Kook. 'Anyang Tantrum'
who throws a tantrum when he's mad."

113
00:04:30,093 --> 00:04:31,424
He admits it too.

114
00:04:31,424 --> 00:04:33,764
"He's a singer. He sings
well and has many hit songs."

115
00:04:33,764 --> 00:04:36,234
"But he's better known
as an entertainer now."

116
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,394
Okay.

117
00:04:37,394 --> 00:04:39,093
- That was about him.
- Gosh.

118
00:04:39,093 --> 00:04:41,033
"Haha. Short Guy, Small Guy,"

119
00:04:41,033 --> 00:04:42,804
"Haha PD, A Guy Who's Short but Happy".

120
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,533
"He's an indispensable
seasoning in Running Man."

121
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:46,244
"But he's more focused on
his YouTube these days."

122
00:04:46,304 --> 00:04:48,174
Is he a seasoning?

123
00:04:48,843 --> 00:04:49,913
- Seasoning.
- "Lee Kwang Soo."

124
00:04:49,913 --> 00:04:51,743
"Just Crazy, Forever Star Butler."

125
00:04:51,743 --> 00:04:53,014
Why do you keep saying "Star Butler"?

126
00:04:53,014 --> 00:04:55,144
"He's ugly, but he finds it
hard to accept the fact."

127
00:04:55,144 --> 00:04:57,184
"He's ugly, but he finds it
hard to accept the fact."

128
00:04:57,184 --> 00:04:58,684
"His fans spoiled him."

129
00:04:58,684 --> 00:04:59,684
What?

130
00:04:59,684 --> 00:05:01,184
"His fans spoiled him."

131
00:05:01,184 --> 00:05:02,754
What?

132
00:05:02,754 --> 00:05:05,493
- Exactly. His fans spoiled him.
- That can't be my introduction.

133
00:05:05,493 --> 00:05:06,694
It's the fans.

134
00:05:06,694 --> 00:05:08,293
They didn't spoil me.

135
00:05:08,293 --> 00:05:10,793
They say he's handsome, so
he thinks he's handsome.

136
00:05:10,793 --> 00:05:12,163
"He finds it hard to accept
the fact." It's hilarious.

137
00:05:12,163 --> 00:05:14,033
- My gosh.
- He can't accept it.

138
00:05:14,033 --> 00:05:15,334
- This is crazy.
- "Yang Se Chan."

139
00:05:15,334 --> 00:05:17,533
"Yechani, Yang Sebastian,
and Gum Angel."

140
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:18,733
Good. I like my nicknames.

141
00:05:19,303 --> 00:05:20,444
"Kim Jong Kook's favorite doll."

142
00:05:20,473 --> 00:05:21,704
"But he badmouths me behind my back."

143
00:05:21,743 --> 00:05:23,973
"He's pretending to be innocent, but
once there's proof, I'll kill him."

144
00:05:24,173 --> 00:05:26,283
"He's pretending to be innocent, but
once there's proof, I'll kill him."

145
00:05:27,343 --> 00:05:28,843
This is a declaration of war.

146
00:05:30,184 --> 00:05:31,684
I didn't badmouth you.

147
00:05:31,684 --> 00:05:33,324
- Who's up next?
- I made it short.

148
00:05:33,324 --> 00:05:34,754
- It's simple.
- Good.

149
00:05:34,754 --> 00:05:35,783
Make it short.

150
00:05:35,783 --> 00:05:37,254
I was serious about the
production objective though.

151
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:38,394
This stuff can last a while.

152
00:05:38,423 --> 00:05:41,464
"It's spreading to the whole world
beyond Korea? No, to outer space."

153
00:05:41,793 --> 00:05:44,194
"The members make up for
each other's deficiencies."

154
00:05:44,194 --> 00:05:47,803
"The piller of Korean variety shows
that the whole family can enjoy."

155
00:05:47,803 --> 00:05:48,803
- Okay.
- Good.

156
00:05:48,803 --> 00:05:50,303
"Piller?" Does it say "piller"?

157
00:05:50,303 --> 00:05:51,973
- "Piller?"
- What?

158
00:05:51,973 --> 00:05:53,574
- "Piller?"
- What?

159
00:05:53,743 --> 00:05:55,144
It's "pillar", you punk.

160
00:05:55,144 --> 00:05:56,473
- It's a typo.
- It's not a typo.

161
00:05:56,473 --> 00:05:58,014
You also said "piller".

162
00:05:58,014 --> 00:05:59,243
"The piller of Korean variety shows
that the whole family can enjoy."

163
00:05:59,243 --> 00:06:00,243
- Okay.
- Good.

164
00:06:00,243 --> 00:06:01,584
- It's a typo.
- It's not acorn jelly.

165
00:06:01,584 --> 00:06:03,153
It's not a dialect.

166
00:06:03,153 --> 00:06:05,153
It's "pillar". Do you even
know what a pillar is?

167
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:07,923
- What?
- Do you know what it means?

168
00:06:07,923 --> 00:06:09,423
It's like a support.

169
00:06:09,493 --> 00:06:11,093
That's it. Just move on.

170
00:06:11,093 --> 00:06:12,694
- Please change the spelling.
- It's okay.

171
00:06:12,694 --> 00:06:15,124
If Kwang Soo wins, you
should go with this.

172
00:06:15,394 --> 00:06:18,194
Member introductions. "Jee
Seok Jin. I'm still vigorous."

173
00:06:18,194 --> 00:06:19,663
"I'm still vigorous."

174
00:06:20,863 --> 00:06:21,863
"Yu Jae Seok."

175
00:06:22,303 --> 00:06:23,303
"Yu Jae Seok."

176
00:06:23,303 --> 00:06:24,303
"Bring it on."

177
00:06:24,303 --> 00:06:26,704
"I will stay ranked eighth by
looks no matter who comes."

178
00:06:26,704 --> 00:06:28,903
Gosh, that was...

179
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:31,374
- I love it.
- He's crazy.

180
00:06:31,574 --> 00:06:34,214
"Kim Jong Kook. My heart
is like a soy sauce dish."

181
00:06:34,584 --> 00:06:37,153
"My heart is like a soy sauce dish."

182
00:06:37,384 --> 00:06:39,254
Are you saying he's petty?

183
00:06:39,254 --> 00:06:40,584
Are you saying he's petty?

184
00:06:40,584 --> 00:06:42,584
- Good.
- "Haha. Old Fossil".

185
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:45,324
"Come to me if you
want to get an earful."

186
00:06:45,324 --> 00:06:47,324
I'm talking now!

187
00:06:47,863 --> 00:06:49,293
- Good.
- "Song Ji Hyo."

188
00:06:49,293 --> 00:06:50,293
"Go ahead and text me."

189
00:06:50,293 --> 00:06:51,863
"I'll ignore it anyway."

190
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:54,264
I love it.

191
00:06:55,434 --> 00:06:56,574
I love it.

192
00:06:56,574 --> 00:07:00,144
"Jeon So Min. It's me who
made Running Man PG-15."

193
00:07:00,274 --> 00:07:02,074
"I'll make it Rated R in 2021."

194
00:07:05,243 --> 00:07:06,413
- Good.
- "Yang Se Chan."

195
00:07:06,413 --> 00:07:07,714
- "Poop".
- Hey!

196
00:07:07,843 --> 00:07:08,983
Hey!

197
00:07:08,983 --> 00:07:10,483
What's that?

198
00:07:10,584 --> 00:07:12,084
I lost my concentration toward the end.

199
00:07:12,084 --> 00:07:14,184
It doesn't mean anything.
It's just one word.

200
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,423
- I lost my concentration.
- It's funny though.

201
00:07:15,423 --> 00:07:17,423
- I like it.
- How could he say that?

202
00:07:17,423 --> 00:07:19,124
I like it. It's short and good.

203
00:07:19,124 --> 00:07:21,163
"Lee Kwang Soo. We didn't know..."

204
00:07:21,163 --> 00:07:22,964
"how charming he was."

205
00:07:23,134 --> 00:07:25,194
Gosh, I hate him.

206
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:28,264
It makes me want to vomit.

207
00:07:28,334 --> 00:07:30,303
Mine is short too.

208
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,934
The production objective.
"Variety shows are..."

209
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:32,944
"disappearing these days."

210
00:07:32,973 --> 00:07:34,343
"Running Man is Korea's favorite
variety show that's been..."

211
00:07:34,343 --> 00:07:35,874
"on Sunday nights for over 10 years."

212
00:07:35,903 --> 00:07:38,944
"The members play games and clear
missions with various guest stars,"

213
00:07:38,944 --> 00:07:40,584
"as they go around to different places."

214
00:07:40,584 --> 00:07:42,413
"Among various fun factors,"

215
00:07:42,413 --> 00:07:44,384
"this show only focuses on laughter."

216
00:07:44,384 --> 00:07:46,084
This is the true production objective.

217
00:07:46,084 --> 00:07:47,153
I hope this will go on the website.

218
00:07:47,153 --> 00:07:49,053
This is how Jae Seok
thinks of Running Man.

219
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:50,894
The writers are giving him a big hand.

220
00:07:50,894 --> 00:07:52,153
Why are you clapping your hands?

221
00:07:52,153 --> 00:07:55,093
"We only care about laughter."

222
00:07:55,093 --> 00:07:56,694
"We only care about laughter."

223
00:07:56,694 --> 00:07:57,993
- Cool.
- Right.

224
00:07:57,993 --> 00:08:00,303
It's not like you're
submitting a report.

225
00:08:00,303 --> 00:08:02,233
"Jee Seok Jin. He was going to
leave the team in the first year."

226
00:08:02,334 --> 00:08:04,274
"Jee Seok Jin. He was going to
leave the team in the first year."

227
00:08:04,274 --> 00:08:06,874
"But now he says Running
Man is the best."

228
00:08:07,644 --> 00:08:10,274
- Jae Seok!
- That's just a message to him.

229
00:08:10,274 --> 00:08:13,983
- "His behavior is frowned upon..."
- That's just a message to him.

230
00:08:14,343 --> 00:08:16,113
- Hey.
- That's basically a letter.

231
00:08:16,184 --> 00:08:17,913
That's just something
we say among ourselves.

232
00:08:17,954 --> 00:08:20,553
This is my introduction. It's mine.

233
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,024
It's like...

234
00:08:22,324 --> 00:08:24,053
It's like an article for the tabloids.

235
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:25,723
Yes, that's right. The tabloids.

236
00:08:25,723 --> 00:08:27,624
It's just how I feel about him.

237
00:08:27,663 --> 00:08:29,024
"His behavior is frowned upon by many."

238
00:08:29,024 --> 00:08:30,764
- It's excessive.
- It's totally for the tabloids.

239
00:08:30,764 --> 00:08:33,334
- You praise the show excessively.
- He's right.

240
00:08:33,464 --> 00:08:35,434
- I'm not excessive.
- And everyone hates it.

241
00:08:35,434 --> 00:08:36,603
My goodness.

242
00:08:36,603 --> 00:08:37,634
"Yu Jae Seok."

243
00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:40,243
"The official prankster of
Running Man, Yooruce Willis."

244
00:08:40,243 --> 00:08:41,343
- Okay.
- Jee Seok Jin.

245
00:08:41,343 --> 00:08:42,473
"Kim Jong Kook."

246
00:08:42,473 --> 00:08:44,843
"Called 'Kim Nipple' during summer
and 'Enema Kim' in other seasons."

247
00:08:44,843 --> 00:08:47,314
"Also known as 'Go Large' and
won the Grand Award in 2020."

248
00:08:47,314 --> 00:08:48,913
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

249
00:08:49,014 --> 00:08:51,413
"And won the Grand Award
in 2020." Congratulations!

250
00:08:51,413 --> 00:08:52,923
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

251
00:08:52,923 --> 00:08:55,084
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

252
00:08:55,184 --> 00:08:57,454
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

253
00:08:58,293 --> 00:09:01,624
How long do we have to
congratulate him for the award?

254
00:09:01,723 --> 00:09:04,033
"Song Ji Hyo. Real name is
Cheon Seong Im, Cheon Su Yeon."

255
00:09:04,033 --> 00:09:05,133
"Nickname is 'Jeoktoma'."

256
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:07,564
"We can't say that she gets
along well with the members,"

257
00:09:07,564 --> 00:09:08,964
"but we also can't
say that she doesn't."

258
00:09:09,363 --> 00:09:11,603
"To cut a long story short,
Ji Hyo is funny these days."

259
00:09:12,973 --> 00:09:14,074
Next is...

260
00:09:14,074 --> 00:09:16,574
"Haha. He's the dad of three kids.
He's officially an old fossil now."

261
00:09:16,574 --> 00:09:17,843
- "But he still doesn't know it."
- Why am I an old fossil?

262
00:09:17,843 --> 00:09:19,314
"He doesn't want to admit it."

263
00:09:19,314 --> 00:09:21,414
"Recently, he sent me
half-dried herring".

264
00:09:21,684 --> 00:09:24,454
- "He sent me half-dried herring."
- Why tell us that?

265
00:09:24,454 --> 00:09:26,853
Is it necessary to write about
that in his introduction?

266
00:09:26,853 --> 00:09:29,454
I wanted to write about
things the viewers don't know.

267
00:09:29,454 --> 00:09:31,523
Who is "me" in the introduction?

268
00:09:31,523 --> 00:09:32,893
- That's me.
- It's you?

269
00:09:32,893 --> 00:09:34,824
- You can't write about yourself.
- All right.

270
00:09:35,123 --> 00:09:37,893
"Lee Kwang Soo. He can grow
taller but he doesn't try harder."

271
00:09:37,964 --> 00:09:40,103
- He doesn't try harder.
- Hey.

272
00:09:40,103 --> 00:09:41,164
You keep saying that.

273
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,603
- Then try harder.
- Yes, drink some milk.

274
00:09:42,603 --> 00:09:43,934
- He's right.
- Why won't you try harder?

275
00:09:43,934 --> 00:09:45,574
- Drink milk and play basketball.
- What are you talking about?

276
00:09:46,273 --> 00:09:47,373
Next is Jeon So Min.

277
00:09:47,373 --> 00:09:50,214
"I've seen her for a while
and she really is crazy."

278
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,174
"Yang Se Chan. Yang Se Hyeong's
brother. Has handsome gums."

279
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,414
"It seems he has a girlfriend."

280
00:09:53,414 --> 00:09:54,784
"It seems he has a girlfriend."

281
00:09:54,784 --> 00:09:56,483
- I don't.
- That's all I have.

282
00:09:56,483 --> 00:09:57,714
- Okay.
- Okay.

283
00:09:57,714 --> 00:09:58,714
It was good.

284
00:09:58,714 --> 00:10:00,824
- It was very neat.
- It was, wasn't it?

285
00:10:01,123 --> 00:10:03,753
I thought it'd be better to
write a lot about the show.

286
00:10:03,753 --> 00:10:05,593
You wrote a lot. It's very long.

287
00:10:06,324 --> 00:10:10,593
"A show that makes the entire
country, and beyond, run as one."

288
00:10:10,893 --> 00:10:12,834
She's actually right.

289
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:14,863
"Running Man carries out missions
like we only live today."

290
00:10:14,863 --> 00:10:16,603
"Eight members with different
colors go through many troubles..."

291
00:10:16,603 --> 00:10:19,133
"to deliver a great deal of joy
and extraordinary entertainment."

292
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:21,473
She used all the fancy words she knows.

293
00:10:21,473 --> 00:10:24,074
"Stay tuned for the charm
of the eight members..."

294
00:10:24,074 --> 00:10:25,513
"which we will show you
anywhere and in any situation."

295
00:10:26,914 --> 00:10:29,383
- Ji Hyo, I love that. "Stay tuned".
- "Stay tuned!"

296
00:10:29,383 --> 00:10:30,554
- Stay tuned.
- Okay.

297
00:10:31,013 --> 00:10:32,054
Next is...

298
00:10:32,054 --> 00:10:33,054
Who's the thug?

299
00:10:33,054 --> 00:10:34,753
- "Kim Thug."
- Okay, "Kim Thug".

300
00:10:34,753 --> 00:10:36,954
"You'll be sorry if you judge
him only by his muscles."

301
00:10:37,023 --> 00:10:39,824
"No one can catch up to his
good sense and witty words."

302
00:10:39,824 --> 00:10:41,424
- "All Mighty of all higher beings."
- She's right.

303
00:10:41,424 --> 00:10:43,664
"He likes to reveal his
adorable side sometimes."

304
00:10:43,664 --> 00:10:44,863
"He is unexpectedly charming."

305
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,093
- You're so right.
- Yes.

306
00:10:46,093 --> 00:10:47,804
You know exactly who I am.

307
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,233
"Small business owner."

308
00:10:52,973 --> 00:10:54,503
"President Ha, small
business owner in Mapo-gu."

309
00:10:54,503 --> 00:10:55,603
That is funny.

310
00:10:55,603 --> 00:10:57,473
- Small business owner in Mapo-gu.
- That is funny.

311
00:10:58,414 --> 00:11:00,044
"How capable and resourceful is he?"

312
00:11:00,044 --> 00:11:02,284
"He's capable of both running a
business and running on the show."

313
00:11:02,284 --> 00:11:04,284
"President Ha is a greedy
man who wants it all!"

314
00:11:04,284 --> 00:11:05,654
Do you think it's appropriate...

315
00:11:05,654 --> 00:11:07,284
to write that in the
member introduction?

316
00:11:08,723 --> 00:11:10,893
You can't write about
his personal business.

317
00:11:10,893 --> 00:11:12,353
"He's capable of running a business."

318
00:11:12,654 --> 00:11:15,164
- Well, he does a lot of things.
- Hey.

319
00:11:15,164 --> 00:11:16,664
It's my business.

320
00:11:16,664 --> 00:11:18,464
- I wrote "a small business owner."
- She can't compliment him...

321
00:11:18,464 --> 00:11:20,934
for running his business well
in the member introduction.

322
00:11:20,934 --> 00:11:22,263
- What about Song Ji Hyo?
- "Song Ji Hyo."

323
00:11:22,503 --> 00:11:24,003
Well, I wasn't sure what I should say.

324
00:11:24,003 --> 00:11:25,934
So I wrote, "Finally, she's trying
to step out into the world."

325
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:27,174
Maybe that's how you feel.

326
00:11:27,174 --> 00:11:29,873
"She's learning how fun it
is to be out in the world."

327
00:11:30,044 --> 00:11:31,574
"Song Ji Hyo is stepping
out into the world."

328
00:11:31,574 --> 00:11:32,643
Congratulations!

329
00:11:32,643 --> 00:11:33,843
"Song Ji Hyo is going
out into the world."

330
00:11:33,843 --> 00:11:35,284
Congratulations!

331
00:11:35,284 --> 00:11:36,954
Yes, you should communicate with others.

332
00:11:38,914 --> 00:11:40,924
You're finally stepping
out into the world?

333
00:11:40,924 --> 00:11:41,983
Finally.

334
00:11:41,983 --> 00:11:43,054
Song Communication.

335
00:11:43,353 --> 00:11:45,023
Okay, Song Jeoktoma!

336
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:49,093
- Song Jeoktoma.
- Yes, come on out. And call me.

337
00:11:49,164 --> 00:11:50,294
Let's have a meal together.

338
00:11:50,434 --> 00:11:51,664
We're supposed to be social distancing.

339
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:56,873
- Seok Jin.
- In spirit only.

340
00:11:56,873 --> 00:11:58,633
- Be with her in spirit only.
- Sure.

341
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:00,103
- In spirit only. My apologies.
- All right.

342
00:12:00,773 --> 00:12:02,204
Next is Jee Seok Jin.

343
00:12:03,914 --> 00:12:05,143
"He doesn't know himself."

344
00:12:05,214 --> 00:12:08,084
"He's the Hugh Grant of Jamwon-dong
who pretends to love his family."

345
00:12:09,214 --> 00:12:12,154
"He's the Hugh Grant of Jamwon-dong
who pretends to love his family."

346
00:12:14,353 --> 00:12:15,623
I love it.

347
00:12:15,623 --> 00:12:17,294
- "The Hugh Grant of Jamwon-dong."
- Today...

348
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,493
Ji Hyo is stepping out into the world.

349
00:12:19,493 --> 00:12:20,623
"The Hugh Grant of Jamwon-dong."

350
00:12:20,623 --> 00:12:21,723
It was great.

351
00:12:21,723 --> 00:12:23,464
"Find yourself falling for his charm."

352
00:12:23,464 --> 00:12:25,763
"The Hugh Grant of Jamwon-dong."

353
00:12:25,763 --> 00:12:26,834
What's that?

354
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:28,304
- It's kind of ambiguous.
- Hugh Grant.

355
00:12:28,304 --> 00:12:30,674
I'm not offended but
can't say I'm pleased.

356
00:12:30,973 --> 00:12:32,704
It's good since it's Hugh Grant.

357
00:12:32,704 --> 00:12:34,204
Hugh Grant is amazing.

358
00:12:34,204 --> 00:12:35,704
Yes, it's good that
she compared me to him.

359
00:12:35,704 --> 00:12:37,273
We got two amazing nicknames today.

360
00:12:37,273 --> 00:12:39,174
- "The Hugh Grant of Jamwon-dong."
- And "Mr. Dirty Mustache".

361
00:12:39,174 --> 00:12:40,684
- Yes, "Mr. Dirty Mustache".
- That's right.

362
00:12:41,084 --> 00:12:42,214
"The Hugh Grant of
Jamwon-dong" is funny.

363
00:12:43,383 --> 00:12:44,454
All right.

364
00:12:44,613 --> 00:12:46,084
Hello, everyone.

365
00:12:46,084 --> 00:12:47,223
- Hi.
- The production objective.

366
00:12:47,223 --> 00:12:50,694
"The funniest show ever in Korea
and in any country in the world."

367
00:12:50,694 --> 00:12:53,424
"The only show you can enjoy
both the old and the new."

368
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,893
"You can bite, chew, and
taste. We are the real deal."

369
00:12:55,893 --> 00:12:58,294
"The one and only
semi-real variety show."

370
00:12:58,294 --> 00:13:00,464
- "Semi-real variety show".
- "Semi-real".

371
00:13:00,464 --> 00:13:02,534
- It's a bit more than half.
- Actually, it's 100 percent real.

372
00:13:02,704 --> 00:13:05,133
- "The dealer of semi-real variety".
- "semi-real".

373
00:13:05,133 --> 00:13:07,804
"We guarantee your laughter, longevity,"

374
00:13:07,804 --> 00:13:09,473
"love life, marriage,"

375
00:13:09,473 --> 00:13:10,843
"and success in life."

376
00:13:11,714 --> 00:13:13,383
Shouldn't it be "the
leader", not "the dealer"?

377
00:13:13,383 --> 00:13:14,784
Oh, right. It's "the leader".

378
00:13:14,814 --> 00:13:16,454
Shouldn't it be "the
leader", not "the dealer"?

379
00:13:16,454 --> 00:13:18,314
Oh, right. It's "the leader".

380
00:13:18,314 --> 00:13:19,753
- Wait a minute.
- It's "the leader".

381
00:13:19,753 --> 00:13:21,253
- He's right.
- Wait a minute.

382
00:13:21,253 --> 00:13:23,493
- What is "a dealer"?
- My goodness.

383
00:13:23,493 --> 00:13:25,194
How can you make such a mistake?

384
00:13:25,393 --> 00:13:27,623
How hard is it to make a
PowerPoint? Am I right?

385
00:13:28,123 --> 00:13:30,263
- No, no. It's a typo.
- What is "the dealer"?

386
00:13:30,263 --> 00:13:31,493
It's "the leader".

387
00:13:31,493 --> 00:13:32,863
I knew the correct word.

388
00:13:32,934 --> 00:13:34,964
I wrote "piller" as a typo too.

389
00:13:35,204 --> 00:13:36,674
I thought it was written correctly.

390
00:13:36,674 --> 00:13:38,103
"Piller" was a typo.

391
00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:40,404
I confused "the leader"
with "the dealer".

392
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:41,873
- Whatever. That's what you wrote.
- It's "the leader".

393
00:13:41,873 --> 00:13:43,414
- It's "the leader," everyone.
- Okay, what's next?

394
00:13:43,414 --> 00:13:44,544
- Let's move on.
- I knew the actual word.

395
00:13:44,544 --> 00:13:46,444
Next is Jee Seok Jin,
known as "The Senior".

396
00:13:46,584 --> 00:13:48,944
- Gosh, it says "Jee Seok Ji".
- What's "Jee Seok Ji"?

397
00:13:48,944 --> 00:13:50,853
- Gosh.
- You can't fix it now.

398
00:13:51,084 --> 00:13:52,253
She can't fix it.

399
00:13:52,253 --> 00:13:53,324
What's "Jee Seok Ji"?

400
00:13:53,324 --> 00:13:54,723
She can't fix it now.

401
00:13:54,883 --> 00:13:55,983
No, she can't.

402
00:13:55,983 --> 00:13:57,954
- If she wins, I'll be "Seok Ji"?
- Sure.

403
00:13:58,223 --> 00:13:59,654
You're "Jee Seok Ji" even
if you say it backwards.

404
00:13:59,863 --> 00:14:01,123
It's the same even if
you say it backwards.

405
00:14:01,123 --> 00:14:03,964
"The lucky charm, the adorable,
the youngest Jeon So Min."

406
00:14:03,964 --> 00:14:05,794
"No one knows who she really is."

407
00:14:05,893 --> 00:14:08,304
"Running Man unveils
her mysterious charm."

408
00:14:08,603 --> 00:14:11,103
"Running Man unveils
her mysterious charm."

409
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:13,404
"She's good at acting,
comedy, writing, and cooking."

410
00:14:13,404 --> 00:14:15,174
"The perfect entertainer
this generation wants."

411
00:14:15,243 --> 00:14:17,174
"The best entertainer. How
much more can she be charming?"

412
00:14:17,174 --> 00:14:18,273
"We're lucky to have her!"

413
00:14:18,814 --> 00:14:20,113
"We're lucky to have her!"

414
00:14:23,383 --> 00:14:24,383
All right.

415
00:14:24,383 --> 00:14:25,983
- It's Seok Jin's turn.
- I think...

416
00:14:25,983 --> 00:14:27,324
everyone's good enough to be picked.

417
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,184
- Yes, everyone's good.
- Right.

418
00:14:29,184 --> 00:14:30,223
- They're not bad.
- If I win,

419
00:14:30,223 --> 00:14:32,093
- mine will be posted, right?
- Yes.

420
00:14:32,093 --> 00:14:33,164
All right.

421
00:14:33,464 --> 00:14:34,623
The production objective.

422
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:35,924
"The new hearth of Running Man,"

423
00:14:36,064 --> 00:14:37,633
- "Jee Seok Jin leads the new show."
- "Hearth"?

424
00:14:37,694 --> 00:14:39,664
"The new hearth of Running Man,
Jee Seok Jin leads the new show."

425
00:14:39,664 --> 00:14:41,404
- "Hearth"?
- Running Man.

426
00:14:41,404 --> 00:14:42,603
- Wait.
- What?

427
00:14:42,603 --> 00:14:43,834
- Are you nervous?
- No.

428
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:45,733
Wait a minute.

429
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:47,044
- Well, I think...
- I'm not nervous.

430
00:14:47,044 --> 00:14:49,743
it's been a long time since he
was in the center of attention.

431
00:14:49,843 --> 00:14:51,743
You said, "The new
hearth of Running Man."

432
00:14:53,513 --> 00:14:55,284
- "Every week, Jee Seok Jin..."
- Don't be nervous.

433
00:14:55,284 --> 00:14:57,383
"fights against the seven losers."

434
00:14:57,383 --> 00:14:58,954
Don't be so nervous.

435
00:14:59,214 --> 00:15:00,284
All right.

436
00:15:00,284 --> 00:15:01,523
Just hang in there.

437
00:15:01,523 --> 00:15:03,054
Hugh Grant!

438
00:15:03,054 --> 00:15:04,654
Hugh Grant!

439
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:05,993
- Hugh...
- Please be quiet.

440
00:15:06,593 --> 00:15:08,694
"He can't be fooled, but
he pretends that he is."

441
00:15:08,893 --> 00:15:10,064
"His name tag can't been ripped..."

442
00:15:10,064 --> 00:15:11,564
"but he lets them rip it off."

443
00:15:11,564 --> 00:15:12,863
The word spacing is terrible.

444
00:15:12,964 --> 00:15:14,534
It's not "can't been ripped".
It's "can't be ripped".

445
00:15:14,534 --> 00:15:16,334
Other words are wrong too.

446
00:15:16,473 --> 00:15:18,603
- Just let it go.
- I can't believe him.

447
00:15:18,773 --> 00:15:20,373
His grammar is terrible.

448
00:15:20,373 --> 00:15:21,503
Just let it go.

449
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,613
"I sacrifice myself to giving
hope to the younger members."

450
00:15:24,074 --> 00:15:25,944
"I is the Giving Tree, Captain Jee."

451
00:15:26,273 --> 00:15:28,513
Shouldn't it be "am" not "is"?

452
00:15:28,613 --> 00:15:29,814
"I is"?

453
00:15:29,814 --> 00:15:30,954
"To giving hope"?

454
00:15:31,483 --> 00:15:32,684
He wrote, "to giving hope".

455
00:15:32,684 --> 00:15:33,784
It's because...

456
00:15:33,784 --> 00:15:35,883
the keyboard arrangement is
different from my generation.

457
00:15:35,883 --> 00:15:36,893
Is it a regional dialect?

458
00:15:36,924 --> 00:15:37,924
Your generation didn't
even have a keyboard.

459
00:15:37,954 --> 00:15:40,593
- "The Giving Tree, Captain Jee."
- What's wrong with you?

460
00:15:40,593 --> 00:15:42,393
"It's not just a variety show anymore."

461
00:15:42,393 --> 00:15:43,434
What's wrong with him?

462
00:15:43,434 --> 00:15:45,993
"In the endless cold
betrayal betrayal..."

463
00:15:45,993 --> 00:15:48,064
Why did you write "betrayal" twice?

464
00:15:48,133 --> 00:15:49,233
What does that mean?

465
00:15:49,263 --> 00:15:51,603
- I'm sorry I wrote it twice.
- What does that mean?

466
00:15:51,603 --> 00:15:52,704
My goodness.

467
00:15:52,704 --> 00:15:53,743
You're unprepared.

468
00:15:53,743 --> 00:15:55,074
Why would you write "betrayal" twice?

469
00:15:55,743 --> 00:15:57,743
My goodness. This is making me cry.

470
00:15:58,044 --> 00:15:59,473
- Gosh, this is so funny.
- That's not it.

471
00:15:59,513 --> 00:16:00,914
- Gosh.
- This is...

472
00:16:00,914 --> 00:16:02,414
He was surprised too.

473
00:16:02,714 --> 00:16:04,684
"Endless cold betrayal betrayal..."

474
00:16:06,353 --> 00:16:08,054
- He was like a broken record.
- Wait a minute.

475
00:16:08,284 --> 00:16:10,154
I'm sorry that I wrote the word twice.

476
00:16:10,154 --> 00:16:11,393
Okay, member introductions.

477
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:14,324
What's this? "Jan Seo Min"?

478
00:16:14,424 --> 00:16:16,164
I'm so sorry.

479
00:16:16,564 --> 00:16:18,664
- My goodness.
- Why so many typos?

480
00:16:18,664 --> 00:16:20,164
- Seok Jin.
- "Any litle?"

481
00:16:20,164 --> 00:16:22,133
- It's just the order.
- It's "Any little thing."

482
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:24,334
"Any little thing can make her go
crazy. No one can control her."

483
00:16:24,334 --> 00:16:26,704
- "The biggest fool on the show."
- Why did he make so many mistakes?

484
00:16:26,704 --> 00:16:27,973
"Buckteeth Se Chan"

485
00:16:27,973 --> 00:16:29,174
"The ugliest."

486
00:16:29,174 --> 00:16:31,414
"He's all talk but no sincerity."

487
00:16:31,643 --> 00:16:33,284
It's witless.

488
00:16:33,513 --> 00:16:35,784
Song Ji Hyo. I named
her "Zoned-out Girl."

489
00:16:37,314 --> 00:16:38,383
Song Ji Hyo. "Zoned-out Girl."

490
00:16:38,383 --> 00:16:41,924
I named her "Zoned-out Girl."

491
00:16:43,154 --> 00:16:44,353
It's not witty.

492
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:47,093
"Zoned-out Girl," the next "Young Gu".

493
00:16:47,263 --> 00:16:49,593
- "Running Man's new fool."
- Wake up, Haha.

494
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:50,834
We're still filming.

495
00:16:50,863 --> 00:16:52,763
Wake up, Haha. We're still filming.

496
00:16:52,964 --> 00:16:55,064
Wait a minute. Wake up, Haha.

497
00:16:55,564 --> 00:16:56,934
Wait a minute. Wake up, Haha.

498
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:58,034
Jae Seok, Jae Seok!

499
00:16:58,034 --> 00:16:59,233
- Jae Seok!
- We're filming.

500
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:00,273
Jae Seok, wake up!

501
00:17:02,574 --> 00:17:03,674
Jae Seok, wake up.

502
00:17:03,674 --> 00:17:05,214
- What?
- We're still filming.

503
00:17:05,414 --> 00:17:07,314
Okay. Look alive, guys!

504
00:17:07,314 --> 00:17:08,343
I fell asleep.

505
00:17:08,343 --> 00:17:10,113
Hang in there, guys. He's almost done.

506
00:17:10,584 --> 00:17:12,414
- Gosh, I fell asleep.
- He's no fun.

507
00:17:12,554 --> 00:17:14,054
- Okay. "Lee Kwang Soo."
- He's not done yet?

508
00:17:14,054 --> 00:17:15,784
"Now he's 350cm tall."

509
00:17:15,954 --> 00:17:18,824
- "He entered the Guinness Book."
- It's already morning.

510
00:17:18,824 --> 00:17:21,363
- Haha!
- "How tall will he get?"

511
00:17:22,164 --> 00:17:23,263
Okay, next.

512
00:17:23,263 --> 00:17:25,034
- This is exhausting.
- "Kim Jong Kook."

513
00:17:25,664 --> 00:17:27,904
- Another typo?
- "The starter of the new rase."

514
00:17:27,904 --> 00:17:30,273
- There's another typo.
- "Experienced much muscle loss."

515
00:17:30,404 --> 00:17:31,633
"He suddenly lost so much muscle."

516
00:17:31,704 --> 00:17:34,574
"His thighs are as slim
as Seok Jin's arms now."

517
00:17:34,904 --> 00:17:37,043
"Now he's the weakest
member of Running Man."

518
00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:38,473
It's like the principal
is giving a speech.

519
00:17:38,874 --> 00:17:40,543
- Seok Jin.
- What?

520
00:17:41,313 --> 00:17:42,614
- What?
- Your face turned red.

521
00:17:42,614 --> 00:17:43,954
No, no. I'm fine.

522
00:17:44,053 --> 00:17:45,283
It's not funny at all.

523
00:17:45,513 --> 00:17:47,323
- Seok Jin.
- Just keep your mouth shut.

524
00:17:47,684 --> 00:17:49,783
- It's really not funny.
- Don't say a word.

525
00:17:50,154 --> 00:17:51,894
- "It's really not funny."
- Next is Haha.

526
00:17:53,124 --> 00:17:54,263
I laughed so much my stomach hurts.

527
00:17:54,493 --> 00:17:55,924
I'm talking about Haha, you punk.

528
00:17:57,134 --> 00:17:58,134
Seok Jin, are you upset?

529
00:17:58,134 --> 00:17:59,464
Yes, I am upset, you punk!

530
00:18:01,464 --> 00:18:03,434
- He's embarrassed.
- Are you all right?

531
00:18:03,434 --> 00:18:04,503
I'm fine.

532
00:18:04,604 --> 00:18:06,003
- Okay, next page.
- My mouth hurts.

533
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:07,503
Gosh, my cheekbones hurt.

534
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,904
"Jee Seok Jin, known as 'Jee-rasoni'."

535
00:18:08,904 --> 00:18:10,743
- "He's there."
- Seok Jin.

536
00:18:10,844 --> 00:18:12,174
Seok Jin noticed it.

537
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,483
He just scanned the entire room.

538
00:18:13,914 --> 00:18:15,313
- Hey.
- He sensed it.

539
00:18:15,313 --> 00:18:16,344
Stay quiet.

540
00:18:16,344 --> 00:18:19,013
"There is no need for
further explanation."

541
00:18:19,154 --> 00:18:20,483
- Is that it?
- "Yu Jae Seok."

542
00:18:20,483 --> 00:18:21,523
It says dirty.

543
00:18:21,523 --> 00:18:23,523
"Yu Jae Seok announced
his retirement this year."

544
00:18:23,523 --> 00:18:24,553
"This is his last work."

545
00:18:24,594 --> 00:18:25,894
- "Pay attention to him."
- He's Jee Grant.

546
00:18:25,924 --> 00:18:27,624
Give me a white towel.

547
00:18:27,624 --> 00:18:28,894
- We don't have a white towel.
- Get him one.

548
00:18:28,894 --> 00:18:30,164
Get me a white towel.

549
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:32,063
Seok Jin is about to cry.

550
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,503
It's hilarious.

551
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:35,563
Gosh, it was so funny.

552
00:18:35,563 --> 00:18:36,803
Seok Jin, is it over?

553
00:18:38,104 --> 00:18:39,134
What?

554
00:18:40,374 --> 00:18:41,674
Why are you swearing?

555
00:18:45,473 --> 00:18:47,043
- Why are you swearing?
- Why are you taking it off?

556
00:18:48,543 --> 00:18:50,614
- Why are you swearing at us?
- Why are you upset?

557
00:18:50,614 --> 00:18:51,914
Why?

558
00:18:51,914 --> 00:18:53,583
What's wrong?

559
00:18:53,624 --> 00:18:55,783
- Fine. Do what you want!
- Come here.

560
00:18:56,223 --> 00:18:57,793
- It's so funny.
- Seok Jin.

561
00:18:57,793 --> 00:18:59,624
- Come here.
- Seok Jin.

562
00:18:59,624 --> 00:19:00,894
- Don't be upset.
- Seok Jin.

563
00:19:08,104 --> 00:19:10,033
Why are you swearing?

564
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:14,644
All right. You can watch
Seok Jin swear on YouTube.

565
00:19:14,973 --> 00:19:17,473
It's called "Spicy
Version Jee Seok Jin".

566
00:19:17,473 --> 00:19:18,513
It's so funny.

567
00:19:19,114 --> 00:19:20,983
I'm sorry I lost my temper.

568
00:19:21,013 --> 00:19:23,553
I laughed a lot.

569
00:19:23,753 --> 00:19:25,384
It's hilarious.

570
00:19:25,654 --> 00:19:26,954
It's killing me.

571
00:19:26,954 --> 00:19:28,553
This is so funny.

572
00:19:29,184 --> 00:19:31,454
I want you guys to pick...

573
00:19:31,454 --> 00:19:32,654
the worst introduction each.

574
00:19:33,323 --> 00:19:34,964
- Can I say it?
- Hey.

575
00:19:34,964 --> 00:19:36,563
- Don't do that.
- You're really mean!

576
00:19:36,894 --> 00:19:39,134
- Don't do that.
- You're really mean!

577
00:19:39,493 --> 00:19:41,464
- There's no need to say.
- Do you really not know?

578
00:19:41,604 --> 00:19:42,733
No need to say it.

579
00:19:42,864 --> 00:19:44,233
- Why do you even ask?
- Do you really not know?

580
00:19:44,404 --> 00:19:46,134
You should pick the worst one.

581
00:19:46,204 --> 00:19:47,743
- 1, 2, 3.
- I can't pick.

582
00:19:48,573 --> 00:19:50,174
Who picked Seok Jin?

583
00:19:50,174 --> 00:19:51,374
- Me.
- Me.

584
00:19:51,543 --> 00:19:53,073
- Me too.
- Four people.

585
00:19:53,073 --> 00:19:55,714
- 5 people.
- There are 5.

586
00:19:55,714 --> 00:19:57,083
There are five.

587
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,783
Jae Seok, Se Chan, and
Kwang Soo got one vote each.

588
00:19:58,854 --> 00:20:00,124
And Seok Jin got five votes.

589
00:20:00,954 --> 00:20:04,894
Like I said, today's special
is Running Man Rewritten.

590
00:20:04,924 --> 00:20:06,793
The winner's content will
be posted on our website.

591
00:20:06,793 --> 00:20:08,063
I'll have mine go on the website.

592
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,894
We have two kinds of roulette here.

593
00:20:10,134 --> 00:20:13,293
The first one has your names on
it, and we will spin it at the end.

594
00:20:13,563 --> 00:20:17,833
It has 40 spots with 5 name tags each.

595
00:20:17,934 --> 00:20:21,444
We will spin it to decide the winner.

596
00:20:21,444 --> 00:20:23,674
And the other roulette
is about benefits.

597
00:20:23,874 --> 00:20:26,344
The winners of each mission
will spin this roulette...

598
00:20:26,344 --> 00:20:28,614
and win the benefit they pick.

599
00:20:28,743 --> 00:20:31,684
According to the roulette,
you will have more...

600
00:20:31,684 --> 00:20:33,954
or less name tags on the roulette.

601
00:20:33,954 --> 00:20:36,654
And you will get paid
as much as the number...

602
00:20:36,654 --> 00:20:37,854
of your name tags on the roulette.

603
00:20:37,854 --> 00:20:39,053
- Really?
- Good.

604
00:20:39,053 --> 00:20:41,793
If you have more name tags on the
roulette, you'll get more money.

605
00:20:41,793 --> 00:20:43,164
It increases the amount of money.

606
00:20:43,164 --> 00:20:45,694
We will start the first
mission once you get changed.

607
00:20:48,464 --> 00:20:49,733
- What is this?
- What's that?

608
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:51,973
What is this thing?

609
00:20:52,134 --> 00:20:53,374
It's getting more advanced.

610
00:20:53,374 --> 00:20:55,803
I'm really curious. Who comes
up with games like this?

611
00:20:56,404 --> 00:20:58,043
This is amazing.

612
00:20:58,273 --> 00:21:00,583
- My goodness.
- There's flour. Is this flour?

613
00:21:00,914 --> 00:21:02,313
What? Is that flour?

614
00:21:02,313 --> 00:21:04,214
- I think this one is better.
- What's that thing?

615
00:21:04,214 --> 00:21:05,583
- Are they marbles?
- Marbles.

616
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:06,854
It might break my head.

617
00:21:06,854 --> 00:21:08,753
- It can't break your head.
- This is the worst.

618
00:21:08,753 --> 00:21:10,053
I might break my head.

619
00:21:10,053 --> 00:21:11,154
This one is...

620
00:21:11,154 --> 00:21:12,753
It's like jelly. It's called frogspawn.

621
00:21:12,753 --> 00:21:14,364
- That's just...
- It's not hard.

622
00:21:14,364 --> 00:21:16,424
How can someone be so untrusting
of our production crew?

623
00:21:16,424 --> 00:21:17,594
A member like that...

624
00:21:17,733 --> 00:21:18,763
I can't believe this.

625
00:21:18,763 --> 00:21:20,704
You should have a
meeting and rule him out.

626
00:21:20,964 --> 00:21:23,263
The production crew wouldn't
put metal marbles in there.

627
00:21:23,803 --> 00:21:25,604
Hey, stop it.

628
00:21:25,604 --> 00:21:27,874
I saw Seok Jin punch the
wall in the restroom earlier.

629
00:21:28,874 --> 00:21:31,114
- I almost cried now.
- Why?

630
00:21:31,273 --> 00:21:32,944
Seok Jin just kicked me,
but it didn't hurt at all.

631
00:21:32,944 --> 00:21:33,944
Come on.

632
00:21:33,944 --> 00:21:35,483
Seok Jin just kicked me,
but it didn't hurt at all.

633
00:21:35,483 --> 00:21:36,513
Come on.

634
00:21:36,513 --> 00:21:38,384
- Jae Seok, that's so sad.
- Hey.

635
00:21:39,783 --> 00:21:41,354
I just kicked you gently.

636
00:21:42,124 --> 00:21:44,354
- I just kicked you gently.
- What should I do?

637
00:21:44,523 --> 00:21:46,424
Kook Jong, it makes my heart ache.

638
00:21:46,424 --> 00:21:48,223
I know how you feel.

639
00:21:50,263 --> 00:21:51,664
This camera is only for me.

640
00:21:52,934 --> 00:21:55,464
- Hey, it's not for you.
- It's not for you.

641
00:21:55,464 --> 00:21:57,934
It's for all of us.
It's for a full shot.

642
00:21:57,934 --> 00:21:59,374
Jong Kook should be on the camera too.

643
00:21:59,374 --> 00:22:01,003
This is for a full shot. Lean back.

644
00:22:01,003 --> 00:22:02,204
We can be on the camera too.

645
00:22:02,204 --> 00:22:03,914
- Don't block the camera.
- She's right.

646
00:22:03,914 --> 00:22:05,043
My goodness.

647
00:22:05,043 --> 00:22:09,313
We're rewriting the production
objective for the year 2021.

648
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:12,884
So we prepared missions
that require a good hunch...

649
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:16,223
and good wit which are necessary
skills for Running Man.

650
00:22:16,823 --> 00:22:18,954
This is what I'm good at.

651
00:22:18,954 --> 00:22:20,154
I have a good hunch.

652
00:22:20,154 --> 00:22:21,793
Goofball is acting up again.

653
00:22:21,793 --> 00:22:23,634
- What are you good at?
- Goofball is acting up again.

654
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:25,293
I really want to see
you do something well.

655
00:22:25,293 --> 00:22:26,763
- A good hunch and what?
- I'm good at this.

656
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:28,904
I'm sure you will be covered
in a floury mess in 10 minutes.

657
00:22:28,904 --> 00:22:30,204
- Hey, stay quiet.
- I'm pretty sure.

658
00:22:30,273 --> 00:22:31,434
I can imagine that.

659
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:33,404
The first mission is...

660
00:22:33,404 --> 00:22:35,844
Know How It Feels to Run.

661
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:38,444
You will give it a try one by one.

662
00:22:38,644 --> 00:22:41,684
You will lie on the cart
and stamp your feet once...

663
00:22:41,743 --> 00:22:45,684
to get as close as possible to the wall.

664
00:22:45,684 --> 00:22:47,454
And you will see...

665
00:22:47,454 --> 00:22:50,253
the yellow zone, green
zone, and red zone here.

666
00:22:50,253 --> 00:22:52,993
- And the cart has an arrow.
- There's an arrow.

667
00:22:52,993 --> 00:22:56,094
If the arrow stops on red,
the water balloon will burst.

668
00:22:57,094 --> 00:22:58,964
If it stops on green, the
marble balloon will burst.

669
00:22:59,063 --> 00:23:00,434
If it stops on yellow, you succeed.

670
00:23:01,033 --> 00:23:03,733
If you fail to control the
speed and bump into the wall,

671
00:23:03,733 --> 00:23:05,073
the bell will ring,

672
00:23:05,174 --> 00:23:06,704
and the whipped cream
balloon will burst.

673
00:23:09,374 --> 00:23:10,674
That's the worst.

674
00:23:10,674 --> 00:23:12,444
It'd be better to try it later.

675
00:23:12,444 --> 00:23:14,944
- No.
- No. That's not true.

676
00:23:15,114 --> 00:23:16,444
Why are they being like that to me?

677
00:23:16,444 --> 00:23:17,813
- Why?
- You two should sit apart.

678
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,384
- But why?
- Just sit apart.

679
00:23:19,384 --> 00:23:21,624
Why do you think it'd
be better to try later?

680
00:23:21,624 --> 00:23:23,624
- That's not true.
- Why is that?

681
00:23:23,823 --> 00:23:25,094
What?

682
00:23:25,094 --> 00:23:26,454
I mean, I can see how
hard it should be...

683
00:23:26,454 --> 00:23:28,894
- Kim Grand Award. You're right.
- All right.

684
00:23:28,894 --> 00:23:31,194
- I know. Why would it be better?
- This is crazy.

685
00:23:31,194 --> 00:23:33,394
Only the 1st and 2nd places will...

686
00:23:33,394 --> 00:23:36,134
- get to spin the roulette.
- Only the 1st and 2nd places?

687
00:23:36,233 --> 00:23:38,733
- Okay.
- The order is important here.

688
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:39,833
Who will go first?

689
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,303
Seok Jin said he'd go first.

690
00:23:41,303 --> 00:23:42,674
- Really?
- When did I say that?

691
00:23:42,674 --> 00:23:44,844
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- He told me that.

692
00:23:44,844 --> 00:23:46,444
- When did I say that?
- Before we got in here.

693
00:23:46,444 --> 00:23:47,783
- When did I?
- You did.

694
00:23:47,783 --> 00:23:49,283
- I didn't say that.
- He said that.

695
00:23:49,444 --> 00:23:51,614
It would be disadvantageous
for me to go first.

696
00:23:51,614 --> 00:23:54,124
- Will you go first?
- Jam Hugh!

697
00:23:54,124 --> 00:23:55,354
Do I get any advantages?

698
00:23:55,424 --> 00:23:57,293
- Advantages?
- Any advantages?

699
00:23:57,654 --> 00:23:59,493
- I need something.
- Show us what to do.

700
00:23:59,493 --> 00:24:01,223
- You're the oldest one here.
- I'll go first then.

701
00:24:01,223 --> 00:24:02,664
- Okay.
- Are you serious?

702
00:24:02,664 --> 00:24:04,464
- Okay.
- Are you serious?

703
00:24:04,664 --> 00:24:05,733
He's cool.

704
00:24:05,733 --> 00:24:07,263
I will give you a chance to practice.

705
00:24:07,263 --> 00:24:08,503
- A chance to practice?
- Okay.

706
00:24:08,503 --> 00:24:09,604
I'll go first then.

707
00:24:09,604 --> 00:24:10,674
I'll do it.

708
00:24:11,473 --> 00:24:12,733
I want to go first.

709
00:24:14,344 --> 00:24:16,874
Hey, this is... It goes like this.

710
00:24:17,573 --> 00:24:19,573
- I get a practice round, right?
- Yes, you do.

711
00:24:19,644 --> 00:24:21,184
Let me push it back for you.

712
00:24:21,184 --> 00:24:22,283
Look at this.

713
00:24:22,783 --> 00:24:24,483
This is more sensitive than I thought.

714
00:24:24,513 --> 00:24:25,513
This is for practice.

715
00:24:25,513 --> 00:24:26,714
- It's a practice.
- You can practice it only once.

716
00:24:26,714 --> 00:24:27,753
Right.

717
00:24:30,523 --> 00:24:31,624
It's red.

718
00:24:31,624 --> 00:24:33,293
- It doesn't slide well.
- It's water.

719
00:24:35,063 --> 00:24:37,164
- It's red.
- You should push it hard.

720
00:24:37,164 --> 00:24:38,194
In this case, the water balloon bursts.

721
00:24:38,194 --> 00:24:40,134
If it were a real round, the
water balloon would've burst.

722
00:24:41,134 --> 00:24:42,634
Did you get the hang of it?

723
00:24:42,704 --> 00:24:43,733
He has no idea.

724
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,634
You should stop on yellow.

725
00:24:46,634 --> 00:24:47,704
Are you trying it now?

726
00:24:47,704 --> 00:24:49,104
No. I'll do it later.

727
00:24:49,444 --> 00:24:50,813
- Why?
- I'm not doing this.

728
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,374
- Why?
- You practiced it already.

729
00:24:52,374 --> 00:24:54,083
No. I'll do it later.

730
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:55,583
Why?

731
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:57,614
I think we should
decide the order again.

732
00:24:57,783 --> 00:24:59,013
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

733
00:24:59,214 --> 00:25:00,253
I'll go first.

734
00:25:00,253 --> 00:25:01,253
- Do you want to go first?
- Yes.

735
00:25:01,253 --> 00:25:02,783
- I knew it. He's Kim Grand Award.
- Kim Grand Award.

736
00:25:02,783 --> 00:25:04,323
Kim Grand Award steps up.

737
00:25:04,323 --> 00:25:06,354
He's setting a good example
after winning the Grand Award.

738
00:25:06,354 --> 00:25:08,194
A gangster to a Grand Award winner.

739
00:25:09,223 --> 00:25:10,563
He's "Protein Monster".

740
00:25:10,563 --> 00:25:12,434
He's the Grand Award winner indeed.

741
00:25:12,434 --> 00:25:13,964
His heart is like a soy sauce dish.

742
00:25:14,803 --> 00:25:16,904
- You're amazing.
- Since it's the new year,

743
00:25:16,904 --> 00:25:19,434
- You're the best.
- I should change my life pattern.

744
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:22,644
- I should stop waiting.
- That sounds good.

745
00:25:22,644 --> 00:25:23,844
So I should stop there.

746
00:25:24,013 --> 00:25:25,473
I can look at it, right?

747
00:25:25,473 --> 00:25:26,773
- You can practice once.
- Yes. This is a practice.

748
00:25:30,414 --> 00:25:32,414
- What was that?
- Why?

749
00:25:32,414 --> 00:25:34,223
- Soy sauce dish.
- Soy sauce dish.

750
00:25:34,223 --> 00:25:36,053
- Soy sauce dish.
- Soy sauce dish.

751
00:25:36,483 --> 00:25:37,624
The practice is over.

752
00:25:37,624 --> 00:25:38,854
- You should start now.
- Start.

753
00:25:38,854 --> 00:25:40,563
- You should start now.
- Here I go.

754
00:25:40,563 --> 00:25:41,723
Can I start?

755
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,094
- It should be twice as hard.
- It slows down quickly.

756
00:25:51,434 --> 00:25:52,434
It's water.

757
00:25:52,434 --> 00:25:54,043
- Is it marbles?
- Okay.

758
00:25:56,144 --> 00:25:57,473
This is the best one.

759
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:59,174
What was that? It wasn't so bad.

760
00:25:59,214 --> 00:26:01,013
It just feels bad.

761
00:26:01,114 --> 00:26:03,214
It just hurts your feelings.

762
00:26:03,214 --> 00:26:05,384
He did a good job though.

763
00:26:05,384 --> 00:26:06,654
- This is pretty.
- Okay.

764
00:26:06,654 --> 00:26:08,253
- Feel them.
- Didn't I succeed?

765
00:26:08,253 --> 00:26:09,553
- No.
- These are the marbles.

766
00:26:09,553 --> 00:26:11,023
Who's up next?

767
00:26:11,023 --> 00:26:12,523
- I'll go next.
- I'll go next.

768
00:26:13,023 --> 00:26:15,194
- I'll go next.
- I'll go next.

769
00:26:15,194 --> 00:26:17,694
I'm ready now, so I'll go first.

770
00:26:17,694 --> 00:26:19,533
You should stomp your feet hard.

771
00:26:19,533 --> 00:26:20,563
You're right.

772
00:26:20,563 --> 00:26:22,104
Jae Seok, you should start immediately.

773
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:25,134
- All right. Here I go.
- Let's go.

774
00:26:25,134 --> 00:26:27,104
Will he make it to the whipped cream?

775
00:26:27,104 --> 00:26:28,174
Let's go.

776
00:26:38,483 --> 00:26:39,753
Oh no.

777
00:26:41,253 --> 00:26:42,483
Oh no.

778
00:26:42,483 --> 00:26:43,993
Gosh, this is...

779
00:26:44,624 --> 00:26:45,753
What's that?

780
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:46,924
- Oh no.
- Gosh, this is...

781
00:26:48,164 --> 00:26:50,323
What's that?

782
00:26:52,394 --> 00:26:53,694
You pushed it too hard.

783
00:26:53,763 --> 00:26:54,964
What's that?

784
00:26:55,164 --> 00:26:56,634
You pushed it too hard.

785
00:26:58,233 --> 00:26:59,773
You can't do that already.

786
00:26:59,934 --> 00:27:01,904
What should the rest
of the members do now?

787
00:27:04,313 --> 00:27:06,273
- You can't do that already.
- Are you all right?

788
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:09,513
You shouldn't have pushed it too hard.

789
00:27:09,513 --> 00:27:10,884
It splattered all over.

790
00:27:10,884 --> 00:27:12,214
It was too hard.

791
00:27:12,884 --> 00:27:15,184
What should the rest
of the members do now?

792
00:27:15,184 --> 00:27:16,783
- Hey.
- You pushed it too hard.

793
00:27:16,783 --> 00:27:18,723
Didn't someone kick the cart?

794
00:27:18,723 --> 00:27:19,723
You pushed it too hard.

795
00:27:19,993 --> 00:27:21,424
You should've done it in moderation.

796
00:27:21,424 --> 00:27:23,164
I mean, I thought...

797
00:27:23,464 --> 00:27:25,594
I pushed it at the speed of Mach.

798
00:27:28,664 --> 00:27:30,934
- You just pushed it too hard.
- It exceeded the speed of sound.

799
00:27:32,573 --> 00:27:34,204
- It was fast, wasn't it?
- He's really strong.

800
00:27:34,204 --> 00:27:35,604
Didn't someone push it?

801
00:27:35,604 --> 00:27:37,743
- It just feels that way.
- You have strong legs.

802
00:27:38,144 --> 00:27:40,813
Gosh, I'm afraid to go next.

803
00:27:40,813 --> 00:27:41,813
Seok Jin.

804
00:27:41,884 --> 00:27:43,543
We shouldn't commit a foul anymore.

805
00:27:43,543 --> 00:27:45,354
- "Anymore"?
- We can't play the game this way.

806
00:27:45,354 --> 00:27:46,714
We can't play the game.

807
00:27:46,884 --> 00:27:48,954
- No one should stand close.
- We should play the game.

808
00:27:48,954 --> 00:27:51,293
I think someone kicked me.

809
00:27:51,293 --> 00:27:52,323
Me?

810
00:27:52,323 --> 00:27:53,553
Ji Hyo, did someone kick me?

811
00:27:53,553 --> 00:27:54,993
No. You just pushed it yourself.

812
00:27:54,993 --> 00:27:56,194
Is it just my feeling?

813
00:27:56,194 --> 00:27:58,134
- It's your feeling.
- You just feel that way.

814
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:59,263
I think someone kicked it.

815
00:27:59,263 --> 00:28:00,493
No, you pushed it too hard.

816
00:28:00,493 --> 00:28:01,763
- Really?
- It was really hard.

817
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,164
- Did I push it too hard?
- Yes.

818
00:28:03,364 --> 00:28:04,634
So you mean it's my fault.

819
00:28:05,174 --> 00:28:07,503
How many times do you have to ask that?

820
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:09,204
Next up is Seok Jin.

821
00:28:09,674 --> 00:28:11,874
I feel sad as I see
him lie down on here.

822
00:28:11,973 --> 00:28:13,674
Eternal youth.

823
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,043
I hope you live young forever.

824
00:28:15,043 --> 00:28:17,384
You need to kick a
little hard to succeed.

825
00:28:17,384 --> 00:28:18,753
- Okay. Got it.
- Okay.

826
00:28:19,184 --> 00:28:21,454
It's hard to reach the wall. See?

827
00:28:22,023 --> 00:28:24,194
It's hard to reach the wall. See?

828
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,023
Oh, no. That was so close.

829
00:28:31,694 --> 00:28:33,263
Oh, no. That was so close.

830
00:28:33,293 --> 00:28:34,563
He almost succeeded.

831
00:28:35,164 --> 00:28:36,404
He almost succeeded.

832
00:28:36,503 --> 00:28:38,204
He almost succeeded.

833
00:28:38,573 --> 00:28:40,674
- Is this how we'll play this game?
- Come on, Jae Seok.

834
00:28:40,674 --> 00:28:42,144
- Really?
- What's the point?

835
00:28:42,144 --> 00:28:43,144
I'll just volunteer to get
the whipped cream on my face.

836
00:28:43,144 --> 00:28:44,614
That's a shame.

837
00:28:44,614 --> 00:28:46,374
I didn't know it was a
downward slope from here.

838
00:28:46,374 --> 00:28:47,884
Oh, I think you're right.

839
00:28:47,884 --> 00:28:49,644
It must be sloped here.

840
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,384
- It's flat. Trust me.
- It seems...

841
00:28:51,384 --> 00:28:52,414
Did you push me?

842
00:28:52,414 --> 00:28:54,424
No, I didn't push you. I
was standing over here.

843
00:28:54,424 --> 00:28:56,654
- Really?
- You kicked too hard.

844
00:28:56,654 --> 00:28:57,654
Hold on. We can't...

845
00:28:57,654 --> 00:28:59,323
Let's all sit on the cart from now on.

846
00:28:59,323 --> 00:29:01,323
- Right. That's a good idea.
- Someone pushed me, right?

847
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:02,723
- Hey, someone...
- This isn't fair.

848
00:29:02,723 --> 00:29:04,434
- He did kick hard.
- Did someone push me?

849
00:29:04,434 --> 00:29:06,263
- No one pushed you.
- Seok Jin.

850
00:29:06,263 --> 00:29:07,634
- Are you sure?
- Sorry?

851
00:29:08,563 --> 00:29:10,303
- You kicked hard, Seok Jin.
- Did someone push me?

852
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,503
By the way, my hunch was right.

853
00:29:12,503 --> 00:29:14,473
I didn't know why, but
I wanted to go first.

854
00:29:14,473 --> 00:29:16,404
- Exactly.
- Isn't it strange?

855
00:29:16,604 --> 00:29:19,414
- Right? It's strange.
- He kicked too hard.

856
00:29:19,414 --> 00:29:21,344
Did no one push me? I
think someone pushed me.

857
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:23,483
I can't get mad because I'm not sure.

858
00:29:23,783 --> 00:29:25,614
Seok Jin, you never lose your temper.

859
00:29:25,614 --> 00:29:26,614
That's true.

860
00:29:26,753 --> 00:29:27,753
True.

861
00:29:27,753 --> 00:29:30,124
- He never gets angry. It's amazing.
- Exactly.

862
00:29:30,124 --> 00:29:31,694
- I wonder why.
- Why do you not feel anger?

863
00:29:31,694 --> 00:29:33,924
If I were him, I would've gotten
angry earlier at the opening.

864
00:29:34,864 --> 00:29:36,964
Seok Jin would never get
angry over things like that.

865
00:29:37,023 --> 00:29:38,263
- You see...
- He has a big heart.

866
00:29:38,263 --> 00:29:39,694
- It's not that I hold back...
- Let's keep provoking him.

867
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,364
- my anger. I don't feel anger.
- Let's make him angry.

868
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:42,533
He has such a big heart.

869
00:29:43,134 --> 00:29:44,874
He plays along with
any jokes. He's great.

870
00:29:44,874 --> 00:29:46,773
I would've thrown my
coat and made a scene.

871
00:29:46,773 --> 00:29:49,604
He's so cool. I would've
sworn harshly at everyone.

872
00:29:49,604 --> 00:29:51,414
- He's a man with good manners.
- Indeed.

873
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:52,743
- He really has a big heart.
- Absolutely.

874
00:29:52,743 --> 00:29:54,684
- You know I didn't get angry.
- Of course, we know.

875
00:29:54,684 --> 00:29:56,313
- I wasn't angry earlier.
- He's so cool.

876
00:29:56,313 --> 00:29:58,184
- Why would you swear?
- Why did you take it off?

877
00:29:58,253 --> 00:29:59,614
Why would you get mad?

878
00:30:02,253 --> 00:30:03,384
I just did it to make you laugh.

879
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,854
- I know.
- He should publish a book.

880
00:30:05,854 --> 00:30:07,964
- Are Seok Jin and Jae Seok out?
- Yes.

881
00:30:07,964 --> 00:30:09,763
- Hang on.
- Can't you give us another chance?

882
00:30:09,763 --> 00:30:11,464
It's because you guys
tried it in the beginning.

883
00:30:11,464 --> 00:30:12,664
You can give us a disadvantage instead.

884
00:30:12,664 --> 00:30:14,464
- Deduct our score, for example.
- Sit down, will you?

885
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:16,134
Jae Seok, we'll give you
another chance if you want.

886
00:30:16,134 --> 00:30:17,674
- I'll try again.
- Because there was cheating.

887
00:30:17,674 --> 00:30:19,003
Didn't anyone really do
anything when I tried it?

888
00:30:19,003 --> 00:30:20,333
- No.
- No one did anything.

889
00:30:21,204 --> 00:30:22,543
- Be honest with me.
- You should kick hard, Se Chan.

890
00:30:22,543 --> 00:30:23,704
Are you serious or what?

891
00:30:23,704 --> 00:30:25,114
Honestly, I'm not sure.

892
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,414
There wasn't cheating.

893
00:30:26,473 --> 00:30:28,043
I guess there was. There was cheating.

894
00:30:28,043 --> 00:30:29,344
I didn't see anything.

895
00:30:29,384 --> 00:30:32,354
If Bo Pil says he didn't
see it, he didn't see it.

896
00:30:32,454 --> 00:30:34,753
Next up is Song Jeoktoma.

897
00:30:34,753 --> 00:30:36,624
Here comes Song Jeoktoma.

898
00:30:37,223 --> 00:30:39,594
She said, "Here comes Song Jeoktoma."

899
00:30:40,223 --> 00:30:42,624
She called herself Song Jeoktoma.

900
00:30:42,624 --> 00:30:45,063
- That's good, Song Jeoktoma.
- She's so funny these days.

901
00:30:45,063 --> 00:30:47,934
- Song Jeoktoma, good job.
- Where? Here?

902
00:30:47,934 --> 00:30:49,934
Right, Song Jeoktoma. Let's go.

903
00:30:49,934 --> 00:30:52,204
Push it hard, Ji Hyo.

904
00:30:52,204 --> 00:30:53,934
- Hard? Should I push it hard?
- Yes.

905
00:30:53,934 --> 00:30:55,674
- Ji Hyo, this isn't a practice run.
- Okay.

906
00:30:57,043 --> 00:30:59,043
- Go, Song Jeoktoma!
- Ji Hyo, kick hard.

907
00:30:59,043 --> 00:31:01,513
- Here goes Song Jeoktoma.
- Kick hard.

908
00:31:07,053 --> 00:31:08,283
- Gosh.
- Oh, boy.

909
00:31:08,854 --> 00:31:10,124
She'll stop at the water
balloon. She's the first.

910
00:31:10,124 --> 00:31:11,154
She got the water balloon.

911
00:31:12,354 --> 00:31:13,354
Gosh.

912
00:31:13,854 --> 00:31:14,964
- Song Jeoktoma.
- It's a water balloon.

913
00:31:14,964 --> 00:31:16,194
It's a water balloon.

914
00:31:17,164 --> 00:31:18,533
- Hey, Song Jeoktoma.
- The water fell on her belly.

915
00:31:18,533 --> 00:31:19,664
- On her belly.
- That was funny.

916
00:31:19,664 --> 00:31:22,033
- Gosh. My belly...
- I told you to kick hard.

917
00:31:22,033 --> 00:31:23,704
- It fell on her belly.
- Song Jeoktoma.

918
00:31:23,733 --> 00:31:26,033
- It fell on her belly.
- It hit her belly.

919
00:31:26,033 --> 00:31:27,204
- It hit my belly.
- I know.

920
00:31:27,204 --> 00:31:28,674
- Did you hear the sound?
- Song Jeoktoma.

921
00:31:28,674 --> 00:31:30,043
It fell right on my belly.

922
00:31:31,174 --> 00:31:32,313
Good job.

923
00:31:33,374 --> 00:31:34,414
No way.

924
00:31:37,243 --> 00:31:38,313
Did he succeed?

925
00:31:38,483 --> 00:31:40,253
If Kwang Soo succeeds,

926
00:31:40,253 --> 00:31:42,223
the 1st and 2nd places may be changed.

927
00:31:43,954 --> 00:31:45,154
It feels...

928
00:31:46,094 --> 00:31:48,023
- Kwang Soo, go down a little.
- Go down.

929
00:31:48,023 --> 00:31:49,223
- Go down.
- A little more.

930
00:31:49,223 --> 00:31:50,993
Kwang Soo, go down. Go down.

931
00:31:51,763 --> 00:31:53,164
- Hey, stop it.
- Go down.

932
00:31:53,164 --> 00:31:54,733
- I'm just giving him a signal.
- That's enough.

933
00:31:54,733 --> 00:31:56,434
- I'm just giving him a signal.
- Stop it.

934
00:31:56,434 --> 00:31:58,233
- To tell him to go down.
- Stop it.

935
00:31:58,233 --> 00:31:59,773
- That's enough.
- Darn it.

936
00:31:59,773 --> 00:32:01,444
- Okay. You're almost there.
- Stop it.

937
00:32:01,444 --> 00:32:03,444
You're almost there. Okay.

938
00:32:03,444 --> 00:32:04,944
- Kwang Soo, come up a little.
- What?

939
00:32:04,944 --> 00:32:06,374
Move up a little.

940
00:32:06,944 --> 00:32:08,813
- Go back down.
- Gosh. What are you doing?

941
00:32:09,414 --> 00:32:12,053
- Go down.
- We're trying to help you.

942
00:32:12,053 --> 00:32:14,013
- So you won't hurt your head.
- Exactly.

943
00:32:14,013 --> 00:32:15,354
- They're helping you.
- You should trust us.

944
00:32:15,384 --> 00:32:17,154
- All right.
- Kick harder than you think.

945
00:32:17,154 --> 00:32:18,323
Whenever you're ready.

946
00:32:18,553 --> 00:32:20,694
- Trust me.
- Kwang Soo, kick hard.

947
00:32:21,793 --> 00:32:23,223
I have a feeling that he'll succeed.

948
00:32:23,223 --> 00:32:24,793
- Me too.
- I think he'll do a good job.

949
00:32:24,793 --> 00:32:25,894
You may begin.

950
00:32:26,894 --> 00:32:29,033
- That's good.
- Because he has long legs,

951
00:32:29,033 --> 00:32:30,104
he's at an advantage.

952
00:32:30,664 --> 00:32:33,033
Look at him. Because he has long legs...

953
00:32:33,033 --> 00:32:35,204
He looks so ugly. His face is annoying.

954
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:36,404
My gosh.

955
00:32:37,374 --> 00:32:40,214
Kwang Soo has a well-proportioned body.

956
00:32:52,523 --> 00:32:53,553
Goodbye.

957
00:32:58,864 --> 00:33:00,733
How could it fall right on his face?

958
00:33:00,733 --> 00:33:02,204
It fell right on the target.

959
00:33:02,204 --> 00:33:03,404
That was perfect.

960
00:33:03,664 --> 00:33:05,874
- It was placed in the right spot.
- Nice.

961
00:33:05,874 --> 00:33:07,204
- Good shot.
- Kwang Soo, go back to your seat.

962
00:33:07,204 --> 00:33:08,473
Good shot.

963
00:33:08,473 --> 00:33:09,874
You did such a great job, Kwang Soo.

964
00:33:09,874 --> 00:33:10,944
- Go on.
- I did that, right?

965
00:33:10,944 --> 00:33:13,414
- Yes. You did it perfectly.
- Yes. No one touched you.

966
00:33:13,414 --> 00:33:15,144
- I'm next.
- Now...

967
00:33:15,144 --> 00:33:16,743
Oh, right. Jae Seok
will try again. Okay.

968
00:33:16,743 --> 00:33:18,154
- Right.
- We'll give you another chance.

969
00:33:18,154 --> 00:33:19,783
- Of course.
- It wouldn't be fair.

970
00:33:19,783 --> 00:33:21,684
- We won't touch you.
- Right.

971
00:33:21,684 --> 00:33:23,124
He's a cool guy.

972
00:33:23,124 --> 00:33:25,523
Here. You should wear a nose clip.

973
00:33:25,523 --> 00:33:26,854
Hey, I don't need it.

974
00:33:26,854 --> 00:33:28,364
- Hey, that's okay.
- Really?

975
00:33:28,364 --> 00:33:30,624
- You're such a weakling.
- But if whipped cream...

976
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,164
- Stop it.
- Your nose will run.

977
00:33:32,164 --> 00:33:33,233
- Your nose will run.
- I don't care.

978
00:33:33,233 --> 00:33:34,533
Jae Seok, go down.

979
00:33:34,533 --> 00:33:35,934
- After the shoot, he'll say,
- Go down.

980
00:33:35,934 --> 00:33:38,204
- "The cream keeps coming out."
- Go down already.

981
00:33:38,204 --> 00:33:40,333
- Go down. Come on.
- Hurry up and go down.

982
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:41,743
- Go down. Put your head on it.
- Your head.

983
00:33:41,743 --> 00:33:43,503
- Go down more.
- A little more.

984
00:33:43,503 --> 00:33:44,944
- Okay.
- Good.

985
00:33:44,944 --> 00:33:46,644
- Okay.
- Watch me.

986
00:33:46,644 --> 00:33:48,043
- Are you ready?
- Go, Jae Seok.

987
00:33:48,043 --> 00:33:49,243
Show everyone your accuracy.

988
00:33:49,243 --> 00:33:51,954
- Watch how I do this.
- That's great.

989
00:33:51,954 --> 00:33:53,654
Let's go. Oh, my. He looks so skillful.

990
00:33:53,654 --> 00:33:55,354
- I think he's calculating.
- Watch me.

991
00:33:55,354 --> 00:33:57,624
- Watch me closely.
- Is he calculating?

992
00:33:57,624 --> 00:33:58,793
- Watch me.
- He's playing with the cart.

993
00:33:58,793 --> 00:34:00,694
- Watch this. Watch how I do this.
- He's playing with it.

994
00:34:00,694 --> 00:34:02,124
- Here he goes.
- Watch me.

995
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:04,563
Let's go. Bounce off of it. 1, 2, 3. Go.

996
00:34:04,563 --> 00:34:06,094
Here I go.

997
00:34:06,094 --> 00:34:07,904
Here I go.

998
00:34:08,934 --> 00:34:10,033
Here I go.

999
00:34:10,033 --> 00:34:13,003
- Come on.
- What's that, Jae Seok?

1000
00:34:13,003 --> 00:34:14,844
- Come on.
- That's disappointing.

1001
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,773
- Come on.
- That's disappointing.

1002
00:34:16,773 --> 00:34:18,414
- Gosh.
- Come on.

1003
00:34:18,644 --> 00:34:20,043
What's this? It's neither
funny nor impressive.

1004
00:34:20,043 --> 00:34:22,944
- That's disappointing.
- Try again.

1005
00:34:22,944 --> 00:34:24,884
- What was that?
- Gosh.

1006
00:34:24,884 --> 00:34:27,154
- He's the Grand Award winner.
- He said...

1007
00:34:27,154 --> 00:34:29,184
I focus solely on laugh.

1008
00:34:29,454 --> 00:34:30,483
I'm so disappointed.

1009
00:34:30,483 --> 00:34:32,394
- Neither whipped cream nor success.
- It's hard to get what you want.

1010
00:34:32,394 --> 00:34:33,553
It was boring.

1011
00:34:33,954 --> 00:34:36,124
Why did he have to try again
if he would make it so boring?

1012
00:34:36,263 --> 00:34:38,594
He's disappointed in himself.

1013
00:34:39,063 --> 00:34:41,163
- Gosh.
- I'm so upset right now.

1014
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:43,603
- Oh, man.
- It wasn't funny or impressive.

1015
00:34:43,603 --> 00:34:45,503
- Jae Seok failed.
- Is someone in there?

1016
00:34:45,503 --> 00:34:46,773
Bo Pil, edit this part out.

1017
00:34:49,143 --> 00:34:51,313
Gosh. That was disappointing.

1018
00:34:51,313 --> 00:34:53,244
I'll announce the result.

1019
00:34:53,244 --> 00:34:55,014
- Se Chan is in the first place.
- Oh, yes!

1020
00:34:55,014 --> 00:34:56,884
- Haha is in second place.
- All right!

1021
00:34:56,884 --> 00:34:59,214
Let's move to the next location
to continue the second mission.

1022
00:34:59,214 --> 00:35:01,453
- Okay.
- It was disappointing.

1023
00:35:03,324 --> 00:35:05,224
- Shall I call your stylist?
- Hey, can you...

1024
00:35:05,224 --> 00:35:08,663
Can you bring a fresh team uniform...

1025
00:35:08,793 --> 00:35:11,333
and a T-shirt to wear under it?

1026
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:14,063
Because it's wet. Hurry
up. Thank you. Okay.

1027
00:35:14,063 --> 00:35:16,034
- It's sticky.
- Do we have extra uniforms?

1028
00:35:16,034 --> 00:35:18,373
I'll call your stylist again
to tell her to come back.

1029
00:35:18,474 --> 00:35:20,304
- What did you say?
- Come again?

1030
00:35:20,304 --> 00:35:22,744
- Who pushed you?
- I heard that you pushed me.

1031
00:35:22,744 --> 00:35:24,643
- Yes, I pushed you at the end.
- I know.

1032
00:35:26,444 --> 00:35:27,614
Who pushed me? Was it Kwang Soo?

1033
00:35:27,614 --> 00:35:28,683
Yes, Kwang Soo did it.

1034
00:35:31,483 --> 00:35:33,514
It looks like your stylists...

1035
00:35:34,014 --> 00:35:36,353
stepped out together
and are coming back now.

1036
00:35:36,353 --> 00:35:38,853
- They'll be back in 5 minutes.
- 5 minutes?

1037
00:35:38,893 --> 00:35:41,163
- Really? We should wait then.
- Yes.

1038
00:35:44,324 --> 00:35:45,893
- I didn't know.
- I was surprised...

1039
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,864
Or would you like to
continue dressing like that?

1040
00:35:47,864 --> 00:35:49,134
Like this?

1041
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:52,733
Hey... My gosh.

1042
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,574
- I wouldn't mind, but...
- Don't they look pitiful?

1043
00:35:54,574 --> 00:35:56,574
- Hey!
- Don't we look awful?

1044
00:35:56,574 --> 00:35:59,143
- You guys look great.
- Wearing this stained shirt?

1045
00:35:59,143 --> 00:36:00,514
- But you look great in it.
- Answer me.

1046
00:36:00,514 --> 00:36:02,583
- My gosh. We...
- Then can I borrow a towel?

1047
00:36:02,583 --> 00:36:04,413
- To cover the neckline?
- Okay. All right. Let's do this.

1048
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:05,784
- You guys look great.
- Let's do this.

1049
00:36:05,784 --> 00:36:07,554
- You look great.
- Those shows you direct.

1050
00:36:07,753 --> 00:36:09,253
I'll see how successful they will be.

1051
00:36:09,253 --> 00:36:10,324
It's not like that.

1052
00:36:10,324 --> 00:36:11,853
You want me to be on the show
when it has yellow stains?

1053
00:36:11,853 --> 00:36:13,654
You're on Running Man, so
put on your running shirt.

1054
00:36:13,654 --> 00:36:15,424
- "Running Shirt Man".
- Gosh.

1055
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:17,163
- "Running Shirt Man".
- Did you throw up while lying down?

1056
00:36:17,893 --> 00:36:20,034
- Why is your shirt clean?
- The clothes are here.

1057
00:36:20,034 --> 00:36:21,103
They're here.

1058
00:36:21,103 --> 00:36:22,503
Where have you been?

1059
00:36:22,503 --> 00:36:24,404
- Why hasn't my stylist come yet?
- I brought you fresh clothes.

1060
00:36:24,404 --> 00:36:25,674
Where have you been?

1061
00:36:25,674 --> 00:36:26,703
I'm worried.

1062
00:36:26,703 --> 00:36:28,143
Could I be the only one
without fresh clothes?

1063
00:36:28,143 --> 00:36:29,344
Seok Jin, you should...

1064
00:36:29,344 --> 00:36:30,944
I'll change my clothes so
we can start the shoot.

1065
00:36:31,373 --> 00:36:33,214
- Wait.
- Run, Jae Seok.

1066
00:36:33,214 --> 00:36:35,643
Let's hurry up before
Seok Jin's stylist comes.

1067
00:36:35,643 --> 00:36:37,643
- Come on. Hurry up.
- Change your clothes.

1068
00:36:37,853 --> 00:36:39,813
- Hurry up and give me the shirt.
- I look like a beggar.

1069
00:36:40,384 --> 00:36:41,753
Let's hurry up.

1070
00:36:41,853 --> 00:36:44,324
I should hurry up to prevent Seok
Jin from changing his clothes.

1071
00:36:44,654 --> 00:36:45,853
This is driving me crazy.

1072
00:36:45,893 --> 00:36:47,654
- Hurry up!
- What did you do?

1073
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,793
- Hurry up!
- What did you do?

1074
00:36:51,364 --> 00:36:53,063
- Come here.
- Ji Hyo is in there?

1075
00:36:53,433 --> 00:36:54,764
What is wrong with you?

1076
00:36:54,764 --> 00:36:57,034
- Ji Hyo is in that room, Jae Seok.
- Gosh, Jae Seok.

1077
00:36:57,034 --> 00:36:58,603
Jae Seok, why did you come in?

1078
00:36:58,603 --> 00:37:00,433
- You're unbelievable.
- You startled me.

1079
00:37:00,433 --> 00:37:01,844
- What's wrong with you?
- Goofball.

1080
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:03,773
- Are you out of your mind?
- You punk!

1081
00:37:03,773 --> 00:37:05,514
- Beat him up!
- Come here.

1082
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:07,313
We should teach him a lesson.

1083
00:37:07,313 --> 00:37:08,813
- She had her clothes on.
- We'll punish you.

1084
00:37:09,244 --> 00:37:11,413
- Why did you do that?
- Playful Child.

1085
00:37:11,413 --> 00:37:13,313
- He screamed after a long time.
- I'm relieved, Ji Hyo.

1086
00:37:13,384 --> 00:37:14,784
- He startled me.
- Ji Hyo, I'm relieved.

1087
00:37:14,784 --> 00:37:16,953
- You startled me.
- She had finished changing clothes.

1088
00:37:16,953 --> 00:37:18,654
- Gosh, seriously.
- He hasn't screamed like that...

1089
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:21,194
- in a while.
- He screamed when he opened it.

1090
00:37:22,494 --> 00:37:24,264
- Hurry up!
- What did you do?

1091
00:37:25,634 --> 00:37:28,333
I was the one who should be
screaming, but he screamed.

1092
00:37:30,563 --> 00:37:33,404
- Gosh, Goofball.
- What is taking my stylist so long?

1093
00:37:33,904 --> 00:37:36,143
Seok Jin, why are you wearing a
cartridge belt during a shoot?

1094
00:37:36,143 --> 00:37:38,043
- Oh, this is...
- Let's begin the shoot.

1095
00:37:38,043 --> 00:37:40,773
- I need to change my clothes too.
- He's wearing a cartridge belt.

1096
00:37:42,143 --> 00:37:44,083
- Kwang Soo, isn't that my shirt?
- My stylist, where are you?

1097
00:37:44,313 --> 00:37:45,753
Look at Seok Jin.

1098
00:37:45,813 --> 00:37:47,514
Seok Jin, your uniform just arrived.

1099
00:37:48,453 --> 00:37:50,654
What is it? This is what I wore earlier.

1100
00:37:50,953 --> 00:37:52,324
- Just put it on.
- My stylist!

1101
00:37:52,324 --> 00:37:54,253
Just put it on, Seok Jin.
We'll begin the shoot now.

1102
00:37:54,253 --> 00:37:56,123
- Where are you, my stylist?
- Let's go.

1103
00:37:56,224 --> 00:37:57,964
- Where are you?
- Let's begin.

1104
00:37:57,964 --> 00:38:00,063
- Wait. I haven't changed...
- Good. The semi-real variety show.

1105
00:38:00,063 --> 00:38:01,233
- That's great.
- This is a semi-real variety show.

1106
00:38:01,233 --> 00:38:03,134
This is unfair. You guys
changed your clothes.

1107
00:38:03,134 --> 00:38:04,634
- That's why I told you to wear it.
- My stylist!

1108
00:38:05,003 --> 00:38:07,233
- The next mission is...
- Excuse me.

1109
00:38:07,233 --> 00:38:08,444
The next mission is...

1110
00:38:08,444 --> 00:38:10,143
Excuse me.

1111
00:38:10,344 --> 00:38:14,244
- Hey...
- The semi-real variety show!

1112
00:38:14,413 --> 00:38:15,983
- This...
- Seok Jin, wait.

1113
00:38:15,983 --> 00:38:17,344
- This is true entertainment.
- Nice.

1114
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,514
- Nicely done.
- Right?

1115
00:38:18,514 --> 00:38:19,714
This is of a similar color.

1116
00:38:20,114 --> 00:38:21,284
It's Chan Hee's.

1117
00:38:21,384 --> 00:38:22,884
- But...
- There you go.

1118
00:38:23,353 --> 00:38:24,424
Unbelievable.

1119
00:38:26,393 --> 00:38:27,753
I love it.

1120
00:38:27,753 --> 00:38:29,563
- But...
- I love it.

1121
00:38:29,623 --> 00:38:31,063
I look like an old man who lives alone.

1122
00:38:31,063 --> 00:38:32,134
I love it.

1123
00:38:32,134 --> 00:38:33,563
- Live forever, Seok Jin.
- Nice.

1124
00:38:33,634 --> 00:38:34,703
What's that?

1125
00:38:34,703 --> 00:38:35,703
- It suits you.
- Live forever, Seok Jin.

1126
00:38:35,703 --> 00:38:36,833
It suits him, doesn't it?

1127
00:38:36,864 --> 00:38:39,074
It's time to spin the
wheel for the first time.

1128
00:38:39,933 --> 00:38:43,174
Se Chan and Haha, you
will spin the wheel.

1129
00:38:43,744 --> 00:38:45,014
If the wheel...

1130
00:38:45,174 --> 00:38:47,913
lands on the section
labeled "swap name",

1131
00:38:47,913 --> 00:38:51,183
you'll swap others' names
for yours on the big wheel.

1132
00:38:52,054 --> 00:38:54,724
The one that says "absorb
all seven names"...

1133
00:38:54,724 --> 00:38:57,483
means that you can swap out
one of their names each...

1134
00:38:57,483 --> 00:38:58,623
for your own.

1135
00:38:58,893 --> 00:39:01,663
Land on "2 left and 2
right of the selected",

1136
00:39:01,724 --> 00:39:03,264
and you'll be able...

1137
00:39:03,264 --> 00:39:05,433
to swap the name in which
the big wheel lands on...

1138
00:39:05,433 --> 00:39:06,793
as well as 2 on its
left and 2 on its right.

1139
00:39:06,864 --> 00:39:09,833
Some will land you at
a disadvantage though.

1140
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:13,634
If you're told to add the
name of the worst member,

1141
00:39:13,873 --> 00:39:16,543
the worst member you
selected earlier today...

1142
00:39:16,804 --> 00:39:19,244
will have his or her
name replaced with yours.

1143
00:39:20,114 --> 00:39:21,714
Seok Jin, stop trying to look good.

1144
00:39:21,714 --> 00:39:23,643
- Wear it like you did earlier.
- Why?

1145
00:39:23,643 --> 00:39:24,683
Why did you make it look cool?

1146
00:39:24,683 --> 00:39:26,284
I had it on backward earlier.

1147
00:39:27,014 --> 00:39:28,753
The tag was on the outside.

1148
00:39:29,353 --> 00:39:30,483
- Gosh.
- Are you all right?

1149
00:39:30,753 --> 00:39:32,293
- Are you okay?
- No, and it's no thanks to you.

1150
00:39:32,924 --> 00:39:34,594
I can still smell the whipped cream.

1151
00:39:35,094 --> 00:39:36,324
You should just head home today.

1152
00:39:37,224 --> 00:39:38,433
I will if you do.

1153
00:39:38,764 --> 00:39:40,563
- Go home.
- Haha, you're up first.

1154
00:39:40,563 --> 00:39:41,663
Okay, let's do this.

1155
00:39:41,804 --> 00:39:42,904
- Here we go.
- Sure.

1156
00:39:49,744 --> 00:39:51,043
Let it be the worst one.

1157
00:39:52,944 --> 00:39:54,643
Okay, here we go.

1158
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:56,014
No way. Not that one.

1159
00:39:56,214 --> 00:39:57,313
No way. Not that one.

1160
00:39:57,313 --> 00:39:58,483
Is it mine?

1161
00:40:00,114 --> 00:40:01,983
Three slots in my name!

1162
00:40:04,483 --> 00:40:06,793
- How boring.
- Could it be more boring?

1163
00:40:06,793 --> 00:40:08,563
- He got one of the best ones.
- How bland.

1164
00:40:08,563 --> 00:40:10,063
Swap out the names of the ones you hate.

1165
00:40:10,063 --> 00:40:11,964
- You've gotten all boring.
- The one you hate.

1166
00:40:11,964 --> 00:40:13,594
Yes, the one I hate.

1167
00:40:14,134 --> 00:40:15,203
Why would that be me?

1168
00:40:15,203 --> 00:40:18,003
You called me Mr. Dirty Mustache.

1169
00:40:18,003 --> 00:40:20,174
- He's right.
- Darn it.

1170
00:40:20,174 --> 00:40:22,043
Mr. Dirty Mustache!

1171
00:40:22,043 --> 00:40:23,244
- Yes, take out Se Chan's name.
- Right.

1172
00:40:23,873 --> 00:40:25,913
- Take out Se Chan's name.
- He called me B-rated.

1173
00:40:26,014 --> 00:40:27,773
There's one over here.

1174
00:40:27,773 --> 00:40:29,543
- No, it's better over here.
- Of course.

1175
00:40:29,643 --> 00:40:31,983
- Why are you taking out my name?
- Of course, he should.

1176
00:40:32,014 --> 00:40:33,014
Se Chan, go!

1177
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,614
- Go.
- Let's go.

1178
00:40:34,924 --> 00:40:36,384
Nice!

1179
00:40:36,424 --> 00:40:37,853
Go round and round.

1180
00:40:38,893 --> 00:40:40,054
Land on the one with seven slots.

1181
00:40:40,054 --> 00:40:41,194
That's what you'd
expect from a comedian.

1182
00:40:41,563 --> 00:40:44,023
Go round and round.

1183
00:40:46,293 --> 00:40:47,393
Did you see that?

1184
00:40:47,393 --> 00:40:49,103
- He's just like Se Hyeong.
- You're more like Boom.

1185
00:40:50,163 --> 00:40:51,703
- No, not that one.
- Just one slot!

1186
00:40:54,304 --> 00:40:56,773
- No, not that one.
- Just one slot!

1187
00:40:56,773 --> 00:40:57,873
He only gets to change one slot.

1188
00:40:58,014 --> 00:41:00,413
- This is what I get for winning?
- Nice.

1189
00:41:00,413 --> 00:41:02,043
Take one of Haha's slots.

1190
00:41:02,284 --> 00:41:04,344
But it's better to have my name up here.

1191
00:41:04,344 --> 00:41:05,353
Why would you take my slot?

1192
00:41:05,353 --> 00:41:06,614
Of course, he should.

1193
00:41:06,614 --> 00:41:08,353
Seok Jin's the one you hate.

1194
00:41:08,353 --> 00:41:09,453
- Right.
- Take both off.

1195
00:41:09,453 --> 00:41:10,824
Why would you take my slot?

1196
00:41:10,824 --> 00:41:13,253
- Take Haha's.
- He has the most right now.

1197
00:41:13,523 --> 00:41:14,694
Haha has the most.

1198
00:41:14,694 --> 00:41:16,063
- Is this you being angry?
- Of course not.

1199
00:41:16,793 --> 00:41:18,233
"Of course not."

1200
00:41:18,433 --> 00:41:19,634
That was never the case.

1201
00:41:19,733 --> 00:41:20,933
- I'll take this one.
- That's the correct choice.

1202
00:41:20,933 --> 00:41:23,034
Don't listen to others
and go with your gut.

1203
00:41:23,034 --> 00:41:25,233
- Okay.
- All right. Nicely done.

1204
00:41:26,603 --> 00:41:28,003
- How are we supposed to sit?
- What's this?

1205
00:41:28,003 --> 00:41:29,304
We should sit in two rows.

1206
00:41:29,304 --> 00:41:30,873
Here's the last game.

1207
00:41:31,773 --> 00:41:33,444
Just like the previous games,

1208
00:41:33,444 --> 00:41:35,583
this one will require your wits,

1209
00:41:35,583 --> 00:41:37,643
your concentration, and gut feeling.

1210
00:41:37,643 --> 00:41:38,884
- Again?
- Concentration too?

1211
00:41:38,884 --> 00:41:40,654
This is the Joint Responsibility Quiz.

1212
00:41:40,654 --> 00:41:42,154
- Joint Responsibility Quiz?
- A quiz?

1213
00:41:42,154 --> 00:41:43,583
- A quiz?
- I'm doomed.

1214
00:41:43,853 --> 00:41:45,154
- Gosh...
- Okay!

1215
00:41:46,123 --> 00:41:47,554
- Hold on.
- All right!

1216
00:41:47,724 --> 00:41:49,523
Don't touch me.

1217
00:41:49,793 --> 00:41:51,634
I'll make him be more active.

1218
00:41:52,194 --> 00:41:53,264
Okay!

1219
00:41:53,264 --> 00:41:54,333
He's showing more excitement now.

1220
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:56,404
- That's the spirit.
- Let's do this.

1221
00:41:56,404 --> 00:41:58,333
None of this makes me angry.

1222
00:41:58,333 --> 00:41:59,574
- Okay!
- Get him excited.

1223
00:41:59,574 --> 00:42:01,574
- I'll get him to be more active.
- All right.

1224
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,603
Like this.

1225
00:42:09,384 --> 00:42:10,413
That tickles!

1226
00:42:10,413 --> 00:42:11,953
Seok Jin's loving it.

1227
00:42:12,784 --> 00:42:14,284
That tickles!

1228
00:42:15,753 --> 00:42:17,284
- There. You're all good.
- You can sit back up.

1229
00:42:17,353 --> 00:42:18,523
- You're to stay later on.
- All right.

1230
00:42:18,924 --> 00:42:20,694
Why are you only saying
that to me though?

1231
00:42:20,694 --> 00:42:21,893
Jong Kook can just go.

1232
00:42:21,893 --> 00:42:23,163
The last game...

1233
00:42:23,163 --> 00:42:25,563
will be played in groups of 2.

1234
00:42:25,563 --> 00:42:27,563
You and your partner will
answer the questions...

1235
00:42:27,764 --> 00:42:29,563
given by the staff.

1236
00:42:29,563 --> 00:42:31,233
Get it right and you'll earn 10 points.

1237
00:42:31,634 --> 00:42:34,103
The team with the highest
score will win this game...

1238
00:42:34,103 --> 00:42:35,143
and get a chance to spin the wheel.

1239
00:42:35,143 --> 00:42:37,074
I should at least get
a chance to spin it.

1240
00:42:37,074 --> 00:42:38,674
Team play is required, right?

1241
00:42:38,674 --> 00:42:39,873
So we must answer one each.

1242
00:42:39,873 --> 00:42:41,373
I won't be favored then.

1243
00:42:41,373 --> 00:42:43,014
You can't discuss with your partner,

1244
00:42:43,014 --> 00:42:44,214
so choose your partner wisely.

1245
00:42:44,953 --> 00:42:47,054
- We'll select the teams then.
- Sure.

1246
00:42:47,384 --> 00:42:48,953
We ranked you...

1247
00:42:48,953 --> 00:42:51,424
by how well you did on the quizzes...

1248
00:42:51,924 --> 00:42:53,523
throughout 2020 on Running Man.

1249
00:42:53,523 --> 00:42:54,753
- Really?
- You never know.

1250
00:42:54,753 --> 00:42:56,764
I'll reveal the ranking
starting from up top,

1251
00:42:57,063 --> 00:43:00,364
so raise your hand if you wish
to partner up with that person.

1252
00:43:00,364 --> 00:43:02,864
The person will choose who
he or she wants as a partner.

1253
00:43:02,864 --> 00:43:03,864
- Okay.
- Good.

1254
00:43:03,864 --> 00:43:05,804
Let me reveal who had the highest score.

1255
00:43:06,904 --> 00:43:08,304
I should raise my hand every time.

1256
00:43:08,304 --> 00:43:09,904
Getting the most answers
on quizzes in 2020 was...

1257
00:43:10,143 --> 00:43:11,273
It has to be Jae Seok.

1258
00:43:11,273 --> 00:43:13,214
Getting the most answers
on quizzes in 2020 is...

1259
00:43:13,773 --> 00:43:16,683
Do you know what hyeongseoljigong means?

1260
00:43:16,683 --> 00:43:17,844
Well...

1261
00:43:17,844 --> 00:43:19,554
Something complex...

1262
00:43:19,554 --> 00:43:20,853
An area!

1263
00:43:20,853 --> 00:43:23,523
He's demonstrating
hyeongseoljigong right now.

1264
00:43:24,483 --> 00:43:25,694
I mean...

1265
00:43:26,753 --> 00:43:28,494
1, 2, 3.

1266
00:43:28,494 --> 00:43:30,793
- Quail eggs.
- Being hungry!

1267
00:43:30,824 --> 00:43:32,534
Being hungry! Did you say quail eggs?

1268
00:43:32,563 --> 00:43:33,994
And you'll make it out alive.

1269
00:43:33,994 --> 00:43:35,404
Be a nutjob!

1270
00:43:36,003 --> 00:43:37,764
What's the name of the vice-president?

1271
00:43:37,764 --> 00:43:40,674
- Kamala Harris.
- Jeoktoma!

1272
00:43:42,373 --> 00:43:43,944
Getting the most answers
on quizzes in 2020 was...

1273
00:43:44,143 --> 00:43:45,244
It has to be Jae Seok.

1274
00:43:45,313 --> 00:43:46,413
- It's Yu Jae Seok.
- Okay.

1275
00:43:46,474 --> 00:43:47,474
Me!

1276
00:43:47,674 --> 00:43:48,714
- It's Yu Jae Seok.
- Okay.

1277
00:43:48,884 --> 00:43:50,014
Me!

1278
00:43:50,014 --> 00:43:51,284
Everyone raised their hand.

1279
00:43:51,284 --> 00:43:52,353
Seok Jin...

1280
00:43:52,353 --> 00:43:53,683
- Everyone raised their hand.
- Me.

1281
00:43:53,784 --> 00:43:54,784
Seok Jin...

1282
00:43:54,784 --> 00:43:55,953
Seok Jin reluctantly raised his hand.

1283
00:43:56,023 --> 00:43:57,853
Seok Jin raised his hand too late.

1284
00:43:57,853 --> 00:43:58,994
That can happen, you know.

1285
00:43:58,994 --> 00:44:00,123
He was late to raise his hand.

1286
00:44:00,123 --> 00:44:02,063
Seok Jin raised his hand late.

1287
00:44:02,063 --> 00:44:03,893
- That can happen, you know.
- It can't.

1288
00:44:03,893 --> 00:44:06,364
- Seok Jin, lower your hand.
- Lower it.

1289
00:44:06,733 --> 00:44:08,733
- Lower your hand.
- We all raised ours instantly.

1290
00:44:08,733 --> 00:44:10,034
I raised it before hearing your name.

1291
00:44:10,034 --> 00:44:11,233
Our team will be too hard to beat.

1292
00:44:11,233 --> 00:44:12,674
- We shouldn't team up.
- Exactly.

1293
00:44:12,674 --> 00:44:14,534
Jong Kook is on the smarter side,

1294
00:44:14,534 --> 00:44:15,703
- so we shouldn't team up.
- But...

1295
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:18,273
I'll probably win if I
team up with Jong Kook.

1296
00:44:18,474 --> 00:44:19,873
- That's a high possibility.
- We'll be unbeatable.

1297
00:44:19,873 --> 00:44:21,014
You should take him then.

1298
00:44:21,014 --> 00:44:22,313
- 1 or 2...
- It makes better sense.

1299
00:44:22,313 --> 00:44:24,344
Take me or Ms. Toma.

1300
00:44:24,344 --> 00:44:25,683
Ms. Toma or...

1301
00:44:25,683 --> 00:44:27,714
I should team up Ssaebssaeb,

1302
00:44:27,714 --> 00:44:29,623
- Ms. Toma, or...
- Kwang Soo.

1303
00:44:29,724 --> 00:44:31,453
- I'm not as bad as them.
- Or Haha.

1304
00:44:31,453 --> 00:44:32,953
- But...
- I'm not as bad as them.

1305
00:44:32,953 --> 00:44:34,424
There's also Haha.

1306
00:44:34,424 --> 00:44:35,864
- What about So Min?
- He's not as bad.

1307
00:44:35,864 --> 00:44:37,393
- And Haha.
- He's not as bad.

1308
00:44:37,393 --> 00:44:39,163
It'll be either Ssaebssaeb or Kwang Soo.

1309
00:44:39,163 --> 00:44:41,034
Kwang Soo isn't as bad,

1310
00:44:41,034 --> 00:44:43,003
- so take Empty Head.
- Empty Head?

1311
00:44:43,163 --> 00:44:44,464
- How cool of you.
- Empty!

1312
00:44:44,464 --> 00:44:45,904
I love your confidence.

1313
00:44:45,904 --> 00:44:48,034
Shouldn't you take me with you?

1314
00:44:48,034 --> 00:44:49,744
Team up with me,

1315
00:44:49,744 --> 00:44:51,404
and if I get to swap five slots...

1316
00:44:53,043 --> 00:44:54,344
Three?

1317
00:44:57,884 --> 00:44:59,284
Take Se Chan instead.

1318
00:44:59,353 --> 00:45:00,614
I was wrong just now.

1319
00:45:01,284 --> 00:45:02,784
Take Se Chan instead.

1320
00:45:02,784 --> 00:45:06,094
I need to take a short break.

1321
00:45:06,424 --> 00:45:07,554
I need to rest a bit.

1322
00:45:08,023 --> 00:45:09,864
Okay, raise your hand!

1323
00:45:09,864 --> 00:45:11,424
- 1, 2, 3.
- Me!

1324
00:45:11,424 --> 00:45:13,094
- I'll take Se Chan then.
- Okay!

1325
00:45:13,094 --> 00:45:14,563
Why didn't you raise your hand?

1326
00:45:14,594 --> 00:45:16,733
- Why can't you raise your hand?
- You should've raised it.

1327
00:45:16,733 --> 00:45:18,404
- Kwang Soo...
- Call me Kim Jong Kook.

1328
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:21,003
- I choose Se Chan.
- Okay.

1329
00:45:22,444 --> 00:45:23,674
I want to team up with Seok Jin.

1330
00:45:24,174 --> 00:45:25,373
- Okay.
- Okay, good.

1331
00:45:25,413 --> 00:45:26,744
I want to team up with Seok Jin too.

1332
00:45:26,744 --> 00:45:27,844
I want to team up with Seok Jin.

1333
00:45:27,844 --> 00:45:28,884
I want Seok Jin as my partner.

1334
00:45:28,944 --> 00:45:30,813
- I want to team up with Seok Jin.
- I want Seok Jin...

1335
00:45:30,813 --> 00:45:31,884
In second place...

1336
00:45:33,154 --> 00:45:34,183
is Jong Kook.

1337
00:45:35,724 --> 00:45:36,753
Why did you stand up?

1338
00:45:36,753 --> 00:45:38,623
Why on earth did you stand up?

1339
00:45:39,554 --> 00:45:40,924
- Sit back down.
- His legs must be numb.

1340
00:45:41,054 --> 00:45:43,364
I don't understand why you stood up.

1341
00:45:43,364 --> 00:45:44,594
Director Choi.

1342
00:45:44,594 --> 00:45:45,964
- Sit back down.
- Are you sure he's in second place?

1343
00:45:45,964 --> 00:45:47,833
We counted all of the questions.

1344
00:45:47,833 --> 00:45:49,833
- But...
- This is hilarious.

1345
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:51,264
Why did you stand up?

1346
00:45:51,773 --> 00:45:52,933
In third place...

1347
00:45:53,273 --> 00:45:54,474
- is So Min.
- What?

1348
00:45:54,474 --> 00:45:55,643
- I'm in third place?
- Really?

1349
00:45:55,643 --> 00:45:56,904
Are you sure you counted this correctly?

1350
00:45:56,904 --> 00:45:58,543
- I'm in third place?
- Are you kidding me?

1351
00:45:58,674 --> 00:46:00,074
- Me?
- Hold on.

1352
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,643
I remember her getting
a lot of them correct.

1353
00:46:01,813 --> 00:46:03,983
- Seok Jin's in fourth place.
- That's not so bad.

1354
00:46:03,983 --> 00:46:05,183
Haha's in fifth place.

1355
00:46:05,514 --> 00:46:06,913
In sixth place is Kwang Soo.

1356
00:46:07,483 --> 00:46:08,924
In seventh place is Ji Hyo.

1357
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:10,324
And in eighth place is Se Chan.

1358
00:46:10,324 --> 00:46:12,054
Why? I already knew.

1359
00:46:12,054 --> 00:46:13,293
Se Chan's in eighth place?

1360
00:46:13,293 --> 00:46:14,724
Jae Seok, isn't it obvious?

1361
00:46:14,724 --> 00:46:16,424
Don't pretend to be okay with this.

1362
00:46:16,494 --> 00:46:18,224
- What do you mean? I'm fine.
- You're upset with the result.

1363
00:46:18,224 --> 00:46:19,933
Why am I in third place though?

1364
00:46:20,364 --> 00:46:21,833
- I...
- Se Chan, my gosh.

1365
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:24,534
- I...
- So raise your hand if you want...

1366
00:46:24,534 --> 00:46:26,003
to team up with Jong Kook.

1367
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,404
If you want to team up with Jong Kook.

1368
00:46:29,174 --> 00:46:31,273
- Because...
- Teaming up with me though...

1369
00:46:31,273 --> 00:46:32,643
- Seok Jin.
- We'll be a tough team to beat.

1370
00:46:32,643 --> 00:46:33,744
Don't choose those of a higher ranking.

1371
00:46:33,744 --> 00:46:34,773
Come on.

1372
00:46:34,873 --> 00:46:37,444
He's right. Don't choose
anyone of a higher ranking.

1373
00:46:37,483 --> 00:46:39,253
- Then...
- Choose someone in the bottom.

1374
00:46:39,253 --> 00:46:41,313
The one in third place
should give others a chance.

1375
00:46:41,514 --> 00:46:42,784
- I'll swap for you.
- Hold on.

1376
00:46:42,784 --> 00:46:44,054
- Choose one of these two.
- Exactly.

1377
00:46:44,054 --> 00:46:45,324
Either Kwang Soo or Ji Hyo.

1378
00:46:45,324 --> 00:46:46,824
These two are my only choice?

1379
00:46:46,824 --> 00:46:47,824
Kwang Soo or Ji Hyo.

1380
00:46:48,523 --> 00:46:50,424
Choosing Ji Hyo will humiliate me.

1381
00:46:50,424 --> 00:46:51,964
Jong Kook, I got Jeoktoma right.

1382
00:46:52,333 --> 00:46:53,994
Jong Kook, I got Jeoktoma right.

1383
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:55,433
- Jeoktoma?
- Jeoktoma!

1384
00:46:55,534 --> 00:46:57,163
That's what you're bragging about?

1385
00:46:57,163 --> 00:46:58,373
- Why can't I?
- "I got Jeoktoma right."

1386
00:46:58,373 --> 00:47:00,503
That happened weeks ago though.

1387
00:47:00,904 --> 00:47:02,244
Team up with Mr. Mullet.

1388
00:47:02,244 --> 00:47:03,844
- Okay, I'll take him.
- Okay!

1389
00:47:04,143 --> 00:47:05,143
It's a good choice.

1390
00:47:05,143 --> 00:47:08,074
Please put on your
vests and sit in rows.

1391
00:47:08,643 --> 00:47:09,683
All right.

1392
00:47:09,683 --> 00:47:10,813
- Let's go.
- All right.

1393
00:47:10,813 --> 00:47:12,284
Out of the many categories,

1394
00:47:12,284 --> 00:47:14,583
- I'll reveal the first one.
- Sure.

1395
00:47:15,054 --> 00:47:16,253
The first...

1396
00:47:16,483 --> 00:47:18,494
- will be the song quiz.
- Yes!

1397
00:47:18,494 --> 00:47:20,023
- I love quizzes like these.
- You're good at this, right?

1398
00:47:20,023 --> 00:47:21,094
Yes, I am.

1399
00:47:21,094 --> 00:47:23,724
- I'll count on you then.
- Two songs will play...

1400
00:47:23,964 --> 00:47:27,233
and you will name the artists
and titles respectively.

1401
00:47:27,694 --> 00:47:31,063
You will hear three seconds
of the first song's intro...

1402
00:47:31,663 --> 00:47:33,634
and then three seconds of
the second song's outro.

1403
00:47:34,233 --> 00:47:35,804
- The outro of the second song?
- Yes.

1404
00:47:35,804 --> 00:47:37,804
The intro and outro will be...

1405
00:47:37,804 --> 00:47:38,974
from two different songs.

1406
00:47:38,974 --> 00:47:40,614
When you say that you'll answer,

1407
00:47:40,614 --> 00:47:43,344
I'll choose the one who'll answer first.

1408
00:47:43,344 --> 00:47:44,514
- Randomly?
- Yes.

1409
00:47:44,514 --> 00:47:46,514
You will name the two songs...

1410
00:47:46,514 --> 00:47:48,083
- in that order.
- Okay.

1411
00:47:48,183 --> 00:47:49,483
Artist or title?

1412
00:47:49,483 --> 00:47:50,724
The first one is to name the first song.

1413
00:47:50,724 --> 00:47:52,054
What's this?

1414
00:47:52,324 --> 00:47:53,724
- It must have a purpose.
- It seems that way.

1415
00:47:54,953 --> 00:47:55,994
We don't know...

1416
00:47:55,994 --> 00:47:57,094
- who he'll pick first.
- All right!

1417
00:47:57,094 --> 00:47:58,123
The first song must be named first.

1418
00:47:58,123 --> 00:48:00,534
Here's the first song.

1419
00:48:02,603 --> 00:48:03,603
Cue.

1420
00:48:06,203 --> 00:48:07,474
- Let me answer!
- Okay.

1421
00:48:13,714 --> 00:48:14,974
- I don't know the second song.
- Let me answer.

1422
00:48:14,974 --> 00:48:16,083
Ji Hyo.

1423
00:48:16,514 --> 00:48:18,143
"Beautiful Restriction" by Kim Jong Seo.

1424
00:48:18,384 --> 00:48:20,583
PSY's... You know, this dance...

1425
00:48:20,583 --> 00:48:21,953
- Wrong.
- Let me answer.

1426
00:48:21,953 --> 00:48:23,384
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

1427
00:48:23,384 --> 00:48:25,083
- We were faster.
- Let me answer.

1428
00:48:25,083 --> 00:48:26,154
What's the song title, Ji Hyo?

1429
00:48:26,154 --> 00:48:27,724
- We were faster.
- Let me answer.

1430
00:48:27,994 --> 00:48:29,694
"Beautiful Restriction" by Kim Jong Seo.

1431
00:48:29,694 --> 00:48:30,893
"New Face" by PSY.

1432
00:48:31,094 --> 00:48:32,694
- Let me answer.
- Wrong? Really?

1433
00:48:32,694 --> 00:48:34,094
"New Face" by PSY.

1434
00:48:34,194 --> 00:48:35,764
- Let me answer.
- Wrong? Really?

1435
00:48:35,764 --> 00:48:37,304
"Gangnam Style" by PSY.

1436
00:48:37,663 --> 00:48:39,233
- Let me answer.
- Wrong?

1437
00:48:39,233 --> 00:48:41,674
"Gangnam Style" by PSY.

1438
00:48:41,674 --> 00:48:43,344
- Kim... You said the wrong one.
- Let me answer.

1439
00:48:43,344 --> 00:48:44,804
"Beautiful Restriction" by Kim Jong Seo.

1440
00:48:44,804 --> 00:48:46,214
- Let me answer.
- You said the wrong one.

1441
00:48:46,273 --> 00:48:47,773
"Beautiful Restriction" by Kim Jong Seo.

1442
00:48:47,813 --> 00:48:49,384
PSY's "Gangnam Style".

1443
00:48:49,514 --> 00:48:50,543
- No?
- Let me answer.

1444
00:48:50,543 --> 00:48:51,983
Is the first song wrong?
No, I'm sure it's the one.

1445
00:48:51,983 --> 00:48:53,583
No. We all got the first song right.

1446
00:48:54,284 --> 00:48:55,353
We got it right.

1447
00:49:02,464 --> 00:49:03,764
The song was so popular.

1448
00:49:05,194 --> 00:49:07,464
We used to sing this song
whenever we went to a club.

1449
00:49:07,764 --> 00:49:08,964
- We sang it so many times.
- Hold on.

1450
00:49:08,964 --> 00:49:11,103
- The song ends like that.
- Exactly.

1451
00:49:11,103 --> 00:49:12,634
- We danced to the song too.
- Yes, we did.

1452
00:49:12,634 --> 00:49:13,804
- That's why.
- A strange woman

1453
00:49:13,804 --> 00:49:16,003
- I think it's PSY's "New Face".
- I think so too.

1454
00:49:22,313 --> 00:49:23,913
- Let me answer.
- Isn't it "Gangnam Style"?

1455
00:49:23,913 --> 00:49:24,913
Haha, you go first.

1456
00:49:24,913 --> 00:49:26,353
PSY's "Face".

1457
00:49:26,353 --> 00:49:27,413
- What?
- What's that song?

1458
00:49:27,413 --> 00:49:28,884
You should've said Kim Jong Seo's song.

1459
00:49:28,884 --> 00:49:30,453
- Is it an old song?
- Let me answer.

1460
00:49:30,453 --> 00:49:31,853
"Beautiful Restriction" by Kim Jong Seo.

1461
00:49:32,023 --> 00:49:34,224
PSY's...

1462
00:49:34,293 --> 00:49:35,724
- "Hwitturu Matturu".
- "Hwitturu..." Gosh.

1463
00:49:36,694 --> 00:49:37,893
Let me answer.

1464
00:49:38,264 --> 00:49:40,264
- "Hwitturu Matturu".
- "Hwitturu..." Gosh.

1465
00:49:40,293 --> 00:49:41,333
Let me answer.

1466
00:49:41,333 --> 00:49:42,464
- Hey.
- Wait.

1467
00:49:42,534 --> 00:49:43,663
Let me answer.

1468
00:49:45,034 --> 00:49:46,373
"Beautiful Restriction" by Kim Jong Seo.

1469
00:49:46,373 --> 00:49:48,373
What's the point when I
don't know the second song?

1470
00:49:48,373 --> 00:49:49,444
Can we hear it again?

1471
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:51,174
- Let's hear it again.
- We need to hear it again.

1472
00:49:51,344 --> 00:49:53,413
- Can we hear it again?
- Let's hear it again.

1473
00:49:53,413 --> 00:49:54,913
- We need to hear it again.
- PSY's "Gentleman".

1474
00:49:54,913 --> 00:49:56,014
Yes, we should.

1475
00:49:56,014 --> 00:49:57,083
- No.
- This is driving me nuts.

1476
00:50:02,523 --> 00:50:03,924
- I think it's the correct answer.
- Jae Seok.

1477
00:50:04,483 --> 00:50:05,654
Let me answer.

1478
00:50:06,324 --> 00:50:07,594
- Jae Seok.
- I heard off-beats.

1479
00:50:07,793 --> 00:50:08,893
Let me answer.

1480
00:50:09,094 --> 00:50:10,464
Do you know the answer? Let me answer.

1481
00:50:10,464 --> 00:50:11,563
Se Chan goes first.

1482
00:50:11,563 --> 00:50:12,893
"Beautiful Restriction" by Kim Jong Seo.

1483
00:50:12,893 --> 00:50:14,364
PSY's "New Face".

1484
00:50:14,563 --> 00:50:16,134
PSY's "New Face".

1485
00:50:16,733 --> 00:50:17,833
What are you doing?

1486
00:50:17,833 --> 00:50:19,634
Why did you even raise your hand
when you didn't know the answer?

1487
00:50:19,634 --> 00:50:21,503
How many times did they tell
us it wasn't the answer?

1488
00:50:21,503 --> 00:50:23,444
- Why did you do that?
- Why did you say the same song?

1489
00:50:23,444 --> 00:50:24,474
If you didn't know the answer...

1490
00:50:24,474 --> 00:50:26,474
They already told us
it wasn't the answer.

1491
00:50:26,474 --> 00:50:27,944
I thought you knew the second song.

1492
00:50:27,944 --> 00:50:29,384
- But he let me answer first.
- Hey.

1493
00:50:29,384 --> 00:50:31,483
I still think it's the correct answer.

1494
00:50:31,483 --> 00:50:33,083
- Try to guess the song.
- I have no idea.

1495
00:50:33,083 --> 00:50:34,114
It has been changed.

1496
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:35,253
- What are you two doing?
- They're discussing.

1497
00:50:35,253 --> 00:50:36,324
That's not allowed.

1498
00:50:36,353 --> 00:50:37,884
- What are you two doing?
- They're discussing.

1499
00:50:38,353 --> 00:50:39,924
- You shouldn't do that.
- Is it not allowed?

1500
00:50:39,924 --> 00:50:41,523
- Hey, what are you doing nay?
- You knew that.

1501
00:50:41,654 --> 00:50:42,764
"What are you doing nay?"

1502
00:50:42,864 --> 00:50:44,464
- Hey, what are you doing nay?
- You knew that.

1503
00:50:44,464 --> 00:50:45,594
"What are you doing nay?"

1504
00:50:45,594 --> 00:50:47,933
- "What are you doing nay?"
- I mean, what are you doing now?

1505
00:50:48,264 --> 00:50:49,804
- Pardon?
- You must've lost your mind.

1506
00:50:50,364 --> 00:50:51,464
- "You must've lost your mind"?
- What did you say?

1507
00:50:51,603 --> 00:50:52,733
Don't be disrespectful
to your senior comedian.

1508
00:50:52,733 --> 00:50:54,203
- Why would you...
- You were whispering to each other.

1509
00:50:54,203 --> 00:50:56,244
- Why would you speak thoughtlessly?
- I didn't speak thoughtlessly.

1510
00:50:56,244 --> 00:50:57,944
Seok Jin, you've crossed the line.

1511
00:50:57,944 --> 00:50:58,944
How dare you?

1512
00:50:58,944 --> 00:51:00,474
Seok Jin, you've crossed the line.

1513
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:01,474
How dare you?

1514
00:51:03,284 --> 00:51:04,884
- He played with my glasses.
- Come here.

1515
00:51:04,884 --> 00:51:06,813
I hate it the most.
How dare you do that?

1516
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:08,824
- You've crossed the line.
- I hate it the most.

1517
00:51:08,824 --> 00:51:09,924
- Is that so?
- How could you...

1518
00:51:11,023 --> 00:51:12,694
- If you...
- Please sit down.

1519
00:51:13,054 --> 00:51:15,494
- You lose points if you discuss.
- I was so surprised.

1520
00:51:15,494 --> 00:51:17,364
- They shouldn't get to answer.
- Let me answer.

1521
00:51:17,364 --> 00:51:19,634
From now on, if any team
gets caught discussing,

1522
00:51:19,634 --> 00:51:20,733
- the team will lose points.
- Understood.

1523
00:51:20,733 --> 00:51:22,264
We're not allowed to whisper
to each other in any case?

1524
00:51:22,264 --> 00:51:23,464
- Correct.
- Let's just say it out loud.

1525
00:51:23,464 --> 00:51:24,764
It's obvious.

1526
00:51:24,764 --> 00:51:26,404
You really shouldn't do that.

1527
00:51:26,703 --> 00:51:28,074
- Here goes Level Four.
- I'll go first.

1528
00:51:28,074 --> 00:51:30,043
- You should.
- He picks the one to go first.

1529
00:51:33,313 --> 00:51:34,373
Let me answer.

1530
00:51:34,773 --> 00:51:35,844
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

1531
00:51:35,844 --> 00:51:37,413
- Let me answer.
- Kwang Soo, you go first.

1532
00:51:37,413 --> 00:51:38,813
- But we were faster.
- Kwang Soo, you go first.

1533
00:51:38,813 --> 00:51:40,054
- Me?
- Yes.

1534
00:51:40,214 --> 00:51:42,023
- 3, 2,
- Kim Jong Seo's...

1535
00:51:42,023 --> 00:51:43,054
One.

1536
00:51:43,054 --> 00:51:44,123
- Okay.
- "Beautiful Restriction".

1537
00:51:44,123 --> 00:51:45,183
Let me answer.

1538
00:51:45,594 --> 00:51:46,924
Okay. Jae Seok, you go first.

1539
00:51:46,924 --> 00:51:48,253
"Beautiful Restriction" by Kim Jong Seo.

1540
00:51:48,253 --> 00:51:49,563
"Up and Down" by EXID.

1541
00:51:49,724 --> 00:51:50,994
- Okay!
- Okay!

1542
00:51:50,994 --> 00:51:52,094
Let's get ready to dance.

1543
00:51:56,264 --> 00:51:57,464
Gosh. Hey.

1544
00:51:57,703 --> 00:51:59,233
- That's not how they dance.
- What is this?

1545
00:51:59,233 --> 00:52:00,904
- This is...
- What is this?

1546
00:52:00,904 --> 00:52:02,503
- What is this?
- That's not how they dance.

1547
00:52:02,503 --> 00:52:04,503
It sounded like "New Face" earlier.

1548
00:52:05,574 --> 00:52:07,413
This is their dance move.

1549
00:52:18,583 --> 00:52:19,623
He's annoying.

1550
00:52:20,623 --> 00:52:21,753
Gosh, I'm so upset.

1551
00:52:21,753 --> 00:52:23,194
Gosh. He's so...

1552
00:52:23,194 --> 00:52:25,293
- That was good. Great.
- We did great.

1553
00:52:26,864 --> 00:52:28,034
Up, down, up, up, and down

1554
00:52:28,034 --> 00:52:29,933
I thought it was "Like a Cat" by AOA.

1555
00:52:30,103 --> 00:52:32,174
Here goes the second question.

1556
00:52:32,174 --> 00:52:33,433
Aren't there any common
knowledge questions?

1557
00:52:33,433 --> 00:52:34,904
- Level 1 of the 2nd question.
- Here we go.

1558
00:52:34,904 --> 00:52:36,174
I love this game. It's fun.

1559
00:52:41,444 --> 00:52:42,844
- I love this game. It's fun.
- Let's do this.

1560
00:52:45,583 --> 00:52:46,654
Let me answer.

1561
00:52:47,253 --> 00:52:49,623
- Jong Kook, you go first.
- I know the first song.

1562
00:52:49,623 --> 00:52:50,853
Sharp's...

1563
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,793
3, 2, 1.

1564
00:52:52,793 --> 00:52:54,194
- Let me answer.
- I don't know the second song.

1565
00:52:55,424 --> 00:52:57,023
- Okay.
- Jae Seok first.

1566
00:52:57,094 --> 00:52:58,464
"Tell Me, Tell Me" by Sharp.

1567
00:53:01,964 --> 00:53:03,304
- I don't know the second one.
- Let me answer.

1568
00:53:03,304 --> 00:53:04,634
- Gosh. That startled me.
- What's this?

1569
00:53:05,304 --> 00:53:07,333
- Gosh. That startled me.
- What's this?

1570
00:53:07,333 --> 00:53:08,474
- What's that?
- Let me answer.

1571
00:53:08,474 --> 00:53:09,543
- I don't know the second song.
- What's that?

1572
00:53:09,543 --> 00:53:11,103
- Gosh. That startled me.
- What's this?

1573
00:53:11,103 --> 00:53:12,344
- What's going on?
- What is that?

1574
00:53:14,344 --> 00:53:15,413
- Happy birthday
- What's this?

1575
00:53:16,813 --> 00:53:17,844
- To you
- Wait.

1576
00:53:17,844 --> 00:53:19,083
Is there something inside the balloon?

1577
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:20,453
- What is it?
- That was so sudden.

1578
00:53:23,154 --> 00:53:24,284
Is there something inside the balloon?

1579
00:53:24,353 --> 00:53:26,194
- What is it?
- That was so sudden.

1580
00:53:26,393 --> 00:53:27,424
He found something inside of it.

1581
00:53:27,623 --> 00:53:29,163
There's something in the balloons.

1582
00:53:29,163 --> 00:53:30,663
- He found something inside.
- What is it?

1583
00:53:30,663 --> 00:53:31,793
What is it? What is this for?

1584
00:53:31,893 --> 00:53:34,063
- What is this for?
- Can we just stick it in there?

1585
00:53:35,433 --> 00:53:36,703
- The singer and the song title?
- What is this?

1586
00:53:36,703 --> 00:53:38,464
- The first one...
- What's this?

1587
00:53:38,464 --> 00:53:39,503
The 1st one should say the 1st song.

1588
00:53:39,503 --> 00:53:41,233
- It must have a purpose.
- You're right.

1589
00:53:41,273 --> 00:53:43,203
- What is this for?
- Can we just stick it in there?

1590
00:53:43,373 --> 00:53:44,744
Hey, wait. Wait.

1591
00:53:44,744 --> 00:53:46,043
- What is it?
- Just stick it in.

1592
00:53:46,043 --> 00:53:48,214
- What is it?
- What is this?

1593
00:53:48,413 --> 00:53:49,913
It doesn't fit in the slot. Come on.

1594
00:53:50,014 --> 00:53:51,444
What? It doesn't fit in the slot.

1595
00:53:51,444 --> 00:53:53,083
I think we got the wrong swords.

1596
00:53:53,083 --> 00:53:54,253
There are real swords too.

1597
00:53:54,253 --> 00:53:56,154
See? I popped the balloon
as soon as it fell.

1598
00:53:56,424 --> 00:53:57,724
- I'm sure it's the right one.
- Right.

1599
00:54:00,994 --> 00:54:02,023
- What is it?
- What is this for?

1600
00:54:02,023 --> 00:54:04,324
It doesn't fit in the slot. I
think we got the wrong swords.

1601
00:54:04,464 --> 00:54:06,293
- I popped it right away.
- It's a real one.

1602
00:54:06,293 --> 00:54:07,393
- I'm sure it's the right one.
- Right.

1603
00:54:07,393 --> 00:54:08,804
- You can't try several times.
- You can do it just once.

1604
00:54:08,804 --> 00:54:09,933
You have just one chance.

1605
00:54:09,933 --> 00:54:11,433
I thought... I found one...

1606
00:54:11,433 --> 00:54:13,333
- I didn't know... I thought...
- It doesn't fit, right?

1607
00:54:13,433 --> 00:54:14,804
- You have just one chance.
- Does yours fit in the slot?

1608
00:54:15,304 --> 00:54:17,003
- Does it fit?
- It doesn't fit, right?

1609
00:54:17,304 --> 00:54:18,813
It fits in the slot.

1610
00:54:18,813 --> 00:54:20,474
Okay. Stop it. Hey, you punk.

1611
00:54:20,474 --> 00:54:21,674
- Gosh, seriously.
- Gosh, you.

1612
00:54:21,674 --> 00:54:23,114
Okay. Stop it. Hey, you punk.

1613
00:54:23,114 --> 00:54:24,483
- Gosh, seriously.
- Gosh, you.

1614
00:54:25,554 --> 00:54:26,784
You little...

1615
00:54:26,784 --> 00:54:28,154
- I'll stick mine in it.
- Okay.

1616
00:54:28,154 --> 00:54:29,654
If it pops out, do I get something?

1617
00:54:29,654 --> 00:54:30,753
Then you'll win.

1618
00:54:30,753 --> 00:54:31,824
Stick it in and see what happens.

1619
00:54:32,253 --> 00:54:33,953
- Do we get a hint?
- Maybe there's a hint.

1620
00:54:33,953 --> 00:54:35,324
Please. Please come out.

1621
00:54:35,424 --> 00:54:37,194
- Please.
- Maybe there's a hint.

1622
00:54:38,194 --> 00:54:39,293
Will it pop out?

1623
00:54:41,994 --> 00:54:43,733
It won't pop out anyway.
Just get it over with.

1624
00:54:43,733 --> 00:54:45,304
- Please pop out.
- He's right.

1625
00:54:45,304 --> 00:54:47,233
- We didn't put in many swords.
- So this is how it works.

1626
00:54:47,333 --> 00:54:48,773
- Gosh.
- I told you so.

1627
00:54:48,773 --> 00:54:51,143
So we need to stick a real
sword in the right slot.

1628
00:54:51,304 --> 00:54:52,614
The person who makes
it pop out will win.

1629
00:54:52,614 --> 00:54:54,214
- Okay.
- The quiz doesn't matter.

1630
00:54:55,273 --> 00:54:58,643
- They tricked us.
- This is so difficult.

1631
00:54:58,643 --> 00:55:01,183
You get 10 points when
you get 1 question right,

1632
00:55:01,183 --> 00:55:03,483
and you get 50 points
when the pirate pops out.

1633
00:55:03,724 --> 00:55:05,154
This is a faster way to win.

1634
00:55:05,623 --> 00:55:07,424
Oh, boy. I should find out
what the second song is.

1635
00:55:07,424 --> 00:55:08,753
- Now,
- They must be waiting upstairs.

1636
00:55:08,753 --> 00:55:11,063
we'll play Level Two.

1637
00:55:11,063 --> 00:55:12,733
Wait. I'm sorry.

1638
00:55:12,994 --> 00:55:14,733
- I think someone just farted.
- What?

1639
00:55:15,464 --> 00:55:17,163
- Why are you looking at me?
- Gosh, Seok Jin.

1640
00:55:17,163 --> 00:55:18,503
- Why are you looking at me?
- Hang on a second.

1641
00:55:18,733 --> 00:55:20,233
It can't be just a fart.

1642
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:21,634
Do you have a diaper by any chance?

1643
00:55:21,773 --> 00:55:22,844
I'm serious.

1644
00:55:22,844 --> 00:55:24,373
- I mean...
- You guys...

1645
00:55:24,373 --> 00:55:27,214
- Due to extreme nervousness...
- You guys...

1646
00:55:27,214 --> 00:55:28,983
- He must be embarrassed.
- He was laughing to hide it.

1647
00:55:28,983 --> 00:55:30,643
- Honestly, I don't think...
- Don't try to set me up.

1648
00:55:30,643 --> 00:55:31,913
- it was you.
- Okay.

1649
00:55:31,913 --> 00:55:33,983
The breeze is coming from that side.

1650
00:55:34,554 --> 00:55:35,753
It wasn't me.

1651
00:55:36,183 --> 00:55:37,924
- Was it really not you?
- No.

1652
00:55:38,023 --> 00:55:39,293
- What are you doing?
- Gosh.

1653
00:55:39,293 --> 00:55:40,324
It wasn't me.

1654
00:55:40,324 --> 00:55:42,563
- What are you doing?
- Gosh.

1655
00:55:43,123 --> 00:55:44,694
- Ji Hyo, what's wrong with you?
- I didn't do it.

1656
00:55:44,694 --> 00:55:46,833
You've been saying I smell bad
since last week, but it wasn't me.

1657
00:55:46,833 --> 00:55:48,063
- It wasn't you?
- Trust me. I didn't do it.

1658
00:55:48,063 --> 00:55:50,063
By the way, you've become
so good at improvising.

1659
00:55:50,063 --> 00:55:51,103
It wasn't me.

1660
00:55:53,174 --> 00:55:56,203
Let's move on. Play the music.

1661
00:56:04,014 --> 00:56:05,083
Let me answer.

1662
00:56:05,583 --> 00:56:06,654
- Kwang Soo first.
- All right.

1663
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:07,913
- This must be the correct answer.
- I know this song.

1664
00:56:08,214 --> 00:56:09,284
Kwang Soo first.

1665
00:56:09,284 --> 00:56:10,424
- This must be the correct answer.
- I know this song.

1666
00:56:10,424 --> 00:56:12,324
- I know this song too.
- I listen to it very often.

1667
00:56:12,324 --> 00:56:13,523
"Tell Me, Tell Me" by Sharp.

1668
00:56:13,523 --> 00:56:14,853
"One Man" by Kim Jong Kook.

1669
00:56:14,853 --> 00:56:16,264
Okay!

1670
00:56:16,264 --> 00:56:17,694
- This is...
- I can't believe this.

1671
00:56:17,694 --> 00:56:19,194
- This is unfair.
- I recognized it right away.

1672
00:56:19,194 --> 00:56:20,194
I did great, right?

1673
00:56:27,833 --> 00:56:28,904
Thank you.

1674
00:56:36,413 --> 00:56:38,643
- You can't play his song.
- He's right.

1675
00:56:38,643 --> 00:56:39,884
What's wrong with playing my song?

1676
00:56:39,884 --> 00:56:42,384
- Play my song too. "I Know".
- What's wrong with it?

1677
00:56:42,384 --> 00:56:43,784
It was advantageous for him.

1678
00:56:43,784 --> 00:56:45,893
Your song wasn't a hit
song, but mine was.

1679
00:56:45,893 --> 00:56:47,853
- What does that have to do with it?
- No wonder it sounded familiar.

1680
00:56:48,023 --> 00:56:49,094
Exactly.

1681
00:56:50,623 --> 00:56:51,793
Exactly.

1682
00:56:55,094 --> 00:56:57,034
Darn. It's a fake sword.

1683
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:05,813
Darn. It's a fake sword.

1684
00:57:06,873 --> 00:57:08,983
Darn. It's a fake sword.

1685
00:57:09,784 --> 00:57:11,344
- It's a fake one too.
- Hey, why did you do that?

1686
00:57:12,014 --> 00:57:13,284
You punk!

1687
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:16,023
- It's a fake one.
- Is it a fake sword?

1688
00:57:16,284 --> 00:57:18,023
- I didn't find any.
- Like I said,

1689
00:57:18,023 --> 00:57:20,424
don't get too excited when
you find a sword. Okay. Good.

1690
00:57:20,424 --> 00:57:21,623
This is a fake sword, right?

1691
00:57:21,623 --> 00:57:22,724
It didn't pop out.

1692
00:57:22,724 --> 00:57:24,424
She stuck it right into the slot.

1693
00:57:27,293 --> 00:57:28,964
I did it. I made it pop out.

1694
00:57:28,964 --> 00:57:30,233
- We made it.
- This is unfair.

1695
00:57:30,233 --> 00:57:32,333
- I'm so excited.
- This is so pointless.

1696
00:57:32,333 --> 00:57:33,974
It's not bad.

1697
00:57:33,974 --> 00:57:35,134
We're doing all right.

1698
00:57:35,134 --> 00:57:36,244
We won 50 points.

1699
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,444
- Nice.
- Oh, man.

1700
00:57:37,574 --> 00:57:39,074
Let's take our time.

1701
00:57:39,074 --> 00:57:40,174
Song Jeoktoma is the best.

1702
00:57:40,174 --> 00:57:41,714
- What a shame.
- Song Jeoktoma made it.

1703
00:57:41,714 --> 00:57:43,714
You see, this is like dog training.

1704
00:57:43,784 --> 00:57:45,543
I can't help but look up.

1705
00:57:45,813 --> 00:57:48,083
Just like Pavlov's dogs drooled
when they heard the bell ringing.

1706
00:57:48,083 --> 00:57:49,183
- Like dog training.
- It'd be funny...

1707
00:57:49,183 --> 00:57:50,583
if they throw balloons in front of us.

1708
00:57:50,853 --> 00:57:53,393
I don't understand.
What was the point...

1709
00:57:53,393 --> 00:57:55,864
of ranking us for our quiz?

1710
00:57:56,224 --> 00:57:57,663
It's pointless.

1711
00:57:57,663 --> 00:57:59,893
You didn't choose him
for the quiz anyway.

1712
00:58:00,563 --> 00:58:01,663
Jae Seok.

1713
00:58:01,893 --> 00:58:03,163
You chose me for the quiz, right?

1714
00:58:03,163 --> 00:58:04,233
- Of course.
- Thank you.

1715
00:58:04,233 --> 00:58:05,603
We won a lot of points
thanks to the game.

1716
00:58:08,974 --> 00:58:11,074
Please sit down. You're
blocking Kwang Soo.

1717
00:58:11,373 --> 00:58:12,974
Was he hidden from view all this time?

1718
00:58:13,413 --> 00:58:14,873
- I didn't know.
- Sit up straight.

1719
00:58:14,873 --> 00:58:16,614
No wonder. I couldn't see anything.

1720
00:58:16,614 --> 00:58:18,543
Kwang Soo is better suited
for group shots anyway.

1721
00:58:18,543 --> 00:58:19,583
Come on!

1722
00:58:19,853 --> 00:58:21,714
There's no such thing.

1723
00:58:22,424 --> 00:58:24,253
Here comes the next quiz.

1724
00:58:24,324 --> 00:58:25,683
Play the music.

1725
00:58:36,134 --> 00:58:38,003
- Hang on.
- I know the first one.

1726
00:58:38,134 --> 00:58:39,304
Then answer it.

1727
00:58:42,873 --> 00:58:44,744
I'm not sure about the
first song. Hold on.

1728
00:58:44,944 --> 00:58:46,074
Can you play it longer?

1729
00:58:46,643 --> 00:58:49,514
Level three. Play the music.

1730
00:58:55,953 --> 00:58:57,583
I know this song!

1731
00:58:58,253 --> 00:58:59,554
You do? I know the second song.

1732
00:58:59,554 --> 00:59:01,353
- I know the song.
- All right. I know the second song.

1733
00:59:01,353 --> 00:59:02,964
- I know the 2nd song too.
- I know the 2nd song too.

1734
00:59:02,964 --> 00:59:04,324
- You know the 2nd one?
- We got the 2nd song.

1735
00:59:04,424 --> 00:59:05,523
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

1736
00:59:06,194 --> 00:59:07,964
"I Have a Girlfriend" by Park Jin Young.

1737
00:59:09,134 --> 00:59:10,404
- "A Winter Story" by DJ DOC.
- Let me answer!

1738
00:59:10,404 --> 00:59:11,964
- "A Winter Story"?
- Let me answer. I was faster, no?

1739
00:59:11,964 --> 00:59:13,034
Go ahead, Jong Kook.

1740
00:59:13,034 --> 00:59:16,043
"I Have a Girlfriend" by Park Jin Young.

1741
00:59:16,074 --> 00:59:17,674
"Eve's Warning" by Park Mi Kyung.

1742
00:59:17,674 --> 00:59:19,174
That's not it. Let me answer!

1743
00:59:19,244 --> 00:59:21,174
- Park Jin...
- Haha, go first.

1744
00:59:21,174 --> 00:59:24,014
Park Jin Young's "That House Is Mine".

1745
00:59:24,014 --> 00:59:25,014
Let me answer.

1746
00:59:25,244 --> 00:59:26,913
- What kind of song is that?
- "My House Is Yours".

1747
00:59:26,913 --> 00:59:28,813
- Let me answer.
- I thought he knew.

1748
00:59:28,813 --> 00:59:30,554
- "Your Baby Is Mine Too".
- Two...

1749
00:59:30,705 --> 00:59:32,824
- Let me answer!
- Se Chan, go first.

1750
00:59:32,849 --> 00:59:34,619
- You'll all be surprised.
- Hurry up.

1751
00:59:34,619 --> 00:59:36,349
- 5, 4, 3,
- It's Rain's...

1752
00:59:36,349 --> 00:59:37,548
- 2, 1.
- "How to Avoid the Sun".

1753
00:59:37,548 --> 00:59:38,619
- 3, 2, 1.
- Let me answer.

1754
00:59:40,359 --> 00:59:41,726
I know this song!

1755
00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:44,191
You do? I know the second song.

1756
00:59:44,305 --> 00:59:46,424
- Let me answer!
- Se Chan, go first.

1757
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:48,219
- You'll all be surprised.
- Hurry up.

1758
00:59:48,219 --> 00:59:49,949
- 5, 4, 3,
- It's Rain's...

1759
00:59:49,949 --> 00:59:51,148
- 2, 1.
- "How to Avoid the Sun".

1760
00:59:51,148 --> 00:59:52,219
- 3, 2, 1.
- Let me answer.

1761
00:59:52,219 --> 00:59:53,458
"Eve's Warning" by Park Mi Kyung.

1762
00:59:53,458 --> 00:59:55,659
- That's it! Jae Seok!
- You gave them too much time.

1763
00:59:55,659 --> 00:59:57,789
- They were too slow!
- That was fantastic.

1764
00:59:57,814 --> 00:59:59,014
Come on.

1765
01:00:02,628 --> 01:00:05,168
Don't throw the balloons just
yet! Watch our performance first.

1766
01:00:05,168 --> 01:00:06,498
Don't throw the balloons just yet!

1767
01:00:06,498 --> 01:00:08,469
Watch our performance first.

1768
01:00:11,469 --> 01:00:12,739
Give them to us now!

1769
01:00:13,179 --> 01:00:15,731
- Watch us, Seok Jin.
- Throw them now!

1770
01:00:16,735 --> 01:00:18,379
- Throw them now!
- Watch us, Seok Jin.

1771
01:00:19,978 --> 01:00:22,219
- Gosh.
- That one was...

1772
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:25,018
- Seriously.
- You counted for too long.

1773
01:00:25,018 --> 01:00:27,989
- Give us a break.
- You're playing favorites.

1774
01:00:27,989 --> 01:00:30,029
- Don't count the second one.
- We didn't discuss at all.

1775
01:00:30,029 --> 01:00:31,858
- Let's not count it. It's absurd.
- You went too easy on them.

1776
01:00:31,858 --> 01:00:33,628
- Don't count it.
- Who didn't know the answer?

1777
01:00:33,628 --> 01:00:35,128
Then let's have the Grand Award
winners play rock-paper-scissors.

1778
01:00:35,213 --> 01:00:36,344
- With whom?
- The Grand Award winners.

1779
01:00:36,369 --> 01:00:38,668
Gosh, you want me to play
rock-paper-scissors with him?

1780
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:40,869
So if I win against Jong Kook,
everything will be settled?

1781
01:00:40,869 --> 01:00:42,498
That's not it. Listen.

1782
01:00:42,498 --> 01:00:44,239
If Jong Kook loses, let's
not argue against it anymore.

1783
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:45,469
- Okay.
- Make sure to win, Jae Seok.

1784
01:00:45,469 --> 01:00:46,838
- All right. Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1785
01:00:46,838 --> 01:00:48,409
- All right!
- It's the best of three.

1786
01:00:48,409 --> 01:00:50,279
- Come on! Stop it!
- We lined up behind him.

1787
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:51,779
- All right!
- It's the best of three.

1788
01:00:51,779 --> 01:00:53,679
- Come on! Stop it!
- We lined up behind him.

1789
01:00:53,679 --> 01:00:54,748
- Stop it.
- He said they lined up.

1790
01:00:54,779 --> 01:00:56,148
We even lined up!

1791
01:00:56,148 --> 01:00:57,949
- Goodness.
- Yangsebari, come here.

1792
01:00:57,949 --> 01:00:58,989
Yangsebari, come here.

1793
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:00,659
- At least two people should play.
- I'm sorry,

1794
01:01:00,659 --> 01:01:02,489
- but did you win the Grand Award?
- No...

1795
01:01:02,489 --> 01:01:04,228
- Then he's not qualified to play.
- That's not it.

1796
01:01:04,228 --> 01:01:05,228
He's just a research subject.

1797
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:06,728
I'm one to get vaccinated first.

1798
01:01:06,728 --> 01:01:07,929
You're the first one to get vaccinated?

1799
01:01:07,929 --> 01:01:09,768
- If you want to play, come closer.
- You have to win one more round.

1800
01:01:09,768 --> 01:01:10,869
If you want to play, come closer.

1801
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:12,199
- If you want to play, come closer.
- You have to win one more round.

1802
01:01:12,199 --> 01:01:13,869
- Why do you want to play it?
- You must come closer.

1803
01:01:13,869 --> 01:01:15,568
Why do you suddenly want to
play rock-paper-scissors?

1804
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:17,039
Come closer if you want to play.

1805
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:18,469
- Just play one more round for him!
- I mean...

1806
01:01:18,469 --> 01:01:20,239
- If you want to play...
- Come this way.

1807
01:01:20,239 --> 01:01:22,139
- I mean, if you want to play...
- If you want to play, come closer.

1808
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:24,378
If you want to play, swallow
your pride and come closer.

1809
01:01:24,378 --> 01:01:25,978
I'm going to you.

1810
01:01:25,978 --> 01:01:27,179
If you want to play, follow us.

1811
01:01:27,349 --> 01:01:28,949
- He can win it, you know.
- It's so funny...

1812
01:01:28,949 --> 01:01:30,188
- He can win it.
- Seok Jin is following them.

1813
01:01:30,289 --> 01:01:31,389
- Let's play it.
- Okay.

1814
01:01:31,389 --> 01:01:32,449
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1815
01:01:32,449 --> 01:01:34,958
- All right, I won. I won!
- Darn it.

1816
01:01:35,759 --> 01:01:37,529
He lost. Goodness.

1817
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:38,958
All right, I won against him.

1818
01:01:38,958 --> 01:01:40,759
- He even threw away his pride.
- How annoying.

1819
01:01:40,759 --> 01:01:42,559
The protruding mouth
brothers are getting ahead!

1820
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:43,969
- Okay.
- Just give it to them.

1821
01:01:43,969 --> 01:01:46,329
- But this is absurd.
- Just give it to them.

1822
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:48,239
- Here come the next quiz.
- Okay.

1823
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:49,498
Kwang Soo, you have to
listen to the rules.

1824
01:01:49,498 --> 01:01:51,239
Kwang Soo, you're in
charge of the balloons.

1825
01:01:51,239 --> 01:01:52,668
- Okay.
- This time,

1826
01:01:52,668 --> 01:01:54,279
you'll be playing the Guess Who Quiz.

1827
01:01:54,579 --> 01:01:57,079
We'll show you a picture
of a foreign celebrity.

1828
01:01:57,079 --> 01:01:58,648
You'll have to guess their full name.

1829
01:01:58,648 --> 01:01:59,779
- Gosh, this is...
- Okay.

1830
01:01:59,779 --> 01:02:01,148
You have to take turns
saying syllable by syllable.

1831
01:02:01,148 --> 01:02:02,378
We have to say the syllables?

1832
01:02:02,648 --> 01:02:04,748
For instance, if I tell
Haha to go first...

1833
01:02:06,018 --> 01:02:07,259
That's how you should say the answer.

1834
01:02:09,259 --> 01:02:11,128
You have to take turns
saying syllable by syllable.

1835
01:02:11,128 --> 01:02:12,458
We have to say the syllables?

1836
01:02:12,458 --> 01:02:13,858
For instance, if I tell
Haha to go first...

1837
01:02:13,858 --> 01:02:16,099
Let's catch the balloons instead.

1838
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:17,628
- Gosh, this is hard.
- It is.

1839
01:02:17,628 --> 01:02:19,568
- We have to say the full name?
- Yes, that's right.

1840
01:02:19,568 --> 01:02:21,398
- We excluded the middle name.
- Okay.

1841
01:02:21,398 --> 01:02:23,268
- There's a middle name too?
- Yes.

1842
01:02:23,268 --> 01:02:24,639
There's a middle name too?

1843
01:02:24,909 --> 01:02:27,179
- Okay.
- Here comes the first question.

1844
01:02:27,179 --> 01:02:29,378
If you call your answer,
I'll tell whom to go first.

1845
01:02:29,378 --> 01:02:30,949
Then you'll have to say
the syllables right away.

1846
01:02:30,949 --> 01:02:32,478
- Say it right away.
- We have to call to answer first.

1847
01:02:32,478 --> 01:02:33,779
- I'll do that.
- Let's begin.

1848
01:02:39,518 --> 01:02:41,559
- Let me answer!
- Go ahead, Haha.

1849
01:02:41,759 --> 01:02:42,759
- You know who he is.
- Mister...

1850
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:44,029
- Let me answer!
- Go ahead, Jae Seok.

1851
01:02:44,029 --> 01:02:45,228
- Jo.
- E.

1852
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:47,029
- Let me answer!
- Go ahead, Kwang Soo.

1853
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:48,259
- Joe.
- B.

1854
01:02:48,259 --> 01:02:49,259
- Kwang Soo.
- Ji.

1855
01:02:49,259 --> 01:02:50,628
- Darn it!
- Let me answer!

1856
01:02:50,628 --> 01:02:51,929
Go ahead, Se Chan.

1857
01:02:51,929 --> 01:02:53,099
- Joe.
- B.

1858
01:02:53,099 --> 01:02:54,539
- I.
- Den.

1859
01:02:54,768 --> 01:02:55,838
Darn it, you punk!

1860
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:57,739
- We stole their answer!
- Darn it!

1861
01:02:57,739 --> 01:03:00,978
- It's Joe Biden!
- "Joe Ji"?

1862
01:03:01,409 --> 01:03:02,838
"Joe Ji"?

1863
01:03:02,838 --> 01:03:03,878
"Joe Ji".

1864
01:03:04,108 --> 01:03:05,878
- What's happening? We missed them.
- What's happening?

1865
01:03:05,878 --> 01:03:07,349
- Darn it.
- That's our target.

1866
01:03:07,349 --> 01:03:08,748
- That's ours!
- Did you get them?

1867
01:03:10,518 --> 01:03:13,018
- Kwang Soo, we got it.
- What was that?

1868
01:03:13,018 --> 01:03:14,858
- Have you lost your mind?
- We got it.

1869
01:03:14,858 --> 01:03:17,389
- Give them to me. Hand it over.
- No.

1870
01:03:20,958 --> 01:03:23,099
- Okay.
- Kwang Soo got the chance.

1871
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:24,398
He even used his teeth.

1872
01:03:24,568 --> 01:03:25,969
- Hold on.
- Hey, we got it.

1873
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:27,369
Who put their hands in my underwear?

1874
01:03:27,798 --> 01:03:29,268
Someone hit me from behind
regardless of the balloons.

1875
01:03:29,268 --> 01:03:30,768
We have to give it a try. Hand me one.

1876
01:03:30,768 --> 01:03:32,668
It was already over.
Why did they hit me?

1877
01:03:33,179 --> 01:03:35,409
Gosh, how unlucky of me.

1878
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:37,579
- Are you upset right now?
- No, I am not upset.

1879
01:03:37,579 --> 01:03:40,548
I forgive you for not getting Joe Biden.

1880
01:03:40,548 --> 01:03:41,619
- I got this for us.
- Yes, you did.

1881
01:03:41,619 --> 01:03:42,818
- I forgive you.
- The pirate will pop up.

1882
01:03:42,818 --> 01:03:45,018
It's a relief that you're
contributing to our team.

1883
01:03:45,018 --> 01:03:46,048
- All right.
- This is worth 50 points.

1884
01:03:46,048 --> 01:03:47,159
- You can stick one in.
- Okay.

1885
01:03:47,219 --> 01:03:49,159
I forgive you for not getting Joe Biden.

1886
01:03:49,189 --> 01:03:51,603
- Gosh.
- I think it will pop up.

1887
01:03:51,628 --> 01:03:53,128
- You have one, right? Let's go.
- Yes, I have one.

1888
01:03:53,128 --> 01:03:54,458
- It'll be a relief if they fail.
- Give it a go.

1889
01:03:54,458 --> 01:03:55,759
Go ahead, trust your gut.

1890
01:03:55,759 --> 01:03:57,668
- Have you forgotten who you are?
- No, I'll give it a go.

1891
01:03:57,668 --> 01:03:59,099
You're Lee Kwang Soo,
for goodness' sake.

1892
01:03:59,099 --> 01:04:00,498
I should've caught one.

1893
01:04:00,498 --> 01:04:01,838
Just stick one in indifferently.

1894
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,568
He's timid with things like this.

1895
01:04:03,568 --> 01:04:05,469
- That's it. Just stick one in.
- He has no luck with it.

1896
01:04:05,469 --> 01:04:07,679
- Just stick it in.
- It didn't pop up! Okay!

1897
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:09,949
- Darn it.
- That was...

1898
01:04:10,309 --> 01:04:12,679
- That was cheap of you.
- Let's go, Kwang Soo.

1899
01:04:12,679 --> 01:04:13,918
- All right.
- I'll catch the next one.

1900
01:04:13,918 --> 01:04:15,079
- Let's move on.
- This is too much.

1901
01:04:15,079 --> 01:04:16,748
- Well done.
- This is too hard.

1902
01:04:16,748 --> 01:04:18,449
I... We...

1903
01:04:19,248 --> 01:04:21,619
I knew he was Biden, but I didn't
know his last name was Joe.

1904
01:04:21,719 --> 01:04:23,018
We weren't in a good position
to catch the balloons.

1905
01:04:23,018 --> 01:04:24,858
Hey, his last name is not Joe.

1906
01:04:24,858 --> 01:04:25,958
There's no such last name as Joe.

1907
01:04:25,958 --> 01:04:28,099
Then what about Joe?
His last name is Biden?

1908
01:04:28,099 --> 01:04:30,498
Then is Michael Jordan's last name "Ma"?

1909
01:04:30,869 --> 01:04:31,869
Do you even know who he is?

1910
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:33,068
Do you even watch the news?

1911
01:04:33,068 --> 01:04:34,068
- I mean...
- Then is his name Biden Joe?

1912
01:04:34,068 --> 01:04:35,469
I know he's the president of the US.

1913
01:04:35,469 --> 01:04:37,469
- That's right.
- He's the president-elect.

1914
01:04:37,469 --> 01:04:38,739
You all know who Joe Biden is, right?

1915
01:04:38,739 --> 01:04:41,978
I knew who he was, but I didn't
know his last name was Joe.

1916
01:04:42,409 --> 01:04:44,279
I didn't know his last name was Joe.

1917
01:04:44,279 --> 01:04:46,849
That's not it. His first name is Joe.

1918
01:04:46,849 --> 01:04:48,349
- Biden is his last name.
- Oh, it's the other way around.

1919
01:04:48,349 --> 01:04:49,818
- Okay, I got it.
- "The other way around"?

1920
01:04:49,918 --> 01:04:52,289
Oh, it's the other way
around. Okay, I got it.

1921
01:04:53,048 --> 01:04:54,958
Why would you pronounce it like that?

1922
01:04:54,958 --> 01:04:57,358
You should memorize the
name of the US president.

1923
01:04:57,358 --> 01:04:59,029
- President Joe.
- President Joe, got it.

1924
01:04:59,029 --> 01:05:00,059
"President Joe".

1925
01:05:00,099 --> 01:05:01,998
- Then how do we call him?
- It's not President Joe.

1926
01:05:01,998 --> 01:05:04,268
- It's President Biden.
- Biden? Okay.

1927
01:05:04,298 --> 01:05:05,628
Let's settle with that.

1928
01:05:05,768 --> 01:05:06,768
Here's the next question.

1929
01:05:06,768 --> 01:05:09,039
There are two ways of reading his name.

1930
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:10,068
We'll accept both.

1931
01:05:10,068 --> 01:05:11,268
Of course you should.

1932
01:05:11,268 --> 01:05:13,239
All right. 1, 2, 3.

1933
01:05:17,208 --> 01:05:18,248
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

1934
01:05:18,248 --> 01:05:19,409
- Kwang Soo, go ahead.
- A.

1935
01:05:19,409 --> 01:05:21,179
- "A".
- Let me answer!

1936
01:05:21,179 --> 01:05:22,179
- Let me answer!
- Go ahead.

1937
01:05:22,179 --> 01:05:23,389
- A.
- B.

1938
01:05:23,389 --> 01:05:24,849
- Let me answer!
- Why?

1939
01:05:24,849 --> 01:05:26,349
- A.
- B?

1940
01:05:26,349 --> 01:05:27,688
- Let me answer!
- Let me answer!

1941
01:05:27,719 --> 01:05:28,719
A.

1942
01:05:29,088 --> 01:05:30,559
- Bu.
- Let me answer!

1943
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:31,958
- I got it!
- What?

1944
01:05:32,259 --> 01:05:33,458
- A.
- Why is it wrong?

1945
01:05:33,458 --> 01:05:34,958
- "A".
- B.

1946
01:05:34,958 --> 01:05:36,529
- Ra.
- Ham.

1947
01:05:36,668 --> 01:05:37,668
- Lin.
- Coln.

1948
01:05:37,668 --> 01:05:39,029
- Correct.
- All right!

1949
01:05:39,029 --> 01:05:40,369
But I said the same thing!

1950
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:41,668
I said "A" also.

1951
01:05:41,668 --> 01:05:43,239
- He didn't say that!
- That wasn't correct.

1952
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:44,668
- He didn't say it.
- A, "A".

1953
01:05:44,668 --> 01:05:45,869
A, "A".

1954
01:05:45,869 --> 01:05:47,009
You can't pronounce it like that.

1955
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:48,409
You pronounce it that way!

1956
01:05:48,409 --> 01:05:49,779
It's just another way of saying it!

1957
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:52,179
- You have to say either...
- Abraham, Abraham.

1958
01:05:52,179 --> 01:05:53,449
"A"!

1959
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:55,079
Do you have a daughter in the US?

1960
01:05:55,079 --> 01:05:57,088
He probably said it with a Texan accent.

1961
01:05:57,088 --> 01:05:58,088
My accent is a little Texan.

1962
01:05:58,088 --> 01:06:01,259
According to the Korean dictionary,
there are two ways of saying it.

1963
01:06:01,259 --> 01:06:03,688
Why did you pronounce
it that way, you punk?

1964
01:06:03,688 --> 01:06:05,529
- Good job.
- Okay.

1965
01:06:05,659 --> 01:06:07,429
- You know,
- We did a good job.

1966
01:06:07,529 --> 01:06:09,699
Kwang Soo and I thought...

1967
01:06:09,699 --> 01:06:11,768
- Who did you think he was?
- We were like,

1968
01:06:11,768 --> 01:06:13,199
"Is he Einstein?"

1969
01:06:14,268 --> 01:06:16,298
- Einstein.
- I couldn't see the photo well.

1970
01:06:16,298 --> 01:06:17,809
- Me neither.
- I couldn't see the photo well.

1971
01:06:17,869 --> 01:06:19,639
It's confusing since it's
a black and white photo.

1972
01:06:19,838 --> 01:06:20,978
Empty Head.

1973
01:06:21,639 --> 01:06:23,139
The next person.

1974
01:06:23,608 --> 01:06:25,849
- There must be one Korean in there.
- 1, 2, 3.

1975
01:06:26,349 --> 01:06:27,378
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

1976
01:06:27,378 --> 01:06:28,418
Jong Kook.

1977
01:06:30,018 --> 01:06:31,489
- Three.
- Let me answer.

1978
01:06:31,489 --> 01:06:32,989
- Let me answer.
- Jong Kook.

1979
01:06:33,219 --> 01:06:34,719
- E.
- In.

1980
01:06:35,489 --> 01:06:37,128
- Let me answer.
- Se Chan.

1981
01:06:37,358 --> 01:06:38,558
- 3, 2.
- What?

1982
01:06:39,058 --> 01:06:40,928
- Let me answer.
- He wouldn't know the first name.

1983
01:06:41,598 --> 01:06:42,829
- E.
- In.

1984
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:43,968
- It's incorrect.
- Let me answer.

1985
01:06:44,029 --> 01:06:45,129
Al.

1986
01:06:45,999 --> 01:06:47,199
E.

1987
01:06:47,199 --> 01:06:48,669
- Let me answer.
- Ji Hyo.

1988
01:06:48,869 --> 01:06:49,968
Al.

1989
01:06:50,369 --> 01:06:51,369
F.

1990
01:06:51,369 --> 01:06:52,409
Me!

1991
01:06:52,568 --> 01:06:53,839
- Let me answer.
- Haha.

1992
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:55,039
- Al.
- Ber.

1993
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:56,508
- Ji.
- Let me answer.

1994
01:06:57,279 --> 01:06:58,279
Jae Seok.

1995
01:06:58,279 --> 01:06:59,508
- Al.
- Ber.

1996
01:06:59,579 --> 01:07:00,978
- T.
- Loan.

1997
01:07:00,978 --> 01:07:02,949
- My goodness.
- Let me answer.

1998
01:07:02,949 --> 01:07:04,388
- Al.
- Ber.

1999
01:07:04,419 --> 01:07:05,619
- T.
- Loan.

2000
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:07,218
- My goodness.
- Let me answer.

2001
01:07:07,218 --> 01:07:09,318
- Let me answer.
- Empty Head.

2002
01:07:09,318 --> 01:07:12,558
Let me answer. Let me answer.

2003
01:07:12,558 --> 01:07:14,058
- Jong Kook.
- Al.

2004
01:07:14,258 --> 01:07:15,829
- Ber.
- T.

2005
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:17,398
- E.
- In.

2006
01:07:17,398 --> 01:07:18,398
- S.
- Te.

2007
01:07:18,428 --> 01:07:19,428
- In.
- Okay.

2008
01:07:19,428 --> 01:07:20,468
For goodness' sake.

2009
01:07:21,699 --> 01:07:23,409
What in the world is Albert Loan?

2010
01:07:24,768 --> 01:07:25,909
Albert.

2011
01:07:25,909 --> 01:07:27,209
Do you think...

2012
01:07:27,879 --> 01:07:29,879
he is from the financial circle?

2013
01:07:31,709 --> 01:07:33,779
- Okay. Grab it.
- Here.

2014
01:07:33,779 --> 01:07:34,949
- We sat down.
- We sat down.

2015
01:07:34,949 --> 01:07:36,218
- We sat down.
- We get to go.

2016
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:37,848
- Here I go.
- Come on, Se Chan.

2017
01:07:37,848 --> 01:07:38,919
What is it?

2018
01:07:38,919 --> 01:07:40,089
The chance is high this time.

2019
01:07:40,619 --> 01:07:41,858
- It will come up.
- There are four slots left.

2020
01:07:41,858 --> 01:07:42,989
It didn't pop up.

2021
01:07:42,989 --> 01:07:44,129
It was shaken up earlier.

2022
01:07:44,129 --> 01:07:45,289
This is driving me crazy.

2023
01:07:45,329 --> 01:07:46,898
Push in another one. We
need to win 50 points.

2024
01:07:47,799 --> 01:07:49,659
- Please let them fail.
- The last one.

2025
01:07:49,659 --> 01:07:51,098
- Please let them fail.
- How many knives are left?

2026
01:07:51,098 --> 01:07:52,629
- None?
- Let's get over this.

2027
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:54,398
- There are 7 slots.
- 1 out of 7.

2028
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:56,669
Then the probability is only 15 percent.

2029
01:07:56,808 --> 01:07:57,968
1 out of 7.

2030
01:07:57,968 --> 01:07:59,739
Then the probability is only 15 percent.

2031
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:01,638
Then the probability is only 15 percent.

2032
01:08:01,909 --> 01:08:03,808
- Okay!
- That was insane.

2033
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:08,079
- Okay!
- That was insane.

2034
01:08:09,178 --> 01:08:10,388
That's so annoying.

2035
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:12,018
- I didn't want to see that.
- That's so annoying.

2036
01:08:12,018 --> 01:08:13,249
Nice!

2037
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:14,518
- Nice!
- That's so annoying.

2038
01:08:14,518 --> 01:08:15,959
We won with Albert Loan.

2039
01:08:16,388 --> 01:08:19,188
Albert Loan sounds like a stock item.

2040
01:08:19,228 --> 01:08:20,258
That's so annoying.

2041
01:08:20,258 --> 01:08:21,428
Is it a biotech stock?

2042
01:08:22,228 --> 01:08:23,499
Nice!

2043
01:08:23,529 --> 01:08:25,568
- You changed the seats, right?
- Yes.

2044
01:08:25,629 --> 01:08:26,869
Do you want to change the seats?

2045
01:08:26,869 --> 01:08:27,968
- Okay.
- Do you want to do it?

2046
01:08:27,968 --> 01:08:29,138
- Yes.
- All right.

2047
01:08:29,138 --> 01:08:30,669
Let's change the seats. Move.

2048
01:08:30,669 --> 01:08:31,739
Stay there.

2049
01:08:31,739 --> 01:08:33,608
- They changed the seats.
- Kim Grand Award,

2050
01:08:33,608 --> 01:08:35,339
- change seats with him.
- All right then.

2051
01:08:35,339 --> 01:08:37,209
Why did you listen to him
when you didn't listen to me?

2052
01:08:37,308 --> 01:08:39,409
- He is a senior.
- For goodness' sake.

2053
01:08:39,549 --> 01:08:40,749
- A junior who won the Grand Award.
- Come on.

2054
01:08:40,749 --> 01:08:42,619
Jong Kook didn't even
budge when he kicked him.

2055
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:43,789
You won't budge?

2056
01:08:43,789 --> 01:08:45,089
He is a junior who won the Grand Award.

2057
01:08:45,089 --> 01:08:46,619
So you won't budge.

2058
01:08:47,119 --> 01:08:48,718
It looks like you won, Seok Jin.

2059
01:08:49,388 --> 01:08:50,489
I am dusting the cushion.

2060
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:54,529
He is provoking Jong Kook.

2061
01:08:57,568 --> 01:08:58,768
Thank you for sitting still.

2062
01:09:03,669 --> 01:09:05,169
We are set.

2063
01:09:05,169 --> 01:09:06,409
It will be funny if we end it here.

2064
01:09:06,669 --> 01:09:08,739
Don't air my apology.

2065
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:10,779
I wondered what I should do...

2066
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:12,549
if you got up. Thank you.

2067
01:09:12,879 --> 01:09:14,848
Seok Jin hit him with
his hands trembling.

2068
01:09:18,119 --> 01:09:19,318
- All right.
- Let's go.

2069
01:09:19,318 --> 01:09:21,419
This time, you will have
a quiz on capital cities.

2070
01:09:21,489 --> 01:09:23,018
- Capital cities.
- Capital cities?

2071
01:09:23,018 --> 01:09:24,129
- Yes. Capital cities.
- Okay.

2072
01:09:24,228 --> 01:09:25,558
I am good with capitals.

2073
01:09:25,558 --> 01:09:27,329
- Let's go.
- When I give you the country name,

2074
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:29,258
- say a syllable...
- Let's go.

2075
01:09:29,258 --> 01:09:30,299
- each.
- Come on.

2076
01:09:30,299 --> 01:09:32,068
The first country is...

2077
01:09:33,068 --> 01:09:34,369
- Mongolia.
- Let me answer.

2078
01:09:34,739 --> 01:09:36,499
- U.
- Lan.

2079
01:09:36,499 --> 01:09:38,039
- Ba.
- To.

2080
01:09:39,768 --> 01:09:40,839
- To.
- R.

2081
01:09:40,839 --> 01:09:43,079
- Isn't it "Ulaanbaatar"?
- Is it correct?

2082
01:09:43,079 --> 01:09:44,279
- To.
- R.

2083
01:09:45,308 --> 01:09:46,648
- Isn't it "Ulaanbaatar"?
- Is it correct?

2084
01:09:46,648 --> 01:09:48,318
- Ulan Bator.
- It was too easy.

2085
01:09:48,318 --> 01:09:49,348
Is it "Ulan Bator"?

2086
01:09:49,419 --> 01:09:50,489
Is it?

2087
01:09:50,848 --> 01:09:52,449
- Ulan Bator.
- It was too easy.

2088
01:09:52,449 --> 01:09:53,589
Is it "Ulan Bator"?

2089
01:09:53,589 --> 01:09:54,688
"Ulan Bator" is a
correct way of saying it.

2090
01:09:54,718 --> 01:09:55,919
- Is it "Ulan Bator"?
- Yes.

2091
01:09:55,919 --> 01:09:56,989
Jae Seok, we got it right!

2092
01:09:57,428 --> 01:09:59,129
Is it "Ulan Bator"?

2093
01:09:59,428 --> 01:10:01,129
I have good pronunciation.

2094
01:10:01,129 --> 01:10:02,199
Ulan Bator.

2095
01:10:02,299 --> 01:10:04,468
- That was great.
- It was a clean answer.

2096
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:08,839
How could he be so annoying?

2097
01:10:08,839 --> 01:10:10,869
- That was so much fun.
- The next capital.

2098
01:10:13,339 --> 01:10:14,608
- Iraq.
- Let me answer.

2099
01:10:15,409 --> 01:10:16,508
Haha.

2100
01:10:17,648 --> 01:10:19,108
- Let me answer.
- Kwang Soo.

2101
01:10:20,178 --> 01:10:21,678
- What?
- For goodness' sake.

2102
01:10:22,478 --> 01:10:24,018
"What?"

2103
01:10:24,949 --> 01:10:26,089
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

2104
01:10:26,089 --> 01:10:27,289
- Se Chan.
- Ja.

2105
01:10:27,358 --> 01:10:28,718
No, no.

2106
01:10:28,718 --> 01:10:30,829
- Let me answer.
- Iraq.

2107
01:10:30,928 --> 01:10:31,989
B.

2108
01:10:34,499 --> 01:10:35,529
B.

2109
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:37,299
- Io.
- Let me answer.

2110
01:10:37,369 --> 01:10:38,428
Bio.

2111
01:10:38,428 --> 01:10:39,468
- Ba.
- Gh.

2112
01:10:39,468 --> 01:10:40,468
- Da.
- D.

2113
01:10:40,568 --> 01:10:41,638
Nice!

2114
01:10:44,768 --> 01:10:45,869
Nice!

2115
01:10:45,938 --> 01:10:47,438
- We are on a roll today, Jae Seok.
- Bio!

2116
01:10:47,678 --> 01:10:50,709
Here come the protruding mouth brothers!

2117
01:10:50,709 --> 01:10:53,409
- Let's go! Nice!
- Nice!

2118
01:10:53,409 --> 01:10:55,049
- It was amazing.
- We are getting everything right.

2119
01:10:55,119 --> 01:10:56,348
I was the master of the quiz.

2120
01:10:57,148 --> 01:10:58,818
Jae Seok,

2121
01:10:58,888 --> 01:11:01,358
I am no longer Empty
Head when I am with you.

2122
01:11:01,358 --> 01:11:02,858
Kwang Soo's answer was so funny.

2123
01:11:03,289 --> 01:11:04,789
He said "Bio".

2124
01:11:04,858 --> 01:11:06,228
- Seriously.
- My goodness.

2125
01:11:06,329 --> 01:11:07,358
Baghdad.

2126
01:11:07,358 --> 01:11:08,529
The Iraq War.

2127
01:11:09,029 --> 01:11:10,369
I remembered the Iraq War.

2128
01:11:10,428 --> 01:11:11,869
You are doing great today.

2129
01:11:11,898 --> 01:11:13,129
I wasn't Empty Head.

2130
01:11:13,428 --> 01:11:14,799
Bio.

2131
01:11:14,898 --> 01:11:16,239
Here comes the next question.

2132
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:18,768
Don't you know "Baghdad
and the 50 Thieves"?

2133
01:11:19,369 --> 01:11:20,638
That's Ali Baba.

2134
01:11:21,308 --> 01:11:23,108
It isn't "Baghdad and the 50 Thieves".

2135
01:11:23,209 --> 01:11:24,779
It's "Ali Baba and the 50 Thieves".

2136
01:11:25,608 --> 01:11:26,749
Empty Head.

2137
01:11:26,749 --> 01:11:27,848
The next capital.

2138
01:11:29,379 --> 01:11:30,388
The next capital.

2139
01:11:30,388 --> 01:11:31,489
Se Chan is really good at this.

2140
01:11:31,489 --> 01:11:32,789
- Norway.
- Let me answer.

2141
01:11:33,089 --> 01:11:34,258
- Haha.
- Van.

2142
01:11:34,619 --> 01:11:35,659
Das.

2143
01:11:37,029 --> 01:11:38,558
- Let me answer.
- Se Chan.

2144
01:11:38,858 --> 01:11:39,928
I don't know.

2145
01:11:40,598 --> 01:11:41,659
Let me answer.

2146
01:11:41,659 --> 01:11:42,699
- Seok Jin.
- My goodness.

2147
01:11:42,699 --> 01:11:43,768
Let me answer.

2148
01:11:43,768 --> 01:11:44,898
Seok Jin.

2149
01:11:44,968 --> 01:11:46,369
- Van.
- Hel.

2150
01:11:46,898 --> 01:11:47,898
Sing.

2151
01:11:48,339 --> 01:11:50,308
- That's a movie.
- Isn't "Van Helsing" a movie?

2152
01:11:50,308 --> 01:11:52,268
- Is it a movie?
- Isn't it a movie? Let me answer.

2153
01:11:52,268 --> 01:11:53,468
- Se Chan.
- Wasn't it something like that?

2154
01:11:53,468 --> 01:11:54,539
Van.

2155
01:11:56,039 --> 01:11:57,449
- Is it incorrect?
- Are you going to be like that?

2156
01:11:58,678 --> 01:11:59,709
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

2157
01:11:59,709 --> 01:12:00,718
Jong Kook, go ahead.

2158
01:12:00,718 --> 01:12:01,818
- O.
- Sl.

2159
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:02,978
Ram.

2160
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:04,318
- What?
- Let me answer.

2161
01:12:04,848 --> 01:12:06,289
You said it's Oslram.

2162
01:12:06,348 --> 01:12:07,758
- Se Chan.
- What?

2163
01:12:07,758 --> 01:12:09,089
- O.
- Sl.

2164
01:12:09,089 --> 01:12:10,928
- Bi.
- For goodness' sake.

2165
01:12:11,228 --> 01:12:12,228
- O.
- Sl.

2166
01:12:12,228 --> 01:12:14,098
- Bi.
- For goodness' sake.

2167
01:12:16,959 --> 01:12:19,068
Oslbi.

2168
01:12:20,228 --> 01:12:21,398
Oslbi.

2169
01:12:21,799 --> 01:12:22,938
Oslbi.

2170
01:12:22,938 --> 01:12:25,039
- Hey. Hey.
- Oslbi.

2171
01:12:25,339 --> 01:12:26,508
What kind of an answer is "Oslbi"?

2172
01:12:26,568 --> 01:12:27,579
Let me answer.

2173
01:12:27,579 --> 01:12:28,909
- Oslbi.
- Give me a chance. Let me answer.

2174
01:12:28,909 --> 01:12:30,108
- Let me answer.
- Haha, go ahead.

2175
01:12:30,108 --> 01:12:31,108
- O.
- Sl.

2176
01:12:31,148 --> 01:12:32,148
- O.
- Yes.

2177
01:12:32,808 --> 01:12:35,018
- Okay.
- It was Oslo.

2178
01:12:35,249 --> 01:12:37,049
- It's okay.
- It's okay to make a mistake.

2179
01:12:37,049 --> 01:12:38,888
- "Oslbi" was a funny answer.
- Oslo.

2180
01:12:39,619 --> 01:12:43,188
When Oslbi falls early in the morning

2181
01:12:43,188 --> 01:12:45,558
- Three umbrellas walk
- Side by side.

2182
01:12:45,558 --> 01:12:47,228
I knew it was Oslo.

2183
01:12:47,728 --> 01:12:48,728
Here they come.

2184
01:12:50,768 --> 01:12:52,299
- All of them popped.
- For goodness' sake.

2185
01:12:52,299 --> 01:12:53,699
All of them are fake!

2186
01:12:53,699 --> 01:12:55,098
Okay, okay. I sat down!

2187
01:12:56,598 --> 01:12:57,638
All right.

2188
01:12:58,169 --> 01:12:59,209
- You can't do that.
- You can't do that.

2189
01:12:59,209 --> 01:13:00,909
- We sat down.
- We sat down.

2190
01:13:01,178 --> 01:13:02,709
- Hold on.
- So Min.

2191
01:13:02,709 --> 01:13:04,579
- So Min.
- So Min.

2192
01:13:04,579 --> 01:13:05,909
- We sat down.
- I received a tip-off...

2193
01:13:05,909 --> 01:13:07,678
about the bad odor that came...

2194
01:13:07,678 --> 01:13:08,779
- when the balloons popped.
- No, no.

2195
01:13:08,779 --> 01:13:10,449
No, seriously. When
the balloons popped...

2196
01:13:10,449 --> 01:13:11,489
No!

2197
01:13:12,218 --> 01:13:14,688
Okay, okay. I sat down.

2198
01:13:14,818 --> 01:13:16,688
Jae Seok, why do I
smell something sour...

2199
01:13:16,688 --> 01:13:18,728
after the balloons popped?

2200
01:13:19,159 --> 01:13:20,188
No, seriously.

2201
01:13:20,188 --> 01:13:21,829
- When the balloons popped,
- No!

2202
01:13:21,829 --> 01:13:23,299
- I smelled something sour.
- No.

2203
01:13:23,358 --> 01:13:24,428
- So Min.
- It really wasn't me.

2204
01:13:24,428 --> 01:13:25,629
- So Min.
- It wasn't me.

2205
01:13:25,728 --> 01:13:27,499
- So Min.
- It wasn't me.

2206
01:13:27,999 --> 01:13:29,869
- My goodness.
- I smelled something sour.

2207
01:13:29,968 --> 01:13:31,108
We sat down.

2208
01:13:31,108 --> 01:13:32,568
- Hurry up.
- We need to catch the culprit.

2209
01:13:32,709 --> 01:13:34,409
There's someone who
smells sour among us.

2210
01:13:34,508 --> 01:13:35,709
Okay. Let's try this slot.

2211
01:13:36,579 --> 01:13:37,879
Yes!

2212
01:13:39,209 --> 01:13:40,518
This is the last question on capitals.

2213
01:13:40,678 --> 01:13:42,119
- Hungary.
- Let me answer.

2214
01:13:46,419 --> 01:13:47,888
- Haha.
- Bu.

2215
01:13:47,888 --> 01:13:49,058
- Da.
- Pe.

2216
01:13:49,058 --> 01:13:50,089
- S.
- T.

2217
01:13:50,089 --> 01:13:51,989
They got it right. Budapest, Hungary.

2218
01:13:53,428 --> 01:13:54,459
My goodness.

2219
01:13:54,459 --> 01:13:55,629
- The balloons...
- What?

2220
01:13:55,629 --> 01:13:56,758
Where are the balloons?

2221
01:14:00,228 --> 01:14:01,869
Hey, these are fake.

2222
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:03,239
No.

2223
01:14:03,239 --> 01:14:05,138
Jae Seok!

2224
01:14:05,669 --> 01:14:06,869
I figured it out.

2225
01:14:06,869 --> 01:14:08,508
It's the smell of someone's
feet. I figured it out.

2226
01:14:08,539 --> 01:14:09,709
I figured it out.

2227
01:14:09,709 --> 01:14:11,579
I figured it out. It's the
smell of someone's feet.

2228
01:14:11,579 --> 01:14:13,779
- Someone has stinky feet.
- It's the smell of someone's feet.

2229
01:14:13,779 --> 01:14:14,848
- Someone has stinky feet.
- Throw it.

2230
01:14:14,848 --> 01:14:16,018
Haha!

2231
01:14:16,079 --> 01:14:17,119
It popped out!

2232
01:14:19,648 --> 01:14:21,058
It popped out!

2233
01:14:22,589 --> 01:14:23,659
Did it pop out?

2234
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:28,459
We were fighting.

2235
01:14:28,659 --> 01:14:30,398
Seriously.

2236
01:14:31,228 --> 01:14:32,369
Okay, okay.

2237
01:14:32,369 --> 01:14:33,669
Find the person who has stinky feet.

2238
01:14:33,669 --> 01:14:34,869
- Who is it?
- It isn't me.

2239
01:14:34,869 --> 01:14:36,098
- Find the person.
- Who is it?

2240
01:14:36,098 --> 01:14:37,098
- It isn't me.
- It isn't me.

2241
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:39,169
- Ji Hyo.
- It isn't me.

2242
01:14:39,169 --> 01:14:40,268
Ji Hyo's feet were stinky last week.

2243
01:14:40,268 --> 01:14:42,209
It isn't me. It wasn't
me last week either.

2244
01:14:42,209 --> 01:14:44,049
Let's have Bo Pil smell
our feet for fairness.

2245
01:14:44,049 --> 01:14:45,848
Let's have Bo Pil smell
our feet for fairness.

2246
01:14:48,348 --> 01:14:49,579
That's right.

2247
01:14:50,549 --> 01:14:52,589
- That's right.
- That's right.

2248
01:14:52,589 --> 01:14:54,089
That's right. Bo Pil.

2249
01:14:54,989 --> 01:14:56,558
- Gosh.
- No!

2250
01:14:56,919 --> 01:14:58,129
- Stinky feet.
- Really?

2251
01:14:59,329 --> 01:15:02,029
- No!
- Stinky feet.

2252
01:15:03,428 --> 01:15:05,299
- Good job.
- Come here.

2253
01:15:05,629 --> 01:15:06,669
Come here.

2254
01:15:06,829 --> 01:15:08,039
- For goodness' sake.
- Gosh.

2255
01:15:11,409 --> 01:15:12,638
- For goodness' sake.
- Gosh.

2256
01:15:13,879 --> 01:15:17,108
Hey, it smells like fart.

2257
01:15:19,579 --> 01:15:20,619
- Take them off.
- Hey.

2258
01:15:21,379 --> 01:15:22,648
Throw them outside.

2259
01:15:24,318 --> 01:15:25,449
Hey.

2260
01:15:25,449 --> 01:15:27,388
- It was Se Chan.
- It was you.

2261
01:15:27,388 --> 01:15:28,858
No wonder the sour smell...

2262
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:30,388
kept circling me.

2263
01:15:33,358 --> 01:15:35,199
I wondered where it was coming from.

2264
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:36,428
It was coming from my feet.

2265
01:15:36,428 --> 01:15:38,029
- I am sorry.
- Hey.

2266
01:15:38,029 --> 01:15:39,629
Don't you wash your feet?

2267
01:15:39,629 --> 01:15:40,739
Wash your feet!

2268
01:15:40,739 --> 01:15:41,999
- Gosh.
- It wasn't me.

2269
01:15:41,999 --> 01:15:43,098
So Min and Ji Hyo, I am sorry.

2270
01:15:43,098 --> 01:15:45,339
- It was the smell of his feet.
- That was funny.

2271
01:15:45,339 --> 01:15:46,869
I suspected you guys for a short while.

2272
01:15:46,869 --> 01:15:48,008
It wasn't us.

2273
01:15:48,508 --> 01:15:49,709
I came to my senses.

2274
01:15:50,339 --> 01:15:51,978
- His feet don't stink now.
- Hey.

2275
01:15:51,978 --> 01:15:53,049
My goodness.

2276
01:15:53,848 --> 01:15:54,949
There we go.

2277
01:15:54,949 --> 01:15:56,379
Please sit down.

2278
01:15:56,379 --> 01:15:58,419
The result is out.

2279
01:15:59,089 --> 01:16:01,688
Haha and Seok Jin placed
last with 30 points.

2280
01:16:01,688 --> 01:16:04,058
So Min and Ji Hyo placed
3rd with 90 points.

2281
01:16:04,388 --> 01:16:06,659
The other 2 teams are
co-winners with 130 points.

2282
01:16:06,659 --> 01:16:08,829
The two teams will have a
question of the Guess Who Quiz.

2283
01:16:08,829 --> 01:16:12,369
We got a lot of questions right.

2284
01:16:12,369 --> 01:16:14,098
We got a lot of questions right too.

2285
01:16:14,098 --> 01:16:16,568
For goodness' sake. Don't
be like that, Jae Seok.

2286
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:18,608
You should know better.

2287
01:16:18,608 --> 01:16:20,369
You have won a good award.

2288
01:16:20,369 --> 01:16:23,178
- You will lose, so sit down.
- Sit down.

2289
01:16:23,178 --> 01:16:26,178
All right. I will be
objective with this question.

2290
01:16:26,178 --> 01:16:27,449
- Okay.
- Okay.

2291
01:16:27,449 --> 01:16:28,518
Guess Who Quiz.

2292
01:16:32,449 --> 01:16:33,449
Let's go.

2293
01:16:33,449 --> 01:16:34,459
Let me answer.

2294
01:16:34,459 --> 01:16:35,518

Hul.

2297
01:16:45,428 --> 01:16:46,568
Does that work?

2298
01:16:46,728 --> 01:16:48,169
No, he has a name.

2299
01:16:48,169 --> 01:16:49,768
His name is... Hold on.

2300
01:16:51,209 --> 01:16:52,638
- I don't remember.
- Let me answer.

2301
01:16:52,739 --> 01:16:53,938

2302

2309
01:17:04,749 --> 01:17:06,449
- I don't know.
- I will answer. Let me answer.

2310
01:17:06,449 --> 01:17:07,789
- Do I go 1st?
- Kwang Soo should go 1st.

2311
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:09,619
- Mar.
- You should have let me go first.

2312
01:17:10,089 --> 01:17:11,258
K.

2313
01:17:11,629 --> 01:17:12,659
Long.

2314
01:17:13,428 --> 01:17:14,428
Let me answer.

2315
01:17:14,428 --> 01:17:15,598
Kwang Soo, go first.

2316
01:17:15,598 --> 01:17:16,598
Mar.

2317
01:17:16,598 --> 01:17:17,799
Is he going first again?

2318
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:21,199
- You should give us a chance!
- Hey!

2319
01:17:21,499 --> 01:17:22,999
- Mar.
- Mark.

2320
01:17:23,799 --> 01:17:25,209

2321
01:17:25,409 --> 01:17:27,108
- Let me answer. Mar.

2324
01:17:31,808 --> 01:17:33,308

2325
01:17:33,308 --> 01:17:34,749
- Mar.
- K.

2326
01:17:35,218 --> 01:17:36,879
- Ru.
- Hey.

2327
01:17:38,549 --> 01:17:40,218
- What are you doing?
- Hey.

2328
01:17:40,348 --> 01:17:41,818
- He doesn't know the answer.
- Kwang Soo should have gone first.

2329
01:17:41,818 --> 01:17:43,089
- Seriously.
- Phi.

2330
01:17:43,218 --> 01:17:44,388
Phi.

2331
01:17:44,388 --> 01:17:45,959
- Is it Mark Loan? No, no.
- Mark Loan?

2332
01:17:45,959 --> 01:17:48,529
Why do you like loans so much?

2333
01:17:48,529 --> 01:17:49,659
- Mark Loan?
- Mark.

2334
01:17:49,659 --> 01:17:50,898
It sounds like macaron.

2335
01:17:50,898 --> 01:17:51,968
Let me answer.

2336
01:17:51,968 --> 01:17:53,398
- Mar.
- K.

2337
01:17:53,398 --> 01:17:55,169
- Ru.
- E.

2338
01:17:55,169 --> 01:17:56,369
Let me answer.

2339
01:17:56,398 --> 01:17:57,869
- We are set.
- What's the answer?

2340
01:17:57,869 --> 01:17:59,308
- Mar.
- K.

2341
01:17:59,308 --> 01:18:00,568
- Ru.
- Ffa.

2342
01:18:00,568 --> 01:18:01,938
- Lo.
- Okay.

2343
01:18:01,938 --> 01:18:03,279
Okay!

2344
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:04,579
I knew the name.

2345
01:18:04,779 --> 01:18:06,508
- Ruffalo.
- Ruffalo.

2346
01:18:06,508 --> 01:18:07,549
Mark Ruffalo.

2347
01:18:07,549 --> 01:18:10,218
- We did it. Okay.
- Mark Ruffalo.

2348
01:18:10,218 --> 01:18:12,549
- Jong Kook and Kwang Soo won.
- Okay!

2349
01:18:13,419 --> 01:18:16,619
- Mark Ruffalo.
- Decide who will spin first.

2350
01:18:16,619 --> 01:18:17,758
Okay.

2351
01:18:17,758 --> 01:18:18,989
- Mark Ruffalo.
- We fought well.

2352
01:18:18,989 --> 01:18:20,758
Ruffalo.

2353
01:18:23,299 --> 01:18:25,068
Who will spin the roulette first?

2354
01:18:28,068 --> 01:18:29,568
If you add it...

2355
01:18:34,178 --> 01:18:36,308
It's time to spin the
roulette one last time.

2356
01:18:36,308 --> 01:18:38,808
The chosen one will have his or
her comment on each member...

2357
01:18:38,808 --> 01:18:40,478
and project objective on the website.

2358
01:18:40,478 --> 01:18:41,779
- So this is the final decision.
- Yes.

2359
01:18:41,779 --> 01:18:44,749
The chosen one will also
receive the prize money...

2360
01:18:44,749 --> 01:18:47,758
of 100 dollars per name
tag on the roulette.

2361
01:18:47,758 --> 01:18:48,989
It will be like a writer's pay.

2362
01:18:52,058 --> 01:18:53,558
I have a chance.

2363
01:18:53,688 --> 01:18:54,928
I have a few name tags on there.

2364
01:18:58,468 --> 01:19:00,098
Why don't we have a staff
member spin the roulette?

2365
01:19:00,629 --> 01:19:04,068
Then Sun Myung should spin it.

2366
01:19:04,068 --> 01:19:05,108
- Sun Myung.
- Yes.

2367
01:19:05,108 --> 01:19:07,478
- This is the last roulette.
- Spin it hard.

2368
01:19:07,539 --> 01:19:09,239
Sun Myung, let's see it.

2369
01:19:09,239 --> 01:19:10,308
Here it goes.

2370
01:19:10,308 --> 01:19:11,808
- Sun Myung!
- Sun Myung!

2371
01:19:12,279 --> 01:19:14,449
- Let's go.
- You followed me a lot.

2372
01:19:14,449 --> 01:19:15,779
Get mine.

2373
01:19:16,379 --> 01:19:18,549
It all depends on luck.

2374
01:19:18,749 --> 01:19:20,188
That's right.

2375
01:19:20,318 --> 01:19:22,258
All right! It's me!

2376
01:19:22,558 --> 01:19:24,989
It's me!

2377
01:19:25,188 --> 01:19:26,659
It's me!

2378
01:19:26,659 --> 01:19:27,799
It's me!

2379
01:19:29,699 --> 01:19:32,268
- It's me!
- Is it Jae Seok?

2380
01:19:32,568 --> 01:19:33,768
Jae Seok.

2381
01:19:34,999 --> 01:19:36,369
- What is this?
- Hey!

2382
01:19:37,239 --> 01:19:38,568
- What is this?
- Hey!

2383
01:19:39,108 --> 01:19:40,438
He didn't put his name tag once.

2384
01:19:41,478 --> 01:19:42,779
He didn't put his name tag once.

2385
01:19:45,579 --> 01:19:48,049
- This is absurd. I feel cheated!
- How did this happen?

2386
01:19:48,218 --> 01:19:51,218
- This is absurd. I feel cheated!
- How did this happen?

2387
01:19:51,218 --> 01:19:52,388
This is ridiculous.

2388
01:19:52,388 --> 01:19:53,449
I feel so dejected.

2389
01:19:53,449 --> 01:19:54,459
Sun Myung, thank you.

2390
01:19:54,459 --> 01:19:55,659
I feel so dejected.

2391
01:19:55,659 --> 01:19:57,289
How did this happen?

2392
01:19:57,289 --> 01:19:59,688
This show must be Yu
Jae Seok's Running Man.

2393
01:19:59,688 --> 01:20:00,799
It suits the production objective.

2394
01:20:00,799 --> 01:20:02,398
It's 100 dollars per name tag,

2395
01:20:02,398 --> 01:20:05,228
so he will receive 400
dollars in gift cards.

2396
01:20:05,369 --> 01:20:08,638
Jae Seok's production
objective and comments...

2397
01:20:08,799 --> 01:20:11,709
will go up on the website. If
you want to add something...

2398
01:20:11,709 --> 01:20:13,808
I will combine what everyone wrote...

2399
01:20:13,808 --> 01:20:15,779
- and use the comments I like.
- Okay.

2400
01:20:15,779 --> 01:20:17,178
- My production objective was nice.
- What?

2401
01:20:17,178 --> 01:20:18,709
- My production objective.
- All right.

2402
01:20:18,709 --> 01:20:20,008
Please use "Mr. Dirty Mustache".

2403
01:20:20,008 --> 01:20:21,718
I will add it. Don't worry.

2404
01:20:21,718 --> 01:20:23,818
Se Chan's feet continue to
stink even without the socks.

2405
01:20:23,978 --> 01:20:25,449
He needs to wash them.

2406
01:20:25,449 --> 01:20:28,218
Come here for a second.
I will wash your feet.

2407
01:20:28,218 --> 01:20:29,258
No.

2408
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:33,129
- You are a celebrity.
- My shoes...

2409
01:20:36,758 --> 01:20:39,169
Variety shows are
disappearing these days.

2410
01:20:39,169 --> 01:20:41,398
Running Man is Korea's favorite
variety show that's been...

2411
01:20:41,598 --> 01:20:44,308
on Sunday nights for over 10 years.

2412
01:20:44,438 --> 01:20:48,539
The members play games and clear
missions with various guest stars,

2413
01:20:48,539 --> 01:20:50,638
as they go around to different places.

2414
01:20:50,638 --> 01:20:53,449
Among various fun factors,

2415
01:20:53,449 --> 01:20:55,318
this show only focuses on laughter.

2416
01:20:55,348 --> 01:20:57,379
Open your eyes. Fun on
a big scale will come.

2417
01:20:57,379 --> 01:20:59,549
Open your mouth. Laughter
on a big scale will come.

2418
01:20:59,619 --> 01:21:02,619
Open your heart. A
great lesson will come.

2419
01:21:06,529 --> 01:21:08,629
Yu Jae Seok. The Unchanging
Goofball of variety shows.

2420
01:21:08,629 --> 01:21:09,999
He is the pride of Running Man.

2421
01:21:09,999 --> 01:21:12,268
Jee Seok Jin. The Hugh
Grant of Jamwon-dong...

2422
01:21:12,268 --> 01:21:13,598
who pretends to love his family.

2423
01:21:13,629 --> 01:21:15,739
Kim Jong Kook. In
summer, he is Kim Nipple.

2424
01:21:15,799 --> 01:21:17,268
In other seasons, he is Enema Kim.

2425
01:21:17,299 --> 01:21:19,568
Haha. Mr. Dirty Mustache who
is the worst at acting young...

2426
01:21:19,568 --> 01:21:21,978
among celebrities who were born in 1979.

2427
01:21:22,039 --> 01:21:24,978
Song Ji Hyo. Her real name is
Cheon Seong Im, Cheon Su Yeon.

2428
01:21:25,008 --> 01:21:26,148
Her nickname is Jeoktoma.

2429
01:21:26,209 --> 01:21:28,949
Lee Kwang Soo. The
butler of A-list actors.

2430
01:21:29,079 --> 01:21:31,419
Jeon So Min. The Crazy Poet.

2431
01:21:31,419 --> 01:21:33,089
Yang Se Chan. Yang Se
Hyeong's younger brother.

2432
01:21:33,119 --> 01:21:34,119
Has handsome gums.

2433
01:21:34,119 --> 01:21:37,318
Yu Jae Seok's production objective
and the comments on the members...

2434
01:21:37,318 --> 01:21:39,489
can be seen on Running Man's website.

2435
01:21:39,489 --> 01:21:41,199
Isn't this a delinquents' school?

2436
01:21:41,459 --> 01:21:43,029
The guitarist.

2437
01:21:43,029 --> 01:21:44,228
We are in the dance club.

2438
01:21:44,228 --> 01:21:45,568
- Turn off the music.
- Be quiet!

2439
01:21:45,568 --> 01:21:47,938
What does your father do?
Look at these students!

2440
01:21:47,938 --> 01:21:49,669
Why would you swing that in school?

2441
01:21:49,968 --> 01:21:51,308
Loyalty.

2442
01:21:52,239 --> 01:21:53,968
- Loyalty.
- Loyalty.

2443
01:21:54,539 --> 01:21:55,709
Let's go.

2444
01:21:57,608 --> 01:21:59,279
- There we go!
- Did he take a bribe?

2445
01:21:59,379 --> 01:22:00,608
For goodness' sake!

2446
01:22:00,608 --> 01:22:01,949
Get your acts together, okay?

2447
01:22:01,949 --> 01:22:03,379
I can't do this.

2448
01:22:03,379 --> 01:22:06,518
Friends should help each other!
Student guidance club is the worst.

2449
01:22:06,619 --> 01:22:08,589
- Why did you come here?
- I came...

2450
01:22:08,589 --> 01:22:10,258

2451
01:22:10,619 --> 01:22:12,358
- Kwang Soo.
- What are you doing?

2452
01:22:12,358 --> 01:22:14,398
I will never visit this show again!

2453
01:22:14,459 --> 01:22:17,558
Let's go!
