200
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:28,250
你可是个超级歌星啊
I mean, you are a huge singing star,

201
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,818
我却要用声音震撼你
And here I am trying to impress you with my voice.

202
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:32,988
卡尔 我就是个平凡的老家伙 行吗?
Kyle, now, I'm just a regular old guy, all right?

203
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:35,257
我没什么特别的
Nothing special about me, okay?

204
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:37,092
好吧 好吧 我将要唱的是...
Okay, okay, well, what I was gonna sing is...

205
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:38,527
我是说 我是独特
I mean, I was special.

206
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:40,395
当我在演唱时候 你可以想象下
I mean, when you think about it, when I was singing, you know?

207
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,199
爷可是和迈克.麦当劳合唱过的 懂吗?
When I did that duet with michael McDonald, you know?

208
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:45,391
你懂的
you know?

209
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,337
是的 - 但是
Yeah. - But, yeah.

210
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:50,439
那个的确特别 不过这跟我没关系
That was special, you know? But it's not about me.

211
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:52,908
这是你的时刻 你要为我们演唱什么?
This is about you. So what you got for us?

212
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,811
好的 我带来
Okay, so here goes:

213
00:08:55,936 --> 00:09:00,382
奇异盛典

214
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:04,353
谢谢 - 怎么了?
Thank you. - What?

215
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:07,890
卡尔 跑调太明显了 太跑了
Kyle, that was real pitchy, dog, real pitchy.

216
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:10,158
你懂的 - 你走把
You know... - Off you go.

217
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,693
那我唱另外首 - 可以了
Well, I got another song... - You're done.

218
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:13,486
我们会联系你的 - 才怪
We'll call you. - We won't.

219
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,469
老兄 这就是我们的好苗子?
Man, is that the best we got?

220
00:09:19,594 --> 00:09:21,438
是的 我们得坚信
Yes, and we have to let the judges know.

221
00:09:21,563 --> 00:09:23,039
潜力股正在出现
Our lead singer right away.

222
00:09:23,164 --> 00:09:25,611
时间所剩无几了 -闹心
The clock is ticking, reverend. Dang it.

223
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:28,013
我都在集会上宣布
I mean, I told the whole congregation.

224
00:09:28,138 --> 00:09:29,514
我们会赢了
We were gonna win this thing,

225
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,583
但现在我还没看见一个有才的
And I don't think we got anybody good enough.

226
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,752
你可别忘了你是目视着众人的眼睛
And don't forget you looked them in the eye.

227
00:09:33,877 --> 00:09:35,721
对他们保证过的
And gave them the boyce ballentine guarantee.

228
00:09:35,846 --> 00:09:38,857
我知道我有
I know what I did.

229
00:09:38,982 --> 00:09:41,494
还有最后两个了
Well, there are two more auditions,

230
00:09:41,619 --> 00:09:44,030
看来也是没戏了 算了吧 -别这样
But it's probably not worth it. Oh, don't do that.

231
00:09:44,155 --> 00:09:47,033
还是看看 说不定有奇迹呢
Let's see them, all right? They... they could be great.

232
00:09:47,158 --> 00:09:49,669
你硬要的话
If you insist.

233
00:09:49,794 --> 00:09:50,870
下一个
Next!

234
00:09:50,995 --> 00:09:53,307
哦
Oh

235
00:09:53,432 --> 00:09:57,745 
我爱耶稣
How I love jesus

236
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,281
哦
Oh

237
00:10:00,406 --> 00:10:05,253
我爱耶稣
How I love jesus 

238
00:10:05,378 --> 00:10:06,487 
哦
Oh 

239
00:10:06,612 --> 00:10:11,393 
为什么我爱耶稣
How I love jesus 

240
00:10:11,518 --> 00:10:16,131 
因为他先无私的爱着我
Because he first loved me

241
00:10:20,594 --> 00:10:22,871
耶! 这样才像话嘛!
Yeah! Now that's what I'm talking about!

235
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:23,905
你还说不见他们呢
And you didn't even want to see them.

236
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,840
我兄啊
My bad.

237
00:10:25,965 --> 00:10:28,676
女士们 你叫什么
Ladies, what's your names?

238
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:30,678
- 我叫露丝 - 我交凯瑟琳
- I'm rose. - And I'm catherine.

239
00:10:30,803 --> 00:10:31,946
我们是粉红姐妹
And we're the pinkney sisters.

240
00:10:32,071 --> 00:10:34,315
你会招她们的 是吗
You just had to bring them, didn't you?

241
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,552
你还想不想要赢啊
Do you want to win, or not?

242
00:10:37,677 --> 00:10:39,454
你知道这对我们教堂意味着什么吗
Do you know what this would mean to our church?

243
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:40,688
我当然知道
Of course I do.

244
00:10:40,813 --> 00:10:43,158
但 不 不
But... No, no, no.

245
00:10:43,283 --> 00:10:45,294
不 这不行 我不能这么做
No, this is wrong. I can't do it.

246
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:47,529
因为开销问题
We could pay them out of petty cash.

247
00:10:47,654 --> 00:10:49,088
她们可是摇钱树啊
That way, we won't leave a paper trail.

248
00:10:53,428 --> 00:10:54,537
哦
Oh  
 
256 
00:10:54,662 --> 00:10:59,175 
我爱耶稣
how I love jesus 

257 
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,145
因为耶稣
Because he first

258 
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:06,839 
博爱人间
Loved me

259 00:11:10,444 --> 00:11:11,444 
招吧
Do it.

249
00:11:14,543 --> 00:11:18,179
亲爱的 今天可是我在沙龙过的最好的一天
Baby, today was the best day ever at the salon.

250
00:11:19,023 --> 00:11:22,469
起来 我要让你爽死
Stand up so I can make it rain on you.

251
00:11:22,594 --> 00:11:24,737
现在没心情 宝贝
I'm not in the mood, babe.

252
00:11:24,862 --> 00:11:26,105
怎么了
What's wrong?

253
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,975
我感觉不太好
You know, I just don't feel good.

254
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,610
雇佣了那两个女孩
About hiring those ringers.

255
00:11:29,735 --> 00:11:31,745
我想你是太过于担心了
I think you're being too hard on yourself.

256
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:35,216
就把它当成是比投资啊
You know, just think of it as making an investment.

257
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:36,785
为教堂的未来着想啊
In the future of your church.

258
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,820
我要是你 我就这么想
I mean, that's what I thought, you know?

259
00:11:38,945 --> 00:11:40,355
我真的很想赢
And I do want to win this thing.

260
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,827
好吧 有时我们要学会知足
Well, sometimes we got to do what we got to do.

261
00:11:44,952 --> 00:11:46,229
你说的没错
I guess you're right.

262
00:11:46,354 --> 00:11:47,430
好把 谢谢宝贝
All right, thank you, baby.

263
00:11:47,555 --> 00:11:50,367
你没有留下活动记录吧
You didn't leave a paper trail, did you?

264
00:11:50,492 --> 00:11:51,701
你好 老妈
Hey, mom.

265
00:11:51,826 --> 00:11:53,270
我朋友的妈妈说
So my friend's mother said.

266
00:11:53,395 --> 00:11:55,105
 Stamps已经做了两星期了
That stamps is booked up for two whole weeks.

267
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,907
她出五十刀叫我给她
She offered to give me 50 bucks if I can get them in.

268
00:11:58,032 --> 00:11:59,476
Lyric 我不会要那五十刀的
Lyric, I would never take 50 bucks.

269
00:11:59,601 --> 00:12:00,844
就为那点小事
For something like that.

270
00:12:00,969 --> 00:12:03,737
如果你能找来七十五个 再来谈谈
Now if you can get the lady up to 75, come talk to me.

271
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,917
我尽力而为
I'll see what I can do.

272
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:07,951
有小费吗
Do I get a cut?

273
00:12:08,076 --> 00:12:10,287
如果你找来七十五个 我给你十五刀 
If you get 75, I'll give you 15.

274
00:12:10,412 --> 00:12:12,055
那要是八十个 能有二十刀吗
What if I get you 80? Can I get 20?

275
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,859
知女莫若母啊
My baby!

276
00:12:15,984 --> 00:12:18,129
你们俩搞什么呢
What is going on with you two?

277
00:12:18,254 --> 00:12:19,363
没什么
Nothing.

278
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,766
我正在谈生意呢
I'm just doing what's best for my business.

279
00:12:21,891 --> 00:12:23,535
就想你在为教堂拼死拼活一样样的
Like you're doing what's best for the church.

280
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,736
我不禁想起
You know, I just can't help but feel.

281
00:12:25,861 --> 00:12:27,238
我们都在铤而走险
We both made a deal with the devil.

282
00:12:27,363 --> 00:12:29,373
我不认为我是哦
Well, I don't think I did.

283
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,742
嗨 老板娘 我的支票簿呢
Hey, boss lady. You got my paycheck?

284
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:34,178
-就在这儿 - 好的
- Right here. - All right.

285
00:12:34,303 --> 00:12:36,080
你又要去哪里鬼混啊
Where are you going all slicked up, slick?

286
00:12:36,205 --> 00:12:37,215
我有个约会
I got a date.

287
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,183
我可要好好的约会哦
I met a little something-something today.

288
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:40,685
哇 哇 不要 告诉我
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Please don't tell me.

289
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:41,919
你在和我的顾客约会
You're dating one of my customers.

290
00:12:42,044 --> 00:12:44,021
我同意 但我不会告诉你的
Yeah, I agree. I shouldn't tell you about it.

291
00:12:44,146 --> 00:12:46,690
- Stamps - 别担心 老娘
- Stamps. - Don't worry, boss.

292
00:12:46,815 --> 00:12:48,425
这对生意后好处 相信我
This will be good for business, trust me.

293
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,161
这叫 顾客关系
I call it "customer relations."

294
00:12:51,286 --> 00:12:53,254
只是出去吃吃 喝喝
So I'm just gonna head out and go... Relate.

295
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:58,436
老天啊 我也许是在铤而走险
Oh, my god, maybe I did make a deal with the devil.

296
00:12:58,561 --> 00:12:59,604
这样看来
And in that case,

297
00:12:59,729 --> 00:13:01,606
还会赚到黑心钱
That would make this the devil's money.

298
00:13:01,731 --> 00:13:03,241
你不要 我要哦
You want me to take that off your hands?

299
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,610
休想
No.

300
00:13:05,735 --> 00:13:07,445
你要我霸王硬上弓吗?
Oh, you want to play "rob the bank."
