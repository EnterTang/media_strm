5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,760
我不能战斗  我不能走
I can't fight. I can't walk.

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,380
但是我还能做些事情
But i can do something

7
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,750
我们做了一个炸弹 sam
We got everything we need ,to build a bomb, sam.

8
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:23,100
-我们到底在干嘛  -猎鬼
-what are we doing? -we are hunting a gost

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,780
谁会那么做，疯子才会
who does that,crazy peopel

10
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,270
我们疯了
we are insane

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,210
明日我们要去猎杀首魔
Tomorrow we hunt the devil.

12
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,760
这是我们在世的最后一夜了
This is our last night on earth.

13
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:38,360
用这枪给我打爆lucifer的脸
Take this thing to lucifer and empty it into his face.

14
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,230
你知道我永远不会伤害你
You know I'd never hurt you.

15
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,270
你这王八蛋给我听着
You listen to me, you son of a bitch.

16
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,770
我会亲手杀了你
I'm gonna kill you myself.

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,010
把你的心挖出来
I'm going to rip your heart out!

18
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,210
那很好啊 sam
That's good, sam.

19
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,040
你继续燃烧你的满腔
You keep fanning that fire in your belly --

20
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,680
怒火吧
All that pent-up rage.

21
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:57,710
我会很需要的
I'm gonna need it.

22
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,230
护士们告诉我
The nurses tell me

23
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,730
你拒绝服药
That, uh, you're not taking your medication.

24
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,770
你想谈谈为什么吗?
You want to tell me why?

25
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,900
Susan
Susan?

26
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,700
药会让我很困
The pills make me sleepy,

27
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,140
可是我不能(睡)
But I can't...

28
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,740
如果我睡着了 它就会来
If I sleep, it'll come.

29
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,980
你是指'怪物'
You mean the monster.

30
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,280
我们已经谈过这件事了
Now, we have talked about this.

31
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,750
它杀了Annie
But it killed Annie.

32
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,320
Susan 你患有精神分裂症
Susan, you're schizophrenic.

33
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,960
你的思想很混乱
Your mind plays...Tricks on you.

34
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,320
神志根本不清楚
You get confused.

35
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,660
有时你就会有幻觉
Sometimes you see things.

36
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,260
我很清楚我的状况
I know what I am.

37
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,330
就像我能清楚的看到 我死去的孩子再在你身后一样
Like I can see my dead son standing right behind you --

38
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,100
我知道他并不存在
I know he's not real.

39
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,110
但是这怪物是真的
But the monster -- it is real.

40
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,680
Annie是你的室友
Annie was your roommate,

41
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,180
而在她身上发生的事
And what happened to her was painful --

42
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,520
对我们所有人的打击都很大
For all of us.

43
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,290
也许对你来说 想象出一个怪物
Perhaps it's easier for you to conjure umonster

44
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,090
比强迫自己去面对她的自杀 更简单一些
Than to face how tragic her suicide really was.

45
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,990
我夜里能听见它
I can hear it at night,

46
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,030
在墙壁中
In the walls.

47
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,800
求你
Please.

48
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,030
你得相信我
you have to believe me.

49
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,300
Susan
Susan...

50
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,170
世界上根本没有怪物
There is no such thing as monsters.

51
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,550
我的天哪!
Oh, my god!

52
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,860

53
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,820

54
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,860
他们今天晚上提前开始了啊
They're starting early tonight.

55
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,230
快来啊!
Hurry!

56
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,370
慢着! 不要理她!
Wait! Don't pay attention to her!

57
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,910
它来了!
It's coming!

58
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,240

59
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,810

61
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,510
啊!
Aaah!

62
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,820
叫人! 救我!
Get help. Help me.

63
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,590
你们是由芝加哥的一位Babar医生引荐来的
You were referred to me by a Dr. Babar in chicago.

64
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,820
是的
That's right.

65
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,660
好像有本儿童书籍 就是关于一只
Isn't there a children's book about an elephant

66
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,060
叫Babar的大象的?
named Babar?

67
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,090
我不知道
I don't know.

68
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,430
我没什么大象读物
I don't have any elephant books.

69
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,730
你看... 我觉得...
Look, doctor, I-I think that...

70
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,870
那位医生对这位根本束手无策
The Doc was in over his head with this one

71
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,700
因为我弟弟他有点...
Cause my brother's, uh...

72
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,070
好的 好的 谢了
Okay, fine. Thank you.

73
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,470
这-这完全没有必要
That's -- that's really not necessary.

74
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:53,710
Alex 你为什么不跟我讲讲你现在的感受
Why don't you tell me how you're feeling, alex?

75
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,680
我很好
I'm fine.

76
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,090
我是说 好吧 可能有点抑郁
I mean, okay, a little depressed, I guess.

77
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,460
好的 你觉得你为什么会这样
All right. Any idea why?

78
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,120
大概是因为我开启了天启吧
Probably because I started the apocalypse.

79
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,090
天启
The apocalypse?

80
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,260
嗯 没错
Yeah, that's right.

81
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,270
你认为你开启了它
And you think you started it.

82
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,900
呃 是啊
Well, yeah.

83
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,470
我是说
I-I mean

84
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,470
我杀了一个叫Lilith的恶魔
I killed this demon -- lilith --

85
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,540
不小心把Lucifer从地狱里放了出来
And I accidentally freed lucifer from hell.

86
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,380
所以现在他在人间 而我们正在设法阻止他的计划
So, now he's topside, and we're trying to stop him.

87
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,450
你和谁
W-who is?

88
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,750
我 和他
Me. And him.

89
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,920
还有 呃 一个天使
And, uh, this one angel.

90
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,920
哦 你是指你的良知
Oh, you mean like an angel on your shoulder?

91
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,220
不不 他的名字叫Castiel 他爱穿风衣
No, no. His name's castiel. He wears a trench coat.

92
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,930
你明白我的意思了吧 医生
See what I mean, doc?

93
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,730
这孩子因为这件事 沮丧了好几个月了
I mean, the kid's been beating himself up about this for months.

94
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,230
天启根本不是他的错
The apocalypse wasn't his fault.

95
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,030
不是吗
It's not?

96
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,040
不是
No.

97
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,640
还有另外一个恶魔 Ruby
There was this other demon -- Ruby.

98
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,370
她让他对恶魔血上了瘾
She got him addicte to demon blood.

99
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,610
到了最后 他几乎就是在用灌的
I mean, near the end, he was practically chugging the stuff.

100
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,550
我弟弟并不是恶人
My brother's not evil.

101
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,980
我是说 他只是
He was just...

102
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,380
High了
High.

103
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,850
是吗
Yeah?

104
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,690
所以你能不能治愈他我们好继续回到
So, could you fix him up so we can get back

105
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,790
周游美国猎杀怪物的旅途中呢
To traveling around the country and hunting monsters?

106
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,660
Erma
Erma...

107
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,700
退订我的午餐
Cancel my lunch.

108
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,170
Fuller医生希望你们两位都可以留院
Dr. Fuller would like to eep you both under observation

109
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,870
观察几天
For a couple of days.

110
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,210
两位 我也要吗
Both? Me too?

111
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,640
是的 甜心 医生认为这样最好
Yes, sugar. The doctor hinks that would be best.

112
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,450
好地 我只是给你来个小小的体检
All right. I'm just gonna give you a little checkup.

113
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,550
Ratched护士(电影角色名称) 我们把话先说清楚
All right, look, nurse ratched, let's get one thing straight --

114
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,720
我看过'飞越疯人院'(1975电影)
I've seen "Cuckoo's nest," So don't try

115
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,490
所以你甭想用你的那套镇压灵魂的权威来影响我
Any of that sou l-crushing authoritarian crap on me.

116
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,890
嗯
Hmm?

117
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,230
好啊
Okeydokey.

118
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,760
好地 现在你可以把裤子脱了
All right, you can go ahead and take down your pants.

119
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,070
等下 嗯
Wait. Mm.

120
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,070
为 为什么啊
What? What -- what for?

121
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,220
你的丝克伍澡怎么样啊 (1983年电影 丝克伍事件)
How was your silkwood shower?

122
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,620

125
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,330
护士有没有...

126
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,700
她做的非常全面
She was very thorough.

127
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,170
嗯 很好 很好
Yeah. Yeah good. Good. Yeah.

128
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,670
我不敢相信我竟然让你把我给劝进来了
I can't believe I let you talk me into this.

129
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,410
嘿 这是我们能该做的
Hey, it's the least we could do.

130
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,480
Martin救爸爸的次数 我们连数也数不过来
Martin saved dad's ass more times than we can count.

131
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,710
他是个很厉害的猎手
He's a great hunter.

132
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,650
曾经是 直到阿尔布开克(城市)事件
Was. Until Albuquerque.

133
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,080
再说了 我觉得我们最好还是保持忙碌 仅此而已
Besides, I-I just figure it's best we keep busy. That's all.

134
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,190
比什么好
Better than what?

135
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,190
没什么
Nothing.

136
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:55,560
好 听着 嗯

138
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,830
哦 行了吧 Sam 别说了

170
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,750
但这事情没多大进展
But that's not a lot to go on.

171
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,510
他们可信吗
Are they reliable?

172
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,180
哦 当然 为什么不可信呢
Oh, sure. Why wouldn't they be?

You cannot hit that.

281
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,510
噢 左右为难
Oh, so torn.

282
00:14:28,062 --> 00:14:29,532
终于 护士们已经开始巡逻了
About time. Nurses are on their rounds.

283
00:14:29,562 --> 00:14:32,002
我们有 大概 15 20分钟的时间 那家伙在哪
We got, like, 15, 20 minutes. Where is this guy?

284
00:14:32,032 --> 00:14:34,402
306房间
Room 306.

285
00:14:36,196 --> 00:14:37,396
噢 Geez
Oh! Geez!

286
00:14:43,848 --> 00:14:45,008

Hurry up! Come on! Hurry up!

287

Hey, back off, Dean!

288
00:15:19,582 --> 00:15:20,782

289
00:15:20,822 --> 00:15:22,752
你发现什么了 就在这
What do you got? Right here.

290
00:15:22,792 --> 00:15:24,522
嗯 搭把手
Um...Give me a hand.

291
00:15:27,992 --> 00:15:30,592
好的
All right.

292
00:15:42,872 --> 00:15:45,912
这个洞横穿过他的脑部
This hole goes all the way through to his brain.

293
00:15:45,942 --> 00:15:47,242
怎么回事
What does that mean?

294
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:50,882
咱看看怎么回事
Let's find out.

295
00:15:51,722 --> 00:15:52,982
说真的
Seriously?

296
00:15:53,022 --> 00:15:55,352
你门口看着人
You might want to keep watch.

297
00:16:22,012 --> 00:16:24,052
看他脑部被吸干了
Look,his brain's been sucked dry.

298
00:16:24,082 --> 00:16:26,182
太好了 有人来了
That's fascinating. Somebody's coming.

299
00:16:42,872 --> 00:16:44,502
你们俩在这儿干什么呢
What are you boys doing in here?

300
00:16:52,482 --> 00:16:54,512
布丁
Pudding!

301
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:57,612
好啦 出来吧 你们
All right. Come on, you two.

302
00:17:01,152 --> 00:17:02,222
装疯子哦
Crazy works.

303
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,132
是原版的Gacy啊(2003年电影)
Are those original Gacys?

304
00:17:15,172 --> 00:17:16,372
是我画的
I painted those.

305
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,032
讲重点吧
Back on point, please.

306
00:17:18,072 --> 00:17:21,002
额 不管怎么说挺 好的
Um so whatever this thing is... Good.

307
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:23,212
溜进你的脑袋 把它 吸干
...I-it silps in your brain - sucks you dry.

308
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:26,712
嗯 是死者看上去像自杀
Yeah, then it makes the deaths look like suicides.

309
00:17:26,742 --> 00:17:28,142
有想法么
Any ideas?

310
00:17:30,822 --> 00:17:32,652
嗯
Yeah.

311
00:17:32,682 --> 00:17:35,192
坏想法
A bad one.

312
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:36,922
什么
What is it?

313
00:17:36,952 --> 00:17:39,862
额 我愿意赌你一顿鸡肉晚餐 这绝对就是我们要应付的东西
Well, I bet you a chicken dinner it's what we're up against.

314
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:40,962
死灵
A wraith.

315
00:17:41,892 --> 00:17:44,762
他们撬开头骨以脑浆为食
They crack open skulls and feed on brain juice.

316
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:47,102
你往这方面想过么
You ever tangle with one before?

317
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:49,102
也不想往那想
Never wanted to, neither.

318
00:17:49,132 --> 00:17:51,032
怎么消灭它
So how to kill it?

319
00:17:51,072 --> 00:17:52,272
银器
Silver.

320
00:17:52,302 --> 00:17:54,402
你得用银器接触死灵
You so much as touch a wraith with the stuff,

321
00:17:54,442 --> 00:17:55,612
他们皮肤会剥落
And the skin will crackle.

322
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:57,212
这是好消息
Now, that's the good news.

323
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,882
坏消息是 他们可以化为人型
The bad news is... They can pass as humans.

324
00:18:01,412 --> 00:18:04,412
可以是随便是拐角哪个叫Peter,Paul,Mary的什么人
It could be any Peter, Paul, or Mary in the joint.

325
00:18:04,452 --> 00:18:06,882
好啊 怎么找出死灵
Fantastic. So how do we find it?

326
00:18:06,922 --> 00:18:09,092
镜子
A-a mirror.

327
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:13,092
主说死灵真身镜中现
Lore says a wraith will show its true form in a mirror.

328
00:18:13,122 --> 00:18:14,792
好 那咱们就逐一排查
Okay, well, we just got to spot-check

329
00:18:14,832 --> 00:18:16,492
所有病人和医院员工
Every patient and every staff member.

330
00:18:16,532 --> 00:18:18,092
好的
Okay. Yeah.

331
00:18:18,132 --> 00:18:20,962
但 它为什么要在精神病院
But, I mean, what's it doing in a mental hospital?

332
00:18:21,002 --> 00:18:22,172
精神病院
A nuthouse --

333
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:24,102
简直就是完美的猎物聚居区
It's -- it's -- I's a perfect captive victim pool.

334
00:18:24,142 --> 00:18:25,642
对啊
Sure.

335
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:27,302
谁会相信精神病人
Who -- who's gonna believe a patient

336
00:18:27,342 --> 00:18:29,442
当他们说自己看到妖怪了
When they say they saw a monster?

337
00:18:29,472 --> 00:18:31,512
完美猎场啊
It's the perfect hunting ground.

338
00:18:43,152 --> 00:18:45,162
怎么了 医生
What's up, doc?

339
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:47,662
你告诉我
You tell me.

340
00:18:47,692 --> 00:18:49,232
猎魔
Hunting.

341
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,062
猎死灵 实际上
A wraith, actually.

342
00:18:51,102 --> 00:18:53,002
谁都有可能是
Could be anybody.

343
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:55,102
那 我也有可能喽
So... I could be a monster?

344
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:59,642
你没嫌疑
No. You're clean.

345
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:00,872
为什么
Why you?

346
00:19:00,912 --> 00:19:02,512
什么
Why me what?

347
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,272
为什么要猎魔呢
Why do you have to hunt monsters?

348
00:19:04,312 --> 00:19:05,942
为什么不让别人做呢
Why not let someone else do it?

349
00:19:07,952 --> 00:19:11,452
找不着跟我一样憨的
I can't find anybody else that dumb.

350
00:19:14,722 --> 00:19:16,452
是我的工作
It's my job.

351
00:19:16,492 --> 00:19:18,762
别人还忙着就其他人哪
Somebody's got to save people's asses.

352
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:20,292
也包括你
Yours included.

353
00:19:20,322 --> 00:19:22,292
嗯 还有配额
So, is there a quota?

354
00:19:22,332 --> 00:19:24,532
你要救多少人
How many people do you have to save?

355
00:19:24,562 --> 00:19:25,562
所有人
All of them.

356
00:19:25,602 --> 00:19:27,202
所有人
All of them?

357
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:28,972
你觉得自己能拯救世人
You think you have to save everyone?

358
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:31,102
嗯 拯救全世界
Yep. Whole wide world of sports.

359
00:19:31,142 --> 00:19:31,902
怎么做
How?

360
00:19:35,172 --> 00:19:37,742
相信我 不管你说什么 怪事我见多了
Believe me -- whatever you've got, I've heard weirder.

361
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:43,012
这是世界末日啊
It's the end of the world, okay?

362
00:19:43,052 --> 00:19:45,822
是该死的天启你懂么
I mean, it's the damn biblical apocalypse.

363
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:48,592
我不去阻止它 拯救大家
And if I don't stop it and save everyone,

364
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:50,922
没人可以 我们都得死
Then no one will and we all die.

365
00:19:50,962 --> 00:19:53,622
那很糟哦
That's horrible.

366
00:19:53,662 --> 00:19:55,292
说的是
Yeah, tell me about it.

367
00:19:55,332 --> 00:19:57,762
我是说 无论是否天启
I mean, apocalypse or no apocalypse,

368
00:19:57,802 --> 00:19:59,332
有没有恶魔
Monsters or no monsters,

369
00:19:59,362 --> 00:20:01,202
你肩头有着让人崩溃的责任
That's a crushing weight to have on your shoulders.

370
00:20:02,572 --> 00:20:05,702
感觉六十亿人的命运都取决于你
To feel like six billion lives depend on you.

371
00:20:06,742 --> 00:20:08,872
上帝啊
God.

372
00:20:08,912 --> 00:20:11,342
你每天清晨是在怎样的心情中醒来的
How do you get up in the morning?

373
00:20:15,252 --> 00:20:17,412
问的好
That's a good question.

374
00:20:17,452 --> 00:20:19,222
你好 Eddie
Hello, eddie.

375

Doc.

376
00:20:35,002 --> 00:20:36,272
好吧
All right.

377
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:38,872
我找了三个护士站才找到这些
I had to raid three nurses' stations to get these.

378
00:20:38,902 --> 00:20:41,402
它们只是镀银的 但是仍旧有用
They're only silver-plated, but they should work.

379
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:44,942

00:21:00,122 --> 00:21:01,622
他更强壮
He's larger.

384
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,132
嗯
Hmm.

385
00:21:09,472 --> 00:21:13,672
我们遇见过更糟的
You've had worse.

386
00:21:13,702 --> 00:21:15,242
Fuller今晚值班
Fuller is on call tonight,

387
00:21:15,272 --> 00:21:17,572
所以 我们要在没人的时候除掉他
So we'll have to hit him after lights out.

388
00:21:17,612 --> 00:21:18,982
我们三个
All thre us.

389
00:21:19,012 --> 00:21:20,582
什么 不
What? No!

390
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,882
Martin 我们要通过安全系统
Martin, we got to get past the security,

391
00:21:22,912 --> 00:21:24,012
通过看护人员
Past the orderlies,

392
00:21:24,052 --> 00:21:25,752
然后割破那人的喉咙
And then cut the boss man's throat, okay?

393
00:21:25,782 --> 00:21:27,182
我们会结束这一切
It's gonna suck start to finish,

394
00:21:27,222 --> 00:21:28,452
但是我们需要后援
But we could use the backup.

395
00:21:28,492 --> 00:21:30,052
不 我不行
No, I can't.

396
00:21:30,092 --> 00:21:31,152
我不行
I can't.

397
00:21:31,192 --> 00:21:33,162
我们知道在albuquerque发生了什么
We know what happened in albuquerque.

398
00:21:35,332 --> 00:21:37,662
你们不了解全部
You don't know the half of it.

399
00:21:37,702 --> 00:21:41,302
上帝啊 我曾经和你们一样
God...I used to be just like you two.

400
00:21:41,332 --> 00:21:43,472
我曾经以为我是不可战胜的
I used to think I was invincible.

401
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:45,132
然后
And then...

402
00:21:45,172 --> 00:21:46,742
我发现 我不是不可战胜的
Well, I found out I'm not.

403
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:48,642
Martin 你仍旧是个猎人
Martin. You are still a hunter.

404
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,072

我没用了
I'm useless!

408
00:21:55,412 --> 00:21:57,082
我也想
I would.

409
00:21:57,112 --> 00:21:59,822
但是 我不行了
But I-I can't.

410
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:02,392
对不起 我做不到

他还在这栋楼里
He's still in the building.

412

You take the west wing. I'll take the east.

413
00:23:02,312 --> 00:23:03,512

No! No!

415
00:23:26,602 --> 00:23:28,102
看他的手臂
Look at his arm!

416
00:23:28,142 --> 00:23:30,612
伤口没有出现烧焦的痕迹
The cut's not burning!

417
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:31,612
不是他
It's not him!

418
00:23:31,642 --> 00:23:33,182
不是他
It's not him.

419
00:23:55,915 --> 00:23:56,945

You okay?

420
00:23:58,115 --> 00:23:59,215

Awesome!

425
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:09,689
他们给你吃了什么
They give you something?

426
00:24:09,729 --> 00:24:10,689
哦 是的
Oh, yeah.

427
00:24:10,729 --> 00:24:12,899
他们 他们给了我一切
They -- they gave me everything.

428
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:14,199
它
It...

429
00:24:14,229 --> 00:24:17,929
叹 叹为观止
It's spectacu...cular.

430
00:24:19,199 --> 00:24:20,799
你永远是一个快乐的酗酒者
You always were a happy drunk.

431
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,509
Dean
Dean...

432
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:30,349
那个医生不是幽灵
The doctor wasn't a wraith.

433
00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:31,579
我知道
I know.

434
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:33,519
我不明白
I don't understand it.

435
00:24:33,549 --> 00:24:35,989
我的意思是 我在镜子里看见了 他不是人类
I mean, I saw it in the mirror. It wasn't human.

436
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:38,459
或者 你那是幻觉
Or you're seeing things.

437
00:24:38,489 --> 00:24:40,819
也许 也许 你疯了
Maybe -- m-maybe - maybe you're going crazy.

438
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:42,029
我没疯
I'm not crazy.

439
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:43,759
好吧 来
Well, come on.

440
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:47,999
我的意思是 你至少 在很长一段时间里 是不太正常的
I mean, you've been at least... Half crazy for a long time.

441
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:49,699
从你从地狱回来之后
Since you got back from hell --

442
00:24:49,729 --> 00:24:51,229
或者 甚至在那之前
Or since before that, even.

443
00:24:51,269 --> 00:24:53,599
而且我们在 我们在一个精神病院
And we're in a - we're in a mental hospital.

444
00:24:54,909 --> 00:24:57,009
或许 或许你最终精神分裂了
Ma-maybe -- maybe you finally cracked.

445
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,279
你知道 也许
You know, maybe --

446
00:24:58,309 --> 00:25:03,649
也许 现在 你真的 真的疯了
Maybe now you are really, for-real crazy.

447
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,179
我知道是我的错
I made a mistake  That's all

448
00:25:06,219 --> 00:25:07,449
不过 我会把他找出来的
I'll find the thing

449
00:25:07,489 --> 00:25:10,449
好的 我知道你会的
Okay Yeah yeah yeah yeah I know I know.

450
00:25:10,489 --> 00:25:11,889
没关系的
It's okay  Hey

451
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,919
嗨 看着我
Hey   look at me

452
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:16,229
这些都不重要
It's okay...

453
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:19,429
因为你是我哥哥
Cause you're my broter...

454
00:25:19,459 --> 00:25:21,229
我依然爱着你
And I still love ya

455
00:25:22,469 --> 00:25:23,729
额
Mm

456
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,339
啵
Boop

457
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:35,379
今天的治疗你怎么没来
You missed our session today

458
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:36,409
我没时间
I'm a little busy

459
00:25:36,449 --> 00:25:37,709
你还在找那个鬼魂啊
Still hunting that wraith

460
00:25:37,749 --> 00:25:39,079
我不能看着人们一个个死去
People are dying

461
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:40,849
这是自然规律 每时每刻都有人死去啊
People die all the time

462
00:25:40,889 --> 00:25:41,879
听着 我的女士 请你
Look lady why don't you

463
00:25:41,879 --> 00:25:43,619
不要打扰我的工作  这也许是在救你的命
just let me do my job  maybe save your life

464
00:25:43,649 --> 00:25:45,259
我并不担心我的生命 我担心的是你
It's not my life that I'm worried about

465
00:25:45,289 --> 00:25:47,589
天哪 别说了 我很好 不需要你担心
Oh my go I am fine okay

466
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:48,659
真的 我很好
I'm fine

467
00:25:49,989 --> 00:25:52,829
别骗自己了 连你自己都不相信那写鬼魂的事情 对吧
Come on  Even you don't believe that

468
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:54,929
你给自己的压力太大了
All this pressure that you're putting yourself under

469
00:25:54,969 --> 00:25:57,699
这些负罪感会让你窒息的
All this guilt,it's killing you

470
00:25:57,739 --> 00:25:59,799
你不可能拯救所有人
You can't save everybody

471
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:01,099
你不能
You can't

472
00:26:01,139 --> 00:26:04,469
该死的 Dean 这些天你救过谁
Hell  these days  you can't save anybody Dean

473
00:26:04,509 --> 00:26:06,509
你说什么 Dean 不要逃避 我说的是事实
What'd you say  The truth  dean

474
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:08,179
你让Ellen和Jo都死掉了
You got Ellen and Jo killed

475
00:26:08,209 --> 00:26:10,279
你对着Lucifer开枪  可你却杀不了他
You shot Lucifer,but you couldn't gank him

476
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:11,849
你甚至阻止不了sam杀死lilith
You couldn't stop sam from killing lilith

477
00:26:11,879 --> 00:26:14,119
对了 是你打破的第一个封印
And oh yeah you broke the first seal

478
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:16,689
你做的一切都失败了
All you do is fail

479
00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:18,889
Dean 你真的认为就凭你一个人
Did you really think that you Dean Winchester

480
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:20,919
拿了个本科毕业证  加上你那些让他们下地狱的妄想
With a G.E.D. And a give-'em-hell attitude

481
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:22,159
就能够杀死那些恶魔
Were gonna beat the devil

482
00:26:22,189 --> 00:26:23,489
你太天真了
Please

483
00:26:23,529 --> 00:26:25,229
这个世界就要毁灭了
The world is gonna burn

484
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:27,499
你只能坐以待毙
And there is nothing that you can do about it

485
00:26:27,529 --> 00:26:28,969
你是谁
Who are you

486
00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:30,629
你怎么知道这些
How do you know that stuff

487
00:26:30,669 --> 00:26:32,499
嗨 伙计 别闹了
Hey  Settle down

488
00:26:32,539 --> 00:26:34,669
告诉我
Tell me

489
00:26:34,709 --> 00:26:37,739
我说了 别闹了
I said settle down

490
00:26:40,979 --> 00:26:43,349
你是
Are you...

491
00:26:43,379 --> 00:26:44,779
她是谁
Who is she

492
00:26:45,719 --> 00:26:46,679
谁
Who

493
00:26:46,719 --> 00:26:48,819
你瞎了啊 她就站在这啊
What are you blind,her

494
00:26:48,849 --> 00:26:50,619
伙计 那根本没人啊
Pal,there's nobody there

495
00:26:58,029 --> 00:27:00,159
Dean 我不是真实存在的
I'm not real,Dean

496
00:27:00,199 --> 00:27:02,499
我潜伏在你的脑子里
I'm in your head...

497
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:06,299
因为你快疯掉了
Cause you are going crazy

498
00:27:13,579 --> 00:27:15,049
让我一个人呆会
Just leave me alone

499
00:27:57,089 --> 00:27:58,859
你要见我么
You asked to see me

500
00:27:58,889 --> 00:28:00,659
是的 谢谢你能来
Yeah.Thanks

501
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:04,059
额 我
I  um...

502
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,829
我只是想向您道歉
I just wanted to apologize

503
00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:08,529
我对我多做的一切感到十分的抱歉
I feel horrible about what I did to you

504
00:28:08,569 --> 00:28:10,729
我还以为你是个恶魔
I thought you were a monster

505
00:28:10,769 --> 00:28:13,439
我知道
I know that

506
00:28:13,469 --> 00:28:15,469
但是 我想不通的是为什么
The question is,why

507
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:21,239
我
I I was..

508
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,649
这些都无所谓 嗯
It doesn't matter  um...

509
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,479
因为经历了昨晚的一切
Because after what happened last night

510
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:27,279
我有
I,I had a...

511
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:28,749
一刻让我感到了身边的人的宽厚
Moment of clarity

512
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:30,019
额
Um...

513
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:34,889
我知道这里根本没有恶魔
I realized there's no such thing as monsters

514
00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:42,569
我很高兴你能这么说
Well,I'm...Glad to hear you say that

515
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:44,399
但是 老实说
But honestly

516
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:47,439
至少恶魔的问题还是你的精神上的问题
Monsters are the least of your problems

517
00:28:47,469 --> 00:28:51,209
人们可以学会在幻觉中生活
People can learn to live with delusions

518
00:28:51,239 --> 00:28:52,939
但是 我在你眼中看到了愤怒
But the anger I saw in you

519
00:28:52,979 --> 00:28:54,709
我
I...

520
00:28:54,749 --> 00:28:58,419
你伤害了那两个人 你差点杀了他们
You hurt those two men and you were going to kill me

521
00:28:58,449 --> 00:29:01,149
当你追赶我时 你的眼神
The look in your eyes when you came after me

522
00:29:01,189 --> 00:29:03,419
我
I...

523
00:29:03,449 --> 00:29:05,859
就好像你几乎不是个有自控能力人
It was like you were barely even human

524
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,729
像一个被附身的人
Like a man possessed

525
00:29:16,329 --> 00:29:17,729
我知道
I know

526
00:29:21,639 --> 00:29:24,869
对不起
Please...

527
00:29:24,909 --> 00:29:27,809
只是
Just...

528
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,779
你能再给我一次机会吗
Could you give me a second chance

529
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:35,189
恩 这里不是监狱
Well,this isn't a prison

530
00:29:35,219 --> 00:29:37,519
我允许你呆在休息室里
You'll be allowed to go to the day room

531
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:38,789
不过 要被监管
Under supervision

532
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:40,459
好的 谢谢
Thank you

533
00:29:42,729 --> 00:29:45,499
不过 如果你的精神病再一次发作
But if there is one more outburst

534
00:29:45,529 --> 00:29:48,259
我会把你绑在一台机器上
I wll transfer you to a facility

535
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:50,599
一台专门解决有暴力问题病人的机器
That's equipped to handle violent patients

536
00:29:50,629 --> 00:29:55,469
相信我 他们可没有我这么仁慈
And believe me they will be far far less forgiving

537
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:04,879
嗨 Dean
Dean. Hey.

538
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:05,979
呃 怎么了
Whoa. What's wrong?

539
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,649
那跟恶魔血没有关系 sam
It's not the demon blood, sam.

540
00:30:10,689 --> 00:30:11,959
从来都没有
It never was.

541
00:30:11,989 --> 00:30:13,359
什么?
What?

542
00:30:13,389 --> 00:30:15,019
有问题的是你
The problem was you.

543
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:17,389
一直都是你
It was always you --

544
00:30:17,429 --> 00:30:20,559
那些谎言 你的傲慢
The lies, your arrogance,

545
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:22,999
还有你灵魂上的黑点
That black spot on your soul.

546
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:25,169
因为你 现在我们都得死
Now we're all gonna die because of you.

547
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:27,299
那全是你的错 是你害了我们
It's all your fault! You killed all of us!

548
00:30:27,339 --> 00:30:28,509
可悲的怪物
Pathetic freak!

549
00:30:28,539 --> 00:30:29,809
你这个XXX的恶魔
You evil son of a bitch!

550
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:31,139
笨蛋
Loser!

551
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:33,179
我们全都会死 怪物
We're all gonna die! Freak!

552
00:30:33,209 --> 00:30:34,209
笨蛋
Loser!

553
00:30:35,949 --> 00:30:36,909
怪物
Freak!

554
00:30:38,849 --> 00:30:39,819
啊
Aah!

555
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:44,389
别来烦我
Leave me alone!

556
00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:45,989
别来烦我
Leave me alone!!

557
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:47,919
别来烦我
Leave me alone! No!

558
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:50,329
快停下 别来烦我
Stop it! Leave me alone!

559
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:52,329
离我远一点 我什么都没做
Leave me alone! I didn't do it!

560
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:55,229
我说离我远一点 这根本不关我的事
Get off of me! Leave me alone!

561
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:57,569
噢 不
Aah! No!

562
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:59,439
离我远一点
Leave me alone!

563
00:30:59,469 --> 00:31:02,309
怎么了
What's happening?

564
00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:04,239
发生了什么
What's happening?

565
00:31:16,989 --> 00:31:18,449
Martin Martin 是我 我是Dean
Martin, martin, it's me! It's dean!

566
00:31:18,489 --> 00:31:19,959
哦 对不起
Oh. Sorry.

567
00:31:21,959 --> 00:31:24,889
你看上去很不好
You -- you look like hell, boy.

568
00:31:24,929 --> 00:31:26,399
我感觉很不好
I feel -- I feel like it, too.

569
00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:27,429
Sam在哪里
Where's sam?

570
00:31:27,459 --> 00:31:28,599
被锁起来了
Lockdown.

571
00:31:28,629 --> 00:31:30,799
感谢上帝 他疯了
He went crazy, thank god.

572
00:31:30,829 --> 00:31:31,699
什么?
What?

573
00:31:31,739 --> 00:31:33,469
我也快疯了
I'm going crazy, too.

574
00:31:33,499 --> 00:31:36,109
我现在有幻觉 还会幻听
I'm seeing things. I'm hearing things.

575
00:31:36,139 --> 00:31:38,409
我们两个都是
W-we both are.

576
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:39,939
『疯』就是线索
Crazy's the clue.

577
00:31:39,979 --> 00:31:41,209
你是什么意思
W-what do you mean?

578
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,919
-Dean -『疯』就是线索
-Dean? -Crazy's the clue.

579
00:31:46,949 --> 00:31:48,819
是 你说过了 究竟怎么?
Y-you said that. What?

580
00:31:48,849 --> 00:31:50,489
我的意思是 我和Sam做过的那些事
I mean, the things that me and sam have done,

581
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:52,459
那些... 我们见过的东西
The -- the stuff we've seen --

582
00:31:52,489 --> 00:31:54,689
我们早晚有一天都会秀逗的
We're gonna end up going guano eventually,

583
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:57,289
很可能最后我们都会变成两个流着口水的老疯子
Probably end up like a couple of drooling nutbags.

584
00:31:58,429 --> 00:31:59,799
没有冒犯的意思
No offense.

585
00:31:59,829 --> 00:32:01,729
没事
None taken.

586
00:32:01,769 --> 00:32:04,799
但是我和他在同一天 一起疯了
But me and him freaking out on the same day?

587
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:07,139
我的意思是 那绝对...
I mean, it -- it -- it's got to be the...

588
00:32:07,169 --> 00:32:09,069
-怪物 -在哪里 在哪里
-The monster. -What?! Where? Where?

589
00:32:09,109 --> 00:32:10,909
不 不 那里什么都没有
No, not -- no, there's nothing there.

590
00:32:10,939 --> 00:32:12,839
你看
Look...

591
00:32:15,249 --> 00:32:17,909
如果这个怪物不是以疯子为食的话怎么办?
...What if this thing doesn't feed on the insane?

592
00:32:17,949 --> 00:32:21,049
也许就是它让人们疯发疯
What if it makes people insane?

593
00:32:22,689 --> 00:32:24,719
这可能吗? 这看起来像真的吗?
Is that possible? Does -- does that seem real?

594
00:32:26,659 --> 00:32:29,829
呃 我... 我不是很可靠的
Well, I-I'm -- I'm not the most reliable source

595
00:32:29,859 --> 00:32:31,189
在什么是'真实的'这一点上
On what is "Real,"

596
00:32:31,229 --> 00:32:33,459
但那听起来 有道理
But it sounds -- makes sense.

597
00:32:33,499 --> 00:32:34,899
好吧
Okay.

598
00:32:34,929 --> 00:32:37,469
好吧 所以假设我们被感染了
Okay, so -- s-so we got infected.

599
00:32:37,499 --> 00:32:39,269
呃 什么东西让我们疯狂了
You know, something shot us up with crazy.

600
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:40,539
你知道的 一些...
You know, something...

601
00:32:43,239 --> 00:32:45,309
或许...
Maybe...

602
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:47,309
也许是我父亲的鬼魂
Maybe it was the ghost of my dad.

603
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:49,049
不
No.

604
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:50,849
重点是亡灵 Dean
Focus on the wraith, dean.

605
00:32:50,879 --> 00:32:53,149
这是重点 对 亡灵 那个亡灵
Focus! Right, the wraith. The wraith.

606
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,049
好吧 所以那只亡灵
Okay, so the wraith -- the wraith.

607
00:32:55,089 --> 00:32:56,349
它 它对我们下了毒
It -- it poisoned us.

608
00:32:56,389 --> 00:32:57,789
它...
It...

609
00:32:57,819 --> 00:33:01,059
也许是有毒的 你知道 通过触摸
Maybe with venom, you know, by t-- by touch.

610
00:33:01,089 --> 00:33:04,859
或者是有毒的液体 比如... 唾液
Or -- or -- or venom or, um, saliva.

611
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,329
Wendy
Wendy.

612
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:08,529
Wendy
Wendy?

613
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:11,629
就是她 我和Sam身上到处都是她的口水
Wendy! Wendy slobbered all over me and sam!

614
00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:13,569
我们就是这样被感染的
That's how we got infected!

615
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:35,889
我不能踩裂缝
I can't step on the cracks.

616
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:50,169
这是真的吗?
Is this real?

617
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:02,089
哦 是的 甜心
Oh, it is, sugar.

618
00:34:03,219 --> 00:34:04,389
真的不能再真了
It's very real.

619
00:34:09,652 --> 00:34:27,032
啊
Aaah!

620
00:34:42,605 --> 00:34:44,005
她还活着
She's still alive!

621
00:34:45,845 --> 00:34:48,045
Wendy的房间里有两个病人
There's two patients in Wendy's room.

622
00:34:48,075 --> 00:34:49,885
他们袭击了我
They attacked me.

623
00:34:56,125 --> 00:34:57,785
Dean  你听得到我说话吗?
Dean? Can you hear me?

624
00:34:57,825 --> 00:34:59,695
Dean!
Dean!

625
00:34:59,725 --> 00:35:02,425
你必须离开这里 并且杀了那个东西
You've got to get out there and kill that thing.

626
00:35:02,465 --> 00:35:04,925
我会照顾她的
I'll take care of her.

627
00:35:06,565 --> 00:35:08,665
我 我不行
I-I can't.

628
00:35:08,705 --> 00:35:11,205
你必须得去 孩子 你现在没有选择
You have to. You have no choice, son.

629
00:35:13,535 --> 00:35:15,775
走
go!

630
00:35:15,805 --> 00:35:17,045
Dean 快走
Dean, run!

631
00:35:17,075 --> 00:35:18,005
走啊
Run!

632
00:35:40,835 --> 00:35:42,735
嘿 放开我
Hey! Let me go!

633
00:35:44,135 --> 00:35:45,365
不行
No.

634
00:35:45,405 --> 00:35:48,335
你太愤怒了 绝对不能放你回到现实世界
You are far too angry to be out there in the real world.

635
00:35:51,575 --> 00:35:53,745
-是你! -当然是我
-You! -Of course it's me.

636
00:35:54,615 --> 00:35:58,645
我说真的 你们猎手 真的是闻名不如见面啊
I got to say, you hunters don't exactly live up to your rep.

637
00:35:58,685 --> 00:36:01,755
我说 Martin根本一无是处 一点威胁也没有
I mean, martin's a wreck. He's harmless.

638
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:03,925
然后你和你哥来到这里
And you and your brother come in here,

639
00:36:03,955 --> 00:36:05,955
叫嚷着要杀怪物
Talking tough about killing monsters?

640
00:36:05,995 --> 00:36:08,995
真的很惹人注意
Kind of made you easy to spot.

641
00:36:09,025 --> 00:36:11,595
然后我只需轻轻一碰...
Then all it took was a touch...

642
00:36:14,135 --> 00:36:16,335
你就是我的了
...And you were mine.

643
00:36:16,365 --> 00:36:19,465
...哦 我太喜欢这里了
Oh, I love it in here.

644
00:36:19,505 --> 00:36:23,175
这地方可是我的私人五星级餐馆
This place is my own personal five-star restaurant.

645
00:36:23,205 --> 00:36:24,775
嗯
Mmm.

646
00:36:25,875 --> 00:36:27,975
嗯
Mmm.

647
00:36:27,975 --> 00:36:33,615
疯子们的大脑 里面被灌满了多巴胺和肾上腺素
Crazy brains -- they get soaked in dopamine and adrenaline

648
00:36:33,655 --> 00:36:36,155
还有各种各样的激素和化学物质
And just all sorts of hormones and chemicals

649
00:36:36,185 --> 00:36:38,585
真的是 太可口了
That make them delicious.

650
00:36:40,155 --> 00:36:43,495
而且 他们越疯癫 吃起来就越美味
And crazier they are, the better they taste.

651
00:36:43,525 --> 00:36:44,895
这一切都是你干的
You did this to me!

652
00:36:46,395 --> 00:36:48,795
呃 我只是帮了点忙而已
Well...I helped.

653
00:36:48,835 --> 00:36:49,965
但是那些怒火
But that rage?

654
00:36:50,005 --> 00:36:51,705
不不不 那可都是你
No, no, no, no. That's all you.

655
00:36:51,735 --> 00:36:55,805
我不能把人变疯 我只是刺激一下那些已经存在的情感而已
I don't make crazy. I just crank up what's already there.

656
00:36:55,845 --> 00:36:57,475
是你们自己画地为牢的
You build your own hell.

657
00:36:57,505 --> 00:36:59,105
我只是提供砖块而已
But I give you the legos.

658
00:36:59,145 --> 00:37:01,315
而当你们成熟了以后...
And when you're ripe...

659
00:37:03,645 --> 00:37:06,985
我就会让你们的忧虑 全部消失
...I make all of your problems dsappear.

660
00:37:10,225 --> 00:37:11,685
你给我离他远点
You get away from him!

661
00:37:12,955 --> 00:37:15,225
你以为你这样真的会有好的结果吗 小子
Do you really think this is gonna end well for you, kiddo?

662
00:37:16,365 --> 00:37:17,395
不
No.

663
00:37:19,895 --> 00:37:22,695
不过反正我已经疯了 豁出去算了
But I'm crazy, so what the hell.

664
00:38:02,775 --> 00:38:03,975
啊!
Aaaah!

665
00:38:25,225 --> 00:38:26,765
你还是疯子吗?
You still crazy?

666
00:38:29,505 --> 00:38:31,165
也就和平常一样疯吧
Not any more than usual.

667
00:38:32,805 --> 00:38:34,575
-我们得赶快离开 -是啊
-We got to get out of here. -Yeah.

668
00:38:48,335 --> 00:38:51,905
看起来Tom Cruise没错啊 医生们都是混蛋
Well, looks like Tom cruise was right. Shrinks suck.

669
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:55,275
你怎么了
What are you doing?

670
00:38:55,315 --> 00:38:56,715
Sammy 你没事吧
Sammy you okay?

671
00:38:57,405 --> 00:38:58,535
我有事
No.

672
00:38:58,565 --> 00:39:00,235
-不 那只亡灵 -怎么
-No, the wraith -what about her?

673
00:39:00,265 --> 00:39:01,805
她说的对
She was right.

674
00:39:01,835 --> 00:39:03,835
不 她说的很错 她已经死了 好不好
No, she wasn't. She's dead, okay?

675
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:06,475
我们上路吧 我得来瓶酒 也许12瓶...
Let's hit the road. I need a drink. Or 12.

676
00:39:06,505 --> 00:39:09,215
平时我能把这情绪隐藏起来
Most of the time I can hide it,

677
00:39:09,245 --> 00:39:11,315
但是 我真的很生气
But...I am angry.

678
00:39:11,345 --> 00:39:13,185
我几乎对什么都看不顺眼
I'm mad at everything.

679
00:39:13,215 --> 00:39:15,085
以前我是气你和老爸
I used to be mad at you and dad,

680
00:39:15,115 --> 00:39:16,885
之后是Lilith 而现在是Lucifer
Then Lilith, now it's lucifer.

681
00:39:16,915 --> 00:39:19,725
而 而且我还给自己找理由 我怪Ruby或是恶魔血
A-and I make excuses. I blame ruby or the demon blood.

682
00:39:19,755 --> 00:39:22,795
但这不是他们的错 错的人其实是我
But it's not their fault. It's not them. It's me.

683
00:39:22,825 --> 00:39:24,865
都是我心底的那些...
It's inside me.

684
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:29,165
我根本每一刻都在发怒...
I am mad all the time...

685
00:39:29,195 --> 00:39:30,895
而连我都不知道为什么
And I don't know why.

686
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,305
够了 别说了
Okay, stop.

687
00:39:33,335 --> 00:39:34,765
别再说了
Stop it.

688
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,975
就算你是又怎样
So what if you are?

689
00:39:39,005 --> 00:39:41,975
你想怎么办 请个假
What are you gonna do, take a leave of absence?

690
00:39:42,015 --> 00:39:43,815
你打算对Lucifer臣服
You gonna say yes to lucifer?

691
00:39:43,845 --> 00:39:44,975
什么
What?

692
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:46,115
不 我当然不会 我-
No, of course not. I --

693
00:39:46,145 --> 00:39:47,115
没错
Exactly.

694
00:39:48,655 --> 00:39:50,115
而你就是要这样做
And that's exactly what you're gonna do.

695
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:51,485
你必须把你的那些乱七八糟的情绪整理好
You're gonna take all that crap,

696
00:39:51,525 --> 00:39:52,855
然后深深的埋到心底
And you're gonna bury it.

697
00:39:52,885 --> 00:39:54,125
然后遗忘
You're gonna forget about it...

698
00:39:54,155 --> 00:39:55,855
因为只有这样我们才能继续
Because that's how we keep going.

699
00:39:55,895 --> 00:39:59,325
只有这样我们才不会有一天变得和Martin一样!
That's how we don't end up like Martin!

700
00:40:01,835 --> 00:40:03,195
你跟我吗?
Are you with me?

701
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,905
说话 你究竟跟不跟我?
Come on, man. Are you with me?

702
00:40:09,735 --> 00:40:11,305
我跟你
I'm with you.

703
00:40:12,645 --> 00:40:14,005
那就好
Good.

704
00:40:17,845 --> 00:40:19,715
我们走吧
Let's get the hell out of here.
