2
00:00:24,715 --> 00:00:27,315
Must be an easier
way of taking off those trainers.

3
00:00:30,595 --> 00:00:32,114
Tonight on Channel 5,

4
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:36,235
the tragic story of the girl that
was born with no knees or elbows.

5
00:00:37,675 --> 00:00:40,674
I can't believe you're doing all
this training just for a fun run.

6
00:00:40,675 --> 00:00:42,274
Fun run?

7
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,474
Well, it's not exactly
a serious race, is it?

8
00:00:44,475 --> 00:00:47,914
I bet you'll see more
Honey Monsters than Kenyans.

9
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:50,034
It's still 10km!

10
00:00:50,035 --> 00:00:53,074
Imagine having to run to
the supermarket, then back,

11
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:55,754
then again, then back,
and then again, and then back.

12
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:57,594
Easy. You reckon?

13
00:00:57,595 --> 00:00:59,075
Yeah, I'd use Ocado.

14
00:01:00,275 --> 00:01:02,195
You're jealous,
you know you couldn't do it.

15
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:04,354
10km? I could do it
standing on my head.

16
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:08,834
Come on then, enter the race, show
me what you've got, Paula Radcliffe.

17
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:10,835
Never say that to Paula Radcliffe.

18
00:01:11,955 --> 00:01:14,874
You said you could do it
standing on your head.

19
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:18,234
Definitely don't say that to
Paula Radcliffe.

20
00:01:18,235 --> 00:01:20,234
All right...

21
00:01:20,235 --> 00:01:22,114
Put me down.

22
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:25,474
Oh, why is there never a vet
around when you need one?

23
00:01:25,475 --> 00:01:27,874
You've got to train
for these things.

24
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:30,994
I know. In fact, I think I might pop
out now and do a quick three-miler.

25
00:01:30,995 --> 00:01:34,554
All right, well, take it easy,
especially on your first day.

26
00:01:34,555 --> 00:01:37,114
Thanks for the advice, but I
was doing half marathons

27
00:01:37,115 --> 00:01:39,274
when you were still
in your school uniform.

28
00:01:39,275 --> 00:01:41,995
Only you could say that
and make it sound like an alibi.

29
00:01:51,515 --> 00:01:54,474
Almost there.
Aghh! Not too fast.

30
00:01:54,475 --> 00:01:56,514
This is like doing
the three-legged-race

31
00:01:56,515 --> 00:01:58,674
with my less-developed Siamese twin.

32
00:01:58,675 --> 00:02:01,154
Thanks for picking me up.
That's all right.

33
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:02,994
How far did you run exactly?

34
00:02:02,995 --> 00:02:04,674
Just less than three.

35
00:02:04,675 --> 00:02:06,114
Miles or kilometres?

36
00:02:06,115 --> 00:02:07,634
Minutes.

37
00:02:07,635 --> 00:02:09,914
Well, I wasn't
expecting to pull something.

38
00:02:09,915 --> 00:02:12,954
Please don't say that
when you've got your arm around me.

39
00:02:12,955 --> 00:02:14,795
Especially not dressed like that.

40
00:02:16,795 --> 00:02:18,434
Did you remember to stretch?

41
00:02:18,435 --> 00:02:20,514
I want to get faster, not longer.

44
00:02:28,555 --> 00:02:31,194
Yes, I am. Pint of lager, please.

45
00:02:31,195 --> 00:02:33,195
And a tomato juice for the wife.

46
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,994
Anyway, what's the point?
Lucy's right.

47
00:02:36,995 --> 00:02:39,074
I'm clearly not up to this.

48
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,715
Is that what this is all about, then,

49
00:02:40,716 --> 00:02:43,314
trying to prove yourself
to your beloved landlady?

50
00:02:43,315 --> 00:02:45,114
Yeah, Tim, that's right.

51
00:02:45,115 --> 00:02:47,554
I figured if I can run faster
than your sister

52
00:02:47,555 --> 00:02:50,154
she might let me have sex with her.

53
00:02:50,155 --> 00:02:52,235
That's how all northerners
get a mate, isn't it?

54
00:02:57,195 --> 00:02:59,994
You'll be fine,
all you need is a sports massage.

55
00:02:59,995 --> 00:03:01,354
I know someone good.

56
00:03:01,355 --> 00:03:03,555
They helped me out recently
with a squash injury.

57
00:03:03,556 --> 00:03:05,114
A squash injury? What happened?

58
00:03:05,115 --> 00:03:07,915
Did you injure yourself letting
the lid off the Um Bongo bottle?

59
00:03:09,995 --> 00:03:13,595
Um Bongo doesn't come in a bottle,
it's a fruit drink in a pouch.

60
00:03:15,355 --> 00:03:18,794
Do you think the Chuckle Brothers
argue like this?

61
00:03:18,795 --> 00:03:21,954
Trust me, this masseur's brilliant.
Give him a go.

62
00:03:21,955 --> 00:03:23,794
Him?

63
00:03:23,795 --> 00:03:25,714
You let a bloke massage you?

64
00:03:25,715 --> 00:03:28,194
Where was the injury?

65
00:03:28,195 --> 00:03:30,715
If you must know,
it was a groin injury.

66
00:03:31,715 --> 00:03:35,195
What, you mean way down deep
in the middle of the Congo?

67
00:03:37,035 --> 00:03:40,594
Sorry, I've got the Um Bongo
advert in my head now.

68
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,155
I'll book my own massage, thank you.

69
00:03:42,156 --> 00:03:44,155
Do me a favour,
don't tell Lucy I'm injured,

70
00:03:44,156 --> 00:03:46,234
I don't want her thinking
I'm dropping out.

71
00:03:46,235 --> 00:03:49,875
Dropping out? In those little shorts
I think it's unavoidable.

72
00:03:51,635 --> 00:03:54,074
Letting a bloke massage you.

73
00:03:54,075 --> 00:03:56,714
You're unbelievable.
I bet you insist on a woman

74
00:03:56,715 --> 00:03:58,995
when you get yourself waxed
as well, don't you?

75
00:04:18,315 --> 00:04:22,594
Oh, hello. How come
I didn't see you last night?

76
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,554
Oh, I just fancied going
straight to bed after my run.

77
00:04:25,555 --> 00:04:27,395
Oh, you ran quite far,
then, did you?

78
00:04:27,396 --> 00:04:30,474
Yeah, I almost ended
up at the hospital.

79
00:04:30,475 --> 00:04:32,434
That's quite far, actually.

80
00:04:32,435 --> 00:04:34,235
I'm very impressed.

81
00:04:38,715 --> 00:04:40,034
What you doing?

82
00:04:40,035 --> 00:04:41,835
Having my breakfast.

83
00:04:53,635 --> 00:04:55,714
Why aren't you sitting down?

84
00:04:55,715 --> 00:04:58,914
Seemed appropriate
having my breakfast high up.

85
00:04:58,915 --> 00:05:00,274
Why?

86
00:05:00,275 --> 00:05:01,635
It's Alpen.

87
00:05:04,795 --> 00:05:06,955
Ooops! Avalanche.

88
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,754
What time you back tonight?

89
00:05:10,755 --> 00:05:13,434
Not until late.
I'm going to run back. Why?

90
00:05:13,435 --> 00:05:15,714
I've got a woman coming round.

91
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:18,755
Oh, yeah? Has the chloroform
rubbed off already?

92
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,954
What woman?

93
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:25,954
Personal trainer. She's going to
take me to the next level.

94
00:05:25,955 --> 00:05:29,234
Blimey, listen to Usain Bolt.

95
00:05:29,235 --> 00:05:32,195
Well Usain Bolt, I say tomato.

96
00:05:34,235 --> 00:05:36,314
Well, aren't you going to
get the brush?

97
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:40,035
Yeah. Soon as I've finished
my breakfast.

98
00:05:48,475 --> 00:05:50,755
I might tell Weight Watchers
about this idea.

99
00:05:58,075 --> 00:06:00,035
Oh!

100
00:06:03,515 --> 00:06:07,274
Ow! Aghhh!
That really hurts, you know.

101
00:06:07,275 --> 00:06:09,034
What is it you English say?

102
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,994
"Without you having
any of the pain first,

103
00:06:11,995 --> 00:06:15,514
"then there is not going to be
any of the gain afterwards."

104
00:06:15,515 --> 00:06:18,554
I don't think we say it
quite as succinctly as that.

105
00:06:18,555 --> 00:06:20,714
Arghhh! You're making joke, right?

106
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:23,594
You are saying
I say this thing wrong way.

107
00:06:23,595 --> 00:06:27,874
It sound different when I say it
because it is too long, right?

108
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:31,194
Hmm. I understand. It is funny

109
00:06:31,195 --> 00:06:34,274
You do know a laugh would have
covered all that, don't you?

110
00:06:34,275 --> 00:06:36,034
Aghhh!

111
00:06:36,035 --> 00:06:38,034
Have you done a massage before?

112
00:06:38,035 --> 00:06:39,354
Of course.

113
00:06:39,355 --> 00:06:44,675
Back in Warsaw I am known as Claudia
Gentle She Goat Hoof Fingers.

114
00:06:46,555 --> 00:06:49,474
It translates better in Polish.

115
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:52,275
Argghh! I'll tell you
where the plans are hidden.

116
00:06:53,315 --> 00:06:56,154
OK, time for T-shirt off, I think.

117
00:06:56,155 --> 00:06:59,114
Why? Are you going fight me now?

118
00:06:59,115 --> 00:07:01,714
Off, please. It's only my
leg that's injured.

119
00:07:01,715 --> 00:07:02,994
Don't be shy.

120
00:07:02,995 --> 00:07:06,154
I am sure you have very nice body.
Thank you very much.

121
00:07:06,155 --> 00:07:08,635
I've got a very nice bathroom,
do you need to see that too?

122
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,714
What? You prefer to do it
in the bathroom?

123
00:07:11,715 --> 00:07:12,754
Do what?

124
00:07:12,755 --> 00:07:14,155
Happy ending.

125
00:07:18,075 --> 00:07:19,994
Are you going to read to me?

126
00:07:19,995 --> 00:07:22,234
If you like.

127
00:07:22,235 --> 00:07:24,874
You want to pretend to
be baby, right?

128
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:28,874
You want Mamma to read to you
and change your nappy?

129
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:32,395
Are you talking on one of those
Bluetooth thingies?

130
00:07:37,635 --> 00:07:39,034
Sorry...

131
00:07:39,035 --> 00:07:41,314
are you erm...

132
00:07:41,315 --> 00:07:43,434
prostitute?

133
00:07:43,435 --> 00:07:46,674
No. I am a professional nurse
working for NHS,

134
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,675
this is new service we provide.

135
00:07:50,515 --> 00:07:53,035
You see, now I do joke.

136
00:07:53,795 --> 00:07:55,794
Of course I am prostitute.

137
00:07:55,795 --> 00:07:58,034
The advert in the newsagent
window said massage.

138
00:07:58,035 --> 00:08:00,354
It says "exotic massage."

139
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:03,154
I thought it meant you were
Brazilian or something.

140
00:08:03,155 --> 00:08:05,035
I do HAVE Brazilian.

141
00:08:08,715 --> 00:08:10,274
You want to see?

142
00:08:10,275 --> 00:08:13,314
You just leave Juninho where he is,
thank you very much.

143
00:08:13,315 --> 00:08:16,194
I'm sorry, there's been
a bit of a crossed wire here,

144
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:17,754
could you just leave please?

145
00:08:17,755 --> 00:08:20,794
I don't leave until you pay me.

146
00:08:20,795 --> 00:08:21,995
£100.

147
00:08:23,315 --> 00:08:24,714
We didn't do anything.

148
00:08:24,715 --> 00:08:27,594
That's not my fault.
You pay me for one hour.

149
00:08:27,595 --> 00:08:30,234
An hour?
It wouldn't have taken me an hour.

150
00:08:30,235 --> 00:08:32,154
How long would it have taken you?

151
00:08:32,155 --> 00:08:34,955
I'll cover the cost
of your travel card.

152
00:08:36,195 --> 00:08:40,314
Pay me or I send round man.

153
00:08:40,315 --> 00:08:43,794
He has special way of dealing
with people like you.

154
00:08:43,795 --> 00:08:46,554
He will break every
bone in your body.

155
00:08:46,555 --> 00:08:48,595
I'm surprised you need him.

156
00:08:53,235 --> 00:08:57,755
If you are hooker as well,
make sure he pays you first.

157
00:09:01,795 --> 00:09:04,075
Nice day at the office?

158
00:09:07,795 --> 00:09:09,035
I don't know what's worse.

159
00:09:09,036 --> 00:09:11,154
You using the services of
women like that here,

160
00:09:11,155 --> 00:09:13,154
or the fact that she
thought I was one too.

161
00:09:13,155 --> 00:09:15,634
What kind of hooker
dresses like this?

162
00:09:15,635 --> 00:09:17,034
Sebastian Ho?

163
00:09:17,035 --> 00:09:20,554
Lucy, do I look like the type
of person who pays for sex?

164
00:09:20,555 --> 00:09:24,315
Not usually, no. It would be
a bit odd paying yourself.

165
00:09:25,675 --> 00:09:28,274
I thought she was a genuine
sports massage person.

166
00:09:28,275 --> 00:09:30,675
Is that right?
And why would you need one of those?

167
00:09:30,676 --> 00:09:32,194
I got injured yesterday running.

168
00:09:32,195 --> 00:09:36,154
Lucy, think what you like about me,
but I've never lied to you.

169
00:09:36,155 --> 00:09:38,035
I thought you said
the run went well.

170
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,554
I lied.

171
00:09:39,555 --> 00:09:42,314
I didn't want you thinking
I was some sort of failure.

172
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:44,994
Oh, well, nothing screams success
more than being caught

173
00:09:44,995 --> 00:09:46,835
in your pants with
a six-foot hooker.

174
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,833
I thought you were going
to be back late.

175
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:50,035
I forgot my stopwatch.

176
00:09:50,036 --> 00:09:54,075
Unlike you, I was planning more than
30 seconds of active exercise today.

177
00:09:57,315 --> 00:09:59,034
Oh, will you stop doing that,

178
00:09:59,035 --> 00:10:01,234
following me round pretending
you're injured?

179
00:10:01,235 --> 00:10:03,395
You're like an appeal
for abused whippets.

180
00:10:05,275 --> 00:10:08,074
Right, if you don't believe me,
I'll phone that Claudia woman now

181
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:12,114
and she can prove I'm telling
the truth. Where's that number?

182
00:10:12,115 --> 00:10:15,235
You're such a liar.
It was in my top pocket.

183
00:10:16,235 --> 00:10:18,954
Look, Lucy, I promise,
nothing happened between us.

184
00:10:18,955 --> 00:10:22,674
Blimey, rejected by a hooker.
That's a new low, even for you.

185
00:10:22,675 --> 00:10:24,674
I wasn't rejected,
I declined her services.

186
00:10:24,675 --> 00:10:25,715
Why did you pay her?

187
00:10:25,716 --> 00:10:28,314
Because she rubbed
oil at the top of my legs.

188
00:10:28,315 --> 00:10:30,435
Just the tree trunks,
not the acorns.

189
00:10:31,835 --> 00:10:34,194
And that costs £100, does it?

190
00:10:34,195 --> 00:10:36,994
No, the £100 was to stop
the pimp beating me up.

191
00:10:36,995 --> 00:10:38,913
You've met
the pimp as well, have you?

192
00:10:38,914 --> 00:10:40,875
No, I haven't met the pimp!
And I don't want to.

193
00:10:40,876 --> 00:10:43,794
The best way to not meet him is to
always pay to the prostitute.

194
00:10:43,795 --> 00:10:46,635
Now you're just quoting the motto
from your family's coat of arms.

195
00:10:54,635 --> 00:10:57,794
A lady of the night? Blimey.

196
00:10:57,795 --> 00:11:00,994
Well, I suppose it is the oldest
profession in the world.

197
00:11:00,995 --> 00:11:03,034
I've never really understood
how that worked.

198
00:11:03,035 --> 00:11:04,313
How do you mean?

199
00:11:04,314 --> 00:11:06,275
If it's the oldest
profession in the world,

200
00:11:06,276 --> 00:11:08,914
at some point it must have been
the first and only profession.

201
00:11:08,915 --> 00:11:10,234
So?

202
00:11:10,235 --> 00:11:14,074
So where was everyone else
getting the money to pay for it?

203
00:11:14,075 --> 00:11:15,955
Look, Tim, I need you
to do me a favour.

204
00:11:15,956 --> 00:11:18,074
Can you go round to the flat
and tell Lucy that

205
00:11:18,075 --> 00:11:21,194
I got injured running yesterday and
that you suggested a sports massage?

206
00:11:21,195 --> 00:11:23,754
Are you sure you're giving me
the whole picture here?

207
00:11:23,755 --> 00:11:25,634
What's that supposed to mean?

208
00:11:25,635 --> 00:11:29,474
You were very adamant about not have
a man massaging you, weren't you?

209
00:11:29,475 --> 00:11:32,634
Why do you choose a woman to
do your cleaning?

210
00:11:32,635 --> 00:11:35,754
Because I don't want some strange
bloke walking round my flat.

211
00:11:35,755 --> 00:11:37,155
I prefer a woman doing it.

212
00:11:37,156 --> 00:11:40,274
So that means you want to have
sex with her, right? Of course not.

213
00:11:40,275 --> 00:11:42,274
Apart from the obvious moral
argument,

214
00:11:42,275 --> 00:11:45,035
at £9.50 an hour, I want
her fully focused on the dusting.

215
00:11:46,275 --> 00:11:48,314
Exactly. And at £100 an hour

216
00:11:48,315 --> 00:11:51,514
I wanted her focused on
my quadricep femoris.

217
00:11:51,515 --> 00:11:53,074
You are disgusting.

218
00:11:53,075 --> 00:11:54,754
It's a muscle.

219
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,835
I don't care what it's classed as.

220
00:11:58,475 --> 00:12:00,914
Right, that's it. Come on
Where are we going?

221
00:12:00,915 --> 00:12:03,313
We're going to the newsagents
to find that phone number

222
00:12:03,314 --> 00:12:05,275
and you can phone that
bloody woman yourself.

223
00:12:05,276 --> 00:12:07,434
She'll confirm to you I'm
telling the truth.

224
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,114
Right. I will.

225
00:12:09,115 --> 00:12:12,474
I always think truth is a bit
like an expensive cashmere jumper.

226
00:12:12,475 --> 00:12:14,514
Ruined when stretched.

227
00:12:14,515 --> 00:12:17,474
I always think the truth is a like
an expensive roll of toilet paper.

228
00:12:17,475 --> 00:12:19,835
Wasted on arseholes.

229
00:12:29,155 --> 00:12:30,715
Where's it gone?

230
00:12:32,555 --> 00:12:35,954
I'm telling you, it was just there.
Well, it's not there any more, is it?

231
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:38,275
Unless she's changed her name to
Puppies for Sale.

232
00:12:38,276 --> 00:12:40,714
She may as well have.

233
00:12:40,715 --> 00:12:42,994
I'm going to ask inside

234
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:46,395
Of course you are. Why let a little
thing like dignity get in the way?

235
00:12:47,635 --> 00:12:49,555
Hello.

236
00:12:50,635 --> 00:12:52,435
Yes?

237
00:12:53,435 --> 00:12:57,715
There was a card in the window
earlier but now it's gone.

238
00:12:59,115 --> 00:13:02,034
"School children only allowed
when accompanied by an adult?"

239
00:13:02,035 --> 00:13:03,635
I've got ID.

240
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:07,554
That's the card I took down.

241
00:13:07,555 --> 00:13:11,234
What about the... other one?

242
00:13:11,235 --> 00:13:12,874
You know, the...

243
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,274
the lady...

244
00:13:15,275 --> 00:13:17,234
who does the massage.

245
00:13:17,235 --> 00:13:19,914
Oh, that. I removed it.

246
00:13:19,915 --> 00:13:22,154
I felt it was inappropriate.

247
00:13:22,155 --> 00:13:23,515
I agree.

248
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,914
Shouldn't be allowed.
I blame the men who ring.

249
00:13:26,915 --> 00:13:29,514
If it wasn't for them,
these women wouldn't be exploited.

250
00:13:29,515 --> 00:13:30,834
It's disgusting.

251
00:13:30,835 --> 00:13:32,555
Are you looking for
the phone number?

252
00:13:32,556 --> 00:13:33,954
Yes.

253
00:13:33,955 --> 00:13:35,674
Well, I've thrown it away.

254
00:13:35,675 --> 00:13:37,554
Oh.

255
00:13:37,555 --> 00:13:38,875
Is that all you came in for?

256
00:13:38,876 --> 00:13:39,955
No.

257
00:13:41,395 --> 00:13:43,075
Two Curly Wurlys, please.

258
00:13:45,275 --> 00:13:47,195
And one for yourself.

259
00:13:51,315 --> 00:13:54,114
Try Hanover Street.

260
00:13:54,115 --> 00:13:57,234
I believe that's where these
women like to tout for these

261
00:13:57,235 --> 00:13:59,394
desperate, sad individuals.

262
00:13:59,395 --> 00:14:01,714
I hope that's not aimed at me.

263
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:05,555
I'll have you know I'm a valued and
respected member of the community.

264
00:14:07,595 --> 00:14:10,355
Which way's Hanover Street?

265
00:14:23,075 --> 00:14:24,315
I can't see her.

266
00:14:24,316 --> 00:14:27,074
Maybe we should ask one of the other
women if they know her.

267
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:30,354
This is ridiculous
You're damn right it's ridiculous.

268
00:14:30,355 --> 00:14:33,714
All you have to say is, "Of course
I'll verify your story to Lucy,

269
00:14:33,715 --> 00:14:35,435
"you're not the type
of person to lie,

270
00:14:35,436 --> 00:14:37,474
"because you're an
honourable human being

271
00:14:37,475 --> 00:14:39,315
"who has some moral fibre
and decency."

272
00:14:40,475 --> 00:14:42,195
Let's ask that one

273
00:14:50,395 --> 00:14:53,554
Hi, darling.
Looking for some company?

274
00:14:53,555 --> 00:14:57,194
Actually, I've already got company.

275
00:14:57,195 --> 00:14:59,234
I see.

276
00:14:59,235 --> 00:15:01,394
I don't usually do
that sort of thing,

277
00:15:01,395 --> 00:15:03,875
but I'm sure we can come to some
sort of an arrangement.

278
00:15:03,876 --> 00:15:05,634
Oh, goodness.

279
00:15:05,635 --> 00:15:08,154
We don't want any of that
sort of thing, thank you very much.

280
00:15:08,155 --> 00:15:10,234
Certainly not with him
in the same room.

281
00:15:10,235 --> 00:15:12,795
I can just about tolerate having
him round for Sunday roast.

282
00:15:14,515 --> 00:15:16,354
What?

283
00:15:16,355 --> 00:15:21,394
One day, when you're a big boy,
I will explain why that was funny.

284
00:15:21,395 --> 00:15:23,314
Look, what do you want?

285
00:15:23,315 --> 00:15:25,475
Do you know where
I can find a woman called Claudia?

286
00:15:25,476 --> 00:15:27,754
Sounds like Dracula
but without the charm.

287
00:15:27,755 --> 00:15:29,554
Depends who's asking.

288
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:31,834
You could be the filth
for all I know.

289
00:15:31,835 --> 00:15:35,514
And I ain't no grass, so if you
are rozzers, you can sling it.

290
00:15:35,515 --> 00:15:37,874
Fascinating! What?

291
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,394
I haven't heard language like that

292
00:15:39,395 --> 00:15:42,034
since my youth club
production of My Fair Lady.

293
00:15:42,035 --> 00:15:44,714
Do you think you could help us
out before the Professor here

294
00:15:44,715 --> 00:15:47,195
tries to kidnap you
and work on your vowel sounds?

295
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,074
I know where she is.

296
00:15:49,075 --> 00:15:50,874
But it'll cost ya.

297
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,754
How much?

298
00:15:52,755 --> 00:15:55,034
80.

299
00:15:55,035 --> 00:15:58,274
£80 for directions?
My TomTom cost less than that.

300
00:15:58,275 --> 00:16:01,434
And I bet you won't tell us in the
voice of SpongeBob Square Pants.

301
00:16:01,435 --> 00:16:03,795
I could, but that'll cost ya more.

302
00:16:04,835 --> 00:16:06,234
OK, fine.

303
00:16:06,235 --> 00:16:08,715
Can you lend me £80?

304
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,515
This is going on the bill.

305
00:16:11,516 --> 00:16:13,794
You now owe me £80

306
00:16:13,795 --> 00:16:16,674
plus 20 years of
self respect and happiness.

307
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:19,355
All right, call it 85.

308
00:16:22,275 --> 00:16:26,315
She works from a house at the top
end of Jutland Street.

309
00:16:32,675 --> 00:16:34,915
Please tell me
that's an ice-cream van.

310
00:16:47,355 --> 00:16:49,314
Is this ever going to end?

311
00:16:49,315 --> 00:16:50,794
They'll let us go soon.

312
00:16:50,795 --> 00:16:53,394
I meant our friendship.

313
00:16:53,395 --> 00:16:55,234
My life's over.

314
00:16:55,235 --> 00:16:58,034
Your life's over?
What about when Lucy finds out?

315
00:16:58,035 --> 00:17:00,034
All this just
because of a stupid race.

316
00:17:00,035 --> 00:17:03,434
You're doing better than the other
race you're involved in. What race?

317
00:17:03,435 --> 00:17:05,155
The human race.

318
00:17:06,435 --> 00:17:08,394
Oh, hello, officer.

319
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:10,035
Sit down.

320
00:17:12,075 --> 00:17:14,634
Look, there's been a huge mistake.
We're not kerb crawlers.

321
00:17:14,635 --> 00:17:17,033
We've never been in trouble
with the law in our lives.

322
00:17:17,034 --> 00:17:18,395
Isn't that right, Timothy?

323
00:17:18,396 --> 00:17:22,035
I was once ticked off for scrumping
apples, would that be on record?

324
00:17:23,155 --> 00:17:26,115
Of course not. That was months ago.

325
00:17:27,155 --> 00:17:29,314
Look, we weren't looking
for a prostitute.

326
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:30,514
Is that right?

327
00:17:30,515 --> 00:17:34,434
Well, not that one anyway.
And which one were you looking for?

328
00:17:34,435 --> 00:17:36,475
The one that
I had in my flat earlier.

329
00:17:37,995 --> 00:17:40,194
So you had one in
your flat, did you?

330
00:17:40,195 --> 00:17:41,995
Yeah, I didn't know
she was a prostitute.

331
00:17:41,996 --> 00:17:43,714
Did any money change hands?

332
00:17:43,715 --> 00:17:45,594
No.

333
00:17:45,595 --> 00:17:47,674
Well, yes, but not
for anything untoward.

334
00:17:47,675 --> 00:17:50,274
It was all above board.
So why did you pay her?

335
00:17:50,275 --> 00:17:52,634
So her pimp wouldn't beat me up.

336
00:17:52,635 --> 00:17:54,435
I want a different lawyer.

337
00:17:55,635 --> 00:17:58,874
I'm sure if we can just find this
woman, she'll verify our story.

338
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,474
It's a pity you didn't find her
then, isn't it?

339
00:18:01,475 --> 00:18:04,475
But there's another lady
here to see you.

340
00:18:06,435 --> 00:18:08,995
Oh, thank God.
It's Inspector Clouseau.

341
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:11,914
Hello, sweetheart.

342
00:18:11,915 --> 00:18:15,114
I got a call from
the police station.

343
00:18:15,115 --> 00:18:17,194
It's not what it looks like.

344
00:18:17,195 --> 00:18:19,555
I know, it looks like a library.

345
00:18:21,395 --> 00:18:22,875
You didn't tell Lucy, did you?

346
00:18:22,876 --> 00:18:25,275
Of course not.
Why on earth would I tell Lucy?

347
00:18:27,675 --> 00:18:30,674
Oh, that Lucy. Yeah, I told her.

348
00:18:30,675 --> 00:18:33,115
I thought you meant my cousin's cat.

349
00:18:34,795 --> 00:18:37,233
Don't tell me, there's been
another misunderstanding.

350
00:18:37,234 --> 00:18:39,515
You didn't know this one was
a prostitute either,

351
00:18:39,516 --> 00:18:42,794
you just thought she was an overly
friendly lollipop lady.

352
00:18:42,795 --> 00:18:44,115
Look, I know you're cross

353
00:18:44,116 --> 00:18:46,675
Oh, this is no time for jokes, Lee.

354
00:18:48,835 --> 00:18:52,155
Oh, was that not a joke?
Lollipop lady... cross?

355
00:18:54,755 --> 00:18:56,874
Look, can I just explain?

356
00:18:56,875 --> 00:19:00,274
Forget it. I've come to tell you not
to bother coming back to the flat.

357
00:19:00,275 --> 00:19:02,714
Actually, I think he's telling
the truth, Lucy.

358
00:19:02,715 --> 00:19:04,475
Well, you would say that,
wouldn't you?

359
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,434
You think you know your own brother,
walking round all posh

360
00:19:07,435 --> 00:19:09,994
and innocent like some
sort of Hugh Grant figure.

361
00:19:09,995 --> 00:19:11,794
Turns out you're just a...

362
00:19:11,795 --> 00:19:13,635
Well, a Hugh Grant figure.

363
00:19:14,955 --> 00:19:17,914
Come on, Daisy, we're leaving.
You can help me pack Lee's things.

364
00:19:17,915 --> 00:19:20,955
Where would I find a suit case?
I meant at the flat.

365
00:19:28,395 --> 00:19:30,594
Oh, well, at least
they've let us go.

366
00:19:30,595 --> 00:19:33,554
You heard the sergeant.
It still might be going to court.

367
00:19:33,555 --> 00:19:35,594
People like me can't go to prison.

368
00:19:35,595 --> 00:19:37,714
Don't worry, they'll treat
you like a king.

369
00:19:37,715 --> 00:19:39,514
Well... a queen.

370
00:19:39,515 --> 00:19:43,474
Look, stop panicking.
We are not going to prison

371
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:45,394
and I'm not getting evicted.

372
00:19:45,395 --> 00:19:47,115
That woman told us where Claudia is

373
00:19:47,116 --> 00:19:49,794
and we are going straight round
there now and telling her

374
00:19:49,795 --> 00:19:52,194
she has to back up our
story to the police.

375
00:19:52,195 --> 00:19:54,194
Oh, thank Goodness.
I thought I was going home

376
00:19:54,195 --> 00:19:57,435
for a nice cup of tea and
a custard cream. To the brothel!

377
00:20:13,355 --> 00:20:15,154
You know the last foyer I was in?

378
00:20:15,155 --> 00:20:16,714
The Dorchester.

379
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,754
And you know who
I saw sitting in there?

380
00:20:19,755 --> 00:20:22,115
Gloria Hunniford and Patricia Hodge.

381
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,715
This is what being
your friend's all about.

382
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:30,635
Is he the madam?

383
00:20:32,155 --> 00:20:33,635
Let me do the talking.

384
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:38,435
Evening Madam... Sir.

385
00:20:39,435 --> 00:20:41,354
We're looking for a woman.

386
00:20:41,355 --> 00:20:43,035
Which one's it going to be?

387
00:20:45,635 --> 00:20:48,794
Blimey, Cilla, I preferred
the original show.

388
00:20:48,795 --> 00:20:51,674
Will it be number one, who says
she likes her men to be tall,

389
00:20:51,675 --> 00:20:53,915
dark and pay cash up front?

390
00:20:55,675 --> 00:20:58,434
I believe you've got a
Claudia working here.

391
00:20:58,435 --> 00:20:59,915
And who are you exactly?

392
00:21:00,915 --> 00:21:03,754
Actually... I'm one of her clients.

393
00:21:03,755 --> 00:21:05,154
I don't remember you.

394
00:21:05,155 --> 00:21:08,234
Well, I usually wear glasses,

395
00:21:08,235 --> 00:21:09,955
do you remember me now?

396
00:21:11,195 --> 00:21:15,034
Yeah he's the bloke who's always
in the tree opposite the building.

397
00:21:15,035 --> 00:21:17,514
Can we see her or not?

398
00:21:17,515 --> 00:21:19,275
Yeah, come on, don't bust our asses.

399
00:21:19,276 --> 00:21:23,874
You're looking at two cats wanting
to get jiggy with some hoes.

400
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,875
Hammer time.

401
00:21:27,755 --> 00:21:30,714
Look, Tim, why don't you leave me
to talk to the gentleman.

402
00:21:30,715 --> 00:21:34,035
You go and talk to the nice ladies,
discuss make-up tips.

403
00:21:35,355 --> 00:21:38,554
Oh, actually, I'm going
to need some money.

404
00:21:38,555 --> 00:21:41,994
I'll tell you what, this whole
not actually using prostitutes thing

405
00:21:41,995 --> 00:21:43,915
is turning out pretty expensive.

406
00:21:45,435 --> 00:21:48,595
Actually, I don't suppose I could use
my Nectar... Of course not

407
00:21:50,755 --> 00:21:55,474
The thing is,
it's my friend's birthday today

408
00:21:55,475 --> 00:21:59,594
and I wanted to get him something
special, I usually get him a tie.

409
00:21:59,595 --> 00:22:01,835
Claudia's not a Thai, she's Polish.

410
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:06,034
I meant something to
wrap around his neck.

411
00:22:06,035 --> 00:22:09,634
Actually Claudia sounds perfect,
second door on the left.

412
00:22:09,635 --> 00:22:12,154
And it's not just stationary
that's tax deductible,

413
00:22:12,155 --> 00:22:14,634
you should be keeping
receipts for everything.

414
00:22:14,635 --> 00:22:18,035
Make-up, lingerie... prophylactics.

415
00:22:19,795 --> 00:22:22,034
Careful, ladies.
The first five minutes is free

416
00:22:22,035 --> 00:22:25,395
but then he starts
charging his hourly rate.

417
00:22:27,715 --> 00:22:29,275
Yes?

418
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:33,475
Oh, hello.

419
00:22:34,475 --> 00:22:36,314
What is matter now?

420
00:22:36,315 --> 00:22:39,075
Something other than your leg
stiff this time?

421
00:22:41,275 --> 00:22:42,755
This is my friend Tim.

422
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:46,834
We, er, need to ask you a favour.

423
00:22:46,835 --> 00:22:48,634
It's his first time, right?

424
00:22:48,635 --> 00:22:50,074
No, of course it's not!

425
00:22:50,075 --> 00:22:52,835
Blimey, I'm 43, not 29 again.

426
00:22:56,835 --> 00:23:01,114
He doesn't want your...
services. Neither of us do.

427
00:23:01,115 --> 00:23:03,594
This room is for customers only.

428
00:23:03,595 --> 00:23:06,474
If Ronnie catches you just
talking to me,

429
00:23:06,475 --> 00:23:09,755
he will come in here with
baseball bat and break your legs.

430
00:23:15,315 --> 00:23:17,834
OK. How you want to do this?

431
00:23:17,835 --> 00:23:21,194
Separately or both at the same time?

432
00:23:21,195 --> 00:23:24,675
Good grief. Is it too late to take
the baseball bat?

433
00:23:25,915 --> 00:23:27,635
Why did we have to
take our clothes off?

434
00:23:27,636 --> 00:23:30,354
You heard the lady, Tim,
this room's for clients only.

435
00:23:30,355 --> 00:23:33,754
So? People can still have intimacy
with their clothes on.

436
00:23:33,755 --> 00:23:35,274
Have you heard of cuddling?

437
00:23:35,275 --> 00:23:37,594
A cuddling threesome?

438
00:23:37,595 --> 00:23:40,634
This is a brothel, Tim,
not an anger management workshop.

439
00:23:40,635 --> 00:23:45,674
This may not be your first time, but
it is first time with hooker, right?

440
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:47,994
Believe it not, second time today.

441
00:23:47,995 --> 00:23:51,194
And if you think that's a shock to
you, imagine how it sounds to me.

442
00:23:51,195 --> 00:23:53,074
When I woke up this morning,

443
00:23:53,075 --> 00:23:56,515
my only plans were to buy some
waterproof bicycle panniers.

444
00:23:57,555 --> 00:23:59,234
What is panniers?

445
00:23:59,235 --> 00:24:03,354
A storage system to aid commuting,
which attaches to the main frame.

446
00:24:03,355 --> 00:24:06,554
It derives from the old French word
meaning bread basket.

447
00:24:06,555 --> 00:24:07,795
I want to go home.

448
00:24:09,275 --> 00:24:11,355
OK. What is going on here?

449
00:24:13,635 --> 00:24:16,914
Like I say, Claudia,
we don't want... intercourse.

450
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:20,114
Well, thank goodness one of us
can talk the talk.

451
00:24:20,115 --> 00:24:22,073
We need you to ask you a big favour.

452
00:24:22,074 --> 00:24:24,035
I got in to a bit of trouble
with the police,

453
00:24:24,036 --> 00:24:25,874
and more importantly, my landlady.

454
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:28,193
Can you come down to the police
station and tell them

455
00:24:28,194 --> 00:24:29,995
everything that happened
this morning?

456
00:24:29,996 --> 00:24:32,394
You want me to come with you
to police station?

457
00:24:32,395 --> 00:24:33,875
Yes.

458
00:24:35,275 --> 00:24:37,194
OK. We do it.

459
00:24:37,195 --> 00:24:38,874
Really?

460
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:41,154
No. It is joke.

461
00:24:41,155 --> 00:24:43,394
Do you think I am crazy?

462
00:24:43,395 --> 00:24:45,194
If I go to police they arrest me.

463
00:24:45,195 --> 00:24:47,034
And my pimp will kill you both.

464
00:24:47,035 --> 00:24:49,034
Now get out now!

465
00:24:49,035 --> 00:24:51,154
OK, no more Mr Nice Guy.

466
00:24:51,155 --> 00:24:53,994
Either you come to the station
with us, or we tell the police

467
00:24:53,995 --> 00:24:56,634
exactly where you are and what
you're doing to earn a living.

468
00:24:56,635 --> 00:24:59,554
Yeah... that shut you up, hasn't it?

469
00:24:59,555 --> 00:25:01,835
Ronnieeeeeeeeeeeeee!

470
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:06,314
Think about it, the police can't
arrest you for telling the truth.

471
00:25:06,315 --> 00:25:09,274
It's not illegal to do proper
massages and that's all you did.

472
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:11,154
We'll pay you for your time.

473
00:25:11,155 --> 00:25:13,674
And Ronnie doesn't need to know.

474
00:25:13,675 --> 00:25:17,274
We can keep him in the dark.
Maybe not.

475
00:25:17,275 --> 00:25:18,515
I was distinctly told

476
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:22,034
if I took my clothes off I wouldn't
get hit with a baseball bat.

477
00:25:22,035 --> 00:25:23,634
I want to see the manager.

478
00:25:23,635 --> 00:25:25,435
What's going on?

479
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,714
Everything is all right.

480
00:25:30,715 --> 00:25:33,154
I thought these two men
were not going to pay

481
00:25:33,155 --> 00:25:36,355
but we have reached
an amicable settlement.

482
00:25:37,915 --> 00:25:40,274
OK, birthday boy,
I think your time's up.

483
00:25:40,275 --> 00:25:42,514
Yeah, come on, Tim, let's be
getting you back.

484
00:25:42,515 --> 00:25:45,114
Those parcels aren't going to
pass themselves.

485
00:25:45,115 --> 00:25:46,954
Where are we going?

486
00:25:46,955 --> 00:25:50,435
We're going to see your sister
with our heads held high.

487
00:26:14,475 --> 00:26:17,834
Are you sure you're OK? Fine.

488
00:26:17,835 --> 00:26:21,394
Just saving some energy
for the other 9.5K.

489
00:26:21,395 --> 00:26:24,234
It was good of Claudia to tell
the police everything,

490
00:26:24,235 --> 00:26:26,234
but how did you get her to
agree to talk to me?

491
00:26:26,235 --> 00:26:28,234
I can be very persuasive
when I want to be.

492
00:26:28,235 --> 00:26:30,994
You persuaded her it was
the right thing to do?

493
00:26:30,995 --> 00:26:33,315
No, I persuaded Tim to pay
her more money.

494
00:26:34,355 --> 00:26:36,794
How's the leg?

495
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:39,835
Bearing up.
I never did have that massage.

496
00:26:41,155 --> 00:26:44,194
What do you reckon? I've got cash.

497
00:26:44,195 --> 00:26:46,674
Well, Tim has.

498
00:26:46,675 --> 00:26:48,994
You couldn't afford me, sweetheart.

499
00:26:48,995 --> 00:26:50,434
That's true.

500
00:26:50,435 --> 00:26:52,234
If you were a call girl,

501
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,594
you'd definitely be the top end
discreet stuff.

502
00:26:54,595 --> 00:26:57,154
You know, just really rich
Japanese businessmen...

503
00:26:57,155 --> 00:26:59,474
Stop talking! Right.

504
00:26:59,475 --> 00:27:01,794
Thanks for taking me back.

505
00:27:01,795 --> 00:27:05,314
That's all right.
All's well that ends well.

506
00:27:05,315 --> 00:27:07,874
Yeah, I'm tempted to say it's
a happy ending,

507
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:11,034
but now I know what it means...

508
00:27:11,035 --> 00:27:13,754
I hope you've learned
something from all this.

509
00:27:13,755 --> 00:27:17,154
Course I have, try not to get
injured when you do running.

510
00:27:17,155 --> 00:27:20,715
And when it comes to women, always
keep away from very large Poles.

511
00:27:24,235 --> 00:27:42,990
