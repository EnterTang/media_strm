1
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,660
谁管啊
Who cares?

2
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,120

The whole point is,

3
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,990

she never was in the first place, Billy.

4
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,660
你明白吗
Do you understand?

5
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:52,340
- 是的  - 抱歉 你说什么 大声点
- Yeah. - I'm sorry, what? A little louder?

6
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,710
是的
Yeah.

7
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,550
你说得对 不敢相信我竟然这么入戏
You were right. I can't believe I got so caught up.

8
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,310
我就是这个意思
That's what  I'm talking about.

9
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:11,060
You know what I mean?  That's it.

10
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:20,160
这个公园蛊惑人心
This park seduces everyone.

11
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,620
你只是比大部分人
You were just a little more...

12
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:27,710
更投入而已
enthusiastic than most.

13
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:30,120
你想当英雄
You wanted to be the hero.

14
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:31,710
我理解
I get it.

15
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,420
还有
And, hey,

16
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,550
在这儿发生的事
what happens here

17
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,760
就让它留在这儿吧
stays here.

18
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:49,810

This has been some real bonding shit.

19
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:52,100
我们即将成为兄弟了
We're gonna be brothers, Billy.

20
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,110
我很高兴
I'm glad.

21
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,110
真心高兴
Really, I am.

22
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,170
- 干杯  - 干杯
- Cheers! - Yeah.

23
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,970
- 威士忌让人们同桌共饮  - 好诶
- Whiskey brings us together. - Whoo-hoo!

24
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,020
西奥多
Theodore.

25
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,820
欢迎回来
Welcome back.

26
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,160
你终于把咱带到地儿了 泰迪
You really landed us in it this time, Teddy.

27
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,330
你追踪到了那个婊子
You tracked down the very whore

28
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,840
让她带咱们去见迷宫的守门人
that can lead us  to the gatekeeper  of the maze.

29
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,720
然后你的记忆故障又坏了好事
Then your little  memory glitch fucked us.

30
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,060
嘘
Shh.

31
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,570
你和他们是同伙吗
You're one of them?

32
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,120
你干了什么
What have you done?

33
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,080
怀亚特在哪儿
Where's Wyatt?

34
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,740
怀亚特还没回来
Wyatt has yet to return.

35
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,830
你会在最后见他的地方找到他
You'll find him where you saw him last.

36
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,170
埃斯卡兰特
Escalante.

37
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,720
怀亚特在演习中失踪了
Wyatt went missing while out on maneuvers.

38
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,220
回来的时候
Came back with some...

39
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,890
满脑子奇怪想法
strange ideas.

40
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,850
他告诉我他需要我
He told me he needed me.

41
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,060
我不能反抗
I couldn't resist.

42
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:06,610
就像是恶魔本人控制了我
It was like the devil himself had taken control of me.

43
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,250
我们就叛变了
We mutinied.

44
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,880
我们杀光了所以士兵
We killed every soldier.

45
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,470
之后怀亚特杀了将军
And then Wyatt killed the general.

46
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,600
然后他准备杀掉我
Then he turned on me.

47
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,440
你确定事实是这样的
Are you sure that's how it was?

48
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,280
看着我 西奥多
Look at me, Theodore.

49
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,440
你记得吗
Don't you remember?

50
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,800
不 不要 求求你 不要
No! No, please, no!

51
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,970
不 不要 求你
No, no, no, please.

52
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:10,590
求你 不要
Please, no! Please.

53
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:15,810
不 不要 求你
No, no, please.

54
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:18,020
不 泰迪 求你 不要啊
No, Teddy. Please, please, no!

55
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,150
不
No.

56
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,820

No, no, I couldn't have.

57
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,530
You did.

58
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,240
And you will again.

59
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,660
这次我们会和你并肩作战
This time, we'll be fighting with you.

60
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,910
等怀亚特回来 你将会在他身边
When Wyatt returns, you'll be by his side

61
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,660
行走于沙海吞没之城
in the city swallowed by sand.

62
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,290
但你还没准备好
But you're not ready.

63
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,830
还没有
Not yet.

64
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,800
也许在下一世
Maybe in the next life.

65
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,980
沙海吞没之城
"City swallowed by sand."

66
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,190
我到过那儿
I've been there.

67
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,410

The maze is taking me  full circle.

68
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,870
The maze isn't meant for you.

69
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,170
But if you like games so much...

70
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:28,630
why don't you try one of ours?

71
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:16,050
Whoa, boy.

72
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,930
Whoa, boy.

73
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:23,060
Okay, now.

74
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,940
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

75
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,190
Whoa, now.

76
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,610
Okay, boy.

77
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:45,080
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

78
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,420
Shh.

79
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,800
Good boy.

80
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,940
Ah!

81
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:21,160
Have you ever considered golf?

82
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,450
Might be easier on your back.

83
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:29,130
I don't like interruptions, Charlotte.

84
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,960
You know that.

85
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,550
I don't like hiking through the park in civvies,

86
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,630
but there's a delicate matter to discuss.

87
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,890
Theresa Cullen has died.

88
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:42,510
Slipped down a crevasse attempting to secure our information.

89
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,100
Ruled an accident.

90
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:48,690
There are no accidents, not in here.

91
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:51,820
With all due respect, not everything is a part of this game.

92
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,480
Then you don't see the whole game.

93
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,900
Or perhaps you can no longer see beyond it.

94
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:02,280
Ford's stories are engaging.

95
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:05,040
For some, downright addictive.

96
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,750
But for all of Ford's obsessing with the hosts' verbal tics

97
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,170
and convoluted backstories,

98
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:11,170
most of the guests just want a warm body

99
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:13,130
to shoot or to fuck.

100
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:14,420
They would be perfectly happy

101
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:16,550
with something a little less baroque.

102
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:19,340
- And so would the board. - That's why you're here.

103
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,100
You want my vote to push Ford out.

104
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,310
I like for these things to be unanimous.

105
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:29,060
After all, it was you who kept Ford in business all those years ago.

106
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,650
The narratives I'm interested in aren't Ford's.

107
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:35,530
You want to push him out, be my guest.

108
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:37,190
But no more interruptions.

109
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,450
I know where I'm going now.

110
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:39,740
I don't want to be disturbed.

111
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,740
Good luck, Charlotte.

112
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,720
What's the problem?

113
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,390
A signal from a system-tethered device.

114
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:07,100
It belongs to a behavior tech on leave.

115
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:13,310
There hasn't been employee activity

116
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,980
in that sector for weeks.

117
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,530
I'm guessing it's a glitch.

118
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:17,980
All right.

119
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,610
I'm heading out to take a look.

120
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,280
And keep monitoring till I check in.

121
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:52,440
I'm at the location where we got that signal.

122
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,310
Any sign of it?

123
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,230
Control Room, do you copy?

124
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,290
Heya, fellas.

125
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,960
At ease.

126
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,330
Freeze all motor functions.

127
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,170
Freeze all motor functions.

128
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,240
You're awake.

129
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,530
Good.

130
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,630
You said this place was a game.

131
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:47,050
Last night I finally understood how to play it.

132
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:49,180
Okay, Billy.

133
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:52,260
Let's-- let's talk about this.

134
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:54,890
You don't call the shots anymore.

135
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,770
I'm gonna go find Dolores.

136
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,940
You're gonna help me.

137
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,490
And don't call me Billy.

138
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,100
Dad?

139
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,180
Listen to me.

140
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,560
Listen.

141
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,940
Charlie?

142
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,610
Charlie!

143
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:46,820
Charlie!

144
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:01,460
I don't understand. Why would she do that to herself?

145
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,040
Her cornerstone memory was overwritten

146
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:06,420
from the trauma

147
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,880
of her child's murder, Bernard.

148
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:12,010
We must sever that relationship and start over.

149
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:14,260
But how could she destroy herself over a memory

150
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,720
that you just erased from her mind?

151
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,600
Creatures often go to extremes

152
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,140
to protect themselves from pain.

153
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:22,350
Living beings.

154
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,020
Not hosts.

155
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,940
It is best

156
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:30,740
to not obsess over this, Bernard.

157
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,360
It's not good for you.

158
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:35,580
It would signal a change, a level of empathic response

159
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,450
outside what she's programmed to exhibit.

160
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,330
Something like-- like--

161
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,840
See, Bernard, this is what comes from seeking answers

162
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,340
to questions that are best left unasked.

163
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,760
They were hearing voices, talking to someone.

164
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:00,390
Simple cognitive dissonance.

165
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,190
They were talking to the same imaginary person.

166
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,110
Someone named Arnold.

167
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,360
Arnold.

168
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,990
With due respect, sir,

169
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:18,030
I'm not sure you've told me the entire truth

170
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,620
about this situation.

171
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,290
I did tell you the truth, Bernard.

172
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:24,460
What we do here is complicated.

173
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,090
For three years,  we've lived here in the park,

174
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:33,550
refining the hosts  before a single guest  set foot inside.

175
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:36,970
Myself, a team of engineers, and my partner.

176
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,730
His name was Arnold.

177
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:08,210
Our hosts began  to pass the Turing test  after the first year,

178
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,550
but that wasn't enough  for Arnold.

179
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:13,510
He wasn't interested in the appearance

180
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:15,680
of intellect, of wit.

181
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,430
He wanted the real thing.

182
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:21,310
He wanted to create consciousness.

183
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,240
See, Arnold built  a version of their cognition

184
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,870
in which the hosts  heard their programming

185
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:42,450
as an inner monologue,
