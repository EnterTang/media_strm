1
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:10,730
Hey, guys.

2
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,690
In six hours, you shall meet me...

3
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,180
and receive a deadly punishment.

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,830
(It's time for the deadly punishment.)

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,830
(The sun has set, and it's time to receive the penalty.)

6
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,220
("You won't be in your right mind.")

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,650
("All you will want to do is escape.")

8
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,580
(It's famous in Incheon for its frightening angle.)

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,260
(It's the roughest pirate ship in the world.)

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,600
(It's a pirate ship on Wolmido Island.)

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,620
(And...)

12
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,880
(a man waits for them.)

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,260
(Who is he, sitting in front of a pirate ship?)

14
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,030
(David McInnis)

15
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,390
Hello.

16
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,850
(It's David, the man who warned them about their upcoming penalty.)

17
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,020
It's David McInnis.

18
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,020
(Should we greet him or fear him?)

19
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,060
Hey.

20
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,820
(They greet each other with swag.)

21
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:05,920
Oh my goodness.

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,180
Why is David here?

23
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,190
(Why is David here?)

24
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,080
This is your last chance.

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,280
David will ask each of you a question.

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,510
You must reply with either a "Yes" or a "No".

27
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,210
Your answer will determine...

28
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,860
whether or not you will ride the pirate ship.

29
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,350
- It's nice to meet you.
 -  Nice to meet you.

30
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,070
- I'm your fan.
 -  You're my fan? I'm your fan.

31
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,960
- Thank you, Bro.
 -  Thank you.

32
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,730
You should call me "Big Brother".

33
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,680
- Big Bro.
 -  Good.

34
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,980
(David begins to ask the final questions.)

35
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,550
Okay, I'm going to give you one question.

36
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:36,560
Yes.

37
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,850
You're going to have three seconds to answer that.

38
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,570
- Got it, three seconds.
 -  Okay.

39
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,300
You might not like this question,

40
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,520
but if you're a thrill seeker, you might like it.

41
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,660
But if not,

42
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,060
you won't.

43
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,550
So, are you ready to face your punishment?

44
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,660
You don't like?

45
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,440
Yes or no?

46
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,150
- Three. Two.
 -  Is that his question?

47
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,050
(Seok Jin has no idea what the question was.)

48
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,650
(What is his decision?)

49
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,330
- No.
 -  I think that's wrong.

50
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,130
- That's tough.
 -  He just answered.

51
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,420
- All right. Seok Jin.
 -  Yes.

52
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,820
(Seok Jin said no.)

53
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:15,530
(Will he be able to avoid the penalty?)

54
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,850
(He's...)

55
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:18,920
(safe.)

56
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,230
Yes.

57
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,770
(Seok Jin will not ride the pirate ship.)

58
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,220
- Yes!
 -  Does he not have to ride it?

59
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,560
- He avoided the penalty.
 -  Thank you.

60
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,820
- Did he get it right?
 -  Did you choose...

61
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,780
- between yes and no?
 -  I just guessed.

62
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,250
I might be the only one riding the ship.

63
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,660
- I just guessed.
 -  No way.

64
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,620
You don't want to say you will ride a pirate ship,

65
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,570
but you can't say you won't...

66
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,760
because you don't have a choice.

67
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,910
So you're going to be honest with me.

68
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:47,250
He said a long sentence, but the only word I understood was "choice".

69
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,900
Would you rather die...

70
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,590
or live...

71
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,960
and ride a pirate ship?

72
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,410
- Live, live.
 -  Live, live.

73
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:00,300
Okay. So now, it's your choice. Yes or no?

74
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,450
Oh, my.

75
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,550
(I have a master's degree.)

76
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,660
Do you choose not to ride the pirate ship?

77
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,460
I'm going mad.

78
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,960
Please.

79
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:10,850
(What will Haha say?)

80
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,410
Yes.

81
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,110
Do you want to ride the ship or not?

82
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,310
Haha.

83
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,830
(Will Haha be able to avoid the penalty?)

84
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,380
(I really don't want to ride the pirate ship.)

85
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,880
- You'll ride the ship.
 -  Oh, no!

86
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,020
(Haha will ride the pirate ship.)

87
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:31,090
(Oh my goodness.)

88
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,740
Really?

89
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,880
(That's too bad.)

90
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,560
- Haha couldn't avoid the penalty.
 -  He has to ride the ship.

91
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,220
Now, regardless of your will,

92
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,450
you will eventually choose to ride the pirate ship.

93
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,570
No.

94
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,520
You may eventually have to ride the pirate ship.

95
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,830
What do you say? Yes or no?

96
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,750
(Ji Won's answer is no.)

97
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,790
No.

98
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,630
What's the result?

99
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,980
(She avoids the penalty.)

100
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,120
Yes.

101
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,450
(It's a series of successes.)

102
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,580
(All three of them avoid the penalty.)

103
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,960
They got lucky.

104
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,290
Is that it?

105
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,030
Yes.

106
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,050
- Kwang Soo will ride the ship.
 -  I knew he would.

107
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,220
That was great.

108
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,760
(That was perfect.)

109
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,480
(You'll be riding the pirate ship.)

110
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,960
- Why?
 -  What are you doing?

111
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,230
- Why?
 -  Put your hat back on.

112
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,950
(Three people have to ride the pirate ship.)

113
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,930
Put your seatbelts on and hold on tight.

114
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,430
I really hate this. Gosh.

115
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,780
- Can you move over a bit?
 -  Can you lower the safety bar?

116
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,990
It's tight on me.

117
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,760
I'm not really good at this.

118
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,500
Please, don't do this. Stop.

119
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:35,420
- Producer! Please stop this!
 -  It looks scary.

120
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,550
Look at Gary.

121
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,440
- Gary looks so handsome.
 -  Producer!

122
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,120
- Look at Gary.
 -  No.

123
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,380
(He shuts his eyes tight.)

124
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,520
My stomach feels funny.

125
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,180
The ship goes really high up.

126
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,690
(The pirate ship of Wolmido Island swings up high in an instant.)

127
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,680
(That's why it's called the "crazy pirate ship".)

128
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,400
Oh my goodness.

129
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,500
Help me.

130
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:55,060
Goodness. Keep your eyes closed. Don't open your eyes.

131
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,350
Don't open your eyes. Why is this ride so long?

132
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,590
I really hate this.

133
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,080
(They experience the horrifying feeling of falling.)

134
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,260
I'm falling. I'm falling.

135
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,420
(They both feel fear and rage.)

136
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,090
Gosh. I'm sorry.

137
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,950
Please. Please.

138
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:16,030
(Why did I get it wrong?)

139
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,960
(One decision can change everything.)

140
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,180
(There are chairs...)

141
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,960
(by a pool.)

142
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,730
Look, chairs are set up.

143
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,030
- What are they for?
 -  They are flying chairs.

144
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,730
What are these for?

145
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,750
It's outside.

146
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,860
(Welcome to the splash pool.)

147
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,850
- What are we doing?
 -  All right.

148
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,880
The game for today is "Find the No Man".

149
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,110
"Find the No Man?"

150
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,940
- Do we have to say no?
 -  How do we play this game?

151
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,980
We will tell you more about today's game in just a second.

152
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,650
We have three special guests for today.

153
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,240
- Do we have three guests?
 -  I think so.

154
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,420
- Who are they?
 -  It won't be fun if I tell you.

155
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,640
- Okay.
 -  They can be inside.

156
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,070
To find out who the guests are,

157
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,760
we prepared a game called, "Dangerous No."

158
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,280
- Please take your seat at the back.
 -  It's a mind game.

159
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,720
- Please take a seat.
 -  All right.

160
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,820
- Okay.
 -  The producer is dangerous.

161
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,490
He prepared a series of dangerous games.

162
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,220
Okay. I'll sit here.

163
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,530
Does it matter where we sit?

164
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,380
We might not have to go in the water.

165
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,680
- What is that?
 -  I don't want to get in the pool.

166
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,250
- I got this.
 -  Seok Jin.

167
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,820
- Yes?
 -  Don't you think the viewers...

168
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,580
will think it's rude of you to be wearing sunglasses?

169
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,930
- I have to. It's bright out here.
 -  I see.

170
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,380
(He's in his 50s so he needs his sunglasses.)

171
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,460
He has to.

172
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,950
- I'm sorry, everyone.
 -  That's funny.

173
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,320
I want sunglasses, too.

174
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,950
I apologise to all the viewers.

175
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,620
(It's because I'm getting old.)

176
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,380
- You will be asking questions.
 -  Okay.

177
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,020
The guest will answer your questions.

178
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,870
- I see.
 -  The answer will be a yes or a no.

179
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,080
You won't be penalised if the guest answers yes.

180
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,850
- What?
 -  If he says no...

181
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,360
- That's tough.
 -  Who gets to say no?

182
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,650
- Will the guest say no?
 -  Yes.

183
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,200
If you find out who the guest is,

184
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,380
the guest will be thrown into the pool.

185
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,150
- Really?
 -  Okay.

186
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,690
- We must find out who the guest is.
 -  Let's do this, everyone.

187
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,420
- Don't ask simple questions.
 -  All right.

188
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,350
- Ask questions that will help us.
 -  Okay. Let's go.

189
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,620
- Don't ask obvious questions.
 -  Okay.

190
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,080
Don't ask questions like, "Are you human?"

191
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,320
- We must do well.
 -  We should.

192
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,580
All right. Shall we begin?

193
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,330
Okay. Please come out.

194
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,650
If the guest answers no, we'll be thrown into the water.

195
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,740
- Hello.
 -  Nice to meet you.

196
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,280
(They don't have a clue.)

197
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,810
Hi, all.

198
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,550
- I think it's a guy.
 -  Is it male or female?

199
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,420
- In my opinion, the guest...
 -  It's a guy.

200
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,130
hasn't been on that many variety shows.

201
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,340
He's very cautious.

202
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,850
- Let's ask his occupation and age.
 -  Let's do that.

203
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:33,920
- I will ask him a question.
 -  Okay.

204
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,250
(This one question will determine their fate.)

205
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,350
Are you...

206
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:41,180
(First question)

207
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,560
an actor?

208
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,920
(Is the man behind the curtain an actor?)

209
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,260
Yes.

210
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:48,990
(They don't have to go in the water.)

211
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,160
- This is crazy.
 -  Okay.

212
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,280
Are you...

213
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,420
(Second question)

214
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,650
in your 30s?

215
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,220
(Second question: Are you in your 30s?)

216
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,320
Yes!

217
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,680
- Yes.
 -  He's in his 30s!

218
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,840
- He's an actor in his 30s.
 -  An actor in his 30s.

219
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,930
He's an actor in his 30s.

220
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,880
Ask him if he's handsome.

221
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,250
Ask him if he has a hit song.

222
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,750
I don't want to ask him if he thinks he is handsome.

223
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,350
Listening to his voice makes me think that he's not.

224
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,850
- What?
 -  But still...

225
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,080
- What's the logic in that?
 -  I know.

226
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,150
- I know it.
 -  What is that?

227
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,520
- I am certain about it.
 -  I have no expectations.

228
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,580
- His voice is hinting that...
 -  Let's ask about his work.

229
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,030
- Ask him.
 -  Ask him about his famous work.

230
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,950
Have you starred in a movie that sold over 10 million tickets?

231
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,150
That's a good one.

232
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,360
- Is he a well-known actor?
 -  All right.

233
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,950
Have you ever starred in a movie...

234
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:31,580
that sold over 10 million tickets?

235
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,090
(Third question: Have you ever starred in a movie...)

236
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,250
(that sold over 10 million tickets?)

237
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,260
No.

238
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,160
- No?
 -  Oh, dear.

239
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:41,280
(Falling)

240
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,060
(Have a taste of "No".)

241
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,480
(Jae Seok shows us how it's done.)

242
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,960
(You instantly become ugly.)

243
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,090
This is really tough.

244
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,440
- He's not a top actor then.
 -  This is ridiculous.

245
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,590
- It's terrifying.
 -  Jae Seok.

246
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,720
- It's freezing!
 -  Jae Seok.

247
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,440
- The water is unbelievably cold.
 -  Are you okay?

248
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,270
- It's unbelievably cold.
 -  This is absurd.

249
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,370
- Gosh, it's cold.
 -  I can't do it! Wait!

250
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,750
- Is it that bad?
 -  It's cold!

251
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,570
This is ice water.

252
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,840
Hey!

253
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,920
Come and put some water on your chest.

254
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,550
- You have to get ready.
 -  Hold on.

255
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,650
It's crazy.

256
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,760
(Everyone's shocked by the power of "No".)

257
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,580
- Where's my towel?
 -  Is it really cold?

258
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,850
What's this? Kwang Soo!

259
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,040
What?

260
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,460
(Ji Hyo is terrified.)

261
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,920
What did you just do?

262
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,690
- You should experience it.
 -  Ji Hyo, you should just go home.

263
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,180
You're being so difficult.

264
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,040
- No!
 -  Just go home.

265
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,780
You are extremely moody today.

266
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,420
- Gosh...
 -  Jae Seok.

267
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,130
Ask him about his character, Kwang Soo.

268
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,720
Ask him if he normally plays a cool role or a funny role.

269
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,150
- That's a very subjective question.
 -  Listen.

270
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,590
- Ask him if he plays the bad guy.
 -  Ask him if he plays the villain.

271
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,950
Or ask him if he usually plays a funny character.

272
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,090
(They give Kwang Soo suggestions on what to ask.)

273
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,680
You're just trying to get me in the water!

274
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,870
No, I'm not.

275
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,250
- What kind of a question is that?
 -  Don't worry.

276
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,880
We need to know so that we can guess who it is.

277
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,750
Why don't you ask if he's been on Running Man before?

278
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,010
- Yes. Ask him that.
 -  Okay.

279
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,820
- Have you...
 -  It will narrow the list down.

280
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,180
been on Running Man before?

281
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,120
(Fourth question)

282
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,680
(Have we met before?)

283
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,220
No.

284
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,390
- See?
 -  Never?

285
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,020
(It's his first time to be on Running Man.)

286
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,220
(Why have you never appeared on Running Man?)

287
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,630
(Are you Cho Sae Ho?)

288
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,290
(Falling)

289
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,960
I told you.

290
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,120
You should've asked if he's been on other variety shows.

291
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,950
(Kwang Soo is shocked by the cold water.)

292
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,150
It's very cold.

293
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,360
Kwang Soo, you shouldn't have asked that question.

294
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,030
It's just like ice water.

295
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,110
Maybe we should put some water on our bodies.

296
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,680
Put some on your chest then.

297
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,100
- Should I?
 -  Get your body used to it.

298
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,650
(Something feels strange.)

299
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,780
- What's wrong?
 -  Hey.

300
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,920
- I didn't do anything.
 -  What are you doing?

301
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,590
- I didn't do anything.
 -  Be careful.

302
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,160
If you push me, that's the end of our friendship.

303
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,330
Hey!

304
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,540
You little...

305
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,230
(Jae Seok doesn't hesitate to end their friendship.)

306
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,090
It's cold! It's cold!

307
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,030
- It's too cold.
 -  It's not that bad.

308
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,720
(Seok Jin is destined to be tortured for life.)

309
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,720
It's more difficult because he's never been on Running Man.

310
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,650
That's why I said he's new to variety shows.

311
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,580
- He doesn't do variety shows.
 -  How about this one?

312
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,250
"Have you ever wanted to appear on Running Man?"

313
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,420
- What's that?
 -  No. No.

314
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,550
He'll say yes.

315
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,680
- Don't ask questions like that.
 -  Do you think he will say...

316
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,370
- he wanted to be on another show?
 -  Don't ask that.

317
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,470
- This is hard.
 -  Ji Hyo.

318
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,320
- Let's ask him if he's married.
 -  Okay.

319
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,820
- Let's ask him that.
 -  Yes, ask him if he's married.

320
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,020
I don't think he's married.

321
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,950
Most people in their 30s aren't married.

322
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,500
Then ask him if he's single.

323
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,750
Are you single?

324
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,480
(Fifth question)

325
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,360
- Yes.
 -  He's not married.

326
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,550
- Seok Jin.
 -  What should we ask him next?

327
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,140
How can I guess who he is without knowing his last name?

328
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,380
Let's ask him what his last name is.

329
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,620
- Yes. Let's ask him that.
 -  We do need to know that.

330
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,010
- I'll ask him.
 -  Narrow it down.

331
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,150
Is your last name...

332
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,380
(It's Seok Jin's time to ask.)

333
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,260
Is your last name Kim, Lee or Park?

334
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:55,580
(Will Seok Jin get lucky this time?)

335
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,690
- Yes.
 -  Oh, my.

336
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,350
- We should just pick one.
 -  Just take a guess.

337
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,820
He's never been on Running Man. His last name is Kim, Lee or Park.

338
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,550
- Shouldn't we discuss it first?
 -  Let's ask him this question.

339
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,550
"Did you recently shoot a TV series?"

340
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,260
No, let's ask him about his upcoming gig.

341
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,620
- He must have one.
 -  I'm sure he came...

342
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,430
- to promote it.
 -  Right.

343
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,130
- That's possible.
 -  Let's ask him.

344
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,350
- Ask him.
 -  Go on.

345
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,290
Should I ask him if he came here to promote his work?

346
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,350
- I will ask him...
 -  He came to promote his movie.

347
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,600
Ask him if his movie is going to be released soon.

348
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,590
- Excuse me.
 -  Yes.

349
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,150
By any chance, is your movie going to be released soon?

350
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,150
(Last question)

351
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,260
Yes.

352
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,490
(Yes!)

353
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,150
- We were right.
 -  I think I can guess.

354
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,620
You know a lot about upcoming movies, right?

355
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,930
- Which ones are coming out?
 -  What are the upcoming movies?

356
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,120
That's...

357
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,020
(Well...)

358
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,040
- He doesn't know.
 -  The one with Captain America.

359
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,280
(Captain America is most likely in America.)

360
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,380
Not that one.

361
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,750
- Gosh.
 -  Is that all you know?

362
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,250
That's an American movie.

363
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,050
There are too many movies coming out.

364
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,150
I know. There are too many.

365
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,550
Let's think about this.

366
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,150
He's an actor in his 30s with the last name of Kim, Lee or Park.

367
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,580
Park? So it's one of those three.

368
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,220
- Is he Park Hae Il?
 -  He was on "Radio Star".

369
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,060
- Is it Lee Je Hoon?
 -  Is he Park Hae Il?

370
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,850
- Is it Je Hoon?
 -  Is he Hae Il?

371
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,120
- It must be Je Hoon!
 -  Je Hoon!

372
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,530
- He has a movie coming out.
 -  Is he in his 30s?

373
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,650
- Yes, he is.
 -  He is...

374
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,430
The producer looks frustrated.

375
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,180
- It's Je Hoon!
 -  It must be Je Hoon!

376
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,050
- It's Je Hoon.
 -  It's Je Hoon and Go A Ra.

377
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,820
- He never appeared on Running Man.
 -  Are you sure about this?

378
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,020
Is he the one that starred in "Signal"?

379
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,080
Is he older than you?

380
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,320
- He's older than me.
 -  It's Je Hoon from "Signal".

381
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,420
I think I saw the poster.

382
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,670
- I am his biggest fan.
 -  His movie's coming out soon.

383
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,430
The other guest must be A Ra then.

384
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,230
- Look. He's not laughing.
 -  Is that right?

385
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,480
(They give a bitter smile.)

386
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,720
- It's Je Hoon!
 -  It must be him!

387
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,920
- It's him!
 -  Let's go with Je Hoon.

388
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,820
- It's Je Hoon.
 -  Let's go with him.

389
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,680
Look at them. They look upset.

390
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,050
- In 1, 2, 3.
 -  I think we guessed it right.

391
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,850
If it's Je Hoon, automatically the female guest is A Ra.

392
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,090
I will ask if she's A Ra for the first question.

393
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,820
- Okay. Great.
 -  That will do.

394
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,820
- That's great.
 -  Let's go.

395
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,720
- She'll be thrown in immediately.
 -  Let's hurry up.

396
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,320
- All right. I have the answer.
 -  What is it?

397
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,430
It's Lee Je Hoon.

398
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,390
(I might be wrong.)

399
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,280
I'm dead.

400
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,580
- He just said that he's dead.
 -  Did we get it?

401
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,790
- Did you hear what he said?
 -  Is it really him?

402
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,080
Let's see if you got it right.

403
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,580
(Did the Running Man members guess right?)

404
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,050
Please come on out, Je Hoon.

405
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,180
(It's Lee Je Hoon.)

406
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,750
- We did it!
 -  Yes!

407
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,020
- We got it!
 -  We did it!

408
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,150
- We guessed it right.
 -  I know!

409
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,120
- We got it correct.
 -  Oh, dear.

410
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,750
- Poor him.
 -  That wasn't that hard.

411
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,960
I feel bad for you.

412
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,120
- Je Hoon!
 -  Hello!

413
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,680
- Hello!
 -  It's nice to meet you.

414
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,050
- It's really him.
 -  Oh, dear.

415
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,060
(The actor in his 30s is Lee Je Hoon.)

416
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,980
(In the TV series "Signal", he played the role of Park Hae Young!)

417
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:34,830
(Not only is he handsome, but his acting was also superb.)

418
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,350
- Welcome!
 -  Hello.

419
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,820
- Oh, dear.
 -  Hi.

420
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,080
- It's really him.
 -  Gosh...

421
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,250
- Lieutenant.
 -  Je Hoon.

422
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,780
(I should've had my poker face on.)

423
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,160
You said you've never been on Running Man.

424
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,720
So I thought it could be you.

425
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,120
- I shouldn't have said anything.
 -  Look at his nose.

426
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,580
- Why did you say it?
 -  Will Je Hoon go in the water?

427
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,350
I didn't know it was Je Hoon.

428
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,270
(Haha approaches Je Hoon.)

429
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,650
You can keep talking.

430
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:58,080
- I will take your mic.
 -  He needs to take a dip.

431
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,780
Shouldn't we talk to him first before he goes in?

432
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,080
Look at his body. You can tell he works out.

433
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,480
- Goodness.
 -  Look at that.

434
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,620
Je Hoon.

435
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,820
You need to get ready.

436
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,050
(He gets a cold water massage.)

437
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,630
- It's cold.
 -  It's cold, isn't it?

438
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,730
(It's time for you to go in the water.)

439
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,950
It's his first time on Running Man.

440
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,680
(Je Hoon will dive in now.)

441
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,150
I'm a big fan of his.

442
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,730
Please say hello to our viewers.

443
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,690
Hello, everyone.

444
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,980
- I'm in "Phantom Detective".
 -  That's right!

445
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,780
I am actor Lee Je Hoon. Hello.

446
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,550
(He greets the viewers,)

447
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,830
(and takes a dive.)

448
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,590
(We won't cut him slack just because he's handsome.)

449
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:37,520
(We hope he will enjoy the cool, refreshing water.)

450
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,530
He looks good.

451
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,230
(Look at his body!)

452
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,360
(He has broad shoulders.)

453
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,350
Take a picture!

454
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,480
(They are amazed.)

455
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,850
- Get him on camera.
 -  He's got a great body.

456
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,020
Hurry.

457
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,650
(His face glows even more with water.)

458
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,230
That is crazy.

459
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,950
Look at his abs.

460
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,130
Don't give him a towel.

461
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,380
- Don't let him dry off.
 -  Just leave the towels there.

462
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,520
He looks great.

463
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,550
- You look good.
 -  Don't give him a towel.

464
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,680
He is handsome.

465
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,910
- Look at his body.
 -  Look at his muscles.

466
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,960
It's great.

467
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,450
Look at his muscles.

468
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,520
(We love you, Lieutenant Park.)

469
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,710
He's so handsome.

470
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,140
(Even Seok Jin's heart skips a beat.)

471
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,450
He has a great body.

472
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,720
- Oh, dear.
 -  Look at how...

473
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,130
- his muscles are so cut.
 -  It's impressive.

474
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,320
Can you do this once?

475
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,640
- Do this.
 -  I think you can handle it.

476
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,590
(He's muscular.)

477
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,760
(They can't help but clap and cheer for him.)

478
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,690
- All right.
 -  Did you see his abs?

479
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,040
- Please take a seat.
 -  Okay.

480
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,790
Is our next guest Go A Ra?

481
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,150
- A Ra is here, isn't she?
 -  Here we go.

482
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,280
Just get it right.

483
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,280
I think you had a tough time guessing the first guess.

484
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,870
We will allow you to use the Guest Card from now on.

485
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,280
You can ask Je Hoon to ask the questions for you.

486
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,470
Okay. That sounds great!

487
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,820
If the guest says no when Je Hoon asks the question,

488
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,820
- all of you will fall in.
 -  Okay.

489
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,980
Do you understand?

490
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,850
- What?
 -  You're really handsome.

491
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:56,950
Let's begin.

492
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,660
Please say hello.

493
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,130
- Hello.
 -  It's Go A Ra!

494
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,580
(They guessed right.)

495
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,250
- It's A Ra.
 -  Should we go for it?

496
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,750
- It's her!
 -  Should I say her name?

497
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,020
- They could've changed the voice.
 -  We need to wait for our turns.

498
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,350
- I'm sure it's a woman.
 -  Is that so?

499
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,480
(Laughing)

500
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,350
- It's a woman.
 -  A Ra,

501
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,760
are you...

502
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:17,980
female?

503
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,250
(First question)

504
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,630
- No.
 -  Oh my gosh!

505
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,290
(It's not Go A Ra.)

506
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,740
Did we guess wrong?

507
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,130
- What?
 -  Oh, no.

508
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,650
Is it a man?

509
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,730
(Splashing)

510
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,720
- Is it not Go A Ra?
 -  It's a guy.

511
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,820
It's a guy?

512
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,320
Wow, he looks like a squid!

513
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,570
It's so cold!

514
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,130
- He looks tasty.
 -  It's seriously cold!

515
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,460
Is it not Go A Ra?

516
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,450
That voice belongs to a guy?

517
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,050
- It's a guy, then.
 -  It is.

518
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,520
- It's a guy?
 -  What should I ask?

519
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,980
Shall we use the Guest Card?

520
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,250
- Should I use it?
 -  Do it.

521
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:53,180
- I'll use the Guest Card.
 -  He can make us dive if he wants.

522
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,950
Je Hoon, this is a question of your conscience.

523
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,680
- Please help us.
 -  Give us a hint.

524
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,930
- This person is funny.
 -  Funny?

525
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:02,280
Are you a comedian, by any chance?

526
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,850
- No way!
 -  That's not it!

527
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,750
- What are you doing?
 -  Oh, come on.

528
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,090
- Je Hoon...
 -  Well...

529
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,660
No!

530
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:14,230
(They all dive into the water.)

531
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,430
(Giggling)

532
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,750
(Screaming)

533
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:27,490
(They can feel the chilling water in their bones.)

534
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,060
- It's so cold!
 -  It's cold!

535
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,280
(He's deeply satisfied.)

536
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,060
- It's cold!
 -  My back is burning!

537
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,880
Gosh, my back!

538
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,190
It's cold.

539
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:41,730
(They are in dire need of sunlight to warm them.)

540
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,690
(Screaming)

541
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,440
(Je Hoon plays along.)

542
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,170
Gosh, it's so cold!

543
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,590
It's burning.

544
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,980
- My back is burning.
 -  Goodness!

545
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,800
My back is burning so much!

546
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,350
All right, Je Hoon.

547
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,940
That was a good first impression, Je Hoon.

548
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,730
- Let's do this.
 -  Okay, Je Hoon.

549
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,140
Hey, your hair turned into spaghetti.

550
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,850
- It's spaghetti.
 -  I'm getting hungry.

551
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,220
(Slurping)

552
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,660
- It's spaghetti.
 -  Spaghetti?

553
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,160
Is the restaurant open today?

554
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:22,260
(His hair resembles the entrance of a Chinese restaurant.)

555
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,770
Is the restaurant open today?

556
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:28,030
- Are you open?
 -  Is this a Chinese restaurant?

557
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,460
You should create a new nickname for him.

558
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,850
You made me the squid.

559
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,790
Make sure you add subtitles.

560
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,050
You have to turn his hair into spaghetti.

561
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,710
(The newly released menu is called squid spaghetti.)

562
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:43,260
We can handle it, but the cameraman in the water is cold.

563
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:48,360
- It's really cold.
 -  It's part of his job.

564
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,970
- Are you serious?
 -  You're too harsh.

565
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,080
(Seok Jin is brutal.)

566
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,380
Come on, Seok Jin.

567
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,720
(Seok Jin is brutal.)

568
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,320
That's not nice.

569
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,150
- It's part of his job.
 -  Watch what you say.

570
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,480
They'd rather work than stay home and do nothing.

571
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,580
- Come on.
 -  They look best when they work.

572
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,380
- Come on.
 -  "They look best"?

573
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,730
All right, it's my turn now.

574
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,220
Are you in your 40s?

575
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,250
(Are you in your 40s?)

576
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,460
- No.
 -  Oh, dear.

577
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,980
Only we got to ask a question.

578
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,560
(Exclaiming)

579
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,720
He's not in his 40s. He might be in his 20s.

580
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,790
- Are you cold?
 -  My back hit the floor.

581
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,420
It's part of your job.

582
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,960
(It's part of his job.)

583
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,450
Would you rather stay home...

584
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,880
- Or work here?
 -  or burn your back?

585
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,950
(Everyone should work.)

586
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:35,530
- You look best when you work.
 -  Exactly.

587
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,750
It's part of your job.

588
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,050
- That's why you are a comedian.
 -  The cameramen are laughing hard.

589
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,630
- Aren't you happy?
 -  What a man.

590
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,220
- It's... It's part of my job.
 -  Right.

591
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,650
He's so positive now.

592
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:51,450
- Burning your back is part of it.
 -  Right, I should enjoy my job.

593
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,930
- Exactly.
 -  Right?

594
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,820
- Who was in the movie?
 -  Can you remember?

595
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:01,960
(Who's starring in the same movie alongside Je Hoon?)

596
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,760
- Kim Sung Kyun?
 -  Hold on.

597
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,280
- Try it.
 -  Go for it.

598
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,220
- Is it Kim Sung Kyun?
 -  It's him.

599
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,460
Is it him?

600
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:12,750
- I think it is.
 -  Was he in the trailer?

601
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,150
It might be him.

602
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,150
Look at his face. We're right.

603
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,980
It's not him.

604
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,250
It is Kim Sung Kyun, no?

605
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,550
- It must be him.
 -  It is Sung Kyun.

606
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,380
- It is him.
 -  Kim Sung Kyun!

607
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,580
It has to be him.

608
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,990
Je Hoon will reveal the answer.

609
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,080
What if it's not him?

610
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,050
(Je Hoon will reveal the answer.)

611
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,430
What if it's not him?

612
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,550
Sung Kyun, you're caught. Come out.

613
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,850
(Je Hoon calls Sung Kyun out.)

614
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:39,450
(They got it right again.)

615
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,180
- We're so good.
 -  This is our day.

616
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,030
- That's great.
 -  What did I say?

617
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,760
We wouldn't have guessed it without Ji Hyo.

618
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,730
Hello!

619
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,720
Do you like pizza?

620
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,880
(He has played diverse roles...)

621
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,220
Let's go!

622
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,720
(and he's proven himself to be a scene-stealer.)

623
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,130
Nice to meet you Nice to meet you

624
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,180
I love him.

625
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,950
- I watched all of it.
 -  You are looking good.

626
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,450
You do look much better.

627
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,320
You don't have a mic on you, right? Let's take it off.

628
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,820
- Really?
 -  He wore a nice suit though.

629
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,020
He wore a nice suit, but he has to take it off.

630
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,820
Sung Kyun looks so much nicer now.

631
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,790
This is really something.

632
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:20,020
- It's your first time, right?
 -  Don't worry, you won't fly.

633
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,390
Please say hi.

634
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:25,780
My name is Kim Sung Kyun and I'll be acting the role of Kang Sung Il.

635
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,490
- Bye, bye.
 -  See you.

636
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,860
(Nice to meet you.)

637
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:35,290
(This is his first and last greeting.)

638
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,160
He's in.

639
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,090
(Giggling)

640
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:48,820
- Lie down.
 -  Lie here. It's cold.

641
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,790
(You must dry yourself.)

642
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,890
- Isn't it warm here?
 -  You must be cold.

643
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,470
That's funny.

644
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:57,620
- It's A Ra's turn next.
 -  A Ra!

645
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,750
- It's A Ra.
 -  It must be A Ra.

646
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,250
It has to be.

647
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,630
(They have no doubt it's her.)

648
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:05,720
Shall we still give it a go?

649
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,130
Let's hear your voice. Hello.

650
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:13,960
- Hello.
 -  A Ra!

651
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,280
- A Ra.
 -  Hello, A Ra.

652
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,640
- Go A Ra!
 -  Show us your beautiful face.

653
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,520
Is your last name "Go"?

654
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,380
(Is her last name Go?)

655
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,630
Yes...

656
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,650
(It has to be Go A Ra.)

657
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:31,200
- It has to be her.
 -  What should I ask?

658
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,420
Are you an actress? Actually, have you been on Running Man?

659
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,480
(Has she been on Running Man?)

660
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,660
Yes.

661
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,880
(Has she been on Running Man?)

662
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,250
- We know who it is.
 -  We do.

663
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:43,760
You are the beautiful woman that we know, right?

664
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,930
No.

665
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,830
(Bye, Jae Seok!)

666
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,530
What was that about?

667
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,800
My goodness, that was funny.

668
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,930
- She's so modest.
 -  Hey!

669
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:02,360
- You shouldn't have asked.
 -  Hey, hold on!

670
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:03,930
Hold on!

671
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,890
This is really no joke!

672
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,950
- Hey, then...
 -  It's her opinion.

673
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,450
You can't ask an actor if he thinks he's handsome.

674
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,750
Oh, dear.

675
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,680
(She got on his nerve.)

676
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,550
I'll get it right. She angered me, so I'll just guess it right.

677
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,780
Right, dump her in the water.

678
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,920
- Gosh!
 -  Save me, Jae Seok!

679
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,780
(Screaming)

680
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,270
- What was that about?
 -  What's she saying?

681
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:29,570
- What's she saying?
 -  I don't want to get soaked!

682
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,350
Then why did you infuriate me?

683
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,980
- I love you, Jae Seok!
 -  Come on!

684
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,880
- We have to throw her in the water.
 -  Of course!

685
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,960
- Let's dump her in!
 -  Let's go.

686
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,670
Would Jae Seok really...

687
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:42,180
let an actress get soaked?

688
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,750
- Of course.
 -  He's changed a lot.

689
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:48,380
But we came this far, so we can't play dumb.

690
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,720
- That doesn't make any sense.
 -  Viewers won't like that.

691
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,220
Viewers won't like that.

692
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,830
You better not say Ko Chang Seok.

693
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,420
Don't say something else.

694
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,530
If I say "Go Wa Ra", it's wrong, right?

695
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,680
- Don't do it!
 -  Don't do it!

696
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,050
Fine, you guys sound very angry.

697
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:05,580
- Why would he do this?
 -  It's obviously Go A Ra.

698
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,720
What is it?

699
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,280
Is there anyone who'd take my place?

700
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,680
Just be quiet.

701
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,790
(Rejected)

702
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,790
We don't have such a thing.

703
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,820
What do you think?

704
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,880
(We don't show mercy to an actress.)

705
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,930
Come here!

706
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,860
- Jae Seok.
 -  Seriously.

707
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,750
A Ra is making me mad.

708
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,520
- Don't be easy on her!
 -  Just say her name!

709
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,080
- We are already soaked.
 -  It's so cold.

710
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,750
Say her name and she'll fall in the water.

711
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,580
Jae Seok, don't drench an actress.

712
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,590
- What?
 -  Don't let an actress get wet.

713
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:36,350
(Jong Kook is a gentleman.)

714
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,930
(What a man.)

715
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,120
(Let's protect women.)

716
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,350
What a man.

717
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,220
(Let's protect women.)

718
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,980
Don't make me laugh, you punk.

719
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,690
(You must be kidding.)

720
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:56,160
You are seriously funny! You really are!

721
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,620
I'll take care of it! I will!

722
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,520
Hey, this is not the time.

723
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,980
- I'm getting mad.
 -  Hey!

724
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,740
- Stop trying to look good.
 -  And what did you say?

725
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,550
- Quit it.
 -  I'm so mad.

726
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,680
- Gosh, that's funny.
 -  I'm going to call her name!

727
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,560
- Go for it.
 -  I can't take this any more!

728
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,350
- The answer is...
 -  Go for it.

729
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,820
(He is about to say the answer.)

730
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,490
Just say it!

731
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,630
(Annoyed)

732
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,100
I was about to say it!

733
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,120
You're really enraging me!

734
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,180
- Be quiet.
 -  A Ra.

735
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,780
A Ra must be getting mad, too.

736
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,350
- Count for me.
 -  In 1, 2, 3.

737
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,020
(He will really talk this time!)

738
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:36,280
(A Ra, are you ready for this?)

739
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,590
(Her heart is racing.)

740
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,650
(Will Jae Seok dump the actress into the water?)

741
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,330
- In 1, 2, 3.
 -  In 1, 2, 3.

742
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,980
Gu Ha Ra.

743
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,060
- Gu Ha Ra.
 -  Come on!

744
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,820
(She's happy,)

745
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,730
(but they're not.)

746
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:55,730
(Pandemonium follows.)

747
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,420
- Gosh!
 -  My goodness!

748
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,190
- Darn it!
 -  Thank you!

749
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,850
It's so cold!

750
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:04,980
(Save yourselves!)

751
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,130
(He lies down in the sun again.)

752
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:11,750
(He proves himself a gentleman once again.)

753
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,880
I couldn't!

754
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,880
So our last guest is Go A Ra!

755
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,930
(Go A Ra has a multitude of charms.)

756
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:23,220
(She looks innocent but played many unique roles.)

757
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,060
That's what he said.

758
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:28,720
- This is really nice.
 -  It is.

759
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,060
We have A Ra, Sung Kyun and Je Hoon with us.

760
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:34,420
- It's really nice.
 -  Let me explain today's mission.

761
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,050
It's called Find the No Man. There's only one answer.

762
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,620
And you should find the No Man.

763
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,700
- No Man?
 -  Yes.

764
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:45,280
The No Man is among you and you'll have to find out who it is.

765
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,450
If you find the No Man in three tries, Yes Men win.

766
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,960
But if you don't, the No Man wins.

767
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,550
Those who lose will get the mud bomb penalty.

768
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,730
Mud bomb?

769
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:57,720
I'll explain how you can guess the No Man.

770
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,080
We'll give you a question before you start each mission.

771
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,910
Then five members will become a team.

772
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:05,150
If there are only Yes Men in a team, the team's answer will be "Yes".

773
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:08,660
But the team with the No Man will automatically answer "No".

774
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,150
You will have to pay the price if your answer is wrong.

775
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,220
(No Man's team will always answer "No".)

776
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:15,180
If you win each game, you'll earn a Member Swapping Card.

777
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:18,120
You can either maintain the members or change three of them.

778
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,250
(You have the choice.)

779
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,820
So we have to find the No Man.

780
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,030
So we'll decide the No Man.

781
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,560
- Can you see the tent behind you?
 -  Yes.

782
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:30,240
When you enter it, you'll see many phones on a table.

783
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,190
Choose one of the phones.

784
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,550
Once you remove the battery,

785
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:37,450
you'll find either a "Yes" or a "No" sticker.

786
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:38,680
No one will know who it is.

787
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,850
If you choose the one with the "No" sticker,

788
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,320
you are the No Man.

789
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,190
(The one who chooses "No" will be the No Man.)

790
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,820
(Kwang Soo goes first.)

791
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,220
Do I choose whatever I want?

792
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,780
(Nervous)

793
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,360
(He removes the battery.)

794
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:58,360
(I am "blank" Man.)

795
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:05,780
(The members each choose a phone.)

796
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:11,590
(They all have ambiguous looks on their faces.)

797
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:16,850
(Everyone chose a phone.)

798
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,950
- Did you all check?
 -  Yes!

799
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:21,620
Then, I'll announce the first question.

800
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,980
- Okay.
 -  Here goes the first question.

801
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,490
(Here comes the first question.)

802
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,680
"Will you wear humiliating t-shirts?"

803
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,260
(Will you wear humiliating t-shirts?)

804
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:35,180
(Humiliating t-shirts?)

805
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,420
- Gosh!
 -  My goodness.

806
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,960
- I hate it!
 -  That's really humiliating!

807
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:40,520
(Behold!)

808
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,950
- That's unbelievable.
 -  Gosh.

809
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:43,130
Oh, dear!

810
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,330
- Gosh.
 -  It says "I'm younger than Haha".

811
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,990
(He's at a loss for words.)

812
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,980
Look at Jong Kook's.

813
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,350
That's when they shot air at my face.

814
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,820
I remember what is on Ji Hyo's shirt.

815
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,930
Look at hers.

816
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,960
Gosh, Song Ji Hyo. Goodness.

817
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,430
You are too mean to us.

818
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,580
- Gosh.
 -  Haha's photo is...

819
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,910
when he threw the ball in the opening ceremony of a baseball game.

820
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,120
Were you in pain or something?

821
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,880
(I want to be like Gary.)

822
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,520
Gary, yours isn't that bad.

823
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,640
But Haha's makes me mad.

824
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,950
- Look at A Ra's.
 -  Gosh.

825
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:17,450
- A Ra.
 -  What's that?

826
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,680
Kwang Soo's isn't humiliating at all.

827
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,050
That's how he looks every day.

828
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:23,700
- What do you mean?
 -  That's your everyday look.

829
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,990
What's that on Je Hoon's t-shirt? "Come on"?

830
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:31,020
We couldn't find any humiliating photos of Je Hoon.

831
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,180
Let's make one today!

832
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,490
(Let's make one today!)

833
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:36,880
- So you all saw your t-shirts.
 -  Yes.

834
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,050
- That's not that humiliating.
 -  Then,

835
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:41,520
five of you will have to wear the t-shirts.

836
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,750
- We must have the No Man with us.
 -  Right.

837
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:46,350
- We need the No Man in our team.
 -  No Man's team has the advantage.

838
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,860
We should be on No Man's team.

839
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,320
- Now, we'll form teams.
 -  Gosh.

840
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,050
The three guests will be divided into two teams first.

841
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,480
Then, they'll choose the members they want...

842
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,550
until each team has five members.

843
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,730
Okay.

844
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,920
- Rock-paper-scissors.
 -  Rock-paper-scissors.

845
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,980
(Je Hoon won.)

846
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,250
- Go ahead.
 -  Haha.

847
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,020
(Je Hoon picks Haha.)

848
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,090
- I'll pick Gary.
 -  Just choose him.

849
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:07,680
- You chose Gary.
 -  We need to choose the No Man.

850
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,650
Whom will you choose next?

851
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,220
- Good.
 -  He chose Ji Hyo.

852
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,850
- I'll choose Kwang Soo.
 -  Me?

853
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,820
(Je Hoon picks Kwang Soo.)

854
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,950
That's right. Kwang Soo could be the No Man.

855
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:19,100
- I'll choose Seok Jin.
 -  Yes.

856
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,950
- Good.
 -  You made a right choice.

857
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,330
- Good.
 -  I feel good.

858
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:24,480
I pick Jong Kook.

859
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,550
(Sung Kyun picks Jong Kook.)

860
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,920
Great.

861
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,220
I think one of you may be the No Man.

862
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,520
- Kwang Soo or...
 -  We're safe!

863
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,650
We never know.

864
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:33,950
(They are finished.)

865
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:37,620
- Are we done?
 -  Will you wear the t-shirts?

866
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,130
- Yes.
 -  No.

867
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,080
The team whose members will wear...

868
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,450
the humiliating t-shirts is...

869
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:47,980
(Which team will it be?)

870
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,680
(Je Hoon's team)

871
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,320
- We need to wear them.
 -  Gosh.

872
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,720
- We should've...
 -  It means the No Man is here.

873
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,750
- Who is the No Man?
 -  Who is it?

874
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,090
- Please go get changed.
 -  None of us is the No Man?

875
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,250
- The No Man isn't with us.
 -  Who's the No Man?

876
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:06,290
- It's not me.
 -  Gosh!

877
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:11,820
(The No Man is in Team Sung Kyun.)

878
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,280
- We'll move onto the next mission.
 -  Okay.

879
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,880
- Before we get going,
 -  Okay.

880
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,320
- Question.
 -  we'll announce the next question.

881
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,580
Is it...

882
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,580
(The questions can change the outcomes.)

883
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:26,030
(What will their second question be?)

884
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:33,180
"You don't want to eat delicacies, do you?"

885
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,550
- No.
 -  No.

886
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,980
- We can't eat them?
 -  They cannot eat them.

887
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,720
- They made the question tricky.
 -  Yes, it's us!

888
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,250
- Yes!
 -  We can have delicacies, then.

889
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,630
We can eat!

890
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,680
- So...
 -  We can't eat if we're together.

891
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,780
This is your second question.

892
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:52,720
So the Yes Team will have a frugal meal.

893
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,760
And the No Team will have delicacies.

894
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,750
If you win this mission,

895
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,940
- the Member Swapping Card is yours.
 -  I see.

896
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:03,520
If the No Team wins,

897
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,850
you don't have to change members...

898
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,250
- and just enjoy the delicacies.
 -  Of course, we will.

899
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,950
- Or you can change members...
 -  Can we change just one member?

900
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,120
and receive a hint about who the No Man is. It's your choice.

901
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,280
- We don't have to change members.
 -  We should...

902
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,280
But we should find out who the No Man is.

903
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,580
- We should eat first.
 -  No way.

904
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,450
(When everyone says "Yes", Jae Seok says "No".)

905
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:22,450
What we need right now is food!

906
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:25,480
- Eating always comes first!
 -  We can eat first.

907
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,360
What's so important about finding the No Man?

908
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:30,980
- We should eat first.
 -  We're here to find the No Man.

909
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,620
- Gosh.
 -  What's our ultimate goal today?

910
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,430
- It's finding the No Man.
 -  No, it's eating!

911
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,280
- We're doing this to eat!
 -  Gosh.

912
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,520
- That's ridiculous!
 -  Let's go, then!

913
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,930
(Then we must win this mission.)

914
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:47,420
(Both teams are moving to their next destination.)

915
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,920
(How will both teams end up?)

916
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,790
So the No Man is among us.

917
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,990
- It feels weird.
 -  It does.

918
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,420
- It's not me.
 -  It's not me either.

919
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,480
We'll find out soon.

920
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,850
(Who among these 5 is the No Man?)

921
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,750
- Je Hoon.
 -  Are you usually competitive?

922
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,820
When you play games, do you tend to be well-mannered?

923
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,190
- Please tell us.
 -  I am well-mannered,

924
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:11,150
but I believe in playing fair to win.

925
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,150
Do you mean that...

926
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:16,080
you check to see if someone's cheating?

927
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,290
If you watch the Premier League games, each team has its style.

928
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:22,780
And our team tends to cheat a lot to win.

929
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,020
Like Diego Costa of Chelsea?

930
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,450
Right. That's right.

931
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:29,260
(Do you want me to play like Diego Costa?)

932
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,750
As Diego Costa of Chelsea used violence on an opponent player,

933
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:35,730
he received penalty for his wrongdoing.

934
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:38,080
He even pushed the player down...

935
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,490
when the opponent tried to stand up.

936
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:44,120
- Like Diego Costa of Chelsea?
 -  Right.

937
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,780
If Haha, Kwang Soo and I are in the same team,

938
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,050
- it's a given.
 -  You should cheat as well.

939
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,580
It's weird if we don't cheat.

940
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,420
A Ra also joined us a few times...

941
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,330
and she's not a fair player.

942
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:57,470
- Gosh.
 -  What are you talking about?

943
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,220
- I'm lost for words.
 -  She's definitely not.

944
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,880
- When you...
 -  I saw you cheating.

945
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,580
- My goodness.
 -  I know you cheated a lot.

946
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:06,500
- Right.
 -  A Ra is a pretty dirty player.

947
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,650
- We must win today.
 -  Okay.

948
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:11,020
We should use any means to win.

949
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,480
- We don't have to be gentle.
 -  He's right.

950
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,950
You can swear and even hit them when the camera isn't rolling.

951
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:18,430
You'd better be prepared to cheat in order to win today.

952
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,830
Let me explain the rules.

953
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:24,350
You should clear the "Road Mission Shows" and come...

954
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:26,850
- to the restaurant first to win.
 -  Okay.

955
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,090
The first mission is...

956
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,920
- jegichagi.
 -  It's jegichagi.

957
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,490
You should bring three passers-by...

958
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:37,140
and play a relay jegichagi.

959
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:40,590
- This is our first game.
 -  Okay, let's go!

960
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,380
Do you know how to play jegichagi?

961
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,700
Is anyone good at jegichagi?

962
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:48,190
Good. Come here.

963
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,420
(Jong Kook casts the first player.)

964
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,080
- Are you good at jegichagi?
 -  Jegichagi.

965
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,650
He said he's a good football player.

966
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:54,790
Come out.

967
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,120
- Come with us.
 -  It's okay.

968
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,550
This is the order that we should go by.

969
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,820
All right. Let's go for it.

970
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:03,550
- Get ready.
 -  In 1, 2 and 3.

971
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,190
- We can do it!
 -  We can do it!

972
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:08,190
(The winning team can take the advantageous position.)

973
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,330
Play it slowly.

974
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:12,250
(Mission starts.)

975
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:13,460
All right!

976
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:16,380
(Gary tosses the jegi to Sung Kyun.)

977
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,550
Good. Toss it higher.

978
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,620
(Gary tosses the jegi to Sung Kyun.)

979
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,660
(Pass!)

980
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:24,280
- Good! Go!
 -  Gosh, what happened?

981
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,860
(Ji Hyo is the last player.)

982
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,460
Gosh, what happened?

983
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,850
(They succeed in first try.)

984
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:36,020
We did it!

985
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,360
(Yes Team succeeds at the first game in 3 minutes.)

986
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,050
(Stunned)

987
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:42,190
We did it!

988
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,260
(Thank you so much.)

989
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,330
Let me go first. Do I pass this to him?

990
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:48,390
- That's it.
 -  Wait!

991
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:50,030
(A Ra misses the jegi.)

992
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,920
- A Ra, you can do it, right?
 -  Yes.

993
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,280
- Can you do this?
 -  Why don't you go last?

994
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,550
- Don't you want the delicacies?
 -  Look at this.

995
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,460
Do like this.

996
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,690
(Haha gives A Ra a tip.)

997
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:01,200
Toss it at this point.

998
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:03,590
- That's right.
 -  All right! Let's go!

999
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,320
Start.

1000
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,780
(They attempt again.)

1001
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,530
(If I do as Haha taught me, we can make it!)

1002
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,330
(Tossing)

1003
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:16,450
- A Ra!
 -  Mark my words!

1004
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:19,320
- Look at him!
 -  A Ra, please.

1005
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,530
Toss it like this.

1006
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,400
- Do not throw it.
 -  Try it.

1007
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,980
One, two... Kick this.

1008
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,280
(Kick it.)

1009
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,330
(She misses.)

1010
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:29,220
(This is so frustrating.)

1011
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,640
- Okay. That's enough.
 -  Try it again.

1012
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,930
- Will you please kick it like this?
 -  Why can't you do it?

1013
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,890
Don't kick it away.

1014
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:38,040
- Wait.
 -  Try again.

1015
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,410
You almost got it.

1016
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:40,520
- Let's change the order.
 -  Okay. You'll be the last.

1017
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,580
Let me go first.

1018
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,200
- Okay. I'll go last.
 -  Let's begin.

1019
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,480
- Hold on.
 -  Okay. Go.

1020
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,920
(They can't delay it any longer.)

1021
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,390
(They must succeed in order to get the Member Swapping Card.)

1022
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:51,020
(Mission starts.)

1023
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,090
- There you go.
 -  Good.

1024
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:54,550
- There you go.
 -  Good job.

1025
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:55,840
- That's it.
 -  Keep it up.

1026
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,030
Kick it with your right foot.

1027
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,680
(He saves the jegi from falling.)

1028
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,030
I got this.

1029
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,320
- There you go.
 -  Nice.

1030
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,600
I'll get it.

1031
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,280
- Good job.
 -  We're doing great.

1032
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,780
(A Ra has to kick it once to complete the mission.)

1033
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:10,650
(Will they succeed?)

1034
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:11,750
(Success)

1035
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:14,420
- You did it.
 -  Good job.

1036
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:17,990
(Yes Team completes the mission.)

1037
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,480
We did it.

1038
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,580
- We need to swap members.
 -  Hey.

1039
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:23,120
- We should thank the No Man.
 -  Thank you.

1040
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,350
The person is doing a great job.

1041
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,080
No Man is trying really hard.

1042
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,550
No Man must be hungry, too.

1043
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,150
- I see.
 -  No Man must be hungry, too.

1044
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:31,280
You know, everyone needs their own goal.

1045
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,520
Look. There's an elderly woman.

1046
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,720
- Where?
 -  Excuse me.

1047
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,970
- Excuse me, Ma'am.
 -  Excuse me.

1048
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:37,910
- Hello.
 -  Can you spare five minutes for us?

1049
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,380
- Do you have time?
 -  We will draw a picture.

1050
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,750
You just have to guess what we are drawing.

1051
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,120
- You just have to make a guess.
 -  In 30 seconds.

1052
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,190
Thank you.

1053
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,350
Thank you, Ma'am.

1054
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:46,620
Ma'am, do you know who we all are?

1055
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:47,720
- Do you know him?
 -  Hello.

1056
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,950
- Hello.
 -  I know you!

1057
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:51,350
- You're Kim Jong Kook.
 -  You're right.

1058
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:53,720
- I see you on TV all the time.
 -  Thank you.

1059
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,880
Do you know who he is?

1060
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,060
I don't remember.

1061
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,750
(Embarrassed)

1062
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,520
- He plays the role of a villain.
 -  Goodness.

1063
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,980
- Is he a singer?
 -  Maybe this will jog your memory.

1064
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,780
- "Goodness. Hello."
 -  "Hello."

1065
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,490
- "Nice to see you."
 -  "Nice to see you."

1066
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,660
- I remember now.
 -  Okay.

1067
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,190
How about him?

1068
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:11,160
(Does she know who Gary is?)

1069
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:15,170
(It's me, Gary.)

1070
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:16,650
It's Dary. Dary.

1071
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,030
He's not Dary.

1072
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:21,280
(Dary must sound more familiar to her.)

1073
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,820
She just called you "Dary".

1074
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,920
Dary.

1075
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,750
- I'm really good at this.
 -  Okay.

1076
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,160
- You can count on me.
 -  Okay.

1077
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,620
(Mission starts.)

1078
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,080
(Fork crane)

1079
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,150
- How do I draw that?
 -  Oh, my.

1080
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:35,480
Wouldn't this be too difficult for her?

1081
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,750
Look closely, Ma'am.

1082
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,130
This might be a bit difficult.

1083
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,380
(She has 30 seconds to get the right answer.)

1084
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,550
- This is difficult.
 -  Don't forget...

1085
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,560
to draw the crane.

1086
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,080
(What is this thing used for?)

1087
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,320
- Hold it tightly.
 -  Okay.

1088
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,950
- You need to hold on to it.
 -  Is it a bowl?

1089
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,060
Hold on. Let me do this.

1090
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,910
Just follow my lead.

1091
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,050
Jong Kook is good at drawing.

1092
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:55,190
- He is.
 -  This is difficult.

1093
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,600
It looks okay.

1094
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,320
Wow.

1095
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,150
(It's getting better with Jong Kook's lead.)

1096
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,830
- Please give us the answer.
 -  One.

1097
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:04,050
Please, tell us your answer.

1098
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:05,350
Ma'am, take a closer look.

1099
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,720
Do you know what this is?

1100
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,900
- Five, four.
 -  Don't feel pressured.

1101
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,520
- Four.
 -  Feel free to guess anything.

1102
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,150
- Three, two.
 -  Is it a fork crane?

1103
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,630
(Is it a fork crane?)

1104
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:15,660
Is it a fork crane?

1105
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:18,480
(She got it right.)

1106
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,480
- That's right.
 -  That's great, Ma'am.

1107
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,580
Ma'am, you're the best.

1108
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,050
(No Team completed their mission.)

1109
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:25,190
Thank you so much.

1110
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,860
(How is Yes Team doing in their second mission?)

1111
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,220
(Owl)

1112
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,040
- Okay, we can do this.
 -  All right. In 1, 2, 3.

1113
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,780
- Here we go.
 -  Loosen your grip.

1114
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,650
- Loosen your grip.
 -  Not that way.

1115
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:35,570
Loosen your grip.

1116
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:37,190
- What are we doing?
 -  You're doing it wrong.

1117
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:38,290
- Gosh.
 -  Stay still.

1118
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,280
It doesn't look right.

1119
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,650
- I don't think this looks right.
 -  This is not it.

1120
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:42,720
No, it's not.

1121
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,940
- Loosen your grip.
 -  This isn't right.

1122
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,150
- Why don't we finish here?
 -  Loosen your grip.

1123
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,550
Why won't you loosen your grip?

1124
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,470
- I can't finish here.
 -  Move it over here.

1125
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:51,120
- Move it over this side.
 -  Just skip this.

1126
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,280
- What are you doing?
 -  What are you drawing?

1127
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,420
(It's a fat owl.)

1128
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,460
Who's in charge?

1129
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,820
This is horrible.

1130
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,080
(I was trying to draw an owl,)

1131
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,950
(but what is this creature?)

1132
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:02,820
- What is that?
 -  Hold on.

1133
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,350
What is this?

1134
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:06,010
This looks weird.

1135
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,450
Can you tell what this is?

1136
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:09,190
- Here it is.
 -  Did I draw this?

1137
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,200
You did.

1138
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:14,280
(Can he figure out what this drawing is supposed to be?)

1139
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,690
- Is this our final drawing?
 -  What's your guess?

1140
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:16,760
It's a chick.

1141
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:18,380
- Wait.
 -  No.

1142
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,920
- Hold on.
 -  You spoke too soon.

1143
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,140
You have to answer when we count to three.

1144
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,200
Take your time and look at the drawing again.

1145
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:26,550
I understand why you said chick.

1146
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,350
- Wait.
 -  That looks scary.

1147
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:29,650
- What is your guess?
 -  One.

1148
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:30,820
- Two.
 -  King Kong.

1149
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,230
- King Kong.
 -  It's not King Kong.

1150
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:33,850
(They fail their mission.)

1151
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:35,180
- What's the answer?
 -  It's...

1152
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,350
- an owl.
 -  Sorry.

1153
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:37,760
- We're sorry.
 -  We apologise.

1154
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,060
(He is shocked.)

1155
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,540
- Let's ask them for help.
 -  Please help us.

1156
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,060
Excuse me.

1157
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,280
- Please come here.
 -  Maybe they'll get it.

1158
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,420
(She starts running.)

1159
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,030
- Please come here.
 -  Bring them over.

1160
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:48,550
Hello. We need some help for Running Man.

1161
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:50,180
Could you guess what we're drawing?

1162
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,250
- It's simple.
 -  Well...

1163
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,290
- Come on.
 -  It's too difficult.

1164
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,970
- Hello.
 -  Are you good at drawing?

1165
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,150
Please begin.

1166
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:58,860
(We want all the viewers to take a guess, too.)

1167
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:00,710
Okay.

1168
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:01,880
- Good.
 -  That's good.

1169
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,720
That's good. Let's stop here.

1170
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,420
- I'm sure she can do it.
 -  Okay!

1171
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:08,170
Please turn around.

1172
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:09,860
It's small, so you should come closer.

1173
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,220
- It is a bit small, isn't it?
 -  It's tiny.

1174
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:14,460
One, two, three.

1175
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:19,650
(Will Yes Team be able to complete this mission?)

1176
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:20,950
It's an anchovy.

1177
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,050
(Anchovy)

1178
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,120
(Correct)

1179
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,690
- You're right.
 -  It's an anchovy.

1180
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:26,330
- Wow.
 -  We did it.

1181
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:27,650
Well done.

1182
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:29,810
You completed all the Road Missions.

1183
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:30,980
This is the address of the restaurant.

1184
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,560
- We need to get there quickly.
 -  Hurry.

1185
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,320
- Okay.
 -  Hurry. Hurry.

1186
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,720
- Okay.
 -  Go. Go.

1187
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,850
- Let's go.
 -  Come on.

1188
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:38,060
(They need to get there before the other team does.)

1189
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:41,040
We have to either swap members or find the No Man.

1190
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,420
Let's think about finding the No Man after we eat.

1191
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,150
- You're right.
 -  I don't think we'll find him.

1192
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:47,850
We have to find the No Man.

1193
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:49,200
Is No Man really that important?

1194
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:52,650
Is finding the No Man still important?

1195
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:54,080
How should we swap members?

1196
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,840
Let's decide whom we should swap first.

1197
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,660
- Jong Kook, Sung Kyun.
 -  Yes.

1198
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,920
- I think Jong Kook is the No Man.
 -  I think so, too.

1199
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,620
Jae Seok could be the No Man, too.

1200
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,320
If it's either Sung Kyun or Jong Kook,

1201
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:10,220
we should leave them and us three should swap teams.

1202
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,980
If Sung Kyun or Jong Kook is the No Man, we have a 50 percent chance.

1203
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,090
It's pretty high.

1204
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:16,440
- We should go that way.
 -  Okay. Let's send...

1205
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,480
- three people to the other team.
 -  All right.

1206
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,920
- That's it.
 -  Okay.

1207
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,960
Okay. That's it.

1208
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,860
- This isn't goodbye forever.
 -  It's temporary.

1209
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,620
If the No Man joins the other team, will he be the one eating?

1210
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:29,050
- Yes, that's right.
 -  Of course.

1211
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:30,530
(Will the No Man be able to hide his identity?)

1212
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:38,280
- It's a big feast.
 -  Did we get here first?

1213
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,750
- Wow.
 -  We came first.

1214
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:40,920
Yes.

1215
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:41,980
(Yes Team won.)

1216
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:44,260
- We won.
 -  That was hard.

1217
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:45,420
It's a big feast.

1218
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:46,880
- Look at the food.
 -  What is that?

1219
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,620
- What is that?
 -  It's rice with soy sauce.

1220
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:49,950
It's barley rice.

1221
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:51,760
- Are they hiding here?
 -  That looks so cruel.

1222
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,140
Let's choose first.

1223
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:54,720
Let's choose who we will swap.

1224
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,620
- They will be leaving.
 -  Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1225
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:57,790
- We don't have another choice.
 -  Okay.

1226
00:43:58,390 --> 00:43:59,580
You can only put out rock or paper.

1227
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,280
(Haha signals everyone except Kwang Soo.)

1228
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,420
You can only put out rock or paper.

1229
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:03,800
It's rock or paper?

1230
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,130
I meant, paper or scissors.

1231
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:06,670
What are you doing?

1232
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:08,220
- Why are you doing this to me?
 -  What did I do?

1233
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,350
- That wasn't fair.
 -  Those punks.

1234
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:11,520
- What are you doing?
 -  That wasn't very fair.

1235
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,960
Okay. Let's do it.

1236
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,350
All right. Let's go.

1237
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:15,530
(Kwang Soo signals rock, and Haha signals paper.)

1238
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:19,980
(Whom will they listen to?)

1239
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:22,350
- Rock-paper-scissors!
 -  Rock-paper-scissors!

1240
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:23,550
(Kwang Soo will be swapped.)

1241
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:24,560
Yes.

1242
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:29,350
Did anybody see my signal? Did you just ignore me?

1243
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:30,650
(He wanted them to put out rock, but they just ignored him.)

1244
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:32,690
I can't believe you didn't put out rock.

1245
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:35,290
All right. You are leaving.

1246
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:36,750
- You're leaving.
 -  Okay.

1247
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:38,060
How should we choose the next person?

1248
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:40,220
Je Hoon, do you have any ideas?

1249
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,880
- All right.
 -  Wait. How will we choose?

1250
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,620
- The loser has to leave.
 -  Okay.

1251
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:44,890
- Okay. The loser will leave.
 -  Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1252
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:46,720
Rock-paper-scissors.

1253
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,950
(He signals rock to trick Seok Jin.)

1254
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:51,630
- Rock-paper-scissors!
 -  Rock-paper-scissors!

1255
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:54,880
(Seok Jin will be swapped, too.)

1256
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:55,890
(Okay.)

1257
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:59,230
(You tricked me again.)

1258
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,180
Did you guys plan this?

1259
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:03,060
Why are you looking at me?

1260
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,030
Let's only put out rock or scissors.

1261
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:06,880
- Only rock or scissors.
 -  Scissors?

1262
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,030
- Yes.
 -  Okay.

1263
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:09,930
- Rock-paper-scissors!
 -  Rock-paper-scissors!

1264
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,540
(What is this?)

1265
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:15,490
You cheater.

1266
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:17,850
(Hurrah)

1267
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:18,960
He's a cheater.

1268
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:22,330
- Je Hoon just cheated.
 -  Why? What happened?

1269
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:24,460
He told me to put out scissors.

1270
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:26,280
- He got you.
 -  Haha,

1271
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,460
he tricked me, too.

1272
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:29,520
(We did it.)

1273
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,880
This is great.

1274
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,230
This side is much better.

1275
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:34,520
- We're not sending No Man.
 -  We're not.

1276
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,360
- That's right.
 -  That was great.

1277
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:40,200
(Je Hoon signalled scissors to Haha, first.)

1278
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,320
(He puts on a poker face.)

1279
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,470
Only rock or scissors.

1280
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:45,020
(Then he signalled scissors to A Ra.)

1281
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:47,480
(After that, he put out rock and played them.)

1282
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,820
He's the best among all the actors I've met.

1283
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:51,140
No Man can be on your side.

1284
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:52,970
We're full of surprises today.

1285
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:55,360
I can't believe that Je Hoon did this.

1286
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:58,810
People like you cause dramas like "Signal" to happen in real life.

1287
00:45:58,810 --> 00:46:00,220
(Je Hoon played a traitor today.)

1288
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:01,390
I'm sorry.

1289
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,550
They're here already.

1290
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:04,780
(No Team finally arrives.)

1291
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:06,390
- You're late.
 -  You are.

1292
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:08,220
(You're one step late.)

1293
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,400
- It's nice to see you all.
 -  What delayed you?

1294
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,950
We already know who we want to swap.

1295
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:13,420
- Really?
 -  Yes.

1296
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:15,070
- Let's play black and white.
 -  Okay.

1297
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:16,280
- Are we choosing three people?
 -  Yes.

1298
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,730
- Black and white.
 -  White.

1299
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:19,980
Who's left?

1300
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,420
- Those 3 are leaving.
 -  Those 3 are staying.

1301
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,480
We are leaving.

1302
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,490
If the three of us swap teams...

1303
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:27,990
and we get to eat, it means that it's between...

1304
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:29,550
- the two of them.
 -  That's right.

1305
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:31,120
- We'll know for sure.
 -  It'll be one of them.

1306
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,920
- It'll narrow it down.
 -  We'll have a 50 percent chance.

1307
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,220
All right. Let's move.

1308
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:35,520
These three will join your team.

1309
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,840
- Are you joining us?
 -  Yes.

1310
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,750
(They swap team members.)

1311
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:40,350
- Who is the No Man?
 -  All right. Look.

1312
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:42,180
- Is the No Man on our team?
 -  It's the two of them, isn't it?

1313
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:43,820
We have the two candidates on our team.

1314
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:45,310
If your team gets the meal,

1315
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:47,380
either Jong Kook or Sung Kyun is the No Man.

1316
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:49,550
- We're close to figuring it out.
 -  That's amazing.

1317
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:50,920
- It's 1 of those 2.
 -  I'll give you the second question.

1318
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:55,340
All of you must answer yes to the question...

1319
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,540
"You don't want the feast, do you?"

1320
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,660
The team that doesn't get the meal will be penalised.

1321
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:01,280
Okay. Let's find out.

1322
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,920
(Is Jong Kook or Sung Kyun the No Man?)

1323
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,580
(Or is it someone else?)

1324
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:05,860
- The No Man is on that team.
 -  Oh, my!

1325
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,460
- Do we get to eat?
 -  It's one of those two.

1326
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:09,650
(Jong Kook's team will have the feast.)

1327
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:10,720
All right. Who's the No Man?

1328
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,980
- Who is it?
 -  It's not me.

1329
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:13,280
It's 1 of you 2.

1330
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,880
- Do we get to eat?
 -  I knew it.

1331
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,560
- Do we get to eat?
 -  I knew this would happen.

1332
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,930
(They seem depressed.)

1333
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:21,560
That's too bad.

1334
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:23,080
It's either Sung Kyun or Jong Kook.

1335
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,150
- Sung Kyun.
 -  Let's eat.

1336
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:25,460
Whatever.

1337
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:26,580
(Anyway, it's a feast!)

1338
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,630
- We did it!
 -  It's a feast!

1339
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:30,380
- Je Hoon guesses so well.
 -  He's so good.

1340
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,260
Who is it between the two?

1341
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:34,980
They're the two people that we predicted.

1342
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,830
Je Hoon is sharp.

1343
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:39,750
Je Hoon is thriving today.

1344
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:41,050
It's Je Hoon's day today.

1345
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:42,830
Je Hoon is amazing.

1346
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:45,450
- Can we eat now?
 -  It's a feast!

1347
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:47,250
- Thank you for the food.
 -  It has all the delicacies.

1348
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:48,630
Enjoy.

1349
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:52,750
(They are happy that they can say no.)

1350
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:54,630
I like something chewy.

1351
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,930
Eat the meat, too. Eat a lot.

1352
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,150
It's delicious.

1353
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:02,740
The beef is...

1354
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:04,330
authentic Korean beef.

1355
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:06,960
It's really nice.

1356
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,180
Try the raw beef, too.

1357
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:11,160
- It's delicious.
 -  I'm jealous.

1358
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:14,730
They look so pitiful.

1359
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:17,180
(The Yes Team looks so sad.)

1360
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:18,850
Look at this beauty.

1361
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:20,520
(Different situations under the same roof.)

1362
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:23,440
- But isn't this too much?
 -  What is?

1363
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,060
Isn't that life?

1364
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:29,020
- Gosh. Think in our shoes.
 -  Seok Jin.

1365
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:30,750
- What would you do?
 -  I am really sorry,

1366
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:33,510
but Je Hoon's the special guest. Why are you sitting in the middle?

1367
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:34,950
Why is that so important?

1368
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:36,080
- Why are you obsessed...
 -  The guest should be there.

1369
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,150
- about being in the centre?
 -  I just sat here unintentionally.

1370
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:42,450
- What's the big deal? You sit here.
 -  He always wants attention.

1371
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:44,850
- What's the big deal?
 -  That's great.

1372
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:48,350
- Now, it's balanced.
 -  Now, it's perfect.

1373
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:50,480
- How about Sung Kyun then?
 -  How about him?

1374
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,690
Sung Kyun is meant to stay there.

1375
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:55,550
- And why is that?
 -  His head looks small from there.

1376
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:57,080
- I must be crazy.
 -  Why?

1377
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,970
- I sat in the middle.
 -  Don't say that!

1378
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:00,280
(How could I?)

1379
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,920
- You are mad.
 -  Gosh...

1380
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,520
- He didn't even know.
 -  I must be mad.

1381
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,880
- He's an attention-seeker.
 -  Gosh, I didn't know.

1382
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,050
- What?
 -  You seek attention.

1383
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:10,580
- I am an attention-seeker?
 -  You want to be in the centre.

1384
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:13,020
- I want to be in the centre?
 -  He's a centre-seeker.

1385
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,320
Gosh...

1386
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,280
I'm a side-seeker.

1387
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,620
(He's a side-seeker.)

1388
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,420
So I am the centre-seeker.

1389
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:22,680
It's my first time being accused of such a thing.

1390
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:23,980
(Now, he is determined to find the No Man!)

1391
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:25,820
Let's go.

1392
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:27,310
- Let's go.
 -  Let's go!

1393
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:28,720
- Let's try it.
 -  We have to win.

1394
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,950
I love it. It's going as we planned, Je Hoon.

1395
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:34,320
We picked the two of you as the No Man suspects.

1396
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,820
- We thought it'd be one of you.
 -  Right.

1397
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:38,020
- We guessed it right.
 -  It's the first time...

1398
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:40,650
we narrowed the list to two candidates.

1399
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:42,020
(There's a 50 percent chance.)

1400
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:45,960
Then should I pretend not to know anything to make it extra fun?

1401
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:49,860
- To make it more fun?
 -  I have no idea who it is!

1402
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:54,630
If we are too quiet, does the producer talk to you through the walkie-talkie...

1403
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:57,320
- and tell you to talk more?
 -  By any chance,

1404
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,870
- Can you reenact that scene?
 -  The scene with the walkie-talkie?

1405
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:01,350
- Please.
 -  Right.

1406
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:04,230
(He attempts to communicate.)

1407
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:07,060
Detective.

1408
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:10,550
Yes, I am listening. Did you catch the suspect?

1409
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:11,820
(Reenactment of the breathtaking scene.)

1410
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:14,920
I caught the suspect.

1411
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,160
(Reenactment of the breathtaking scene.)

1412
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:20,220
Can you hear me?

1413
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:22,360
(He reenacts a scene from "Signal".)

1414
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:25,620
(They are lucky to witness Je Hoon's acting up-close.)

1415
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:27,190
Do you hear my voice?

1416
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,260
(Do you hear my voice?)

1417
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:30,490
Call him.

1418
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:33,760
Detective Lee Jae Han.

1419
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,680
(They get the chills.)

1420
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,920
Detective!

1421
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,540
Open the window. They're watching.

1422
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,820
Detective Yu!

1423
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:43,020
- He's talking to Detective Lee.
 -  We're watching "Signal"!

1424
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:45,130
- I am Park Hae Young.
 -  Lieutenant Park.

1425
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:47,430
Are you listening to me?

1426
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,420
- Yes, Detective. Where are you?
 -  They are so different.

1427
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,650
- Lieutenant Park.
 -  I want to hear it, too!

1428
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:54,030
I guess it's different there now.

1429
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:57,020
It must be better now, right?

1430
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:59,180
(He bets on his name...)

1431
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:02,080
I caught the suspect.

1432
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,720
(to catch the No Man.)

1433
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,020
- First of all...
 -  I loved that drama.

1434
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:08,960
- I am going crazy right now.
 -  We still love it.

1435
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:12,830
It's a basketball court.

1436
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:14,490
Oh my gosh.

1437
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:16,340
Oh my gosh.

1438
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:17,920
- We have to use our strength.
 -  I'm so weak.

1439
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,750
- It's all about your strength.
 -  I think we have to dangle.

1440
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,780
- Gosh...
 -  No way.

1441
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:23,980
This...

1442
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:27,330
- This doesn't...
 -  This doesn't make sense.

1443
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:29,580
You want us to do this?

1444
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:31,220
We can't even dangle.

1445
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:33,620
- Isn't this too unfair for us?
 -  What is it?

1446
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:35,120
- What's wrong?
 -  We have to dangle...

1447
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,050
- and make the opponent fall.
 -  It's that game!

1448
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:39,440
(Same mission, different reactions)

1449
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,520
- It's unfair for us.
 -  Gosh...

1450
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,830
- How can this be?
 -  Let's do this!

1451
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:46,850
- It's unfair for us.
 -  Why?

1452
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:50,620
It's not like we planned it. It just happened this way.

1453
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,130
Only one person can play, right?

1454
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:57,200
Seok Jin, I am sorry, but you're not the one we are afraid of.

1455
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,080
Why are you acting confidently?

1456
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,080
- It's just that we are a team.
 -  Gosh...

1457
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,750
- We're a team.
 -  You drive us crazy.

1458
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:03,980
When will I be this confident?

1459
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:06,260
You're unbelievable.

1460
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:10,220
Before we play the game, I'll reveal the last question.

1461
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:11,480
(The last question is revealed.)

1462
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,680
What will it be?

1463
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,890
(What will it be?)

1464
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:18,580
"Will you carry your opponent?"

1465
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:19,850
(Will you carry your opponent?)

1466
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:21,380
- To where?
 -  Our answer is no, right?

1467
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:23,060
Right.

1468
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:26,020
- We don't want to do it.
 -  After this game, you will...

1469
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:27,780
move to the last venue.

1470
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:29,900
And it's about 1km away from here.

1471
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,380
- We have to walk 1km?
 -  We have to carry them?

1472
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:33,520
- We will piggyback them?
 -  And walk 1km?

1473
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,120
The team with No Man will be...

1474
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,580
- exempted.
 -  We won't have to carry them.

1475
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:38,780
- The Yes Team...
 -  We have to win.

1476
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:41,520
will carry the No Team and walk 1km.

1477
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,680
But how will you find the No Man without switching members?

1478
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,690
- That's true.
 -  We won't find him then.

1479
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:49,080
We won't find him and we will be carried.

1480
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,060
- I won't switch.
 -  How can we walk 1km?

1481
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:54,220
Whenever the feet of the person on your back touch the ground,

1482
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:56,530
a mole will be drawn on your face.

1483
00:52:57,530 --> 00:52:58,630
Yes. Great.

1484
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,150
- We will win for sure.
 -  We will get at least 10 moles.

1485
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:04,020
- How can we do this?
 -  They will turn into leopards.

1486
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:07,420
How could you add more ugliness to the already ugly face?

1487
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:08,760
What will I do?

1488
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:13,020
- We have to win and get carried.
 -  Let's talk...

1489
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,760
- after we win.
 -  Let's talk after we win.

1490
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:17,980
One of you is the No Man.

1491
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:19,680
- They are in one team.
 -  So who is it?

1492
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:23,760
- Only two are left.
 -  Honestly, we really don't know.

1493
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,180
- I am sorry, but...
 -  We'll know if we separate them.

1494
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:28,950
But it's really not me.

1495
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:31,080
We're leaning towards him.

1496
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,950
- Isn't it too unfair for us?
 -  It's too unfair.

1497
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:35,520
- It's very unfair.
 -  Are you trying to kill us all?

1498
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,080
- It's...
 -  It doesn't make sense.

1499
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:40,280
This mission is one-on-one hanging leg wrestling.

1500
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,880
- Hanging leg wrestling?
 -  How does it work?

1501
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,680
Each team will determine the match order.

1502
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,850
Then each team member will come out and choose a box each.

1503
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:50,520
They will wear what they get from the box around their feet.

1504
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:53,430
And then they'll leg wrestle while hanging.

1505
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:56,380
- Let's begin.
 -  Let's do it!

1506
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:58,220
We have to win this.

1507
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:59,360
Song Ji Hyo!

1508
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:01,460
Seok Jin.

1509
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:02,930
Please announce it.

1510
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:04,460
Go A Ra.

1511
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,760
- Lee Je Hoon.
 -  That's good!

1512
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:08,390
All right!

1513
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,380
You each get to choose one.

1514
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,080
- I got green onions.
 -  That's a nice one.

1515
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,650
That's nice.

1516
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,290
What's that?

1517
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:17,380
What's this?

1518
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:18,520
(Ji Hyo picks inflated rubber gloves.)

1519
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:19,790
I got green onions.

1520
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,610
But I have to be able to hang up there.

1521
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:26,260
(Gravity is his biggest enemy.)

1522
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,720
(Seok Jin versus Ji Hyo)

1523
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,160
We don't know what will happen.

1524
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:32,420
- Here we go.
 -  Okay.

1525
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:34,150
(It's the match of the century.)

1526
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:35,420
Ready.

1527
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:36,650
(Seok Jin's green onion versus Ji Hyo's rubber gloves)

1528
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:38,930
Start.

1529
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:41,740
That's it, that's it.

1530
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:43,550
(Ji Hyo climbs up Seok Jin.)

1531
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:46,060
(Ji Hyo attacks Seok Jin first.)

1532
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:48,290
(She hits Seok Jin's face.)

1533
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:51,960
(Let me borrow your face for a while, Seok Jin.)

1534
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:55,190
- Oh, no.
 -  Oh, dear.

1535
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:57,090
What should he do?

1536
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,650
- Drop his glasses!
 -  She's amazing.

1537
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:03,280
- She's great.
 -  Grab him.

1538
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,120
- Hey...
 -  Grab Seok Jin's fingers.

1539
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,920
Attack his fingers, Ji Hyo.

1540
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,680
(But the game is not over yet.)

1541
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,950
(I can't give up like this.)

1542
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:14,990
(Will Seok Jin begin his counterattack?)

1543
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:17,720
(Fails)

1544
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,780
(Flapping)

1545
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:20,960
(He falls.)

1546
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:25,320
(Ji Hyo wins.)

1547
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:28,620
Ji Hyo. Ji Hyo. Ji Hyo, you are...

1548
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:30,160
You are really impressive.

1549
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:32,120
Gosh, I am so upset!

1550
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,150
- I'm so upset.
 -  I'm sorry, Seok Jin.

1551
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:36,230
(I'm sorry, but I was being easy on you.)

1552
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:39,930
(Je Hoon and A Ra choose their boxes.)

1553
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:42,420
- Is it a flower?
 -  What is it?

1554
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:44,120
It's a flower!

1555
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,980
- It's a flower.
 -  Give it to me.

1556
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,620
You could tickle his face.

1557
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:48,960
I got...

1558
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:52,930
It's a feather. That would be even more ticklish.

1559
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,790
- That's...
 -  Please bring your items.

1560
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:01,180
(Je Hoon and A Ra get ready.)

1561
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:03,650
(Their appearances...)

1562
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:05,180
(brighten up the mood of the game.)

1563
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:06,420
Isn't this the last round?

1564
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,850
- All right.
 -  This is the last round.

1565
00:56:07,850 --> 00:56:09,520
(But behind this beautiful match is a dreadful penalty.)

1566
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,690
Ready.

1567
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,050
Set.

1568
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:15,820
(It will be a tough match.)

1569
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:16,890
Start.

1570
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:19,720
- Are you all right?
 -  A Ra.

1571
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:20,980
They are too close.

1572
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:23,130
(Are you okay, A Ra?)

1573
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,620
- You have to do it.
 -  A Ra, you must win.

1574
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:28,350
- Tickle him.
 -  Wrap him.

1575
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:30,420
- Wrap him.
 -  You have to win.

1576
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:33,130
(They hesitate to battle and exchange eye contact instead.)

1577
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:35,420
Je Hoon, you can't win like that.

1578
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:37,780
- Come on!
 -  You can even kick him.

1579
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:40,180
- Je Hoon, I am sorry.
 -  A Ra, wrap his waist.

1580
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:42,730
(I'm sorry, Je Hoon.)

1581
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:45,790
(She kicks Je Hoon lightly.)

1582
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:49,230
(She just touches him lightly.)

1583
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:56,360
(This is strange. This game is supposed to be...)

1584
00:56:57,090 --> 00:56:59,220
(a merciless war.)

1585
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:01,020
No. You are amazing.

1586
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:03,720
- Wrap your legs around him.
 -  Grab him.

1587
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,050
I am sorry, Je Hoon.

1588
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:07,820
- That's it, A Ra.
 -  I don't know where to attack.

1589
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:09,550
You have to wrap your legs around his waist to win.

1590
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:11,530
(She falls.)

1591
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,150
Yes! I knew it!

1592
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:17,320
(What happened? Did Je Hoon do something?)

1593
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:19,120
He's perfect. He's handsome and strong.

1594
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,490
- It's tough to stay hanging.
 -  It's tough for a girl.

1595
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:27,060
(Currently, No Team is winning by 1 point.)

1596
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:33,120
(Sung Kyun versus Jae Seok)

1597
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,250
Ready.

1598
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:36,300
Get set, go!

1599
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:39,380
- He's getting right into it.
 -  Look at him go.

1600
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:40,880
(Jae Seok surprises Sung Kyun.)

1601
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,210
Raise them higher!

1602
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:44,730
(He rests his legs on Sung Kyun's bar.)

1603
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:47,760
- It didn't work.
 -  I don't think this is right.

1604
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:49,980
(It didn't work.)

1605
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:52,720
- It didn't work.
 -  What am I doing?

1606
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,620
- Hold on.
 -  This is unpredictable.

1607
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:56,040
Sung Kyun, you might win.

1608
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,820
- Jae Seok, bite him.
 -  Raise them the other way.

1609
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:00,780
- Where?
 -  Go the other way.

1610
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:02,220
Lift yourself with your arms.

1611
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:04,250
(Biting)

1612
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:05,900
Did you bite him?

1613
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:08,390
- He bit him.
 -  He bit his foot.

1614
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:14,750
(Nobody thought it would be an easy match,)

1615
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:17,920
(but they didn't think it would be this extreme.)

1616
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,990
Good job. Way to go.

1617
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:22,680
Poke his bottom.

1618
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,470
(Jong Kook tells Sung Kyun to poke Jae Seok's bottom.)

1619
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:28,780
(He pokes Jae Seok's bottom.)

1620
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:30,120
(Sung Kyun attacks back.)

1621
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,460
Look at him.

1622
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:32,730
(Shaking)

1623
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:36,480
(Let's send him to the other side of the world!)

1624
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,920
(Please do not try this at home.)

1625
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,540
- Isn't that too deep?
 -  Goodness.

1626
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:42,650
- That's too much.
 -  Gosh.

1627
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:43,880
Isn't that too deep?

1628
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:47,280
(Jae Seok succumbs to it and drops.)

1629
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,740
What was that about?

1630
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:50,220
- That wasn't expected.
 -  Hey.

1631
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:52,480
- What was that about?
 -  That was a good match.

1632
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,360
- Hey, Sung Kyun.
 -  We won.

1633
00:58:55,090 --> 00:58:56,870
How could you do this?

1634
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:59,220
Jae Seok, that was close to a colonoscopy.

1635
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:01,650
His hand disappeared completely.

1636
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:02,920
- Hey.
 -  Did you see what he did?

1637
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,570
Come on, Sung Kyun.

1638
00:59:04,570 --> 00:59:06,920
Did you find any polyps in there?

1639
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:08,790
- Ji Hyo.
 -  There weren't any.

1640
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,680
- That's good to hear.
 -  Did you get a colonoscopy?

1641
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,320
- Jae Seok.
 -  Congratulations.

1642
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,820
He really poked me hard.

1643
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:17,460
Sung Kyun is enthusiastic, but he doesn't understand comedy.

1644
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:20,930
- Is that right?
 -  He didn't have to poke that deep.

1645
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:23,680
- It was this much.
 -  I thought he was an anaconda.

1646
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,410
- Even his arm...
 -  Hold on.

1647
00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:27,280
- He's a cobra.
 -  This is a first.

1648
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,450
Ji Hyo, I'm leaving it at that because I'm on television.

1649
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:32,980
- Oh, gosh.
 -  This is part of the act.

1650
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:34,300
(Was he always this competitive?)

1651
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:36,440
One of you is the No Man.

1652
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:38,650
Who is it? Tell us who the No Man is.

1653
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:40,350
It's not me.

1654
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:42,360
- We are leaning towards him.
 -  We are.

1655
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:44,950
- It's not me.
 -  We never know.

1656
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:46,820
(Was he trying so hard because he's the No Man?)

1657
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:48,110
Is this allowed?

1658
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:50,680
- You can't do anything about it.
 -  You should have worn a diaper.

1659
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:53,460
Why would I wear a diaper? He went too far.

1660
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:55,630
I'm sorry. I apologise.

1661
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:59,080
- So the final score is 3 to 1.
 -  That's right.

1662
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:01,810
- We can do a match worth 2 points.
 -  Let's do it for 10 points.

1663
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:04,930
Hold on. You were the only one who lost on your team.

1664
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:07,970
- Why are you showing off?
 -  So?

1665
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:10,580
- Don't boss us around.
 -  I'm on this side.

1666
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:13,150
- This is my team.
 -  I am at a loss for words.

1667
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:15,580
We can give you up to 100 points, but you need to bet on something.

1668
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:17,030
- Did you say 100 points?
 -  Yes.

1669
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:18,750
You need to give up something.

1670
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:20,720
- Doesn't that hurt your pride?
 -  We don't have to do this.

1671
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:21,930
I won't do it!

1672
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:24,620
Don't do it, then! Forget it.

1673
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:26,150
There's no reason for us to do this.

1674
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:27,920
I do want to win,

1675
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,160
so let's do a match worth 400 points.

1676
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,530
I won't play dirty any more.

1677
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:34,030
If I lose, I'll admit my failure.

1678
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:36,220
If we lose, we'll give you 2.5 trillion points.

1679
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:37,250
(We're willing to put 2.5 trillion points on the line.)

1680
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:38,810
You're getting on my nerves.

1681
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:41,050
- You're getting on my nerves.
 -  You can take 2.5 trillion points.

1682
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:43,180
If we lose, we'll even give you a piggy back ride home.

1683
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:44,500
All right.

1684
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:45,620
I'll go.

1685
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:48,350
(Jae Seok will compete in this crucial match.)

1686
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:50,880
- Give him a gastroscopy this time.
 -  It's worth 10 trillion points.

1687
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,150
(We meet again.)

1688
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:54,270
- In 1, 2, 3.
 -  Yes!

1689
01:00:54,270 --> 01:00:57,920
(Jong Kook versus Jae Seok)

1690
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,530
Ready, go!

1691
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:05,810
Give him a face massage.

1692
01:01:05,810 --> 01:01:07,990
- Use your feet.
 -  You've done this before.

1693
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:09,920
Lucky you, Jae Seok.

1694
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,050
(You've come again, my dear customer.)

1695
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:12,590
- Hey.
 -  This is humiliating.

1696
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:14,460
Gosh.

1697
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:16,650
(Struggling)

1698
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:18,020
Your feet stink.

1699
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:19,220
(Jong Kook's feet stink.)

1700
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:20,520
(Don't my feet smell nice?)

1701
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:21,710
You're so cute.

1702
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:28,190
- Go, Jae Seok!
 -  Go, Jae Seok!

1703
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:32,370
He's good at giving a meridian massage.

1704
01:01:32,370 --> 01:01:33,520
(Jong Kook starts rubbing Jae Seok's face again.)

1705
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:34,860
This isn't right.

1706
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:36,430
(Dropping)

1707
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:38,850
That's our win.

1708
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:40,180
(You're welcome to challenge me again.)

1709
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:43,300
- We wanted to give you more points.
 -  Couldn't you do better?

1710
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:44,980
It was right on the table.

1711
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:46,080
(That was fun.)

1712
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:47,160
Gosh.

1713
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:51,250
So the final score is 2,500,000,000,405 to 1.

1714
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:53,120
(The No Team takes the win.)

1715
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:56,710
- 2.5 trillion to...
 -  It's 2,500,000,000,405 to 1.

1716
01:01:56,710 --> 01:01:57,950
What did you say?

1717
01:01:57,950 --> 01:01:59,720
(The score went from 3 to 1 to 2.5 trillion to 1.)

1718
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,830
- That's a big difference.
 -  It is.

1719
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,720
This is how you become penniless.

1720
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:05,960
(This is why you shouldn't gamble.)

1721
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:08,120
- You need to run away.
 -  Life turns itself around...

1722
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:10,280
- in a split second.
 -  You shouldn't invest everything.

1723
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:11,830
(This game taught them a life lesson.)

1724
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:15,350
- The No Team is the winner.
 -  I'm exhausted.

1725
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:16,630
- Yes.
 -  Great.

1726
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:20,520
- Oh, gosh.
 -  Yes Men, think about this.

1727
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,760
- What?
 -  Let's rip their name tags.

1728
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:25,370
What if we rip Sung Kyun's...

1729
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:27,880
- and find out that he's the No Man.
 -  Then, we have to take the penalty.

1730
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,650
- Exactly.
 -  Why would we risk that chance?

1731
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:31,170
Then, give us Jong Kook.

1732
01:02:31,170 --> 01:02:34,220
- What if it's not him?
 -  What if he's the No Man?

1733
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:35,950
- What do you mean?
 -  What do you want us to do?

1734
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:37,250
- Who'll give him a piggy back ride?
 -  To be honest,

1735
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:39,780
I'd rather not separate from him.

1736
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:41,850
- I want to be on his side.
 -  Did we just play...

1737
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:44,630
that game to narrow down the No Man?

1738
01:02:45,530 --> 01:02:47,650
- She's upset.
 -  This is too...

1739
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:48,850
She's upset.

1740
01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:50,850
- This is unfair.
 -  Go over to them.

1741
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,820
- We need a different game.
 -  Complain for us.

1742
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:55,080
We have to separate the No Man candidates.

1743
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:57,580
- A win won't do.
 -  That's right, A Ra.

1744
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:59,220
- At this stage,
 -  She's upset.

1745
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:01,120
don't we need to talk this over in a quiet space?

1746
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,280
It's fine if we have to give them a piggy back ride.

1747
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,080
- But we'll get mud-bombed.
 -  We have to find the No Man.

1748
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:07,950
- You guys are impossible!
 -  We'll get mud-bombed.

1749
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,260
- Can't you tell?
 -  Then, let's not do the piggy back.

1750
01:03:10,730 --> 01:03:12,530
Let's just take the mud bomb.

1751
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:15,150
- Seriously?
 -  You take it on your own!

1752
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:16,790
Do you think that's fair?

1753
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:19,110
- This is not a joke!
 -  This isn't fair.

1754
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:21,380
- I have a bad back.
 -  We should have done this before.

1755
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:23,450
- It's better to take the mud bomb.
 -  Listen.

1756
01:03:23,450 --> 01:03:25,180
- He has a disc problem.
 -  Don't put yourself through this.

1757
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:26,920
- I can't do this.
 -  We'll be giving piggy back rides,

1758
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:29,430
- but we'll all be mud-bombed.
 -  One thing is for certain.

1759
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:30,980
- You're wrong.
 -  Why should we be punished?

1760
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:32,520
We won so why should we be punished?

1761
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,780
You know what the best scenario is? If we do neither...

1762
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:36,420
- of the punishments.
 -  Exactly.

1763
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:37,820
- Why would we...
 -  We can just choose.

1764
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:39,650
- It's a 50 percent chance.
 -  That's right.

1765
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:42,780
Hold on. Sir, what are you doing in this group?

1766
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:46,050
- What's your role in the group?
 -  I'm a member of this team.

1767
01:03:46,050 --> 01:03:47,250
(I'm a member of this team.)

1768
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:49,780
- I guess you didn't know.
 -  Sir.

1769
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:52,200
So, No Man Team.

1770
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,920
- Are you switching members?
 -  No.

1771
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,550
(The No Team is not switching their members.)

1772
01:03:55,550 --> 01:03:57,120
Give us one person.

1773
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:58,580
- Who?
 -  I'm a Yes Man,

1774
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:01,350
but I'm going to avoid the piggy back ride.

1775
01:04:01,350 --> 01:04:03,390
Can't we find the No Man in the next match?

1776
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:07,980
(Sung Kyun or Jong Kook)

1777
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:11,280
(Which one of them is the No Man?)

1778
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,980
(Find the No Man.)

1779
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:15,260
(Jong Kook is the strongest candidate.)

1780
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:17,700
- Am I heavy?
 -  It's okay.

1781
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:19,820
- I'll hold you close.
 -  Oh, dear.

1782
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:21,550
(If the feet of the person on the back touches the ground,)

1783
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:22,930
(they get to draw a dot.)

1784
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:24,080
(His feet touches the ground.)

1785
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:25,630
My feet touched the ground.

1786
01:04:25,630 --> 01:04:27,250
(Kwang Soo's legs are too long.)

1787
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:29,650
Wait, you only took five steps.

1788
01:04:29,650 --> 01:04:31,250
- No!
 -  You took five steps.

1789
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:32,360
(He draws five dots.)

1790
01:04:32,690 --> 01:04:34,080
- We're almost there.
 -  It's here, right?

1791
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:35,780
Hold on. In 1, 2, 3.

1792
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:36,930
(Here we go.)

1793
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,120
We're here.

1794
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:41,450
(A Ra brings Je Hoon across the finish line.)

1795
01:04:41,450 --> 01:04:42,650
You did well.

1796
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:45,930
(I did it.)

1797
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:50,780
(Jae Seok takes Sung Kyun for a piggy back ride.)

1798
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:53,280
(He looks like a son carrying his father.)

1799
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,330
I passed.

1800
01:04:54,930 --> 01:04:58,090
(All five of them cleared the mission.)

1801
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,120
This is the day.

1802
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:02,730
(They'll make their final choice.)

1803
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:05,260
This is the final moment.

1804
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:07,250
- There's 10 of you, right?
 -  Yes.

1805
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:10,080
If the majority doesn't guess the right No Man,

1806
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:12,320
- Yes Men will be punished.
 -  everyone except the No Man...

1807
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:13,580
will be mud-bombed.

1808
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:16,020
But if the majority guesses the right No Man,

1809
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:17,850
then only the No Man will be mud-bombed.

1810
01:05:17,850 --> 01:05:19,980
The No Man won't write their own name then, right?

1811
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:21,480
- That's right.
 -  Yes.

1812
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:23,050
(Sung Kyun and Jong Kook are the likely candidates.)

1813
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:24,320
- Right, Sung Kyun?
 -  Yes.

1814
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,450
Are you going to write your name?

1815
01:05:25,450 --> 01:05:27,360
I'm going to write Jong Kook's name.

1816
01:05:29,290 --> 01:05:30,330
(Blinking)

1817
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,220
(Staring)

1818
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:34,080
It's you, Sung Kyun.

1819
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:36,120
(Sung Kyun is surprised while Jong Kook remains calm.)

1820
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:38,050
- They'll pick each other.
 -  He's acting.

1821
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:39,580
Shouldn't we ask them to say a few words?

1822
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:41,180
Let's hear their closing arguments.

1823
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:42,920
- Let me make my closing argument.
 -  Good.

1824
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:44,660
If I was the No Man,

1825
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:47,860
I would have said it wasn't me.

1826
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:51,120
But since I'm not the No Man, I'm saying I'm not.

1827
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:53,850
- I follow what you are saying.
 -  Can I have a pen?

1828
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:56,180
I understand what you are saying but your face...

1829
01:05:56,180 --> 01:05:57,920
- says otherwise.
 -  I'm not convinced with that face.

1830
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,360
I'll bet...

1831
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,700
- my...
 -  Don't bet on your family.

1832
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:04,460
- We got in enough trouble for that.
 -  Have you?

1833
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:07,630
That's how certain I am.

1834
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:10,030
You humiliated me and invaded my private space.

1835
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:11,590
It's your turn.

1836
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:13,080
- Me?
 -  Yes.

1837
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:15,160
I'm sure you already know, but it's not me.

1838
01:06:15,790 --> 01:06:17,950
- Why isn't it you?
 -  Because it's not me.

1839
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:19,020
Goodness.

1840
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:21,080
- It's not me.
 -  Okay, that's enough.

1841
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:23,520
I'll bet on my right arm,

1842
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:25,830
that humiliated Jae Seok and his bottom, that it isn't me.

1843
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:28,320
(Even after hearing the closing arguments,)

1844
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:32,790
(it's still difficult to predict the No Man's identity.)

1845
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:35,450
- Make the right choice.
 -  We made up our mind.

1846
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:36,750
Have you made up your mind?

1847
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:38,900
Then, we'll have each of you go in the booth...

1848
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:41,990
and cast your vote. Flash your paper to the camera.

1849
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:46,460
(If they make the wrong choice, they'll be mud-bombed.)

1850
01:06:47,530 --> 01:06:50,430
(Who's the No Man between these two?)

1851
01:06:53,090 --> 01:06:58,490
(Kwang Soo is the first to vote. Who will he choose?)

1852
01:06:59,690 --> 01:07:00,860
(He chooses Jong Kook.)

1853
01:07:01,290 --> 01:07:04,510
Whenever he takes on these roles,

1854
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:06,640
he says things like, "It's not me."

1855
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,350
- Because it's not me.
 -  Gosh.

1856
01:07:08,350 --> 01:07:09,880
- It's not me.
 -  That's enough.

1857
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:11,830
He always gets these roles.

1858
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,430
So I'll pick him.

1859
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:17,880
(Je Hoon also chooses Jong Kook.)

1860
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:19,590
I had a hunch from the beginning.

1861
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:23,620
I had a feeling it was Sung Kyun near the end.

1862
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:25,610
In the closing arguments,

1863
01:07:25,610 --> 01:07:28,030
I was convinced that Sung Kyun is the No Man.

1864
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:30,350
So I chose Sung Kyun.

1865
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:31,560
(A Ra chooses Sung Kyun.)

1866
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:34,990
(Jong Kook and Sung Kyun each earned 2 votes so far.)

1867
01:07:35,830 --> 01:07:37,750
(Sung Kyun stares at A Ra.)

1868
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:39,250
- Why are you looking at me?
 -  You didn't pick me, did you?

1869
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:40,630
- Sorry?
 -  I'm not the No Man.

1870
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:43,360
I am warning you. I am not the No Man.

1871
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:44,890
I'm really not.

1872
01:07:45,490 --> 01:07:46,930
I hope you didn't make the wrong choice.

1873
01:07:47,390 --> 01:07:49,960
- He's so sincere.
 -  Why didn't you say that before?

1874
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:53,150
I told you that I wasn't the No Man.

1875
01:07:53,150 --> 01:07:54,850
- What?
 -  I made up my mind.

1876
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:56,160
Sung Kyun, you're amazing.

1877
01:07:56,630 --> 01:07:57,630
(He laughs in disbelief.)

1878
01:07:58,430 --> 01:08:00,880
- Sung Kyun is...
 -  Gosh.

1879
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,180
- Who is the No Man then?
 -  Goodness.

1880
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:03,390
(They both deny that they're the No Man.)

1881
01:08:04,030 --> 01:08:05,670
- We'll see.
 -  Gosh.

1882
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:07,220
- I am so confused now.
 -  He's driving me crazy.

1883
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:09,160
(They still don't have a clue.)

1884
01:08:10,730 --> 01:08:12,760
I knew it was Sung Kyun from the beginning.

1885
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:20,220
They really confused me towards the end.

1886
01:08:20,220 --> 01:08:23,230
(The remaining members cast their votes.)

1887
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:26,990
(Sung Kyun and Jong Kook also cast their votes.)

1888
01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:28,780
(The voting is complete.)

1889
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:33,620
- I'll announce the results now.
 -  Please.

1890
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:37,060
(I really don't want to be mud-bombed.)

1891
01:08:37,930 --> 01:08:39,350
Sung Kyun got six votes.

1892
01:08:39,350 --> 01:08:41,350
(Sung Kyun received 6 votes.)

1893
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:42,420
(Yelling)

1894
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:44,480
And Jong Kook got four votes.

1895
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:45,670
- Really?
 -  Goodness!

1896
01:08:45,670 --> 01:08:48,680
(Sung Kyung received more than half of the votes.)

1897
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:50,680
I told you so many times that I am not the No Man!

1898
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:52,030
Are you really not the No Man?

1899
01:08:52,030 --> 01:08:54,180
(I can't believe this.)

1900
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:55,490
- Gosh.
 -  All right!

1901
01:08:55,490 --> 01:08:56,680
He's still pretending he's not the No Man.

1902
01:08:56,680 --> 01:09:00,350
- I'm really not.
 -  If Sung Kyun is the No Man...

1903
01:09:00,350 --> 01:09:01,820
- Is it Jong Kook?
 -  It's Jong Kook.

1904
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:04,660
If Sung Kyun is the No Man, he will receive the penalty alone.

1905
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:06,990
- Did you vote for Jong Kook?
 -  If Sung Kyun is not the No Man,

1906
01:09:06,990 --> 01:09:09,450
everyone except Jong Kook will receive the penalty.

1907
01:09:09,450 --> 01:09:10,630
(Who will be the ones to get mud-bombed?)

1908
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:12,780
(It's time to find out who the No Man is.)

1909
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:14,740
- We're all going to get mud-bombed.
 -  No way.

1910
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:16,080
- One.
 -  I am sorry, Sung Kyun!

1911
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,150
Please!

1912
01:09:17,150 --> 01:09:18,230
(I'm so sorry.)

1913
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,160
Two.

1914
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,430
(Please...)

1915
01:09:24,930 --> 01:09:26,250
Three!

1916
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:28,080
(Who will get the mud bomb?)

1917
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:30,450
(Wow!)

1918
01:09:30,450 --> 01:09:32,860
(That's unbelievable.)

1919
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:39,020
(The mud pours endlessly.)

1920
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:44,650
(Everyone except Jong Kook receives the penalty.)

1921
01:09:44,650 --> 01:09:46,860
(The No Man is Jong Kook!)

1922
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:48,520
(I told you that it wasn't me.)

1923
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:49,580
It's pouring down.

1924
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:51,340
(Where have all the pretty and handsome people gone?)

1925
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:52,490
- Gosh.
 -  I can't believe this.

1926
01:09:52,490 --> 01:09:55,000
- You fools!
 -  How could you not notice?

1927
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,690
(They're all filthy.)

1928
01:09:57,790 --> 01:09:59,220
- Towards the end...
 -  No.

1929
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:01,840
- I changed my mind at the end.
 -  Why did you stammer?

1930
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:04,210
- Why didn't you listen to me?
 -  You weren't convincing.

1931
01:10:04,210 --> 01:10:06,150
- You should've been more clear.
 -  This is ridiculous.

1932
01:10:06,150 --> 01:10:07,580
- You guys...
 -  Why weren't you more clear?

1933
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:08,680
Jong Kook said...

1934
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:09,950
It was hard for me to keep a straight face.

1935
01:10:09,950 --> 01:10:11,360
Towards the end, Jong Kook...

1936
01:10:11,930 --> 01:10:15,120
looked at Sung Kyun in disbelief. That's when I fell for it.

1937
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:17,230
Me too. That's why I chose Sung Kyun.

1938
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,430
Sung Kyun, you're amazing.

1939
01:10:20,830 --> 01:10:22,530
(I can't believe you, Jong Kook.)

1940
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:25,130
(Jong Kook was able to deceive everyone.)

1941
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,990
The No Man is Jong Kook.

1942
01:10:28,990 --> 01:10:30,760
(Jong Kook is the No Man.)

1943
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:34,040
It was really hard for me to deceive all of you.

1944
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:36,870
- It was a hard role to play.
 -  I can't believe this.

1945
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:38,920
- It wasn't easy.
 -  I thought it was him.

1946
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:40,260
I was going to write Jong Kook's name.

1947
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:41,850
You guys kept convincing me that it wasn't him.

1948
01:10:41,850 --> 01:10:43,880
- I was fooled at the last minute.
 -  Me too.

1949
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:46,090
I voted for Sung Kyun because his closing argument was weak.

1950
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:49,570
It was my first time to appear on Running Man.

1951
01:10:49,570 --> 01:10:51,060
This is payback.

1952
01:10:51,530 --> 01:10:52,660
(This is payback.)

1953
01:10:53,590 --> 01:10:55,650
(He's angry.)

1954
01:10:55,650 --> 01:10:57,420
- Jong Kook is really angry.
 -  You're in trouble now.

1955
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:58,930
- He's really mad.
 -  Are you okay?

1956
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:01,220
If I deserved this, I'd have nothing to say.

1957
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:02,430
Why did you do that?

1958
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:05,260
- I can't understand him.
 -  Why did you do this to me?

1959
01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:08,100
I've had my fair share of being on variety shows,

1960
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:10,540
but I don't get why Kwang Soo just did what he did.

1961
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:12,090
Look at me. What is this?

1962
01:11:12,730 --> 01:11:13,850
What is this?

1963
01:11:13,850 --> 01:11:14,990
(You shouldn't have done that, Kwang Soo.)

1964
01:11:14,990 --> 01:11:16,080
What was that for?

1965
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,250
It was fun though.

1966
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:19,320
I'm getting angry.

1967
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:23,690
(Thank You, A Ra, Je Hoon and Sung Kyun for joining us.)

1968
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:26,850
(The Battle for the Centre has begun.)

1969
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:28,320
(7 guests join the show to support the members.)

1970
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,450
What happened?

1971
01:11:29,450 --> 01:11:31,500
(In Young, Stephanie, Jin Young, Hyeon Gyeong, Zico, Su Jin, Bo Ah)

1972
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:32,830
Standby.

1973
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:34,820
Don't even think about being in the centre.

1974
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:35,880
What are you doing?

1975
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:37,350
Are you going to appear on television by yourself?

1976
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:38,630
(The one who sits at the centre shall gain everything.)

1977
01:11:39,230 --> 01:11:40,580
Do you want to be the king?

1978
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:42,180
(It's a fierce competition.)

1979
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:43,680
- Ouch, that hurt.
 -  I need to be in the spotlight.

1980
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:44,900
(They fight for screen time.)

1981
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:46,150
It'd be a good idea to change it.

1982
01:11:46,150 --> 01:11:47,260
(Who will win the Battle for the Centre?)

1983
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:53,830
(Next Week's Special is Battle for the Centre.)
