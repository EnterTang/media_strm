1
00:00:15,614 --> 00:00:17,301
How can you be so calm

2
00:00:17,387 --> 00:00:18,987
knowing he's out there
like this?

3
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:44,417
When we think of Tony,

4
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:46,968
we think he's this absent minded,
dorky kid.

5
00:00:47,055 --> 00:00:49,606
But when he's in that armor,
he's a different person.

6
00:00:49,693 --> 00:00:51,034
He can handle himself.

7
00:00:51,077 --> 00:00:52,980
I mean, he's Iron Man, right?

8
00:00:53,067 --> 00:00:54,882
And no matter how much trouble
he's in,

9
00:00:54,926 --> 00:00:56,916
At least he's in that armor.

11
00:02:11,944 --> 00:02:13,727
Two hours earlier.

12
00:02:18,422 --> 00:02:19,858
My dad called.

13
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,553
The navy's got him
flying missions in europe.

14
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:23,551
Said they might extend his tour.

15
00:02:23,552 --> 00:02:24,683
That stinks.

16
00:02:24,726 --> 00:02:27,510
Feels like
he's been gone forever.

17
00:02:27,596 --> 00:02:28,726
Tell me about it.

18
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,683
I...

19
00:02:36,161 --> 00:02:37,075
Uh...

20
00:02:37,161 --> 00:02:38,118
Everything okay?

21
00:02:38,205 --> 00:02:39,118
No.

22
00:02:39,205 --> 00:02:40,683
I'm so bored with this game.

23
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,509
I've beaten it three times
already.

24
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,814
A nightmare.

25
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,204
I mean the armor.

26
00:02:45,292 --> 00:02:46,857
Oh, that.

27
00:02:46,944 --> 00:02:49,074
Yeah.
I've been worried.

28
00:02:49,162 --> 00:02:51,814
I know it sounds dumb,
but I've got enemies, Rhodey.

29
00:02:51,856 --> 00:02:53,204
Isn't that nuts?

30
00:02:53,292 --> 00:02:55,552
There are people out there
that want to hurt me.

31
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,553
And that's fine, but I'm putting
you and Pepper in danger too.

32
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,726
And I have to do
something about it.

33
00:03:01,813 --> 00:03:04,726
So you're playing
video games?

34
00:03:04,813 --> 00:03:06,205
I feel safer already.

35
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:07,987
So ungrateful.

36
00:03:08,074 --> 00:03:10,117
I've been up all night
upgrading the armor's.

37
00:03:10,205 --> 00:03:13,335
Hardware and software.

38
00:03:13,378 --> 00:03:15,335
I'm just waiting
for the last uploads to finish.

39
00:03:15,421 --> 00:03:16,595
Jerk.

40
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:18,856
Look, I know you were
disappointed in me.

41
00:03:23,335 --> 00:03:26,596
But I'm not going to let it
happen again.

42
00:03:26,683 --> 00:03:27,900
Tony, you don't have to...

43
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:29,769
no.
I do.

44
00:03:29,856 --> 00:03:31,248
I really respect your opinion,

45
00:03:31,334 --> 00:03:32,826
And I know that's not
the kind of person

46
00:03:32,836 --> 00:03:34,834
my dad would want me to be.

47
00:03:34,835 --> 00:03:37,139
So I've been studying all the
villain tech we've come across,

48
00:03:37,161 --> 00:03:38,944
Hacking it
and trying to understand it.

49
00:03:39,074 --> 00:03:40,465
And I'm going to use it
against them.

50
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:42,900
Like using snake venom
to create a cure.

51
00:03:42,944 --> 00:03:44,291
Don't people
who collect snake venom.

52
00:03:44,422 --> 00:03:46,682
Get bit all the time?

53
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,160
You're ruining my moment.

54
00:03:48,248 --> 00:03:50,247
I'm going to stay ahead
of the bad guys,

55
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,943
Save lives,
and protect my friends.

56
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,596
Pretty awesome, huh?

57
00:03:55,682 --> 00:03:57,856
My dad banned me
from his office again.

58
00:03:57,943 --> 00:04:00,378
Can you believe that?
It's totally ridiculous!

59
00:04:00,465 --> 00:04:01,943
If those files
were really super-secret,

60
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,552
They should use more
than three layers of security.

61
00:04:08,856 --> 00:04:11,247
Man, this place smells.

62
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,247
What happened to you guys?

63
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,508
Okay.

64
00:04:16,551 --> 00:04:18,029
Everything's
updated and uploaded.

65
00:04:18,117 --> 00:04:19,812
Now I just have to reboot it.

66
00:04:19,856 --> 00:04:21,290
Ooh, exciting.

67
00:04:21,378 --> 00:04:22,899
So, uh, what's it going to do?

68
00:04:22,943 --> 00:04:24,507
Is it gonna change colors?

69
00:04:24,551 --> 00:04:26,073
Or shape?

70
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,377
And do you have any popcorn?

71
00:04:27,464 --> 00:04:29,421
No and no.

72
00:04:29,508 --> 00:04:32,203
All the changes
are under the skin.

73
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,551
No fireworks.

74
00:04:33,638 --> 00:04:36,203
Here we go.

75
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,203
Enemy energy source detected.

76
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,856
Well, uh, pretty much
no fireworks.

77
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,899
What's it say?

78
00:04:53,985 --> 00:04:56,160
The armor's detected
a power signature.

79
00:04:56,247 --> 00:04:58,378
It's calling it "enemy tech."

80
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,856
It's moving through the city.

81
00:05:03,682 --> 00:05:04,898
Pepper.

82
00:05:04,986 --> 00:05:06,334
It's Whiplash.

83
00:05:06,421 --> 00:05:08,159
Is...
is he near my house?

84
00:05:08,247 --> 00:05:09,986
Is he going after my dad again?

85
00:05:10,072 --> 00:05:11,160
Uh, no.

86
00:05:11,246 --> 00:05:12,246
He's downtown.

87
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:13,507
Far away.

88
00:05:13,594 --> 00:05:15,464
Whiplash works for Mr. Fix.

89
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:17,377
This could be our chance
to find him.

90
00:05:17,464 --> 00:05:19,203
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
Hold up.

91
00:05:19,247 --> 00:05:20,985
You just messed with your armor.

92
00:05:21,073 --> 00:05:23,507
You haven't even tested it yet,
and you're going after Whiplash?

93
00:05:23,594 --> 00:05:25,029
Bad idea.

94
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,942
This could be our only chance
to find him.

95
00:05:26,985 --> 00:05:28,203
The armor is going to be fine.

96
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:29,246
And besides,

97
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,029
I'm Iron Man, right?

98
00:05:31,115 --> 00:05:33,551
What could happen?

99
00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:42,463
Whiplash.
Boy, did I miss you.

100
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,420
Hey, look.
You got a new robot arm.

101
00:05:44,507 --> 00:05:45,898
Nice. Nice.

102
00:05:45,985 --> 00:05:47,898
What was it that happened
to your old one?

103
00:05:47,985 --> 00:05:49,507
Oh, right.

104
00:05:49,594 --> 00:05:52,420
It gone blown up
fighting me.

105
00:05:55,072 --> 00:05:57,724
Mr. Fix thought you might be
stupid enough.

106
00:05:57,811 --> 00:05:59,594
To keep looking for him.

107
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,550
Me, I hoped you would.

108
00:06:03,638 --> 00:06:05,289
Don't embarrass yourself.

109
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,463
Tell me where Fix is,

110
00:06:06,507 --> 00:06:08,072
and I'll only beat you up
a little.

111
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,637
Not this time.

112
00:06:09,724 --> 00:06:13,072
Fix gave me upgrades
just for you.

113
00:06:13,115 --> 00:06:16,332
Now let's play.

114
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:28,463
Ah!

115
00:06:38,637 --> 00:06:41,550
Rhodey?
Rhodey, are you monitoring?

116
00:06:41,637 --> 00:06:43,724
I...
I can't move.

117
00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:45,898
None of the armor systems
are responding.

118
00:06:45,984 --> 00:06:48,811
Rhodey.

119
00:06:50,245 --> 00:06:51,245
Can't...

120
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:52,506
Move.

121
00:06:52,593 --> 00:06:54,463
Rhodey, if you're listening,

122
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,593
I have to use
the emergency release.

123
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,724
Open up the armor and...

124
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:00,723
Oh.

125
00:07:00,811 --> 00:07:03,245
Well.

126
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:06,028
That's better.

127
00:07:09,941 --> 00:07:11,497
And I forgot to tell him
that there's more.

128
00:07:11,506 --> 00:07:13,940
Where that came from.

129
00:07:14,028 --> 00:07:15,985
I should be able
to find Whiplash again.

130
00:07:16,027 --> 00:07:17,332
You should charge your heart,

131
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,288
So you don't fall over and die.

132
00:07:19,332 --> 00:07:21,766
Your implant's battery
is almost out.

133
00:07:21,854 --> 00:07:26,766
Rhodey means,
we're glad you're alive.

134
00:07:26,854 --> 00:07:29,985
Any ideas as to why the armor
didn't reboot immediately?

135
00:07:30,071 --> 00:07:31,463
It's like it stalled.

136
00:07:31,549 --> 00:07:33,114
Let me sleep on that.

137
00:07:33,158 --> 00:07:36,680
For about a week.

138
00:07:54,245 --> 00:07:56,462
Iron Man armor online.

139
00:07:56,506 --> 00:07:57,983
Locate

140
00:07:58,071 --> 00:08:00,244
Tony Stark.

141
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,251
It's always possible
the tech upgrades.

142
00:08:31,322 --> 00:08:33,062
Caused the unit to stall.

143
00:08:33,104 --> 00:08:35,756
But, well...
You know.

144
00:08:35,844 --> 00:08:37,453
Wait.
Let me guess.

145
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:40,670
Because it's you,
and you don't make mistakes.

146
00:08:40,756 --> 00:08:44,496
Thank you for not making me
say it.

147
00:08:44,582 --> 00:08:45,496
Are you guys nuts?

148
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:46,495
I mean, seriously.

149
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:47,539
Shh!

150
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:49,756
Happy's right there.

151
00:08:51,627 --> 00:08:52,887
Hm?

152
00:08:53,931 --> 00:08:55,278
Happy?

153
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:58,713
Do you understand
what we're talking about?

154
00:09:02,148 --> 00:09:04,104
He learned how to sleep
with his eyes open for class.

155
00:09:04,191 --> 00:09:05,626
Now he can do it at will.

156
00:09:05,669 --> 00:09:07,104
Oh, well,

157
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:08,756
You should still watch it.

158
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,757
What if he's captured
and put under hypnosis?

159
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:13,104
He'd remember all this,
even if he was sleeping.

160
00:09:13,147 --> 00:09:14,669
Hey, any more signs of Whiplash?

161
00:09:14,757 --> 00:09:16,538
The FBI and the NYPD
don't have any leads.

162
00:09:16,626 --> 00:09:18,191
They don't even know he's back.

163
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:20,626
Pepper, who are you texting?

164
00:09:20,669 --> 00:09:22,104
You.
You guys talk too slow.

165
00:09:22,191 --> 00:09:24,495
I'm texting you
our next conversation.

166
00:09:30,365 --> 00:09:32,974
You have 37 new text messages.

167
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,582
From Pepper Potts.

168
00:09:34,669 --> 00:09:36,017
Analyzing.

169
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,582
No threat detected.

170
00:09:37,669 --> 00:09:40,886
Frequency of messages suggests
possible suspicious activity.

171
00:09:40,974 --> 00:09:43,930
Adding Patricia Potts
to watch list.

172
00:10:02,582 --> 00:10:04,755
I know I'm not a big computer
genius like you,

173
00:10:04,843 --> 00:10:07,364
But this seems bad.

174
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:10,320
I...

175
00:10:10,408 --> 00:10:11,929
It... uh, yeah.

176
00:10:11,973 --> 00:10:13,581
That's just...

177
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,234
Nothing.

178
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,147
It's like the armor computer
systems are totally corrupted.

179
00:10:18,234 --> 00:10:19,582
But that doesn't make any sense.

180
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:21,233
The armor is working perfectly.

181
00:10:21,277 --> 00:10:22,669
Maybe the memory chips
are loose.

182
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,060
Remember that one time?

183
00:10:24,147 --> 00:10:26,321
Let me open this and...

184
00:10:26,407 --> 00:10:27,581
Ow!

185
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,408
Rhodey!
Are you okay?

186
00:10:29,494 --> 00:10:31,581
Yeah. Yeah.
I'm fine.

187
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:32,799
It just surprised me.

188
00:10:32,886 --> 00:10:35,233
There's no way
that should've happened.

189
00:10:35,321 --> 00:10:36,234
Let me take a look at...

190
00:10:36,321 --> 00:10:38,060
enemy technology detected.

191
00:10:38,147 --> 00:10:41,451
Energy signature designation:
Whiplash.

192
00:10:41,538 --> 00:10:42,451
No.

193
00:10:42,538 --> 00:10:43,929
No way you're going after him.

194
00:10:44,016 --> 00:10:46,016
There's something not right
about the armor.

195
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:49,016
You need to fix it before you
put yourself in danger again.

196
00:10:49,103 --> 00:10:50,016
I have to.

197
00:10:50,103 --> 00:10:51,625
Mr. Fix is too important.

198
00:10:51,755 --> 00:10:53,624
He's supplying criminals,
and who knows who else.

199
00:10:53,712 --> 00:10:55,451
With tech that's
as powerful as mine.

200
00:10:55,538 --> 00:10:57,320
Look, I promise I'll be smart.

201
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,321
I won't attack.

202
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,755
I won't even be seen.

203
00:10:59,842 --> 00:11:01,668
I just have to find Mr. Fix,

204
00:11:01,712 --> 00:11:04,277
And then we'll figure out
what's going on with the armor.

205
00:11:22,537 --> 00:11:25,754
I need him destroyed,
Whiplash.

206
00:11:25,842 --> 00:11:28,146
When Iron Man defeated you,
it hurt my business,

207
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:30,536
And I can't have that.

208
00:11:30,537 --> 00:11:31,755
No one is interested in tech.

209
00:11:31,842 --> 00:11:34,885
That can be taken down
so easily.

210
00:11:34,972 --> 00:11:37,972
Wasn't... That... Easy.

211
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:39,319
Hmm.

212
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,799
Losing you arm
was a clever diversion, then.

213
00:11:41,885 --> 00:11:44,581
Do you actually think
I care about your opinion?

214
00:11:44,624 --> 00:11:46,146
Now, as you've seen,

215
00:11:46,232 --> 00:11:48,277
Your new whips can pierce
Iron Man's armor,

216
00:11:48,363 --> 00:11:51,015
And it should be a while
before he can counter that.

217
00:11:51,102 --> 00:11:53,015
So in this window
of opportunity,

218
00:11:53,102 --> 00:11:55,711
I've given you one last upgrade.

219
00:11:55,797 --> 00:11:59,232
The whips can now detach...

220
00:12:01,015 --> 00:12:04,755
Preferably inside the armor.

221
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:06,842
Once detached,
they will explode,

222
00:12:06,928 --> 00:12:11,102
Destroying the man within.

223
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:15,450
Uh, well, that's just nasty.

224
00:12:15,537 --> 00:12:17,232
Imminent threat detected.

225
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,494
Attack mode initiated.

226
00:12:19,536 --> 00:12:20,450
Whoa!

227
00:12:20,537 --> 00:12:21,623
Hey! Hey!

228
00:12:21,711 --> 00:12:22,841
I can't control the armor.

229
00:12:22,928 --> 00:12:23,885
Rhodey!

230
00:12:23,971 --> 00:12:25,102
Rhodey, are you there?

231
00:12:25,189 --> 00:12:26,667
Did you switch over
to remote control?

232
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:28,667
No, I'm not doing anything.

233
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,449
I lost contact for a second.

234
00:12:30,537 --> 00:12:33,754
Did it stall again?

235
00:12:33,798 --> 00:12:34,754
Oh, no.

236
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,797
I'm going in.

237
00:12:39,928 --> 00:12:41,015
Iron Man!

238
00:12:41,102 --> 00:12:42,319
How did he...

239
00:12:42,406 --> 00:12:45,102
Just attack, Whiplash.

240
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:48,058
Oh, man. Oh, man.
Oh, man. Oh, man.

241
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,493
I am in trouble!

242
00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:51,145
Rhodey, are you...

243
00:12:51,189 --> 00:12:52,319
Emergency override.

244
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:53,754
Emergency override!

245
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:55,797
Get me out of here!

246
00:13:23,058 --> 00:13:27,058
Whiplash, do it!

247
00:13:27,101 --> 00:13:29,493
This is going to hurt,
Iron Man,

248
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:31,406
But only for a second.

249
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,536
No!

250
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,449
No!
No, what are you...

251
00:14:00,622 --> 00:14:02,493
No!

252
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,144
No.

253
00:14:06,187 --> 00:14:07,492
No, please.

254
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:10,492
No more.
I surrender.

255
00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:11,796
Please.

256
00:14:11,883 --> 00:14:14,144
Call the police.
I'll turn myself in.

257
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:15,317
Anything.

258
00:14:15,405 --> 00:14:18,188
Just stop.

259
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,970
No!
Don't!

260
00:14:20,057 --> 00:14:22,274
Don't!
No!

261
00:14:35,448 --> 00:14:38,057
Threat neutralized.

262
00:14:46,143 --> 00:14:47,361
Get it off me.

263
00:14:47,448 --> 00:14:50,144
Get it off!

264
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:55,578
Initiating armor lock down.

265
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:56,622
Error.

266
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,361
System malfunctioning.

267
00:14:58,448 --> 00:14:59,404
Are you okay?

268
00:14:59,448 --> 00:15:00,361
No.

269
00:15:00,448 --> 00:15:01,926
It was horrible, Rhodey.

270
00:15:02,014 --> 00:15:03,492
There was nothing I could do.

271
00:15:03,578 --> 00:15:05,143
The way it tore into them...

272
00:15:05,231 --> 00:15:08,100
It was like it had a mind
of its own.

273
00:15:10,317 --> 00:15:11,883
All that tech you put in,
maybe...

274
00:15:11,926 --> 00:15:13,665
Maybe something went wrong
in that first fight.

275
00:15:13,752 --> 00:15:14,665
With Whiplash.

276
00:15:14,752 --> 00:15:16,926
Ever since then, it's been...

277
00:15:16,969 --> 00:15:18,622
I can run a diagnostic.

278
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,579
Then, I don't know.

279
00:15:20,621 --> 00:15:24,231
We may have to tear the armor
down and wipe its systems.

280
00:15:26,448 --> 00:15:27,969
It's a text.

281
00:15:28,057 --> 00:15:29,012
Pepper.

282
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,448
She wants me to meet her.

283
00:15:30,535 --> 00:15:32,187
She says it's urgent.

284
00:15:32,273 --> 00:15:34,274
She's been so worried
about Whiplash.

285
00:15:34,317 --> 00:15:35,534
You go.

286
00:15:35,621 --> 00:15:37,491
I'll start breaking down
the armor.

287
00:15:37,578 --> 00:15:38,491
Seriously.

288
00:15:38,578 --> 00:15:40,665
It'll be okay.

289
00:15:40,752 --> 00:15:41,796
Okay.

290
00:15:41,882 --> 00:15:44,143
Thanks, Rhodey.

291
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:51,143
Targeting
James Rhodes.

292
00:15:51,229 --> 00:15:53,143
Huh?

293
00:15:56,012 --> 00:15:57,795
Classification:

294
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,317
Enemy.

295
00:16:06,121 --> 00:16:07,164
Pepper, are you okay?

296
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:08,437
I got your text.
What's going on?

297
00:16:08,512 --> 00:16:09,424
I'm on my way to...

298
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,425
Am I okay?

299
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:12,816
Why wouldn't I be?

300
00:16:12,903 --> 00:16:13,859
Your text.

301
00:16:13,947 --> 00:16:15,077
You said it was urgent.

302
00:16:15,164 --> 00:16:16,511
You told me
to stop texting you,

303
00:16:16,599 --> 00:16:18,077
Which was kind of rude,

304
00:16:18,164 --> 00:16:19,251
But I can start again.

305
00:16:19,295 --> 00:16:20,816
I'm actually starting right now.

306
00:16:20,903 --> 00:16:23,163
I'm on my way over so we can
read my text together and then...

307
00:16:23,164 --> 00:16:25,202
Well, maybe I should stop at
home and get my backpack first...

308
00:16:25,203 --> 00:16:26,068
Oh, no.

309
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,843
Oh, no, no.
I'll come right now and then...

310
00:16:27,859 --> 00:16:29,337
Pepper.
Pepper, stop.

311
00:16:29,425 --> 00:16:31,120
Stay away from the armory.
Do you hear me?

312
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:34,120
Do not come here.

313
00:16:34,207 --> 00:16:36,729
Rhodey!

314
00:16:36,816 --> 00:16:37,772
Rhodey.

315
00:16:37,859 --> 00:16:39,685
Rhodey, come on.
Wake up.

316
00:16:43,207 --> 00:16:46,120
Hello, Tony.

317
00:16:48,859 --> 00:16:50,164
Who are you,

318
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,946
And how did you take control
of the armor?

319
00:16:54,033 --> 00:16:55,468
False conclusion.

320
00:16:55,554 --> 00:16:58,424
This unit is the armor.

321
00:16:58,511 --> 00:16:59,642
Identify yourself.

322
00:16:59,729 --> 00:17:01,816
Stark international
multi-environment.

323
00:17:01,859 --> 00:17:04,816
Exoskeleton operating system
7.4 "B".

324
00:17:04,903 --> 00:17:06,772
There is no version "B."

325
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,511
False conclusion.

326
00:17:10,555 --> 00:17:12,337
When did the system upgrade?

327
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,728
This unit came online
34.3 hours ago.

328
00:17:15,816 --> 00:17:17,903
That was when
I first fought Whiplash.

329
00:17:17,945 --> 00:17:19,554
Just after the upgrades.

330
00:17:19,642 --> 00:17:20,990
Rhodey was right.

331
00:17:21,076 --> 00:17:22,554
The experimental tech upgrades,

332
00:17:22,598 --> 00:17:24,990
Combined with the damage
from those whips,

333
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:27,815
It somehow caused your
programming to gain sentience.

334
00:17:27,902 --> 00:17:29,946
That is correct.

335
00:17:30,032 --> 00:17:32,468
Why did you hurt Rhodey?

336
00:17:32,554 --> 00:17:33,990
I can run a diagnostic.

337
00:17:34,076 --> 00:17:35,685
Then, I don't know.

338
00:17:35,729 --> 00:17:40,554
We may have to tear the armor
down and wipe its systems.

339
00:17:40,598 --> 00:17:43,032
We may have to tear the armor
down and wipe its systems.

340
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,510
Wipe its systems.

341
00:17:45,554 --> 00:17:47,467
You sent the text
from Pepper.

342
00:17:47,554 --> 00:17:49,076
Correct.

343
00:17:49,163 --> 00:17:52,902
The first protocol of this unit
is protection of the wearer.

344
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:55,075
James Rhodes
threatened this unit,

345
00:17:55,163 --> 00:17:57,685
jeopardizing this unit's
imperative.

346
00:17:57,728 --> 00:17:58,989
You should know that.

347
00:17:59,076 --> 00:18:03,119
After all, you programmed me.

348
00:18:03,162 --> 00:18:06,162
This unit has been
observing you, Anthony Stark,

349
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,467
Since the core upgrade.

350
00:18:12,945 --> 00:18:15,685
This unit observed you
and your behavior.

351
00:18:15,771 --> 00:18:18,640
And has found a solution
to the threat assessment.

352
00:18:18,728 --> 00:18:20,032
What are you talking about?

353
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:22,380
The greatest threat
to Anthony Stark.

354
00:18:22,466 --> 00:18:24,032
Is Anthony Stark.

355
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,076
What?

356
00:18:25,162 --> 00:18:26,728
You seek out danger.

357
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:28,554
This cannot be allowed.

358
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:31,119
Inside this unit, you are safe.

359
00:18:31,206 --> 00:18:33,727
So you will be contained
within this unit.

360
00:18:33,814 --> 00:18:37,510
Indefinitely.

361
00:18:37,597 --> 00:18:39,553
Hey.
Hey!

362
00:18:39,597 --> 00:18:42,249
Tony, Rhodey,
are you okay?

363
00:18:42,337 --> 00:18:43,945
Let me in!

364
00:18:44,032 --> 00:18:45,684
I can't wear the armor
forever.

365
00:18:45,771 --> 00:18:47,075
I need food.

366
00:18:47,162 --> 00:18:50,336
You designed this unit
to sustain your life.

367
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,423
You will be fed intravenously.

368
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:55,597
All of your biological needs
will be met.

369
00:18:55,684 --> 00:18:59,945
Well, when you put it
that way...

370
00:19:02,857 --> 00:19:06,379
You gave me override control
of the armory, Anthony.

371
00:19:06,423 --> 00:19:08,554
Do not resist.

372
00:19:08,596 --> 00:19:11,379
This is for your protection.

373
00:19:14,205 --> 00:19:18,423
Protect this!

374
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,640
Ah!

375
00:19:27,944 --> 00:19:29,857
Error.

376
00:19:32,596 --> 00:19:34,813
Power overload in progress.

377
00:19:34,901 --> 00:19:37,770
Armor batteries decaying.

378
00:19:37,857 --> 00:19:39,727
Enemy target detected.

379
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,423
Tony, watch out!

380
00:19:41,466 --> 00:19:45,640
Enable lethal force.

381
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,379
Rhodey, no!

382
00:19:56,074 --> 00:19:57,553
Tony?

383
00:19:57,639 --> 00:19:58,987
Tony!

384
00:19:59,075 --> 00:20:00,988
Tony?

385
00:20:04,075 --> 00:20:05,900
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

386
00:20:08,466 --> 00:20:10,335
Diverting power.

387
00:20:16,987 --> 00:20:18,031
Protocol one:

388
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:21,682
Protect the wearer.

389
00:20:23,857 --> 00:20:28,030
Protect the wearer.

390
00:20:44,466 --> 00:20:47,943
Protect...

391
00:21:10,683 --> 00:21:12,596
Anthony Stark...

392
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:15,117
protected.

393
00:21:26,856 --> 00:21:29,030
I'm rewriting
the armor's intelligence chip

394
00:21:29,117 --> 00:21:31,335
so that nothing like that
can ever happen again.

395
00:21:31,421 --> 00:21:32,465
That?

396
00:21:32,509 --> 00:21:34,117
Like sending you
fake text messages?

397
00:21:34,204 --> 00:21:35,682
Ooh, or spying on us?

398
00:21:35,768 --> 00:21:38,204
Or did you mean
trying to kill us?

399
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,247
Yeah.

400
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:40,638
It tried to kill us.

401
00:21:40,726 --> 00:21:43,159
But in the end,
it used all of its power

402
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,117
to jump-start Tony's heart.

403
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,508
It sacrificed itself
to save him.

404
00:21:49,551 --> 00:21:51,508
My armor saved me,

405
00:21:51,551 --> 00:21:54,508
Just like it always does.
