1
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:14,260
you know coming into today we had the trend line break we had the trend

2
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:19,840
channel line over shoot a couple days ago and then a trend line break that

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,310
makes me looking for a higher lower lower load to buy the first part of the

4
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:29,110
day was a big doji far enough room for a scalpel to yesterday's closed in the

5
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:35,559
moving average I was looking for a good failed breakout this is a breakout

6
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:39,430
pullback short I didn't take it because I thought that there's a pretty good

7
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:43,540
chance we were going to have a trend reversal this is a good buy it came on

8
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:48,370
report when I had reports like that I usually wait to see if there's

9
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:53,290
tremendous slippage on the report and five or ten seconds later the market

10
00:00:53,290 --> 00:01:01,420
ticker to about and I mentioned that it was probably okay to get it and and it

11
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:07,030
was a decent lon there's a possibility of this was a low to breakout pullback

12
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:12,490
you know the Bears at the breakout and this is a two-legged pull back but I

13
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,999
thought the up momentum was strong enough that it was more likely going to

14
00:01:15,999 --> 00:01:22,149
be followed by more buying there was a tu hi tu with the moving average here in

15
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:28,030
general it's better the top of the bars above the moving average but you know so

16
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:32,979
let's not ideal but it was okay because of the channel nature there's a risk of

17
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:38,439
a third push down but if there's if it's a bull trend day if it turns into a bull

18
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:43,359
trend day you just get this you just get on the high too and nothing else the

19
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:48,579
market took out the double top and then ran every bar had a low at or above the

20
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:54,159
low prior bar for about 20 bars which they repeatedly is a by climax it's

21
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,069
unsustainable and usually the correction that comes from it is a lot deeper and

22
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:04,469
lasts a lot longer than anyone would expect but sometimes you just get to

23
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:10,660
sideways Corrections oh it's a test of yesterday's high I mentioned that on the

24
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:16,209
60 minute on the 60 minute it was also the third test of the trading range I so

25
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:21,640
that might be it for the day on the market broke the bull trend line pull

26
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,840
down and a channel I usually don't buy first break outs of

27
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,510
channels because they also often fail and again a double tot you have the

28
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:36,010
trend line break and a double top which can be a trend reversal but because of

29
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,670
all the sideways action I thought it was more likely that the market would have a

30
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:45,940
two-legged side with erection and then try to go up again now it's starting to

31
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:51,459
the channel down and that's bad for the Bulls we had three pushes down in a

32
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:58,629
channel and just a for ticked all on or five taped all on rehearsal bar to me I

33
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:03,099
don't like to buy the first break out of a channel especially if the setup

34
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:12,040
doesn't look very good and in the market went up to the outside down and then it

35
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:18,970
had all the cascading magnets the low of first a double top and the low of the

36
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,810
first attempt to sell off then the low of the second attempt to sell off than

37
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,099
the low of the trading range then the break-even stops then on the swing low

38
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:33,069
than the low today and the market just proceeded to take out every single woman

39
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:38,349
up this is a two-legged wedge a two-legged test in the moving average

40
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:43,690
here's the first leg up second leg third leg I did have an order to go short

41
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:51,579
below this high and instead I got two small doji so I pulled my order because

42
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:57,190
it was too much risk in my mind of Bob wire but it turned out to be a great

43
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:05,669
trade for those who took it now we have three pushes down 123 on and also this

44
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:11,769
tested below on that first attempt to sell off on but again it's kind of a

45
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:17,889
small bar relative to everything else I did place in order to go on about it but

46
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:26,530
didn't get filled again the market went down just as it did here and here the

47
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:32,770
Bears are strong we're going near the bottom of the channel to me that is not

48
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,770
a good long setup and again the market left out

49
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:43,400
tied down outside down and a break up below something usually has at least a

50
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:49,009
second leg down so I was not interested in buying above that bar and the market

51
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:55,539
didn't even offer alone selling selling below the double bottom is reasonable

52
00:04:55,539 --> 00:05:01,490
this is a third push down in a channel so chances are it's pretty good it's

53
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,750
pretty good setup for at least a scalp that's a pretty good reversal bar there

54
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:12,550
and that's always good for on the market reverse and again outside the bottom
