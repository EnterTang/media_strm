1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,500
Previously on Terminator The Sarah Connor Chronicles

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,200
What does this mean to you?

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:06,250
I keep seeing it in my dreams,John.It means something.

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,470
Weirdo. kook. nut.

5
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,470
I've been reading the dictionary.

6
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,870
I don't sleep.

7
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,670
Whatever happened with the explosion flipped a switch.

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,100
You don't know what you're about to do.

9
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,300
I love you,john,and you love me.

10
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,270
Your name is? it's riley.

11
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:23,400
What's the matter?

12
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,300
Never brought a girl home before? no.

13
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,500
Riley climbed out john's window.

14
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,040
Now is not the time for this.

15
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,240
Well,when is the time?

16
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,600
You bring danger into riley's life.

17
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,000
And I'm gonna keep seeing riley even if everyone thinks

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,970
It's a bad idea.

19
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,970
I understand that it's a bad idea.

20
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,670
So don't worry about it and be happy you're a machine.

21
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,140
I'm a machine. I can't be happy.

22
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,840
Anything yet?

23
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,040
I've dumped about 50,000 websites.

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,940
There are hundreds of companies with three dots in the logo.

25
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,200
Organic fruit. candles.

26
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,700
Dog collars. baby wipes.

27
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,370
Ice cream.

28
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,670
Nothing screams skynet like baby wipes and ice cream.

29
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,200
Keep looking.

30
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,840
It is something you saw in a dream.

31
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,470
And written in blood on the wall.

32
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,870
So it means something. will you just keep looking?

33
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,800
Tomorrow. I'm beat.

34
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,570
You never sleep. make yourself useful.

35
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,370
Most efficient killing machine ever invented.

36
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,970
You got her doing laundry.

37
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,070
You do never sleep.

38
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,470
One glazed. one rainbow sprinkle.

39
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,700
One cinnamon twist.

40
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,540
You never forget,do you?

41
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,200
No,I don't.

42
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,640
So how was mexico?

43
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,540
Did you get to see your buddy down there?

44
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,240
Where's the rest of it?

45
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,470
He was gone when we got there.

46
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,340
After you went all that way?

47
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,600
Bummer.

48
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,870
Yes.

49
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,340
It was a bummer.

50
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,440
Is your brother still seeing that crazy blonde?

51
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,540
Yes. it's become a problem.

52
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,300
She snuck out the window one night

53
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,640
And left the alarm off.

54
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,960
We got robbed.

55
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,460
No way.

56
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,000
Did you catch who did it?

57
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,330
Everything worked out fine.

58
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:21,200
That's a pretty zen attitude.

59
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,200
"the robbed that smiles steals something from the thief."

60
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,600
You read othello.

61
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,200
You asked me to.

62
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,200
Did you like it?

63
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,600
It was more violent than I expected.

64
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,060
I should've warned you.

65
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,460
No. everything worked out fine.

66
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,100
You're not eating your donuts.

67
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,860
Later.

68
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,860
Do you have a history of california field artillery?

69
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,030
I'm interested in the ancient muzzle-loading rifles

70
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,200
Used during the modoc indian war.

71
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,700
Uh,in the california room.

72
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,600
I've a big week.

73
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Paper due on thursday.

74
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,900
Peter the great's war with the turks

75
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,560
And the technological modernization of imperial russia.

76
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,760
It's better than it sounds.

77
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,860
What are you lookin' at?

78
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,560
Him.


80
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,230
I know him.

81
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:00,260
Not unless you're about,oh,110 years old.

82
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,960
That photo's from 1920.

83
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,200
See,december 31,1920.

84
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,830
What was he doing in 1920?

85
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,260
What is this picture from?

86
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,000
Famous new year's eve speakeasy fire

87
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
During prohibition.

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,530
43 people died.

89
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,930
There were rumors

90
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,100
Someone threw a molotov cocktail through the door.

91
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,800
Lots of rivalries between the different speakeasy clubs.

92
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,630
Over here. over here.

93
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,530
I need to know what happened to him.

94
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,960
Hello.

95
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,860
John,can you come get me?

96
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,130
Where? what's wrong?

97
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,700
At 341 grove way in van nuys.

98
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,530
Can you please just come?

99
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,200
Most periodicals from the '20s

100
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,130
Haven't been transferred to digital,

101
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,730
So this could take awhile.

102
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,130
But fire that big,

103
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,860
There's always survivor stories.

104
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,260
Like with the titanic.

105
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,630
You know,there's only one titanic survivor left,

106
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,900
Millvina dean.

107
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,900
Course,she was only two months old when it happened

108
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,500
So her story isn't particularly instructive.

109
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,330
You're a very happy person.

110
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,600
I am?

111
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,460
I don't know that many happy people.

112
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,800
Well,I guess that's my own little survivor story.

113
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,030
Of course,having bone cancer

114
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,400
Was like being the titanic and the iceberg.

115
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,460
So,uh,why do you want to find out about this guy?

116
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm interested in the past.

117
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It effects everything in the future.

118
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,630
Those who don't know history are destined to repeat it.

119
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,630
Or die.

120
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,930
What's wrong?

121
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,030
Little cold in here.

122
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,630
It's 76 degrees.

123
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,960
Check this one.

124
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,730
D6.

125
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:07,560
That's him.

126
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,400
That's the guy from the fire.

127
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,530
Who's that other man?

128
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,230
Rudolph valentino.

129
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,760
The greatest silent film star of all time?

130
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,860
Ugh,you kids today

131
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,200
With your rock and roll

132
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,900
And your obsession with medieval siege weapons.

133
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,660
Rudolph valentino

134
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:30,030
And myron stark at the premiere of the sheik.

135
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,400
What was stark doing there?

136
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,400
Living it up on the red carpet.

137
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,460
I enjoyed your film very much,mr. valentino.

138
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,460
Thank you.

139
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,830
Although I thought your decision

140
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,330
To return the gun to lady diana

141
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,030
To protect herself from the caravan of thieves

142
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,200
Was misguided

143
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,360
Given that she was a security risk.

144
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,930
Stark is shaking hands with valentino.

145
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,860
But look at his eye line.

146
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,430
He's looking at that man.

147
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:04,360
"rupert chandler."

148
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,000
Check out that hat.

149
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,760
We could search the city and county records

150
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,060
For more on stark.

151
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,200
Where are they?

152
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,960
Basement. vital records.

153
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,060
But it's locked and I don't have the keys.

154
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,560
You'll have to come back in the morning

155
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,860
And talk with barry.

156
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,800
'scuse me. where are you going?

157
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,200
Hey,excuse me.

158
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,860
Looking for someone?

159
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,930
Uh,yeah,riley. blonde girl.

160
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,730
Uh,I barely know mike's friends.

161
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,200
Uh,gail silver. mike's mom.

162
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,000
Oh,hi. I'm john. let me help you with these.

163
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,560
Oh. this is the wrong kind.

164
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,200
You said "beer."

165
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,360
How come you never introduced me

166
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,700
To your friend john?

167
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,760
'cause he's not my friend.

168
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,930
Some loner weirdo

169
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,200
Who dropped out of school.

170
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,360
What are you doing here?

171
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,030
Just looking for somebody.

172
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,730
And being helpful.

173
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,830
You could learn a lesson from him.

174
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,760
What,like sucking up to mom?

175
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,830
Is the tv in your room broken?

176
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,560
It's kinda hard to relax when you're out here.

177
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,000
I gotcha. I'm goin'.

178
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,600
I didn't know you could just send your mom off

179
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,660
To her room like that.

180
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,200
Yeah. so?

181
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,530
Who you lookin' for?

182
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,760
Girl named riley.

183
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,330
Oh,I know riley.

184
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,960
Oh,got your beer!

185
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,430
Thanks.

186
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,100
Okay,thanks.

187
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,000
What are you doing?

188
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,200
You called me all upset.

189
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,460
What--what's goin' on?

190
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,160
Oh,that--that was just--

191
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,430
This guy was bothering me,that's all.

192
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,160
Well,I have a car. let's go.

193
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,460
No. it's-- it's cool now.

194
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,260
-Come on. we can hang out a little bit. -hang out?

195
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,260
I only came to get you.

196
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,630
I'm sorry.

197
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,760
It's cool. we can--we can--we can stay.

198
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,230
Are you trying to get me fired?

199
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,300
-No. -then what are you doin' down here?

200
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,030
Looking for records on myron stark.

201
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,500
I don't think he was who everyone thinks he was.

202
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,560
I let you in

203
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,230
After hours whenever you want.

204
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,500
And for you to go and do this,

205
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,230
Exactly what I tell you not to,

206
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,500
Really not cool.

207
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,430
I need the information.

208
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,230
And I need this job. you broke the lock.

209
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,330
I'll fix it.

210
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,360
Just put it back. put it all back.

211
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,600
Don't.

212
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,300
I'm sorry.

213
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,230
I shouldn't have gone down there.

214
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:49,130
Forget it. it's no big deal.

215
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,230
Yes,it is.

216
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,130
We're friends.

217
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:56,000
I don't really have many friends.

218
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,860
Actually,I don't have any friends.

219
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,500
You? that--that can't be true.

220
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,000
So did you find anything out down there?

221
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:14,960
No. there's no record of myron stark before the fire.

222
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,460
Dead end.

223
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,830
I don't like dead ends.

224
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,730
He could've been an immigrant.

225
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,630
Came through ellis island,shortened his name.

226
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,730
Worked his way up from nothing.

227
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,760
It's the immigrant spirit.

228
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,260
Single-minded pursuit of a goal.

229
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,830
Never giving up.

230
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,930
Buying into the american dream.

231
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,600
An effective strategy.

232
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,230
Either that or he robbed banks.

233
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,030
What?

234
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:53,230
Can you show me police records?

235
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,700
Shortly after 2:00 pm,

236
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,600
A lone robber held up the la brea savings and loan.

237
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,860
Witnesses say the masked man

238
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,330
Armed with a thompson submachine gun

239
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,830
And a daring disregard for human life opened fire.

240
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,360
Eight citizens were felled

241
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,200
And did not live to tell about it.

242
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,130
This is the third bank robbed in this fashion in recent weeks.

243
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,130
Detective,can you tell us how much was looted

244
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,730
From the vault?

245
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:14,200
Over $70,000 in cash,silver,and liberty bonds.

246
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,300
Was the robber injured in the fray?

247
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,500
Police let fly with a hail of bullets.

248
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,160
The robber was hit with nearly 30 rounds,

249
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,530
But escaped on foot.

250
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,730
How in god's name did he survive?

251
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,200
that has not been ascertained.

252
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,960
A manhunt is underway.

253
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,230
You really think he robbed banks?

254
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:35,230
It's a very effective strategy.

255
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,900
But why? what did he need it for?

256
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,260
To buy into the american dream.

257
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:51,200
Stark bought parcels of land in the san fernando valley,

258
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,400
Burbank,sunland,van nuys

259
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,030
Two days after the last heist.

260
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,830
What'd he do with all that land?

261
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:58,930
He built houses.

262
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,030
I found this application

263
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,360
For a business license.

264
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,760
Construction.

265
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,960
This is worldwide news.

266
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,860
Myron stark versus rupert chandler.

267
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,160
A classic david versus goliath.

268
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,560
Real estate magnate and builder rupert chandler

269
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,800
Was the undisputed king

270
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,000
Of the expanding san fernando valley.

271
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,900
But along came a young upstart,myron stark.

272
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,360
What started as a one-man operation

273
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,030
Soon grew into a thriving business

274
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,100
That went head to head

275
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,100
With the largest builder in the county.

276
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,500
It's said stark spoke six languages,

277
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,500
Paid double the wages of his competitors,

278
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,300
And treated all of his workers equally

279
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,860
Regardless of their employment history or citizen status.

280
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,460
Stark himself could always be found shoulder to shoulder

281
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,560
With his workers,

282
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,200
A pickaxe in his strong hands.

283
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,760
Soon stark & company became a thorn

284
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,000
In the side of his rival.

285
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,260
His meteoric rise

286
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,000
Threatened to topple the "king chandler"

287
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,830
From his throne.

288
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,100
Chandler's top foreman,fred jeffers,

289
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,960
Was recently asked about the rivalry.

290
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,430
To hear jeffers tell it,"we're not worried.

291
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,700
"fly-by-nights like stark come and go.

292
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,660
"chandler's an established company with contracts

293
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,600
"booked through 1925.

294
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,600
We'll crush him like a bug."

295
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,700
Upon hearing jeffers' fighting words,

296
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,030
Stark reported to reply simply,"we'll see."

297
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,700
Here's more on chandler and jeffers.

298
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,530
And something really strange.

299
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,600
Fred jeffers,rupert chandler's man,

300
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,660
Went missing back in 1925.

301
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,600
Was never found.

302
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,660
What is this?

303
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,400
A 17-round glock 9mm semiautomatic.

304
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,060
Why do you have it?

305
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,230
In case I need it.

306
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,960
Have you ever used it?

307
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,730
Yes.

308
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,130
Are you in trouble?

309
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,400
No.

310
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,760
Are you afraid of someone?

311
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,160
Afraid? no.

312
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,960
I've seen cuts on your face.

313
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,160
There was one last week.

314
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,600
You were wearing makeup,but...

315
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,960
Sometimes I get into fights.

316
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,560
Wh--why?

317
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,000
My brother.

318
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,530
There are people out to hurt him.

319
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,600
I protect him.

320
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,330
Who protects you?

321
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,900
I do.

322
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,400
Why are we doing this?

323
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,130
Why is myron stark so important?

324
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,730
He was doing something,and it doesn't make sense to me.

325
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,800
I need to find out what it was.

326
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,130
None of this makes sense to me.

327
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:28,760
Not you,not the gun,not the guy in the photograph.

328
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,300
I know.

329
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,930
I've never fired a gun before.

330
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,960
Do you want to?

331
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,060
Sure,but...

332
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,760
Wait.

333
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,160
N--no. we can't do this here.

334
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,230
Grip it with both hands.

335
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,760
Squeeze the trigger slowly.

336
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,660
Slowly.

337
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,000
Oh,yeah.

338
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,200
Oh,my god. I'm terrible at this.

339
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,000
John.

340
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,930
No,I don't know how.

341
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,030
What,you live in a cave?

342
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,430
Come on.

343
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,760
What am I supposed to do?

344
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,260
I have no idea.

345
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,460
I just pushed those buttons at random.

346
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,500
And you sucked.

347
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,630
Hey,check you out,mr. normal.

348
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:50,460
Kill him,alex.

349
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,800
Come on,johnny. I'm rooting for you.


351
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,660
Dude,you suck.

352
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,360
Hey,come on. kill him,alex.

353
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,900
I'm gonna go. you stay here if you want.

354
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,930
No,john,wait.

355
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,430
This was a mistake.

356
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,930
Well,i-- I'm coming with you.

357
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,900
Whoa whoa. you're going? with that weirdo?

358
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,360
Yeah. I'm sorry. we have to go.

359
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,730
Oh,no,no,no. wait.

360
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,000
Give me my lighter back.

361
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,830
Your what?

362
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,600
You took my lighter.

363
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,130
No. c--no. come on,john. let's go.

364
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,260
No,no,no. give it to me.

365
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,900
Give it to me. get off me.

366
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,160
Hey,hey,you leave her alone.

367
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,700
Hey,no one's talking to you,weirdo.

368
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,530
Don't. don't. stop. come on.

369
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,800
Watch out,man.

370
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,530
Give it to me,you screwy bitch.

371
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,760
John. john.

372
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,100
Take the damn lighter.

373
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,560
Come on,john. let's get out of here.

374
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,260
I'm out here on mulholland drive

375
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,030
Where a hiker has discovered

376
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:27,860
What appears to be the body of a man who died over 60 years ago.

377
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:31,160
Tom jacobs was out for an early morning walk

378
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,760
When he spotted a piece of metal in the ravine.

379
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,400
Tom?

380
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,330
I saw what looked like the bumper of a car.

381
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,800
But when I got closer,

382
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,030
I could see that it was one of those old-timey ones,

383
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:43,060
You know,like--like you see in the movies.

384
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,830
And then I saw the bones.

385
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:48,400
Personal effects found in the vehicle

386
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,800
Reveal the remains to be those of fred jeffers,

387
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,460
A man who disappeared in the 1920s.

388
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,830
Wait! what are you doing?

389
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,930
What are you--

390
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,460
What do you want?

391
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,960
No!

392
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,300
Please stop! no!

393
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,030
"jeffers' disappearance

394
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,200
"was a terrible blow for chandler,

395
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,530
"who endured a string of tragedies

396
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:30,160
"starting with the death of his beloved son will,

397
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,060
Who died on new year's eve,1920."

398
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,700
New year's eve,1920.

399
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:42,960
Let's get 'em out of here.

400
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,360
That's rupert chandler's boy.

401
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,100
Let's cover him up. let's get him out of here.

402
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,600
Come on.

403
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,300
Will chandler died in the speakeasy fire.

404
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,230
And myron stark was there.

405
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:06,000
So there must be a connection.

406
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:28,130
I thought you were gonna kill that guy.

407
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,900
Why'd you call me?

408
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,000
Because.

409
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,600
I wanted you to come.

410
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,700
Weird way of showing it.

411
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,460
Oh,the flirting with mike thing?

412
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,500
I'm a teenage girl,john.

413
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,330
We do that kind of crap to guys we like.

414
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:49,430
The loner weirdo?

415
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,360
I don't get it.

416
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,760
Never gotten it.

417
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,300
My old foster parents

418
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,960
Are these '60s hippies.

419
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,100
Always talking like they were single-handedly saving the world

420
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,200
Because they recycled.

421
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,600
They called me the deviant.

422
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:12,100
Like,"the deviant got a "c" in math."

423
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,230
"should we take the deviant to see bruce hornsby?"

424
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,130
That's why I came up to you that day,john.

425
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,960
Because I thought since you're a weirdo,

426
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,700
You might get me.

427
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,700
My foster parents used to call me the delinquent.

428
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,400
So you did take the lighter.

429
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,000
I like shiny things.

430
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:44,860
Bad habit.

431
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,360
What happened to your real parents?

432
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,200
They died when I was little.

433
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,060
In a fire.

434
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,000
Why were you in a foster home?

435
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,760
You have your mom.

436
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,360
She was in a mental hospital.

437
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,600
That explains things.

438
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,230
She was engaged once.

439
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,500
He was a pretty cool guy.

440
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,700
Didn't work out,

441
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,560
But he was kind of the only friend we had.

442
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,400
Little while ago,he,uh,helped us with something.

443
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,660
There was an accident and his new wife died.

444
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,100
And he left.

445
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,760
That's what happens.

446
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:53,300
I shouldn't be around people.

447
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,960
Is that why you went nuclear on mike?

448
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,130
No,that's...

449
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,500
That's other stuff.

450
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,460
Do you want to talk about it?

451
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,800
Sometimes,yes.

452
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,330
Mostly no.

453
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,860
But sometimes yes.

454
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,560
I found will chandler's obituary.

455
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,860
I'm kind of peeing right now. can't it wait?

456
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,830
400 people came to his funeral.

457
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,230
He had a lot of friends.

458
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:50,930
His father had a lot of money. there's a difference.

459
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:53,030
I think stark killed him.

460
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,760
We don't even know if they knew each other.

461
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,800
And if stark wanted to kill chandler,

462
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,130
Why take out 43 innocent people?

463
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,660
It happens.

464
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,060
Do you ever think about dying?

465
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,500
About what?

466
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,460
Or about suicide?

467
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,500
Why would I think about that?

468
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,200
Because there's something wrong with you.

469
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,530
Gee,don't ever look for work as a counselor.

470
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:25,200
I've never thought about killing myself.

471
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,630
Not for a minute.

472
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,460
It would destroy my mom,for one.

473
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,430
I couldn't do that to my family,

474
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,660
To the people who love me.

475
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,600
Could you?

476
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,730
Anyways,

477
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,530
I'm not sick anymore.

478
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:41,430
I mean,I have to get a scan every six months.

479
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:45,600
But so far I'm clean.

480
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:51,600
Earlier when I cross-referenced the names of survivors

481
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,700
From the fire,this woman's name

482
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,100
Came up in a documentary about the roaring '20s.

483
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,700
It might tell us more about what happened

484
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,030
Inside the speakeasy.

485
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,360
Film vault's on the top floor.

486
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,430
You'll have to go alone.

487
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,600
Why?

488
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,000
No wheelchair access.

489
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,730
You're really strong.

490
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,660
I work out.

491
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:26,260
Wow. look at all this.

492
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,930
Dvds are all right,but this is the real deal.

493
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:32,530
Silver nitrate. raw.

494
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:34,600
Before film makers figured out all the tricks.

495
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,860
Pure humanity on film.

496
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,530
None of that computer generated,

497
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:41,330
Digital crap they do today.

498
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:46,530
All these people captured,frozen in time.

499
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:47,860
They never age.

500
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,200
I mean,100 years could pass.

501
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,830
They'll still be here. still look exactly the same.

502
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:57,830
It would be nice,wouldn't it?

503
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:00,600
Freeze yourself in a moment.

504
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,460
The best moment of your life.

505
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,600
Have things never change.

506
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,000
Be beautiful Healthy strong.

507
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,730
Anyway...

508
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:17,800
Don't let me get all a.e. housman on you.

509
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,860
Uh,the documentaries

510
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,330
Are up there.

511
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,260
We would go out to the gin joints every weekend.

512
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:35,400
We'd drink,and smoke,

513
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,530
And dance the black bottom,the charleston,

514
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:40,260
The shimmy.

515
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:45,860
Oh,I was a real bearcat back then.

516
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,700
And I was crazy in love

517
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,060
With this prizefighter.

518
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:53,960
We were together there,

519
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,400
The night when the fire started.

520
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,630
He was helping everybody out.

521
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,130
And I just remember...

522
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:09,060
Sitting on the curb...

523
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,200
Crying.

524
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,430
People said that,uh,

525
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,760
Someone threw a bomb in the door.

526
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,000
Now,to tell you the truth,

527
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,660
I was pretty zozzled.That's what we called it then.

528
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:25,200
But I didn't see a bomb.

529
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,730
Uh,what I did see was this,um,

530
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:31,060
This flash of blue light

531
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,000
And sparks,

532
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,930
Then the craziest thing.

533
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:38,360
This man in the middle of the room,

534
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,460
Naked as a jaybird.

535
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:43,900
I don't know.

536
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:47,630
Maybe I just imagined the whole thing.

537
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:51,100
Who knows?

538
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,630
Probably the liquor talking.

539
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:56,460
The fire,it was an accident.

540
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,800
Yeah,sounds like there was some electrical problem.

541
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,060
He didn't mean to kill all those people.

542
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,960
No. of course not.

543
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,800
It's just like in the wizard of oz

544
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,200
When the house falls on the witch.

545
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,300
Give me your clothes.

546
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,960
Hey,where are you going?

547
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,460
I know what he was looking at.

548
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,930
He was measuring the stars' radial velocity,

549
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:06,000
The distance in parsecs,and the cartesian coordinates.

550
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,100
What? why?

551
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,300
To pinpoint the date.

552
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,330
You can tell the date by looking at the sky?



555
00:32:22,714 --> 00:32:24,660
Stellar motion can be used to calculate

556
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,560
What the sky will look like for hundreds of years

557
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,800
In the future or the past.

558
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,300
Why is the date so important?

559
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:36,000
It's not. unless it's the wrong date.


561
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:44,400
Myron Stark was in the wrong place

562
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,160
At the wrong time.

563
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,800
"if we cry because the sun has gone out of our lives,

564
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,100
"our tears can prevent us

565
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,470
From seeing the stars."

566
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:04,300
Chandler's eulogy for his son?

567
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,800
"today is a day for mourning.

568
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,200
"but it is also a day to remember my son.

569
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,770
"a gifted young man with a grand heart.

570
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:13,300
"a budding architect,

571
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,270
"his dream was to build pico tower

572
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:17,340
"on the corner of 3rd and pico.

573
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,600
"that was his land,

574
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,800
"the soil where his dreams were to take root.

575
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,240
"it will remain his land forever,

576
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,940
"never to be sold or developed.

577
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,470
"instead,his legacy will live on

578
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,000
"in a memorial garden

579
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,440
I will plant there in his honor."

580
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,340
That can't be right.

581
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,600
There is a pico tower in downtown la.

582
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,600
It's an architectural landmark.

583
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,070
We took a field trip there in third grade.

584
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,540
Someone must've built it.

585
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:47,840
Tax records.

586
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,600
They show Chandler's rivalry with Stark

587
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,970
Cost him everything.

588
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:54,600
His business went under in july 1925.

589
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,040
His assets were auctioned off

590
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,540
To pay off his debt,

591
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,770
Including the property at 3rd and pico.

592
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:02,140
Bankruptcy. tragic accidents.

593
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,040
The death of a beloved son.

594
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,100
It's like the family's cursed.

595
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,540
Mr. chandler,I'm myron stark.

596
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,370
Do I know you?

597
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,840
No,you don't know me.

598
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,500
Mr. chandler's in a hurry.

599
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:22,240
I'm interested in purchasing a piece of property.

600
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:24,970
3rd and pico.

601
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:28,370
That land's not for sale.

602
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:29,900
I'll pay twice what it's worth.

603
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:30,870
Are you deaf?

604
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:33,200
Are you deaf? He said it's not for sale.

605
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:49,200
Does it say who bought it? the pico property?

606
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,540
M.s. stark?

607
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,770
So he not only bought the land,

608
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:57,900
But he designed it himself?

609
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,970
The building.

610
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:01,370
It's about the building. what is?

611
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,800
Stark accidentally killed the man

612
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,670
Who was going to build it,so he had to build it himself.

613
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,500
Everything he did was to drive chandler under

614
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,940
And get him to sell that land.

615
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,900
Okay.

616
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,470
There must be a reason why stark needed to build it.

617
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,100
You wanna know the really weird thing?

618
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,300
Stark disappeared two weeks before the building opened

619
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,370
In may of 1927.

620
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:26,040
Disappeared?

621
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,470
Fell off the face of the earth. never seen again.

622
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:31,370
What's happened at pico tower since it was built?

623
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,900
Anything important?

624
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,400
Anything on new year's eve?

625
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,940
New year's eve when?

626
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,200
Any new year's eve.

627
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,600
Not that I can see.

628
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,270
In fact,it's closed now.

629
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,770
They had to retrofit after the last earthquake.

630
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:44,400
I'm not sure when they're reopening.




634
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,500
Hey. I thought you left.

635
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,170
What are you doing back here?

636
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:17,300
Are you all right? what happened?

637
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,640
I'm fine.

638
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,900
Your brother again?

639
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,900
I'm fine.

640
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,370
You never touched your donuts.

641
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,670
I wasn't hungry.

642
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,540
Your muscles are weak.

643
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,140
It was difficult for you to pull the trigger

644
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,200
Of the glock.

645
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,900
And you've lost 8% of your body weight

646
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,570
In the past two weeks.

647
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:37,570
When I carried you to the film vault,

648
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:38,640
I weighed you.

649
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,740
Wait,what?

650
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,670
This whole night,the entire time,

651
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,840
You've been examining me?

652
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,240
What--what the hell is going on here?

653
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,970
Your cancer is back.

654
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:53,040
You have a secondary tumor in the long bone of your arm

655
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,000
And possibly your lungs.

656
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,940
Are you joking?

657
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,670
No.

658
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:01,000
Then you're crazy,you don't know what you're talking about.

659
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,670
Ewing's sarcoma. first identified in the 1920s--

660
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:06,800
I know what it is,okay? I'm the one in here!

661
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:12,340
No wonder you don't have any friends.

662
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,600
You can't just do things like that.

663
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,870
You can't just show up whenever you need somethin'.

664
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:20,140
You can't carry a gun around and freak people out,

665
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:22,800
And walk into the bathroom when a guy's taking a leak

666
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,500
And ask him if he's gonna kill himself.

667
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,970
And you can't just blurt things out

668
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:30,340
Like "you have cancer,"

669
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,670
Especially to someone who's already had it.

670
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,400
You have no clue,do you?

671
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,540
You have no idea what it's like

672
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:41,500
To have something inside of you,

673
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,500
Something that's damaged.

674
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:47,040
It's like a bomb...

675
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,400
Waiting to go off.

676
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,470
I need to finish my paper.

677
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:57,670
You should make an appointment

678
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:59,070
With your oncologist.

679
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,370
The tumor's still small.
