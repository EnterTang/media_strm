1
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,540
Come on. Come on.           

2
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,840
Got you. I got you again.       

3
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,320
I got you. I got ya!          

4
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,180
You're dead! No, I'm not!       

5
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,960
Aargh!                 

6
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,240
Yeah, right. I told you, didn't I?  

7
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,640
It's dangerous round here!       
Oi! Where d'you think you're going?!

8
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,200
Very dangerous indeed!         

9
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,700
Draper, don't chase 'em up there!   

10
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,760
Told you, lads.            

11
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,760
Should've kept away, shouldn't you?!

12
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,480
Ah, Detective Sergeant Bacchus,    
I didn't realise you cared!      

13
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,440
I don't. Special occasion, is it?   

14
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,120
Wedding anniversary.          

15
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,640
Ten out of ten for remembering.    

16
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,840
It was yesterday. Five out of ten.  

17
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,520
Ah, shut your head, will you, man.  
Pass us the bin. John!         

18
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,100
Put 'em down.             
We've got a body out at Rinton.    

19
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,440
"Let's go with Labour", that's their
slogan. "Let's go with Labour".    

20
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,880
But does anybody have any idea     
where they're going?          

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,320
Come on...               

22
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,960
It's touch and go, they reckon.    

23
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,240
The general election on Thursday.   

24
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,160
Ah. Yep.                

25
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:31,600
Neck-and-neck, and we had a 9,000   
majority last time round. "We"?    

26
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,560
You don't vote Labour, do you, sir? 

27
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,760
Would that be a problem?        

28
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,640
You like paying taxes, do you?     

29
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,320
No, not really.            

30
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,280
Oh. Have you signed          
that form for us?           

31
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,360
What form? Sir, I keep...       

32
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,720
The seminar down in London       
at the weekend.            

33
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:53,160
Oh, yeah. "Detectives and the     
criminal underworld - a modern     
approach to policing in the 1960s."  

34
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,280
Yeah. Yeah. I know the man       
who's running the course. Yeah?    
You're not going.           

35
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,720
Perhaps the African can tell us!    

36
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,280
I'm a British subject now, Mr Mundy,

37
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,200
with a British passport        
and these people know me.       

38
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,760
Yeah, tell them about the war.     

39
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,200
Where was he              
when you were risking your life, eh?

40
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,200
Sssh!                 

41
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,600
Unlike some, Mr Mundy,         
I live in County Durham.        

42
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,800
I work in County Durham!        

43
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,680
And I've built up my businesses    
in County Durham.           

44
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,600
And I'm not a London barrister     

45
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,800
who only turns up at the weekends   
when he feels like riding to hounds!

46
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,280
That was a cheap dig,         
that, wasn't it, sir?         

47
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,680
Up and down the country the Tories  
are about to be rejected.       

48
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,440
Rubbish.                
Excuse me. Men like you, Mr Mundy.  

49
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,920
Men who've had their chance      
for 13 years and have failed.     

50
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,440
Clear the roads, please.        
You're blocking the thoroughfare.   

51
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,120
There are cars coming. Thirteen    
years of bone-headed Tory misrule!  

52
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,600
Nonsense! Can we clear the road,    
please? We're trying to get through.
Oh, yes. Sorry. Apologies.       

53
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,480
You see? Even the police        
want to get rid of you!        
LAUGHTER                            

54
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,380
On the pavements, everyone.      

55
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,080
Oh...                 

56
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,620
You better get to work, Jed.      

57
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,200
Off you go. I wouldn't care      
but he's a Rhodesian.         

58
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,240
You don't want a bigmouth       
like him winning, do you?       

59
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,240
I don't vote in elections,       
Sergeant, so it's all the same to me.

60
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,540
Morning.                

61
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,360
Round the back, sir.          

62
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,300
Morning.                

63
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,320
Ah.                  

64
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,120
He's everywhere!            

65
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,240
Chief Inspector Gently.        

66
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,260
This is Detective Sergeant Bacchus.  

67
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,480
Henry Blythely, the miller.      

68
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,820
He's in here. Follow me.        

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,320
I had just finished working,      

70
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,360
and these lads come in         

71
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,000
and get chased up here.        

72
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,720
Patrick Fuller, mill manager. Yes?   

73
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,220
Yeah.                 

74
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,280
Climbs the ladder, secures the rope,

75
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,520
rope round his neck...         

76
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,800
Off he goes.              
Why have they called us here?     

77
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,040
Because somebody might've hoisted   
him up there, Sergeant.        

78
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,920
Mr Fuller a friend of yours, was he? 

79
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,680
We were close...            

80
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,120
for a good many years.         

81
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,880
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't        
mean to offend with the...       

82
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,520
Try and be a bit            
more thoughtful, eh?          

83
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,160
I reckon about eight to ten hours.   

84
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,720
Do you want to take a bet?       

85
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,400
No I don't. You're too good at it.  

86
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,280
The rope's cut in deep, sir. Yeah.  

87
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,360
Too thin for the job.         

88
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,520
No sign of a suicide note?       

89
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,880
No. Just them.             
Must be an office somewhere.      

90
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,520
He was just the loveliest boss.    
And...and...              

91
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,600
and I've never known          
anyone die before!           

92
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,680
Ssh. It's all right. Here you go.   

93
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,320
Look, take that.            

94
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,720
Bit too thoughtful, maybe.       

95
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,080
SHE BLOWS HER NOSE LOUDLY            

96
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,320
Yeah? No. Invoice.           

97
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:48,580
Can I help? Well, we're just      
wondering if Mr Fuller's left     
a note or a letter, or anything.    

98
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,200
Guv...                 

99
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,440
Looks like a robbery, that.      

100
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,480
Can you have a look at this, please? 

101
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,140
Don't touch anything.         

102
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,600
There's meant to be about       
50, 60, #70 in there!         

103
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
So you handle the petty cash?     

104
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,840
Me? No, I never go in there.      

105
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,320
I mean, I'm only 17.          

106
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,200
So how do you know how much was    
in there? Well, Patrick asks me    
to keep a log.             

107
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,800
Was the office locked this morning?  
I only came up with you, didn't I?  

108
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,880
Cos when I just arrived        
they'd just found Patrick. So, no...

109
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,320
I mean, I've got the keys.       

110
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,920
Get forensics out.           

111
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,820
Can I use your telephone?       

112
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,340
D'you want to see me keys? OK.     

113
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,400
They're in here somewhere!       

114
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,920
My wife's very upset.         

115
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,040
She a friend of the deceased as well?
We were all friends here.       
It's a family firm.          

116
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,760
Who's the next of kin?         

117
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,800
Brenda, his wife.           

118
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,600
Ah. I'll need an address, please.   

119
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,120
Mr Blythely, how many people have   
a key to Patrick Fuller's office?   

120
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,600
Patrick himself, Julie...       

121
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,480
Draper, myself.            

122
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,380
Why Draper?              

123
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,880
He's the foreman.           
No, I don't know why either.      

124
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,240
Last foreman retired four months    
back, Patrick chose Draper.      

125
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,960
Best man for the job, he says.     
Cos I queried it.           

126
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,760
I mean, the man can barely       
bother to be lazy.           

127
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,840
Did he bring him in from outside?   

128
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,420
No, no. He's worked here for years, 
if you can call it work.        

129
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,840
Thank you.               

130
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,400
Mr Draper. Can you gather everybody  
in the canteen, please?        

131
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,600
Aye, I'm just doing this.       

132
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,080
Now?                  

133
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,000
HE SHOUTS: Sir, yes, sir!       

134
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,820
CRYING                              

135
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,440
Look at me. Making an exhibition    
of myself. That's all right.      

136
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,040
It's very upsetting.          

137
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,880
Brenda.                

138
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,360
Patrick Fuller's wife...        
that's her address.          

139
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,320
I think one of you           
should go straight away.        

140
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,380
Thank you. If we could have      
you in the canteen now, please.    

141
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,560
OK?                  

142
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,980
D'you wanna chuck us your hankie?   

143
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,200
Forensics are on their way, sir.    

144
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,720
And an ambulance.           

145
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,800
SHE BLOWS HER NOSE LOUDLY           

146
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,200
Canteen please, Julie.         

147
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,280
Are you thinking what I'm thinking, 
sir?                  

148
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:13,000
There's no suicide note. I don't    
know what Patrick Fuller's doing    
here in the middle of the night.    

149
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,400
It's not his job to mix        
the flour, though, is it?       

150
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,760
My first question is this.       

151
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,640
Have any of you been up to       
the office this morning,        
Patrick Fuller's office?        

152
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,080
Yes, Julie, I know you have.      

153
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:44,120
I ask this because the office     
was open. As was the safe and the   
petty cash box, which is empty.    

154
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,880
I shall need all of you on nightshift
to remain behind for questioning.   

155
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,800
And in order to exclude you all,    
I shall want your fingerprints taken.

156
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,520
You calling us tea leaves?       

157
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,920
Why don't you shut up, Draper,     
you're a moron.            

158
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,360
Somebody's dead, man. Oh, you     
managed to come to work, have you?  

159
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,280
Had permission to help the campaign 
this morning. Permission to be his  
bum boy.                

160
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,840
Shut your stupid face, Draper.     

161
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,320
The pair of you!            
There's a dead man upstairs.      

162
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,280
Show some respect.           

163
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,080
Be a bit more thoughtful.       

164
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,120
Why is there an ambulance outside?  

165
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,760
Mr Pershore!              
Mr Pershore. Thank God you've come. 

166
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,440
Chief Inspector Gently, sir.      

167
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,080
Police? May I ask           
why you're here, Mr Pershore?     

168
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,680
Why I'm here?             

169
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,440
I own the mill.            

170
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,720
Hanged? Some time last night.     

171
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,800
What a bloody waste of a life.     

172
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,760
You're assuming suicide, then?     

173
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,520
Well...what else?           

174
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,480
Can you think of any reason why    
Patrick Fuller would kill himself?   

175
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,200
No. Just happened to          
be passing, did you?          

176
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,440
No, I try to call in everyday to    
check things are running smoothly.  

177
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,800
Though you're up to          
your eyes in the election.       

178
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,520
Business is business. People depend 
on the mill for their livelihoods.  

179
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,920
I believe...              
Yeah, I've heard the speech.      

180
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:08,440
Maybe you didn't trust Mr       
Fuller to run the place properly?   
I trusted Patrick implicitly.     

181
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,720
Sir, we've found something.      

182
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,480
Don't go anywhere, will you?      

183
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,880
Democracy will just have to muddle  
along without you for a while.     

184
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,800
I'm trying to tame him.        

185
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,200
HE LAUGHS                            

186
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,040
It's over here, sir.          
It's an earring.            

187
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,440
Got a handkerchief, Taylor? Sir.    

188
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,220
Thank you.               

189
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,480
And then there was this, sir.     
Torn clothing, maybe?         

190
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,360
That could match            
Fuller's jacket, that.         

191
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,120
Get forensics on it, will you?     
Yes, sir.               

192
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,280
What're you thinking, guv?       

193
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,040
Not sure.               

194
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,800
Still suicide, but with petty cash   
missing and that and this.       

195
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,000
Oh, somebody has got to go and     
break the bad news to the wife.    

196
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,600
I'm afraid it's you. Thank you.    

197
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,440
Oh, and when I get back, sir,     
I want to talk about that seminar.  

198
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,240
Yeah, I read the bumf.         
It's a recruitment seminar.      

199
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,000
You looking for another job, John?   

200
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,960
We need to talk soon.         

201
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,800
Fair enough.              

202
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,500
Mrs Fuller? Yes.            

203
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,040
I'm Detective Sergeant Bacchus.    

204
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,460
May I come in?             

205
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,940
Patrick's dead, isn't he?       

206
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,980
Um, Mrs Fuller, it's...        

207
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,060
It seems possible that your      
husband took his own life.       

208
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,940
Yes. I'm sorry.            

209
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,060
Did you already know about this? No.

210
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,220
It'll all come out, won't it?     

211
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,440
My life...               

212
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,000
picked over.              

213
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,340
Laughed at. Gossiped about.      

214
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,840
What will all come out?        

215
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,140
Patrick's...sordid...         

216
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,800
behaviour.               

217
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,660
He had another woman.         

218
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,500
If you can call            
a 17-year-old girl a woman.      

219
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,040
17?                  

220
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,940
Oh, I expect you noticed her.     

221
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,580
Men seem to.              

222
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,800
Julie?                 

223
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,220
You don't think Patrick hired     
her for her secretarial skills,    
do you? Or her conversation?      

224
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:02,420
To call her as thick          
as two short planks wouldn't      
be fair on the planks.         

225
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,020
How do you know about this?      

226
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,580
Oh, I have a sense of smell.      

227
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,520
Galore by Five Star.          

228
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,500
Her perfume.              

229
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,300
All over him,             
when he'd been working late.      

230
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,140
And did it make him feel better?    

231
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,540
Did it make him feel          
like a real man, again?        

232
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,380
I don't think so.           

233
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,580
I'm not sure I'm with you here,    
Mrs Fuller. Make him feel better    
about what?              

234
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:33,140
He'd been utterly humiliated. By who?

235
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,620
By that dreadful man that we all    
have to be so grateful to, don't we? 

236
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,760
Who pays us next to nothing      
for the business and then...      

237
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,980
Look, look at this!          

238
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:49,280
He screws Patrick into the       
ground over the mill,         

239
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,060
then he gives him a car!        

240
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,920
How kind! How superior!        

241
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,800
How very socialist of him!       

242
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,860
Are you saying that your        
husband used to own the mill?     
It was the family firm.        

243
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,720
Sold it to Pershore a year ago.    

244
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,020
I say sold. It was daylight robbery. 

245
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,660
But Mr Man Of The People,       
he kept Patrick on, you see.      

246
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,620
As an employee.            

247
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:19,640
Working him all hours,         
introducing workers' rights      

248
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:25,040
and trade union-negotiated rest    
breaks, but what about our rights?   

249
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,080
He stole his pride,          

250
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,060
and now he's given him         
an early grave.            

251
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,660
He was a changed man.         

252
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,940
Oh, I lost my husband         
a long time ago.            

253
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,780
Obviously the mill's non-operational
until the police say otherwise, but 
if you wouldn't mind staying here   

254
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:50,300
until they have all they need.     
You will, of course, be paid      
for a full day's work.         

255
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:58,660
May I also say I know lots of you   
have known and worked for Patrick   
for many years...           

256
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,760
The foreman not interested       
in what the owner has to say?     

257
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,060
He's paying us to sit and drink tea.
That's all I need to hear.       

258
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,960
Can't buy my vote, though.       

259
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:16,260
Calls himself a socialist. If this  
was Cheltenham he'd stand as a Tory.
It's power he wants.          

260
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,780
You don't seem very upset       
by Patrick Fuller's death.       

261
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,940
Crying like a baby inside.       

262
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,280
Mr Pershore says can he have a word?

263
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,720
How long have you known        
Mr Pershore, Jed?           

264
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,220
Few months.              

265
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,560
He's the best man I've ever met.    

266
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,520
When I first met him          
I was on the floor.          

267
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,740
He's picked us up           
and give us a new start.        

268
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,540
Like he'll do with the whole      
town when he wins the seat.      

269
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,060
When did you last see Patrick?     

270
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,540
Um, it was...             
It was yesterday afternoon.      

271
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,600
Patrick, you're early. Go away.    

272
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,780
What's wrong? What's happened?     
I said go away! Are you deaf?     

273
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,340
Patrick!                

274
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,500
SHOUTING: GO AWAY!           

275
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,660
'Did he behave like that        
very often?'              

276
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:17,760
More and more, since he lost      
the mill to Pershore.         

277
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,080
And why did              
your husband sell the mill?      

278
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,600
No, what you should be asking is why 
he didn't sell it a long time ago!   

279
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,060
Stubborn pride. Losing money?     

280
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,220
Year after year.            

281
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:35,660
He was borrowing just to see it get  
further and further into debt.     

282
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,100
I had to borrow it from my mother.   

283
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,380
I had to lie to my mother!       

284
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:45,340
And then up steps Mr Pershore.     

285
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,240
Our saviour.              

286
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,980
Our knight in shining armour.     
Sorry, I can't...           

287
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,060
SHE SOBS                             

288
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:03,800
Don't worry about it, Julie, it    
was going to the cleaners anyway.   
I'm so sorry. I'm so useless.     

289
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,440
Julie, it's fine.           

290
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,260
Thank you.               

291
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,900
She was very fond of her boss.     
We all were.              

292
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,140
Except Sam Draper.           

293
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,420
Though he had more reason       
to be than most.            

294
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,700
Yes.                  

295
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,420
So why did Patrick Fuller       
promote a man like Sam Draper?     

296
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,220
Oh, we all make mistakes.       

297
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,060
Is that what your young        
friend has against him?        

298
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,600
My young friend?            

299
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,520
Yeah. Jed Jimpson?           

300
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,740
Well, Jed would have made       
a better foreman, but...        

301
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,600
not my decision. You employ      
a manager, you let him manage.     

302
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,780
Would being overlooked have made Jed 
angry with Patrick Fuller?       
Not at all.              

303
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:56,260
Jed has eyes on a bigger prize.    

304
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,180
The bright lights of London.      
A career in politics.         

305
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,720
Ah. Another one who can't wait     
to shake off the North East?      
Your sergeant?             

306
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,260
Oh, yeah.               

307
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:10,020
Well, I can see what Jed gets from   
helping you with your campaign,    

308
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,080
but what does he get from       
working in a flour mill?        

309
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,120
Well, Jed needs some stability     
in his life.              

310
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,800
He needs...              

311
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,780
Well, he needs a father.        
That's you, is it?           

312
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,960
Yes, in a way.             

313
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,000
Where's his real father?        

314
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,720
Dead. Six or seven months ago.     

315
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,020
Dead how? Liver failure.        

316
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,580
Alcoholic?               

317
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,220
Jed doesn't talk about it and     
I didn't know the man, but...     

318
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,820
he was devastated.           

319
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,760
Jed has real potential.        

320
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,820
He has ideas.             

321
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,260
Concrete ideas,            
not university ideas.         

322
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,140
Ways to help people.          

323
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,920
With a bit of money from me,      
he turned an old workshop       

324
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:56,320
into a place where the young lads   
could congregate, instead of getting
into trouble on street corners.    

325
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,140
Practical outcomes, you see.      

326
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,860
That's what politics is about.     

327
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,460
Real leadership. And Jed        
will be a real leader someday.     

328
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,840
So, what did make Patrick       
Fuller choose Sam Draper?       

329
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,400
I don't know.             

330
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,200
See, when we arrived this morning,   
the safe in Patrick Fuller's office  

331
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,540
was open,               
but it hadn't been broken into.    

332
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,680
Now, we think that some        
petty cash had been taken.       

333
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:29,860
So obviously I need to find out    
if anything else is missing.      

334
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,080
You are presumably familiar      
with the contents of this safe?    

335
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,280
Yes, of course.            
Are you a key holder? Yes.       

336
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,060
Who else has a key to the safe?    

337
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,100
Only Patrick Fuller.          

338
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,820
Something wrong? No.          

339
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,860
Something missing? Er, no...      

340
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,900
Uh, well...              

341
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,280
There's an insurance policy,      

342
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:01,020
but that's probably          
held at my solicitor's.        
There's the petty cash, of course.  

343
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,740
It should have contained...      

344
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,780
..#68, 18 shillings and four pence. 

345
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,560
When did you last see         
Patrick Fuller alive?         

346
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,440
Yesterday afternoon.          

347
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,580
I called him over to see me      
at my election headquarters.      

348
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,760
I'd just had a visit          
from the firm's auditors.       

349
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,200
There were holes in the accounts.   

350
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,140
#1,500?!                

351
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,980
But where's it gone?          

352
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,620
This is what audits are for,      
Patrick.                

353
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,680
There'll be an explanation.      

354
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,900
There always is.            
PHONE RINGS                         

355
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,280
Yes?                  

356
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,840
Yes, I'm coming now.          

357
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,260
I'll go through everything.      
I'll track it down. I promise.     

358
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,860
I should've stayed with him      
and sorted it out.           

359
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,460
But I was busy.            

360
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,380
Yesterday was a frantic day.      

361
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,540
Did it occur to you at the time    
he might've taken the money?      

362
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,240
No. Absolutely not. Not then.     

363
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,080
And now?                

364
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:01,020
Why didn't you tell          
me this straightaway?         

365
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,700
Because I don't want to        
believe this about Patrick.      

366
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,380
Now, look, there's something      
else I need to tell you.        

367
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:12,040
I came to find Patrick         
at the mill last night.        

368
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,780
What time was this? About 11.     

369
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:17,880
Patrick wasn't here,          
so I let myself into the office.    

370
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,520
I'd had time to think.         

371
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,500
I'd remembered there'd been      
an accounting error at one       
of my other companies.         

372
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:28,020
If the same thing had happened here,
I could call Patrick, tell him     
to stop worrying.           

373
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,260
So, er...               

374
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,960
opened the safe, but the        
accounts books weren't there.     

375
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,780
He must have taken them home.     

376
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,060
What I did find, though,        
was an envelope containing #500.    

377
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,820
And no indication           
of what it was for.          

378
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,080
Where's this #500 now?         

379
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,780
In my safe at my campaign office.   
I need to see it.           

380
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,500
Morning, boys.             
Morning, Mr Pershore. Carry on.    

381
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,980
Oh, that's it! Off to work.      

382
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:18,260
Hello, everybody.           
Morning, Mr Pershore.         

383
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,500
Thursday's winner.           

384
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,100
Yes! Thanks, Jed.           

385
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,240
Jed's enthusiasm is          
sometimes a little bit...       

386
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,360
Chemically induced?          

387
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,500
I'm helping the lad onto        
the straight and narrow,        
one step at a time.          

388
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:45,500
Will I be getting your vote,      
Mr Gently? No, but then neither    
will anybody else.           

389
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,980
The #500, please.           

390
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,760
These holes in the accounts.      

391
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,660
How long had it been going on?     

392
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,220
#1,500 over three months...      

393
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,880
an initial withdrawal of 500,     

394
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,600
then a month later, 1,000.       

395
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,540
And Patrick Fuller never came     
back yesterday with an explanation?  

396
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,180
No.                  

397
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:24,300
Chief Inspector, I have many      
enemies in the local Tory press.    

398
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,920
They will make mischief out      
of this if it becomes public.     

399
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,660
A free press is part of a democracy. 

400
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:36,900
Would you tell me the serial numbers 
on the first and last notes, please? 

401
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:43,680
D64-741271.              

402
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:49,280
D64-741371.              

403
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,340
Thank you.               

404
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,500
Sequential.              

405
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,500
Now put the notes back         
in the safe, please.          

406
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:19,300
So, when you found the #500, did you 
telephone Patrick Fuller and ask him 

407
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,820
why there was such a large amount   
of unexplained cash in your safe?   

408
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,340
No.                  

409
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,340
Why not?                

410
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,760
Mr Gently, I didn't know        
any more what to think.        

411
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:35,240
Holes in the accounts,         
Patrick looking as if he had all the
cares of the world on his shoulders.

412
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:40,140
I decided not to pursue the      
matter until after polling day.    
If there was going to be...      

413
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,920
a scandal of some kind,        

414
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:45,420
I wanted to protect my campaign.    

415
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:52,000
And if that's contributed       
to what's happened, then I'm partly 
responsible for a friend's death.   

416
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,140
Did you lock up when you left?     

417
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,660
Yes.                  

418
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,380
Did...                 

419
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:00,300
Did Patrick...leave a note?      

420
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,580
No. Not that we know of.        

421
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,460
Is there anything else you'd like   
to tell me about Patrick Fuller,    
Mr Pershore?              

422
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,940
No.                  

423
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,660
So, Fuller's got woman trouble,    

424
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:22,020
money trouble, and he's behaving    
like a man under pressure. Yeah.    

425
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,140
What's the connection?         

426
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:27,720
Did she think he was stealing money? 
He wouldn't've told her if he was.  

427
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,620
Feeling enough pressure to hang    
himself? She seemed to think so,    

428
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,800
thought his behaviour         
was really strange.          

429
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,040
Look, there's a store room       
with a woman's lost earring in it.  

430
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,660
A piece of Fuller's jacket snagged  
on a nail on the wall.         

431
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:44,240
He was knocking Julie         
off in that store room.        
We've got to talk to her.       

432
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,780
Yeah, all right. Right.        

433
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:51,220
I'll bring a couple of sheets in case
she wants to blow her nose again.   

434
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,300
So, was Pershore            
trying to bribe you then?       

435
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,680
Couldn't actually tell. I think    
he's a bit too intelligent for that. 

436
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,180
Get away, man, the man's as bent    
as a dog's hind leg.          

437
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,820
What more do you need to know?     

438
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:07,080
He takes the mill off         
Fuller for tuppence ha'penny and    

439
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,260
then he swans around Durham talking 
about "let's change the world".    

440
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:16,100
What does he want to change the    
world for? He's already making     
a fortune out of it, thank you.    

441
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,660
And he wears puff juice.        

442
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,240
Beg your pardon?            

443
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,760
Scent. It's urgh... Don't tell     
me you couldn't smell it on him.    

444
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,780
It's like an Egyptian knocking shop.

445
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,040
Sorry, I just...            

446
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,640
I just don't like him, he's...     

447
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,600
Oh, sir.                

448
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,000
Please can I go on that course? No. 

449
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,280
Why? Because you don't need to.    

450
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,860
I can summarise it           
for you in two sentences.       

451
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,500
"A modern approach           
to policing crime in London".     

452
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,280
One, find out where the villains    
drink. Two, ask them for a bribe.   

453
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,740
You're just a cynic, guv. Am I?    

454
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,240
I'll go over your head on this.    
You what?               

455
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,200
I really want this.          

456
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,140
There is no future for me here.    
See you at the mill.          

457
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,540
Better late than never.        

458
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:14,720
Pathologist said Fuller was      
on the job shortly before he died,  

459
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,660
and forensics have found fibres    
on the contents of the safe.      

460
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,160
Possibly from work gloves.       
Where've you been?           

461
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,160
Talking to people           
about Geoffrey Pershore.        

462
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:27,640
Right. And? His parents owned a lot 
of farmland in Southern Rhodesia,   

463
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,000
but he was educated here.       
Fought in the war.           

464
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,540
So did Hitler. Hitler didn't      
fly a spitfire for the RAF.      

465
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:39,260
Right, well, you know, then he's    
a war hero, let's give him a medal. 
We did.                

466
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:43,560
Since then he's settled here      
and built up a string of        
successful businesses.         

467
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,400
As you do, if you're a socialist.   

468
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,980
Where's Julie? She's waiting for us. 

469
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:52,080
As you can see, the mill's       
re-opened. Except the place      
where we found the body.        

470
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,240
Give me a minute. And tell the     
Blythelys I want to talk to them.   

471
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,160
This your office?           
See why you're a detective.      

472
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,160
These yours?              

473
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,160
I'm just more and more impressed.   

474
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,940
Show some respect.           

475
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,940
A man lost his life here.       

476
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,880
The man who gave you your job.     

477
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:35,320
The job that nobody else seems to   
think you deserve. Explain that to   
me. Best man available.        

478
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,160
Well, you don't do anything,      
Mr Draper.               

479
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,960
You're not a natural leader, are you?

480
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,380
Army disagreed.            

481
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,560
I was a sergeant in the Engineers.  

482
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:49,260
Not one of the few, I know, like    
Pershore. I was one of the many.    

483
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:53,240
Didn't come back to rich parents    
or university.             

484
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,380
I came back to nowt, Mr Gently.    

485
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,360
Except broken promises.        

486
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,100
So I'll take what I can get.      

487
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:06,600
Do you think Patrick Fuller      
killed himself, Mr Draper?       

488
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,360
You should be             
talking to Jed Jimpson.        

489
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,760
He was here with Blythely       
last night.              

490
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:17,500
Rowing with Fuller yesterday. About 
what? The machines were full tilt,   
I couldn't hear.            

491
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,980
It was threatening. It was nasty.   

492
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,120
Why didn't you mention this before?  

493
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,600
You never asked us.          

494
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,600
Too busy calling me lazy.       

495
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,960
Right.                 

496
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,260
Tell us about Patrick Fuller, Julie.

497
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,800
He was a Capricorn, the same as me. 

498
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,960
I think that's why we got on.     

499
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,820
What are you, Sergeant Bacchus?    

500
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,600
I've got you a present.        

501
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,960
Oh! Um... No, no, no, I didn't...   

502
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,280
Ah, thank you. That's...        

503
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:01,640
I didn't mean his star sign, Julie, 
you know, I was talking about...    

504
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:05,760
I went out with this bloke once,    
right, and I said to him,       

505
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,040
I asked, "What star sign are you?"  
And you never guess what he said.   

506
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,620
Herpes.                

507
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,600
Made us laugh for weeks.        

508
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,240
Herpes isn't even a star sign. No.  

509
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,800
Er, Julie. Erm...           

510
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,920
Patrick Fuller.            
You were close, weren't you?      

511
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,520
I'm gonna miss him.          

512
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,880
He was so lovely to work for.     

513
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:41,180
Ever so kind and gentle and very    
patient, cos I'm still learning the 
job and me spelling's shocking.    

514
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:46,240
I goes, "How come there's a P in    
pneumatic then?" And Patrick says,  
"The P is silent,           

515
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,380
"same as in swimming."         

516
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:52,320
Which just confused us even more,   
but me dad explained when I got    

517
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,800
home, and he didn't mean that     
sort of P. It was a joke.       

518
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,780
Tell us about working late       
with Mr Fuller.            

519
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:08,120
Half past six sometimes. Yeah.     

520
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,880
Was that in the morning, was it?    

521
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,660
In the morning?            

522
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,880
No, he wasn't that bad!        

523
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:21,140
Those are nice earrings, Julie.    
And the perfume you wear,       
is that Galore by any chance?     

524
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:24,700
Yeah. And did Patrick buy you these?

525
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:28,280
The earrings and the perfume?     
What's going on?            

526
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:33,420
You and the boss, Julie!        
Were you having it off with him?!   
That's...               

527
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:36,800
I'm going to tell my dad        
you said that.             

528
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:41,180
And copper or no copper he's going  
to come down here and thump you.    

529
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,480
Julie, erm...             

530
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,400
Your earring...            

531
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,960
..was found in the store room.     
My earrings are here.         

532
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,500
And I have pierced ears.        

533
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,200
This is a clip-on one.         

534
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,440
And right next to it...        

535
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,920
This thread from            
Patrick Fuller's jacket.        

536
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,060
Why are you showing them to me?    

537
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:15,280
Julie, we know that sex took place, 
right.                 

538
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,880
Now we're going to ask you       
to do an examination.         

539
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,360
You know, a test.           

540
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:29,000
It won't take them long to       
examine me, Sergeant Bacchus.     

541
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,400
I'm not really a Capricorn.      

542
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,960
I'm a Virgo.              

543
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:48,700
Well, um, er...I don't think we need 
bother with that then, Julie.     

544
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,460
John, why don't you take Julie home? 

545
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,960
Yeah, I'll take you home.       

546
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:59,440
We started work 9.30 in the evening 
and worked through till morning.    

547
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,520
Mr Pershore's doubled our output.   

548
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,380
Where were you working between     
midnight and 1.30? I'll show ya.    

549
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:09,720
I'm sorry, I have to go.        
I'm a lollipop lady.          
The school's are out soon.       

550
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,120
I won't keep you long.         

551
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:15,080
How well did you know         
Patrick Fuller, Mrs Blythely?     

552
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,700
Patrick and Henry were         
best friends, really.         

553
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,960
Henry worked here for Patrick's dad.

554
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,260
I'm sorry, I've really got to go.   
I can't miss work.           

555
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:29,480
I'm afraid I gonna have to       
ask you to be late for work.      

556
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:44,720
Is this where you were working? Aye. 

557
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,900
Well, we know Patrick Fuller      
was dead by 1.30, so...        

558
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,040
where were you between         
midnight and then?           

559
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,340
We were working between here      
and where we feed the grain in.    

560
00:35:56,340 --> 00:36:00,400
Both of you? Well...          

561
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,960
What?                 

562
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:08,080
What? I had an early start on the   
campaign next day so I left early.  

563
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,960
I see. And went where?         

564
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,920
Home. Anybody corroborate that?    

565
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,220
I live on my own since my dad died. 

566
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:21,800
All right. Well, around that time,   
did you see or perhaps hear anything?

567
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,720
Nothing, no.              

568
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,120
Sorry, cos when all this is going...

569
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,760
LOUD MACHINERY                      

570
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,360
I see. Thank you.           

571
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,860
How about you, Mrs Blythely?      

572
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:22,680
I'm in bed by 10.30, 11, so...     

573
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,160
Is it true you had an argument     
with Patrick Fuller yesterday?     

574
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,600
Who told you that, Sam Draper?     

575
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,220
Is it true?              

576
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,800
Yeah.                 

577
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,340
Argument about what?          

578
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:36,760
The way he did his job.        
Or failed to do it.          

579
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,680
You thought you could do it better?  

580
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,540
Anybody could do it better.      

581
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:45,100
So I was telling Patrick Fuller,    
if he didn't get rid of him,      
I'd get Geoff to do it. Geoff?     

582
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,860
Sorry. Mr Pershore. Sorry.       

583
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:51,060
Anyway, Patrick Fuller         
was blind about Draper.        

584
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,300
Like talking to a brick wall.     

585
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:56,140
Sorry, but he wasn't          
all that bright.            

586
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:59,800
Did you say that            
to Patrick Fuller's face? Yeah.    

587
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:05,400
I told him he didn't have the brains
to run a business, and that's how   
come he lost the mill, and Geoff... 

588
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,220
Mr Pershore got it.          
And what was his response?       

589
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,980
He told me to get back to my work.  

590
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,980
My place. Get back to my station.   

591
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,560
Which is presumably          
how the mill used to be run.      

592
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,940
And why it went bust. It's very    
easy to speak ill of the dead.     

593
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,940
He wasn't dead when I said it.     

594
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,820
What do you think, Mr Blythely?    

595
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,720
He was your friend           
and used to be your employer.     

596
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,760
I'll be honest. Patrick and      
I were close for a lot of years,    

597
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,480
but Jed's right. He had no idea    
how to run a business.         

598
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,000
Mr Pershore is streets ahead of him.

599
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,360
Were you close friends at the time   
of his death? How do you mean?     

600
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:46,960
I mean if he had been         
conducting an affair,         
would he have confided in you?     

601
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,560
The thing is,             
since Mr Pershore rescued the mill, 

602
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,440
there's been a lot more work on    
my shoulders, and on Patrick's.    

603
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,400
We didn't see so much of each other 
outside of work as we used to.     

604
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,780
I'm sorry. Did you just say      
"yes" or "no", Mr Blythely?       

605
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,500
I didn't know anything         
about any affair.           

606
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,240
And you?                

607
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,160
Wouldn't have thought         
he had it in him.           

608
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,100
And what about you, Mrs Blythely?   

609
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,040
Affair with who? Julie?        

610
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,680
HE LAUGHS                           
Patrick Fuller in bed with Julie?   

611
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,160
That takes some imagining,       
that does.               

612
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,820
I'm sorry, I have to go.        

613
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:43,000
Sir, the earring. The bloke who    
made it was in Birmingham when we   
were doing the rounds.         

614
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,120
He was buying silver,         
would you believe?           

615
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,680
A jeweller buying silver?       

616
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,240
Knock me down with a feather.     

617
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,240
Go on.                 

618
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,960
So I left a message with him      
and he's just called in.        

619
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,880
He said somebody fitting        
Patrick Fuller's description      

620
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,920
bought a pair of mother of pearl    
earrings like this, But he remembers
because Fuller brought them back    

621
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,560
to get them changed          
from pierced to clip-on ones.     

622
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:11,200
Typical husband, doesn't realise    
his wife's ears aren't pierced. He  
bought another item to go with them.

623
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,880
Well,                 
they didn't cost a thousand quid    
and Julie's got pierced ears, sir.  

624
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,160
I wonder if Mrs Blythely does.     

625
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,800
It shouldn't have happened,      

626
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,680
but it did.              

627
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,540
My husband's best friend.       

628
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,560
But I loved Patrick.          

629
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,320
Very much.               

630
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,920
And your husband?           

631
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,200
Had you stopped loving him?      

632
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,640
Henry is a lot older than me.     

633
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:47,200
He is comfort and companionship...  

634
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,000
What about his wife?          

635
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,120
Sat in that semi-detached morgue    
of a house going            

636
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:55,960
quietly crackers all day because    
she thinks he's knocking Julie off? 

637
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,160
Nice of you to send me to break    
the news to her, by the way.      

638
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,520
Well, I could hardly          
tell her myself, could I?       

639
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,120
I'm not proud of my behaviour,     
Sergeant.               

640
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,240
But love is where it falls. Right.  

641
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,800
I must remember that one.       

642
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,640
Mrs Blythely, what           
happened on the night...?       

643
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,480
Please, don't tell Henry.       

644
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,640
I mean,                
what purpose would it serve now?    

645
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,440
 
I can't promise that, Mrs Blythely.  

646
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,120

What happened on the night that Patrick died?           

647
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:27,860
 
If I knew anything about that night I'd have come forward. I swear.    

648
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:31,900
  
Didn't you swear to love, honour and obey your husband?     

649
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,780

Tell us what you do know.       

650
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,480

Henry was working.           

651
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,740
 
When Henry works you know you won't see him, he's so diligent.    

652
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,760

Patrick would be waiting.       

653
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:52,580
 
We were always so happy in those moments, but maybe there was      

654
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:55,440
...
a sadness in him I didn't see... that I didn't             

655
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,160
 
want to see because he was so lovely. He was so loving.      

656
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,740
...
People think...            

657
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:10,180
 
that passion and love are just for the young, for the beautiful.   

658
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:14,000
 
And I'd said how wonderful Julie looked and she did.          

659
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,180

She looked so young and pretty in those earrings.     

660
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,300

And the scent she wore!        

661
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,440

And Patrick bought them for me.    

662
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,900

Tell me about his sadness.       

663
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:33,460
 
What do lovers say when they know they'll never be together as they should be, as man and wife?

664
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:38,320
 
Because for me to leave Henry and him to leave Brenda...       

665
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:44,460
 ...  
Well, it was never going to happen. So... I mean, he didn't kill himself because of me, did he?     

666
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,920

There was no reason to.        

667
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:54,920
 
As far as you are aware, did anybody at the mill guess about the affair?  

668
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,440
 ...
We always had to be careful.I mean...               

669
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:05,220
 
We tried to avoid each other during the day because we couldn't be near each other without touching.      

670
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,400

People might see.           

671
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,580
  
Who, Mrs Blythely? Who saw?      

672
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,300
 
Nobody. No-one saw.          

673
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,680
...
I mean...               

674
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:22,720
.
There was a time when we thought that Sam Draper might have seen us. 

675
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:27,660
 ...
I thought for a minute he had...    

676
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,760

He didn't see anything.        

677
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,940

When was this?             

678
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:38,420

Three, four months ago.        

679
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:40,980
 
But we were lucky and we were more careful after that.        

680
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,900

Please.                

681
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:48,180

If this has to come out,        

682
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:53,680
-    - 
- can I tell Henry myself? Please.- I'm afraid that won't be possible.  

683
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,960
 
I need you here for the time being.  

684
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:07,940
  
Draper must have caught them together in that office. He must have. He was blackmailing Fuller.   

685
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:10,420

And that is how he got the foreman's job.       

686
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,880

Probably.               

687
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:16,440
 
But Blythely was in the mill for the whole night when Fuller died.   

688
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:22,100

And we're assuming he didn't know about his wife's affair with his best friend.         

689
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:28,800
-   - 
- Maybe he caught them at it that night? - Go and get Draper.     

690
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,040

Mr Draper?          

691
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:49,960
    
Sir ,No sign of Draper but, look, I think he was planning on leaving town.    

692
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,640

You left it too late.         

693
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:52,660

What?                 

694
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:04,980
 
Sir, the serial numbers are in the same sequence as the ones that Pershore showed you.     

695
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:07,180
   
So, Fuller was paying Draper off.                   

696
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:17,820
-    -  
- Have a look. Anything on him? - Just some betting slips, sir.     

697
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:20,720
 
Sir, looks nasty that.         

698
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:24,240

Hasn't been in the water long.     

699
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,400

Entered the river where?        

700
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,120
 
Well, we found some blood up on the corner there, sir.       

701
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,700

Somebody hit him,           

702
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:47,060
 
he fell and hit his head, maybe?    

703
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:49,240
. 
Jed Jimpson, sir?           

704
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,120
 
Possibly. Get him brought in anyway. 

705
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,800

We need to speak to Mr Blythely.    

706
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,700
  
First you lose your boss, then you lose you foreman.       

707
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:04,880
 
Where were you for the last couple of hours, Mr Blythely?     

708
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:05,880

Here.                 

709
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:09,380
-    - 
- Asleep.- Can anybody corroborate that?     

710
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,760
 
As you know, I work nights.      

711
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:13,900

My wife works days.          

712
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:18,200
 
And can you think of anybody who might want Mr Draper dead?     

713
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,320

Where would you like me to start?   

714
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:23,980
 
Give us a couple of minutes, will you?

715
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:26,680
-    - 
- Why?  - Go on.              

716
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:38,460
 .
Well, you could start with the reason Draper was blackmailing Patrick Fuller?      

717
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:41,860
-   -  
- Blackmailing? - Yes. Any idea why?    

718
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,760

How would I?              

719
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,460

Over his affair with your wife, perhaps?        

720
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:51,760

Or are you going to go on pretending you didn't know?      

721
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:55,540

Of course I knew.           

722
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:00,700

I knew almost from the day it started.          

723
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:03,400
-   - 
- Did Patrick Fuller tell you? - No.    

724
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,760
 
I didn't need anybody to tell me, Chief Inspector.       

725
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,800

I could smell it on her.        

726
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:18,260
-   -  
- What? From the perfume he gave her?- No, Mr Gently.             

727
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:23,440

I could smell love on her.       

728
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,600

Happiness.               

729
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,180

He made her happy.           

730
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,080

But you lost your wife and your best friend.         

731
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:45,120
 
I've lost them both for good now, haven't I?        

732
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:54,700
  
Two deaths. A murder and suicide,or two murders.        

733
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:58,560
   
Exactly! I mean, you know, Blythely had a clear motive to kill Fuller.  

734
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:02,180

And what if Draper had decided to blackmail Blythely as well?     

735
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:05,480
" "
"Give us your money or I'll tell everybody that your wife's shagging your best mate".       

736
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:09,060
-   - 
- And, bang, in he goes. - And then there's Jimpson.       

737
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:11,920
 
He was seen rowing with Fuller and he attacked Draper right in front of us.

738
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:16,820
  
Jimpson's not in the digs, sir,or his campaign office.        

739
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:18,720
-   - 
- That was deserted. - Keep looking.    

740
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:24,540
-   -  
- And right in the middle of all this, who have we got? Pershore. - Knight in shining armour. 

741
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:29,320
 .
Mrs Blythely, your lover was being blackmailed by Sam Draper.    

742
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:33,640

So he did see us, then.        

743
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,400
.
And somebody's killed Sam Draper.   

744
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,420

What?                 

745
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:41,960
 .
Obviously it can't have been Patrick Fuller,          

746
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:46,120
.
which makes me wonder if there were other secrets Sam Draper knew about. 

747
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:52,360
-   - 
- Like what? - Were there other parts of his life that Patrick kept hidden?  

748
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:55,300
...
Well...                

749
00:49:55,300 --> 00:50:02,020
   
There was Sunday nights, of course. I mean, they swear to keep that secret, don't they?        

750
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:04,380

Who swears to keep what secret?    

751
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:05,240

The Brotherhood.            

752
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,800

Was Patrick a Mason?          

753
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:18,200
 
Sir, have you ever been asked to roll your trouser leg up?      

754
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,060
 
Many times. You?            

755
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:22,640
 
Yeah. Chief Constable asked if I was interested.       

756
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,960

That was before I got his daughter up the duff.       

757
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,220

Now he hates my guts.         

758
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:30,500
 
Stay away from them. That's my advice.           

759
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,400
-   ...-  
- There harmless enough, sir. It's just...- No, they're not.     

760
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,580
 
They're not. They're not harmless.   

761
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:39,500
 
Police officers should never have a sense of conflicted loyalty. I hate secret societies, anyway.    

762
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:43,600
 
I know one lodge in London got as many crooks in it as coppers.    

763
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:48,420
-  -   
- What does that tell you? - Well, how are we supposed to find out if this Mason thing means anything?    

764
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:53,300
 
We can't just knock on the Mason door and ask if we can come in for a cup of tea, can we?      

765
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:58,800
-   -  
- You can if you've got a search warrant. - Which magistrate's gonna sign that? They'll all be members.  

766
00:50:58,800 --> 00:50:59,320
 
I'll find one.             

767
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:02,360

Well, good luck.            

768
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,720

Just get after Jimpson.        

769
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:08,940
 
All right.I'll get the lads onto it.       

770
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,300
 .
Do we know where Geoffrey Pershore is, by the way?        

771
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:14,960
 
Yeah, he's still busy setting up the People's Republic of Durham.    

772
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:15,380

Why?                  

773
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:21,820
 
When he was looking at the contents of his safe, I felt he was expecting something else to be there.      

774
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:24,800
-   - 
- Like what? - I don't know.        

775
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,860
-   -  -  
- What did you do with the account books for the mill, by the way? - Me? - Yeah.               

776
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,320
-   -  
- No. Pershore said that Fuller took them home. - Yes, so he did.    

777
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,300

Did you go back and get them?     

778
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:39,480
-  -   
- You didn't ask us to. D'you seriously expect to swan off to London and do a course     

779
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:43,700
 
on police methods when you haven't even grasped the basics? Go and get them.  

780
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:49,580

Bloody useless little...        

781
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:54,400
. 
Mary Blythely? She's plain as a pikestaff.      

782
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,260

That's even worse.           

783
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:01,920
17 
I could understand the 17-year-old moron...        

784
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:02,760

Yeah.              

785
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:05,700

Love is where it falls.        

786
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:08,400
-   - 
- So they say. - So who says?       

787
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,900
...
Erm...                 

788
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:14,860
.
Mary Blythely, actually.        

789
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:16,680

790
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:20,780
- .   - 
- Sam Draper, Mrs Fuller. - Who's he?   

791
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:23,100

He wasn't having him as well, was he?

792
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:23,800
 
No                

793
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,460

He made him foreman of the mill.    

794
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:30,600
 
He was taken from the river this morning. Almost certainly murdered. 

795
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:35,140
-  - 
- Murdered? - We believe he was blackmailing your husband over the affair.     

796
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:40,200
 
Mrs Fuller, can we talk about your husband's money problems?     

797
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,340
-   - 
- That's none of my business. - You never asked about it?       

798
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:44,920

Yeah.                 

799
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:48,920
-   - 
- And? - It's none of my business.     

800
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,540

So now what you going to tell me?   

801
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:54,180

That he was a thief as well?      

802
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:59,380
 
You said that your husband came home and he went straight to his study.  

803
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:01,780
 
Would you mind if I had a look? 

804
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,900

It's through here.           

805
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:26,640
 
Not my strong point,debit and credit and whatnot...    

806
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:31,680
 
Are you married, Sergeant Bacchus?   

807
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:33,060
                  
808
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:35,320

Where's your wife right now?      
      

809
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,360

At this very moment?          

810
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:44,640
   
I dunno. Shopping,mowing the lawn, I dunno.       

811
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,700

Exactly.                

812
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,200

You don't know.            

813
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:51,520

None of us knows.           

814
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:04,700
 
I used to do accountancy. That's how I met Patrick.       

815
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,340

He was copying them.          

816
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:22,280
 
No, he was adjusting and copying them.           

817
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:26,360

So he was a thief as well.       

818
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:31,000
 
We know nothing about our own lives,Sergeant.               

819
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:34,400

We live with strangers.        

820
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:40,860
  
I'm going to have to take these.Yes, that's fine.           

821
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:50,700
 
Yes, the mafia of the mediocre.    

822
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,560

Despicable men.            

823
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,400

My husband was a Mason.        

824
00:54:56,100 --> 00:55:01,500
  
They were phoning him all the time, putting more and more pressure on him. Pressure about what?      

825
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,200

Well, what do you think?        

826
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:06,880
 
I don't know. The election!      

827
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:13,680
 
The masons are all Tories and their bete noire, Mr Pershore,is threatening to win their seat.   

828
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:21,180
 
So Patrick had Pershore coming from one side and the Masons from the other,       

829
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:25,060

led by that prize idiot Mundy and his little lap dog.     

830
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:27,700
 
Nicholas Mundy? The Tory candidate? 

831
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:32,220
 
Yes, the one who rides to hounds and passes himself off as a country squire.        

832
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:35,140
 
Oh, I'm sure he'll agree to see us, Mrs Fuller.         

833
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:38,720
" "
'Patrick had stopped going to the lodge, so they came to see him.'    

834
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:42,720
 
Let's continue our talk about Geoffrey Pershore. Is there somewhere private?

835
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:49,340
   
And what did they want? For goodness sake, wake up, Sergeant.   

836
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:51,520

What do you think this is?       

837
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,080
""
"The best man wins"?          

838
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,740

They wanted something to bury Geoffrey Pershore with.      

839
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:58,140

And they were determined to get it from Patrick.        

840
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:17,820

I've managed to persuade your father-in-law to spare you a few minutes.           

841
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:21,280
  
Listen, pal. You're just the dog that guards his door.         

842
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,920

Don't get carried away with yourself.             

843
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,740
 
I must warn you though, he's in a foul temper.         

844
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:30,140

He's just had lunch with his daughter.           

845
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,700

Right.                 

846
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,200

Thanks.                

847
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:50,320
 
Good afternoon, sir.          

848
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:53,500
 
Thanks for letting me see you so quickly. What do you want?     

849
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:59,600
 
Well, two things, really.       

850
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:02,040
 ...
Number one? Number one...       

851
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,260

HE CLEARS HIS THROAT                

852
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:09,740

Could I get the constabulary's permission to attend a training seminar in London?           

853
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:12,880
  ... 
It's a fascinating course, sir, which... Granted. Number two?     

854
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:21,200
 ...
Yeah, the second thing is...a favour.             

855
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:28,580
"" 
"Adjusting". What does that mean?   

856
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:31,960
"" 
I think its accountancy talk for fiddling the books.        

857
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:36,760

So, what did they think that Fuller had on Geoffrey Pershore to discredit him?  

858
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:39,260
 
Dunno. But now he's dead.       

859
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:42,020
  ...
We know he's a Mason, I think it's important that we...       

860
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:47,540
    
No, the masons are a dead end. Masons only trust other Masons, they don't trust you or me. Fine.   

861
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:50,480
  
Fine. You know best. Yes. I do.    

862
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:54,400
  20
It's odd, isn't it? Must be something to do with 20 years as a detective.  

863
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:58,540
 
During which time, by the way, I never attended any seminars on modern policing.      

864
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:00,760
 
Yeah. You've made your point about that.         

865
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:03,580
  
Good. So I don't need to hear about it again? No.      

866
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:07,260
 
Not a word. Excellent!         

867
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,980

Geoffrey Pershore's making a speech tonight.        

868
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:13,600

I think we should go and listen.    

869
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,580

Why?                  

870
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:19,660
 
Because we haven't found Jed Jimpson yet. He might be there.    

871
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:22,460
 
I can't. Why not?           

872
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:25,340

Because I've got something I need to do.             

873
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:27,820
 
Something important. Like what?    

874
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:30,040

I said I'd take the wife out.     

875
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,080
...
I missed her anniversary and...    

876
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,700

Our anniversary.            

877
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:38,540

And she'll skin me alive if I say I'm working late again.    

878
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:42,540
   
Well. That is important, John. So I'll go alone.           

879
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:45,120
... 
Oh... Oh, right.            

880
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,440
 ...
Are you sure? I feel bad...      

881
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,940
     
No, no, no, don't feel bad. Your wife is your support system, John.   

882
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:54,000
 
You go and buy her a nice dinner. Thank you.

Now, remember the slogan, a very important slogan..."on Thursday, vote Mundy".

Ah, hello. I am your Conservative candidate. Detective Chief Inspector Gently.   

886
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,940

Have you got a moment?         

887
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:15,840
 
Surely. It concerns Patrick Fuller. 

888
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,940
...
Patrick Fuller... Er?         

889
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:20,620

The man who hanged himself out at Rinton Mill.          

890
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:28,440
   
Whose house you visited last week.Ah! I'm sorry, my mind's a sieve at the moment.             

891
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,660
 
Awful business. Awful.         

892
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:33,740
... 
How's dear erm... Mrs Fuller holding up?         

893
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:35,520

Not particularly well.         

894
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:38,960
 
So? Why did you visit him?       

895
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,020
 
Well, it's courtesy.

He's a valued member of the local party - thanking those who put in the effort.              

897
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:47,660
 
and I had not an inkling of what was to come, shocking.     

898
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:50,480
 
His wife said you put him under pressure. Mr Mundy, sir.     

899
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,460
 
Yes, just a couple of minutes.     

900

Sorry, pressure? What sort of pressure?         

901
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:57,980
  
That's what I'm asking you. Mr Mundy.We really must be moving on.

Chief Inspector, would it be possible to carry on this after the election tomorrow?        

904
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,980

Now would be better.          

905
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:14,740
 
Are you seriously expecting me to halt my electoral campaign at this crucial stage, Chief Inspector?  

906
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:19,000
 
No. I'll talk to you on Friday.    

907
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,480

Thank you.               

908
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,740
  
Hello. I'm Nicholas Mundy.I'm your Conservative candidate.    

909
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:25,700

Are you "blue through and through"?      

910
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:50,540
    
Now, I'll need all metal objects watches, rings, etc. Right.      

911
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:54,500

912
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:57,640
  
OK. I'm Maurice, by the way.Maurice Hilton.            

913
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,620

Haven't learnt how to do that yet.  

914
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:01,620

HE LAUGHS                           

915
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:16,820
#1500
#1,500.                

916
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:21,020
4000
4,000 quid gone where?         

917
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:25,980
...
Oh...                 

918
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:54,900

This is a wonderful journey you're embarking on.          

919
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,000

Ready?                 

920
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,520

Yeah.                 

921
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:29,420
   
Whom have you there? Mr John Bacchus,a poor candidate in a state of darkness,humbly soliciting

922
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:34,020
 
to be admitted to the mysteries and privileges of Freemasonry.    

923
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:36,620

Do you feel anything?         

924
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:38,340
 
Yes, I do, actually.          

925
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:57,220
 
Mr John Bacchus, are you willing to take a solemn obligation      

926
01:02:57,220 --> 01:03:01,220

to keep inviolate the secrets and mysteries of the order?      

927
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:03,900
...
Um... Yes!               

928
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:19,340

What happened?             

929
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:21,380

Mr Pershore had to cancel.       

930
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:23,420

He's indisposed.            

931
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:25,700
  
Do you know a Jed Jimpson? Yeah. Is he here?           

932
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:27,340

Haven't seen him since yesterday.   

933
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:29,020

OK, thank you.             

934
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:30,940

Chief Inspector Gently.        

935
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:33,020

We meet at last.            

936
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:34,620

I'm Lisa.               

937
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:37,780
 
Lisa Bacchus. John's wife.       

938
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:41,440

I saw your photo in the paper a while back.             

939
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:46,300
  
I, John Bacchus, of my own free will do solemnly promise and swear.     

940
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:52,800
 
Under no less a penalty than that of having my throat cut across from ear to ear.            

941
01:03:55,300 --> 01:04:00,060
 
Under no less a penalty than that of having my throat cut across from ear to ear. 

942
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:06,780

That I will not reveal the secrets or mysteries belonging to the Free and Accepted Masons.

943
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:13,700

That I will never reveal the secrets or mysteries belonging to Free and Accepted Masons.      

944
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:16,700
 
He's not with you tonight then? No. 

945
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:22,820
 
When he rings to say he's working late I automatically blame it on you. 

946
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:24,300

Sorry.                 

947
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:30,740
 "  "
Sometimes I say to him, "John,why don't you just go and marry Mr Gently, you might as well."     

948
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:32,820

He's married to you.          

949
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:35,260
 
Aye, but he prefers your company.   

950
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:38,160
 
No, that's OK. You're nice.      

951
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:42,500

Can I tell you something?       

952
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,700

Yeah.                 

953
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:46,500

I don't really like policemen.     

954
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:48,860

They're all I've grown up with.    

955
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:51,620

Any party, any gathering,       

956
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:54,300
 
even my wedding. Policemen.      

957
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:58,580
  
Standing in a huddle, laughing at jokes the rest of us don't get.Leaving us out. 

958
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:06,740
  "" 
I watched my mother cope with it and said, "Right, definitely not marrying a policeman." But...   

959
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:07,960

But you got pregnant.         

960
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:13,140
  
Is that what he told you? Yeah, I got pregnant,         

961
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:16,540

but we were gonna get married anyway.          

962
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:18,660

I love him.              

963
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:22,180
    
Is that what he told you? No, no, no, I got that bit wrong.   

964
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:25,940
 
John keeps his private life private. Keeps a lot private.          

965
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:28,140

Guess what I found out this week?   

966
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:30,080

Votes Tory.              

967
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,380

968
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:35,420
-   -   
- Not you, then?  - No, I want Pershore to win.      

969
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:38,900
 
I saw him talking in the market last weekend. I think he's great.   

970
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:40,900

Do you trust him?           

971
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:42,380

Yeah.                 

972
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:46,780
...
I better go...rescue me mother.

- She's babysitting. Nice meeting you,Mr Gently. - George.- George.       

974
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:54,940
 
George? Am I losing my husband?    

975
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:01,460
-    - 
- He's not working late tonight,is he? - I don't know where he is.    

976
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:18,980
. 
John Bacchus, you have been brought into the wisdom and light of Masonry.              

977
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:22,200

978
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:28,660

Well done.               

979
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:31,860
-    - 
- Yes, sir. - John!

Sir!                  

981
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:38,580
 
If I have one more tearful lunch with my daughter on account of you,  

982
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:41,820
 
then I shall remove your balls and post them to you. Understood?   

983
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:43,580
"" 
Say "yes" and smile.

- Yes. Thank you. Understood.- Edgar.  

985

- Edgar. - And if you ever call me Edgar outside of this lodge, then I shall mince them before I post them to you.

986

- "" -   -  
- Say thank you. - Thank you, Edgar. - Now,go and meet your new brothers.

987
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:02,580
 
So, John, there's "trouble at mill!"

988
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:07,220

Obviously nothing you say goes outside these walls.     

989
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:12,680
    
But, um, Pershore's got both tits in the mangle, I hear? Eh, Maurice? 

990
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:15,740
 
What do you do, Maurice?        

991
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:18,900
  
Maurice does as he's told.Don't you, Maurice?          

992
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:23,580
-   -  
- I have to go.- Have another drink, Maurice.      

993
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:25,500
 
Brother John's on our side, aren't you?           

994
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:29,680
-    - 
- 100% there, Nicholas. - I have to go. 

995
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:37,780

Was it something I said?        

996
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:42,700
- ...  - 
- Maurice has erm...divided loyalties.I suspect he has grounds        

997
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:45,900

to shut down the mill but I think he's a Liberal at heart.    

998
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:50,100
 
The thing is, Maurice may not look like much, but he could      

999
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:53,680
  
bury Pershore for us and save the seat tomorrow. Just like that.  

1000
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:01,940
 
Maurice, you all right?        

1001
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:03,460
  
Yes. Absolutely fine. Thanks.     

1002
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:07,520

So what do you make of us then?    

1003
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,420

What do I make of you?         

1004
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:14,100

I think you're all a bunch of crooks.           

1005
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:18,140
 
So what is it you do for a living then, Maurice?        

1006
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:19,740
 
We don't ask each other, you know.  

1007
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:21,940

Right.                 

1008
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:25,300

Answer the question.          

1009
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:29,020
 
That has absolutely no authority inside these walls.          

1010
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:30,620

Fine.                 

1011
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:32,180

Let's go down the station then.

- I'm not obliged to say anything without the advice of a solicitor.- Then let's go down to the bar,

20
must be about 20 of them in there.

What is it they want from you, Maurice?           

1015
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:50,140

What is it they wanted from Patrick Fuller? What is it that you know that can bury Pershore like that?   

1016
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:52,160

How can you close the mill down?    

1017
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:56,100

Is it something to do with flour?   

1018
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:57,940

Are you a health inspector?      

1019
01:09:00,820 --> 01:09:02,540

So, what's it to be then?       

1020
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:04,780
 
Here, now, in the bar?         

1021
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:06,880

Or in the morning in my office?    

1022
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:11,900
 
Fine. What time?

Ah, you know.             

1025
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:35,260

Work.

Working with Mr Gently?

Yeah.

The dogs are barking tonight.

Fast asleep.

- Where have you been, John? -I've told you. - You didn't actually. 

1035
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:10,140
 
Before you lie,I saw George tonight.         

1036
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:12,660
- ...  - 
- George? My... - Your boss.        

1037
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:14,340
 
Lovely man, by the way.        

1038
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:16,600

Can tell why you talk about him so much now.         

1039
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:20,580
 
Asked him where you were.       

1040
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:22,180

He didn't know.            

1041
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:25,900

Think he didn't want to lie.      

1042
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:28,060
 
So, who is she?            

1043
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:32,620
   ...
Oh, come on, Lis, I'm not...      

1044
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:38,100
-   - 
- I'm really tired. - I'm tired as well.

1045
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:41,180
 
So start telling the truth or we can call it a day.        

1046
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:43,260
 
I was with your dad, all right!    

1047
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:47,700

I was at the Mason's.         

1048
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:49,200

You're not a Mason.          

1049
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:53,740
-    -  
- Well, I am now, why don't you go and telephone your dad and ask him, OK? - No, it's not OK.            

1050
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:57,060
 
Why are we married, John?       

1051
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:59,140

The truth.               

1052
01:10:59,140 --> 01:11:01,620

Why did you marry me?         

1053
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:03,740

Because...               

1054
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:09,520
  
because your dad said he'd ruin my career if I didn't do the decent thing by you.      

1055
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:13,740

And I wanted to.            

1056
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:18,500
  
I wanted to do the right thing for you, both of you. You and Leanne.   

1057
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:20,740
"" 
You haven't used the word "love", John.         

1058
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:25,580

Lisa...                

1059
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:31,420
 
I don't think I even know who you are, really.       

1060
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:34,880

We live with strangers.        

1061
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:36,420

What?                 

1062
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:41,060
 
A woman said to me today that we live with strangers.        

1063
01:11:42,620 --> 01:11:45,420
 
Well, I can't live with a stranger, John.         

1064
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:48,260

It doesn't have to be like that.    

1065
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:53,040

Goodnight.               

1066
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:22,780

You have a very sweet wife.      

1067
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:24,700

She thinks you're nice and all.    

1068
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:27,300
  
Where were you, by the way?      

1069
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:35,940
-   - 
- Masonic lodge. - What?          

1070
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:37,520
 
I joined the Masons, sir.       

1071
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:43,140

Why don't you ask me why I joined the Masons?        

1072
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:45,820
-   -   
- I think I'm starting to get the picture. - No, sir. I...       

1073
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:49,280
-   - 4 
- You're not getting the picture at all. - He's in Room 4, Sarge.     

1074
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,980
-   - 
- Who is? - All right.           

1075
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:54,060
- 4  -  
- Who's in room 4?! - I'm telling you, if you give me a bloody minute!    

1076
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:57,020
.
His name is Maurice Hilton.      

1077
01:12:57,020 --> 01:13:02,500
. 
He's the man that went with Mundy to see Patrick Fuller shortly before he died. He's a food safety inspector  

1078
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:07,280
  
and I found him. I found him by joining the Masons, sir.      

1079
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:17,780
6 4
#4,000 was withdrawn from the Rinton Mill bank account six months ago.            

1080
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:19,340

And?                  

1081
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:21,080

Vanished into thin air.        

1082
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:32,920
 
Mr Hilton, you know how this goes.   

1083
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:39,100
.
I intend to investigate every contact in connection between yourself and Patrick Fuller.      

1084
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:41,620
.
And Geoffrey Pershore.         

1085
01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:45,920

You should also know the fraud squad will be looking into your bank accounts.        

1086
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:49,260
 
I'm sorry, may I get a glass of water?         

1087
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:51,120
 
Not at the moment, no.         

1088
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:58,460

This was done with the best intentions on everyone's part.     

1089
01:13:58,460 --> 01:14:01,900

My team carried out it's annual inspection of the mill.        

1090
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:04,540

The place was decrepit.        

1091
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:07,700
 
Dirty in places, if not filthy.    

1092
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:09,260

Rat droppings.             

1093
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:14,460
. 
I told Patrick Fuller I'd have to issue a closure order.  

1094
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:16,740
 
But the mill didn't close, did it?   

1095
01:14:16,740 --> 01:14:18,300

It stayed open.            

1096
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:21,580
 
Well, it was a fellow Mason. Closing the mill would've ruined him.     

1097
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:25,660
 
Yeah. So you did the decent thing to help your brother Mason?   

1098
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:27,460
  
No, no, it wasn't like that.      

1099
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:31,380
.
Geoffrey Pershore had just bought the mill.       

1100
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:33,740

He was promising to modernise the place.          

1101
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:38,180
""
Saying, "Why make all these people redundant when we could create jobs?"      

1102
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:40,500
 
Put things right...and he did.     

1103
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,980
 
I mean, he's totally transformed the mill.         

1104
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:45,140

The place is a model of cleanliness now.          

1105
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:49,620
. 
How much did Geoffrey Pershore pay you to forget about the closure notice?       

1106
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:51,260

Nowt.                 

1107
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:53,680

I was doing it for the greater good.

1108
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:56,660

I'm a public servant.         

1109
01:14:56,660 --> 01:15:02,100
...
So...if I was to look back over your bank records.        

1110
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:05,540
4
I wouldn't find a payment for #4,000.

1111
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:10,260
  
What did you buy, Maurice? New house?               

1112
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:14,180
 
What happened, Maurice?        

1113
01:15:14,180 --> 01:15:20,460
.5
The date that the 4,000 went missing from the bank account was five months

1114
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:24,020
4
after Geoffrey Pershore had bought and modernised the mill.  

1115
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:25,920

So what did he pay you for?      

1116
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:30,660

There was an outbreak of food poisoning.           

1117
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:33,060

In Rinton.               

1118
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:36,580
19
19 people were hospitalised.      

1119
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:39,620

I traced the source back to the mill.           

1120
01:15:39,620 --> 01:15:42,940
 
Look, it was before Pershore's reforms had kicked in.         

1121
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:45,640

I should have made him stop production when I...       

1122
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:49,860
-    - 
- I didn't. - I remember this now.     

1123
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:53,980
 
Yeah, you blamed a Chinese chippy for the outbreak, didn't you?     

1124
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:55,540
 
Yeah, it deserved to be closed.    

1125
01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:57,580

I found half a goat in the fridge once.          

1126
01:15:57,580 --> 01:16:00,760

Scapegoat, was it?          

1127
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:07,420

So the mill was never publicly blamed for the outbreak?   

1128
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:13,260
-   - 19 
- No. - So what happened to the 19 people who were never told the truth about how they became ill?    

1129
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:15,040

They all recovered.          

1130
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:18,940

All except one of them.        

1131
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:21,020

And who was that?           

1132
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:26,580
40 6
A man in his forties. Six months later died of complications.      

1133
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:30,460
 
Liver failure. Look,no-one could have foreseen that.    

1134
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:33,580
 4
And that was when you were paid the #4,000 for your silence?      

1135
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:38,260
 
Yes?And Pershore got the closure notice. 

1136
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:39,600

What did he do with it?        

1137
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:43,100

Said he'd keep it under lock and key.          

1138
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:46,400

He said it was his insurance policy.

1139
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:49,260

In case I ever decided to reveal the truth.          

1140
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:54,220
- .  -  
- And Nicholas Mundy?- I stupidly told him half the story one night at the lodge bar.      

1141
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:59,660
-     - 
- And ever since he's been pressurising you to get the story in the papers.- Aye.       

1142
01:16:59,660 --> 01:17:03,740
 
This man who died. What's his name?  

1143
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,960
 
How can they just print lies, Geoff?

1144
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,200
  
That scumbag Mundy and his friends in high places.      

1145
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:17,480
-    - 
- They were never going to let me win.Jed. - But it's rubbish anyway.     

1146
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:19,880

What's Fuller's suicide got to do with anything?        

1147
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:23,040
   
It's not Fuller, Jed, it's Draper.They'll get me for Draper.       

1148
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,040
 
They won't, I won't let them.     

1149
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:28,800
  
You'll keep your mouth shut, Jed.You have a future.           

1150
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:35,640
  
Ah, we've been looking for you, Jed.

1151
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:39,640
   
Salutations, gentlemen.Pour our guests a drink, Jed.     

1152
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:41,280
 
None for me, thank you.        

1153
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:42,400

Thank you.               

1154
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:46,280

Not going to the count?        

1155
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:48,020

I'll head down in a while.       

1156
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:54,160
-   - 
- How's it going? - Still optimistic.   

1157
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:58,080
 
What can I do for you,Chief Inspector?            

1158
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:00,880

I'm afraid I've come to arrest you.  

1159
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:03,480

Doing the Tories dirty work for them?          

1160
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:06,200
-   - 
- Jed. - On what charge?          

1161
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,960
.
Bribing Maurice Hilton.        

1162
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:12,040
- .  - 
Who's Maurice Hilton?Will you shut your face, please?    

1163
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:15,320
. 
Maurice Hilton is a food inspector, Jed.       

1164
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:18,920
 
He should have closed down Rinton Mill but he didn't.       

1165
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:22,280
4
Mr Pershore gave him #4,000.      

1166
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:26,800
-   -   
- Nonsense. - Look, Hilton's coughed,you might as well do the same.     

1167
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:30,600
-   -  
- Otherwise we're gonna be here all night. - What's your evidence,Mr Gently?               

1168
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,680
.
Maurice Hilton's confession.      

1169
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:35,160

His word against mine, then.      

1170
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:39,000
 
You didn't do it! He's had smears against him all his life, man.     

1171
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,080
-   - 
- There's always someone wanting money off him.- I wonder why.

1172
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:44,440

Because he won't kowtow to the system.             

1173
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:45,880

He wants to change it.         

1174
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:50,680
-    - 
- Really? Where were you Tuesday morning, then? - He was with me all day out on the knocker.      

1175
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:52,740
.
Sam Draper.              

1176
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:55,840

What about him?            

1177
01:18:55,840 --> 01:19:00,600
....
Sam Draper was blackmailing Patrick Fuller over his affair with Mary Blythely.       

1178
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:06,060

Fuller paid him off with bank notes in the same sequence as the ones you showed me.       

1179
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:08,480
 
Well, if that's true, it's terrible.

1180
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:12,480
 
What else was missing from the safe, Mr Pershore?      

1181
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,800
 
Apart from the petty cash. Nothing.  

1182
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:19,840
""
Nothing except what you called your insurance policy.         

1183
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:23,800

Hilton's closure notice on the mill. 

1184
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:28,880
- 4  - 
- The document that you bought from Hilton for #4,000. - What?     

1185
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:32,360
  
It's not true, Jed. The document Draper took from the safe when     

1186
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:35,920

he went looking for the blackmail money that Fuller promised him.    

1187
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:41,400
 
Which Fuller never handed over,of course, because he decided to hang himself and have done with it all.   

1188
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:47,480
 
So are you telling me that Draper didn't come and offer you that document to buy back?     

1189
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:51,080
-   -  -  ""
- You said...- Jed. - What? "You said" what?      

1190
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:02,200
. 
Did you kill Sam Draper, Mr Pershore?

1191
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:03,840

Of course I didn't.          

1192
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:09,400
  
Well, I think you did. I can establish a very firm motive and you're unwilling to provide an alibi.

1193
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:11,400
 
Never stand up in a court of law.   

1194
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:15,400
 
But it'll be the end of your political ambitions, wouldn't it?   

1195
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:18,000
  
Ah. What's wrong, Jed?         

1196
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,120

Hero's got feet of clay, has he?    

1197
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:22,440

You said...              

1198
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:25,400
...
you told me that it was...       

1199
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,180
 
Told you what, Jed?          

1200
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:34,240
 .
He told me that the money was to stop Draper from hurting Henry Blythely.        

1201
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:36,720

What money?              

1202
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:39,720
 
What's going on, Geoff?        

1203
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:44,120
   
Oh, here he is. Your bum boy.Come to help him with his seat, have you?

1204
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:47,320
   
Keep out of it, Jed. It's finished.Draper's no longer in my employ.    

1205
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:49,600
 
Clear off, Draper.           

1206
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,800
 ""
You. Don't tell me to clear off.    

1207
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:56,480
   
Mr Fancy Pants! You remember,I'll come back whenever I like.    

1208
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:58,520

I've got your nuts in my hand!     

1209
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:01,320
 
Figure of speech, like, bum boy.    

1210
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:03,800

1211
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:05,680
 
Jed! No!                

1212
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:17,980

Geoff...                

1213
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:22,080
 
Geoff... I think he's dead.      

1214
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:41,380

Quick.                 

1215
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:58,520
 
What happened next, Jed?        

1216
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:03,720

Geoff drove me home and...       

1217
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:05,920

Straight home?             

1218
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:08,160

Or did you stop off somewhere else?  

1219
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:17,600
 
We stopped outside Draper's house and Geoff went in for a while.     

1220
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:20,700

You went in to get the closure notice.          

1221
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:22,320

And you destroyed it.         

1222
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:25,140
1
I should've burnt it a year ago.    

1223
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:28,380

Some insurance policy.         

1224
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:33,040
 
But I did it. I killed Draper.     

1225
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:35,880

Geoff's innocent.           

1226
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,300

Is he?                 

1227
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:43,000
 
Are you going to let him do this,Mr Pershore?              

1228
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,040

Go on thinking you're innocent.    

1229
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:53,280
  
There was a local outbreak of food poisoning, Jed, about a year ago.   

1230
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:56,560
-   - 
- Do you remember it? - Vaguely.      

1231
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:59,240

Did your father contract it?      

1232
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:01,120

He was an alcoholic.          

1233
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:02,880

He contracted everything.       

1234
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:04,680

He was useless.            

1235
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:07,720

This was a particularly severe outbreak.            

1236
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:10,080

Source was traced to the mill.     

1237
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:14,520
 
A man died of complications from it about six months ago.     

1238
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:17,060

He died of liver failure.       

1239
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,240

Me dad?                

1240
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:32,800
 
I wanted to make it up to you, Jed. 

1241
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:36,920

I made one stupid mistake.       

1242
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:39,180

In the public interest.        

1243
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:43,160
 
I wanted to keep the mill going while I cleaned it up.         

1244
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:45,480

I made a mistake.           

1245
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:50,920

You talk about fairness?        

1246
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:55,040
" "
You talk about truth and honesty and changing the world?!

1247
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:59,800
 
You're a crook,just another crooked businessman!   

1248
01:24:07,140 --> 01:24:09,520
 
I tried to give you your dad back, Jed.          

1249
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:13,120

Was I wrong?              

1250
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:20,000

Oi!                  

1251
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:26,240

I don't...need...a dad.        

1252
01:24:27,580 --> 01:24:29,900

Jed.                  

1253
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:31,440

Is he worth hanging for?        

1254
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:56,160

I should be getting to the count.   

1255
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:02,760

How do you do good in life?      

1256
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:05,720

Do you know?              

1257
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:10,720
 
How, without taking chances?      

1258
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:13,580

You mean making compromises?      

1259
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:15,880
 
I didn't compromise,I took a chance.            

1260
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:18,040

And not for me...           

1261
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:20,720

for the good of the mill and its workers.            

1262
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:26,360
-   - 
- And you're going to go on telling yourself that, are you? - Till I die.  

1263
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:36,820

The Returning Officer for the constituency of Rinton.    

1264
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:38,780

Have I missed it?           

1265
01:25:38,780 --> 01:25:43,540
-   - 
- Any minute now. - The reported count for each candidate was as follows.

1271
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:13,000

What would you think Jimpson will get?  

1272
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:16,840
 
Manslaughter. 3, 4 years.       

1273
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:20,140
 
Generous of you to let Pershore come to the count.           

1274
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:22,680

I'd have locked him up straight away.           

1275
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,640
 
Thank you. Thank you very much.    

1276
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:39,680

I'm beginning to see why you don't vote.          

1277
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:42,280

Lies everywhere you look.       

1278
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:46,380
 
It's the lies you tell yourself that kill you.             

1279
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:48,360

Why London?              

1280
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,960

Career move.              

1281
01:26:54,820 --> 01:26:58,240
  
Chief Constable put a note on my desk, by the way.        

1282
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:03,960

My objections to your going for the Met have been over-ruled, apparently.

1283
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:08,540
 
Have you worked out yet why he's so keen for you to go on this seminar? 

1284
01:27:08,540 --> 01:27:12,280
 
Yep. He's hoping I won't come back. 

1285
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:13,760

And will you?             

1286
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:19,280
 
How do you resign from the Masons,by the way?              

1287
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:23,800
   
You don't. You know you've left the Masons when they find you.  

1288
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:27,320

Great.                 

1289
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:34,040
 
Good luck, Sergeant Bacchus.      

1290
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:35,040
 
Thank you, guv.
