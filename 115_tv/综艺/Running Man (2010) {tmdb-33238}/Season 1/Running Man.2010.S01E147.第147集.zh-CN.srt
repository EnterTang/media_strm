1
00:00:03,201 --> 00:00:04,744
前情提要
Previously on Future Man...

2
00:00:04,827 --> 00:00:06,663
我们要速战速决  启动伽玛预案
This is a rush job, Gamma protocol.

3
00:00:06,746 --> 00:00:09,666
她的小脑瓜还有26分钟就爆炸了
Her little head's going to blow in 26 minutes!

4
00:00:09,749 --> 00:00:11,918
我发现了追溯到
I discovered a whole branch to my family tree

5
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:13,336
几百年前的一个家族分支
going back hundreds of years.

6
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:14,963
你到底对虎有多少了解
What do you really know about Tiger?

7
00:00:15,046 --> 00:00:16,589
对这所谓的反抗组织有多少了解
About the socalled Resistance?

8
00:00:16,673 --> 00:00:18,091
她根本不在乎婴儿
She doesn't care about babies.

9
00:00:18,174 --> 00:00:19,610
她没有家人
She doesn't have a family of her own.

10
00:00:19,634 --> 00:00:21,719
她和任何人任何东西都没有联系
She's not connected to anyone or anything.

11
00:00:21,803 --> 00:00:23,155
我都被你们整糊涂了
I'm getting very confused right now.

12
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:25,598
别听她的  她生来就被设定成蛊惑人心 
Don't listen to her, okay?  She is programmed to deceive.

13
00:00:30,687 --> 00:00:33,064
卡素是以詹姆斯·卡梅隆命名的吗
Cameronium is named after James Cameron?

14
00:00:33,147 --> 00:00:36,317
你刚告诉了我何时何该如何
You just told me how, when, and where

15
00:00:36,401 --> 00:00:38,194
去获得更多的卡素
to get more Cameronium.

16
00:00:38,278 --> 00:00:40,196
我要为他们的未来而战
I'm fighting for their future.

17
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,573
不是你的
Not yours.

18
00:00:41,656 --> 00:00:43,783
所以你在接下来的30秒里
So why don't you contemplate that

19
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:47,078
好好思考吧
in the next 30 sec...

20
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:04,030
好了
Okay.

21
00:02:04,113 --> 00:02:05,114
就是这里
This is it.

22
00:02:05,198 --> 00:02:06,866
我们跳进去  找到实验室
We jump in, find the lab,

23
00:02:06,949 --> 00:02:08,076
拿到卡素
grab the Cameronium,

24
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:10,703
在这过程中别杀了詹姆斯·卡梅隆
and don't kill James Cameron in the process.

25
00:02:10,787 --> 00:02:12,955
我从没见你那么专注过
I've never seen you this focused.

26
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:15,375
我们出发前你充过电吗
Did you get a charge in before we left?

27
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,210
XXX
Little necro charge?

28
00:02:17,293 --> 00:02:19,379
什么  还有这回事
What? That's a thing?

29
00:02:19,462 --> 00:02:21,589
- 太变态了  - 不是
- That's fucked up.  - No!

30
00:02:22,965 --> 00:02:24,926
听着  我只是想
Listen, I'm just trying to get you two out of here

31
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:27,428
在生化人还没来  造成损害或是好事前
before the Biotics arrive and start causing

32
00:02:27,512 --> 00:02:29,514
把你们俩送走
either harm or... or good,

33
00:02:29,597 --> 00:02:32,016
我真的不能再确定了
I really can't be sure anymore.

34
00:02:34,644 --> 00:02:36,562
虎她人呢
Where the hell is Tiger?

35
00:02:55,998 --> 00:02:58,418
- 你去哪了  - 我刚让一个陌生人
- Where were you?  - I was just having a stranger

36
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:00,378
用她的小嘴含着我的老二
put a rat hole around my penis

37
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:02,588
在我本应执行干扰行动的时候
when I was supposed to be running an interference op.

38
00:03:02,672 --> 00:03:04,590
不好意思  那是你
I'm sorry, that was you.

39
00:03:04,674 --> 00:03:06,175
那叫口交
It's called a blowjob,

40
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:09,137
而且我绝不会为此道歉
and I'm never apologizing for it.

41
00:03:10,471 --> 00:03:12,140
你应该意识到  如果这不起作用
You do realize that if this doesn't work,

42
00:03:12,223 --> 00:03:15,601
我们就会被困在2023年  回不来了
we're stuck in the year 2023 and there's no coming back.

43
00:03:15,685 --> 00:03:18,062
说实话  经历了今晚的事后
Honestly, after everything that happened tonight,

44
00:03:18,146 --> 00:03:19,939
我真的无所谓了
I really don't give a shit.

45
00:03:20,022 --> 00:03:21,941
开始吧
Let's do this.

46
00:03:22,024 --> 00:03:24,444
今晚怎么了
Hey, what happened tonight?

47
00:03:24,527 --> 00:03:27,947
你脑子短路了吗
Are you out of your fucking mind?

48
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,365
好了
Okay.

49
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:31,909
我真的不知道你在说什么
I genuinely have no idea  what you're talking about,

50
00:03:31,993 --> 00:03:35,121
但你也许应该注意下你的态度
but you might want to check that attitude of yours

51
00:03:35,204 --> 00:03:37,999
在那扇惊人的门前
at that very impressive door.

52
00:03:41,043 --> 00:03:43,212
欢迎光临
Hello and welcome.

53
00:03:43,296 --> 00:03:44,630
请原谅我
Please accept my apologies.

54
00:03:44,714 --> 00:03:47,216
我不知道屋里来了客人
I was unaware there were guests in the house.

55
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,551
我会执行一次全面诊断
I will run a full diagnostic

56
00:03:48,634 --> 00:03:50,074
来判断出错的原因
to determine the cause of this error

57
00:03:50,136 --> 00:03:52,638
确保不会再次发生
to ensure it does not happen again.

58
00:03:52,722 --> 00:03:54,223
别冲动
stand down.

59
00:03:54,307 --> 00:03:56,076
卡梅隆一定装了智能房屋之类的东西
Cameron must have, like, a smart house or something.

60
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,269
- 这不是真的人  - 这他妈是什么
- It's not a real person.  - What the fuck is it, then?

61
00:03:58,352 --> 00:03:59,645
这就是个声音
It's... it's just a voice,

62
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:02,315
就像是没有身躯的机器人
it's like a robot without a body.

63
00:04:02,398 --> 00:04:03,399
你是谁
Who are you?

64
00:04:03,483 --> 00:04:05,651

00:04:43,314 --> 00:04:45,358
不对  是詹姆叔叔在家吗
Uncle Jim returning home?

78
00:04:45,441 --> 00:04:47,610
优秀电影制作人詹姆斯·卡梅隆正在

84
00:04:59,455 --> 00:05:03,084
社交日程有很大的影响力

85
00:05:04,585 --> 00:05:07,713
我们能不能在詹姆叔叔回家前
Hey, is there any chance that we could get a tour

86
00:05:07,797 --> 00:05:09,715
去他的实验室逛逛
of Uncle Jim's lab before he gets home?

87
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:13,219
抱歉  但贾克斯·阿诺德和儿童看护专家们

90
00:05:19,058 --> 00:05:21,894
西格尼
Hey, SIGORNE.

91
00:05:21,978 --> 00:05:23,354
你有没有想要
You think you might want to

92
00:05:23,437 --> 00:05:24,623
休息一小会
take a break for a little while?

93
00:05:24,647 --> 00:05:26,232
关机一下下
You know, turn yourself off?

94
00:05:26,315 --> 00:05:29,360
我永远不会关机
There is no off.

95
00:05:29,443 --> 00:05:31,612

Come here.

97
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,951
我觉得西格尼是个麻烦
I think SIGORNE's going to be a bit of a problem.

98
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,914
我们得关闭她
We need to shut her down.

99
00:05:41,998 --> 00:05:44,375
沃夫  找到给她供电的主机

100
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:45,501
毁掉它

101
00:05:45,585 --> 00:05:47,086
我和西格尼无冤无仇的
Well, I got no beef with SIGORNE.

102
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:48,838
她听上去很有修养

而且又亲切  又有母性

我在这屋子里很有安全感
I feel safe in this house.

105
00:05:54,844 --> 00:05:56,512
我不关心你的感觉
Okay, your feelings mean nothing to me.

106
00:05:56,596 --> 00:05:57,930
你是爆破专家
You're the demolitions expert.

107
00:05:58,014 --> 00:06:01,058
找到她的机械脑  然后炸飞它
Find her robot brain and blow it up.

108
00:06:04,186 --> 00:06:06,522
如果我是房子
If I was a house,

109
00:06:06,606 --> 00:06:09,108
我会把大脑放在哪
where would my brain be?

110
00:06:30,296 --> 00:06:32,173

对高于一般人的詹姆斯·卡梅隆来说

等等
So... wait.

121

他一辈子都在专注一件事
He trained all his life to do one thing,

122
00:07:05,498 --> 00:07:06,666
并且很拿手
was great at it,

123
00:07:06,749 --> 00:07:10,252
然后又找到其他拿手的事
then found other stuff he was great at and he...

124
00:07:10,336 --> 00:07:11,671
然后全做成了
