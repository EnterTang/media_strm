哈哈 不是PPL

66
00:02:08,548 --> 00:02:09,709
This isn't product placement.

I want to go to the place where we shot the first episode.
想去的地方是第一次拍攝的地方

90
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:41,508
It's the SBS building.

91
00:02:40,172 --> 00:02:46,592
在SBS 其實 那個時候不是露天的嗎

92
00:02:42,618 --> 00:02:42,679
(11 years earlier from today in 2010,)

93
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:45,286
We don't usually get to go there.

其實現在是想去也去不了的地方

100
00:02:50,157 --> 00:02:51,019
Actually, it's not like...

101
00:02:52,119 --> 00:02:54,318
I can go there whenever I want now.

102
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:57,658
And we went to the Han River many times.
還有漢江也去過好多次

103
00:02:58,299 --> 00:02:59,829
We crossed the river in winter.
冬天還橫穿了漢江

104
00:03:00,258 --> 00:03:01,399
And...
在漢江拍攝過很多次

105
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:02,507
We shot a lot of episodes at the Han River.

106
00:03:02,507 --> 00:03:04,627
We shot a lot of episodes at the Han River.

(And they swam across the river.)

114
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:10,968
- It's really cold. - What kind of punishment is this?
(And they swam across the river.)
怎麼還有這種事啊

115
00:03:10,968 --> 00:03:11,579
(And they swam across the river.)
-我們選擇李光洙-像這樣在漢江不管做什麼

116
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:11,778
I want to go to the Han River...

119
00:03:12,908 --> 00:03:15,448
(They also greeted the two new members at the Han River.)

120
00:03:15,448 --> 00:03:16,679
whatever we do there.

Things I want to eat?

125
00:03:25,258 --> 00:03:26,489
There was a day...

126
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:30,627
when we shot an episode at my place.
有過在我們家拍攝的時候

127
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:32,698
I had chicken soup...
那個時候吃了一整隻雞

128
00:03:32,758 --> 00:03:33,868
with the members.

129
00:03:33,868 --> 00:03:34,257

Okay.

134
00:03:37,429 --> 00:03:37,468
(They went to Kwang Soo's place and ate chicken kalguksu there.)

135
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:39,798
It tastes even better at Kwang Soo's place.
(They went to Kwang Soo's place and ate chicken kalguksu there.)

136
00:03:38,592 --> 00:03:40,252
得在光洙家裡吃 真的很好吃

137
00:03:39,798 --> 00:03:39,799
(They went to Kwang Soo's place and ate chicken kalguksu there.)

138
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:41,037
The chicken breast is for Jong Kook.

(They shared the hot soup giggling together on a winter day.)

143
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:46,278
I think that's my happy memory about food.
(They shared the hot soup giggling together on a winter day.)
在我個人看來那好像是我回憶中的美食

00:03:50,508 --> 00:03:53,648
And we recently went to a pork belly restaurant.
還有不久前不是去了五花肉店嗎

146
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:55,149
That day,
那時候他們吃的那麼香的樣子

147
00:03:55,218 --> 00:03:55,828
I saw the members enjoy the food a lot.

148
00:03:55,828 --> 00:03:58,818
I saw the members enjoy the food a lot.
(The members shared pork belly two months ago.)

149
00:03:58,818 --> 00:03:58,889
(The members shared pork belly two months ago.)
真的好像很久都沒有見過了

150
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:01,218
We've been to many good restaurants, but that day...
(The members shared pork belly two months ago.)
我們去過很多美食店

151
00:04:01,218 --> 00:04:02,028
(The members shared pork belly two months ago.)

152
00:04:02,089 --> 00:04:02,167
I really enjoyed it too.
而且我也覺得很好吃

153
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:05,258
I really enjoyed it too.
(He felt happy to see the members enjoy the food.)

154
00:04:05,258 --> 00:04:06,459
(He felt happy to see the members enjoy the food.)
如果可以的話 也想吃五花肉

155
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:07,137
If it's possible,
(He felt happy to see the members enjoy the food.)

156
00:04:07,137 --> 00:04:07,398
If it's possible,

157
00:04:07,398 --> 00:04:07,728
If it's possible,
(He has warm memories about chicken kalguksu and pork belly.)

158
00:04:07,728 --> 00:04:08,829
(He has warm memories about chicken kalguksu and pork belly.)

159
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:10,598
I want to eat pork belly too.
(He has warm memories about chicken kalguksu and pork belly.)

160
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:11,769
(He has warm memories about chicken kalguksu and pork belly.)

161
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:12,037
In the same episode,
(He has warm memories about chicken kalguksu and pork belly.)
還有回去的時候不是去了LP吧嗎

162
00:04:12,037 --> 00:04:13,068
In the same episode,

163
00:04:13,369 --> 00:04:15,339
we also went to the LP bar.

164
00:04:15,242 --> 00:04:21,102
再去一次LP吧的話 應該會很開心吧

165
00:04:16,309 --> 00:04:18,139
If we go there one more time,

166
00:04:19,508 --> 00:04:20,709
they will like it.

167
00:04:21,787 --> 00:04:23,978
(Kwang Soo only chooses the foods and places that the members like.)

168
00:04:23,978 --> 00:04:25,279
Personally, I just want...
(Kwang Soo only chooses the foods and places that the members like.)
按我個人來說的話希望和平常一樣

169
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,817
(Kwang Soo only chooses the foods and places that the members like.)

170
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:29,188
things to be normal as always.

171
00:04:28,752 --> 00:04:35,172
平常 平常拍攝的時候那樣

172
00:04:29,788 --> 00:04:32,359
Just like an ordinary day.

173
00:04:33,097 --> 00:04:33,218
(He hopes his last day to be as fun as usual.)

174
00:04:33,218 --> 00:04:37,529
Honestly, that's how...
(He hopes his last day to be as fun as usual.)

175
00:04:35,312 --> 00:04:38,972
真的是我真情實意的想法

176
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:38,158
(He hopes his last day to be as fun as usual.)

177
00:04:38,158 --> 00:04:39,329
I'm feeling now.
(He hopes his last day to be as fun as usual.)

178
00:04:39,329 --> 00:04:40,138
(He hopes his last day to be as fun as usual.)

179
00:04:41,668 --> 00:04:41,807
What? Since this is Kwang Soo's last day,
什麼 因為今天是光洙最後一天

180
00:04:41,807 --> 00:04:43,867

181
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:43,868
(So today's race is prepared according to Kwang Soo's wish.)
所以在首播時的地方

(So today's race is prepared according to Kwang Soo's wish.)

183
00:04:45,038 --> 00:04:47,168
(So today's race is prepared according to Kwang Soo's wish.)

184
00:04:47,168 --> 00:04:47,607
- Am I right? - It looks just the same.
(So today's race is prepared according to Kwang Soo's wish.)

Oh, those punks. Right. Thank you.

1980
00:30:52,628 --> 00:30:54,268
- Their eyes look scary. - Look at that.
眼神很凶

1981
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,739
It has the R logo on the side.
-哥 他腋下有R標誌耶 -鳥身上…

1982
00:30:56,739 --> 00:30:57,208

1993
00:31:02,148 --> 00:31:02,908
I think the mission is to catch the seagull.

海鷗的腋下怎麼會有R標誌

2004
00:31:09,848 --> 00:31:10,226
- That doesn't make sense. - You might get 1,000 years...

這樣就能結束了 有R標誌啊

2017
00:31:16,327 --> 00:31:16,418
You can finish it right away. It has the logo on its body.

2018
00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:16,527
- Hurry up and go. - No way.

We're passing the bridge.
(While the seagulls delivered the mission, )

2022
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:19,227

(the cruise is passing the halfway point.)

2027
00:31:22,128 --> 00:31:22,767
There might be the monster from "The Host" hanging there.
(the cruise is passing the halfway point.)
或許會有怪物貼在上面

2028
00:31:22,767 --> 00:31:23,429
There might be the monster from "The Host" hanging there.

2036
00:31:31,608 --> 00:31:33,107
- How many are there left? - It feels...

2037
00:31:33,107 --> 00:31:33,108
(Sad)
能繼續做下去就好了

2038

It feels like we're counting down the hours before saying goodbye.
(Sad)

2041
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,578
It feels like we're counting down the hours before saying goodbye.
感覺在倒數我們分開

2042
00:31:37,247 --> 00:31:38,709
(The mission will be revealed while everyone's sad.)

-你居然笑 -什麼情況

2092
00:32:24,529 --> 00:32:25,368

It's so annoying!
(Smirking)

2098
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:28,327
It's so annoying!
-我第一次見海鷗發出那樣的聲音-喂嘲笑人嗎

2099
00:32:28,328 --> 00:32:30,398
I've never heard seagulls make that sound before.

2100
00:32:30,499 --> 00:32:30,608
It was laughing at you like crazy.

It was laughing at you like crazy.
它笑了 貼著的它 站著的那隻

2103
00:32:32,568 --> 00:32:34,698
That one standing over there.

2104
00:32:34,699 --> 00:32:36,297
Why are the seagulls gathering over here?
-是啊 -為什麼這麼多海鷗啊

2105
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:37,948
Isn't that the one with the R mark?
剛咯吱窩裡有R標誌的不是它嗎

2106
00:32:37,948 --> 00:32:38,107
Isn't that the one with the R mark?
(It was this one.)
-太過分了 -真是的

2107

(They all complain of seasickness.)
胃不舒服啊

2508
00:38:22,148 --> 00:38:23,349
I don't feel that good either.
(They all complain of seasickness.)

2509
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:23,457
(They all complain of seasickness.)
啊額 因為光洙不幹了

2510
00:38:23,478 --> 00:38:26,119
Just because Kwang Soo's dropping out...
-莫名就 -哎 真是的

2511
00:38:26,789 --> 00:38:27,817
If it weren't for him,
要不是光洙的話

2512
00:38:27,818 --> 00:38:29,658
- we'd be doing something else. - Exactly.
我們應該就做其他的了啊

(The quitting donkey causes problems everywhere.)

2514
00:38:29,789 --> 00:38:30,318
(The quitting donkey causes problems everywhere.)
為什麼要說不幹了啊

2515
00:38:30,318 --> 00:38:32,598
- You just had to quit the show. - Tell me about it.
(The quitting donkey causes problems everywhere.)
就是說啊

2516
00:38:32,598 --> 00:38:32,888
- You just had to quit the show. - Tell me about it.
就再推翻吧 說再做一會兒

2517
00:38:32,889 --> 00:38:35,298
Take it back and say you'll stick around a little longer.

2518
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:37,268
Say this near the end of the show.
光洙呀 差不多結束的時候就說吧

2519
00:38:37,699 --> 00:38:37,707
"I'll choose one..."
代替我

"I'll choose one..."
(Peeking)

2521
00:38:38,728 --> 00:38:38,898
(Peeking)
將指名一人

2522
00:38:38,898 --> 00:38:40,369
"to drop out instead of me."
(Peeking)

2523

00:38:42,308 --> 00:38:42,767
That'd be fun.

Runningman

2526
00:38:42,767 --> 00:38:42,768
(They get a hint of who Kwang Soo will pick.)

2527
00:38:42,768 --> 00:38:44,437

Wouldn't it be fun?
(They get a hint of who Kwang Soo will pick.)

2530
00:38:45,147 --> 00:38:45,509

"Jee Seok Jin out."
池石鎮OUT

2532
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:52,378

儘管遺憾
無關我的意願 而要下車了

2533
00:38:53,487 --> 00:38:53,548

A refreshment period?

2538
00:38:56,518 --> 00:38:57,248
A refreshment period?

這次任務是模仿光洙模仿得越像

2547
00:39:02,797 --> 00:39:02,889
In this next round,

2548

(To win the round, they must fool the receiver.)
被電話騙了過去

2572
00:39:21,718 --> 00:39:23,138
He does, all the time.
哎 真是的

2573
00:39:23,139 --> 00:39:23,687
Why does he keep calling me after drinking?
他怎麼總是喝完酒給我打電話

2574
00:39:23,687 --> 00:39:25,708
Why does he keep calling me after drinking?

(They'll lose the round if the receiver figures it out.)

2578
00:39:29,048 --> 00:39:29,288
This won't be easy at all.

2579
00:39:29,288 --> 00:39:31,219
This won't be easy at all.
(5 years of his sentence will be reduced every second...)
有點難啊 有點難

2580
00:39:31,219 --> 00:39:31,648
(5 years of his sentence will be reduced every second...)

2581
00:39:31,648 --> 00:39:31,657
Can you say "Hello"?
(5 years of his sentence will be reduced every second...)
哥 來說一下吧 你好

00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:46,298
Seok Jin, are you willing to play?
哥要挑戰嗎

2600
00:39:46,568 --> 00:39:47,698
I should.
試一試吧

2601
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:48,078
No, there's no need for that.

2602
00:39:48,078 --> 00:39:49,468
No, there's no need for that.
(He's too confident for his poor impression of Kwang Soo.)
-哥 不行 -竭盡全力

2603
00:39:49,468 --> 00:39:49,469
(He's too confident for his poor impression of Kwang Soo.)

2604
00:39:49,469 --> 00:39:51,138
- I should give it a try. - Pick someone...
(He's too confident for his poor impression of Kwang Soo.)
還有另一方最好不在家

2605
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:51,139
(He's too confident for his poor impression of Kwang Soo.)

2606
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:51,448
who isn't home.
(He's too confident for his poor impression of Kwang Soo.)

2607

who isn't home.

2608
00:39:52,478 --> 00:39:52,667
who isn't home.
(It's advantageous if Kwang Soo's acquaintance is outside.)

2609
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:52,668
(It's advantageous if Kwang Soo's acquaintance is outside.)

2613
00:39:55,578 --> 00:39:55,877
Someone who's out and about.
-聽不清 -有室外噪音就聽不清了

2614
00:39:55,878 --> 00:39:57,178
To mask the sound?

2615
00:39:57,179 --> 00:39:59,448
It'll seem less obvious if other sounds get mixed in.

2616
00:39:59,449 --> 00:40:00,779
Wait. How about...
-對 -哥 要不
-剛剛從沒跟安普賢打過電話 -普賢

2617

2620
00:40:05,648 --> 00:40:07,087
That's perfect.

2621
00:40:07,088 --> 00:40:07,397
He won't know my voice since we haven't talked before.
因為第一次打電話

2622
00:40:07,397 --> 00:40:09,357
He won't know my voice since we haven't talked before.
(He might not recognize Kwang Soo's voice.)
-不知道聲音如何 -打電話 這樣挺好

2623

(He might not recognize Kwang Soo's voice.)

2624

If you call him... Yes, he might not realize it.

2626
00:40:11,489 --> 00:40:11,928
What did the text say?
說什麼了 內容是什麼

2627
00:40:11,928 --> 00:40:12,828
What did the text say?
(They have a shot with him.)

2628
00:40:12,828 --> 00:40:12,829
(They have a shot with him.)
-需要提前知道 -就是說辛苦了

2629
00:40:12,829 --> 00:40:15,159
- He said I did a good job. - We should know.
(They have a shot with him.)

2630
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:15,337
(They have a shot with him.)
普賢 普賢

2631
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:16,627
- Perfect. - He told me...

2632
00:40:16,628 --> 00:40:17,869

(He calls Bo Hyun right away.)

2635
00:40:20,298 --> 00:40:20,329
(He calls Bo Hyun right away.)
石鎮哥感覺也可以模仿一下

2636
00:40:20,329 --> 00:40:21,938
Even Seok Jin could make it work.

That was Seok Jin on the phone just now.

2709
00:41:41,279 --> 00:41:43,678
How could he not know? It sounded completely different.
怎麼能沒發現 完全不一樣啊

2710
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:43,987
- Gosh, well... - It sounded completely different.

00:41:50,289 --> 00:41:51,289
What?

2719
00:41:52,029 --> 00:41:53,528
I knew it didn't sound like him.
明明不是哥的聲音

2720
00:41:53,529 --> 00:41:55,857
I thought he sounded different, so I thought he cried.
感覺不像 以為哭了

2721
00:41:55,858 --> 00:41:56,957
No.

2722
00:41:56,958 --> 00:41:57,607
Even if he cried,
就算哭了聲音也過於不同

2723
00:41:57,607 --> 00:41:57,968
Even if he cried,
(Even if he cried, the voice was completely different.)

(Even if he cried, the voice was completely different.)

2728
00:42:00,837 --> 00:42:01,067
I know. That's why...

2729
00:42:01,068 --> 00:42:02,267
I was going to ask,

2730
00:42:02,268 --> 00:42:03,937
- Right. - but I thought he sounded upset.

怕心情不好 沒能問

2732
00:42:04,547 --> 00:42:06,568
You thought he sounded sad, so you couldn't ask?

2741
00:42:12,309 --> 00:42:15,449
I started to feel guilty while I was doing it.

2742
00:42:14,392 --> 00:42:15,092
可以這樣嗎

2743

(He knew that the members would hate even a small gift.)
甚至很不喜歡收生日禮物

4232
01:15:37,794 --> 01:15:38,223
They don't even like receiving birthday presents.

4233
01:15:38,223 --> 01:15:38,439
They don't even like receiving birthday presents.
(Kwang Soo was looking for a natural way to give them.)

4234
01:15:38,439 --> 01:15:39,138
(Kwang Soo was looking for a natural way to give them.)

4235
01:15:39,138 --> 01:15:41,108
They get embarrassed.
(Kwang Soo was looking for a natural way to give them.)
很不好意思所以

4236
01:15:41,108 --> 01:15:41,109
(Kwang Soo was looking for a natural way to give them.)
但其實雖然是為了成員們沒錯

4237
01:15:41,109 --> 01:15:41,494
The presents are for the members...
(Kwang Soo was looking for a natural way to give them.)

4238
01:15:41,494 --> 01:15:45,507
The presents are for the members...

4239
01:15:45,508 --> 01:15:49,149
as well as myself.
不管怎樣也算是為了我自己

4240
01:15:47,262 --> 01:15:48,472
稍微準備了點禮物

4241
01:15:49,649 --> 01:15:50,303
- My heart will be lighter. - If you give the presents?
唯有這樣才能讓我心裡好受些

4242
01:15:50,303 --> 01:15:52,618
- My heart will be lighter. - If you give the presents?
(On behalf of Kwang Soo who felt sorry for the members...)

4243
01:15:51,452 --> 01:15:52,551
-付出一些 -嗯嗯

4244
01:15:52,618 --> 01:15:52,619
(On behalf of Kwang Soo who felt sorry for the members...)
付出一些

4245
01:15:52,619 --> 01:15:53,819
That's right.
(On behalf of Kwang Soo who felt sorry for the members...)

4246
01:15:53,819 --> 01:15:54,943
(On behalf of Kwang Soo who felt sorry for the members...)

4247
01:15:55,004 --> 01:15:55,319
(On the day of the shooting, )

4248
01:15:55,319 --> 01:15:57,112
- You prepared presents. - Yes.
(On the day of the shooting, )
聽說你準備了禮物

4249
01:15:57,112 --> 01:15:57,113
- You prepared presents. - Yes.

4250
01:15:57,113 --> 01:15:58,858
- You prepared presents. - Yes.
(the staff notified him of a surprise hidden rule.)
對的

4251
01:15:58,858 --> 01:15:58,859
(the staff notified him of a surprise hidden rule.)
我們瞞著李光洙

4252
01:15:58,859 --> 01:15:59,773
We received the presents from your manager.
(the staff notified him of a surprise hidden rule.)

4253
01:15:59,773 --> 01:15:59,943
We received the presents from your manager.

4254
01:15:59,943 --> 01:16:02,488
We received the presents from your manager.
(The race where the staff will take credit...)
通過經紀人收到了那些禮物

4255
01:16:02,488 --> 01:16:02,489
(The race where the staff will take credit...)
準備了用這些禮物來進行的競賽

4256
01:16:02,489 --> 01:16:02,543
We plan to use them for the race today.
(The race where the staff will take credit...)

4257
01:16:02,543 --> 01:16:02,544
We plan to use them for the race today.

4258
01:16:02,544 --> 01:16:04,899
We plan to use them for the race today.
(for Kwang Soo's gifts is now ready to go.)

4259
01:16:04,899 --> 01:16:04,954
(for Kwang Soo's gifts is now ready to go.)

4260
01:16:04,958 --> 01:16:05,613
The members think those presents are for you,
成員們都以為是李光洙的禮物時間

4261
01:16:05,613 --> 01:16:07,769
The members think those presents are for you,
(Kwang Soo's last race...)

4262
01:16:07,769 --> 01:16:07,869
(Kwang Soo's last race...)

4263
01:16:07,869 --> 01:16:08,352
but it's actually your chance...
(Kwang Soo's last race...)
其實李光洙要選擇

4264
01:16:08,352 --> 01:16:08,353
but it's actually your chance...

4265
01:16:08,353 --> 01:16:10,368
but it's actually your chance...
(will be over the gifts that Kwang Soo prepared.)

4266
01:16:10,368 --> 01:16:10,369
(will be over the gifts that Kwang Soo prepared.)
是否能將準備好的那些禮物

4267
01:16:10,369 --> 01:16:13,498
to deliver them to the members.
(will be over the gifts that Kwang Soo prepared.)

4268
01:16:11,382 --> 01:16:13,422
送到成員們的手上

4269
01:16:13,498 --> 01:16:13,769
(will be over the gifts that Kwang Soo prepared.)

4270
01:16:13,769 --> 01:16:14,063
You must pick a boiled egg to give each member a present.
(will be over the gifts that Kwang Soo prepared.)
要選中煮熟的雞蛋才能給該成員送上禮物

4271
01:16:14,063 --> 01:16:17,877
You must pick a boiled egg to give each member a present.

4272
01:16:17,878 --> 01:16:18,134
- I think he will succeed. - My goodness.
感覺這次會成功

4273
01:16:18,134 --> 01:16:20,649
- I think he will succeed. - My goodness.
(Kwang Soo picked the eggs carefully for the members.)

4274
01:16:19,152 --> 01:16:20,372
哎喲喂

4275
01:16:20,649 --> 01:16:22,348
(Kwang Soo picked the eggs carefully for the members.)

4276
01:16:22,348 --> 01:16:23,103
Until the end...
(Kwang Soo picked the eggs carefully for the members.)
在最後

4277
01:16:23,103 --> 01:16:23,348
Until the end...

4278
01:16:23,779 --> 01:16:23,903
It will be hard to pick a boiled egg seven times in a row,
其實很難連續7次選中熟雞蛋

4279
01:16:23,903 --> 01:16:26,503
It will be hard to pick a boiled egg seven times in a row,
(It's very unlikely that Kwang Soo will choose...)

4280
01:16:26,503 --> 01:16:26,504
It will be hard to pick a boiled egg seven times in a row,

4281
01:16:26,504 --> 01:16:26,948
It will be hard to pick a boiled egg seven times in a row,
(boiled eggs 7 times in a row.)

4282
01:16:26,948 --> 01:16:26,949
(boiled eggs 7 times in a row.)
所以也給予李光洙特別的隱藏規則

4283
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:28,103
so you will have a special hidden rule.
(boiled eggs 7 times in a row.)

4284
01:16:28,103 --> 01:16:28,204
so you will have a special hidden rule.

4285
01:16:28,204 --> 01:16:30,118
so you will have a special hidden rule.
(That's why Kwang Soo will be given a hidden rule.)

4286
01:16:30,118 --> 01:16:30,119
(That's why Kwang Soo will be given a hidden rule.)
與李光洙拍最多張照片的人

4287
01:16:30,119 --> 01:16:30,813
The members think that the person who has...
(That's why Kwang Soo will be given a hidden rule.)

4288
01:16:30,813 --> 01:16:30,914
The members think that the person who has...

4289
01:16:30,914 --> 01:16:31,818
The members think that the person who has...
(Members' hidden mission is that whoever gets...)

4290
01:16:31,818 --> 01:16:31,819
(Members' hidden mission is that whoever gets...)

4291
01:16:31,819 --> 01:16:32,772
the most number of photos with you...
(Members' hidden mission is that whoever gets...)

4292
01:16:32,772 --> 01:16:32,773
the most number of photos with you...

4293
01:16:32,773 --> 01:16:33,588
the most number of photos with you...
(the highest number of photos taken with Kwang Soo...)

4294
01:16:33,588 --> 01:16:33,619
(the highest number of photos taken with Kwang Soo...)
就能獲得同樣的禮物

4295
01:16:33,619 --> 01:16:34,812
receives the same presents,
(the highest number of photos taken with Kwang Soo...)

4296
01:16:34,812 --> 01:16:34,813
receives the same presents,

4297
01:16:34,813 --> 01:16:35,088
receives the same presents,
(will win and acquire gifts.)

4298
01:16:35,088 --> 01:16:35,458
(will win and acquire gifts.)

4299
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:38,958
while the person in last place gets a penalty.
(will win and acquire gifts.)
最後一名要接受懲罰

4300
01:16:37,542 --> 01:16:38,922
是這樣告訴他們隱藏規則的

4301
01:16:38,958 --> 01:16:39,058
(will win and acquire gifts.)
所以李光洙如果讓他們成為

4302
01:16:39,058 --> 01:16:40,383
If you help all of them tie for first place,
(will win and acquire gifts.)

4303
01:16:40,383 --> 01:16:40,384
If you help all of them tie for first place,

4304
01:16:40,384 --> 01:16:43,022
If you help all of them tie for first place,
(Kwang Soo's mission...)
隱藏任務的共同第1名

4305
01:16:43,022 --> 01:16:43,023
If you help all of them tie for first place,

4306
01:16:43,023 --> 01:16:43,269
If you help all of them tie for first place,
(is to make them all win.)

4307
01:16:43,269 --> 01:16:43,369
(is to make them all win.)
全員都能獲得第1名

4308
01:16:43,369 --> 01:16:46,598
they will receive the presents...
(is to make them all win.)

4309
01:16:44,802 --> 01:16:46,362
就可以成功獲得獎品

4310
01:16:46,598 --> 01:16:46,699
(is to make them all win.)
所有人都可以免除受罰

4311
01:16:46,699 --> 01:16:47,823
and be exempt from the penalty.
(is to make them all win.)

4312
01:16:47,823 --> 01:16:47,824
and be exempt from the penalty.

4313
01:16:47,824 --> 01:16:50,008
and be exempt from the penalty.
(It's the only way for him to give his gifts...)

4314
01:16:50,008 --> 01:16:50,609
(It's the only way for him to give his gifts...)

4315
01:16:50,609 --> 01:16:50,963
So they need to be in the same number of photos.
(It's the only way for him to give his gifts...)
要讓拍照的照片張數保持一致

4316
01:16:50,963 --> 01:16:50,964
So they need to be in the same number of photos.

4317
01:16:50,964 --> 01:16:52,464
So they need to be in the same number of photos.
(and avoid the penalty.)

4318
01:16:52,464 --> 01:16:52,534
So they need to be in the same number of photos.

4319
01:16:52,534 --> 01:16:54,578
So they need to be in the same number of photos.
(He must make sure that the number of photos...)

4320
01:16:54,578 --> 01:16:54,579
(He must make sure that the number of photos...)

4321
01:16:54,579 --> 01:16:55,402
That's right.
(He must make sure that the number of photos...)
對的

4322
01:16:55,402 --> 01:16:55,403
That's right.

4323
01:16:55,403 --> 01:16:55,649
That's right.
(are the same for all members.)

4324
01:16:55,649 --> 01:16:56,909
(are the same for all members.)

4325
01:16:56,909 --> 01:16:57,233
The real-time rankings will be shown to you secretly...
(are the same for all members.)
所以成員們的實時張數

4326
01:16:57,233 --> 01:16:59,504
The real-time rankings will be shown to you secretly...

4327
01:16:59,504 --> 01:17:00,417
The real-time rankings will be shown to you secretly...
(The staff will show the ranking in secret just for Kwang Soo.)
我們會通過骰子悄悄告訴你

4328
01:17:00,417 --> 01:17:00,418
(The staff will show the ranking in secret just for Kwang Soo.)

4329
01:17:00,418 --> 01:17:02,773
through the dice in front of the production crew.
(The staff will show the ranking in secret just for Kwang Soo.)

4330
01:17:02,773 --> 01:17:03,118
through the dice in front of the production crew.

4331
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:03,443
It will be in the order of age starting from the left.
每個骰子從左開始按照成員們的年齡來排列

4332
01:17:03,443 --> 01:17:06,557
It will be in the order of age starting from the left.
(The dice order will be in the members' age.)

4333
01:17:06,557 --> 01:17:06,558
(The dice order will be in the members' age.)
每個骰子的數字

4334
01:17:06,558 --> 01:17:06,573
Each die's number shows the member's ranking.
(The dice order will be in the members' age.)

4335
01:17:06,573 --> 01:17:06,574

4336
01:17:06,574 --> 01:17:11,053
Each die's number shows the member's ranking.
(Each die's number shows the member's ranking.)

4337
01:17:07,822 --> 01:17:10,942
就代表該成員隱藏任務的目前排名

4338
01:17:11,053 --> 01:17:11,153
Each die's number shows the member's ranking.

4339
01:17:11,153 --> 01:17:11,158
Each die's number shows the member's ranking.
(He must make sure that all dice have 1...)
進入LP BAR 開始秘密任務就結束了

4340
01:17:11,158 --> 01:17:11,159
(He must make sure that all dice have 1...)

4341
01:17:11,159 --> 01:17:13,583
The moment you enter the last venue, the LP bar,
(He must make sure that all dice have 1...)

4342
01:17:13,583 --> 01:17:13,584
The moment you enter the last venue, the LP bar,

4343
01:17:13,584 --> 01:17:13,927
The moment you enter the last venue, the LP bar,
(before he enters the LP bar.)

4344
01:17:13,927 --> 01:17:13,928
(before he enters the LP bar.)

4345
01:17:13,928 --> 01:17:15,254
the hidden mission will end.
(before he enters the LP bar.)

4346
01:17:15,254 --> 01:17:15,428
the hidden mission will end.

4347
01:17:16,069 --> 01:17:17,298
What?
怎麼了 怎麼了

4348
01:17:17,624 --> 01:17:22,193
(Thus started Kwang Soo's game of wits.)
怎麼了啊
為什麼總是要說孩子

4349
01:17:22,769 --> 01:17:22,994
Let me see the rankings.

4350
01:17:22,994 --> 01:17:23,979
Let me see the rankings.
(He checked with the producer from time to time.)

4351
01:17:23,979 --> 01:17:25,508
(He checked with the producer from time to time.)

4352
01:17:25,508 --> 01:17:26,808
Is Se Chan in last place?
(He checked with the producer from time to time.)
世燦是最後一名嗎

4353
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:27,433
(He checked with the producer from time to time.)

4354
01:17:27,964 --> 01:17:29,079
(Kwang Soo learned that Se Chan is in the bottom place...)

4355
01:17:29,079 --> 01:17:30,478
How many remains?
(Kwang Soo learned that Se Chan is in the bottom place...)
還剩幾個

4356
01:17:30,478 --> 01:17:30,479
(Kwang Soo learned that Se Chan is in the bottom place...)

4357
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:30,933
It's nice.
(Kwang Soo learned that Se Chan is in the bottom place...)

4358
01:17:30,933 --> 01:17:31,473
It's nice.
-越來越覺得 -還要繼續

4359
01:17:31,473 --> 01:17:31,878
It's nice.
(and stayed close to Se Chan.)

4360
01:17:31,878 --> 01:17:34,574
(and stayed close to Se Chan.)

4361
01:17:34,744 --> 01:17:39,244
(He followed Se Chan around.)

4362
01:17:39,458 --> 01:17:40,714
That's a lot.
來了好多啊

4363
01:17:40,714 --> 01:17:41,088
That's a lot.
(When he pulled Se Chan up in the rankings, )

4364
01:17:41,088 --> 01:17:43,483
(When he pulled Se Chan up in the rankings, )

4365
01:17:44,183 --> 01:17:47,483

life doesn't always go as we planned.
人生並不會隨我們的心意而動

4687
01:24:10,918 --> 01:24:13,004
