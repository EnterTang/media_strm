1
00:00:03,852 --> 00:00:05,619
Pardon me, miss?

2
00:00:07,321 --> 00:00:09,422
I'm looking for Mike Baxter.

3
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,725
- Actually, it's "ma'am."
- Ah.

4
00:00:11,793 --> 00:00:13,794
- My mistake.
- Hey.

5
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:15,095
How are you?

6
00:00:15,163 --> 00:00:16,897
You guys all know
my kid brother Jimmy, right?

7
00:00:16,964 --> 00:00:18,298
Hey.

8
00:00:18,365 --> 00:00:20,967
And you all know
my personal masseuse, Ramone?

9
00:00:21,035 --> 00:00:22,634
Hey.

10
00:00:22,703 --> 00:00:24,269
They'll wave at anything,
won't they?

11
00:00:24,337 --> 00:00:26,906
Well, they probably think you're
that special needs visitor

12
00:00:26,973 --> 00:00:29,274
- that's coming by to take a tour of the store.
- Ah.

13
00:00:29,342 --> 00:00:31,110
Yes. Keep talking, brother.

14
00:00:31,178 --> 00:00:33,179
The only special need
you're gonna have to worry about

15
00:00:33,246 --> 00:00:36,015
is learning how to speak
without your teeth.

16
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:39,117
So you still think you could
take your older brother?

17
00:00:39,185 --> 00:00:42,286
With my eyes closed
d d my feet in cement.

18
00:00:42,354 --> 00:00:45,223
Which is pretty much how you
played little league baseball.

19
00:00:46,926 --> 00:00:49,194
"I'm scared. I'm scared."

20
00:00:49,261 --> 00:00:52,496
Okay. That one actually
hurt a little.

21
00:00:52,564 --> 00:00:53,964
So what are you doing
in Denver?

22
00:00:54,032 --> 00:00:56,466
You run out of
social diseases out in Durango?

23
00:00:56,534 --> 00:00:58,936
Ah. You getting
a little senile?

24
00:00:59,003 --> 00:01:01,171
I'm here to talk with Ed
about the bid

25
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:03,673
to build your new store
out by the airport.

26
00:01:03,742 --> 00:01:05,342
Yeah. Yeah.

27
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:07,410
Ed!

28
00:01:09,313 --> 00:01:10,346
Jim!

29
00:01:10,413 --> 00:01:12,414
Hey, Edward.

30
00:01:12,482 --> 00:01:14,717
- Good to see you, Ed. How are you?
- Thank you. Good to see you.

31
00:01:14,785 --> 00:01:18,955
- Great.
- Michael, I'm seriously considering letting Jim build

32
00:01:19,022 --> 00:01:22,225
our next store in Thornton. Huh?
Pending your okay, of course.

33
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:23,525
Yeah, yeah, that's great.

34
00:01:23,593 --> 00:01:24,593
Uh, we gotta talk
in your office for a minute.

35
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:25,761
We'll be right back out.

36
00:01:25,828 --> 00:01:27,229
I'll just spread out here.

37
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,864
Dot t touch any of my stuff.

38
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:32,200
Listen, Ed, why are you always

39
00:01:32,268 --> 00:01:34,970
springing stuff on me
without any warning?

40
00:01:35,037 --> 00:01:37,705
"Always"?
Name one other time.

41
00:01:37,774 --> 00:01:39,074
Off the top of my head,

42
00:01:39,142 --> 00:01:42,009
how about the "exotic elf"
at the Christmas party?

43
00:01:42,077 --> 00:01:46,247
I had no idea she was gonna
take her clothes off.

44
00:01:47,448 --> 00:01:50,985
The kids were in shock.

45
00:01:51,052 --> 00:01:54,021
If it's any consolation,
later on in the evening,

46
00:01:54,089 --> 00:01:57,224
she stole my TV set.

47
00:01:57,292 --> 00:02:01,427
When we talked about my brother
coming here to bid on this,

48
00:02:01,495 --> 00:02:04,164
I said I don't mix
business and family.

49
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:06,632
Come on. Your brother's been
doing construction for 25 years.

50
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,934
Yeah, but if we give him
this job,

51
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,402
he's gonna be around here
for a year.

52
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:10,636
So?

53
00:02:10,704 --> 00:02:12,505
I can't even be
on a touch football team

54
00:02:12,572 --> 00:02:14,940
with a guy like that.
He'll have to play quarterback.

55
00:02:15,008 --> 00:02:17,309
I'm a receiver.
He sends me on the wrong route!

56
00:02:17,376 --> 00:02:18,977
I'm in the end zone,
going like this--

57
00:02:19,045 --> 00:02:21,413
"I'm open! I'm open! I'm open!
For the love--"

58
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,016
yeah! And that's just what
he did, like this.

59
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,751
This-- this sounds--
sounds like a classic case

60
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,553
of two alpha males
fighting for turf,

61
00:02:28,621 --> 00:02:33,791
like-- like-- like monkeys
or-- or aggressive tree roots.

62
00:02:35,227 --> 00:02:37,594
Don't get me wrong.
I love my idiot brother.

63
00:02:37,662 --> 00:02:42,633
Yeah. In my experience, fighting
and loving go hand in hand.

64
00:02:42,701 --> 00:02:45,002
That's why
your second wife shot you.

65
00:02:46,437 --> 00:02:48,939
Then we made love
in the ambulance.

66
00:02:51,142 --> 00:02:53,376
You decide about working with
Jim, but I'll tell you this--

67
00:02:53,444 --> 00:02:56,412
it was a hell of a bid,
and they have some great ideas.

68
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,048
"They"?

69
00:02:58,115 --> 00:03:00,050
Is my dad involved in this?

70
00:03:03,053 --> 00:03:05,054
Michael, don't sucuch.

71
00:03:05,839 --> 00:03:08,389

00:03:15,498 --> 00:03:17,233
Hey, w-what are you doing?

75
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,433
Just deleting
all your "hoarders" episodes.

76
00:03:19,501 --> 00:03:25,139
Well, don't, don't. They make me
feel good about my closet.

77
00:03:26,475 --> 00:03:28,843
Mom, you have
more than 20 saved up.

78
00:03:28,911 --> 00:03:32,080
You know, mother, you're
actually hoarding "hoarders."

79
00:03:34,249 --> 00:03:37,484
Hey, everybody,
we got a visitor alert.

80
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,319
Hey, hey.

81
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:40,420
Jimmy!

82
00:03:40,488 --> 00:03:41,989
- Hi.
- Hey, guys. Oh, my God.

83
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:44,024
- Hey. Mwah. Hi.
- Look at you. Hey, beautiful.

84
00:03:44,092 --> 00:03:46,559
You are still
way too gorgeous for my brother.

85
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:48,628
Oh, stop, stop.

86
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:51,197
Ah, no, one more thing.
Say one more nice thing.

87
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,066
You smell pretty.

88
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:57,103
Aw. Honey, how come you never
say things like that?

89
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,638
Because I already have ya.

90
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:02,541
Yeah. Please, big hug.
Let me look at you.

91
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,311
I'm trying to remember which
one of you I like the best.

92
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:06,311
It's me.

93
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,745
It was you, briefly.

94
00:04:07,813 --> 00:04:11,383
Mike. Where do I plug in
the sewage pipe for my RV?

95
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,084
Where did we do it last time?

96
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:15,453
The Wongs',
and they didn't like it.

97
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:18,856
- Hello, beautiful. Mm.
- Oh, my good-- mwah. Ohh. Good to see you.

98
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,825
Gosh, why didn't you two
tell us you were coming?

99
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,359
We didn't want
to be any trouble.

100
00:04:22,427 --> 00:04:25,195
You'd just be out buying food,
cleaning the guest rooms.

101
00:04:25,263 --> 00:04:27,531
- Yeah.
- Uh, where you going?

102
00:04:27,598 --> 00:04:31,135
I'm gonna go buy food,
clean the guest rooms...

103
00:04:31,202 --> 00:04:35,406
- Remember, I like red meat. It does not like me.
- Yeah.

104
00:04:35,473 --> 00:04:40,209
Trust me, dad, that is something
that, uh, we will never forget.

105
00:04:42,212 --> 00:04:44,547
Why were you trying
to pass me on the freeway?

106
00:04:44,614 --> 00:04:46,115
Why didn't you <i>let</i> me pass you?

107
00:04:46,183 --> 00:04:47,483
Because I'm leading you
to my house.

108
00:04:47,551 --> 00:04:50,553
I know where you live,
<i>and</i> your way is stupid.

109
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,855
My way's stupid? Well, your--
your way is stupider.

110
00:04:52,923 --> 00:04:54,022
I know how to get
to your house.

111
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,424
- It's not a stupid thing--
- ladies.

112
00:04:55,491 --> 00:04:56,658
And ugly.

113
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,795
This is us in 30 years.

114
00:05:00,863 --> 00:05:02,130
Who wants a beer?

115
00:05:02,198 --> 00:05:03,531
Yeah.

116
00:05:04,976 --> 00:05:06,935
What kind do you have?

117
00:05:07,003 --> 00:05:08,971
The free kind.

118
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:10,972
Sounds good.

119
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:14,208
Pop. Take a load off.
I'll go get the bags.

120
00:05:14,276 --> 00:05:16,777
Do it. Don't brag about it.

121
00:05:20,515 --> 00:05:22,816
You girls...

122
00:05:22,884 --> 00:05:25,286
You're so beautiful.

123
00:05:25,354 --> 00:05:27,653
I'm sorry your grandma
couldn't see you all grown up.

124
00:05:27,721 --> 00:05:29,722
Do you still miss her, grandpa?

125
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,824
Sure, I do. She was
my soulmate, you know?

126
00:05:31,892 --> 00:05:34,527
They only come around
once in a lifetime.

127
00:05:34,595 --> 00:05:37,130
Do you still set her place
at the dinner table?

128
00:05:37,198 --> 00:05:40,333
No. That would be creepy.

129
00:05:45,405 --> 00:05:48,374
So, grandpa, what do you do
with all your time?

130
00:05:48,441 --> 00:05:51,143
I fill my days. I, uh,
help Jim run the business.

131
00:05:51,211 --> 00:05:53,778
A little chess in the park.

132
00:05:53,846 --> 00:05:58,582
I write angry letters
to a variety of publications.

133
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,418
Hey, can I get you anything?

134
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:02,120
- Yeah, I'm a little peckish.
- Yeah?

135
00:06:02,187 --> 00:06:04,555
Why don't you grab
those pistachios over there?

136
00:06:04,623 --> 00:06:05,456
Why don't all three of us
get them?

137
00:06:05,524 --> 00:06:06,457
'Cause it's a tiny bowl?

138
00:06:06,525 --> 00:06:07,892
Just come with me.

139
00:06:09,832 --> 00:06:12,630
Guys, grandpa seems
really lonely.

140
00:06:12,697 --> 00:06:14,164
Where did you
get that from?

141
00:06:14,232 --> 00:06:15,932
The way he talks about Nana.
You know, it's been Five years.

142
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,967
- I think n needs to meet someone.
- No, no.

143
00:06:18,036 --> 00:06:19,169
No, no, no. Mandy, we are not
gonna set grandpa up.

144
00:06:19,237 --> 00:06:20,370
Why not?

145
00:06:20,438 --> 00:06:23,573
Because this isn't
a 1950s musical.

146
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:27,210
Hey, what's holding up my nuts?

147
00:06:36,353 --> 00:06:39,621
So Ed's gonna let Baxter & sons
build the new store?

148
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:42,358
It's worse.
He says it's my decision.

149
00:06:42,426 --> 00:06:44,226
So what are you gonna do?

150
00:06:44,294 --> 00:06:45,561
I'm not gonna let him build it.

151
00:06:45,628 --> 00:06:47,762
Jim turns everything
into a competition,

152
00:06:47,829 --> 00:06:50,365
and I'm not gonna let him win.

153
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:54,269
Well, your dad'll be there.
Won't he keep the peace?

154
00:06:54,336 --> 00:06:56,304
Right.
He likes it when we fight.

155
00:06:56,372 --> 00:06:58,940
I think it's
what keeps him alive.

156
00:06:59,007 --> 00:07:00,007
Come on!

157
00:07:00,076 --> 00:07:01,409
I'm not kidding.

158
00:07:01,477 --> 00:07:05,612
Every time Jim and I argue,
my dad's skin looks better.

159
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,415
Well, honey,
maybe this is a good thing.

160
00:07:08,483 --> 00:07:09,883
I mean, I-I think

161
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:12,119
Jimmy's always been a little
jealous of your success.

162
00:07:12,187 --> 00:07:14,054
I mean, maybe this will
bring you closer.

163
00:07:14,122 --> 00:07:15,822
We <i>are</i> close.

164
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,324
Well, you see each other,
what, three times a year?

165
00:07:17,392 --> 00:07:18,824
What do you even talk about?

166
00:07:18,892 --> 00:07:23,196
Everything-- sports, the Broncos,
how the team's doing...

167
00:07:23,263 --> 00:07:26,932
Honey, those are one thing.

168
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,735
Would you go in business
with your sister?

169
00:07:29,803 --> 00:07:30,970
Which one? April or Teri?

170
00:07:31,037 --> 00:07:31,937
Teri.

171
00:07:32,005 --> 00:07:33,172
No.

172
00:07:34,407 --> 00:07:35,407
April?

173
00:07:35,475 --> 00:07:37,008
<i>No.</i>

174
00:07:38,544 --> 00:07:41,580
Why did you say,
"which one?"

175
00:07:41,647 --> 00:07:44,548
You know, my sisters--

176
00:07:44,616 --> 00:07:48,285
they're-- they're varying degrees
of crazy, but Jim-- Jim's not.

177
00:07:48,353 --> 00:07:49,553
Come on.

178
00:07:49,621 --> 00:07:51,555
Can't you just put aside
your family issues

179
00:07:51,623 --> 00:07:53,124
and give the guy a chance?

180
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:57,595
I hate it when you think
I'm a better man than I am.

181
00:08:01,432 --> 00:08:03,699
Hey, Mike. You need a hand
with anything?

182
00:08:03,767 --> 00:08:07,237
Like, um...
Getting me that beer?

183
00:08:07,304 --> 00:08:08,838
How about I get you a job?

184
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,873
Why don't you build
the Outdoor Man?

185
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,578
That's a good call.

186
00:08:15,646 --> 00:08:17,946
"Good call."

187
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:19,781
That's it?

188
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:23,084
What do you want me to do?
Kiss your loafers?

189
00:08:23,153 --> 00:08:24,586
It's a good call.

190
00:08:24,654 --> 00:08:25,987
No, but I-- you know.

191
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:28,223
I'm asking you to build
an 80,000-square-foot building,

192
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:31,326
maybe some guys would say,
"thank you."

193
00:08:31,394 --> 00:08:34,529
- Brother, I'm gonna hand you the best Outdoor Man...
- I-I know you are.

194
00:08:34,596 --> 00:08:36,096
- In the history of Outdoor Men...
- No, I understand all that. I unders--

195
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:39,667
so I'm thinking some guys
would say, "you're welcome."

196
00:08:41,703 --> 00:08:43,704
- <i>Y-you're</i> welcome.
- Right. "You're welcome." It's easy.

197
00:08:43,772 --> 00:08:45,239
- No, <i>you're</i> welcome.
- No, you're totally welcome.

198
00:08:45,307 --> 00:08:47,208
- You start with a "thank you"...
- Listen, this is--

199
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:48,789
my pleasure. You're welcome.

200
00:08:48,909 --> 00:08:49,876
- No, you're welcome.
- You are welcome.

201
00:08:49,943 --> 00:08:53,346
- You're welcome.
- Welcome!

202
00:08:53,414 --> 00:08:56,816
It starts-- it star--
gee, thank you.

203
00:08:59,126 --> 00:09:01,788
You're welcome?

204
00:09:10,211 --> 00:09:11,277
Hey, Ed.

205
00:09:11,345 --> 00:09:12,579
Oh, there you are.

206
00:09:12,647 --> 00:09:14,147
I got your emergency text.
What's the problem?

207
00:09:14,215 --> 00:09:15,516
Yeah, uh...

208
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,618
You see
the fetching sandwich lady

209
00:09:17,685 --> 00:09:19,853
over there? Hmm?

210
00:09:21,556 --> 00:09:22,789
What's her name?

211
00:09:22,857 --> 00:09:24,858
Uh... Jackie.

212
00:09:24,926 --> 00:09:26,726
J-Jackie! Yes, that's it.

213
00:09:26,793 --> 00:09:28,928
Thank you
very much. Thank you thanks.

214
00:09:28,996 --> 00:09:30,897
This is precisely why

215
00:09:30,964 --> 00:09:34,033
I never wanted you to have
my cell phone number.

216
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,369
- Come on now, come on now.
- Now why the frosty tone?

217
00:09:37,437 --> 00:09:39,371
Gee, I'm sorry, Ed,
but I'm a little busy.

218
00:09:39,439 --> 00:09:42,908
Got to head to the bank with
proper construction permits,

219
00:09:42,975 --> 00:09:44,943
get my brother a loan
so he can build a building

220
00:09:45,011 --> 00:09:47,045
so I can be his boss
so he can resent me

221
00:09:47,112 --> 00:09:48,880
and probably kill me
with a backhoe.

222
00:09:48,948 --> 00:09:50,949
Have a great morning.

223
00:09:51,017 --> 00:09:52,617
Are we still hung up on this?

224
00:09:52,685 --> 00:09:54,786
"Still"?
This just happened yesterday.

225
00:09:54,854 --> 00:09:56,888
Okay, fine, fine, fine.

226
00:09:56,956 --> 00:09:59,790
Look, you pout all the way
to the bank, but remember this--

227
00:09:59,858 --> 00:10:02,392
your brother has been living
a little under your shadow,

228
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,761
and that can't be easy.

229
00:10:03,828 --> 00:10:04,995
What's the point, Ed?

230
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:06,797
Point is it takes
two people to fight.

231
00:10:06,865 --> 00:10:08,498
You don't have to
be one of them.

232
00:10:10,035 --> 00:10:12,069
I hate it when you and my wife

233
00:10:12,136 --> 00:10:14,150
think I'm a better guy
than I really am.

234
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,107
Jackie, yes...

235
00:10:20,243 --> 00:10:21,744
Hello, Jackie.

236
00:10:21,812 --> 00:10:24,577
Who's Jackie?

237
00:10:35,222 --> 00:10:37,125
Look at all of those
cute little old ladies

238
00:10:37,193 --> 00:10:41,719
looking for little old men.
Look at her hat. She's fancy.

239
00:10:42,966 --> 00:10:44,666
What's going on?

240
00:10:44,734 --> 00:10:46,400
Oh, just looking for
a love match for grandpa.

241
00:10:46,468 --> 00:10:47,835
Oh, and, guys,
just so you know,

242
00:10:47,903 --> 00:10:48,836
I set up this couple
at my school,

243
00:10:48,904 --> 00:10:50,004
and now she's pregnant,

244
00:10:50,072 --> 00:10:52,396
so, pretty sure
I know what I'm doing.

245
00:10:58,647 --> 00:11:00,948
Okay. Who do we got?

246
00:11:01,016 --> 00:11:02,482
Oh, okay, um...

247
00:11:02,549 --> 00:11:07,153
"Fun-loving widow looking
for a rugged gentleman to..."

248
00:11:11,025 --> 00:11:14,260
Really? At that age?

249
00:11:18,564 --> 00:11:20,499
I don't even know
why you're here.

250
00:11:20,566 --> 00:11:22,868
I think I know how to ge
a loan for start-up costs.

251
00:11:22,936 --> 00:11:24,169
Listen, I'm just making sure

252
00:11:24,237 --> 00:11:26,371
it's properly licensed
and permitted.

253
00:11:26,439 --> 00:11:28,373
You really are a nerd,
aren't you?

254
00:11:28,441 --> 00:11:29,808
Ugh.

255
00:11:29,876 --> 00:11:30,776
Hi, guys. Richard Clark.

256
00:11:30,844 --> 00:11:31,877
Hey, Richard.

257
00:11:31,945 --> 00:11:32,911
Good to see you again,
Mr. Baxter.

258
00:11:32,979 --> 00:11:34,245
We know each other?

259
00:11:34,312 --> 00:11:35,613
I went to school
with your daughter Kristin.

260
00:11:35,681 --> 00:11:36,914
Ah.

261
00:11:36,982 --> 00:11:40,417
Tell her Richard says, "hello."

262
00:11:40,485 --> 00:11:42,620
Why are you laughing at that?

263
00:11:42,688 --> 00:11:45,123
I'm thinking he got some.

264
00:11:47,325 --> 00:11:48,425
You asked a qutition

265
00:11:48,493 --> 00:11:50,127
and, uh, you must be
James Baxter,

266
00:11:50,194 --> 00:11:51,128
the loan applicant.

267
00:11:51,195 --> 00:11:52,529
That's right.

268
00:11:52,596 --> 00:11:55,231
Well, James.

269
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:57,167
Looked over
your request, and...

270
00:11:57,234 --> 00:11:59,870
I've got to say, I'm a little
concerned about your assets.

271
00:11:59,937 --> 00:12:02,091
"Concerned" how, Spanky?

272
00:12:05,242 --> 00:12:07,376
- Imagine we're talking about doughnuts.
- Okay.

273
00:12:07,443 --> 00:12:09,845
I wish you had
a large box of doughnuts,

274
00:12:09,913 --> 00:12:13,315
but instead, you've only got,
like, seven doughnuts.

275
00:12:13,383 --> 00:12:14,316
Yeah.

276
00:12:14,384 --> 00:12:16,272
I need more doughnuts.

277
00:12:18,121 --> 00:12:20,222
Look, my brother just needs
seed money for the project.

278
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,657
Mike, I think I got this.

279
00:12:21,724 --> 00:12:23,457
Really?
Doing a good job so far,

280
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:26,728
letting a college sophomore
turn you down for a loan.

281
00:12:26,796 --> 00:12:29,731
Yoyou're, uh...
Yoyou're turning me do?

282
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:33,434
Just, you're a a--
you're a little overextended

283
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,770
what happened
all your doughnuts?

284
00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:38,338
Last couple projects,
we built on spec.

285
00:12:38,372 --> 00:12:40,074
We haven't unloaded'em yet.
It's not a big deal.

286
00:12:40,141 --> 00:12:41,575
Is that what this is about?

287
00:12:41,642 --> 00:12:43,376
- Wait, wait, "on spec"?
- Don't lecture me.

288
00:12:43,477 --> 00:12:44,842
You're not supposed
to use your doughnuts.

289
00:12:46,781 --> 00:12:48,481
I mean, if you have to
use a couple of your doughnuts,

290
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:51,085
then you come to a clown like
this for the other doughnuts.

291
00:12:52,587 --> 00:12:54,721
What are you laughing about?

292
00:12:54,755 --> 00:12:56,122
I'm not.
It's just a nervous tic.

293
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,314
Well, take some medicine.

294
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,362
No way,
I-I think you should reapply,

295
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,598
you know after the economy bounces back.

296
00:13:05,632 --> 00:13:08,300
Yah. That's great come on, Mike.

297
00:13:08,368 --> 00:13:10,902
Wait a sec, wait a second.

298
00:13:12,538 --> 00:13:15,473
Whatt if I cosign the loan as an executive of Outdoor Man?

299
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:16,842
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
- Just listen up.

300
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:18,343
Well, that would certainly
change things.

301
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,212
I'm not asking you to do that.

302
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:21,847
I know you're not,
but you heard Richie Rich.

303
00:13:21,914 --> 00:13:24,216
You're not getting the loan
otherwise.

304
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:29,553
Would you do this
for another contractor?

305
00:13:29,621 --> 00:13:31,321
No.

306
00:13:31,389 --> 00:13:32,389
Right. Forget it.

307
00:13:32,457 --> 00:13:34,191
I may not have
enough doughnuts,

308
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:35,692
but I still have my pride.
No deal.

309
00:13:35,761 --> 00:13:37,194
Don't be a baby about this.

310
00:13:37,262 --> 00:13:39,163
"Baby"?
Hey, I'm not being a baby.

311
00:13:39,231 --> 00:13:42,232
- I am the one who stayed home with dad...
- Oh, start this...

312
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:44,768
- Start this--
- and kept the family business going while you ran off.

313
00:13:44,835 --> 00:13:45,902
- "Ran off"?
- Yeah.

314
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,203
- How about college?
- Anyway, anyway...

315
00:13:47,271 --> 00:13:48,071
How about getting a career
and all that stuff?

316
00:13:48,139 --> 00:13:49,372
Thanks for coming in, and...

317
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,374
Tell Kristin
that I own my own car now.

318
00:13:51,441 --> 00:13:52,942
Sit down, sport.
Look at this.

319
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,578
We came here for a loan,
so don't be a martyr about dad.

320
00:13:55,646 --> 00:13:56,780
The only reason
<i>you</i> stayed with dad,

321
00:13:56,847 --> 00:13:59,514
'cause it was cheaper
and easier to do that.

322
00:13:59,582 --> 00:14:02,951
- <i>You</i> ran away.
- When we get out that parking lot,

323
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:04,386
- <i>you'll</i> be running away.
- Oh, <i>I'm</i> gonna be running away.

324
00:14:04,453 --> 00:14:06,088
Unless you want to go here.

325
00:14:06,156 --> 00:14:07,522
- I would go here, yes.
- Let's do that. Let's go here.

326
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,124
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

327
00:14:09,192 --> 00:14:10,793
I'm thinking the parking lot
might be better for fighting.

328
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,127
There's more room.
It's well-lit.

329
00:14:12,195 --> 00:14:13,762
There's a little clinic
right across the street,

330
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:16,397
in case you get hurt.

331
00:14:16,464 --> 00:14:18,766
You're right, kid.

332
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:26,465
All right, now I want you
to keep an open mind,

333
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,367
because love comes
in many forms.

334
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:29,903
Who are these women?

335
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,604
You're gonna pick that one,

336
00:14:31,672 --> 00:14:32,905
and then you're gonna
ask her out,

337
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,173
and then you won't
be lonely anymore,

338
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,908
and it's all because of me!

339
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,910
Mandy.

340
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,244
- Full disclosure...
- Yeah.

341
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:41,046
I've got a girlfriend.

342
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:42,981
What?

343
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:47,652
Her name is Stella,
and she's a real spitfire.

344
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,489
So you can't go to a senior
square dance at Nibblers?

345
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:57,661
No, thanks. I'm more
of a salsa guy, anyway.

346
00:14:58,997 --> 00:15:00,998
See you later.

347
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,466
Where you going?

348
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:05,468
Meeting up with a hot grandma
for dinner, dancing, and then

349
00:15:05,536 --> 00:15:08,772
after that, we're gonna see
where the afternoon takes us.

350
00:15:10,374 --> 00:15:11,908
Yee-haw.

351
00:15:14,411 --> 00:15:16,947
Hey, dad.

352
00:15:17,014 --> 00:15:18,514
I am so glad you're here.

353
00:15:18,582 --> 00:15:19,549
Me, too.

354
00:15:19,617 --> 00:15:20,515
Yeah.

355
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:21,817
Isn't it great,

356
00:15:21,885 --> 00:15:24,987
the way Jim and Mike
are getting along so well?

357
00:15:25,055 --> 00:15:27,757
Hmm.
That's your impression

358
00:15:27,824 --> 00:15:30,159
of what's happening
around here?

359
00:15:30,227 --> 00:15:31,460
Ah...

360
00:15:31,527 --> 00:15:33,362
They tussle
about this and that,

361
00:15:33,429 --> 00:15:35,397
but they're gonna love
working together.

362
00:15:36,732 --> 00:15:38,366
You're just trying
to show me up,

363
00:15:38,433 --> 00:15:40,534
like I can't
get a loan on my own.

364
00:15:40,602 --> 00:15:42,937
Because you <i>can't</i>
get the loan on your own!

365
00:15:43,005 --> 00:15:45,106
- What happened?
- I didn't get the loan.

366
00:15:45,174 --> 00:15:47,375
He could have got the loan
if he weren't so stubborn!

367
00:15:47,442 --> 00:15:48,843
- Oh--
- just let me cosign for it--

368
00:15:48,911 --> 00:15:50,311
pop, there are
a million other projects

369
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:51,679
you and I could be working on

370
00:15:51,747 --> 00:15:54,481
without having to deal
with all <i>this.</i>

371
00:15:56,484 --> 00:15:58,718
What do the hand gestures mean?

372
00:15:58,787 --> 00:16:00,087
It means you're not fooling me.

373
00:16:00,155 --> 00:16:02,156
You're trying
to rub my face in it

374
00:16:02,223 --> 00:16:03,690
and make me feel like a loser.

375
00:16:03,758 --> 00:16:05,793
Or maybe it's a brother trying
to help another brother out,

376
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,927
- who deserves a shot. Maybe that's all!
- All right, all right. Stop!

377
00:16:07,995 --> 00:16:09,461
I've had enough
of you two guys!

378
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:12,598
Neither one of you's too big
to put over my knee replacement.

379
00:16:18,205 --> 00:16:19,906
You know what, pop?

380
00:16:19,973 --> 00:16:22,175
I can't deal with this guy.

381
00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:24,609
The project is dead.
All right?

382
00:16:24,677 --> 00:16:26,311
If you need me, I'll be in the RV,

383
00:16:26,378 --> 00:16:28,780
opening a can of beans.

384
00:16:28,848 --> 00:16:31,817
Not the beans! The beans are for
when the government takes over!

385
00:16:37,523 --> 00:16:40,124
What is going on here?

386
00:16:40,192 --> 00:16:42,026
You know what?

387
00:16:42,093 --> 00:16:43,694
Maybe this isn't
just about you and Jimmy

388
00:16:43,761 --> 00:16:45,830
and-- and building a store.

389
00:16:45,897 --> 00:16:47,531
What do you mean?

390
00:16:47,598 --> 00:16:48,799
Look at what
your father did to the paper.

391
00:16:50,068 --> 00:16:52,937
Hillary's always
had a mustache.

392
00:16:55,906 --> 00:16:59,742
No, the real estate section.
He's circling apartment ads.

393
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,911
Your father wants to move here.

394
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,179
Why?

395
00:17:03,247 --> 00:17:05,215
"Why?" "Why?"
Because the project's here,

396
00:17:05,282 --> 00:17:08,151
his family's here.
I mean, just put it together.

397
00:17:08,219 --> 00:17:10,186
He wants to be near
his granddaughters,

398
00:17:10,254 --> 00:17:12,321
his great-grandson, <i>you.</i>

399
00:17:12,388 --> 00:17:15,858
And for God sake, the van
does say "Baxter & <i>sons."</i>

400
00:17:17,727 --> 00:17:21,864
You figured all that out
by these red circles, huh?

401
00:17:21,931 --> 00:17:24,266
It's a knack.

402
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,869
Never let 'em tell you
women aren't smart.

403
00:17:30,805 --> 00:17:31,939
Who said that?

404
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:33,374
It's not important.

405
00:17:33,441 --> 00:17:35,442
Who? Who?

406
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,978
- I-I--
- Is it somebody at work?

407
00:17:37,045 --> 00:17:38,246
- No, it's not--
- Give me a name. Name one person.

408
00:17:38,313 --> 00:17:39,947
- No, I'm not sa--
- one per-- name one person.

409
00:17:40,015 --> 00:17:41,916
Was it the idiots
down at the loading dock?

410
00:17:41,984 --> 00:17:44,251
- Forget the loading dock...
- Can't think of anybody?

411
00:17:48,555 --> 00:17:50,357
What are you guys doing here?

412
00:17:50,424 --> 00:17:52,859
What are <i>you</i> doing here?

413
00:17:52,927 --> 00:17:56,396
It's my office.

414
00:17:56,463 --> 00:17:59,866
Ooh. Mike has an office.

415
00:18:01,467 --> 00:18:03,402
Ed called us here.

416
00:18:03,469 --> 00:18:04,803
He's not gonna
change my mind, pop.

417
00:18:04,871 --> 00:18:07,106
I'd rather build taco stands
for the rest of my life

418
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:09,942
than have him cosign a loan
and lord it over me.

419
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:13,078
Jim, does he lord it over you
that he saved your butt

420
00:18:13,146 --> 00:18:16,680
from that bully, Andy O'Connell,
in the seventh grade?

421
00:18:16,748 --> 00:18:19,984
How do you even remember
that kid's name?

422
00:18:20,052 --> 00:18:22,420
- Because Mike always--
- Dad, dad, dad.

423
00:18:28,493 --> 00:18:29,994
Oh, good.

424
00:18:30,062 --> 00:18:32,129
You'll all here.

425
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:33,596
All right.

426
00:18:33,664 --> 00:18:35,032
Gentlemen...

427
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:38,568
I'm giving the project over
to my second choice...

428
00:18:38,636 --> 00:18:39,970
Trumbull.

429
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:41,704
Case closed.

430
00:18:41,772 --> 00:18:44,141
Trumbull?

431
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,743
All right, you idiots.
You happy now?

432
00:18:47,912 --> 00:18:49,578
Ed. Those guys
are gangsters, man.

433
00:18:49,646 --> 00:18:51,047
They're gonna gouge you.

434
00:18:51,114 --> 00:18:53,082
Ed, Jim's right.
They're thieves. You know that.

435
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,884
Eh, maybe, but they're thieves
with heavy equipment and, uh,

436
00:18:55,953 --> 00:18:59,121
an experienced crew,
and no infighting.

437
00:18:59,189 --> 00:19:02,391
Ed, wait.

438
00:19:02,459 --> 00:19:04,993
You're gonna let him do this?
What?

439
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,594
What am I supposed
to do about it?

440
00:19:09,098 --> 00:19:12,367
I... cosign the loan.

441
00:19:12,435 --> 00:19:14,902
Why don't you use
your big-guy voice?

442
00:19:22,543 --> 00:19:24,445
Cosign the loan.

443
00:19:24,512 --> 00:19:27,614
Anything's better than giving
the business to those crooks.

444
00:19:27,682 --> 00:19:31,485
I thought you said
it made you feel a <i>loser.</i>

445
00:19:33,221 --> 00:19:36,356
Yeah, but then pop pointed out

446
00:19:36,423 --> 00:19:39,092
that your desk
doesn't have any drawers,

447
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:42,495
so I feel a little better
about myself.

448
00:19:42,562 --> 00:19:46,466
It's very stylish.
Just don't call it a desk.

449
00:19:48,502 --> 00:19:50,470
Are you all right with this?

450
00:19:50,537 --> 00:19:52,770
Look, Mike,
if you're still willing...

451
00:19:52,838 --> 00:19:54,772
Yeah, I'm good.

452
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,174
I'm willing. Let's do it.

453
00:19:56,242 --> 00:19:57,275
All right.
All right.

454
00:19:57,343 --> 00:19:59,211
Baxter &...

455
00:19:59,278 --> 00:20:01,146
- Sons.
- Yeah.

456
00:20:01,214 --> 00:20:03,615
This is a great day.
What happens next?

457
00:20:03,682 --> 00:20:05,350
I drive us to the bank.

458
00:20:05,418 --> 00:20:06,385
We'll use my car.

459
00:20:06,452 --> 00:20:08,652
You kind of drive
like miss Daisy.

460
00:20:10,855 --> 00:20:12,823
Well, actually, miss Daisy
didn't drive the car.

461
00:20:12,891 --> 00:20:14,225
That was the point
of the movie, you moron.

462
00:20:16,261 --> 00:20:17,694
I'll drive.

463
00:20:17,762 --> 00:20:19,330
Whoa, hey, you--

464
00:20:19,398 --> 00:20:20,531
- Mike is a fine driver.
- No, you go ahead.

465
00:20:20,598 --> 00:20:22,033
- Would you drive?
- No problem.

466
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,934
- I'm super confident.
- You just sit, dad.

467
00:20:24,002 --> 00:20:25,368
- Kind of slow, but we'll get there.
- Not driving a tractor.

468
00:20:25,436 --> 00:20:27,570
We could even take
his old truck.

469
00:20:27,638 --> 00:20:30,073
- I'll tell you what, I'd rather take--
- you're such a-- you know what?

470
00:20:35,698 --> 00:20:37,683
Yeah, Jim Baxter here
for Outdoor Man,

471
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:39,904
letting you know that
we're, uh, locked and loaded

472
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,541
- for our big sale on over-under shotguns.
- Come on, brother, brother, come on, lookit.

473
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,342
Lookit. <i>"Locked</i> and loaded." Punch the words.

474
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,810
<i>"Locked"--
"locked</i> and loaded."

475
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:47,478
I can think of something
I'd like to punch, honestly.

476
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:48,745
Is this like Andy O'Connell?

477
00:20:48,813 --> 00:20:50,447
If I hadn't
yanked the kid off you,

478
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:52,183
- he would have kicked your ass. Instead, I kicked his ass...
- Hey.

479
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,117
- And you look far better--
- you know what? It's time to go.

480
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:55,653
- Oh, let's do it.
- Come on.

481
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:06,262
Hoo. Still is big brother
around <i>here.</i>

482
00:21:10,668 --> 00:21:12,134
Hey...

483
00:21:15,706 --> 00:21:17,973
Mike Baxter here
for Outdoor Man.

484
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:21,009
We are locked and loaded
for our new-- look who's up.

485
00:21:21,077 --> 00:21:22,611
Hey, remember me?

486
00:21:25,381 --> 00:21:27,115
Aah!

487
00:21:27,183 --> 00:21:28,783
Let go of that!

488
00:21:28,851 --> 00:21:29,951
Aah!

489
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:33,886
