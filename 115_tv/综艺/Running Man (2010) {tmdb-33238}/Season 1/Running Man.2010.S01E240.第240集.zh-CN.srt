133
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,835
- 这个... - 没有
- Well... - No, no.

134
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:19,636
Adam正要送我出门
Adam was just walking me to the door

135
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:22,306
他可是世上最浪漫的丈夫了

139
00:05:28,386 --> 00:05:30,889
等等
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

140
00:05:32,616 --> 00:05:34,079
好的 她刚刚有点意识混乱
Okay, okay, she was confused for a minute,

141
00:05:34,103 --> 00:05:35,539
- 不过现在没事走了 - 喔

142
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,388
听着 我要和你谈谈钢人队的比赛
Okay, listen, I got to talk to you about the Steelers game.

143
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:38,484
我来这里就是为了这个 
That's why I'm here! 

144
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:39,724
我先说会好点
Let me do mine first. It's better.

145
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,286
我给咱们订了
I ordered us,

146
00:05:41,311 --> 00:05:42,510
次日达的空运件
via next day air...

147
00:05:42,535 --> 00:05:44,362
你也知道的 我不愿买的...
which you know I hate to pay for...

148
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:49,368
钢人队1976年的旧球衣
vintage 1976 Steelers jerseys.

149
00:05:49,696 --> 00:05:52,398
算是你请我看比赛的一点小心意 
A little thank you for taking me to the game.

152
00:05:57,072 --> 00:05:58,475
我都不知道要说什么了
I don't know what to say.

153
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:01,078
我说吧 我是个好兄弟
Well, I'll say it. I'm a good guy.

154
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:02,879
好兄弟
You are.

155
00:06:02,912 --> 00:06:03,948
你也是我的好兄弟
And you're a good guy, too.

156
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,682
也不...
Eh. Not...

157
00:06:05,707 --> 00:06:07,609
不 你请我看比赛意义重大
No, no, no, no, it means a lot.

158
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:10,291
我们是看着钢人队长大的 这是属于我们的回忆
We grew up watching the Steelers. It's our thing.

159
00:06:10,316 --> 00:06:11,489
是吗
Is it?

160
00:06:12,281 --> 00:06:12,976
真的是
And is it

161
00:06:13,001 --> 00:06:15,003
我们的独家回忆吗
exclusively our thing?

162
00:06:16,282 --> 00:06:17,215
我意思是
I mean, you know,

163
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,097
你大可邀请Andi去 可你最后选了谁呢
you could've easily invited Andi, but who'd you pick?

164
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:22,556
是我
Me. 

165
00:06:23,134 --> 00:06:25,292
我不太喜欢通过身体表达情感
You know, I'm not much for physical displays of affection,

166
00:06:25,317 --> 00:06:28,222
不过我这次豁出去了
but I'm gonna give you one of these.

167
00:06:31,544 --> 00:06:33,143
拍了三下
Wow. Three pats?

168
00:06:33,176 --> 00:06:35,979
比我结婚那天还多了两下
That's two more than my wedding day.

169
00:06:36,013 --> 00:06:37,849
别告诉别人这件事
Don't tell the guys at work about this.

170
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:39,327
我不想让他们觉得我是娘娘腔
I don't want them to think I'm a sissy.

172
00:06:41,684 --> 00:06:42,649
-  爸 再见 - 爸 再见
- Bye, Dad! - Bye, Dad!

173
00:06:42,673 --> 00:06:43,486
再见
Bye!

175
00:06:45,422 --> 00:06:47,691
你要去哪里 Burns先生

需要我回家解决
a pressing family situation I need to handle,

179
00:06:53,898 --> 00:06:55,934
再说我不想开讨论会
I don't want to go to that.

180
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,607
你就盯着我看吗
So, what, are you just gonna stare at me?

181
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,650
你觉得这样吓唬得了我吗
You think that's gonna intimidate me?

182
00:07:10,658 --> 00:07:12,912
我们讨论会或见分晓
Well, we'll find out after the seminar.

183
00:07:13,996 --> 00:07:15,432
Adam

186
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,963

I don't know if you heard, but Lowell saved you a seat.

187
00:07:21,988 --> 00:07:24,429
好 谢谢
Yeah. Thanks.

188
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,134
欢迎各位家长

Today's topic will be: "How to stop playground bullying."

190
00:07:29,766 --> 00:07:32,223
开会前 我先道个歉
Before we begin, I'd like to apologize

191
00:07:32,248 --> 00:07:33,745
没有给大家提供茶点
for the lack of refreshments.

192
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,475
若有不满 请自行
If you have any complaints, please feel free

193
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,801
向轮值家长Burns先生诉说
to direct them to your room parent, Mr. Burns.

194
00:07:40,395 --> 00:07:41,845
我有个问题
Okay, I got a question.

195
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:42,796
可以吧
All right?

196
00:07:42,821 --> 00:07:44,798
我们半个小时不喝水
What has happened in society

197
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:47,578
家长会会出事吗
that we can't go 30 minutes without a water?

199
00:07:48,373 --> 00:07:49,363
我们不需要水
We don't need water.

200
00:07:49,388 --> 00:07:52,157
我们要的是挖条地道 离开这里
What we need is a way to tunnel out of here!

201
00:07:53,148 --> 00:07:54,025
说完了吗 Burns先生
You done, Mr. Burns?

202
00:07:55,098 --> 00:07:56,540
我说完了
Yeah, I've said my piece.

203
00:07:58,322 --> 00:08:00,524
小组进行情景讨论时
So as you continue to workshop scenarios

204
00:08:00,549 --> 00:08:03,586
要是孩子受到欺凌
in your smaller groups, remember the watch word

205
00:08:03,619 --> 00:08:05,554
记得我们的关键步骤
for when your child feels bullied:

206
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:08,490
"起身 交谈 离开"
"Stand up, Talk, Depart."

207
00:08:08,523 --> 00:08:10,559
{\an8}STD 性传播疾病

207
00:08:08,523 --> 00:08:10,559
STD
STD.

208
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:14,429
好吧
All right?

209
00:08:21,035 --> 00:08:22,971
就叫"起身 交谈 离开"吧
Let's just call it "Stand up, Talk, Depart."

210
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:27,543
没错 欺凌行为是最恶劣的
Yeah, bullying is the worst.

211
00:08:28,472 --> 00:08:29,974
就这两个人
Okay, so now I got two people

212
00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:32,103
我现在是要选谁和我去看比赛
who think they're going to the game with me.

213
00:08:32,128 --> 00:08:34,369
要是他们又碰面了
If they run into each other again, this whole thing

214
00:08:34,394 --> 00:08:35,599
你要完蛋了
is gonna blow up in my face...

215
00:08:35,624 --> 00:08:37,580
说威胁我的话
said that bully to me.

216
00:08:39,991 --> 00:08:41,656
你要带你妻子去看比赛
You know you got to take your wife to the game.

217
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,694
我拿趣多多给孩子当作早餐 连我都这么觉得
I fed my kids Chips Ahoy! for breakfast, and even I know that.

218
00:08:44,726 --> 00:08:46,928
不是 我知道了
No. I know, I know.

219
00:08:47,506 --> 00:08:49,865
我现在就要去做 跟Don说明白
Now I just got to get to work and break it to Don.

220
00:08:50,701 --> 00:08:52,356
问题是我怎么出去呢
Question is: how do I get out of here?

221
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:53,527
这就难了
This is tough.

222
00:08:53,552 --> 00:08:55,409
我意思是 换做是我 我会问我自己
I mean, if it were me, I would ask myself,

223
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:58,404
"Adam会怎么办" 可你就是Adam啊
"What would Adam do?" but you're Adam.

224
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,738
连你都不知道
And you don't know.

225
00:09:02,238 --> 00:09:04,347
那可能没人知道了
It might be unknowable.

226
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:06,682
你们俩个太可爱了
You guys are so cute together.

227
00:09:08,176 --> 00:09:10,567
Marie 你说的这话
Marie, it doesn't sound like you're talking about

228
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,159
不该在会上说吧
what you're supposed to be talking about.

229
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,286
不好意思 Rodriguez女士
Excuse me, Mrs. Rodriguez.

230
00:09:15,018 --> 00:09:17,655
我觉得你在欺负我的好朋友
I think you're bullying my good friend.

231
00:09:18,527 --> 00:09:21,489
我要起身
So I will stand up...

232
00:09:22,381 --> 00:09:25,746
交谈 然后离开
talk... and depart.

233
00:09:31,102 --> 00:09:33,239
没错 我所做的就是STD
That's right... I just gave you an STD.

234
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:43,294
- Andi -嘿
- Andi. - Hey.

235
00:09:43,319 --> 00:09:45,389
Don
And Don.

236
00:09:45,991 --> 00:09:48,194
真是"惊"喜啊
What a heart-stopping surprise.

237
00:09:49,074 --> 00:09:51,284
你们两个怎么在一块了呢
What are you two unlikely buddies up to?

238
00:09:51,309 --> 00:09:52,861
我们聊天而已
Oh, just gabbing...

239
00:09:53,081 --> 00:09:55,083
说到你到Andi去看钢人队的比赛
about you taking Andi to the Steelers game.

240
00:09:55,526 --> 00:09:57,065
真是个幸运的女子
What a lucky girl.
