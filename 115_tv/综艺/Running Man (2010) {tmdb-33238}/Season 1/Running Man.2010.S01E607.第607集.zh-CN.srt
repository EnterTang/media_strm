1
00:00:31,818 --> 00:00:33,217
Wait...

2
00:00:34,153 --> 00:00:36,314
...I have a surprise for you.

3
00:00:36,856 --> 00:00:37,982
I like surprises...

4
00:00:39,092 --> 00:00:41,060
...but I don't like to wait.

5
00:00:44,063 --> 00:00:47,396
It'll be worth it. Trust me.

6
00:01:17,196 --> 00:01:18,185
Shut up!

7
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:22,327
Come on, get up!

8
00:01:25,505 --> 00:01:27,097
Give it to him!

9
00:01:29,976 --> 00:01:31,603
Come on.

10
00:01:34,514 --> 00:01:36,004
Yeah.

11
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:48,452
- Come on.
- You want some of this?

12
00:01:49,362 --> 00:01:50,886
They don't.

13
00:01:51,397 --> 00:01:52,523
But I do.

14
00:02:29,102 --> 00:02:30,797
Oliver?

15
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:42,174
Okay, I'm pretty open minded, but kinky
hide-and-seek really isn't my game.

16
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:52,157
Okay, you win.

17
00:02:52,692 --> 00:02:55,957
Olly olly whatever-whatever.

18
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,965
Okay, oliver, this isn't funny.

19
00:03:02,135 --> 00:03:03,830
Where are you?

20
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,178
Good one, Lois.

21
00:03:15,615 --> 00:03:19,051
Don't worry, cops will have a key.

22
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:23,884
Surprise.

23
00:04:43,676 --> 00:04:47,203
Mom, I have a big appetite, but you've
got enough food here to feed an army.

24
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,975
I thought it'd be a good idea to invite
a few people over for Thanksgiving.

25
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,608
Actually, I was hoping
we could keep it low-key.

26
00:04:54,787 --> 00:04:56,687
I'm not feeling very thankful this year.

27
00:04:56,856 --> 00:05:00,622
It's going to be a hard day, especially
after what just happened to Raya...

28
00:05:00,793 --> 00:05:03,956
...but company could help.

29
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,395
It was Dad's holiday.
He carved the turkey.

30
00:05:08,034 --> 00:05:10,229
I can carve this year.

31
00:05:11,404 --> 00:05:15,306
Mom, he was the one who made sure
we all said what we were thankful for.

32
00:05:16,476 --> 00:05:19,377
He always made sure
that I was thankful for my abilities...

33
00:05:19,545 --> 00:05:21,172
...but you know what? He was wrong.

34
00:05:22,381 --> 00:05:25,009
If I was normal,
he would still be here...

35
00:05:26,085 --> 00:05:28,918
...carving the turkey
with grandpa's old carving knife.

36
00:05:33,326 --> 00:05:34,816
Hey.

37
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:38,658
So you can scratch oliver's name
off the Thanksgiving guest list...

38
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:42,028
...or any other guest list, for that matter.

39
00:05:43,736 --> 00:05:44,794
I'm solo.

40
00:05:44,971 --> 00:05:46,962
Well, that's too bad. What happened?

41
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,837
Last night he pulled another one
of his trademark disappearing acts...

42
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,534
...smack in the middle of a date.

43
00:05:52,712 --> 00:05:55,146
Well, I'm sorry, Lois.

44
00:05:55,748 --> 00:05:59,650
Oh, don't be. I mean, who's kidding
who here? We had no future.

45
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:03,084
He's a world-renowned billionaire,
and I am a nail-biting...

46
00:06:03,256 --> 00:06:05,224
...Talon-dwelling, tabloid reporter.

47
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:08,383
Lois, I'm sure you'll find someone
who's better suited for you.

48
00:06:08,561 --> 00:06:11,155
Yeah, I know, I know, life goes on.

49
00:06:12,532 --> 00:06:15,330
At least for some people.
Have you heard the news?

50
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:18,398
The Green Arrow was shot last night.

51
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:21,370
It's in today's <i>Planet</i>.

52
00:06:23,543 --> 00:06:24,771
A man found him bleeding...

53
00:06:24,944 --> 00:06:27,469
...and ran for help.
When the cops finally got there...

54
00:06:27,647 --> 00:06:29,808
...all that was left was a bloodstain.

55
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,049
Lex.

56
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:46,259
I found the charitable organization
I want to focus on.

57
00:06:46,432 --> 00:06:48,423
It's Second Chance Halfway House.

58
00:06:49,335 --> 00:06:52,270
I have the time, and I heard you
mention them on the phone...

59
00:06:52,438 --> 00:06:54,838
...and then I found this brochure.

60
00:06:55,007 --> 00:06:56,702
What an amazing program.

61
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:59,606
I don't see why
they can't be in every city in the country.

62
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:00,871
Lana...

63
00:07:01,047 --> 00:07:05,006
...you'd be in contact with violent
criminals just released from prison.

64
00:07:05,418 --> 00:07:08,751
Maybe from time to time,
but mostly I'd be at the central office.

65
00:07:09,755 --> 00:07:12,315
Why not channel your energy
into the Youth Foundation...

66
00:07:12,491 --> 00:07:14,220
...or the Center for Victim's Rights?

67
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,793
Because this is what I want to do.

68
00:07:16,963 --> 00:07:19,454
I'm just trying to protect you.

69
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:24,931
What is it with people feeling
like they have to protect me?

70
00:07:25,104 --> 00:07:28,267
Lex, I don't need to be watched over.

71
00:07:28,441 --> 00:07:31,569
I didn't say you did.
I want you to be safe.

72
00:07:31,744 --> 00:07:34,611
Well, this isn't about what you want.

73
00:07:35,248 --> 00:07:37,216
This is about what I want.

74
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,314
Pick any other project.

75
00:07:41,053 --> 00:07:42,782
I'm sorry.

76
00:08:08,047 --> 00:08:10,311
You're looking awfully healthy.

77
00:08:12,251 --> 00:08:14,116
It's called exercise, Clark.

78
00:08:14,287 --> 00:08:16,482
Something mortals
have to do from time to time.

79
00:08:16,656 --> 00:08:18,180
According to <i>The Daily Planet</i>...

80
00:08:18,357 --> 00:08:20,757
...the Green Arrow was shot last night.

81
00:08:20,926 --> 00:08:23,895
If I was shot, don't you think
I'd be in a hospital or a morgue?

82
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:26,122
I'm not bulletproof like you are, Clark.

83
00:08:26,299 --> 00:08:29,598
Besides, you should know better
than to believe everything...

84
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:31,134
...you read in the newspaper.

85
00:08:31,304 --> 00:08:35,673
It's <i>The Daily Planet</i>, not the <i>Inquisitor</i>.
A witness saw you lying in a pool of blood.

86
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:39,139
Maybe it was someone else
with a preference for green.

87
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:48,484
What's your Green Arrow gear
doing in the middle of the room?

88
00:08:49,121 --> 00:08:52,352
I'm uploading a video.
Check this out.

89
00:08:56,329 --> 00:08:57,887
See that?

90
00:08:58,397 --> 00:09:01,491
Now I've got footage of the scumbags,
so if they try to get away...

91
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:03,601
...I can track them down.

92
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:05,259
Oliver, you're getting sloppy.

93
00:09:05,438 --> 00:09:09,033
Your gear's out in the room, the door's
unlocked. That could have been Lois.

94
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,733
Yeah. You know what?
I've had a lot on my mind lately.

95
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:14,209
You were too busy using your powers
to bale hay...

96
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,213
...than to realize
there's a crime wave in Metropolis.

97
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:20,442
Let me ask you a question.

98
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,980
Are you ever gonna get off your ass
and do something for a change?

99
00:09:24,156 --> 00:09:26,488
- I didn't come to be insulted.
- There's the door.

100
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:30,220
- I don't remember you being invited.
- Oliver, what's going on with you?

101
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,863
I don't need advice from someone
whose only worry in life...

102
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:36,729
...is to protect his identity.
- That's a lie, you know it.

103
00:09:36,902 --> 00:09:40,429
Let me tell you, when I'm on the streets,
I'm protecting people, all right?

104
00:09:40,606 --> 00:09:43,439
I got much bigger things
to worry about. Like staying alive.

105
00:09:53,085 --> 00:09:54,279
Are you okay?

106
00:09:55,454 --> 00:09:58,048
- I'm fine, just get out of here. Go!
- You sure?

107
00:10:47,544 --> 00:10:49,171
Come in.

108
00:10:51,381 --> 00:10:54,179
When did you turn the apartment
into a florist shop?

109
00:10:54,351 --> 00:10:56,182
They're from oliver.

110
00:10:56,553 --> 00:10:59,249
Wait a second.
The guy smothers you with flowers...

111
00:10:59,422 --> 00:11:02,880
...and you forget everything he's done?
- Please, I'm not that gullible.

112
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:07,223
The whole botanical overkill
was just a lame attempt to beg forgiveness.

113
00:11:07,397 --> 00:11:11,424
Well, if he shows up in person to beg
for forgiveness, don't answer the door.

114
00:11:12,002 --> 00:11:14,596
Lois, I went to talk to him
at his apartment.

115
00:11:15,005 --> 00:11:18,065
You didn't. What were you thinking?

116
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:21,938
- I was looking out for you.
- I have 20/20 vision. I look out for myself.

117
00:11:22,112 --> 00:11:25,912
When I was in his apartment,
I found a needle and a syringe.

118
00:11:26,082 --> 00:11:29,643
Unless they're doctor-prescribed,
I think oliver's doing drugs.

119
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,687
This actually explains a lot.
All those times he disappeared.

120
00:11:37,193 --> 00:11:38,922
I should have known.

121
00:11:39,095 --> 00:11:43,589
He said that Thanksgiving was a hard time
of year, made him think about his parents.

122
00:11:43,767 --> 00:11:46,759
Lois, I think you might wanna
keep your distance.

123
00:11:48,371 --> 00:11:51,204
He has a substance abuse problem,
not leprosy.

124
00:11:51,374 --> 00:11:54,002
I'm not going to abandon him
when he needs me the most.

125
00:11:54,177 --> 00:11:56,543
He's not himself now.
Based on his behavior...

126
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,144
...I don't think
he's someone you wanna be around.

127
00:11:59,316 --> 00:12:02,012
Well, see, that's the difference
between you and me, Clark.

128
00:12:02,185 --> 00:12:04,847
I don't desert people
when they need help.

129
00:12:11,461 --> 00:12:14,396
- You're a miracle worker, doc.
- We need to talk, Mr. Queen.

130
00:12:14,864 --> 00:12:16,388
We certainly do.

131
00:12:16,566 --> 00:12:20,366
I finally found myself injured
badly enough to use the RL65...

132
00:12:20,537 --> 00:12:22,971
...and it works perfectly.

133
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,236
Not just once. I cut my hand,
and after one injection...

134
00:12:26,409 --> 00:12:27,637
...I was completely healed.

135
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:31,445
Well, don't take any more.

136
00:12:31,614 --> 00:12:34,310
Last time I checked, doctor,
you worked for me.

137
00:12:34,484 --> 00:12:37,510
The lab mice have been exhibiting
irrational cognitive behavior...

138
00:12:37,687 --> 00:12:41,748
...and more troubling, violent tendencies.
- I'm not a mouse, I feel fine.

139
00:12:42,158 --> 00:12:46,322
Do you? No lapses in judgment?
No sudden outbursts of anger?

140
00:12:48,264 --> 00:12:51,495
Not really, but I am starting
to feel one coming on right now.

141
00:12:51,668 --> 00:12:55,434
It's not worth risking possible psychosis
just so you can climb Mount Everest...

142
00:12:55,605 --> 00:12:57,368
...or parachute out of your Learjet.

143
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,737
This isn't about
my recreational activities, doctor.

144
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:05,176
We're on the verge of a medical
breakthrough that can save countless lives.

145
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:08,574
I'm more than honored
to be the guinea pig.

146
00:13:15,325 --> 00:13:19,523
Trust me, I can handle
the occasional temper tantrum.

147
00:13:26,403 --> 00:13:29,804
Okay, well,
I'll talk to you after the break, senator.

148
00:13:31,841 --> 00:13:35,072
You have a happy Thanksgiving too.
Bye-bye.

149
00:13:40,283 --> 00:13:41,307
- Hi.
- Hi.

150
00:13:41,484 --> 00:13:43,714
Come on in.
I was just about to call you.

151
00:13:43,887 --> 00:13:46,321
I didn't get your R.S.V.P.

152
00:13:46,489 --> 00:13:48,719
Well, that is why I'm here.

153
00:13:48,892 --> 00:13:50,484
I...

154
00:13:52,562 --> 00:13:55,156
...came in person to tell you that...

155
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:57,299
...I won't be coming for...

156
00:13:58,768 --> 00:13:59,928
...Thanksgiving dinner.

157
00:14:00,103 --> 00:14:03,800
Well, that's too bad.
I was really looking forward to seeing you.

158
00:14:05,341 --> 00:14:10,540
After Lillian died, I somehow decided that
I would stop celebrating Thanksgiving.

159
00:14:10,713 --> 00:14:13,181
Why don't you make an exception
and celebrate with us?

160
00:14:13,349 --> 00:14:14,816
We'd really love to have you.

161
00:14:17,153 --> 00:14:19,917
I don't think Clark would agree.

162
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:26,324
The holiday's going to be difficult this
year, without extra complications for him.

163
00:14:26,496 --> 00:14:29,431
You're not a complication, Lionel.

164
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:36,267
You're a part of my life now,
and I'm very thankful for that.

165
00:14:39,843 --> 00:14:41,504
Do you know what that means to me?

166
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,007
Do you know what you mean to me?

167
00:14:57,126 --> 00:14:58,957
Martha, I...

168
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:05,492
I didn't mean to...

169
00:15:05,668 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:15:08,938 --> 00:15:10,838
I'm so sorry.

171
00:15:21,217 --> 00:15:24,584
- I take it this wasn't a party favor.
- I broke into his apartment.

172
00:15:24,754 --> 00:15:28,485
- There might be some residue still left.
- I call oliver Queen a lot of things...

173
00:15:28,658 --> 00:15:32,150
...I never thought I'd call him a junkie.
- I don't think he's getting high.

174
00:15:32,328 --> 00:15:36,094
Come on, Clark. You of all people should
know that everyone has their secrets.

175
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:40,930
It's not a stretch to think that a jet-setting
billionaire might have a habit to hide.

176
00:15:41,104 --> 00:15:43,629
Can you just get it checked out?
We'll know for sure.

177
00:15:43,806 --> 00:15:46,366
I'll text my bio-chem buddy at Met U.

178
00:15:46,543 --> 00:15:48,670
Hopefully he hasn't left for Thanksgiving.

179
00:15:48,845 --> 00:15:51,780
That Green Arrow story.
That victim actually see him get shot?

180
00:15:51,948 --> 00:15:55,349
No, but the people that owned the car
did come forward...

181
00:15:55,518 --> 00:15:57,679
...and say that he saved them that night.

182
00:15:57,854 --> 00:16:00,118
He hasn't been spotted since.

183
00:16:01,424 --> 00:16:04,951
- I'm gonna get this syringe to my chemist.
- Great.

184
00:16:05,128 --> 00:16:08,825
Why don't you head out, and I will get
a hold of you as soon as I find anything.

185
00:16:08,998 --> 00:16:12,695
- Are you trying to get rid of me?
- No, why would I wanna do that?

186
00:16:18,641 --> 00:16:21,371
- Lana.
- Hi.

187
00:16:23,246 --> 00:16:25,737
Us girls were just gonna get some lunch.

188
00:16:25,915 --> 00:16:29,282
That's great. Have a good time.

189
00:16:34,123 --> 00:16:35,647
Well, that wasn't awkward at all.

190
00:16:35,825 --> 00:16:39,693
I try to keep the heavenly bodies from
colliding, but there's only so much I can do.

191
00:16:39,862 --> 00:16:41,727
I want you to check
something out for me.

192
00:16:41,898 --> 00:16:44,890
Yeah, okay. My Google is your Google.
What do you need?

193
00:16:45,068 --> 00:16:48,265
I'm curious about this halfway house
that LuthorCorp supports.

194
00:16:48,438 --> 00:16:51,999
I offered to get involved,
but Lex won't let me. He says it isn't safe.

195
00:16:52,175 --> 00:16:55,440
Well, most halfway houses
aren't exactly amusement parks, Lana.

196
00:16:55,612 --> 00:16:57,910
I don't think that's it.

197
00:16:58,348 --> 00:17:02,682
Lex swears that he's honest with me,
but lately he's been a little secretive.

198
00:17:05,154 --> 00:17:07,019
I don't know, maybe I'm reading into it.

199
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:10,455
No, I think you're just being cautious,
which is smart.

200
00:17:10,627 --> 00:17:13,152
Don't worry, we'll figure things out.

201
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,925
Are you all right?

202
00:17:17,767 --> 00:17:20,531
Lana. Lana.

203
00:17:21,938 --> 00:17:24,930
- Are you okay?
- What happened?

204
00:17:25,108 --> 00:17:27,633
From where I was sitting,
it looked like you fainted.

205
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,778
- Let's get you to a doctor.
- No, it's okay.

206
00:17:30,146 --> 00:17:34,048
Can we keep my little siesta between us?
I really wouldn't want anyone to worry.

207
00:17:35,018 --> 00:17:38,385
Well, it's a little late for that,
but, yeah, okay.

208
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,429
Surprise.

209
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:48,917
- I didn't...
- Get away from me.

210
00:18:49,092 --> 00:18:51,583
I swear to God,
I'll rip your green head off.

211
00:18:52,528 --> 00:18:54,257
I'm calling the cops.

212
00:18:54,731 --> 00:18:57,393
See? 911.

213
00:19:12,615 --> 00:19:15,413
- Hello?
- <i>911.</i>

214
00:19:15,585 --> 00:19:17,314
I need an ambulance.

215
00:19:17,954 --> 00:19:19,319
Hurry.

216
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,912
Have you ever fainted before?

217
00:19:25,346 --> 00:19:27,904
Three times. All in the last month.

218
00:19:29,382 --> 00:19:31,145
These headaches you've been having...

219
00:19:31,317 --> 00:19:33,581
...would you describe the pain
as sharp, or dull?

220
00:19:33,753 --> 00:19:35,277
Sharp, like a knife.

221
00:19:36,489 --> 00:19:38,548
And it's getting worse.

222
00:19:38,724 --> 00:19:42,956
I've tried all of the over-the-counter
pain relievers, but none of them work.

223
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,627
They're just migraines, right?

224
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,233
Just a few more tests,
we'll have a clearer picture.

225
00:20:02,548 --> 00:20:06,416
Martha, I'm so glad you came here.

226
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:08,944
Haven't been able to stop thinking...

227
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:11,449
...about what happened.

228
00:20:12,492 --> 00:20:14,323
I wanted to apologize for...

229
00:20:14,494 --> 00:20:16,689
I didn't come here for an apology, Lionel.

230
00:20:16,863 --> 00:20:18,296
- You did nothing wrong.
- I did.

231
00:20:19,031 --> 00:20:23,024
- I had no right to presume that I could...
- No, look...

232
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,336
...there's something between us.

233
00:20:28,374 --> 00:20:30,899
What it is, I don't think
either of us knows...

234
00:20:31,077 --> 00:20:35,207
...but I do know
I'm not ready to find out.

235
00:20:35,381 --> 00:20:36,973
Not yet.

236
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:42,113
- I understand.
- I don't think you do understand.

237
00:20:44,157 --> 00:20:46,955
I value our relationship.

238
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,325
I really want you to be with me
for Thanksgiving.

239
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,363
Well, then, of course. I will be there.

240
00:21:05,111 --> 00:21:06,237
Lois...

241
00:21:06,412 --> 00:21:08,573
...what happened?
- Well...

242
00:21:08,748 --> 00:21:10,909
...lucky for me,
I walked in on Green Arrow...

243
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,745
...pulling a reverse Santa Claus
on oliver's apartment.

244
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,217
The Green Arrow did this?

245
00:21:15,388 --> 00:21:19,654
Guess it was only a matter of time
before he hit up the new billionaire in town.

246
00:21:19,825 --> 00:21:23,056
Luckily, I was able to get in
a few solid licks of my own.

247
00:21:23,229 --> 00:21:25,390
He'll be nursing
a couple broken ribs for sure.

248
00:21:25,565 --> 00:21:29,433
Have you talked to oliver yet?
Has he visited you here in the hospital?

249
00:21:30,469 --> 00:21:31,868
No.

250
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:35,599
I tried him on all his numbers,
and he was nowhere to be found.

251
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,807
Clark, I'm nervous.

252
00:21:39,979 --> 00:21:43,676
Either he's on some kind of crazy drug
bender, or Green Arrow has gotten to him.

253
00:21:43,849 --> 00:21:45,214
Lois, don't worry.

254
00:21:45,384 --> 00:21:48,114
I promise I'll do everything I can
to track him down.

255
00:21:48,287 --> 00:21:50,721
Yeah, that'll be a big help.

256
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:53,324
Look, I'll just call Chloe.

257
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:08,106
I'll take that.

258
00:22:08,274 --> 00:22:11,675
- I put a bullet in your chest.
- And now you're gonna pay for it.

259
00:22:15,014 --> 00:22:16,948
I don't think so.

260
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:35,666
Hey, buddy.

261
00:22:39,105 --> 00:22:41,835
- How did you survive that fall?
- Yoga. Now let go of me.

262
00:22:42,008 --> 00:22:44,101
You tell me how, or I'm calling the cops.

263
00:22:44,277 --> 00:22:45,642
You'll call the cops anyway.

264
00:22:45,811 --> 00:22:49,577
You may be able to heal,
but that doesn't mean you don't feel pain.

265
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,176
- Let go.
- You start talking.

266
00:22:53,352 --> 00:22:55,843
There's this doctor
who comes to the halfway house.

267
00:22:56,022 --> 00:23:00,584
We get these shots they say are vitamins.
That's some kind of vitamin, huh?

268
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,954
What's the doctor's name?

269
00:23:02,128 --> 00:23:04,790
- How am I supposed to know?
- What does he look like?

270
00:23:05,731 --> 00:23:08,165
It's not a he. She's a chick.

271
00:23:22,214 --> 00:23:24,478
Waste not, want not.

272
00:23:25,017 --> 00:23:26,882
What happened, doctor, bad batch?

273
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,045
The project's shut down.

274
00:23:30,756 --> 00:23:33,384
Look, I might have come into this game
a little late...

275
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:35,754
...but I'm paying you a lot more
than Queen.

276
00:23:35,928 --> 00:23:39,728
- He isn't shutting down anything.
- You're right. I am.

277
00:23:39,899 --> 00:23:42,527
And I could care less
about your petty rivalry.

278
00:23:43,836 --> 00:23:46,464
This has gone beyond
one-upmanship, doctor.

279
00:23:46,639 --> 00:23:49,005
Your research is now
a personal cause of mine.

280
00:23:49,175 --> 00:23:52,667
Find another cause. I won't
be responsible for any more violence.

281
00:23:52,845 --> 00:23:55,370
Should have thought about that
when you took my money.

282
00:23:55,548 --> 00:23:58,210
I admit, I was blinded by greed...

283
00:23:58,384 --> 00:24:02,047
...but now that people are getting hurt,
money means nothing to me.

284
00:24:02,221 --> 00:24:06,749
I'm going back to the drawing board.
All existing RL65 is being destroyed.

285
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,755
I'm sorry, doctor, I can't let you do that.

286
00:24:20,406 --> 00:24:21,873
Hey, how's Lois?

287
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:24,305
Physically, she's fine.
She's looking for oliver.

288
00:24:24,477 --> 00:24:26,775
- I can't find him anywhere.
- Maybe this will help.

289
00:24:27,947 --> 00:24:31,007
My geek analyzed the liquid
in that syringe, and you're right.

290
00:24:31,183 --> 00:24:33,048
No one's gonna take it and go to a rave.

291
00:24:33,219 --> 00:24:35,551
It's a cutting edge molecular modifier...

292
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:37,916
...that has to do
with tissue regeneration.

293
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:40,058
So it has some sort of healing power.

294
00:24:40,226 --> 00:24:43,559
Conceivably, but according to my Einstein,
it also packs a mean punch...

295
00:24:43,729 --> 00:24:47,995
...to a part of your brain, the amygdala,
which triggers violent behavior.

296
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:51,762
Now, why in God's name would oliver
be injecting something like that?

297
00:24:51,937 --> 00:24:55,930
I don't know, but we better find him
before he does something he regrets.

298
00:24:56,108 --> 00:24:57,234
Who created the drug?

299
00:25:02,014 --> 00:25:05,882
A woman named Pamela Black
is the only one doing that level of research.

300
00:25:06,051 --> 00:25:09,452
She's a professor at Princeton,
and has been taking a recent sabbatical...

301
00:25:09,622 --> 00:25:11,453
...to work with Queen Industries.

302
00:25:12,191 --> 00:25:15,718
If she's supplying drugs, then most likely
oliver's gonna show up for more.

303
00:25:43,088 --> 00:25:44,578
She's dead.

304
00:25:44,757 --> 00:25:47,783
And her place
has been completely pillaged.

305
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,259
Drugs or no drugs,
I can't believe oliver would kill someone.

306
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:53,091
I don't think it was oliver, Clark.

307
00:25:53,899 --> 00:25:55,526
It was the Green Arrow.

308
00:25:57,136 --> 00:26:02,005
Looks like our green hero has made the leap
from Robin Hood to cold-blooded killer.

309
00:26:02,174 --> 00:26:05,143
I just don't understand
why a scientist was his target.

310
00:26:05,311 --> 00:26:08,178
- Chloe.
- Clark!

311
00:26:13,986 --> 00:26:15,886
These folders are from a halfway house...

312
00:26:16,055 --> 00:26:18,649
...in Metropolis called Second Chance.
This doctor...

313
00:26:18,824 --> 00:26:21,987
...she was giving the kids
the same drugs oliver was taking.

314
00:26:22,962 --> 00:26:25,658
Lex's foundation
funds this halfway house.

315
00:26:26,699 --> 00:26:29,133
Lex co-opted oliver's scientist.

316
00:26:29,301 --> 00:26:31,701
Those two have been at each other
since high school.

317
00:26:31,871 --> 00:26:35,830
And the Green Arrow got in the way.
Ever the crusader for the underprivileged...

318
00:26:36,008 --> 00:26:38,568
...he must've gotten wind
of Dr. Black's experiments...

319
00:26:38,744 --> 00:26:40,473
...and taken care of her his own way.

320
00:26:40,646 --> 00:26:43,479
If the Green Arrow found out
that LuthorCorp is behind this...

321
00:26:43,649 --> 00:26:45,640
...Lex could be the next target.

322
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:08,431
Sorry.

323
00:27:09,942 --> 00:27:11,671
I'm looking for Lex.

324
00:27:15,447 --> 00:27:17,278
He's not here.

325
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,715
You okay?

326
00:27:27,259 --> 00:27:29,090
Lana, what is it?

327
00:27:30,996 --> 00:27:33,260
It's nothing. I'm fine.

328
00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:39,364
You don't look fine.

329
00:27:42,975 --> 00:27:45,705
You can talk to me, it's okay.

330
00:27:47,379 --> 00:27:48,903
It is.

331
00:27:51,617 --> 00:27:55,417
Do you ever wish
that you could go back in time...

332
00:27:56,255 --> 00:27:58,655
...and everything would be different?

333
00:28:03,996 --> 00:28:05,896
All the time.

334
00:28:13,572 --> 00:28:15,870
What happened? What did...

335
00:28:21,146 --> 00:28:24,081
- What did Lex do?
- He didn't do anything.

336
00:28:26,619 --> 00:28:28,416
If you're in trouble, Lana, I can help.

337
00:28:28,587 --> 00:28:31,454
Clark, this has nothing to do with you.

338
00:28:32,224 --> 00:28:34,852
Could you please just go?

339
00:29:05,824 --> 00:29:07,883
Your car is ready, sir.

340
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,365
Sorry, Luthor.

341
00:29:20,773 --> 00:29:22,365
Work's not over yet.

342
00:29:25,811 --> 00:29:27,711
- What is this?
- Sign on the dotted line...

343
00:29:28,047 --> 00:29:31,813
...and all your assets will be divided
among the 50 global charities listed below.

344
00:29:31,984 --> 00:29:34,953
Would you mind telling me
what I've done to deserve this?

345
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,782
After your support of the
Second Chance Halfway House...

346
00:29:37,956 --> 00:29:42,154
...I think it's a natural step.
I went by to check out the facility.

347
00:29:42,327 --> 00:29:46,229
After some prodding, the director told me
what you were doing to the residents.

348
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:47,592
He was lying.

349
00:29:47,766 --> 00:29:50,997
So then I went to pay
the good doctor a visit, and guess what?

350
00:29:51,503 --> 00:29:53,164
She's dead.

351
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:59,001
I knew you weren't a saint, Luthor,
but killing a woman to cover your tracks?

352
00:29:59,645 --> 00:30:01,044
You're delusional.

353
00:30:02,614 --> 00:30:04,479
Sign it.

354
00:30:12,825 --> 00:30:14,224
What the hell are you doing?

355
00:30:15,861 --> 00:30:17,556
It's out of ink.

356
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:18,924
Drop it.

357
00:30:23,435 --> 00:30:26,029
- You first.
- What do you think is faster?

358
00:30:26,205 --> 00:30:28,765
An arrow, or a bullet?

359
00:30:30,776 --> 00:30:32,607
There's only one way to find out.

360
00:31:00,305 --> 00:31:01,897
Oliver.

361
00:31:06,111 --> 00:31:07,908
What have you done?

362
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,947
He pulled a gun, Clark. I had no choice.

363
00:31:11,116 --> 00:31:14,085
Lex? Lex?

364
00:31:14,253 --> 00:31:16,153
No, let nature take its course.

365
00:31:18,157 --> 00:31:21,524
Oliver, that's the drugs talking.
It's not you.

366
00:31:21,693 --> 00:31:25,151
Hey, that drug is the best thing
that ever happened to me, Clark.

367
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:28,788
I'm not bulletproof like you are.
I gotta do whatever it takes.

368
00:31:28,967 --> 00:31:31,936
- I need that drug.
- Oliver, you're not a killer.

369
00:31:32,104 --> 00:31:33,503
No, but he is, Clark.

370
00:31:33,672 --> 00:31:37,438
Listen to me, you and I both know the
world's a better place without Lex Luthor.

371
00:31:40,712 --> 00:31:45,206
That's not for us to decide, oliver.
Where are the drugs?

372
00:31:45,384 --> 00:31:48,148
Lex, he took it all.
He took it all from the lab.

373
00:32:04,436 --> 00:32:06,199
Let him die.

374
00:32:23,856 --> 00:32:25,483
You killed him.

375
00:32:28,894 --> 00:32:30,327
You killed him.

376
00:33:37,538 --> 00:33:39,597
Who am I dealing with? Jekyll or Hyde?

377
00:33:41,642 --> 00:33:43,542
Just plain old oliver today, Clark.

378
00:33:44,678 --> 00:33:47,613
You haven't broken any glasses.
That's a good sign.

379
00:33:47,782 --> 00:33:49,147
Right.

380
00:33:49,984 --> 00:33:51,576
What made you come to your senses?

381
00:33:54,088 --> 00:33:55,851
Actually, you did.

382
00:33:57,691 --> 00:34:01,650
This whole time, I just wanted to be
like Clark Kent, you know. I wanted to...

383
00:34:03,197 --> 00:34:05,597
I wanted the ability
to bring justice to the world...

384
00:34:05,766 --> 00:34:08,667
...without having to worry
about getting killed in the process.

385
00:34:11,605 --> 00:34:14,574
And then something occurred to me,
and I realized...

386
00:34:15,142 --> 00:34:17,702
...that Clark Kent would never take
another man's life.

387
00:34:19,647 --> 00:34:22,081
I came within an inch of doing just that.

388
00:34:26,954 --> 00:34:28,751
I'm not even in your league.

389
00:34:30,024 --> 00:34:33,482
Oliver, you do a lot of good in this world.

390
00:34:34,895 --> 00:34:37,329
You don't need to be indestructible
to be a hero.

391
00:34:37,898 --> 00:34:40,924
Yeah. No, you're right, you're right.
Yeah...

392
00:34:41,102 --> 00:34:45,232
I should be thankful for who I am, right?
And the abilities that I have. I know that.

393
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:48,565
Me too.

394
00:34:52,513 --> 00:34:55,004
Now, come on,
you can't be alone on Thanksgiving.

395
00:34:55,182 --> 00:34:56,672
The bird's waiting.

396
00:34:56,851 --> 00:35:00,548
Thanks, Clark, l...
No, I appreciate the offer, but I can't.

397
00:35:01,722 --> 00:35:02,882
Lois is gonna be there...

398
00:35:03,057 --> 00:35:06,424
...and I'm pretty sure she doesn't
want to be in the same zip code as me.

399
00:35:06,594 --> 00:35:11,827
Now that you're back on track,
I'm sure Lois is gonna want you there.

400
00:35:11,999 --> 00:35:13,967
- Trust me.
- Whoa, trust you?

401
00:35:15,269 --> 00:35:18,102
What happened to lectures
about guys with secret identities...

402
00:35:18,272 --> 00:35:19,933
...not able to handle relationships?

403
00:35:22,143 --> 00:35:27,206
The truth is, you and I are different,
and Lois isn't Lana.

404
00:35:28,315 --> 00:35:31,682
If you two are meant to be together,
then who am I to stand in the way?

405
00:35:49,203 --> 00:35:51,933
Hey. Are you feeling any better?

406
00:35:52,106 --> 00:35:54,165
Hanging in there.

407
00:35:54,642 --> 00:35:57,289
Well, make yourself comfortable.
I did my due diligence...

408
00:35:57,409 --> 00:36:00,045
...on the Second Chances
Halfway House, and I found...

409
00:36:00,214 --> 00:36:04,344
Chloe, I'm not here to talk about
the halfway house.

410
00:36:06,587 --> 00:36:08,487
Okay.

411
00:36:08,656 --> 00:36:12,023
But there's some stuff I think you
should know about Lana. About Lex.

412
00:36:12,193 --> 00:36:16,391
I don't want to hear anything more
about Lex. I can't.

413
00:36:18,832 --> 00:36:20,527
What's going on?

414
00:36:20,701 --> 00:36:22,259
Lana, what happened?

415
00:36:23,804 --> 00:36:27,331
Hey, you know you can tell me anything.

416
00:36:32,313 --> 00:36:33,940
Chloe...

417
00:36:35,849 --> 00:36:37,282
...l'm pregnant.

418
00:36:45,526 --> 00:36:47,084
Okay.

419
00:37:02,532 --> 00:37:04,159
There.

420
00:37:04,334 --> 00:37:06,393
Did you cook that on the barbecue?

421
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:10,267
It's a little crispy on the outside,
but it's what's on the inside that counts.

422
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,839
I'm sure it's delicious.

423
00:37:12,008 --> 00:37:14,772
Clark, would you put the hot plate
on the table, please?

424
00:37:15,245 --> 00:37:17,270
Did you talk to oliver today?

425
00:37:18,148 --> 00:37:19,945
Don't go there, Smallville.

426
00:37:24,354 --> 00:37:26,219
I think that's for you.

427
00:37:31,695 --> 00:37:35,563
Jimmy says hi from his mom's house
and, ever the reporter, he has news.

428
00:37:35,732 --> 00:37:37,791
I guess the Metropolis P.D. Arrested...

429
00:37:37,968 --> 00:37:40,300
...Pamela Black's killer,
and you were right.

430
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:44,497
It wasn't the Green Arrow.
It was some kid from the halfway house.

431
00:37:44,674 --> 00:37:47,370
I'd bet anything
that Lex is somehow behind this.

432
00:37:47,544 --> 00:37:50,172
Maybe. I doubt
we'll be able to prove it, though.

433
00:37:50,347 --> 00:37:53,578
I guarantee you Lex's shredders
are doing some serious overtime.

434
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,445
Does Lana know about this?

435
00:37:56,319 --> 00:37:59,584
I went by the mansion the other day,
and she was upset about something.

436
00:37:59,756 --> 00:38:01,383
Is she all right?

437
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:05,824
Yeah. Yeah, as far as I know.

438
00:38:06,563 --> 00:38:08,190
She's fine.

439
00:38:15,539 --> 00:38:16,733
Oliver.

440
00:38:18,608 --> 00:38:20,098
Happy turkey day.

441
00:38:26,149 --> 00:38:28,845
Where you been?
I've been worried about you.

442
00:38:29,019 --> 00:38:30,850
Yeah.

443
00:38:31,888 --> 00:38:34,015
Listen, that's all over now.

444
00:38:36,126 --> 00:38:39,425
I'm like a walking drug-free zone. Honest.

445
00:38:40,697 --> 00:38:44,258
If I were to hug you right now, I wouldn't
stab myself on any stray needles?

446
00:38:46,336 --> 00:38:47,963
Get over here.

447
00:38:52,275 --> 00:38:54,800
I'm so sorry I ever hurt you.

448
00:39:13,763 --> 00:39:17,028
If I could have
everyone's attention, please?

449
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,361
I'd like to make a little announcement.

450
00:39:21,938 --> 00:39:24,236
Our family has a tradition...

451
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:28,902
...that goes back
way before I was even born...

452
00:39:29,746 --> 00:39:34,240
...where everyone takes a moment to say
what they're most thankful for in their lives.

453
00:39:40,423 --> 00:39:45,224
I would just like to say that
I'm most thankful for my mom and dad...

454
00:39:51,201 --> 00:39:54,534
...whose faith in me
taught me to have faith in myself.

455
00:39:55,672 --> 00:39:57,162
Thank you.

456
00:40:04,915 --> 00:40:07,315
- Hear, hear.
- Let's eat.

457
00:41:13,483 --> 00:41:15,713
You haven't said a word all night.

458
00:41:17,053 --> 00:41:18,748
Is everything okay?

459
00:41:19,889 --> 00:41:21,754
Everything's fine.

460
00:41:28,098 --> 00:41:29,588
Happy Thanksgiving.
