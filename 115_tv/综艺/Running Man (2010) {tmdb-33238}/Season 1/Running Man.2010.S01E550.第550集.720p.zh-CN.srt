00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My mom's bipolar.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Like... Like in-and-out-of-hospitals bipolar.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And,uh,sometimes I get afraid that i'll turn out like her,too.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm not telling you to be sorry.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm just telling you 'cause

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
everyone has stuff that no one can see.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
If you're in high school,

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I think the most normal thing you can feel is not normal.
