1
00:00:01,809 --> 00:00:03,396
US Marshal, stop!

2
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:11,263
What is this guy on?

3
00:00:21,926 --> 00:00:24,503
US Marshals, everyone just stay
where they are!

4
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,174
Put your hands up,

5
00:00:29,942 --> 00:00:31,512
and slowly turn around.

6
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:39,635
Turn around. I said
turn around.

7
00:00:45,134 --> 00:00:46,192
Jimmy?

8
00:00:50,421 --> 00:00:51,428
Ben?

9
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,624
This is a dream.

10
00:01:08,136 --> 00:01:11,515
You at the altar, I'm gonna
say it again, turn around.

11
00:01:21,978 --> 00:01:23,189
You ok?

12
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,176
Yeah, how long was I out?

13
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,462
About 15 minutes.

14
00:01:30,121 --> 00:01:31,537
Been sleeping like crap.

15
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,950
- I got an hour last night.
- You were talking to yourself.

16
00:01:37,448 --> 00:01:38,506
- Was I?
- Yeah.

17
00:01:38,949 --> 00:01:40,707
You said Jimmy and Ben.

18
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:43,506
- No I did not...
- Yeah, you did.

19
00:01:45,176 --> 00:01:47,429
- Any sign of Harcourt?
- No.

20
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,251
- The guy is wanted for assault charges.
- Not really known for the punctuality.

21
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,687
- I mean, are we sure about this tip?
- My DEA buddy said that Harcourt's

22
00:01:54,807 --> 00:01:57,708
been running pot out of this place,
he's been here the last three saturdays.

23
00:01:57,998 --> 00:01:59,482
<i>We got a car coming up the alley.</i>

24
00:01:59,602 --> 00:02:02,106
<i>It's a silver Saturn
Texas plates.</i>

25
00:02:02,977 --> 00:02:05,485
<i>It's X-4-S
T-T-3.</i>

26
00:02:07,635 --> 00:02:09,444
It's registered to Harcourt's father.

27
00:02:10,827 --> 00:02:13,113
- It's Harcourt behind the wheel.
- Yup.

28
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:15,568
Looks like he's got
a friend with him.

29
00:02:16,728 --> 00:02:17,769
We go in?

30
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:19,851
Subdue the front
take Harcourt down.

31
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:25,736
US Marshals
US Marshals, down on the ground!

32
00:02:25,856 --> 00:02:28,091
- We got a runner out the back!
- I got him!

33
00:02:28,211 --> 00:02:30,563
- ***
- Backyard!

34
00:02:37,406 --> 00:02:38,993
What are you running for?

35
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,477
You really don't want
to do that Harcourt.

36
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,442
Now doesn't that hurt?

37
00:03:03,741 --> 00:03:06,915
- Should we get him down?
- Yeah, at some point.

38
00:03:14,177 --> 00:03:16,651
Get in the car Harcourt
watch your head.

39
00:03:16,771 --> 00:03:18,631
Marco what you got?

40
00:03:18,751 --> 00:03:21,753
Name is Jackie Walsh,
favourite color is blue, likes

41
00:03:21,873 --> 00:03:25,235
pizza, dancing, and long walks
on the beach, ain't that right Jack?

42
00:03:26,784 --> 00:03:28,354
Any idea why he ran?

43
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:30,453
Luke is running his ID.
We're just sitting tight.

44
00:03:30,573 --> 00:03:32,756
Hey man you gotta believe me man,
I wasn't the shooter.

45
00:03:33,968 --> 00:03:36,255
- What did you say Jackie?
- I wasn't the shooter.

46
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,470
- Come here.
- You ready for this?

47
00:03:38,948 --> 00:03:41,764
Jackie Walsh, we got an open
warrant for him as well.

48
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:44,784
He's on of the four guys wanted
for killing that cop a month ago.

49
00:03:45,535 --> 00:03:47,122
- The Ellen Lacey murder?
- Yeah.

50
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:52,016
So not only do we clear our
assault and battery

51
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:54,541
we get a good lead on
four copkillers.

52
00:03:57,016 --> 00:03:58,415
It's not even lunch.

53
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,060
Chase 2x17

54
00:04:09,538 --> 00:04:11,057
Look man, I didn't
kill that cop.

55
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:12,981
John Makin.

56
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,916
Steven "Little Boy" Washington,
and Francis Washington.

57
00:04:16,036 --> 00:04:17,111
Where are they?

58
00:04:19,022 --> 00:04:20,661
You know what,
it's not that cop.

59
00:04:21,377 --> 00:04:22,759
Her name is Ellen Lacey.

60
00:04:23,217 --> 00:04:24,753
She's 32 years old.

61
00:04:26,477 --> 00:04:28,729
She's a wife... mother.

62
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:31,187
Nothin' bad was
supposed to happen.

63
00:04:32,387 --> 00:04:34,776
We was just headin' out to collect
for some idiot crackhead.

64
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,377
And after we ***
you know we goin' out right?

65
00:04:38,701 --> 00:04:40,920
Just like we used to do
back in the old days.

66
00:04:42,564 --> 00:04:45,260
Show some Houston ladies
how the New Orleans boys play.

67
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:49,612
Why so quiet little boy?

68
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,819
You miss your prison
boyfriends?

69
00:04:55,915 --> 00:04:57,604
What the hell
did you do Francis?

70
00:04:57,724 --> 00:04:59,999
- Nothing.
- I can't be here man, I jumped bail.

71
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,552
Calm down Makin.

72
00:05:01,672 --> 00:05:03,890
Don't tell me to calm down,
I'm facing 6 months.

73
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,579
You don't got no
weapons on you right?

74
00:05:06,968 --> 00:05:10,176
It's cool,
everything's gonna be good.

75
00:05:16,326 --> 00:05:17,913
( Indistinct radio )

76
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,898
( Dog barking )

77
00:05:30,086 --> 00:05:31,622
License and proof of
insurance please.

78
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,408
Was I speeding officer?

79
00:05:35,517 --> 00:05:36,712
You tell me, were you?

80
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:38,162
I don't think so.

81
00:05:39,408 --> 00:05:41,319
It's cause you weren't,
but your tail lights are both out.

82
00:05:42,528 --> 00:05:44,371
Can I get an ID on
everyone please?

83
00:05:53,842 --> 00:05:56,450
- Makin!
- Stop! Get down on the ground!

84
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,610
Stop!

85
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:05,407
- What the hell you doing there boy?
- One of us runs, we all get hauled in.

86
00:06:05,527 --> 00:06:08,359
He faces 6 months, I'm facing life
for being here with you.

87
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,226
- Now get in the car.
- Everybody get in the damned car.

88
00:06:11,346 --> 00:06:12,660
Makin, get back here.

89
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:28,369
You you gotta believe me man, I ain't never
done nothin' worse than petty theft

90
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:30,093
I'll tell y'all what ever
y'all wanna know.

91
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,390
Annie: Alright.

92
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,086
After the shooting...

93
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:36,584
I got dropped off at my
sister's house.

94
00:06:36,942 --> 00:06:38,802
Makin went to the hotel
to lay low, and

95
00:06:38,922 --> 00:06:40,782
Francis and "Little Boy"
I ain't seen them since.

96
00:06:41,703 --> 00:06:43,017
Do you have any communication
with them?

97
00:06:43,816 --> 00:06:45,966
Yeah, I mean we got cells, but

98
00:06:46,359 --> 00:06:48,236
we only turn them on everyday
at like two o'clock.

99
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:50,488
You know, just for
emergencies only.

100
00:06:50,898 --> 00:06:52,007
It's "Little Boy's" idea.

101
00:06:52,127 --> 00:06:54,243
He said we could talk,
but we can't be traced.

102
00:06:56,381 --> 00:06:57,934
Y'all gonna tell the Judge
how I helped out though yeah?

103
00:06:58,054 --> 00:06:59,060
Oh, yeah.

104
00:06:59,913 --> 00:07:01,210
But you're not done helping us yet.

105
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,861
Gonna need their trigger van.

106
00:07:08,913 --> 00:07:10,773
Two minutes to the call.
Two minutes!

107
00:07:10,893 --> 00:07:11,786
Hey.

108
00:07:11,906 --> 00:07:16,205
<i>Eye on the prize, every 10 seconds gets us a
quarter mile closer to ID their location.</i>

109
00:07:18,663 --> 00:07:19,738
Just so you know

110
00:07:20,181 --> 00:07:21,547
I'm pretty good at dream analysis.

111
00:07:22,406 --> 00:07:23,891
I'm just saying you know

112
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:26,467
Daisy going to jail,
Jimmy getting engaged,

113
00:07:26,587 --> 00:07:27,918
- a lot of changes...
- Mhmm.

114
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:30,870
All I'm saying is, if you need someone to
give you an opinion about

115
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,386
what's eating you...

116
00:07:32,506 --> 00:07:34,638
- You're my guy? Ok.
- I'm your guy.

117
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,591
You know, actually there is a dream
you can help me with.

118
00:07:37,711 --> 00:07:40,338
So I'm sitting in this van right,
in this dream

119
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:41,686
Van...

120
00:07:42,911 --> 00:07:44,123
You're there.

121
00:07:44,617 --> 00:07:45,846
I'm there?

122
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:49,293
And you finally

123
00:07:49,822 --> 00:07:53,867
stop bugging me long enough so that we
can run down four copkillers.

124
00:07:53,987 --> 00:07:55,672
Ok? Yeah.

125
00:07:57,823 --> 00:07:59,120
It's time.

126
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,004
<i>Alright Jimmy
let's go ahead and make the call</i>

127
00:08:02,124 --> 00:08:03,147
Keep it general.

128
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:04,922
I don't want them getting suspicious
do you understand me?

129
00:08:05,042 --> 00:08:06,830
<i>- Mhmm.
- They'll take your call right?</i>

130
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,168
<i>Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, man, these guys
are like brothers to me</i>

131
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:10,721
<i>we grew up together in New Orleans.</i>

132
00:08:11,437 --> 00:08:13,536
Longer you keep them on,
the easier the Judge goes on you.

133
00:08:16,904 --> 00:08:17,894
<i>Hey Jackie.</i>

134
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:19,976
Hey what's up Francis,
what you doin' man?

135
00:08:20,096 --> 00:08:21,580
<i>What you need man?</i>

136
00:08:22,894 --> 00:08:24,379
Hey are you still with "Little Boy?"

137
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:28,496
<i>- They're still in Houston.
- Alright keep him talking Jimmy.</i>

138
00:08:29,111 --> 00:08:30,459
What about John?

139
00:08:31,227 --> 00:08:34,731
They're somewhere north of the city,
close to Coverdale and West Branch.

140
00:08:34,851 --> 00:08:37,683
Alright get on the 610 loop
to the I45 north

141
00:08:37,803 --> 00:08:40,038
I was just thinking that we
should all like meet up.

142
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:41,335
You know, like face to face.

143
00:08:42,018 --> 00:08:43,042
Give me that.

144
00:08:43,414 --> 00:08:44,882
What you calling here for Jackie?

145
00:08:48,858 --> 00:08:49,950
"Little Boy?"

146
00:08:51,605 --> 00:08:54,199
<i>- Look like Acres Homes.
- Who are you with? Where were are you at?</i>

147
00:08:54,503 --> 00:08:55,817
<i>Who are you with Jackie?</i>

148
00:08:58,974 --> 00:09:01,397
- What happened? Did he hang up?
- By the sound of it, I think he shot it.

149
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,565
Woah, woah man, calm down.

150
00:09:03,685 --> 00:09:06,056
I go out here to sell a little smack,
and you ***

151
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:09,611
How long where you
on the phone for man?

152
00:09:09,731 --> 00:09:11,949
- I don't know, a few minutes?
- Come on France.

153
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:14,082
Man that's long enough
for them to trace us.

154
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,144
You think Jackie flipped?

155
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:18,072
Yeah man...

156
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,222
he's a weak son of a bitch.

157
00:09:21,331 --> 00:09:23,260
What should we do man?
Pack up, go get Makin?

158
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,887
Get the hell out of Houston.

159
00:09:35,003 --> 00:09:36,624
I still get credit for helping right?

160
00:09:36,728 --> 00:09:38,696
ANNIE: Get him out of here.
LUKE: My pleasure.

161
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:45,452
Uh, Natalie. Hey!
Hey. Hi.

162
00:09:45,537 --> 00:09:46,737
You looking for Jimmy?

163
00:09:46,805 --> 00:09:48,372
Jimmy. Yeah.

164
00:09:48,423 --> 00:09:49,740
Wedding planning.

165
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:52,977
Hmm? Oh, right.

166
00:09:53,044 --> 00:09:54,245
Uh, chocolate or French Silk?

167
00:09:54,312 --> 00:09:57,181
String quartet or jazz?

168
00:09:57,248 --> 00:09:58,682
You know how it is. It's...

169
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,935
(awkward laugh):
Yeah...

170
00:10:02,087 --> 00:10:03,888
Well, I... yeah.
Guess you can't ever

171
00:10:03,939 --> 00:10:06,140
go wrong
with plain old chocolate.

172
00:10:06,224 --> 00:10:07,992
That's always good, right?
MAN: Jackie Walsh!

173
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:10,261
You son of a...!
(groans)

174
00:10:10,328 --> 00:10:12,313
LUKE: Hey!
ANNIE: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

175
00:10:12,397 --> 00:10:13,948
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. Sit down.

176
00:10:14,032 --> 00:10:15,532
Calm down.
Sit. Sit!

177
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,619
Sit down. LUKE: Relax.

178
00:10:18,703 --> 00:10:20,604
What's going on?

179
00:10:20,655 --> 00:10:21,906
ANNIE:
Who is this?

180
00:10:21,957 --> 00:10:24,658
He... he killed my wife.

181
00:10:29,113 --> 00:10:32,483
They left Ellen in the road
to die. (Sobbing)

182
00:10:34,586 --> 00:10:36,921
At least I didn't shoot him,
right?

183
00:10:41,192 --> 00:10:43,761
You work HPD, like Ellen did,
right?

184
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:48,966
When it first happened...

185
00:10:49,034 --> 00:10:52,736
the entire force is looking
for these guys.

186
00:10:52,804 --> 00:10:56,106
But the department's only
got so many resources.

187
00:10:56,174 --> 00:10:57,875
You know how it goes.

188
00:10:57,943 --> 00:11:00,544
Now we're on it, too.

189
00:11:00,612 --> 00:11:03,981
I've been keeping track
of the search.

190
00:11:04,049 --> 00:11:05,482
Don't know if there's
anything there

191
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,484
that might help you.

192
00:11:12,824 --> 00:11:14,992
(Jimmy and Natalie murmuring)

193
00:11:21,099 --> 00:11:22,716
No, we've...

194
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,371
We've got most of this.

195
00:11:33,011 --> 00:11:34,244
So what...

196
00:11:34,312 --> 00:11:36,680
what is that number?
Guy I hired to help me.

197
00:11:40,235 --> 00:11:42,036
I'm going to add this.

198
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,788
This I'll have to...
follow up on.

199
00:11:44,856 --> 00:11:46,189
(knocking on door)

200
00:11:46,241 --> 00:11:47,190
(door opens)

201
00:11:52,163 --> 00:11:53,564
I was wondering when you'd show.

202
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:57,401
Mm. I've been busy.

203
00:11:57,469 --> 00:11:58,886
Been meaning to call you.

204
00:11:58,970 --> 00:11:59,903
Can I come in?

205
00:11:59,971 --> 00:12:01,538
Not without a warrant.

206
00:12:01,606 --> 00:12:02,573
(softly):
Ah...

207
00:12:07,262 --> 00:12:09,430
So...

208
00:12:09,514 --> 00:12:12,149
you've been working
the Ellen Lacy killing.

209
00:12:12,216 --> 00:12:13,934
Always business with you.

210
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:15,719
Come on, Ben.

211
00:12:15,787 --> 00:12:18,922
The husband hired me
on a private contract.

212
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,858
So tell me what I don't know.

213
00:12:20,925 --> 00:12:22,059
Anything not in that file.

214
00:12:22,127 --> 00:12:23,494
Look, Annie.

215
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:24,828
You know I like you
and everything,

216
00:12:24,896 --> 00:12:26,430
but that's money
out of my pocket.

217
00:12:26,498 --> 00:12:27,831
Ben, they killed a cop.

218
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:30,401
I want these guys bad,
especially the shooter.

219
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:36,940
(sighing):
Ah, the shooter, Little Boy.

220
00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:38,942
Mm-hmm?
He's a nasty piece of work.

221
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,712
Talked to a couple of guys that knew him
at the Darrington Correctional Facility.

222
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,747
Yeah, he had a rough time?
One way

223
00:12:43,815 --> 00:12:45,749
to put it. His
cellmate hung himself,

224
00:12:45,817 --> 00:12:47,484
but, word was,
Little Boy strung him up.

225
00:12:47,552 --> 00:12:49,620
You know why?

226
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:52,256
I'm not in the "why" business.
I'm in the "where" business.

227
00:12:52,323 --> 00:12:54,858
And Little Boy's gone
like Christmas.

228
00:12:54,926 --> 00:12:56,593
Yeah, he is.

229
00:12:56,661 --> 00:12:59,696
I mean, do you know anything about
Little Boy's brother Francis?

230
00:12:59,764 --> 00:13:01,131
John Macon?

231
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:02,666
No. I had one lead.

232
00:13:02,734 --> 00:13:05,436
Macon's sister worked at a rug
factory down in North Houston.

233
00:13:05,503 --> 00:13:06,770
You think he was staying there?

234
00:13:06,838 --> 00:13:08,772
He was, up until two weeks ago.

235
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,107
I almost had him there.

236
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:13,143
Thanks for the tip.

237
00:13:13,211 --> 00:13:14,745
No, hey.

238
00:13:14,813 --> 00:13:16,280
I mean, really...

239
00:13:17,499 --> 00:13:18,715
You're telling me that

240
00:13:18,783 --> 00:13:21,652
that is the only reason
that you came here?

241
00:13:31,462 --> 00:13:33,397
You should take off your badge.

242
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:35,365
Stay awhile.

243
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:45,875
(brakes screech)

244
00:13:47,277 --> 00:13:49,679
Don Macon's sister...
This is her workplace.

245
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,982
Houston PD tracked a LoJack.
This blue Honda...stolen by

246
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,767
a man fitting
Macon's description.

247
00:13:54,852 --> 00:13:58,020
We got a security guard who says
he's in there alone. (Guns cocking)

248
00:13:58,088 --> 00:13:59,522
Let's do this.

249
00:14:09,566 --> 00:14:12,535
Oh! Oh, hell.

250
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,161
Turn around
so I can see your face.

251
00:14:35,225 --> 00:14:36,292
I'm right here.

252
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:03,252
Hey.

253
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:07,323
Good dream?

254
00:15:08,425 --> 00:15:10,793
Yeah.

255
00:15:15,098 --> 00:15:16,832
(grunts) (sighs)

256
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:18,351
Someone's in a hurry.

257
00:15:18,435 --> 00:15:21,003
Ben... whew!

258
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,140
Um...

259
00:15:24,207 --> 00:15:27,610
this thing between you and I...
Oh...

260
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:30,212
This doesn't sound good.
(sighs)

261
00:15:32,316 --> 00:15:33,849
I shouldn't have stayed
last night.

262
00:15:34,952 --> 00:15:37,787
Okay. What is it?

263
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:40,289
Is it another guy?

264
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:42,708
That why?

265
00:15:42,793 --> 00:15:44,760
Thought you weren't
in the "why" business.

266
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,396
Coffee?

267
00:15:47,464 --> 00:15:49,465
Work.

268
00:16:10,687 --> 00:16:11,988
(gate slams)

269
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:13,022
Hey, Annie.

270
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:14,357
John Macon's sister here.

271
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:17,326
She admitted that she let him
hide at her work,

272
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:18,661
two days last week.

273
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,946
She says he left
and hasn't contacted her since.

274
00:16:21,031 --> 00:16:22,948
So how'd you get the tip?

275
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:24,450
Uh, Ben Crowley.

276
00:16:24,534 --> 00:16:27,603
Oh, yeah? When was the last time
you saw him?

277
00:16:30,774 --> 00:16:32,808
Weren't you wearing
those clothes yesterday?

278
00:16:32,876 --> 00:16:35,211
Call Darrington, and have him
send me Little Boy's files,

279
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:36,278
and his cellmates'.

280
00:16:36,346 --> 00:16:38,014
Right.

281
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:40,016
Where's the sister?

282
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:43,185
I'll warn you,
she's, uh, colorful.

283
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,104
I already talked to
Eyelashes out there,

284
00:16:45,188 --> 00:16:47,523
I talked to Stretch.

285
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,325
Now I got to talk
to Bitcherella.

286
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:53,362
No, you don't have to talk
to us.

287
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,598
Did you put your house up,
as collateral

288
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:57,767
on your brother's bond?

289
00:16:57,834 --> 00:16:59,168
You see, Johnny jumped bail
so we can

290
00:16:59,236 --> 00:17:00,336
actually seize your house,
now, you understand?

291
00:17:00,404 --> 00:17:02,655
My house?!
Because of what my brother did?

292
00:17:02,739 --> 00:17:04,106
Yeah. You need the name

293
00:17:04,174 --> 00:17:06,642
of a good moving company,
I'm sure we can get you one.

294
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,647
Do I got to stay here?

295
00:17:11,715 --> 00:17:14,133
No. You're free to go.
Come on.

296
00:17:16,219 --> 00:17:17,887
I'm going to tell you something,
as soon as I file

297
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,722
those papers, you'd better
be ready to pack.

298
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,723
You understand that?

299
00:17:24,394 --> 00:17:26,796
She'll be calling her brother
any minute now.

300
00:17:28,899 --> 00:17:32,634
She's already been on her
cell for close to a minute.

301
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:35,771
John! This is really screwing
me over, MACON'S SISTER:

302
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:37,907
With Little Boy,
Look, if you want to go down

303
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:40,076
fine! But don't take my house.
MACON: Okay. Okay, listen.

304
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:41,744
I am handling this, Linda.
LINDA: Clearly...

305
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:44,547
The cell signal's coming from
near Baton Rouge, headed east.

306
00:17:44,614 --> 00:17:46,348
Can we play back the tape? Yeah.

307
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,833
(rewinding tape squeaks)
(train whistle blows)

308
00:17:47,918 --> 00:17:49,452
Do you hear that?
MACON: Okay, okay...

309
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:52,088
(mimics train chugging) There's
a whistle in the background.

310
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:53,856
Yeah, sounds like a train.
Yeah, but a train

311
00:17:53,924 --> 00:17:56,342
with the doors open.
No sound dampening.

312
00:17:56,426 --> 00:17:57,893
Freight train.

313
00:17:59,362 --> 00:18:01,931
You never hopped a rail before?

314
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,432
You have to tell me
that story sometime.

315
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,801
Stories.
Baton Rouge

316
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:08,104
has a train yard. It's one mile
north of the city.

317
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:09,238
Let's call them.

318
00:18:09,306 --> 00:18:10,639
Search every freight train
coming in.

319
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:11,974
You got it.

320
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:15,694
(train horn blowing)

321
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:19,048
LITTLE BOY:
Yo! Where you been Macon?

322
00:18:19,116 --> 00:18:21,734
(train horn toots)

323
00:18:21,818 --> 00:18:23,619
What's the plan, Little Boy?

324
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:27,990
Where are we headed?

325
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:31,577
I got a stash.
Get us out of the country.

326
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,664
Stash, man. What's the stash?

327
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,500
I'm tired of all this...

328
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:40,085
this hush-hush. I'm tired of this train...
! Cool out, John.

329
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:41,370
I told you. The cops
are watching

330
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:42,471
the roads out of Houston.

331
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,423
Why's it always
"Cool out, John"? Huh?

332
00:18:44,508 --> 00:18:47,143
Little Boy's the one what shot
the cop. Not me! Not you!

333
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,379
Why all of us got to suffer,
including my sister,

334
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,397
for what he had done?

335
00:18:51,481 --> 00:18:52,481
"Your sister"?

336
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:54,850
When did you talk
to your sister?

337
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:56,435
Is that what you
were just doing?

338
00:18:58,405 --> 00:18:59,822
She's just family, man,

339
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,158
like-like
Francis and you.

340
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:03,659
I got to look out for her.

341
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,663
How many times I got
to tell you, man?!

342
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,231
No cell phones!

343
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,456
I should throw you off next.

344
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,592
(grunts) (groans)

345
00:19:19,676 --> 00:19:21,427
(blows landing)

346
00:19:23,213 --> 00:19:24,580
(grunting)

347
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:25,931
Little Boy!

348
00:19:26,016 --> 00:19:28,450
FRANCIS:
Hey, get off him, Macon!

349
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,106
(groaning)

350
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:39,261
(sharp groan)

351
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:41,197
(drops knife)

352
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:42,615
(groaning) Grab him, Francis!

353
00:19:42,699 --> 00:19:44,984
(train whistle blowing)

354
00:19:48,805 --> 00:19:51,240
(Little Boy groaning)

355
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,409
What are you looking
at me like that?

356
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,828
He attacked me! You saw him.
You're bleeding.

357
00:19:55,912 --> 00:19:57,997
You need to get off, then
get you to a hospital.

358
00:19:58,081 --> 00:19:59,381
No. No hospitals!

359
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:02,668
Too easy to get caught, man.

360
00:20:02,752 --> 00:20:04,803
Think about it! You know anyone
who could take us in?

361
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:11,427
(train chugging)

362
00:20:11,478 --> 00:20:14,363
OFFICER: Engineer saw one
of the guys jump off.

363
00:20:14,431 --> 00:20:16,932
By the time he got the train
stopped, they were long gone.

364
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:18,800
JIMMY: We heard there's a car
stolen, from the neighborhood

365
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:19,801
where they jumped.
Is that right?

366
00:20:19,853 --> 00:20:21,820
Brown '99 Grand Am.

367
00:20:21,905 --> 00:20:23,405
Taken from a supermarket
parking lot.

368
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:26,275
There's blood in the boxcar?
(indistinct radio transmission)

369
00:20:26,343 --> 00:20:27,826
OFFICER:
See for yourself.

370
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,247
Whoever lost that much blood

371
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:33,032
isn't getting very far
without medical help.

372
00:20:33,116 --> 00:20:34,250
Contact nearby hospitals.

373
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:35,918
Send photos of
all three of them.

374
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,287
Anybody who comes in
with a major wound,

375
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:39,588
we need to know about it.

376
00:20:43,677 --> 00:20:46,061
(gasping groan)

377
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,799
(stifled groans)

378
00:20:50,867 --> 00:20:53,936
Yeah. (Chuckles)
I got mugged.

379
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:55,771
They took my wallet
and my phone.

380
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:56,855
(winces)

381
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,874
Okay, Let me get
some more gauze.

382
00:21:08,718 --> 00:21:10,152
(fax machine beeps)

383
00:21:17,994 --> 00:21:20,546
(gun clicks) ANNIE: The nurse who
called it in, is doing her best to keep

384
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,731
her distance. Not alert Macon
that we're coming.

385
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,267
I heard you haven't
been sleeping much.

386
00:21:25,335 --> 00:21:27,303
(sighs) Marco.
Come on, there's nothing wrong

387
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,305
with a good old sex dream
from time to...

388
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:30,806
First of all, it is
none of your business.

389
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:33,008
Oh, yeah?
Second of all, they're...

390
00:21:33,076 --> 00:21:36,845
they're not sex dreams.
No?

391
00:21:36,913 --> 00:21:39,815
Third, you...
you kissed me, so...

392
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,400
Oh, yeah? How was I?

393
00:21:41,484 --> 00:21:42,651
Good?

394
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:43,736
(giggles) Huh?

395
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,903
It's time to go.

396
00:21:44,988 --> 00:21:47,055
Let's go.

397
00:21:55,965 --> 00:21:56,898
Hey.

398
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,734
Thought you said

399
00:21:58,802 --> 00:22:01,236
a doctor was coming
to sew this up.

400
00:22:01,304 --> 00:22:02,471
I'll call again.

401
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:06,175
(grunting in pain)

402
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,410
I'm losing a lot of bl...

403
00:22:12,849 --> 00:22:14,183
(gasps)

404
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,517
Drop the gun!

405
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:16,935
Drop the gun!

406
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:20,155
Slide it across
the floor! Go on!

407
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:23,192
I'm gonna let this lady go

408
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:26,928
when I get outside.
You could let her go now.

409
00:22:28,531 --> 00:22:30,098
(punch lands)

410
00:22:30,701 --> 00:22:32,701
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

411
00:22:32,702 --> 00:22:34,787
Two down, two to go.

412
00:22:41,025 --> 00:22:42,442
(Slaps Macon) Macon.

413
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,444
(coughs) Hey, Macon.
(snaps fingers)

414
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,445
Hey.

415
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,564
(panting)

416
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,499
Y-You broke my nose.

417
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:52,469
More like a hairline fracture.

418
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,871
Where are your friends going?

419
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,590
ANNIE:
Hmm?

420
00:22:56,674 --> 00:22:57,624
One of them stabbed you, right?

421
00:22:57,692 --> 00:23:00,944
Here's your chance to get even.

422
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:02,596
Little Boy stabbed me.

423
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,915
And he wasn't always like that.

424
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:06,750
He got out of prison all crazy.

425
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:08,819
Two years in maximum security.

426
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:09,970
It was rough.

427
00:23:10,054 --> 00:23:12,189
His cellmate hung himself
to get out.

428
00:23:12,256 --> 00:23:13,857
JIMMY: I asked you a question.

429
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:15,359
Where are they going?

430
00:23:15,426 --> 00:23:18,395
Little Boy kept talking
about some sort of stash

431
00:23:18,446 --> 00:23:20,197
he wanted to pick up.

432
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:22,115
Where is this stash?

433
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,650
I don't know.

434
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,319
Honest, I don't know.

435
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:27,788
Maybe back in New Orleans.

436
00:23:27,872 --> 00:23:29,940
We were headed
in that direction.

437
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:31,959
Everything we had,
we just left there.

438
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:36,914
Little Boy was always
talking about going back.

439
00:23:38,082 --> 00:23:39,833
I'll have Marco and Luke
check it out.

440
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,380
Clear!

441
00:24:12,183 --> 00:24:15,452
(dogs barking in distance)

442
00:24:17,822 --> 00:24:19,756
Place is empty.

443
00:24:19,824 --> 00:24:21,375
Yep.

444
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,844
It's been five years
since the flood.

445
00:24:23,928 --> 00:24:26,496
Thought they would have
cleaned this by now.

446
00:24:26,564 --> 00:24:28,465
This place looks like
my first apartment.

447
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:30,166
Smells like it, too.

448
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:44,031
Marco.

449
00:24:47,685 --> 00:24:48,702
Find the stash?

450
00:24:48,786 --> 00:24:50,554
Not exactly.

451
00:24:50,621 --> 00:24:52,355
Hey, Francis Washington's
Link Chart,

452
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,890
there anything about a kid?

453
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:55,625
A kid? No. Why?

454
00:24:55,693 --> 00:24:57,060
I think he's got a son.

455
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:02,249
Kid's name's "Kevin."
LUKE:

456
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:03,383
ANNIE:
How do you know?

457
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:05,052
Of the photo.
It's written on the back

458
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:09,256
"Kevin Price, born 2:12 a.m.,
August 11, 2004."

459
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,640
Different last name.

460
00:25:10,708 --> 00:25:11,641
Yeah.

461
00:25:11,709 --> 00:25:12,926
Sounds like a baby mama
situation.

462
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,144
That would explain why

463
00:25:14,211 --> 00:25:15,729
the Bureau of Vital Statistics
wouldn't have it.

464
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:27,491
Hey, Kevin, it's
me, your father.

465
00:25:27,558 --> 00:25:28,775
Daddy!

466
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:32,095
Daddy! Daddy!
Hey, there, Kevin.

467
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:35,499
FRANCIS:
This is your uncle.

468
00:25:35,566 --> 00:25:36,733
KEVIN:
Hi, uncle.

469
00:25:36,784 --> 00:25:37,768
Hey, kid.

470
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:42,973
Get out of my yard.

471
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,808
Hey, just give us
a minute to explain.

472
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,376
Kevin? Kevin, baby, go play.

473
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,681
I'll call the cops.

474
00:25:51,749 --> 00:25:54,017
Come on. Ease up. It's me.

475
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:55,986
What are you doing
here, Francis?

476
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,955
It'd be a big help if you'd
let us crash a few nights,

477
00:25:59,023 --> 00:26:00,590
and I also want to see Kevin.

478
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,995
He's getting big, huh?

479
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,029
Looks like me.

480
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:07,464
Kids grow a lot in two years.

481
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:13,170
You can stay for a few hours.

482
00:26:13,237 --> 00:26:14,154
No more.

483
00:26:14,238 --> 00:26:15,772
A few hours ain't gonna cut it.

484
00:26:15,823 --> 00:26:17,273
We need food, we need beds.

485
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,275
Little Boy,

486
00:26:18,342 --> 00:26:20,577
if she say we can't stay...

487
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:22,079
we gonna respect that.

488
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,618
You at least got
a first-aid kit?

489
00:26:33,257 --> 00:26:34,524
I'll show you.

490
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:36,960
Why don't you spend a few
minutes with your son?

491
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:55,212
He's good with that kid, huh?

492
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,647
You know, Allison...

493
00:26:57,698 --> 00:26:59,349
we're gonna leave

494
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:01,284
'cause that's what
Francis wants.

495
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:05,722
But if you're thinking
about calling the cops,

496
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,658
if you're thinking about
telling them anything,

497
00:27:08,726 --> 00:27:11,328
I'll come back here...

498
00:27:11,395 --> 00:27:13,697
and I'll kill that kid.

499
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,143
(sighs)

500
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:28,178
You know, you should
try to get some sleep.

501
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:31,548
We still got an got hour before
we get to Jackson. Fat chance.

502
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:34,017
(dry chuckle)

503
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:35,886
Yeah, me, too.

504
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,090
All this wedding planning stuff?
It's, it's...

505
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,992
I saw Natalie;
She came in

506
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:44,528
with that wedding binder thing.

507
00:27:44,595 --> 00:27:45,862
Yeah.

508
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:48,198
You know, she started
fighting with me,

509
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:49,699
and then she started talking

510
00:27:49,767 --> 00:27:51,935
about the wedding and...

511
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:55,272
how I'd sort of,
kind of been distant.

512
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:59,209
Then she asked me, she said,

513
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:02,012
"You know,
if I hadn't proposed to you,

514
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:05,015
you know, would you
have proposed to me?"

515
00:28:05,082 --> 00:28:06,883
And I... (chuckles)

516
00:28:08,819 --> 00:28:10,921
That's what you were talking
about the other day

517
00:28:10,988 --> 00:28:12,255
in the office?

518
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:13,723
I didn't have the answer.

519
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:15,292

00:36:57,796
headed south down the coast.

703
00:36:57,847 --> 00:36:59,314
Let's call the DEA,
Coast Guard,

704
00:36:59,399 --> 00:37:01,132
whoever can get us
a boat faster.

705
00:37:01,184 --> 00:37:02,467
(boat engine roaring)

706
00:37:06,773 --> 00:37:08,857
(engine slows)

707
00:37:08,942 --> 00:37:13,328

(siren wailing)

711

Hey!

712
00:38:10,803 --> 00:38:11,887
Head towards the cove.

713
00:38:13,273 --> 00:38:14,873
Can we get to him
before he lands?

714
00:38:14,924 --> 00:38:16,341
This is all we got?
That's it.

715
00:38:16,392 --> 00:38:17,342
Full throttle.

716
00:38:22,982 --> 00:38:24,216
Either of you got a shot?

717
00:38:24,284 --> 00:38:26,351
You can take out the engine?
Sure as hell try.

718
00:38:34,827 --> 00:38:36,662
(engine revving)

719
00:38:41,451 --> 00:38:43,568
Nice shot.
I impress every once in a while.

720
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,037
I guess you do.

721
00:38:50,927 --> 00:38:53,762
MARCO:
I don't see him.

722
00:38:59,469 --> 00:39:01,419
Where the hell did he go?

723
00:39:01,471 --> 00:39:03,588
He's got to be below deck.

724
00:39:23,376 --> 00:39:24,960
(gunshots)

725
00:39:25,044 --> 00:39:26,111
<i>Hijo de puta.</i>

726
00:39:41,494 --> 00:39:44,296
Stop shooting
or we will return fire.

727
00:39:44,364 --> 00:39:46,464
Come out,

728
00:39:46,516 --> 00:39:47,465
hands up.

729
00:39:55,525 --> 00:39:56,641
(gun clicks empty)

730
00:39:59,846 --> 00:40:01,113
(loud bang)

731
00:40:02,749 --> 00:40:04,249
(gasping)

732
00:40:05,484 --> 00:40:07,502
I can't... I can't...

733
00:40:07,587 --> 00:40:09,454
I can't hear!

734
00:40:09,522 --> 00:40:11,089
Come on out.
I want to see your hands.

735
00:40:15,345 --> 00:40:16,995
Let me see your hands.

736
00:40:17,046 --> 00:40:19,231
I can't see!

737
00:40:19,298 --> 00:40:20,298
I can't see!

738
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:47,859
Hey, Annie, Hank Lacy's outside.

739
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,661
He wants to shake your hand.

740
00:41:04,394 --> 00:41:06,445
Turn around.

741
00:41:06,512 --> 00:41:08,563
I said turn around.

742
00:41:11,451 --> 00:41:13,068
Dad.

743
00:41:13,152 --> 00:41:15,420
Annie.

744
00:41:15,488 --> 00:41:18,890
What's the matter, sunshine?

745
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:20,425
You afraid?

746
00:41:21,994 --> 00:41:25,230
No.

747
00:41:25,298 --> 00:41:27,766
Why haven't you found me yet?

748
00:41:27,834 --> 00:41:31,870
Takes time.

749
00:41:31,938 --> 00:41:36,241
Maybe you're not sure
you really want to find me.

750
00:41:36,309 --> 00:41:39,277
You recognize this, don't you?

751
00:41:42,748 --> 00:41:43,849
That's Mom's ring.

752
00:41:45,184 --> 00:41:46,468
Mm-hmm.

753
00:41:49,755 --> 00:41:53,458
Why didn't you send this to me.

754
00:41:53,526 --> 00:41:56,027
You know why.

755
00:41:58,297 --> 00:42:01,800
Something bad is
about to happen.

756
00:42:18,581 --> 00:42:22,000
Chase 2x17
