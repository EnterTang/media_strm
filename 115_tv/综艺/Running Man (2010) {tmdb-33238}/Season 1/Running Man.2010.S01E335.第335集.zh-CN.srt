1
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,270
(The third participant is...)

2
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,770
(Jee Seok Jin.)

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,140
My time has finally come.

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,110
I'm going crazy because I have so many things I want to do.

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,240
I want to put all of them in prison...

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,400
and be the king in there.

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:21,410
I want to have an event for my loving wife.
and be the king in there.

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,560
I want to have an event for my loving wife.

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,100
I'd like to challenge myself to something I couldn't do before.

10
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,460
Please do one of these three. I won't complain.

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,830
(Forget the past Seok Jin. It is a revenge he waited for 7 years.)

12
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,860
(If I'm unhappy, it'll be solitary confinement.)

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,260
(Abusing his authority will bring a terrible result.)

14
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,700
(He's had it for the past 7 years. He will get his revenge.)

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,430
(His counterattack is about to unfold.)

16
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,130
(A wedding town in Yeoju, Gyeonggi-do)

17
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,300
(Warm sunshine welcomes them to a forthcoming blessing.)

18
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,500
- It's warm. It's getting warmer. - It's sunny.

19
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,230
I guess this week's episode is about you.

20
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,300
- I think so. - Then please come to the center.

21
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,100
- Everyone can guess that. - Yes, it's obvious.

22
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,900
I assumed everyone's wearing a tuxedo.

23
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,960
- I'm the only one. - Seok Jin.

24
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,060
- Who wears pants like those? - This is...

25
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,300
- Look at his hands. - Seok Jin.

26
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,400
- It's cold. - You should've taken care of them.

27
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,730
The third participant of Member's Week is...

28
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,030
- Is it me? - It's Jee Seok Jin.

29
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,030
It looks like I'm getting married. It's obvious.

30
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,830
He's the third participant of Member's Week.

31
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,830
He's known as the dedicated husband in Running Man.

32
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,830
- Why is that? - I'm very devoted and loving.

33
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,360
Is it because of the lie detector?

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,630
He said he would remarry...

35
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,930
- his wife in his next life. - I am very dedicated.

36
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,430
I remember now.

37
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,660
"Will you marry your wife in your next life?"

38
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,060
(He nodded without giving a lot of thought.)

39
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,500
(He told the truth.)

40
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,200
(The title of the dedicated husband went to the wrong person.)

41
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,660
I am truly in love with my wife.

42
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,930
The evidence for it was broadcasted on a nationwide scale.

43
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,400
That's how I earned new nicknames such as The Devoted or The Loving.

44
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,700
We got married when she was quite young.

45
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,400
I haven't done any romantic events for her.

46
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,030
If I have the opportunity, it would be nice to do one.

47
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,730
He's a sunflower.

48
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:14,230
For Seok Jin who only cares about his wife,

49
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,400
we've prepared Seok Jin's vow renewal ceremony.

50
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,400
- Please enter the wedding hall... - Are you serious?

51
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,170
- where the bride is waiting. - Really?

52
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,670
- Your wife is here? - We could've come together.

53
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,730
- She said, "Have a good day." - This will be so touching.

54
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,360
- What is this? - Will I host the ceremony?

55
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,430
Of course, you will.

56
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,500
- I set you up with her. - Yes, you should host the ceremony.

57
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,860
(Thanks to an unexpected event, everyone is excited.)

58
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:42,460
(Just like the day 19 years ago, among the lights that bless them, )

59
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:50,030
(Seok Jin's beautiful wife stands before them.)

60
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,330
Congratulations, Seok Jin.

61
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,060
- What is this? - This is a wedding hall.

62
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,460
His wife will be here?

63
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:09,800
(Looking like she did 19 years ago, she waits for her husband.)

64
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,560
- His wife will be here? - Is it really her?

65
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,530
- Seok Jin. Mrs. Jee. - Are you really here, Honey?

66
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,730
(Honey, what are you doing there?)

67
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,030
- Is she really here? - Is that you, Mrs. Jee?

68
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,560
- Is it her? - It's not you, right?

69
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,030
- Is that you? - I don't think it's her.

70
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,560
- Who is it? - Is that you?

71
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,500
- I don't think it's her. - It's not her?

72
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,860
Is that her?

73
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,900
(Thank you for the past 19 years. I'll take better care of you.)

74
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,360
- Is that her? - Hey.

75
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,630
(What's going on?)

76
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,960
- It's Lee Seul. - What?

77
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,900
It's Lee Seul?

78
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,060
Hey, you.

79
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,600
- Are you kidding? - You do all sorts of things now.

80
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,630
- What's wrong with you? - You do all kinds of things.

81
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,330
- Are you my wife for the day? - You are so brazen.

82
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,660
- You look like my youngest sister. - Hey, you.

83
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,930
(What? Are they police officers?)

84
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,300
- What's going on? - What is this?

85
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,630
- My goodness. What's going on? - Why are they here?

86
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,530
(The police officers are on the move.)

87
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,560
- Why are they coming to us? - What is it?

88
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,030
- Come on. What is it? - What's going on?

89
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,330
- This always happens. - Come on.

90
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,330
- We did something wrong again. - What are you doing?

91
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,700
- What did we do wrong? - Why are you doing this?

92
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,330
What did we do? Hold on.

93
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,800
What's the matter? Lee Seul!

94
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,860
- Kwang Soo. - Lee Seul.

95
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,260
- What's happening? - We're at a wedding hall.

96
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,860
- Be careful. - What is it?

97
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,000
I thought they were going to renew their vows!

98
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:31,860
Where are we going?

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,700
- Why are you doing this? - Hold on.

100
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,470
This is ridiculous. Come on.

101
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,860
(Their arrest warrants have been issued out of the blue.)

102
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,900
(Where are we going?)

103
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,200
- My goodness. - Where are we headed?

104
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:43,730
Where are we going? Seok Jin. Where are we going?

105
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,430
- That's what I want to ask, too. - I really don't know.

106
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,600
Hey, someone's taking me somewhere.

107
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,160
- This is so scary. - First, let Ji Hyo...

108
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,600
- I'm going, too? - Let go of me. Let go!

109
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,260
After the opening segment, I've been dragged around all day long.

110
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,160
(Where is this place?)

111
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,800
(It's Seok Jin's Prison, the shrine for criminals from variety shows.)

112
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,060
(It's a correction center that has strict management and control.)

113
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,930
(One rule of Seok Jin's Prison is not to ask and not to talk back.)

114
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,060
(Will they be able to escape from this suffocating prison?)

115
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,560
Now, you can take your blindfolds off.

116
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,860
- What is it? Where are we? - My goodness.

117
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,060
(The prisoners get to see some light after an hour.)

118
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,760
- What is it? - This is a prison.

119
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,900
- We are in prison. - My gosh.

120
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,260
- Seok Jin's Prison. - It says "Seok Jin's Prison".

121
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,830
- "Seok Jin's Prison"? - What is this?

122
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,060
"The boss' word is the law." Are you the boss?

123
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,730
Seok Jin, the participant...

124
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:39,160
of this week's episode, wanted everything in here.

125
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,500
- He wanted this? - Yes, I did. However,

126
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,430
- this is not... - What's wrong with you?

127
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,160
I only said that I wanted to put all of you in prison.

128
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,760
I thought about it and I have something.

129
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,900
I spent more time in prison than I did outside.

130
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,200
I want them to experience how painful it feels to be in prison.

131
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,130
I want to put all of them in prison...

132
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,700
and be the king in there.

133
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,060
(He will humiliate the rest of them in his hometown.)

134
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,700
- I told them to put you in prison. - Seok Jin.

135
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,100
Then why did you wear a tuxedo?

136
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,930
- Why did you put me in, too? - Goodness.

137
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,060
- Why did we go to the wedding hall? - Yes, why did we?

138
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,130
- Why am I here? - Seok Jin.

139
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,960
Your wife wanted you here.

140
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,100
Is that what happened?

141
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,700
Why am I here?

142
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,500
Your sentence in this prison is six hours.

143
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,560
You will follow the schedule which has been already made for you.

144
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,900
Seok Jin is the boss of this prison.

145
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,260
I am the boss?

146
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,030
He has the absolute authority.

147
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,960
He can send whoever offends him and causes...

148
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,960
chaos in the prison to solitary confinement.

149
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,860
- My time has finally come. - This is too cruel.

150
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,300
Is it scary to be in solitary confinement?

151
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,730
For your information, solitary confinement will be beyond...

152
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,260
your imagination. Whatever you imagine, it'll be worse.

153
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,960
(Solitary confinement is a mysterious and unpredictable place.)

154
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,530
Whatever you imagine, it'll be worse.

155
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,530
(Solitary confinement is...)

156
00:06:54,530 --> 00:07:00,360
(the deepest and the dreariest place in prison.)

157
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:05,030
(Solitary confinement is the darkest place in Seok Jin's Prison.)

158
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,500
- Behave. I'm the boss today. - Seok Jin's the boss.

159
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,960
- We'd better listen to him. - You'd better.

160
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,430
You. Don't make eye contact with me.

161
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,000
- You. - Don't look him in the eye.

162
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,100
Don't look at me like that.

163
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,360
(He seizes the chance and stands next to the boss.)

164
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,930
- Are you my right-hand man? - Yes, Sir.

165
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,900
Hey, Right-hand.

166
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,330
- Yes, Sir. - He's annoying me.

167
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,960
I'm sorry but I believe I look more like the right-hand man.

168
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,700
You can be my right-hand man, too.

169
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,030
So it's starting again.

170
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,760
Be quiet. Look down.

171
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,260
Honestly, I'm okay, right?

172
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,730
- Be quiet. - Look down.

173
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,200
I'll be your pet dog!

174
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,860
Really?

175
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,630
(However, the sweet taste of power leaves its bitter aftertaste.)

176
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,930
- What is this? - What is this?

177
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,100
(The 6 prisoners start their life at Seok Jin's Prison.)

178
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,830
What is happening?

179
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,200
It's only the beginning.

180
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,000
(Why the sirens?)

181
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,860
Is six lives of imprisonment beginning now?

182
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,730
Six lives of imprisonment?

183
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:56,900
I meant six hours.

184
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,700
I'm the boss.

185
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,600
You made a mistake.

186
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,900
You said six lives of imprisonment.

187
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,560
"Is six lives of imprisonment beginning now?"

188
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,700
(Are you making fun of the boss?)

189
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,700
I think he'll be sent away to solitary confinement soon.

190
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,130
You shouldn't do that.

191
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,160
Okay. I understand.

192
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,330
I wanted to apologize.

193
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,430
(All power in Seok Jin's Prison comes from Seok Jin.)

194
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,760
(The boss' word is the law.)

195
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,530
I'll be asking you...

196
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,730
to compliment...

197
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,230
(Compliment your boss.)

198
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,360
your boss today.

199
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,430
I'll be asking each one of you one by one.

200
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,460
(I have to lie to my conscience.)

201
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,130
If I don't like it, you'll be sent to solitary confinement.

202
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,130
- Okay. - Even one word matters or else.

203
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,760
Ji Hyo, make an acrostic poem for Jee Seok Jin.

204
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,700
Jee.

205
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,660
At this very moment...

206
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,530
I like how it starts.

207
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,960
Seok.

208
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,960
Whatever Seok Jin says...

209
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:52,860
Jin.

210
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,200
I love him with all my heart.

211
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,600
(She exchanges her conscience with her fake heart.)

212
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,260
(This is what power tastes like.)

213
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,360
What is she doing?

214
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,730
Haha, make an acrostic poem for Jee Seok Jin.

215
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,100
Jee.

216
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,030
Mind your own business.

217
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,230
(Mind your own business.)

218
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,800
It's only the first line.

219
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,960
- No, I didn't mean that. - You should listen to the rest.

220
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,960
So I have to listen to the rest?

221
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,600
You have to wait until the end.

222
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,100
Seok.

223
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,400
You should try to be like Seok Jin.

224
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,400
(You should try to be like Seok Jin.)

225
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,600
If I don't like it, you are going to solitary confinement. Jin.

226
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,960
He's a real man.

227
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,260
He's a bulldozer.

228
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,830
Go, Seok Jin.

229
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,800
(The last part about the bulldozer was touching.)

230
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,930
Go, Seok Jin, the icon of power.

231
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,500
(I like it.)

232
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,570
Okay.

233
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,730
- Jong Kook. - Yes.

234
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,430
Make an acrostic poem. Jee.

235
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,260
Dear Jee Seok Jin.

236
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,700
Seok.

237
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,160
I apologize.

238
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,260
- What is this? - Jin.

239
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,330
I sincerely apologize...

240
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,830
for making fun of you in the past.

241
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,860
- What has happened to him? - I can feel his sincerity.

242
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,530
(The solitary confinement card makes him get on his knees.)

243
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,230
(This is what power tastes like.)

244
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,860
Jae Seok, make an acrostic poem.

245
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:07,660
Jee.

246
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,260
Jee Seok Jin!

247
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,660
(Jae Seok is a well-known expert in making fun of Seok Jin.)

248
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:19,760
(Seok Jin used to be his easiest mark.)

249
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,330
(How will he praise the absolute power that empowered Jong Kook?)

250
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,400
Jee.

251
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,330
Jee Seok Jin.

252
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,030
Seok.

253
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,030
The billionaire.

254
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:29,760
What's that supposed to mean?

255
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,260
What do you mean by that?

256
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,730
Why billionaire?

257
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,000
You're really funny.

258
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,530
- That's what acrostic poem is like. - But I actually feel good.

259
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,030
- I know, right? - Billionaire.

260
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,860
- Jee Seok Jin, the billionaire. - Jin.

261
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,400
You're the real billionaire.

262
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,700
(He is very satisfied.)

263
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,460
It's meaningless.

264
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,300
- What exactly does he mean? - Why are you satisfied?

265
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,330
Isn't he making fun of you?

266
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,800
- Billionaire sounds nice. - You are the true billionaire.

267
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,660
(Jae Seok's second acrostic poem)

268
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:58,560
Who is he to boast around and pretend he is the boss,

269
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,460
bossing us around like that?

270
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,060
He's trying to take everything for himself.

271
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,530
You should go to the solitary confinement.

272
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm not done with my poem yet.

273
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,560
Was that for the letter "Jee"? It's that long?

274
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,260
- He's not done yet. - That was for "Jee".

275
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,460
- He's not done. - I was just starting.

276
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,260
- Can you repeat the poem? - Of course.

277
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,830
- Can you repeat the poem? - Yes, I can.

278
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,560
Who is he to boast around and pretend he is the boss...

279
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,560
(I'll say it again if you want.)

280
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,530
(He is upset.)

281
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,900
- However, - However?

282
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,500
- Seok. - you're the true billionaire.

283
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,060
Why a billionaire?

284
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,730
- What does that mean? - That's how you make a poem.

285
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,560
- What is that? - Why is he satisfied?

286
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,300
That's how you make an acrostic poem.

287
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,600
- Jin. - You're the true billionaire.

288
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,630
- What does that mean? - He's the richest man.

289
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,000
Strangely, I feel good when he calls me a billionaire.

290
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,230
- Yes, you're a billionaire. - I love hearing that.

291
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,430
That means he's rich.

292
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,360
- Stand over there. - By the way,

293
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,500
- Stand over there. - Are we working for an hour?

294
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,200
Boss, how does this schedule work?

295
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,030
I simply wanted to lock you up.

296
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,230
This isn't fair.

297
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,430
(Falling)

298
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,330
How dare you say that?

299
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,630
Hey. Hey!

300
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,330
- I'll use the card on you. - What card?

301
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,860
- The solitary confinement card. - Where is it?

302
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,800
- It's in here. - Where? Let me see.

303
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,360
- It's in here. - Where? Do you really have it?

304
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,800
- It's right here. - You really do.

305
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,030
Okay, Sir.

306
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,230
(I must have lost my mind for a minute.)

307
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:19,560
- You shouldn't behave like that. - Okay, Boss.

308
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,630
- Send him away. - He should learn to look down.

309
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,760
- Stand up. Who told you to sit? - Okay.

310
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,260
- He should be sent away. - Okay.

311
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,000
I must have been out of my mind for a moment.

312
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,760
- I'll be obedient. - Okay.

313
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,730
Make an acrostic poem for Jee Seok Jin. Jee.

314
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:31,900
Jee.

315
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,300
You must be a nutcase.

316
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,160
(How could he...)

317
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,700
Send him to solitary confinement!

318
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,560
(He's the first prisoner at the solitary confinement.)

319
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,400
- Hey. - Go. Go away.

320
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,400
- I'm so sorry. - Solitary confinement.

321
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,460
- What I said... - Send him away!

322
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,130
- Wait, wait. - You need to be punished.

323
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:52,260
- Can this part be broadcasted? - Yes, it can.

324
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,460
- It can? - It will be censored.

325
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,300
This can't be happening to me.

326
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,730
It's really a solitary confinement?

327
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,400
(This room will make 5 minutes seem like 5 years.)

328
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,960
They told us that solitary confinement is really scary.

329
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,600
Even I don't know what it looks like.

330
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,930
- What is this? - What is it?

331
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,630
- What is it? - No!

332
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,630
What is it?

333
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,160
(He tries to run away.)

334
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:16,900
- What is this? - What's happening?

335
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,060
- Is this real? - He doesn't seem to be faking it.

336
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,660
(How scary is the place?)

337
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,600
No, no.

338
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,160
(It's an unknown place where you don't know what will happen.)

339
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,360
Please!

340
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,630
No.

341
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,930
(It's creepy.)

342
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,030
No.

343
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:41,160
(Finally, the doors to the solitary confinement are open.)

344
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,200
(Surprised)

345
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,160
What is this?

346
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,730
What is all this?

347
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,600
(This solitary confinement serves as a healing room.)

348
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,730
(It's a comfortable, healing spot that can help everyone relax.)

349
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:01,860
This is the best place ever.

350
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,530
The solitary confinement is the best.

351
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,860
(Is this really happening? Cheer for solitary confinement!)

352
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,200
(This is the best thing ever.)

353
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,700
This is really cool.

354
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,830
(There's plenty of nutritious food for the prisoners.)

355
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,630
I feel sorry for Seok Jin.

356
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,730
What should I do? They even have sweets.

357
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,260
(This is a 5-minute-long rest at the solitary confinement room.)

358
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,600
I really like it here.

359
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,300
I was taken aback.

360
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,900
(The others have no idea.)

361
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,430
It's so comfortable.

362
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:38,060
(This is the future-oriented and advanced Seok Jin's Prison.)

363
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:41,230
(Meanwhile, the other prisoners don't know what's going on.)

364
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,260
You look cool.

365
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,760
- Give me a massage. - He wasn't lying.

366
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,300
- Is this all real? - Of course.

367
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,630
Of course.

368
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,800
You look charismatic.

369
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:56,160
Jae Seok has made fun of me all his life.

370
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,500
- You did well. - Hey.

371
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,000
You should also...

372
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,400
smile a bit more.

373
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,060
(Smiling)

374
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,300
Yes, that looks better.

375
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,800
(He's fully enjoying the power.)

376
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,930
This feels good.

377
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,800
- Jae Seok should behave. - He should.

378
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,830
(Jae Seok, have a taste of the solitary confinement.)

379
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,960
(I'm going to have a taste of this citrus tea.)

380
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,260
I think I'll be the only one coming here.

381
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,800
You have two minutes left.

382
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,660
What do you mean two minutes? I just came in here.

383
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,760
(A minute in here feels like a second.)

384
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,360
(He's enjoying his leisure time with a cup of tea.)

385
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,760
This feels nice.

386
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,760
It's better than my house.

387
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:39,430
(It's the perfect day to drink citrus tea.)

388
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,330
What?

389
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,400
(The guard approaches him.)

390
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,130
I can't go out now.

391
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:46,400
I haven't been here for long.

392
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,830
Wait... I...

393
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,100
I just made my tea.

394
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,800
(Can't a man drink some tea?)

395
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,500
I'll be back before it gets cold.

396
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,600
I'll be back soon.

397
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,830
(I'll have the solitary confinement all to myself.)

398
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,200
Are we going to follow the schedule?

399
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,900
- Of course. - There's a schedule.

400
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,460
- We have to work first. - What kind of work?

401
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,800
What kind of work?

402
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,230
Maybe it's something like shoveling?

403
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,060
- It could be an exercise. - Maybe it's pulling weeds?

404
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,160
You are really good at working.

405
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,760
- What? - You can just sing "Last Love".

406
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,030
("Last Love" works best.)

407
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:23,230
(He's the best worker with a sweet voice and snake-like eyes.)

408
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,400
(He is embarrassed.)

409
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,530
I'm so sorry.

410
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:30,030
I'm so sorry. I won't do that again.

411
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,060
- What is happening? - He sounds well-disciplined.

412
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,230
I won't do that again.

413
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,030
It's so cold in there.

414
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,460
It's really cold.

415
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,100
- It sounds real. - Did he say it's cold?

416
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:42,830
- No, I'll never do that again. - He says he won't do it again.

417
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,960
- I'll never do that again. - What is it like in there?

418
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,660
He has become a little child.

419
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,360
- What's he saying? - I won't do that again.

420
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,830
- Has he been disciplined? - What did you do?

421
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,400
You are well-disciplined.

422
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:53,600
It's so cold in there.

423
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:54,960
Attention.

424
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,400
At ease.

425
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,730
- Attention. - He's really doing it.

426
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,060
- He must have been sitting on ice. - He's obedient.

427
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,400
I will never ever make the same mistakes.

428
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,730
Show me the Grasshopper Dance.

429
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,130
(I will dance any time.)

430
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,300
Now, the Dooly Dance.

431
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,860
(To return to the solitary confinement, he's doing his best.)

432
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,560
I don't want to go back there again.

433
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,200
- Never? - Never.

434
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,700
- Are you curious? - No, I'm not.

435
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,900
- Tell me if you want to go there. - No, I don't want to go there.

436
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,600
(He swears his loyalty to the boss.)

437
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,960
(What is the sound?)

438
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,330
What's going on?

439
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,700
It's time for the first task.

440
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,830
(Their work starts.)

441
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,130
What's going on?

442
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,960
What is that?

443
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,960
(Why is there a sack?)

444
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,060
Are they making us search for barley?

445
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,730
(That's exactly it.)

446
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,700
(It's the most tedious work.)

447
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,600
Do we have to separate the red beans?

448
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,200
(They must separate yellow and red beans.)

449
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,600
- Seriously? - Do we need to separate the beans?

450
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,160
Do you want us to separate them?

451
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,360
The boss doesn't have to do it.

452
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,400
He can distribute the work to the others.

453
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,100
Shouldn't the boss do it, too?

454
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,430
What did you say?

455
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,430
How dare you say that?

456
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,560
- Show your respect to the boss. - Hey, hey.

457
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,700
Starting now, Jae Seok shall treat Haha with respect.

458
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,130
- Okay, Sir. - Haha is above Jae Seok.

459
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,000
- Thank you. - Call him Mr. Haha.

460
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,300
Say Mr. Haha.

461
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,400
This isn't right, Seok Jin.

462
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,730
(Seok Jin is being immature.)

463
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:09,960
Call him Mr. Haha.

464
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,900
Gosh, Mr. Haha.

465
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,130
(Haha can't believe what he heard.)

466
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,200
- You're above him. - Goodness.

467
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,830
Kwang Soo, you're above...

468
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,000
- Jae Seok as well. - Okay, Sir.

469
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,530
Call him Mr. Kwang Soo.

470
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,330
Come on.

471
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,800
(How dare you disrespect me?)

472
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,000
Hey, you.

473
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:32,660
- He deserves a beating. - He's not well-disciplined.

474
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,200
I don't like his attitude.

475
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,560
(It's time for solitary confinement again.)

476
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:36,960
- Jong Kook. - Yes, Sir.

477
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,360
You're above Jae Seok, too.

478
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,430
Of course, I already knew that.

479
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,700
- You don't need to mention it. - That's obvious.

480
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,160
- Ji Hyo is above Jae Seok. - Ms. Ji Hyo.

481
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,770
- Separate the red beans now. - Okay, Sir.

482
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,860
- We'll work hard. - You're a community.

483
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,200
- Understand? - Yes, Sir.

484
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,830
Do you know why I'm the boss? I've been here for 20 years.

485
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,500
- It's been that long. - When will you be released?

486
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,860
I received a 20-year sentence for loving my wife too much.

487
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:04,130
(Seok Jin brags.)

488
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,700
My only sin was loving my wife too much.

489
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,700
Jae Seok, which crime did you commit?

490
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,700
I'm an economic criminal.

491
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,400
I shouldn't even be confined here with you.

492
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,500
Didn't you commit petty crimes?

493
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,900
(Did he say petty crimes?)

494
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,600
(Jae Seok tries to aggravate him.)

495
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,830
(It's his strategy to go back to solitary confinement.)

496
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,230
(He considers sending him back.)

497
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:35,330
I heard that you were caught gambling.

498
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,200
- Everyone, stand up. - No.

499
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,130
(He orders everyone to stand up.)

500
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,660
Everyone, get up.

501
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,770
- I didn't say anything. - I told you.

502
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,460
You're a community, so everyone, get up.

503
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,400
- Stand in one line. - Why are you interrupting us?

504
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,900
(Jae Seok is making it worse for everyone.)

505
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,500
Why are you interrupting us?

506
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,770
Line up like a train and hold the waist in the front.

507
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,770
- Like a train? - Right.

508
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,000
Sit down.

509
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,730
Duckwalk around the cell once.

510
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,200
- Are you serious? - Come on.

511
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,930
- Start. - Wait.

512
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:05,030
Say, "The boss' word is the law." The boss' word...

513
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,930
- Is the law. - The boss' word...

514
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,360
- Is the law! - The boss' word...

515
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,500
(Seok Jin spots Jae Seok.)

516
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,400
- Is the law! - What are you doing?

517
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,100
- What are you doing? - What's wrong?

518
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,770
(Send me to solitary confinement.)

519
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,700
Don't you understand the situation?

520
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,830
- We're in prison. - Calm down, Haha.

521
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,460
Send Jae Seok to solitary confinement.

522
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,500
(He deserves to be punished.)

523
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,860
(Jae Seok is sent to solitary confinement.)

524
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,930
- Good job. - I'm sorry, Sir.

525
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,270
- I'm sorry. - Go now.

526
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,960
I wasn't strong enough to suppress my stress.

527
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,600
I couldn't control my anger.

528
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,660
- He deserves worse punishment. - I'm sorry.

529
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,230
(He's excited to drink some tea.)

530
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,230
I'm sorry.

531
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,860
(He passionately acts.)

532
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,960
I'm really sorry.

533
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,930
Solitary confinement must be terrible.

534
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:51,060
- He didn't change much physically. - Right.

535
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,100
I wonder if they torture him psychologically.

536
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:58,600
(Solitary confinement is better than hotels.)

537
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,800
(He enjoys some snack.)

538
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,000
Kwang Soo might have noticed.

539
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
(Kwang Soo is the curious type.)

540
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,230
I wonder what he does over there.

541
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,770
You should go if you're curious.

542
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:18,160
- Do you want to go? - It's okay, Sir.

543
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,270
Kwang Soo is too curious to stay still.

544
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,500
Jong Kook.

545
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,000
(To Kwang Soo, )

546
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,800
(solitary confinement is a world full of mysteries.)

547
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,770
No!

548
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,930
(Come in. You won't regret it.)

549
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,860
- I won't do it ever again. - Go to the corner and kneel.

550
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:46,300
- Why don't you behave yourself? - Go and kneel.

551
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,600
(Is something good in the solitary confinement?)

552
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,930
Kwang Soo, aren't you curious about the solitary confinement?

553
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,560
- Aren't you? - I'm curious.

554
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,600
Right?

555
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,200
Hit Seok Jin's head once and check it out.

556
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,830
I'm not sure.

557
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,460
(He hesitates to go.)

558
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,200
Are you curious?

559
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,200
(Are you bold enough to be curious?)

560
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,800
(Kwang Soo decides...)

561
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,460
(to check the world of the unknown.)

562
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,360
(It's a mutiny in prison.)

563
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,460
Go ahead.

564
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,500
(It's too easy to go to solitary confinement.)

565
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,360
- Go ahead. - Stop it.

566
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,460
(He sends Kwang Soo.)

567
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,000
- I'll be back. - Have a good time.

568
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,600
- Have a good time. - I'm too curious.

569
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,460
(Is he really the boss?)

570
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,100
- Go ahead. - It's too hard to stay curious.

571
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,500
(Kwang Soo is nervous to find out.)

572
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,500
It's better to find out.

573
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:40,030
Wait, no!

574
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,200
- What could it possibly be? - Goodness.

575
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,560
(They get curious more and more.)

576
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,500
(He starts to smile.)

577
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,860
(He screams.)

578
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,760
(This is amazing!)

579
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,130
(Is this solitary confinement?)

580
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:00,960
(He welcomes himself.)

581
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:02,930
Please!

582
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,860
(It's a new type of solitary confinement.)

583
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,260
Did you already separate this many?

584
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,600
Jong Kook is good at it.

585
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,660
He's very good at tedious work.

586
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,660
(Jae Seok gets playful.)

587
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,230
He's very good at tedious work.

588
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,100
(Stop doing tedious work.)

589
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,030
What's wrong with you?

590
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,360
(He wants to provoke everyone.)

591
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,930
- Have you lost your mind? - What's wrong with you?

592
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:27,200
Why?

593
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,500
- Why are you doing this? - Why not?

594
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,130
- You don't need to do this. - I worked hard.

595
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,930
(The tedious task hypnotizes the prisoners.)

596
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,760
(The boss is angry.)

597
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,130
What is it?

598
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,300
(He flips Haha's bowl.)

599
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,600
What are you doing?

600
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,030
Do you want to know?

601
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,130
(If you're curious...)

602
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,400
Do you want to start?

603
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,860
(You know what to do.)

604
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,930
(Just kick Seok Jin.)

605
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,100
Yes, I want to know.

606
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,930
(Just kick Seok Jin.)

607
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,260
I want to know.

608
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,600
Take out the card now.

609
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,300
I want to go to solitary confinement.

610
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,830
This is unbelievable.

611
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,000
(Everyone sends themselves to solitary confinement.)

612
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,300
(He heads there himself.)

613
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,730
We can work on this again together. Don't worry.

614
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,300
What's all this?

615
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,900
(Is this solitary confinement?)

616
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,100
No!

617
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,130
(It's the best room ever.)

618
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,500
- What kind of room is this? - I have to leave if you come.

619
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,600
Leave.

620
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,760
Why didn't you take more time?

621
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,760
(Haha is happy he came.)

622
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,700
(He lost his power as the boss.)

623
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,600
It's not like we'll be leaving any time soon.

624
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,000
- Gosh. - You can start over.

625
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,500
Are you out of your mind?

626
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,830
(Seok Jin gets ready to act like a boss.)

627
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,560
(Ready, )

628
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,660
(set, go!)

629
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:40,560
(The boss takes revenge.)

630
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,200
What happened? Why did you do that?

631
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,860
(Seok Jin takes it out on Jong Kook.)

632
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,400
(Seok Jin is no longer the boss.)

633
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,830
Did you fall on your own?

634
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,800
Come here now.

635
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:56,930
Have you lost your mind?

636
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:59,200
(Will this be the end of Seok Jin?)

637
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,500
- Are you crazy? - Go to solitary confinement.

638
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,100
Are you crazy?

639
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,130
(Seok Jin tries to boss around.)

640
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,500
You were the best target to push.

641
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,200
I thought Jong Kook fell over on purpose.

642
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,330
Open the door!

643
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,500
(Jong Kook's counterattack will continue.)

644
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,730
My goodness.

645
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,600
I hope solitary confinement teaches him a lesson.

646
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,130
No!

647
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,460
What's that sound?

648
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,600
It's quite difficult in solitary confinement.

649
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,030
What is it like?

650
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,830
(Rumor has it, )

651
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:31,030
(it's the most luxurious solitary confinement ever.)

652
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,130
Seok Jin is over there alone.

653
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,230
(He can't stop laughing.)

654
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,560
(Jong Kook arrives.)

655
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,500
(Solitary confinement makes them laugh.)

656
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,230
What's this?

657
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,000
Goodness.

658
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,500
- What's going on here? - Get a foot massage.

659
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,230
Shall I get a foot massage?

660
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:52,930
(It's a prestigious place to rest for the top one percent.)

661
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,000
I won't do it again.

662
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,360
Everyone becomes obedient after being in solitary confinement.

663
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,360
It's interesting.

664
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,630
- What's in solitary confinement? - What is it?

665
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,400
What is it like?

666
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,600
(Thank you for sending me there.)

667
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,300
- Go back there again. - No way.

668
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,100
(Go back there again.)

669
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,730
- No! - He's being rude.

670
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:20,730
(He tries not to laugh.)

671
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,300
No!

672
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,030
(Seok Jin abuses his power.)

673
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,300
Go back now.

674
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,730
Don't use the card carelessly.

675
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,930
- Please don't send him. - Go back.

676
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:32,000
(Seok Jin doesn't listen to anyone.)

677
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,360
You go back, too.

678
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,560
(Haha pours the beans on him.)

679
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,630
You, go back.

680
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,230
(Everyone wants to win the solitary confinement card.)

681
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,100
(Everyone wants to go.)

682
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,960
No, no.

683
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,300
- You, too. - He sent me away, too.

684
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,700
- No, please. - Go now.

685
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,030
Forgive me this time.

686
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,460
I won't forgive you.

687
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,700
Go now.

688
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:53,400
- He sent me there as well. - I can't believe them.

689
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,100
How dare they?

690
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,360
No!

691
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,430
(He gets giddy.)

692
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,460
(They love it here.)

693
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,730
- What? - It's really delicious.

694
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:03,300
I bet he can't even imagine this.

695
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,330
No.

696
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,360
Only Ji Hyo hasn't been here.

697
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,900
It's because she doesn't know.

698
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,000
What is she doing?

699
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,230
I should teach them a lesson.

700
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,230
(Ji Hyo is working hard.)

701
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,400
If I go, you'll be left here alone.

702
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,500
- What? - If I go, you'll be here alone.

703
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,200
When were you ever worried about that?

704
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,960
I'll take the card out.

705
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,500
(I need to calm down.)

706
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,230
(Teasing)

707
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,560
(He adds oil to the fire.)

708
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,000
Stay still. Don't move.

709
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,830
I'm going to hit your cap.

710
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:42,760
(My goodness!)

711
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,330
I was being patient with you.

712
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:49,430
- Hey. - Go ahead. Take the card out.

713
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:51,260
(You don't have to explain.)

714
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,460
She needs solitary confinement.

715
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,800
- These punks. - Open the door.

716
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,860
(He sends everybody away.)

717
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,230
These punks.

718
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:01,730
(He is left alone.)

719
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,500
Hold on.

720
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,730
This is solitary confinement.

721
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,830
(Welcome to our house!)

722
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,460
- Start yelling, Ji Hyo. - You're finally here.

723
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,660
Start yelling.

724
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,830
What's all this?

725
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,130
- I'll give you some. - Take a tangerine.

726
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,730
Take some tangerine. The fried banana is really good.

727
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,230
The strawberries are really good.

728
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:32,500
(Gosh. I should have been nicer to them.)

729
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:38,800
(I wonder what the other members are doing.)

730
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,030
(It's paradise here.)

731
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,400
It's paradise here.

732
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,330
(She's happy to be in solitary confinement.)

733
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,560
I understand now.

734
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,130
(Siren)

735
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,160
(What's this again?)

736
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,400
What's that?

737
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:57,030
(It's the meal time.)

738
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,600
- Are we done here? - Are we done?

739
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,400
You can continue tomorrow.

740
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,060
- Yes. - Fine, finish tomorrow.

741
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,300
- I'm hungry. - I'm so tired.

742
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,230
I'm hungry. It's food.

743
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,930
- It looks good. - It looks delicious.

744
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:11,360
- This is my favorite. - It's pastry.

745
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,160
- It looks good. - It looks delicious.

746
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:18,360
(Are we supposed to eat this?)

747
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:23,730
(What about all the food we stuffed down our throats?)

748
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:26,100
- Bring it over here. - It's filled with whip cream.

749
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,660
- Bring it over here. - We'll give it to you after.

750
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,830
Bring it over here.

751
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,560
(Looks delicious.)

752
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,430
- You haven't had these, right? - Boss, I really want some.

753
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,300
- I want some so much. - I'm very hungry.

754
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,530
Smell it.

755
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,730
(You want some, right?)

756
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:43,000
(Chuckling)

757
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,230
(They crack up.)

758
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,400
What?

759
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,700
- Get out. - Get out.

760
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,800
- Get back. - Get back.

761
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,130
- What's wrong with you? - Are you out of your mind?

762
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,660
What's his problem?

763
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,500
- What's he doing? - Why is he laughing alone?

764
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,600
(Smell it, Jae Seok.)

765
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,660
It smells so good.

766
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,600
You thought I was giving it to you, right?

767
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,300
(Seok Jin faked it.)

768
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,430
(Chuckling)

769
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,700
What? What's wrong?

770
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,960
(Please stop.)

771
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:11,900
Come here.

772
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,430
My mouth is getting watery.

773
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,030
- I almost had it. - Hey.

774
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,100
(Jae Seok tries to trick him. He pretends like he's hungry.)

775
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,030
What's wrong with him?

776
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,200
Even if you are hungry and want some food...

777
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:32,900
(They all devour the food.)

778
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,860
You guys.

779
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,030
(They're in a state of anarchy.)

780
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,360
(Kwang Soo targets the authority figure.)

781
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,430
Hey.

782
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,960
(They all act like they're hungry.)

783
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,360
Leave, Kwang Soo.

784
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,230
Are you making me go again?

785
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,330
- My gosh. - Go.

786
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,760
Drop it in three.

787
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,930
In 1, 2, 3.

788
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,260
Leave.

789
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:56,160
- You can leave. - Eat before you leave.

790
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,400
- Let me eat. - Follow them.

791
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,700
I won't let you do that.

792
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,100
(Whatever!)

793
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,160
Come on.

794
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,730
Let me eat.

795
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:06,760
Give it back.

796
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,230
(Seok Jin takes all the pastries away.)

797
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,530
You kids. I feel so bad for you.

798
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:18,560
(You shouldn't be.)

799
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,000
Seok Jin was so funny.

800
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,160
He asked if I wanted some.

801
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,160
(He almost burped.)

802
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,460
We have so much food here so why would I want some?

803
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,960
I'm too full to eat now.

804
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,460
I'm too full.

805
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,330
(Seok Jin takes the food away from each person.)

806
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,860
It's really good.

807
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,760
(Seok Jin takes the food away from each person.)

808
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,500
(Smiling)

809
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,760
Stop eating. Give it back.

810
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,930
(He almost threw up from eating too much.)

811
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,930
(Munching)

812
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,230
- You should have let me eat. - Come here.

813
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,930
I feel bad for you.

814
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,060
(Here's some food.)

815
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,960
- Eat it. - That's not fair.

816
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,330
- You should eat. - Eat it.

817
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,760
Finish it.

818
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,900
- You worked hard. - It's from the boss. Finish it.

819
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:07,100
- Be thankful. - It's only for you, Jae Seok.

820
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,100
Say, "Thank you for the food."

821
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,960
Go ahead. Say it.

822
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,600
- Thank you... - Eat it.

823
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,660
Hurry up and eat it.

824
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:18,060
- Eat. - Thank you.

825
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,330
I sent you to solitary confinement the most.

826
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,600
- He did. - I'm sorry.

827
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,960
- It's okay. - Eat.

828
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:26,130
I'm starting to tear up. I'll stop eating.

829
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,430
Eat.

830
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,500
- Eat. - It's from the boss.

831
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,900
(Don't try to play smart.)

832
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,730
(Siren goes off.)

833
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,830
What? I didn't get to eat and this is over already.

834
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,500
Is it over?

835
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,530
(The meal time is over. It's now time to exercise.)

836
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,430
I don't usually exercise.

837
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,900
What about this? We can play Statues.

838
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,100
Person that loses heads to solitary confinement.

839
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:52,430
(Person that loses will head to solitary confinement.)

840
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,860
(All right. The loser heads straight to solitary confinement, right?)

841
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,660
(Come to me.)

842
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,830
If you lose, you're going to solitary confinement.

843
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,260
- Yes. - What if you don't lose?

844
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,200
If there's no loser, I'll go there.

845
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,330
- Okay. - I'll go.

846
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:10,330
- Let's do this. - Let's do this.

847
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:11,760
- In 1, 2, 3. - We can do this.

848
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,930
Okay.

849
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:19,530
(Let's make this look natural and proceed quickly.)

850
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,930
- Make it quick. - Okay.

851
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,000
Flowers are in full bloom.

852
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,660
(Flowers are in full bloom.)

853
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,100
Flowers are in full bloom.

854
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,360
(Flowers are in full bloom.)

855
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:33,700
Flowers are in full bloom.

856
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,730
(Falling)

857
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,100
What was that for?

858
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,760
- I'm sorry. - What was that?

859
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,300
What was that for?

860
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,130
(Haha is going to solitary confinement.)

861
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,630
- What was that? - No way.

862
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,960
- No way. - Just go.

863
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,400
(Why are you pretending like you're weak?)

864
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,600
Come here.

865
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,830
- You can't do that. - What was that?

866
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:58,060
- You can't do that. - That was too easy.

867
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,630
- Go. - Please.

868
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,730
- Go. - Leave now.

869
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:03,900
- No way. - You can't do that.

870
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,530
- I saw him. - No.

871
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,730
- That was too easy. - I saw it clearly.

872
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:10,100
- No. - You can't do that.

873
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,730
(Seok Jin is happy he's not going and rest are sad they're not.)

874
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:15,230
This is good. You can't talk back.

875
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,630
(They're ready for Round 2.)

876
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:22,600
(We don't have time. There's not much space in solitary confinement.)

877
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,460
You look like a leader.

878
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,670
- I agree. - Flowers are in full bloom.

879
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,900
(Halting)

880
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,900
(She stops too late.)

881
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,760
(Oh, dear.)

882
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,670
- Ji Hyo. - Come on, Ji Hyo.

883
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,030
What was that for?

884
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:39,500
- Please, Seok Jin. - That looked natural.

885
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,670
You're supposed to be better than this.

886
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,830
You were better.

887
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,460
- It wasn't me. - Come on, Ji Hyo.

888
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,700
- Come on. - Hold on.

889
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:48,630
He's being too intense.

890
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,560
- You guys are cute. - He's being too intense.

891
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,560
- My goodness. - What are we supposed to do?

892
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,330
(Haha and Ji Hyo are the lucky ones.)

893
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:56,460
What happened?

894
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,170
(Haha and Ji Hyo are the lucky ones.)

895
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:59,200
Let's have some gimbap.

896
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,170
It was so cold there.

897
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:03,430
- They're... - They're trying to lose, right?

898
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,960
They're all trying to lose.

899
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,360
Let's go.

900
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,360
(It's Round 3.)

901
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,170
(It's a three way competition.)

902
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:14,630
I think you're cute.

903
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:17,360
You're being so good and obedient today.

904
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,330
Flowers are in full bloom.

905
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,860
You're done.

906
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:25,130
(It's the law of inertia.)

907
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,530
(Dashing)

908
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:27,900
- Hold on. - No way.

909
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,060
- You can't. - That wasn't it.

910
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,170
That was too weird.

911
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,030
- Let's go again. - That was fake.

912
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,960
- You saw it, right? - No way.

913
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,300
I was going too fast that I couldn't stop.

914
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,000
- But still... - This is filmed.

915
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,600
- Let's go again. - That's too much.

916
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,430
- I can't let it go. - That looked too fake.

917
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,100
Go. Hurry.

918
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,460
That wasn't good.

919
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,800
(Jae Seok is the third person to leave for solitary confinement.)

920
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:52,260
(Welcome, my friend.)

921
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,760
What was that for, Ji Hyo?

922
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,360
- Jae Seok. - That was too obvious.

923
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,700
- That was too fake, Haha. - Come on.

924
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,400
What was I supposed to do then?

925
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,230
(It's final round.)

926
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,930
(I must lose.)

927
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,430
- Flowers are in full bloom. - Ouch.

928
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,600
(Lying down)

929
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,400
You were worse.

930
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,670
(Jong Kook is out.)

931
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,430
- I can't go now? - You can't. Stay here.

932
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,000
(Everyone but Kwang Soo heads to solitary confinement.)

933
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,400
- I'm sorry. - Don't be.

934
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,430
Give me some gimbap. Let me have some.

935
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:28,960
I almost didn't make it.

936
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,000
Jae Seok.

937
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,670
- What? - I almost didn't make it.

938
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,860
- What is that? - There's something in here.

939
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,630
(Why is there a map in gimbap?)

940
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,560
(What's this?)

941
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,900
- There's something in here. - What's that?

942
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,530
It must be an escape route.

943
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,100
(My gosh!)

944
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:46,100
(They found a map of the prison.)

945
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,170
There's a 3rd room on the 3rd floor. What's this?

946
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:52,900
(Is this about escaping the prison now?)

947
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,930
Is the clue just one?

948
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:56,000
So this was about escaping.

949
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,100
- It's an escape game. - It is.

950
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:02,100
(That was something unexpected. Would they manage to escape?)

951
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:05,800
(Everybody is enjoying their time in prison.)

952
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,930
People...

953
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,400
(Attention, prisoners.)

954
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,130
- People? - Convicts.

955
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,730
You have mail.

956
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,700
- Mail? - Mail?

957
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,300
(Is it mail from the outside world?)

958
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,930
- Who is it for? - Who sent it?

959
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,330
- Is it for me? - It must be from your girlfriend.

960
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:21,700
To the guy who falls in love quickly?

961
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,060
(What is this?)

962
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,860
- It must be for you. - It says so here.

963
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,330
He dropped something.

964
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:28,430
Seok Jin.

965
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:30,000
(Jae Seok finds a mysterious piece of paper.)

966
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,530
(Let's share the information.)

967
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,730
- Let me see. - He dropped it.

968
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:36,060
- He dropped it. - "From 3pm..."

969
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,400
(It must be something important.)

970
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,230
- What is it? - "Electrical equipment inspection"?

971
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,030
(It will take about 10 minutes from 3pm.)

972
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:45,530
(Wait.)

973
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:50,330
(It means the guard will be away for 10 minutes from 3pm.)

974
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:56,400
- It's a letter from my mom. - Really?

975
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,500
"Dear my son who falls in love quickly..."

976
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,460
(It should be Kwang Soo's official nickname.)

977
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,500
Don't do this.

978
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:06,330
- Keep reading. - You're hopelessly romantic.

979
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:09,330
"Dear my hopelessly romantic son, Kwang Soo."

980
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:12,000
"Are you doing well? It's been cold these days."

981
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,860
"I wonder who you fell in love with there."

982
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,300
"You've been always full of love."

983
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:21,530
"I'm so proud that you're hopelessly romantic. I love you, my son."

984
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:23,860
- "From your mom." - Mom.

985
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:26,830
- I'm sorry. - We should write a song about him.

986
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:30,560
Guys, a wedding invitation just arrived.

987
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,170
- What's that? - A wedding invitation?

988
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,230
(A wedding invitation?)

989
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,760
- A wedding invitation? - It's related to the wedding hall.

990
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,230
(They went to a wedding hall before being sent to here.)

991
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:40,730
- It's related to the wedding hall. - It is.

992
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:41,730
Is he taking us...

993
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:45,430
"Attend Seok Jin's wedding with all the other members."

994
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:49,930
"If you don't arrive at the wedding hall on time, you'll be penalized."

995
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:53,530
January 16 is today. What time?

996
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,260
"Jee Seok Jin and Ryu Soo Jeong"?

997
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:59,030
Ryu Soo Jeong? That's my wife's name.

998
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:03,800
(Will Seok Jin's bride be at the wedding hall?)

999
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,500
(If they don't arrive there by 5pm, the bride will disappear.)

1000
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:12,400
(My groom, please escape there.)

1001
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,430
Ryu Soo Jeong?

1002
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:16,460
(Could the map be...)

1003
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,700
What time is it now?

1004
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,700
I think we're supposed to escape using this map.

1005
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,000
We found a map earlier.

1006
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,800
We found a map.

1007
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,960
- Where? - At the solitary confinement.

1008
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,800
At the solitary confinement.

1009
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,170
(The solitary confinement, 20 minutes earlier)

1010
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,200
(They found a map on the wrapping paper by accident.)

1011
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,330
- What's that? - There's something on the paper.

1012
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,500
I think we're supposed to escape here.

1013
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:43,700
(High and sturdy iron walls)

1014
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,260
(Locked iron bars)

1015
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,430
(Passages full of mines)

1016
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,700
(Rappelling facilities)

1017
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:53,700
(We're supposed to escape here.)

1018
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,530
At the solitary confinement?

1019
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:58,630
We went through so much at the solitary confinement.

1020
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,230
We had to complete missions.

1021
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,230
We had to complete missions to acquire this.

1022
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,900
- Really? - Yes.

1023
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,760
We had to roll on the ice.

1024
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,200
Guys, there's no boss anymore.

1025
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,800
- We're one now. - We are.

1026
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,260
If we don't arrive at the wedding hall by 5pm,

1027
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,200
we'll all be penalized.

1028
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,960
- Do you understand? - We're one.

1029
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,170
- For your wedding. - One, two, three.

1030
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:19,460
- Let's do this. - Let's do this.

1031
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,800
(The prison break starts.)

1032
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,860
(The game is on.)

1033
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,230
(Aim for the 10 minutes when the guards are away.)

1034
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:32,030
(They must pass the four obstacles on the map to get out.)

1035
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:35,600
(They need to be at the wedding by 5pm for Seok Jin to meet his bride.)

1036
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,530
(The prisoners' escape starts.)

1037
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:42,670
(What will happen to them?)

1038
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,170
(Prison Break)

1039
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,960
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1040
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,260
We can't go now.

1041
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,900
Shouldn't the lights be off?

1042
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,030
They're not here.

1043
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,830
- There's an equipment inspection. - We have only 10 minutes.

1044
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,670
(What is waiting behind that door?)

1045
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,800
- The door should open. - The guards are away.

1046
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,170
- Where's everybody? - The door should open.

1047
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,730
Where's everybody?

1048
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,830
The door should open.

1049
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:10,130
- Where's everybody? - Where's everybody?

1050
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:12,760
- This is the solitary confinement. - Let me see.

1051
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,700
- What's this? - Didn't you know?

1052
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,760
(What is this luxurious room?)

1053
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:21,430
- I'm sorry. - Here is where we were confined.

1054
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:23,960
(You guys deceived me.)

1055
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:28,000
(He sent them to the solitary confinement.)

1056
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,300
(They had a luxury time in the solitary confinement.)

1057
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,600
(The man in power had no idea.)

1058
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,630
(He became a victim.)

1059
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,700
(Is this what I became the boss for?)

1060
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:43,560
- Were you guys here? - Let's take some candies.

1061
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,000
- Let's take candies. - What's on the other side?

1062
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,500
- Were you eating these? - Let's hurry.

1063
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:50,200
- Let's go. - This is no time for this.

1064
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,000
- What is this? - We don't have much time.

1065
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,930
Are we supposed to get through this within three minutes?

1066
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:55,530
To the opposite door?

1067
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:56,930
(It's impenetrable.)

1068
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:01,530
(They need to get through this door to get to the next route.)

1069
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:02,800
What are we supposed to do?

1070
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,400
- I don't understand. - Is there more?

1071
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,300
Are we supposed to go over the wall?

1072
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,360
(There must be something more.)

1073
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,800
- We can probably break this. - Break it.

1074
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,230
(This side doesn't look that sturdy.)

1075
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,560
- Break it. - Hurry.

1076
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,560
(It's open.)

1077
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,530
Are we supposed to go through this?

1078
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:20,560
- Go through it. - I'll go first.

1079
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,430
- Go through it. - One, two, three.

1080
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:25,300
- There's one at the bottom, too. - Where? Oh, I found it.

1081
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,600
- There's one at the bottom. - Hurry.

1082
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,400
- Wait. - Ji Hyo, go.

1083
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,330
Open the door.

1084
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:32,630
Can you open the door?

1085
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,330
- Can you open the door? - Open it.

1086
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:36,760
There you go.

1087
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,560
(Doors, be opened.)

1088
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,930
There's no key.

1089
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:41,630
- Hurry. - We need to go through here.

1090
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:43,460
- There is. - Did you find it?

1091
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,560
- There is. - Where should I go?

1092
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,670
- Kwang Soo, come here. - What should I do?

1093
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,000
Come down.

1094
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,430
- Come down here. - Should I?

1095
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:51,960
- Kwang Soo, come down. - Let's go.

1096
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:55,030
(They passed the 1st course with 3 minutes remaining.)

1097
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,060
Come down.

1098
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:58,930
- What's that? - It's on the map.

1099
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:01,430
- It's not that way. - Come here.

1100
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,230
We probably need to find the password.

1101
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,360
- Seok Jin, - What is the password?

1102
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,000
- when is your wife's birthday? - Could it be our anniversary?

1103
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,700
- When is your anniversary? - When is it?

1104
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,330
- Try 1031. - Try 7012.

1105
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:12,830
- Try 1031. - Try 1031.

1106
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:15,600
(They try her birthday first.)

1107
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,000
Try 1031.

1108
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:19,860
- It doesn't work. - Try 7012.

1109
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,830
- Are there any clues? - Is there nothing?

1110
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:23,900
(They try 7012 next.)

1111
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,430
- Are there any clues? - It doesn't work.

1112
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,060
It says, "Race Starter".

1113
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,760
It means Seok Jin.

1114
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,400
- It says, "Race Starter". - Try his phone number.

1115
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,500
Where?

1116
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,360
- That's you. - It says "Race Starter" here.

1117
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,630
Race Starter?

1118
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:39,670
(Race Starter is Seok Jin's nickname.)

1119
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:42,060
(Does Seok Jin have the password with him?)

1120
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:43,130
When is your birthday?

1121
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:45,830
Try 0210.

1122
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:48,760
- What if they start chasing us? - Is that the right way?

1123
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:52,760
- Race Starter is Seok Jin. - Isn't this how you do it?

1124
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,730
What if they start chasing us?

1125
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:56,100
Is this the right way?

1126
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,830
(What is this ominous feeling?)

1127
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:00,700
(It's 3:10pm. The inspection is over.)

1128
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,260
(The prisoners are attempting to escape.)

1129
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,500
(Arrest them immediately.)

1130
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,600
- Don't you have to push something? - Isn't it right?

1131
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,700
- What could Race Starter mean? - Race Starter.

1132
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,500
What could it mean?

1133
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,460
(What could the code mean?)

1134
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:17,160
- He needs to be out. - It's not right.

1135
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:18,500
- Out? - He's usually the first to be out.

1136
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:22,300
(Let's look back on the history.)

1137
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,130
(The name tag is ripped off.)

1138
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:29,030
(Seok Jin always started the race by getting eliminated first.)

1139
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:34,830
(The race starts when Seok Jin gets eliminated.)

1140
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:39,900
(Wait. Could there be something under Seok Jin's name tag?)

1141
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:43,630
(The name tag is ripped off.)

1142
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:45,260
- It's here. - Is there something?

1143
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:48,430
(They found a hint.)

1144
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:51,000
"The year Seok Jin debuted as a singer".

1145
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,760
"The year Seok Jin passed the comedian exam".

1146
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,700
(It's a summary of Seok Jin's life history.)

1147
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,460
"The year Seok Jin passed the comedian exam". Tell us.

1148
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:03,030
- It's 1992. - It's 1992.

1149
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:05,000
- It was there. - Hurry.

1150
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,130
You're amazing.

1151
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:08,630
Add them up. "The year Seok Jin debuted as a singer".

1152
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:09,930
"The year Seok Jin passed the comedian exam".

1153
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:11,760
- Do it one by one. - When did you debut?

1154
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,130
- I debuted in 1993. - Is it 1992?

1155
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:15,330
- Is it 1993? - Right.

1156
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:16,400
Remember it.

1157
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,960
- Add 1992... - It's 1992 plus 1993.

1158
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,000
- It's hard. - Does anyone have a pen?

1159
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,760
(Where are the prisoners?)

1160
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,460
(Motivated)

1161
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:28,900
- How are we going to do this? - Let's hurry.

1162
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:31,000
- When did you debut as a singer? - In 1992.

1163
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,060
- And? - As a comedian in 1993.

1164
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:37,000
- Okay. - As a host in 1994.

1165
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:39,360
- Is it 1994? - Yes.

1166
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:40,860
It's so hard.

1167
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:44,360
- Let's hurry. - Hurry.

1168
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,800
Let's add them together.

1169
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,200
Each person should remember one number.

1170
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:51,300
Let's multiply 2000 by 4 and subtract the numbers.

1171
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,660
Add 8, 7, 7, and 6 together.

1172
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:54,560
- Add them together. - Add 8, 7, 7, and 6 together?

1173
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,230
Try 7973.

1174
00:45:56,730 --> 00:46:00,960
(If they fail this time, they won't be able to escape.)

1175
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:03,130
(It's open.)

1176
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:05,060
- Okay. - Hurry.

1177
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:07,160
(It's 3:25pm. They passed the 2nd obstacle.)

1178
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,000
- Hurry. - Go up.

1179
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,830
- Go up. - Go up.

1180
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:13,200
(Move towards the 3rd course.)

1181
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:16,100
- What is this? - What is this?

1182
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,130
I know what it is.

1183
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:18,700
(What's ahead of them?)

1184
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,230
You should step on the right spots.

1185
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,960
(Find the right way.)

1186
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:26,730
(They have to start again if they step on a mine.)

1187
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,630
There's a monitor.

1188
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:31,830
That must be the right path.

1189
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,600
- We have to remember it. - I'll remember the last part.

1190
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:36,230
Three...

1191
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:37,800
- It's easy. - Three, three, two, one...

1192
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,560
- It's easy. - Two, two...

1193
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,560
- Three, three... - I memorized it.

1194
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,460
- If you memorized it, start. - Go.

1195
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:46,860
- Here... - The guards are following.

1196
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:49,060
- The guards are following. - Two, two...

1197
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:52,130
- Three, three, two... - They're almost here.

1198
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:54,360
(We'll catch them by all means.)

1199
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,860
- Two... - Here?

1200
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:56,900
Two...

1201
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,200
(He tripped.)

1202
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,900
What happened?

1203
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,100
(They can continue because he didn't step on it properly.)

1204
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:04,930
- There. - That way.

1205
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:06,700
(They will get caught if they make a mistake.)

1206
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,330
(Will they get caught or will they escape?)

1207
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,500
- It's that way. - It's that one.

1208
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,160
- There. - It's here.

1209
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,300
(They are all so loud.)

1210
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,630
- It's here. - It's here.

1211
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:17,830
(They're so close.)

1212
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:20,000
- It's this way. - It's over here.

1213
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,560
(They pass the 3rd obstacle.)

1214
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:25,730
(The current time is 3:30pm. They have 90 minutes left.)

1215
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:27,700
(One last obstacle remains.)

1216
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,600
- There's a game. - It's right behind you.

1217
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,100
- Is this it? - What is it?

1218
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,460
- Do we have to go outside? - What is this?

1219
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:35,400
- What is this? - Have they lost their mind?

1220
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,560
- No way. - This is impossible.

1221
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,630
- This can't be true. - We can't do it.

1222
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:43,130
(What's the last obstacle?)

1223
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:46,000
- I don't like it. - How could they make us do it?

1224
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,130
(Is it your 1st time falling from the 3rd floor?)

1225
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:50,630
- Let's just do it. - Seriously?

1226
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:51,930
(Here's the story behind the obstacle.)

1227
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:54,200
- What else can we do? - My goodness.

1228
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,860
I'd like to challenge myself to something I couldn't do before.

1229
00:47:57,860 --> 00:47:59,430
I'd like to challenge myself.

1230
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:02,800
If I make it, it would be very rewarding.

1231
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:05,200
I'll feel proud of myself.

1232
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,760
How can we do this?

1233
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:10,300
(We prepared something he's never done before.)

1234
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,230
(How can they do it?)

1235
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:14,560
(Many of them are afraid of heights.)

1236
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,430
- Are they being serious? - How could they make us do it?

1237
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:18,730
Let's put this on.

1238
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,230
(Haha can't believe it.)

1239
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,360
- What else can we do? - My goodness.

1240
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,630
Do we have to do it for real?

1241
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,500
- Are you being serious? - Gosh.

1242
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,300
(Yes, we're being serious.)

1243
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:31,060
- How? - Let's just go back to prison.

1244
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,900
This is unbelievable.

1245
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,530
(Welcome to the last stage of Seok Jin's Prison.)

1246
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:36,100
- How can we do it? - Is this it?

1247
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:39,960
We have professional help for our escape,

1248
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:42,060
- so don't worry too much. - Right.

1249
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:43,700
Staying in solitary confinement wasn't bad.

1250
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,160
Can you do it, Ji Hyo?

1251
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:47,400
- I'll do it first. - You go first.

1252
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,200
- She can do it. - She's the bravest one.

1253
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,560
(She's reliable.)

1254
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,260
Ji Hyo is the bravest one of all.

1255
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:54,460
Go ahead, Ji Hyo.

1256
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,230
- I trust you, Ji Hyo. - Okay.

1257
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:58,430
This place is too dangerous. You should escape first.

1258
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:00,430
(Kwang Soo lets Ji Hyo go first.)

1259
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:03,860
Jump off, Ji Hyo. Someone's coming after us.

1260
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:05,600
- It's not too high. - Can you do it alone?

1261
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,560
(The first to escape is Ji Hyo.)

1262
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,730
(It's frightening.)

1263
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:11,200
Turn around, Ji Hyo.

1264
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,930
- Tell us if you can't do it. - I can't do it.

1265
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:15,030
I don't think we'll make it to my wedding.

1266
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:17,530
- Be careful. - Hold the rope tightly.

1267
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:18,530
(She knows what to do.)

1268
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:20,560
- Like this? - She's doing it all alone.

1269
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,230
(She's not afraid at all.)

1270
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:24,700
(With cowardly members behind, )

1271
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:27,730
(she attempts to escape without any hesitation.)

1272
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:30,730
- Am I good to go? - Here you go.

1273
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:32,230
(The prison break starts.)

1274
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:34,400
- Hold onto this, Ji Hyo. - Be careful.

1275
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,430
(All 6 members must escape within 1 hour.)

1276
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:41,000
(Will all members escape successfully?)

1277
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,130
- Like this? - She's doing it all alone.

1278
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:47,000
(She descends with stability and composure.)

1279
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,360
- Hold onto this, Ji Hyo. - Be careful.

1280
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,930
- Am I set to go? - You're doing well.

1281
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:53,530
You're good enough to descend alone.

1282
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,300
- Am I set to go? - You're fine.

1283
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,000
(She descends...)

1284
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,600
(step by step.)

1285
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,500
- You'll be fine. - Am I set to go?

1286
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,430
We should be more worried about ourselves.

1287
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,230
- She's almost there. - You got it.

1288
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:06,400
(She descends lightly.)

1289
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,630
Ji Hyo is very good.

1290
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:09,100
She's talented.

1291
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,530
(It's a piece of cake.)

1292
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:12,530
- See? - She's good.

1293
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,430
- She's very good. - Guys.

1294
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:16,460
It's okay. It's not scary.

1295
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:18,360
It isn't scary for you.

1296
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,630
(Ji Hyo fears nothing.)

1297
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:21,460
I'm scared just by watching it.

1298
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:23,600
(She descends safely.)

1299
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,130
- I'm so jealous of her. - She made it. It's our turn.

1300
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,430
(She escapes successfully.)

1301
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:30,260
- Did she get to the ground? - Who wants to go next?

1302
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:32,760
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1303
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,760
(They play rock-paper-scissors to determine the order.)

1304
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:35,930
- Boss. - Let's hurry.

1305
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:37,760
Even if we get caught, you should escape.

1306
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:39,930
- Please go ahead. - I'll go last.

1307
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:41,300
(He gets special treatment.)

1308
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,600
(Who will go next?)

1309
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,560
(Kwang Soo loses.)

1310
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:48,830
(Unlucky Kwang Soo is selected.)

1311
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,260
Kwang Soo.

1312
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:53,530
(The sky expresses pity for Kwang Soo.)

1313
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:57,060
Goodness.

1314
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,930
(He doesn't understand why they're doing this.)

1315
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:02,260
It's not a real prison break, so what's the fuss about?

1316
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:04,600
(Right now, )

1317
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,200
(the guards are coming after them.)

1318
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,930
- Let's hurry. - Go now.

1319
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:11,060
- Hurry up. - Shut your mouth.

1320
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:13,000
Go up now.

1321
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,360
- How do I do this? - Haven't you done it before?

1322
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,830
(The next one to escape is Kwang Soo.)

1323
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,630
I've never tried it before.

1324
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:21,460
(The whistles keep blowing.)

1325
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:22,860
- Hey. - They're coming.

1326
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:25,200
(He's upset about the reality.)

1327
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,660
- You're younger than me. - Gosh.

1328
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:28,660
(He's afraid to escape.)

1329
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:30,630
- Come on, Kwang Soo. - This is too difficult.

1330
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:33,100
- You're set. Go on. - This is too harsh.

1331
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,360
- Go down. - We don't have enough gears.

1332
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,130
(All he has is one rope.)

1333
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:38,400
It's okay. Just go.

1334
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,000
- Gosh, Kwang Soo. - Wait.

1335
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,460
- I might fall off. - It's okay.

1336
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:44,230
- I'm going to fall off. - Turn back and go down.

1337
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:45,830
(He can't move at all.)

1338
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:47,560
- How? - Just go.

1339
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:50,130
- Grab this. - Otherwise, they'll catch us all.

1340
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:51,300
Hold on the right.

1341
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:52,430
(Kwang Soo might not survive.)

1342
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:54,260
- Get on all fours. - It moves down.

1343
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:57,200
- It moves down. - Hurry up and come down.

1344
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,560
(Kwang Soo is too cowardly.)

1345
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,000
My goodness.

1346
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,100
I'll stay in prison forever if I have to.

1347
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:03,860
- I can't do this. - Just go down.

1348
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:07,500
- Come on, Kwang Soo. - You brake with your right hand.

1349
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:09,030
That's not it.

1350
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,460
(He's too scared.)

1351
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:17,230
(Will they make it to the wedding?)

1352
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:19,030
- Put your feet down. - There you go.

1353
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:20,860
(He can't make himself escape.)

1354
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:21,900
Put your feet down.

1355
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,300
Put your feet down.

1356
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:25,060
Kwang Soo.

1357
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:26,930
- Stay alert. - Hey!

1358
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:28,330
(He gets dizzy.)

1359
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:30,300
(Escaping is too hard for him.)

1360
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,830
Let go of the rope a little.

1361
00:52:31,830 --> 00:52:33,300
(He descends slowly.)

1362
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,030
- Do it slowly. - You'll be okay.

1363
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:38,000
- You're descending. - There you go.

1364
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,530
(He squirms.)

1365
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:41,130
It's getting faster.

1366
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:42,830
No, you can control the speed.

1367
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:44,460
(He moves slowly like a praying mantis.)

1368
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:47,260
- Don't look down. - Keep descending.

1369
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,200
- This is very scary. - He's almost there.

1370
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,700
(They're proud of Kwang Soo.)

1371
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,930
- He's almost there. - I'll just stay in prison.

1372
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:55,030
I can't do it.

1373
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:57,100
(He barely descends to the 2nd story.)

1374
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:58,760
- I can't do it. - He's almost there.

1375
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,200
Do you have any water?

1376
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:01,500
Do you have water?

1377
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:03,400
I'm getting dizzy.

1378
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,500
Kwang Soo, you must come down now.

1379
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,200
- That's right. - Hurry up.

1380
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,630
(Too much time passed.)

1381
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:13,560
- You're almost there. - The ground is too far.

1382
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:16,300
You won't die even if you jump off.

1383
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:20,630
Keep your legs still and lower your bottom.

1384
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:24,460
- Keep your legs straight. - Why hasn't he moved at all?

1385
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:26,430
(He can't control himself.)

1386
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:28,560
- What on earth is he doing? - Wait!

1387
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,860
(He can't control his body.)

1388
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:32,430
- I straightened my legs. - What's going on?

1389
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:34,500
- Hurry up! - How?

1390
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,930
- Do I let go? - Yes.

1391
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:37,530
- Do I let my legs go? - Let them go.

1392
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:40,000
(He's close to the ground.)

1393
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,400
- Let them go. - There you go.

1394
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,200
- He's descending. - There he goes.

1395
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:45,230
(He descends very slowly.)

1396
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:46,500
(Dragging)

1397
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:48,330
He's going down.

1398
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:49,860
(He lands on his back.)

1399
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,760
He's very startled.

1400
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,230
He looks pale.

1401
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,130
Was it scary, Kwang Soo?

1402
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,630
(He almost died.)

1403
00:53:57,630 --> 00:53:59,030
Thank you.

1404
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:02,230
- Turn around. - I'm afraid of heights.

1405
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:05,600
- I'm really terrified of heights. - We know.

1406
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,630
(He makes a big fuss.)

1407
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:09,460
- We know it better than anyone. - I hate high places.

1408
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:10,500
(There isn't much time left.)

1409
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,260
It gets easy after you take the first step.

1410
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:16,130
(He must lean outside the window.)

1411
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:19,830
- Lean your legs against the wall. - Is this how you do it?

1412
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:22,130
(He spreads his legs wide.)

1413
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:24,360
- Is this it? - Is this how I do it?

1414
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:29,030
(He's determined to marry off Seok Jin today.)

1415
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,500
(Will Jae Seok make it to the ground?)

1416
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,200
This is how you do it.

1417
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,500
(He stumbles.)

1418
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,660
- There you go. - Is this right?

1419
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:40,330
(He descends while jumping awkwardly.)

1420
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:41,930
- Like this? - That's right.

1421
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:44,460
- I'm afraid of falling backwards. - Okay.

1422
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:46,630
He's doing well.

1423
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:48,130
(Jae Seok turns into Spiderman.)

1424
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:49,330
Do it like this.

1425
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:53,300
- He's very brave. - Watch me carefully.

1426
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:54,960
- It's okay if you hold on tightly. - Why are you trembling?

1427
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,560
- Look at Jae Seok. - It's because I'm too scared.

1428
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:01,330
Jae Seok is brave enough to lean back like that.

1429
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:02,330
(He's determined.)

1430
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,700
Jae Seok is brave enough to lean back like that.

1431
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,100
(He lands lightly.)

1432
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:08,630
Jae Seok.

1433
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:10,330
(Jae Seok escapes successfully.)

1434
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:12,500
- You did it. - My goodness.

1435
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,160
You're the best, Jae Seok.

1436
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,460
(Only 50 minutes remain.)

1437
00:55:16,330 --> 00:55:19,400
- Are you taking the same position? - Wait.

1438
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:22,460
- What's wrong? - My neck feels stiff.

1439
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,200
(His neck hurts in the back.)

1440
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,000
We're such cowards.

1441
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,860
(We're a team of cowards.)

1442
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:31,760
Hurry up.

1443
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,130
Haha, it's okay.

1444
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:36,330
We have to get to the wedding.

1445
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:37,930
- You're set. - Wait.

1446
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:38,930
(Haha is too scared.)

1447
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:41,030
- Wait, Jong Kook. - You're set.

1448
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:42,230
(Please call the ambulance.)

1449
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:44,230
Put your feet out first.

1450
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:45,930
- Put your feet out first. - Wait.

1451
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:47,000
(He's too afraid to move.)

1452
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,300
Move your legs first.

1453
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:51,130
Push your bottom out and straighten your legs.

1454
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:52,460
I can't straighten my legs.

1455
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:54,230
(Haha can't make himself do it.)

1456
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,130
You must lean back.

1457
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:58,230
(Kwang Soo gives advice based on his experience.)

1458
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,230
Just trust the safety guards.

1459
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:01,200
(Kwang Soo forgot about his past.)

1460
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,400
(Haha finally leans out.)

1461
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,830
Hold the rope with both hands.

1462
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:07,100
- There you go. - You got it.

1463
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:10,860
(He's no longer a coward.)

1464
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:13,930
(He will show what being a real man is all about.)

1465
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:15,660
- I can't go down. - Use your legs.

1466
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:17,260
No, wait.

1467
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:19,830
(He fails to descend.)

1468
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:21,930
I can't do it.

1469
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:23,530
- Goodness. - I can't go down.

1470
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:24,600
I'll go first.

1471
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,300
(He blames the rope for not working properly.)

1472
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,330
Take a rest.

1473
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:31,030
I'll try it again. I almost made it, didn't I?

1474
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:32,430
You punk!

1475
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:35,630
Hurry up. We have a wedding to attend.

1476
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:37,500
Lower yourself slowly.

1477
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,830
- Can you pull me up? Sorry. - What's wrong?

1478
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:41,100
Let go of your right arm.

1479
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:42,230
(He fails again.)

1480
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:44,030
You're gripping too hard with the left hand.

1481
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:45,200
(It's not that complicated.)

1482
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:46,760
Okay, I'll do it.

1483
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,830
I'll imagine Dream is down there.

1484
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:49,830
That's right.

1485
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:50,930
(He remembers that he's a father.)

1486
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:53,660
- I must go down to save him. - That's right.

1487
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,330
(As a father, he's determined to succeed.)

1488
00:56:59,430 --> 00:57:01,000
(Dream, are you watching me?)

1489
00:57:01,830 --> 00:57:03,460
- Here I go. - Go.

1490
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:09,830
(Haha was terribly afraid of heights.)

1491
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:14,600
(He hated being in high places.)

1492
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:19,330
(He was never manly enough.)

1493
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,530
(He challenges himself as a father and not just a man.)

1494
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:24,660
- I'm going. - Go.

1495
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:28,730
- I need to save Dream, right? - That's right.

1496
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:30,900
(Haha takes small steps thinking about Dream.)

1497
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:33,460
Don't worry. You did it.

1498
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,630
You did it. That's it.

1499
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:37,100
- Good job. - That's it.

1500
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:39,300
- He's losing focus. - That's it.

1501
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,130
- You did it. - Good job.

1502
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:43,100
- There's a window coming up. - Good job.

1503
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:45,560
- You're good. - All right.

1504
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:47,600
You're special forces.

1505
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,000
- Good job. - Why are you so good?

1506
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,230
- All right. - Oh, my goodness.

1507
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:52,160
(He lands on 2nd floor.)

1508
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:54,260
Go at once.

1509
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:58,330
(Haha is Dream's father and not a coward.)

1510
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,560
(I can do it.)

1511
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,860
- Come straight down. - You're good.

1512
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:03,100
- Come straight down. - All right.

1513
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:04,800
You're good.

1514
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:06,600
That's right.

1515
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:08,760
Dream!

1516
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,200
- I came here to save you. - Dream.

1517
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,900
- Why are you mentioning Dream? - What did he say?

1518
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:14,360
- Dream. - What did he say?

1519
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,600
Why are you mentioning Dream?

1520
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:18,130
I came down to save you.

1521
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,900
Why are you mentioning Dream?

1522
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:21,160
It's really not flattering.

1523
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,960
- It really isn't. - Why are you mentioning Dream?

1524
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,560
- Why did he say his name? - I love you!

1525
00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:27,930
The 7 of us are 1!

1526
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:30,560
- Why are you mentioning Dream? - I did it.

1527
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,600
- Why are you mentioning Dream? - Dream.

1528
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,030
Why are you mentioning Dream?

1529
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:35,300
You did it.

1530
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:38,030
- You can do it. - For goodness' sake.

1531
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:39,630
(He feels pressured because all the cowards did it.)

1532
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:41,060
This is driving me nuts.

1533
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:43,630
- It's your wedding, Seok Jin. - Seok Jin.

1534
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:45,900
We're doing this because of you.

1535
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,660
- Seok Jin. - This is all your fault!

1536
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,900
It's your wedding, Seok Jin.

1537
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:52,560
(Thank you but can I not go?)

1538
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:57,060
Put your right hand near your waist.

1539
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,930
Bring the rope to your right. It's too near the back.

1540
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,960
- Move your right hand. - Like this?

1541
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:05,160
Let go. They're holding on so you won't fall.

1542
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,230
(Well...)

1543
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:08,560
He can't.

1544
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:10,830
Do you want to go to my wedding first?

1545
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:14,060
Do you want to go first and collect money gifts?

1546
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,160
- Tell them I'm going to be late. - Seok Jin.

1547
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:20,560
You can let go a little. You won't fall.

1548
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,160
- That's brake. - Okay.

1549
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,130
Haha, can you be quiet?

1550
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,360
I don't think you're in any position to tell me what to do.

1551
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,560
- You can do it. - You just need to take a step.

1552
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:31,100
- I'm more of a coward than you. - You two can't tell me what to do.

1553
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,160
- Exactly. - Seok Jin.

1554
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,930
- Even I did it. You can do it. - This is nothing.

1555
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:37,530
- Is it good? - It's good.

1556
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:41,400
- Let's go. - My left hand is weak.

1557
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,000
- Is it all right? - Use your right hand.

1558
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,300
(Would Seok Jin manage?)

1559
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:50,660
(Seok Jin's dream is to have a romantic wedding.)

1560
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:54,930
(They must get to the venue in 40 minutes to make it happen.)

1561
00:59:54,930 --> 00:59:56,960
It's your wedding, Seok Jin.

1562
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:59,500
The instructors will take care of it.

1563
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,660
- I didn't do it by myself. - That's good.

1564
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:04,860
- You're good. - Let go of your right hand.

1565
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:06,160
You're good.

1566
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,600
- Let go. - You're good.

1567
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:08,900
Let go. The instructors will help you.

1568
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:11,530
- Use your right hand. - Let go.

1569
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:13,730
- You're good. - You're almost there.

1570
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:16,730
- You're almost there. - Wait. It's going too fast.

1571
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:18,430
- It's going too fast. - Don't worry.

1572
01:00:18,430 --> 01:00:21,360
- It's going too fast. - Let go of your right hand.

1573
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,100
Let go and grab it again.

1574
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:25,300
- It's hardest in the beginning. - All right.

1575
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:27,930
What do you need?

1576
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:31,230
Look above.

1577
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:33,660
Why are you dancing?

1578
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,600
You're almost there.

1579
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,260
(He does a twist on the wall.)

1580
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:39,400
- You're almost there. - I think he got it.

1581
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:41,300
Let go of your right hand.

1582
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:43,060
Don't hold on. Let go.

1583
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:44,330
- Should I let go? - Yes.

1584
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:47,060
How? How am I supposed to let go?

1585
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:49,360
Let go. You can let go.

1586
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:51,360
Let go. You have to.

1587
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:52,830
Look at him.

1588
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:54,000
My gosh.

1589
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,060
- I wasn't that bad, right? - You weren't.

1590
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:57,560
Didn't I look cool near the end?

1591
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:58,630
You did.

1592
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:01,730
You know what's worse about this?

1593
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:04,460
When Kwang Soo was stuck before,

1594
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:07,560
he said, "You won't hurt yourself even if you jumped down from there."

1595
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:08,860
(He was being so harsh to Kwang Soo.)

1596
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:10,960
I'm so embarrassed.

1597
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,030
(I respect you, Kwang Soo and Haha.)

1598
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:14,960
- It was so difficult. - I'm happy that I'm on the ground.

1599
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,000
(There's only Jong Kook left.)

1600
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:18,660
- I was afraid the rope would break. - I'm coming.

1601
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:21,300
- Hurry up. - Use your right hand.

1602
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,560
He'll be fine.

1603
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:29,660
(There are prison guards that are after Jong Kook.)

1604
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:35,160
(Will Jong Kook safely escape prison?)

1605
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:37,030
(He's incredible.)

1606
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:40,700
- Listen to that. - Be careful.

1607
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:43,260
He's like Spiderman.

1608
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,330
Be careful.

1609
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:48,630
You can let go.

1610
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:50,430
He escaped.

1611
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:53,460
- That was so simple. - It's good.

1612
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:54,930
(It would be that easy for me if I did it again.)

1613
01:01:54,930 --> 01:01:56,360
- I can do better if I did it again. - Same here.

1614
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:59,000
- I think... - You're number one.

1615
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:01,360
Hurry up. There's no time.

1616
01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:03,200
Let's go.

1617
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,330
There are guards after us.

1618
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:07,300
- Let's go. - There are guards after us.

1619
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:08,900
This isn't necessary.

1620
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,460
Guards are after us.

1621
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:11,900
(Soo Jeong is waiting for her groom.)

1622
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:15,030
(Will Seok Jin reach her for the wedding?)

1623
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:18,360
(What's awaiting the members after their escape?)

1624
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:22,060
What's this?

1625
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:24,500
What's this?

1626
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:26,400
- What's this? - What's this?

1627
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,300
Please stand in front of the boxes.

1628
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:30,730
- Can we open it? - I was wearing this in the morning.

1629
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:33,000
I was wearing this in the morning.

1630
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:34,230
I don't have mine.

1631
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:35,660
Seok Jin is missing his.

1632
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,330
(His tuxedo is gone.)

1633
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:40,960
Seok Jin, you must be the naked groom.

1634
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,200
"Answer questions about your wife to get your clothes."

1635
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:46,500
"The box with the correct answer has the tuxedo."

1636
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,630
You won't just give it to me?

1637
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:50,000
(If his answer is incorrect, he'll get something unexpected.)

1638
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,100
- What's this? - You should just give it to me.

1639
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:54,500
You thought he'll forget about their first kiss?

1640
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,000
- Right? - Look at the question.

1641
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,800
- Why would I not know? - You don't remember?

1642
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,300
You know me.

1643
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:02,160
We used to spend a lot of time in my car when we were dating.

1644
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:05,100
We were by the riverside and I asked my wife to count...

1645
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:06,730
if 63 Building actually had 63 floors.

1646
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:09,000
That's how much time we spent in the car.

1647
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:11,030
- Car. - Are you sure?

1648
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:12,360
- Open it. - Are you sure?

1649
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:14,860
- Of course. It has to be. - It's for sure.

1650
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:18,900
(He was so confident. What's in the box?)

1651
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,230
It's for sure.

1652
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:23,260
- What a relief. - You don't even have to think.

1653
01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:24,930
This is great.

1654
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:27,400
- Can he open the other ones? - What's that one?

1655
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,900
(What's in the other boxes?)

1656
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:30,030
They're straw shoes.

1657
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:32,330
- It would have been funny. - You almost had these.

1658
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,260
"What gift does your wife want for this wedding anniversary?"

1659
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:36,700
- This one's difficult. - It's a tough one.

1660
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:38,660
- I think I know. - Really?

1661
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:40,230
- I think it's vacation. - I think I know.

1662
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:41,830
- That's not it. - What about a handbag?

1663
01:03:41,830 --> 01:03:43,360
- A handbag? - A ring and necklace?

1664
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:45,200
- It is 100 percent this one. - That's right.

1665
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,460
- Really? - He didn't even hesitate.

1666
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:48,230
- He didn't even hesitate. - That's what she would want.

1667
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:49,860
It's 100 percent ring and necklace.

1668
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:52,330
(He's becoming more confident.)

1669
01:03:52,330 --> 01:03:55,630
(Will he get two in a row?)

1670
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:58,460
(He's correct. He gets tuxedo pants.)

1671
01:03:58,830 --> 01:04:00,700
- He's a true lover. - Why am I so good?

1672
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:02,060
That's so cool.

1673
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:05,060
- You look so cool. - Why do I know my wife so well?

1674
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:06,160
It's nothing.

1675
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,600
- Hold on. - What you wore to the first date?

1676
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:10,960
I don't know about mine.

1677
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,200
- Are you supposed to know this? - How would you know?

1678
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:15,200
- I'm between these two. - This is confusing.

1679
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,930
- I'm between these two. - This is difficult.

1680
01:04:16,930 --> 01:04:18,830
- I remember mine. - I'm between these two.

1681
01:04:18,830 --> 01:04:21,500
I was wearing jeans for sure. The day before,

1682
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:22,830
I slept over at his place.

1683
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:23,830
You wore jeans.

1684
01:04:23,830 --> 01:04:26,300
I slept over at his place and went out for the blind date.

1685
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:28,230
If you slept over, it can't be a white shirt.

1686
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:30,360
- You don't think so? - It would have gotten dirty.

1687
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,430
- I didn't wear black shirts though. - It would have been dirty.

1688
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:33,630
- It's a white shirt. - It is, right?

1689
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:36,800
- It's a white shirt. - It can't be a white shirt.

1690
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,960
(They all sound convincing. What would Seok Jin choose?)

1691
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,700
- I think it's a white shirt. - It's white shirt.

1692
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:43,000
(He chooses jeans, white shirt, and a black cap.)

1693
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:44,560
Are you going with that?

1694
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:45,860
Let's do it.

1695
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:47,600
In 1, 2, 3.

1696
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,800
(Would he establish himself as a true lover?)

1697
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,730
I had no idea.

1698
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:55,830
It looks like you're performing.

1699
01:04:55,830 --> 01:04:57,860
(He gets a sweatshirt.)

1700
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,060
It looks like you're performing.

1701
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:01,400
- It was a black shirt. - It was black.

1702
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:03,830
- It was a black shirt. - Just wear this.

1703
01:05:03,830 --> 01:05:05,160
I should have used the chance card.

1704
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:07,160
- I guess it's a casual wedding. - That's right.

1705
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:08,900
You're so classy.

1706
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:10,560
- My goodness. - This is good.

1707
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:11,730
Do I look all right?

1708
01:05:11,730 --> 01:05:12,900
It's excellent.

1709
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:15,500
- Charming sides are difficult. - This is tough.

1710
01:05:15,530 --> 01:05:17,260
- It's one of these. - It's this one. You're kind.

1711
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:18,860
- It's one of these. - It's this one.

1712
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:20,460
- She likes it when I'm kind. - This should be it.

1713
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:23,060
- The question gave it away. - I'm pretty kind to her.

1714
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:24,160
What's that?

1715
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:25,530
(He chooses his charm as being a kind man.)

1716
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:27,060
"Running Man make-up"?

1717
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,160
- Am I wrong? This is incorrect? - I guess not.

1718
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,030
Maybe it's that he doesn't get mad easily.

1719
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:34,260
- Please. - Don't worry.

1720
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:35,760
Let me go like this.

1721
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:37,000
(They've been married for 19 years and he didn't even know.)

1722
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:40,260
I look like a bully.

1723
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,630
- You look fine. - You look good.

1724
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:44,760
- You look good. - It's great.

1725
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:47,300
- It's actually better this way. - Do this side too.

1726
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:48,360
(This is Seok Jin's type of attire for the wedding.)

1727
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:52,200
(They arrive at the venue at 4:50pm.)

1728
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:55,500
(Soo Jeong awaits her husband.)

1729
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:58,430
My gosh.

1730
01:05:59,430 --> 01:06:00,700
It's a reminder wedding.

1731
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:02,730
Excuse me.

1732
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:04,360
(Where is my lovely bride?)

1733
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,100
It's Soo Jeong.

1734
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:07,360
- Is it really her? - Soo Jeong.

1735
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:09,230
- Oh, dear. - Is it you?

1736
01:06:09,230 --> 01:06:11,530
- Is it the groom's entry? - No, not yet.

1737
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,460
I'm sorry for coming like this.

1738
01:06:14,130 --> 01:06:15,900
You look beautiful, Soo Jeong.

1739
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:18,560
Soo Jeong, it's been a long time.

1740
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,000
- Is it really her? - Hello.

1741
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,360
She looks like Seol Hyun from the back.

1742
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:23,730
(Is it really Seok Jin's wife?)

1743
01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:27,200
(She's the bride, the most special person for today.)

1744
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:30,130
- Hello. - Hello.

1745
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:32,560
Hello, Mrs. Jee.

1746
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:36,030
- Hello. - We're sorry.

1747
01:06:36,530 --> 01:06:39,300
Soo Jeong.

1748
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:41,000
- We're sorry. - She's beautiful.

1749
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,660
- She's so pretty. - Hey.

1750
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:44,260
He got a few questions wrong.

1751
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:45,800
You're still handsome.

1752
01:06:46,430 --> 01:06:48,900
Really?

1753
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:50,260
(She's the bride for sure.)

1754
01:06:51,530 --> 01:06:53,960
(Seok Jin's wedding commences.)

1755
01:06:56,030 --> 01:06:57,400
Look at the audience.

1756
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,560
(They feel nervous as if it was 19 years ago.)

1757
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:03,500
Hello, I'm Yu Jae Seok, the host for today's wedding ceremony.

1758
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:06,060
He's so handsome.

1759
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:08,160
- He's a great host. - He's our friend.

1760
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:11,700
Today's wedding...

1761
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:14,630
is between Seok Jin and Soo Jeong who's been married for 19 years.

1762
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:15,660
It's a valuable time...

1763
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,630
for them to renew their vows.

1764
01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:20,930
Bride and groom.

1765
01:07:22,030 --> 01:07:23,160
Please come in.

1766
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:27,660
You are so pretty.

1767
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:29,060
(They enter with old flower girls.)

1768
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:30,800
(They are blushing.)

1769
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:35,500
The groom seems to be very active.

1770
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:37,900
This is his ceremony to renew his vow.

1771
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:40,200
This is truly touching.

1772
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,860
The groom has starred on "Capture the Moment How is that Possible".

1773
01:07:42,860 --> 01:07:44,460
"Capture the Moment How is that Possible"?

1774
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:48,000
He appeared as a man who's happy all year long.

1775
01:07:48,830 --> 01:07:50,400
Please have a happy life.

1776
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:51,860
Congratulations.

1777
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:52,860
Next,

1778
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:55,500
please bow to each other.

1779
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:58,530
Please give a round of applause.

1780
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,530
- They look great. - It has...

1781
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:05,630
been 19 years since they've been in a wedding hall.

1782
01:08:05,630 --> 01:08:08,260
I imagine that they must be reminded of their memories.

1783
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:11,060
Jee Seok Jin, do you love your wife,

1784
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:13,800
Ryu Soo Jeong, as you did 19 years ago?

1785
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,130
I do!

1786
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:18,260
- My gosh. - He's so cool.

1787
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:21,100
Ryu Soo Jeong,

1788
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:25,800
do you love your husband, Jee Seok Jin, as you did 19 years ago?

1789
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,530
- I do. - All right.

1790
01:08:27,730 --> 01:08:28,860
She's crying.

1791
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:32,200
- Why are you crying? - I hope your love won't change.

1792
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:35,530
- Now, you will exchange the rings. - They have rings?

1793
01:08:36,130 --> 01:08:41,160
The crew has prepared R Rings to commemorate the renewal.

1794
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:44,560
He has never won that before.

1795
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:45,930
Now, he has won it.

1796
01:08:45,930 --> 01:08:48,060
- The ring fits perfectly. - Really?

1797
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:49,730
My wife's ring size is nine.

1798
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:53,260
- I'm about to cry now. - What a good husband.

1799
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:55,030
I'm so moved.

1800
01:08:55,470 --> 01:08:58,360
The bride, Ryu Soo Jeong, has prepared a letter...

1801
01:08:58,470 --> 01:09:01,060
for her husband, Jee Seok Jin.

1802
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:02,730
- Why did you do that? - Why don't you...

1803
01:09:02,730 --> 01:09:04,830
- read it out loud? - This will make people cry.

1804
01:09:05,530 --> 01:09:07,600
Dear my loving husband,

1805
01:09:08,730 --> 01:09:12,000
I met you when I was 24 years old. I was immature, then.

1806
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,730
We gave birth to Hyun Woo. You became Hyun Woo's father.

1807
01:09:15,730 --> 01:09:19,760
It's been 20 years since you've been my husband.

1808
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,760
We used to argue a lot before.

1809
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:27,630
Now, we are too busy to argue. We are busy taking care of each other.

1810
01:09:28,930 --> 01:09:31,630
You protect us from this tough world.

1811
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:33,930
You're always here when I need you.

1812
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:38,060
You are my eternal, best friend who knows me so well.

1813
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:41,000
There is no path to happiness.

1814
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,660
Happiness is the path.

1815
01:09:43,230 --> 01:09:47,260
When we follow the path, just looking forward,

1816
01:09:47,470 --> 01:09:49,860
a happy life will unfold before us.

1817
01:09:50,530 --> 01:09:54,200
Let us keep our lifelong friendship, Honey.

1818
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,660
I love you.

1819
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,500
Please give a round of applause.

1820
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:00,430
(The groom holds back his tears.)

1821
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:01,470
- My gosh. - Goodness.

1822
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:02,760
(What a touching letter.)

1823
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:04,530
Don't cry.

1824
01:10:04,530 --> 01:10:07,500
- He seems a bit overwhelmed. - Yes, he does.

1825
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:09,430
- Seok Jin. - I am overwhelmed a bit.

1826
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:11,830
Next, it's time for the song.

1827
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:13,760
Is this how we should do it? Should we hold hands?

1828
01:10:15,530 --> 01:10:18,060
(They hold each other's hands.)

1829
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:22,430
(They both look the same direction.)

1830
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:23,530
This is nice.

1831
01:10:24,030 --> 01:10:25,600
(She gets teary-eyed.)

1832
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:33,470
(He sings sincerely to wish the best for them.)

1833
01:10:35,830 --> 01:10:37,760
- Why am I crying? - Why is she crying?

1834
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:46,030
(Seok Jin and Soo Jeong survived tiring daily life and hard times...)

1835
01:10:46,030 --> 01:10:50,330
(because they have each other.)

1836
01:10:53,260 --> 01:11:01,200
(They stood by each other's side for 20 years as a friend and a lover.)

1837
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:05,830
(Thank you for always being there.)

1838
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:13,300
(Seok Jin sings seriously and finishes the song.)

1839
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:16,060
(He embraces her.)

1840
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,560
(I'm fortunate that you are with me.)

1841
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,060
Thank you.

1842
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:21,970
(I'm fortunate that you are with me.)

1843
01:11:22,530 --> 01:11:24,530
Congratulations on renewing your vows.

1844
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:27,260
- This is for Soo Jeong. - Okay.

1845
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:31,100
(He changes the lyrics to add her name in.)

1846
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:36,030
(He wittily changes the lyrics so that everyone can sing along.)

1847
01:11:37,730 --> 01:11:40,100
(The groom sings a verse, too.)

1848
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:41,860
(Blushing)

1849
01:11:43,030 --> 01:11:46,560
Thank you very much, Soo Jeong.

1850
01:11:48,030 --> 01:11:52,360
Soo Jeong, it's already been 20 years.

1851
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:56,970
(The professional singer changes the lyrics to sing a romantic serenade.)

1852
01:11:56,970 --> 01:11:58,300
Give a round of applause.

1853
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:01,360
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

1854
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:02,730
It was my honor.

1855
01:12:02,930 --> 01:12:04,470
- Thank you. - I knew it.

1856
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:06,630
He improvised.

1857
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:09,100
- Shouldn't we ask them to kiss? - We should.

1858
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:11,060
- Kiss her. - Give her a kiss.

1859
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:13,130
- Please give her a kiss. - Kiss her.

1860
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:15,970
Why don't we let them do it?

1861
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:17,730
- She looks so pretty. - My goodness.

1862
01:12:17,730 --> 01:12:19,560
Please clap when they kiss.

1863
01:12:19,730 --> 01:12:20,800
To both of you,

1864
01:12:20,930 --> 01:12:22,300
we wish a happy life.

1865
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:25,430
(We took care of each other with undying love for 20 years.)

1866
01:12:25,430 --> 01:12:27,360
(Let's only walk on flowery roads.)

1867
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:31,160
Thank you for being with me. You are my rock.

1868
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:35,660
I hope we can lead a happy and healthy life without getting old.

1869
01:12:36,030 --> 01:12:37,470
I love you, Honey.

1870
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:43,970
(Seok Jin's week is a success. Seok Jin and Soo Jeong, always be happy.)

1871
01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:46,400
(Ultimate Battle of Supernaturals)

1872

(This battle will determine the members' fates.)

1880
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:03,160
(Is there a mysterious person behind this battle?)

1881
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,500
(Who will be the winner of this shocking and terrifying battle?)

1882

(Next week, Ultimate Battle of Supernaturals)
