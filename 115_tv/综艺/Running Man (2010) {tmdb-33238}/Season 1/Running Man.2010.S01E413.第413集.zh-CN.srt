00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,300
<i>孩子们 在我大学二年级时</i>
<i>Kids, sophomore year of college,</i>

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,300
<i>Lily阿姨刚放完春假回来</i>
<i>when Lily came back from spring break,</i>

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,500
<i>Marshall叔叔在机场给了她个惊喜</i>
<i>Marshall surprised her at the airport.</i>

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,900
<i>而她也用一箱六支装本地产啤酒 给了他惊喜</i>
<i>And she surprised him with a six-pack of locally brewed beer.</i>

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,100
_德岱堡! 明白?
Fort Lau-ger-Dale! Get it?

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,800
<i>随之产生了一项传统</i>
<i>And with that, a ritual was born.</i>

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,500
<i>接下来的11年里 他俩无论何时</i>
<i>For the next 11 years, whenever either of them would fly anywhere...</i>

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,800
<i>飞往何处...</i> - Minne-Cider
Minne-Cider!

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,800
了解?
Get it?

10
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,000
<i>重逢的庆祝总是伴随着</i>
<i>... the reunion was always commemorated with a chauffeur sign</i>

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
<i>一个司机手势和一箱带回来的 六支装当地啤酒</i>
<i>and a six-pack from wherever they'd been.</i>

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,200
Aspen Yards Ale!
Aspen Yards Ale!

13
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,600
收到?
- Get it? - Actually, no.

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,900
其实 没有
Me, neither. I was hoping you would.

15
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,800
我也是 我还以为你会懂

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,000
<i>但是在2009年一月的一晚</i>
<i>But, one night in January of 2009, the unthinkable happened.</i>

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,300
<i>难以想象的事情发生了</i>
- I'm not picking her up. - What?

18
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,100
- 我不去接她 - 什么?

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,200
Lily不想我搭出租一路赶去机场
Lily doesn't want me taking a cab all the way to the airport

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,800
只是为了再搭一辆回来 明白吧?
just to take a cab all the way back, you know?

21
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,200
但六支装当地啤酒呢?
But the six-pack thing.

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,400
Ted... 年轻时那算是情趣
That stuff was fun when we were younger, but we've grown past that.

23
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,700
但我们都过了那个年纪了

24
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,000
我们的感情也随着我们成熟起来了
As we mature, the relationship matures with us.

25
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,200
但是... 我是说 你们俩对我们这些人
But... you guys are such an inspiration to the rest of us,

26
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,300
是很大的激励  你们这么恩爱跟亲密
how you're so devoted and connected.

27
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,600
我看着你们
I look at you guys, and that's all I want in the whole world.

28
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,800
觉得那就是世界上我想要的全部了

29
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,400
Ted 外面有两个女大学生 看上去挺好泡的!
Ted, there's two college girls outside, and they look easy!

30
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,100
那么 亚利桑那州
Arizona, you know,

31
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,600
我- 我一直想瞧瞧
I've always wanted to see what an Arizona driver's license looks like.

32
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,300
亚利桑那州驾驶执照长啥样

33
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,700
这招我刚才已经用过了 兄弟 她们21岁啦
I already ran that play. They're 21.

34
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,000
- 明白啦 - 老天爷 嗯 那你们来镇上是干嘛?
We're good. Thank God. So, what brings you guys to town?

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,400
我们乐队有个演出机会
- Our band's got a gig. - Oh, you're in a band?

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,500
噢 你们参加了乐队?

37
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,200
- 嘿 或许我们可以去看你们表演 - 失陪一下
- Maybe we'll come see you play. - Excuse us for a sec.

38
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,100
Ted 你到底怎么回事?
What is the matter with you?

39
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,500
- 我们不会去看她们的演出 - 为什么不去?
- We're not gonna go see them play. - Why not?

40
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,900
要是我们去看她们演出
If we see them play, we're no better

41
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,300
那我们就像是那些Van Halen音乐会上
than the bleach-blonde bimbos who flash their boobs at a Van Halen concert.

42
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,700
蠢到冒泡的胸大无脑的金发妞

43
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,500
是啊 但那些小妞在演出后不是
But don't those girls get to have sex with Van Halen after the show?

44
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,200
跟Van Halen上床了吗?

45
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,500
你要是想和Van Halen上床
If you want to have sex with Van Halen, do it on your own time.

46
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,100
那就别在工作时间里 Ted

47
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,100
我们不是那种
We are not the maybe-we-can-come- see-you-play guys.

48
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,000
"或许我们能去看表演"的家伙

49
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,300
我们是另外的 更成熟的男人
We're the other guys, the older guys who never showed up

50
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,000
从不现身 总是被人们所热切追求
and whose approval they now crave.

51
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,000
那我们算是她们的老爸了?
- So we're their dads? - Exactly.

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
正是

53
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,400
好吧

54
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,000
有个重要的会议
It's a big meeting, so I don't think we're gonna make it.

55
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,800
所以我们去不了了

56
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,100
或许下次吧 姐们
Maybe next time, kiddos.

57
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,300
但要是你们想在演出之后见面
If you want to meet us after your show, maybe we could exchange numbers.

58
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,400
- 或许我们能交换电话号码... - 失陪一下
Excuse us for a minute.

59
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,900
Ted 你脑子进水了啊?
Ted, have you gone completely insane? We don't want their phone numbers.

60
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,800
我们不想要她们的电话号码

61
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,100
是 我不知道我在做什么
I don't know what I was doing. I guess I panicked out there.

62
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,400
我想我在外面那儿有点慌张

63
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,600
当你跟一个小妞交换号码时
When you exchange numbers with a chick,

64
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,400
她们可以拨打或是直接删掉
you give them the ability to call and cancel.

65
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,100
你要是定个约会 不用号码
If you set a date without a number, they have to show up.

66
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,700
她们就必须出现了

67
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,300
见面 嘿咻!
Check and mate!

68
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,900
我唯一需要的"数字"(也指"手指") 就是这些
The only digits I need are these.

69
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,200
哦呵
Honka.

70
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,200
你还是他们的老爸吗?
Are you still their dad?

71
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,500
我们不如明晚10点在这见吧
So, why don't we just meet here tomorrow night around 10:00.

72
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,300
我想得看雪下得怎样
I think it's supposed to snow.

73
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,300
要是有暴风雪我们怎么办?
- What do we do if there's a blizzard? - Either way, we'll be here.

74
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,000
不管怎样 我们都会到的

75
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,600
下雪问题
"Snow" problem.

76
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,800
最后再失陪一会
Excuse us just one last second.

77
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,300
现在又是怎么回事?!
What is the problem now?

78
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,300
干得好
- Nice one. - Thanks.

79
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,400
好的 明晚见
- We'll see you tomorrow night. - Totally. Awesome!

80
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,000
- 一定到 - 好极了!

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,600
"一定到 好极了!"
"Totally. Awesome!"

82
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
老兄 那些大学小妞感觉挺蠢
Man, these college chicks sound stupid.

83
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
一定到 好极了
- Totally. - Awesome. So, here's the thing:

84
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,300
现在的情况: 明晚
tomorrow night, dress to move; it's gonna be a mess!

85
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,600
穿衣打扮 到时候一定轰轰烈烈

86
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,900
我还是觉得我们应该拿到她们的号码
I still think we should've gotten their numbers.

87
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,000
你老是杞人忧天
You always assume something is gonna go wrong.

88
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,300
Ted 我向你保证 绝不会出什么岔子
Ted, I promise you, nothing is gonna go wrong.

89
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,300
嘿 开始下雪了
It's starting to snow.

93
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,100
<i>孩子 09年的暴风雪狂暴无比</i>
<i>Kids, the blizzard of '09 was a monster.</i>

94
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,900
<i>雪一直下了三天</i>
<i>It snowed for three days straight,</i>

95
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,200
<i>也带来了三个难忘的故事</i>
<i>which led to three amazing stories.</i>

96
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,700
<i>我从Barney跟我的故事讲起</i>
<i>I'll start with me and Barney.</i>

97
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,300
外面环境糟透了
It's pretty nasty out there. I don't think they're coming.

98
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,500
我想她们不会来了
Of course they're coming. They have to.

99
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,600
她们当然会来了 那是必须的

100
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,200
要是我能把到其中一个妹
If I can land just one of these girls, I'll have party school bingo.

101
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,900
我可就中了玩乐学校的大奖啦

102
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,900
拜托 Ted 这儿只有你一个人
Come on, Ted. You're the only one here.

103
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,500
哦 不好意思 什么是玩乐学校大奖?
Sorry. What's party school bingo?

104
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,800
每一年"花花公子"都会列出一个
Every year, Playboy releases a list of the top party schools in the country.

105
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,600
全国最顶尖的玩乐学校的名单

106
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,200
我选了前25名 然后做了个...
I take the top 25, and I make up...

107
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,000
大奖卡片
a bingo card.

108
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,700
我需要亚利桑那科技大学
All I need is Arizona Tech,

109
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,100
狂热的地方
which is crazy.

110
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,600
在联盟赛里 通常会有
In league play, that would normally be designated a free space.

111
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,200
指定的自由空间

112
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,900
那么 在你那个玩乐学校大奖里
So, how many people are in on this party school bingo thing?

113
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,200
有多少个人?

114
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,400
哦 就我一个
It's just me.

115
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,100
那这些事都有什么意义?
So what's the point, then?

116
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,700
意义在于我连续搞定5个
The point is to get five in a row.

117
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,400
在那之后呢?
And what do you get when you get five in a row?

118
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
我就中大奖啦
I get bingo.

119
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,400
多谢你能过来
Thanks for coming by.

120
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,100
我在这恒温器上花了一个小时
I monkeyed around with the thermostat for about an hour

121
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,000
然后才发现它是内部通话系统
before I realized it was the intercom.

122
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,100
我在楼下听到你的骂声了
I heard you swearing downstairs.

123
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,100
嘿 那么
So, Lily's flight's coming in tonight, you're really not gonna go pick her up?

124
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,300
Lily的班机今晚就到了

125
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,000
你真不打算去接她吗?

126
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,800
Robin Robin 就像我说过的

127
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,400
我们的感情随着我们成熟起来了
Like I said,

128
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:11,101
as we mature, our relationship matures with us.

129
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,300
是啊 我了解你妻子
Yeah, if I know your wife,

130
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,200
她还是会给你带六支装啤酒的
she's gonna get you that six-pack anyway.

131
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,700
Marshall?

132
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,900
Marshall?

133
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,000
Puget Stout
Puget Stout.

134
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,500
西雅图最可口的啤酒
A most exquisite Seattle microbrew.

135
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,700
说到六...
And speaking of six-packs...

136
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,400
噢...

137
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:36,700
你要干嘛?
- What are you doing? - I'm going to the airport.

138
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,500
我要去机场

139
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,800
我怎么会这么蠢?!
How could I be so stupid? Of course she's bringing me a six-pack!

140
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,700
她当然会给我带六支装啤酒了!

141
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,700
但这次 我没有给他带六支装啤酒
But this time, I didn't bring him a six-pack.

142
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,500
因为...
Because... as we mature,

143
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,400
我们的感情随着我们成熟起来了

144
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,118
the relationship matures with us.

145
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,400
听上去他是个不错的年轻人
He sounds like a nice young man.

146
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,100
我猜他一定还是会给你个惊喜 会来接你的机
I'll bet he surprises you and picks you up anyway.

147
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,800
- 噢 宝贝! - 喔 喔

148
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,900
喔 喔 喔

149
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,100
我的啤酒呢?
- Where's my beer? - We said we weren't gonna.

150
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,100
我们说好不再搞这些的

151
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,600
- 我这儿有啤酒 - 哇哦
I have beer.

152
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,100
是六支装的 而且你的身高跟我正合适
A six-pack and you're an appropriate height for me.

153
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,600
出发 新Lily
Let's go, New Lily.

154
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,300
哦 我得弄点啤酒来
- Man, I got to get some beer. - <i>Folks, this is your captain speaking.</i>

155
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,000
乘客们 我是本机的机长

156
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,900
我们即将提前一小时
<i>Looks like we're going to be arriving an hour early.</i>

157
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,800
到达

158
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,600
太好啦! 呜呼!

159
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,700
赶紧喝完 伙计 我要关门了
Drink up, boys. I'm closing the bar.

160
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,500
不要啊! 才刚9点而已
- It's only 9:00. - And this place is ragin', yo!

161
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,200
这里气氛正热烈着呢

162
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,500
伙计 非常抱歉 但我得去弄
Guys, I'm really sorry, but I got to go set up cots in the church basement.

163
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,300
教堂地下室的帆布床了
It doubles as a shelter on snowy nights like this.

164
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,500
在这样的雪夜里它就是个避难所了

165
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,900
你这个自私的混蛋!
You selfish bastard!

166
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,600
有两位辣妹正来这儿见我们
There are two very hot girls coming here to meet us.

167
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,400
你就不能迟点再关门吗?
Can't you leave open a little while longer?

168
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,800
我们会看着一切的
- We'll keep an eye on everything. - You two? No way.

169
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,100
你们俩? 算了吧
You wouldn't know the first thing about running a bar.

170
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,000
你们连经营一家酒吧最重要的事 都不知道

171
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,400
先为辣妹服务?
Serve the hotties first?

172
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,500
钥匙在这里
Here's the keys.

173
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,300
钥匙在这里
Here's the keys.

174
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,300
那些女孩一到
As soon as your girls show up, you turn off the lights and you lock up.

175
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,200
你们就得关灯锁门

176
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,800
我不想回来看到这里一片狼藉
I don't want to come back and find this place trashed.

177
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,100
哇 你说真的?
- Seriously? - I can trust you guys.

178
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,200
我信任你们俩
<i>To understand what it meant to us to get the keys to MacLaren's, </i>

179
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,200
<i>为了让你们了解能得到Maclaren的钥匙</i>

180
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,400
<i>对我们意味着什么 让我们回到几年前</i>
<i>I have to take you back a few years</i>

181
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,700
<i>那个我说了五个单词的晚上</i>
<i>to the night that I uttered five little words</i>

182
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,400
<i>那是每个男人在他生命某个时刻 都会说的</i>
<i>that every man at some point in his life will say.</i>

183
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,800
咱该开酒吧
- We should buy a bar. - Of course, we should buy a bar!

184
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,200
当然 我们应该买一家酒吧!

185
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,900
我们就是应该买一家酒吧
We should totally buy a bar.

186
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,400
我们就是应该买一家酒吧
- We should totally buy a bar. - Our bar would be awesome.

187
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,000
我们的酒吧一定棒极了

188
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,700
老兄 老兄
And dude, dude, dude,

189
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,300
老兄 老兄...

190
00:07:29,245 --> 00:07:30,346
dude...

191
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,900
我们酒吧的名字...
the name of our bar...

192
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,000
谜题
Puzzles.

193
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,700
人们不禁会想
People will be like, "Why is it called Puzzles?"

194
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,900
"为什么叫做谜题?"

195
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,900
那就是个谜
That's the puzzle.

196
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,300
那是...
That is...

197
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,100
一个绝妙的酒吧名字!
a great name for a bar!

198
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,200
而且
And also, at Puzzles:

199
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,000
在谜题: 不会催赶客人
no last call.

200
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,100
不会赶客人!
No last call!

201
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,200
只有当每个人都喝完了
Only when every single person is finished having the greatest night

202
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,100
度过了一个人生中最美妙的夜晚
of his or her life do we stack the chairs on the table

203
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,700
我们才开始收拾桌椅

204
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,100
关掉三层的玛格丽塔酒瀑布
and power down the three-story margarita waterfall.

205
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,900
我们应该买一家酒吧
- We should buy a bar. - We should buy a bar.

206
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,500
<i>就像每个男人都会说的</i>
<i>Like the other ill-advised five-word sentences </i>

207
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,700
<i>另外的五字蠢话...</i>
<i>every man eventually says in his life...</i>

208
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,700
我能跳过去
I can jump that far.

209
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,200
把她抢回来
I'm gonna win her back.

210
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,900
我信任你们俩
I can trust you guys.

211
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,800
<i>我们早晚会后悔的</i>
<i>... we would come to regret it. We just didn't know it yet.</i>

212
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,300
<i>只是当时不知道</i>

213
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,300
你有货?
You have it? Awesome! I'll be right there.

214
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,800
太棒了 我马上就到

215
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,700
Ranjit!

216
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,000
你好
I'm Rachel Sondheimer.

217
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,600
我是Rachel Sondheimer

218
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,400
等一分钟 Lily
Wait a minute, Lily.

219
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,100
如果你刚下飞机 那Marshall在哪儿?
If you are getting off the plane, where is Marshall?

220
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,700
还有你的六瓶装呢?
- And where is your six-pack? - That's the problem.

221
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,400
那就是问题所在
I have to get to Brewniverse in East Meadow in an hour.

222
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,800
我得在一小时内

223
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,700
赶到东梅多的Brewniverse

224
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,400
跟我上车吧!
- To the Town Car! - Thank you.

225
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,700
哦 谢谢!

226
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,800
哦 酒保
Barkeep. Triple Sec.

227
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,300
橙味利口酒 (triple sec:"三重蒸馏" 代表橙味利口酒)
Coming right up, tap-minder.

228
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,900
立刻就来 伙计

229
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,900
哈 哈 噢 嘿!

230
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,400
我们再买一个
We'll get one.

231
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,800
上酒
- Order up. - Order up.

232
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,100
我们再买一个
We'll get one.

233
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,700
谢天谢地 你们还在这儿
Thank God you're still here.

234
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,500
不知道你们有没有
I don't know if you guys have ever seen <i>Star Wars</i>, but it's like Hoth out there.

235
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,400
看过星球大战 但外面就象霍斯星球 (Hoth:星战中被冰层覆盖的行星)

236
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,300
- 这个我要 - 让我想起
Dibs.

237
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,100
我常和老爹滑雪橇...
It reminds me of when I used to go sledding with my dad...

238
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,900
在他去世之前
before he left.

239
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,100
这个是我的
And dibs.

240
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
那 来杯酒暖暖身 怎么样?
So, can we warm you up with a drink?

241
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,100
当然... 顺便说一下 我邀请了
Sure... by the way, I invited the rest of the band to come and meet us.

242
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,600
乐队其他人来这和我们碰头

243
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,000
我们希望能喝醉
We were hoping to get drunk. I mean really drunk.

244
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,500
我是说酩酊大醉

245
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,200
像我老爹过去那样
Like my dad used to.

246
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,200
别跟我抢 别跟我抢
Dibsity, dibsity, dibsity.

247
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:51,800
我想我们能
I guess we could keep the place open a little bit longer.

248
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,400
迟一点再关门

249
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,200
只要就你们和乐队
As long as it's just you and the band.

250
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,100
Melissa
Melissa, what kind of band is this?

251
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,100
你们是什么乐队?

252
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,100
哦 我们是亚利桑那打击科技母鸡行进乐队
We're the Arizona Tech Fighting Hens Marching Band.

253
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,700
母鸡向前冲!
Go, Hens!

254
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,600
<i>于是 我和你们的Barney叔叔</i>
<i>And then, your Uncle Barney and I had one of our telepathic conversations.</i>

255
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,100
<i>展开了一次心电感应对话</i>

256
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,300
<i>伙计 Carl会剁了我们</i>
<i>Dude, Carl's gonna kill us</i>

257
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,600
<i>如果我们不赶紧把所有人都踢出去的话</i>
<i>if we don't kick everyone out of here right now.</i>

258
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,000
<i>Barney 我是认真的</i>
<i>Barney, I'm serious. We promised we wouldn't mess the place up.</i>

259
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,700
<i>我们保证过不会 把这里弄得乱七八糟</i>

260
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,000
<i>好吧 你说的也对</i>
<i>All right, I guess you have a point.</i>

261
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,700
酒吧继续营业!
The bar is open!

262
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,100
谁要啤酒?
Who wants a beer?

263
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,600
我还是会说这很蠢
I still say this is stupid.

264
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,500
"我们的感情随着我们成熟起来了"
What happened to, "As we mature, the relationship matures with us"?

265
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,500
怎么回事?

266
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,000
那是Lily在"今日心理"上看到的
That's just something Lily read in Psychology Today.

267
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,700
好啦 是在"时尚"上看到的
All right, she read it in Cosmo.

268
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,800
好啦 是我在"时尚"上看到的
All right, I read it in Cosmo.

269
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,500
好啦好啦 是"娇点" (针对年轻女孩子的版本)
All right, it was Cosmo Girl. Just drive, okay.

270
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,700
你就管开车 行吧

271
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,700
我只是不懂一个小惯例
I don't get why it's such a big deal

272
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,900
被搁在一旁有什么大不了的
that one little ritual goes by the wayside.

273
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,700
不只是这样 懂吗?
It's not just this, okay? It's all our little rituals.

274
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,600
是我们所有的小习惯

275
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,400
你知道以前每天我一回家 我们都要做什么吗?
Do you know what we used to do every day the second I got home?

276
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,400
老兄 我可不想听你们 那疯狂的猴子激情
Man, I don't want to hear about your crazy monkey sex.

277
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,300
我们会告诉对方当天吃过的东西
We would tell each other what we had to eat that day.

278
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,900
两个鸡蛋 一片奶酪批萨
Two eggs, a slice of cheese pizza

279
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,500
还有一些水煮蔬菜
and some steamed veggies.

280
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,600
综合贝果 鸡胸肉
Everything bagel, chicken breast,

281
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,100
一些西芹棒 和一勺花生酱
some celery sticks and a spoon of peanut butter.

282
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,800
疯狂的猴子激情?
- Crazy monkey sex? - Crazy monkey sex.

283
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,000
疯狂的猴子激情

284
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,900
噢 Lily TMI

285
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,700
信息过多
TMI...

286
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,543
too many informations.

287
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,700
你知道我还怀念什么吗?
You know what else I miss?

288
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,800
我们的午餐电话
Our lunchtime phone call.

289
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,900
嘿 宝贝 午餐时间了 我爱你
Baby, it's lunchtime, and I love you.

290
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
原则上我应该与你交换
I reciprocate in principle.

291
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,100
尽管伴随诉讼的中止
Although with the caveat that there seems

292
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,200
貌似在我这有稍许剩余
to be a bit of a surplus here on my end.

293
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,400
不 我更爱你
No, I love you more.

294
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,700
我们需要找个房间
Do we need to get in a room together and bang this thing out?

295
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,400
迅速解决这事吗?

296
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,900
所开出的条件听上去很合我意
Those sound like agreeable terms,

297
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,300
尽管我可能得
although I may need adjust my briefs.

298
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,900
调整我的案情提要

299
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,200
我也爱你
Love you, too.

300
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,600
但今天当她打过来
But today when she called,

301
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,400
我由着它转接到语音信箱 语音信箱!
I let it go to voice mail. Voice mail!

302
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,800
你怎么能?!
How could you?!

303
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,007
我最怀念的是
The thing I miss most is kissing at midnight on New Year's Eve.

304
00:12:18,057 --> 00:12:20,200
除夕子夜的那一吻

305
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,500
那可是新年传统
It was a New Year's tradition.

306
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,500
但你知道今年我们干了什么吗?
But you know what we did this year?

307
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,500
- 疯狂的猴子激情? - 才不是
- Crazy monkey sex? - No.

308
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,700
- 好了 所有这些看似可爱的小习惯 - 确实...
Okay, all these cute, adorable little rituals... They're stupid.

309
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,000
它们都很无聊
Telling each other what you had to eat? You're like children playing house.

310
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,800
告诉彼此吃过些什么?

311
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,400
你们就像两个孩子扮家家酒

312
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,500
唔... 可能你觉得它们无聊
Maybe you just think they're stupid because you've never been

313
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,500
那是因为你从没和某人交往
in a relationship long enough to develop them.

314
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,000
久到养成这些习惯

315
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,800
什么?!
- What? - You don't understand love.

316
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,400
你不懂什么是爱

317
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,900
好吧 你就像机器人
Okay, you're like some robot who sees a person crying and says...

318
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,200
看到有人哭就说...

319
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,700
"为什么这个人类在漏水?"
"Why is that human leaking?"

320
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,300
- 就是那样吗? - 没错
Is that right?

321
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:57,600
那...
Well, then... Robot initiating pull-over-to-the- side-of-the-road-

322
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,900
启动机器人程序

323
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,400
把车开到路边
until-jackass-apologizes- to-me sequence.

324
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,300
直到混蛋向我道歉

325
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,200
我的机器人程序要好上几千几万倍
My robot was like, a million times better.

326
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,300
嘿 就跟你说一声
So you know, the trough in the bathroom is overflowing.

327
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,200
厕所的水槽满得溢出来了

328
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,000
厕所没水槽
There's no trough in the bathroom.

329
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,600
你刚从厨房出来
And you just came out of the kitchen.

330
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Ted 奎宁杜松子酒怎么调!
What's in a gin and tonic? What's in a gin and tonic?

331
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,200
奎宁杜松子酒该怎么调?!

332
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,300
好啦 开酒吧太逊了
Running a bar sucks. Let's just close up.

333
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,200
我们关门吧

334
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,400
不! 不!
There's no last call.

335
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,000
不要搞什么最后招待

336
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,800
迷情酒吧 这是Barney
Puzzles, go for Barney.

337
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
还好 你还在那 我五分钟就到
Good. You're still there. I'll be there in five.

338
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,800
最后招待
Last call.

339
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,100
Robin 来了辆除雪机
There's a snowplow coming. We have to get back on the road.

340
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,200
我们得回到路上
You think the only way to be in love is to have pet names.

341
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,300
你以为爱情唯一的方式就是喊出些爱称

342
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,500
或给对方留些愚蠢的小字条
Or leave each other stupid, little notes

343
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,100
或毫无缘由地驾车
or go charging off into a blizzard for no good reason.

344
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,200
冲进暴风雪中
Do you understand what's going to happen?

345
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,800
说真的 你明白

346
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,100
除雪机经过会发生什么吗?
You know what you are? You're a love snob.

347
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,300
你知道你是什么吗? 你是个爱情势利鬼

348
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,800
两人交往有很多方式
There's lots of ways to be in a relationship,

349
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,800
你不会懂的
you would know that if you ever left your little love snob country club.

350
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,000
除非你摆脱爱情势利乡村俱乐部

351
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,500
我们要被雪埋了
We're going to get buried by snow. That's going to happen.

352
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,700
逃不掉了
No, screw this. I'm not going to sit here and be insulted.

353
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,800
不 去你的吧

354
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,100
我不会干坐在这里被你羞辱

355
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,300
我们不去机场 我们回家
We're not going to the airport. We're going home.

356
00:14:21,466 --> 00:14:22,713
这是怎么了
What just happened?

357
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,800
嘿 嘿 嗨!
We called earlier about the Seattle microbrew.

358
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,200
先前我们电话问过西雅图本土品牌啤酒

359
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,400
哦 对 还好你打了电话
Good thing you called when you did. I was getting ready to close up.

360
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,300
那会 我准备要关门了

361
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,300
外头可是下着世纪之雪
Storm of the century out there.

362
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,900
当然 现在只是09年 所以说是世纪之雪
Of course, it's only '09, so storm of the century might be

363
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,500
可能有点过了
a little bit premature.

364
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,500
还是说年度之雪吧
Let's say storm of the year.

365
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,400
但现在只是一月份
Although, it is only January.

366
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,000
我们很急 我们现在就得拿走啤酒
We're in kind of a hurry, so, we'll take the beer now.

367
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,100
你们真是可爱的一对
You are a cute couple.

368
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,500
- 谢谢 - 我们不是一对
- Thank you. - We're not a couple.

369
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,500
谢天谢地 要不然太诡异了
Thank God. That would be weird.

370
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:57,800
那...

371
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,700
她来了
Here she is.

372
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,300
"超音速奎宁"
"Supersonic Tonic."

373
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,600
不 这是个桶
No. This is a keg. I need a six-pack.

374
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,000
我要六连装
- A keg's all I got. - We'll take the keg.

375
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,900
我只有这个桶

376
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,000
那我们就拿这个
What? Oh, no. Last time I had one of these in the car,

377
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,500
什么? 噢 不

378
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,300
上次我车里载这个

379
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,800
我最后不得不用油灰刀把座位上
I wound up chipping dried vomit off the seat

380
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,900
干掉的呕吐物刮掉
with a putty knife.

381
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,300
抱歉 Ranjit 但这是我们的惯例
I'm sorry, Ranjit, but this is a ritual

382
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,400
我要把这桶啤酒带给他
and I am bringing him this beer.

383
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,100
你能不能帮我搬进车里
If you could just put it in the car.

384
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,800
我给你50块
I'll give you 50 bucks.

385
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,300
跟我上车吧!
To the Town Car.

386
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,700
Robin 我很抱歉
Robin, I'm sorry. You're not a robot.

387
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,500
你不是机器人

388
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,100
就算你是 你也是
If you are, you're, like, an incredibly advanced model,

389
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,700
非常先进的型号

390
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,500
人类根本没机会
and the human race doesn't stand a chance.

391
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,300
你只是不在俗套的惯例中
You just don't choose to show your love

392
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,300
展现你的爱 那没关系
through corny rituals, and that's fine.

393
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,500
但可能我和Lily这么做
But maybe the reason Lily and I do is because we always have,

394
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,600
是因为我们一直这么做
and we don't know any other way.

395
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,600
我们也不知道其他方式

396
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,100
我清楚地知道一件事 那就是
One thing I do know is that

397
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,400
如果她独自坐在机场
if she's there sitting at the airport alone,

398
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,200
我必须得去接她
I have to go get her.

399
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,000
这些是我们的原则
Those are the rules.

400
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,800
Marshall 闭上眼睛
Marshall, close your eyes.

401
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,200
我不懂你怎么会
I don't know how you heard any of that as me hitting on you, but...

402
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,200
以为我在和你调情 但...

403
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,500
照做吧
Just do it.

404
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,300
现在我们去接你的女人
Now let's go get your woman.

405
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,700
好嘞 走吧
All right, come on.

406
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,800
你们不一定要回家 但不能呆在这儿
You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here.

407
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,400
我总巴望着这么说话
I've always wanted to say that.

408
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,700
我是说 在酒吧里
I mean, in a bar. I say it all the time at home.

409
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,100
我在家一直这么说

410
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,200
伙计 哪天我们应该买个酒吧
Dude, someday we should buy a bar.

411
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
等我们买了
And when we do, we are never going to have last call.

412
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,200
我们决不赶客人走

413
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,100
想想 Barney
Come on, Barney. We said no last call. We've got to mean it.

414
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,800
我们说过不会有最后招待

415
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,300
我们得说话算话
Well, what are we supposed to do? Carl's going to be here any minute.

416
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,800
那 我们该怎么做?

417
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,400
Carl随时会回来的

418
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,500
我们能做的只有一件事
Only one thing we can do.

419
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,000
伙计 开酒吧实在麻烦
Dude, running a bar is a pain in the ass.

420
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,700
我们应该在自己的圈子里闯荡
We should just stick with what we know.

421
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,500
我们该组个乐队
- We should start a band. - Of course we should start a band!

422
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,000
我们当然该组个乐队!

423
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,200
我们之前怎么都没组乐队?
How have we not started a band yet?

424
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,900
<i>孩子们 有时生活</i>
<i>Kids, sometimes in life the planets align,</i>

425
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,600
<i>就像连成线的行星 凡事排成排 </i>
<i>everything links up,</i>

426
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,000
<i>而你会遇到最完美的时机</i>
<i>and your timing is perfect.</i>

427
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,200
Marshall?

428
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,500
Lily?!

429
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,200
Marshall?

430
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,900
Lily?

431
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,600
<i>这一刻并非如此</i>
<i>This wasn't one of those times.</i>

432
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,200
她在哪儿?
Where is she?

433
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,800
西雅图
Seattle.

434
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,800
- 什么? - 她的航班被取消了
- What? - Her flight's canceled.

435
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,100
根本没起飞
It never took off.

436
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,500
不 不 那样她会打给我...
She would've called me and...

437
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,600
嘿 宝贝 是我
Baby, it's me.

438
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,400
我的航班因为什么暴风雪被取消
My flight's been canceled because of some snowstorm

439
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,700
我得到周四才能再订到票
and they couldn't rebook me till Thursday,

440
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,300
所以我得在这再呆两天
<i>so I'm stuck here for another two days.</i>

441
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,600
但这是午餐时间 我爱你
<i>But it's lunchtime, and I love you.</i>

442
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,700
<i>就像我说的 暴风雪持续了三天</i>
<i>Like I said, this was a three-day storm.</i>

443
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:12,700
周二 
- <i>Tuesday.</i> - I still say this is stupid.

444
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,500
我还是会说这很蠢

445
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,500
周三
Wednesday.

446
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:18,567
周四 
- <i>And Thursday.</i> - ... microbrew.

447
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,500
先前打电话问过西雅图本土品牌啤酒

448
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,000
<i>所以当Marshall周二听到那则留言...</i>
<i>So on Tuesday when Marshall heard that message...</i>

449
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
她得到周四才回来
She's not coming in till Thursday.

450
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,000
我是说 我们
I mean, we came all the way down here, and she's not coming in till Thursday.

451
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,700
花大力气来这里

452
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,600
而她得到周四才回来

453
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,200
我觉得我好蠢
I feel so stupid.

454
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:30,900
你瞧 我们...
Look, let's just, let's not tell Lily about any of this, okay?

455
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,300
别把这事告诉Lily 好吗?

456
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,800
尤其是你和我调情那段
Especially the part about you hitting on me.

457
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,300
我没和你调情
I didn't hit on you.

458
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,000
一点没错
Exactly.

459
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,600
<i>然后在周三... 噢 老兄</i>
<i>Then on Wednesday...</i>

460
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,600
我不敢相信你刚开车兜了个大圈
Man, I can't believe you drove all the way out there.

461
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,700
现在你又准备
Now you're gonna turn around and drive all the way out there again tomorrow.

462
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,500
明天再花力气开过去

463
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,500
不是的 这整件事是个征兆 你知道吗?

464
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,300
是时候让惯例休息了
This whole thing was a sign, you know? It's time to put that old ritual to bed.

465
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,800
我不打算去接她
I'm not going to pick her up.

466
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,800
Robin真的勾引你了?
Robin really hit on you?

467
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,100
伙计 感觉怪怪的
Dude,

468
00:18:57,835 --> 00:18:58,762
it was weird.

469
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,800
兄弟们 这个派对赞啊!
Bros,

470
00:19:00,686 --> 00:19:02,766

471

你是我们打击母鸡的真朋友
You are true friends of the Fighting Hens.

472
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,700
如果需要什么
If you ever need anything, don't hesitate to ask.

473
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,300
尽管张口 别客气

474
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,900
吹长笛的有男朋友吗
Is the flute section seeing anyone?

475
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,000
那 等等 你真的不去接她?
So, wait, you're really not going to pick her up?

476
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,900
是 真的啊
- Really. - So the New Year's kiss,

477
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,500
那除夕之吻

478
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,400
午餐电话
the lunchtime phone calls, the whole

479
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,300
还有"说说今天吃过什么"
"this is what I ate today" thing, you're really letting it all go?

480
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,900
你 这一切你真的就这么算了?

481
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,900
真的算了
I really am.

482
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,600
<i>接着 我们来到了周四</i>
<i>Which brings us to Thursday.</i>

483
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,500
一个松饼 一个熏牛肉三明治 一包薯片
A muffin, a pastrami sandwich,

484
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,500
我知道早过了午餐时间 但我爱你
and a bag of chips.

485
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:18,466
And I know it's way past lunchtime, but I love you.

每天都越爱越多
More and more each day, I love you, Lily.

新年快乐
Happy New Year.

00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,500
等一下 这是不是意味着
Wait, does this mean that I have to bring a marching band to the airport

490
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,000
从今以后我得

491
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,800
- 带支行进乐队来机场? - 当然啦
- from now on? - Absolutely.

492
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,800
完蛋了
Crap.

493
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:48,584
Go, Hens!
