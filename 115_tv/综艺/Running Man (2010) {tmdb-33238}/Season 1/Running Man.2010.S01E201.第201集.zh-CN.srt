You all right?

158
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:17,237
发生什么了
What happened?

159
00:12:19,006 --> 00:12:21,441
海德里希在他该在的地方  监狱里  
Heydrich's in prison, where he belongs.

160
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,645
他会被审问
He'll be questioned...

161
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:28,248
然后作为叛徒被处于绞刑
and hanged as a traitor.

162
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:29,950
所以都结束了
So it's over.

163
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:32,685
海德里希在柏林有同谋
Heydrich has allies in Berlin:

164
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,487
那些人准备要背叛元首
men prepared to betray the Führer,

165
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:35,823
和他一样
just as he was.

166
00:12:35,823 --> 00:12:36,990
你得逮捕他们
You have to arrest them.

167
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:39,893
如果我们知道是哪些人  我们就会的
We would if we knew who they were.

168
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,230
我们不能确定  而这些人非常危险
We can't be sure, and these men are very dangerous.

169
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:47,034
所以
So...

170
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:50,871
你现在可以
you can now...

171
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,374
把枪还给我了
You can give me that gun back now.

172
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:09,857
怎么了
Hey.

173
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,860
怎么了
What is it?

174
00:13:15,863 --> 00:13:17,931
我知道你指望我坚强
I know that you count on me to be strong.

175
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:21,268
你确实很坚强啊  你是我知道的最坚强的人
You are strong. You're the strongest person I know.

176
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,705
当我想到要对我们的孩子们开枪的时候
When I thought about turning that gun on our children--

177
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:30,510
如果刚刚下车的人是海德里希
If Heydrich had pulled up in that car instead of me--

178
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:32,946
我知道  我知道
I know that. I know that.

179
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:34,882
但是我不能
But I couldn't have--

180
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:36,449
我们的孩子们  我做不到
Our children-- I couldn't have.

181
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:48,962

182
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:56,003
明白
Understood.

183
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:03,476
所以你们修好无线电了啊
You got that radio working, huh?

184
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,081
你他妈是个纳粹
You're a goddamn Nazi.

185
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:09,582

186
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,954
影片  交出来
The film. Hand it over.

187
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:16,423
这个吗
This film.

188
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,559
你敢放手  你就是个死人了
If you drop that, you're dead.

189
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,364
为了这卷片子  抵抗组织给你们多少钱
How much is the Resistance going to pay you for it?

190
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:25,765
五万
50,000.

191
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:27,167
听着  你们被骗了
Look, you guys are being cheated.

192
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:28,936
黑社会的卖价是那两倍
The Yakuza sold it for twice that,

193
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:31,704
并且我得告诉你们  我不认为抵抗组织有那么多钱
and I got to tell you I don't think the Resistance has the money.

194
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:32,940
放屁
Bullshit.

195
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:35,943
听着  你们需要钱  对吗
Look, you guys need cash. Am I right?

196
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:37,577
来养活你们的家人
To support your families.

197
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:40,147
不是吗  这就是为什么你们把像我这样的人偷渡到墨西哥
Come on, that's why you smuggle people like me down to Mexico.

198
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,348
- 你想说什么  - 闭嘴
- What's your point? - Shut up.

199
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:42,315
我不是纳粹
I'm not a Nazi.

200
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,716
但是我要把这卷片子卖给他们
But I am selling this film to them,

201
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:45,818
其实你们也可以大赚一笔  
and there can be a lot of money in this for you, too.

202
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:48,421
一大笔钱
A lot of money.

203
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:50,557
- 多少  - 我说了闭嘴
- How much? - I said shut up.

204
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,525
二十万日元
200,000 yen.

205
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:00,200
每人二十万日元
200,000 each.

206
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:08,575
我才是那个本该死的人
I'm the one who's supposed to die.

207
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:33,000

208
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:53,320

209
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,388
贸易部长在哪
Where is the Trade Minister?

210
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,491
我不知道  总督察
I don't know, Chief Inspector.

211
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:02,729
战后我一直没能联系上他
I have been unable to reach him since the--

212
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,064
我在这里
I am here.

213
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:10,737
您  还好吗  贸易部长
Are you...quite all right, Trade Minister?

214
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:29,389
从这场战争以来
Since the war,

215
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:33,326
我们和纳粹党的联盟一直不稳定
we have shared an uneasy alliance with the Nazis.

216
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:37,230
现在元首病了
Now the Führer is ill,

217
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:40,667
他的人吹嘘自己的意志力
and his men boast of their will...

218
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:45,272
我们清楚我们必须在他们进攻之前进攻
We know we must strike before they strike.

219
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,074


220
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,076
过来拿你的热狗
Get your hotdogs right here!

221
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:50,577
我们拿到了苹果蜜饯
We got candied apples and...

222
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,083
现在我们进了虎穴
Today we enter the tiger's cave.

223
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:58,851
我们进去是因为两周前
We enter it because two weeks ago

224
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:03,356
科学部长志村在他的口袋里发现了一个盒子
Science Minister Shimura found a capsule in his pocket,

225
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:06,459
盒子里面有一个从柏林的帝国研究委员会
and inside the capsule was microfilm

226
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:10,563
走私过来的微缩胶片
smuggled from the Reich Research Council in Berlin.

227
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:19,572
微缩胶片里的内容已经被确认
The contents of the microfilm has been confirmed.

228
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:25,011
总算  我们也拥有了
At long last, we, too, possess the data

229
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:28,115
能够建立海森堡设备的数据了
to build a Heisenberg device.

230
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:31,218
当设备创建完成时
When it is completed,

231
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:33,853
必须在北美纳粹党
the device must be in range

232
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,156
瞄准纽约市的
of North American Nazi targets...

233
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:38,958
目标范围内
of New York City.

234
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:41,794
这是属于我们的时刻
This is our moment.

235
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:45,532
我们必须毫不犹豫的抓住它
We must not hesitate to seize it.

236
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:47,234


237
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,246
贸易部长
Trade Minister.

238
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:07,154
我几乎可以肯定你已经和那位纳粹党上校
I am all but certain you have passed those plans

239
00:18:07,154 --> 00:18:10,723
把那些计划交给科学部长了
to the Science Minister with that Nazi colonel.

240
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,427
你是过来逮捕我的吗  总督察
Are you here to arrest me, Chief Inspector?

241
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,899
贸易部长  我知道这正是你所期望的
Trade Minister, I know that this is what you wish,

242
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:23,436
而且你看起来好像  很困扰
and yet you seem... troubled.

243
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:26,406
我期望能和纳粹党平权
I wish for parity with the Nazis,

244
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:29,242
来平衡权力  维护和平
to balance the power, to maintain the peace.

245
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:31,778
你已经听将军说了  战争不可避免
You heard the general. War is inevitable.

246
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,282
或许吧
Possibly.

247
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:39,051
但是有了这样一个武器
But with a weapon like this...

248
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:41,654
这样的战争怎么会赢呢
how can such a war be won?

249
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:50,263


250
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,320
把它打开吧
Let's open it up.

251
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,090


252
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:19,792


253
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,093



254
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:22,795



255
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:25,232


256
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:26,999
那就是这场交易的结果了
That's their end of the bargain.

257
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:28,835
带他离开这里  斯利姆
Get him out of here, Slim.

258
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,671
不要把它们都花在一个地方了  孩子们
Don't spend it all in one place, boys.

259
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:34,374


260
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:39,612
谢谢  兄弟
Thank you, man.

261
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:05,905


262
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:07,407
很高兴见到你
Am I glad to see you.

263
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:08,941
让我们带你去纽约吧
Let's get you to New York.

264
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:10,109

265
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:11,744
好的
Okay.

266
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:15,014
给  给  给  给  给
Here, here, here, here.


267
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:16,416
- 我的包呢  - 你的包在这
- Where's my bag? - Here's your bag.

268
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:17,584
快点  船长
Come on, Captain.

269
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,286
快点  杰克  快点回来
Come on, Jack, let's get back fast.

270
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:39,706


271
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:42,575
早上好  上校
Good morning, Obergruppenführer.

272
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:43,576
克里姆少校
Major Klemm.

273
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:44,644
邓肯上校
Obergruppenführer Duncan

274
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:45,645
很想与你谈话  长官
is eager to speak with you, sir.

275
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:46,746
乔·布莱克已经上报情况了吗
Has Joe Blake reported in?

276
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:48,281
他现在正在你办公室等你
He's waiting in your office now.

277
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:57,724
乔
Joe.

278
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:03,596
恭喜
Congratulations.

279
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:11,604
我很高兴
I'm very pleased.

280
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,848
怎么了  乔
Something wrong, Joe?

281
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:26,586
你告诉我你会给那些人报酬的
You told me you'd pay those men.

282
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:28,655
他们是罪犯  乔
They were criminals, Joe.

283
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:34,361
他们是想让你死的罪犯  你应该毫无同情才对
Criminals who wanted you dead. You should feel no remorse.

284
00:21:44,504 --> 00:21:46,172
朱莉安娜·科伦怎么样了
What about Juliana Crain?

285
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:47,440
她死了
Oh, she's dead.

286
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:50,377
几乎确定了
Almost certainly.

287
00:21:50,377 --> 00:21:53,380
已经快24个小时了  乔
It's been nearly 24 hours, Joe.

288
00:21:54,447 --> 00:21:57,450
你已经证明了自身的可靠性
You've proved yourself capable,

289
00:21:57,517 --> 00:21:59,852
但是未来
but in the future

290
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,021
你必须学会控制你的感情
you have to learn to keep your feelings in check.

291
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:06,158
我做不到  长官
I can't do that, sir.

292
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:08,294
是吗
Oh, you can't?

293
00:22:08,395 --> 00:22:10,863
我想要辞职
I'd like to resign.

294
00:22:12,732 --> 00:22:15,134
你辞不了职的  乔
You don't get to resign, Joe.

295
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:17,069
- 你已经拿到了你的胶片  - 没错
- You got your film. - Yes.

296
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:19,706
对元首极其重要的胶片
A film of great importance to the Führer.

297
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:22,575
想想那意味着什么吧  乔
Think about what that means, Joe.

298
00:22:24,477 --> 00:22:26,846
想想你父亲会有多为你骄傲
Think how proud your father will be.

299
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:32,284
我父亲甚至都不知道我在为你工作
My father doesn't even know I work for you.

300
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:33,853
他当然知道了
Oh, of course he does.

301
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:40,026
现在  我困住你
Now, I stuck with you...

302
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:43,262
是因为我一直相信
because I always believed

303
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:45,632
等时机到的时候
that when the time came,

304
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,834
你会去做必须做的事
you'd do what had to be done.

305
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:53,072
这不是我想要成为的人
This isn't the man I want to be.

306
00:22:57,744 --> 00:23:00,447
这不是你想成为的人吗
This isn't the man you wanted to be?

307
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,551
我明白了
I see.

308
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:15,962
看来我看错你了  乔
Well, it seems I misjudged you, Joe.

309
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:29,241
克里姆少校  我去柏林的航班是什么时候
Major Klemm, what time is my flight to Berlin?

310
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:31,043
一小时后起飞  长官
It leaves in an hour, sir.

311
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,948
我现在可以走吗
Can I go now?

312
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:41,921
可以  你可以走了
Yes, you can go.

313
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:30,002


314
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:39,912
你想见我  是吗  贸易部长
You wish to see me, Trade Minister?

315
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:49,321
你之前告诉我不要失去希望
You told me before to not lose hope.

316
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:52,692
我应该继续冥想
That I should keep meditating.

317
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:56,228
我希望冥想能给您带来平静
I hoped meditation might bring you peace,

318
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:57,697
正如它带给我的一样
as it does me.

319
00:24:57,764 --> 00:24:59,799
仅此而已吗
And nothing more.

320
00:25:04,637 --> 00:25:07,173
我去了公园冥想
I went to the park to meditate.

321
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:11,110
但它并没由给我带来平静
But it did not bring me peace.

322
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,181
它把我
It brought me...

323
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:18,585
带到了一个奇怪的地方
to a strange place.

324
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:20,953
那是旧金山
It was San Francisco

325
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:25,825
但不是这个旧金山
but not this San Francisco.

326
00:25:25,892 --> 00:25:29,796
那个旧金山被美国人统治着
It was ruled by Americans...

327
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:34,233
自由自在的走着  大喊着
walking freely, shouting...

328
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:37,069
笑着
and laughing.

329
00:25:38,605 --> 00:25:41,107
您是梦到了过去
You had a dream of the past.

330
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:44,043
不  不是
No. No.

331
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,613
那不是过去
It wasn't the past.

332
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:51,317
那感觉起来根本不像是一个梦
And it didn't feel like a dream.

333
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:04,096
联系一下皇妃
Get a hold of the Crown Princess.

334
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:07,634
告诉她我有紧急要务要处理
Tell her that I have an urgent matter to discuss.

335
00:26:31,658 --> 00:26:32,659


336
00:26:32,692 --> 00:26:34,426
朱莉安娜
Juliana.

337
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:35,995

338
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:43,069
朱莉安娜  嘿
Juliana. Hey.

339
00:26:46,405 --> 00:26:47,674
阿诺德
Arnold.

340
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:51,143
你怎么了
What happened to you?

341
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,947
只是发生了个意外
I just had an accident.

342
00:26:55,014 --> 00:26:56,582
你不想让伤口感染吧
You don't want to get that infected.

343
00:26:56,683 --> 00:26:58,785
- 过来  我来帮你  - 我不需要你的帮忙
- Come on, let me help you. - I don't need your help.

344
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:00,687
- 你是一个人吗  - 是啊  我一个人
- Are you alone? - Yeah, I'm alone.

345
00:27:00,753 --> 00:27:03,255
听着  你们  你们离开的那么急
Listen, you guys, you left in such a hurry,

346
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:05,457
我是想过来确认一下有没有事
I wanted to make sure everything was okay.

347
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:06,693
朱尔斯哪去了
Where's Jules?

348
00:27:06,726 --> 00:27:08,695
她走了
She's gone.

349
00:27:08,728 --> 00:27:10,730
她走了是什么意思  
What's that supposed to mean, she's gone?

350
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:12,865
意思就是她已经离开这里了
It means she had to get out of here.

351
00:27:16,535 --> 00:27:18,570
她安全吗
Is she safe?

352
00:27:18,705 --> 00:27:20,306
不  不是要跟你道谢
No, no thanks to you.

353
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:23,843
我也不知道到底是什么意思
I don't know what that's supposed to mean, either.

354
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,477
你为他们工作了多久  阿诺德
How long have you worked for them, Arnold?

355
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:27,146
在日本政府大厦
In the Nippon Building?

356
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:30,850
你怎么能这样做  你怎么会心安理得
How can you do it? How could you live with yourself?

357
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:32,852
监视你自己的人  你到底是什么样的人啊
Spying on your own people? What kind of man are you?

358
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:34,721
一个要照顾他家人的人
The kind of man that takes care of his family.

359
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:37,189
- 我努力来帮过  - 你没有照顾好你的家人
- I tried to help-- - You didn't take care of your family.

360
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:38,791
是你让特鲁迪死了的
You got Trudy killed.

361
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:42,962
我去你妈的  弗兰克
God damn you, Frank.

362
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,933
我没有害死我的女儿
I did not get my daughter killed.

363
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:50,302
- 我尽力去帮过她  - 你他妈就是个日本人
- I tried to help her. - You're a fucking Pon.

364
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:00,612
这个艾德有关  是吧
This is about Ed, isn't it?

365
00:28:00,747 --> 00:28:01,981
你知道艾德什么
What do you know about Ed?

366
00:28:02,048 --> 00:28:03,783
我就在监听室  弗兰克
I'm in a listening room, Frank.

367
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:04,951
我听到了一切
I hear everything.

368
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,819
我在电话里听到了他祖父
I heard his grandfather on the phone.

369
00:28:06,886 --> 00:28:08,087
阿诺德  你要帮他
Arnold, you got to help him.

370
00:28:08,154 --> 00:28:09,956
我帮不了他  没人帮得了他
I cannot help him. Nobody can help him.

371
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:12,024
拜托   宪兵队已经抓到他了
Come on. The Kempeitai's got him.

372
00:28:12,091 --> 00:28:13,826
- 弗兰克  - 宪兵队
- Frank-- - The Kempeitai.

373
00:28:13,893 --> 00:28:16,028
我尽力帮过我自己的女儿  但看看最后发生了什么
I tried to help my own daughter, and look what happened.

374
00:28:16,095 --> 00:28:18,898
- 拜托  - 你得放手了
- Oh, come on. - You got to leave this alone.

375
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:33,412
你需要
You'll need to--

376
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:35,782
你需要找一个日本人
You need to find a Pon.

377
00:28:38,951 --> 00:28:40,319
一个人脉广的人
Somebody well connected.

378
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:44,023
我不认识任何人脉广的日本人
I don't know any well connected Pons.

379
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:48,494
那去就找一个人脉广的人
Then find someone who does.

380
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:56,335

381
00:29:16,823 --> 00:29:18,524
诶  诶  诶  弗林克先生
Well, well, well, Mr. Frink.

382
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,292
你重新考虑好了吗
Have you reconsidered?

383
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:20,827
重新考虑
Reconsidered?

384
00:29:20,893 --> 00:29:22,261
是啊  我的提议啊
Yeah, my offer

385
00:29:22,328 --> 00:29:24,496
和我的日本客户一起
to place some more authentic Americana

386
00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:25,832
放置一些更真实的美国文物
with my Japanese clientele.

387
00:29:25,832 --> 00:29:27,433
听着  你遇到麻烦了  我们都遇上麻烦了
Listen, you got a problem. We both do.

388
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:28,700
什么麻烦
What sort of problem?

389
00:29:28,835 --> 00:29:30,669
我的一个朋友因射杀皇太子
A friend of mine's been arrested

390
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:31,871
被逮捕了
for shooting the Crown Prince.

391
00:29:31,938 --> 00:29:33,873
然后逼迫他认罪
Then forced him to confess.

392
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,008
所以那和我有什么关系
So what does that have to do with me?

393
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:37,176
他被抓时身上带着一把枪
He was caught with a gun.

394
00:29:37,243 --> 00:29:38,978
上膛的子弹是你的
The shells in the chamber were yours.

395
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,086
不好意思  但是我必须得关门了
Sumimasen, but I must close.

396
00:29:47,153 --> 00:29:49,922
有一位生病的阿姨  不好意思
Uh, uh, a sick aunt. Sumimasen.

397
00:29:50,857 --> 00:29:52,458
不好意思
Sumimasen.

398
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:56,428
不好意思
Sumimasen.

399
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:06,572
- 你做了什么  - 我朋友是无辜的
- What have you done? - My friend's not guilty.

400
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,008
在他们过来杀我之前只是时间问题了
It's only a matter of time before they come for me to kill me.

401
00:30:09,075 --> 00:30:11,643
你一定认识一些有钱的日本客人
You must have some wealthy Japanese clients.

402
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,012
如果是的话怎样
So what if I do?

403
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:14,613
如果你可以的话  我不知道
Well, if you could-- I don't know--

404
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,848
跟他们谈
talk to one of them,

405
00:30:15,915 --> 00:30:17,716
让他们牵线搭桥
get him to pull some strings.

406
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:20,019
牵线搭桥  你有病吗
Pull some st-- Are you out of your mind?

407
00:30:20,086 --> 00:30:21,287
别这样  我只是想帮你
Come on. I'm just trying to help you.

408
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:23,689
帮我  那是因为你  弗兰克先生
Help me? It's because of you, Mr. Frink,

409
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,291
我死定了
I'm a dead man.

410
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:27,226
是的  你会死定的
Yeah, you will be a dead man

411
00:30:27,293 --> 00:30:30,596
除非我们找到方法让我的朋友离开这
unless we find a way to get my friend out of this.

413
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:58,024
镇静剂的功效如何
How's that sedative treating you?

415
00:31:05,164 --> 00:31:08,334
我需要一些喝的
Mm. I need something to drink.

416
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:11,070
拼图
Puzzles.

417
00:31:12,438 --> 00:31:13,940
那么多拼图
So many puzzles.

418
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,407
而你是
And you are...

419
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:20,947
漂亮的一块
just another pretty piece.

420
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:26,718
我死了
I was dead.

421
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:28,654
可能是吧
Maybe you are.

422
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,956
你说的是什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

424
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,759
事实跟死亡一样可怕
Truth is as terrible as death.

425
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:35,661
但更难找
But harder to find.

426
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:44,336
你有脑子不太正常
You have an unnatural mind.

427
00:31:45,972 --> 00:31:48,440
你知道吗
Are you aware of that?

428
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,118
你已经有一个了
You already got one.

429
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,421
对   
Right.

432
00:32:08,995 --> 00:32:10,362
噢
Ohh.

433
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:11,397
我在哪里
Where am I?

434
00:32:11,463 --> 00:32:13,299
你回答我的问题  姑娘
You answer my questions, chickie,

435
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:15,401
而不是问别的
not the other way around.

436
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:19,371
你明白吗
You understand?

437
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:21,507
明白
Yeah.

439
00:32:29,515 --> 00:32:31,017
跟我来
Come with me.

441
00:32:57,776 --> 00:33:01,047 
59, 60...

443
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:30,836
你就是他  对吧
You're him, aren't you?

444
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:34,973
我是阿本德森  豪索尔尼·阿本德森
I'm Abendsen, Hawthorn Abendsen.

445
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,608
这是你的城堡
This is your castle.

446
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:40,712
这是我的城堡  就在这里
This is my castle right here,

447
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:43,849
有意识和无意识的头脑
the conscious and unconscious mind,

448
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:44,916
灵魂
the psyche.

449
00:34:44,983 --> 00:34:48,254
卡尔·荣格  知道吗
Karl Jung. Got it?

452
00:35:03,169 --> 00:35:04,336
那是家庭电影
That's a home movie.

453
00:35:04,403 --> 00:35:08,474
7月4日在菲尼克斯的烟火
4th of July fireworks in Phoenix.

454
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:12,978
1961年7月4日  不可能
4th of July in 1961. It's not possible.

455
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:14,846
但那就是
But it is.

456
00:35:14,913 --> 00:35:17,183
你正拿着它
You're holding it.

457
00:35:45,244 --> 00:35:47,846
告诉我你看到过的影片
Tell me about the film you saw.

458
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,016
它很像新闻影片
It's like a newsreel.

460
00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:01,493
我从未见过如此
I've never seen anything so...

461
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:06,131
荒凉的景象  那是  那是旧金山
desolate. It was-- It was San Francisco,

462
00:36:06,232 --> 00:36:07,499
但那全都毁灭了
but it was all ruins.

463
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:12,804
我可以认出金门大桥
I can make out the Golden Gate Bridge.

464
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:16,007
那里有一些受害者的影子
There were shadows of some of the victims.

465
00:36:16,074 --> 00:36:17,776
他们就像
They were like...

466
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:19,578
像烧着了
like burns.

467
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:31,490
那是
It was--

468
00:36:31,557 --> 00:36:33,759
结局
The end.

470
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:53,279
人们怎么了
What about people?

471
00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:55,080
- 他们怎么了  - 在爆炸之后
- What about them? - Did you see any

472
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:56,815
你有见到任何人吗  说吧
after the explosion? Come on.

473
00:37:01,787 --> 00:37:04,790
有男人被纳粹士兵列队
There were men lined up by Nazi soldiers.

474
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:07,058
看起来和他们在一起的还有
They looked like they were with the Resistance--

475
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:08,827
- 抵抗组织的游击队员  - 有多少
- partisans-- - How many?

476
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:11,129
10个  可能是12个
Ten, maybe 12 soldiers.

477
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:12,898
你有认出任何人吗
Did you recognize anyone?

478
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,006
你为什么要问我那些
Why would you ask me that?

479
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,641
只管回答问题
Just answer the question.

480
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:27,446
我男朋友弗兰克
My boyfriend Frank.

481
00:37:27,513 --> 00:37:31,216
他被一个人  一个年轻人枪决了
He was executed by, uh, a man, a young man.

482
00:37:31,317 --> 00:37:32,818
乔·布莱克
Joe Blake.

483
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:34,853
我知道他是谁  我知道他们俩是谁
I know who he is. I know who they both are.

484
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,121
怎样知道
How?

485
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:38,690
你有认出其他人吗
Did you recognize anyone else?

486
00:37:42,328 --> 00:37:43,829
弗兰克旁边的男人
The man next to Frank.

487
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,798
- 他是谁  - 我不肯定 
- Who was he? - I'm not sure.

488
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:48,467
他看起来很眼熟
He just looked familiar.

489
00:37:48,534 --> 00:37:52,604
好  我要给你看一张脸
Okay. I'm going to show you a face.

490
00:37:52,671 --> 00:37:56,007
如果那是你看到的人  那就告诉我
Tell me if it is the man you saw.

491
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:02,147
我看的影片  是准备要发生的吗
That film I saw-- is that what's going to happen?

492
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:08,119
这里的每一部影片都展示了像我们的现实
Each one of these films show a reality like ours

493
00:38:08,186 --> 00:38:10,956
但不是我们的
but not ours. 

494
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:15,694
你在看这些影片的时候知道了很多可怕的事情
Well, you learn an awful lot watching these films.

495
00:38:15,761 --> 00:38:19,631
我们中的一些是一样的
Some of us are just the same--

496
00:38:19,698 --> 00:38:23,201
在现实中是堕落或善良的
rotten or kind in one reality,

497
00:38:23,268 --> 00:38:25,537
在之后变得堕落或善良
rotten or kind in the next,

498
00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:27,906
但是大部分人是不同的
but most people are different,

499
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:31,477
取决于他们胃里有没有食物
depending on whether they have food in their belly

500
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:33,712
或他们是饥饿
or they're hungry,

501
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:35,381
安全还是害怕的
safe or scared.

502
00:38:35,414 --> 00:38:36,615
所以你看这些影片
So you watch these films.

503
00:38:36,682 --> 00:38:38,550
你告诉抵抗组织你看到
You tell the Resistance what you learn--

504
00:38:38,617 --> 00:38:40,652
的人和事
about the people you see and the things.

505
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:42,754
事情也可能发生在这里
Things that could happen here, too.

506
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:46,291
那就是为什么
That's why--

507
00:38:46,392 --> 00:38:48,594
那就是为什么纳粹想要这些影片
That's why the Nazis want these films.

508
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:52,664
不是纳粹  只是老阿道夫
Not the Nazis, just old Adolf.

509
00:38:52,731 --> 00:38:54,633
那疯狂的混蛋太偏执
That demented bastard's too paranoid

510
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,768
去让任何其他人看到那些
to let anyone else see them.

511
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:06,945
噢  天呐
Oh, God.

512 
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:08,947
等等
Wait.

513
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:14,553
那是你看到那个男人吗
Was this the man you saw?

514
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:17,255
在影片里
In the film,

515
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:18,857
他是被纳粹射杀的
he was shot by the Nazis.

516
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:21,292
他是游击队的一员  但在这里他是
He was one of the partisans, but here he's--

517
00:39:21,427 --> 00:39:22,494
他是一个纳粹
he's a Nazi.

518
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:24,863
所以就是那个男人  你认得他
So this was the man. You recognize him.

519
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:26,865
我觉得是
I think so.

520
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,501
我不知道
I don't know.

521
00:39:29,568 --> 00:39:30,769
你不知道  你不
You don't know. You don't--

522
00:39:30,836 --> 00:39:32,871
你要么认得他们中的一个  要么都不认得
You either recognize him, or you don't.

523
00:39:32,938 --> 00:39:34,540
我不  我不敢肯定
I'm not po-- I'm not positive.

524
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:35,774
- 快点  想  - 我在努力
- Come on, think! - I'm trying.

525
00:39:35,841 --> 00:39:37,576
你一定在哪里碰到过他
You must have met him somewhere,

526
00:39:37,643 --> 00:39:39,778
在哪个地方见过他
seen him someplace.

527
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,020
不然我们就倒霉了
Then we're screwed.

528
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:50,889
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

529
00:39:50,956 --> 00:39:53,459
那就是你在这里的原因  姑娘
That's the reason you're here, chickie.

530
00:39:53,459 --> 00:39:55,861
在日本人赢得战争的每部影片中
Every film where the Japs won the war,

531
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:59,297
旧金山迟早会被一枚炸弹清除掉
sooner or later San Francisco is wiped out by an A bomb--

532
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:01,833
在每一部影片  除了这一部
every one except this one

533
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,836
在这里  这个混蛋作为一个纳粹死在某处的小巷
where this bastard dies as a Nazi in an alley somewhere.

534
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:07,739
你是在告诉我  如果这个男人可以被找到  那
Are you telling me that if this man can be found, the--

535
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,976
我们可以阻止
we could stop--

536
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:13,445
是的
Yeah.

537
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:20,652
我不知道他是谁
I don't know who he is.

540
00:42:20,505 --> 00:42:22,874
我妹妹告诉我这些影片是一个解决方法
My sister said these films were a way out.

541
00:42:24,009 --> 00:42:25,310
是吗
Out?

542
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,614
她告诉我她发现了所有事的答案
She told me she'd found the answer to everything.

543
00:42:32,618 --> 00:42:33,819
是
Yeah.

544
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:44,996
我看到她
I saw her...

545
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:47,298
几天之前
a few days ago.

546
00:42:51,803 --> 00:42:54,105
她死了  我知道  我知道她死了
She's dead, I know. I know she's dead.

547
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:55,907
但她  她没有
But she-- she wasn't.

548
00:42:57,042 --> 00:43:00,445
有没有可能我妹妹在那里仍活着
Is it possible my sister is alive out there

549
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:02,047
以某种方式
somehow?

550
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:09,220
我说了你不能问问题
I said you don't ask questions.

501
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:35,381
他们是感到安全还是害怕
safe or scared.

502
00:38:35,414 --> 00:38:36,615
所以你看这些影片
So you watch these films.

503
00:38:36,682 --> 00:38:38,550
然后告诉抵抗组织你从中获得的信息
You tell the Resistance what you learn--

504
00:38:38,617 --> 00:38:40,652
告诉他们你看到的那些人和事
about the people you see and the things.

505
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:42,754
那些事儿本来也可能发生在这儿
Things that could happen here, too.

506
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:46,291
这就是为什么
That's why--

507
00:38:46,392 --> 00:38:48,594
这就是为什么纳粹想要这些影片
That's why the Nazis want these films.

508
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:52,664
想要它们的不是纳粹  是阿道夫
Not the Nazis, just old Adolf.

509
00:38:52,731 --> 00:38:54,633
那个疯狂的老混蛋太偏执了
That demented bastard's too paranoid

510
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,768
他不愿意让任何人看到这些
to let anyone else see them.

511
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:06,945
上帝啊
Oh, God.

512
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:08,947
等下
Wait.

513
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:14,553
这是那个你看到的人吗
Was this the man you saw?

514
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:17,255
在影片里
In the film,

515
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:18,857
他被纳粹射杀
he was shot by the Nazis.

516
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:21,292
他是游击队的一员  但是在这儿他是
He was one of the partisans, but here he's--

517
00:39:21,427 --> 00:39:22,494
他是一名纳粹
he's a Nazi.

518
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:24,863
所以就是这个男人  你认出他来了
So this was the man. You recognize him.

519
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:26,865
我想是的
I think so.

520
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,501
我不知道
I don't know.

521
00:39:29,568 --> 00:39:30,769
你不知道  你不
You don't know. You don't--

522
00:39:30,836 --> 00:39:32,871
你要么认出他来了要么没有
You either recognize him, or you don't.

523
00:39:32,938 --> 00:39:34,540
我不  我不能肯定
I'm not po-- I'm not positive.

524
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:35,774
- 拜托  回忆一下  - 我正想着呢
- Come on, think! - I'm trying.

525
00:39:35,841 --> 00:39:37,576
你一定在什么地方遇到过他
You must have met him somewhere,

526
00:39:37,643 --> 00:39:39,778
或者在哪儿见过他
seen him someplace.

527
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,020
那我们完蛋了
Then we're screwed.

528
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:50,889
你什么意思
What are you talking about?

529
00:39:50,956 --> 00:39:53,459
姑娘  这就是你在这儿的原因  
That's the reason you're here, chickie.

530
00:39:53,459 --> 00:39:55,861
在每部个日本人赢了战争的影片里
Every film where the Japs won the war,

531
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:59,297
旧金山早晚都会被原子弹给炸平
sooner or later San Francisco is wiped out by an A bomb--

532
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:01,833
每一部  除了这部
every one except this one

533
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,836
这部片子里这个混蛋是一名纳粹死在了一个巷子里
where this bastard dies as a Nazi in an alley somewhere.

534
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:07,739
你是说如果我们能找到这个人的话
Are you telling me that if this man can be found, the--

535
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,976
那我们就能阻止
we could stop--

536
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:13,445
是的
Yeah.

537
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:20,652
但我不知道他是谁
I don't know who he is.

538
00:40:40,205 --> 00:40:42,508


539
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,733


540
00:42:20,505 --> 00:42:22,874
我妹妹说这些片子就是我们的出路
My sister said these films were a way out.

541
00:42:24,009 --> 00:42:25,310
出路
Out?

542
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,614
她说这些影片会告诉我们所有事情的答案
She told me she'd found the answer to everything.

543
00:42:32,618 --> 00:42:33,819
是的
Yeah.

544
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:44,996
我看到她了
I saw her...

545
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:47,298
在几天之前
a few days ago.

546
00:42:51,803 --> 00:42:54,105
她死了  我知道  我知道她已经死了
She's dead, I know. I know she's dead.

547
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:55,907
但她  她没死
But she-- she wasn't.

548
00:42:57,042 --> 00:43:00,445
我妹妹现在可能还以某种方式活着吗
Is it possible my sister is alive out there

549
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:02,047
可能吗
somehow?

550
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:09,220
我说了你不能问问题
I said you don't ask questions.

551
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:11,723
你只能回答问题  明白吗
You answer them, got it?

552
00:43:13,058 --> 00:43:16,695
为什么  为什么你这么生我的气
Why? Why are you so angry at me?

553
00:43:16,762 --> 00:43:19,530
因为如果你看到了我所看的东西
Because if you'd seen what I've seen,

554
00:43:19,665 --> 00:43:21,532
你也会一样愤怒
you'd be angry, too.

555
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:24,836
等一下  等等
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

556
00:43:24,903 --> 00:43:26,237
我也在这些片子里吗
Am I in these films?

557
00:43:26,304 --> 00:43:27,472
为什么  为什么
Why? Why don't--

558
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:28,740
为什么人们就不能吸取教训呢
Why don't people ever learn?

559
00:43:28,807 --> 00:43:29,775
我在片子里  对吧
I am, aren't I?

560
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:30,809
你看到了什么
What did you see?

561
00:43:30,876 --> 00:43:32,377
恐惧和暴力
Fear and violence!

562
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,679
这就是我们
It's who we are.

563
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:35,847
是我们整个悲惨的世界
our whole miserable world,

564
00:43:35,914 --> 00:43:37,883
和像你一样的人  你  你
and people like you, you j-- you j--

565
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,317
- 你最后  - 我最后怎么了
- you end up-- - End up how?

566
00:43:39,384 --> 00:43:41,419
我最后怎么了  我妹妹怎么了
How do I end up? What about my sister?

567
00:43:41,486 --> 00:43:42,888
回答我
Answer me!

568
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:45,991
关于你的影片
The film of your life--

569
00:43:46,057 --> 00:43:48,760
你不会想知道你最后怎么了的
you don't want to see how it ends.

570
00:44:30,736 --> 00:44:32,403


571
00:44:36,207 --> 00:44:38,744


572
00:44:42,247 --> 00:44:43,915


573
00:44:45,216 --> 00:44:46,985
你好
Woman: Hello.

574
00:44:47,052 --> 00:44:50,288
是魏格纳夫人吗
Is that Mrs. Wegener?

575
00:44:52,758 --> 00:44:54,359
你是哪位
Who is this?

576
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:56,427


577
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,766
我是户上信介
This is Tagomi Nobusuke.

578
00:45:00,832 --> 00:45:03,969
我去年在斯德哥尔摩的一个商会上
I met the colonel last year in Stockholm

579
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:05,804
遇到过上校
at a trade convention.

580
00:45:06,938 --> 00:45:10,008
我能和他说话吗
Would it be possible to speak to him?

581
00:45:13,344 --> 00:45:14,846
我丈夫
My husband...

582
00:45:16,681 --> 00:45:17,983
已经死了
is dead.

583
00:45:19,317 --> 00:45:20,651
他
He...

584
00:45:20,786 --> 00:45:22,788


585
00:45:24,189 --> 00:45:25,156


586
00:45:26,524 --> 00:45:29,494
我能问一问发生什么了吗
May I ask what happened?

587
00:45:32,898 --> 00:45:35,801
他们说他开枪自尽了
They say he shot himself.

588
00:45:35,834 --> 00:45:37,803
说他是一个叛徒
He was a traitor.

589
00:45:40,605 --> 00:45:43,374
但你要知道
You must know.

590
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:49,848
你丈夫是因为努力想把这个世界变得更美好才死的
Your husband died trying to make the world a better place.

591
00:45:51,382 --> 00:45:52,918
那他做到了吗
And did he?

592
00:45:56,855 --> 00:45:59,825
只是努力是不够的  不是吗
Trying is not enough, is it?

593
00:45:59,825 --> 00:46:01,927


594
00:46:16,975 --> 00:46:18,877
这个叫凯拉的怎么样
What about this guy Kera?

595
00:46:18,944 --> 00:46:20,278
他怎么了
What about him?

596
00:46:20,345 --> 00:46:21,980
他在日本政府大厦工作
He works in the Nippon Building.

597
00:46:22,047 --> 00:46:24,215
他是个官员  喜欢日本米酒
He's a bureaucrat with a taste for sake

598
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:26,251
和关于朱迪·加兰的纪念品
and Judy Garland memorabilia.

599
00:46:29,687 --> 00:46:31,689
好吧  这个呢
All right, this one?

600
00:46:31,756 --> 00:46:33,859
京都  不行  他是一个丝绸商
Kyoto. No, he's a silk merchant.

601
00:46:33,892 --> 00:46:35,260
他已经回到日本
He moved back to Japan.

602
00:46:36,394 --> 00:46:38,063
我但凡有点理智  现在就已经在
If I had any sense, I'd be on a bus

603
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:39,597
驶向中立区的汽车上了
to the Neutral Zone right now.

604
00:46:39,664 --> 00:46:41,066
那你怎么还在这儿呢
Then why aren't you?

605
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:42,567
你肯定不缺钱
You must have enough money.

606
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,369
你去过中立区吗
You ever been to the Neutral Zone?

607
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:47,238
- 没有  - 那你就不会知道
- No. - Then you have no idea

608
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:48,907
对于一个有教养的人来说
how difficult it would be for a man of culture

609
00:46:48,974 --> 00:46:50,976
在这种龌龊的地方活下去有多难
to survive in an armpit like that.

610
00:46:52,043 --> 00:46:54,279
好吧  我找到一个 
All right, I got it.

611
00:46:54,345 --> 00:46:55,380
保罗 凯索拉
Paul Kasoura.

612
00:46:55,446 --> 00:46:56,414


613
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:57,648
不可能
Yeah, not a chance.

614
00:46:57,715 --> 00:46:59,150
为什么不行  上面说他是个律师
Why not? It says he's a lawyer.

615
00:46:59,217 --> 00:47:00,618
律师的关系网并不广  不是吗
Lawyers are well connected, aren't they?

616
00:47:00,685 --> 00:47:02,087
是  他确实是个律师
Yeah, he's indeed a lawyer,

617
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:03,688
但我把你做的那个坐牛酋长的护喉
but I sold him and his lovely wife Betty

618
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:05,290
卖给了他和他可爱的妻子贝蒂
that Sitting Bull gorget you made.

619
00:47:05,356 --> 00:47:06,892
- 所以呢  - 我卖给他的是赝品
- Yeah, so? - So it's a forgery.

620
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:08,126
现在我们最不需要的
The last thing we need

621
00:47:08,193 --> 00:47:11,329
就是来自凯索拉夫妇的过多关注
is any further attention from the Kasouras.

622
00:47:11,396 --> 00:47:13,131
嘿  你听见我刚才说什么了吗
Hey, did you hear what I just said?

623
00:47:13,198 --> 00:47:14,966
这个人是埃德的最后一次机会
This man's Ed's last chance

624
00:47:15,033 --> 00:47:17,002
也是你的最后一次机会
and yours, too.

625
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,608
过来
Now come on.

626
00:47:44,095 --> 00:47:45,830
这些人是黑社会
Those guys are Yakuza.

627
00:47:45,931 --> 00:47:49,134
是啊  所以我建议我来和他们交涉
Yeah. So I suggest you let me do the talking.

628
00:47:53,571 --> 00:47:55,140


629
00:48:00,411 --> 00:48:02,247
- 又是你  - 我们想见凯索拉先生
- You again. - We need to see Mr. Kasoura.

630
00:48:02,313 --> 00:48:05,183
凯索拉先生不见不期而至的访客
Mr. Kasoura does not receive unannounced visitors,

631
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,352
- 我们已经告诉过你  - 没关系  弗雷德
- and you were told-- - It's all right, Fred.

632
00:48:08,954 --> 00:48:11,022
你想要什么  奇尔丹先生
What is it you want, Mr. Childan?

633
00:48:11,089 --> 00:48:13,124
先生  我们只需要占用你的一点时间
Uh, just a moment of your time, sir.

634
00:48:13,191 --> 00:48:15,093
我保证你不会后悔的
I assure you it will be worth it.

635
00:48:17,262 --> 00:48:18,096
进来吧
Come in.

636
00:48:18,163 --> 00:48:20,498


637
00:48:26,204 --> 00:48:29,074
你是一名刑事辩护律师
You are a criminal defense lawyer,

638
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:30,241
对吗  凯索拉先生
are you not, Mr. Kasoura?

639
00:48:30,308 --> 00:48:32,777
- 是的  - 我替你找了个案子
- Yes. - I have a case for you,

640
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:35,280
一个非常重要的案子
a very important one.

641
00:48:35,346 --> 00:48:37,782
你看  这个人的一个朋友
You see, this man has a friend

642
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:41,252
被诬告攻击皇太子
who has been falsely accused of attacking the Crown Prince.

643
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:43,989
我们一般不谈及这种事
We do not speak of such things.

644
00:48:43,989 --> 00:48:45,190
当然  当然
Of course. Of course.

645
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:47,758
但  但他是无辜的
But-- But he is innocent.

646
00:48:47,825 --> 00:48:50,295
我十分确定
I am absolutely certain of it.

647
00:48:51,396 --> 00:48:53,131
这和我有什么关系
What does that have to do with me?

648
00:48:53,198 --> 00:48:55,766
你不明白吗
Well, don't you see?

649
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:58,336
如果这个攻击皇太子的人
If the wrong man has been charged

650
00:48:58,403 --> 00:49:00,305
是被诬告的
with attacking the Crown Prince,

651
00:49:00,371 --> 00:49:03,808
那这就是最大的误判了
there can be no more serious miscarriage of justice.

652
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:07,212
如果你能证明这个的话
Now, were you to prove this,

653
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:12,183
你就会变得很有名  非常出名
it would make you yuumei, very yuumei.

654
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:15,020
我都是接私人客户  奇尔丹先生
My clients are private, Mr. Childan.

655
00:49:15,053 --> 00:49:17,022
我对声望不感兴趣
I have no interest in fame,

656
00:49:17,022 --> 00:49:19,257
我对给一个攻击了皇太子的人做辩护
and I certainly have no interest

657
00:49:19,324 --> 00:49:22,527
更是一点兴趣都没有
in defending a man accused of attacking the Crown Prince.

658
00:49:22,593 --> 00:49:25,030
请原谅一个白人的肤浅理解
Forgive a white man's shallow understanding,

659
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:27,198
但是责任和帝国命令比起来
but surely duty to empire dictates--

660
00:49:27,265 --> 00:49:30,035
你们可以走了
You must leave now.

661
00:49:30,101 --> 00:49:33,204
奇  奇尔丹先生
Mr., uh, Mr. Childan,

662
00:49:33,271 --> 00:49:36,541
他八万日元卖给你
he sold you this neck plate...

663
00:49:37,842 --> 00:49:40,145
的那个护喉
for 80,000 yen.

664
00:49:41,746 --> 00:49:42,747
怎么了
Yes?

665
00:49:43,881 --> 00:49:45,383
真是绝妙的价格
An excellent price

666
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:46,917
- 为这么一件  - 它是假的
- for such a-- - It's a fake.

667
00:49:47,052 --> 00:49:48,286
弗兰克
Frank.

668
00:49:49,887 --> 00:49:51,056
你为什么这么说
Why do you say that?

669
00:49:51,089 --> 00:49:54,292
因为
Well, uh, because, uh...

670
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:57,595
因为这是我做的
because I made it.

671
00:49:57,662 --> 00:49:59,797
他在撒谎
He's lying.

672
00:49:59,864 --> 00:50:01,832
我没有
No, I'm not.

673
00:50:01,899 --> 00:50:04,669
边缘我还没抛光
I left the edges unpolished.

674
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:06,271


675
00:50:07,172 --> 00:50:10,041
这里和这里
here and here,

676
00:50:10,108 --> 00:50:14,045
就是为了愚弄像你这种经验丰富的收藏家
to fool even the most experienced collector like you.

677
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,415
很明显这个人被骗了
Uh, this man is clearly deluded.

678
00:50:17,482 --> 00:50:19,016
都是因为他的朋友被指控他的压力太大了
The stress of seeing his friend accused.

679
00:50:19,084 --> 00:50:20,518
我们真诚的道歉  凯索拉先生
Our sincerest apologies, Kasoura-san.

680
00:50:20,585 --> 00:50:22,787
- 我们现在就走  - 你们哪儿都不能去
- We'll leave now. - You're going nowhere.

681
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:47,812


682
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:57,555
你错过那条岔道了
You missed the turnoff.

683
00:50:57,622 --> 00:51:00,525
我什么也没错过  我们要去斯托克顿
I didn't miss anything. We're going to Stockton.

684
00:51:03,294 --> 00:51:05,163
阿本德森说了不杀她
Abendsen said not to kill her.

685
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:07,398
我不在乎阿本德森说了什么
I don't care what Abendsen said.

686
00:51:07,465 --> 00:51:08,599


687
00:51:08,666 --> 00:51:10,368
她已经看到他的脸了
She's seen his face now.

688
00:51:11,436 --> 00:51:13,538
我不同意
Karen: I am not okay with this.

689
00:51:13,604 --> 00:51:16,141
我不需要你的同意  卡伦
I'm not asking your permission, Karen.

690
00:51:16,207 --> 00:51:18,143
你什么时候这么软弱了
Since when did you get so soft?
