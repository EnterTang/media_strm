
1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This is fun.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yeah, it really is.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I’m sad.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yeah, me, too.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I don't know what the hell I’m doing.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I don't know how to be single.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I don't know how to be not single.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
on Monday I have to give a coworker his pants back.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I’ll take that over what happened to me--

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
my girlfriend left me without saying good-bye.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I’m getting divorced.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I’m never gonna have an adult relationship.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I haven't had sex in three months.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I got nothing that'll top that.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
God, this sucks.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I hate feeling this way.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Me, too.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Next time I am with someone,

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I am gonna take it real slow.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yeah.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And I’m not gonna be with anyone at all for a while.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Smart.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
