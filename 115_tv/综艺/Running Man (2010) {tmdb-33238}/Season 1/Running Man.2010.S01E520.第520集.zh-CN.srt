1
00:00:46,664 --> 00:00:49,709
那么，你们在卡丁冲击的投资，
So, the majority
of your investment in...

2
00:00:49,751 --> 00:00:53,463
大部分将用于初期的建设
Kart Attack wiII go towards
initiaI construction costs.

3
00:00:53,505 --> 00:00:56,341
这部分成本将通过收益赚回
A percentage of which wiII be
paid back through earnings

4
00:00:56,382 --> 00:00:58,676
细节参见之前我给你们的小册子
which are outIined in the
bookIet I handed out earIier.

5
00:00:58,718 --> 00:01:02,514
主要在A2、D5和E15，
PrimariIy in sections
A2, D5 and E15,

6
00:01:02,555 --> 00:01:06,059
另见附录9、11、12
but aIso in the appendix
sections 9, 11 and 1 2.

7
00:01:08,061 --> 00:01:11,314
听着，我知道我一下子
给你们的数字太多
Listen, I know I'm throwing
a Iot of numbers at you

8
00:01:11,356 --> 00:01:13,274
也许会把你们弄迷糊了
and that can get confusing.

9
00:01:13,316 --> 00:01:15,902
所以，让我给你们点可见的东西
So, Iet me give you
something a IittIe more visuaI

10
00:01:15,944 --> 00:01:18,321
帮你们理解我们
要做的是什么
to heIp show you
what we're aII about.

11
00:01:18,363 --> 00:01:20,365
沃尔特，我们准备好了
WaIter, we're ready.

12
00:01:24,577 --> 00:01:26,204
哦，我的天
Oh, my.

13
00:01:26,246 --> 00:01:29,582
我搭档，沃尔特，穿的是
我们的赛车服原型
My partner, WaIter, is wearing
our prototype racing gear.

14
00:01:29,624 --> 00:01:31,209
这是每个员工的标准配置
It's standard issue
for aII empIoyees.

15
00:01:31,251 --> 00:01:34,462
- 酷
- 这只是原型
- CooI.
- It's just a prototype.

16
00:01:34,504 --> 00:01:36,297
真正的制服
将是防火材料制成，
The actuaI uniform
wiII be fIame retardant,

17
00:01:36,339 --> 00:01:38,800
这是好事，是不是？
which is a good thing,
don't you think?

18
00:01:38,842 --> 00:01:41,094
因为你酷的冒烟了，
朋友。辍―！
'Cause you are smoking,
my friend. Tss-ss!

19
00:01:43,388 --> 00:01:45,431
所以，总结起来，
So, to sum up,

20
00:01:45,473 --> 00:01:48,726
卡丁冲击，
不止是卡丁车道
Kart Attack, much more
than a go-cart track.

21
00:01:48,768 --> 00:01:50,854
这是家人在琳琅满目的小食店
It's a famiIy sharing
an ice cream cone

22
00:01:50,895 --> 00:01:53,231
分享蛋筒冰淇淋
at our fuIIy-stocked snack bar.

23
00:01:53,273 --> 00:01:55,275
这是孩子们玩最新电游的
It's a safe and secure pIace

24
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:57,610
安全有保障的场所
for your kids to pIay
the Iatest video games.

25
00:01:57,652 --> 00:02:01,531
这是在我们的信仰自由间里
It's a bar mitzvah in one of our
faith-friendIy function rooms.

26
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:05,243
举行犹太受诫礼（13岁男子）
- But most of aII, it's...
- Fun!

27
00:02:05,285 --> 00:02:07,203
我们希望你是下一个
We hope you'II be the next

28
00:02:07,245 --> 00:02:09,456
体验卡丁冲击的人！
谢谢
to experience a ''Kart Attack''!
Thank you.

29
00:02:12,917 --> 00:02:14,919
太棒了，伙计们
That was awesome, guys.

30
00:02:14,961 --> 00:02:16,880
谢谢，谢谢
Thank you, thank you.

31
00:02:16,921 --> 00:02:19,507
我本想给沃尔特
的入场加点烟雾效果的，
I was gonna use a fog machine
for WaIter's entrance,

32
00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:21,593
不过后来一想这是私人场所，
再说――
but I figured it was
an intimate setting, and--

33
00:02:21,634 --> 00:02:23,887
不，这很好。谢谢
No, it was great.
Thanks.

34
00:02:23,928 --> 00:02:26,681
那么，我们能商量几分钟吗？
So, couId we just have a few minutes
to taIk things over?

35
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:28,641
当然，好好聊
Yeah, taIk away.

36
00:02:28,683 --> 00:02:30,602
我来拆道具
I'II just be
breaking down the set.

37
00:02:30,643 --> 00:02:32,562
好的
AII right.

38
00:02:34,773 --> 00:02:38,067
- 那么，你怎么想？
- 唔，非常好
- So, what do you think?
- WeII, it was very good.

39
00:02:38,109 --> 00:02:41,571
- 非常专业
- 是的，我惊呆了
- Very professionaI.
- Yeah, I'm surprised.

40
00:02:41,613 --> 00:02:43,865
我是说，他们显然下了功夫
I mean, they've cIearIy done
their research.

41
00:02:43,907 --> 00:02:47,285
- 是的，他们下了。那么，咱们干吗？
- 哦，不！
- Yes, they have. So, we in?
- Oh, no!

42
00:02:49,621 --> 00:02:51,956
为什么？
Why?

43
00:02:51,998 --> 00:02:53,833
看，亲爱的
Look, honey,

44
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,044
我说了听他们的方案，
我也听了，
I said that I wouId hear
their proposaI and I did,

45
00:02:56,085 --> 00:02:58,004
可什么也改变不了
那是卡丁车的事实
but nothing in it changes the fact
that it's go-carts.

46
00:02:58,046 --> 00:03:00,590
我知道，可是――拜托，
这才是有意思的地方
I know, but-- come on,
that's what's fun about it.

47
00:03:00,632 --> 00:03:03,176
再说，这是个可靠的投资
PIus, it's a soIid investment.

48
00:03:03,218 --> 00:03:06,679
而且，他们在想
给辆卡丁车取你的名字
Besides, they're thinking of naming
a go-cart after you.

49
00:03:06,721 --> 00:03:08,723
真的。“黛比拉号”
They are.
''The Debra.''

50
00:03:08,765 --> 00:03:10,725
一辆黑色的
It's bIack.

51
00:03:11,893 --> 00:03:14,729
这真是每个少女的梦想
That is every girI's dream.

52
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:16,439
拜托，我不能让他们空欢喜一场
Come on, I can't
turn 'em down,

53
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:18,900
他们忙活了半天。
叫我怎么跟他们说？
they did a show and everything.
What am I gonna teII 'em?

54
00:03:18,942 --> 00:03:22,070
我不知道，告诉他们你想怎么样。
我得去接孩子了
I don't know, teII 'em what you want.
I gotta go pick up the kids.

55
00:03:22,112 --> 00:03:25,240
孩子――什么时候他们身上
的投资能见着个子啊？
Kids-- when we gonna see a dime
from that investment?

56
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:29,869
跟他们说去吧
Just go taIk to them.

57
00:03:29,869 --> 00:03:31,830
我肯定他们接受得了的，
他们是专业人士
I'm sure they can handIe it,
they're professionaIs.

58
00:03:33,206 --> 00:03:35,917
呜，呜，呜……
Whoo, whoo, whoo...

59
00:03:41,673 --> 00:03:44,759
- 嘿
- 嘿，伙计！好啦！
- Hey.
- Hey, man! AII right!

60
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:47,137
那么，黛比拉怎么说？
她来不来？
So, what did Debra say?
Is she on board?

61
00:03:47,178 --> 00:03:50,473
- 噢，不是那么回事
- 什么？
- Awww, not reaIIy.
- What?

62
00:03:52,642 --> 00:03:54,686
什么？
What?

63
00:03:54,727 --> 00:03:58,106
你说什么呢，伙计？
她说我们干得很好
What are you taIking about, man?
She said we did a great job.

64
00:03:58,148 --> 00:04:00,066
眼神交流得很好
I had good
eye contact going.

65
00:04:00,108 --> 00:04:02,527
我还做了总结手势，
这可是必杀技！
I did the summary hands,
it was kiIIer stuff!

66
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:05,071
我知道，我知道。
她就是――她不上钩
I know, I know.
She just-- she wasn't biting.

67
00:04:05,113 --> 00:04:07,031
那你呢？
What about you?

68
00:04:07,073 --> 00:04:09,868
你想就这么过一辈子？
You want to Iive Iike this
the rest of your Iife?

69
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:12,120
我知道，我知道
I know, I know.

70
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,248
哦，伙计。
你老婆真差劲
Oh, man.
Your wife sucks.

71
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,210
嘿，嘿，沃尔特，
这可不太好
Hey, hey, WaIter,
that is not cooI.

72
00:04:19,252 --> 00:04:21,921
- 咱们还在商务会议中
- 对不起，伙计
- We're stiII in a business meeting.
- I'm sorry, man.

73
00:04:21,963 --> 00:04:25,550
只是这衣服也太他妈热了
It's just this suit
is so friggin' hot.

74
00:04:25,592 --> 00:04:28,887
对不起，伙计们。
我是说，你们做得很好，真的
I'm sorry, guys. I mean, you did
a good job, reaIIy.

75
00:04:28,928 --> 00:04:32,515
- 就这样？你不来了？
- 是的，我想
- So that's it? You're out?
- Yeah, I think.

76
00:04:32,557 --> 00:04:34,476
哦，你知道，
Oh, you know,

77
00:04:34,517 --> 00:04:36,478
我需要你们把支票还给我
I'm gonna need
that check back.

78
00:04:37,604 --> 00:04:38,563
什么？
What?

79
00:04:38,605 --> 00:04:41,816
两星期前我给你们的定金。
我需要拿回来
That deposit I gave you a coupIe
weeks ago. I'm gonna need it back.

80
00:04:41,858 --> 00:04:43,318
哦，是的，定金
Oh, yeah, the deposit.

81
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:45,236
是的，没了
Yeah, it's gone.

82
00:04:45,278 --> 00:04:47,113
什么意思没了？
What do you mean, gone?

83
00:04:47,155 --> 00:04:50,325
唔，你知道，
全花在演示上了
WeII, you know, spent it
on the whoIe presentation.

84
00:04:50,366 --> 00:04:53,745
制服、黑板架。
这也是新的
The suit, the easeI.
This is new.

85
00:04:55,914 --> 00:04:57,791
你全花了？
1000块？
You spent aII of it?
A thousand doIIars?

86
00:04:57,832 --> 00:04:59,709
你怎么能这样？
How couId you do that?

87
00:04:59,751 --> 00:05:02,086
我告诉过你，
我们今天来只为了
I just toId you, the onIy reason
we came here today,

88
00:05:02,128 --> 00:05:03,922
能得到更多的钱
was to get more money.

89
00:05:03,963 --> 00:05:07,133
哦，我的天，我怎么告诉黛比拉
我损失了1000块
Oh my God, how am I gonna teII Debra
I Iost a thousand doIIars?

90
00:05:07,175 --> 00:05:10,094
我可再也不跟她说话了
I wouIdn't taIk
to her anymore.

91
00:05:14,109 --> 00:05:16,986
- 嘿，你好呀，美国少女小姐
- 嘿
- Hey, there, Miss Teen USA.
- Hey.

92
00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:20,115
嘿
Hey.

93
00:05:20,156 --> 00:05:22,659
那是什么，床上的新毯子？
看着真不错
What are those, new sheets in the bed?
Those Iook nice.

94
00:05:24,077 --> 00:05:26,162
- 那不是新的
- 哦
- They're not new.
- Oh.

95
00:05:26,204 --> 00:05:28,414
唔，有种不错的特质
WeII, something about 'em
Iooks nice.

96
00:05:28,456 --> 00:05:30,416
也许是因为盖着的人
Maybe it's the person in 'em.

97
00:05:32,168 --> 00:05:34,629
你打什么主意呢，雷？
嘿咻还是高尔夫？
What are you after, Ray?
Sex or goIf?

98
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:38,591
都不是
Neither.

99
00:05:38,633 --> 00:05:40,468
天
Jeez.

100
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,429
男人就不能欣赏织物？
Can't a guy admire Iinens?

101
00:05:48,601 --> 00:05:51,187
嘿，你知道――
Hey, you know--

102
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:52,856
还记得――
remember--

103
00:05:52,897 --> 00:05:54,983
还记得咱们去的
那个城里的餐厅吗？
remember that restaurant
we went to in the city

104
00:05:55,024 --> 00:05:58,653
一个人直接上来要钱，
我没带――
and the guy out front was asking
for money and I didn't have any--

105
00:05:58,695 --> 00:06:00,947
我没零钱，所以你给了他个5块？
I didn't have change
so you gave him a five?

106
00:06:02,323 --> 00:06:04,242
是的，我记得
Yeah, I remember that.

107
00:06:04,284 --> 00:06:06,953
你还想拿回来，
然后他就跑了
He ran away after you tried
to get it back from him.

108
00:06:06,953 --> 00:06:08,538
是啊
Yeah.

109
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,416
不过然后我意识到，
他比咱们更需要这笔钱，
But then I reaIized,
he needed it more than we did

110
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,209
然后就不追他了
and I stopped
chasing him.

111
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:16,504
- 咱们都喜欢那段回忆
- 是啊
- We aII have fond memories of that day.
- Yeah.

112
00:06:17,714 --> 00:06:19,674
我刚刚想到这件事，
I was just thinking of that,

113
00:06:19,716 --> 00:06:22,385
因为我最近做了一件
类似的事情
'cause I did something
simiIar recentIy.

114
00:06:22,427 --> 00:06:25,388
- 是吗？
- 是的
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

115
00:06:26,681 --> 00:06:28,600
我给了司各特和沃尔特1000块
I gave Scott and WaIter
a thousand doIIars.

116
00:06:30,393 --> 00:06:32,312
什么？！
What?!

117
00:06:32,353 --> 00:06:35,190
好了，听着，我知道你听了
会不高兴――
Okay, Iook, I know you're gonna
get upset about this--

118
00:06:35,231 --> 00:06:37,817
天哪！
1000块？！
My God!
A thousand doIIars?!

119
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:40,236
想想那个快乐的流浪汉
Remember the happy hobo.

120
00:06:40,278 --> 00:06:41,863
我给了他5块钱！
I have him $5!

121
00:06:41,905 --> 00:06:44,365
好吧，可是对流浪汉来说，
这就像是1000块了
Okay, but to a hobo,
that's Iike a thousand.

122
00:06:44,407 --> 00:06:46,367
这么说我叫你别给他们钱
So you gave
Scott and WaIter money

123
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:48,328
你还是给了？
after I asked you not to?

124
00:06:48,369 --> 00:06:51,039
不，我是在你
叫我别给之前给的
No, I gave it to 'em
before you asked me not to.

125
00:06:52,081 --> 00:06:54,209
你怎么能这样？
How couId you do that?

126
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,253
- 对不起，我会把钱要回来的
- 不是钱的事！
- I'm sorry, I'II get the money back.
- It's not about the money!

127
00:06:57,295 --> 00:07:01,049
那我就不理解
这么怨恨的叫嚷是怎么回事了
Then I reaIIy don't understand
the hatefuI screaming.

128
00:07:03,051 --> 00:07:05,011
你对我就这么不尊重，
You reaIIy have so IittIe
respect for me,

129
00:07:05,053 --> 00:07:07,055
做这种事连问都不问我？
that you wouId do that
without asking me?

130
00:07:07,096 --> 00:07:09,349
- 我尊重你
- 显然不是！
- I respect you.
- ObviousIy not!

131
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,768
你说都没跟我说就开支票了！
You wrote the check before you
even taIked to me about it!

132
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,521
- 因为我以为你会同意的！
- 唔，我不同意！
- Because I though you wouId say yes!
- WeII, I'm saying no!

133
00:07:14,521 --> 00:07:16,481
好吧，是你改主意了！
Okay, you changed
your mind!

134
00:07:20,735 --> 00:07:24,364
那么你想――回到让你看着
好极了的毯子里吗？
So you wanna-- get back in the sheets
where you Iook so nice?

135
00:07:26,491 --> 00:07:28,493
我真不相信你会这么做！
I can't beIieve
you did this!

136
00:07:28,535 --> 00:07:30,495
好吧，听着，我错了
Okay, Iisten,
I screwed up.

137
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:32,789
我是说，我乱花的也是我的钱
Okay, but it's my money
to screw up with.

138
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:38,419
你说什么？
What did you say?

139
00:07:41,005 --> 00:07:43,133
乱搞的什么――？
With which to screw up--?

140
00:07:51,683 --> 00:07:53,643
什么？我说的什么？
What? What did I say?

141
00:08:24,215 --> 00:08:27,051
你要是在装东西的话，
我这还有几双袜子！
If you're doing a Ioad,
I got some socks!

142
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,585
难怪了！
No wonder!

143
00:08:52,836 --> 00:08:55,631
嘿，这怎么调的59度？
Hey, why is this on 59?

144
00:08:57,132 --> 00:09:00,010
我昨晚上盖太多，热坏了
I was hot Iast night with
aII those covers on me.

145
00:09:04,264 --> 00:09:06,308
怎么了？你睡得不舒服？
Why? Were you
uncomfortabIe?

146
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:10,104
不。我盖了毛巾和浴室门垫
No. I had a toweI
and a bath mat.

147
00:09:10,145 --> 00:09:12,523
睡得像个宝宝
I sIept Iike a baby.

148
00:09:13,816 --> 00:09:16,360
- 给
- 这是什么？
- Here.
- What's this?

149
00:09:16,402 --> 00:09:18,904
我昨晚做出来的点东西
A IittIe something
I worked up Iast night.

150
00:09:18,946 --> 00:09:21,532
“洗衣，75块一星期
''Laundry, $75 a week.

151
00:09:21,573 --> 00:09:23,492
大扫除，
GeneraI housecIeaning,

152
00:09:23,534 --> 00:09:25,536
200块一星期”
$200 a week.''

153
00:09:25,577 --> 00:09:28,539
- 这是什么，账单？
- 没错
- What is this, a biII?
- That's right.

154
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:32,209
“全天照料孩子，
1000块一星期”
''FuII time chiId care,
a thousand doIIars a week.''

155
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:34,169
是的，这项上我给你优惠了
Yeah, I gave you
a break on that one.

156
00:09:34,211 --> 00:09:36,964
双胞胎我只算了一件
I biIIed the twins
as one item.

157
00:09:37,005 --> 00:09:40,050
那么，你要我付你钱
做妻子了？
So, you're charging
me now, to be the wife?

158
00:09:40,092 --> 00:09:43,053
唔，如果钱都是你的，
那么做“妻子”的应该有工钱
WeII, if it's aII your money,
then ''the wife'' shouId get paid.

159
00:09:43,095 --> 00:09:45,305
啊哈
Uh-huh.

160
00:09:45,347 --> 00:09:48,976
“私人厨师，300块”
''PersonaI chef, $300.

161
00:09:49,017 --> 00:09:52,438
我想“厨师”这个词用得也太不严格了
I think we're using the word ''chef''
pretty IooseIy.

162
00:09:54,231 --> 00:09:55,899
嘿
Hey.

163
00:09:55,941 --> 00:09:58,777
我给爱丽订的
女童子军曲奇到了吗？
Those GirI Scout cookies
I ordered from AIIy come in yet?

164
00:09:58,819 --> 00:10:01,488
- 不，还没呢
- 该死……
- No, not yet.
- Damn...

165
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:05,284
我这是想当追随者
（想要Tagalong体育器材）吗？
am I jonesin'
for a ''TagaIong.''

166
00:10:05,325 --> 00:10:07,619
吃点Hydrox（奶油夹心饼），
别难过了
Have a Hydrox,
take the edge off.

167
00:10:09,246 --> 00:10:11,415
在这等着，我给你拿个七彩吊裤带
Wait here, I'II get you a pair
of rainbow suspenders.

168
00:10:11,457 --> 00:10:13,333
你可以去牛仔比赛上做小丑了
You can be a rodeo cIown.

169
00:10:15,252 --> 00:10:18,172
是吗，唔，昨晚这里有点冷
Yeah, weII, it got a IittIe chiIIy here
Iast night.

170
00:10:18,172 --> 00:10:20,174
嘿，你戴个帽子干嘛？
Hey, what are you
doing with that cap?

171
00:10:20,215 --> 00:10:23,469
哦，是的！卡丁冲击。
我猜咱们是合伙人了
Oh, yeah! Kart Attack.
I guess you and me are partners now.

172
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,929
哦，这么说你也投资了
Oh, so you invested too.

173
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:27,848
你开玩笑吗？
那两个伙计的演示很出色
Are you kidding me?
Those guys did a great presentation,

174
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,601
一下把我震住了。
烟雾机都有，什么都用上了
BIew me away.
Fog machine and everything.

175
00:10:30,642 --> 00:10:33,145
那你的帽子呢，雷？
Where's your hat, Ray?

176
00:10:33,187 --> 00:10:35,481
怎么不戴戴你1000块的帽子？
Why don't you put on
your thousand-doIIar hat?

177
00:10:36,815 --> 00:10:39,568
你怎么不给我来碗
300块的麦片呢？
Why don't you pour me
a $300 bowI of cereaI?

178
00:10:45,282 --> 00:10:47,201
你应该戴戴你的帽子，雷，
免费的广告
You shouId wear the hat,
Ray, free advertising.

179
00:10:47,242 --> 00:10:49,161
唔，我不知道我能不能戴帽子
WeII, I don't know
if I can wear a hat.

180
00:10:49,203 --> 00:10:51,246
我还没申请许可呢
I haven't asked
permission yet.

181
00:10:51,288 --> 00:10:53,499
嘿，罗伯特可以随便
拿他的钱投资
Hey, Robert can invest
his money however he wants.

182
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,292
他没结婚，
就他一个人
He's not married,
he's aIone.

183
00:10:55,334 --> 00:10:58,003
嘟哒，嘟哒……
Doo-dah, doo-dah...

184
00:10:58,045 --> 00:11:00,214
是啊
Yeah.

185
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,176
别担心，罗伯特，
你这样还好。看看这个
Don't worry, Robert,
you're better off. Look at this.

186
00:11:04,218 --> 00:11:05,969
这单子是我妻子给我的，
Here's a Iist
my wife gave me

187
00:11:06,011 --> 00:11:07,513
要我为娶她付钱
of what she's charging
me to be married to her.

188
00:11:07,596 --> 00:11:10,140
喔啊――知道吗，黛比拉？
Whoa-- you know what, Debra?

189
00:11:10,182 --> 00:11:11,934
- 字写得真漂亮
- 谢谢
- You have beautifuI handwriting.
- Thank you.

190
00:11:11,975 --> 00:11:13,102
拜托！不是说字的问题
Come on! It's not about
the handwriting.

191
00:11:13,143 --> 00:11:15,062
看看她都找我
要什么钱！
Look at what she's
charging me for!

192
00:11:15,104 --> 00:11:17,523
这个数是个什么意思？
What the heII is that
number right there?

193
00:11:17,564 --> 00:11:20,234
一财年的总计
That's the totaI
for the fiscaI year.

194
00:11:20,275 --> 00:11:22,236
这比我挣得还多！
That's more than I earn!

195
00:11:22,277 --> 00:11:24,321
哦，你注意到了？
Oh, you noticed that?

196
00:11:24,363 --> 00:11:26,782
是吗，可事实是得我来挣
Yeah, but I actuaIIy earn it.

197
00:11:28,951 --> 00:11:31,495
嗨，亲爱的
Hi, dears.

198
00:11:31,495 --> 00:11:33,705
黛比拉，我需要借你的洗衣机用用
Debra, I need
to borrow your washer.

199
00:11:33,747 --> 00:11:36,417
- 弗兰克把我们的弄坏了
- 没坏
- Frank broke ours.
- It's not broken.

200
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,420
你放进去之前，
让我把他们的拆了
Before you put that in,
Iet me take theirs apart

201
00:11:39,461 --> 00:11:41,630
好看看应该是什么样的
so I can see what it's supposed
to Iook Iike.

202
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,050
看，我们这有点事
Look, we're kinda
in the middIe of something here,

203
00:11:45,092 --> 00:11:47,970
所以你们能不能
过几年再过来？
so couId you come back
in a coupIe of years?

204
00:11:48,011 --> 00:11:51,932
你在做什么？
在浴缸里做私酒呢？
What are you doing?
Making moonshine in the bathtub?

205
00:11:52,891 --> 00:11:54,852
我给你买的那套
有棒球手的
Where are those
nice pajamas

206
00:11:54,852 --> 00:11:57,563
好看的睡衣呢？
with the basebaII
pIayers I got you?

207
00:11:58,897 --> 00:12:00,899
- 这是什么？
- 你想知道这是什么？
- What's this?
- You wanna know what that is?

208
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:02,776
好的，我来告诉你这是什么，玛丽
Yeah, I'II teII you
what that is, Marie.

209
00:12:02,818 --> 00:12:05,446
你是家庭主妇，
就像我
You're a homemaker,
Iike me.

210
00:12:05,487 --> 00:12:07,448
好吧
Okay.

211
00:12:09,575 --> 00:12:12,536
你不认为你在家庭的财政决定上
Don't you think that you're entitIed
to an equaI say

212
00:12:12,578 --> 00:12:15,873
- 有平等的说话权吗？
- 绝对的，亲爱的
- in your famiIy's financiaI decisions?
- AbsoIuteIy, dear.

213
00:12:15,914 --> 00:12:19,001
我列的这张单子
就是要让雷明白这点
This is a Iist I put together
to make that point with Ray.

214
00:12:19,042 --> 00:12:22,171
看她的7上加了一横。
多好看哪！
Look how she puts a Iine
through her sevens. Isn't that nice?

215
00:12:25,758 --> 00:12:28,343
怎么了？
What?

216
00:12:28,385 --> 00:12:30,304
只是看着有些――
Just Iooking through
some of this--

217
00:12:30,345 --> 00:12:32,723
你宣称你做的家务活
housekeeping things
you cIaim you do.

218
00:12:35,517 --> 00:12:38,687
我想也许我也有权分到些
这里头的钱
I think maybe I'm entitIed
to some of this money.

219
00:12:41,065 --> 00:12:43,484
看来有人在报虚账
Looks Iike someone's
padding the biII.

220
00:12:43,484 --> 00:12:45,444
看，雷，有人闯进来打扫
Look, Ray,
I can't heIp it

221
00:12:45,444 --> 00:12:47,279
我有什么办法呢？
if peopIe break in here
and cIean.

222
00:12:47,321 --> 00:12:49,573
是的，唔，你说的“进来”的地方，
Yeah, weII, the ''in here''
you're taIking about

223
00:12:49,615 --> 00:12:51,742
指的是咱们用
我的工资买的房子
is the house we bought
with my paycheck.

224
00:12:51,784 --> 00:12:53,702
你是说你比我更有价值
Are you saying you're
more vaIuabIe than me

225
00:12:53,744 --> 00:12:55,496
因为你能往家带工资条？
because you bring
home a paycheck?

226
00:12:55,537 --> 00:12:58,290
我没这么说。
我想是社会那么说的
I'm not saying that.
I think society says that.

227
00:12:58,332 --> 00:13:00,334
好吗？
你应该去跟他们说
AII right?
You shouId taIk to them.

228
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,294
事实上，雷蒙德，
判断一个人生命
ActuaIIy, Raymond,
the best way to determine

229
00:13:02,336 --> 00:13:04,254
的价值的最好方法
the vaIue of someone's Iife

230
00:13:04,296 --> 00:13:07,132
- 就是过失致死赔偿
- 哦，很好
- is with a wrongfuI death settIement.
- Oh, good.

231
00:13:07,174 --> 00:13:09,176
很好，因为我们
这就要发生一件了
Good, 'cause we're about
to have one.

232
00:13:10,886 --> 00:13:12,930
不，真的，我约会过一个
过失致死索赔评定人
No, reaIIy, I dated a wrongfuI
death cIaims adjuster.

233
00:13:12,971 --> 00:13:14,389
她的工作是算出
And it was her job
to figure out

234
00:13:14,431 --> 00:13:16,350
如果一个被爱的家人
死于意外
what a jury
wouId award a famiIy

235
00:13:16,391 --> 00:13:17,851
陪审团该判
赔偿这个家庭多少
if a Ioved one were
kiIIed an accident.

236
00:13:17,893 --> 00:13:20,729
换句话说，
他们值多少
In other words,
what they were worth.

237
00:13:20,771 --> 00:13:23,065
想想她都得考虑些什么，
有意思极了
It was fascinating to see
what she had to consider.

238
00:13:23,107 --> 00:13:26,777
没敢再跟她约第二次，
不过很有意思
Too morbid for a second
date, but fascinating.

239
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:27,986
比如什么？
Like what?

240
00:13:28,028 --> 00:13:30,614
比如他们考虑你是个什么样的人
Like they consider what kind of person
you were.

241
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:33,742
就拿爸来说吧
Take Dad,
for exampIe.

242
00:13:33,784 --> 00:13:36,120
假设有人把钢琴砸他头上了
Let's say someone
dropped a piano on him.

243
00:13:37,162 --> 00:13:39,915
好吧
Okay.

244
00:13:39,957 --> 00:13:43,210
陪审团将考虑
他是如何生活的
A jury wouId be asked to consider
what kind of Iife he Ied.

245
00:13:43,252 --> 00:13:46,046
他是不是个快乐的人？
他有没有给别人带来快乐？
Was he a happy person?
Did he bring joy to others?

246
00:13:46,088 --> 00:13:48,006
他会不会停下来闻玫瑰花？
Did he stop
and smeII the roses?

247
00:13:48,048 --> 00:13:50,342
是的，是的，是的
Yes, yes and yes.

248
00:13:51,343 --> 00:13:53,262
你才不热爱生活！
You don't enjoy Iife!

249
00:13:53,303 --> 00:13:56,098
你天天下午锁在
洗澡间里3个小时
You spend three hours every afternoon
Iocked in the bathroom.

250
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:00,102
躲着你，
我就是这样享受生活的！
Hiding from you,
that's how I enjoy Iife!

251
00:14:02,146 --> 00:14:04,606
所以，我们可以认为
他值不了太多
So, we can assume
he wouIdn't fetch much.

252
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:06,567
妈会好点
Mom wouId fare
sIightIy better

253
00:14:06,608 --> 00:14:09,361
因为他们会把痛苦和忍受
考虑进去
because they factor in
pain and suffering.

254
00:14:09,403 --> 00:14:11,447
是，好吧，咱们都知道他们值多少
Yeah, aII right, we aII know
what they're worth.

255
00:14:11,488 --> 00:14:13,449
那我和黛比拉谁会赢？
But who wouId win
between me and Debra?

256
00:14:13,449 --> 00:14:15,701
唔，咱们在说的是死亡，
雷蒙德
WeII, we're taIking
about death here, Raymond.

257
00:14:15,743 --> 00:14:17,661
这可不会有赢家
There's reaIIy
no winning.

258
00:14:17,703 --> 00:14:19,705
好吧，说得对，
谁值得多？
Okay, yeah,
who's worth more?

259
00:14:19,747 --> 00:14:21,665
这就有点复杂了
It's a IittIe compIicated.

260
00:14:21,707 --> 00:14:23,584
我是说，陪审团可能考虑任何事
I mean, a jury couId Iook
at aImost anything.

261
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,502
比如说，你知不知道
For exampIe,
did you know

262
00:14:25,544 --> 00:14:27,463
他们对有魅力的人更同情？
that they're more sympathetic
to an attractive person?

263
00:14:27,504 --> 00:14:30,090
傻眼了吧，雷密欧
Say good night,
Ray-mo.

264
00:14:37,681 --> 00:14:41,226
我相信如果把戴比拉的生命
呈现给陪审员，他们会看到
I'm sure if Debra's Iife was
presented to a jury, they wouId see

265
00:14:41,268 --> 00:14:43,896
- 她充满活力
- 是，是，好吧
- that she was very active.
- Yeah, yeah, okay.

266
00:14:43,937 --> 00:14:45,856
她勤劳、健康、
That she worked out,
she was heaIthy,

267
00:14:45,898 --> 00:14:47,733
精神饱满、疯狂的热爱生活――
spirited, she had
a zest for Iife--

268
00:14:47,775 --> 00:14:49,693
知道了！
Got it!

269
00:14:49,735 --> 00:14:52,071
并且他们会更同情黛比拉因为
And they wouId aIso be
more sympathetic to Debra

270
00:14:52,071 --> 00:14:54,490
她是主要的照料和养育者
because she is the primary
caregiver and nurturer.

271
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:56,366
我胜出
I win.

272
00:14:56,408 --> 00:14:58,702
等等――等一下，
等一等，那我呢？
Wait-- wait a minute,
wait a minute, what about me?

273
00:14:58,744 --> 00:15:01,288
晤，雷蒙德，我猜
WeII, Raymond, I guess

274
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,248
你是经济上的供给者
you're the financiaI provider.

275
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,709
说的对极了。
奶酪是我挣的
Damn straight.
I make the cheddar, baby.

276
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:07,920
是的。还有什么？
Yeah. What eIse?

277
00:15:07,961 --> 00:15:09,922
嗯……
Um...

278
00:15:11,215 --> 00:15:13,175
我不知道
I don't know.

279
00:15:16,887 --> 00:15:18,931
拜托！
Come on!

280
00:15:18,972 --> 00:15:20,974
我――我热爱生活
I-- I enjoy Iife.

281
00:15:21,016 --> 00:15:24,103
我疯狂的热爱生活。
我疯狂透了
I have a zest for Iife.
I'm totaIIy zesty.

282
00:15:24,144 --> 00:15:27,564
我的幽默感呢，哈？
这个怎么样？
How about my sense of humor, huh?
How about that?

283
00:15:27,606 --> 00:15:29,149
怎么样？
What about it?

284
00:15:29,191 --> 00:15:31,610
我很有幽默感，出色的幽默感
I have a good one.
I have a good sense of humor.

285
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,071
是真的。
讲个你的笑话，亲爱的
That is true.
TeII one of your jokes, dear.

286
00:15:34,113 --> 00:15:36,031
什么？讲哪个？
What? Which one?

287
00:15:36,073 --> 00:15:37,991
就讲那个
一个人
TeII the one about the guy

288
00:15:38,033 --> 00:15:40,828
走进酒吧，
who goes into a bar,

289
00:15:40,869 --> 00:15:44,498
一盘花生拍起了他的马屁
and there's a dish of peanuts
that says nice things to him.

290
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,167
他问酒保：
“这些花生是怎么了？”
And he asks the bartender
''What's with these peanuts?''

291
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:50,546
酒保说：
“它们是免费的（马屁精）”
And the bartender says
''They're compIimentary.''

292
00:15:53,632 --> 00:15:55,884
就讲那个
TeII that one, dear.

293
00:15:55,926 --> 00:15:57,636
你――你刚说了，妈
You-- you just toId it, Ma.

294
00:15:57,678 --> 00:15:59,179
不，不。 你讲起来好笑极了
No, no. You teII it so funny.

295
00:15:59,221 --> 00:16:01,723
你把结尾都说了，妈
You just toId
the ending, Ma.

296
00:16:01,765 --> 00:16:03,725
唔，那就讲开头。
我喜欢你――
WeII, teII the beginning.
I Iove it when you--

297
00:16:03,767 --> 00:16:05,811
妈，我不会讲这个，
因为你把好笑的那句都抖出来了！
Ma, I'm not teIIing the joke
because you bIew the punch Iine!

298
00:16:05,853 --> 00:16:07,771
- 你明白吗？
- 好吧，好吧！
- You understand that?
- AII right, aII right!

299
00:16:07,813 --> 00:16:11,984
- 疯狂的热爱生活
- 她说了“它们是马屁精”
- What a zest for Iife.
- She said ''They're compIimentary''!

300
00:16:12,025 --> 00:16:13,944
好笑的就在这了！
That's the whoIe joke!

301
00:16:13,986 --> 00:16:16,321
别给自己辩护了
Stop defending yourseIf.

302
00:16:16,321 --> 00:16:18,282
你往家带工资
You bring home
the paycheck.

303
00:16:18,282 --> 00:16:20,576
往家带工资的人
就是国王
Whoever brings home
the money is the king.

304
00:16:20,617 --> 00:16:23,328
- 讨论结束
- 说得好，父亲。看到了？
- End of story.
- WeII put, Father. You see?

305
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,788
他可以随便处置钱
He can do whatever he wants
with the money.

306
00:16:24,788 --> 00:16:26,749
呃呵――玛丽，
你没有不舒服吗？
Ugh-- Marie,
doesn't that bother you?

307
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,751
她没的选择
She has no choice
in the matter.

308
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:31,712
我是国王
I am the king.

309
00:16:31,754 --> 00:16:36,258
而现在，陛下要回城堡了
And now, His Majesty
wiII retire to his castIe,

310
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,762
他会在那等着
王室奶酪烤三明治
where he wiII await
the royaI griIIed cheese sandwich.

311
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,141
快走，傻子！
你逗我开心
Come, oaf!
You amuse me.

312
00:16:48,437 --> 00:16:50,773
我到地狱里见你
I'II see you in heII.

313
00:16:54,818 --> 00:16:57,196
玛丽，你怎么能让他这么说？
Marie, how can you
Iet him taIk that way?

314
00:16:57,237 --> 00:16:58,697
弗兰克想怎么说都没关系，
Frank can say
whatever he wants,

315
00:16:58,739 --> 00:17:00,240
他从来没掌握钱
he never controIIed
the money.

316
00:17:00,282 --> 00:17:04,286
他把工资条给我，
我怎么花都行
When he brought home a paycheck,
I did whatever I wanted with it.

317
00:17:04,328 --> 00:17:06,580
你说什么呢？
爸爸可不知道这个
What are you taIking about?
Dad had no idea about that.

318
00:17:06,622 --> 00:17:08,457
不，有时候他也会打听起来
No, sometimes
he'd get nosy.

319
00:17:08,499 --> 00:17:10,375
不过然后我就给他做顿
丰盛的晚餐
But I'd make him
a heavy dinner

320
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:11,835
然后他就在沙发上睡着了
and then he'd faII asIeep
on the couch

321
00:17:11,877 --> 00:17:15,339
然后我又把钱调配起来了
and I started moving
the money around.

322
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,299
阴险
DiaboIicaI.

323
00:17:18,717 --> 00:17:21,178
他天真的程度
还真是惊人
It's amazing
how cIueIess he is.

324
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,388
你知道吗，有30多年了，
Do you know
that for more than 30 years

325
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,265
我一直在送钱给
I've been giving money

326
00:17:25,307 --> 00:17:27,226
南美的孩子买书？
to buy books
for chiIdren in South America?

327
00:17:27,267 --> 00:17:29,186
你认为你爸会同意这么做吗？
You think your father
wouId have approved of that?

328
00:17:29,228 --> 00:17:31,188
他连给我们的书都不想买
He didn't Iike
buying us books.

329
00:17:34,858 --> 00:17:37,528
他――他从不知道我存的
He-- he never knew about
aII that money I saved

330
00:17:37,569 --> 00:17:39,613
咱们去意大利的钱。
另外，黛比拉，
for our trip to ItaIy.
And Debra,

331
00:17:39,655 --> 00:17:42,449
我从没告诉弗兰克
我借给你们俩的钱
I never toId Frank
about the Ioan I gave you two.

332
00:17:42,491 --> 00:17:44,618
- 借什么钱？
- 没事的，玛丽，
- What Ioan?
- That's okay, Marie,

333
00:17:44,618 --> 00:17:46,703
你不用――
you don't have to--

334
00:17:46,745 --> 00:17:49,498
你们俩刚结婚的时候，
住在那个小公寓里
When you first got married
and you were Iiving in that apartment.

335
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,708
- 什么钱？
- 不，那个――那没多少
- What Ioan?
- No, it-- it wasn't much.

336
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,878
只是一点让咱们度过难关的钱
It was just a IittIe something
to get us over a rough spot.

337
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,964
是的，亲爱的，
只有2500块
Yes, dear,
it was just $2,500.

338
00:17:57,005 --> 00:17:58,966
哦！
Ooh!

339
00:17:59,007 --> 00:18:02,719
2500块？你――
你从没跟我说过
$2,500? You-- you
never toId me about that.

340
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:05,139
是的，可你需要新轮胎，
咱们的洗碗机也坏了，
Yeah, but we needed new tires
and the dishwasher was broken

341
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,057
而你又还没拿到奖金
and you hadn't gotten
your bonus yet.

342
00:18:07,057 --> 00:18:09,601
- 你已经尽力了
- 所以你就找我妈了？！
- And you were doing the best you couId.
- So you went to my mother?!

343
00:18:09,643 --> 00:18:12,813
我告诉黛比拉她不用还的，
她是家里人
I toId Debra she didn't have
to pay me back, she's famiIy.

344
00:18:12,855 --> 00:18:15,232
爱是不能用钱衡量的。
再说――
And you can't put
a price on Iove. And anyway--

345
00:18:15,232 --> 00:18:19,027
- 我也不是那种――
- 我两星期后就还她了
- I'm not the kind of person--
- I paid her back in two weeks.

346
00:18:20,237 --> 00:18:22,197
你的生活因为
玛丽・巴伦基金的拨款
Your Iife made possibIe
by a grant

347
00:18:22,197 --> 00:18:24,867
而得以延续
from the Marie Barone
Foundation.

348
00:18:31,749 --> 00:18:33,709
天。你还做了什么？
My God. What eIse
did you do?

349
00:18:33,709 --> 00:18:36,128
还有什么我不知道的？
What eIse don't
I know about?

350
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,630
- 没有了
- 得了吧。如果你能做出
- Nothing.
- Come on. If you can do things

351
00:18:38,672 --> 00:18:41,258
向我妈借钱这样的事，
还有什么钱方面的事
Iike borrow money from my mother,
what other money stuff

352
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,385
- 是我不知道的？
- 没了
- don't I know about?
- Nothing.

353
00:18:43,427 --> 00:18:46,263
看，你做了卡丁车的事，
Look, you did
the go-cart thing

354
00:18:46,305 --> 00:18:49,141
我做了你妈那件事，就那一次
and I did the thing
with your mother that one time.

355
00:18:49,183 --> 00:18:51,810
所以――你知道，
咱们扯平了
So-- you know,
we're even.

356
00:18:51,852 --> 00:18:55,773
喔啊！
等一等！
Whoa!
Wait a minute!

357
00:18:55,856 --> 00:18:57,983
看看你周围，雷蒙德，
你很幸福
Look around, Raymond,
you got it good.

358
00:18:58,025 --> 00:19:00,819
- 不管她做的什么都不是瞎搞
- 不不不
- Whatever she's doing is working.
- No, no, no.

359
00:19:00,861 --> 00:19:03,113
- 真的，你还做了什么？
- 雷蒙德……
- ReaIIy, what eIse did you do?
- Raymond...

360
00:19:03,155 --> 00:19:05,491
嘿，嘿，嘿，
听着，阿扁。
Hey, hey, hey,
Iisten, cubby.

361
00:19:05,532 --> 00:19:08,243
一只猴子拉个铃，
然后出来了小球，
When the IittIe monkey rings a beII
and the peIIet comes out,

362
00:19:08,285 --> 00:19:10,454
小猴子不会问
小球是怎么来的，
he doesn't ask
how the peIIet got there.

363
00:19:10,496 --> 00:19:13,624
它只会好好玩它的球
He just enjoys
the peIIet.

364
00:19:23,217 --> 00:19:25,302
你知道吗？
也许你是对的
You know what?
Maybe you were right.

365
00:19:25,344 --> 00:19:28,806
我只是说，也许咱们是该
I'm just saying, maybe we shouId
consuIt each other now

366
00:19:28,847 --> 00:19:31,517
- 商量所有的钱的事情了，好吗？
- 好吧，好的，当然
- in aII the money stuff, okay?
