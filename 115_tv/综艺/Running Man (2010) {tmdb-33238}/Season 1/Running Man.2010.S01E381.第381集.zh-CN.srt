Shortly after accidentally clicking "like" on nearly 400 of his ex-girlfriend's facebook's photos earlier today,

3
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:14,980
panicked area man Adam Neutzling spoke to Onion reporters about his mistake.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,212
I was just looking at... one of her photos that showed on my news feed,

5
00:00:19,212 --> 00:00:21,230
and the next thing I know, I just...

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,439
liked every single photo she post in the last four years.

7
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,577
I didn't mean to.

8
00:00:26,577 --> 00:00:28,439
It... just kind of happened.

9
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,225
The 28 year old told reporters

10
00:00:30,225 --> 00:00:36,660
that he had browsed through fourteen of his ex-girlfriend's albums while inadvertently clicking "like" each and every picture,

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,153
including dozens from her office picnic last fall,

12
00:00:39,153 --> 00:00:41,391
her trip to New York in 2010

13
00:00:41,391 --> 00:00:44,899
and a photo of her and her first boyfriend from 2006.

14
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:49,900
I thought if I went back and click "unlike" on all those pictures then she shouldn't be getting notifications.

15
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,150
but then I saw some other albums,

16
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,900
and I ended up liking any more photos on my wall...

17
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,074
Shit...

18
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,070
God damn it...

19
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,300
I look like just shared last four she said somethings too.

20
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,250
Shit...

21
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:08,250
