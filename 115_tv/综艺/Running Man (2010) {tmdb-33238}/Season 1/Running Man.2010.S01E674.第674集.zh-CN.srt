
1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Keep it down. Don't back it up.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
(LIONS ROARING)

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Lying on its back, keep going.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
ON RADIO: Come in. Do you read me?

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Having waited days, well, it's pretty grim now it's happening, it's...

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yeah, I mean, it's something we really wanted to film,

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
but it's not... Not very tasteful.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's quite rare behaviour and we didn't think we were able to get it on film,

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
but now that we're here, it doesn't feel like a privilege to watch.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It just feels like a bit of an ordeal.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
ATTENBOROUGH: It's never easy for anyone to watch a hunt,

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
especially when the odds are stacked like this.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
But the sequence that the crew managed to shoot

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:06,000
is a valuable record of a very rarely seen behaviour.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
is a valuable record of a very rarely seen behaviour.
