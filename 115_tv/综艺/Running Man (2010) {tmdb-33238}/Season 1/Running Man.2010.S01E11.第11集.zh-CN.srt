1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,200
Come on, let's go,
we're gonna be late!

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,300
Why do we even
have to go to church?

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,700
Because like everyone else,
we are hedging our bets.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,300
It's Christmastime. God pays a lot
closer attention this time of year.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,500
It's like October in baseball.
Every game counts.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,900
I can't find my
church purse anywhere.

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,200
- What the...
- Or the bottom half of that dress.

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,000
At least I'm not dressed
like a sister wife.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,800
Well, at least my dress didn't
come with a stripper pole.

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,800
Dad.

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,200
Hey, it's Christmas.
Deck the halls, not each other.

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,900
- Okay, I just have to get my purse.
- No, no, d-d-don't go back up.

13
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,000
You know, trying to get you guys to
go to church is like herding cats.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,200
Honey, honey, honey,
why don't we just not go?

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,000
- We're going to church. Come on, come on, come on. Please?
- All right.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,900
Yeah, but it's just, it's--
it's a week until Christmas,

17
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,800
and I'd rather get stuff done
than sit and pray that it gets done.

18
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,800
Honey, honey, if everyone who didn't
want to go to church didn't go to church,

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,400
it would just be two old women
in the front row, shushing empty pews.

20
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,700
- I found it. Ready.
- Great, let's go.

21
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,600
- Clashes with your shoes.
- No, no, no. I know what you're doing.

22
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,100
You're just trying to psych me out.

23
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,500
Am I?

24
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,200
Damn it.
Dad, give me two seconds.

25
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,500
It's hopeless.
It's hopeless.

26
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,700
Just a minute.
Turn around, Mandy.

27
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,800
Come on, down the stairs,
down the stairs.

28
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,100
All right, everybody.
Time for church.

29
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,400
- Move it! Move it! Move it! Move it!
- All right.

30
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,100
Keep it moving. Keep it moving.
This is great. Thank you.

31
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,600
And for the record,
I got the ball rolling.

35
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,700
Stop. Come on. You're in church.

36
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,600
I know.
I think God sent him to me.

37
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,200
Mom. Mom. Mom. Ryan's here.

38
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,600
- Oh, my God.
- Honey, don't say "God" in church.

39
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,700
Mike.

40
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,700
Oh, God.

41
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,600
Halleluja

42
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,800
- That's Boyd's father.
- Yeah, I know.

43
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,500
He got Kristin pregnant
and then deserted her.

44
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,400
- Y--we all know that.
- Well, he doesn't.

45
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,100
Honey, what do you think
he's doing here?

46
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,500
I don't know. What do you say I drag
him out by his pretty hair and ask him?

47
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,400
Look, I wasn't expecting this
either, but it's Christmas--

48
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,000
happiness, good feelings,
nuts roasting over an open fire.

49
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,000
Kristin,
what was Ryan doing at church?

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yeah.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Okay.

52
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,300
Ryan's back in town,
and he reached out to me,

53
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,900
so we've seen him a couple times.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
He wants to be a part of Boyd's life.

55
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,100
Oh, well, honey,
if that's what you want,

56
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,400
then--then you have our full support.

57
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,200
You have your mother's full support.

58
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,900
I'm still in that "what, are you
freaking kidding me?" Camp.

59
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,200
Look, I know what it's like
to have an awesome dad,

60
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,700
and--and even if it's a long shot,
I want Boyd to have a chance at that, too.

61
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,600
First off, thank you very much.

62
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,900
Second off, I know
exactly what you're doing.

63
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,500
You're complimenting me
so you'll get your way.

64
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,300
I invented this move.

65
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,000
Dad, I know you hate Ryan,
but he's different now.

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,200
He's more mature and he's even
been supporting himself.

67
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,600
Oh, yeah? Doing what?

68
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,300
Doesn't matter.

69
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,300
He's a drug dealer, right?

70
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
No.

71
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,000
He was recently a jouster
at the Renaissance Faire.

72
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,500
So he actually lowered the bar.

73
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,200
Earl. Your work
was exceptional this year.

74
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,000
Have a ham.

75
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,400
Okay. Stuart.

76
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,400
I've never seen
a shoddier performance.

77
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,200
Have a ham.

78
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,800
Hi, Mike.

79
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,600
You know, I don't think
this socialist ham giveaway

80
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,500
is a good incentive program.

81
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,500
You want to wear the Santa suit?

82
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,800
Me in a Santa suit?
I don't think so.

83
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,400
Hey, dad.
Okay. What do you think?

84
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,000
Well, baby, I think you are adorable.

85
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,700
That's what I was afraid of. It is
really hard to look sexy in green felt.

86
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,900
Then you've never seen
miss Sandy Duncan in "Peter Pan."

87
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,500
Yeah.

88
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,400
I can't believe I have to
work for spending money.

89
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,100
- Ugh. It's so work-y.
- Yeah, yeah.

90
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,400
Listen, your job here is to
spread holiday cheer and help out

91
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,600
<i>and</i> also get kids to sit
in angry Santa's lap here.

92
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,600
But only after
they've voided their bladders--

93
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,300
also your responsibility.

94
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,400
All right, Mr. Claus.
I'll do my best.

95
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,400
Oh, Mr. Claus is my father.
Just call me Santa.

96
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,800
All right, Santa. I will try
not to disappoint you.

97
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,000
I have complete faith in you.

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,100
Oh, that's what everyone
always says at first.

99
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,200
- Hey, Mr. B.?
- Yep.

100
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,900
- I just want to warn you about Ryan.
- Oh, I know he's back,

101
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,200
but you don't need
to feel threatened about that.

102
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,500
I'm not threatened.

103
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,600
My voice got all high.

104
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,800
I'm clearly threatened.

105
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,100
I'm telling you, Kristin's not
gonna leave you for the guy.

106
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,100
I didn't think she was. Why would
you even put that in the air?

107
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,600
'Cause he's a slick, smooth,
you know, good-looking jerk.

108
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,800
You find him good-looking?

109
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,400
Do you find me good-looking?

110
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,500
Well, legally, as your boss,
I'm not allowed to even answer that.

111
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,700
Hey, Mike. Hey.
Can you give me a sec?

112
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,800
I was gonna tell you.
Ryan's in your office.

113
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,400
Sorry about that.
I'm selling a sword on Craigslist.

114
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,000
Give me one reason why I
shouldn't throw you out that window.

115
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,500
Because I came to have
a man-to-man talk with you,

116
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,300
and that won't work
if I'm in the air screaming.

117
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,200
Look, I want to be in Boyd's life.
I want to see him for Christmas.

118
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,400
And I want to be a point guard
for the nuggets.

119
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,700
Look, I know I screwed up,
but I'm his dad, and I'm back.

120
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,400
Until jousting season?

121
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,200
Technically, it's not seasonal.
It's at the pleasure of the King.

122
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,700
You left my daughter and your son.

123
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,000
I know. I was working.
I had a lot of jobs.

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,900
I was a singing waiter
on a cruise ship,

125
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,800
and now I'm the senior knight
at the Ren Faire.

126
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,000
And a couple months ago, I was sitting
there at the head of the round table--

127
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,600
hey, whoa, walk me through that.

128
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,800
Head of a round table--
how does that work?

129
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,300
And I realized I'm at the top of
my game in every way but one--

130
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,400
being a dad.

131
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,700
Wow, that's a--that's
a good smile you got there.

132
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,800
Bet that really works
on the girls, doesn't it?

133
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,000
Well, you know...

134
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,300
Sounds like your acting career
is--is really taking off.

135
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,400
Thank you.

136
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,100
But the--the role
of Boyd's, uh, father

137
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,200
should have been cast
two and a half years ago.

138
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm sorry.
How's this going in here?

139
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,100
'Cause I'm kind of
inside my head out there.

140
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,600
*****

141
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,700
- Cheese!
- Oh!

142
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,500
Okay. Next.

143
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,900
That's wonderful.
Thank you, thank you.

144
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,200
Well, well, well.
Aren't you adorable?

145
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,100
- What's your name?
- Jack.

146
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,700
I was talking to your mother.

147
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,100
Okay, all right, okay, here we go.

148
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,200
Now move along.
Up on Santa's lap.

149
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,700
- There we go.
- There you go, all right, come on.

150
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,400
- Here's the picture. Smile there.
- Okay? Say, "cheese."

151
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,600
Cheese.

152
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,600
- There you go.
- Okay. Good job. Next!

153
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,800
No, no, actually,

154
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,000
Santa's gonna warm himself up
with a little Irish coffee.

155
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,900
Hold the coffee.
Be back in ten.

156
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,700
good idea. I-I could
use a break, too.

157
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,900
Yeah, you'll get a break.
It's called January to November.

158
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,500
But I've been on my feet all day.

159
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,700
You try walking around in these
pointy, uncomfortable shoes.

160
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,400
Don't talk to me
about uncomfortable shoes.

161
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,800
I didn't own a pair of shoes
till I was 12.

162
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,300
My mother used to paint laces
on my socks,

163
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,400
and nobody was fooled, by the way.

164
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,200
All right, everybody, back to work.
I want this place swept up

165
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,300
and all the candy cane baskets
refilled by the time I get back.

166
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,700
- All right?
- That's not fair.

167
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,400
Scrooge.

168
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,400
Hey, you can't talk
to Santa like that.

169
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,200
Um, he's not actually Santa Claus.

170
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,900
- What?!
- Nothing.

171
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,300
Look, just because we're playing
Santa's little helpers

172
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,100
doesn't mean
we don't have any rights.

173
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,600
Don't make any trouble.

174
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,700
He knows when we've been bad or good.

175
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,700
Wait a second. We get paid, like,
nothing-- no breaks, no benefits.

176
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But this is the way it's always been.

177
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,500
You mean the way
it's always used to been.

178
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,000
Okay, kiddies.
Santa's back.

179
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,300
Where the hell is everybody?

180
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,000
******

181
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,300
Elves.

182
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,100
What about us?

183
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,900
Come on, people.
Back to work.

184
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
We're not gonna do anything around
here until we get some rights.

185
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,900
Sweet Mandy,
am I understanding right?

186
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,400
You're unionizing the elves?

187
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,300
Yes, Mr. Alzate.
We are all in this together.

188
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,500
It is no longer
every elf for his... elf.

189
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,400
Well, thanks a lot, dad.

190
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,200
I heard Ryan came by your work to
apologize, and you were mean to him?

191
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,300
"Mean to him"? What's he, 6?

192
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,400
I wasn't mean.
I was clear with him.

193
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,300
And listen, I work
at a store filled with guns,

194
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,400
and he left with the same amount
of holes he walked in there with.

195
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,100
Look, he's trying to apologize,
and he wants to see Boyd for Christmas.

196
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,900
- You can't hold a grudge forever.
- Oh, yeah, I can.

197
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,100
I'm still angry that those
hippies remade "true grit."

198
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,400
Did you understand
anything they said?

199
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,000
"Sheriff, what you
doing over here? Come on now."

200
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,400
???
"That leg gonna have to come off."

201
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,100
Dad, I was sort of thinking,
you know,

202
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,400
you make everyone go to church every week
and listen to sermons about forgiveness.

203
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,800
So?

204
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,100
So... maybe you should
just forgive Ryan.

205
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,400
<i>That's</i> what you take away
from church? Forgiveness?

206
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,600
What about the vengeful God?
All that Isaiah stuff, huh?

207
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Rain toads on people.

208
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,000
Rivers into blood,
harden the heart of the Pharaoh.

209
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,900
How come <i>that</i> didn't sink in?
That's my God.

210
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,800
Not mine.

211
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,200
All right. <i>All right.</i>

212
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,300
Nobody is leaving this room
until we get this worked out.

213
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,200
Hmm?

214
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,200
I gotta go.

215
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,700
I'm gonna write an offer
on a piece of paper,

216
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,400
And slide it to you.

217
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Why don't you just
tell me what it is?

218
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,300
It's more dramatic like this.

219
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,800
One free ham.

220
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,800
I don't think so.

221
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,800
- Worth a shot.
- Listen,

222
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,000
Mr. Alzate, you can't break us,
so you might as well just give in.

223
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,800
Well, we'll see about that.
All right, what are your demands?

224
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,700
Right, yes. Um, okay.

225
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,600
"Demand number one..."

226
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,000
"We want a 5% cost-of-living
increase every 6 months."

227
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,800
I see. You understand
your job ends in three days?

228
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,900
I was not aware of that.

229
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,700
All right. Next demand.

230
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:37,300
Given this new information...Some of
these things might not apply as much.

231
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,800
- Mm-hmm.
- So, um...

232
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,300
Clothing allowance,
company car, um...

233
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,600
Okay, right, yes.

234
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,700
10-minute break every hour.

235
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,400
Well, in the spirit of
Christmas, I'll give you five.

236
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,400
In the spirit of Christmas,
we'll take it.

237
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,000
There you go.

238
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,900
Yes! I just totally negotiated!

239
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,800
Well, we got to get back out. There are
lots of kids waiting, hundreds of kids.

240
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,600
Oh, no. I'm exhausted.
I can't go through this no more.

241
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,700
- And their moms.
- Let's go.

242
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,900
Well, Boyd's crashed out.

243
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,900
Dad, why would you let him have an enormous
chocolate reindeer an hour before dinner?

244
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,700
In my defense,
I thought that thing was hollow.

245
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,000
Kyle's here.
He brought a plant.

246
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,700
Hey, Mrs. B.
This is for you.

247
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,700
Oh, thank you, Kyle. That is
very thoughtful and special.

248
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,600
The gravy is congealing.
Let's eat.

249
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,600
- Come on, everybody. Eat.
- Who wants to say grace?

250
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,900
I will. Can I?

251
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,200
- Sure.
- Yeah, sure, honey.

252
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,700
- Well, that's quite a show.
- Wow. Isn't that ni--

253
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,400
- Very nice.
- Mandy's gonna say grace.

254
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,300
- Okay.
- All right. I like that.

255
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,100
- Hit it.
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

256
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,300
Dear lord, we are all so thankful

257
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,400
to be gathered here
on this special day.

258
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,500
And we're also thankful for the
longer holiday hours at the mall...

259
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,200
For diet soda,

260
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,400
and... for my beautiful skin
and for making me so popular.

261
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,900
Okay, all right, all right,
all right, all right--

262
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,600
- Amen. That was...
- Amen.

263
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,200
Right from the heart.
That's nice.

264
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,500
Uh, anybody else
want to say anything?

265
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,100
Uh, actually,
I have something to say.

266
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,100
- Great.
- Okay. Go ahead, Kyle.

267
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,800
Kristin,
you are super important to me...

268
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,700
- That's great.
- And I-

269
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,300
I don't want to ever lose you,

270
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,000
and that's why the following
thing is about to happen.

271
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,100
What? Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

272
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,400
- Kristin Marie Baxter...
- Whose middle name's Beth.

273
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,500
I know we've only known
each other a short time...

274
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,600
No.

275
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,800
Hang on. You don't know
where this is headed.

276
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,300
Will you marry me?

277
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,300
No.

278
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,500
I don't know what I'm supposed to do,

279
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,400
'cause in my head,
we were already kissing.

280
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,300
You know, we should--
we should go outside and talk.

281
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,600
Just give us-- give us a minute?

282
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,300
Oh, my God.
I have got to see this.

283
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,800
This is gonna be so good, you know?

284
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,700
Like one of those
Spanish soap operas...

285
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,100
Where you can't understand
what they're saying,

286
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,600
but everything's
really desperate and sad.

287
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,100
Hey, can anybody but me go get that?

288
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,700
Hi, Mrs. Baxter.
This is for you.

289
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,000
Of course it is.

290
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,000
What, uh, what are you doing here?

291
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,400
I wanted to drop off
this Christmas gift for Boyd.

292
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,900
Who's at the door?

293
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,700
I'm gonna ask you something,
and, uh, it--it--

294
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,900
if it seems sarcastic,
it's not meant to be, but, uh,

295
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,900
do you have a death wish?

296
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,500
It's Christmas. I'm sure Mike
will be cool with me being here.

297
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,000
- Yeah.
- Hey, honey, where's my carving knife?

298
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,200
Uh, I...

299
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,800
I-I-I don't know, sweetheart.
H-hang on.

300
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,600
this might be a good time
to do what you do best--flee.

301
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,700
Kyle, can you put that away?

302
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,000
I just had to cancel
a balloon delivery.

303
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,100
Okay, look, look, I-I get--
I get what's going on,

304
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,100
but you shouldn't feel threatened
just because Ryan's back in town.

305
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,100
- I shouldn't?
- No. No, no, no, look,

306
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,800
I want him to be
a part of Boyd's life.

307
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,200
Okay?
Not my life, Boyd's life.

308
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,900
So what about us?

309
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,400
I like that
we're taking things slowly.

310
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,900
So keep the ring...

311
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,400
For now.

312
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,000
You know, I'd still like
a Christmas present, just...

313
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,700
You know, something
a little less life-changing.

314
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,900
I was gonna give this
coffee gift card to the mailman.

315
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,700
See? This--this is perfect.

316
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,400
They make smoothies, too.

317
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,500
I think we have to
go back in there.

318
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,900
I'm a little embarrassed.

319
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,400
No one's gonna remember.

320
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,300
The important thing
is that you are my boyfriend,

321
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,300
and nobody is taking your place.

322
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,200
Hey, Kris. What up?

323
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,200
Uh, uh, surprise.

324
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,800
- Ryan's here?
- And he's sitting in my chair.

325
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,900
And he's eaten all your porridge.

326
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,800
Honey? The knife was
out by the sharpener.

327
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,000
Yeah, I...

328
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,400
I'm gonna go get the first aid Kit.

329
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,000
Listen... what the hell?

330
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,900
You show up at my place
of worship, then my job,

331
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,600
now my house. What next? Trunk of my car?
Might not be a bad idea.

332
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,400
I'm starting to feel uncomfortable.

333
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,800
This from the guy who spends
half the year in a codpiece.

334
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,200
Codpiece. That's funny.
How do you know about codpieces?

335
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,900
Look, you have no reason to
believe I'll do the right thing,

336
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,400
and if you tell me to leave now,
you won't ever see me again,

337
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,200
but I'm just asking
for a little compassion...

338
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,900
And maybe a little forgiveness.

339
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,400
Jeez.

340
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,100
"Forgiveness"--that word
keeps biting me in the ass.

341
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,200
Hey, dad, remember
the Christmas truce story?

342
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,400
What about it?

343
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,700
The one you tell every year
about the Germans and the French?

344
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm not telling that.
It's German and the British, by the way.

345
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Okay, well, I'm gonna tell.
Everybody sit down.

346
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,700
Sit down.
Ryan, you sit over there.

347
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,400
Everybody sit down. Okay.

348
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,900
It was the winter of 1912.

349
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,900
1914.

350
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,400
1914...

351
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,600
- In France.
- Belgium.

352
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,700
- I'll--sit down. I'll tell the story.
- Okay.

353
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,500
It was, um, it was world war I--

354
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,100
trench warfare between
the Germans and the British,

355
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,100
and it was particularly violent.
Thousands of men died.

356
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,500
It was horrible fighting,
but one Christmas,

357
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,700
these hated enemies decided
to, uh, exchange gifts,

358
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,300
stop shooting each other.

359
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,800
And, um, and they called it a...

360
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,000
A Christmas truce.

361
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,200
A lot of those soldiers had syphilis.

362
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,900
So are you offering me a truce,
Mr. Baxter?

363
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,400
- Yes, I am.
- So, dad...

364
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,500
Can he stay for dinner?

365
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,600
So I g-- I guess he can, yeah.

366
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,700
Cool.
Can I have a drumstick?

367
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,200
Right away you gotta push it.
Right away you push it.

368
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,200
I'll get a plate.

369
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,000
Remember, the truce
only lasted 24 hours.

370
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,300
Then they went back
to bayoneting each other.

371
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,100
- Thank you, dad.
- You're welcome.

372
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,400
I'm proud of you.

373
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,400
See, this is what
Christmas is all about.

374
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,800
So where's Boyd?

375
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,300
My dad gave him a chocolate
reindeer, and he crashed out.

376
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,300
Yeah, Mike, I'd really rather
he didn't have sugar.

377
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,300
- All right, you gotta go.
- Mike.

378
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,900
No, all right, all right,
I just--sit back down.

379
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,100
- Hey, here we are. Hello, everybody.
- Hey, Ed.

380
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,700
Congratulations, Kyle and Kristin.

381
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,000
May your love
grow stronger every year.

382
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,700
Ed, I texted you,
"kill the balloons."

383
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,000
Oh, that was you?

384
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,900
I was terrified.
I had no idea what it meant.

385
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,200
Sit down. Join us.
Come on, sit, sit, sit, sit.

386
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,200
* silent night *

387
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,900
