1
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:07,499
嘿，齿轮都磨掉了。
你让孩子们玩这个了？
Hey, the gears are stripped here.
You Iet the kids pIay with this?

2
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:12,004
是是，孩子们干的，爸
Yeah, yeah, the kids
did that, Dad.

3
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:14,006
跟你每晚上
It had nothing
to do with you

4
00:00:14,006 --> 00:00:16,133
大屁股一坐没关系
pIopping your jumbo can
in there every night.

5
00:00:17,343 --> 00:00:20,137
啊，这下好了
Ah-hh, there we go.

6
00:00:21,672 --> 00:00:23,966
- 嘿
- 嘿。嘿
- Hey
- Hey. Hey.

7
00:00:23,966 --> 00:00:26,052
- 嗨
- 这是爱丽卡
- Hi.
- This is Erica.

8
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:28,596
唔，你好呀
WeII, heIIo there.

9
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:33,184
- 罗伯特叔叔！罗伯特叔叔！
- 嘿，小猴子们！
- UncIe Robert! UncIe Robert!
- Hey, you IittIe monkeys!

10
00:00:33,225 --> 00:00:35,936
嗨，跟爱丽卡问好
Hi, say heIIo to Erica.

11
00:00:35,978 --> 00:00:37,897
我听说了你们很多事情
I've heard so much
about you.

12
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:40,232
你一定是爱丽了。
然后……
You must be AIIy.
And...

13
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:43,319
这一定是杰弗里
还有麦克
this must be Geoffrey
and MichaeI.

14
00:00:43,361 --> 00:00:44,987
罗伯特跟我说了雀斑分布的区别
Robert toId me
about the freckIe patterns.

15
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:47,907
还有个简单的办法。
杰弗里，举手
There's an easier way to teII.
Geoffrey, raise your hand.

16
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:49,909
这是杰弗里了
That's Geoffrey.

17
00:00:53,204 --> 00:00:55,164
事实上，我们正要去打保龄
ActuaIIy, we were
on our way to go bowIing,

18
00:00:55,206 --> 00:00:56,582
可爱丽卡想见见孩子们
but Erica wanted
to meet the kids.

19
00:00:56,624 --> 00:00:58,167
- 嗨
- 嘿，黛比
- Hi.
- Hey, Deb.

20
00:00:58,209 --> 00:01:00,461
- 这是爱丽卡
- 嗨
- This is Erica.
- Hi.

21
00:01:00,503 --> 00:01:03,255
我是玛丽，罗伯特的母亲。
你们俩在约会？
I'm Marie, Robert's mother.
Are you two dating?

22
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:04,882
妈……？
Ma...?

23
00:01:04,924 --> 00:01:07,510
- 我们上星期刚认识的
- 在埃默森储蓄所
- We just met Iast week.
- At Emerson's Savings.

24
00:01:07,551 --> 00:01:10,763
喔，开个支票户头，
免费的姑娘就到手了
Wow, open a checking account,
get a free girI.

25
00:01:10,805 --> 00:01:13,057
我也要去
I'm going down there.

26
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:16,060
对不起，
我是最后的了
Sorry,
I was the Iast one.

27
00:01:17,019 --> 00:01:19,271
这位有幽默细胞
This one's got
a sense of humor.

28
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:22,191
嘿，要不你星期六上我的生日聚会来吧
Hey, why don't you come
to my birthday party Saturday?

29
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:25,152
- 唔？
- 来吧，我的生日
- WeII?
- Come on, it's my birthday.

30
00:01:25,194 --> 00:01:27,446
我说了算，
谁被邀请了……
I get to say
who's invited and...

31
00:01:27,446 --> 00:01:29,407
谁没有
who's not.

32
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:34,537
尽管说出来吧，弗兰克
Just say the word,
Frank.

33
00:01:36,997 --> 00:01:39,834
我5岁。
你多大？
I'm five.
How oId are you?

34
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:42,211
22岁
22.

35
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,175
太老了
That's oId.

36
00:01:50,553 --> 00:01:53,180
好了，快走，爱丽卡。
我想早点去球道
AII right, come on, Erica.
I want to get to the Ianes earIy.

37
00:01:53,222 --> 00:01:55,141
他们只有一双18号的鞋
They onIy have one pair
of size 18 shoes.

38
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:57,101
- 好的
- 再见！
- Okay.
- Bye!

39
00:01:57,143 --> 00:02:00,479
- 很高兴见到你们大家
- 再见！玩得开心！
- It was nice meeting you aII.
- Bye! Have fun!

40
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,816
- 来，孩子们，走
- 22？
- Come on, guys, Iet's go.
- 22?

41
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:06,318
- 帅呀！
- 哦――！
- Hot damn!
- Oh--!

42
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,159
我不喜欢，弗兰克。
这样不对
I don't Iike that, Frank.
It's just not right.

43
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,203
- 到底有什么不对了？
- 她太年轻了
- What the heII's not right about it?
- She's much too young.

44
00:02:16,245 --> 00:02:19,540
- 这样才对嘛！
- 哦――
- That's what makes it right!
- Oh--

45
00:02:19,582 --> 00:02:21,292
够了
Stop it.

46
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:24,837
年轻女人追老男人，
原因的只有一个――想挖金
Young women go after oIder men
for one thing-- she's a goIddigger.

47
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,757
妈，他是罗伯特。
拜托
Mom, it's Robert.
Come on.

48
00:02:27,798 --> 00:02:30,134
她想要什么，
他的蒸发器？
What's she after,
his vaporizer?

49
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:32,803
我只是担心我儿子
I'm just concerned
with my son.

50
00:02:32,845 --> 00:02:35,598
他把那姑娘邀请到咱们家
可不是在帮忙
And he's not heIping
by inviting that girI to our house.

51
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:39,185
哦，行了，玛丽。
他先是抓着个意大利的电话号码
Oh, come on, Marie.
First he snags that ItaIian number,

52
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:40,978
现在又是这个
now this.

53
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,815
罗伯特终于做了点让我骄傲的事
Robert's finaIIy doing stuff
I can be proud of.

54
00:02:44,857 --> 00:02:47,109
我要跟他说说
I'm going to have
a word with him.

55
00:02:47,151 --> 00:02:50,029
哦，妈，他们只是――
他们去打保龄。别激动
Oh, Mom, they're just--
they're going bowIing. Just reIax.

56
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:51,655
哦，拜托！
我干吗和男人说？
Oh, pIease!
Why am I taIking to men?

57
00:02:51,697 --> 00:02:53,949
你理解我说的，是不是，
黛比拉？
You understand what I'm saying,
right, Debra?

58
00:02:53,991 --> 00:02:57,286
事实上，玛丽，我想只要能让他幸福，
罗伯特做什么都没关系
WeII, actuaIIy Marie, I think Robert
shouId do whatever makes him happy.

59
00:02:57,328 --> 00:02:59,413
是的，只要他开心
Yeah, whatever
makes him happy.

60
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,417
我不会让这种事情发生的
WeII, I'm not going
to Iet that happen.

61
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:12,551
- 都睡下了？
- 罗伯特是头蠢驴
- Everybody sIeeping?
- Robert is a jerk.

62
00:03:14,095 --> 00:03:15,888
哈？
Huh?

63
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,641
真不敢相信他和一个22岁的人约会！
I can't beIieve he's dating
a 22-year-oId!

64
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:23,270
那“只要能让他幸福”是怎么回事？
What happened
to ''whatever makes him happy''?

65
00:03:23,312 --> 00:03:26,148
我说谎的！
I was Iying!

66
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,486
总之，那不是真正的幸福
Anyway, that's not
reaI happiness.

67
00:03:31,487 --> 00:03:33,406
我不知道。
我想那可能是的
I don't know.
I think it might be.

68
00:03:35,032 --> 00:03:38,869
得了吧，雷。
他们能聊些什么呢？
Come on, Ray. What couId
they possibIy have to taIk about?

69
00:03:38,911 --> 00:03:40,329
我――
I--

70
00:03:40,371 --> 00:03:42,748
也许他们用不着聊天。
也许他们是那种……
Maybe they don't have to taIk.
Maybe they're the...

71
00:03:42,748 --> 00:03:46,669
不用时常聊天的一对
they're the kind of coupIe
that doesn't have to... taIk constantIy.

72
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:54,510
严肃点，雷
I'm serious,
Ray.

73
00:04:00,015 --> 00:04:01,851
你还记得罗伯特进警队第一年吗？
Do you remember Robert's
first year on the force?

74
00:04:01,892 --> 00:04:04,311
还记得他在车后座给小孩接生吗？
Remember when he heIped deIiver
a baby in the back of that cab?

75
00:04:04,353 --> 00:04:07,023
- 那可能就是爱丽卡！
- 唔，那样――
- That couId be Erica!
- WeII, that...

76
00:04:07,064 --> 00:04:10,609
- 那可以是他们聊天的话题
- 不
- that's something they can taIk about!
- No.

77
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:14,613
他不可能是认真地对待这种恋爱关系的！
他在利用她
He can't possibIy be serious
about this reIationship! He's using her.

78
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:16,490
嘿，要是你这么在乎，
Hey, if this bothers you so much,

79
00:04:16,532 --> 00:04:18,451
为什么刚才不跟我妈说？
why didn't you speak up
earIier with my mom?

80
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:21,370
因为这不关我的事！
Because it's none
of my business!

81
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,706
我不想像你妈一样！
I don't want to be
Iike your mother!

82
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:29,545
对不起。
我不是生你的气
I'm sorry.
I'm not mad at you.

83
00:04:30,963 --> 00:04:33,632
问你脑袋上的血管相不相信
TeII that to the vein
in your head.

84
00:04:41,891 --> 00:04:44,352
你知道我怎么想的吗？
You know
what I think?

85
00:04:44,393 --> 00:04:47,730
我要是说知道，
你是不是还要告诉我？
If I say yes, do you
stiII have to teII me?

86
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:57,239
我想罗伯特害怕亲近
I think that Robert
is afraid of intimacy.

87
00:04:57,281 --> 00:04:59,241
所以他才让自己
搞出个
So he gets invoIved
in a reIationship

88
00:04:59,241 --> 00:05:01,494
一开始就注定不会有结果的关系
that is doomed
from the beginning.

89
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:04,330
是吗，可是……
这又何苦（《傻女十八变》，有钱寡妇
捐100万给内税局）呢？
Yeah, but...
what a way to go.

90
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,708
嘿，别这样。
不，我的节目
Hey, come on.
No, my thing.

91
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,002
哦，你真的觉得有意思，
是不是？
Oh, you reaIIy think
that's funny, don't you?

92
00:05:10,044 --> 00:05:12,671
“这又何苦”
''What a way to go.''

93
00:05:23,391 --> 00:05:25,476
嘿……
Hey...

94
00:05:25,518 --> 00:05:27,436
你知道，我真的没告诉你……
you know, I reaIIy haven't
toId you...

95
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:29,772
你最近多好看
how good you've
been Iooking IateIy.

96
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:33,818
什么？
What?!

97
00:05:33,859 --> 00:05:35,277
这是真的，不过
ReaIIy, though.

98
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:37,905
就像个性感的妞
You're Iike a hot chick.

99
00:05:37,947 --> 00:05:40,616
哦我的天！
你以为是因为这个？！
Oh my God!
Is that what you think this is about?!

100
00:05:40,658 --> 00:05:42,243
我担心我看起来多年轻？
I'm worried about
how young I Iook?

101
00:05:42,284 --> 00:05:44,286
不！我说的是对错的问题
No! I am taIking about
right and wrong here.

102
00:05:44,328 --> 00:05:47,331
- 起码的得体
- 好吧，可你真的很撩人
- A basic sense of decency.
- Okay, but you do Iook hot.

103
00:05:47,373 --> 00:05:49,667
哦，你准是在开玩笑
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me.

104
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:56,006
能给我遥控器吗？
Can I have
the remote?

105
00:06:06,684 --> 00:06:08,728
哦，你在这。我给你公寓打过电话
Oh, you're here.
I checked your apartment.

106
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:13,274
似的，妈让我替她拿橄榄果盘
准备爸的聚会
Yeah, Ma wanted me to get
her oIive pIate for Dad's party.

107
00:06:13,315 --> 00:06:16,944
喔，橄榄。
这地方有的热闹了
Wow, oIives.
This thing's going to rock.

108
00:06:19,572 --> 00:06:22,241
- 尼和爱丽卡怎么样了？
- 还好，我猜
- So how's it going with you and Erica?
- Okay, I guess.

109
00:06:22,283 --> 00:06:23,576
- 哦，那就好
- 是
- Oh, good.
- Yeah.

110
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:26,704
- 她看来喜欢你
- 是的，不错吧
- She seems to Iike you.
- Yeah, how about that?

111
00:06:26,746 --> 00:06:28,998
是
Yeah.

112
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,292
认真的？
Is it serious?

113
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,419
不知道。
我们才出去过几次
I don't know.
We've onIy gone out a few times.

114
00:06:33,461 --> 00:06:36,422
是。你觉得会成为正式的吗？
Yeah. You think it's
going to get serious?

115
00:06:36,464 --> 00:06:38,758
谁知道呢？
我们在一起挺好玩的，就这样
Who knows?
We're just having fun, that's aII.

116
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:41,427
很好。
你知道什么最好玩？
Good. You know what
might be the most fun?

117
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:43,596
和她分手
Breaking up
with her.

118
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:46,891
什么？你说什么呢？
What? What are you
taIking about?

119
00:06:46,932 --> 00:06:48,893
听着，如果你和她在一起开心，
Listen, if you're
just having fun with her,

120
00:06:48,934 --> 00:06:50,895
就不该把她带着来
you shouIdn't bring her
around here.

121
00:06:50,895 --> 00:06:53,856
我是说，这是埋葬一切开心的地方
I mean, this is where
fun goes to die.

122
00:06:58,611 --> 00:07:01,113
什么？我们在这很开心。
她让爸笑个不停
What? We had fun here.
She made Dad Iaugh.

123
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:03,908
是吗，说不定是笑气吧
Yeah, that couId
have been gas.

124
00:07:03,908 --> 00:07:07,828
要是笑气的话，
他还能合得上嘴吗？
Yeah, weII if it was gas,
he wouId never stop Iaughing.

125
00:07:11,707 --> 00:07:13,626
看……
Look...

126
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:17,671
这让我生不如死，
好吗？
it's making my Iife heII,
aII right?

127
00:07:17,713 --> 00:07:19,965
让你生不如死？
怎么会？
Making your Iife heII?
How?

128
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:25,054
你……和一个年轻姑娘约会……
You... dating
a younger girI...

129
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:27,014
影响到其他人
affects other peopIe.

130
00:07:27,056 --> 00:07:28,974
特别是年纪大的人
EspeciaIIy oIder peopIe

131
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:31,686
比如我娶的那位
Iike the one
I'm married to.

132
00:07:31,727 --> 00:07:35,398
- 黛比拉又不老
- 有爱丽卡在她就老了
- Debra's not oId.
- She is when Erica's in the room.

133
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:37,358
是的，可是黛比拉好像很喜欢
爱丽卡，而且――
Yeah, but Debra
seemed to Iike Erica and--

134
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,360
是啊是啊。
她是的，不是吗？
Yeah, yeah.
She did, didn't she?

135
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,279
她在边上很开心――
She was pIeasant,
enjoyabIe to be around--

136
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:44,490
让我告诉你点事吧。
事实上有两个黛比拉
Iet me teII you something.
There's two Debras.

137
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:46,325
没错
That's right.

138
00:07:46,325 --> 00:07:49,328
你看到的那个黛比拉对这没意见
There's the Debra you see
that doesn't have a probIem with it.

139
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:53,124
然后，等大家都走了，
我见到的那个黛比拉――
Then, when everybody Ieaves,
there's the Debra that I see--

140
00:07:53,165 --> 00:07:55,084
达斯（《星球大战》里的达斯・维达）
・黛比拉
Darth Debra.

141
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,258
是吗，可是她看起来不――
Yeah, but she
doesn't seem so--

142
00:08:02,299 --> 00:08:04,552
嘿，嘿，嘿。
还记得你和艾米分手的时候吗？
Hey, hey, hey. Remember
when you broke up with Amy?

143
00:08:04,593 --> 00:08:06,554
是的，她对我很生气，
然后就没事了
Yeah, she got mad at me
and then it was over.

144
00:08:06,595 --> 00:08:08,514
对你没事了！
因为你走了
Over for you!
Because you Ieft.

145
00:08:08,556 --> 00:08:12,184
我的听觉刚刚才恢复！
I'm just now getting
my hearing back!

146
00:08:13,144 --> 00:08:16,063
- 真的吗？
- 是的，是的
- ReaIIy?
- Yes, yes.

147
00:08:16,105 --> 00:08:19,108
而现在你带了个22岁的
And then you bring
a 22-year-oId around.

148
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:22,737
我会变成个孤独、耳背、央求性生活的人
I'm going to be a IoneIy,
deaf sex-beggar.

149
00:08:28,784 --> 00:08:32,371
这么说你是说真的了？
有两个黛比拉？
So you're serious?
There's two Debras?

150
00:08:33,372 --> 00:08:34,457
对头
Yep.

151
00:08:34,498 --> 00:08:37,168
没一个是会做饭的
And neither one of them
can cook.

152
00:08:41,547 --> 00:08:43,716
所以你看，我是说……
So Iook, I mean...

153
00:08:43,758 --> 00:08:46,510
你知道，看开点
you know,
just be cooI.

154
00:08:46,552 --> 00:08:49,138
我是说，好好开心，只是……
I mean,
have fun, but...

155
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:52,099
别在这开
just have it...
away from here.

156
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:55,353
好吧，雷蒙德。
我想我理解
AII right, Raymond.
I think I understand.

157
00:08:55,394 --> 00:08:57,646
谢谢，兄弟。
谢谢
Thank you, man.
Thank you.

158
00:08:57,688 --> 00:09:00,316
嘿，如果是我的话，你让她在这
光着游行都可以
Hey, if it was up to me, you couId
parade her around here naked.

159
00:09:00,358 --> 00:09:02,777
我不会说个不字
I wouIdn't say boo.

160
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:07,531
- 我一点都不介意――
- 我理解。我理解
- I wouIdn't mind at aII--
- I understand. I understand.

161
00:09:07,573 --> 00:09:09,533
好的
Okay.

162
00:09:11,327 --> 00:09:14,038
弗兰克？
别吃蛋糕！
Frank? Don't eat
that cake!

163
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,165
怎么了？你吼什么吼？
What? What the heII
are you yeIIing about?

164
00:09:16,207 --> 00:09:18,876
你犯什么病？
这是聚会用的
What is wrong with you?
That's for the party.

165
00:09:18,876 --> 00:09:21,962
是我过生日。
看看这的名字
It's my birthday.
Look at the name there.

166
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,884
大家好
HeIIo, everybody.

167
00:09:26,926 --> 00:09:29,011

- 嘿，雷蒙德

168
00:09:29,053 --> 00:09:30,596
我想你还记得爱丽卡
I'm sure
you remember Erica.

169
00:09:30,638 --> 00:09:33,349
是的，当然。
保龄妹妹
Yeah, I sure do.
The bowIer.

170
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:34,767
嗨，雷
Hi, Ray.

那么，呃……

哦，你好，爱丽卡

牛奶怎么样？
WouId you Iike something to drink?

176
00:09:53,369 --> 00:09:54,954
哦，不用了，谢谢。
我很好
Oh, no thanks.
I'm fine.

177
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:57,289
生日快乐，爸。
这是我和爱丽卡送的
Happy birthday, Dad.

178
00:09:57,331 --> 00:09:59,583
谢谢你了，爱丽卡
Why thank you,

180
00:10:02,253 --> 00:10:03,879
弗兰克！

181
00:10:03,921 --> 00:10:05,881
该坐下了！
It's time to sit!

182
00:10:05,923 --> 00:10:08,551
我给你做了蛋糕！
I made you

183
00:10:08,592 --> 00:10:13,013
需要帮你坐下吗？
WouId you Iike some heIp

184
00:10:13,055 --> 00:10:15,891
我妻子在搞笑呢
My wife makes a joke.

185
00:10:15,933 --> 00:10:18,936
来，爱丽卡，过来。
你可以坐在今晚主角的边上
Here, Erica, come.
You can sit by the man of the hour.

186
00:10:22,565 --> 00:10:24,525
搞什么呢，老兄？
黛比拉就要来了！
What the heII, man?
Debra's going to be right back!

187
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:28,446
哦，得了吧，雷蒙德。
我想过你的故事了――两个黛比拉
Oh, come on, Raymond.
I thought about your story-- two Debras.

188
00:10:28,487 --> 00:10:30,531
我看只有一个嫉妒的兄弟
AII I see is one
jeaIous brother.

189
00:10:30,573 --> 00:10:33,200
什么？我才没嫉妒你呢。
你干吗这么对我？
What? I'm not jeaIous of you.
What are you doing to me?

190
00:10:33,242 --> 00:10:35,619
- 我说的是事实
- 我来告诉你事实
- I was teIIing the truth.
- I'II give you the truth.

191
00:10:35,661 --> 00:10:38,622
我碰巧约会的是个美妙、
出色的年轻姑娘
I happen to be going out
with a wonderfuI, terrific, young woman

192
00:10:38,664 --> 00:10:41,542
并且“呐呐呐呐呐呐”
and ''na-na
na-na-na-na.''

193
00:10:43,627 --> 00:10:47,131
嘿，嗨，爱丽卡。
真高兴又见到你。你好呀

197
00:10:56,599 --> 00:11:00,478
我是不会坐他们边上的。
我不需要看着罗伯特割她的肉
I'm not sitting next to them. I don't
need to watch Robert cut her meat.

198
00:11:01,979 --> 00:11:04,732
爱丽卡，你身上这股
天堂般的香味是什么？
Erica, what is that heavenIy scent
you're wearing?

199
00:11:04,774 --> 00:11:06,233
我来猜猜
Let me guess
what it is.

200
00:11:06,317 --> 00:11:10,279
好了，弗兰克。
我们不能在客人身上乱嗅
AII right, Frank.
We don't sniff the guests.

201
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:13,032
- 我在聊天呢！
- 你在丢自己的脸！
- I'm having a conversation!
- You're embarrassing yourseIf!

202
00:11:13,074 --> 00:11:16,744
而你在丢我的脸！
别人还以为你是我什么人呢！
And you're embarrassing me!
PeopIe think I'm with you!

203
00:11:18,662 --> 00:11:21,499
- 你想让我走吗？
- 这是个不错的生日礼物
- You want me to Ieave?
- There's a birthday present.

204
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,085
生日快乐，弗兰克
Happy birthday, Frank.

205
00:11:24,126 --> 00:11:26,670
你现在可以正式成为
糟老头子了
You are now officiaIIy
a dirty oId man.

206
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:30,466
- 你把那个拿哪去？
- 你不配吃我的食物
- Where are you going with that?
- You don't deserve my food.

207
00:11:30,508 --> 00:11:33,719
那你以为我呆在这是为什么？
我去共济会了！
What the heII do you think I stay
around here for?! I'II go to the Iodge!

208
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:35,262
- 好极了！去吧！
- 我走了！
- Good! Go!
- I'm going!

209
00:11:35,304 --> 00:11:37,139
- 好极了！
- 再见！
- Good!
- Goodbye!

210
00:11:37,181 --> 00:11:39,141
很高兴再次见面，爱丽卡
Nice to see you again,
Erica.

211
00:11:47,108 --> 00:11:50,027
嘿，你知道吗，妈？
我们可以吃
Hey, you know what, Ma?
We can eat that.

212
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:52,822
- 你……我带回再跟你说
- 什么？
- You... I'II taIk to you Iater.
- What--?

213
00:11:53,864 --> 00:11:55,950
哦我的天。
我感觉糟透了
Oh my God.
I feeI terribIe.

214
00:11:55,991 --> 00:11:58,077
- 也许我该走了
- 不，别走
- Maybe I shouId go.
- No, don't.

215
00:11:58,119 --> 00:11:59,453
你在这太好了，是不是？
It's great
that you're here, right?

216
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:02,123
当然，不，不是因为你，爱丽卡
Sure, no,
it's not you, Erica.

217
00:12:02,164 --> 00:12:06,043
该死，我本来还想
好好认识认识你呢
WeII, shoot, I was Iooking forward
to getting to know you.

218
00:12:06,085 --> 00:12:08,379
嘿，我有个主意。
咱们可以一起出去吃晚饭
Hey, here's an idea.

219
00:12:08,421 --> 00:12:10,965

220
00:12:11,006 --> 00:12:13,718

223
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:20,057
嘿，你知道吗？
要不就你们几个去吧？
Hey, you know what?
Why don't you guys go without me

224
00:12:20,057 --> 00:12:22,560
因为我真的不太舒服
'cause I'm reaIIy not

225
00:12:22,601 --> 00:12:25,563

- Okay, weII come on, Debra, Iet's go.

226
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:30,359
你怎么了，雷？
你嗓子疼还是怎么？
What's the matter, Ray?
You have a sore throat or something?

227
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:31,902
- 很可能是――

看哪！快看！
Robert! Robert, Iook!
Look! Look!

230
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:42,663
瞧，这地方真不错，是不是？
没有父母。
See, it's a nice pIace, right?
No parents.

Yeah, you didn't Iet me go

235
00:12:55,634 --> 00:12:57,928

太好了
That's great.

241
00:13:27,124 --> 00:13:29,543
是的，我是个幸运的女人
Yeah, I'm
a Iucky woman.

242
00:13:34,632 --> 00:13:37,051
我能问你点事吗？
Can I ask you
something?

243
00:13:37,093 --> 00:13:39,428
因为你对我很好
而且……
It's just that you've been
so nice to me and...

244
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,722
你很有经验
you're so
experienced.

245
00:13:41,764 --> 00:13:44,225
谢谢
Thank you.

246
00:13:45,851 --> 00:13:48,604
罗伯特妈妈……
So, Robert's
mother--

247
00:13:48,646 --> 00:13:50,231
她不喜欢我，是吗？
she doesn't Iike me,
does she?

248
00:13:50,272 --> 00:13:52,191
哦，不，不，不。
她当然喜欢你
Oh, no, no, no.
Sure she does.

249
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:54,318
不，我看得出来
No, I can teII.

250
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,946
因为我太年轻了，是吗？
It's because
I'm too young, right?

251
00:13:56,987 --> 00:13:59,907
- 啊――
- 知道吗，这就是为什么我喜欢罗伯特
- Ah--
- See, that's why I Iike Robert.

252
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:02,201
因为他不介意我的年龄
Because he doesn't have
a probIem with my age.

253
00:14:02,243 --> 00:14:05,162
是的，罗伯特在这方面的确出色
Yeah, Robert's terrific
that way.

254
00:14:07,164 --> 00:14:09,083
我希望他真是那样，
因为……
I hope he
reaIIy is because...

255
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,836
你知道，事实上，
you see, actuaIIy,

256
00:14:11,877 --> 00:14:13,838
我19岁
I'm 19.

257
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,676
什么？
What?!

258
00:14:20,052 --> 00:14:23,264
哦我的天！
这真是疯了！
Oh my God!
This is insane!

259
00:14:23,305 --> 00:14:26,100
- 你什么意思？
- 你几乎还没上完高中
- What do you mean?
- You're bareIy out of high schooI.

260
00:14:26,142 --> 00:14:28,936
你上完高中了吧，是不是？
You are out of high schooI,
aren't you?!

261
00:14:28,978 --> 00:14:32,606
- 是的，一年多了
- 哦，好的，好吧
- WeII yeah, for over a year.
- Oh, okay, aII right.

262
00:14:32,648 --> 00:14:35,568
对不起。
只是……
Sorry.
It's just that...

263
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:37,695
我的天，
你才十几岁！
my God,
you're a teenager!

264
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:46,120
好了，游戏时间到
AII right,
Iet the fun begin.

265
00:14:47,913 --> 00:14:51,250
我饿坏了，我要点一个
一层盖另一层的披萨
I'm so hungry, I'm going to order
a pizza topped with another pizza.

266
00:14:51,292 --> 00:14:53,085
雷
Ray.

267
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,549
没事吧？
Is everything
okay?

268
00:14:58,591 --> 00:14:59,717
很好
Fine.

269
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,095
爱丽卡？
Erica?

270
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:05,139
我不是太饿
I'm not
reaIIy hungry.

271
00:15:05,181 --> 00:15:08,351
- 嘿，我也不饿。你想走吗？
- 是的
- Hey, I'm not hungry. You want to go?
- Yep.

272
00:15:08,392 --> 00:15:11,270
等等，爱丽卡。
别让我父母毁了你的晚上
Wait, Erica. Don't Iet
my parents ruin your evening.

273
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,522
不是你父母
It's not
your parents.

274
00:15:13,564 --> 00:15:16,609
那是为什么？
是雷蒙德？
What is it?
Is it Raymond?

275
00:15:17,818 --> 00:15:19,236
不
No.

276
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:23,074
呃，爱丽卡不太开心，
因为，呃……
Um, Erica's just a IittIe upset
because, um...

277
00:15:23,074 --> 00:15:26,202
她不敢告诉你她19岁
she's afraid to teII you
that she's 19.

278
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:54,063
- 你19岁？
- 哦，乖乖
- You're 19?
- Oh, man.

279
00:15:54,105 --> 00:15:55,898
太震惊了
That is shocking.

280
00:15:57,274 --> 00:15:59,193
我很抱歉，罗伯特。
我本打算告诉你的，
I'm sorry, Robert.
I was going to teII you,

281
00:15:59,235 --> 00:16:01,821
可我怕你不和我出去
but I was afraid that you
wouIdn't go out with me.

282
00:16:01,862 --> 00:16:05,116
19岁？！
19?!

283
00:16:05,157 --> 00:16:07,618
这是不对的。这是不对的
That's not right.
That's not right.

284
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,579
别这样，现在不是差13岁，
Come on, so, instead
of a 1 3-year difference,

285
00:16:10,621 --> 00:16:12,998
而是16岁，可这也不过是个数字罢了
it's 16, but it's stiII
just a number.

286
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,959
等等，等一等。
16岁？
Wait, wait a minute.
16 years?

287
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,294
那罗伯特就是……35了
That wouId make
Robert... 35.

288
00:16:17,294 --> 00:16:18,754
是的
Right.

289
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,551
太无法相信了！
This is unbeIievabIe!

290
00:16:25,511 --> 00:16:27,430
怎么了？
What?

291
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:32,351
罗伯特，你不是35？
Robert,
you're not 35?

292
00:16:33,686 --> 00:16:35,896
- 我40
- 罗伯特！
- I'm 40...
- Robert--!

293
00:16:35,938 --> 00:16:37,648
- 3！
- 43！
- Three!
- 43!

294
00:16:40,776 --> 00:16:42,862
- 哦……
- 是的是的是的，可是爱丽卡
- Oh...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, but Erica,

295
00:16:42,903 --> 00:16:45,531
你知道，就像你说的，
这不过是个数字罢了，不是吗？
you know, Iike you said,
it's just a number, right?

296
00:16:45,573 --> 00:16:47,825
是的，可是……
Yeah, but...

297
00:16:47,867 --> 00:16:50,286
这是个大数
that's a big number.

298
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,915
35？他说我多大？
35? How oId
did he say I was?

299
00:16:54,957 --> 00:16:56,876
- 雷，别添乱
- 37
- Ray, not now.
- 37.

300
00:16:58,127 --> 00:17:00,129
你说我比你老？！
You made me oIder
than you?!

301
00:17:00,171 --> 00:17:03,799
我想我该走了
I think I better go.

302
00:17:03,841 --> 00:17:06,218
不，等等，爱丽卡。
我和你一起走
No, wait, Erica.
I'II come with you.

303
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,638
不，没事的。知道吗？
我给你打电话，罗伯特
No, that's okay. You know what?
I'II caII you, Robert.

304
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,600
嘿，我比他年轻！
我是他弟弟！
Hey, I'm younger than him!
I'm his younger brother!

305
00:17:15,478 --> 00:17:18,189
她会打电话才怪
I'II be surprised
if she caIIs.

306
00:17:21,192 --> 00:17:22,360
我很抱歉，罗伯特
Sorry, Robert.

307
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:24,528
不，你没有。
你高兴着呢
No you're not.
You enjoyed that.

308
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:27,782
- 高兴什么？
- 破坏我的交往
- Enjoyed what?
- Destroying my reIationship.

309
00:17:27,823 --> 00:17:31,243
我从没见人
算加法这么快的
I've never seen anybody
add two numbers so fast.

310
00:17:33,537 --> 00:17:37,124
这不是什么交往。
这是两个人互相隐满年龄
That wasn't a reIationship. That was
two peopIe Iying about their age.

311
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:40,586
这两个人都没意见
直到半路杀出个你！
And neither one of them had a probIem
with it untiI you butted in!

312
00:17:41,629 --> 00:17:42,922
你知道吗，你是对的，雷
You know what,
you're right, Ray.

313
00:17:42,963 --> 00:17:45,758
她是受年轻女人的威胁
She is threatened
by younger women.

314
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,720
- 雷跟你说的？
- 不――没可能的，怎么可能呢
- Ray toId you that?
- N-no way, no way.

315
00:17:51,681 --> 00:17:53,933
我没有受年轻女人威胁。
为什么我要？
WeII, I am not threatened
by younger women. Why shouId I be?

316
00:17:53,974 --> 00:17:56,060
- 我正好是个有吸引力的女人
- 完全同意
- I happen to be an attractive woman.
- Amen to that.

317
00:17:56,102 --> 00:17:57,353
我满腹诗书
I am extremeIy weII-read.

318
00:17:57,395 --> 00:17:59,313
- 我擅长交谈
- 感谢上帝
- I am a good conversationaIist.
- HaIIeIujah.

319
00:17:59,355 --> 00:18:01,232
我很自豪我的年纪，
我从没在这方面撒过谎
I'm proud of my age
and I have never Iied about it!

320
00:18:01,273 --> 00:18:02,566
- 没理由
- 闭嘴，雷！
- No reason to.
- Shut up, Ray!

321
00:18:02,608 --> 00:18:04,151
好吧
AII right.

322
00:18:04,193 --> 00:18:07,238
怎么了？男人必须和比自己年轻
20的女人约会了？
So what is it now? Men have to date
women 20 years younger than they are?

323
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:09,782
雷明天死，我就得和60岁的约会了？
Ray dies tomorrow, I have
to start dating 60-year-oIds?

324
00:18:09,824 --> 00:18:12,118
- 我明天不会死
- 走着瞧
- I won't die tomorrow.
- We'II see.

325
00:18:14,787 --> 00:18:17,039
面对现实吧，罗伯特。
你是中年人了
And face it, Robert.
You're middIe-aged.

326
00:18:17,081 --> 00:18:19,291
嗯？她真的让你觉得年轻了？
Hmm? Does she reaIIy
make you feeI younger?

327
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,086
是的，她是的。
我也喜欢和她在一起
Yes she did.
And I Iiked being with her.

328
00:18:22,128 --> 00:18:24,839
每次我们出去，
我们坐在车里，感觉好极了
Whenever we'd go out,
we'd get in the car and it feIt great.

329
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,717
她打开电台，
调到她的台
She'd put on the radio and she'd tune
into one of her stations

330
00:18:27,758 --> 00:18:29,885
- 听着嘈杂（拥挤）的音乐
- 你喜欢那个
- with reaIIy jamming music--
- And you Iike that.

331
00:18:29,927 --> 00:18:32,972
- 你喜欢“拥挤”？
- 事实上，是有点太大声了
- You Iike the ''jamming''?
- ActuaIIy, it was a IittIe Ioud for me,

332
00:18:33,014 --> 00:18:35,766
- 可这只是个不好的例子
- 好的，好吧！
- but that was a bad exampIe.
- Okay, fine!

333
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:38,686
说吧！说呀！
说说你哪觉得年轻了？
Go ahead! Go ahead! I'm waiting
for the part where you're younger.

334
00:18:42,648 --> 00:18:44,734
看，罗伯特
Look, Robert,

335
00:18:44,775 --> 00:18:46,694
我知道你觉得寂寞了
I know you get IoneIy,

336
00:18:46,736 --> 00:18:50,656
可是你和那个小姑娘在一起
就没有不舒服吗？
but didn't you feeI a IittIe
uncomfortabIe being with that girI?

337
00:18:53,951 --> 00:18:56,203
她喜欢我
She Iiked me.

338
00:18:56,245 --> 00:18:58,497
我受宠若惊
It was fIattering.

339
00:18:58,497 --> 00:19:01,584
她喜欢和我一聊几个小时
She wanted to taIk
to me for hours.

340
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:05,379
事实上，我煲电话粥的耐力
也不够应付她的
Truth is, I didn't even have
enough phone stamina for her.

341
00:19:15,348 --> 00:19:19,101
她发现我43岁了的时候，
你们看到她眼神了吗？
Did you see the way she Iooked at me
when she found out I was 43?

342
00:19:19,101 --> 00:19:21,395
好像我刚从棺材里坐起来的
Like I just sat up
out of a coffin.

343
00:19:25,858 --> 00:19:28,611
那姑娘还不到咱们一半大
That girI was Iess than
haIf our age.

344
00:19:28,652 --> 00:19:32,531
好了，好了。别再提数字了。
你要杀了我吗？
AII right, aII right. Enough with
the numbers aIready. You're kiIIing me!

345
00:19:33,783 --> 00:19:36,160
她真的认为我比你老？
Did she reaIIy think
I was oIder than you?

346
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:40,039
一只眼都没眨
Didn't bat an eye.

347
00:19:41,665 --> 00:19:43,584
好了，看
AII right, Iook.

348
00:19:43,626 --> 00:19:45,461
点菜吧，
好吗？
Let's just order,
aII right?

349
00:19:48,005 --> 00:19:51,467
来份有熏肉洋葱的披萨吧
Let's get the pizza
with sausage and onions.

350
00:19:51,509 --> 00:19:54,011
洋葱？
几点了？
Onions?
What time is it?

351
00:19:54,053 --> 00:19:57,973
哦，不。
我8点以后不能吃洋葱
Oh, no.
I can't do onions after 8:00.

352
00:19:58,015 --> 00:19:59,850
不，没事的。
我带了Tums（消化药）
No, it's okay.
I got the Tums.

353
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,352
Tums很好用。
里面还加了钙
Tums are good.
They have caIcium.

354
00:20:01,394 --> 00:20:03,771
嘿，你知道我听说什么不错？
Pepcid（消化药）
Hey, you know what I hear is good?
The Pepcid's good.

355
00:20:03,771 --> 00:20:06,440
是的，那个不错。
有水果味的，可以嚼着吃
Yeah, that's good. They have
the fruit fIavor, the chewabIe.

356
00:20:06,482 --> 00:20:08,567
你知道，Mylanta（消化药）
出了夜片了
You know, they have
nighttime MyIanta now.

357
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:11,320
- 晚间Mylanta？
- 真的？是叫酥酥脆吗？
- A nighttime MyIanta?
- ReaIIy? Is it chaIky?

358
00:20:11,362 --> 00:20:13,656
不，叫热带风。
多美的名字
No, tropicaI.
BeautifuI.

359
00:20:16,617 --> 00:20:19,036
你能相信吗？
我又要尿尿了
Can you beIieve this?
I have to pee again.

360
00:20:27,294 --> 00:20:29,588
- 嘿，你在干什么？
- 呃……
- Hey, what are you doing?

没什么，只是，你知道的。
扎个马尾巴

Is that singing supposed
to put me in the mood?

你可得做点什么
<i>#你要是使劲颠上105下#</i>
I got to do something
to get me to shut up.

<i>#如果你真想让她叫出来#</i>
