
1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The last third of the pyramid could not be reached by the main ramp.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Instead a spiral ramp Was used,

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
supported on the stepped sides of the pyramid

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and climbing up With it.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Up this spiral ramp,

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
the most expert stone hauling gangs dragged the final blocks,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
until the very top Was reached.
