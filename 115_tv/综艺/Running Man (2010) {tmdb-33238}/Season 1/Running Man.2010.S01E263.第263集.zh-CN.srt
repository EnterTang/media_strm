00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,950
and says your name

163
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,310
it's game over.

164
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:34,740
What if a citizen is about to...
and I do this?

165
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,670
That's violence, so...

166
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:43,570
- What if they say 'Are you Ji Sang Ryul?'
- Then it doesn't count.

167
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,310
- It has to be your name.
- What if they say 'Are you Jo Woo Jong?'

168
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,610
[100 percent in sync!]

169
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,870
Each person must help five customers.

170
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,940
If there are three customers together,
they count as one group.

171
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:00,340
You pass when you've helped five times.

172
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,770
You have to count
'Grasshopper' for Jae Suk.

173
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,510
And 'Giraffe' as well.

174
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,610
- And Big Nose.
- We have to include our nicknames.

175
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,250
- We'll include Girl's Day.
- As long as they recognize...

176
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,440
- Girl's Day?
- Then X-Teen should be included, too...

177
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:16,090
- X-Teen works, too...
- And Smurf.

178
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,770
[There's Leessang, why are you
bringing up the past...]

179
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,310
Those count.

180
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,910
So, does it count if
they say 'Lee Sung Kyung'?

181
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,160
Pardon?

182
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,510
Their love will never die?

183
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,980
[I should just be quiet...]

184
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,770
When you're done,
you come back upstairs.

185
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:39,440
You'll feel a little upset
if you succeed though.

186
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:43,540
Was I only worth this much?

187
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,490
They don't really stare
at convenience stores.

188
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,460
But more than your face

189
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:52,930
- they recognize your voice.
- My voice is slightly noticeable.

190
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,030
That's true.
You shouldn't talk.

191
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:58,670
[He changed his voice,
but it's a fail...]

192
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,300
Say, 'It's 4,500 won.'

193
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,000
- It's 4,500 won, hello.
- That's it.

194
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,800
[That's more suspicious...]

195
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,400
People really don't know me.

196
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,280
They don't know that it's Lee Dong Wook,
they usually say 'Lee Dong Gook.'

197
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,580
I'm serious.

198
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,250
No way!
Dong Wook!

199
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,350
[Who will win
the convenience store mission?]

200
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,160
[Kim Jong Kook, Ha Ha, Lee Kwang Soo vs.
Ji Suk Jin, Lee Dong Wook, Yoo Jae Suk]

201
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,670
Which one of the three will go first?

202
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,760
I'm the least noticeable one, right?

203
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,130
Your arm...

204
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,010
[His muscles are too big
for scanning bar-codes.]

205
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:40,010
I could just be someone
who likes to work out!

206
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,310
Up to a certain point!

207
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,380
[He's too crazy about working out.]

208
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,880
[First challenger, Kkuk!]

209
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,780
He's going down.

210
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,150
He's already suspicious!

211
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:00,530
His walk is already suspicious!

212
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:04,330
[He arrived at the cash register.]

213
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,170
[His first time working part-time]

214
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:09,230
[at a convenience store.]

215
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,350
- How do I scan?
- First, press this.

216
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,540
[Just then, two female
customers arrived!]

217
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:20,550
[The first customers' visit
made him nervous.]

218
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,350
[He puffs his cheeks up so
that they don't recognize him.]

219
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,730
[Sigh]

220
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,690
[While the two customers
are picking their items...]

221
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,460
You have to act natural.

222
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,760
You don't want them to...

223
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,600
[He's blabbering out of nervousness.]
He's too obvious!

224
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,530
Why does he have
his hands in his pockets?

225
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,770
His hands are awkward.

226
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,270
Just pick your nose instead!

227
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:55,480
It's just Jong Kook.
But if the customers don't look up...

228
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:59,420
They can't imagine that
a celebrity will be here.

229
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,620
He's acting so weird!

230
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,830
[Awkward, awkward]

231
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,940
[I'm so nervous.]

232
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,010
Don't cross your arms!

233
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:14,010
He thinks that he's being casual!

234
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,670
[I'm doing a good job...]

235
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,710
[It's finally check-out time.]

236
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,210
[The distance between
them is fifty centimeters.]

237
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,310
[Will Kkuk be able to handle
the situation, casually?]

238

[Puff]

[They place the items on the counter,
without any suspicion.]

240
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,290
Please call his name!

241
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,660
They might see his arms

242
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,190
and be too scared to look up.

243
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,970
[Just then, she lifts her head up!]

244
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:51,310
[All eyes are on him.]

245
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,810
[He scans the bar-codes
without looking up.]

246
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:03,910
[Will Kkuk fail the mission?]

247
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,140
[Did she recognize Kkuk?]

248
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,940
[She didn't!]

249
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,440
She should have seen him!

250
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,510
Jong Kook can't scan well.

251
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,540
[Scrambling]

252
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,110
Would you like a bag?

253
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,830
That will be 8,900 won.

254
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,140
[He should have said
something after scanning.]

255
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:27,540
He's not talking at all!

256
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,470
[He isn't talking just
in case he gets caught.]

257
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,740
Thank you, come again.

258
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,780
[Eventually, they never found out!]

259
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,580
They didn't recognize him!

260
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,810
[Kkuk passed with his first customer.]

261
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,650
That's cheating!

262
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:45,320
They usually look at
the items or the scanner.

263
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,500
- They don't look at the person.
- I'm like that too.

264
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,560
[Just then!
The second customer is approaching!]

265
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,760
[He approaches without hesitation.]

266
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,940
[He doesn't look.]

267
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,130
I think the other employee
is doing very well.

268
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,370
[Thanks to his over-friendly co-worker]

269
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,480
[Kkuk doesn't have to say a word.]

270
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,810
[He doesn't stare during the check-out]

271
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,840
[or so we thought!]

272
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:17,130
[His eyes are fixed on Kkuk!]

273
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:24,350
[Does Kkuk's challenge end, here?]

274
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:29,390
[He takes his change and leaves.]

275
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,380
[He lets out a big breath
as soon as he leaves.]

276
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,440
It's good, there's a possibility.

277
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:43,370
Wow, this is so interesting.

278
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:47,110
[He finally catches a breath.]

279
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,370
[And another customer walks in, but...]

280
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,870
It's a foreigner!

281
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,490
Wow...

282
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,410
[He's so lucky...]

283
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:04,350
It's foreigner.
Thank goodness.

284
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,880
Hi!

285
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:14,210
[He's fixing his hat?]

286
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,040
[Full of confidence]

287
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,270
[He gets a point for free.]

00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:24,770
[Huh?
He's laughing?]

289
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,770
- I think he recognized him!
- Why did he lift his hat up?

290
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:30,510
[But it's still a foreigner...]

291
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,770
[He can't possibly recognize him...]

292
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:36,110
- It'll be 5,300 won.
- Yes.

293
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,840
Oh, he can speak Korean?

294
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:42,940
[You can tell he has a lot
of experience just by his 'yes.']

295
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,210
- Do you know how to speak Korean?
- Yes.

296
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,770
[He immediately lowered his hat.]

297
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,770
[He pushes his hat down.]

298
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:55,640
[Scramble, scramble]

299
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,520
[Is he taking a picture
with his phone?]

300
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,970
- He needs to take it!
- He's out as soon as he takes it!

301
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,740
He's flustered!

302
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,070
Have a nice day!

303
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,140
- Bye.
- Let's take a picture.

304
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:18,630
[He got caught!]

305
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:24,110
Yay! He was careless!

306
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,510
One moment of carelessness and he failed!

307
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:30,410
Pic... picture...

308
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,440
Just take the picture!
Of course.

309
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,510
[It's not a fail because
he didn't say his name?]

310
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,340
One, two, three.

311
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:42,730
[From his pronunciation to his
selfie pose, he's just so Korean...]

312
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,340
- Fail!
- He didn't say my name!

313
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,750
You're Kim Jong Kook, right?

314
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,840
[The foreigner cleared up
the entire situation.]

315
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,610
How did you know?
Do you work around here?

316
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,010
What kind of work do you do?

317
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:04,110
- I work at a company.
- Really? You speak so fluently.

318
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,170
All right, thank you.

319
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:09,340
[Kkuk, fail]

320
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,740
What were you doing?

321
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,510
[Mr. Capable's shoulders look shabby.]

322
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:16,170
[Ashamed]

323
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:20,910
All foreigners in Gangnam speak Korean.

324
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,070
I was so surprised.

325
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:26,340
[Who knew he would be better
at Korean than Kwang Soo...]

326
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:30,340
I was trying to make it funnier because
he was a foreigner, but he kept laughing.

327
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,910
- Good job.
- He had his camera out.

328
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,840
- Really?
- Yeah.

329
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,540
Good job!
I'm so glad!

330
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,210
I said, 'He didn't say my name!'

331
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:43,610
and he comes back and asks,
'You're Kim Jong Kook, right?'

332
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:46,340
[Kkuk succeeded with two customers.]

333
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,510
[The next challenger is Big Nose.]

334
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:52,710
- Okay, good!
- Don't try to stick out!

335
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,670
I won't!

336
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,610
[The oldest part-timer is]

337
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:03,110
[going to work.]

338
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,010
He's very casual!

339
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:07,270
He looks like the boss.

340
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:10,870
When someone beautiful
walks in, he'll say

341
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,170
'You're so beautiful.'

342
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,970
He can't help himself.

343
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,850
[He's finally at the counter.]
How do you scan?

344
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:24,370
[The newcomer is being taught.]

345
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:31,640
[Less than a minute later,
his first customer arrived.]

346
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,540
[While she isn't paying attention.]

347
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,340
[He changes his face
by puffing up his cheeks.]

348
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:43,510
[Will she recognize him?]

349
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,510
I don't think she knows.

350
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,250
The customers don't
really look up much...

351
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,520
[Her gaze is following Big Nose!]

352
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,850
[Press change, then press cash.]

353
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:58,790
[She seemed like she was looking]

354
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:01,190
[but she turned her head away.]

355
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,960
[Did she see?
I think she saw...]

356
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,270
- Thank you.
- Thank you, come again.

357
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,700
[They left as soon as he was done.]

358
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,200
[Did they not recognize me?]

359
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,110
He's slightly hurt!

360
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:22,810
[He succeeded with his first customer,
but he's sighing for some reason...]

361
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:25,050
- I'm not that recognizable, right?
- Pardon?

362
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,150
- Yes.
- Right?

363
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,020
[Just then, she comes back!]

364
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:35,920
She came back!

365
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,430
[She was finished
with her check-out.]

366
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:41,400
[Why is she back?]

367
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,870
[The woman who didn't recognize me...]

368
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:48,700
[She's coming closer...]

369
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:53,170
[Huh? She isn't interested.]

370
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:55,480
[I'm still hungry.]

371
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,010
[Oh, that's what it was...]

372
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:03,520
[It's a relief, but he
still looks a little sad.]

373
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,090
[Don't cry...]

374
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:11,960
[His second customer
came to buy a drink.]

375
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,800
He's looking!
He's looking!

376
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:22,440
[He's somewhat familiar...]

377
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,870
It's 1,000 won.

378
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:28,470
[Big Nose's face must
be pretty common.]

379
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:31,080
It's 1,000 won.

380
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,410
[An incomplete voice
change just brings sneers.]

381
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,650
Why is he doing that?

382
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:43,720
He shouldn't do that kind of things!
He thinks he sounds perfect!

383
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,190
[His third customer doesn't
show any signs either.]

384
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,430
[The next customer is
waiting for check-out.]

385
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:58,170
[Peek]

386
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:03,840
[He looked!]

387
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,310
[He looks, and looks again.]

388
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,420
[Fixed gaze]

389
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,620
Maybe he's just in a hurry.

390
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:23,060
- A bag, please.
- Yes.

391
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:28,630
- I'll get it for you.
- No, I can get it.

392
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,000
Thank you.

393
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:33,510
[His fourth customer left
without recognizing him.]

394
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,880
I think he just stared
because he was slow.

395
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,450
The way he looked at him was
'What's wrong with this guy...'

396
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:45,350
'Why is he so sluggish?'

397
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,370
[Lift]

398
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:51,470
He lifted his hat up!

399
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,540
Did you see him casually
lifting his hat up?

400
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,760
[He's getting a little restless.]

401
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,730
Hello.

402
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:03,070
[Huh!
This person is...]

403
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:07,910
[The person who is
scanning my sandwich...]

404
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:12,810
[is it him?]

405
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,910
He can't take his eyes off him!

406
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:22,740
Press enter!

407
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:26,010
Please sign here.
It's my first day.

408
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:28,220
It's my first day.

409
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,970
[What's that?]

410
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:33,830
I told him not to do that!

411
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:38,770
[He still doesn't recognize me?]

412
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,940
That will be 2,550 won.

413
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:46,370
Why does he talk like that?

414
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:50,110
- What is he doing?
- I'm not sure...

415
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,710
- Do you need a bag?
- No.

416
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:57,110
- Thank you, come again.
- He's lifting his hat up!

417
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:00,940
- Look at him.
- He's sliding it up slowly.

418
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,970
[Before, After]

419
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,140
Here you go.

420
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:09,970
Are you all together?

421
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:13,970
He keeps talking, on purpose.

422
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,970
He's talking more and more.

423
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:19,570
[By any chance]

424
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:22,240
Are you a celebrity?

425
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:25,240
Are you Ji Suk Jin?

426
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:29,620
[He called his name?]
He said impala before.

427
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,870
[He failed the mission
with a big smile.]

428
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,640
I look like him, right?

429
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:36,710
- Press subtotal.
- Press subtotal.

430
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:41,210
Thank you.
[For recognizing me.]

431
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:44,200
You have a big nose.

432
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:50,640
[He failed, but he feels
good about this situation.]

433
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:54,810
We saw you lifting your hat up!

434
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:58,140
This is what you did.

435
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,410
[Fidget, fidget]

436
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:05,640
As time passes by,
you start to get slightly hurt...

437
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,740
And then he started talking more,
all of a sudden.

438
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,310
I thought I was going to succeed.

439
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:14,240
[The point of this observation was
to see Suk Jin's change of mind.]

440
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:18,870
- The point was his change of mind.
- You do get hurt!

441
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:23,410
After you were caught,
you smiled so big.

442
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:25,970
Ha Ha is just Ha Ha.

443
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,140
[No matter how much he disguises
himself, he's just Ha Ha.]

444
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,210
Ha Ha, please go down quickly
to help more customers.

445
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:34,770
When you go down...
I think you'll get caught going down.

446
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,670
Wearing it is better!

447
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:39,570
- Just be casual!
- I'll go down now.

448
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:42,270
[Ha Ha tries the most casual look.]

449
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,940
Good luck!

450
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,710
He's going!
[He just looks like Ha Ha.]

451
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:52,340
His walking is already so natural.

452
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:58,670
[He casually walks to the counter
as if he usually does.]

453
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:03,310
[He came, but he doesn't know what to do.]

454
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:08,540
- Would you like a bag?
- Yes.

455
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:12,540
[He quickly gets a bag.]

456
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,810
[He places the items in skillfully.]

457

[He's like a professional.]

458

He's good.
Ha Ha's good.

459
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:27,510
[He passed his first customer
so casually.]

460
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:31,040
They're looking at him as they leave.

461
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,970
[A heated gaze that makes him sweat.]

462

[Did Ha Ha fail on his first try?]

463
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,850
[Ha Ha, who didn't even disguise.]

464

[Is it him or not?]

465
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:54,320
[They left!]

466
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,230
That was so risky!

467
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,830
Ha Ha's so good,
he's like an actual part-timer.

468

Ha Ha's great!

469
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:04,800
Instead of sticking out

470
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,630
he's keeping it natural.

471
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,040
[There are still a lot of customers.]

472

[He passed with his second customer.]

474

[He scans the bar-codes, calculates
the subtotal, and takes care of change.]

475
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,760
[He adapted to the part-time job!]

00:35:56,810 --> 00:36:02,580
The other workers are asking
each other who Gary is.

640
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:06,290
Really?
[They're so close, but still don't know.]

641
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:09,690
That's so funny.

642
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:13,200
Even the other workers
ask who that guy is.

643
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,930
They don't know.

644
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:18,970
The customers think it's just his style.

645
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:21,510
What kind of style is that?

646
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,470
Is this 'The Truman Show'?

647
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,710
Maybe everyone there
is making fun of him.

648
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,920
It's not going to be busy
as the convenience store.

649
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,520
- Is anyone here yet?
- Yes, coming!

650
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,520
Number 24...

651
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,760
the beverage you ordered is ready.

652
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:48,500
Number one, your beverage
and bagel are ready.

653
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:52,330
- It's Kang Gary's voice!
- He just spoke!

654
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:57,840
[He didn't even change his voice.]

655
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,510
[The moment of destiny!]

656
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:08,180
[Will he able to give it to
the customer without getting noticed?]

657
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,050
[Oh, he did it!]

658
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:13,050
[He passed the first customer.]

659
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:15,260
That doesn't make a sense!

660
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:18,790
- He's taking it to his table!
- Wow, he has guts!

661
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,330
He's serving.

662
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:27,300
- He saw Gary's face.
- But he doesn't recognize him.

663
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,400
How is this possible?

664
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,640
[It's like he's revealing
that he's Gary.]

665
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:37,680
He talks like a DJ.

666
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:42,370
[They can't imagine it's Gary.]

667
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:46,470
No one knows he's Gary.

668
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,140
Your bagel is here.

669
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,670
He's striking.
This is too weird.

670
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,670
To my eyes, it's obvious.

671
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,670
Doesn't he look like himself
more that I was?

672
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,080
You see guys like him in some cafes.

673
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,040
Number seven, your beverage
and bagel are ready.

674
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,610
That's definitely Gary's voice.

675
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:15,370
- It's his fourth customer.
- Just one more customer, and he's done.

676
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,340
Enjoy.

677
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:21,040
- Wow!
- That's incredible!

678
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,560
[He gets back the buzzer
and gives her the food.]

679
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:32,220
Number nine,
your beverage is ready.

680
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:36,430
[This time, two men walk toward Gary.]

681
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,140
[If he passes through these customers]

682
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:43,550
[he can complete the mission!]

683
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:49,150
[Will he be able to succeed?]

684
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,570
[He doesn't feel out of place at all...]

685
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:01,460
[They don't doubt him at all
and he passes it through.]

686
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:09,270
Gary completes his mission!

687
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:12,840
- This is weird.
- We didn't expect it.

688
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,840
It's weird.

689
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,240
I honestly thought it's too obvious.

690
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,240
You're right.

691
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:25,880
- No one's suspicious.
- It's ridiculous!

692
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,820
The customers are too generous.

693
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,820
This area is really interesting!

694
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,060
Who will try next?

695
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:43,000
Go ahead, Seo Jun.
[The handsome boy, Park Seo Jun]

696
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,670
No one doubted me.

697
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:48,300
Even the workers...

698
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,310
- They don't know who I am.
- They asked who you are.

699
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:55,410
- They think I'm a new worker.
- They asked each other.

700
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:59,380
I forgot this was the mission,
and I was working hard.

701
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:02,480
[Seo Jun is getting ready.]

702
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:04,720
Seo Jun!

703
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:09,250
- It doesn't look like you.
- But you're handsome!

704
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,580
People will look at you.

705
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:14,250
He's handsome, but they won't
be able to tell who he is.

706
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:19,540
[He's wearing a hat and glasses.]

707
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:24,970
Seo Jun walks bravely.

708
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:29,640
I don't know if he'll be able to pass.

709
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,180
[As soon as Seo Jun opens the door]

710

[this place becomes a flower boy cafe.]

[What an eye candy!]

712
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:51,260
Look, the ladies here
started to look at him.

713
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:55,830
These people just said
he looks like Park Seo Jun.

714
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,400
They are looking at him carefully.

715
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:00,770
The three ladies right here...

716
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:05,650
They were served by Gary.

717
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:09,050
They turned around to look at him.

718
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:12,050
People are only interested
in handsome people.

719
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:14,720
[Why are they more excited than him?]

720
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,760
No one will recognize me
even if I work here all day.

721
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,860
See?
They're still looking.

722
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:25,970
- Did he already serve one person?
- Is she an elementary student?

723
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:29,740
He passed through one customer!

724
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:34,040
[It's like an art book
even if he's not posing.]

725
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:39,010
They're searching on the internet
with the keyword 'Park Seo Jun.'

726
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:41,680
They've only searched.

727
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,650
She's pointing a finger at him.

728
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:47,590
She pointed a finger!

[Will his identity be revealed?]

730

But they're not really sure.

731
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,430
Why would he be working here?

732
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:05,570
They would have doubted
if there was a camera around.

733
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:09,640
- They think he looks like him.
- If they ask his phone number...

734
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,910
That'll be funny.

735
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:15,910
I kind of feel sad they look at Seo Jun
as soon as he enters.

736
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:20,820
People still would have looked
even if he wasn't a celebrity.

737

It's natural to look
at beautiful people.

ordered and he take it out.]

00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:08,910
[They might or might not know
even if they wear big name tags.]

798
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:12,070
They wouldn't notice
even if four of us work there.

799
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:17,500
This is shocking.
Can we let Suk Jin do it?

800
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:23,720
They're here. They're whispering.

801
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:28,790
They don't notice at all.

802
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:32,430
- Even when you talk to them.
- Let me see your face.

803
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:35,620
Yura and Ji Hyo spoke as usual.

804
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:38,370
I even asked if the weather is hot.

805
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:40,720
He answered back with 'yes.'

806
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:47,040
Then are we lost?

807
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,670
So the Science Department scored 22...

808
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,680
and the department of
liberal arts scored 19.

809
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,520
The Science Department won.

810
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:02,980
We won, but we're not very happy.

811
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,810
[It's time to go meet the youths.]

812
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:10,920
- We're in team uniforms.
- Now, it feels like Running Man.

813
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,910
You have a choice.

814
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,110
One team will go to
the universities on the east.

815
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:18,350
Sungshin Women's University,
Kyunghee University, and Korea University.

816
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:21,410
The three school are
close to each other.

817
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:24,170
And the other team
will go to the west.

818
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:29,610
Ewha Womans University,
Yonsei University, and Hongik University.

819
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:32,840
I went to Korea University many times.

820
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:37,270
Then you can go to
the schools in west.

821
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:41,040
- Then the Red Team will go to the east.
- We'll do that.

822
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,900
Let's go!

823
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,780
[Let's go to the campuses of youths!]

824
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:49,640
We'll leave now.

825
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,100
Can you move your seat a little?

826
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:53,980
We'll go to Ewha Womans University first.

827
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,770
- Ewha Womans University?
- What will it be?

828
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:58,810
They say we'll recruit a lot.
I think it'll be a power game.

829
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:02,680
- Maybe it's tug-of-war.
- I think so, too.

830
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,380
Maybe it's a group name tag elimination.

831
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:06,610
That's possible too.

832
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:07,980
Really?

833
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:11,920
Dong Wook, you got to know
about Suk Jin today.

834
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:14,150
I'm from the same town.

835
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:15,780
Oh, you are?

836
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:18,630
Yes, I told you that three years ago.

837
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:20,230
Wasn't my answer the same too?

838
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,610
Isn't that why you got goosebumps?

839
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:27,710
Honestly, Yura has the best figure
out of all the idols.

840
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:30,610
Of course, she insured her legs.

841
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:35,710
Really?
The insurance is not for anyone.

842
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:38,720
Before, Lee Hye Young
insured her legs.

843
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,020
You can insure only a part of your body?

844
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:42,620
Only when it's like a dream.

845
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:46,290
When they're second to none.

846
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:49,490
- Like Yura's legs...
- So her legs are matchless.

847
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:50,560
They are the best.

848
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:55,100
- Do they run in your family?
- My mom has the same legs.

849
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:57,300
Wow, that's amazing!

850
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:00,370
Seo Jun said 'that's amazing!'

851
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:03,110
That's a family treasure!

852
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:07,270
When Seo Jun say stuff like that,
you need to say no more.

853
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:10,250
I don't know if you noticed, but
Seo Jun keeps talking about you.

854
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:13,320
I don't know why I'm trying to appeal.

855
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,590
I must have fallen for
you before I knew.

856
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:18,550
- Is she number one for you?
- Yes.

857
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:21,990
- How old are you, Seo Jun?
- 28.

858
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:25,630
- Yura is...
- 24.

859
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,460
- She's 24.
- That's perfect.

860
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:29,470
Four year difference?
That's fantastic.

861
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:33,640
Seo Jun, this is good!

862
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,770
They say that a four years difference
are a match made in heaven.

863
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:40,140
- Don't we need to exchange numbers?
- We need to open a chat room.

864
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:42,240
- I like that.
- Under 'family' category.

865
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:45,410
We've already exchanged
numbers with Seo Jun.

866
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:48,150
Then, the second brother is
going to be the operator.

867
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:51,290
Be the operator, Second Brother.

868
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:54,760
Am I being too obtuse?

869
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,370
I came here a lot for blind dates.

870
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:08,800
I'll announce the rule.

871
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,400
Find a student who's attending
Ewha Womans University.

872
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:13,940
Just one student.

873
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:16,440
Make sure you check the student's ID

874
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:19,120
and bring them to the appointed spot.

875
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:23,080
Who has money?

876
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:27,410
No one has cash?
They're delicious.

877
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:29,910
Chicken skewer!

878
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,960
Wow, that looks good!

879
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,460
A lot of people are following us.

880
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:38,330
Hello!

881
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:40,800
Aren't you students of
Ewha Womans University?

882
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,530
Hello!
[He greets them in a loud voice.]

883
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:47,150
- You look so excited.
- I think he's enjoying it.

884
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:49,940
Hello!
[You know me, right?]

885
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:55,570
Suk Jin has a lot of memory
at Ewha Womans University.

886
00:50:55,580 --> 00:51:00,250
I had a part-time job around
this area when I was twenty.

887
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:02,920
I had a date here.
At that chicken restaurant!

888
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:06,290
- Oh, here?
- Oh, it's this cafe.

889
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:11,020
It's here, if you go down the stairs

890
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:14,250
there's a cafe.
I used to work here.

891
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:16,750
It's been more than twenty years ago.

892
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:19,170
I was paid 800 won per hour.

893
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:20,710
I think they're the students of Ewha.

894
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:22,500
800 won per hour.

895
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:25,540
I don't know where
the final mission site is

896
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:28,850
but the person has to be at the place.
So let's be careful.

897
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:32,380
It's almost like a press conference.

898
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:35,720
She looks nice.

899
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,820
- Which school do you attend?
- Ewha Womans University.

900
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:41,610
- Are you free tonight?
- Yes, I am.

901
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:43,130
What were you planning to do?

902
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:45,630
We were going to practice
for a talent show.

903
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:49,680
- What talent show?
- We're going to be at a music camp.

904
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:53,570
- We're from the music department.
- Going on a music camp?

905
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:58,310
What are you practicing?
Can you show us a bit?

906
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:03,580
It's a dance to the song 'Why You.'

907
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:06,450
One, two, three, four!

908
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:08,850
How come you don't know yet?

909
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:10,850
You didn't practice it yet, right?

910
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:12,820
This is such an old song!

911
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:14,360
That's true.

912
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:18,550
We don't know where it is,
but this evening

913
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:22,060
only one person can come.

914
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:24,900
I recommend her.

915
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,370
You recommend her?

916
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:29,210
Let's take her.

917
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:32,770
- Let's just go together.
- Do you have free time?

918
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:34,710
Yes.

919
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:39,880
[If they complete the group mission,
they can invite her to the final site.]

920
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:44,920
[The Science Department arrived
at Sungshin Women's University.]

921
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:50,940
This is where the students of
Sungshin visit the most.

922
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:54,400
The air surely feels different here.

923
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,200
My heart is fluttering.

924
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,500
It feels different than
when we were at the cafe.

925
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:04,570
- Which school do you go to?
- I go to Kookmin University.

926
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:07,210
- Which school do you go to?
- It's Chung-Ang University.

927
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:10,680
Which school do you go to?

928
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,280
Not here?

929
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:15,550
- Which school do you go to?
- Sungshin University.

930
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:18,220
Can I see your student ID?

931
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:22,160
- I don't have it with me.
- No?

932
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,560
Do you have your student ID?

933
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:28,200
[They've found a student with an ID.]

934
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,900
Let me check your ID.

935
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:33,770
Majoring in Korean Literature.

936
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:36,540
No Yoon Jae.

937
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:39,610
What are you planning
to do this evening?

938
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:41,840
If you can't come this evening,
we can't take you.

939
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:44,810
Nothing much.

940
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:48,950
[They challenge the mission right away.]

941
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:49,950
Give us the mission!

942
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:52,080
Please, pick one, Yoon Jae.

943
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:54,450
She picked the blue one.

944
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:57,210
Please open it, one, two, three!

945
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:59,060
'Egg embracing the sticker'?

946
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:00,790
What's that?

947
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:03,330
Put an egg on a disk with stickers.

948
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:06,690
Move the disk until
the egg gets all the stickers.

949
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:11,610
Wait until the previous runner
finishes it, then take turns.

950
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:15,110
- Put the stickers upside down.
- It's hard!

951
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:17,710
- This is hard!
- How can we finish it in sixty seconds?

952
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:20,250
- We need to roll the egg.
- How is it possible?

953
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:23,550
- This is difficult!

[There's no boundaries to play a game.]

1268
01:11:55,830 --> 01:11:59,700
So you have fifteen members.

1269
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:02,099
The final mission is to

1270
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:04,470
push the metal bar.

1271
01:12:04,470 --> 01:12:06,840
The metal bars are attached
to the cylinder behind you.

1272
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:09,210
The team will get one point
when you turn

1273
01:12:09,210 --> 01:12:13,750
the metal bar around and get
back to your original spot.

1274
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:17,190
From now on, you can start locating.

1275
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:21,360
[Both teams are having
a meeting to plan strategies.]

1276
01:12:22,460 --> 01:12:25,990
I think ten of us should push one bar.

1277
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,500
We need to push harder close
to the circumference than center.

1278
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:34,370
We'll tightly stand on the outer side.

1279
01:12:34,370 --> 01:12:36,140
[Understood!]

1280
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:38,440
Brothers and sister,
please come over here.

1281
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:40,710
Don't give up.

1282
01:12:40,710 --> 01:12:43,410
Let's do it together.

1283
01:12:43,410 --> 01:12:46,580
We're a family.

1284
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:49,620
Even though we'll be
scattered after this game

1285
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:53,890
at this moment, we're a family.

1286
01:12:53,890 --> 01:12:56,460
- Let's do our best!
- Going down.

1287
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:58,960
No, we'll go up!

1288
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:01,530
One, two, three!
Fight!

1289
01:13:01,530 --> 01:13:04,130
All for one, and one for all!

1290
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:06,470
[High in spirit]

1291
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:12,040
[Who will be the final winner?]

1292
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:13,910
[It's time for the final battle!]

1293
01:13:13,910 --> 01:13:16,740
- I don't know who will win.
- I'm nervous.

1294
01:13:17,450 --> 01:13:19,550
Honestly, I don't want to lose!

1295
01:13:19,550 --> 01:13:23,880
This will be the single round match!

1296
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:30,020
- Ready!
- I'm so nervous!

1297
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:32,930
[Who will bring joy to the youths?]

1298
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:37,080
[Push the metal bar, starts!]

1299
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:43,760
[The metal bar is bent?]

1300
01:13:43,770 --> 01:13:47,750
- We've pushed it too hard.
- We're too strong.

1301
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:50,280
Why are we so strong?

1302
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:53,110
Did you do too well?

1303
01:13:53,110 --> 01:13:56,380
[They can't control their energy!]

1304
01:13:56,380 --> 01:14:01,950
[They say things happen
where the youths are.]

1305
01:14:01,950 --> 01:14:06,220
[The iron bar is bent!]

1306
01:14:06,230 --> 01:14:09,060
[Therefore...]

1307
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:12,530
[we've changed the final mission
with tug-of-war.]

1308
01:14:12,530 --> 01:14:15,930
Brothers and sisters, good luck!

1309
01:14:15,930 --> 01:14:19,100
The earlier mission
can't be carried out

1310
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:23,470
so we'll replace it with tug-of-war.

1311
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:26,170
Our two members have arrived.

1312
01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:27,970
- Are they here?
- Yes.

1313
01:14:27,980 --> 01:14:31,410
They can join you.

1314
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:34,390
[What a nice timing!]

1315
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:37,450
This will be two of three!

1316
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:43,390
You will win when the red dot
on the rope goes over the yellow line.

1317
01:14:43,390 --> 01:14:48,070
Sit down and grab the rope.

1318
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:51,970
Fight, Red Team!

1319
01:14:51,970 --> 01:14:56,970
[The first round will
divide the teams' destiny.]

1320
01:14:56,970 --> 01:14:59,910
Ready!

1321
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:04,010
[Will it be the department of
liberal arts tied with friendship?]

1322
01:15:04,010 --> 01:15:07,220
[Or the Science Department
armed with physical strength?]

1323
01:15:08,050 --> 01:15:11,050
[The first round of tug-of-war starts!]

1324
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:15,390
[Let's go, young men!]

1325
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:24,270
[It's a direct confrontation!]

1326
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:30,880
[But the department of
liberal arts get behind.]

1327
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:34,080
[It's a critical moment!]

1328
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:37,610
[Now is the chance!]

1329
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:46,020
[The Science Department won
the first round of tug-of-war.]

1330
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:50,550
[Soldiers! We won!]

1331
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:53,130
[No one can stop them.]

1332
01:15:53,130 --> 01:15:56,200
We have a disadvantage.
We can't help it.

1333
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,330
We can win one more round!

1334
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:02,200
We shouldn't lose our pace.

1335
01:16:03,070 --> 01:16:06,210
Can we call this one off?
We have a lot more girls.

1336
01:16:06,210 --> 01:16:09,710
[We can't give up like this.]
We can do it!

1337
01:16:09,710 --> 01:16:12,480
[The second round of tug-of-war]

1338
01:16:13,780 --> 01:16:15,720
[Both teams are ready for a combat.]

1339
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:17,620
Fight!

1340
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:21,520
[Will the battle end here?]

1341
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:24,290
[Or will it be turned around?]

1342
01:16:25,530 --> 01:16:28,130
[The second round of tug-of-war, starts!]

1343
01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:32,960
[The Science Department start
pulling hard from the beginning.]

1344

his waist and crawls!]

1345
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:38,440
[This is the last change for
the Liberal Arts Department.]

1346
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:42,140
[The balance of power between
the two teams was upset.]

1347
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:47,680
[The Liberal Arts Department
are out-muscled.]

1348

[They're slowly dragged
down into defeat.]

1349
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:54,310
[To be pulled or not to be pulled.]

1350

[That is the question.]

1351

1352

[The battle field becomes a festival.]

1355
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:22,010
It was impossible for us to win.

1356

[It's fine.
You're still young.]

1357

[Thank you so much!]
You did a good job!

1358
01:17:27,090 --> 01:17:29,850
We couldn't help it.

Kim Jong Kook will award
the winning team.

1360

Please, give them
the money to support youth.

1361

[It's an honor.]

1362
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:42,050
[It's a small gift for the youths.]
I'm sorry.

1363
01:17:42,050 --> 01:17:45,770
- One by one.
- Don't worry, I'll personally award you.

1364
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:48,060
I'll double the amount.
