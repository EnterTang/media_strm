Yeong Gwang.

92
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,730
Why are you so sleepy?

93
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:24,030
Why? Had a nightmare?

94
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,930
Have we arrived yet?

95
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,230
We've arrived.

96
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,540
This is the president's villa.

97
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,040
Come on.

98
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,750
-=Summer, 17 years ago.=-

99
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,950
Follow me.

100
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,950
Come on!

101
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,860
You're Yeong Gwang, right?

102
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,660
Hello.

103
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,670
I'm Shin Dong primary school,
year 3 class 1's Gim Yeong Gwang.

104
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,970
Greeting with such energy, just like a man.

105
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:06,370
It's because I'm like my father.

106
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,980
That's true, your father must
be happy to have a son like you.

107
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:17,880
I'm not sure if bringing my son
is appropriate, Madam.

108
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,280
It's nice to have the children
be friends and play together.

109
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,190
It was good that you brought him.

110
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,490
Would you like to go in?

111
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,990
Jae In and the children are all in there.

112
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,490
Yeong Gwang, don't be a rascal.

113
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,600
Be good, understand?

114
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,100
Go inside.

115
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,210
I'm going to go pick up the President.

116
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,210
Okay, drive carefully.

117
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,510
Yes, Madam.

118
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,710
Yes, honey. Sorry, sorry.

119
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,210
I just finished right now.

120
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,710
Did all the guests arrive?

121
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,010
All right, I'm coming back now.

122
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:32,020
Something I'm forgetting? Ah...

123
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,120
Right, present.

124
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,930
I'll come at the speed of light.

125
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:44,130
I love you, honey.

126
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:50,140
Really! Today's supposed to be a BBQ party...
the heavens sure aren't helping.

127
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,840
Ah, sorry.

128
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,950
Really, sorry.

129
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,550
Hey, who are you?

130
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,850
Me? I'm Gim Yeong Gwang.

131
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,950
What? Gim Yeong Gwang?

132
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,160
What is your father's job?

133
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,060
Job?

134
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,260
Jae In's father is the President.

135
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,960
In U's father is the vice president.

136
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,260
My father is the managing director.

137
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,060
What is your father?

138
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,660
Oh... that.

139
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,770
He's a driver.

140
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,270
The driver who drives the President.

141
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,870
Car driver?

142
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,470
Maybe, you're Driver Gim's son?

143
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,870
Mmm, that's right.

144
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,780
Looks like you know my father.

145
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,380
What? What's the Driver's son doing here?

146
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,980
Why, the driver's son can't be here?

147
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,080
Of course you can't.

148
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,880
Why can't I be here?

149
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,880
Because you're the driver's son!

150
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,490
My father said,

151
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:47,490
that there will always be people
who don't know their place.

152
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,390
Just like you.

153
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:48,990
What?

154
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:52,900
At times like those, he said that you have
to quickly show him his place.

155
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,600
That's what my father said.

156
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,800
What did you say?

157
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,100
If you get beaten,
you won't feel pain right?

158
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,000
Then if you did that,

159
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
would it be okay, even if your father
got fired from the company?

160
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,410
What? This guy...

161
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,910
Don't fight. I've learned that fighting is bad.

162
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:09,410
My father said.

163
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,820
Who are you?

164
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,020
Hi, you're Gim Yeong Gwang, right?

165
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,120
I've heard a lot about you from Driver Gim.

166
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,620
Thank you for coming.

167
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,530
I was the one who invited him,
so please try to get along.

168
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,130
Really?

169
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:30,240
All right, we were going to play baseball
right now, so I'll let you join us.

170
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,340
Base... baseball?

171
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:34,140
Why? You can't play baseball?

172
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,940
What do you mean
I don't know how to play?

173
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:41,350
Where I'm from, I'm the home run king.

174
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,950
You don't even know
what you're talking about.

175
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:43,750
Really?

176
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,950
That's a relief. Then come on out.

177
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,390
I said it before, right?

178
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,600
For someone who doesn't know their place,

179
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,200
you have to show them their place quickly.

180
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,120
Ah, what to do?

181
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,420
Gim Yeong Gwang, are you okay?

182
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,030
Blood!

183
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,630
What are we going to do?
He got a nosebleed.

184
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,530
It's a bean ball. There's no other way.

185
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,930
Go walk out to first base.

186
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,740
No, I'm going to bat.

187
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,340
What?

188
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,640
I'm not going to take the walk.
I'm going to keep batting.

189
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,350
That's not how it goes in baseball.
If you get hit by the ball, you take a walk.

190
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,750
I'm not going to take the walk.
I'm going to keep batting!

191
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,450
Suit yourself!

192
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,710
Run!

193
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,810
What are you doing? Run!

194
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:27,110
Hurry! Run!

195
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:37,320
Hey, what are you doing,
catch the ball! Run! Run!

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


198
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,930
Run! Run!

199
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,030
Quick, pass, pass!

200
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,830
Run!

201
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:43,930
Quick!

202
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:46,730
Run! Run!

203
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:51,240
Run! Run!

204
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,360
You won!

205
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,760
What are you saying?

206
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,770
Why is our company in the name list
of investigation for secret fund transfers?

207
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,470
In the last few months, we have
gathered many convincing evidence.

208
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,770
And in it, there's evidence
against your company.

209
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,980
The formal summoning letter
will be sent tomorrow morning.

210
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,780
Before that, if today is good, if you voluntarily
agree to support the investigation in court,

211
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,580
we will consider reducing your sentence.

212
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,680
I came personally to
help consult about that.

213
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,990
Prosecutor U, I need to know
what's happening to be able to assist.

214
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:44,090
I've never done any illegal transactions.

215
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,290
I don't even know how the
black money came about.

216
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:49,090
If that's the case, Mr. Il Gu, then your
friend should know about it.

217
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:52,500
Your partner, Seo Jae Myeong.

218
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,210
-=Vice President, Seo Jae Myeong=-

219
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:06,110
Ah, Il Gu.

220
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,920
Why are you in my office?

221
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,520
Aigoo, has it gotten this late, already?
(Aigoo - oh dear, oh my god)

222
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,820
At this rate, you will be late
for your daughter's birthday.

223
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:22,730
Ah, I bought her a stuff toy.

224
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,730
I wonder if she will like it.

225
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,330
I will give it to her later.

226
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:30,140
You're not going home right now?

227
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,840
Before that, there's a place I have to go to.

228
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,940
Let's go together.

229
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,290
Where are we going?

230
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,890
Prosecutor U came.

231
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,690
Said that she's investigating
about the black money.

232
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:29,500
When we started the company,
didn't we agree,

233
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:34,600
that there won't be any secrets regarding
the operations of the company?

234
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,600
You see, Il Gu.

235
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,010
I'll explain everything, but for now, let's go
somewhere so I can slowly go over every...

236
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:45,210
Making money is important, and the
company doing well is also important,

237
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,210
but we had to avoid those methods.

238
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,820
For the company's sake,
there was no other way.

239
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,220
Not for the company's sake, but it was
probably for your own selfish desires.

240
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,920
The manner in which you
shifted the company's money,

241
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,320
you can explain it at
the prosecutor's office.

242
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:04,930
You, what kind of deal did you
make with the prosecutor?

243
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:09,030
Using me as the scapegoat,
what kind of deal did you make?

244
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:12,740
For your own survival,
did you really sell me out?

245
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,040
I've already called Attorney Pak.

246
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,440
During the investigation,
he will be by your side.

247
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,750
This guy, how can you do this to me?

248
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,750
Saying I'm your only friend,

249
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,850
how could you do this to me?

250
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,050
Because you're my only friend,

251
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,650
that's why I made the best choice for you.

252
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:29,150
Don't you know?

253
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:35,060
Stop the car. Can you not hear me
telling you to stop the car?

254
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,960
This is your last chance.

255
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,670
I can only protect you if you go and
explain the situation voluntarily.

256
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,570
Understand?

257
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:47,270
Explaining that kind of thing,
why should I do it?

258
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,070
I won't go!

259
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:51,280
Do you want to see me
get caught that much?

260
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,180
Then let him come catch me directly.

261
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,380
I will not step into the prosecutor's office.

262
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,390
- Jae Myeong.
- Stop the car immediately.

263
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:04,390
- President...
- Stop the car! Stop the car! Stop the car!

264
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:25,310
- Damn brat.
- Vice President! Vice President!

265
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,830
Il Gu...

266
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:28,430
Il Gu, are you all right?

267
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,760
Vice President.

268
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,460
It's you?

269
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:57,360
The President is still inside?

270
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:16,580
Il Gu... Il Gu... this can't be... no!

271
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:22,890
Il Gu, no!

272
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:57,320
Madam, it looks like it's going to rain,
what should we do?

273
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,420
For now, let's bring everything inside.

274
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,940
Hello.

275
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:13,440
Yes, I'm Yun Il Gu's wife.

276
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:24,550
Does it hurt?

277
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,650
It's bearable.

278
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,880
That... actually...

279
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,780
Actually, I'm not a home-run king.

280
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:58,980
And I've never played baseball before, either.

281
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,190
Today is my first time hitting a home-run.

282
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:03,390
Wow, then you must be a genius!

283
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:05,290
Genius? Me?

284
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:08,390
Even though it was your first time,
you played so well...

285
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,600
so you must be a genius!

286
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,910
You, will you marry me?

287
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:25,910
In the future, when I actually become
the home-run king,

288
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:29,820
when that time comes,
will you marry me?

289
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:42,530
Jae In! Jae In...

290
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:47,830
Jae In, we have to hurry and
go see your father, come on.

291
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:08,550
Hey!  Hey!  Hey!

292
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,360
This...

293
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:16,960
My first home-run ball, I'll give it to you.

294
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,170
Hurry up and get in the car.

295
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,070
Mmm...

296
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:29,980
The question you asked me just now,
the answer is yes.

297
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:34,280
So in the future, you must become the
home-run king, understand?

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


299
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,430
Where's Yun Il Gu's family?

300
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:30,540
Right now, they should be on their way.

301
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,640
At the time of the accident,
you were all in the same car right?

302
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,840
How can such a thing happen?

303
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,940
Please explain how it happened.

304
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:05,270
Mom, look at this.

305
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:10,680
Please, honey.

306
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,580
Father said that you
should not bite your fingers.

307
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:45,010
Prosecutor, do you have to investigate
traffic accident cases as well?

308
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:50,220
Currently, Mr. Yun Il Gu is a important
witness in our investigation.

309
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:54,120
So of course we would have
to investigate this accident.

310
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:05,230
Would you please explain,
Mr. Seo Jae Myeong.

311
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,040
That? that...

312
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:18,040
It's my fault, Prosecutor.

313
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:28,650
The rain... the rain suddenly
came down so heavily.

314
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:36,660
<i>I didn't think that the road
would be so slippery.</i>

315
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:47,170
Mom.

316
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,880
Mom, I'm afraid.

317
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,180
We have to hurry to your father, Jae In.

318
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,580
Father is probably waiting for us.

319
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:00,390
Mom.

320
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:07,690
It is all right. We'll be able to
see father soon... understand?

321
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,410
Mom!

322
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:22,310
Jae In!

323
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:30,420
All of it...

324
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:35,020
Prosecutor, all this happened because of me.

325
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:42,030
Therefore,

326
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,330
please take me in.

327
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,050
Prosecutor, something big happened.

328
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,970
Careful... careful...

329
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:28,270
1, 2, 3.

330
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,280
Be careful.

331
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,780
Look around carefully!

332
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:38,380
It is hard to search because of the heavy rain.

333
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:48,190
Here! Here!

334
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:49,900
What is it?

335
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,700
There's a girl's shoe.

336
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,400
This was found in the car.

337
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,100
It's a pair.

338
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:00,510
Then, what exactly happened to her?

339
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:02,210
Could it be...

340
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,920
I've decided, Mom.

341
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,820
Decided on what?

342
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,920
I want to become a baseball player.

343
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,730
So please buy me some baseball equipment.

344
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:26,330
Son, do you know how much
baseball equipment's cost?

345
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:28,530
You think that sport is for everybody?

346
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:33,340
That's something only rich families can afford.

347
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:37,340
For a family like us,
we shouldn't even think about it.

348
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,140
Understand?

349
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:42,550
Mom, do you know how much
pay baseball players gets in a year?

350
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:47,150
And if I become the baseball king,
Mom will become very wealthy.

351
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:48,650
Little brat...

352
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:50,860
Do you even know what being
the home-run king means?

353
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,960
Of course, I know.

354
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,060
So, you can just take it as an
investment for the future.

355
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,360
Just let me do it, Mom.

356
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,470
Please, please?

357
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:04,070
<i>Hey daugther-in-law! Come out!</i>

358
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:06,170
What's happening?

359
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:09,370
<i>Hurry and come out for a moment, hurry!</i>

360
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,280
What is it?

361
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,380
What's the matter mother-in-law?

362
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:17,180
That, that, isn't that the daughter of the president?
=Earlier in the expressway,=

363
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,890
=came some very depressing news.=

364
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:21,490
=Reporter Ra Yeong Seok reports.=

365
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:23,190
=Today at around 7p.m.=

366
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:27,190
=After the wife of the president found out
about the accident involving the president,=

367
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:30,600
=on her way to Seoul, because of
the slippery conditions of the road=

368
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,900
=Resulted in a car accident=

369
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:38,900
=At that time, their 8-year-old
daughter was also in the car.=

370
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,920
- Blood pressure?
- 150.

371
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,020
Clear!

372
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,530
200!

373
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:06,130
Clear!

374
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:10,840
200 again!

375
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,560
The situation... how is it?

376
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,560
We've done the emergency procedures.

377
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:41,670
But because the heart is not stable,
it's very dangerous.

378
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:45,870
It's still too early to tell.

379
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:51,780
<i>What should we do now?</i>

380
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,590
What are we going to do
about the company now?

381
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:05,390
Although we know that the vice president has
lost his best friend, and is not in the best of moods,

382
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:10,500
we still have to discuss about
the position of the president.

383
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,100
What's there to discuss about?

384
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:18,600
Of course, the vice president
should take over President Yun's position.

385
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:22,510
<i>I'm going to the prosecutor's
office and tell them,</i>

386
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:25,810
<i>how you misused the company funds.</i>

387
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:30,520
How did this happen?

388
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,720
President Yun died just like that,
and his wife is now in a coma.

389
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,920
Their only daughter is now missing
after having been washed away by the river.

390
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,030
How did a family get so
much misfortune in a day?

391
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,730
<i>This is your last chance.</i>

392
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:48,530
<i>I can only protect you if you go and
explain the situation voluntarily.</i>

393
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:51,840
<i>I will not step into the prosecutor's office.</i>

394
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,640
<i>Stop the car!</i>

395
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:53,300
Mom? Mom!

396
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:07,510
Mom!

397
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,520
Mom!

398
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:26,930
Yes, I'm Seo Jae Myeong.

399
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:30,240
Yes, that's right.

400
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:32,940
What?

401
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:36,040
We're calling regarding the missing
people's report that was filed yesterday.

402
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:41,050
We discovered a child with similar
features on the road, crying.

403
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,550
Eat it.

404
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:46,350
- You have to eat it to see your parents again.
- But the kid is not talking.

405
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:49,450
She's not telling us her
name or her address.

406
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:52,460
I understand. I will send somebody
to confirm, immediately.

407
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:58,260
Please don't let anybody know
before it has been confirmed.

408
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,570
Yes.

409
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,380
You look tired.

410
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,580
What's the matter now?

411
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:24,390
You must make a trip to the
prosecutor's office tomorrow.

412
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:30,100
We plan to investigate both the black money issue
and the accident at the same time.

413
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:36,400
I really suspect whether
it's only the driver's fault.

414
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,600
I'll see you tomorrow.

415
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,110
I didn't do anything wrong.

416
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,510
Yun Il Gu is the company's President.

417
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:47,610
I only follow his instructions.

418
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:51,420
The dead can't talk, is it because of that?

419
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:55,120
So you will let your friend
take the blame for you?

420
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,320
Yes, that's right.

421
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,130
Yun Il Gu is my only friend.

422
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:02,830
And this company is just
like his other identity.

423
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:06,730
So, the least I can do is stay
and guard this company.

424
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:10,440
Now you even want to have your
friend's company for yourself?

425
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,440
Although it's a pity,

426
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,240
Il Gu's wife is still in a coma,

427
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:20,550
and his daughter, not only is she young
but is currently missing.

428
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:28,150
Right now, it's up to me
to be the protector.

429
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,960
Yun Il Gu is,

430
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:34,460
the husband of my favorite junior
and we have a very good relationship.

431
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:39,360
Do you think that I will stand aside
and see you take over the company?

432
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,570
When does the prosecutor of
the Republic of South Korea,

433
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:44,470
concern herself with the
operation of a company?

434
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:45,470
Listen, Mr. Seo Jae Myeong!

435
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:48,070
If there is anything else,

436
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,080
then please talk to my lawyer.

437
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:56,280
Goodbye.

438
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,790
Is there news about Yun Il Gu's daughter?

439
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:09,600
We're still looking.

440
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:16,900
We must find her no matter what.
Even if we have to drain the river.

441
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:25,010
It's me.

442
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:31,620
There is something you have
to help me confirm.

443
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,140
May I help you?

444
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,940
That, that is...

445
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,850
We heard you found the child, so...

446
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:02,150
She's over there.

447
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:10,260
Aigoo, Jae In!

448
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:17,260
Jae In? Jae In? It's ajussi!
(Ajussi - older man, uncle)

449
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:22,470
Are you hurt?

450
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:26,370
Jae In.

451
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,580
Aigoo, looks like she can recognize you.

452
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:37,480
She says she doesn't know
when we ask her name.

453
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,390
Whatever we ask her, she couldn't answer,
I was so worried.

454
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:43,490
Really fortunate,
that she found her father.

455
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,000
<i>Don't bring her back.</i>

456
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,800
<i>What do you mean, Vice President?</i>

457
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,210
<i>Even if it's Il Gu's daughter,</i>

458
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:04,910
<i>don't bring her back.</i>

459
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:09,410
<i>Didn't you say that you would
like to open a restaurant?</i>

460
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:12,520
<i>I'll give you money to open one.</i>

461
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,220
<i>Vice President.</i>

462
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,220
<i>I heard that you have 3 children?</i>

463
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:20,230
<i>I will be responsible for the
future of those children.</i>

464
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:22,430
<i>How about it?</i>

465
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:26,130
<i>But that's not the way.</i>

466
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:28,630
<i>The heaven is watching.</i>

467
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:32,340
<i>Even the president who have passed
away will not forgive you, Vice President.</i>

468
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,440
<i>Then why did you do it that time?</i>

469
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,540
<i>Why did you help me in
front of the prosecutor?</i>

470
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:42,050
<i>First of all, I felt that I didn't
take good care of the president.</i>

471
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:46,450
<i>And you also saved
me from drowning.</i>

472
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:50,060
<i>Yes, it was me who pulled
you out of the water.</i>

473
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,860
<i>I saved your life.</i>

474
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:56,660
<i>And you helped me in front of the
prosecutor by giving false statement.</i>

475
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,070
<i>Don't you understand?</i>

476
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:06,070
<i>You're an accomplice.</i>

477
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:09,370
<i>Accomplice?</i>

478
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:15,880
<i>Yes, an accomplice.
We're in the same boat now.</i>

479
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:18,180
<i>Do you understand?</i>

480
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,990
<i>Vice President.</i>

481
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:29,290
<i>As long as you erase her name,</i>

482
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:32,900
<i>Yun Jae In, that name,</i>

483
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,600
<i>give her a new one.</i>

484
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:40,310
<i>Let her start over
where nobody knows her.</i>

485
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:46,210
<i>As long as you do those,</i>

486
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:52,020
<i>I'll make all that I
promised to you happen.</i>

487
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:13,640
Mother-in-law, it's time to eat.

488
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,640
<i>Okay.</i>

489
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:20,750
Gyeong Ju, Jin Ju, Yeong Gwang, time to eat!

490
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:22,950
Come out quickly!

491
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:29,860
Oh, it looks delicious!

492
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,260
Close your book and eat.

493
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,560
Yeong Gwang, aren't you coming out?

494
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:41,370
That spoiled brat only knows
how to sleep everyday.

495
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:45,770
Yeong Gwang! Gim Yeong Gwang,
aren't you going to get up?

496
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:51,380
Where did that child go?

497
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:02,790
Excuse me. By any chance, have you seen my father?

498
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:04,890
Your father? Who is he?

499
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:07,990
He's Gim Il Bae.

500
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:09,500
I'm not really sure.

501
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:12,200
Sorry to disturb you.

502
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,320
Oh, it's you guys.

503
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:36,620
I was the one who played baseball
with you all in the villa last time.

504
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:38,920
It's me, Gim Yeong Gwang,
do you remember me?

505
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,930
What are you doing here?

506
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:45,930
I saw it on the news last night,
something bad happened to that child.

507
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:49,540
And I don't know what happened to her.
Have they found her?

508
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:50,940
Is that child okay?

509
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:53,140
No, she's dead.

510
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:53,940
What?

511
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:58,740
Heard them talking earlier,
seems like she drowned in the river.

512
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:01,550
Why? Are you sad?

513
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:05,750
The person that's always
on your side is gone. Pity, huh?

514
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:12,560
What a joke, a driver's son coming here.

515
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,160
What's wrong with being a driver's son?
What's wrong?

516
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,360
You still don't understand what's wrong?

517
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:24,570
No matter how hard you try,
you'll forever be beneath me.

518
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:28,870
Because your father
is beneath my father.

519
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:29,780
Stop it.

520
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:32,080
Just like a dog trying
to suck up to it's master.

521
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:32,980
Won't you stop it!

522
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:36,880
Humbling himself, bowing to us everyday.
That's your father.

523
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


524
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,080
I told you to stop it, you brat!

525
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:49,700
Who started it?

526
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,900
He hit me first, Father.

527
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:59,510
Yeong Gwang, you did it?
You hit the young master?

528
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:03,810
Vice President, I'm really sorry.

529
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:08,610
It's my fault I didn't educate
my son properly. I'm very sorry.

530
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:10,920
I didn't do anything wrong, Father.

531
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,820
So you don't have to
lower your head and apologize.

532
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:15,420
You brat, what's wrong with you today?

533
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,820
Father isn't a lap dog, right?

534
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:21,130
Not the type of person
who humbles himself, right?

535
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:24,730
You're our father, my father.

536
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:29,640
So, when you have not
done anything wrong,

537
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,640
then don't be like that!

538
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,840
I'm very sorry, Vice President.

539
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,450
Stretch out your hand.

540
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:54,860
As a man.

541
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:59,360
How can you be so impulsive, so frivolous?

542
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:03,370
Why did you make fun of that person
who can never become your opponent?
Making a fool of yourself.

543
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:06,270
I was wrong, Father.

544
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:09,780
Get out.

545
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:41,810
Drink the milk. You haven't eaten, have you?

546
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:57,420
Why did you come to the funeral?

547
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:02,030
I was worried about that child.

548
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:06,130
The child I saw that day in the villa.

549
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:11,440
That child is not really dead, right?

550
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,040
Right, Father?

551
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:21,550
If only she can return safely.

552
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:47,470
<i>Ajussi!</i>

553
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:02,390
<i>As long as you erase her name,
Yun Jae In, that name,</i>

554
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:04,290
<i>give her a new one.</i>

555
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:06,790
<i>Let her start over
where nobody knows her.</i>

556
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:11,600
<i>Ajussi.</i>

557
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:17,500
<i>Your name is Yun Jae In.</i>

558
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:20,710
<i>Understand?</i>

559
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:22,910
<i>What's your name?</i>

560
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:25,110
<i>Yun Jae In.</i>

561
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:27,210
<i>What's your name?</i>

562
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:30,020
<i>It's Yun Jae In.</i>

563
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:36,220
<i>Yes, that's your name.</i>

564
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:42,430
<i>Don't ever... ever forget your name.</i>

565
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:45,330
<i>Do you understand?</i>

566
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:54,240
<i>I'm... I'm really sorry, Jae In.</i>

567
00:50:55,340 --> 00:51:00,550
<i>I'm a criminal.</i>

568
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:04,750
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

569
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:30,580
Yeong Gwang.

570
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:32,880
Yes?

571
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:40,190
You absolutely mustn't live like your father.

572
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:41,990
Understand?

573
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:43,590
Father.

574
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:49,290
When you grow up, you must become
an outstanding person.

575
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:54,100
Don't become a useless person like me.

576
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:59,400
You must become an outstanding person.

577
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,310
Do you understand?

578
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,160
I declare,

579
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:56,660
I will replace my one
and only friend, Yun Il Gu,

580
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,260
and his family,

581
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:02,170
as Geodae's President.

582
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:03,770
I will,

583
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:08,170
serve.

584
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,790
Her daughter?

585
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:23,490
Still no news?

586
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:37,500
My name is Yun Jae In.

587
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:43,110
My name is Yun Jae In.

588
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:47,610
My name is Yun Jae In.

589
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:16,740
Quickly get off the car.

590
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:21,450
Please hold the umbrella properly, ajussi.

591
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:23,650
Sorry, go on in.

592
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:56,080
I want to,

593
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:58,080
defeat you.

594
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,290
Seo In U you,

595
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:02,790
I will defeat you.

596
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:05,790
Remember this.

597
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:07,690
<i>I said that at that time.</i>

598
00:55:07,690 --> 00:55:10,800
<i>It seems like I really believed
that childish talk.</i>

599
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,600
<i>Using the will and
determination of the poor.</i>

600
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:18,200
<i>With all my strength, to defeat that guy.</i>

601
00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:08,050
<i>But the reality is,</i>

602
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:11,060
<i>I've never defeated that fellow once.</i>

603
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:14,760
<i>No, it's impossible to win.</i>

604
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,870
Kick, kick.

605
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:30,380
Run, run!

606
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:32,480
What type of old-school training method is this?

607
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,880
It's already the 21st century.

608
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,680
How will I be able to beat that Seo In U?

609
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,790
Stop talking nonsense and run!

610
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:01,110
You've worked hard.

611
00:57:04,610 --> 00:57:05,810
Hey, Gim Yeong Gwang.

612
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:07,210
You've lost again?

613
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:11,120
Why can't you even last a
week in the first string, kid?

614
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:19,420
What are your views on the competition?

615
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:20,930
Do you have anything to say?

616
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:23,630
Please say something?

617
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:26,430
I will give you two more months.
If you can't do it,

618
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:28,830
I'll remove you from the second string!

619
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:32,240
<i>The poor, only relying on desire,</i>

620
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:36,040
<i>in the end, will never be able to defeat the rich.</i>

621
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:39,650
<i>But to understand this truth,</i>

622
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:43,250
<i>it took me 17 years.</i>

623
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,370
Yeong Gwang. Carefully, carefully!

624
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:15,480
Gently, gently!

625
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,380
Lightly, please be more gentle.

626
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:23,690
Lightly, lightly.

627
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:36,400
Yeong Gwang, wake up, wake up.

628
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,810
Yeong Gwang, wake up, wake up.

629
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


630
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


631
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:46,710
Wake up, wake up.

632
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:50,020
Lightly, lightly.

633
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,020
All right, thanks, thanks.

634
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:54,320
Yeong Gwang.

635
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:58,520
Yeong Gwang, wake up.

636
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:58,520


637
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:00,230
Nurse, nurse!

638
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:02,730
This person's life is in danger,
please take a look.

639
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:05,530
Please wait for a moment, there's an
emergency patient who arrived first.

640
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:07,630
That person is urgent, what about him?

641
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:11,840
The baseball player Seo In U
has been injured.

642
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:12,840
In U?

643
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:13,740
Yes.

644
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:14,640
Is it?

645
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:17,040
I need the person in charge to sign first.

646
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,840
Yes, yes, yes.

647
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:20,850
Yeong Gwang, you wait here for a moment.

648
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:23,050
I'll go and take a look at him first.

649
00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:26,150
In U... how seriously is he hurt?

650
00:59:47,070 --> 00:59:51,180
Who? Is someone there?

651
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,180
<i>Only liking a person like Seo In U.</i>

652
00:59:55,180 --> 00:59:55,880
Let go!

653
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:59,280
<i>This dirty world.</i>

654
01:00:00,090 --> 01:00:03,390
Is anyone out there?

655
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:18,800
<i>Nobody cares about a no name
second stringer like me.</i>

656
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,510
<i>This despicable world.</i>

657
01:00:41,530 --> 01:00:45,430
<i>In this despicable and dirty world,</i>

658
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:50,840
<i>a person suddenly grabbed hold of me.</i>

659
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:55,440
You're him, right? Player Gim Yeong Gwang?

660
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:58,640
Team Dragons, player number 47,

661
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,350
in the Phoenix Cup,

662

hitting the win,

663
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:05,650
that glory hitter, Gim Yeong Gwang, right?

664
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:07,450
You know me?

665
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:10,450
Omo! Looks like I'm right!
(Omo - oh my)

666
01:01:10,450 --> 01:01:13,260
Hello, I'm your fan.

Right.

669
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:17,760
Actually, after that match,

670
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,970
I became your fan.

671
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:24,370
Who are you?

01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:27,870
Me? I'm Yun Jae In.

673

Jae In?

674

Yes, Yun Jae In.

675
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:38,980
<i>At the worse possible moment of my life,</i>

<i>Shouldn't be about him right?</i>

684
01:02:27,730 --> 01:02:31,240
Are you here to plead to me
about Yeong Gwang?

685
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,440
<i>The patient using the VIP room,</i>

686
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,540
his manner is like crap.

687
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:36,840
Crap?

688
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:40,250
<i>Gim Yeong Gwang,
you plan to destroy your life?</i>

What are you doing?

It couldn't be, could it? Yun Jae In.

691
01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:52,060
What are you doing over there?

692
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:53,860
<i>The ribs are broken.</i>

<i>A total of four ribs.</i>

<i>This is all your fault!</i>

695
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:01,770
Why are you constantly
destroying my life?

696
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:03,670
Just what are you?

697

Your fan.
