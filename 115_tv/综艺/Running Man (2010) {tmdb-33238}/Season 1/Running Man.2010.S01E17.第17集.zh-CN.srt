1
00:00:04,634 --> 00:00:06,735
Hey.

2
00:00:06,803 --> 00:00:08,637
We've got company.

3
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:09,704
So we do.

4
00:00:09,772 --> 00:00:11,873
Mm.

5
00:00:11,942 --> 00:00:13,175
Yeah, he sees us, too.

6
00:00:13,243 --> 00:00:14,543
Yeah, sure, he does.

7
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,010
You'd better do something.

8
00:00:16,078 --> 00:00:17,545
Mm-hmm.

9
00:00:17,612 --> 00:00:19,113
All right. 50 yards.

10
00:00:19,181 --> 00:00:20,315
Uh-huh.

11
00:00:20,382 --> 00:00:21,482
40.

12
00:00:22,651 --> 00:00:23,851
35!

13
00:00:23,919 --> 00:00:25,686
- Yep.
- Shoot! Shoot!

14
00:00:25,754 --> 00:00:27,221
Shoot! Shoot, man!

15
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:28,256
Shoot!

16
00:00:31,726 --> 00:00:33,293
Ooh!

17
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:36,997
Mike?

18
00:00:37,065 --> 00:00:39,132
Honey, have you seen my brown shoes?

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,700
Oh! Wait a minute.
Here they are.

20
00:00:40,768 --> 00:00:43,603
Mom! Mandy blew a fuse
with her hair dryer <i>again!</i>

21
00:00:43,671 --> 00:00:45,038
- Ooh.
- I did not! It was Eve!

22
00:00:45,106 --> 00:00:46,673
- I don't even dry my hair!
- Ooh.

23
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,409
What kind of person even admits that?

24
00:00:50,529 --> 00:00:52,453
Last Man Standing - S01E17

Sync and corrections by Gatto
for www.addic7ed.com

27
00:00:57,117 --> 00:00:59,518
Now I was gonna try clear gloss
over flat matte.

28
00:00:59,586 --> 00:01:00,987
- Mm-hmm.
- Never dries right.

29
00:01:01,054 --> 00:01:03,055
Okay, what you wanna do
is use a water-based polish

30
00:01:03,123 --> 00:01:05,023
and that way, you don't need
a cover gloss. Right, dad?

31
00:01:05,091 --> 00:01:07,592
I'm really trying hard
not to listen to this.

32
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:10,161
Maybe I need to, you know,
shake things up.

33
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:11,562
Try something exciting.

34
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,798
Something exciting.
I like the sound of that.

35
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:14,899
I'm way ahead of you.

36
00:01:14,967 --> 00:01:18,069
Ten nails--
ten different colors!

37
00:01:18,137 --> 00:01:21,505
Oh, man, honey, we gotta get outta here.

38
00:01:21,572 --> 00:01:24,041
Let's do something exciting
this weekend. Go winter camping.

39
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:26,110
We'll get the snowmobiles out,
have a riot, huh?

40
00:01:26,177 --> 00:01:27,344
Nope, can't.

41
00:01:27,412 --> 00:01:29,380
I got my pickling class
with Michelle tonight.

42
00:01:29,447 --> 00:01:31,615
- Your pickling class?
- Yep, yep.

43
00:01:31,682 --> 00:01:35,219
That makes your knitting group
sound like an x game.

44
00:01:35,286 --> 00:01:37,786
Stop. I enjoy it.

45
00:01:37,854 --> 00:01:39,822
Plus, you gotta take Boyd to Gymborama,

46
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,857
and you promised you'd take Eve
to get new socks.

47
00:01:41,925 --> 00:01:45,428
- Whoo! How could I forget a day like that?
- Yeah.

48
00:01:45,496 --> 00:01:46,562
Where is Eve?

49
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,664
Oh, uh, she's studying for math club.

50
00:01:48,732 --> 00:01:50,299
- Before breakfast?
- Yeah, well...

51
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:51,800
She's gotta dial it down a bit.

52
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:53,902
How come she can't be
more like professor nail polish

53
00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:54,869
and aunt boring over there?

54
00:01:58,774 --> 00:02:01,476
Hey, so, uh, I'm wondering

55
00:02:01,544 --> 00:02:04,746
if next Saturday, you could
pick up Boyd from day care?

56
00:02:04,813 --> 00:02:05,880
Yeah. Sure. Why?

57
00:02:05,948 --> 00:02:07,649
Can't tell you.

58
00:02:07,716 --> 00:02:08,649
Is it personal?

59
00:02:08,716 --> 00:02:10,684
Can't tell you.

60
00:02:10,752 --> 00:02:11,652
Is it something about me?

61
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:12,686
- Yes.
- Really?

62
00:02:12,754 --> 00:02:14,121
- No.
- Oh.

63
00:02:14,189 --> 00:02:15,722
Well, then I don't care.

64
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:16,823
- Well, good.
- Well, good.

65
00:02:19,528 --> 00:02:21,062
I do care. I can't think.
I'm not eating.

66
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:22,729
Kristin, tell me.
Tell me.

67
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:29,502
Hey, Mike Baxter here for outdoor man.

68
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,404
Thinking today about
the best part about hunting.

69
00:02:31,472 --> 00:02:33,106
Lot of good parts,
but the very best part--

70
00:02:33,174 --> 00:02:35,575
think about it--
when your gun jams.

71
00:02:35,642 --> 00:02:36,576
What? Gun jams?

72
00:02:36,643 --> 00:02:37,944
Yeah, think about it--

73
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:40,546
now you have a 500-pound black bear,

74
00:02:40,613 --> 00:02:41,980
who's kind of mad at you,

75
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,248
running right at you.</i>

76
00:02:43,316 --> 00:02:44,716
And you're thinking to yourself,

77
00:02:44,784 --> 00:02:48,253
"Huh. I don't think I'm gonna
make it through this."

78
00:02:48,321 --> 00:02:50,189
In that split second, you're going,

79
00:02:50,256 --> 00:02:53,024
"I'm gonna spend eternity now
with Marilyn Monroe,

80
00:02:53,093 --> 00:02:54,059
"Jesus,

81
00:02:54,127 --> 00:02:55,961
and most of Lynyrd Skynyrd."

82
00:02:57,162 --> 00:02:58,963
But your fortune changes.

83
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,465
Get a new cartridge back in that gun,

84
00:03:00,532 --> 00:03:02,933
you rack it, boom,
you pop off, hit the bear.

85
00:03:03,001 --> 00:03:05,570
Now he gets to spend eternity
with gentle Ben,

86
00:03:05,637 --> 00:03:07,338
bear Jesus,

87
00:03:07,406 --> 00:03:09,474
and most of the Country Bear Jamboree.</i>

88
00:03:10,942 --> 00:03:12,442
There's nothing like
the rush of adrenaline

89
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,177
to make you feel alive.

90
00:03:14,245 --> 00:03:15,479
Whether it's swimming with sharks,

91
00:03:15,546 --> 00:03:16,946
or if you're with your girlfriend,

92
00:03:17,014 --> 00:03:18,615
and all of a sudden, her husband
pulls in the driveway

93
00:03:18,682 --> 00:03:22,419
in his patrol car.

94
00:03:22,487 --> 00:03:25,555
You know, sadly, a lot of us
just don't feel this.

95
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:30,559
"Men lead lives of quiet desperation."

96
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,194
Thoreau.

97
00:03:32,262 --> 00:03:36,265
"Boredom is desire seeking desire."

98
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,266
Tolstoy.

99
00:03:37,334 --> 00:03:38,167
Communist.

100
00:03:39,836 --> 00:03:41,137
"Bored?

101
00:03:41,204 --> 00:03:42,671
"Get out of the basement,

102
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:46,141
put the comic books down,
and <i>do</i> something!"

103
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,408
Grammy.

104
00:03:51,847 --> 00:03:54,048
Mike, I wanna show you something here.

105
00:03:54,116 --> 00:03:57,185
I've been thinking of jazzing up
the retail space a little bit,

106
00:03:57,253 --> 00:03:58,286
to add some excitement here, you know?

107
00:03:58,354 --> 00:03:59,587
All right!
Yeah?

108
00:03:59,655 --> 00:04:01,421
Yeah, let's do it. Exciting.
What do you wanna do?

109
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:04,090
Well, I'm thinking of arranging
the fishing rods by height.

110
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,592
Huh? See? See?

111
00:04:07,362 --> 00:04:09,163
Not exciting enough, huh?

112
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,865
What do you say we blow something up?

113
00:04:11,932 --> 00:04:13,200
Yeah.

114
00:04:13,268 --> 00:04:14,701
Like what?

115
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:15,902
Like a bass boat.

116
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,037
We fill it with gasoline,

117
00:04:18,104 --> 00:04:19,338
we shoot it 50 feet in the air,

118
00:04:19,406 --> 00:04:20,873
the thing bursts into a fireball.

119
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,775
We'll sell a lot of somethin'.

120
00:04:22,842 --> 00:04:27,980
Could I ask you to reconsider
the fishing rod idea?

121
00:04:29,216 --> 00:04:30,216
Wrestling!

122
00:04:30,284 --> 00:04:32,651
We put a cage over by camping.

123
00:04:32,718 --> 00:04:34,852
People come in, they watch
greasy men beat each other up,

124
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,655
they'll buy <i>something.</i>

125
00:04:36,722 --> 00:04:37,789
Hmm.

126
00:04:37,856 --> 00:04:40,659
Or I could just send you to Brisbane.

127
00:04:40,726 --> 00:04:42,126
In Australia?

128
00:04:42,195 --> 00:04:44,829
Yeah, well, the hunting
and fishing expo's next month.

129
00:04:44,897 --> 00:04:47,065
- I know.
- And clearly, you're itching for some real excitement.

130
00:04:47,132 --> 00:04:49,733
Reward yourself with a trip.
Enjoy. Go on. Go on. Go on.

131
00:04:49,801 --> 00:04:52,369
Ah, I can't.

132
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:55,239
With Vanessa's promotion,

133
00:04:55,307 --> 00:04:58,942
I've been pickling up the slack at home.

134
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:02,145
Did you just say "pickling"?

135
00:05:02,214 --> 00:05:04,480
Did I?

136
00:05:04,548 --> 00:05:07,917
All right. All right.
Professional wrestlers it is.

137
00:05:07,984 --> 00:05:10,119
Okay, we'll put a couple
by the register.

138
00:05:10,187 --> 00:05:12,188
If you can defeat them,
you get 20% off your purchase.

139
00:05:12,256 --> 00:05:13,189
How's that?

140
00:05:13,257 --> 00:05:14,657
I don't think our customers

141
00:05:14,725 --> 00:05:16,626
should have to fight someone
to buy things.

142
00:05:16,694 --> 00:05:19,161
All right, just spitballing.
They're not all gems, right?

143
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,929
How about my NASCAR idea?

144
00:05:20,996 --> 00:05:23,798
No offense, but I think
you're past the age limit.

145
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:25,267
Besides, I drove in today,

146
00:05:25,335 --> 00:05:27,369
you were asleep in the car
with your blinker on.

147
00:05:27,437 --> 00:05:29,271
Aw, come on.
You know, I'm serious.

148
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:30,905
NASCAR's one of the biggest
sports in America.

149
00:05:30,973 --> 00:05:34,243
75 million fans. It'll be
a huge promotion for us.

150
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,810
Maybe not a bad idea.

151
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:37,712
We get a car, put it in our store,

152
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:39,447
people come in, fan appreciation day,

153
00:05:39,514 --> 00:05:40,881
we bring a lot of customers in.

154
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:42,450
I've known Tony Stewart for years.

155
00:05:42,517 --> 00:05:43,651
I'll give him a call.

156
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,519
Maybe we can get our logo on the car!

157
00:05:45,587 --> 00:05:47,821
All right! I love that,
I love that, I love that.

158
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,458
I've been looking for somewhere
to invest all that cash

159
00:05:50,525 --> 00:05:52,592
that I've got taped under my desk.

160
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,893
What?

161
00:05:53,961 --> 00:05:55,928
Nothin'.

162
00:05:57,164 --> 00:05:58,931
Tell me. Tell me.

163
00:05:58,999 --> 00:06:00,634
Tell me. Tell me.

164
00:06:00,701 --> 00:06:01,868
Tell me. Tell me.

165
00:06:01,935 --> 00:06:03,836
I listened to Boyd ask for a cookie

166
00:06:03,904 --> 00:06:05,705
for three straight hours yesterday.

167
00:06:05,773 --> 00:06:08,207
You really think you can break me?

168
00:06:08,275 --> 00:06:10,175
What if I tell you one of my secrets?

169
00:06:10,243 --> 00:06:13,412
You don't have any secrets.
You never shut up.

170
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,381
Not true. I shut up just long enough

171
00:06:15,448 --> 00:06:17,449
to hear a very juicy secret
about Jake Borelli

172
00:06:17,517 --> 00:06:21,119
and who he was making out with
in his grandma's motor home.

173
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,390
Okay.

174
00:06:25,457 --> 00:06:26,357
Who?

175
00:06:26,425 --> 00:06:27,425
You first.

176
00:06:30,095 --> 00:06:32,830
Okay, fine. But you cannot tell
Eve, because she'll tell mom.

177
00:06:32,898 --> 00:06:33,831
She's a rat.

178
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:34,999
I know. She's on her payroll.

179
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:37,735
That's why her allowance is so big.

180
00:06:37,803 --> 00:06:39,170
- Come on.
- Okay, okay.

181
00:06:39,237 --> 00:06:41,271
Okay, so a bunch of the girls
at work are going skydiving,

182
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:42,773
and I signed up, too.

183
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,973
You did what?

184
00:06:45,376 --> 00:06:47,010
Get in here.

185
00:06:49,681 --> 00:06:51,281
You cannot tell mom.

186
00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:52,916
She's the matriarch of the family.

187
00:06:52,983 --> 00:06:54,050
She's supposed to know everything.

188
00:06:54,118 --> 00:06:56,052
Here. Look.

189
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,421
That's me tap dancing in a tankini.

190
00:06:58,488 --> 00:07:00,255
Right. It is one click away
from going viral.

191
00:07:00,324 --> 00:07:01,490
- No, no! Stop!
- Watch me.

192
00:07:03,092 --> 00:07:04,927
Fine.

193
00:07:04,994 --> 00:07:06,128
I won't tell mom.

194
00:07:06,196 --> 00:07:07,663
Tell me what?

195
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:09,264
Uh, nothing.

196
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,434
What's with the third degree?
Where am I, GITMO?

197
00:07:16,772 --> 00:07:17,839
Hey.

198
00:07:17,906 --> 00:07:19,273
Hey!

199
00:07:19,342 --> 00:07:22,043
So I pulled out some steaks
for you and the girls.

200
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,645
- Why? Where are you going?
- Pickling.

201
00:07:23,713 --> 00:07:24,779
- Pickling?
- Yeah.

202
00:07:24,847 --> 00:07:25,980
Listen to yourself.

203
00:07:26,048 --> 00:07:27,582
You used to ski down black diamond hills

204
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:28,817
on one leg.

205
00:07:28,884 --> 00:07:30,885
Now you're putting vegetables in brine.

206
00:07:30,953 --> 00:07:32,987
And?

207
00:07:33,055 --> 00:07:35,389
Aren't you the woman that got
kicked out of a national park

208
00:07:35,457 --> 00:07:39,126
for kayaking down
a waterfall <i>buck naked?</i>

209
00:07:39,194 --> 00:07:40,594
I know what this is.
I know.

210
00:07:40,662 --> 00:07:42,330
You're upset about something,

211
00:07:42,397 --> 00:07:44,865
and you are not gonna be happy
until I am upset, too.

212
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:47,667
But it's not gonna work,
because I am very happy.

213
00:07:47,735 --> 00:07:49,035
- Pickling?
- Yeah, pickling. I enjoy it.

214
00:07:49,103 --> 00:07:50,904
- Just like an old woman.
- No, that's not gonna work.

215
00:07:50,972 --> 00:07:52,739
Yeah? Where you taking your classes?

216
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,440
The senior center.

217
00:07:56,878 --> 00:07:59,346
Congratulations!
I am now upset!

218
00:08:06,716 --> 00:08:09,584
Okay, guys, we're all set.
Tony Stewart's car is here.

219
00:08:09,704 --> 00:08:11,171
How'd you get it in so fast?

220
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:12,573
Curly and the guys.

221
00:08:12,641 --> 00:08:14,375
They help me push it in
through the elephant doors.

222
00:08:14,442 --> 00:08:16,877
- Yeah, well, where's Tony?
- He said he had to pee like a race car.

223
00:08:16,944 --> 00:08:19,780
Then he started laughing.

224
00:08:19,847 --> 00:08:21,114
Let's see it!

225
00:08:21,182 --> 00:08:23,416
Come on. I can't wait to see the logo!

226
00:08:23,484 --> 00:08:24,950
Come on.

227
00:08:25,986 --> 00:08:28,454
Wow. (Laughs) Look at that.

228
00:08:28,522 --> 00:08:30,356
Ooh.

229
00:08:30,424 --> 00:08:31,758
Where's the logo?

230
00:08:31,825 --> 00:08:33,025
Kyle, show him.

231
00:08:33,093 --> 00:08:34,394
- It's over here.
- Huh?

232
00:08:36,597 --> 00:08:38,798
It's right... there.

233
00:08:38,865 --> 00:08:42,734
There it is! There it is!
Outdoor man.

234
00:08:42,802 --> 00:08:44,469
Somehow, I thought it might be bigger.

235
00:08:45,938 --> 00:08:47,238
Looks pretty good.

236
00:08:47,307 --> 00:08:50,409
I can cover it with my thumb.

237
00:08:50,476 --> 00:08:53,679
And the Basque are not
known for large thumbs.

238
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:58,849
Well, how you doing, Smoke?

239
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:00,150
How you doing, Choke?

240
00:09:00,218 --> 00:09:01,819
Good to see you.

241
00:09:01,886 --> 00:09:03,020
"Choke"?

242
00:09:03,087 --> 00:09:05,055
What, did you get
all nervous and freeze up?

243
00:09:05,123 --> 00:09:06,524
No, I actually choked someone

244
00:09:06,591 --> 00:09:08,592
'cause they asked me a stupid question.

245
00:09:13,197 --> 00:09:15,097
Uh, Tony Stewart, this is
our C.E.O., Ed Alzate.

246
00:09:15,165 --> 00:09:16,733
A pleasure.
Question, Tony, please.

247
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:18,034
Come on.

248
00:09:18,101 --> 00:09:22,405
Um, any way to make
this logo a little bigger?

249
00:09:22,473 --> 00:09:24,207
Well, it's not really my area.

250
00:09:24,274 --> 00:09:26,609
I see, but the--
the car's your area, right?

251
00:09:26,677 --> 00:09:28,777
- Right.
- And the logo is on the car?

252
00:09:28,845 --> 00:09:31,847
Uh, how--how could
that not be your area?

253
00:09:31,914 --> 00:09:35,517
Ed, Ed... dial it back
a little bit, all right?

254
00:09:35,585 --> 00:09:38,119
Forget it. He's all hopped up
on jelly beans.

255
00:09:38,187 --> 00:09:40,956
Listen, I'm doing you
a huge favor here, Choke.

256
00:09:41,023 --> 00:09:43,458
This isn't a show car.
This is the real deal.

257
00:09:43,525 --> 00:09:45,360
Won the sprint cup title in this baby.

258
00:09:45,427 --> 00:09:46,594
I really appreciate it.

259
00:09:46,662 --> 00:09:47,928
You know, and it's lucky for you

260
00:09:47,996 --> 00:09:49,530
I was busy that day,
'cause I think I probably

261
00:09:49,598 --> 00:09:51,699
could have taken you in my pickup truck.

262
00:09:51,767 --> 00:09:53,067
I can drive in reverse

263
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,135
faster than you can drive
that old milk truck.

264
00:09:55,203 --> 00:09:57,238
That old milk truck
is a classic, you know?

265
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,639
Much like your haircut.

266
00:10:01,275 --> 00:10:03,577
Listen, just don't let anybody touch it

267
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:06,212
and lean on it and sit in it.

268
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,449
And especially, most of all,
don't let anybody kiss the hood.

269
00:10:09,517 --> 00:10:10,751
Kiss the hood?

270
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:11,918
Especially you.

271
00:10:14,221 --> 00:10:15,755
Anyway, what time you need me back here?

272
00:10:15,822 --> 00:10:17,189
Uh, show's at 4:00.

273
00:10:17,257 --> 00:10:18,524
Why don't you get back here
at 3:30 for some prep?

274
00:10:18,592 --> 00:10:19,558
We got a big crowd showing up.

275
00:10:19,626 --> 00:10:20,459
Sounds good.
I'll see you then.

276
00:10:20,527 --> 00:10:21,594
See you later, bud.

277
00:10:21,661 --> 00:10:24,430
Oh, this is some machine.

278
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,898
Yeah, yeah. If I were younger,

279
00:10:25,965 --> 00:10:27,833
I'd be out in the parking lot
doing doughnuts in it.

280
00:10:27,901 --> 00:10:30,102
Even if you wanted to, this thing won't turn on.

281
00:10:30,169 --> 00:10:33,137
Oh, butch up, Mildred.

282
00:10:33,205 --> 00:10:35,339
All you'd have to do
is attach the battery,

283
00:10:35,408 --> 00:10:37,776
and then you just...
Flip the old kill switch.

284
00:10:37,843 --> 00:10:40,077
There you go, huh?

285
00:10:40,145 --> 00:10:43,281
Boy, driving this thing is like
being strapped to a missile.

286
00:10:43,348 --> 00:10:46,083
Yeah. A 900-horsepower missile.

287
00:10:46,151 --> 00:10:47,918
Can you imagine that?

288
00:10:47,985 --> 00:10:49,887
With 42 other cars right behind you?

289
00:10:49,954 --> 00:10:53,457
Going around Talladega?
Over 200 miles an hour? Yeah!

290
00:10:53,525 --> 00:10:54,991
Wow, huh?

291
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:56,660
Yeah.

292
00:10:56,728 --> 00:10:59,262
I don't really get it.

293
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,097
What don't you get?

294
00:11:01,165 --> 00:11:03,199
Oh, no, I think the car's pretty cool.

295
00:11:03,267 --> 00:11:05,034
I just don't get
the whole appeal of racing.

296
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:07,403
It's about endurance, man and machine.

297
00:11:07,471 --> 00:11:09,739
Come on. These guys
are flying around the track,

298
00:11:09,807 --> 00:11:11,607
sometimes they're hitting 3 G's.

299
00:11:11,675 --> 00:11:13,876
3 G's! That's the same amount of G's

300
00:11:13,944 --> 00:11:17,947
as astronauts feel when
they take off on a rocket.

301
00:11:18,014 --> 00:11:20,181
Wow.

302
00:11:20,249 --> 00:11:21,983
Just wish our name was bigger.

303
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:30,391
I'm thinking about pickling a radish.

304
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,026
Is that crazy?
Tell me it's crazy.

305
00:11:33,228 --> 00:11:35,096
Hmm? What?

306
00:11:35,164 --> 00:11:37,665
I, uh...
Oh, no. No, no. No.

307
00:11:37,732 --> 00:11:38,966
You're distracted.

308
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:41,034
A little.

309
00:11:41,102 --> 00:11:42,536
I mean--
just I...

310
00:11:42,604 --> 00:11:44,404
I was once a black diamond skier.

311
00:11:44,473 --> 00:11:46,206
I kayaked over a waterfall,

312
00:11:46,274 --> 00:11:49,042
I even repelled down the face
of Lincoln on mount Rushmore.

313
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,678
And now I-I-I go to work,

314
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:54,447
I raise kids, I-I pickle.

315
00:11:54,515 --> 00:11:56,883
I pickle things I don't even like.

316
00:11:56,951 --> 00:11:58,150
- You know what you need?
- What?

317
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,087
Bangs.

318
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:04,023
I really think your forehead
could pull it off.

319
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:05,091
Everybody down!

320
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:07,493
You! Down!

321
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,561
Vanessa! He said to get down!

322
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:11,262
He was very specific!

323
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,430
Down!

324
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,335
Lady, do you have a problem?

325
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,071
Yeah. You're my problem.

326
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,206
Ooh!

327
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:22,140
Uhh!

328
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:28,779
Drop it.

329
00:12:38,456 --> 00:12:40,189
Too slow.

330
00:12:41,659 --> 00:12:43,760
<i>Mom. Mom!</i>

331
00:12:43,828 --> 00:12:46,763
Too slow.

332
00:12:46,831 --> 00:12:47,964
Mom!

333
00:12:48,032 --> 00:12:49,766
Hmm? What?

334
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:50,934
Your friend is on the phone.

335
00:12:51,002 --> 00:12:51,902
What?

336
00:12:51,969 --> 00:12:53,136
You know, Michelle,

337
00:12:53,203 --> 00:12:57,673
the one that dad says
looks like a robot.

338
00:12:57,741 --> 00:12:59,975
Yeah, hi.
Hi, Michelle.

339
00:13:00,043 --> 00:13:01,744
What? Oh, yeah.
I-I'll meet you there.

340
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:04,112
Oh, my gosh. Wow.

341
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,280
- Mm.
- Mom.

342
00:13:05,348 --> 00:13:06,782
Hmm? What?

343
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,017
Nothing.

344
00:13:08,084 --> 00:13:09,018
Wh-what?
What is it, honey?

345
00:13:09,085 --> 00:13:11,020
I can't tell you.

346
00:13:11,087 --> 00:13:13,354
I'm afraid I'll crack
if you keep asking me...

347
00:13:13,422 --> 00:13:16,190
If-- if you keep asking me.

348
00:13:16,258 --> 00:13:17,525
Well, is-- is it about school?

349
00:13:17,593 --> 00:13:18,893
No.
Mandy?

350
00:13:18,961 --> 00:13:19,928
No.
Kristin?

351
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,233
What is it about Kristin?

352
00:13:26,301 --> 00:13:28,368
Look, I-I can't tell you.

353
00:13:28,436 --> 00:13:30,437
I'd sooner jump out of an airplane

354
00:13:30,504 --> 00:13:32,906
with a bunch of <i>waitresses</i>
before I told you.

355
00:13:32,974 --> 00:13:34,875
Is Kristin skydiving?

356
00:13:34,943 --> 00:13:37,310
I can't tell you.

357
00:13:37,378 --> 00:13:39,179
Good girl.

358
00:13:42,349 --> 00:13:43,683
He said not to do this.

359
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,250
I don't care.
I want to kiss the hood.

360
00:13:45,318 --> 00:13:47,086
He put the thought in my head.

361
00:14:05,935 --> 00:14:08,037
"Dear sirs, by now you've
probably noticed that

362
00:14:08,104 --> 00:14:09,804
"the race car is missing.
That's because I took it.

363
00:14:09,872 --> 00:14:12,273
Warmest regards, Kyle."

364
00:14:12,341 --> 00:14:13,908
If Tony comes back, that car isn't here,

365
00:14:13,975 --> 00:14:14,975
we'll lose the endorsement.

366
00:14:15,044 --> 00:14:16,010
Yeah.

367
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:21,916
Kyle speaking.

368
00:14:21,983 --> 00:14:23,284
Kyle, where are you?

369
00:14:23,352 --> 00:14:24,652
Oh, I wanted to try some of
those doughnut things

370
00:14:24,719 --> 00:14:26,220
you were talking about.

371
00:14:26,288 --> 00:14:27,620
But I can't get it in gear.
I think it's stuck.

372
00:14:27,688 --> 00:14:28,821
Where <i>are</i> you?

373
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:29,789
North parking lot.

374
00:14:29,857 --> 00:14:31,091
Stay there. I'm coming.

375
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,492
Okay, you can't miss me.

376
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,028
I'm standing right next
to a bright red race car.

377
00:14:35,096 --> 00:14:36,729
Hello?

378
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:43,702
Oh, my God.

379
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:47,406
My heart is pounding so hard.

380
00:14:47,474 --> 00:14:48,941
Alpha team!
You're up next.

381
00:14:49,008 --> 00:14:50,543
Let's make our way to the staging area.

382
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:51,477
Hustle up! Let's go!

383
00:14:54,647 --> 00:14:56,415
Kristin! Honey!

384
00:14:56,483 --> 00:14:58,117
Mom?

385
00:14:58,185 --> 00:14:59,284
Ugh! Eve!

386
00:14:59,351 --> 00:15:00,985
Yeah, yeah, Eve told me!

387
00:15:01,053 --> 00:15:02,420
And you should have, too!

388
00:15:02,488 --> 00:15:04,322
I know, but...

389
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,157
Mom, it's not fair!

390
00:15:06,225 --> 00:15:09,427
Everybody else gets to have
all of this fun and excitement,

391
00:15:09,495 --> 00:15:11,662
and I don't.

392
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,565
Honey, listen, I know.
I know it's not fair.

393
00:15:13,632 --> 00:15:15,265
And trust me, when I had you,

394
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,766
I gave up a lot of stuff, too,

395
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:18,868
like-- like smoking and bar fights

396
00:15:18,936 --> 00:15:20,270
and fatty food.

397
00:15:20,338 --> 00:15:22,672
I-- whoa. I'm-- did you say "bar fights"?

398
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,373
Look-- it-- look,

399
00:15:24,441 --> 00:15:26,910
the-- the point is...
Is you are an adult.

400
00:15:26,978 --> 00:15:28,845
And you're a role model.

401
00:15:28,913 --> 00:15:31,615
And-- and you have to think
of more than just yourself.

402
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:32,649
- I know that, and I do.
- Yeah.

403
00:15:32,717 --> 00:15:34,584
But it's just...
Being responsible

404
00:15:34,652 --> 00:15:36,820
doesn't mean never having any fun.

405
00:15:36,887 --> 00:15:39,387
Honey, that's exactly what it means.

406
00:15:39,455 --> 00:15:42,524
I don't really think
that you believe that.

407
00:15:42,592 --> 00:15:44,927
Well...

408
00:15:44,995 --> 00:15:47,896
I do. I do. Yes.
That is what I believe.

409
00:15:47,964 --> 00:15:49,364
Do it with me.

410
00:15:49,432 --> 00:15:50,465
<i>What?</i>

411
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,067
Yeah. Come on.
You should jump with me.

412
00:15:52,135 --> 00:15:53,435
- Come on, mom, it's gonna be awesome.
- I know,

413
00:15:53,503 --> 00:15:55,236
but that would make me
a total hypocrite!

414
00:15:55,303 --> 00:15:57,939
So? Would you rather be
a big old bore? Come on!

415
00:15:58,007 --> 00:15:59,440
- Come on.
- Ladies! Last chance!

416
00:15:59,508 --> 00:16:00,708
Who's jumping?

417
00:16:00,776 --> 00:16:02,409
Yeah. You heard him.
Last chance, ladies.

418
00:16:02,477 --> 00:16:03,477
Who's jumping? Come on.

419
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,346
No, you go. You go.

420
00:16:05,413 --> 00:16:06,547
Go. Have fun.

421
00:16:06,615 --> 00:16:07,515
You sure?

422
00:16:07,582 --> 00:16:09,050
Go.

423
00:16:09,118 --> 00:16:10,884
Okay.

424
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:26,366
Hey! Smoke! You're early!

425
00:16:26,433 --> 00:16:27,767
Yeah, it's just kind of my thing.

426
00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:29,268
I wanna check on my race car.

427
00:16:29,335 --> 00:16:30,936
Kind of miss her when we're apart.

428
00:16:31,004 --> 00:16:32,972
Yeah, of course.
Oh, she's a beauty!

429
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,374
But first, why don't we go upstairs?

430
00:16:35,441 --> 00:16:37,609
I'll show you the gun
that killed Hemingway.

431
00:16:37,678 --> 00:16:38,644
Huh? Come on.

432
00:16:38,712 --> 00:16:39,945
I just wanna check on my race car.

433
00:16:40,013 --> 00:16:42,414
Yeah, hang on. What kind
of host would I be

434
00:16:42,482 --> 00:16:45,083
if I didn't load you down
with premium outdoor man swag?

435
00:16:45,151 --> 00:16:46,718
- Huh?
- Ah, it's not necessary.

436
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:48,486
Of course not, but...
Just one question.

437
00:16:48,554 --> 00:16:49,721
One question.

438
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:52,991
Uh, what size
snowshoes do you wear? Hmm?

439
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:55,994
I really don't wear snowshoes.

440
00:16:56,062 --> 00:16:58,729
- You don't wear snowshoes?
- No.

441
00:16:58,797 --> 00:17:01,098
Let's go to the warehouse.

442
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,400
You haven't lived until
you've trudged laboriously

443
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:05,202
through hip-deep snow, man.

444
00:17:05,269 --> 00:17:06,670
But I don't wear snowshoes.

445
00:17:06,738 --> 00:17:08,906
They go with everything.

446
00:17:11,442 --> 00:17:13,744
You know, Kyle, of all
the dumb things you've done,

447
00:17:13,812 --> 00:17:15,311
this is the dumbest.

448
00:17:15,378 --> 00:17:16,979
That may not be true.

449
00:17:17,047 --> 00:17:18,614
One time, I took my mom's cat Dorothy

450
00:17:18,682 --> 00:17:19,648
to a rookies game.

451
00:17:19,717 --> 00:17:22,085
Kyle, this isn't a talk show.

452
00:17:22,152 --> 00:17:25,354
Listen, we gotta get this car
back through the elephant doors.

453
00:17:25,422 --> 00:17:27,090
You push, I'm gonna steer.

454
00:17:27,157 --> 00:17:29,192
No can do. I tweaked my back.

455
00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:30,826
You'll just have to drive it.

456
00:17:30,893 --> 00:17:32,460
I'm not driving this.

457
00:17:32,528 --> 00:17:34,395
Look, Mr. B.,

458
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,964
I saw the way you looked at this thing,

459
00:17:36,032 --> 00:17:37,265
and I know you can start it.

460
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:38,399
I'm not gonna drive it.

461
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:40,168
I dare you.

462
00:17:42,504 --> 00:17:45,907
I don't know much about you,
but I do know this--

463
00:17:45,975 --> 00:17:47,407
you love your family,

464
00:17:47,475 --> 00:17:49,309
you enjoy your life,

465
00:17:49,377 --> 00:17:50,745
and every now and then,
you need to do something

466
00:17:50,812 --> 00:17:52,079
you're probably gonna regret.

467
00:17:52,147 --> 00:17:54,448
This is that moment.

468
00:17:57,819 --> 00:17:59,787
I'm gonna start this car,

469
00:17:59,855 --> 00:18:02,056
I'm gonna drive this car,

470
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:03,522
and if I don't get killed in this car,

471
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,892
I'm gonna get out of the car
and kick your ass.

472
00:18:07,161 --> 00:18:10,163
I expect nothing less, sir.

473
00:18:10,231 --> 00:18:11,364
You might wanna back away.

474
00:18:42,395 --> 00:18:44,696
Look out below!

475
00:18:44,764 --> 00:18:46,964
Whoo-hoo!

476
00:18:47,032 --> 00:18:49,334
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

477
00:18:49,402 --> 00:18:50,902
Whoo!

478
00:18:50,969 --> 00:18:52,503
Try these goggles.

479
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,371
They won't fog, even in fog.

480
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:55,739
I just wanna see the car.

481
00:18:55,807 --> 00:18:57,308
Yes, of course.
How would you like to see

482
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,310
the loading dock, huh? You like
boxes, right? Don't you?

483
00:18:59,377 --> 00:19:00,344
No, don't touch that.

484
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:06,983
Hey, Tony, how's it going?

485
00:19:07,051 --> 00:19:08,451
We were...
We were just looking at...

486
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:10,386
The... this, uh...
Side of the car.

487
00:19:10,454 --> 00:19:11,987
It's nice.
You know, it's...

488
00:19:12,055 --> 00:19:14,123
You know, the car, which is
right back where you left it.

489
00:19:14,191 --> 00:19:15,792
And there's no reason
to suspect otherwise.

490
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:17,493
No.
None whatsoever.

491
00:19:17,561 --> 00:19:19,429
- I think I've got a new passion for racing, actually--
- Whoa!

492
00:19:19,496 --> 00:19:20,896
You know, there's a whole shipment of

493
00:19:20,964 --> 00:19:22,398
"shut the hell up" downstairs.
Why don't you unload it?

494
00:19:22,466 --> 00:19:24,065
Got it.

495
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:26,668
Kids.

496
00:19:26,736 --> 00:19:29,371
You drove the car, didn't you, Mikey?

497
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:31,272
Oh, come on.
What'd you expect?

498
00:19:31,341 --> 00:19:34,142
It was like putting a hot
apple pie in a windowsill.

499
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,744
Give me the keys to your truck.

500
00:19:35,812 --> 00:19:37,178
Why?

501
00:19:37,246 --> 00:19:38,413
Well, you did doughnuts in my car,

502
00:19:38,481 --> 00:19:40,047
I'm gonna do doughnuts in your truck.

503
00:19:40,114 --> 00:19:41,915
I don't think that's a good
idea. It's an old classic.

504
00:19:41,983 --> 00:19:43,551
It-- you'd flip it or something.

505
00:19:43,618 --> 00:19:46,920
Yeah, but that possibility
is exactly what makes it fun.

506
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,090
Uh, really, it's not the same thing.

507
00:19:50,158 --> 00:19:52,192
You know, and really,
nobody drives my truck but me.

508
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,627
Tony, I understand how you feel.

509
00:19:53,695 --> 00:19:55,628
Just a second here. But two
wrongs do not make a right.

510
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:57,797
I'm with Mike on this one.
I have to back him up.

511
00:19:57,865 --> 00:20:00,633
I'll double the size of that logo.

512
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:02,168
Mike, give him your keys.

513
00:20:11,851 --> 00:20:12,850
Hi.

514
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:14,251
Oh, good.
You stopped her.

515
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:15,919
Actually, she didn't.

516
00:20:15,987 --> 00:20:17,655
You let her jump?

517
00:20:17,723 --> 00:20:19,256
I had to keep a close eye on her.

518
00:20:20,425 --> 00:20:22,292
You jumped, too?

519
00:20:22,361 --> 00:20:24,462
Yeah, it's possible.

520
00:20:24,529 --> 00:20:25,996
I've been sitting here racked with guilt

521
00:20:26,064 --> 00:20:27,465
that I betrayed a secret!

522
00:20:27,532 --> 00:20:29,532
I-I've barely been able to study!

523
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,701
I mean, the teacher said we
wouldn't be tested on this,

524
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:32,736
but it could be a trick.

525
00:20:32,803 --> 00:20:34,738
Oh, honey, Eve...

526
00:20:34,805 --> 00:20:37,540
Listen to me, sweetheart...

527
00:20:37,608 --> 00:20:39,709
Sweetheart, you are
a good and responsible person.

528
00:20:39,777 --> 00:20:42,545
It's very important.
But, Evie...

529
00:20:42,613 --> 00:20:45,681
Sometimes it's also important
to just... live a little!

530
00:20:45,749 --> 00:20:48,149
Mom used to get into bar fights!

531
00:20:48,217 --> 00:20:50,986
Ugh! Come on. Can no one
keep a secret in this house?

532
00:20:51,053 --> 00:20:52,220
Come on, Eve.

533
00:20:52,288 --> 00:20:53,789
I wanna show you the video of our jump.

534
00:20:53,857 --> 00:20:55,824
Not interested.

535
00:20:55,892 --> 00:20:57,000
Mom hit a bird on the way down.

536
00:20:58,127 --> 00:20:59,419
Now I'm interested.

537
00:21:01,229 --> 00:21:03,030
Come on!

538
00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:06,100
Wow.

539
00:21:06,167 --> 00:21:09,437
Oh. Whoo.

540
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,108
Hmm.

541
00:21:14,175 --> 00:21:17,343
- Hey, V., V., V.!
- Oh, honey! Honey!

542
00:21:17,412 --> 00:21:18,879
I did something crazy today.

543
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:20,213
I did something really crazy, too.

544
00:21:20,281 --> 00:21:21,648
I took Tony Stewart's car
out in the parking lot

545
00:21:21,716 --> 00:21:23,650
and did doughnuts!
In a NASCAR! Doughnuts!

546
00:21:23,718 --> 00:21:26,486
I jumped out of a plane!

547
00:21:26,554 --> 00:21:27,954
- Bedroom?
- Kids.

548
00:21:28,022 --> 00:21:28,889
Bomb shelter!

549
00:21:30,993 --> 00:21:33,641
