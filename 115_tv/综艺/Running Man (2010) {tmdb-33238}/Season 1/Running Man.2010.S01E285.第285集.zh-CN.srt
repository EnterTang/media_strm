(Beware of ambush and protect your name tag.)

(Beginning now, until you enter the waiting room, you are vulnerable.)

11
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.932
(What is this?)

12
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.115
Who?

13
00:01:13.653 --> 00:01:14.728
I don't know.

14
00:01:14.943 --> 00:01:16.018
Who is after it?

15
00:01:16.631 --> 00:01:18.287
(Who's after my name tag?)

16
00:01:18.383 --> 00:01:19.856
Someone's after my name tag?

17
00:01:21.394 --> 00:01:22.469
Is it you?

18
00:01:22.684 --> 00:01:23.867
You're after my name tag, right?

19
00:01:24.405 --> 00:01:26.770
It's you, isn't it?

20
00:01:26.985 --> 00:01:28.705
Is it attached properly?

21
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.146
Don't worry, I have it on me.

22
00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:34.404
(Someone is after your name tag.)

23
00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.167
If it's until I enter the waiting room,

24
00:01:38.135 --> 00:01:39.350
then has it begun already?

25
00:01:39.457 --> 00:01:43.543
(The game starts now.)

26
00:01:43.941 --> 00:01:45.801
(He looks behind.)

27
00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.607
(He is suddenly frightened.)

28
00:01:53.435 --> 00:01:54.940
(Who? Who's after my name tag?)

29
00:01:55.048 --> 00:02:00.424
(Why? Now? Just me?)

30
00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:02.144
Where's the waiting room?

31
00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.832
Someone's going to ambush me?

32
00:02:05.413 --> 00:02:06.488
Oh, my.

33
00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:09.671
Really?

34
00:02:09.778 --> 00:02:10.961
(Really?)

35
00:02:11.068 --> 00:02:13.154
Wait. What about my hair?

36
00:02:13.434 --> 00:02:16.444
I need to put some makeup on first.

37
00:02:18.025 --> 00:02:19.100
Wait.

38
00:02:19.778 --> 00:02:20.960
Am I targeted constantly?

39
00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:22.466
(Am I targeted constantly?)

40
00:02:22.573 --> 00:02:24.874
Then can I knock the person out?

41
00:02:25.154 --> 00:02:26.229
Is that all right?

42
00:02:26.766 --> 00:02:28.992
I've been doing this for years.

43
00:02:29.067 --> 00:02:31.035
Ripping my name tag off won't be so easy.

44
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.755
Today is going to be...

45
00:02:33.863 --> 00:02:35.798
(He begins to workout all of a sudden.)

46
00:02:35.906 --> 00:02:36.981
This will be fun.

47
00:02:37.486 --> 00:02:40.206
Until I reach the waiting room? Where is the waiting room?

48
00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:44.830
(All members have received the mission.)

49
00:02:46.271 --> 00:02:49.604
(Test No. 1: Agility Test, The observation begins.)

50
00:02:51.754 --> 00:02:57.517
(Kwang Soo is quick to betray.)

51
00:02:58.238 --> 00:02:59.420
What's going on?

52
00:03:03.291 --> 00:03:07.302
It's my first time coming here for makeup.

53
00:03:08.592 --> 00:03:11.065
Someone's after me even in this moment?

54
00:03:11.172 --> 00:03:12.678
(Kwang Soo is very anxious from the beginning.)

55
00:03:12.785 --> 00:03:15.151
It's my first time ever coming here. Who would know I'm here?

56
00:03:15.258 --> 00:03:16.871
(Kwang Soo is very anxious from the beginning.)

57
00:03:17.946 --> 00:03:18.914
Who?

58
00:03:19.021 --> 00:03:20.097
(Who?)

59
00:03:21.494 --> 00:03:22.462
Is it you?

60
00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.182
(Is it you?)

61
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.010
I won't put up with it today.

62
00:03:26.085 --> 00:03:27.623
(I won't put up with it today.)

63
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.419
You're on my radar too.

64
00:03:29.494 --> 00:03:31.279
(The cameraman is also on his list.)

65
00:03:33.397 --> 00:03:35.794
(Or maybe there's a guest waiting upstairs.)

66
00:03:35.902 --> 00:03:37.085
Starting now?

67
00:03:39.988 --> 00:03:41.601
Hello. Nice to meet you.

68
00:03:41.708 --> 00:03:42.783
Hello.

69
00:03:43.106 --> 00:03:45.041
- Please take a seat. - Hello.

70
00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:47.407
(It is his first time at this hair salon.)

71
00:03:47.482 --> 00:03:49.665
- Isn't it cold outside? - Yes.

72
00:03:49.772 --> 00:03:51.783
(Most of the people here are complete strangers.)

73
00:03:51.858 --> 00:03:54.288
(Thank goodness.)

74
00:03:57.944 --> 00:04:00.847
(After I get my hair done fast...)

75
00:04:00.954 --> 00:04:02.890
(and enter the waiting room...)

76
00:04:02.997 --> 00:04:04.363
It's nice to meet you.

77
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.760
(What?)

78
00:04:09.878 --> 00:04:11.814
Hold on!

79
00:04:11.921 --> 00:04:14.394
(He was caught off guard.)

80
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.685
No, wait.

81
00:04:15.792 --> 00:04:17.297
(Now this is what we call a test of agility.)

82
00:04:17.405 --> 00:04:20.308
(The agent can go after the name tag for 10 seconds.)

83
00:04:20.415 --> 00:04:21.383
Who are you?

84
00:04:21.491 --> 00:04:22.641
(Who are you?)

85
00:04:23.856 --> 00:04:26.006
(The 10 seconds is up.)

86
00:04:26.114 --> 00:04:27.189
I fended him off.

87
00:04:27.727 --> 00:04:28.802
I blocked him.

88
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.726
(Kwang Soo is surprisingly agile.)

89
00:04:35.146 --> 00:04:36.543
Excuse me. Who are you?

90
00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:38.909
(Who are you?)

91
00:04:38.984 --> 00:04:39.984
Do you work here?

92
00:04:40.102 --> 00:04:41.457
(Yes)

93
00:04:41.532 --> 00:04:43.210
- Do you really work here? - Yes.

94
00:04:44.823 --> 00:04:46.328
(You're really good.)

95
00:04:47.091 --> 00:04:48.801
I've been at this for six years.

96
00:04:49.338 --> 00:04:50.414
I'm sorry.

97
00:04:52.134 --> 00:04:53.209
Oh, my.

98
00:04:54.467 --> 00:04:55.575
He's a complete stranger.

99
00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:57.725
What's going on?

100
00:04:58.736 --> 00:05:00.628
(Please sit here.)

101
00:05:00.736 --> 00:05:02.961
I'm sorry, but could you please stand over there?

102
00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:04.391
I'm very on edge today.

103
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.370
(He sinks down to protect his name tag.)

104
00:05:08.477 --> 00:05:09.552
Yes.

105
00:05:09.982 --> 00:05:11.058
What?

106
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.530
(What is happening?)

107
00:05:13.638 --> 00:05:14.928
What is this?

108
00:05:16.122 --> 00:05:18.014
I think I was quite cool just now.

109
00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:23.250
(Surprisingly agile. Potential is unknown but is simple-minded.)

110
00:05:25.401 --> 00:05:28.691
(Seok Jin is full of confidence.)

111
00:05:28.766 --> 00:05:31.777
I can't trust anyone.

112
00:05:31.852 --> 00:05:33.207
(I can't trust anyone.)

113
00:05:33.325 --> 00:05:34.604
Who are you?

114
00:05:34.895 --> 00:05:37.400
Please go first.

115
00:05:37.626 --> 00:05:39.658
Are you going down or up?

116
00:05:39.776 --> 00:05:42.346
You're going up? Then it's fine.

117
00:05:42.464 --> 00:05:43.894
(He needlessly yells at his neighbours.)

118
00:05:45.357 --> 00:05:47.120
This is...

119
00:05:47.303 --> 00:05:48.797
(He is startled.)

120
00:05:50.528 --> 00:05:54.248
(Seok Jin is easily scared.)

121
00:05:55.614 --> 00:05:59.657
(Gary has keen senses.)

122
00:06:00.624 --> 00:06:03.280
Is there another person in this?

123
00:06:03.635 --> 00:06:04.818
(Running)

124
00:06:04.893 --> 00:06:06.108
You startled me.

125
00:06:06.538 --> 00:06:08.334
(He was very startled.)

126
00:06:11.054 --> 00:06:13.742
(Haha is great with tricks.)

127
00:06:13.817 --> 00:06:14.892
Excuse me.

128
00:06:15.247 --> 00:06:16.430
You're not a spy, are you?

129
00:06:16.537 --> 00:06:17.828
(You're not a spy, are you?)

130
00:06:17.935 --> 00:06:19.548
What are you filming?

131
00:06:21.376 --> 00:06:23.096
I have a weird feeling about this.

132
00:06:23.204 --> 00:06:25.139
(If these people are actors, it's not safe here.)

133
00:06:25.214 --> 00:06:26.290
Are you really a couple?

134
00:06:26.967 --> 00:06:28.150
Are you?

135
00:06:28.257 --> 00:06:29.655
Aren't you strangers?

136
00:06:29.762 --> 00:06:30.988
No.

137
00:06:31.913 --> 00:06:35.999
Really? I am a bit on edge today.

138
00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:37.826
If you're a real couple, could you hold hands?

139
00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:39.332
Can you kiss her hand?

140
00:06:39.805 --> 00:06:40.837
(He pecks her hand.)

141
00:06:40.945 --> 00:06:43.493
- You're a great actor. - No, that's not true.

142
00:06:44.568 --> 00:06:45.643
Aren't we a fine couple?

143
00:06:45.966 --> 00:06:47.331
You are a great couple, but...

144
00:06:47.471 --> 00:06:49.116
(Something's strange.)

145
00:06:49.224 --> 00:06:50.836
There's something fishy going on.

146
00:06:57.008 --> 00:06:58.223
Are you really the chef here?

147
00:06:58.761 --> 00:07:00.051
- Are you? - Yes.

148
00:07:00.126 --> 00:07:02.341
- Are you really sure? - Yes.

149
00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:03.631
(He doubts everything.)

150
00:07:03.922 --> 00:07:04.997
Excuse me,

151
00:07:05.137 --> 00:07:06.642
how long have you worked here?

152
00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:08.900
- I started just today. - You started today. I knew it.

153
00:07:09.007 --> 00:07:10.083
It's strange, right?

154
00:07:11.265 --> 00:07:13.308
You don't usually wear glasses, do you?

155
00:07:13.416 --> 00:07:15.566
Are you filming me with your glasses?

156
00:07:17.716 --> 00:07:19.297
(Haha doubts everyone.)

157
00:07:19.372 --> 00:07:21.265
I got goosebumps all over.

158
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.308
I'm serious.

159
00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.781
I'm scared.

160
00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:31.372
The gym isn't usually this crowded in the morning.

161
00:07:31.479 --> 00:07:33.597
There are so many people today.

162
00:07:35.608 --> 00:07:39.758
(Who is brave enough to go after Jong Kook's name tag?)

163
00:07:39.833 --> 00:07:41.263
(He is startled.)

164
00:07:41.371 --> 00:07:43.167
Who is this person?

165
00:07:43.242 --> 00:07:44.274
There's something fishy about him.

166
00:07:44.382 --> 00:07:45.457
(There's something fishy about him.)

167
00:07:46.102 --> 00:07:47.392
Why are there...

168
00:07:47.822 --> 00:07:49.220
so many...

169
00:07:49.327 --> 00:07:51.048
suspicious people in the gym today?

170
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.876
This is strange.

171
00:07:52.951 --> 00:07:54.026
(His radar is on.)

172
00:07:57.499 --> 00:07:59.327
(Someone suddenly appears.)

173
00:07:59.434 --> 00:08:00.660
Goodness.

174
00:08:00.768 --> 00:08:02.983
What are you doing?

175
00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:04.165
Why are you doing this?

176
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.531
What is wrong with these people?

177
00:08:06.638 --> 00:08:07.896
Why are you doing this?

178
00:08:08.036 --> 00:08:09.219
Are you out of your minds?

179
00:08:09.326 --> 00:08:10.724
(His personal trainer, stylist and manager)

180
00:08:10.799 --> 00:08:12.122
What is this?

181
00:08:12.197 --> 00:08:14.165
- What do you think you're doing? - Why?

182
00:08:14.423 --> 00:08:16.283
What are you doing?

183
00:08:16.358 --> 00:08:19.003
Are you out of your minds?

184
00:08:20.293 --> 00:08:21.734
They must be...

185
00:08:22.336 --> 00:08:23.411
out of their minds.

186
00:08:24.239 --> 00:08:25.347
What are you doing?

187
00:08:25.562 --> 00:08:26.637
Are you after me, too?

188
00:08:26.745 --> 00:08:27.820
(Are you after me, too?)

189
00:08:29.002 --> 00:08:30.723
I'm in trouble.

190
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.121
The gym isn't safe.

191
00:08:32.228 --> 00:08:33.303
(Jong Kook is strong and quick-witted.)

192
00:08:35.131 --> 00:08:37.819
(Ji Hyo is lucky and is the ace of the team.)

193
00:08:37.927 --> 00:08:39.647
This is really...

194
00:08:39.862 --> 00:08:42.120
Why do you make me...

195
00:08:42.195 --> 00:08:45.206
doubt everyone so early in the morning?

196
00:08:45.389 --> 00:08:46.464
Why?

197
00:08:46.604 --> 00:08:50.076
I can't let anyone pass me by without suspecting them.

198
00:08:55.345 --> 00:08:56.420
Good morning.

199
00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:57.925
Please, go over there.

200
00:08:58.033 --> 00:08:59.646
You don't need to say hello. Just go over there.

201
00:08:59.753 --> 00:09:01.151
There's no need to say hello. Just go over there.

202
00:09:01.259 --> 00:09:02.764
Hurry. Okay.

203
00:09:02.871 --> 00:09:04.957
I'll find my seat on my own. Just go away.

204
00:09:07.247 --> 00:09:09.000
(The hair salon feels more like a minefield today.)

205
00:09:09.108 --> 00:09:10.183
What is that?

206
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:13.591
(The hair salon feels more like a minefield today.)

207
00:09:13.699 --> 00:09:15.849
(She's surprised.)

208
00:09:18.462 --> 00:09:20.225
(Flinching)

209
00:09:21.333 --> 00:09:24.236
(She sits down on the chair.)

210
00:09:26.171 --> 00:09:29.504
Hello. Hello.

211
00:09:29.934 --> 00:09:32.622
You are getting your hair done early in the morning.

212
00:09:33.665 --> 00:09:35.848
Okay. I am okay.

213
00:09:35.955 --> 00:09:37.643
I already washed my hair.

214
00:09:37.708 --> 00:09:40.149
Don't touch my body! Go away.

215
00:09:41.977 --> 00:09:44.019
You can fix my hair like this, right?

216
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:47.353
No. Go away.

217
00:09:47.675 --> 00:09:48.858
Get away!

218
00:09:49.395 --> 00:09:51.008
No!

219
00:09:51.686 --> 00:09:54.556
No. Just fix my hair like this.

220
00:09:55.309 --> 00:09:56.384
It's all right.

221
00:09:57.212 --> 00:09:59.793
(She starts fixing Ji Hyo's hair.)

222
00:10:00.685 --> 00:10:01.868
What's your mission?

223
00:10:02.298 --> 00:10:05.416
I can't get my name tag ripped until I get to the next destination.

224
00:10:05.491 --> 00:10:07.029
(I can't get my name tag ripped until I reach the next destination.)

225
00:10:07.136 --> 00:10:08.394
Can I rip it then?

226
00:10:08.502 --> 00:10:10.254
Can I rip it then?

227
00:10:10.362 --> 00:10:11.942
(What?)

228
00:10:12.007 --> 00:10:13.695
You want to rip it?

229
00:10:13.985 --> 00:10:15.523
- I will rip it at once. - Do you want to be done with me?

230
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:16.813
(Their friendship is at stake.)

231
00:10:18.501 --> 00:10:19.974
(But her biggest enemy was even nearer.)

232
00:10:20.039 --> 00:10:21.297
By the way,

233
00:10:21.727 --> 00:10:24.662
I fall asleep when someone touches my hair. I'm in trouble.

234
00:10:24.877 --> 00:10:26.382
- Let's make her fall asleep. - I'm in trouble.

235
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:27.780
- Let's make her fall asleep. - Gosh.

236
00:10:28.425 --> 00:10:30.683
I sleep whenever I get my hair done.

237
00:10:32.543 --> 00:10:35.629
But who here would target my name tag?

238
00:10:39.575 --> 00:10:41.253
I am already sleepy.

239
00:10:41.328 --> 00:10:44.661
(Ji Hyo reacts fast and falls asleep fast.)

240
00:10:46.629 --> 00:10:51.005
(Jae Seok has small eyes, but he's very sharp.)

241
00:10:51.112 --> 00:10:52.832
(Startled)

242
00:10:53.155 --> 00:10:54.230
What was that?

243
00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:56.305
Something's not right.

244
00:10:56.381 --> 00:10:57.381
(Who is targeting my name tag?)

245
00:10:57.456 --> 00:10:59.316
Who is targeting my name tag?

246
00:11:01.864 --> 00:11:03.047
Oh gosh!

247
00:11:03.369 --> 00:11:05.412
That surprised me.

248
00:11:06.455 --> 00:11:07.961
Can we take a picture with you?

249
00:11:08.068 --> 00:11:10.283
(Can we take a picture with you?)

250
00:11:10.466 --> 00:11:12.831
- Can we take a picture with you? - Sure.

251
00:11:12.907 --> 00:11:14.229
Go ahead.

252
00:11:14.659 --> 00:11:16.132
Okay.

253
00:11:18.713 --> 00:11:20.465
- Wait. - Wait.

254
00:11:20.573 --> 00:11:21.648
(Flinching)

255
00:11:21.755 --> 00:11:23.228
What's wrong?

256
00:11:24.121 --> 00:11:26.411
Please get closer.

257
00:11:26.916 --> 00:11:28.207
You are too far from her.

258
00:11:28.282 --> 00:11:29.465
(Gosh, stay closer.)

259
00:11:29.572 --> 00:11:30.895
Wait.

260
00:11:31.002 --> 00:11:32.217
This is strange.

261
00:11:32.292 --> 00:11:34.443
Wait. They are a little strange.

262
00:11:34.798 --> 00:11:37.991
- It's... - One, two, three.

263
00:11:38.066 --> 00:11:39.496
(Even if they are suspicious, he takes a picture with them.)

264
00:11:39.604 --> 00:11:41.539
- Thank you. - It's fine.

265
00:11:43.044 --> 00:11:44.335
- One more. - Okay.

266
00:11:44.442 --> 00:11:45.700
- Wait. - Wait.

267
00:11:45.765 --> 00:11:47.560
Why do you hold my hand?

268
00:11:47.636 --> 00:11:49.173
Wait.

269
00:11:49.281 --> 00:11:50.893
- Don't touch my hands. - Stay closer.

270
00:11:50.969 --> 00:11:52.291
Don't touch me.

271
00:11:52.399 --> 00:11:53.581
Okay.

272
00:11:54.549 --> 00:11:56.269
(He stands awkwardly.)

273
00:11:56.345 --> 00:11:57.990
I won't do it.

274
00:11:58.603 --> 00:12:00.248
That's not it.

275
00:12:00.463 --> 00:12:02.688
You keep trying to put your hand behind my back.

276
00:12:02.753 --> 00:12:06.591
(Jae Seok guards himself even from fan girls.)

277
00:12:06.699 --> 00:12:09.817
- Okay. Thank you. Bye. - Thank you.

278
00:12:10.247 --> 00:12:12.075
What are you doing?

279
00:12:12.613 --> 00:12:14.655
- Should I get in? - Yes.

280
00:12:14.763 --> 00:12:16.483
Yes.

281
00:12:16.591 --> 00:12:18.128
(Wait)

282
00:12:18.204 --> 00:12:20.247
(Who said you can leave?)

283
00:12:21.967 --> 00:12:23.902
(Give me your name tag.)

284
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.192
Oh gosh!

285
00:12:25.268 --> 00:12:27.698
(The fan girls return.)

286
00:12:27.773 --> 00:12:29.063
Excuse me!

287
00:12:29.171 --> 00:12:30.246
I knew it!

288
00:12:30.353 --> 00:12:32.289
I thought you were strange.

289
00:12:32.719 --> 00:12:35.514
What are you doing?

290
00:12:35.837 --> 00:12:39.170
I thought you were acting strange.

291
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.030
- Wait. - What?

292
00:12:41.105 --> 00:12:43.363
- There's a problem with the audio. - What?

293
00:12:43.761 --> 00:12:44.901
What problem does it have?

294
00:12:44.976 --> 00:12:47.019
- There's a problem. - What problem?

295
00:12:47.127 --> 00:12:49.245
- The audio isn't working. - Why isn't it working?

296
00:12:49.922 --> 00:12:51.105
(Did the mic fall when I was running?)

297
00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:52.320
Why doesn't it work?

298
00:12:54.868 --> 00:12:56.911
(He grabs Jae Seok's name tag.)

299
00:12:57.954 --> 00:13:03.792
(Will he let it get ripped?)

300
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.513
Hey!

301
00:13:06.265 --> 00:13:07.771
Hey!

302
00:13:07.878 --> 00:13:09.351
(He got his name tag ripped!)

303
00:13:09.416 --> 00:13:13.362
(The audio crew removes his name tag.)

304
00:13:13.577 --> 00:13:16.082
(Jae Seok is out for the first time.)

305
00:13:16.157 --> 00:13:17.770
Hey!

306
00:13:18.308 --> 00:13:20.211
How can this happen?

307
00:13:20.275 --> 00:13:21.426
You are out once.

308
00:13:22.608 --> 00:13:25.619
How can he be allowed to do this? This is crazy.

309
00:13:25.834 --> 00:13:29.597
So we don't know who it's going to be. The girls were acting strange.

310
00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.210
Gosh.

311
00:13:31.317 --> 00:13:34.866
I've never seen people like them in my neighbourhood.

312
00:13:34.973 --> 00:13:36.694
(Even after getting it ripped off, he doesn't stop talking.)

313
00:13:36.801 --> 00:13:38.306
Gosh.

314
00:13:41.424 --> 00:13:42.607
It's cold.

315
00:13:42.682 --> 00:13:44.327
(Gary is on his way to meet his manager.)

316
00:13:45.188 --> 00:13:46.403
- Hello. - Hello.

317
00:13:46.478 --> 00:13:47.876
(He meets strange fans too.)

318
00:13:47.983 --> 00:13:49.811
- Wait. - No. No.

319
00:13:50.564 --> 00:13:52.176
- Please take a picture with us. - No. No.

320
00:13:52.284 --> 00:13:53.789
I don't take pictures.

321
00:13:53.897 --> 00:13:56.262
- Please take one picture with us. - No. No pictures.

322
00:13:56.477 --> 00:13:57.950
- Why not? - No.

323
00:13:58.015 --> 00:13:59.305
I don't want to!

324
00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.068
I can't take a picture.

325
00:14:01.133 --> 00:14:03.498
- Please take a picture with me. - I look too ugly today.

326
00:14:03.574 --> 00:14:05.186
But I look pretty today.

327
00:14:05.262 --> 00:14:06.692
Then I will take a picture of you.

328
00:14:06.799 --> 00:14:07.874
(His fans don't give up.)

329
00:14:07.982 --> 00:14:09.562
- Gosh. - It looks nice!

330
00:14:09.627 --> 00:14:10.853
No!

331
00:14:10.917 --> 00:14:12.100
(The girl tries to grab it.)

332
00:14:12.175 --> 00:14:15.003
No!

333
00:14:15.218 --> 00:14:16.584
You were so close!

334
00:14:17.196 --> 00:14:18.841
- Come inside the picture. - You didn't take it.

335
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:20.884
In 1, 2, 3.

336
00:14:20.992 --> 00:14:22.680
(Gary is very quick and sharp.)

337
00:14:22.744 --> 00:14:24.970
Okay. Okay.

338
00:14:25.185 --> 00:14:26.873
- Cheers! - Cheers!

339
00:14:26.938 --> 00:14:28.056
Cheers!

340
00:14:28.626 --> 00:14:30.561
She reached out for my name tag so quickly.

341
00:14:31.744 --> 00:14:34.647
(Gary finally meets his manager after the intense fan meeting.)

342
00:14:34.755 --> 00:14:36.690
- You should get on from this side. - I will ride in the back?

343
00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:40.915
(He reaches out for the name tag.)

344
00:14:41.098 --> 00:14:42.926
(He grabs it.)

345
00:14:43.001 --> 00:14:44.249
What are you doing?

346
00:14:44.324 --> 00:14:47.367
(What's wrong with him?)

347
00:14:48.549 --> 00:14:49.700
Goodness.

348
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.463
It's a good start.

349
00:14:52.786 --> 00:14:54.216
So this is how it goes.

350
00:14:54.323 --> 00:14:55.581
(Kwang Soo is surprisingly doing well.)

351
00:14:57.549 --> 00:14:59.516
We don't know how many times we will be attacked, right?

352
00:14:59.592 --> 00:15:01.742
- I'll change your mic battery. - Hold on.

353
00:15:01.957 --> 00:15:03.032
Hold on.

354
00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:04.753
- I can't hear your voice. - What?

355
00:15:05.581 --> 00:15:07.408
- The mic... - I will give it to you.

356
00:15:08.301 --> 00:15:10.129
- The mic... - I...

357
00:15:10.236 --> 00:15:13.354
(He looks around.)

358
00:15:13.462 --> 00:15:15.182
I will borrow this for a second.

359
00:15:15.257 --> 00:15:17.225
You know what this is, right?

360
00:15:19.053 --> 00:15:20.128
(He's surrounded by enemies.)

361
00:15:20.236 --> 00:15:21.418
No one is on my side.

362
00:15:21.494 --> 00:15:22.891
It's okay. Here.

363
00:15:23.816 --> 00:15:28.515
(I think today will be a very tough day.)

364
00:15:29.407 --> 00:15:33.643
It's my first time here, so I don't know who works here.

365
00:15:33.708 --> 00:15:36.579
(He is not acquainted with the workers at the salon.)

366
00:15:36.654 --> 00:15:38.299
- Do you need anything? - What?

367
00:15:38.589 --> 00:15:39.772
Do you need anything?

368
00:15:40.557 --> 00:15:41.707
- Do I need anything? - You want something to drink?

369
00:15:41.815 --> 00:15:43.428
- What? - Anything to drink?

370
00:15:43.998 --> 00:15:46.331
They all work here, right?

371
00:15:46.395 --> 00:15:48.083
They all work here, right?

372
00:15:48.653 --> 00:15:51.126
(Of course.)

373
00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:52.707
I am sorry. It's just that it's my first time here.

374
00:15:53.857 --> 00:15:57.438
(But what is up with this chilly atmosphere?)

375
00:15:57.868 --> 00:15:59.405
Who works here?

376
00:16:03.459 --> 00:16:06.007
(He's scared.)

377
00:16:07.114 --> 00:16:12.921
(The girl stares at Kwang Soo.)

378
00:16:13.028 --> 00:16:14.394
Do you need anything?

379
00:16:14.501 --> 00:16:17.791
(Do you need anything?)

380
00:16:17.867 --> 00:16:19.834
Please don't do that. It frightens me.

381
00:16:20.802 --> 00:16:22.490
You're scaring me.

382
00:16:22.597 --> 00:16:25.038
(But I need something from you.)

383
00:16:25.931 --> 00:16:29.446
(He got his hair done in the hair-raising environment.)

384
00:16:30.414 --> 00:16:31.952
No. It's okay.

385
00:16:32.167 --> 00:16:35.285
- I'll help you take it out. - This is how I wear my clothes.

386
00:16:35.392 --> 00:16:36.543
(No, I always wear my clothes like this.)

387
00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:38.510
No, I'll do it myself.

388
00:16:39.371 --> 00:16:40.446
No, I am okay.

389
00:16:40.768 --> 00:16:41.844
Please.

390
00:16:42.026 --> 00:16:43.639
You look so terrifying.

391
00:16:43.747 --> 00:16:45.284
(Please, leave me alone.)

392
00:16:45.392 --> 00:16:47.112
I will do it. What's going on?

393
00:16:47.617 --> 00:16:49.800
What's going on? Wait.

394
00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.381
Please, just leave me alone.

395
00:16:52.596 --> 00:16:53.778
Please.

396
00:16:55.284 --> 00:16:56.466
(He gets up.)

397
00:16:57.864 --> 00:16:59.154
What? Okay.

398
00:16:59.337 --> 00:17:00.767
(Flinching)

399
00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:03.240
Please give up now.

400
00:17:03.745 --> 00:17:04.960
Give up already.

401
00:17:07.036 --> 00:17:08.154
(He moves fast.)

402
00:17:08.218 --> 00:17:10.304
I am sorry. I'm sorry.

403
00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:12.734
(He's about to escape.)

404
00:17:12.809 --> 00:17:14.175
Give up already.

405
00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:16.680
I'll get going. Thank you.

406
00:17:16.755 --> 00:17:18.078
Bye.

407
00:17:18.185 --> 00:17:19.368
(He manages to escape the hair salon.)

408
00:17:20.551 --> 00:17:24.422
(However, Haha is still suspecting the couple.)

409
00:17:27.002 --> 00:17:28.507
(He stares at them.)

410
00:17:30.228 --> 00:17:31.518
How long have you been dating your boyfriend?

411
00:17:31.625 --> 00:17:33.056
(He starts interrogating her.)

412
00:17:33.131 --> 00:17:36.066
(He takes a seat and starts questioning her.)

413
00:17:36.141 --> 00:17:37.507
How long have you been dating your boyfriend?

414
00:17:37.754 --> 00:17:40.012
- I have a boyfriend. - So how long have you been dating?

415
00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.732
- Three years. - Three years?

416
00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.528
(He asked her how long they've been dating.)

417
00:17:43.593 --> 00:17:44.668
Where did you meet him?

418
00:17:44.743 --> 00:17:46.678
At school.

419
00:17:46.754 --> 00:17:49.012
When is your boyfriend's birthday?

420
00:17:49.474 --> 00:17:51.302
- April 15th. - April 15th.

421
00:17:51.409 --> 00:17:53.990
(He is very suspicious of them.)

422
00:17:54.452 --> 00:17:55.603
Thank you. I am sorry.

423
00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:59.011
(Someone touches Haha's name tag...)

424
00:18:00.441 --> 00:18:01.516
(and rips it.)

425
00:18:02.376 --> 00:18:05.355
(When he was suspecting the couple,)

426
00:18:05.494 --> 00:18:07.860
(one of the crew memebers ripped his name tag.)

427
00:18:08.075 --> 00:18:10.440
(How can this happen?)

428
00:18:10.731 --> 00:18:11.806
What was that?

429
00:18:12.268 --> 00:18:15.064
(He rips his name tag and leaves.)

430
00:18:17.429 --> 00:18:20.838
(The suspicious Haha is out for the first time.)

431
00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:23.590
This is crazy.

432
00:18:23.665 --> 00:18:26.751
When you live in the world where you can trust no one,

433
00:18:26.816 --> 00:18:29.579
your heart really shrinks.

434
00:18:29.686 --> 00:18:30.762
(He doesn't stop talking.)

435
00:18:30.977 --> 00:18:32.482
(Someone approaches him.)

436
00:18:33.095 --> 00:18:34.170
Hey!

437
00:18:34.278 --> 00:18:35.815
Hey!

438
00:18:35.923 --> 00:18:37.535
(He's shocked.)

439
00:18:38.073 --> 00:18:39.148
Hey!

440
00:18:39.256 --> 00:18:40.729
Yoo Seok.

441
00:18:40.869 --> 00:18:42.019
You can't do this to me.

442
00:18:42.987 --> 00:18:44.202
No way.

443
00:18:44.815 --> 00:18:47.642
Hey! Hey! No way.

444
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:48.825
(I'm sorry, Seok Jin.)

445
00:18:49.255 --> 00:18:50.330
Are you really...

446
00:18:50.653 --> 00:18:51.836
Are you really...

447
00:18:53.233 --> 00:18:54.739
Hey!

448
00:18:54.846 --> 00:18:56.136
(The cameraman attacks him.)

449
00:18:56.244 --> 00:18:57.319
Yoo Seok,

450
00:18:57.502 --> 00:18:58.717
you can't do this to me!

451
00:18:59.255 --> 00:19:00.330
Hey!

452
00:19:00.437 --> 00:19:01.620
(He rips the name tag.)

453
00:19:02.695 --> 00:19:04.308
(Seok Jin is out for the first time.)

454
00:19:04.416 --> 00:19:06.501
This is impossible. What is wrong with you?

455
00:19:09.577 --> 00:19:10.899
Gosh!

456
00:19:10.974 --> 00:19:13.049
Hey, how can you...

457
00:19:13.555 --> 00:19:15.200
How can you be so cold-hearted?

458
00:19:15.813 --> 00:19:19.253
I never thought you would do this to me.

459
00:19:19.576 --> 00:19:21.834
No one can be trusted.

460
00:19:22.726 --> 00:19:23.801
Are you sure you are working for our company?

461
00:19:23.877 --> 00:19:25.457
(He takes it out on his manager.)

462
00:19:27.317 --> 00:19:29.177
- Please get in the car. - You get in first.

463
00:19:29.253 --> 00:19:30.651
(I can't trust anybody.)

464
00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:34.554
(Meanwhile, Jae Seok is moving to the next destination.)

465
00:19:34.629 --> 00:19:35.779
Gosh.

466
00:19:37.639 --> 00:19:39.360
(Sneaky)

467
00:19:39.467 --> 00:19:41.048
Hey! What are you doing?

468
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:43.768
What are you doing right now?

469
00:19:43.876 --> 00:19:44.843
(Looking for every chance)

470
00:19:44.951 --> 00:19:46.209
Gosh...

471
00:19:46.284 --> 00:19:47.897
(Looking for every chance)

472
00:19:47.961 --> 00:19:49.359
Are you allowed to do this?

473
00:19:49.606 --> 00:19:52.047
Can you sit next to me and just rip my name tag?

474
00:19:53.122 --> 00:19:54.413
By the way, where are we going?

475
00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:55.961
(Where are they headed?)

476
00:19:56.025 --> 00:19:57.316
We should get some coffee.

477
00:19:57.423 --> 00:19:58.498
(Let's get some coffee.)

478
00:19:58.574 --> 00:19:59.681
Coffee?

479
00:19:59.756 --> 00:20:00.799
(Coffee?)

480
00:20:00.896 --> 00:20:04.702
Why do you want coffee all of a sudden?

481
00:20:05.992 --> 00:20:09.401
I won't let it slide. What do you mean, "Check the audio"?

482
00:20:09.465 --> 00:20:12.261
Do you want to get checked by me?

483
00:20:13.014 --> 00:20:14.304
Oh my goodness.

484
00:20:15.164 --> 00:20:16.239
Is that a new store?

485
00:20:16.992 --> 00:20:18.927
Come on.

486
00:20:19.357 --> 00:20:20.647
(That was close.)

487
00:20:22.798 --> 00:20:26.776
(They finally arrive at a cafe.)

488
00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:28.066
Where do I need to go?

489
00:20:28.174 --> 00:20:29.357
- That way. - Let go.

490
00:20:30.539 --> 00:20:33.260
Let go. I almost hit you with my elbow.

491
00:20:35.378 --> 00:20:36.421
- Is it here? - Yes.

492
00:20:37.743 --> 00:20:38.818
Oh, come on.

493
00:20:39.861 --> 00:20:41.076
Don't touch my back.

494
00:20:41.184 --> 00:20:42.582
(I was just showing you the way.)

495
00:20:43.517 --> 00:20:44.732
Is this it?

496
00:20:48.065 --> 00:20:51.334
(Jae Seok arrives at the second destination.)

497
00:20:51.398 --> 00:20:53.119
- Are you going to be like that? - Don't worry.

498
00:20:55.774 --> 00:20:57.097
- Hello. - Hello.

499
00:20:57.527 --> 00:20:58.892
- Hello. - Hello.

500
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.623
You don't look like regular customers.

501
00:21:04.731 --> 00:21:06.806
There's something about you.

502
00:21:06.881 --> 00:21:08.064
I can tell by your looks.

503
00:21:09.354 --> 00:21:10.429
(The cameraman touches Jae Seok's back.)

504
00:21:10.505 --> 00:21:12.150
Wait. Hey.

505
00:21:12.763 --> 00:21:14.945
(Startled)

506
00:21:15.021 --> 00:21:16.558
Stop it.

507
00:21:16.666 --> 00:21:17.816
You'll pay for this.

508
00:21:17.924 --> 00:21:19.214
(There are enemies everywhere.)

509
00:21:20.289 --> 00:21:21.440
(Turning)

510
00:21:21.536 --> 00:21:22.687
(Jae Seok is startled.)

511
00:21:24.192 --> 00:21:25.773
- What is it? - Can we take a picture?

512
00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:28.095
- Can we take a picture? - A picture?

513
00:21:28.385 --> 00:21:30.041
Taking a picture is no problem.

514
00:21:30.966 --> 00:21:32.224
I'll take the picture.

515
00:21:32.331 --> 00:21:33.869
(I'll take it.)

516
00:21:38.783 --> 00:21:41.825
(A girl creeps up.)

517
00:21:47.524 --> 00:21:49.029
Wasn't someone just here?

518
00:21:49.674 --> 00:21:50.857
Right?

519
00:21:51.502 --> 00:21:52.620
Didn't someone just get close?

520
00:21:52.717 --> 00:21:54.405
(Someone was near me.)

521
00:21:54.513 --> 00:21:55.588
Am I wrong?

522
00:21:55.663 --> 00:21:56.738
(Maybe I'm wrong.)

523
00:21:59.244 --> 00:22:02.222
(Another lady stands up.)

524
00:22:02.469 --> 00:22:03.544
You scared me!

525
00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:06.200
You scared me!

526
00:22:06.308 --> 00:22:08.243
(A girl grabs his name tag.)

527
00:22:08.351 --> 00:22:09.426
Gosh!

528
00:22:09.533 --> 00:22:10.641
(She rips it off.)

529
00:22:10.899 --> 00:22:12.469
Wait a minute.

530
00:22:13.221 --> 00:22:14.942
(That was...)

531
00:22:15.049 --> 00:22:18.458
(perfect teamwork.)

532
00:22:18.673 --> 00:22:20.070
(Jae Seok's out for the second time.)

533
00:22:20.178 --> 00:22:21.285
Is that valid?

534
00:22:21.715 --> 00:22:23.758
This isn't fair.

535
00:22:24.188 --> 00:22:27.737
Who are you? Why did you rip off my tag?

536
00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:33.220
(After getting her makeup and and hair done,)

537
00:22:33.295 --> 00:22:37.779
(Ji Hyo leaves the hair salon in suspicion.)

538
00:22:38.166 --> 00:22:40.101
Please, do something about her.

539
00:22:40.209 --> 00:22:41.607
(Please, do something about her.)

540
00:22:42.682 --> 00:22:43.865
Watch the car.

541
00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:45.585
Let's go.

542
00:22:46.477 --> 00:22:48.348
You should protect me.

543
00:22:49.241 --> 00:22:50.563
Trust me. I'm not...

544
00:22:50.681 --> 00:22:52.832
- the bad guy. - Okay. All right.

545
00:22:52.929 --> 00:22:54.187
You go first.

546
00:22:55.154 --> 00:22:56.735
Manager.

547
00:22:57.197 --> 00:22:58.272
Come this way.

548
00:22:58.380 --> 00:22:59.638
(Manager, come this way.)

549
00:23:01.175 --> 00:23:02.358
- Hello. - Hello.

550
00:23:02.433 --> 00:23:03.971
(Hello)

551
00:23:04.691 --> 00:23:08.057
(Ji Hyo's afraid someone might rip her name tag off.)

552
00:23:09.057 --> 00:23:10.132
I'm embarrassed.

553
00:23:10.712 --> 00:23:12.110
Why do I have to be...

554
00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:16.443
suspicious of an innocent passerby?

555
00:23:17.626 --> 00:23:18.669
Manager!

556
00:23:18.776 --> 00:23:21.787
(Manager, please come quickly.)

557
00:23:22.249 --> 00:23:24.045
Come here quickly. Now.

558
00:23:24.152 --> 00:23:25.292
- Hey. - Yes!

559
00:23:25.765 --> 00:23:30.636
(Ji Hyo is out for the first time.)

560
00:23:31.174 --> 00:23:33.862
I knew you were going to do that.

561
00:23:33.969 --> 00:23:35.904
I knew you would do that.

562
00:23:36.442 --> 00:23:38.485
I shouldn't have trusted you.

563
00:23:41.205 --> 00:23:44.184
(Ji Hyo may get violent under pressure.)

564
00:23:44.259 --> 00:23:46.872
- Yes! - Oh my gosh.

565
00:23:46.979 --> 00:23:48.054
Hey.

566
00:23:49.022 --> 00:23:50.957
Wait.

567
00:23:51.065 --> 00:23:53.323
Why are you doing this?

568
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:54.398
(He grabs the name tag.)

569
00:23:54.505 --> 00:23:56.516
Why are you doing this?

570
00:23:56.978 --> 00:23:59.021
Come on, guys.

571
00:23:59.129 --> 00:24:00.204
Come on.

572
00:24:00.709 --> 00:24:02.139
What's wrong with you?

573
00:24:02.247 --> 00:24:03.784
Why are you doing this?

574
00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:06.225
Come on.

575
00:24:06.333 --> 00:24:07.838
(Jong Kook is out for the first time.)

576
00:24:07.946 --> 00:24:09.236
Oh gosh.

577
00:24:11.171 --> 00:24:14.289
Everyone here is after my name tag.

578
00:24:14.902 --> 00:24:17.375
I have to work out, but I can't.

579
00:24:17.483 --> 00:24:19.558
What do you want me to do?

580
00:24:20.203 --> 00:24:23.536
He's my actual personal trainer.

581
00:24:23.644 --> 00:24:25.794
(Someone as muscular as he must rip his name tag off.)

582
00:24:25.901 --> 00:24:27.482
Oh gosh.

583
00:24:28.482 --> 00:24:33.858
(The first attack in Agility Test is over.)

584
00:24:34.718 --> 00:24:37.266
(Meanwhile at the cafe)

585
00:24:39.664 --> 00:24:41.030
I can't even trust the cameraman.

586
00:24:43.427 --> 00:24:44.933
- Hi, Gary. - Hi.

587
00:24:45.717 --> 00:24:47.621
Come here. Did they get your name tag?

588
00:24:47.728 --> 00:24:48.803
Theses people...

589
00:24:49.448 --> 00:24:50.814
No, not yet.

590
00:24:50.954 --> 00:24:52.136
- Really? - Hello.

591
00:24:53.104 --> 00:24:54.502
Come here quickly.

592
00:24:54.609 --> 00:24:56.760
(Gary takes a seat.)

593
00:24:56.867 --> 00:24:58.050
Oh gosh.

594
00:24:58.878 --> 00:25:01.673
(Oh gosh.)

595
00:25:01.813 --> 00:25:03.103
What are you doing?

596
00:25:03.211 --> 00:25:04.684
Oh my goodness.

597
00:25:04.792 --> 00:25:06.867
- Let's not do this to each other. - Okay.

598
00:25:06.974 --> 00:25:08.157
(I should've ripped it off.)

599
00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:10.845
Can we take a picture?

600
00:25:10.952 --> 00:25:12.673
I don't usually take pictures.

601
00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:15.468
I only take it when I look handsome.

602
00:25:15.576 --> 00:25:17.802
- You're handsome. - Today, my face is puffy.

603
00:25:18.156 --> 00:25:19.769
- That's funny. - Oh gosh.

604
00:25:20.522 --> 00:25:22.242
Even my manager tried to get me.

605
00:25:22.317 --> 00:25:23.855
- Really? - Yes.

606
00:25:23.962 --> 00:25:25.500
He tried to rip my name tag.

607
00:25:25.575 --> 00:25:27.188
- That's too much. - Gosh.

608
00:25:27.296 --> 00:25:28.478
- He almost got me. - Goodness.

609
00:25:28.984 --> 00:25:30.736
(People are watching them.)

610
00:25:30.811 --> 00:25:32.241
Gary, we need to check your audio.

611
00:25:33.639 --> 00:25:34.682
That scared me.

612
00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:39.660
(Gary doesn't think twice. He just turns his back.)

613
00:25:39.983 --> 00:25:41.779
What?

614
00:25:41.843 --> 00:25:44.069
(Gary's tag gets ripped off.)

615
00:25:44.682 --> 00:25:45.789
Come on.

616
00:25:45.864 --> 00:25:48.262
(Gary is upset.)

617
00:25:48.337 --> 00:25:49.445
That's really mean.

618
00:25:49.552 --> 00:25:51.563
- Gosh. - I can't believe it.

619
00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:54.100
- This is too much. - Wow.

620
00:25:54.176 --> 00:25:55.788
(Gary blames others for his carelessness.)

621
00:25:56.896 --> 00:25:59.014
(Seok Jin arrives at the cafe.)

622
00:26:00.089 --> 00:26:02.562
Even the bodyguards are scary today.

623
00:26:03.745 --> 00:26:04.788
(He rushes to get inside.)

624
00:26:04.895 --> 00:26:06.433
What's going on?

625
00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:08.336
I can't feel anything.

626
00:26:08.508 --> 00:26:09.626
You're here.

627
00:26:09.766 --> 00:26:11.271
- Hi. - Hi, Gary.

628
00:26:11.379 --> 00:26:12.562
(Seok Jin is very defensive.)

629
00:26:13.174 --> 00:26:14.820
- Come here. - Be careful.

630
00:26:14.927 --> 00:26:17.077
(Here comes...)

631
00:26:17.153 --> 00:26:19.873
(the prey.)

632
00:26:20.841 --> 00:26:22.238
One Americano and...

633
00:26:22.314 --> 00:26:23.668
Do you have any snacks?

634
00:26:24.744 --> 00:26:25.894
(He's very defensive.)

635
00:26:26.002 --> 00:26:27.077
Can you make it quickly?

636
00:26:27.184 --> 00:26:29.442
(Gary and Jae Seok...)

637
00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:31.378
(are playing perfect defence.)

638
00:26:31.485 --> 00:26:32.668
What are you doing?

639
00:26:34.679 --> 00:26:36.076
(Seok Jin...)

640
00:26:36.184 --> 00:26:38.657
(showed his back.)

641
00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.162
These people...

642
00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:42.667
(Gary rips the tag.)

643
00:26:42.775 --> 00:26:45.968
(Oh gosh!)

644
00:26:46.538 --> 00:26:49.549
(They are brutal.)

645
00:26:49.656 --> 00:26:52.237
Once you have your drinks, you can move to the next place.

646
00:26:52.344 --> 00:26:53.710
- Really? - I have to get my drink.

647
00:26:53.957 --> 00:26:56.430
Why don't you attack Seok Jin? Just do it.

648
00:26:56.613 --> 00:26:59.043
Is that mine?

649
00:26:59.441 --> 00:27:01.268
(She reaches for the tag.)

650
00:27:01.591 --> 00:27:03.096
(Gary rips it.)

651
00:27:03.741 --> 00:27:05.107
(That was good...)

652
00:27:05.214 --> 00:27:07.505
(teamwork.)

653
00:27:07.935 --> 00:27:09.472
(This is the second time already.)

654
00:27:09.547 --> 00:27:10.870
- Thank you. - Here.

655
00:27:10.977 --> 00:27:14.386
- Here's your name tag you ordered. - Come on.

656
00:27:14.493 --> 00:27:16.429
I can't remember how many times I got ripped.

657
00:27:16.859 --> 00:27:17.934
(They all have their drinks.)

658
00:27:18.042 --> 00:27:19.117
I'm so hungry.

659
00:27:19.869 --> 00:27:22.342
- Seok Jin, let me check your audio. - My audio?

660
00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:23.525
I need to check the battery.

661
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.600
(Of course.)

662
00:27:25.675 --> 00:27:27.794
(The audio needs to be checked indeed.)

663
00:27:28.439 --> 00:27:31.374
(Audio director is here.)

664
00:27:31.482 --> 00:27:32.987
(He rips the tag off.)

665
00:27:33.094 --> 00:27:35.245
(What?)

666
00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:38.685
(Seok Jin needs to do better than this.)

667
00:27:39.331 --> 00:27:43.524
(Seok Jin is destined to be the race starter.)

668
00:27:45.137 --> 00:27:46.212
I will...

669
00:27:46.642 --> 00:27:47.717
get going.

670
00:27:48.222 --> 00:27:49.835
- I'll see you later. - See you later.

671
00:27:49.943 --> 00:27:51.480
Always watch your back.

672
00:27:51.556 --> 00:27:52.663
(Always watch your back.)

673
00:27:53.631 --> 00:27:55.136
(Will Jae Seok escape first?)

674
00:27:55.244 --> 00:27:57.071
(Seok Jin rips the tag off.)

675
00:27:58.039 --> 00:28:00.114
(Did he just get my tag?)

676
00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:02.662
I was just saying farewell.

677
00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:04.383
- Come on. - That's brutal.

678
00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:06.824
(Jae Seok is very agile but is easily distracted and careless.)

679
00:28:06.963 --> 00:28:07.963
That's really bad.

680
00:28:09.759 --> 00:28:12.984
(Ji Hyo's sleeping.)

681
00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:17.930
(Someone's hand touches her.)

682
00:28:18.038 --> 00:28:20.833
(She wakes up.)

683
00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.338
(How dare you?)

684
00:28:33.306 --> 00:28:34.349
(Ji Hyo is angry.)

685
00:28:34.456 --> 00:28:35.564
Don't rip my tag.

686
00:28:37.607 --> 00:28:39.080
(At the cafe)

687
00:28:39.187 --> 00:28:40.800
Can we take a picture?

688
00:28:40.907 --> 00:28:43.090
- Can we take a picture? - Okay. Give me your phone.

689
00:28:44.563 --> 00:28:46.961
(He crouches down.)

690
00:28:47.068 --> 00:28:49.971
(What is he doing?)

691
00:28:50.079 --> 00:28:51.369
Come over here.

692
00:28:51.799 --> 00:28:53.735
No, this way.

693
00:28:54.702 --> 00:28:56.347
Lie down.

694
00:28:56.638 --> 00:28:58.035
I'm sorry.

695
00:28:58.681 --> 00:28:59.756
(This is weird.)

696
00:28:59.863 --> 00:29:01.831
- I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. - Okay.

697
00:29:02.121 --> 00:29:03.196
In 1, 2, 3.

698
00:29:03.304 --> 00:29:04.487
(They seem friendly.)

699
00:29:05.057 --> 00:29:06.315
- Here you go. - Thank you.

700
00:29:06.422 --> 00:29:07.497
- Can I take one? - Yes.

701
00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.433
Wait a minute.

702
00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:10.830
I'm sorry.

703
00:29:11.368 --> 00:29:12.551
In 1, 2, 3.

704
00:29:12.626 --> 00:29:13.733
(Everyone lies down next to Kwang Soo.)

705
00:29:13.948 --> 00:29:15.131
Okay. Thank you.

706
00:29:16.852 --> 00:29:19.755
(People line up to lie down and get a picture.)

707
00:29:19.862 --> 00:29:20.970
In 1, 2, 3.

708
00:29:21.077 --> 00:29:22.658
(This is how Kwang Soo survives.)

709
00:29:23.916 --> 00:29:27.464
(Jae Seok is on his way to the next place.)

710
00:29:28.034 --> 00:29:29.754
Is it over when I reach the waiting room?

711
00:29:29.829 --> 00:29:31.044
You're safe in the waiting room.

712
00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:32.872
Will it be over then?

713
00:29:33.302 --> 00:29:34.302
Do I get off here?

714
00:29:34.377 --> 00:29:37.495
(He's the first one to arrive.)

715
00:29:38.571 --> 00:29:40.829
(He's very alert.)

716
00:29:42.011 --> 00:29:43.302
(Suddenly)

717
00:29:44.775 --> 00:29:46.387
You don't need to check my microphone.

718
00:29:46.495 --> 00:29:47.710
Come on.

719
00:29:47.817 --> 00:29:49.215
(Oh no!)

720
00:29:49.323 --> 00:29:51.796
Come on.

721
00:29:53.731 --> 00:29:56.204
What are you doing?

722
00:29:57.064 --> 00:29:58.677
You can't do this.

723
00:29:58.784 --> 00:30:00.935
(He can't let his guard down until he is in the waiting room.)

724
00:30:01.042 --> 00:30:02.472
I can't believe this.

725
00:30:02.548 --> 00:30:03.698
(He can't let his guard down until he is in the waiting room.)

726
00:30:03.806 --> 00:30:04.913
Is this the waiting room?

727
00:30:06.128 --> 00:30:08.461
I can't believe this.

728
00:30:08.569 --> 00:30:10.934
You can't do this to me.

729
00:30:11.655 --> 00:30:12.730
(Let me check your mic.)

730
00:30:12.794 --> 00:30:14.407
My mic? What a joke.

731
00:30:14.482 --> 00:30:15.482
(My mic? What a joke.)

732
00:30:15.558 --> 00:30:17.095
My mic is fine.

733
00:30:17.385 --> 00:30:18.536
Just one person then.

734
00:30:18.643 --> 00:30:20.471
(He's defensive.)

735
00:30:21.288 --> 00:30:22.407
Okay.

736
00:30:23.374 --> 00:30:26.708
I can't trust anyone.

737
00:30:29.643 --> 00:30:31.471
(Oh no!)

738
00:30:31.578 --> 00:30:33.008
(It's Kwang Soo.)

739
00:30:33.083 --> 00:30:35.234
Ji Hyo! You're here.

740
00:30:35.341 --> 00:30:38.965
You. You!

741
00:30:39.072 --> 00:30:40.825
Do you know where it is?

742
00:30:41.147 --> 00:30:44.158
That's why I'm not ripping name tags, we're all getting them ripped.

743
00:30:44.266 --> 00:30:45.341
(Moving swiftly)

744
00:30:47.276 --> 00:30:48.642
Okay, thank you.

745
00:30:49.824 --> 00:30:50.964
Thank you.

746
00:30:51.039 --> 00:30:52.115
(Awkward)

747
00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:54.480
(He only touched Haha slightly...)

748
00:30:54.588 --> 00:30:57.243
(and Haha gets startled...)

749
00:30:57.706 --> 00:30:58.996
(and almost fainted.)

750
00:30:59.501 --> 00:31:00.748
(He's strange.)

751
00:31:01.791 --> 00:31:02.899
(Sneaking near Haha)

752
00:31:03.049 --> 00:31:04.479
Stop cleaning.

753
00:31:05.092 --> 00:31:07.135
Why are you cleaning so hard?

754
00:31:08.167 --> 00:31:09.565
Okay, then I'll go over there.

755
00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:10.931
(I'll go over there.)

756
00:31:11.974 --> 00:31:14.049
(Moving quickly)

757
00:31:14.124 --> 00:31:15.629
(Rushing away)

758
00:31:15.737 --> 00:31:16.844
What is it?

759
00:31:17.059 --> 00:31:18.242
What do you want?

760
00:31:18.747 --> 00:31:20.177
Why are you cleaning around here?

761
00:31:20.392 --> 00:31:22.865
The look in your eyes isn't for cleaning.

762
00:31:22.941 --> 00:31:26.199
(Haha has good reaction and catches on quickly.)

763
00:31:28.241 --> 00:31:30.682
(Let me check your mic.)

764
00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:32.220
The batteries are already checked.

765
00:31:32.327 --> 00:31:35.338
(What's this? This is too easy.)

766
00:31:35.445 --> 00:31:36.445
I've been checked already.

767
00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.886
(Ripping)

768
00:31:39.208 --> 00:31:40.574
I can't believe...

769
00:31:42.327 --> 00:31:45.122
I really can't trust anyone.

770
00:31:46.627 --> 00:31:48.778
(As soon as they arrive,)

771
00:31:48.885 --> 00:31:50.606
(they are all on their guards.)

772
00:31:50.713 --> 00:31:53.046
I really don't trust anyone. No, stop.

773
00:31:53.154 --> 00:31:54.294
No, no.

774
00:31:54.369 --> 00:31:55.584
(No, no)

775
00:31:56.057 --> 00:31:57.734
No. Why? What do you want?

776
00:31:57.810 --> 00:31:59.605
(Your mic...)

777
00:32:00.282 --> 00:32:02.648
Okay, you don't have to come here. Cars are coming. I got it.

778
00:32:02.755 --> 00:32:05.551
If you come near me, I will hit you.

779
00:32:05.841 --> 00:32:07.701
You'll get hit... Wait, I'm dizzy.

780
00:32:07.809 --> 00:32:08.884
I lost my balance.

781
00:32:08.959 --> 00:32:11.540
(Ji Hyo's shouting stands out more than her ability to react.)

782
00:32:15.443 --> 00:32:16.841
(He's on guard.)

783
00:32:17.808 --> 00:32:19.636
(Let me check your mic.)

784
00:32:19.711 --> 00:32:22.937
(Kwang Soo is extremely tense.)

785
00:32:24.152 --> 00:32:25.980
(He sticks his back to the car.)

786
00:32:27.238 --> 00:32:30.173
(Kwang Soo passes the audio staff and heads for the waiting room.)

787
00:32:30.281 --> 00:32:31.356
Hey.

788
00:32:31.969 --> 00:32:33.936
(You surprised me.)

789
00:32:34.119 --> 00:32:36.517
(Kwang Soo senses something strange.)

790
00:32:36.624 --> 00:32:39.667
(The security manager suddenly attacks in front of the room.)

791
00:32:39.818 --> 00:32:42.108
- Hey, just give up. - Jae Seok!

792
00:32:42.538 --> 00:32:44.151
(Jae Seok slowly slides towards Kwang Soo.)

793
00:32:44.258 --> 00:32:46.301
Jae Seok, what are you doing?

794
00:32:46.516 --> 00:32:48.344
Why are you doing this?

795
00:32:50.247 --> 00:32:51.537
You are ripped once more.

796
00:32:51.677 --> 00:32:52.967
All right, it's done.

797
00:32:53.075 --> 00:32:54.440
- Jae Seok. - This is how you get stronger.

798
00:32:54.505 --> 00:32:55.978
Are we going to be like this with each other?

799
00:32:56.268 --> 00:32:57.666
Haven't you done the same thing to us?

800
00:32:57.774 --> 00:32:59.096
- Amongst ourselves... - Come inside.

801
00:32:59.204 --> 00:33:02.246
- Come on in. - He always does the same to us.

802
00:33:02.322 --> 00:33:03.504
(All Running Man members have gathered in the waiting room.)

803
00:33:03.719 --> 00:33:04.902
- Come inside, we're safe here now. - It's all finished now.

804
00:33:04.977 --> 00:33:05.977
It's safe inside, right?

805
00:33:06.085 --> 00:33:07.590
- We can't rip name tags here. - It's a safe zone.

806
00:33:07.665 --> 00:33:10.171
(Agility Test Results: First place, Haha & Ji Hyo)

807
00:33:11.676 --> 00:33:15.084
(The tests until now were only the beginning!)

808
00:33:15.149 --> 00:33:16.224
(Missions that surpass...)

809
00:33:16.299 --> 00:33:17.697
That just gave me goosebumps.

810
00:33:17.805 --> 00:33:19.450
(your expectations will unfold!)

811
00:33:19.525 --> 00:33:20.815
Hey, Jong Kook.

812
00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:23.181
(The members aim for the extreme with everything on the line.)

813
00:33:23.256 --> 00:33:24.826
I almost ripped the name tag.

814
00:33:24.901 --> 00:33:27.159
(Today, the fifth most skilled member will be born.)

815
00:33:27.836 --> 00:33:30.277
(They have finally arrived.)

816
00:33:30.385 --> 00:33:32.427
(The Running Man Laboratory for the Fifth Official Skill Assessment)

817
00:33:32.535 --> 00:33:33.610
What is this?

818
00:33:37.158 --> 00:33:38.524
- What is this? - What is it?

819
00:33:38.588 --> 00:33:39.664
What's going on?

820
00:33:39.954 --> 00:33:41.749
(Hello)

821
00:33:42.932 --> 00:33:45.255
- Hello. - Shouldn't we be careful of them?

822
00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:46.728
I think we're in the future.

823
00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:48.555
- Hello. - It's a tunnel in here.

824
00:33:49.061 --> 00:33:50.244
What is this?

825
00:33:50.459 --> 00:33:51.706
(Welcome to the Running Lab.)

826
00:33:51.781 --> 00:33:54.469
- What is all of this? - Why is this suddenly happening?

827
00:33:54.931 --> 00:33:56.007
Is this "Star Wars"?

828
00:33:58.447 --> 00:34:02.350
(A high-tech laboratory for the Fifth Official Skill Assessment)

829
00:34:02.426 --> 00:34:04.146
(It will now be revealed.)

830
00:34:04.253 --> 00:34:06.189
- What is all of this? - It's the future.

831
00:34:08.845 --> 00:34:11.135
- It's really nice here. - It's a laboratory.

832
00:34:11.242 --> 00:34:12.425
(With cutting edge equipment...)

833
00:34:12.533 --> 00:34:14.683
(and high-class workers,)

834
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:18.016
(it is a space prepared specially for the Running Man members.)

835
00:34:18.629 --> 00:34:20.274
- The scale is huge. - Look at that.

836
00:34:20.349 --> 00:34:21.747
(Wow)

837
00:34:22.887 --> 00:34:25.112
- Look at this. - I just got goosebumps.

838
00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:26.833
I feel like we're in a sci-fi movie.

839
00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:28.263
What is this, "Agility skills"?

840
00:34:28.338 --> 00:34:30.703
- Look, they're monitoring us. - We're in there?

841
00:34:31.531 --> 00:34:34.037
- Look at that. - They're writing scripts for us.

842
00:34:35.004 --> 00:34:36.434
- My goodness, you surprised me. - What is that?

843
00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:38.337
(They're startled.)

844
00:34:40.025 --> 00:34:42.316
(What is this strange white thing?)

845
00:34:42.423 --> 00:34:43.498
- What is this? - What's that?

846
00:34:44.176 --> 00:34:46.541
(A robot of the future)

847
00:34:46.616 --> 00:34:48.907
(A robot like the ones in "Star Wars"?)

848
00:34:48.982 --> 00:34:51.315
(It seems as if Yoda will appear at any moment.)

849
00:34:52.638 --> 00:34:54.003
(Where have I seen that before?)

850
00:34:55.143 --> 00:34:56.723
- I like these things. - It's cute.

851
00:34:56.799 --> 00:34:58.229
I can't converse with it.

852
00:34:58.444 --> 00:35:00.089
- Hello. - Something like this really exists?

853
00:35:00.164 --> 00:35:01.777
- What is it? - Hello.

854
00:35:01.884 --> 00:35:03.175
Is someone inside it?

855
00:35:03.282 --> 00:35:07.260
Welcome to the Running Man Skill Assessment Laboratory.

856
00:35:08.766 --> 00:35:11.056
(Skill Assessment?)

857
00:35:11.131 --> 00:35:12.421
- It's not a joke. - We're measuring our skills today?

858
00:35:12.529 --> 00:35:16.324
In order to fulfill Haha and Seok Jin's wishes,

859
00:35:16.432 --> 00:35:18.980
we've prepared a special race.

860
00:35:21.453 --> 00:35:23.894
(Big data consisting of 284 episodes and 6 years were used.)

861
00:35:23.958 --> 00:35:27.119
(Members were assessed in agility, strength and nerve.)

862
00:35:27.227 --> 00:35:30.700
(The Fifth Official Skill Assessment has been prepared using all data.)

863
00:35:32.528 --> 00:35:35.001
When all of the skills have been averaged out,

864
00:35:35.398 --> 00:35:37.904
who will become the most skilled member?

865
00:35:38.043 --> 00:35:40.914
- It happened the way we wanted. - We'll proceed with the assessment.

866
00:35:41.022 --> 00:35:42.452
- Thank you! - It's a skill assessment today?

867
00:35:42.602 --> 00:35:45.108
- I really want to win this one. - Let's start from the same level.

868
00:35:45.215 --> 00:35:47.365
Then Kwang Soo needs to cut down his height.

869
00:35:48.333 --> 00:35:50.053
- His height... - You can just walk on your knees.

870
00:35:50.161 --> 00:35:51.236
Why should I walk on my knees?

871
00:35:51.344 --> 00:35:52.419
He has to reduce everything.

872
00:35:52.526 --> 00:35:53.709
He has to cut his arm length too.

873
00:35:53.817 --> 00:35:56.075
Then you have to attach your arms to your legs, Jong Kook.

874
00:35:56.612 --> 00:35:58.300
He'll still be like metal.

875
00:35:58.365 --> 00:36:01.021
- Jong Kook, play in a handstand. - That makes no sense.

876
00:36:01.988 --> 00:36:06.074
Today, for the winner of the Fifth Official Skill Assessment,

877
00:36:06.289 --> 00:36:08.977
a great prize will be awarded.

878
00:36:09.515 --> 00:36:12.310
- A trip to London will be given. - Really?

879
00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:13.815
London?

880
00:36:13.923 --> 00:36:15.611
- The place Gary went to? - London?

881
00:36:15.676 --> 00:36:18.546
It's better not to go. They keep recording you.

882
00:36:18.976 --> 00:36:20.589
I'm not going. I don't want to go.

883
00:36:20.697 --> 00:36:23.385
It's better not going on a trip from the broadcasting company.

884
00:36:23.492 --> 00:36:25.567
They record you for 16 hours a day.

885
00:36:25.643 --> 00:36:27.578
- Gosh. - I'd rather go to America.

886
00:36:27.653 --> 00:36:30.836
The test has already begun on your way here.

887
00:36:30.911 --> 00:36:32.986
- Has it? - Through the sudden name tag game,

888
00:36:33.062 --> 00:36:35.137
we checked your agility level.

889
00:36:35.857 --> 00:36:38.760
When we combined the reaction skill points,

890
00:36:39.513 --> 00:36:42.093
the 2 members who got their name tags ripped 2 times...

891
00:36:42.201 --> 00:36:44.534
- were Haha and Ji Hyo. - They did well.

892
00:36:44.599 --> 00:36:45.717
- That's really good. - They didn't get caught much.

893
00:36:45.824 --> 00:36:49.007
- Because I was so suspicious. - That sounds right.

894
00:36:49.405 --> 00:36:53.415
Jae Seok and Gary tied for third place, getting caught four times.

895
00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:54.888
- I see. - They did well.

896
00:36:54.996 --> 00:36:58.114
Jong Kook got caught five times and is in fifth place.

897
00:36:58.221 --> 00:37:02.092
Kwang Soo got caught six times, so he is in sixth place.

898
00:37:02.307 --> 00:37:05.533
Seok Jin got caught too many times, so he is in seventh place.

899
00:37:06.393 --> 00:37:08.651
Like this, the members are ranked from first to seventh place.

900
00:37:10.694 --> 00:37:13.704
I'm confident in playing this game, but I don't know what color to use.

901
00:37:14.349 --> 00:37:16.177
Pick up the red one!

902
00:37:16.285 --> 00:37:17.930
(Always lacking a little, a player who makes wrong guesses)

903
00:37:18.005 --> 00:37:21.446
(Seok Jin remains in seventh place once again.)

904
00:37:22.059 --> 00:37:23.704
Follow me!

905
00:37:23.811 --> 00:37:25.252
(Is he really lacking a specific skill?)

906
00:37:25.317 --> 00:37:27.144
(Special research will be conducted.)

907
00:37:27.252 --> 00:37:29.080
What's wrong with him?

908
00:37:29.295 --> 00:37:30.585
(Special research will be conducted.)

909
00:37:36.821 --> 00:37:38.359
It's been a long time.

910
00:37:38.649 --> 00:37:41.122
(What kinds of tests await the members?)

911
00:37:44.563 --> 00:37:45.993
- Hello. - Yes, come in.

912
00:37:46.068 --> 00:37:47.175
Hello.

913
00:37:47.971 --> 00:37:49.401
- Have a seat. - Okay.

914
00:37:49.509 --> 00:37:51.551
(A doctor is...)

915
00:37:51.659 --> 00:37:52.734
(in a hospital office?)

916
00:37:52.842 --> 00:37:55.777
You have to fill out this questionnaire first.

917
00:37:55.852 --> 00:37:57.712
- Okay. - Slowly read it over.

918
00:37:57.895 --> 00:37:58.970
(Glancing slightly)

919
00:38:00.476 --> 00:38:04.594
(He's trying to concentrate on the questionnaire.)

920
00:38:04.669 --> 00:38:07.034
Wait, hold on a minute.

921
00:38:07.142 --> 00:38:08.464
- What's wrong? - Wait, hold on.

922
00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:10.260
- It started already? - Stop, don't do that.

923
00:38:10.368 --> 00:38:11.443
No, stop!

924
00:38:13.131 --> 00:38:15.744
(The doctor goes down...)

925
00:38:15.819 --> 00:38:17.249
(and comes up again.)

926
00:38:17.324 --> 00:38:18.399
Has the game started?

927
00:38:18.754 --> 00:38:20.292
(Surprise!)

928
00:38:22.195 --> 00:38:23.883
(It was this person...)

929
00:38:26.388 --> 00:38:29.764
(but when Jae Seok and Jong Kook came running in,)

930
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:33.054
(there was another person under the desk!)

931
00:38:34.237 --> 00:38:36.925
(One person goes in.)

932
00:38:37.033 --> 00:38:38.968
(One person comes out.)

933
00:38:39.398 --> 00:38:41.118
- It hasn't started? - My name tag...

934
00:38:42.011 --> 00:38:45.957
(Will Seok Jin be able to catch on in this situation?)

935
00:38:48.247 --> 00:38:49.828
What is he going to do?

936
00:38:50.333 --> 00:38:51.870
Oh no.

937
00:38:52.408 --> 00:38:54.021
Isn't it too obvious? Of course he will see it.

938
00:38:55.204 --> 00:38:57.967
- My name tag... - Why are you starting already?

939
00:38:58.031 --> 00:38:59.107
Wait Seok Jin, hold on.

940
00:38:59.182 --> 00:39:01.579
Jong Kook keeps acting like this right now.

941
00:39:01.655 --> 00:39:03.300
- Do your questionnaire. - What's going on?

942
00:39:03.375 --> 00:39:05.665
- There must be something happening. - I'm going crazy.

943
00:39:06.676 --> 00:39:09.611
I write my name and do I have to write my date of birth?

944
00:39:09.719 --> 00:39:11.117
(Seok Jin sees him.)

945
00:39:14.342 --> 00:39:16.310
(He may not be...)

946
00:39:16.385 --> 00:39:18.288
(very quick-witted,)

947
00:39:18.353 --> 00:39:20.761
(but shouldn't he be able to catch on to this?)

948
00:39:25.094 --> 00:39:28.030
Do I have to write my age as it appears on the internet?

949
00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:31.363
He doesn't know!

950
00:39:31.438 --> 00:39:32.836
Seok Jin doesn't know.

951
00:39:33.664 --> 00:39:34.696
He didn't catch on.

952
00:39:34.771 --> 00:39:37.029
"How many hours on average do you sleep a day?"

953
00:39:37.136 --> 00:39:38.427
I sleep seven hours a day.

954
00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:42.297
I'm being honest. We have to be honest for this.

955
00:39:42.728 --> 00:39:45.201
"How is your daily bowel movement?"

956
00:39:46.598 --> 00:39:48.501
I think it's once every two days.

957
00:39:48.566 --> 00:39:49.899
(Second attempt)

958
00:39:50.039 --> 00:39:52.587
"Write the time and menu of your breakfast."

959
00:39:52.695 --> 00:39:53.770
I eat my breakfast a bit late.

960
00:39:53.834 --> 00:39:55.920
(Seok Jin is looking.)

961
00:40:01.006 --> 00:40:02.941
(He has no interest at all.)

962
00:40:03.049 --> 00:40:05.307
I eat breakfast around 11am.

963
00:40:06.167 --> 00:40:07.242
(That was close.)

964
00:40:08.532 --> 00:40:11.296
11am. The menu is...

965
00:40:11.403 --> 00:40:13.188
from time to time...

966
00:40:13.263 --> 00:40:14.478
My menu is...

967
00:40:14.554 --> 00:40:16.242
(Jae Seok destroys Seok Jin's concentration.)

968
00:40:17.134 --> 00:40:19.177
What are you doing? I'm doing something right now!

969
00:40:19.284 --> 00:40:20.575
Seok Jin,

970
00:40:20.682 --> 00:40:23.478
everyone else is doing the same thing.

971
00:40:23.693 --> 00:40:25.521
(Embracing)

972
00:40:26.381 --> 00:40:27.994
This is a war.

973
00:40:29.316 --> 00:40:30.467
I was writing.

974
00:40:31.187 --> 00:40:33.413
- Gosh. - Why did you do that?

975
00:40:33.477 --> 00:40:35.122
This isn't right! I'm working right now.

976
00:40:35.197 --> 00:40:36.488
Goodness.

977
00:40:36.886 --> 00:40:38.746
The menu changes often.

978
00:40:40.036 --> 00:40:41.251
(The doctor changes too.)

979
00:40:41.326 --> 00:40:42.616
Bagel.

980
00:40:44.519 --> 00:40:47.240
Seok Jin has no interest in this.

981
00:40:47.315 --> 00:40:48.745
He thinks this is about the name tag.

982
00:40:50.358 --> 00:40:52.110
"How many times do you exercise for more than 30 minutes..."

983
00:40:52.186 --> 00:40:54.121
"until you are out of breath in a week?"

984
00:40:58.422 --> 00:40:59.497
Four days.

985
00:41:00.142 --> 00:41:03.723
"In the past week, how many times did you work on the same..."

986
00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:06.808
"exercise for more than 10 minutes..."

987
00:41:07.744 --> 00:41:09.034
How can he not?

988
00:41:09.314 --> 00:41:11.002
(It's funny, but now it's become fascinating.)

989
00:41:11.077 --> 00:41:12.722
How is it possible to be like that?

990
00:41:15.163 --> 00:41:18.098
Rarely. Less than once a week.

991
00:41:18.496 --> 00:41:21.033
"Did you feel depressed?"

992
00:41:21.141 --> 00:41:22.259
Not really.

993
00:41:22.506 --> 00:41:24.764
"The following symptoms..."

994
00:41:24.904 --> 00:41:27.485
(How could he not realise that?)

995
00:41:27.592 --> 00:41:30.173
He is hilarious.

996
00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:32.323
- This is serious. - That's hilarious.

997
00:41:32.431 --> 00:41:35.119
That's funny. Someone should have done that to me too.

998
00:41:36.086 --> 00:41:38.237
Do I have any illness that I should be concerned about?

999
00:41:39.602 --> 00:41:41.570
Since I smoke, could I have lung disease?

1000
00:41:41.688 --> 00:41:45.225
(His eyes are set on the doctor for only half a second.)

1001
00:41:48.451 --> 00:41:50.290
The doctors must be disappointed.

1002
00:41:50.645 --> 00:41:52.322
Seok Jin doesn't pay any attention to them.

1003
00:41:53.515 --> 00:41:54.763
Okay.

1004
00:41:55.515 --> 00:41:56.838
Why do you keep on dropping things?

1005
00:41:58.096 --> 00:41:59.526
(I have hand tremor.)

1006
00:41:59.848 --> 00:42:01.289
Seok Jin thought he dropped something.

1007
00:42:02.214 --> 00:42:04.472
(Is that really the only strange thing here?)

1008
00:42:04.902 --> 00:42:06.837
(Seok Jin's test ends here.)

1009
00:42:06.955 --> 00:42:08.955
Look at his name tag.

1010
00:42:09.063 --> 00:42:11.256
(Seok Jin's absentmindedness is unbeatable.)

1011
00:42:11.675 --> 00:42:13.009
How could he be like that?

1012
00:42:13.718 --> 00:42:15.191
- We should... - Let's put on an act again.

1013
00:42:15.654 --> 00:42:17.374
No, stop it.

1014
00:42:18.417 --> 00:42:19.858
No.

1015
00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:22.008
- No. Don't do this to me. - Why me?

1016
00:42:22.105 --> 00:42:23.395
No, don't!

1017
00:42:24.159 --> 00:42:25.771
This is quite annoying.

1018
00:42:25.868 --> 00:42:27.696
- You guys are still at this? - Yes.

1019
00:42:28.126 --> 00:42:29.846
We were doing this while you were gone.

1020
00:42:29.954 --> 00:42:32.223
(Then, I'll join in.)

1021
00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:35.222
Don't show your back to me.

1022
00:42:35.405 --> 00:42:37.341
The doctor keeps on dropping something on the floor.

1023
00:42:38.814 --> 00:42:40.029
Don't you mean the doctors?

1024
00:42:40.136 --> 00:42:42.641
I asked him why, and he told me that he has hand tremor.

1025
00:42:43.899 --> 00:42:45.759
He keeps on picking something up.

1026
00:42:47.372 --> 00:42:49.845
He might have hand tremor, but I think your illness is more severe.

1027
00:42:50.275 --> 00:42:53.071
- I think you have a severe illness. - I...

1028
00:42:53.189 --> 00:42:54.974
I hope after you watch today's episode,

1029
00:42:55.436 --> 00:42:57.587
you don't feel bad.

1030
00:42:58.565 --> 00:43:00.565
I think people will be sad watching this.

1031
00:43:00.812 --> 00:43:01.995
Let's be honest.

1032
00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:05.016
How am I supposed to know when he ambushes me from behind?

1033
00:43:05.113 --> 00:43:06.726
(How should I know?)

1034
00:43:07.048 --> 00:43:08.016
That's not it.

1035
00:43:08.124 --> 00:43:09.736
What are you saying?

1036
00:43:09.855 --> 00:43:11.027
(Seok Jin is so amazingly slow-witted.)

1037
00:43:11.134 --> 00:43:12.424
Stop it.

1038
00:43:12.543 --> 00:43:13.618
What is it?

1039
00:43:13.715 --> 00:43:16.080
- The doctor kept changing. - They kept changing.

1040
00:43:16.188 --> 00:43:17.478
Really?

1041
00:43:19.843 --> 00:43:20.919
I didn't know.

1042
00:43:21.241 --> 00:43:22.639
I really didn't know.

1043
00:43:23.177 --> 00:43:25.187
That's why he kept on disappearing.

1044
00:43:25.445 --> 00:43:26.832
I had no clue.

1045
00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:28.671
- You really didn't know? - I had no clue.

1046
00:43:28.768 --> 00:43:31.241
This is real. He really didn't know.

1047
00:43:31.778 --> 00:43:33.283
You guys must be very sharp-sighted.

1048
00:43:33.391 --> 00:43:34.466
That's not it.

1049
00:43:34.541 --> 00:43:36.617
It's normal to realise it.

1050
00:43:36.735 --> 00:43:38.885
- It's impossible not to realise it. - You guys must be really good.

1051
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:40.380
I was concentrating on the form.

1052
00:43:40.498 --> 00:43:42.648
It's not about being sharp-sighted. It's impossible not to know.

1053
00:43:42.745 --> 00:43:43.928
(Cheer up, Seok Jin. You are only naive.)

1054
00:43:48.659 --> 00:43:51.024
What is this place?

1055
00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:57.519
(The room is filled with presents wrapped in black veil.)

1056
00:43:57.583 --> 00:43:59.626
- There must be something inside. - What is this?

1057
00:43:59.733 --> 00:44:02.540
- I think we need to touch it. - I can't.

1058
00:44:02.895 --> 00:44:04.787
I think this is to test our nerve.

1059
00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:06.400
You are correct.

1060
00:44:06.507 --> 00:44:08.873
I knew it.

1061
00:44:08.991 --> 00:44:10.163
Please listen up.

1062
00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:16.292
Based on the data we collected from previous tests on your nerve...

1063
00:44:16.367 --> 00:44:18.087
- Please bring in the data. - I don't like the sound of this.

1064
00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:21.238
I knew it. I have the highest scores.

1065
00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:22.743
From the episode of Scary Story,

1066
00:44:22.969 --> 00:44:26.549
the number of times we screamed, Jae Seok 13, Kwang Soo 12, Haha 10,

1067
00:44:26.614 --> 00:44:29.839
Gary and Seok Jin 7, Ji Hyo 6 and Jong Kook 5 times.

1068
00:44:30.162 --> 00:44:31.818
The number of times we moaned, talked to ourselves or said...

1069
00:44:31.882 --> 00:44:33.183
"Are you crazy?"

1070
00:44:34.463 --> 00:44:36.043
Jae Seok 33 times.

1071
00:44:36.946 --> 00:44:38.978
- That's unbeatable. - Seok Jin 22 times.

1072
00:44:39.301 --> 00:44:42.204
Kwang Soo 20 times, Haha 10 times and Gary 8 times.

1073
00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:44.473
When you were terrified.

1074
00:44:44.537 --> 00:44:46.903
"Are you crazy? You must be out of your mind."

1075
00:44:46.978 --> 00:44:48.236
"They're all crazy."

1076
00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:50.386
"This is crazy."

1077
00:44:50.483 --> 00:44:51.558
"Is this for real?"

1078
00:44:52.354 --> 00:44:53.494
The number of times we said...

1079
00:44:53.612 --> 00:44:54.687
"I can't do this" or "I can't go".

1080
00:44:55.182 --> 00:44:56.838
The person who said "I can't do this" the most...

1081
00:44:56.934 --> 00:44:58.117
was Seok Jin.

1082
00:44:58.300 --> 00:44:59.913
The person who said "I can't go" the most was Haha.

1083
00:45:00.343 --> 00:45:02.214
Haha said it 3 times and Seok Jin Said it 7 times.

1084
00:45:02.955 --> 00:45:04.246
"I can't do this."

1085
00:45:04.751 --> 00:45:05.977
"I can't go."

1086
00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:10.342
The number of times we grunted, Jae Seok 3 times, Ji Hyo 2 times,

1087
00:45:10.417 --> 00:45:12.310
- and Seok Jin two times. - Is this your special episode?

1088
00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:16.826
- You're a top ranker in everything. - I'm really...

1089
00:45:16.901 --> 00:45:19.159
- easily scared. - You're at the top for everything.

1090
00:45:19.234 --> 00:45:21.771
- This is a real laboratory. - They did their job properly.

1091
00:45:21.847 --> 00:45:24.137
- They really did their job. - You guys are amazing.

1092
00:45:24.255 --> 00:45:25.642
(The assessment on each member's nerve test is now complete.)

1093
00:45:26.072 --> 00:45:27.481
(The ranking of the members' nerve is in the following order.)

1094
00:45:27.578 --> 00:45:29.190
(Jong Kook, Ji Hyo, Gary, Kwang Soo,)

1095
00:45:29.298 --> 00:45:30.986
(Seok Jin and Haha in a tie and lastly, Jae Seok.)

1096
00:45:31.341 --> 00:45:34.179
The results of this test will be used in the future.

1097
00:45:34.319 --> 00:45:37.469
There are seven fish tanks under the veil.

1098
00:45:37.577 --> 00:45:38.975
- There are seven. - Fish tanks?

1099
00:45:39.082 --> 00:45:40.695
This is Ji Hyo's weak spot.

1100
00:45:40.803 --> 00:45:42.093
- I am really bad at this. - There are seven.

1101
00:45:42.534 --> 00:45:43.706
Because she hates bugs.

1102
00:45:43.781 --> 00:45:46.179
In here, there are beads.

1103
00:45:46.501 --> 00:45:47.974
Beads.

1104
00:45:48.867 --> 00:45:50.909
There are two beads in each fish tank.

1105
00:45:51.017 --> 00:45:52.490
There are a total of 14 beads.

1106
00:45:52.565 --> 00:45:55.318
The person with the toughest nerve, Jong Kook...

1107
00:45:56.286 --> 00:45:58.124
needs to get 10 beads out.

1108
00:45:58.221 --> 00:45:59.619
- Oh, no. - 10 beads?

1109
00:46:00.156 --> 00:46:03.242
- They must have prepared more. - Ji Hyo needs to get nine.

1110
00:46:03.350 --> 00:46:04.575
(Second in rank, Ji Hyo needs to get nine beads out.)

1111
00:46:04.672 --> 00:46:07.038
Third in rank, Gary needs to get eight beads out.

1112
00:46:08.113 --> 00:46:09.801
Kwang Soo needs to get seven beads.

1113
00:46:10.446 --> 00:46:12.951
Seok Jin and Haha need to get six beads each.

1114
00:46:13.059 --> 00:46:14.349
- And finally, - Jae Seok needs to get five?

1115
00:46:14.456 --> 00:46:16.284
Jae Seok only needs to get four beads.

1116
00:46:16.403 --> 00:46:17.682
(Seventh in rank, Jae Seok needs to get four beads.)

1117
00:46:18.112 --> 00:46:21.553
After you have got your assigned amount of beads out,

1118
00:46:21.779 --> 00:46:24.026
then we will record the time and the ranking will change.

1119
00:46:24.133 --> 00:46:26.897
- It's best to finish quick. - I'm good at this.

1120
00:46:26.972 --> 00:46:28.542
- We will reveal the fish tanks. - I just hope it's not bugs.

1121
00:46:28.649 --> 00:46:30.015
- Don't look. - I don't like these things.

1122
00:46:30.262 --> 00:46:32.305
I really don't like this.

1123
00:46:32.412 --> 00:46:33.703
Please be careful.

1124
00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:37.724
(An unforgettable experience awaits.)

1125
00:46:38.616 --> 00:46:40.799
(The things to test the members' nerve is revealed.)

1126
00:46:40.949 --> 00:46:42.842
- How about Jong Kook take the lead? - All right.

1127
00:46:42.917 --> 00:46:45.530
(Jong Kook starts off the nerve test.)

1128
00:46:45.745 --> 00:46:47.186
(I am bold.)

1129
00:46:47.293 --> 00:46:48.476
Can I start?

1130
00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:50.809
Start!

1131
00:46:51.486 --> 00:46:52.701
(There's no time to spare.)

1132
00:46:53.454 --> 00:46:54.744
He is so daring.

1133
00:46:55.497 --> 00:46:58.077
- What does it feel like? - I can't find it.

1134
00:46:58.185 --> 00:46:59.723
He looks like he doesn't feel a thing.

1135
00:47:01.013 --> 00:47:03.346
His arms must be too big for the hole.

1136
00:47:04.206 --> 00:47:05.464
Are the stuff inside the fish tank all the same?

1137
00:47:05.572 --> 00:47:07.356
It's difficult to find the beads.

1138
00:47:07.464 --> 00:47:08.969
They're timing me.

1139
00:47:09.077 --> 00:47:10.948
Are you all right?

1140
00:47:11.012 --> 00:47:12.625
(He is quick to find another bead.)

1141
00:47:13.485 --> 00:47:14.883
What is it?

1142
00:47:14.958 --> 00:47:16.356
- What is this? - Don't crush it.

1143
00:47:16.463 --> 00:47:18.001
What is this? Who are you?

1144
00:47:19.184 --> 00:47:20.657
- Is someone inside? - Someone's inside?

1145
00:47:20.732 --> 00:47:22.839
(He moves on with his mission despite the creepy movement.)

1146
00:47:22.947 --> 00:47:24.130
Get out!

1147
00:47:25.818 --> 00:47:27.076
Oh, my.

1148
00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:28.646
- You're too harsh. - Get out!

1149
00:47:28.753 --> 00:47:30.903
- Don't make it angry. - Who are you?

1150
00:47:30.979 --> 00:47:32.624
There's something inside this.

1151
00:47:32.731 --> 00:47:35.419
(His instinct tells him there's something inside.)

1152
00:47:35.495 --> 00:47:36.925
There is something.

1153
00:47:37.032 --> 00:47:38.430
Hey!

1154
00:47:38.537 --> 00:47:40.150
(As Jong Kook screams,)

1155
00:47:40.258 --> 00:47:41.978
(others are more frightened.)

1156
00:47:42.053 --> 00:47:43.268
I can't do this.

1157
00:47:43.483 --> 00:47:44.559
I can't do this.

1158
00:47:44.666 --> 00:47:45.924
They must be crazy.

1159
00:47:47.107 --> 00:47:50.762
Don't make the thing angry.

1160
00:47:50.838 --> 00:47:52.192
There's water inside.

1161
00:47:52.881 --> 00:47:54.235
I hate that.

1162
00:47:54.343 --> 00:47:57.461
(Jong Kook doesn't stop regardless of others' reactions.)

1163
00:47:57.568 --> 00:47:59.181
He's nearly done.

1164
00:47:59.257 --> 00:48:00.687
No, stop it.

1165
00:48:00.794 --> 00:48:03.052
- Don't make it angry. - There aren't any beads.

1166
00:48:04.235 --> 00:48:06.278
(He scoops up two beads at once.)

1167
00:48:06.385 --> 00:48:07.890
- He's amazing. - How can he do that?

1168
00:48:07.998 --> 00:48:10.256
- What's that on your hand? - What does it smell like?

1169
00:48:10.471 --> 00:48:12.836
Two, four, six, eight and ten. I have ten.

1170
00:48:12.912 --> 00:48:14.309
(Two, four, six, eight and ten)

1171
00:48:15.094 --> 00:48:17.782
- What is it? - Goodness.

1172
00:48:18.578 --> 00:48:19.933
(Jong Kook manages to get 10 beads.)

1173
00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:21.223
I was surprised.

1174
00:48:21.546 --> 00:48:23.954
- You guys are up for a scare. - What does it feel like?

1175
00:48:28.362 --> 00:48:29.438
It was you!

1176
00:48:30.147 --> 00:48:31.298
Oh no, I'm sorry.

1177
00:48:32.298 --> 00:48:33.480
I'm sorry.

1178
00:48:33.588 --> 00:48:37.351
(Why is he apologising?)

1179
00:48:37.674 --> 00:48:40.469
- Is there a person? - Maybe it's something alive.

1180
00:48:42.050 --> 00:48:44.555
- Please go first. - Yes.

1181
00:48:44.662 --> 00:48:47.458
- Us cowards will wait. - Please begin.

1182
00:48:47.565 --> 00:48:48.791
Gary, why don't you go first?

1183
00:48:49.361 --> 00:48:50.974
- How many do you need to get? - You go first.

1184
00:48:51.049 --> 00:48:52.404
Gary needs to get eight beads.

1185
00:48:53.264 --> 00:48:54.769
Get ready. Don't look.

1186
00:48:54.877 --> 00:48:56.135
Hold on to your bowl.

1187
00:48:56.210 --> 00:48:59.715
I have no nerve. The data is wrong.

1188
00:48:59.823 --> 00:49:00.898
Hey,

1189
00:49:01.005 --> 00:49:03.876
from our point of view, you're a hero.

1190
00:49:03.952 --> 00:49:05.489
We're nothing compared to you.

1191
00:49:06.102 --> 00:49:08.639
How can Jong Kook do this like it's nothing?

1192
00:49:09.715 --> 00:49:11.370
Begin!

1193
00:49:11.435 --> 00:49:12.618
(Gary needs to get eight beads.)

1194
00:49:12.725 --> 00:49:13.800
My hand won't go in.

1195
00:49:15.091 --> 00:49:17.456
(His nerves fails him from the start.)

1196
00:49:19.714 --> 00:49:20.897
Oh, my.

1197
00:49:21.155 --> 00:49:22.295
(Oh, my)

1198
00:49:24.015 --> 00:49:25.198
Something bit me.

1199
00:49:25.273 --> 00:49:26.456
That's the normal reaction.

1200
00:49:26.488 --> 00:49:27.671
- What is this? - That's normal.

1201
00:49:27.778 --> 00:49:29.283
What is this?

1202
00:49:29.606 --> 00:49:31.541
Something bit me hard.

1203
00:49:32.616 --> 00:49:36.132
(What bit Gary's hand?)

1204
00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:39.283
(The culprit was nothing other than massage balls.)

1205
00:49:40.111 --> 00:49:41.648
Something keeps on biting me.

1206
00:49:42.831 --> 00:49:44.014
Wait a minute.

1207
00:49:44.121 --> 00:49:45.196
Something bit you?

1208
00:49:45.304 --> 00:49:47.637
- It bites you? - It hurts.

1209
00:49:48.099 --> 00:49:49.390
- It hurts? - What is it?

1210
00:49:55.561 --> 00:49:57.884
- Does it hurt? - So it bites?

1211
00:49:58.604 --> 00:49:59.679
Is it scissors?

1212
00:50:00.572 --> 00:50:02.077
(Gary successfully finds his second bead.)

1213
00:50:02.185 --> 00:50:03.690
Does it bite?

1214
00:50:03.765 --> 00:50:06.238
It's fine. Gary, be careful.

1215
00:50:07.389 --> 00:50:08.636
Be careful.

1216
00:50:09.141 --> 00:50:10.324
Go. Put your hand in.

1217
00:50:10.431 --> 00:50:12.937
Wait. I can't.

1218
00:50:14.119 --> 00:50:15.195
That's the normal reaction.

1219
00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:18.098
(What is this?)

1220
00:50:18.205 --> 00:50:20.678
Wait. This feels weird.

1221
00:50:20.893 --> 00:50:22.334
- What is it? - I don't know.

1222
00:50:22.613 --> 00:50:24.119
Gary. Gary!

1223
00:50:24.226 --> 00:50:25.409
It feels like a snake.

1224
00:50:26.269 --> 00:50:28.925
(What is this?)

1225
00:50:29.495 --> 00:50:32.978
(The objects inside are massage gloves.)

1226
00:50:33.258 --> 00:50:34.871
- Gary. - It feels like a snake.

1227
00:50:37.279 --> 00:50:38.526
A snake?

1228
00:50:39.569 --> 00:50:41.430
(Scared)

1229
00:50:45.806 --> 00:50:47.171
- How could you do this? - What is it?

1230
00:50:47.236 --> 00:50:49.494
This is normal.

1231
00:50:50.106 --> 00:50:52.612
- Is it real? - I want to do this one.

1232
00:50:54.224 --> 00:50:55.407
This is no joke.

1233
00:50:57.708 --> 00:50:59.031
Why?

1234
00:50:59.966 --> 00:51:02.181
Gary, you're doing well.

1235
00:51:03.471 --> 00:51:04.546
Wait.

1236
00:51:06.912 --> 00:51:08.310
(He screams.)

1237
00:51:09.277 --> 00:51:12.073
There's water inside.

1238
00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:13.471
Why is there water?

1239
00:51:13.976 --> 00:51:20.105
(What's under the water?)

1240
00:51:22.287 --> 00:51:25.728
(The things under the water are mudfish.)

1241
00:51:27.341 --> 00:51:30.136
(Gary needs to dig the bead out from a pool of mudfish.)

1242
00:51:32.502 --> 00:51:34.007
Look at his face.

1243
00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:39.275
(Gary tries hard to find the beads.)

1244
00:51:39.921 --> 00:51:41.748
Look at the time.

1245
00:51:41.824 --> 00:51:43.576
Even if it takes forever, I'm not going back.

1246
00:51:44.329 --> 00:51:45.512
I found it.

1247
00:51:47.124 --> 00:51:48.415
- What's that? - What came out with the bead?

1248
00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:50.350
What's on the beads?

1249
00:51:53.361 --> 00:51:56.801
I think I freaked out by myself.

1250
00:51:56.877 --> 00:51:57.984
Don't touch me.

1251
00:51:58.092 --> 00:52:00.672
What is this?

1252
00:52:01.102 --> 00:52:02.253
This is...

1253
00:52:02.607 --> 00:52:03.898
crazy.

1254
00:52:04.650 --> 00:52:06.693
I'm going to try this.

1255
00:52:06.801 --> 00:52:09.166
(What is in the fish tank?)

1256
00:52:09.274 --> 00:52:10.779
Poor Gary.

1257
00:52:11.284 --> 00:52:13.467
(He's got the superb sense of touch. What's his guess?)

1258
00:52:13.574 --> 00:52:17.123
(They are wigs.)

1259
00:52:17.628 --> 00:52:18.703
Is it a living thing?

1260
00:52:19.703 --> 00:52:20.778
(There are all kinds of hair.)

1261
00:52:20.886 --> 00:52:21.961
Wait!

1262
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:29.918
It's better to do it before others.

1263
00:52:30.025 --> 00:52:32.068
There are too many. We have to do six.

1264
00:52:32.143 --> 00:52:34.294
A coward can't handle that number.

1265
00:52:38.842 --> 00:52:41.422
(Gary finds six.)

1266
00:52:42.067 --> 00:52:44.540
(He goes for the fifth one.)

1267
00:52:44.648 --> 00:52:46.841
(He is focused.)

1268
00:52:46.949 --> 00:52:48.841
(Please)

1269
00:52:48.949 --> 00:52:51.959
- What's this? - Stop doing that.

1270
00:52:52.067 --> 00:52:53.540
- Wait! - You're overreacting, aren't you?

1271
00:52:53.615 --> 00:52:56.626
Wait! I am not overreacting!

1272
00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:58.625
- Try it! - He's not overreacting.

1273
00:52:58.701 --> 00:52:59.808
Wait!

1274
00:52:59.883 --> 00:53:03.356
(What is the thing that's making him have a spasm?)

1275
00:53:03.571 --> 00:53:07.485
(It's the ginseng of the sea, sea cucumber.)

1276
00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:10.130
- Gosh... - Gosh, wait.

1277
00:53:10.238 --> 00:53:11.281
Hey.

1278
00:53:11.388 --> 00:53:12.496
(Its slimy surface is making him dance.)

1279
00:53:12.603 --> 00:53:13.678
(Gary gets one bead.)

1280
00:53:13.754 --> 00:53:14.829
He found it quickly.

1281
00:53:15.979 --> 00:53:18.130
That must be...

1282
00:53:18.947 --> 00:53:20.312
(He takes out the bead.)

1283
00:53:21.850 --> 00:53:23.248
(Gary finds all eight beads.)

1284
00:53:23.355 --> 00:53:24.645
He's good.

1285
00:53:25.366 --> 00:53:26.473
All right.

1286
00:53:28.194 --> 00:53:29.376
(He's worn-off.)

1287
00:53:30.667 --> 00:53:32.355
I want to see what was inside the second box.

1288
00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:35.612
What is it?

1289
00:53:38.698 --> 00:53:40.881
Really? Really?

1290
00:53:40.989 --> 00:53:44.214
(It's nothing, but when you don't know, it can give you a hard time.)

1291
00:53:45.612 --> 00:53:48.515
(What's inside the two boxes Gary didn't check?)

1292
00:53:49.988 --> 00:53:53.568
(There are stainless steel sponges.)

1293
00:53:53.644 --> 00:53:55.762
(And there are pasta noodles soaked in water.)

1294
00:53:55.826 --> 00:53:58.622
(There are different things in the eight boxes.)

1295
00:53:59.772 --> 00:54:01.525
(How embarrassing!)

1296
00:54:01.632 --> 00:54:03.288
(Kwang Soo goes next.)

1297
00:54:03.396 --> 00:54:06.686
- I'll start from the other end. - Seven...

1298
00:54:06.793 --> 00:54:09.342
- Kwang Soo has to do seven. - Gosh...

1299
00:54:10.449 --> 00:54:11.847
Oh dear.

1300
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:14.642
- I don't know if he'll be okay. - Gosh...

1301
00:54:15.331 --> 00:54:18.588
Don't say things like that.

1302
00:54:19.449 --> 00:54:21.384
What is that though?

1303
00:54:22.061 --> 00:54:23.782
(Jong Kook spreads fear.)

1304
00:54:26.577 --> 00:54:29.158
What is this?

1305
00:54:29.233 --> 00:54:31.244
- Kwang Soo. - He's so annoying.

1306
00:54:31.351 --> 00:54:32.813
- Where did they come from? - He's so annoying.

1307
00:54:33.243 --> 00:54:35.071
They are the two most annoying people.

1308
00:54:37.007 --> 00:54:38.910
- Why did they put that there? - Ready?

1309
00:54:40.662 --> 00:54:43.350
Just be confident. Don't be like me.

1310
00:54:43.458 --> 00:54:44.641
Go.

1311
00:54:44.748 --> 00:54:46.791
Just put it inside.

1312
00:54:47.651 --> 00:54:49.586
- It's warm inside! - Put it inside.

1313
00:54:49.662 --> 00:54:51.414
- What is it? - Just do it.

1314
00:54:52.027 --> 00:54:53.963
Kwang Soo. Come on.

1315
00:54:54.210 --> 00:54:55.500
(Kwang Soo's first objects are massage gloves.)

1316
00:54:55.608 --> 00:54:56.898
- Just go deep. - You shouldn't do that.

1317
00:54:56.973 --> 00:54:59.199
Your hands won't reach them. Put them deep inside.

1318
00:55:01.629 --> 00:55:02.779
What's that?

1319
00:55:03.532 --> 00:55:04.747
(He overreacts to scare Kwang Soo.)

1320
00:55:04.822 --> 00:55:07.220
- Kwang Soo! - It's too much!

1321
00:55:07.435 --> 00:55:09.553
Please press my shoulder.

1322
00:55:09.661 --> 00:55:10.951
- Press it so I won't take it out. - Okay.

1323
00:55:11.413 --> 00:55:12.994
(Jong Kook presses Kwang Soo's shoulder.)

1324
00:55:13.424 --> 00:55:16.434
(But Kwang Soo hesitates to put his hand down.)

1325
00:55:16.789 --> 00:55:18.155
(There's an inner conflict.)

1326
00:55:18.262 --> 00:55:20.337
It's standing up. Go.

1327
00:55:20.445 --> 00:55:22.380
Jong Kook, press him from the back.

1328
00:55:22.488 --> 00:55:24.638
(The massage glove is tired of waiting.)

1329
00:55:24.746 --> 00:55:26.219
(It touches Kwang Soo.)

1330
00:55:26.294 --> 00:55:27.939
(It suddenly touches Kwang Soo.)

1331
00:55:28.616 --> 00:55:30.444
(Kwang Soo thinks his hand almost got eaten.)

1332
00:55:30.519 --> 00:55:31.627
What's wrong? Did it bite your hand?

1333
00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:34.605
Did it bite?

1334
00:55:35.175 --> 00:55:36.358
Come back.

1335
00:55:36.465 --> 00:55:39.046
- You are wasting time. - You've already done it.

1336
00:55:39.153 --> 00:55:40.304
It licked me.

1337
00:55:40.659 --> 00:55:42.164
- It licked you? - Come on.

1338
00:55:42.422 --> 00:55:43.777
It licked you?

1339
00:55:43.884 --> 00:55:47.325
Wait. Just go deep.

1340
00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:49.153
(Kwang Soo beats Jong Kook.)

1341
00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:50.981
(You put your own hand inside!)

1342
00:55:51.486 --> 00:55:53.529
It's not moving now. Do it now.

1343
00:55:53.561 --> 00:55:54.959
It's not moving now?

1344
00:55:55.034 --> 00:55:57.077
- What is it? - What is it?

1345
00:55:58.507 --> 00:55:59.797
What could it be?

1346
00:55:59.905 --> 00:56:01.733
Open your hand. Open it.

1347
00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:03.023
(Something inside it is targeting my hand.)

1348
00:56:06.646 --> 00:56:08.689
Lower it. Lower it.

1349
00:56:08.797 --> 00:56:10.657
Lower it. Here.

1350
00:56:10.764 --> 00:56:11.915
(Mum)

1351
00:56:12.022 --> 00:56:15.033
It's frustrating because we don't know what it is.

1352
00:56:15.065 --> 00:56:16.678
- It's better to do it early. - Come on.

1353
00:56:16.753 --> 00:56:18.613
(Kwang Soo is shaking.)

1354
00:56:18.721 --> 00:56:20.764
Move to the centre.

1355
00:56:21.086 --> 00:56:22.205
(He grabs the bead.)

1356
00:56:24.247 --> 00:56:25.323
I think it's better if you don't grab him.

1357
00:56:25.387 --> 00:56:27.107
- Stop it. - How can he do six more?

1358
00:56:27.215 --> 00:56:28.365
I won't do it any more.

1359
00:56:29.548 --> 00:56:30.871
Go to the next one.

1360
00:56:31.193 --> 00:56:33.129
(He finds one bead and moves to the next box.)

1361
00:56:33.236 --> 00:56:35.387
- This is... - What is it, Kwang Soo?

1362
00:56:35.494 --> 00:56:36.784
It licked me.

1363
00:56:36.892 --> 00:56:38.075
It licked you?

1364
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:40.332
- Did it really lick you? - It licks you?

1365
00:56:40.408 --> 00:56:42.590
(Did...)

1366
00:56:42.698 --> 00:56:44.956
(this kind of thing...)

1367
00:56:45.063 --> 00:56:48.934
(lick you?)

1368
00:56:50.869 --> 00:56:53.773
- That's terrible. - Can't we wear gloves?

1369
00:56:54.095 --> 00:56:56.245
Where are you going? You are too far from them.

1370
00:56:56.353 --> 00:56:57.503
(The second box is filled with mudfish.)

1371
00:56:58.933 --> 00:57:00.622
You are still far away. Go deeper.

1372
00:57:01.191 --> 00:57:03.417
(Gosh!)

1373
00:57:03.525 --> 00:57:05.707
(He's making a big fuss.)

1374
00:57:05.922 --> 00:57:08.073
Something is stuck on his hand.

1375
00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:10.653
Can I watch from here? I will watch from here.

1376
00:57:10.761 --> 00:57:12.126
I will watch from here.

1377
00:57:13.019 --> 00:57:14.674
This is fun.

1378
00:57:15.277 --> 00:57:17.104
Now you know why I made such a fuss.

1379
00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:22.050
- Go inside. - It's better to get it done.

1380
00:57:22.158 --> 00:57:24.566
- You have to look for it too. - That is too painful.

1381
00:57:25.244 --> 00:57:26.609
(Flapping)

1382
00:57:28.254 --> 00:57:29.329
Why? What is it?

1383
00:57:29.437 --> 00:57:30.544
(His hand was like a flapping bird wing.)

1384
00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:31.727
Is there water?

1385
00:57:32.372 --> 00:57:33.448
Did it bite?

1386
00:57:33.555 --> 00:57:34.921
- Did it bite? - What is it?

1387
00:57:36.996 --> 00:57:39.899
I didn't even try that one.

1388
00:57:40.006 --> 00:57:41.189
That's the last one.

1389
00:57:41.479 --> 00:57:43.952
- Gosh. - I am dizzy.

1390
00:57:44.092 --> 00:57:46.640
Kwang Soo, just shout and do it.

1391
00:57:48.070 --> 00:57:49.758
(Shouting)

1392
00:57:50.543 --> 00:57:51.618
(He hesitates.)

1393
00:57:53.199 --> 00:57:54.737
(He's starting to automatically bounce back.)

1394
00:57:54.844 --> 00:57:56.779
This is crazy.

1395
00:57:56.887 --> 00:57:58.070
(Flinching)

1396
00:57:58.930 --> 00:58:00.650
What is it?

1397
00:58:01.403 --> 00:58:05.166
(Kwang Soo dances like a popping dancer.)

1398
00:58:05.274 --> 00:58:06.349
Is it that bad?

1399
00:58:06.424 --> 00:58:07.531
(Popping)

1400
00:58:07.607 --> 00:58:10.972
(Kwang Soo moves like popping popcorn.)

1401
00:58:11.370 --> 00:58:14.413
What is it?

1402
00:58:14.918 --> 00:58:16.208
(He skips the pasta box and moves to the next.)

1403
00:58:16.316 --> 00:58:18.391
- Why? - This is crazy.

1404
00:58:18.606 --> 00:58:19.681
I really can't do this.

1405
00:58:20.477 --> 00:58:21.617
I really can't do this.

1406
00:58:21.724 --> 00:58:23.595
But at least you touched it.

1407
00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:25.487
- I will do all the rest. - This is too funny.

1408
00:58:25.595 --> 00:58:26.745
(He skips the steel sponges.)

1409
00:58:27.315 --> 00:58:28.864
(Shivering)

1410
00:58:28.971 --> 00:58:31.293
When you can't see it, you get really scared.

1411
00:58:31.401 --> 00:58:32.584
You get surprised by stuffed toys too.

1412
00:58:33.014 --> 00:58:34.197
(Lightly tapping)

1413
00:58:35.702 --> 00:58:36.777
Is it pudding or what?

1414
00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:38.820
(It's sea pudding.)

1415
00:58:38.927 --> 00:58:41.723
- Pudding? - Then touch the pudding.

1416
00:58:42.153 --> 00:58:44.196
- Just clench your fist. - Touch the pudding.

1417
00:58:44.594 --> 00:58:47.142
- Just grab it. - Just grab it.

1418
00:58:47.852 --> 00:58:49.787
(He grabs one.)

1419
00:58:54.303 --> 00:58:55.378
(He's thrilled by the touch of the pudding.)

1420
00:58:55.486 --> 00:58:57.851
- It's making me cringe. - Time is up.

1421
00:58:58.819 --> 00:59:00.324
The time is up.

1422
00:59:00.431 --> 00:59:03.657
(Kwang Soo lacks agility, but he can do the popping dance.)

1423
00:59:04.162 --> 00:59:05.270
This is the highlight.

1424
00:59:05.635 --> 00:59:07.850
- I'm sweating. - You just have to get four.

1425
00:59:08.388 --> 00:59:09.861
You will be fine.

1426
00:59:09.936 --> 00:59:11.291
(Jae Seok is next.)

1427
00:59:11.399 --> 00:59:14.990
(Will he be able to...)

1428
00:59:15.097 --> 00:59:20.538
(stop being a coward?)

1429
00:59:22.226 --> 00:59:23.301
Ready.

1430
00:59:23.409 --> 00:59:24.946
(He has to get just four beads.)

1431
00:59:25.054 --> 00:59:27.097
Start.

1432
00:59:27.172 --> 00:59:29.182
I know him. I know him.

1433
00:59:29.247 --> 00:59:30.537
You have to put your hand in one go.

1434
00:59:30.645 --> 00:59:32.042
He won't even be able to get one bead.

1435
00:59:32.225 --> 00:59:34.193
- This doesn't make sense. - Go inside.

1436
00:59:35.698 --> 00:59:37.784
What are you doing right now?

1437
00:59:37.849 --> 00:59:38.924
Just put it inside.

1438
00:59:39.031 --> 00:59:41.010
(He already feels like he's touched the bottom of the box.)

1439
00:59:41.074 --> 00:59:42.364
- He... - It's all right.

1440
00:59:42.472 --> 00:59:44.268
You didn't even go inside.

1441
00:59:44.343 --> 00:59:45.375
(He hesitates.)

1442
00:59:45.483 --> 00:59:47.310
- Why is it hot inside? - Jae Seok!

1443
00:59:47.386 --> 00:59:48.923
You only put this much.

1444
00:59:49.031 --> 00:59:50.321
You only put this much inside.

1445
00:59:50.428 --> 00:59:52.901
- What's wrong with you? - But it's slightly warm.

1446
00:59:52.977 --> 00:59:54.514
- It's not warm. - Maybe something is breathing?

1447
00:59:54.622 --> 00:59:55.772
No.

1448
00:59:56.063 --> 00:59:58.213
- It's your heart that's hot. - It smells differently too.

1449
00:59:59.783 --> 01:00:01.826
- He... - Just put it inside.

1450
01:00:03.836 --> 01:00:06.234
Go down. No, go down more.

1451
01:00:06.341 --> 01:00:08.857
- No. - It's following his hand.

1452
01:00:09.675 --> 01:00:11.072
(Screaming)

1453
01:00:12.298 --> 01:00:13.545
- This is really... - Jae Seok.

1454
01:00:13.653 --> 01:00:16.309
(He almost has a heart attack.)

1455
01:00:18.351 --> 01:00:19.351
Let's do this again.

1456
01:00:19.459 --> 01:00:20.685
Don't trust what Kwang Soo says.

1457
01:00:20.792 --> 01:00:22.652
- But it's really following him. - Let's do this.

1458
01:00:23.082 --> 01:00:25.803
- Just go in. - Go to the centre. It's moving.

1459
01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:27.136
Just go in.

1460
01:00:27.243 --> 01:00:29.781
(The glove kisses Jae Seok's hand too.)

1461
01:00:30.749 --> 01:00:31.824
Something's inside.

1462
01:00:32.254 --> 01:00:33.329
Something is inside!

1463
01:00:33.404 --> 01:00:34.512
(He's going mad.)

1464
01:00:34.587 --> 01:00:36.340
- Something is inside. - It's all right.

1465
01:00:36.737 --> 01:00:38.060
Some thing is really inside!

1466
01:00:38.168 --> 01:00:39.243
It's okay.

1467
01:00:39.641 --> 01:00:41.898
It kissed my hand, didn't it?

1468
01:00:44.296 --> 01:00:46.877
- It follows his hand. - Jae Seok, did it bite you?

1469
01:00:47.565 --> 01:00:49.887
Thank goodness I took my hand out before it licked my hand.

1470
01:00:49.962 --> 01:00:51.930
Otherwise, it would've licked and bitten my hand.

1471
01:00:52.866 --> 01:00:54.263
What is it really?

1472
01:00:56.553 --> 01:00:58.994
- I experienced that too. - Is it big?

1473
01:00:59.102 --> 01:01:00.467
- I don't know either. - It licks you?

1474
01:01:00.575 --> 01:01:02.897
- It was... - Was it wet or dry?

1475
01:01:03.005 --> 01:01:04.661
- It's wet. - It's dry.

1476
01:01:04.768 --> 01:01:05.843
It's wet?

1477
01:01:05.951 --> 01:01:08.596
(It's wet?)

1478
01:01:08.703 --> 01:01:11.391
(Is it always wet like this guy?)

1479
01:01:12.972 --> 01:01:14.402
Just go to the next one.

1480
01:01:14.509 --> 01:01:16.337
- If you fail here... - Ready.

1481
01:01:16.982 --> 01:01:19.746
Put your hand inside while screaming. One, two, three!

1482
01:01:20.315 --> 01:01:22.251
- Isn't it upset right now? - Gary made us more scared.

1483
01:01:22.358 --> 01:01:23.831
Isn't it upset right now?

1484
01:01:24.799 --> 01:01:26.552
- Do it now. - In 1, 2, 3.

1485
01:01:28.025 --> 01:01:30.100
(High-five!)

1486
01:01:31.788 --> 01:01:32.863
(Screaming)

1487
01:01:32.938 --> 01:01:35.153
Did you see it?

1488
01:01:35.261 --> 01:01:36.551
It came to meet me.

1489
01:01:36.659 --> 01:01:38.777
- It came to meet me. - Did you touch its face?

1490
01:01:39.852 --> 01:01:41.605
It was waiting for him.

1491
01:01:42.142 --> 01:01:43.368
- It was waiting for me. - Did you touch its face?

1492
01:01:43.475 --> 01:01:44.938
It was waiting for me!

1493
01:01:45.690 --> 01:01:47.378
How can it jump like that?

1494
01:01:48.346 --> 01:01:50.711
- It jumps too? - It jumps?

1495
01:01:51.217 --> 01:01:53.045
Don't pick that one. That one is too tough.

1496
01:01:53.152 --> 01:01:54.722
- Just pass it. - I'll pass it.

1497
01:01:54.830 --> 01:01:56.550
- I can't do it. - This is so annoying.

1498
01:01:56.657 --> 01:01:58.345
(He skips the one that jumps and licks.)

1499
01:01:59.238 --> 01:02:00.571
Do it on the count of three.

1500
01:02:00.679 --> 01:02:02.324
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

1501
01:02:02.431 --> 01:02:03.539
How deep is it?

1502
01:02:05.044 --> 01:02:07.194
You didn't even get there.

1503
01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:09.667
- What's this? - Let me see.

1504
01:02:09.850 --> 01:02:11.431
That's just sweat.

1505
01:02:11.495 --> 01:02:12.753
What's in there?

1506
01:02:13.215 --> 01:02:15.731
- What's this? - Just do it.

1507
01:02:15.839 --> 01:02:17.731
Answer me, what is it?

1508
01:02:20.602 --> 01:02:23.215
- Jae Seok... - What's wrong with it?

1509
01:02:23.968 --> 01:02:26.118
It's a mess. It's a mess down there.

1510
01:02:26.225 --> 01:02:27.559
- It's a mess. - If you touch them...

1511
01:02:27.666 --> 01:02:28.806
(Touching)

1512
01:02:30.526 --> 01:02:32.677
Don't do that. Don't do that.

1513
01:02:32.784 --> 01:02:35.085
You've shocked them. They are going crazy.

1514
01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:36.655
- They are going crazy. - I can see the bead.

1515
01:02:36.762 --> 01:02:39.235
There's more than one thing?

1516
01:02:39.343 --> 01:02:40.848
(He angrily touches them.)

1517
01:02:40.956 --> 01:02:41.923
(Gosh!)

1518
01:02:42.031 --> 01:02:44.181
Gosh!

1519
01:02:44.289 --> 01:02:46.117
Why do you make them fly?

1520
01:02:47.192 --> 01:02:48.805
- They fly? - They fly?

1521
01:02:48.912 --> 01:02:49.987
(They fly?)

1522
01:02:50.063 --> 01:02:51.428
- I can't do this. - Pass it.

1523
01:02:51.998 --> 01:02:53.471
What is it?

1524
01:02:53.536 --> 01:02:55.148
- It's something very new. - Tell us.

1525
01:02:55.686 --> 01:02:57.664
- I really don't know. - Okay.

1526
01:02:57.729 --> 01:02:59.987
- I've never seen this. - All right.

1527
01:03:00.245 --> 01:03:01.460
Is it something you don't know?

1528
01:03:01.567 --> 01:03:02.675
What is this?

1529
01:03:03.503 --> 01:03:04.718
It doesn't look like anything I know.

1530
01:03:04.976 --> 01:03:06.653
- This... - What?

1531
01:03:09.277 --> 01:03:12.502
(He lost his words.)

1532
01:03:12.610 --> 01:03:14.545
You haven't touched it yet.

1533
01:03:14.653 --> 01:03:15.943
What's that?

1534
01:03:17.126 --> 01:03:18.308
What's this?

1535
01:03:18.416 --> 01:03:19.491
What is it?

1536
01:03:19.599 --> 01:03:21.534
- What is it? - I don't know.

1537
01:03:21.641 --> 01:03:23.932
(Screaming)

1538
01:03:24.867 --> 01:03:26.157
What is it?

1539
01:03:27.125 --> 01:03:28.200
What is it?

1540
01:03:28.308 --> 01:03:32.931
(Pasta can be this scary.)

1541
01:03:33.469 --> 01:03:34.608
I can't do it.

1542
01:03:34.931 --> 01:03:37.662
(Jae Seok gets zero beads.)

1543
01:03:38.157 --> 01:03:39.877
That felt slippery.

1544
01:03:39.984 --> 01:03:42.135
- What is it? - This is the best.

1545
01:03:42.210 --> 01:03:43.285
What are you talking about?

1546
01:03:44.285 --> 01:03:46.909
(He looks miserable.)

1547
01:03:47.016 --> 01:03:48.307
- What is it? - Oh.

1548
01:03:49.016 --> 01:03:50.134
Is it nothing?

1549
01:03:50.457 --> 01:03:52.070
- It comes out here. - What is this?

1550
01:03:52.285 --> 01:03:54.435
- I don't know. - I still can't tell what it is.

1551
01:03:56.801 --> 01:03:57.940
(It's pasta.)

1552
01:03:58.843 --> 01:04:01.209
(For goodness' sake)

1553
01:04:01.273 --> 01:04:02.392
(It was just pasta.)

1554
01:04:02.499 --> 01:04:03.499
Are you okay?

1555
01:04:03.574 --> 01:04:04.574
(He was afraid of getting bitten by pasta.)

1556
01:04:04.650 --> 01:04:07.230
I didn't know it was this colour.

1557
01:04:07.338 --> 01:04:10.348
(Jae Seok has a weak heart.)

1558
01:04:10.413 --> 01:04:12.176
- What is it? - Okay.

1559
01:04:12.821 --> 01:04:14.111
Put your hand in there.

1560
01:04:14.757 --> 01:04:16.434
You're not touching it.

1561
01:04:17.014 --> 01:04:18.305
Reach in.

1562
01:04:18.412 --> 01:04:19.917
(Haha is so loud.)

1563
01:04:21.638 --> 01:04:22.928
This is horrible.

1564
01:04:23.036 --> 01:04:24.143
Keep going.

1565
01:04:25.218 --> 01:04:26.218
(Screaming)

1566
01:04:26.326 --> 01:04:27.982
- This is insane. - I can't do this.

1567
01:04:28.261 --> 01:04:29.702
- What's this? - Go up.

1568
01:04:30.024 --> 01:04:31.745
- Is it a reptile? - Go up.

1569
01:04:32.067 --> 01:04:33.142
- Is it a reptile? - Go up.

1570
01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:35.895
- It's not... - Is it an amphibian?

1571
01:04:35.970 --> 01:04:37.228
It's not what you're imagining.

1572
01:04:37.336 --> 01:04:38.949
- Grab it. - Go like this.

1573
01:04:39.056 --> 01:04:41.379
What is it? What is this?

1574
01:04:41.852 --> 01:04:44.432
- There are hundreds of them. - No.

1575
01:04:44.712 --> 01:04:45.787
Are these snakes?

1576
01:04:46.367 --> 01:04:47.980
In 1, 2, 3.

1577
01:04:48.088 --> 01:04:49.163
(He touches it.)

1578
01:04:49.271 --> 01:04:51.959
(He reached it.)

1579
01:04:52.281 --> 01:04:53.356
What is it?

1580
01:04:53.679 --> 01:04:54.754
What is it?

1581
01:04:57.227 --> 01:04:58.947
- Hey. - Go the other way.

1582
01:04:59.055 --> 01:05:00.668
(He touches it.)

1583
01:05:01.635 --> 01:05:02.668
(He is terrified.)

1584
01:05:02.775 --> 01:05:04.323
- It actually moved. - That's crazy.

1585
01:05:06.753 --> 01:05:08.334
It moved.

1586
01:05:08.839 --> 01:05:10.086
It moved.

1587
01:05:10.237 --> 01:05:11.312
It really did.

1588
01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:14.000
It hit my hand.

1589
01:05:15.032 --> 01:05:16.151
- Wow. - Come on.

1590
01:05:17.505 --> 01:05:19.011
- Okay. - Wait.

1591
01:05:19.269 --> 01:05:21.419
Oh my gosh.

1592
01:05:21.527 --> 01:05:25.784
(Haha shouts like a man but gets scared like a child.)

1593
01:05:26.322 --> 01:05:27.870
(Meanwhile, Seok Jin...)

1594
01:05:27.978 --> 01:05:30.558
- It seems scary. - What?

1595
01:05:31.806 --> 01:05:32.924
- Wow. - He found one.

1596
01:05:33.569 --> 01:05:35.106
(He gets one bead.)

1597
01:05:35.504 --> 01:05:37.397
- Keep going. - Go to the next one.

1598
01:05:37.655 --> 01:05:39.160
- What's this? - What?

1599
01:05:40.407 --> 01:05:42.923
(Seok Jin now has two beads.)

1600
01:05:43.138 --> 01:05:44.751
He's so brave.

1601
01:05:44.891 --> 01:05:46.041
(Seok Jin goes for the wig box.)

1602
01:05:46.149 --> 01:05:48.837
(He tries to find a bead.)

1603
01:05:48.944 --> 01:05:50.267
(He finds it.)

1604
01:05:50.342 --> 01:05:53.030
- He has three. - Good job.

1605
01:05:53.095 --> 01:05:54.643
(Seok Jin now has three beads.)

1606
01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:55.826
- He got three. - Nice.

1607
01:05:56.041 --> 01:05:58.621
(Seok Jin is quite brave.)

1608
01:05:59.266 --> 01:06:00.342
(Ji Hyo is the last one to go.)

1609
01:06:00.879 --> 01:06:02.599
- My head hurts. - Get ready.

1610
01:06:02.707 --> 01:06:03.782
- Get ready. - Come on.

1611
01:06:04.427 --> 01:06:07.072
They're making us touch the stuff we don't even know.

1612
01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:08.793
- What is it? - What are those?

1613
01:06:09.373 --> 01:06:11.309
- Don't lie. - Okay.

1614
01:06:11.878 --> 01:06:12.954
What is it?

1615
01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:15.502
(Ji Hyo can bungee jump, but she's scared of insects.)

1616
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:18.115
- You shouldn't look. - Okay.

1617
01:06:19.545 --> 01:06:21.523
I think I'm going to cry.

1618
01:06:23.028 --> 01:06:24.673
(She is shaking.)

1619
01:06:26.641 --> 01:06:29.114
Why are you being so girly today?

1620
01:06:29.372 --> 01:06:30.555
- Ji Hyo. - Why?

1621
01:06:30.662 --> 01:06:31.737
- Come on. - Don't cry.

1622
01:06:31.802 --> 01:06:32.952
- Ji Hyo. - It's okay.

1623
01:06:33.028 --> 01:06:34.425
You've become so girly...

1624
01:06:34.533 --> 01:06:36.210
- after you got married. - It's okay.

1625
01:06:36.318 --> 01:06:37.436
- Come on. - I can't believe it.

1626
01:06:37.544 --> 01:06:40.447
- What are you doing? - Did Chen Bolin change you?

1627
01:06:40.619 --> 01:06:42.952
I thought you went through a breakup or something.

1628
01:06:43.242 --> 01:06:45.102
- Don't cry. - Kwang Soo. Or someone...

1629
01:06:45.177 --> 01:06:46.285
No, not you.

1630
01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:48.511
Jong Kook, can you put me in there?

1631
01:06:48.618 --> 01:06:50.016
Do you want me to put you in there?

1632
01:06:50.984 --> 01:06:52.446
- No. Hold my arm. - I can help.

1633
01:06:52.553 --> 01:06:54.381
No, I don't want your help.

1634
01:06:54.489 --> 01:06:56.747
- I'll grab your arm. - Okay.

1635
01:06:56.929 --> 01:06:58.402
- Ready? - Can I put my fist in?

1636
01:06:58.510 --> 01:06:59.972
- Of course. - Make it pass out.

1637
01:07:00.048 --> 01:07:01.736
- Make it unconscious. - Knock it out.

1638
01:07:01.843 --> 01:07:03.133
I think you should knock it out.

1639
01:07:04.316 --> 01:07:05.639
- Ji Hyo. - Just hit it.

1640
01:07:06.606 --> 01:07:07.682
(Whimpering)

1641
01:07:07.972 --> 01:07:09.907
You still have a long way to go.

1642
01:07:10.015 --> 01:07:11.090
Jong Kook.

1643
01:07:11.197 --> 01:07:12.595
- You have to go more. - Ji Hyo.

1644
01:07:12.810 --> 01:07:13.885
Wait!

1645
01:07:14.638 --> 01:07:17.176
(Screaming)

1646
01:07:17.283 --> 01:07:18.724
- Are you giving birth? - Keep going.

1647
01:07:18.831 --> 01:07:20.261
I thought...

1648
01:07:20.337 --> 01:07:21.659
- Come on. - I understand.

1649
01:07:21.767 --> 01:07:22.810
Am I your midwife?

1650
01:07:22.917 --> 01:07:24.487
I understand you.

1651
01:07:24.594 --> 01:07:25.713
(Crying out loud)

1652
01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:28.293
- I can't do this. - I understand you.

1653
01:07:28.401 --> 01:07:30.078
You just have to go in.

1654
01:07:30.153 --> 01:07:33.024
- Hold me, Jong Kook. - Okay.

1655
01:07:33.454 --> 01:07:34.852
(She touches it.)

1656
01:07:37.110 --> 01:07:39.260
- It's electrostatic. - It's okay.

1657
01:07:39.368 --> 01:07:42.378
It gave me a shock. It shocked me!

1658
01:07:42.593 --> 01:07:44.206
- It's electrostatic. - I saw it.

1659
01:07:44.271 --> 01:07:46.357
- I saw it. - It's okay.

1660
01:07:46.421 --> 01:07:47.862
I saw that you touched it.

1661
01:07:48.432 --> 01:07:50.120
I understand why you're so frightened.

1662
01:07:50.227 --> 01:07:51.948
- It's okay. - I feel you.

1663
01:07:52.055 --> 01:07:53.453
- I understand you. - It's okay.

1664
01:07:53.517 --> 01:07:54.593
- It's okay. - I understand.

1665
01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:56.205
You should go to the next one.

1666
01:07:56.313 --> 01:07:57.786
- Go to the next one. - Do the next one.

1667
01:07:57.861 --> 01:07:59.431
- It gave me a shock. - Okay.

1668
01:08:00.334 --> 01:08:02.409
- It's okay. - We can't help you.

1669
01:08:02.517 --> 01:08:03.775
(Now it's the pasta.)

1670
01:08:03.882 --> 01:08:05.818
- Let's do this one. - It's okay.

1671
01:08:05.882 --> 01:08:07.785
Did they bring it from "Law of the Jungle"?

1672
01:08:08.506 --> 01:08:10.011
(What is it this time?)

1673
01:08:11.301 --> 01:08:13.269
It's okay because this one's warm.

1674
01:08:13.376 --> 01:08:15.527
- Ready. - I guess it lives in warm water.

1675
01:08:15.602 --> 01:08:17.279
- It's okay. - It's fine.

1676
01:08:17.387 --> 01:08:19.473
It won't bite you. It's not harmful.

1677
01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:21.731
- Just go for it. - It's okay. It won't hurt you.

1678
01:08:22.161 --> 01:08:23.666
Why is it so humid?

1679
01:08:24.096 --> 01:08:25.817
(What? It's damp?)

1680
01:08:25.924 --> 01:08:27.967
- It's okay. - It's really damp.

1681
01:08:28.569 --> 01:08:29.580
It's damp inside.

1682
01:08:29.687 --> 01:08:30.762
Because it needs to breathe.

1683
01:08:30.870 --> 01:08:32.515
Just be bold and put your hand in.

1684
01:08:32.623 --> 01:08:35.171
You'll feel the humidity. It's not pleasant.

1685
01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:37.321
Put your hand in. It's something you like.

1686
01:08:37.429 --> 01:08:38.504
- Keep going. - Put your hand in.

1687
01:08:38.999 --> 01:08:40.332
- Trust me. - Trust us.

1688
01:08:40.654 --> 01:08:43.267
Ji Hyo, trust me.

1689
01:08:43.557 --> 01:08:44.955
- Haha, you are so shameless. - Really.

1690
01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:46.202
- Seriously. - And...

1691
01:08:46.310 --> 01:08:48.643
please don't pretend to be brave.

1692
01:08:49.041 --> 01:08:51.009
- What do you mean, "Trust me"? - Come on.

1693
01:08:51.084 --> 01:08:52.654
- Don't say that. - It's okay.

1694
01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:54.632
- Don't worry. - It's okay.

1695
01:08:56.245 --> 01:08:57.460
- Did you touch it? - No, not yet.

1696
01:08:57.535 --> 01:08:58.503
Did you touch it yet?

1697
01:08:58.610 --> 01:09:00.438
- Spread out your fingers. - Do it.

1698
01:09:00.546 --> 01:09:01.836
(She spreads out her fingers.)

1699
01:09:02.481 --> 01:09:05.277
- Not like that. - Not that way.

1700
01:09:05.384 --> 01:09:07.319
Spread vertically. That won't help.

1701
01:09:07.427 --> 01:09:09.857
- That was so stupid. - Come on.

1702
01:09:10.255 --> 01:09:12.007
- Spread your fingers. - It's okay.

1703
01:09:12.513 --> 01:09:13.556
Keep your wrist straight.

1704
01:09:13.663 --> 01:09:15.201
(She tries to touch it.)

1705
01:09:15.276 --> 01:09:16.523
Keep going. It's not there.

1706
01:09:16.631 --> 01:09:18.351
- It's not there. - In 1, 2, 3.

1707
01:09:18.964 --> 01:09:20.437
- Good. - That's good.

1708
01:09:20.501 --> 01:09:21.577
- You're almost there. - Touch it with your fingers.

1709
01:09:21.727 --> 01:09:23.050
(She screams...)

1710
01:09:23.157 --> 01:09:25.060
(and falls on the floor.)

1711
01:09:27.211 --> 01:09:28.608
- Come on. - It's not scary.

1712
01:09:28.673 --> 01:09:29.899
- Come on. - It won't bite.

1713
01:09:30.006 --> 01:09:32.049
- You almost made it. - Let's go to the next one.

1714
01:09:32.157 --> 01:09:33.662
(She cries.)

1715
01:09:33.769 --> 01:09:36.672
- It's okay. - Don't cry.

1716
01:09:36.845 --> 01:09:38.715
- Just do this one. - Just this last one.

1717
01:09:38.823 --> 01:09:41.188
- This is the last one. - Just this one.

1718
01:09:41.436 --> 01:09:43.016
- Okay. - Do just this one.

1719
01:09:43.124 --> 01:09:44.769
If this doesn't work, we'll stop here.

1720
01:09:44.844 --> 01:09:46.457
- This is your last try. - This is the last one.

1721
01:09:46.564 --> 01:09:48.070
- Go in. - Put your hand in.

1722
01:09:49.639 --> 01:09:51.295
- What is it? - It's okay.

1723
01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:53.983
Is this something to cry over?

1724
01:09:54.413 --> 01:09:55.704
Don't cry, Ji Hyo.

1725
01:09:55.811 --> 01:09:58.069
- Come on. - Don't cry.

1726
01:09:58.284 --> 01:09:59.897
- I touched something. - I will...

1727
01:10:00.112 --> 01:10:01.617
- throw you a towel. - Did you touch it?

1728
01:10:02.004 --> 01:10:03.230
I touched something.

1729
01:10:03.338 --> 01:10:04.950
- Do I spread my fingers? - Yes.

1730
01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:06.886
(It touched her.)

1731
01:10:07.133 --> 01:10:08.283
(Screaming)

1732
01:10:08.348 --> 01:10:10.111
What is it?

1733
01:10:10.219 --> 01:10:12.434
(She is jerking her body.)

1734
01:10:13.444 --> 01:10:14.520
(He throws a towel.)

1735
01:10:15.552 --> 01:10:17.993
(Ji Hyo gives up.)

1736
01:10:18.068 --> 01:10:19.960
- Stop. - Don't do it.

1737
01:10:20.111 --> 01:10:21.186
- No. - Come here.

1738
01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:23.551
- What is it? - Wipe your tears and come here.

1739
01:10:23.659 --> 01:10:24.734
You should stop.

1740
01:10:25.379 --> 01:10:27.100
You can swear now.

1741
01:10:27.207 --> 01:10:28.314
- Take a look. - You can swear.

1742
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:30.497
They're steel sponges.

1743
01:10:30.648 --> 01:10:32.260
- Come here. - It's just pasta.

1744
01:10:34.303 --> 01:10:35.486
You've had pasta before, right?

1745
01:10:35.594 --> 01:10:38.604
Doesn't this make you angry?

1746
01:10:39.034 --> 01:10:42.152
- Seriously. - I hated the last one.

1747
01:10:42.217 --> 01:10:44.410
(Ji Hyo is hard to tell. She was just cute today.)

1748
01:10:44.733 --> 01:10:46.023
(In the order of the bravest: 1. Jong Kook, 2. Gary, 3. Seok Jin,)

1749
01:10:46.131 --> 01:10:47.636
(4. Kwang Soo, 5. Ji Hyo, 6. Haha 7. Jae Seok)

1750
01:10:48.389 --> 01:10:50.862
(Official Skill Assessment: 1. Jong Kook, 2. Gary, 3. Ji Hyo,)

1751
01:10:50.926 --> 01:10:53.507
(4. Seok Jin and Kwang Soo, 6. Haha, 7. Jae Seok)

1752
01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:55.915
We are all so tired.

1753
01:10:56.130 --> 01:10:57.775
- That scared me. - It's here again.

1754
01:10:57.850 --> 01:11:00.216
- It's Seok Jin's ideal woman. - Next up is the Strength Test.

1755
01:11:00.323 --> 01:11:02.721
- A strength test. - I will check your...

1756
01:11:02.796 --> 01:11:05.269
- rankings solely on strength. - I see.

1757
01:11:05.592 --> 01:11:07.312
- The strongest is... - It's Jong Kook.

1758
01:11:07.452 --> 01:11:08.925
- Who's the second? - I could be the second.

1759
01:11:09.032 --> 01:11:10.538
- That's expected. - Yes.

1760
01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:12.645
- Gary's the second. - I see.

1761
01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:14.193
- Is it me? Not Jae Seok? - Oh.

1762
01:11:14.301 --> 01:11:16.451
- What about Kwang Soo? - Haha.

1763
01:11:16.559 --> 01:11:17.957
- I see. - Kwang Soo is strong.

1764
01:11:18.064 --> 01:11:19.096
Song Ji Hyo.

1765
01:11:19.204 --> 01:11:20.247
(1. Jong Kook, 2. Gary, 3. Kwang Soo,)

1766
01:11:20.354 --> 01:11:22.795
(4. Jae Seok, 5. Haha, 6. Ji Hyo, 7. Seok Jin)

1767
01:11:22.903 --> 01:11:24.408
Ji Hyo is stronger than me?

1768
01:11:24.945 --> 01:11:26.021
(You're weaker than me.)

1769
01:11:26.128 --> 01:11:29.246
We'll test your strength.

1770
01:11:29.461 --> 01:11:31.397
With your arms tied to a pole,

1771
01:11:31.504 --> 01:11:34.440
you have to make a wrap with...

1772
01:11:34.515 --> 01:11:37.633
all the ingredients and eat it.

1773
01:11:37.697 --> 01:11:40.213
Jong Kook will get the shortest rubber band...

1774
01:11:40.751 --> 01:11:43.579
because he's the strongest.

1775
01:11:43.654 --> 01:11:44.729
(The length of the rubber band depends on the ranking.)

1776
01:11:44.837 --> 01:11:46.772
- That's good. - Seok Jin will get the...

1777
01:11:46.944 --> 01:11:49.783
- longest rubber band. - I see.

1778
01:11:49.890 --> 01:11:52.428
- Okay. - Jae Seok, Haha, Ji Hyo...

1779
01:11:52.503 --> 01:11:53.868
and Seok Jin will go first.

1780
01:11:54.083 --> 01:11:55.051
Ready.

1781
01:11:55.159 --> 01:11:56.449
Goodness!

1782
01:11:58.707 --> 01:12:01.029
(Jae Seok: 70cm, Haha: 75cm, Ji Hyo: 80cm, Seok Jin: 90cm)

1783
01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:03.470
Jae Seok is almost done.

1784
01:12:05.051 --> 01:12:06.771
(Did Jae Seok get the lettuce, garlic and mushroom?)

1785
01:12:06.986 --> 01:12:08.276
(Back to the beginning)

1786
01:12:09.846 --> 01:12:10.964
I got it.

1787
01:12:11.029 --> 01:12:13.007
(The time is measured when they eat the wrap.)

1788
01:12:13.072 --> 01:12:14.297
(Ji Hyo is trying hard.)

1789
01:12:14.405 --> 01:12:15.588
You have to put it in your mouth.

1790
01:12:15.695 --> 01:12:17.448
I forgot the mushroom.

1791
01:12:18.061 --> 01:12:20.211
Ask Chen Bolin to pass it to you.

1792
01:12:21.179 --> 01:12:23.222
(He's so petty.)

1793
01:12:23.329 --> 01:12:24.727
(They both try their best.)

1794
01:12:26.555 --> 01:12:28.275
It's missing meat.

1795
01:12:28.382 --> 01:12:29.458
(I will win against Ji Hyo.)

1796
01:12:30.748 --> 01:12:32.425
(Oh gosh.)

1797
01:12:33.361 --> 01:12:34.651
She makes it.

1798
01:12:35.586 --> 01:12:36.877
- Oh gosh. - She's angry.

1799
01:12:36.984 --> 01:12:38.059
She's really angry.

1800
01:12:38.167 --> 01:12:39.350
This is tough.

1801
01:12:39.414 --> 01:12:41.607
(1. Jae Seok, 2. Haha, 3. Seok Jin, 4. Ji Hyo)

1802
01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:43.435
This is too short.

1803
01:12:43.758 --> 01:12:45.478
- It'll be hard. - Ready.

1804
01:12:46.188 --> 01:12:48.274
(Pulling hard)

1805
01:12:48.553 --> 01:12:49.779
Go, Gary!

1806
01:12:49.887 --> 01:12:51.456
(Jong Kook: 30cm, Gary: 40cm, Kwang Soo: 50cm)

1807
01:12:52.747 --> 01:12:55.048
(Jong Kook is the strongest among them.)

1808
01:12:55.112 --> 01:12:58.198
(He's as strong as a tiger.)

1809
01:12:59.563 --> 01:13:00.961
(Reaching for the meat)

1810
01:13:02.574 --> 01:13:04.359
Jong Kook's doing well.

1811
01:13:04.466 --> 01:13:06.015
- Just a little more. - Just a bit more.

1812
01:13:06.122 --> 01:13:08.057
- Keep going. - Just a bit more.

1813
01:13:08.165 --> 01:13:09.240
(Kwang Soo reaches for the lettuce.)

1814
01:13:09.993 --> 01:13:13.218
- Gosh. - Go, Kwang Soo!

1815
01:13:13.283 --> 01:13:16.659
(Kwang Soo is about to eat the wrap.)

1816
01:13:16.767 --> 01:13:18.594
(Jong Kook gets it in first.)

1817
01:13:18.659 --> 01:13:20.637
- He got it. - Wow.

1818
01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:23.110
- Jong Kook did it. - He's the first.

1819
01:13:23.218 --> 01:13:24.250
(1. Jong Kook, 2. Kwang Soo, 3. Gary)

1820
01:13:24.325 --> 01:13:26.121
- Jong Kook won? - Yes.

1821
01:13:27.519 --> 01:13:28.486
(Jong Kook is the strongest.)

1822
01:13:28.594 --> 01:13:30.852
Is this really a fair game?

1823
01:13:31.529 --> 01:13:33.680
- Gosh. - This isn't fair.

1824
01:13:34.572 --> 01:13:35.690
(1. Jae Seok, 2. Haha, 3. Jong Kook, 4. Kwang Soo,)

1825
01:13:35.798 --> 01:13:37.088
(5. Gary, 6. Seok Jin, 7. Ji Hyo)

1826
01:13:37.518 --> 01:13:39.303
(Final result: 1. Jong Kook, 2. Jae Seok,)

1827
01:13:39.378 --> 01:13:41.249
(3. Gary, Kwang Soo and Haha, 6. Seok Jin and Ji Hyo)

1828
01:13:42.281 --> 01:13:44.722
(Gary, the first and secnd winner as the most skilled member)

1829
01:13:44.786 --> 01:13:46.087
(Haha, the third winner as the most skilled member)

1830
01:13:46.152 --> 01:13:47.657
(Jae Seok and Kim Yeon Koung were the fourth winners.)

1831
01:13:47.733 --> 01:13:50.990
(And today, a fair game will reveal the new winner.)

1832
01:13:51.066 --> 01:13:53.141
(The final test will begin now.)

1833
01:13:54.646 --> 01:13:55.646
(A school in Sangam-dong)

1834
01:13:55.764 --> 01:13:56.904
This place is...

1835
01:13:57.979 --> 01:14:01.022
As Haha and Seok Jin have requested,

1836
01:14:01.635 --> 01:14:05.076
today will be a standardised game to pick the most skilled one.

1837
01:14:05.506 --> 01:14:06.688
So the final mission is called...

1838
01:14:06.903 --> 01:14:08.946
Standardised Name Tag Ripping.

1839
01:14:09.054 --> 01:14:10.344
(Today's final mission, Standardised Name Tag Ripping)

1840
01:14:10.452 --> 01:14:13.140
We have assessed the data for each of your strength,

1841
01:14:13.247 --> 01:14:16.688
nerve and name tag ripping rankings...

1842
01:14:16.763 --> 01:14:19.053
and standardised the game for you.

1843
01:14:19.161 --> 01:14:20.591
I'm really curious.

1844
01:14:20.666 --> 01:14:22.354
- If you look under this... - They standardised the game.

1845
01:14:22.419 --> 01:14:24.182
I wonder...

1846
01:14:24.504 --> 01:14:25.719
- Wow. - What is this?

1847
01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:27.730
Wow.

1848
01:14:27.795 --> 01:14:29.375
Look at the size of the name tags. It's nice.

1849
01:14:29.483 --> 01:14:30.665
This isn't right.

1850
01:14:30.773 --> 01:14:33.031
- This is great. - Why is Gary's name tag so small?

1851
01:14:33.138 --> 01:14:34.859
- My name tag... - Look at mine!

1852
01:14:34.966 --> 01:14:36.794
- Why is mine so big? - It's for children.

1853
01:14:37.117 --> 01:14:39.697
- Don't touch them please. - Why is Kwang Soo's so small?

1854
01:14:39.805 --> 01:14:41.923
The item related to the strength test...

1855
01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:45.933
- is the sandbag you see here. - Okay.

1856
01:14:46.299 --> 01:14:48.374
This isn't right, the name tag size is difficult to play with.

1857
01:14:48.449 --> 01:14:50.696
The size of the name tags are in correlation with the...

1858
01:14:50.772 --> 01:14:52.524
- your name tag ripping skills. - It has wings.

1859
01:14:54.212 --> 01:14:56.363
- This is great. - This name tag...

1860
01:14:56.761 --> 01:14:58.728
is going to get ripped off while he runs.

1861
01:14:58.836 --> 01:15:00.158
He'll be out soon.

1862
01:15:00.233 --> 01:15:01.524
- It'll be easy to rip it. - Goodness.

1863
01:15:01.631 --> 01:15:04.104
Just tell me that you don't want to send me to the UK.

1864
01:15:04.395 --> 01:15:06.222
Where do you have to rip? Is it here?

1865
01:15:06.502 --> 01:15:07.620
How do you rip this one?

1866
01:15:07.728 --> 01:15:09.373
How do you rip Seok Jin's name tag? Like this?

1867
01:15:09.835 --> 01:15:11.813
- Use your fingernails. - Just use your strength.

1868
01:15:11.878 --> 01:15:13.781
- Use your nails. - This is so small.

1869
01:15:13.856 --> 01:15:16.254
If you want to rip this, you have to knock him out first.

1870
01:15:17.437 --> 01:15:20.308
- Is that okay? - Also,

1871
01:15:20.985 --> 01:15:23.028
there are three sets of bells for Jong Kook,

1872
01:15:23.135 --> 01:15:25.286
Gary and Ji Hyo.

1873
01:15:25.393 --> 01:15:28.296
The top three rankings in nerve will be wearing bells.

1874
01:15:28.834 --> 01:15:31.382
- Are they attacking? - Kwang Soo is at advantage.

1875
01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:33.780
Seok Jin has only that name tag?

1876
01:15:33.887 --> 01:15:36.038
- He doesn't even have a sandbag. - Right. He has nothing.

1877
01:15:36.145 --> 01:15:38.403
(Seok Jin is the most benefited from standardisation.)

1878
01:15:38.511 --> 01:15:39.984
This is how life is.

1879
01:15:40.059 --> 01:15:42.059
This sandbag is going to affect me greatly.

1880
01:15:43.242 --> 01:15:47.005
Just know if you get hit by the sandbag, you could die.

1881
01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:48.403
- Why do you think like that? - Be careful.

1882
01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:50.015
- I'm telling the truth. - Don't say things like that.

1883
01:15:50.123 --> 01:15:51.660
- I don't know what will happen. - It didn't even happen yet.

1884
01:15:51.736 --> 01:15:54.037
Name tag or whatever, I won't leave you guys alone.

1885
01:15:54.101 --> 01:15:56.037
I'm so angry right now.

1886
01:15:57.112 --> 01:16:00.015
Jong Kook, you look like you're going to fly away any second now.

1887
01:16:00.090 --> 01:16:01.918
- You've ripped so many name tags. - But...

1888
01:16:02.025 --> 01:16:04.316
- that could be harder to rip. - It's really big.

1889
01:16:04.606 --> 01:16:05.928
You'll need both hands to rip that.

1890
01:16:06.036 --> 01:16:07.649
Jong Kook's going to fly away.

1891
01:16:07.756 --> 01:16:08.907
Ji Hyo,

1892
01:16:09.692 --> 01:16:11.950
I can see your name tag from the front.

1893
01:16:12.025 --> 01:16:13.487
Your name tag shows from the front.

1894
01:16:13.562 --> 01:16:16.035
Ji Hyo, you might end up floating in the air.

1895
01:16:16.788 --> 01:16:18.831
Be careful. You might rise like hot air.

1896
01:16:19.799 --> 01:16:21.411
This is hard for me.

1897
01:16:21.519 --> 01:16:23.024
(I can just do this.)

1898
01:16:23.745 --> 01:16:25.927
You put those under your armpits?

1899
01:16:27.368 --> 01:16:30.594
- You shouldn't do that! - Don't do that.

1900
01:16:30.658 --> 01:16:32.486
Why would you put those under your armpits?

1901
01:16:32.593 --> 01:16:34.099
Let's not do that.

1902
01:16:34.959 --> 01:16:36.572
This is too much.

1903
01:16:36.647 --> 01:16:38.722
Don't rip Seok Jin's name tag in advance.

1904
01:16:38.830 --> 01:16:40.873
Hey, what's wrong with you?

1905
01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:42.883
- He's provoking me. - Goodness.

1906
01:16:43.238 --> 01:16:44.528
Today's game is worth playing.

1907
01:16:44.958 --> 01:16:46.356
Seok Jin.

1908
01:16:47.109 --> 01:16:48.184
Is today the day?

1909
01:16:48.291 --> 01:16:49.582
(Is today the day?)

1910
01:16:49.829 --> 01:16:52.162
- Shall we be the last men standing? - Shall we?

1911
01:16:52.270 --> 01:16:53.775
- Okay - It's today.

1912
01:16:53.883 --> 01:16:55.893
- Today's the day. - I'll look forward to it.

1913
01:16:56.216 --> 01:16:58.474
- Seok Jin, you can't betray me. - I won't.

1914
01:16:58.581 --> 01:17:00.871
(Seok Jin has a mini name tag. Haha has a 1kg sandbag and a normal tag.)

1915
01:17:01.549 --> 01:17:03.237
(Show us your strength, Gary and Ji Hyo!)

1916
01:17:03.344 --> 01:17:05.065
(Gary: second in nerves, third in strength, fifth in name tag ranks)

1917
01:17:05.172 --> 01:17:06.860
(Ji Hyo: third in nerves, sixth in strength, second in name tag ranks)

1918
01:17:06.968 --> 01:17:09.580
(Gary: 1kg sandbag, bells and normal tag, Ji Hyo: bells and large tag)

1919
01:17:10.193 --> 01:17:11.838
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo will win using tricks and betraying.)

1920
01:17:11.946 --> 01:17:13.806
(Kwang Soo: fourth in nerves, third in strength, fifth in name tag rank)

1921
01:17:13.881 --> 01:17:15.526
(Jae Seok: seventh in nerves, second in strength, third in name tag rank)

1922
01:17:15.602 --> 01:17:18.290
(Kwang Soo: 1kg sandbag, normal tag, Jae Seok: 2kg sandbag, medium tag)

1923
01:17:19.150 --> 01:17:20.655
(The public enemy, Jong Kook)

1924
01:17:20.763 --> 01:17:24.279
(Jong Kook: first in nerves, first in strength, first in name tag rank)

1925
01:17:24.354 --> 01:17:26.967
(Jong Kook: 3kg sandbag, extra large winged tag and bells)

1926
01:17:27.106 --> 01:17:29.472
The Fifth Official Skill Assessment race...

1927
01:17:29.902 --> 01:17:31.730
will begin in five seconds.

1928
01:17:32.590 --> 01:17:34.235
Five,

1929
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:36.106
four,

1930
01:17:36.213 --> 01:17:37.966
three,

1931
01:17:38.073 --> 01:17:39.407
two,

1932
01:17:39.471 --> 01:17:41.084
one. Begin.

1933
01:17:42.406 --> 01:17:45.568
(The mission has begun.)

1934
01:17:45.675 --> 01:17:46.783
Should I hide somewhere?

1935
01:17:49.255 --> 01:17:52.266
Seok Jin has a chance to win today.

1936
01:17:52.804 --> 01:17:55.631
I tried to rip his name tag, but it didn't come off.

1937
01:17:55.707 --> 01:17:56.997
(Finding Seok Jin soon will be advantageous.)

1938
01:17:57.104 --> 01:17:58.287
I trust you, Seok Jin.

1939
01:17:59.147 --> 01:18:00.545
Today, I will make...

1940
01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:03.448
a mark in my life's history.

1941
01:18:04.416 --> 01:18:05.566
I will rip Jong Kook's name tag.

1942
01:18:05.674 --> 01:18:06.889
(I wil rip Jong Kook's name tag.)

1943
01:18:07.319 --> 01:18:09.147
The wings are too big.

1944
01:18:09.254 --> 01:18:10.297
(The extra large wings put him at a disadvantage.)

1945
01:18:10.405 --> 01:18:11.663
This is a problem.

1946
01:18:12.233 --> 01:18:13.340
I just have to listen carefully for the bells.

1947
01:18:15.383 --> 01:18:17.641
Why did I have to wear the bells?

1948
01:18:17.748 --> 01:18:19.361
They're so troublesome.

1949
01:18:20.974 --> 01:18:22.694
I can't do anything secretly.

1950
01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:25.920
Why do I have to run away?

1951
01:18:26.458 --> 01:18:29.038
Bells are for people who are chasing.

1952
01:18:30.436 --> 01:18:31.511
My arms.

1953
01:18:31.619 --> 01:18:33.554
(My arms)

1954
01:18:33.661 --> 01:18:37.102
Something keeps pulling my arms.

1955
01:18:38.285 --> 01:18:41.188
Goodness. I have to find Jong Kook.

1956
01:18:41.295 --> 01:18:43.801
(All skill levels have been standardised.)

1957
01:18:44.306 --> 01:18:46.241
If I don't win today,

1958
01:18:46.349 --> 01:18:47.854
I'll have no excuses.

1959
01:18:47.962 --> 01:18:49.037
(I'll have no excuses if I don't win today.)

1960
01:18:49.144 --> 01:18:50.220
(Laughing)

1961
01:18:51.295 --> 01:18:53.015
(The complete opposites, Jong Kook and Seok Jin...)

1962
01:18:53.123 --> 01:18:54.198
Jong Kook.

1963
01:18:54.305 --> 01:18:55.413
(They meet for the first time.)

1964
01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:57.671
Even if he has wings, you have to avoid him.

1965
01:18:57.746 --> 01:18:58.929
(The wings are tucked under his armpits.)

1966
01:18:59.757 --> 01:19:04.090
Now that the situation is like this, I don't feel the need to run away.

1967
01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:05.627
Gary?

1968
01:19:05.702 --> 01:19:08.530
(Jong Kook avoids Seok Jin for now.)

1969
01:19:09.143 --> 01:19:10.401
Jong Kook.

1970
01:19:11.401 --> 01:19:13.089
Seok Jin, you must be happy.

1971
01:19:13.734 --> 01:19:15.379
I'm confident to go one-on-one now.

1972
01:19:15.949 --> 01:19:18.530
I think today's possible winners are...

1973
01:19:18.605 --> 01:19:21.476
As today's possible winner, I will go to London.

1974
01:19:21.583 --> 01:19:23.089
Seok Jin and Kwang Soo.

1975
01:19:23.443 --> 01:19:24.551
Kwang Soo, let's go inside.

1976
01:19:24.626 --> 01:19:26.239
(Seok Jin attempts a joint attack with Kwang Soo.)

1977
01:19:26.346 --> 01:19:28.067
Let's not upset each other.

1978
01:19:28.174 --> 01:19:29.249
You have to promise.

1979
01:19:29.357 --> 01:19:30.432
I promise.

1980
01:19:30.970 --> 01:19:32.690
How did I end up next to Kwang Soo?

1981
01:19:32.798 --> 01:19:33.873
Trust me, Seok Jin.

1982
01:19:35.593 --> 01:19:39.141
He went inside. He's in the room.

1983
01:19:40.216 --> 01:19:41.399
There's no other choice.

1984
01:19:41.507 --> 01:19:42.689
(Let's move.)

1985
01:19:43.055 --> 01:19:46.775
Since we all have our disadvantages,

1986
01:19:47.528 --> 01:19:50.216
let's take care of the people who will cause trouble first.

1987
01:19:50.969 --> 01:19:52.151
I think you'll be the one causing trouble.

1988
01:19:52.904 --> 01:19:54.947
Look at him. He's so confident.

1989
01:19:55.484 --> 01:19:56.560
How about a one-on-one battle?

1990
01:19:56.667 --> 01:19:58.065
Wow, Seok Jin.

1991
01:19:58.172 --> 01:19:59.968
Are you really sure?

1992
01:20:00.076 --> 01:20:01.613
- Unbelievable. - Oh my goodness, Seok Jin!

1993
01:20:01.721 --> 01:20:05.559
- Jee Seok Jin! - Jee Seok Jin!

1994
01:20:05.634 --> 01:20:06.742
I can't believe Seok Jin...

1995
01:20:06.849 --> 01:20:08.064
- This is impressive. - One on one?

1996
01:20:08.387 --> 01:20:09.570
Really?

1997
01:20:09.677 --> 01:20:11.010
We really won't help you.

1998
01:20:11.075 --> 01:20:13.655
That was so impressive even if Seok Jin doesn't do anything.

1999
01:20:13.763 --> 01:20:15.376
I feel like Jong Kook right now.

2000
01:20:16.386 --> 01:20:18.461
- It doesn't matter who I'm against. - You can't rip his name tag.

2001
01:20:18.569 --> 01:20:20.859
- Do you want to go against me? - You really can't rip his name tag.

2002
01:20:20.967 --> 01:20:23.225
If anyone besides Jong Kook is willing to go against me, go ahead.

2003
01:20:23.332 --> 01:20:24.870
Hey, Kwang Soo...

2004
01:20:24.945 --> 01:20:26.848
It's over if one person grabs Seok Jin and another rips his tag.

2005
01:20:26.913 --> 01:20:28.310
That's cheating.

2006
01:20:28.386 --> 01:20:29.461
(That's cheating.)

2007
01:20:29.568 --> 01:20:30.644
That's not cheating.

2008
01:20:30.751 --> 01:20:32.471
Collaboration isn't cheating.

2009
01:20:32.579 --> 01:20:35.159
- During official skill assessments, - Why is that cheating?

2010
01:20:35.235 --> 01:20:36.880
you know we always get the people with advantages out first, right?

2011
01:20:36.987 --> 01:20:38.353
- Get Seok Jin out! - I know.

2012
01:20:38.568 --> 01:20:40.535
- Get Seok Jin out first. - He's trying to fool you.

2013
01:20:40.643 --> 01:20:42.008
Are you going to let him fool you?

2014
01:20:42.073 --> 01:20:43.266
You guys are humans.

2015
01:20:43.331 --> 01:20:44.944
- Or fight us, then. - What I mean is...

2016
01:20:45.051 --> 01:20:46.342
Fight us right now.

2017
01:20:46.557 --> 01:20:48.062
Come at us.

2018
01:20:49.352 --> 01:20:52.040
I feel like I'm going to lose. Jong Kook, are you confident?

2019
01:20:52.653 --> 01:20:54.975
Regardless of my confidence level, I'll fight if I have to.

2020
01:20:55.051 --> 01:20:56.771
- Wow. - What a man.

2021
01:20:56.846 --> 01:20:58.889
This is a real men's fight.

2022
01:20:59.029 --> 01:21:00.857
- This is awesome. - He's so charismatic.

2023
01:21:00.964 --> 01:21:04.190
This is a fight between one with and without advantages.

2024
01:21:04.297 --> 01:21:08.276
I don't know what'll happen, but the last one-on-one match will be fun.

2025
01:21:08.598 --> 01:21:09.749
I'm curious.

2026
01:21:09.856 --> 01:21:11.824
I want to stay by your side today.

2027
01:21:12.576 --> 01:21:13.834
I hope things go well.

2028
01:21:14.157 --> 01:21:16.372
Shall we go for it?

2029
01:21:16.447 --> 01:21:17.555
I will always root for you.

2030
01:21:18.458 --> 01:21:19.748
Okay, I was watching for you.

2031
01:21:20.103 --> 01:21:21.286
Hey, Jong Kook.

2032
01:21:22.683 --> 01:21:24.189
(Come and see me for a second.)

2033
01:21:24.296 --> 01:21:25.801
Hey! Jong Kook!

2034
01:21:26.339 --> 01:21:27.629
Come out. I see you.

2035
01:21:27.952 --> 01:21:29.565
- Jong Kook. - Come out here.

2036
01:21:29.672 --> 01:21:31.575
Jong Kook, he is my new boss.

2037
01:21:31.651 --> 01:21:32.823
(Seok Jin is my new boss.)

2038
01:21:32.898 --> 01:21:34.371
(Laughing)

2039
01:21:35.156 --> 01:21:38.274
- Jong Kook. - Come out here, Jong Kook.

2040
01:21:38.704 --> 01:21:40.317
Seok Jin is my new boss.

2041
01:21:40.424 --> 01:21:42.575
Why are you using formalities with Jong Kook?

2042
01:21:42.682 --> 01:21:43.757
I'm still...

2043
01:21:43.865 --> 01:21:44.940
- a bit uncomfortable with him. - He's still difficult?

2044
01:21:45.048 --> 01:21:46.338
- He's still older than you? - Yes, he is.

2045
01:21:46.553 --> 01:21:47.951
Hey, Jong Kook.

2046
01:21:48.456 --> 01:21:49.703
Seok Jin is our boss.

2047
01:21:50.424 --> 01:21:52.144
Hey, you.

2048
01:21:52.574 --> 01:21:53.757
Come here.

2049
01:21:54.402 --> 01:21:56.090
(Have patience)

2050
01:21:56.197 --> 01:21:57.380
- Jong Kook. - Seok Jin,

2051
01:21:57.488 --> 01:21:59.240
- if you call him, he won't come. - Right?

2052
01:22:00.563 --> 01:22:01.713
(Surprised)

2053
01:22:02.832 --> 01:22:05.982
(They're frightened by Jong Kook's small movement.)

2054
01:22:06.057 --> 01:22:08.165
I'm not ready yet.

2055
01:22:08.487 --> 01:22:09.992
My mentality isn't like Jong Kook's yet.

2056
01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:12.035
That was the scariest moment in the last five years.

2057
01:22:12.111 --> 01:22:13.971
He was always on my side.

2058
01:22:14.433 --> 01:22:15.551
I got scared.

2059
01:22:15.874 --> 01:22:17.196
- I was so scared. - That was so surprising.

2060
01:22:17.519 --> 01:22:18.809
What a surprise.

2061
01:22:20.099 --> 01:22:22.895
Haha and Seok Jin formed an alliance.

2062
01:22:22.970 --> 01:22:25.583
The two are running around together, saying they'll rip our name tags.

2063
01:22:26.013 --> 01:22:27.088
- Kwang Soo, - What?

2064
01:22:27.411 --> 01:22:28.991
if we keep going on like this,

2065
01:22:29.099 --> 01:22:30.712
- We're finished. - we're finished, Kwang Soo.

2066
01:22:31.281 --> 01:22:32.862
Jae Seok, trust me.

2067
01:22:32.937 --> 01:22:34.217
(We can only trust ourselves.)

2068
01:22:34.292 --> 01:22:37.163
- Should I really trust you? - Trust me this one time.

2069
01:22:37.625 --> 01:22:39.883
Jae Seok, I'll keep my promise today.

2070
01:22:39.991 --> 01:22:42.141
How do I earn your trust? I'm sincere.

2071
01:22:43.216 --> 01:22:44.936
Do I have to live like this my whole life?

2072
01:22:46.119 --> 01:22:47.840
- Jae Seok. - I think you do.

2073
01:22:47.947 --> 01:22:49.237
What are you talking about?

2074
01:22:49.452 --> 01:22:51.710
Jae Seok, it's 2016.

2075
01:22:53.828 --> 01:22:56.119
Okay, let's go then.

2076
01:22:56.441 --> 01:22:57.624
(Jae Seok decides to partner with Kwang Soo after much deliberation.)

2077
01:22:57.731 --> 01:22:58.914
Thank you, Jae Seok.

2078
01:22:59.022 --> 01:23:01.097
- Maybe you're planning to... - What?

2079
01:23:01.172 --> 01:23:02.677
- You wouldn't do that, right? - No way.

2080
01:23:02.785 --> 01:23:05.580
- You did this to me before. - I'm not that kind of person.

2081
01:23:06.333 --> 01:23:07.623
I wouldn't betray you.

2082
01:23:07.731 --> 01:23:09.591
Let's walk on both sides for now.

2083
01:23:09.666 --> 01:23:10.849
- I... - What?

2084
01:23:12.032 --> 01:23:14.827
- feel much better with a partner. - I agree. Me too.

2085
01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:17.193
Seok Jin has too much of an advantage.

2086
01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:19.558
(Gary tries to join Jae Seok and Kwang Soo's alliance.)

2087
01:23:20.418 --> 01:23:21.708
Hey!

2088
01:23:22.429 --> 01:23:23.644
- Jae Seok. - Yes?

2089
01:23:23.751 --> 01:23:25.149
- Did you form an alliance? - Speak comfortably.

2090
01:23:25.257 --> 01:23:27.837
- It's not an alliance. - You made an alliance, didn't you?

2091
01:23:27.945 --> 01:23:29.557
If you come up now, you will regret it.

2092
01:23:30.418 --> 01:23:31.600
Are they forming an alliance?

2093
01:23:31.708 --> 01:23:33.073
Is it an alliance?

2094
01:23:33.149 --> 01:23:34.503
- No, it's really not. - Tell us if it is.

2095
01:23:34.611 --> 01:23:35.794
I don't know who he is.

2096
01:23:35.901 --> 01:23:38.019
No, really. I don't know him.

2097
01:23:38.697 --> 01:23:40.492
- Just tell us. - It really isn't an alliance.

2098
01:23:42.137 --> 01:23:43.288
Are you guys in an alliance?

2099
01:23:43.675 --> 01:23:46.116
- I was always with Seok Jin. - No, but...

2100
01:23:46.223 --> 01:23:48.126
he's an assistant I always kept with me.

2101
01:23:48.201 --> 01:23:49.341
- I want to be Seok Jin's assistant. - Seok Jin...

2102
01:23:49.879 --> 01:23:51.427
Seok Jin, are you the boss here?

2103
01:23:51.492 --> 01:23:53.502
- I'm the boss. - He's the boss.

2104
01:23:53.610 --> 01:23:56.868
I just came back from giving Jong Kook a scare.

2105
01:23:56.975 --> 01:23:58.878
- Really? - Do you want to see?

2106
01:23:58.986 --> 01:24:00.201
Hey, Jong Kook!

2107
01:24:01.029 --> 01:24:02.964
What are you doing over there? Why aren't you coming out?

2108
01:24:06.975 --> 01:24:09.555
Are your hands cold? Why are your hands stuck under your armpits?

2109
01:24:10.415 --> 01:24:11.813
Goodness, we really have to...

2110
01:24:12.458 --> 01:24:15.146
Seok Jin, would you like to catch Gary right now?

2111
01:24:15.254 --> 01:24:16.436
Should we catch him right now?

2112
01:24:17.081 --> 01:24:18.802
Show us how it's done, Seok Jin.

2113
01:24:18.909 --> 01:24:20.060
Should I catch him?

2114
01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:21.350
- Let's go one-on-one. - Seok Jin.

2115
01:24:21.414 --> 01:24:22.888
- How about going one-on-one? - Seok Jin, wait.

2116
01:24:23.210 --> 01:24:24.468
(Seok Jin, why are you doing this to me?)

2117
01:24:24.576 --> 01:24:27.113
- How about a one-on-one? - I'll be more helpful.

2118
01:24:27.188 --> 01:24:29.414
- Seok Jin. - Later.

2119
01:24:29.522 --> 01:24:30.597
I am at your service.

2120
01:24:30.672 --> 01:24:32.779
Well it's true he betrays easily.

2121
01:24:32.887 --> 01:24:34.607
I'll be of great help to you.

2122
01:24:34.683 --> 01:24:36.758
It's hard to choose.

2123
01:24:36.833 --> 01:24:39.876
He moves around so freely.

2124
01:24:39.951 --> 01:24:41.058
Seok Jin.

2125
01:24:41.596 --> 01:24:45.037
Jong Kook, are you watching this?

2126
01:24:47.832 --> 01:24:50.628
I've been waiting for five years to pay him back.

2127
01:24:50.735 --> 01:24:52.208
(My time will come.)

2128
01:24:52.273 --> 01:24:54.714
I'm not going to cut you any slack from now on.

2129
01:24:54.821 --> 01:24:56.004
They're trying to form an alliance.

2130
01:24:56.111 --> 01:24:58.907
- Who is? - Kwang Soo called Gary.

2131
01:24:59.197 --> 01:25:00.702
Kwang Soo, come over here.

2132
01:25:00.778 --> 01:25:03.025
He called me here. Isn't that allowed?

2133
01:25:03.423 --> 01:25:06.218
- You're the boss here. - You're amazing.

2134
01:25:06.326 --> 01:25:07.971
This is unbelievable.

2135
01:25:08.046 --> 01:25:09.444
- Really. - Finally,

2136
01:25:09.551 --> 01:25:11.057
- my time has come. - This is unbelievable.

2137
01:25:11.164 --> 01:25:12.669
Seok Jin is the boss.

2138
01:25:12.777 --> 01:25:13.852
He's amazing.

2139
01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:15.465
Please have mercy.

2140
01:25:16.003 --> 01:25:17.830
(In your dreams)

2141
01:25:19.228 --> 01:25:20.841
(Kwang Soo has no choice but to run away.)

2142
01:25:20.949 --> 01:25:23.357
This is the life of a boss.

2143
01:25:23.744 --> 01:25:25.249
He ran away?

2144
01:25:25.572 --> 01:25:26.647
Haha, go that way.

2145
01:25:39.732 --> 01:25:41.485
(They missed the opportunity to catch Kwang Soo.)

2146
01:25:41.592 --> 01:25:42.883
I missed him.

2147
01:25:44.356 --> 01:25:45.463
This is nerve-wracking.

2148
01:25:46.323 --> 01:25:47.829
I shouldn't go around with Gary.

2149
01:25:47.904 --> 01:25:49.904
(Kwang Soo is next in line after Seok Jin.)

2150
01:25:49.979 --> 01:25:51.592
I need to survive this.

2151
01:25:51.699 --> 01:25:53.957
(Kwang Soo is next in line after Seok Jin.)

2152
01:25:54.570 --> 01:25:56.215
This is something.

2153
01:25:56.785 --> 01:25:58.505
(Kwang Soo has 1kg of sandbag and a normal sized name tag.)

2154
01:25:58.581 --> 01:25:59.871
Okay.

2155
01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:03.451
I need to get Kwang Soo.

2156
01:26:03.527 --> 01:26:05.967
(Seok Jin needs to get Kwang Soo out to win the game.)

2157
01:26:11.838 --> 01:26:13.096
Hey, you.

2158
01:26:14.386 --> 01:26:17.182
(Kwang Soo was waiting for ambush.)

2159
01:26:18.042 --> 01:26:19.117
Do you want to try?

2160
01:26:19.945 --> 01:26:22.493
I can't keep running away anymore.

2161
01:26:22.773 --> 01:26:25.031
(Seok Jin and Kwang Soo are the biggest beneficiaries today.)

2162
01:26:25.138 --> 01:26:27.364
Why is it me?

2163
01:26:27.504 --> 01:26:28.977
You started it.

2164
01:26:29.041 --> 01:26:30.084
(They are both eager to win.)

2165
01:26:30.192 --> 01:26:35.783
(Kwang Soo pulls Seok Jin's shirt.)

2166
01:26:39.868 --> 01:26:41.879
What are you going to do?

2167
01:26:44.277 --> 01:26:46.320
(I got you.)

2168
01:26:46.750 --> 01:26:49.115
What? You had your hand here?

2169
01:26:51.803 --> 01:26:54.491
(Ji Hyo finds the two.)

2170
01:26:56.824 --> 01:27:01.695
(Gary and Haha also come to the scene.)

2171
01:27:04.168 --> 01:27:06.243
Whose side are you on?

2172
01:27:06.318 --> 01:27:07.791
Hey!

2173
01:27:08.576 --> 01:27:10.727
(Who will Gary, Haha and Ji Hyo choose?)

2174
01:27:10.834 --> 01:27:12.845
Whose side are you on?

2175
01:27:12.952 --> 01:27:15.780
(Who will Gary, Haha and Ji Hyo choose?)

2176
01:27:15.888 --> 01:27:17.393
I nearly got Seok Jin's name tag.

2177
01:27:17.468 --> 01:27:20.189
I nearly got his name tag.

2178
01:27:20.264 --> 01:27:23.092
Seok Jin!

2179
01:27:24.059 --> 01:27:28.683
(Kwang Soo is out.)

2180
01:27:28.758 --> 01:27:31.371
I got him. Okay.

2181
01:27:31.478 --> 01:27:32.984
Look at him.

2182
01:27:33.091 --> 01:27:35.241
I'm so tired.

2183
01:27:35.317 --> 01:27:37.499
- Kwang Soo is out. - Goodness.

2184
01:27:37.575 --> 01:27:40.542
- Kwang Soo is out. - You must be really proud.

2185
01:27:40.617 --> 01:27:42.875
- Kwang Soo. - You must be.

2186
01:27:42.983 --> 01:27:44.703
I know exactly how to rip that name tag.

2187
01:27:44.811 --> 01:27:46.424
I nearly got him.

2188
01:27:46.531 --> 01:27:47.606
Kwang Soo.

2189
01:27:49.187 --> 01:27:50.832
This is tiring.

2190
01:27:56.746 --> 01:27:58.251
Kwang soo is out.

2191
01:27:59.939 --> 01:28:02.982
- Kwang soo is out. - It's begun.

2192
01:28:04.777 --> 01:28:06.422
Kwang Soo doesn't deserve to win.

2193
01:28:07.067 --> 01:28:08.756
I got out.

2194
01:28:09.540 --> 01:28:11.153
- This is a dangerous place. - Seok Jin,

2195
01:28:11.261 --> 01:28:13.304
when we appeared earlier, weren't you relieved to see us?

2196
01:28:13.411 --> 01:28:15.056
Yes.

2197
01:28:15.131 --> 01:28:17.465
- You need to protect us. - Let's go.

2198
01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:18.680
(I'll be sure to pay you back.)

2199
01:28:18.787 --> 01:28:21.077
Seok Jin, I helped out too.

2200
01:28:21.153 --> 01:28:24.163
- Because I came out from that side. - Yes. That's true.

2201
01:28:24.271 --> 01:28:25.991
I helped out too.

2202
01:28:26.099 --> 01:28:28.034
Let's move on to the next target.

2203
01:28:28.141 --> 01:28:30.399
- How about Jae Seok? - All right.

2204
01:28:30.442 --> 01:28:32.442
And when we go after him,

2205
01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:33.625
don't do a thing.

2206
01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:36.098
- All right. - We won't do anything.

2207
01:28:36.743 --> 01:28:38.356
I think I heard my name.

2208
01:28:41.291 --> 01:28:43.087
(How will I get out of this?)

2209
01:28:44.345 --> 01:28:45.420
What's that over there?

2210
01:28:45.495 --> 01:28:47.108
(They are looking for Jae Seok.)

2211
01:28:47.173 --> 01:28:48.785
Seok Jin,

2212
01:28:49.430 --> 01:28:50.613
act like you're after Jong Kook.

2213
01:28:51.764 --> 01:28:52.839
(Is he after Jong Kook?)

2214
01:28:52.946 --> 01:28:55.559
As if you're Jong Kook.

2215
01:28:56.527 --> 01:28:57.710
Seok Jin.

2216
01:28:58.677 --> 01:29:03.591
(They are quick to surround Jae Seok.)

2217
01:29:05.559 --> 01:29:08.752
(Seok Jin gets a hold on Jae Seok's name tag.)

2218
01:29:13.483 --> 01:29:14.730
(Jae Seok tries to escape.)

2219
01:29:14.805 --> 01:29:16.171
Fine.

2220
01:29:23.407 --> 01:29:24.514
(Haha falls over.)

2221
01:29:24.590 --> 01:29:25.665
Come quick.

2222
01:29:29.321 --> 01:29:31.041
(Jae Seok is out.)

2223
01:29:31.148 --> 01:29:32.439
- No way. - We did it.

2224
01:29:32.804 --> 01:29:33.944
Great.

2225
01:29:34.051 --> 01:29:35.557
Jae Seok is out.

2226
01:29:35.664 --> 01:29:37.600
- Jae Seok is out. - What is this?

2227
01:29:37.707 --> 01:29:38.815
(Jae Seok could not win against the tight alliance.)

2228
01:29:38.890 --> 01:29:41.040
That was good.

2229
01:29:41.406 --> 01:29:43.298
Everyone against me.

2230
01:29:43.406 --> 01:29:44.556
Goodness.

2231
01:29:49.319 --> 01:29:50.610
Jae Seok is out.

2232
01:29:51.222 --> 01:29:53.233
- See! - Jae Seok is out.

2233
01:29:54.588 --> 01:29:56.416
I told him.

2234
01:29:57.351 --> 01:29:58.566
Next is probably Jong Kook.

2235
01:29:58.674 --> 01:29:59.749
(Next is probably Jong Kook.)

2236
01:30:01.469 --> 01:30:03.802
When Seok Jin comes to get me,

2237
01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:05.447
my last resort is a one-on-one.

2238
01:30:05.555 --> 01:30:06.877
(Jong Kook aims to have a one-on-one fight.)

2239
01:30:06.953 --> 01:30:08.888
My last resort is a one-on-one.

2240
01:30:09.963 --> 01:30:11.899
I can go up against Jong Kook.

2241
01:30:12.006 --> 01:30:13.189
I can win against anyone.

2242
01:30:13.264 --> 01:30:14.619
(I'll be waiting.)

2243
01:30:14.802 --> 01:30:16.737
- Kwang Soo. - You're here.

2244
01:30:16.845 --> 01:30:18.135
- What are you doing? - Jae Seok.

2245
01:30:18.533 --> 01:30:20.500
I'm knitting this scarf.

2246
01:30:21.683 --> 01:30:23.403
Please sit down. You need to knit a scarf.

2247
01:30:23.511 --> 01:30:24.694
You want me to knit a scarf?

2248
01:30:24.801 --> 01:30:25.876
(A scarf?)

2249
01:30:25.984 --> 01:30:27.597
I've never knitted before.

2250
01:30:27.672 --> 01:30:29.317
This is really not my taste.

2251
01:30:29.392 --> 01:30:30.962
I'm really bad at this.

2252
01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:34.800
I have more important things to do.

2253
01:30:35.768 --> 01:30:36.983
I need to take my revenge.

2254
01:30:37.058 --> 01:30:38.886
What am I doing here?

2255
01:30:40.069 --> 01:30:41.219
How am I supposed to make this?

2256
01:30:41.897 --> 01:30:43.080
It's complicated.

2257
01:30:43.402 --> 01:30:44.907
Place this over here.

2258
01:30:45.015 --> 01:30:46.735
(Knitting class begins.)

2259
01:30:46.810 --> 01:30:47.886
Like this.

2260
01:30:48.778 --> 01:30:51.574
Then pull this. You're doing well.

2261
01:30:51.681 --> 01:30:52.756
Like this?

2262
01:30:52.971 --> 01:30:55.122
After that, pull the string.

2263
01:30:55.229 --> 01:30:56.337
This is only the beginning.

2264
01:30:56.412 --> 01:30:57.595
(This is only the beginning.)

2265
01:30:58.702 --> 01:30:59.853
Now,

2266
01:31:00.068 --> 01:31:02.293
Running Man is teaching us skills.

2267
01:31:03.293 --> 01:31:06.304
(They both lack enthusiasm.)

2268
01:31:06.734 --> 01:31:08.669
Didn't I look cool walking out of this door?

2269
01:31:08.777 --> 01:31:09.852
If it were some other day, it wouldn't have opened.

2270
01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:11.035
(The luck is on his side today.)

2271
01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:14.723
But today, the door opened easily.

2272
01:31:14.830 --> 01:31:17.024
It wasn't locked. It usually is locked though.

2273
01:31:17.099 --> 01:31:18.239
I know.

2274
01:31:18.346 --> 01:31:20.927
- This is my day. - It really is.

2275
01:31:22.002 --> 01:31:24.152
- Who's our next target? - It's Jong Kook.

2276
01:31:24.228 --> 01:31:25.260
(Everyone says it's Jong Kook.)

2277
01:31:25.335 --> 01:31:26.625
This is great.

2278
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:28.808
This spot is great.

2279
01:31:29.743 --> 01:31:31.249
- Jong Kook. - Yes.

2280
01:31:31.356 --> 01:31:33.399
Your turn is up.

2281
01:31:33.507 --> 01:31:35.152
I'm against four of you?

2282
01:31:35.259 --> 01:31:36.410
- What? - You four are together?

2283
01:31:36.485 --> 01:31:38.668
We said us four should be the last ones to survive.

2284
01:31:38.775 --> 01:31:39.850
(We're in the game alone.)

2285
01:31:41.538 --> 01:31:43.613
I'll go up against Seok Jin one-on-one.

2286
01:31:43.689 --> 01:31:45.592
All right.

2287
01:31:45.656 --> 01:31:47.914
- Isn't that all right? - You're amazing.

2288
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:49.893
Good luck, Seok Jin.

2289
01:31:49.957 --> 01:31:52.215
Now is the only time to make up for the past.

2290
01:31:52.290 --> 01:31:54.688
- You're really amazing. - You really are.

2291
01:31:54.796 --> 01:31:56.301
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2292
01:31:56.408 --> 01:31:58.236
- I have no choice. - Don't move.

2293
01:31:58.344 --> 01:32:00.172
- You can't help. - We won't.

2294
01:32:00.279 --> 01:32:01.677
- Don't help. - Okay.

2295
01:32:01.784 --> 01:32:03.182
Even if I fail,

2296
01:32:03.290 --> 01:32:05.333
- I'll go down on my own. - Okay. I'll stay put right here.

2297
01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:07.300
I want to do this on my own.

2298
01:32:07.375 --> 01:32:08.526
Okay.

2299
01:32:08.633 --> 01:32:09.881
(Both players move to the battleground.)

2300
01:32:10.171 --> 01:32:14.149
- Go, Seok Jin. - Go, Seok Jin.

2301
01:32:14.257 --> 01:32:16.515
- This is best. - It's now or later.

2302
01:32:16.622 --> 01:32:18.450
(Jong Kook needs to be eliminated now or later.)

2303
01:32:20.493 --> 01:32:22.213
Seok Jin.

2304
01:32:22.289 --> 01:32:24.073
(I will win.)

2305
01:32:24.149 --> 01:32:26.622
This is impossible.

2306
01:32:26.729 --> 01:32:27.987
(They started off with complete opposite name tags.)

2307
01:32:28.062 --> 01:32:30.170
You're going to be blown away.

2308
01:32:30.277 --> 01:32:31.460
Hey.

2309
01:32:31.890 --> 01:32:34.471
Let's get rid of the strongest person first.

2310
01:32:34.578 --> 01:32:35.653
I think that's you.

2311
01:32:36.083 --> 01:32:37.126
Hey, Jong Kook.

2312
01:32:37.234 --> 01:32:38.341
(Will Seok Jin surprise us?)

2313
01:32:38.417 --> 01:32:40.169
What are you doing there?

2314
01:32:40.814 --> 01:32:43.287
Are your hands cold? Why do you have them under your armpits?

2315
01:32:44.255 --> 01:32:46.083
- Look at him. - He's the man.

2316
01:32:46.190 --> 01:32:48.341
This is quite something.

2317
01:32:48.448 --> 01:32:50.276
We look forward to your fight.

2318
01:32:50.384 --> 01:32:51.566
(Jong Kook has strength, I have a mini name tag.)

2319
01:32:51.674 --> 01:32:53.824
(We are on a level field.)

2320
01:32:56.512 --> 01:33:00.318
You only need to touch it.

2321
01:33:01.351 --> 01:33:05.867
(Jong Kook's enormous name tag is his weakness.)

2322
01:33:07.447 --> 01:33:08.555
What's happening?

2323
01:33:09.307 --> 01:33:10.490
(Seok Jin grabs Jong Kook's name tag.)

2324
01:33:11.318 --> 01:33:13.361
(Is this for real?)

2325
01:33:14.038 --> 01:33:15.189
What's happening?

2326
01:33:15.296 --> 01:33:16.511
(Seok Jin gets a hold of Jong Kook's name tag.)

2327
01:33:16.619 --> 01:33:19.167
What's happening?

2328
01:33:20.167 --> 01:33:27.048
(Will Seok Jin be able to win?)

2329
01:33:30.424 --> 01:33:33.284
(I've been the weakling for the past six years.)

2330
01:33:33.392 --> 01:33:37.262
(I will pay back for all that.)

2331
01:33:38.338 --> 01:33:42.101
(Which will it be? Jong Kook's strength or Seok Jin's advantage?)

2332
01:33:42.208 --> 01:33:46.724
(Who will be the winner?)

2333
01:33:49.703 --> 01:33:50.918
(He rips the name tag off.)

2334
01:33:53.283 --> 01:33:56.154
(Seok Jin rips Jong Kook's name tag off.)

2335
01:33:56.218 --> 01:33:57.369
(Goodness.)

2336
01:33:59.304 --> 01:34:00.455
Everyone,

2337
01:34:00.702 --> 01:34:01.809
I win.

2338
01:34:01.885 --> 01:34:03.573
(I did it.)

2339
01:34:04.433 --> 01:34:07.261
Everyone, I did it.

2340
01:34:07.691 --> 01:34:09.089
Thanks to the wings.

2341
01:34:09.196 --> 01:34:12.239
(Seok Jin won against Jong Kook.)

2342
01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:17.475
- Jong Kook, goodbye. - Bye.

2343
01:34:17.550 --> 01:34:18.626
Jong Kook is out.

2344
01:34:18.733 --> 01:34:20.271
(Jong Kook is out.)

2345
01:34:20.378 --> 01:34:22.529
- Jong Kook is out. - Let's go.

2346
01:34:24.571 --> 01:34:27.582
- This looks like a champion's belt. - It does.

2347
01:34:28.517 --> 01:34:31.990
You should take a photo.

2348
01:34:32.388 --> 01:34:33.496
- Should I? - Yes.

2349
01:34:33.571 --> 01:34:37.076
(Let's remember this day forever.)

2350
01:34:38.044 --> 01:34:39.194
(Haha and Seok Jin promised not to betray each other today.)

2351
01:34:39.269 --> 01:34:40.915
Seok Jin, is it today?

2352
01:34:41.452 --> 01:34:42.990
Should we be the last ones standing?

2353
01:34:43.065 --> 01:34:44.678
Let's cooperate today.

2354
01:34:44.785 --> 01:34:47.581
(Now is the time.)

2355
01:34:48.516 --> 01:34:50.194
- Let's take a photo. - Come here.

2356
01:34:50.269 --> 01:34:54.322
(Everyone joins to commemorate the day.)

2357
01:34:54.387 --> 01:34:55.537
Let's go with this.

2358
01:34:55.752 --> 01:34:57.365
- Is it this? - No, look at that.

2359
01:34:58.655 --> 01:35:00.376
One, two, three.

2360
01:35:02.956 --> 01:35:04.246
(What are you doing?)

2361
01:35:04.354 --> 01:35:05.429
Hey.

2362
01:35:06.827 --> 01:35:09.977
(Haha betrays Seok Jin.)

2363
01:35:13.418 --> 01:35:15.353
Seok Jin only has a name tag?

2364
01:35:15.461 --> 01:35:16.934
- He has nothing. - That's how it is.

2365
01:35:17.041 --> 01:35:18.471
That's just how life is.

2366
01:35:18.579 --> 01:35:20.192
I will go to London.

2367
01:35:20.299 --> 01:35:21.525
(He worked hard to protect his name tag until now.)

2368
01:35:21.633 --> 01:35:23.493
Come here, Jong Kook.

2369
01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:29.266
(I can't lose like this!)

2370
01:35:32.449 --> 01:35:34.384
I knew this would happen!

2371
01:35:35.997 --> 01:35:37.395
- Give it to me. - I...

2372
01:35:37.503 --> 01:35:39.653
- knew this would happen. - Grab it.

2373
01:35:40.191 --> 01:35:41.481
(Ripping)

2374
01:35:41.588 --> 01:35:43.201
Hold him.

2375
01:35:43.814 --> 01:35:45.459
- You guys! - It's over.

2376
01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:49.975
(I can't believe I trusted them.)

2377
01:35:50.771 --> 01:35:52.018
You guys, I can't believe this.

2378
01:35:53.523 --> 01:35:58.146
(Seok Jin had hoped to win in the standardised game.)

2379
01:35:58.222 --> 01:35:59.437
It's supposed to be today!

2380
01:36:01.372 --> 01:36:06.103
(Getting caught off guard always brings anger.)

2381
01:36:08.146 --> 01:36:09.221
(Gary and Haha's strategy)

2382
01:36:09.329 --> 01:36:11.662
Make him rip Jong Kook's name tag.

2383
01:36:11.769 --> 01:36:13.522
And then you, me...

2384
01:36:13.952 --> 01:36:16.855
and Ji Hyo can rip Seok Jin's name tag.

2385
01:36:17.715 --> 01:36:19.435
Then we fight amongst ourselves.

2386
01:36:19.543 --> 01:36:20.618
(Seok Jin was just a bait to catch Jong Kook.)

2387
01:36:21.156 --> 01:36:22.339
Oh my.

2388
01:36:23.844 --> 01:36:25.779
How am I going to face the other members?

2389
01:36:27.112 --> 01:36:28.575
(His face is getting hot.)

2390
01:36:28.682 --> 01:36:30.403
How will I face them now?

2391
01:36:30.618 --> 01:36:31.908
This is so funny. My stomach hurts.

2392
01:36:32.015 --> 01:36:33.951
Oh my goodness.

2393
01:36:35.026 --> 01:36:38.359
(Today was a good chance for a life-changing win.)

2394
01:36:38.467 --> 01:36:41.198
Let's get rid of the people who will cause trouble first.

2395
01:36:41.262 --> 01:36:42.660
I think that's you.

2396
01:36:42.767 --> 01:36:44.058
You, come here.

2397
01:36:44.165 --> 01:36:45.240
(Times when he had all the powers)

2398
01:36:45.391 --> 01:36:47.391
I can take on anyone right now.

2399
01:36:47.466 --> 01:36:49.219
Seok Jin, are you the boss here?

2400
01:36:49.326 --> 01:36:50.982
He's the boss here.

2401
01:36:51.046 --> 01:36:53.025
- Seok Jin! - He's really fooling around.

2402
01:36:53.132 --> 01:36:54.487
Jong Kook, are you watching?

2403
01:36:54.595 --> 01:36:56.283
(It is all useless now.)

2404
01:36:57.283 --> 01:37:00.659
- This is so funny. - My stomach hurts.

2405
01:37:06.067 --> 01:37:07.572
We should all know by now...

2406
01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:09.002
that there is no lasting friendship.

2407
01:37:09.325 --> 01:37:10.400
And no lasting rivalry.

2408
01:37:10.508 --> 01:37:11.905
But Ji Hyo, what I think...

2409
01:37:12.013 --> 01:37:13.561
is that you and I work well together.

2410
01:37:15.131 --> 01:37:17.496
- And Gary has gotten uglier. - Ji Hyo, think carefully.

2411
01:37:17.819 --> 01:37:18.894
Think carefully.

2412
01:37:19.002 --> 01:37:20.507
Think carefully.

2413
01:37:20.615 --> 01:37:22.335
Ji Hyo, watch. Look at this.

2414
01:37:22.442 --> 01:37:23.840
If Gary and I attack you...

2415
01:37:24.593 --> 01:37:25.668
What's this?

2416
01:37:26.743 --> 01:37:27.818
- Gary... - Ji Hyo.

2417
01:37:28.001 --> 01:37:28.894
this is a nice combination, too.

2418
01:37:29.001 --> 01:37:30.184
(This is a nice combination, too.)

2419
01:37:30.936 --> 01:37:32.807
- Then let's all fight at once! - Okay.

2420
01:37:32.872 --> 01:37:34.162
- Let's go. - Okay.

2421
01:37:34.270 --> 01:37:35.345
Let's come together.

2422
01:37:35.452 --> 01:37:37.355
(Gary has a sandbag, a bell and a normal tag. Haha has a sandbag...)

2423
01:37:37.431 --> 01:37:39.506
(and a normal tag. Ji Hyo has a large tag.)

2424
01:37:40.721 --> 01:37:43.731
- Ji Hyo come here. - What are you doing?

2425
01:37:43.839 --> 01:37:44.914
Hey, still.

2426
01:37:50.613 --> 01:37:52.548
- What are you doing? - Still, you know what I mean.

2427
01:37:53.193 --> 01:37:55.387
Okay, I'll do it. I'll rip it myself.

2428
01:37:55.451 --> 01:37:56.849
- You have to rip his name tag! - I'll do it.

2429
01:37:56.956 --> 01:37:58.214
- I'll rip it myself. - You have to rip his tag!

2430
01:38:01.150 --> 01:38:04.881
(The Gary and Ji Hyo couple go in for a joint attack.)

2431
01:38:06.741 --> 01:38:09.106
(Haha defends his name tag by lying on the floor.)

2432
01:38:11.407 --> 01:38:13.407
You can't rip Ji Hyo's name tag.

2433
01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:17.063
(You can't rip Ji Hyo's name tag.)

2434
01:38:18.676 --> 01:38:20.718
(Haha suddenly changes position for a come back.)

2435
01:38:22.514 --> 01:38:24.052
(Ripping)

2436
01:38:26.740 --> 01:38:28.643
Ji Hyo, you should have ripped Haha's tag first.

2437
01:38:28.825 --> 01:38:30.653
I tried to grab Haha's tag,

2438
01:38:30.761 --> 01:38:32.911
but Haha elbowed me in my thighs.

2439
01:38:33.019 --> 01:38:34.266
Come on, Ji Hyo.

2440
01:38:34.879 --> 01:38:36.137
Goodness, my thighs hurt.

2441
01:38:36.201 --> 01:38:37.492
Gary is out.

2442
01:38:38.427 --> 01:38:39.857
Gary is out.

2443
01:38:39.965 --> 01:38:41.040
I'm done.

2444
01:38:49.964 --> 01:38:52.157
- Haha or Ji Hyo will probably win. - You're right.

2445
01:38:52.265 --> 01:38:55.738
Oh man, I was used by Haha.

2446
01:38:56.845 --> 01:38:58.673
Wait, that hurts. Hold on.

2447
01:39:00.393 --> 01:39:01.942
I'm pretty good at this.

2448
01:39:02.436 --> 01:39:04.264
It's really nice.

2449
01:39:04.372 --> 01:39:05.769
I'm good at knitting.

2450
01:39:06.243 --> 01:39:07.382
You're really good at knitting.

2451
01:39:07.458 --> 01:39:09.103
Right? I'm talented.

2452
01:39:09.576 --> 01:39:11.328
You should open a knitting store.

2453
01:39:11.436 --> 01:39:12.511
Right?

2454
01:39:12.801 --> 01:39:15.769
- Jong Kook, you're very good. - I'll go shirtless for the poster.

2455
01:39:15.844 --> 01:39:17.704
That's a great idea.

2456
01:39:17.812 --> 01:39:20.360
Stay inside all day...

2457
01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:22.113
while wearing a tank top.

2458
01:39:22.295 --> 01:39:23.618
Sit here and knit if you want.

2459
01:39:23.725 --> 01:39:25.123
(Jong Kook's Knitting School)

2460
01:39:26.091 --> 01:39:28.456
I'm really good at this.

2461
01:39:28.564 --> 01:39:29.822
You have talent.

2462
01:39:29.962 --> 01:39:32.187
This is nice. You look very innocent.

2463
01:39:32.434 --> 01:39:34.875
Stop lifting barbells and just do this.

2464
01:39:34.983 --> 01:39:36.090
I have to put it in here again, right?

2465
01:39:36.198 --> 01:39:38.348
This is the beginning of Jong Kook's new life.

2466
01:39:38.456 --> 01:39:40.068
- Put it here... - I support you.

2467
01:39:40.176 --> 01:39:41.896
Jong Kook found his niche.

2468
01:39:42.004 --> 01:39:43.875
But really, old attachments are scary.

2469
01:39:43.982 --> 01:39:46.993
In that moment, how could you..

2470
01:39:47.100 --> 01:39:48.563
go on Gary's side like that?

2471
01:39:48.670 --> 01:39:50.036
I wasn't on his side.

2472
01:39:51.036 --> 01:39:53.186
How was that not taking his side?

2473
01:39:53.293 --> 01:39:55.304
- What do you mean? - Hold on.

2474
01:39:55.551 --> 01:39:58.347
- Aren't you being harsh? - Are you fighting me now?

2475
01:39:58.530 --> 01:39:59.895
(There is only one open spot for the fifth most skilled member.)

2476
01:40:00.003 --> 01:40:01.250
What are you doing?

2477
01:40:01.325 --> 01:40:04.798
What are you doing Do you think I'll fall for that again?

2478
01:40:05.981 --> 01:40:07.637
This is someone who will help you.

2479
01:40:07.701 --> 01:40:10.647
Things were always good when I partnered with him.

2480
01:40:10.755 --> 01:40:13.045
- That's Haha. - Wow.

2481
01:40:13.185 --> 01:40:15.303
- We won many times. - Whenever I partnered with Haha...

2482
01:40:17.131 --> 01:40:24.732
(They were always lucky and happy together.)

2483
01:40:25.227 --> 01:40:26.840
Are you in your right mind?

2484
01:40:27.807 --> 01:40:29.033
It's Ji Hyo.

2485
01:40:29.141 --> 01:40:31.356
Whenever we were partners, the result was always good.

2486
01:40:31.463 --> 01:40:33.183
(We used to be so good together.)

2487
01:40:35.119 --> 01:40:37.807
(Now they must collide for the one spot of most skilled member.)

2488
01:40:37.882 --> 01:40:39.785
You won this game before.

2489
01:40:39.925 --> 01:40:41.785
So you should give up and let me rip your name tag.

2490
01:40:43.258 --> 01:40:45.871
I'm too upset to let you rip my tag so easily.

2491
01:40:45.978 --> 01:40:47.591
What do you mean?

2492
01:40:48.021 --> 01:40:50.430
You're the one who took all the prize gold.

2493
01:40:50.537 --> 01:40:51.720
Ji Hyo.

2494
01:40:51.828 --> 01:40:53.290
(I can't give up like this!)

2495
01:40:53.795 --> 01:40:54.978
Why are you so strong?

2496
01:40:55.333 --> 01:40:57.773
She's so strong.

2497
01:40:59.634 --> 01:41:01.289
Look, she's bending my arm.

2498
01:41:32.072 --> 01:41:33.148
Oh my goodness.

2499
01:41:34.094 --> 01:41:36.750
(Haha attempts to rip Ji Hyo's tag with his teeth.)

2500
01:41:36.750 --> 01:41:38.642
You've never seen this method, have you?

2501
01:41:38.642 --> 01:41:40.534
You can't use your teeth like that!

2502
01:41:40.685 --> 01:41:41.738
(Haha is targeting Ji Hyo's oversized name tag.)

2503
01:41:41.738 --> 01:41:42.921
It's a first for me, too.

2504
01:41:43.179 --> 01:41:44.857
My hair is stuck on my name tag!

2505
01:41:44.964 --> 01:41:46.039
(My hair is stuck on my name tag!)

2506
01:41:46.147 --> 01:41:47.480
My hair is stuck!

2507
01:41:47.588 --> 01:41:50.018
Wait, my hair!

2508
01:41:50.125 --> 01:41:51.308
(My hair!)

2509
01:41:51.630 --> 01:41:52.813
(She can't even ask Haha to take her hair off.)

2510
01:41:52.888 --> 01:41:53.964
I'll take it off for you.

2511
01:41:54.318 --> 01:41:55.394
- I'll take it off for you. - My hair.

2512
01:41:55.501 --> 01:41:57.436
- My hair is stuck. - I'll take it off for you.

2513
01:41:57.544 --> 01:41:58.619
(Wait, I'll take it off for you.)

2514
01:41:58.727 --> 01:41:59.909
(Ripping)

2515
01:42:02.167 --> 01:42:04.608
Why is the name tag so big?

2516
01:42:04.748 --> 01:42:09.371
(Thanks to a large name tag with strong adhesion, Ji Hyo is out.)

2517
01:42:10.554 --> 01:42:13.134
Okay, let's go.

2518
01:42:15.715 --> 01:42:20.231
(Haha is the fifth most skilled member)

2519
01:42:20.553 --> 01:42:21.887
I was supposed to win today.

2520
01:42:21.994 --> 01:42:23.241
Did Haha win?

2521
01:42:23.349 --> 01:42:25.005
Haha, you are...

2522
01:42:25.112 --> 01:42:27.542
(I won!)

2523
01:42:28.725 --> 01:42:30.628
I can't believe this.

2524
01:42:30.875 --> 01:42:32.746
I will never trust you again.

2525
01:42:32.811 --> 01:42:34.531
Honestly, the most upset person here is Seok Jin.

2526
01:42:34.638 --> 01:42:35.972
Of course.

2527
01:42:36.036 --> 01:42:37.649
(I lost a golden opportunity because they betrayed me.)

2528
01:42:37.757 --> 01:42:39.907
- It was his chance to win. - It really was.

2529
01:42:40.015 --> 01:42:41.810
The fifth most skilled member...

2530
01:42:41.918 --> 01:42:43.498
is Haha.

2531
01:42:43.563 --> 01:42:45.175
- Thank you. - Congratulations.

2532
01:42:45.283 --> 01:42:47.691
I give the honour of this victory to Seok Jin.

2533
01:42:47.799 --> 01:42:49.584
None of this would have happened if not for Seok Jin.

2534
01:42:49.691 --> 01:42:51.132
Okay, we get it. Just take it.

2535
01:42:51.272 --> 01:42:52.379
Just take it.

2536
01:42:53.670 --> 01:42:54.928
Take this, please.

2537
01:42:55.712 --> 01:42:57.110
Make it a one night stay.

2538
01:42:57.970 --> 01:42:59.411
Haha you should go...

2539
01:42:59.519 --> 01:43:00.701
with your wife.

2540
01:43:00.766 --> 01:43:02.164
Make it your second honeymoon.

2541
01:43:03.884 --> 01:43:08.937
(This is why you shouldn't easily trust anyone.)

2542
01:43:10.980 --> 01:43:12.131
A mountain cabin invitation?

2543
01:43:13.314 --> 01:43:14.421
What is this?

2544
01:43:14.496 --> 01:43:15.787
It's a real party.

2545
01:43:16.356 --> 01:43:17.969
I'm the owner of this mountain cabin.

2546
01:43:18.077 --> 01:43:20.163
(The cabin owner's diamond necklace disappeared?)

2547
01:43:20.227 --> 01:43:22.593
My necklace disappeared, what do I do?

2548
01:43:22.775 --> 01:43:23.775
The diamond necklace?

2549
01:43:24.635 --> 01:43:26.399
Someone is collapsed in here.

2550
01:43:26.506 --> 01:43:27.969
It's a ghost murder case.

2551
01:43:28.614 --> 01:43:29.732
This is exclusive news.

2552
01:43:30.700 --> 01:43:31.775
This is the day.

2553
01:43:31.839 --> 01:43:33.527
The criminal is...

2554
01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:34.710
amongst us.

2555
01:43:35.710 --> 01:43:37.323
So is that why you stole the necklace?

2556
01:43:37.398 --> 01:43:39.258
(Solve the mysterious case and escape the mountain cabin)

2557
01:43:39.333 --> 01:43:40.871
The criminal is you.

2558
01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.344
