1
00:00:02,486 --> 00:00:04,738
非常感谢，两位的酒马上就来
Thank you very much, I'II be
right back with your drinks.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,740
- 好的，谢谢
- 好的
- Okay, thanks.
- Okay.

3
00:00:10,661 --> 00:00:12,579
你刚才说什么来着？
So what were you saying?

4
00:00:12,621 --> 00:00:15,874
哦，没什么。
杰弗里拿了迈克尔的帽子，
Oh, nothing.
Geoffrey took MichaeI's hat,

5
00:00:15,874 --> 00:00:18,585
然后杰弗里又在学校，
所以迈克尔没帽子了
and Geoffrey's was at schooI,
so MichaeI didn't have a hat.

6
00:00:18,627 --> 00:00:22,506
不过他也不在乎，
因为反正他也讨厌帽子
But he didn't care 'cause
he hates hats anyways.

7
00:00:22,548 --> 00:00:24,508
哼
Hmm.

8
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:51,744
- 这么说杰弗里拿了迈克尔的帽子
- 是的
- So Geoffrey took MichaeI's hat?
- Yeah.

9
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,756
面包不错
This bread is good.

10
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,216
这点说得对
You got that right.

11
00:01:06,258 --> 00:01:09,052
不过，咱们也许不要先让面包填饱了
AIthough, we probabIy shouIdn't
fiII up on bread though.

12
00:01:09,052 --> 00:01:11,305
是的，说得对
Yeah, you're right.

13
00:01:35,788 --> 00:01:37,748
面包实在不错，不过。
非常好
The bread is good, though.
It is good.

14
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,250
奶油也好。感觉像蜂蜜奶油之类的
The butter's good, too. It's Iike
honey butter or something.

15
00:01:40,292 --> 00:01:41,668
是的
Yeah.

16
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,838
蜂蜜，哼
Honey, hmm.

17
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:50,594
让我想起罗伯特意外吞掉只蜜蜂
That reminds me of when Robert
accidentaIIy swaIIowed the bee.

18
00:01:50,636 --> 00:01:54,515
你真该看看他的样子。
就像是……
You shouId have
seen him. He was Iike...

19
00:01:54,556 --> 00:01:56,475
- 是的
- 滑稽死了
- Yeah.
- It was funny.

20
00:01:56,517 --> 00:02:00,145
是的。是的，我喜欢那故事
Yeah. Yeah, I Iove that story.

21
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,498
这奶油还很好涂
The butter
spreads good, too.

22
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:23,710
是的，我不喜欢凝固得太厉害的
Yeah, I hate it
when it's too frozen,

23
00:02:23,752 --> 00:02:25,712
你知道，涂得连面包都弄破了
you know, 'cause
it tears the bread.

24
00:02:25,754 --> 00:02:27,673
是的，不过你也不想太软了
Yeah, aIthough you
don't want it too soft,

25
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:30,968
因为那样你就不知道
是什么时候的了
'cause then you don't know
how Iong it's been out.

26
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:33,887
是的。
不，这奶油好极了
Yeah.
No, this butter's perfect.

27
00:02:35,097 --> 00:02:38,642
就像是完美的……
怎么说呢？
It's Iike the perfect...
what's the word?

28
00:02:39,768 --> 00:02:41,437
温度
Temperature.

29
00:02:41,478 --> 00:02:43,897
不
No.

30
00:02:49,153 --> 00:02:52,781
密度。
完美的密度，是的
Density.
The perfect density, yeah.

31
00:02:54,366 --> 00:02:56,410
不过，是的，温度也说得过去
AIthough, yeah, temperature
wouId have worked.

32
00:02:56,452 --> 00:03:00,706
这奶油代表了完美的
温度-撕拉-密度
This butter is the perfect
temperature-sIash-density.

33
00:03:02,374 --> 00:03:04,293
是的，没错
Yes, it is.

34
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:16,513
- 我们需要更多面包
- 是的
- We need more bread.
- Yeah.

35
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:23,445
现在到我情人节
And now my favorite part

36
00:03:23,487 --> 00:03:25,322
最喜欢的部分了
of VaIentine's Day.

37
00:03:25,364 --> 00:03:26,448
什么？
What?

38
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:30,286
红丝裤拳手进行曲
The march of the red,
siIk boxers.

39
00:03:38,544 --> 00:03:41,964
- 你开玩笑呢？
- 你说得对。舞可以跳过去
- Are you kidding me?
- You're right. Skip the dancing.

40
00:03:42,006 --> 00:03:43,549
等一等
Wait a minute.

41
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:46,427
一晚上都没话说，
你现在只想上床？
We don't taIk to each other aII night
now you just wanna have sex?

42
00:03:46,468 --> 00:03:48,929
不是只
Not just.

43
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:50,890
嘿，别这样。
咱们说话了
Hey, come on.
We taIked.

44
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,725
哦，是的，是的
Oh, yeah, yeah.

45
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,561
“这奶油代表了完美的
温度-撕拉-密度”
''This butter is the perfect
temperature-sIash-density.''

46
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:59,273
我说的不对吗？
Was I wrong?

47
00:03:59,315 --> 00:04:02,276
你知道吗？
咱们都没话对对方说了
You know what? We have
nothing to say to each other.

48
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:04,737
说的全是孩子，
AII we do is taIk
about the kids,

49
00:04:04,737 --> 00:04:08,365
要不就是听了
一遍一遍又一遍的故事
or teII stories we've heard
over and over and over.

50
00:04:08,407 --> 00:04:11,535
- 什么故事？
- 罗伯特吞那只该死的蜜蜂
- What stories?
- Robert swaIIowing that damn bee.

51
00:04:11,535 --> 00:04:14,413
这蠢故事我都听了一百万遍了，
I've heard that stupid
story a miIIion times,

52
00:04:14,413 --> 00:04:16,457
只要你看到蜂蜜或者蜜蜂
every time you see
honey or a bee

53
00:04:16,498 --> 00:04:19,001
或者脸肿了的人
or a person
with a puffy face.

54
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:23,422
是啊，那有一百万遍
Yeah, that's a miIIion.

55
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:25,799
或者露营的时候你爸
在你帐篷里放只负鼠，
Or how about the time your dad
put a possum in your tent

56
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:29,970
你真的体不附皮了？
during a camping trip and you
IiteraIIy jumped out of your skin?

57
00:04:30,012 --> 00:04:32,514
- 什么？真的很吓人
- 是的，那不是真的
- What? It was scary.
- Yeah, that's not IiteraIIy.

58
00:04:32,556 --> 00:04:34,516
真的体不附皮的话，
你就死了
You IiteraIIy jump out
of your skin, you're dead.

59
00:04:34,558 --> 00:04:37,937
身体出皮，死人
Body out of skin, dead.

60
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:40,356
那你呢？你老跟我讲那个故事
How about you? You're aIways
teIIing me about the story

61
00:04:40,397 --> 00:04:43,025
你穿紫鞋，然后脚出汗，
where you wore purpIe shoes
and your feet sweated,

62
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:45,945
结果也变成紫的。
“好像我是做酒的”
and they turned purpIe.
''It was Iike I was making wine.''

63
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:48,405
这可没什么劲
That's not funny.

64
00:04:48,447 --> 00:04:50,533
我知道。看到了？
I know. See?

65
00:04:50,574 --> 00:04:54,036
咱们都没话可说了，
而你甚至都不在乎
We have nothing to taIk about
and you don't even care.

66
00:04:54,078 --> 00:04:56,497
唔，咱们现在就在说呢。
这很好
WeII, we're taIking now.
This is great.

67
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:59,833
好吧，对不起
AII right, I'm sorry.

68
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,961
不，别道歉。
我不是生你的气
No, don't apoIogize.
I'm not mad at you.

69
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:04,046
我是生咱们俩的气
I'm mad at us.

70
00:05:04,088 --> 00:05:06,257
那嚷嚷你怎么样？
How about a IittIe
yeIIing at you then?

71
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,971
我是说，你不认为咱们有麻烦了吗，
I mean, you don't think
we're in troubIe

72
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:14,473
要是咱们都想不出
有什么可说的了？
if we can't come up
with anything to taIk about?

73
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:15,933
哦，行了。
咱们很好
Oh, come on.
We do okay.

74
00:05:15,975 --> 00:05:18,769
也许如果咱们
能多一块做活动，
Maybe if we did
more stuff together,

75
00:05:18,811 --> 00:05:21,605
就能有彼此的话题了
we couId come up with something
to say to each other.

76
00:05:21,647 --> 00:05:23,816
- 好的
- 真的？
- Okay.
- ReaIIy?

77
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,485
- 是的
- 好的，好吧
- Yeah.
- Okay, aII right.

78
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:29,280
那咱们能做什么呢，你知道，一起？
So what couId we do,
you know, together?

79
00:05:32,867 --> 00:05:34,827
唔……
WeII...

80
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:37,371
你知道什么会很好？
you know what's IoveIy?

81
00:05:39,582 --> 00:05:41,208
哇-路！
Va-Ioo...!

82
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,918
哦，雷，拜托
Oh, Ray, come on.

83
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,422
拜托，什么？
Come on, what?

84
00:05:46,463 --> 00:05:50,926
嘿，也许你可以嘿咻的时候说
Hey, maybe you couId taIk
during sex.

85
00:05:50,968 --> 00:05:54,179
看，这种事――
我一向很支持这个的
See, that's something--
I've aIways encouraged that.

86
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:56,891
咱们去植物园怎么样？
How about we go
to the botanicaI gardens?

87
00:05:56,932 --> 00:05:59,435
- 哈？
- 哈――哦
- Huh?
- Ha-- oh.

88
00:06:01,103 --> 00:06:05,149
嗯。也许吧
Hmm. Perhaps.

89
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,776
说不定很有趣的。拜托，
我是说，山间小路，
CouId be fun. Come on,
I mean, they have traiIs

90
00:06:07,818 --> 00:06:09,653
户外徒步
and nature hikes.

91
00:06:09,695 --> 00:06:13,115
- 哦，算了。老套
- 是的，得了吧，植物
- Oh, forget it. It's Iame.
- Yeah, come on, pIants.

92
00:06:13,157 --> 00:06:16,368
咱们卧室里就有植物。
咱们可从没谈论过它们
We got pIants in the bathroom.
We never taIk about them.

93
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,497
好吧，那还有什么咱们可以做的？
AII right, so what eIse
couId we do?

94
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:25,252
咱们可以看网队对湖人队的终场
We couId watch the end
of the Nets/Lakers game.

95
00:06:25,294 --> 00:06:26,921
开玩笑了。对不起
I'm kidding. I'm sorry.

96
00:06:26,962 --> 00:06:28,631
你知道，这就是问题的所在
You know,
that's what's wrong.

97
00:06:28,631 --> 00:06:30,591
我知道。我喜欢开小玩笑。
我脑筋迟钝
I know. I make IittIe jokes.
I'm dumb.

98
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:32,593
不，不，不
No, no, no,

99
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:34,553
咱们应该能够一起看比赛的
we shouId be abIe
to watch sports together.

100
00:06:34,553 --> 00:06:36,513
来吧，
你是体育作家
Come on,
you're a sportswriter.

101
00:06:36,513 --> 00:06:39,642
这是你生活中的一大部分，
我对你的生活感兴趣
It's a big part of your Iife.
I'm interested in your Iife.

102
00:06:39,683 --> 00:06:42,228
是的，是的，我想和你一起看比赛
Yes, yes, I wiII watch
the basketbaII game with you.

103
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,104
我想要那样
I wouId Iike that.

104
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:45,648
- 真的？
- 是的
- ReaIIy?
- Yes.

105
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:48,442
真的？
好吧，好的
ReaIIy?
AII right, yeah.

106
00:06:48,484 --> 00:06:51,403
- 好的，看篮球了
- 好的
- Okay, basketbaII it is.
- AII right.

107
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:53,739
哦，这太好了
Oh, this is good.

108
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:59,787
那么你能做什么来
对我感兴趣？
So what couId you do
to take more interest in me?

109
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:04,375
唔，我要坐在你边上
WeII, I was gonna sit
next to you

110
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,377
整个看比赛的过程中
during the watching
of the sports.

111
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:10,339
你知道，事实上，
我很想知道
You know, actuaIIy,
I wouId reaIIy Iike

112
00:07:10,381 --> 00:07:13,175
你对我刚看过的
这本书有什么看法
to know what you think
about this book I just read.

113
00:07:13,217 --> 00:07:17,054
你是说通过我读它？
You mean by me
reading it?

114
00:07:18,597 --> 00:07:21,433
是的，是的，我很喜欢这样
Yeah, yeah,
I wouId Iike that.

115
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:23,394
是……
Yeah...

116
00:07:23,435 --> 00:07:25,479
可是如果我要读它，
咱们就不能在一起了，
but if I'm reading it,
we wouIdn't be together,

117
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:28,065
而那正是我们想要的。
傻了吧！
which is what
we want. Nuts!

118
00:07:28,107 --> 00:07:30,025
不，别这样。
不，是的，真的
No, come on.
No, yeah, reaIIy.

119
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:32,528
我想让你读读，哈？
I want you
to read this, huh?

120
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,114
看，就是这本
Look, here it is.

121
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:37,283
“魔鬼森林”
''DeviI Wood.''

122
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:39,743
听起来还不是太糟了
Doesn't sound that bad.

123
00:07:39,785 --> 00:07:42,997
“魔鬼森林”
''DeviI Wood.''

124
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:45,249
你怎么想？
So what do you think?

125
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,216
那我不能通过再次向你的身体
And I couIdn't take
more of an interest

126
00:07:54,258 --> 00:07:57,052
介绍我自己
in you just by
reintroducing myseIf

127
00:07:57,094 --> 00:07:59,054
来对你感兴趣？
to your body?

128
00:07:59,096 --> 00:08:03,434
你把那书读了，
我就让你游够全程
You read that book,
I'II Iet you take the fuII tour.

129
00:08:03,475 --> 00:08:05,644
第一章
Chapter one.

130
00:08:30,794 --> 00:08:33,631
你发什么病？
What's wrong with you?

131
00:08:33,631 --> 00:08:37,843
醒醒。爸在路上了。
快看比赛
Wake up. Dad's on his way.
Put the game on.

132
00:08:39,094 --> 00:08:41,055
拜托
Come on.

133
00:08:42,264 --> 00:08:44,642
嘿，等等
Hey, wait a minute.

134
00:08:44,683 --> 00:08:47,186
我先问你件事
Let me ask you something.

135
00:08:47,228 --> 00:08:50,481
如果让一个人看
一本叫《魔鬼森林》的书，
If one was asked to read
a book caIIed ''DeviI Wood,''

136
00:08:50,522 --> 00:08:53,192
这个人是不是可以认为
这书会是恐怖
one wouId be correct in assuming
that the book was scary

137
00:08:53,234 --> 00:08:55,152
或者让人兴奋
或者有点恶搞，
or exciting or had
something ''deviIIy'' in it,

138
00:08:55,194 --> 00:08:57,780
是不是？
wouIdn't one?

139
00:08:57,821 --> 00:08:59,949
可以的
One wouId.

140
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,327
唔，那这人可就错了
WeII, then
one wouId be wrong.

141
00:09:03,369 --> 00:09:05,371
怎么了，雷蒙德？
What's going on,
Raymond?

142
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:07,998
黛比拉想让我读这个，
这样我们就能有共同点了
Debra wants me to read this
so we have stuff in common.

143
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,460
可我对天发誓，
这破烂就像是马用镇静剂
But I swear to God, this sucker's
Iike a horse tranquiIizer.

144
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:16,048
这，听听这段。
听听第一行
Here, Iisten to this.
Listen to this first Iine.

145
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,842
“想象一场雨如此之美，
''Imagine a rain so beautifuI

146
00:09:18,884 --> 00:09:21,554
它必定从不曾存在”
这是个什么意思？
it must never have existed.''
What does that mean?

147
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:25,140
这是什么意思？告诉我，快，
这是什么意思呀？
What does that mean? TeII me,
right now, what does that mean?

148
00:09:25,182 --> 00:09:28,561
- 我不知道
- 是呀
- I don't know.
- Yeah.

149
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:32,398
因为这全是胡说八道。
你必须把这书合上
Because it's nonsense taIk.
You have to cIose this book.

150
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:35,734
是的，看来小雷米看不成比赛了
Yeah, Iooks Iike IittIe Raymie
can't watch the game.

151
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:38,737
他有家庭作业了
He's got homework.

152
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,823
这是另一件恶心、可怕的事
That's the other
stinking, horribIe thing.

153
00:09:40,865 --> 00:09:43,367
她也想一起看比赛，
就像今天的尼克斯队
She wants to watch sports
together too, Iike the Knicks today.

154
00:09:43,409 --> 00:09:45,160
为什么？
Why?

155
00:09:45,202 --> 00:09:47,872
我们情人节一起看了比赛，
We watched the game together
on VaIentine's Day

156
00:09:47,913 --> 00:09:49,832
显然进展不错――
and apparentIy that went weII--

157
00:09:49,874 --> 00:09:51,876
粘在一起，瞎聊乱扯
the being together and taIking.

158
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:54,545
- 你们说的什么？
- 谁知道呢？
- What did you guys taIk about?
- Who knows?

159
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,840
所以我才叫你们过来
That's why I asked
you guys to come over.

160
00:09:57,882 --> 00:10:01,051
我需要你们稍稍
分担一点她的注意力
I need you to kind of
absorb some of her.

161
00:10:03,012 --> 00:10:05,389
那我们是你们
So we're Iike pawns

162
00:10:05,431 --> 00:10:08,309
变态游戏里的卒子？
in your sick game?

163
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:10,269
如果她问起来，
If she asks,
Iet's just say that

164
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:12,229
就说你来是因为你还在为
you came by because you're
stiII bummed out

165
00:10:12,229 --> 00:10:13,898
没有女朋友郁闷
about not having a girIfriend.

166
00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:16,567
- 我就是还在为那个郁闷
- 好极了
- I am stiII bummed out about that.
- Perfect.

167
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:19,361
我回来了
I'm back.

168
00:10:19,361 --> 00:10:22,156
好的，你不开心。
保持这个表情
Okay, you're not happy.
Keep that Iook.

169
00:10:24,408 --> 00:10:28,287
- 嘿，买了点垃圾食品看比赛
- 啊，好主意
- Hey, got junk food for the game.
- Ah, sweet.

170
00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:30,623
我把孩子放你妈那了，
这样咱们――
I dropped the kids off
at your mom's so we--

171
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:33,709
罗伯特来了？
Robert's here?

172
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:35,211
我知道。我知道
I know. I know.

173
00:10:35,252 --> 00:10:38,005
本来应该是
咱们的“集体活动”时间
It's supposed to be
our ''do stuff together'' time.

174
00:10:38,047 --> 00:10:41,050
我想他还在为
没女朋友的事郁闷，
And I think he's stiII depressed
about not having a girIfriend,

175
00:10:41,091 --> 00:10:44,178
你知道，作为失败者
you know, being a Ioser.

176
00:10:45,888 --> 00:10:48,307
还能怎么样呢？
What are you gonna do,
right?

177
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:51,727
又不能就那么把他踢出去
I can't just kick him out.

178
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:55,231
哦，唔，好吧
Oh, weII, okay.

179
00:10:55,272 --> 00:10:57,066
是
Yeah.

180
00:10:57,107 --> 00:10:59,276
- 这么说你在读这本书了？
- 是的
- So you're reading the book?
- Yeah.

181
00:10:59,318 --> 00:11:01,028
是吗，你看着还喜欢吗？
Yeah, you Iiking it so far?

182
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,405
这实在非常、非常、
非常好
It's reaIIy very, very,
very, very nice.

183
00:11:03,447 --> 00:11:05,366
那就好
Good.

184
00:11:05,407 --> 00:11:07,618
- 嘿，罗伯特，你好吗？
- 还好
- Hey, Robert, how you doing?
- Okay.

185
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,330
- 只想过来走走
- 哦，好的，随时欢迎
- Just thought I'd stop by.
- Oh, good, anytime.

186
00:11:14,124 --> 00:11:16,085
尼克斯又打起精神，
The Knicks are coming
back to Iife,

187
00:11:16,126 --> 00:11:18,087
6粒不受阻截的投篮得分
now scoring six
unanswered buckets.

188
00:11:20,923 --> 00:11:22,466
球现在在中场位置
Ward now with the baII

189
00:11:22,508 --> 00:11:24,093
Ward的操控下……
at midcourt...

190
00:11:24,134 --> 00:11:26,220
你这周的专栏写什么？
So what's your coIumn
about this week?

191
00:11:26,262 --> 00:11:28,764
离中场休息还有45秒
45 seconds Ieft to go
in the haIf.

192
00:11:28,806 --> 00:11:31,267
事实上，我正要写尼克斯队的比赛，
ActuaIIy, I'm doing it
about the Knicks,

193
00:11:31,308 --> 00:11:33,852
所以咱们看着，这很好，是的
so it's good that
we're watching it, yeah.

194
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:36,564
有意思
Interesting.

195
00:11:36,605 --> 00:11:41,318
你想挖挖我们的意见？
想谈谈吗？
WouId you Iike to bounce
some ideas off of us? TaIk about it?

196
00:11:43,612 --> 00:11:46,115
嘿，爸，什么事？
Hey, Dad, what's up?

197
00:11:46,156 --> 00:11:48,242
把薯片拿来。
就这个事
Pass me the chips.
That's what's up.

198
00:11:50,035 --> 00:11:52,037
你来看比赛的，弗兰克？
Are you here
for the game, Frank?

199
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,915
不，来听妙语的
No, the sparkIing conversation.

200
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:59,211
好了，快点，屁股动起来！
Okay, come on,
move your ass!

201
00:11:59,211 --> 00:12:00,921
嘿，爸――！
Hey, Dad--!

202
00:12:00,963 --> 00:12:03,883
对不起――移动活跃点
Sorry-- step IiveIy.

203
00:12:07,678 --> 00:12:09,763
这话不错
That's good.

204
00:12:09,805 --> 00:12:12,433
拜托，接着，跳呀，跳起来！
Come on, get it,
jump, jump!

205
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,354
怎么了，她在等烤箱呢？
What, she waiting for something
to come out of the oven?

206
00:12:17,396 --> 00:12:19,523
不，弗兰克，
No, Frank,

207
00:12:19,565 --> 00:12:22,860
雷和我一起看篮球赛
Ray and I are watching
a basketbaII game together.

208
00:12:22,902 --> 00:12:25,070
哦，他做什么了？
Oh, what did he do?

209
00:12:27,489 --> 00:12:28,699
什么意思？
What do you mean?

210
00:12:28,741 --> 00:12:31,493
他做错什么了，
你要这么对他？
What did he do wrong
that you'd do this to him?

211
00:12:31,535 --> 00:12:33,120
别说了，爸
Stop it, Dad.

212
00:12:33,162 --> 00:12:36,165
你知道，弗兰克，
你家也能收到比赛的
You know, Frank, the game is on
at your house, too.

213
00:12:36,207 --> 00:12:38,667
嘿，别朝我发火。
雷请我来的
Hey, don't get mad at me.
Ray invited me.

214
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:41,462
骇人听闻的谎言
That's an outrageous Iie.

215
00:12:46,675 --> 00:12:48,552
他也邀请你了？
He invite you, too?

216
00:12:48,594 --> 00:12:53,098
我，呃……
I, uh...

217
00:12:54,391 --> 00:12:58,229
对不起，雷蒙德，我试了
Sorry, Raymond, I tried.

218
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,650
放轻松
Easy now, easy.

219
00:13:02,691 --> 00:13:04,944
- 我真不能相信你
- 好了，好的。让我……
- I cannot beIieve you.
- Okay, good. Let me--

220
00:13:04,944 --> 00:13:06,904
- 真难以置信！
- 我只是――我只是――
- I cannot beIieve you!
- I just-- I just--

221
00:13:06,904 --> 00:13:09,281
- 你只是什么？
- 你能不能让我把话说完？
- You just what?
- WiII you Iet me finish my sentence?

222
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:12,618
如果你让我说完，
那我就能说完
If you Iet me finish,
then I couId finish it.

223
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,372
唔，现在我不知道怎么说了。
这一切太突然了
WeII, now I'm at a Ioss for words.
This is aII so sudden.

224
00:13:18,332 --> 00:13:22,044
真难以相信
你甚至不能和我一起看比赛，
I can't beIieve you can't even
watch sports with me,

225
00:13:22,086 --> 00:13:25,839
你喜欢的事？
你非得拿他们俩当缓冲的？
something you Iike? You gotta have
these two over as buffers?

226
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,175
我不认为叫他们俩来
有什么大不了的
I didn't think inviting them over
wouId be such a big deaI.

227
00:13:28,217 --> 00:13:30,636
他们很适合作伴
They're good company.

228
00:13:30,678 --> 00:13:33,013
连我都不认这个帐
Even I don't buy that.

229
00:13:34,765 --> 00:13:38,310
- 你有没有读一点那本书？
- 我读了很多了
- Have you read any of that book?
- I read a Iot.

230
00:13:38,352 --> 00:13:43,148
- 是吗，讲的什么？
- 讲的是“一场雨那么美，
- Yeah, what's it about?
- About ''a rain that's so beautifuI,

231
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,360
我都不相信它存在”
I can't even beIieve
it existed.''

232
00:13:46,402 --> 00:13:49,321
这是第一行。
你读了一行！
That's the first Iine.
You've read one Iine!

233
00:13:49,321 --> 00:13:51,282
我正打算读第二行的，
And I was gonna read
the next one

234
00:13:51,323 --> 00:13:53,492
我刚一从昏迷中苏醒
when I came out of my coma.

235
00:13:59,373 --> 00:14:00,958
就这样？
So that's it?

236
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,586
你就没打算投入任何努力，
是不是？
You're just not gonna put
any effort into this, are you?

237
00:14:03,627 --> 00:14:06,380
哦，别这样，我只是不认为
需要把咱们的生活
Oh, come on, I just don't think
we need to turn our Iives

238
00:14:06,422 --> 00:14:09,300
上下颠倒，
就为了能有什么话题好谈
upside down just so we can have
more to taIk about.

239
00:14:09,341 --> 00:14:13,429
尝试跟我说话会
“让你的生活上下颠倒”？
Trying to taIk to me is
''turning your Iife upside down''?

240
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,140
- 我只是――我――我――
- 别说了
- I just-- I-- I--
- Stop taIking.

241
00:14:19,184 --> 00:14:22,396
是的，雷，别费事跟我说话了
Yeah, Ray, don't even
bother taIking to me.

242
00:14:22,438 --> 00:14:24,440
享受你的昏迷吧
You just enjoy your coma.

243
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,360
好吧，也许我会的
AII right, maybe I wiII.

244
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:34,283
看，这就是为什么我不建立关系
See, this is why I stay
out of reIationships.

245
00:14:34,325 --> 00:14:36,994
是的，是因为这个
Yeah, that's why.

246
00:14:47,163 --> 00:14:50,374
哦，嗨，亲爱的。
你来接孩子？
Oh, hi, dear.
You here to pick up the kids?

247
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:53,252
哦，是的，是，孩子，
是的，一会就好，是的
Oh, right, yeah, the kids,
yeah, in a minute, yeah.

248
00:14:55,254 --> 00:14:57,256
弗兰克说你和黛比拉
Frank said that you
and Debra were having

249
00:14:57,298 --> 00:15:00,843
在进行大声的讨论
some sort
of a Ioud discussion?

250
00:15:00,885 --> 00:15:04,221
别操心了，妈。
一切正常
Don't worry about it, Ma.
Everything's fine.

251
00:15:04,263 --> 00:15:06,432
你在躲她？
You hiding from her?

252
00:15:06,474 --> 00:15:09,560
是的
Yeah.

253
00:15:09,602 --> 00:15:12,063
这可真是好事
Then this shouId be good.

254
00:15:15,066 --> 00:15:17,318
你干什么，出门躲着？
What are you, hiding out?

255
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,904
不，我来接孩子。
我刚才不是问孩子了吗？
No, I'm picking up the kids.
Didn't I just ask for the kids?

256
00:15:19,946 --> 00:15:23,241
- 搞什么，妈？
- 是啊，别麻烦了
- What the heII, Ma?
- Yeah, don't bother.

257
00:15:23,282 --> 00:15:25,076
我来接他们
I'II get 'em.

258
00:15:25,117 --> 00:15:27,620
我说了我接。
我又能力接他们
I said I'II get 'em.
I'm capabIe of getting them.

259
00:15:27,662 --> 00:15:29,997
我说了我会接他们。
你们好吗，孩子们？
I said I wouId pick them up.
how you doing, kids?

260
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:32,291
我只是跟我父母大声招呼，哈？
I was saying heIIo
to my parents, huh?

261
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,460
人就不能跟自己所爱的人问个好？
A guy can't greet
his Ioved ones?

262
00:15:34,502 --> 00:15:36,671
那你不介意跟他们呆在一起了？
So you don't mind
spending time with them?

263
00:15:36,712 --> 00:15:38,631
哦，行了。
让我消停会行吗？
Oh, come on.
WiII you give me a break?

264
00:15:38,673 --> 00:15:41,676
我试了，哈？
我没试吗？
I tried, huh? Didn't I try?

265
00:15:41,717 --> 00:15:44,011
哦，好吧，我了解。
你生气我没跟你说话
Oh, okay, I get it. You're mad
at me for not taIking to you,

266
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:46,555
所以你现在不跟我说话了。
多有意思呀！
so now you're not taIking to me.
Isn't that interesting?

267
00:15:46,597 --> 00:15:48,557
也许你应该考虑一下，哈？
Maybe you shouId think
about that, huh?

268
00:15:48,557 --> 00:15:52,478
叼根烟斗就更帅了
Put that pipe
in your mouth, hmm?

269
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,481
什么？你看什么呢？
What?
What are you Iooking at?

270
00:17:09,639 --> 00:17:11,933
需要帮忙吗？
May we heIp you?

271
00:17:11,974 --> 00:17:15,478
- 不，我们没事
- 有只怪猫
- No, we're fine.
- There's a weird cat.

272
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,232
刚才在外头。
是的，现在走了
He was outside.
Yeah, it's gone now.

273
00:17:19,273 --> 00:17:22,109
一只褐色的眼睛，
令一只好像没有眼睛
It had a brown eye
and, Iike, one no eye.

274
00:17:22,151 --> 00:17:25,154
就是那样子。怪怪的
It was one of those.
It was weird.

275
00:17:27,782 --> 00:17:29,659
- 喔
- 我知道。那真是……
- Wow.
- I know. That's reaIIy...

276
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,913
- 真的有点温馨
- 什么，那个？他们都没说话
- ReaIIy kind of sweet.
- What, that? They're not taIking.

277
00:17:33,955 --> 00:17:36,332
唔，感觉他们不需要
WeII, it's Iike
they don't have to.

278
00:17:36,374 --> 00:17:38,292
我不认为是他们不需要
I don't think it's 'cause
they don't have to.

279
00:17:38,334 --> 00:17:40,211
我想是他们不想
I think it's 'cause
they don't want to.

280
00:17:40,211 --> 00:17:42,421
我不知道
I don't know.

281
00:17:42,463 --> 00:17:45,466
他们看起来那么合拍
They seemed so in tune.

282
00:17:59,397 --> 00:18:02,358
我见到奶牛了
I see cows.

283
00:18:05,361 --> 00:18:07,905
这有一只狗狗，
这还有一支狗狗
Here's one doggie,
and here's another doggie.

284
00:18:07,947 --> 00:18:09,865
看看哪。好极了。
你知道吗？
Look at that. That's great.
You know what?

285
00:18:09,907 --> 00:18:13,619
我需要你再画四只狗狗、
一只小鸡
I need you to draw up
four more doggies and a chicken.

286
00:18:16,247 --> 00:18:18,207
你看好这个？
That Iooks good to you?

287
00:18:18,249 --> 00:18:22,753
他们看起来和彼此那么舒服
They just seem so comfortabIe
with each other.

288
00:18:22,795 --> 00:18:24,714
我不知道
I don't know.

289
00:18:24,755 --> 00:18:27,174
也许咱们就要到达能够享受
Maybe we're at that point
where we can be comfortabIe

290
00:18:27,216 --> 00:18:29,719
简单的彼此相处的那点上了
just being with each other.

291
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,179
你想像他们那样？
You wanna be Iike them?

292
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:36,809
也不完全是了
Not exactIy.

293
00:18:36,851 --> 00:18:40,354
不过你想想，
如果咱们不那么操心
But just imagine how much better
our VaIentine's dinner

294
00:18:40,396 --> 00:18:42,315
把每一秒钟都用奶油的话题填满，
wouId have been
if we weren't so worried

295
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:45,818
情人节晚餐会是多么好
about fiIIing up every singIe second
with taIk about butter.

296
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,321
是你唠叨个没完面包的事
You were the one
who was babbIing about the bread.

297
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:50,865
然后自然就会有我的奶油理论了
It's onIy naturaI you're gonna get
my butter theory.

298
00:18:50,907 --> 00:18:54,410
好了，我知道。我知道，
AII right,
I know. I know,

299
00:18:54,452 --> 00:18:57,121
可要是咱们能够简简单单地开心，
but what if we had
just been happy

300
00:18:57,163 --> 00:18:59,081
就因为在外头，
to be out of the house,

301
00:18:59,123 --> 00:19:02,209
就咱们俩，享受和平与安静呢？
just us enjoying
the peace and the quiet?

302
00:19:02,251 --> 00:19:05,630
- 我的确喜欢安静
- 使得，我也是
- I do Iike quiet.
- Yeah, me, too.

303
00:19:05,671 --> 00:19:07,715
还有和平
And peace.

304
00:19:07,757 --> 00:19:10,551
我猜问题在于
I guess the question is

305
00:19:10,593 --> 00:19:13,095
以后的30年里，
for the next 30 years,

306
00:19:13,137 --> 00:19:14,639
在安静的时候，
when it's quiet,

307
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,933
而咱们也没什么要对彼此说的，
and we don't have anything
to say to each other,

308
00:19:16,974 --> 00:19:20,436
我是不是介意你坐在我身边
do I mind having you
sit next to me?

309
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:23,105
不，我不介意
No, I don't mind.

310
00:19:23,147 --> 00:19:25,691
哦，那就好
Okay, good.

311
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:29,904
- 你介意我做你身边吗？
- 不，你香香的
- You mind sitting next to me?
- No, you smeII good.

312
00:19:32,073 --> 00:19:34,659
- 你为什么说30年？
- 哦，我不知道
- Why did you say 30 years?
- Oh, I don't know.

313
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,994
- 你认为我70岁的时候会死？
- 不
- Do you think I'm gonna die at 70?
- No.

314
00:19:37,036 --> 00:19:39,205
- 因为30年是个奇怪的数
- 好了，嘘！
- 'Cause 30 years is a weird number.
- Okay, shh!

315
00:19:39,247 --> 00:19:41,207
别说话了
Let's not taIk.

316
00:19:41,249 --> 00:19:44,293
- 好的。对他们管用
- 是的
- Okay. It works for them.
- Yeah.

317
00:19:45,503 --> 00:19:49,257
呃呵――我再也不能看他吃东西了
Ugh-- I can't Iook
