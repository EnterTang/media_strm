1
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,100
你的救命恩人
Your salvation.

2
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,100
驾 驾
Hyah, hyah!

3
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:42,420
我觉得我们之前没见过
I don't believe we've ever met.

4
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,960
不 我们没有
No, we haven't.

5
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,340
你总是像一种
You know, you always seemed like a--

6
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:53,010
一种市场测试之类的东西
a market-tested kind of thing.

7
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:57,180
大名鼎鼎 伤疤别致
Big gun, tasteful scar.

8
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,560
却被锁在狭小范围内
Locked in your little cycle

9
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,730
像一只珍贵的贵宾犬咬自己的尾巴
like a prized poodle after its own tail.

10
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:04,150
你听起来像是一个对满腹胆识
You sound like a man who's grown tired

11
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:06,070
感到厌倦的男人
of wearing his guts on the inside.

12
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,730
没必要再试探了
There's no need to get testy.

13
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:12,910
我只是对你的世界观表示好奇
I'm just curious about your worldview.

14
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,950
是某种半本土化的胡言乱语吗
Some kind of half-native mumbo jumbo?

15
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,700
很简单
It's simple.

16
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,160
我相信只有真正勇敢的人
I believe that only the truly brave

17
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,960
才可以审视这世界并且理解
can look at the world and understand

18
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,460
全部
that all of it--

19
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,130
神 人
gods, men,

20
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:29,340
以及其他所有的人 都会以悲剧收场
everything else-- will end badly.

21
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:33,510
无人得救
No one will be saved.

22
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,970
也许我们比我想的有更多的共同点
Maybe we've got more in common than I thought.

23
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,510
你呢
What about you?

24
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,180
什么风把你吹到这里
What turns of fate have brought you here?

25
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:43,230
说来话长
It's a long story.

26
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,730
而且我们没时间了
And we don't have the time.

27
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:47,610
可惜 你比你的朋友有更多的时间
Got more time than your friend, sadly.

28
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:50,110
我朋友出现之前还有几天时间
It will be a few more days before my friends show up.

29
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,110
三天
Three days.

30
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,610
正常情况下
Normally.

31
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,320
我怕我没有时间等
I'm afraid I don't have time for that,

32
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:57,030
我们现在就走
so we're leaving now.

33
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:04,500
我收到一个需要烟火效应的请求
I've got a request for a pyrotechnic effect.

34
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:07,880
Los Diablos 低利息 分两次收费
Los Diablos, low-yield, two charges.

Los Diablos是一张由委内瑞拉作曲家Aldemaro Romero作曲的33转黑胶唱片，由唱片公司Cymbal发行于1962年，。

35
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,880
同意
Approved.

36
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,680
批准
Authorizing.

37
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:38,240
动起来  Hector
Step lively, Hector.

38
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:54,800
你还有什么遗言吗
Any last words?

39
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,590
别废话 快动手
Get it over with.

40
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,700
啊
Yah!

41
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,680
操你妈
Motherfucker.

42
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,980
一局制胜
One match.

43
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,360
你是一个能干的人
You're a capable man.

44
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,650
要去的那个地方我们能帮得上忙吗
We could do with your help where we're going.

45
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,070
恐怕不能
Afraid not.

46
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,360
我们欠你一份人情
We owe you a debt.

47
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,200
不 你朋友只欠
No, your friend here

48
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,280
我一个承诺或两个
simply owes me a word or two.

49
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,370
这就行了
That'll do.

50
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:02,580
和一个
And a word of advice--

51
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:05,580
你要找的那个东西的建议
that thing you're looking for?

52
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:08,170
你永远不会在那个保险柜里找到它
You're never gonna find it in that safe.

53
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,890
我七岁时 他们来到我的城镇
I was seven when they rode into my town.

54
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,350
戴着面具 有着魔鬼的角
Masked men in devils' horns.

55
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,770
他们杀了所有人
They killed everyone--

56
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,690
妇女 孩童 甚至那些动物
women, children, even the animals.

57
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:41,780
他们把我母亲从上到下糟蹋了一遍
They gutted my mother from her jaw to her sex.

58
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,950
我不得不把她的血
I had to paint her warm blood

59
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:45,620
涂在我身上
over my skin to make sure

60
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,790
好让他们以为我已经死了
that they would think I was dead.

61
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,330
我追踪他们每一个人
Every one of them I tracked down,

62
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:52,380
我再一次在我身上涂上他们的血
I used their blood to paint my skin again.

63
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,880
只有一个人活着
Only one man left.

64
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,720
蛇首
The head of the snake.

65
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,550
他叫什么名字
What's his name?

66
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,810
他有很多名字
He has many names.

67
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:12,850
大部分人都叫他Wyatt
Most know him as Wyatt.

68
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,170
嘿 小姑娘 这 这是什么
Hey, little girl, what-- what is this?

69
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:16,460
这是什么意思
What does it mean?

70
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,590
不要浪费你的力气 女士
Don't waste your breath, lady.

71
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:21,800
这东西是他们所谓的宗教的一部分
That thing's part of their so-called religion.

72
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,130
他们一个字也不会跟你说的
Ain't none of them's gonna tell you nothing about that.

73
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,480
一小时5刀
It's $5 for an hour,

74
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,520
你先洗澡的话4刀
4 if you bathe first.

75
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,940
如果我们只要一个
Well, if we just get the one,

76
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:43,570
第二次和接下来能打折吗
do I get a discount for being second and all?

77
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:46,820
我相信我们能合作愉快
I'm sure we can work something out.

78
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,450
来吧
Come on.

79
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,300
那个高个子 我之前见过他
The tall one, I've seen him before,

80
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,970
在邮局的窗口那晃荡
hanging in the window of the post office.

81
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,300
土匪
Bandits?

82
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,010
你认为他们在这里是为了什么
Do you think they're here for something?

83
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,800
比起Franny的正面 我认为他们
I think they're interested in more than a turn

84
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:11,510
对这感兴趣
at Franny's backside.

85
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,850
我想他和Hector是同行的
I think he rides with Hector.

86
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,980
那个人是他们说的与野人一起生活的人吗
Is that the one they say lives out with the savages?

87
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,360
就是他
That's the one.

88
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,620
就要走了 我才刚到这
Taking off? I just got here.

89
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,290
我要什么你已经给了
You gave me what I needed.

90
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:41,670
这就是我擅长的吗
So, is that all I'm good for?

91
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:44,760
- 释放一点压力  - 谁说我有压力
- Letting off a little stress? - Who says I'm stressed?

92
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,880
你说的
You have your tells.

93
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,930
是 Bernard
Oh, yes, Bernard,

94
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:54,430
观察家
master of observation.

95
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,150
明天我要跟Ford谈一谈
Tomorrow I have to talk to Ford.

96
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,030
- 为什么  - 他在乐园里制造混乱
- Why? - He's creating chaos in the park.

97
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:12,280
而董事会随时会降责
And the board will be descending at any moment.

98
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,200
我需要再来点时间
I need to buy some time.

99
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,710
有任何建议吗
Some advice?

100
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:20,040
最好不要告诉他你很紧张或有所防备
Best to not show him you're nervous or defensive.

101
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,500
我没什么可防备的
I have nothing to be defensive about.

102
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,420
那就不要把你的手臂交叉起来
Then don't cross your arms.

103
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,420
这是一个古老的本能
It's an ancient instinct.

104
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:30,090
腹部是每个生物最脆弱的部分
The belly is the most vulnerable part of every animal.

105
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,350
把我跟与一个凶残的野兽做比较 听起来很性感
It's so sexy being compared to a frightened beast.

106
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,470
Ah.

107
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,520
看
There.

108
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,940
这才是你要做的姿势
That's the posture you're looking for.

109
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,530
有时候
Sometimes,

110
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:52,820
只要你竭尽全力
despite your best efforts,

111
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:55,620
你就真的很迷人了
you can actually be quite charming.

112
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,720
邻居有抱怨过吗
Have the neighbors complained?

113
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,760
只是说 他们只是问些问题
Safe to say, they're asking questions.

114
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,770
最好还是不要动这些石头
The rocks would prefer not to move,

115
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:19,640
但是我们就是要动
but we shall move them yet.

116
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:25,360
也许我能帮你
Perhaps I can help you with that.

117
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,690
你创造的故事线
The narrative you're creating

118
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,780
显然花费的努力巨大
is clearly a massive endeavor.

119
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,860
如果你需要更多的时间 我相信董事会
If you need more time, I'm sure the board

120
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,360
更乐意效劳
would be happy to oblige.

121
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:33,660
我相信他们更会乐意
I'm sure they'd be happier

122
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,830
无限地为我延期
for me to delay it indefinitely.

123
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,540
跟我来
Come with me.

124
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,800
你以为我会生气
You imagine I have gone mad...

125
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:54,930
对吗
do you?

126
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,010
会迷失方向
Lost my way?

127
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,470
我们只是关心
We're simply concerned

128
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,600
你做出改变的内容
about the extent of the changes you're making.

129
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,230
我们想要保护你的遗产
We want to protect your legacy.

130
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,650
我的遗产
My legacy?

131
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,030
你们其实并不是很喜欢这个地方 是不是
You don't like this place very much, do you?

132
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:16,410
这几年我看到你们进进出出很多次
I've seen many of you come and go over the years,

133
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:19,540
我能说出来谁是乐在其中的
and I can tell the ones who enjoy their time here

134
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,870
谁不是
and the ones who don't.

135
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,830
我羡慕它
I admire it,

136
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,630
羡慕它的大胆无畏
the audacity of it.

137
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:29,090
- 噢  - 我差点忘了它是有多美丽
- Oh. - I've forgotten how beautiful it is.

138
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:32,010
当我还是个孩子的时候和父母来过这儿一次
I came here once as a child with my parents.

139
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:34,300
我觉得我甚至就坐在这张桌子上
I think we even sat at this table.

140
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:37,260
又或者 是那张
Or maybe-- maybe that one.

141
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,890
当我开始在这工作的时候
When I started working here,

142
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:48,360
我意识到这地方并不是我热衷的地方
I realized this place wasn't something I would enjoy.

143
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,940
恩
Ah.

144
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,780
一开始 我设想所有的东西都是
In the beginning, I imagined things would be

145
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:59,240
完美地平衡的
perfectly balanced.

146
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,910
甚至跟我搭档Arnold对它的效果打赌 
Even had a bet with my partner, Arnold, to that effect.

147
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,910
我们做了一百个有希望的故事情节
We made a hundred hopeful storylines.

148
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,880
当然 几乎没有人赞同我们的故事
Of course, almost no one took us up on them.

149
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,090
我输了那个赌约
I lost the bet.

150
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:14,510
Anold总是揪出一个人的阴暗面
Arnold always held a somewhat dim view of people.

151
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:16,630
他更偏爱主人
He preferred the hosts.

152
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,720
他打赌我不会让你们参与进来
He begged me to not let you people in,

153
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,180
商人
the moneymen.

154
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,510

Delos.

155
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,270
但是我告诉他我们是可以的
But I told him we'd be fine,

156
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:25,890
你们不会明白是在为什么付钱
that you didn't understand what you were paying for.

157
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:29,480
这不是一个商业投资 不是一个主题公园
It's not a business venture, not a theme park,

158
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,070
而是整个世界
but an entire world.

159
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,360
我们设计了它的每一方每一寸
We designed every inch of it.

160
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,450
每片草的叶子
Every blade of grass.

161
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:49,880
在这里 我们就是神
In here, we were gods.

162
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,800
但你们仅仅是我们的客人
And you were merely our guests.

163
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:15,070
但是这对Arnold怎么可行
And how did that work out for Arnold?

164
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:19,610
可惜 他失去了理智
Sadly, he lost his perspective.

165
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:22,370
他疯了
He went mad.

166
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,740
而我没有 你们都知道
I haven't, as you well know.

167
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:28,790
我总是对事情
I have always seen things

168
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:30,630
明查洞悉
very clearly.

169
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,300
这就是我和我父母之前坐的桌子
This is the table I sat at with my parents.

170
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:43,680
这是我坐的椅子
This is the chair I sat in.

171
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,810
我们知道客人的一切信息 不是吗
We know everything about our guests, don't we?

172
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:50,810
就像我们知道员工的一切信息
As we know everything about our employees.

173
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,730
我希望你能小心Bernard一点
I do hope you will be careful with Bernard.

174
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:03,030
他很敏感
He has a sensitive disposition.

175
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,000
请再说一遍 小姐
I beg your pardon, señorita.

176
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:19,550
这些年来像你这样的人有很多
There have been many of you over the years,

177
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:21,970
而我们总是 差不多总是
and we have always-- almost always

178
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:24,430
找到说服你们的方式
found a way to make it work.

179
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:29,480
我好好的跟你说
So, I will ask you nicely,

180
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,520
请
please...

181
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,560
不要挡我的路
don't get in my way.

182
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:51,330
董事会会同意我的观点
The board will agree with me.

183
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:53,250
他们会派代表来
They'll be sending a representative.

184
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:55,000
他们已经派来了
But they already have.

185
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:56,750
我认为他们会跟你说
I thought they would've told you.

186
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,550
还需要菜单吗
That won't be necessary, Manu.

187
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:03,380
不需要
Not anymore.

188
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:04,640
你可以忙别的了
You can join the others.

189
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,780
你可以告诉董事会我的故事线
You can tell the board that my narrative

190
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,780
会按时完成的
will be completed on time,
