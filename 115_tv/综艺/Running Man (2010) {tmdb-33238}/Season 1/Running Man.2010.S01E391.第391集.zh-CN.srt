391
00:32:38,434 --> 00:32:40,594
You see all the wars in this world

392
00:32:40,644 --> 00:32:44,134
are not fought
over money or material things.

393
00:32:44,954 --> 00:32:46,614
They are all fought...

394
00:32:49,354 --> 00:32:50,454
over belief.

395
00:32:51,314 --> 00:32:54,674
More specifically,
the primacy of one man's belief

396
00:32:54,754 --> 00:32:56,254
over another man's.

397
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:04,564
Harry has stolen my right to believe.

398
00:33:07,114 --> 00:33:08,674
How did you fall...

399
00:33:09,994 --> 00:33:13,654
for such a broken, worthless gambler?

400
00:33:18,594 --> 00:33:20,994
I can't possibly imagine.

401
00:33:24,234 --> 00:33:25,954
<i>Your brother called.
He's on his way.</i>

402
00:33:27,474 --> 00:33:30,074
Good.
Harry won't be far behind.

403
00:33:31,674 --> 00:33:32,594
Get them ready.

404
00:33:52,842 --> 00:33:54,142
<i>Take her upstairs.</i>

405
00:34:04,762 --> 00:34:06,162
<i>I owe you an apology.</i>

406
00:34:06,602 --> 00:34:08,640
When I killed your mother, I was...

407
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,622
young, naive.

408
00:34:10,662 --> 00:34:12,882
I really understand how much trouble
it would cause me later.

409
00:34:12,962 --> 00:34:14,942
I will never put that bracelet on you!

410
00:34:15,042 --> 00:34:19,422
Whatever our father...
might have told you in his last days,

411
00:34:19,562 --> 00:34:21,102
<i>he didn't want it to end like this.</i>

412
00:34:21,162 --> 00:34:24,522
Vincent didn't want you
NEAR the bracelet.

413
00:34:24,642 --> 00:34:27,762
That's why he always kept you secret.

414
00:34:34,802 --> 00:34:36,802
You have a lot of your mother in you.

415
00:34:37,762 --> 00:34:42,662
She said pretty much
the exact same thing to me 15 years ago.

416
00:34:46,962 --> 00:34:50,242
<i>Ashton House is registered
to Lermontov Industries.</i>

417
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:53,482
If Golding has Anna and Daisy there,
they could be hidden anywhere.

418
00:34:53,562 --> 00:34:56,482
Detective Superintendent Winter to AR19,

419
00:34:56,842 --> 00:34:59,922
<i>we're 5 minutes from Ashton House.
What's your ETA?</i>

420
00:35:00,002 --> 00:35:02,242
<i>ETA to Ashton House: 10 minutes.</i>

421
00:35:53,602 --> 00:35:55,482
<i>Ashton House, next left, Sir.</i>

422
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,090
Ah!

423
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,590
Huh!

424
00:36:09,002 --> 00:36:09,722
Mum!

425
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:11,642
Take your hands off me!

426
00:36:14,082 --> 00:36:14,802
<i>Mum!</i>

427
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,830
Oh!

428
00:36:18,522 --> 00:36:19,322
Mum!

429
00:37:02,282 --> 00:37:03,682
<i>Please, Nikhail! Please!</i>

430
00:37:04,402 --> 00:37:05,922
<i>- Please!</i>
<i>- Harry will be here soon.</i>

431
00:37:06,362 --> 00:37:08,642
- <i>Give me the keys.</i>
- Please, please!

432
00:37:08,842 --> 00:37:11,802
<i>Please, let her go! Please!
Please, let her go!</i>

433
00:37:16,562 --> 00:37:17,322
<i>Harry!</i>

434
00:37:18,762 --> 00:37:19,682
Alistair!

435
00:37:20,122 --> 00:37:21,322
Harry, it's OK.

436
00:37:22,242 --> 00:37:25,242
It's OK. I believe you.

437
00:37:25,962 --> 00:37:27,962
<i>And I'm sorry I ever doubted you.</i>

438
00:37:28,042 --> 00:37:29,042
OK.

439
00:37:29,922 --> 00:37:31,022
NO, HARRY GET DOWN!

440
00:37:32,402 --> 00:37:33,902
<i>AH!</i>

441
00:37:34,402 --> 00:37:35,002
<i>SIR!</i>

442
00:37:37,602 --> 00:37:39,202
<i>Sir! Sir!</i>

443
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:41,880
Ah!

444
00:37:41,882 --> 00:37:44,202
<i>Sir, it's gonna be OK.
It's gonna be OK.</i>

445
00:37:46,042 --> 00:37:46,922
<i>Oh, God!</i>

446
00:37:47,922 --> 00:37:48,722
Alistair?

447
00:37:49,842 --> 00:37:50,842
<i>Stay with us.</i>

448
00:37:52,802 --> 00:37:55,362
Hold on. Hold on.

449
00:37:57,002 --> 00:38:00,362
Hold on.

450
00:38:11,562 --> 00:38:12,562
<i>DAISYYYY!</i>

451
00:38:12,802 --> 00:38:14,242
<i>Go! I got this!</i>

452
00:38:17,002 --> 00:38:20,682
D.S. Chohan. Officer down.
Shot to the chest. EMS required.

453
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:27,762
<i>... shooter's AO.</i>

454
00:38:33,922 --> 00:38:35,322
He has Daisy and Anna!

455
00:38:36,882 --> 00:38:40,362
<i>D.S. Chohan, AR19.
ETA, 6 minutes.</i>

456
00:38:42,202 --> 00:38:44,082
No! Stop!

457
00:38:44,762 --> 00:38:47,642
No! Stop! Wait.

458
00:38:48,002 --> 00:38:50,802
Stop! Stop! Don't shoot!

459
00:38:50,882 --> 00:38:52,210
Truth is, Harry...

460
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:54,342
I'm scared to fire this at you.

461
00:38:54,402 --> 00:38:56,482
<i>I mean who knows
what would happen if I did.</i>

462
00:38:56,562 --> 00:38:58,122
<i>Even though I am a crack shot,</i>

463
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:00,022
it'd probably miss you by an inch,

464
00:39:00,102 --> 00:39:01,982
bounce off the floor
and end up in my gullet!

465
00:39:02,322 --> 00:39:05,402
Or worse, gun could explode in my face.

466
00:39:06,042 --> 00:39:06,962
Please.

467
00:39:08,362 --> 00:39:09,442
Let them go.

468
00:39:10,442 --> 00:39:11,802
I'll do whatever you want.

469
00:39:12,082 --> 00:39:13,362
No, you won't.

470
00:39:13,562 --> 00:39:15,162
Haven't you figured that out yet?

471
00:39:15,762 --> 00:39:16,842
<i>What?</i>

472
00:39:17,042 --> 00:39:19,062
The bracelet won't let you!

473
00:39:19,882 --> 00:39:21,462
<i>It protects your life,</i>

474
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:23,162
in every way that it can.

475
00:39:23,282 --> 00:39:26,762
It influences your choices.
It is the ultimate survivor.

476
00:39:26,842 --> 00:39:29,392
That's why dad chose
the highest building in London

477
00:39:29,482 --> 00:39:32,962
and why YOU are going to put
this gun in your mouth...

478
00:39:35,882 --> 00:39:37,122
and pull the trigger.

479
00:39:40,922 --> 00:39:41,942
<i>No!</i>

480
00:39:50,022 --> 00:39:50,942
<i>Ah!</i>

481
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,102
No!

482
00:40:14,402 --> 00:40:15,322
Give me the key.

483
00:40:15,522 --> 00:40:16,602
- Shoot yourself,
- Please!

484
00:40:16,682 --> 00:40:18,962
- and I'll let her live.
- Please, just give me the key!

485
00:40:21,242 --> 00:40:23,002
You're running out of time
to save her, Harry.

486
00:40:23,322 --> 00:40:25,242
PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH
AND PULL THE TRIGGER!

487
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:26,202
OK.

488
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,642
DO IT!

489
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,002
Harry!

490
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:13,882
Police!
Get down! On the ground, now!

491
00:41:23,362 --> 00:41:25,762
Julian! Don't move!

492
00:41:27,122 --> 00:41:29,202
I've got the Claytons.
Let's go after Julian!

493
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:31,322
<i>Daisy!</i>

494
00:41:35,922 --> 00:41:37,962
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>

495
00:41:38,042 --> 00:41:39,802
One, two, three, four, five.

496
00:41:40,642 --> 00:41:41,402
Come on, Daisy!

497
00:41:43,522 --> 00:41:45,442
<i>- Come on!</i>
- Please, wake up.

498
00:41:45,642 --> 00:41:47,162
<i>Wake up, come on!</i>

499
00:41:47,242 --> 00:41:49,522
Work for me!
Please, work for me!

500
00:41:50,122 --> 00:41:52,162
<i>One, two, three, four, five.</i>

501
00:41:52,242 --> 00:41:53,282
Please, wake up.

502
00:41:56,522 --> 00:41:57,882
Daisy! Daisy!

503
00:42:02,642 --> 00:42:03,702
I love you, God!

504
00:41:40,394 --> 00:41:44,200
