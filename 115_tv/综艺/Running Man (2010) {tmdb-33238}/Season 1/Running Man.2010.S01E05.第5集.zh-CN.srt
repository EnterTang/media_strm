1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,630
remember -- stick to the plan.

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,410
there's only two of them.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,180
we got the element of surprise.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,970
we take 'em out with overwhelmin' force.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,370
overwhelmin' force. got it. okay.

6
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:15,660
on three.

7
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,620
<i>uno,dos,tres.</i>

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,250
shoot them!

9
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,200
45 HOURS EARLIER.

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,220
TRIAL OF WAYNE YOUNG

11
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,710
detective stark?

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,310
excuse me.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,320
do you see the man who was driving the truck in this courtroom?

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,600
y-yeah. that guy right there.

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,030
CASE #4436

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,470
DRUG TRAFFICKING

17
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,480
let the record indicate detective stark has pointed out the defendant,

18
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,700
mr. wayne young.

19
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,780
and he is the one that you pulled over on the 12th?

20
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,600
- am i under oath? 
- yes.

21
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,940
i would appreciate it if you would stop asking that question.

22
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,900
is mr. young the one that you pulled over on the 12th?

23
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:12,910
he was,uh,driving a,uh,pickup truck with a plate that was stolen off a dump truck in waco.

24
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,190
so i-i busted him...for drivin'...with stolen plates.

25
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,290
no further questions,your honor.

26
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,590
detective,how exactly did you get the information

27
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,610
that the plates were stolen off of a dump truck in waco?

28
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,000
a-am i <i>still</i> under oath?

29
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,720
you are still under oath,yes.

30
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,000
i didn't know if we had to do it again.

31
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,010
isn't it true that you used,shall we say,

32
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,670
unconventional methods to obtain this information?

33
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,450
we have subpoenaed a surveillance video of you questioning mr. young's business partner.

34
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,230
but maybe you could save us all some time,detective,and just tell us what happened.

35
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,210
3 MONTHS EARLIER.

36
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,840
paco: what? what?!

37
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,400
you know what this is,you son of a bitch?!

38
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,270
what? it's a bomb.

39
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,780
you've got 30 seconds to tell me what you know about wayne young's truck,

40
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,110
or you're gonna lose everything south of your belt buckle.

41
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,730
it wasn't really a bomb.

42
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,350
you just -- you take the back off a transistor radio

43
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,700
and it looks kind of,you know,

44
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,170
bomb-ish.

45
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,000
it was kind of like a "no blood,no foul" kind of thing.

46
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,720
"no blood,no foul"

47
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,930
is hardly legal doctrine,detective.

48
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,950
even claiming to possess a bomb is a clear physical threat,

49
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,630
an egregious violation of due process.

50
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,560
i think your shirt is egregious.

51
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,680
your honor,we move for a dismissal.

52
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,940
look,liz,i don't know what to say here.

53
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,050
he is your partner,jack.

54
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,220
and i fail to see how you could allow him to leave out the bomb-down-the-pants part of his story!

55
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,210
wh-- i didn't know.

56
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,390
are you asking me to predict the behavior of a man

57
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,990
who uses his service revolver to open a mayonnaise jar?

58
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,640
that's not good enough,jack.

59
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,280
we've been trying to take down wayne young for years.

60
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,440
- l-liz,i --
- jack,what are you gonna say?

61
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,800
i need to be alone.

62
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,790
you want a chip?

63
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,970
no,i don't want a <i>chip,</i> dan.

64
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,970
you sure? they're barbecue.

65
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,190
i think the -- the dust they put on it makes you feel better.

66
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,480
you blew the case,dan --

67
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,630
not just <i>our</i> case,

68
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,730
the one that i spent a week filing the paperwork for,

69
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,920
but the <i>state's</i> case.

70
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,460
you mean your ex-girlfriend's case.

71
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,910
don't worry. we'll get him next time.

72
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,880
no. there isn't going to <i>be</i> <i>a next time,dan.</i>

73
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,340
they're shutting down the investigation.

74
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,540
that means no more department resources.

75
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,340
department resources?

76
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,100
back in the day,

77
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,740
we didn't need department resources.

78
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,820
frank and me would hit the <i>street!</i> <i>and what?</i>

79
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,380
fight crime with pointed sticks and rocks?

80
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,050
you need resources to run an investigation.

81
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:30,840
tell you what.

82
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,580
i'll take him down with the cash in my pocket --

83
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,080
three dollars...

84
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,790
and...

85
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,650
52 cents.

86
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,130
good luck with that.

87
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,860
you watch.

88
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:48,390
wayne will be back in jail before the ink on his release papers is dry.

89
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,360
wayne: y'all have a nice day,now.

90
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,050
see you in hell.

91
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,600
there he is.

92
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,950
thought you might be missing this damn right.

93
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,950
hey,you got any of that cigarette gum?

94
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,310
i ain't been thinkin' straight since i gave up cancer sticks.

95
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,820
there we go.

96
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,240
all right,we got to run a couple errands.

97
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,740
first,i got to pick me up a shotgun.

98
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,490
paco: y-you got this all wrong!

99
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,330
you're misunderstanding the situation!

100
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,100
yeah? 'cause i think the <i>situation's</i> real clear.

101
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,280
some cop put a transistor radio down your pants,

102
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,310
and you rolled over on me,paco.

103
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,170
as soon as he did that,

104
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,470
i knew that anything i said was gonna get thrown out of court.

105
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,290
i-it w-was like a strategy... to get you out of jail!

106
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,860
please! wait! just listen to me!

107
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,210
i got a deal goin' -- w-while you were in the joint.

108
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,600
it's a deal for both of us.

109
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,130
what kind of deal?

110
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,330
it's a brick of "h."

111
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,990
it's straight out of south america.

112
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,620
i brought it in on one of our trucks.

113
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,060
i got a buyer lined up and everything.

114
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,290
and that's just the start.

115
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,530
if this works,we bring in more bricks.

116
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,180
wayne,we're so close on this!

117
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,690
you meet the guy,we make delivery.

118
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,850
what about the cops?

119
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,960
t-they can't come pick you up the day after you get out!

120
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,230
the cops aren't gonna be doing anything!

121
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,420
i'm telling you,man -- we're gonna be getting rich

122
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,570
while the cops are sitting around eating donuts!

123
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,410
hard day?

124
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:11,850
yeah.

125
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,180
is it a girl,or is it work?

126
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,140
well,it's... it's both,actually.

127
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,970
my ex-girlfriend hates me,

128
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,710
and my partner at work <i>might</i> be...

129
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,310
mildly insane.

130
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,250
well,usually the answer to girl trouble

131
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,770
is to <i>do</i> something mildly insane.

132
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,200
put your problems together. maybe you've got something.

133
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,080
all right,detective bailey.

134
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,560
you're gonna need that second donut.

135
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,590
DALLAS METRO MALL
PARKING LOT D

136
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,260
jack: hey,dan.

137
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,130
hey. what's up? 

138
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,480
i want to know if you're really serious about taking wayne down,

139
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,430
aside from the whole $3.52 thing.

140
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,920
hell,yeah. why?

141
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,850
i'm gonna go talk with liz in the morning about it.

142
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,590
uh,yeah,yeah. that's a good idea. you go for it.

143
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,710
are you okay? you sound winded.

144
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,670
i'm -- i'm joggin'.

145
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,810
i got to call you back.

146
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,880
freeze!

147
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,050
julius: okay! okay.

148
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,530
- freeze!
- i'm froze!

149
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,920
i'm froze! look. i'm not moving,okay?

150
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,300
man...why you got to hassle <i>me?</i>

151
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,350
julius...

152
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,260
the relationship between a detective and a snitch

153
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,830
is a sacred bond.

154
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,100
and when you don't return my calls,

155
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,410
you make me chase you out of parking garages,

156
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,180
you violate that sacred bond.

157
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,560
listen -- i got like three warrants out for my arrest.

158
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,150
calling back cops is not really on my to-do list.

159
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,830
that's what i want to talk to you about.

160
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,530
how would you feel if all those warrants went away?

161
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,730
wait -- are you serious?

162
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:45,820
like,"went away," like,

163
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,290
"julius,you don't have to go to prison" went away?

164
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,440
uh,because that sounds appealing to me.

165
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,250
"went away," like,"you put an ankle bracelet on and you're on probation" go away.

166
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,880
i'm your man. let's lay it on me.

167
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,100
i need to know about a guy named wayne young.

168
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,250
i know him. i know wayne young.

169
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,670
oh,i don't <i>know</i> him,know him, but i do know people that know him.

170
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,890
if i could ju-- emm,can i put my hands --

171
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,640
what do you want?

172
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,960
- i just want to get some paper and a pen and write down 
- do it. do it. do it. do it.

173
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:10,970
okay -- wayne young.

174
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:15,350
he got a place,uh,down on oakwood,okay?

175
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,180
and that's it right there.

176
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,980
that make us good?

177
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,180
we put him in jail...

178
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,000
we're good.

179
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,070
okay.

180
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,300
ca-- do i have to be still? or can i move?

181
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,240
'cause i want to hug you right now.

182
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,400
you can hug me.

183
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,540
- i can hug you? 
- sure.

184
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,550
all right.thank you. thank you so much,man.

185
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,000
- i'm not gonna let you down. 
- weird. weird. feels weird.

186
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,100
oh,okay. all right. you smell like a...

187
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,120
like a man.

188
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,270
- okay. 
- okay.

189
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,230
- walk away. 
- okay.

CONVICTION RATE;75% 69%

194
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,790
what can i do for you,jack?

195
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,830
i-i-i just came by to apologize <i>again</i>

196
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,320
for dan tanking your big case.

197
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,470
well,since y'all are partners,

198
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,540
i guess you <i>both</i> tanked my case...

199
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,600
technically.

200
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:38,950
yeah,listen -- about that,um...

201
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,240
i want to make this right. i want to go after wayne.

202
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,600
now,i was talking with dan,and,uh --

203
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,420
after what <i>dan</i> did,

204
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,930
you're gonna have to catch him in the act

205
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,050
committing a major felony.

206
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,620
that means doing everything by the book --

207
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,800
not really your partner's strong suit.

208
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,040
matter of fact,i might just leave him at home on this one.

209
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:54,870
don't worry about it.

210
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,990
just fill me in on the case against wayne --

211
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,140
his full history,just <i>something</i> that i can go after him with.

212
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:00,940
fine.

213
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,530
provided you leave my office immediately

214
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,550
so that i can get some work done,

215
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,740
i will meet you at your office at 6:00.

216
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,670
dan: you having fun reading your <i>files,</i>

217
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,520
or you ready to go bust this punk?

218
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,780
look,i hate to blow your mind,

219
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,690
but in these files are pieces of paper.

220
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,670
and if you read them,

221
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,650
they actually tell you things about the case.

222
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,070
oh,yeah? read <i>this</i> file.

223
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,600
wayne's working out of a garage in east dallas.

224
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,140
runs it through some kind of shell company.

225
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,430
okay. it's nice.

226
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,900
but what do we bust him for?

227
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,920
- figure it out when we get there.
- no,dan.

228
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:33,910
if we're gonna bust wayne,

229
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,180
we have to do things by the book.

230
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,060
fine -- you want to do it by the book,we'll do it by the book.

231
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,120
we'll go there and do a whatchamacallit --

232
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:43,180
a "preliminary investigation."

233
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,080
yeah,that'll work.

234
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,690
by the way,

235
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,240
how did you find out where wayne was operating?

236
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,670
am -- am i still under oath?

237
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,570
G.T STONE'S TRUCK DEPOT
ACTUAL OWNER:WAYNE YOUNG

238
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,620
this is the place.

239
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,440
that's weird.

240
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,510
what do you say we go in there and check out that truck?

241
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:14,740
w-whoa -- whoa -- maybe i wasn't clear about the whole "by the book" thing.

242
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,330
searching a place without a warrant --

243
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,630
that's not in the book,dan.

244
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:19,430
well,how about this?

245
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:25,160
secondary exits must be unlocked during business hours.

246
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:29,380
i say,as officers of the law,it is our duty...

247
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,740
to enter the premises and cite the owner.

248
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,140
hit him with a city violation?

249
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,650
besides,they should know their security is terrible.

250
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,190
plus,nobody should be allowed back here without a hard hat.

251
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,300
you mean like us?

252
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,250
hey,it's a violation.

253
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:50,810
we should tell the owner about it right after we ding him for that improperly secured propane tank.

254
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,220
y-you know,that's not really in the spirit of what i was saying,dan.

255
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,370
well,it's legal,doesn't cost more than $3.52,so it works for me.

256
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,730
see,the law is like a woman --

257
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,000
she slaps you,doesn't do any good to get mad.

258
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,530
it just makes it worse.

259
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:03,570
a little sweet talk,

260
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,390
before you know it,you're covered with baby oil,

261
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,470
whipped cream on your nipples --

262
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,260
okay,yeah,yeah,yeah. i get it. i get it.

263
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,400
what is this place? what are they shipping here?

264
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,010
there's no way to tell,but --

265
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,460
well,maybe we'd better check out that truck,

266
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,850
make sure their cargo is properly secured.

267
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,660
no,wait. dan,wait!

268
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,950
i've got to call liz.

269
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,290
hey,jack. what's up?

270
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:29,020
uh,listen -- i'm gonna be a little late for our meeting.

271
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,190
why? what's wrong?

272
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,200
oh,no,no. i-it's nothing.

273
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,040
it's just,um...

274
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,550
you sound like a 14-year-old trying to hide a girlie magazine.

275
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,350
sorry,liz. uh,l-listen.

276
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,120
c-can we meet at 6:30? is that okay?

277
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,700
that's fine. i'll see you then.

278
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,470
okay. thanks.

279
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,440
dan,what are you doing?

280
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,140
dan,we can't be in here.

281
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,130
why not? looks illegal.

282
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,600
what part of this looks illegal to you,dan?

283
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,960
all right? this is a truck filled with boxes.

284
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,160
yeah. boxes full of <i>crime.</i>

285
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,900
oh. okay. well,that's a good one for the report.

286
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,270
"detective stark made a visual inspection

287
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,970
and determined that the boxes were filled with <i>crime."</i>

288
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,640
come on. we're on the five-yard line.

289
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,890
i can feel it tinglin' in my loins!

290
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,480
that's another gem for the report.

291
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,220
listen,dan.

292
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,320
we are off to a great start here,okay?

293
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,810
now,if we can just determine that this is young's place of business,

294
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:26,920
then we've got a pretty good case for probable cause,but not if w--

295
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,270
did you hear somethin'?

296
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,960
yeah,i heard that -- sounds like a door.

297
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,560
wayne: start her up. i'll get the back.

298
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,110
dan,this is an illegal search,all right?!

299
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,380
now,if we get caught,we are in serious trouble!

300
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,470
your phone is ringing.

301
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,610
god!

302
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,270
i hate this.

303
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,580
hello.

304
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,470
hey,detective dan. this is julius,man.

305
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,090
how is the,uh,parole deal coming?

306
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,240
hey,i can't talk right now.

307
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,770
i'm in the back of wayne young's truck.

308
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:58,420
w-wait -- w-what are you doing in the back of one of wayne young's trucks?

309
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,560
h-hello? dan?

310
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,350
it's a long story.

311
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:09,410
t-there's men with big guns,and --

312
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,850
it's beepin'. i can't hear anything.

313
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,490
but it's beepin'. what does that mean?

314
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,440
no. no,no,no. this cannot be happening to me.

315
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,620
i got to hand it to you,paco.

316
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,630
looks like it's working out real good.

317
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,130
aren't you glad you didn't blow my head off with that shotgun?

318
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:31,370
just a little misunderstanding between partners,right?

319
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,860
yeah.

320
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,620
come on. let's go make some money.

321
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,580
oh,god. it's moving. the truck is moving.

322
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,740
oh,god,i cannot believe i let you talk me into this.

323
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,070
yeah,i can't either.

324
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,930
damn!

325
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:12,530
oh,skeeter. skeeter! my man.

326
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,580
- what the hell?!what's going on,man?!
- thank you for coming. 

327
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,190
i got your call. i thought you were dying!

328
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:21,700
i <i>am</i> dying,skeeter. i'm like <i>inches</i> from dying.

329
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:22,590
you look okay.

330
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,690
well,i'm not.

331
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,830
um,you know the parole deal that i made?

332
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,260
okay,the cop that i made the deal with

333
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,430
is trapped in the back of one of wayne young's trucks.

334
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,010
- what?! 
- i know.

335
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,300
there's no trucks in there!

336
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,860
i know,skeeter. that's what i'm saying.

337
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,170
look,if this cop dies,man,

338
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,900
i'm going to jail for like five years.

339
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,630
and these are very big years

340
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,250
in terms of my personal growth,okay?

341
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,670
i mean,you know,i got a girlfriend in jamaica.

342
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,910
maybe she moves back,we open up a b&b someplace.

343
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,150
okay,yeah,and i'm here <i>why?</i>

344
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,760
you introduced me to wayne young.

345
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,000
y'all are friends,so...

346
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,120
no,no,no,no,no. "friends"?

347
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:56,000
t-t-that would be a strong word.

348
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,800
we're more like colleagues,dude.

349
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:00,190
h-he takes weed up north for me sometimes.

350
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,760
okay,but you <i>know</i> him. you know him better than i do.

351
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,460
all right,look -- skeeter,baby,

352
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,170
you got to find this truck,and you got to find it now,man.

353
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,710
look,i'll give you $500.

354
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,460
$500?! what,are you out of your mind?!

355
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,910
that guy's violent,dude!

356
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,980
he -- he pulled a guy's thumbs off,man!

357
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:18,090
h-he had,like,no -- just,like,<i>fingers</i> left!

358
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,790
it was t-t-totally disgusting,dude!

359
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,440
okay. okay. i will give you...

360
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,690
my car.

361
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,710
no,man. no!

362
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,020
i like this car.

363
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,310
comes with the stereo?

364
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,830
mm-hmm. you can have the stereo.

365
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:43,130
- and the rims? 
- you can have the rims.you can have the stereo. 

366
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:46,070
you can have the floor mats.you can have the change in the ashtray,skeeter.

367
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,690
just find the truck for me,okay?!

368
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,490
i'm a dead man.

369
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,820
i'm a dead man.

370
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,660
all right,i'll help find the truck.

371
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,990
okay. thank you.

372
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,390
i'm sorry. i didn't mean to yell at you.

373
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:03,740
wayne: still don't see why we need a whole 18-wheeler to move one little,ol' brick of heroin.

374
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,260
that's the genius of it.

375
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,120
they been amping up searches at the border,

376
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:10,100
but,uh,they only do spot-checks,see?

377
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,600
t-they don't check your whole cargo.

378
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,270
yeah,they might open up 1 box,you know,maybe 10,

379
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,330
but trust me --

380
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,070
they ain't gonna open up 200.

381
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,990
what the hell was that?

382
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,720
ain't you jumpy.

383
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,770
it's the truck...

384
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:25,890
backfirin'.

385
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,050
30 SECONDS EARLIER.

386
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,410
sounds like we're on a two-lane highway in a flat,rural area.

387
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,590
dan,this is <i>texas,</i> <i>all right?</i>

388
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,880
you just described 10,000 square miles.

389
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:42,160
oh,god damn it! are you insane?! stop that!

390
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,950
i'm trying to put a hole in the wall

391
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,560
so the cellphone-wavey-thingys can get out.

392
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,050
dan,the phones aren't working because these walls are made with reinforced steel.

393
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,340
so if you <i>shoot</i> at them,

394
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,080
the only thing you're gonna put a hole in...is one of us!

395
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:55,850
okay. fine.

396
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,540
then let's get these doors open so we can jump out.

397
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,480
oh,god. yeah. that's a <i>great</i> idea.

398
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,280
why don't we jump out of a moving truck

399
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,100
at 75 miles per hour and land on the asphalt.

400
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,260
what's wrong with that?

401
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,880
physics,dan. it's suicide.

402
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,570
not if you push off hard enough from the truck.

403
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,560
it cancels out the speed of the truck.

404
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,700
look,it's like when you're in an elevator,

405
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,390
and when it comes to a stop,

406
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,610
you jump.

407
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,560
i-i'll tell you what -- if you can get the door open,

408
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,490
why don't you just show me how it works,okay?

409
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,210
come on.

410
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,040
why are you acting like this is such a bad thing?

411
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,610
we got wayne young right where we want him.

412
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,400
yeah.

413
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,100
on a two-lane highway in a flat,rural area.

414
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,450
exactly.

415
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,240
<i>jack:</i> <i>this is detective jack bailey.</i>

416
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,620
<i>please leave a message,</i> <i>and i'll get right back to you.</i>

417
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,710
well,it has been 45 minutes. congratulations.

418
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,830
you are officially on your way to becoming your partner.

419
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,700
still waiting on your boyfriend?

420
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,370
detective bailey's not my boyfriend.

421
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:03,400
and unless you want me asking my office to make you redo all those arrest reports in blue ink instead of black,

422
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,130
i will thank you to keep your mouth shut about that.

423
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,630
oh,jack.

424
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,520
wherever you are,i hope you are having fun.

425
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,790
man: okay,man. all i know is,it's down south somewhere.

426
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,840
julius: how you doin'?

427
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:33,810
man,what took you so long?

428
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,590
man,i'm,like -- i'm,like,freakin' out in this neighborhood.

429
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,830
dude,you asked me to find out about a <i>criminal,</i> all right?

430
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,570
most criminals live in areas with low median property values...

431
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,950
- and crime.
- can we just focus,please?

432
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,250
where is the truck with the cop in it?

433
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,030
west.

434
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,130
west.

435
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,760
what does -- i don't -- what does that mean?

436
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,920
well,it means that i talked to my buddy over there

437
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,360
and he heard that wayne and some other guy

438
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,370
are going out west on the interstate.

439
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:00,680
he didn't know where,but it's definitely...out...

440
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,550
you know,that way.

441
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,830
so i'm supposed to just drive that way?

442
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,050
what's going on that way?

443
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,390
i'm working on details.

444
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,260
oh,man,you --

445
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:11,190
all right,i-i-i guess they're doing a deal with some guy.

446
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,040
"with some guy"? man,you're killing me.

447
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,270
you are absolutely killing me,man.

448
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:15,140
do you know anything else?

449
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,330
i hear that he's kind of scary looking...

450
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,780
and he's from another country.

451
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,950
we can do the deal on thursday.

459
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,760
i'll call you when i know more,man.

460

what? no,no,no,no,no,no,no.

462
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,880
coming with you wasn't part of the initial agreement.

463
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,600
hey. hey. i'm giving you my car,man.

466
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,420
yeah,i want the car.

467
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,940

00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,010
i mean,you would have done the same for me.

477
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,260
oh,sure thing. sure thing.

478
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,150
got any other deals in the works?

479
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,770
anything else i should know about?

480
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:38,060
i got a few things... brewin'.

481
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,680
jack: oh,man.

482
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,540
dan,what are you doing?

483
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,960
i am trying to cut a hole with my knife

484
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,050
so that the cellphone- wavey-thingys can run free,

485
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:53,100
because of your fear of the ricochet.

486
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:59,770
you're trying to cut a hole in a bulletproof steel wall with a pocket knife.

487
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,650
good luck with that.

488
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,010
i'll finish it later.

489
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,370
what are you doing?

490
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,270
aside from trying not to get carsick?

491
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:14,000
i...am investigating wayne young's inventory.

492
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,780
thought you said those boxes were filled with scented candles.

493
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,560
well,so far.

494
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,300
i haven't opened all of them yet.

495
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:22,710
are you looking for a particular fragrance?

496
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:25,260
let me ask you something,dan.

497
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,260
what do you think is more likely --

498
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,070
that wayne young is opening a scented-candle shop,

499
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,670
or he's trying to hide something...

500
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,900
something that a drug-sniffing dog would be able to find.

501
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,640
like i said,these boxes are full of <i>crime.</i>

502
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,660
yeah,well...

503
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,200
you mind helping me out here?

504
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:47,090
get a little more light on the situation.

505
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,510
mystic sunrise.

506
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:53,110
it's <i>natural.</i>

507
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,510
i love it.

508
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,680
julius: don't die on me,dan.

509
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:00,080
do not die on me,dan. do not die on me,dan.

510
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,370
dude,will you shut up?!i'm trying to talk on the phone!

511
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,870
all right. cool,man. thank you.

512
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,380
okay. so,did you find out where the hell we're going?

513
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:17,510
sort of.my buddy heard that the deal's going down tomorrow morning at 7:30

514
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,370
by the,uh... the -- the --

515
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,380
the "lil' tradin' post curio shop," by lubbock.

516
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,170
the lil' tradin' -- w-w-what?

517
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:24,960
i don't know,man.

518
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,680
it's like a souvenir shop or somethin'.

519
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,700
also,um...

520
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,110
oh,god.

521
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,370
also what? what? what? what? what? what? what?

522
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,550
i found out a little bit more about that south african guy.

523
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:40,310
i guess he's doing some kind of big drug deal

524
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,690
with wayne young,and i guess he...

525
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,840
bought a lot of guns.

526
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:44,900
perfect.

527
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,420
i'm thinkin' maybe we should just turn around,

528
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,200
go home.

529
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,630
skeeter,if this cop dies,

530
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:53,450
i'm sleepin' 18 inches from a metal toilet for the next half-decade,okay?

531
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,040
just focus on finding out where this deal is happening.

532
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,290
and,skeeter,when we get there,

533
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,520
you look for the cop with the moustache,okay?

534
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,120
everybody can shoot each other up,

535
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,940
but we save the moustache.

536
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,490
- save the moustache. 
- save the moustache.

537
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,360
the scent of these candles is getting to me.

538
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,330
what? it smells like a mystic sunrise.

539
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,970
oh,god. i think i'm gonna puke.

540
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,200
well,if you're gonna puke,i'm gonna light more candles.

541
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,680
no! no! no!

542
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,310
ooh,ooh! look at you.

543
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,100
i believe we have hit the...

544
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,130
jackpot.

545
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,160
give me that.

546
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,880
this is 3 kilos,at least.

547
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,170
it's heroin.

548
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,160
it's heroin. it's -- it's high-density.

549
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,920
it's,uh,small grains.

550
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,080
it's probably,uh,central asian.

551
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,210
wow,you sure do know a lot about that heroin...

552
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,030
thank you.

553
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,600
that heroin that we never would have found

554
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:47,540
if i hadn't arranged to get us locked up together in the back of this truck.

555
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,990
so,you're saying you planned this?

556
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,550
i'm saying that bein' a cop is a team sport.

557
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,120
it's you and me,jack.

558
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:57,240
you know,in the old days,we used to catch a bad guy --

559
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,670
we'd call all our buddies,we'd let him go,

560
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:00,700
we'd catch him again,

561
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,800
just so we could bust him together.

562
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:03,620
are you serious?

563
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,880
yeah. we called it "catch,release,and catch again."

564
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:09,120
look,you got to understand the difference between the good guys and the bad guys.

565
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,450
bad guys are just a bunch of guys runnin' around with guns.

566
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,490
good guys are a <i>team</i> of guys runnin' around with guns.

567
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:22,620
you learn that,maybe you won't spend the rest of your career working property crimes with dan stark.

568
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,860
thanks for the career advice.

569
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,920
hey,listen,dan...

570
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:31,200
what?

571
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,610
the truck is stopping.

572
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,370
LIL' TRADIN' POST CURIO SHOP
ONE INCONVENIENT LOCATION

573
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,740
wayne: why the hell we get here so damn early?

574
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:43,730
take the side roads just to be safe -- i told you.

575
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,510
and why the hell did we pick a drop location way the hell out here?

576
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:49,080
- we're totally exposed. 
- no,it's perfect.

577
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,830
this little town is between districts.

578
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:53,750
i mean,it's at least 100 miles to the nearest cop.

579
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,590
there's no way we can get caught.

580
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,340
nobody even knows we're here.

581
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:02,770
oh. shotgun? there's not gonna be any need for that.

582
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:05,140
it's just in case.

583
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,670
paco: hey,there.

584
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,790
don't worry about the guys with the guns.

585
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,690
mikkel likes to travel heavy,just in case.

586
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,900
oh,i ain't worried.

587
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,550
good to see you.

588
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,610
looks like we got a little business to conduct.

589
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,530
put the shotgun down.

590
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,630
get on your knees.

591
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,100
excuse me?

592
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:41,660
i said,"get on your knees."

593
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,310
whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa there,cowboy.

594
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,950
this ain't what we ta--

595
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,650
what the hell is going on?!

596
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:49,880
sorry,wayne.

597
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:53,410
i guess i forgot to mention me and mikkel had sort of a side deal.

598
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,400
28 HOURS EARLIER.

599
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,450
PACO'S APARTMENT

600
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,120
yeah,man. i got the product.

601
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,130
so,how 'bout this -- we do the deal,

602
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,570
only...

603
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:03,720
you kill wayne.

604
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,400
no more wayne,it's win-win.

605
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:14,540
i had a side deal,you stupid son of a bitch!

606
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:17,440
26 HOURS EARLIER.

607
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:18,890
SILVER BOOT DINER

608
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,850
how 'bout this -- we deliver the brick of heroin,

609
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,110
i take care of paco,

610
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,130
and all you got to bring is a shovel.

611
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,340
win-win.

612
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:28,370
exactly.

613
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,880
what?

614
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:32,320
you also. get on your knees now.

615
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,150
okay. okay.

616
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,690
uh,i think there's been some confusion here,

617
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,850
in terms of the agreement.

618
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,640
there is no confusion.

619
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:43,770
25.5 HOURS EARLIER.

620
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:46,830
SILVER BOOT DINER

621
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,510
how was the meeting?

622
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,390
both are unreliable.

623
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:56,050
best we,uh,kill them and take their product.

624
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,900
weasel son of a bitch. i should have killed you when i had the chance.

625
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,710
paco: actually,maybe it would be better

626
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,740
if you didn't try to kill me at all.

627
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,100
the only reason we're in this situation is because you were gonna shoot me.

628
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,610
oh,no -- the reason we're in this situation is 'cause you talked to the cops like a damn weasel!

629
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:12,180
enough!

630
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,860
let's finish this now.

631
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:16,590
let's get the brick of heroin and get out of here.

632
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:19,730
open the truck.

633
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,750
you smell that?

634
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,320
come on! come on!

635
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,000
remember -- stick to the plan.

636
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,750
there's only two of 'em.

637
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,580
we got the element of surprise.

638
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,350
we take 'em out with overwhelmin' force.

639
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:44,410
overwhelmin' force. got it.

640
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,880
go!

641
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,220
what the hell?

642
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,780
you got a plan "b"?!

643
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,220
let's go!

644
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,020
shoot them!

645
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:14,230
traitor weasel son of a bitch!

646
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:21,060
i'm not liking plan "b"!

647
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:30,120
little early for you to visit us,isn't it,counselor?

648
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,220
i heard about the dan stark courtroom fiasco,

649
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,210
and if you're here to tell me he's an idiot,let me save you a little time.

650
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,900
actually,i'm not here about that --

651
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,650
- not directly,anyway.
- what is it?

652
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:41,230
it's about j-- it's about detective bailey.

653
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:45,210
uh,we were supposed to meet to go over some evidence last night,and he never showed.

654
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,820
oh,he's probably fishing dan out of whatever hole he slept in last night.

655
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,250
check the steam vents at the larson hospital and the urinals at the strip club.

656
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,740
he usually passes out somewhere warm.

657
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:55,070
if you don't mind my saying,lieutenant,

658
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,600
i don't think that's where he is.

659
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,740
i found an address on his desk last night,

660
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,370
and i spent all night tracking it down,

661
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:07,630
and it turns out that it belongs to a trucking company with ties to wayne young.

662
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,160
jamie,when's the last time dan stark or jack bailey checked in?

663
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:24,430
keep 'em coming!

664
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,660
i got enough buckshot for all y'all!

665
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:41,320
we had a deal!

666
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,460
man: afternoon.

667
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,710
looks like you're having a little bit of trouble out there.

668
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,080
oh,it's not as bad as it looks.

669
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:52,560
i think we're all clear now.

670
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:10,930
don't ever say "all clear" again!

671
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:20,110
let's go!

672
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:25,350
who the hell are those two guys?

673
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,110
i don't know,and i don't care.

674
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,980
just kill them and get me that brick.

675
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,810
cover me in the front.

676
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,330
i got to call the lieutenant and call for backup.

677
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:37,570
lieutenant ruiz.

678
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,100
yes,lieutenant! this is detective bailey!

679
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,590
you haven't checked in in the last six hours.

680
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:42,600
where the hell have you been?!

681
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,760
it is a long story,all right?

682
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:47,250
just -- det-- detective stark and i need cover.

683
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,610
send 'em code 3 -- as many squads as you can!

684
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,270
- i'll get dispatch. 
- no,no,no,no,no!

685
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:58,890
we don't -- we don't need backup from,uh,from our substation or -- or dallas p.d. at all,for that matter.

686
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,160
we're at the...

687
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:03,200
the "lil' tradin' post curio shop."

688
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:06,360
it's,uh... it's about -- damn it --

689
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,080
30 minutes outside of lubbock.

690
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,990
all right,now,we're under heavy fire!

691
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,460
that's six hours away,detective.

692
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:13,840
what the hell are you doing out there?

693
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,220
it is a long story,all right?

694
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,090
just send as many people as you can,all right?

695
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,600
- hurry! 
- all right,i'll get dispatch.

696
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:23,950
and,detective -- i'll want a full explanation of how you came to be "under heavy fire" at the lil' tradin' post curio shop!

697
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:26,250
yes! and you will get it,lieutenant!

698
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,390
i promise you that!

699
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,340
we are so late,man. we are <i>so</i> late.

700
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,550
the stupid deal was supposed to happen five minutes ago,man.

701
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:34,920
where is this place at?

702
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,130
it should be right up here.

703
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,960
<i>should</i> be? man,<i>should</i> be or <i>is?</i>

704
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,000
man,come on.

705
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,090
i-it should be,dude. it's hard to tell.

706
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,650
i-i-is it right here?

707
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,630
yes.

708
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,450
no,no,no,no,no,no,no. no. no.

709
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,470
it's back that way.

710
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,880
the road we just passed.

711
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:58,210
this is not a safe way to drive!

712
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,960
you know what? learn to read a map.<i>then</i> you comment on my driving.

713
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,140
backup's 20 minutes away,at least.

714
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,140
at the rate we're going,we're gonna be dead in 10,give or take a minute or two.

715
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:13,350
that sounds about right.

716
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,630
we got to bring the bad guys to the backup.

717
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,750
if they see us run out of here with this brick,

718
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,130
they're gonna follow us.

719
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:21,400
we'll meet up with the cavalry en route.

720
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:22,850
that's a good idea,dan.

721
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,160
or it would be,

722
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:29,180
if we had any mode of transportation at all and we weren't getting shot at.

723
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,310
way ahead of you. take a look!

724
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,890
- we'll take the red one. 
- that a boy.

725
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:43,350
you're gonna die,it might as well be in a hot rod!

726
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,190
you ready?!

727
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,070
i'm waiting for you to say "go."

728
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,050
let's go!

729
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:57,140
go,go,go,go,go,go,go,go,go!

730
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,800
i got it! where are the keys?! how am i supposed to drive?!

731
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,970
you don't know how to hot-wire a car?!

732
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,670
what the hell they teach you at the academy?

733
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,250
get out! 

734
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,080
go!

735
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,060
go,go,go,go!

736
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,280
son of a bitch!

737
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:22,500
you! is that your car? give me the keys.

738
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:48,890
you make this thing go any faster?!

739
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,700
got a small-block v-8 in this!

740
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:55,430
yeah,i know,but there's a reason why it was sitting collecting dust in front of a souvenir shop,all right?

741
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:58,350
the transmission's shot!

742
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:04,780
i'm thinking maybe we should have took the sedan.

743
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,220
you want some?

744
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,980
dan,when did you get a chocolate bar?

745
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:20,090
i got it back at the shop when you were on the phone.

746
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,830
i-it's got almonds...

747
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,830
...nougat...

748
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,850
it's kind of crispy. you sure you don't want a bite?

749
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:30,190
yeah. no. i'm not hungry right now!

750
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:34,180
maybe when we're finished fleeing for our survival,all right?!

751
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,540
son of a bitch!

752
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:47,680
i want that brick now!

753
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:57,130
i'm thinking this isn't a very good situation anymore!

754
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,590
what,you don't think i already know that?!

755
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,150
get some!

756
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:02,520
come on.

757
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,350
come on!

758
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,740
nice!

759
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,700
nice. that's exactly what i would have done.

760
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,580
that's what scares me.

761
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:36,170
nobody's movin'.

762
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,230
i think we're all clear.

763
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:41,360
no,i -- i told you,don't say that!

764
00:35:56,710 --> 00:36:00,800
you thought you were gonna get away with my heroin,you sons of bitches?!

765
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,840
are you seeing what i'm seeing?

766
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:05,000
it seems to be a flaming truck of some sort.

767
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,630
quick! go! go!

768
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,200
i'll grab the horse!

769
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,470
oh,no! i dropped it!

770
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:13,220
get down! get down! get down!

771
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,390
- you all right? 
- yeah,i'm fine.

772
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:27,240
but i've been better. 

773
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:32,360
bastard!

774
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,700
oh,he's getting away with the heroin.

775
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:06,550
- okay,we got to go after him. come on.
- jack.

776
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:09,200
partner,we got a bigger problem right here.

777
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:11,570
put down your guns.

778
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:14,450
where is the heroin?

779
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,020
we don't have it. it's gone.

780
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,430
- you're lying! 
- he's not lying.

781
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:21,610
we left it in the middle of the road."packo" ran off with it.

782
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:22,950
who are you?

783
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,670
why were you in the back of the truck?

784
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,900
we're police officers.

785
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:28,300
but i-i-if you just drop your weapon,

786
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,690
all,right,we can talk this out.

787
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,860
cops? you're cops?

788
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:35,850
you harm one hair on that man's moustache,and i will blow your brains all over this food stand.

789
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:36,880
are you kidding me?

790
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,310
no. i'm not.

791
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,190
julius! you made it!

792
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:45,810
of course i made it,man. we had a deal,right?

793
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:47,520
wait -- w- a deal? what deal?

794
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:50,140
i'll explain later.

795
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:53,100
can i hug you?

796
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,110
yes,you can hug me.

797
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,580
come on!

798
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,140
all right.

799
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,060
- here they come. you better get out of here.
- okay. all right. 

800
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,610
- run
- we got to go. we got to go. we got to go.

801
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:06,310
register your weapon!

802
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,590
what the hell was that?

803
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:11,170
we hugged.

804
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,880
i'm a hugger.

805
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,740
and then the other guy,the one in the cowboy hat --

806
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,980
he run off over there and he had a shotgun.

807
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:24,230
looked like a walnut stock,12 gauge.

808
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,440
anyway,he runs off over there...

809
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,870
ruiz: the freeway's still a complete mess.

810
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,200
there's no sign of paco.

811
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:33,010
i talked to the unis --they think he ran off and caught a ride on a back road.

812
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,300
and the brick of heroin?

813
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:36,790
no sign of that,either.looks like he got away with that,too.

814
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:37,960
he didn't leave any friends behind,

815
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:41,010
and wayne young has agreed to testify against him.

816
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,460
and i believe his exact words were,

817
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,530
"i'm gonna drag that little weasel to hell with me."

818
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,090
well,that's helpful.

819
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,320
yeah,but y-you know what's <i>not</i> so helpful?

820
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,470
blowing up a car

821
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:54,900
and then getting in a major gun battle 10 counties away from your substation.

822
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:59,860
so,next time you want to apprehend a suspect and it takes all this,

823
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,810
maybe you could just let me know,or something.

824
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,940
well,yeah. it wasn't really part of the plan.

825
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:06,500
it just sort of evolved.

826
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,130
well,it was a hell of a drive out here,

827
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,790
and i'm gonna get my butt chewed out for all the overtime,

828
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:14,910
but...i'm real glad you're okay.

829
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,560
you came all the way out here 'cause you were worried about me?

830
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:19,850
no.

831
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,440
i drove all this way to see wayne young in handcuffs.

832
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,180
oh. right.

833
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,380
ah,but now that i'm here,i do...owe you an apology

834
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:32,930
for leaving you that voicemail about being late and turning into dan.

835
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:34,450
and...i was just real upset about my case,

836
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,390
and i let it get in the way of me trusting you.

837
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,500
so i'm sorry for that,jack.

838
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:44,540
well,i stole a sports car and torched a semi.can we call it even?

839
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,220
no. not even close.

840
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,720
we've been,uh,questioning that south african guy.

841
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,810
you know they got giraffes down there?

842
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:56,160
he's giving us all sorts of intel on guys he's worked with --

843
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,960
drug cases,murders... it's like christmas in there.

844
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,230
dan,we lost a brick of pure <i>heroin,</i> all right?

845
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:04,550
we can hardly call it a victory.

846
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:06,350
i wouldn't say "lost."

847
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:08,970
what are you talking about?

848
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:12,630
7 HOURS EARLIER.

849
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,630
don't ever say "all clear" again!

850
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,410
cover me in the front.

851
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:25,220
i got to call the lieutenant and call for backup.

852
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:30,190
yes,lieutenant! this is detective bailey.

853
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,040
it is a long story,all right?

854
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:35,450
just -- det-- detective stark and i need cover.

855
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,440
send 'em code 3 -- as many squads as you can!

856
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:38,730
hey,old timer...

857
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,550
sorry about the shootout.

858
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:45,300
how much for this,uh,doorstop?

859
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,540
oh,that's five dollars.

860
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:49,000
it's a brick.

861
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:51,090
that's hand-painted,there.

862
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,670
i'll give you three.

863
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,540
done.

864
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,950
here you go.

865
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:58,560
that's three.

866
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:08,010
how much for one of them chocolate bars?

867
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:11,110
them candy bars is 50 cents.

868
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,640
why'd you do that?

869
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,630
i was hungry.

870
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:18,650
no,not the candy bar.

871
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,510
what made you think of switching up the bricks?

872
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,890
- well,you wanted to do it by the book,right? 
- yeah.

873
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,740
well,i had to "secure all evidence against the possibility that it may be compromised."

874
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,320
you've read the book. that's in there,right?

875
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:30,670
that it is.

876
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,200
so,let me just get this clear --

877
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,660
paco took off with a hand-painted doorstop?

878
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,080
i'm not gonna waste your time.

879
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,640
