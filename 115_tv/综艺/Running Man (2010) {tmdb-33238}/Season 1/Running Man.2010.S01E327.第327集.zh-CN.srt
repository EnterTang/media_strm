1
00:00:04,594 --> 00:00:08,464
(Seomun Market in Daegu)

2
00:00:09,664 --> 00:00:13,294
(They have various kinds of tasty food.)

3
00:00:13,964 --> 00:00:15,264
Is it only the four of us?

4
00:00:15,294 --> 00:00:16,964
That's right.

5
00:00:17,034 --> 00:00:19,464
- Jong Kook and... - It's very quiet.

6
00:00:19,464 --> 00:00:20,934
- I know. - It's better.

7
00:00:20,934 --> 00:00:23,464
- It's become much more peaceful. - Exactly.

8
00:00:23,464 --> 00:00:24,664
- Right. - That's true.

9
00:00:24,664 --> 00:00:26,394
I'm sure you feel lonely right now.

10
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:28,534
- Not at all. - What are you talking about?

11
00:00:28,864 --> 00:00:30,564
We don't feel lonely at all.

12
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:32,364
- I like this better. - Today,

13
00:00:32,464 --> 00:00:34,094
the main theme in the Bromance House.

14
00:00:34,094 --> 00:00:35,334
The Bromance House?

15
00:00:35,764 --> 00:00:38,834
Please come to the Bromance House to find the brothers.

16
00:00:38,934 --> 00:00:41,334
That's where your bromance will grow.

17
00:00:41,364 --> 00:00:43,034
- Do we have to find our brothers? - Our brothers?

18
00:00:43,034 --> 00:00:44,934
Bromance...

19
00:00:44,934 --> 00:00:46,634
(Who will they be?)

20
00:00:46,634 --> 00:00:48,564
- I think... - My brother...

21
00:00:48,564 --> 00:00:50,134
is like a superstar.

22
00:00:50,764 --> 00:00:52,934
He is very wealthy.

23
00:00:53,234 --> 00:00:55,664
Is your brother also rich?

24
00:00:55,934 --> 00:00:57,194
- He is. - I see.

25
00:00:57,194 --> 00:00:59,434
He is quite wealthy.

26
00:00:59,764 --> 00:01:02,094
Why don't all of us have a cup of coffee?

27
00:01:02,094 --> 00:01:03,294
Our brothers are very rich.

28
00:01:03,294 --> 00:01:04,334
Let's order about 20 cups of coffee.

29
00:01:05,234 --> 00:01:06,264
Hello.

30
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:08,094
I'd like to order iced coffee.

31
00:01:08,834 --> 00:01:10,364
- We need 20. - I want 20 cups of coffee.

32
00:01:10,764 --> 00:01:13,064
- Thank you. - We'll be in the next store.

33
00:01:13,764 --> 00:01:15,034
Our brothers will come and pay for this.

34
00:01:15,494 --> 00:01:17,894
Please come in. Don't worry. It's all free of charge.

35
00:01:18,034 --> 00:01:19,894
- Thank you. - This is on my brother.

36
00:01:20,234 --> 00:01:22,034
Sir, please have a bite.

37
00:01:22,664 --> 00:01:23,664
Open wide.

38
00:01:25,494 --> 00:01:27,834
(Please feel free to enjoy. Our brothers are superstars.)

39
00:01:27,934 --> 00:01:29,364
(Thank you, our brothers.)

40
00:01:29,364 --> 00:01:31,334
- Our brothers will pay for this. - Right.

41
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:32,634
It's here.

42
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,734
(There they come.)

43
00:01:33,734 --> 00:01:35,234
Hello.

44
00:01:35,464 --> 00:01:37,134
- They are over there. - What are they doing?

45
00:01:37,134 --> 00:01:40,194
(Let's see who Jae Seok and Kwang Soo's brothers are.)

46
00:01:40,894 --> 00:01:42,264
My goodness.

47
00:01:42,264 --> 00:01:44,264
(Jung Seok is Jae Seok's brother and Kyung Soo is Kwang Soo's brother.)

48
00:01:45,494 --> 00:01:47,264
- Hello. - Hello, Kyung Soo.

49
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,964
(It's a dramatic reunion in Daegu.)

50
00:01:48,964 --> 00:01:50,634
(You're having delicious food.)

51
00:01:50,634 --> 00:01:51,934
What are you eating now?

52
00:01:52,164 --> 00:01:53,964
- They're eating a lot of food. - Wait.

53
00:01:53,964 --> 00:01:55,894
- Come have a seat. - Look what they have here.

54
00:01:56,894 --> 00:01:59,394
We ordered these for everyone including the staff.

55
00:02:00,094 --> 00:02:03,334
And you and Jae Seok must pay for these.

56
00:02:04,894 --> 00:02:06,564
- We should pay for this? - Exactly.

57
00:02:06,564 --> 00:02:08,104
Jae Seok, he said it's all on us.

58
00:02:08,264 --> 00:02:09,864
We need to pay?

59
00:02:10,034 --> 00:02:14,734
We both bragged about our wealthy brothers.

60
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:16,104
- Really? - Yes.

61
00:02:16,734 --> 00:02:19,194
I can pay for this,

62
00:02:19,234 --> 00:02:20,764
but I don't have my wallet with me.

63
00:02:20,764 --> 00:02:22,104
Me neither.

64
00:02:22,264 --> 00:02:24,134
- How much is it? - They didn't say I'd need money.

65
00:02:24,364 --> 00:02:27,264
Actually, we brought your credit cards.

66
00:02:27,664 --> 00:02:29,134
- What is that? - Wait.

67
00:02:29,834 --> 00:02:31,104
(This is really my credit card.)

68
00:02:31,104 --> 00:02:33,234
- Let me see. - This is really mine.

69
00:02:33,234 --> 00:02:35,694
- What is this? - This is mine, too.

70
00:02:35,964 --> 00:02:37,364
Your manager gave it to us.

71
00:02:37,364 --> 00:02:39,494
Really? I lost this card quite a long time ago.

72
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:41,494
But the problem is...

73
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,494
- Did you really lose it? - Yes.

74
00:02:42,494 --> 00:02:43,494
My credit limit...

75
00:02:44,294 --> 00:02:46,034
I can spend only up to 80 dollars.

76
00:02:46,034 --> 00:02:48,364
- Gosh. - Don't be ridiculous.

77
00:02:48,364 --> 00:02:50,864
I lowered the limit in case I lose my card.

78
00:02:50,864 --> 00:02:52,234
There's no card with an 80-dollar limit.

79
00:02:52,234 --> 00:02:53,494
- So... - Yes?

80
00:02:53,764 --> 00:02:55,334
- What? - Last time on Running Man,

81
00:02:55,564 --> 00:02:58,734
I played that spaghetti game.

82
00:02:59,134 --> 00:03:01,494
- I had to cut the pasta noodle... - I remember.

83
00:03:01,494 --> 00:03:03,934
- as short as I could. - I think we'll win this game.

84
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,594
Aren't you shy, Kyung Soo?

85
00:03:05,664 --> 00:03:06,934
We do such things often.

86
00:03:07,564 --> 00:03:09,764
Yesterday, we kissed each other goodbye as well.

87
00:03:10,334 --> 00:03:13,464
I know Kyung Soo well since we shoot a show together,

88
00:03:13,464 --> 00:03:15,034
- and he's really shy. - Right.

89
00:03:15,034 --> 00:03:16,734
Right. He's a man.

90
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:18,834
Kyung Soo is more shy than people think.

91
00:03:18,834 --> 00:03:20,534
Why are you all flushed?

92
00:03:21,094 --> 00:03:23,434
- You said we had a kiss. - He's really red.

93
00:03:23,564 --> 00:03:25,134
I'm not sure if I can do this.

94
00:03:25,794 --> 00:03:27,994
Isn't it a game people usually play right after they meet each other?

95
00:03:28,064 --> 00:03:29,194
You're right.

96
00:03:29,464 --> 00:03:31,234
- Then start. - This is...

97
00:03:33,994 --> 00:03:40,634
(Jung Seok bravely moves toward Jae Seok's pouted lips.)

98
00:03:43,364 --> 00:03:45,394
(He's embarrassed.)

99
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:49,764
(This is the ideal bromance.)

100
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:52,464
I'm eating now. That's so gross.

101
00:03:53,664 --> 00:04:01,664
(It's only 2cm to Jae Seok's lips.)

102
00:04:02,194 --> 00:04:04,364
(Can I get closer?)

103
00:04:04,364 --> 00:04:05,364
Oh, boy!

104
00:04:06,294 --> 00:04:08,034
Do you have to do that?

105
00:04:08,934 --> 00:04:10,834
You did a good job. It was nice.

106
00:04:11,064 --> 00:04:13,994
Jung Seok. We have good chemistry.

107
00:04:14,364 --> 00:04:15,694
It was great.

108
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,194
- It's 1.2cm. - 1.2cm.

109
00:04:19,064 --> 00:04:20,294
You just stay there. I'll come to you.

110
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:22,064
(It's Kyung Soo and Kwang Soo's turn.)

111
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:31,294
(Kyung Soo, just stay there. I'll come to you.)

112
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:32,464
(Too much pressure)

113
00:04:32,464 --> 00:04:34,594
Kyung Soo. You cut the pasta.

114
00:04:34,664 --> 00:04:37,464
You cut the pasta. Kyung Soo bit it off.

115
00:04:37,464 --> 00:04:39,734
(No, our bromance is still in one piece.)

116
00:04:39,734 --> 00:04:41,694
We kissed before parting.

117
00:04:41,694 --> 00:04:43,334
(We kissed yesterday, too.)

118
00:04:43,334 --> 00:04:44,634
You cut the pasta.

119
00:04:44,694 --> 00:04:47,664
You cut the pasta. Kyung Soo bit it off.

120
00:04:47,694 --> 00:04:48,994
- Kyung Soo bit it off. - Hey!

121
00:04:49,064 --> 00:04:50,064
(We just kissed.)

122
00:04:50,064 --> 00:04:51,964
Kyung Soo bit it off.

123
00:04:52,134 --> 00:04:54,764
- Don't eat it. - Yes, that's it.

124
00:04:55,794 --> 00:04:57,864
- Don't eat it. - Yes, that's it.

125
00:04:57,904 --> 00:04:59,904
(I thought I ate it all. Where did that come from?)

126
00:04:59,904 --> 00:05:01,094
Hang on.

127
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:03,134
- This is... - Listen.

128
00:05:03,134 --> 00:05:05,034
Did that come out of his throat?

129
00:05:05,234 --> 00:05:06,294
(Is it throat reflux?)

130
00:05:06,294 --> 00:05:08,234
It's cheese. Stringy cheese.

131
00:05:08,234 --> 00:05:09,594
- That's disgusting. - It's not.

132
00:05:09,594 --> 00:05:12,664
- It's just cheese. Stringy cheese. - Stop it.

133
00:05:12,664 --> 00:05:15,404
- This is a dinnertime show. - It's not gross.

134
00:05:15,404 --> 00:05:17,404
- People will switch channels. - Did you have to turn me...

135
00:05:17,404 --> 00:05:20,294
- into a disgusting person? - I had no choice.

136
00:05:20,864 --> 00:05:22,434
- We could've won. - Gosh.

137
00:05:23,134 --> 00:05:26,194
- Thanks for the food. - Thank you, Kwang Soo.

138
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:27,794
That's just for the food.

139
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:30,994
- You really did swipe my card. - Of course, they did.

140
00:05:30,994 --> 00:05:32,534
(It's the real-name transaction system.)

141
00:05:32,534 --> 00:05:34,164
We drank coffee, too.

142
00:05:34,164 --> 00:05:37,064
- How much was that? - That bill was separate.

143
00:05:37,234 --> 00:05:38,494
Two coffees, right?

144
00:05:38,694 --> 00:05:40,864
- We all had some. - 20 coffees.

145
00:05:41,294 --> 00:05:43,494
- 20 cups of coffee. - Why?

146
00:05:43,964 --> 00:05:46,534
You don't usually drink coffee.

147
00:05:46,534 --> 00:05:49,094
Let's pick a number, number 1 or 2.

148
00:05:49,094 --> 00:05:50,694
Do you want 1 or 2?

149
00:05:51,064 --> 00:05:52,794
- I'll be number one. - Okay.

150
00:05:53,094 --> 00:05:55,594
- Number 1 and you pay, 2 is me. - Okay.

151
00:05:55,594 --> 00:05:57,634
- The coffee lady. - The coffee lady.

152
00:05:57,634 --> 00:06:00,694
Which credit card do you want? Number 1 or number 2?

153
00:06:00,764 --> 00:06:03,994
(Kwang Soo already spent a lot. Will he pay for the coffees, too?)

154
00:06:03,994 --> 00:06:06,534
Which credit card do you want? Number 1 or number 2?

155
00:06:07,264 --> 00:06:08,634
- Number one. - Okay.

156
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:10,134
- Number one. - Okay.

157
00:06:11,034 --> 00:06:12,694
(Would you like to think again?)

158
00:06:12,694 --> 00:06:14,534
- Did she pick mine? - Yes.

159
00:06:14,534 --> 00:06:15,534
Just a moment.

160
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:18,594
My credit card...

161
00:06:19,264 --> 00:06:21,464
It's still warm from the previous swipe.

162
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:22,534
(It's still warm.)

163
00:06:22,534 --> 00:06:25,694
The look on his face... His soul left his body.

164
00:06:26,294 --> 00:06:27,534
Thank you, Kwang Soo.

165
00:06:27,534 --> 00:06:29,564
- Thanks. - 72 dollars' worth of coffee?

166
00:06:29,564 --> 00:06:30,694
Thank you.

167
00:06:31,264 --> 00:06:33,534
You can afford to treat Jung Seok and Kyung Soo.

168
00:06:33,664 --> 00:06:35,334
I feel great. I do.

169
00:06:35,664 --> 00:06:38,394
- You can head to the set now. - Can we?

170
00:06:38,394 --> 00:06:39,434
- Shall we go? - Yes.

171
00:06:39,694 --> 00:06:41,694
- Let's go, Jung Seok. - Okay.

172
00:06:41,694 --> 00:06:43,934
(This is the bromance hangout.)

173
00:06:44,094 --> 00:06:50,634
(This is the Bromance House where boys become tight friends.)

174
00:06:50,934 --> 00:06:53,764
It's empty. No one's here yet.

175
00:06:53,894 --> 00:06:55,594
Seok Jin, I want this.

176
00:06:55,994 --> 00:06:59,594
- You don't even need that. - I want one.

177
00:06:59,594 --> 00:07:00,634
Buy me this.

178
00:07:01,394 --> 00:07:02,964
I will. I'll get you one.

179
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,634
- Sit down, Ji Hyo. - You want everything, don't you?

180
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:08,264
- You youngsters... - Sit down, Ji Hyo.

181
00:07:08,264 --> 00:07:11,194
(This is my ugly, little brother.)

182
00:07:11,534 --> 00:07:12,934
- Buy me this, too. - Hello.

183
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:14,634
Kyung Soo and Jung Seok are here.

184
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,394
Brother! Brother!

185
00:07:18,434 --> 00:07:19,464
He's older.

186
00:07:19,494 --> 00:07:21,564
Hello. How've you been?

187
00:07:21,564 --> 00:07:22,694
Hello.

188
00:07:23,134 --> 00:07:24,394
(Today's teams)

189
00:07:24,394 --> 00:07:26,364
- How are you? - Thanks for coming.

190
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:27,834
Jung Seok.

191
00:07:28,234 --> 00:07:30,234
Hello and welcome.

192
00:07:30,764 --> 00:07:33,994
Please welcome Cho Jung Seok...

193
00:07:34,164 --> 00:07:35,294
and D.O.

194
00:07:35,894 --> 00:07:38,534
- Do Kyung Soo. - He plays a judo player.

195
00:07:38,534 --> 00:07:40,834
- That's right. - "Jealousy Incarnate".

196
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,094
How should I react to that?

197
00:07:43,264 --> 00:07:45,864
Jung Seok, I'm envious.

198
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:48,394
- You must be pleased. - Not him.

199
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:49,694
His girlfriend must be pleased.

200
00:07:49,934 --> 00:07:50,964
(He is the ideal boyfriend.)

201
00:07:50,964 --> 00:07:52,464
- Good point. - You're right.

202
00:07:53,794 --> 00:07:56,364
- You shot the movie "Brother". - Yes.

203
00:07:56,534 --> 00:08:00,164
Today's race is about Bromance House and the friendship within.

204
00:08:00,164 --> 00:08:02,494
Bromance? It's a trend.

205
00:08:02,494 --> 00:08:06,564
Each team of two must do their best to avoid the final penalty.

206
00:08:06,564 --> 00:08:09,134
- There's a penalty? - Only one team will go down.

207
00:08:09,564 --> 00:08:13,464
Each team will complete a few, small missions...

208
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:17,634
and pick a total of four cards in the dealer room behind you.

209
00:08:18,234 --> 00:08:22,334
There are eight different cards to choose from that come in pairs,

210
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:24,434
so that's a total of 16 cards.

211
00:08:24,994 --> 00:08:27,934
Two of those 16 cards are Penalty Cards.

212
00:08:27,964 --> 00:08:32,094
The team that fails to hand over the Penalty Cards to another team...

213
00:08:32,134 --> 00:08:33,634
will pay the final penalty.

214
00:08:33,634 --> 00:08:35,234
Is it a serious penalty?

215
00:08:35,434 --> 00:08:38,364
The losing team has to pay for the food...

216
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:40,964
the staff ate with their own money.

217
00:08:40,964 --> 00:08:42,794
- It's usually me. - That's...

218
00:08:42,794 --> 00:08:43,934
That's Jong Kook's thing.

219
00:08:44,034 --> 00:08:48,004
We're okay with that, but Kyung Soo and Jung Seok are guests.

220
00:08:48,034 --> 00:08:50,564
- Do you have your credit card? - Not right now.

221
00:08:50,734 --> 00:08:52,194
- Not right now? - No.

222
00:08:52,194 --> 00:08:54,134
You should pay for him.

223
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,504
- The elder usually pays. - He's doing well these days.

224
00:08:56,504 --> 00:08:58,434
Come on. You're a superstar.

225
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,164
- I'm proud to know you. - You're right.

226
00:09:01,164 --> 00:09:03,534
- I'm proud of you. - You were a superstar for years.

227
00:09:03,534 --> 00:09:05,064
I'm pleased he's here.

228
00:09:05,064 --> 00:09:07,234
- What about you, Kyung Soo? - I'm not sure.

229
00:09:07,234 --> 00:09:08,934
- You aren't sure? - Don't back out.

230
00:09:08,934 --> 00:09:12,064
We'll send the bill to SM Entertainment.

231
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:14,294
They'll dock your pay.

232
00:09:14,294 --> 00:09:15,634
Get paid the rest.

233
00:09:15,634 --> 00:09:17,504
Before we begin the actual game,

234
00:09:17,504 --> 00:09:20,734
we'll do a little something to find out how each team gets along.

235
00:09:20,934 --> 00:09:24,094
The winner of this game will be given the opportunity...

236
00:09:24,094 --> 00:09:26,394
to check one card before they take a pick.

237
00:09:26,394 --> 00:09:27,794
- The winner of this? - Yes.

238
00:09:27,794 --> 00:09:28,964
It'll improve the odds.

239
00:09:28,964 --> 00:09:32,634
The two members of each team will sing a song together.

240
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,664
Extra points will be awarded...

241
00:09:34,664 --> 00:09:38,134
to public displays of friendship and passion, so do your best.

242
00:09:38,634 --> 00:09:41,934
- Jung Seok is an amazing singer. - He is.

243
00:09:42,034 --> 00:09:43,664
Kyung Soo can sing as well.

244
00:09:43,664 --> 00:09:45,794
- He's a singer. He's in EXO. - He can sing.

245
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:48,394
- He and I both released albums. - I recorded an album.

246
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:50,534
- Me, too. - Don't forget Haha.

247
00:09:50,864 --> 00:09:53,094
- Ji Hyo's a pretty good singer. - I can sing, too.

248
00:09:53,094 --> 00:09:55,464
This is the moment

249
00:09:55,764 --> 00:09:58,134
(My brother's a musical actor.)

250
00:09:58,134 --> 00:10:00,164
That's not how you sing it.

251
00:10:00,164 --> 00:10:02,294
- Stop it. - Isn't that it?

252
00:10:02,294 --> 00:10:04,764
- Let's pick the order. - Let's select the order.

253
00:10:04,764 --> 00:10:06,764
Rock-paper-scissors is boring.

254
00:10:06,864 --> 00:10:10,004
Let's pinch each other and the first to scream goes first.

255
00:10:10,004 --> 00:10:11,394
Pinch the person next to you.

256
00:10:11,464 --> 00:10:13,294
To the left?

257
00:10:13,294 --> 00:10:15,534
- To the left? - I can't grab hold...

258
00:10:15,734 --> 00:10:17,264
of Jong Kook's thigh.

259
00:10:17,264 --> 00:10:19,194
I can't grab hold of any flesh.

260
00:10:19,194 --> 00:10:21,294
It's impossible to pinch your leg.

261
00:10:21,294 --> 00:10:23,194
- It's really impossible. - Try again.

262
00:10:23,194 --> 00:10:26,504
- Do something to let me pinch you. - It's so unfair.

263
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:28,694
How about pulling this?

264
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:30,794
(How about pulling sideburns?)

265
00:10:30,794 --> 00:10:32,234
That really hurts.

266
00:10:32,234 --> 00:10:33,564
(Instead of pinching?)

267
00:10:33,564 --> 00:10:35,334
- That sounds like fun. - It stings.

268
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:36,764
- That should be fun. - Do that.

269
00:10:36,764 --> 00:10:38,364
- Let's do that. - Sideburn-pulling.

270
00:10:38,364 --> 00:10:40,394
- Do you mind? - The hair right here?

271
00:10:40,564 --> 00:10:42,434
Do I get to pull Haha's sideburn?

272
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,234
You can't pull anyone's.

273
00:10:44,234 --> 00:10:46,764
(Why did you choose to sit there?)

274
00:10:46,764 --> 00:10:49,534
There's no one to your right so just don't scream.

275
00:10:49,534 --> 00:10:51,134
Come over here.

276
00:10:51,294 --> 00:10:53,264
- Come on. - Grin and bear it.

277
00:10:53,794 --> 00:10:56,634
- Grin and bear it. - I'm scared for you.

278
00:10:56,994 --> 00:10:58,294
Jong Kook's pulling yours.

279
00:10:59,134 --> 00:11:00,234
(You shouldn't be laughing.)

280
00:11:00,234 --> 00:11:01,494
- Jae Seok. - If mine comes off...

281
00:11:01,964 --> 00:11:03,164
- What if it does? - Kwang Soo.

282
00:11:03,164 --> 00:11:05,064
We need glue on standby.

283
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:06,234
The puller goes first.

284
00:11:06,234 --> 00:11:08,494
You might have a bald spot right here.

285
00:11:08,494 --> 00:11:10,164
Tell me if you pull anything out.

286
00:11:10,164 --> 00:11:12,634
Ji Hyo, tell me if you see him pull anything out.

287
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,964
Your sideburns are so soft.

288
00:11:15,234 --> 00:11:17,094
- Don't do that. - Sorry.

289
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:18,864
- Let's take it slow. - One...

290
00:11:18,864 --> 00:11:21,194
- Gradually pull harder. - On 1, 2, 3.

291
00:11:21,434 --> 00:11:24,294
(The sideburn-pulling commences.)

292
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:27,634
(It's coming slowly.)

293
00:11:27,634 --> 00:11:28,964
On 1, 2, 3.

294
00:11:28,964 --> 00:11:30,294
(They feel it now.)

295
00:11:33,194 --> 00:11:34,394
Okay.

296
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:36,564
(They're about to peel off each other's scalps.)

297
00:11:36,564 --> 00:11:37,764
- I feel it. - Me, too.

298
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,034
- I feel it. - Me, too.

299
00:11:40,034 --> 00:11:42,094
(They can't sit still.)

300
00:11:43,294 --> 00:11:44,534
Why you...

301
00:11:45,534 --> 00:11:48,464
(Jong Kook pulled too hard and Jae Seok's out.)

302
00:11:49,634 --> 00:11:50,694
Stop it!

303
00:11:51,194 --> 00:11:52,934
- Shoot. - I didn't pull hard.

304
00:11:52,934 --> 00:11:54,794
- That wasn't hard? - It wasn't.

305
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,834
- How was that... - Jae Seok's out.

306
00:11:56,894 --> 00:11:58,434
Do I have to grin and bear it again?

307
00:11:59,264 --> 00:12:01,234
- I want to pull someone's hair. - What for?

308
00:12:01,234 --> 00:12:03,964
- I'm good at pulling hair. - I'll pull this side this time.

309
00:12:04,064 --> 00:12:08,164
What difference does it make? Both sides hurt the same.

310
00:12:08,264 --> 00:12:09,594
Good luck, Jung Seok.

311
00:12:09,934 --> 00:12:12,434
Are you all ready? Get ready and go.

312
00:12:12,434 --> 00:12:14,064
Get ready and go.

313
00:12:14,364 --> 00:12:17,064
(Kwang Soo takes a deep breath.)

314
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:22,634
(Haha seems to be doing well.)

315
00:12:22,634 --> 00:12:23,794
Why you...

316
00:12:23,794 --> 00:12:24,864
(Maybe not.)

317
00:12:25,064 --> 00:12:27,234
- What? - I can't stand it anymore.

318
00:12:27,234 --> 00:12:28,294
Did you see that?

319
00:12:29,394 --> 00:12:30,564
Kyung Soo.

320
00:12:30,564 --> 00:12:32,464
- It's no joke. - It's not painful.

321
00:12:32,464 --> 00:12:34,564
Kwang Soo's still...

322
00:12:34,664 --> 00:12:36,564
He pulls really hard!

323
00:12:36,564 --> 00:12:39,234
- Then scream. - He pretends to be nice then pulls.

324
00:12:39,934 --> 00:12:40,964
Then scream.

325
00:12:40,964 --> 00:12:42,394
(Two-faced Jung Seok)

326
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:45,494
- He pulls really hard! - Then scream.

327
00:12:45,734 --> 00:12:46,934
Just scream.

328
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:49,464
- Let's switch hands this time. - Okay.

329
00:12:49,764 --> 00:12:51,794
- In the other direction? - Like this?

330
00:12:52,734 --> 00:12:54,694
- In the other direction? - Like this?

331
00:12:55,434 --> 00:12:57,994
What? What are you doing?

332
00:12:58,434 --> 00:12:59,634
What are you doing?

333
00:13:00,494 --> 00:13:01,994
(Their friendship runs deep.)

334
00:13:01,994 --> 00:13:05,694
Why... You're just here for one day, but I have to shoot tomorrow.

335
00:13:05,694 --> 00:13:07,834
I like this combination. This should be fun.

336
00:13:07,834 --> 00:13:10,094
This should be worth watching.

337
00:13:10,564 --> 00:13:13,134
- Now... - What?

338
00:13:13,134 --> 00:13:14,534
I'll just grab the sideburns.

339
00:13:14,534 --> 00:13:16,294
Then hold it like this.

340
00:13:16,664 --> 00:13:17,894
- Well done. - What did he do?

341
00:13:17,894 --> 00:13:19,534
Beware of Kyung Soo.

342
00:13:19,894 --> 00:13:21,094
(He's planning something.)

343
00:13:21,094 --> 00:13:22,594
- Let's play. - Are you ready?

344
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,194
(Target acquired)

345
00:13:24,194 --> 00:13:25,264
Go.

346
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,394
Go.

347
00:13:28,394 --> 00:13:31,764
(We sense a dogfight.)

348
00:13:32,994 --> 00:13:33,994
Look.

349
00:13:33,994 --> 00:13:35,294
(The giraffe's hunting the tiger.)

350
00:13:35,294 --> 00:13:37,494
I love this. Keep it up.

351
00:13:38,464 --> 00:13:42,494
(It looks like Jung Seok's about to lose a bit of his scalp.)

352
00:13:44,464 --> 00:13:46,464
That hurts. That really hurts.

353
00:13:46,464 --> 00:13:48,034
(Jung Seok's out.)

354
00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:50,494
You got Jung Seok. Well done.

355
00:13:51,034 --> 00:13:53,364
- The switch worked. - Did you see that?

356
00:13:53,364 --> 00:13:56,394
- Couldn't you have kept it in? - Kyung Soo's no joke.

357
00:13:56,464 --> 00:13:59,994
Kyung Soo, you pretended not to care but you're really into this.

358
00:13:59,994 --> 00:14:02,564
- He pulls really hard with a smile. - I saw that.

359
00:14:02,564 --> 00:14:05,334
- He never changed his expression. - Are you ready?

360
00:14:05,334 --> 00:14:07,634
- These two are fun to watch. - Don't forget Kyung Soo.

361
00:14:07,634 --> 00:14:09,464
- He's always smiling. - He's good.

362
00:14:09,494 --> 00:14:11,734
- He has this poker face. - He's scary.

363
00:14:11,734 --> 00:14:13,634
- Don't scream, Kyung Soo. - Ready?

364
00:14:14,094 --> 00:14:15,334
Go.

365
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:16,394
(Round 3)

366
00:14:16,394 --> 00:14:17,494
Go.

367
00:14:17,494 --> 00:14:18,994
(Screaming)

368
00:14:19,294 --> 00:14:21,894
(He screamed as soon as the game began.)

369
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:23,594
(Is my skin still intact?)

370
00:14:23,594 --> 00:14:24,734
What?

371
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,664
- He pulls like... - I know, right?

372
00:14:26,664 --> 00:14:28,364
- Like what? - We all felt it.

373
00:14:28,364 --> 00:14:29,464
Well done.

374
00:14:29,794 --> 00:14:31,134
Why are we playing this game?

375
00:14:31,134 --> 00:14:32,234
Kyung Soo doesn't even flinch.

376
00:14:32,234 --> 00:14:34,094
What is this game?

377
00:14:34,134 --> 00:14:35,364
(Why are they so competitive?)

378
00:14:35,394 --> 00:14:36,934
- You have to pull hard, Kyung Soo. - It already hurts.

379
00:14:36,934 --> 00:14:38,634
- He's really good at this game. - Ready.

380
00:14:38,634 --> 00:14:40,294
(I'm sorry, but I have to do this, Jong Kook.)

381
00:14:40,764 --> 00:14:43,594
(Get back at him for me, Kyung Soo.)

382
00:14:43,594 --> 00:14:45,034
Ready, set, go!

383
00:14:46,694 --> 00:14:48,394
(Screaming)

384
00:14:48,394 --> 00:14:50,734
(He couldn't get Kwang Soo's revenge on Jong Kook.)

385
00:14:50,734 --> 00:14:52,364
Hey! You were almost there.

386
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:53,994
You were almost there.

387
00:14:54,034 --> 00:14:55,394
- Jong Kook is so strong. - It really hurts, though.

388
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,364
- How is Ji Hyo doing it? - Ji Hyo is amazing.

389
00:14:57,364 --> 00:14:59,594
Ji Hyo's side hair is about to peel off.

390
00:14:59,594 --> 00:15:01,364
- It really hurts. - I know.

391
00:15:01,364 --> 00:15:03,264
How are we the last two remaining?

392
00:15:03,534 --> 00:15:05,064
One, two, three.

393
00:15:05,064 --> 00:15:09,094
(The final match is between Ji Hyo and Jong Kook.)

394
00:15:09,094 --> 00:15:10,464
Look at Ji Hyo.

395
00:15:10,464 --> 00:15:13,234
- How is she taking it so well? - I'm sorry, Ji Hyo.

396
00:15:13,334 --> 00:15:17,134
(Will-power versus tiger claws)

397
00:15:17,264 --> 00:15:19,564
- Oh, gosh. - Don't give up, Ji Hyo.

398
00:15:19,894 --> 00:15:20,994
(She can't take it anymore.)

399
00:15:20,994 --> 00:15:23,994
(Why does it hurt so much?)

400
00:15:23,994 --> 00:15:25,564
- Ji Hyo. - It hurts so much.

401
00:15:26,564 --> 00:15:27,734
I did it.

402
00:15:27,734 --> 00:15:28,894
- I did it. - He's such a...

403
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:31,034
- Oh, gosh. - I'm sick of him.

404
00:15:31,034 --> 00:15:34,294
- I'm so sick of you. - Ji Hyo's skin is about to peel.

405
00:15:34,294 --> 00:15:37,294
- Gosh. - You sounded like you're swearing.

406
00:15:37,364 --> 00:15:38,564
I won!

407
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:40,164
(Seok Jin and Jong Kook get to choose the order of the songs.)

408
00:15:40,164 --> 00:15:41,934
Jong Kook is definitely my brother.

409
00:15:41,994 --> 00:15:43,264
Ji Hyo did really well, though.

410
00:15:43,264 --> 00:15:44,794
Which one do you want to listen to first?

411
00:15:44,794 --> 00:15:46,434
- "This is the Moment". - Let's do that.

412
00:15:46,434 --> 00:15:47,994
- You'll go first. - Is it our turn?

413
00:15:47,994 --> 00:15:49,934
- Get up there. - That's our song.

414
00:15:50,034 --> 00:15:52,664
- That's Jung Seok's song, isn't it? - Let's see how good it is.

415
00:15:52,664 --> 00:15:54,634
I want to hear you sing.

416
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:55,934
You looked cool singing that song.

417
00:15:56,034 --> 00:15:57,364
You have to do it.

418
00:15:57,864 --> 00:15:59,094
You have to sing for us to get a high score.

419
00:16:00,394 --> 00:16:02,064
- Here we go. - Gosh.

420
00:16:02,064 --> 00:16:03,264
What's going on here?

421
00:16:03,264 --> 00:16:04,494
Listen to our song.

422
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:06,564
- What are you doing? - Can't you see a singer on stage?

423
00:16:06,564 --> 00:16:07,794
- I know that. - This is the moment

424
00:16:07,794 --> 00:16:10,764
(This is the moment, this is the day)

425
00:16:10,764 --> 00:16:12,034
- This is the day - He's got that special something.

426
00:16:12,434 --> 00:16:13,634
Can you put the microphone down, Jae Seok?

427
00:16:13,634 --> 00:16:15,534
- Be quiet. - Stay seated, Jae Seok.

428
00:16:15,734 --> 00:16:16,834
And demons on their way

429
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:18,594
(I want to sing, too.)

430
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:20,864
You're going to sing the chorus, aren't you? Take his microphone.

431
00:16:22,434 --> 00:16:23,534
This is nice.

432
00:16:23,534 --> 00:16:27,334
(Jung Seok's sweet voice fills up the Bromance House.)

433
00:16:28,434 --> 00:16:34,064
(Is coming into play, is here and now, today)

434
00:16:34,134 --> 00:16:36,034
(Your turn, Jae Seok.)

435
00:16:36,334 --> 00:16:39,634
This is the moment

436
00:16:39,634 --> 00:16:44,264
(Jae Seok is about to ruin this perfect performance.)

437
00:16:44,664 --> 00:16:48,064
When the momentum and the moment are in rhyme

438
00:16:48,064 --> 00:16:49,734
(It's hard to sing seriously.)

439
00:16:49,734 --> 00:16:51,994
- Give me this moment - Give me this moment

440
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:58,034
(Jung Seok doesn't mind the disturbance.)

441
00:16:58,034 --> 00:17:01,634
(This is how a singer should be.)

442
00:17:01,634 --> 00:17:02,864
Let's go!

443
00:17:03,594 --> 00:17:06,094
(Get lost, Grasshopper.)

444
00:17:06,094 --> 00:17:08,734
(Let me go.)

445
00:17:09,334 --> 00:17:14,464
(All the dreaming, scheming, and screaming become one)

446
00:17:14,464 --> 00:17:17,594
(They're screaming over here.)

447
00:17:18,034 --> 00:17:19,494
(This is the day, see it sparkle and shine)

448
00:17:19,494 --> 00:17:20,704
Can you give us your microphone?

449
00:17:20,864 --> 00:17:26,834
When all I've lived for becomes mine

450
00:17:28,334 --> 00:17:29,994
(He hasn't given up just yet.)

451
00:17:31,364 --> 00:17:35,204
(Jung Seok's voice captivates the hearts of men and women.)

452
00:17:35,204 --> 00:17:40,064
To prove to them I've made it on my own

453
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:48,834
(This is the moment, my final test)

454
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:53,764
(Destiny beckoned, I never reckoned)

455
00:17:54,434 --> 00:17:57,094
(It's a magical moment.)

456
00:17:57,704 --> 00:18:00,664
(He sings passionately.)

457
00:18:01,264 --> 00:18:09,094
(The sweetest moment of them all)

458
00:18:09,534 --> 00:18:12,094
(He tries to take a part at the climax of the song.)

459
00:18:12,094 --> 00:18:14,664
(He's stopped.)

460
00:18:17,294 --> 00:18:20,964
(Can I sing just one note?)

461
00:18:22,994 --> 00:18:29,164
(When I look back, I will always recall)

462
00:18:29,164 --> 00:18:35,264
(Moment for moment, this was the moment)

463
00:18:35,564 --> 00:18:42,464
(The greatest moment of them all)

464
00:18:43,204 --> 00:18:47,434
(We love you.)

465
00:18:48,134 --> 00:18:52,364
(His singing makes a variety show feel like a musical.)

466
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:55,434
Cho Jung Seok. Cho Jung Seok.

467
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,834
(You're the best, my brother.)

468
00:18:58,164 --> 00:18:59,894
- What's his score? - What's the score?

469
00:19:00,634 --> 00:19:02,634
- It's 86. - What?

470
00:19:02,634 --> 00:19:04,734
- Are you kidding me? - He wasn't his best himself.

471
00:19:04,734 --> 00:19:06,994
What happened?

472
00:19:06,994 --> 00:19:08,234
How is this possible?

473
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:09,834
There will be bonus points you can earn.

474
00:19:09,834 --> 00:19:12,764
- This doesn't make sense. - They got 86.

475
00:19:12,764 --> 00:19:14,364
- I tried my best. - You did very well.

476
00:19:14,364 --> 00:19:16,664
(A mere machine can't grade the true value of his performance.)

477
00:19:16,664 --> 00:19:18,094
- He's got that something. - He looked so cool.

478
00:19:18,094 --> 00:19:19,264
- I think we lost already. - He was really good.

479
00:19:19,704 --> 00:19:22,364
- Kyung Soo. Kyung Soo. - This is the moment

480
00:19:24,234 --> 00:19:25,864
(Jung Seok left a lasting impression.)

481
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:27,334
- What are you going to sing? - We picked...

482
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:29,364
- "I Miss You" by Kim Bum Soo. - Really?

483
00:19:30,264 --> 00:19:31,864
Please. Why are you doing this?

484
00:19:31,864 --> 00:19:33,994
- Come on. - That's what you want to sing.

485
00:19:33,994 --> 00:19:35,704
- What? - Let Kyung Soo decide.

486
00:19:35,704 --> 00:19:36,994
We have the same taste in music.

487
00:19:36,994 --> 00:19:38,664
Please don't sing that song.

488
00:19:38,934 --> 00:19:40,464
- Does he sing it all the time? - What's wrong?

489
00:19:41,234 --> 00:19:42,634
What's with this reaction?

490
00:19:42,634 --> 00:19:44,034
- Just sing it. - Don't do it.

491
00:19:44,034 --> 00:19:46,534
- He has a thing for ballad songs. - Whom do you miss exactly?

492
00:19:46,534 --> 00:19:48,264
- I like that song. - Who is it?

493
00:19:49,494 --> 00:19:50,734
What about it?

494
00:19:51,434 --> 00:19:53,094
I like it, too.

495
00:19:53,264 --> 00:19:54,734
Whom are you missing?

496
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:57,634
- We'll give it a try. - Go on.

497
00:19:57,834 --> 00:20:00,434
- This is a good song. - Don't get immersed in the song.

498
00:20:00,434 --> 00:20:01,834
Stop it.

499
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:04,234
(The actor brothers immerse themselves in emotion.)

500
00:20:04,234 --> 00:20:05,494
Where's your bottom, Kwang Soo?

501
00:20:07,134 --> 00:20:08,364
Did you leave it at home?

502
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:14,834
(They missed the very first verse.)

503
00:20:14,834 --> 00:20:16,534
I think they failed already.

504
00:20:16,664 --> 00:20:18,094
(They should be disqualified.)

505
00:20:19,664 --> 00:20:21,394
- Like a fool - He's good.

506
00:20:21,394 --> 00:20:24,294
(At this moment, he isn't an actor, but the lead vocalist of EXO.)

507
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:27,164
- That voice. - He's so good.

508
00:20:27,164 --> 00:20:28,164
(She's happy.)

509
00:20:29,034 --> 00:20:32,594
(Kwang Soo looks like the lead vocal judging by the facial expressions.)

510
00:20:33,764 --> 00:20:38,064
(Kyung Soo sings with a sorrowful voice.)

511
00:20:38,064 --> 00:20:40,834
- Why are you singing along? - This isn't your part.

512
00:20:40,834 --> 00:20:47,034
(Kwang Soo sings with a pitiful voice.)

513
00:20:47,764 --> 00:20:51,834
(He's very into it.)

514
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,264
(Stop it.)

515
00:20:54,894 --> 00:20:56,634
(Can we listen to Kyung Soo sing?)

516
00:20:57,534 --> 00:21:03,034
(I want to cry, kneel down for me)

517
00:21:03,034 --> 00:21:08,494
(If it turns out there's nothing we can do about it)

518
00:21:09,364 --> 00:21:14,294
(The others are being mischievous.)

519
00:21:14,704 --> 00:21:16,894
(They have no idea of what is going on.)

520
00:21:18,634 --> 00:21:20,294
(Approaching)

521
00:21:22,294 --> 00:21:24,294
(You didn't see this coming, did you?)

522
00:21:25,664 --> 00:21:30,964
(Keep disturbing us. We'll just get more emotional.)

523
00:21:31,664 --> 00:21:36,634
(They're singing their lungs out.)

524
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:43,534
(People could listen to Kyung Soo's sweet voice all day.)

525
00:21:43,864 --> 00:21:46,704
(And...)

526
00:21:46,704 --> 00:21:49,594
(people would want to stop listening to Kwang Soo's voice.)

527
00:21:49,594 --> 00:21:51,334
- Eat it. - Swallow it.

528
00:21:51,734 --> 00:21:52,994
What's wrong?

529
00:21:53,664 --> 00:21:55,094
Here it is.

530
00:21:55,934 --> 00:21:57,864
(Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo scored 88 points.)

531
00:21:57,864 --> 00:21:58,934
We got 88.

532
00:21:58,934 --> 00:22:00,334
- How is that possible? - How did they do that?

533
00:22:00,334 --> 00:22:01,694
"Did You See?" by Jeong Sam.

534
00:22:02,234 --> 00:22:03,834
- Jeong Sam. - Let's go.

535
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:05,694
I wish you a pleasant evening.

536
00:22:06,334 --> 00:22:07,394
This one is called, "Did You See?"

537
00:22:07,764 --> 00:22:11,164
I put my heart into this song.

538
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,964
(What's going on here?)

539
00:22:13,294 --> 00:22:14,634
One, two, three, four.

540
00:22:14,634 --> 00:22:16,264
(Did you see? Did you see?)

541
00:22:16,264 --> 00:22:20,034
(Why are we the ones embarrassed?)

542
00:22:21,064 --> 00:22:23,494
(Is this how variety shows are like?)

543
00:22:24,064 --> 00:22:27,164
(Trust your man)

544
00:22:28,434 --> 00:22:29,594
(I want to say something, but I won't.)

545
00:22:29,594 --> 00:22:31,164
This is how I feel.

546
00:22:31,164 --> 00:22:32,464
What score did you get?

547
00:22:32,694 --> 00:22:34,064
- 88. - Not bad.

548
00:22:34,064 --> 00:22:36,594
- We're tied. - That was the best.

549
00:22:36,764 --> 00:22:39,064
The look on Kyung Soo's face was hilarious.

550
00:22:39,064 --> 00:22:40,394
Kyung Soo was like this.

551
00:22:40,994 --> 00:22:42,064
(What's wrong with that old man?)

552
00:22:42,064 --> 00:22:43,764
- In the end, he was like this. - You were?

553
00:22:43,764 --> 00:22:45,864
- You were like that? - Kyung Soo must've felt like...

554
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,694
he saw his uncle singing at a karaoke bar...

555
00:22:48,694 --> 00:22:51,764
on holiday season.

556
00:22:51,764 --> 00:22:52,864
A drunk uncle.

557
00:22:53,464 --> 00:22:55,064
He was looking at him with pity.

558
00:22:55,294 --> 00:22:57,964
He was probably thinking, "I want to go home."

559
00:22:58,434 --> 00:23:01,034
- Ji Hyo's singing's gotten better. - Let's show them what we've got.

560
00:23:01,534 --> 00:23:04,764
(Coming up next is a stage by an aunt and an uncle.)

561
00:23:04,834 --> 00:23:08,364
("Rose of Betrayal" by Uhm Jung Hwa)

562
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,764
(It's a collaboration between an aunt and an uncle.)

563
00:23:14,294 --> 00:23:16,394
(It's a culture shock.)

564
00:23:17,694 --> 00:23:20,064
(We will come in first place.)

565
00:23:21,564 --> 00:23:22,794
(Haha and Ji Hyo scored 91 points.)

566
00:23:22,794 --> 00:23:25,234
- They got 91. - How did they do that?

567
00:23:25,234 --> 00:23:26,934
How did they get 91?

568
00:23:26,934 --> 00:23:30,164
Honestly, you should deduce that by 10 points.

569
00:23:30,164 --> 00:23:32,534
- Where's your consciousness? - Seriously.

570
00:23:32,764 --> 00:23:35,194
- I said there are bonus points. - Right.

571
00:23:35,194 --> 00:23:37,064
This was the criteria for the bonus points.

572
00:23:37,494 --> 00:23:39,134
If other teams stood up out of joy while you were singing,

573
00:23:39,134 --> 00:23:41,064
you'd receive as many points as...

574
00:23:41,064 --> 00:23:42,964
the number of people who stood up times two.

575
00:23:43,064 --> 00:23:44,264
- Multiplied by two? - Yes.

576
00:23:44,264 --> 00:23:45,864
We should be the winner, then.

577
00:23:45,864 --> 00:23:48,334
- What did you mean by "out of joy"? - These are the results.

578
00:23:48,334 --> 00:23:51,564
Haha and Ji Hyo scored 91 points on the karaoke machine.

579
00:23:51,994 --> 00:23:53,134
The number of people who stood up is...

580
00:23:53,134 --> 00:23:55,764
(How many people in the audience got up from their seats?)

581
00:23:55,764 --> 00:23:56,894
There were none.

582
00:23:57,194 --> 00:23:58,294
You got 91 points in total.

583
00:23:58,664 --> 00:24:00,394
Their performance wasn't fun.

584
00:24:00,394 --> 00:24:02,894
Jae Seok and Jung Seok scored 86 points on the karaoke machine.

585
00:24:03,534 --> 00:24:04,764
The number of people who stood up is...

586
00:24:04,764 --> 00:24:06,064
(Their performance was greatly appreciated by many.)

587
00:24:06,064 --> 00:24:07,764
Everyone.

588
00:24:08,294 --> 00:24:13,564
(Jung Seok's singing received a standing ovation.)

589
00:24:13,934 --> 00:24:16,094
You get 12 bonus points. 98 points in total.

590
00:24:17,294 --> 00:24:19,464
What are you so happy about? It's not like it was because of you.

591
00:24:19,634 --> 00:24:21,664
Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo had three people stand up.

592
00:24:21,664 --> 00:24:23,194
You got 94 points in total.

593
00:24:23,194 --> 00:24:26,064
For Seok Jin and Jong Kook, Haha was the only one up.

594
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:27,134
Did you stand up?

595
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:28,294
I did?

596
00:24:28,294 --> 00:24:29,794
(I have no recollection of that memory.)

597
00:24:29,794 --> 00:24:30,964
It was fun listening to you sing.

598
00:24:31,164 --> 00:24:32,464
- Wasn't it? - It was.

599
00:24:32,934 --> 00:24:35,664
I was watching them, but they kept asking if I was looking at them.

600
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:39,164
- Jae Seok and Jung Seok won. - Okay.

601
00:24:39,364 --> 00:24:41,994
- We sang really well, didn't we? - Okay.

602
00:24:42,794 --> 00:24:46,494
The first card will be drawn by Jung Seok.

603
00:24:46,864 --> 00:24:48,594
Only Jung Seok can go inside to choose a card.

604
00:24:48,594 --> 00:24:50,034
- I see. - Okay.

605
00:24:50,064 --> 00:24:51,934
- Select a good card. - Trust me.

606
00:24:51,994 --> 00:24:53,064
This is great.

607
00:24:53,164 --> 00:24:57,634
(Jung Seok confidently goes into the room.)

608
00:24:59,094 --> 00:25:00,334
(He strides inside.)

609
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:01,334
Here are the cards.

610
00:25:01,694 --> 00:25:04,264
Since you won the game,

611
00:25:04,534 --> 00:25:07,264
please select one card you would like to check first.

612
00:25:08,264 --> 00:25:10,034
- I choose this one. - Okay.

613
00:25:11,634 --> 00:25:13,964
(The card he chose is showing all of one's special talents.)

614
00:25:13,964 --> 00:25:16,834
Now, please choose a card.

615
00:25:16,834 --> 00:25:17,834
Okay.

616
00:25:17,834 --> 00:25:18,834
(He can also choose the card he checked beforehand.)

617
00:25:19,634 --> 00:25:22,264
- This one. - Please check the card you picked.

618
00:25:22,264 --> 00:25:24,434
(What is the card Jung Seok selected as their first card?)

619
00:25:25,434 --> 00:25:27,234
Please show the card to the camera.

620
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:30,064
(He doesn't seem happy about his choice.)

621
00:25:32,234 --> 00:25:34,334
(His first card is the Penalty Card.)

622
00:25:36,094 --> 00:25:40,234
(Even if he was in an advantageous position, he seems to be unlucky.)

623
00:25:42,064 --> 00:25:43,494
- Did you choose a card? - Yes, I did.

624
00:25:43,694 --> 00:25:46,064
- It's possible he picked a bad one. - Of course.

625
00:25:46,064 --> 00:25:47,764
He could've picked the worst one out of all.

626
00:25:47,764 --> 00:25:50,164
(This is the penalty card, isn't it?)

627
00:25:50,164 --> 00:25:51,664
Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo are next.

628
00:25:51,664 --> 00:25:52,664
Okay.

629
00:25:52,664 --> 00:25:54,064
(Kyung Soo picks a card since he won second place.)

630
00:25:54,694 --> 00:25:56,564
(Charm Card)

631
00:25:56,564 --> 00:25:57,834
What is this?

632
00:25:58,394 --> 00:26:00,094
(Forehead Kiss Card)

633
00:26:00,094 --> 00:26:01,464
(Highway Card)

634
00:26:02,964 --> 00:26:05,994
(Every team selected their first card.)

635
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:09,464
(12 cards remain. What will they face?)

636
00:26:09,894 --> 00:26:12,664
The second mission is "Trust in Your Brother".

637
00:26:12,664 --> 00:26:13,834
- What is that? - Now, this is sounds exciting.

638
00:26:14,994 --> 00:26:18,834
The team that wins this mission can check three cards.

639
00:26:18,834 --> 00:26:22,534
The 2nd place team gets 2 cards. The 3rd place team gets 1 card.

640
00:26:22,534 --> 00:26:24,734
- You can only check them inside. - I see.

641
00:26:24,734 --> 00:26:26,594
Younger brothers will solve the quizzes in the front.

642
00:26:26,594 --> 00:26:28,364
Older brothers will sit under the trays and the trays...

643
00:26:28,364 --> 00:26:30,564
will fall on their heads if their brothers give wrong answers.

644
00:26:30,564 --> 00:26:32,634
- Trust in me. - I trust you.

645
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:34,794
- When you figure out the answer, - If you know it, call it.

646
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:37,434
you need to ring a special buzzer...

647
00:26:37,434 --> 00:26:39,434
that the staff suggests.

648
00:26:39,434 --> 00:26:40,864
- Okay. - I understand.

649
00:26:40,894 --> 00:26:44,064
Before we start, I'll let you know the special buzzer.

650
00:26:44,064 --> 00:26:45,094
Ji Hyo, be proactive.

651
00:26:45,094 --> 00:26:47,834
The special buzzer for this round is charms.

652
00:26:47,834 --> 00:26:48,994
(They need to show off their charms.)

653
00:26:48,994 --> 00:26:50,194
We're doomed.

654
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:52,064
- No way. - You have to show your charms.

655
00:26:52,064 --> 00:26:53,534
- Kyung Soo, show your charms. - Come to the front and show them.

656
00:26:53,534 --> 00:26:54,794
- I'm sure Kyung Soo's good at it. - How...

657
00:26:54,794 --> 00:26:56,534
- How will he do that? - Jong Kook.

658
00:26:56,534 --> 00:26:58,634
- Ji Hyo, show us one. - I trust in you, Jong Kook.

659
00:26:58,634 --> 00:27:00,394
Jung Seok is good at things like this.

660
00:27:00,564 --> 00:27:01,964
- Of course, he is. - He's full of charms.

661
00:27:01,964 --> 00:27:03,534
- He does have a lot of them. - Come on.

662
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,694
- It is a picture association quiz. - A picture association quiz.

663
00:27:07,264 --> 00:27:08,994
Yes, I'll show you the first one.

664
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:11,194
In 1, 2, 3.

665
00:27:11,694 --> 00:27:12,864
(What is it?)

666
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,964
- What is that? - It's a dog.

667
00:27:15,164 --> 00:27:16,464
I think I know this one.

668
00:27:16,464 --> 00:27:18,594
(The first problem looks difficult.)

669
00:27:18,894 --> 00:27:21,434
(What is that dog?)

670
00:27:21,994 --> 00:27:23,234
The dog is standing on a stage.

671
00:27:23,234 --> 00:27:24,464
(They are speechless.)

672
00:27:24,464 --> 00:27:25,834
What is it? I seriously have no clue.

673
00:27:25,834 --> 00:27:27,664
- The dog is the main part of it. - Is that Gary?

674
00:27:27,994 --> 00:27:29,664
(I figured out the answer.)

675
00:27:30,864 --> 00:27:32,764
- Show your charms. - You have to show them.

676
00:27:33,064 --> 00:27:35,134
Show them. I know you can do it.

677
00:27:35,434 --> 00:27:37,764
- One plus one is a cutie pie - Come on.

678
00:27:37,794 --> 00:27:39,564
(She always does that.)

679
00:27:39,934 --> 00:27:42,434
(She's trying her best to show them her charms.)

680
00:27:42,434 --> 00:27:43,664
Darn it.

681
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:44,834
(Darn it.)

682
00:27:45,334 --> 00:27:46,564
(This is his third culture shock.)

683
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:49,264
- Look at Kyung Soo's face. - I'm her partner. I'm going crazy.

684
00:27:49,264 --> 00:27:50,794
- Can Jong Kook try? - The answer is...

685
00:27:50,994 --> 00:27:51,994
He can't see.

686
00:27:52,164 --> 00:27:53,164
It's Gary.

687
00:27:54,264 --> 00:27:56,534
(Is the identity of this dog...)

688
00:27:56,534 --> 00:27:57,964
(Gary?)

689
00:27:57,994 --> 00:27:59,264
- Did she say Gary? - How is that Gary?

690
00:27:59,264 --> 00:28:00,264
(It's incorrect.)

691
00:28:00,264 --> 00:28:02,734
(How can it possibly be Gary?)

692
00:28:02,734 --> 00:28:03,994
It's a dog.

693
00:28:04,094 --> 00:28:05,734
Can all the dogs be Gary?

694
00:28:05,894 --> 00:28:07,464
Have you not forgotten him yet?

695
00:28:07,464 --> 00:28:09,094
- No, it looks like Gary. - It's too late, Ji Hyo.

696
00:28:09,094 --> 00:28:10,564
- The answer has three syllables. - What is it?

697
00:28:10,664 --> 00:28:12,034
I think I figured it out for certain.

698
00:28:12,564 --> 00:28:13,794
- Are you sure? - What is it?

699
00:28:13,834 --> 00:28:15,264
"I love you, woof woof"?

700
00:28:15,264 --> 00:28:17,794
- The first syllable is correct. - Right.

701
00:28:17,794 --> 00:28:19,434
- Okay. - We know the first one.

702
00:28:20,164 --> 00:28:22,794
- A cheering dog? - Isn't it individual skill?

703
00:28:23,964 --> 00:28:25,364
Go, Jung Seok.

704
00:28:25,364 --> 00:28:26,834
(They both get up at the same time.)

705
00:28:26,894 --> 00:28:28,164
- Jung Seok was first. - Come on.

706
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,634
(Hello, I'm here.)

707
00:28:29,634 --> 00:28:31,794
- Stop it. - Jung Seok got there first.

708
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:33,964
(We made this segment to see Jung Seok's charms.)

709
00:28:33,964 --> 00:28:35,434
- Come on. - Why did you go up with him?

710
00:28:35,434 --> 00:28:36,764
Jung Seok was here first.

711
00:28:36,764 --> 00:28:38,064
- What did you say? - He's angry.

712
00:28:38,064 --> 00:28:39,534
I went through all this trouble for nothing?

713
00:28:39,864 --> 00:28:41,794
- Who said you were first? - Why didn't you tell me earlier?

714
00:28:41,794 --> 00:28:42,994
You should've told me earlier!

715
00:28:43,664 --> 00:28:44,994
He even looked scary.

716
00:28:46,864 --> 00:28:47,894
- Jung Seok. - Should I show mine?

717
00:28:47,894 --> 00:28:48,934
Yes, you need to show your charms.

718
00:28:48,964 --> 00:28:50,634
Show them how it's properly done.

719
00:28:50,634 --> 00:28:52,094
I showed them a lot of charms.

720
00:28:52,534 --> 00:28:56,334
(Every woman has been waiting for this moment.)

721
00:28:56,894 --> 00:29:00,464
(Only his girlfriend saw his charms. Now, he's about to show to all.)

722
00:29:01,164 --> 00:29:02,564
- You'll do fine, Jung Seok. - Right now...

723
00:29:02,564 --> 00:29:05,894
- What was that? - Gosh, I can't do it.

724
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,364
- Was that it? - He blew his chance.

725
00:29:07,364 --> 00:29:08,794
- I can only give you one chance. - Jung Seok, just do it.

726
00:29:09,534 --> 00:29:10,994
Why don't you pretend to be cute at least?

727
00:29:10,994 --> 00:29:11,994
(He tries to be cute.)

728
00:29:11,994 --> 00:29:13,464
- What is that? He can't do that. - It's acceptable.

729
00:29:13,464 --> 00:29:14,694
That's good enough.

730
00:29:14,734 --> 00:29:16,064
This is good enough?

731
00:29:16,094 --> 00:29:18,164
- The answer is individual skill. - Seriously?

732
00:29:18,164 --> 00:29:19,294
- Individual skill? - Hold on.

733
00:29:19,434 --> 00:29:20,794
The answer is individual skill.

734
00:29:20,794 --> 00:29:26,794
(Is his answer, individual skill, correct?)

735
00:29:27,534 --> 00:29:28,964
(It's correct.)

736
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:31,334
(Everyone gets smacked by a tray.)

737
00:29:31,734 --> 00:29:33,764
- Really? - How is that possible?

738
00:29:33,764 --> 00:29:35,234
(He managed to get a point unexpectedly.)

739
00:29:35,764 --> 00:29:37,164
- I see. - It is individual skill.

740
00:29:37,164 --> 00:29:39,564
- Now, I understand. - Right.

741
00:29:39,964 --> 00:29:41,694
It is individual skill. This makes sense now.

742
00:29:41,694 --> 00:29:42,894
Excuse me.

743
00:29:42,894 --> 00:29:45,934
You need to be more objective when you are judging his charms.

744
00:29:45,934 --> 00:29:48,364
- Are you serious now? - He should go back if it's bad.

745
00:29:48,364 --> 00:29:50,534
- Jong Kook's charms were good, too. - What you did wasn't charming!

746
00:29:50,634 --> 00:29:53,364
(It almost made everyone turn against him.)

747
00:29:53,364 --> 00:29:54,964
- I thought I was going to lose it. - I'll show you more later.

748
00:29:54,964 --> 00:29:56,934
What you did was threatening the staff.

749
00:29:57,594 --> 00:29:59,364
(He can get your money back for you.)

750
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:01,994
The next buzzer will be charms again.

751
00:30:01,994 --> 00:30:02,994
(It's the same buzzer.)

752
00:30:03,464 --> 00:30:05,294
It's a picture association quiz again.

753
00:30:05,434 --> 00:30:07,434
In 1, 2, 3.

754
00:30:07,694 --> 00:30:08,734
(What?)

755
00:30:09,494 --> 00:30:10,864
(The picture is absurd again.)

756
00:30:10,864 --> 00:30:12,364
- Is he skating? - He is skating.

757
00:30:12,364 --> 00:30:14,994
(He's skating and it says "kick".)

758
00:30:14,994 --> 00:30:16,794
- What is it? - Kick?

759
00:30:16,834 --> 00:30:18,764
Kick, kick, kick, kick.

760
00:30:18,764 --> 00:30:19,764
There are ten kicks.

761
00:30:20,164 --> 00:30:22,064
Look at where 'kick' is written.

762
00:30:22,064 --> 00:30:23,864
- The place? It's placed purposely? - Yes.

763
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:25,934
Think about the written letter and the place.

764
00:30:26,064 --> 00:30:27,134
This is too challenging.

765
00:30:27,564 --> 00:30:28,564
It is hard indeed.

766
00:30:28,564 --> 00:30:29,994
Who drew this picture?

767
00:30:30,634 --> 00:30:32,794
The last syllable is kick.

768
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:34,734
There must be syllables before 'kick'.

769
00:30:34,764 --> 00:30:36,164
The answer should end with that syllable.

770
00:30:36,164 --> 00:30:37,334
(I figured it out.)

771
00:30:38,734 --> 00:30:40,094
- What are you doing? - What is it?

772
00:30:40,864 --> 00:30:42,694
(Kwang Soo scared him.)

773
00:30:42,694 --> 00:30:44,534
- What did you do? - Why are you so startled?

774
00:30:44,534 --> 00:30:45,664
What's wrong, Kyung Soo?

775
00:30:45,864 --> 00:30:47,664
What did you do to him?

776
00:30:47,664 --> 00:30:49,364
- I didn't blow into his ear. - What was that?

777
00:30:49,364 --> 00:30:50,934
- I didn't blow into his ear. - Hold on.

778
00:30:51,494 --> 00:30:53,264
(He walks confidently.)

779
00:30:53,264 --> 00:30:54,664
I figured it out.

780
00:30:54,664 --> 00:30:55,734
(He's getting ready to show his charms.)

781
00:30:55,734 --> 00:30:57,364
I know the answer now.

782
00:30:58,534 --> 00:30:59,834
This is my charm.

783
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,664
(His charms are very straightforward.)

784
00:31:02,664 --> 00:31:04,834
- What is that? - How can you call it a charm?

785
00:31:04,834 --> 00:31:05,864
You can't accept that.

786
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,064
(He's showing all of his charms.)

787
00:31:07,064 --> 00:31:08,464
- He knows the answer. - What is that?

788
00:31:08,464 --> 00:31:10,234
(Am I not cute?)

789
00:31:10,534 --> 00:31:12,264
Do a little more, Kyung Soo.

790
00:31:12,264 --> 00:31:13,464
- Show them some moves. - This is not acceptable.

791
00:31:13,464 --> 00:31:15,164
(He's trying desperately.)

792
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,594
He's not charming. He's acting out.

793
00:31:16,594 --> 00:31:18,464
This is his best work.

794
00:31:18,464 --> 00:31:20,864
- Okay. We accept. - How can this be acceptable?

795
00:31:21,234 --> 00:31:22,264
- The answer is corner kick. - Come on.

796
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:23,464
This is the answer.

797
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,534
(It's correct.)

798
00:31:26,994 --> 00:31:28,594
(They are smacked by the trays.)

799
00:31:29,264 --> 00:31:30,264
- That hurts. - You can't allow it.

800
00:31:30,534 --> 00:31:32,164
(He is feeling proud.)

801
00:31:32,164 --> 00:31:33,964
Kwang Soo told him the answer from the back.

802
00:31:33,964 --> 00:31:36,934
(Kwang Soo is teaching him how to cheat as a brother.)

803
00:31:36,934 --> 00:31:39,294
The next special buzzer is dance.

804
00:31:39,534 --> 00:31:43,094
The next quiz will be middle-aged men quiz.

805
00:31:43,094 --> 00:31:44,964
- Is that so? - Ji Hyo's really good at it.

806
00:31:44,964 --> 00:31:46,094
We are all middle-aged men after all.

807
00:31:46,094 --> 00:31:47,364
Kyung Soo will have a hard time.

808
00:31:47,534 --> 00:31:48,834
I don't feel confident about this.

809
00:31:48,834 --> 00:31:51,264
What is another word for a letter of apology?

810
00:31:51,694 --> 00:31:53,934
- I know this one. - I've heard of this.

811
00:31:53,964 --> 00:31:55,094
Another word for a letter of apology?

812
00:31:55,264 --> 00:31:56,494
I should know this one.

813
00:31:57,094 --> 00:31:58,864
What is it? Another word for a letter of apology?

814
00:31:58,964 --> 00:32:00,734
- What was this? - Do you know this one?

815
00:32:00,734 --> 00:32:02,264
I knew this before.

816
00:32:02,464 --> 00:32:03,894
- That's cheating. - You can't tell her.

817
00:32:03,894 --> 00:32:05,334
(They are not hiding the fact that they're cheating anymore.)

818
00:32:05,334 --> 00:32:07,164
- He told her. - That shouldn't happen.

819
00:32:07,464 --> 00:32:09,434
(What is this song?)

820
00:32:09,464 --> 00:32:11,564
(You know the dance moves for this song, right?)

821
00:32:11,564 --> 00:32:12,764
(She dances as she wants to.)

822
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,664
- What is that? Do the dance move. - You need to do it properly.

823
00:32:14,664 --> 00:32:16,464
(Don't you know Twice's dance?)

824
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:18,064
(It's evident she hasn't seen it before.)

825
00:32:18,064 --> 00:32:19,434
What kind of dance move is that?

826
00:32:19,464 --> 00:32:20,664
What was that?

827
00:32:20,664 --> 00:32:21,694
That was not acceptable.

828
00:32:21,734 --> 00:32:22,834
(Haha gets smacked.)

829
00:32:23,094 --> 00:32:25,864
You're supposed to look cute as you put your fingers below your chin.

830
00:32:25,864 --> 00:32:27,334
Hey, that's not how you do it.

831
00:32:27,334 --> 00:32:29,364
- You only do it with one finger. - This is how you do it.

832
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:30,464
- Only one finger. - Look at this.

833
00:32:30,794 --> 00:32:31,794
(She's trying to be cute.)

834
00:32:31,794 --> 00:32:32,894
Try to be cute.

835
00:32:33,794 --> 00:32:34,994
You need to do the next one, too.

836
00:32:35,434 --> 00:32:36,664
(Darn it.)

837
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:38,664
- I'm done! - Come on, Ji Hyo.

838
00:32:38,794 --> 00:32:40,934
- Why can't you do this? - Like this?

839
00:32:41,064 --> 00:32:43,264
Have your fingers like this and move it like this.

840
00:32:46,094 --> 00:32:49,964
- Hey, that's not right. - Give me a break!

841
00:32:50,164 --> 00:32:52,934
- Hey, Ji Hyo. This isn't hard. - I can't do it.

842
00:32:53,294 --> 00:32:54,864
- What is it? - Fine. I'll show you.

843
00:32:54,864 --> 00:32:56,064
(Let's see how well you do.)

844
00:32:57,364 --> 00:32:59,864
- That's not right. - You don't do it like that.

845
00:32:59,864 --> 00:33:02,064
- What is he doing? - That's wrong.

846
00:33:02,834 --> 00:33:04,864
- How can you mess it up? - What can the answer be?

847
00:33:05,364 --> 00:33:06,594
(I figured it out.)

848
00:33:08,064 --> 00:33:10,464
- Hey, that's cheating. - What are you doing?

849
00:33:10,564 --> 00:33:13,094
- Jung Seok, it's time to dance. - Okay. I got it.

850
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:15,564
Jung Seok.

851
00:33:16,164 --> 00:33:17,234
(He's good.)

852
00:33:18,064 --> 00:33:19,064
Jung Seok.

853
00:33:22,294 --> 00:33:23,434
What is that?

854
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:25,964
(His moves are out-dated, but he looks good dancing.)

855
00:33:27,134 --> 00:33:28,694
(He pokes and spins.)

856
00:33:28,694 --> 00:33:30,964
That was lovely.

857
00:33:31,664 --> 00:33:33,064
(He's too enthusiastic.)

858
00:33:33,064 --> 00:33:34,364
- Here we go. - Okay.

859
00:33:34,734 --> 00:33:35,734
The answer is global.

860
00:33:35,734 --> 00:33:36,894
- That's right. - Why is it global?

861
00:33:36,894 --> 00:33:38,394
There we go.

862
00:33:39,834 --> 00:33:41,994
- I understand now. - That makes sense.

863
00:33:41,994 --> 00:33:43,534
(A person writes the letter as the person is being punished.)

864
00:33:44,094 --> 00:33:45,864
- That was the right answer. - I see now.

865
00:33:45,864 --> 00:33:47,764
Now the older brothers will be solving the quizzes.

866
00:33:47,764 --> 00:33:48,934
- Okay. - Great.

867
00:33:49,464 --> 00:33:51,894
- Do it well. - You did well, Jung Seok.

868
00:33:52,334 --> 00:33:54,664
Gosh, look at them. I mean,

869
00:33:54,664 --> 00:33:56,864
everyone out here plays dirty.

870
00:33:57,164 --> 00:33:58,264
They're all gathered here.

871
00:33:58,264 --> 00:34:00,234
(Dirty players are all gathered.)

872
00:34:00,234 --> 00:34:01,864
The next buzzer is charms.

873
00:34:02,434 --> 00:34:03,994
- Charms again? - The rule is the same as before.

874
00:34:03,994 --> 00:34:06,164
- I'm ready for it. - It's going to be hard for me.

875
00:34:06,164 --> 00:34:07,534
You'll see a picture.

876
00:34:07,834 --> 00:34:09,234
You need to tell me the title and the line from the scene.

877
00:34:09,234 --> 00:34:10,934
- Even the line? - The title of the film?

878
00:34:10,964 --> 00:34:12,364
It's going to be hard to tell the line.

879
00:34:12,364 --> 00:34:15,104
In 1, 2, 3. Here it is.

880
00:34:15,634 --> 00:34:16,834
- Got it. - What is this?

881
00:34:16,834 --> 00:34:17,894
- Hold on. - Line from this scene?

882
00:34:17,894 --> 00:34:20,034
Do you seriously expect us to tell you the line from this scene?

883
00:34:20,604 --> 00:34:21,664
- Hold on, the line is... - How is it possible?

884
00:34:21,664 --> 00:34:23,994
It's the famous line.

885
00:34:24,164 --> 00:34:25,394
This scene was...

886
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,534
- This is one of the famous lines. - Jung Seok, which film is it?

887
00:34:27,664 --> 00:34:29,694
- Isn't this "Architecture 101"? - Do you not know?

888
00:34:29,694 --> 00:34:30,764
- I think I know. - It's not fair...

889
00:34:30,764 --> 00:34:32,134
to ask the line.

890
00:34:32,194 --> 00:34:34,194
- You should not ask him. - I'll answer.

891
00:34:34,194 --> 00:34:35,864
I'll answer it. Let me.

892
00:34:35,934 --> 00:34:37,134
This is a famous line.

893
00:34:37,264 --> 00:34:38,994
The buzzer is showing my charm, right?

894
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:41,134
- "Honey, I dreamed of a ghost." - Go away.

895
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:42,294
Get out of the way.

896
00:34:42,934 --> 00:34:45,194
(Kwang Soo pretends to be sulky to act cute.)

897
00:34:45,534 --> 00:34:48,864
I dreamed of a ghost.

898
00:34:49,364 --> 00:34:50,694
(This is crazy.)

899
00:34:52,264 --> 00:34:54,364
- Jae Seok, answer, please. - Okay.

900
00:34:54,364 --> 00:34:55,834
You came out first.

901
00:34:56,104 --> 00:34:57,694
- It's the movie "Architecture 101". - Okay.

902
00:34:57,694 --> 00:34:59,064
(The movie is "Architecture 101".)

903
00:34:59,064 --> 00:35:00,064
"What should I do?"

904
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:02,104
(The line is "What should I do?")

905
00:35:02,864 --> 00:35:04,834
- What was it? - Was it "What should I do?"

906
00:35:05,294 --> 00:35:07,604
- It was "What should I do?" - I thought "I can't understand."

907
00:35:07,794 --> 00:35:09,764
He asked Jung Seok to tell him.

908
00:35:09,764 --> 00:35:10,894
- It's not fair. - Yes, it is.

909
00:35:10,894 --> 00:35:11,934
It's Nap Deuk, isn't it?

910
00:35:11,934 --> 00:35:15,264
Gosh, what's wrong with your hairstyle?

911
00:35:15,634 --> 00:35:18,394
- Spare it for your blind dates. - What's this?

912
00:35:18,394 --> 00:35:19,464
(Then he says...)

913
00:35:19,464 --> 00:35:21,764
What should I do with you?

914
00:35:21,934 --> 00:35:23,164
Take this.

915
00:35:23,564 --> 00:35:25,634
- It's Nap Deuk. - Try it, please.

916
00:35:25,634 --> 00:35:28,464
"What should I do with you?"

917
00:35:28,534 --> 00:35:29,564
"What should I do with you?"

918
00:35:29,564 --> 00:35:31,194
I just remember this.

919
00:35:31,194 --> 00:35:33,534
- Me too. That was impressive. - It was very impressive.

920
00:35:33,534 --> 00:35:35,394
"Like this."

921
00:35:35,494 --> 00:35:38,034
- Can he show us again? - Please show us.

922
00:35:38,104 --> 00:35:39,794
- Oh my. - "Like this."

923
00:35:39,794 --> 00:35:41,664
Please show us, Jung Seok.

924
00:35:43,894 --> 00:35:48,634
(Nap Deuk's lecture of Kiss 101 begins.)

925
00:35:48,634 --> 00:35:51,134
When you kiss...

926
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:57,634
Your tongue and mine slither in naturally...

927
00:35:58,064 --> 00:35:59,834
like snakes. You know what snakes are, right?

928
00:36:00,794 --> 00:36:01,894
And you rub them together.

929
00:36:01,894 --> 00:36:03,264
(Rub the snakes.)

930
00:36:03,264 --> 00:36:04,934
Rub them so hard.

931
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:08,964
Push forward and backward. Go sideways, too.

932
00:36:09,664 --> 00:36:11,604
- It's fantastic. - "What should I do with you?"

933
00:36:11,764 --> 00:36:14,534
"What should I do?"

934
00:36:14,534 --> 00:36:16,264
"What should I do?"

935
00:36:16,264 --> 00:36:18,764
(Thank you for your easy explanation of a difficult topic.)

936
00:36:18,764 --> 00:36:20,394
- He's so good. - He is.

937
00:36:20,394 --> 00:36:21,864
He is great.

938
00:36:21,894 --> 00:36:23,294
That was funny.

939
00:36:23,294 --> 00:36:25,894
- Now, it's the last question. - Let's win.

940
00:36:25,894 --> 00:36:27,634
- You'll have to dance this time. - Okay.

941
00:36:27,634 --> 00:36:31,064
What do you think of this picture? In 1, 2, 3.

942
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:32,794
(What does this picture mean?)

943
00:36:32,794 --> 00:36:35,634
- There is a horse in the ear. - I know.

944
00:36:35,864 --> 00:36:37,464
Is it an ear or what?

945
00:36:37,994 --> 00:36:39,604
I'll try to answer.

946
00:36:39,604 --> 00:36:41,794
I figured it out.

947
00:36:42,134 --> 00:36:43,464
The song you'll dance to is...

948
00:36:43,464 --> 00:36:46,034
(He can answer if he just dances well.)

949
00:36:46,264 --> 00:36:48,064
(What is this?)

950
00:36:48,064 --> 00:36:49,064
(Is it a dance or an exorcism?)

951
00:36:49,064 --> 00:36:50,694
- That's not the right dance. - Get in.

952
00:36:50,694 --> 00:36:52,534
- Why? - Get in.

953
00:36:52,564 --> 00:36:55,134
- This is similar. - Aren't you sorry to Kyung Soo?

954
00:36:55,134 --> 00:36:56,564
- I was doing it right. - Hey.

955
00:36:56,894 --> 00:36:58,604
Kyung Soo.

956
00:36:58,604 --> 00:37:00,364
- Please come here. - Please show us.

957
00:37:00,364 --> 00:37:01,834
Let's see the dance of an EXO member.

958
00:37:01,834 --> 00:37:03,064
Try to dance with Kyung Soo.

959
00:37:03,064 --> 00:37:04,464
- Let's see all five dance. - You'll be surprised.

960
00:37:04,464 --> 00:37:05,764
There will be no big difference.

961
00:37:06,034 --> 00:37:08,534
Show us the original dance, Kyung Soo.

962
00:37:08,534 --> 00:37:11,104
(Go, D.O. of EXO.)

963
00:37:11,934 --> 00:37:14,364
(This is the original dance.)

964
00:37:14,364 --> 00:37:15,894
(He is a mess.)

965
00:37:15,894 --> 00:37:18,064
- Like this? - It is totally different.

966
00:37:19,064 --> 00:37:21,464
- There is a big difference. - There is.

967
00:37:21,464 --> 00:37:22,834
(Isn't this how you do it?)

968
00:37:22,834 --> 00:37:23,894
What are you doing?

969
00:37:24,264 --> 00:37:26,294
- What's he doing? - Didn't you see Kyung Soo?

970
00:37:26,294 --> 00:37:27,464
This is it.

971
00:37:28,434 --> 00:37:29,764
(Kwang Soo wants to hit him.)

972
00:37:31,694 --> 00:37:33,634
- We will dance together. - To "Growl".

973
00:37:33,734 --> 00:37:35,664
- Kyung Soo, watch us dance. - Yes.

974
00:37:35,664 --> 00:37:36,964
Choose the best dancer.

975
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:38,434
(It's a dance competition.)

976
00:37:40,934 --> 00:37:42,364
Kyung Soo should teach them how to dance.

977
00:37:43,364 --> 00:37:46,104
You're in the way. Get out of the way.

978
00:37:46,394 --> 00:37:47,604
Get out.

979
00:37:47,604 --> 00:37:49,794
(Do you hear the EXO fans growling in anger?)

980
00:37:50,694 --> 00:37:52,164
- Get out of the way. - Okay.

981
00:37:52,164 --> 00:37:53,664
- What is this? - Haha gets the chance.

982
00:37:53,664 --> 00:37:58,264
(What's Haha's answer to the picture?)

983
00:37:58,264 --> 00:37:59,264
A horse riding game.

984
00:37:59,264 --> 00:38:00,894
- What are you talking about? - What?

985
00:38:00,894 --> 00:38:02,364
(It's the wrong answer.)

986
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:03,994
- Me. - Me.

987
00:38:03,994 --> 00:38:05,864
- Me! - I'll answer.

988
00:38:05,864 --> 00:38:07,534
Let me have a chance.

989
00:38:08,894 --> 00:38:12,334
(The dance battle of "Growl" is getting fiercer.)

990
00:38:12,334 --> 00:38:14,194
- Jae Seok, it's your turn. - Okay.

991
00:38:15,194 --> 00:38:16,294
- A whisper. - Yes.

992
00:38:17,564 --> 00:38:21,104
(Could "whisper" be the correct answer?)

993
00:38:21,104 --> 00:38:22,164
- A whisper. - Yes.

994
00:38:22,164 --> 00:38:23,664
(Could "whisper" be the correct answer?)

995
00:38:23,994 --> 00:38:25,364
I thought they were earplugs.

996
00:38:25,634 --> 00:38:27,164
I thought it was words.

997
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:28,334
Everyone had a different answer.

998
00:38:28,334 --> 00:38:30,964
Words, earplugs, a horse riding game,

999
00:38:30,964 --> 00:38:31,994
- and a whisper. - I was wrong anyway.

1000
00:38:32,064 --> 00:38:34,164
- It was a whisper. - Did you think it was earplugs?

1001
00:38:34,234 --> 00:38:36,934
- We all had different answers. - I thought of a horse riding game.

1002
00:38:36,934 --> 00:38:38,434
- You did. - My answer was "words".

1003
00:38:38,694 --> 00:38:39,794
Mine was earplugs.

1004
00:38:39,794 --> 00:38:41,034
(They all had different yet wrong answers.)

1005
00:38:41,034 --> 00:38:43,364
- But it was a whisper. - Since the horse plugged the ear?

1006
00:38:43,364 --> 00:38:44,534
Yes, I thought so.

1007
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:47,794
I thought the ear was hanging off the horse.

1008
00:38:47,794 --> 00:38:50,934
I went overboard and was mistaken.

1009
00:38:50,934 --> 00:38:52,734
(His idea was also creative.)

1010
00:38:52,894 --> 00:38:54,564
According to the final score,

1011
00:38:54,564 --> 00:38:58,364
the first place is Jae Seok and Jung Seok.

1012
00:38:58,894 --> 00:39:01,434
The second place is Jong Kook and Seok Jin.

1013
00:39:01,434 --> 00:39:03,364
The third place is Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo.

1014
00:39:03,364 --> 00:39:05,604
- I can't believe it. - It's okay, Haha.

1015
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:07,934
(They currently have a Penalty Card.)

1016
00:39:07,934 --> 00:39:09,734
We need to pick the same pair, right?

1017
00:39:09,734 --> 00:39:11,134
Right. Choose.

1018
00:39:11,194 --> 00:39:14,634
Please choose three cards you want to check.

1019
00:39:14,634 --> 00:39:16,894
- Then will we be able to check? - Yes.

1020
00:39:17,394 --> 00:39:18,764
(If you choose the same pair, you can throw them away.)

1021
00:39:18,764 --> 00:39:21,464
You can choose three cards total.

1022
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:22,734
I'll pick this one.

1023
00:39:22,964 --> 00:39:25,334
(The paired cards don't include the Penalty Cards.)

1024
00:39:26,394 --> 00:39:28,234
I'll choose the one at the end.

1025
00:39:28,234 --> 00:39:29,234
(Kiss on the Cheek Card)

1026
00:39:29,234 --> 00:39:33,364
(Tour around Daegu Card)

1027
00:39:33,364 --> 00:39:34,634
(Another Kiss on the Cheek Card)

1028
00:39:34,634 --> 00:39:37,164
(They are the same cards.)

1029
00:39:37,164 --> 00:39:39,564
The final mission is like that of Find the Robber game.

1030
00:39:39,564 --> 00:39:42,864
All you have to do is throw away all the cards that you have.

1031
00:39:42,864 --> 00:39:44,694
- We can throw them away. - Okay.

1032
00:39:45,334 --> 00:39:46,534
(The team without any cards will be the winner.)

1033
00:39:46,534 --> 00:39:48,734
(They have two Kiss on the Cheek Cards.)

1034
00:39:48,734 --> 00:39:51,234
(They have a chance to choose another three cards.)

1035
00:39:51,234 --> 00:39:52,694
Shall I pick another?

1036
00:39:52,864 --> 00:39:54,604
Please show the card to me.

1037
00:39:54,604 --> 00:39:56,794
- We should keep it secret. - I know.

1038
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:58,464
- Let's choose one. - Okay.

1039
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:01,434
(They check two cards and choose three.)

1040
00:40:01,434 --> 00:40:03,764
- Try to pick. - If you checked the two cards...

1041
00:40:03,764 --> 00:40:05,104
This is unbelievable.

1042
00:40:05,934 --> 00:40:06,994
- The cards... - We can avoid the Penalty Cards.

1043
00:40:06,994 --> 00:40:09,034
- I see. - This is great.

1044
00:40:09,134 --> 00:40:12,534
(They picked three and can throw away two of them.)

1045
00:40:12,604 --> 00:40:15,604
Choose the three cards you want to take.

1046
00:40:15,604 --> 00:40:18,764
(They checked just one card and try to choose three.)

1047
00:40:19,964 --> 00:40:21,734
(It's the Penalty Card.)

1048
00:40:21,734 --> 00:40:23,994
(Oh my gosh.)

1049
00:40:23,994 --> 00:40:25,334
You're so unlucky.

1050
00:40:25,964 --> 00:40:28,734
You should avoid this card.

1051
00:40:28,734 --> 00:40:30,064
(They have a Charm Card and a Penalty Card.)

1052
00:40:30,064 --> 00:40:31,464
Like this?

1053
00:40:31,464 --> 00:40:33,064
(Kiss on the Cheek Card)

1054
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:35,164
(Tour around Daegu Card)

1055
00:40:35,164 --> 00:40:36,764
(They don't even have the same cards.)

1056
00:40:38,364 --> 00:40:42,134
(Haha and Ji Hyo automatically get the rest of the cards.)

1057
00:40:42,134 --> 00:40:46,264
(This is the status of the cards each team has.)

1058
00:40:46,264 --> 00:40:49,134
This is round three and it's the last one before the final race.

1059
00:40:49,134 --> 00:40:50,664
It's "Night Market Bingo".

1060
00:40:50,894 --> 00:40:52,064
- "Night Market"? - Great.

1061
00:40:52,194 --> 00:40:54,864
- There are a lot of delicious food. - I was so hungry.

1062
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:58,464
The winner of this mission will get an Exchange Card.

1063
00:40:58,494 --> 00:41:00,964
You don't just check them but exchange them.

1064
00:41:00,964 --> 00:41:02,064
An Exchange Card?

1065
00:41:02,664 --> 00:41:05,494
You can exchange your whole stack...

1066
00:41:05,494 --> 00:41:07,534
with the team you want anytime.

1067
00:41:07,534 --> 00:41:08,834
- What? - The whole cards?

1068
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:11,264
Anytime? Even right before the end?

1069
00:41:11,264 --> 00:41:13,664
Then this is an important round.

1070
00:41:13,894 --> 00:41:14,934
To survive...

1071
00:41:15,734 --> 00:41:18,394
- "To survive"? - What should you do to survive?

1072
00:41:18,394 --> 00:41:20,994
- "To survive"? - Is this the only way to survive?

1073
00:41:21,264 --> 00:41:23,794
- What do you mean by that? - Were you dying?

1074
00:41:25,034 --> 00:41:26,104
Well...

1075
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:28,364
- You have a Penalty Card, right? - Kwang Soo told me...

1076
00:41:28,604 --> 00:41:30,104
to pretend not to have them.

1077
00:41:30,334 --> 00:41:31,334
(Kwang Soo is flustered.)

1078
00:41:31,334 --> 00:41:33,164
We don't know the result yet.

1079
00:41:33,434 --> 00:41:35,064
- Nobody knows. - They have them.

1080
00:41:35,064 --> 00:41:37,464
- I think now we all know. - No.

1081
00:41:37,664 --> 00:41:41,064
Using the hints of the pictures on the bingo board,

1082
00:41:41,064 --> 00:41:43,394
visit the relevant store and complete the mission.

1083
00:41:43,394 --> 00:41:47,664
The fist team to complete a row is the winner.

1084
00:41:47,694 --> 00:41:51,634
Every time you clear the mission, we'll put the sticker of your team.

1085
00:41:51,694 --> 00:41:55,664
You can't challenge the store with a sticker anymore.

1086
00:41:55,664 --> 00:41:57,864
- Other teams can't challenge it. - Really?

1087
00:41:57,864 --> 00:42:00,604
And from now, while you're racing in this round,

1088
00:42:00,664 --> 00:42:04,064
the staff will scatter around, visit stores and eat food there.

1089
00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:06,394
- The final penalty is... - Paying the bill.

1090
00:42:06,394 --> 00:42:08,294
- That's right. - Oh my gosh.

1091
00:42:08,294 --> 00:42:10,364
Before that, as a practice,

1092
00:42:10,364 --> 00:42:13,604
we'll let you play a few games with a bingo board here.

1093
00:42:13,604 --> 00:42:14,864
As a practice.

1094
00:42:14,864 --> 00:42:16,194
- Here. - I'll have an advantage.

1095
00:42:16,194 --> 00:42:18,394
Please choose a game that you're very good at.

1096
00:42:18,764 --> 00:42:20,794
- Something you'll definitely win. - I'm good at jegichagi.

1097
00:42:21,964 --> 00:42:24,104
(Jung Seok is a very talented brother.)

1098
00:42:24,104 --> 00:42:26,394
What should I do with Jung Seok?

1099
00:42:26,564 --> 00:42:27,734
He is awesome.

1100
00:42:28,234 --> 00:42:30,264
It's done. We decided.

1101
00:42:30,264 --> 00:42:32,494
- What is it? - We'll do jegichagi.

1102
00:42:32,494 --> 00:42:34,234
- Jegichagi? - Is he good at it?

1103
00:42:34,234 --> 00:42:35,494
- Yes. - Don't you need that?

1104
00:42:36,734 --> 00:42:38,104
What about enduring the pain after hammered?

1105
00:42:38,234 --> 00:42:40,104
What do you think?

1106
00:42:40,104 --> 00:42:41,134
(Do you want to endure it first?)

1107
00:42:41,294 --> 00:42:43,734
(They're practicing hard.)

1108
00:42:44,264 --> 00:42:46,264
I think it'll be okay. But it's too fast.

1109
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:48,194
All right. Let's do this.

1110
00:42:48,264 --> 00:42:50,194
- Can I practice it? - Yes, you can.

1111
00:42:52,334 --> 00:42:54,064
There you go.

1112
00:42:54,394 --> 00:42:57,394
It's okay. Don't exhaust yourself. Get some rest.

1113
00:42:58,194 --> 00:43:00,564
(You can be an ace with only five in Running Man.)

1114
00:43:00,564 --> 00:43:02,464
We're doing jegichagi.

1115
00:43:02,464 --> 00:43:04,334
- Is he good at jegichagi? - Yes.

1116
00:43:04,334 --> 00:43:06,034
- He is good. - Is he?

1117
00:43:06,034 --> 00:43:07,194
This is samgyeopsal.

1118
00:43:07,194 --> 00:43:09,464
- This is rolled samgyeopsal. - It is.

1119
00:43:09,694 --> 00:43:11,034
In this game...

1120
00:43:11,034 --> 00:43:12,534
Isn't it sundae?

1121
00:43:13,164 --> 00:43:14,834
(Everyone can't help but stand in awe.)

1122
00:43:14,834 --> 00:43:17,194
- This is rolled samgyeopsal. - It is.

1123
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:20,234
It'll be a random choice.

1124
00:43:20,234 --> 00:43:23,894
(Who are the hosts of the first game?)

1125
00:43:24,994 --> 00:43:26,194
Kwang Soo's team, go first.

1126
00:43:26,634 --> 00:43:27,964
- Yes! - It's them.

1127
00:43:27,964 --> 00:43:30,994
- It is face to face jump rope. - That's what you wrote.

1128
00:43:30,994 --> 00:43:33,994
That's what you wrote. In fact, if you put a snack in your mouth,

1129
00:43:33,994 --> 00:43:36,364
- it'll be more fun. - He's right.

1130
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:38,064
- With a snack in our mouths... - Kwang Soo...

1131
00:43:38,464 --> 00:43:41,034
Because I'm short, I think it's not a good idea.

1132
00:43:41,034 --> 00:43:42,264
Then do as you wish.

1133
00:43:42,734 --> 00:43:44,664
We'll just do jump rope face to face.

1134
00:43:46,764 --> 00:43:47,894
- That is funny. - Okay.

1135
00:43:47,894 --> 00:43:49,364
- He's a new type. - Do something you can do well.

1136
00:43:49,464 --> 00:43:50,834
Which team do you want to fight with?

1137
00:43:51,634 --> 00:43:53,564
Jong Kook's team.

1138
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:55,964
- We're very good. - Us?

1139
00:43:55,964 --> 00:43:58,434
- You're clueless. - You don't know anything.

1140
00:43:58,434 --> 00:44:00,264
Start right away.

1141
00:44:00,834 --> 00:44:03,164
Are you ready? Ready.

1142
00:44:03,634 --> 00:44:05,964
- You can do this. - Ready...

1143
00:44:06,094 --> 00:44:07,364
Does anyone want to cheer for them?

1144
00:44:07,364 --> 00:44:08,534
- No. - Okay.

1145
00:44:09,034 --> 00:44:10,664
No one wants to cheer for them?

1146
00:44:10,664 --> 00:44:11,764
- Right. - Why should we?

1147
00:44:11,764 --> 00:44:12,834
Ready,

1148
00:44:13,334 --> 00:44:17,534
set, go.

1149
00:44:18,994 --> 00:44:20,734
(Please get stuck.)

1150
00:44:22,164 --> 00:44:23,234
Go.

1151
00:44:23,834 --> 00:44:24,934
(Gosh)

1152
00:44:26,064 --> 00:44:27,464
(They failed to jump even once.)

1153
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:28,864
This is great.

1154
00:44:29,434 --> 00:44:31,334
- It's done. - No. This is not right.

1155
00:44:31,334 --> 00:44:33,394
- We didn't even practice. - Okay. You got zero.

1156
00:44:33,394 --> 00:44:34,994
- I wanted some practice before. - It couldn't be helped.

1157
00:44:34,994 --> 00:44:36,834
- We should have practiced. - Stop being stubborn.

1158
00:44:36,834 --> 00:44:39,064
(Jong Kook can't accept his poor result.)

1159
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:41,094
- If they score zero as well... - It can happen.

1160
00:44:41,094 --> 00:44:42,564
They may get zero, too. This game is quite difficult.

1161
00:44:42,564 --> 00:44:45,834
All right. Will anyone cheer for them?

1162
00:44:45,834 --> 00:44:46,964
- No. - I won't.

1163
00:44:46,964 --> 00:44:48,294
- He'll hit Kwang Soo with his head. - Get ready.

1164
00:44:48,294 --> 00:44:50,394
- Jump once to win. - That jump rope is really short.

1165
00:44:50,394 --> 00:44:51,694
Just jump once.

1166
00:44:52,164 --> 00:44:53,434
- All right. Ready, - They will fail.

1167
00:44:53,864 --> 00:44:54,994
set, go.

1168
00:44:54,994 --> 00:44:57,364
(They only need to jump once to win. Will they succeed?)

1169
00:44:58,194 --> 00:45:00,334
(Please fall down. I know you will, Kwang Soo.)

1170
00:45:00,334 --> 00:45:01,494
Set, go.

1171
00:45:03,964 --> 00:45:06,064
(That was a complete mess.)

1172
00:45:08,194 --> 00:45:09,434
What's wrong? You were better last time.

1173
00:45:09,734 --> 00:45:11,064
- All right. Then... - Please. Give us another chance.

1174
00:45:11,064 --> 00:45:12,394
- Another chance? - That's what we asked for, too.

1175
00:45:12,394 --> 00:45:14,234
No way. You can't practice before a round.

1176
00:45:14,234 --> 00:45:15,594
- Will you swing the jump rope? - Who was it?

1177
00:45:15,594 --> 00:45:17,734
- Was it me? - Yes. You got tripped over.

1178
00:45:17,734 --> 00:45:20,394
It's really hard to jump even once because this jump rope is so short.

1179
00:45:20,464 --> 00:45:22,334
Kyung Soo is really annoyed right now.

1180
00:45:22,334 --> 00:45:23,734
- No, he's not. - Let's skip once at least.

1181
00:45:24,064 --> 00:45:25,234
- Was it me? Really? - Get ready.

1182
00:45:25,234 --> 00:45:26,364
- That jump rope is too short. - Jump like this.

1183
00:45:26,364 --> 00:45:29,294
(It's their second time trying. They must be better than the last time.)

1184
00:45:29,294 --> 00:45:30,664
Ready, set, go.

1185
00:45:32,494 --> 00:45:33,564
We skipped once.

1186
00:45:34,864 --> 00:45:35,994
We skipped once.

1187
00:45:35,994 --> 00:45:37,694
We did it. We did one.

1188
00:45:37,764 --> 00:45:39,734
- You sound so happy. - Just do as you did before.

1189
00:45:40,194 --> 00:45:41,934
Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo may lose.

1190
00:45:42,294 --> 00:45:43,664
You must skip twice to win.

1191
00:45:44,394 --> 00:45:46,194
I feel nervous only because I need to skip ropes just twice.

1192
00:45:46,194 --> 00:45:48,494
- They only need to skip twice. - Be careful when you jump.

1193
00:45:48,494 --> 00:45:51,664
Kyung Soo looks really desperate.

1194
00:45:51,734 --> 00:45:53,034
- Jump as high as you can. - Ready, set...

1195
00:45:53,394 --> 00:45:57,094
(Will Jong Kook's team win or will it be a draw?)

1196
00:45:57,094 --> 00:45:58,234
Set, go.

1197
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:00,464
One. Are you okay?

1198
00:46:01,694 --> 00:46:02,764
(Kwang Soo bumps into Kyung Soo.)

1199
00:46:05,864 --> 00:46:07,194
What? Did they skip once?

1200
00:46:07,294 --> 00:46:08,894
Their knees bumped into each other.

1201
00:46:09,394 --> 00:46:11,394
This match is strangely intense.

1202
00:46:11,594 --> 00:46:12,594
It's a draw now.

1203
00:46:12,594 --> 00:46:13,834
(They sacrificed their knees to get a draw.)

1204
00:46:13,834 --> 00:46:15,534
- Are you all right? - I told you...

1205
00:46:16,494 --> 00:46:18,394
that our knees may bump into each other.

1206
00:46:19,094 --> 00:46:20,994
(It's a really intense match. The third round begins.)

1207
00:46:20,994 --> 00:46:22,464
Set, go.

1208
00:46:22,764 --> 00:46:23,764
Set, go.

1209
00:46:24,464 --> 00:46:25,494
- Gosh. - What was that?

1210
00:46:26,734 --> 00:46:27,994
(Gosh)

1211
00:46:28,864 --> 00:46:29,894
(Jong Kook's inside is boiling with anger.)

1212
00:46:29,894 --> 00:46:31,494
Now is your chance. Chance to win.

1213
00:46:31,734 --> 00:46:33,234
This is the biggest chance you will ever have.

1214
00:46:33,234 --> 00:46:34,594
It seriously is. Grab it.

1215
00:46:34,594 --> 00:46:37,634
- We must get this. We must. - Just do as you did before.

1216
00:46:37,634 --> 00:46:39,464
- Ready... - Jong Kook. This isn't easy at all.

1217
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:41,664
- I minded my knees. - Ready, set...

1218
00:46:42,164 --> 00:46:44,034
- Seok Jin, please step back. - We don't know the result yet.

1219
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:45,694
- Let's have another match. - Ready,

1220
00:46:45,694 --> 00:46:47,834
- Come on, Kwang Soo. - set, go.

1221
00:46:47,834 --> 00:46:51,794
(Win and fill the bingo card!)

1222
00:46:52,534 --> 00:46:54,764
- Come on, Kwang Soo. - Set, go.

1223
00:46:54,764 --> 00:46:55,964
- They did... - Yes.

1224
00:46:55,964 --> 00:46:59,264
(They did it!)

1225
00:46:59,534 --> 00:47:02,634
(I love you, brother. You are my prince forever.)

1226
00:47:02,634 --> 00:47:06,334
(Me, too. Stay with me forever.)

1227
00:47:06,834 --> 00:47:08,364
- We won. - Yes.

1228
00:47:08,864 --> 00:47:10,864
I never thought this game would be so interesting.

1229
00:47:10,964 --> 00:47:12,364
It was really intense.

1230
00:47:12,364 --> 00:47:13,664
(They mark one square and enjoy the food.)

1231
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:14,994
Look at that meat.

1232
00:47:14,994 --> 00:47:17,064
- That's rolled samgyeopsal. - That is rolled.

1233
00:47:17,394 --> 00:47:18,694
- They're in a better position now. - Amazing.

1234
00:47:19,464 --> 00:47:21,464
- We can't eat that anyway. - How would it taste like?

1235
00:47:22,134 --> 00:47:23,234
This is really delicious.

1236
00:47:23,234 --> 00:47:25,394
It tastes different than you might expect.

1237
00:47:26,194 --> 00:47:27,994
There isn't any rice in the filling.

1238
00:47:28,564 --> 00:47:32,464
- There are vegetables and squid. - Vegetables sounds nice.

1239
00:47:32,464 --> 00:47:33,864
- Here comes the next menu. - Goodness.

1240
00:47:33,864 --> 00:47:35,764
(Here comes the next menu from Daegu's night market.)

1241
00:47:35,764 --> 00:47:37,394
It looks really delicious.

1242
00:47:37,464 --> 00:47:40,234
- I'd like to eat that. - We were really close.

1243
00:47:40,234 --> 00:47:42,294
All right then. Wait. Jung Seok, whom should we pick?

1244
00:47:44,264 --> 00:47:45,394
- Whom should we pick? - Well...

1245
00:47:45,834 --> 00:47:47,734
- How about them? - Sounds good.

1246
00:47:48,234 --> 00:47:49,894
(Yes? Are you talking about us?)

1247
00:47:49,894 --> 00:47:52,434
- I want to take my revenge, too. - All right.

1248
00:47:52,434 --> 00:47:54,734
- Are you still resentful? - Yes, I am.

1249
00:47:54,834 --> 00:47:56,034
I was avoiding your eyes.

1250
00:47:56,094 --> 00:47:58,664
- I was looking at the floor. - You're still resentful about that.

1251
00:47:58,664 --> 00:48:00,164
- I didn't know that. - I don't think we can win.

1252
00:48:00,164 --> 00:48:02,164
We'll play jegichagi without any practice beforehand.

1253
00:48:02,164 --> 00:48:03,834
You practiced really hard over there, didn't you?

1254
00:48:03,834 --> 00:48:06,264
- The rule wasn't decided then. - I see.

1255
00:48:06,264 --> 00:48:08,264
- You can catch jegi only once. - All right.

1256
00:48:08,264 --> 00:48:10,134
- Only one of you... - So we can catch once each, right?

1257
00:48:10,134 --> 00:48:12,564
- No. You can catch it only once. - Only once? I see.

1258
00:48:12,664 --> 00:48:14,634
- We'll choose your jegi, too. - That silver-colored one...

1259
00:48:14,994 --> 00:48:16,664
- Here. - No. Give us that gold-colored one.

1260
00:48:16,964 --> 00:48:19,194
- That jegi is suffering hair loss. - What is that?

1261
00:48:19,894 --> 00:48:22,034
- What are you doing? - We'll give this for you.

1262
00:48:22,034 --> 00:48:24,164
- Hey. That's too much. - Three are too many strips here.

1263
00:48:24,164 --> 00:48:26,364
- How can you rip them off? - What's the matter?

1264
00:48:26,694 --> 00:48:29,164
- How can you do that? - We're the ones who set the rule.

1265
00:48:29,164 --> 00:48:30,334
- Come on, stop it. - Honestly, we're...

1266
00:48:30,334 --> 00:48:31,664
- Stop ripping off strips. - All right. I'll stop.

1267
00:48:31,664 --> 00:48:33,864
- Here you go. - What is this?

1268
00:48:34,294 --> 00:48:35,894
This is as bald as my head.

1269
00:48:35,894 --> 00:48:37,194
Remember. No practice.

1270
00:48:37,194 --> 00:48:38,964
Look at that. It's so thin.

1271
00:48:38,964 --> 00:48:41,594
- Be careful. You may blow it away. - This jegi is really thin.

1272
00:48:42,094 --> 00:48:44,494
- There isn't any strip left. - Okay. Just begin.

1273
00:48:44,494 --> 00:48:46,594
- I'm ready. - Ready, set, go.

1274
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:50,294
- Two. Three. - Three. What?

1275
00:48:51,334 --> 00:48:52,564
(Startled)

1276
00:48:53,064 --> 00:48:54,694
- Three. Four. - Three. Four.

1277
00:48:55,164 --> 00:48:56,594
- Five? No. - He scored four.

1278
00:48:56,594 --> 00:48:58,364
- He scored four. Amazing. - Four? That's pathetic.

1279
00:48:58,364 --> 00:49:00,364
It's so thin, so it falls down quickly.

1280
00:49:00,364 --> 00:49:01,694
Look at his face.

1281
00:49:02,294 --> 00:49:03,994
- It falls down really quickly. - Wait a minute.

1282
00:49:04,434 --> 00:49:05,834
- Just give it to me for a second. - Why?

1283
00:49:06,394 --> 00:49:07,494
Stop it.

1284
00:49:07,494 --> 00:49:10,264
(Stop ripping them off!)

1285
00:49:10,464 --> 00:49:11,664
(The jegi now looks pitiful.)

1286
00:49:11,664 --> 00:49:13,334
- How can I play with this? - You can't play with this.

1287
00:49:13,334 --> 00:49:14,664
(His jegi is ripped in pieces.)

1288
00:49:15,894 --> 00:49:17,264
All right. I'll give you another one.

1289
00:49:17,264 --> 00:49:19,134
Do you want me to pull out your hair just like that?

1290
00:49:20,734 --> 00:49:22,634
- This is thin as well. - Here. This is better.

1291
00:49:22,634 --> 00:49:24,034
This is really thin.

1292
00:49:24,034 --> 00:49:25,994
- What is that? - That jegi looks pitiful.

1293
00:49:25,994 --> 00:49:27,234
- Shall I begin? - Yes.

1294
00:49:27,234 --> 00:49:29,334
- This jegi is terrible. - Did Seok Jin score four?

1295
00:49:29,334 --> 00:49:30,594
- I'll start. - Okay.

1296
00:49:30,864 --> 00:49:33,594
- Five. Six. Seven. Eight. - Five. Six. Seven. Eight.

1297
00:49:33,594 --> 00:49:35,394
- Nine. Ten. - You can catch it if you need to.

1298
00:49:35,734 --> 00:49:37,034
- 11, 12. - Go on. You're good.

1299
00:49:37,764 --> 00:49:39,564
(Staring)

1300
00:49:39,564 --> 00:49:40,834
(What are you doing?)

1301
00:49:41,294 --> 00:49:43,134
15, 16.

1302
00:49:43,234 --> 00:49:44,234
What are you doing?

1303
00:49:45,094 --> 00:49:46,094
(Tap)

1304
00:49:46,994 --> 00:49:49,164
- I was just standing here. - He did that on purpose.

1305
00:49:49,264 --> 00:49:51,734
- I was just standing here. - That's a foul.

1306
00:49:51,734 --> 00:49:53,894
- That was mean. - Jae Seok is so mean.

1307
00:49:53,894 --> 00:49:55,464
You must step aside.

1308
00:49:55,464 --> 00:49:57,594
- You didn't tell me to. - I swear.

1309
00:49:57,594 --> 00:49:59,464
If you don't move aside this time, I'll just kick you.

1310
00:50:00,294 --> 00:50:01,934
- I mean it. - All right. I get it.

1311
00:50:01,934 --> 00:50:03,494
- Jong Kook was good. - I must play well.

1312
00:50:03,494 --> 00:50:04,864
Jung Seok. Should we play with this jegi?

1313
00:50:04,864 --> 00:50:06,064
- Yes. Play with that jegi. - Okay.

1314
00:50:06,234 --> 00:50:09,634
(This is Jae Seok and Jung Seok's turn to play.)

1315
00:50:09,634 --> 00:50:11,894
- One. Two. Three. Four... - You're really stable.

1316
00:50:11,894 --> 00:50:13,894
(Jae Seok's play seems quite solid.)

1317
00:50:15,464 --> 00:50:17,994
(Only 7? Would that be it?)

1318
00:50:18,664 --> 00:50:19,734
- Catch it. - Good.

1319
00:50:19,734 --> 00:50:23,094
(That was a good catch.)

1320
00:50:24,164 --> 00:50:25,594
- That was good, Jae Seok. - Did you see it?

1321
00:50:25,734 --> 00:50:27,294
- I caught it with style. - That surprised me.

1322
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:29,364
Now, you're starting over from zero.

1323
00:50:29,494 --> 00:50:31,164
- Do we have any more chances? - No, we don't.

1324
00:50:32,394 --> 00:50:34,434
(They can't catch their jegi now. Jae Seok gives his second try.)

1325
00:50:34,434 --> 00:50:36,164
- Three. Four. Five. Six... - We're here. Don't get near us.

1326
00:50:36,164 --> 00:50:37,634
(Jae Seok plays really comfortably.)

1327
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:38,634
- He's good. - Eight. Nine.

1328
00:50:38,634 --> 00:50:40,394
(Seok Jin is not happy.)

1329
00:50:40,394 --> 00:50:41,564
(He steps forward.)

1330
00:50:43,264 --> 00:50:44,394
- Was it 13? - Yes. You scored 13.

1331
00:50:44,394 --> 00:50:45,634
Wasn't it 23? I'm confused.

1332
00:50:45,694 --> 00:50:48,434
(Here comes the master of jegi.)

1333
00:50:49,734 --> 00:50:51,034
(Jung Seok only needs to score 10 to win this match.)

1334
00:50:51,034 --> 00:50:52,134
- You only need to score 10. - Go for 10.

1335
00:50:52,134 --> 00:50:54,234
- Is Jung Seok good? - Yes. He is really good.

1336
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:56,494
- All right. - He didn't have any practice.

1337
00:50:57,394 --> 00:50:58,734
- You only need to score 10. - Go for 10.

1338
00:50:58,734 --> 00:51:00,734
- Is Jung Seok good? - Yes. He is really good.

1339
00:51:01,064 --> 00:51:02,894
(I believe in you, my brother.)

1340
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:05,694
- One. Two. Three. - Good. There you go.

1341
00:51:06,094 --> 00:51:07,364
He looks solid.

1342
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:08,664
(He's outstanding.)

1343
00:51:08,694 --> 00:51:10,094
Seven, eight.

1344
00:51:12,594 --> 00:51:16,464
(Victory is in his hands.)

1345
00:51:17,794 --> 00:51:18,834
- Just keep going. - 10.

1346
00:51:18,834 --> 00:51:20,464
(He goes past 10.)

1347
00:51:21,394 --> 00:51:23,994
(He begins to show off as he is sure of his victory.)

1348
00:51:23,994 --> 00:51:26,064
- Amazing. Keep it going. - 16.

1349
00:51:26,064 --> 00:51:27,194
(He catches it.)

1350
00:51:27,934 --> 00:51:29,134
Amazing. Keep it going.

1351
00:51:29,134 --> 00:51:30,664
(He acts all proud.)

1352
00:51:30,664 --> 00:51:31,794
What would happen if we catch it?

1353
00:51:31,964 --> 00:51:33,894
(He caught it in his hand.)

1354
00:51:33,894 --> 00:51:38,294
(According to the rule, they can only catch it once.)

1355
00:51:38,634 --> 00:51:40,534
- He caught it. - You caught it.

1356
00:51:40,534 --> 00:51:42,534
- You caught it. Start over. - That's right. You caught it.

1357
00:51:42,534 --> 00:51:44,064
He caught it in the end.

1358
00:51:44,164 --> 00:51:46,534
- That's a foul. - You caught it again.

1359
00:51:46,534 --> 00:51:49,734
We already used our chance. What should we do?

1360
00:51:50,234 --> 00:51:53,234
(What would be the referee's call?)

1361
00:51:53,234 --> 00:51:56,364
(Jae Seok's team loses.)

1362
00:51:56,534 --> 00:51:57,894
(Did we lose? Really?)

1363
00:51:57,894 --> 00:52:00,694
(Justice always prevails.)

1364
00:52:00,864 --> 00:52:02,834
- We won. - I'm sorry.

1365
00:52:03,094 --> 00:52:04,834
- Why did you show off like that? - I'm terribly sorry.

1366
00:52:04,834 --> 00:52:05,834
Why did you pretend as if you didn't do it?

1367
00:52:05,834 --> 00:52:07,294
He tried to do it again.

1368
00:52:07,294 --> 00:52:08,534
- That was close. - Why did you do that?

1369
00:52:08,534 --> 00:52:11,394
I was certain that we won and got too excited.

1370
00:52:11,464 --> 00:52:15,294
(They lose the game because he showed off after his victory.)

1371
00:52:16,394 --> 00:52:19,334
(Seok Jin's team can mark one square and enjoy their bindaetteok.)

1372
00:52:19,334 --> 00:52:21,494
- Jung Seok did really well but... - Why did you do that?

1373
00:52:21,494 --> 00:52:23,194
I thought he was telling me to eat...

1374
00:52:23,364 --> 00:52:24,634
but he's just eating everything.

1375
00:52:24,634 --> 00:52:27,234
(It's delicious enough to forget about petty teammates.)

1376
00:52:27,234 --> 00:52:28,564
We must win for food.

1377
00:52:28,564 --> 00:52:30,994
- That looks amazing. - Let me correct you.

1378
00:52:31,734 --> 00:52:34,464
(That was supposed to be ours.)

1379
00:52:34,464 --> 00:52:36,794
If we take this square, then they can't win easily.

1380
00:52:36,794 --> 00:52:37,834
We should mark this square.

1381
00:52:37,834 --> 00:52:40,164
- You're right. - What would you like to do?

1382
00:52:40,164 --> 00:52:41,164
(Jae Seok successfully steals a sheet of bindaetteok.)

1383
00:52:43,694 --> 00:52:46,134
- We must keep the possibility open. - We'll mark this square.

1384
00:52:46,834 --> 00:52:49,794
(Hurry up, Jung Seok. Turn around and eat.)

1385
00:52:49,794 --> 00:52:51,964
- What are you doing? - What do you think you are doing?

1386
00:52:51,964 --> 00:52:53,734
(Jae Seok is caught at the scene of the crime.)

1387
00:52:53,734 --> 00:52:55,234
- What are you doing? - What's the matter?

1388
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:57,694
- What's the problem? - When did you take it?

1389
00:52:57,894 --> 00:52:59,094
Won't you spare us some?

1390
00:52:59,094 --> 00:53:00,264
Why did you take the sauce?

1391
00:53:00,264 --> 00:53:02,934
- To eat with bindaetteok. - It was right in front of him.

1392
00:53:04,094 --> 00:53:05,334
You wanted the sauce...

1393
00:53:05,334 --> 00:53:07,764
They caught you because you took the sauce which was right here.

1394
00:53:07,764 --> 00:53:09,434
I thought they wouldn't be able to notice me.

1395
00:53:09,834 --> 00:53:11,094
- All right. - Jung Seok...

1396
00:53:11,094 --> 00:53:12,734
- is driving me mad. - Let's eat.

1397
00:53:13,834 --> 00:53:16,694
(After that, they have a fierce wrap battle to win drinks...)

1398
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:19,764
(and Kyung Soo finishes first and wins both marks and prizes.)

1399
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:23,834
(Haha's team and Jae Seok's team haven't got any marks yet.)

1400
00:53:24,564 --> 00:53:25,834
This place is...

1401
00:53:26,664 --> 00:53:28,234
just amazing.

1402
00:53:28,234 --> 00:53:30,864
- There are so many snack carts. - It's awesome.

1403
00:53:30,864 --> 00:53:35,264
This street is 350m long with about 70 snack carts.

1404
00:53:35,264 --> 00:53:37,234
Really? Is it that long?

1405
00:53:37,234 --> 00:53:41,594
(This night market is surely big, but moreover,)

1406
00:53:42,064 --> 00:53:46,594
(there are tons of delicious food.)

1407
00:53:46,594 --> 00:53:48,164
- Are there carts on this side, too? - Yes.

1408
00:53:48,164 --> 00:53:49,534
- There are carts all the way. - There are so many of them.

1409
00:53:50,564 --> 00:53:53,234
- That looks so delicious. - There are about 70 snack carts.

1410
00:53:53,234 --> 00:53:57,564
Find appropriate carts, carry out missions, and mark your bingo cards.

1411
00:53:57,564 --> 00:53:58,734
- Let's go there first. - Okay.

1412
00:53:59,864 --> 00:54:02,334
(We must stop Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo first.)

1413
00:54:02,334 --> 00:54:04,494
- Find sushi cart first. Okay? - All right.

1414
00:54:04,494 --> 00:54:05,934
(The second half of "Night Market Bingo" begins.)

1415
00:54:05,934 --> 00:54:07,294
Run and scan the carts.

1416
00:54:08,094 --> 00:54:11,164
(They need to be quick at finding carts with missions.)

1417
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:12,564
Where's the cart with tornado potatoes?

1418
00:54:12,964 --> 00:54:15,164
Excuse me. Where can I find tornado potatoes?

1419
00:54:15,164 --> 00:54:16,794
(Kwang Soo's team can almost secure victory.)

1420
00:54:17,864 --> 00:54:19,394
- Where's the cart? - Where can I find tornado potatoes?

1421
00:54:19,394 --> 00:54:20,864
(I won't let you win that easily, Kwang Soo!)

1422
00:54:22,264 --> 00:54:24,164
(Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo are on their way to find tornado potatoes.)

1423
00:54:24,634 --> 00:54:25,894
Here's a sushi cart.

1424
00:54:26,164 --> 00:54:27,694
- This must be the place. - Hello.

1425
00:54:27,794 --> 00:54:29,094
- Is this the right place? - Yes.

1426
00:54:29,094 --> 00:54:30,464
(They find fire sushi.)

1427
00:54:30,464 --> 00:54:31,664
We just need to find tornado potatoes.

1428
00:54:32,994 --> 00:54:34,664
It looks so good.

1429
00:54:34,664 --> 00:54:37,634
(A slice of beef is cooked directly with fire.)

1430
00:54:37,664 --> 00:54:39,134
It's the flank?

1431
00:54:39,134 --> 00:54:40,964
(The cooked beef gets placed on the rice.)

1432
00:54:41,764 --> 00:54:43,734
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1433
00:54:43,734 --> 00:54:48,734
(For this mission, they both have to light a match with one try.)

1434
00:54:51,534 --> 00:54:54,394
(We'll do the mission after we eat.)

1435
00:54:54,394 --> 00:54:55,394
It's good.

1436
00:54:55,764 --> 00:54:56,934
It's so good.

1437
00:54:57,564 --> 00:54:59,534
(It's got a fiery taste to it.)

1438
00:55:00,294 --> 00:55:02,464
(When are you planning on doing the mission?)

1439
00:55:02,464 --> 00:55:03,564
It's so good.

1440
00:55:03,564 --> 00:55:05,234
It is.

1441
00:55:05,464 --> 00:55:06,864
- Thank you. - Did you finish?

1442
00:55:06,864 --> 00:55:08,264
- Yes. - This is the mission.

1443
00:55:08,294 --> 00:55:10,364
- What? - It's our mission.

1444
00:55:11,394 --> 00:55:13,164
- I'll do it. - We have to light it with one try.

1445
00:55:13,164 --> 00:55:15,034
- I'll go. - You both have to do it.

1446
00:55:15,634 --> 00:55:17,034
- Here I go. - You can't fail.

1447
00:55:17,034 --> 00:55:18,064
Let's go.

1448
00:55:18,534 --> 00:55:19,564
Set, go!

1449
00:55:20,934 --> 00:55:21,964
Mission successful.

1450
00:55:22,464 --> 00:55:24,094
I have to do it, too, right?

1451
00:55:24,094 --> 00:55:30,764
(Kwang Soo can't afford to fail now.)

1452
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,134
(He lights it.)

1453
00:55:33,294 --> 00:55:35,864
(Kwang Soo succeeds from a single try.)

1454
00:55:35,864 --> 00:55:36,864
Mission success.

1455
00:55:37,564 --> 00:55:39,564
- Can you mark it on our bingo? - Okay.

1456
00:55:39,564 --> 00:55:41,764
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1457
00:55:41,894 --> 00:55:43,634
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1458
00:55:43,634 --> 00:55:44,864
Thank you for the food.

1459
00:55:44,864 --> 00:55:47,864
(They're headed to the tornado potatoes.)

1460
00:55:47,864 --> 00:55:49,834
- Let's go. - We need to find tornado potatoes.

1461
00:55:49,834 --> 00:55:51,934
I'll be with you in a minute.

1462
00:55:52,034 --> 00:55:53,534
Where are the tornado potatoes?

1463
00:55:53,534 --> 00:55:54,764
- There they are. Is this the place? - Yes.

1464
00:55:54,764 --> 00:55:56,334
- Hello. - Hello.

1465
00:55:56,534 --> 00:55:58,094
(They finally find the tornado potatoes place.)

1466
00:55:58,864 --> 00:55:59,864
What if this isn't the place?

1467
00:56:00,534 --> 00:56:02,894
(They got their hands on tornado potatoes.)

1468
00:56:03,294 --> 00:56:04,294
There they are.

1469
00:56:06,394 --> 00:56:07,394
Can you feed me some?

1470
00:56:08,094 --> 00:56:09,094
Hello.

1471
00:56:09,264 --> 00:56:10,294
Hello.

1472
00:56:10,564 --> 00:56:11,964
They must be doing a mission.

1473
00:56:12,564 --> 00:56:14,034
- Please. Just this once. - We finished it.

1474
00:56:15,394 --> 00:56:16,564
Oh, right.

1475
00:56:16,564 --> 00:56:18,294
Don't let them see.

1476
00:56:18,294 --> 00:56:19,364
What?

1477
00:56:19,364 --> 00:56:22,064
(For this mission, they have to juggle 3 potatoes at least 5 times.)

1478
00:56:22,064 --> 00:56:23,694
It's a hard mission.

1479
00:56:24,094 --> 00:56:25,094
This is difficult than the one before.

1480
00:56:25,094 --> 00:56:26,734
They won't be able to do it, either.

1481
00:56:26,734 --> 00:56:27,734
How are we supposed to do this?

1482
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,594
You have to stop them from making a bingo.

1483
00:56:31,294 --> 00:56:33,534
(Haha tries the juggling mission.)

1484
00:56:34,264 --> 00:56:35,264
(He drops them.)

1485
00:56:37,134 --> 00:56:38,164
What about us?

1486
00:56:38,694 --> 00:56:40,064
- Can you juggle, Jung Seok? - Yes.

1487
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:41,664
- Nice. - I'm good at juggling.

1488
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:42,734
Jung Seok is taking his jacket off.

1489
00:56:42,734 --> 00:56:44,394
This is so unfair.

1490
00:56:44,664 --> 00:56:47,394
You can do it, Kyung Soo. You're on fire today.

1491
00:56:47,394 --> 00:56:48,534
I'm not sure.

1492
00:56:48,534 --> 00:56:53,634
(If they succeed this mission, they will get the Exchange Card.)

1493
00:56:53,634 --> 00:56:54,634
Start!

1494
00:56:56,834 --> 00:56:58,934
(He juggled twice.)

1495
00:56:58,934 --> 00:57:00,164
- Nice. - Okay.

1496
00:57:00,264 --> 00:57:01,664
- It's our turn. - Is it hard?

1497
00:57:01,664 --> 00:57:02,764
Give us the potatoes.

1498
00:57:03,134 --> 00:57:04,564
- We don't want a lot. - Thank you for the food.

1499
00:57:04,564 --> 00:57:06,464
- Thank you for the food. - This one is too good to pass.

1500
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:08,094
It's the only one left to make a bingo.

1501
00:57:08,094 --> 00:57:10,964
Jung Seok says he knows how to juggle.

1502
00:57:10,964 --> 00:57:12,964
(Jung Seok is apparently an experienced juggler.)

1503
00:57:12,964 --> 00:57:14,264
Please.

1504
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:16,134
I haven't done it in a while.

1505
00:57:19,094 --> 00:57:21,994
Take your time, Jung Seok.

1506
00:57:21,994 --> 00:57:23,664
Is there anything he's not good at?

1507
00:57:23,664 --> 00:57:25,664
Jung Seok is an amazing guy.

1508
00:57:25,664 --> 00:57:26,794
He's amazing.

1509
00:57:28,134 --> 00:57:32,734
(Give me strength, potatoes.)

1510
00:57:33,734 --> 00:57:36,994
(I have faith in you, Jung Seok.)

1511
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:41,094
(The potatoes are dancing in the air.)

1512
00:57:42,494 --> 00:57:43,494
- He did it. - Mission successful.

1513
00:57:43,494 --> 00:57:45,964
(Jung Seok succeeds the juggling mission.)

1514
00:57:46,634 --> 00:57:47,634
Yes!

1515
00:57:47,994 --> 00:57:50,664
Way to go. That was amazing.

1516
00:57:50,664 --> 00:57:52,494
- We're doomed. - Thank you for the food.

1517
00:57:52,664 --> 00:57:54,464
- Thank you. - We're done for.

1518
00:57:54,464 --> 00:57:55,634
(They prevent Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo from making a bingo.)

1519
00:57:58,464 --> 00:58:01,134
There's so much delicious food here.

1520
00:58:01,134 --> 00:58:03,164
- Look. It's chicken skewers. - Right.

1521
00:58:03,164 --> 00:58:04,394
- Welcome. - Hello.

1522
00:58:04,394 --> 00:58:06,034
Is this the place for the mission?

1523
00:58:06,034 --> 00:58:08,094
- That's right. - Okay.

1524
00:58:08,394 --> 00:58:09,834
(Play a game of palm wrestling against a different team and win.)

1525
00:58:09,834 --> 00:58:11,064
It's palm wrestling.

1526
00:58:11,664 --> 00:58:13,134
(They fuel up with some chicken skewers.)

1527
00:58:13,134 --> 00:58:14,164
Have some more.

1528
00:58:14,164 --> 00:58:17,294
(They fuel up with some chicken skewers.)

1529
00:58:17,294 --> 00:58:18,364
It's good.

1530
00:58:18,364 --> 00:58:19,764
Everything's delicious here.

1531
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:21,794
Kyung Soo.

1532
00:58:21,864 --> 00:58:23,334
Kyung Soo.

1533
00:58:23,664 --> 00:58:25,534
We have to do this mission with someone else.

1534
00:58:25,534 --> 00:58:27,064
- Help us. - Sure. What is it?

1535
00:58:27,064 --> 00:58:28,064
It's palm wrestling.

1536
00:58:28,094 --> 00:58:29,264
Let's go.

1537
00:58:29,264 --> 00:58:32,464
(Will Jung Seok even be good at palm wrestling?)

1538
00:58:32,464 --> 00:58:35,364
(I'm pretty strong myself.)

1539
00:58:37,464 --> 00:58:38,464
(Slapping)

1540
00:58:40,134 --> 00:58:41,134
Wait, what?

1541
00:58:41,134 --> 00:58:42,164
(Jae Seok helps him back up.)

1542
00:58:42,864 --> 00:58:44,864
Wait, what? Is that even possible?

1543
00:58:45,094 --> 00:58:46,634
- What's wrong? - It doesn't make sense.

1544
00:58:47,264 --> 00:58:48,364
What are you talking about?

1545
00:58:48,364 --> 00:58:50,534
- Are you Neo from "Matrix"? - I'll show you one more time.

1546
00:58:50,534 --> 00:58:54,264
- He's very flexible. - What was that?

1547
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:56,064
He could even get back up from lying down.

1548
00:58:56,134 --> 00:58:57,864
That's right. He's flexible.

1549
00:58:57,864 --> 00:58:59,964
(They tease Kwang Soo with perfect teamwork.)

1550
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:02,464
- He's flexible. - You're up, Kyung Soo.

1551
00:59:03,134 --> 00:59:04,264
- Let's go, Kyung Soo. - Jung Seok.

1552
00:59:04,764 --> 00:59:05,764
You can do it, Jung Seok.

1553
00:59:06,934 --> 00:59:07,964
Jung Seok.

1554
00:59:09,564 --> 00:59:10,564
Kyung Soo.

1555
00:59:12,334 --> 00:59:14,364
(We meet again.)

1556
00:59:14,364 --> 00:59:15,394
Let's go, Kyung Soo.

1557
00:59:16,534 --> 00:59:18,794
- Kyung Soo. - Get him back.

1558
00:59:19,134 --> 00:59:20,364
He took the tornado potatoes mission from us.

1559
00:59:20,364 --> 00:59:21,534
Jung Seok.

1560
00:59:21,764 --> 00:59:22,764
Jung Seok.

1561
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:24,734
(He dodges.)

1562
00:59:25,494 --> 00:59:29,264
(Will Kyung Soo be able to get his revenge on Jung Seok?)

1563
00:59:29,264 --> 00:59:30,464
(He hugs him.)

1564
00:59:31,534 --> 00:59:33,634
(Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo succeed the mission.)

1565
00:59:33,634 --> 00:59:35,164
We did it!

1566
00:59:36,164 --> 00:59:38,364
- We won! - That was close.

1567
00:59:38,364 --> 00:59:39,534
We did it! We won.

1568
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:41,634
(The brothers were brave.)

1569
00:59:43,634 --> 00:59:45,464
- Hello. - Hello, Ma'am.

1570
00:59:45,464 --> 00:59:46,634
(They try their next mission.)

1571
00:59:47,264 --> 00:59:48,634
(He's good at drawing.)

1572
00:59:49,264 --> 00:59:50,294
Marilyn Monroe.

1573
00:59:50,634 --> 00:59:52,134
(They succeed the drawing mission with Kyung Soo's drawing.)

1574
00:59:52,134 --> 00:59:53,164
Thank you, Sir.

1575
00:59:53,964 --> 00:59:56,164
(If nobody gets a bingo, the team with the most missions wins.)

1576
00:59:56,164 --> 00:59:58,434
If we block everyone's bingo,

1577
00:59:58,564 --> 01:00:00,134
the team with the most missions done will win automatically.

1578
01:00:00,134 --> 01:00:01,264
You're right.

1579
01:00:01,394 --> 01:00:02,864
We did a lot so far.

1580
01:00:02,864 --> 01:00:03,864
We did.

1581
01:00:04,294 --> 01:00:06,094
This was a nail salon.

1582
01:00:06,194 --> 01:00:07,564
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1583
01:00:07,564 --> 01:00:09,064
(Exchange Card, here we come.)

1584
01:00:09,764 --> 01:00:11,764
The way I see it, we're done for.

1585
01:00:11,764 --> 01:00:12,934
Just enjoy it, Jae Seok.

1586
01:00:12,934 --> 01:00:13,934
Let's do that.

1587
01:00:14,164 --> 01:00:15,534
Hurry.

1588
01:00:15,864 --> 01:00:16,894
Hurry up.

1589
01:00:17,064 --> 01:00:18,464
Let's just...

1590
01:00:18,834 --> 01:00:21,794
watch other people shoot.

1591
01:00:21,834 --> 01:00:22,834
Jung Seok.

1592
01:00:22,834 --> 01:00:24,394
(Cheers, Jung Seok.)

1593
01:00:24,394 --> 01:00:26,994
We should eat. Let me know if you find something you want to try.

1594
01:00:27,734 --> 01:00:30,064
Do you want some ox blood soup?

1595
01:00:30,064 --> 01:00:31,064
Sounds good.

1596
01:00:31,264 --> 01:00:33,194
- It's good for upset stomach. - Ox blood soup is the best.

1597
01:00:33,194 --> 01:00:35,134
Can we have some ox blood soup?

1598
01:00:35,134 --> 01:00:38,194
Ox blood soup is the best.

1599
01:00:38,364 --> 01:00:40,734
- Thank you. - Thank you for the food.

1600
01:00:41,664 --> 01:00:43,734
- Eat up. - You too, Jae Seok.

1601
01:00:43,734 --> 01:00:45,564
(We should at least eat if we're going to lose anyway.)

1602
01:00:47,034 --> 01:00:49,564
The game's not over yet, Jung Seok. Who knows?

1603
01:00:50,834 --> 01:00:52,134
(What is life?)

1604
01:00:52,134 --> 01:00:55,564
I know we're in the worst possible situation,

1605
01:00:56,294 --> 01:00:58,064
- but you never know. - Right.

1606
01:00:58,134 --> 01:00:59,694
I hope people will watch my movie.

1607
01:01:01,734 --> 01:01:03,634
It'll all work out.

1608
01:01:03,634 --> 01:01:05,464
(Everything will be okay.)

1609
01:01:05,464 --> 01:01:09,734
(Their bromance is hotter than ox blood soup.)

1610
01:01:10,934 --> 01:01:12,264
(Kwang Soo's team has the most.)

1611
01:01:12,264 --> 01:01:15,094
This is the place. This is it.

1612
01:01:15,094 --> 01:01:17,334
- Thank you. - Under 20 seconds,

1613
01:01:17,664 --> 01:01:18,664
make the stickers stick on your face or your hand.

1614
01:01:20,264 --> 01:01:21,264
Let's go.

1615
01:01:21,364 --> 01:01:22,364
Ready, set, go.

1616
01:01:22,734 --> 01:01:25,434
Go like this and apply pressure.

1617
01:01:25,664 --> 01:01:26,664
Use your nails, too.

1618
01:01:26,664 --> 01:01:28,634
(They rub the stickers carefully.)

1619
01:01:28,634 --> 01:01:29,634
Please.

1620
01:01:30,094 --> 01:01:31,094
Here.

1621
01:01:31,094 --> 01:01:33,164
(The stickers have to be printed clearly for both of them.)

1622
01:01:33,164 --> 01:01:34,164
Is that it?

1623
01:01:34,164 --> 01:01:35,464
Let's take it off.

1624
01:01:36,934 --> 01:01:38,334
Oh, gosh.

1625
01:01:39,094 --> 01:01:40,834
(You're in our way.)

1626
01:01:40,834 --> 01:01:42,294
- What... - I'm sorry.

1627
01:01:42,364 --> 01:01:44,094
If you fail, we'll try right after.

1628
01:01:44,964 --> 01:01:46,094
I did it.

1629
01:01:46,394 --> 01:01:48,564
(Kyung Soo succeeds once again.)

1630
01:01:48,564 --> 01:01:49,764
It should come off easily.

1631
01:01:49,764 --> 01:01:51,094
(Kwang Soo is the only one left.)

1632
01:01:51,094 --> 01:01:52,094
Take it off.

1633
01:01:52,094 --> 01:01:53,364
(Kwang Soo is the only one left.)

1634
01:01:53,364 --> 01:01:55,134
You failed.

1635
01:01:55,164 --> 01:01:56,164
We'll try now.

1636
01:01:56,394 --> 01:01:57,664
- It's okay. - What are we doing here?

1637
01:01:57,664 --> 01:01:59,294
You should've used a new sticker.

1638
01:01:59,634 --> 01:02:01,164
It didn't feel sticky.

1639
01:02:01,164 --> 01:02:02,164
(This is not good at all.)

1640
01:02:02,164 --> 01:02:03,234
If we do this mission, we'll get a bingo.

1641
01:02:03,664 --> 01:02:05,864
- Let's go. - You just need to stay still.

1642
01:02:05,964 --> 01:02:07,464
- Give us some water. - We have 20 seconds, right?

1643
01:02:07,864 --> 01:02:09,364
Ready, set, go.

1644
01:02:09,364 --> 01:02:11,164
(Seok Jin and Jong Kook start their mission.)

1645
01:02:12,994 --> 01:02:14,134
(If they do this, they'll get a bingo.)

1646
01:02:14,134 --> 01:02:15,264
Please no.

1647
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:16,264
(If they fail, Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo could try again.)

1648
01:02:16,264 --> 01:02:17,434
If we stop their bingo, we'll win.

1649
01:02:17,664 --> 01:02:21,264
- You don't rub it? - No.

1650
01:02:21,264 --> 01:02:22,534
Just apply a lot of pressure.

1651
01:02:22,964 --> 01:02:24,364
You have to take it off now.

1652
01:02:24,364 --> 01:02:30,964
(How did they do?)

1653
01:02:31,434 --> 01:02:32,464
Oh, no.

1654
01:02:32,464 --> 01:02:34,134
(Seok Jin failed already.)

1655
01:02:35,034 --> 01:02:36,534
- Yes! - We'll try next.

1656
01:02:36,534 --> 01:02:37,794
It didn't work.

1657
01:02:37,864 --> 01:02:38,964
It's more difficult than you think.

1658
01:02:38,964 --> 01:02:40,264
If they fail again, we'll try once more.

1659
01:02:40,264 --> 01:02:41,994
- Do we both have to do it? - You have to take the plastic off.

1660
01:02:41,994 --> 01:02:43,534
Oh, we had to take the plastic off.

1661
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:46,464
(We didn't do that.)

1662
01:02:46,464 --> 01:02:48,434
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

1663
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:49,834
Shouldn't you know that?

1664
01:02:51,394 --> 01:02:53,464
- The plastic. - Ready, set, go!

1665
01:02:53,464 --> 01:02:55,034
(Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo try for the second time.)

1666
01:02:56,134 --> 01:02:57,394
You have to soak it completely.

1667
01:02:57,394 --> 01:02:59,134
We have to succeed.

1668
01:02:59,134 --> 01:03:01,164
(They try even more carefully this time.)

1669
01:03:01,164 --> 01:03:02,164
Stop!

1670
01:03:02,164 --> 01:03:03,764
- You have to take them off now. - Time's up.

1671
01:03:03,764 --> 01:03:05,894
(Will they be able...)

1672
01:03:05,894 --> 01:03:11,834
(to stop their bingo?)

1673
01:03:12,994 --> 01:03:14,264
(It's a success.)

1674
01:03:15,764 --> 01:03:18,764
(Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo did it.)

1675
01:03:18,764 --> 01:03:20,164
If we took the plastic off, we would've won.

1676
01:03:20,564 --> 01:03:21,764
(Seok Jin and Jong Kook fail to get a bingo.)

1677
01:03:21,764 --> 01:03:23,264
- Thank you. - We did it right in front of them.

1678
01:03:23,734 --> 01:03:25,134
(Nobody can make a bingo now.)

1679
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:26,794
- We could've been able to do it. - Thank you, Sir.

1680
01:03:26,834 --> 01:03:28,134
Thank you so much.

1681
01:03:28,464 --> 01:03:29,634
This is so annoying.

1682
01:03:29,634 --> 01:03:30,894
(Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo win with the most missions done.)

1683
01:03:32,394 --> 01:03:36,064
The final mission is "Find the Matching Cards".

1684
01:03:36,064 --> 01:03:38,594
If you have two matching cards,

1685
01:03:38,734 --> 01:03:40,594
discard them...

1686
01:03:40,664 --> 01:03:44,664
and take one of the cards the team on your left is holding.

1687
01:03:44,664 --> 01:03:46,534
When you discard the cards,

1688
01:03:46,564 --> 01:03:48,464
you have to do the action written on the cards...

1689
01:03:48,464 --> 01:03:50,064
to prove you discarded them.

1690
01:03:50,064 --> 01:03:52,394
The team to discard all cards will avoid the penalty.

1691
01:03:52,394 --> 01:03:55,034
The team holding the penalty card at the very last moment...

1692
01:03:55,034 --> 01:03:56,164
will receive the penalty.

1693
01:03:56,164 --> 01:03:59,264
Kwang Soo will get the Exchange Card item.

1694
01:03:59,264 --> 01:04:00,964
(The final race gets started.)

1695
01:04:03,264 --> 01:04:05,094
- Let's begin. - Do we draw one now?

1696
01:04:05,194 --> 01:04:06,234
Kwang Soo's team goes first.

1697
01:04:06,364 --> 01:04:07,864
Do you want me to draw first?

1698
01:04:07,894 --> 01:04:08,934
Do it.

1699
01:04:09,034 --> 01:04:10,334
I will...

1700
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:14,434
take the second one from the right.

1701
01:04:14,464 --> 01:04:15,634
- This one? - Yes.

1702
01:04:18,694 --> 01:04:19,864
(Which card did the unlucky Kwang Soo draw?)

1703
01:04:19,864 --> 01:04:21,764
Can we discard them right after we draw their cards?

1704
01:04:21,764 --> 01:04:23,534
Yes.

1705
01:04:23,664 --> 01:04:27,364
(They got the Charm Card.)

1706
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:30,734
We'll... Let's see. Then this one should...

1707
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:32,334
This one should...

1708
01:04:32,334 --> 01:04:34,064
Do we have to use them?

1709
01:04:34,994 --> 01:04:36,434
You should know this.

1710
01:04:36,494 --> 01:04:37,834
You should know this.

1711
01:04:38,264 --> 01:04:41,434
Throwing cards away can be rather disadvantageous sometimes.

1712
01:04:41,434 --> 01:04:43,164
Because you can be a target.

1713
01:04:43,164 --> 01:04:44,294
You shouldn't have told them.

1714
01:04:44,734 --> 01:04:46,794
I was foolish.

1715
01:04:47,534 --> 01:04:49,164
- We don't have to throw them away. - We don't have to?

1716
01:04:49,364 --> 01:04:50,694
You don't have to.

1717
01:04:50,694 --> 01:04:52,434
- Okay. - You don't need to.

1718
01:04:52,934 --> 01:04:54,964
Is it our turn?

1719
01:04:54,964 --> 01:04:56,094
You should choose one now.

1720
01:04:56,664 --> 01:04:59,534
It's from 1 to 5.

1721
01:04:59,534 --> 01:05:01,134
(It's Jae Seok and Jung Seok's turn to choose.)

1722
01:05:01,634 --> 01:05:06,634
(Will they be able to avoid the Penalty Card?)

1723
01:05:06,634 --> 01:05:07,734
(Jung Seok already has a Penalty Card.)

1724
01:05:07,734 --> 01:05:08,864
- I'll designate one. - Go ahead.

1725
01:05:08,864 --> 01:05:11,134
- I know you're nervous. - It's 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

1726
01:05:11,234 --> 01:05:13,494
It's 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

1727
01:05:13,494 --> 01:05:15,394
(What will he choose?)

1728
01:05:15,394 --> 01:05:17,164
I'll pick the third one.

1729
01:05:17,164 --> 01:05:18,764
- This one? - The one in the middle.

1730
01:05:18,764 --> 01:05:21,594
- He looks disappointed. - Wait a moment.

1731
01:05:21,664 --> 01:05:23,334
Wait a moment.

1732
01:05:24,994 --> 01:05:27,634
(Good. Think again, Jung Seok.)

1733
01:05:29,294 --> 01:05:30,764
- Give it to me. I'll take it. - Give it to him.

1734
01:05:30,764 --> 01:05:33,064
Give it to him.

1735
01:05:33,064 --> 01:05:35,334
- Give him the one in the middle. - Give it to him.

1736
01:05:35,334 --> 01:05:39,034
Jung Seok completely conned them.

1737
01:05:39,994 --> 01:05:42,234
- What should they do? - You can see ours now.

1738
01:05:43,034 --> 01:05:44,764
(Let's throw ours away.)

1739
01:05:44,764 --> 01:05:45,864
We will...

1740
01:05:45,864 --> 01:05:48,734
(They can throw away two Kiss on the Cheek Cards.)

1741
01:05:48,734 --> 01:05:50,664
(They pretend to kiss each other.)

1742
01:05:50,664 --> 01:05:52,234
We will throw them away.

1743
01:05:53,834 --> 01:05:54,894
(They threw them away.)

1744
01:05:54,894 --> 01:05:56,234
- Okay. - Oh my.

1745
01:05:56,764 --> 01:05:58,394
Then let's shuffle them.

1746
01:05:58,764 --> 01:06:00,534
I can't tell because they're upside down.

1747
01:06:00,534 --> 01:06:02,994
- Gosh. - You hold them.

1748
01:06:02,994 --> 01:06:05,294
- I don't want to choose something. - I understand.

1749
01:06:05,694 --> 01:06:07,694
(Where is the Penalty Card?)

1750
01:06:07,694 --> 01:06:10,794
- Pick one. - Everyone is disguising very well.

1751
01:06:10,794 --> 01:06:13,764
- There are two bombs among them. - He may pick a Penalty Card.

1752
01:06:13,794 --> 01:06:14,934
We don't know it, either.

1753
01:06:14,934 --> 01:06:16,894
You may have to have two Penalty Cards.

1754
01:06:17,034 --> 01:06:18,964
- All look like Penalty Cards. - I don't want to choose one.

1755
01:06:18,964 --> 01:06:20,894
- I understand. - Let's go with the middle one.

1756
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:22,634
(The card in the middle?)

1757
01:06:22,634 --> 01:06:24,234
- Okay. - He hides them well.

1758
01:06:24,234 --> 01:06:25,994
It was easy for you to see.

1759
01:06:25,994 --> 01:06:27,334
I'll let you know.

1760
01:06:28,894 --> 01:06:30,264
Pass it to me. I'll look at it.

1761
01:06:30,264 --> 01:06:31,434
(Let's see.)

1762
01:06:31,434 --> 01:06:33,394
(We can't tell from Jung Seok's face.)

1763
01:06:34,264 --> 01:06:36,164
(The card Seok Jin and Jong Kook brought is...)

1764
01:06:36,164 --> 01:06:37,664
Please let me see.

1765
01:06:37,664 --> 01:06:38,794
(The card Seok Jin and Jong Kook brought is...)

1766
01:06:38,794 --> 01:06:39,894
This is insane.

1767
01:06:39,894 --> 01:06:42,994
(It's a Penalty Card.)

1768
01:06:42,994 --> 01:06:44,864
(It is a Penalty Card.)

1769
01:06:44,864 --> 01:06:45,994
Oh my.

1770
01:06:45,994 --> 01:06:47,664
(It is a Penalty Card.)

1771
01:06:47,664 --> 01:06:49,364
(They want to laugh out loud.)

1772
01:06:49,364 --> 01:06:51,564
(Show Your Individual Skills Card and Tour around Daegu Card)

1773
01:06:51,564 --> 01:06:55,064
We're heading toward the end.

1774
01:06:55,064 --> 01:06:57,064
They were Forehead Kiss Cards.

1775
01:06:57,464 --> 01:06:59,164
- I'll use the Exchange Card. - Okay.

1776
01:06:59,464 --> 01:07:00,664
Give it to me.

1777
01:07:00,664 --> 01:07:02,934
- Suit yourself. - I like the exchange.

1778
01:07:03,634 --> 01:07:06,534
We're almost heading toward the end.

1779
01:07:06,534 --> 01:07:09,294
- It's almost the end. - Does it end if you have two bombs?

1780
01:07:09,694 --> 01:07:11,334
Among 1, 2 and 3.

1781
01:07:12,164 --> 01:07:13,434
Pick one.

1782
01:07:13,434 --> 01:07:15,064
(Haha and Ji Hyo have to choose one.)

1783
01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:16,134
I'll choose number three.

1784
01:07:17,034 --> 01:07:18,094
Here.

1785
01:07:18,094 --> 01:07:19,194
Take a look.

1786
01:07:19,194 --> 01:07:22,194
(Haha and Ji Hyo only had a Penalty Card.)

1787
01:07:22,194 --> 01:07:23,934
(What did they choose?)

1788
01:07:23,934 --> 01:07:25,734
Good job, Haha.

1789
01:07:26,764 --> 01:07:28,134
Did you see that? You can do it, too.

1790
01:07:28,134 --> 01:07:30,294
You haven't tried that yet.

1791
01:07:30,494 --> 01:07:32,464
Right?

1792
01:07:32,464 --> 01:07:35,464
You look desperate.

1793
01:07:35,934 --> 01:07:38,334
I thought it would be over soon.

1794
01:07:38,964 --> 01:07:43,134
If you have two matching cards, you can throw them away and end it.

1795
01:07:43,134 --> 01:07:45,694
(Will it be a Penalty Card or the same card?)

1796
01:07:45,734 --> 01:07:48,194
- But it can be a Penalty Card. - Right.

1797
01:07:48,964 --> 01:07:52,634
(Haha and Ji Hyo actually have two Penalty Cards.)

1798
01:07:55,794 --> 01:07:57,834
(They're anticipating.)

1799
01:07:58,664 --> 01:08:00,334
Look at Kwang Soo's expression.

1800
01:08:00,994 --> 01:08:03,664
(They got the Penalty Card again.)

1801
01:08:03,664 --> 01:08:05,064
It must be a Penalty Card.

1802
01:08:05,064 --> 01:08:06,194
(It must be a Penalty Card.)

1803
01:08:06,194 --> 01:08:07,264
(Your misery is our joy.)

1804
01:08:07,264 --> 01:08:09,134
His expression changed suddenly.

1805
01:08:09,134 --> 01:08:10,794
- I'll shuffle them. - I saw your expression.

1806
01:08:11,234 --> 01:08:12,664
We're in trouble now.

1807
01:08:12,664 --> 01:08:13,994
(Jung Seok might pick the Penalty Card.)

1808
01:08:13,994 --> 01:08:15,564
They need to throw the cards away.

1809
01:08:15,564 --> 01:08:17,904
The upper one is 1 and the lower one is 2.

1810
01:08:17,904 --> 01:08:19,464
- That's right. - Jung Seok, pick one.

1811
01:08:19,694 --> 01:08:22,264
- One or two. - I'm so unlucky. You saw me, right?

1812
01:08:22,694 --> 01:08:25,164
- I can see your cards. - Take what you want.

1813
01:08:25,794 --> 01:08:27,034
- One or two. - Should I pick one again?

1814
01:08:27,034 --> 01:08:28,294
- Do it. - I feel anxious.

1815
01:08:28,294 --> 01:08:29,734
- Suddenly, I feel anxious. - One or two.

1816
01:08:29,734 --> 01:08:30,834
(It's a 50 percent chance.)

1817
01:08:30,834 --> 01:08:32,364
I feel so worried.

1818
01:08:32,864 --> 01:08:34,734
Your nails are so pretty.

1819
01:08:34,734 --> 01:08:36,964
(What's Jung Seok's choice?)

1820
01:08:36,964 --> 01:08:40,064
(What is the last card Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo has?)

1821
01:08:40,064 --> 01:08:43,034
Look at Kwang Soo. I can read your mind.

1822
01:08:43,964 --> 01:08:45,264
(They glance at it.)

1823
01:08:45,264 --> 01:08:48,164
Look at Kwang Soo. I can read your mind.

1824
01:08:48,264 --> 01:08:49,994
(It's the Penalty Card.)

1825
01:08:50,694 --> 01:08:53,094
(How unfortunate.)

1826
01:08:53,094 --> 01:08:55,164
- This is 1 and this is 2. - Did you see it?

1827
01:08:55,294 --> 01:08:56,294
One and two.

1828
01:08:56,294 --> 01:08:59,294
(The Penalty Cards go around and around.)

1829
01:08:59,294 --> 01:09:01,564
They're 1 and 2.

1830
01:09:01,794 --> 01:09:03,164
- We'll take the upper one. - The upper one?

1831
01:09:03,164 --> 01:09:04,864
- Yes. - Let's see.

1832
01:09:05,764 --> 01:09:06,904
Okay.

1833
01:09:06,904 --> 01:09:09,904
(In whose hand is the Penalty Card?)

1834
01:09:09,904 --> 01:09:12,464
(He takes a deep breath.)

1835
01:09:12,464 --> 01:09:16,864
(What Jong Kook picked is the tenacious Penalty Card.)

1836
01:09:16,864 --> 01:09:19,434
(He got the Penalty Card.)

1837
01:09:19,434 --> 01:09:21,034
You can choose the card this time.

1838
01:09:22,734 --> 01:09:24,634
Why? Did you tolerate a lot?

1839
01:09:24,634 --> 01:09:26,334
"What should I do?"

1840
01:09:26,834 --> 01:09:28,904
- I get to think a lot. - What should I do with him?

1841
01:09:29,334 --> 01:09:31,904
- What should I do? - What should I do?

1842
01:09:31,904 --> 01:09:33,934
- What should I do with him? - Look.

1843
01:09:33,934 --> 01:09:35,964
- It's 1, 2 and 3. - Okay.

1844
01:09:37,564 --> 01:09:39,434
- This one? - Number one.

1845
01:09:40,464 --> 01:09:42,664
Let's not look.

1846
01:09:42,994 --> 01:09:45,034
- I won't see it. - I won't, either.

1847
01:09:45,034 --> 01:09:47,234
- Let's leave them as they are. - There must be something important.

1848
01:09:47,294 --> 01:09:49,164
There must be something important.

1849
01:09:49,164 --> 01:09:51,404
If I win, let's choose that one. And if you win, pick this one.

1850
01:09:51,404 --> 01:09:53,634
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1851
01:09:53,664 --> 01:09:54,764
- The left one, please. - This one?

1852
01:09:54,764 --> 01:09:57,364
- I didn't see it. - Me neither.

1853
01:09:57,364 --> 01:09:58,494
(The Penalty Card can make it back to square one.)

1854
01:09:58,494 --> 01:10:00,664
- Look at that. - Is this the end?

1855
01:10:00,664 --> 01:10:06,064
(Will the fortune be on Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo's side?)

1856
01:10:12,594 --> 01:10:13,964
Yes.

1857
01:10:14,164 --> 01:10:15,464
(He screams.)

1858
01:10:17,464 --> 01:10:20,064
(Show Your Individual Skills Card finally meets its pair.)

1859
01:10:20,064 --> 01:10:21,994
Did you find the pair?

1860
01:10:21,994 --> 01:10:23,864
- They must be a pair. - They seem so.

1861
01:10:25,694 --> 01:10:26,834
This is incredible.

1862
01:10:27,134 --> 01:10:29,494
(They're the first ones to escape the penalty.)

1863
01:10:29,494 --> 01:10:31,134
In 1, 2, 3, 4.

1864
01:10:31,134 --> 01:10:33,404
A huge mosquito bit me at night

1865
01:10:33,534 --> 01:10:37,194
It was itchy so I scratched a lot

(Kwang Soo and Kyung Soo placed the first.)

1869

- Congratulations. - Thank you.

1874
01:10:52,734 --> 01:10:53,764
You're finished consecutively.

We're finished, too.

1876

It's over. We're done.

1879

- You should take this. - Yes.

1880
01:11:02,234 --> 01:11:04,094
If you take this, it's over.

1881
01:11:04,094 --> 01:11:05,664
- If you take this. - They finish consecutively.

1882

It's over.

1883
01:11:06,764 --> 01:11:08,564
(They pass the Penalty Card to Haha and Ji Hyo.)

1884
01:11:08,564 --> 01:11:10,664
We should have done that before.

1885

- Kyung Soo's Exchange Card was... - That was awesome.

- He did very well. - We made it.

1887

We were unlucky until the end.

1888
01:11:17,734 --> 01:11:18,794
I'm relieved.

1889
01:11:18,794 --> 01:11:20,264
We had ox blood soup together before.

1890
01:11:20,264 --> 01:11:22,264
I feel bad for them.

1891
01:11:23,494 --> 01:11:24,764
They pay for it straight away.

1892

1894
01:11:28,164 --> 01:11:31,334
- Since he owns... - Since he owns a store...

1895
01:11:31,334 --> 01:11:33,134
(He's used to that device.)

1896

(The total is 446 dollars.)

1897

(Twice will be here next week.)

1902
01:11:46,934 --> 01:11:51,534
(Every member of the group is pretty.)

1903
01:11:51,534 --> 01:11:52,964
(It's Twice.)

1904
01:11:52,964 --> 01:11:53,964
I'm just happy.

1905
01:11:53,964 --> 01:11:55,834
(They're cute, little girls.)

1906
