1
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,610
Well played, Captain.

2
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,850
Well done, brother.

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,130
Congratulations.

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,010
Bravo, bravo.

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,930
Nice one, old man.

6
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,290
A gentleman and a player.

7
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,880
Hear, hear.

8
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,650
Are you all right, Vince?

9
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,160
You done the old man proud.

10
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,890
Shall I say a prayer?

11
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,810
Nice try, Brown,
but as a devout atheist, I think

12
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,490
my brother would prefer to be
remembered

13
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,610
~ with this.
~ Oh, yes.

14
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,490
Chateau Laponte.

15
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,970
One of his last two bottles.
It seemed a fitting occasion.

16
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,360
Indeed.

17
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,570
Wish me luck?

18
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,930
He'd be turning in his grave if he
could see the state of the team.

19
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,090
No captain. Chairman AWOL.

20
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,010
Monty's in the Commonwealth
with Her Majesty.

21
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,770
I did some wicket keeping
in my seminary days.

22
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,170
Perhaps you could
step in for your husband.

23
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,490
Whip them all into shape.

24
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,690
~ She's a woman!
~ Commendable powers
of observation, Major.

25
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,650
Women don't know
anything about cricket.

26
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,810
Actually, I'm not completely
clueless.

27
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,650
Hear, hear. That's settled, then.

28
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,890
You're in charge.

29
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,610
Bloody lunacy.

30
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,820
Howzat?!

31
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,890
I've just been admiring the ground.

32
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,530
Although I'm curious,
Professor Milton, as to why it says

33
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,610
Hambleston CC above the pavilion?

34
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,170
These acres were once
the site of a boundary

35
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,730
dispute between Lord Hambleston
and the Earl of Montague.

36
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,650
Generations of infighting.

37
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,890
It all got frightfully tedious so
they reached a gentlemen's
agreement.

38
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,330
An annual cricket match,

39
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,050
with the winning side claiming
ownership for the following year.

40
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,730
Over time,
it became this ground here.

41
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,370
It's our local derby.
Fiercely fought.

42
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,420
And a week tomorrow.

43
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,210
All prepared, milady?

44
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,360
I'm afraid you have me
at a disadvantage.

45
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,850
Max Scullion. Your new neighbour.

46
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,290
Oh, of course.

47
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,050
Geordie Hambleston's yet another
victim of Mr Atlee's death duties.

48
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,250
Mr Scullion is the new
owner of the estate.

49
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,090
You must dine with me next week.

50
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,930
It would be my pleasure.

51
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,290
Welcome to Kembleford.

52
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,610
Thank you. Although we are
technically on Hambleston soil.

53
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,250
Nine years in a row to be exact.

54
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,770
Are you a cricketer?

55
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,890
Don't know one end of a bat from
the other but I like a challenge,

56
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,810
and my team's coming
together nicely.

57
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,680
Which is more than can be
said for yours.

58
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,410
Is this it?

59
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,930
Fred Pebble's out with a gammy leg.

60
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,450
Vince Lennon?

61
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,210
Said he'd be along.

62
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,970
If he's got time.

63
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,690
Which means we're only eight men.

64
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,250
Um... If you're looking for
volunteers,

65
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,900
I'm told I was quite a handy
leg break in my youth.

66
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,690
Thank you, Father.

67
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,340
It seems we face an uphill task.

68
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,930
Forgive the intrusion.
Raj Chandraty.

69
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,570
Dr Fairfax's locum.

70
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,690
Oh, of course.

71
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,330
Mrs McCarthy informs me
you are looking for players.

72
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,490
Your arrival couldn't be
more timely.

73
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,250
No, no. Wait just a minute.

74
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,370
Shouldn't we be discussing amongst
ourselves whether he's suitable?

75
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,610
I assume you wouldn't be here
if not a player.

76
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,010
I was an amateur
for the Jaipur Maharajas.

77
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,610
Before that, captain of
the University of Calcutta XI.

78
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,130
And we short a captain.
How very propitious.

79
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,730
Steady on. Surely there's someone
more officer material.

80
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,180
Well, like this fellow here?

81
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,050
I second Lady Felicia's proposal.

82
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,810
Welcome on board, Doctor.

83
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,690
Hear, hear! Welcome.

84
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,540
I've a feeling we'll be needing you.

85
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,210
This is Major Peter Wallander.
Club Secretary.

86
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,930
How do you do?

87
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,490
You're late. The meeting's over.

88
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,410
Then, do you need any odd jobs doing?

89
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,490
You're sacked.

90
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,530
And if I catch you
sniffing round my house again,

91
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,570
I'll knock you to hell and back.

92
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,090
I think you have an audience.

93
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,060
Morning.

94
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,930
This is Vince Lennon.

95
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:09,370
Demon fast bowler and our best
hope of victory against Hambleston.

96
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,570
Vince. This is your new captain.

97
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,090
They made the punka wallah
team captain?

98
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,410
Bet that went down well
with Major Blimp.

99
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,570
Watch your mouth, Lennon, unless you
want to find yourself in more
trouble.

100
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,820
No offence intended.
See you around, Doc.

101
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,380
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

102
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,810
And I think three dozen
of my scones.

103
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,050
We wouldn't want to run
out like we did last year.

104
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,300
Or the year before that.

105
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,080
Holy Mother of God!

106
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,450
Amen.

107
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,450
Get this to the lab, please,
Sergeant.

108
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,970
Yes, sir.

109
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,410
I was thinking the same thing.

110
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,450
Don't tell me.

111
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,490
I can now add telepathy
to your list of abilities?

112
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,660
That's an exit wound.
The body was turned over.

113
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,010
Curiously formal, don't you think?

114
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,570
And then... they washed his face.

115
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:10,120
I think I can draw my own
conclusions, thank you.

116
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,890
Do you happen to know
who his next of kin is?

117
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,610
Jane Milton.

118
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,380
Professor Milton is
Vince Lennon's next of kin?

119
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,300
I'm afraid so.

120
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,970
He was eight.

121
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,090
An evacuee from some godforsaken
slum where he'd never known

122
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,080
anything but abuse.

123
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,090
When his family were
killed in a bombing raid, my brother

124
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,180
and I adopted him.

125
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,970
That was very altruistic.

126
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,480
Humane.

127
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,300
Vince was, well,
he was a very damaged child.

128
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,210
Filthy and malnourished.

129
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,330
Almost feral at first.

130
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,290
We thought that with enough time

131
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:08,620
and love he could become
a valuable member of society.

132
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:19,460
That nurture could triumph over
nature and love could conquer all.

133
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:23,730
Your brother,
he took his own life last year.

134
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,930
Do you mind me asking why?

135
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,180
The only one that can
answer that is Charles.

136
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,010
Do the police know who was
responsible?

137
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,610
Vince Lennon collected enemies
the way other people collect stamps.

138
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,890
So I expect it will be a while to
work their way through the list.

139
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,890
In the meantime, to be brutally
practical, we've lost our fast

140
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,010
bowler - I'm hoping you or the
inspector may provide a bit of pace.

141
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,290
Are you something
of an expert, Your Ladyship?

142
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,730
Oh, gosh. Hardly. Although I do have
six older brothers

143
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,810
so something may have sunk in.

144
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,090
Sorry to interrupt. I think there's
something you should see.

145
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,580
Come on.

146
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,920
I suppose it's appropriate.

147
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,410
Although Vince would hate it.

148
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,290
Do you think they'd all be shocked
if I laid him

149
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,680
to rest in a bomber jacket?

150
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:18,060
I don't think you've ever given
a jot for convention.

151
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,130
If you're investigating,
I should tell you the police already

152
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,520
searched and found nothing.

153
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,120
Maybe they were
looking in the wrong place.

154
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,040
Missal.

155
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,770
Vince hasn't attended mass
since he was 16.

156
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,970
I suppose it didn't help us
both being atheists.

157
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:48,380
But we could hardly deny him
his birth religion.

158
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:54,850
Initials, dates, amounts,
£15, £15, £25.

159
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,970
These aren't odd jobs.

160
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,010
And this.

161
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,930
Blackmail?

162
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,050
Does it say who they are?

163
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,770
Only initials.

164
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,460
OM. PW. LB.

165
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,820
The payments from OM
stop a year ago.

166
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,620
You think one of them sent this?

167
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,090
Well, someone "settled the matter"
for once and for all.

168
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,100
Did you see that specialist?

169
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,940
Yes.

170
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,740
He said I'd outlive you!

171
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,880
We have to give this to the police.

172
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,050
I suppose we must.

173
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,380
I sense a "but".

174
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:06,060
Even if one of them is the murderer,
what of the others?

175
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,200
The police will have to track them
down, poor souls.

176
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,860
All those secrets laid bare.

177
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,660
Lives ruined.

178
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,980
I see you have some new players?

179
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,850
Local men, are they?

180
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,730
Australia. Cattlemen hired to
work on my estate.

181
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,690
I'm surprised to see you at practice
under the circumstances.

182
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,570
Victory is the offspring
of preparation and opportunity.

183
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,010
The murdered boy was
a member of our team.

184
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,610
Like I said.

185
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,000
Howzat!

186
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,860
~ Howzat.
~ Thank you, Doctor.

187
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,560
May I introduce our new captain,
Raj Chandraty?

188
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:04,200
Looks like I'm not the only one with
a foreigner on his team.

189
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,330
I'll see you at dinner
tonight, milady.

190
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,450
I look forward to it.

191
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,250
He doesn't have
cattle on his estate.

192
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,330
I'm so glad you could come.

193
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,980
It beats sitting at home moping.

194
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,370
And I confess my curiosity
as to what the opposition are up to.

195
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,760
Ringers on the team indeed.

196
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,890
It seems like a lot of effort
for a village cricket match.

197
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,490
Is there a Mrs Scullion?

198
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:36,340
Three. Scattered all round
the country. Bleeding me dry.

199
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,890
You been married long?

200
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,410
Two years.

201
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,730
I'd keep an eye on her
if I were you.

202
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,170
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

203
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,360
PW.

204
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,020
How's the investigation going?
Have you found the murder weapon?

205
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,170
We've only identified
the make as of yet.

206
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,860
Walther P38. The country's awash
with ruddy war souvenirs.

207
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm afraid I can't say.

208
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,330
Bit of a blow losing your
star player.

209
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,690
I'm sure our new captain will
make up the deficit.

210
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,170
May the best side win.

211
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,930
I'm surprised you're all being

212
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:24,080
so casual about your tenth defeat
in a row.

213
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,800
You don't know?

214
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,650
Know what?

215
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,970
I suggest you take a look
at the original articles of 1783.

216
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:37,490
Should either side be
victor for ten successive years,

217
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,840
they claim ownership
of the land in perpetuity.

218
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,730
~ Did you know about this?
~ No, I didn't.

219
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,890
But the ground's been shared by
both villages for centuries.

220
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,530
It's a gentlemen's agreement.

221
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,860
In that case,
I'm glad I'm not a gentleman.

222
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,850
Shall I bring my sewing basket
and join you?

223
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,100
I prefer my own company.

224
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,770
Is that why you slept
in your dressing room last night?

225
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,090
I didn't want to
intrude on your grief.

226
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:14,770
For the umpteenth time there was
nothing between me and Vince Lennon.

227
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,290
Why won't you believe me?

228
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,170
I prefer the evidence
of my own eyes.

229
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,570
Talking. You saw us talking.

230
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:24,090
It didn't look like you were
discussing the windows.

231
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,650
What exactly were you talking about?

232
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,220
His money.
He said he was five shillings short.

233
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,930
Little Bear misses Daddy Bear.

234
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,250
Good morning.

235
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,020
Good morning, Father.
I'll fetch us some tea.

236
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,660
No prizes for guessing why
you're here.

237
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,730
What(?!)

238
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,930
This is what happens when you put
a woman and a darkie in charge.

239
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,770
If Scullion thinks we are going
to take this lying down...

240
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,410
I'm here about Vince.

241
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,330
If you want me to go to the funeral
you're wasting your breath.

242
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,450
He was a blackmailer.

243
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:10,780
Doesn't surprise me.
Crooked as a dog's hind leg.

244
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,700
He identified one of his victims
by the initials PW.

245
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,490
If you think that low life
would extort money...

246
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,530
I'd have knocked him to hell
and back first.

247
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,450
So you said,
the day he was murdered.

248
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,450
I didn't kill him.
Although I wish I had.

249
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,970
He was sniffing round my wife.

250
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,370
I see.

251
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,450
How long had Vince been
blackmailing you?

252
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,570
Does my husband know?

253
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,370
No.

254
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,490
And I won't tell him.

255
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,010
Or anything else you tell me.

256
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,410
How did you find out?

257
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:08,460
He referred to one of his victims
as LB. Little Bear?

258
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,090
It's what Peter calls me.

259
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,010
At least, he used to.

260
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,960
Vince liked to mimic...

261
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:25,850
He was vile and I'm glad he's dead.
At least...

262
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,900
Your secret is safe?

263
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:39,420
"Kept woman" sounds so much better
than whore, don't you think?

264
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,260
My first husband died in the war.

265
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:55,060
And I was all but destitute when
a "gentleman" offered me a lifeline.

266
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,850
What price virtue?

267
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:04,100
Well, in my case, a flat in
Maida Vale, a quarterly allowance...

268
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,260
.. and the loss of all self respect.

269
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,730
Peter had no idea.

270
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:19,780
He rescued me. He gave me
everything I've ever wanted.

271
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:28,580
Security, respectability,
and above all - unconditional love.

272
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:35,660
In which case, if you confess,
he will be able to forgive you.

273
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,820
And the proudest and the most
stubborn.

274
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,860
He'd never be able to forgive such
deceit.

275
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,770
He'd leave me.

276
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,290
And then my heart would break.

277
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,530
Sir.

278
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,410
I just took a telephone call with
information on the Lennon murder.

279
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,010
What kind of information?

280
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,000
The anonymous kind.

281
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,490
Go on.

282
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,650
"Why don't you find
out what the good doctor was

283
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,610
"burying in his garden
on Thursday night?

284
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,730
"That's what happens when you let...
his sort..."

285
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,290
Yes, Sergeant. Thank you.

286
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,480
I think I get the gist.

287
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,770
Have you handed in that book?

288
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,820
I've just come
from the police station.

289
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,800
And you've been sleuthing,
so spill the beans.

290
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,970
Is PW Peter Wallander?

291
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,160
No.

292
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,240
But you've found out something.

293
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,570
I think the initials refer to
nicknames.

294
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:10,330
Vince was fond of his nicknames.
The crueller the better, usually.

295
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,700
Yes.

296
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,220
So, if PW isn't Peter Wallander...?

297
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,570
I think I can make
an educated guess.

298
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,370
If you think I killed him,
you are mistaken.

299
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,930
I'm a physician.
I took an oath to save lives.

300
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,650
Not take them.

301
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,170
You still haven't
answered my question.

302
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,160
With respect,
that's a private matter.

303
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,810
Well, if the police make
the same deduction,

304
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,800
it will no longer be
a private matter.

305
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,490
For another's sake,
I can only pray that won't happen.

306
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,680
An affair of the heart?

307
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,480
You mistake me for a man of honour.

308
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,520
Yet I breached the sacred
bonds of marriage.

309
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:07,740
I disgraced myself
and betrayed my gods.

310
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,650
I said search, not destroy,
Sergeant.

311
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,410
Am I allowed to ask what you're
looking for?

312
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,730
I can't say. I'm sorry.

313
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,540
Sir.

314
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,800
I have never seen
that before in my life.

315
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,330
So, I followed them back into town.

316
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,450
Back, as in back to the Red Lion?

317
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,970
Guilty as charged, Mrs M.

318
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:19,050
There you are, Father. There's been
a development. Carry on, Sid.

319
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,490
Turns out they're surveyors
for the Ministry of Transport.

320
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,930
Scullion is selling off his land
for a dual carriageway.

321
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,970
The blaggard!

322
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:32,050
The only spanner in the works is the
five acres of land he doesn't own.

323
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,450
Yet.

324
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,440
The cricket ground.

325
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,770
He has got an absolute fortune
riding on that match tomorrow.

326
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:43,620
And with Vince gone our only hope
is the good doctor.

327
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,130
Vince Lennon was a blackmailer.

328
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,730
We believe he was lured
to his death by one of his victims.

329
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,060
I have to ask, was
he blackmailing you?

330
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,090
Yes.

331
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,890
Why?

332
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,010
I give you my word it isn't
relevant.

333
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:05,220
This is a murder investigation.
I'll need more than that.

334
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,090
It involves a third party.

335
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,340
Then, do you have an
alibi for the night of the murder?

336
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,970
No.

337
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,290
~ Not now.
~ From Father Brown, sir.

338
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,610
You may want to see this.

339
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,610
I'm halting
the interview for a tea break.

340
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,050
White, no sugar,
and one for the prisoner.

341
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,570
Yes, sir.

342
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,770
Can I speak to you off the record?

343
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,490
It seems Max Scullion has a deal
worth a fortune

344
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,450
resting on that match tomorrow.

345
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,410
Which makes the discovery of the gun

346
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:55,490
and the arrest of the opposition
captain very timely.

347
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,530
You think this was Scullion's work?

348
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,850
I'd stake my job on it.

349
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,570
But until we get the ballistics
back on that gun

350
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,770
and unless you can give me
an alibi for the night in question,

351
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:10,100
I'll have no choice
but to place you under arrest.

352
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,770
An Indian and a white woman.

353
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,450
One whiff of association
and she would lose everything.

354
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,850
Husband, home, children.

355
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,700
She'll be cast out, a social pariah.

356
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,020
I have disgraced her enough already.

357
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,770
'So, let's get this right.'

358
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:33,010
If we lose this match,
he builds a ruddy great road right

359
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,970
through the middle
of our cricket ground?

360
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,810
My lawyer says that though ancient,
the clause is watertight

361
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,330
and binding.

362
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,450
Then we're doomed.

363
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:46,170
Nine men, star player murdered,
captain banged up in a prison cell.

364
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:50,020
No-one blames you, Inspector.
This is Scullion's work.

365
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,130
I do.

366
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:55,930
Right, Sid's opening the bowling.
Sergeant Goodfellow in square leg.

367
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:59,330
Bill, I've put you in first slip.
Not too much running.

368
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,090
Inspector. Wicket keeper.

369
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,090
I'll be requiring you to
step up as captain.

370
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,210
It would be an honour.

371
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:10,410
Father Brown is as well out of
harm's way as possible.

372
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,090
And I've put Monty on the list

373
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,540
because he's here in spirit.

374
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,850
A penny for your thoughts?

375
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:24,260
They're hardly edifying.
I'm wishing I believed in hell.

376
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:31,050
If only so Max Scullion can
burn in a pit of boiling oil or

377
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:35,010
roasting on a spit
surrounded by pitchforked demons.

378
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,330
How wonderfully medieval.

379
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,290
I expect you'd prefer to redeem him.

380
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,650
Can you hold up?

381
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,500
I think I've got a stone in my shoe.

382
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,700
Always.
Hell is merely the absence of God.

383
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,650
I wouldn't wish
it on my own worst enemy.

384
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,800
I'm glad Charles isn't
here to see all this.

385
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,810
He loved that ground.

386
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,650
It would break his heart.

387
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,440
Now what are you doing?

388
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,250
That's Vince's scarf.

389
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,410
Good luck, chaps. May the best
team win. Play.

390
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:27,250
Where is Father Brown? We can't
afford to lose another player.

391
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,600
Maybe he was called away to
a parish emergency?

392
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,170
~ Should we send someone
to look for him?
~ No!

How?

416
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,740
We've got 196 runs to make

Thank you, Constable.

421
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,140
I'll explain on the way.

422
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:15,010
Afternoon.
I see you've lost another captain.

423
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:19,140
Thanks to you. We all know who
planted that gun.

424
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:24,650
That's quite an accusation.
I trust you have a good lawyer.

425
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,490
God will be our judge.

426
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,490
The evil will
fall down before the good,

427
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,050
and the wicked before the gates
of the just.

428
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:36,090
You forget,
we have the Lord on our side.

429
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,340
Hah.

430
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,290
Catch it!

431
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,410
Well caught. Well bowled.

432
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,490
Bad luck, old man.

433
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,780
In all honesty,
I can't say well played.

434
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,810
But you did your level best.

435
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,740
Thank you.

436
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,820
I think.

437
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,740
Not so glum.

438
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:38,450
There's still hope the inspector
will spring our captain from jail.

439
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,490
Finding the real murder weapon was
nothing short of a miracle.

440
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,010
You don't believe in miracles.

441
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:50,100
Oh, the old stone in the shoe trick?

442
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,890
With our last hope of winning
the match languishing in jail

443
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,500
on a trumped-up murder charge,
I didn't have time to be subtle.

444
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:04,740
Why didn't you tell me
Vince was blackmailing Charles?

445
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,580
Ah. You know that.

446
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:13,380
"Old Man". Vince's nickname for him.

447
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,620
And the payments from OM stopped
shortly before he died.

448
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,250
I hoped it wouldn't come out.

449
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,090
Charles was a very private person

450
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:31,440
whose only secret was that he
loved other men.

451
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,850
He knew Vince would never let
him go.

452
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,800
And anyone he associated
with would be at risk.

453
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:44,940
Faced with living his life as a lie
- he chose death.

454
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,810
It was all
so tragically unnecessary.

455
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,040
Is that why you murdered Vince?

456
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:00,250
That is categorically not why
I murdered him.

457
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,450
That's our last man gone.

458
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,130
Bad luck, Goodfellow.

459
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,620
It seems like you're out of players.

460
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,380
Not quite, Mr Scullion.

461
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,690
That's something, at least.

462
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,010
Don't change the subject.

463
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:36,610
I forgave Vince for
Charles' suicide.

464
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,770
For the first time
he seemed genuinely

465
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,170
repentant for the effects
of his actions.

466
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,300
Shot!

467
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,490
And I confess to
an element of pride.

468
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:03,570
I wanted to believe he was sorry
because it...

469
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,720
well, it would have meant we hadn't
failed.

470
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:12,690
And we both know what follows pride.

471
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,740
He was back up to his old tricks
in weeks.

472
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,090
I saw the fear in their eyes.

473
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,170
The way people
crossed the street to avoid him.

474
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,220
You could have reported him to
the police.

475
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:31,300
Vince didn't fear the law,
man or God's.

476
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:39,260
So. You wrote the note that
lured him to the pavilion.

477
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,170
Then you killed your son.

478
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,980
As your God sacrificed his...

479
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,040
.. so that others may live.

480
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,170
And you laid out his body.

481
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:04,500
I couldn't leave him like that.
He hated sleeping on his front.

482
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:11,180
Always on his back,
arms by his side, ramrod straight.

483
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,940
That was very foolhardy.

484
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:26,740
The Grim Reaper will get me
before the long arm of the law.

485
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,290
Dodgy ticker.

486
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,970
Weeks at best,
if I took their wretched pills

487
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:38,820
and of course I stopped
when I decided to kill Vince.

488
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,570
I'm already on borrowed time.

489
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:49,290
Run, Major, run, run, run, run...

490
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,780
Oh, God.

491
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,610
~ Unlucky, Major.
~ Well played, Major.

492
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,060
Unlucky.

493
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,680
It looks like it's
down to you, Captain.

494
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,090
♪ West Indies was feeling homely

495
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,850

504
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,520
Why didn't you tell me?

505
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:51,770
I didn't want to spend our final
days with you trying to

506
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,490
save my soul.

507
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,920
Oh, well done, Captain!

508
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,160
Bit wobbly.

509
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:08,260
Don't even think about calling
the doctor.

510
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,410
It's for the best.

511
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,920
My only fear was
dying in a prison cell.

512
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,860
I know you can't endorse what I did.

513
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:36,340
But as my most valued friend,
I hope you can understand.

514
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:44,700
Vince was a rotten apple who would
have contaminated a whole barrel.

515
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,970
Wreaking evil. And destroying lives.

516
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:53,120
I acted for the most
unselfish of reasons...

517
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,090
.. because he was my child...

518
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,040
.. and I loved him.

519
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,650
Good hit!

520
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:17,260
Three balls left.
Six runs to win. I hope you're...

521
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,410
Jolly good, Mrs M.

522
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,400
No!

523
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,690
Oh, ow!

524
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,210
Boys, boys, get the stretcher.

525
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:43,660
Oh, God. Quickly.

526
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,730
That's that, then.

527
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:55,520
I don't want you getting
all maudlin on me.

528
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,690
My affairs are in order.

529
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,690
I've lodged a full confession
with my solicitor to be

530
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:05,410
handed to the police on my death.

531
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:09,490
And I've left you my last
bottle of Laponte.

532
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,250
Oh.

533
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:16,940
Not for sharing, mind. I trust you
to find the appropriate occasion.

534
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:24,500
I'm rather more concerned with your
spiritual than your earthly affairs.

535
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,210
It's a bit late for that.

536
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,480
Everyone is redeemable.

537
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:34,090
~ Even me?
~ Especially you.

538
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:41,740
And until your last breath it is not
too late... to let him in.

539
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,980
Please tell me this isn't a last
ditch attempt at conversion.

540
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:53,210
Can't blame a chap for trying.

541
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,020
All right, Doctor...

542
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:16,090
Well, the match is won, milady.

543
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:20,010
There are two balls left
and six runs to win the match.

544
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:23,050
And you are out of players.
You only had ten men.

545
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,010
Victory is mine.

546
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:29,050
You are premature, Mr Scullion.
We have a last man.

547
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,050
I don't see him.

548
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,170
You're looking at her.

549
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,170
Do you even know how to play
cricket?

550
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,890
Six brothers, Mrs M.

551
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:41,210
I spent every summer of my childhood
being used for bowling practice.

552
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,770
Shoes?

553
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,760
I've no intention of running
anywhere.

554
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:39,890
For the first time in my life I'm
experiencing a frisson

555
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:44,500
of doubt in the irrationality
of believing in a higher being.

556
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,700
I've known more stubborn atheists
fall at the final hurdle.

557
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:56,860
Not that I'd tell you. I wouldn't
give you the satisfaction.

558
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,210
Naturally.

559
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:04,580
Although, if that is the case,
I must warn you we will meet again.

560
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:12,860
Now there's a final thought to
hang on to.

561
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,050
You'd be bloody insufferable.

562
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:42,540
My heart is poured out like water.
My bones are scattered.

563
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:50,540
And my heart, like wax, is melted.

564
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,740
~ Pub, lads?
~ Yes!

565
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,530
Shall I get Father Brown
and the professor?

566
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,680
They'll be along in their own
good time.

567
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:08,330
There's something
I have to tell you, Peter.

568
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:13,010
Yes, I know. And if you have a
modicum of respect, you'll spare me

569
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,650
the gory details.

570
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,780
I wasn't unfaithful. I couldn't be.

571
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:23,730
You're the best, the most wonderful
thing that's ever happened to me.

572
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:26,570
And if you think I'd sully that
with anyone, let alone

573
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,130
the likes of Vince Lennon.

574
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,120
I saw you together.

575
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,880
He was blackmailing me.

576
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,720
Our marriage is based on a lie.

577
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,090
When we met,

578
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:43,130
you assumed
I was a respectable woman

579
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:45,940
and I'm not who you think I am.

580
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:50,250
We met in the bar
of the King George.

581
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:54,250
I was never under any illusion
that you... had a past.

582
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,330
Then why?

583
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:59,330
Even from the start you always
treated me like a lady.

584
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,050
Because you were.

585
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,340
And are... a lady.

586
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,890
And about bloody time.

587
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,740
Peter. Language.

588
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:30,410
My final duty as Captain is to make
the "Man of The Match"

589
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,290
award to Lady Felicia.

590
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:35,640
Oh, thank you. It was a lucky shot.
Thank you.

591
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,970
I hear you're leaving us.

592
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:46,410
Yes, for a position in Wales.
It's for the best.

593
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:50,300
Goodbye, Doctor. You, sir,
are a gentleman and a player.

594
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:56,410
Now, there is a celebration tea
laid on in the pavilion.

595
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:59,490
So, if the man of the match
would like to lead the way.

596
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:02,010
I'd be honoured, Mrs McCarthy.

597
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,930
You coming in, Father?

598
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,530
Soon.

599
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:14,860
First, I have an appointment
with a rather fine Laponte.
