1
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,000
So talk to me then. 
What does it say?

2
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:27,520
You talk about the back of beyond. We could be absolutely
anywhere by now. Well, it's not my fault, is it?

3
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,720
Give us it here, a sec. Think I
could've picked a more rubbish navigator?

4
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,280
What was that last place we
went through, Lower Squiddlyswick

5
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,560
or something. And that's
got to be an hour ago.

6
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,600
Oh, God knows. I'm
getting such a headache.

7
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:05,000
If it's all the same with you, I'm just going to
get out and ask. What do you mean "ask"? Ask who?

8
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,880
I don't know, whoever lives in that
house, there. Try my luck, at least.

9
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,080
What are you talking about? What house?

10
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,760
Have you...?

11
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,680
..got the handbrake
on or did we just...?

12
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,440
There was a house!

13
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,040
Like...a funny little cottage!

14
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,920
Oh, great. So now I'm seeing things.

15
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,440
Stay right where you are.

16
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,040
SHE SHRIEKS

17
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,680
MIAOW!

18
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,480
DISTANT SHRIEKING

19
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,120
SOBBING

20
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,560
She does our daily washing...

21
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,200
I hope I'm not breaking the flow.

22
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,960
So, regarding your duties outside,
this is the main terrace area.

23
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,640
It just needs a bit of a sweep each
morning to clear away any debris.

24
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,600
Right.And a good, thorough scrub-down three
times a week with a fungicidal agent.Very good.

25
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,560
Paying special attention
to the grouting.

26
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,440
OK.The drains I would only bother
with every four days.Drains?

27
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:08,360
You've got slender arms. If there's anything nasty
growing down there, I'm sure you'll catch it early.

28
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,800
Human excrement in the mail-box.

29
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,840
Used to be a dreadful
problem, of course, years ago.

30
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,320
Intended for the previous owner, but...

31
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,400
Unfortunately he never
left a forwarding address.

32
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,960
And then at six o'clock every night, if you could
just make sure the log basket's full in the lounge.

33
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,360
It might need a couple of trips.

34
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,600
Any questions so far?No.

35
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,960
Well it's certainly quite a
full schedule then, Mrs Gantry.

36
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,760
And underneath here would be,
what, some sort of coal-hole, or...?

37
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,600
No longer used, of course, since
Mr Dore and his wife moved in.

38
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,040
Carbon footprints and all that.

39
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,080
Oh, sorry. Is it all right if I
just...? Whatever you need to do, Emily.

40
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,040
Oh, thanks.Two minutes,
I'll be out of your hair.

41
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,960
Oh, God! Sorry, I'm so sorry.

44
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,280
Thanks.

45
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,040
Otherwise I'll be out on my
ear before I've even started.

46
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,000
You'll have me down
as a right liability.

47
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,520
Nothing of the sort. Now come
on, there we go. You got them?

48
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,160
Thank you. That's lovely.

49
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,960
No problem. There we go. So, another really
late one for you then, was it, last night?

50
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,880
Beavering away out there, you were.

51
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,640
Oh, well, I'm afraid the creative
impulse rarely keeps regular hours.

52
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,240
All these plots you come up with.

53
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,120
How do you even begin...

54
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,360
to get inside the mind of a murderer?

55
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,160
Well, the trick, of course, is to fool the
reader into trusting all the wrong people.

56
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,880
And then, in the most apparently innocent and
everyday details, slowly sow the seeds of terror.

57
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,200
Do me a favour and smell that mango.

58
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,080
Beeswax.Who polishes fruit, Hugo?

59
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,560
Next thing you know she'll
be simonising the bananas.

60
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,840
One can take pride in one's kitchen a
little too... ..Mrs Gantry, are you well?

61
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,640
Oh, just a word about the new recruit. I
know it's only her second day, but, er...

62
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,920
If you could get something slightly more
appropriate organised by way of her working wardrobe?

63
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,640
Just to give my husband a
fighting chance with his deadline?

64
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,160
Leave it with me, Mrs Dore.

65
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,720
Is that a thumb-print on that mango?

66
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,240
How did I miss that?

67
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,160
That might be a better
option for tomorrow.

68
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:51,040
I should hate to see history
repeating itself.Sorry? History?

69
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,280
What are you talking about?

70
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,080
Oh, well, you see, the folly of
unrequited lust has more than once

71
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,320
brought tragedy upon this house.

72
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,600
According to the story,
in the late 1880s,

73
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,520
a young Egyptian woman
of striking beauty

74
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,880
came to work here as a housekeeper.

75
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,240
Her name was Selima al-Sharad.

76
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,040
And scarcely had she joined the
household of Dr Thadeus Northcote,

77
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,280
than she found herself attending to
his needs by night as well as day.

78
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,840
Until finally, when his passion for
her cooled, a strange demonic force

79
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:39,000
is said to have transformed her
from seductress to sorceress.

80
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,280
And she put a curse on her former
lover, predicting the exact date

81
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,560
and time of day that he would
meet a dreadful, agonising death.

82
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,200
Well, as a man of science,

83
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,000
he had little time for any
suggestion of witchcraft,

84
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,400
and simply went about his
business in the normal way.

85
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,840
Until the appointed hour came round.

86
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,200
She afterwards claimed that
through some divine faculty

87
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,760
she'd actually seen "Death" approaching.

88
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,640
And the vision had struck
terror into her heart.

89
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,400
But the strange thing was,
no creature or living being

90
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,720
had come within 20 yards
of him when it happened.

91
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,040
Nor could any other method or
means of his murder be found.

92
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:45,960
Not a mark or injury anywhere on his body, or
any suggestion or possibility he'd taken poison.

93
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:53,000
So her act of vengeance, through
whatever supernatural agency,

94
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,440
forever went unpunished.

95
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,440
And of course,

96
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,520
this is the very room
in which she slept.

97
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,560
Some say, still sleeps.

98
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,680
If you believe in the
power of a restless spirit

99
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,040
to take control of a person's soul.

100
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,920
OK, so we come in off
the lighting change

101
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,440
with a whip-spot to find the table.

102
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,280
And bon appetit.

103
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,920
On the night, we can but
hope, you'll be smiling.

104
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,240
Are you kidding? The heat I've been taking last
seven days, we'll be lucky if it gets to air.

105
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,640
Oh, man, is my career
really in the crapper.

106
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,480
Well, you will go out on these
high-profile charity assignments to Africa.

107
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,280
You could choose your words
more carefully in future.

108
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,120
Goddamn Magic Relief!

109
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,680
They got you by the nuts every
time. Do you know how long it took

110
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,640
to get from the hotel to that Catholic
mission station in the desert? Six hours.

111
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,080
Couple of nuns come out to greet
me, what else am I going to say?

112
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,320
Anything, hopefully, but
"Jesus, I'm starving".

113
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,920
It's not your biggest lapse
in taste ever, I'll grant you,

114
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,520
but it's up there, would you say?

115
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,840
OK, go.

116
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,640
So now they've got to keep sticking
it to me with this crud every day.

117
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,680
Here we go again.

118
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,280
"Not content with flaunting his
sick humour in the famine zone,

119
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:28,840
"the egregious xenophobe was on more odious form
as we travelled to a village on the Eritrean border,

120
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,040
"where he was heard to say, 'Let's
hope we don't all get eaten alive',

121
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,120
"a reference, he later claimed,
to the high incidence of locusts.

122
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,320
"Although to this correspondent
the words were clearly more redolent

123
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,480
"of cannibals and cooking pots."

124
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,760
It's the press, Adam, it's
what they do. Get over it.

125
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,960
Oh, why is this so stiff?

126
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,760
Just bear with me a sec.

127
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,080
Anyway, where's the rest
of our cast got to today?

128
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,600
­ Hey! What's happening?

129
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,160
Is this a turn-up?

130
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,760
I've got a meeting down the road
at six, and I suddenly remembered

131
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,120
it was round here somewhere you
hold your top-secret rehearsals.

132
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,000
Of course, I didn't know the exact address.
I had to ask a woman at the bus-stop, but...

133
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,360
So how's it all going? Feel free to
acknowledge my presence. Is that...?

134
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,280
That's to stop him licking himself.

135
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,840
It's not something you want to watch.

136
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,200
Look, if you've come here looking
for a job because you're had enough

137
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,000
of waitressing, sorry, you're
out of luck. What's happened?

138
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,560
Has the bottom fallen out of the
Paranormal Problem-Solving business?

139
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,800
Who said I was looking for work? And I don't
know where you get the idea I've been waitressing.

140
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,680
The slight reddening of your
fingertips is characteristic

141
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,720
of someone who's recently
been handling hot plates.

142
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:51,200
The chafing on your knees almost
certainly the result of cleaning floors.

143
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,080
Both consistent with
nightly work in a restaurant.

144
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,840
While the absence of shopping appears to
suggest you've recently fallen on hard times.

145
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:05,280
Add to this the faint imprint of the
letters "Cavsnoit" on your forearm

146
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,880
where you've been leaning on the words
"Situations vacant" in the small ads,

147
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,400
the conclusion is a simple one.

148
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,960
Well, here's another fine mess.

149
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
She just quit.Who did?

150
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,560
Who did? Sunitri, our uniquely
gifted Bengali showgirl.

151
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:26,560
Said she couldn't in all conscience continue
to work with a barefaced, racist bigot.

152
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,280
Three hours to curtain up, Jonathan.

153
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,400
Who the hell's going to
do the Indian Basket Trick?

154
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,040
Oh, shut your row. Come
on, how hard can it be?

155
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,720
Just poke them through
and I'll get out the way.

156
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,280
Just poke them through?

157
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,120
Have you any idea of the immense
physical precision required here?

158
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,680
It takes years of training to perfect
the complex curvature of the joints.

159
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,320
Not even close. Got any more?
She'll end up like a pin cushion.

160
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:55,000
Hey, little star, you're doing great
in there! Any problems, just holler!

161
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,120
Nope. It's all easy peasy so
far, just keep them coming.

162
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,800
This is amazing. Very
last one now, on its way.

163
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm still cool in here. I reckon
you could easily get another one in.

164
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:13,680
Down, through the top. Are you serious?Just
need to squeeze my shoulders back

165
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,800
another half an inch, and
I need to suck myself in.

166
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,800
Perfect.

167
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:26,320
Oh, man! Will you look at that? Where
did you find this girl? She's a natural.

168
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,280
You're going to slay them out there,

169
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,440
big time. Come on. I'll see you
on the ice.Yeah, see you later.

170
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,960
Look, what is it?

171
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,560
That she's good, that she's young?

172
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,400
That she's every bit
as smart as you are?

173
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,280
I tell you, 27 years,

174
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,000
I've never known anyone pick
up a trick that fast.We'll see.

175
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,760
OK, what is it?

176
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,200
The old Magic Johnson not
making the net enough lately?

177
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,760
So listen, get to work! You're
on your own in town for the night.

178
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,680
I tell you, it's out there,
man, on every street corner.

179
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,720
You just got to know how to reel it in.

180
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,240
And the way you do that...

181
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,920
It's with the eyes. That's how
you communicate your intentions.

182
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,680
Check it out. See what
I'm saying with my eyes?

183
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,120
"Come to me tonight,
entrust me with your body,

184
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,400
"and I will pleasure every inch
of it, until you scream for mercy."

185
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,800
Yeah, forgive me if I don't rush
out and buy your latest manual

186
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,120
on gender politics any time soon.

187
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,280
In the same series, I think wasn't it,
as "Dot Cotton on Super-String Theory"?

188
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,520
You know I'm right, Jonathan.
On every street corner.

189
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,360
You've just got to make it happen.

190
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,360
APPLAUSE

191
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,480
So, shall I...?Whatever...go first?

192
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,080
It's funny, isn't it, how
you can spend months and years

193
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:43,680
getting to know someone and then,
still never get to know them.

194
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,400
Ha, tell me about it.

195
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,040
When I actually think,

196
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,680
all you really need to know about someone
you know in the first five minutes.

197
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,480
So you think our life
stories'll keep for another time?

198
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,160
Give us something to talk about in our old age.There's
just two things you should know about me, actually.

199
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,960
I don't do tongues in ears.

200
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,520
Always found it a bit
disgusting, for some reason.

201
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,600
And don't be alarmed

202
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,920
if I suddenly wake up screaming
in the middle of the night.

203
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,000
It's just, when I was 17,

204
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,960
I had this completely
strange thing happen to me.

205
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,840
There was this woman I was
sharing a flat with at the time...

206
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:31,120
That's another story. And the
two of us were out in the country,

207
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,600
one day, middle of nowhere,
and there was this cottage,

208
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,000
in a field,

209
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,040
that was there one minute,

210
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,960
and then -
so bizarre -

211
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,760
just completely vanished into thin air.

212
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,880
And when I went over to look around,

213
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,520
there was this horrible old man

214
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,760
slithering about on the ground.

215
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,560
Scared me half to death.

216
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,360
To say that weird stuff
keeps following me around!

217
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,160
Like one day I'm working in this
shoe shop and this guy comes in,

218
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,680
says he's looking for an assistant for
his housekeeper. And serious money, so...

219
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,080
And I get there, and it
turns out that 100 years ago,

220
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,480
there was like this really bizarre
murder, which no-one could explain.

221
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:27,120
Is that right?Sorry?Weird stuff?
Like, unexplained, impossible things.

222
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,160
Bit of luck you ran into me then really, wasn't
it?I have no idea what you're talking about.

223
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,920
Oh, you mean the only reason you wanted to come
over here tonight was because you really liked me,

224
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:41,360
as a person who you just happened to bump into at
a bus stop, just purely and totally by accident?

225
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,360
Look, I don't know

226
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
what y... Suddenly this
all feels very strange.

227
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:52,040
I think... Maybe I'd better just...

228
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,240
CYCLE BELL RINGS

229
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,760
Morning.

230
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,280
Come in.

231
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:42,480
Your post.Thank you. I don't know
if Mrs Gantry mentioned to you,

232
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,280
our neighbours round the corner are in New Zealand
for the year. They've put the place into hibernation.

233
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,160
I said we'd keep an eye
on the post for them.

234
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,200
Number 29, Ashwood House.

235
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,560
If you'd just pop along there every
few days and have a sort through.

236
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:01,160
Anything that looks vaguely
important, I'll get it forwarded.

237
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,480
What's this?

238
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:13,240
"You loathsome bitch. Do not think you can escape
your fate. In three days, you will be dead."

239
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,440
It's signed "Selima."
Wasn't she that woman...?

240
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,920
Perhaps you can explain why
it's in your handwriting?

241
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,280
What? I never wrote that. I swear
to God, someone must've just...

242
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,760
You believe me, surely?

243
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,160
All right.

244
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,840
Just go.

245
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:33,080
Good morning, good morning! How are we all this sunny
day? Utterly brill house last night, didn't you think?!

246
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,760
The only thing, I've had an idea how we can
make it look better when I go up the rope.

247
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,840
Cos I just worry they
can tell I'm on a wire.

248
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,760
But how about if I climb up the rope for
real, if you put enough tension in it,

249
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:51,200
and then I could just secretly hook the harness
through when I get to the top, just before the flash.

250
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,320
Cos when we did gym at school, I
was actually pretty damned nif...

251
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,840
God, you look like death
dug up. What's happened?

252
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,440
What happened is I went to bed last night in the
real world and woke up this morning in a Kafka novel!

253
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,600
You show her, I can't bear to look.

254
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:08,000
That gaff he made on Magic Relief turns out to
have been a bit of a gift to the internet satirists.

255
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,800
Witness first, the original clip
on YouTube.Thanks for coming.

256
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,960
Hi, I'm Klaus. Congratulations.

257
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:22,000
And then witness the spoof version, currently
riding rather higher on 600,000 hits.

258
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,920
Oh, that is incredible.

259
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,520
How've they done that?

260
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,840
Well, they'd have had to use a
very sophisticated CG programme.

261
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,680
The shirt, you're probably
looking at rotoscoping.

262
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,520
Could've been a frame by frame job, or
sometimes with a moving image you can just tell

263
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:43,080
it to lock onto a certain key point, and then
it'll just track that element for you as it goes...

264
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,520
Yes, thank you! Can you hear yourselves?

265
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,120
I'm up here planning Operation
Barbarossa, and you're talking pixels!

266
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,160
I've got to get on to PA or
something, lay down some sort

267
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,120
of formal apology before this
whole thing goes thermo-nuclear.

268
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,960
< Sweetheart, it's me...

269
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,560
Can you believe someone actually
sat up all night creating that?

270
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,080
I mean, you've got to give
them credit. PHONE RINGS

271
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,480
Yeah, hello? ..Oh, hi.

272
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,880
Listen, I am so sorry you
didn't get my text last night.

273
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,040
It's just I had this amazing
last-minute thing come up

274
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,440
and I had to dash off again,
after you'd come in specially.

275
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,400
'It was a bit of an
odd night in the end...'

276
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,880
I wound up with this guy I
met at a bus stop, who was...

277
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,200
Well, not all I thought he'd be, and...

278
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:36,720
Oh, God, really? No, you want to be careful, there
are some serious wack-jobs knocking about this town.

279
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:42,760
You could come a right cropper. Anyway, what I wanted
to talk to you about, what took me to your website,

280
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,680
it's like, all that stuff
I told you on the phone,

281
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,080
about this woman and the doctor,

282
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:55,320
is starting to really freak me
out now, cos the other day, right,

283
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,640
I was outside, near the wood shed...

284
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,280
I tell you, Joey, something's
going on in this house.

285
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,880
Something frightening.

286
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,920
'Like a treasure map or something.'

287
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,680
And this was hidden away
in the desk in his study?

288
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,200
Which she obviously
didn't want me to see.

289
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,640
It doesn't take a genius to work out, does it?
Someone's got it in for you round here, big time.

290
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,360
Dumbwoman's Lane?

291
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,960
Can't be many of them around.

292
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:32,680
Intriguing. And there was no sign of the soil being
turned over, or anything being dug up or buried?

293
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,320
In which case, what the hell was she
up to? I've been racking my brains.

294
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,520
Sounds as if you've got yourself a
real little House of Mysteries there,

295
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,120
with this, what's it
called, Green Lanterns place?

296
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,280
Should keep you busy for an hour or two.

297
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,520
Hang on, what's that strange
smacking noise I can hear?

298
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:56,640
Couldn't be the sound of you licking your lips at
the prospect of getting stuck into a case like this?

299
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,440
I had a dog like that once.
Made you feel so guilty if

300
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,880
you didn't keep throwing this
rubber ball at him all the while.

301
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:06,080
My trouble, I'm too good-natured
for my own good.Is that right?

302
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,600
Though I don't suppose Emily'd have a problem if
I brought in an office junior as a sounding board.

303
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,280
Oh, really. Well, you can just...

304
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,120
Emily?Do you know,

305
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:21,280
it's a bit old hat this, don't you
reckon, flying round the stage as a fairy?

306
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:26,360
What if I was, I don't know, like a
little imp or something, all in red.

307
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:31,280
And he could be dressed as maybe a wizard
or something, like in that Mickey Mouse film.

308
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,680
Might run it past him,
see what he thinks.

309
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,040
So when you were going to meet someone the
other night, and then couldn't make it...

310
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:42,760
Sorry?Yes, I might have a bit
of repair work to do there,

311
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,480
by the sound of things...

312
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,880
Oh dear.

313
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,960
How extremely unfortunate.

314
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,120
Oh, what've you found this time.

315
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,520
Hi, my name's Adam Klaus, and I just want
to take a moment before I go onstage...

316
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,240
What on earth possessed him to
record it in his dressing room?

317
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:05,880
..and do what I love doing most of all,
entertaining people of all races and creeds,

318
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:11,160
to register a big, heartfelt apology
for what I now realise was a stupid

319
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,320
and unguarded remark on my
recent trip for Magic Relief.

320
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,360
Anyone who really knows me,
knows my stance on the issue

321
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,160
of race relations could
not be more positive...

322
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,360
You can kind of see where it's going, I
think...It was the legendary Stevie Wonder who said

323
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,720
"Ebony and Ivory

324
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,760
"live together in peaceful harmony."

325
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,480
Man, I'm playing that piano.

326
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,600
So, this would be...?

327
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,280
Fairly simple colour key.

328
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,040
Amazing.

329
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,600
Oh, God. No!

330
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,200
Ow! Ow!

331
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,000
KNOCKING Emily? Emily, you OK in there?

332
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,840
What's happened?

333
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,240
What's the matter? Oh, you poor thing.

334
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,240
Shh, it's all right. It's all right.

335
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,600
It's all right.It was so real...

336
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,400
I was so frightened...

337
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,880
Mr Dore,

338
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,000
is everything all right?
I heard such screams.

339
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,240
No, it's OK. It's OK.

340
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,400
A bulb must have blown,
I think, that's all.

341
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,920
Watch where you're treading,
there's glass everywhere.

342
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,840
Do you want to go and reset
the fuses? Everything's fine.

343
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,040
I'm so sorry. It was just
that picture on the wall

344
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,560
frightened me half to death.

345
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,480
Really? What about the picture?

346
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,440
Well, it was...

347
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,000
I don't know now.

348
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:23,400
Maybe I just...OK. Look, Harriet,
she's probably just tired.

349
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,680
Come on, why don't we leave
you in peace, sleep it off?

350
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,000
One second. What do we have here?

351
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,800
What am I supposed to make of this?

352
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:06,520
Morning. I think you've
already met this person.

353
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,840
Emily, feel free to
tell me to bugger off.

354
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,280
Obviously, you're going
to be a mass of nerves.

355
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,560
Who wouldn't, with all the
madness that's going on round here?

356
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,680
Insecurities can play havoc

357
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,120
with your mental health,

358
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:29,440
as I unfortunately managed to demonstrate,
not very thoughtfully, the other night.

359
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,800
What he's trying to say is he's
such an anally fixated big-head,

360
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:36,720
he thought the only reason you wanted him
was for his world-famous powers of deduction.

361
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,840
As opposed to his charming
personality and animal magnetism.

362
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,560
But look, come on, you've got
to hang in here and not just go

363
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:51,880
imagining this woman's somehow taken over your mind,
making you write those weird notes and whatever.

364
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:56,080
That's just horror story time,
it's not real.Sometimes I think...

365
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,480
my whole life is a horror story.

366
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,960
That house that just disappeared.

367
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,800
The man in the grass.

368
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:11,520
It's like, maybe I can
see things sometimes

369
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,360
that aren't there any more.

370
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,720
You know, the mystery
of the vanishing cottage

371
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,280
may be the least challenging
of this whole puzzle.

372
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,920
And when you stop and think
about it, the man in the grass

373
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,400
would be part of the only
explanation that could possibly fit.

374
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,600
It's a bit of a flyer,

375
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:38,040
but the real clue to
what you saw that night

376
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,800
will almost certainly be the weather.

377
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:45,520
Excuse me, I'm very sorry to interrupt.
Jonathan Creek, is it? I'm Harriet.Joey Ross.

378
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:50,320
I'm afraid I'm going to have to steal your friend
for a while. Top guest room, Emily, in five minutes.

379
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:54,680
Some of that bed linen from the
other day really won't do, I'm afraid.

380
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,800
No, no, you jest. How could I object
to a visit from Jonathan Creek?

381
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,840
I mean, we plough a
similar furrow, don't we?

382
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,360
I plot them, you solve them. Murders.

383
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,200
I've not long been back here, of course.
The family home, this where we all grew up.

384
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:17,880
My brother and I, well, it
seems like ancient history now.

385
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,560
Till I took off overseas, earned a crust
or two, and then a couple of years ago,

386
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,560
fresh marriage, fresh start,

387
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:28,560
something seemed to just beckon me back.

388
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,520
The lingering air perhaps,
of Victorian mystery.

389
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,000
You'll be familiar, I imagine,
with the nuts and bolts of the case?

390
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,240
An absolute classic of
its kind, by all accounts.

391
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,840
Victim remotely positioned,
under constant observation,

392
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:51,200
succumbs to his fate at a
time precisely predicted.

393
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,720
The cause of his death never
resolved from that day to this.

394
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,920
Unsurprisingly, this Egyptian
femme fatale character

395
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,480
was not slow, after that,

396
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,720
to exploit her celebrity status.

397
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:13,680
I've ransacked her personal account of those
years for some sort of clue, how she did it, but...

398
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:24,520
Em, yes, riveting as all this is, of course, to
students of ancient history, there's a small matter

399
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:29,320
of unexplained death threats which I don't know if
anyone's taking very seriously, but...No, no, no,

400
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,440
it's most alarming,
particularly the one last night.

401
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,080
First of all, who
could have put it there?

402
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,200
And more to the point,
what the hell does it mean?

403
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,760
"Beware the approach of Isis."

404
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,280
Isis being? An ancient Egyptian
deity, fertility goddess if I remember.

405
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,720
Or a part of the River Thames in
Oxfordshire depending on your preference.

406
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,560
Picked up some interesting pieces
then, Mr Dore, on your travels.

407
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,360
Except for that one, funnily enough.

408
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,560
Discovered one day here in the attic.

409
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,840
It seems to date right
back to the earliest owner.

410
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,240
Some sort of primitive
reed instrument apparently.

411
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,480
Look, I'm going to have to
love you and leave you for now.

412
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,280
One or two calls to make, so
hopefully catch up with you later.

413
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,440
An Ellison Starberth Mystery.

414
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,040
You ever read any of these?

415
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,880
I'm afraid I have.

416
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,720
What?

417
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,880
No, it's just,

418
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,080
the way the dust in here's
been disturbed, I'd say this has

419
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,240
been very recently removed,
and then put back again.

420
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,080
So who's doing it?

421
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,240
Dodgy death threats
and phoney photographs.

422
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,000
You've only got a choice of three.

423
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,720
Or four if we count the spirit of
our Victorian witch, whatever she was,

424
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,080
who appears able to
re-materialise in a pile of logs.

425
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,960
Ah, now, I've got a pretty
good idea how that was done.

426
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,720
Father Alberic, how are you today?

427
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,920
I'm a bit earlier than I said, Mrs
Gantry, I hope it's not inconvenient.

428
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:14,480
Now, you'll correct me if I'm wrong here, I've no
doubt, but was there not a very old magic trick once

429
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:19,680
where you had this big sheet of glass on
the stage, tipped over at an angle, and then

430
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:24,800
some bod in the orchestra pit, who'd be reflected
upwards, to look all kind of eerie and translucent.

431
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:29,200
Pepper's Ghost. First
patented February 1863.

432
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:36,120
Which means all they'd have to do
would be to prop up their glass here

433
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,840
and then your ghostly actor, probably
just with this woman's photo stuck

434
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:45,720
on their face or something, would take up
position down below, underneath the open trapdoor.

435
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,040
HE SNEEZES

436
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:54,320
I should never make the mistake of stroking
a long-hair, they always set me off.

437
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:59,400
I'm sorry about that. He'll settle
down now, over there by the bird table.

438
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,120
Can I get you an antihistamine or...

439
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,560
I won't risk it with
the blood-thinners.

440
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:08,040
Heaven knows, I'm a walking
dispensary these days, Mrs Gantry.

441
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:14,080
They think there might be an early malignancy knocking
about somewhere. But apart from that, you're well?

442
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,360
You're not going to do anything
silly with that trap-door?

443
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,920
I know, but we don't want....

444
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,400
I suppose you're going to
say this is all my fault?Yes!

445
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,200
I mean, she comes in here every
day, at six, I think it is,

446
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,200
so it's not like we'll be
stuck down here forever.

447
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:39,360
Just the 5½ hours then, imprisoned in an airless
dungeon beneath half a hundredweight of tree stumps(?)

448
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,720
Why we both had to come down in the
first place, I'm not entirely sure!

449
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,880
Well, so we could check out that theory, see
if there was a sheet of glass that they...

450
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,120
Fortunately, I like nothing
better when trapped in a coal-hole,

451
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,240
than to curl up with a good book.

452
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,480
Might just help me to
forget about the fact that...

453
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:08,280
Yes, all right. I know what you're going to
say, so there's no need to say it, thank you.

454
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,920
What was I going to say?I know
exactly what you were going to say.

455
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,160
You don't need to make
things worse by saying it.

456
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,280
We should never have had those two
cups of coffee. Just shut up and read!

457
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:22,200
It was cos it was linen,
it was kind of hard to do.

458
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,120
Is that one, OK, though? I'm not sure.

459
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,600
No. And if I could just
see this one. Same problem.

460
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,200
So you've recently acquired
a new helper, I hear?

461
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,360
That'll all end in tears,
the way things are going.

462
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,640
And why he thinks I can't
manage on my own any more...?

463
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,360
I'm as fit as I ever
was, Father Alberic.

464
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,760
Fit enough, I hope, to come and buff up
my pews next Saturday at the usual time.

465
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:58,200
All right, I am now
officially very bored.

466
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,840
And very uncomfortable. These
cement bags are like rock.

467
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:08,640
Yes?I didn't say anything.Well,
would you mind saying something,

468
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:13,080
before I go completely stir-crazy?
What's that book told you so far?

469
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,680
So far, the victim was
one Dr Thadeus Northcote,

470
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:24,000
a prominent neuro-surgeon and known associate of
the eminent Victorian scientist Sir Francis Galton,

471
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:29,000
himself a close friend of Charles
Darwin.Skipping the prologue? Significant facts?

472
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,480
I don't know,

473
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,560
there's a whole bunch of photos in there
which may or may not tell us something.

474
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:42,680
Thing that keeps bugging me is this
business of the blood-curdling scream.

475
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,160
The fact that she screamed
and then he collapsed.

476
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:54,240
According to her, because the vision of Death
approaching struck terror into her heart.

477
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,160
It's clearly bollocks.

478
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,680
It's almost as if...

479
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:07,240
No. What is very persuasive is his theory that
she couldn't resist the idea of leaving some kind

480
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,080
of cryptic hint behind,

481
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:14,120
somewhere in the book,
about how she pulled it off.

482
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,080
It may be nothing, but if you look at
that dedication she's put in the front...

483
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,800
"With thanks to HCN,
none but we may know."

484
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,920
Northcote's wife was named Helen.

485
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,920
What, you think the two women
might've been in cahoots somehow?

486
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:36,480
I don't know. What I do know is I'm absolutely
going to burst in a minute if I don't...

487
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,600
Hang on a sec.

488
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,360
Light! Oh, I don't believe
this, what are the chances?!

489
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,600
That's the very thing!

490
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,120
Cement bags indeed.

491
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:56,040
You know what you've got
here, don't you?Do I? What?

492
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,200
Oh, you are jok.. Cat litter?

493
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,680
However long's this been
here? Thank you, God.

494
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,920
You're not seriously going to use that?

495
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,880
"All-natural,
instant-clumping clay formula."

496
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,520
Just hold that steady is all I ask.

497
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,440
Try not to wobble.

498
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:31,040
We're running a bit dry here, Mrs
Gantry. Any chance of a top-up?

499
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,520
Won't be two seconds. So you're managing
to get some down time, I hope, Father.

500
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,240
Oh, yes.Still hanging in
with the old carpentry?

501
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,480
I always say, if I have a vice, it's
to be screwed on the edge of a bench.

502
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,080
And that's got me into trouble
on more than one occasion.

503
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,640
Better?

504
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,280
You sure you don't want to...?

505
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,440
Much better, thank you.

506
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:59,920
There's plenty more there,
if you should feel the need.

507
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:02,720
How long's that coffee
had to percolate now?

508
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,240
A good 2½ hou...

509
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,040
Oh, God, no.

510
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:13,520
"Beware the approach of Isis."What?

511
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,800
That just took me back to
when we were in the kitchen.

512
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:19,400
Because what did that first note say?

513
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,400
"In three days you will be dead." Isis.

514
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,320
I think I know now what it means.

515
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:31,760
It's not a river or an ancient
Goddess.Well, what does it mean?

516
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:36,240
What it means, I've
got a horrible feeling,

517
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,760
is that Harriet Dore has only
got a minute left to live.

518
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,440
Thank you. Whoops. A drop more, Mr Dore?

519
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:21,840
What are you doing? Have you gone completely
insane?! Get your hands off me! Get away from me!

520
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,440
Dear God above.

521
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,960
Mrs Dore!You're mad!

522
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,920
Help me!

523
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:33,320
Help me, somebody, help me!
This isn't happening. Oh my God!

524
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,080
No! No!

525
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,800
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

526
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,040
Father, can you manage?Yes, yes.

527
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,640
Stay with me, my darling.

528
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:02,320
Oh, my God... All right, my darling.

529
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,680
Mr Dore, may God have mercy on us!

530
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,560
For God's sake, call for
a doctor, an ambulance!

531
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,960
Yes, yes. Absolutely. Oh, my precious...

532
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,480
In the name of God, who did this?

533
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:29,360
I couldn't stop her. She
dragged me across the room,

534
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:33,920
grabbed me by the throat and pushed me.

535
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,960
No!

536
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:42,600
I wasn't even there!

537
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,320
I'd just gone round to
put out the bins out,

538
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:49,760
ready for the... Oh, God!

539
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,200
She did it.

540
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,200
Emily! She murdered me.

541
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:32,280
For God's sake, just get her
away from here. Just leave us!

542
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:13,400
Officer, the young girl, she
can't have gone far. Find her!

543
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,840
Help! Is there anyone out there?!

544
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,920
HIGH-PITCHED NOISE

545
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:36,280
They had one of those, like,
police shrinks in here this morning.

546
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:39,440
Reckons I'm distorting
things in my mind,

547
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:44,080
blocking out what happened,
cos I can't bear to face it.

548
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:45,640
What do you think, Jonathan?

549
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,160
You believe I killed her?

550
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:55,280
I think it's what someone wants us to believe.
And they've gone to a hell of a lot of trouble

551
00:51:55,320 --> 00:52:01,720
to put this case together very convincingly.
And somehow, we've got to prise it apart.

552
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,760
And it's not impossible.

553
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:10,800
The weirdest things sometimes, that
don't add up, once they're explained...

554
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:14,120
That cottage you saw and then
didn't see, we've had a thought.

555
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:20,640
Never mind how unlikely the thought,
just run with the sheer, cold analysis.

556
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,680
A building cannot disappear.

557
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,280
It can't even seem to disappear.

558
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:30,920
But what looks like a building,
that can seem to disappear,

559
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:35,840
that could have been placed in that field
deliberately, in the middle of nowhere,

560
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,960
for a purpose that's unlikely
to occur to any of us.

561
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:53,040
These days, probably, no-one'd go
to the trouble of building the facade

562
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:58,840
of a fairytale cottage on location for
a scene in a movie now long forgotten,

563
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,320
pending the arrival of a
film unit in a few days' time.

564
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:07,200
When you first spot it, during a lull
in the wind, the illusion's complete.

565
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:11,800
A second later, our "night watchman"
character, there to keep an eye on the site

566
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,480
takes a nasty tumble.

567
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,320
One of those things, I suppose.

568
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:37,200
We'll never know now, will we?

569
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:40,000
But it does just show that...

570
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:43,720
No, I don't suppose we ever will.

571
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:55,640
We are all of us unique
and blessed before God,

572
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,480
and the tragedy of any
loss touches us all.

573
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:04,840
But while Harriet Dore
today is no longer flesh,

574
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:10,280
her spirit, I know,
walks among us still.

575
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,760
Quite a fair turn-out
then, you'd say, on the day.

576
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:17,440
Considering she was hardly famous
outside her publishing circles.

577
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:21,520
I doubt there's anyone round here
would have known her from a bar of soap.

578
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:27,000
But how prophetic were your words, Mrs Gantry
- "It'll all end in tears." Yes.

579
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,520
Excuse me for a moment.

580
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,960
So you'll be staying on,
will you, at the house?

581
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:40,520
Of course, he's talking now about selling
up and going back to the Far East to live.

582
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:45,960
So much to come to terms with.

583
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,240
And with this latest development,
one wonders if he'll ever get over it.

584
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,560
Latest development?
Oh, you haven't heard?

585
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:58,800
The coroner's report has
been knocking about for days.

586
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:03,480
Though if you want my opinion,
it was definitely news to him.

587
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:09,200
At the time of her murder, Harriet
Dore was eight weeks pregnant.

588
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,960
Morning! I was just trying it for size and I
seem to have broadened out a bit around the gills.

589
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,120
Sorry to disturb you. You need a hand?

590
00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:00,280
It may seem macabre, but I always
say, if you want a job doing...

591
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:05,680
And listen, I must tell you, Miss
Ross, I'm such a devotee of your work.

592
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:10,240
The way you put that case to bed last
year, the painting in the haunted attic.

593
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,960
Master-class in ratiocination.

594
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,240
I think some of these screws'll
have to come out.Right, of course.

595
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,760
If your Dr Watson chap is
acquainted with drills...Intimately.

596
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:27,440
No, just so we've got it right,
Father, order of events that day.

597
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:31,360
You were all sitting there at
the table, you heard all these

598
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:36,000
noises, and then you actually
saw her pushed out of the window?

599
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,640
It's a dreadful business, to be sure.

600
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:43,520
And so Emily was the only other
person around the house that day?

601
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:47,440
No way that looks good,
does it? DUCKS QUACK

602
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:51,240
That's my personal copy.

603
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,880
Well thumbed, of course. Like yourselves,
I find these things quite addictive.

604
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,960
Oh, and something interesting
I found out the other day,

605
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,840
Helen Northcote's middle
name was Catherine.

606
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:04,240
That's not in the book, of course.

607
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:07,080
Oh, really. But it
pretty much nails it then?

608
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:10,640
HCN? And if you're looking for
a weapon that could kill a man

609
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,800
in the middle of a lawn
without being seen or heard,

610
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,360
how about that blowpipe
we saw in his study?

611
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,520
What's-her-face screams, so he turns his
head, and gets it in the neck from the wife.

612
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,880
Excellent! You have the
mind of a true logician.

613
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:29,920
Though sadly, my dear, that object in the
glass case is no blowpipe. Far too short.

614
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:33,920
And there were no puncture marks or
poison darts anywhere on the body.

615
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:37,200
Also, I'm afraid, it was
Katherine spelt with a K.

616
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:40,200
Still, very interesting that you
bring it up, because when I was

617
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,200
there last week, discussing
the funeral arrangements...

618
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:51,640
I happened to notice that
pipe was no longer there.

619
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:58,720
It was an odd meeting
- he seemed to be burdened with the issue of man's accountability for his sins.

620
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:03,520
And the strangest request, he asked if he
might come to the church and undergo confession.

621
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:07,040
At which point, I'm afraid I had
to leave, when the cat came in.

622
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:11,400
Very low tolerance, you
see, to our feline friends.

623
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:15,600
And once the nasal
cavities start opening up...

624
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:18,280
And so, did he?Did he what?

625
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,160
Come to you for confession.

626
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:23,120
Oh, yes. The very next morning.

627
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,400
I can't tell you, obviously,
what he said to me.

628
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:34,520
Confidentiality of the box.

629
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:37,560
That as well, but mainly
because I fell asleep.

630
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,440
Most dreadful lapse on my part.

631
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:42,120
All the drugs one has to take,

632
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:45,240
at my age, I'm afraid
it's just... PHONE RINGS

633
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:50,680
Oh, sounds like me. It must've
dropped out.Oh, it's gone dead.

634
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,360
Oh, well, they'll call back.

635
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,920
Oh, that's interesting.

636
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:58,120
The Judas tree.

637
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,640
Come again? You recognise that?

638
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:05,320
Oh, yes, cercis siliquastrum?

639
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:09,960
Always seemed a misnomer
for such a lovely specimen.

640
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,640
But according to legend, of course,

641
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:18,800
this was the tree from which Judas Iscariot
hanged himself after betraying Our Lord.

642
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:21,080
Was there any reason, would you say,

643
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:25,600
Mrs Gantry, why Miss Somerton would
want the deceased out of the way?

644
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:30,760
Let me rephrase that, was there any
suggestion that she might have had

645
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,960
designs of her own on her employer?

646
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,800
I can't really recall.

647
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:39,640
Well, let me refresh your memory.

648
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:43,280
Was there an incident recently,
in the night, when you had occasion

649
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:47,280
to visit the accused's
bedroom when a light fused?

650
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,880
Well, yes.

651
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:54,760
And can you describe for us exactly
what you saw when you reached the room?

652
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,080
Mr Dore was there,

653
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:59,960
and Miss Somerton, the accused,

654
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,800
had her arms around him

655
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:06,720
and her head on his shoulder.

656
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:09,080
She had...

657
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:11,880
only her underwear on.

658
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,400
She was squeezing him very tightly.

659
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,200
I couldn't hear what she was saying.

660
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:26,000
Well, no. I saw no-one
push her exactly.

661
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:31,160
But you heard sounds of a violent struggle
going on, and your wife screaming at someone.

662
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:36,960
Yes.We've heard that the shred
of cloth that was in her hand,

663
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:41,120
it has now been confirmed, was
torn from the accused's dress.

664
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:44,480
And before she died, Mr Alberic,
can you tell us as precisely

665
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:47,560
as your memory will allow,
what were her last words?

666
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,080
She said, "She did it.

667
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:54,800
"Emily. She murdered me."

668
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:59,080
I'd be a lot closer to cracking this thing
if I knew what it was I was trying to crack.

669
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:04,120
Obviously, a major fit-up, but I
don't fancy her chances with that jury.

670
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:09,080
I don't know. Have you noticed there's a
lot of dodgy echoes of creepy movies here?

671
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:13,520
Gaslight and The Shining spring to
mind. And you wouldn't say the novels

672
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:16,920
of Hugo Dore were always noted
for their original plotlines.

673
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:24,240
All right, so he's found out
his wife's been playing around.

674
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:29,720
Decides to bump her off, but make it look
like the work of his amorous young housekeeper.

675
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:34,720
He knows she still has nightmares about some
weird experience that happened 20 years ago,

676
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:38,160
so he uses that back story
about our Victorian friend

677
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:42,320
to try and spook her into
believing she actually did it.

678
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,680
Question.Mmm?

679
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,000
What are we doing in this place?

680
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:51,640
The owners are in New Zealand, didn't she
say? The whole thing happened weeks ago.

681
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:57,520
But a bit of re-staging and elucidating
can sometimes just help to focus the mind.

682
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:02,240
OK, so you're coming up
the stairs, like she did.

683
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:10,760
And from inside the bathroom you hear...

684
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:19,120
I push open the door

685
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:32,040
and go to the basin.

686
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:37,640
So whoever it was just tucked
themselves in behind the door

687
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:43,280
while her back was turned, and then
slipped out again while she was...

688
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,520
So that's no big deal.

689
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,800
The only problem being, how could
they possibly know she was going

690
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:53,480
to come here in the first place, to set up a stunt
like that?Well, fairly obviously, they couldn't.

691
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,840
Which can only mean there's
something else going on in this house

692
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,400
that we've yet to get to the bottom of.

693
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:03,560
OK. More aimless foraging, I
think. You want to take upstairs?

694
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,080
I'll go down.

695
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:24,160
< LATCH CLICKS

696
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,720
DOOR SHUTS

697
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:36,720
All clear out here
now, when you're ready.

698
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:39,640
IN VASE:Yeah, actually, I
might need a bit of a hand.

699
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:45,240
Now, what do we suppose he came up here for?Hold
on, I think I've got cramp or something, in my knee.

700
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:56,480
Makes sense, I suppose, he'd use this
place for anything he wanted to hide.

701
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:01,840
Hello? Can you hear me out there?

702
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:04,600
I'm jammed solid! Hello?!

703
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:07,400
Ah! Aha!

704
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:13,520
Hidden, we can only assume, to prevent
its true function from becoming apparent.

705
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,960
Jonathan! Awhh!Fascinating.

706
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,360
And at this stage, of
course, the purest hypothesis,

707
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,840
but it would certainly all
slot together very neatly.

708
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:31,920
The scream in the garden, the light bulb
that blew in her room that night and...

709
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:39,600
..HCN. I mean, is that obvious or what? We
could have Googled it and got there quicker.

710
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:42,560
Jonathan, can I possibly
have your attention?!

711
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:46,400
I am seriously stuck in here! And short
of a ruddy Caesarean... Yes, hang on a sec.

712
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:49,440
What the hell have
you got yourself into?

713
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:52,040
I didn't have any choice, did
I, with the doors all locked.

714
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:53,920
Just pull.I'm going to
have to put it on its side.

715
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:56,720
Oh, God, that's not
helping one little bit.

716
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:59,960
Careful!

717
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,800
Pulling me arm out of it's
socket. How is this going to work?

718
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:06,480
Rocking about all over the
place. My bloody shoulder...

719
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:08,080
What's happening? Oh, oh, ah!

720
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:15,640
Oh, ow, ow! Ah ah ah! Oh, oh, aah!

721
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:20,240
SHE COUGHS

722
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:29,240
Hopefully it was insured.

723
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:33,000
Oh, give me some good news.

724
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:37,120
What was all that up there about
screams and gardens and light bulbs?

725
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,480
"Significant facts," was it, you said?

726
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:42,600
And what did I say about
our Victorian Dr Northcote?

727
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:46,080
That he was a close friend of
the scientist, Sir Francis Galton,

728
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:52,680
who, among his many varied achievements, is
widely credited as the inventor of the dog whistle.

729
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:59,000
120 years ago, thereabouts,

730
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:06,840
a previous housekeeper at Green Lanterns famously
put a curse on her employer that caused him to die,

731
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:11,400
apparently without any
physical explanation.

732
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:16,160
To an impressionable mind, the idea of
that malign presence still in the house,

733
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:20,040
somehow controlling her
actions, was fairly terrifying,

734
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:24,600
and may have had a direct bearing on
the run-up to Harriet Dore's death.

735
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:30,720
The mechanics of that first
crime, from all the evidence,

736
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:33,160
were pretty daunting.

737
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:38,080
A healthy man with a healthy
heart, in the middle of a lawn,

738
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:41,280
suddenly keels over and dies.

739
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:46,080
No marks or wounds were detected, no food
or drink that could have been poisoned,

740
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:51,000
there was no possible trigger that could
have caused his death at exactly 3.15,

741
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:58,360
the moment it was predicted, just a high-pitched,
blood-curdling scream that came from the bushes.

742
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,880
No significance to
that, fairly obviously.

743
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:08,280
Unless that scream was not a reaction...

744
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:14,440
..but the instrument of murder itself.

745
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:18,560
A scream that set in
motion something so lethal

746
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:22,800
that it could kill within
seconds, and then disappear,

747
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:25,800
quite literally, into thin air.

748
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:29,960
Hydrogen cyanide,

749
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:34,040
HCN,

750
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:37,400
could be pumped into a
small airtight container...

751
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:44,200
..and then sealed with a piece of glass
known to shatter at a certain frequency.

752
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:47,200
SHE SCREAMS

753
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:12,720
Fair to say you'd need specialist skills
to put something like that together,

754
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:16,560
but I think we can assume
that she had the contacts,

755
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:20,480
and that her powers of
persuasion were well up to it.

756
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:24,600
But where do we think the inspiration
for something like that would come from?

757
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:30,440
A prototype ultrasonic whistle,

758
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:34,200
known to be in Northcote's
possession at the time.

759
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:44,200
Too weak, certainly, to crack
a watch at that distance,

760
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:48,960
but used on a custom-made
replica light bulb,

761
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,720
just outside a bedroom door...

762
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:00,600
Lights are geared to go off all
over the house and, in the dark,

763
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:03,640
the picture's easily switched back.

764
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,400
That creepy photo

765
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:11,000
and the forged letters...

766
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:19,360
..and the apparition in the woodshed,
from the moment she arrived in the house,

767
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:23,720
were all part of an orchestrated
campaign to make Emily Somerton feel

768
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:27,760
and look like a woman out of
control, who was capable of murder.

769
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,360
INAUDIBLE

770
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:45,480
So let me just see if I
have this correct, Mr Creek.

771
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:50,480
Mr Dore, as a calculated
ploy to frame the accused,

772
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:55,080
has deliberately orchestrated
all the events you describe,

773
01:10:55,120 --> 01:11:01,640
and then pushed his own
wife out of the window.

774
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:05,160
How exactly, when he
was sitting at a table

775
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:10,080
on the far side of the garden
with two independent witnesses?

776
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:14,880
It wouldn't be the first case of this
kind where an accomplice was involved.

777
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:17,960
An accomplice who appears to have borne

778
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:23,640
a miraculous resemblance to Miss
Somerton, according to the deceased.

779
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:25,280
From her position in the room,

780
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:28,480
the way the light was coming
in through that other window,

781
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,720
she'd have been virtually in silhouette.

782
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:33,080
Bearing in mind all the death threats,

783
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:37,840
the victim's already primed
for her to try something.

784
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:40,440
The fact it was all over in seconds,

785
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:47,880
Harriet Dore saw exactly
what she expected to see.

786
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:56,160
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have
you now reached a verdict? We have.

787
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:59,240
Is it a unanimous verdict?It is.

788
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:03,400
On the charge of murdering Harriet
Dore, do you find the defendant,

789
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:06,720
Emily Anne Somerton,
guilty or not guilty?

790
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:10,560
Guilty.

791
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:20,720
"As she was led away to the cells, with a look of
barely disguised resignation, and many long years

792
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:23,680
"to reflect on her crime,
the defence team must have

793
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:30,240
"pondered the wisdom of fielding as their star
witness the self-styled 'magic sleuth', Jonathan Creek,

794
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:33,760
"whose ludicrous musings and
utterly improbable reasoning

795
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:37,560
"would have stretched any jury's
credulity to breaking point."

796
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,720
The thing is, they're right.

797
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:46,760
All that guff I cobbled together
about an accomplice in silhouette

798
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,880
and "seeing what she expected to see",

799
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:52,760
doesn't get near to explaining
what happened that day.

800
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:56,320
And the more you turn it all over,
the more you realise that Hugo Dore

801
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:59,480
was a whole lot smarter
than we gave him credit for.

802
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:03,040
To kill someone in such a way...

803
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:08,000
that the victim is going to accuse the
wrong person seconds before they die,

804
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:10,880
it's bordering on psychopathic genius.

805
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:15,760
Of course, there is
one other possibility,

806
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:18,440
which we both know is
staring us in the face.

807
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:22,840
You know what I'm saying, Jonathan.

808
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:25,520
Cos I know what it is

809
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:31,280
to believe in someone that much, to
build your whole future on someone,

810
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:35,000
because it's something you know
and feel, deep down, is right,

811
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:38,320
with every instinct you ever trusted.

812
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:42,920
And, you know, that
is absolutely the way,

813
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,960
the true and perfect way,

814
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,600
to get shat upon from a great height.

815
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:50,440
I know.

816
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,440
I know you know.

817
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:54,320
And it makes no difference, does it?

818
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,600
None whatsoever.

819
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:01,880
So, which of the many drawing
boards do you want to go back to?

820
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:13,760
I suppose it's a lot to hope for, it's
suddenly going to just fall into place.

821
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:17,360
Except somewhere here is the
key to how it was all worked.

822
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:25,040
You just hope for some slight glimmer.

823
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:57,040
Teaspoon?Where he dropped
his cup when it happened.

824
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:00,680
'Course...

825
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:04,800
Cos he's allergic to cats.Excuse me?

826
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:09,960
Cos they never made it
clear, did they, in court,

827
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,520
which table they were sitting at.

828
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:15,800
But if the cat was over
there, with the birds,

829
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:18,400
the only one they could
have been sitting at...

830
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,440
Amazing.

831
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:28,320
It's only when you're
actually here, you can see it -

832
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:31,320
the solution to the whole trick.

833
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:36,560
And it pretty much explains, I think, who
was washing their hands in that bathroom.

834
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:50,080
OWL HOOTS

835
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:28,320
Darling, I'm afraid we've got company.

836
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:31,920
Actually, we were just passing.

837
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:39,600
So, I wonder what you've got to say
about all this now then, Jonathan?

838
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:45,040
What would Ellison
Starberth say at this point?

839
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:49,880
We know that between you, you've pulled off as cynical
and staggering a deception as I've ever come across,

840
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:52,840
in order to incriminate
an innocent young woman.

841
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:58,800
Convincing us all that you'd fallen to your
death that day, impaled on a set of metal spikes.

842
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:01,240
Just a bit impressive.

843
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:08,160
Although we're still quite curious, it has to be
said, what it is keeps bringing you back to this place,

844
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:09,720
to the Judas Tree.

845
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:23,320
An unnaturally deep concern,
it would seem, for its welfare.

846
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:38,080
If it weren't for the location,

847
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:42,760
I'd almost be prepared to guess
it was one of you that planted it.

848
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:46,480
You're angling for the truth, Jonathan.

849
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:48,720
I wonder if you've
got the stomach for it?

850
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:53,280
Go on...Look, we don't
have to play this game.

851
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:55,840
Let them work for it,
they're so bloody smart.

852
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:01,000
Oh God, I just got that shiver.

853
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:05,280
This is like when people lay
flowers at the side of the road.

854
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:08,440
Something happened here.

855
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:13,200
Something horrible.

856
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:18,800
Someone close to you?

857
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:21,960
It's the strangest thing, you know?

858
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:26,480
Growing up with an older brother,

859
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:28,000
who's younger than you.

860
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:34,040
Strange, but constantly fulfilling.

861
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:38,200
Today we call these people "special".

862
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,960
Well, Danny was certainly that.

863
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,640
A child at 27,

864
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:53,200
born into a world he couldn't
possibly hope to understand.

865
01:19:55,880 --> 01:20:00,360
Stop! Stop! Stop the car!

866
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:05,400
Please, get out! I don't know
what to do. Can you help us?

867
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:09,520
Thank you so much. She's just there.

868
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,080
Straight ahead.

869
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,920
It's my ankle.

870
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,440
Shit!

871
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,480
SHE SCREAMS

872
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:00,600
DULL THUD

873
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:08,920
He survived just long
enough to paint the picture.

874
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:24,960
Of course, when they finally picked
them up, and took it to court,

875
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,160
two sweet young girls,

876
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:29,800
forced to defend themselves against
a man of proven mental inadequacy.

877
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:32,040
Of course all the
evidence went their way.

878
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:34,720
..Not guilty. SHE EXCLAIMS

879
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:54,000
But you got past it.

880
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:56,240
For 20 years,

881
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:59,520
left the country, changed your
name when your career took off.

882
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:02,560
It's only since you got back,

883
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:04,240
something,

884
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:10,640
or someone, persuaded you it
was time to settle that score.

885
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:13,280
It's not very fashionable, but...

886
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:17,640
sometimes I think you have to
meet brutality with brutality.

887
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:20,200
So what happened?

888
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:21,880
You tracked them both down?

889
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:30,680
Decided they were going to pay for what
they'd done, one with a jail sentence,

890
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:33,240
the other with her life.

891
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:49,400
Echoes of movies should really
have got me there sooner.

892
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:52,520
Cos the way you did it was
straight off a film set, wasn't it?

893
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:59,760
Only instead of using a stunt performer,
who might just pass muster in the wide shot,

894
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:02,600
you did something quite barbaric.

895
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:04,720
..OK.

896
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:07,440
As Emily leaves the bedroom,

897
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:11,560
your two independent witnesses are
already taking up their positions,

898
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,920
in the one part of the garden
where the illusion will work.

899
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:21,920
So at 3.15, as per your
cryptic death threat...

900
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:25,320
Have you gone completely
insane?! Get your hands off me!

901
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:28,880
Help me! Help me, somebody!

902
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:31,360
SHE SCREAMS

903
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:41,800
A matter of seconds, you're
downstairs, behind the gate.

904
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:09,200
By the time the other two get
there, the switch has been made.

905
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:11,640
So seamlessly no-one suspects a thing.

906
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:16,680
And, of course, you'd already been at
that fringe on her dress beforehand.

907
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:19,400
After they've gone, you
make the switch back.

908
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:22,160
Police, paramedics, undertakers,

909
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:27,080
all take the whole thing at face
value. You've identified the body.

910
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:29,320
And as we heard the other week,

911
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:33,560
no-one round here knows
Harriet Dore from a bar of soap.

912
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:36,080
When Emily took cover in that house,

913
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:41,000
she couldn't have known how
close she was to the truth.

914
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:59,880
So that was the perfect hidey-hole for
a week or two, till things blew over?

915
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:03,800
And since then, what?
A hotel room somewhere,

916
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:08,080
sitting it out till a few months'
time, you'd be back together, overseas.

917
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:14,080
That wooden pipe, it turned out, wasn't
that much of a clue in the scheme of things.

918
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:16,800
If you hadn't made such a
big deal about hiding it.

919
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:24,040
The curse of a crime writer,
exploiting all those parallels.

920
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:27,320
Just seemed to knit it all together.

921
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:30,440
And that mess in the hall, I
take it, was your handiwork...

922
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,120
..the day I went back
for those reading glasses.

923
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:40,600
It never flowered, you see,

924
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:43,000
that was always the beauty of it.

925
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:45,400
Splendid pink blossom

926
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,320
in early spring.

927
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:51,920
So what now?

928
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:56,840
If this were a detective novel...

929
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:01,080
You'd hang yourself from one of
the branches, cloaked with shame,

930
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:05,360
I'd turn myself in and
your friend would go free.

931
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:07,840
The real world, sadly, is
not so neatly structured.

932
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:11,360
They didn't believe your story last
time, you think they'll believe this one?

933
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:14,320
All right, her condition...

934
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:18,160
we had no idea about. Would it have
made a difference? I don't know.

935
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:22,800
But I do know it was a lunatic idea,
coming out here in the first place tonight.

936
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:25,400
Can I suggest, sweetheart, whatever
we need to discuss at this stage of

937
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:29,080
the game, we discuss another
time, another place?Of course.

938
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:34,240
But, of course, when I got your text, it seemed
so urgent... My text? Hang on, it was you...

939
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:38,160
Oh, I can't believe it...

940
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:39,920
This was a setup?

941
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:42,840
Don't look at us.

942
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:47,040
Then, who?

943
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:55,040
I suppose it was a betrayal of
trust and confidence, in a sense,

944
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:58,640
but when he found out, you see,

945
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:03,160
an innocent life had been lost
in that whole gruesome business...

946
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:08,640
..that's when he felt the
need to declare his crime.

947
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:11,000
INDISTINCT

948
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:13,560
HE SNORES

949
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:27,560
And then my dilemma,
of course, was no less.

950
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:32,000
That information was sacred,
and not for me to pass on.

951
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:40,040
But when I spotted you out there last
night, in the garden, it did occur to me.

952
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:45,960
A couple of urgent text messages
would bring them and us together.

953
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:52,240
But as you say, it does all
feel rather final somehow.

954
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:57,440
The hand of God, do we think,

955
01:27:57,480 --> 01:27:59,040
balancing our lives?

956
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:05,120
Our sins are never forgotten.

957
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:10,800
Our punishments,

958
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:12,320
merely deferred.

959
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,360
DOOR LOCKED

960
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:37,560
Oh.

961
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:40,040
Oh, dear.Bad news?

962
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:45,280
It's from Mr Karswell,
the deacon at St Patrick's.

963
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:49,360
Father Alberic.

964
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:53,240
They found him two nights ago.

965
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:00,400
He'd apparently made a DVD.

966
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:02,080
'We are all of us unique

967
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:08,400
'and blessed before God and the
tragedy of any loss touches us all.

968
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:13,160
'But while I am, today, no
longer flesh, my spirit, I know,

969
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:16,560
'walks among you still.'

970
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:20,640
As he said, if you want a job doing.

971
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:26,520
'It's a well-worn phrase, the Lord
took him to early. But you know,

972
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:31,600
'I've had a long and fulfilling
life in the service of our saviour.

973
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:33,720
'Even shared his interest in woodwork.

974
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:36,520
'An example of my efforts,
as a matter of fact...'

975
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:53,080
Now I know I speak for most people here when I
say I'm sick and tired of being lectured to by

976
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:58,720
white middle class intellectuals, about what
I am and what I'm not meant to be offended by.

977
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:03,120
Believe it or not, we don't need to be
patronised, we can think for ourselves.

978
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:08,000
And what I know about this guy is that he's
real, he's sincere, and he's got it here.

979
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:10,720
And we're proud to have him
on the roll call tonight,

980
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:17,200
working for The Race Against Racism, would
you please give it up for Mr Adam Klaus.

981
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:19,760
CHEERING OK, folks,
let the show commence!

982
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:37,880
HE STOPS CLIP

983
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:42,400
HE STARTS CLIP

984
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:52,600
How was lunch?Enrico Caruso could
scarce have sung its praises.

985
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:56,560
And we had a fine and fertile discussion,
did we not, on the future course of the act.

986
01:30:56,600 --> 01:31:00,360
You could say my John Dore was
drizzled with creative juices.

987
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:02,040
I don't think I'll bother.

988
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:05,880
And talking of Dores,

989
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:08,080
are you over the worst yet? Bless him.

990
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:11,240
Cos you've got to be
gutted after all that?

991
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:15,480
But listen, you know what I've been
thinking, that police shrink she said about

992
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:19,880
might've been onto something, when she talked
about blocking out things that have happened?

993
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:24,560
It wouldn't surprise me if she had absolutely
no recollection of that stuff with his brother.

994
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:29,440
Like she'd airbrushed it all out of
her head, the court case, everything.

995
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:32,080
You read about all that
bollocks, like a kind of denial.

996
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:36,560
And yet she remembered
the man in the grass.

997
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:39,000
Well, selective maybe.

998
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:41,280
Who knows? Anyway, I'll just be a sec.

999
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:48,680
So, last night's gig. Did you log on yet, see
whether we made it in one piece on to YouTube?

1000
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:51,640
Er, yes. Yes, it's certainly on there.

1001
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:54,000
It's very much as you'd expect.

1002
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:55,640
Well, let me see.

1003
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,120
Right.

1004
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,640
There's one version.

1005
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:18,040
Oh, what have we here?

1006
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:22,520
Uh, yes, I think someone
did also post something...

1007
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:24,040
different.

1008
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:41,920
What they've done there, it's quite interesting
actually, they've used these straight lines up here...

1009
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:45,160
Like the diagonals on the hat.

1010
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:47,240
Basic reference points.

1011
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:52,520
To make it easier to matte in
the Klansman's hood over my face.

1012
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:55,000
Exactly... HE STOPS PLAYBACK

1013
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:56,520
Isn't that interesting?

1014
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:03,680
Now, I just have to remind myself,
whose idea was it to stage this

1015
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:08,320
whole routine dressed as a
"grand wizard" in the first place?

1016
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:11,600
Cos I know it wasn't you.

1017
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:16,160
Oh!

1018
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:18,360
There's a coincidence.
What?

1019
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:22,680
Just coming up to 3.15.

1020
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:41,440
