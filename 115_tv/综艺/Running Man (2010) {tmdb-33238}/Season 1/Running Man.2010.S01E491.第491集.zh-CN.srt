3
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:29,890
From a novel by Lars Görling
Director Vilgot Sjöman

4
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,880
(The play at the theatre is "A Dream Play" by August Strindberg)

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
English subtitles made from the soundtrack by Aliquis

6
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,410
A minute ago
I spoke to our inspector.

7
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,220
He's not happy with your attitude.

8
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,300
I wonder, can you imagine

9
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,270
the amount of effort and money
we've put into this?

10
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,920
This isn't a kind of police interrogation
if that's what you think.

11
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,940
You are to be enlisted
in a control group.

12
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:22,240
It won't be easy
to enrol Nisse to science, inspector.

13
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,480
I don't think he really understands
the importance we put on this survey.

14
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,920
Oh, you do, don't you Nisse?

15
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,200
Not a single word you utter
within these walls...

16
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,200
will ever get to the police.

17
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,350
This is a scientific survey;

18
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,350
purely scientific.

19
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:42,140
If you should find a question ...

20
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:46,550
too awkward, you can deny to answer it.
You know that.

21
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,550
We have a purpose, Nisse...

22
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,720
to create new and better treatments.

23
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,400
to prevent boys like you
from getting into the police records.

24
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,130
In helping us you're helping yourself.

25
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,920
and in the same time you help us
to develop the society one step.

26
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,220
The other guys might not realize that.

27
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,820
But you do!

28
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,480
A boy with an energy
and an initiative like yours ...

29
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,110
No, it'd be a loss...

30
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,350
to let such qualities
be worn down behind bars.

31
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,930
How is life upstairs?

32
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,730
Yes, it's a bit basic,
but the best we had on hand.

33
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,420
Are you getting along
with the other boys?

34
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,800
Well then.

35
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,630
I'll leave you now.

36
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,600
Don't forget this is to your own decision, Nisse.

37
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,600
Totally to your own decision.

38
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,020
No one in "The Objectivity"
would ever dream of compelling you to join.

39
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,550
My own decision?

40
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,620
Had I not accepted
I'd been handed over to the cops.

41
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,490
I had no options!

42
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,370
Egon had to face the same choice
and four of the others.

43
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,130
Well, we all work in different fields...

44
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,010
pinching cars, blowing safes, shop-lifting,

45
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,240
living with whores.

46
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,250
Now we're all put together
in a worn-down house on Mäster Samuel Street.

47
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,080
for a psychological survey
to a purpose we knew nothing about.

48
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:17,670
more than we had to be at The Objectivity
for tests every morning.

49
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,430
"The Objectivity
Juvenile Pension"

50
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,060
Doesn't anyone here
have one single buck to spare?

51
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,390
Shit, they're forcing us to break up everything!

52
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,380
No fags, no movies,
not a shit!

53
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,300
- You have at least a nice bed.
- A bed!

54
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:38,610
I have my quarters in Högdalen.

55
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,990
It's good enough for me!

56
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,420
They took it from me!
Hell, then at least I had some money.

57
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,050
Krister is coming.

58
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,750
Hi.

59
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,630
Hi.

60
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,280
Were you late too?

61
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:14,930
Follow me and let's see
if we can make some kind of arrangement.

62
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,580
Did you visit The Objectivity today?

63
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,580
Did you go to college here?

64
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,270
Nowadays it's called 'university'.

65
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,720
- Bought this newly?
- Yes.

66
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,970
I'm curious of that one.
'Semantics'.

67
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,890
Do you know of that?

68
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:50,040
Semantics claims that most differences
of opinions do not really exist.

69
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,040
It's a matter of linguistic.

70
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:57,920
Many a conflict is due to the fact
that spoken language is such a blunt tool.

71
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,010
- Well.
- There's a point in that.

72
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,680
- Have you thoughts about the university yourself?
- No.

73
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,680
You've made a start already.

74
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,820
'A start', for being here one term?

75
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,380
Well ... how was The Objectivity today?

76
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,990
I don't want to appear repetitive, but in fact ...

77
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,990
I've told you many times.

78
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:26,230
So ... do you know what day it is?
Friday, payday.

79
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,230
Payment.

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,960
- Gifts of grace. Bloody charity.
- Be grateful. It's better than nothing.

81
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,310
What a bloody mess.
How the hell can you live like this?

82
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,890
Keep your position in mind.
You are everyone's voice here.

83
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,900
- You cannot bloody live like this.
- Easy now, I haven't settled down yet.

84
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,600
When the new furniture will arrive,
and I'll have the time for my studies ...

85
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,570
In this mess.

86
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,890
You heard.
It'll all be here within some days.

87
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,890
They promised the curtains
will be here tomorrow.

88
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,040
Egon, Egon please, calm down!

89
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,530
Splinted wood for you.

90
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,690
Speaking of cleaning up,
you owe me two bucks, and so do you.

91
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,170
- I conned you.
- You're conned yourself.

92
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,000
Who did you think cleaned up your quarters?

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,150
Kiss my ass!

94
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:28,450
What's the matter with you?
Please, hold up, will you.

95
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,770
- Pyret, is this really necessary?
- Every darn piece of shit.

96
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,920
Kick that hell of a box off my sight!

97
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,370
He's sick in the head.
Soiling everything in his way.

98
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,500
- What did he do to you?
- That's not the question.

99
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,040
Soiling everything.
What about payment?

100
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,660
Shouldn't we make the best out of t this situation?

101
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:59,930
- Egon, nothing will be better...
- Whatever, I will smash the other box too.

102
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,130
Where's Butcher?

103
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,690
I can sign on his behalf.

104
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Don't let yourself be tricked by him, Krister.

105
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,550
'Tricked'?
Don't you think I'll give him the money?

106
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,220
All of us aren't a rotten egg like you.
Bloody bastard!

107
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,320
Ten bucks a week!
To hell with it.

108
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,140
Ten bucks a week to the guinea pigs.

109
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,810
That's quite a lot for a guinea pig ...

110
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,280
if it doesn't smoke.

111
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,230
So go on use your snuff!
You can afford that, you bastard.

112
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,470
«Pyret is a sleepwalker from time to time,
and talks in his sleep.»

113
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,440
«Egon sleeps like a ball.»

114
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,850
«If he was awaken too abruptly,
his arms bounced fiercely in all directions.»

115
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:31,850
«With force.»

116
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,250
«Jingis sleeps on a rubber sheet.
He's a bed wetter.»

117
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:40,800
«He use to piss either in the morning
or directly after he falls asleep.»

118
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,930
That darn old hag.

119
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,090
When she makes cocoa
it barely fills an egg-cup each...
at the most.

120
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,040
And tomorrow we'll have turnips...

121
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,040
with stewed concrete.

122
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,550
Get your pissed sheets out of here.

123
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,630
I could do some scratching
in the box of the old hag.

124
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,800
She's the boss, isn't she?

125
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,770
She should be removed.

126
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,410
She?
The whole bloody Objectivity.

127
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,530
We could do well on our own.

128
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:20,150
- Krister and we.
- And start a kind of labour union.

129
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,980
We have a chairman.

130
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,840
Not at all a bad idea.

131
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,300
Chairman of "United Thieves Union'...

132
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,780
with a salary.

133
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,670
Really...

134
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,990
Were do we keep the funds?
In the vault of The National Bank?

135
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,970
Well, don't you trust me?

136
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,110
Do you think I'd run off with the loot?

137
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,660
We must have four cashiers,

138
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:53,080
constantly watching each other;
grumpy, mistrusting blokes.

139
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,420
Two locks and two safes.

140
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:59,680
Two vaults and two of everything
to prevent every single bastard from entering.

141
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:07,000
Look at those poor,
bloody blue collars.

142
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,000
Bloody blue collars!

143
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,420
They are as good robbers as are we ...

144
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,420
only they don't call it stealing.

145
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:25,230
They call it 'fringe benefits', 'borrowing'
and bloody other names.

146
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,570
And drunken driving.
Could that be a habit?

147
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,210
"Some boozing every now and then."
"So what?"

148
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,190
What's the worst,

149
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,870
get your car and some money stolen..

150
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,630
or get a year for drunken driving?

151
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,540
...Or get juvenile reformatory.

152
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,810
A bloody car they'll get back in a couple of hours,

153
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,090
money they don't honestly own.

154
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,390
Do you believe in God, Krister?

155
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,310
I do.

156
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,930
Be careful with 'Godly'!

157
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,070
When he's hungry
he roams the streets and eats your kind.

158
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,000
Nisse!

159
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:54,330
Well, social developing merely tiptoes.

160
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,970
Our ability to take care of each other ...

161
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:00,360
does not develop in the same rate
as technology and standards.

162
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,680
Nisse. Nisse!

163
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,840
Eh ... leave that door, please.

164
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,550
Come, take part in our conversation instead.

165
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,530
I do see your uneasiness.

166
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,850
It's tragic that some people must suffer
due to this long-winded development.

167
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,300
They didn't care!
They didn't do a bloody thing to help me.

168
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,900
But now I only wish to be left alone.

169
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:26,640
You speak of The Objectivity,
and yet you've never been in their claws.

170
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,520
My God, what have you done?

171
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,780
Don't you stand the sight of blood?

172
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,270
Are you grinding mincemeat?

173
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:38,550
You scumbag,
can't you see the guy's wrecked himself?

174
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,430
Wrecked himself?
It's self-inflicted.

175
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,420
You complain of injustice,
told by others.

176
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,820
- Then you judge yourselves the hardest.
- That's our business, isn't it?

177
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,190
Who's complaining did you say?

178
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,830
Fish, go and get the first aid kit.
Hurry, please.

179
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,150
I made complaints
to point at the inequities.

180
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,180
Take it easy.
They love to whine.

181
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,540
Who do you mean?
Who's whining did you say?

182
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:03,010
Whine yourself, you puny,
bloody, shitty, rotten louse.

183
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,010
Stop this, Egon! Please.

184
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,690
- What the hell are you ...?
- Egon!

185
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,650
This was so very unnecessary.

186
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,520
Should I have let him
use his knife? Should I?

187
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,480
Shall I just be standing here
and take all ...

188
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,020
You know him.

189
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,850
You didn't have to be that brutal.

190
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,900
Bloody socialist, bloody ass,

191
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,920
bloody inspector, bloody superintendent,

192
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,830
bloody Djurgården-fan!

193
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,830
And I shall take all this?
He started!

194
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,100
Bloody chief editor, bloody clerk,

195
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,230
bloody custom officer, bloody criminal inspector,
bloody assistant secretary!

196
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,670
My father is a principal assistant secretary.

197
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,480
My old man's brain was so rotten
that he even had to rape my mom.

198
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,990
He had to fuck her for three weeks
before he could lit his fireworks.

199
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,990
And she was howling all the time,

200
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,990
because he bloody hurt her.

201
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
His dick was as large as a horse's dick.

202
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,110
My gosh!

203
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:59,280
If my father got to know
that I'd done such a bad thing, he'd hated me.

204
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,700
«...because she got syphilis,
and when I came ...»

205
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,350
«And it took three weeks
because it was so darn hot.»

206
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:11,000
«Then she howled because my old man
wouldn't leave her alone.»

207
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:16,740
«She was so tight,
that I had to creep out through her ass hole.»

208
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,200
She made no difference to your ol' man
when you'd arrived.

209
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,570
That bony bitch.

210
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:25,400
Your whore of a mother,
had to beg for a lay,

211
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,410
When she didn't get it,

212
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,410
she ran to the Monkeys at the Zoo.

213
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,920
She found a half-witted ape
and raped him ...

214
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,600
Your father!

215
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,390
Strange, isn't it?

216
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,230
Don't puke in here!

217
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,160
Do your puking in the bathroom!

218
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,550
If you think we'll wipe up,
you're dead wrong.

219
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,460
Lick them up yourself!

220
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,910
You bloody runt!

221
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,110
- Egon!
- You dumb-ass!

222
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,540
If you cannot stop fighting,
you'll end up at the hospital.

223
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,470
- Shall we...?
- No.

224
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,640
Something fishy about this.

225
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,640
Why does he keep it locked?

226
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,020
I bet he's keeping a whore in there.

227
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,680
Really?
But how does she get fed?

228
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:45,980
«If you want to make a key,
you must buy two or three blanks;»

229
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,850
«if you should file too much
on the first one.»

230
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:53,790
«The part of a key you are filing
is called 'the bit'.»

231
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,780
«It could do with an imprint.»

232
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,510
«After some filing,
cover the bit with molten wax.»

233
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,290
«Then you turn the key in the lock,»

234
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,300
«to see where the key does not fit.»

235
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,450
«If it doesn't fit already, that is.»

236
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:13,530
«Well, I made a key ...
to that door.»

237
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:18,500
«He had no right to hide things.»

238
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,180
«They feel betrayed,
all the time,»

239
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,180
by every person on every level.

240
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,740
There, there now.

241
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,330
Take some advice from an old colleague:

242
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:20,070
Pay heed not to identify yourself too much
with the objects we study.

243
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:24,190
What's the use
if I cannot identify myself with them?

244
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:28,330
Who else should put forward their complaints?
They cannot!

245
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,660
Good.

246
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:36,920
Good.
You keep your fangs sharp.

247
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,770
We need your ability to protest.

248
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,920
Our Swedish society would wither away,
if there were not ...

249
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,360
younger people ...
who could stand up for a cause.

250
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,730
Sometimes I dream about
a kind of Final Judgment.

251
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,290
Not of the judgment per se ...

252
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,840
but to enable everyone to see clearly ...

253
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,830
and to disable the ability
to close your eyes.

254
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,060
And then a great silence ...

255
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,080
so all ears could rest
from all explanations.

256
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,200
No investigations, ...

257
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,410
no denials.

258
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,290
Nothing.

259
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,550
No possibilities to escape,
to defend or to make excuses.

260
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,440
We have become so talented!

261
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,560
What are you doing in here?
How did you get in?

262
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,590
Who allowed you to ...

263
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,370
Jingis?

264
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:53,620
Jingis!

265
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:55,620
Stop!

266
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,120
Stop, Jingis!

267
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,540
Are you angry, Krister?

268
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,720
Not exactly angry but ...

269
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:13,130
Come forth, Nisse.
Krister is not angry.

270
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,910
This grand piano belonged to my mother.

271
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,910
I was just playing a little.

272
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,910
Go on playing, Jingis.

273
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,340
Krister is all happy if it's used,
and no longer is kept hidden.

274
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,390
- It belonged to my mother, Nisse.
- Where is she?

275
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,620
I just played from memory.
I never touched the music sheets.

276
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,830
Well, Krister didn't know
that you play the piano.

277
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,690
This is nothing.
I can play much better.

278
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,230
Jingis. Jingis, please!

279
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,470
Do keep on playing, Jingis.

280
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,410
He doesn't mean it.

281
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:07,060
He wouldn't make you second
to his dead old mother.

282
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,320
Of course you can play it sometimes.

283
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,860
Occasionally.

284
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,740
Well, it never occurred to me.

285
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,050
I'm sorry.
It never came into my mind.

286
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,010
It's nice in here.

287
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,210
Maybe we should leave.

288
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,340
Or we could invite the others.

289
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,030
Maybe you don't want to?

290
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,200
Why did you never mention,

291
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:40,920
that you had a secret room,
so nice that we could not be invited.

292
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,500
You'd better have the key.

293
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,620
If so, I can make a new one.

294
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,740
I don't really feel I've let your down,
by not mentioning this room.

295
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,900
Come on, Jingis.

296
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,790
Then I gave my opinion
of him, that bastard.

297
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,400
Of course he boiled over.

298
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,530
And the girl?
What became of her?

299
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,590
She? She had no options.
I was the only one left.

300
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,530
What the heck. She had to pay me
for fucking that guy.

301
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,710
So I sent her in the street
to work and get some money for booze.

302
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,710
You bet we had a nice time.

303
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,560
In bed, I mean.

304
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,430
It reminds me of that babe
I met in the Old City.

305
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:33,110
I remember an old lady
who tricked me into her flat.

306
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,370
I lived in the Kransen some years ago,
and there also lived this gorgeous babe.

307
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,220
One at a time please.
I have time for you all.

308
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,200
Let Pyret continue.

309
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:45,320
Oh ... What do I see?.
The later the day, the better the guests.

310
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,520
Do join us.
Here's space enough.

311
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,730
Do enter.

312
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,400
I was twelve; went to school.

313
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,860
There was this old hag
my mother used to talk to.

314
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,430
One day she invited me to her flat.

315
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,380
I had no second thoughts,
so I stepped in.

316
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:07,910
Well, I had noticed
her eager eyes on me sometimes;

317
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,530
and some fondling now and then.

318
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,450
So what?
She was an old lady for god's sake!

319
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:15,540
How old was she?

320
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:19,740
How should I know?
... Well, around 30 years.

321
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,350
Anyhow, she said she could mend my trousers.

322
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,030
No, it started with me
fixing a lamp for her.

323
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:30,700
What the fuck.
I didn't strip off my trousers that easy.

324
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:33,620
Then she started this fondling thing.

325
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,610
Of course I got exited!

326
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,160
I had never done it before.

327
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,380
And?

328
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,550
Well, I had a pretty nice time.

329
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:45,260
She must have felt the same.
She was moaning and all that.

330
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,990
Then she never left me alone.
She was watching for me every day.

331
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:52,570
If I said I wasn't in the mood,
she gave me chocolate and stuff.

332
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,230
When you didn't fuck?

333
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:58,230
She had had a hard life.
She and my mom used to talk about that.

334
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,310
Did your mom never find out?

335
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,820
Well, there were rumours.
Of course I denied it fiercely.

336
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:06,540
But I wasn't allowed
to visit people any more.

337
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,880
And you obeyed
your mother of course?

338
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,590
She never left me alone!

339
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,560
I hardly dared
to go home after school.

340
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,520
I know a similar girl.
Marie on Bastugatan Street.

341
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:19,670
I once met this hooker on Central Station.

342
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:22,650
I got her undressed and upon her bed.

343
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,620
When I should screw her,
she told me to go to sleep.

344
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:32,230
Then she grabbed a newspaper
and started reading the advertisements.

345
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:38,140
I was pissed, screwed her
and went home to sleep.

346
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,320
Listen to me!

347
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,900
I was waiting for the subway.
I was going to Stockholm from were we lived.

348
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:46,310
A girl came to me and said:

349
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,940
"You may if you want to", she said.

350
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,270
Well. What did you answer?

351
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,100
It was bright noon.
... Ouch, why are you pinching me?

352
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,680
Nobody is pinching anybody.

353
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,290
Yes, you did.

354
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:03,360
I could feel it.
You did like this.

355
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,070
Ouch, I cut myself!

356
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,460
I got a wound.

357
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,920
Why did you do that?

358
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,540
Why did you cut that poor boy.
He's done you no harm.

359
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,470
Let me have a look.

360
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,050
Did you do this?

361
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:20,860
- Do what?
- Jump on someone of your own size instead!

362
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,140
Stand up when I'm talking to you!

363
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,820
Nisse!

364
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,950
- Did you do this to him?
- No.

365
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:36,580
I don't have to ask.
I saw it with my own eyes,

366
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:39,130
but I demand an answer!

367
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:40,970
Well?

368
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,340
I know nothing.

369
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:44,340
You 'know nothing' of this?

370
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:48,470
Are you that disrespectful?
Do you deny it straight to my face?

371
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,390
Something that evident!

372
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,480
Deliberate sadism
is one of the most repulsive acts ever.

373
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,020
I saw it with my own eyes.

374
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,020
Answer me!

375
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,280
He might have been cut by this.
I was fiddling it.

376
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:02,990
- You pricked me with...
- Shut your mouth!

377
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:05,680
You do not order him
what to say or not.

378
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:06,490
He lies.

379
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,690
In this room there's only one liar.

380
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,380
Believe what you wish.

381
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,480
Watch your step, Nisse.

382
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:15,830
I will not tolerate this kind of behaviour.

383
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,100
What happened?

384
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:25,230
Bloody Nisse.
He cut Jingis' hand with a nail file.

385
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:30,210
This loony is totally brain-dead.
Lock him in for good!

386
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,150
«He understood nothing.»

387
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,690
«Nobody understood.»

388
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,250
How the hell can you sit here,
as a common laughing-stock.

389
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,140
You block-heads.

390
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,670
Don't you see he'll use
everything against you?

391
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,150
Do you think this survey
will last for ever?

392
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:21,270
Where will you end up
when this is over?

393
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:26,950
You'll go to Lövsta or Långanäs
or some other bloody reformatory where you belong.

394
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,100
The blame is yours.

395
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:35,010
They'll send you to some forestry
in the Lappish hell of a wilderness.

396
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:38,770
You know very well
where you'll end up.

397
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,660
"Sörsbro Mental Clinic"

398
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,660
To your comfort,
you'll be accompanied by Jingis.

399
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:53,210
Take good care of him...

400
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,160
to combine business with pleasure.

401
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,270
That damn queer.

402
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,980
- Do you think he is?
- What

403
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,740
- What you said.
- A queer?

404
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:08,640
Fucking, yes!
Do you mean we should...?

405
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,900
I don't know if it's possible.

406
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,770
But if...

407
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,440
We would do a lot better.

408
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:22,770
Lots of cash, fancy clothes and ...

409
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,880
But evidence?

410
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:28,280
Sneaking in with a camera,
taking some pics.

411
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,280
Who volunteers?

412
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,760
«Now we'll listen to Johan Fredrik Mellin Andersson...»

413
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:48,650
«born on 4th of February 1911.»

414
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:54,310
«on several occasions sentenced
to imprisonment with labour for theft.»

415
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,230
«Yes, reverend, my sins in life are many.»

416
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,530
«I was indeed a sinner.»

417
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,020
«But now Jesus is my whole life.»

418
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:05,990
«That's the plain truth.
Now, adultery and wickedness is history.»

419
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:10,000
«Well, it's long ago.
It was in summer 1977. I do remember.»

420
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,640
«I got six months.»

421
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:31,060
"I do long for the crown ..."

422
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:34,720
"... but I wonder some times ..."

423
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,700
"... will we have any ..."

424
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,810
Do come in.
You belong here too.

425
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,090
Enter.

426
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,100
"...heavenly ...

427
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:05,080
"... some good souls did I win for my God."

428
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:15,490
Thus even Jesus Christ
has made use of modern technology,

429
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,230
in the struggle against evilness.

430
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:23,160
This is a complicated device.
It's very expensive.

431
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,700
You must handle it with care,

432
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:28,940
not to let the delicate mechanism get ...

433
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:31,040
out of order.

434
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,140
«Once I was as simple-minded as Simon Peter,»

435
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,460
«when he asked his Teacher:»

436
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:43,190
«"Lord, what number of times
may my brother do wrong against me,
and I give him forgiveness?"»

437
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,280
«"Till seven times?"»

438
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:50,620
«But as Jesus taught Simon Peter...»

439
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,570
«He taught me at the same time, and said:»

440
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:59,490
«"I say not to you, Till seven times;
but, Till seventy times seven."»

441
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,530
«Seventy times seven ...»

442
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,940
«equals 490;»

443
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,150
«a high number and a big numeral.»

444
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:17,240
«490 times you can sin against Him...»

445
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,840
«and yet be forgiven.»

446
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,320
«You have His word because He loves you.»

447
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,890
But at the 491st ...

448
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:44,070
Then the devil will shake you,
and your bodies will tremble.

449
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,270
All your arrogance will be gone,

450
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:50,040
and you must pray for mercy.

451
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:57,850
Jesus Christ has promised
to forgive you 490 times,

452
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:01,470
whatever you have done...
because those were his words.

453
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:09,840
But about the 491st time ...

454
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,220
He has given no words.

455
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,960
None at all.

456
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,740
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

457
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,770
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

458
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:17,290
Well, thank you, I enjoyed meeting the boys
and deliver The Message.

459
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:20,420
- Once again, thank you.
- We owe you thanks, reverend.

460
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,370
What a bloody jerk.

461
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,100
How could Krister invite such an idiot?

462
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,980
"... some good souls did I win for my God."

463
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,430
«- I'll have one with sausage.
- Cheese.»

464
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,710
«Cut it out!»

465
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,190
«Well, get out and get a lay.»

466
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,470
«Sexually deprived, poor boy?»

467
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:09,290
«- That reverend.
- He's got himself a fat meal ticket.»

468
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,130
«He's not a greater saint than I am.»

469
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:20,070
If we get it on tape, it's water proof.

470
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,730
He hasn't got a chance.

471
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:24,710
We give him a copy, and he'll know.

472
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,890
What did you get that day?

473
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:32,050
Eh... eight Sedisonal...

474
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,110
... six "P" and some Efinol.

475
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:38,150
- I was a bit dizzy.
- Bullshit.

476
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,700
You begin to look old.

477
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,070
A bit bald.

478
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:45,160
Are you a beauty yourself?

479
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,230
- So you're out for hookers?
- Yes.

480
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,320
Show him how to do it.

481
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,800
Would the inspector like this?

482
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,490
Why not?
He's a member of the B-team.

483
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:11,230
This is his favourite tune.

484
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:14,900
- He's been "dancing" many times.
- Maybe into your butt as well?

485
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,520
No, but if they'll queue up,
I'll give a party.

486
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:19,790
What do I charge?

487
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,630
It'll be a difference
once you've married the inspector?

488
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,130
We'll have a party.

489
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:27,720
Hey, we arrange an engagement party.
Invite the inspector!

490
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,020
Can I borrow your paddle?

491
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:19,190
«And when I felt that the inspector
was ready to pick ... after a week,»

492
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,160
«I made Krister take us to the theatre.»

493
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:26,040
«"We need some culture", I said to him.»

494
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,600
«Krister was immediately carried away.»

495
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:40,430
«And the inspector was so moved,
that he promised to baby-sit ... yes, Pyret!»

496
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:44,420
- When do I get my ten?
- You will, but I have no money.

497
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:47,910
- You promised me my money.
- I know but I have no.

498
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:55,510
- What the hell!
- Get a paddle of your own.

499
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,100
- Won't you come, Pyret?
- Hell no.

500
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,780
You'll regret it.

501
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,000
Ready boys? Hurry!

502
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Stop playing.
Butcher!

503
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,510
In a second!

504
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,600
«Jingis. Have you taken a bath?»

505
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,270
Hurry Fish... Fish!

506
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,470
Hurry, please.

507
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,360
«It was the first time ever
I was at the theatre.»

508
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,570
«I didn't fancy it that much.»

509
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:56,080
«But I remember most of it.»

510
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,850
«It was the first time
for the others as well,»

511
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:03,330
«but for Jingis.
He had been at the opera as young boy.»

512
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,650
«He saw "Little Peter's Travel to the Moon".»

513
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,290
«This he shouted in the auditorium,
and made everyone stare at us.»

514
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:15,300
«They had already been staring at us,
so we felt a bit awkward.»

515
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:18,160
«Now to the play.»

Can men be deemed."»

519
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:38,230
«Everything was exaggerated, unnatural.
I got lost in it.»

520
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,850
«I was embarrassed
and fidgeted on my seat.»

521
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,920
«They waved their arms with trembling voices,
and strolled back and forth.»

522
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,490
«Nothing of it was for real.»

«and of course Krister.»

"The Objectivity
Juvenile Pension"

527
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,380
Was it a flop?

528
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,500
No. Why?

529
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,500
- You did it?
- What do you think?

530
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,500
Say it then!

531
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,900
- Witch is the Play button?
- This one.

532
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,040
Ah, now I know.

533
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,130
Turn it down!

534
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:38,170
- You're jackass of an engineer.
- It wasn't my idea.

535
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:41,960
We must do it again.

536
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:46,050
Count me out.
I didn't get a cent from that bloody queer!

537
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,750
- Wait.
- Who babbled? What now then?

538
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:01,250
Fuck you, you cannot kick me out
from my own quarters!

539
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,030
Open the door!

540
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,210
Open the door!

541
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,770
It belongs to the revered, doesn't it?

542
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,170
So it was you.

543
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:30,290
You gave me your word!

544
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:38,670
It's a fine device.

545
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,290
What were your plans?

546
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:48,210
Nisse, please.
Do me a great favour, return it.

547
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:50,340
As a favour person to person;

548
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:53,300
and for your own sake.

549
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:55,300
Do it tomorrow.

550
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:00,170
If I promise this will lead to no fuss.

551
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,630
If I promise that the police report
will be withdrawn;

552
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,540
that no one will blame you for anything.

00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:10,950
If nothing else;
for your own good.

554
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,980
Think it over.

555
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:23,080
If anything good will come out of this,
it must come from yourself.

You go!

558
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,220
Why me?

559
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:37,660
You're next in line.
You must do something on your own!

560
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,360
I won't hesitate.

561
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,550
Really?

562
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,900
Dare you join me?

Hello! Seize the thief!

Hello! Seize the thief!

565
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,110
Dammit that it had a report!

566
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,690
I never thought he had had the time.

567
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:58,280
That was really close!

568
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:00,550
All this for nothing.

You hell of a bastard, Krister.

00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:07,390
Pity you fear the inspector that much.

571
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:11,640
We have no proof.

572
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:14,800
Ask "him" and "he"
will raise and testify.

573
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,890
- And he would buy that?
- Yes, what?

574
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:24,780
- We cannot step up and just say "aha"?
- Not?

00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,780
- The inspector, is he here?
- Yes.

00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,510
It's Saturday; we close at one o'clock.

580
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:41,000
One of the boys from the Pension
wants a word with you, sir.

581
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:41,230
Let him in.

582
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:44,610
You may enter.

583
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:51,250
Ah, Nisse, do come in.
How nice to see you.

584

Everything in order?

585
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,730
Our dear Krister is doing all well.

586
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:59,730
Nothing but peace and quiet.

587
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:04,540
The survey works out quite well.
I've heard that you do really cooperate.

588
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:06,990
You have all shown maturity.

589
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:08,850
Be seated. Do sit.

590
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:13,910
You smoke, don't you.
Be my guest.

591
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:18,930
It can be a bit tiresome
in the long run.

592
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,080
But we will have to find
something out to ease it up,

593
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:25,810
since you downstairs
have all been so responsive.

594
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,460
Diligence must be rewarded.

595
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:33,250
This matter with Pyret.

596
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:37,960
So ... Anything particular on your mind?

597
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:42,370
He feels a bit downcast ...
at the moment.

598
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:44,180
So.

599
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:50,040
I thought you wished
to know about it, sir.

600
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:54,500
If you didn't know it already, sir.

601
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:58,450
Well ... why he's depressed, I mean.

602
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,380
Maybe you should express yourself
somewhat more precisely.

603
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:05,580
Did you make a bet?

604
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,970
It's about Pyret.

605
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:18,940
I think I fairly well can
figure out your point.

606
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:22,750
Sit.

607
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:34,820
It's all about what you had in mind
to get in exchange for your knowledge.

608
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,580
I only wanted you to know, sir.

609
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:41,700
Yes ... and now I know.

610
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:44,560
Anything else?

611
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:49,110
No, nothing, since you have already
promised us some benefits, sir.

612
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,110
Did I really make a promise?

613
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,130
Pity if I did,

614
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,880
since I in that case will have to break it.

615
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:59,420
Although I unwillingly do.

616
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,400
It would too easily be misinterpreted ...

617
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:05,070
as things have developed.

618
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:09,330
It's your decision, sir.

619
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:13,640
No ...
discipline would suffer from that,

620
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:16,920
and become a drawback
to our dear Krister.

621
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:29,090
I very unwillingly would take measures
that would harm him;

622
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:32,700
since he's so young
and inexperienced;

623
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:37,020
so inexperienced,
that he might not know ...

624
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:41,310
that a certain form of allegations
is a part of our profession;

625
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,700
far too common in fact.

626
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,440
He might misinterpret it ...

627
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:51,010
even if all the rest knows
about this phenomenon.

628
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,940
It would be a pity
to loose his friendship,

629
00:48:56,070 --> 00:49:00,340
due to what some
unbalanced boys claim...
but ...

630
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:04,540
Well ... This isn't exactly atypical.

631
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:07,250
We have all heard it before.

632
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:13,080
So nobody is interested in
what you claim to know.

633
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,000
Except in a psychological
point of view, that is.

634
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:21,020
Let me change the subject.

635
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:24,240
I heard something about a tape recorder ...

636
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:28,730
You might recall reverend Mild
visiting you an afternoon some days ago.

637
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:32,540
We have had an inquiry from the police.

638
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:35,300
We haven't yet decided our steps.

639
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:37,520
We've got a description.

640
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:41,530
This deals with notably
more evident matters.

641
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,590
Our dear Krister ...
also shares this opinion.

642
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:51,770
We have been discussing this.

643
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,820
There, cheer up!

644
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:00,860
It wasn't my meaning to daunt you,
being my visitor.

645
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,290
On the contrary!

646
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:06,320
I only mentioned it for you
to know of our support.

647
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:12,140
When you laid your hands
on that tape recorder,

648
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,540
you did a great job.

649
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:16,740
Nobody noticed anything.

650
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:18,960
But afterwards, Nisse ...

651
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:20,750
That was not like you.

652
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:23,040
You must have been daydreaming.

653
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:27,410
Well ... we'll straighten this out,
with the tape recorder I mean.

654
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:28,790
Cheer up!

655
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:34,880
Nothing has happened
that cannot be overruled.

656
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,690
You are a nice boy, by the way.

657
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,480
You are in fact fairly handsome.

658
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:47,640
A thin face and these gentle features.

659
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:50,980
Your mouth has a beautiful line.

660
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:54,740
But you should smile more often.

661
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:57,620
You mustn't be that suspicious, Nisse.

662
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:01,850
You must learn to take
what life has to give.

663
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:04,090
A great deal, I'd think.

664
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,660
I think many a person
would do quite a lot ...

665
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,850
to help you,
if only you'd care to take
what they will give.

666
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,050
You can go far in life.

667
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:18,940
There must be a great many
who would like to help a boy like you.

668
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,950
We have grown apart for some time.

669
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:33,800
Pity, we were really friends.

670
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,430
Maybe this is a great loss to us,

671
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:39,550
to both of us.

672
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:43,560
But there is still time, isn't there?

673
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,450
A fine neck you have.

674
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:57,540
Like a soft arc.

675
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,540
Here's a cleavage.

676
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,720
Soft and nicely shaped.

677
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:05,270
Here it meets with your hair.

678
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:09,210
But you're far too skinny, Nisse.

679
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:11,520
I can almost count your ribs.

680
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,250
Here's one ... another one ... another one.

681
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:34,340
This is beautiful, Nisse.

682
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:38,230
Nothing of this is dirty.

683
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:46,700
It is beautiful.

684
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,270
It is pure.

685
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:47,470
If you get something on your mind,
you're always welcome back.

686
00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:51,030
The door isn't locked.

687
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:45,970
«I couldn't get rid of it.»

688
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:49,890
«It came to my mind every dark night.»

689
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:54,340
«I tried to think of girls.»

690
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:57,070
«I choose pics from magazines.»

691
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:59,080
«"Pin-Up", "Cocktail" and others.»

692
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:03,490
«I chose among pics I had used»

693
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:05,440
«when I ... wanked.»

694
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:07,490
«Yes, I did.»

695
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:17,390
«I picked Kajsa at The Objectivity,
the dame with the breasts.»

696
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:21,770
«I removed her bra and almost
fondled her to death every evening.»

697
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,240
«But the inspector always interfered.»

698
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:36,140
«When I was thinking of Kajsa,
his head came in between and was poking around.»

699
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:38,970
«My nausea for it didn't help.»

700
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,260
«It was the other way round.»

701
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:16,520
Wouldn't you tell me
what has happened?

702
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,620
Did something happen?

703
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,930
I don't know.
You look troubled.

704
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:28,670
Did I hurt your feelings some way
without seeing it myself?

705
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:33,600
Wouldn't you tell me,
to prevent me from doing it a second time?

706
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:44,300
You had confidence in me before ...
at first.

707
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:47,060
... I think.

708
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:54,010
If you've done something
you fear I will report, then ...

709
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:55,690
Wouldn't you?

710
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,430
You mean ... to the inspector?

711
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:02,080
You shouldn't misjudge him, Nisse.

712
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:05,220
- He's saved your backs more than you might believe.
- He has?

713
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,950
You have to admit that?

714
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:12,130
Well, you shouldn't never poke
in old wounds, but...

715
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:14,910
This tape recorder.

716
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:22,450
You must admit he's the one
who got you out of it.

717
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,570
I mean ...
I too was under pressure,

718
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:28,460
since you'd promised to return it.

719
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:31,960
Well, I don't blame you, Nisse.

720
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:35,500
If the inspector had not interfered, so ...

721
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:42,510
I really shouldn't say this.
It was meant as a surprise.

722
00:57:42,890 --> 00:57:45,640
You'll get new furniture
for the lounge next week.

723
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,020
A new radio-gramophone,

724
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:49,090
with an inbuilt tape recorder.

725
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,670
He's the mind behind that.

726
00:57:51,950 --> 00:57:56,760
- I even think he's made a private contribution.
- I don't give a damn!

727
00:59:10,730 --> 00:59:13,590
You rotten bastard!
Lifting Krister's books.

728
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:16,940
What did you get?

729
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:19,140
- 155.
- Give it me!

730
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:31,480
This'll be a starting fund.
Now we'll do real business.

731
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:34,270
Brännvin, booze!
We smuggle it and sell it.

732
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:36,930
We buy it for 15
and sell it for 30.

733
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,540
Not from a Svea ship.

734
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:48,250
They charge too much.
And they drink it all themselves.

735
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:51,970
Not really stylish;
smugglers on shitty bikes!

736
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:54,180
We should be
at the amusement park instead.

737
00:59:54,330 --> 00:59:57,440
You could have a lot of fun for 140 bucks.

738
00:59:57,830 --> 00:59:58,780
155!

739
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:01,900
140!
That bastard invested in a new hat.

740
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,980
Hesitating are we?
When things are getting serious?

741
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:07,510
Okey, back out! I don't mind.
Go and socialize.

742
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:09,880
I'll do fine on my own.

743
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:19,940
«Who's there?»

744
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:24,720
Excuse me.

745
01:01:24,830 --> 01:01:26,780
Speak to them.
Say what we're after.

746
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:27,700
I do.

747
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:29,700
'Excuse me', is that German?

748
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:31,950
«No, I spilt it out.»

749
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:33,950
We want to buy Brännvin.

750
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:35,950
Twenty crowns a bottle.

751
01:01:35,950 --> 01:01:37,950
Then you can have it.

752
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:39,580
Fifteen,

753
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:41,580
and ten bottles.

754
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:42,800
Eighteen.

755
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:45,540
They have got a chick.
No, look...!

756
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:48,620
- Move and let me see. Move!
- Don't push!

757
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:51,530
Look, they're fucking her!

758
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:55,440
Sixteen is we ...

759
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,580
I mean our highest bid.
No higher.

760
01:01:57,670 --> 01:01:59,440
«Then beat it and close the door.»

761
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:02,840
Hell, let's enter.
They are so pissed up, they won't notice.

762
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,100
Be grateful for that.

763
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:12,720
Want some?

764
01:02:14,410 --> 01:02:15,470
Me too.

765
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:17,480
Not you.
You're too young.

766
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:19,650
«Those scumbags made me pregnant!»

767
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:22,810
If it's a baby-chick,
name her after the ship.

768
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:27,020
I told you to get out!

769
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:30,380
- They could at least stop this.
- I pity her.

770
01:02:30,430 --> 01:02:34,450
She's hurt.
Could she get some schnaps ... please.

771
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:40,090
Feeling better, are we?

772
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:42,190
Talk about the Brännvin.
What's his price?

773
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:44,470
Sixteen crowns and fifty öre.

774
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:46,710
Yuk, now she's vomiting!

775
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:04,740
You have no clothes on.

776
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:13,380
Come on.
You want it yourself.

777
01:03:25,310 --> 01:03:26,810
Come on!

778
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:15,040
Not good!

779
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:17,100
But she wanted to.

780
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:22,770
What did he say?

781
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:26,390
He said it was no pleasure,
since she was too willing.

782
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:31,250
Eighteen.

783
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:33,250
"Achtzehn" what does that mean?

784
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:35,060
'Eighteen' isn't it?

785
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:38,840
Eighteen!
The bid was sixteen fifty a minute ago.

786
01:04:39,010 --> 01:04:40,840
You can't keep on bargain
like an old hag.

787
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:44,280
We'll get that difference back
when we sell the bottles.

788
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:45,480
How many can we get?

789
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:47,370
Seven. 126 crowns.

790
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,380
Fine, that'll leave us some change.

791
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:51,140
Seven.

792
01:05:05,710 --> 01:05:07,950
We'd better check the bottles.
They might have been opened.

793
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:09,680
You cannot do that!

794
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:11,680
They are buddies.

795
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:15,690
Take the bottles and leave.
I'll join you after I've fixed something.

796
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:28,740
- See anybody?
- No.

797
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:30,740
- Let's go on shore.
- Yes.

798
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:36,880
- Where's Egon?
- He should talk himself to that babe.

799
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:53,650
What the fuck, are you all sleeping?

800
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:55,610
Nisse, wake up.

801
01:05:55,770 --> 01:05:59,270
A rotten style, Jingis.
Sleeping all morning.

802
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:02,000
- Is this your quarters?
- Yep.

803
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,970
In the upper bunk,
but let's eat first.

804
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:07,780
Guys, bloody wake up!

805
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:10,230
Open a bottle and let's have a draft.

806
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:13,370
Taste it and see for yourself.

807
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:50,330
- Do they bunk here as well?
- Yes. Have a sip.

808
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:58,100
- Cut that out will you!
- But it's plain water.

809
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:39,600
Wait ... be careful.

810
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:42,590
The same as in our glasses.

811
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:38,790
«At that time, Ray arrived.»

812
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:42,970
«That he was named Ray,
we had to find out in the newspapers.»

813
01:08:43,330 --> 01:08:45,580
«But he never tried to leave us behind,»

814
01:08:45,670 --> 01:08:48,180
«as he left the night watch, that is.»

815
01:08:49,590 --> 01:08:52,790
«At the beginning we hanged out
in Gärdet and in Djurgården,»

816
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:55,750
«because I used to live there as a boy.»

817
01:08:56,380 --> 01:08:59,730
«I had never been there since,
and I got this certain feeling.»

818
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,850
«I had never had a dog before.»

819
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:14,510
«Sometimes we lit a fire
and cooked something to eat.»

820
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:16,980
«Ray got his fair share.»

821
01:09:21,230 --> 01:09:24,030
«Afterwards ... when we were grabbed,»

822
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:27,450
«I was said to have mistreated him.
But that's a lie.»

823
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:32,040
«Okay, we might not have been
grooming him that very often.»

824
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:37,000
«We roamed the city all through.»

825
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:39,330
«We tried to bathe once,»

826
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,610
«not far from Viggbyholm,
but it was too cold.»

827
01:09:45,650 --> 01:09:48,040
«We visited Kallhäll and Norrviken.»

828
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:50,720
«We were gone all day long.»

829
01:09:50,970 --> 01:09:52,830
«The Pension was for sleeping only.»

830
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:55,040
«We didn't give a damn
about the survey.»

831
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:57,490
«Of course they were confused.»

832
01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:03,380
«Dogfood isn't that cheap.
We were short of money;»

833
01:10:04,030 --> 01:10:06,050
«our pocket money I mean.»

834
01:10:07,210 --> 01:10:09,940
«So I kept on stealing books from Krister.»

835
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:21,230
Excuse me, Nisse.

836
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:23,610
I cannot allow you
to empty my entire library,

837
01:10:23,610 --> 01:10:26,210
without knowing
where it all ends up.

838
01:10:26,290 --> 01:10:28,420
Sold.
You can call the cops.

839
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:31,170
- You very well know I cannot.
- Why?

840
01:10:31,650 --> 01:10:32,900
I can do it for you.

841
01:10:32,990 --> 01:10:33,720
Don't be daft!

842
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:37,240
If you're able to lurk in here,
you're able to call the cops as well.

843
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:45,160
Where's the dog?

844
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:46,200
Where does he fit in?

845
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,210
Is he stolen?

846
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:48,430
So what?
Is he unhappy?

847
01:10:48,430 --> 01:10:51,000
No, but his owner might miss him.
He's paid for him.

848
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,640
Let's buy him then!

849
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,920
And the ethic aspect?

850
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:07,120
That's Ray.

851
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:16,180
And Steva?

852
01:11:17,030 --> 01:11:19,590
Won't you speak
to the inspector about her too?

853
01:11:20,670 --> 01:11:23,130
Maybe you're unaware
that she's living here?

854
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:27,450
Anything else?

855
01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:31,000
Almost all my books.

856
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:33,820
- So.
- I have a need for some of them.

857
01:11:45,490 --> 01:11:47,890
Something has gone astray.

858
01:11:48,790 --> 01:11:50,730
I cannot pinpoint it.

859
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:55,580
And obviously I'm not given
an opportunity to make good.

860
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,580
Come here ... come.

861
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:16,070
Come. You can have me.

862
01:12:16,990 --> 01:12:18,620
I want you.

863
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:23,660
Look at me.

864
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,570
Look at me!

865
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:40,850
Afraid of Egon?

866
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:44,230
Take no notice of him.

867
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:46,210
I dumped him.

868
01:12:49,290 --> 01:12:52,090
And he won't be back
for an hour, by the way.

869
01:12:58,090 --> 01:12:59,210
Deceived!

870
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:02,030
Did you really believe
you could have me?

871
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:06,340
I wouldn't touch you
with a barge pole!

872
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:21,330
Oh Ray ... Come here boy.

873
01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:32,140
You may it you want.

874
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:35,160
No idea.

875
01:13:36,410 --> 01:13:39,430
As you wish.
I don't care.

876
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:47,200
«Krister was my sole target.»

877
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:49,530
«I calculated his weak spots.»

878
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:52,650
«My mind was not really focused on her.»

879
01:13:56,210 --> 01:13:58,890
«My plans for Krister
turned out just fine.»

880
01:13:59,510 --> 01:14:02,050
«Everything went according to my plans.»

881
01:15:03,230 --> 01:15:04,610
We didn't do this.

882
01:15:04,670 --> 01:15:05,750
We didn't do this.

883
01:15:05,790 --> 01:15:07,750
We would tell you
if we knew where he'd gone.

884
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,750
We couldn't stop him.

885
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:11,750
We can help you to search for it.

886
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:14,400
To prove we didn't do this,
we'll help you.

887
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:19,430
Where is it all?

888
01:16:19,690 --> 01:16:21,060
- Where?
- Yes.

889
01:16:22,550 --> 01:16:23,890
I sold it.

890
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,170
You sold it?

891
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:39,620
And of course
I am the one to blame,

892
01:16:40,610 --> 01:16:42,680
though I don't know why.

893
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:49,010
Maybe you think
I'm having false pretensions.

894
01:16:52,930 --> 01:16:55,650
At first I had in mind
to become a biologist.

895
01:16:57,630 --> 01:17:00,960
I cannot recall
what made me study people,

896
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:03,570
if you don't mind me saying so.

897
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:13,630
Where's the money?

898
01:17:16,510 --> 01:17:17,790
You cannot have spent it all?

899
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:20,070
What I got for the grand piano
is in the postal bank.

900
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:22,000
On what bank account?

901
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:26,360
Nine, zero ... , zero, zero, six, two.

902
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:29,660
Who's account is that?

903
01:17:31,370 --> 01:17:33,440
The fund raise for the leprous.

904
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,850
The leprous ...

905
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:44,290
Where is the great piano?

906
01:17:44,350 --> 01:17:46,040
At a piano shop.

907
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:48,250
The furniture?

908
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:50,270
At a buyer's.

909
01:17:51,590 --> 01:17:54,780
If I can get that money,
will you show me?
I want it back.

910
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:58,260
- You don't have that money.
- I must have it all back!

911
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:03,430
Well, if you meet me early Monday morning,
with the money.

912
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:01,930
Honestly, do you have the money?

913
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:04,740
Search me if you wish.

914
01:19:05,190 --> 01:19:07,770
Bloody hell.
Leave my pockets alone!

915
01:19:11,270 --> 01:19:13,260
I've made phone calls
to everyone I know.

916
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:18,490
I'm short of 470 crowns .

917
01:19:19,810 --> 01:19:22,350
There is a person
who might help you.

918
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:24,630
Who?

919
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:29,190
- No ... that would be improper.
- No, tell me. Who?

920
01:19:31,290 --> 01:19:35,020
- No, I've changed my mind.
- Don't you trust me to pay him back?

921
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:37,780
- That's not the cause.
- What then?

922
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:41,590
Do you think he'll refuse?

923
01:19:44,290 --> 01:19:45,920
'She' rather.

924
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:59,140
Does she have that money?

925
01:20:00,090 --> 01:20:01,540
Ask her.

926
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:05,630
Wouldn't she find it odd, if I ...?

927
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:07,830
You ask her.

928
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,240
I don't need any money.

929
01:20:19,710 --> 01:20:21,740
This fella has something to say.

930
01:20:24,030 --> 01:20:26,170
She must think it's odd that I ...

931
01:20:26,730 --> 01:20:28,650
She might misunderstand.

932
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:35,770
Please, Nisse, you ask her.

933
01:20:37,850 --> 01:20:39,070
He needs money.

934
01:20:39,140 --> 01:20:40,950
470 crowns.

935
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:43,580
Tell her why. What for.

936
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:48,010
To buy back his furniture
I stole from him.

937
01:20:49,070 --> 01:20:52,540
- Can you get it for him?
- Tell her I will of course pay her back.

938
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:56,020
If you accompany me.

939
01:21:00,470 --> 01:21:01,740
Is she in favour?

940
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:08,870
«He understood nothing.»

941
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:12,610
«We took a taxi from the Central Station.»

942
01:21:13,150 --> 01:21:16,530
«Steva said we'd only stick to persons in cars.
Easier that way.»

943
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:19,800
«A great deal of car going that night.»

944
01:21:20,850 --> 01:21:23,080
«First I bought her a bottle
at Norrmalm's Square;»

945
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:25,510
«for 25 crowns .. that I had to pay;»

946
01:21:26,910 --> 01:21:28,830
«or should I say, Krister.»

947
01:21:30,290 --> 01:21:32,160
«To provide Steva with customers was easy.»

948
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:34,190
«They swarmed like flies around her.»

949
01:21:34,530 --> 01:21:36,430
«She could be choosy.»

950
01:21:55,830 --> 01:21:57,790
«We were at Djurgården twice.»

951
01:21:57,890 --> 01:21:59,610
«once at Lill-Jansskogen, »

952
01:21:59,770 --> 01:22:01,000
«next to the gasometer»

953
01:22:01,130 --> 01:22:03,330
«I saw her through the rear window.»

954
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,860
«Then once at the Engelbrekt Church.»

955
01:22:08,220 --> 01:22:11,540
«She did it twice in the car.
Then I had to step outside.»

956
01:22:12,490 --> 01:22:16,380
«She told them I'd let the dog loose,
if they tried to cheat her.»

957
01:22:18,050 --> 01:22:20,010
«I once made use of you, Ray.»

958
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:23,260
«When a queer turned up
and insinuated that I ...»

959
01:22:24,010 --> 01:22:26,320
«When I returned with you, he ran off.»

960
01:22:29,650 --> 01:22:31,630
«We took a taxi downtown.»

961
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:33,580
«It was already light.»

962
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:36,180
«All the doves were cooing.»

963
01:23:05,590 --> 01:23:07,920
Dammit, my back is aching.

964
01:23:15,810 --> 01:23:18,310
If you want me to go upstairs,
you'll have to carry me.

965
01:23:19,290 --> 01:23:21,090
And this bloody dog.

966
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:23,130
He should be put to death!

967
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:27,350
Carry me!

968
01:23:46,690 --> 01:23:49,250
No bloody pimp must ever kick me!

969
01:23:50,830 --> 01:23:53,530
Give me my money,
that I have earned.

970
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:14,020
The Money!
Shall we leave it there?

971
01:24:14,110 --> 01:24:15,810
You said it's yours.

972
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:17,960
I won't pick it up.

973
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:23,740
Pick it up!

974
01:24:47,690 --> 01:24:49,260
How much is it?

975
01:24:50,290 --> 01:24:51,970
490.

976
01:25:18,910 --> 01:25:20,620
Check her bag.

977
01:25:32,050 --> 01:25:33,850
Not a penny!

978
01:25:35,850 --> 01:25:38,250
What'll Krister say about this?

979
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:41,460
Krister!
He's the one to have the money.

980
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:43,660
I know another funny story,
about Bellman.

981
01:25:43,770 --> 01:25:47,580
Ask him!
Come, let's go ask him.

982
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:56,810
Do you know what time it is?

983
01:25:56,990 --> 01:26:00,000
You cannot be so drunk
that you've forget all about time.

984
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:03,240
Join us.
We'll deliver the money now.

985
01:26:30,030 --> 01:26:31,630
You needed money.

986
01:26:50,670 --> 01:26:52,030
There is 20 crowns too much.

987
01:26:52,150 --> 01:26:54,500
Give it to Steva.
She's fixed them for you.

988
01:26:56,070 --> 01:26:58,050
I don't know how to thank you.
I ...

989
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:01,390
I never thought this of you, Krister.
So that's your dark side.

990
01:27:02,340 --> 01:27:04,360
Will you turn the whole Pension
into a brothel?

991
01:27:04,540 --> 01:27:06,250
Steva is just a start.

992
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:07,490
And Nisse.

993
01:27:07,510 --> 01:27:10,380
Because he sold your old furniture,
he too must work for you.

994
01:27:15,470 --> 01:27:17,370
You was only thinking
of the furniture.

995
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:20,400
Your sole concern
was the furniture.

996
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:24,920
You might think that I will consent
to let my doll work in the streets for you.

997
01:27:25,030 --> 01:27:26,070
You bloody pimp!

998
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:28,930
What's the big deal?
I'll get the money back.

999
01:27:29,070 --> 01:27:30,930
I know another funny story,
about Bellman.

1000
01:27:31,110 --> 01:27:32,990
Get it back!
Dreamer!

1001
01:27:33,140 --> 01:27:35,630
You'll never have a penny.
On the contrary!

1002
01:27:35,700 --> 01:27:37,480
You nit-wit!

1003
01:27:37,670 --> 01:27:38,940
Had I only known.

1004
01:27:39,050 --> 01:27:40,760
What about me?

1005
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:45,540
I cannot accept it.

1006
01:27:45,930 --> 01:27:47,770
I'm sorry, but I cannot.

1007
01:27:47,940 --> 01:27:49,750
What do you mean 'sorry'?

1008
01:27:49,830 --> 01:27:51,830
How about some gratitude?

1009
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:56,310
I had a hell of a time getting it,
and now, nobody wants it.

1010
01:27:56,430 --> 01:27:58,260
Do you think I'll accept bribes?

1011
01:28:00,630 --> 01:28:02,660
This is so yucky
it makes me puke.

1012
01:28:03,460 --> 01:28:05,630
And afterwards
I don't even get a 'thank you'.

1013
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:08,670
On the contrary.
So, the whole thing was in vain.

1014
01:28:08,990 --> 01:28:12,470
If you think you can get out of this,
you are so wrong.
I'll call the police!

1015
01:28:19,290 --> 01:28:22,280
I must thank you for the lesson
you've given me, Nisse.

1016
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:26,900
I realize I don't know
that much about myself ...

1017
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:30,350
or about life.

1018
01:28:33,110 --> 01:28:36,060
I had no idea
that I had these depths inside of me.

1019
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:42,100
You have opened my eyes.
You earn the credit for that.

1020
01:28:43,530 --> 01:28:45,400
So, I want to thank you.

1021
01:28:45,950 --> 01:28:48,480
Hell.
So you'll start to whine.

1022
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:50,550
What cause do you have to whine?

1023
01:28:50,690 --> 01:28:53,120
And I?
What should I do?

1024
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:08,440
«- What time is it?
- Almost five o'clock a.m.»

1025
01:29:08,770 --> 01:29:10,760
«No use going to bed.»

1026
01:29:13,410 --> 01:29:15,690
Do you think Egon went to the cops?

1027
01:29:16,390 --> 01:29:18,210
Where's Krister?

1028
01:29:18,670 --> 01:29:20,470
That bloody guy.

1029
01:29:20,650 --> 01:29:22,910
I tried to help that pig.

1030
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:24,400
Idiot!

1031
01:29:25,230 --> 01:29:27,200
You started it all,
by the way.

1032
01:29:27,340 --> 01:29:31,360
- Would you stop spilling the Brännvin!
- You cannot master me.

1033
01:29:31,670 --> 01:29:33,940
Buy your own booze
if you fancy it.

1034
01:29:35,020 --> 01:29:36,550
Sunday morning.

1035
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:43,190
- You bloody whore.
- Bog off, wanker!

1036
01:29:43,330 --> 01:29:45,290
You bloody would if I'd let you!

1037
01:29:45,660 --> 01:29:48,390
Ray. There boy, come to me.

1038
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:56,130
I would prefer you, Ray.

1039
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:58,700
Do it, Ray.
It's for free!

1040
01:29:58,730 --> 01:29:59,500
Not for you.

1041
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:01,460
What I want I take.

1042
01:30:01,590 --> 01:30:05,680
Do that! Do rape me!
You are all the same.

1043
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:07,680
Stop shouting!

1044
01:30:09,310 --> 01:30:11,210
I'd better undress right away.

1045
01:30:11,450 --> 01:30:14,350
I want it too. It's my Brännvin.
Give it me!

1046
01:30:14,540 --> 01:30:18,330
- Give her a draught.
- Isn't she drunk enough already?

1047
01:30:19,090 --> 01:30:21,410
If you'll screw me
I'll have to be drunk first.

1048
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:25,170
«That's enough.
Fish, relieve her from the bottle!»

1049
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,860
«So, my little boys are shy?»

1050
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:34,560
«I can wake the other boys up
to increase your number.»

1051
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:36,890
«Then you might be less shy.»

1052
01:30:38,750 --> 01:30:40,200
«I don't care.»

1053
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:43,570
One more or less is of no importance.

1054
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:46,050
Not when little boys are fiddling me.

1055
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:48,330
I don't feel it anyhow.

1056
01:30:49,670 --> 01:30:52,290
I'll never notice
if you are there or not.

1057
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:58,260
But I demand a bed.
Remember that!

1058
01:30:58,420 --> 01:31:00,040
And a mattress.

1059
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:02,910
I'm so dead tired
of laying on the ground!

1060
01:31:04,230 --> 01:31:06,350
No way that Egon will call the cops.

1061
01:31:08,550 --> 01:31:10,050
Do you think he will?

1062
01:31:10,170 --> 01:31:11,980
Well, are you fit for it?

1063
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,540
Do you think you're capable?

1064
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:26,160
Here's nothing to be found.

1065
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:28,720
Pyret, get the tweezers.

1066
01:31:30,230 --> 01:31:31,520
Yes you hit!

1067
01:31:31,610 --> 01:31:35,770
Fine, you bloody sadist!
You're capable, when you can beat a naked girl?

1068
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:50,810
Is this all you can do?

1069
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:56,070
- That's a bloody sewer you've got.
- But it still makes you darn horny!

1070
01:31:56,190 --> 01:31:58,350
Don't spill your chances.

1071
01:31:59,190 --> 01:32:01,180
Pyret, go and get a bed.

1072
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:02,640
But remove the mattress.

1073
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:04,630
Ray, come here boy!

1074
01:32:16,530 --> 01:32:18,060
What's the matter?

1075
01:32:48,350 --> 01:32:50,490
Come here, Ray.
Come.

1076
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:54,420
- I don't know how he ...
- Then show him.

1077
01:33:42,140 --> 01:33:44,740
«She had to pay the whole bill.»

1078
01:33:45,570 --> 01:33:49,500
«She had to pay for what she did to Krister ...
and for what I did to him.»

1079
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:53,890
«She had to pay for my bad sides
and for Krister's bad sides.»

1080
01:33:55,170 --> 01:33:58,210
«And all of it was entangled
and simultaneous.»

1081
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:00,850
Leave us alone!

1082
01:34:01,540 --> 01:34:02,820
Who was that?

1083
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:04,160
Was it Jingis?

1084
01:34:04,660 --> 01:34:06,410
Don't come closer!

1085
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:08,360
You'd better get dressed.

1086
01:34:09,580 --> 01:34:10,870
They are here.

1087
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:16,900
Now you'll get nailed.
You'll have to deliver some answers.

1088
01:34:18,070 --> 01:34:20,040
Serves you right, you piece of shit.

1089
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:40,650
No, wrong guys.

1090
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:03,220
That's the guy;
in the bed.

1091
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:07,460
Leave me alone.
Let me sleep.

1092
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:10,860
Who are you?

1093
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:14,380
Have a guess.
Do they look like charity nurses?

1094
01:35:14,510 --> 01:35:17,560
This boy have produced
severe accusations against you.

1095
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:20,000
We are obliged
to make an investigation.

1096
01:35:20,170 --> 01:35:22,000
She earned 500 crowns to him.

1097
01:35:22,170 --> 01:35:23,890
490.

1098
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:27,440
What difference does it make
in this situation?

1099
01:35:28,820 --> 01:35:30,910
I accompanied her
when she made the money.

1100
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:32,070
She felt lonely.

1101
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:32,990
See!

1102
01:35:33,090 --> 01:35:34,580
I told you.

1103
01:35:37,270 --> 01:35:39,110
You cannot do this, Nisse.

1104
01:35:39,750 --> 01:35:41,040
You cannot.

1105
01:35:42,230 --> 01:35:43,440
You wreck for everyone.

1106
01:35:43,540 --> 01:35:46,300
Don't worry, Krister.
I'll help you!

1107
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:50,790
