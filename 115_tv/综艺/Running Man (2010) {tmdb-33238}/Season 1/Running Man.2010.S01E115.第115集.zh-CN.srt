00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:12,296
# 我们一起面对命运 #
We face the music together 

# 堵上我们的一切 #
And throw our hats in the ring 

# 面对各种天气 #
Facing all kinds of weather 

# 无所畏惧 #
And not afraid of anything 

# 当太阳升起时 我们会在路上 #
When the sun comes up, we'll be on our way

# 我们不在乎目的地 #
And we don't care where we land 

# 不管浪有多高 #
And the waves are high,

2
00:00:12,297 --> 00:00:14,011
# 但我们不回头 #
but we won't turn round 

# 因为我们手牵手 #
'Cause your hand is in my hand 

# 并且 哦-哦 #
And, oh-oh 

# 你让我感到无人能敌 #
You make me feel invincible 

# 因为是你与我一起 #
'Cause it's you and me 

# 穿过风浪 #
Through the wind and hail 

# 向世界起航 #
Setting sail into the world.

00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:10,988
好的 天啊 今天真的很棒
Okay. Oh, gosh. This was great.

你想亲我一下告别吗 就现在
Do you want to kiss me good-bye, here, now?

4
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:15,906
好啊
Um, yes.

5
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:17,621
我 我以为我要把你送回门口呢
I-I was gonna walk you to your door.

6
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:20,001
- 哦 - 你不是就住在前面街角吗
- Oh. - 'Cause you live on the corner, right?

7
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:22,209
是啊 但是没事的 你不用的
Yeah, but that's okay. You don't even have to.

8
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,079
在这里就行
You could just do it here.

9
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:26,126
为什么 你爸爸在外面
Why? What... what, is your dad waiting outside

10
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,710
- 拿着猎枪等着你吗 - 差不多吧
- with a shotgun or something? - Oh, kind of.

11
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:29,916
什么
What?

12
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:32,885
不是的
No.

13
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:34,597
不是 是...
No. It's, uh...

14
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:36,347
- 是 古泽敏 - 啊
- It's Guzmin. - Ah.

15
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:37,598
嗯 他从阿尔巴尼亚来的
Yeah, he's from Albania.

16
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,159
- 你懂的 他在劳动营长大的 - 嗯
- You know, he grew up in a labor camp. - Right.

17
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:40,911
- 他的父母曾经是政治激进分子 - 哦
- His parents were political activists. - Oh.

18
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:42,975
- 他们在他小时候就被逮捕了 - 真惨
- They were arrested when he was a kid. - Shit.

19
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,998
好吧 我... 我感觉你没当回事
You know, I... I feel like you're not taking this seriously.

20
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:47,272
古泽敏到底是谁
Who the hell is Guzmin?

21
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:52,404
那就是古泽敏
That is Guzmin.

22
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,571
你的门卫吗
Your doorman?

23
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,946
不 他不仅仅是门卫
No, he's more than a doorman.

24
00:01:57,993 --> 00:01:59,583
这 这很难解释
It's-it's very hard to explain.

25
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,370
他成为了我的...
He's become a...

26
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:03,043
该死
Oh, shit.

27
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:07,091
天啊 不要
Oh, my God, no.

28
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,917
- 别这样 不 - 为什么不行
- Don't do that, no. - Why not?

29
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:11,383
- 拜托 - 不
- Come on. - No.

30
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:14,393
我... 最好不要
I... I wouldn't do that.

31
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:16,947
他怎么想对你很重要吗
Is it important to you what he thinks?

32
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:18,365
不 天啊 当然不了
No. Oh, my God, no.

33
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:19,769
不 我是个独立的女人
No, I'm an independent woman,

34
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:22,557
我不需要任何人帮我做决定
and I don't need anyone to help me make up my mind.

35
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,231
好吧
Okay.

36
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,105
好了 我得走了
All right, I better go.

37
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,360
- 什么 - 嗯
- What? - Yeah.

38
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:34,363
你的出租来了
Here's your taxi.

39
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:36,985
- 走吧 - 什么...
- Let's go. - What? Wha...

40
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,170
我今晚很高兴
I had a really great time tonight.

41
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,717
你愿意再来一次吗
Um, do you want to do this again?

42
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,139
当然了 我...
Yes, I...

43
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,155
- 嗯 - 我是说 我今天和你聊的很愉快
- Yeah. - I mean, I loved talking to you this evening.

44
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,349
我明晚有空
I'm free tomorrow night.

45
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,139
我给你打电话 - 好
I'll call you. - Okay.

46
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,320
晚安 古泽敏
Good night, Guzmin.

47
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:12,026
那是谁
Who was this?

48
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,937
那是马克
That was Mark.

49
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:15,356
我不喜欢他
I did not like him.

50
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:17,364
省省吧
Save it.

51
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,066
他不是你的类型
He is not for you.

52
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,076
他很弱还没有自制力
He is a weak man with no self control.

53
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,718
你在三十尺外怎么知道的
How can you tell that from 30 feet away?

54
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:25,751
你通过狙击枪的瞄准镜能了解一个人的很多事
You learn a lot about a man through the scope of a sniper rifle.

55
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,335
- 他不会给你打电话的 - 会的
- He will not be calling you. - Oh, yeah.

56
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,297
他绝对会的
He absolutely will be calling me.

57
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:34,968
永远 他永远不会给你打电话的
Ever. He will never be calling you.

58
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:37,797
天啊 我今晚看起来多美啊
God, I looked so good tonight, okay?

59
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:40,513
我很幽默 我很有才情
I was so funny. I was scintillating.

60
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,514
我喷了我的无花果香水
I wore my fig perfume,

61
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,386
据说让人难以拒绝
which is apparently impossible to resist.

62
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:48,654
那你... 你想打赌吗
I mean, do you... do you want to bet?

63
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,357
我不会打百分百会赢的赌的
I cannot bet on a certainty.

64
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,397
这不符合我的原则
It is against my principles.

65
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,781
晚安 米歇尔小姐
Good night, Miss Mitchell.

66
00:04:00,476 --> 00:04:01,657
不 不 不 不 不
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

67
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:30,847
感到很性奋 我感到很性奋
Feeling frisky. I'm feeling frisky.

68
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,901
好的
Okay.

69
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:41,657
他不会给你打电话的
He will not be calling you.

70
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:47,329
他永远不会给你打电话的
He will never be calling you.

71
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,419
去你的
Fuck you.

72
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,732
有马克的消息吗
Any news from Mark?

73
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:15,771
没 没有 我没看 我不知道...
No. No, I haven't even checked. I don't...

74
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,316
这不是我人生的全部
It's not my whole life.

75
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,740
- 祝你愉快 米歇尔小姐 - 你也是
- Have a good day, Miss Mitchell. - Yep. You, too.

76
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,711
该死的 古泽敏 算你厉害
Damn it, Guzmin. You're good.

77
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:31,747
所以 你的工作是评论书籍
So, you review books for a living,

78
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,720
然后你和一个门卫住在一栋楼里吗
and you live in a building with a doorman?

79
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:50,975
是啊 那个公寓很多年了一直是我们家的
Yes. The apartment has been in my family for years,

80
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,898
所以房租也一直是八十年代的水准
so the rent is stuck in the '80s.

81
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,646
加上我读书很快
Plus I'm a really fast reader.

82
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,818
所以你一周读多少书
So how many books can you read in a week?

83
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,227
有时一天一本
Oh, sometimes I read one a day.

84
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,025
- 什么 - 是啊
- What? - Yeah.

85
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:02,859
所以这让你 十分聪明吗
So does that make you, like, really bright?

86
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:06,575
不 我只是知道很多事实而已
No. I just know a lot of facts.

87
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:09,237
我就像有脚的百科全书
I'm like a Wikipedia page with legs.

88
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:13,076
好吧 我一年一本就不错了
Yeah, well, I'm lucky if I read one a year.

89
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,753
抱歉
Sorry.

90
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:20,167
嗯 但是... 你很帅
Yeah, but... you're good-looking.

91
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,927
总不能两者兼顾吧
I can't have both, right?

92
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,547
既聪明又帅
Smart and so good-looking.

93
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,425
- 好吧 - 又不是童话
- Yeah, okay. - It's not a fairy tale.

94
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:38,484
谢谢你送我回家
Thank you for seeing me home.

95
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:40,694
不客气
You're very welcome.

96
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,071
我喜欢这样
Oh, I like that.

97
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:45,863
- 是吗 - 嗯
- Yeah? - Yeah.

98
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,290
所以 这是去你家或者去我家的时刻吗
So, is this a "Your place or mine" Moment?

99
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,382
怎么了
What's up?

100
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:08,297
这样吧 来我家
You know what? Mine.

101
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,555
真的吗
Yeah?

102
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,596
真的 去他的
Yeah. What the hell?

103
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:22,481
- 晚上好 古泽敏 - 米歇尔小姐 晚上好
- Good evening, Guzmin. - Miss Mitchell. Good evening.

104
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:24,396
晚安
Good night.

105
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,301
泰德 
Ted.

106
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,306
泰德 
Ted?

107
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,347
泰德 
Ted?

108
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:56,772
该死
Damn it!

109
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,190
古泽敏 早上好
Gugmin. Morning.

110
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,520
- 你好吗 - 早上好
- How's it going? - Morning.

111
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:04,356
和平常一样
Another day, another dollar?

112
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,029
你回来了
You're back.

113
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,445
带着面包和牛角面包
With bread and croissants?

114
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,664
你这个漂亮的英国混蛋
You beautiful British bastard.

115
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,297
早安 亲爱的
Morning, darling.

116
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:29,381
刚刚去给我们买早餐了
Just popped out to get us some breakfast.

117
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,796
嗯 好的 当然
Oh, yeah, sure. Of course.

118
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,064
快上来
Yeah, come on up.

119
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:41,268
早安 我的宝贝
"Good morning, my darling. Morning... "

120
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,363
- 你进来了么 宝贝 - 我讨厌他
- Didn't you get in, my darling? -  I don't like him.

121
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,112
- 什么 - 泰德

122
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,324
- 你就见了他半分钟 - 那已经够久的了
- You met him for 30 seconds. - Even that was too long.

123
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:52,775
嗯 好的 他非常的友好
Okay, well, he's perfectly nice.

124
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,260
好吧 这可能是一种习惯
All right, it's probably a cultural thing.

125
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,494
你对别人太苛刻了
You're way too hard on people.

126
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,195
古泽敏 你不能对每个人我带回家的人
Guzmin, you have to stop failing everyone

127
00:08:57,246 --> 00:09:00,206
- 都有意见 - 他没什么脑子
- that I bring home, okay? - He is empty-headed.

128
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:02,209
你是有博士学位的智慧女人
You are a very bright woman with a PhD.

129
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:04,171
我只是怕你吃亏
I'm only thinking of your interests.

130
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,591
给他一个机会 好吗
Please give him a chance, all right?

131
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:10,260
他非常有礼貌 他 他还很性感
He is very polite, and he is, he is sexy

132
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,930
他还完成了
- and he is accomplished 

133
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:14,049
并且他回来了
and he is in the apartment.

134
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:16,266
- 吃牛角包吗 - 我什么时候错过
- Croissants? - Have I been ever wrong?

135
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,306
好的 太奇怪了 他就在这
Okay, this is getting weird. He's right here.

136
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,640
- 你在和谁说话呢 - 没什么 拜

Okay. Um, do you know where the term

152
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,943
这个词从哪来的吗
"Flash in the pan" Comes from?

153
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,518
淘金者
Gold prospectors.

154
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,693
在筛子里看到闪光的金子
Seeing a flash of fool's gold in the sieve

155
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:50,902
或是一支不会射出子弹的步枪
or a musket flash that doesn't shoot a bullet.

156
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:53,112
- 对么 - 对

我以前都不知道
I didn't know that.

159
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:59,622
你看起来不太一样 你换发型了吗
You look different. Did you change your hair?

160
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,449
没啊 哪不一样了呢
No. How different?

161
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:04,616
感觉你有一点变化
Something has changed about you.

162
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,044
嗯 那可能是我有点伤心
Oh, well, uh, yeah, maybe I'm a bit sad.

163
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:08,544
为什么有点伤心呢
Why a bit sad?

164
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,295
泰德 先生今晚没来么

对没错
Right. Yeah.

169
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:25,063
你的眼光很犀利 古泽敏
Your instincts are very spot-on, Guzmin.

170
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:26,652
有点不可思议
It's sort of uncanny.

171
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,396
我们这行 就要学会看人
Where I'm from, you learn to read a man.

172
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,899

你知道 孩子需要父母

一个宝宝需要一个母亲和一个父亲

202
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:21,318
这话是不是太保守了
What conservative nonsense this is?

203
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,611
我 不是这个意思 显然
No, I don't mean it like that, obviously, I...

204

没人会批评你 做你想做的
No one is going to judge you. Do what you wish.

219

别因为畏惧而不做

在生活中你一定要有自己行动

You have made such a big thing out of protecting me

227
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:54,327

鼓励我独自生活

但你不再孤单了

Oh, I'm from England. It's the center of urbanity.

242
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,636
你可能得喝点更烈的东西
Yeah, you should probably have something a little stronger.

243
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,297
请问两位喝什么
Hey, can I get you something to drink?

关于这事
You can have as much or as little as you want

252
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,005
你要多要少都无所谓

那个只有一条小鱼那么大的宝宝...
That little child, only the size of a small fish...

- 不 我是说你宝宝的爸爸
- No, I mean the baby's daddy. 

298
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:28,448
对 我都忘了还有个宝宝了
Right. I forgot there's a baby.

299
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:31,416
不 当时我的羊水提前破了
Um, no. My water broke early,

300
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:34,537
我发了短信给他 但他出城了
and, uh, I texted him, but he's out of town.

301
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:36,745
- 理解
- Understood. 

302
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,796
其实我们不是夫妇 
We're not a couple, you know.

303
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,430
他是个很好的人 他是个好人 但是
Oh, he's a great guy, he's a good guy, but, um,

304
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,587
我们不是 其实... 
we're not, you know, um...

305
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,466
我不知道我为什么要和你说这些
I don't know why I'm telling you this.

306
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:48,393
我也不知道 但我听到你说的了
I have no idea, but I hear you.

307
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:51,523
老实说 我们更喜欢这样
And, to be honest, uh, we kind of prefer it this way,

308
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:53,771
- 因为我们碰到过很多晕过去的爸爸
- because we have a lot of fainters. 

309
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,443
婴儿的心跳很好
Baby's heart is good.

310
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:58,611
来得有点早 但现在不要阻止他或她
A little early to the party, but no stopping him or her now.

311
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,991
我还没想好要不要上镇痛泵
I haven't decided yet if I'm gonna get an epidural,

312
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:02,989
我过会再决定也可以吧
but I can decide later, right?

313
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:04,781
比如 如果真的很疼
Like, if it gets really bad.

314

'Cause your baby's heart rate, it's a little fast right now,
