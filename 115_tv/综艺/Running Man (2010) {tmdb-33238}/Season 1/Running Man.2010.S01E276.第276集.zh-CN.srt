- Just stories Waru

- More people are going to die.

You are so close to loose everything.

We work to hard and too long for you
mess it up now.

- Hi.
- How are we today?

15
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:33,683
A little bit nervous. I've been
through this quite a few times.

16
00:01:34,053 --> 00:01:37,154
We've managed to harvest and
fertilize very impressive embryos.

17
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:38,622
I have full confidence.

18

Oh, this is my husband.

Jarrod Slade.

20
00:01:43,028 --> 00:01:44,861
- Pleased to meet you.
- And you.

21
00:01:44,963 --> 00:01:46,396

23
00:01:54,506 --> 00:01:55,705
Think boy or girl.

00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:56,840
All right, Charlotte.

25
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:58,575
I'm just gonna ask you to relax.

So why are we here?

00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:28,070
Charlotte's filled me in with what
you're trying to do in the Zone.

78
00:06:28,405 --> 00:06:31,173
The issues you're facing with
a lack of basic amenities,

79
00:06:31,442 --> 00:06:34,009
the ongoing accommodation crisis.

80
00:06:34,245 --> 00:06:36,044

- Mmm.

Yours is a good cause.

84
00:06:44,054 --> 00:06:46,021
Right in my own backyard, too.

85
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,790
Well, not quite your backyard.

86
00:06:49,093 --> 00:06:51,126
Come on, you tell me how much you need

87
00:06:51,462 --> 00:06:54,029
to kick-start some real
improvements in the Zone.

88

300,000.

89
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,167
From what I understand of the situation,

90
00:06:59,403 --> 00:07:01,436
300 won't touch the sides.

91
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:06,842
Three million.

92
00:07:08,112 --> 00:07:09,878
You're a man of vision, Waruu.

93
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,414
Why don't we add another zero to that?

94
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,449
Can't take that much money.

95
00:07:14,652 --> 00:07:16,051
30 million.

96
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,186
Now you can leverage off that capital.

97
00:07:18,489 --> 00:07:22,424
Turn it into 300 million.
Build a citadel.

98

to have a real stake

in your people's future.

100
00:07:26,964 --> 00:07:29,164
Before people like Matthews
take that away, too.

101
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:31,600
I would feel comfortable with less.

102
00:07:31,935 --> 00:07:36,571
Moses led the Israelites

Let's go.

111
00:09:11,835 --> 00:09:13,869
If we go into the Zone half-cocked,

112
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:15,470
we will lose personnel.

Send a couple of cars in.

119
00:09:31,955 --> 00:09:33,655
I don't care about collateral damage.

120
00:09:33,891 --> 00:09:35,190

00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:44,666
You killed Dickson?

00:09:44,968 --> 00:09:47,936
No, I just made the best

That symbol on the wall, that was you?

Your approval rating
went up 10 percentage points

after that image went viral.

00:10:40,491 --> 00:10:43,358
I know it hurts. Just try and
keep them open. What happened?

147
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:45,861
We were just fooling around and
the guards pulled out their guns.

148
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,798
Then they went Uncle Max. Kicked
him on the ground and stuff.

- Don't you, Kora?
- Ass.

167
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,556
I remember when I first met him.

168
00:11:47,724 --> 00:11:49,286
I was 13

169
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,327
sleeping rough under a bridge.

170
00:11:54,231 --> 00:11:56,998
But it was better than sleeping
at home with a randy old man.

171
00:11:58,101 --> 00:11:59,834
It was cold.

172
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,206
Freeze a witch's tit off cold.

173
00:12:07,444 --> 00:12:09,711
And this guy comes up asking
for somewhere to sleep.

174
00:12:10,047 --> 00:12:11,713
- But he didn't have anything.
- I just split the Zone.

175

<i>He was full of the same old Koen shit.</i>

You're a funny bastard when you
want something, aren't you, Koen?

178
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:29,230
Then he wanted my sleeping bag.

179
00:12:32,235 --> 00:12:34,269
Later he wanted my girlfriend.

180
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:42,077
- <i> I knew.</i>
- No.

181
00:12:43,914 --> 00:12:45,480
No.

182
00:12:45,782 --> 00:12:47,649
Come on, brother, you got that wrong.

183
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,686
That's not what she's saying.

184
00:12:55,592 --> 00:12:57,592
Kora, do you concur?

186
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,995
Kora concurs. So that's three

187

195
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:49,511
It didn't mean anything.

196
00:13:49,846 --> 00:13:52,747

00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,939
(laughs)

324
00:23:55,242 --> 00:23:57,375
And, what, Jarrod Slade's just gonna

325
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:58,676
hand over the money just like that?

326
00:23:58,912 --> 00:24:00,144
It's already in our bank account.

327
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:01,946
What?

328
00:24:04,284 --> 00:24:06,517
When a white man gives a black
man that kind of money,

329
00:24:06,753 --> 00:24:07,986
he wants something back.

330
00:24:08,188 --> 00:24:09,420
What does he get?

331
00:24:09,723 --> 00:24:11,856
- He's a philanthropist.
- What does he get?

332
00:24:11,977 --> 00:24:13,576
I'm trying to create a viable
future here for our people

333
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,393
- and you're asking me questions?
- It's a simple question.

334
00:24:15,459 --> 00:24:17,862
- What does he get?
- What options do we have?

335
00:24:18,131 --> 00:24:20,231
Hey. What are you doing up?

336
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,267
You all right?
You want something to eat?

337
00:24:22,569 --> 00:24:26,905
No, I'm good. I'm here
to speak with my son.

338
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,706
Who won't even look at me.

339
00:24:28,909 --> 00:24:31,075
What do you want?

340
00:24:31,311 --> 00:24:34,012
Some bad shit's been going down.

341
00:24:34,281 --> 00:24:36,814
Jimmy... he's messed things up.

342
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,016
What are you on about?

343
00:24:38,184 --> 00:24:40,585
Koen.

344
00:24:40,787 --> 00:24:42,420
He needs your help.

345
00:24:42,589 --> 00:24:44,155
Koen's here?

346
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,990
In the Zone?

347
00:24:46,192 --> 00:24:48,059
Right next door.

348
00:24:54,634 --> 00:24:58,336
Linda: <i>Says he found her
in some sort of laboratory</i>

349
00:24:58,638 --> 00:25:01,205
<i>tied to a bed with tubes
sticking out of her.</i>

350
00:25:01,441 --> 00:25:03,341
<i>Mean anything to you?</i>

351
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:05,643
- No.
- <i> Jimmy, did he mention?</i>

352
00:25:05,946 --> 00:25:07,679
Jimmy stopped making
any sense a long time ago.

353
00:25:07,914 --> 00:25:10,348
<i>(people shouting)</i>

354
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:12,150
How did you find this place?

355
00:25:12,352 --> 00:25:14,419
She called me.

356
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:17,121
Got inside my head.

357
00:25:17,357 --> 00:25:20,291
<i>Calling over and over.</i>

358
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,559
What else?

359
00:25:21,828 --> 00:25:25,196
I grabbed her, took her to the bar.

360
00:25:26,499 --> 00:25:28,366
Then nothing till...

361
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:32,503
this guy came around looking for her.

362
00:25:32,706 --> 00:25:35,807
<i>He had a gun.</i>

363
00:25:36,042 --> 00:25:38,743
He killed my friend.

364
00:25:39,045 --> 00:25:41,112
- <i> So I shot him.</i>
- Now, that was smart.

365
00:25:41,448 --> 00:25:43,214
- <i> There was this other dude.</i>
- Shoot him, too?

366
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:46,451
Different bloke. Tall.

367
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,920
Spoke with his head up his ass.

368
00:25:49,222 --> 00:25:52,090
<i>Coming offering condolences for Jimmy.</i>

369
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:55,126
<i>Told me he was a friend of his.</i>

370
00:25:55,362 --> 00:25:57,428
Offered me a job, too.

371
00:25:57,664 --> 00:25:59,464
Straight out of the blue.

372
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:00,898
What'd you tell him?

373
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,467
Told him to get lost.

374
00:26:02,702 --> 00:26:04,836
You seen a guy like that?

375
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,108
<i>Well, Kora needs to be sent back.</i>

376
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,076
<i>First things first.</i>

377
00:26:12,345 --> 00:26:15,713
We have to get rid of the Namorrodor.

378
00:26:15,915 --> 00:26:18,549
That's your job...

379
00:26:18,718 --> 00:26:20,151
Cleverman.

380
00:26:21,154 --> 00:26:22,653
It always comes back to that.

381
00:26:22,989 --> 00:26:25,923
Killing it's the only thing
that's gonna save the Hairies.

382
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,694
-<i> We should do it tonight.</i>
- Now?

383
00:26:29,863 --> 00:26:32,697
Why not?

384
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,299
Before more people get killed.

385
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:38,569
Your call.

386
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,641
And leave her at home.

387
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,453
I was thinking...

388
00:26:55,755 --> 00:26:58,623
maybe it's time you wound up
your work in the Zone.

389
00:26:58,892 --> 00:27:00,925
<i>At least till after the baby.</i>

390
00:27:01,194 --> 00:27:03,161
That's eight and a half months away.

391
00:27:04,631 --> 00:27:06,230
What am I gonna do instead?

392
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:09,300
- Stay home and crochet?
- There's a thought.

393
00:27:09,602 --> 00:27:12,537
I intend to work until the day I drop.

394
00:27:12,872 --> 00:27:15,740
If you were working in an
office or a GP practice, maybe.

395
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:17,175
Oh, come on.

396
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:19,710
It's a dangerous place.

397
00:27:19,913 --> 00:27:21,879
It's not your battle.

398
00:27:22,148 --> 00:27:23,848
Someone needs to take a stand.

399
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:27,051
Those CA animals used capsicum
spray on an unarmed man today.

400
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,787
Exactly, a volatile situation.

401
00:27:31,391 --> 00:27:33,658
It's not just you to consider.

402
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,530
Ah, you thinking about your heir?

403
00:27:39,766 --> 00:27:41,632
You are, aren't you?

404
00:27:42,721 --> 00:27:45,922
Our baby is in rudest of rude health.

405
00:27:46,439 --> 00:27:48,005
Okay? I did an ultrasound today.

406
00:27:48,274 --> 00:27:50,575
Its development is off the charts.

407
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,310
Must be my good genes.

408
00:27:52,479 --> 00:27:53,945
(laughs)

409
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,048
What you gonna be like
in eight and a half months, eh?

410
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,983
A monster.

411
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,874
So we lure this thing.

412
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,942
Say it comes.

413
00:28:25,111 --> 00:28:26,978
Then what?

414
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,046
Then you kill it.

415
00:28:29,349 --> 00:28:31,516
And it goes back
to wherever it came from?

416
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,053
<i>And Kora?</i>

417
00:28:36,322 --> 00:28:38,089
You'll be in your full powers.

418
00:28:38,391 --> 00:28:40,958
You open up the portal,
you send her back.

419
00:28:46,466 --> 00:28:48,533
That's not gonna work.

420
00:28:48,801 --> 00:28:50,201
You bring the nulla nulla?

421
00:28:50,403 --> 00:28:52,203
It's in the boot.

422
00:28:52,405 --> 00:28:54,238
It's in the boot.

423
00:28:54,474 --> 00:28:56,107
You better go and get it.

424
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,876
So, what, I just club it to death?

425
00:28:59,045 --> 00:29:00,611
I guess.

426
00:29:00,914 --> 00:29:02,346
Is that all the advice
you're gonna give me?

427
00:29:02,649 --> 00:29:06,984
It's quick and it goes for the heart.

428
00:29:08,821 --> 00:29:10,988
(chuckles)

429
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,526

00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,703
Go, go, go! Go!

432
00:30:33,906 --> 00:30:36,107

It's not working.

It's not coming, Waruu.
Something's wrong.

438
00:31:12,394 --> 00:31:15,228
- It's probably your chanting.
- You want to do this or not?

439
00:31:15,597 --> 00:31:17,730
'Cause you don't look like you do.
Looks like you want to run.

440
00:31:17,832 --> 00:31:19,232
Stuff you.

441
00:31:22,938 --> 00:31:25,471
Go on, then. Take it.

442
00:31:27,142 --> 00:31:28,441
Go on, take it.

443
00:31:28,777 --> 00:31:31,110
Uncle Jimmy stuffed up. This
is your chance to unstuff it.

444
00:31:32,948 --> 00:31:35,548
Take the nulla nulla, Waruu.

445
00:31:35,784 --> 00:31:37,317
Go on, be the Cleverman.

That's not how this works.

449
00:31:47,562 --> 00:31:49,228
What?

450
00:31:49,497 --> 00:31:51,831
Am I supposed to die first? That it?

451
00:31:58,139 --> 00:32:00,673
That's what you're waiting
for, isn't it, you dog?

452
00:32:03,645 --> 00:32:05,712
I know I die.

453
00:32:07,182 --> 00:32:08,715
I've seen it.

454
00:32:08,984 --> 00:32:10,817
What you see and what eventually...

455
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:13,219
So how does it work, then, brother, huh?

456
00:32:13,521 --> 00:32:15,254
Tell me, do I get mauled to death,

457
00:32:15,457 --> 00:32:17,056
and then you take over?

458

<i>Be the man you've always wanted to be?</i>

00:32:34,042 --> 00:32:35,575
Yeah, run.

461
00:32:35,844 --> 00:32:38,011
That's what you're good at, boy.

462
00:32:38,246 --> 00:32:40,780
You're a sellout, Koen.

<i>Sell your own mother if you could.</i>

Even when we were kids,

it's always been about my mother, eh?

466
00:32:52,594 --> 00:32:54,394
Koen's a coconut.

467
00:32:54,629 --> 00:32:56,896
Koen's got a white slut mother.

468
00:32:59,634 --> 00:33:01,300
Well, I never had a chance to meet her,

469
00:33:01,636 --> 00:33:03,936
so I don't know how
you're such an expert.

Huh?

471

Your mother was a whore.

I'm gonna let you in on a secret.

488
00:35:24,078 --> 00:35:25,912
I can fly.

489
00:35:27,348 --> 00:35:29,415
When we fly,

490
00:35:29,617 --> 00:35:33,586
the pain just goes away.

491
00:35:33,788 --> 00:35:35,054
You want to try?

492
00:35:35,356 --> 00:35:38,224
- (imitating airplane)
- (boy laughing)

493
00:35:52,173 --> 00:35:53,973
Djukara.

494
00:35:58,713 --> 00:36:00,313
Okay, bud.

495
00:36:00,548 --> 00:36:02,114
Djukara's out of fuel now.

496
00:36:02,217 --> 00:36:04,317
Mungo.

497
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,601
It all go down how you wanted?

498
00:36:25,673 --> 00:36:27,907
What's happened to you?

499
00:36:30,345 --> 00:36:31,811
I can explain.

500
00:36:31,913 --> 00:36:33,546
No need.

501
00:36:33,748 --> 00:36:35,114
I saw the tape.

502
00:36:35,416 --> 00:36:37,817
You killed that guard
with your bare hands.

503
00:36:38,086 --> 00:36:40,419
No, no. It wasn't like that.

504
00:36:40,622 --> 00:36:41,587
I saw how it was.

505
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,723
Nerida, I swear I had no choice.

506
00:36:44,025 --> 00:36:47,627
- You have to believe me.
- Believe you? How can I?

507
00:36:49,197 --> 00:36:50,930
Well, come on, then.

508
00:36:51,165 --> 00:36:53,432
Give me your reason.

509
00:36:53,635 --> 00:36:55,601
Level with me.

510
00:36:55,837 --> 00:36:58,037
Tell me what's going on.

511
00:36:59,674 --> 00:37:01,607
Hmm?

512
00:37:01,909 --> 00:37:04,076
Tell me about this deal
you've got with Slade.

513
00:37:06,781 --> 00:37:09,315
Tell me.

514
00:37:09,617 --> 00:37:12,118
Must be pretty freaking bad
if you can't tell me.

515
00:37:13,955 --> 00:37:15,788
Is it worse than killing a
man with your bare hands?

516
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,523
It was him or me.

517
00:37:19,394 --> 00:37:21,594
I thought I knew you.

518
00:37:21,863 --> 00:37:24,630
I've no freaking idea who you are.

519
00:37:26,501 --> 00:37:30,002
- Look, Nerida.
- No, don't you touch me.

520
00:37:35,343 --> 00:37:38,344
<i>(train rattling)</i>

521
00:37:45,353 --> 00:37:46,752
<i>(people chattering)</i>

522
00:37:46,854 --> 00:37:48,621
Hey.

523
00:37:59,534 --> 00:38:01,434
(grunts)

524
00:38:03,104 --> 00:38:05,071
It's your fault my sister's dead.

525
00:38:06,708 --> 00:38:09,475
You have destroyed everything.

526
00:38:09,577 --> 00:38:11,577
Shoot.

527
00:38:12,814 --> 00:38:15,047
Go on.

528
00:38:15,149 --> 00:38:16,916
Do it.

529
00:38:20,455 --> 00:38:22,254
- Do it!
- (gunshot)

530
00:38:22,557 --> 00:38:25,358
<i>- (dog barking)
- (people shouting)</i>

531
00:38:39,307 --> 00:38:41,907
(gasps)

532
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:54,253
Linda: <i>What happened out there?</i>

533
00:38:54,455 --> 00:38:56,055
Koen: <i>Nothing.</i>

534
00:38:59,293 --> 00:39:01,460
Never was going to.

535
00:39:02,597 --> 00:39:05,030
I'm not the one.

536
00:39:06,934 --> 00:39:08,401
I'm just a stuff-up.

537
00:39:08,603 --> 00:39:09,702
Don't say that.

538
00:39:09,904 --> 00:39:12,004
I couldn't save Ash.

539
00:39:17,712 --> 00:39:19,578
I couldn't save Ash.

540
00:39:22,216 --> 00:39:23,616
And a kid.

541
00:39:26,754 --> 00:39:29,855
Little Hairy girl is dead because of me.

542
00:39:35,963 --> 00:39:39,832
I sold her family out
to the CA for some extra cash.

543
00:39:42,203 --> 00:39:44,236
CA might have pulled the trigger,

544
00:39:44,505 --> 00:39:46,572
but it's my fault that she died.

545
00:39:50,111 --> 00:39:52,578
Doesn't sound so clever to me.

546
00:39:57,485 --> 00:39:59,585
(sniffles)

547
00:40:01,189 --> 00:40:03,355
She was just a kid.

548
00:40:05,026 --> 00:40:07,460
<i>And the last thing
that she said to me...</i>

549
00:40:10,031 --> 00:40:12,398
she thanked me.

550
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,133
Okay.

551
00:40:14,402 --> 00:40:16,669
Come here, love. Come on.

552
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,040
Minister.

553
00:40:37,342 --> 00:40:39,776
Your man McIntyre needs
to be pulled into line.

554
00:40:40,112 --> 00:40:42,879
He's refusing to send down
squads into the Zone.

555
00:40:43,181 --> 00:40:45,348
The brief has always been
one of containment.

556
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:48,785
Situations change, therefore
responses must change.

557
00:40:51,023 --> 00:40:53,990
You go in there armed
and it'll be carnage.

558
00:40:54,192 --> 00:40:55,625
That's the idea.

559
00:40:55,861 --> 00:40:57,761
<i>Assets will be destroyed.</i>

560
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:00,096
The general public won't like that.

561
00:41:02,034 --> 00:41:05,702
Right now we have the Zone
population like fish in a barrel.

562
00:41:05,971 --> 00:41:07,504
What are you guys up to in there?

563
00:41:07,873 --> 00:41:10,240
Don't worry. Our interests
are not mutually exclusive.

564
00:41:10,475 --> 00:41:12,375
I want the Zone cleared.

565
00:41:12,711 --> 00:41:14,611
If your company won't do it,
I'll find one that can.

566
00:41:14,913 --> 00:41:16,746
And risk losing the support
of my network?

567
00:41:17,015 --> 00:41:18,481
Do we have to keep playing this game?

568
00:41:18,784 --> 00:41:20,717
The public want to feel
safe in their homes

569
00:41:21,053 --> 00:41:23,653
and on the streets and I'm
gonna make that happen.

570
00:41:23,889 --> 00:41:26,389
The Zone will be cleansed.

571
00:41:30,228 --> 00:41:32,062
(sighs)

572
00:41:33,732 --> 00:41:36,399
And after it's empty...

573
00:41:36,568 --> 00:41:38,001
this.

574
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:41,204
Top-floor penthouse I've set aside.

575
00:41:41,406 --> 00:41:43,173
Wonderful, isn't it?

576
00:41:43,408 --> 00:41:46,609
Sweeping 360 views of the city,

577
00:41:46,778 --> 00:41:48,478
the harbor.

578
00:41:48,647 --> 00:41:50,280
(sighs)

579
00:41:50,582 --> 00:41:53,650
I reckon you're gonna
be happy living there.

580
00:41:55,887 --> 00:41:58,421
I've been talking to Frankie
about purchasing you.

581
00:42:00,225 --> 00:42:01,825
Outright.

582
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:14,304
Okay, so you take these twice a day.

583
00:42:14,506 --> 00:42:17,006
<i>(boy wheezing)</i>

584
00:42:19,044 --> 00:42:21,244
And some Valium while you're at it.

585
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:22,512
<i>Okay.</i>

586
00:42:22,714 --> 00:42:24,647
<i>(boy moaning)</i>

587
00:42:24,816 --> 00:42:26,716
Eve.

588
00:42:27,018 --> 00:42:29,419
There's something weird on his skin.
Scratches.

589
00:42:29,654 --> 00:42:30,987
They're getting bigger.

590
00:42:32,924 --> 00:42:35,492
Charlotte: <i>Hey, are you okay?</i>

591
00:42:35,727 --> 00:42:40,296
<i>Ooh, doesn't look good.</i>

592
00:42:40,499 --> 00:42:43,066
<i>Hold on...</i>

593
00:42:46,671 --> 00:42:48,271
When did this happen?

594
00:42:48,473 --> 00:42:50,173
I don't know.

595
00:42:50,342 --> 00:42:52,409
Shh.

596
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:54,611
Come on, lie back.

597
00:43:03,188 --> 00:43:06,189
Alinta, go get Koen now.

598
00:43:07,926 --> 00:43:11,194
Eve, you still got them
eucalyptus leaves I gave you?

599
00:43:12,764 --> 00:43:13,863
What do I tell him?

600
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:15,398
Tell him to get here now

601
00:43:15,667 --> 00:43:17,100
or I'll kick his ass into tomorrow.

602
00:43:17,302 --> 00:43:18,735
Go on, get him.

603
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:20,837
Do you know what this is?

604
00:43:21,206 --> 00:43:25,375
Yeah. I'm afraid there's nothing
in your bag of tricks to fix this.

605
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:28,611
It's not a what, it's a who.

606
00:43:40,725 --> 00:43:43,426
You've been to a smoking
ceremony before, haven't you?

607
00:43:43,595 --> 00:43:44,961
Yeah.

608
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:47,430
Good. You're running this one.

609
00:43:47,699 --> 00:43:49,732
There's a young boy in there

610
00:43:49,968 --> 00:43:51,434
in a whole lot of pain.

611
00:43:51,703 --> 00:43:53,002
Something wrong about it all.

612
00:43:53,305 --> 00:43:54,804
Go and get your dad.
He should be doing this.

613
00:43:55,073 --> 00:43:56,906
Nah, time for you to step up.

614
00:43:57,142 --> 00:43:59,776
I'm not the one. Get Waruu.

615
00:44:00,045 --> 00:44:01,611
We don't always get a chance to do good.

616
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:05,415
If I was you, I'd grab this
opportunity with both hands.

617
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:21,030
<i>(boy moans)</i>

618
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:24,968
I know, right?

619
00:44:27,339 --> 00:44:29,372
Okay, everyone's got to get out now.

620
00:44:29,574 --> 00:44:31,541
Okay, clear out.

621
00:44:31,743 --> 00:44:33,776
Go on, get, now.

622
00:44:34,012 --> 00:44:36,045
<i>All of you, go on.</i>

623
00:44:41,186 --> 00:44:43,019
You, too, darling.
It's not safe for you.

624
00:44:43,221 --> 00:44:44,854
You have to go.

625
00:44:47,526 --> 00:44:49,526
- Over to you.
- I can't.

626
00:45:05,143 --> 00:45:07,810
(singing in native dialect)

627
00:45:44,983 --> 00:45:48,351
Whoever's in there,
it's safe to come out.

628
00:46:03,134 --> 00:46:06,269
Follow the smoke. It will set you free.

629
00:47:21,112 --> 00:47:22,545
I'm so sorry.

630
00:47:26,484 --> 00:47:28,584
Please forgive me.

631
00:47:40,832 --> 00:47:43,499
The smoke will lead you
where you need to go.

632
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:11,127
(singing continues)
