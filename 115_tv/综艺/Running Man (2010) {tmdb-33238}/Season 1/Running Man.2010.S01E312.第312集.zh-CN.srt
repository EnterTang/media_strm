这是个很棒的礼物
Come on, Ray.
Honey, it's a great present.

3
00:00:06,108 --> 00:00:07,666
你在这上面写的祝词
非常完美
What you wrote
on it is perfect,

4
00:00:07,709 --> 00:00:10,507
就算不行你也来不及改了
因为今天已经是圣诞夜了
and you can't change it now anyway
because it's Christmas Eve.

5
00:00:10,545 --> 00:00:12,536

Michael, Geoffrey,
Ally, Debra and Ray."

￡- lt's stupid!
￡- Oh!

9
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:26,521
不，每个人都会喜欢这件礼物的，OK？
No, everybody's going to love
this present, okay?

10
00:00:26,561 --> 00:00:29,428
就这样吧，你的主意棒极了
Accept it, you had
a great idea.

11
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:33,360
我为什么要写“耶诞”？
Why did l put Xmas,
you know?

12
00:00:33,402 --> 00:00:35,666
我不喜欢“耶诞”
l don't like Xmas.

13
00:00:35,704 --> 00:00:37,695
把寿星的名字都给省略了
l X￡-ed out the name
of the birthday boy.

14
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,468
雷，够了！
Ray, stop!

15
00:00:39,508 --> 00:00:41,703
别再困扰了，OK？
我很喜欢它
Stop obsessing, okay?
l love it.

16
00:00:41,743 --> 00:00:45,770
我的上帝啊，一个面包机说了两个月
My God, it's been
two months of toaster!

17
00:00:45,814 --> 00:00:48,612
嘿，这东西送出去的时候可是刻着我的大名的
Hey, this is going out
with my name on it.

18
00:00:50,185 --> 00:00:52,585
－ 送给你父母的那只包装好了吗？
－ 是的
￡- Did you wrap the one for your parents?
￡- Yes.

19
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:55,556

￡- Which wrapping?
￡- The foil.

20
00:00:56,792 --> 00:00:58,521

－ 什么？
￡- That tips off the gift.
￡- What?!

22
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:04,092
箔纸包装……
这是台不锈钢面包机啊！
Foil wrapping￡-￡-
it's a metal toaster!

23
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:06,566
你还不如直接用面包机包装算了
Why don't you just
wrap it in toast?

24
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,298
既然我驱车一整天去康乃狄格
Look, if l'm going to drive
all the way up to Connecticut

25
00:01:11,339 --> 00:01:13,307
和你的父母一起过圣诞节
to spend Christmas Day
with your parents,

26
00:01:13,341 --> 00:01:15,366
我就希望看到他们打开礼物时惊喜的样子
l want a good reaction
when they open the present.

27
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,346
箔纸包装就没惊喜了？
And the foil wrapping
kills that?

28
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:21,315
我不知道
l don't know.

29
00:01:22,918 --> 00:01:27,048
你觉得这台面包机对他们来说
够特别吗？
You think this toaster thing
is funky enough for them?

30
00:01:28,056 --> 00:01:30,684
它应该臭烘烘的？
Was it supposed
to be funky?

31
00:01:31,693 --> 00:01:34,287
我是说
For them, l mean￡-￡-

32

00:01:36,598 --> 00:01:39,089
哦，亲爱的
Oh, honey.

臭屁面包机！

很好，尽管取笑我吧

￡- No, l'm not!
￡- Oh yeah, your parents￡-￡-

41

￡- No, nobody feels that way.

42
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:02,454
我是个蠢蛋，OK？我承认
l'm a doofus, okay?
l admit it.

43
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:04,550
我开什么玩笑哪！看看我
Come on, who am l kidding?
Look at me.

44
00:02:04,593 --> 00:02:07,926
我是个可笑的傻瓜，带着个可笑的面包机
l'm a goofy doofus
with a foofy toaster.

45
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,124
什么？
What?

46
00:02:10,165 --> 00:02:12,156
我没事
Look, it's fine,
all right?

47
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,863
我不怪谁，你本来可以嫁得更好些
l'm not blaming anyone. l don't know,
you could have married better.

48
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,734
我不知道
l don't know.

49
00:02:19,774 --> 00:02:22,208
圣诞快乐，宝贝
晚安
Merry Christmas, honey.
Good night.

50
00:02:29,618 --> 00:02:33,145
噢天哪！瞧我的大鼻子！
Oh God!
Look at the size of my nose!

51
00:02:40,983 --> 00:02:43,781
像威尔士人那样说：
lechyd da!
And, as the Welsh say,
lechyd da!

52
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:44,911

雷，把礼物给他们
Come on, Ray.

他们会等我们走了才打开
You know what?
They'll open it when we leave.

57
00:02:55,131 --> 00:02:57,964
别这样，马上就打开吧
Oh stop it.
No, here it is, right here.

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,400

59
00:03:00,436 --> 00:03:02,996

00:06:56,575 --> 00:06:58,634
你给他们送了礼物，就会想着……
You give them a present,
you'll think that￡-￡-

132
00:06:58,677 --> 00:07:01,009

134
00:07:05,617 --> 00:07:07,585
－嘿，妈

￡- How was your Christmas?

136
00:07:10,822 --> 00:07:13,620
特而斯一家来了，我们一起唱歌
The Telsters came over
and we sang songs.

137
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:15,957
我们还喝了一些杏子酒
We even had
some Amaretto.

138
00:07:15,994 --> 00:07:18,189
你真该看看你爸的样子
You should have seen
your father.

139
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,460
他的表演真的太精彩了
He was wonderful.

140
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,902
好吧
Okay.

141
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,637
OK，你们生气了
因为我们跟她的父母一起过圣诞节
Okay, you're mad because we spent
Christmas Day at her parents' house.

142
00:07:31,677 --> 00:07:33,702
当然不是，亲爱的
Of course not, dear.

143
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:36,111
我懂得权衡利弊

144
00:07:36,148 --> 00:07:38,116
不过我还是挺希望你在这儿的

you were there, though.

145
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,313
你爸爸和一只垃圾桶跳舞
Your father danced
with a trash can!

146
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:45,085
是啊，精彩先生

147
00:07:45,123 --> 00:07:47,421
他快活得不得了
He had the time
of his life.

148
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:50,587
－他需要一些阿司匹林，可以吗？
－当然
￡- He needs some aspirin. May l?
￡- Yeah, sure.

149
00:07:53,632 --> 00:07:57,159
那么，妈
你今年得到什么好礼物了吗？
So, Ma, did you get

你知道……

我听说你碰到了罗比的滑雪女伴
l heard that you met
Robby's skiing date.

156
00:08:13,352 --> 00:08:15,115
你觉得她怎么样？
Did you like her?

157
00:08:19,157 --> 00:08:21,352
我去和爸爸谈
l'm talking to Dad.

158
00:08:25,097 --> 00:08:27,190
我喜欢她
l liked her.

00:08:27,232 --> 00:08:29,860
她送了我一些可爱的浴盐
She gave me

我跟你妈跳舞了

164
00:08:49,554 --> 00:08:52,250
她说跟你跳舞的是垃圾桶
She said it was
the trash can.

165
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:55,191
我把她换了垃圾桶

166
00:08:57,596 --> 00:08:59,359
好吧，听着

00:08:59,398 --> 00:09:01,059
你们打开我的礼物了没有？

168
00:09:01,099 --> 00:09:02,930

你们看清是什么了吗？
That's it?
Did you see what it was?

172
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:13,033
什么？当然
What? Yeah.

173
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:14,705
是个面包机
lt was a toaster.

174
00:09:14,746 --> 00:09:17,442
你们完全打开盒子了吗？
Did you open the box?

175
00:09:17,482 --> 00:09:18,676
是的
Yeah.

00:09:18,717 --> 00:09:20,878
你看见上面的字了？上面写了什么？
You saw what it said?

“面包大师”

179
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:29,857
那是很特别的，那是件特别的礼物
lt was special.
lt's a special thing.

180
00:09:31,296 --> 00:09:33,890
你们根本没打开盒子
你们应该打开看看的，爸爸
You didn't open the box.
You gotta open up the box, Dad.

181
00:09:33,932 --> 00:09:35,866
它在哪？
Come on.
Where is it?

182
00:09:42,007 --> 00:09:44,271
它……
l...

183
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:47,176
现在不在我身边
don't have it
with me right now.

184
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,317
什么意思？它在哪？
你们是不是把它处理掉了？
What do you mean? Where is it?
What did you do with it?

185
00:09:56,521 --> 00:09:59,581
你妈妈想要个自动咖啡壶
Your mother wanted
a coffee￡-maker.

186
00:10:05,997 --> 00:10:08,227
来了
Here we go.

187
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:09,858
你干了些什么？
What did you do?

188
00:10:11,536 --> 00:10:14,471
我的面包机去哪了？
你们都做了什么啊？
Where is my toaster?
What did you do?

189
00:10:14,506 --> 00:10:16,201
什么也没做，亲爱的
Nothing, dear.

190
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:19,142
当发现是个面包机时
我们就拿到了布鲁明戴尔商店
When we saw it was a toaster,
we took it over to Bloomingdale's

191
00:10:19,177 --> 00:10:21,873
把它换成了一台咖啡机
and traded it in
for the coffee machine.

192
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,677
什么？但是我……
What, but, l￡-￡-

193
00:10:24,716 --> 00:10:27,116
这根本不是从布鲁明戴尔商店买来的
it didn't even come
from Bloomingdale's.

194
00:10:27,152 --> 00:10:29,450
店里不知道的
They don't know that.

195
00:10:30,722 --> 00:10:33,657
那么你们骗了布鲁明戴尔？
So you lied
to Bloomingdale's?

196
00:10:33,692 --> 00:10:35,956
不是骗布鲁明戴尔先生
Not Mr. Bloomingdale.

197
00:10:35,994 --> 00:10:37,894
只是店里
Just the store.

198
00:10:38,997 --> 00:10:40,862
什么时候去换的？
When did you do this?

199
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:42,696
你送给我们的当天
The day you gave it to us.

200
00:10:42,734 --> 00:10:45,828
我不喜欢圣诞节后才去换礼品，人太挤了
l hate returning things after Christmas.
lt's so crowded.

201
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:48,101
－来点咖啡，亲爱的？
－不！不！
￡- Coffee, dear?
￡- No! No!

202
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:51,303
－我不要喝咖啡！
－味道不错的
￡- l don't want coffee!
￡- lt's very good.

203
00:10:52,811 --> 00:10:55,006
那不是个普通的面包机，妈！
That wasn't just
a toaster, Ma.

204
00:10:55,046 --> 00:10:57,514
它在说：“耶诞快乐，我们爱你”
lt said, "Merry Christmas.
We love you.

205
00:10:57,549 --> 00:11:00,109
“麦克、杰弗瑞、艾丽、黛博拉和雷”
Michael, Geoffrey, Ally,
Debra and Ray."

206
00:11:01,386 --> 00:11:03,581
它会说话？
lt spoke?

207
00:11:07,092 --> 00:11:08,992
不！
No!

208
00:11:09,027 --> 00:11:10,654
写在上面的！
On it!

209
00:11:10,695 --> 00:11:12,890
在侧面，我把字刻在了侧面
On the side.
l had it engraved on the side!

210
00:11:12,931 --> 00:11:15,695
－刻的？
－你刻字干什么？
￡- Engraved?
￡- What did you do that for?

211
00:11:15,734 --> 00:11:17,793
我也不知道！
l don't know!

212
00:11:17,836 --> 00:11:19,804
我原以为会很有意义
l thought it would
be nice.

213
00:11:19,838 --> 00:11:22,272
我原以为你们会喜欢
l thought you might
enjoy it,

214
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:25,435
你们两个神经病！
you psychopaths!

215
00:11:27,412 --> 00:11:29,937
那上面没我的名字？
Was my name on there?

216
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:32,848
我简直不敢相信！
你们知道我花了多少时间……
l can't believe this!
You know how much time and￡-￡-

217
00:11:32,884 --> 00:11:34,852

￡- Sweetie, sweetie￡-￡-

￡- No, it￡-￡-
￡- Shh, shh, shh.

219
00:11:38,056 --> 00:11:40,183
听着，宝贝，听着
All right,
listen, honey, listen.

220
00:11:40,225 --> 00:11:43,092
我理解你。我完全理解你的心情
l understand. l completely understand
why you're upset.

221
00:11:43,128 --> 00:11:45,255
但让我说两句
But let me
explain something.

222
00:11:45,297 --> 00:11:47,765
你看，这只自动咖啡壶
You see,
this coffee machine

223
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:51,667
会在早晨你起床之前就把咖啡煮好
has the coffee already made
when you come down in the morning.

224
00:11:58,276 --> 00:12:02,042
那面包机上有你儿子的名字
The toaster has
your son's name,

225
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:06,211
还有他家人的名字
and the names
of his family,

226
00:12:06,251 --> 00:12:08,185
你的孙子们
your grandchildren

227
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,519
还有他们的爱
都在上面
and their love on it.

228
00:12:12,557 --> 00:12:15,583
对不起，亲爱的
l'm sorry, dear.

229
00:12:15,627 --> 00:12:17,527
知道吗？
You know what?

230
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:21,020
也许我们可以在咖啡壶上也刻上名字
Maybe we can put the names
on the coffee machine.

231
00:12:26,404 --> 00:12:28,668
话说回来，你干嘛买个面包机？
What are you buying
a toaster for anyway?

232
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:31,039
－旧的还能用
－不是的
￡- Ours is still good.
￡- No, it's not!

233
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,805
的确还能用，宝贝
lt is, dear.

234
00:12:33,845 --> 00:12:35,813
你只是不会用
You just don't know
how to use it.

235
00:12:35,847 --> 00:12:37,781
你得先轻轻摇一下
You've got to rattle it
a little bit.

236
00:12:37,816 --> 00:12:40,307
然后再把面包拿出来翻个面
And then you pull the toast up
and turn it around

237
00:12:40,352 --> 00:12:43,583
－这样就能烘到另外一面了
－这跟面包没关系
￡- and then do it on the other side.
￡- lt's not about toast!

238
00:12:44,923 --> 00:12:47,255
我的礼物是有意义的
My gift had meaning.

239
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:50,455
每个人都喜欢我的面包机
除了你们之外，每个人都喜欢！
Everyone else loves the toaster!
Everyone else!

240
00:12:50,495 --> 00:12:52,190
每个人！
Everyone!

241
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:57,029
你们究竟是些什么人啊！！
Who are you people?!

242
00:13:05,043 --> 00:13:07,568
知道吗？每次我送你们礼物
You know what?
Any time l've ever given you a present,

243
00:13:07,612 --> 00:13:09,671
－都是被好心当成驴肝肺
－怎么会？
￡- it's never been any good.
￡- That's not true.

244
00:13:09,714 --> 00:13:13,275
－不是吗？那个微波炉
－哦，那个嘛
￡- No? The microwave.
￡- Well, that.

245
00:13:14,953 --> 00:13:17,513
我们不需要微波炉
We didn't need
a microwave.

246
00:13:17,555 --> 00:13:19,420
它们危害健康
And they're dangerous.

247
00:13:19,457 --> 00:13:21,982
如果我还想要孩子怎么办？
What if l wanted
to have more children?

248
00:13:29,401 --> 00:13:33,201
就算上帝答应，政府也不会答应的
lf God hasn't stopped you,
the government will.

249
00:13:35,974 --> 00:13:38,135
还有那个月月水果俱乐部
What about the
Fruit￡-of-the￡-Month club?

250
00:13:38,176 --> 00:13:40,144
那太疯狂了
That was insane!

251
00:13:40,178 --> 00:13:43,045
一整年的水果？
A year of fruit?

252
00:13:43,081 --> 00:13:46,710
他们到现在还给我寄宣传页
想叫我续会
You know they still send me
flyers wanting me to rejoin?

253
00:13:46,751 --> 00:13:49,083
还有杏子的图片
And pictures of apricots!

254
00:13:51,022 --> 00:13:54,458
－ 想想我会是什么感觉？
－ 你的感觉？
￡- How is that supposed to make me feel?
￡- How you feel?

255
00:13:54,492 --> 00:13:56,983
那我的感受又如何呢？
你想过没有？
How about how l feel?
You ever think of that?

256
00:13:57,028 --> 00:13:59,223
宝贝
Well, honey...

257
00:13:59,264 --> 00:14:02,427
我们才是不得不收那些礼物的人哪
we are the ones who have
to get these presents.

258
00:14:07,939 --> 00:14:10,100
我很抱歉
l'm sorry.

259
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,836
我不知道该说些什么了
l don't know
what else to say.

260
00:14:11,876 --> 00:14:16,006
说“谢谢你”，怎么样？
How about thank you?

261
00:14:16,047 --> 00:14:17,776
说“谢谢你”
Yeah, thank you.

262
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:20,216
正常人应该这么说
That's what people say.

263
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,887
我不管你们是不是需要面包机
也不管是不是浪费钱
l don't care if you need a toaster
or think it's a waste of money.

264
00:14:24,923 --> 00:14:26,891
你们收到礼物，应该说声谢谢
You take the gift
and you say thank you.

265
00:14:26,925 --> 00:14:30,326
知道为什么吗？
因为是我送的，我，雷蒙德！
And you know why?
Because it's from me! Me, me, Raymond!

266
00:14:30,362 --> 00:14:32,830
你们的傻儿子雷蒙德！
Your idiot son Raymond!

267
00:14:38,603 --> 00:14:40,434
他们怎么可能不喜欢面包机？
How could they not
like the toaster?

268
00:14:40,472 --> 00:14:42,633
他们甚至都没打开盒子
They didn't even open it.

269
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:44,608
就把它换掉了
They traded it in.

270
00:14:45,777 --> 00:14:48,337
没心没肺的精神病
Ungrateful mental cases.

271
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,316
也许问题的关键
You know, maybe
the question here

272
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,443
不是“他们为什么不喜欢我的礼物”
isn't, "Why don't they
ever like my presents?"

273
00:14:54,486 --> 00:14:56,716
而是
but rather,
"Why do l

274
00:14:56,755 --> 00:14:59,918
“为什么我那么渴望得到他们的赞赏”
so desperately need
their approval?"

275
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,448
啊！
Ah!

276
00:15:01,493 --> 00:15:03,222
闭嘴！
Oh shut up!

277
00:15:04,329 --> 00:15:06,354
闭嘴，换作是你你会有什么感觉？
Shut up!
How would you feel?

278
00:15:06,398 --> 00:15:08,593
我会有什么感觉？
How would l feel?

279
00:15:08,633 --> 00:15:10,533
也许你该读读我的书……
Maybe you'd like
to read my book￡-￡-

280
00:15:10,568 --> 00:15:13,230
“在路上：罗伯特巴龙的故事”
"You're in the way:
The Robert Barone Story."

281
00:15:16,341 --> 00:15:18,366
他不需要他们的赞赏
He doesn't need
their approval, sis.

282
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,901
他是个错误，他是被爱的
He's got it to a fault,
he's the beloved one.

283
00:15:20,945 --> 00:15:23,175
他们爱我，在乎我
Oh yeah, they love me,
they care about me.

284
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:26,047
他们那样伤害我还叫什么在乎？
How come they don't care
that they hurt my feelings, huh?

285
00:15:26,084 --> 00:15:29,019
你没亲身经历根本体会不到
That's right. You don't see them
doing anything about that!

286
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,557
－ 让我来说
－ 告诉他们实情就好了
￡- You let me do the talking.
￡- Just tell the truth.

287
00:15:35,593 --> 00:15:36,992
不，不
No, no, no.

288
00:15:37,028 --> 00:15:39,087
你从乡下来的？
Where are you from?

289
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:42,190
这面包机和咖啡壶我全要了
We walk out of here with the toaster
and the coffee thing.

290
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,599
什么？只要拿到雷蒙德的面包机就可以了
What?
Just get Raymond's toaster!

291
00:15:44,636 --> 00:15:46,570
－请下一位
－嘘
￡- Next in line, please.
￡- Shh!

292
00:15:46,604 --> 00:15:49,300
－别说什么……
－把嘴巴封起来，玛丽
￡- Just don't say anything that￡-￡-
￡- Lock it up, Marie!

293
00:15:50,442 --> 00:15:52,603
哈喽
Hello.

294
00:15:52,644 --> 00:15:55,977
－祝你圣诞快乐
－圣诞快乐
￡- And a merry Christmas to you!
￡- Merry Christmas.

295
00:15:56,014 --> 00:15:58,847
主赐予福佑
May our Lord and Savior
bestow many blessings

296
00:15:58,883 --> 00:16:01,443
给你和你的朋友
upon you and your
loved ones.

297
00:16:01,486 --> 00:16:03,579
谢谢，我是犹太人
Thank you.
l'm Jewish.

298
00:16:05,657 --> 00:16:07,488
哦
Oh.

299
00:16:07,525 --> 00:16:10,585
这些人们肯定屁股很痛，嗯？
All these people
must be a pain in the ass, huh?

300
00:16:10,628 --> 00:16:13,620
－弗兰克，别那么说！
－让我按自己的风格来
￡- Frank, don't say that!
￡- Let me do it my way.

301
00:16:13,665 --> 00:16:16,964
－你们要退货吗？
－是的
￡- Are you returning this?
￡- Yes, we are.

302
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:20,493
这玩意是个破烂
lt unfortunately
is a piece of crap.

303
00:16:20,538 --> 00:16:23,371
这很不错，我们只是想要点别的东西
lt's very nice.
We just would like something else.

304
00:16:23,408 --> 00:16:25,399
－不！
－这个有什么问题吗？
￡- No!
￡- Was there something wrong with it?

305
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,308
我们甚至都没拆开
We didn't even
open it.

306
00:16:30,648 --> 00:16:32,639
你帮倒忙啊！
This is how
you help?!

307
00:16:32,684 --> 00:16:34,811
说谎是你的主意
Lying was
your idea.

308
00:16:34,853 --> 00:16:37,981
我们今天为什么要说谎？
And why are we
lying today?

309
00:16:38,022 --> 00:16:42,015
我的儿子送了这台咖啡壶
他是一番好意
My son brought us this coffee￡-maker,
and he means well,

310
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,496
但我们想换个真正用得上的东西
but we would like to change it
for something we can really use.

311
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:48,522
比如说……
You know, like a￡-￡-
l don't know,

312
00:16:48,566 --> 00:16:51,091
一个面包机什么的
a toaster
or something?

313
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:54,036
好的，你们可以去那里挑一个
That's fine.
You can pick out a toaster over there.

314
00:16:54,072 --> 00:16:56,063
太感谢你了
Thank you
very much.

315
00:16:56,107 --> 00:16:57,597
拜拜
Shalom.

316
00:16:59,511 --> 00:17:02,344
－ 我们本来可以两个都要的
－ 哦看哪，面包大师
￡- We could have got both!
￡- Oh look, Toast Pro.

317
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,245
打开这些盒子
Open these boxes.

318
00:17:04,282 --> 00:17:08,116
－好的，好的
－找雷蒙德的面包机
￡- All right, all right.
￡- Just look for Raymond's toaster.

319
00:17:09,287 --> 00:17:11,915
对不起，有什么能帮忙的吗？
l'm sorry.
May l help you?

320
00:17:11,956 --> 00:17:14,356
我们自己能行，杰夫斯
We can handle it,
Jeeves.

321
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:17,985
我们想看一看
We're just checking these.

322
00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:21,556
我保证这些和样品是一样的
l can assure you they're all exactly
like the display model.

323
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,558
瞧，这本说明书有点折了
See, here's one where the pamphlet's
a little folded.

324
00:17:25,603 --> 00:17:28,163
你在干嘛？这根本不算是投诉
What are you doing?
That's not a believable complaint.

325
00:17:28,206 --> 00:17:29,867
这完全合情合理
lt's perfectly valid.

326
00:17:29,908 --> 00:17:32,342
你就不能安静一会吗？
Can't you ever
just be quiet?

327
00:17:32,377 --> 00:17:34,971
别对我指手画脚的
Don't you tell me
to be quiet!

328
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,846
我自己拿主意，我能解决好的
l have a mind of my own, you know?
l can contribute.

329
00:17:37,882 --> 00:17:40,976
我并不只是个天上掉下的林妹妹
l'm not just some
trophy wife!

330
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:57,534
你是天上掉下的林妹妹？
You're a trophy wife?

331
00:17:58,603 --> 00:18:02,061
我到底中了什么破奖啊？
What contest in hell
did l win?

332
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,870
不好意思，你们把每个盒子都打开了
Please. You've opened
every box.

333
00:18:06,911 --> 00:18:10,210
－我想问一下……
－你们不只有这些面包机吧？
￡- l'm going to have to ask￡-￡-
￡- This can't be every toaster.

334
00:18:10,248 --> 00:18:12,739
是的，仓库里还有一些
No, l'm sure there are
more in the stockroom.

335
00:18:12,784 --> 00:18:15,480
－仓库。拖住工作人员
－什么？
￡- Stockroom. Distract the workers.
￡- What?

336
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,010
继续唠叨就是了
Just keep yapping.

337
00:18:18,423 --> 00:18:22,519
我的丈夫对面包很挑剔的
My husband is very particular
about his toast.

338
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,835
真他妈见鬼！
Holy crap!

339
00:18:44,015 --> 00:18:47,178
我儿子送了我这台面包机
l got this toaster
for my son

340
00:18:47,218 --> 00:18:49,243
作为圣诞礼物
for Christmas
yesterday,

341
00:18:49,287 --> 00:18:51,585
但这上面有字
but it has
some writing on it.

342
00:18:51,623 --> 00:18:53,887
噢，你要换掉这个吗？
Oh, are you
exchanging that?

343
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:55,893
不，我才不会换
No, l wouldn't dream
of exchanging it.

344
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:57,918
这是我儿子给我的
l got it
for my son.

345
00:18:57,962 --> 00:19:00,294
换掉还算什么母亲
What sort of mother
would l be?

346
00:19:09,507 --> 00:19:11,099
好吧……
Well...

347
00:19:11,142 --> 00:19:13,906
如果是我我就会换掉它
看看那些字，傻得要命
l would exchange it because look
at that stupid writing on it.

348
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,708
但我喜欢
Oh but l love it.

349
00:19:15,747 --> 00:19:18,580
只不过是店里把名字弄错了
The store just got
the names wrong.

350
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:21,608
能不能帮我改一下名字
Could you change
the names

351
00:19:21,653 --> 00:19:25,316
改成“琼、哈维……
to June,
Harvey...

352
00:19:26,357 --> 00:19:28,325
“波比……”
Bobby￡-￡-"

353
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:30,850
这面包机是我儿子雷蒙德的
You see, this toaster's
from my Raymond.

354
00:19:30,895 --> 00:19:33,455
看看，我给你看，就是他
Look here.
Look, l'll show you. Here he is.

355
00:19:33,498 --> 00:19:35,830
这是麦克
Look, see.
And there's Michael

杰弗瑞
and Geoffrey

00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:40,201
还有艾丽
我倒是没有黛博拉的照片
and Ally and￡-￡-
l don't have a picture of Debra.

358
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:44,637
－把面包机给我，求你了
－不行，这是我儿子给我的
￡- Just give me that toaster, please.
￡- No, it's my son's.

359
00:19:44,676 --> 00:19:47,372
但那是我儿子的，他需要我拥有这台面包机
But it's my son.
He needs me to have a toaster.

360
00:19:47,412 --> 00:19:49,277
保安！
Security!

361
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,848
该死的累赘！
Stupid stinking hump!

00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:57,080
嘿
Hey!

363
00:19:57,121 --> 00:19:59,646
试试那个咖啡壶
Try a coffee machine.

364
00:20:04,557 --> 00:20:06,115
是谁的电话？
Who was that?

365
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,619
雷，我想你最好去一趟布鲁明戴尔超市
Ray, l think you'd better get down
to Bloomingdale's.

366
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,827
显然，你的父母涉嫌卷入一起
Apparently, your parents are involved
in some sort of disturbance

367
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:20,395
毁坏财物，
involving destruction
of property

368
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,102
和盗窃面包机的案件
and the possible
theft of a toaster.

369
00:20:31,017 --> 00:20:33,178
他们还是在乎的
They do care.
