At the time, although I was in my twenties

104

I was cast as an elementary student.
I was a favorable actor to the director.

As you may know, I was also
in 'Queen of Housewives.'

You like them, but you don't

I'm not good.

- Wait, actually?
- Yes.

136

So my image is a little feminine.

138

1102
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:06,960
[Team Yo Won's second attempt]
I think they'll do it.

1103
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,860
Get ready.

1104
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:11,990
You just ruin everything!

1105
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:14,930
We've been the last all along!

1106
01:03:14,930 --> 01:03:18,460
I think I would've been better by myself!

1107
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:20,930
- What?
- What is he talking about?

1108
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:22,960
We won because of me at first!

1109
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,160
Let's just break up
after this game!

1110
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:26,330
Let's break up!

1111
01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:30,060
We'll reduce two items for your acting.
Catch eight items.

1112
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:33,090
- Eight items?
- One...

1113
01:03:33,090 --> 01:03:37,330
two, three!

1114
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:42,060
[Amazing!]

1115
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:45,330
[Here you go!]

1116
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:46,940
It's a lot!

1117
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:53,730
[This looks the best ever.]

1118
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:59,530
One, two, three, four...

1119
01:03:59,530 --> 01:04:05,890
five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten!

1120
01:04:05,890 --> 01:04:11,160
Eleven, twelve... eighteen!

1121
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:16,390
- We did it!
- We reversed the score!

1122
01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:27,040
[Team Yo Won's been always the last.]

1123
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:32,550
[Right until the third stage,
their team was left alone again.]

1124
01:04:32,550 --> 01:04:36,920
[But they've turned the table!]

1125
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:41,220
[Will they be able to keep
the upturn until the end?]

1126
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:45,630
Sangam-dong, Mapo-gu...

1127
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:48,490
- That's where we started today.
- That's right.

1128
01:04:48,490 --> 01:04:49,860
Let's go!

1129
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:52,130
We've won in the end.

1130
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:54,190
I thought we would be the last place.

1131
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:57,590
Ye Rin, did you see
how we played with your mom?

1132
01:04:57,590 --> 01:05:00,460
This is how we are.

1133
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:03,490
That was great!

1134
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:08,930
There's traffic.

1135
01:05:08,930 --> 01:05:12,030
It's okay to be in traffic but...

1136
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:14,790
I need to go to the bathroom.

1137
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:18,360
What have you done to her?

1138
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:21,990
Why did you make her cry?

1139
01:05:21,990 --> 01:05:26,090
Why are you just standing there?
[This won't do.]

1140
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:30,490
<i>If the acting is good, we'll reduce
the number of the items.</i>

1141
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:35,930
I can't stand it any longer!

1142
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:42,860
[Oh my god!]

1143
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:47,290
Hit him harder!

1144
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:53,630
[Powerful slap]

1145
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:59,160
We'll reduce four items.
Just catch six items.

1146
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:02,190
You need to sweep it slowly.

1147
01:06:02,190 --> 01:06:05,790
Let's not catch at the same spot.
Catch it from the left.

1148
01:06:05,790 --> 01:06:07,660
Ready!

1149
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:10,840
One, two, three!

1150
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:15,160
[It's basket full of items.]

1151
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:18,590
- Great!
- We did it!

1152
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:22,860
One, two, three...

1153
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:27,790
four, five, six, seven

1154
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:30,960
eight, nine, ten, eleven!

1155
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:35,730
[Team Ye Ryun passes the fourth stage.]

1156
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:38,490
But we didn't really need the acting.

1157
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:42,290
We caught eleven items!

1158
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:45,430
[Thank you for the citizen's cooperation!]

1159
01:06:46,090 --> 01:06:50,290
[Team Ye Ryun heads to the last stage.]

1160
01:06:50,290 --> 01:06:53,730
Prism Tower,
it's the same place from before.

1161
01:06:53,730 --> 01:06:57,460
For the ending scene,
is there another game?

1162
01:06:57,460 --> 01:06:59,630
It seems like there's
something at the end.

1163
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:03,190
[This is a battle of speed.]

1164
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:08,000
[Which team will arrive
at the final stage first?]

1165
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:11,090
[The last casting call will be held]

1166
01:07:11,090 --> 01:07:15,690
[at the same place where
the production presentation was.]

1167
01:07:16,710 --> 01:07:20,760
[Team Yo Won gets there first.]

1168
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:23,160
Let's run!

1169
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:25,390
[They're heading to the third floor.]

1170
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:29,660
What's this?

1171
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:38,060
[The attack of the
group of desperate fans.]

1172
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:43,560
[Behind the fans, there are group
of reporters waiting for them!]

1173
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:46,230
[It feels nice to be welcomed!]

1174
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:49,230
[But they need to get to
the third floor quickly.]

1175
01:07:49,230 --> 01:07:52,370
[While team Yo Won are trapped
in the fans and the reporters...]

1176
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:55,990
I think we might have to
search for an item.

1177
01:07:55,990 --> 01:07:59,490
It's on the third floor, right?

1178
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:04,630
[Team Ye Ryun arrives at the final site!]

1179
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:08,290
Yo Won, hurry up!

1180
01:08:08,290 --> 01:08:11,630
[This is like a mad house!]

1181
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:14,360
[They're approaching to the entrance.]

1182
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:21,200
Please write the visitor's log.

1183
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,270
[They need to get a permit
to enter the building.]

1184
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:26,670
[They're almost out of their minds.]

1185
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:28,880
Please say a word.

1186
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:32,050
- Please leave a word for fans.
- I love you!

1187
01:08:32,050 --> 01:08:33,880
[They've got the permit.]

1188
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:38,050
[She still looks elegant like a queen.]

1189
01:08:39,350 --> 01:08:42,190
[Team Yo Won enters the building.]

1190
01:08:43,990 --> 01:08:46,560
[Team Ye Ryun gets to the lobby.]

1191
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,060
Are you running?

1192
01:08:50,670 --> 01:08:53,230
[Scream]
What should we do?

1193
01:08:53,230 --> 01:08:57,340
[The rush of fans and reporters]

1194
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:59,910
I love you!

1195
01:08:59,910 --> 01:09:03,980
[Don't get too excited,
We mobilized them.]

1196
01:09:06,450 --> 01:09:09,850
I think there's a mission
that we quickly need to do.

1197
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:14,450
[They arrive at the third floor.]

1198
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:18,390
Read this script and do the acting.

1199
01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:20,390
Can I go to the bathroom first?

1200
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:23,500
[In a daze]

1201
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:28,000
We're in a hurry!
Jae Suk!

1202
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,670
Give me a moment.

1203
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:33,210
[While Jae Suk is having
the personal moment...]

1204
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:35,570
[Team Ye Ryun goes through the lobby.]

1205
01:09:35,570 --> 01:09:38,010
[They get to the information desk.]

1206
01:09:39,810 --> 01:09:43,380
Are they here?

1207
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:45,520
That's enough!

1208
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,550
Hurry up and go!

1209
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:49,290
What's this?

1210
01:09:49,290 --> 01:09:52,660
[There's a wedding set in the studio.]

1211
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:55,290
Do what's in the script!

1212
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:58,500
[That's right, the script!]

1213
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:03,530
One person stand
in the middle of the arch.

1214
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:08,070
After saying the line,
hold a pose like the picture.

1215
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:10,210
[Huh?]
What's that?

1216
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:18,580
[In the meantime, Team Ye Ryun
is finishing up the permit.]

1217
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:21,220
- How are you doing, Gary?
- Doing great.

1218
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:25,620
[Now Team Ye Ryun
is heading to the third floor.]

1219
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:27,720
[Hurry up
before the other team comes!]

1220
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:29,930
Let me stand in the middle.

1221
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:33,060
Take this.

1222
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:35,200
I think we can win when we do this.

1223
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:38,830
Hurry up!
[Act the last scene and hold a pose!]

1224
01:10:38,830 --> 01:10:44,260
[Will they be able to finish acting
without getting interrupted?]

1225
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:47,380
The studio on the third floor.

1226
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:49,480
What would it be?

1227
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:52,120
[Are we the first team?]

1228
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:55,590
[Team Ji Hyo joins.]

1229
01:10:55,590 --> 01:10:58,390
What is it?

1230
01:10:58,390 --> 01:11:02,630
[He goes out the building.]

1231
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:06,830
[Please let us love.]

1232
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:12,000
[The bride and groom
enter the hall quickly.]

1233
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,840
Do you promise to love each other,
so long as you both shall live?

1234
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:20,810
Yes, I promise!

1235
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:25,280
I now pronounce you, spouses for life.

1236
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:28,920
[They only need to hold the pose.]

1237
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:32,090
[Hurry up!]

1238
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:36,290
Look, there are cameras everywhere.

1239
01:11:36,290 --> 01:11:38,460
It's weird.
There's got to be something.

1240
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:41,460
What's this?
[Team Ji Hyo is still in puzzlement.]

1241
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:43,560
[Scream]

1242
01:11:44,830 --> 01:11:47,670
[He shoots out a heart.]

1243
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:49,560
[The gunfire of fans]

1244
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:57,860
[Don't you forget
we need to do the mission!]

1245
01:11:59,180 --> 01:12:02,230
[Make a star with your hands.]

1246
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,620
[If no one interrupts them...]

1247
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:10,330
[Here we go!]

1248
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:19,860
Success!

1249
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:23,890
[Ha Ha, Lee Yo Won
and Yoo Jae Suk are cast!]

1250
01:12:23,890 --> 01:12:25,660
We did it!

1251
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:27,390
We turned around the result!

1252
01:12:27,390 --> 01:12:28,890
[Wait, there's no one here.]

1253
01:12:28,890 --> 01:12:32,060
Let's go sit at the top.

1254
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:34,930
[Before other teams get here...]

1255
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:39,690
They said do what's in the script.
Hurry up!

1256
01:12:39,690 --> 01:12:42,720
[We must be the first team.]

1257
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:45,060
[Relaxed]

1258
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:47,660
- Is this correct?
