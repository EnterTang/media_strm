1
00:00:00,975 --> 00:00:04,187
嘿嘿，星期六不许
Hey hey,
we don't have to have

2
00:00:04,229 --> 00:00:06,481
开牛仔会
this cowboy party
on Saturday.

3
00:00:06,481 --> 00:00:09,400
看我拿剪子把你们的生日
从日历上挖掉
I'II get my scissors and cut your
birthday right out of the caIendar.

4
00:00:11,861 --> 00:00:13,738
哦，拜托！
Oh, come on!

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,242
没准是推销波本威士忌的
Maybe this is
a bourbon saIesman.

6
00:00:18,493 --> 00:00:22,205
- 妈，嗨。哦我的天
- 嗨
- Mom, hi. Oh my gosh.
- Hi.

7
00:00:22,247 --> 00:00:24,958
你知道，你来早了。
生日聚会只开一天
You know, you're earIy.
The birthday party's not for two days.

8
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:28,378
不，我知道。
我今天过来是有事跟你说
No, I know. I came today
because I wanted to taIk to you.

9
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:31,464
- 你怎么不打电话？
- 你爸和我分开了
- But why didn't you caII?
- Your father and I have separated.

10
00:00:33,675 --> 00:00:35,969
哈喽，露易斯
HeIIo, Lois.

11
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,222
- 嗨，玛丽
- 我看到你开车来
- Hi, Marie.
- I saw you drive up.

12
00:00:39,264 --> 00:00:42,350
我得到的聚会时间是错的？
Was I given the wrong day
for the party?

13
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:45,562
怎么了？
What?

14
00:00:45,603 --> 00:00:47,814
什么事？
What's going on?

15
00:00:47,856 --> 00:00:50,275
我错过什么了吗？
Did I miss something?

16
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:52,735
- 我想我错过什么了
- 没事的
- I think I missed something.
- It's okay.

17
00:00:52,777 --> 00:00:55,655
- 一会见，好吗，玛丽？
- 我想我错过什么了
- We'II see you Iater, okay, Marie?
- I think I missed something.

18
00:00:55,697 --> 00:00:59,701
如果有人有话跟我说，
我就在街对面
If anybody needs to taIk to me,
I'm just right across the street.

19
00:01:01,244 --> 00:01:03,663
我做了香草巧克力蛋糕
I have marbIe cake!

20
00:01:06,908 --> 00:01:08,827
你说什么？
What are you
taIking about?

21
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:10,787
什么叫你们分开了？
What do you mean
you've separated?

22
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:13,331
唔，我不认为我和你父亲之间
WeII, I don't suppose
it's any secret

23
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:15,834
出了问题是什么秘密
that your father and I
have had our probIems.

24
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:19,754
我们甚至还试了新泽西的
婚姻咨询
We even tried that marriage counseIing
thing in New Jersey.

25
00:01:19,838 --> 00:01:21,965
咨询了一星期就这么个结果？
One week of counseIing and this is
what you come up with?

26
00:01:22,007 --> 00:01:23,925
你们就是这么解决问题的？
This is how
you work things out?

27
00:01:23,967 --> 00:01:26,761
哦，亲爱的，
这不可能是完全的惊人的
Oh, honey, this can't be
a compIete surprise.

28
00:01:26,803 --> 00:01:29,639
你知道我们从不是
真的合得来
You know we were never
truIy compatibIe

29
00:01:29,681 --> 00:01:32,976
而新泽西事实上
让我们明白了这点
and New Jersey actuaIIy
made us see that.

30
00:01:33,018 --> 00:01:35,145
哦，是啊，没错，
新泽西，
Oh, yeah, that's right,
New Jersey,

31
00:01:35,186 --> 00:01:38,148
“撒手放弃的州”
''The Just Give Up State.''

32
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:40,734
唔，41年了，
WeII, it was 41 years,

33
00:01:40,775 --> 00:01:42,944
所以你不能说我们
没有努力
so you can't say we didn't
give it a shot.

34
00:01:42,986 --> 00:01:44,905
现在请不要难过了，
Now pIease,
don't be upset,

35
00:01:44,946 --> 00:01:46,656
因为我就不，真的
because I'm not, reaIIy.

36
00:01:46,698 --> 00:01:50,202
我觉得美妙而自由
I feeI wonderfuI
and free.

37
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:53,747
你真难以置信。
那爸爸呢？
You're unbeIievabIe.
And what about Dad?

38
00:01:53,788 --> 00:01:56,917
唔，他也没事，
并且我们会保持亲近的
WeII, he's fine too,
and we'II stay cIose.

39
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:59,794
也许能成为
比以前更好的朋友
We'II probabIy be
better friends than before.

40
00:01:59,794 --> 00:02:02,214
你知道帕特和希瑞尔
也经过这个，
And you know Pat and CyriI
went through this,

41
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,216
他们现在快乐多了
and they're much
happier now.

42
00:02:04,216 --> 00:02:06,176
他们共有狗的监护权
They share custody
of the dogs.

43
00:02:09,804 --> 00:02:12,015
这太像你了，知道吗？
This is just Iike you,
you know?

44
00:02:12,057 --> 00:02:13,975
你时髦和赶潮流
的生活方式
Your hip
and trendy IifestyIe.

45
00:02:14,017 --> 00:02:16,519
现在兴分居了，
所以你们就做这个
It's chic to get separated now,
so that's what you do

46
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:18,438
不投入任何努力――
instead of putting
any effort into--

47
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,857
别这样，黛比拉，
这可不公平了
Come on, Debra,
now that's not fair.

48
00:02:20,857 --> 00:02:23,151
除了努力没别的了，
我试了
It's been nothing but effort,
and I have tried.

49
00:02:23,193 --> 00:02:25,111
你试的东西
You have never tried
anything for Ionger

50
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:27,197
从没长过杂志封面
than it was
on a magazine cover.

51
00:02:36,174 --> 00:02:38,343
玛丽
Marie.

52
00:02:39,094 --> 00:02:41,055
哈喽？
HeIIo?

53
00:02:47,353 --> 00:02:50,022
你好呀，露易丝
Hiya, Lois.

54
00:02:51,398 --> 00:02:54,360
我来找玛丽
I was Iooking
for Marie.

55
00:02:54,401 --> 00:02:57,529
哦，是吗？对我来说，
刚好相反
Oh, yeah? For me,
just the opposite.

56
00:03:00,574 --> 00:03:02,951
果汁？
Juice?

57
00:03:02,993 --> 00:03:04,828
不，谢谢
No, thank you.

58
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,624
你介意我在这待上一会吗？
WouId you mind if I
just hung out here for a bit?

59
00:03:17,424 --> 00:03:19,551
什么也没发生
Nothing's going on.

60
00:03:20,636 --> 00:03:22,596
你是什么？
What are you?

61
00:03:22,596 --> 00:03:24,807
穿上点衣服，
家里有客人
Put on some cIothes
with company in the house.

62
00:03:24,848 --> 00:03:27,101
什么客人？
她是家里人
What company?
She's famiIy.

63
00:03:27,142 --> 00:03:30,020
嘿，又没什么是她没在
华伦身上见到过的
Hey, there's nothing here
she ain't seen on Warren.

64
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,523
我说错了吗？
Am I wrong?

65
00:03:32,564 --> 00:03:36,110
嘿，华伦哪去了？
阿布达比（阿联酋首府）还是哪？
Hey, where is Warren?
Abu Dhabi or something?

66
00:03:36,151 --> 00:03:38,362
可能的
CouId be.

67
00:03:38,404 --> 00:03:40,239
我来就是为这事
That's why
I came over.

68
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,783
我想告诉你们
I want
to teII you that

69
00:03:42,825 --> 00:03:44,785
华伦和我分开了
Warren and I
are spIitting up.

70
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:51,125
我去穿裤子
I'II put pants on.

71
00:03:55,462 --> 00:03:57,381
哦
Oh.

72
00:03:57,423 --> 00:03:59,466
小可怜
You poor dear.

73
00:03:59,508 --> 00:04:01,635
不不，没事的，
玛丽
No no, it's okay,
Marie.

74
00:04:01,677 --> 00:04:03,303
没事的
It's okay.

75
00:04:03,345 --> 00:04:04,930
他要离开你了
He's Ieaving you.

76
00:04:04,972 --> 00:04:08,017
不，这完全是相互的
No, it's compIeteIy
mutuaI.

77
00:04:08,058 --> 00:04:10,894
我们都很开心，说实话
We're both
quite happy, honestIy.

78
00:04:10,936 --> 00:04:13,022
你不用在我面前掩饰
You don't have to
pretend with me.

79
00:04:13,063 --> 00:04:16,525
你可以告诉我
所有糟糕的细节
You can teII me
aII the awfuI detaiIs.

80
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:18,610
求你了
PIease.

81
00:04:18,652 --> 00:04:20,696
不，不要穿那条裤子。
这条要捐到美丽心愿（慈善机构）
No, not those pants.
They go to GoodwiII.

82
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:22,656
嘿，我喜欢这条裤子
Hey, I Iove these pants.

83
00:04:22,698 --> 00:04:24,992
你凭什么送去美丽心愿？！
Who the heII are you
to give 'em to GoodwiII?!

84
00:04:24,992 --> 00:04:27,661
屁股上有洞！
你都穿透了！
There are hoIes in the seat!
You've worn through them!

85
00:04:27,703 --> 00:04:30,914
那你就不能把它送去美丽心愿！
那是坏心愿！
Then you can't give 'em to GoodwiII!
That's bad wiII!

86
00:04:30,956 --> 00:04:33,292
干衣机里还有其他的裤子。
随便拿条穿上
There are other pants in the dryer.
Put on one of those.

87
00:04:33,334 --> 00:04:34,752
不！这就是我要的裤子！
No! These are the pants!

88
00:04:34,793 --> 00:04:36,712
不，你不能穿这条裤子，
弗兰克！
No, you are not wearing
those pants, Frank!

89
00:04:36,754 --> 00:04:40,341
- 你就像是野兽！
- 野兽根本都不喜欢裤子！
- You're just Iike an animaI!
- AnimaIs don't even Iike pants!

90
00:04:42,134 --> 00:04:44,219
- 你故意的！
- 我没有！
- You did that on purpose!
- I did not!

91
00:04:44,261 --> 00:04:46,430
你才是野兽！
You're the animaI!

92
00:04:51,393 --> 00:04:54,229
继续，亲爱的
Go on, dear.

93
00:04:58,442 --> 00:05:00,068
嘿！奶酪小傻傻
Hey! Cheese doodIe.

94
00:05:01,904 --> 00:05:06,200
我给孩子们星期六
的聚会订了充气跳跳房
I ordered a moon bounce
for the kids party Saturday.

95
00:05:06,241 --> 00:05:09,870
是个畜栏。
刚好配合牛仔的主题
It's a corraI.
Goes with your whoIe cowboy theme.

96
00:05:09,912 --> 00:05:11,955
他们说只有80磅
以下的才可以跳
They said you gotta be
under 80 pounds to jump in there,

97
00:05:11,997 --> 00:05:13,999
不过让他去死好了。
我是要跳的
but screw that guy.
I'm going in.

98
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:23,008
听着，雷
Listen, Ray.

99
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,470
- 什么？
- 我有事告诉你
- What?
- I have to teII you something.

100
00:05:26,512 --> 00:05:28,305
好吧
Yeah.

101
00:05:28,347 --> 00:05:31,058
很严重
It's pretty big.

102
00:05:31,058 --> 00:05:34,186
哦，天
Oh, boy.

103
00:05:34,228 --> 00:05:36,188
是啊
Yeah.

104
00:05:40,108 --> 00:05:42,903
我父母分居了
My parents
have separated.

105
00:05:42,945 --> 00:05:46,031
他们在走离婚的路
They're on the path
to divorce.

106
00:05:48,825 --> 00:05:51,203
- 你还笑？你还笑？
- 不不不不。不！
- You Iaugh? You Iaugh?!
- No no no no. No!

107
00:05:51,203 --> 00:05:53,539
只是有那么一刻，知道吗？
It's one of those
moments, you know?

108
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,625
太严肃了还是怎么的
It's too serious
or something.

109
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:58,502
我没准备好
I wasn't ready
for it.

110
00:05:58,544 --> 00:06:00,754
这太糟了
This is terribIe.

111
00:06:13,016 --> 00:06:14,726
不，好了，
No, aII right, st--

112
00:06:14,768 --> 00:06:16,895
没什么可笑的
There's nothing
funny here.

113
00:06:16,937 --> 00:06:18,856
这太可怕了。
你知道是为什么吗？
This is awfuI.
You know what it is.

114
00:06:18,897 --> 00:06:20,816
只是――只是你说的方式
It's just-- it's the way
that you said it.

115
00:06:20,858 --> 00:06:22,776
“他们在走离婚的路”
''They're on the path
to divorce.''

116
00:06:22,818 --> 00:06:25,737
我不是笑。我没有笑。
我没笑
I'm not smiIing. I didn't smiIe.
I'm not smiIing.

117
00:06:25,737 --> 00:06:27,698
你知道为什么吗？
是我想象的画面
You know what it is?
It's the image I have.

118
00:06:27,739 --> 00:06:29,575
我看到森林里一条小路，
I picture that there was
a path in the forest

119
00:06:29,616 --> 00:06:32,661
然后一个木牌子上写着：
“离婚走这边”然后――
with, Iike, one of those wooden signs.
''Divorce this way'' and--

120
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,121
我不知道。什么？
I don't know. What?

121
00:06:34,162 --> 00:06:37,082
――好像
“三只小猪，走这边”
--Iike ''Three IittIe pigs
this way.''

122
00:06:37,124 --> 00:06:38,834
然后你说的时候的脸色，
And then your face
when you said it,

123
00:06:38,876 --> 00:06:41,253
只是那有点严肃。
就是这样
it was just a IittIe serious.
That's aII.

124
00:06:41,295 --> 00:06:44,214
不！
No!

125
00:06:44,256 --> 00:06:46,216
我想我今天上班太开心了
I think I had too much
fun at work today.

126
00:06:46,216 --> 00:06:48,802
你知道贩售机怎么了？
贩售机的门，
You know what happened?
The door to the vending machine,

127
00:06:48,844 --> 00:06:51,138
坏掉了，明白了？
it was broken, see?

128
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,807
免费的糖果
Free candy.

129
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:55,809
这是我最喜欢的
These are my favorites.

130
00:06:56,977 --> 00:06:58,896
Twix（威化饼）
Twix.

131
00:07:59,654 --> 00:08:01,614
嘿
Hey.

132
00:08:03,241 --> 00:08:05,160
饿了？
Hungry?

133
00:08:05,201 --> 00:08:07,120
你知道，你要是有兴趣，
You know,
if you're interested,

134
00:08:07,162 --> 00:08:09,414
我楼上还有点糖果
I got a IittIe candy
Ieft upstairs.

135
00:08:21,342 --> 00:08:24,095
没事，我还有糖果
It's okay,
I got my candy.

136
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,850
你父母怎么了？
What happened
to your parents?

137
00:08:28,892 --> 00:08:31,519
干嘛，你还没笑够？
Why, you want
another good Iaugh?

138
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:34,481
我没笑
I didn't Iaugh.

139
00:08:34,522 --> 00:08:36,107
对不起
I'm sorry.

140
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:39,277
对不起。别这样，很遗憾你父母的事
I'm sorry. Come on, I'm sorry
about your parents.

141
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:41,863
这太糟了
It's very bad.

142
00:08:46,284 --> 00:08:49,329
对不起。
咱们得谈谈这事
I'm sorry.
We have to taIk about this.

143
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,748
我想跟你谈谈这事
I wanna taIk
about this with you.

144
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,917
来吧，咱们谈谈
Come on, we have to
discuss this.

145
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:57,420
那么，你爸妈，
So, your parents,

146
00:08:57,462 --> 00:08:59,589
乖乖……
boy...

147
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,802
- 说吧
- 唔，我不――
- Go ahead.
- WeII, I don't--

148
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:06,012
你能说什么呢？
我很遗憾
what do you say?
I'm sorry.

149
00:09:08,056 --> 00:09:11,017
可是，我的意思是，
我得说
But, I mean,
I have to say this.

150
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:13,770
我想大家都能看出
这天会来的
I think everybody couId have seen
this coming, right?

151
00:09:13,812 --> 00:09:17,315
我是说，还记得感恩节吧，
他们是怎么大喊大叫的？
I mean, remember Thanksgiving,
how they yeIIed?

152
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:21,903
这太可怕了。
我连派都要吃不下去了
It was terribIe.
I had a hard time finishing my pie.

153
00:09:21,945 --> 00:09:25,240
我知道他们有问题，雷
I know they had
probIems, Ray.

154
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:27,200
那你怎么这么吃惊？
Then why are you
so surprised?

155
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,536
因为他们是我父母！
他们要分手了！
Because they're my parents!
They're spIitting up!

156
00:09:29,577 --> 00:09:32,163
我不能相信的是
要离婚的是他们
What I can't beIieve is that
they're the ones getting a divorce.

157
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:33,832
应该是你父母才对
It shouId be your parents.

158
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:38,461
唔
WeII.

159
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:43,007
我不认为这是句友好的话
I don't think that's
a particuIarIy nice thing to say.

160
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,635
- 对不起
- 我想有人过分攀比了
- I'm sorry.
- I think someone's awfuIIy competitive.

161
00:09:45,677 --> 00:09:48,388
好吧，对不起，雷
AII right,
I'm sorry, Ray.

162
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,306
不，没关系
No, that's fine.

163
00:09:50,348 --> 00:09:53,393
关于我父母你想怎么说随便。
你平时也这样
Say what you want about my parents.
You usuaIIy do.

164
00:09:54,686 --> 00:09:56,938
不过我要说的是
But I wiII say this.

165
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,400
也许，也许你父母分手是因为
Maybe, maybe your parents
are spIitting up

166
00:10:00,442 --> 00:10:04,154
他们把事憋在心里太久，
because they kept
everything inside for so Iong

167
00:10:04,154 --> 00:10:07,031
直到最后爆发
that they finaIIy
just expIoded.

168
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:10,285
就像你把布丁杯放进微波炉
Like when you put a pudding cup
in the microwave.

169
00:10:13,455 --> 00:10:15,749
不是我干的，顺便说一句
Which was not me,
by the way.

170
00:10:19,002 --> 00:10:21,004
这么说这不让你担心
So this doesn't
worry you?

171
00:10:21,045 --> 00:10:24,883
- 什么？
- 咱们俩
- What?
- What about us.

172
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:29,262
- 什么意思？
- 要是咱们也变成那样呢？
- What do you mean?
- What if we're headed that way?

173
00:10:29,304 --> 00:10:32,056
我也有很多事闷在心里
I keep a Iot
of stuff inside, too.

174
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:35,477
不，你没有
No, you don't.

175
00:10:35,518 --> 00:10:37,479
我掉只袜子在地上，
I drop a sock
on the fIoor,

176
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:39,481
你叫得像恐怖片里一样
you scream Iike
a horror movie.

177
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:48,615
还有很多事我留在心里，
相信我
There's pIenty more I keep inside,
beIieve me.

178
00:10:48,656 --> 00:10:52,452
不可能有太多的
There can't be
a Iot Ieft in there.

179
00:10:53,828 --> 00:10:55,747
我恨我妈
I hate my mother.

180
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:58,750
不，你不恨。
你怎么知道是你妈的错？
No, you don't. How do you know
this is your mother's fauIt?

181
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,794
是她的错。
她太……
It's her fauIt.
She's so...

182
00:11:02,337 --> 00:11:04,631
她为什么这么做？
Why is she doing this?

183
00:11:04,672 --> 00:11:07,801
我是说，我父母在一起――
I mean, my parents
being together--

184
00:11:07,842 --> 00:11:10,970
我的意思是，
我这辈子就靠着这个了
I mean, I have counted
on that my whoIe Iife.

185
00:11:11,012 --> 00:11:12,680
从小学到大学，
Through schooI
and coIIege

186
00:11:12,722 --> 00:11:14,849
然后是大学毕业后的奋斗，
and then struggIing
after coIIege,

187
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:16,726
你知道，当我不知道自己做的什么，
you know, when I didn't
know what I was doing

188
00:11:16,768 --> 00:11:19,854
或者自己要去变成什么样，
至少我还有……
or where I was going,
at Ieast I had...

189
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:22,440
他们的婚姻就像是岩石，
Their marriage
was Iike a rock,

190
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:25,568
我的稳固的岩石
the one soIid rock
for me.

191
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,529
唔……
WeII...

192
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:31,533
也许那更像是个石头（结石），
好吗？
maybe it was more
Iike a stone, okay?

193
00:11:31,574 --> 00:11:33,827
现在排出来了
And now it has passed.

194
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,253
- 够了。真的够了
- 我做什么了？
- That's enough. That's just enough.
- What did I do?

195
00:11:43,253 --> 00:11:45,213
你就不能真正地谈话
You can't have
a reaI conversation.

196
00:11:45,213 --> 00:11:47,757
- 你非得逗笑。白痴
- 那也不是那么好笑了！
- You gotta be funny. Idiot.
- It wasn't that funny!

197
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:50,552
嘿，不，别这样。
看，我想要理解你，好吗？
Hey, no, come on, Iook, I'm trying
to be understanding here, okay?

198
00:11:50,593 --> 00:11:52,554
我可不是叫人白痴的人，
好吗？
I'm not the one who said ''idiot,''
aII right?

199
00:11:52,595 --> 00:11:55,640
不过我愿意不去计较，
因为我理解
But I'm wiIIing to overIook it
because I understand.

200
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,477
你是个家庭破碎的小孩
You're the chiId
of a broken home.

201
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:15,536
- 哦，嗨
- 嗨
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

202
00:12:18,414 --> 00:12:20,124
爱丽的手帕破了
AIIy's kerchief tore.

203
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,334
是吗
Yeah.

204
00:12:22,376 --> 00:12:25,337
唔，她需要另一条
WeII, she needs
another one to go

205
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:28,257
来配她的牛仔装扮
with her
cowgirI ensembIe.

206
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:30,217
好的，我去拿
Okay, I'II get it.

207
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:32,511
黛比拉，等等
Debra, wait.

208
00:12:32,553 --> 00:12:34,346
什么？
What?

209
00:12:34,346 --> 00:12:37,183
我不知道。
我只希望也许
I don't know.
I was just hoping that maybe

210
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:40,478
你过去两天能够
you couId have tried to come
to terms with the situation

211
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:43,022
- 试着接受现状
- 不，我没事，妈，
- over the Iast coupIe of days.
- No, I'm fine, Mom,

212
00:12:43,064 --> 00:12:46,484
不过谢谢你给我
两天时间来接受
but thanks for the coupIe of days
to come to terms with it.

213
00:12:46,525 --> 00:12:49,403
我得去拿手帕了
I gotta get
that kerchief.

214
00:12:51,363 --> 00:12:53,324
别缠着我！
Leave me aIone!

215
00:12:55,326 --> 00:12:57,328
别这样！
Come on!

216
00:12:57,369 --> 00:13:00,081
咱们说过了的。
我是坏蛋
We said it before.
I'm the bad guy.

217
00:13:00,122 --> 00:13:01,957
你说的。我没同意
You said that.
I did not agree to that.

218
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:04,001
唔，总不能有两个坏蛋吧，
好吗？
WeII, there can't
be two bad guys, okay?

219
00:13:04,043 --> 00:13:07,379
- 这说不通
- 看，我想做坏蛋，好吗？
- That doesn't make sense.
- Look, I wanna be the bad guy, okay?

220
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:09,632
我总是好人。
我是警察
I'm aIways a good guy.
I'm a cop.

221
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,552
这太单调了
It's monotonous.

222
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:16,055
听着，胡子是我买的
Listen,
I bought the mustache.

223
00:13:16,097 --> 00:13:18,724
是，唔，这是我孩子的聚会，好吗？
他们都恨好人
Yeah, weII, it's my kid's party, okay?
They aII hate the good guy.

224
00:13:18,766 --> 00:13:20,684
那么你正需要点恨
So you couId use
a IittIe hate.

225
00:13:20,726 --> 00:13:23,270
你知道吗？
You know what?

226
00:13:23,312 --> 00:13:25,356
啊！
Aah!

227
00:13:25,398 --> 00:13:29,026
丑恶雷蒙德来了！
It's Rotten Raymond!

228
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:33,447
他真有趣
He's so funny.

229
00:13:33,489 --> 00:13:35,491
是的，他是好人
Yeah, he's a pip.

230
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:45,209
听着，我很遗憾听说你和华伦的事
Listen, I was sorry to hear
about you and Warren.

231
00:13:45,251 --> 00:13:47,211
谢谢
Thank you.

232
00:13:47,211 --> 00:13:49,088
我有过亲身经历
I've been there.

233
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,882
没错
That's right.

234
00:13:51,924 --> 00:13:53,926
你妻子叫什么来的？
What was your wife's
name again?

235
00:13:53,968 --> 00:13:57,471
乔安。实际上她很可怕
Joanne. She was actuaIIy
quite horribIe.

236
00:13:59,473 --> 00:14:01,559
是的，我记得
Right, I remember.

237
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,937
告诉你吧，
时间会冲淡一切的
Just so you know,
it gets better as time passes.

238
00:14:04,937 --> 00:14:06,647
知道吗？
You know?

239
00:14:06,689 --> 00:14:08,858
谢谢，罗伯特
Thank you, Robert.

240
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:12,403
实际上，我们现在接受得很好
ActuaIIy, we're pretty
okay with it now.

241
00:14:12,445 --> 00:14:15,948
是吗，乔安也一样
Yeah, so was Joanne.

242
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,868
她还办了聚会
She had a party.

243
00:14:18,868 --> 00:14:22,455
- 哦？
- 在她原来的脱衣舞俱乐部
- Oh?
- At her oId strip cIub.

244
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:24,665
她的朋友都在那――
AII her friends
were there--

245
00:14:24,707 --> 00:14:27,877
丝缎、泡泡、
Satin, BubbIes,

246
00:14:27,918 --> 00:14:29,879
小舔舔
Lick-Lick.

247
00:14:40,806 --> 00:14:42,767
人会犯错误
PeopIe make mistakes.

248
00:14:45,102 --> 00:14:48,939
我会说她才是犯错误的人
I wouId say she's the one
that made the mistake.

249
00:14:50,191 --> 00:14:51,859
谢谢
Thank you.

250
00:15:03,412 --> 00:15:05,456
哦，听着
Oh, Iisten.

251
00:15:05,498 --> 00:15:08,876
- 不，我只是想安慰你
- 祝你好运
- No, I was just trying to be consoIing.
- Good Iuck to you.

252
00:15:08,876 --> 00:15:11,879
- 不，我不是想――
- 祝你好运！
- No, I didn't mean--
- Good Iuck to you!

253
00:15:14,215 --> 00:15:17,426
对不起。
可他真的疯了
I'm sorry.
He reaIIy is crazy.

254
00:15:21,514 --> 00:15:23,891
该死！愚蠢见鬼该死的东西
Damn it! Stupid damn
friggin' thing.

255
00:15:23,933 --> 00:15:25,851
黛比拉
Debra.

256
00:15:27,895 --> 00:15:30,231
你妈说你在上面
Your mom said
you were up here.

257
00:15:31,816 --> 00:15:33,818
嗨，爸爸
Hi, Dad.

258
00:15:39,156 --> 00:15:42,785
我找不到手帕了
I can't find a kerchief.

259
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:53,379
你在这干嘛？
What are you doing here?

260
00:15:53,421 --> 00:15:56,382
唔，请柬上写的：
“大家来生日聚会了”
WeII, the invitation said
''Round 'em up birthday party.''

261
00:15:56,424 --> 00:15:59,427
保证了有“嘈杂火热的时光”的
It promised a ''rootin' tootin' time.''

262
00:15:59,468 --> 00:16:02,138
我真难过，爸爸
I'm so sorry, Dad.

263
00:16:02,179 --> 00:16:03,514
是啊，我也是
Yeah, me, too.

264
00:16:03,556 --> 00:16:05,850
对不起她这么对你
Sorry she's
doing this to you.

265
00:16:05,891 --> 00:16:09,895
- 什么意思？
- 我知道她是什么样子
- What do you mean?
- I know how she is.

266
00:16:13,107 --> 00:16:15,526
来，坐下
Here, sit down.

267
00:16:17,194 --> 00:16:19,113
这不是你妈的错
This is not
your mother's fauIt.

268
00:16:19,155 --> 00:16:21,699
- 别替她说话
- 听我说
- Don't you defend her.
- Listen to me.

269
00:16:22,867 --> 00:16:24,952
我们都有一段时间不开心了
We have both been unhappy

270
00:16:24,994 --> 00:16:27,163
- 你知道的
- 好吧，
- for some time now. You know that.
- AII right,

271
00:16:27,204 --> 00:16:29,623
可你至少想要努力
but you're the one
who at Ieast tries to make an effort,

272
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:31,917
比如想去那个婚姻咨询
Iike wanting to go
to that marriage counseIing.

273
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:34,754
我能告诉你吗？
我从没真的想去新泽西
Can I teII you something? I never reaIIy
wanted to go to New Jersey.

274
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:36,797
你想知道我为什么选那吗？
You want to know
why I picked that pIace?

275
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:38,758
因为我想看到的是
Because I was
Iooking forward

276
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:41,719
你妈怎么恨那的
to how much your Mother
wouId hate it.

277
00:16:43,512 --> 00:16:44,930
唔，她喜欢那里，
WeII, she Ioved it,

278
00:16:44,972 --> 00:16:48,559
而我则闷的头骨都要裂开了
and I was the one bored
out of my freakin' skuII.

279
00:16:48,601 --> 00:16:50,519
那些个讨论会――
Those workshops--

280
00:16:50,561 --> 00:16:54,231
“升华你灵魂伴侣的灵魂”
''PoIishing your
souI mate's souI.''

281
00:16:54,273 --> 00:16:55,941
所以……
So...

282
00:16:55,983 --> 00:16:58,194
你真的不该怪你母亲，宝贝
You reaIIy mustn't bIame
your mother, honey.

283
00:16:58,235 --> 00:17:01,655
是我说的结束了
I'm the one who actuaIIy
said it was over.

284
00:17:01,697 --> 00:17:04,116
我不相信
I don't beIieve it.

285
00:17:04,158 --> 00:17:07,870
- 是真的
- 她说了什么？
- It's true.
- And what did she say?

286
00:17:08,871 --> 00:17:11,123
唔，她知道
WeII, she knew.

287
00:17:11,123 --> 00:17:13,584
我们都知道
We both knew.

288
00:17:16,879 --> 00:17:18,798
别哭，宝贝
Don't cry, honey.

289
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,258
我忍不住
I can't heIp it.

290
00:17:21,258 --> 00:17:23,594
我是说，如果你们不是认真的，
I mean, why the heII
do you take vows

291
00:17:23,636 --> 00:17:25,971
干嘛当初要发誓呢？
if they don't mean
anything?

292
00:17:26,013 --> 00:17:27,848
我们那时是认真的
We meant it then.

293
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:30,601
你们小时候
我们也是认真的
We meant it
when you were kids.

294
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:35,648
可是当你和你姐姐去上大学，
But when your sister and then you
went off to coIIege,

295
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:38,234
就越来越难了
it kept getting harder.

296
00:17:38,275 --> 00:17:41,237
唔，那亲来亲去、
一起旅行、
WeII, what about aII the kissing,
the traveIing together

297
00:17:41,278 --> 00:17:43,989
车牌取名Pookums 1号2号
又是怎么回事？
and the Pookums 1 and 2
Iicense pIates?

298
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:46,992
这算什么？
What was that?

299
00:17:47,034 --> 00:17:49,328
我知道，我知道
I know. I know.

300
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:52,289
我猜，到最后，
I guess, by the end,

301
00:17:52,331 --> 00:17:56,168
大多数时候都是演戏
most of that was
just... a show.

302
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,880
而我们受够了
And we had enough.

303
00:17:59,922 --> 00:18:01,841
我们俩都受够了
We both had enough.

304
00:18:06,637 --> 00:18:08,597
不像雷的父母
It's not Iike
Ray's parents.

305
00:18:10,683 --> 00:18:12,727
什么？
What?

306
00:18:12,768 --> 00:18:15,062
他们好像掌握了个中奥秘
They seem
to have the secret.

307
00:18:15,104 --> 00:18:17,064
什么？
What?

308
00:18:18,149 --> 00:18:20,443
他们知道怎么做
They know how
to do it.

309
00:18:20,484 --> 00:18:22,820
不用装门面
It's not a facade
for them.

310
00:18:22,862 --> 00:18:25,364
可他们是疯子
But they're maniacs.

311
00:18:27,825 --> 00:18:30,578
是的，但他们彼此真诚
Yes, but they're honest
with each other.

312
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:33,414
什么事都能敞开了说
Everything's out
in the open with them.

313
00:18:33,456 --> 00:18:36,083
“蛋，玛丽，
别叨叨”
''Eggs, Marie,
and hoId the chatter.''

314
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,085
我喜欢那个
I Iove that.

315
00:18:40,379 --> 00:18:42,339
我告诉你，
他们才是
I'II teII you,
they're the ones

316
00:18:42,339 --> 00:18:44,800
该去作报告的人
who oughta be
giving the seminar.

317
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,168
你好呀
Howdy.

318
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:14,089
能把那个摘下来吗？
WouId you take
that off, pIease?

319
00:19:14,131 --> 00:19:16,091
是，夫人
Yes, Ma'am.

320
00:19:28,353 --> 00:19:30,480
觉得好些了吗？
FeeIing any better?

321
00:19:30,522 --> 00:19:32,482
我猜是的
I guess.

322
00:19:34,902 --> 00:19:38,197
真遗憾你的父母
Sorry about your parents.

323
00:19:38,238 --> 00:19:40,157
我知道
I know.

324
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,327
可是你知道……
But you know...

325
00:19:43,368 --> 00:19:45,537
咱们不会那样的
that's not us.

326
00:19:45,579 --> 00:19:47,998
因为我――
'Cause I--

327
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,792
我想咱们差不多
什么事都说出来了
I think we kinda get
everything out in the open.

328
00:19:58,425 --> 00:20:00,385
紧点
Tighter.

329
00:20:03,472 --> 00:20:05,432
再紧些
Tighter.

330
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,191
你想我把胡子戴上吗？
You want me
to put on the mustache?

331
00:20:20,656 --> 00:20:25,244
