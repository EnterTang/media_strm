2
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:20,209
Hey, quit looking at that.

3
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:24,292
Stop reading.

4
00:02:25,751 --> 00:02:28,251
I'm searching for other fun places to sight see.

5
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:29,917
For our next trip.

6
00:02:30,376 --> 00:02:32,084
This guide is not meant for you.

7
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:34,542
It's written for people who's clueless
about traveling.

8
00:02:35,126 --> 00:02:37,292
Where do you fancy going? I'll take you.

9
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:40,042
I have no clue precisely.

10
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:41,251
That's why I'm brushing up.

11
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:42,876
Up to you.

12
00:02:55,251 --> 00:02:56,667
You're better looking photographed.

13
00:03:00,292 --> 00:03:01,667
Really? No kidding.

14
00:03:02,126 --> 00:03:04,917
It's a great photo. Who took it for you?

15
00:03:06,501 --> 00:03:08,542
Someone.

16
00:03:09,126 --> 00:03:10,834
Of course, someone.

17
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:15,876
I'm asking who.

18
00:03:16,626 --> 00:03:18,292
What does it matter who?

19
00:03:18,626 --> 00:03:20,667
So many trips I took. How can I remember?

20
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:23,792
Couldn't even remember the person you were with?

21
00:03:24,917 --> 00:03:26,834
I've taken trips with so many people.

22
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:28,501
I'll have memory overload if I remember everyone.

23
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:29,417
This isn't exactly...

24
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,417
your first trip going with someone.

25
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:35,709
It's actually my first time.

26
00:03:36,126 --> 00:03:38,292
I quit my job to accompany you.

27
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:41,084
Nobody asked you to quit your job.

28
00:03:41,251 --> 00:03:42,167
You were unhappy with it.

29
00:03:42,334 --> 00:03:44,417
- I did it on purpose
- Playing the Stewardess of course not

30
00:03:45,334 --> 00:03:47,417
I was sexually harassed by the editor.

31
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:49,959
Andrew? He seems gay.

32
00:03:50,376 --> 00:03:51,084
Some drinks

33
00:03:51,376 --> 00:03:53,209
Forget it. No need to dwell on aggravations.

34
00:03:54,042 --> 00:03:55,626
Whole point of holidays is pleasure seeking.

35
00:03:56,084 --> 00:03:57,042
You like to order?

36
00:03:58,209 --> 00:03:59,084
Coffee. Thanks.

37
00:03:59,334 --> 00:04:00,501
A glass of water please.

38
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:01,584
Thank you.

39
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:06,542
Right, trips are suppose to be fun.

40
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:08,501
Look at you. So happy.

41
00:04:09,126 --> 00:04:10,417
How can you not remember?

42
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,751
Is it not allowed?

43
00:04:14,126 --> 00:04:15,584
Even if you can remember, don't let me know.

44
00:04:15,751 --> 00:04:17,376
You don't have to know if you don't ask.

45
00:04:17,917 --> 00:04:19,459
I wouldn't have to ask if you didn't do it.

46
00:04:20,626 --> 00:04:21,751
What have I done?

47
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:23,834
You know very well what you did.

48
00:04:25,126 --> 00:04:26,042
That's a joke.

49
00:04:26,334 --> 00:04:27,167
What did I do that...

50
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:28,917
you know about and I don't?

51
00:04:29,251 --> 00:04:32,167
Why not ask yourself
what you don't want me to know.

52
00:04:33,042 --> 00:04:34,501
Don't want you to know?

53
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,542
Why not just come out and say what you know?

54
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:44,209
Country code for Australia is 614, right?

55
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:45,376
I guess so...

56
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:46,626
You guess so?

57
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:49,126
So it was she who called.

58
00:04:50,084 --> 00:04:51,584
You're snooping around my phone?

59
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:53,001
Can't help if the screen's so gigantic.

60
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,292
No need to peek if it's visible for miles around.

61
00:04:55,459 --> 00:04:57,167
Don't you know about privacy rights?

62
00:04:58,292 --> 00:04:59,959
- I have the feeling...
- Big screens don't give you license to snoop.

63
00:05:00,126 --> 00:05:02,126
...the man's hiding something.

64
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:06,459
Don't be such a busybody.

65
00:05:06,917 --> 00:05:09,917
Curious to see if his screen is really that big.

66
00:05:13,292 --> 00:05:15,292
If it's you, how will you answer?

67
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:22,292
I won't say anything.

68
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:24,792
So you're still in touch.

69
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,917
Breaking up doesn't mean the end of friendship.

70
00:05:28,126 --> 00:05:29,542
What's wrong about friends caring for each other?

71
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:32,376
How can you still be friends after splitting up?

72
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,167
Is it possible to be friends after a break-up?

73
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:39,084
Depends on who.

74
00:05:42,417 --> 00:05:44,001
If it's you, very unlikely.

75
00:05:45,376 --> 00:05:46,501
Why?

76
00:05:46,876 --> 00:05:48,417
Am I that terrible?

77
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:55,667
I mean I don't intent to break up with you.

78
00:05:57,667 --> 00:05:58,834
It's you who can't be friends.

79
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:00,709
Doesn't mean the same for others.

80
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:02,542
You and your attitude.

81
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:05,251
How can any of your ex be friends with you?

82
00:06:07,084 --> 00:06:08,667
It's not a matter of being close,

83
00:06:08,876 --> 00:06:10,792
it's how close you intend to be.

84
00:06:11,251 --> 00:06:13,042
She's very straightforward.

85
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:15,209
Outspoken as always.

86
00:06:17,084 --> 00:06:18,209
You know her?

87
00:06:21,084 --> 00:06:23,292
Oh, she's Zhou Yi.

88
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:25,542
So, did she or didn't she?

89
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:28,001
If it's you, will you admit to it?

90
00:06:29,417 --> 00:06:32,709
What does it matter if she did or not?

91
00:06:35,126 --> 00:06:37,376
I'm sorry. We were plastered...

92
00:06:37,626 --> 00:06:39,709
Saying sorry doesn't make you right.

93
00:06:40,751 --> 00:06:42,792
- Stop it. There's people around.
- Leave me alone.

94
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:44,876
Listen to me.

95
00:06:45,292 --> 00:06:46,626
Sit down first.

96
00:06:47,251 --> 00:06:48,251
Let's split.

97
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:51,542
I already apologized. What do you want?

98
00:06:51,751 --> 00:06:52,917
Go our separate ways.

99
00:06:55,584 --> 00:06:56,876
You want to split, split.

100
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,542
Why do you need to throw things?

101
00:07:42,584 --> 00:07:46,126
Sorry, I thought he was going to hit you.

102
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,542
Lucky she didn't hit anyone first.

103
00:07:50,542 --> 00:07:53,126
Just drop me where I can catch a cab.

104
00:07:53,334 --> 00:07:54,667
Anywhere convenient to get off.

105
00:07:54,834 --> 00:07:56,251
It's good to know when to get off.

106
00:07:56,417 --> 00:07:57,709
Know the meaning of troublesome?

107
00:07:57,917 --> 00:07:59,626
It's OK. No trouble giving you a lift.

108
00:07:59,792 --> 00:08:01,459
Right. it's not you who's driving.

109
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:03,126
So? Haven't got your driver's license?

110
00:08:03,292 --> 00:08:04,876
He failed twice.

111
00:08:05,042 --> 00:08:07,501
It's OK. I don't mind driving.

112
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:10,334
Twice? That makes it five failures total.

113
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:11,792
You're something else.

114
00:08:14,876 --> 00:08:17,251
Right, didn't get your name...you're...

115
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:18,667
I'm Cee.

116
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:20,876
Funny, I'm B.

117
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:25,459
Just kidding. I'm Zhou Yi.

118
00:08:26,084 --> 00:08:28,001
I know. Ping has mentioned you before.

119
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:31,376
Bet it's nothing complimentary.

120
00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:33,167
Who has time to talk about you?

121
00:08:46,334 --> 00:08:47,209
Not this apartment?

122
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:49,667
People are asleep. Quiet.

123
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:53,792
Miss Lin...Miss Lin...

124
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:55,376
Get up, Miss Lin.

125
00:08:56,126 --> 00:08:57,001
What?

126
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:57,667
Miss Lin.

127
00:08:57,834 --> 00:08:58,834
You again?

128
00:08:59,001 --> 00:09:01,167
Miss Zhou, what time is it?

129
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,001
What do you want?

130
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:05,126
Sorry. A mishap.

131
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:06,917
I like to continue renting.

132
00:09:08,334 --> 00:09:11,084
Wasn't it your idea to break the lease?

133
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:13,876
I've already returned all your deposit.

134
00:09:14,042 --> 00:09:14,792
What the hell do you want now?

135
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,084
I beg you, another year.

136
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:17,917
My purse...

137
00:09:18,084 --> 00:09:20,251
Normally, you call me Fat Arse right?

138
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:21,042
Not true.

139
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:23,834
Now it's Miss Lin this and Miss Lin that.

140
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:26,126
First you say go, then you say rent.

141
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:28,251
And if you impulsively take flight again?

142
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:29,834
What should I do? Return the rent?

143
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:31,042
No way.

144
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:33,334
- it's not that, Miss Lin...
- Mind your hands.

145
00:09:33,626 --> 00:09:35,876
Miss Lin, you have similar units available?

146
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,667
- You can rent me?
- What happened to Mr. Mustache?

147
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:39,209
Switch to Mr. Spectacles?

148
00:09:39,376 --> 00:09:41,042
Now a threesome.

149
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:44,709
Have you considered love motels instead?

150
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,001
Wake up, check out.

151
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:47,834
No need to clean up after yourselves.

152
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:49,167
Meaning what?

153
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:51,917
Good suggestion.

154
00:09:52,251 --> 00:09:53,376
Thank you.

155
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:54,709
Don't mention it.

156
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:57,834
Hey...

157
00:10:00,126 --> 00:10:01,126
So, now what?

158
00:10:02,084 --> 00:10:03,084
How do I know?

159
00:10:05,542 --> 00:10:06,501
What now?

160
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:10,376
Can't find my passport and my purse.

161
00:10:14,876 --> 00:10:15,959
Maybe your boyfriend has them?

162
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:20,584
Babe, I'm in San Diego.

163
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:22,626
I just checked in.

164
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:24,667
Aren't you going to England?

165
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:27,834
Last minute change of plans.

166
00:10:28,917 --> 00:10:31,042
What's your next stop? Are you coming back?

167
00:10:31,626 --> 00:10:35,251
Next stop Japan. Looking up friends.

168
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:38,376
Don't go. Come back first.

169
00:10:38,626 --> 00:10:41,876
I'm penniless. Someone took my passport.

170
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:43,084
I've given up my apartment.

171
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:44,834
Don't have any place to go.

172
00:10:45,001 --> 00:10:47,792
Even then, it will take me
over 30 hours to get back.

173
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:49,792
Where are you? You're in a dive?

174
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:52,292
What dive? I'm on the street.

175
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:55,251
A friend gave me a lift from the airport.

176
00:10:55,417 --> 00:10:56,292
What friend?

177
00:10:56,584 --> 00:10:59,501
The one who kept failing the driver's test.

178
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:02,001
How many times did he take the test?

179
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:03,084
Five times.

180
00:11:03,251 --> 00:11:05,959
Shame! I have to go.

181
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:07,334
Call you when I get back.

182
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,292
Alright, bye.

183
00:11:10,292 --> 00:11:12,751
Mum says she can't make it back.

184
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:16,542
It'll take 30 hours. We heard.

185
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:18,292
You overheard that?

186
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:22,001
Your phone was on really loud.

187
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:23,417
That so?

188
00:11:23,584 --> 00:11:25,167
Something wrong with your ears?

189
00:11:26,126 --> 00:11:28,292
It's itchy. Maybe an infection.

190
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:29,667
Don't worry about it.

191
00:11:34,001 --> 00:11:37,751
Jolin, can I crash your place for a few days?

192
00:11:38,376 --> 00:11:41,167
Never mind. You take care.

193
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:42,167
What?

194
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:44,834
Battery low.

195
00:11:45,626 --> 00:11:46,751
Sorry.

196
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:49,876
So...now what?

197
00:11:59,084 --> 00:12:00,876
Off, shoes off...

198
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,584
Wow, how big is this?

199
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:09,542
800 square feet.

200
00:12:11,251 --> 00:12:12,042
You're sharing?

201
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:14,251
He's renting. I'm just bunking.

202
00:12:15,376 --> 00:12:17,876
I know I'm a nuisance but I'll clear out soon.

203
00:12:18,542 --> 00:12:20,459
It's his flat. I don't mind.

204
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:23,584
Once my Mom returns, I'll leave.

205
00:12:24,626 --> 00:12:26,376
Not thinking of a long stay, are you?

206
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:27,876
Didn't I say I'll leave right away.

207
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:32,251
Do you really need such a big lamp?

208
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:35,209
It's antique. Landlord says can't take it down.

209
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:38,167
It's pretty. Why hide it behind a lampshade?

210
00:12:38,334 --> 00:12:39,334
Doesn't match.

211
00:12:39,751 --> 00:12:41,959
It agrees with you.

212
00:12:42,126 --> 00:12:43,542
- You're so materialistic. - Don't touch.

213
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:46,042
You have no say. This is my flat.

214
00:12:46,376 --> 00:12:49,292
Your flat? You're just a tenant.

215
00:12:53,001 --> 00:12:55,834
I'm tired. I'll bunk here.

216
00:12:56,001 --> 00:12:57,209
Don't worry about me.

217
00:12:57,917 --> 00:12:59,126
You really making yourself at home!

218
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:01,167
Sleep in the study.

219
00:13:02,001 --> 00:13:03,709
Study? You're kidding me.

220
00:13:03,876 --> 00:13:06,084
Chen Jun Ping, you must be kidding.

221
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,001
Don't tear it apart.

222
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:21,959
It's late. She's a lone girl by herself.

223
00:13:23,084 --> 00:13:24,584
Can't expect her to go to a love motel.

224
00:13:25,751 --> 00:13:28,209
Did I say anything? It's fine.

225
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:32,459
Zhou Yi. I'll get you a change of clothes.

226
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:33,709
Thanks.

227
00:13:43,376 --> 00:13:44,376
Top...pants.

228
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:46,292
- Rest well. - Thanks.

229
00:13:50,792 --> 00:13:54,334
Wash first. You're dirtying the sheets.

230
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,292
I'm too tired.

231
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:57,667
You're spreading fleas.

232
00:13:58,167 --> 00:13:59,501
Spread fleas?

233
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:00,376
Hurry up!

234
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:03,001
There's fleas? Is this where they're hiding?

235
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:04,084
Stop it.

236
00:14:04,251 --> 00:14:06,376
Let me scratch. Is it here?

237
00:14:30,417 --> 00:14:32,459
Excuse me. I was hungry.

238
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:35,334
Do you want eggs?

239
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,292
Sure. You want some?

240
00:14:37,584 --> 00:14:38,917
No. I'm on diet.

241
00:14:39,084 --> 00:14:40,292
You don't look like you need to.

242
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:41,917
Thanks.

243
00:14:46,292 --> 00:14:46,792
What?

244
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:47,542
For frying.

245
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:48,917
No need.

246
00:14:51,292 --> 00:14:52,209
Just do this.

247
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:53,792
- Let me. - Thanks.

248
00:14:55,084 --> 00:14:57,626
You've known each other long?

249
00:14:57,959 --> 00:14:59,042
Chen Jun Ping?

250
00:15:00,126 --> 00:15:02,209
A few years. Almost six.

251
00:15:05,084 --> 00:15:07,376
There's nothing between us now.

252
00:15:12,876 --> 00:15:13,667
You sure you don't want some?

253
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:15,751
No thanks, we don't have the habit
of midnight snacking.

254
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:20,376
What?

255
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:22,209
Nothing.

256
00:15:22,876 --> 00:15:24,917
I'll turn in now. Take your time.

257
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:26,834
- Good night. - Night.

258
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:47,417
Do I have to keep repeating?

259
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:49,376
Keep the shower curtain inside the tub.

260
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:50,376
- Spilling water all over. - I'm late.

261
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:51,834
Can't drop you off work.

262
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:53,126
Why are you in here?

263
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:53,751
Nothing you haven't seen before.

264
00:16:53,917 --> 00:16:56,251
Your hand's filthy. Don't touch my lips. Out!

265
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:01,126
Use to put it in your mouth. Was it hygienic then?

266
00:17:21,501 --> 00:17:24,251
I need to shower and hurry to work.

267
00:17:25,584 --> 00:17:27,209
Wash your stuff later, OK?

268
00:18:34,084 --> 00:18:35,959
It's killing me!

269
00:18:40,001 --> 00:18:41,126
Are you alright?

270
00:18:42,292 --> 00:18:46,376
It hurts. Get me some pain-killers
and sanitary napkins.

271
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:49,667
Me? How?

272
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:53,084
Buying sanitary napkins! I'll be a laughing stock.

273
00:18:53,792 --> 00:18:55,959
I'll do you a favor.

274
00:18:57,126 --> 00:18:58,126
Stuff this in first as a stop gap.

275
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:02,209
Stuff your ass! Hurry up.

276
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:03,001
Is it really painful?

277
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:04,917
Let me kick you in the groins.

278
00:19:05,084 --> 00:19:06,417
See if it hurts.

279
00:19:06,584 --> 00:19:07,376
Will I still have to go...

280
00:19:07,542 --> 00:19:09,084
if I let you kick me?

281
00:19:10,459 --> 00:19:11,042
Just kidding.

282
00:19:11,209 --> 00:19:13,167
Fine. I'm on my way.

283
00:19:13,334 --> 00:19:14,751
Also "Bang" killers.

284
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:15,501
"Bang"killers'?

285
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:17,251
Pain-killers!

286
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:18,709
Back in a jiffy.

287
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:29,876
Here. Stem the flow.

288
00:19:38,834 --> 00:19:40,292
What the heck?

289
00:19:41,459 --> 00:19:42,626
What's wrong?

290
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:44,376
A grown man...

291
00:19:44,542 --> 00:19:47,251
and can't tell a sanitary napkin from a pad?

292
00:19:48,501 --> 00:19:51,042
What good does it do a man
to know things like that?

293
00:19:51,501 --> 00:19:52,876
Isn't it almost the same?

294
00:19:56,917 --> 00:19:58,001
Are you alright?

295
00:20:00,792 --> 00:20:03,667
Need to get to the hospital
for a shot of tranquilizer.

296
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:05,626
That bad?

297
00:20:07,292 --> 00:20:08,376
I'll call an ambulance.

298
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,001
You're letting the whole village know?

299
00:20:14,334 --> 00:20:16,542
An ambulance due to menstruation. How shameful!

300
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:19,209
What a nuisance.

301
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:35,042
Easy does it.

302
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:39,167
Can we afford to Calla cab here?

303
00:20:40,251 --> 00:20:42,334
Doesn't cost us. Sol is a buddy.

304
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:43,542
Hi!

305
00:20:43,751 --> 00:20:44,376
His family runs a fleet of taxis.

306
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:45,584
Howdy!

307
00:20:46,376 --> 00:20:47,459
This taxi is for private use.

308
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:49,542
You're the only one uses it like a private car.

309
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:51,501
What happened?

310
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:52,959
Her period.

311
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:54,667
Get in.

312
00:20:56,084 --> 00:20:58,167
Forgot my I.D.

313
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:00,792
Hold her a sec.

314
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,542
- OK. - OK. OK.

315
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:03,751
I'm ticklish.

316
00:21:04,376 --> 00:21:05,709
I'm sorry.

317
00:21:05,876 --> 00:21:08,126
Get in first. Mind your head.

318
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:22,001
I'm off to work.

319
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:24,417
Keys on the cabinet. Help yourself.

320
00:21:25,001 --> 00:21:26,251
Can I use your computer?

321
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:29,709
My laptop's batteries ran out.
Charger's with my luggage.

322
00:21:29,917 --> 00:21:32,417
Sure. Always never bother to ask first.

323
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,209
What's the password?

324
00:21:46,501 --> 00:21:48,209
Still using the same old one.

325
00:21:48,417 --> 00:21:49,459
What's it to you?

326
00:21:55,209 --> 00:21:56,209
Look at this.

327
00:21:57,626 --> 00:21:59,167
Your Mom's really traveled all over.

328
00:21:59,459 --> 00:22:00,792
What kind of obsession is that?

329
00:22:01,084 --> 00:22:02,792
Taking pictures of bedrooms solely.

330
00:22:03,501 --> 00:22:05,292
Can I give Woody your address?

331
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:07,001
So that he can forward my stuff?

332
00:22:07,167 --> 00:22:08,292
Sure.

333
00:22:09,167 --> 00:22:11,792
You're sure he'll send it all back to you .

334
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:13,292
Think so.

335
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:16,042
What's your address?

336
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:26,334
After me, was it just Woody?

337
00:22:29,084 --> 00:22:33,751
No, there's Ben, Oscar...

338
00:22:34,209 --> 00:22:35,667
Then Woody.

339
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:38,209
After me was it just Cee?

340
00:22:41,459 --> 00:22:42,667
No.

341
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:45,584
There's Kitty, Pat, Rachel.

342
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:47,126
Then Cee.

343
00:22:47,292 --> 00:22:49,001
Not the Rachel with the body odor?

344
00:22:51,292 --> 00:22:52,667
No, that's Rachel Ma.

345
00:22:53,209 --> 00:22:55,084
Mine was Rachel Chan.

346
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,001
I know this girl.

347
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,126
Charlie?

348
00:22:58,292 --> 00:22:59,251
Yeah.

349
00:22:59,501 --> 00:23:01,334
A co-worker at the publishing house.

350
00:23:01,834 --> 00:23:03,334
Don't tell me you went with her.

351
00:23:05,542 --> 00:23:06,792
Think I'm as promiscuous as you?

352
00:23:08,376 --> 00:23:10,209
Can you believe she use to go with Sol?

353
00:23:10,376 --> 00:23:12,542
What? They're still an item.

354
00:23:12,709 --> 00:23:13,626
How do you know?

355
00:23:14,542 --> 00:23:17,376
I took her to see Sol's band perform.

356
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:18,834
She's now an adoring fan.

357
00:23:19,042 --> 00:23:21,709
Bastard! Does musicians have it easier with girls?

358
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,542
He invites you to his performances?

359
00:23:25,626 --> 00:23:27,251
He often leaves me tickets.

360
00:23:28,251 --> 00:23:29,126
How come I never run into you?

361
00:23:29,376 --> 00:23:30,709
I know when to avoid you.

362
00:23:42,751 --> 00:23:43,876
Thanks.

363
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:46,542
What?

364
00:23:47,542 --> 00:23:48,501
Thank you.

365
00:23:49,167 --> 00:23:50,751
Come again.

366
00:23:51,417 --> 00:23:52,751
I said thanks.

367
00:23:58,459 --> 00:23:59,751
Aren't you in a hurry?

368
00:24:47,376 --> 00:24:48,459
There's stains.

369
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:50,501
- What? - Didn't wash off.

370
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:51,876
What?

371
00:24:53,042 --> 00:24:54,459
Look for yourself.

372
00:24:58,084 --> 00:25:00,042
No. Come here.

373
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:02,167
Quick. Over here.

374
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:06,167
Look.

375
00:25:06,917 --> 00:25:08,626
Like a heart?

376
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:10,001
Looks alike.

377
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:11,251
Aren't you ashamed?

378
00:25:12,001 --> 00:25:12,959
It's a copy.

379
00:25:13,417 --> 00:25:15,167
Next time is it possible for you...

380
00:25:15,376 --> 00:25:16,667
...to add a star here?

381
00:25:19,376 --> 00:25:20,251
Sure.

382
00:25:31,459 --> 00:25:32,417
Hey, Andrew.

383
00:25:33,251 --> 00:25:34,376
What are you doing back here?

384
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:39,209
You're formidable. Snaring a writer.

385
00:25:39,376 --> 00:25:40,417
Aren't you on a trip with Woody?

386
00:25:41,709 --> 00:25:43,292
Unexpected change of plans.

387
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,834
Change of plans or companion?

388
00:25:47,251 --> 00:25:48,584
Can you check with Accounting for me?

389
00:25:48,751 --> 00:25:50,251
See about collecting last month's pay.

390
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:51,917
It's the accountant's day off.

391
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:53,667
You and Woody have the same habit.

392
00:25:54,001 --> 00:25:56,042
Forsaking your wages to go on a trip.

393
00:26:20,167 --> 00:26:21,167
What song is that?

394
00:26:22,042 --> 00:26:22,876
What?

395
00:26:23,334 --> 00:26:25,459
Just want to know which song.

396
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:27,417
It's really familiar.

397
00:26:28,584 --> 00:26:29,792
Forgot the name though.

398
00:26:30,542 --> 00:26:31,459
Do you know?

399
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:32,917
No.

400
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,084
What are you doing here so late?

401
00:26:36,584 --> 00:26:38,542
I'm waiting for my cheque.

402
00:26:39,209 --> 00:26:40,251
Why are you stuck here this hour?

403
00:26:40,459 --> 00:26:41,542
Overtime.

404
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:43,667
Take your time.

405
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:08,251
You're punctual with assignments...

406
00:27:08,459 --> 00:27:09,834
...but only collect paychecks every 6 months.

407
00:27:10,001 --> 00:27:11,459
You must have money to spare.

408
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:13,167
I can save it with you.

409
00:27:13,334 --> 00:27:15,792
Scared you'll abscond with it? Thanks.

410
00:27:17,709 --> 00:27:18,459
Weren't you searching for references?

411
00:27:18,626 --> 00:27:19,876
Why is it taking you a lifetime?

412
00:27:20,042 --> 00:27:21,042
Print them out.

413
00:27:21,209 --> 00:27:23,709
Make 6 copies of the agenda from my thumb drive.

414
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:25,251
Put it on my desk.

415
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:48,959
What?

416
00:27:49,792 --> 00:27:53,459
Thumb drive? Six copies?

417
00:27:59,834 --> 00:28:00,876
Want me to give you one?

418
00:28:02,209 --> 00:28:03,334
Fine.

419
00:28:19,001 --> 00:28:20,126
Press.

420
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:36,876
Gift from fiance?

421
00:28:37,501 --> 00:28:38,667
Yes.

422
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:40,709
We've split.

423
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:53,667
Next time...

424
00:28:53,834 --> 00:28:55,334
Hitch on to a bestseller.

425
00:29:05,084 --> 00:29:06,042
What's up?

426
00:29:06,209 --> 00:29:07,709
Just re-packing my stuff.

427
00:29:09,542 --> 00:29:11,209
I notified the airline of my whereabouts.

428
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:13,042
They got my luggage off the plane.

429
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,376
That's good.

430
00:29:15,417 --> 00:29:16,626
I'll wash first.

431
00:29:18,209 --> 00:29:19,417
What's your plan?

432
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:21,584
What?

433
00:29:22,751 --> 00:29:25,126
Have you've found a place to stay yet?

434
00:29:25,292 --> 00:29:26,751
Need to lend you some money?

435
00:29:27,667 --> 00:29:28,876
No need.

436
00:29:29,126 --> 00:29:31,167
Don't worry. I'll be gone soon.

437
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:32,251
I won't be a nuisance.

438
00:29:32,417 --> 00:29:33,792
I don't mean that.

439
00:29:36,751 --> 00:29:38,209
Gecko!

440
00:29:38,626 --> 00:29:39,751
Where?

441
00:29:40,084 --> 00:29:41,084
Here!

442
00:29:41,459 --> 00:29:44,251
They're beneficial. They feed on mosquitoes.

443
00:29:45,626 --> 00:29:46,751
Hey!

444
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:48,417
What?

445
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:50,334
A moth!

446
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:54,751
Living in the boondocks.

447
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:57,709
You have to learn to live with vermins.

448
00:29:59,042 --> 00:30:01,001
Get rid of it quick!

449
00:30:01,542 --> 00:30:03,334
It takes one kind to deal with another.

450
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:04,792
Find us a gecko.

451
00:30:05,042 --> 00:30:08,751
Gecko feeds on bugs and moths.

452
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:09,376
It's voracious.

453
00:30:09,542 --> 00:30:11,126
It's you who's scared of moths.

454
00:30:11,417 --> 00:30:13,001
How are we going to find a gecko?

455
00:30:13,167 --> 00:30:15,042
We've been raising one...

456
00:30:15,209 --> 00:30:16,292
behind the closet.

457
00:30:16,459 --> 00:30:18,376
It only comes out to feed at night.

458
00:30:18,834 --> 00:30:19,667
Don't you believe me?

459
00:30:20,667 --> 00:30:21,792
It makes noises.

460
00:30:22,126 --> 00:30:23,626
How can gecko make noise?

461
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,042
Come with me.

462
00:30:27,209 --> 00:30:28,001
What?

463
00:30:28,417 --> 00:30:30,501
It's really there. Go in!

464
00:30:32,751 --> 00:30:35,001
- You're mad! - Trust me. Hurry.

465
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:40,084
Do I look like a sucker?

466
00:30:40,459 --> 00:30:42,667
You think I'm so easily fooled?

467
00:30:42,834 --> 00:30:44,751
Nuts! Gecko are beneficial.

468
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:46,001
Can you hear them?

469
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:47,251
Is that rig ht?

470
00:30:47,501 --> 00:30:49,709
Quiet! Hear that?

471
00:30:51,251 --> 00:30:52,334
Didn't I tell you.

472
00:30:58,042 --> 00:30:59,584
It's true. I hear it.

473
00:31:01,501 --> 00:31:02,834
I hear it too.

474
00:31:04,001 --> 00:31:05,167
It's your slippers.

475
00:31:07,709 --> 00:31:10,459
Slipper! Slipper! Slipper!

476
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:17,709
Here! Kill it.

477
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:24,917
Didn't you tell me gecko's beneficial?

478
00:31:25,542 --> 00:31:27,042
There's no mosquitoes here.

479
00:31:45,042 --> 00:31:46,876
I thought you don't snack late.

480
00:31:56,042 --> 00:31:57,126
You're hungry?

481
00:31:58,251 --> 00:31:59,501
No.

482
00:32:09,834 --> 00:32:11,959
She's asleep. Lower the sound.

483
00:32:21,251 --> 00:32:22,459
Told you I'm not hungry.

484
00:32:31,792 --> 00:32:33,042
I'm watching.

485
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:37,126
This one?

486
00:32:39,084 --> 00:32:40,417
This?

487
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:42,084
This?

488
00:32:42,459 --> 00:32:43,792
News.

489
00:32:53,834 --> 00:32:54,709
What are you doing?

490
00:32:56,209 --> 00:32:58,501
Not so loud. People's asleep.

491
00:33:41,209 --> 00:33:44,501
Stop! I give up.

492
00:33:51,626 --> 00:33:52,626
What's this?

493
00:33:53,459 --> 00:33:54,584
Look and see.

494
00:33:57,417 --> 00:33:58,459
Why is there only one?

495
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:04,209
You're too much.

496
00:34:07,126 --> 00:34:08,292
Perfect.

497
00:34:25,542 --> 00:34:26,584
What?

498
00:34:28,042 --> 00:34:29,376
Make way.

499
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:31,084
Move. I'm in a hurry.

500
00:34:33,876 --> 00:34:34,917
What? Did you drop something?

501
00:34:36,626 --> 00:34:37,792
Look for it later.

502
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:41,167
How can you drop things down the drain?

503
00:34:41,959 --> 00:34:43,209
Barging in without knocking.

504
00:34:43,376 --> 00:34:44,917
I wouldn't have dropped it otherwise.

505
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:48,417
I live here. Why do I need to knock?

506
00:34:49,334 --> 00:34:50,376
Why didn't you look the door?

507
00:34:52,626 --> 00:34:54,459
You're ruining my flat.

508
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:56,084
You're not happy till you tear everything apart.

509
00:34:56,251 --> 00:34:58,042
None of your business.

510
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:01,459
It's my flat. What you destroy here is my concern.

511
00:35:01,626 --> 00:35:04,501
Why are you forcing the drain open?

512
00:35:04,751 --> 00:35:05,876
Did you drop something in? Let me help.

513
00:35:06,042 --> 00:35:07,001
Mind your own business.

514
00:35:07,167 --> 00:35:08,334
Why are you bossing me around?

515
00:35:10,751 --> 00:35:11,751
Can't I show a little concern for friends?

516
00:35:11,959 --> 00:35:13,709
Who said," can't be friends after breaking up"?

517
00:35:14,084 --> 00:35:16,334
Say you're forgetful yet
you remember things like that.

518
00:35:16,501 --> 00:35:18,001
How can you forget what you said before?

519
00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:19,251
Why should I remember?

520
00:35:24,251 --> 00:35:25,334
What do you want?

521
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,751
And you?

522
00:35:30,417 --> 00:35:31,751
Nothing.

523
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:38,126
You weren't like this before.

524
00:35:40,001 --> 00:35:44,084
Before? Why talk about before?

525
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,251
Before when we were together...

526
00:35:47,709 --> 00:35:49,126
your only concern was the past.

527
00:35:50,417 --> 00:35:51,584
You haven't improved one bit.

528
00:35:53,792 --> 00:35:55,376
- Come here! Look carefully. - What now?

529
00:35:56,001 --> 00:35:59,251
I'm leasing this spacious flat
with kitchen and study.

530
00:35:59,417 --> 00:36:00,001
Let go!

531
00:36:00,167 --> 00:36:01,334
Do you know what I'm doing at work?

532
00:36:01,501 --> 00:36:03,126
I'm a producer, not a designer.

533
00:36:03,459 --> 00:36:04,584
You wanted to be a designer.

534
00:36:04,751 --> 00:36:06,459
You switched jobs
because you weren't earning enough.

535
00:36:06,626 --> 00:36:07,459
And you?

536
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:10,042
You impulsively quit your job
to travel with a guy.

537
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,001
I haven't improve? And you?

538
00:36:12,209 --> 00:36:13,459
What are you? You're nothing!

539
00:36:13,626 --> 00:36:14,542
Let go!

540
00:36:16,042 --> 00:36:16,834
Bugger off!

541
00:36:25,501 --> 00:36:26,709
I don't appreciate your books.

542
00:36:26,959 --> 00:36:27,917
I don't know how to shop for you.

543
00:36:28,084 --> 00:36:29,042
Everything I buy is a mistake.

544
00:36:29,209 --> 00:36:30,209
It's all wrong.

545
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:34,667
Those colors don't really suit me.

546
00:36:36,959 --> 00:36:38,209
Just try it on for me.

547
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:39,417
Do you wear clothes for her sake?

548
00:36:39,584 --> 00:36:40,792
What are you saying?

549
00:36:41,209 --> 00:36:42,167
Talking about her.

550
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:44,042
You're crazy!

551
00:36:44,459 --> 00:36:45,584
If you don't miss her...

552
00:36:46,584 --> 00:36:47,584
why keep her things around?

553
00:36:47,751 --> 00:36:49,167
Throw it out. Throw everything out!

554
00:36:49,501 --> 00:36:50,834
Did I ask you to throw your things out?

555
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:52,417
So unreasonable.

556
00:36:52,626 --> 00:36:53,792
Do you still carry a torch for her?

557
00:36:54,251 --> 00:36:56,626
Think what you like.

558
00:37:09,417 --> 00:37:10,376
I'm exhausted.

559
00:37:10,542 --> 00:37:11,501
I'm tired too.

560
00:37:14,542 --> 00:37:15,584
Let's call it quits.

561
00:37:27,209 --> 00:37:28,542
No more games.

562
00:37:29,417 --> 00:37:30,084
What now?

563
00:37:30,209 --> 00:37:31,626
Just kidding. Don't leave.

564
00:37:37,334 --> 00:37:38,917
Can't you at least pick the right things to throw?

565
00:37:42,292 --> 00:37:43,376
- I'm sorry. - Always like this.

566
00:37:45,084 --> 00:37:46,334
Go...

567
00:37:47,792 --> 00:37:49,126
Go!

568
00:39:13,667 --> 00:39:14,792
Do you have an upset stomach?

569
00:39:16,209 --> 00:39:17,459
Any drugs you're averse to?

570
00:39:18,501 --> 00:39:19,751
You have asthma?

571
00:39:21,542 --> 00:39:22,751
Menstrual cramps?

572
00:39:24,917 --> 00:39:27,584
Why keep shaking your head?

573
00:39:29,584 --> 00:39:31,751
No or don't know?

574
00:39:34,126 --> 00:39:35,126
Don't know

575
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:39,959
If you have cramps it's probably menstrual.

576
00:39:40,209 --> 00:39:41,667
At menstruation,

577
00:39:41,834 --> 00:39:43,834
it's possible that blood clots...

578
00:39:44,001 --> 00:39:46,417
will cause cervical contractions.

579
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:49,042
When it constricts, it's agonizing.

580
00:39:49,292 --> 00:39:51,376
Juveniles often have to deal with this symptom.

581
00:39:51,542 --> 00:39:53,334
After puberty, experiencing sexual activities...

582
00:39:55,542 --> 00:39:58,667
it's not a serious problem as you mature.

583
00:39:58,834 --> 00:40:00,959
Some don't experience this in their youth.

584
00:40:01,251 --> 00:40:03,126
When they're adults, the pain starts. Strange!

585
00:40:03,292 --> 00:40:04,376
How old are you?

586
00:40:05,251 --> 00:40:06,084
Twenty-five.

587
00:40:06,376 --> 00:40:09,001
I'm Forty.

588
00:40:10,251 --> 00:40:13,251
If it continues after 25, it's unusual.

589
00:40:13,376 --> 00:40:15,459
Probably caused by emotional disorders, Stress...

590
00:40:15,626 --> 00:40:17,876
...inducing hormonal disorders.

591
00:40:18,084 --> 00:40:21,792
Chinese medical diagnosis:
liver & 'qi' asphyxiation.

592
00:40:21,959 --> 00:40:25,084
Maybe your emotional life is irregular.

593
00:40:25,959 --> 00:40:27,709
Lovesick?

594
00:40:28,876 --> 00:40:30,626
Doctor, what are trying to tell me?

595
00:40:30,792 --> 00:40:31,917
There's a cause...

596
00:40:32,084 --> 00:40:33,126
for everything in this world.

597
00:40:33,292 --> 00:40:35,876
Let's see if I can be of any assistance to you.

598
00:40:36,292 --> 00:40:37,042
Doctor...

599
00:40:37,209 --> 00:40:38,584
Can we discuss my insurance policy first?

600
00:40:39,417 --> 00:40:40,542
That...

601
00:40:40,751 --> 00:40:42,417
Actually I don't believe in insurance.

602
00:40:42,584 --> 00:40:44,917
That's why I need to learn more about it.

603
00:40:45,417 --> 00:40:46,376
What are you doing?

604
00:40:48,501 --> 00:40:51,542
The drugs you buy over the counter

605
00:40:51,709 --> 00:40:53,417
have a lot of impurities

606
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:56,917
that stays in your body for over 5 years.

607
00:40:57,084 --> 00:40:58,251
But they're effective pain-killers.

608
00:40:58,417 --> 00:41:01,917
As the saying goes: eat reservedly,
speak with caution.

609
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,917
Look at the carcass you're devouring.

610
00:41:04,084 --> 00:41:05,751
See how the blood gushes out.

611
00:41:05,917 --> 00:41:06,584
See it?

612
00:41:06,792 --> 00:41:10,126
It's full of bacteria like Salmonella.

613
00:41:15,292 --> 00:41:16,917
What's up, brother?

614
00:41:17,084 --> 00:41:18,251
How should I know?

615
00:41:18,459 --> 00:41:19,459
Your name's Du?

616
00:41:19,917 --> 00:41:20,792
That's me.

617
00:41:20,959 --> 00:41:21,917
No mistake then.

618
00:41:22,084 --> 00:41:23,792
There has to be a reason.

619
00:41:26,792 --> 00:41:29,209
Job's done, boss.

620
00:41:29,417 --> 00:41:32,459
But the target wants to know why he's hit.

621
00:41:36,417 --> 00:41:39,126
Boss says to keep your fucking mouth shut.

622
00:42:06,376 --> 00:42:07,626
Why are you so good to me?

623
00:42:11,709 --> 00:42:12,876
But you're with Cee already.

624
00:42:14,959 --> 00:42:16,167
Doesn't mean I can't be good to you too.

625
00:42:19,751 --> 00:42:21,042
It's not that you can't...

626
00:42:21,834 --> 00:42:23,376
...but WHY be good to me?

627
00:42:27,126 --> 00:42:29,001
Does everything need to be spelled out?

628
00:42:36,376 --> 00:42:40,084
Fine...

629
00:42:40,251 --> 00:42:44,001
I'll take care of it tomorrow.

630
00:43:00,542 --> 00:43:01,751
Don't worry.

631
00:43:04,084 --> 00:43:05,209
If you're disfigured...

632
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:07,084
I'll marry you.

633
00:43:28,792 --> 00:43:30,292
Water? Let me get you a glass.

634
00:43:36,751 --> 00:43:37,709
I get you a glass.

635
00:44:05,001 --> 00:44:06,834
After that, you became a couple?

636
00:44:10,001 --> 00:44:12,001
Some things are better left unsaid.

637
00:44:15,501 --> 00:44:16,917
Can I ask you now? Can I?

638
00:44:23,126 --> 00:44:24,376
Then why are you still asking?

639
00:44:54,167 --> 00:44:55,042
Where were you?

640
00:44:55,209 --> 00:44:56,376
Nowhere.

641
00:45:05,001 --> 00:45:06,417
I've changed jobs.

642
00:45:06,959 --> 00:45:08,876
Better quit if you're unhappy.

643
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:12,001
What will you be doing next month?

644
00:45:19,834 --> 00:45:21,501
I don't even know about tomorrow.

645
00:45:22,709 --> 00:45:24,042
Why?

646
00:45:26,959 --> 00:45:30,584
It's my Dad's birthday next month.

647
00:45:31,376 --> 00:45:32,709
We'll take him to dinner.

648
00:45:33,417 --> 00:45:34,917
He's not here.

649
00:45:35,542 --> 00:45:36,584
Where is he?

650
00:45:41,042 --> 00:45:42,334
In the cemetery.

651
00:45:44,667 --> 00:45:45,709
Let's visit.

652
00:45:47,417 --> 00:45:48,667
OK?

653
00:46:05,709 --> 00:46:07,251
Did he spoil you?

654
00:46:09,251 --> 00:46:10,876
He's a man of few words.

655
00:46:15,126 --> 00:46:17,626
Mom does all the talking.

656
00:46:20,001 --> 00:46:21,334
Mom use to say

657
00:46:22,626 --> 00:46:26,209
The one you like best
is never the one by your side.

658
00:46:29,917 --> 00:46:31,584
But I think...

659
00:46:34,042 --> 00:46:36,792
Great if someone's at my side listening.

660
00:46:36,959 --> 00:46:38,126
That's great!

661
00:46:42,959 --> 00:46:44,709
Aren't I listening to you now?

662
00:47:42,042 --> 00:47:44,334
Actually, when do you intend to go?

663
00:47:47,334 --> 00:47:49,126
What? Go?

664
00:47:49,917 --> 00:47:51,126
Go where?

665
00:47:51,292 --> 00:47:52,334
Thailand

666
00:47:53,876 --> 00:47:55,209
You were planning a trip anyway.

667
00:47:56,084 --> 00:47:57,501
Why are you always like this?

668
00:47:57,834 --> 00:47:59,917
Never explain where or what you're up to.

669
00:48:00,084 --> 00:48:01,417
Suddenly making me leave.

670
00:48:02,292 --> 00:48:04,959
Going for how long? Coming back when?

671
00:48:05,542 --> 00:48:06,417
Don't know yet.

672
00:48:08,584 --> 00:48:10,042
Don't know yet.

673
00:48:11,001 --> 00:48:13,167
Have to leave now.

674
00:48:14,042 --> 00:48:15,126
I'm not going!

675
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:16,792
Why's everyone like that?

676
00:48:17,042 --> 00:48:18,376
Never keep your word.

677
00:48:22,542 --> 00:48:23,751
I'm good for my word.

678
00:48:25,084 --> 00:48:26,417
Trust me?

679
00:49:05,584 --> 00:49:07,626
Why is our timing always off?

680
00:49:10,084 --> 00:49:11,417
Every time after breaking up...

681
00:49:11,751 --> 00:49:13,042
I try to look you up.

682
00:49:13,709 --> 00:49:14,959
It's you who never see me.

683
00:49:18,084 --> 00:49:20,376
We can still be friends after break up.

684
00:49:22,917 --> 00:49:24,001
Actually, I've tried calling you.

685
00:49:24,917 --> 00:49:26,376
I lost my mobile.

686
00:49:26,542 --> 00:49:28,459
Babe, tell Mommy

687
00:49:29,376 --> 00:49:32,626
Babe, I'm not getting any signal.

688
00:49:32,834 --> 00:49:35,001
Hello...Hello...

689
00:49:43,459 --> 00:49:44,292
Hello

690
00:49:44,709 --> 00:49:47,376
Ping's in the shower,
who's asking for him?

691
00:49:48,167 --> 00:49:50,917
Hello, hello

692
00:49:54,959 --> 00:49:56,126
I didn't know you called.

693
00:49:59,959 --> 00:50:01,709
My number's still the same.

694
00:50:02,876 --> 00:50:04,167
Just waiting for you to call.

695
00:50:06,459 --> 00:50:07,709
Do you remember...

696
00:50:07,917 --> 00:50:10,459
where I finally found you?

697
00:50:10,751 --> 00:50:12,042
At Franster's.

698
00:50:12,959 --> 00:50:14,084
I remember.

699
00:50:15,876 --> 00:50:17,334
The first thing you said:

700
00:50:17,667 --> 00:50:19,292
You can discuss this at my graveside.

701
00:50:26,042 --> 00:50:28,001
Mom use to visit every year.

702
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:30,501
But lately, she stopped coming.

703
00:50:32,667 --> 00:50:34,709
Though she didn't like him best...

704
00:50:35,542 --> 00:50:37,126
...there's still no reason to forget him.

705
00:50:39,001 --> 00:50:42,501
Don't worry. If you die...

706
00:50:42,959 --> 00:50:44,584
I'll visit every year.

707
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:47,251
I actually prefer being first to die.

708
00:50:48,334 --> 00:50:51,209
Better to be missed than to miss someone.

709
00:51:36,542 --> 00:51:38,626
Let's travel. Where do you want to go?

710
00:51:40,459 --> 00:51:41,917
England.

711
00:51:44,626 --> 00:51:47,001
I just started work. Can't take time off.

712
00:51:49,167 --> 00:51:52,542
How's Taiwan? Just for a few days.

713
00:51:55,209 --> 00:51:56,417
I'm broke.

714
00:51:58,167 --> 00:51:59,292
I'll pay first.

715
00:52:02,334 --> 00:52:04,667
It's just that I bought something.

716
00:52:05,251 --> 00:52:07,126
What a waste of money.

717
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:11,417
Hey! Stop it...it's ticklish!

718
00:52:21,251 --> 00:52:22,459
So puny.

719
00:52:28,959 --> 00:52:30,626
Never realize your fingers so big.

720
00:52:30,834 --> 00:52:31,376
"F"you

721
00:52:31,542 --> 00:52:32,667
Really?

722
00:52:34,459 --> 00:52:35,584
Do it now.

723
00:52:39,626 --> 00:52:41,792
Can't. Leg cramps!

724
00:52:43,084 --> 00:52:44,459
- Which one? - Both.

725
00:52:45,001 --> 00:52:45,917
Can't wait.

726
00:52:53,709 --> 00:52:55,126
You always play your own music.

727
00:52:55,292 --> 00:52:56,667
The customers never complain?

728
00:52:57,084 --> 00:52:58,626
The music's good.

729
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:01,042
But you got complains before?

730
00:53:01,626 --> 00:53:03,376
I'm not really a taxi driver.

731
00:53:03,542 --> 00:53:05,376
It's your boyfriend who treats me like one.

732
00:53:06,001 --> 00:53:07,334
What do you actually do?

733
00:53:08,501 --> 00:53:09,751
I'm a musician.

734
00:53:10,251 --> 00:53:12,334
Really? How impressive!

735
00:53:19,167 --> 00:53:20,126
What now?

736
00:53:20,917 --> 00:53:23,001
I forgot my passport.

737
00:53:25,292 --> 00:53:26,542
Can't leave now.

738
00:53:27,751 --> 00:53:30,667
Sol, can you take me home?

739
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:33,834
From here?

740
00:53:36,501 --> 00:53:38,709
Don't have time. It's 5 already.

741
00:53:39,417 --> 00:53:40,959
Sol!

742
00:53:41,876 --> 00:53:43,209
I'll try to rush.

743
00:53:44,126 --> 00:53:45,709
Why rush? If you forgot your passport...

744
00:53:45,876 --> 00:53:47,209
...how do you expect to travel?

745
00:53:48,001 --> 00:53:49,834
I really want to go.

746
00:53:50,709 --> 00:53:54,001
Sol, can you make a u-turn here?

747
00:54:00,251 --> 00:54:01,459
Stop teasing, you bastard.

748
00:54:01,626 --> 00:54:03,376
She's tearing up.

749
00:54:04,084 --> 00:54:05,084
What?

750
00:54:07,209 --> 00:54:08,959
I have your passport.

751
00:54:09,251 --> 00:54:11,251
You left it on the coffee table.

752
00:54:11,709 --> 00:54:12,876
I took it for you.

753
00:54:15,292 --> 00:54:16,376
Stop the car. I'm not going.

754
00:54:17,126 --> 00:54:18,751
We end up failing to go on a trip.

755
00:54:27,292 --> 00:54:28,751
Don't. Don't.

756
00:54:35,417 --> 00:54:37,417
It's just a prank.

757
00:54:37,917 --> 00:54:38,876
Don't get mad.

758
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:40,709
What prank? You don't intend to go to Taiwan.

759
00:54:40,876 --> 00:54:42,209
You like England, isn't it?

760
00:54:43,251 --> 00:54:44,959
I never said that. Come on!

761
00:54:45,751 --> 00:54:47,292
You want to go, go yourself.

762
00:54:52,167 --> 00:54:53,709
Take her there. I'll find my own way.

763
00:54:54,501 --> 00:54:56,251
I don't have my passport. I shouldn't go.

764
00:54:56,417 --> 00:54:57,417
Let me. Let me.

765
00:54:58,376 --> 00:55:00,251
Excuse me but this car isn't mine.

766
00:55:00,417 --> 00:55:01,417
It's my Dad's, OK?

767
00:55:01,834 --> 00:55:02,876
If you have any needs, call me.

768
00:55:03,042 --> 00:55:04,751
If you need to use the car, call me.

769
00:55:06,042 --> 00:55:07,209
You're not really leaving are you?

770
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:14,167
Don't be mad.

771
00:55:15,167 --> 00:55:16,459
Sorry.

772
00:55:25,417 --> 00:55:26,417
Hey.

773
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:32,126
Larry, I really admire you.

774
00:55:32,917 --> 00:55:34,667
But without compensation,
one can't survive on talent only.

775
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:38,876
Opportunity wasted. it's a shame!

776
00:55:39,501 --> 00:55:41,792
Without compensation,
one can't survive on talent only.

777
00:55:42,042 --> 00:55:45,334
Opportunity wasted. it's a shame!

778
00:55:45,501 --> 00:55:48,292
Yes. I'm sorry, Mr. Ho.

779
00:55:48,459 --> 00:55:51,417
Ping,you shouldn't be short-sighted.

780
00:55:51,584 --> 00:55:55,167
If your work's exceptional,
someone's bound to notice.

781
00:55:55,376 --> 00:55:57,126
Don't dwell on fame and fortune.

782
00:55:57,292 --> 00:56:00,334
If you're famous, you will be in demand.

783
00:56:00,501 --> 00:56:02,334
But Mr Ho, I can't accept it.

784
00:56:03,292 --> 00:56:04,626
It's my design.

785
00:56:05,751 --> 00:56:06,834
How can someone else claim credit?

786
00:56:07,001 --> 00:56:09,709
Ping, I really respect you.

787
00:56:10,792 --> 00:56:11,834
Hello...Ping

788
00:56:12,376 --> 00:56:13,667
Yes...

789
00:56:15,542 --> 00:56:17,209
I honestly can't accept it.

790
00:56:18,001 --> 00:56:20,959
You motherfucker. Why are you so stubborn?

791
00:56:21,126 --> 00:56:22,959
You think you're really an artist?

792
00:56:23,126 --> 00:56:25,251
You're a disgrace to your profession.

793
00:56:25,417 --> 00:56:26,667
Motherfucker!

794
00:56:26,834 --> 00:56:29,167
You make his family frantic,
mentioning them so much.

795
00:56:29,501 --> 00:56:31,167
He's quitting. Save your breathe.

796
00:56:31,334 --> 00:56:32,042
Who's that?

797
00:56:32,209 --> 00:56:32,542
Sorry, Mr. Ho.

798
00:56:32,709 --> 00:56:33,501
Chen Jun Ping

799
00:56:33,667 --> 00:56:38,042
The girls you pick are either crazy or stupid.

800
00:56:38,251 --> 00:56:40,501
It'll be disastrous
if I hand you bastards the job.

801
00:56:40,667 --> 00:56:42,876
Mr. Ho, why don't you...

802
00:56:43,834 --> 00:56:44,917
...go stuff yourself.

803
00:56:55,292 --> 00:56:56,376
So what now?

804
00:56:57,251 --> 00:56:59,459
Unemployed. No big deal.

805
00:57:11,584 --> 00:57:15,042
I want to move to Kowloon.
Don't want to live here.

806
00:57:16,584 --> 00:57:20,584
Mr. Chen, I understand you just lost your job.

807
00:57:22,876 --> 00:57:25,917
I have some savings. Will last me a few months.

808
00:57:27,292 --> 00:57:30,542
You can move in with me first.

809
00:57:31,876 --> 00:57:33,417
You have a point.

810
00:57:36,292 --> 00:57:37,376
How are we going to leave?

811
00:57:42,209 --> 00:57:43,917
Are you nuts, Chen Jun Ping?

812
00:57:44,084 --> 00:57:45,834
$8000 for a sofa. Are you loaded?

813
00:58:01,042 --> 00:58:02,334
What?

814
00:58:08,167 --> 00:58:09,501
It's OK. Don't worry.

815
00:58:10,459 --> 00:58:12,959
It'll be done soon.

816
00:58:13,126 --> 00:58:15,084
Careful. Hands off first.

817
00:58:15,251 --> 00:58:15,876
Look up.

818
00:58:17,626 --> 00:58:18,876
How's that?

819
00:58:21,334 --> 00:58:22,292
It's CK.

820
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:24,209
You're terrific!

821
00:58:25,959 --> 00:58:27,917
Next time don't buy if there's no delivery.

822
00:58:28,084 --> 00:58:29,251
It's nine flights!

823
00:58:29,459 --> 00:58:30,876
Mind your hands!

824
00:58:31,042 --> 00:58:32,667
This has been on my wish list.

825
00:58:32,834 --> 00:58:34,626
But my former flat was too cramp.

826
00:58:34,876 --> 00:58:36,917
Now it's discounted.

827
00:58:39,792 --> 00:58:42,334
Yeah, it's cheap but have you considered...

828
00:58:42,501 --> 00:58:43,709
...in my 300 square feet apartment...

829
00:58:44,334 --> 00:58:46,667
...how congested with this in it.

830
00:58:47,834 --> 00:58:50,501
When we move to a bigger place, it will fit.

831
00:58:50,917 --> 00:58:52,084
- Let's go! - OK...

832
00:58:52,251 --> 00:58:54,584
I'm really pooped out.

833
00:58:55,542 --> 00:58:56,917
Just a short haul. It won't kill you.

834
00:58:58,334 --> 00:58:59,917
You die now and I'll burn it as offering to you.

835
00:59:00,084 --> 00:59:01,209
Then no need to haul it.

836
00:59:04,501 --> 00:59:05,501
"F"you

837
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:06,959
Forget it.

838
00:59:08,334 --> 00:59:09,376
I can't. It hurts.

839
00:59:09,751 --> 00:59:11,417
My jaw was dislocated today.

840
00:59:12,126 --> 00:59:14,542
How was it dislocated?

841
00:59:14,876 --> 00:59:16,209
At my interview.

842
00:59:16,376 --> 00:59:20,709
The guy was really hilarious.

843
00:59:20,876 --> 00:59:23,292
Nuts! Who ever dislocate their jaws laughing?

844
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:24,042
You think I'm a fool?

845
00:59:24,209 --> 00:59:26,876
- No. - Let's go.

846
00:59:27,542 --> 00:59:29,459
It was hysterical. He ran into a glass panel.

847
00:59:29,626 --> 00:59:30,876
What was the interview for?

848
00:59:31,042 --> 00:59:31,917
Publishing house.

849
00:59:32,251 --> 00:59:33,417
Publishing?

850
00:59:33,542 --> 00:59:34,542
Right.

851
00:59:34,709 --> 00:59:36,417
- How capable! - Right.

852
00:59:36,542 --> 00:59:38,334
- Talented girl. - Right.

853
00:59:38,667 --> 00:59:39,542
Can you read?

854
00:59:41,542 --> 00:59:42,876
"F"you

855
00:59:43,667 --> 00:59:45,542
Now? Make it quick!

856
00:59:45,751 --> 00:59:46,209
While no one's around.

857
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:49,709
I'll ignore that.

858
00:59:50,167 --> 00:59:50,959
Where you going?

859
00:59:51,126 --> 00:59:52,792
Toilet. Wait.

860
00:59:53,001 --> 00:59:54,751
I'll wait. I'll be here.

861
01:00:23,001 --> 01:00:24,126
There's people.

862
01:00:40,501 --> 01:00:42,584
Actually after splitting with you...

863
01:00:43,626 --> 01:00:45,001
...I only went with Cee.

864
01:00:46,626 --> 01:00:50,626
Same here. For me it was just Woody.

865
01:00:53,959 --> 01:00:55,501
Why did you lie?

866
01:00:57,626 --> 01:00:59,292
Heard of the statistics?

867
01:00:59,501 --> 01:01:01,876
Every person averages 6 lies per day.

868
01:01:03,751 --> 01:01:09,751
So few? Like..."I don't want to see you again!"

869
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,501
"You better leave soon."

870
01:01:13,501 --> 01:01:14,959
"I've forgotten you."

871
01:01:16,667 --> 01:01:18,209
Seems too conservative an estimate.

872
01:01:20,292 --> 01:01:22,042
Yeah, so idiotic.

873
01:01:26,834 --> 01:01:27,917
Also...

874
01:01:31,667 --> 01:01:32,959
"I don't fancy you."

875
01:02:06,959 --> 01:02:07,792
What?

876
01:02:08,709 --> 01:02:09,959
Menstruation.

877
01:02:40,417 --> 01:02:41,376
Hi.

878
01:02:47,917 --> 01:02:50,292
I'm...on my way to office.

879
01:02:50,667 --> 01:02:51,792
Traffic jam.

880
01:02:54,209 --> 01:02:55,501
You forgot something?

881
01:02:56,459 --> 01:02:58,084
I can't return in time to give you the key.

882
01:02:59,834 --> 01:03:01,126
Where are you?

883
01:03:07,542 --> 01:03:08,751
Is she on her way?

884
01:03:18,792 --> 01:03:20,626
So early? No work today?

885
01:03:21,042 --> 01:03:22,667
I forgot something.

886
01:03:27,792 --> 01:03:29,001
Zhou Yi.

887
01:03:36,126 --> 01:03:37,417
It's best you leave.

888
01:03:44,251 --> 01:03:45,959
Let me return your clothes.

889
01:04:57,042 --> 01:04:57,917
Can we start speaking?

890
01:04:58,084 --> 01:04:59,292
Yeah.

891
01:04:59,459 --> 01:05:00,834
Is it recording?

892
01:05:01,001 --> 01:05:02,417
Yes, is still recording

893
01:05:02,584 --> 01:05:05,584
Say you're not in Hong Kong. Leave a message.

894
01:05:05,792 --> 01:05:09,376
You're not in Hong Kong. Leave a message.

895
01:05:10,126 --> 01:05:13,376
Hi, where are you?

896
01:05:15,376 --> 01:05:16,876
When can you get back?

897
01:05:23,209 --> 01:05:23,917
Hi.

898
01:05:37,542 --> 01:05:38,876
- Hi. - Why did you come?

899
01:05:39,084 --> 01:05:40,709
I called and you said you're here.

900
01:05:41,209 --> 01:05:42,501
I'll put this in the car first.

901
01:05:45,959 --> 01:05:49,376
No, I mean why are you here?

902
01:05:53,251 --> 01:05:56,667
Ping text me. Asked me to call you.

903
01:05:57,292 --> 01:05:58,459
Watch out.

904
01:05:58,792 --> 01:06:00,459
Actually, Ping asked me to watch out for you.

905
01:06:00,626 --> 01:06:02,167
What's there to watch?

906
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:03,667
You do everything he tells you to?

907
01:06:03,834 --> 01:06:04,834
What a chump!

908
01:06:06,251 --> 01:06:07,417
Sorry!

909
01:06:08,001 --> 01:06:10,376
Why apologize?
He who should be apologizing doesn't bother.

910
01:06:10,542 --> 01:06:11,667
What are you sorry about?

911
01:06:12,626 --> 01:06:14,876
It's just that I kicked your bag.

912
01:06:50,251 --> 01:06:53,709
I'm sorry. Every time we meet I lose my temper.

913
01:06:57,917 --> 01:07:00,084
You weren't angry...

914
01:07:00,251 --> 01:07:01,501
the first time we met.

915
01:07:02,876 --> 01:07:03,876
When was that?

916
01:07:12,876 --> 01:07:15,626
Careful. Watch it.

917
01:08:11,542 --> 01:08:12,876
Hey, watch out.

918
01:08:25,792 --> 01:08:26,834
What song is this?

919
01:08:27,084 --> 01:08:28,334
Don't know. What is it?

920
01:08:28,959 --> 01:08:30,084
Don't know either.

921
01:08:30,417 --> 01:08:32,501
I thought as a musician you'd know everything.

922
01:08:32,876 --> 01:08:36,084
What musician? I'm just a hack.

923
01:08:36,959 --> 01:08:39,792
I like your music.

924
01:08:40,167 --> 01:08:41,584
It's passable.

925
01:08:42,334 --> 01:08:46,084
Of course not. If I sing as well as you...

926
01:08:46,459 --> 01:08:47,834
I'll sing without stop.

927
01:08:48,209 --> 01:08:51,584
Normally those who can't sing...

928
01:08:51,751 --> 01:08:53,459
...loves to sing to others.

929
01:08:56,751 --> 01:08:59,584
Don't misunderstand me. I'm talking about Ping.

930
01:12:09,667 --> 01:12:12,959
Are you pretending? No fooling.

931
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:01,834
Why did you come back?

932
01:13:03,084 --> 01:13:06,292
Didn't realize I have your passport
till I was on the plane.

933
01:13:07,042 --> 01:13:09,334
The minute I landed I changed my flight home.

934
01:13:10,042 --> 01:13:11,251
I called you.

935
01:13:12,042 --> 01:13:12,876
Called me?

936
01:13:13,042 --> 01:13:15,042
Right. I answered.

937
01:13:16,542 --> 01:13:18,209
Hey, eat.

938
01:13:18,376 --> 01:13:21,751
By your looks, you must have skipped breakfast.

939
01:13:21,917 --> 01:13:23,084
My hands are clean.

940
01:13:23,792 --> 01:13:29,126
I tell you, breakfast is the most important meal.

941
01:13:29,917 --> 01:13:31,792
Can you not talk with your mouth full?

942
01:13:31,959 --> 01:13:33,376
You're talking as you're eating.

943
01:13:33,542 --> 01:13:35,376
Why are you eating with your swim cap on?

944
01:13:35,626 --> 01:13:36,542
Don't you wear it only when swimming?

945
01:13:36,709 --> 01:13:39,376
Eating, you only use mouth.

946
01:13:39,542 --> 01:13:41,584
The head is idle, isn't it?

947
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:45,334
Life's short. Use your time wisely.

948
01:13:45,501 --> 01:13:47,917
My Cantonese has deteriorated but you understand.

949
01:13:50,584 --> 01:13:52,167
You're just like your mother.

950
01:13:53,542 --> 01:13:55,709
I'm prettier.

951
01:13:55,876 --> 01:13:56,959
That's for sure.

952
01:13:57,751 --> 01:13:59,709
You have taste.

953
01:14:01,792 --> 01:14:03,126
Auntie, I'm Woody.

954
01:14:04,459 --> 01:14:08,917
Yes, Uncle. It's Woody, isn't it?

955
01:14:09,126 --> 01:14:10,126
'Woody' as in 'Wood'. Right?

956
01:14:10,292 --> 01:14:10,876
Yes.

957
01:14:11,042 --> 01:14:12,042
So did you pass your driver's test?

958
01:14:12,209 --> 01:14:13,292
How many times did you have to repeat?

959
01:14:13,751 --> 01:14:15,542
I passed on the first try.

960
01:14:16,709 --> 01:14:19,959
Not him.

961
01:14:21,209 --> 01:14:22,751
How many are there?

962
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:24,751
So, who's the one who kept failing?

963
01:14:25,751 --> 01:14:26,376
Can you not ask?

964
01:14:26,542 --> 01:14:28,501
You question me and I can't question you?

965
01:14:29,876 --> 01:14:32,501
Babe, you're wrong.

966
01:14:33,667 --> 01:14:35,459
If two people are together...

967
01:14:35,667 --> 01:14:39,042
...there's nothing
that can't be asked and answered.

968
01:14:39,792 --> 01:14:41,001
We've broken up.

969
01:14:42,334 --> 01:14:44,126
Then you're improper.

970
01:14:44,626 --> 01:14:45,876
Didn't you tell me over the phone...

971
01:14:46,042 --> 01:14:49,917
...that you're going with my daughter.

972
01:14:50,084 --> 01:14:52,126
Well, we ARE together now.

973
01:14:55,792 --> 01:14:56,959
Don't know what the devil you're up to.

974
01:14:58,834 --> 01:15:00,626
Don't waste it. I'm going.

975
01:15:01,126 --> 01:15:01,917
Where are you going?

976
01:15:02,167 --> 01:15:03,459
You'll get cramps if you swim after eating.

977
01:15:03,626 --> 01:15:06,542
Not swim. Rinsing.

978
01:15:06,709 --> 01:15:07,917
Time's up.

979
01:15:12,501 --> 01:15:14,001
Your Mom's marvellous.

980
01:15:15,126 --> 01:15:18,167
Court her. She likes travelling too.

981
01:15:19,084 --> 01:15:20,501
You'll make a fine couple.

982
01:15:21,042 --> 01:15:22,626
What are you saying?

983
01:15:24,167 --> 01:15:26,626
You're enough for me. You have her genes.

984
01:15:34,084 --> 01:15:35,334
Passport. Purse.

985
01:15:37,876 --> 01:15:40,376
Could have mailed them. Why come back on purpose?

986
01:15:40,751 --> 01:15:42,334
Postage is expensive.

987
01:15:42,626 --> 01:15:44,084
Plane ticket isn't'?

988
01:15:44,876 --> 01:15:46,667
Well, isn't it better to send me back also?

989
01:15:50,042 --> 01:15:51,334
Sorry.

990
01:15:54,042 --> 01:15:57,542
Come back. Sit.

991
01:15:59,251 --> 01:16:00,626
I'm sorry.

992
01:16:01,584 --> 01:16:02,542
What?

993
01:16:03,501 --> 01:16:04,542
I'm sorry.

994
01:16:05,417 --> 01:16:06,376
Can't hear.

995
01:16:09,626 --> 01:16:12,542
I said I'm sorry. OK?

996
01:16:31,501 --> 01:16:33,334
A lot happened the last few days.

997
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:46,626
Were you listening?

998
01:16:49,834 --> 01:16:51,167
Here's the ferris wheel.

999
01:16:51,917 --> 01:16:54,667
This is IFC Building. With the lightning rod.

1000
01:17:13,917 --> 01:17:14,876
What?

1001
01:17:15,042 --> 01:17:17,626
I thought you'd check in another room next door.

1002
01:17:20,292 --> 01:17:22,084
What are you saying?

1003
01:17:30,709 --> 01:17:32,459
Move over.

1004
01:17:32,626 --> 01:17:36,209
Such a big bed. You're hogging it.

1005
01:17:36,667 --> 01:17:38,501
Don't step on me.

1006
01:17:38,626 --> 01:17:41,501
When I was small you'd forbid me
jumping on beds and sofas.

1007
01:17:41,667 --> 01:17:43,376
Now you're stomping away.

1008
01:17:43,542 --> 01:17:44,876
That's right.

1009
01:17:48,667 --> 01:17:51,459
Remember?

1010
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:56,501
You were always bouncing up and down on my bed.

1011
01:17:56,834 --> 01:17:58,917
Ruined all the springs.

1012
01:17:59,292 --> 01:18:00,834
Your Dad complained bitterly...

1013
01:18:01,001 --> 01:18:03,751
when he went to bed.

1014
01:18:04,792 --> 01:18:07,001
Stomp then, but watch my body.

1015
01:18:07,876 --> 01:18:09,167
Here I go.

1016
01:18:12,167 --> 01:18:14,501
I'll not stomp, I'll jump.

1017
01:18:14,667 --> 01:18:16,209
Come on, move!

1018
01:18:16,376 --> 01:18:18,334
I have menstrual pains.

1019
01:18:18,542 --> 01:18:21,001
Better menstrual pains than no menstrual.

1020
01:18:21,626 --> 01:18:22,709
Come on. Get up.

1021
01:18:22,876 --> 01:18:24,084
Move a little.

1022
01:18:24,792 --> 01:18:27,126
Move and no fear of menstrual pains.

1023
01:18:27,376 --> 01:18:29,376
Jump.

1024
01:18:44,167 --> 01:18:45,126
What now?

1025
01:18:45,334 --> 01:18:46,459
What?

1026
01:18:47,542 --> 01:18:48,626
What are you thinking?

1027
01:18:48,792 --> 01:18:51,042
He wants to be with me.

1028
01:18:51,209 --> 01:18:55,001
Which one? Taxi driver or Uncle?

1029
01:18:55,167 --> 01:18:57,334
He has a name.

1030
01:18:57,834 --> 01:19:01,209
Babe, how many boyfriends do you have?

1031
01:19:01,459 --> 01:19:04,959
Who's the one who failed
his driver's test 5 times?

1032
01:19:05,542 --> 01:19:08,709
Even if I tell you,
you'd still don't know who he is.

1033
01:19:09,459 --> 01:19:12,167
Then thanks but I don't really want to know.

1034
01:19:13,209 --> 01:19:17,126
More important is that you're clear about it.

1035
01:19:18,376 --> 01:19:21,084
I don't want to be like you.

1036
01:19:21,709 --> 01:19:22,667
Discover too late...

1037
01:19:22,834 --> 01:19:25,542
the one beside you isn't one you like best.

1038
01:19:29,834 --> 01:19:30,792
Wrong!

1039
01:19:35,417 --> 01:19:40,167
I never said the one beside me
isn't one I like best.

1040
01:19:40,834 --> 01:19:44,501
I said the one I like most...

1041
01:19:44,667 --> 01:19:46,584
...is no longer beside me.

1042
01:19:51,584 --> 01:19:55,084
Mom, can you take me travelling?

1043
01:20:00,334 --> 01:20:05,376
You can go on your own.

1044
01:20:07,459 --> 01:20:08,459
You're mature enough.

1045
01:22:03,876 --> 01:22:05,876
How did you get water all over?

1046
01:22:11,501 --> 01:22:12,501
Don't wipe it.

1047
01:22:14,251 --> 01:22:15,417
Give me that.

1048
01:22:19,084 --> 01:22:19,917
Get up. I'll do it.

1049
01:22:20,084 --> 01:22:20,876
Let go.

1050
01:22:21,042 --> 01:22:22,792
Let go!

1051
01:25:16,084 --> 01:25:17,542
- Morning. - Morning.

1052
01:25:19,334 --> 01:25:20,667
Why don't I take another test?

1053
01:25:21,251 --> 01:25:22,167
Again?

1054
01:25:22,667 --> 01:25:23,959
You've taken it 5 times.

1055
01:25:24,126 --> 01:25:26,792
You have to chauffeur me all the time.
it's not very well.

1056
01:25:26,959 --> 01:25:29,751
Doesn't matter. I'll take you wherever.

1057
01:25:30,751 --> 01:25:31,959
It's not convenient.

1058
01:25:35,417 --> 01:25:37,751
You had a late snack?

1059
01:25:41,667 --> 01:25:42,792
Yes.

1060
01:25:44,376 --> 01:25:45,917
Why didn't you clean up?

1061
01:25:50,001 --> 01:25:50,792
You're seeing someone else?

1062
01:25:51,001 --> 01:25:51,876
What?

1063
01:25:52,959 --> 01:25:54,501
Are you're going with someone else?

1064
01:25:55,417 --> 01:25:56,834
We talked about this. Why are you throwing things?

1065
01:26:00,667 --> 01:26:01,792
Are you or aren't you?

1066
01:26:03,376 --> 01:26:04,834
Stuff are meant for you to throw?

1067
01:26:05,001 --> 01:26:06,126
At least pick something expensive.

1068
01:26:07,126 --> 01:26:08,001
Yes or no?

1069
01:26:08,501 --> 01:26:10,501
No. What do you want?

1070
01:26:11,834 --> 01:26:13,792
No or not yet?

1071
01:26:16,292 --> 01:26:17,251
What are you saying?

1072
01:26:18,334 --> 01:26:20,001
I'm asking you, yes or no?

1073
01:26:22,251 --> 01:26:23,584
No.

1074
01:26:27,751 --> 01:26:28,834
Toss.

1075
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:30,876
Toss them! Keep it up!

1076
01:26:31,042 --> 01:26:32,292
Throw it!

1077
01:26:34,959 --> 01:26:36,792
You like throwing things, chuck it all!

1078
01:26:40,834 --> 01:26:42,334
What do you want?

1079
01:26:44,626 --> 01:26:45,834
Let's split.

1080
01:27:45,417 --> 01:27:49,376
We'll get plastic ones tomorrow, OK?

1081
01:27:58,459 --> 01:27:59,459
Sorry.

1082
01:28:01,501 --> 01:28:04,334
No need to apologize. Just wipe it up.

1083
01:28:08,584 --> 01:28:10,001
I'm not talking about that.

1084
01:28:19,251 --> 01:28:20,542
It doesn't matter.

1085
01:28:22,584 --> 01:28:23,792
Forget it.

1086
01:28:27,542 --> 01:28:29,042
Is there something not good about me?

1087
01:28:35,126 --> 01:28:36,251
I can change.

1088
01:28:40,584 --> 01:28:41,876
Drop it, OK?

1089
01:28:45,001 --> 01:28:46,542
I don't want to drop it.

1090
01:28:51,542 --> 01:28:53,209
I can't do without you.

1091
01:29:00,626 --> 01:29:02,792
There's no one on Earth
who can't do without another.

1092
01:31:50,667 --> 01:31:52,042
Where do you plan to go?

1093
01:31:52,834 --> 01:31:54,001
No plans.

1094
01:32:13,501 --> 01:32:14,542
So?

1095
01:32:15,001 --> 01:32:16,501
So what? I'm getting out.

1096
01:32:18,834 --> 01:32:20,001
Bye.

1097
01:32:20,917 --> 01:32:23,126
Thanks.Bye.

1098
01:32:24,001 --> 01:32:25,376
When are you returning?

1099
01:32:27,251 --> 01:32:29,167
I'm going on a trip, not emigrating.

1100
01:32:30,709 --> 01:32:32,501
Look me up.

1101
01:32:33,459 --> 01:32:34,626
Can't you look me up?

1102
01:32:34,959 --> 01:32:36,376
I don't know when you're coming back.

1103
01:32:37,292 --> 01:32:40,417
I mean... fly over and look me up.

1104
01:32:42,501 --> 01:32:43,626
OK.

1105
01:32:44,126 --> 01:32:45,042
Good. Let's go.

1106
01:32:45,209 --> 01:32:46,626
- Now? - Yeah.

1107
01:32:47,042 --> 01:32:48,209
I don't have anything on me.

1108
01:32:48,876 --> 01:32:50,542
Buy what you need.

1109
01:32:50,709 --> 01:32:52,209
Don't even have my passport.

1110
01:32:56,376 --> 01:32:57,584
Later then.

1111
01:32:59,251 --> 01:33:00,501
Think about it later.

1112
01:33:03,042 --> 01:33:04,792
Be careful.

1113
01:33:05,501 --> 01:33:06,626
You too.

1114
01:33:07,042 --> 01:33:08,417
- Bye. - Bye.

1115
01:33:12,542 --> 01:33:13,584
Take care

1116
01:33:14,084 --> 01:33:15,167
OK.
