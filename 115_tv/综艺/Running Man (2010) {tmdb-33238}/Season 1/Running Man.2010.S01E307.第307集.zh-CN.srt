00:00:02,332 --> 00:00:04,323
天!
Whoa!

3
00:00:04,367 --> 00:00:06,028
嗨, 嗨, 嗨!
Hey, hi, hi.

4
00:00:06,069 --> 00:00:08,469
怎么样啊?
How's it hanging?

5
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:13,775
－ 你们提前回来了.
－ 啊－哈.
￡- You guys are home early.
￡- Uh￡-huh.

6
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,438
发现你们俩在沙发上－－
你们可以想象一下我们有多吃惊
lmagine our surprise
to find you two on the couch￡-￡-

7
00:00:19,015 --> 00:00:22,576
对不起. 我觉得自己好像又回到了高中时代.
Sorry. l feel like
l'm back in high school.

8
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:24,849
Amy, 好啦.
那是唇印吗, 小姐?
Amy, come on.
ls that a hickey, young lady?

9
00:00:24,888 --> 00:00:27,015
－ 不是, 不是.
－ 耶, 我看到拉.
￡- No, no.
￡- Yeah, l see it.

10
00:00:27,057 --> 00:00:30,083
你妈妈知道你出来和这个--这个无赖约会吗?
Does your mom know you're going
out with this￡-￡- this hoodlum?

11
00:00:30,126 --> 00:00:33,994
求你了, Barone先生,
别告诉我妈妈.
Please, Mr. Barone,
don't tell my mother.

12
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,726
行行行,
我明白了.
All right, okay,
l get it.

13
00:00:36,766 --> 00:00:38,734
我好可怜.
l'm pathetic.

14
00:00:38,768 --> 00:00:40,565
你们在说什么啊?
What are you
talking about?

15
00:00:40,603 --> 00:00:42,503
我是一个和父母生活在一起的成年人
l'm a grown man
who lives with his parents

16
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:45,940
并且还要接受帮别人照看小孩的工作
这样他才能和他女朋友亲热.
and has to take babysitting jobs
so he can make out with his girlfriend.

17
00:00:48,311 --> 00:00:50,643
－ 不是这样的, Robert.
－ 不.
￡- That's not true, Robert.
￡- No.

18
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,114
－ 还是有点正确的.
－ 噢, 晕.
￡- lt's a little true.
￡- Oh, shh.

19
00:00:56,519 --> 00:00:58,714
Robert.
Robert.

20
00:01:03,326 --> 00:01:05,294
也许会变得更糟糕.
Could have been worse.

21
00:01:05,328 --> 00:01:07,956
如果让我父母帮忙照看孩子，
而我们这样走进来.
We could have walked in
on Mom and Dad babysitting.

22
00:01:09,788 --> 00:01:11,756
－ 你饿了吗, 亲爱的?
－ 不饿.
￡- You hungry, dear?
￡- No.

23
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,418
－ 我做了薄烤饼.
－ 不吃了, 我上班要迟到了.
￡- l got pancakes.
￡- No, l'm late for work.

24
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:17,155
－ 我可以带些薄烤饼走吗?
－ 可以, 等一下.
￡- Can l get them to go?
￡- Yeah, give me a second.

25
00:01:17,195 --> 00:01:20,028
嗯, 开饭了! Frank
OKay, let's go, Frank!

26
00:01:21,466 --> 00:01:25,129
－ 厨房并不是整天都开放的.
－ 不象你的嘴巴.
￡- Kitchen isn't open all day.
￡- Unlike your mouth.

27
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:30,599
嗨, 昨天晚上整晚的喧哗是怎么回事啊?
Hey, what was with all
that racket last night?

28
00:01:30,642 --> 00:01:31,904
什么喧哗?
What racket?

29
00:01:31,943 --> 00:01:34,878
大概在9点的样子,
我听到你的女朋友在说话.
Like around 9:00,
l heard your girlfriend talking.

30
00:01:34,913 --> 00:01:37,507
Amy说话就是喧哗?
Amy talking is racket?

31
00:01:38,616 --> 00:01:41,050
她又不是和我说话,
那好, 就算喧哗吧.
She's not talking to me,
so, yeah, racket.

32
00:01:42,921 --> 00:01:45,219
那么就是说我不能再和别人说话了?
So l'm not allowed
to talk to people any more?

33
00:01:45,256 --> 00:01:47,224
你当然能说话啦,
亲爱的.
Of course you are,
dear.

34
00:01:47,258 --> 00:01:50,955
顺便说一句,我同意Amy说的那句话.
By the way, l agree with
what Amy was saying.

35
00:01:50,996 --> 00:01:53,294
你并不可怜.
You are not
pathetic.

36
00:01:53,331 --> 00:01:56,232
你是在监视我?
You were spying on us?

37
00:01:56,267 --> 00:01:57,996
我只是刚好听到.
l was passing
an air vent.

38
00:02:00,705 --> 00:02:02,832
你真聪明, 大仙.
You're so cute, Yogi.

39
00:02:04,442 --> 00:02:06,433
她叫你大仙.
She calls you Yogi.

40
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:08,878
你下巴上有果汁.
You got some syrup
on your chin.

41
00:02:08,913 --> 00:02:10,904
你有没有叫她波波?
Do you call her Boo Boo?

42
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,018
－ 我来帮你弄掉.
－ 别, 别这样, 妈妈.
￡- Let me get it.
￡- No, stop it, Mom.

43
00:02:14,052 --> 00:02:16,020
－ 别瞎搞了.
－ 别，你别擦了.
￡- Stop fiddling.
￡- No, you stop it.

44
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:18,386
－ 好了, 别闹了!
－ 行, 就这样吧. 我要搬出去住了.
￡- No, you stop!
￡- Okay, that's it. l'm moving out.

45
00:02:19,824 --> 00:02:22,918
搬出去住?
真荒唐.
Moving out?
That's ridiculous.

46
00:02:24,362 --> 00:02:25,829
你打算怎么走?
What are you
gonna do?

47
00:02:25,864 --> 00:02:27,889
在棍子上系上波尔卡小点的手帕
Tie a little polka dot hanky
around a stick

48
00:02:27,932 --> 00:02:29,422
然后跳上货运列车?
and hop
a freight train?

49
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:35,596
我有车.
l have a car.

50
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,165
妈，你别笑了.
You can stop
laughing now, Ma.

51
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:40,040
行动吧.
行动吧, 伙计.
Do it.
Do it, man. Go.

52
00:02:40,078 --> 00:02:44,037
你别吵吵了.
Robby在这里过的幸福着呢.
You be quiet.
Robby's very happy here.

53
00:02:44,082 --> 00:02:47,017
你和你妈妈住在一起,
亲爱的, 你会过得很好.
You stay with your mother,
honey, you'll be fine.

54
00:02:48,486 --> 00:02:51,353
－ 他哪也不会去.
－ 哦，我会的.
￡- He's not going anywhere.
￡- Oh yes l am.

55
00:02:54,726 --> 00:02:56,694
别犯傻了.
Don't be silly.

56
00:02:56,728 --> 00:02:58,719
我们来想想上次的事情
Let's remember
what happened the last time

57
00:02:58,763 --> 00:03:00,663
上次你也象这样耍花样.
you pulled a stunt like this.

58
00:03:00,698 --> 00:03:02,996
妈，我要结婚了.
行了吧?
l got married, Ma.
Okay?

59
00:03:03,034 --> 00:03:05,400
我要帮出去
是因为我要结婚了.
l moved out
'cause l got married.

60
00:03:05,437 --> 00:03:07,564
对啊,
你要结婚了.
That's right,
you got married.

61
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:10,733
然后?
那有怎么样?
And?
What happened with that?

62
00:03:13,011 --> 00:03:15,070
你会在那糟糕的女人身上花掉所有的钱
You lost all your money
to that awful woman

63
00:03:15,113 --> 00:03:17,104
那女人会抹上三种不同眼影.
with the three
different eyeshadows.

64
00:03:18,516 --> 00:03:22,885
我说Joanie会拥有一辆很不错的守车(载货火车最后一节).
l will say that Joanie
had a nice caboose.

65
00:03:22,921 --> 00:03:25,481
Joanne, 爸.
她的名字是Joanne, 明白吗?
Joanne, Dad.
Her name was Joanne, all right?

66
00:03:25,523 --> 00:03:28,788
都一样, 这辆火车将不会靠站.
Either way, that train's not pulling
back into station.

67
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:33,688
关键问题是,
你会过得很悲惨.
The point is,
you were miserable.

68
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:36,393
我们欢迎你回到这里来
And we welcomed you back
into this house

69
00:03:36,434 --> 00:03:38,766
而且我们会再次让你得到心灵满足.
and we made you
whole again.

70
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:43,498
－ 记住这些了吗?
－ 嗯.
￡- Remember that?
￡- Yeah.

71
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:46,840
那现在你还想搬出去自己一个人过吗?
And now you want to go
out on your own again?

72
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:49,847
那不正是最明智的选择吗?
ls that really
the smartest thing?

73
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:55,717
那好.
疯狂的想法被摆平了.
Good.
Craziness settled.

74
00:03:57,689 --> 00:03:59,714
欢迎回来,
Welcome back,

75
00:03:59,757 --> 00:04:01,657
大仙.
Yogi.

76
00:04:04,362 --> 00:04:06,660
我们应该给你准备个野餐篮子.
We should get you
a picnic basket.

77
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:13,299
听好, 兄弟, 你的想法是对的.
你是应该搬出去住了.
Listen, man, you're right.
You got to move out.

78
00:04:13,338 --> 00:04:15,602
－ 我是准备从这里搬出去住.
－ 什么时候?
￡- l am gonna move outta here.
￡- When?

79
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,631
我准备好的时候.
When l'm ready.

80
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,004
好. 呆在这儿.
听天由命吧.
Fine. Stay here.
Do what you want.

81
00:04:22,046 --> 00:04:25,641
嗯, 我会去做我想做的任何事情的?
非常感谢.
Oh, l can do whatever l want?
Thank you very much.

82
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:28,174
我和你说过多少次了让你搬出去住了?
How many times
have l told you to move out?

83
00:04:28,219 --> 00:04:30,187
你总是能找到些站不住脚的借口.
You always got
some lame excuse.

84
00:04:30,221 --> 00:04:33,213
－ "我正为钱发愁呢."
－ 钱是个很好的借口.
￡- "l'm worried about money."
￡- Money is a good excuse.

85
00:04:33,258 --> 00:04:35,556
"我还只有33岁."
"l'm only 33."

86
00:04:35,593 --> 00:04:38,619
"他们让我在门上装个锁."
"我还只有37岁."
"They let me put a lock on the door."
"l'm only 37."

87
00:04:38,663 --> 00:04:41,655
你知道吗?
你不需要任何借口了.
Yeah, you know what?
You don't need any more excuses.

88
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,668
－ 我不会再让你帮出去了n.
－ 很好. 很棒.
￡- l'm not gonna tell you to move again.
￡- Good. Great.

89
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:46,727
好.
你余生都这样过着悲惨的生活吧
That's right.
Stay miserable for the rest of your life

90
00:04:46,771 --> 00:04:49,433
并且在犹豫是不是应该搬出去,
但是现在已经是太晚了
and wonder if you should've
moved out, but now it's too late

91
00:04:49,474 --> 00:04:51,772
因为你已经老了，顶也秃了，
并且还和爸爸妈妈生活在一起.
'cause you're old and bald
and living with Mom and Dad.

92
00:04:51,809 --> 00:04:53,401
最终你会发现
And you're gonna
find out

93
00:04:53,444 --> 00:04:57,346
对棒球来说，指定击球员并不好.
that the designated hitter
is bad for baseball.

94
00:04:57,382 --> 00:05:00,783
九名队员击球, 九名队员接球,
这就是游戏规则.
Nine guys hit, nine guys field,
that's the game.

95
00:05:00,818 --> 00:05:02,342
棒球就是按照这样的规则进行比赛的的.
lt's the way it was meant
to be played.

96
00:05:02,387 --> 00:05:04,787
哎，你会愿意和爸妈搬家到佛罗里达去
What, are you gonna move
to Florida with Mom and Dad

97
00:05:04,822 --> 00:05:06,619
然后住在退休村庄里?
and stay
at a retirement village?

98
00:05:06,658 --> 00:05:08,853
我不会飞上1500英里
l'm not flying
1 ,500 miles

99
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:10,861
去看你穿着短袜，拖着着凉鞋的.
to see you wearing
socks with sandals.

100
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:13,090
Ray,你怎么总是烦我?
Why are you
bothering me, Ray?

101
00:05:13,131 --> 00:05:16,191
因为你总是抱怨和他们生活在一起,
Because you're always complaining
about living with them,

102
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:18,327
但是, 喂, 看看现在谁还在这里.
but hey, look
who's still here.

103
00:05:18,369 --> 00:05:20,997
行了, 够了.
你怎么不去忙你自己的事情啊?
All right, enough.
Would you mind your own business?

104
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,439
我只是恨你像现在这样生活, 因为－－
l just hate seeing you
like this, 'cause￡-￡-

105
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,201
无论怎么说,
我和你一样.
whatever,
l like you.

106
00:05:33,384 --> 00:05:36,046
等等, Raymond.
妈, 请坐下.
Wait, Raymond.
Ma, sit down, please.

107
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:39,887
我有些话要和你说.
我要搬出去住了.
l've got something to tell you.
l'm moving out.

108
00:05:39,924 --> 00:05:43,690
－ Robby, 够了, 我已经听烦了－－
－ 妈, 妈.
￡- Robby, enough, l'm tired with￡-￡-
￡- Ma, Ma.

109
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,390
我感谢你为我做过的一切.
l appreciate everything
you've done for me.

110
00:05:50,468 --> 00:05:52,459
食物...
For food...

111
00:05:59,544 --> 00:06:01,512
饮料－－
for beverages￡-￡-

112
00:06:01,546 --> 00:06:03,343
行了, 行了.
Okay, okay.

113
00:06:03,381 --> 00:06:06,475
－ 坐下来吧, 我给你做些吃的.
－ 不用了, 妈.
￡- Sit, l'll make you something else.
￡- No, Ma.

114
00:06:06,517 --> 00:06:08,781
我已经下定决心了.
My mind's made up.

115
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:11,880
谢谢你,
Raymond.
Thank you,
Raymond.

116
00:06:11,923 --> 00:06:14,448
噢, 不用谢我.
Oh, don't thank me.

117
00:06:16,628 --> 00:06:19,062
－ 谢谢你.
－ 嗯.
￡- Thank you.
￡- Hmm.

118
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:24,595
为什么他要谢你?
Why is he thanking you?

119
00:06:24,636 --> 00:06:28,128
我把他的外套拿回来了.
l brought back
the jacket for him.

120
00:06:28,172 --> 00:06:31,232
－ 已经不早了.
－ Raymond!
￡- lt's late.
￡- Raymond!

121
00:06:32,844 --> 00:06:36,746
我非常激动，我从来没有象今天这样激动过.
l am so psyched. l have never been
psyched like this in my life.

122
00:06:36,781 --> 00:06:39,750
－ 嗨, Ray, 我发自内心地－－
－ 行了, 走吧!
￡- Hey, Ray, from the bottom of my￡-￡-
￡- Okay, go away now!

123
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:46,914
别激动, 别激动.
Easy, easy.

124
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,060
我要走了,
l'm walking
out of here,

125
00:06:51,095 --> 00:06:53,154
优雅地，慢慢地
nice and slow

126
00:06:55,867 --> 00:06:57,357
行不?
Okay?

127
00:06:59,304 --> 00:07:01,465
我们以后再谈这件事,
We'll talk
about this later,

128
00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:03,974
当你能够再次眨眼以后.
when you start
blinking again.

129
00:07:05,143 --> 00:07:07,111
－ 把他拦下.
－ 喂!
￡- Stop him.
￡- Hey!

130
00:07:07,145 --> 00:07:09,113
－ 他干了什么?
－ 让我走!
￡- What did he do?
￡- Let go of me!

131
00:07:09,147 --> 00:07:11,843
别跑.
这只会让事情更糟.
Don't try to run.
it only makes it worse.

132
00:07:11,883 --> 00:07:14,113
为什么你老是来搅和我们家的事情?
Why did you stick
your nose into our affairs?

133
00:07:14,152 --> 00:07:18,486
－ 谁给了你这权力的?
－ 你怎么敢的!
￡- Who gave you the right?
￡- How dare you!

134
00:07:18,523 --> 00:07:22,084
Robby是我留下的最后一件东西.
现在他就要离开我们了，都是因为你.
Robby's the last thing l have left.
Now he's leaving because of you.

135
00:07:22,126 --> 00:07:24,526
－ 哎, 我只是想－－
－ 噢, 你只是想!
￡- Look, l just thought￡-￡-
￡- Oh, you just thought!

136
00:07:24,562 --> 00:07:27,622
你有没有考虑过我呢?
Did you think
about me?

137
00:07:27,665 --> 00:07:30,759
你有没有曾经考虑过我呢?
Do you ever
think about me?

138
00:07:30,802 --> 00:07:32,963
对, 考虑过吗?
Well, do you?

139
00:07:37,642 --> 00:07:39,633
你考虑过吗?
Do you?

140
00:07:47,085 --> 00:07:49,815
我－－ 我不会忘记这件事的, Raymond.
l￡-￡- l'm not gonna

141
00:07:49,854 --> 00:07:52,823

－ 我也不会.
￡- Mom.
￡- Me neither.

142
00:07:52,857 --> 00:07:55,587
你? 你总是对他大喊大叫，说他应该搬出去住,
You? You're always yelling at him
that he should move out,

143
00:07:55,626 --> 00:07:57,594
让他感觉自己很失败.
making him feel
like a loser.

144
00:07:57,628 --> 00:07:59,994
我并不是真想让他搬出去.
l don't really
want him to go.

145
00:08:00,031 --> 00:08:02,397
如果他走了...
lf he goes...

146
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:04,424
就只剩下我和她了.
it's just me and her.

147
00:08:06,337 --> 00:08:08,669
& 我将脱离控制了，我－－ &
& l'm about to lose
control and l￡-￡- &

148
00:08:08,706 --> 00:08:10,799

￡- Hey there, Pop.
￡- Don't go!

149
00:08:10,842 --> 00:08:12,901
我爱你.

150
00:08:16,814 --> 00:08:19,840
喂，兄弟', 如果有什么我能帮你的,
Hey bro', if there's anything
l can ever do for you,

151
00:08:19,884 --> 00:08:21,943
你尽管告诉我，行么?
you just let me
know, all right?

152
00:08:21,986 --> 00:08:25,251
& 我就要脱离控制了，我想我会喜欢. &
& l'm about to lose control
and l think l like it. &

153
00:08:26,624 --> 00:08:29,286
你能不能别唱了!
You could stop singing!

154
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,198
想想好的一面吧,
On the bright side,

155
00:08:34,232 --> 00:08:36,792
现在你们可以买吊扇了.
now you can buy
a ceiling fan.

156
00:08:43,576 --> 00:08:46,204
嗨, 依人小鸟.
Hey, Snugglepants.

157
00:08:48,815 --> 00:08:51,807
哦, 今天可是不一般.
Oh man, what a day.

158
00:08:53,787 --> 00:08:55,914
我今天采访Ewing, 你知道的,
l had this interview
with Ewing, you know,

159
00:08:55,955 --> 00:08:59,186
他迟到了三个小时，我不得不等他.
and he was three hours late
and l had to wait for him.

160
00:08:59,225 --> 00:09:01,750
噢，我累了，亲爱的.
Oh l am tired,

161

164
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:26,579
－ 你在干什么?
－ 帮你放松啊.
￡- What are you doing?
￡- Trying to help you relax.

165
00:09:32,525 --> 00:09:35,585
哦 老天, 现在又开始做梦了.
Oh God, now the dreams
are gonna start again.

166
00:09:38,431 --> 00:09:40,592
别犯傻了.
Don't be silly.

167
00:09:41,968 --> 00:09:44,368
我当成做梦，
是希望你别再对我发疯了.
l take it this means
you're not mad at me anymore.

168
00:09:44,404 --> 00:09:46,634
我不会对你发疯的.
l can't stay mad at you.

169
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:51,404
你去看过Robby的新家吗?
Have you been
to Robby's new place?

170
00:09:51,444 --> 00:09:54,902
没有，他要一个星期时间来安置下来.
No, he wants a week there
to get settled.

171
00:09:54,948 --> 00:09:57,974
好的, 如果你去的话,
帮我拍张照回来.
Well, when you do go,
take a picture for me.

172
00:09:58,017 --> 00:09:59,985
我想他不会邀请我去的.
l don't think
l'll ever get invited.

173
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:02,920
妈, 你应该为他感到高兴啊.
Ma, you should
be happy for him.

174
00:10:02,956 --> 00:10:05,550
他感觉很好.
他感觉自己独立了.
He feels good.
He feels independent.

175
00:10:05,592 --> 00:10:07,560
进来吧, 小家伙们.
Come on, guys.

176

看看谁原谅我了.
Hey, Deb, guess what.
Look who forgave me.

179
00:10:15,635 --> 00:10:18,604
哦 很好啊.
Oh good.

180
00:10:18,638 --> 00:10:21,801
因为在我们生活中总会有困难的.
'Cause there was such a hole
in our lives.

181
00:10:24,744 --> 00:10:27,611
Robby离开我的最大好处
The only good thing
about Robby leaving me

182
00:10:27,647 --> 00:10:30,445
是我能有更多的时间来陪你们大家.
is l get to spend more time
with all of you.

183
00:10:36,623 --> 00:10:39,023
干衣机好了.

00:10:39,058 --> 00:10:42,653
Debra, 我发现你买了一些新的内衣了.
Debra, l noticed some new underwear
in there for you.

185
00:10:42,695 --> 00:10:45,163
要比一般的要暴露一些.
A little more revealing
than usual.

186
00:10:48,935 --> 00:10:51,495
把Robert 弄回来吧.

否则
就剩下我们和她了.
Otherwise
it's just us and her.

188
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:00,141
你愿意在这里出现不好的感觉吗?
Are you starting
to get a bad feeling here?

189
00:11:01,514 --> 00:11:03,607
我刚刚就开始有那种感觉了.

￡- We got the Baco Bits?
￡- Are you blind?

211
00:12:31,571 --> 00:12:33,835
如果这是一条蛇,
它就已经咬着你了.
lf this was a snake,
it would have bit you.

212
00:12:33,873 --> 00:12:37,206
如果它是一条蛇的话,
我宁愿吃它，而不去吃那炖肉.
lf it was a snake,
l'd eat it instead of that pot roast.

213
00:12:41,047 --> 00:12:43,538
嗨, Raymond.
你来这里有什么事情吗?
Hey, Raymond.
What are you doing here?

00:13:25,224 --> 00:13:28,318
独立生活, 嗯.
那么, 嗯...
On your own, yeah.
So, uh...

225
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:30,659
这地方会不会让你想起某个地方?
does this place
remind you of anywhere?

226
00:13:33,332 --> 00:13:36,631
有个当警官的兄弟，是不是感觉很棒, Raymond?
lsn't it great to have a brother
who's a police officer, Raymond?

227
00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:40,605

l know l feel much safer

或者被人注意.

Raymond?
Barone?
Raymond?
Barone?

231
00:13:49,182 --> 00:13:51,946
不会是 "Newsday"的Ray Barone吧?
Not "Newsday"'s
Ray Barone?

232
00:13:51,984 --> 00:13:55,545
－ 是的, 那就是我.
－ 好棒的家伙.
￡- Yeah, that's me.
￡- Holy crud.

233
00:13:55,588 --> 00:13:58,318

236
00:14:03,362 --> 00:14:07,196
我喜欢你写的任何东西.
你怎么没有和我说过你的兄弟是谁呢?
l love everything you write. How come
you didn't tell me who your brother was?

237
00:14:12,105 --> 00:14:14,437
一定是忘记了.
Must have
slipped my mind.

238
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,866
那么, 给"Newsday"写文章感觉如何?
So, what's it like
to write for "Newsday"?

239
00:14:18,911 --> 00:14:21,505
还好,
我想.
lt's okay,
l guess.

00:14:24,317 --> 00:14:26,217
而且这么谦虚.
And he's humble.

242
00:14:26,252 --> 00:14:28,049
Robert, 给Raymond留点吃的.
Robert, leave some

嗯, 我们到了.

249
00:14:51,043 --> 00:14:53,068
对的,它看起来再高兴不过了.
Yeah, he's never
looked happier.

250
00:14:54,747 --> 00:14:57,545
小伙子们, 我要去店里买冰激凌了.
Boys, l'm going to the store
for ice cream.

251
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,551
你们要吃点吗?
Do you want some?

252
00:14:59,585 --> 00:15:01,143
啊!
Aw!

谢谢你,  S女士.
Thank you, Mrs. S.

254
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:05,881
她很特别, 是吗?
She's one
of a kind, huh?

255
00:15:08,661 --> 00:15:10,686
是的, 没有人能够像她那样.
Yeah, no one else
like her.

256
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,326
听着.
Listen.

257
00:15:15,368 --> 00:15:17,427

￡- What the hell is that?
￡- Garage door opening.

259
00:15:27,847 --> 00:15:30,475
吓坏你了, 哈?
Scared you, huh?

260
00:15:30,516 --> 00:15:33,849
我要告诉你，第一次的时候Shamsky 把我的席子弄脏了.
l got to tell you, the first time
it went up Shamsky ruined my sheets.

261
00:15:36,289 --> 00:15:38,018

263
00:15:52,705 --> 00:15:55,196
我想你应该从这里搬走.
l think you ought
to get the hell outta here.

264
00:15:56,676 --> 00:15:59,668
不, 我已经习惯了.
我甚至都听不见这些声音了.
Naw, l'm used to it.
l don't even hear it anymore.

265
00:15:59,712 --> 00:16:02,613
不是说这个!
你看, Robert,
Not that!
Look, Robert,

266
00:16:02,648 --> 00:16:05,208
这里和家里并没有两样.
this place is no different
than home.

267
00:16:05,251 --> 00:16:07,981
你在说什么?
What are you
talking about?

268
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,318
这里是完全不一样的.
lt's totally different.

269
00:16:10,356 --> 00:16:12,722
我现在住在车库上面,
l'm above a garage,

270
00:16:12,758 --> 00:16:16,057
我在这里有个浴室,
l have a bathroom here,

00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,068
这里的人,
Stipe夫妇,
Those people,
the Stipes,

274
00:16:23,102 --> 00:16:25,502
如果你在其中一位上化更浓的妆，另一位体重加上30磅,
you put more make up on one
and 30 lbs. on the other,

275
00:16:25,538 --> 00:16:27,938
那就是咱爸咱妈了.
that's Mom and Dad.

276
00:16:29,675 --> 00:16:33,406
行了, Raymond,
他们根本就不象咱爸妈.
Come on, Raymond,
they're nothing like Mom and Dad.

277
00:16:33,446 --> 00:16:36,108
他们是犹太人.
They're Jewish.

278
00:16:41,921 --> 00:16:43,548
Amy认为这里怎样?
What does Amy

她有点对我看管的太紧了.
She kind of looks out
for me a little too much.

282
00:16:50,897 --> 00:16:53,764
S先生, 他不太喜欢说话,
And Mr. S., he doesn't
like a lot of talking,

283
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:56,267
除了他们吵架的时候.
except when
they're fighting.

284
00:16:56,302 --> 00:16:59,328
他们就不停地吵啊吵啊吵啊
And then they go on
and on and on

285
00:16:59,372 --> 00:17:01,738
我的天哪!
and oh my God!

286
00:17:06,178 --> 00:17:09,944
也许这不是我预想的重大生活改变.
Maybe this isn't the radical change
l had planned.

287
00:17:13,886 --> 00:17:16,616
不，也有变化啊.
你现在要支付房租了.
No, there's a change.
You get to pay rent now.

288
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,450
傻瓜 白痴 蠢猪!

No, look, maybe there's
something we can do.

291
00:17:24,897 --> 00:17:27,297
也许你可以...

搬回家住.

293

对自己好一点吧.
Yeah, make it easy
on yourself.

294
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,008
你看, 你已经表明了自己的想法了.
Look, you've made
your point here.

295
00:17:36,042 --> 00:17:39,739
另外, 假如你搬回家里住，
你知道谁会最开心? 妈妈.
Besides, you know who'd be really happy
if you moved back home? Mom.

296
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:42,805
那样不是更好吗?
为我们大家?
Wouldn't that be nice?
For all of us?

297
00:17:44,617 --> 00:17:48,348
那将是－－
Robert的家, 可以吃到sloppy Joes三明治.

Robert's home, sloppy Joes.

298
00:17:50,856 --> 00:17:52,824

我不能再呆在这里了.
You're right,
l can't stay here.

￡- Oh no, l'm not going home.

On my own,
no adult supervision.

那妈妈怎么办?
我是说, 她非常伤心，并且...
What about Mom?

All those years l stayed

307
00:18:18,217 --> 00:18:21,709
我并没有浪费我的生活，因为那是计划的一部分.
that l wasn't wasting my life
because it was part of a plan.

Stay at home,
save some money, meet a girl,

309
00:18:25,324 --> 00:18:29,226

00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,676
如果我回去, 我不得不承认我的计划就是泡影了.
lf l go back now, l have to admit
that my plan was nothing.

315
00:19:09,835 --> 00:19:11,894
你必须得找个你自己的地方.
You have to find
your own place.

316
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,480
妈妈让你抓狂了吧, 是不?

Who are you to come into our house
and take away that Robert?

328

我跟你说句话,
一流作家先生.
Let me tell you something,
Mr. Big￡-Shot￡-Writer.

我那里需要Robert.

家里就只有我和她了.
