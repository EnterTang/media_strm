
1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You embarrassed me.

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
- What are you talking about? - You embarrassed me.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So What?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000

You know everything about me.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Bets, I use our life all the time in my Work.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,000
They pay me for that.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And then you laughed.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You all laughed.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Must be so funny being in on it.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Come on.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You're taking this the Wrong Way.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You embarrassed me.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I’m sorry.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I didn't mean it.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You never mean it. You just do Whatever you Want,

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and I put up With it because nobody knows.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
No one is going to rember that. You know What they're going to remember?

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Petra Colson missing her chair.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Come on. Leave this. You're tired. Let's go upstairs.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I’m not going to bed.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Not until you tell me Why you insist on humiliating me.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I can't talk to you When you're like this.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You're making a mountain out of molehill.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I know about you and that Woman.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Damn it, Don, I know you're having an affair.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You and Bobbie Barrett.

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
How could you? She's so old.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Betty, that's ridiculous.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Go ahead. Tell me.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Jimmy told me everything.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
- He hates me. - He told me everything.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Please. What the hell did he say?

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So you can pick it apart? TWist all my Words?

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I’m not going to dignify Jimmy Barrett

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
With a response. He's a big mouth.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And don't pretend I don't know how he looks at you.

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I saW you tWo together.

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You think you know me?

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I know What kind of a man you are.

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You think I Would sleep With that Woman?

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You can't help yourself.

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Admit it.

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,000
There's nothing to admit.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You're lying.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I’m going to bed.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
