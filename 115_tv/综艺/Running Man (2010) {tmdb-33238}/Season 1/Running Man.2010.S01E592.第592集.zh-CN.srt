1
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,410
You have been found guilty of murder in the first degree.

2
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,640
I'm sentencing you to life in prison without possible release.

3
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,920
Noooooo!
I didn't kill anyone!

4
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,470
Good morning.

5
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,470
I'm not going to hurt you.

6
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,660
What is this?

7
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,770
You're not in prison anymore.

8
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,330
The world thinks you're dead.
Suicide.

9
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,010
This is your funeral.

10
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,220
Row 8, plot 30.

11
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,630
My momma... didn't come?

12
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,980
We've decided to give you another chance.

13
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:08,180
This is where you'll train. This is where you'll learn.

14
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,760
After two years, if everything goes well, you'll work for us.

15
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,140
Why me?

16
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,870
A woman with your looks, who can kill in cold blood...

17
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:25,570
I didn't, I didn't, I didn't kill anyone!

18
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,720
When you attack someone from behind, go for the kidneys.

19
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,450
It disables and they can't fight back. Consider that your first lesson.

20
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:50,200
- I don't want - I don't want lessons!
- We start tomorrow morning. 5 a.m.

21
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,070
And if I don't want to?

22
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,950
Row 8, plot 30.

23
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:15,040
- Where am I going?
- To meet your new mother.

24
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:19,820
So who are you? My father?

25
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,940
Wait here.

26
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,480
They seem to think you have potential.

27
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,700
Who's they?

28
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,290
Who are you?

29
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:20,840
I'm Madeline. They are Section One.
They own you now.

30
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,280
Didn't know I was for sale.

31
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,210
Please sit down.

32
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:42,360
If you want to live, it has to be on our terms.
So please, do sit down.

33
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:02,300
Look at yourself.
Admire yourself.

34
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,200
See your beauty.

35
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,600
You can learn to shoot.
You can learn to fight.

36
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,950
But there's no weapon as powerful as your femininity.

37
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,820
We're family now, Nikita.

38
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:55,970
- You're late
- Training went long

39
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:01,010
- Take a look at this.
- Van Vactor.

40
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:05,000
He's brokering an alliance between multiple anti-western terrorist groups.

41
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,830
Shining Path, Nezbolla, everyone from the Middle East to the Far East.

42
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:14,720
That doesn't make sense.
Half of them are enemies to each other.

43
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:20,520
But their biggest enemy is us.
He's coming here to put an operation in place.

44
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,410
Do we know the when and where?

45
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,750
No, but we think there's an itinerary downloaded onto a PDA.

46
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,750
Walter's on it, he'll update you.

47
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,910
Michael, about Nikita.

48
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,660
What about her?

49
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:46,120
I've been watching her.
She lacks discipline.

50
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,210
She needs a little more time.

51
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,500
It's been two years.

52
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:57,500
That's our policy.
We start making exceptions, we're no better than the CIA.

53
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,850
Cancel her.

54
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,710
I think that would be a mistake.

55
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,700
It would be a mistake to become emotionally attached to the material.

56
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,660
It has nothing to do with that.
I think she could be a good operative.

57
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,010
If she fails, you fail.

58
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:42,500
- How's it going?
- You tell me.

59
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:49,860
Have Madeline get something nice for you to wear. We're going out.

60
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:55,070
- What do you mean, going out?
- Dinner, tonight.

61
00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:00,470
- Why?
- You've earned it.

62
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,190
Madeline taught you well.

63
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,840
It's hard to believe I'm here.

64
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,090
Where else should you be?

65
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,840
I don't know. It's just that I lived on the streets for so long.

66
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,400
- Why did you run away?
- I didn't.

67
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:18,500
My mother preferred her new boyfriend.
And he didn't like me.

68
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:22,800
So she told me to get out.

69
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:29,170
- Sorry.
- Don't be. I never was.

70
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,180
You've come a long way, Nikita

71
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,550
I... feel...

72
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,620
Go on, say it.

73
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,610
Happy.

74
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,500
Really?

75
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:47,690
The blond haired man sitting behind me has a PDA in his briefcase. Get it.

76
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,820
How?

77
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,590
When you get the unit, don't leave through the front.

78
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,840
There's a window in the ladies room. Use that.

79
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,590
It leads to an alley. The car will be waiting.

80
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,980
I - I thought we were -

81
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:12,090
If you're not out of there in five minutes, the car will leave without you.

82
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:16,380
- I can't do this.
- Five minutes.

83
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:28,190
- If you don't mind, wait til I leave.
- Michael.

84
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,330
Open it!

85
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:32,330
I've got my men everywhere. You'll be dead in a matter of seconds.

86
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,390
You knew?

87
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:40,880
We had to see if you could improvise.
Did you get the PDA?

88
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:55,660
Why didn't you tell me... this was a job... instead of pretending?

89
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:05,540
No matter what state of mind you're in, you have to be able to perform.

90
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:13,200
You're sick. You don't want a person, you want a machine.

91
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,760
I can't do that.

92
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:20,960
You just did.

93
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,110
Let's go?

94
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:52,470
- What's this place?
- You'll see.

95
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,250
No. Not until you tell me what we're doing here.

96
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,450
Nikita, please.

97
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:29,920
- You live here?
- No. You do. It's your’s.

98
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,200
Mine?

99
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,170
I hope you like it.

100
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,890
What do you mean, mine?

101
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:54,630
Everything you need is in here - I.D., driver's license, credit cards.

102
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,750
Tell no one who you are or what you do.

103
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,500
Anyone asks, you're between jobs and taking some time to figure things out.

104
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,500
Your codename is Josephine.

105
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:52,050
- What do I do now?
- Wait.

106
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:54,120
How long?

107
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:02,000
It depends. Could be a day, could be a month.

108
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,940
Goodbye.

109
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:25,100
Hey. Hi, I’m, I'm Carla. I live across the hall.

110
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,400
Welcome to the building.

111
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,100
It's a coffee plant.

112
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,040
Who sent you?

113
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,540
Who sent me?

114
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:51,540
Listen, if, if this is a bad time for you,
I can- I can always come back later.

115
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:59,760
Carla?
Hi, I'm Nikita.

116
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,930
Hey.

117
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,810
Do you want to come in?

118
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,920
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

119
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,390
Okay.

120
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:30,400
I'm a carpenter. Yeah, I know, my mother still hasn't recovered from the shock of it all yet.

121
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,380
Whenever anyone asks her what I do, she tells them I'm an interior designer.

122
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,630
At least you like what you doing.

123
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:41,640
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, ever since I was a kid, I wanted to build stuff. So what do you do?

124
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:48,080
I'm-... I'm between jobs.
At the moment.

125
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:53,070
- Well what do you want to do?
- I don't know.

126
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:57,260
Hmm, well, you'll figure it out.

127
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,730
- Do you want to go get something to eat?
- Yeah, sure.

128
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:03,100
I know this great burger joint.

129
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:10,960
- Hello!
- Josephine.

130
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,480
Take off your clothes.

131
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:37,600
Okay, this opens like a normal lipstick.

132
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:43,710
This is your explosive right here. You jam it into the door,

133
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,070
and then you arm it right here.

134
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:10,880
Okay, target's name is Gideon Van Vactor. He's in Suite 2105 with his mistress.

135
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:16,800
We have a thirty-minute window. She's expendable, he's not. Take him alive.

136
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:21,000
Team One, you'll be the coolers on this one.
Stay in position as long as possible.

137
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:26,100
If you have to break, two pulses.
Team Two, you'll be working the rim.

138
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:32,200
Okay, one more thing.
We don't know what all these people are.

139
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,500
Be prepared for anything.

140
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,370
I need her now.

141
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,780
This is your com set.
Remember, try and keep your head still.

142
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,210
Team One in position.

143
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:24,000
Just two more on the left.

144
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,730
Good job, Nikita's confirmed. She has access to the room.

145
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,900
Housekeeping!

146
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,230
Now what?

147
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,470
Put the plastique on the door. And remember,
be quiet, he's in the next room.

148
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,980
On two!

149
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,350
Nikita, someone's coming in.

150
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:49,150
Who are you?

151
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,960
Hey, hey, hey - I'm leaving, I'm leaving now.

152
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:56,500
- Shoot him!
- What are you doing in this room?

153
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,150
Nikita, he's one of them. Shoot him.

154
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,500
Shoot him now.
Now Nikita, now!

155
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,600
Everyone abort! Get your teams off the perimeter now!

156
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:18,980
Let's move, let's move!

157
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,840
Get up.

158
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,940
Stand!

159
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:15,180
Section One is the most clandestine
organization on the planet.

160
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:25,180
It's our job to bring down the criminals
and terrorists that no one else can get.

161
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,560
I can't do what you want me to do.

162
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,450
Mistakes are not an option.

163
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:37,120
I can't pull the trigger.

164
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,360
Why not?

165
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:46,840
Because I'm not who you think I am.

166
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,920
I'm not a killer.

167
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,000
The moment I believe that, Nikita,

168
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,610
you're cancelled.

169
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:20,230
- I've got something!
- What is it?

170
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:23,170
It's Van Vactor.
He's on his way to the airport.

171
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:26,140
All right, find an intersecting point. Start sequencing.

172
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:55,010
- What's going on?
- Looks like a car accident.

173
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,030
It's a trap!

174
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:39,390
He's running!

175
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:44,810
Team Two and Three, neutralize the area. Team One, pursue.

176
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:46,200
He's in there.

177
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,700
Damn it.

178
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,700
We've lost team One.

179
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,350
Michael!

180
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:14,450
They don't work down here.

181
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,090
In here.

182
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,500
Why don't I know you?

183
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,900
See, I make a point of knowing my enemies, of which I have many.

184
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,310
Yes, I definitely would remember those eyes.

185
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:29,200
Okay, shall we end this misery?

186
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,270
Let's prolong the entertainment.

187
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:46,270
He's a friend of yours, isn't he?

188
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,870
Go to Hell.

189
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:55,660
Let's try something different.

190
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:09,540
Where do you come from?

191
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:35,720
You okay?

192
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,360
Josephine.
