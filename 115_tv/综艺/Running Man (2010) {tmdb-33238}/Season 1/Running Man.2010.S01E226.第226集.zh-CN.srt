Wow, I don't remember you
ever being on a variety show before?

28
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,893

30
00:02:23,284 --> 00:02:25,148

[Such elegance in her voice!]

34
00:02:37,767 --> 00:02:40,381
Are you wearing tennis shoes because you
knew you were going to be on Running Man?

35
00:02:40,382 --> 00:02:42,537
Yes, I wore my tennis shoes.

36
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:46,467
I don't think I've ever seen you
wear tennis shoes before.

37
00:02:48,112 --> 00:02:49,883
She normally wears the
old rubber shoes.

38
00:02:49,884 --> 00:02:51,799
[Huh?]

39
00:02:52,275 --> 00:02:55,221
When have you ever seen me
wear rubber shoes?

40
00:02:55,222 --> 00:02:57,413
In dramas and movies.

41
00:02:57,414 --> 00:02:59,844
She wore shoes
even in the movie, 'Country Diary.'

42

[Mini grasshopper, Tablo's wife.]

46
00:03:15,471 --> 00:03:19,359
I really wanted him to be on
the alien special you just had.

47
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,668
He really does look a lot like me.

48
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:25,245
And a member from the show,
Family Outing.

49
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,828
[A member from the Family Outing,
Lee Chun Hee.]

50
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:31,188
- He had Kwang Soo's role on that show.
- He passed his role onto Kwang Soo.

51
00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:32,578
[The original goof, and the new goof.]

52
00:03:34,428 --> 00:03:37,015
[Stay tuned for Chun Hee's
goofball antics.]

53
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:39,324
- Ms. Song Ji Hyo.
- Yes?

54
00:03:39,325 --> 00:03:42,310
- Didn't we film 'Goong' together?
- Yes, that's right.

55
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:45,703

00:03:45,704 --> 00:03:49,183
- Yes, that's true.
- She was pretty back then.

57
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:53,602
What are you talking about?
She's still pretty!

58
00:03:53,603 --> 00:03:56,891
When I say, 'just as pretty',
it means that she's still pretty.

59
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:01,101
[Kkuk is knocked out.]

60
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,557
[She's the best!]

61
00:04:03,558 --> 00:04:06,239
I never imagined a day
like this would come.

62
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,920
It's truly an honor to
have you here.

63
00:04:08,922 --> 00:04:11,123
I can't believe that she actually
came on our variety show.

64
00:04:11,124 --> 00:04:14,363
I used to think that she and Choi Bul Ahm
were a real married couple.

65
00:04:14,364 --> 00:04:17,070
- Yes, I used to think that, too.
- You've heard that before, right?

66
00:04:17,071 --> 00:04:19,994
Your speech is so old fashioned.

67
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,469
Your speech is so old fashioned.

68
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,411
[Old kiddo, Ha Ha is knocked out.]

69
00:04:26,982 --> 00:04:28,369
[Sorry...]

70
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,185
[Such unique and direct approach
in her speech.]

71
00:04:34,219 --> 00:04:38,189
- Are we just going to be talking on the show?
- No, we won't just be talking.

72
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,333
[I'm sorry to say that won't
be the case.]

73
00:04:40,334 --> 00:04:45,316
- I'm not going to be made to run, am I?
- You'll have to play the name tag elimination.

74
00:04:47,564 --> 00:04:50,480
- We'll have to rip off the name tags.
- Try ripping it off.

75
00:04:51,693 --> 00:04:54,105
- You have to rip it off really hard.
- There you go.

76
00:04:54,106 --> 00:04:57,965
- Then I'd be ousted from the game.
- Okay, then I won't rip it off.

77
00:04:58,803 --> 00:05:00,229
She says she won't rip it off then.

78
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,401
If yours gets ripped off,
then you'll have to go to jail.

79
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,311
[Jail?]

80
00:05:04,312 --> 00:05:07,241
- But Suk Jin and I'll be there, too.
- Okay.

81
00:05:07,242 --> 00:05:10,089
She's going to pull you off to the side
after we're done filming the show.

82
00:05:11,403 --> 00:05:14,921
- Rubber shoes and jail?
- I was just explaining the rules to her.

83
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:21,567
Today's race will be our Christmas special
since Christmas is just around the corner.

84
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,595
- It's like being with family.
- This is our Christmas special.

85
00:05:25,596 --> 00:05:28,217
[These special guests are like
a Christmas gift to them.]

86
00:05:28,218 --> 00:05:31,783
We have prepared a Christmas gift
that's geared more towards adults.

87
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:36,789
A prefect way to spend your Christmas,
Santa's Lottery Race.

88
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,244
Santa's lottery race?

89
00:05:38,245 --> 00:05:43,462
For this race, all ten of you will be teamed
up together to carry out the mission.

90
00:05:43,463 --> 00:05:47,863
With the completion of each round,
you'll be given a chance to win the lottery.

91
00:05:47,864 --> 00:05:50,605
The lottery drawing zone
is set up over on the side

92
00:05:50,606 --> 00:05:56,856
and Kim Hye Ja will pick the winning number
which will determine the prize amount.

93
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,289
With each mission that you win

94
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,740
you will be given a chance to
increase the amount of the prize

95
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:03,714
and if you fail the mission,
then you'll be given a disadvantage.

96
00:06:03,715 --> 00:06:08,913
Please do your best to succeed the mission,
and take home the magic of the holidays.

97
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:13,913
- If we win, then we get a prize.
- All of us?

98
00:06:13,914 --> 00:06:16,505
- Yes, everyone.
- We're all on the same team.

99
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:18,602
Think of it as a competition
against the producers.

100
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:22,532
So, those people are our enemies?

101
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:25,660
- Yes, they're the bad bastards.
- Think of them as our enemies.

102
00:06:25,661 --> 00:06:28,996
- You just called them 'Bad bastards.'
- Sorry, I meant, bad guys.

103
00:06:28,997 --> 00:06:33,663
I meant we're the good guys, and
they're bad. Sorry, please excuse me.

104
00:06:34,723 --> 00:06:36,983
[Whether we're good and they're bad,
we're all still on the same team.]

105
00:06:37,588 --> 00:06:39,532
[Gyunggido Division of 'Job World.']

106
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:44,050
The fact that Lady Kim Hye Ja is
here as a guest on Running Man

107
00:06:44,051 --> 00:06:46,915
- is truly an honor.
- She seems to be leaning on you a lot.

108
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:52,560
I really want to wear one of these jackets,
but I'm afraid that I'd sweat in it.

109
00:06:53,086 --> 00:06:56,481
But I see that you already have
your name tag stuck on your back.

110
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:00,547
You already have your name tag on.

111
00:07:00,548 --> 00:07:03,772
[You have to chat and laugh on Christmas
because it only comes around once a year.]

112
00:07:08,077 --> 00:07:11,940
- Merry Christmas!
- Santa's lottery race.

113
00:07:11,941 --> 00:07:15,600
Here's your first mission.

00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:20,856
You have to go and find an item that fits
within the category in the time limit given.

115
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:25,479
The mission will be carried out here.
Here's the category of the mission.

116
00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:31,511
Take a selfie picture with
an animal mask.

117
00:07:31,512 --> 00:07:33,928
[Animal mask?
A selfie?]

118
00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:36,535
You have to spread out and
find a different animal mask

119
00:07:36,536 --> 00:07:40,198
and take a selfie picture with everyone,
and all of you have to be in the shot.

120
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,080
- We'll start the clock now.
- Where do I have to go?

121
00:07:44,081 --> 00:07:46,523
- Where do we go?
- It's all within this building.

122
00:07:46,524 --> 00:07:48,517

- He said something about an animal mask.
- We have to take a picture with it on.

124
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:54,546
Ready, set, go!

125
00:07:55,884 --> 00:07:59,038
- Find one for her first.
- Find one and give it to her first!

126
00:08:00,395 --> 00:08:02,730
[All the members are making efforts
to take care of Lady Kim.]

127

[Gary discovers the rabbit mask.]

128
00:08:05,702 --> 00:08:07,858
There's the rabbit mask.

[But Big Sister Kim is already
in full search mode for a mask.]

131
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,514
Lady Kim!

132
00:08:18,515 --> 00:08:22,116
Take this and go wait for us.
We'll be right there.

133
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:24,942
But I'll keep searching, too.

134
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:27,931
[She can just go and wait...]

135
00:08:27,932 --> 00:08:30,061
[But she can't seem to quit her search.]

136
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:37,584
[She already seems acclimated
to the ways of Running Man.]

137

to take the picture in order to succeed.]

143
00:09:01,257 --> 00:09:05,503
Have people already searched
through here? Be honest with me.

144
00:09:06,065 --> 00:09:08,433
They've already been here,
haven't they?

145
00:09:09,277 --> 00:09:12,361

a place that's already been searched.

[Doing her best to find another mask when she

without a selfie stick.]

161

Where are you?

162
00:10:01,933 --> 00:10:03,471
[Everyone rushes back to
the mission site.]

163
00:10:04,243 --> 00:10:06,435
Hurry back!

164
00:10:06,436 --> 00:10:09,274
[Still waiting on five more people.]

165
00:10:09,721 --> 00:10:12,363
- Kwang Soo, you take the phone.
- We have to get everyone in the shot.

166
00:10:12,364 --> 00:10:15,478
[Human Giraffe sure comes in handy
at times like this.]

167
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:18,186
[Everyone except for Gary is back.]

168
00:10:18,927 --> 00:10:21,441
- Where's Lady Kim?
- She's down here.

169
00:10:21,442 --> 00:10:24,540
- Gary's not here.
- We just need Gary to come back.

170
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,634
Come on, Gary!

171
00:10:26,635 --> 00:10:29,299
[Hurry back, Gary.]

172
00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:32,991
[Rushes back to the group after
finally having found a mask of his own.]

173
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:37,315
[All ten are finally back together,
and rush to take the selfie.]

174
00:10:37,316 --> 00:10:39,913
[Squeezes in together
as tightly as possible.]

175
00:10:39,914 --> 00:10:42,498
- Stretch out your arm some more.
- Stretch your arm out.

176
00:10:42,499 --> 00:10:44,935
- Gary, you have to look up at the camera.
- Sit lower.

177
00:10:45,451 --> 00:10:47,869
Gary, lift up your head some more.

178
00:10:51,157 --> 00:10:52,862
[Lift up your head, Gary.]

179
00:10:52,863 --> 00:10:57,314
- The chicken head is too big.
- Lower the chicken head.

180
00:10:57,315 --> 00:11:00,421
- Suk Jin, lower your head even more.
- That's good.

181
00:11:02,925 --> 00:11:04,636
I think we got it.

182
00:11:04,637 --> 00:11:06,381
Ugh, it's hot.

183
00:11:07,281 --> 00:11:09,748
[Getting steamed up after only
one mission.]

184
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:13,639
What are you asking Lady Kim
to do here?

185
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,950
What took you so long to
come back, Gary?

186
00:11:18,941 --> 00:11:22,081
I'm sorry, Lady Kim.
I'll be better next time.

187
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:23,861
[I'm just kidding, Gary.]

188
00:11:24,352 --> 00:11:26,959
[Only eight out of ten are shown.
Mission fail.]

189
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,560
[Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo are out
of the shot. Mission fail.]

190
00:11:30,561 --> 00:11:34,654
[Where's Gary?
Mission fail.]

191
00:11:34,655 --> 00:11:36,872
- That's disappointing.
- I found three masks.

192
00:11:37,156 --> 00:11:39,935
- You found three masks?
- Yes, I found three masks.

193
00:11:39,936 --> 00:11:42,376
- But you're really bad at finding things.
- You're awful at finding things.

194
00:11:42,377 --> 00:11:45,576
But I was able to find the masks.
When it had nothing to do with winning.

195
00:11:45,577 --> 00:11:47,766
[His searching skills are at its peak when
winning a mission isn't hanging on the line.]

196
00:11:48,553 --> 00:11:52,097
- Lady Kim, we have to start running again.
- Yes, do not worry.

197
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:54,067
[Competitiveness is starting to peak
after only the first round.]

198
00:11:54,067 --> 00:11:56,620
- You're not mad at me, are you?
- Yes, she's angry.

199
00:11:56,621 --> 00:11:59,333
Why would you say that to her?

200
00:11:59,334 --> 00:12:02,702
Your next mission is,
'Weigh the Item'.

201
00:12:02,703 --> 00:12:06,792
You have to disperse and bring back
an item to weigh on the scale

202
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:10,391
and if the combined weight of your items are
more than 150kg, then you win the mission.

203
00:12:10,392 --> 00:12:12,049
The clock starts now.
Start!

204
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:15,139
- 150kg?
- We have to bring back something?

205
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,687
Jong Kook, bring back
the heaviest thing you can find.

206
00:12:18,893 --> 00:12:21,587
It has to be something that's
marked with an 'R' sticker.

207
00:12:21,588 --> 00:12:24,683
- It has to be 15kg per item.
- They have to be heavy items.

208
00:12:24,684 --> 00:12:27,158
- I'm sure they're all on the second floor.
- Right?

209
00:12:27,726 --> 00:12:31,107
[Her search radar is back on
with the start of the second mission.]

210
00:12:31,108 --> 00:12:33,232
I doubt they hid anything
in the trash cans.

211
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,883
I'd really like to find something, too.

212
00:12:41,745 --> 00:12:45,115
[The Human Opener opens up
every door that she comes across.]

213
00:12:46,493 --> 00:12:49,241
- Here's something!
- Is it something heavy?

214
00:12:49,242 --> 00:12:52,798
It needs to be heavier than this.
This isn't going to be heavy enough.

215
00:12:53,713 --> 00:12:55,175
Here's something!

216
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:59,731
- What's this? This is too light.
- Is it light?

217
00:12:59,766 --> 00:13:01,397
- It's toilet paper.
- Toilet paper?

218
00:13:01,398 --> 00:13:04,649
[Toilet paper is going to be
way too light.]

219
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,877
- Just take it back for now.
- Should I set this down?

220
00:13:08,415 --> 00:13:12,871
[No matter how many items are brought back,
only one item per person are allowed.]

221
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,237
Here's a tire.

222
00:13:15,238 --> 00:13:17,799
[Oh, that's going to carry some weight.]

223
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,871
I've found something!

224
00:13:20,513 --> 00:13:22,184
Ugh, why is this thing so heavy?

225
00:13:22,185 --> 00:13:24,471
How do I get back down?

226
00:13:30,251 --> 00:13:33,040
[Chun Hee, you haven't changed one bit...]

227
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,716
Lady Kim, this is kind of heavy.

228
00:13:35,717 --> 00:13:37,680
[Ha Ha passes the giant stuffed bear
over to Big Sister Kim.]

229
00:13:38,171 --> 00:13:40,859
- Go and wait for us.
- Okay.

230
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,954
Does this make me a selfish brat?

231
00:13:43,592 --> 00:13:46,421
I really need to find something myself.

232
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:56,951
- Lady Kim, just go! You can just go.
- Oh my goodness.

233
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:00,141
Oh my goodness, she's so strong.

234
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,147
How much does it weigh?

235
00:14:04,148 --> 00:14:06,660
10.8kg.

236
00:14:06,661 --> 00:14:10,091
Why can't I find anything?
Oh, I've found something!

237
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,120
I've found something!

238
00:14:18,121 --> 00:14:20,895
- Jong Kook, I've found something!
- What is it? Wow!

239
00:14:20,896 --> 00:14:24,393
Wait, what is it?
Okay, you can just push it.

240
00:14:24,394 --> 00:14:25,731
[A giant flower pot on wheels!]

241
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,707
- Here's something!
- What is it?

242
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,931
- It's kimchi!
- That's good.

243
00:14:31,932 --> 00:14:35,679
- Hey, I've got kimchi!
- Hye Jung, that's great!

244
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,303
- That's a sure thing!
- That's great!

245
00:14:38,304 --> 00:14:39,935
[Heavy and speedy!
Hye Jung makes a great discovery.]

246
00:14:41,729 --> 00:14:44,011
[Gary arrives back with his tire.]

247
00:14:44,012 --> 00:14:47,340
Put in on top of it.
That's a really big item.

248
00:14:50,215 --> 00:14:52,909
31.8kg!

249
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:55,809
[Jae Suk returns with the water jug in
one, and a dumbbell in the other.]

250
00:14:58,015 --> 00:15:01,019
[Hye Jung arrives with her
giant flower pot.]

251
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:04,675
That's really impressive.

252
00:15:04,676 --> 00:15:08,152
Oh my goodness,
I can't believe you found that.

253
00:15:08,153 --> 00:15:10,125
- No, one at a time.
- 18.5kg.

254
00:15:10,126 --> 00:15:11,240
[Hye Jung's giant flower pot- 18.5kg.]

255
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:14,020
- Here's a snowman!
- Where?

256
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,834
[He actually stops to pick up the snowman?]

257
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:20,868
[Some people just never change.]

258
00:15:24,601 --> 00:15:26,772
4.36kg.

259
00:15:26,773 --> 00:15:28,085
[The giant teddy bear- 4.36kg.]

260
00:15:28,538 --> 00:15:31,556
- 11.88kg.
- That's pretty heavy.

261
00:15:32,013 --> 00:15:35,365
- Only one item per person, Jae Suk.
- I just want to see which is heavier.

262
00:15:35,366 --> 00:15:37,391
[Jae Suk is planning on choosing
the heavier item of the two.]

263
00:15:37,392 --> 00:15:40,497
- Which one?
- They're both around 10.

264
00:15:40,498 --> 00:15:42,429
[Water jug- 9.8kg.
Dumbbell- 9.9kg.]

265
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,710
[How can the two items be so similar?]

266
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:46,497
How about this one?

267
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,678
[Chun Hee's blanket weighs 14.8kg.]

268
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:52,302
Jong Kook is bringing back a person.

269
00:15:52,303 --> 00:15:55,106
- Seriously? A person is marked with an 'R'?
- What?

270
00:15:57,024 --> 00:15:59,240
Oh my goodness.

271
00:16:00,132 --> 00:16:02,392
[Big Sister Kim continues to
be impressed.]

272
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:05,375
[Kkuk brings back a life sized mannequin.]

273
00:16:05,376 --> 00:16:07,931
I hope that the mannequin is heavy.

274
00:16:07,932 --> 00:16:10,942
The Santa can hold something.

275
00:16:10,943 --> 00:16:12,767
Press down on it.

276
00:16:12,768 --> 00:16:15,846
You can't press down on it.

277
00:16:15,847 --> 00:16:17,833
23.

278
00:16:18,787 --> 00:16:21,037
I'm just holding it steady
so that it doesn't fall over.

279
00:16:21,038 --> 00:16:23,864
We already know how much it weighs.

280
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,968
[You already know how
much it weighs?]

281
00:16:26,969 --> 00:16:29,303
- We already know the weight of it.
- Maybe he just had a nice meal.

282
00:16:29,304 --> 00:16:33,452
- We already know how much it weighs.
- 18.7kg.

283
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,435
- Okay, Lee Kwang Soo's turn.
- You brought back toilet paper?

284
00:16:37,436 --> 00:16:40,139
- It's really heavy toilet paper.
- You really are too much, Kwang Soo.

285
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,343
You should've just left it.

286
00:16:42,344 --> 00:16:43,719
[The weight of the toilet paper can
determine the outcome of the mission.]

287
00:16:44,272 --> 00:16:46,616
[Kwang Soo is practically standing
on top of the weight scale.]

288
00:16:50,296 --> 00:16:52,962
- Come back down, Kwang Soo.
- It didn't work.

289
00:16:54,152 --> 00:16:57,244
Oh my goodness... where are we
going to find something heavier?

290
00:16:57,245 --> 00:17:01,720
Your total record is... 131.56kg.

291
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:04,346
Whose item didn't weight over 10kg?

292
00:17:04,347 --> 00:17:07,294
I found your item for you.
You're really hurting my feelings.

293
00:17:07,295 --> 00:17:10,229
- I found your item for you.
- I found Lady Kim's item for her.

294
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:14,224
But that item didn't even
weigh 10kg.

295
00:17:14,225 --> 00:17:16,891
[I'm sorry.]

296
00:17:16,892 --> 00:17:19,931
You're the one who gave her an item
that didn't weigh enough.

297
00:17:20,403 --> 00:17:23,852
[Big Sister tries to uplift everyone's mood
by joking around about failing the mission.]

298
00:17:23,853 --> 00:17:26,616
The size may be big,
but it's not all that heavy.

299
00:17:26,617 --> 00:17:29,702
What is this? It's obvious
that it's not all that heavy.

300
00:17:29,703 --> 00:17:31,895
If this is what you're going to find for her,
then don't even find her anything.

301
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:35,132
[Thanks to Big Sister Kim,
everyone's still in good spirits.]

302
00:17:35,517 --> 00:17:38,677
- Are you having fun?
- Yeah, I want to become a fixed member.

303
00:17:38,678 --> 00:17:41,121
I'm just talking rubbish.

304
00:17:42,173 --> 00:17:46,808
Lady Kim says that she's having fun,
and she loves all the laughter.

305
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:51,261
She says she's having fun, and we
really love having you on our show.

306
00:17:51,262 --> 00:17:53,658
- Really? I'm really happy right now.
- Yes, we're serious.

307
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:57,319
[A cozy scene to warm up a
wintery season.]

308
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,193
- I like running without having to think.
- Me, too. Seriously.

309
00:18:00,194 --> 00:18:01,311
I really like running around.

310
00:18:01,312 --> 00:18:04,968
I want to run around like a fool
without having to think about anything.

311
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:12,105
Your next mission is,
'Create the number with the dice'.

312
00:18:12,106 --> 00:18:14,366
- This is all about luck.
- This game is about luck.

313
00:18:14,367 --> 00:18:17,069
There will be five couples of two

314
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,855
and each member will decide who will
be the single and double digit.

315
00:18:20,856 --> 00:18:24,183
For example, if the team rolls
a two and a five consecutively

316
00:18:24,184 --> 00:18:26,197
then the team will end up with 25.

317
00:18:26,595 --> 00:18:32,156
Then if the following couple rolls the dice
and the sum is bigger than the first couple

318
00:18:32,156 --> 00:18:33,999
then you succeed the mission.

319
00:18:34,034 --> 00:18:36,658
Then there will be five turns and
each will have to be bigger than the last?

320
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:40,579
- Then 66 will be the highest?
- Getting 66 in the middle will be a failure.

321
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,479
- Oh my.
- Don't mention failing already.

322
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,653
[Why would you mention that already?]

323
00:18:45,654 --> 00:18:49,168
- No, we can do this.
- This has potential.

324
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,156
Should people with bad luck
partner up together?

325
00:18:51,157 --> 00:18:52,985
Who has the worst luck
with things like this?

326
00:18:52,986 --> 00:18:55,652
- Chun Hee and Kwang Soo...
- Those two, for sure.

327
00:18:55,653 --> 00:18:58,240
- You, too.
- I'm pretty unlucky myself.

328
00:18:58,241 --> 00:19:02,264
- You guys should partner up together,
- It'll be the four of us.

329
00:19:02,265 --> 00:19:06,167
[Bad luck all-stars:
Chun Hee, Kwang Soo, Suk Jin, Jae Suk.]

330
00:19:08,566 --> 00:19:12,252
- We have the worst luck.
- We're famous for being unlucky.

331
00:19:12,253 --> 00:19:14,451
[Self-professed icons of bad luck.]

332
00:19:14,452 --> 00:19:17,109
Would it be better for the bad luck
guys to go first?

333
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:21,055
- What if we roll 66 right away?
- You guys are unlucky no matter what.

334
00:19:21,056 --> 00:19:23,353
Then how about we split up and
have one go first, and the other last?

335
00:19:25,688 --> 00:19:28,793
- First bad luck, and last bad luck.
- Split you guys up?

336
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:32,795
Since these two have bad luck,
and those two have filthy bad luck...

337
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:35,778
- We don't have filthy bad luck.
- Split them half and half.

338
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:38,596
- These two are really unlucky.
- Filthy bad luck.

339
00:19:39,269 --> 00:19:41,624
Why would you say that in
front of Lady Kim?

340
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:44,522
Family Outing, come over here.

341
00:19:44,523 --> 00:19:48,940
This is the original bad luck,
and that is the new filthy bad luck.

342
00:19:48,941 --> 00:19:51,406
He's just bad luck,
and I'm the other just bad luck.

343
00:19:52,604 --> 00:19:57,791
Is everyone teamed up in pairs?
Then hold hands with your partners.

344
00:19:57,792 --> 00:20:00,985
- Are you my partner?
- Yes, we have to go and find the dice.

345
00:20:00,986 --> 00:20:02,646
Ready, go!

346
00:20:05,617 --> 00:20:07,691
Keep your eyes open.

347
00:20:07,692 --> 00:20:10,583
[The two bad luck couples
are running side by side.]

348
00:20:11,403 --> 00:20:14,209
Let's go home.
We should go up.

349
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,793
They're going upstairs, too.
Bad luck people think alike.

350
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,140
All the bad luck people must think alike.

351
00:20:20,141 --> 00:20:22,471
[The two couples run up
to the second floor together.]

352
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:24,547
I don't see any dice.

353
00:20:25,777 --> 00:20:27,406
- I don't see any.
- Where could they be?

354
00:20:27,407 --> 00:20:30,429
Let's go back to the first floor.
I don't think there are any up here.

355
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,868
[Are they unlucky,
or are they just impatient?]

356
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:34,316
I think we should go back downstairs
and search to our right.

357
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:38,032
Why are you taking the elevator?
We don't have time for the elevator!

358
00:20:38,305 --> 00:20:41,777
[Big-nose Brother can't resist
the comforts of civilized age.]

359
00:20:41,778 --> 00:20:44,991
But an elevator would be faster
than taking the stairs.

360
00:20:44,992 --> 00:20:48,636
I'd like to see you in a name tag
elimination game against lady Kim Hye Ja.

361
00:20:48,637 --> 00:20:50,817
Have you found something?

362
00:20:50,818 --> 00:20:53,172
[Big Sister Kim has already
found something.]

363
00:20:53,173 --> 00:20:56,587
- Wow, we found something!
- There's something there.

364
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,410
- Oh my, no one saw the one in there?
- No, they must not have.

365
00:21:01,411 --> 00:21:04,510
- Should we try rolling it?
- This is just practice.

366
00:21:04,511 --> 00:21:06,966
- This is just for practice.
- Double and single digit.

367
00:21:06,967 --> 00:21:10,576
- We need to get the lowest number possible.
- Lower is better?

368
00:21:10,577 --> 00:21:12,264
[Lower is better.]

369
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,321
You can't throw it like that.

370
00:21:18,322 --> 00:21:20,426
[Big Sister Kim's new way
of throwing the dice.]

371
00:21:20,427 --> 00:21:23,225
- You're quite the jokester.
- You just rolled it to 'one.'

372
00:21:24,812 --> 00:21:26,966
- I found one.
- You did? Let's go.

373
00:21:26,967 --> 00:21:30,255
[Rushes back to the mission site
with her hand in Kkuk's hand.]

374
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:32,446
- We've found ours.
- Have you found it?

375
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,464
[All the couples are gathered back together.]

376
00:21:34,465 --> 00:21:38,596
You have to decide
which couple will go first.

377
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,139
Let's have Lady Kim Hye Ja go first.

378
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,742
Then Lady Kim will have the double digit,
and Jong Kook will have single digit.

379
00:21:43,743 --> 00:21:45,094
Okay.

380
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:48,094
- I need to get 'one', right? Should I go?
- Yes.

381
00:21:48,095 --> 00:21:50,193
[First couple to go,
with Lady Kim in the double digit.]

382
00:21:54,989 --> 00:21:57,386
[Oh no!]

383
00:21:58,215 --> 00:22:01,091
[Addition of a special rule-
Out of bounds, so doesn't count.]

384
00:22:01,092 --> 00:22:03,658
That was out of bounds!

385
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:06,340
[Big Sister Kim immediately
takes another turn.]

386
00:22:09,623 --> 00:22:15,091
[First couple's double digit is... one!]

387
00:22:15,092 --> 00:22:16,678
That's good, right?

388
00:22:18,535 --> 00:22:23,413
[Big Sister Kim gets them off
to a perfect start.]

389
00:22:23,414 --> 00:22:26,223
- That's great!
- Kim Hye Ja!

390
00:22:26,224 --> 00:22:29,837
- She's so cute.
- 11!

391
00:22:33,163 --> 00:22:35,078
Eleven!

392
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:40,299
[The lowest number- Eleven.
The best possible start.]

393
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:44,035
[Ji Hyo and Hye Jung's turn.]

394
00:22:44,036 --> 00:22:46,699
Ji Hyo's going first.

395
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:53,036
[Second couple, Ji Hyo and Hye Jung.
Single digit number.]

396
00:22:53,037 --> 00:22:57,401
- Please let it be one.
- Let it be one, let it be one.

397
00:22:57,402 --> 00:22:59,726
- Let it be one.
- Two!

398
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:03,714
[Second couple's number, 25.]

399
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:10,448
[Success.
25 is greater than 11.]

400
00:23:10,449 --> 00:23:12,545
- My turn. I'm going for the single digit.
- Is it the single digit number?

401
00:23:12,546 --> 00:23:19,981
[Third couple's single digit- Four.]

402
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:28,371
[In order for it to be greater than 25,
Gary needs to roll a three or higher.]

403
00:23:28,372 --> 00:23:31,524
One, two, three!

404
00:23:32,109 --> 00:23:36,363
[Third couple's double digit roll.]

405
00:23:36,364 --> 00:23:39,041
[Five.]

406
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:42,006
[Success]

407
00:23:42,007 --> 00:23:45,005
- Did you get 54?
- You need to roll 55.

408
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:50,317
- I need to roll 55 or higher?
- How about 61, and you roll 62?

409
00:23:50,318 --> 00:23:52,759
Who should go first?
Who do you think has worse luck?

410
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,688
Who looks to be most unlucky?

411
00:23:57,573 --> 00:24:00,281
[Points to Kwang Soo without
even a moment of hesitation.]

412
00:24:00,282 --> 00:24:02,593
- She thinks you look most unlucky.
- Should I roll first?

413
00:24:02,594 --> 00:24:04,832
Okay, this is the single digit.

414
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:09,216
[Fourth couple's first digit roll.]

415
00:24:09,217 --> 00:24:13,571
[One.]

416
00:24:13,572 --> 00:24:17,586
[The worst case scenario.
Must roll a six in order to succeed.]

417
00:24:17,587 --> 00:24:20,228
Why did you roll first?
Shouldn't we have agreed on it together?

418
00:24:20,229 --> 00:24:23,115
Why did you agree to go first?

419
00:24:23,116 --> 00:24:27,103
- Lady Kim told me to.
- You just asked me who looked most unlucky.

420
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:32,859
[Big Sister Kim only answered
the question asked.]

421
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,593
- No, she wasn't indicating to him.
- We're going to go first.

422
00:24:35,594 --> 00:24:37,420
[This is good!]

423
00:24:37,421 --> 00:24:39,259
- That wasn't your roll?
- No, it wasn't.

424
00:24:39,294 --> 00:24:42,339
I just threw it down in anger because I was
upset at her telling me that I looked unlucky.

425
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,670
- I'm sorry.
- Kwang Soo just threw it down in anger.

426
00:24:44,671 --> 00:24:48,552
[Kwang Soo jumped the gun
from his fit of anger.]

427
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:51,904
- Current number to beat is 54.
- We need to roll 56.

428
00:24:51,905 --> 00:24:58,358
[Must roll a number higher than
54 in order to succeed.]

429
00:24:59,385 --> 00:25:03,127
[Fourth couple's single digit throw.]

430
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:06,279
[Four.]

431
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,261
You can roll either a five or a six.
You can tie it.

432
00:25:08,262 --> 00:25:11,856
[Tie is accepted.
Must roll either a five or a six.]

433
00:25:11,857 --> 00:25:16,463
[Rolling a six would put a great
burden on the next couple.]

434
00:25:16,464 --> 00:25:22,477
[Must roll a five for the sake
of winning for all the members.]

435
00:25:22,949 --> 00:25:24,609
Please be quiet.

436
00:25:27,105 --> 00:25:29,623
I'm not in a good mood right now,
so just go away.

437
00:25:32,273 --> 00:25:33,799
I have to get a five.

438
00:25:38,168 --> 00:25:45,751
[Fourth couple's double digit toss.]

439
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:48,909
[Six.]

440
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:55,163
[Success.]

441
00:25:55,164 --> 00:25:58,030
- We did it.
- We're okay.

442
00:25:58,553 --> 00:26:04,617
[Must roll either 65
or 66 to win the mission.]

443
00:26:04,618 --> 00:26:07,155
Lady Kim, who should roll the single digit?

444
00:26:07,156 --> 00:26:09,571
The unlucky person should roll first.

445
00:26:09,572 --> 00:26:11,891
Then should I go first?

446
00:26:11,892 --> 00:26:16,448
- Yes, then I'll go first.
- You have two numbers you can land on.

447
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:19,245
You can roll either a five or a six.

448
00:26:21,749 --> 00:26:24,247
- Lady Kim, can you cheer for us?
- Fighting!

449
00:26:24,248 --> 00:26:27,655
- Fighting!
- If you lose, you'll be stripped naked.

450
00:26:27,656 --> 00:26:34,595
[Must roll either 65 or 66 to succeed.]

451
00:26:35,977 --> 00:26:47,599
[The last couple's single digit toss.]

452
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,034
[6]

453
00:26:50,035 --> 00:26:52,649
[First phase is a success.]

454
00:26:53,837 --> 00:27:02,947
[No other choice but to roll
a six in order to succeed.]

455
00:27:02,948 --> 00:27:05,339
I feel so pressured right now.
Why am I put in this position?

456
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,933
Let's just go for six, okay?

457
00:27:07,934 --> 00:27:09,758
- Six!
- Roll a six.

458
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:11,966
Toss it really high into the air.

459
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:16,798
- All my new year's luck is going into this.
- If you lose, I'm stripping you naked.

460
00:27:18,478 --> 00:27:21,178
- Lady Kim, give me a cheer.
- Fighting!

461
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,856
- One more time!
- Fighting!

462
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:28,057
[Yes, this is a real cheer!]

463
00:27:30,038 --> 00:27:33,570
[Only six will be acceptable!]

464
00:27:34,471 --> 00:27:36,020
Let's go!

465
00:27:38,232 --> 00:27:43,604
[What will be the last couple's
double digit number?]

466
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:53,131
[1]

467
00:27:58,239 --> 00:28:02,952
[A failed mission.]

468
00:28:02,953 --> 00:28:06,160
Wow, we've set it all up for you,
and you've just kicked our victory away.

469
00:28:06,161 --> 00:28:08,827
[He needed a six,
but he rolls a one instead.]

470
00:28:08,828 --> 00:28:10,437
No, it's okay.

471
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:15,507
He said it's with next year's good luck,
but he's just using up next year's bad luck.

472
00:28:15,886 --> 00:28:20,102
[Big Sister Kim's words of comfort.]

473
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:24,117
Since this was so much fun,
how about playing it one more time?

474
00:28:24,118 --> 00:28:26,137
- Really?
- Look, it's a six.

475
00:28:26,449 --> 00:28:29,545
That's why you're so unlucky.
You're just really unlucky.

476
00:28:29,546 --> 00:28:31,125
[Big-nose throws it again.]

477
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,897
- He's going to keep rolling a six.
- See?

478
00:28:32,898 --> 00:28:34,949
[Another six.]

479
00:28:35,263 --> 00:28:38,297
I get a one when I needed a six.
Wow, seriously.

480
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:43,496
[Fails the mission so close to winning
because of Big-nose's misfortune.]

481
00:28:43,497 --> 00:28:46,226
[Maybe I'll have better luck next year.]

482
00:28:46,227 --> 00:28:48,613
Please give us our next mission.
This is our last chance, isn't it?

483
00:28:48,614 --> 00:28:51,181
This is your last chance.
Here's your next mission.

484
00:28:51,955 --> 00:28:53,635
It's 'Spin the Hoola Hoop'.

485
00:28:53,636 --> 00:28:56,981
Everyone must find and bring back
hoola hoops of various sizes

486
00:28:57,016 --> 00:29:00,013
and if everyone can last for three seconds
doing the hoola hoop, then it's a win.

487
00:29:00,014 --> 00:29:02,050
- Ugh, this is bad.
- You may get started.

488
00:29:02,051 --> 00:29:04,486
Ugh, what are we going to do?
I can't do the hoola hoop.

489
00:29:04,487 --> 00:29:07,177
- I'm really bad at this.
- There's one!

490
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:09,705
- Give that to Lady Kim.
- Give that to Lady Kim.

491
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,549
- Give her the small one.
- Will this size be okay?

492
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,575
- I can't even do it. I should practice.
- Give it a try.

493
00:29:15,026 --> 00:29:18,383
I've never done this before,
so I don't think I'll be able to do it.

494
00:29:18,711 --> 00:29:20,953
Would it help if I held
your coat in the back?

495
00:29:20,954 --> 00:29:23,377
- In case it gets caught in your coat?
- Everyone's watching.

496
00:29:25,695 --> 00:29:29,290
- It's because it got caught in your coat.
- I'm not doing it. It's too embarrassing.

497
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:31,611
- Will a bigger one be better?
- I don't know.

498
00:29:31,612 --> 00:29:34,829
- I've never done this before.
- I'm really bad at this, too.

499
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:37,565
No, I bet you're good at it.

500
00:29:37,566 --> 00:29:39,576
Ugh, this is bad.

501
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:41,715
Lady Kim, you're really good!

502
00:29:41,716 --> 00:29:43,081
Do you like that one,
or this one better?

503
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:44,530
- This one is better.
- Then you can have that one.

504
00:29:44,531 --> 00:29:46,492
- Okay, thank you.
- You're good at it.

505
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,936
- No, I'm not good.
- This isn't working. I'm in trouble.

506
00:29:50,784 --> 00:29:55,037
[Closes the door to practice by herself
out of her embarrassment.]

507
00:30:01,108 --> 00:30:03,823
[Our Big Sister Kim is as sweet
and bright as a young child.]

508
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:08,884
[Everyone finds their hoola hoops
and gathers together to practice.]

509
00:30:08,885 --> 00:30:12,051
I don't want to do it by myself.
Let's all do it together.

510
00:30:14,933 --> 00:30:17,323
[Starts the group practice session.]

511
00:30:18,298 --> 00:30:20,870
I'm too embarrassed to do this.

512
00:30:20,871 --> 00:30:24,491
- I think a heavier one would be better.
- How about spinning it with your arm?

513
00:30:24,492 --> 00:30:26,440
How about spinning it around my neck?

514
00:30:26,441 --> 00:30:27,901
[Spinning it around the arm or
the neck will also be accepted.]

515
00:30:27,902 --> 00:30:30,517
- How about spinning it around the arm?
- That's fine.

516
00:30:35,576 --> 00:30:37,445
That was done on purpose, right?

517
00:30:37,446 --> 00:30:40,108
[Bringing lots of laughter to everyone.]

518
00:30:40,109 --> 00:30:44,622
Okay, let's get started.
You just need to spin it around.

519
00:30:44,623 --> 00:30:46,907
- Okay, let's do this.
- This is your final chance.

520
00:30:46,908 --> 00:30:49,097
[Santa's Lottery Race- First mission.
Final chance.]

521
00:30:49,098 --> 00:30:51,416
- Wouldn't a heavier one be better for her?
- Would you like this one or that one?

522
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:54,320
I'm going to do this one.
No, give me back that one.

523
00:30:54,821 --> 00:30:57,856
Why would you put me in
such a difficult spot like this?

524
00:30:58,222 --> 00:31:02,809
- You're seriously too much.
- Ready... go!

525
00:31:06,166 --> 00:31:08,738
[No more chances will be given!]

526
00:31:08,739 --> 00:31:11,667
[Must last for three seconds!]

527
00:31:15,801 --> 00:31:18,605
[Big Sister Kim gives everything
she has into spinning her hoop!]

528
00:31:19,885 --> 00:31:23,651
[3.08 seconds.
Barely succeeds the mission!]

529
00:31:24,811 --> 00:31:28,899
[Barely manages to clear the mission
thanks to Big Sister Kim's big efforts.]

530
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:34,941
[Big Sister Kim's leadership guides
the team into winning the mission.]

531
00:31:36,242 --> 00:31:41,300
Since you've succeeded you mission,
as mentioned, the drawing zone is over there.

532
00:31:41,301 --> 00:31:45,379
Getting there within 20 seconds will be
greatly advantageous for you. Get going!

533
00:31:46,912 --> 00:31:48,620
We have to rush over there.

534
00:31:48,621 --> 00:31:50,473
This way.

535
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:56,166
[Everyone must get there within
20 seconds for it to be a success.]

536
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:06,726
[Everyone's holding Big Sister Kim's
hand to help her along.]

537
00:32:10,735 --> 00:32:13,751
Mom and dad to little kids
are always the fastest.

538
00:32:13,752 --> 00:32:16,978
- Because we never know what could happen.
- Always on the move.

539
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,939
I'm keeping your place for you.

540
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:24,430
[All the members arrive
at the drawing zone.]

541
00:32:26,572 --> 00:32:30,237
[A drawing machine sits
in the middle of the drawing zone.]

542
00:32:30,238 --> 00:32:33,477
[What is the meaning of
these balls?]

543
00:32:33,478 --> 00:32:35,298
I'll explain the drawing rules for you.

544
00:32:35,856 --> 00:32:42,182
During the race, you will draw from
the machine at the end of each mission.

545
00:32:42,183 --> 00:32:45,899
There are a total of seven figures
which you'll be drawing for.

546
00:32:46,146 --> 00:32:50,559
Since it's the end of the first mission,
you'll draw for the 10,000 Won spot.

547
00:32:50,899 --> 00:32:53,302
- For the 10,000 Won?
- Yes, for the 10,000 Won spot.

548
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:57,598
If you draw a zero,
then you've drawn zero Won.

549
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:00,771
But if you draw a nine,
then you've drawn 90,000 Won.

550
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:05,381
- I think they're going to give us money.
- There are numbers zero through nine.

551
00:33:05,382 --> 00:33:08,238
Then the highest number possible
would be all nines?

552
00:33:08,239 --> 00:33:13,475
If you were to pick all nines,
then you'd get 999 million Won.

553
00:33:13,476 --> 00:33:15,764
I said that you needed to
get here within 20 seconds

554
00:33:15,765 --> 00:33:17,435
but it took you 38 seconds to get here.

555
00:33:17,436 --> 00:33:19,839
We lost time because we were helping
Lady Kim on the way here.

556
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,670
So there won't be any additional balls.

557
00:33:21,671 --> 00:33:24,381
- If you had arrived within 20 seconds...
- That's okay though, isn't it?

558
00:33:24,382 --> 00:33:27,842
- You could've added another nine ball.
- That's okay, Lady Kim.

559
00:33:27,843 --> 00:33:29,099
[Arriving within 20 seconds would've
added another nine ball into the mix.]

560
00:33:29,849 --> 00:33:33,771
[After the success of first mission,
can choose from 1-9 balls.]

561
00:33:35,178 --> 00:33:37,183
[The balls are rolling around with gusto.]

562
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:43,973
[Which numbered ball
will they choose for the first slot?]

563
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:49,770
[Number eight!]

564
00:33:51,504 --> 00:33:56,574
[With the draw of the first number,
80,000 Won is earned.]

565
00:33:59,107 --> 00:34:00,768
80,000 Won.

566
00:34:00,769 --> 00:34:05,080
You have drawn 80,000 Won so far
in the Santa's lottery drawing.

567
00:34:05,451 --> 00:34:09,530
[Will this happy start continue on
until the end of the race?]

568
00:34:15,009 --> 00:34:17,981
[The greatest gift is the ability to
share the joy with others.]

569
00:34:18,404 --> 00:34:22,384
- I think Lady Kim really likes you.
- I'm her eldest son.

570
00:34:22,385 --> 00:34:24,302
- Why are you her eldest son?
- Won Bin is her second eldest.

571
00:34:24,975 --> 00:34:28,334
[Everyone is each other's siblings.]

572
00:34:29,795 --> 00:34:33,126
She's just amazed to see people like you
after seeing someone as handsome as Won Bin.

573
00:34:34,825 --> 00:34:38,316
- I really enjoyed watching your drama.
- You are such an amazing actress.

574
00:34:38,656 --> 00:34:42,182
You played a mother who believed
in her son all the way to the end.

575
00:34:42,183 --> 00:34:45,400
Even if a son were to do such a thing,
his mother would always believe in him.

576
00:34:45,401 --> 00:34:47,472
Because she's his mom.

577
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:57,168
[Santa's Lottery Race- Second mission]

578
00:34:57,169 --> 00:34:59,734
- It's a Bingo Quiz.
- Bingo?

579
00:34:59,735 --> 00:35:01,610
- Bingo Quiz.
- Bingo quiz?

580
00:35:02,031 --> 00:35:03,745
If you look behind you...

581
00:35:05,996 --> 00:35:07,788
- Why are there so many numbers?
- There are so many spaces!

582
00:35:07,789 --> 00:35:10,387
There are nine spaces across,
and nine spaces down.

583
00:35:10,388 --> 00:35:13,286
There are a total of 81 spaces
with corresponding answers.

584
00:35:13,287 --> 00:35:15,120
Why are there so many questions?

585
00:35:15,121 --> 00:35:19,526
One person will ask the questions
and the remaining nine will answer

586
00:35:19,527 --> 00:35:24,214
to complete at least one bingo line
in order to win the mission.

587
00:35:24,215 --> 00:35:26,833
[Even one completed bingo line
would equate to winning the mission.]

588
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:30,883
[All nine members must correctly
answer the question.]

589
00:35:34,604 --> 00:35:37,870
[What's with the expression
on their faces?]

590
00:35:37,871 --> 00:35:43,620
The topic of this quiz is 'Popular
toy items for this year's Christmas'.

591
00:35:45,178 --> 00:35:47,551
That should be easy since
this isn't about general knowledge.

592
00:35:47,552 --> 00:35:49,820
This is just about things.

593
00:35:49,855 --> 00:35:52,576
Since we're already on this subject,
what is it that you'd like, Gary?

594
00:35:52,577 --> 00:35:55,242
Oh my, there's a Gary here?

595
00:35:55,243 --> 00:35:57,938
Oh my, I'm sorry.

596
00:35:57,939 --> 00:36:02,920
Gary is the name of the dog
in my movie.

597
00:36:05,061 --> 00:36:07,254
[This is that Gary.]

598
00:36:07,255 --> 00:36:12,057
- I'm in your movie?
- Wally's real name is Gary.

599
00:36:12,058 --> 00:36:13,602
[Wally's real name is Gary.]

600
00:36:13,603 --> 00:36:15,533
Whatever the case,
it's nice to make your acquaintance.

601
00:36:15,988 --> 00:36:18,528
Is there anything
that you'd like for Christmas?

602
00:36:18,529 --> 00:36:22,873
Me?
Well, I... I want to be loved.

603
00:36:24,264 --> 00:36:27,921
[A working mom's humble wish.]

604
00:36:29,806 --> 00:36:31,463
What about you, Chun Hee?

605
00:36:31,463 --> 00:36:32,987
I want a laptop.

606
00:36:33,814 --> 00:36:36,556
You don't have one?

607
00:36:38,225 --> 00:36:40,325
- I just want a new one.
- Just buy one.

608
00:36:40,326 --> 00:36:43,805
Why would you buy a laptop
if you already have one?

609
00:36:45,107 --> 00:36:47,910
Lady Kim sounded like
she really pitied him when she said

610
00:36:47,911 --> 00:36:50,083
'Do you not have one?'

611
00:36:51,427 --> 00:36:54,312
Chun Hee, she must've
found you really pitiful.

612
00:36:54,313 --> 00:36:56,991
[Maybe this mother may just buy him
his new laptop.]

613
00:36:56,992 --> 00:37:00,838
- I'll ask the first question.
- Okay, Ha Ha can ask the questions.

614
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:05,090
- Then I'll answer the first question.
- I'll answer the eighth question.

615
00:37:05,091 --> 00:37:09,721
- I'll go after Ji Hyo.
- Lady Kim can go last.

616
00:37:10,345 --> 00:37:13,279
That way, you can see how others
are doing it in front of you.

617
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,719
Yes, I can do that.

618
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,462
Then you can see how things progress,
and you can gauge how it's done.

619
00:37:19,463 --> 00:37:25,655
Okay, then you must now decide which
line you're going to go for.

620
00:37:25,656 --> 00:37:29,059
- Number one!
- Let's just start from the beginning.

621
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:31,370
- Let's start with one and go diagonal.
- Yes.

622
00:37:32,018 --> 00:37:34,447
- Yes.
- From one through nine.

623
00:37:34,448 --> 00:37:37,248
- Let's get this done on first try.
- Fighting!

624
00:37:37,249 --> 00:37:41,181
- Fighting!
- Let's get this done on first try.

625
00:37:41,182 --> 00:37:44,209
- Let's get this done on first try.
- I'm so nervous.

626
00:37:44,865 --> 00:37:46,790
[100 seconds on the clock.
Bingo Quiz- First attempt.]

627
00:37:46,791 --> 00:37:52,727
The thing that beeps from the front
and back in the newer suv's...

628
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:56,075
The front and rear sensors.

629
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:58,119
[She got that on first try?]

630
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:05,221
New front and rear sensor
equipped SUV!

631
00:38:08,457 --> 00:38:11,797
[Huh?
Blank Ji is actually this smart?]

632
00:38:12,603 --> 00:38:15,494
- Okay, move up.
- You knew all that?

633
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:19,659
I don't know any of that stuff.

634
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:22,188
What's your favorite tree?

635
00:38:22,189 --> 00:38:23,938
An ash tree?

636
00:38:24,271 --> 00:38:27,107
[Huh? What tree?]

637
00:38:27,591 --> 00:38:29,765
[Ash... what?]

638
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:31,815
- He likes ash trees?
- Yes, ash trees.

639
00:38:31,816 --> 00:38:35,705
- How big of a family do you want to have?
- Six.

640
00:38:35,706 --> 00:38:37,681
Right?
Then combine all that together.

641
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:41,845
A six person table
made out of ash trees?

642
00:38:41,846 --> 00:38:44,700
- A six person table?
- Okay!

643
00:38:46,025 --> 00:38:47,538
What is it?

644
00:38:48,235 --> 00:38:51,012
- The questions are so easy.
- You like six person tables?

645
00:38:52,992 --> 00:38:59,947
[Have they always been this smart?]

646
00:39:00,923 --> 00:39:03,755
[Just what is this situation?]

647
00:39:05,689 --> 00:39:09,093
[Two hours before the opening.]

648
00:39:09,625 --> 00:39:11,511
[A bakery near the opening scene.]

649
00:39:11,512 --> 00:39:16,789
- There's one more guest that'll be coming.
- Really?

650
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:20,852
- There's one more guest?
- There's a reason why you all are here.

651
00:39:20,887 --> 00:39:27,461
We've asked you to meet here because there's
a secret mission that you'll have to do.

652
00:39:27,964 --> 00:39:30,460
- You'll be asked to play a Bingo Quiz.
- Bingo quiz?

653
00:39:30,461 --> 00:39:36,651
There'll be a hidden camera mission in which
only Lady Kim Hye Ja will get a question wrong

654
00:39:36,686 --> 00:39:42,000
and deter the team from getting a bingo line,
and that's how you'll succeed the mission.

655
00:39:42,001 --> 00:39:47,229
If Lady Kim guesses during the mission
that there's a hidden camera

656
00:39:47,264 --> 00:39:52,126
or if she correctly guesses the answer
to complete a bingo line

657
00:39:52,127 --> 00:39:55,008
then you will all fail
the hidden camera mission.

658
00:39:55,009 --> 00:39:58,951
And if you fail to answer the question
correctly, then you also fail the mission.

659
00:39:58,952 --> 00:40:05,584
Please take a look at the bingo questions
and do you best to memorize the answers.

660
00:40:05,585 --> 00:40:07,141
[These nine members will now have to
work to memorize all the answers.]

661
00:40:07,142 --> 00:40:10,710
- We have to study again?
- You'll be given the time to study right now.

662
00:40:10,711 --> 00:40:13,759
- Please start studying.
- These are the questions.

663
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,046
- And these are the questions.
- How am I supposed to know these answers?

664
00:40:18,047 --> 00:40:20,754
[The questions and its corresponding
answers sound like alien language.]

665
00:40:20,755 --> 00:40:24,420
- How am I supposed to know this?
- These are hard questions.

666
00:40:24,421 --> 00:40:25,437
Listen to this.

667
00:40:25,438 --> 00:40:29,914
The jacket that boasts its waterproof feature
as well as for being lightweight and warm?

668
00:40:29,915 --> 00:40:34,768
- Is it goose down?
- No, ultralight down jacket with padding.

669
00:40:35,146 --> 00:40:39,182
[How are we supposed to know this?]

670
00:40:39,183 --> 00:40:45,451
- I've never met Lady Kim Hye Ja before.
- I've never met her either.

671
00:40:45,452 --> 00:40:50,444
She's like a sweet young girl.
To be honest, I doubt she'll know these.

672
00:40:50,445 --> 00:40:53,281
I doubt she'll know what a six cylinder
battery series engine is.

673
00:40:53,282 --> 00:40:56,535
What is she knows?
'This is a six cylinder battery series engine.'

674
00:40:57,479 --> 00:40:59,959
She could have a lot of interest in cars.

675
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,353
- She could know this.
- Maybe she likes sports cars.

676
00:41:03,415 --> 00:41:07,761
- We need to come up with a good plan.
- We need to be detailed about this.

677
00:41:07,762 --> 00:41:12,138
- Should we go up or down?
- It could be diagonal, too.

678
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:14,299
- There's a diagonal line.
- Let's go diagonally.

679
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,037
Just think about it.

680
00:41:16,038 --> 00:41:18,557
- Come on.
- Do you not have a brain?

681
00:41:19,404 --> 00:41:22,895
- Just do it.
- It's because you seem to lack a brain.

682
00:41:22,896 --> 00:41:25,973
- You must not use your brain very much.
- Excuse me?

683
00:41:25,974 --> 00:41:29,481
Do you think that my brain
is just for decoration?

684
00:41:29,999 --> 00:41:32,697
[Unstable factor number one-
Members can't seem to agree on anything.]

685
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:36,209
- We just need to memorize one line.
- That's what I'm saying.

686
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:38,963
- Let's just memorize one line.
- That's what I'm saying!

687
00:41:38,964 --> 00:41:40,212
[How many times must we repeat
saying the same thing?]

688
00:41:40,213 --> 00:41:43,344
[There seems to be no sign
of any progress at this meeting.]

689
00:41:43,345 --> 00:41:45,370
We're just going to give up
on this mission.

690
00:41:46,622 --> 00:41:51,491
- Do we just need one bingo line?
- If you get a bingo line, then you fail.

691
00:41:51,492 --> 00:41:53,487
We have to get a bingo?

692
00:41:53,488 --> 00:41:57,062
No, we can't get a bingo line.
If we do, then we fail the mission.

693
00:41:57,063 --> 00:41:58,726
[30th time explaining the rules of the game.]

694
00:42:00,906 --> 00:42:02,692
What do you think, Chun Hee?

695
00:42:03,466 --> 00:42:05,647
I'm not really sure what's going on yet.

696
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:08,671
You didn't know during Family Outing,
and you still don't know. When will you know?

697
00:42:09,213 --> 00:42:12,426
[Unstable factor number two-
Goofy Brothers can't understand the mission.]

698
00:42:12,427 --> 00:42:15,011
At this rate, we're not going to get back
in time to greet Lady Kim Hye Ja.

699
00:42:16,115 --> 00:42:18,727
[They waste away all their study time...]

700
00:42:18,728 --> 00:42:20,311
[And now they rush.]

701
00:42:26,558 --> 00:42:29,240
[Are they studying for their SAT's?]

702
00:42:29,241 --> 00:42:33,303
Isn't there a single smart person here?
This shouldn't be this difficult.

703
00:42:33,304 --> 00:42:36,746
It's just because none of us like to study.

704
00:42:36,747 --> 00:42:39,141
- This is too bothersome.
- Seriously!

705
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:43,052
[Unstable factor number three-
Members are too lazy to study.]

706
00:42:43,053 --> 00:42:46,561
- That's not the problem.
- There are too many questions.

707
00:42:46,562 --> 00:42:51,993
- How about we memorize one each?
- Let's divide the questions.

708
00:42:51,994 --> 00:42:54,018
[Just then, Big-nose proposes that
they memorize one question each.]

709
00:42:54,019 --> 00:42:56,428
Ha Ha can ask the questions,
and Ji Hyo can memorize the first question.

710
00:42:56,429 --> 00:42:59,059
- How about Lady Kim goes second?
- Lady Kim can go second.

711
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,578
- Okay.
- How about we go in this order?

712
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,087
[Their current seating is the order.]

713
00:43:03,088 --> 00:43:06,044
[Rehearsing how the quiz will go.]

714
00:43:06,045 --> 00:43:11,281
- The front and rear sensor...
- New SUV's anterior sensors.

715
00:43:11,775 --> 00:43:15,239
[Blank Ji's correct answer is the result
of the rehearsal they practiced earlier.]

716
00:43:17,705 --> 00:43:20,751
- What is your favorite tree?
- The ash tree?

717
00:43:23,297 --> 00:43:25,910
Why do you like the ash tree?

718
00:43:25,911 --> 00:43:27,524
Have you even seen that tree before?

719
00:43:27,525 --> 00:43:31,996
[Extremely unnatural answer to
a question- That ash tree?]

720
00:43:32,965 --> 00:43:35,801
It's your favorite tree!
The tree you most like.

721
00:43:35,802 --> 00:43:38,067
[Things are going along exactly
how they rehearsed it.]

722
00:43:40,513 --> 00:43:43,363
- You don't think Lady Kim will notice?
- We're definitely going to fail this.

723
00:43:43,364 --> 00:43:46,027
We have to do a good job
so that she doesn't catch on.

724
00:43:47,001 --> 00:43:50,107
[Will this candid camera mission succeed?]

725
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:56,114
[Their studying session continues
during their drive to the opening site.]

726
00:44:00,783 --> 00:44:02,962
I'm not going to study.

727
00:44:02,963 --> 00:44:05,133
I'm going to go with my gut feeling.

728
00:44:06,883 --> 00:44:08,863
[Even after having arrived
at the opening location.]

729
00:44:08,864 --> 00:44:13,971
[Member prepares for the mission by
writing cheat notes onto their skin.]

730
00:44:18,041 --> 00:44:21,973
[Even right up to the point of
the mission starting...]

731
00:44:21,974 --> 00:44:26,728
[They continue to study in secret.]

732
00:44:26,729 --> 00:44:33,557
[That's how they finished
preparing for their secret mission.]

733
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:42,696
[This is how the mission got underway.]

734
00:44:42,697 --> 00:44:46,842
- It's made with your favorite tree.
- A six person ash tree table?

735
00:44:46,843 --> 00:44:49,211
[Ash tree what?
First time ever hearing such a thing!]

736
00:44:49,212 --> 00:44:51,695
[These young people are
much smarter than I had thought.]

737
00:44:54,379 --> 00:44:56,897
I don't understand a single thing
that's being said.

738
00:44:56,898 --> 00:44:58,173
It's my favorite!

739
00:44:58,435 --> 00:45:00,786
[They don't know any of this either.]

740
00:45:01,184 --> 00:45:03,917
- Burgundy... red wine?
- That's right, burgundy?

741
00:45:04,507 --> 00:45:08,141
[I didn't know that Chun Hee
liked burgundy red wine.]

742
00:45:09,595 --> 00:45:11,443
[Extremely excited.]

743
00:45:12,479 --> 00:45:15,585
[Oh my goodness.]

744
00:45:17,357 --> 00:45:19,401
[Repeating the answer to himself
in case he forgets it.]

745
00:45:19,402 --> 00:45:23,271
- The really big...
- Halla Mountain!

746
00:45:23,272 --> 00:45:25,876
Halla mountain's aquifer that's
500m above sea level?

747
00:45:25,877 --> 00:45:28,325
That's right!

748
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:31,181
How am I supposed to know
something like that?

749
00:45:32,971 --> 00:45:35,347
[We've never heard it before
today either.]

750
00:45:35,348 --> 00:45:36,633
You can do this!

751
00:45:36,634 --> 00:45:39,845
You gave this to your wife
as a Christmas gift last year.

752
00:45:39,846 --> 00:45:41,511
[The thing Yoo Hyuk gave his wife
as a Christmas gift last year?]

753
00:45:41,512 --> 00:45:44,097
- It was a bracelet of some sort.
- Oh, that one!

754
00:45:44,098 --> 00:45:46,908
A 16 carat white diamond bracelet!

755
00:45:50,531 --> 00:45:51,969
Wow, you're a great husband.

756
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:55,877
You told your wife that you'd take her
camping this year, right?

757
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:58,948
- The thing that you use while camping...
- Portable pots and pans!

758
00:45:58,949 --> 00:46:02,197
But you know that thing...
it comes in a set!

759
00:46:02,232 --> 00:46:04,557
- Stainless...
- Hurry!

760
00:46:04,558 --> 00:46:09,633
[He hasn't... forgotten his answer,
has he?]

761
00:46:09,634 --> 00:46:14,695
- It comes in a set!
- Stainless portable pots and pan set!

762
00:46:14,696 --> 00:46:17,619
[Finally gets the correct answer.]

763
00:46:19,555 --> 00:46:23,300
Oh my goodness, I have no idea
what any of you are saying.

764
00:46:23,301 --> 00:46:26,471
- You know that mountain?
- Jiri mountain?

765
00:46:26,472 --> 00:46:30,360
Remember the thing I said would make
me really strong if I were to eat it?

766
00:46:30,361 --> 00:46:33,317
- Mountain ginseng?
- How old are the really effective ginseng?

767
00:46:33,803 --> 00:46:38,532
- 25 year old Jiri mountain ginseng?
- That's right!

768
00:46:41,156 --> 00:46:43,021
[What is going on here?]

769
00:46:45,854 --> 00:46:48,266
- Calm down.
- This is popular these days.

770
00:46:48,267 --> 00:46:50,910
[Already knows the answer before
the question is even asked.]

771
00:46:50,911 --> 00:46:55,949
- It's waterproof and really warm.
- Ultralight down jacket with padding?

772
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:57,917
- That's right!
- That was right?

773
00:47:01,548 --> 00:47:03,841
- It's Lady Kim's turn.
- We have faith in you!

774
00:47:03,842 --> 00:47:09,656
[It's finally her turn.
Correct answer, and they fail the mission.]

775
00:47:09,657 --> 00:47:14,747
<i>How about we ask the question in such a way
that she'd never get the correct answer?</i>

776
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:18,894
<i>If it looks like she knows the answer,
then we can start to confuse her.</i>

777
00:47:18,895 --> 00:47:20,887
[1. Purposely make the question confusing.
2. Divert her attention in moment of danger.]

778
00:47:22,935 --> 00:47:25,523
Front and the rear wheels
are shiny and bright.

779
00:47:25,524 --> 00:47:28,974
The kickboards are really shiny.
You all know this one, right?

780
00:47:28,975 --> 00:47:32,410
[Glow in the dark front and rear kickboard.]

781
00:47:32,411 --> 00:47:35,749
- You're asking it too hard!
- Ask the question simpler.

782
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:38,711
What's the name of the board
that shines and glows?

783
00:47:38,712 --> 00:47:41,533
What's the name of the board
that shines and glows?

784
00:47:41,785 --> 00:47:44,080
[Time over.]

785
00:47:44,081 --> 00:47:47,863
[Everyone starts to chastise Ha Ha as soon
as the game ends to avoid her catching on.]

786
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:52,104
I practically gave you the answer.
It's a glow in the dark kickboard.

787
00:47:52,105 --> 00:47:55,291
- Then you should've told me that.
- I basically did.

788
00:47:55,292 --> 00:47:58,186
- No, you didn't tell her.
- You need to apologize to her.

789
00:47:58,187 --> 00:48:00,604
No, it's okay.
It's because I didn't know.

790
00:48:00,605 --> 00:48:04,178
- He couldn't have explained it any better.
- Glow in the dark front and rear kickboard.

791
00:48:04,179 --> 00:48:05,959
[They did succeed the first round...]

792
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,644
The final question was way too hard.

793
00:48:08,645 --> 00:48:11,352
[Everyone seems to be nervous
that Lady Kim may catch on.]

794
00:48:11,353 --> 00:48:14,495
- No, it's okay.
- It's okay, you did great.

795
00:48:14,496 --> 00:48:17,667
- Okay, you get how it's done now?
- The question was hard.

796
00:48:17,668 --> 00:48:20,585
- The answer is within the question?
- Yes, that's right.

797
00:48:20,586 --> 00:48:24,055
[Thanks to Big Sister Kim
for always being so positive.]

798
00:48:25,323 --> 00:48:28,535
- This is a very simple game.
- We took too long with our answers.

799
00:48:28,536 --> 00:48:32,605
- How about we have Lady Kim go first?
- Okay.

800
00:48:32,606 --> 00:48:34,499
[For the next round,
Lady Kim is designated to go first.]

801
00:48:36,089 --> 00:48:37,575
Okay.

802
00:48:37,576 --> 00:48:40,011
<i>- Then let's move our spots around.
- Okay.</i>

803
00:48:40,012 --> 00:48:42,784
[Change of position was already
decided during the rehearsal.]

804
00:48:42,785 --> 00:48:46,496
<i>- How about we swap and have her go first?
- That's right.</i>

805
00:48:46,497 --> 00:48:48,757
<i>- That's right.
- Then we'll fail right away.</i>

806
00:48:48,758 --> 00:48:52,156
<i>Then we don't even have to
memorize this line!</i>

807
00:48:52,825 --> 00:48:55,326
[Yay, we don't have to study!]

808
00:48:56,024 --> 00:49:00,998
[This is the plan they came up with
to have Hye Ja go first.]

809
00:49:00,999 --> 00:49:03,612
- Okay.
- I'll explain it very slowly.

810
00:49:03,613 --> 00:49:05,177
[Chun Hee to ask the questions this time.]

811
00:49:07,321 --> 00:49:10,056
- We'll start with question number 21.
- Fighting.

812
00:49:10,057 --> 00:49:11,790
[Do a good job, Chun Hee.]

813
00:49:12,236 --> 00:49:14,113
Give me a minute.

814
00:49:14,114 --> 00:49:18,996
- Are you feeling nervous?
- My mouth feels parched.

815
00:49:19,463 --> 00:49:22,661
- You can take your time.
- Don't worry, we've got you.

816
00:49:22,662 --> 00:49:24,793
- Explain it to her slowly.
- Fighting!

817
00:49:24,794 --> 00:49:26,539
[Unstable Chun Hee-
Will he be able to do it right?]

818
00:49:27,939 --> 00:49:29,536
Set, go!

819
00:49:30,597 --> 00:49:32,917
Wow, this one is really hard.

820
00:49:32,918 --> 00:49:37,502
[Carcharodontosauridae figure.]

821
00:49:39,426 --> 00:49:41,575
[Unable to even talk.]

822
00:49:41,576 --> 00:49:43,739
- Hurry up!
- Say something.

823
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:45,319
You don't know it either?

824
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,901
[Even the team members can't figure out
whether he's acting, or if he's serious.]

825
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:49,937
- You have to say something.
- Hurry up and explain it.

826
00:49:49,938 --> 00:49:52,575
- Is it hard?
- It's a toy, Lady Kim.

827
00:49:52,576 --> 00:49:54,979
Leave out the 'Lady Kim.'

828
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:57,472
- Just talk.
- She's saying there's no time.

829
00:49:57,473 --> 00:49:59,433
- But...
- She's saying not to say 'Lady Kim.'

830
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:04,188
- It's a toy?
- It's an ancient dinosaur.

831
00:50:04,189 --> 00:50:07,105
- Just say something.
- There's something before the dinosaur.

832
00:50:07,106 --> 00:50:10,183
- This is...
- How about just the first word?

833
00:50:10,184 --> 00:50:13,785
- Be quiet.
- It's a six syllable word.

834
00:50:13,786 --> 00:50:16,009
It's a six syllable word?

835
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:17,891
A baby dinosaur?

836
00:50:17,892 --> 00:50:21,001
[This one?]

837
00:50:21,002 --> 00:50:24,215
It's blah blah blah,
and blah blah blah.

838
00:50:26,734 --> 00:50:28,793
- What is that?
- What's that supposed to be?

839
00:50:29,979 --> 00:50:32,804
[Just say something.]

840
00:50:32,805 --> 00:50:35,510
I've never heard of it before either.
I'll explain it one at a time.

841
00:50:36,315 --> 00:50:41,574
- First syllable is... 'car' in English is?
- Car.

842
00:50:41,575 --> 00:50:43,526
Yes, that's the first part.

843
00:50:44,306 --> 00:50:46,726
He's driving me crazy.

844
00:50:46,727 --> 00:50:48,650
[Already past the one minute mark.]

845
00:50:48,651 --> 00:50:52,412
- There's no time.
- We never should've had Chun Hee do it.

846
00:50:52,413 --> 00:50:55,044
[Hang in there a little bit longer,
Chun Hee!]

847
00:50:55,828 --> 00:50:59,810
There's a letter in the middle,
and there are double syllables.

848
00:50:59,811 --> 00:51:01,206
- Cane?
- Mone?

849
00:51:06,907 --> 00:51:08,244
What's he doing?

850
00:51:08,245 --> 00:51:10,416
[Even his own teammates
are embarrassed for him.]

851
00:51:10,417 --> 00:51:12,860
You can't even ask the question!

852
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:14,490
[If all this truly is just an act,
then it's some amazing acting.]

853
00:51:14,491 --> 00:51:16,878
- Ugh, he's so frustrating.
- Lee Chun Hee, do you want to die?

854
00:51:16,879 --> 00:51:19,765
[Not much time left on the clock.]

855
00:51:20,784 --> 00:51:24,322
- Car...
- Yes, and then...

856
00:51:24,323 --> 00:51:27,330
[Time's up!]

857
00:51:28,671 --> 00:51:31,052
- It's a really tough question!
- That was just absurd!

858
00:51:31,053 --> 00:51:35,016
- Carcharodontosauridae figurine.
- That is a tough question.

859
00:51:35,017 --> 00:51:37,728
- That's a real tough question.
- I don't even know what that's saying.

860
00:51:37,729 --> 00:51:39,726
What kind of a question was that?

861
00:51:39,727 --> 00:51:43,062
That was an unreasonable question
for them to have you ask.

862
00:51:43,063 --> 00:51:46,249
[It's normal for you
not to know the answer.]

863
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:48,753
- Who would even know this?
- That was disappointing.

864
00:51:48,754 --> 00:51:50,735
- That was just absurd.
- That was too tough of a question.

865
00:51:50,736 --> 00:51:54,736
- Let's just redo it.
- I think they want us to get it wrong.

866
00:51:56,836 --> 00:51:59,781
I think they want us to get it wrong.

867
00:51:59,782 --> 00:52:01,724
[Excuse me?]

868
00:52:01,725 --> 00:52:07,489
[She couldn't have... noticed it?]

869
00:52:08,956 --> 00:52:12,096
I think they're asking these questions
to make it funny, don't you think?

870
00:52:12,488 --> 00:52:15,229
So that you can't even explain
the question and it's funnier.

871
00:52:15,703 --> 00:52:19,115
So that you can't even explain
the question and it's funnier.

872
00:52:19,116 --> 00:52:25,720
- Okay, I get it now.
- Do you get it now?

873
00:52:25,755 --> 00:52:27,781
[Such a close call.]

874
00:52:29,341 --> 00:52:32,957
- I think she gets it now.
- Ugh, it's hot.

875
00:52:34,524 --> 00:52:38,291
[Happy Big Sister Kim keeps all the
members on the edge of their seats.]

876
00:52:38,292 --> 00:52:40,589
- Why don't you come over here?
- This is my new spot.

877
00:52:41,672 --> 00:52:44,161
Which order should we go in?

878
00:52:44,162 --> 00:52:49,246
- How about going down the eight line?
- From number 26 and down.

879
00:52:49,247 --> 00:52:51,760
- Then we just need to get seven questions.
- That's right.

880
00:52:51,761 --> 00:52:54,334
- We've already got two of the questions.
- Fighting!

881
00:52:54,335 --> 00:52:56,334
[After a loud cheer...]

882
00:52:57,334 --> 00:52:59,890
[Whew, that was a close call.]

883
00:52:59,891 --> 00:53:01,914
Ready, set, go!

884
00:53:02,588 --> 00:53:05,429
If there are six members in my family,
what kind of a rice cooker would I use?

885
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:09,154
Six person automatic...
Six person automatic rice pressure cooker!

886
00:53:09,155 --> 00:53:10,634
Bingo!

887
00:53:12,865 --> 00:53:15,542
The breed of dog I used to have
and it was at my wedding!

888
00:53:15,543 --> 00:53:17,318
- Bichon frise!
- Bingo!

889
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:19,681
[Hye Jung is really good.]

890
00:53:19,682 --> 00:53:22,948
The ingredient that's known to be
very good for your skin.

891
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:26,035
- Undiluted hyaluronic acid ample!
- Bingo!

892
00:53:26,894 --> 00:53:28,723
[What was that?]

893
00:53:29,253 --> 00:53:31,195
- It's not a manual.
- Automatic!

894
00:53:31,196 --> 00:53:33,627
- And it's bad...
- Kerosene!

895
00:53:33,628 --> 00:53:37,628
- And it gets rid of the moisture.
- A dehumidifier!

896
00:53:37,629 --> 00:53:40,181
- Put those two together!
- Automatic ionic sterilizing dehumidifier!

897
00:53:43,025 --> 00:53:45,118
- Oh my goodness.
- I've always wanted one of those.

898
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:46,518
[Shocking that Kwang Soo got it.]

899
00:53:46,519 --> 00:53:51,780
It's an anti-aging face cream
that really pulls things tighter.

900
00:53:51,781 --> 00:53:54,118
- Hybrid anti-aging cream?
- That's right!

901
00:53:56,727 --> 00:53:58,895
- How did you know that?
- I use it at home.

902
00:53:58,896 --> 00:54:01,036
- I always use it at home.
- You use it, too?

903
00:54:02,333 --> 00:54:04,971
- It's harmless...
- Non-toxic?

904
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,637
Yes, it's like a non-toxic glue stick.

905
00:54:07,638 --> 00:54:10,414
Wait, it's a non-toxic...

906
00:54:11,042 --> 00:54:17,080
[He couldn't have...
forgotten the answer?]

907
00:54:17,081 --> 00:54:21,385
[Non-toxic super glue stick.]

908
00:54:21,386 --> 00:54:23,623
Ugh, it's at the tip of my tongue!

909
00:54:24,948 --> 00:54:27,435
[Attempting to cheat
at a moment of danger.]

910
00:54:29,247 --> 00:54:31,332
[If he gets caught, then it's all over!]

911
00:54:34,444 --> 00:54:37,047
[But Ha Ha blocks her view with his back,
and fortunately avoids getting caught.]

912
00:54:37,048 --> 00:54:41,422
Is it a non-toxic super glue stick?

913
00:54:41,423 --> 00:54:43,211
- That's right!
- Yes!

914
00:54:43,212 --> 00:54:46,766
[Hye Jung gives a strong reaction to
avoid Hye Ja noticing anything amiss.]

915
00:54:51,206 --> 00:54:56,464
Lady Kim, this is a household appliance
that is similar to a refrigerator.

916
00:54:56,465 --> 00:54:59,184
[A freestanding air conditioner.]

917
00:54:59,756 --> 00:55:02,235
[We just need to last for 15 more seconds.]

918
00:55:02,236 --> 00:55:04,260
- It can be on the wall, too.
- Is it a wall decor?

919
00:55:04,261 --> 00:55:07,090
This is... um...

920
00:55:07,091 --> 00:55:10,063
[Hye Jung suddenly starts to stutter after
having done so well up to this point.]

921
00:55:10,064 --> 00:55:12,899
This is a freestanding thing.

922
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:15,639
- It's freestanding?
- Yes, it's freestanding.

923
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:18,187
- It's freestanding?
- A freestanding air conditioner?

924
00:55:18,188 --> 00:55:20,227
A freestanding air conditioner?

925
00:55:20,228 --> 00:55:22,565
[Even with the confusing explanation,
she still gets close to the exact answer!]

926
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:28,507
[They even practiced this question!]

927
00:55:28,508 --> 00:55:33,491
<i>- I have one at my house, too, and it's...
- Time's up!</i>

928
00:55:34,413 --> 00:55:37,186
<i>I think you're going to have to practice
how to make the question more difficult.</i>

929
00:55:37,187 --> 00:55:39,331
<i>Since there's a time limit,
how about we take longer at the start?</i>

930
00:55:39,332 --> 00:55:44,169
<i>- So that she doesn't have much time.
- Stall more in the beginning?</i>

931
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:46,516
<i>But making this difficult
is going to be the hard part.</i>

932
00:55:48,764 --> 00:55:52,833
[Even with all the confusion,
she almost gets the exact answer!]

933
00:55:57,478 --> 00:55:59,942
[Ugh, we're ruined!]

934
00:55:59,943 --> 00:56:01,924
[Candid camera quiz is in danger!]

935
00:56:01,925 --> 00:56:04,016
- A freestanding air conditioner?
- It's not just your regular air conditioner.

936
00:56:04,017 --> 00:56:06,548
It's a little...

937
00:56:07,984 --> 00:56:11,506
[Time fortunately runs out
in the midst of extreme danger.]

938
00:56:11,507 --> 00:56:15,353
[A little better explanation, then she
would've gotten the exact answer!]

939
00:56:15,354 --> 00:56:18,205
- A heating and cooling.
- Wow, that was so close!

940
00:56:18,206 --> 00:56:21,920
- It's a heating and cooling system.
- Can't this one count?

941
00:56:21,921 --> 00:56:24,681
- She was so close to the answer!
- This one should count.

942
00:56:25,069 --> 00:56:27,983
It's because I don't like being hot.

943
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:30,928
[Big Sister Kim doesn't like things
to make her feel hot.]

944
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,427
She doesn't like to feel hot,
so why would you ask this question?

945
00:56:33,428 --> 00:56:36,393
- She had the answer.
- That's basically getting the question right.

946
00:56:36,394 --> 00:56:39,467
- I really don't like being hot.
- You seem to like air conditioners.

947
00:56:39,468 --> 00:56:43,234
- I don't like being hot.
- I really don't like heaters either.

948
00:56:43,235 --> 00:56:45,737
She got that right away.

949
00:56:45,738 --> 00:56:48,662
[Such a smart mother.
Almost failed their candid camera mission.]

950
00:56:48,663 --> 00:56:50,901
- We're almost there!
- We've almost got it.

951
00:56:51,602 --> 00:56:53,643
[Success of our mission is almost here.]

952
00:56:54,127 --> 00:56:56,261
- We're almost there.
- We've got this.

953
00:56:56,262 --> 00:56:58,699
- Should I go?
- What's almost there?

954
00:57:00,883 --> 00:57:03,209
[Everyone freezes in their spots.]

955
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:05,708
What's almost there?

956
00:57:05,709 --> 00:57:08,517
[Everyone freezes at her question.]

957
00:57:08,518 --> 00:57:13,968
- Just that we almost have a bingo line.
- One more round, and we may have it.

958
00:57:14,450 --> 00:57:17,259
- We're almost there to getting it right.
- We may get it at the next round.

959
00:57:18,065 --> 00:57:20,652
- This is our last chance.
- This is the last round?

960
00:57:20,653 --> 00:57:22,645
Let's get it done this time.

961
00:57:22,646 --> 00:57:24,984
[Will they be able to successfully complete
the candid camera mission?]

962
00:57:24,985 --> 00:57:31,724
[Guys, one more mistake,
and it's all over for us!]

963
00:57:31,725 --> 00:57:34,462
- Who's good at explaining things?
- Who wants to ask this time?

964
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:35,544
[It's your turn.]

965
00:57:35,545 --> 00:57:37,622
- Why doesn't Kwang Soo do it?
- Kwang Soo, you give it a try.

966
00:57:37,623 --> 00:57:40,130
[The unlucky guy's turn?]

967
00:57:40,974 --> 00:57:44,007
[Kwang Soo is tagged in.
Will their gamble succeed?]

968
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:48,358
[From question number 23 and down.]

969
00:57:48,914 --> 00:57:52,196
- Wow, these are easy questions.
- Good, this is our chance.

970
00:57:52,197 --> 00:57:55,136
- This is our chance, Lady Kim.
- Ready, set, go!

971
00:57:55,137 --> 00:57:56,158
[Candid camera bingo quiz-
Final round.]

972
00:57:56,159 --> 00:57:59,379
It's a bracelet...

973
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:00,914
[A bracelet?]

974
00:58:01,391 --> 00:58:03,192
It's a bracelet.

975
00:58:03,193 --> 00:58:04,965
[He's supposed to ask the
23rd question.]

976
00:58:04,966 --> 00:58:10,904
[But he's asking question number five
that's already been asked earlier.]

977
00:58:11,746 --> 00:58:13,506
[That's the question I answered earlier.]

978
00:58:14,132 --> 00:58:17,194
The thing I found by eating baby food?

979
00:58:17,195 --> 00:58:20,118
The thing I found by eating baby food?

980
00:58:20,119 --> 00:58:22,642
[Ready to go baby food pouches.]

981
00:58:23,409 --> 00:58:26,873
- Kwang Soo...
- Isn't it baby food?

982
00:58:26,874 --> 00:58:29,894
- Kwang Soo, you've got the wrong question.
- You have to start with question 23.

983
00:58:29,895 --> 00:58:32,668
[Bad luck guy gets abused on.]

984
00:58:32,669 --> 00:58:37,606
The baby food that my baby likes.

985
00:58:37,967 --> 00:58:40,782
Jae Suk already got the 16 carat
diamond bracelet question.

986
00:58:41,054 --> 00:58:44,844
[Ugh, he's so frustrating.]

987
00:58:46,086 --> 00:58:48,859
My baby food.
The baby food that I like.

988
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:51,103
- What is he doing?
- What is it?

989
00:58:51,138 --> 00:58:53,226
It's a really expensive baby food!

990
00:58:53,227 --> 00:58:57,431
- I think I know!
- I'm going to feed this to my future baby.

991
00:58:57,432 --> 00:59:01,312
- I'm going to feed this to my future baby.
- Ready to go baby food pouches!

992
00:59:01,313 --> 00:59:03,810
Okay, that's the correct answer!

993
00:59:03,811 --> 00:59:06,522
- What are you doing?
- You're not asking the right questions!

994
00:59:06,523 --> 00:59:08,434
Just ask the next question.

995
00:59:08,534 --> 00:59:11,307
[At this rate, time is going to run out
before it gets to Hye Ja's turn.]

996
00:59:11,308 --> 00:59:14,411
During the Joseon era...

997
00:59:14,412 --> 00:59:15,865
[Joseon era?]

998
00:59:15,866 --> 00:59:20,319
- It's a keychain bed.
- What is he doing?

999
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,434
What is he doing?

1000
00:59:22,435 --> 00:59:26,268
[Buckle field cot.]

1001
00:59:26,269 --> 00:59:28,920
It's a bed from the Joseon era.

1002
00:59:29,593 --> 00:59:32,792
Are you talking about a buckle?

1003
00:59:32,793 --> 00:59:35,607
[A brand new quiz style where the answer
has to be tailored to the question.]

1004
00:59:35,608 --> 00:59:37,555
- Buckle field cot?
- Okay, that's the correct answer.

1005
00:59:38,327 --> 00:59:40,328
[What was that?]

1006
00:59:41,085 --> 00:59:43,763
- Hurry up!
- A car that spouts water.

1007
00:59:43,764 --> 00:59:45,993
Water that spouts from the car.

1008
00:59:45,994 --> 00:59:48,839
[Direct injection turbo engine
convertible.]

1009
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,093
The engine spouts out water, too.

1010
00:59:51,094 --> 00:59:54,659
- It spouts out water?
- Yes, from the top and from the engine.

1011
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,715
It spouts water when you spin it.

1012
00:59:56,716 --> 00:59:58,637
[It sounds like a transformer car.]

1013
00:59:59,463 --> 01:00:02,085
- Turbo engine convertible.
- Okay!

1014
01:00:04,345 --> 01:00:06,461
- How did you know that?
- What was that?

1015
01:00:06,462 --> 01:00:09,413
- A car that spouts water?
- You have to explain it better!

1016
01:00:09,414 --> 01:00:10,753
[Even Chun Hee starts to yell
at Kwang Soo.]

1017
01:00:11,223 --> 01:00:12,813
[Get yourself together!]

1018
01:00:12,814 --> 01:00:14,579
What is he doing?

1019
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:16,943
[Something's very weird...]

1020
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:20,326
- It's a sort of a car.
- Has he lost his mind?

1021
01:00:20,327 --> 01:00:22,367
[We're the idiots for
having trusted Kwang Soo.]

1022
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:25,575
- What is he talking about?
- Good for the body and purification.

1023
01:00:25,576 --> 01:00:26,994
[He should be able to get a gauge
for what the answer is by now.]

1024
01:00:26,995 --> 01:00:29,933
- It's in the coffee, but not here.
- Caffeine?

1025
01:00:30,557 --> 01:00:31,924
Tea.

1026
01:00:31,925 --> 01:00:35,222
Eco-friendly and caffeine free
five variety tea set?

1027
01:00:35,223 --> 01:00:36,533
[But he still answers it correctly.]

1028
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:40,953
[From Hye Ja's point of view,
Gary is a true genius.]

1029
01:00:44,624 --> 01:00:46,381
- I know what this one is!
- What is it?

1030
01:00:46,382 --> 01:00:49,165
It's the thing I gave you as
a Christmas gift last year!

1031
01:00:49,844 --> 01:00:53,227
- Timing humidifier?
- No, it's not 'timing.'

1032
01:00:53,228 --> 01:00:55,272
No, it's not 'timing.'

1033
01:00:57,624 --> 01:00:59,904
[It's not?]

1034
01:01:02,532 --> 01:01:05,023
[Reaches for his cheat sheet
in the sleeve.]

1035
01:01:05,752 --> 01:01:08,381
[Big-nose forgot the answer.]

1036
01:01:08,382 --> 01:01:12,258
- What are you guys doing!
- You got the humidifier part.

1037
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,437
- Humidifier with automatic timer.
- Okay!

1038
01:01:18,312 --> 01:01:21,757
[Barely manages to escape the danger.]

1039
01:01:21,758 --> 01:01:25,148
What is this monitor called?

1040
01:01:25,149 --> 01:01:27,115
What do you call this monitor?

1041
01:01:27,116 --> 01:01:28,560
What do you call this monitor?

1042
01:01:28,561 --> 01:01:31,454
[Time fortunately runs out.]

1043
01:01:31,455 --> 01:01:33,987
[Barely manages to succeed
the candid camera mission.]

1044
01:01:33,988 --> 01:01:37,222
[Almost failed the mission no thanks
to Big-nosed Brother.]

1045
01:01:37,830 --> 01:01:40,209
- How could you have forgotten the timer?
- Timing and timer...

1046
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:44,238
- I gave you one as a gift last year.
- What are you guys doing?

1047
01:01:44,962 --> 01:01:47,857
This isn't your fault, Lady Kim.
They wasted so much time.

1048
01:01:47,858 --> 01:01:50,634
- You did really well.
- But I didn't even do anything.

1049
01:01:51,388 --> 01:01:53,926
[I'm sorry, Lady Kim.]

1050
01:01:54,507 --> 01:01:57,459
As a team, you succeeded your mission.

1051
01:01:57,460 --> 01:02:01,298
[Kim Hye Ja's candid camera mission
is a success!]

1052
01:02:02,582 --> 01:02:05,236
[What did we succeed?]

1053
01:02:08,285 --> 01:02:12,934
- The truth is...
- We'll tell you down on our knees.

1054
01:02:12,935 --> 01:02:14,825
[Everyone gets down on their knees.]

1055
01:02:14,826 --> 01:02:17,297
[Me, too?]

1056
01:02:17,298 --> 01:02:19,296
[Our mother is so innocent
right to the very end.]

1057
01:02:19,297 --> 01:02:24,238
We all met about two hours before the day,
and we memorized all these answers.

1058
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:27,101
We've already known all the answers.

1059
01:02:27,102 --> 01:02:29,021
Then why did you get it wrong?

1060
01:02:29,022 --> 01:02:31,717
- You were supposed to get it wrong.
- Here, have a seat.

1061
01:02:31,718 --> 01:02:33,824
- Have a seat here.
- Sit down here.

1062
01:02:33,825 --> 01:02:36,456
[It's time to fess up.]

1063
01:02:36,457 --> 01:02:39,091
- We already knew all the answers.
- We've studied the questions.

1064
01:02:39,759 --> 01:02:43,130
- That was our mission.
- Didn't you think we got the answers easily?

1065
01:02:43,131 --> 01:02:46,348
- Those were some hard questions.
- I thought you were all just very smart.

1066
01:02:46,951 --> 01:02:48,854
[We wish that was the case.]

1067
01:02:48,855 --> 01:02:52,903
- That was what we studied.
- We wrote cheat notes on our hands.

1068
01:02:52,904 --> 01:02:55,300
- They're all written on our hands.
- Oh my!

1069
01:02:55,301 --> 01:02:58,153
Oh my, it was a candid camera.

1070
01:02:58,154 --> 01:03:02,015
Our mission was to make sure
that you got all the answers wrong.

1071
01:03:02,016 --> 01:03:03,934
Then you succeeded.

1072
01:03:05,484 --> 01:03:07,372
We all succeeded together!

1073
01:03:07,373 --> 01:03:09,150
[Mother laughs it all off.]

1074
01:03:09,151 --> 01:03:12,732
But instead of getting frustrated,
you look so happy about it.

1075
01:03:12,733 --> 01:03:16,081
We only succeeded our mission
because it was your candid camera.

1076
01:03:16,082 --> 01:03:18,803
- You don't mind?
- It's fun!

1077
01:03:19,448 --> 01:03:23,085
[What a generous lady.]

1078
01:03:23,086 --> 01:03:24,741
- I had no idea.
- You didn't know?

1079
01:03:24,742 --> 01:03:27,893
- You didn't think it was weird?
- I didn't think it was weird at all.

1080
01:03:27,894 --> 01:03:30,147
I was just amazed at how good
everyone was.

1081
01:03:30,148 --> 01:03:33,517
But you almost got the
air conditioner question right.

1082
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:35,287
Had you answered the correctly,
we would've failed the mission.

1083
01:03:35,288 --> 01:03:38,342
Really?
That would've been bad!

1084
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:42,153
[Members are feeling worse because she's
truly happy they succeeded their mission.]

1085
01:03:42,154 --> 01:03:44,762
- You're making us feel even worse.
- She really is an angel.

1086
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:48,943
I can't get upset over something like that.

1087
01:03:48,944 --> 01:03:50,596
[Angel Hye Ja.]

1088
01:03:50,597 --> 01:03:53,437
- This isn't something to be upset over.
- I made it more difficult on purpose.

1089
01:03:54,187 --> 01:03:55,929
[But...]

1090
01:03:55,930 --> 01:03:59,178
But I'm never going to let
you fool me again.

1091
01:03:59,613 --> 01:04:02,705
[So positive right up to the end.]

1092
01:04:03,057 --> 01:04:05,044
This is really fun.

1093
01:04:06,085 --> 01:04:09,805
Since you've succeeded your mission,
you can draw from one through nine.

1094
01:04:09,806 --> 01:04:12,126
[After wrapping up the candid mission,
it's time for another drawing.]

1095
01:04:12,573 --> 01:04:15,615
[Santa's lottery race-
All the numbers are added into the pool.]

1096
01:04:15,616 --> 01:04:17,987
[Oldest Running Man member,
Big-nose does the drawing.]

1097
01:04:21,227 --> 01:04:22,708
Pull it.

1098
01:04:24,971 --> 01:04:26,970
[Number one is chosen.]

1099
01:04:32,515 --> 01:04:35,425
- How could that even happen?
- Guys, the next number is most important.

1100
01:04:35,426 --> 01:04:37,646
Your face is beet red right now.

1101
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:40,468
[Big-nose doesn't even know
what to say.]

1102
01:04:40,832 --> 01:04:43,284
Life can be that way.

1103
01:04:43,736 --> 01:04:47,444
[You can't always get what
you want in life.]

1104
01:04:47,445 --> 01:04:50,272
- That's what he's like.
- He just threw away 800,000 Won.

1105
01:04:50,924 --> 01:04:54,269
[It could've been 980,000 Won.]

1106
01:04:54,270 --> 01:04:57,140
We still have a chance.

1107
01:04:57,642 --> 01:05:00,179
- It's okay.
- Thank you.

1108
01:05:01,936 --> 01:05:03,997
I'll keep in touch from now on.

1109
01:05:04,486 --> 01:05:08,862
- Don't think about bothering her.
- Call your own parents once in a while.

1110
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:12,217
- Call your own parents.
- I'll check in on you once in a while.

1111
01:05:12,218 --> 01:05:15,316
[Don't forget to call your own parents
once in a while.]

1112
01:05:18,875 --> 01:05:22,688
[Christmas is the time for
loving and caring for others.]

1113
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:32,059
[Nine giant sized bells!]

1114
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:33,964
It must be real flour.

1115
01:05:34,576 --> 01:05:37,583
- It must be real flour.
- What is it this time?

1116
01:05:37,584 --> 01:05:41,518
It's time for the final mission of the race.

1117
01:05:41,519 --> 01:05:44,912
Your final mission is,
'Yes, this is the sentence.'

1118
01:05:44,913 --> 01:05:47,177
I have a bad feeling about this.

1119
01:05:47,178 --> 01:05:49,977
Lady Kim, please step forward.

1120
01:05:49,978 --> 01:05:51,542
What do I have to do?

1121
01:05:51,543 --> 01:05:58,394
The rest of the members can take a spot
underneath the bells behind you.

1122
01:05:58,786 --> 01:06:01,120
Your final mission is very simple.

1123
01:06:01,121 --> 01:06:04,740
Lady Kim will determine the members' fates.

1124
01:06:05,192 --> 01:06:08,757
Can you please tell me what kind
of a cellphone you have?

1125
01:06:08,758 --> 01:06:12,611
- What type of a cellphone do you use?
- I use a smartphone.

1126
01:06:12,612 --> 01:06:14,846
- You use a smartphone?
- That's great.

1127
01:06:14,847 --> 01:06:16,694
- Why?
- Here's your mission.

1128
01:06:16,695 --> 01:06:26,208
Lady Kim must send a text message exactly
as what she is told within 30 seconds.

1129
01:06:26,575 --> 01:06:31,581
If she sends it accurately within that time,
then you avoid receiving the flour penalty.

1130
01:06:31,954 --> 01:06:34,376
But if she goes over the time limit

1131
01:06:34,377 --> 01:06:38,458
or if she gets the text inaccurately,
then you'll receive the flour penalty.

1132
01:06:38,459 --> 01:06:40,180
The thing you must remember is

1133
01:06:40,181 --> 01:06:45,285
you must utilize the exact spacing and
emoticons as you're instructed to.

1134
01:06:45,286 --> 01:06:49,892
If she gets it right on the first try,
then everyone will pass successfully.

1135
01:06:50,290 --> 01:06:55,734
Lady Kim's text will be shown on the screen
behind you as she writes.

1136
01:06:55,735 --> 01:06:59,023
[Lady Kim's text will be shown on the screen
behind them in real time.]

1137
01:06:59,024 --> 01:07:02,138
- Take your time, and you should be fine.
- You text often, do you not?

1138
01:07:02,139 --> 01:07:04,044
I'm very good at texting.

1139
01:07:05,364 --> 01:07:07,034
- We're all set!
- This is good.

1140
01:07:07,035 --> 01:07:08,499
[We'll be fine!]

1141
01:07:09,794 --> 01:07:11,757
This is really great.

1142
01:07:11,758 --> 01:07:14,744
[We have our faith in you!]

1143
01:07:18,432 --> 01:07:22,860
As mentioned before, she will be given
30 seconds per text message.

1144
01:07:22,861 --> 01:07:25,098
[Will she be able to accurately
text within those 30 seconds?]

1145
01:07:25,099 --> 01:07:28,713
- I have to get all the punctuations, too?
- Yes.

1146
01:07:28,714 --> 01:07:32,476
Comma, spacing, and everything else
has to be exactly the same.

1147
01:07:33,027 --> 01:07:35,913
I normally don't use things like that.

1148
01:07:35,914 --> 01:07:38,776
She's saying that she doesn't
like the use of emoticons.

1149
01:07:38,777 --> 01:07:42,252
Who out there uses all those
punctuations?

1150
01:07:42,253 --> 01:07:43,692
[But the rules of the game
must be followed.]

1151
01:07:43,693 --> 01:07:46,840
- You can just relax and take it easy.
- Please do not worry about us.

1152
01:07:46,841 --> 01:07:50,243
The final numerical drawing all
depends on the outcome of this mission.

1153
01:07:50,495 --> 01:07:52,605
- Lady Kim, fighting!
- Fighting!

1154
01:07:52,606 --> 01:07:54,416
Fighting!

1155
01:07:54,417 --> 01:07:56,355
Here's your first text message.

1156
01:07:56,356 --> 01:07:58,783
[Rudolph the reindeer's red nose
is a very shiny nose.]

1157
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:02,963
[Spacing is very crucial!]

1158
01:08:03,558 --> 01:08:07,036
- Wow, she's fast.
- She's really good at it.

1159
01:08:07,037 --> 01:08:09,156
Is there a space between that?

1160
01:08:09,157 --> 01:08:11,426
There needs to be a space between
'Rudolph' and 'Reindeer.'

1161
01:08:11,427 --> 01:08:13,554
Lady Kim, there needs to be a space.

1162
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:20,882
- I think she's going to get it.
- You left the period in there.

1163
01:08:23,699 --> 01:08:26,029
- You left the period.
- Hang on.

1164
01:08:26,030 --> 01:08:28,298
Why are there so many things?

1165
01:08:28,299 --> 01:08:30,875
You have to include the
smiley eyes in there.

1166
01:08:30,876 --> 01:08:33,639
Just be quiet!

1167
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:36,537
Just be quiet!

1168
01:08:37,855 --> 01:08:40,227
- There she goes.
- She's very good at it.

1169
01:08:45,049 --> 01:08:48,557
[Round one is over in failure.]

1170
01:08:48,558 --> 01:08:50,576
Wow, 30 seconds goes by quick.

1171
01:08:50,577 --> 01:08:54,847
- She said she was good at it.
- I did do a good job.

1172
01:08:56,434 --> 01:08:59,940
I'd rather be under those bells.
I feel so awful about this.

1173
01:08:59,941 --> 01:09:02,013
It's okay, we're already covered in flour.

1174
01:09:02,014 --> 01:09:04,918
- Okay, I'll just do as I please.
- We don't mind being dumped on again.

1175
01:09:04,919 --> 01:09:07,335
We just need to succeed because
we need to draw for that money.

1176
01:09:07,336 --> 01:09:10,320
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

1177
01:09:10,667 --> 01:09:17,028
- It's okay!
- It's okay!

1178
01:09:17,029 --> 01:09:20,432
Maybe this is so that we can
experience a white Christmas.

1179
01:09:20,433 --> 01:09:24,337
[A special Christmas with the fall
of white flour snow.]

1180
01:09:25,763 --> 01:09:27,998
- It's okay.
- We're fine.

1181
01:09:27,999 --> 01:09:29,824
[Thank you for making me feel better.]

1182
01:09:29,825 --> 01:09:32,179
- We won't say anything anymore.
- Please take your time.

1183
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:34,432
We're already covered in flour,
so don't worry about it.

1184
01:09:34,433 --> 01:09:36,653
- Don't worry.
- Okay.

1185
01:09:37,830 --> 01:09:42,477
- No need to be that relaxed about it though.
- Maybe stay a little bit nervous.

1186
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:46,170
- Please don't forget the spacing.
- Don't feel pressured.

1187
01:09:46,617 --> 01:09:49,324
Maybe it'll be easier to do all that
after I finish writing it out first.

1188
01:09:49,325 --> 01:09:52,044
- Yes, you can do that afterward.
- No, that's even harder.

1189
01:09:52,045 --> 01:09:54,654
- That'll just make it harder.
- Just go in the order.

1190
01:09:54,655 --> 01:09:56,767
- Just do as you'd like.
- Okay.

1191
01:09:56,768 --> 01:09:59,512
- Do as you please.
- Here's your second text.

1192
01:09:59,513 --> 01:10:02,278
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

1193
01:10:02,279 --> 01:10:06,190
- We're just getting started.
- Here's your text message.

1194
01:10:06,191 --> 01:10:07,340
[Round two.]

1195
01:10:07,341 --> 01:10:09,923
- I think this one is easier.
- Fighting!

1196
01:10:09,924 --> 01:10:11,328
[This may be easier!]

1197
01:10:11,329 --> 01:10:13,178
This one is easy.

1198
01:10:13,179 --> 01:10:17,108
[The perfect way to spend Christmas.]

1199
01:10:17,109 --> 01:10:20,771
- She's doing very well.
- We're going to get this one.

1200
01:10:20,772 --> 01:10:22,464
- She's got it!
- There's a space!

1201
01:10:23,626 --> 01:10:27,452
[Perfect use of spacing.]

1202
01:10:27,453 --> 01:10:28,991
She's got it.

1203
01:10:28,992 --> 01:10:34,056
- The space...
- Okay, but I need more time.

1204
01:10:35,443 --> 01:10:38,576
- The perfect way!
- You're almost there!

1205
01:10:38,577 --> 01:10:41,026
- There you go!
- Space and 'Way!'

1206
01:10:41,027 --> 01:10:44,539
[Now... all she has to write is, 'Way.']

1207
01:10:47,045 --> 01:10:50,226
[Please...]

1208
01:10:54,203 --> 01:10:55,752
I got it.

1209
01:10:57,507 --> 01:11:00,072
[Text message complete.]

1210
01:11:02,894 --> 01:11:05,775
[Final mission, 'This is the sentence'-
Successfully completed!]

1211
01:11:06,692 --> 01:11:08,362
[She did it!]

1212
01:11:11,693 --> 01:11:14,891
[Kim Hye Ja doesn't fail twice!]

1213
01:11:16,363 --> 01:11:18,264
You did such a great job.

1214
01:11:18,877 --> 01:11:22,467
[Mission success!
Yes, this is it.]

1215
01:11:22,468 --> 01:11:24,310
You did such a great job.

1216
01:11:24,311 --> 01:11:27,045
- Thank you, and I'm so sorry.
- No, not at all.

1217
01:11:27,046 --> 01:11:28,945
[Lady Kim, high-five!]

1218
01:11:28,946 --> 01:11:30,738
[Big-nose cuts in.]

1219
01:11:30,739 --> 01:11:31,764
[Left hanging.]

1220
01:11:31,765 --> 01:11:33,767
- Sorry.
- No, not at all.

1221
01:11:34,742 --> 01:11:36,935
You did such a great job.

1222
01:11:36,936 --> 01:11:40,654
[Kiddo Ha Ha wants to be
embraced by mommy Hye Ja.]

1223
01:11:40,655 --> 01:11:42,864
Can you come back on the
show every week?

1224
01:11:42,865 --> 01:11:45,586
Okay, then make me a
permanent member.

1225
01:11:45,587 --> 01:11:50,286
- Yes, wouldn't that be great?
- Congratulations on passing the mission.

1226
01:11:50,287 --> 01:11:52,292
[Succeeded the final mission
thanks to Big Sister Kim.]

1227
01:11:53,416 --> 01:11:55,955
There's a good chance that
we'll get a nine.

1228
01:11:55,956 --> 01:11:59,652
[Balls numbered from one and nine,
and everyone chants for a nine.]

1229
01:11:59,653 --> 01:12:02,177
We're all going to start screaming
if we do get a nine.

1230
01:12:02,178 --> 01:12:04,016
[Best case scenario would be
to get a nine.]

1231
01:12:04,017 --> 01:12:08,632
No thanks to Ji Suk Jin,
we only have 180,000 Won right now.

1232
01:12:08,633 --> 01:12:12,646
But I really want all of us
to come out winners.

1233
01:12:12,647 --> 01:12:16,961
Since there's a zero in there,
if you get it, you only get 180,000 Won.

1234
01:12:16,962 --> 01:12:18,830
Ready, it's the last ball!

1235
01:12:19,269 --> 01:12:22,299
[The final drawing which
Big Sister Kim will gets to draw.]

1236
01:12:23,549 --> 01:12:27,255
[Please... let it be a nine.]

1237
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:31,213
- Anything above a five.
- Don't let it pressure you.

1238
01:12:31,214 --> 01:12:34,557
[Let's draw the ball!]

1239
01:12:35,283 --> 01:12:41,219
[Which numbered ball will it be?]

1240
01:12:42,639 --> 01:12:44,763
[Please let it be a nine!]

1241
01:12:44,764 --> 01:12:47,225
- Did you get the ball?
- Is it out yet?

1242
01:12:51,876 --> 01:12:54,091
- Why?
- What is it?

1243
01:12:55,413 --> 01:12:59,487
[Did you see the number?]

1244
01:12:59,488 --> 01:13:01,121
What is it?
What's the number?

1245
01:13:01,122 --> 01:13:03,589
- What's the number?
- What is it?

1246
01:13:03,590 --> 01:13:07,657
[Could that smile...
mean that it's a zero?]

1247
01:13:07,658 --> 01:13:10,950
- Okay... what if it's a nine?
- Is it a zero?

1248
01:13:10,951 --> 01:13:12,825
[Could it be a nine?]

1249
01:13:12,826 --> 01:13:14,641
- What is it?
- What is that smile for?

1250
01:13:14,642 --> 01:13:20,480
[What is the number?]

1251
01:13:21,159 --> 01:13:22,965
Six!

1252
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:29,081
[The final number is a six!]

1253
01:13:29,082 --> 01:13:34,721
- That's 6.18 million Won.
- 6.18 million Won!

1254
01:13:34,722 --> 01:13:39,441
[Santa's lottery drawing-
Wins 6.18 million Won!]

1255
01:13:41,762 --> 01:13:45,453
- Wow, that's a lot of money.
- Are you really giving that money to us?

1256
01:13:46,193 --> 01:13:48,647
[Here's the cash.]

1257
01:13:48,648 --> 01:13:50,247
Really?

1258
01:13:50,656 --> 01:13:52,940
- Wow.
- This is for real.

1259
01:13:53,523 --> 01:13:55,677
- Should we take a look?
- Why don't you open one up?

1260
01:13:56,613 --> 01:13:59,246
- Wow, it's real.
- It's real money.

1261
01:13:59,247 --> 01:14:01,863
- Oh my, it's real.
- It's real money.

1262
01:14:01,864 --> 01:14:08,158
- Oh my, thank you.
- 6.18 million Won!

1263
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:09,778
[A truly shocking Christmas gift.]

1264
01:14:11,328 --> 01:14:16,522
In the name of Lady Kim Hye Ja
and our other guests

1265
01:14:16,523 --> 01:14:19,272
we will donate this money
to children in need!

1266
01:14:19,273 --> 01:14:21,334
[All of 6.18 million Won will be
donated to children in need.]

1267
01:14:22,074 --> 01:14:25,654
I hope you'll join us for a name tag
elimination game if you ever come back.

1268
01:14:26,372 --> 01:14:29,437
- I really had a wonderful time.
- Really?

1269
01:14:29,438 --> 01:14:34,813
I met such a wonderful group of people,
and I was so happy to be here.

1270
01:14:34,814 --> 01:14:39,352
It was a joyous and wonderful time,
and thank you so much for having me.

1271
01:14:39,353 --> 01:14:42,091
- Thank you, it was our honor.
- It truly was our honor.

1272
01:14:42,092 --> 01:14:46,652
Can you please say something for us?
Something that we've all wanted to hear.

1273
01:14:46,653 --> 01:14:50,017
- The saying, 'Yes, that's it.'
- Ah, that saying?

1274
01:14:50,503 --> 01:14:54,150
- As she rips off a name tag?
- Why don't you rip mine off as you say it?

1275
01:14:54,151 --> 01:14:56,601
[While ripping off Mr. Capable's name tag.]

1276
01:14:56,602 --> 01:14:59,488
- Okay.
- I can't believe this is happening!

1277
01:15:00,165 --> 01:15:03,705
- I feel nervous.
- But my mom's cooking isn't it.

1278
01:15:04,807 --> 01:15:07,445
- Here I go.
- Okay.

1279
01:15:09,971 --> 01:15:12,316
Yes, that's it.

1280
01:15:12,317 --> 01:15:13,900
['Yes, that's it.']

1281
01:15:14,868 --> 01:15:18,057
[Thank you to Kim Hye Ja, Lee Chun Hee, and
