a select summering spot,

19
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,860
until all the daytrippers
and the riffraff moved in.

20
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,540
Didn't you say Dot was off
for a week in Queenscliff?

21
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,380
Uh, with Miss Fisher, sir, yes.

22
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,980
I wish criminals
would take a holiday, sir.

23
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,380
That way we could get a bit of peace
and quiet too.

24
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,860
You should know by now, Collins,

25
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,340
no-one has a quiet time
around Miss Fisher.

26
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,420
What's this?
A small fortune, Collins.

27
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,620
They've found Bonito's
lost treasure, again.

28
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,140
Hmm. You collect coins,
don't you, sir?

29
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,700
You ever seen anything
like this one?

30
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,300
Hard to tell from the photograph,
Collins.

31
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,540
But if I'd collected
a genuine Spanish doubloon,

32
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,340
I wouldn't be sitting
behind this desk.

(Honking)

34
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,180
Sorry, but Mrs McNaster is not home
for company at the moment.

35
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,020
Ah, what nonsense!
We're expected.

36
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,820
And we're not company,
we're old friends.

37
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,820
Perhaps you could ask Mrs McNaster
when she will be home.

38
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,740
Rightio.

39
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,820
Come back here
and fetch the baggage.

40
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,260
What are you doing,
greeting visitors anyway?

41
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,900

00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,020
Oh, Prudence, I'm so sorry!

44
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,100
I tried to telephone you,
but you'd already left.

45
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,860
My dear Hilly,
I thought we were expected.

46
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,140
What on earth's the matter?

47
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,780
Well, I have no staff,
my house is in an uproar.

48
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,260
Mr and Mrs Johnson have taken

49
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,700
a sudden
and most inconvenient retirement.

50
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,420
Retirement?
And they've left me, yes!

51
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,820
We could telephone Mr Butler
and have him come down by train.

52
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,020
And I'm very happy
to make myself useful.

53
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,260
The burglary, too.
Kip.

54
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,940
What burglary?
GERALD: Sergeant.

55
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,100
Sergeant, why won't you take
my word for it?

56
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,460
You're not outback now, Mr McNaster.
We have rules.

57
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,700
That coin was handed in,
so unless you can prove ownership...

58
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,860
How can I prove anything
if you won't let me see it?

59
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,860
I'm a very busy man, sir.

60
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,380
So, in the absence of any evidence
of a break-in,

61
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,660
I'm afraid there's very little else
I can do.

62
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,860
Good day to you, sir.

63
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,460
Gerald.
Ah, Mrs Stanley.

64
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,620
Mother, I thought
you were going to telephone?

65
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,780
I'm afraid we'd already departed.

66
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,180
Hilly, my dear, you need help,
on all fronts.

67
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,620
You do realise that my niece
is a private detective

68
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,340
of the utmost discretion
and capability.

69
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,060
Indeed.
Is she really?

70
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,580
Specialises in murders. But I'm
sure she'll make do with a robbery.

71
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,820
Oh, well, I suppose
you'd better come in then.

72
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,820
PRUDENCE: I thought you'd never ask.

73
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,940
Hilly, so lovely to see you.
(Laughs) Good.

74
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,580
Here we are.

75
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,140
Perhaps we should leave the champagne
in the boot, Dot.

76
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,020
(Bottles clatter)

77
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,260
He rode a bicycle
to the top of the Andes,

78
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,500
drove a T-model Ford across India.

79
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,300
He's been attacked in jungles,
lost in deserts.

80
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,300
And once, he even had to drink
his own...

81
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,340
That's enough, young man.

82
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:41,740
Mr McNaster's activities are his
own business. More tea, thank you.

83
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,300
GERALD: Excuse my manners. It's been
a while since my last drink.

84
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,180
I always keep the study locked.

85
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,860
And the key with you?
Yes.

86
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,220
Though there's a spare one hidden
in a collar box in my bedroom.

87
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,460
I didn't even realise my doubloon
was missing

88
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,420
until I read this morning's paper.

89
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:08,500
Then when I checked,
I found my entire coin box was gone.

90
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,940
A doubloon? A souvenir
of your London to Peru attempt?

91
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,140
Yes, the only one.
We were flooded in.

92
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,100
I had to abandon the Oldsmobile...
At the foot of the Cordilleras.

93
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:25,100
Yes, I remember reading about it.
Really?

94
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:29,540
You have an interest in exploration?
I've dabbled.

95
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,860
So, the local police think

96
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,860
your doubloon is part
of the lost treasure of Queenscliff.

97
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,260
Yes, it's ridiculous.

98
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,540
At least he has more imagination
than I gave him credit for.

99
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,700
You and the local sergeant
don't see eye to eye?

100
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,860
Baxter? He bears a grudge.

101
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,420
My mother's Temperance Chapter

102
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,980
closed down his uncle's hotel
a year ago.

103
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,820
No mean feat to close down
a watering hole in a fishing town.

104
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,900
The Baxters were asking
for trouble,

105
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,780
doing a roaring trade
every night after six.

106
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:07,580
Really, Hilly, I can't believe you
let the Johnsons go without notice.

107
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,580
Since when do servants retire?
It's a vocation, not a job.

108
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,700
Where are those jade vases
I gave you?

109
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,140
Oh, they're in my bedroom, Prudence.

110
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,460
They suited my new curtains
beautifully.

111
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,100
Ahh.

112
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,140
Have you considered the theft
might be linked

113
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,100
to the Johnsons' sudden departure?

114
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,500
Well, I must admit, some things
have been going missing lately.

115
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,300
Just small things.

116
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,740
But the Johnsons have been devoted
to us for years, especially Mother.

117
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,340
What kind of things?

118
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,500
Some pieces of silverware,
some ornaments. Nothing like this.

119
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,380
Well, you do have
some tempting collections.

120
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,780
Do you like rocks, Miss Fisher?

121
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:09,820
I found this on a beach
in the Gulf of Carpentaria.

122
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,740
It took thousands of years
to create,

123
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,420
and you can hold it
in the palm of your hand.

124
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,020
Anything else missing?
Not that I've noticed.

125
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,700
Although I move things around a bit
while I'm cataloguing.

126
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:31,340
Sometimes I could lose track.
Yes, I can see that.

127
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,300
Clive and Moira Johnson, thieves?

128
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,500
One must never entirely trust
one's own staff, Hilly,

129
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,100
no matter how loyal they may seem.

130
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,820
But why would they suddenly start
stealing from us

131
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,300
after all this time?

132
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,100
Perhaps they need money
for some reason?

133
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,820
Ah, Mother knew them
better than I did.

134
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,100
HILLY: Well, Clive and Moira
weren't extravagant,

135
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,900
and they were utterly respectable.

136
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,900
They were the ones who introduced me
to the Temperance Union.

137
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,140
Oh, we have a thriving local chapter
here, darling.

138
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,900
You must come to a meeting.

139
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,420
(Chuckles) I must confess, Hilly,

140
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,580
even I have my limits
when it comes to the tambourine.

141
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,700
Perhaps the Temperance Union
landed them in some kind of trouble.

142
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,420
I'm sure not everyone in town
would agree with their views.

143
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,980
(Kettle whistles)

144
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,300
Do you think Mr McNaster would mind
if I had a look in his library?

145
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,780
Why don't you help me get the tea
ready first? We'll need more sugar.

146
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,260
Pantry?

147
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,580
It's up high. I'll get it for you.

148
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,220
Thank you, Kip.

149
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,660
(Whimpering)

150
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,940
What on earth is that?

151
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,540
JANE: Hello, boy.
KIP: Gaston!

152
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,460
What are you after?
It's the Johnsons' dog.

153
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,900
Mrs Jane dotes
on this little mongrel.

154
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,060
Shoo! Shoo!

155
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:01,340
What are you doing here, boy?
They'd never leave Gaston behind.

156
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,540
Whether they had a reason
to steal those coins or not,

157
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,340
the police should still be informed
of their departure.

158
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,420
No, no, I can't believe it.

159
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,380
They took their leave
and they went to the ferry.

160
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,740
Now, what robber would use
a getaway ferry?

161
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,180
And that Baxter will be no help
finding them.

162
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,300
He's delighted to have
my most valuable coin

163
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,780
in his lost property box.

164
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,620
What about your Inspector friend?

165
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,540
He's supposed to be a servant
of the people,

166
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,020
especially the right people.

167
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,860
Jack's supposed to be a servant
of the law, Aunt Prudence.

168
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,180
Excuse me? I think
you should come and see something.

169
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,660
Hey.

170
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,460
The Johnsons wouldn't leave
their dog. They're good people.

171
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,340
How long have you known them, Kip?
Four years I've been here.

172
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,380
They gave me work so I could look
after my gran and the other kids.

173
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,620
I could ask around and see
if anyone knows where he's been.

174
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,020
Good idea. I'll go too?
Excellent.

175
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,140
Come on, boy. Let's go.

176
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,740
Is that wise, Miss?

177
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,180
Are you worried they'll stumble
across a robber's lair,

178
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,300
or is it the twinkle
in Jane's eye that bothers you?

179
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,540
(Sighs) The whole world bothers me,
Miss.

180
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,980
You're sending her to the Continent
in a week.

181
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,620
It's an adventure, Dot.

182
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,060
A woman's rite of passage,
not an ordeal.

183
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,380
Will you at least chaperone her
on the beach?

184
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,900
Just as soon as I place
this telephone call.

185
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,820
Jack, I'm in desperate need
of a numismatist.

186
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,300
And I'm the only one you know?

187
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,420
I need your help
with a fellow coin collector

188
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,220
who's just been robbed
of his doubloon.

189
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,060
Anything like the one that's just
washed up from Bonito's treasure?

190
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,660
Sadly it's not pirate bounty.

191
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,460
It was stolen from Aunt Prudence's
good friends, the McNasters.

192
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,300
Gerald McNaster? He found a
Spanish doubloon in Peru, didn't he?

193
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,540
And his domestic staff
have mysteriously disappeared.

194
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,260
But it seems the local police
have a grudge against the McNasters,

195
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,140
and are refusing to investigate
the case at all.

196
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,140
Well, I'm not sure
what I can do from here.

197
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,500
Gerald has no proof
the coin belongs to him.

198
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,020
We need some sort of
archival evidence,

199
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:59,100
an entry in a journal,
a note from a museum?

200
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,220
And I have nothing better to do
with my time?

201
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,860
Well, you might,
but this is definitely more fun.

202
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,220
(Distant conversations)

203
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,460
JANE: What are they digging for?

204
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,460
They think that coin that washed up
is part of the lost loot of Lima.

205
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,940
Why would it be in Queenscliff?

206
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,980
A Spanish pirate ship tried to sail
from here a hundred years ago.

207
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,820
But the British got them
and hung the captain.

208
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,620
But Bonito outsmarted them
and hid the treasure first.

209
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:38,500
Could be anywhere here, buried
in the sand, hidden in a cave.

210
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,820
Over there.

211
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,060
I believe there's something curious
much closer to home.

212
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,100
How awful.
Do you think the tide washed him up?

213
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,340
I don't think the sea did this, Jane.

214
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,340
The water didn't come up
this far today.

215
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,340
Someone's covered him up
deliberately.

216
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,020
The police are on their way.
Thank you, Kip.

217
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,780
I've seen him before, Miss.
So have I.

218
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:22,180
That's Frank the Fish.
The fishmonger.

219
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,740
Do you know him, Mr...?
I'm Finlay Ellis.

220
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,900
We both knew him, Wally and me.

221
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,380
Frank used to crew on my boat.
Had to lay him off a while back.

222
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,900
A falling-out?

223
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,940
Couple of bad seasons,
as it happens.

224
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,020
Frank's had it rough himself
since then.

225
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,340
It's the demon drink.
That's what's killed him.

226
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,700
BAXTER: Alright, thanks. Move along.

227
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,220
Nothing to see. Constable, get these
people to stand back, thank you.

228
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,700
That's Mr Johnson's.

229
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,620
I'd know it anywhere.

230
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:59,060
Get that dog out of here.
And you too, madam.

231
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,220
This is a police matter now,
so thank you very much.

232
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,820
It's also the scene of a crime
and you're trampling all over it.

233
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,780
Sergeant Baxter, I presume.

234
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,260
Not now, thank you, madam,

235
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:13,620
and I'll decide
if this is a crime scene, thank you.

236
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:18,260
These gentlemen knew the deceased.
Is that right?

237
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:22,180
Then I'm sure that these gentlemen
will be only too happy

238
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,140
to remain here and assist
with any identification

239
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,620
after I peruse the body.

240
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,420
Isn't that right,
Mr Ellis and Mr Stirling?

241
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,940
Happy to help, Sergeant.

242
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,940
The skinny one was seen chasing him
earlier this morning.

243
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,700
And somebody covered up the body.

244
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,540
I will conduct the inquiry,
thank you, madam.

245
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:43,460
Now for the last time,
can you please just go home?

246
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,660
McNaster was right.
The man's a fool.

247
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,380
We definitely need someone
more competent.

248
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,700
A murder? I hope you didn't go
to any trouble on my account.

249
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,620
Well, I was tempted to do away
with the local sergeant

250
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:05,340
who has now proven himself to be both
incompetent as well as unpleasant.

251
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,820
I'm glad you resisted.

252
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,020
Though, strangely enough,
I did have my chance at the victim,

253
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,220
who threw himself in front
of my motor car this morning.

254
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,180
But survived?
Due to my excellent driving skills.

255
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,740
Only to be murdered on
the beachfront by the afternoon.

256
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,500
A local fishmonger
with an interesting connection

257
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:24,020
to our suspected coin robbers,
Mr and Mrs Johnson.

258
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,820
So it's 'our' robbers now?

259
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,220
If you leave immediately,
you'd be here in a couple of hours.

260
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,380
Some of us follow the speed limit.
If you insist. Two and a half.

261
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,980
Three.

262
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,860
Oh, good afternoon, Dorothy!

263
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,860
You're just in time, Mr Butler.
There's been a murder.

264
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,980
Will that be one less for dinner,
then?

265
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,060
One more, actually. Inspector
Robinson is joining us too.

266
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:04,500
Ah, you must be Kip.
Dot's told me all about you.

267
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,220
Can I take your bag, sir?

268
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:11,100
Oh, I can manage my bag.
But this is for you.

269
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,300
It's not new.

270
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,820
It used to be mine, when I started
out in service many years ago.

271
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,620
Thank you, Mr Butler.

272
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,100
Shall we?

273
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,900
PHRYNE (Whispering): Jack!
Shhh, Jack!

274
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,980
(Sighs)
(Pop!)

275
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,900
Jack, this is a temperance household.

276
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,980
The sound of a popping cork
could lead to my eviction.

277
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:46,100
More so than entertaining a man
in your private parlour?

278
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:49,820
A man? I thought
you were a police officer.

279
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,380
I'll try my best
to be less entertaining.

280
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,100
You should join Hilly's
Temperance Union.

281
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,580
Some of us are not here on holiday.

282
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,580
It doesn't have to be all work
and no play.

283
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,140
Besides, I'm not on holiday anymore.

284
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,580
I have a robbery, a body and two
missing servants on my plate.

285
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,740
I called into
the Queenscliff Morgue.

286
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,300
The fishmonger's body's been sent
to Melbourne for autopsy,

287
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:15,980
but Baxter's current view
is a drunken fall,

288
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,460
striking his head on a pier.

289
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:21,300
That man wouldn't know evidence if
he fell over it, which he almost did.

290
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,740
Luckily, I salvaged the treasure.

291
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:31,340
I saved it for you. You can have it
sent up to Melbourne for analysis.

292
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,380
(Clears throat) Pungent.

293
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,980
It could still make the night train
if we hurry.

294
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,620
Now, what time should I have
Cec and Bert pick it up?

295
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,380
Don't tell me,
it just fell into your hands.

296
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,180
After it fell out
of the dead man's pocket.

297
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,220
'My darling.'
Glad I'm forgiven.

298
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,340
'On our golden anniversary.'
Has it been that long?

299
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,620
From Mrs Johnson to Mr Johnson.

300
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,140
Presumed to have run off
with the stolen household items,

301
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,620
including the missing doubloon.

302
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,140
Any forwarding address?

303
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,540
They left with the ferry.
That's the last anyone heard of them.

304
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,780
Where's their quarters?
Already plundered.

305
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,580
The Temperance Union's battle plan.

306
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:15,500
'Lips that touch liquor
shall never touch mine'.

307
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,220
I preferred 'my darling'.

308
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,700
Two hotels closed, many more to go.

309
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:24,100
No wonder Baxter's
been dragging his heels.

310
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,180
The Johnsons were bad for business.

311
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,220
This town needs all the business
it can get.

312
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,940
Perhaps your view is clouded,
Sergeant,

313
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,620
because your family were publicans.

314
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,980
I want to know where
the Johnsons were going,

315
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,460
when they were last seen.

316
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,100
Friends, associates, enemies.

317
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,820
Start searching now,
that's an order.

318
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:47,100
And I want a proper report
on that dead body by the morning.

319
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,740
Yes, sir.

320
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,820
Very dashing, Kip.

321
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,540
So you think there's some connection

322
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,420
between those terrible murders
and the departure of the Johnsons?

323
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:08,020
What? How could they have anything
to do with the poor fishmonger?

324
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,900
Oh, m-mere speculation
at this point, Mrs Stanley.

325
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,860
The police are looking
into both matters.

326
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,140
Ah, I see.
Strange about the watch, though.

327
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,700
PRUDENCE: What watch?

328
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,540
Mrs McNaster, I was hoping
to speak with your son.

329
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,140
Do you know when he's available?
Oh, Gerald arrived home ages ago.

330
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,660
He's in the study. He's still
looking for the mould, I imagine.

331
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,140
Mould?

332
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,900
Well, I reminded him he took a cast
of the Spanish doubloon.

333
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,060
You know, the coin
the police are hanging onto.

334
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,900
So that would be proof of ownership?

335
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:41,300
Yes, but he seems to have
lost track of it.

336
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,900
JACK: I found the photograph
in the Geographic Annual.

337
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,300
Unfortunately, I doubt
there's enough detail

338
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,860
to identify the doubloon.

339
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,500
But your mother said
that you made a mould?

340
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,980
Well, yes.

341
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,340
I made plaster casts
of some of my collection

342
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,740
for the Larco Museum in Lima.

343
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,780
Perhaps we could help you
look for them.

344
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,980
Oh, don't worry, I've tried. But
I'm afraid I've disposed of them.

345
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,420
I've put out word in Melbourne,

346
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,180
in case it turns up
on the black market.

347
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,140
But I understand other coins
went missing.

348
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,980
Yes, my entire collection,

349
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,100
although nothing as rare
as that particular doubloon.

350
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,620
Did you notice anything unusual
on your return?

351
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:20,140
There was no supper laid out,
and the household staff had gone.

352
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,900
Eventually, Mother explained
that the Johnsons had left.

353
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,860
She was terribly upset.
And then?

354
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,900
I made some cocoa.
We played a few hands of cards.

355
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,740
I thought it may distract her,
but it didn't seem to help.

356
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:37,860
Which reminds me,
I should see to Mother. Excuse me.

357
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,260
(Door opens and creaks)

358
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:48,140
Have you considered young Kip in
all of this? He had the opportunity.

359
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,980
Jack, that boy can keep secrets

360
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,780
for about as long
as I can stand still.

361
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,260
Besides, what's his motive?

362
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,700
The same as anyone else
digging out there,

363
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,180
the hope of an easier life.

364
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,060
Then how do you explain
the fisherman with the fob watch?

365
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,620
Perhaps he wasn't acting alone.
You said he knew the fishmonger.

366
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,620
(Knocking, door opens)

367
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:08,420
This is for you, Inspector.
Thank you.

368
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,940
No head injury.

369
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,700
No sign of any injury,
apart from a broken front tooth.

370
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,860
The trickle of blood.
Cause of death?

371
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:27,140
Still to be determined, and awaiting
results on the stomach contents.

372
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,300
I think we need to take another look
at our crime scene.

373
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,100
The ferry leaves from here.

374
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:39,700
The coin was found in the shallows,
but if the whole box was dropped,

375
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,660
the coins could have fallen
through the cracks,

376
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,820
and been washed in by the tide.

377
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,460
What does this stain
look like to you?

378
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,700
Blood? Fish, perhaps?

379
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:00,980
There are no scales.
Could have been here a while.

380
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,740
It poured with rain
the day before we arrived.

381
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,420
(Sniffs) This has been here two days
at the most.

382
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,180
We need to find out who moors here.

383
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,540
Special delivery.
Ah.

384
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,180
Inspector Robinson in Queenscliff.
Good, I've been expecting this.

385
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:34,780
What's he doing in Queenscliff?
Having a holiday?

386
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:39,020
(Slurring) While the boss is away,
the workers play?

387
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:44,020
Not you, eh? Not you, Collins.

388
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,100
Our Dottie wouldn't put up
with that.

389
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,660
Bert, it's nine in the morning.

390
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,980
Never too early to fall off
the back of a truck.

391
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:53,420
Come on, get out. Now, come on.
A train!

392
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:58,820
It was a train. Fritz von Opel could
use that stuff for rocket fuel.

393
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,220
I should lock him up for drunk
and disorderly.

394
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,780
(Thud!)

395
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,260
BERT: Oh!

396
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,540
Could ya? Just for a bit?

397
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,500
There seem to be quite a few items
of silver missing.

398
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:21,540
Oh, dear! Well, we'll make a list.

399
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,740
Mr Butler, I know a good servant
doesn't gossip about his employer,

400
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,580
but what if it was something fishy?

401
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,900
Something that might have to do with
what Jane and me found yesterday?

402
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:35,460
Jane and I.
It's about Mrs McNaster.

403
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,100
Look, there are times

404
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:42,780
when discretion needs to give way
to common sense.

405
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,740
It's about the dead bloke, Miss.

406
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,220
Mrs McNaster used to buy
her fish from him,

407
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,180
but she used to pay him herself.

408
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,380
And one time I saw her giving him

409
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,260
a couple of candle holders,
silver ones.

410
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,740
Really?

411
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,620
I told Mrs J about it, and her
and Mr J went to talk to her,

412
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,740
but Mrs McNaster made a big fuss.

413
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,660
Crying and carrying on.
When was this?

414
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,740
Not long before
the Johnsons went away.

415
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,140
I hope I've done the right thing,
telling you.

416
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,500
You certainly have, Kip. Thank you.

417
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,660
I can't believe it!
Hilly in financial difficulties?

418
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,340
Surely she'd tell me.

419
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,220
Perhaps it's a matter of pride?

420
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,260
Perhaps the Johnsons
didn't retire after all,

421
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,420
but she was forced to let them go
because she couldn't afford them.

422
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:36,820
We know she was bartering
for groceries.

423
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,580
What?
Paying in kind.

424
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,460
Silverware, missing vases.

425
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,340
But she said they suited
her bedroom.

426
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,260
I checked, Aunt P.

427
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:52,660
They were my wedding present to her.
Exchanged for produce?

428
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:57,540
I suppose this means you...

429
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,340
you think that Hilly
killed the fishmonger?

430
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,940
No, Aunt P.
Oh, thank goodness!

431
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,900
But I do think it's all
somehow linked.

432
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,380
(Footsteps approach)

433
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,180
Ah, Miss Fisher.

434
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,780
Has your handsome friend
managed to retrieve my son's coin?

435
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:16,940
My...? Oh, the Inspector.
Ah, I'm not sure, Mrs McNaster.

436
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,820
Hilly, dear,

437
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:22,740
Gerald's expeditions
must have been very costly.

438
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,780
Well, of course,
but of course he's so well regarded,

439
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,500
he's always picking up grants
and patrons and such.

440
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:32,260
I wondered, with the household
so diminished...

441
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,460
Really, Prudence,
that is none of your concern.

442
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:42,340
You would tell me if you were in any
sort of straightened circumstances?

443
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,780
I... I don't know where
this is leading, Prudence.

444
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,980
I-Isn't your accommodation
satisfactory?

445
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,620
Isn't the catering up to scratch?

446
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,900
I know I have had trouble
with my staff,

447
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,940
but I... I will try harder
to meet with your approval.

448
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:59,260
Oh, you already have!
I... I've no complaints.

449
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:02,820
Oh! Well good, then.

450
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:07,020
Ladies, luncheon is served.

451
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,300
(Exhales)

452
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:13,020
Are you alright, Hilly?
Mm.

453
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,980
Are you sure?
Yes.

454
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,940
Any luck with the Johnsons?
JACK: Not yet.

455
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,580
Seems they bought tickets
for the ferry, but never caught it.

456
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,620
And Sergeant Baxter is giving us
the run around, as usual.

457
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,620
He says he's shipped that coin off
to Warrnambool

458
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,340
for authentication
at the Maritime Museum.

459
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,980
Would you like something to eat,
dear?

460
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:50,460
No, thank you, Mother.
I've lost my appetite.

461
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:54,100
Well, would you care to sit down
and eat, Inspector?

462
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,260
Thank you.

463
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,020
Thank you, Mr Butler.

464
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,220
Did you find out
about the next full tide?

465
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:09,020
Early morning. Very early.

466
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:25,460
What took you so long?
(Sighs) I was as quiet as a mouse.

467
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:28,260
A mouse who wears French perfume.

468
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,820
I'll wear less next time.

469
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:37,380
Is that the boat?
Yes, they're tying up now.

470
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,540
Let's go find a mouse hole.

471
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,980
FINLAY: Come on, Wally,
give us a hand, will ya?

472
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,420
Hey, come on! Get it up, get it up!

473
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:53,300
(Clattering, distant shouting)

474
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,300
Will you shut your gap! You'll have
half of Queenscliff down here.

475
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,540
The dead fishmonger
crewed for the big fellow.

476
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,740
Wally, get the cart.

477
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,340
And that's the one I saw chasing him
the morning we arrived.

478
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,380
Going over.

479
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,580
(Water laps softly)

480
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,300
(Small splash)

481
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:38,980
I think we've seen all we need to
for the moment, don't you?

482
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,460
It's only right
that I escort you home.

483
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,620
If you insist.

484
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,700
(Splashing)

485
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,180
The analysis shows it's a lot more
potent than standard rum, sir.

486
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,140
So it is bootleg?
Ah, yes, sir.

487
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,740
Grave potential
to cause alcoholic poisoning.

488
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,660
Back cell.
Collins?

489
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,260
Yes. No, yes, sir. I'll send
it down for you right away, sir.

490
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:06,220
Better still, Collins, come down
and bring those reports with you.

491
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,700
To Queenscliff, sir?

492
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,700
I need someone on the ground
I can rely on.

493
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:13,940
Hey! Hey, no, not so fast.
JACK: Collins? Collins?

494
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,460
Oh, no, we're not wearing that.

495
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,060
It was forced on us.
We were only there to do a job.

496
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:21,100
What's going on, Collins?
No, it's... no, it's nothing, sir.

497
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,100
It's nothing. I'll be on the next
train down. Thank you, sir. Goodbye.

498
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,540
The bloke said it was cheap 'cause
it came straight from the brewery.

499
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,820
No middle man.
We didn't know it was bootleg.

500
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,620
What bloke?
Some bloke.

501
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,220
He collected a cart load
from the guard's van, yesterday,

502
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,340
when we picked up the parcel
for Miss Fisher.

503
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,940
But this bottle was the parcel,
so this isn't your grog.

504
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,300
This was found on a victim
in Queenscliff.

505
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:49,460
Same bottle. Oh! Same grog.
Flint's Rum.

506
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,140
Victim of what?

507
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,620
We don't know yet.
He only died yesterday.

508
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,060
(Seagulls squawk)

509
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,020
Madam.

510
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,460
'Morning!

511
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,700
Oh. Oh, yes, I'm sure it is.

512
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:35,140
I... I can't seem to find
what I'm looking for.

513
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,700
'Morning, everyone.

514
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:41,060
That is the dinner setting, Kip.

515
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,940
Ah, we don't have a full service
breakfast setting.

516
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,460
You're absolutely hopeless.

517
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,460
Take off that uniform
and go back to the scullery.

518
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,340
You're not fit to be
in polite society!

519
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,780
He has improved, Hilly.
Calm yourself, please.

520
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:56,300
And the breakfast setting
is incomplete, Mrs McNaster.

521
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:02,620
Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry.
I'm... I'm not myself this morning.

522
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,500
I will go and fetch Mrs McNaster,

523
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:11,340
bring her down back to breakfast
again, and all will be forgotten.

524
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:17,100
'Morning, Jack.
'Morning.

525
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,220
DOT: I'll help with the tea.
So will I.

526
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,860
That bottle we sent to Melbourne...
Shhh!

527
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,580
So much
for the temperance household.

528
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:50,220
According to Collins,
your friends, Bert and Cec,

529
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,700
witnessed a crate load
of those bottles

530
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:55,500
arriving in Melbourne yesterday,
on the Queenscliff train.

531
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:58,980
So now we need to find a link
between those bottles,

532
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,860
and that clinking midnight cargo.

533
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:04,580
Constable Collins is arriving to
help us with inquiries this morning.

534
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,580
I said we'd meet him at the pier.

535
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:10,380
Good.
Who knows what we might reel in?

536
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,380
(Muffled speech)

537
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:20,620
PHRYNE: Oh, dear, I hope that's not
what I think it is.

538
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,780
Oh, my Lord, it's
Moira and Clive Johnson!

539
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,700
If these are our thieves,
they paid a terrible price.

540
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,580
The other night. I saw you haggling
for them and look at them now.

541
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,260
You've got something to do with it.

542
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,260
I'll take Ellis.
I saw you with my own eyes.

543
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,780
Don't know what
you're talking about.

544
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,580
Inspector Jack Robinson.

545
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,940
I'm keen to know about the cargo
you unloaded last night,

546
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,420
from the Kennocha.

547
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,580
I was heading home after our
meeting, when I saw them out here.

548
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,060
It must have been after eight,

549
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,220
because the ferry
was already heading out.

550
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,100
So Mr Ellis's fishing boat
was moored at the pier that night?

551
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,260
Yes, this side, where I could see.

552
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:08,260
The boats were in,
the tide must have been up.

553
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,660
I don't know
what you're talking about.

554
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:15,620
I'm allowed to carry goods
and if I want to unload at night,

555
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:18,140
well, that's my business, isn't it?

556
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,660
Alright, stand back.

557
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:23,020
Is the blood on the pier
your business as well, Mr Ellis?

558
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,820
Next to where you moor your boat?

559
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,020
There's blood all over that pier.

560
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:30,660
It's a working port.
Fish, bait, blood.

561
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,300
And corpses.

562
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,420
What were you arguing about
with Mr and Mrs Johnson

563
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,980
the evening that they disappeared?

564
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:39,340
They wanted a ride to Sorrento.
I said no.

565
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,420
There's a ferry, isn't there?
They'd just missed it.

566
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,780
They offered a decent fare,
but I declined.

567
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,300
I had other plans,
like a drink with the lads.

568
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,260
And I suppose
you were drinking together

569
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,500
when the fishmonger
was killed as well.

570
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,580
What are you trying to say?

571
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:59,100
Those two were still alive when I
left the pier. Ask any of my crew.

572
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:03,060
Ask my deckhand, Wally.
We may just do that, Mr Ellis.

573
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,820
In the meantime,
please don't leave Queenscliff.

574
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:09,140
I've got fish to catch,
and a boat to pay for.

575
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:15,620
'Morning, sir. Miss Fisher.
Very timely, Collins.

576
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:20,140
It certainly looks like it, sir.
I'll go break the bad news.

577
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:25,300
I... I should have stayed
in my room.

578
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:28,180
PRUDENCE: There now, Hilly,
calm yourself.

579
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,180
Two more dead bodies?

580
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,860
Isn't that a little excessive,
Phryne, even for you?

581
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,020
I didn't put in a request,
Aunt Prudence.

582
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:39,220
Were any of Gerald's coins found
on the bodies?

583
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:42,020
Apparently not.
That's a relief.

584
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:45,660
BUTLER: A hot, sweet tea will help.
Thank you, Mr Butler.

585
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,900
They... They gave it back to me.

586
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,300
They brought me in
and simply handed it over,

587
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,420
as they should have done,
three days ago.

588
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,700
At least something good
has happened.

589
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,980
This doubloon, it's the only coin
that means anything to me, Mother.

590
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,100
The rest, they... they don't matter.

591
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,940
Baxter didn't tell you
about the murders, then?

592
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:11,260
Murders?
PRUDENCE: Try to relax.

593
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,060
The Johnsons' bodies
have been dredged up.

594
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:19,980
Good Lord, that's hideous!
How... how did they die?

595
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,980
Laceration to the forearm
from a large bladed implement,

596
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,620
and a major, rear penetrative wound

597
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,860
through the victim's stomach
and liver.

598
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:31,140
That would do it.
And the wife?

599
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:39,580
Some superficial bruising
to the face and lips.

600
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,500
Cause of death, suffocation.

601
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,020
If the Johnsons found out

602
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,380
that Finlay Ellis and his crew
were smuggling illegal rum...

603
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,860
And confronted him?

604
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,420
Or threatened to expose him,
Ellis wouldn't have been happy.

605
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,820
But unhappy enough to motivate
a murder, or two?

606
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,620
Or three. The fishmonger
could have been found out as well.

607
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,820
Local sales could just be the tip
of the iceberg.

608
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,060
Ships sail past here every day,
bound for America.

609
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,620
We need to prove
what Ellis has been up to.

610
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,740
Let's hope Collins has found
our middle man.

611
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,460
(Sighs)

612
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,940
And you don't have any other records
for parcel delivery?

613
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,500
No. That's the last seven days.

614
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,900
Everything loaded on here
heading east or west.

615
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,100
Mm-hm.
Anything else I can help you with?

616
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,700
No, that'll be all for now.
Thank you, Mr Redwin.

617
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:24,860
Good-o, then. I'm due on the 2:30.
Happy to assist, Constable.

618
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,940
That man was far too helpful.

619
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,620
Some people have no difficulty
cooperating with the police.

620
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:37,900
Dottie! Ah,
would you excuse me, please, sir?

621
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:43,100
Ah, go on.
Look over here, Jack.

622
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,500
Constable Collins is on duty.
Then you can blame Dot.

623
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:53,340
You mean that guard?
The man I was questioning.

624
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,180
About what?
Some boxes in Melbourne.

625
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,860
I need to tell Miss Fisher
something.

626
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:04,140
Excuse me, Inspector, Miss.

627
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,780
Hugh said he was questioning
that guard about some boxes

628
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,380
that ended up in Melbourne?
Go on.

629
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,060
Well, when I came to meet Mr Butler,

630
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,660
I saw that guard
signalling to another man

631
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,380
with a trolley loading some boxes.

632
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:19,100
Description, Dot.
You know him, Miss.

633
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,940
He was chasing that fellow
you almost ran over

634
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,540
when we arrived in town
two days ago.

635
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:28,060
Wally Stirling.
Finlay Ellis's deckhand.

636
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:32,500
As I said, far too helpful.

637
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,500
I want a signed statement
from that guard, Collins.

638
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,500
Everything he knows
about Wally Stirling.

639
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:40,300
And warn him we have a witness.
Yes, sir.

640
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:43,100
I think it's time
to divide and conquer.

641
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:46,780
I'll see how Finlay Ellis
likes the idea of his deckhand

642
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:49,540
confessing to a sideline
in rail deliveries.

643
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,540
And I'll tell Wally Stirling
it was Ellis who turned him in.

644
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:55,660
That's not what Finlay Ellis says.

645
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,460
He told the police
you were smuggling cheap rum

646
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,940
up to Melbourne on the train.

647
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,940
What? He could be trying
to save his own skin.

648
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,140
But he implied Frank the fishmonger
knew about it as well.

649
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,580
Look, I already told you,

650
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,180
I don't know nothing
about no smuggling, alright?

651
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,660
Neither did Frank.

652
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,140
Then I wonder what Frank's
connection was

653
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,620
to those bodies that were dredged up?

654
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,220
Frank had nothing to do with that.

655
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,220
Then how did he come across
Mr Johnson's fob watch?

656
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:17,180
I heard the police found it
in his pocket.

657
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:20,940
The problem is, Finlay Ellis
was seen arguing with those people,

658
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,620
and now they're dead.

659
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,260
I don't know anything about that.

660
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,740
The police think
they were murdered

661
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,620
because they found out
about a smuggling racket.

662
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,260
And Finlay Ellis told them
it was all your idea.

663
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:35,260
No. No, that argument had nothing
to do with smuggling.

664
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,860
No, from what I heard,
they missed the ferry,

665
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,500
they asked him for a trip
to Sorrento,

666
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,100
and he told me he wouldn't take 'em.

667
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:44,340
Now you tell me,
why would he killed them over that?

668
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:49,380
I don't know. Perhaps you should ask
Mr Ellis yourself.

669
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:58,180
(Sighs) This is taking a while.

670
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:01,140
Do you think we set a big enough cat
amongst the pigeons?

671
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,460
Depending on the pigeons.
FINLAY: Oi!

672
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,500
Wally! What the hell's
been going on?

673
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:15,180
You stupid bastard! You been
helping yourself to the merchandise.

674
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:17,820
So I passed Frank a few cases,
so what?

675
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,620
I didn't know he'll flog them
in town.

676
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,700
You've brought the coppers
down on us!

677
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,260
Not my fault. I tried to fix things.
By killing Frank?

678
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,740
Someone put the wind up him.

679
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,820
He was going to Baxter,
reveal the whole operation.

680
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,780
I had to shut him up, alright?
To protect you!

681
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:34,780
Protect your own backside, you mean.
Oh, come on.

682
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,820
(Grunting)

683
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,420
(Growling)

684
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,820
HUGH: Stop! Police!

685
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,300
Yes?

686
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:51,740
Hey! Hey! Hey!
I suggest you put that down!

687
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,060
Put down the knife, Ellis.

688
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,860
Aargh!

689
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:06,980
Don't try to get up.
I don't want to ruin my heels.

690
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,980
I'm arresting you
for the murder of Frank McKay,

691
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,740
also known as Frank the Fish.

692
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,100
And you're being
held under suspicion.

693
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,500
I didn't kill Frank.

694
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:20,740
Let me clarify. Suspicion of
murdering Clive and Moira Johnson.

695
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,180
I didn't kill anyone!
Move.

696
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,820
There are numerous witnesses
to your argument,

697
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,020
and it was clearly about more
than just a ferry ride.

698
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,900
Half the town hates them.

699
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:36,780
With their protests
and their preaching.

700
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:39,340
But what they were going on about
made no sense.

701
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,340
What were they going on about?

702
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,780
They were blaming me
for Mrs McNaster being in a bad way.

703
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,420
Said it was my fault
for supplying her with the drink.

704
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,500
But you didn't know
it was Frank's sideline, did you?

705
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:54,020
He let you down,
just like Wally Stirling did.

706
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:59,140
Frank was a fool. But he didn't
deserve to die like that.

707
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:03,700
Like what?
Dead drunk from illicit rum?

708
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,380
Or do you mean choking on a bottle

709
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,860
that was shoved so far down
his throat it broke his teeth?

710
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:21,140
Wally did it. He must have killed
the Johnsons, too.

711
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,620
Go on.

712
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,340
He heard me arguing with them
that night,

713
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,460
and he knew it'd all come out.

714
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,940
He was the last one
to leave the boat.

715
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,740
He must have stayed behind
to shut 'em up.

716
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,220
On the pier?

717
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:35,180
That's where we found them
when we came back in the morning.

718
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:39,980
Frank and me. Both of them.
They were already dead.

719
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:43,020
And Frank helped you
get rid of the bodies?

720
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,660
We carried them up to the end,

721
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,460
where we knew the tide
would take them out.

722
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,940
(Splash!)

723
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,660
So if Wally Stirling
killed the Johnsons,

724
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,660
where did you get that knife?

725
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:00,220
The one we saw you
throw into the water.

726
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:04,780
I found that on the pier.
Same time we found the bodies.

727
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,940
Constable.

728
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,740
Take Mr Ellis down to the cells,
thank you.

729
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,980
Considering we have no weapon
and no witnesses,

730
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,820
it's his word
against Wally Stirling's.

731
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:33,140
BAXTER: Ellis is guilty.
Let's face it.

732
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:37,860
What kind of fool would clean up
after a murder they had no part in?

733
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:41,900
That's the first sensible thing I've
heard you say. Pity if you're wrong.

734
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,420
By the way, Inspector,

735
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:50,620
somewhere here I have a telegram
that came for you

736
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:54,100
from the Melbourne Museum,
I believe.

737
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:58,620
Well, looks like a response
to our coin inquiries.

738
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:01,340
A doubloon minted in 1798

739
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,980
went missing from their display
three years ago.

740
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,260
Well, that doesn't help us at all.
No.

741
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:11,180
Different doubloon.
McNaster's was minted in 1790.

742
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:18,740
Hilly! Oh, Hilly!

743
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:27,860
My God! Help!
Somebody, come quickly!

744
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,540
Help! It's Hilly!

745
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:35,620
Oh, dear. Hilly! Hilly!

746
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,620
(Hilly moans)

747
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:41,740
Come on. We'll get you out.
Out of the bath.

748
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,740
(Hilly moans)
Lean on me.

749
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,780
There we go.
(Slurs while speaking)

750
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:50,660
What the devil?
Get back!

751
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:53,060
What the devil's going on?
Get back! You can't come in here!

752
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,900
What's going on in there?
Please, get out.

753
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,700
(Moans)

754
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,700
Hilly, it's alright now.

755
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:01,940
PRUDENCE: Get her into bed.

756
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:08,700
Get her a nightie.
I think they're in that drawer.

757
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:14,740
I thought she'd drowned.
She almost did, in rum.

758
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,540
I-It's my fault. It's all my fault.

759
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:20,100
What on earth's going on here?

760
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:23,100
Get Mr Butler to bring up
some coffee, preferably strong.

761
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:28,420
It was medicinal at first,
and then I just needed it.

762
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,620
I couldn't have you knowing, Gerald.

763
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:33,580
So you bought it cheaply
from the fishmonger?

764
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:36,580
Well, at first I was paying it
out of the housekeeping money,

765
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:39,580
but then Gerald likes to account
for every penny.

766
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:42,380
Mother, so that's where

767
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,580
all the ornaments and the silverware
were going?

768
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:48,180
Well, the fishmonger said he'd tell
everybody what a hypocrite I am.

769
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,260
I had to pay him as best I could.

770
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:55,420
And the Johnsons?
Well, they found out about it.

771
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:57,620
They tried to help me, they did.

772
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:02,900
And then I lapsed once too often
and they just resigned.

773
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:06,060
And you insisted on the dignity
of at least paying them.

774
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:07,740
With Gerald's coins.

775
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,740
Well, I couldn't let them go
with nothing,

776
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:14,620
after all those years of service,
and they'd been so good to me.

777
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:19,260
I had no idea.
The money, the corner you were in.

778
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:24,820
So... the night the Johnsons left,
you'd been drinking?

779
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:30,020
That's what was wrong with you.
You should have told me.

780
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:33,020
I'm sorry, Gerald,
it just got out of hand.

781
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,700
And I remember sitting down
to bridge,

782
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:38,980
and then it's all a blur.

783
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:44,260
The cards and the cocoa.
I just can't remember any of it.

784
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:48,260
Kip, on the night the Johnsons left,
Gerald made cocoa for his mother.

785
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:51,820
What time was that?
Cocoa, Miss? I don't understand.

786
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:56,860
He said he made a cup for his mother.
Ah, I don't reckon so.

787
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:00,180
See, of an evening
I'm meant to go home,

788
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,780
but there's no room at my gran's,

789
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:05,780
so the Johnsons let me sleep
in the pantry.

790
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:08,580
And I would have known
if anyone was at the stove.

791
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:16,100
Dot, do you suppose Hugh
brought along his bathing suit?

792
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:18,980
I can ask, Miss.

793
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:39,260
Found it!
What a feat, Hugh!

794
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:43,780
Worthy of a bronze medallion.
Well done, Collins.

795
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:49,620
You were under for ages.
I thought you'd drowned. (Chuckles)

796
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:58,100
So we've got a dagger.
Hm, looks like a collector's piece.

797
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:00,260
(Lock clatters)

798
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:51,820
Queenscliff Police Station.

799
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:58,940
Jack, the dagger belongs to Gerald.
So how did it get to the pier?

800
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:01,020
I'm not sure he's being
entirely truthful with us.

801
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:03,420
He lied about making his mother
cocoa the night of the theft.

802
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:04,900
Why would he do that?

803
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:07,180
Perhaps he was busy
doing something else.

804
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:13,300
Chasing up his missing doubloon,
for example, or doubloons, plural.

805
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:15,060
Do you happen to have
that telegram handy?

806
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:17,580
Um... Yes.

807
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:21,260
What year was
the museum's doubloon minted?

808
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:22,820
1798.

809
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,380
(Telephone tings)

810
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:31,140
Miss Fisher? Miss Fisher!

811
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:34,220
Nothing does get past you, does it?

812
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:43,100
You already had a doubloon.

813
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:47,380
Why steal the museum's one?
They deserved it.

814
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:49,620
They refused to fund me
because I couldn't promise

815
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:53,380
to bring back more precious curios
for their glass cabinets.

816
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:56,500
As if that was ever the aim
of true adventuring.

817
00:48:56,660 --> 00:49:00,260
What about the Johnsons? You took
their lives for a box of coins.

818
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:01,940
Those coins were mine!

819
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,020
If only she'd told me,

820
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:12,820
instead of giving away
the greatest find of my career!

821
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:16,700
The Johnsons were people, Gerald.
I could not hesitate!

822
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:18,420
(Dog barks)

823
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:21,660
(Indistinct shouting, clattering)

824
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:33,860
You hesitate out there,
you're finished!

825
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:38,300
All he had to do was hand them over.
But he wouldn't!

826
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:40,500
(Gasps and pants)

827
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:42,580
I held her down.

828
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:02,500
And when the museum's doubloon
was dug up in the sand?

829
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,540
Instead of reading
about your murders,

830
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:08,300
all you read about was treasure.

831
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:11,820
It was my reprieve.

832
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:16,140
That's all I need, Miss Fisher,
one last reprieve.

833
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:17,660
JACK: Miss Fisher! Phryne!

834
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:20,020
Argh! Aaaargh!

835
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:27,580
Thank you, Jack. I don't think
there'll be any need for that.

836
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:43,540
More tea, madam?
Oh, no, thank you.

837
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:49,300
The motor car is packed, Miss.
Thank you, Mr Butler.

838
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,420
The Inspector had to leave?

839
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:52,940
He's gone back to Melbourne,

840
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:56,300
to return the illicit doubloon
to the museum.

841
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:59,100
I must confess to some relief.

842
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:02,860
I don't think I could face him
after the arrest of my son.

843
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:06,420
Oh, Prudence.

844
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:09,220
You know, I was never good enough
for Warleigh Grammar,

845
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:10,700
and this just proves it.

846
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:12,700
Oh, what nonsense!
No, it's true.

847
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,260
For this to happen with my son,

848
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:20,420
and now you know the worst
about me, let alone poor Gerald.

849
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:25,780
Hilly, do you remember
those hours spent over Virgil?

850
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:31,980
Omnia vincit amor.
Love conquers all.

851
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:39,340
I'm going to stay on here a few days
and we'll face society together.

852
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:43,100
Thank you.
Oh, darling.

853
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:08,300
What a shame. Gerald achieved
extraordinary things in his lifetime.

854
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,740
He was a true adventurer.

855
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:13,660
Pity his last great adventure
will be jail.

856
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:19,340
So, tell me, Jack.
Where did you collect your coins?

857
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:25,060
Amongst the ruins of ancient Greece,
or deep in the jungles of Patagonia?

858
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:30,140
I inherited my collection from Uncle
Ted and sold it at the age of 12,

859
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:32,100
so I could buy my first bicycle.

860
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:34,780
Now that's an adventure.
It was. It was.

861
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:37,620
I rode further
than I'd ever ridden before,

862
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:40,420
through the uncharted wilds
of North Richmond.

863
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:42,540
Where even Captain Flint
didn't dare tread.

864
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:45,740
And the pirate girls of Collingwood
ruled the waves.

865
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:50,820
To pirates, adventurers
and boys on bicycles.

866
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:52,660
