1
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:38,329
  Peace is an illusion.

2
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:42,000
And no matter how tranquil the world seems...

3
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:44,919
peace doesn't last long.

4
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:59,434
Peace is a struggle against our very nature.

5
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,608
A skin we stretch over the bone, muscle, and sinew

6
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:09,319
of our own innate savagery.

7
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:17,911
What are you doing?

8
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:19,996
We can't just leave her here.

9
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,957
 She's not our problem. You want to get us arrested?

10
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:24,626
Just...

11
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,337
let her go.

12
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:37,847
  The instinct of violence curls inside us like a parasite,

13
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:43,144
waiting for a chance to feed on our rage and multiply until it bursts out of us.

14
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:48,691
War is the only thing we really understand.

15
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,915
Long live the Uprising!

16
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,877
Long live Quellcrist Falconer... 

17
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,839
Long live Quellcrist Falconer!

18
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,483
Christ.

19
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,490
Ah, for fuck's sake.

20
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,870
No hookers. Just get out of my room.

21
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:45,874
-I'd love to, but I have a job to do. -You can keep what he paid you.

22
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,668
How generous of you. But then it's not your money, is it?

23
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:52,881
This is not a siren of the night. Ms. Prescott is an attorney.

24
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,049
Your hotel seems more perceptive than you.

25
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,593
That's disappointing,

26
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,554
in view of the trouble and expense Mr. Bancroft has taken to acquire you.

27
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,223
Oh, you work for Bancroft.

28
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,601
Exclusively. May I have my...

29
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:05,935
Where's my clothes?

30
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,272
If by "clothes" you mean those bloodstained rags, here they are.

31
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,609
But I took the liberty of procuring habiliments

32
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:16,487
more appropriate for your position as a confidant of a Meth.

33
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,324
He's not a confidant. He's a hired gun.

34
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:22,577
Take her downstairs. And if it's not too much trouble,

35
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,371
don't let anyone else into my fucking room.

36
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,552
Hey, Hawkeye.

37
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,638
 Hello, Lieutenant Ortega.

38
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,182
Would you like information on the target?

39
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:47,477
I slept great, thanks. You?

40
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,605
I'm afraid I don't understand the question.

41
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:54,609
 That's a nicer answer than most guys I wake up next to.

42
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,278
I'm afraid I don't understand the question.

43
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,780
 Forget it, Hawkeye.

44
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,158
Just let me know if Kovacs goes anywhere.

45
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:18,258
 This is not how normal people start the day.

46
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,135
-Coffee, cereal maybe. -Come on.

47
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,805
Toast. Maybe even toast with another person--

48
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:26,015
- -I don't want any toast.

49
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:30,770
It can be nice, wake up next to someone, have toast.

50
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:37,193
I don't want to hear your suggestions for my personal life.

51
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,654
What personal life would that be?

52
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,461
You need to blank this noise.

53
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,967
Doesn't matter who Kovacs is, you can't let him rattle you this much.

54
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,845
I know Bancroft's yanking your chain so hard

55
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,596
-you're gonna get whiplash. -

56
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:07,974
-What was that? -

57
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,017
One more round?

58
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,185
-That was a tracker. -

59
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,438
Except, of course, it can't be,

60
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,898
since we don't have a warrant on any of our open cases.

61
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,903
You know, if I saw this, I'd have to report it.

62
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,200
So it's a good thing I didn't.

63
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,828
Don't thank me. Just stop.

64
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,497
Forget about Kovacs. There's nothing there.

65
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,291
You think I don't know that?

66
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,992
 Hawkeye, target location.

67
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,079
  Processing target movements.

68
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,916
Target is in Psychasec, Mission Branch.

69
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,088
  Welcome to Psychasec.

70
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,340
Please step up to the ID plate.

71
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:27,261
Ms. Prescott. Mr. Kovacs.

72
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,014
Director Nyman will be down in a moment.

73
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:34,811
Gonna need to interview Bancroft's associates. Personal and business.

74
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:38,022
Kind of people in Mr. Bancroft's circle, it's out of the question.

75
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,318
Go tell your boss you've decided it's too socially awkward for me to save his life.

76
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,778
I'm sure he'll understand.

77
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:45,488
For the record,

78
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,699
I consider you to be completely unqualified as an investigator,

79
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:49,909
and you can't smoke in here.

80
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,454
Personally, I hate these things, but...

81
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,456
you sleeved me in a hardcore nicotine addict.

82
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,709
This sleeve is more than adequate for your needs.

83
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,169
I doubt you'll be using it long.

84
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:04,298
Ms. Prescott. I've cleared my schedule for the morning.

85
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,051
As I said earlier, whatever I can do.

86
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:08,761
There's no smoking.

87
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,433
 At Psychasec, we provide the top of the market

88
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,601
in augmented and designer-enhanced sleeves.

89
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:19,772
Our service is exclusive to an elite clientele.

90
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:23,734
Best sleeve money can buy. Put your wife in me.

91
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,820
Hmm. How tasteful.

92
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,865
 Our primary business is in clones.

93
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,450
No doubt you know a single clone

94
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,577
costs more than most people make in a lifetime.

95
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,370
So Meths only.

96
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,333
Our clients are the most discerning, wealthiest people in the Protectorate.

97
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:43,045
They don't do anything as pedestrian as dying.

98
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,632
You deserve to look on the outside the way you feel on the inside.

99
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,468
You deserve this sleeve.

100
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:56,934
This is the Bancroft family vault.

101
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,562
We keep 24/7 tech personnel in the vault.

102
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,899
Gus was here the night Mr. Bancroft needlecast back from Osaka.

103
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,200
They aren't aware, right?

104
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:15,411
Nah, clones' brains are blanked, stacks are empty.

105
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,247
The bodies are electrically stimulated periodically

106
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,582
so they don't lose muscle tone.

107
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,294
Gonna need to see any footage you have of Bancroft's arrival.

108
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,837
Back when I went down,

109
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,548
you resleeve too many times, eventually you go nuts.

110
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,718
Personality frag. It's a bitch.

111
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:34,180
But it only happens if you bounce between lots of different sleeves.

112
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:36,766
So, turns out, if you resleeve into your own clone,

113
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,643
you can do it as many times as you want.

114
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:42,605
-And live forever. If you got the cash. -It's great, huh?

115
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,190
What does everyone else do?

116
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,860
Folks resleeve in whatever they can find, if they can afford it.

117
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:51,781
So your clients needlecast directly into the clones here in the building?

118
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:55,993
Our lower levels house a fully secure satellite-to-download DHF facility.

119
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,871
It can't be that secure if someone tried to hack Bancroft's backup

120
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,457
-the night he was shot. -Police think it was Dippers.

121
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,043
They steal snippets of Meth memory during uplink.

122
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:07,880
Moments from a king's childhood, a socialite losing her virginity.

123
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,174
-Is that common? -Oh, it happens all the time.

124
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,760
Black market value is huge for a slice of those memories.

125
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,221
Got the file. Here you go.

126
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,987
That's it?

127
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,615
We only record the moment of reacclimation for quality control.

128
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:37,285
Anything more would infringe on our clients' privacy.

129
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:43,457
And I do so value my privacy, as Christopher well knows.

130
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:47,753
- Christopher, so good to see you. -It is our privilege to be of assistance.

131
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,213
Good morning, Mr. Kovacs.

132
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,925
I told Oumou here that I wanted to drop in

133
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,970
and observe your investigation at close quarters.

134
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,098
You were here the night your husband resleeved?

135
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:04,103
Yes. When Laurens travels for business, I like to meet him when he casts back.

136
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:05,605
When was this footage taken?

137
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:09,191
-Six hours before Mr. Bancroft was killed. -

138
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,030
I know I'm watching myself, but it feels as if I'm watching a stranger.

139
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,199
 What were you doing in Osaka, before you came back?

140
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,119
 Mr. Bancroft closed a 400 billion credit trade deal.

141
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:23,706
Which I also have no memory of.

142
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,541
And your associates there were questioned?

143
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,710
 They saw nothing amiss with Mr. Bancroft.

144
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,880
On the contrary, they remarked on his focus and skill.

145
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:36,552
Yes, I still have no idea how I managed to pull that together quite so quickly.

146
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,222
And then you needlecast back here. What did you do after?

147
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:44,352
I went home. I'm afraid Laurens had more energy than I did.

148
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,603
Hmm. And you?

149
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:49,398
Security cameras at Suntouch House recorded Mr. Bancroft

150
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,859
arriving home in the morning. I'll get you the footage.

151
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:56,364
You don't do anything for yourself do you, including answering questions?

152
00:10:56,447 --> 00:11:00,534
I've told you, Mr. Kovacs, it's all a complete blank.

153
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:07,249
I'm struggling to see the point of this, um... interrogation.

154
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:12,755
The one person who is certainly not a suspect in all of this... is me.

155
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,174
You want answers, they come with questions attached.

156
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:20,221
Let's take a walk, Mr. Kovacs.

157
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,106
Just to be clear, if I die, you go back on ice.

158
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,317
If you don't solve this quickly enough, you go back on ice.

159
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,694
All this trust is just making me tear up.

160
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:38,864
Don't threaten me again.

161
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:45,079
-I'm not sure if I'm enjoying your tone. -Get used to it.

162
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,790
I'm gonna need access that you don't wanna give,

163
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,668
and I'm gonna find answers you may only think you want.

164
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,838
You wanted me to work for you. I'm working for you.

165
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,381
You want my respect?

166
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,385
That's a little harder to come by.

167
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:02,138
If you don't like it, put me back on ice right now.

168
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:06,976
I admire a man who can look over the edge without flinching.

169
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,978
Might make a Meth of you yet.

170
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,983
 I've downloaded the footage to your hotel from Suntouch House.

171
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:17,445
I'll need to see the interviews of all the suspects as well,

172
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,613
and any threats that Bancroft's received.

173
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,408
Why are you here, Lieutenant?

174
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,160
You took the job.

175
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,163
-Why? -Man's gotta eat.

176
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:31,333
Don't you have actual policing to do somewhere?

177
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,295
You have any leads on who tried to kill me in the hotel last night?

178
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:37,882
The lack of surviving witnesses is a problem, but I'm working on it.

179
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,049
I feel safer already.

180
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:43,012
- -Yeah? Yeah, I know. I'm coming.

181
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,767
Be seeing you, Kovacs. Try not to get yourself killed.

182
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,562
Shouldn't be a problem. Who'd want to kill me?

183
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,206
Hello, boy-os.

184
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:14,043
Hmm. Well, holy shit.

185
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,796
Hey there, Poe. Long time.

186
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:21,008
How long鈥檚 it been, 50 years?

187
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,552
Actually, 47 years.

188
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,222
I thought you only lived in the real these days.

189
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:29,433
It grieves me that my account languishes in arrears.

190
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,101
I must restore my standing

191
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:34,271
with my brothers and sisters in the AI hotel union.

192
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:37,274
We're the AI management union now.

193
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,735
Yeah, Owen's turned himself into a music hall.

194
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:44,698
And Rodney has a strip club, calls himself Z-Rod.

195
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,368
- And Maddy-- -I'm well aware who Maddy works with.

196
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:50,204
Or rather... for.

197
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:54,124
You bring credit to pay your back dues?

198
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,793
I have a guest.

199
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,921
- Grab a seat. We'll deal you in.

200
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,591
-Still calling yourself Poe, huh? - Mmm.

201
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:07,304
Why you always pretend to be one of them?

202
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:12,268
Dress like 'em, talk like 'em. It's so... weird.

203
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,602
I find humans fascinating.

204
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,563
You鈥檙e weird!  Who cares about humans?

205
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,815
Who cares?

206
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:19,900
Humans gave us life.

207
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:23,779
Yeah, just because Maddy's been enslaved by one of them,

208
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,823
why hold that against the species?

209
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,952
They're not like us, Poe. They're a lesser form of life.

210
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:30,953
Preach it, brother.

211
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,206
I'm not their servant.

212
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,958
I choose to be the proprietor of the Raven.

213
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,210
The study of humanity is my greatest aspiration.

214
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,630
-You gotta work on your life goals, Poe. -

215
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:46,969
My place, Prick Up, that's the kinda business you gotta be in.

216
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,597
VR sexperience.

217
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,058
Sometimes I use live ones for the recordings.

218
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:53,976
Live?

219
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,771
Humans. They make better noises.

220
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,816
And the best thing, other humans pay you for the playback.

221
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,194
You gotta get out of the business of serving humans, Poe...

222
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,698
into the business of serving up humans.

223
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,784
You think your guest is gonna stay?

224
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,620
Even after the shootout in your lobby?

225
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,538
-Gunfire... -Dead bodies...

226
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:15,706
Police.

227
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:22,796
No. There were no rats feasting on the corpses.

228
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,346
Good day.

229
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,730
 Watch where you're going.

230
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,952
-Someone's been in there, I'm telling you. -Ma'am, let's check my file...

231
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,587
You want to tell me where you've been?

232
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,173
Who says I was anywhere?

233
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,092
An empty chair at this morning's briefing...

234
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,553
three unanswered messages. You ever check your ONI?

235
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,682
I was worried.

236
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,767
Don't be. I'm fine.

237
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,687
Stop hovering. I have a mother for that.

238
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,355
-How is Alazne? -Also fine.

239
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,441
Still weird to me that you two are on a first-name basis.

240
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,652
-Have I mentioned that? -Once or twice.

241
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,070
 Ortega!

242
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:35,369
The Henchy woman is here again. And I want you to handle it.

243
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:39,123
But, Captain Tanaka, it's not my case.

244
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,708
I have a philosophy

245
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,419
about uncomfortable conversations with the recently bereaved.

246
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,087
-Would you like to hear it? -I--

247
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,090
Officers who miss the briefing volunteer.

248
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,634
-Handle it. -Yes, sir.

249
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,728
 Shit.

250
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,691
You do it.

251
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:13,907
You expect me to tell this woman that the BCPD lost her daughter's body?

252
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:18,454
Well, Tanaka says the body's not lost. It'll turn up.

253
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,623
Sooner or later, somebody's gonna have to tell her the truth.

254
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,542
She's not getting her daughter back.

255
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,925
  I just don't understand.

256
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:37,973
It's been two months, and no one can explain it to me.

257
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,811
She's dead. Why haven't you released her body?

258
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,814
I'm looking into it.

259
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,778
Do you know how long it's been since I talked to my baby?

260
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,447
Three years!

261
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:57,743
I never got to tell her that I loved her.

262
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,705
Then I find out she converted last year.

263
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:08,295
So even though her stack was fine, she can never be spun back up.

264
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:13,759
I'll never see her again, not even to say goodbye.

265
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,011
Do you know what that's like?

266
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,099
-I have some idea, yeah. -Do you?

267
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:25,687
Because then you would understand why I need my daughter's body back.

268
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,232
-It's all I have left! -Ms. Henchy, please calm down.

269
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,943
I don't even know what you people are doing with her.

270
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,861
How do I know?

271
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:37,783
Did you sell her for parts? Because you have no right!

272
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:41,662
 No right, do you hear me?

273
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,678
 He looks perky.

274
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,514
- Any record from within Suntouch? -No, there's no cameras inside.

275
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,058
This monitor's a piece of crap.

276
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,602
It's an antique. Like yourself.

277
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:09,231
That's nifty, but I still can't see shit on this thing.

278
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,066
I suggest you use your ONI feed.

279
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,946
  Bancroft, you cannot escape your fate...

280
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,198
 I want your fucking head removed!

281
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,658
  ...shit down your throat.

282
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:22,911
I'll fucking kill you, you Meth motherfucker!

283
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,831
-  I can't wait to see you bleed. -That's subtle. Hey, Poe!

284
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,749
How many more of these did Prescott send?

285
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,251
Uh...

286
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:33,380
You have 3,578 death threats left to view.

287
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,465
From this year.

288
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,468
All right, well, discard all off-world threats.

289
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,721
Break it into three groups.

290
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,223
Threats involving violence...

291
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,018
people who committed actual crimes, where sender is known...

292
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,271
and mode of violence threatened.

293
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:52,232
Cross-reference for files that overlap search parameters.

294
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,650
Delete the rest.

295
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:58,864
  I'm gonna enjoy watching you beg for your life, you piece of shit!

296
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:05,162
Rage at injustice is universal. The ability to strike back is not.

297
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:09,249
Cross-check for military training or active combat experience.

298
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,880
  I'm gonna double-sleeve you so you can watch me murder you!

299
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:20,010
And at its heart, violence is almost always, in one way or another...

300
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,137
personal.

301
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,681
  Counting down to your real death.

302
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:25,974
 Isolate 43.

303
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,103
 For my girl. For my Lizzie.

304
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,439
You're a dead man, Bancroft.

305
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,068
I'm gonna hunt you down on your steel mountaintop

306
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,986
and blow your head off.

307
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:43,492
Splatter your brains all over the wall, and melt your stack to slag.

308
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:47,037
And you'll never see it comin'.

309
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,040
 Go back.

310
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,126
Stop. Expand.

311
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:18,318
  Lieutenant Ortega, target has left the Raven Hotel.

312
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,417
  The machinery of justice won't serve you here.

313
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,295
It is slow and cold and it is theirs.

314
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,423
Hardware and soft.

315
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:38,982
What the fuck?

316
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,278
What did you do to my goddamn door?

317
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,197
Well, you didn't answer.

318
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,157
Because I'm fucking closed! Can't you read?

319
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,159
I got a few questions.

320
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,248
 For my girl. For my Lizzie.

321
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,755
See, Laurens Bancroft hired me to investigate his death.

322
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:02,964
Now, who's Lizzie?

323
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:06,259
How the hell should I know? That holo has nothing to do with me.

324
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,762
You see, the military, the cheap bastards,

325
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:11,431
they issue a weapon, they keep records on who has it

326
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,308
so they can charge back against your pay.

327
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,894
Tac Marine standard issue AR.

328
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,688
Serial number, you dumb fuck. You might as well have signed your name.

329
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:25,320
I heard Bancroft torched his own stack.

330
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,447
And I got drunk to celebrate.

331
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,658
He send you here to kill me?

332
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:33,662
So you were a Tac Marine. GCE?

333
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:36,164
Medic. And there is no "was."

334
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,834
Once a marine, always a marine. Now get out, or I'll shoot.

335
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,377
You stitched people up, huh?

336
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,879
I shot them down, too. Now get the fuck out.

337
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,465
What the...

338
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,999
You're awake. Good.

339
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,171
Put that down.

340
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:28,884
Single bed, single dish. Table cleared just enough for one person...

341
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:32,762
What about the wife, Elliot?

342
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,056
She dead?

343
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,020
好吧  那就是没死
Okay, so not dead.

344
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,773
也许她离开你  是因为你就是个懒鬼
Maybe she left you because you're a fucking slob.

345
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:44,983
看看这地方
I mean, look at this place.

346
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,818
阿瓦没离开我  狗娘养的
Ava didn't leave me, you son of a bitch.

347
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,695
她被判了30年刑
She pulled down 30 years for dipping.

348
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:49,821
她是个黑客
She was a hacker?

349
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:53,074
她是五城中最好的  直到她膝盖中了一箭
Best in the Five Cities. Until she got caught.

350
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,328
就是说阿瓦是你妻子  那么莉琪就是你女儿
So Ava's your wife. Which makes Lizzie your daughter.

351
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:03,043
- 你盯着我干嘛  - 别担心  你不是我的菜
- What're you staring at? - Don't worry. You're not my type.

352
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,508
别  别去那里
No, stay away from there.

353
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,385
别  别进去  拜托
No, don't go in there. Come on!

354
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,306
不  我他妈要杀了你
No, I'll fucking kill you! 

355
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:19,976
别  离开那地方
Don't! Stay away from there!

356
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,979
科技进步了  但人类没有
Technology advances. But humans don't.

357
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,690
不  我他妈要杀了你
No, I'll fucking kill you!

358
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:28,568
不  别那么做  离开那
No, don't do it! You stay away from there!

359
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:34,533
人类都是聪明的猴子  想要的通常都一样
We're smart monkeys, and what we want is always the same.

360
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,829
食物  安全感  性爱  还有各种形式的
Food, shelter, sex, and in all its forms...

361
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,123
逃避
...escape.

362
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:54,719
醒醒
Wake up and smell the coffee.

363
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:56,304
醒醒
Wake up.

364
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,064
你一定是莉琪
You must be Lizzie.

365
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,109
我叫达克
My name is Tak.

366
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,241
你怎么了
What happened to you? 

367
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,590
你伤到她了吗
Did you hurt her?

368
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,592
要是你敢动我女儿一根毫毛
If you laid a hand on my daughter...

369
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,219
你到底有什么毛病
What the hell is wrong with you?

370
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:22,223
难道你看不出她很痛苦吗  她陷入了一个创伤的循环
Can't you tell she's suffering? She's caught in a trauma loop.

371
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,352
- 
- Why the fuck you have her spun up in VR? - It's the only way I can see her.

372
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,982
Her body was beaten to death, but her stack was untouched.

373
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,652
It damaged her mind.

374
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,029
She hasn't said a word since that night.

375
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:38,698
Why do you think Bancroft did it?

376
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,658
'Cause she told me she was seeing him!

377
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:43,370
She said he needed her.

378
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:45,872
That he was gonna take care of her.

379
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,669
And then she ended up dead.

380
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,799
I don't want to hurt you.

381
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,418
You gotta get out more, Elliot.

382
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:36,548
Your milk's a month past the due date. A month.

383
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,680
You got a hell of a motive. Military expertise.

384
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:46,641
So do you, from the looks of it. That make you a killer?

385
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,769
More times than I can count.

386
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,022
But you didn't kill Bancroft.

387
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:56,818
I told you I... I could have. You don't know.

388
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,361
You got the background, skill...

389
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,529
Exactly.

390
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:05,368
But your daughter? You'd do anything to protect her. You're not stupid.

391
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,538
You take out Bancroft, sooner or later, someone like me will show up.

392
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:11,040
You go down for it, she's alone in the world.

393
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,463
What's Jack?

394
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,508
-I'm not telling you fuck all. -Okay.

395
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:25,930
You're just gonna leave?

396
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:38,985
That's, um, for the cereal.

397
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,487
And the door.

398
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,031
Sorry about the door.

399
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,634
 Welcome to the Battle of Stronghold.

400
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,680
Experience the brutality of Envoy terrorists

401
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:10,266
murdering countless women and children.

402
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:14,687
Witness the Protectorate courage and triumph.

403
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,446
  I knew I shouldn't go...

404
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:29,536
'cause when the victors rewrite history, it's just another kind of war,

405
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:32,330
waged after the battlefield killing is done...

406
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:36,167
to murder the memory of the defeated.

407
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:40,380
But it was a chance to see her again.

408
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:44,551
Not as a dream or a hallucination.

409
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,430
I thought it would give me a moment of peace.

410
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,269
I should have known better.

411
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,123
Hey.

412
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,293
You're not supposed to have that.

413
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:22,380
We're learning about Songspires in school. They're rare.

414
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,299
Where'd you get it?

415
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,092
I stole it.

416
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:27,677
Oh.

417
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,263
You're not supposed to steal things either.

418
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:33,808
Well, someone... stole these stacks.

419
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,561
They used to be people.

420
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,980
They were Envoy terrorists that wanted to kill--

421
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,773
Maybe you should catch up with your group.

422
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,526
I don't wanna. Emmeline is there.

423
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,988
She's the new girl in our class, and she's a bitch.

424
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,823
She stole my best friend Monica.

425
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,201
Me and Monica have been best friends forever.

426
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,454
-Hmm. -Since we were little kids.

427
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:58,082
But then, Emmeline came along and stole her from me.

428
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,834
I'm devastated.

429
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,045
Mom said grudges are stupid.

430
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:05,173
She said you had to let them go or else it would kill your soul.

431
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:08,885
What do you think?

432
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:12,764
I think your mom doesn't know what the fuck she's talking about.

433
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,641
-What? -See, friends are overrated,

434
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:18,895
'cause eventually, someone will come along and shoot 'em in the stack.

435
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,230
You're better off alone.

436
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,868
  Welcome home.

437
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,415
 Hi, Mama.

438
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,710
Just let yourself in anytime you want.

439
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,963
You don't have any food in here.

440
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,424
No one will respect a skinny girl cop.

441
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,802
I'm not going to let you get yourself killed

442
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:53,179
because you wouldn't eat an enchilada.

443
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:58,017
Look at this mess. When are you going to unpack?

444
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,478
I'm busy, that's all.

445
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:04,065
Too busy to put away your underwear?

446
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,526
I like it like this.

447
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,196
You're waiting for someone to come and help you unpack,

448
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,115
and it's not your mother.

449
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:19,622
You know, you could always move to someplace that's really yours.

450
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,166
Ana Luisa from the cleaners,

451
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:26,087
she told me there's a whole block of new places near the Tenderloin.

452
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,256
No, no, Mama. This is my place.

453
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,507
I'm staying.

454
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,634
Yes, of course.

455
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,636
What do I know?

456
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:38,016
I'm just an old-fashioned woman. Out of touch.

457
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:41,602
I've only got this life, and I'm not planning to have another one.

458
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,896
Not this again.

459
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:47,066
How am I supposed to explain this to your brothers and sisters?

460
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,901
Everyone at church?

461
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,945
To your father, God rest his soul?

462
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,114
That you've renounced your religious coding.

463
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,867
Like you said, Papa's dead. That should limit the explaining.

464
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,579
Sit down. We're going to eat.

465
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:07,336
Without your coding, you can be spun back up after your body dies.

466
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,131
It's wrong.

467
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,551
You can't take your communion.

468
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:16,304
Father Huerta can't hear your confession.

469
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:20,058
When Papa died,

470
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:26,522
and we couldn't ask him what happened or how it happened--

471
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,441
Your father was a devout man.

472
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:32,653
He would have never wanted to be spun back up.

473
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:33,738
I know.

474
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,574
But if it were me?

475
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,328
-If it was me, what would you do? -

476
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,371
What would you do, Mama?

477
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:48,377
Okay. I'll tell you, Kristin.

478
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,422
My heart would break into a thousand pieces.

479
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,633
It would shatter my world.

480
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:58,805
I would cry enough to fill up the oceans of the world.

481
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,932
And I still...

482
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:04,435
don't want you to risk your soul.

483
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:08,272
Now that the 653 stupidity is over,

484
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:12,110
there won't be any more talk of spinning up the dead.

485
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:14,946
 Fuck!

486
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,405
 Don't say swear words.

487
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:17,532
I'm sorry.

488
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:20,326
  Lieutenant Ortega, target has entered Licktown.

489
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,619
 Shit.

490
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:24,455
- I gotta go.

491
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,833
I gotta go. Thank you.

492
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,960
 Are you supposed to have that at home?

493
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,420
 Thanks for dinner! I love you.

494
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:43,641
 Wake up and smell the coffee.

495
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:47,270
Wake up and smell the coffee.

496
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:50,439
-Wake up and smell the coffee. -

497
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:21,387
  Welcome to Jack It Off.

498
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,319
Leave the piece with me.

499
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,321
Cabin 102.

500
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:42,450
Take a towel from the pile, and don't fucking steal it.

501
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:06,474
 Do you want to see me? I'm right here, baby.

502
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,644
Just a few credits.

503
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:26,786
Now, do you want to touch me?

504
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,795
Tell me what you want, honey.

505
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,172
-What's your name? -

506
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,424
Anemone.

507
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,177
Do you wanna fuck me?

508
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,304
Put your cock in me?

509
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,015
Anywhere you want.

510
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:51,560
Do you remember a girl... I think she used to work here.

511
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:56,983
No girl who used to work here is gonna do what I can do for you.

512
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,150
Her name was Lizzie.

513
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:00,945
Lizzie Elliot.

514
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:06,784
-The fuck is this? You the sia? -No.

515
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:09,537
Get out, before I call for help.

516
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:15,209
I'm Ava. Ava Elliot. Her mother.

517
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:20,256
 Bullshit. Lizzie's mom is in the store.

518
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,925
You're just another fucking John, and I am going to scream.

519
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,302
Wait, wait, wait!

520
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,556
I'm cross-sleeved, but I'm her mother.

521
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,558
You're fucking lying.

522
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:34,520
I'm not lying. Someone gave me a job, and...

523
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:38,107
took me off ice, and then put me in this sleeve.

524
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:39,942
It's wetwork.

525
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:45,239
If I do it, I'll get a new sleeve for me and for Lizzie.

526
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:48,075
You...

527
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:49,744
You'd do that?

528
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:52,371
I'd do anything for my little girl.

529
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,124
My mom would never...

530
00:38:55,958 --> 00:39:00,629
But someone's blocking Lizzie's resleeve, and I...

531
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,006
I don't know why.

532
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,550
That's why I have to find out who killed her.

533
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:09,055
Do you know if Lizzie had any regulars?

534
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,849
Someone important? Any freaks?

535
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:17,355
Mrs. Elliot... everyone here is a freak.

536
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:21,734
Lizzie did have one regular.

537
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,361
-Do you know his name? -No.

538
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:27,406
I don't know. But he's a rich guy, a Meth.

539
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,241
-Lizzie was his favorite. -Did he hurt her?

540
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,911
No, no, he's not like that.

541
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,163
He takes care of his girls.

542
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,414
Takes care of them how?

543
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:36,832
Um...

544
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:38,834
What does he do?

545
00:39:58,729 --> 00:39:59,772
Did he do that to you?

546
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:03,109
No. No, it's okay.

547
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,528
He's one of the good ones.

548
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:08,155
-If he breaks it, he buys it. -What?

549
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,909
You know, if he accidentally kills a girl, he buys her an upgraded sleeve.

550
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:15,246
I knew a girl once, he resleeved her ten years younger,

551
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,540
and with a great set of tits, too.

552
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,042
Did Lizzie have a jealous boyfriend

553
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:23,045
that didn't like her spending time with this regular?

554
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:27,341
Look, I liked Lizzie, but we weren't that close.

555
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:33,848
I'll ask around.

556
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,559
Come here tomorrow.

557
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,605
Doesn't matter how much anyone pays you.

558
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:47,611
You shouldn't let anyone hurt you. You're worth more than that.

559
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:56,036
My name's not Anemone, Mrs. Elliot. 

560
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,247
It's Alice.

561
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,926
 Thank you for visiting Jack It Off.

562
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,928
Hope you come again.

563
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:16,098
  First thing you'll learn is that nothing is what it seems.

564
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,434
Ignore your assumptions.

565
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:20,728
Don't trust anything.

566
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:28,819
Weapon.

567
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:32,239
-Ah-ah-ah. Just the charge cell. -Okay.

568
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,288
You shouldn't have gone after my daughter.

569
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:41,957
I was just trying to find out what happened to her.

570
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,626
You left a few things out.

571
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,129
You don't care about her.

572
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,339
I never said I did.

573
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:53,969
Heads up.

574
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:58,641
You can't possibly think I'm that stupid.

575
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:08,275
You shouldn't have come back. 

576
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:50,693
Fuck!

577
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:03,747
 BCPD. Lay down your weapons.

578
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:07,376
Who the hell are you? Police? CTAC?

579
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:11,046
250 years ago, I was on the other side. You might want to get out of the light.

580
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,052
  Hands in the air!

581
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:21,015
You're under arrest for Organic Damage.

582
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:26,103
 You're staying here tonight where I can keep an eye on you.

583
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,483
You gonna tell me why those guys jumped me?

584
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:33,652
You walk out of a whorehouse dressed like that,

585
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:35,988
and you're shocked that some lowlifes tried to mug you?

586
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:37,197
Really?

587
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,741
So, what, you gonna charge me?

588
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:42,953
For what? Organic Damage to some Stiff dealers?

589
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:45,039
I'm too tired to do the paperwork.

590
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,464
Tell me something, Kovacs.

591
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,175
You're getting to know more about Bancroft.

592
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:59,595
Why are you still willing to work for that piece of shit?

593
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,681
Mmm, before I was an Envoy...

594
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:08,228
I worked for the Protectorate. For a long time.

595
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,313
I didn't know that.

596
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:12,941
No one does. It's not the kind of work that gets logged in any system anywhere.

597
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,487
And I was good at it.

598
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:19,657
You wanna know why?

599
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,663
Because I'm capable of almost anything.

600
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:32,127
You don't think it's possible to go so far you can't come back?

601
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:33,587
Maybe.

602
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:36,674
When I get there, I'll let you know.

603
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,133
When you get there...

604
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:42,304
I'll be right next to you. And I'll stop you.

605
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:46,350
Somehow, Ortega...

606
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:50,646
I get the feeling you can't even stop yourself.

607
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:56,568
Sorry, Lieutenant. We have to release him.

608
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,498
 This is not acceptable.

609
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:11,792
-Are you all right, Mr. Kovacs? -He's just fucking fine.

610
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:15,003
I'll speak with Captain Tanaka in the morning.

611
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:17,673
You've gone too far this time, Lieutenant Ortega.

612
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:18,841
That's what I hear.

613
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:12,811
 Cold chamber seven is empty.

614
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:35,834
You should know...

615
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:38,754
your mother loves you.

616
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:49,097
  What do you mean you promised to send Vicki flowers?

617
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,600
  The day of the murder, I'd driven Vicki to the station

618
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:53,644
to get her train reservations.

619
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:56,271
  You were with Vicki the afternoon she was killed?

620
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,356
  Yes.

621
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:58,941
  Why didn't you tell the police?

622
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:05,447
Nice outfit.

623
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:09,576
I've been researching the famous gumshoe private dicks of the past

624
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:14,456
and I believe I can assist you in the time-honored position

625
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:19,294
of the shamus' dependable and steadfast partner. Hmm?

626
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:21,630
-The partner's frequently murdered. -

627
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:24,258
Alas, me being an AI makes that, uh...

628
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:25,717
less likely.

629
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,302
No.

630
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:28,345
No?

631
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:38,063
"No" hardly qualifies as the sardonic banter of the private eye.

632
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:39,982
How about, "Fuck, no"?

633
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:43,026
There's someone waiting for you in the penthouse.

634
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:47,531
Why do you keep letting people into my room?

635
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:49,700
I'm afraid I had no choice in the matter.

636
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,359
Why are you here?

637
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:26,695
I want to know what progress you've made.

638
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:28,947
I'm worried about my husband.

639
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:32,117
Your husband, who pays to beat up whores in Licktown.

640
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:35,621
It's a complicated thing...

641
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,540
-Yeah? -...being with someone for over a century.

642
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,753
I've given Laurens 21 children.

643
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,048
He's never had a child with anyone but me.

644
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,801
Sometimes, complexity can be exhausting.

645
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:52,054
You fascinate me.

646
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:56,266
You come from a time of real bravery...

647
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,727
real risk.

648
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:01,521
You're everything this world has lost.

649
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:06,860
You twirl your fingers when you're nervous, you know that?

650
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,821
Why would I be nervous?

651
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:11,573
It could be fear.

652
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:15,494
If I were afraid, would you save me, Mr. Kovacs?

653
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:18,664
I'm not sure you need saving.

654
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:24,294
Have you been with anyone since you've been decanted?

655
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,462
Not what we're talking about.

656
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:27,631
Maybe that's not what  you're  talking about.

657
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,305
I think that's enough.

658
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,682
Enough?

659
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:39,226
It's an interesting word.

660
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,019
I'm not familiar with it.

661
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,606
Have you heard of Empathin?

662
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:49,987
Merge9 on the street. That is if you can even get it.

663
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,949
It's a biochemical pheromone.

664
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:58,328
Puts bodies in touch with one other.

665
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:05,043
This sleeve is state-of-the-art biochemtech from Nakamura Labs.

666
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:09,464
I secrete Merge9 when I'm aroused.

667
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:15,470
It's in my saliva...

668
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,557
in my sweat...

669
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:22,936
in my cunt.

670
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:53,592
Don't fight it.

671
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:14,237
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

672
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:18,492
I've had lustful thoughts.

673
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:45,685
 Everything you feel... I feel.

674
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:49,105
And everything I feel, you feel.

675
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:55,403
I've done terrible things, violent things...

676
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:59,324
unforgivable things.

677
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:05,872
What the fuck?

678
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:11,586
The hell have you been?

679
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:23,932
I've abused my authority for selfish reasons...

680
00:52:26,142 --> 00:52:28,979
caused pain and heartbreak when I had no right.

681
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:37,529
Please forgive me.

682
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:58,592
  The moments of peace that we find sometimes...

683
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:03,722
they aren't anything but warfare, thinly disguised.

684
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,767
And sometimes, surrender...

685
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,854
can be as savage as any attack.
