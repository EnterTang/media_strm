1
00:00:48,585 --> 00:00:50,246
好了，他们来了。
开
All right, they're here.
Let's do this.

2
00:00:50,287 --> 00:00:52,016
等等，别的客人呢？
Wait wait, what about
the other guests?

3
00:00:52,055 --> 00:00:54,148
什么别的客人？
大家都在这了
What other guests?
Everyone's here.

4
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,920
-抵押贷款文件呢？
-在这呢
- Do you have the mortgage?
- Yeah, here we go.

5
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,724
我等这一刻30年了
I've been waiting
30 years to do this.

6
00:01:04,734 --> 00:01:06,702
-来吧
-来了
- There you go.
- There we go.

7
00:01:06,736 --> 00:01:10,035
-哦呜
-哦
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

8
00:01:10,073 --> 00:01:12,041
-
-S
- Yeah.
- Yay.

9
00:01:13,743 --> 00:01:16,439
房子付清了
The house is now
paid off.

10
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,447
敬给Lynbrook抵押贷款公司
可爱的工作人员
Here's to the wonderful
people

11
00:01:18,481 --> 00:01:21,279
谢谢日历
at Lynbrook Mortgage.
Thanks for the calendars,

12
00:01:21,318 --> 00:01:24,685
你们都可以来亲我的
美国大屁股了
and you can all kiss
my great American ass.

13
00:01:25,889 --> 00:01:27,356
爷爷，爷爷
Grandpa, Grandpa.

14
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,188
哦，对不起，孩子们。
不要说屁股
Oh, oh, sorry, kids.
Don't say ass.

15
00:01:31,594 --> 00:01:33,789
嘿，真好玩
Hey, that was fun.

16
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,821
-
-让我们开个真正的派对
- Yeah!
- Let's have a real party.

17
00:01:35,865 --> 00:01:37,992
玛丽，把咱们的结婚证拿过来
Marie, go get
our marriage license.

18
00:01:39,179 --> 00:01:41,443
好了，可以吃了吗，请问？
All right,
could we eat, please?

19
00:01:41,481 --> 00:01:44,382
-过来，孩子们
-妈，爸，恭喜了
- Come on, kids.
- Ma, Dad, congratulations.

20
00:01:44,417 --> 00:01:46,385
房子已经是你们的产业的一部分
The house becomes
part of your estate

21
00:01:46,419 --> 00:01:48,683
要在以前欧洲，
which in the old country
would be

22
00:01:48,722 --> 00:01:52,214
将传给长子
passed down
to the firstborn son.

23
00:01:52,258 --> 00:01:55,489
要在以前欧洲，
你早进马戏团了
In the old country,
you'd be working in the circus.

24
00:01:58,431 --> 00:02:00,797
猴子服（礼服）可以脱了
Monkey suit's
coming off.

25
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:03,428
那么，玛丽，怎么了？
So, Marie,
what happened?

26
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,030
我以为你们要开个大型派对庆祝
I thought you were gonna have
a big party to celebrate.

27
00:02:06,072 --> 00:02:08,040
这就是派对。
我做了烤面包
It is a party.
I made bruschetta.

28
00:02:08,074 --> 00:02:10,372
哦，我以为你说
Oh, I thought
when you said

29
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,435
要开个派对指的是
you were having a party
that would include...

30
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,447
我不知道……有朋友参加的那种
I don't know...
some friends.

31
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:17,450
哦，谁有时间交朋友？
来个魔鬼蛋吧，亲爱的
Oh, who has time for friends?
Have a deviled egg, dear.

32
00:02:19,486 --> 00:02:21,852
什么叫做你没时间交朋友？
What do you mean,
you don't have time for friends?

33
00:02:21,888 --> 00:02:23,856
你和雷蒙德搬过来以后
Well, after you and
Raymond moved in,

34
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,326
我是说，总得有人帮你照顾家里吧
I mean, someone had to help you
raise a family,

35
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,420
所以我们只能牺牲些东西
so we just had
to give up some things.

36
00:02:30,463 --> 00:02:32,693
你的社交生活
Your social life?

37
00:02:32,732 --> 00:02:34,427
我们仍然有社交生活的
We still have
a social life.

38
00:02:37,704 --> 00:02:40,468
吗，罗伯特把魔鬼蛋全吃了
Ma, Robert's eating
all the deviled eggs,

39
00:02:40,507 --> 00:02:42,634
他都不给我一个
won't give me any.

40
00:02:42,675 --> 00:02:45,200
马戏团里从不让人吃饱饭
They don't feed us enough
in the circus.

41
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,246
嘿，爸爸是不是给杰弗里喝酒了？
Hey, did my father give Geoffrey
some wine today?

42
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,649
不，为什么？
No, why?

43
00:03:00,693 --> 00:03:02,718
我抱他上床的时候，
他来一句
'Cause I was putting him
to bed, and he said,

44
00:03:02,762 --> 00:03:04,753
“我爱你，兄弟”
"I love you, man. "

45
00:03:09,903 --> 00:03:12,963
也许，你也该来点酒
Perhaps you would like
some wine.

46
00:03:13,006 --> 00:03:14,974
嘿，听着
Hey, listen,

47
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:17,033
你知道你妈在那个派对上
跟我说什么了？
you know what your mom
told me at that party?

48
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:19,238
他们完全没朋友
They don't have
any friends.

49
00:03:20,747 --> 00:03:23,807
你好像很吃惊
You sound surprised.

50
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,341
感觉有点悲哀
Well, it's kind of sad.
It's kind of sad.

51
00:03:26,386 --> 00:03:28,616
对可能会成为他们朋友的人来说
Well, it's not sad
for the people

52
00:03:28,655 --> 00:03:30,646
就不是悲哀了
who would have to be
their friends.

53
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:35,587
除了我们不得不做他们的朋友
Except we have to be
their friends.

54
00:03:37,263 --> 00:03:40,164
-是有点悲哀
-是的
- That is a little sad.
- Yeah.

55
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,794
看着，我们是他们生活的全部
Look, we're their
whole lives!

56
00:03:42,836 --> 00:03:45,999
我突然明白
如果他们的朋友多一些
It occurred to me
that if they had more friends,

57
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:48,769
他们也会少和咱们搅和
we'd have less them.

58
00:03:51,211 --> 00:03:53,702
你准备好预算了吗？
Have you worked out
a budget for this?

59
00:03:55,648 --> 00:03:57,639
好吧，别叨叨了
All right, break it up.

60
00:03:57,684 --> 00:04:00,152
哦，你们想要什么？
咱们刚见过面的
Oh, what do you want?
We just saw you.

61
00:04:00,186 --> 00:04:03,280
我们只是给你们带点剩下的食物
We just brought you
some leftovers.

62
00:04:03,323 --> 00:04:05,757
剩下的东西
They don't qualify
as leftovers

63
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:08,488
还是热的？
if they're still warm.

64
00:04:08,528 --> 00:04:10,928
咱们来看点精彩场面
Let's watch some highlights.

65
00:04:10,964 --> 00:04:12,898
弗兰克，你看过这比赛了
Frank, you already
watched this game.

66
00:04:12,932 --> 00:04:16,299
这样我就知道什么地方会精彩了
So I know how good
the highlights will be.

67
00:04:16,336 --> 00:04:19,464
别因为说话把这破坏了
Let's not ruin these
by talking.

68
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,908
啊哼，那么
Ahem, so,

69
00:04:22,942 --> 00:04:26,434
天，玛丽，
得到房子的所有权
gosh, Marie,
it must feel so liberating

70
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,379
-一定感觉非常解放吧？
-是的
- to own the house now, huh?
- Yeah.

71
00:04:28,414 --> 00:04:30,405
想象你们有多少事情可以做了
Think of all the things
you can do now,

72
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,714
比如，喔，可以多请请客
like, gosh, you could
entertain more.

73
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:34,720
我们刚办了派对
We just had a party.

74
00:04:34,754 --> 00:04:36,745
我们干什么的，
54号音乐工作室（1977-1986年曼哈顿一家传奇迪厅，
后1997年拉斯维加斯开了一家同名的俱乐部）？
What are we,
Studio 54?

75
00:04:39,392 --> 00:04:42,418
不，说真的，
你们应该有自己的社交生活
No, really, you deserve
your own social life.

76
00:04:42,462 --> 00:04:45,659
特别是现在房债都还清了
Especially now that all your house
obligations are over,

77
00:04:45,698 --> 00:04:48,292
我们这边也能搞得定了
and we seem
to be managing.

78
00:04:48,334 --> 00:04:50,302
现在是你们说
“你好啊，邻居！”
Now might be
the perfect time

79
00:04:50,336 --> 00:04:52,600
的最好时机了
for you to say,
"Hi, neighbor!"

80
00:04:56,376 --> 00:04:59,140
我需要朋友都在这了
I got all the friends
I need right here.

81
00:05:00,246 --> 00:05:02,976
你看到了，黛比拉？
能重新招待客人
You see, Debra?
I would love to start

82
00:05:03,016 --> 00:05:05,610
我当然喜欢了，
但要是客人来了，
entertaining again,
but if we have guests,

83
00:05:05,652 --> 00:05:08,018
这个怎么解决？
what am I supposed
to do with this?

84
00:05:10,056 --> 00:05:12,024
告诉他们你打赌输了，
Tell them
that you lost a bet,

85
00:05:12,058 --> 00:05:14,458
只能再拾掇喂养他一年
and you've got to clean and feed him
for another year.

86
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,568
行了。
我们都知道
Come on.
We all know

87
00:05:22,602 --> 00:05:24,968
弗兰克会很有趣的
that Frank can be
a lot of fun.

88
00:05:25,004 --> 00:05:27,336
嘿，你知道还有谁很有趣吗？
Hey, you know who else
is a lot of fun?

89
00:05:27,373 --> 00:05:30,069
-隔壁的毛尔家
-我喜欢毛尔家
- The Mauers next door.
- I like the Mauers.

90
00:05:30,109 --> 00:05:32,441
不行
No can do.

91
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:35,572
-为什么？
-因为我最近说不定
- Why not?
- Because I may or may not

92
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,482
朝他们中哪个竖中指了
recently have flipped
one of them the bird.

93
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:44,757
怎么了？
他想把垃圾
What?
He was trying

94
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,487
扔咱们垃圾桶里
to put a piece of garbage
in our garbage can.

95
00:05:47,527 --> 00:05:50,018
那也没必要竖中指吧
That's no reason
to flip them a bird.

96
00:05:51,197 --> 00:05:53,165
嘿，我总不能让收垃圾的以为
Hey, I can't have
the garbage man thinking

97
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,861
我染头发了
I dye my hair.

98
00:05:55,902 --> 00:05:57,870
哦，
Oh,

99
00:05:57,904 --> 00:06:00,566
那这些很自然的了？
so then all that
is natural?

100
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:07,179
嘿，你知道谁很不错吗？
Hey, you know
who's cool?

101
00:06:07,213 --> 00:06:09,647
-斯戴普家
-对呀，斯戴普家！
- The Stipes.
- Yes, the Stipes!

102
00:06:09,682 --> 00:06:11,650
-谁？
-你记得……
- Who?
- You remember...

103
00:06:11,684 --> 00:06:13,811
那些老……
友好的人
those old...
nice people

104
00:06:13,853 --> 00:06:16,913
罗伯特第一次搬家时
一块住的人
that Robert lived with
first time he moved out.

105
00:06:16,956 --> 00:06:19,584
他们要是还活着的话，
他们很友善的
If they're still alive,
they're very friendly.

106
00:06:21,461 --> 00:06:23,554
我在五金店碰见过那个老公来的
I ran into the husband
in the hardware store.

107
00:06:23,596 --> 00:06:26,895
-他还算不太讨厌
-看，看来你们
- He's actually not a jerk.
- See? It sounds like you guys

108
00:06:26,933 --> 00:06:29,902
-在一块会玩得很开心的！
-很可能
- would have a blast together!
- You probably would.

109
00:06:29,936 --> 00:06:32,302
怎么招呼他们，斯戴普家的？
But what are we supposed
to do with these Stipes?

110
00:06:32,338 --> 00:06:34,568
我不知道
I don't know,
you could

111
00:06:34,607 --> 00:06:38,737
你可以邀请他们过来
吃晚饭，喝点东西
invite them over
for dinner or drinks.

112
00:06:38,778 --> 00:06:41,269
还可以玩
“猜猜我忘了什么了”
You could play
"Guess What I Forgot. "

113
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:55,827
下棋怎么样？
What about
a board game?

114
00:06:55,862 --> 00:06:58,831
当然，好极了，下棋。
好主意
Yes, yes, a board game.
Great idea.

115
00:06:58,865 --> 00:07:00,730
好主意，黛比拉
That's a good
idea, Debra.

116
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:03,497
弗兰克，我们要有伴了
Frank, we're having
company.

117
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:06,471
他们最好喜欢讲脏话
They better like
swearing.

118
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:13,040
我们该怎么做？
打电话给他们？
What should we do?
Should we call them?

119
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:16,242
越快越好
Only as soon as possible.

120
00:07:16,282 --> 00:07:17,715
你知道谁有他们电话？
You know who has
their number?

121
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,718
罗伯特，他现在就住在你们房子里
Robert, who lives
in your house right now.

122
00:07:19,752 --> 00:07:22,721
哦，我想好了一大堆菜单！
Oh, I have so many
menu ideas!

123
00:07:22,755 --> 00:07:25,155
是啊，我们太兴奋了。
块从椅子上起来，爸
Yeah, we're all very excited.
Out of the chair, Dad.

124
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:27,159
-嘿
-快点
- Hey.
- Come on.

125
00:07:27,193 --> 00:07:29,161
-我想看……
-出去
- I just wanna watch...
- Well, go outside.

126
00:07:29,195 --> 00:07:31,663
吗在外面。
你们就要和新朋友玩了
Mom's outside. You're gonna go play
with your new friends!

127
00:07:31,698 --> 00:07:33,689
他来了。走好
Here he comes.
There you go.

128
00:07:38,004 --> 00:07:40,700

Yeah.

129
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,708
我知道这个舞
I know that dance.

130
00:07:42,742 --> 00:07:45,905
这是“我想和雷嘿咻”的舞
That's the I-wanna-
have-sex-with-Ray dance.

131
00:07:45,945 --> 00:07:47,913
这个是我
And here's my

132
00:07:47,947 --> 00:07:49,915
“如果你坚持”的舞
if-you-insist dance.

133
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:52,908
你这是在……
别笑
What are you...
don't laugh.

134
00:07:55,288 --> 00:07:57,256
嗯
Mmm.

135
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,814
真好。
感觉在约会
This is fun.
This is like a date.

136
00:07:58,858 --> 00:08:02,316
是啊，除了约会的时候
你从来没到过第二阶段
Yeah, except on a date
you never got to level two.

137
00:08:02,362 --> 00:08:04,694
嘿，行了
Hey, come on.

138
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:07,131
-行了。行了
-嗯

139
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,066
-好吧
-嗨，亲爱的

140
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,468
来，过去点
Come on, move over

141
00:08:11,504 --> 00:08:13,995
还记得斯戴普家吧
You remember the Stipes.

142
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,667
看，哈里，我说了他在家！
See, Harry, I told you
he was home!

143
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,506
有什么需要帮忙的？
How may we help you?

144
00:08:19,545 --> 00:08:21,672
哈里是你专栏的忠实支持者
Harry is a big fan
of your column,

145
00:08:21,714 --> 00:08:24,182
不过来打个招呼
他是不会罢休的
and he wouldn't let up
until we swung by to say hello.

146
00:08:24,217 --> 00:08:25,707
哈喽！
Hello!

很高兴见到你们。
谢谢你们过来
It's so nice to see you.

148
00:08:31,023 --> 00:08:32,991
嘿，雷，我告诉哈里
Hey, Ray, I told Harry
you would let him see

149
00:08:33,025 --> 00:08:34,993
你可以让他今天就看明天的专栏
tomorrow's column today.

150
00:08:35,027 --> 00:08:36,619
你知道我最喜欢什么？
You know what
I would really like?

151
00:08:36,662 --> 00:08:38,630
如果你能告诉我明天的比分
If you told me
tomorrow's scores.

152
00:08:38,664 --> 00:08:41,792
这样我就能去下注了！
Then I could make
some bets!

153
00:08:44,937 --> 00:08:47,599
妈，你们在干嘛？
干吗把他们带这来？
Ma, what are you doing?
Why did you bring them here?

154
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,336
他们想见你
Well, they wanted
to see you.

155
00:08:50,376 --> 00:08:53,311
好吧，但是黛比拉和我，
我们正……欢呢
Yeah, but Debra and I,
we were... happy.

156
00:08:54,881 --> 00:08:57,475
-就5分钟
-不，妈，不不
- Just five minutes.
- No, Ma, no no.

157
00:08:57,517 --> 00:09:00,350
你干吗这么大惊小怪的？
Why are you making
such a big fuss over it?

158
00:09:00,386 --> 00:09:02,320
我们的朋友想见你
Our friends wanted
to see you.

159
00:09:02,355 --> 00:09:05,188
我想他们看你们的
I want them to see you.

160
00:09:05,224 --> 00:09:07,192
好吧，好
All right, okay.

161
00:09:07,226 --> 00:09:09,194
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

162
00:09:09,228 --> 00:09:12,391
抱歉别人这么喜欢你
I'm sorry people

163
00:09:12,432 --> 00:09:14,923
抱歉我为你骄傲
I'm sorry
that I'm proud of you.

164
00:09:14,967 --> 00:09:18,596
抱歉我把你养成了好孩子
I'm sorry that I raised you
to be a nice boy.

165
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:27,040
-5分钟
-好的，好的
- Five minutes.
- Okay okay.

166
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:29,604
我告诉你，雷
I'll tell you, Ray,

167
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:31,617
你的生活真美妙
you've got the life.

168
00:09:31,651 --> 00:09:33,619
体育作家
Sports writer.

169
00:09:33,653 --> 00:09:35,621
他可以到处走
You get to go
to different places,

170
00:09:35,655 --> 00:09:37,384
和体育明星见面
meet famous athletes.

171
00:09:37,423 --> 00:09:39,118
也有时候比较闷些
Well, yeah,
there could be worse jobs.

172
00:09:39,158 --> 00:09:41,149
嘿，雷
- Hey, Ray.
- Yeah.

173
00:09:41,194 --> 00:09:43,185
嘿，告诉他们早几天
你见着谁了
Hey, tell him whom you met
the other day.

174
00:09:43,229 --> 00:09:45,094
行了，爸
Come on, Dad.

175
00:09:45,131 --> 00:09:46,689
不不，说吧，告诉他，
很有趣的！
No no, come on,
tell him, it's funny!

176
00:09:46,732 --> 00:09:49,428
没什么。Evander Holyfield坐我边上
Nothing. Evander Holyfield
sat next to me.

177
00:09:49,469 --> 00:09:51,869
-哇……
-Evander Holyfield！
- Holy...
- Evander Holyfield!

178
00:09:51,904 --> 00:09:54,839
-我儿子和Evander Holyfield！
-哦天哪！
- My boy and Evander Holyfield!
- Oh my God!

179
00:09:54,874 --> 00:09:57,240
-他是拳击手
-哦
- He's a boxer.
- Oh.

180
00:09:57,276 --> 00:09:59,938
跟上点
Try to keep up.

181
00:10:01,948 --> 00:10:04,178
那么，发生什么了？
So, what happened?

182
00:10:04,217 --> 00:10:06,185
你知道，我就是……
我说：
You know, I just...
I said,

183
00:10:06,219 --> 00:10:08,517
“嘿，怎么样？”
"Hey, how are you doing?"

184
00:10:08,554 --> 00:10:11,523
他说：“还好啦。”
他人不错，挺不错的
He said, "Great. "
He's a good guy. He's a good guy.

185
00:10:11,557 --> 00:10:14,390
-你和他说话了？
-是的，当然
- You talked to him?!
- Yeah, sure sure.

186
00:10:14,427 --> 00:10:16,861
你知道，比方说：“打得不错，是吧？”
这类的话
You know, like, "Good fight, huh?"
That kind of thing.

187
00:10:16,896 --> 00:10:18,363
-是啊
-是的是的
- Yeah.
- Yeah yeah.

188
00:10:18,397 --> 00:10:22,390
喔，多好的故事啊！
Wow, that's a terrific story!

189
00:10:22,435 --> 00:10:24,835
-好了，那么……
-嘿，爸
- Okay, so...
- Hey, Dad,

190
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:26,805
还记得我带你去全明星赛那次吗？
how about the time I took you
to the All-Star Game?

191
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:28,636
剑杂志社包间！
Yeah, press box!

192
00:10:28,674 --> 00:10:31,905
哦，你个幸运的驴蛋！
Oh, you lucky bastard!

193
00:10:31,944 --> 00:10:34,276
我们儿子肯定会喜欢的！
Our son
would love this!

194
00:10:34,313 --> 00:10:36,281
他是个典型的体育疯
He's a regular
sports nut.

195
00:10:36,315 --> 00:10:38,875
听着，听着，
等我从洗手间出来
Listen listen, so I'm coming back
from the bathroom,

196
00:10:38,918 --> 00:10:40,886
我看到我爸站在那，
and I see my father
standing there,

197
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,888
我也不知道我在想什么，
and I don't know
what I'm thinking,

198
00:10:42,922 --> 00:10:45,550
我偷偷走到他后面，
捅了他屁股一下
but I sneak up behind him,
and I kinda goose him a little.

199
00:10:45,591 --> 00:10:47,889
他转过脸……
He turns around...

200
00:10:47,927 --> 00:10:49,986
我捅的是Joe Garagiola（前棒球明星）！
I goosed Joe Garagiola!

201
00:10:52,331 --> 00:10:54,299
当然了，从后面（屁股）看，
Of course, from behind,

202
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:57,029
我长得像Joe Garagiola！
I look
like Joe Garagiola!

203
00:11:00,306 --> 00:11:02,934
-雷
-知道了。他也是个不错的人
- Ray.

204
00:11:02,975 --> 00:11:04,442
Joe人不错
Joe's a good guy.

205
00:11:04,477 --> 00:11:07,071
哦，这多有趣啊！
真高兴你们来了
Oh, isn't this fun?
I'm so glad you came over.

206
00:11:07,113 --> 00:11:09,741
-哦，我们也是
-是的，我们也是
- Oh, we are, too.
- Yeah, us too, us too.

207
00:11:09,782 --> 00:11:11,875
哦，中国菜来了！
都有些什么？
Oh, Chinese here!
What do we got?

208
00:11:11,918 --> 00:11:14,443
嘿，黛比拉，
拿叉子来！
Hey, Deb,
get some forks!

209
00:11:14,487 --> 00:11:16,455
你知道来点什么会很好？
茶
You know what would be nice?
Some tea.

210
00:11:16,489 --> 00:11:19,185
-我去做点茶
-我不介意喝点茶
- I'll make some tea.
- I wouldn't mind some tea.

211
00:11:19,225 --> 00:11:22,160
嘿，你知道谁以前喜欢喝茶吗？
Joe DiMaggio（前棒球明星）
Hey, you know who used to like tea?
Joe DiMaggio.

212
00:11:22,194 --> 00:11:24,321
-不！
-没错，咖啡先生
- No!
- That's right, Mr. Coffee.

213
00:11:26,499 --> 00:11:28,933
你知道谁以前喜欢咖啡？
And you know who used
to like coffee?

214
00:11:28,968 --> 00:11:30,936
T先生（前拳击手，演员）
Mr. T.

215
00:11:40,614 --> 00:11:42,582
-嘿，swizzle（一种鸡尾酒，用小棒搅了喝）
-嘿，别歇着
- Hey swizzle.
- Hey, don't get comfortable.

216
00:11:42,616 --> 00:11:44,641
斯戴普家又要上你爸妈那了
The Stipes are over
visiting your parents again.

217
00:11:44,684 --> 00:11:47,983
我们得赶快走，
说不定他们又打算顺便过来了
We gotta get out of here
in case they decide to drop back over.

218
00:11:48,021 --> 00:11:51,320
-孩子们怎么办？
-罗伯特会看孩子
- What about the kids?
- Robert's babysitting.

219
00:11:51,358 --> 00:11:53,485
非走不可吗？
我刚到家
Do we have to go?
I just got home,

220
00:11:53,527 --> 00:11:55,495
我累了。
躲起来不行吗？
I'm tired.
Can we just hide?

221
00:11:55,529 --> 00:11:57,156
不不不，
别解扣子
No no no,
don't unbutton your shirt.

222
00:11:57,197 --> 00:11:59,028
停下停下！
Stop it,
stop it, stop it!

223
00:11:59,065 --> 00:12:01,625
你又不知道他们肯定会来
You don't know that they're definitely
gonna come over.

224
00:12:01,668 --> 00:12:03,636
你也许还巴不得呢
You'd probably love it
if they did.

225
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:07,128
这样你又可以演一遍
“我漂亮的雷蒙德”
You could do a revival of your
one-man show "My Fair Raymond. "

226
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:10,837
嘿，我只是想帮你
Hey, I was trying
to help out.

227
00:12:10,877 --> 00:12:12,674
结果我被他们缠住脱不了身
That's why I got
stuck there.

228
00:12:12,712 --> 00:12:15,010
-你跑哪去了？
-卧在床上！
- And where did you disappear to anyway?
- I was in bed!

229
00:12:15,048 --> 00:12:18,245
都大半夜了！
你们连个中场休息都没有！
It was midnight!
You don't even have an intermission!

230
00:12:18,285 --> 00:12:20,810
你以为……你以为我喜欢那样吗？
What do you...
do you think I like that?

231
00:12:20,854 --> 00:12:22,412
得了吧！
Come on!

232
00:12:22,455 --> 00:12:25,356
斯戴普z一股阁楼味
Those Stipes smell
like the attic.

233
00:12:25,392 --> 00:12:28,361
嘿，糖在哪？
孩子们想吃糖
Hey, where's the candy?
The kids want some candy.

234
00:12:28,395 --> 00:12:30,363
孩子们知道晚上不许吃糖
The kids know
they're not supposed

235
00:12:30,397 --> 00:12:32,331
好吧
- to have candy at night.
- Okay.

236
00:12:32,365 --> 00:12:34,356
我想吃
I want candy.

237
00:12:38,004 --> 00:12:40,234
冰箱上头，罗伯特
It's on top
of the fridge, Robert.

238
00:12:40,273 --> 00:12:42,332
快点，快点，扣上，
该走了！
Come on, come on, button up,
we gotta get going!

239
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,605
-我们到餐馆给你打电话
-嘿，雷
- We'll call you from the restaurant.
- Hey, Ray,

240
00:12:44,644 --> 00:12:47,044
你怎么不去见见你
最最要好的新朋友呢，
how come you're not going over
to see your new best friends

241
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,877
斯戴普家，哈？
the Stipes, huh?

242
00:12:48,915 --> 00:12:50,712
妈从早到晚
Mom was just
going on and on

243
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,718
都在说他们有多喜欢
你的故事
about how they loved
your stories.

244
00:12:52,752 --> 00:12:55,243
-没错吧，雷？
-我只是不想失礼！
- See, Ray?
- I was being polite!

245
00:12:55,288 --> 00:12:58,189
你知道他们最开始是我朋友
You know they were
my friends first.

246
00:12:58,225 --> 00:13:00,193
他们一准也会喜欢我的故事的
They would have loved
my stories, too.

247
00:13:00,227 --> 00:13:03,025
只是他们来的时候
我碰巧在盆浴
I just happened to be in the sitz bath
when they came over.

248
00:13:03,063 --> 00:13:04,587
好吧，罗伯特，
我们会早点赶回来的
All right.
Robert, we won't be late.

249
00:13:04,631 --> 00:13:06,724
-快点，我们得走了
-我不饿
- Come on, we gotta go.
- I'm not hungry.

250
00:13:06,766 --> 00:13:08,734
我在办公室吃了香蕉船
I had banana splits
at the office.

251
00:13:08,768 --> 00:13:10,759
你们办公室有香蕉船？
You get banana splits
at the office?

252
00:13:11,938 --> 00:13:13,963
我们就吃点开胃点，好了吧？
We'll just have
appetizers, all right?

253
00:13:14,975 --> 00:13:16,943
怎么了？怎么了？
What? What?

254
00:13:16,977 --> 00:13:20,037
-他来了！
-你上哪了？
- There he is!
- Where have you been?

255
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,810
别跟他们搅上。
我们要出去，明白？
Don't get sucked in.
We're going out, you understand?

256
00:13:22,849 --> 00:13:26,216
-嗨！
-他来了，我们的人物!
- Hi!
- There he is, the man of the hour!

257
00:13:26,253 --> 00:13:28,778
你剪头发了？
Did you get a haircut?

258
00:13:28,822 --> 00:13:30,687
不，我梳了一下
No, I just
combed it today.

259
00:13:30,724 --> 00:13:33,090
真不错
There he goes.

260
00:13:33,126 --> 00:13:36,960
雷蒙德，我想你认识我们的儿子赛斯
Raymond, I want you
to meet our son Seth.

261
00:13:36,997 --> 00:13:40,262
-雷・巴伦。终于见面了
-嘿，你好吗？
- Ray Barone. Finally we meet.
- Hey, how are you doing?

262
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,359
-我可是你的忠实读者
-谢谢
- I'm a big fan of yours.
- Thank you.

263
00:13:42,402 --> 00:13:44,233
我们的文风非常相像
We have very similar
writing styles.

264
00:13:44,271 --> 00:13:46,739
-Seth也是个体育作家
-哦
- Seth's a sports writer too.
- Oh.

265
00:13:46,773 --> 00:13:49,606
多数是网络聊天室里
Well, mostly
in internet chat rooms,

266
00:13:49,643 --> 00:13:52,635
体育广播节目里我常打进电话
and I call in
to all the sports radio shows,

267
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:55,477
你很可能听到过我……
Massapequa的赛斯
You probably heard me...
Seth from Massapequa.

268
00:13:56,483 --> 00:13:58,451
哦，是。
非常好，老兄
Oh, yeah.
Great, man,

269
00:13:58,485 --> 00:14:00,112
好极了。
真替你高兴
that's great.
Good for you.

270
00:14:00,153 --> 00:14:02,087
-听着，我们正要出去
- Listen, we were on our way out, right?
- Yes.

271
00:14:02,122 --> 00:14:04,249
等等，你们去哪？
Wait wait wait,
where are you going?

272
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,953
我们只是去吃个晚饭。
请不要拘束
We're just going out to dinner.
You guys make yourselves at home.

273
00:14:06,993 --> 00:14:09,621
玛丽知道东西都在哪
Marie knows
where everything is.

274
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,324
她放的
She put it there.

275
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:15,567
我读了你今天的专栏。
非常棒，棒极了
I read your column today.
Great, just great.

276
00:14:15,602 --> 00:14:17,797
哈利说你比Lupica（体育专栏名作家）更出色
Harry says you're better
than Lupica.

277
00:14:17,837 --> 00:14:19,805
-哦
-谢谢
- Oh.
- Thank you, thank you.

278
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,774
-我喜欢你写的棒球
-谢谢
- I love your baseball stuff.
- Thanks.

279
00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:25,573
只是也许你可以对大都会队
更客观点
Except you could be a little more
objective about the Mets.

280
00:14:28,181 --> 00:14:30,149
-什么？
-雷
- What?
- Ray. Ray.

281
00:14:30,183 --> 00:14:32,913
你感觉像有些动机不纯
You seem to have
a real axe to grind there.

282
00:14:32,953 --> 00:14:34,921
唔……
Well...

283
00:14:34,955 --> 00:14:37,924
你要知道他们给我工钱
是要我写自己的想法
you understand that they pay me
to write my opinions,

284
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,926
而不是要客观
not to be objective.

285
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,928
你知道，我发现
You know, I find

286
00:14:41,962 --> 00:14:45,090
在体育撰稿上，
你要是不肯出重拳
that in sports writing
if you pull your punches,

287
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:47,099
你就会成挨打的人
you're gonna end up
the one getting hit.

288
00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:49,397
哦
Oh.

289
00:14:49,436 --> 00:14:51,404
这才是专业人士，儿子
Now that's a pro, son.

290
00:14:51,438 --> 00:14:53,906
这就是为什么你还在网络里混
That's why you're still
on that internet.

291
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,636
嘿，向大师鞠躬了
Hey, I bow
to the master.

292
00:14:56,676 --> 00:14:58,268
好的
Okay.

293
00:14:58,311 --> 00:15:01,542
嘿，丽塔，哈利。
真抱歉昨晚没见到你们
Hey, Rita, Harry.
Sorry I missed you last night.

294
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:03,412
嘿，罗德尼！
那么……
Hey, Rodney!
So...

295
00:15:05,552 --> 00:15:07,520
给赛斯讲讲
你给我们讲的故事
Tell Seth that story
you were telling us

296
00:15:07,554 --> 00:15:10,284
那只在Kingdome体育馆
爬到你腿上的松鼠
about the squirrel that ran up your leg
at the Kingdome.

297
00:15:10,323 --> 00:15:12,314
哦，太有趣了！
Oh, that was so funny!

298
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:15,692
哦，你跟他们讲松鼠的故事了，哈，雷？
Oh, you told them
the squirrel story, huh, Ray?

299
00:15:15,729 --> 00:15:18,289
那不是Chuck Wilson的故事吗？
Isn't that
Chuck Wilson's story?

300
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:20,094
那不是Chuck Wilson的故事
It's not
Chuck Wilson's story.

301
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:23,796
-是的！
-不是
- Yes, it is!
- It's not.

302
00:15:24,804 --> 00:15:27,136
我来给你们讲个故事
I'll tell you a story.

303
00:15:28,141 --> 00:15:31,406
我最近被头公牛顶了……
I was recently
gored by a bull...

304
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:36,206
那可大过松鼠2000倍
which is about 2000 times
larger than a squirrel.

305
00:15:37,817 --> 00:15:39,785
你知道，他们非法骑牛……
You see, they were having
an illegal rodeo...

306
00:15:39,819 --> 00:15:41,787
哦，在这了！
Oh, here it is!

307
00:15:41,821 --> 00:15:43,584
雷蒙德，介意吗？
Raymond,
would you mind?

308
00:15:43,623 --> 00:15:45,591
-你想给我照张像？
-是的
- You wanna take my picture?
- Yes.

309
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,456
-好吧，当然
-好极了
- Okay, yeah.
- All right.

310
00:15:47,494 --> 00:15:49,587
给，罗德尼
Here, Rodney,

311
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:52,359
介意给我们大家伙照张像吗？
would you mind getting
a picture of all of us?

312
00:15:55,001 --> 00:15:56,969
为什么介意呢？
Why would I mind?

313
00:15:57,003 --> 00:15:59,836
给我的伤痛再加点羞辱
Add a little insult
to my injury.

314
00:15:59,873 --> 00:16:02,137
我也想一起来。
快点，弗兰克
I wanna get in on this.
Come on, Frank.

315
00:16:02,175 --> 00:16:04,143
我也来，不过我最好坐下
I'm in, but I better
sit down,

316
00:16:04,177 --> 00:16:06,907
除非你们想拍我的Garagiola
unless you wanna get
a shot of my Garagiola.

317
00:16:06,946 --> 00:16:09,779
非比寻常的时刻。
我要贴到我的网站上
This is phenomenal.
I'm posting this on my website.

318
00:16:09,816 --> 00:16:12,944
-嘿，对好焦了？
-放心吧
- Hey, you got us in focus there?
- I sure do.

319
00:16:12,986 --> 00:16:15,648
大家一起念：
“雷蒙德”
Everybody say, "Raymond. "

320
00:16:15,688 --> 00:16:18,282
雷蒙德！
Raymond!

321
00:16:21,227 --> 00:16:23,252
真美
Beautiful.

322
00:16:24,864 --> 00:16:27,662
-黛比呢？
-我听到车库门响了
- Where's Deb?
- I heard the garage door.

323
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,600
-不，不
-哦，雷蒙德
- Oh, no.
- Oh, Raymond,

324
00:16:29,636 --> 00:16:31,604
留下陪我们
stay with us.

325
00:16:31,638 --> 00:16:34,129
你想见她什么时候不行啊？
You can see her anytime.

326
00:16:37,043 --> 00:16:38,943
嘿，嘿，
你去哪？
Hey hey hey,
where are you going?

327
00:16:38,978 --> 00:16:41,242
我去吃饭。
我本想叫你一起去的
I'm going to eat.
I would ask you to come along

328
00:16:41,281 --> 00:16:43,511
不过我看到你有了一个女朋友了，
三个男朋友
but I see you have a girlfriend,
and three boyfriends

329
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,643
-还有一个女朋友
-没事的
- and another girlfriend.
- Look, it's okay.

330
00:16:45,685 --> 00:16:47,414
他们说我可以交别的朋友
They said I could see
other people.

331
00:16:47,454 --> 00:16:49,979
-好吧，对不起
-你有问题
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- You have a problem.

332
00:16:50,023 --> 00:16:53,652
把钥匙给我。
这种状态你不能开车
Give me your keys.
You can't drive in this condition.

333
00:16:53,693 --> 00:16:55,854
行了。
我没问题
Come on.
I don't have a problem.

334
00:16:55,895 --> 00:16:58,386
不能这样过了。
你和你父母的联系
This can't keep happening.
You have a sick connection

335
00:16:58,431 --> 00:17:00,126
已经到了变态的程度了。
明白吗？变态！
to your parents.
You understand? Sick!

336
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,225
好吧。
我们已经讨论过这个了
All right.
We've already been over that.

337
00:17:02,268 --> 00:17:04,293
你变本加厉了！
你父母的关心还不够？
You're worse now!
You don't get enough attention

338
00:17:04,337 --> 00:17:06,965
你还得再找一副？
你有病！
from your parents, so you have to get
an extra set? You're sick!

339
00:17:07,006 --> 00:17:08,974
好吧，我再也不这样了。
我很抱……
Okay, I won't do it anymore.
I'm sorr...

340
00:17:09,008 --> 00:17:11,169
啊！怎么样吧？
Ah! What?

341
00:17:11,211 --> 00:17:13,202
我们走，我们溜出去。
我们去吃饭
Let's go, we'll sneak out.
We'll go eat.

342
00:17:13,246 --> 00:17:15,646
嗨，亲爱的
Hi, dears.

343
00:17:15,682 --> 00:17:17,843
-嗨
-什么事情？
- Hi.
- What's going on?

344
00:17:17,884 --> 00:17:19,215
不，没什么
No, nothing.

345
00:17:19,252 --> 00:17:21,220
-没事吧？
-很好，没事
- Everything all right?
- Fine, yeah yeah.

346
00:17:21,254 --> 00:17:24,246
找着你在找的美国汽车协会的
小册子了吗，黛比拉？
Did you find that AAA booklet
you were looking for there, Debra?

347
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,952
你有病！
You're sick!

348
00:17:26,993 --> 00:17:28,961
好吧，继续找
All right,
keep looking.

349
00:17:28,995 --> 00:17:31,589
听我说，我想你和斯戴普家的
Listen, I think
you and the Stipes

350
00:17:31,631 --> 00:17:34,065
也许接下来的时候
应该去你那边
should go to your house,
maybe, for the rest of the night,

351
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,068
因为黛比拉和我说好了出去吃饭的
'cause Debra and I
made plans to go out and eat.

352
00:17:36,102 --> 00:17:39,162
我知道，我知道，
可是你就不能和我们带几分钟吗？
I know, I know, but couldn't you
just spend a few minutes with us?

353
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:41,469
你几乎没和赛斯说什么话
You hardly talked
to Seth at all.

354
00:17:41,508 --> 00:17:43,476
妈，我都不认识赛斯，好吗？
Ma, I don't even
know Seth, okay?

355
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:46,377
我甚至都不认识斯戴普家的。
他们是你们的朋友
I don't even know the Stipes.
The Stipes are your friends.

356
00:17:46,412 --> 00:17:48,676
你为什么不去和你们的朋友
在一起？
Why don't you just go
and be with your friends?

357
00:17:48,715 --> 00:17:50,410
因为我们需要你，雷蒙德
Because we need you,
Raymond.

358
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:53,283
什么意思你需要我？
为什么？
What do you mean,
you need me? Why?

359
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:55,287
爸爸在里面。
他很有趣
Dad's in there.
He's funny.

360
00:17:55,321 --> 00:17:57,516
不，他没有
No, he's not.

361
00:17:58,691 --> 00:18:00,852
你就不能进来几分钟吗？
Could you come in
for just a few minutes?

362
00:18:03,897 --> 00:18:05,762
不不不
No no no.

363
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:07,629
妈，够了，
求你了，够了
Ma, it's enough,
please, it's enough.

364
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:09,635
-好吧
-好的
- Okay okay.
- Yeah.

365
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:11,569
没关系。
我能理解
It's fine.
I understand.

366
00:18:11,604 --> 00:18:14,698
我只是想看你和他们在一起
It's just that I like
to see you with them,

367
00:18:14,741 --> 00:18:18,268
因为我不再能看到你那样子了
because I don't get to see
you like that anymore.

368
00:18:18,311 --> 00:18:20,836
-哪样子？
-唔
- Like what?
- Well,

369
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,848
如今你在家里
when you come over
to the house now,

370
00:18:22,882 --> 00:18:24,850
只是吃吃东西、看看比赛
it's just to eat
or watch a game.

371
00:18:24,884 --> 00:18:26,852
而看你说话时的那种兴奋
It's different
to see you

372
00:18:26,886 --> 00:18:29,514
感觉不一样
excited when
you're talking.

373
00:18:29,556 --> 00:18:31,717
我喜欢这感觉
I like it.

374
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:42,067
好吧
Okay.

375
00:18:42,101 --> 00:18:45,593
我才咱们都该进去了
I guess we should all
go back inside.

376
00:18:45,638 --> 00:18:47,606
真的？是吗？
Really? Yeah?

377
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,608
我猜可以
I guess it's okay.

378
00:18:49,642 --> 00:18:53,601
哦，你真是好儿子。
谢谢，亲爱的
Oh, you're such a good son.
Thank you, honey.

379
00:18:53,646 --> 00:18:55,637
他回来了！

396
00:19:37,657 --> 00:19:40,182
你想多陪陪他们
telling your mom that you wanted
to spend more time with them.

397
00:19:40,226 --> 00:19:41,818
