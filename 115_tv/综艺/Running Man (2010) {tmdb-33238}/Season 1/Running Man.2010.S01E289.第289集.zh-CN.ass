1
00:00:04,038 --> 00:00:05,048
This is Dubai.

2
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:06,338
Wow.

3
00:00:06,438 --> 00:00:08,478
It's so pretty.

4
00:00:08,578 --> 00:00:09,838
This place is amazing.

5
00:00:10,338 --> 00:00:12,238
This is why people talk highly of Dubai.

6
00:00:12,338 --> 00:00:15,208
I never thought Running Man would let us relax like this.

7
00:00:15,238 --> 00:00:17,238
I love that we are allowed to freely travel around here.

8
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:19,038
Ji Hyo! I'm loving this!

9
00:00:19,238 --> 00:00:21,408
Don't you love being here?

10
00:00:21,478 --> 00:00:23,508
- This is tasty. - I was surprised.

11
00:00:23,578 --> 00:00:26,238
(Running Man members have fallen in love with Dubai.)

12
00:00:26,338 --> 00:00:27,478
This is freedom.

13
00:00:28,038 --> 00:00:29,948
(However,)

14
00:00:29,948 --> 00:00:33,308
(their freedom was short-lived and the extreme mission race unfolds.)

15
00:00:33,338 --> 00:00:34,448
This is really dangerous!

16
00:00:34,508 --> 00:00:35,838
It's a real desert. Oh, my.

17
00:00:36,038 --> 00:00:38,108
(There will be no freedom. Those who fail will receive a penalty.)

18
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:40,338
- This is nonsense. - This is too much.

19
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:42,038
(What will happen in Dubai?)

20
00:00:44,938 --> 00:00:46,408
(Running Man in Dubai)

21
00:00:47,408 --> 00:00:50,338
(Incheon International Airport, late at night)

22
00:00:51,608 --> 00:00:54,038
(Running Man tour?)

23
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:55,938
- Hello. - Hello.

24
00:00:56,038 --> 00:00:57,038
- Hello. - Hello.

25
00:00:57,478 --> 00:00:58,708
It's a nice evening.

26
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:01,108
(Welcome to Running Man Tour, individual travelling in Dubai)

27
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:04,108
Individual travelling is valid only when there is no camera.

28
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:05,208
Are we really going to be freely travelling?

29
00:01:05,238 --> 00:01:09,148
Yes. Everyone, welcome to our individual travelling in Dubai.

30
00:01:09,238 --> 00:01:10,938
(Please believe us. It'll be a treat.)

31
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:12,148
- Really? - I love Dubai!

32
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:14,838
- Is this real? - Since you have worked so hard,

33
00:01:14,838 --> 00:01:16,938
we have planned a special vacation to Dubai.

34
00:01:17,038 --> 00:01:18,038
- Really? - Are we really freely travelling?

35
00:01:18,148 --> 00:01:19,938
Don't make us angry from the beginning.

36
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,608
- I think it will be a tough trip. - It'll be a wonderful trip.

37
00:01:23,538 --> 00:01:24,938
(At that moment)

38
00:01:26,138 --> 00:01:29,408
(Is he a tourist guide or a guest?)

39
00:01:31,038 --> 00:01:32,678
- It's a man. - It's a man.

40
00:01:32,738 --> 00:01:34,108
- Why is it a man? - That gait looks familiar.

41
00:01:34,138 --> 00:01:36,108
- Who is it? - I've seen those legs a lot.

42
00:01:36,338 --> 00:01:37,408
- Who is it? - Who?

43
00:01:37,538 --> 00:01:39,238
- It must be Yong Hwa. - It's not him.

44
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:40,578
- Is it not Yong Hwa? - Who is it?

45
00:01:40,638 --> 00:01:42,038
He looks like he has come out here before.

46
00:01:42,138 --> 00:01:43,608
- Yes, he must've been here before. - You're right.

47
00:01:43,678 --> 00:01:45,838
- Isn't it Ji Sung? - Yes, he must've been here before.

48
00:01:45,838 --> 00:01:46,938
(Who could this man be?)

49
00:01:47,238 --> 00:01:48,308
I'm here.

50
00:01:48,338 --> 00:01:49,678
(Jung Il Woo.)

51
00:01:49,738 --> 00:01:50,738
- Jung Il Woo. - Jung Il Woo.

52
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:52,738
Why are you going that way?

53
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:54,838
(He was remembered as the quick and competitive.)

54
00:01:55,238 --> 00:01:56,238
(He swings...)

55
00:01:56,678 --> 00:01:57,738
(and misses.)

56
00:01:58,738 --> 00:02:00,138
(What has happened to Il Woo?)

57
00:02:00,638 --> 00:02:01,838
- It's Il Woo. - Il Woo.

58
00:02:01,838 --> 00:02:04,708
- Hello. - I was about to say his name.

59
00:02:05,048 --> 00:02:06,838
His legs look unique.

60
00:02:06,938 --> 00:02:08,138
I knew it was him from the beginning.

61
00:02:08,238 --> 00:02:09,708
His legs look like that of a runner's.

62
00:02:09,738 --> 00:02:11,048
It's Il Woo.

63
00:02:11,138 --> 00:02:12,308
Il Woo, have you been to Dubai before?

64
00:02:12,338 --> 00:02:13,838
- He has a strong desire to win. - No, it's my first time.

65
00:02:13,938 --> 00:02:14,938
- Is it your first time to Dubai? - Yes.

66
00:02:15,048 --> 00:02:16,838
- Really? - Yes.

67
00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:19,938
(Another person approaches the members.)

68
00:02:20,338 --> 00:02:21,938
It's sea anemone hairstyle.

69
00:02:22,238 --> 00:02:23,838
There's another person coming.

70
00:02:23,938 --> 00:02:25,208
(What?)

71
00:02:26,048 --> 00:02:27,338
(Shy)

72
00:02:27,938 --> 00:02:30,738
Da Hey, don't hide your face.

73
00:02:30,738 --> 00:02:31,838
We know it's you.

74
00:02:31,838 --> 00:02:33,048
It's Da Hey.

75
00:02:33,138 --> 00:02:34,138
(Goodness!)

76
00:02:35,638 --> 00:02:37,048
- Hello, Da Hey. - We know.

77
00:02:37,548 --> 00:02:38,838
It's really Lee Da Hey.

78
00:02:38,938 --> 00:02:40,438
It's been a while.

79
00:02:40,938 --> 00:02:42,838
(She was very active on Running Man and even eliminated the spy.)

80
00:02:42,938 --> 00:02:44,738
Let's get rid of him quickly.

81
00:02:45,108 --> 00:02:47,608
I need to do at least something since I'm on this show.

82
00:02:48,638 --> 00:02:49,838
- Hello. - Hello.

83
00:02:49,938 --> 00:02:51,678
- Hello. - You look great.

84
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:52,938
- Thank you. - You're right.

85
00:02:52,938 --> 00:02:54,408
Isn't Da Hey older than Il Woo?

86
00:02:54,478 --> 00:02:55,838
- Yes, I'm older. - Yes.

87
00:02:55,938 --> 00:02:57,138
These days, it's common to see older women with younger men.

88
00:02:57,238 --> 00:03:00,738
It's been 13 years since I've known Da Hey.

89
00:03:00,838 --> 00:03:02,408
- Really? - That's a long time.

90
00:03:02,478 --> 00:03:05,338
Il Woo visited the broadcasting station 13 years ago.

91
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,938
I had a dream of becoming an actor.

92
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,338
- Oh, it was before you debuted. - He had a short haircut.

93
00:03:09,438 --> 00:03:11,638
- I was really nervous. - Was it during your army service?

94
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:12,838
I bought him...

95
00:03:12,838 --> 00:03:15,708
- jjajangmyeon and jjambbong. - Really?

96
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:16,838
- Oh, really? - Yes.

97
00:03:16,938 --> 00:03:19,338
Let's get going since we have all arrived.

98
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:21,138
I'm still not sure if we'll be able to freely travel.

99
00:03:21,338 --> 00:03:22,408
Are they really going to give it up that easily?

100
00:03:22,478 --> 00:03:24,938
- There's no way they would. - It can't be possible.

101
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,038
It can't be.

102
00:03:26,108 --> 00:03:27,938
(Whether you believe it or not,)

103
00:03:28,038 --> 00:03:32,138
(aren't you excited to depart?)

104
00:03:35,308 --> 00:03:39,038
I heard that in Dubai, people sell gold on the streets.

105
00:03:39,138 --> 00:03:40,138
- Really? - There are even vending machines.

106
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,408
- Yes. - Let's buy some.

107
00:03:42,478 --> 00:03:43,478
(Really?)

108
00:03:44,938 --> 00:03:46,838
The fact that they gave us this is unsettling.

109
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,578
I feel like I need to memorise it.

110
00:03:49,738 --> 00:03:52,838
Or maybe we'll have to go to certain locations in this book...

111
00:03:53,238 --> 00:03:54,308
and carry out a mission.

112
00:03:55,038 --> 00:03:57,038
This worries me. I'm so nervous.

113
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,938
Let's get on board.

114
00:04:00,038 --> 00:04:01,038
Let's go.

115
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,708
(See you later.)

116
00:04:03,608 --> 00:04:05,708
- Goodbye. - Thank you.

117
00:04:05,738 --> 00:04:07,938
(See you later.)

118
00:04:08,578 --> 00:04:09,738
One, two, three.

119
00:04:09,938 --> 00:04:17,038
(Their flight to Dubai took 10 hours and 10 minutes.)

120
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:21,738
(After 10 hours in the air,)

121
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:25,038
(they have arrived in Dubai.)

122
00:04:27,738 --> 00:04:29,238
Oh my gosh!

123
00:04:29,308 --> 00:04:32,578
(Despite it being dawn, many fans came to greet the members.)

124
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:37,108
(Dear Dubai fans, it's nice to meet you all.)

125
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:43,638
(It's the Prince of Asia.)

126
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:47,038
- Lee Kwang Soo! - Lee Kwang Soo!

127
00:04:49,738 --> 00:04:51,608
Kwang Soo is very popular.

128
00:04:52,938 --> 00:04:55,138
(Has Kwang Soo won over Dubai, too?)

129
00:04:56,848 --> 00:04:57,848
(Shy)

130
00:04:59,538 --> 00:05:04,138
(Thank you, fans of Running Man!)

131
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,738
This show is really popular.

132
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,038
Hi.

133
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:08,938
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

134
00:05:09,238 --> 00:05:11,138
You're like idol stars.

135
00:05:12,738 --> 00:05:14,938
- In Arabic... - What time is it?

136
00:05:14,938 --> 00:05:16,208
I think it's about 5am here.

137
00:05:16,238 --> 00:05:18,438
- It's 6am. - It's 6:13am.

138
00:05:18,508 --> 00:05:20,848
- Is it already morning? - It must be around 11am in Korea.

139
00:05:20,938 --> 00:05:22,038
- Yes. - Do you mean it's eleven o'clock...

140
00:05:22,138 --> 00:05:23,208
in the morning?

141
00:05:23,238 --> 00:05:25,438
- It's very clean and... - It's neat.

142
00:05:25,508 --> 00:05:26,678
very detailed.

143
00:05:27,308 --> 00:05:28,738
That building is so tall.

144
00:05:28,838 --> 00:05:29,838
Which one?

145
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:32,738
- That's the one! - It's that one!

146
00:05:32,838 --> 00:05:34,678
- It's that one. - "Mission: Impossible".

147
00:05:34,738 --> 00:05:35,738
- I can't even see the top. - Oh, my.

148
00:05:35,838 --> 00:05:37,138
I can't see the very top!

149
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:38,738
- It's Burj Khalifa. - I saw it in the book.

150
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:39,838
Where is it?

151
00:05:39,938 --> 00:05:41,238
- Over there. - It was in "Mission: Impossible".

152
00:05:41,338 --> 00:05:43,608
Over there. It's Burj Khalifa.

153
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:45,038
I can't see.

154
00:05:45,138 --> 00:05:47,138
- That's amazing. - Take a picture, Kwang Soo.

155
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:48,708
- Wait. - My goodness.

156
00:05:48,938 --> 00:05:50,838
- I can't see the top. - So that's the one.

157
00:05:50,938 --> 00:05:52,438
That has 203 floors, right?

158
00:05:52,508 --> 00:05:53,838
- Wow! - Gosh, that's amazing!

159
00:05:53,938 --> 00:05:55,108
It's so tall.

160
00:05:55,678 --> 00:05:57,608
It's a real skyscraper.

161
00:05:58,308 --> 00:05:59,338
I can't see.

162
00:05:59,438 --> 00:06:00,638
You need to duck a little to see it.

163
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,738
- This is... - It's over here.

164
00:06:02,838 --> 00:06:04,238
just amazing.

165
00:06:04,308 --> 00:06:07,708
(Burj Khalifa is the world's tallest building with a height of 829.8m.)

166
00:06:08,138 --> 00:06:09,638
- I really can't see it. - I bet...

167
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:13,638
I bet you could see that when you're riding a helicopter.

168
00:06:13,938 --> 00:06:15,108
It's amazing.

169
00:06:15,138 --> 00:06:16,578
It's really tall.

170
00:06:16,638 --> 00:06:18,238
- Really? - It's so amazing.

171
00:06:18,638 --> 00:06:19,738
How tall is it?

172
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:20,938
Gosh, that's really tall.

173
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:22,608
- Where? - Look at that.

174
00:06:22,678 --> 00:06:24,638
We must be going over there.

175
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:25,838
That's what I was told.

176
00:06:26,138 --> 00:06:27,208
- Goodness. - Really?

177
00:06:27,238 --> 00:06:28,408
Have we arrived?

178
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:29,638
(He is deeply moved.)

179
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,108
- This is where... - Oh, my.

180
00:06:31,138 --> 00:06:32,738
Tom Cruise ran.

181
00:06:32,738 --> 00:06:34,138
- This place? - Tom Cruise.

182
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,238
- Tom Cruise. - From "Mission: Impossible".

183
00:06:37,238 --> 00:06:39,478
- It looks really splendid. - It's that place.

184
00:06:40,038 --> 00:06:41,438
It's that scene where he climbed up wearing the gloves.

185
00:06:41,508 --> 00:06:42,508
Are we going up?

186
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,338
Can we go?

187
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:48,838
The people living up there should have their parachutes ready.

188
00:06:49,738 --> 00:06:51,838
(They enter the building to get in the lift.)

189
00:06:54,608 --> 00:06:56,108
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

190
00:06:56,338 --> 00:06:57,478
What are you going to press?

191
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:01,538
There are only two buttons, ground floor and 124th floor.

192
00:07:01,608 --> 00:07:02,738
(There are only two buttons, for the ground and 124th floor.)

193
00:07:02,738 --> 00:07:03,738
It's right here.

194
00:07:06,438 --> 00:07:07,738
It goes directly up.

195
00:07:07,938 --> 00:07:09,578
- Are we going up now? - Yes.

196
00:07:10,608 --> 00:07:11,678
What is this?

197
00:07:12,408 --> 00:07:13,438
The music is nice.

198
00:07:13,508 --> 00:07:14,538
We're on the seventh floor.

199
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:15,838
Are we going up?

200
00:07:15,838 --> 00:07:16,938
It's going so fast.

201
00:07:16,938 --> 00:07:20,038
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19...

202
00:07:20,138 --> 00:07:21,638
- My ears feel funny. - 20, 21, 22...

203
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:22,938
- Me too. - Really.

204
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,238
We're on the 27th floor. My ears feels funny.

205
00:07:25,338 --> 00:07:26,808
- Hold your breath. - It's so fast.

206
00:07:26,838 --> 00:07:28,938
- Goodness. - My ears feel funny.

207
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:30,108
(It takes only a minute to reach the 124th floor.)

208
00:07:30,138 --> 00:07:31,338
I swallowed eight times.

209
00:07:31,438 --> 00:07:33,578
- It's scary. - There's no...

210
00:07:33,638 --> 00:07:34,678
We're on the 55th floor.

211
00:07:34,738 --> 00:07:35,938
- We're on the 58th floor. - It's going faster.

212
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,038
It's nearly...

213
00:07:39,138 --> 00:07:40,438
We're almost on the 80th floor.

214
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,038
We're already so high up.

215
00:07:42,108 --> 00:07:43,138
This is terrifying.

216
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,538
My heart is thumping so hard.

217
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:47,038
Wow, we're already here.

218
00:07:47,138 --> 00:07:50,038
- The music is quite... - It's the world's tallest building.

219
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:52,208
- Oh, my. - We're here. It's like a scene...

220
00:07:52,308 --> 00:07:53,478
from the movies.

221
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:54,738
I thought I was on a ride.

222
00:07:54,938 --> 00:07:57,538
(Amazed)

223
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:00,638
This is amazing.

224
00:08:01,608 --> 00:08:04,678
(In just 1 minute,)

225
00:08:04,738 --> 00:08:08,338
(they arrived in a whole new world.)

226
00:08:10,608 --> 00:08:11,838
- This is amazing. - It's amazing.

227
00:08:13,408 --> 00:08:15,738
(Are you ready for this?)

228
00:08:21,938 --> 00:08:23,708
- It's scary. - We're really high up.

229
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:26,138
(The sun rises above the horizon.)

230
00:08:26,238 --> 00:08:28,038
It's so high.

231
00:08:28,638 --> 00:08:29,738
This is unbelievable.

232
00:08:29,738 --> 00:08:30,738
(They can look over skyscrapers.)

233
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,638
This is a scene from "Mission: Impossible".

234
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:34,708
(This is unbelievable.)

235
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,578
- It's scary. - It's so high up.

236
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:39,708
I can't believe this.

237
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:42,738
It's so high.

238
00:08:43,408 --> 00:08:44,608
This is unbelievable.

239
00:08:44,678 --> 00:08:46,308
(They are at a loss for words.)

240
00:08:46,338 --> 00:08:48,338
When shooting "Mission: Impossible",

241
00:08:48,538 --> 00:08:50,238
Tom Cruise came here, right?

242
00:08:50,338 --> 00:08:52,508
I got goosebumps.

243
00:08:52,578 --> 00:08:53,738
It's too tall.

244
00:08:53,838 --> 00:08:55,208
I'm getting tingling feelings.

245
00:08:55,238 --> 00:08:57,678
- This is amazing. - Over here. I can't get any closer.

246
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:59,948
(The splendid view of the skyline is revealed.)

247
00:09:00,038 --> 00:09:01,838
Why are you trying to show me?

248
00:09:03,138 --> 00:09:04,478
You came a long way.

249
00:09:04,538 --> 00:09:05,538
- Yes. - Yes.

250
00:09:05,608 --> 00:09:09,838
As you have all heard before we departed Korea,

251
00:09:10,038 --> 00:09:11,738
you will be travelling freely.

252
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:15,708
You can explore Dubai freely.

253
00:09:15,778 --> 00:09:16,878
Really?

254
00:09:16,948 --> 00:09:18,308
- No way. - I don't believe it.

255
00:09:18,608 --> 00:09:21,238
(There has to be something more.)

256
00:09:22,138 --> 00:09:23,878
We'll hand out the itinerary first.

257
00:09:24,038 --> 00:09:25,138
- Really? - Yes.

258
00:09:25,238 --> 00:09:26,408
This can't be true.

259
00:09:26,808 --> 00:09:28,838
- This can't be. - Can we go anywhere we want?

260
00:09:28,948 --> 00:09:31,108
- Can we go clubbing at night? - They have name tags on them.

261
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,508
- "Jung Il Woo". - I should put it in here.

262
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:34,678
Yes, in the front.

263
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:38,408
You have the itinerary in your bag.

264
00:09:38,508 --> 00:09:39,508
What is this?

265
00:09:39,508 --> 00:09:41,608
What are these mysterious blanks?

266
00:09:41,608 --> 00:09:43,508
- All right. - We're supposed to fill them.

267
00:09:43,508 --> 00:09:45,038
- So this is our itinerary. - Starting from...

268
00:09:45,138 --> 00:09:47,108
the tallest building in the world, Burj Khalifa,

269
00:09:47,138 --> 00:09:49,838
you'll visit tourist attractions in Dubai...

270
00:09:49,878 --> 00:09:52,338
- described in the itinerary. - Okay.

271
00:09:52,408 --> 00:09:55,608
- You can choose where to go. - Can we go anywhere?

272
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,778
Yes, enjoy the places as much as you want.

273
00:09:57,878 --> 00:09:59,878
- Look at this! What is this? - Enjoy some food as well.

274
00:09:59,948 --> 00:10:01,948
- There's ziplining! - In your bag...

275
00:10:02,038 --> 00:10:03,838
- Look at this. - We can choose not to go.

276
00:10:03,878 --> 00:10:05,778
You can choose not to go.

277
00:10:06,308 --> 00:10:09,238
Who did you think would attempt skydiving?

278
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:10,878
- When you arrive... - Is there skydiving as well?

279
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:12,678
- There is. - Yes.

280
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,208
After completing your mission, you can move to another place.

281
00:10:15,308 --> 00:10:17,308
Just go anywhere you want.

282
00:10:17,778 --> 00:10:19,678
Have some fun and try out the mission.

283
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,678
- That's all you need to do. - Really?

284
00:10:21,738 --> 00:10:23,138
- There's a beach. - When you're there...

285
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,508
So we don't have to go skydiving, right?

286
00:10:24,508 --> 00:10:26,678
- Of course not. - Really?

287
00:10:26,878 --> 00:10:30,738
Next to each place in the itinerary, you'll see a star.

288
00:10:30,978 --> 00:10:33,948
The stars indicate how hard the mission will be.

289
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,608
When you complete each mission,

290
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:39,608
you'll get a grasshopper stamp...

291
00:10:39,678 --> 00:10:41,948
as Dubai means "Grasshopper" in their old language.

292
00:10:42,038 --> 00:10:44,038
- Really? - It means "Grasshopper".

293
00:10:44,138 --> 00:10:46,408
- Dubai! - This is...

294
00:10:46,508 --> 00:10:47,838
my second home.

295
00:10:47,878 --> 00:10:49,108
This is your city.

296
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,708
(Welcome to the land of grasshoppers.)

297
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:55,038
So... Until the desert tour starts...

298
00:10:55,108 --> 00:10:58,308
- It starts at 3pm. - If you get 10 stamps...

299
00:10:58,408 --> 00:10:59,778
- Gosh. - 10 stamps?

300
00:10:59,838 --> 00:11:02,338
You'll get to stay at a luxurious resort.

301
00:11:02,338 --> 00:11:03,738
- Wow. - Really?

302
00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:04,978
- The thing is, - Without the staff?

303
00:11:05,038 --> 00:11:07,308
the resort is in the middle of the desert.

304
00:11:07,408 --> 00:11:10,138
- Out of the nine of you, - Yes.

305
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,608
only five will get to stay there.

306
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:17,408
(Then what about the remaining 4?)

307
00:11:17,508 --> 00:11:21,208
The others will bivouac in the desert.

308
00:11:21,238 --> 00:11:23,778
(4 people with the least stamps will bivouac.)

309
00:11:23,878 --> 00:11:27,978
(Sleeping in the desert?)

310
00:11:28,838 --> 00:11:31,308
(Which unlucky 4 will end up spending the night in the desert?)

311
00:11:31,408 --> 00:11:34,508
(Welcome to the desert.)

312
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,138
You'll bivouac in the desert.

313
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,878
Desert Team, gather around.

314
00:11:37,978 --> 00:11:40,108
(Let's not have foolish hopes and just sleep in the desert.)

315
00:11:40,138 --> 00:11:42,208
- Let's go to the desert! - Come here.

316
00:11:42,238 --> 00:11:44,738
All right. Now we have the desert team.

317
00:11:44,778 --> 00:11:46,408
Those five will go to the resort.

318
00:11:46,408 --> 00:11:48,878
(The unlucky 4 have formed a bivouacking team.)

319
00:11:48,878 --> 00:11:49,978
Ji Hyo is included in that team.

320
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:51,978
- And... - Wait.

321
00:11:52,038 --> 00:11:54,508
These guys will sleep in the desert.

322
00:11:55,308 --> 00:11:57,408
Why are you excluding yourself?

323
00:11:57,678 --> 00:12:00,408
- You're our leader. - What?

324
00:12:00,408 --> 00:12:01,938
- This is crazy. - One more thing.

325
00:12:02,038 --> 00:12:04,238
We talked about a luxurious resort in the desert.

326
00:12:04,508 --> 00:12:08,308
We filmed it with this camera. Wear it and you'll see.

327
00:12:08,408 --> 00:12:10,308
- This is where you might sleep. - Really?

328
00:12:10,408 --> 00:12:12,708
- Describe it for us. - Try it.

329
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,408
- Turn it on. - Can I blink?

330
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,138
- This is amazing. - It's moving.

331
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,708
If you turn left, you can see the left side.

332
00:12:19,838 --> 00:12:21,408
- Oh, really? - That's incredible.

333
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:23,208
These high-tech glasses don't really look good on you.

334
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,038
You should wear them all the time.

335
00:12:26,608 --> 00:12:28,408
You look great.

336
00:12:29,978 --> 00:12:31,108
Who is this?

337
00:12:31,408 --> 00:12:32,408
Try it.

338
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,508
We should see it now.

339
00:12:35,608 --> 00:12:36,838
Who is this?

340
00:12:36,878 --> 00:12:38,408
- Who? - Oh, my.

341
00:12:38,408 --> 00:12:39,508
Is someone there?

342
00:12:39,608 --> 00:12:41,708
I see a beautiful lady.

343
00:12:41,778 --> 00:12:42,878
Let me see!

344
00:12:42,938 --> 00:12:44,238
(I want to see it, too.)

345
00:12:45,038 --> 00:12:46,138
I saw a lady.

346
00:12:46,238 --> 00:12:47,878
- Really? - Yes, try it.

347
00:12:50,138 --> 00:12:51,938
- This is amazing. - Can I try?

348
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:53,878
- Go ahead. - Wow.

349
00:12:53,978 --> 00:12:55,508
Wait. I just put them on.

350
00:12:55,738 --> 00:12:56,878
Let's take turns.

351
00:12:56,938 --> 00:12:58,408
It's incredible.

352
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,208
Give us another pair for Da Hey.

353
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:01,408
This is...

354
00:13:01,508 --> 00:13:03,708
the desert where four of you will sleep.

355
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:04,838
- Oh, really? - Take a look.

356
00:13:04,838 --> 00:13:06,708
- How is it? - This is completely desolate.

357
00:13:07,738 --> 00:13:09,708
- It's a real desert. - How is it?

358
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:11,878
- How does it look? - There's nothing in this desert.

359
00:13:11,978 --> 00:13:13,238
(Four of them will sleep here tonight.)

360
00:13:13,308 --> 00:13:14,708
- Let me see. - What is this?

361
00:13:15,308 --> 00:13:16,608
I want to sleep at the hotel.

362
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:17,738
(I want to sleep at the hotel.)

363
00:13:17,878 --> 00:13:19,608
I want to sleep at the hotel, too.

364
00:13:20,138 --> 00:13:22,038
- Jong Kook... - I want to sleep at the hotel.

365
00:13:22,138 --> 00:13:24,338
is persuading me to go skydiving with him.

366
00:13:24,508 --> 00:13:25,878
Jong Kook, are you going to do it?

367
00:13:25,978 --> 00:13:28,138
- Are you going to go skydiving? - Yes, I am.

368
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,308
I've always wanted to try skydiving.

369
00:13:31,308 --> 00:13:33,308
Really? Then do it today, Il Woo.

370
00:13:33,408 --> 00:13:35,708
- Do it. - You two should do it.

371
00:13:35,778 --> 00:13:36,808
It's decided now.

372
00:13:36,878 --> 00:13:39,238
I hope you two go skydiving and then disappear from the programme.

373
00:13:39,938 --> 00:13:41,308
(Let's get it over with and have some fun.)

374
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,038
- We will freely explore the city. - Sure.

375
00:13:44,108 --> 00:13:45,778
- Let's go. - Welcome to...

376
00:13:45,838 --> 00:13:47,238
- the land of grasshoppers - the land of grasshoppers

377
00:13:47,508 --> 00:13:50,508
Welcome to the land of grasshoppers

378
00:13:50,608 --> 00:13:53,978
(Let's go to the centre of Dubai!)

379
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,208
It'll be so fun.

380
00:13:55,408 --> 00:14:00,308
(7am: Have breakfast and make plans)

381
00:14:01,138 --> 00:14:02,508
Where should I go?

382
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:04,508
Right, we should decide.

383
00:14:04,608 --> 00:14:05,838
Let's team up, cowards.

384
00:14:05,938 --> 00:14:07,138
I'll start with...

385
00:14:07,408 --> 00:14:08,938
JBR Beach.

386
00:14:09,408 --> 00:14:11,408
I want to try Souk Madinat Jumeirah.

387
00:14:11,408 --> 00:14:13,408
I'm going to go to a cafe after skydiving.

388
00:14:13,408 --> 00:14:16,808
Jong Kook and Il Woo will be free after skydiving.

389
00:14:16,838 --> 00:14:18,038
I envy them.

390
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:19,408
Are you going to a cafe?

391
00:14:20,978 --> 00:14:22,738
Can only two people go skydiving?

392
00:14:23,778 --> 00:14:24,878
Are you interested?

393
00:14:24,938 --> 00:14:29,038
(Will Da Hey go skydiving?)

394
00:14:29,408 --> 00:14:30,738
I'll go if nobody else wants to.

395
00:14:30,978 --> 00:14:32,408
(She's willing to go skydiving!)

396
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:34,778
Will it be scary?

397
00:14:34,838 --> 00:14:35,978
(Da Hey joins the skydiving team.)

398
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:40,038
(Sunglasses are a must when travelling.)

399
00:14:42,138 --> 00:14:43,208
How do I look?

400
00:14:44,038 --> 00:14:45,738
(They prepare themselves for the trip.)

401
00:14:45,778 --> 00:14:47,238
- Kwang Soo. - Let's take a picture.

402
00:14:47,308 --> 00:14:49,508
(They prepare themselves for the trip.)

403
00:14:49,838 --> 00:14:51,778
This is going to be fun.

404
00:14:51,878 --> 00:14:53,978
(Should we start the journey?)

405
00:14:54,308 --> 00:14:58,408
(They all depart to different destinations.)

406
00:15:00,408 --> 00:15:02,338
(Running Man in Dubai)

407
00:15:03,238 --> 00:15:05,508
(8am: Jong Kook and Il Woo head to the skydiving place.)

408
00:15:05,608 --> 00:15:07,308
Palm Jumeirah, please.

409
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:08,708
Yes, thank you.

410
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:13,238
I had the chance to go skydiving when I was in my 20s.

411
00:15:13,608 --> 00:15:15,038
But I gave that chance to someone else.

412
00:15:16,508 --> 00:15:17,978
And I regretted doing so.

413
00:15:18,038 --> 00:15:20,508
I thought I would have many chances to go skydiving in the future,

414
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,878
but I haven't had one yet.

415
00:15:22,938 --> 00:15:24,978
Now that we're in Dubai,

416
00:15:25,738 --> 00:15:27,938
- we should try it. - Of course.

417
00:15:28,508 --> 00:15:31,778
I never imagined I would skydive in Dubai.

418
00:15:31,838 --> 00:15:33,438
Gosh, I'm really looking forward.

419
00:15:34,738 --> 00:15:36,308
My heart is pounding.

420
00:15:36,408 --> 00:15:38,108
Gosh. What should I do?

421
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,308
Why did I volunteer?

422
00:15:40,308 --> 00:15:41,708
(She's starting to regret her decision.)

423
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:45,108
I can still give up. I'll go there and see...

424
00:15:46,138 --> 00:15:47,708
if I can do it.

425
00:15:48,678 --> 00:15:49,878
(Is she going crazy?)

426
00:15:49,938 --> 00:15:51,108
What should I do?

427
00:15:51,308 --> 00:15:53,308
(She can't keep her fingers still.)

428
00:15:55,508 --> 00:15:57,138
Just talk to me.

429
00:15:57,738 --> 00:15:58,838
(She's getting more and more nervous.)

430
00:15:58,878 --> 00:16:00,508
Mum.

431
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:02,338
No, no.

432
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,138
I actually do better...

433
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,938
when I'm at the scene.

434
00:16:07,608 --> 00:16:08,608
So...

435
00:16:09,508 --> 00:16:10,608
Really?

436
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:11,738
Are you really strong?

437
00:16:11,878 --> 00:16:13,508
Don't lie to yourself.

438
00:16:13,508 --> 00:16:15,408
(Have I made the wrong decision?)

439
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:16,978
My mum says I'm crazy.

440
00:16:18,138 --> 00:16:20,508
Have I really gone crazy?

441
00:16:20,608 --> 00:16:22,738
(Driving through the city for 40 minutes)

442
00:16:22,778 --> 00:16:26,708
(8:40am: Jong Kook, Il Woo and Da Hey arrive)

443
00:16:26,808 --> 00:16:28,108
It says "Skydive Dubai".

444
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:33,608
(We're here after all.)

445
00:16:33,678 --> 00:16:35,108
We really arrived here.

446
00:16:36,408 --> 00:16:42,138
(Where is this place that fits best for skydiving?)

447
00:16:42,978 --> 00:16:48,408
(Palm Jumeirah, the world's largest artificial island,)

448
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:54,138
(looks like a hand viewed from above.)

449
00:16:56,878 --> 00:16:58,038
(Sighing)

450
00:16:58,138 --> 00:16:59,138
I'm not nervous.

451
00:16:59,508 --> 00:17:00,938
- Aren't you nervous? - No.

452
00:17:01,678 --> 00:17:03,108
I'm getting nervous now that we're here.

453
00:17:06,148 --> 00:17:07,878
I'm having spaghetti legs.

454
00:17:07,978 --> 00:17:10,408
(The trio arrive at the skydiving place.)

455
00:17:10,508 --> 00:17:12,038
- What is this? - We'll be instructed here.

456
00:17:12,148 --> 00:17:13,408
- Should we go this way? - This way.

457
00:17:13,978 --> 00:17:15,708
Are we signing the agreement here?

458
00:17:15,778 --> 00:17:17,508
Right, we should do that.

459
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,148
Are we signing an agreement?

460
00:17:20,108 --> 00:17:21,838
I hate signing papers.

461
00:17:21,878 --> 00:17:23,608
(You have to sign an agreement regarding safety.)

462
00:17:23,678 --> 00:17:25,038
Why do we have to sign this?

463
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:26,938
This feels serious.

464
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:28,038
Really.

465
00:17:28,408 --> 00:17:29,678
I'm getting nervous.

466
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:31,738
Gosh.

467
00:17:32,608 --> 00:17:33,678
I'm going crazy.

468
00:17:33,938 --> 00:17:35,148
Have you ever bungee jumped before?

469
00:17:35,238 --> 00:17:37,408
No, I have never done anything like that.

470
00:17:37,838 --> 00:17:39,838
- And you came here? - I'm crazy, right?

471
00:17:39,878 --> 00:17:42,408
I think I'm out of my mind.

472
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:44,508
- Probably. - You haven't tried anything?

473
00:17:44,508 --> 00:17:46,308
Gosh. I think she might faint.

474
00:17:46,408 --> 00:17:48,408
At water parks,

475
00:17:48,508 --> 00:17:50,308
they have steep slides.

476
00:17:50,408 --> 00:17:51,678
- Oh, those. - They have slides there.

477
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:52,708
Even those...

478
00:17:52,778 --> 00:17:54,738
almost gave me a heart attack.

479
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:57,148
You can't compare this with slides.

480
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,408
- We're jumping off a plane. - Exactly.

481
00:17:59,408 --> 00:18:01,308
Have you looked out the window on a plane?

482
00:18:01,678 --> 00:18:03,508
- That's how high this will be. - Wait.

483
00:18:05,508 --> 00:18:06,678
"Jumping off a plane"?

484
00:18:07,738 --> 00:18:08,938
- Yes. - Are we?

485
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:10,148
- Of course. - Yes, we are.

486
00:18:10,408 --> 00:18:11,778
- Then what did you think? - I thought...

487
00:18:11,838 --> 00:18:12,938
(I thought...)

488
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:14,708
- it'd be like bungee jumping. - That's nonsense.

489
00:18:14,738 --> 00:18:16,238
- Gosh. - We're actually jumping off...

490
00:18:16,308 --> 00:18:17,978
- an aeroplane. - It's true.

491
00:18:18,778 --> 00:18:20,148
- I had no idea. - Really?

492
00:18:20,238 --> 00:18:21,508
Are we really jumping off an aeroplane?

493
00:18:21,508 --> 00:18:22,978
- Yes. - We'll jump off an airplane.

494
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:24,148
The plane's door will be open.

495
00:18:25,408 --> 00:18:26,538
- Seriously? - What should I do?

496
00:18:26,608 --> 00:18:28,338
- Did you really not know? - Are you sure?

497
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:30,438
Da Hey didn't know we're jumping off a plane.

498
00:18:31,108 --> 00:18:32,838
She thought this would be like bungee jumping.

499
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,408
I thought we would jump off a tall building.

500
00:18:34,508 --> 00:18:36,108
Wouldn't it be the same?

501
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,208
How many times do I have to tell you that we're riding an aeroplane?

502
00:18:38,238 --> 00:18:41,208
While the plane's flying, we'll be jumping off.

503
00:18:41,938 --> 00:18:44,738
Planes go up as high as the clouds.

504
00:18:44,778 --> 00:18:46,038
And we'll jump from there.

505
00:18:46,108 --> 00:18:47,838
- Like airborne troops? - Exactly.

506
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:49,308
- Like airborne troops? - Yes.

507
00:18:49,408 --> 00:18:50,608
It's something like that.

508
00:18:50,678 --> 00:18:53,708
(I must be dreaming.)

509
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:58,148
Or you can just give up now and go straight to the desert.

510
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:00,308
(They need to invest time into preparing for this.)

511
00:19:00,408 --> 00:19:01,408
Wait.

512
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:04,038
(They need to invest time into preparing for this.)

513
00:19:04,148 --> 00:19:05,208
Should I give up?

514
00:19:05,238 --> 00:19:07,308
I don't think I can jump off an aeroplane.

515
00:19:07,408 --> 00:19:10,708
(If she wants to give up, she should decide while she still can.)

516
00:19:12,108 --> 00:19:14,508
(Will she take the challenge?)

517
00:19:14,608 --> 00:19:17,678
(Or will she give up?)

518
00:19:18,108 --> 00:19:19,108
I'm nervous.

519
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,938
(What will Da Hey choose to do?)

520
00:19:21,978 --> 00:19:23,208
This is crazy.

521
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,608
(Palm Jumeirah, sky diving)

522
00:19:26,678 --> 00:19:28,778
(Haha and Kwang Soo go to...)

523
00:19:28,878 --> 00:19:29,878
(JBR Beach.)

524
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:31,938
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

525
00:19:32,508 --> 00:19:34,508
I don't want to sleep in the desert.

526
00:19:34,578 --> 00:19:36,148
But it's a shame.

527
00:19:36,978 --> 00:19:38,408
We have to at least take a bath.

528
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,608
You've never heard about how it's like in the desert, right?

529
00:19:41,108 --> 00:19:42,238
I heard it's really cold.

530
00:19:42,738 --> 00:19:44,148
It gets unbelievably cold at night.

531
00:19:44,778 --> 00:19:45,778
I could never do it.

532
00:19:45,838 --> 00:19:46,878
(He can't stay at the desert.)

533
00:19:48,108 --> 00:19:51,308
Jae Seok, Seok Jin and Gary fit the desert.

534
00:19:51,508 --> 00:19:54,778
- We're too... - Stylish? How should I put it?

535
00:19:54,838 --> 00:19:57,338
We fit into hotels better.

536
00:19:57,408 --> 00:19:58,608
- Who does? - Us.

537
00:19:58,648 --> 00:19:59,708
Us? Gosh...

538
00:19:59,738 --> 00:20:01,578
We're too sophisticated.

539
00:20:01,648 --> 00:20:03,978
I thought there wouldn't be traffic in Dubai, but there is.

540
00:20:04,308 --> 00:20:07,838
Dubai is five times bigger than Seoul...

541
00:20:07,878 --> 00:20:08,978
in terms of area.

542
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:10,778
- But... - What?

543
00:20:10,838 --> 00:20:11,978
It's five times bigger than Seoul.

544
00:20:12,108 --> 00:20:13,308
Than how much bigger is it than Korea?

545
00:20:16,878 --> 00:20:18,938
Don't show off your knowledge...

546
00:20:18,978 --> 00:20:20,678
when you don't know anything.

547
00:20:20,738 --> 00:20:21,938
I'm sure it's smaller than Korea.

548
00:20:21,938 --> 00:20:23,938
Gosh...

549
00:20:23,978 --> 00:20:25,478
- You are so frustrating. - All right.

550
00:20:25,508 --> 00:20:26,608
Okay.

551
00:20:26,678 --> 00:20:28,878
Can you ask in English when the shuttle bus...

552
00:20:28,938 --> 00:20:30,648
for Dubai Mall departs?

553
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,338
- Ask what time it departs. - You should do it.

554
00:20:32,408 --> 00:20:34,578
- You should do it. - You shouldn't be intimidated.

555
00:20:34,648 --> 00:20:36,808
Dubai Mall. Shuttle bus.

556
00:20:36,838 --> 00:20:37,878
What time?

557
00:20:38,578 --> 00:20:40,578
- That will do. - Gosh...

558
00:20:40,648 --> 00:20:42,108
Take it slowly. You don't have to rush.

559
00:20:42,148 --> 00:20:45,338
(Enroll in Seok Jin's breakthrough English conversation class now!)

560
00:20:45,508 --> 00:20:46,708
You are impossible.

561
00:20:46,808 --> 00:20:48,208
Do you want me to talk to the driver?

562
00:20:48,308 --> 00:20:51,208
- Don't. He's driving. - Sir.

563
00:20:51,238 --> 00:20:52,978
- Married? - Yes, married.

564
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:54,108
Yes.

565
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:59,208
How many daughters... And how many sons?

566
00:20:59,238 --> 00:21:00,508
I have two daughters.

567
00:21:00,608 --> 00:21:02,108
- Two daughters? - I will tell you...

568
00:21:02,148 --> 00:21:03,838
how you sound in...

569
00:21:03,878 --> 00:21:05,978
- I can manage. - Korean.

570
00:21:06,108 --> 00:21:08,878
- How does it sound? - "Sir, married?"

571
00:21:08,938 --> 00:21:09,978
(It sounds very awkward.)

572
00:21:10,108 --> 00:21:11,148
(These two words have completed a question.)

573
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,738
- Sir, married? - Sir, married?

574
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,308
How many sons? How many daughters?

575
00:21:14,408 --> 00:21:15,738
Right.

576
00:21:15,838 --> 00:21:17,208
- And he understood. - That's how it sounded.

577
00:21:17,238 --> 00:21:19,108
- But he understood. - That's how it sounded like.

578
00:21:19,148 --> 00:21:21,978
- How many sons? - Gosh...

579
00:21:22,108 --> 00:21:23,108
How many daughters?

580
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,208
(Meanwhile, they enter a mysterious gate.)

581
00:21:24,308 --> 00:21:26,108
This is Dubai's... Are we there?

582
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,508
(Is it here?)

583
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,878
Finally, we arrived in Dubai.

584
00:21:30,978 --> 00:21:32,878
- We arrived at the heart of Dubai. - Let's go.

585
00:21:32,978 --> 00:21:34,208
Let's go.

586
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,838
- This place is... Souk... - Souk...

587
00:21:37,878 --> 00:21:39,238
- Madinat... - Madinat...

588
00:21:39,308 --> 00:21:40,338
- Jumeirah. - Jumeirah.

589
00:21:40,408 --> 00:21:43,338
- Souk Madinat Jumeirah. - What is this place for?

590
00:21:43,878 --> 00:21:45,338
- It's a market. - What?

591
00:21:45,408 --> 00:21:47,878
- It's a traditional market. - It's a market.

592
00:21:48,338 --> 00:21:49,608
Look.

593
00:21:51,938 --> 00:21:52,978
It's very beautiful.

594
00:21:53,108 --> 00:21:59,978
(It's a stylish version of a traditional Dubai market.)

595
00:22:00,038 --> 00:22:07,678
(It's filled with traditional products, antiques and food.)

596
00:22:10,978 --> 00:22:12,678
- So it's here. - This is...

597
00:22:12,738 --> 00:22:14,678
Look, Seok Jin.

598
00:22:14,738 --> 00:22:17,338
You may not know well since you're still a rookie.

599
00:22:17,408 --> 00:22:18,508
You punk.

600
00:22:18,578 --> 00:22:19,608
(Jae Seok teases Seok Jin.)

601
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:20,878
Am I a rookie?

602
00:22:20,938 --> 00:22:22,878
You are less experienced than me.

603
00:22:22,978 --> 00:22:24,878
You became a comedian two years later than I did.

604
00:22:24,978 --> 00:22:26,608
- I did. - That's why I'm telling you this.

605
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,478
- Okay. - You must have no experience.

606
00:22:29,638 --> 00:22:32,408
- So I will guide you. - We did "Entertainment Weekly".

607
00:22:32,508 --> 00:22:33,838
We were on it together.

608
00:22:33,878 --> 00:22:34,878
- And you got fired. - He got fired...

609
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:37,578
- You got fired. - three weeks after I got fired.

610
00:22:38,408 --> 00:22:39,478
- Let's go inside. - Let's go.

611
00:22:39,508 --> 00:22:40,878
It's not on the outside,

612
00:22:40,978 --> 00:22:42,608
so you think it's inside.

613
00:22:42,678 --> 00:22:44,208
Like I said earlier,

614
00:22:44,608 --> 00:22:45,778
the temperature during the day...

615
00:22:46,308 --> 00:22:48,308
is perfect right now.

616
00:22:48,338 --> 00:22:50,878
- It's perfect. It's like summer. - It's...

617
00:22:50,978 --> 00:22:51,978
the perfect weather.

618
00:22:52,108 --> 00:22:53,838
It's much cooler than Korea's summer.

619
00:22:53,878 --> 00:22:56,808
- That's the weather. - You have to come to Dubai now.

620
00:22:56,838 --> 00:23:00,838
I am wearing three layers, but it's not too hot.

621
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:04,978
(They enter Souk Madinat Jumeirah.)

622
00:23:05,308 --> 00:23:07,208
- Is this the traditional market? - All right.

623
00:23:07,238 --> 00:23:09,038
How can a traditional market be so stylish?

624
00:23:10,308 --> 00:23:12,308
Please show the ceiling.

625
00:23:12,608 --> 00:23:15,108
It's gorgeous.

626
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:16,208
This is...

627
00:23:17,238 --> 00:23:19,938
- It looks very luxurious. - This place is...

628
00:23:19,978 --> 00:23:22,408
very luxurious for a traditional market.

629
00:23:23,608 --> 00:23:24,878
Those are so nice.

630
00:23:24,978 --> 00:23:25,978
(It's too beautiful to be a traditional market.)

631
00:23:26,308 --> 00:23:27,578
"Gold to go".

632
00:23:27,638 --> 00:23:29,408
That must be the gold vending machine.

633
00:23:30,608 --> 00:23:32,038
They said there was a gold vending machine here.

634
00:23:32,308 --> 00:23:34,778
- There really... - It's a gold vending machine.

635
00:23:34,838 --> 00:23:36,478
It must be a gold vending machine.

636
00:23:36,508 --> 00:23:37,508
- "Gold to go". - "Gold"...

637
00:23:37,608 --> 00:23:40,208
- "The gold ATM". - "Gold"...

638
00:23:40,238 --> 00:23:43,508
They have a gold vending machine here.

639
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:44,978
You swipe your credit card here.

640
00:23:45,108 --> 00:23:46,208
(Instead of drinks, there is gold.)

641
00:23:46,238 --> 00:23:48,108
- This is gold. - You can get gold from here.

642
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:49,638
This is a gold vending machine.

643
00:23:50,308 --> 00:23:51,308
"Gold to go".

644
00:23:51,338 --> 00:23:52,708
(They thought Ji Hyo was kidding.)

645
00:23:52,738 --> 00:23:54,408
- This is fascinating. - "The gold ATM".

646
00:23:54,778 --> 00:23:56,038
Ji Hyo was right.

647
00:23:56,408 --> 00:23:58,978
(What are Ji Hyo and Gary doing at this hour?)

648
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:01,608
I doubt it's going to be a legitimate desert.

649
00:24:01,678 --> 00:24:03,978
I doubt we have to...

650
00:24:04,108 --> 00:24:05,578
make a fire like in the old movies...

651
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:08,708
and sit with our backs together.

652
00:24:11,108 --> 00:24:13,138
(Ji Hyo is in deep sleep.)

653
00:24:14,778 --> 00:24:18,408
(Whom was he talking to?)

654
00:24:18,508 --> 00:24:19,838
Ji Hyo. Ji Hyo.

655
00:24:19,878 --> 00:24:22,038
Ji Hyo, there's the sea.

656
00:24:22,108 --> 00:24:23,208
There is the sea.

657
00:24:23,308 --> 00:24:24,638
There is the sea on our left.

658
00:24:25,138 --> 00:24:26,238
Wow, Gary!

659
00:24:26,308 --> 00:24:29,108
- That's amazing. - We are here.

660
00:24:30,838 --> 00:24:33,578
- Wow... - This is so nice.

661
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:34,708
(The golden beach and emerald sea are seen from afar.)

662
00:24:34,738 --> 00:24:36,308
Dubai is amazing.

663
00:24:39,308 --> 00:24:41,938
(Jumeirah Beach is one of the most beautiful beaches in Dubai.)

664
00:24:41,978 --> 00:24:43,238
Let's go look at the beach.

665
00:24:44,408 --> 00:24:45,508
Look at the boat over there.

666
00:24:45,578 --> 00:24:46,608
(Burj Al Arab can be seen from here.)

667
00:24:46,678 --> 00:24:49,238
- Even the boat looks nice. - It looks very nice.

668
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:50,678
(Burj Al Arab can be seen from here.)

669
00:24:50,678 --> 00:24:52,308
The water is so clean.

670
00:24:53,108 --> 00:24:54,138
This is crazy.

671
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:55,308
(Gary is amazed.)

672
00:24:55,338 --> 00:24:56,738
(Wow!)

673
00:24:57,408 --> 00:24:59,978
- Look at the water. - Look at the colour.

674
00:25:00,878 --> 00:25:03,408
(Photo time)

675
00:25:03,508 --> 00:25:04,738
- That should be the background. - Okay.

676
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:09,508
(They take a photo with Burj Al Arab and Jumeirah Beach.)

677
00:25:10,038 --> 00:25:11,608
(Are they on their honeymoon?)

678
00:25:13,738 --> 00:25:14,978
It looks amazing here.

679
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:16,938
It's the sea!

680
00:25:16,978 --> 00:25:18,608
We came to a beach in Dubai!

681
00:25:18,678 --> 00:25:20,108
Ji Hyo, you slept the whole time.

682
00:25:21,308 --> 00:25:22,708
(The view instantly wakes her up.)

683
00:25:22,738 --> 00:25:23,838
- Ji Hyo. - Look at this, Gary.

684
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:25,778
Isn't it beautiful?

685
00:25:26,808 --> 00:25:27,938
The clam shell looks like you.

686
00:25:27,978 --> 00:25:30,308
(The white clam shell is as beautiful as you.)

687
00:25:30,408 --> 00:25:32,578
The beach looks like you.

688
00:25:32,638 --> 00:25:34,308
(You're like the sea.)

689
00:25:34,338 --> 00:25:39,338
(Ji Hyo and Gary's hearts...)

690
00:25:39,408 --> 00:25:41,738
(start to pound slowly.)

691
00:25:42,238 --> 00:25:44,608
Ji Hyo, this is really nice!

692
00:25:44,678 --> 00:25:45,838
- Is it nice? - Yes!

693
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:49,108
I will go all the way there.

694
00:25:49,838 --> 00:25:52,978
(They are in Jumeirah Beach and Souk Madinat Jumeirah.)

695
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:54,508
(JBR Beach)

696
00:25:55,408 --> 00:25:56,408
(Where are Haha and Kwang Soo?)

697
00:25:56,508 --> 00:25:57,738
This is fantastic.

698
00:25:59,108 --> 00:26:00,208
- This is too pretty. - The weather is...

699
00:26:00,238 --> 00:26:02,108
- It's really pretty. - unbelievable.

700
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:05,508
- They scream luxury. - The buildings are...

701
00:26:05,578 --> 00:26:09,208
(The slim high-rises are exuding their charms.)

702
00:26:09,308 --> 00:26:10,578
Where is the beach?

703
00:26:10,638 --> 00:26:12,308
It's on the right.

704
00:26:13,408 --> 00:26:15,208
This is too beautiful.

705
00:26:15,308 --> 00:26:16,978
(Wow.)

706
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:20,838
- It's too beautiful. - The weather is amazing.

707
00:26:20,878 --> 00:26:22,408
(A beach can be seen in front of a concrete jungle.)

708
00:26:23,108 --> 00:26:24,838
This is too beautiful.

709
00:26:24,878 --> 00:26:26,808
- It's... - It's too beautiful.

710
00:26:26,838 --> 00:26:28,238
JDR.

711
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,708
- This is crazy. - This is...

712
00:26:30,738 --> 00:26:31,978
- Hey. - Hey.

713
00:26:32,108 --> 00:26:33,978
(It's an area where many foreigners reside.)

714
00:26:34,608 --> 00:26:35,938
This is freedom!

715
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:40,208
Kwang Soo, I am so happy. Really, I am so happy.

716
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:41,308
(They are in awe.)

717
00:26:41,338 --> 00:26:42,678
I'm glad we came here.

718
00:26:42,678 --> 00:26:46,338
(They are in awe.)

719
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,478
This is crazy.

720
00:26:48,638 --> 00:26:49,708
Don't look at them.

721
00:26:49,738 --> 00:26:50,938
- Pretend we're not tourists. - Act natural.

722
00:26:51,508 --> 00:26:52,578
Hi.

723
00:26:54,108 --> 00:26:55,208
- Hi. - Good morning.

724
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:56,308
(They are tourists.)

725
00:26:57,138 --> 00:26:58,938
We totally look like locals.

726
00:26:58,978 --> 00:27:00,638
(They can think whatever they want.)

727
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:01,708
Hi.

728
00:27:01,738 --> 00:27:02,738
(Kwang Soo greets the locals.)

729
00:27:03,108 --> 00:27:04,978
Kwang Soo, this is really crazy.

730
00:27:05,108 --> 00:27:06,108
(He continues to pretend to be a local.)

731
00:27:06,138 --> 00:27:07,838
(Wow.)

732
00:27:07,878 --> 00:27:08,878
This is a work of art.

733
00:27:08,978 --> 00:27:12,738
(It's as beautiful as art.)

734
00:27:13,678 --> 00:27:16,308
(Kwang Soo walks on the soft sand.

735
00:27:16,408 --> 00:27:18,708
(He looks at a girl in bikini.)

736
00:27:20,738 --> 00:27:24,408
(And he smiles.)

737
00:27:24,508 --> 00:27:27,138
(He wasn't expecting this, but he's loving it.)

738
00:27:28,478 --> 00:27:29,478
(He wanders around them.)

739
00:27:29,508 --> 00:27:30,608
Hi.

740
00:27:31,578 --> 00:27:33,608
(But they don't answer him back.)

741
00:27:35,138 --> 00:27:36,608
(They didn't hear me, right?)

742
00:27:36,678 --> 00:27:39,978
(Yes, that must be it.)

743
00:27:40,978 --> 00:27:43,638
- They recognise me in Dubai. - Really?

744
00:27:44,778 --> 00:27:45,778
Do you know me?

745
00:27:45,838 --> 00:27:47,138
(She nods.)

746
00:27:47,778 --> 00:27:49,408
- Say my name. - Haha.

747
00:27:49,478 --> 00:27:51,338
(She recognises Haha.)

748
00:27:51,508 --> 00:27:52,608
How do you know me?

749
00:27:52,678 --> 00:27:53,978
(We can tell that she's a big fan of Haha.)

750
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:55,138
She likes me a lot.

751
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:58,108
- Do you know us? - Yes, I know you.

752
00:27:58,738 --> 00:28:00,508
I can speak a little Korean.

753
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,208
- Are you from Dubai? - Yes, I am from Dubai.

754
00:28:02,238 --> 00:28:04,208
They watch Running Man in Dubai? Do you watch...

755
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:05,678
- Yes. It's number one. - Running Man?

756
00:28:05,738 --> 00:28:06,978
- Is it number one? - It's number one.

757
00:28:07,108 --> 00:28:08,238
Oh my gosh!

758
00:28:10,878 --> 00:28:12,678
- Where are you from? - Dubai.

759
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:14,138
Dubai? Really?

760
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,308
She said our show ranks first place here.

761
00:28:17,108 --> 00:28:18,838
Nice to meet you. Can I shake her hand?

762
00:28:18,878 --> 00:28:19,878
Nice to meet you.

763
00:28:20,308 --> 00:28:21,308
High-five!

764
00:28:22,308 --> 00:28:24,308
- Hurry. - Do you want a picture?

765
00:28:24,408 --> 00:28:25,408
Thank you.

766
00:28:25,878 --> 00:28:26,938
Oh my gosh...

767
00:28:27,738 --> 00:28:30,978
(They take a photo together.)

768
00:28:31,108 --> 00:28:32,108
Give me five dollars.

769
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:33,478
(Haha asks her for 5 dollars.)

770
00:28:33,508 --> 00:28:34,878
(He's kidding.)

771
00:28:34,978 --> 00:28:36,638
- Just kidding. - Just kidding.

772
00:28:36,708 --> 00:28:38,678
(They gave a Dubai fan a great laugh.)

773
00:28:38,738 --> 00:28:39,878
Okay. See you.

774
00:28:40,508 --> 00:28:42,508
- Bye. Thank you. - Thank you. Bye.

775
00:28:44,438 --> 00:28:45,978
This place is too nice.

776
00:28:46,108 --> 00:28:47,138
(JBR Beach is the best place to relax.)

777
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:48,308
What do we do?

778
00:28:48,408 --> 00:28:50,778
The weather and everything...

779
00:28:50,838 --> 00:28:53,638
Hey, there's a flag over there! There's a flag in the middle...

780
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:55,408
- There is a flag. - Oh, a flag!

781
00:28:55,478 --> 00:28:56,838
- It came out of nowhere. - That was unexpected.

782
00:28:56,878 --> 00:28:57,978
I'm so embarrassed.

783
00:28:58,038 --> 00:29:00,108
- How could you put them here? - Wait.

784
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:01,638
Tell them to take them out.

785
00:29:01,938 --> 00:29:04,208
- I'm so embarrassed. - We looked totally like locals.

786
00:29:04,308 --> 00:29:06,408
I am seriously in love with this place.

787
00:29:06,508 --> 00:29:08,238
Gosh, I am so happy.

788
00:29:08,308 --> 00:29:09,938
They must be shooting something. There are cameras.

789
00:29:09,978 --> 00:29:11,508
- Are you shooting something? - Is something going on?

790
00:29:11,508 --> 00:29:12,508
They're shooting something.

791
00:29:12,878 --> 00:29:14,138
We're just on a trip here.

792
00:29:15,408 --> 00:29:16,478
(Are you really going to ignore us?)

793
00:29:16,508 --> 00:29:17,708
- Please draw the cameras off. - Please.

794
00:29:17,978 --> 00:29:20,108
Please shoot from a distant.

795
00:29:20,938 --> 00:29:22,608
What would these free people think about us?

796
00:29:22,708 --> 00:29:25,508
Look how relaxed the people here are.

797
00:29:26,478 --> 00:29:27,878
- Right? - We'd look strange to them.

798
00:29:27,978 --> 00:29:29,508
Someone's even jogging. Hi.

799
00:29:29,508 --> 00:29:30,978
- Hi. - She looks very healthy.

800
00:29:31,108 --> 00:29:32,108
You can do it.

801
00:29:32,138 --> 00:29:34,108
Look at their bright smiles.

802
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:36,508
- Right. - No one seems to be angry here.

803
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:38,308
- Hi, brother. - Hi.

804
00:29:38,338 --> 00:29:39,878
(They greet each other so naturally.)

805
00:29:39,938 --> 00:29:41,238
- High-five? - High-five.

806
00:29:41,478 --> 00:29:42,508
- Bye. - Bye.

807
00:29:43,238 --> 00:29:44,978
You look like a local here.

808
00:29:45,608 --> 00:29:46,708
(I'm a true Dubaian.)

809
00:29:46,808 --> 00:29:47,838
You're a local!

810
00:29:49,108 --> 00:29:50,708
I am so happy now.

811
00:29:51,108 --> 00:29:53,978
- We have two flags here. - Yes.

812
00:29:54,308 --> 00:29:56,238
You have two games to choose from.

813
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:57,608
Just choose one of them.

814
00:29:57,638 --> 00:30:00,608
We'll start with the game with one star.

815
00:30:00,608 --> 00:30:03,878
This game, with one stamp, is called "Gestures".

816
00:30:04,238 --> 00:30:06,338
Describe the given words with your body gestures to foreigners,

817
00:30:06,508 --> 00:30:09,308
and if they get 7 correct answers in 90 seconds, you succeed.

818
00:30:09,338 --> 00:30:10,778
- Seven questions? - In 90 seconds?

819
00:30:10,838 --> 00:30:12,338
Please find a person to play with...

820
00:30:12,408 --> 00:30:14,778
and bring him or her here. Then we'll start the game.

821
00:30:15,408 --> 00:30:16,438
Please go first.

822
00:30:16,508 --> 00:30:18,108
(This must be difficult.)

823
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:20,878
Can you play a game with me?

824
00:30:21,608 --> 00:30:22,778
Can you play a game with me?

825
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:24,338
- Do you have time? - Time?

826
00:30:24,438 --> 00:30:25,438
Let's play a game.

827
00:30:26,978 --> 00:30:29,238
- Okay. What's your name? - Gosh.

828
00:30:29,308 --> 00:30:30,608
- What's your name? Andy? - Andy.

829
00:30:30,708 --> 00:30:32,238
- Where are you from? - I'm from Italy.

830
00:30:32,308 --> 00:30:33,608
Italy. Wow.

831
00:30:33,608 --> 00:30:34,938
You're revealing too much.

832
00:30:34,978 --> 00:30:35,978
Oh, you're from Italy.

833
00:30:36,308 --> 00:30:38,708
("Gestures" with this Italian man starts now.)

834
00:30:38,778 --> 00:30:39,778
Way to go!

835
00:30:40,878 --> 00:30:41,878
Get ready and...

836
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:43,508
start.

837
00:30:44,708 --> 00:30:46,108
(He's bewildered.)

838
00:30:46,138 --> 00:30:47,708
How should I describe a sloth?

839
00:30:48,608 --> 00:30:50,508
(He moves onto the next question.)

840
00:30:50,508 --> 00:30:52,038
- Penguin. - Yes, it is penguin.

841
00:30:52,108 --> 00:30:53,478
- Yes! - Hamster?

842
00:30:54,108 --> 00:30:55,978
It's like a mouse.

843
00:30:56,038 --> 00:30:57,708
What are you doing?

844
00:30:57,778 --> 00:30:58,778
What is that?

845
00:30:58,838 --> 00:31:02,038
This sounds like this.

846
00:31:02,108 --> 00:31:03,308
I like "hams".

847
00:31:03,338 --> 00:31:04,478
- It's a tiger. - I like "hams".

848
00:31:04,508 --> 00:31:05,778
Tiger? Tiger?

849
00:31:05,878 --> 00:31:07,238
- No! - It's a lion then, a lion.

850
00:31:07,308 --> 00:31:08,708
- Lion. - No!

851
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:10,508
I like "hams".

852
00:31:10,508 --> 00:31:12,478
- It must be puma. - Puma.

853
00:31:12,608 --> 00:31:13,608
It's a puma. Yes!

854
00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:15,408
- No! - Yes!

855
00:31:15,478 --> 00:31:16,708
(He was tricked by Haha.)

856
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,708
No.

857
00:31:18,508 --> 00:31:19,508
It's a gorilla.

858
00:31:20,238 --> 00:31:21,778
You just said the answer.

859
00:31:21,878 --> 00:31:23,408
- It's gorilla in English, too. - Gorilla is English.

860
00:31:23,478 --> 00:31:24,508
I got it. Okay.

861
00:31:24,608 --> 00:31:26,708
- Start. - Gary looks like this.

862
00:31:26,808 --> 00:31:28,108
(Gary looks just like this.)

863
00:31:29,338 --> 00:31:33,708
(Would he know Gary's nickname?)

864
00:31:33,778 --> 00:31:34,878
Gary and this look similar.

865
00:31:34,978 --> 00:31:36,778
(Gary looks just like this.)

866
00:31:36,878 --> 00:31:39,208
- Kangaroo. - It's a squid.

867
00:31:39,238 --> 00:31:41,138
- Kangaroo. - No, that's not it...

868
00:31:41,238 --> 00:31:44,208
It has 12 legs.

869
00:31:44,438 --> 00:31:45,478
- It has 13 legs. - That is not...

870
00:31:45,508 --> 00:31:46,708
It has 30 legs!

871
00:31:46,808 --> 00:31:48,608
There's no animal like that.

872
00:31:49,308 --> 00:31:51,208
- 30 legs? - It has a square-shaped head.

873
00:31:51,238 --> 00:31:53,438
- Monster. - No, it's not a monster.

874
00:31:53,508 --> 00:31:55,338
- It has square-shaped head. - It's a webfoot octopus.

875
00:31:55,408 --> 00:31:57,708
- Webfoot octopus! - Webfoot octopus?

876
00:31:57,778 --> 00:31:58,778
No, that's not it!

877
00:31:58,878 --> 00:32:00,508
- The answer isn't webfoot octopus. - Webfoot octopus.

878
00:32:00,938 --> 00:32:02,038
Webfoot octopus!

879
00:32:02,478 --> 00:32:03,608
Thank you.

880
00:32:03,708 --> 00:32:04,708
Webfoot octopus.

881
00:32:04,778 --> 00:32:05,778
(Mission failed.)

882
00:32:05,878 --> 00:32:07,508
- Thank you. - Webfoot octopus...

883
00:32:07,608 --> 00:32:09,138
- Wow. - You're hilarious.

884
00:32:09,238 --> 00:32:12,338
I feel strange to hear a foreigner say "webfoot octopus" in Korean.

885
00:32:12,608 --> 00:32:14,338
How would you describe squid with your body?

886
00:32:14,408 --> 00:32:15,408
Squid?

887
00:32:16,108 --> 00:32:17,608
- You got it. - What?

888
00:32:17,938 --> 00:32:19,708
- Yes, good. - Is that different from this?

889
00:32:19,708 --> 00:32:22,108
- That's a webfoot octopus. - Webfoot octopus?

890
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:23,338
(Kwang Soo, what you're describing is closer to a webfoot octopus.)

891
00:32:23,878 --> 00:32:25,108
(JBR Beach)

892
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:28,438
(Souk Madinat Jumeirah)

893
00:32:29,708 --> 00:32:30,708
What is that?

894
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:32,978
This is amazing.

895
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:35,708
- What a nice view. - Wow, what is that?

896
00:32:35,778 --> 00:32:37,238
(What are they looking at?)

897
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:39,408
This place has a great view.

898
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,208
I like it here.

899
00:32:41,978 --> 00:32:43,508
- Look at that boat. - Wow, look.

900
00:32:43,608 --> 00:32:44,938
I want to ride that.

901
00:32:45,878 --> 00:32:46,978
This place is fantastic.

902
00:32:47,878 --> 00:32:49,438
(What mission would they have to clear in such a pleasurable place?)

903
00:32:49,508 --> 00:32:50,508
Come look at this.

904
00:32:50,608 --> 00:32:52,838
- What's that? - There's the R flag.

905
00:32:53,608 --> 00:32:55,308
(They find the R flag near the Abra dock.)

906
00:32:55,338 --> 00:32:56,978
- Okay. - What is that?

907
00:32:57,108 --> 00:33:00,508
- This is Souk Madinat Jumeirah. - Okay.

908
00:33:01,108 --> 00:33:05,478
This is a water transportation called "abra ride".

909
00:33:05,508 --> 00:33:07,038
- Do people really ride them? - Yes.

910
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:10,508
Why don't you ride it and...

911
00:33:10,778 --> 00:33:11,878
- take a look around. - Really?

912
00:33:11,978 --> 00:33:13,708
- Can we get on now? - Okay.

913
00:33:14,708 --> 00:33:15,878
- Hi. - How are you?

914
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:18,878
- I'm fine. - I'm fine, thank you. And you?

915
00:33:19,838 --> 00:33:22,138
- Thank you. - You speak English very naturally.

916
00:33:22,238 --> 00:33:23,508
We can answer this automatically.

917
00:33:23,608 --> 00:33:25,208
- We must be able to say this. - I'm fine, thank you. And you?

918
00:33:25,708 --> 00:33:26,978
So do we sit here?

919
00:33:27,108 --> 00:33:28,108
Yes, we sit here.

920
00:33:28,608 --> 00:33:30,608
I like this a lot.

921
00:33:30,838 --> 00:33:32,708
How fast would this go?

922
00:33:32,978 --> 00:33:34,708
(Jae Seok burst into laughter.)

923
00:33:35,238 --> 00:33:37,978
He has never been a reporter in other countries.

924
00:33:38,608 --> 00:33:41,878
He doesn't know what to say when he's shooting outside like this.

925
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:43,208
You sound awkward.

926
00:33:43,238 --> 00:33:45,438
Have you been reporting in other countries then?

927
00:33:45,508 --> 00:33:47,978
Have you? You've never done it either.

928
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:49,838
Tell me if you have.

929
00:33:50,338 --> 00:33:51,338
Oh my goodness.

930
00:33:51,578 --> 00:33:52,938
- You're so funny. - This place is very nice.

931
00:33:52,978 --> 00:33:53,978
Hi!

932
00:33:56,338 --> 00:33:58,208
What a beautiful family!

933
00:33:58,308 --> 00:33:59,778
The family looks beautiful.

934
00:33:59,878 --> 00:34:02,708
- The kids are very cute. - They are cute.

935
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:04,938
How could they all have blond hair?

936
00:34:05,138 --> 00:34:07,508
The kids are blond because their mother is blond.

937
00:34:07,608 --> 00:34:10,108
It's because their mother is blond. Haven't you learned about genes?

938
00:34:10,138 --> 00:34:13,108
Seok Jin, this is what reporters do.

939
00:34:13,138 --> 00:34:14,608
- Reporters should mention... - All right.

940
00:34:14,708 --> 00:34:15,878
- things like this. - Their parents are blond, so...

941
00:34:15,938 --> 00:34:18,608
- their children are blond, too. - Gosh.

942
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:20,838
What's our mission today? Is it riding this abra ride?

943
00:34:21,238 --> 00:34:22,708
Isn't it too easy?

944
00:34:22,778 --> 00:34:24,238
- This place is... - This place is so beautiful.

945
00:34:24,338 --> 00:34:26,108
Look at this emerald ocean.

946
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:28,678
(They ride along the emerald ocean.)

947
00:34:28,708 --> 00:34:30,708
- They're having lunch there. - They're eating.

948
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:32,338
(People are having lunch near this fantastic emerald ocean.)

949
00:34:32,408 --> 00:34:33,838
It's so fabulous.

950
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:35,978
This place is...

951
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,778
so great.

952
00:34:39,108 --> 00:34:40,708
These buildings are all hotels.

953
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:41,778
(They pass under a bridge.)

954
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:46,508
I never thought Running Man would let us relax like this.

955
00:34:46,608 --> 00:34:47,608
- Right. - Thank you.

956
00:34:47,708 --> 00:34:49,478
I love travelling freely like this.

957
00:34:49,508 --> 00:34:51,708
- I really enjoy this freedom. - Right.

958
00:34:52,338 --> 00:34:53,878
The water is so clear.

959
00:34:54,438 --> 00:34:56,408
I can see the bottom. It's very clean.

960
00:34:56,478 --> 00:34:57,978
This is sea water.

961
00:34:58,108 --> 00:34:59,708
- No. - This is sea water, Seok Jin.

962
00:34:59,778 --> 00:35:01,138
How could this be sea water?

963
00:35:01,238 --> 00:35:02,238
Then drink some.

964
00:35:03,108 --> 00:35:04,238
It must be salty.

965
00:35:04,308 --> 00:35:06,708
Everyone, I'll taste this water...

966
00:35:07,048 --> 00:35:09,338
to see if this is sea water or not.

967
00:35:09,408 --> 00:35:10,838
Let's play the rock-paper-scissors.

968
00:35:10,878 --> 00:35:12,878
- The one who loses... - I bet you want to find out...

969
00:35:13,108 --> 00:35:15,208
- if this is sea water or not. - Is this sea water or...

970
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,508
- lake water? - We'll try this water and see...

971
00:35:17,608 --> 00:35:19,138
if it's sea water or not.

972
00:35:19,238 --> 00:35:20,508
- Rock, paper and scissors. - Rock, paper and scissors.

973
00:35:20,608 --> 00:35:21,608
(Who will taste it?)

974
00:35:21,608 --> 00:35:22,778
I lost.

975
00:35:23,408 --> 00:35:25,978
I lost, so I'll taste it.

976
00:35:26,508 --> 00:35:28,778
We always keep our words.

977
00:35:28,878 --> 00:35:30,408
- Try it. - You shouldn't doubt me.

978
00:35:30,478 --> 00:35:31,708
- Hurry. - Okay.

979
00:35:32,408 --> 00:35:33,408
Here I go.

980
00:35:33,508 --> 00:35:35,238
(Seok Jin licks his fingers.)

981
00:35:35,308 --> 00:35:36,338
It is salty!

982
00:35:36,408 --> 00:35:38,308
(It is salty.)

983
00:35:38,338 --> 00:35:40,508
- See? - It's salty, so it is sea water.

984
00:35:40,608 --> 00:35:42,508
- I told you. - It is salty.

985
00:35:42,608 --> 00:35:43,878
This water comes from the ocean.

986
00:35:43,938 --> 00:35:45,308
It is really salty.

987
00:35:45,408 --> 00:35:46,508
Is it really sea water?

988
00:35:47,308 --> 00:35:48,638
Of course, it is.

989
00:35:50,308 --> 00:35:51,338
What's our mission today?

990
00:35:51,408 --> 00:35:52,408
I see nothing from here.

991
00:35:53,408 --> 00:35:54,878
I see nothing either.

992
00:35:55,508 --> 00:35:56,508
Come on.

993
00:35:56,608 --> 00:35:59,608
I don't see anything from here. What's our mission today?

994
00:36:02,238 --> 00:36:03,508
We were here before.

995
00:36:05,478 --> 00:36:06,608
That is where we started.

996
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:08,508
(The ride came back to the dock.)

997
00:36:08,508 --> 00:36:10,338
What's the mission? I saw nothing.

998
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:13,108
We're already back where we started.

999
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:19,608
- Thank you. - Thank you, boss.

1000
00:36:19,608 --> 00:36:21,238
I feel like we've already failed our mission.

1001
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:22,878
- I have no clue. - What is it?

1002
00:36:22,938 --> 00:36:24,108
What is our mission today?

1003
00:36:24,408 --> 00:36:26,238
- Here comes the question. - Okay.

1004
00:36:26,338 --> 00:36:27,778
(They are given a question.)

1005
00:36:27,878 --> 00:36:29,778
While you were riding the ride,

1006
00:36:30,508 --> 00:36:34,108
how many bridges did you pass?

1007
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,108
(How many bridges did they pass?)

1008
00:36:35,708 --> 00:36:36,778
This is ridiculous.

1009
00:36:37,608 --> 00:36:39,108
- Isn't that too much? - Bridges?

1010
00:36:39,478 --> 00:36:41,208
- You passed under the bridges. - Right.

1011
00:36:41,238 --> 00:36:43,048
So how many of them did you pass?

1012
00:36:43,108 --> 00:36:44,238
(We surely passed through bridges...)

1013
00:36:44,338 --> 00:36:46,338
I'll just say any number that comes to my mind.

1014
00:36:46,408 --> 00:36:47,408
Jae Seok and I will say the number separately.

1015
00:36:47,478 --> 00:36:48,708
Please whisper the number to us.

1016
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:49,878
We should just make a guess.

1017
00:36:49,938 --> 00:36:50,978
(We have no choice but to just guess.)

1018
00:36:51,708 --> 00:36:52,708
(Seok Jin whispers.)

1019
00:36:55,108 --> 00:36:56,708
(Seok Jin's answer is 6.)

1020
00:36:57,508 --> 00:36:58,978
(What is Jae Seok's number?)

1021
00:36:59,048 --> 00:37:00,338
(Now, Jae Seok whispers.)

1022
00:37:01,338 --> 00:37:02,338
Why are you asking me how many there were?

1023
00:37:02,438 --> 00:37:03,778
Why are you asking him for an answer??

1024
00:37:04,238 --> 00:37:05,238
Why are you asking...

1025
00:37:05,478 --> 00:37:06,708
Gosh.

1026
00:37:06,708 --> 00:37:08,338
- Hey, give me another chance. - Please.

1027
00:37:08,408 --> 00:37:10,338
Let me say it again.

1028
00:37:10,438 --> 00:37:11,778
- Give me another chance. - Please.

1029
00:37:11,878 --> 00:37:13,438
Let's move on to the next flag.

1030
00:37:13,508 --> 00:37:14,878
- How many were there? - This is driving me crazy.

1031
00:37:14,938 --> 00:37:16,138
Were there 7? Or 8?

1032
00:37:16,238 --> 00:37:18,108
(How many bridges did they pass?)

1033
00:37:18,878 --> 00:37:21,238
What's the mission today? Do we just need to ride this?

1034
00:37:21,608 --> 00:37:23,208
Isn't it too easy?

1035
00:37:23,238 --> 00:37:24,608
Seok Jin, I love this place.

1036
00:37:25,108 --> 00:37:26,708
It's so beautiful here.

1037
00:37:26,708 --> 00:37:27,708
(The answer is 7.)

1038
00:37:28,438 --> 00:37:29,508
(Frustrated)

1039
00:37:29,508 --> 00:37:30,978
This is such a ridiculous mission.

1040
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:32,608
How would we possibly know that?

1041
00:37:32,778 --> 00:37:34,338
You took us to this beautiful place and...

1042
00:37:34,408 --> 00:37:36,808
- True. We never expected this. - It's ridiculous.

1043
00:37:37,208 --> 00:37:38,208
Gosh.

1044
00:37:38,438 --> 00:37:41,878
Isn't the question a total nonsense?

1045
00:37:41,938 --> 00:37:43,238
(They can't believe it.)

1046
00:37:43,338 --> 00:37:45,438
The question was seriously nonsense.

1047
00:37:45,508 --> 00:37:46,978
I think you went too far.

1048
00:37:47,508 --> 00:37:52,838
(Angry Jae Seok and Seok Jin move on to the next mission.)

1049
00:37:53,508 --> 00:37:56,238
Measure your height and weight, and then bring the consent form.

1050
00:37:56,338 --> 00:37:57,438
(These three people who chose skydiving...)

1051
00:37:57,508 --> 00:38:02,508
(measure their heights and weights to ensure their safety.)

1052
00:38:08,048 --> 00:38:09,048
Is this right?

1053
00:38:09,508 --> 00:38:10,608
What is this?

1054
00:38:10,608 --> 00:38:11,778
(Her weight has been disclosed to everyone.)

1055
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:12,838
Oh my goodness.

1056
00:38:17,708 --> 00:38:20,408
Just so you know, I went on the scale...

1057
00:38:20,478 --> 00:38:22,208
- with all my clothes on. - You even had your mic on.

1058
00:38:23,238 --> 00:38:24,438
And I even had the mic on me.

1059
00:38:24,508 --> 00:38:25,778
(No one said anything about you.)

1060
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:30,238
(She becomes even more nervous after the physical examination.)

1061
00:38:30,338 --> 00:38:31,708
(She holds her hands tightly.)

1062
00:38:31,778 --> 00:38:33,238
You are not praying, are you?

1063
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:34,978
You look like you're praying.

1064
00:38:35,108 --> 00:38:36,838
(Trembling)

1065
00:38:38,138 --> 00:38:40,238
I held my hands so tightly that my fingers are numb.

1066
00:38:41,238 --> 00:38:43,208
(Sighing)

1067
00:38:43,978 --> 00:38:45,508
I can't do this.

1068
00:38:45,508 --> 00:38:47,108
I'm leaving. I can't do it.

1069
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:48,878
Don't you think I should give up?

1070
00:38:48,978 --> 00:38:51,238
- Why? - I'm really scared.

1071
00:38:51,338 --> 00:38:52,978
I'm scared. I think I'm going to go crazy.

1072
00:38:53,048 --> 00:38:54,308
Gosh, that hurt.

1073
00:38:54,338 --> 00:38:55,708
(She bumps her bottom.)

1074
00:38:57,338 --> 00:38:59,878
Gosh. I'm out of my mind.

1075
00:39:00,708 --> 00:39:07,508
(Da Hey is panicking. Will she be able to skydive?)

1076
00:39:08,708 --> 00:39:09,708
I'm going insane.

1077
00:39:10,138 --> 00:39:11,138
Okay.

1078
00:39:11,438 --> 00:39:14,108
(Meanwhile, Jong Kook is putting on his gear.)

1079
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:22,238
Yes. Perfect. And chin up. You will be flying forward.

1080
00:39:22,738 --> 00:39:24,838
Are you all right? So, we'll do something like that.

1081
00:39:25,408 --> 00:39:28,238
- Does it sound like fun? Ready? - Yes.

1082
00:39:28,238 --> 00:39:30,878
High-five. Let's go skydive.

1083
00:39:30,978 --> 00:39:32,548
(Jong Kook, Il Woo and Da Hey are all ready.)

1084
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:36,138
(They take a photo before taking off.)

1085
00:39:37,338 --> 00:39:40,838
(Although I look like I'm smiling, I'm not really smiling inside.)

1086
00:39:41,138 --> 00:39:42,208
Oh, goodness.

1087
00:39:42,638 --> 00:39:43,838
Oh, my.

1088
00:39:44,338 --> 00:39:46,238
- But I think you can do it. - Okay.

1089
00:39:47,108 --> 00:39:48,338
But why are my hands trembling?

1090
00:39:49,138 --> 00:39:50,548
My hands are trembling. Really.

1091
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:51,738
It would be strange not to tremble.

1092
00:39:51,778 --> 00:39:54,438
If you succeed this mission, you will receive 10 stamps.

1093
00:39:54,548 --> 00:39:55,738
If you succeed,

1094
00:39:55,778 --> 00:39:57,738
you will not receive a penalty.

1095
00:39:57,838 --> 00:39:59,938
(If they succeed, they will sleep at the finest desert hotel tonight.)

1096
00:40:00,048 --> 00:40:02,548
Please keep in mind that you will go in 10 minutes.

1097
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:05,208
If you step out that door,

1098
00:40:06,408 --> 00:40:07,938
we can't take the cameras with us.

1099
00:40:07,978 --> 00:40:09,338
- So are we on our own? - Yes.

1100
00:40:09,438 --> 00:40:10,978
(They have to overcome this on their own.)

1101
00:40:11,048 --> 00:40:12,308
Are we on our own?

1102
00:40:14,138 --> 00:40:15,408
They say it's an altitude of 3,962m.

1103
00:40:15,438 --> 00:40:16,638
- What? - What?

1104
00:40:16,808 --> 00:40:23,338
(What? 3,926m?)

1105
00:40:23,438 --> 00:40:25,438
- No, they told us it's 1,219m. - They told us it's 1,219m.

1106
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:28,048
No, it's from 3,926m to 4,267m.

1107
00:40:28,108 --> 00:40:29,638
- What? - Well,

1108
00:40:29,638 --> 00:40:32,108
- 3000m is not that high. - That's impossible.

1109
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,838
My face is getting hot.

1110
00:40:34,408 --> 00:40:36,938
- It needs to be at least 3,962m. - We must have heard it wrong.

1111
00:40:36,978 --> 00:40:39,138
- Did we hear him wrong? - Was it really 4,267m?

1112
00:40:39,238 --> 00:40:40,238
- We must've heard him wrong. - I think so.

1113
00:40:40,338 --> 00:40:45,308
(They will go higher than Mount Baekdu which is 2,744m tall.)

1114
00:40:45,638 --> 00:40:47,438
- It's 3,962m. - 3,962m?

1115
00:40:47,548 --> 00:40:49,408
(It's too late to change missions.)

1116
00:40:49,438 --> 00:40:52,108
(Wailing)

1117
00:40:53,638 --> 00:40:55,548
- What should I do? - We'll be okay.

1118
00:40:55,548 --> 00:40:56,838
(She's lost for words.)

1119
00:40:56,938 --> 00:40:59,408
Really. This is going to be difficult.

1120
00:40:59,438 --> 00:41:00,738
(Jong Kook and Il Woo are nervous, too.)

1121
00:41:00,838 --> 00:41:03,208
If you can give up now we will...

1122
00:41:03,408 --> 00:41:05,308
I'm nervous, but I want to do this.

1123
00:41:06,308 --> 00:41:07,978
- I'm nervous. - We'll give you one last chance...

1124
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:10,138
- to change your mind. - Will there be...

1125
00:41:10,638 --> 00:41:12,408
a pressure that is unbearable?

1126
00:41:12,438 --> 00:41:13,548
It differs for every person.

1127
00:41:13,548 --> 00:41:15,138
(Not everyone will feel the same.)

1128
00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:17,138
I think it'll be scary only when you jump.

1129
00:41:18,438 --> 00:41:20,438
- If we change our minds... - The phones are over there.

1130
00:41:20,638 --> 00:41:21,938
They say we can change our minds.

1131
00:41:22,308 --> 00:41:23,638
This is my last chance.

1132
00:41:23,738 --> 00:41:27,938
(It's her last chance to back out.)

1133
00:41:28,238 --> 00:41:31,838
(Will she be able to do this?)

1134
00:41:33,338 --> 00:41:36,938
(It's an opportunity to avoid sleeping out in the desert.)

1135
00:41:36,938 --> 00:41:40,878
(But in order to do so, they need to jump from 3,962m.)

1136
00:41:41,738 --> 00:41:45,638
(What decision will she make?)

1137
00:41:45,738 --> 00:41:46,878
No.

1138
00:41:47,048 --> 00:41:48,338
No. No.

1139
00:41:48,408 --> 00:41:50,338
Da Hey keeps talking to herself.

1140
00:41:50,978 --> 00:41:52,238
She's talking to herself.

1141
00:41:52,548 --> 00:41:53,638
If you make a decision,

1142
00:41:53,738 --> 00:41:55,438
- you should go with it. - You're right.

1143
00:41:55,738 --> 00:41:57,638
(I'm a woman of my word.)

1144
00:41:57,638 --> 00:41:58,738
No.

1145
00:42:00,138 --> 00:42:03,108
(Although he doesn't show it, Jong Kook is very nervous, too.)

1146
00:42:03,138 --> 00:42:04,778
This is insane. I'm wordless.

1147
00:42:05,878 --> 00:42:09,938
(I should have chosen an easier mission.)

1148
00:42:11,548 --> 00:42:14,638
(Here's a person who's free from worldly cares.)

1149
00:42:14,838 --> 00:42:16,238
(This is great.)

1150
00:42:17,338 --> 00:42:25,048
(Gary and Ji Hyo are still acting like the lovely Monday Couple.)

1151
00:42:26,838 --> 00:42:29,778
(They are having fun under the warm sun.)

1152
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:31,638
Good luck!

1153
00:42:34,048 --> 00:42:36,338
(If they move enough sand, they will win.)

1154
00:42:36,408 --> 00:42:37,438
Go, go!

1155
00:42:38,548 --> 00:42:39,548
Okay!

1156
00:42:42,308 --> 00:42:45,338
(Oh, no. The basket tipped over.)

1157
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:46,808
(Oh, no, Gary!)

1158
00:42:47,438 --> 00:42:48,548
Okay!

1159
00:42:49,638 --> 00:42:51,938
(It's not okay...)

1160
00:42:52,978 --> 00:42:54,138
Okay.

1161
00:42:55,978 --> 00:42:56,978
What is this?

1162
00:42:57,978 --> 00:43:00,438
(Team Gary wasted 20 seconds.)

1163
00:43:02,208 --> 00:43:03,548
(He misses.)

1164
00:43:06,108 --> 00:43:07,438
Hurry up. Hurry up. Faster!

1165
00:43:09,308 --> 00:43:10,438
Pour it!

1166
00:43:11,048 --> 00:43:14,208
(They have less than 30 seconds. They need to hurry.)

1167
00:43:15,778 --> 00:43:16,838
Give me more.

1168
00:43:18,548 --> 00:43:19,548
(He misses again.)

1169
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:20,838
Good!

1170
00:43:21,238 --> 00:43:22,238
Let's do this!

1171
00:43:24,238 --> 00:43:25,308
Pour the sand!

1172
00:43:26,308 --> 00:43:29,938
(Please hold on.)

1173
00:43:30,778 --> 00:43:32,238
(I didn't come here to do hard labour.)

1174
00:43:33,238 --> 00:43:34,638
(Go, Gary.)

1175
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:38,238
(They have about 10 seconds left, but the bucket isn't full yet.)

1176
00:43:38,338 --> 00:43:39,838
Quickly! Quickly!

1177
00:43:40,038 --> 00:43:43,838
(It's a close game. They need to hurry.)

1178
00:43:47,438 --> 00:43:48,638
We're going to make it for sure.

1179
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:51,038
- We did it. - Finished!

1180
00:43:51,508 --> 00:43:53,138
Oh, my goodness!

1181
00:43:53,738 --> 00:43:54,878
Good job.

1182
00:43:54,938 --> 00:43:56,038
(Gary succeeds!)

1183
00:43:56,138 --> 00:43:57,238
I'm sorry!

1184
00:43:57,878 --> 00:43:59,938
- Thank you so much! - You're welcome.

1185
00:44:00,438 --> 00:44:01,838
(Gary earns 2 stamps.)

1186
00:44:01,878 --> 00:44:04,138
We've come all the way here. I need to do something.

1187
00:44:04,438 --> 00:44:05,538
What is this?

1188
00:44:06,108 --> 00:44:07,138
I'll begin.

1189
00:44:07,208 --> 00:44:09,238
(They need to squeeze water out of this wet towel in order to win.)

1190
00:44:09,338 --> 00:44:10,438
Oh, my.

1191
00:44:10,638 --> 00:44:13,438
(She is doing the mission with a newlywed bride.)

1192
00:44:15,138 --> 00:44:16,208
Here.

1193
00:44:20,438 --> 00:44:21,508
You're doing great.

1194
00:44:22,438 --> 00:44:23,638
Hurry, hurry!

1195
00:44:24,638 --> 00:44:25,738
They're doing great.

1196
00:44:26,438 --> 00:44:27,938
(I don't think we'll need a washing machine.)

1197
00:44:31,508 --> 00:44:32,638
I don't think I'll be able to do this.

1198
00:44:32,838 --> 00:44:34,978
(They squeeze it until the last drop.)

1199
00:44:35,038 --> 00:44:37,038
- I'm so tired! - That's enough.

1200
00:44:37,538 --> 00:44:38,538
You won.

1201
00:44:43,238 --> 00:44:44,238
You have succeeded.

1202
00:44:44,338 --> 00:44:45,338
(Ji Hyo succeeds!)

1203
00:44:45,408 --> 00:44:47,408
(Thanks to the newlywed bride)

1204
00:44:47,438 --> 00:44:48,538
Thank you.

1205
00:44:49,438 --> 00:44:50,538
How could you...

1206
00:44:50,638 --> 00:44:51,738
do this to a newlywed?

1207
00:44:52,438 --> 00:44:55,238
I think you should just go to sleep tonight.

1208
00:44:55,308 --> 00:44:56,438
(She used all her energy.)

1209
00:44:56,538 --> 00:44:57,778
- Have a great honeymoon. - Thank you.

1210
00:44:57,838 --> 00:44:58,978
Take care of yourself.

1211
00:44:59,038 --> 00:45:00,138
Thank you.

1212
00:45:01,538 --> 00:45:02,538
(Stamping)

1213
00:45:04,338 --> 00:45:06,478
- Dubai! - Dubai!

1214
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:07,938
(Ji Hyo got 1 and Gary got 2.)

1215
00:45:09,108 --> 00:45:11,508
Is this really not possible?

1216
00:45:11,778 --> 00:45:13,338
I have no clue.

1217
00:45:13,408 --> 00:45:14,938
(Are they thinking about ziplining?)

1218
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:16,108
I can jump.

1219
00:45:16,438 --> 00:45:17,878
Oh, my.

1220
00:45:17,938 --> 00:45:19,208
- Don't lie. - Really.

1221
00:45:19,238 --> 00:45:20,978
I'll make a call and do it.

1222
00:45:21,038 --> 00:45:22,238
- You know you can't. - Really.

1223
00:45:22,308 --> 00:45:23,938
- Look at him. - I'm serious.

1224
00:45:24,238 --> 00:45:26,238
I bet my whole fortune.

1225
00:45:26,438 --> 00:45:27,438
Really?

1226
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:29,838
Do you really...

1227
00:45:29,878 --> 00:45:32,038
want to get kicked out from your house by your wife?

1228
00:45:32,338 --> 00:45:33,538
She would really do that, you know.

1229
00:45:34,238 --> 00:45:35,338
I can't jump.

1230
00:45:35,408 --> 00:45:37,838
- We'll go and see. - Is it at a shopping centre?

1231
00:45:38,238 --> 00:45:39,938
We don't even have money with us.

1232
00:45:40,038 --> 00:45:41,308
Why? We have 27 dollars.

1233
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:42,938
What can we buy with 27 dollars?

1234
00:45:43,238 --> 00:45:44,738
What about with 54 dollars?

1235
00:45:45,538 --> 00:45:46,938
It's enough to buy something.

1236
00:45:47,038 --> 00:45:48,238
Yes, it is.

1237
00:45:48,538 --> 00:45:50,338
Seok Jin, you should buy that.

1238
00:45:50,438 --> 00:45:51,538
- It's cheap here. - What?

1239
00:45:51,538 --> 00:45:52,538
Buy oil.

1240
00:45:52,638 --> 00:45:54,438
(Buy oil.)

1241
00:45:54,538 --> 00:45:55,938
Buy 54 dollars worth of oil.

1242
00:45:56,038 --> 00:45:57,438
Bring oil back as a gift.

1243
00:45:57,938 --> 00:45:59,138
Buy some oil.

1244
00:45:59,208 --> 00:46:00,238
Do you think you're making sense?

1245
00:46:00,338 --> 00:46:01,408
It makes perfect sense.

1246
00:46:01,538 --> 00:46:03,108
- Why doesn't it make sense? - You should say something to him.

1247
00:46:03,138 --> 00:46:04,638
- Why? - So should I go to...

1248
00:46:04,738 --> 00:46:06,338
the supermarket and buy oil as a gift?

1249
00:46:06,438 --> 00:46:08,038
- Is that what you're saying? - Yes.

1250
00:46:08,138 --> 00:46:10,308
Are you talking about those gift sets with bottled oil?

1251
00:46:10,338 --> 00:46:12,738
- Should I buy Dubaian oil? - Yes, you should.

1252
00:46:13,338 --> 00:46:14,408
It's over there.

1253
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,538
(While they were quarrelling, they have arrived.)

1254
00:46:17,238 --> 00:46:18,238
Okay, thank you.

1255
00:46:18,338 --> 00:46:19,338
(The zipline is hung across the sky.)

1256
00:46:19,438 --> 00:46:20,638
We should get going. Wait a minute.

1257
00:46:20,738 --> 00:46:22,838
(He hesitates.)

1258
00:46:22,938 --> 00:46:24,208
It's doable.

1259
00:46:25,138 --> 00:46:26,338
(Are you sure this is doable?)

1260
00:46:26,438 --> 00:46:27,438
It's doable.

1261
00:46:28,538 --> 00:46:29,778
Which way do we need to go?

1262
00:46:30,038 --> 00:46:31,508
It's this way.

1263
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:32,738
You're right.

1264
00:46:35,308 --> 00:46:36,308
Which floor is it?

1265
00:46:36,338 --> 00:46:38,308
It's the 28th floor.

1266
00:46:39,138 --> 00:46:40,138
Hello.

1267
00:46:41,638 --> 00:46:43,978
Who's going to jump? Both of you?

1268
00:46:44,038 --> 00:46:45,138
- Yes. - Yes.

1269
00:46:46,338 --> 00:46:49,208
- Both of you guys? - Yes.

1270
00:46:49,238 --> 00:46:51,508
Signing the consent form makes me nervous.

1271
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:53,538
(Seok Jin is becoming nervous.)

1272
00:46:55,738 --> 00:46:56,838
Seok Jin.

1273
00:46:57,738 --> 00:46:59,038
If you're scared, just go back down.

1274
00:46:59,638 --> 00:47:00,638
What are you talking about?

1275
00:47:00,738 --> 00:47:03,138
You should go back down if you're scared.

1276
00:47:03,978 --> 00:47:05,208
My goodness.

1277
00:47:05,238 --> 00:47:11,738
(They finally reach the starting point of the zipline.)

1278
00:47:13,238 --> 00:47:14,338
Oh, my.

1279
00:47:14,838 --> 00:47:16,538
I don't think I can do it.

1280
00:47:17,638 --> 00:47:18,978
Wow, this is really something.

1281
00:47:19,438 --> 00:47:20,978
- I'll just go and see. - Okay.

1282
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:22,438
I'll just take a look.

1283
00:47:28,308 --> 00:47:29,438
Oh, my gosh!

1284
00:47:29,538 --> 00:47:32,108
(Astonished)

1285
00:47:34,338 --> 00:47:37,978
(This is the Dubai zipline.)

1286
00:47:39,108 --> 00:47:42,638
(They need to jump from 90m high...)

1287
00:47:42,738 --> 00:47:46,038
(and descend on a 600m long rope.)

1288
00:47:46,108 --> 00:47:47,778
Let's think about this.

1289
00:47:48,038 --> 00:47:50,408
- This is driving me crazy. - It's...

1290
00:47:50,938 --> 00:47:52,538
scarier than I had expected.

1291
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:54,538
This is no joke.

1292
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:56,538
Look at that.

1293
00:47:57,538 --> 00:47:59,438
This is no joke.

1294
00:48:00,338 --> 00:48:01,508
Oh, my.

1295
00:48:01,538 --> 00:48:03,338
(How am I supposed to do this?)

1296
00:48:06,838 --> 00:48:09,138
Gary, let's go buy some snacks.

1297
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:13,638
This place is very unique.

1298
00:48:13,738 --> 00:48:15,408
(They visit the traditional market, Souk Madinat Jumeirah.)

1299
00:48:15,938 --> 00:48:17,738
This place is very fancy.

1300
00:48:18,838 --> 00:48:20,738
Gary, there's ice cream.

1301
00:48:20,838 --> 00:48:21,978
There's ice cream.

1302
00:48:22,838 --> 00:48:24,778
- Should we get one? - Let's have some ice cream.

1303
00:48:24,838 --> 00:48:26,238
(They first spend money on ice cream.)

1304
00:48:26,308 --> 00:48:27,438
Excuse me,

1305
00:48:27,538 --> 00:48:29,838
I would like some ice cream on a cone.

1306
00:48:30,878 --> 00:48:32,038
I want one on a cone.

1307
00:48:32,578 --> 00:48:33,938
I want one in a cup.

1308
00:48:34,338 --> 00:48:35,638
The ice cream is on me...

1309
00:48:35,708 --> 00:48:37,138
- since you did so much. - No, I'll pay.

1310
00:48:37,408 --> 00:48:38,638
No, I'll buy it.

1311
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:40,978
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1312
00:48:42,538 --> 00:48:43,778
This tastes good!

1313
00:48:44,238 --> 00:48:45,738
Maybe it's tasty because we were at the beach.

1314
00:48:47,238 --> 00:48:49,108
Gary, what is that?

1315
00:48:50,138 --> 00:48:52,238
They're cutting it up as if it were yeot.

1316
00:48:52,538 --> 00:48:53,638
"Yeot"?

1317
00:48:53,738 --> 00:48:55,978
(It sounds like something else.)

1318
00:48:56,038 --> 00:48:57,338
Gary, look at that.

1319
00:48:58,038 --> 00:49:01,508
(Is this Middle Eastern yeot?)

1320
00:49:03,538 --> 00:49:04,608
(What is this?)

1321
00:49:04,678 --> 00:49:05,838
Good morning.

1322
00:49:05,938 --> 00:49:08,338
What... What... What is this?

1323
00:49:08,778 --> 00:49:10,438
It's Turkish delight.

1324
00:49:10,638 --> 00:49:12,938
Is it something like candy?

1325
00:49:13,038 --> 00:49:16,808
(Turkish Delight is Middle Eastern taffy made with nuts and sugar.)

1326
00:49:19,938 --> 00:49:20,978
It's like jelly.

1327
00:49:21,038 --> 00:49:22,138
(It's like jelly.)

1328
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:24,408
Can my girlfriend have a taste?

1329
00:49:24,408 --> 00:49:26,408
(Can my girlfriend have a taste?)

1330
00:49:26,708 --> 00:49:27,778
(Here you go.)

1331
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:28,878
Thank you.

1332
00:49:29,608 --> 00:49:31,978
I said you're my girlfriend so that he'd let you taste it.

1333
00:49:32,038 --> 00:49:33,108
All right.

1334
00:49:33,408 --> 00:49:34,408
(Chomping)

1335
00:49:34,508 --> 00:49:35,508
It tastes good, right?

1336
00:49:35,778 --> 00:49:38,938
- Wait. - It's like jelly with nuts in it.

1337
00:49:39,408 --> 00:49:41,708
I think I tried this before.

1338
00:49:43,138 --> 00:49:44,138
- Can I get a half sized one? - All right.

1339
00:49:44,208 --> 00:49:46,408
(Gary decides to buy some.)

1340
00:49:46,508 --> 00:49:47,608
Is it 23 dollars?

1341
00:49:47,678 --> 00:49:49,108
(It costs around 23 dollars.)

1342
00:49:49,138 --> 00:49:50,208
It's too expensive.

1343
00:49:51,508 --> 00:49:53,778
- Okay. - Do we have enough money?

1344
00:49:54,508 --> 00:49:55,708
(Gary spent 23 dollars from their pocket money for the taffy.)

1345
00:49:55,738 --> 00:49:56,738
Thank you.

1346
00:49:57,838 --> 00:49:59,608
- Have a good day. - Thank you.

1347
00:50:00,208 --> 00:50:02,408
- Gary, let me manage our money. - Yes?

1348
00:50:02,778 --> 00:50:05,208
- Let me manage it. - Am I spending too much?

1349
00:50:05,308 --> 00:50:08,708
You're too easily persuaded.

1350
00:50:08,938 --> 00:50:09,978
A fortune-teller said the similar thing.

1351
00:50:10,038 --> 00:50:11,938
(A fortune-teller said the similar thing.)

1352
00:50:11,978 --> 00:50:13,738
He said that I should let woman manage my money.

1353
00:50:13,778 --> 00:50:15,608
Give it to me.

1354
00:50:15,678 --> 00:50:16,808
(Gary needs someone to take care of him.)

1355
00:50:17,138 --> 00:50:19,608
Wait. What's that?

1356
00:50:19,678 --> 00:50:20,708
(What's that?)

1357
00:50:20,778 --> 00:50:21,938
- Hello. - Hi.

1358
00:50:22,038 --> 00:50:23,778
- Hi. - How are you?

1359
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:24,838
- Fine, thank you. - Good.

1360
00:50:25,208 --> 00:50:27,208
If you make a payment, I make this in five minutes.

1361
00:50:27,678 --> 00:50:29,738
It's made of sand. It's amazing.

1362
00:50:29,878 --> 00:50:30,938
Let me show you.

1363
00:50:30,978 --> 00:50:32,508
(Sand art made with different colours of sand)

1364
00:50:32,608 --> 00:50:33,678
It's amazing.

1365
00:50:33,708 --> 00:50:35,608
(Sand art made with different colours of sand)

1366
00:50:35,708 --> 00:50:37,208
Wow!

1367
00:50:37,308 --> 00:50:38,408
(They're impressed)

1368
00:50:38,508 --> 00:50:39,678
Good!

1369
00:50:40,108 --> 00:50:41,238
(But...)

1370
00:50:41,308 --> 00:50:43,208
(it's where they have to complete a mission.)

1371
00:50:43,308 --> 00:50:46,608
You get one stamp if you finish the puzzle before he finishes his work.

1372
00:50:46,678 --> 00:50:47,838
(You get one stamp if you finish the puzzle before he finishes his work.)

1373
00:50:47,938 --> 00:50:49,708
Now? Do we start now?

1374
00:50:49,878 --> 00:50:51,208
This is easy.

1375
00:50:52,408 --> 00:50:54,878
- Let's do it. Do we go one by one? - Yes.

1376
00:50:56,208 --> 00:50:58,108
(A match with a sand master)

1377
00:50:58,138 --> 00:50:59,208
Start.

1378
00:50:59,708 --> 00:51:00,978
Wait. Is this the puzzle?

1379
00:51:01,708 --> 00:51:02,778
Oh, this is how you do it.

1380
00:51:02,838 --> 00:51:03,938
(Oh, this is how you do it.)

1381
00:51:04,038 --> 00:51:06,408
- Ji Hyo, I can't do this. - Oh, it's the one.

1382
00:51:06,508 --> 00:51:07,508
I can't do this.

1383
00:51:07,608 --> 00:51:08,778
(I can't do this.)

1384
00:51:08,878 --> 00:51:09,938
(He wasn't expecting to use his brain.)

1385
00:51:09,978 --> 00:51:11,038
Ji Hyo, I can't do this.

1386
00:51:11,878 --> 00:51:14,038
- I'm doomed. - You can do it. Try.

1387
00:51:14,138 --> 00:51:15,138
You can do it.

1388
00:51:17,308 --> 00:51:19,708
Like this. This one goes here.

1389
00:51:21,308 --> 00:51:22,938
(You can do it, Gary!)

1390
00:51:24,208 --> 00:51:25,308
Well...

1391
00:51:26,808 --> 00:51:28,738
(I need to do something.)

1392
00:51:30,778 --> 00:51:32,138
Sir, I don't like that.

1393
00:51:32,208 --> 00:51:33,308
(She's trying to help Gary.)

1394
00:51:33,408 --> 00:51:35,578
I want this colour.

1395
00:51:35,608 --> 00:51:36,738
(I want this colour.)

1396
00:51:36,878 --> 00:51:39,038
(Ji Hyo is distracting him to buy Gary more time.)

1397
00:51:39,578 --> 00:51:41,738
- Hurry up. - Ji Hyo... I...

1398
00:51:41,878 --> 00:51:43,138
(I don't think I can do this.)

1399
00:51:43,208 --> 00:51:44,508
Ji Hyo, I can't do this.

1400
00:51:45,578 --> 00:51:46,608
I can't.

1401
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:48,838
Hurry up.

1402
00:51:48,938 --> 00:51:50,408
(While Gary is struggling, the sand art is almost done.)

1403
00:51:50,508 --> 00:51:51,508
Ji Hyo.

1404
00:51:52,408 --> 00:51:55,208
Do it slowly, please.

1405
00:51:55,308 --> 00:51:57,138
(Please take your time.)

1406
00:51:58,508 --> 00:51:59,508
(Pushing)

1407
00:52:00,978 --> 00:52:02,978
(What?)

1408
00:52:03,038 --> 00:52:04,108
Oh, it's done.

1409
00:52:04,738 --> 00:52:06,408
(Stunned)

1410
00:52:06,508 --> 00:52:07,508
Is it done?

1411
00:52:07,978 --> 00:52:09,038
(Gary succeeds.)

1412
00:52:09,108 --> 00:52:10,708
Ji Hyo, I did it.

1413
00:52:10,738 --> 00:52:12,678
I finished it without realising it.

1414
00:52:13,738 --> 00:52:16,208
Ji Hyo, I did it! Yes!

1415
00:52:16,878 --> 00:52:20,108
(With Ji Hyo's help, Gary cleared the mission.)

1416
00:52:20,138 --> 00:52:22,108
- It looks so nice. - Thank you, Ji Hyo.

1417
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:24,938
(This is why every man needs a wise woman.)

1418
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:26,208
Thank you so much.

1419
00:52:27,508 --> 00:52:29,308
(Proud)

1420
00:52:29,408 --> 00:52:30,878
I might have to sleep...

1421
00:52:31,608 --> 00:52:33,708
outside in the desert like this tonight.

1422
00:52:33,778 --> 00:52:34,778
(He might have to sleep outside in the desert like this tonight.)

1423
00:52:36,308 --> 00:52:38,608
I might be sleeping in this desert tonight.

1424
00:52:39,878 --> 00:52:40,938
It's going to be like camping.

1425
00:52:43,308 --> 00:52:44,308
Oh my goodness.

1426
00:52:44,408 --> 00:52:47,208
(They have 3 hours until the end.)

1427
00:52:47,408 --> 00:52:48,838
- So... - What will you do?

1428
00:52:48,938 --> 00:52:50,738
- What will you do? - Go down if you're scared.

1429
00:52:51,578 --> 00:52:53,208
What are you talking about?

1430
00:52:54,408 --> 00:52:56,108
(Sighing)

1431
00:52:56,208 --> 00:52:57,308
How fast is it?

1432
00:52:57,708 --> 00:52:59,308
It's 70km per hour.

1433
00:52:59,408 --> 00:53:01,038
Did you hear that?

1434
00:53:01,108 --> 00:53:02,138
It takes about 40 seconds to arrive there.

1435
00:53:02,738 --> 00:53:04,408
- Did you say 40 seconds? - Yes, 40 seconds.

1436
00:53:04,508 --> 00:53:06,408
- Gosh, 40 seconds. - Is it 70 or 17?

1437
00:53:06,408 --> 00:53:08,978
- It's 70km per hour. - I see.

1438
00:53:09,038 --> 00:53:11,508
- He says it's 70km per hour. - It's 600m long.

1439
00:53:11,578 --> 00:53:12,608
(The course is 600m long.)

1440
00:53:12,678 --> 00:53:14,308
We just need to hold out for 40 seconds.

1441
00:53:17,208 --> 00:53:18,208
Was there any accident?

1442
00:53:19,208 --> 00:53:20,208
Any accident?

1443
00:53:20,708 --> 00:53:21,738
Not today.

1444
00:53:22,038 --> 00:53:23,108
What?

1445
00:53:23,208 --> 00:53:25,308
(Does it mean that there were accidents in the past?)

1446
00:53:25,508 --> 00:53:26,808
(I can't even laugh at a joke.)

1447
00:53:26,838 --> 00:53:28,878
- Was that a joke? - Yes.

1448
00:53:31,038 --> 00:53:33,038
- Are you going to do it? - I am.

1449
00:53:33,138 --> 00:53:34,138
Let's sign the consent form first.

1450
00:53:34,838 --> 00:53:36,938
- Let's do it. - Let's sign first.

1451
00:53:37,038 --> 00:53:38,208
Do you think I can't do this?

1452
00:53:38,308 --> 00:53:39,508
- Fine, I'll sign the paper. - Do it.

1453
00:53:39,578 --> 00:53:40,938
You don't know me.

1454
00:53:41,138 --> 00:53:43,708
I can even skydive.

1455
00:53:43,738 --> 00:53:46,108
Who are you trying to fool?

1456
00:53:46,138 --> 00:53:48,408
- Do I sign here? - Do it.

1457
00:53:49,108 --> 00:53:50,108
Sit down.

1458
00:53:50,208 --> 00:53:53,578
(It's like they're having an autograph event there.)

1459
00:53:53,608 --> 00:53:54,678
- Gosh. - Here.

1460
00:53:55,508 --> 00:53:56,978
- Oh my goodness. - Wait.

1461
00:53:58,038 --> 00:53:59,678
Do you have another pen with a different colour?

1462
00:54:00,208 --> 00:54:01,608
- Is it red? - It's red coloured.

1463
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:03,738
(He's scared of writing his name in red.)

1464
00:54:03,778 --> 00:54:05,838
- You must be scared. - It's unlucky to write it in red.

1465
00:54:05,938 --> 00:54:08,678
I don't want to be unlucky by writing my name in red.

1466
00:54:09,508 --> 00:54:10,708
No, never.

1467
00:54:11,208 --> 00:54:12,508
Thank you.

1468
00:54:12,578 --> 00:54:13,608
(Signing with a black pen)

1469
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:15,978
You seem determined.

1470
00:54:17,308 --> 00:54:18,308
Okay.

1471
00:54:20,138 --> 00:54:22,938
(Seok Jin signs on the consent form, too.)

1472
00:54:24,778 --> 00:54:25,838
All right.

1473
00:54:26,878 --> 00:54:27,938
(He's certainly not determined.)

1474
00:54:28,038 --> 00:54:29,038
Okay.

1475
00:54:29,738 --> 00:54:31,838
- Put your left foot in here. - Okay.

1476
00:54:31,938 --> 00:54:34,408
(They put on the equipment as soon as they signed the paper.)

1477
00:54:34,508 --> 00:54:35,878
Oh my goodness.

1478
00:54:35,938 --> 00:54:38,978
(They're thrilled to death.)

1479
00:54:39,738 --> 00:54:41,138
We're in trouble.

1480
00:54:41,408 --> 00:54:42,408
- Wait. - Wait!

1481
00:54:42,778 --> 00:54:43,878
I'm not going to do this.

1482
00:54:43,938 --> 00:54:44,978
(He's not going to do this.)

1483
00:54:45,038 --> 00:54:47,138
(It's too late to give up.)

1484
00:54:47,208 --> 00:54:48,208
What should I do?

1485
00:54:49,878 --> 00:54:51,708
(Nervous)

1486
00:54:51,878 --> 00:54:53,108
What should I do?

1487
00:54:53,138 --> 00:54:55,508
- This will be tightened up there. - Okay.

1488
00:54:55,608 --> 00:54:57,878
Will it be safe?

1489
00:54:57,938 --> 00:54:58,938
(Will it be safe?)

1490
00:54:59,038 --> 00:55:00,138
Okay.

1491
00:55:01,138 --> 00:55:02,308
Seok Jin, I'm going for it now.

1492
00:55:02,408 --> 00:55:03,408
(Seok Jin, I'm going for it now.)

1493
00:55:04,038 --> 00:55:05,978
Jae Seok is really doing it.

1494
00:55:09,778 --> 00:55:12,608
Gosh! I can't do this.

1495
00:55:13,878 --> 00:55:15,208
(Wow)

1496
00:55:15,308 --> 00:55:16,308
Is it not dangerous?

1497
00:55:19,208 --> 00:55:21,138
(Jae Seok is going first for the X-line zipline.)

1498
00:55:21,238 --> 00:55:22,308
Are you sure about it?

1499
00:55:22,778 --> 00:55:24,308
- Seriously? - Wait, do I have to film it?

1500
00:55:24,338 --> 00:55:26,138
- You should film yourself. - How can I?

1501
00:55:26,208 --> 00:55:27,938
(The cameraman gives him the camera.)

1502
00:55:28,038 --> 00:55:29,038
My heart is pounding.

1503
00:55:29,608 --> 00:55:30,608
Jae Seok.

1504
00:55:31,608 --> 00:55:32,608
I'm going crazy.

1505
00:55:32,938 --> 00:55:33,938
(You should hold the camera like this.)

1506
00:55:34,038 --> 00:55:35,208
- It's too high. - What do I film?

1507
00:55:35,738 --> 00:55:38,508
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin are going out of control.)

1508
00:55:38,608 --> 00:55:39,678
What about me?

1509
00:55:40,778 --> 00:55:41,838
It's too high.

1510
00:55:43,308 --> 00:55:45,878
(What am I doing here?)

1511
00:55:47,938 --> 00:55:48,978
Jae Seok.

1512
00:55:49,038 --> 00:55:50,138
(Welcome to the X-line zipline.)

1513
00:55:50,208 --> 00:55:52,578
This is not for everybody, you know?

1514
00:55:52,708 --> 00:55:54,938
(Taking off his glasses)

1515
00:55:54,978 --> 00:55:56,208
He is really going to do it.

1516
00:55:58,778 --> 00:56:01,608
(Let's do it.)

1517
00:56:01,708 --> 00:56:03,408
I even have to hold a camera myself.

1518
00:56:04,038 --> 00:56:05,108
Seok Jin.

1519
00:56:05,408 --> 00:56:06,408
I'm scared to death.

1520
00:56:06,508 --> 00:56:07,938
(He's scared to death.)

1521
00:56:08,038 --> 00:56:10,208
Jae Seok, let's not do this.

1522
00:56:12,038 --> 00:56:13,108
Come closer.

1523
00:56:13,138 --> 00:56:15,108
(Jae Seok is finally ready.)

1524
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:17,878
Once it's hooked, there's no turning back.

1525
00:56:18,038 --> 00:56:19,208
(Hooked)

1526
00:56:19,308 --> 00:56:21,038
All right. Slowly sit down now.

1527
00:56:21,138 --> 00:56:23,408
- Okay. - He's out of his mind.

1528
00:56:25,778 --> 00:56:26,978
Is he really going to be all right?

1529
00:56:27,038 --> 00:56:28,108
(Jae Seok looks different today.)

1530
00:56:28,878 --> 00:56:31,408
- Lean back. - Okay.

1531
00:56:32,578 --> 00:56:34,708
- That camera is... - Seok Jin.

1532
00:56:34,778 --> 00:56:36,678
Are you going to do this?

1533
00:56:36,708 --> 00:56:37,778
(Do I look nervous?)

1534
00:56:38,138 --> 00:56:39,208
You're about to take off.

1535
00:56:40,878 --> 00:56:42,738
What should I do? My son must watch it.

1536
00:56:42,778 --> 00:56:45,038
(His heart is pounding crazy.)

1537
00:56:46,038 --> 00:56:48,738
(The producer goes closer to him.)

1538
00:56:50,778 --> 00:56:53,138
- What? - You have to memorise...

1539
00:56:53,208 --> 00:56:54,308
the following words after arrival.

1540
00:56:54,408 --> 00:56:56,608
- How will I remember them? - Memorise what?

1541
00:56:57,878 --> 00:56:59,978
Do we have a mission on top of that?

1542
00:57:00,308 --> 00:57:01,308
What is this?

1543
00:57:01,438 --> 00:57:04,508
(While in his most nervous moment, he receives a mission.)

1544
00:57:04,578 --> 00:57:09,138
(Given words are Spice Souk, Gold Souk and Textile Souk.)

1545
00:57:09,208 --> 00:57:11,938
Spice Souk, Gold Souk and Textile Souk.

1546
00:57:11,978 --> 00:57:13,608
Look at his shaking legs.

1547
00:57:14,308 --> 00:57:15,308
Look at his legs.

1548
00:57:15,408 --> 00:57:16,678
(Shaking)

1549
00:57:18,208 --> 00:57:19,308
He's shaking.

1550
00:57:19,408 --> 00:57:20,578
(Deep breathing)

1551
00:57:20,778 --> 00:57:22,878
- This must be a dream. - All right.

1552
00:57:22,938 --> 00:57:24,708
Okay.

1553
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,678
It's so terrifying.

1554
00:57:27,708 --> 00:57:28,708
(He's about to start.)

1555
00:57:29,308 --> 00:57:30,308
Oh, my.

1556
00:57:30,408 --> 00:57:31,608
My goodness.

1557
00:57:31,708 --> 00:57:33,108
(My goodness)

1558
00:57:33,208 --> 00:57:34,778
Okay.

1559
00:57:34,878 --> 00:57:36,308
- Do you want to go? - Yes.

1560
00:57:36,408 --> 00:57:37,778
- Are you ready? - I'm ready.

1561
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:39,338
Going in five seconds.

1562
00:57:39,438 --> 00:57:41,608
(Going in five seconds)

1563
00:57:41,738 --> 00:57:46,708
(You'd better be prepared for the height and wide distance.)

1564
00:57:48,778 --> 00:57:50,838
(Nervous)

1565
00:57:50,938 --> 00:57:52,208
Going in five seconds.

1566
00:57:52,308 --> 00:57:53,308
In five,

1567
00:57:55,938 --> 00:57:56,978
four,

1568
00:57:58,938 --> 00:57:59,938
three,

1569
00:58:02,138 --> 00:58:03,208
- two... - Gosh!

1570
00:58:05,108 --> 00:58:08,508
In 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1.

1571
00:58:09,038 --> 00:58:10,408
(Go!)

1572
00:58:10,508 --> 00:58:11,778
Help me! Mum!

1573
00:58:13,938 --> 00:58:16,308
- In 2 and 1, go! - Gosh!

1574
00:58:16,608 --> 00:58:18,208
Help me! Mum!

1575
00:58:18,508 --> 00:58:21,238
- In 2 and 1, go! - Gosh!

1576
00:58:21,408 --> 00:58:22,938
Help me! Mum!

1577
00:58:24,938 --> 00:58:25,938
I'm sorry.

1578
00:58:26,578 --> 00:58:27,678
I'm sorry.

1579
00:58:29,778 --> 00:58:33,508
(Jae Seok is flying in the sky!)

1580
00:58:33,608 --> 00:58:36,608
I'm sorry.

1581
00:58:37,308 --> 00:58:40,208
I won't do it again. I'm sorry.

1582
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:43,878
(Is he seeing his life flash before his eyes?)

1583
00:58:43,938 --> 00:58:48,578
(He's looking back on his life.)

1584
00:58:49,308 --> 00:58:52,208
I'm sorry.

1585
00:58:52,838 --> 00:58:54,578
I won't do it again.

1586
00:58:54,978 --> 00:58:56,978
(Screaming)

1587
00:58:58,608 --> 00:59:01,238
(Let me go back.)

1588
00:59:02,578 --> 00:59:04,678
(He suddenly looks so different.)

1589
00:59:05,878 --> 00:59:06,878
I'm thirsty.

1590
00:59:08,708 --> 00:59:12,208
(Welcome back, Jae Seok!)

1591
00:59:12,338 --> 00:59:15,838
(He successfully finished riding the 40-second X-line zipline.)

1592
00:59:19,608 --> 00:59:20,738
(He was terrified.)

1593
00:59:22,638 --> 00:59:24,738
(He wants to go down.)

1594
00:59:24,838 --> 00:59:26,038
(He wants to go home.)

1595
00:59:27,238 --> 00:59:30,038
(He's ragged.)

1596
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:32,538
(Oh my gosh)

1597
00:59:36,038 --> 00:59:37,508
It was terrifying.

1598
00:59:37,638 --> 00:59:42,108
(He won on the fight against himself.)

1599
00:59:42,138 --> 00:59:43,938
(However, the joy didn't last long.)

1600
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:46,508
Please give us the answer to the question you received.

1601
00:59:47,738 --> 00:59:51,208
It's Spice Souk, Gold Souk and Textile Souk.

1602
00:59:51,578 --> 00:59:52,608
Correct.

1603
00:59:52,638 --> 00:59:55,338
(He succeeds the mission.)

1604
00:59:56,438 --> 00:59:59,338
(He might be able to avoid sleeping in the desert.)

1605
00:59:59,938 --> 01:00:02,738
(Now, it's time for Seok Jin to ride the zipline.)

1606
01:00:02,738 --> 01:00:05,238
(He's terrified.)

1607
01:00:06,938 --> 01:00:07,938
Gosh.

1608
01:00:08,608 --> 01:00:09,638
I'm going mad here.

1609
01:00:10,738 --> 01:00:12,038
I can't trust the rope.

1610
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:14,038
(I can trust our staff but not that imported rope.)

1611
01:00:14,138 --> 01:00:16,238
Gosh, why did I have to be born like this?

1612
01:00:18,408 --> 01:00:19,478
Oh my gosh.

1613
01:00:20,708 --> 01:00:21,938
I am too terrified.

1614
01:00:22,038 --> 01:00:23,238
I'm serious.

1615
01:00:23,308 --> 01:00:24,838
(Seok Jin gives up.)

1616
01:00:25,638 --> 01:00:26,938
(Kwang Soo joins the zipline mission.)

1617
01:00:26,978 --> 01:00:28,938
Oh, gosh. Wait.

1618
01:00:29,038 --> 01:00:30,338
(He came after finishing the mission at JBR Beach.)

1619
01:00:32,438 --> 01:00:34,408
(He's stiff.)

1620
01:00:36,138 --> 01:00:37,138
All right.

1621
01:00:37,438 --> 01:00:40,038
- Oh, okay. - Sit down.

1622
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:44,438
Oh, gosh.

1623
01:00:44,508 --> 01:00:45,838
(His voice goes up.)

1624
01:00:45,938 --> 01:00:47,038
He's about to ride it.

1625
01:00:47,038 --> 01:00:49,038
(He's scared.)

1626
01:00:49,108 --> 01:00:50,108
Come on.

1627
01:00:50,478 --> 01:00:52,638
- There goes Kwang Soo. - Hold on.

1628
01:00:53,478 --> 01:00:55,138
I'm going to fall.

1629
01:00:55,938 --> 01:00:57,038
Gosh.

1630
01:00:57,838 --> 01:00:59,238
(The producer gives him the mission.)

1631
01:00:59,838 --> 01:01:03,478
(Why does it have to be at this moment?)

1632
01:01:03,538 --> 01:01:06,038
Jumeirah Beach. Jumeirah Mosque.

1633
01:01:06,108 --> 01:01:07,738
- Palm Jumeirah. - Shut up!

1634
01:01:08,638 --> 01:01:09,738
Get lost!

1635
01:01:09,838 --> 01:01:10,938
(Kwang Soo is upset.)

1636
01:01:11,308 --> 01:01:12,838
- Are you ready? - Go!

1637
01:01:13,138 --> 01:01:14,338
(He's taking off in five seconds.)

1638
01:01:14,408 --> 01:01:16,638
- You will leave in five seconds. - Gosh.

1639
01:01:16,838 --> 01:01:18,538
- Seriously! - He's gone pale.

1640
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:20,108
- No! - Go!

1641
01:01:21,738 --> 01:01:23,108
- No! - Go!

1642
01:01:28,408 --> 01:01:30,108
(He's like an unidentified flying object.)

1643
01:01:31,208 --> 01:01:34,208
(He's thrilled!)

1644
01:01:36,138 --> 01:01:37,838
His hat dropped.

1645
01:01:38,138 --> 01:01:39,208
His hat dropped.

1646
01:01:39,408 --> 01:01:41,578
(He's more shocked that he lost his hat.)

1647
01:01:41,638 --> 01:01:43,538
(He breaks into tears.)

1648
01:01:45,338 --> 01:01:48,208
(He doesn't want to let his hat go.)

1649
01:01:48,508 --> 01:01:49,638
Someone is coming.

1650
01:01:50,578 --> 01:01:51,638
Isn't it Kwang Soo?

1651
01:01:52,438 --> 01:01:54,738
(It's Kwang Soo.)

1652
01:01:56,338 --> 01:02:00,938
(He returned from the terrifying zipline ride.)

1653
01:02:00,978 --> 01:02:02,038
Kwang Soo.

1654
01:02:02,108 --> 01:02:03,338
(He's gone.)

1655
01:02:03,408 --> 01:02:05,738
You look 10 years older now.

1656
01:02:06,838 --> 01:02:11,338
(Why does he look more aged?)

1657
01:02:11,408 --> 01:02:13,138
- I lost my hat. - Your hat?

1658
01:02:14,838 --> 01:02:17,538
Kwang Soo, please tell us the answer.

1659
01:02:17,638 --> 01:02:18,738
(He has to memorise the given words.)

1660
01:02:19,608 --> 01:02:20,708
Jumeirah...

1661
01:02:20,738 --> 01:02:22,838
(It's Jumeirah Beach, Jumeirah Mosque,)

1662
01:02:22,838 --> 01:02:24,138
(Palm Jumeirah and Madinat Jumeirah Souk.)

1663
01:02:24,208 --> 01:02:26,538
- You get five seconds. - Was it Jumeirah Saurus?

1664
01:02:26,608 --> 01:02:30,038
(He gives a wrong answer.)

1665
01:02:30,138 --> 01:02:31,138
Bing pong?

1666
01:02:31,538 --> 01:02:32,738
How come your face is so pale?

1667
01:02:33,408 --> 01:02:34,438
Incorrect.

1668
01:02:34,578 --> 01:02:35,638
(He fails the mission.)

1669
01:02:35,738 --> 01:02:37,038
- Well... - You failed the mission.

1670
01:02:37,638 --> 01:02:39,838
No way!

1671
01:02:40,478 --> 01:02:41,538
There must be a mission.

1672
01:02:41,608 --> 01:02:43,438
Maybe we have to guess how many bridges we passed.

1673
01:02:43,538 --> 01:02:44,938
(They continues clearing the missions as they travelled.)

1674
01:02:45,038 --> 01:02:46,808
Good job, Ji Hyo!

1675
01:02:46,978 --> 01:02:48,638
This is too difficult.

1676
01:02:48,938 --> 01:02:50,738
- Hurry up! - You are close to getting it!

1677
01:02:51,538 --> 01:02:53,508
- Okay! - Good job!

1678
01:02:53,578 --> 01:02:55,838
(They only have 30 minutes left.)

1679
01:02:56,838 --> 01:02:58,838
(Ji Hyo and Gary are on the lead so far.)

1680
01:03:04,438 --> 01:03:07,838
(Finally, they are ready to take off for the sky diving.)

1681
01:03:07,838 --> 01:03:09,638
See you!

1682
01:03:09,738 --> 01:03:10,738
We'll get going!

1683
01:03:10,978 --> 01:03:13,138
- We will come back alive. - We will be back alive.

1684
01:03:13,208 --> 01:03:14,238
(We will be back alive.)

1685
01:03:16,138 --> 01:03:18,508
(They have 30 minutes left until the end of their given time.)

1686
01:03:18,638 --> 01:03:19,638
You jump first.

1687
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:21,408
No, I will jump last.

1688
01:03:22,638 --> 01:03:24,138
Please jump first.

1689
01:03:24,208 --> 01:03:26,208
You want me to jump first? It's really okay with me.

1690
01:03:26,838 --> 01:03:27,938
- It's better to go first. - Let's go.

1691
01:03:27,978 --> 01:03:29,738
You'll get more scared watching others go.

1692
01:03:31,608 --> 01:03:35,038
(They start boarding on the one-way plane to the sky.)

1693
01:03:38,938 --> 01:03:40,578
(She's terrified.)

1694
01:03:42,638 --> 01:03:45,138
(He is totally ready to dominate the sky.)

1695
01:03:46,038 --> 01:03:48,208
(Jong Kook's excited.)

1696
01:03:51,478 --> 01:03:55,108
(They ride on a plane for the sky diving.)

1697
01:03:58,238 --> 01:04:01,938
(How far have you been to experience Dubai?)

1698
01:04:09,478 --> 01:04:11,638
(The aeroplane takes off.)

1699
01:04:14,538 --> 01:04:18,438
(They go up with trained instructors.)

1700
01:04:30,208 --> 01:04:33,138
(They are very excited.)

1701
01:04:41,608 --> 01:04:43,408
(She's nervous.)

1702
01:04:43,478 --> 01:04:44,578
I'm so nervous.

1703
01:04:45,038 --> 01:04:46,038
Goodness!

1704
01:04:46,208 --> 01:04:47,838
- I now feel it's real. - You do?

1705
01:04:49,108 --> 01:04:50,108
Oh my gosh.

1706
01:04:51,938 --> 01:04:53,838
- Are you okay? - Yes, I'm okay.

1707

- You can do it. - Thank you.

1709
01:05:01,138 --> 01:05:03,038
Anything else you want to say to the camera?

1710
01:05:03,508 --> 01:05:05,838
Please, save me.

1711
01:05:09,408 --> 01:05:10,978
Everyone,

1712
01:05:11,238 --> 01:05:12,338
I am...

1713

(She's extremely nervous.)

1714

I am going to skydive in four minutes.

1715
01:05:16,808 --> 01:05:17,838
Cheers!

1716

(She screams.)

1718
01:05:20,308 --> 01:05:22,238
All right, guys. Let's skydive! Let's go!

1719
01:05:22,308 --> 01:05:24,108
(It's time to skydive!)

1720
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:28,978
(He's going to check if they've arrived at the right place.)

1721
01:05:31,338 --> 01:05:33,038
(Green light)

1722
01:05:33,208 --> 01:05:35,978

(His instructor looks very relaxed.)

1730
01:06:02,338 --> 01:06:04,608
(Why did I volunteer to do this?)

1731
01:06:08,108 --> 01:06:11,508
(We get to see the nice view thanks to them.)

1732

Tell me anything about it.

1786
01:12:09,708 --> 01:12:11,508
I am so happy.

1787
01:12:11,608 --> 01:12:12,848
- Are you happy? - Yes.

1788
01:12:14,938 --> 01:12:16,408
That's Il Woo.

1789
01:12:16,408 --> 01:12:18,608
(The second skydiver Il Woo is about to land.)

1790
01:12:18,638 --> 01:12:20,038
Welcome back to the ground!

1791
01:12:22,978 --> 01:12:25,608
(He's back from the sky.)

1792
01:12:25,678 --> 01:12:26,708
Good job!

1793
01:12:27,208 --> 01:12:28,238
Did you have fun?

1794
01:12:28,738 --> 01:12:30,038
Now, you can take your goggles out.

1795
01:12:31,308 --> 01:12:33,708
(He's still excited.)

1796
01:12:33,778 --> 01:12:35,508
Where is the best place to have a skydiving?

1797
01:12:36,408 --> 01:12:38,778
- Good job. - Did you have fun?

1798
01:12:39,208 --> 01:12:40,708
Now, you can take your goggles out.

1799
01:12:41,978 --> 01:12:45,038
(Da Hey nailed it. She's coming down, too.)

1800
01:12:45,208 --> 01:12:50,608
(It's the view taken from Da Hey's camera.)

1801
01:12:50,938 --> 01:12:52,308
Oh my goodness.

1802
01:12:52,348 --> 01:12:57,208
(An angel is descending from the sky.)

1803
01:12:57,238 --> 01:12:59,348
(She's screaming.)

1804
01:12:59,508 --> 01:13:01,878
(Perfect landing)

1805
01:13:04,608 --> 01:13:05,638
Give me a high five.

1806
01:13:05,708 --> 01:13:06,708
(They're celebrating their success, too.)

1807
01:13:06,808 --> 01:13:09,308
You were scared but you stay alive.

1808
01:13:09,348 --> 01:13:10,538
- Here you are at the ground. - Yes, I'm alive.

1809
01:13:10,608 --> 01:13:12,108
Yes, I'm alive. I'm still alive.

1810
01:13:12,878 --> 01:13:14,878
- Beautiful! It was great. - How was the view?

1811
01:13:15,508 --> 01:13:17,978
It was amazing. I loved it.

1812
01:13:18,508 --> 01:13:19,778
I must give it a shot again.

1813
01:13:19,878 --> 01:13:20,878
(I must give it a shot again.)

1814
01:13:22,348 --> 01:13:23,778
The world I've seen above was...

1815
01:13:24,348 --> 01:13:26,508
like a utopia. It was wonderful.

1816
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:30,478
Mission complete!

1817
01:13:30,508 --> 01:13:32,408
(Mission complete!)

1818
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:33,878
Mission completed!

1819
01:13:34,978 --> 01:13:39,408
(All of the three cleared their mission.)

1820
01:13:41,138 --> 01:13:43,778
This feeling is indescribable.

1821
01:13:43,878 --> 01:13:45,348
It was so crazy.

1822
01:13:45,408 --> 01:13:46,408
(He won't forget about this feeling.)

1823
01:13:46,508 --> 01:13:48,508
Wow, this is amazing.

1824
01:13:48,778 --> 01:13:50,778
- This is incredible. - Really.

1825
01:13:50,878 --> 01:13:53,508
- We must do it in Dubai. - This is crazy.

1826
01:13:53,578 --> 01:13:56,238
You must try this at least once...

1827
01:13:56,348 --> 01:13:57,938
- in your life. - In your life.

1828
01:13:58,608 --> 01:14:00,978
- I am alive. - It was amazing.

1829
01:14:02,978 --> 01:14:04,138
This is...

1830
01:14:04,238 --> 01:14:06,408
(These brave three cleared the hardest mission perfectly.)

1831
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:08,778
It can't be compared to bungee jumping.

1832
01:14:09,208 --> 01:14:11,408
- I feel like... - I should've tried it earlier.

1833
01:14:11,508 --> 01:14:12,878
- It's a must in your life. - Right, this is a must in life.

1834
01:14:12,938 --> 01:14:14,608
- It wasn't that scary. - Everyone should try this.

1835
01:14:15,238 --> 01:14:16,878
- These are for you. - Right.

1836
01:14:16,938 --> 01:14:19,238
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1837
01:14:22,508 --> 01:14:24,138
(They get to sleep at an exclusive hotel in Dubai.)

1838
01:14:24,238 --> 01:14:25,348
Thank you.

1839
01:14:25,608 --> 01:14:27,608
I feel like I won an award.

1840
01:14:28,508 --> 01:14:29,608
Thank you.

1841
01:14:31,408 --> 01:14:33,878
(The individual travelling is over.)

1842
01:14:33,978 --> 01:14:35,608
We all nailed it.

1843
01:14:35,708 --> 01:14:37,408
- Da Hey, you're very brave. - Right.

1844
01:14:37,508 --> 01:14:39,508
(The game has just begun. What will be waiting for them?)

1845
01:14:43,738 --> 01:14:47,408
(How many stamps did they get?)

1846
01:14:48,608 --> 01:14:49,978
(All members gathered to go to the desert.)

1847
01:14:50,978 --> 01:14:52,038
I need some rest now.

1848
01:14:52,138 --> 01:14:53,208
(Let's head to the desert.)

1849
01:14:53,438 --> 01:14:55,538
(Will they get a chance to make a reverse?)

1850
01:14:55,608 --> 01:14:56,708
I wonder what we will do next.

1851
01:14:56,778 --> 01:14:58,938
(Will they get a chance to make a reverse?)

1852
01:15:01,608 --> 01:15:02,608
This is not my style, but...

1853
01:15:02,878 --> 01:15:06,408
(Jae Seok spruces himself up with the sunglasses to go to the desert.)

1854
01:15:09,308 --> 01:15:13,978
(After individual travelling, They are getting out of the downtown.)

1855
01:15:14,108 --> 01:15:16,408
(I might have to sleep outside if I can't turn over the result.)

1856
01:15:18,508 --> 01:15:22,408
(The automobiles are heading toward the desert in suburban area.)

1857
01:15:22,508 --> 01:15:26,608
(The automobiles are heading toward the desert in suburban area.)

1858
01:15:28,708 --> 01:15:31,938
(The members become drowsy on their way to the desert.)

1859
01:15:32,038 --> 01:15:35,348
(The members become drowsy on their way to the desert.)

1860
01:15:36,208 --> 01:15:38,978
(Kwang Soo is yawning very long.)

1861
01:15:39,108 --> 01:15:41,978
(Kwang Soo is yawning very long.)

1862
01:15:44,508 --> 01:15:48,138
(Now there's nothing but desert.)

1863
01:15:48,408 --> 01:15:52,978
(Desert is vast, and the members are falling in sleep.)

1864
01:15:54,878 --> 01:15:57,608
(You'd better take a nap when you can.)

1865
01:15:57,708 --> 01:16:00,508
(You'd better take a nap when you can.)

1866
01:16:01,408 --> 01:16:03,848
(They arrived at the intermediate station in the desert's entrance.)

1867
01:16:05,238 --> 01:16:08,138
(Half asleep and half awake)

1868
01:16:08,308 --> 01:16:11,238
(Why does he stop the car here?)

1869
01:16:11,348 --> 01:16:14,408
(Why does he stop the car here?)

1870
01:16:21,508 --> 01:16:25,348
(What are they doing?)

1871
01:16:25,408 --> 01:16:28,238
(The drivers are deflating the tires all of a sudden.)

1872
01:16:28,308 --> 01:16:31,238
(The drivers are deflating the tires all of a sudden.)

1873
01:16:31,308 --> 01:16:34,238
(Why are they deflating the tires?)

1874
01:16:34,878 --> 01:16:38,408
(You'll see why soon.)

1875
01:16:40,238 --> 01:16:42,408
Fasten your seat belt.

1876
01:16:43,408 --> 01:16:45,508
(We're moving into the middle of the desert now.)

1877
01:16:45,978 --> 01:16:48,778
- Is everybody ready? - Yes, I'm ready.

1878
01:16:48,848 --> 01:16:50,138
(They're ready.)

1879
01:16:50,608 --> 01:16:51,708
Let's go.

1880
01:16:51,848 --> 01:16:53,108
(Da Hey is pretty excited.)

1881
01:16:56,238 --> 01:17:00,878
(The main game has just begun. Let's go to the desert!)

1882
01:17:00,938 --> 01:17:03,108
- Is air conditioning okay? - Yes.

1883
01:17:03,138 --> 01:17:04,778
(Sure)

1884
01:17:06,508 --> 01:17:08,238
- Are you ready? - Yes.

1885
01:17:08,308 --> 01:17:09,708
Let's go!

1886
01:17:10,308 --> 01:17:11,938
(He's grinning.)

1887
01:17:12,938 --> 01:17:16,508
(What will be waiting for us in the desert?)

1888
01:17:16,608 --> 01:17:18,978
This is the real desert. This is real.

1889
01:17:19,938 --> 01:17:21,348
There's really nothing out there but sand.

1890
01:17:24,238 --> 01:17:27,438
(Welcome to the desert. You've never been desert before, right?)

1891
01:17:27,508 --> 01:17:30,778
(Welcome to the desert. You've never been desert before, right?)

1892
01:17:30,978 --> 01:17:37,038
(There are only the four vehicles and sand winds in the desert.)

1893
01:17:37,138 --> 01:17:38,508
I see nothing out there.

1894
01:17:39,138 --> 01:17:42,038
You'll never find a way out if you get lost here.

1895
01:17:42,608 --> 01:17:43,608
Right.

1896
01:17:44,138 --> 01:17:45,978
That's true.

1897
01:17:46,348 --> 01:17:47,978
- This desert is endless. - And nobody's here.

1898
01:17:49,138 --> 01:17:50,308
We won't be able to find a way out if we get lost.

1899
01:17:50,348 --> 01:17:52,108
(There's neither ways nor directions in this huge sand field.)

1900
01:17:52,138 --> 01:17:53,308
And we sleep here tonight?

1901
01:17:54,238 --> 01:17:55,978
(Kwang Soo is nervous.)

1902
01:18:01,608 --> 01:18:05,138
- This is the real desert. - This is what we call desert.

1903
01:18:05,608 --> 01:18:07,038
- Gosh. - We're right in the middle.

1904
01:18:07,138 --> 01:18:08,608
I've never been to place like this before.

1905
01:18:11,138 --> 01:18:12,408
- Look at that. - Okay.

1906
01:18:15,778 --> 01:18:16,778
Wow!

1907
01:18:17,608 --> 01:18:18,608
I've never seen such animal before.

1908
01:18:18,878 --> 01:18:20,878
- My goodness. - It's amazing.

1909
01:18:20,938 --> 01:18:25,238
(Antelope is similar to deer and inhabits in Africa and the Mideast.)

1910
01:18:25,308 --> 01:18:26,848
They look great.

1911
01:18:27,308 --> 01:18:28,408
They look fabulous.

1912
01:18:29,348 --> 01:18:32,238
- They are like impalas. - That's what I thought.

1913
01:18:32,308 --> 01:18:33,778
They will run away if we chase after them.

1914
01:18:33,778 --> 01:18:34,978
(They might run away if we chase after them.)

1915
01:18:36,608 --> 01:18:38,508
(It's bumpy.)

1916
01:18:40,208 --> 01:18:43,308
(It's getting bumpier as they go toward the centre of the desert.)

1917
01:18:43,848 --> 01:18:45,608
- It's not dangerous. Relax. - Wait.

1918
01:18:45,848 --> 01:18:49,608
(Are we riding a roller coaster?)

1919
01:18:49,708 --> 01:18:50,778
Goodness.

1920
01:18:54,208 --> 01:18:55,978
- It's about to overturn. - Gosh.

1921
01:18:56,808 --> 01:18:57,848
- My goodness. - Oh, dear.

1922
01:18:57,938 --> 01:18:59,708
It's almost overturned.

1923
01:19:02,038 --> 01:19:04,108
Is he heading to the cliff?

1924
01:19:04,408 --> 01:19:05,878
- Are you serious? - Gosh!

1925
01:19:06,808 --> 01:19:11,038
(Drivers deflate tires to lessen impact in rough and bumpy deserts.)

1926
01:19:11,138 --> 01:19:13,478
(They automatically hold on to the handle.)

1927
01:19:13,848 --> 01:19:15,848
- Gosh, look at that. - Stop!

1928
01:19:18,978 --> 01:19:21,238
(I just got back from the zipline.)

1929
01:19:21,238 --> 01:19:22,578
This is insane.

1930
01:19:22,678 --> 01:19:24,578
(We just came back from skydiving.)

1931
01:19:25,578 --> 01:19:26,808
(He doesn't even have a handle.)

1932
01:19:26,848 --> 01:19:28,478
I don't even have a handle.

1933
01:19:28,538 --> 01:19:29,848
Someone broke it.

1934
01:19:30,238 --> 01:19:32,108
- Do you have one? - No, we don't.

1935
01:19:32,138 --> 01:19:33,478
It's broken.

1936
01:19:34,138 --> 01:19:35,738
Oh, gosh!

1937
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:39,138
The car will flip.

1938
01:19:39,238 --> 01:19:40,638
Look out!

1939
01:19:40,678 --> 01:19:44,938
(Kwang Soo is freaking out.)

1940
01:19:46,538 --> 01:19:47,578
Wait, not that way.

1941
01:19:47,638 --> 01:19:49,138
It's dangerous.

1942
01:19:49,238 --> 01:19:50,238
It's really dangerous.

1943
01:19:51,738 --> 01:19:52,738
Gosh.

1944
01:19:52,978 --> 01:19:54,038
(What a scaredy-cat!)

1945
01:19:54,138 --> 01:19:55,738
It became almost a right angle.

1946
01:19:57,108 --> 01:19:59,978
- So this is Dubai. - Now, I feel like I'm in Dubai.

1947
01:20:00,938 --> 01:20:02,478
(Gosh!)

1948
01:20:03,038 --> 01:20:05,578
(How far are we going?)

1949
01:20:05,638 --> 01:20:08,238
(How far are we going?)

1950
01:20:11,678 --> 01:20:13,678
(He misses his mum.)

1951
01:20:14,538 --> 01:20:16,038
We'll have an accident.

1952
01:20:16,138 --> 01:20:17,478
Look at this.

1953
01:20:17,578 --> 01:20:20,238
(Screaming the whole way)

1954
01:20:20,238 --> 01:20:22,478
- Oh, no. - Kwang Soo.

1955
01:20:22,538 --> 01:20:25,938
(Driving through the golden sands)

1956
01:20:26,108 --> 01:20:30,938
(They finally arrive at their destination.)

1957
01:20:33,348 --> 01:20:35,038
(Wow!)

1958
01:20:38,348 --> 01:20:40,638
- Wow. - This is amazing.

1959
01:20:40,848 --> 01:20:45,638
(They're amazed by the golden sunset and endless desert.)

1960
01:20:46,138 --> 01:20:48,108
Don't tell me we are sleeping here.

1961
01:20:48,138 --> 01:20:50,238
Seok Jin, why don't you start putting up a tent?

1962
01:20:50,938 --> 01:20:52,938
(Seok Jin got only three stamps.)

1963
01:20:52,978 --> 01:20:55,478
You should get more time to sleep.

1964
01:20:55,578 --> 01:20:56,938
You're no better than me.

1965
01:20:56,978 --> 01:20:59,678
- I have six. - There's no big difference.

1966
01:20:59,848 --> 01:21:01,348
Kwang Soo also got only three stamps.

1967
01:21:01,348 --> 01:21:03,138
You two should start putting up tents.

1968
01:21:03,238 --> 01:21:05,348
No, it's too early to give up.

1969
01:21:05,578 --> 01:21:08,478
You will be playing three rounds of this game.

1970
01:21:09,138 --> 01:21:12,038
The winner will get three stamps.

1971
01:21:12,138 --> 01:21:13,478
- I should win. - Wow.

1972
01:21:13,538 --> 01:21:15,238
You can win up to nine stamps.

1973
01:21:15,348 --> 01:21:16,638
- So there's still a chance. - All right.

1974
01:21:16,678 --> 01:21:18,678
Those who skydived are sleeping at the hotel, right?

1975
01:21:18,938 --> 01:21:21,138
You can just sit back and relax.

1976
01:21:22,038 --> 01:21:24,108
They will be sitting back and enjoying the game.

1977
01:21:24,138 --> 01:21:27,038
The rule is simple. We'll get ready.

1978
01:21:27,138 --> 01:21:28,348
(Who will be able to reverse the situation?)

1979
01:21:30,238 --> 01:21:32,238
(The last game for the stamps is "Shoes Race")

1980
01:21:32,348 --> 01:21:35,738
You will first run toward the boxes over there.

1981
01:21:36,038 --> 01:21:39,348
You'll choose one among them and open it.

1982
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:40,478
And then?

1983
01:21:40,738 --> 01:21:43,638
In the boxes are various kinds of shoes which you'll have to wear.

1984
01:21:44,738 --> 01:21:48,108
Whoever takes the flag first with the shoes on will be the winner.

1985
01:21:48,138 --> 01:21:50,038
(If you win all 3 rounds, you'll get 9 stamps.)

1986
01:21:50,108 --> 01:21:51,978
It feels so nice to walk on the sands.

1987
01:21:52,738 --> 01:21:55,678
Then why don't you sleep in the sands tonight?

1988
01:21:56,348 --> 01:21:58,238
- Are you kidding me? - That's a good idea.

1989
01:21:59,138 --> 01:22:00,348
- Are you ready? - Yes.

1990
01:22:00,478 --> 01:22:01,938
Which shoes you choose matters the most.

1991
01:22:02,038 --> 01:22:03,538
You're right. It's random.

1992
01:22:03,578 --> 01:22:06,138
You have to be wearing the shoes when you pull out the flag.

1993
01:22:06,138 --> 01:22:07,848
Leave me alone.

1994
01:22:07,938 --> 01:22:09,738
- This is so annoying. - What's wrong?

1995
01:22:09,738 --> 01:22:11,578
- I'll just sleep here. - Where are you going?

1996
01:22:11,678 --> 01:22:13,578
- This is annoying. - Fine.

1997
01:22:13,678 --> 01:22:15,678
- They're trying so hard to stop me. - Just do it.

1998
01:22:15,738 --> 01:22:17,678
- Let's just do it. - Just do it.

1999
01:22:17,938 --> 01:22:20,108
- Let's start. - Don't do it from the beginning.

2000
01:22:20,238 --> 01:22:21,738
- Ready. - Don't take away others.

2001
01:22:21,848 --> 01:22:22,848
Ready.

2002
01:22:25,138 --> 01:22:27,108
(Oops)

2003
01:22:27,138 --> 01:22:28,848
They're so desperate.

2004
01:22:28,878 --> 01:22:31,038
- Gosh. - Didn't you say you give up?

2005
01:22:31,138 --> 01:22:33,138
- I should at least try it. - He's desperate.

2006
01:22:33,348 --> 01:22:34,848
- Seok Jin, step back. - Okay.

2007
01:22:35,138 --> 01:22:36,478
Ready, go.

2008
01:22:36,538 --> 01:22:37,848
(Start)

2009
01:22:38,848 --> 01:22:39,848
(Racing)

2010
01:22:41,348 --> 01:22:42,348
Gary is fast.

2011
01:22:42,478 --> 01:22:44,138
(Gary opens a box first.)

2012
01:22:45,848 --> 01:22:46,938
(It's slippers)

2013
01:22:47,938 --> 01:22:48,938
What are these?

2014
01:22:49,538 --> 01:22:50,538
What are these?

2015
01:22:50,848 --> 01:22:52,238
(Toe socks)

2016
01:22:53,678 --> 01:22:54,738
How do I put them on?

2017
01:22:55,108 --> 01:22:56,238
(Ji Hyo got flippers.)

2018
01:22:56,348 --> 01:22:57,638
(Kwang Soo got straw shoes.)

2019
01:22:58,978 --> 01:23:01,738
(Toe socks, slippers, straw shoes, high heels, sandals and flippers)

2020
01:23:02,348 --> 01:23:03,348
What are these?

2021
01:23:04,238 --> 01:23:05,238
How do I put them on?

2022
01:23:05,938 --> 01:23:06,938
(Struggling)

2023
01:23:07,038 --> 01:23:08,038
Wait.

2024
01:23:08,138 --> 01:23:09,138
What are these?

2025
01:23:09,238 --> 01:23:11,848
(Jae Seok seemed not interested, but he's the fastest to wear heels.)

2026
01:23:11,878 --> 01:23:12,978
(Run!)

2027
01:23:15,238 --> 01:23:16,738
(Jae Seok rushes forward.)

2028
01:23:17,738 --> 01:23:19,238
(Jae Seok is on the lead.)

2029
01:23:19,578 --> 01:23:20,578
(Pulling out the flag)

2030
01:23:21,478 --> 01:23:22,478
No!

2031
01:23:22,538 --> 01:23:23,938
(Jae Seok wins the round and gets three stamps.)

2032
01:23:23,978 --> 01:23:26,678
- I had to wear flippers. - I chose a good one.

2033
01:23:26,808 --> 01:23:28,348
- What is Jae Seok wearing? - Nice!

2034
01:23:28,938 --> 01:23:30,038
- Look at you. - That's amazing.

2035
01:23:30,108 --> 01:23:32,738
You should've prepared bigger ones.

2036
01:23:32,848 --> 01:23:34,348
- It's too small for me. - Look at him!

2037
01:23:34,738 --> 01:23:36,808
- You ran so hard. - Let's go for another round.

2038
01:23:37,978 --> 01:23:39,978
I just need to win one more time.

2039
01:23:40,038 --> 01:23:42,678
- Why do you run so hard? - You said you'd give up.

2040
01:23:42,738 --> 01:23:45,138
No, I never said that.

2041
01:23:45,238 --> 01:23:47,138
- Look at Jae Seok. - I could've won.

2042
01:23:47,978 --> 01:23:51,138
Come here, Kwang Soo. We're sleeping out in the desert.

2043
01:23:51,238 --> 01:23:53,138
(Seok Jin and Kwang Soo are sleeping out in the desert tonight.)

2044
01:23:55,138 --> 01:23:56,808
- Let's just do it. - It's pure luck.

2045
01:23:56,848 --> 01:23:58,138
It's okay to sleep here.

2046
01:23:58,138 --> 01:23:59,678
- It's no big deal. - Have you ever slept in a desert?

2047
01:23:59,738 --> 01:24:01,348
When will we sleep in a desert again?

2048
01:24:01,738 --> 01:24:02,738
Ready.

2049
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:04,138
Hurry!

2050
01:24:04,138 --> 01:24:05,678
Look how focused Jae Seok is.

2051
01:24:05,738 --> 01:24:06,938
Jae Seok is really into this game.

2052
01:24:07,238 --> 01:24:08,238
Ready.

2053
01:24:08,348 --> 01:24:10,108
(I'll win again...)

2054
01:24:10,738 --> 01:24:11,848
(and sleep at the hotel tonight.)

2055
01:24:12,478 --> 01:24:13,578
(I want to sleep at the hotel, too.)

2056
01:24:14,348 --> 01:24:15,738
(I have to win two rounds to sleep at the hotel.)

2057
01:24:20,738 --> 01:24:22,578
(Racing)

2058
01:24:23,578 --> 01:24:25,848
- They're fast. - Gary is fast.

2059
01:24:25,878 --> 01:24:26,938
He's fast.

2060
01:24:27,578 --> 01:24:28,738
(It's time to choose a box.)

2061
01:24:29,738 --> 01:24:30,848
What is this?

2062
01:24:30,878 --> 01:24:32,348
(Gary chose slippers again.)

2063
01:24:33,738 --> 01:24:35,348
(Ji Hyo chose high heels.)

2064
01:24:35,738 --> 01:24:37,538
- Gary is fast. - What is this?

2065
01:24:37,578 --> 01:24:39,348
(Haha chose sandals.)

2066
01:24:40,938 --> 01:24:42,578
(Jae Seok chose toe socks.)

2067
01:24:42,638 --> 01:24:43,848
He's fast.

2068
01:24:44,978 --> 01:24:47,238
(Jae Seok falls behind.)

2069
01:24:47,578 --> 01:24:49,878
- What is this? - He got socks.

2070
01:24:50,348 --> 01:24:52,478
(Haha's shoes came off.)

2071
01:24:52,578 --> 01:24:53,578
Wait.

2072
01:24:53,938 --> 01:24:56,138
(Now, it's a competition between Monday Couple.)

2073
01:24:57,478 --> 01:24:58,678
(I don't mind sleeping in a desert.)

2074
01:25:00,138 --> 01:25:02,578
(Are you sure you want to compete with me?)

2075
01:25:04,038 --> 01:25:06,348
(They are against each other.)

2076
01:25:06,848 --> 01:25:08,038
Ji Hyo.

2077
01:25:08,348 --> 01:25:09,478
(What?)

2078
01:25:11,848 --> 01:25:13,038
(Flying)

2079
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:15,038
(He flew to the flag.)

2080
01:25:15,848 --> 01:25:17,238
(What did I just see?)

2081
01:25:19,238 --> 01:25:20,238
Ji Hyo.

2082
01:25:20,348 --> 01:25:22,738
(Gary wins the round.)

2083
01:25:24,678 --> 01:25:26,238
(She's upset.)

2084
01:25:26,348 --> 01:25:27,578
He's mean.

2085
01:25:27,878 --> 01:25:29,738
- That was so mean. - That's not gentle.

2086
01:25:30,678 --> 01:25:32,578
(He's such a jerk.)

2087
01:25:35,348 --> 01:25:39,348
(He used to be so nice to her.)

2088
01:25:39,478 --> 01:25:40,738
(Is he really the same person?)

2089
01:25:40,848 --> 01:25:43,138
- It's pretty, isn't it? - It's as pretty as you.

2090
01:25:46,238 --> 01:25:48,138
(Sorry, I'm allergic to sand.)

2091
01:25:48,138 --> 01:25:49,578
- That was so mean. - That's not gentle.

2092
01:25:50,678 --> 01:25:53,238
(He's so happy to win the round.)

2093
01:25:53,638 --> 01:25:55,138
- Are you happy? - Shame on you.

2094
01:25:55,238 --> 01:25:57,848
- He swung himself. - Monday Couple is about to break.

2095
01:25:57,878 --> 01:26:00,238
I was too focused on the game.

2096
01:26:00,978 --> 01:26:03,038
Why did it have to be Ji Hyo?

2097
01:26:03,478 --> 01:26:04,478
(Forget it.)

2098
01:26:04,538 --> 01:26:05,578
(I have sand in my mouth.)

2099
01:26:05,638 --> 01:26:06,938
Seriously.

2100
01:26:06,978 --> 01:26:10,738
(How could you do that to me?)

2101
01:26:11,578 --> 01:26:12,848
(Punishing)

2102
01:26:12,878 --> 01:26:14,348
How could you slide like that?

2103
01:26:15,348 --> 01:26:18,138
You threw yourself to get the flag.

2104
01:26:18,238 --> 01:26:19,238
I...

2105
01:26:19,638 --> 01:26:21,578
I couldn't help it.

2106
01:26:23,348 --> 01:26:25,738
(They only got annoyed and upset by playing the race.)

2107
01:26:27,138 --> 01:26:29,138
Gary goes to the hotel.

2108
01:26:29,238 --> 01:26:30,478
I'm embarrassed.

2109
01:26:30,538 --> 01:26:31,578
(Gary gets to sleep at the hotel.)

2110
01:26:31,638 --> 01:26:33,578
We'll never forget your sliding.

2111
01:26:33,638 --> 01:26:35,348
He completely threw himself.

2112
01:26:35,478 --> 01:26:37,238
In addition to that,

2113
01:26:37,348 --> 01:26:39,038
when he threw himself,

2114
01:26:39,348 --> 01:26:41,738
I got all the sand in my face.

2115
01:26:43,478 --> 01:26:44,578
(He's sorry.)

2116
01:26:44,738 --> 01:26:46,138
Jong Kook gets to sleep at the hotel.

2117
01:26:46,138 --> 01:26:47,538
- Thank you. - Da Hey, too.

2118
01:26:47,578 --> 01:26:49,138
Il Woo gets to sleep at the hotel.

2119
01:26:49,138 --> 01:26:51,848
- I'm so happy. - Ji Hyo, too.

2120
01:26:51,878 --> 01:26:53,348
- It's no big deal. - Do you have any objection?

2121
01:26:53,478 --> 01:26:54,848
- No. - The result is so obvious.

2122
01:26:54,938 --> 01:26:57,678
It turned out exactly how we predicted.

2123
01:26:57,738 --> 01:27:00,108
- What did I tell you? - Our prediction...

2124
01:27:00,348 --> 01:27:01,478
turned out to be exactly correct.

2125
01:27:01,578 --> 01:27:04,348
It's the same members in Taiwan special.

2126
01:27:04,478 --> 01:27:06,138
It's the exactly same members.

2127
01:27:06,238 --> 01:27:07,238
You're right.

2128
01:27:07,738 --> 01:27:08,938
We went on a rollercoaster ride together.

2129
01:27:09,848 --> 01:27:11,738
Okay, those who sleep at the hotel...

2130
01:27:12,108 --> 01:27:14,138
will now head to the hotel.

2131
01:27:14,738 --> 01:27:15,738
- Now? - Already?

2132
01:27:16,138 --> 01:27:17,538
- Really? - It's unbelievable.

2133
01:27:17,578 --> 01:27:18,738
All right.

2134
01:27:18,848 --> 01:27:20,838
- To the hotel? - Are we leaving them behind?

2135
01:27:20,878 --> 01:27:22,038
Yes. Leave them behind.

2136
01:27:22,138 --> 01:27:23,938
- Gosh. - Okay.

2137
01:27:24,138 --> 01:27:25,678
Won't you get sick tomorrow?

2138
01:27:25,738 --> 01:27:27,678
- We will. - We sure will.

2139
01:27:27,738 --> 01:27:29,578
We might even get into a fight.

2140
01:27:30,138 --> 01:27:31,338
The four of us.

2141
01:27:31,478 --> 01:27:33,038
Four of us might end up being three.

2142
01:27:33,108 --> 01:27:34,138
Exactly.

2143
01:27:34,578 --> 01:27:35,738
Wait and see what happens.

2144
01:27:36,478 --> 01:27:38,478
- I feel bad. - It's okay. You can go.

2145
01:27:38,578 --> 01:27:39,738
Don't worry. You can go.

2146
01:27:39,738 --> 01:27:40,838
(They should head to the hotel now.)

2147
01:27:40,938 --> 01:27:43,138
(It's time to say goodbye.)

2148
01:27:43,138 --> 01:27:44,238
I feel so bad.

2149
01:27:44,338 --> 01:27:46,138
- Is Il Woo staying? - Go.

2150
01:27:46,238 --> 01:27:48,038
I know how you feel, but you should go.

2151
01:27:48,108 --> 01:27:49,678
(They're going back to the civilised world.)

2152
01:27:49,738 --> 01:27:51,238
- Good night. - See you.

2153
01:27:51,338 --> 01:27:53,108
Bring some breakfast for us.

2154
01:27:53,138 --> 01:27:54,638
You should bring us some food.

2155
01:27:54,678 --> 01:27:57,108
- See you. - Have some chocolate.

2156
01:27:57,138 --> 01:27:58,578
(The survival starts.)

2157
01:27:59,578 --> 01:28:01,978
- Give it to me! - Let go!

2158
01:28:02,038 --> 01:28:03,138
Go away.

2159
01:28:03,238 --> 01:28:05,138
- I haven't eaten all day! - Give me some, too!

2160
01:28:05,638 --> 01:28:07,238
(They have...)

2161
01:28:07,338 --> 01:28:09,238
(completely adapted...)

2162
01:28:09,338 --> 01:28:10,838
(to the wild.)

2163
01:28:13,478 --> 01:28:15,338
(Let's go back to the civilised world.)

2164
01:28:15,478 --> 01:28:16,478
See you.

2165
01:28:17,838 --> 01:28:22,038
(The chocolate is mine.)

2166
01:28:22,138 --> 01:28:23,638
- Get him! - Get him!

2167
01:28:23,678 --> 01:28:24,678
No!

2168
01:28:24,738 --> 01:28:26,478
- See you. - Bye!

2169
01:28:27,878 --> 01:28:31,478
(Jae Seok, Seok Jin, Kwang Soo and Haha will sleep out at the desert.)

2170
01:28:34,238 --> 01:28:36,678
I even brought my swimming pants. I thought I'd stay at a hotel.

2171
01:28:36,808 --> 01:28:38,038
Wait.

2172
01:28:38,338 --> 01:28:39,478
Make sure...

2173
01:28:39,738 --> 01:28:41,478
you don't stray far.

2174
01:28:42,038 --> 01:28:43,138
You might die.

2175
01:28:43,138 --> 01:28:44,578
- What? - What are you saying?

2176
01:28:44,638 --> 01:28:47,138
- Why do you say something so scary? - Seriously.

2177
01:28:47,138 --> 01:28:48,538
Listen to me.

2178
01:28:48,578 --> 01:28:49,978
- What are you talking about? - Wait.

2179
01:28:50,038 --> 01:28:53,038
Have you ever been in a situation like this?

2180
01:28:53,138 --> 01:28:55,038
- You might die. - There might be animals.

2181
01:28:55,138 --> 01:28:56,938
Will there be snakes?

2182
01:28:57,238 --> 01:28:59,838
- What about desert foxes? - Not snakes.

2183
01:29:01,238 --> 01:29:03,478
What is it called? The ones with the unique tail.

2184
01:29:03,538 --> 01:29:04,578
That's a kind of snakes.

2185
01:29:05,138 --> 01:29:06,938
But that kind is only found in North America.

2186
01:29:07,838 --> 01:29:09,338
- You're an expert. - He knows a lot!

2187
01:29:09,478 --> 01:29:10,508
- I told you. - He's like someone from...

2188
01:29:10,578 --> 01:29:11,708
the "Discovery Channel".

2189
01:29:11,878 --> 01:29:14,238
I'm an expert at survival tactics.

2190
01:29:14,708 --> 01:29:17,538
You should know that in extreme situations,

2191
01:29:17,938 --> 01:29:19,238
not all four of us can survive.

2192
01:29:19,738 --> 01:29:21,738
- We need to abandon one. - We should kill one.

2193
01:29:22,638 --> 01:29:24,308
(The survival expert is bringing up the biggest risk factor.)

2194
01:29:24,338 --> 01:29:26,238
- I'm not kidding. - What have we done so wrong today?

2195
01:29:26,308 --> 01:29:27,538
Let's abandon him.

2196
01:29:28,038 --> 01:29:29,708
- He doesn't do anything anyway. - He must be useful in some ways.

2197
01:29:29,738 --> 01:29:31,938
It was just an example.

2198
01:29:31,938 --> 01:29:34,638
I was saying it so we're determined to stick together until the end.

2199
01:29:34,708 --> 01:29:37,238
- All together. - Let's not give up.

2200
01:29:37,308 --> 01:29:39,508
- All right. - Let's not betray each other, okay?

2201
01:29:39,538 --> 01:29:41,138
- In 1, 2 and 3. Let's go. - Let's go!

2202
01:29:41,238 --> 01:29:42,838
(Good luck with sleeping outside!)

2203
01:29:42,938 --> 01:29:44,678
(Will they really not betray each other?)

2204
01:29:46,116 --> 01:29:48,816
(After driving quite a distance,)

2205
01:29:48,886 --> 01:29:51,416
(they arrived at the hotel in the middle of the desert.)

2206
01:29:51,516 --> 01:29:53,416
- That's really a good thing. - You see?

2207
01:29:53,516 --> 01:29:55,516
I thought about it on the way here.

2208
01:29:56,116 --> 01:29:57,686
Although I didn't win a lot,

2209
01:29:58,116 --> 01:29:59,216
I always manage to avoid the worst.

2210
01:30:00,516 --> 01:30:02,116
- Is this it? - Thank you.

2211
01:30:03,316 --> 01:30:04,316
Thank you.

2212
01:30:07,016 --> 01:30:08,516
This must be the hotel.

2213
01:30:09,916 --> 01:30:10,916
(In the middle of the desert)

2214
01:30:10,986 --> 01:30:12,216
- Oh my goodness. - Really?

2215
01:30:12,416 --> 01:30:13,686
(The finest hotel is located right next to the desert.)

2216
01:30:13,716 --> 01:30:15,516
If you just open the door, you can see the desert.

2217
01:30:15,616 --> 01:30:16,616
(If you just open the door, you can see desert.)

2218
01:30:16,686 --> 01:30:18,616
- It's right next to the bedroom. - Gosh!

2219
01:30:18,686 --> 01:30:19,886
This is too luxurious.

2220
01:30:20,986 --> 01:30:23,916
This is a feast we've prepared for you.

2221
01:30:23,986 --> 01:30:26,216
- Please enjoy it comfortably. - Wow.

2222
01:30:26,786 --> 01:30:27,816
A feast for us?

2223
01:30:28,416 --> 01:30:30,416
- Is this a buffet? - Come and take...

2224
01:30:30,516 --> 01:30:31,716
a glass of water for each of you.

2225
01:30:31,786 --> 01:30:33,316
We'll enjoy the food as we settle down.

2226
01:30:33,416 --> 01:30:34,816
Is it really a buffet?

2227
01:30:35,256 --> 01:30:37,686
- Look at this. - It looks so pretty.

2228
01:30:38,116 --> 01:30:40,016
What is this? It's like steamed eggs.

2229
01:30:40,516 --> 01:30:42,516
I want to take some to them.

2230
01:30:42,616 --> 01:30:44,716
Yes, I want to take some to my mother.

2231
01:30:45,116 --> 01:30:47,216
(He's a good son.)

2232
01:30:48,016 --> 01:30:50,316
(It all looks tasty.)

2233
01:30:50,316 --> 01:30:52,086
It looks enough to serve eight couples.

2234
01:30:53,686 --> 01:30:55,786
- I think I was too greedy. - How is it?

2235
01:30:56,316 --> 01:30:58,816
- It tastes good. - This is tasty.

2236
01:30:59,516 --> 01:31:02,356
- I didn't expect it to be. - It's so delicious.

2237
01:31:02,416 --> 01:31:04,016
So out there is the desert?

2238
01:31:04,086 --> 01:31:05,916
- That's right. - I see.

2239
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:11,256
I should check that out after dinner.

2240
01:31:11,316 --> 01:31:12,616
This place is very romantic.

2241
01:31:13,216 --> 01:31:15,316
It's a great place for couples.

2242
01:31:15,816 --> 01:31:18,216
I feel like I'm an outsider between two couples.

2243
01:31:20,016 --> 01:31:21,216
(What is he saying?)

2244
01:31:21,616 --> 01:31:23,116
Don't say that.

2245
01:31:23,156 --> 01:31:26,716
(They enjoyed their wonderful dinner at the hotel.)

2246
01:31:26,816 --> 01:31:28,916
Let's take a picture to remember this night.

2247
01:31:28,986 --> 01:31:29,986
Okay.

2248
01:31:30,116 --> 01:31:32,816
- This camera turns 360-degrees. - Okay.

2249
01:31:33,416 --> 01:31:35,216
- All the staff will be in it. - Okay.

2250
01:31:35,516 --> 01:31:37,216
In 1, 2 and 3.

2251
01:31:37,616 --> 01:31:38,886
(Click)

2252
01:31:40,516 --> 01:31:41,816
- That was short. - Yes.

2253
01:31:41,916 --> 01:31:44,416
- It still captured everything. - Really?

2254
01:31:44,916 --> 01:31:46,786
(Spinning around)

2255
01:31:48,416 --> 01:31:49,416
Look here.

2256
01:31:49,416 --> 01:31:50,416
(They can't take their eyes of the photo.)

2257
01:31:51,886 --> 01:31:53,256
- I think I'll have some more. - You can even zoom in.

2258
01:31:53,316 --> 01:31:54,716
You can see me.

2259
01:31:56,816 --> 01:31:57,986
It's really all in that photo.

2260
01:31:58,056 --> 01:32:00,216
You can also do this to see just the sky.

2261
01:32:05,016 --> 01:32:06,416
(Tonight,)

2262
01:32:07,916 --> 01:32:10,216
(the songs of the shooting stars...)

2263
01:32:10,256 --> 01:32:13,916
(awaken the myth kept in the desert.)
