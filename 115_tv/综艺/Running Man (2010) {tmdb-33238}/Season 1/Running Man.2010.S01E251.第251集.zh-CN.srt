Joong Ki wanted to say hi
after the discharge

but he didn't have much time
due to his drama and what not.

Were you this kind of a person?

249

Anyway, Joong Ki came to say
hi after he got discharged

250
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,120
and he's going to get busier

251
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,550
so he probably wouldn't
have been able to come

252
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,400
but he wanted to say hi
so he came all the way.

253
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,200

with Joong Ki so they came.

267
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,460
and next time, I'll come with
In Sung since he's not busy.

She always asked me for my signature

I've been on SBS a few times
because of dramas

doesn't allow it...

we'll just bring him
when we bring Joong Ki.

00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,750
- Coffee and some snacks.

And since Joong Ki's back,
I hope he can say hello elsewhere, too.

grandfather's house and took a walk.

Then, she must be a singer.

1015

No, she wasn't.
She's not a singer.

1016
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,780
Why would you practice
together if she's not a singer?

1017
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,780
She just visited my practice room.

1018
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:45,640
I stayed at the practice room
most of the time.

00:57:48,550 --> 00:57:50,550
That's great.

1123
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:54,580
On your tenth anniversary,
you should read it back to him

1124
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:56,890
in his ears.

1125
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:59,210
Next is So Hyun's turn.

1126
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:02,100
A credit card with a lowered limit.

1127
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,630
You didn't like that credit card?

1128
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:09,010
How much was the limit?

1129
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:12,000
It was when we just started dating.

1130
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,240
He made a credit card and gave it to me.

1131
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:19,490
He told me to use it all I want
and I was really happy.

1132
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:22,400
It means he thinks of me
more than just a girlfriend.

1133
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,650
He thinks of you as a family.

1134
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:27,230
I was so happy that I
couldn't use the credit card.

1135
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:30,350
Later, I found out about the
credit limit and it surprised me.

1136
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:33,660
Was it because the limit was too little?

1137
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:37,150
No, it's because it's really
impressive when you receive it.

1138
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:40,320
But when you find out about the limit,
it feels like a betrayal.

1139
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:44,150
It feels like that's how
much he can trust me.

1140
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:47,270
She wasn't going to
go over the limit at all...

1141
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:49,200
Let me explain.

1142
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:53,750
- Was it a joke?
- No, I met her at my debut musical.

1143
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:55,980
I was a student right before the time.

1144
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:59,670
Three hundred thousand won
was all I had and I gave her that.

1145
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:05,000
- He gave his everything.
- But he made a credit card for her.

1146
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,750
He didn't have much
but he still did it.

1147
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:10,350
I still have the note he
put on the credit card.

1148
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:11,730
What did he write?

1149
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:15,550
Put away your credit card,
and use this card.

1150
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:16,630
He's romantic.

1151
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:20,200
He was going to increase the limit then!

1152
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,750
I hate it the most.

1153
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:26,630
This romantic situation,
I really don't know what to do.

1154
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:31,290
I can't stand it when a
romantic scene comes on TV.

1155
00:59:31,290 --> 00:59:35,260
- I like it.
- Are you trying to become like Sean?

1156
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:38,200
Sean or Cha In Pyo?

1157
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,890
That's amazing.
He's amazing.

1158
00:59:40,890 --> 00:59:44,890
Son Jun Ho is the new model husband now.

1159
00:59:44,890 --> 00:59:47,240
- The title moves.
- I'm not romantic.

1160
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,780
He cursed...

1161
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:50,800
It's Ji Suk Jin.

1162
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:56,430
One of the most disappointing
gifts I received was...

1163
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:59,120
a bamboo wife!
(A long bamboo bolster)

1164
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:04,500
A bamboo wife!

1165
01:00:05,350 --> 01:00:08,750
[After the 'old palace, '
no one else wrote it.]

1166
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:12,270
If you want to use a bamboo wife,
make sure to wear your pj's.

1167
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:16,100
- Did you get marks?
- It's not smooth.

1168
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,890
- Don't they leave marks?
- Yes.

1169
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:21,830
Next is Ji Hyo.

1170
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:25,240
A gift that I don't
want to receive is...

1171
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,580
a song.

1172
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:31,950
- A song?
- A love song?

1173
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:35,750
- Are you talking to Gary?
- A song recorded on a cassette tape!

1174
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:38,980
- That counts, too.
- Yes.

1175
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:42,290
Oh, when a guy sings
while looking at your eyes?

1176
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:46,270
<i>What should I do?
I fell in love with her.</i>

1177
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:50,580
<i>Where are you?
What are you doing?</i>

1178
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:53,180
<i>I love you.</i>

1179
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:56,810
<i>Please let me love you.</i>

1180
01:00:57,750 --> 01:00:59,030
[She can't stand it.]

1181
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,090
<i>Ji Hyo is so pretty.</i>

1182
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,980
[Putting her name in
the song is the worst.]

1183
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:07,840
<i>Ji Hyo is my woman.</i>

1184
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:11,800
<i>- Hyo...
- Stop it!</i>

1185
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,460
It's unctuous!

1186
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:15,490
Stop it!

1187
01:01:15,490 --> 01:01:19,260
How about you?
Do you sing to each other?

1188
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:21,580
I haven't, but Jun Ho did.

1189
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:24,720
I sang many times.
I played piano and sang for her.

1190
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,430
- What did you sing?
- Ji Hyo hates it.

1191
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:31,920
At home, she was upset because of me.

1192
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,350
So, I casually started to sing...

1193
01:01:34,350 --> 01:01:38,460
<i>I'm the only man to you.</i>

1194
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:42,320
Excuse me, you do that at home?

1195
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:46,150
- You do it at home?
- How does your wife react?

1196
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:48,580
I think she might start singing too.

1197
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:51,800
I actually like this kind of stuff.

1198
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,090
He says romantic stuff.

1199
01:01:54,090 --> 01:01:57,780
- What does he say?
- You know, when I'm upset...

1200
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:01,230
[What could it be?]

1201
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:04,210
When she's sullen, I say,
'Please look at me.'

1202
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:08,810
'I know you have a
beautiful profile, but still...'

1203
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:14,090
- That's not too bad.
- But he's not shallow.

1204
01:02:14,090 --> 01:02:15,750
He's very romantic.

1205
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:18,750
He actually uses the lines from a drama.

1206
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:22,520
- They're a match made in heaven.
- That's right.

1207
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:26,240
It's almost done.

1208
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,520
Let's just play until
we have the third place.

1209
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:31,070
One of the gifts that I don't want is...

1210
01:02:31,070 --> 01:02:33,150
- flower!
- I knew it.

1211
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,060
- I made it!
- You did?

1212
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:40,290
- Song Ji Hyo!
- They've got the second place.

1213
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:42,070
[Ji Hyo and Gary placed the second.]

1214
01:02:43,290 --> 01:02:45,870
You still have a chance for third place.

1215
01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:47,230
Third place.

1216
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:50,830
Honey, are you okay?

1217
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:53,870
You need to meet a good partner.

1218
01:02:55,210 --> 01:02:58,000
By the way, I thought
women like flowers.

1219
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,440
Women don't like flowers,
don't give them something like that.

1220
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:05,550
They like it if you give her
a big bunch of Baby's breath

1221
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:07,890
when they're with all their girlfriends.

1222
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:09,920
Why don't you do it?

1223
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,380
Just do it!

1224
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:14,890
You always hold dumbbells, not flowers.

1225
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:19,780
Next is Lee Kwang Soo.

1226
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:25,750
Kwang Soo, just call one
more item for me.

1227
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:32,980
[What will be Kwang Soo's word?]

1228
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:39,780
A purple sock!

1229
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:42,060
Socks!

1230
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:43,820
Okay!

1231
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,360
Socks!

1232
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:47,460
- Who has it?
- Me!

1233
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:52,320
I have it, too.
[She completes two lines.]

1234
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:55,870
Socks!
I made it!

1235
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:01,580
Ha Ha and Byul made it to third place!

1236
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:04,100
Thank you, Kwang Soo!

1237
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:08,120
[The rest of the couples
gets the water bomb again.]

1238
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:11,950
It's so cold!

1239
01:04:13,810 --> 01:04:15,750
Thank you, Kwang Soo!

1240
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:18,720
Thank you for your work!

1241
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:22,870
[The second mission is over.]

1242
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:28,520
The couple who placed first,
please come forward.

1243
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:30,780
- Jong Kook!
- Yes.

1244
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:34,260
- The first place.
- Let's pick this one.

1245
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:37,720
Another one.
Three.

1246
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:40,810
[They have eliminated 15 rings so far.]

1247
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:45,320
Pick the numbers, Gary.
[They get to eliminate seven numbers.]

1248
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:49,180
[They are being careful.]

1249
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:52,750
[They have 25 rings left.]

1250
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:58,090
Third place can
eliminate five numbers.

1251
01:04:58,090 --> 01:05:01,890
- So Hyun, did you win?
- We placed third once.

1252
01:05:01,890 --> 01:05:05,260
[17 rings left,
chasing after the first team.]

1253
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:07,180
[Their crazy mode didn't stop here.]

1254
01:05:07,630 --> 01:05:11,240
<i>Your third mission is
'The couples name tag war.'</i>

1255
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:16,230
<i>Find the key of love and
unlock your handcuffs.</i>

1256
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:19,890
<i>As soon as you unlock them</i>

1257
01:05:19,890 --> 01:05:21,950
<i>you can eliminate other
couples' name tags.</i>

1258
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:24,670
<i>Unless you unlock the handcuffs,
you can't attack.</i>

1259
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:27,290
<i>You will have to run away from others.</i>

1260
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:29,980
These handcuffs are such obstacles.

1261
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,320
[Even after Ha Ha was eliminated]

1262
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:34,860
[She was hiding and ousted Kwang Soo!]

1263
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:37,290
How do you feel being
betrayed, Kwang Soo?

1264
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:41,180
[Thanks to Ha Ha's competitive wife,
they placed second.]

1265
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:43,610
[A total of 22 rings were eliminated!]

1266
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:48,980
[Ha Ha was in a crazy mode
from the beginning.]

1267
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:51,810
[He won the pre-game.]

1268
01:05:53,410 --> 01:05:57,320
[Then his wife Byul
kept winning the first game.]

1269
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:01,890
This is a chance!

1270
01:06:02,810 --> 01:06:07,640
[They eliminated ten rings!]

1271
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:11,010
[During the second mission...]

1272
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:13,380
[they worked in perfect harmony]

1273
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:15,830
[and made it to third place again.]

1274
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:20,350
[They eliminated five more rings.]

1275
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:27,350
[And won second place at the last game.]

1276
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:29,660
<i>Ha Ha and Byul, please come forward.</i>

1277
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:32,860
In the beginning, I announced that only
the first winner can enter the finals.

1278
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:36,240
Ha Ha and Byul qualified
for the final mission.

1279
01:06:37,550 --> 01:06:39,380
The last team
for the final mission.

1280
01:06:40,290 --> 01:06:42,690
[32-story condo in Sungnam]

1281
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:45,120
Go Eun, you will be doing it first.

1282
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:47,890
Did you think you would win today?

1283
01:06:47,890 --> 01:06:50,950
What is it?

1284
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:53,780
- Oh my god.
- They covered my eyes again.

1285
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:58,830
- What is it?
- What are you doing?

1286
01:06:58,830 --> 01:07:01,120
Why do they have to do this?

1287
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:06,320
[32 numbers and 32 story building.
What kind of a mission will it be?]

1288
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:09,180
[Five people on the 15th floor.]
What is it?

1289
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:12,410
[Five people on the 16th floor.]

1290
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:17,380
What is it?

1291
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:22,060
[Cameras are installed
from the 1st to 32nd floor.]

1292
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:24,660
- What are those?
- What's going on?

1293
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:27,000
[What are the cameras for?]

1294
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,570
<i>The final mission is...</i>

1295
01:07:28,570 --> 01:07:34,400
'The Telepathy Elevator.'

1296
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:40,690
Like I said, only the first winner
can challenge the final mission.

1297
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:43,270
Ha Ha and Byul can challenge
the final mission.

1298
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:49,010
<i>The couple has to pick a number
out of all the numbers they have.</i>

1299
01:07:49,010 --> 01:07:52,150
<i>- One number.
- Just one?</i>

1300
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:53,800
Each of you

1301
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:57,240
will take a different elevator and
go to the floor of your choice.

1302
01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:02,270
You will win if you can
communicate telepathically

1303
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:06,290
and meet each other on the same floor.

1304
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:10,860
That's why it's better
to have less numbers.

1305
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:13,950
- Do they have only one chance to try?
- Yes.

1306
01:08:13,950 --> 01:08:17,550
- How is it possible?
- I have a few numbers on my mind.

1307
01:08:17,550 --> 01:08:19,690
Anyway, you have ten numbers now.

1308
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:23,060
This is a lot easier
for the real couples.

1309
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:24,230
That's right.

1310
01:08:24,230 --> 01:08:27,230
- It's not that easy.
- They can pick a special number.

1311
01:08:27,230 --> 01:08:31,870
I thought I had to memorize
all the numbers.

1312
01:08:31,950 --> 01:08:34,800
We all thought so at first.

1313
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:39,550
Just in case, we kept
more than five special numbers.

1314
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:41,430
More than five?

1315
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:45,090
Her birthday, my birthday...

1316
01:08:45,090 --> 01:08:47,060
our anniversary

1317
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:49,690
and my son's birthday.

1318
01:08:49,690 --> 01:08:53,350
Ha Ha will pick a number
and go to that floor.

1319
01:08:53,350 --> 01:08:56,830
You will go to the lobby and choose.

1320
01:08:56,830 --> 01:08:58,830
Then go to that floor.

1321
01:08:58,830 --> 01:09:00,780
Good luck!

1322
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:03,520
- You never know.
- Good luck!

1323
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:07,470
Ha Ha left a few special numbers,
I hope he picks the right one.

1324
01:09:07,470 --> 01:09:09,850
It's easier that they
have an anniversary date.

1325
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:12,230
Yes, it is.

1326
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:14,950
I think it's possible.

1327
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:17,690
[Will they be able to
read each other's mind?]

1328
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:20,800
Good luck!

1329
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:23,320
- Isn't that the song?
- I think so, too.

1330
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:26,100
- I hope it's what I'm thinking.
- December?

1331
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:29,690
- That should be the date.
- It's the date.

1332
01:09:29,690 --> 01:09:33,800
I think they will play
'Mai piu cosi lontano.'

1333
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,920
They can do it.

1334
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:39,470
Because they're married...
[Out of ten numbers...]

1335
01:09:39,470 --> 01:09:43,600
[But there's only one answer
for the two hearts!]

1336
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,920
[Nervous, anxious, and burdensome.]
This drives me nuts.

1337
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:52,140
[They came to pick a number.]

1338
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:56,550
[The same location,
but different times.]

1339
01:09:57,230 --> 01:10:00,320
But the possibility went up.

1340
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,800
Let's see.

1341
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,890
Number 20.

1342
01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:08,200
This is my birthday.

1343
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,180
August 20th.

1344
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:15,780
Ha Ha's birthday is August 20th.

1345
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:19,920
Number 22.

1346
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:25,030
Byul was born in October 22nd in 1983.

1347
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:29,660
My birthday is October 22nd.

1348
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:31,640
And...

1349
01:10:32,490 --> 01:10:37,950
30 is our wedding anniversary.

1350
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:44,150
The last number is
our wedding anniversary, 30th.

1351
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:47,430
<i>You know the story</i>

1352
01:10:47,430 --> 01:10:50,860
about the couple
who crossed dramatically.

1353
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:56,200
On Christmas day,
the wife cuts and sells her hair....

1354
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:58,120
and buys a wristband for her husband.

1355
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:03,690
Her husband sells his watch
to buy his wife a comb.

1356
01:11:04,550 --> 01:11:09,120
It's a beautiful story,
but we might do the same.

1357
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:12,040
If we go to the floors for
each other's birthday...

1358
01:11:15,290 --> 01:11:18,950
If I pick my husband's birthday

1359
01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:22,230
and he picks my birthday...

1360
01:11:22,230 --> 01:11:25,860
then we will fail.

1361
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:29,090
After what we've done
today to win this race...

1362
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:31,030
[The couple's last crisis...]

1363
01:11:31,030 --> 01:11:33,750
I've decided.

1364
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:39,200
Go Eun, I'm trying to communicate
with you telepathically.

1365
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,180
I hope you heard me.

1366
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:42,380
Honey...

1367
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:46,490
I need to speak through telepathy.

1368
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,890
[Can you hear my mind?]

1369
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:52,260
[I think he might have
picked this number.]

1370
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:55,580
I think they will succeed.

1371
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:58,610
I think so and I hope so.

1372
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:00,350
What number did you eliminate?

1373
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:02,550
I only got rid of five numbers.

1374
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:04,640
- We took out random numbers.
- Me too.

1375
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:07,580
We just got rid of one to five.

1376
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:10,060
Because we didn't think about it.

1377
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:13,580
- So I think we would win if I picked 6.
- I thought about it, too.

1378
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:16,780
No, Suk Jin might pick 'lucky seven!'

1379
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:18,980
[No way...]

1380
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:21,000
Seven?

1381
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,350
Seven?
[He is very predictable.]

1382
01:12:25,350 --> 01:12:30,090
But you stopped at five,
so Kwang Soo would pick six.

1383
01:12:30,090 --> 01:12:31,920
I'd pick 31.

1384
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:35,120
- Is it a special day?
- No, it's a random number.

1385
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:38,320
I think it's a special day.

1386
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,980
What day is it?

1387
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:43,000
What number would you pick?

1388
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,490
- I... would pick 31.
- Why?

1389
01:12:46,490 --> 01:12:48,520
So Hyun told me by telepathy.

1390
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:53,520
- For real.
- That she picked 31?

1391
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:58,660
[Ha Ha is on the way to the elevator.]
This is crazy.

1392
01:12:58,660 --> 01:13:00,950
He's on the elevator.

1393
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:03,200
He's going.

1394
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:05,150
I really hope they will meet.

1395
01:13:05,150 --> 01:13:07,630
I'm nervous.

1396
01:13:07,630 --> 01:13:10,600
<i>This is the moment...</i>

1397

<i>This is the day.</i>

1398
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:18,120
- Wow, this is...
- Very nervous.

1399
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,430
[This moment...]

<i>I hope Ha Ha meets Byul, really.</i>

1402

I have only one chance, right?

1403
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:34,720
[They have only one chance.]

1404

[They have to pick the same number.]

1406
01:13:40,230 --> 01:13:43,660
My heart is pounding.
It's very romantic.

He got off!

1410

[Kkuk put his hands together.]
How would he feel?

1411
01:13:59,870 --> 01:14:02,580
I'm so nervous.
What should I do?

1412
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,520
[After Ha Ha goes up,
Byul takes the elevator.]

[Sigh.]

[Blank Ji and So Hyun's
hearts are fluttering.]

1416

- What would Ha Ha be thinking?
- She went up!

1417
01:14:18,010 --> 01:14:20,150
She's coming, she's coming!

She's coming, coming, coming!
What should I do?

1420
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:30,260
This is a bit touching...

1421
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:32,460
It is touching.

1422
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:34,200
It's moving.

1423
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:37,030
- If it takes a while.
- She's still going up.

1424

- She's going up pretty high.
- I think they will meet.

[I hope my heart was conveyed to you.]

[Do you remember the day of
our marriage registration?]

[I proposed to you at the city hall.]

1428

Marry me.
Please be my last love.

[They started their second
life as a couple.]
