00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,850
就是為了照顧我

7
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,390
這是我的工作
It's the job.

00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,280
但是聽你這么說我很欣慰
But I appreciate that.

9
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,610
東躲西藏
The running...

10
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,310
我無法再這么做了
I can't do it anymore.

11
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,010
今天你作證之后  就不必再東躲西藏了
After you testify today, the running stops.

12
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,440
你就能重新開始生活  朱莉
You're going to get a fresh start, Julie.

她和我坐這輛無標識的車  你們在前面帶路
She rides with me in the unmarked. You guys are out front.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,180
-你們有無線電嗎  -有  當然有
- You got a radio for me? - Yeah. Of course.

20
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,410
老天  當你們提到說偏遠地區  
Man, when you guys say remote location,

21
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,030
還真沒有開玩笑啊
you're not kidding.

22
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,860
我去帶她下來
I'll go get her.

23
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,060
她在這里面
She's in here.

26
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,200

27
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,200

28
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,000

29
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,000

30
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,990

31
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,990

32
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,880

-成浩·凱利  -說

37
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,150
毫無疑問  那是
That is, without a doubt,

38
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,970
我這輩子吃過最好吃的東西
the greatest thing I've ever tasted in my life.

39
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,040
簡直是好吃到違法啊
This should be illegal, it's so good.

40
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,080
-那是什么  -可可泡芙 
- What the hell is it? - Coco puffs.

41
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,650
莉莉哈面包店每天會賣出7000份呢
Liliha Bakery sells, like, 7,000 of these a day.

42
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:19,750
棒極了
It's genius.

43
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,020
好吃  都有什么成分  黃油  奶油
It's amazing. What is it? Butter, cream,

44
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,880
巧克力  再放點黃油
chocolate, a little more butter.

45
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,560
我一直以為我這一生最后一頓飯想吃
You know, I always thought that I wanted my last meal

46
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,460
我媽媽做的千層面
to be my mother's lasagna,

47
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,090
但是那被淘汰了  不吃千層面了
but that is out. It's out. No more.

48
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,190
我要吃這個  不要甜點
I want this. I want no dessert.

49
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,920
不要開胃菜  就給我一大盒這個就行
I want no appetizer. Just a big box of these.

50
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,560
不錯
Nice.

51
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,560
蕾切爾來電

52
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,910
那不是你孩子的母親嗎
Wasn't that the mother of your child?

53
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,340
你知道史上最棒的發明是什么嗎
You know what the greatest invention of all time is?

54
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,500
-什么  -手機的忽略鍵
- What? - It's the "Ignore" button.

55
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,830
我有個理論  不管是誰
You know, I have a theory-- whoever invented

56
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,200
發生了現代手機  他肯定也有前妻
the modern cellular phone also had an ex-wife.

57
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,850
我以為你們的關系不那么僵了
I thought you guys were doing better, though.

58
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,380
是啊  她畢竟和那人還是夫妻
Yeah. But she's still married to another guy.

59
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,750
明白嗎
You know what I mean?

60
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,480
只對一個人生氣  要容易一些
I mean, it's a lot easier being angry at one person.

61
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,250
再說  蕾切爾和我  我們有共同語言
Besides, Rachel and I, we have our own language.

62
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,520
互相理解
It's an understanding.

63
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,060
她不接我的電話  我就留言留個問題
She ducks my call. I leave a message with a question.

64
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,180
她打回來  我不接
She calls me back. I duck that call.

65
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,350
她留言回答問題
She leaves an answer.

66
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,760
我們就不必在格蕾絲面前爭吵了
We don't have to argue in front of Grace.

67
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,780
-很有效  -是啊
- It all works out. - Yeah.

68
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,460
科諾
Kono?

69
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,200
都過來  伙計們
Let's go, guys.

70
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,430
有任務
We got something.

71
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,570
-什么事  -火奴魯魯警局派了兩名警官
- S'up. - All right, HPD assigned two officers

72
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,800
護送一位聯邦執法官和一位重要證人
to escort a federal marshal and a high value witness

73
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,740
證人名叫朱莉·馬斯特
named Julie Masters.

74
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,740
聯邦執法官在卡胡庫的安全屋
The federal marshal's been watching her

75
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,440
照看她
in a safe house in Kahuku,

76
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,480
她是謀殺指控的關鍵證人
and she's the key witness in a murder trial

77
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,680
被告是這個人
against this guy,

78
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,340
艾倫·布萊納
Aaron Brenner.

79
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,770
他是巴哈販毒集團的主要經銷人
He's a major distributor for the Baja drug cartel.

80
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,680
沒有朱莉控方就無法立案  
Now, the prosecution cannot make a case without Julie,

81
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,080
沒有證人的話  法官就不得不在今天
and without a witness, the judge is going to be forced

82
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,360
下午五點在布萊納交保后釋放他
to release Brenner on bail at 5:00 p.m. today.

83
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,020
這么說  販毒集團在不惜一切代價地
Okay, so the cartel's going to do everything they can

84
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,500
阻止這個女孩出庭
to keep this girl out of court?

85
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,060
是啊  他們過去十年
Absolutely. They've been trying

86
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,060
一直想把這個惡棍關進大牢
to lock this monster up for ten years.

87
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,360
朱莉的證詞可以使他入獄
And Julie's testimony can do it.

88
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,170
好吧  我們怎么做
All right, where do we come in?

89
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,890
火奴魯魯警局和兩名派去
HPD's lost contact with the two SWAT guys

90
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,090
護送她的特警失去了聯系
they sent in to pick her up.

91
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,400
無線電沒有回音
I mean, there's no comms on the radio.

92
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,600
深入卡胡庫的地區沒有手機信號
There's no cell service that deep in Kahuku.

93
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,460
那位執法官呢
What about the marshal?

94
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,070
他的衛星電話沒有回音
There's no comms on his sat phone.

95
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,610
那我們這是護送任務還是營救任務
Okay, so what are we, an escort or a rescue mission?

96
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,510
現在我們兩樣一起干
Right now we're both. Okay?

97
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,670
我們要找到她
We need to find her,

98
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,070
把她救出來  然后我們要
we need to secure her, and then we need

99
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,740
在下午五點把她送到法庭作證
to transport her to the courthouse 5:00 p.m. to testify.

100
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,880
明白嗎
All right?

101
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,250
就是不接
Bing.

102

This is Detective Danny Williams.

103

I'm not available. Please leave a message.

104
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,210

I need you to pick up Grace at 8:00 instead of 9:00

106

00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,990
阿成  掩護我
Chin, cover me.

141
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,320
我找到一具尸體
I got a body.

142
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,560
我掩護你
I got you.

143
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:30,230
-是誰  -是執法官  死了
- Who is it? - It's the Marshal. He's gone.

144
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,970
科諾  上
Kono. Go.

145
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,010
安全
Clear.

146
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,390
好的  我們要找的是兩個人  塊頭比較大
All right. We're looking for two guys, both big.

147
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,850
11碼鞋  沒有強行闖入的痕跡
Size 11. There's no forced entry,

148
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,850
就是說執法官為他們留了門
which means the Marshal left the door open for them.

149
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,520
他沒想到他們是壞人
He didn't think they were a threat.

150
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,620
是因為他們穿著火奴魯魯警員的制服
It's cause they were wearing HPD uniforms.

151
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,560
查查車子
Check the car.

152
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:06,920
安全
Clear.

153
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:15,040
兩名兇犯的鞋印
Boot prints from the two assailants.

154
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,280
還有朱莉·馬斯特的高跟鞋鞋印
And Julie Masters's heels.

155
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,710
那是什么
What do we got?

156
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,810
看來我們的證人做出了一番抵抗
Looks like our witness was a fighter.

157
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:34,280
-我認為她傷到了其中一位  -干得好
- I think she hurt one of them. - Good for her.

158
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,020
九毫米口徑  三個彈殼
Nine mil. Three casings.

159
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,390
這是她的指紋
This is her print.

160
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,260
這么說她燒傷了槍手
So she burns the shooter

161
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,890
從窗戶跳了出去
and dives through the window.

162
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,240
我希望她還活著  我很想見見她
I really hope she's alive, 'cause I want to meet her.

163
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,500
是啊  看起來她的割傷很嚴重
Yeah. Looks like she cut herself pretty good.

164
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,130
-阿成  -史蒂夫
- Chin. - Hey, Steve.

165
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,200
我在警車這
I'm back by the blue and whites.

166
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,370
你得來看看
You need to see this.

167
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,810
什么情況
What you got?

168
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,120
你殺死了聯邦執法官和兩名警官
You kill a federal marshal and two officers,

169
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,010
唯一的問題是你想怎么死
the only question is how are you going to get put down?

170
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,480
這么說她一個人在外面
So she's out there somewhere, alone.

171
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,390
還被職業殺手追殺
And being hunted by professional assassins.

172
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,020
我們得趕在他們前面找到她
So we have to find her before they do,

173
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,300
還要確保她今天能出庭作證
and make sure she testifies today.

174
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,330
我們從哪找起
Where do we start?

175
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,120
好了  水  即食食物  
All right. Water. MREs.

176
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,730
全球定位儀  衛星電話
GPS. Sat phones. Okay?

177
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,010
在這個地帶  想要找到他們所需的東西
Everything we need to track them in this terrain.

178
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,210
帶著搜查犬的火奴魯魯警警察在路上
HPD is en route with search dogs.

179
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,140
剛剛收到的消息  十分鐘之內
Hey. Just got word that air support's lifting off

180
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,850
空中支援將從火奴魯魯起飛
from Honolulu in ten minutes.

181
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,250
他們在這找不到直升機可以降落的地方
They can't find a place to land a chopper around here.

182
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,220
最近的停機坪離這里有三英里
Nearest LZ is three miles away.

183
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,610
沒關系
That's fine.

184
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,060
在這么茂密的樹林中
In this dense foliage and canopy,

185
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,430
找到她最好的辦法還是跟蹤足跡
our best shot at finding her is tracking, anyway.

186
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,260
-阿成  確認一下這些都是可用的  -好的
- Chin, make sure these are good to go. - Copy that.

187
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,030
-科諾  -說
- Kono? - Yeah?

188
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,430
聯系美國司法部  好嗎
Contact the U.S. Attorney, okay?

189
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,560
找到關于這個被告艾倫·布萊納的一切資料
Find out everything you can about this defendant Aaron Brenner.

190
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,640
然后和毒品管制局核實一下
Then check with the DEA.

191
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,430
我要知道巴哈販毒集團
I want to know who the Baja Cartel

192
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,780
通過誰執行暗殺
contracts its hits through.

193
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,800
我們得知道對手是誰
We need to know what we're up against out there.

194
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,840
好的  沒問題
All right. You got it.

195
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,150
伙計們  過來
Guys, come on in.

196
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,120
我們需要你們封鎖犯罪現場
We need you guys to lock down the crime scene

197
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,210
以防證人或是兇手跑回來  好嗎
in case the witness or the killers double back. Okay?

198
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,350
如果證人回來了
The witness comes back,

199
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,350
直接護送她去法院
you get her straight to the courthouse.

200
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,650
兇手要是回來了
The shooters come back,

201
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,590
干掉他們
you put them down,

202
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,830
確保他們被干掉了
and you make sure they stay down.

203
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,860
格蕾絲
Grace?

204
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,860
爸爸
Daddy!

205
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,080
上來
Come here.

206
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:02,550
我看到他的時候  他已經打開了車門
By the time I saw him, he'd had opened the door.

207
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,820
他們拿著槍
They had guns.

208
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,140
我都聽見了
I heard everything.

209
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,210
你還好嗎
Are you okay?

210
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,330
愛德華茲太太
Mrs. Edwards?

你的提包完好無損

現金和信用卡都在里面

214
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,290
沒有東西被偷走
Nothing seems to be stolen.

215
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,420
我松了一口氣  謝謝
Well, that's a relief. Thank you.

216
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,630
奔馳  你在開斯坦的車嗎
Mercedes? You were driving Stan's car?

217
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,930
是啊  他在泰國談生意
Yeah. He's in Thailand on business.

218
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,560
有時候我們換車開
Sometimes we switch cars.

219
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,270
我跟你談談
Let me talk to you for a second.

220
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,750
我到那邊去和媽媽談話  好嗎
I'm gonna be right there talking to your mom, okay?

221
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,010
你能看見我們
You can see us.

222
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,170
我要你獲取這個家伙的一切信息
I want you to get all this guy's information,

223
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,420
看看他都干了什么  好嗎
see what he's doing, okay?

224
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,340
這邊
Come here.

225
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,080
如果他們把格蕾絲劫走怎么辦
What if they had taken Grace?

226
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,220
他們沒有  你干得很好  保護了她
They didn't. You did a good job and you protected her, okay?

227
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,760
這是怎么回事
What's going on?

228
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,200
好吧
Okay, um...

229
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,720
持槍劫車是要判十年的  知道嗎
armed carjacking is a ten-year sentence.Okay?

230
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,030
蕾切爾  任何打算持槍劫車的人
Rachel, anybody willing to do that,

231
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,970
都甘愿冒這個險
willing to take that risk,

232
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,240
他們不會只是在一個小時后棄車的
they're not gonna just dump the car an hour later.

233
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,440
劫車是為了錢
Okay? You jack a car for money.

234
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,170
你那上萬美元的奔馳車
Your hundred thousand dollar Mercedes,

235
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,950
被海運到中國
it gets put on a boat to China,

236
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,140
某人就能迅速掙到2萬美元
and somebody gets a fast $20,000.

237
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:18,110
他們不會還車  他們不會留下你的錢包
They don't return the car, they don't leave your purse,

238
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,020
他們也不會留下你的現金
they don't leave your cash.

239
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,340
所以為什么
So why?

240
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,780
我是說  如果動機和錢財無關
I mean, there's no profit motive.

241
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,190
為什么有人會這么做
Why would someone do this?

242
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,380
我不知道  你什么意思
Mm, I don't know. What are you saying?

243
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,960
斯坦在家的表現
Anything at all strange

244
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,160
-有什么異常嗎  任何...  -沒有

-你確定  -確定
- You sure? - Yes.

246
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:39,340
好吧  因為我覺得極有可能
Okay, 'cause I think that there's a very high possibility

247
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,910
這是有人在傳遞訊息
that someone is sending a message,

248
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,530
威脅  告訴斯坦說他們能傷害到你
a threat, telling Stan that they can get to you

249
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,610
也能傷害到格蕾絲
and they can get to Grace.

250
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,700
斯坦是我的丈夫  是格蕾絲的繼父
Stan is my husband, he's Grace's stepfather,

251
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,640
他是個正經生意人
and... he is a businessman.

252
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,880
他絕對不會卷入任何非法的事情里去
He's not involved in anything illegal.

253
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,420
我想帶格蕾絲回家
I would like to take Grace home.

254
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,290
我開車送你們
Okay, I'll drive you.

255
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,560
火奴魯魯  聯邦法院

羅伯茨檢察官

It's a short list-- my people and a few high-level DEA agents.

262
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,340
我會讓我辦公室的人馬上給你們發過去
I'll have my office send it over to you right away.

263
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,730
我也需要能夠進入你電腦系統的
Okay, I'm also gonna need full access

無論你要什么  只管開口
I'll get you anything you need.

266
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:27,400
已經有三個人死亡了  你怎么知道朱莉還活著
You've got three dead. How do you know Julie's still alive?

267
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,000
我們不知道  但是她九死一生
We don't, but she got out of the house

268
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,570
沖出了那棟房子  如果她在外面的某處

原定要指控販毒集團的證人的下場
who were scheduled to testify against the cartel.

272
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,690
像朱莉·馬斯特這樣的人
How does someone like Julie Masters

273
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,690
是怎么和巴哈販毒集團扯上關系的
get involved with the Baja Cartel?

274
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,470
她是火奴魯魯一家進口公司的會計
She was an accountant at an import company in Honolulu.

275
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,350
她不知道那家公司
She didn't know it was a front

276
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,620
只是艾倫·布萊納毒品生意的幌子
for Aaron Brenner's drug operation.

277
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,840
某夜  一個碼頭工人正在給一艘貨柜船裝箱
One night a dockworker is loading crates into a container ship,

278
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,900
-發現了他們真正運輸的東西  -海洛因
- discovers what they're really shipping. - Cocaine.

279
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,900
對
Exactly.

280
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,730
艾倫·布萊納冷血地殺害了那個人
Aaron Brenner executed the man in cold blood,

281
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,570
朱莉目擊了這場謀殺
and Julie witnessed the murder.

282
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,700
他試圖殺害她  但她跑了
He tried to kill her; she ran.

283
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,180
從此她就開始了逃亡生涯
She's been running ever since.

284
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,640
如果今天下午5點朱莉到不了法院
If Julie's not in that courtroom by 5:00 p.m. today,

285
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,370
布萊納將會無罪釋放
Brenner's a free man.

286
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,520
你怎么知道他們從這條路走了
How do you know they went this way?

287
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,360
在這樣的地域追蹤他人  關鍵在于一件事
Tracking humans in terrain like this is about one thing--

288
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,790
看看有什么非自然的現象
seeing what's out of context in nature

289
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,760
然后了解其成因
and knowing what caused it.

290
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,490
就好像那塊被扳倒的石板
Like that flat overturned rock back up there.

291
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,360
那需要一個體重200磅的人
It would've taken a 200-pound man

292
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,770
下坡時才會弄倒
running downhill to do that.

293
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,000
那石板也表明了
That rock also indicated

294
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,460
他們是一個小時前到達的那里
they're about an hour ahead of us.

295
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:40,440
真的  一塊石板就能告訴你這么多
Really? The rock told you that?

296
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,880
-看到地上的那葉子了嗎  -看到
- See that leaf on the ground? - Yeah.

297
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,230
還綠著呢
It's still green.

298
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,820
剛剛被折下來的  掩護我
It was just broken off-- cover me.

299
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,240
走向我
Walk towards me.

300
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,840
我不會鳴槍示警
I will not fire a warning shot.

301
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,580
朱莉
Julie.

302
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,450
朱莉  放下武器好嗎
Julie, put down the weapon, okay?

303
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,960
放下武器  走向我
Put down the weapon and walk

304
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,830
我們是警察
towards me-- we're cops.

305
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,030
之前那倆也是
So were the last two.

306
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,260
可能會有一點點疼
This might sting.

307
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,710
絕不能讓艾倫·布萊納逍遙法外
There's no way Aaron Brenner's going to get away with this.

308
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:13,410
你把我帶去法院  我會作證的
You get me to that courtroom, and I'll testify.

309
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:16,000
阿成會帶你過去
Chin will get you there.

310
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:21,110
聽著  除非必要  否則不要用槍  好嗎
Listen, don't use your gun unless you have to, okay?

311
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,580
你絕對不希望引起注意
You don't want to draw attention to yourself.

312
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,580
朱莉  把你的鞋子給我
Julie, let me have your shoes.

313
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,130
脫下來  把鞋子給我
Take 'em off, give me your shoes.

314
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:34,930
阿成  沿著山脊線走  直接去馬凱
Chin... follow the ridgeline, okay, head to Makai.

315
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,370
山脊線會帶你重回大道
It'll lead you back to the road

316
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,790
而那會讓你處于有利位置能夠看清
and it'll give me a better vantage point

317
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,060
-是不是有人追上你們  -收到
- on the guys when they pick up your trail. - Copy.

318
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,830
你為什么不和我們一起走
Why aren't you coming with us?

319
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,380
我要去撂倒那兩個
I'm gonna hunt down the guys

320
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,740
試圖傷害你的人
that have been trying to hurt you.

321
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,840
有些人  生來就不知道害怕
Some guys... they're just born without a fear gene.

322
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,980
艾倫·布萊納
Aaron Brenner.

323
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,860
來給我配偶探監的就是你吧
Oh, you must be my conjugal visit.

324
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,560
你下令謀殺兩名火奴魯魯警官
You ordered the murders of two HPD officers

325
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,790
-和一名聯邦執法官  -你能證明嗎
- and a federal marshal. - And you can prove that?

326
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:14,990
朱莉·馬斯特能  她很快就到
Julie Masters can, and she'll be here soon.

327
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,910
-我搭檔會確保她及時趕到  -離我客戶遠一點
- My partners will make sure of that. - Get away from my client.

328
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,630
我已經等不及想看
I can't wait to see the look in your eyes

329
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,640
當她走進法庭作證時你的表情了
when she walks into that courtroom and testifies.

330
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,300
如果她能作證的話
If she testifies.

331
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,680
警長  帶布萊納先生出去
Sheriffs, take Mr. Brenner out of here

332
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,510
然后讓他在等候區等待
and put him in the holding area now.

333
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,980
我會向法官投訴
I'm lodging a complaint against you

334
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,240
你騷擾我的客戶
for harassment with the judge.

335
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,710
有些人就是拼不對我的名字
You know, some people have trouble with my name,

336
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,950
所以我來幫幫你
so let me help you out.

337
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:37,250
我叫科諾·卡拉克瓦
It's Kono Kalakaua.

338
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:41,490
K-a-l-a-k-a-u-a
K-a-l-a-k-a-u-a.

339
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,840
-我想不是你把門開著沒關吧  -不是
- Don't suppose you left that door open. - No.

340
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,730
911報警電話  你有什么緊急情況要報警
911 operator. What is your emergency?

341
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,140
我是丹尼·威廉姆斯警探
This is Detective Danny Williams.

342
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,170
我的警徽號是7576
My badge number is 7576.

343
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:10,140
請派兩輛警車到庫里奧  薩默街4347號
I need two squad cars to 4347 Summer Street, Kuli'ou'ou--

344
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,380
可能有人正在盜竊
possible burglary in progress.

345
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,000
-收到  他們就在路上  -謝謝
- Roger that. They're on their way. -Thank you.

346
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,050
聽我說  我要你去街上開車兜一兜
Okay, listen to me. Want you to drive around the block.

347
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,260
我確認一切安全了就給你打電話  好嗎
I'll call you when it's safe, okay?

348
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,490
好
Okay.

349
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,450
你
You,

350
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,060
你要和你媽媽去兜兜風
you're gonna go for a little ride with your mom, okay?

351
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,630
我5分鐘就來
I'll be out in five minutes.

352
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,570
你還沒有說完"我愛你  丹諾"我就回來了
I'll be back faster than you can say, "I love you, Danno," okay?

353
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,450
跟車子的情況一樣
Just like the car, it seems

354
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,020
看上去貴重物品都在
like nothing of value was taken.

355
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,260
斯坦的辦公室看上去像被風暴襲擊了一樣
And Stan's office looks like a tornado hit it.

356
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,430
你還是進去  打包些你和格蕾絲的東西
So why don't you go inside, pack a bag for you and Grace?

357
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,860
-什么  這是...  -我希望在搞清楚
- What? Where...? - I want you to go

358
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,200
到底發生了什么之前
to a hotel for a couple of days until I figure out

359
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,460
你們能去酒店住幾天
what is going on here.

360
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,900
斯坦一個小時之內會到家
Stan will be home in an hour

361
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,770
我們會想出應對方法
and we'll figure out what we're going to do.

362
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:55,410
對于我女兒的安全
Okay, Stan does not get to make decisions

363
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,870
斯坦無權做決定
regarding the safety of my daughter,

364
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,920
所以說她可以和你一起去住希爾頓
so she can go to the Hilton with you

365
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,790
或者她可以過來和愛她的
or she can come on what is affectionately known

366
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:03,280
父親一起住
as a ride along with her father.

367
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,380
好嗎
Okay?

368
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,260
我去打包
I'll pack.

369
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,320
但我不想讓她看見房子里面的樣子
But I don't want her to see the house.

370
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,030
她現在已經夠驚恐了  我不希望她更害怕
It will only make her more scared than she already is.

371
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:15,990
蕾切爾
Rachel.

372
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,810
無論那里發生了什么  我告訴你
Whatever is going on here, I am telling you

373
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:25,600
斯坦肯定脫不了干系  好嗎
that Stan is in the middle of it. Okay?

374
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,330
丹尼  格蕾絲和蕾切爾還好嗎
Danny, are Grace and Rachel okay?

375
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,770
她們很安全  但我很不舒服
Yeah, they are safe, but I am sick.

376
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,140
我還余驚未消
I'm in the middle of a panic attack.

377
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,570
這次小意外讓我少活5年
Okay, this little incident just shaved five years off my life.

378
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,520
目擊證人如何了  你找到她了嗎
What's up with the witness? You find her yet?

379
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,240
找到了  但別擔心
Yeah, yeah, but don't worry about that.

380
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,490
你和家人待在一起
Okay, you stay with your family.

381
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:16,910
-別過來了  -好  我不去
- Don't come out here.  - Okay, I'm not.

382
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,070
實際上我正在去往機場的路上
I'm actually on my way to the airport.

383
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,420
你說什么  機場  怎么了  你要去哪
What are you talking about, airport? Why, you going someplace?

384
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,280
斯坦  斯坦回家了
Well, Stan... Stan comes home and, uh,

385
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,860
過去接他回家
go offer him a lift home.

386
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,670
丹尼  你在做什么
Danny, what are you doing?

387
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,170
我什么都沒做
I'm not doing anything.

388
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:36,530
聽著  好嗎
Listen, okay...

389
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:41,210
我也許看不見你  但我能聽見你的聲音
I may not be able to see you, okay, but I can hear you,

390
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,800
-而且你有那么一種語氣  -語氣  我才沒有
- and you have a tone. - Tone. I don't have a tone.

391
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,280
-我沒語氣  -你不是一直說我有個表情嗎
- I don't have a tone. - Okay, you say I have a face?

392
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,910
那你  我的朋友  有種語氣
You, my friend, you have a tone,

393
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:50,210
那種語氣說明"我要狠狠揍一個人"
okay, and it's a tone that says "I'm gonna hit somebody."

394
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,570
現在告訴我  發生什么了
Now, what's going on?

395
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,840
好吧  我覺得斯坦
Okay, I think that Stan--

396
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,210
事實上我知道斯坦和發生在
in fact I know that Stan has something to do

397
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,780
蕾切爾和格蕾絲身上的事有千絲萬縷的聯系
with what happened to Rachel and Grace.

398
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,020
好  除了你痛恨那男人之外
Okay. Is that based in anything

399
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,590
你有沒有其他證據
other than the fact that you hate the man?

400
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,680
是  有證據  好嗎
Yes. It is, okay?

401
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,620
他們偷的是他的車  他們劫的是他的車
They stole his car. They-They got his car.

402
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,150
而不是她的  好嗎
Not hers, okay?

403
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,580
而且他們一小時之內就還了車
And they returned it in an hour,

404
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,790
他們沒帶走任何東西
and they didn't take anything.

405
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:12,590
他們的房子被人強行闖入  翻得亂七八糟
All right, the house was broken into, ransacked,

406
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,460
就和那車一樣  他們什么都沒帶走
and just like the car, they took nothing.

407
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,640
好嗎  你聽著正常嗎
Okay? Does that sound normal to you?

408
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,840
我女兒
All right, my daughter...

409
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,770
我女兒在那房子里睡覺  好嗎
my daughter sleeps in that house, okay?

410
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:22,170
如果斯坦和這件事情有關系
And-and if Stan has anything to do with it,

411
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:25,120
我會"鼓勵"他  交代他知道的一切
I am going to encourage him to tell me what he knows.

412
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,540
好  聽我說好嗎
Okay, listen to me. All right?

413
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,140
我知道你很生氣  我能聽出來
I get that you're pissed, all right? I can hear that.

414
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,580
但是無論你做什么
But whatever you do,

415
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,840
別揍他  好嗎
do not touch him, okay?

416
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,070
別碰他一根汗毛
Do not touch him.

417
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,510
我知道  但是你得理解一下
Yeah, I understand, but you got to understand

418
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,680
我是位父親
that I am a father.

419
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,080
好嗎  而我們現在討論的是我的女兒
All right? And this is my daughter we're talking about.

420
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,130
對  但你還是一名帶槍警察  好嗎
Yeah. You're also a cop with a gun, okay?

421
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,410
當你兩個身份交錯時  事情會變得很混亂  丹尼
And when those worlds cross, it gets messy, Danny.

422
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,960
對  但不是我讓兩個身份交錯的
Yeah, well, I'm not the one who crossed them.

423
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,530
就別擔心我了  我應付得來
Just don't-don't worry about me. Please. I will handle it.

424
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,000
把目擊證人帶去法院  好嗎
Just get your witness to court, okay?

425
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,800
不不  喂喂  丹尼
No. No. Hey, hey. Hey, hey. Danny.

426
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,700
丹尼
Danny?

427
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:01,560
在第一次審判開始的時候我跑回了內陸  
You must think I'm an awful person for running back to

428
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,470
你肯定覺得我是個很糟糕的人
the mainland when the first trial started.

429
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,380
我不知道有關你的任何事
I don't know anything about you.

430
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,310
我不知道你為什么走
I have no idea why you left,

431
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,610
但我相信你一定有自己的原因
but I'm sure you have your reasons.

432
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,350
是因為我的妹妹
It's my sister.

433
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,410
她比我小5歲
She's five years younger than me.

434
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,560
她是我最好的朋友
She's my best friend.

435
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,850
好  這么說你想見你妹妹
All right. So you wanted to see your sister

436
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,750
而且你知道一旦你作證
and you knew if you testified,

437
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,360
他們就會讓你加入證人保護計劃  我明白
they'd put you in witness protection? I get it.

438
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,720
當他們第一次用頻譜為麗莎做出診斷
When they first diagnosed Lisa on the spectrum,

439
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,500
我太小  根本不清楚那意味著什么
I was too young to know what it all meant.

440
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,670
她有自閉癥嗎
She has autism?

441
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,300
一直是我媽媽照顧她
My mom's been taking care of her,

442
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,740
但照顧她變得越來越困難
but it's getting too hard for her.

443
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,570
我來到這里完成學業
I came here to finish school

444
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:37,880
之后我就可以照顧她了
and then I was supposed to take care of her.

445
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,380
那你為什么回來
Why would you come back?

446
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,540
我本以為麗莎不懂這些事
I didn't think Lisa understood any of this.

447
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:46,310
然后有天晚上  很晚了  都過11點了
And then one night, it was late-- it was after 11:00,

448
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,880
通常情況下她9點就上床睡覺了
and she usually goes to bed at 9:00--

449
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,210
她就那么看著我
she just looked at me,

450
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,520
她說我必須得回夏威夷
and she said that I had to go back to Hawaii

451
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,420
確保壞人不會再傷害別人了
and make sure that the bad man didn't hurt anyone else.

452
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,230
你是個勇敢的女人
You're a brave woman.

453
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:03,360
又死了三個人
Three more people are dead,

454
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,520
我可能永遠都見不到我妹妹了
and I may never see my sister.

455
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,720
我必須要回到法庭上去
I have to get back to that courthouse.

456
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,010
好  走
All right, let's go.

457
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,850
好的
Okay.

458
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:00,210
我們走了一半多了
We're more than halfway now.

459
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:02,480
你表現的很棒
You're doing great.

460
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,870
趴下
Get down!

461
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:20,430
堅持住
Hold on.

462
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:22,490
堅持住
Hold on. Okay.

463
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,110
我數到三  拉你上來
I'm going to pull you up on three.

464
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,400
好嗎
Okay?

465
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,640
一  二  三
One, two, three.

466
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,980
繼續往前走
Keep going straight ahead.

467
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,170
我一會兒追上你
I'll be right behind you.

468
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,130
別怕  別怕  是我
It's okay. It's okay. It's me.

469
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:22,130
我把他引向了另一個方向
Now, I've pointed him in another direction,

470
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,440
但是他一會兒就會發現
but he's going to figure it out soon enough.

471
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,480
我們繼續走  好嗎
We've just got to keep moving, okay?

472
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,570
往前走  走吧
Straight ahead. Let's go.

473
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,280
你醒了
You're up.

474
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,760
很好
Good.

475
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:43,020
我要問你幾個問題
I wanted to ask you a couple questions.

476
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,190
你們一共有幾個人被派到夏威夷
How many of you were sent to Hawaii?

477
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:52,660
不是吧  這個時候你讓我問第二遍
Seriously? You going to make me ask you twice right now?

478
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,330
一共三個人
Three of us were sent here.

479
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:58,670
你們從哪飛過來的
Where did you fly in from?

480
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:00,700
圣何塞
San Jose.

481
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,700
哥斯達黎加
Costa Rica.

482
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,640
招供多簡單啊  早說不就完了嗎
See how easy that was?

483
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,370
求你別殺我
Please.

484
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,920
我都招了
I told you what you want to know.

485
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,750
我不會折磨你的  好嗎
I'm not going to torture you, okay?

486
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,240
我要救你
I'm going to save your life.

487
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,840
剛剛的撞擊導致你氣胸
You have a collapsed lung.

488
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,860
我要在你胸腔打個洞
I need to cut a hole in your chest

489
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,030
讓你的肺重新鼓起來
and reinflate your lung,

490
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:25,430
否則你會沒命的  好嗎
or you're going to die. All right?

491
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,760
你最好咬著它
You may want to chew on that.

492
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,600
別出聲
Don't make any noise.

493
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:50,540
科諾
Kono.

494
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,710
有成浩的消息嗎
Did you hear from Chin Ho?

495
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,710
沒有
No.

496
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,300
怎么了  你們倆不是在一起嗎
Why? You don't have eyes on him?

497
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,560
我們分頭行動  他護送證人
No. We split up, but he has the witness.

498
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,720
別擔心  他沒事  你有什么發現
Don't worry, he'll be fine. What do you got?

499
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,510
我還是查不出殺手團伙的身份  你那邊呢
I still have no ID on the hit squad. Any luck on your end?

500
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,220
我制服了一名襲擊者
Yeah. I disabled one of the attackers.

501
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,030
他承認他們一伙是昨天
He confessed to being part of the team

502
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,260
從哥斯達黎加飛來的
that flew in from Costa Rica yesterday.

503
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,840
我馬上檢查哥斯達黎加方向的航班記錄
Okay. I'm checking flight manifests from Costa Rica.

504
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,790
他說有三名暗殺者  知道嗎
He said there were three assassins, okay?

505
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,070
也就是說  我們要找四個人
Which means we're looking for four people--

506
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:14,340
三名槍手和一名清道夫
three shooters and a cleaner.

507
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,570
清道夫  清道夫是什么意思
Cleaner? What's a cleaner?

508
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,940
另一位刺殺者  我的海豹突擊隊
It's another assassin. My SEAL team used

509
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,700
曾經打擊過這種殺手團伙  槍手們
to hunt squads like this. The shooters don't know

510
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,500
對清道夫的身份一無所知
the identity of the cleaner,

511
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:22,700
所以如果他們被俘  還有一位槍手
so if they get captured, there's still another shooter

512
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,940
可以完成任務
in place to pull the trigger.

513
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,780
昨天有一班
All right. There was one flight in

514
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:29,810
從哥斯達黎加到火奴魯魯的飛機
from Costa Rica to Honolulu yesterday.

515
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,240
并且
And...

516
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,930
三名乘客現金付款
three of the passengers paid in cash.

517
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,720
能在監控錄像上找到他們嗎
Okay, can you pull them up on the security cam?

518
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:38,890
找到了
I got them.

519
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,000
知道嗎
You know what?

520
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,190
我沒發現有誰像清道夫
I'm not seeing the fourth guy who could be the cleaner.

521
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:47,070
進行面部識別  檢查所有記錄
Run facial recognition. Go through the records.

522
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:49,260
留意任何能幫我們找到清道夫的線索
Look for any clues that might lead to the cleaner.

523
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,060
同時  讓急救醫療中心派一架救傷直升機
In the meantime, have EMS send a medevac.

524
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:53,610
告訴他們著陸之后步行
Tell them to insert and then proceed on foot

525
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:58,570
到經緯坐標27.97  156.95的位置
to coordinates 27.97 -156.95.

526
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,770
收到
Will do.

527
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:10,300
你好
Hey, there.

528
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,300
愛德華茲

529
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,910
去希爾頓夏威夷度假村713房間  謝謝
Hilton Hawaiian Village, room 713. Thanks.

530
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,150
謝天謝地你和格蕾絲安然無恙
Just thank God you and Grace are okay, baby.

531
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,490
是的
Yeah.

532
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:21,520
聽著  我在路上  馬上就到
All right, listen. I'm on the way. I'll be there soon.

533
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,500
丹尼
Danny?

534
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,200
是我  我來找你談談
Yeah. I got to talk to you.

535
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:36,370
我可沒有征求你的意見  過來  過來
I'm not asking you. Come on. Come on.

536
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,640
我跟你說  斯坦
You know, Stan,

537
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,020
有了女兒之后  我知道有些事
when I had a daughter, I knew that there were certain things

538
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,180
不得不去面對
I was going to have to deal with.

539
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:48,580
收發短信  要給她買很多衣服
Texting. An obscene clothing budget.

540
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,790
不管我選擇什么樣的套餐
A stroke-inducing cell phone bill,

541
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:53,130
花費都很高的手機話費賬單
regardless of the plan that I chose,

542
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,520
但我告訴你
but I'll tell you,

543
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:58,080
有一件事  我可沒想到會發生
there is one thing that did not make the list. Okay.

544
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,030
那就是被人劫車
Carjacking.

545
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:02,560
我從沒想過我那八歲的
Carjacking did not make the list of things that I thought that

546
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,730
寶貝女兒會遭人劫車
I would encounter with my eight-year-old daughter.

547
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:08,190
所以我只問你這一次
So I am going to ask you one time.

548
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:10,830
你惹了什么麻煩
What kind of trouble are you in?

549
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,270
和我沒關系  丹諾
This has nothing to do with me, Danny.

550
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:12,950
我和你一樣震驚
I'm as shocked as you are.

551
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:13,460
住口
Shut up.

552
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:15,420
住口  好嗎
Shut up. Okay?

553
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,450
我想讓你知道
I want you to know something.

554
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,770
要是以前  我會把車停下  把你揍得
Normally, I would just pull over and give you the worst beating

555
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:20,750
你母親都認不出來  直到你說實話
you ever had in your entire life until you told me the truth,

556
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,600
但我正在克制  克制
but I am working, I am working

557
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:24,170
情緒失控問題
on my anger management issues,

558
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:28,050
我正學著如何解決沖突  你懂嗎
and I am learning conflict resolution, you understand?

559
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:29,580
而且我發現了端倪  我發現
And I recognize something. I recognize,

560
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,150
盡管你試圖掩蓋
although you are trying to hide it,

561
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:32,490
你內心卻相當害怕  你也應該害怕
you are very scared right now, as you should be,

562
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:33,750
但證據不足  我姑且
but I am going to give you

563
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,000
相信你說的都是真的  但我要提醒你
the benefit of the doubt and I am going to remind you

564
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,300
正是因為你  有人拿槍接近了我女兒
that because of you, people put guns near my daughter.

565
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:54,740
為了批準我的新地產
I went to the housing commissioner,

566
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,210
我找過房產委員
Bruce Hoffman,

567
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:59,080
布魯斯·霍夫曼
for permits for my new property.

568
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,060
那家伙給我一份"菜單"   
Guy hands me a menu

569
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,390
好像在紐約西普里尼酒店一樣
like we're at Cipriani's in New York.

570
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,750
明碼標價
Everything's got a price.

571
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,010
每次我同意一個數額
Every time I agreed to a number,

572
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:09,190
他都不知足得抬高要價
he jacked it up to a higher one.

573
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,020
所以我把談話錄了下來  說要起訴他
So I taped the conversation, told him I'd have him indicted.

574
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,460
這才是他們要找的  那卷磁帶
So that's what they're looking for. The tapes?

575
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,570
丹尼  對天發誓  我永遠不會
Danny, I swear to God, I never...

576
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,600
為什么不直接找我
Why didn't you just come to me?

577
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,040
-你在說笑嗎  -沒有
- Are you kidding? - No, I'm not.

578
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,040
聽著
Look,

579
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,210
我和蕾切爾最近關系有點僵
things haven't been great with Rachel and me lately.

580
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:37,120
但我愛她  丹尼  也愛格蕾絲
But I love her, Danny, and I love Grace.

581
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,120
這項交易會使我們從中受益
This deal could make a lot of things right for us.

582
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,020
好吧  聽著
Okay. Uh, listen.

583
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,650
格蕾絲和蕾切爾會住在希爾頓酒店...
Grace and Rachel are going to be staying at the Hilton...

584
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,560
你真的認為...
You really think...

585
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,960
他們劫了你的車
Hey. They jacked your car.

586
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,730
闖入了你的房子
They broke into your house.

587
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:49,640
那是我女兒  
That is my daughter.

588
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,860
是的  斯坦  我就是這么認為
So, yes, Stan, I think.

589
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,260
給你  不用找了
Here you go. Keep the rest.

590
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,000
非常感謝
Thanks a lot.

591
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,370
你是不是房產委員
Aren't you the housing commissioner, right?

592
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:06,510
我是布魯斯·霍夫曼
Bruce Hoffman.

593
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:16,150
你們都出去  來
I need this room. Come on.

594
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:16,940
快快快  出去
Come on, come on. Come on, come on.

595
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,480
走  出去
Go ahead. Come on, out, out.

596
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,470
我是丹尼·威廉姆斯警探
I'm Detective Danny Williams.

597
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:31,060
你為了警告斯坦·愛德華茲
I am also the father of that little girl

598
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,510
今天早上劫持了一輛奔馳
that was in the Mercedes that you had carjacked this morning,

599
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,780
我的女兒就坐在上面
sending a message to Stan Edwards.

600
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,470
磁帶現在在我這  不在他手上
I have the tapes now. He doesn't have them anymore.

601
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:40,370
我來問問你
I'm going to ask you a question.

602
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:45,240
如果磁帶曝光了會發生什么
What do you think would happen if those tapes got out? Huh?

603
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,680
聽著  我不知道
Look, look. I... I don't know anything

604
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,880
你在說什么
about what you're talking about,

605
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,510
威廉姆斯...
Detective...

606
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,180
威廉姆斯
Williams.

607
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:58,930
威廉姆斯
Williams.

608
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,540
你可以把我的警號從額頭上抄下來
You can get my badge number off your forehead.

609
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:07,990
磁帶在我手上  我會揭發你
I have those tapes, and will expose you,

610
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:11,500
如果你再敢
and if you ever, ever

611
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,670
讓人拿槍接近我女兒
put a gun in the same zip code as my daughter,

612
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:16,200
對天發誓  我會殺了你的
I swear to God, I will kill you.

613
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,110
懂了嗎
You understand?

614
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:20,010
-懂了  -是嗎
- Yeah. - Yeah?

615
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:22,110
-是的  -很好
- Yes. - Good.

616
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,830
跟緊點
Stay close.

617
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,940
好的
Okay.

618
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:31,540
該死
Damn it.

619
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,040
稍等
Hold on.

620
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:55,560
你不能打電話叫一架直升機嗎
Can't you just call for a helicopter?

621
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,140
我也想啊  但我的手機和槍一起掉下懸崖了
I would. But my phone went down the cliff with my gun.

622
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,040
-只剩一小時了  -騎摩托能趕上
- We've only got an hour left. - This bike'll get us there.

623
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:18,320
-他是以前的那伙人嗎  -不是
- Is he one of them? - No.

624
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,260
蹲下
Stay down.

625
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:28,260
阿成  是他
Chin, it's him.

626
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,990
另一個家伙
It's the other guy.

627
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,030
他繞過來了
He's coming around.

628
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:33,330
別動  別動
Don't move. Don't move.

629
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,470
蹲下
Get down.

630
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,520
上車
Get on the bike!

631
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:10,580
進去
Get in.

632
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,950
我是海軍少校史蒂夫·麥格瑞特
This is Lieutenant Commander Steve McGarrett.

633
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:28,770
證人朱莉·馬斯特受到保護
The witness, Julie Masters, is secure,

634
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,300
我們正要把她帶來
and we're bringing her in.

635
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,440
我要求法院周圍部署武裝守衛
All right, I want an armed perimeter guarding the courthouse.

636
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,770
還有一位潛在暗殺者
There's still a potential assassin

637
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:37,070
沒有被逮捕
who has not been apprehended.

638
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,370
我們乘卡車前往目的地
We're coming in by truck.

639
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:42,340
相信我  很容易認出我們的卡車
You'll know which truck, trust me.

640
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,400
我車里有備用的鞋和衣服
Uh, I have an extra pair of shoes and a sweater in my car.

641
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,500
我們得走了
We got to go.

642
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:13,340
謝謝你
Thank you.

643
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,990
為我做的一切
For everything.

644
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:20,970
不必再逃亡了
No more running.

645
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,100
去吧
Go.

646
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:21,220
看來證人最后還是現身了
I see that you've finally produced your witness.

647
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,120
她隨時可以作證
She's ready to testify.

648
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,050
我的委托人想跟你們庭外和解
My client would like to talk about a deal.

649
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,750
他認罪并供出毒品供應商的名字
He pleads guilty and gives up the names

650
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:29,120
和殺害兩名警察和一名聯邦執法官
of his suppliers and his coconspirators

651
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,480
的同謀名單
in the murders of the two cops and the federal marshal

652
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:35,420
作為交換  他免于死刑  改判終身監禁
in exchange for life in prison with no death penalty.

653
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,700
他會死在監獄  而不是被處死
He dies in prison instead of being executed,

654
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,430
作為交換
and in exchange,

655
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:51,070
我們還能多捉住十個艾倫·布萊納這樣的壞人  朱莉
we get to put ten more Aaron Brenners away for life, Julie.

656
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:01,680
你的合作律師呢  協議上他也必須簽名
Where's your co-counsel? He has to sign off on this.

657
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,780
他在會議室等著呢
He's waiting in the conference room.

658
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,060
科諾
Hey, Kono.

659
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,360
清道夫是布萊納的合作律師
Hey, the cleaner is Brenner's co-counsel.

660
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,830
金發  一米七
She's a blonde woman, five, seven,

661
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:11,390
她現在就在法院里
and she's in the courthouse right now.

662
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:26,970
他在哪
Where is he?

663
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,200
馬上就來
He'll be right in.

664
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:05,010
雖然還有很多事情我可以教你
You know, there might be a few other things I could teach you,

665
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:07,450
但是痛扁對手這項  你已經很嫻熟了
but I think you've got the whole ass-kicking thing down.

666
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:27,090
一切都好嗎
Is everything all right?

667
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:30,470
現在好了  多虧丹尼
Yeah, it is now, thanks to Danny.

668
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,930
是的  只是一場  誤會
Yeah, it was just a... misunderstanding.

669
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:38,570
斯坦不過是被卷入其中
Stan just got caught in the middle of it.

670
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:41,580
錯不在他  現在都解決了
You know, it wasn't his fault. It's over now.

671
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,380
再次感謝  丹尼
Thanks again, Danny. All right.

672
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,900
你
You.

673
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:50,680
-過兩天再見  好嗎  -好  我愛你  丹諾
- I'll see you later, okay? - Okay. I love you, Danno.

674
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,510
我也愛你
I love you, too.

675
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,890
走吧  孩子
