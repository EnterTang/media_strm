1
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,750
短假期是个疯狂的念头
The mini break is a colossal cauldron of crazy,

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,130
把人急得像热锅上的蚂蚁
within which boils a bewildering broth of baffle.

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,330
你不知道能否有条不紊地
How the cust can you be certain your condensed campaign

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,460
完成紧张的旅行和购物计划
and consumption is proceeding correctly?

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,800
别担心 因为乱炖魔王 理查德·阿尤阿德
Fear not for I the heinous hodge podge called Richard Ayoade,

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,930
会帮你把慌乱的旅行变得紧凑有序
am here to get your short hall game tight!

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:23,350
我将和制作组请得起的那些名人一起
I, joined by some of the most available and affordable names in light ent,

8
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,800
带你领略最多姿多彩的短假期
am going to rollick you round a maxi-packed mini-break.

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,140
这是场简单粗暴的旅行
This is travel without mercy.

10
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,680
今晚开始的四十八小时旅行
Tonight 48 hours in the city

11
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,400
来到了至少要两天建成的城市
which took at least two days to build;

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,870
罗马
I’m talking R to the ome.

13
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,940
每年有超过两千万的游客涌进这里
Over 20 mill tourists per annum swamp the eternal city

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,780
领略这里无与伦比的历史文化
to enjoy a peerless phalanx of the ancient.

15
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,816
干杯
Cheers

16
00:00:45,816 --> 00:00:50,330
本期我们请来了演员兼编剧 喜剧明星
And, in this ep, the dolce to my vita is played by male actor,

17
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,240
马特·卢卡斯和我一起享受美好时光
writer, and comedian, Matt Lucas.

18
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,090
我觉着 我的智商至少比熊高
I could outwit a racoon- I reckon.

19
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,230
我们将一起
Together we will-

20
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,840
像巨人一样战斗
Clash like titans:

21
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,890
我们仿佛坐时光机来到了古罗马
It’s like stepping out the tardis into actual ancient Rome.

22
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,360
像凤头鸟一样吃东西
Chew like cardinals-

23
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,470
你喜欢微芯片吗
You like micro chips.

24
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,250
不然我是怎么成名的
What do you think built this temple?

25
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,060
像公爵一样开车
And drive like dukes-

26
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,770
我在罗马看的最多的就是我发白的指节
The thing that I see most in Rome, are my own whitening knuckles.

27
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,780
我们来啦 但是这趟值吗
We’re here! But should we have come?

28
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,380
值得
Yes.

29
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,340
你好像慢了半拍吧
Is that the delay I’m going to be dealing with?

30
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:21,980
值得
Yes.

32
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:34,170
假如想要省钱 游客来罗马玩两天只需一人花185英镑
Frugal forward planners could snatch 48 hours in Rome for £185pp.

33
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,350
但这趟出租车
 This cab trip has played a key part in already

34
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,650
足以破坏整个省钱计划
making that target a massive impossibility.

35
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,210
您真绅士
You are a gentleman.

36
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,250
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

37
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,940
他好像对小费很不满意
He looked at that like it was half of what he expected.

38
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,450
这温度你受得了吗
How are you with the heat?

39
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,880
不太行 你呢
Not great, you?

40
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,620
我显然也受不住
I’m you know, terrible, obviously.

41
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,700
好了 这下我们意见统一了
Great we’re in the right place then.

42
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,670
当然
Course we are.

43
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,950
说到这 我们为什么要来罗马
Actually come to think of it, why have we come to Rome?

44
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,820
让我告诉你
I’ll tell you why:

45
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,810
罗马帝国由著名的弑兄者罗慕路斯于公元前753年建立
Founded by noted brother slayer, Romulus, in 753BC,

46
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,040
在公元476年之前 罗马一直是罗马帝国的首都 
Rome was the HQ of the Roman Empire until 476AD.

47
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,210
如果你喜欢历史的话 那你真是来对地方了
If you like old shizz you’ve hit the melon farming mother load.

48
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,090
著名的罗马人有 军事扩张者尤利乌斯·凯撒
Famous Romans include serial expansionist Julius Caesar,

49
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,385
荧屏女神索菲亚·罗兰  还有我心中的大师费德里科·费里尼
screen siren Sofia Loren and my personal maestro, Federico Fellini.

50
00:02:20,385 --> 00:02:23,540
罗马的许多设计都对球形情有独钟
Many Roman inventions have enjoyed a near globular grip:

51
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,730
无论是水泥 拱门
I’m talking concrete, I’m talking the arch,

52
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,220
渡槽 下水道或是书籍
I’m talking the aqueduct, I’m talking sewers, I’m talking books

53
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,200
甚至是公共厕所的基石 都是如此
and I’m talking the bed rock of any civilised society- public toilets y’all.

54
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,250
今晚我们将入住G罗浮旅馆
This eve we will kip down at the G Rough,

55
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:44,330
一个只有十个房间的精品酒店 由十六世纪的住宅改造而成
a 10 room boutique hotel hewn from a 16th century townhouse.

56
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,350
-你好啊  -我叫马蒂奥
- Hello guys how are you doing? - My name is Mateo.

57
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,440
欢迎来到G罗浮旅馆
Welcome to G-Rough.

58
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,080
要我帮您拿行李吗
So do you mind if I look after your luggage?

59
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,270
好的 请
Please go, go.

60
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,290
只是为了称下衣服有多重
The scales are just to weigh my clothes.

61
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,910
每间房间都致敬了一位意大利设计师
Each room is homage to an Italian designer 

62
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,050
每位设计师的名字都被写在了酒店里
with whom the hotel is on figurative first name terms.

63
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,130
他为什么要吸一颗蛋
Why is he trying to smoke an egg?

64
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,220
“罗浮”指的是这里粗糙的墙壁 好在华丽的饰品
The ‘rough’ refs the bare plaster walls which are offset by blingy biz

65
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,264
和高档家具帮它美化了不少
and furniture that probably isn’t self-assemble.

66
00:03:10,264 --> 00:03:13,100
完工后一定更棒
Yeah it’ll be even better when it’s finished.

67
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,980
顺着楼梯上去就是露台了
This cripplingly chic combo is topped off with a roof terrace

68
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,500
矮得连烟屁股都会露出来
that isn’t even covered in fag butts!

69
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:21,923
你干什么呢
What are you doing?

70
00:03:21,923 --> 00:03:23,420
看风景
I was looking at a Vista.

71
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,380
没时间给你看风景
There’s no time for Vistas.

72
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,500
我们行程很紧
We’ve got a schedule!

73
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,890
我知道 但这里好舒服 还有靠垫
I know but it’s nice, comfy there’s cushions.

74
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:32,220
你看着就像在后台区休息
You look like you’re at some kind of backstage area at Latitude.

75
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:32,830
走吧
Come on.

76
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,844
好吧
Alright.

77
00:03:33,844 --> 00:03:36,400
我刚刚看见乔·怀丽和北极猴子的团员在那儿
I’ve just seen Jo Whiley down there with one of the Arctic Monkeys.

78
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,390
你当然能看到
Course you have.

79
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,330
我要怎么下去 没有台阶啊
How am I gonna get down? Have you seen the step?!

80
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,010
在开启紧张的旅程前
Before we can begin to fling ourselves into the fray

81
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,350
咱们得赶紧买些东西
we need to make a pressing purchase.

82
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:50,240
我担心我的头会被晒伤
I’m worried about getting sunburn on my head.

83
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:54,410
好在罗马最古老的帽子店就在这儿
Yeah, luckily Rome’s oldest hat shop is here.

84
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,870
字幕
The cats at Antica Maniffattura Capelli

85
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,360
字幕
have been brutally pummelling high quality headgear for 80 years.

86
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,720
字幕
 This is the classic Fedora hat.

87
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,980
字幕
Wow this is lovely.

88
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,340
字幕
This is a man who owns his own winery.

89
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,150
字幕
Cappelli’s is crammed with a shiz ton of wooden formers

90
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,250
字幕
meaning a dude can get his dome piece made to measure.

91
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,050
字幕
Would it be possible to change the ribbon, the band?

92
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:19,870
字幕
Thank you very much.

93
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,350
字幕
-Are you matching it to the tie?  -Yeah.

94
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,210
字幕
Nice.

95
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,240
字幕
Think I prefer the original ribbon- no I don’t its fine.

96
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,700
字幕
Like some kind of post-colonial Kojak reboot

97
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,410
字幕
we saunter through Rome and commence pointing at POIs  

98
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,620
字幕
Where are we going?

99
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,560
字幕
We’re going on a Fiat tour.

100
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,090
字幕
Really?

101
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,500
字幕
Well in a Fiat we’re not just touring a variety of Fiats.

102
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,700
字幕
The original Fiat 500 is to Italy what the mini is to Britain;

103
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,930
字幕
an impractically small nostalgic car.

104
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,460
字幕
Quite noisy isn’t it?

105
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:57,920
字幕
Welcome to Rome, welcome on board the Fiat 500 cars!

106
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,530
字幕
Guide Alvise walkie-talkies us through the antiquities

107
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,790
字幕
while we focus on being facetious.

108
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,720
字幕
There are very relaxed driving conditions in Rome.

109
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,320
字幕
With an even longer look at the Colosseum earmarked

110
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,250
字幕
for the part that calls itself 2 

111
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,960
字幕
we trundle towards former chariot racing venue the Circus Maximus.

112
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,840
字幕
Stadium for the chariot races, Ben- Hur to your right.

113
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,810
字幕
Oh Ben-Hur.

114
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,390
字幕
You need to back off the espressos.

115
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,800
字幕
And on the far side of the circus we managed

116
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,900
字幕
to record this terrific shot of the Palatine hill.

117
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,650
字幕
So to the right you can see Caesars Palace.

118
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,140
字幕
I’ve actually been to Caesars Palace,

119
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,260
字幕
I saw Elton John there do the million dollar piano

120
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,900
字幕
and I’m hoping to go back and see Celine Dion.

121
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,370
字幕
Well that will be lovely.

122
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,610
字幕
It would be nice

123
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:52,280
字幕
Then we rev on to the southernmost of Rome’s septet of summits:

124
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,010
字幕
the Avantine hill.

125
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:57,140
字幕
 At its apex stands a priory belonging to The Knights of Malta

126
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,190
字幕
which has sovereign status, like an embassy!

127
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:05,130
字幕
Yes so welcome here, it is the only keyhole, in the world,

128
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,070
字幕
which you are allowed to peep through.

129
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:11,870
字幕
And through the keyhole you will see three countries in line,

130
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:16,820
字幕
here in Italy, the Island Malta and then we will have the Vatican.

131
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,830
字幕
It is very well framed.

132
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,220
字幕
With midday refusing to relent,

133
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,610
字幕
the ambient temp is pretty flipping far from mild.

134
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,680
字幕
I’ve lost use out of this eye.

135
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,470
字幕
All the sun creams gone in there.

136
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,060
字幕
I’m really weeping out of this,

137
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,210
字幕
it’s not because I find the conversation upsetting.

138
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:36,430
字幕
Oh you really are! I’ll give you a tissue.

139
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,690
字幕
It’s fine you don’t need both eyes to drive.

140
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,380
字幕
How do you think Nelson drove.

141
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,140
字幕
Thank you very much, I’ll just stick that in there.

142
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,650
字幕
That’s reassuring.

143
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,730
字幕
In another country.

144
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,580
字幕
On the other side of the road.

145
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,490
字幕
Hashtag Romebantz .

146
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,760
字幕
Our subsequent stop off serves

147
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,180
字幕
as a literalised metaphor of this show’s obsession with time.

148
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,580
字幕
So this is a tradition when the Pope was king

149
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,630
字幕
and he was annoyed with 900 churches,

150
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,520
字幕
900 bells ringing at different times at noon.

151
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,300
字幕
So he said hold the phone,

152
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,360
字幕
wait for my signal then you can ring the bells.

153
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,520
字幕
I would have loved it if he had said ‘hold the phone’ in 1850.

154
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,530
字幕
The Pope’s chosen signal was the soothing sound of cannon fire.

155
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,860
字幕
We’ve got the talking clock in England;

156
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,660
字幕
you can call up anytime you want.

157
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:34,190
字幕
And they’ve been blasting away every day for the last century and a half.

158
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,940
字幕
I’m going in.

159
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,350
字幕
That was loud, that was loud.

160
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,390
字幕
But that pumped up pistol

161
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:49,050
字幕
has provided a welcome punctuation point to our period of touring.

162
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,988
字幕
Well thank you for this tour, it’s been a pleasure.

163
00:07:51,988 --> 00:07:55,730
字幕
I once saw a documentary on Rome and it reminds me of that.

164
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:59,010
字幕
It’s good to bring that memory so vividly to life.

165
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,210
字幕
We now opt to cop a closer scope at

166
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,590
字幕
perhaps the most Catholic city within a city on earth,

167
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,020
字幕
I’m talking the Vat to the I to the Can.

168
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,500
字幕
0.44 square kilometres,

169
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,800
字幕
smallest internationally recognised state in the world

170
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,940
字幕
, the Vatican! Nine miles of museums,

171
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,460
字幕
we’ve not got time for that.

172
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,090
字幕
So we’re not even going to go in.

173
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:21,840
字幕
What?!

174
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,290
字幕
Look at the queue! It’s ridiculous we can’t go in there.

175
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,910
字幕
Take it in then move on.

176
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,840
字幕
I would say if I had a dream,

177
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,010
字幕
it would be to stand outside the Vatican,

178
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,290
字幕
holding hands with one of my favourite comedians.

179
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:42,730
字幕
Just spontaneously, romantically holding-

180
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,320
字幕
Well I don’t think we can get Jim Davidson out here on such short notice.

181
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,250
字幕
Right.

182
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,330
字幕
Shall we?

183
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,300
字幕
Yeah.

184
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,250
字幕
Alright.

185
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:59,650
字幕
But to make sure we fully get our Pope on, we hit up a kiosk.

186
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,493
字幕
Hi, I don’t even know how to say this:

187
00:09:02,493 --> 00:09:05,040
字幕
Do you have the Pope magazine?

188
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:12,030
字幕
Ahh oh fabulous ‘Il Mio Papa’

189
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:15,530
字幕
Pope Francis, he’s actually one of my favourite Popes.

190
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,810
字幕
Who’s your top five?

191
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:23,980
字幕
Okay, so err Pope Benedict, Pope John Paul, Pope John Paul II,

192
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,430
字幕
Pope Francis and I don’t know any other Popes.

193
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,420
字幕
Where are you going?

194
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,590
字幕
Oh do we just stand here?

195
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,920
字幕
Yes ideally.

196
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,790
字幕
Look at this- there’s the Pope whacking a kid.

197
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,900
字幕
Not very nice is it? How often does this come out do you know?

198
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,740
字幕
Every week.

199
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,780
字幕
Are you serious?!

200
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:42,797
字幕
Yeah, that’s him protecting himself against a female assailant.

201
00:09:42,797 --> 00:09:43,980
字幕
Do you want this for your files?

202
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,540
字幕
No.

203
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,310
字幕
Okay.

204
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,580
字幕
As the sun sinks beneath the Tiber

205
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:54,010
字幕
we seek to explore the Italian soul via a colossal carve up.

206
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,820
字幕
You know this is a Michelin starred joint.

207
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,843
字幕
Is it? It’s wasted on me.

208
00:09:59,843 --> 00:10:01,740
字幕
I have the eating age of a nine year old.

209
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,170
字幕
You mainly like plain crisps.

210
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,930
字幕
And fizzy pop.

211
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:08,960
字幕
Chef Riccard Di Giancinto’s five course menu

212
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,730
字幕
is a radical reimagining of the Italian classics,

213
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:17,090
字幕
and business opens with an amuse bouche of my old enemy - savoury macarons.

214
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,450
字幕
Would you ever cook like this at home?

215
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,230
字幕
Yeah frequently. No.

216
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,010
字幕
And the starters don’t stop.

217
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:28,530
字幕
See this Maritozzi bun and liquidised Carbonara for details.

218
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,060
字幕
No?

219
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,350
字幕
Don’t tell anyone but it’s very greasy.

220
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,400
字幕
As the courses continue,

221
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,440
字幕
we must now contend with the sheer scale of our tableware.

222
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,250
字幕
Richard you know what they say: When in Rome…

223
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,687
字幕
You managed to get that in finally.

224
00:10:47,687 --> 00:10:48,330
字幕
Thank you.

225
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,380
字幕
Took a while.

226
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,710
字幕
It takes so long to reach- I was tipping it for about 2 hours!

227
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,200
字幕
I had to stop and take another breath.

228
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,520
字幕
It’s amazing!

229
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,390
字幕
I can’t get at it.

230
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,560
字幕
Eating with elegance, we plough through pasta…

231
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,220
字幕
Bosh. Lovely. What’s next?

232
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,010
字幕
On our way to the closer; a Roman oxtail

233
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:14,960
字幕
in the shape of one of Gulliver’s Personal Stash of Ferrero Rochers…

234
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,730
字幕
If I was a food critic-

235
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,290
字幕
yes.

236
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,660
字幕
Which in a sense you are.

237
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,190
字幕
-I would say it tastes nice.

238
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:30,190
字幕
Matt’s desert is a fruit and veg fusion of Celery strawberries and almonds 

239
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,820
字幕
while I crunch down a quasi-conventional tiramisu.

240
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,840
字幕
I’ve wolfed that.

241
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,090
字幕
I have no class.

242
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,480
字幕
And I’ve very much enjoyed it.

243
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,550
字幕
Would you like to try some of this?

244
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,560
字幕
Of course I would.

245
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,420
字幕
This culinary crush ends with petit fours-

246
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,570
字幕
My Lord and Saviour what on earth is going on?

247
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:48,050
字幕
Lads, lads, lads, there’s so much food here.

248
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,540
字幕
I shall end up over weight.

249
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,420
字幕
… and a cup of joe.

250
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,080
字幕
If I were to rate this on Time Out best eats, 

251
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,680
字幕
it’s a hard 5.

252
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,480
字幕
Out of what?

253
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:57,860
字幕
5.

254
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,640
字幕
Oh right.

255
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,083
字幕
How do you feel this went?

256
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,780
字幕
I think it was delicious.

257
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,070
字幕
I need to be asleep.

258
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:10,540
字幕
I need this coffee so I can get to the bed to fall asleep.

259
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,800
字幕
Now I’m awake.

260
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,490
字幕
So I might need some of this.

261
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,320
字幕
Still in the fist of our excess,

262
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,560
字幕
we stagger serenely t’wards our pre-day two doss down,

263
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,850
字幕
after which we’ll: Lob coins-

264
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,190
字幕
Bang.

265
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,310
字幕
Touch sticks-

266
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,500
字幕
That could have hurt!

267
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,480
字幕
 And walk next to a person! 

268
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,440
字幕
Friends, you re-join Matt Lucas and I,

269
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,890
字幕
the proprietor of this nasal lisp,

270
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:44,660
字幕
for the second segment of this ground-breaking minibreak in relic ridden Rome.

271
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,360
字幕
On Day 1 you may have already forgotten how: We revved…

272
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,290
字幕
Alright!

273
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,900
字幕
Recoiled…

274
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:53,700
字幕
That was loud.

275
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,450
字幕
And remained in character-

276
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,670
字幕
Bosh. Lovely. What’s next?

277
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:02,750
字幕
Day 2 starts crowd-beatingly early at one of Rome’s most notable nooks.

278
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,780
字幕
Yes! You do recognise it from the Lizzie McGuire movie.

279
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,570
字幕
It’s the same fountain, the Trevi fountain.

280
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,320
字幕
Oh right! Who’s Trevor?

281
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,130
字幕
It’s named after Trevor MacDonald.

282
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,190
字幕
Oh right.

283
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,280
字幕
Dispiritingly, we’re so early that

284
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,170
字幕
we hit the non-photogenic fountain cleaning slot,

285
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,700
字幕
but will it stop us from enacting an ancient coin toss? Let’s find out!

286
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,320
字幕
There’s a very strict tradition.

287
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,265
字幕
You have to throw with you your right hand over your left shoulder.

288
00:13:34,265 --> 00:13:37,980
字幕
Legend has it that Roman Legionaries would throw three coins this way.

289
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,800
字幕
Bang.

290
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,190
字幕
I wished for a champions league place for Arsenal.

291
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,630
字幕
What does that mean exactly?

292
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,690
字幕
Dunno.

293
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,450
字幕
This ritual was supposed to ensure safe return to Rome

294
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,140
字幕
from far flung parts of the empire.

295
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,630
字幕
Save some for the wide shot.

296
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:56,790
字幕
Okay, ready? 3,2,1, no.

297
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:02,800
字幕
4,3,2,-3, 2, 1, but we’ll  do it on zero.

298
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,360
字幕
3,2,1, zero.

299
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,840
字幕
At 255 years old the Trevi fountain is the closest

300
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,700
字幕
that Rome comes to a new build.

301
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,420
字幕
  Especially compared to this crate.

302
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,670
字幕
The Colosseum was built to provide free entertainment

303
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,520
字幕
and to re-enforce the might of Rome:

304
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,310
字幕
the same reason why I built my side-return.

305
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,800
字幕
Either she’s going through a legal document or she’s our tour guide.

306
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,720
字幕
Hi!

307
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,090
字幕
Hello

308
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,190
字幕
Nice to meet you, I’m Laura.

309
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,110
字幕
Tempus fugit, so let’s jointly take note of the top spec architecture,

310
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,440
字幕
pioneering use of concrete and multiple gates allowing easy access to approx.

311
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,410
字幕
65,000 bods before we glide inside…

312
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,850
字幕
We are entering the Colosseum from actually the loser gate.

313
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:49,580
字幕
The loser gate,

314
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,290
字幕
Exactly

315
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,200
字幕
Thank you.

316
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:58,430
字幕
Despite being well old, this heap still stands up to scrutiny.

317
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,000
字幕
Beneath the floor a network of lifts 

318
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,180
字幕
provided access to the frankly sandy stage.

319
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,560
字幕
So we have in the morning hunting games until 12 o’clock.

320
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,440
字幕
And they stopped to do public execution here.

321
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,970
字幕
And then arrived the Gladiator in the evening.

322
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,720
字幕
It’s a bit grim isn’t it?

323
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,650
字幕
-You’re not pro the execution of hundreds of thousands of people.  -I’m not.

324
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:23,730
字幕
I’m actually not.

325
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,300
字幕
Well you need to start making that clear on your twitter feed.

326
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,920
字幕
On the plus side entry was gratis and there was complimentary nosebag.

327
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,950
字幕
They had free snacks;

328
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:33,710
字幕
Free snacks

329
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,730
字幕
Yeah, The Emperor would provide all this.

330
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:39,940
字幕
You see the illusion of generosity, but in reality, he was a (explicit)

331
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,930
字幕
Exactly!

332
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,160
字幕
Hey he provided chicken wings.

333
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,170
字幕
What have you ever done?

334
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:47,270
字幕
I have provided food for thirty or forty in my house;

335
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,360
字幕
I did not make them fight to the death.

336
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:54,010
字幕
With that that bare-faced lie still ringing round the arena,

337
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:57,690
字幕
we bid Laura bye and, perforce, bust.

338
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,090
字幕
Uncle Richard?

339
00:15:59,090 --> 00:15:59,680
字幕
That’s right.

340
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,730
字幕
Where are we going?

341
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:03,710
字幕
I’ll tell you where we’re going, we’re going to overtake them,

342
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:08,180
字幕
then we are going to Tazza D’oro, cup of gold, for a granita de café.

343
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,450
字幕
Sugary expresso is frozen to a melting sorbet consistency

344
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:16,340
字幕
and topped off with whipped cream to create a caffeinated sundae.

345
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,520
字幕
Cheers.

346
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,310
字幕
There we go.

347
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,830
字幕
That’s what the Vikings would do.

348
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:24,520
字幕
And, near the end of my outstretched digit lies the set up to the following pun.

349
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,650
字幕
That’s very much in the pantheon of things

350
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,040
字幕
that you should look at whilst you’re here.

351
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,970
字幕
That’s correct.

352
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:31,380
字幕
Oh that’s quite strong.

353
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,540
字幕
I don’t usually have coffee so I might be bouncing off the walls.

354
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,690
字幕
Are you pleased you’ve seen the Pantheon from the outside?

355
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,750
字幕
Not bothered.

356
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,200
字幕
You’re unbelievable.

357
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,890
字幕
Don’t steal my angle.

358
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,000
字幕
Come on.

359
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,750
字幕
Overwhelmed by the pulchritude, we lope off to get physical-

360
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,570
字幕
That’s too short.

361
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,450
字幕
Oh I was gonna say erotic.

362
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,410
字幕
Okay.

363
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:00,400
字幕
Since 1999 this school has offered historically

364
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,260
字幕
accurate lessons in Gladiatorial combat.

365
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:03,680
字幕
Hi.

366
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,480
字幕
Hi, welcome to Gladiator School.

367
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,820
字幕
Today you will be training with my Medusa, the head of the Gladiators.

368
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,670
字幕
He’s the spitting image of my accountant.

369
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,100
字幕
Really?

370
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:18,920
字幕
And at the end of the training you will fight him with one of these.

371
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,780
字幕
Fight him?! Wow that’s heavy.

372
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,690
字幕
Ok, he has no idea of the fury inside me

373
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,250
字幕
that I’m going to unleash on him.

374
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,190
字幕
Perfect.

375
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:32,490
字幕
In this thrilling montage we show our progress through a series of warm ups

376
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:36,440
字幕
in which we display our agility and courage.

377
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,450
字幕
Did they have deodorant in Ancient Rome?

378
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:38,920
字幕
No.

379
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:43,060
字幕
Cause this would have stank! Imagine they did all of this pre Lynx!

380
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,980
字幕
Gladiators used short swords and, equipped with wooden facsimiles,

381
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,400
字幕
we learnt the moves to repel strikes to the head-

382
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,460
字幕
Head!

383
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,320
字幕
the neck-

384
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,150
字幕
Necks!

385
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:54,930
字幕
– still the neck–

386
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:55,820
字幕
Other side!

387
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,220
字幕
Haha, Frank Butcher!

388
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,000
字幕
legs-

389
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,040
字幕
Legs!

390
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,080
字幕
and the tum tum.

391
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,300
字幕
Stomach!

392
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:07,910
字幕
Finally, in a newly scored sub-arena of the arena, the combat intensifies.

393
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:08,910
字幕
Off you go Matt.

394
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,010
字幕
Head.

395
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:17,480
字幕
Err what was next? Leg! Stomach! Head again!

396
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,280
字幕
  Richard

397
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,230
字幕
Round 2.

398
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,670
字幕
Yes round 2.

399
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,490
字幕
That’s my signature.

400
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:30,280
字幕
Fantastic.

401
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,580
字幕
He’s been tangoed.

402
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:35,860
字幕
  Only one thing can top this adrenaline rush, and that’s ‘dot dot dot’…

403
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,660
字幕
And then a certificate do we?

404
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,950
字幕
Yes sure, you get a certificate.

405
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,380
字幕
Great they’ve dipped it in tea!

406
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,440
字幕
You will get a Latin name as well.

407
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,540
字幕
Your new name is Crixvs.

408
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,900
字幕
He’s the best friend of Spartacus.

409
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,010
字幕
Ah lovely, did he stand up for him though?

410
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,410
字幕
No he was crucified.

411
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,060
字幕
Ohhh.

412
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,060
字幕
Now Matt, your new name is Spartacus!

413
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:55,760
字幕
Hey.

414
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,300
字幕
He gets Spartacus and I get crucified Crixvs?!

415
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,980
字幕
He died first.

416
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,480
字幕
Spartacus gets top billing I mean there wasn’t Crixvs the movie.

417
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,960
字幕
Having sacked Rome for culture, history,

418
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,370
字幕
and cuisine it’s time to swipe some swag!

419
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,100
字幕
So we head to the Via Margutta, home to La Bottega del Marmoraro

420
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,760
字幕
where two generations of the Fiorentini Family

421
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,290
字幕
have carved marble tablets to order.

422
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,050
字幕
This place is ‘marbleous’

423
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,720
字幕
Haha, I do not understand English.

424
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,680
字幕
Armed only with a humble translation app on a smart phone,

425
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,260
字幕
we effortlessly enter into life-affirming dialogue

426
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:37,000
字幕
Thank you for having us visit your shop.

427
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:46,480
字幕
Tell me, please, why do you carve marble?

428
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,200
字幕
Whoa,whoa,whoa

429
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,780
字幕
Nepotism is the answer.

430
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,440
字幕
Because we did not want it,

431
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,930
字幕
because my dad did it, continues to do it.

432
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,720
字幕
We soon reach our modest data limit and are forced to put nib to pad.

433
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,880
字幕
That’s the date of birth and then I only need to-

434
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,230
字幕
cause that will save my estate.

435
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,240
字幕
And me…

436

Ok one hour.

439
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,750
字幕
One hour?!

440
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,540

00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:48,160
字幕
Once more we must rely on a Bafta-baiting montage

444
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,560
字幕
in order to compress this eternity.

445
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,460
字幕
Hello once more.

446

‘Forza Gunners’ well that’s wonderful thank you very much.

448
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:07,540

I tell you what, I’m less happy, because, look,

449
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,290
字幕

450
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:15,490

454
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,850

Where are you going to be buried?

455
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:22,960
字幕
Somewhere small.

456
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,940
字幕
There’s your thirty euros.

457
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,580
字幕

458
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,780

字幕
we select to the cultural and political epicentre of ancient Rome, the Forum.

467
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,070
字幕
Thought, reflections, assessments.

468
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:00,020
字幕
I enjoyed being in a Fiat

469
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,730
字幕
with someone who’s an even worse driver than I am.

470
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,840
字幕
How dare you! I’m very pleased with the hat purchase.

471
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,890
字幕
I, regret mine a little…

472
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:08,320
字幕
Why?

473
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,427
字幕
I fear if I was to wear this out shopping,

474
00:22:12,427 --> 00:22:14,430
字幕
I might get one or two comments.

475
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,730
字幕
Like ‘nice hat-Where can I get one?’

476
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,320
字幕
You’ve had a nice time haven’t you?

477
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,230
字幕
It’s been a belter.

478
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,260
字幕
If I had to pick a favourite moment,

479
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,530
字幕
I’d say the moment the lasted two days,

480
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:30,190
字幕
in which I spent time with you and I got to know you a bit more.

481
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,470

Stop it.

482

485
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,580
字幕
Cars running.

486
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,610
字幕
Lovely.

487
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,770
字幕
Do you want to sit in the front you get car sick.

488
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:44,960
字幕
I get travel sick- this whole things a disaster.
