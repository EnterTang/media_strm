<i>For a long time,</i>

3
00:00:25,228 --> 00:00:28,711
<i>I'd walk into work
convinced they all knew,</i>

4
00:00:28,745 --> 00:00:31,557
<i>they saw right through me,
me and my innocent act,</i>

5
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:33,362
<i>which never used
to be an act...</i>

6
00:00:33,395 --> 00:00:34,834
<i>it's who I really was.</i>

7
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,934
<i>I would never
do anything bad, ever!</i>

8
00:00:37,967 --> 00:00:40,285
<i>I always imagined myself
having a simple life...</i>

9
00:00:40,335 --> 00:00:43,786
<i>find a nice guy, settle down,
live happily ever after.</i>

10
00:00:43,818 --> 00:00:45,289
<i>Who would've thought...</i>

11
00:00:45,322 --> 00:00:47,718
<i>looking for love
would be so tricky?</i>

12
00:00:47,751 --> 00:00:49,349
<i>But like mom always said,</i>

13
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:52,660
<i>"Sarah Jane, ambition will put
you in an early grave".</i>

14
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:06,542
<i>That's me,
Sarah Jane McKinney,</i>

15
00:03:06,575 --> 00:03:08,605
<i>Administrative assistant
at Judge pharmaceuticals.</i>

16
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,779
<i>Okay, I was a secretary,</i>

17
00:03:12,811 --> 00:03:15,527
<i>Five years and counting.
I was good at my job,</i>

18
00:03:15,673 --> 00:03:18,438
<i>and I even liked it
most of the time.</i>

19
00:03:18,471 --> 00:03:19,525
<i>But you know what they say...</i>

20
00:03:19,557 --> 00:03:21,810
<i>a job doesn't keep you
warm at night...</i>

21
00:03:21,844 --> 00:03:23,265
<i>or make your heart
skip a beat.</i>

22
00:03:23,297 --> 00:03:24,769
<i>I was beginning to wonder...</i>

23
00:03:24,785 --> 00:03:27,454
<i>had my life been jinxed
right from the start?</i>

24
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:35,334
<i>When I was a kid,
I was mom's little movie star,</i>

25
00:03:35,367 --> 00:03:38,053
<i>which explains why she did me up
just like Audrey Hepburn...</i>

26
00:03:38,087 --> 00:03:40,530
<i>for the St. George's
beauty pageant.</i>

27
00:03:40,563 --> 00:03:42,209
<i>Well, that's mom.</i>

28
00:03:42,241 --> 00:03:45,102
<i>I tried to make her happy,
and for good reason...</i>

29
00:03:45,135 --> 00:03:46,350
<i>- Claire!
- My dad.</i>

30
00:03:47,965 --> 00:03:49,756
Claire!

31
00:03:50,843 --> 00:03:54,406
The divorce papers clearly state
that I got rights!

32
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,212
Now, where's
my goddamn daughter?

33
00:03:56,245 --> 00:03:57,332
Shh! Shut up.

34
00:03:57,365 --> 00:03:58,963
Get off me!
Stop!

35
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:03,774
<i>My mom believed in karma,</i>

36
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,964
<i>that we all got
what we deserved.</i>

37
00:04:08,968 --> 00:04:10,716
<i>But me, I...</i>

38
00:04:11,148 --> 00:04:13,942
<i>I leaned more towards
divine intervention,</i>

39
00:04:13,975 --> 00:04:15,843
<i>my guardian angel.</i>

40
00:04:19,444 --> 00:04:21,375
<i>St. George.</i>

41
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:23,583
<i>Dragon slayer,
patron saint of chivalry,</i>

42
00:04:23,615 --> 00:04:27,320
<i>knights, romance...</i>

43
00:04:27,353 --> 00:04:28,490
<i>and justice.</i>

44
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,603
<i>but ever since then,</i>

45
00:04:44,637 --> 00:04:46,570
<i>St. George
has watched out for me.</i>

46
00:04:46,602 --> 00:04:48,008
<i>Take frankie sheftell.</i>

47
00:04:50,071 --> 00:04:52,995
<i>I thought Frankie was
everything a girl could want...</i>

48
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:56,396
<i>popular...</i>

49
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,313
<i>athletic...</i>

50
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,715
<i>A serious hottie.</i>

51
00:05:07,787 --> 00:05:11,124
<i>Oh, don't worry.
He survived.</i>

52
00:05:11,621 --> 00:05:12,962
<i>He even asked me
to marry him...</i>

53
00:05:12,995 --> 00:05:15,024
<i>over a milkshake
at the dairy joy.</i>

54
00:05:15,056 --> 00:05:17,774
<i>Mom was heartbroken when
he ditched me at the altar,</i>

55
00:05:17,808 --> 00:05:19,773
<i>but really St. George
had sent me...</i>

56
00:05:19,807 --> 00:05:21,612
<i>another blessing
in disguise.</i>

57
00:05:21,644 --> 00:05:24,921
<i>The blessing was
the salad girl from pizza hut,</i>

58
00:05:24,953 --> 00:05:26,822
<i>and her name turned out
to be Dick.</i>

59
00:05:28,823 --> 00:05:32,290
<i>Was I unlucky in love?</i>

60
00:05:32,323 --> 00:05:33,730
<i>You never really know.</i>

61
00:05:33,763 --> 00:05:35,951
<i>I trusted my guardian angel.</i>

62
00:05:35,984 --> 00:05:38,925
<i>St. George would guide me
to my knight in shining armor.</i>

63
00:05:38,957 --> 00:05:41,307
Please, please, please
grant me this wish.

64
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,209
Show me the right path,

65
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:45,942
And I promise
I will never let you down,

66
00:05:45,975 --> 00:05:49,189
never, ever, ever.

67
00:05:49,222 --> 00:05:51,043
Honest.

68
00:05:52,627 --> 00:05:54,192
I swear it.

69
00:05:57,263 --> 00:06:00,546
<i>I faced life at Judge
one day at a time...</i>

70
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:04,376
<i>with my bff,
Charmaine Abatemarco.</i>

71
00:06:04,408 --> 00:06:05,908
Posted right there
on the board.

72
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,691
I says to myself,
"Charmaine," I says...

73
00:06:08,724 --> 00:06:11,968
<i>That's so Charmaine,
always with the big plans.</i>

74
00:06:12,001 --> 00:06:14,397
<i>She had ambition.
I wish I had big plans.</i>

75
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,997
You know what
I'm saying? Hey!

76
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:17,083
Hmm?

77
00:06:17,116 --> 00:06:19,753
So I applied,
and I will not be denied.

78
00:06:19,785 --> 00:06:21,625
You should totally
apply, too.

79
00:06:21,993 --> 00:06:23,958
I mean, I don't know
if you'll get it,

80
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:25,506
'cause I have
more experience,

81
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:27,203
but you should
definitely try.

82
00:06:30,288 --> 00:06:32,049
- Lie?
- That's right, lie.

83
00:06:32,081 --> 00:06:34,125
If you want this gig,
you gotta get...

84
00:06:34,158 --> 00:06:36,186
a little loosey-goosey
with the facts.

85
00:06:36,427 --> 00:06:37,946
I know, but a master's
in chemistry?

86
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,041
Look, judge pharmaceuticals
is a drug company, right?

87
00:06:40,074 --> 00:06:42,230
Well, if you want to be
an executive,

88
00:06:42,262 --> 00:06:44,739
vast right-wing conspiracy,
you gotta smell like one.

89
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:47,490
Yeah, but, mom, it's just...
it's so wrong.

90
00:06:50,175 --> 00:06:51,455
What if they check up?

91
00:06:51,488 --> 00:06:53,836
That's the beauty of lying,
baby, the never do.

92
00:06:53,868 --> 00:06:55,402
They're too busy
lying to themselves.

93
00:06:55,435 --> 00:06:58,904
Come on, honey, look,
do you wanna be like me,

94
00:06:58,937 --> 00:07:00,709
or do you wanna be like me?

95
00:07:02,567 --> 00:07:03,715
Oh, Mr...

96
00:07:03,748 --> 00:07:04,849
No, mom,
I got it.

97
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,721
Swallowed
your dentures again!

98
00:07:06,754 --> 00:07:09,105
Mr. Ketchum!
Mr. Ketchum!

99
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,478
There you go.
Cough 'em up.

100
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,189
Cough 'em
right there.

101
00:07:12,222 --> 00:07:14,140
<i>That's our boarder,
Mr. Ketchum.</i>

102
00:07:14,172 --> 00:07:18,215
<i>Mom was so tired of fishing
his dentures out of the toilet,</i>

103
00:07:18,265 --> 00:07:20,022
<i>but he was a sweet old man...</i>

104
00:07:20,054 --> 00:07:23,492
<i>although his alzheimer's
was definitely getting worse.</i>

105
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:29,278
Uh, Mr. Ketchum?

106
00:07:29,311 --> 00:07:31,740
<i>Just once,
why couldn't mom rent...</i>

107
00:07:31,772 --> 00:07:33,531
<i>to some young,
handsome guy?</i>

108
00:07:33,565 --> 00:07:35,543
Mr. Ketchum?
Dorothy?

109
00:07:35,576 --> 00:07:39,192
Mr. Ketchum! Hi.

110
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,202
I'm okay.

111
00:07:41,236 --> 00:07:44,096
Me too.

112
00:07:45,712 --> 00:07:47,248
Thanks.

113
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:51,179
You okay,
Mr. Ketchum?

114
00:07:51,213 --> 00:07:53,146
Okay, Mr. Ketchum,
let's go.

115
00:07:53,179 --> 00:07:57,462
Upstairs, beddy-bye.

116
00:07:57,496 --> 00:08:00,163
Go on, you old fart.

117
00:08:00,196 --> 00:08:02,770
How he pays his rent,
I'll never know.

118
00:08:02,802 --> 00:08:06,621
Must have some money buried
in the cellar, huh?

119
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:08,397
Oh, oh!
Oh, and Madame Curie,

120
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,522
"chemistry's" spelled
with one "m," not two.

121
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:12,168
Hmm.

122
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,141
<i>"Dear Mr. Gabowski,
I have been...</i>

123
00:08:17,174 --> 00:08:18,772
<i>an administrative assistant
at Judge"...</i>

124
00:08:18,806 --> 00:08:22,528
<i>I worked on that application
until 3:00 in the morning.</i>

125
00:08:22,562 --> 00:08:24,846
<i>I told them
that I loved chemistry,</i>

126
00:08:24,878 --> 00:08:27,036
<i>that I loved
Judge pharmaceuticals,</i>

127
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:31,016
<i>and that I knew that company
from the inside out.</i>

128
00:08:31,049 --> 00:08:33,111
<i>I didn't think of it
as lying,</i>

129
00:08:33,143 --> 00:08:34,901
<i>just embellishing
a bit.</i>

130
00:08:34,934 --> 00:08:37,316
<i>Look, I omitted the part
about being nominated...</i>

131
00:08:37,348 --> 00:08:38,692
<i>for a nobel peace prize.</i>

132
00:08:38,724 --> 00:08:41,633
<i>St. George would grant me
some wiggle room.</i>

133
00:09:04,829 --> 00:09:07,802
- Oh, my god.
- What?

134
00:09:07,835 --> 00:09:10,023
- You got it!
- No!

135
00:09:10,056 --> 00:09:14,628
<i>Yes! A junior executive.</i>

136
00:09:14,661 --> 00:09:17,842
<i>St. George and I
were on our way up.</i>

137
00:09:19,488 --> 00:09:20,957
<i>Secretary-wise,</i>

138
00:09:20,991 --> 00:09:23,356
<i>I knew everybody
and everybody knew me.</i>

139
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:25,770
<i>There wasn't a xerox copier
I couldn't ink,</i>

140
00:09:26,202 --> 00:09:29,112
<i>a bigalow's tea bag
I couldn't locate.</i>

141
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,845
<i>But that? That was
ancient history.</i>

142
00:09:31,878 --> 00:09:34,961
<i>I'd moved up to
Judge pharmaceuticals...</i>

143
00:09:34,994 --> 00:09:38,496
<i>famed division four.</i>

144
00:09:43,469 --> 00:09:45,688
<i>My first day
as a junior executive,</i>

145
00:09:45,722 --> 00:09:48,934
<i>I toasted St. George with a double-shot
low-fat hazelnut latte...</i>

146
00:09:48,968 --> 00:09:51,348
<i>and fortified myself
with Estee Lauder...</i>

147
00:09:51,381 --> 00:09:52,402
<i>perfume freebies
at Nordstrom's.</i>

148
00:09:53,876 --> 00:09:56,223
Stop by confession first
or Nordstrom's?

149
00:09:56,256 --> 00:09:57,791
Nordstrom's.
Mm. Sexy.

150
00:09:57,824 --> 00:09:59,390
- Constipated, period?
- Nope.

151
00:09:59,422 --> 00:10:01,226
- Cramps, eczema, asthma?
- No.

152
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:03,115
Mm. Ah-ha. So.

153
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,136
You gonna knock 'em dead
or what?

154
00:10:06,168 --> 00:10:07,560
Do I know you
from somewhere?

155
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:10,803
Charmaine Abatemarco,
honeybun.

156
00:10:10,835 --> 00:10:12,866
Seventy-five words per minute,
coffee always fresh,

157
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:15,710
and don't you dare forget me.
Hey, Sarah Jane!

158
00:10:17,598 --> 00:10:19,931
Don't you dare.

159
00:10:35,711 --> 00:10:38,253
Oh. Uh, you must be
Miss McKinney.

160
00:10:39,563 --> 00:10:41,434
Milo Beeber.

161
00:10:43,272 --> 00:10:44,405
They didn't tell you.

162
00:10:44,455 --> 00:10:45,989
Tell me?

163
00:10:46,614 --> 00:10:48,052
St. Louis division
flew me in last Friday.

164
00:10:48,085 --> 00:10:49,603
They didn't tell you.

165
00:10:49,636 --> 00:10:51,441
Oh, a... all I know
is that I applied...

166
00:10:51,473 --> 00:10:53,598
for this job a month ago,
and Mr. Grabow...

167
00:10:53,632 --> 00:10:55,181
Grabowski's been fired.

168
00:10:55,215 --> 00:10:56,589
Oh.

169
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:58,475
Promotion's off.

170
00:10:58,508 --> 00:11:00,216
Oh.

171
00:11:00,249 --> 00:11:03,511
Um, I assume
this is yours, yes?

172
00:11:03,543 --> 00:11:05,492
Uh-huh.

173
00:11:07,396 --> 00:11:10,001
And...

174
00:11:11,025 --> 00:11:12,192
Yeah.

175
00:11:14,253 --> 00:11:15,867
I'm being let go?

176
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,691
Oh, no, nothing
like that.

177
00:11:17,725 --> 00:11:20,057
You get to be
my new secretary.

178
00:11:29,168 --> 00:11:31,054
Will that be all, sir?

179
00:11:31,087 --> 00:11:33,804
Um... Coffee.

180
00:11:39,737 --> 00:11:41,989
Coffee?! He actually
said that?

181
00:11:42,022 --> 00:11:45,523
Mm-hmm! Translation...
put up, suck up, or die!

182
00:11:45,555 --> 00:11:47,841
But still, oh!
Ugh!

183
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,542
He's kind of cute.
Charmaine Abatemarco!

184
00:11:50,574 --> 00:11:54,230
I'm just saying, you know,
he could be quite a catch.

185
00:11:54,231 --> 00:11:55,161
What?

186
00:11:55,162 --> 00:11:57,545
Sweetie, look.
It wasn't but a minute ago...

187
00:11:57,578 --> 00:11:59,943
you were all set
to marry Frankie numb-nuts.

188
00:11:59,976 --> 00:12:01,541
Remember him?
You wanted to start...

189
00:12:01,573 --> 00:12:02,724
popping out
little pygmies,

190
00:12:02,757 --> 00:12:04,593
grow an industrial-sized ass,
and settle down...

191
00:12:04,626 --> 00:12:06,673
for a nice long run
as a housefrau?...

192
00:12:07,297 --> 00:12:09,726
When that didn't fly, you set your sights
on the executive suites.

193
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,451
Why? Hey! 'Cause you're
a survivor, right?

194
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:15,207
All I'm selling now
is survive more!

195
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,320
Combine the two
and become Mrs. Beeber,

196
00:12:17,353 --> 00:12:19,269
Executive housefrau.

197
00:12:19,302 --> 00:12:21,252
No, uh-uh, no way.

198
00:12:21,285 --> 00:12:24,624
I don't even know if this Beeber guy
is even attracted to me.

199
00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:27,119
Rule of thumb...
if the new boss...

200
00:12:27,152 --> 00:12:28,989
is even
the least bit game,

201
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:31,963
he starts with
the wandering hand disease.

202
00:12:31,996 --> 00:12:33,482
<i>At first, his wrist...</i>

203
00:12:33,516 --> 00:12:35,735
<i>will accidentally
dust yours.</i>

204
00:12:35,768 --> 00:12:37,190
<i>This usually happens
after lunch...</i>

205
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:39,156
<i>like, 3:00
at the latest.</i>

206
00:12:39,189 --> 00:12:42,465
<i>By Thursday, he'll find some way
to stroke your cheek.</i>

207
00:12:42,498 --> 00:12:44,479
<i>It's all very subtle
at first.</i>

208
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:47,198
<i>He'll think it's you,
but it's not.</i>

209
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,483
<i>in a week,
if he's still hot to trot,</i>

210
00:12:49,515 --> 00:12:51,354
<i>he'll chummy up with
an innocent backrub.</i>

211
00:12:51,386 --> 00:12:53,974
<i>Bosses are the easiest
men to screw.</i>

212
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:57,142
<i>Char had a point!</i>

213
00:12:57,173 --> 00:12:59,602
<i>He certainly was touchy.</i>

214
00:12:59,636 --> 00:13:02,129
<i>On the other hand...</i>

215
00:13:02,163 --> 00:13:03,854
I mean, I have been
half-fondled...

216
00:13:03,887 --> 00:13:06,492
and sexually harassed.

217
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,391
<i>I needed some advice...</i>

218
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,724
<i>from someone
who knew about men.</i>

219
00:13:14,757 --> 00:13:17,762
As far as
the target gender goes,

220
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:18,707
This little number?

221
00:13:18,739 --> 00:13:21,185
Guaranteed erection.

222
00:13:21,202 --> 00:13:22,832
Mom, you want me
to wear that?

223
00:13:22,865 --> 00:13:24,812
Oh, listen, doll!

224
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,692
Sex-wise, men are obsessed
with four things.

225
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:29,720
Two of them,
like cow udders, fit here,

226
00:13:29,754 --> 00:13:31,815
the third is a foul
and disgusting jungle,

227
00:13:31,848 --> 00:13:34,819
and the fourth is some bizarre fetish
having to do with calf muscles,

228
00:13:34,852 --> 00:13:38,625
hence my all-purpose
come-fuck-me pumps.

229
00:13:38,658 --> 00:13:40,031
Double bueno!

230
00:13:40,064 --> 00:13:43,246
You'll be the ho
I always hoped for.

231
00:13:53,301 --> 00:13:55,905
<i>You know how every girl
has worn that one dress...</i>

232
00:13:55,938 --> 00:13:59,102
<i>that was just
an inch too short...</i>

233
00:13:59,135 --> 00:14:01,358
<i>or maybe four to five inches?</i>

234
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:04,346
<i>In any event, it seemed
to be working.</i>

235
00:14:10,342 --> 00:14:12,661
<i>I was getting noticed!</i>

236
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,761
<i>I was on my way up.</i>

237
00:14:21,531 --> 00:14:22,556
Are you all right?

238
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:30,948
It's almost 6:00.

239
00:14:30,982 --> 00:14:33,842
How's about you
go grab the files,

240
00:14:33,891 --> 00:14:36,175
and, uh...
we'll work through dinner.

241
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,184
You like Chinese food?

242
00:14:37,457 --> 00:14:39,358
I love Chinese food.

243
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,531
Good. I know
the perfect spot.

244
00:14:41,563 --> 00:14:44,279
<i>How about
this hemorrhoid cream?</i>

245
00:14:44,311 --> 00:14:46,663
Stats say
it's a top seller.

246
00:14:46,695 --> 00:14:48,948
<i>One mu shu pork
and three mai tais later,</i>

247
00:14:48,965 --> 00:14:50,387
<i>I found myself
drifting off.</i>

248
00:14:50,404 --> 00:14:52,816
Why are people needing
so much hemorrhoid cream?

249
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,383
Rear schmear.

250
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:55,919
<i>But Mr. Beeber
kept talking work...</i>

251
00:14:55,952 --> 00:14:57,774
Write that down.
We'll bring that up.

252
00:14:57,806 --> 00:15:00,026
<i>...And I wanted him
talking us.</i>

253
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:02,539
Rear schmear.
It's the whole rhyming thing.

254
00:15:02,571 --> 00:15:04,727
<i>It's like mom
always said.</i>

255
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,455
<i>Best way to keep
a man interested?</i>

256
00:15:06,487 --> 00:15:08,245
<i>Get him talking
about himself.</i>

257
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:10,769
Mr. Beeber?
I... I can't help wondering.

258
00:15:10,802 --> 00:15:12,672
I mean, you have
this mile-long resume.

259
00:15:12,705 --> 00:15:14,414
Why...

260
00:15:14,976 --> 00:15:15,949
why did I accept
this position?

261
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:18,644
I mean, it kind of seems
like a step down.

262
00:15:18,645 --> 00:15:19,562
No offense.

263
00:15:19,563 --> 00:15:21,401
New job.

264
00:15:21,434 --> 00:15:23,368
Gotcha. Bored.

265
00:15:23,401 --> 00:15:26,516
No, new job. N-e-w j-o-b.

266
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,483
Nether, everwright,

267
00:15:28,515 --> 00:15:30,242
Wilder, Jejeune,

268
00:15:30,274 --> 00:15:33,039
Ormsby, and Bardo.

269
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,796
See, back in St. Louis,

270
00:15:36,845 --> 00:15:39,545
the head honchos
are entrenched for life.

271
00:15:39,578 --> 00:15:42,455
There's no chance
for me to move up.

272
00:15:42,488 --> 00:15:45,987
But... here,

273
00:15:46,021 --> 00:15:48,578
the right exec can gut
the competition...

274
00:15:48,611 --> 00:15:51,519
and move straight
to the top.

275
00:15:53,837 --> 00:15:54,859
New job.

276
00:15:54,894 --> 00:15:56,861
"How does he plan
to do this?" She asks.

277
00:15:56,893 --> 00:15:59,656
With this little blue pill.

278
00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:00,790
Clarity.

279
00:16:00,824 --> 00:16:02,021
Clarity.

280
00:16:02,054 --> 00:16:04,562
It reverses
age-onset senility.

281
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:05,586
Clarity has been
developed years ago.

282
00:16:05,618 --> 00:16:07,329
It had only been tested
a little bit...

283
00:16:07,362 --> 00:16:08,768
and then mothballed
due to budget cuts.

284
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,367
The one thing
he was convinced of,

285
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,365
it was sure to be
the next wonder drug.

286
00:16:12,398 --> 00:16:13,435
Maybe Charmaine
was right!

287
00:16:13,468 --> 00:16:15,531
Maybe this guy
was a catch!

288
00:16:15,564 --> 00:16:17,723
- Business is like chess, Sarah Jane.
- Yeah?

289
00:16:17,755 --> 00:16:19,240
You always gotta think
three moves ahead.

290
00:16:19,273 --> 00:16:24,882
Like, when I stole your job
and insisted you work for me...

291
00:16:24,915 --> 00:16:27,597
- I wanted you on my side.
- You did?

292
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:31,229
The question is, do you stick around
and play my queen,

293
00:16:31,262 --> 00:16:33,786
or stay the pawn?

294
00:16:33,818 --> 00:16:35,257
Queen sounds real nice.

295
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:38,342
Let's say we finish up
back at my place.

296
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,608
Excuse me.

297
00:16:50,908 --> 00:16:53,513
All right.
It's right in here.

298
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,728
Oh.

299
00:16:57,256 --> 00:16:58,789
Ah! Home base.

300
00:17:03,235 --> 00:17:04,416
Make yourself at home.

301
00:17:06,768 --> 00:17:08,126
Nice place.

302
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:10,444
Thank you.
I just moved in,

303
00:17:10,477 --> 00:17:11,532
so please excuse the mess.

304
00:17:11,565 --> 00:17:12,840
Mm.

305
00:17:12,873 --> 00:17:15,878
Yeah, I made a killing
on a foreclosure sale.

306
00:17:17,382 --> 00:17:19,043
Here you are.

307
00:17:21,587 --> 00:17:24,430
To subprime
bankruptcies.

308
00:17:24,464 --> 00:17:27,021
To subprime
bankruptcies.

309
00:17:45,055 --> 00:17:48,043
Hmm! Uh,
just a second. Sorry.

310
00:17:57,172 --> 00:17:59,456
Sorry about that,
but for a moment there,

311
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,489
I thought it was
my fiancee.

312
00:18:01,522 --> 00:18:03,836
What? Fiancee?

313
00:18:03,869 --> 00:18:05,740
Mm-hmm.

314
00:18:05,774 --> 00:18:08,122
You... you mean
you're engaged?

315
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:09,528
Yeah.

316
00:18:09,562 --> 00:18:12,535
Wait, we're
not gonna date?

317
00:18:12,568 --> 00:18:16,660
Date? You and me?
No, of course not.

318
00:18:16,691 --> 00:18:18,161
Why not?

319
00:18:18,195 --> 00:18:19,919
I mean...

320
00:18:19,951 --> 00:18:22,510
then why am I here?

321
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:24,699
It...
you're my secretary.

322
00:18:24,733 --> 00:18:26,764
I always have sex
with my secretary.

323
00:18:26,795 --> 00:18:28,329
What...
Yeah.

324
00:18:28,361 --> 00:18:29,416
Um...

325
00:18:29,449 --> 00:18:31,268
It's...

326
00:18:31,302 --> 00:18:32,405
Mr. Beeber!

327
00:18:32,437 --> 00:18:34,162
The ladder!
I like it on the ladder.

328
00:18:34,195 --> 00:18:35,283
Haven't tried it
that way yet.

329
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:38,528
Get off of me!
You just get off of me!

330
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,829
Mr. Beeber.
Mr. Beeber!

331
00:18:40,862 --> 00:18:41,822
Uh! Ooh!

332
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,914
Feisty.

333
00:18:43,946 --> 00:18:45,751
Mr. Beeber, I said no!

334
00:18:45,752 --> 00:18:46,690
Oh!

335
00:18:54,338 --> 00:18:56,208
Mr. Beeber?

336
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,501
Are you okay?

337
00:19:38,084 --> 00:19:40,019
<i>Next day, it was there
on my face...</i>

338
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:42,515
<i>for all the world to see...</i>

339
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:44,417
<i>Guilty.</i>

340
00:19:54,468 --> 00:19:57,059
Ah, there she is.

341
00:19:57,093 --> 00:19:59,060
Sarah Jane McKinney?

342
00:19:59,092 --> 00:20:00,996
<i>Yes.
It was the police.</i>

343
00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:02,212
Put out
your hands, please.

344
00:20:02,245 --> 00:20:05,444
<i>They'd found out.
I was sure of it.</i>

345
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,723
Congratulations. You've got your promotion.
What?

346
00:20:08,757 --> 00:20:11,571
We just flew in from the head office
to give you the news.

347
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:13,412
It seems that
Mr. Beeber's had,

348
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:17,205
Well, a rather
unfortunate accident.

349
00:20:17,238 --> 00:20:20,213
No.

350
00:20:20,246 --> 00:20:22,998
I... I hope he is all right.

351
00:20:23,031 --> 00:20:25,060
An umbrella just, uh...

352
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:27,287
right through.
Well, it's tragic, really.

353
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,574
But the good new is
is that you're next in line.

354
00:20:29,607 --> 00:20:31,382
That is good news.
So look on the bright side.

355
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:32,839
His loss
is your gain.

356
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,536
<i>I finally had
my promotion!</i>

357
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:45,783
<i>I did write
a nice sympathy note...</i>

358
00:20:45,816 --> 00:20:47,193
<i>to Mr. Beeber's fiancee.</i>

359
00:20:47,225 --> 00:20:49,976
<i>I was sorry for her...</i>

360
00:20:50,008 --> 00:20:53,177
<i>even if she was going
to marry a lech.</i>

361
00:21:00,777 --> 00:21:03,657
<i>It didn't take a genius
to see that none of the execs...</i>

362
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:06,937
<i>had a clue about the horrors
of cellulite... or cared!</i>

363
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:10,745
In short, fat cells
push up against fibrous tissue...

364
00:21:10,777 --> 00:21:13,338
to form clumps of fat
called cellulite.

365
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:16,956
Cream-wise, nothing we have
puts a dent in it.

366
00:21:16,989 --> 00:21:20,298
<i>Maybe I wasn't as far
out of my league as I thought.</i>

367
00:21:20,604 --> 00:21:22,475
<i>Meet Cynthia Bardo.</i>

368
00:21:22,508 --> 00:21:25,449
<i>Ms. Bardo had been crated in
from the new England branch.</i>

369
00:21:25,482 --> 00:21:26,956
<i>Her main expertise?</i>

370
00:21:26,989 --> 00:21:31,338
<i>Sales, with a side order
of s-e-x.</i>

371
00:21:31,372 --> 00:21:34,058
<i>Leonard Ormsby,
marketing guru.</i>

372
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,620
<i>Leonard's wife had recently
given him an ultimatum...</i>

373
00:21:36,653 --> 00:21:38,220
<i>either he lose
the blubber gut,</i>

374
00:21:38,252 --> 00:21:40,508
<i>or she'd divorce him
and marry his twin.</i>

375
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,381
<i>That's Joshua Nether,
head of finance...</i>

376
00:21:42,413 --> 00:21:44,236
<i>and our resident
sexual predator.</i>

377
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,302
<i>He thought of himself
as a lady-killer,</i>

378
00:21:46,335 --> 00:21:48,924
<i>but really all the ladies
wanted to kill him.</i>

379
00:21:48,956 --> 00:21:51,533
<i>Then there was Pierre Jejeune,
public relations.</i>

380
00:21:51,566 --> 00:21:53,868
<i>His superiors
thought he walked on water,</i>

381
00:21:53,901 --> 00:21:56,350
<i>but to everyone else,
total bottom feeder.</i>

382
00:21:59,455 --> 00:22:01,950
<i>Next up, Nan Wilder,
product development Czar...</i>

383
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,549
<i>and my boss.</i>

384
00:22:03,582 --> 00:22:05,486
<i>She was known
to play favorites.</i>

385
00:22:05,518 --> 00:22:09,070
<i>It's not a bad gig
if you can get it.</i>

386
00:22:09,104 --> 00:22:11,103
<i>Last but not least,
Mr. Hale Everwright,</i>

387
00:22:11,136 --> 00:22:13,325
<i>division four's
big man in charge.</i>

388
00:22:13,358 --> 00:22:16,399
<i>Apparently Mr. E. Had little,
if any idea what he was doing,</i>

389
00:22:16,432 --> 00:22:19,054
<i>but that didn't stop him
from leading division four...</i>

390
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:22,399
<i>with great,
albeit clueless, gusto.</i>

391
00:22:22,432 --> 00:22:26,689
<i>There you have it...
n/e/w j/o/b. New job.</i>

392
00:22:26,722 --> 00:22:30,465
Suppositories and wipes
are performing in the field.

393
00:22:30,497 --> 00:22:33,008
Excellent.
Very good work.

394
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,697
Sarah Jane.
Sarah.

395
00:22:34,698 --> 00:22:35,601
Jane.

396
00:22:35,602 --> 00:22:37,152
Jane.

397
00:22:37,186 --> 00:22:39,889
These psoriasis stats?

398
00:22:39,922 --> 00:22:41,025
So, our butt plugs and wipes...

399
00:22:41,057 --> 00:22:43,488
cause 10% of the public
to itch a twitch.

400
00:22:43,521 --> 00:22:46,482
What do we care if it works
for the other 90?

401
00:22:46,515 --> 00:22:49,362
Uh, well, in terms
of competition...

402
00:22:49,395 --> 00:22:52,753
Pierre's right.
If this goop sues...

403
00:22:52,786 --> 00:22:54,642
better yet, sells...
then that's why we...

404
00:22:55,012 --> 00:22:57,043
exist, isn't it,
to make profits?

405
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:58,643
Thank you for backing me
up on that.

406
00:22:58,675 --> 00:23:00,660
Good job,
Sarah Jane.

407
00:23:00,693 --> 00:23:02,339
<i>Their message was clear.</i>

408
00:23:02,371 --> 00:23:04,962
<i>The game is dog-eat-dog.</i>

409
00:23:06,484 --> 00:23:07,506
<i>Did I feel small?</i>

410
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:12,868
<i>Oh, yeah, so much
that I nearly confessed.</i>

411
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,932
Charmaine, what I'm
trying to say is that...

412
00:23:14,964 --> 00:23:17,733
I might have done
something bad, very bad.

413
00:23:17,765 --> 00:23:19,012
You gonna eat
your shrimp?

414
00:23:19,044 --> 00:23:21,332
Charmaine,
I'm talking here!

415
00:23:21,364 --> 00:23:22,292
Look, I know, all right?

416
00:23:22,326 --> 00:23:23,491
You know?

417
00:23:23,525 --> 00:23:24,741
Absolutely.

418
00:23:24,773 --> 00:23:26,653
Did you do bad?
No doubt about it.

419
00:23:26,662 --> 00:23:29,589
So your new challenge is
how fast can you score...

420
00:23:29,622 --> 00:23:31,349
before Wilder
fires your ass.

421
00:23:31,422 --> 00:23:32,884
Hold on. Wait.
I'm getting fired?

422
00:23:32,918 --> 00:23:37,009
Sarah Jane, give me
a swig of your coke.

423
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:38,324
The game is hardball.

424
00:23:38,325 --> 00:23:40,006
You gotta think
three steps ahead.

425
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:41,354
That's what Beeber said.

426
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:42,797
Beeber, schmeeber.

427
00:23:42,931 --> 00:23:47,479
The question is did he leave
anything behind that you can rip off?

428
00:23:47,512 --> 00:23:49,623
He never mentioned
some new malaria drug,

429
00:23:49,655 --> 00:23:52,579
- or, I don't know, a spiffy new ointment?
- Clarity.

430
00:23:52,612 --> 00:23:55,590
Missy, I think I'm being
plenty clear, right?

431
00:23:55,623 --> 00:23:57,223
Enough career talk.

432
00:23:58,824 --> 00:24:01,159
Hey, dish me.
Who'd you slay?

433
00:24:01,193 --> 00:24:02,280
What do you mean?

434
00:24:02,313 --> 00:24:03,960
Men, you nerdling!

435
00:24:03,993 --> 00:24:07,048
Oh! Which exec did you set
your beady little eyes on?

436
00:24:07,082 --> 00:24:10,697
Speak of the devil.

437
00:24:10,729 --> 00:24:12,729
Johnny, god!
Hi, there.

438
00:24:13,097 --> 00:24:14,728
What, baby?
Hey, Sarah Jane.

439
00:24:14,761 --> 00:24:17,018
So, is it true
what they say,

440
00:24:17,051 --> 00:24:19,017
Execs, uh, do it better?

441
00:24:19,049 --> 00:24:21,048
Cool breeze,
lay off.

442
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,248
All right, charmaine,
come on.

443
00:24:22,282 --> 00:24:24,201
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

444
00:24:24,233 --> 00:24:25,881
We only got an hour left.

445
00:24:25,914 --> 00:24:27,742
<i>That's Johnny,
Char's husband.</i>

446
00:24:27,776 --> 00:24:28,729
Sorry.

447
00:24:28,763 --> 00:24:30,585
<i>They were trying
for a baby...</i>

448
00:24:30,618 --> 00:24:32,026
Mm!

449
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:33,898
<i>but Char was still
sneaking the pill.</i>

450
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,651
<i>She said she liked
the extra attention.</i>

451
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:38,619
<i>Was I jealous of char?</i>

452
00:24:38,652 --> 00:24:40,971
<i>Maybe a little.</i>

453
00:24:41,005 --> 00:24:43,194
<i>But I had Clarity
to think about.</i>

454
00:24:43,226 --> 00:24:45,611
<i>The deeper I sank
my teeth into Clarity,</i>

455
00:24:45,644 --> 00:24:48,747
<i>the more I was convinced
I was onto something.</i>

456
00:24:48,781 --> 00:24:51,020
<i>With Clarity,
older lab rats...</i>

457
00:24:51,053 --> 00:24:53,788
<i>had increased their
cognitive abilities tenfold.</i>

458
00:24:53,821 --> 00:24:59,259
<i>I mean, who wouldn't want
smarter elderly rats?</i>

459
00:25:00,701 --> 00:25:04,668
So, with my ad campaign,

460
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,076
mouthwash sales could enjoy
an uptick of 3%.

461
00:25:10,845 --> 00:25:14,044
Care to comment,
Sarah Jane?

462
00:25:14,077 --> 00:25:16,558
Um...

463
00:25:16,591 --> 00:25:19,117
Why only three?

464
00:25:37,025 --> 00:25:38,942
- It's ridiculous, right?
- I know.

465
00:25:38,975 --> 00:25:41,136
- Do you agree?
- Yes, I do agree. I agree.

466
00:25:41,169 --> 00:25:44,671
And now they're enacting laws so we can't
even conduct research on illegal immigrants.

467
00:25:44,703 --> 00:25:46,450
I mean, american citizens,
okay, but foreigners?

468
00:25:46,482 --> 00:25:48,704
I mean,
how are we ever to know if...

469
00:25:48,737 --> 00:25:50,736
these idiotic drugs
actually work?

470
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,624
It's crazy.

471
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:03,951
<i>A surefire cure for alzheimer's
would be my ticket to success,</i>

472
00:26:03,985 --> 00:26:06,162
<i>but first I had to test it...</i>

473
00:26:06,195 --> 00:26:08,690
<i>on a living, breathing
human being...</i>

474
00:26:08,722 --> 00:26:11,922
<i>And I had
the perfect guinea pig.</i>

475
00:26:13,491 --> 00:26:15,700
<i>The following night
I slipped 10 milligrams...</i>

476
00:26:15,732 --> 00:26:18,771
<i>of Clarity into Mr. Ketchum's
mushroom soup.</i>

477
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,377
Uh, salty.

478
00:26:28,323 --> 00:26:31,363
Oh, for Christ's sake,
it's like caring for an infant.

479
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,269
Day one. Minor
motor control issues.

480
00:26:38,629 --> 00:26:40,404
Mr. Ketchum?

481
00:26:40,438 --> 00:26:41,621
Oh.

482
00:26:44,949 --> 00:26:47,206
<i>I couldn't let anyone
know I had Clarity,</i>

483
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:51,509
<i>so I had to do all my research
on the sly,</i>

484
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:55,510
<i>keep Clarity under wraps.</i>

485
00:26:55,543 --> 00:26:57,414
<i>It was
a delicate balancing act,</i>

486
00:26:57,447 --> 00:27:00,358
<i>so I prayed to St. George
for wisdom and patience...</i>

487
00:27:00,391 --> 00:27:03,638
<i>Patience to deal with
my personal secretary,</i>

488
00:27:03,671 --> 00:27:06,616
<i>L.J. Feffer.</i>

489
00:27:06,648 --> 00:27:11,527
L.J.! I'm expecting a very important call
from Miss Wilder.

490
00:27:18,761 --> 00:27:21,704
<i>Having a male secretary
was a nice twist,</i>

491
00:27:21,737 --> 00:27:23,302
<i>But seriously...</i>

492
00:27:23,335 --> 00:27:26,184
L.J.: Hello?
Is there anything else?

493
00:27:26,217 --> 00:27:29,080
<i>The wheel was spinning,
but the hamster was dead.</i>

494
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:30,489
Hel... hello?

495
00:27:32,921 --> 00:27:34,953
L.J., are you
buzzing me?

496
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,178
No. Hello?

497
00:27:37,211 --> 00:27:39,001
L.J.

498
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:41,962
<i>L.J.?
Huh?</i>

499
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:43,034
<i>Did you...
no. Hello?</i>

500
00:27:43,066 --> 00:27:44,393
Buzz me?

501
00:27:45,515 --> 00:27:47,643
Ugh.

502
00:27:47,675 --> 00:27:50,603
L.J., who was that?

503
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,627
Who was what?

504
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,595
On the phone?

505
00:27:53,596 --> 00:27:57,435
Um, I told her
that you were busy.

506
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:59,099
Told who?

507
00:27:59,132 --> 00:28:01,076
Um...

508
00:28:01,109 --> 00:28:02,028
Miss Wilder.

509
00:28:02,029 --> 00:28:04,075
Miss Wilder?
L.J., she's my boss!

510
00:28:04,108 --> 00:28:05,948
I was waiting for her call.

511
00:28:05,981 --> 00:28:08,859
I said that was
a very important call!

512
00:28:09,197 --> 00:28:11,580
Whoops. I didn't...
know that...

513
00:28:11,613 --> 00:28:13,500
I guess
that's my bad, hmm?

514
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,589
Is there anything else?

515
00:28:16,621 --> 00:28:21,037
Yes. Staples
are for paper,

516
00:28:21,071 --> 00:28:22,732
not for pants.

517
00:28:26,158 --> 00:28:30,060
I'll staple you. Stapler.

518
00:28:32,782 --> 00:28:34,525
- Miss Wilder?
- Ah.

519
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:38,623
Sarah Jane. Glad you stopped by.
Come on in.

520
00:28:38,656 --> 00:28:42,432
I'm having a bit of a problem
with your performance lately.

521
00:28:42,464 --> 00:28:43,695
It's too good.

522
00:28:43,727 --> 00:28:47,232
Gee. For a moment there...
threw you, huh?

523
00:28:47,265 --> 00:28:48,672
Mm.
Damn it.

524
00:28:48,704 --> 00:28:50,272
Now, orchids
I can deal with,

525
00:28:50,305 --> 00:28:53,247
but bonsais are so, uh,
touchy.

526
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,862
May I?

527
00:28:54,895 --> 00:28:55,803
Sure.

528
00:28:57,825 --> 00:29:00,079
Yeah, you're killing
them with kindness.

529
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,304
Bonsai plants,
you have to have a deft hand.

530
00:29:02,337 --> 00:29:04,239
Sort of, uh, flatter
them a little?

531
00:29:04,273 --> 00:29:08,559
Exactly. Next time, you just turn
the nozzle to "spray".

532
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,642
The girl even knows
plants.

533
00:29:12,673 --> 00:29:14,224
Miss Wilder...
Sarah Jane...

534
00:29:14,257 --> 00:29:15,939
Go ahead.

535
00:29:17,698 --> 00:29:19,824
Well...

536
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:22,578
I just wanted to say,

537
00:29:22,611 --> 00:29:24,418
woman to woman,

538
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,771
that I think that you rank
right up there...

539
00:29:26,804 --> 00:29:30,307
with, like,
I don't know. Oprah.

540
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,803
Why, Sarah Jane!

541
00:29:32,835 --> 00:29:34,402
Are you trying
to kiss my ass?

542
00:29:34,435 --> 00:29:36,276
Yes, ma'am,
I believe I am.

543
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:39,299
Good. It shows spunk.
Have a seat.

544
00:29:41,205 --> 00:29:43,970
Play the queen,
never the pawn.

545
00:29:44,003 --> 00:29:45,812
Mr. Beeber
taught me that.

546
00:29:45,845 --> 00:29:47,124
Really?

547
00:29:47,157 --> 00:29:49,539
Milo and I came up
in the company together.

548
00:29:49,573 --> 00:29:52,293
We even had
a pet project... Clarity.

549
00:29:52,325 --> 00:29:55,317
Hmm. Actually, I... I barely
got to know him.

550
00:29:55,351 --> 00:29:57,254
He was all penis.

551
00:29:57,288 --> 00:29:58,708
Gotcha.

552
00:29:58,741 --> 00:30:00,357
And I was
a headstrong woman...

553
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:03,204
in an increasingly
wussified man's world,

554
00:30:03,238 --> 00:30:04,901
so we joined forces...

555
00:30:04,934 --> 00:30:06,647
to get ahead.

556
00:30:08,341 --> 00:30:12,502
After all, we all
want to get ahead,

557
00:30:12,534 --> 00:30:13,780
don't we,
Sarah Jane?

558
00:30:13,813 --> 00:30:16,487
Miss Wilder, I'm not
getting your drift.

559
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,711
Then why are you holding
my old Clarity files?

560
00:30:18,743 --> 00:30:22,071
This? No.
No, no, no, you're mistaken.

561
00:30:22,104 --> 00:30:23,478
You know
what else I think?

562
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:27,159
I think that you were with Beeber
the night he died.

563
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:28,119
How can you... no...

564
00:30:28,152 --> 00:30:31,000
'cause that night,
Beeber texted me...

565
00:30:31,033 --> 00:30:34,231
your picture,
and typed in...

566
00:30:34,264 --> 00:30:36,025
that he was about
to bed you down.

567
00:30:37,529 --> 00:30:39,143
We were kinky that way.

568
00:30:40,409 --> 00:30:41,671
See?

569
00:30:45,627 --> 00:30:48,297
Mm!

570
00:30:48,329 --> 00:30:51,353
We went to dinner...

571
00:30:51,386 --> 00:30:52,777
that night, sure.

572
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,905
For work.

573
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:56,345
I... I just got confused...

574
00:30:56,379 --> 00:30:59,225
So, you were
with him that night?

575
00:30:59,339 --> 00:31:01,417
At dinner.
But not at his...

576
00:31:01,451 --> 00:31:04,730
Then why didn't you
call the police?

577
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:06,955
Because he stole my job,

578
00:31:06,988 --> 00:31:09,306
and... and I didn't think
that they would believe me.

579
00:31:09,339 --> 00:31:11,466
I mean, who am I?
I'm a nobody.

580
00:31:11,499 --> 00:31:12,809
Why don't we just
call the police,

581
00:31:12,843 --> 00:31:14,127
you know, tell them
your little story,

582
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,148
and see what they think.

583
00:31:15,181 --> 00:31:16,716
No, no, no, please don't.

584
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,323
Were you at
his place or not?

585
00:31:23,867 --> 00:31:26,603
You killed him,
didn't you?

586
00:31:26,637 --> 00:31:28,619
Miss Wilder, you have
to understand.

587
00:31:28,652 --> 00:31:30,395
He fell off
of this ladder...

588
00:31:30,427 --> 00:31:31,932
and landed on
this cheap umbrella.

589
00:31:32,334 --> 00:31:33,997
You mean
my housewarming gift?

590
00:31:34,029 --> 00:31:35,981
I'm so sorry.

591
00:31:36,013 --> 00:31:38,365
I didn't mean
to kill him.

592
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,717
Please, you have
to understand that.

593
00:31:40,751 --> 00:31:42,749
I swear. Just...

594
00:31:42,782 --> 00:31:44,285
don't call the police.

595
00:31:44,318 --> 00:31:47,981
Call the police?
Now?

596
00:31:48,014 --> 00:31:49,694
Why on earth
would I do that?

597
00:31:49,726 --> 00:31:51,437
No. No, no,
no, no, no.

598
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,654
No?

599
00:31:52,687 --> 00:31:54,734
I'll tell you what
I'll be wanting.

600
00:31:56,032 --> 00:31:59,135
You'll be giving me
80% of your paycheck...

601
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:01,630
each week in cash.

602
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,471
You can leave now.

603
00:32:10,465 --> 00:32:12,783
I had a difficult
decision to make...

604
00:32:13,216 --> 00:32:14,846
give in to
Miss Wilder's demands,

605
00:32:14,895 --> 00:32:17,776
electrocute her
at the water cooler,

606
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:19,089
or trip her
on the subway.

607
00:32:19,122 --> 00:32:20,976
<i>Tough choices.</i>

608
00:33:11,973 --> 00:33:15,781
<i>A sign!
St. George was with me.</i>

609
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:40,215
<i>"Mercy shall follow me
all the days of my life,</i>

610
00:33:40,248 --> 00:33:43,911
<i>and I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever".</i>

611
00:33:43,944 --> 00:33:46,889
It would be Miss Wilder's
fondest wish...

612
00:33:46,921 --> 00:33:50,199
that would you fill in
at her desk, Sarah Jane.

613
00:33:51,706 --> 00:33:55,305
<i>"Fondest wish".</i>

614
00:33:55,338 --> 00:33:57,512
<i>Still, I began to get
this feeling...</i>

615
00:33:57,545 --> 00:34:00,729
<i>the other execs
didn't like me very much.</i>

616
00:34:02,265 --> 00:34:05,561
<i>I needed guidance
from a higher source.</i>

617
00:34:05,594 --> 00:34:07,960
Look, St. George,
I know you just gave me a sign,

618
00:34:07,993 --> 00:34:09,561
but when I saw
those execs eyeballing me,

619
00:34:09,594 --> 00:34:10,969
it really got me thinking
that maybe...

620
00:34:11,003 --> 00:34:12,729
that legless George guy
was just a coincidence,

621
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:16,236
so no offense, but I'd
really like another sign,

622
00:34:16,268 --> 00:34:20,522
just, you know, to confirm
that I'm on the right track.

623
00:34:27,275 --> 00:34:29,499
Did I under-do the candles?

624
00:34:31,804 --> 00:34:32,986
No? Good. Okay.

625
00:34:39,517 --> 00:34:41,468
Sarah Jane!
Sarah Jane, we have mice!

626
00:34:41,501 --> 00:34:42,939
Don't just sit there!

627
00:34:42,971 --> 00:34:46,284
Come and help me catch
the little bastard! On, no!

628
00:34:54,783 --> 00:34:57,501
Aaah! Aaah!

629
00:34:57,533 --> 00:34:59,069
Aah! Aah!
Oh, my god.

630
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,941
St. George!

631
00:35:12,974 --> 00:35:15,951
Uh, no, ma'am,
knight in shining armor.

632
00:35:17,808 --> 00:35:23,647
Oh! Oh, my god.
I completely forgot.

633
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:26,160
Baby, meet
detective sergeant Bill Malloy,

634
00:35:26,193 --> 00:35:28,079
Our new boarder.

635
00:35:28,193 --> 00:35:30,783
Um, um, sergeant Malloy,

636
00:35:30,816 --> 00:35:32,943
This is my daughter,
Sarah Jane mckinney.

637
00:35:32,993 --> 00:35:34,945
She's an executive.

638
00:35:34,979 --> 00:35:37,712
Well, Sarah Jane, it's, uh,
it's very nice to meet you.

639
00:35:44,514 --> 00:35:47,633
<i>Detective sergeant
Bill Malloy.</i>

640
00:35:49,363 --> 00:35:54,242
<i>Mrs. Detective sergeant
Sarah Jane McKinney-Malloy.</i>

641
00:35:54,275 --> 00:35:56,579
<i>It was as if my dreams
were finally coming true!</i>

642
00:35:58,035 --> 00:35:59,649
I'm not rushing.

643
00:35:59,682 --> 00:36:01,441
And you're flushed.
Why are you flushed?

644
00:36:01,474 --> 00:36:03,954
- It's my rouge.
- Your rouge? Who the hell says "rouge"?

645
00:36:03,987 --> 00:36:05,170
Excuse me, sorry.

646
00:36:05,203 --> 00:36:06,611
What's with
all the smirking?

647
00:36:06,643 --> 00:36:08,051
- I'm not smirking.
- Ach!

648
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:11,683
I'm not.
Holy shit, it's a guy.

649
00:36:11,716 --> 00:36:13,316
Shh. It's not a guy.

650
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:17,684
Char... It's a guy.

651
00:36:20,548 --> 00:36:21,830
I was like
a fire hydrant.

652
00:36:21,863 --> 00:36:23,252
I... I couldn't shut off.

653
00:36:23,284 --> 00:36:24,629
I was so excited that...

654
00:36:24,661 --> 00:36:27,045
I feel embarrassed
even saying this,

655
00:36:27,078 --> 00:36:29,587
but I felt like
I was gonna faint.

656
00:36:29,637 --> 00:36:32,772
Yeah!
No kidding. Faint.

657
00:36:32,806 --> 00:36:36,342
<i>Anyway, I told Charmaine
everything I know...</i>

658
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:39,125
about sergeant
Bill Malloy.

659
00:36:39,158 --> 00:36:42,039
He was a cop,
but suspended.

660
00:36:42,072 --> 00:36:45,991
He'd gone too far in this
gang-related drug investigation.

661
00:36:46,025 --> 00:36:48,998
- D.A.'s turf, he'd said.
- D.A.'s turf?

662
00:36:50,935 --> 00:36:54,695
I mean,
how cool is that?

663
00:36:54,727 --> 00:36:57,671
Is everything
all right in there?

664
00:36:57,705 --> 00:37:00,854
I'm all right.

665
00:37:03,767 --> 00:37:06,424
Day 30. 20 milligrams.

666
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:10,567
Increased energy
and coordination.

667
00:37:10,601 --> 00:37:12,727
His captain
had to put him on ice...

668
00:37:12,761 --> 00:37:14,439
for a while
to simmer down.

669
00:37:14,472 --> 00:37:17,641
On ice! I mean,
don't you just love it?

670
00:37:17,673 --> 00:37:19,576
Oh...

671
00:37:19,609 --> 00:37:20,553
Hi.

672
00:37:20,587 --> 00:37:21,736
Hi.

673
00:37:43,659 --> 00:37:45,932
Ms. Abatemarco,
I've seen better handwriting...

674
00:37:45,964 --> 00:37:48,906
from a dead baboon...
not alive. Dead.

675
00:37:48,939 --> 00:37:51,676
Now, if I were a member
of, say, a state crime lab,

676
00:37:51,709 --> 00:37:53,739
<i>Maybe, maybe, I could
deciphering your scribbling.</i>

677
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,252
But I am not a member
of the state crime lab.

678
00:37:56,286 --> 00:38:00,300
Um, sorry. Mm...

679
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:03,755
A zib of baila?

680
00:38:03,788 --> 00:38:04,861
No.

681
00:38:04,893 --> 00:38:07,900
Um, Ballcock?
Bal... Ballyhock?

682
00:38:07,932 --> 00:38:09,020
No.

683
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:10,781
Bla... Blaylock?
Mr. Blaylock?

684
00:38:10,814 --> 00:38:12,460
Blaylock.

685
00:38:12,493 --> 00:38:13,692
Blaylock.

686
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:16,431
Excellent. That was...
that was perfect.

687
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:18,653
The only problem is here
I needed to speak...

688
00:38:18,686 --> 00:38:20,126
to Mr. B... B... B... Blaylocke
yesterday!

689
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:22,301
But I couldn't speak
to Mr. B... B... B... Blaylocke...

690
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:23,517
yesterday,
because I mistook...

691
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,696
your fucking message
for a fucking doodle.

692
00:38:25,729 --> 00:38:27,534
Because no one in their
right fucking mind...

693
00:38:27,567 --> 00:38:29,790
would ever interpret
your fucking handwriting...

694
00:38:29,823 --> 00:38:31,150
as even remotely linked...

695
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:33,903
to the english
fucking language!

696
00:38:33,935 --> 00:38:36,511
<i>A few things
about Pierre Jejeune...</i>

697
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,430
<i>public relations
was his vehicle...</i>

698
00:38:38,463 --> 00:38:40,192
<i>for trading
inside information.</i>

699
00:38:40,225 --> 00:38:43,279
<i>Even the mayor
was in on the action.</i>

700
00:38:43,297 --> 00:38:45,937
<i>And he liked to sample
the secretarial buffet.</i>

701
00:38:45,969 --> 00:38:48,159
<i>Podophilia, it's called.</i>

702
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:51,584
<i>He also liked to watch.</i>

703
00:38:51,618 --> 00:38:53,104
<i>Billed his late-night
interoffice...</i>

704
00:38:53,136 --> 00:38:56,032
<i>popcorn porno parties
to his expense account.</i>

705
00:38:57,873 --> 00:38:59,297
Get out.
You're fired.

706
00:39:00,578 --> 00:39:02,208
Um, excuse me.

707
00:39:03,602 --> 00:39:05,713
But, uh, Charmaine,
L.J.'s moving...

708
00:39:05,747 --> 00:39:08,913
to Mr. Everwright's desk
next week, so you're hired.

709
00:39:09,379 --> 00:39:11,393
Um, but Mr. Jejeune,
he just...

710
00:39:11,426 --> 00:39:17,746
Charmaine. I said...
You're hired.

711
00:39:19,252 --> 00:39:21,538
Now, get your stuff and go.

712
00:39:21,571 --> 00:39:23,282
Okay.

713
00:39:35,381 --> 00:39:38,949
Wow. So, you like
to play games, McKinney.

714
00:39:38,981 --> 00:39:43,172
You think you got Clarity now?
Well, fine.

715
00:39:43,205 --> 00:39:46,309
Why don't you take your...

716
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:50,821
frisky little breasts
back to Miss Wilder's office...

717
00:39:50,853 --> 00:39:53,765
and you can conjure up
your little schemes.

718
00:39:53,799 --> 00:39:56,455
But when you're all
by your lonesome,

719
00:39:56,487 --> 00:39:58,390
remember this...

720
00:39:58,423 --> 00:40:01,431
we're not friends...

721
00:40:01,464 --> 00:40:05,175
anymore.

722
00:40:05,208 --> 00:40:08,694
 Tra-la-la la-la... 

723
00:40:09,943 --> 00:40:11,288
 la 

724
00:40:14,663 --> 00:40:16,583
<i>When he mentioned
Miss Wilder and Clarity...</i>

725
00:40:16,617 --> 00:40:20,711
<i>in the same breath,
I knew he'd sent the fax.</i>

726
00:40:20,745 --> 00:40:25,320
<i>If I learned anything
at Judge pharmaceutical,</i>

727
00:40:25,353 --> 00:40:27,592
<i>it's you have to think
three steps ahead.</i>

728
00:40:43,961 --> 00:40:47,001
Nether, you dirty dog!

729
00:40:48,459 --> 00:40:51,291
<i>Nether and Jejeune
had this running gag.</i>

730
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:53,898
<i>One would give the other
the hottest porn of the week.</i>

731
00:40:53,931 --> 00:40:56,572
<i>Then the recipient
would xerox his naked butt...</i>

732
00:40:56,604 --> 00:40:58,410
<i>and leave it
on the other's desk...</i>

733
00:40:58,442 --> 00:41:00,826
<i>as a token
of his appreciation.</i>

734
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:02,618
Ooh.

735
00:41:05,388 --> 00:41:07,996
 Tra-la-la la-la 

736
00:41:09,836 --> 00:41:11,004
 la 

737
00:41:41,713 --> 00:41:43,149
I've been bad, father.

738
00:41:43,183 --> 00:41:45,888
- Mm. How bad?
- Well, let's see.

739
00:41:45,889 --> 00:41:47,693
I have argued
with my mother...

740
00:41:48,191 --> 00:41:51,664
I've been prideful,
vain, unkind,

741
00:41:51,696 --> 00:41:53,533
And I killed a few people.

742
00:41:53,567 --> 00:41:55,633
You killed a few people?

743
00:41:55,665 --> 00:41:57,855
It wasn't
premeditated, though.

744
00:41:57,888 --> 00:42:00,944
Well, maybe sort of?
Does that count?

745
00:42:00,978 --> 00:42:03,103
And these murders,
where did they take place?

746
00:42:03,136 --> 00:42:04,929
- In a dream?
- Work.

747
00:42:04,962 --> 00:42:07,168
Work.
Mm.

748
00:42:07,201 --> 00:42:08,721
- Your boss?
- Yes.

749
00:42:08,753 --> 00:42:10,434
And others you've come in contact with.
Yes.

750
00:42:10,467 --> 00:42:11,726
And because
you don't like them,

751
00:42:11,758 --> 00:42:13,135
or hate then, even,

752
00:42:13,168 --> 00:42:15,057
it's your fault that they die.
Yes!

753
00:42:15,235 --> 00:42:17,583
Sarah Jane,
you have always had...

754
00:42:17,617 --> 00:42:19,248
a very vivid imagination.

755
00:42:19,281 --> 00:42:20,626
Yes.

756
00:42:20,659 --> 00:42:22,737
Oh, well, um...

757
00:42:22,769 --> 00:42:25,138
How come you
haven't been caught?

758
00:42:25,171 --> 00:42:26,099
St. George.

759
00:42:26,131 --> 00:42:27,057
St. George?

760
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:28,702
My guardian angel.

761
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,699
Oh.

762
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,506
Father Grisham, how else
do you explain...

763
00:42:31,539 --> 00:42:33,955
Mr. Perfect
becoming our boarder?

764
00:42:33,987 --> 00:42:37,410
and... and old Mr. Ketchum
progressing so nicely on Clarity?

765
00:42:37,442 --> 00:42:39,683
I mean, don't you see?
There is a pattern.

766
00:42:39,716 --> 00:42:42,386
So, I just figured
that if I came in here...

767
00:42:42,418 --> 00:42:44,180
and I cleared the air
a little,

768
00:42:44,212 --> 00:42:46,500
that maybe things
could get back to,

769
00:42:46,533 --> 00:42:48,996
you know,
normal.

770
00:42:49,028 --> 00:42:51,124
Normal.

771
00:42:51,156 --> 00:42:53,716
Well, uh, Sarah Jane,
this killing business...

772
00:42:53,748 --> 00:42:57,061
when you visualize the act,
does it relieve stress?

773
00:42:57,093 --> 00:43:00,150
Yes, father.
Yes, it does.

774
00:43:00,183 --> 00:43:05,125
Good. Then...
Continue your course.

775
00:43:07,654 --> 00:43:09,525
And, uh,
say ten Hail Marys...

776
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:11,620
and get back to me
in a month.

777
00:43:13,366 --> 00:43:16,614
My dad was a cop.
My granddad was a cop.

778
00:43:16,646 --> 00:43:18,487
My granddad's granddad
was a cop.

779
00:43:18,519 --> 00:43:20,998
Yeah. So,
genetically speaking,

780
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:23,463
We're talking
a long line...

781
00:43:23,495 --> 00:43:25,544
of very
suspicious people.

782
00:43:27,384 --> 00:43:28,759
Must be doing
something right,

783
00:43:28,792 --> 00:43:31,047
'cause the department
lifted my suspension.

784
00:43:31,081 --> 00:43:32,550
I'm working
homicide now.

785
00:43:32,583 --> 00:43:34,311
Homicide, really?

786
00:43:34,344 --> 00:43:36,408
Yeah. In fact, I was
just handed a case.

787
00:43:36,441 --> 00:43:38,968
One of your, uh,
Judge execs,

788
00:43:39,001 --> 00:43:41,319
Pierre Jejeune.

789
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:43,192
Really?

790
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:45,688
Yeah. Electrocuted
bare-ass on a copier?

791
00:43:47,242 --> 00:43:50,281
You mean
it wasn't an accident?

792
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:51,848
Well, yeah,
in the movies, maybe.

793
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,655
In real life?

794
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:57,594
You know, detective, I get the feeling
that you like to play games.

795
00:43:57,626 --> 00:44:00,008
You're a clever girl,
Sarah Jane.

796
00:44:00,042 --> 00:44:01,657
I'll give you that.

797
00:44:01,689 --> 00:44:03,274
What else will you give me?

798
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,842
A word.

799
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:07,114
Checkmate.

800
00:44:07,148 --> 00:44:09,274
I'm sorry, officer,
but checkmate...

801
00:44:09,306 --> 00:44:12,026
has two "c's" in it, not one.

802
00:44:12,059 --> 00:44:13,371
Not tonight,
doll face.

803
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:20,313
Dorothy!

804
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:27,019
<i>Day 72, 35 milligrams.</i>

805
00:44:27,052 --> 00:44:30,268
<i>Increased motivation.</i>

806
00:44:30,301 --> 00:44:32,011
<i>Decreased inhibition.</i>

807
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:34,988
He gonna be okay?

808
00:44:35,022 --> 00:44:37,052
Yeah, he does that
all the time.

809
00:44:37,085 --> 00:44:39,644
All right, 'cause
those are my slippers.

810
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,603
<i>I liked Bill,
and I think he liked me.</i>

811
00:44:42,637 --> 00:44:44,941
<i>Was he my knight
in shining armor,</i>

812
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:47,037
<i>or was he the "check"
in "checkmate"?</i>

813
00:44:47,069 --> 00:44:49,773
<i>With Jejeune's old job,
I was now at the center...</i>

814
00:44:49,806 --> 00:44:51,629
<i>of Bill's investigation,</i>

815
00:44:51,662 --> 00:44:53,933
<i>but I also had my pardon
from father Grisham.</i>

816
00:44:53,966 --> 00:44:56,590
<i>St. George, he always
had my back.</i>

817
00:44:56,622 --> 00:45:00,718
Ah! Our P.R. Princess
hath arrived!

818
00:45:00,751 --> 00:45:03,118
Sarah Jane, let me give you
the blow-by-blow...

819
00:45:03,151 --> 00:45:05,264
of the Halldice conference.

820
00:45:05,297 --> 00:45:06,558
L.J.!

821
00:45:06,592 --> 00:45:09,966
Um... A:
we go in gangbusters.

822
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:12,014
High energy.
Lightning in a bottle.

823
00:45:12,047 --> 00:45:13,822
Charmaine, B:

824
00:45:13,856 --> 00:45:16,608
Sarah Jane delivers the powerpoint
presentation and the big spiel.

825
00:45:16,641 --> 00:45:18,112
Mm-hmm, and finally C:

826
00:45:18,768 --> 00:45:20,272
If the fish are biting,
there will be...

827
00:45:20,289 --> 00:45:22,719
a perfect lull
after you're done speaking,

828
00:45:22,752 --> 00:45:26,464
At which point I want you
to say nothing, as in nada!

829
00:45:26,498 --> 00:45:28,768
Let them come to you.

830
00:45:28,801 --> 00:45:31,022
And if they don't bite?

831
00:45:31,054 --> 00:45:31,921
In that case,
there'll be...

832
00:45:31,922 --> 00:45:33,311
a much longer,
deadlier silence,

833
00:45:33,345 --> 00:45:35,200
at which point Morty...

834
00:45:35,234 --> 00:45:37,329
will hop onto his trusty steed...

835
00:45:37,362 --> 00:45:39,218
and save
fair damsel Nell...

836
00:45:39,251 --> 00:45:41,889
with such an incredible line
of horseshit...

837
00:45:41,922 --> 00:45:43,698
even Charmaine'd buy it.

838
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:45,395
Tah-dah!

839
00:45:46,739 --> 00:45:48,338
<i>Morty Wickham
had been flown in...</i>

840
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:51,236
<i>to help me get a handle
on my new job in P.R.</i>

841
00:45:51,269 --> 00:45:52,738
<i>He'd been Jejeune's protege.</i>

842
00:45:52,771 --> 00:45:54,628
<i>Morty had been passed over
for Jejeune's job...</i>

843
00:45:54,661 --> 00:45:56,898
<i>on account of
a minor drug habit.</i>

844
00:45:59,604 --> 00:46:00,484
Ooh.

845
00:46:00,517 --> 00:46:03,106
<i>I didn't have to worry
about him hitting on me.</i>

846
00:46:03,138 --> 00:46:06,165
<i>I wasn't his type.</i>

847
00:46:06,198 --> 00:46:07,475
You getting
this down?

848
00:46:07,507 --> 00:46:10,053
I'm typing as fast
as I can.

849
00:46:10,085 --> 00:46:11,875
Morty, you're the one
with the charisma.

850
00:46:12,245 --> 00:46:14,053
- You give the speech.
- Oh, nonsense.

851
00:46:14,086 --> 00:46:16,516
You're charming
and fresh-faced.

852
00:46:16,549 --> 00:46:20,326
Besides, if you need help,
I'll be right in the front row.

853
00:46:20,358 --> 00:46:24,181
Don't you sweat it, baby.
I've got your back.

854
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:27,685
<i>Every year, our company sponsored
the Halldice conference.</i>

855
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:30,630
<i>Top executives flew in
from all over the country.</i>

856
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:32,756
<i>We presented
our newest products,</i>

857
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:34,903
<i>laid out marketing strategies
for them by day,</i>

858
00:46:34,936 --> 00:46:36,661
<i>and interns by night.</i>

859
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:39,527
<i>It was my big debut
as head of P.R...</i>

860
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,430
<i>my chance to make
a good impression,</i>

861
00:46:41,462 --> 00:46:42,807
<i>to be taken seriously,</i>

862
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,424
<i>not just some
other blonde bimbo...</i>

863
00:46:44,457 --> 00:46:46,839
<i>trying to get ahead.</i>

864
00:46:50,824 --> 00:46:55,145
Judge would be the first
to promote homeopathic bandages...

865
00:46:55,177 --> 00:46:58,776
saturated with honey
instead of antibiotics,

866
00:46:58,809 --> 00:47:00,184
which would occupy
a place...

867
00:47:00,218 --> 00:47:04,458
in every medicine cabinet
in every home...

868
00:47:04,731 --> 00:47:05,849
across America.

869
00:47:14,283 --> 00:47:17,130
Honey-soaked band-aids?

870
00:47:17,162 --> 00:47:21,050
Gee, folks, sounds
kind of strange to me.

871
00:47:21,083 --> 00:47:24,603
Um, is there a problem,
Mr. Wickham?

872
00:47:24,635 --> 00:47:26,251
Yes, Miss McKinney.

873
00:47:29,804 --> 00:47:30,715
Excuse me, Sarah.

874
00:47:30,748 --> 00:47:32,875
Prescriptive antibiotics...

875
00:47:32,907 --> 00:47:35,371
are this company's
bread and butter.

876
00:47:35,405 --> 00:47:38,138
Are you really proposing
that we forsake...

877
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:40,619
our loyal doctors
and hospitals...

878
00:47:40,652 --> 00:47:44,811
for some touch-me, feel-me,
granola-inspired...

879
00:47:44,844 --> 00:47:46,892
do-it-yourself kit?

880
00:47:46,924 --> 00:47:50,668
"Gee, doc, tommy's got
a flesh-eating virus".

881
00:47:51,262 --> 00:47:52,476
"Buy a honey-soaked band-aid".

882
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:57,037
"Gee, doc, little buffy's chemo
spiked a fever".

883
00:47:57,069 --> 00:47:58,558
"Apply two honey-soaked
gauze pads...

884
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:00,365
and call me
in the morning".

885
00:48:00,398 --> 00:48:02,636
I mean, come on, people!

886
00:48:02,669 --> 00:48:04,957
Not only is this ludicrous,

887
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:06,525
it's idiotic!

888
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:10,654
I mean, what the hell
is honey anyway?

889
00:48:10,686 --> 00:48:13,343
Bee vomit!

890
00:48:13,375 --> 00:48:15,966
<i>I think St. George
would agree.</i>

891
00:48:18,608 --> 00:48:21,135
<i>Morty had not been
very chivalrous.</i>

892
00:48:56,721 --> 00:48:59,249
<i>This just in...
a tragic fire broke out...</i>

893
00:48:59,283 --> 00:49:00,689
<i>in the boroughs
this evening...</i>

894
00:49:00,724 --> 00:49:02,673
<i>when a faulty gas line
erupted.</i>

895
00:49:02,707 --> 00:49:04,178
<i>Firefighters wrestled
with that blaze...</i>

896
00:49:04,212 --> 00:49:06,931
<i>for over an hour
before getting it under control.</i>

897
00:49:06,964 --> 00:49:09,410
<i>Unfortunately, the fire
did claim the life...</i>

898
00:49:09,444 --> 00:49:12,082
<i>of the homeowner,
identified as Mortimer J. Wickham,</i>

899
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:15,028
<i>A rising executive
with Judge pharmaceuticals.</i>

900
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:16,771
<i>In other news tonight...</i>

901
00:49:16,805 --> 00:49:19,010
Hey!

902
00:49:19,044 --> 00:49:20,228
Did you guys hear that?

903
00:49:20,261 --> 00:49:22,452
News said some, uh,
exec from Judge...

904
00:49:22,483 --> 00:49:23,795
just bit the dust...
Mortimer Wickham.

905
00:49:23,829 --> 00:49:27,588
Morty? Are you kidding?

906
00:49:27,621 --> 00:49:29,092
Char and I
worked with him.

907
00:49:29,125 --> 00:49:31,155
Not anymore.
Gas leak blew him to bits.

908
00:49:31,189 --> 00:49:32,996
- That makes four.
- Four?

909
00:49:33,028 --> 00:49:35,878
Yeah, Beeber, Wilder,
Jejeune... Now Morty.

910
00:49:35,911 --> 00:49:38,612
Well, I heard that
they were all accidents.

911
00:49:38,662 --> 00:49:40,918
Four accidental deaths
in ten months?

912
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:44,021
So, what are you saying, John,
I mean, we're jinxed?

913
00:49:44,054 --> 00:49:46,613
All I'm saying is
statistically speaking...

914
00:49:46,645 --> 00:49:47,941
doesn't add up.

915
00:49:47,974 --> 00:49:50,501
Maybe we shouldn't
go back to work. I mean...

916
00:49:50,535 --> 00:49:51,750
No, no, no.

917
00:49:51,783 --> 00:49:53,125
Yours truly is
on the case.

918
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:56,007
As soon as I get a handle on this
Jejeune thing,

919
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,671
I'll know
what's what.

920
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,991
However...

921
00:50:00,024 --> 00:50:03,143
just maybe, the three of you
are gonna die...

922
00:50:03,176 --> 00:50:05,928
from dancing.
Come on, baby.

923
00:50:08,089 --> 00:50:11,590
When I was four years old,
I was scared of my own shadow.

924
00:50:11,622 --> 00:50:12,663
You were?

925
00:50:12,695 --> 00:50:14,233
Yeah, crying every day and night,

926
00:50:14,265 --> 00:50:15,384
And my old man, right,

927
00:50:15,417 --> 00:50:17,576
big porterhouse of a cop,
he says to me,

928
00:50:17,608 --> 00:50:20,153
"hey, Billy boy,
we're going to Florida,

929
00:50:20,186 --> 00:50:21,927
"and you'd better be
ready to fly.

930
00:50:21,961 --> 00:50:23,753
Any crying,
there's gonna be trouble".

931
00:50:23,786 --> 00:50:26,026
So, for six
incredibly long days,

932
00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:27,625
I was completely terrified.

933
00:50:27,658 --> 00:50:30,762
Because you were sure
you were going to cry.

934
00:50:30,795 --> 00:50:33,048
Because I didn't
know how to fly.

935
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:39,498
You know, Sarah Jane...

936
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:43,627
people aren't
who they seem to be.

937
00:50:43,659 --> 00:50:46,011
All the garbage,
all the lies...

938
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:47,787
a cop has to deal with?

939
00:50:47,819 --> 00:50:50,300
Sometimes I feel like
I'm still trying...

940
00:50:50,333 --> 00:50:52,891
to grow those wings,
rise above it all.

941
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:57,900
Bill, do you think
I'll ever fly above the clouds?

942
00:50:57,932 --> 00:50:59,884
You stick with me, kid.

943
00:50:59,917 --> 00:51:03,068
I'll fly you to the moon.

944
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:05,548
Or put you in jail.

945
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:17,181
So...

946
00:51:17,214 --> 00:51:20,189
Sarah Jane,
it was a real pleasure.

947
00:51:20,222 --> 00:51:23,101
Bill, it was
a real pleasure, too.

948
00:51:23,134 --> 00:51:27,166
All right. You sleep as snug
as a bug in a rug, okay?

949
00:51:31,518 --> 00:51:33,054
Bill.

950
00:51:33,087 --> 00:51:35,439
Listen, Sarah Jane,
I'm an old-fashioned guy,

951
00:51:35,472 --> 00:51:38,416
okay, and when the time is right,
we're both gonna know it.

952
00:51:38,448 --> 00:51:39,695
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

953
00:51:39,727 --> 00:51:40,911
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

954
00:51:40,944 --> 00:51:43,326
In the meantime,
you just keep flirting with me.

955
00:51:46,736 --> 00:51:47,776
Night.

956
00:51:47,809 --> 00:51:49,584
Good night.

957
00:51:49,616 --> 00:51:51,775
Me, I would've jumped his bones,

958
00:51:51,807 --> 00:51:53,473
Cop or no cop.

959
00:51:54,817 --> 00:51:56,128
Mom...

960
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:02,048
Oh, Mr. Ketchum!

961
00:52:02,081 --> 00:52:03,763
Uh, I'm okay.

962
00:52:03,795 --> 00:52:06,209
Oh, crap.

963
00:52:19,507 --> 00:52:21,105
Fairly serious stroke.

964
00:52:21,139 --> 00:52:23,562
We're doing everything we can.
Try not to worry.

965
00:52:23,596 --> 00:52:25,339
Worry? If it was up to me,
I'd let the old turd...

966
00:52:25,372 --> 00:52:27,203
- break his neck months ago.
- Mom!

967
00:52:27,235 --> 00:52:29,236
I can't believe he's getting by
on just his social security.

968
00:52:29,268 --> 00:52:30,963
Mom, will you
just stop it!

969
00:52:30,995 --> 00:52:32,423
When you're off
having your fancy lunches,

970
00:52:32,455 --> 00:52:34,369
- I'm home all goddamn day, boiling his,...
- That wheezing sound's quite deep.

971
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,243
- vegetables, dirty underwear, and sheets...
- See me after.

972
00:52:36,276 --> 00:52:37,716
- I'm fine, doc.
- I said see me after!

973
00:52:37,748 --> 00:52:38,850
- change his diapers?
- No fucking way!

974
00:52:38,884 --> 00:52:40,324
Mrs. Mckinney, is
this about the Bill?

975
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:42,099
The Bill? Doctor, it's 5:00
in the fucking morning.

976
00:52:42,133 --> 00:52:44,452
I got pee puddles
all over my goddamn house!

977
00:52:44,485 --> 00:52:46,804
Um, Mrs. Mckinney,
I'm working open shifts now.

978
00:52:46,836 --> 00:52:49,797
I might be able
to help you out some.

979
00:52:49,829 --> 00:52:51,301
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

980
00:52:57,239 --> 00:52:59,558
<i>It's true,
I couldn't breathe.</i>

981
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:00,615
Breathe?

982
00:53:02,214 --> 00:53:05,254
Was it because I was scared
of falling in love?

983
00:53:05,288 --> 00:53:08,069
Arms up.
Breathe.

984
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:10,231
Did I fear
being hurt again?

985
00:53:12,487 --> 00:53:14,295
Or was it because
of those...?

986
00:53:14,328 --> 00:53:15,640
Cough.

987
00:53:15,672 --> 00:53:18,118
The things I'd done.

988
00:53:19,144 --> 00:53:21,031
See, doctor,
it's nothing.

989
00:53:21,063 --> 00:53:22,647
Mm-hmm.

990
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:24,616
Tell me, have you been
anxious lately?

991
00:53:24,649 --> 00:53:25,801
Holding something in?

992
00:53:25,834 --> 00:53:27,623
I'm a little tired.

993
00:53:27,655 --> 00:53:30,376
You can put
your arms down.

994
00:53:30,408 --> 00:53:32,711
No problems in the workplace,
people stressing you out?

995
00:53:32,743 --> 00:53:34,233
Hmm-mm.

996
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:36,184
Because asthma can be
emotional in origin,

997
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:39,066
sort of
a chain reaction thing.

998
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:41,273
I'm prescribing
a new medication for you.

999
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:46,922
Foururadol.

1000
00:53:46,954 --> 00:53:48,409
But it is not...

1001
00:53:48,843 --> 00:53:50,524
and I can't emphasize
this enough...

1002
00:53:50,556 --> 00:53:53,657
it is not to be mixed
with aspirin products.

1003
00:53:54,091 --> 00:53:58,089
Gotcha. No aspirini,
no problimi.

1004
00:53:59,563 --> 00:54:02,281
Combining the two
can be lethal.

1005
00:54:05,789 --> 00:54:06,714
Huh.

1006
00:54:16,827 --> 00:54:18,635
You know, Sarah Jane,

1007
00:54:18,669 --> 00:54:22,459
All those people dying
at your work's got me thinking.

1008
00:54:22,491 --> 00:54:24,813
Yeah, Bill?
What about?

1009
00:54:26,493 --> 00:54:28,045
I mean, four execs
in ten months?

1010
00:54:28,077 --> 00:54:31,244
It's like Johnny said,
the odds of that happening...

1011
00:54:31,277 --> 00:54:33,677
I don't know if you ever
heard of some gay guy...

1012
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:35,055
being blown up
in his own house,

1013
00:54:35,088 --> 00:54:36,589
or some idiot
being electrocuted...

1014
00:54:36,622 --> 00:54:38,654
bare-ass on
a xerox machine.

1015
00:54:38,687 --> 00:54:40,575
I looked it up.

1016
00:54:40,608 --> 00:54:42,604
No one's been hit
by a train in years.

1017
00:54:46,974 --> 00:54:48,942
I mean, isn't it just
a bit coincidental...

1018
00:54:48,975 --> 00:54:51,165
that Beeber's phone records
show him text-messaging Wilder...

1019
00:54:51,198 --> 00:54:52,734
the very same night he died?

1020
00:54:52,767 --> 00:54:55,423
But you never found
Miss Wilder's cell phone, right?

1021
00:54:55,455 --> 00:54:58,720
No, actually, I did.
On the subway tracks.

1022
00:54:58,752 --> 00:55:00,336
It was all mashed up.

1023
00:55:00,368 --> 00:55:02,863
Still, the, uh, lab thinks
they can recover the chip.

1024
00:55:02,896 --> 00:55:05,041
And another thing...
death by umbrella?

1025
00:55:05,074 --> 00:55:06,606
That doesn't strike you
as strange?

1026
00:55:06,656 --> 00:55:08,687
You mean, Beeber?

1027
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,655
Hot-shot executives
just don't shish-kebab...

1028
00:55:10,688 --> 00:55:12,991
themselves on their own rain gear.
It doesn't happen.

1029
00:55:13,024 --> 00:55:14,465
Well, I don't...
I mean, maybe...

1030
00:55:14,498 --> 00:55:17,025
It's possible...
I barely knew him,

1031
00:55:17,058 --> 00:55:19,105
but I don't know,

1032
00:55:19,138 --> 00:55:21,121
maybe he just slipped
off of his ladder.

1033
00:55:21,153 --> 00:55:23,985
I never said
he had a ladder.

1034
00:55:24,019 --> 00:55:26,754
I must've heard
that at work.

1035
00:55:28,388 --> 00:55:29,442
Yeah.

1036
00:55:29,475 --> 00:55:31,073
What?

1037
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:32,929
I don't know.
You like your bouillabaisse?

1038
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:35,186
It's delicious.
How's yours?

1039
00:55:35,219 --> 00:55:36,562
Oh, fantastic.

1040
00:55:36,596 --> 00:55:38,419
<i>I'm in real trouble,
St. George.</i>

1041
00:55:39,858 --> 00:55:41,042
If Bill's onto me,

1042
00:55:41,075 --> 00:55:43,235
then I'm gonna need
to make a move.

1043
00:55:43,268 --> 00:55:45,732
But if I make a move
and in the process...

1044
00:55:45,764 --> 00:55:47,298
realize that Bill's
not onto me,

1045
00:55:47,331 --> 00:55:49,028
he might in turn
realize what's up,

1046
00:55:49,061 --> 00:55:50,834
and then he will be
onto me...

1047
00:55:50,868 --> 00:55:52,723
and I like this guy.

1048
00:55:52,757 --> 00:55:56,611
Oh, I want this guy.

1049
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:59,348
So, I guess...

1050
00:55:59,381 --> 00:56:02,196
what I'm saying is...

1051
00:56:03,446 --> 00:56:05,827
I would like
a miracle, please.

1052
00:56:05,861 --> 00:56:07,365
Now.

1053
00:56:09,589 --> 00:56:11,716
Okay, maybe not
a miracle...

1054
00:56:11,749 --> 00:56:14,470
but a sign, at least?

1055
00:56:16,471 --> 00:56:18,230
All right?

1056
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:14,986
<i>I needed a way
out of this mess,</i>

1057
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:17,609
<i>and there,
in that purifying rain,</i>

1058
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:19,434
<i>it came to me...</i>

1059
00:57:19,467 --> 00:57:21,787
<i>I needed a fresh start
with no strings...</i>

1060
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:23,724
<i>and no trail.</i>

1061
00:57:23,757 --> 00:57:26,088
<i>I needed...</i>

1062
00:57:26,121 --> 00:57:26,971
It's a win-win.

1063
00:57:26,972 --> 00:57:28,586
<i>A fall guy.</i>

1064
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:30,348
With my buddies
at Ortho Blue,

1065
00:57:30,381 --> 00:57:32,459
we manufacture,
we distribute.

1066
00:57:32,492 --> 00:57:34,988
Their logo, their liability.

1067
00:57:35,023 --> 00:57:37,435
Plus, we just put up
half the money.

1068
00:57:37,468 --> 00:57:41,132
Eh, Josh,
these test results...

1069
00:57:41,165 --> 00:57:43,789
increased heart rate,
liver complications, stroke?

1070
00:57:44,222 --> 00:57:45,677
Yeah, nobody
said it was perfect.

1071
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:47,676
Have you run this by
the Chicago office?

1072
00:57:47,709 --> 00:57:49,581
Milo Beeber did last fall.

1073
00:57:49,614 --> 00:57:51,101
Milo Beeber?

1074
00:57:51,133 --> 00:57:53,405
Yeah. It was his pet project
over at ortho.

1075
00:57:53,439 --> 00:57:55,471
He even came up
with the name.

1076
00:57:55,503 --> 00:57:58,414
You guys ready? Clarity.
Clarity.

1077
00:57:58,447 --> 00:58:01,788
And you said
it causes stroke?

1078
00:58:01,821 --> 00:58:04,799
Exactly.
The potential damage to customers is...

1079
00:58:04,832 --> 00:58:07,774
4% tops. Six, maybe five deaths
per annum...

1080
00:58:08,432 --> 00:58:10,111
- Right.
- provided they overdose.

1081
00:58:10,145 --> 00:58:11,518
And the upside?

1082
00:58:11,631 --> 00:58:13,327
Upside! Big upside!

1083
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:18,399
Salary bonuses, stock options,
promotions all around.

1084
00:58:18,432 --> 00:58:22,544
People, it's not perfect.
Nothing is.

1085
00:58:22,577 --> 00:58:25,776
I say we go for it.
Hands?

1086
00:58:32,657 --> 00:58:34,626
<i>Nether wanted Clarity?</i>

1087
00:58:34,659 --> 00:58:36,625
<i>Oh, he could have it.</i>

1088
00:58:38,194 --> 00:58:41,232
<i>Joshua Nether,
a walking, talking,</i>

1089

<i>sexual harassment
machine.</i>

1090
00:58:46,418 --> 00:58:48,547
<i>Like they said in Rome,</i>

1091
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:52,641
<i>live by the sword,
die by the sword.</i>

1092
00:58:54,035 --> 00:58:57,041
<i>Nether would never know
what hit him.</i>

1093
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:01,650
<i>I had his number...</i>

1094
00:59:02,756 --> 00:59:04,596
<i>all of his numbers.</i>

1095
00:59:04,629 --> 00:59:08,099
<i>Social security number,</i>

1096

<i>mother's birthday,

1097
00:59:12,532 --> 00:59:14,565
<i>I took the funds
he controlled for Clarity...</i>

1098
00:59:14,597 --> 00:59:17,060
<i>and transferred them
to accounts I'd created.</i>

<i>Pretending to be
his wife,</i>

1100

<i>I withdrew
all those diverted funds,</i>

1101
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:24,022
<i>And pretending

1102
00:59:24,054 --> 00:59:26,100
<i>I booked two
first-class tickets to Moldova.</i>

1103
00:59:26,132 --> 00:59:30,262
<i>Oh, FYI? Moldova has
no extradition treaty...</i>

1104
00:59:30,294 --> 00:59:32,117
<i>with the United States.
I looked it up.</i>

1105
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:40,789
Oh, that... no, no.

1106
00:59:40,822 --> 00:59:42,774
<i>This was my absolute
last date ever...</i>

1107
00:59:42,807 --> 00:59:45,429
<i>with anyone whose name
wasn't Bill Malloy.</i>

1108
00:59:45,463 --> 00:59:47,591
<i>I just prayed
that Bill would never know...</i>

1109
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:49,655
<i>what I've done
in the name of love.</i>

1110
01:00:02,376 --> 01:00:04,649
Mom, let me
call you back.

1111
01:00:04,682 --> 01:00:06,968
I'm, uh, rockin' and rollin'.

1112
01:00:08,969 --> 01:00:10,503
Home, James!

1113
01:00:10,553 --> 01:00:13,353
<i>I couldn't keep this up much longer.
Something had to give.</i>

1114
01:00:13,386 --> 01:00:15,593
Here comes the airplane
into the hangar.

1115
01:00:15,625 --> 01:00:16,905
That's right.
Big open...

1116
01:00:16,938 --> 01:00:19,496
<i>Sadly, it turned out
to be Mr. Ketchum.</i>

1117
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:22,058
Swallow 'em down, Mr. Ketchum.

1118
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:25,226
Here comes another
lovely, lovely bite.

1119
01:00:25,259 --> 01:00:28,842
Here we go. Mm!
That's a good boy.

1120
01:00:28,923 --> 01:00:31,817
Yeah, you like
my mashed peas.

1121
01:00:32,955 --> 01:00:35,403
Okay. You ready?

1122
01:00:45,965 --> 01:00:49,629
<i>Day 97.
Breathing discontinued.</i>

1123
01:00:49,661 --> 01:00:52,236
With Mr. Ketchum dead,
it was like mom...

1124
01:00:52,269 --> 01:00:53,789
was ready
for a close-up.

1125
01:00:53,821 --> 01:00:55,979
Well, it would be
her first full-fledged wake...

1126
01:00:56,013 --> 01:00:57,996
she'd thrown in years.

1127
01:00:58,028 --> 01:01:00,844
- Hey, Bill!
- Can you zip...

1128
01:01:02,029 --> 01:01:04,076
Where are you going?

1129
01:01:04,109 --> 01:01:07,868
I know what you've been
up to, Sarah Jane.

1130
01:01:07,902 --> 01:01:10,110
What? Bill!

1131
01:01:10,143 --> 01:01:13,502
Honey, these roses...
with or without the baby's breath?

1132
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:15,151
With. Bill!

1133
01:01:15,183 --> 01:01:18,542
Ah! Mr. Ketchum.

1134
01:01:18,576 --> 01:01:20,429
So, lady, where
would you like him?

1135
01:01:20,462 --> 01:01:22,205
In the parlor
by the open window.

1136
01:01:22,238 --> 01:01:23,902
<i>Bill had discovered
the truth!</i>

1137
01:01:23,935 --> 01:01:26,191
<i>My fall guy
had to fall... and fast.</i>

1138
01:01:26,528 --> 01:01:27,662
Sarah Jane, let's
do it right now!

1139
01:01:27,696 --> 01:01:28,638
- No!
- Yes!

1140
01:01:28,672 --> 01:01:29,711
- No!
- Yes!

1141
01:01:29,761 --> 01:01:31,231
Joshua, we'll
get caught.

1142
01:01:31,264 --> 01:01:32,430
No, we won't.
Now.

1143
01:01:32,463 --> 01:01:34,304
Besides, you have to go
sign those contracts.

1144
01:01:34,336 --> 01:01:35,743
- Right.
- Right?

1145
01:01:35,776 --> 01:01:37,808
Now, I gave you the address,
didn't I?

1146
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:39,121
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Right?

1147
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:41,087
And I want you...

1148
01:01:41,121 --> 01:01:42,961
To cab out there.

1149
01:01:42,994 --> 01:01:44,897
- And be there what time?
- 3:00.

1150
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:46,561
Room.
Eleven.

1151
01:01:46,593 --> 01:01:48,223
Go.

1152
01:01:49,506 --> 01:01:50,912
Go!

1153
01:01:50,945 --> 01:01:52,753
I'm going.

1154
01:01:52,786 --> 01:01:54,386
<i>Seducing a self-proclaimed
stud monkey...</i>

1155
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:56,481
<i>was far easier
than I anticipated...</i>

1156
01:01:56,514 --> 01:01:58,609
<i>and, frankly,
far more nauseating.</i>

1157
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:01,313
<i>Nether took the bait,
all right,</i>

1158
01:02:01,345 --> 01:02:02,946
<i>and was trying
to swallow it whole.</i>

1159
01:02:05,796 --> 01:02:07,266
<i>I typed Nether's confession...</i>

1160
01:02:09,107 --> 01:02:11,458
<i>forged his signature
and planted some stolen cash...</i>

1161
01:02:14,996 --> 01:02:16,194
<i>I borrowed mom's lincoln...</i>

1162
01:02:17,603 --> 01:02:20,547
<i>picked up supplies,
concocted my poison...</i>

1163
01:02:20,579 --> 01:02:23,428
<i>let's see.
50 milligrams of Clarity...</i>

1164
01:02:24,053 --> 01:02:27,044
<i>had been too much
for Mr. Ketchum...</i>

1165
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:28,756
<i>so I'd use 5,000
for Nether.</i>

1166
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:31,139
<i>You know,
it's like mom always said...</i>

1167
01:02:31,172 --> 01:02:32,790
<i>when entertaining,
better too much than too little.</i>

1168
01:02:52,022 --> 01:02:54,007
Let's rock.

1169
01:02:59,688 --> 01:03:02,469
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

1170
01:03:02,502 --> 01:03:04,615
One more.

1171
01:03:04,648 --> 01:03:07,303
Mm!

1172
01:03:07,336 --> 01:03:09,144
Joshua...

1173
01:03:09,177 --> 01:03:10,358
To us.

1174
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:12,022
To us.

1175
01:03:12,056 --> 01:03:13,368
Uh... uh... uh!

1176
01:03:19,033 --> 01:03:20,198
Drink up.

1177
01:03:20,231 --> 01:03:21,480
Mm.

1178
01:03:22,426 --> 01:03:24,649
Do you like
your oysters?

1179
01:03:24,683 --> 01:03:26,903
I love 'em.

1180
01:03:26,937 --> 01:03:28,520
Yeah?

1181
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:30,312
Do you want some more?

1182
01:03:30,345 --> 01:03:33,786
You make me want to cry.
Come here.

1183
01:03:36,363 --> 01:03:38,362
Why don't you have
another oyster?

1184
01:03:38,395 --> 01:03:40,825
Who needs the oyster
when I have the pearl?

1185
01:03:40,857 --> 01:03:42,202
Look, look, look, look.

1186
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:43,707
Open up. Open up.

1187
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:45,563
Mm.

1188
01:03:49,916 --> 01:03:52,890
Oh!

1189
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:57,899
<i>I didn't know
what would kick in first,</i>

1190
01:03:57,931 --> 01:03:59,707
<i>the oysters
or the Clarity.</i>

1191
01:04:02,316 --> 01:04:03,884
<i>It was the oysters.</i>

1192
01:04:03,917 --> 01:04:05,916
Yeah.

1193
01:04:05,948 --> 01:04:07,820
Whoa! Oh.

1194
01:04:07,853 --> 01:04:10,075
Hey, I never said
I was a virgin.

1195
01:04:10,107 --> 01:04:12,493
Ooh! Gah! Uh.

1196
01:04:26,814 --> 01:04:27,918
Ooh!

1197
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:51,999
Oh, Sarah Jane!

1198
01:04:52,032 --> 01:04:53,712
Darlin',
come here. Look.

1199
01:04:53,745 --> 01:04:55,935
You won't
believe this!

1200
01:04:55,968 --> 01:04:57,760
April Nagata,

1201
01:04:57,792 --> 01:04:59,729
Daddy's
parole officer!

1202
01:04:59,761 --> 01:05:01,664
Oh, it's nice to see you.

1203
01:05:01,696 --> 01:05:02,737
Isn't it a shame?

1204
01:05:02,769 --> 01:05:04,017
And look, Mr. Tippet!

1205
01:05:04,051 --> 01:05:05,920
Mr. Ketchum's boss
at the funeral home.

1206
01:05:05,953 --> 01:05:08,209
Finest goddamn hearse driver
that I ever had.

1207
01:05:08,241 --> 01:05:10,176
Drunk 24 hours a day...
oh, sorry, father.

1208
01:05:10,209 --> 01:05:11,344
Uh.

1209
01:05:11,377 --> 01:05:12,433
Hey.
Oh, thanks.

1210
01:05:12,465 --> 01:05:14,002
Hi, Char.
How are you?

1211
01:05:14,034 --> 01:05:16,881
Food's a class act, S.J.
Best wake this year!

1212
01:05:16,914 --> 01:05:19,297
Yeah, your mom even
busted out the champagne.

1213
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:22,546
Yeah. Okay, um,
and this is my newest friend,

1214
01:05:22,579 --> 01:05:24,019
Snooks Cunningham.

1215
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:26,403
Snooks recently underwent
a sex change operation.

1216
01:05:26,436 --> 01:05:28,275
How's long's it
been now, snooks?

1217
01:05:28,307 --> 01:05:30,401
Last Thursday.

1218
01:05:30,434 --> 01:05:33,171
So, old man Ketchum.

1219
01:05:33,205 --> 01:05:36,451
In the end, how did
the son of a bitch go down?

1220
01:05:36,483 --> 01:05:38,259
Fightin'?

1221
01:05:38,292 --> 01:05:39,796
To the last.

1222
01:05:39,828 --> 01:05:42,242
I think he used to bang
my late wife Dorothy.

1223
01:05:42,275 --> 01:05:44,021
My son's
his spitting image.

1224
01:05:44,053 --> 01:05:46,468
Really. Huh.

1225
01:05:46,501 --> 01:05:47,604
- Mom?
- Mm?

1226
01:05:47,621 --> 01:05:48,820
Uh, how's Mr. Ketchum?

1227
01:05:48,853 --> 01:05:50,596
Well, last I looked, honey,
he was still dead.

1228
01:06:38,042 --> 01:06:40,856
Um, just a minute.

1229
01:06:40,889 --> 01:06:42,537
Good day.
It's father Grisham.

1230
01:06:44,315 --> 01:06:46,344
Hi.

1231
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:47,641
I haven't seen you
at church...

1232
01:06:47,674 --> 01:06:50,425
or has your St. George
replaced me?

1233
01:06:50,457 --> 01:06:52,522
I've... I've
just been busy.

1234
01:06:53,788 --> 01:06:55,881
Killing people again?

1235
01:06:55,915 --> 01:06:59,579
You mean old Mr. Ketchum.

1236
01:06:59,612 --> 01:07:01,242
Mm.

1237
01:07:01,275 --> 01:07:04,140
Have you ever heard
of hubris, Sarah Jane?

1238
01:07:04,172 --> 01:07:07,276
Exaggerated pride
or self-confidence.

1239
01:07:07,308 --> 01:07:08,876
No.

1240
01:07:09,788 --> 01:07:11,290
You, father?

1241
01:07:12,556 --> 01:07:13,803
Mm.

1242
01:07:15,835 --> 01:07:18,620
I'll leave you
to your thoughts.

1243
01:07:29,836 --> 01:07:31,693
Bill?

1244
01:07:31,725 --> 01:07:33,614
It's over, kid.

1245
01:07:33,647 --> 01:07:34,542
End of the line.

1246
01:07:34,575 --> 01:07:36,044
You're going
to arrest me?

1247
01:07:36,077 --> 01:07:37,260
See, that's not funny.

1248
01:07:37,310 --> 01:07:39,437
Oh, I know.

1249
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:41,004
What are you doing?
What? What?

1250
01:07:41,038 --> 01:07:41,997
It's freezing.

1251
01:07:48,672 --> 01:07:50,109
You know,

1252
01:07:50,142 --> 01:07:52,815
If I hadn't seen it
with my own eyes,

1253
01:07:52,848 --> 01:07:55,134
I never would've
believed it.

1254
01:07:55,168 --> 01:07:57,552
I mean, you...
You, Sarah Jane.

1255
01:07:57,584 --> 01:07:59,472
- I mean...
- Me?

1256
01:07:59,504 --> 01:08:01,358
Don't... don't... don't
play games with me.

1257
01:08:01,391 --> 01:08:03,423
Okay? We both know
what's going on here.

1258
01:08:03,456 --> 01:08:04,927
Well, you've
gotta understand.

1259
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:07,040
The first time
it was an accident.

1260
01:08:07,072 --> 01:08:08,832
That's what you call it?

1261
01:08:08,865 --> 01:08:09,806
An accident?

1262
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,503
Yeah.

1263
01:08:11,535 --> 01:08:13,504
You got the nerve to dine uptown
with that scumbag...

1264
01:08:13,537 --> 01:08:14,625
Huh?

1265
01:08:14,793 --> 01:08:15,776
and call it an accident?

1266
01:08:15,777 --> 01:08:17,345
Which scumbag?

1267
01:08:17,378 --> 01:08:20,064
What... oh, god.
Oh, Jesus!

1268
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:24,082
Son of a bitch!

1269
01:08:24,115 --> 01:08:25,264
There are others?

1270
01:08:25,296 --> 01:08:26,884
- No. Maybe.
- Which?

1271
01:08:26,918 --> 01:08:28,261
- Who? What?
- Huh?

1272
01:08:28,293 --> 01:08:29,360
- Listen.
- What?

1273
01:08:29,361 --> 01:08:30,880
I saw you,
you understand that?

1274
01:08:30,913 --> 01:08:32,994
I saw you get out
of the car with him!

1275
01:08:33,026 --> 01:08:34,736
- Who?
- Who? Well, you know...

1276
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:37,155
one... one of your execs
on my list.

1277
01:08:37,188 --> 01:08:39,715
Uh, Nether, okay?
Last Tuesday night.

1278
01:08:41,602 --> 01:08:44,035
- Right?
- Oh.

1279
01:08:44,068 --> 01:08:46,163
So, babe, uh,
romance-wise,

1280
01:08:46,196 --> 01:08:49,155
You and me?
We're history, okay?

1281
01:08:49,188 --> 01:08:51,138
Oh, oh. Bill, wait!

1282
01:08:52,516 --> 01:08:54,772
Nether and I,
we just work together.

1283
01:08:54,804 --> 01:08:56,179
That's it.

1284
01:08:56,212 --> 01:08:58,339
It was just business,
I swear.

1285
01:08:59,764 --> 01:09:00,979
Are you lying?

1286
01:09:01,013 --> 01:09:02,516
No?

1287
01:09:02,549 --> 01:09:03,844
Really?

1288
01:09:03,877 --> 01:09:04,932
I swear.

1289
01:09:07,301 --> 01:09:08,532
Damn it!

1290
01:09:08,646 --> 01:09:09,988
Stupid temper.
Bill!

1291
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:10,869
Stupid. I just...
don't. Don't.

1292
01:09:10,901 --> 01:09:12,582
I just thought...
I know, I know.

1293
01:09:12,614 --> 01:09:14,772
But you gotta learn to trust me.

1294
01:09:18,149 --> 01:09:19,749
What's that?
What?

1295
01:09:23,735 --> 01:09:25,047
What's this?

1296
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:28,261
Uh, that's why I came in.

1297
01:09:29,544 --> 01:09:30,582
To wrap it up.

1298
01:09:30,615 --> 01:09:33,191
It's a ring. For you.

1299
01:09:33,224 --> 01:09:34,584
Hmm.

1300
01:09:35,864 --> 01:09:39,064
It's okay.
We'll get it resized.

1301
01:09:41,191 --> 01:09:43,015
Sarah Jane...

1302
01:09:43,049 --> 01:09:46,297
Do you remember when,
uh, when I told you

1303
01:09:46,329 --> 01:09:48,871
That when the time
is right, we'll know?

1304
01:09:50,825 --> 01:09:52,632
- You know what?
- What?

1305
01:09:52,665 --> 01:09:54,442
That time is right now.

1306
01:09:55,369 --> 01:09:56,840
Really?

1307
01:09:56,874 --> 01:09:59,689
Ah!

1308
01:10:01,594 --> 01:10:09,501
 'tis you, 'tis you
must go and I must bide 

1309
01:10:10,634 --> 01:10:13,338
 but come ye back 

1310
01:10:13,371 --> 01:10:16,489
 in summers
in the meadow... 

1311
01:10:16,522 --> 01:10:18,474
<i>Under the circumstances,
things were working out...</i>

1312
01:10:18,508 --> 01:10:20,538
<i>better than
I could've expected.</i>

1313
01:10:20,571 --> 01:10:22,603
<i>I had the perfect man,</i>

1314
01:10:22,636 --> 01:10:24,923
<i>the perfect job,</i>

1315
01:10:24,956 --> 01:10:27,388
<i>and with Nether
six feet under,</i>

1316
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:29,866
<i>the perfect alibi.</i>

1317
01:10:32,026 --> 01:10:34,189
"I embezzled the money
and the others found out,

1318
01:10:34,221 --> 01:10:36,603
"so I killed them one by one.
Don't try to find me.

1319
01:10:36,636 --> 01:10:40,587
I've flown off to an island
far, far away".

1320
01:10:42,174 --> 01:10:45,419
Sound like, uh,
sound like him?

1321
01:10:45,452 --> 01:10:46,588
Um...

1322
01:10:46,621 --> 01:10:48,285
Who was this?

1323
01:10:48,318 --> 01:10:49,566
Oh, Nether. Uh...

1324
01:10:49,598 --> 01:10:50,940
Yeah, that guy.

1325
01:10:50,973 --> 01:10:53,695
Could be. Could be.

1326
01:11:12,288 --> 01:11:15,151
Sarah Jane, did you hear?

1327
01:11:15,183 --> 01:11:16,880
You mean Nether?

1328
01:11:16,912 --> 01:11:19,376
Yeah. Can you believe it?

1329
01:11:19,408 --> 01:11:21,118
Maybe I was next, Bill.

1330
01:11:21,152 --> 01:11:22,896
Yeah, maybe.
Just, uh...

1331
01:11:22,929 --> 01:11:25,071
Boy, I don't know.

1332
01:11:25,088 --> 01:11:27,007
You know,
a guy that meticulous,

1333
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:29,264
you know,
a guy willing to murder...

1334
01:11:29,408 --> 01:11:30,831
in order to keep the money
he embezzled,

1335
01:11:30,864 --> 01:11:33,666
a guy like that doesn't just leave
30 grand in his office.

1336
01:11:33,699 --> 01:11:35,252
And then there's
the "L" thing.

1337
01:11:35,285 --> 01:11:36,469
The "L" thing?

1338
01:11:36,502 --> 01:11:38,330
Yeah, he spelled "sincerely"
with two "L"s,

1339
01:11:38,363 --> 01:11:40,710
you know, but when I checked
his other papers and stuff,

1340
01:11:40,742 --> 01:11:43,667
there were no mistakes,
not a one.

1341
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:44,960
Really?

1342
01:11:47,203 --> 01:11:48,978
Oh. Captain calling.
See you later?

1343
01:11:49,010 --> 01:11:50,769
You can count on it.

1344
01:11:50,802 --> 01:11:52,530
Okay, kid.

1345
01:11:52,563 --> 01:11:53,747
Captain?

1346
01:11:55,459 --> 01:11:57,091
The "L" thing.

1347
01:12:13,605 --> 01:12:17,844
<i>Who was sending the notes?</i>

1348
01:12:17,877 --> 01:12:19,554
<i>Ormsby?</i>

1349
01:12:19,588 --> 01:12:23,124
<i>My fellow asthmatic
used the same inhaler as mine.</i>

1350
01:12:25,189 --> 01:12:27,253
<i>Foururadol
was never to be mixed...</i>

1351
01:12:27,285 --> 01:12:29,701
<i>with products
containing aspirin...</i>

1352
01:12:32,071 --> 01:12:33,093
<i>like Clarity.</i>

1353
01:12:34,533 --> 01:12:37,367
<i>And since he only drank
bottled water,</i>

1354
01:12:37,399 --> 01:12:39,461
<i>he was an easy target.</i>

1355
01:12:39,494 --> 01:12:42,790
<i>Bardo. Well, it would be
the simplest thing in the world...</i>

1356
01:12:42,823 --> 01:12:45,638
<i>to set her up
as a victim of a sex crime.</i>

1357
01:12:45,670 --> 01:12:47,926
<i>In fact,
if it didn't kill her...</i>

1358
01:12:47,959 --> 01:12:50,999
<i>she would probably
enjoy it.</i>

1359
01:12:51,016 --> 01:12:53,096
<i>Mr. Everwright.
Now, let's be real.</i>

1360
01:12:53,128 --> 01:12:55,255
<i>He was a few clowns
short of a circus.</i>

1361
01:12:55,288 --> 01:12:57,176
<i>No way it was him.</i>

1362
01:12:57,209 --> 01:12:58,808
<i>Father Grisham.</i>

1363
01:12:58,841 --> 01:13:00,471
<i>I'd actually confessed
to father Grisham.</i>

1364
01:13:00,503 --> 01:13:04,265
<i>But it turned out
he was no saint himself.</i>

1365
01:13:06,392 --> 01:13:09,256
<i>And Bill was getting
closer to the truth.</i>

1366
01:13:09,288 --> 01:13:11,641
<i>The noose
was starting to tighten.</i>

1367
01:13:11,673 --> 01:13:14,249
But you said
he left the country.

1368
01:13:14,299 --> 01:13:16,057
Yeah, but maybe he didn't.
Policeman's ball.

1369
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:17,128
Policeman's ball.

1370
01:13:17,178 --> 01:13:18,841
I got him boarding
a plane to Jamaica,

1371
01:13:18,873 --> 01:13:20,121
right, but he never gets off.

1372
01:13:20,154 --> 01:13:22,506
What if he just wants us
to think he split, huh?

1373
01:13:22,538 --> 01:13:23,850
Policeman's ball.

1374
01:13:23,883 --> 01:13:25,737
So, you think
he's still in town?

1375
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:26,921
Yeah, he could be.

1376
01:13:26,953 --> 01:13:28,617
I tracked him down
to a hotel...

1377
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:30,682
the day he supposedly
got out of dodge, right?

1378
01:13:30,714 --> 01:13:33,019
Seems he diddled a chick
in that room first.

1379
01:13:33,051 --> 01:13:34,154
Policeman's ball.
A motel?

1380
01:13:34,188 --> 01:13:36,186
No, hotel. 11:00 am.
Downtown Marriott.

1381
01:13:36,219 --> 01:13:38,121
I didn't get a fix
on the girlfriend,

1382
01:13:38,155 --> 01:13:40,074
But Nether was definitely there.
Policeman's ball.

1383
01:13:40,106 --> 01:13:43,020
Oh, god, then he did me
later that afternoon.

1384
01:13:43,052 --> 01:13:44,892
Policeman's ball.

1385
01:13:46,013 --> 01:13:47,980
Pretzel
for the lady, please.

1386
01:13:48,013 --> 01:13:49,450
Thanks.

1387
01:13:49,499 --> 01:13:51,610
Still, the best part
of my theory?

1388
01:13:51,644 --> 01:13:53,260
I'll bite. Is what?

1389
01:13:53,293 --> 01:13:55,115
Nether always wore
his cell phone, right?

1390
01:13:55,148 --> 01:13:56,732
Never went anywhere
without it.

1391
01:13:56,764 --> 01:13:58,588
I'm not sure
I follow.

1392
01:13:58,621 --> 01:14:00,939
Well, see, if we track down
his cell phone,

1393
01:14:00,971 --> 01:14:03,470
we can send silent messages
for up to 96 hours, right?

1394
01:14:03,502 --> 01:14:05,438
You locate the frequency,
you locate the cell phone.

1395
01:14:05,471 --> 01:14:07,630
You locate the cell phone,
you locate Nether.

1396
01:14:07,662 --> 01:14:09,693
Connect the cell phone
to Wilder's,

1397
01:14:09,726 --> 01:14:11,646
you've got
yourself a case...

1398
01:14:11,678 --> 01:14:12,991
In theory, anyway.

1399
01:14:13,024 --> 01:14:14,861
Come on, sweet knees.

1400
01:14:14,895 --> 01:14:16,989
<i>I had to dig up
Mr. Ketchum's coffin...</i>

1401
01:14:17,022 --> 01:14:19,149
<i>and find that cell phone
before Bill did,</i>

1402
01:14:19,183 --> 01:14:21,213
<i>and I needed that cash
I'd hidden inside...</i>

1403
01:14:21,246 --> 01:14:22,783
<i>to pay off my blackmailer.</i>

1404
01:14:36,785 --> 01:14:39,936
And to think, management thought
you were smarter than me.

1405
01:14:39,968 --> 01:14:42,417
Charmaine?
W... what are you do...?

1406
01:14:42,449 --> 01:14:45,039
Payback for stealing
my promotion.

1407
01:14:49,361 --> 01:14:51,280
You're my blackmailer!

1408
01:14:51,313 --> 01:14:53,874
Ooh.
What are you...?

1409
01:14:53,907 --> 01:14:56,225
I'm the one who started you off
on your little crime spree.

1410
01:14:56,257 --> 01:14:58,449
Oh, you...
Followed me here?

1411
01:14:58,482 --> 01:15:00,913
I told Beeber
you were an easy lay.

1412
01:15:02,419 --> 01:15:05,344
But I'm not...
I said shut up!

1413
01:15:05,378 --> 01:15:08,579
I also clued in Miss Wilder.

1414
01:15:08,611 --> 01:15:09,824
And Morty, too?

1415
01:15:09,858 --> 01:15:12,931
Yeah, sure, I teed up Morty.
Why not?

1416
01:15:12,964 --> 01:15:15,986
What I didn't count on was that
you would actually start enjoying yourself.

1417
01:15:18,677 --> 01:15:21,314
No, no, but Jejeune!
Jejeune... Jejeune was my idea.

1418
01:15:21,347 --> 01:15:23,475
Oh, please, you
stupid little bitch.

1419
01:15:23,509 --> 01:15:26,820
<i>I'm the one who sent
the fax of you and Wilder.</i>

1420
01:15:28,902 --> 01:15:29,827
Not that jerk!

1421
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:32,181
I even had Johnny
blab to a few cops...

1422
01:15:32,213 --> 01:15:34,564
that your mom
had a room to let.

1423
01:15:34,836 --> 01:15:35,956
Figuring what,
that a cop...

1424
01:15:35,989 --> 01:15:38,148
would pick up on...
on all those deaths...

1425
01:15:38,182 --> 01:15:39,428
at work.

1426
01:15:39,461 --> 01:15:41,204
Yeah, and zero in
on you.

1427
01:15:41,237 --> 01:15:42,769
- That's good.
- Yeah.

1428
01:15:42,802 --> 01:15:44,149
and you making Nether
the fall guy?

1429
01:15:44,183 --> 01:15:46,438
I mean, that was just...
that was just a bonus.

1430
01:15:46,912 --> 01:15:50,157
Now instead of just revenge,
there was money to be had.

1431
01:15:50,791 --> 01:15:53,383
I would like that money,
Sarah Jane.

1432
01:15:53,417 --> 01:15:54,388
Now!

1433
01:15:54,421 --> 01:15:56,085
Fine.

1434
01:15:57,639 --> 01:15:59,365
You're a bitch!

1435
01:15:59,398 --> 01:16:00,901
What?

1436
01:16:28,216 --> 01:16:31,192
Get me the money!

1437
01:16:33,162 --> 01:16:34,344
Aah!

1438
01:16:39,802 --> 01:16:43,323
There! That blackmail note
on the window.

1439
01:16:43,355 --> 01:16:45,513
Did you like my printing?

1440
01:16:45,547 --> 01:16:47,641
Remember when
your dad died...

1441
01:16:47,674 --> 01:16:49,528
for beating up
your mom?

1442
01:16:49,562 --> 01:16:51,930
I do.

1443
01:16:51,963 --> 01:16:53,163
Your mom said
Daddy Boozehound...

1444
01:16:53,195 --> 01:16:54,602
had a head-on
with a cement truck,

1445
01:16:54,635 --> 01:16:55,722
But you said
you knew different.

1446
01:16:56,125 --> 01:16:57,739
You said it was
your guardian angel,

1447
01:16:57,771 --> 01:16:59,818
St. George, that he'd
come to save you.

1448
01:16:59,851 --> 01:17:03,291
Well, hon, where's
your guardian angel now? Huh?

1449
01:17:22,927 --> 01:17:25,582
Hey, Sare!

1450
01:17:25,615 --> 01:17:28,094
Where's your saint now?

1451
01:17:54,464 --> 01:17:55,521
Hey, Char!

1452
01:17:57,762 --> 01:17:59,487
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

1453
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:03,297
Aaah!

1454
01:18:22,532 --> 01:18:24,514
Yes, uh, we did recover
a cell phone...

1455
01:18:24,546 --> 01:18:25,921
we believed to be
Miss Wilder's.

1456
01:18:25,954 --> 01:18:27,985
As it turns out,
it was another commuter's.

1457
01:18:28,019 --> 01:18:30,338
Had Charmaine Abatemarco
been having an affair with Nether?

1458
01:18:30,370 --> 01:18:32,963
Well, uh, we did trace them
to a certain motel,

1459
01:18:32,996 --> 01:18:34,994
so that seems to be
the case, yes.

1460
01:18:35,027 --> 01:18:37,283
And then, what, they argued
over her share of the embezzled money?

1461
01:18:37,316 --> 01:18:39,075
That is a scenario
that we're pursuing,

1462
01:18:39,107 --> 01:18:40,642
that Miss Abatemarco
killed Mr. Nether,

1463
01:18:40,675 --> 01:18:43,332
hid him and the money
inside the coffin,

1464
01:18:43,365 --> 01:18:45,012
returned later
to dig it up,

1465
01:18:45,044 --> 01:18:47,569
and Either somehow slipped
or jumped from the belfry.

1466
01:18:47,570 --> 01:18:48,469
Uh, detective.

1467
01:18:48,502 --> 01:18:50,195
Uh, your name.

1468
01:18:50,212 --> 01:18:53,461
Is that with one "L"
or with two?

1469
01:18:55,989 --> 01:18:57,981
M/A/L/L/O/Y.

1470
01:18:59,446 --> 01:19:01,589
<i>On the home front,
mom finally got around...</i>

1471
01:19:01,623 --> 01:19:04,133
<i>to cleaning out
Mr. Ketchum's belongings.</i>

1472
01:19:09,429 --> 01:19:11,333
<i>It turns out she was right...</i>

1473
01:19:11,367 --> 01:19:13,719
<i>about Mr. Ketchum having
a secret stash.</i>

1474
01:19:18,376 --> 01:19:21,880
<i>Her thrift shop days
were over.</i>

1475
01:19:21,912 --> 01:19:24,007
Whoo! Whoo!

1476
01:19:24,039 --> 01:19:26,759
<i>And in a surprising twist,
a change of management...</i>

1477
01:19:26,791 --> 01:19:28,982
<i>not precipitated
by my gentle touch,</i>

1478
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:31,414
<i>Mr. Everwright
just plain old retired,</i>

1479
01:19:31,448 --> 01:19:34,519
<i>and the board rewarded
Mr. Ormsby for years of...</i>

1480
01:19:34,551 --> 01:19:37,881
<i>Well, just for years.</i>

1481
01:19:39,895 --> 01:19:41,303
<i>And I inherited...</i>

1482
01:19:41,336 --> 01:19:43,241
<i>not only Ormsby's
plum marketing job,</i>

1483
01:19:43,275 --> 01:19:45,096
<i>but also his
very cool corner office.</i>

1484
01:19:45,129 --> 01:19:47,096
Are you taking
a smoke break out there?

1485
01:19:47,130 --> 01:19:48,504
Let's go.

1486
01:19:48,537 --> 01:19:49,576
Thank you.

1487
01:19:51,130 --> 01:19:53,417
You know, I'm not loving that.
Not loving it.

1488
01:19:53,450 --> 01:19:55,641
Let's try it back over
on the other side.

1489
01:19:55,673 --> 01:19:58,586
That's what you guys get for
slacking, you know what I mean?

1490
01:20:01,003 --> 01:20:03,131
<i>Things were perfect.</i>

1491
01:20:03,165 --> 01:20:05,289
That's good.
That's good.

1492
01:20:05,322 --> 01:20:06,859
You guys like the dog here?

1493
01:20:06,891 --> 01:20:07,817
<i>But then...</i>

1494
01:20:07,851 --> 01:20:08,921
I do.

1495
01:20:08,954 --> 01:20:10,106
<i>Bill called.</i>

1496
01:20:13,773 --> 01:20:16,811
You know, Sarah Jane,
I've been thinkin'.

1497
01:20:16,844 --> 01:20:19,162
Yeah, Bill?
What about?

1498
01:20:19,179 --> 01:20:20,811
About that ring
you gave me.

1499
01:20:22,796 --> 01:20:25,484
I feel like I've, uh,
seen it somewhere before.

1500
01:20:25,517 --> 01:20:27,229
Really.

1501
01:20:27,261 --> 01:20:32,188
In the, uh, store window
next to this one.

1502
01:20:34,253 --> 01:20:35,805
Oh!

1503
01:20:37,789 --> 01:20:39,373
Come here, kid.

1504
01:20:51,167 --> 01:20:52,912
<i>St. George, Patron Saint
of chivalry...</i>

1505
01:20:52,944 --> 01:20:55,293
<i>and major dragon slayer,
had come through for me again.</i>

1506
01:20:55,326 --> 01:20:57,517
<i>I was a successful executive,</i>

1507
01:20:57,551 --> 01:20:59,117
<i>and I had my knight
in shining armor,</i>

1508
01:20:59,150 --> 01:21:00,750
<i>But not without a price.</i>

1509
01:21:00,784 --> 01:21:03,006
<i>So, I tried to compensate
where I could,</i>

1510
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:04,959
<i>atone for my sins.</i>

1511
01:21:04,991 --> 01:21:06,016
Oh, hey!
Hey hey hey hey!

1512
01:21:06,049 --> 01:21:08,224
Coffee's ready and, uh,
you have three calls.

1513
01:21:08,257 --> 01:21:09,519
Good morning,
by the way.

1514
01:21:09,551 --> 01:21:11,728
Later.
And, L.J. just water.

1515
01:21:11,761 --> 01:21:15,297
<i>I decided to recommend
L.J. Feffer for a promotion...</i>

1516
01:21:15,330 --> 01:21:17,120
<i>to give him the opportunity
I'd had,</i>

1517
01:21:17,154 --> 01:21:18,720
<i>but without
all the dirty deeds.</i>

1518
01:21:19,025 --> 01:21:21,231
<i>It was the least I could do
for St. George.</i>

1519
01:21:21,265 --> 01:21:23,649
<i>Dear Mr. Ormsby...</i>

1520
01:21:23,682 --> 01:21:26,463
<i>my time
at Judge pharmaceuticals...</i>

1521
01:21:26,497 --> 01:21:28,689
<i>has been the most rewarding
experience of my life.</i>

1522
01:21:28,723 --> 01:21:31,281
<i>This company has offered me
the unexpected opportunity...</i>

1523
01:21:31,314 --> 01:21:33,953
<i>to work my way up
the corporate ladder.</i>

1524
01:21:33,986 --> 01:21:36,994
<i>On that note, I would like
to recommend a bright young man...</i>

1525
01:21:37,026 --> 01:21:39,121
<i>for our new entry-level
executive position,</i>

1526
01:21:39,154 --> 01:21:41,346
<i>my assistant, L.J. Feffer.</i>

1527
01:21:41,379 --> 01:21:42,884
Thank you.

1528
01:21:42,916 --> 01:21:44,099
Ooh.

1529
01:21:44,131 --> 01:21:45,634
Mm!

1530
01:21:45,667 --> 01:21:48,083
- L.J.
- Yeah?

1531
01:21:48,116 --> 01:21:51,955
I wanted to say that I think
you're doing a terrific job.

1532
01:21:53,590 --> 01:21:55,779
Oh, the, uh...

1533
01:21:55,812 --> 01:21:57,379
You were out
of water bottles,

1534
01:21:57,412 --> 01:21:59,700
So... I just stole...

1535
01:21:59,733 --> 01:22:02,452
one of Ormsby's
from the kitchen.

1536
01:22:02,661 --> 01:22:05,156
Forward thinking.
I like that.

1537
01:22:10,149 --> 01:22:11,556
<i>Though at first glance,</i>

1538
01:22:11,589 --> 01:22:14,452
<i>L.J. Might seem more
expendable...</i>

1539
01:22:18,519 --> 01:22:19,653
Hey, L.J.!

1540
01:22:19,670 --> 01:22:21,108
Yeah?

1541
01:22:21,141 --> 01:22:25,285
"Expendable". Does that have
an "a" in it, or an "I"?

1542
01:22:25,317 --> 01:22:27,910
Um... Hold on.

1543
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:29,750
Just looking
it up.

1544
01:22:29,782 --> 01:22:34,663
"Expendable. Used up
or consumed in service".

1545
01:22:34,695 --> 01:22:39,190
- Uh, E-X-P-E-N-D-A-B-L-E.
- Okay. Oh, oh, wait. Hold on.

1546
01:22:39,275 --> 01:22:41,543
Wait a second.
What was that again?

1547
01:22:41,577 --> 01:22:44,806
- E/X.
- E/X.

1548
01:22:44,839 --> 01:22:46,159
P/E.

1549
01:22:46,192 --> 01:22:47,200
P...

1550
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,146
"X".

1551
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:56,937
L.J.?

1552
01:22:56,970 --> 01:22:58,569
Yeah.

1553
01:22:58,602 --> 01:23:01,416
That water that you got
from Mr. Ormsby's water jug.

1554
01:23:04,009 --> 01:23:07,177
It didn't, by chance, have
an "x" marked on the top?

1555
01:23:16,027 --> 01:23:19,336
<i>Would I do things differently,
knowing what I know now?</i>

1556
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:22,219
<i>Would St. George
not have killed the dragon?</i>

1557
01:23:22,253 --> 01:23:24,665
<i>I'd never be a saint,</i>

1558
01:23:24,698 --> 01:23:26,538
<i>but we can't start over.</i>

1559
01:23:26,572 --> 01:23:28,522
<i>There is no past.</i>

1560
01:23:28,556 --> 01:23:30,393
<i>There is no future.</i>

1561
01:23:30,427 --> 01:23:32,364
<i>We only have now.</i>

1562
01:23:32,397 --> 01:23:36,090
<i>The rest, like mom
always said, is karma.</i>

1563
01:23:36,124 --> 01:23:38,445
<i>We get what we deserve.</i>

1564
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,059
