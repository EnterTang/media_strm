1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,562
(Singing) And you need
some love and care,

2
00:00:34,638 --> 00:00:37,163
And nothing,

3
00:00:37,241 --> 00:00:42,201
nothing is going right,

4
00:00:42,279 --> 00:00:44,406
Close your eyes,

5
00:00:44,481 --> 00:00:46,779
and think of me,

6
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:51,446
And soon I will be there,

7
00:00:51,522 --> 00:00:53,922
to Brighten up,

8
00:00:53,991 --> 00:00:57,791
even your darkest night,

9
00:00:57,861 --> 00:01:02,059
Winter, spring,
summer or fall,

10
00:01:02,132 --> 00:01:05,795
All you have to do is call,

11
00:01:21,819 --> 00:01:23,878
What the hell
are you doing here?

12
00:01:38,936 --> 00:01:42,235
Is this it?

13
00:01:42,306 --> 00:01:43,136
Thanks for bringing me.

14
00:01:43,207 --> 00:01:44,231
I had to come
to London anyway.

15
00:01:44,308 --> 00:01:45,070
It's worth the detour

16
00:01:45,142 --> 00:01:47,906
to make sure you're not
still hanging around.

17
00:01:47,978 --> 00:01:49,172
Now get out.

18
00:01:49,246 --> 00:01:50,178
I'm sorry,

19
00:01:50,247 --> 00:01:51,145
I just needed to see you.

20
00:01:51,215 --> 00:01:54,742
You needed money, that's all!

21
00:01:54,818 --> 00:01:55,978
Well you won't
make me pay any more.

22
00:01:56,053 --> 00:01:57,884
Never again.

23
00:02:06,096 --> 00:02:08,394
You're scum,
Jane, that's all.

24
00:02:08,465 --> 00:02:09,523
I don't want to know you.

25
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,294
No one does.

26
00:02:10,367 --> 00:02:12,096
Sooner or later
everyone's just going to
think you're dead anyway.

27
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:13,431
It would be
better if you were!

28
00:02:13,504 --> 00:02:15,131
Now piss off!

29
00:02:28,452 --> 00:02:29,578
Are you all right?

30
00:02:31,121 --> 00:02:33,681
It was just a row, you know.

31
00:02:33,757 --> 00:02:35,782
I thought he was
going to hurt you.

32
00:03:07,658 --> 00:03:09,455
(Doorbell)

33
00:03:09,526 --> 00:03:10,458
More and more bills.

34
00:03:10,527 --> 00:03:11,789
(Doorbell)

35
00:03:15,465 --> 00:03:16,363
Yes, who is it?

36
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:17,764
I'm round the back.

37
00:03:23,207 --> 00:03:24,538
Oh, it's you George, is it?

38
00:03:24,608 --> 00:03:25,905
I thought it was the
bloke they send round

39
00:03:25,976 --> 00:03:27,443
to test the front door bells.

40
00:03:27,511 --> 00:03:28,705
We've got a body.

41
00:03:28,779 --> 00:03:29,803
I've been trying to ring you.

42
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,050
my phone is not off.

43
00:03:34,117 --> 00:03:35,141
It's never off.

44
00:03:36,954 --> 00:03:39,718
My phone's off,
where's your mobile?

45
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,381
Yeah.

46
00:03:40,457 --> 00:03:42,755
Let's see.

47
00:03:42,826 --> 00:03:45,226
Ridiculous this is.

48
00:03:45,295 --> 00:03:46,785
I've been filling in forms

49
00:03:46,863 --> 00:03:48,023
so I can get cheap calls

50
00:03:48,098 --> 00:03:50,362
on the numbers I use the most.

51
00:03:50,434 --> 00:03:54,393
Oh, yeah, Indian takeaway
was top of the list.

52
00:03:54,471 --> 00:03:56,132
Quickly followed
by the Chinese.

53
00:03:56,206 --> 00:03:58,197
Oh yeah, they've got
all that on the computer.

54
00:03:58,275 --> 00:03:59,207
Yeah, that's fine.

55
00:03:59,276 --> 00:04:01,608
When it actually comes to
giving you a phone that works,

56
00:04:01,678 --> 00:04:03,543
oh no that's... Hello?

57
00:04:03,614 --> 00:04:07,050
Yes, I want to report a
phone that's out of order.

58
00:04:07,117 --> 00:04:07,981
Yes.

59
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:11,418
Denton 764323.

60
00:04:11,488 --> 00:04:13,080
And it would be very
helpful, you know,

61
00:04:13,156 --> 00:04:14,418
if you're going
to disconnect people

62
00:04:14,491 --> 00:04:17,551
you inform them
first so that...

63
00:04:17,628 --> 00:04:18,959
What?

64
00:04:21,932 --> 00:04:23,422
I see.

65
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,967
All right.

66
00:04:25,035 --> 00:04:28,493
Yes, yes, I'll see
to it, thank you.

67
00:04:28,572 --> 00:04:30,164
All sorted Jack?

68
00:04:32,976 --> 00:04:34,671
Where's that ruddy bill?

69
00:05:08,045 --> 00:05:09,205
Good day, Inspector.

70
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,246
Yes, good day.

71
00:05:10,314 --> 00:05:12,339
Life extinct early
hours of this morning.

72
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,941
Sometime between
midnight and two a.m.

73
00:05:15,018 --> 00:05:16,212
How old is she?

74
00:05:16,286 --> 00:05:18,481
Between fifteen and sixteen.

75
00:05:18,555 --> 00:05:19,954
Cause of death?

76
00:05:20,023 --> 00:05:22,184
I'm pretty sure the post
mortem will show drowning.

77
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:25,251
But you'll notice

78
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:28,196
some recent bruising
around the neck.

79
00:05:28,265 --> 00:05:31,894
That needs to be
examined in more detail.

80
00:05:31,968 --> 00:05:36,098
I thought you should
have a look, at least.

81
00:05:36,173 --> 00:05:39,040
Any means of identification?

82
00:05:39,109 --> 00:05:41,543
I gather not.

83
00:05:41,611 --> 00:05:44,705
All too predictable if
she's been living rough.

84
00:05:44,781 --> 00:05:48,308
No bills, no credit
card, no check book.

85
00:05:48,385 --> 00:05:49,443
None of the stuff of life

86
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,353
which is so indispensable
to most of us.

87
00:05:53,423 --> 00:05:55,118
What about needle marks?

88
00:05:55,192 --> 00:05:57,285
There are no obvious
signs of drugs abuse.

89
00:05:57,361 --> 00:05:59,420
Are you sure?

90
00:05:59,496 --> 00:06:02,363
It's a grim statement of
where we are, Inspector.

91
00:06:02,432 --> 00:06:04,992
I'm called out to the dead
body of a teenage girl,

92
00:06:05,068 --> 00:06:06,535
and like you,

93
00:06:06,603 --> 00:06:07,865
my first thought

94
00:06:07,938 --> 00:06:10,463
is to look for signs
of heroin addiction.

95
00:06:27,124 --> 00:06:28,648
He's back again.

96
00:06:45,575 --> 00:06:47,475
Sorry Mr. Barber.

97
00:06:47,544 --> 00:06:50,741
Didn't know you were
inspecting us again.

98
00:07:12,903 --> 00:07:14,564
Slight problem, Mr. Ryan.

99
00:07:14,638 --> 00:07:16,128
I know, I've got a
pile of forms upstairs

100
00:07:16,206 --> 00:07:17,002
for the Min of Ag.

101
00:07:17,073 --> 00:07:17,903
I'll sign them today.

102
00:07:17,974 --> 00:07:20,534
No it's that Environmental
Health Officer,

103
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,770
he's wandering round again.

104
00:07:21,845 --> 00:07:23,335
I'll call you back.

105
00:07:23,413 --> 00:07:24,311
What does he want now?

106
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:25,075
I don't know.

107
00:07:25,148 --> 00:07:25,944
He just turned up.

108
00:07:26,016 --> 00:07:27,381
He's obsessed!

109
00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:35,122
Mr. Barber, I'd appreciate
it if you'd inform me

110
00:07:35,192 --> 00:07:36,659
when you arrive
on my premises.

111
00:07:36,726 --> 00:07:38,023
I might be able to help you,

112
00:07:38,094 --> 00:07:39,959
besides the issue of safety.

113
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,190
I'm following
up some complaints

114
00:07:41,264 --> 00:07:42,356
from local residents.

115
00:07:42,432 --> 00:07:44,059
Incinerator dust
on their cars again?

116
00:07:44,134 --> 00:07:46,295
Or is it unpleasant
odors this time?

117
00:07:46,369 --> 00:07:48,701
There may still be a problem
with your incinerator.

118
00:07:48,772 --> 00:07:51,639
I've had that incinerator
serviced twice this year.

119
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:52,640
And what's it got to do

120
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:54,199
with you roaming about
the operation anyway?

121
00:07:54,277 --> 00:07:55,869
Just doing my job.

122
00:07:55,946 --> 00:07:57,379
No you're not.

123
00:07:57,447 --> 00:07:59,881
I've a Meat Hygiene Service
inspector here full time.

124
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,714
If you want any information
about this area, ask him,

125
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:03,616
right, Dave?

126
00:08:03,687 --> 00:08:06,212
I've got nothing relevant
to the Environmental Health,

127
00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:07,586
I've been back for
the figures on your

128
00:08:07,657 --> 00:08:08,851
(Unintelligible)
of meat twice now.

129
00:08:08,925 --> 00:08:10,586
Get off my back

130
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,628
or I'll push you off.

131
00:08:14,164 --> 00:08:15,563
You're wasting
your time on this.

132
00:08:15,632 --> 00:08:17,395
And you've been here too long.

133
00:08:17,467 --> 00:08:18,661
What's that supposed to mean?

134
00:08:18,735 --> 00:08:20,726
I don't have to keep
my head down, do I?

135
00:08:20,804 --> 00:08:22,066
You wouldn't be the
first Meat Inspector

136
00:08:22,138 --> 00:08:23,264
to look the other way.

137
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,207
Look, the meat trade's
had a rough time lately,

138
00:08:26,276 --> 00:08:27,300
and blokes who work here

139
00:08:27,377 --> 00:08:29,311
don't like anyone
who's sniffing around,

140
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:31,677
especially someone
who's just out for trouble.

141
00:08:31,748 --> 00:08:33,739
They think their jobs
might be on the line.

142
00:08:33,817 --> 00:08:35,284
They get very
stroppy about it.

143
00:08:35,352 --> 00:08:37,252
You'd better
watch yourself, Barber.

144
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,844
The more I get threatened,

145
00:08:38,922 --> 00:08:42,323
the more I think
I should look harder.

146
00:08:42,392 --> 00:08:44,622
Come on, there's
no need for all this.

147
00:08:44,694 --> 00:08:45,956
There were
problems last year,

148
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:48,122
but Ryan's put money
into new equipment,

149
00:08:48,198 --> 00:08:49,722
a lot of money.

150
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,232
No one's covering
anything up here,

151
00:08:51,301 --> 00:08:52,996
believe me.

152
00:09:02,112 --> 00:09:04,307
You'll want to do
something about that car.

153
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:07,179
That's a real
environmental health risk.

154
00:09:29,105 --> 00:09:31,403
George, give me one of
those photos, will you?

155
00:09:45,689 --> 00:09:47,748
Spare a bit of change please.

156
00:09:47,824 --> 00:09:49,348
There you go.

157
00:09:49,426 --> 00:09:50,484
Thanks.

158
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,118
That's all right.

159
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:56,390
Have you seen this girl?

160
00:09:56,466 --> 00:09:58,195
No.

161
00:09:58,268 --> 00:10:01,032
You don't know her?

162
00:10:01,104 --> 00:10:02,867
You're a pig, right?

163
00:10:02,939 --> 00:10:05,601
You got nothing better
to do than to bust me?

164
00:10:05,675 --> 00:10:08,872
She was living
rough in Denton.

165
00:10:08,945 --> 00:10:10,572
Now she's dead.

166
00:10:10,647 --> 00:10:12,274
I can see that.

167
00:10:14,551 --> 00:10:16,815
I'm trying to find
out who she was

168
00:10:16,886 --> 00:10:19,980
and what happened to her.

169
00:10:20,056 --> 00:10:23,219
If she's dead,
it doesn't matter.

170
00:10:23,293 --> 00:10:25,761
Spare a bit of change please.

171
00:10:28,598 --> 00:10:30,589
There's nothing
you can do, Warren.

172
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:33,465
They definitely don't want
me looking round the place.

173
00:10:33,536 --> 00:10:35,902
They're hiding something.

174
00:10:35,972 --> 00:10:37,166
If I am going to
find out what it is,

175
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,605
I need to get
in there at night,

176
00:10:38,675 --> 00:10:40,040
when there's no one around.

177
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:44,342
Don't you think you're taking
this a bit too personally?

178
00:10:44,414 --> 00:10:47,440
That's no good reason to
let them get away with it?

179
00:10:47,517 --> 00:10:49,883
And anyway,

180
00:10:49,953 --> 00:10:52,547
there are better things
we can do at night.

181
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:58,320
Just a kid.

182
00:10:58,395 --> 00:10:59,123
Yeah.

183
00:10:59,195 --> 00:11:00,822
We've got no ID

184
00:11:00,897 --> 00:11:02,524
but if she's been
reported missing

185
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:04,931
she'd be on the
National Register somewhere.

186
00:11:05,001 --> 00:11:05,990
I imagine you notice

187
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:07,832
if your fifteen-year-old
daughter goes missing.

188
00:11:07,904 --> 00:11:09,337
I mean, who knows?

189
00:11:09,406 --> 00:11:10,600
She's been living
on the streets

190
00:11:10,674 --> 00:11:12,369
for the last few months.

191
00:11:12,442 --> 00:11:13,340
Anyway, there's the rest.

192
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,139
Ah, Jack, good.

193
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:18,112
Preliminary autopsy results.

194
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:19,546
Jack?

195
00:11:19,616 --> 00:11:20,310
Sir, yeah?

196
00:11:20,383 --> 00:11:21,782
Hold it.

197
00:11:23,086 --> 00:11:24,553
We seem to have
a bit of a problem

198
00:11:24,621 --> 00:11:26,486
on the communication front.

199
00:11:26,556 --> 00:11:28,251
Ah, well then you'll
want the CAD room, sir,

200
00:11:28,324 --> 00:11:30,224
that's where all
the communicating
is done round here.

201
00:11:30,293 --> 00:11:31,260
Very hi-tech it is.

202
00:11:31,327 --> 00:11:33,761
I'm referring to the fact
your phone is out of order.

203
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,593
A number of people have
been trying to contact you,

204
00:11:35,665 --> 00:11:36,757
myself included.

205
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:39,233
Well, that's because there's
been an engineering fault.

206
00:11:39,302 --> 00:11:41,429
My information is
that it's been cut off.

207
00:11:41,504 --> 00:11:42,528
Because...

208
00:11:42,605 --> 00:11:45,540
Excuse me, sir.

209
00:11:45,608 --> 00:11:48,543
Because the bill
hasn't been paid.

210
00:11:48,611 --> 00:11:49,839
Now what sort of
example do you think

211
00:11:49,913 --> 00:11:50,880
it sets the rest of society

212
00:11:50,947 --> 00:11:53,279
when senior police officers
who can't pay their bills

213
00:11:53,349 --> 00:11:55,613
have to have their
facilities cut off?

214
00:11:55,685 --> 00:11:57,118
That could be
rather painful, sir,

215
00:11:57,187 --> 00:11:58,484
when you think about it.

216
00:11:58,555 --> 00:12:00,887
Just, just sort
it out, will you?

217
00:12:00,957 --> 00:12:02,185
Sir.

218
00:12:05,595 --> 00:12:06,527
How did he know?

219
00:12:06,596 --> 00:12:07,756
How did he find out?

220
00:12:07,831 --> 00:12:08,889
Now give me my coat.

221
00:12:08,965 --> 00:12:09,693
I didn't say a word.

222
00:12:09,766 --> 00:12:11,165
I promise, honest.

223
00:12:11,234 --> 00:12:13,327
Joys of owning your
own home again, Jack.

224
00:12:13,403 --> 00:12:15,428
Don't tell me about it.

225
00:12:15,505 --> 00:12:16,529
Have you seen these bills.

226
00:12:16,606 --> 00:12:18,369
Look at this lot.

227
00:12:18,441 --> 00:12:21,672
I've got electricity, gas,
telephone, council tax,

228
00:12:21,745 --> 00:12:24,111
you pay one and there's
another one on the way.

229
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,477
If this carries on much longer

230
00:12:25,548 --> 00:12:26,572
I'm going to end up

231
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:29,015
delivering pizzas
in the evening.

232
00:12:29,085 --> 00:12:32,885
I might be able to
help you out there.

233
00:12:32,956 --> 00:12:33,684
Why?

234
00:12:33,757 --> 00:12:35,054
Had a win on the lottery?

235
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,353
Or are you selling
lost property

236
00:12:36,426 --> 00:12:38,121
at the car boot sales again?

237
00:12:38,194 --> 00:12:40,628
No, I've got a new
constable starting today.

238
00:12:40,697 --> 00:12:42,187
Tom Haliday.

239
00:12:42,265 --> 00:12:43,425
He did have his
digs sorted out

240
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,990
but they've just
fallen through.

241
00:12:45,068 --> 00:12:46,000
It would only be short term

242
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:48,731
until he finds
something permanent.

243
00:12:48,805 --> 00:12:51,330
Does he speak only
when he's spoken to?

244
00:12:51,407 --> 00:12:52,499
I'd say so.

245
00:12:52,575 --> 00:12:54,668
Yeah.

246
00:12:54,744 --> 00:12:56,371
Right, sold.

247
00:12:56,446 --> 00:12:58,641
I've got a spare
key here somewhere.

248
00:12:58,715 --> 00:13:00,046
Hang about.

249
00:13:00,116 --> 00:13:00,844
There it is.

250
00:13:00,917 --> 00:13:02,578
Right, he can let himself in.

251
00:13:02,652 --> 00:13:03,710
Oh, Jack, there's just...

252
00:13:03,787 --> 00:13:05,721
As long as he leaves me
alone and pays his rent

253
00:13:05,789 --> 00:13:07,279
I don't care if
he's got two heads.

254
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:11,525
She was definitely
sleeping rough.

255
00:13:11,594 --> 00:13:13,152
Probably sixteen,

256
00:13:13,229 --> 00:13:16,630
small, young for her age.

257
00:13:16,699 --> 00:13:19,634
Something odd,
given the background,

258
00:13:19,702 --> 00:13:21,932
she'd recently used cosmetics.

259
00:13:22,005 --> 00:13:22,937
They've been wiped away,

260
00:13:23,006 --> 00:13:24,234
but there are
traces of lipstick

261
00:13:24,307 --> 00:13:25,535
at the corners of her mouth,

262
00:13:25,608 --> 00:13:29,374
mascara on the lashes.

263
00:13:29,445 --> 00:13:31,538
Any evidence of
sexual assault?

264
00:13:31,614 --> 00:13:32,706
No.

265
00:13:32,782 --> 00:13:33,373
Drugs?

266
00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:34,347
No.

267
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:36,112
Her stomach contained alcohol.

268
00:13:36,186 --> 00:13:37,118
And quite a lot of

269
00:13:37,187 --> 00:13:40,179
what I think tests
will prove to be aspirin.

270
00:13:40,256 --> 00:13:41,689
That could be suicide?

271
00:13:41,758 --> 00:13:43,248
I can't speak
for her motives,

272
00:13:43,326 --> 00:13:44,987
but it wasn't
enough to kill her.

273
00:13:45,061 --> 00:13:47,222
Anyway there is no doubt
about the cause of death.

274
00:13:47,297 --> 00:13:49,094
Asphyxia by drowning.

275
00:13:49,165 --> 00:13:50,860
However I would point out

276
00:13:50,934 --> 00:13:54,165
the bruising McKenzie
mentioned in his report.

277
00:13:54,237 --> 00:13:56,296
It's quite extensive.

278
00:13:56,372 --> 00:13:59,808
On the arm and as
you've seen on the leg.

279
00:13:59,876 --> 00:14:02,743
Inflicted by fists,
I'd say, and feet.

280
00:14:02,812 --> 00:14:04,211
She was kicked and punched,

281
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,908
and with considerable force.

282
00:14:06,983 --> 00:14:08,746
Jack,

283
00:14:08,818 --> 00:14:10,649
the computer's
come up with a match.

284
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,517
She was a Jane Owens.

285
00:14:12,589 --> 00:14:15,319
Parents Geoff and
Christine Owens.

286
00:14:15,391 --> 00:14:17,052
Living in Bridgend.

287
00:14:17,126 --> 00:14:20,562
She'd been missing
nearly six months.

288
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,495
Anyone reached the parents?

289
00:14:22,565 --> 00:14:25,056
Yeah, South Wales
have been in contact.

290
00:14:25,134 --> 00:14:28,592
They'll be here
in the morning.

291
00:14:28,671 --> 00:14:30,366
What a journey.

292
00:14:45,221 --> 00:14:46,449
I'm late, I'm late,

293
00:14:46,522 --> 00:14:47,546
Julia, I'm sorry!

294
00:14:47,624 --> 00:14:49,091
I don't care about you Gerry,

295
00:14:49,158 --> 00:14:51,388
so long as you've
brought the first course.

296
00:14:51,461 --> 00:14:52,621
Three dozen oysters.

297
00:14:52,695 --> 00:14:54,026
Fresh in Ostend this morning.

298
00:14:54,097 --> 00:14:56,588
Guaranteed not
to kill the guests.

299
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,759
I'll see to these.

300
00:14:58,835 --> 00:15:02,862
You can get me a
glass of champagne.

301
00:15:02,939 --> 00:15:05,134
I'm just going to go
and hop in the pool.

302
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,903
They'll be here
in half an hour!

303
00:15:06,976 --> 00:15:09,444
Yeah, and the boys will be
home from school tomorrow.

304
00:15:09,512 --> 00:15:12,675
the last chance I get it to
have it to myself for a month.

305
00:15:12,749 --> 00:15:13,613
Don't worry,

306
00:15:13,683 --> 00:15:14,843
I'll come and
answer the door,

307
00:15:14,918 --> 00:15:16,749
even if it is in my trunks.

308
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,574
I don't believe it.

309
00:15:42,645 --> 00:15:44,613
Now what!

310
00:15:59,896 --> 00:16:00,828
That'll do, Kai!

311
00:16:00,897 --> 00:16:02,228
Sit.

312
00:16:04,334 --> 00:16:06,097
Inspector Frost,

313
00:16:06,169 --> 00:16:07,659
I'm Tom Haliday.

314
00:16:07,737 --> 00:16:09,864
Constable Haliday.

315
00:16:09,939 --> 00:16:11,338
And your friend?

316
00:16:11,407 --> 00:16:12,567
This is Kaiser,

317
00:16:12,642 --> 00:16:14,200
but I call him
Kai for short.

318
00:16:14,277 --> 00:16:15,369
You know, Kaiser,

319
00:16:15,445 --> 00:16:16,503
as in the
First World war,

320
00:16:16,579 --> 00:16:17,341
the German?

321
00:16:17,413 --> 00:16:18,812
Yes, all right,

322
00:16:18,881 --> 00:16:21,042
I am aware of that.

323
00:16:21,117 --> 00:16:22,482
But before we
get too involved

324
00:16:22,552 --> 00:16:24,986
in 20th century
European history

325
00:16:25,054 --> 00:16:26,248
maybe you'd like to tell me

326
00:16:26,322 --> 00:16:28,688
what that bloody dog
is doing in my house!

327
00:16:28,758 --> 00:16:29,690
He's with me.

328
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,092
Well, I didn't think he was
with the Jehovah's Witnesses.

329
00:16:33,162 --> 00:16:34,129
I'm a dog handler.

330
00:16:34,197 --> 00:16:38,224
Didn't the Sergeant tell you?

331
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:39,791
No.

332
00:16:39,869 --> 00:16:41,894
And why aren't my
ruddy lights working?

333
00:16:41,971 --> 00:16:43,029
I had a look at your fuses.

334
00:16:43,106 --> 00:16:44,368
They're OK.

335
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,135
I'd say there's
been a power cut,

336
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:49,576
unless you haven't
been paying your bills.

337
00:18:00,783 --> 00:18:02,148
Slow.

338
00:18:19,735 --> 00:18:21,362
Tools, Joop!

339
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:05,846
(Noise)

340
00:19:05,915 --> 00:19:07,177
Shit.

341
00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:37,641
Shit.

342
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,900
All set?

343
00:20:10,968 --> 00:20:13,232
I'll be reconnected
this afternoon.

344
00:20:13,304 --> 00:20:14,396
No problem?

345
00:20:14,472 --> 00:20:15,564
No.

346
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,195
I've given them two hundred
and sixteen quid for the bill,

347
00:20:17,269 --> 00:20:19,260
I've given them two hundred
quid for the deposit.

348
00:20:19,337 --> 00:20:20,702
And they have
given me nothing off

349
00:20:20,772 --> 00:20:22,399
for good behavior.

350
00:20:22,474 --> 00:20:23,441
So, come on George,

351
00:20:23,508 --> 00:20:24,475
I've done the housekeeping,

352
00:20:24,543 --> 00:20:27,341
I'd like to spend the rest
of the day as a copper.

353
00:21:19,497 --> 00:21:21,431
What do we have to do?

354
00:21:25,737 --> 00:21:30,504
I'll take you
through that later.

355
00:21:30,575 --> 00:21:33,669
I'm afraid that
Jane can't be moved.

356
00:21:33,745 --> 00:21:36,714
Just yet.

357
00:21:36,781 --> 00:21:39,375
We just want to take her home.

358
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,983
Yes, I know.

359
00:21:46,124 --> 00:21:47,091
I think it's best

360
00:21:47,158 --> 00:21:50,855
if we have a little
chat down at the station.

361
00:21:50,929 --> 00:21:54,956
I'd like to talk to you
a little bit about Jane.

362
00:21:55,033 --> 00:21:57,797
What she was like.

363
00:21:57,869 --> 00:22:00,736
It just might help.

364
00:22:00,805 --> 00:22:03,672
When you're ready.

365
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,628
Come on, Geoff.

366
00:22:27,699 --> 00:22:30,190
There's no Jane here.

367
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:41,103
I have made a
note, Mrs. Barber.

368
00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:42,908
Name, description.

369
00:22:42,981 --> 00:22:45,279
There really is nothing
we can do at the moment.

370
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,908
It's only a matter of what,

371
00:22:46,985 --> 00:22:48,782
fourteen, fifteen hours?

372
00:22:48,853 --> 00:22:51,287
Now, you might find if you
were to ring his office...

373
00:22:51,356 --> 00:22:54,154
I know where he
went last night.

374
00:22:54,225 --> 00:22:55,749
Ryan's Meat Processing.

375
00:22:55,827 --> 00:22:57,920
And he didn't come home.

376
00:22:57,996 --> 00:23:00,464
I want him found.

377
00:23:00,532 --> 00:23:03,433
We'll see if we can
get you a cup of tea.

378
00:23:03,501 --> 00:23:04,763
You go on ahead,

379
00:23:04,836 --> 00:23:06,167
I won't be a minute.

380
00:23:06,237 --> 00:23:08,831
I know that this is the
last place you want to be.

381
00:23:08,907 --> 00:23:10,932
I am not here for pleasure.

382
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:12,067
I know my husband.

383
00:23:12,143 --> 00:23:14,441
I know something is wrong!

384
00:23:14,512 --> 00:23:15,410
George?

385
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,845
Got a minute?

386
00:23:16,915 --> 00:23:19,281
Could you just hang on,
please, Mrs. Barber.

387
00:23:22,587 --> 00:23:23,246
Yeah?

388
00:23:23,321 --> 00:23:24,652
When the next relief goes out

389
00:23:24,723 --> 00:23:26,782
make sure uniform
have got photographs

390
00:23:26,858 --> 00:23:28,758
of the Owens girl,
you know the body.

391
00:23:28,827 --> 00:23:29,919
Also get a set of these,

392
00:23:29,995 --> 00:23:31,587
they've been brought
in by the parents.

393
00:23:31,663 --> 00:23:32,652
Get them copied.

394
00:23:32,731 --> 00:23:34,926
I want to know who she knew,

395
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,399
where she hung out,
you know.

396
00:23:36,468 --> 00:23:37,696
Where she slept.

397
00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:38,929
Must be somebody out there

398
00:23:39,004 --> 00:23:40,562
who'd seen her
in the last few days.

399
00:23:40,638 --> 00:23:41,730
These kids are invisible

400
00:23:41,806 --> 00:23:42,966
as far as most
people are concerned.

401
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,702
When you have
finished in here.

402
00:23:44,776 --> 00:23:46,243
I can see you're busy.

403
00:23:46,311 --> 00:23:47,801
Husband went AWOL last night.

404
00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:49,847
Don't envy him
when he gets back.

405
00:23:49,914 --> 00:23:52,405
Do I look as if I'm so stupid

406
00:23:52,484 --> 00:23:53,951
that I'd walk into
a police station

407
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:57,352
just because my husband's
been out on a piss?

408
00:24:04,462 --> 00:24:05,986
Thanks, George.

409
00:24:06,064 --> 00:24:07,395
Thank you.

410
00:24:07,465 --> 00:24:11,060
Well, she did ask to
see someone from CID.

411
00:24:11,136 --> 00:24:12,660
How long's he been missing?

412
00:24:12,737 --> 00:24:13,863
Last night.

413
00:24:13,938 --> 00:24:16,133
He's an Environmental
Health Inspector,

414
00:24:16,207 --> 00:24:16,969
she reckons he

415
00:24:17,042 --> 00:24:18,907
was trying to get into
Ryan's Meat Processing,

416
00:24:18,977 --> 00:24:19,841
on the quiet,

417
00:24:19,911 --> 00:24:21,435
thinks they're up
to something dodgy.

418
00:24:21,513 --> 00:24:23,879
Now Jack, do you
think that's likely?

419
00:24:23,948 --> 00:24:25,210
I reckon he's gone
over the side.

420
00:24:25,283 --> 00:24:27,683
Come on.

421
00:24:27,752 --> 00:24:30,312
That reminds me I've got
a bone to pick with you.

422
00:24:30,388 --> 00:24:32,322
It's a room I'm
letting, not a kennel.

423
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,914
Jack, I would have told you.

424
00:24:33,992 --> 00:24:35,857
Yeah well.

425
00:24:35,927 --> 00:24:37,622
Look why don't
you send someone

426
00:24:37,695 --> 00:24:39,162
down to that meat place.

427
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,993
And while you're at it
get someone to check out

428
00:24:41,066 --> 00:24:43,534
with traffic and hospitals.

429
00:24:50,308 --> 00:24:52,902
First we thought
it was accident,

430
00:24:52,977 --> 00:24:54,308
then at the mortuary,

431
00:24:54,379 --> 00:24:59,442
they talked as if
she'd killed herself.

432
00:24:59,517 --> 00:25:02,714
Well, we don't know.

433
00:25:02,787 --> 00:25:04,516
We're trying to put
together a picture

434
00:25:04,589 --> 00:25:06,557
of the last few
days of Jane's life.

435
00:25:06,624 --> 00:25:09,957
Especially her last evening.

436
00:25:10,028 --> 00:25:14,158
Is there anything that
you could help me with?

437
00:25:14,232 --> 00:25:15,722
We haven't seen
or heard from her,

438
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,859
not from the
day she walked out.

439
00:25:17,936 --> 00:25:20,063
She didn't tell
us she was going.

440
00:25:20,138 --> 00:25:22,538
She just left a note to say,

441
00:25:22,607 --> 00:25:24,939
she had to go.

442
00:25:25,009 --> 00:25:26,567
I see.

443
00:25:26,644 --> 00:25:28,805
Did she know anyone
here in Denton?

444
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,676
No.

445
00:25:29,747 --> 00:25:30,771
We've never been here.

446
00:25:30,849 --> 00:25:32,077
We thought she was in London.

447
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,515
There was a description
of someone like her,

448
00:25:33,585 --> 00:25:35,212
a few days after she went.

449
00:25:35,286 --> 00:25:38,744
It was a service
station on the M4.

450
00:25:38,823 --> 00:25:40,051
We tried everything.

451
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:42,389
We put adverts in papers.

452
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,428
We went to London
for days on end

453
00:25:44,496 --> 00:25:46,987
and just walked round.

454
00:25:47,065 --> 00:25:50,523
We still do, did.

455
00:25:50,602 --> 00:25:52,263
It was the only
place we could think,

456
00:25:52,337 --> 00:25:54,532
it's where people
go isn't it?

457
00:25:57,642 --> 00:26:00,406
Have you any idea
why she left home?

458
00:26:00,478 --> 00:26:01,376
No.

459
00:26:01,446 --> 00:26:03,038
No.

460
00:26:03,114 --> 00:26:05,582
You know, we didn't
even argue much,

461
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,277
not considering
she was fifteen,

462
00:26:07,352 --> 00:26:09,547
the way teenagers...

463
00:26:09,621 --> 00:26:11,054
we thought we were so lucky.

464
00:26:11,122 --> 00:26:12,680
Her brother was
very different.

465
00:26:12,757 --> 00:26:13,655
He's older,

466
00:26:13,725 --> 00:26:16,785
and he was a
nightmare at her age.

467
00:26:16,861 --> 00:26:18,488
She was doing so
well at school, wasn't she?

468
00:26:18,563 --> 00:26:19,757
She enjoyed it.

469
00:26:19,831 --> 00:26:20,889
She had good friends,

470
00:26:20,965 --> 00:26:22,660
people we liked.

471
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:27,665
And what about her brother?

472
00:26:27,739 --> 00:26:28,899
Mark.

473
00:26:28,973 --> 00:26:30,338
Has she had any
contact with him?

474
00:26:30,408 --> 00:26:32,103
No.

475
00:26:35,513 --> 00:26:39,609
I'm sorry there isn't any
answers in all of this.

476
00:26:39,684 --> 00:26:42,175
Is just that I'm trying to
build up a picture of Jane.

477
00:26:42,253 --> 00:26:43,481
You know,

478
00:26:43,555 --> 00:26:45,887
what she was really like.

479
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:50,550
At least we can
talk about her.

480
00:27:04,442 --> 00:27:06,967
The only thing
that did happen

481
00:27:07,045 --> 00:27:08,945
was a friend of hers died.

482
00:27:09,013 --> 00:27:11,573
Angie.

483
00:27:11,649 --> 00:27:14,015
It was eighteen
months ago now.

484
00:27:14,085 --> 00:27:17,145
It upset her a lot,

485
00:27:17,222 --> 00:27:20,885
and I'm not saying
she'd forgotten,

486
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:23,120
but it wasn't...

487
00:27:23,194 --> 00:27:25,389
She was an very
ordinary girl,

488
00:27:25,463 --> 00:27:30,230
who was enjoying
growing up, we thought.

489
00:27:30,301 --> 00:27:33,134
We were close, Mr Frost,

490
00:27:33,204 --> 00:27:34,865
very close,

491
00:27:34,939 --> 00:27:38,102
all of us.

492
00:27:38,176 --> 00:27:40,701
We've never understood.

493
00:27:44,983 --> 00:27:47,417
Inspector, where did she die?

494
00:28:16,047 --> 00:28:17,912
We found them
somewhere to stay?

495
00:28:17,982 --> 00:28:20,075
Yeah, it's all done.

496
00:28:20,151 --> 00:28:24,110
So far we know
precisely nothing.

497
00:28:24,188 --> 00:28:27,214
We don't even know how
long she'd been in Denton.

498
00:28:27,292 --> 00:28:29,260
If she'd just got here,

499
00:28:29,327 --> 00:28:31,090
maybe nobody did know her.

500
00:28:33,064 --> 00:28:34,827
Well somebody did.

501
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:37,390
Who brought those flowers?

502
00:28:40,538 --> 00:28:44,804
Mrs. Barber, I really don't
know what this is all about.

503
00:28:44,876 --> 00:28:48,312
The police have been
here this morning.

504
00:28:48,379 --> 00:28:50,313
I've told them
everything I know.

505
00:28:50,381 --> 00:28:51,905
He came here last night.

506
00:28:51,983 --> 00:28:53,974
He'd no reason to
be here last night.

507
00:28:54,052 --> 00:28:55,212
The place was shut up.

508
00:28:55,286 --> 00:28:56,583
There was nobody here.

509
00:28:56,654 --> 00:28:58,121
There's nothing
else I can say.

510
00:28:58,189 --> 00:29:00,180
You could tell me the truth!

511
00:29:00,258 --> 00:29:01,452
I don't pretend
your husband and I

512
00:29:01,526 --> 00:29:02,891
didn't have our differences.

513
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,621
Frankly I felt he
had a personal grudge

514
00:29:04,696 --> 00:29:06,323
about me and my business.

515
00:29:06,397 --> 00:29:09,093
I even went so far as
complaining to his superiors.

516
00:29:09,167 --> 00:29:12,136
But what you're
suggesting is, ridiculous.

517
00:29:12,203 --> 00:29:13,363
That's it.

518
00:29:13,438 --> 00:29:15,099
I really would
like you to leave.

519
00:29:15,173 --> 00:29:17,266
My husband is
missing, Mr. Ryan,

520
00:29:17,342 --> 00:29:19,833
and I know he came here.

521
00:29:19,911 --> 00:29:21,970
The police may not
want to listen to me,

522
00:29:22,046 --> 00:29:23,343
but they will.

523
00:29:23,414 --> 00:29:27,407
Because I am not going to
stop shouting until they do.

524
00:29:38,996 --> 00:29:40,395
It's no good having
a go at me, love.

525
00:29:40,465 --> 00:29:41,989
You're just protecting Ryan!

526
00:29:42,066 --> 00:29:43,328
But let me tell
you something.

527
00:29:43,401 --> 00:29:44,629
I know you're
in on it as well,

528
00:29:44,702 --> 00:29:45,999
and I'm going to be back!

529
00:29:50,608 --> 00:29:52,371
(Truck horn)

530
00:30:20,872 --> 00:30:21,600
I'll see you.

531
00:30:21,672 --> 00:30:23,697
Thanks.

532
00:30:23,775 --> 00:30:24,742
One of ours, Sergeant?

533
00:30:24,809 --> 00:30:25,867
No one of mine.

534
00:30:25,943 --> 00:30:26,875
Your lodger.

535
00:30:26,944 --> 00:30:28,468
Oh, really, what happened.

536
00:30:28,546 --> 00:30:29,945
Kaiser bite him did he?

537
00:30:30,014 --> 00:30:31,606
Constable Haliday
tripped over the dog

538
00:30:31,682 --> 00:30:32,580
and down the stairs.

539
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,480
Oh dear.

540
00:30:33,551 --> 00:30:34,813
Wait 'till you
hear the best bit.

541
00:30:34,886 --> 00:30:36,581
The dog was only trying
to arrest Mr. Mullett,

542
00:30:36,654 --> 00:30:39,316
who was going up the
stairs at the same time.

543
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,982
Trying to arrest Mullett.

544
00:30:41,058 --> 00:30:41,683
I love it.

545
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:42,851
That dog grows on me.

546
00:30:42,927 --> 00:30:44,986
Ah, well I hope so because
the dog's in your office now.

547
00:30:45,062 --> 00:30:45,494
He what?

548
00:30:45,563 --> 00:30:47,463
Haliday asked if you
could look after him.

549
00:30:47,532 --> 00:30:49,022
What do you mean he asked,
what do you mean,

550
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,260
Oi!

551
00:30:54,105 --> 00:30:55,402
Excuse me gentlemen.

552
00:30:55,473 --> 00:30:56,531
If you would
like a cup of tea

553
00:30:56,607 --> 00:30:59,007
there's plenty of time.

554
00:30:59,076 --> 00:31:00,907
Come on boys, I'll show you.

555
00:31:03,414 --> 00:31:05,109
Hello, Inspector.

556
00:31:05,183 --> 00:31:06,548
Bit of bad luck,

557
00:31:06,617 --> 00:31:09,279
What's this about the dog?

558
00:31:09,353 --> 00:31:11,014
I'll be back before
you know I've gone

559
00:31:11,088 --> 00:31:13,921
they've only got to
put the ankle in plaster.

560
00:31:13,991 --> 00:31:15,549
Now listen to me, Constable.

561
00:31:15,626 --> 00:31:17,355
I am not babysitting your dog.

562
00:31:17,428 --> 00:31:18,861
There are handlers
in this station,

563
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:20,488
he can go with one of them.

564
00:31:20,565 --> 00:31:22,999
That's the problem.

565
00:31:23,067 --> 00:31:24,557
What is?

566
00:31:24,635 --> 00:31:26,626
He's not...

567
00:31:26,704 --> 00:31:30,003
Kai's not exactly
on top of the job yet.

568
00:31:30,074 --> 00:31:31,041
do you known what I mean?

569
00:31:31,108 --> 00:31:32,268
I know exactly what you mean.

570
00:31:32,343 --> 00:31:33,241
It looks to me as though

571
00:31:33,311 --> 00:31:35,245
you two have got
something in common.

572
00:31:35,313 --> 00:31:37,076
We both scraped
through the course.

573
00:31:37,148 --> 00:31:38,547
I can sort him out,

574
00:31:38,616 --> 00:31:40,743
but I reckon if any
of the other handlers
try and work him,

575
00:31:40,818 --> 00:31:42,445
he could get kicked out.

576
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,010
Look, all you've
got to do is feed him,

577
00:31:44,088 --> 00:31:45,749
give him a bit of a walk.

578
00:31:45,823 --> 00:31:47,051
I had set up with the bank

579
00:31:47,124 --> 00:31:49,092
to pay you a month's
rent in advance,

580
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,991
but if Kai can't stay on,

581
00:31:51,062 --> 00:31:54,361
maybe I'll have to
look for somewhere else.

582
00:31:57,869 --> 00:31:59,200
How long's this going to be?

583
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:01,602
Like I said, I'll
probably be home tomorrow.

584
00:32:01,672 --> 00:32:03,503
Tonight, maybe.

585
00:32:03,574 --> 00:32:06,805
I expect to be
hearing from your bank.

586
00:32:15,486 --> 00:32:16,714
Are you two going
to stand there

587
00:32:16,787 --> 00:32:18,277
swilling tea all day?

588
00:32:18,356 --> 00:32:21,814
or are you going to get
that man to hospital?

589
00:32:25,129 --> 00:32:26,528
All right, come on,
settle down.

590
00:32:26,597 --> 00:32:27,894
Settle down.

591
00:32:27,965 --> 00:32:29,455
Come on.

592
00:32:30,368 --> 00:32:33,360
Okay, so we've got no
record of Jane Owens.

593
00:32:33,437 --> 00:32:35,769
She hasn't been
picked up for anything.

594
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,832
A couple of uniform think
they could have seen her.

595
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:40,343
So they'll be trying
to talk to people

596
00:32:40,411 --> 00:32:41,844
who might have known her.

597
00:32:41,913 --> 00:32:43,847
You don't reckon she's
been around Denton long?

598
00:32:43,915 --> 00:32:45,974
No that seems
very unlikely.

599
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:47,847
Uniform have got
a pretty good idea

600
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,114
who's sleeping
rough on their patch.

601
00:32:50,187 --> 00:32:51,654
The problem is you'll
be talking to people

602
00:32:51,722 --> 00:32:54,156
who don't want
to talk to you.

603
00:32:54,225 --> 00:32:56,386
'Cos any time we
want information

604
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,757
they think they're in trouble

605
00:32:57,828 --> 00:32:58,760
and when they're in trouble

606
00:32:58,829 --> 00:33:00,353
they don't know anything.

607
00:33:00,431 --> 00:33:02,695
And they haven't
seen anything.

608
00:33:02,767 --> 00:33:04,234
Are drugs involved?

609
00:33:04,302 --> 00:33:06,668
No, not as far as we know.

610
00:33:06,737 --> 00:33:09,604
Drugs have been fairly
quiet since our last push.

611
00:33:09,674 --> 00:33:10,732
Jane wasn't a user,

612
00:33:10,808 --> 00:33:12,708
and she certainly
wasn't selling.

613
00:33:12,777 --> 00:33:16,304
No, but she was
out on the streets.

614
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,678
So she must have known
people who were on drugs

615
00:33:18,749 --> 00:33:21,183
or maybe even
dealing in them,

616
00:33:21,252 --> 00:33:23,345
you know muggers,

617
00:33:23,421 --> 00:33:24,649
thieves,

618
00:33:24,722 --> 00:33:26,519
prostitutes.

619
00:33:26,591 --> 00:33:28,684
All of them not
very talkative.

620
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:31,250
How many of them are
there living rough out there?

621
00:33:31,329 --> 00:33:34,230
Sergeant Brady reckons
30, 40 at any one time,

622
00:33:34,298 --> 00:33:35,390
across the area.

623
00:33:35,466 --> 00:33:36,956
Isn't this a job for uniform?

624
00:33:37,034 --> 00:33:38,661
I mean they know these people.

625
00:33:38,736 --> 00:33:40,533
Yes, uniform.

626
00:33:46,544 --> 00:33:51,277
This morning I had to go
and identify the body

627
00:33:51,349 --> 00:33:54,045
of 'one of these people'

628
00:33:54,118 --> 00:33:56,746
with her parents.

629
00:33:56,821 --> 00:33:59,619
Now until proven otherwise,

630
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:03,558
this is a suspicious death.

631
00:34:03,628 --> 00:34:09,726
And no address does not
mean no investigation.

632
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,258
So you take those
photographs down to the DSS

633
00:34:13,337 --> 00:34:16,568
and see if she was on
benefit, all right?

634
00:34:16,641 --> 00:34:18,165
Sir.

635
00:34:18,242 --> 00:34:19,766
Thank you.

636
00:34:21,445 --> 00:34:22,707
All right,
now what we've got here

637
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:27,808
is a list of places where
kids were known to doss.

638
00:34:27,885 --> 00:34:30,251
Uniform leave
them alone mostly

639
00:34:30,321 --> 00:34:32,152
because there's nowhere
to move them on to

640
00:34:32,223 --> 00:34:33,281
except a police cell

641
00:34:33,357 --> 00:34:35,655
and there's not
much point in that.

642
00:34:35,726 --> 00:34:37,023
All right that's all.

643
00:34:37,094 --> 00:34:38,584
Go out and see
what you can find.

644
00:34:38,663 --> 00:34:39,994
Chop chop.

645
00:34:42,667 --> 00:34:44,134
Told you, Jack.

646
00:34:44,201 --> 00:34:45,259
What?

647
00:34:45,336 --> 00:34:46,803
Invisible.

648
00:34:46,871 --> 00:34:49,271
Once you get beyond
Mr. and Mrs. Owens,

649
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:53,470
Jane's not very high on
anybody's list of priorities.

650
00:34:53,544 --> 00:34:55,273
She is on mine.

651
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:09,189
Jack,

652
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:09,749
Mullett.

653
00:35:09,827 --> 00:35:10,521
You what?

654
00:35:10,594 --> 00:35:11,322
Mullett.

655
00:35:11,395 --> 00:35:12,054
Jack.

656
00:35:12,129 --> 00:35:12,891
Sir?

657
00:35:12,963 --> 00:35:14,624
I don't know if you
recall the expression

658
00:35:14,699 --> 00:35:16,098
'read my lips'.

659
00:35:16,167 --> 00:35:18,294
My lips are saying
'crime figures'.

660
00:35:18,369 --> 00:35:20,428
Now I don't know how many
times I have to say the words,

661
00:35:20,504 --> 00:35:22,768
but I really must insist...

662
00:35:25,443 --> 00:35:27,775
Is that dog still here?

663
00:35:27,845 --> 00:35:29,073
Yes, yes sir.

664
00:35:29,146 --> 00:35:31,080
He's on a detection course.

665
00:35:31,148 --> 00:35:32,979
Well I hope he can teach
you something, Inspector.

666
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:34,312
Teach me.

667
00:35:34,385 --> 00:35:35,249
Very good, Mr. Mullett.

668
00:35:35,319 --> 00:35:36,684
Now Jack, there are limits.

669
00:35:36,754 --> 00:35:40,087
Limits to the time I can
wait, every month...

670
00:35:40,157 --> 00:35:43,354
(Dog growling)

671
00:35:45,996 --> 00:35:46,690
Good boy.

672
00:35:46,764 --> 00:35:47,731
Kai.

673
00:35:47,798 --> 00:35:48,890
Stay.

674
00:35:48,966 --> 00:35:50,365
Good boy.

675
00:35:52,002 --> 00:35:54,300
Get that animal in the
kennels immediately.

676
00:35:57,808 --> 00:35:58,604
Good boy.

677
00:35:58,676 --> 00:36:00,200
Now that's what
I call a police dog.

678
00:36:00,277 --> 00:36:03,269
Anyone thought of making
him Chief Constable.

679
00:36:03,347 --> 00:36:04,837
Yeah, good boy.

680
00:36:14,024 --> 00:36:15,651
All right,
what have we got?

681
00:36:15,726 --> 00:36:17,091
Boy called Rickie.

682
00:36:17,161 --> 00:36:19,095
He's opposite
the shopping center.

683
00:36:19,163 --> 00:36:21,358
I think I saw him with
the girl, only once.

684
00:36:21,432 --> 00:36:22,399
I spoke to him,

685
00:36:22,466 --> 00:36:24,229
showed him the pictures.

686
00:36:24,301 --> 00:36:25,268
Nothing.

687
00:36:25,336 --> 00:36:27,065
I thought you might
want to have a go.

688
00:36:27,138 --> 00:36:28,435
All right, where is he?

689
00:36:28,506 --> 00:36:30,474
He's sitting on the
library steps, begging.

690
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:31,565
There were a
few others around,

691
00:36:31,642 --> 00:36:32,973
but they cleared
off when I turned up.

692
00:36:33,043 --> 00:36:34,169
All right, thanks.

693
00:36:35,379 --> 00:36:36,676
Hello boy.

694
00:36:38,749 --> 00:36:40,148
Rickie?

695
00:36:40,217 --> 00:36:42,014
Look,

696
00:36:42,086 --> 00:36:42,780
I told the woman pig,

697
00:36:42,853 --> 00:36:44,286
I don't know who it is,

698
00:36:44,355 --> 00:36:45,822
I never saw her.

699
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,380
Her name is Jane,

700
00:36:47,458 --> 00:36:48,925
it's Jane Owens.

701
00:36:48,993 --> 00:36:50,460
You were seen with her.

702
00:36:50,528 --> 00:36:51,324
Someone else.

703
00:36:51,395 --> 00:36:52,862
No not at all.

704
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:55,125
Look there's no hassle here.

705
00:36:58,502 --> 00:37:01,437
Jane is dead.

706
00:37:01,505 --> 00:37:02,494
Someone hurt her,

707
00:37:02,573 --> 00:37:04,268
maybe even killed her.

708
00:37:04,341 --> 00:37:06,969
Anything that
you know could help.

709
00:37:07,044 --> 00:37:09,535
Even if it's just
where you saw her last,

710
00:37:09,613 --> 00:37:11,547
where she was dosing.

711
00:37:11,615 --> 00:37:12,343
Something,

712
00:37:12,416 --> 00:37:16,216
a time, a place, a start.

713
00:37:16,287 --> 00:37:18,915
You do want to
help her, don't you?

714
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:22,925
It's too late
to help her now.

715
00:37:22,993 --> 00:37:24,517
Look.

716
00:37:24,595 --> 00:37:26,529
Look at this.

717
00:37:26,597 --> 00:37:27,723
That's how we found her

718
00:37:27,798 --> 00:37:30,733
when we dragged her
out of the canal.

719
00:37:30,801 --> 00:37:32,701
And before she was
thrown in there

720
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:35,796
someone had beaten
the hell out of her.

721
00:37:38,909 --> 00:37:41,139
I keep my head down,

722
00:37:41,212 --> 00:37:44,340
that's all I do.

723
00:37:44,415 --> 00:37:47,680
If you don't know anyone,
then people leave you alone.

724
00:37:47,751 --> 00:37:51,016
That's all I want.

725
00:37:51,088 --> 00:37:53,818
But you do know her, Rickie.

726
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:59,754
And you do care
about her, don't you?

727
00:38:05,336 --> 00:38:07,361
Come on.

728
00:38:07,438 --> 00:38:08,996
Come on.

729
00:38:21,151 --> 00:38:22,982
So how long you
two been together?

730
00:38:23,053 --> 00:38:24,452
Three months.

731
00:38:24,521 --> 00:38:25,488
We met up in London.

732
00:38:25,556 --> 00:38:26,580
Just dossing.

733
00:38:26,657 --> 00:38:28,488
We tried to look
after each other.

734
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:30,424
You don't know anyone
here in Denton?

735
00:38:30,494 --> 00:38:31,688
No.

736
00:38:31,762 --> 00:38:33,389
We wanted to
get out of London.

737
00:38:33,464 --> 00:38:36,160
This is as far as we got.

738
00:38:36,233 --> 00:38:37,791
We wanted to get
to the West Country,

739
00:38:37,868 --> 00:38:39,733
earn a living
busking and that.

740
00:38:39,803 --> 00:38:40,667
Jane could sing you know.

741
00:38:40,738 --> 00:38:42,399
I mean really sing.

742
00:38:42,473 --> 00:38:48,878
I need to know what
happened that night.

743
00:38:48,946 --> 00:38:50,641
We had a row, okay.

744
00:38:50,714 --> 00:38:52,682
About money.

745
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:55,116
She said she'd get some.

746
00:38:55,185 --> 00:38:56,482
She disappeared
for a few days

747
00:38:56,553 --> 00:38:58,680
and came back
with a couple of quid.

748
00:38:58,756 --> 00:39:00,621
She said...

749
00:39:01,892 --> 00:39:03,086
Yeah?

750
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:03,854
Go on.

751
00:39:03,928 --> 00:39:06,226
She said what?

752
00:39:06,297 --> 00:39:09,198
She said she'd seen what
went on at Bedford Park.

753
00:39:09,266 --> 00:39:10,790
She said there was
only one way left

754
00:39:10,868 --> 00:39:13,029
and that she'd get
some money that way.

755
00:39:13,103 --> 00:39:14,263
Prostitution.

756
00:39:14,338 --> 00:39:16,772
I didn't think she was in the
market for that sort of thing.

757
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,899
There's blokes who go
for crusty, believe me,

758
00:39:18,976 --> 00:39:21,706
male or female.

759
00:39:21,779 --> 00:39:22,404
Crusty?

760
00:39:22,479 --> 00:39:23,571
What do you mean, crusty?

761
00:39:23,647 --> 00:39:25,239
Dirty, filthy.

762
00:39:25,316 --> 00:39:27,614
As long as
you're young enough.

763
00:39:27,685 --> 00:39:29,676
Look, I tried to stop her.

764
00:39:29,753 --> 00:39:33,382
She said there was
only one way left.

765
00:39:33,457 --> 00:39:37,860
Oh, so, she went
to Bedford Park?

766
00:39:37,928 --> 00:39:40,795
I followed her.

767
00:39:40,864 --> 00:39:42,058
There were
prostitutes all over.

768
00:39:42,132 --> 00:39:44,657
They told her to piss off.

769
00:39:44,735 --> 00:39:46,760
I was going to make
her come back with me.

770
00:39:46,837 --> 00:39:48,634
Then this bloke stopped,

771
00:39:48,706 --> 00:39:50,867
in a black BMW.

772
00:39:50,941 --> 00:39:53,671
It was a just a few
seconds, that's all,

773
00:39:53,744 --> 00:39:55,371
and she got in.

774
00:39:55,446 --> 00:39:56,606
They drove away
and that was it.

775
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:00,081
I never saw her again.

776
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,983
Were you close enough
to see this man?

777
00:40:10,961 --> 00:40:11,950
Come on.

778
00:40:12,029 --> 00:40:13,894
Hey, hey, come here!

779
00:40:13,964 --> 00:40:15,090
Now wait.

780
00:40:15,165 --> 00:40:16,063
Heel!

781
00:40:16,133 --> 00:40:17,225
Heel, will you.

782
00:40:17,301 --> 00:40:18,632
Hey, will you.

783
00:40:18,702 --> 00:40:20,294
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, about that.

784
00:40:20,371 --> 00:40:21,895
Just a minute.

785
00:40:21,972 --> 00:40:25,169
Has there been any news?

786
00:40:25,242 --> 00:40:26,607
Not yet.

787
00:40:26,677 --> 00:40:29,942
Well, you know,
it's early days yet.

788
00:40:30,014 --> 00:40:31,504
It doesn't seem to
mean much when you say

789
00:40:31,582 --> 00:40:34,449
someone's missing in a
police station, does it?

790
00:40:34,518 --> 00:40:37,385
Sooner or later someone
is going to listen to me.

791
00:40:37,454 --> 00:40:39,820
Sooner would make it a lot
easier to get to the truth.

792
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:42,950
Look, we have been making
enquiries, Mrs. Barber.

793
00:40:43,027 --> 00:40:45,325
I don't know whether
there's any news come back...

794
00:40:45,396 --> 00:40:48,092
It's not likely to.

795
00:40:48,165 --> 00:40:50,326
A policeman went
round to ask Gerry Ryan

796
00:40:50,401 --> 00:40:52,460
whether he'd seen
my husband last night.

797
00:40:52,536 --> 00:40:53,434
When he said no,

798
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:55,904
I think that was about it,

799
00:40:55,973 --> 00:40:58,464
apart from the
apology for troubling him.

800
00:40:58,542 --> 00:41:01,602
I went round to see
Gerry Ryan myself

801
00:41:01,678 --> 00:41:04,442
and I would say he was
very troubled indeed.

802
00:41:04,515 --> 00:41:06,483
We are not ignoring this.

803
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,983
Good.

804
00:41:08,052 --> 00:41:11,783
I intend to make
damned sure you don't!

805
00:41:11,855 --> 00:41:13,584
You'll need some photographs.

806
00:41:13,657 --> 00:41:15,318
I've left them
at the Front Desk

807
00:41:15,392 --> 00:41:16,791
and I will be back

808
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:19,124
to see how you're getting on.

809
00:41:35,179 --> 00:41:38,307
Well, there's no doubt now
that the man is missing.

810
00:41:38,382 --> 00:41:39,906
You chased up the hospitals?

811
00:41:39,983 --> 00:41:40,540
Yeah.

812
00:41:40,617 --> 00:41:41,345
Nothing there.

813
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:42,112
Right.

814
00:41:42,186 --> 00:41:44,154
Well, get a description
out to all areas.

815
00:41:44,221 --> 00:41:45,779
Also details of his car.

816
00:41:45,856 --> 00:41:46,823
If he has done a runner

817
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:48,084
he's got to
turn up somewhere.

818
00:41:48,158 --> 00:41:49,523
Come on Kai.

819
00:41:49,593 --> 00:41:50,821
Oh, Jack.

820
00:41:50,894 --> 00:41:53,294
Mr. Mullett's been
on to me about the dog.

821
00:41:53,363 --> 00:41:54,330
What are you talking about.

822
00:41:54,398 --> 00:41:55,888
Haliday will be out
of hospital tomorrow.

823
00:41:55,966 --> 00:41:57,558
Kaiser can stay with him.

824
00:41:57,634 --> 00:41:58,328
Tomorrow?

825
00:41:58,402 --> 00:42:00,336
He'll be in till
the end of the week.

826
00:42:00,404 --> 00:42:01,234
What are you talking about?

827
00:42:01,305 --> 00:42:02,397
What with a broken ankle?

828
00:42:02,473 --> 00:42:04,065
And a torn ligament.

829
00:42:04,141 --> 00:42:06,041
A torn...

830
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:08,203
he never told me that!

831
00:42:08,278 --> 00:42:10,872
Well, he's not as
daft as he looks.

832
00:42:32,636 --> 00:42:33,864
What is it girl?

833
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:42,005
Come on, come on, come on.

834
00:43:00,197 --> 00:43:01,630
Morning, Jack.

835
00:43:01,698 --> 00:43:02,596
Morning, sir.

836
00:43:02,666 --> 00:43:04,896
You got that fax from
Humberside Police?

837
00:43:04,968 --> 00:43:05,992
Yes.

838
00:43:06,069 --> 00:43:07,400
It's a long way from Denton.

839
00:43:07,471 --> 00:43:08,836
A very long way
if you're dead.

840
00:43:08,906 --> 00:43:09,873
Quite.

841
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:13,239
And of course a severed arm
is hardly identification.

842
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:14,800
Yeah I know.

843
00:43:14,878 --> 00:43:16,505
A lot of things you
can get from it though.

844
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:19,913
You know, age,
height, weight, sex.

845
00:43:19,983 --> 00:43:22,008
Right color for Barber.

846
00:43:22,085 --> 00:43:23,950
Yeah, and a million others.

847
00:43:24,021 --> 00:43:27,752
Frankly Jack, I think
it's all rather far-fetched.

848
00:43:27,824 --> 00:43:29,815
Mmm, I know, I agree.

849
00:43:29,893 --> 00:43:31,884
The odds are against it.

850
00:43:31,962 --> 00:43:35,295
But supposing,
supposing it's true.

851
00:43:35,365 --> 00:43:37,492
Supposing this Barber,

852
00:43:37,568 --> 00:43:39,593
he goes to this
meat factory, right,

853
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:41,831
for reasons that
we don't know.

854
00:43:41,905 --> 00:43:43,532
Gets himself killed.

855
00:43:43,607 --> 00:43:44,665
There's no evidence

856
00:43:44,741 --> 00:43:46,641
that anything actually
has happened to Barber.

857
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:48,439
No, I know.

858
00:43:48,512 --> 00:43:50,673
I do think I ought to go to
Hull and check it out though.

859
00:43:50,747 --> 00:43:52,476
Jack, I cannot have
you gallivanting

860
00:43:52,549 --> 00:43:54,210
across the country on expenses

861
00:43:54,284 --> 00:43:58,152
for something
as fanciful as this.

862
00:43:58,222 --> 00:44:01,089
If there is anything to find
out about this severed arm,

863
00:44:01,158 --> 00:44:03,752
I'm sure that Humberside
will let us know.

864
00:44:05,829 --> 00:44:06,557
All right.

865
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:09,155
Could be embarrassing.

866
00:44:21,778 --> 00:44:24,576
What do you mean
'embarrassing'.

867
00:44:24,648 --> 00:44:26,047
Well look at it this way.

868
00:44:26,116 --> 00:44:28,209
A woman comes into
Denton Police Station

869
00:44:28,285 --> 00:44:30,549
saying her husband
has disappeared, right.

870
00:44:30,621 --> 00:44:32,953
She thinks he's in danger.

871
00:44:33,023 --> 00:44:35,253
Well, to put it
at its politest

872
00:44:35,325 --> 00:44:36,815
she's patted on the head

873
00:44:36,893 --> 00:44:39,987
and told he'll come
home when he's sober.

874
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:42,224
I mean,

875
00:44:42,299 --> 00:44:44,358
supposing it is him,

876
00:44:44,434 --> 00:44:47,528
well, part of him.

877
00:44:47,604 --> 00:44:49,697
I've got a feeling
that this Mrs. Barber

878
00:44:49,773 --> 00:44:51,240
is the sort of woman

879
00:44:51,308 --> 00:44:53,606
that would take this

880
00:44:53,677 --> 00:44:57,511
to the Police
Complaints Commission.

881
00:44:57,581 --> 00:44:59,572
Well, I wouldn't
want her to feel

882
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:03,711
that we weren't doing
everything we could.

883
00:45:03,787 --> 00:45:05,482
You're absolutely right, sir.

884
00:45:05,555 --> 00:45:07,216
I'll get up to
Hull straight away.

885
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:09,691
Meet this DI Alice Beale.

886
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,658
All right?

887
00:45:10,727 --> 00:45:12,194
Don't worry sir,

888
00:45:12,262 --> 00:45:13,354
there must be a limit

889
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:15,261
to what a night in
the fleshpots of Hull

890
00:45:15,332 --> 00:45:17,732
can set you back.

891
00:45:20,871 --> 00:45:23,635
Keep up surveillance
on Bedford Park.

892
00:45:23,707 --> 00:45:26,608
Follow up the BMW.

893
00:45:26,677 --> 00:45:28,770
Any news from the tarts.

894
00:45:28,845 --> 00:45:32,281
Several of their
descriptions match Rickie's.

895
00:45:32,349 --> 00:45:34,214
And there's at least one
sighting of that car

896
00:45:34,284 --> 00:45:35,842
on the night in question.

897
00:45:35,919 --> 00:45:38,513
The man's certainly not
a stranger up there.

898
00:45:38,588 --> 00:45:39,452
Mostly a looker,

899
00:45:39,523 --> 00:45:40,854
not a doer, apparently.

900
00:45:40,924 --> 00:45:42,585
Well, not any more.

901
00:45:42,659 --> 00:45:44,217
Hey, have a word with traffic.

902
00:45:44,294 --> 00:45:45,352
We've got security cameras

903
00:45:45,429 --> 00:45:46,953
on roads either
side of the park.

904
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:49,294
We might just catch
him going through.

905
00:45:49,366 --> 00:45:50,492
And Warren Barber?

906
00:45:50,567 --> 00:45:53,559
Well, go with his
wife's instincts.

907
00:45:53,637 --> 00:45:57,300
Find out if there
was a problem with
that meat factory.

908
00:45:57,374 --> 00:45:58,864
You know, what
was he looking for?

909
00:45:58,942 --> 00:46:00,500
Also have a
word with the owner,

910
00:46:00,577 --> 00:46:01,942
what's his name, Ryan.

911
00:46:02,012 --> 00:46:04,378
Just gentle
questioning, you know.

912
00:46:04,448 --> 00:46:06,746
Find out what
time they closed.

913
00:46:06,817 --> 00:46:08,910
Who was there last that
night, that sort of thing.

914
00:46:08,985 --> 00:46:12,284
Barber's just missing as
far as Ryan's concerned?

915
00:46:12,356 --> 00:46:14,415
Unless I can get
an ID from Hull,

916
00:46:14,491 --> 00:46:16,550
which seems to be unlikely.

917
00:46:16,626 --> 00:46:19,424
Oh, and have a sniff round
the meat trade will you?

918
00:46:19,496 --> 00:46:20,861
Just anything,

919
00:46:20,931 --> 00:46:23,798
find out if there's BSE or
something in the meat pies,

920
00:46:23,867 --> 00:46:24,834
that sort of thing.

921
00:46:24,901 --> 00:46:26,630
Jack, meat
processing's not exactly

922
00:46:26,703 --> 00:46:28,694
a specialty of my snouts.

923
00:46:28,772 --> 00:46:30,603
All right, if you
don't get anywhere

924
00:46:30,674 --> 00:46:32,266
I'll get Kaiser on the case.

925
00:46:32,342 --> 00:46:35,539
Kaiser's an expert in
the meat department.

926
00:46:35,612 --> 00:46:38,080
I mean why keep a
dog and bark yourself?

927
00:46:40,384 --> 00:46:41,214
See you in a bit, George.

928
00:46:41,284 --> 00:46:42,717
Chop chop!

929
00:46:51,261 --> 00:46:53,388
I really can't think of
anything else I can tell you.

930
00:46:53,463 --> 00:46:54,361
To be honest,

931
00:46:54,431 --> 00:46:56,661
I'm surprised
that these questions
are being asked again

932
00:46:56,733 --> 00:46:58,394
I did speak to an officer.

933
00:46:58,468 --> 00:46:59,833
Mr. Barber is missing.

934
00:46:59,903 --> 00:47:01,700
We obviously have
to do all we can

935
00:47:01,772 --> 00:47:03,330
to trace his last movements.

936
00:47:03,407 --> 00:47:05,534
His wife is saying
some pretty wild things.

937
00:47:05,609 --> 00:47:07,474
I thought I was going to have
to call the police myself,

938
00:47:07,544 --> 00:47:08,568
to get her out of here.

939
00:47:08,645 --> 00:47:10,306
She just burst in.

940
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,075
Well, she is
very upset, Mr. Ryan.

941
00:47:12,149 --> 00:47:13,548
I'm sure you can
understand that.

942
00:47:13,617 --> 00:47:15,517
Of course I can.

943
00:47:15,585 --> 00:47:17,075
That doesn't mean
I take very kindly

944
00:47:17,154 --> 00:47:19,418
to being accused of
God-knows what by the woman!

945
00:47:19,489 --> 00:47:21,548
This is just routine, sir.

946
00:47:21,625 --> 00:47:23,183
Questions are raised,

947
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:26,024
we have to answer them.

948
00:47:26,096 --> 00:47:28,360
Obviously your
guests will be happy

949
00:47:28,432 --> 00:47:31,890
to verify the details of
the dinner party that night?

950
00:47:31,968 --> 00:47:33,765
I am not lying
about where I was!

951
00:47:33,837 --> 00:47:36,362
As I say, sir, we
just have to check.

952
00:47:45,348 --> 00:47:46,474
Afternoon, Inspector.

953
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:47,744
Good afternoon.

954
00:47:50,687 --> 00:47:51,654
The pathologist's over

955
00:47:51,721 --> 00:47:53,279
at the Coroner's
Court in Beverley.

956
00:47:53,356 --> 00:47:54,653
If there's anything
we can't answer,

957
00:47:54,724 --> 00:47:56,282
he'll be available later.

958
00:47:56,359 --> 00:47:58,156
What there is,
is in the report.

959
00:47:58,228 --> 00:48:00,321
Thank you.

960
00:48:00,397 --> 00:48:02,297
What's the blood group?

961
00:48:02,365 --> 00:48:04,993
It's 'O, page five, in there.

962
00:48:05,068 --> 00:48:07,400
It's the right group
but it's too common.

963
00:48:07,471 --> 00:48:10,167
Other than to
give us verification.

964
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,970
Right profile, wrong place.

965
00:48:13,043 --> 00:48:14,704
Any evidence to suggest

966
00:48:14,778 --> 00:48:16,871
that this arm was dumped
where it was found.

967
00:48:16,947 --> 00:48:18,141
It's hard to say.

968
00:48:18,215 --> 00:48:19,182
What we do know is

969
00:48:19,249 --> 00:48:21,012
that it had been in the
water for some time.

970
00:48:21,084 --> 00:48:22,449
Not enough to do much damage,

971
00:48:22,519 --> 00:48:25,579
no more than
24 hours, probably less.

972
00:48:25,655 --> 00:48:28,488
That's even why it's less
likely to be Warren Barber.

973
00:48:28,558 --> 00:48:30,526
I mean, what on earth
was he doing in Hull,

974
00:48:30,594 --> 00:48:32,152
Iet alone the North Sea?

975
00:48:32,229 --> 00:48:34,163
According to the coastguard
it was just good luck

976
00:48:34,231 --> 00:48:37,029
the current brought
it ashore at all.

977
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:40,934
Or bad luck if you were
trying to get rid of a body.

978
00:48:41,004 --> 00:48:43,404
Just tell me something,

979
00:48:43,473 --> 00:48:45,668
could this have
happened in the water?

980
00:48:45,742 --> 00:48:47,835
You know, I don't mean Jaws,

981
00:48:47,911 --> 00:48:49,242
I mean a propeller.

982
00:48:49,312 --> 00:48:51,610
Someone falling off the back
of a ship, or an oil rig,

983
00:48:51,681 --> 00:48:52,613
something like that?

984
00:48:52,682 --> 00:48:55,344
No, the pathologist said
the limb was severed

985
00:48:55,418 --> 00:48:57,181
before it entered the water.

986
00:48:57,254 --> 00:49:00,917
It was cut off by some
kind of blade or saw.

987
00:49:04,461 --> 00:49:06,395
Tell me something,

988
00:49:06,463 --> 00:49:08,431
is there any evidence
that this man

989
00:49:08,498 --> 00:49:10,728
was ever near a meat factory?

990
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,290
You know, animal hair, blood,

991
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:14,303
underneath the fingernails,
anything like that?

992
00:49:14,371 --> 00:49:17,169
There's no forensic at all.

993
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,606
No, but it would be a perfect
place to cut up a body,

994
00:49:19,676 --> 00:49:21,337
wouldn't it?

995
00:49:21,411 --> 00:49:22,776
What about this wedding ring?

996
00:49:22,846 --> 00:49:24,074
It's back at the station.

997
00:49:24,147 --> 00:49:25,808
I doubt it'll give you
more than the blood group.

998
00:49:25,882 --> 00:49:28,350
It's like ten million others.

999
00:49:28,418 --> 00:49:30,283
Really, let's see.

1000
00:49:31,488 --> 00:49:33,183
Thanks.

1001
00:49:49,005 --> 00:49:50,370
No latent prints?

1002
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,532
Not a hint.

1003
00:49:53,276 --> 00:49:56,006
Funny thing to do when
you come to think about it.

1004
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,172
You go to all that
trouble to cut up a body

1005
00:49:58,248 --> 00:49:59,943
so it won't be recognized

1006
00:50:00,016 --> 00:50:02,644
and then you leave this on it.

1007
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:04,550
Still doesn't
help much though.

1008
00:50:04,621 --> 00:50:07,249
The man's wife would be
hard pushed to recognize it.

1009
00:50:07,324 --> 00:50:08,552
There's no
distinguishing features,

1010
00:50:08,625 --> 00:50:09,922
it's absolutely plain,

1011
00:50:09,993 --> 00:50:12,553
there's not even a
hallmark to give us a date.

1012
00:50:12,629 --> 00:50:13,561
It's eighteen carat

1013
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:16,190
but you could find a million
rings that look the same.

1014
00:50:16,266 --> 00:50:17,858
No you couldn't.

1015
00:50:17,934 --> 00:50:19,697
Not without a hallmark.

1016
00:50:19,769 --> 00:50:22,465
It's against the law.

1017
00:50:22,539 --> 00:50:25,508
It's probably not English.

1018
00:50:25,575 --> 00:50:26,633
Right.

1019
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:27,699
This is for you.

1020
00:50:27,777 --> 00:50:28,835
Sergeant Toolan.

1021
00:50:28,912 --> 00:50:30,812
Says he's got a name
and registration for,

1022
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,007
says, 'Bedford Park Bertie'?

1023
00:50:33,083 --> 00:50:34,880
Oh, right.

1024
00:50:34,951 --> 00:50:36,282
Thank you.

1025
00:50:38,254 --> 00:50:39,881
I'll tell you what.

1026
00:50:39,956 --> 00:50:42,015
I'd like to take this
with me if I could.

1027
00:50:42,092 --> 00:50:45,858
I'd like to show
it to Mrs. Barber.

1028
00:50:45,929 --> 00:50:48,056
As long as you sign for it.

1029
00:50:48,131 --> 00:50:48,790
All right.

1030
00:50:48,865 --> 00:50:49,889
I will.

1031
00:50:49,966 --> 00:50:51,092
George.

1032
00:50:51,167 --> 00:50:52,930
Yes, well done.

1033
00:50:53,003 --> 00:50:56,769
We'll pull him in first
thing in the morning.

1034
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,171
Of course I will,

1035
00:50:58,241 --> 00:51:00,801
I'm on my way now.

1036
00:51:00,877 --> 00:51:01,866
All right,

1037
00:51:04,381 --> 00:51:06,474
Oh, ok.

1038
00:51:06,549 --> 00:51:08,039
Come on, come on then.

1039
00:51:08,118 --> 00:51:09,244
Where is it.

1040
00:51:25,869 --> 00:51:30,431
(Phone ringing)

1041
00:51:34,144 --> 00:51:36,578
Hello.

1042
00:51:36,646 --> 00:51:38,546
Oh, hi Gerry,
you just caught me,

1043
00:51:38,615 --> 00:51:41,778
just been down to Kent
for a game of golf.

1044
00:51:41,851 --> 00:51:44,081
Who?

1045
00:51:44,154 --> 00:51:46,748
Well, what do I know about
Environmental Health?

1046
00:51:46,823 --> 00:51:48,313
I just drive your meat around

1047
00:51:48,391 --> 00:51:49,688
it's none of my business.

1048
00:51:49,759 --> 00:51:52,557
I've had the police
here and the man's wife,

1049
00:51:52,629 --> 00:51:54,722
making all sorts
of crazy allegations.

1050
00:51:54,798 --> 00:51:56,129
You can't have
hysterical women

1051
00:51:56,199 --> 00:51:57,291
running around the place,

1052
00:51:57,367 --> 00:51:58,265
it's not safe, is it?

1053
00:51:58,334 --> 00:51:59,460
Hang on a minute.

1054
00:51:59,536 --> 00:52:01,094
Joop,

1055
00:52:01,171 --> 00:52:03,469
you drive the cargo
over to Amsterdam,

1056
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,405
when you get
there stay for a bit.

1057
00:52:05,475 --> 00:52:07,670
I'll give you a call when
I want you back here.

1058
00:52:07,744 --> 00:52:08,506
Okay?

1059
00:52:08,578 --> 00:52:09,704
Okay.

1060
00:52:11,214 --> 00:52:13,876
Yeah, Gerry, listen if
this bloke's done a runner,

1061
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:15,110
he's probably
got good reason.

1062
00:52:15,185 --> 00:52:17,881
His wife sounds bonkers.

1063
00:52:17,954 --> 00:52:19,751
You take care now.

1064
00:52:19,823 --> 00:52:20,687
I've got to go.

1065
00:52:20,757 --> 00:52:22,952
Another round
of golf at the club.

1066
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:53,054
I had hoped that you
were going to tell me

1067
00:52:53,123 --> 00:52:56,786
that this wasn't his.

1068
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:59,886
That his had a hallmark.

1069
00:53:13,676 --> 00:53:16,804
We went on a

1070
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,144
package tour to Mexico,

1071
00:53:19,215 --> 00:53:23,276
the year before
we were married.

1072
00:53:23,353 --> 00:53:24,479
Warren had the
rings made there

1073
00:53:24,554 --> 00:53:26,249
from the same piece of gold.

1074
00:53:29,259 --> 00:53:31,625
He said it would remind us

1075
00:53:31,694 --> 00:53:35,255
that some people look for
El Dorado all their lives,

1076
00:53:35,331 --> 00:53:37,731
and never find it,

1077
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:43,933
and that we had found it
just by meeting each other.

1078
00:53:48,745 --> 00:53:50,542
I said it was because
it was half the price

1079
00:53:50,613 --> 00:53:54,014
he'd have paid in England.

1080
00:54:02,892 --> 00:54:05,656
I'm going to have to
take some fingerprints

1081
00:54:05,728 --> 00:54:07,161
from the house here,

1082
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:10,597
in order to confirm identity.

1083
00:54:10,667 --> 00:54:13,465
I'm not afraid
to identify him.

1084
00:54:16,105 --> 00:54:20,132
It's not that
straightforward.

1085
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:22,872
I understand.

1086
00:54:22,946 --> 00:54:28,145
But I'd still like
to say goodbye.

1087
00:54:28,218 --> 00:54:31,745
There's no easy
way to say this,

1088
00:54:31,821 --> 00:54:36,918
but we don't have your
husband's body to identify.

1089
00:54:36,993 --> 00:54:39,621
All we have is...

1090
00:55:04,554 --> 00:55:07,250
(Doorbell)

1091
00:55:08,191 --> 00:55:09,852
Open the door.

1092
00:55:09,926 --> 00:55:11,518
I'm looking for
a Mr. Allen Deering.

1093
00:55:11,594 --> 00:55:13,255
I'm Detective
Inspector Frost,

1094
00:55:13,329 --> 00:55:14,796
Denton CID.

1095
00:55:14,864 --> 00:55:15,888
I think there
must be a mistake.

1096
00:55:15,965 --> 00:55:17,455
Is your husband at
home, Mrs. Deering?

1097
00:55:17,533 --> 00:55:18,659
Yes, but I don't think...

1098
00:55:18,735 --> 00:55:19,565
All right.

1099
00:55:19,636 --> 00:55:21,297
I think you ought to take
the children upstairs.

1100
00:55:21,371 --> 00:55:22,429
Marjory, what is it?

1101
00:55:22,505 --> 00:55:23,631
I don't know Allen.

1102
00:55:23,706 --> 00:55:25,071
What is this?

1103
00:55:25,141 --> 00:55:26,165
Mr. Allen Deering?

1104
00:55:26,242 --> 00:55:28,073
Yes, I'm Allen Deering.

1105
00:55:28,144 --> 00:55:29,008
What do you think you are...

1106
00:55:29,078 --> 00:55:30,568
I want all
Mr. Deering's clothing

1107
00:55:30,647 --> 00:55:32,478
taken for
forensic examination

1108
00:55:32,548 --> 00:55:34,277
including his dirty laundry.

1109
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:36,147
I also want his car searched

1110
00:55:36,219 --> 00:55:37,811
and sealed for investigation.

1111
00:55:37,887 --> 00:55:38,945
You can't do this!

1112
00:55:39,022 --> 00:55:40,182
You can't just walk in here

1113
00:55:40,256 --> 00:55:41,587
without some kind of warrant.

1114
00:55:41,658 --> 00:55:43,751
Oh, yes I can, Mr. Deering.

1115
00:55:43,826 --> 00:55:46,852
I am entitled to
seize anything I want
on these premises

1116
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:49,763
if it relates to an offence
which I am investigating

1117
00:55:49,832 --> 00:55:52,426
and I find it
necessary to seize it

1118
00:55:52,502 --> 00:55:54,231
in order to prevent
it being concealed,

1119
00:55:54,304 --> 00:55:57,762
Iost, altered,
damaged or destroyed.

1120
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,637
What sort of
gobbledygook is that?

1121
00:55:59,709 --> 00:56:03,076
The correct gobbledygook.

1122
00:56:03,146 --> 00:56:06,343
What offence, for God's sake!

1123
00:56:06,416 --> 00:56:07,974
I'm investigating the death

1124
00:56:08,051 --> 00:56:10,679
of a young woman
called Jane Owens.

1125
00:56:10,753 --> 00:56:11,981
Who was last seen

1126
00:56:12,055 --> 00:56:14,023
getting into your
car two nights ago,

1127
00:56:14,090 --> 00:56:20,859
when you stopped to pick up
a prostitute in Bedford Park.

1128
00:56:20,930 --> 00:56:24,024
Now I'm sure you don't want
to discuss the matter here,

1129
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,728
so Denton Police
Station, Mr. Deering.

1130
00:56:26,803 --> 00:56:29,465
I'd like to make a start.

1131
00:56:36,379 --> 00:56:38,347
There is no doubt
about identification.

1132
00:56:38,414 --> 00:56:40,507
A number of women
saw Jane Owens

1133
00:56:40,583 --> 00:56:42,107
get into your car.

1134
00:56:42,185 --> 00:56:43,846
Whores.

1135
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,150
You think that what a bunch
of whores have got to say

1136
00:56:46,222 --> 00:56:47,086
is going to...

1137
00:56:47,156 --> 00:56:48,123
Mr. Deering,

1138
00:56:48,191 --> 00:56:50,819
we have traffic cameras
that saw your car on a loop

1139
00:56:50,893 --> 00:56:54,124
from the bypass
round to Bedford Park.

1140
00:56:54,197 --> 00:56:55,721
You went round six times,

1141
00:56:55,798 --> 00:56:56,924
now can you explain that?

1142
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,026
We all know what
goes on up there.

1143
00:57:02,205 --> 00:57:05,936
Mr. Deering
refuses to respond.

1144
00:57:06,009 --> 00:57:08,569
The women know you.

1145
00:57:08,644 --> 00:57:10,544
They know your car.

1146
00:57:10,613 --> 00:57:11,807
You drive up and
down that road

1147
00:57:11,881 --> 00:57:13,075
several times a month.

1148
00:57:13,149 --> 00:57:14,639
What do you think
they are, blind?

1149
00:57:14,717 --> 00:57:16,582
Same man, same car.

1150
00:57:16,652 --> 00:57:17,983
I've driven up there.

1151
00:57:18,054 --> 00:57:19,351
I've looked.

1152
00:57:19,422 --> 00:57:20,719
That's all.

1153
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:22,451
A few times.

1154
00:57:22,525 --> 00:57:24,015
I don't know why really,

1155
00:57:24,093 --> 00:57:25,720
it was stupid,

1156
00:57:25,795 --> 00:57:26,352
I didn't...

1157
00:57:26,429 --> 00:57:29,125
Mr. Deering, it would
not be true to say

1158
00:57:29,198 --> 00:57:31,359
that all you did was look.

1159
00:57:31,434 --> 00:57:32,628
That's all.

1160
00:57:32,702 --> 00:57:33,669
I swear it.

1161
00:57:33,736 --> 00:57:34,430
Really?

1162
00:57:34,504 --> 00:57:36,335
Then why did you stop
and pick up Jane Owens?

1163
00:57:36,406 --> 00:57:38,203
I didn't stop.

1164
00:57:38,274 --> 00:57:39,935
I have never stopped.

1165
00:57:40,009 --> 00:57:41,033
Oh, yes you have.

1166
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:43,578
And when you've stopped
it's always for someone

1167
00:57:43,646 --> 00:57:45,136
who looks like a young girl.

1168
00:57:45,214 --> 00:57:46,146
Very young.

1169
00:57:46,215 --> 00:57:47,273
I don't have
to listen to this!

1170
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:49,682
Yes you do.

1171
00:57:49,752 --> 00:57:51,481
Because I know you
picked up Jane Owens.

1172
00:57:51,554 --> 00:57:54,318
I've got witnesses.

1173
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:59,726
And three hours
later she was dead.

1174
00:57:59,796 --> 00:58:02,993
Now what have you
got to say about that?

1175
00:58:06,135 --> 00:58:07,898
Mr. Deering refuses to...

1176
00:58:07,970 --> 00:58:09,528
All right.

1177
00:58:09,605 --> 00:58:11,004
There was a girl.

1178
00:58:11,074 --> 00:58:13,008
I did pick her up.

1179
00:58:13,076 --> 00:58:14,771
It was a mistake.

1180
00:58:14,844 --> 00:58:16,334
We drove off.

1181
00:58:16,412 --> 00:58:18,539
I knew that I
shouldn't have done it.

1182
00:58:18,614 --> 00:58:21,174
I just dropped her off,

1183
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:27,086
I said that I'd
changed my mind.

1184
00:58:27,156 --> 00:58:28,748
You didn't hit her?

1185
00:58:28,825 --> 00:58:32,625
Of course I didn't.

1186
00:58:32,695 --> 00:58:35,687
Oh, yes you did, Mr. Deering.

1187
00:58:35,765 --> 00:58:37,960
You hit her.

1188
00:58:38,034 --> 00:58:41,435
Let's be blunt about it.

1189
00:58:41,504 --> 00:58:43,904
She was a sixteen
year old child

1190
00:58:43,973 --> 00:58:47,067
and you beat the
hell out of her.

1191
00:58:47,143 --> 00:58:50,044
Jack, Jack, Jack,
come on, come on, come on.

1192
00:58:50,113 --> 00:58:52,775
Yes, all right, okay.

1193
00:59:21,077 --> 00:59:23,409
Ryan, was he nervous
when you spoke to him?

1194
00:59:23,479 --> 00:59:24,503
Uncomfortable.

1195
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,126
What about the alibi?

1196
00:59:25,201 --> 00:59:27,032
He was definitely
at home that evening.

1197
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:28,161
All right.

1198
00:59:32,509 --> 00:59:34,170
So what happens here then?

1199
00:59:34,244 --> 00:59:35,336
The animals are cut up

1200
00:59:35,412 --> 00:59:37,107
and then carted off
to the supermarket.

1201
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:38,078
Is that it?

1202
00:59:38,148 --> 00:59:39,479
Oh, no, it's a bit
more than that, Jack.

1203
00:59:39,549 --> 00:59:41,107
Ryan's in partnership
with this bloke,

1204
00:59:41,184 --> 00:59:43,243
Jim Scott, hauler.

1205
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,720
This is one of
his trucks, here.

1206
00:59:47,824 --> 00:59:49,189
They export to Europe.

1207
00:59:49,259 --> 00:59:51,227
Mostly lamb, pork,

1208
00:59:51,294 --> 00:59:54,422
it's processed
and chilled here.

1209
00:59:54,497 --> 00:59:55,896
So, was anybody here

1210
00:59:55,966 --> 00:59:58,764
the night that
Barber was killed?

1211
00:59:58,835 --> 01:00:00,029
According to Ryan, no,

1212
01:00:00,103 --> 01:00:02,162
nobody here after
about seven O' clock.

1213
01:00:02,238 --> 01:00:03,705
He was here with Scott

1214
01:00:03,773 --> 01:00:05,434
and Ryan locked
up when they left,

1215
01:00:05,508 --> 01:00:07,499
separate cars but
at the same time.

1216
01:00:12,449 --> 01:00:16,044
Tell me, if someone
wanted to break into
this place at night,

1217
01:00:16,119 --> 01:00:17,313
would it be difficult?

1218
01:00:17,387 --> 01:00:19,184
Not that difficult I suppose.

1219
01:00:19,255 --> 01:00:21,155
Why, no real security?

1220
01:00:21,224 --> 01:00:23,658
Well, when I say
someone could get in,

1221
01:00:23,727 --> 01:00:24,591
I don't mean a truck

1222
01:00:24,661 --> 01:00:25,821
I mean just someone
on their own.

1223
01:00:25,895 --> 01:00:27,658
We've got alarms.

1224
01:00:27,731 --> 01:00:28,993
But if a bloke got round them,

1225
01:00:29,065 --> 01:00:30,498
Iugged a side of
meat over the fence,

1226
01:00:30,567 --> 01:00:32,091
well, good luck to him.

1227
01:00:32,168 --> 01:00:34,068
I bet he wouldn't
go back for two.

1228
01:00:34,137 --> 01:00:35,661
Tell me,

1229
01:00:35,739 --> 01:00:37,434
what was it that Mr. Barber

1230
01:00:37,507 --> 01:00:39,338
thought that you were up to?

1231
01:00:39,409 --> 01:00:42,173
He did think that you were
up to something clearly.

1232
01:00:42,245 --> 01:00:43,712
Don't ask me.

1233
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:45,304
He had it in for me,

1234
01:00:45,382 --> 01:00:47,680
and I don't pretend to have
taken very kindly to it.

1235
01:00:47,751 --> 01:00:49,582
But this place is clean.

1236
01:00:49,653 --> 01:00:53,248
We have a meat and hygiene
inspector here full time.

1237
01:00:53,323 --> 01:00:56,190
I know about the night of
Mr. Barber's disappearance.

1238
01:00:56,259 --> 01:00:59,092
What about the following day?

1239
01:00:59,162 --> 01:01:01,426
The day after?

1240
01:01:01,498 --> 01:01:03,329
Yes, the day after.

1241
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:06,858
That would be
the following day.

1242
01:01:06,936 --> 01:01:08,494
You see Sergeant Toolan here

1243
01:01:08,571 --> 01:01:11,631
didn't have the full details
when he spoke to you last.

1244
01:01:11,708 --> 01:01:15,542
He didn't know that
we'd found Mr. Barber.

1245
01:01:15,612 --> 01:01:17,136
Dead.

1246
01:01:19,482 --> 01:01:20,881
That's terrible.

1247
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:22,474
So, where were you

1248
01:01:22,552 --> 01:01:25,612
the following day?

1249
01:01:25,689 --> 01:01:27,213
I was out with Jim Scott.

1250
01:01:27,290 --> 01:01:28,621
What were you doing, working?

1251
01:01:28,692 --> 01:01:31,183
No, we were flying.

1252
01:01:31,261 --> 01:01:34,025
Jim's got a plane, a Cessna.

1253
01:01:34,097 --> 01:01:35,155
We were going to play golf

1254
01:01:35,231 --> 01:01:36,562
but we didn't
land in the end.

1255
01:01:36,633 --> 01:01:38,123
The weather closed in.

1256
01:01:38,201 --> 01:01:40,669
Do you often fly round the
country just to play golf?

1257
01:01:40,737 --> 01:01:42,034
Often enough.

1258
01:01:42,105 --> 01:01:45,006
Jim Scott's a golf fanatic.

1259
01:01:45,075 --> 01:01:46,804
Often thought about
doing that myself.

1260
01:01:46,876 --> 01:01:47,900
Not the golf thing,

1261
01:01:47,977 --> 01:01:49,239
the flying.

1262
01:01:49,312 --> 01:01:51,974
Must be a wonderful
feeling that, you know.

1263
01:01:52,048 --> 01:01:54,209
Being up there
above the clouds.

1264
01:01:54,284 --> 01:01:56,309
You know, no worries.

1265
01:01:56,386 --> 01:01:57,876
God's great creation

1266
01:01:57,954 --> 01:01:59,478
spread out beneath you.

1267
01:01:59,556 --> 01:02:01,649
Where did you go?

1268
01:02:01,725 --> 01:02:03,215
Up towards Norwich.

1269
01:02:03,293 --> 01:02:04,487
Now that's real freedom.

1270
01:02:04,561 --> 01:02:05,425
Oh, yeah.

1271
01:02:05,495 --> 01:02:09,989
Flying up high with
nowhere special to be, eh?

1272
01:02:10,066 --> 01:02:11,897
Well,

1273
01:02:11,968 --> 01:02:12,764
I tell you what

1274
01:02:12,836 --> 01:02:14,633
I don't know much
about this business,

1275
01:02:14,704 --> 01:02:15,932
but there are those who say

1276
01:02:16,005 --> 01:02:17,233
that if you eat meat

1277
01:02:17,307 --> 01:02:18,865
then you shouldn't
be squeamish

1278
01:02:18,942 --> 01:02:21,968
about watching an animal
being killed and cut up.

1279
01:02:22,045 --> 01:02:24,172
Perhaps you'd like
to show me round?

1280
01:02:24,247 --> 01:02:25,942
I've got work
to do, Inspector.

1281
01:02:26,015 --> 01:02:28,142
So have I.

1282
01:02:28,218 --> 01:02:29,685
That's why I'm here.

1283
01:02:35,492 --> 01:02:38,154
So how did you
get into all this?

1284
01:02:38,228 --> 01:02:40,059
My father was a
butcher in Ireland.

1285
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:42,291
I came here to get
away from all that,

1286
01:02:42,365 --> 01:02:44,060
but I started doing odd jobs,

1287
01:02:44,134 --> 01:02:46,227
making more
money than I expected.

1288
01:02:46,302 --> 01:02:48,202
I ended up managing
a rundown slaughterhouse

1289
01:02:48,271 --> 01:02:49,465
by the old cattle market.

1290
01:02:49,539 --> 01:02:51,598
Oh yes, I know, that's all
gone now though, hasn't it?

1291
01:02:51,674 --> 01:02:53,972
Most of the business
has gone with it.

1292
01:02:54,043 --> 01:02:55,374
But I built up new trade

1293
01:02:55,445 --> 01:02:57,208
and eventually
I moved over here.

1294
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,542
What about this
partner of yours?

1295
01:02:58,615 --> 01:03:00,173
What's his name, Scott?

1296
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:01,547
I've got a lot
of meat to shift.

1297
01:03:01,618 --> 01:03:03,518
He's got a fleet of
refrigerated trucks

1298
01:03:03,586 --> 01:03:05,178
and contacts in Europe.

1299
01:03:07,924 --> 01:03:09,824
That reminds me.

1300
01:03:09,893 --> 01:03:13,056
I never told you how
we found Mr. Barber, did I?

1301
01:03:13,129 --> 01:03:15,723
Well, the bit of him we found.

1302
01:03:15,799 --> 01:03:17,528
It was enough though.

1303
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,465
You see his body
had been dismembered.

1304
01:03:19,536 --> 01:03:22,528
No, that's not quite
the right word, is it?

1305
01:03:22,605 --> 01:03:25,096
He had been cut up actually.

1306
01:03:25,175 --> 01:03:26,233
You won't mind

1307
01:03:26,309 --> 01:03:28,675
shutting down this place
for the day, will you?

1308
01:03:28,745 --> 01:03:30,872
What do you mean?

1309
01:03:30,947 --> 01:03:32,881
I'm sending in
a forensic team,

1310
01:03:32,949 --> 01:03:35,179
to examine this lot.

1311
01:03:44,294 --> 01:03:48,128
George, I'm going off to have
a word with this Jim Scott.

1312
01:03:48,198 --> 01:03:50,428
I want you to wait here
until forensic arrives.

1313
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:51,694
I've already
given them a call.

1314
01:03:51,768 --> 01:03:53,463
Ryan's shutting
up shop for the day.

1315
01:03:53,536 --> 01:03:55,561
Just make sure nothing
leaves the place, will you?

1316
01:03:55,638 --> 01:03:57,970
Forensic why,
what have you got?

1317
01:03:58,041 --> 01:03:58,939
Think about it.

1318
01:03:59,008 --> 01:03:59,940
We've got a butchery,

1319
01:04:00,009 --> 01:04:01,237
a butchered body,

1320
01:04:01,311 --> 01:04:03,472
and the means of delivering
the pieces to the north sea

1321
01:04:03,546 --> 01:04:05,377
without the aid
of extra terrestrials.

1322
01:04:05,448 --> 01:04:06,779
Well, okay, a
plane would solve that,

1323
01:04:06,850 --> 01:04:07,839
but where's the motive?

1324
01:04:07,917 --> 01:04:08,906
Well I don't know, do I?

1325
01:04:08,985 --> 01:04:10,543
Maybe Barber found
what he was looking for.

1326
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:12,884
Anyway, just
keep your eyes open.

1327
01:04:21,497 --> 01:04:22,122
Come on!

1328
01:04:22,198 --> 01:04:22,892
Come here!

1329
01:04:22,966 --> 01:04:23,830
Come on, we've got to go.

1330
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:24,889
Come on, where are you?

1331
01:04:26,636 --> 01:04:27,762
Come on!

1332
01:04:27,837 --> 01:04:29,702
Kai.

1333
01:04:29,772 --> 01:04:31,034
Heel!

1334
01:04:31,107 --> 01:04:31,766
Come on!

1335
01:04:31,841 --> 01:04:32,398
Heel!

1336
01:04:32,475 --> 01:04:33,407
Heel!

1337
01:04:33,476 --> 01:04:35,273
One word from you, eh?

1338
01:04:35,345 --> 01:04:39,748
You ever tried feeding him.

1339
01:04:39,816 --> 01:04:41,374
I don't know.

1340
01:04:41,451 --> 01:04:43,282
You're like a kid in a
candy store, aren't you?

1341
01:04:43,353 --> 01:04:44,251
Will you come on!

1342
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:44,945
Hey, Kai!

1343
01:04:45,021 --> 01:04:46,716
Come on!

1344
01:04:46,789 --> 01:04:50,281
You've got to admire the way
these police dogs are trained.

1345
01:04:52,395 --> 01:04:52,884
Come on!

1346
01:04:52,962 --> 01:04:53,951
Come on!

1347
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:05,498
Is tomorrow soon enough?

1348
01:05:05,575 --> 01:05:08,237
No, tomorrow won't be
bloody soon enough at all.

1349
01:05:10,246 --> 01:05:11,679
So you spent
the evening alone.

1350
01:05:11,748 --> 01:05:12,680
Yeah, I watched television,

1351
01:05:12,749 --> 01:05:14,614
had something to eat, a couple
of whiskeys went to bed.

1352
01:05:14,684 --> 01:05:15,742
If I'd known you'd
wanted an alibi

1353
01:05:15,818 --> 01:05:17,115
I'd have arranged something.

1354
01:05:17,186 --> 01:05:18,346
Do you live on
your own do you?

1355
01:05:18,421 --> 01:05:20,981
Yeah, me and the
wife are divorced.

1356
01:05:21,057 --> 01:05:22,217
Look,

1357
01:05:22,292 --> 01:05:24,021
I left the factory with Gerry.

1358
01:05:24,093 --> 01:05:25,117
I drove out before him,

1359
01:05:25,194 --> 01:05:28,186
he was behind me on
the bypass for miles.

1360
01:05:28,264 --> 01:05:29,356
But you could have gone back.

1361
01:05:29,432 --> 01:05:30,126
You had a set of keys.

1362
01:05:30,199 --> 01:05:31,530
I didn't go back.

1363
01:05:34,003 --> 01:05:35,436
And as for this man Barber.

1364
01:05:35,505 --> 01:05:37,973
I'd never heard
of him till yesterday.

1365
01:05:38,041 --> 01:05:40,305
If I wanted to murder
a government inspector,

1366
01:05:40,376 --> 01:05:43,573
I'd go looking at the Ministry
of Transport, wouldn't I?

1367
01:05:43,646 --> 01:05:46,137
You find Mr. Barber's death
amusing then, do you?

1368
01:05:46,215 --> 01:05:47,204
No, of course not.

1369
01:05:47,283 --> 01:05:49,410
I'm just running out
of ways of telling you

1370
01:05:49,485 --> 01:05:51,544
I don't know
anything about it.

1371
01:05:51,621 --> 01:05:55,819
Only the circumstances
of his death are peculiar.

1372
01:05:55,892 --> 01:05:58,656
In particular
about where he died

1373
01:05:58,728 --> 01:06:00,719
and where we found his arm.

1374
01:06:00,797 --> 01:06:02,765
Oh it is his arm, by the way,

1375
01:06:02,832 --> 01:06:05,323
we've identified
his fingerprints.

1376
01:06:05,401 --> 01:06:08,427
Well, I can't
say I knew the man.

1377
01:06:08,504 --> 01:06:13,271
But obviously a tragedy
like this, it's awful.

1378
01:06:13,343 --> 01:06:15,072
Was it an accident
of some kind?

1379
01:06:15,144 --> 01:06:16,941
Less of an accident,

1380
01:06:17,013 --> 01:06:19,538
more like a ruddy miracle.

1381
01:06:19,615 --> 01:06:21,105
A miracle?

1382
01:06:21,184 --> 01:06:23,084
I'm not with you
there, Inspector.

1383
01:06:23,152 --> 01:06:25,313
Well, it's very
possible that he did die

1384
01:06:25,388 --> 01:06:27,413
within or around Denton.

1385
01:06:27,490 --> 01:06:31,290
But then he turned up some
hours later in the north sea.

1386
01:06:31,361 --> 01:06:33,261
In pieces.

1387
01:06:33,329 --> 01:06:35,695
They do say that
souls sprout wings,

1388
01:06:35,765 --> 01:06:39,861
his gave up
somewhere around Hull.

1389
01:06:39,936 --> 01:06:42,905
If this is your sense of
humor, Inspector Frost,

1390
01:06:42,972 --> 01:06:45,270
I really don't understand it.

1391
01:06:45,341 --> 01:06:48,674
No, neither does
my superintendent.

1392
01:06:48,745 --> 01:06:50,144
Tell me about your plane?

1393
01:06:50,213 --> 01:06:51,237
Oh my god,

1394
01:06:51,314 --> 01:06:54,112
it's alibi time again.

1395
01:06:54,183 --> 01:06:57,641
Cos I think it's time
I took a closer look at it.

1396
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,585
A fine tooth comb
is what I had in mind,

1397
01:06:59,655 --> 01:07:01,919
with forensic
on the other end.

1398
01:07:01,991 --> 01:07:04,459
This is getting out
of hand, Inspector.

1399
01:07:04,527 --> 01:07:08,623
That's after they've been
to the factory, of course.

1400
01:07:08,698 --> 01:07:09,892
Now you can believe this

1401
01:07:09,966 --> 01:07:12,025
or believe it not.

1402
01:07:12,101 --> 01:07:14,365
But every knife or saw

1403
01:07:14,437 --> 01:07:16,598
has it's own signature.

1404
01:07:16,672 --> 01:07:18,333
Something unique

1405
01:07:18,408 --> 01:07:20,103
and a weapon
can be identified

1406
01:07:20,176 --> 01:07:23,805
by the mark
it leaves on a wound,

1407
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:26,041
or on a cut.

1408
01:07:40,363 --> 01:07:45,528
Gerry, Jim's called in,

1409
01:07:45,601 --> 01:07:46,932
I think I should
get you out of there

1410
01:07:47,003 --> 01:07:49,335
before you do
yourself an injury.

1411
01:07:49,405 --> 01:07:51,430
Will you stay for
something to eat, Jim?

1412
01:07:51,507 --> 01:07:53,475
No, it's just business.

1413
01:07:53,543 --> 01:07:55,704
I won't keep him long.

1414
01:08:05,121 --> 01:08:08,022
We'd better talk
then eh, Gerry.

1415
01:08:08,091 --> 01:08:11,356
Well, forensic have
used everything they
can find at Ryan's.

1416
01:08:11,427 --> 01:08:13,691
If it cuts they've tested it.

1417
01:08:13,763 --> 01:08:15,287
On pigs.

1418
01:08:15,364 --> 01:08:16,490
Apparently their skin's

1419
01:08:16,566 --> 01:08:18,193
the closest to human flesh.

1420
01:08:18,267 --> 01:08:20,428
Well, looking at
you I can believe it.

1421
01:08:20,503 --> 01:08:22,869
But the top of
the arm's too damaged

1422
01:08:22,939 --> 01:08:26,136
to make
comparisons conclusive.

1423
01:08:26,209 --> 01:08:27,676
Does that mean they
can't even tell us

1424
01:08:27,743 --> 01:08:30,075
that it was meat cutting
equipment that was used?

1425
01:08:30,146 --> 01:08:32,011
No, not even that.

1426
01:08:32,081 --> 01:08:34,015
Uhh, come on.

1427
01:08:34,083 --> 01:08:35,641
The cut was
probably a lot cleaner

1428
01:08:35,718 --> 01:08:37,049
when the arm
went into the water

1429
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:38,747
but that's down to crabs.

1430
01:08:38,821 --> 01:08:39,879
You what?

1431
01:08:39,956 --> 01:08:42,288
They were in the
process of eating it.

1432
01:08:45,595 --> 01:08:47,426
Are you telling me you don't
know anything about this?

1433
01:08:47,497 --> 01:08:49,795
You're telling me Barber
didn't break into the place?

1434
01:08:49,866 --> 01:08:52,164
I don't believe you.

1435
01:08:52,235 --> 01:08:53,259
All right, Gerry.

1436
01:08:53,336 --> 01:08:54,963
If you really want to know,

1437
01:08:55,037 --> 01:08:55,867
I'll tell you.

1438
01:08:55,938 --> 01:08:57,929
Yes you're
environmental officer

1439
01:08:58,007 --> 01:09:00,339
decided to do a little
bit of undercover work.

1440
01:09:00,409 --> 01:09:01,967
Your fault.

1441
01:09:02,044 --> 01:09:04,569
You can't even run a straight
operation convincingly.

1442
01:09:04,647 --> 01:09:05,944
What happened?

1443
01:09:06,015 --> 01:09:07,004
He got in.

1444
01:09:07,083 --> 01:09:10,382
Joop and I were just about
to start moving the stuff.

1445
01:09:10,453 --> 01:09:11,750
We spotted him, he ran,

1446
01:09:11,821 --> 01:09:12,879
we got him outside.

1447
01:09:12,955 --> 01:09:14,047
We didn't know who he was,

1448
01:09:14,123 --> 01:09:14,919
how much he knew.

1449
01:09:14,991 --> 01:09:15,855
Joop knocked him out,

1450
01:09:15,925 --> 01:09:17,756
we took him back in and...

1451
01:09:17,827 --> 01:09:20,022
And what?

1452
01:09:20,096 --> 01:09:22,792
He ended up dead.

1453
01:09:22,865 --> 01:09:24,162
You've been a
front for this stuff

1454
01:09:24,233 --> 01:09:27,430
coming into the country
for nearly ten years.

1455
01:09:27,503 --> 01:09:29,801
They'll put you away
a long time for it

1456
01:09:29,872 --> 01:09:30,964
so just remember that

1457
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,270
and keep your gob shut.

1458
01:09:33,342 --> 01:09:35,139
I'm not getting
in any deeper, Jim.

1459
01:09:35,211 --> 01:09:37,543
You're in this as
deep as I am Gerry,

1460
01:09:37,613 --> 01:09:38,443
and if it blows up,

1461
01:09:38,514 --> 01:09:41,506
don't think the police is all
you've got to worry about.

1462
01:09:41,584 --> 01:09:43,484
Cheers.

1463
01:09:51,761 --> 01:09:52,455
I don't know,

1464
01:09:52,528 --> 01:09:53,790
some bloke sees
a plane go off,

1465
01:09:53,863 --> 01:09:55,558
another bloke sees
a plane come back.

1466
01:09:55,631 --> 01:09:57,826
Scott writes a few notes
in a book about the weather

1467
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:59,128
and that's it.

1468
01:09:59,202 --> 01:10:00,362
I mean I thought flying

1469
01:10:00,436 --> 01:10:01,835
was supposed to be
like brain surgery.

1470
01:10:01,904 --> 01:10:03,895
Well, it's hardly
Concorde, is it?

1471
01:10:03,973 --> 01:10:05,600
Is there anything
on the mileage?

1472
01:10:05,675 --> 01:10:08,303
Well we can probably
show the total distance

1473
01:10:08,377 --> 01:10:09,366
could have taken them

1474
01:10:09,445 --> 01:10:10,810
to the North Coast of
Lincolnshire and back

1475
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,245
but that doesn't
prove they did it.

1476
01:10:12,315 --> 01:10:14,340
There has to be some way
of tracking them surely.

1477
01:10:14,417 --> 01:10:16,180
There was a lot of cloud.

1478
01:10:16,252 --> 01:10:18,516
If they stayed in that they
wouldn't have been seen.

1479
01:10:18,588 --> 01:10:19,885
If they'd have
kept radio silence.

1480
01:10:19,956 --> 01:10:21,287
Have you been down
that library again,

1481
01:10:21,357 --> 01:10:22,415
Sergeant, or what?

1482
01:10:22,491 --> 01:10:25,187
All I'm saying is what we end
up with is a possible plane,

1483
01:10:25,261 --> 01:10:26,751
in a possible area,

1484
01:10:26,829 --> 01:10:28,956
that might have
been Scott's plane

1485
01:10:29,031 --> 01:10:30,760
or might not.

1486
01:10:30,833 --> 01:10:31,663
All right.

1487
01:10:31,734 --> 01:10:33,998
What about forensic?

1488
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:36,470
I think you'd better
have a word there, Jack.

1489
01:10:45,147 --> 01:10:46,842
Okay, okay, I know
what you're after.

1490
01:10:46,916 --> 01:10:47,848
Come on.

1491
01:10:49,385 --> 01:10:50,579
Here you are.

1492
01:10:50,653 --> 01:10:51,483
Come on.

1493
01:10:51,554 --> 01:10:52,851
Here.

1494
01:10:52,922 --> 01:10:54,412
Hey, what are you doing?

1495
01:10:54,490 --> 01:10:56,617
I've already given
him his breakfast.

1496
01:10:56,692 --> 01:10:59,252
Oh, he was asking,

1497
01:10:59,328 --> 01:11:01,694
I thought you hadn't.

1498
01:11:01,764 --> 01:11:03,755
Hey, a devious
little devil you are,

1499
01:11:03,833 --> 01:11:04,857
come on, down.

1500
01:11:04,934 --> 01:11:07,027
No, get down!

1501
01:11:07,103 --> 01:11:09,094
Really!

1502
01:11:09,171 --> 01:11:11,799
Anyway, that's the last laugh
you're going to get today.

1503
01:11:14,043 --> 01:11:17,012
Forensic have
come up with nothing.

1504
01:11:17,079 --> 01:11:19,570
No human blood,
hairs or fibres.

1505
01:11:19,649 --> 01:11:21,014
All very tidy.

1506
01:11:21,083 --> 01:11:23,813
He must have been
very well wrapped.

1507
01:11:23,886 --> 01:11:25,547
We know exactly
what happened

1508
01:11:25,621 --> 01:11:29,785
and we've got exactly
nothing to make it stick.

1509
01:11:29,859 --> 01:11:31,554
(Phone ringing)

1510
01:11:31,627 --> 01:11:33,094
Yes, CID?

1511
01:11:35,431 --> 01:11:37,831
Yeah.

1512
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:39,265
Yeah, okay.

1513
01:11:41,237 --> 01:11:42,966
Yeah okay,
thanks I'll tell him.

1514
01:11:45,474 --> 01:11:49,137
Mr. and Mrs. Owens
are off back to Wales.

1515
01:11:49,211 --> 01:11:51,270
Jane's body
has been released.

1516
01:11:51,347 --> 01:11:55,943
Her brother's come down
from Leeds to pick them up.

1517
01:11:56,018 --> 01:11:58,248
I suppose I'd better go
over there and say something,

1518
01:11:58,321 --> 01:12:01,722
though I don't know
what I'm going to say.

1519
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:03,656
He must have beaten her up.

1520
01:12:03,726 --> 01:12:05,557
Of course he beat her up.

1521
01:12:08,264 --> 01:12:10,391
That's where he stopped,

1522
01:12:10,466 --> 01:12:14,425
because my gut feeling
tells me he didn't kill her.

1523
01:12:14,503 --> 01:12:16,562
Then how did she die?

1524
01:12:19,375 --> 01:12:20,535
Jack?

1525
01:12:20,609 --> 01:12:22,236
I've got a Mrs. Waldren here,

1526
01:12:22,311 --> 01:12:24,905
information about Jane Owens.

1527
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:26,311
Did she see her that night?

1528
01:12:26,382 --> 01:12:28,816
No, this is two
days before she died.

1529
01:12:28,884 --> 01:12:30,351
She saw her
having an argument

1530
01:12:30,419 --> 01:12:32,853
with a bloke in a black car.

1531
01:12:32,922 --> 01:12:34,651
A BMW.

1532
01:12:35,791 --> 01:12:36,723
Come on.

1533
01:12:38,761 --> 01:12:39,625
Stay Kai!

1534
01:12:44,133 --> 01:12:45,122
Yes.

1535
01:12:47,503 --> 01:12:48,902
All right, thank you.

1536
01:12:50,005 --> 01:12:51,404
As soon as I saw the picture

1537
01:12:51,474 --> 01:12:53,339
I knew it was the same girl.

1538
01:12:53,409 --> 01:12:55,877
I stopped and asked her if
she was all right, you see.

1539
01:12:57,847 --> 01:13:00,111
Let me get this straight.

1540
01:13:00,182 --> 01:13:02,343
You said that this happened

1541
01:13:02,418 --> 01:13:05,410
on the Wednesday 27th.

1542
01:13:05,488 --> 01:13:06,978
It couldn't have
been a mistake.

1543
01:13:07,056 --> 01:13:09,889
It couldn't have happened
like the next day?

1544
01:13:09,959 --> 01:13:10,550
No.

1545
01:13:10,626 --> 01:13:12,025
No.

1546
01:13:13,396 --> 01:13:14,385
I'm sorry.

1547
01:13:14,463 --> 01:13:16,488
Please carry on.

1548
01:13:16,565 --> 01:13:19,728
I'd been cycling
down by the canal,

1549
01:13:19,802 --> 01:13:22,794
and there was a car parked
in the old brickworks.

1550
01:13:22,872 --> 01:13:25,272
A BMW.

1551
01:13:25,341 --> 01:13:26,899
She was standing there.

1552
01:13:26,976 --> 01:13:29,444
A man was shouting at her.

1553
01:13:29,512 --> 01:13:31,537
As I cycled up to them

1554
01:13:31,614 --> 01:13:32,410
he was shaking her.

1555
01:13:32,481 --> 01:13:34,381
I thought he was
going to hit her.

1556
01:13:34,450 --> 01:13:36,918
As soon as he
saw me he stopped.

1557
01:13:36,986 --> 01:13:39,079
Did you hear any
of the argument?

1558
01:13:39,155 --> 01:13:40,486
No, nothing.

1559
01:13:43,826 --> 01:13:45,987
Did you get a good
look at the man?

1560
01:13:46,061 --> 01:13:47,426
Oh, yes.

1561
01:13:47,496 --> 01:13:48,656
I see.

1562
01:13:48,731 --> 01:13:50,460
How old would you say he was?

1563
01:13:50,533 --> 01:13:53,093
I don't know, 20, 22.

1564
01:13:56,806 --> 01:13:58,797
Are you sure?

1565
01:13:58,874 --> 01:14:00,671
Well, it's
difficult at that age.

1566
01:14:00,743 --> 01:14:03,109
I find more and more that
young people just look,

1567
01:14:03,179 --> 01:14:04,806
very young.

1568
01:14:08,884 --> 01:14:12,445
Did you speak to Jane?

1569
01:14:12,521 --> 01:14:15,319
I asked her if
she was all right.

1570
01:14:15,391 --> 01:14:17,120
She clearly wasn't,

1571
01:14:17,193 --> 01:14:19,320
but she wasn't
hurt or anything.

1572
01:14:19,395 --> 01:14:21,124
He'd driven off,

1573
01:14:21,197 --> 01:14:23,722
and she just went.

1574
01:14:23,799 --> 01:14:26,768
I could see how
she was living,

1575
01:14:26,836 --> 01:14:30,067
I felt...

1576
01:14:30,139 --> 01:14:33,597
but there's not really
anything you can do, is there?

1577
01:14:37,913 --> 01:14:39,175
No.

1578
01:14:40,816 --> 01:14:42,340
Well, thank you very
much Mrs. Waldren.

1579
01:14:42,418 --> 01:14:44,613
You've been a great help.

1580
01:14:44,687 --> 01:14:45,813
Sergeant Toolan here

1581
01:14:45,888 --> 01:14:47,879
will take your statement
a little later on.

1582
01:14:47,957 --> 01:14:49,788
George, would
you come outside?

1583
01:14:54,964 --> 01:14:56,226
Well, it certainly
isn't Deering.

1584
01:14:56,298 --> 01:14:57,265
No.

1585
01:14:57,333 --> 01:15:01,463
It's also someone else you
wouldn't expect Jane to know.

1586
01:15:01,537 --> 01:15:03,869
Well heeled, expensive car.

1587
01:15:03,939 --> 01:15:05,930
Someone who's
about to attack her.

1588
01:15:06,008 --> 01:15:07,475
You think she was
lying to Rickie,

1589
01:15:07,543 --> 01:15:09,306
she was already on the game?

1590
01:15:09,378 --> 01:15:10,675
I don't know.

1591
01:15:10,746 --> 01:15:13,271
Find out all you
can about this bloke.

1592
01:15:13,349 --> 01:15:16,318
If Deering isn't the
reason why she's dead,

1593
01:15:16,385 --> 01:15:18,444
we've got another one.

1594
01:15:39,608 --> 01:15:40,836
Ah, there you are.

1595
01:15:40,910 --> 01:15:42,070
Where have you been?

1596
01:15:42,144 --> 01:15:43,270
There's a good boy.

1597
01:15:43,345 --> 01:15:44,107
Jack?

1598
01:15:44,179 --> 01:15:44,941
Yeah?

1599
01:15:45,014 --> 01:15:45,742
You want a lift?

1600
01:15:45,814 --> 01:15:46,838
Yeah, all right.

1601
01:15:46,916 --> 01:15:48,679
Mullett's on the warpath.

1602
01:15:48,751 --> 01:15:49,479
Oh, yeah?

1603
01:15:49,552 --> 01:15:51,144
What now?

1604
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:53,518
Forensic overtime.

1605
01:15:53,589 --> 01:15:55,352
Come on, good boy.

1606
01:15:57,860 --> 01:15:58,792
Good boy.

1607
01:16:07,436 --> 01:16:08,425
In the last two days

1608
01:16:08,504 --> 01:16:09,766
you've used up the allocation

1609
01:16:09,838 --> 01:16:11,203
for the next two months.

1610
01:16:11,273 --> 01:16:13,241
And still no results.

1611
01:16:13,309 --> 01:16:14,241
No.

1612
01:16:14,310 --> 01:16:16,608
Did you manage to get that
photo-fit from Mrs. Waldren?

1613
01:16:16,679 --> 01:16:19,011
Yes, it's in the
file by your feet.

1614
01:16:24,086 --> 01:16:25,883
You know he could be local.

1615
01:16:25,955 --> 01:16:28,048
There's something
about him I recognize.

1616
01:16:28,123 --> 01:16:31,092
Don't know what it is.

1617
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:32,525
I do.

1618
01:16:32,595 --> 01:16:35,189
But it's not
because he's local.

1619
01:16:35,264 --> 01:16:38,495
Remember the photos
Jane's parents brought?

1620
01:16:38,567 --> 01:16:40,660
I think I know who it is.

1621
01:16:49,445 --> 01:16:51,879
We're taking her home.

1622
01:16:51,947 --> 01:16:55,405
Yes, yes of course.

1623
01:16:55,484 --> 01:16:57,475
Well I'll say goodbye.

1624
01:16:57,553 --> 01:16:59,316
The Funeral Directors'
van's coming later.

1625
01:16:59,388 --> 01:17:01,015
Mark's driving us.

1626
01:17:01,090 --> 01:17:02,614
That's your son.

1627
01:17:02,691 --> 01:17:03,715
Where is he?

1628
01:17:03,792 --> 01:17:04,918
He's here.

1629
01:17:04,994 --> 01:17:06,723
Time we were off.

1630
01:17:06,795 --> 01:17:08,456
We'd best get our things.

1631
01:17:08,530 --> 01:17:09,690
We'll see you before we go?

1632
01:17:09,765 --> 01:17:11,130
Yes, of course.

1633
01:17:12,368 --> 01:17:13,960
You're Inspector Frost.

1634
01:17:14,036 --> 01:17:16,061
Yes.

1635
01:17:16,138 --> 01:17:18,402
And you're Mark,
Jane's brother.

1636
01:17:18,474 --> 01:17:19,406
Yes.

1637
01:17:19,475 --> 01:17:21,966
Look, thanks for all you've
done for Mum and Dad.

1638
01:17:22,044 --> 01:17:23,170
We still don't
know what happened

1639
01:17:23,245 --> 01:17:24,269
the man you're questioning,

1640
01:17:24,346 --> 01:17:25,779
do you think he
really killed her?

1641
01:17:25,848 --> 01:17:29,147
Well, all the evidence
points in that direction.

1642
01:17:29,218 --> 01:17:30,742
However,

1643
01:17:30,819 --> 01:17:33,652
I do have a witness
that puts you in Denton

1644
01:17:33,722 --> 01:17:34,848
with your sister Jane,

1645
01:17:34,923 --> 01:17:36,982
two days before she died?

1646
01:17:37,059 --> 01:17:39,084
Perhaps you'd like to tell me

1647
01:17:39,161 --> 01:17:41,186
why you failed to tell
the police about that,

1648
01:17:41,263 --> 01:17:42,696
Mr. Owens?

1649
01:17:47,970 --> 01:17:49,164
I dropped her
by an old factory.

1650
01:17:49,238 --> 01:17:50,671
She said she was living there.

1651
01:17:50,739 --> 01:17:51,706
Near a canal.

1652
01:17:51,774 --> 01:17:52,502
I drove off,

1653
01:17:52,574 --> 01:17:53,438
that was it,

1654
01:17:53,509 --> 01:17:54,567
we were arguing,

1655
01:17:54,643 --> 01:17:55,575
I was angry.

1656
01:17:55,644 --> 01:17:57,635
So two days later you
hear from your parents

1657
01:17:57,713 --> 01:18:00,648
that Jane has died
in circumstances

1658
01:18:00,716 --> 01:18:03,310
that require a
police investigation.

1659
01:18:03,385 --> 01:18:05,148
You don't tell them
that you've seen her

1660
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:07,347
and you don't
tell the police.

1661
01:18:07,423 --> 01:18:09,323
Would you describe
that as normal?

1662
01:18:09,391 --> 01:18:11,120
What was I going to say?

1663
01:18:11,193 --> 01:18:12,626
That my sister hitched
up to ask for money

1664
01:18:12,695 --> 01:18:15,186
and told her to piss off.

1665
01:18:15,264 --> 01:18:16,356
Look, if I hadn't said that,

1666
01:18:16,432 --> 01:18:17,456
if I'd tried to help,

1667
01:18:17,533 --> 01:18:18,795
maybe she'd still be here.

1668
01:18:18,867 --> 01:18:20,198
I still can't face
myself, Inspector,

1669
01:18:20,269 --> 01:18:21,167
Iet alone mum and dad.

1670
01:18:21,236 --> 01:18:22,726
You had contact with her.

1671
01:18:22,805 --> 01:18:24,102
You knew where she was,

1672
01:18:24,173 --> 01:18:26,607
despite what your
parents were going through.

1673
01:18:26,675 --> 01:18:28,666
How sick they were.

1674
01:18:28,744 --> 01:18:30,507
They were going
to London for days,

1675
01:18:30,579 --> 01:18:32,240
Iooking for her, everywhere.

1676
01:18:32,314 --> 01:18:34,305
And you let them
do that, knowing!

1677
01:18:34,383 --> 01:18:36,078
Look, the only time
she ever came near me

1678
01:18:36,151 --> 01:18:37,345
was when she wanted money.

1679
01:18:37,419 --> 01:18:39,444
She wouldn't let me tell them
what was happening to her.

1680
01:18:39,521 --> 01:18:40,783
I went along with it,
what else could I do?

1681
01:18:40,856 --> 01:18:43,120
Oh don't give me that.

1682
01:18:43,192 --> 01:18:44,887
They couldn't have
handled what she was.

1683
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:47,622
So you kept quiet for your
parents' sake, did you.

1684
01:18:47,696 --> 01:18:49,425
Despite what they
were going through.

1685
01:18:49,498 --> 01:18:50,829
I don't buy that either.

1686
01:18:50,899 --> 01:18:53,493
You know why she
left home, don't you?

1687
01:18:53,569 --> 01:18:54,968
Look, I didn't want
this to happen!

1688
01:18:55,037 --> 01:18:56,231
No, but it did!

1689
01:18:56,305 --> 01:18:58,535
And if you'd done things
differently she'd be here now!

1690
01:18:58,607 --> 01:19:00,302
I know that!

1691
01:19:01,677 --> 01:19:04,908
What's this got to do with the
death of her friend, Angie?

1692
01:19:07,616 --> 01:19:10,176
Angie died after she
took an ecstasy tablet.

1693
01:19:10,252 --> 01:19:12,652
I think Jane
dared her to do it.

1694
01:19:12,721 --> 01:19:14,416
I was the only
one who knew that.

1695
01:19:14,490 --> 01:19:15,616
Jane couldn't
handle the guilt.

1696
01:19:15,691 --> 01:19:17,784
She went on like she'd got
over it, but she hadn't.

1697
01:19:17,860 --> 01:19:19,657
One day she just walked out.

1698
01:19:21,964 --> 01:19:24,660
And you said nothing.

1699
01:19:24,733 --> 01:19:29,067
Even though she needed all
the help that she could get.

1700
01:19:29,138 --> 01:19:34,508
She got that ecstasy tablet
from you, didn't she?

1701
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:40,305
I didn't know.

1702
01:19:40,382 --> 01:19:43,476
She just took it.

1703
01:19:43,552 --> 01:19:46,544
That's why you paid up.

1704
01:19:46,622 --> 01:19:48,681
That's why you
kept your mouth shut,

1705
01:19:48,757 --> 01:19:53,421
to protect yourself.

1706
01:19:53,495 --> 01:19:57,158
I thought she'd come
back in her own time,

1707
01:19:57,232 --> 01:20:01,669
when she'd
sorted herself out.

1708
01:20:01,737 --> 01:20:07,266
Kids don't sort themselves
out from living in the gutter.

1709
01:20:07,342 --> 01:20:09,071
It felt like she was trying
to drag me down with her!

1710
01:20:09,144 --> 01:20:10,509
Because down was
where she wanted to go.

1711
01:20:10,579 --> 01:20:11,978
Nothing was going to stop her.

1712
01:20:12,047 --> 01:20:13,742
I wanted to...

1713
01:20:13,816 --> 01:20:16,979
I wanted to
protect them from that.

1714
01:20:22,691 --> 01:20:26,183
You're going to
have to tell them.

1715
01:20:26,261 --> 01:20:29,697
You owe them that.

1716
01:20:29,765 --> 01:20:31,733
And her.

1717
01:20:57,526 --> 01:20:59,255
Rickie?

1718
01:21:07,302 --> 01:21:08,894
Rickie?

1719
01:22:06,528 --> 01:22:11,591
We need to talk, Rickie.

1720
01:22:11,667 --> 01:22:15,296
She came back here
that night, didn't she?

1721
01:22:17,506 --> 01:22:20,236
When?

1722
01:22:20,309 --> 01:22:23,142
Ten, eleven.

1723
01:22:34,589 --> 01:22:37,023
All right.

1724
01:22:37,092 --> 01:22:38,150
Come on.

1725
01:22:39,528 --> 01:22:42,429
What happened?

1726
01:22:42,497 --> 01:22:44,931
She'd been off
with this old bloke,

1727
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,161
the one in the car.

1728
01:22:47,235 --> 01:22:50,102
The one that you identified.

1729
01:22:50,172 --> 01:22:52,868
She couldn't go
through with it.

1730
01:22:52,941 --> 01:22:55,705
When she told him,
he went ape-shit.

1731
01:22:55,777 --> 01:22:57,938
He threw her out of
the car and laid into her,

1732
01:22:58,013 --> 01:23:00,982
punched and kicked her,

1733
01:23:01,049 --> 01:23:03,882
And she was badly hurt?

1734
01:23:03,952 --> 01:23:06,352
Bad enough.

1735
01:23:06,421 --> 01:23:09,322
Inside was worse.

1736
01:23:09,391 --> 01:23:12,656
I didn't really know
how much worse.

1737
01:23:12,728 --> 01:23:14,855
We talked.

1738
01:23:14,930 --> 01:23:17,899
I tried to tell her
it was all right.

1739
01:23:17,966 --> 01:23:21,231
I thought she was OK.

1740
01:23:21,303 --> 01:23:22,930
We went to sleep.

1741
01:23:23,005 --> 01:23:25,701
In the morning she was gone.

1742
01:23:28,543 --> 01:23:31,671
Look, I didn't want to talk
to you in the first place,

1743
01:23:31,747 --> 01:23:33,977
but I started.

1744
01:23:34,049 --> 01:23:36,609
I wanted to make him pay,

1745
01:23:36,685 --> 01:23:38,949
for what he
made her feel like,

1746
01:23:39,021 --> 01:23:44,049
he might as well
have killed her.

1747
01:23:44,126 --> 01:23:46,458
But he didn't.

1748
01:23:50,465 --> 01:23:52,456
She left this.

1749
01:23:56,772 --> 01:24:00,936
It says, 'See you on the
other side of the starlight.

1750
01:24:01,009 --> 01:24:03,000
Goodbye 'till then'.

1751
01:24:08,683 --> 01:24:11,345
I'm sorry.

1752
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:14,719
She had a friend who died,

1753
01:24:14,790 --> 01:24:19,022
she didn't talk
about it much,

1754
01:24:19,094 --> 01:24:21,995
but she said that afterwards

1755
01:24:22,064 --> 01:24:24,589
she used to look
up to the stars

1756
01:24:24,666 --> 01:24:27,191
and think her friend was
there, behind the night,

1757
01:24:31,206 --> 01:24:34,835
Iike if you
turned it inside out

1758
01:24:34,910 --> 01:24:38,107
there'd be no more darkness,

1759
01:24:38,180 --> 01:24:40,842
just stars and light.

1760
01:24:43,351 --> 01:24:45,649
I loved her.

1761
01:24:57,265 --> 01:24:59,233
Leave us alone for a
minute will you Sarge?

1762
01:24:59,301 --> 01:25:01,030
You know better
than that, Jack.

1763
01:25:01,103 --> 01:25:03,731
Oh, I'd like to, believe me.

1764
01:25:03,805 --> 01:25:04,931
He's perfectly safe with me

1765
01:25:05,006 --> 01:25:06,268
it's just I've
got a piece of news

1766
01:25:06,341 --> 01:25:08,104
I want to deliver personally.

1767
01:25:08,176 --> 01:25:10,508
Yeah, well, I'll
still be outside.

1768
01:25:13,315 --> 01:25:14,213
Well Mr. Deering,

1769
01:25:14,282 --> 01:25:16,773
it appears that
you're free to go.

1770
01:25:16,852 --> 01:25:20,117
Sergeant Brady has
your personal effects.

1771
01:25:20,188 --> 01:25:21,519
I told you that
I didn't do it.

1772
01:25:21,590 --> 01:25:24,320
Yes, yes you did.

1773
01:25:24,392 --> 01:25:25,552
You also told me

1774
01:25:25,627 --> 01:25:27,652
that you didn't beat up
a sixteen year old girl

1775
01:25:27,729 --> 01:25:29,720
when she refused
to have sex with you.

1776
01:25:29,798 --> 01:25:31,561
But because she's
dead I can't prove it.

1777
01:25:31,633 --> 01:25:35,967
But we both know that you did.

1778
01:25:36,037 --> 01:25:38,335
And after that

1779
01:25:38,406 --> 01:25:40,306
she killed herself.

1780
01:25:44,546 --> 01:25:46,241
You said that I'm free to go.

1781
01:25:46,314 --> 01:25:48,475
Yes, you are, go on.

1782
01:25:50,886 --> 01:25:52,251
By the way,

1783
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:53,548
we will be pressing ahead

1784
01:25:53,622 --> 01:25:57,991
with the curb
crawling charges.

1785
01:25:58,059 --> 01:26:00,789
And don't you go
being a shrinking violet,

1786
01:26:00,862 --> 01:26:03,797
because I've got friends
in the newspaper industry

1787
01:26:03,865 --> 01:26:07,198
who are going to make
sure that's well covered.

1788
01:26:08,537 --> 01:26:11,370
Oh, and don't expect to
find your wife and kids

1789
01:26:11,439 --> 01:26:13,202
when you get back home.

1790
01:26:13,275 --> 01:26:14,401
Apparently you'll be hearing

1791
01:26:14,476 --> 01:26:18,037
from Mrs. Deering's
solicitor at some point.

1792
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:40,395
I still can't believe it.

1793
01:26:40,468 --> 01:26:41,662
You cut a man's body up,

1794
01:26:41,736 --> 01:26:44,500
put it in plastic bags and,

1795
01:26:44,573 --> 01:26:46,336
for God's sake...

1796
01:26:46,408 --> 01:26:48,103
We had to get rid of it.

1797
01:26:48,176 --> 01:26:50,770
The plane was
the obvious answer.

1798
01:26:50,845 --> 01:26:52,437
You try putting a
body in a Cessna

1799
01:26:52,514 --> 01:26:54,675
without anybody seeing it.

1800
01:26:54,749 --> 01:26:56,512
It had to be in bits.

1801
01:26:56,585 --> 01:26:57,609
Fine.

1802
01:26:57,686 --> 01:26:58,550
If I'd realized that

1803
01:26:58,620 --> 01:27:00,110
I never would have
questioned it.

1804
01:27:00,188 --> 01:27:01,951
Jim, will you listen
to what your saying!

1805
01:27:02,023 --> 01:27:03,251
Joop knew what he was doing.

1806
01:27:03,325 --> 01:27:04,519
I left him to it.

1807
01:27:04,593 --> 01:27:05,787
We didn't have any choice.

1808
01:27:05,860 --> 01:27:07,418
But it didn't work did it?

1809
01:27:07,495 --> 01:27:08,985
It wasn't foolproof, no,

1810
01:27:09,064 --> 01:27:11,760
but it did the job.

1811
01:27:11,833 --> 01:27:12,857
If they had anything on us

1812
01:27:12,934 --> 01:27:15,129
we'd be in Denton nick by now.

1813
01:27:15,203 --> 01:27:16,534
They took this
place to pieces.

1814
01:27:16,605 --> 01:27:18,129
And your bloody plane.

1815
01:27:18,206 --> 01:27:19,173
If they can't prove anything,

1816
01:27:19,241 --> 01:27:20,401
Frost can write
a book about it

1817
01:27:20,475 --> 01:27:23,444
and it wouldn't mean
a thing, would it?

1818
01:27:23,511 --> 01:27:25,911
You thought you
were so clever.

1819
01:27:25,981 --> 01:27:28,779
Just clever enough,

1820
01:27:28,850 --> 01:27:30,818
that'll do me.

1821
01:27:34,256 --> 01:27:36,281
You keep a lid on it

1822
01:27:36,358 --> 01:27:38,019
and it'll do you
(unintelligible).

1823
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:53,329
Jack?

1824
01:27:53,408 --> 01:27:54,306
Yes?

1825
01:27:54,376 --> 01:27:55,343
I think we're in business.

1826
01:27:55,410 --> 01:27:56,399
Why's that?

1827
01:27:56,478 --> 01:27:58,105
Bloke stopped in
a stolen car on the M4.

1828
01:27:58,179 --> 01:27:59,578
Wrong plates,

1829
01:27:59,648 --> 01:28:03,982
the plates from
Warren Barber's car.

1830
01:28:04,052 --> 01:28:05,383
Where did he get them?

1831
01:28:05,453 --> 01:28:07,318
He worked in a scrap yard
for a couple of weeks,

1832
01:28:07,389 --> 01:28:09,414
here in Denton.

1833
01:28:37,152 --> 01:28:39,177
(Sirens)

1834
01:28:43,525 --> 01:28:44,651
Hear that?

1835
01:28:44,726 --> 01:28:47,126
It means we're closed.

1836
01:28:47,195 --> 01:28:49,663
I don't know whether
you recognize these,
Mr. Radcliffe?

1837
01:28:49,731 --> 01:28:51,221
Yeah, they're number plates.

1838
01:28:51,299 --> 01:28:52,630
And you're coppers.

1839
01:28:52,701 --> 01:28:54,601
Well, that's two right.

1840
01:28:54,669 --> 01:28:57,365
These plates came
off a stolen vehicle.

1841
01:28:57,439 --> 01:28:59,703
The driver said he got
them from this yard.

1842
01:28:59,774 --> 01:29:00,536
No way.

1843
01:29:00,608 --> 01:29:02,576
I keep a record of everything
that comes through here.

1844
01:29:02,644 --> 01:29:05,545
Do you know
Gerry Ryan, Jim Scott?

1845
01:29:05,613 --> 01:29:06,637
I know Jim.

1846
01:29:06,715 --> 01:29:08,239
Any reason why I shouldn't?

1847
01:29:08,316 --> 01:29:11,149
Originally these
plates came off a car

1848
01:29:11,219 --> 01:29:13,517
that Mr. Scott asked
you to get rid of.

1849
01:29:13,588 --> 01:29:15,852
Now the owner was killed

1850
01:29:15,924 --> 01:29:19,519
the night before your
chum brought you the car.

1851
01:29:19,594 --> 01:29:22,529
Now you might call that
doing a favor for a mate.

1852
01:29:22,597 --> 01:29:24,462
I call it accessory to murder.

1853
01:29:24,532 --> 01:29:25,897
And so will the judge.

1854
01:29:25,967 --> 01:29:26,934
Hold on.

1855
01:29:27,001 --> 01:29:28,559
Jim Scott said it was nicked.

1856
01:29:28,636 --> 01:29:30,433
He needed rid of it, quick.

1857
01:29:30,505 --> 01:29:32,973
How involved are you
with Scott and Ryan?

1858
01:29:33,041 --> 01:29:34,065
I'm not.

1859
01:29:34,142 --> 01:29:36,133
I owe Jim some
money, that's all.

1860
01:29:36,211 --> 01:29:37,735
Well I do hope that
you're a close friend

1861
01:29:37,812 --> 01:29:40,508
because you see
accessory carries with it

1862
01:29:40,582 --> 01:29:41,913
a lot of years.

1863
01:29:41,983 --> 01:29:44,679
And as this was a
particularly nasty murder

1864
01:29:44,753 --> 01:29:45,947
that'll up the ante.

1865
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:47,044
Look, I told you.

1866
01:29:47,122 --> 01:29:48,282
I don't work with them.

1867
01:29:48,356 --> 01:29:49,550
I'm not into
that sort of thing.

1868
01:29:49,624 --> 01:29:50,613
What sort of thing?

1869
01:29:50,692 --> 01:29:52,159
Look, work it out.

1870
01:29:52,227 --> 01:29:54,354
This is Amsterdam
we're talking about.

1871
01:29:54,429 --> 01:29:57,660
Nobody smuggles beef
from Amsterdam, do they?

1872
01:30:20,588 --> 01:30:24,251
Will you tell me
about it, Gerry?

1873
01:30:24,325 --> 01:30:26,589
I don't know where to start.

1874
01:30:29,431 --> 01:30:32,332
You've been a
thousand miles away.

1875
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:35,927
The boys have seen it too.

1876
01:30:36,004 --> 01:30:38,063
I can't help

1877
01:30:38,139 --> 01:30:42,667
if you won't tell
me what's wrong.

1878
01:30:42,744 --> 01:30:46,043
You remember when the
business was going to fold,

1879
01:30:46,114 --> 01:30:48,014
when it looked like we were
going to lose everything.

1880
01:30:48,082 --> 01:30:50,050
We didn't.

1881
01:30:50,118 --> 01:30:53,087
We're going to now, Julia.

1882
01:30:53,154 --> 01:30:54,746
We'll manage.

1883
01:30:54,823 --> 01:30:56,848
Only now it's worse.

1884
01:30:56,925 --> 01:30:59,325
Much worse.

1885
01:30:59,394 --> 01:31:01,123
We'll lose everything

1886
01:31:01,196 --> 01:31:04,723
and probably...

1887
01:31:04,799 --> 01:31:06,892
I'm probably
going to go to prison.

1888
01:31:06,968 --> 01:31:10,335
What are you talking about?

1889
01:31:10,405 --> 01:31:13,340
It's a long story.

1890
01:31:13,408 --> 01:31:14,898
It seemed it was only
like turning a blind eye

1891
01:31:14,976 --> 01:31:17,274
to something that
couldn't touch us.

1892
01:31:17,345 --> 01:31:20,143
There was money
no one could trace.

1893
01:31:20,215 --> 01:31:24,879
Jim Scott and I.

1894
01:31:24,953 --> 01:31:27,786
Now there's a man dead.

1895
01:31:27,856 --> 01:31:28,948
I didn't know.

1896
01:31:29,023 --> 01:31:30,513
Oh, Gerry, why?

1897
01:31:30,592 --> 01:31:33,925
Why didn't you talk to me?

1898
01:31:33,995 --> 01:31:37,487
Oh, darling.

1899
01:31:37,565 --> 01:31:39,328
I'm sorry.

1900
01:31:40,735 --> 01:31:42,202
Poor old Barber mislead us.

1901
01:31:42,270 --> 01:31:44,761
It wasn't the meat,
it was the transport.

1902
01:31:44,839 --> 01:31:47,967
Get Customs and Excise
down to Scott's yard.

1903
01:31:48,042 --> 01:31:49,066
You know, with our lot.

1904
01:31:49,143 --> 01:31:50,269
Mullett going to
be happy about this?

1905
01:31:50,345 --> 01:31:51,243
Mullett!

1906
01:31:51,312 --> 01:31:52,438
Leave Mullett out of this.

1907
01:31:52,514 --> 01:31:53,776
These blokes know
what they're doing.

1908
01:31:53,848 --> 01:31:57,011
Our jokers will take all
night to take a truck apart.

1909
01:31:57,085 --> 01:31:58,780
Yes, I know,
you're a good boy.

1910
01:31:58,853 --> 01:32:01,151
You tried to tell me that
the lorry was full of drugs,

1911
01:32:01,222 --> 01:32:02,280
and I didn't listen to you.

1912
01:32:02,357 --> 01:32:04,848
All right, I'm an idiot.

1913
01:32:04,926 --> 01:32:06,018
So, where will you be?

1914
01:32:06,094 --> 01:32:09,063
Well, Ryan's not at home.

1915
01:32:09,130 --> 01:32:11,121
I reckon he's
down at the plant.

1916
01:32:11,199 --> 01:32:12,063
We've got a lever.

1917
01:32:12,133 --> 01:32:13,964
If we can keep
Scott and him apart

1918
01:32:14,035 --> 01:32:15,696
it won't take long
before we can break him.

1919
01:32:15,770 --> 01:32:18,466
So I want you to stay
here for Customs and Excise

1920
01:32:18,540 --> 01:32:20,201
and I'll meet you down there.

1921
01:32:20,275 --> 01:32:21,799
Umm, no sugar!

1922
01:32:21,876 --> 01:32:24,367
Come on Kai, off we go.

1923
01:32:24,445 --> 01:32:25,571
Good boy.

1924
01:32:25,647 --> 01:32:26,944
Let's go.

1925
01:32:27,015 --> 01:32:28,039
Come on.

1926
01:32:50,838 --> 01:32:51,998
I told you Frost
wouldn't leave it.

1927
01:32:52,073 --> 01:32:52,937
I told you.

1928
01:32:53,007 --> 01:32:54,474
Why the hell you
had to kill Barber?

1929
01:32:54,542 --> 01:32:55,907
Joop knocked him out.

1930
01:32:55,977 --> 01:32:57,569
We brought him in here.

1931
01:32:57,645 --> 01:32:58,839
He tried to make a run for it.

1932
01:32:58,913 --> 01:33:00,278
I stopped him.

1933
01:33:00,348 --> 01:33:01,406
With a meat hook.

1934
01:33:01,482 --> 01:33:02,642
He was dead.

1935
01:33:02,717 --> 01:33:04,685
It just happened.

1936
01:33:07,488 --> 01:33:08,614
Come on George!

1937
01:33:08,690 --> 01:33:10,157
We haven't got all night.

1938
01:33:16,564 --> 01:33:17,826
Kai, stay.

1939
01:33:17,899 --> 01:33:18,729
You stay.

1940
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:20,290
Good boy.

1941
01:33:23,871 --> 01:33:25,338
Kai.

1942
01:34:20,528 --> 01:34:23,053
You weren't going to
send him home, were you?

1943
01:34:23,131 --> 01:34:24,996
He had to be killed.

1944
01:34:25,066 --> 01:34:27,500
I wasn't going to
do ten years for him.

1945
01:34:27,568 --> 01:34:30,560
It's going to be a
lot more than that now.

1946
01:34:30,638 --> 01:34:32,003
You're out of control, Jim.

1947
01:34:32,073 --> 01:34:34,041
Yeah?

1948
01:34:34,108 --> 01:34:35,234
Like I was out of control

1949
01:34:35,309 --> 01:34:36,537
when I saved your business

1950
01:34:36,611 --> 01:34:37,635
from going down the tube?

1951
01:34:37,712 --> 01:34:40,203
Yeah, it all seemed so easy.

1952
01:34:40,281 --> 01:34:41,373
And it still is.

1953
01:34:41,449 --> 01:34:42,711
It's over, Jim.

1954
01:34:42,784 --> 01:34:44,046
Can't you see that.

1955
01:34:44,118 --> 01:34:46,382
Frost knows and he's
going to get there.

1956
01:34:46,454 --> 01:34:48,684
No.

1957
01:34:48,756 --> 01:34:51,088
Not if we stick it out.

1958
01:34:54,696 --> 01:34:58,188
We're in this together,

1959
01:34:58,266 --> 01:35:00,496
Right!

1960
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:06,903
Together.

1961
01:35:06,974 --> 01:35:09,374
We're mates, Gerry.

1962
01:35:09,444 --> 01:35:11,309
Do you know what this is?

1963
01:35:11,379 --> 01:35:12,573
It's a record of every payment

1964
01:35:12,647 --> 01:35:14,615
you've made me over
the last ten years.

1965
01:35:14,682 --> 01:35:18,709
I'm going to give it to Frost.

1966
01:35:18,786 --> 01:35:21,516
Let me show you
something in the truck.

1967
01:35:30,531 --> 01:35:31,725
Whatever you've
got to show me

1968
01:35:31,799 --> 01:35:33,767
it's not going
to change my mind.

1969
01:35:33,835 --> 01:35:35,860
It started with a bit
of dope being brought in.

1970
01:35:35,937 --> 01:35:38,565
Now it's ecstasy,
cocaine, heroin, you name it.

1971
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:40,072
I told you it
was time to stop.

1972
01:35:40,141 --> 01:35:42,200
I wanted to stop.

1973
01:35:42,276 --> 01:35:45,370
The people who set us
up won't let us stop.

1974
01:35:45,446 --> 01:35:46,538
They're not a Savings Bank,

1975
01:35:46,614 --> 01:35:48,172
They own us.

1976
01:35:48,249 --> 01:35:49,876
No.

1977
01:35:49,951 --> 01:35:51,680
I'm not going to look
the other way any more.

1978
01:35:51,753 --> 01:35:55,154
I'm going to Frost
with the truth.

1979
01:35:55,223 --> 01:35:58,056
You're a clown, Gerry.

1980
01:35:58,126 --> 01:35:59,525
Always were.

1981
01:35:59,594 --> 01:36:00,561
I mean it.

1982
01:36:00,628 --> 01:36:01,788
And if your brain
wasn't so altered

1983
01:36:01,863 --> 01:36:02,989
with the stuff
you're smuggling in,

1984
01:36:03,064 --> 01:36:04,554
you'd know I do.

1985
01:36:13,608 --> 01:36:15,371
Bastard.

1986
01:36:15,443 --> 01:36:17,001
You Bastard.

1987
01:36:17,078 --> 01:36:19,478
All right, that's enough!

1988
01:36:19,547 --> 01:36:21,572
I said that's enough, Scott!

1989
01:36:30,892 --> 01:36:32,792
You think I'm going down?

1990
01:36:32,860 --> 01:36:34,122
You can sod off!

1991
01:36:34,195 --> 01:36:34,889
No!

1992
01:36:34,962 --> 01:36:36,122
No!

1993
01:36:53,147 --> 01:36:54,944
That's him.

1994
01:36:55,016 --> 01:36:56,313
Come on.

1995
01:37:49,203 --> 01:37:50,727
I'll be about ten minutes.

1996
01:37:50,805 --> 01:37:53,069
I don't know why you don't
leave it till next week, Jack.

1997
01:37:53,140 --> 01:37:54,266
If the doctor
says take it easy,

1998
01:37:54,342 --> 01:37:55,707
you should take it easy.

1999
01:37:55,776 --> 01:37:58,006
If I take it
easy for any longer

2000
01:37:58,079 --> 01:38:00,240
they'll have to carry me
out in a straight jacket.

2001
01:38:00,314 --> 01:38:02,043
Anyway I've been
a burden enough

2002
01:38:02,116 --> 01:38:04,175
to the National
Health Service.

2003
01:38:15,529 --> 01:38:17,019
Right, come on, out you come!

2004
01:38:17,098 --> 01:38:18,656
Better go and do
what a dog's got to do.

2005
01:38:18,733 --> 01:38:21,293
You must be bursting.

2006
01:38:24,171 --> 01:38:26,196
You better give him a hand.

2007
01:38:26,274 --> 01:38:27,605
What?

2008
01:38:27,675 --> 01:38:28,767
Well it's obvious.

2009
01:38:28,843 --> 01:38:30,310
He can stand on three legs,

2010
01:38:30,378 --> 01:38:31,970
but when he's
got to cock a leg

2011
01:38:32,046 --> 01:38:33,308
that leaves him just two,

2012
01:38:33,381 --> 01:38:35,679
with the inevitable result.

2013
01:38:40,021 --> 01:38:42,888
Come on Kaiser, out you go.

2014
01:38:42,957 --> 01:38:44,720
Will you get out!

2015
01:38:44,792 --> 01:38:48,057
Well, no one's pushing
you to get back to
work you know, Jack.

2016
01:38:48,129 --> 01:38:49,061
No, I know, sir,

2017
01:38:49,130 --> 01:38:50,324
but if I stay at
home any longer

2018
01:38:50,398 --> 01:38:53,663
I'll have to buy
a television license.

2019
01:38:53,734 --> 01:38:56,464
No, no, I'd rather
be back at work, sir.

2020
01:38:56,537 --> 01:38:59,370
The Regional Crime Squad
will be investigating

2021
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:01,408
the Ryan Scott
network now, you know.

2022
01:39:01,475 --> 01:39:03,773
With Dutch and German police.

2023
01:39:03,844 --> 01:39:06,438
I'm sure they'd be very
happy to have you in on it.

2024
01:39:06,514 --> 01:39:09,108
Should pull in
some major players.

2025
01:39:09,183 --> 01:39:12,152
No, there's
plenty of work here.

2026
01:39:12,219 --> 01:39:14,847
It's not as
though it's getting us
anywhere though, is it?

2027
01:39:14,922 --> 01:39:16,412
Well, it's another
drug route closed.

2028
01:39:16,490 --> 01:39:17,980
Yes, that's right.

2029
01:39:18,059 --> 01:39:19,856
And then another
one opens this week,

2030
01:39:19,927 --> 01:39:20,791
and then next week,

2031
01:39:20,861 --> 01:39:22,556
and the week after.

2032
01:39:22,630 --> 01:39:26,157
If it is a war,
we're not winning.

2033
01:39:26,233 --> 01:39:28,599
Well, come back as you like.

2034
01:39:28,669 --> 01:39:30,068
All right, thank you very...

2035
01:39:30,137 --> 01:39:33,265
oh, by the way, this is for
you sir, it's the vet's bill.

2036
01:39:33,341 --> 01:39:34,239
Oh, yes.

2037
01:39:34,308 --> 01:39:35,536
Did a marvelous
job, didn't he?

2038
01:39:35,609 --> 01:39:36,940
Oh, yes.

2039
01:39:37,011 --> 01:39:38,774
Good grief, Jack.

2040
01:39:38,846 --> 01:39:40,404
Is this right?

2041
01:39:40,481 --> 01:39:41,413
Oh yes.

2042
01:39:41,482 --> 01:39:44,246
It says prompt payment
would be appreciated.

2043
01:39:44,318 --> 01:39:47,253
Best not get behind with
these things, eh, sir?

2044
01:39:48,489 --> 01:39:49,854
Come on.

2045
01:39:49,924 --> 01:39:51,824
You got in, you can get out.

2046
01:39:51,892 --> 01:39:53,291
Come on!

2047
01:40:00,835 --> 01:40:03,303
Haven't you got him out yet?

2048
01:40:03,371 --> 01:40:04,702
Well, either he
doesn't want to go,

2049
01:40:04,772 --> 01:40:05,932
or he's not as keen

2050
01:40:06,007 --> 01:40:08,601
to get back to
Denton nick as you are.

2051
01:40:11,779 --> 01:40:13,474
What is it Kai?

2052
01:40:17,451 --> 01:40:19,681
Hey, now don't over do it!

2053
01:40:19,754 --> 01:40:21,346
Kaiser!

2054
01:40:21,422 --> 01:40:23,583
Hello Kai.

2055
01:40:23,657 --> 01:40:26,217
They'll probably
give Kaiser a medal.

2056
01:40:26,293 --> 01:40:30,525
He didn't get his by
falling down the stairs.

2057
01:40:30,598 --> 01:40:32,225
Go on take him inside.

2058
01:40:32,299 --> 01:40:34,961
He'll tell you all about it.

2059
01:40:35,036 --> 01:40:37,266
Come on, Kaiser.

2060
01:40:37,338 --> 01:40:38,896
It's true what
they say, George.

2061
01:40:38,973 --> 01:40:39,871
Yeah?

2062
01:40:39,940 --> 01:40:41,874
The more you
know about people,

2063
01:40:41,942 --> 01:40:45,105
the more you appreciate dogs.
