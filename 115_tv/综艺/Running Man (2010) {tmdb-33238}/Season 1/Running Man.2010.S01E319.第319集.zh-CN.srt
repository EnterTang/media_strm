1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,520
THE MAlL GOES TO JAlL

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,320
So, Norm, any luck impregnating Vera?

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,160
l miss the old days
when people asked me things like,

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,320
''How are those Red Sox doing?''
Things like that.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,720
Well, excuse me for caring.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,040
l'm sorry, Larry, l'm just a little edgy.

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,040
You have to understand
l've gone an entire month with sex.

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,760
Normie, Larry understands.
Don't you, Larry?

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,600
But you've been trying for a few weeks
now and you've yet to strike paydirt.

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,000
Can l ask you a personal question?

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,600
Heaven forbid this conversation
get personal now.

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,880
Have you been to a fertility specialist?

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,640
Yeah, we have,
but l don't have a lot of faith in this guy.

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,800
He's got Vera sprinkling powdered
rhinoceros horn on my morning cereal.

15
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,720
Does it make you feel more virile,
Normie?

16
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,360
Not really, but every now and then
l get this urge to charge a jeep.

17
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,880
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

18
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,600
What would you say to a beer, Normie?

19
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,840
Daddy wuvs you.

20
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,040
- lt's freezing.
- Didn't you hear?

21
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,240
We've given our appliances
the winter off.

22
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,680
There's a blockage in the heating.

23
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,960
The furnace is working,
but we're not getting hot air.

24
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,120
- What's Sammy going to do?
- l cannot believe this helplessness.

25
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,800
How about a little Yankee ingenuity?

26
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,400
lf Cheers were burning,
would you wait for Sam to get back?

27
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,840
No, Diane,
cos l already taught them the fire drill.

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,560
We all file out in an orderly fashion
after nailing your hair to the bar.

29
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,960
We don't usually see you this early.

30
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,880
l'm sick, Diane.
l must be coming down with something.

31
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,440
Thought l'd get some coffee here
before l finish my route.

32
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,960
- No, Cliff, let me get you a nice brandy.
- No, Coach, l hope l'm never that ill.

33
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,640
That's one thing
that'll never touch these lips.

34
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,320
There's something that wants to?

35
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,400
Alcohol. l'm on duty, Carla.
Just a coffee, please, Coach.

36
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,640
l can do better than that for you.

37
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,880
Will somebody go upstairs to Melville's
and get this man a bowl of hot soup?

38
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,040
What happened to the heat, Coach?

39
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:53,360
Some minor malfunction that no one
here is skilled enough to attempt to fix.

40
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,720
Diane, l resent that.
l'm kind of a handy guy.

41
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,960
l'll have you know just the other day
l changed one of them...

42
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,240
- What do you call them?
- A light bulb.

43
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,160
Why don't you just call in sick?

44
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,880
l could never do that.
lt's a matter of principle with me.

45
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,200
l've got to be on the verge of death
before l take sick leave.

46
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,480
You used it up to go to Florida.

47
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,920
You got a problem with that?

48
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,000
- Here you go, Cliffie.
- Thank you, Norm.

49
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,920
- How many letters you got left?
- l don't know. Seven or eight.

50
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,160
- Boy, this tastes good.
- These are on my way home.

51
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,720
Let me drop these off for you.
l've got to go home anyway.

52
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,040
No, you're not trained.
You're not qualified.

53
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,840
Qualified? You drop them in a slot.
A chimp could do it.

54
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,120
No way. They did a study
at the University of Michigan.

55
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,280
Chimps were 32% slower.

56
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,760
Yeah, they were better with
customer relations and everything.

57
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:04,800
Clifford, he is offering to do you a favour
out of friendship for your own good.

58
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,000
Sounds like you have two options.

59
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:13,040
Either let me deliver these
or run the risk of non-delivery...

60
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,960
- l'll drop these off.
- Thank you, Normie.

61
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,720
ln those envelopes are the
dreams, hopes and fears of a nation.

62
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,920
Yeah, and several
car-wash announcements.

63
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,480
Hey, everybody. Oh, boy! Holy cow!
What happened here?

64
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,880
<i>lt was warmer in the mountains
and we were au natural.</i>

65
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,760
- Coach, did you check the furnace?
- lt's not the furnace. lt's that damn vent.

66
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,480
l called the repairman.
He's on his way over.

67
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,320
Good. Bambi, it's up to you and me
to generate a little heat for these folks.

68
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:57,000
Don't bother. We'll just huddle around
a three-watt light bulb.

69
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,720
Feisty little barmaid.
l took her in off the streets.

70
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,560
She's crude, but devoted.

71
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,000
l had a terrific time. Thank you.

72
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,320
Thank you, Sam.
lt was the best ski trip l ever had.

73
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,320
- Yeah. Me, too.
- Did you find any time for skiing?

74
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,560
No, darn it. Somebody stole our skis.

75
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,760
We had to spend
the whole weekend in the lodge.

76
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,240
That's too bad.

77
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,680
But when we were leaving, they turned
up in the rack on the roof of Sam's car.

78
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,000
Some kids must have stolen them
for a joy-ski.

79
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,400
Disrespectful punks.

80
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,800
l've got to get going.
l have to be at BU in half an hour.

81
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,280
BU? That's Boston University,
isn't it, Bambi?

82
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,960
- That's right.
- Where the smart types hang out.

83
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,400
- What are you studying?
- l'm not studying.

84
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,440
l'm going to be part of a fraternity stunt.

85
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,680
Yeah, she's tutoring some of the boys.

86
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,800
- ln a way. See you later, Sam.
- You take care.

87
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,920
Well, l guess l better take a look
at this air duct.

88
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,320
Sometimes the problem's over here.

89
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,440
Bambi?

90
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,760
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

91
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,680
Well, l suppose
it's better than Dumbo or Goofy.

92
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,160
Not as appropriate, but...

93
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,640
Coach, can l have my flashlight, please?

94
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,320
You know, Sam...

95
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:44,000
l can't help but noticing
that Bambi wasn't the same little deer

96
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,440
that you left here with on Friday.

97
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,200
No, l got rid of Cindy.
We weren't compatible.

98
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,720
Really? What was the problem there?

99
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,400
Dumb as a post.

100
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,280
With so much in common,
l can't imagine why you two went awry.

101
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,280
No, l'm serious.
She wasn't my intellectual equal.

102
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,840
You should have said you're
looking for an intellectual equal.

103
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,360
l could introduce you to something
that's growing on my shower curtain.

104
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,400
Thank you, Diane, but l think l'll wait
and see how Bambi works out.

105
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,120
l've done just about everything
l know what to do.

106
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,400
You shined a flashlight on it.

107
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,160
Yeah, it usually works, too.

108
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,720
This one's really got me stumped.

109
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:40,120
Could somebody go up to Melville's
and get me a little bit more soup?

110
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,760
Larry? You're not doing
anything important there.

111
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,520
- Yeah, all right.
- Good man.

112
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,640
- Thanks a lot.
- l suppose you want some crackers?

113
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,800
Well, those low-sodium kind, all right?

114
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,880
- What's he doing in my office?
- The guy is sick as a dog.

115
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,080
Coach, l'm not so bad now.

116
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,040
l could probably sit up at the bar there
and let Larry bring dinner down to me.

117
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,280
- Cliff Clavin?
- Yeah, Officer. What's the trouble?

118
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,520
- Do you know a Norm Peterson?
- Yeah. What is it?

119
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,840
He's at the station.
We've arrested him for mail theft.

120
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,040
- You made a mistake.
- There's no mistake.

121
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,480
We caught him messing
with mail boxes on your route.

122
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,640
He had a handful of letters.
He said he was delivering them for you.

123
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,040
- l asked him to.
- You asked him to?

124
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,640
Well, you're out of a job, fella.

125
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,120
Excuse me, Officer,
you interrupted me before l finished.

126
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,480
l asked him to quit following me.

127
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,640
l had him pegged
as a sociopath right away.

128
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,120
He's a frustrated mailman.
We call it postal envy.

129
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,960
Anything serious going
to happen to this ne'er-do-well?

130
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,160
- Not serious enough.
- l rue the day they outlawed flogging.

131
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,400
Bleeding hearts.

132
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,680
How well do you know this guy?

133
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,720
We talk every now and then.
He's a portly guy, isn't he?

134
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,840
Full size.

135
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,760
What will happen to this Patterson fella?

136
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,440
- Peterson.
- Officer, l'm the owner of the bar here.

137
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,920
Sam Malone. ls there a problem?

138
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,840
No. Some guy tried to implicate this
letter carrier in a mail theft on his route.

139
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,600
- Crazy.
- You're kidding me. Mail theft?

140
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,600
Ridiculous. l've known Cliff for years.
He wouldn't be involved in that.

141
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,400
You're a fine bartender.
You are one of Boston's finest.

142
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,080
Thanks.
We just had to check out the story.

143
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,880
And check it out you did.

144
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,800
The Federal government appreciates
the cooperation of you local boys.

145
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:49,440
Let's hope our penal system can
rehabilitate the wretch. Thank you.

146
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,560
Can you believe that?

147
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,040
- Let's shoot some stick.
- Sure.

148
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,120
They arrested a guy on Cliff's route
for mail theft.

149
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,680
- You want eight ball or straight pool?
- Norman was finishing your route.

150
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,160
- Clifford?
- What was that?

151
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,920
You mean they arrested Norm?
You didn't straighten the cop out?

152
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,880
lt's a bit complicated.
Sam, do you want to break?

153
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,560
- Clifford, get back here.
- lsn't it obvious what l did here?

154
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,040
Yeah, it's obvious what you've done.

155
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,280
You've run your best friend Norm
up the river.

156
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:27,160
We're in trouble here. My job's hanging
by a thread. Norm's in jail anyway.

157
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,720
Just leave him there a little longer while
l figure out what's the best thing to do.

158
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,840
- Norm will be OK.
- Norm isn't at some party, you know?

159
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,160
By now he's probably had all his
valuables taken, been strip-searched,

160
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,040
been deloused and thrown into a dark,
cold cell with a sex-starved pervert.

161
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,320
So? That's how he describes
a typical evening at home.

162
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,160
Hey, come on!

163
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,680
l'm looking for an attorney that
specialises in criminal federal offences.

164
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,880
You're going to be defending the best
friend l have and money is no object.

165
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,160
How much? For one guy?

166
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,160
Stick your writ in your briefs,
you ambulance chaser.

167
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:24,960
Let's let a young public defender
make a name for himself on this one.

168
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,280
l wish you'd see this through my eyes.

169
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,120
l'd like to see this through your eyes.

170
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,400
Come on, Carla.
Norm's such a sweet, cuddly guy.

171
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,120
The jury will look in his sad eyes.
They won't fry him.

172
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,680
- But my career hangs in the balance.
- l'd like to see you hang in the balance.

173
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,680
l notice a certain recurring theme
in your comments here, Carla.

174
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,800
Norm was doing you a favour.

175
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,680
You don't even know if you are
going to get into trouble, Cliffie.

176
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,160
Will you get off my back?

177
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:00,080
l'll do the gutsy thing and call the
post office and get Norm out of there.

178
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,360
l'll call them
and tell them it was the O'Hara kid.

179
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,040
He won't mind time in jail,
if you get my drift.

180
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,160
- This isn't a joke.
- Where's your sense of humour?

181
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,280
lf Norm was here, he'd laugh.

182
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,880
lf Norm was here, he'd tear out
your tonsils and feed them to you.

183
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,880
All right, l'll call and see what the penalty
is, but it's got to be anonymous.

184
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,560
OK, everybody in favour of Cliff calling,
raise your hand.

185
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,520
lt's anonymous. Not even an extension.

186
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,840
lt's just what l wanted to hear.

187
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,680
How'd you make out, Sam?

188
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:43,280
Lousy. They won't let Norm go
unless the post office drops charges.

189
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,880
Cliff's going to have to tell the truth.
l've got to talk to him.

190
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,560
- He's on the phone now.
- Confessing?

191
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,840
No, he's finding out
what would happen if he did.

192
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,160
Meantime, you got other problems.

193
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,920
The furnace guy didn't show up?

194
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:03,640
No. We decided somebody should
climb into the duct and try to open it.

195
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,240
- Who?
- The skinniest person we could think of.

196
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,080
You're kidding me. Diane agreed
to crawl around in the air duct?

197
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,720
She had to. She'd been shooting
her face off about it all day.

198
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,720
- Where is she?
- l'm beneath you.

199
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,200
l always knew that, but...

200
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,520
My goodness! Well, looky here.

201
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,960
- How about that.
- l'm glad you find this amusing.

202
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,440
What are you doing down there?

203
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,200
Aerobics, you idiot.

204
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,080
Why don't you get out of there,
so l can fix it?

205
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,800
l can't crawl any further and my clothes
are snagged on something.

206
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,640
l can't back up. l'm stuck right here.

207
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,720
OK, egg-toss fans, step right up!

208
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,280
Hit the geek and win a beer.
Three eggs for a nickel.

209
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,720
Sam, aren't you going to step in?

210
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,000
You bet your booties l am.
l only got a dime, give me six.

211
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,920
Sam, please.

212
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,440
Carla, how could you suggest
such a thing? Terrible.

213
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,720
l'll go down in the basement
and see if l can get you out.

214
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,960
Thank you. Sam,
will you put the grate back, please?

215
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,720
Someone almost stepped on my face.

216
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,560
With the cutest little satin pumps.

217
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,840
- Thanks.
- All right?

218
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,280
My supervisor confirmed exactly
what l had suspected all along.

219
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,040
That he hired you as a token weenie.

220
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,480
No, he said a courier who let
somebody else deliver his mail

221
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:37,240
could face a hearing where he could be
suspended or even relieved from duty.

222
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,240
- What about Norm?
- Norm's got no previous record.

223
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,960
They'll just give him a suspended
sentence and a sharp reprimand.

224
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,760
Cliff, you're wrong.
You know you're wrong.

225
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,520
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- Coach is right, Clifford.

226
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:59,120
You don't deserve to have a friend
like Norman if you let him down now.

227
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,520
So either you go in there
and straighten this out or we will.

228
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,880
We're never going to let you
show your face in here again.

229
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,880
All right.

230
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,120
l'll call my supervisor and explain
the whole thing in the morning.

231
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,400
- Now!
- All right. Now.

232
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,120
l'll go explain the whole thing now.

233
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,080
l want you all to know that this is going
to mean the end for me.

234
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:29,320
Yeah, l'll be a civilian, one of the crowd.

235
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,960
There's a lot of things l'll miss, too.

236
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,800
The free mucilage, the twine.

237
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,720
The open-with-care labels we stick
on our flies at the Christmas party.

238
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,440
The uniform, the respect.
l'm leaving here a mailman.

239
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,600
l'm coming back a nobody.

240
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,520
Diane, l can't get to you.

241
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,240
The opening of the air duct is too small.

242
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,480
Coach, call the furnace man, please,
and tell him it's an emergency.

243
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,640
l already called him again, honey,
this evening.

244
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,120
He said he might not make it at all.

245
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:11,120
- Sam, do something.
- l know somebody else l can call.

246
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,360
But listen. l mean this.

247
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,920
lf you say the word, l will rip
this floor up to get you out of there.

248
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,440
- Do it, Sam, please.
- That's not the word.

249
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,120
- Swine.
- No, you're getting colder.

250
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,440
Come on, now, sweetheart, open up.

251
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,360
You don't know how long
you're going to be in there.

252
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,760
You've got to stay warm.
There you go!

253
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,960
l'm sorry.

254
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:53,600
You know, Diane, the important thing
here is just to relax and stay calm.

255
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,280
Just remember, rats sense fear.

256
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,600
Here you go, darling.

257
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,760
How's that?

258
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:09,360
Sam, l'm not hungry and l'm not cold.
l just want to get out of here.

259
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,600
l know, sweetheart. The guy l called
said he'll be here in a minute.

260
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,760
Say...

261
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,720
Just on the off chance that the guy's
not able to get you out of there,

262
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,640
don't you think you'd feel better
if you declared your love for me now,

263
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,200
while you still had the chance?

264
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,880
You're right, Sam.

265
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,720
What did you say?

266
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:40,080
Let go!

267
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
She said she loves me,
always has, always will.

268
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,840
You're off the clock, sweetheart.

269
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Only a dollar?

270
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,160
No, it's happy hour. lt's only 50 cents.

271
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,120
Pucker up, baby!

272
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:08,160
Hold it. Go sit down!
How could you do that?

273
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,920
lt's all right, Sammy.
He had all his shots in the army.

274
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,160
Great news, everybody!

275
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,520
Because of my spotless record,
l only received a 30-day suspension.

276
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,240
What about Norm? ls he getting out?

277
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,960
My supervisor already called the cops.
Virtue triumphs again.

278
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,800
Set them up, Sammy, drinks are on me.

279
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,880
l guess l've got to give you credit.
That wasn't an easy thing to do.

280
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,600
What do you suppose is going to happen

281
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,200
when the big guy
walks through that door?

282
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,440
Our attitude should be he's paid his debt
to society. Let him start a new life.

283
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,120
That's not exactly
what Carla had in mind, Cliff.

284
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,440
He's going to be sore at you, Cliffo.

285
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,800
- l suppose he is and perhaps justly so.
- Perhaps?

286
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,800
Underneath that anger is going
to be love and understanding.

287
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,240
We go back a long way, he and l.

288
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,640
When that big fella comes in,
l'm just going to go up to him,

289
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,320
admit my error
and ask for his forgiveness.

290
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,000
- Here comes Norm now.
- Good.

291
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:14,040
lf l know him, his understanding
will not long be withheld.

292
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,160
Come on, you guys!

293
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,080
- l'll kill him!
- Come on.

294
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,240
- But first l want to hurt him a whole lot.
- Take him over there.

295
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,400
Get him out of here.
Out of this bar, out of my life for ever.

296
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,400
Normie, l'll go.
But l want you to remember one thing.

297
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,880
l confessed and got you out of jail.

298
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,880
l wouldn't have been in jail
if it wasn't for you!

299
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:51,640
All right, l'm sorry about that, Normie.
l'm really sorry, but try and understand.

300
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:57,560
Your job's just a job,
but being a mailman's my whole identity.

301
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,520
l risked my whole world,
my entire life, to buy your freedom,

302
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,600
because l love you, Norm.

303
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,960
Come on, Norm,
isn't there something Cliff can do?

304
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,560
Norman, he's right.

305
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,760
What is your heart telling you?

306
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,000
- Never mind. lt's a long story.
- Goodbye, Norm.

307
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,000
All right, wait, Cliffie.

308
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,560
l guess we have been friends a long
time. You are, by nature, a weasel.

309
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,520
There's something
you can do for me, l guess.

310
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,040
You can buy me a beer...

311
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,920
...with your pants around your ankles.

312
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,920
- You can't be serious, Norm.
- Ankles, Cliffie.

313
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:04,280
Standing on that stool
while barking like a seal.

314
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,760
Let's not stay.
There'll be a cover charge.

315
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,360
