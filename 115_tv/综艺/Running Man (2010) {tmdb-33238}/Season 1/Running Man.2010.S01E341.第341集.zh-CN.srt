CLIVE: (HEAVILY ACCENTED)
Dr. Gopnik, I believe
the results

62
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,719
of the physics midterm
were unjust.

63
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,486
Uh-huh? How so?

64
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,828
I received
unsatisfactory grade.

65
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,130
In fact, F,
the failing grade.

66
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:06,899
Yes. You failed the midterm.
That's accurate.

67
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:08,564
Yes, but that is not just.

68
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:11,799
I was unaware
to be examined
on the mathematics.

69
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:15,040
Well, you can't do
physics without mathematics,
really, can you?

70
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:18,550
If I receive
the failing grade,
I lose my scholarship,

71
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:19,914
and I feel shame.

72
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:23,719
I understand the physics.
I understand the dead cat.

73
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:27,384
But you can't really
understand the physics

74
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,222
without understanding
the math.

75
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:33,061
The math tells
how it really works.
That's the real thing.

76
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:36,727
The stories
I give you in class
are just illustrative.

77

to help give you a picture.

00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:42,001
I mean...

79
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,709
Even I don't understand
the dead cat.

80
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,678
The math is how
it really works.

81
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,043

82
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:50,539

83
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,607

84
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:53,777
What do you propose?

85
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:55,012
Passing grade.
No, no.

86
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:57,282
Or perhaps I can
take the midterm again.

87
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,119
I know now it cover
the mathematics.

88
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:01,921
Well, the other students
wouldn't like that,
would they?

89
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:05,555
If one student gets to
retake the test until
he gets a grade he likes?

No...

have to bite the bullet

Twenty bucks?
How come?

Bought a lid
from Mike Fagle

119
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:37,580
Still owed him 20.

120
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,317
He already
gave you the pot?

121
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:42,754
Yeah. But a couple
of weeks ago,
my funding got cut off.

if I didn't pay up.

he was confiscating it.

Sy?

152
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:02,160
Sy Ableman.
That's right, he called.
But I...

153
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:03,758
You didn't talk to him?
No.

154
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:08,338
You know the problems
that you and I
have been having?

155

Mmm-hmm.

156
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:12,136
Well, Sy and I
have become very close.

157
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:18,609
In short, I think
it's time that we start
talking about a divorce.

159

This is not about Sy.

160
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,619

323
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:47,615
Well, they're anonymous,
so we dismiss them completely.

324
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:50,093
Well, what do they say?

325
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:52,725
Well, they
make allegations...

326
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:54,856
Well, allegations...
Assertions.

327
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:58,800
And though we
give them no credence
at all, Larry.

328
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:01,161
Well, I'm not really
at liberty

329
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:03,833
to discuss the specifics of
the committee's deliberations.

330
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:07,605
But I think you're saying
these won't play any part
in your deliberations?

331
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:08,940
None whatsoever.

332
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:10,002
So what are they?

333
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:12,914
Moral turpitude,
you could say.

334
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:17,081
Uh-huh.
Can I ask?
Are they...

335
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:20,214
Are they idiomatic?
Hmm?

336
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:24,091
The reason I ask,
I have a Korean student.
South Korean.

337
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:28,063
A disgruntled South Korean,
and I meant to talk to you
about this...

338
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:33,331
Oh, no, no.
They're competently,
even eloquently written.

339
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:36,965
A native English speaker.
There's no question
about that.

340
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:39,441
Uh-huh.
Let me reiterate.

341
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,000
别放在心上

342
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:45,880
我只是觉得不该瞒着你

343
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,577
对 没错

344
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,678
向Judith问声好

345
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,927
我得拿回我的收音机

346
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:02,192
也许那混蛋把它寄存在了屁眼里

347
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,701
我得拿回来 
否则Mike Fagle会揍扁我的

348
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,169
一路往上

349
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:22,545
下午好

350
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:27,613
去洗手 Mitch

351
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,818
去打猎了?

352
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:38,868
那是要...

353
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:40,335
要做成一个船棚

354
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:41,735
是吗

355
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:42,795
好极了

356
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,842
- Brandt先生...
- 我说去洗手 Mitch!

357
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:53,149
今天不上学吗?

358
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:55,276
我去学校接他出来跟我去打猎的

359
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:00,454
呃 Brandt先生

360
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:02,493
那里差不多是地界线

361
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,959
我觉得我们不该--

362
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:05,655
- 在超过10英尺...
- 地界线是那棵杨树

363
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:09,159
那棵...杨树

364
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,530
- 即使那里 你也超过了 
- 你去量

365
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:15,572
- 我不必量 你可以看出来...
- 分界线是杨树

366
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,066
怎么回事?

367
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:19,533
没什么

368
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:24,009
Larry?
什么事?

369
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:25,708
你去找Sieglestein Schlutz了吗?

370
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:26,875
没有 我...还没去

371
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:27,975
Larry

372
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:29,314
约的是星期一

373
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:30,684
你去哪里?

374
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:32,017
我要去Hole

375
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:33,681
什么? 现在才5点?

376
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:36,283
我们要在Laurie Kipperstein家停一下 
我可以洗个头

377
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:37,885
你好 Gopnik先生

378
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:40,457
- 你不能在这里洗? 
- Arthur叔叔在浴室里

379
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,123
我马上出来!

380
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,292
- 你准备好了吗?
- 嗯?

381
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,891
- 我们要去Embers见Sy
- 我也去?

382
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:47,301
我们一起去 我告诉过你 Larry 

383
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:50,501
Larry

384
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:55,903
你好吗?

385
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:58,739
Sy

386
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:02,343
你好 Judith

387
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,444
你好 Sy

388
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:08,887
Larry 我要感谢你过来

389
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:12,754
我们能讨论这些事非常重要

390
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,559
我很高兴来Embers Sy

391
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:18,123
但我想 也许最好把讨论留给律师

392
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:18,566

393
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:21,469
当然 法律问题就让律师去解决吧

394
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:23,564
橘子苹果不能混为一谈

395
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:25,074
我求你去见律师

396
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:26,404
我说我星期一去

397
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:29,105
星期一来得及 这不是...

398
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:32,877
Embers不是法律事务论坛 你说得没错

399
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,008

400
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:37,577
Judith和我只是想讨论 呃

401
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,856
实际事务 住房安排

402
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:45,059
毕竟大家对此都没有异议

403
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:46,323
住房安排?

404
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:50,696
我想我们都同意孩子们

405
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,862
不该受紧张关系的毒害

406
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,064
这一点至关重要

407
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:57,164
我们不该让孩子受影响 Larry

408
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:58,299
孩子没有...

409
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:00,310
我说的是"我们" 不是指代谁

410
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:03,040
没有人要指责谁 Larry

411
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,240
我没这么说

412
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,306
也不要影射其他人

413
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:08,409
- 我没有! 我...
- 好吧 听我说

414
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:12,217
我们退后一步讲 化解这个情况

415
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:17,986
你知道 Larry 有时候我觉得

416
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:19,723
如果我数到10...

417
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:22,723
1

418
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:24,990
2

419
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:27,562
3

420
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:30,234
4...

421
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:32,608
或者默念

422
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:42,713
说真的 为了把事情安排妥当

423
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,652
迎接Danny的成人礼

424
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:46,519
孩子的成人礼 Larry

425
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:50,321
我和Sy认为 你最好搬走

426
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:52,686
搬走?

427
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:55,231
- 这显然很有道理
- 生活可以继续...

428
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:56,766
搬走? 搬去哪里?

429
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,928
比如说 "海盗旗"就很合适

430
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,301
价钱也不贵

431
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:03,966
房间非常适宜居住

432
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:05,565
也方便你来探访孩子

433
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:07,702
那里提供便利设备 还有个泳池

434
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:10,440
你搬去跟Sy住不是更合理吗?

435
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:13,475
Larry

436
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:17,012
Larry 你...你在开玩笑

437
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:20,853
我真的认为搬去"海盗旗"

438
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:23,985
是最适当的做法

439
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:27,395

440
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:30,525
听着

441
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:32,330
你个小混蛋 把钱还我!

442
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:33,597
别打了! 我会拿到的!

443
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:34,695
还给我!

444
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:36,433
你欠我20美元 屎球!

445
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:38,498
- 放心!
- 给我 讨厌鬼!

446
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:41,044
- 我会拿到的!我会拿到的!
- 讨!厌!鬼!

447
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:42,739
- 怎么回事?
- 没什么

448
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:47,141
- 什么情况?
- 没什么

449
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,310

450
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,910
"律法"的进度如何?

451
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:52,353
你能用音响放吗?

452
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:53,685
什么? 我能借一下这个吗?

453
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:57,660
我要带些东西去"海盗旗"

454
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:58,888
- 爸!
- 没问题 爸

455
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:00,931
爸! 有个中国人!

456
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,491
文化碰撞

457
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:06,428
文化碰撞

458
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,540
恕我直言 Park先生 
我觉得不是这个问题

459
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:11,905
- 是
- 不是

460
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:15,571
如果在你们国家 买学分是惯例

461
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:17,113
那才叫文化碰撞

462
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,273
是

463
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,011
你是说那是惯例?

464
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:25,385
不 这是中伤 我要告你

465
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,082
我说白一点

466
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:29,752
你威胁要告我中伤你儿子?

467
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:30,953
是

468
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,825
- 但是...
- 这人找你茬吗?

469
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:37,795
他找我茬? 没有

470
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,032
我 呃...

471
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:48,675
你看...

472
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:50,407
如果是中伤 必须有个人

473
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:52,608
听我说中伤他的话 否则我...

474
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:54,708
好吧 简单讲

475
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:58,221
我可以假装没有钱这回事 
那就没有中伤任何人

476
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,655
对 然后给他及格

477
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:03,019
- 给他及格?
- 是

478
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:05,620
否则你要告我?

479
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:06,856
告你收受贿款

480
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:08,660
所以他是留了钱?

481
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:09,994
这是中伤!

482
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:14,362
这没道理 他要么留了钱 要么没留

483
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:16,736
请接受这个谜案

484
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:21,607
给我 混蛋

485
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:30,548
他很擅长数字

486
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:34,022
我想是他的社交技能阻碍了他

487
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:36,082
不过他真是个好人

488
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,457
Arthur有一颗善心

489
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:40,962
他从不抱怨 不像我

490
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:43,932
有时候我没有给他足够的赞赏

491
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:47,767
他想告诉我他在忙的东西 叫...

492
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,669
Mentaculus

493
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:55,979
他说那可能是宇宙的地图

494
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,346
他出去社交吗?

495
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:03,408
他在努力 
打算去希勒尔旅馆的单身聚会

496
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,954
其实我也没好到哪里去

497
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:10,588
Judith怎么样?

498
00:42:12,763 --> 00:42:15,425
很好 她很好

499
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:20,293
有时候这些事不该发生的

500
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:24,239
你需要时间感受真相

501
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:26,708
反正我从来没有感受到!

502
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:29,976
简直是晴天霹雳

503
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,241
什么意思?

504
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:35,081
一切都不是我原本想的那样

505
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:40,784
这就是你认识真相的机会

506
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:43,558
我不想信口说教

507
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:49,694
解读上帝的旨意并不容易

508
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:53,397
但你不必自己一个人扛着

509
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:56,236
我们是犹太人

510
00:42:56,707 --> 00:43:00,643
我们利用优良传统帮我们理解

511
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:04,008
当我们有疑问时 
有过相同问题的前人

512
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:07,778
早把亲身经验传给了后人

513
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:11,812
你跟Nachtner拉比谈过吗?

514
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:16,548
怎么不见见他?

515
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:18,288
拉比能告诉我什么?

516
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:20,391
如果我知道 我也去当拉比了

517
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:24,461
这里的空气真清新

518
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:30,100
我说 如果有人把这空气装瓶

519
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:31,971
他们能赚上一百万

519
00:43:35,174 --> 00:43:36,971
第一个拉比

520
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:50,624
你好 Larry 见到你真好

521
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:52,059
哦 Scott拉比

522
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,557
我以为我约的是Nachtner拉比

523
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,794
他被人叫去主持etz monim了

524
00:43:57,868 --> 00:44:01,599
Ruth Brynn的母亲住院了 
情况不太好

525
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:04,937
Nachtner拉比叫我来代班 进来吧

526
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:19,987
她想要一个gett

527
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,121
一个什么?

528
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,596
- 她想要...
- 哦 gett

529
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,226
嗯 当然

530
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:35,767
我感觉像地毯从我身下抽走

531
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,137
我不知道那端朝上

532
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:40,005
我甚至不知道怎么回应

533
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:41,408
脑子里一团乱麻

534
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:45,542
她要离婚的理由是什么?

535
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:48,210
她没有理由 只是说--

536
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:50,549
事情不是很顺利

537
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:51,713
是这样吗?

538
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,880
我想 我不知道

539
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:56,187
她在这些事上比较在行

540
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,694
我本希望Nachtner拉比能...

541
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,255
他...他能...什么?

542
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:03,595
以他丰富的人生经验

543
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:05,529
无意冒犯

544
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:08,730
当然不会 我是初级拉比

545
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:13,139
没错 长辈也许有过相同经历

546
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:17,579
他们的意见会更有帮助

547
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:20,708
你该去见见资深拉比

548
00:45:20,784 --> 00:45:22,012
甚至Marshak

549
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:24,248
如果能约到的话

550
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:26,915
他很忙 但也许...

551
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,752
我能跟你说个事吗?

552
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:36,030
因为我也有过失去Hashem的感觉

553
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,898
你的问题就在此

554
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:42,268
我也忘了如何见到他

555
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:44,398
发生这种事时 你会想

556
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:48,468
"如果我见不到他 那他就不存在
他消失了"

557
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,338
但不是这样的

558
00:45:50,848 --> 00:45:53,874
你只要记得如何见到他

559
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:56,249
我说得对吗? 我是说...

560
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:59,312
这里的停车场

561
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:03,792
虽然不大

562
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:07,124
但你若想象自己是个游客

563
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:11,924
并不熟悉这些汽车之类的东西

564
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:14,630
还保留着感到惊奇的能力

565
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:17,868
拥有一个全新的视角

566
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:19,739
就是它 Larry

567
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:21,835
因为有了正确的视角

568
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:25,370
你就能见到Hashem向人们伸出援手

569
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,179
他就在我们中间 而不仅仅在教堂里

570
00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:33,822
听起来你看世界 看你妻子的视角

571
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:35,825
已经疲倦了

572
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:40,122
好像她变成了一样东西...

573
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,322
一个问题

574
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:43,958
一样东西

575
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:46,161
她跟Sy Ableman好了

576
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:52,908
- 哦
- 他们计划...

577
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,409
所以他们才要gett

578
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,708
哦 对不起

579
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,304
这是他的主意

580
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:03,820
他们确实需要gett才能再婚

581
00:47:05,055 --> 00:47:08,081
但是...这就是生活

582
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:12,927
你得把这些事看成是上帝的旨意

583
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,896
当然你不必喜欢它

584
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,664
老大不总是对的 但他终归是老大

585
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:19,531
没错!

586
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,432
情况还不算太糟

587
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,803
瞧瞧这停车场 Larry

588
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:27,705
只要看看停车场

589
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,975

590
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:44,922
现在就开始吃了?

591
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:46,428
Sarah要出门

592
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:48,429
哦! 少来!

593
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:49,726
怎么回事?

594
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,063
爸不吃吗?

595
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,471
他在"海盗船"

596
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:00,737
哦 对了

597
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:02,540

598
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:07,209
你怎么样 Larry?

599
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:09,809
上帝 真遗憾

600
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,481
- 你遇上这档子事 
- 还好...

601
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:15,184
我一直以为你和Judy会白头到老

602
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:18,524
这事太糟了 Larry 叫人震惊

603
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:20,028
你知道 我的看法是

604
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:23,589
这是让我静下来思考的好机会

605
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:27,899
我能重新认识世界 你知道

606
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:31,907
而不是循规蹈矩 以旧眼光看问题

607
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:34,869
是吗?

608
00:48:36,146 --> 00:48:37,613
我不知道 也许不是

609
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:42,616
法律上我要警告你

610
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:45,120
作为丈夫向来要吃亏的

611
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:52,458
除非 妻子存在违背婚约的问题?

613
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:54,588
哦 没有 不是这样的

614
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:57,259
不过她打算嫁给Sy Ableman 但他们...

615
00:48:57,334 --> 00:48:58,699
Sy Ableman!

616
00:48:59,803 --> 00:49:02,863
- 对 但他们...
- Esther尸骨未寒!

617
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:04,971
她死了三年了

618
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:09,240
但这还是改变了局面 Larry

619
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:11,112
Sy Ableman

620
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:14,082
并不是...他们没有奸情

621
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:15,175
据我所知

622
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:18,517
- 哦
- 对 我敢肯定没有这回事

623
00:49:18,588 --> 00:49:21,751
事实上Judith想要一个gett

624
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:25,420
一个什么?

625
00:49:26,596 --> 00:49:28,120
离婚仪式

626
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:30,325
这样他们才能自由再婚

627
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,630
啊 没错 当然 呃...

628
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:34,728
不算什么法律问题

629
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:37,969
好吧 呃...

630
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:40,874
行 行

631
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:43,407
那么...

632
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,881
另外一件事 邻居的地界线

633
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:49,646
我叫Solomon Schlutz去看了

634
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:53,156
房产方面的事交给他就放心吧

635
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:54,918
好的 你们怎么...

636
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,516
我想我有点担心

637
00:49:56,593 --> 00:49:58,788
你们怎么...我手头比较紧张

638
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:00,921
我们的收费情况? 按小时计算

639
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:04,229
Dave Sieglestein和Solomon Schlutz
每小时110

640
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:07,202
律师助理 比如我 收费是...

641
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:09,738
Gopnik先生的电话 Danny从家里打来的

642
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:11,865
你可以在这里接

643
00:50:14,044 --> 00:50:15,170
0809

644
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,069
Danny?

645
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:19,809
- 喂 爸爸
- 你没事吧?

646
00:50:19,883 --> 00:50:20,872
你没...一切都还...

647
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:22,316
"F战队"看不清

648
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:25,449
什么?

649
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,251
"F战队"还是看不清

650
00:50:30,227 --> 00:50:32,024
爸? 你还好吧?

651
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:40,027

652
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:43,196

653
00:51:58,682 --> 00:51:59,671
Clive?

654
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:03,975
Clive!

655
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:08,654
你个小混蛋! 下次要叫你妈来吗?

656
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:12,525
小混蛋! 我要找你!

657
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:13,585

658
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:22,428
稍等

659
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,865
Gopnik教授 又是Dick Dutton

660
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:26,700
Dick Dutton

661
00:52:28,778 --> 00:52:29,836
你好?

662
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:31,403
你好 Gopnik先生?

663
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:34,245
我是哥伦比亚唱片俱乐部的Dick Dutton

664
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:37,411
我打来是因为已经过去四个月

665
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:39,853
我们还在等你支付第一笔款

666
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:43,882
你们搞错了

667
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,292
我不是哥伦比亚唱片俱乐部的会员

668
00:52:46,363 --> 00:52:50,094
先生 你是Fern Hill路8419号的 
Lawrence Gopnik吗?

669
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,862
不 我住在"海盗船"

670
00:52:51,935 --> 00:52:52,993
你说什么?

671
00:52:53,703 --> 00:52:55,000
不是 我...

672
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:58,169
好吧 是的

673
00:52:58,241 --> 00:53:00,141
- 你是Lawrence Gopnik?
- 好吧

674
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:01,868
"好吧"的意思是

675
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:04,209
好吧 我是Lawrence Gopnik 是的

676
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:07,273
你收到了12张介绍性专辑

677
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:10,877
四个月来一直在接收每月主选集

678
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:12,615
每月主选集? 那是唱片吗?

679
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,384
我没有索要唱片

680
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:17,688
每月主选集是免费的 你...

681
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:19,353
That's right.
I haven't done anything.

682
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:22,193
Yes, that's why
you received the
monthly main selection:

683
00:53:22,265 --> 00:53:26,964
(STAMMERING) But...
The last one was
Santana Abraxas. You: : :

684
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:30,529
I didn't ask
for Santana Abraxas:

685
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:32,700
You request
the main selection

686
00:53:32,776 --> 00:53:35,301
at the retail price
by doing nothing:

687
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,278
It's automatically
mailed to you,

688
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:38,905
plus shipping
and handling:

689
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:41,746
You're about to receive: : :
I can't afford
a new record every month!

690
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:43,251
I haven't asked...

691
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,289
You're about to get
Cosmo's Factory, sir:

692
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:47,948
The June
main selection:

693
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:50,458
Look, look,
something is very wrong!

694
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:52,791
I don't want
Santana Abraxas:

695
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:55,023
I've just been
in a terrible auto accident.

696
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:00,362
I'm sorry, sir:

697
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:05,606
Well, thank you.
But I...

698
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:07,533
Are you okay?

699
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:12,582
Yes, yes.
No one was hurt.

700
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:16,308
Okay: Good:

701
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:21,751
Well, you had
14 days to listen
to Santana Abraxas.

702
00:54:21,825 --> 00:54:22,917
Sir?
Look...

703
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:25,689
(STAMMERING) I didn't ask
for Santana Abraxas,

704
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:29,323
I didn't listen
to Santana Abraxas,

705
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:31,367
I didn't do anything!

706
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:33,402
Sir! Your son.
Mr: Gopnik: : :

707
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:34,903
He says it's urgent.

708
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:36,233
We can't make you
listen to the record: : :

709
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:38,035
Okay, okay, okay...
We provide: : :

710
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,541
Okay, I have to
call you back.

711
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,406
This is... I'm sorry.
No, no,
Mr: Gopnik, please: : :

712

Danny?
DANNY: Yeah: Listen, Dad: : :

713
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:44,808
Did you join
the Columbia Record Club?

714
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:48,478
Danny?
Um: : :

715
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:51,816
Danny, this is
completely unacceptable.
I can't afford to...

716
00:54:51,888 --> 00:54:53,583
Okay, Dad, but you
gotta come home:

717
00:54:55,058 --> 00:54:56,286
Is it F Troop?

718
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:58,293
No, Mom's real upset:

(JUDITH SOBBING)

720
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:11,396
SARAH: Dad?

721
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:12,532
Yes?

722
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:14,634
Does this mean
I can't go
to the Hole tonight?

723
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:16,611
Does what mean?
What happened?

724
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:19,012
Oh, Sy Ableman,
he died in a car crash.

725
00:55:19,082 --> 00:55:20,106
DANNY: Hey, Dad.

726
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:21,608
What?

727
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:23,084
So you're coming back home?

728
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,246
Can you fix
the aerial?

729
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:26,346
What?

730
00:55:26,423 --> 00:55:28,550
It's still,
you know...

731
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:33,089
(JUDITH WAILING)

732
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:43,563
(JUDITH SCREAMING)

733
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:05,086
She seems to be
asking an awful lot.

734
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:08,898
But then...
I don't know.

735
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:11,494
Somebody has to pay
for Sy's funeral.

736
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:13,458
Uh-huh.

737
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:14,935
His own estate
is in probate,

738
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:16,869
but why does it
have to be me?

739
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:19,067
Or is it wrong
to complain?

740
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:20,841
Judy says it is.

741
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:23,445
But I'm so strapped
for cash right now,

742
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:26,482
carrying the mortgage,
and paying
for the Jolly Roger,

743
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:29,950
and I wrecked the car,
and Danny's bar mitzvah
coming up, I...

744
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:32,886
Something like this,
there's never a good time.

745
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:36,253
I don't know
where it all leaves me.

746
00:56:36,326 --> 00:56:37,452
Sy's death.

747
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:41,955
Obviously, it's not
going to go back
like it was.

748
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:43,020
Mmm.

749
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:45,033
Would you even
want that, Larry?
No, I...

750
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:48,537
Well, yeah.
Sometimes.

751
00:56:49,272 --> 00:56:50,261
Or...

752
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:52,938
I don't know.
I guess

753
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:56,044
the honest answer is,
I don't know.

754
00:56:56,112 --> 00:56:59,548
What was my life before?
Not what I thought it was.

755
00:57:00,517 --> 00:57:01,814
So what does it all mean?

756
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:04,217
What is Hashem
trying to tell me,

757
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:06,585
making me pay for
Sy Ableman's funeral?

758
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:07,918
Mmm.
And did I tell you

759
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:10,926
I had a car accident
the same time Sy had his?

760
00:57:10,994 --> 00:57:13,326
The same instant,
for all I know.
Mmm.

761
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:17,127
Is Hashem trying
to tell me that
Sy Ableman is me?

762
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:20,159
Or that we are all one
or something?

763
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:23,265
How does God speak to us?

764
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:25,533
It's a good question.

765
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:27,668
You know Lee Sussman.

766
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,436
Dr. Sussman?
I think I... Yeah.

767
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:33,514
Did he ever tell you
about the goy's teeth?

768
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:36,209
No. Uh, what goy?

769
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:39,414
So, Lee is at work one day.

770
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:42,983
You know, he has
the orthodontic practice
there at Great Bear:

771
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:46,227
He's making a plaster mold:

772
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:49,925
It's for corrective
bridgework in the mouth
of one of his patients,

773
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:51,489
Russell Krauss.

774
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:05,511
The mold dries, and Lee
is examining it one day

775
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:07,948
before fabricating
an appliance:

776
00:58:08,017 --> 00:58:09,712
He notices
something unusual:

777
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:15,822
There appears to be
something engraved

778
00:58:15,892 --> 00:58:18,793
on the inside
of the patient's
lower incisors:

779
00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:30,227
Hey vav shin yud ayin nun yud.

780
00:58:31,941 --> 00:58:33,909
Ho-she-ay-ni.

781
00:58:33,977 --> 00:58:36,275
"Help me: Save me:"

782
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:38,776
This, in a goy's mouth, Larry.

783
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:47,483
He calls the goy back

784
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:50,856
on the pretense of needing
additional measurements
for the appliance:

785
00:58:51,227 --> 00:58:52,455
"How are you?

786
00:58:53,563 --> 00:58:55,531
"Noticed any other
problems with your teeth?"

787
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:58,689
"No:"

788
00:59:06,509 --> 00:59:07,737
There it is:

789
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:09,868
Ho-she-ay-ni.

790
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:10,935
"Help me:"

791
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:12,937
Son of a gun:

792
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:17,651
Sussman goes home:

793
00:59:18,588 --> 00:59:20,351
Can Sussman eat?
Sussman can't eat:

794
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:23,692
Can Sussman sleep?
Sussman can't sleep:

795
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:32,323
Sussman looks at the molds
of his other patients,

796
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:33,699
goy and Jew alike,

797
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:35,829
seeking other messages:
He finds none:

798
00:59:36,773 --> 00:59:38,434
He looks in his own mouth:

799
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:40,099
Nothing:

800
00:59:41,044 --> 00:59:42,875
He looks
in his wife's mouth:

801
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:49,544
Nothing:

802
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,581
But Sussman
is an educated man.

803
00:59:53,056 --> 00:59:54,683
Not the world's
greatest sage, maybe.

804
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:55,985
No Rabbi Marshak.

805
00:59:56,392 --> 00:59:59,418
But he knows
a thing or two about
the Zohar and the Kabbalah:

806
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:02,896
He knows that
every Hebrew letter
has its numeric equivalent:

807
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:05,833
8-4-5-4-4-7-3:

808
01:00:05,902 --> 01:00:08,234
Seven digits:
A phone number, maybe?

809
01:00:10,406 --> 01:00:14,001
"Hello? Do you know
a goy named Krauss,
Russell Krauss?"

810
01:00:14,077 --> 01:00:15,135
"Who?"

811
01:00:15,211 --> 01:00:16,371
"Where have I called?

812
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:20,082
"The Red Owl in Bloomington?
Thanks so much:"

813
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:25,913
He goes:

814
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,617
It's a Red Owl:
Groceries, what have you:

815
01:00:34,697 --> 01:00:37,632
Sussman goes home:

For a while, he checked
every patient's teeth
for new messages:

I don't want it
to just go away!
I want an answer!

Sure. We all
want the answer.

the answer, Larry.

The obligation
runs the other way.

Why does he make us
feel the questions

A man who despised
the frivolous.

You should try to
talk to Marshak.

he doesn't do

come to the phone?

If I came in, could...

984
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:03,905
Well, how about
at Rabbi Marshak's
convenience?

985

Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

Well, could I give you
my number at the Jolly Roger?

987
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:12,942
LARRY: X squared,
so that delta X equals

988
01:09:13,015 --> 01:09:16,109
the square root of
.077 A squared minus zero,

989
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:19,416
from which we derive
the square root of
.077 A squared.

990
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:21,046
And also, the uncertainty

991
01:09:21,123 --> 01:09:24,422
in P is equal to
the square root
of bracket P squared

992
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:26,961
minus bracket P squared,

993
01:09:27,029 --> 01:09:29,554
which also equals
the square root
of H over A squared.

994
01:09:29,632 --> 01:09:32,396
Which lets us
delta X, delta P

995
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:36,404
equals the square root
of.077 A squared,

996
01:09:36,472 --> 01:09:41,876
H over A squared,
and 1.74 H bar.

you will be responsible
for it on the mid-term.

Did you follow that?
Of course.

Except that I know
what's going on.

it's subtle, it's clever.

1010

But at the end of the day,
is it convincing?

1011

Well, yes,
it's convincing.

1012
01:10:31,026 --> 01:10:33,085
It's a proof.
It's mathematics.

1013

No, excuse me.
Mathematics is the art

Uh-huh. Yeah.

1035

let you know, since you're

How thoughtful.
Oh, it's nothing.

It's just good to
know your neighbors,
and to help.

Mmm. Very much so.

not fair to judge.
