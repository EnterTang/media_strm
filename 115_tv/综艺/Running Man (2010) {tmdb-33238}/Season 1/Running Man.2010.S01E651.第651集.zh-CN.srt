
651
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,000
或许那就是为什么Symmington太太
Perhaps that's why Mrs Symmington

652
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,400
不敢把信给他看吧
was afraid to show him the letter.

653
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,700
天啊 Burton先生
Good heavens, Mr Burton, 

654
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,700
你真的以为不真实的诽谤
do you seriously think any woman would swallow cyanide

655
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,800
会让一个女人服毒自尽吗
if the accusations weren't true?

656
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,800
清白的女人会一笑而过
An innocent woman would laugh it off, 

657
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,500
将之抛在脑后 要是我...我会这么做
throw it away. That's what I...I would do.

658
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,800
我们都会有自己的事业 Burton先生
We should all have a career, Mr Burton.

659
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,200
我想当医生 但我爸妈完全听不进去
I wanted to be a doctor, but my parents wouldn't hear of it.

660
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,600
- 不好意思 - 噢 没事
- I'm sorry. - Oh, don't be.

661
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,800
我觉得我是个非常幸福的人 再见
I'm one of the happiest people I know. Toodle-oo!

662
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,300
早上好 Burton小姐 希望你不会无聊
Good morning, Miss Burton. Not finding it too dull, I hope.

663
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,300
完全不会
Hardly.

664
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,200
看
Look.

665
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:17,300
你这淫荡的贱人 赶紧滚蛋
You painted trollop, go back to your bastard child.

666
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,800
很好
Nice.

667
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,300
非常好
Very nice indeed.

668
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,700
是的 这些单词是从旧书上剪下来的
Yes. The words have been cut from an old book.

669
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,300
我猜测是19世纪早期的
Early 19th century, I'd guess.

670
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,200
凶手很谨慎 戴了手套
Probably no fingerprints distinctive

671
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,400
所以并没有指纹留下
in the letters as the culprit is very careful to wear gloves.

672
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,700
信封上的字是用这个
Now, the envelope was typed on this.

673
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,300
Windsor Seven打印机打上去的
A Windsor Seven typewriter

674
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,700
所以字母A和D才不在一条直线上
with the letters A and D out of alignment.

675
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,100
这打印机谁的
So, who does it belong to?

676
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,400
妇女协会的
The Women's Institute.

677
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:50,000
是Galbraith办公室捐出来的旧款
It's an old model donated by the office of Galbraith, 

678
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,300
Galbraith和Symmington
Galbraith and Symmington.

679
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,400
- 所以 可能是... - 没错 他们中的任何一个
- So, it could be... - Yes. Any one of them.

680
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,400
妇女们经常去那 先生
The ladies are always in there, sir.

681
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,800
摸摸看 你就知道了 先生
You can probably tell by the touch, sir, 

682
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,700
是用一根手指打出来的
that was typed with one finger.

683
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,000
所以应该是个不习惯打印的人
So, it's someone not used to typing?

684
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,700
或许恰恰相反 他不想被认出来
Or somebody who is, but doesn't want us to know.

685
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,500
很有趣
Well, that's interesting.

686
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,300
怎么了
What is?

687
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:16,000
Burton的U好像是从A变过来的
The U in Burton seems to have been changed from an A, 

688
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,700
或许她确实不擅长打印
Perhaps she's not such a good typist after all.

689
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,600
也有可能比我们想象的要更聪明
Or maybe cleverer than we think.

690
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,900
- 我想知道她怎么想的 - 谁知道呢
- I wonder how she feels? - Who knows?

691
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,600
这个小玩意儿要送回去
But this little beauty is going back.

692
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,000
记住我的话
And mark my words, 

693
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,800
常在河边走 哪有不湿鞋
the pitcher will go to the well once too often.

694
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,300
- 可以聊一聊吗 先生 - 怎么了 Partridge
- Can I have a word, sir? - What is it, Partridge?

695
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,000
- 有关Agnes的 先生 - 噢 怎么了
- That was Agnes, sir. - Oh, yes?

696
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,800
她以前在这当过女佣
She was in service here.

697
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,500
她从孤儿院里出来的
And coming from the orphanage, 

698
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,100
她很乐意和我聊天
she's gotten happy to talking to me 

699
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,700
因此我可以和她说很多道理
so I could tell her what's what, you see.

700
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,000
说重点 Partridge
Get to the point, Partridge.

701
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,200
她现在为Symmingtons工作
Well, she works for the Symmingtons now

702
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,800
我想知道你允不允许她下午来这儿
and I wonder if you might give your permission for her

703
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,000
和我喝喝茶
to come to tea with me this afternoon.

704
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,400
她今天休假
It's her day off

705
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,100
她好像心事重重的 看上去很苦恼
and she's got something on her mind. She seems a bit of upset.

706
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:16,800
当然可以
Yes, of course.

707
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,900
谢谢 先生
Thank you, sir.

708
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,700
我得回家了
I must go home.

709
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,000
- 什么 - 今天
- What? - Today.

710
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,800
今天 为什么
Today? Why?

711
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,600
非常感谢你们能让我在这待着
It's been awfully good of you having me.

712
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,600
希望没打扰到你们
I expect I've been a fearful nuisance.

713
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,200
在这儿过得很开心 真的
I have enjoyed it awfully, really I have, 

714
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,000
现在我必须回去了 毕竟 那才是我的家
only, now I must go back because after all, it is my home.

715
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,600
我不可能永远在逃避
I can't stay away forever.

716
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,800
再见
Bye.

717
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,000
今天和Barton太太过得不错 Partridge
We had a lovely tea with Miss Barton, Partridge.

718
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,200
那很不错 小姐
Pleased to hear it, Miss.

719
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,900
你和Agatha过得怎么样
How was yours with Agatha?

720
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,300
Agnes 小姐
Agnes, Miss.

721
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,300 
- 对对 就是那个 - 她没来 小姐
- That's the one. - She didn't turn up, Miss.

722
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,100
- 噢 不好意思 - 没关系
- Oh, I am sorry. - Doesn't matter to me.

723
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,200
那就好
Good.

724
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,700
她约我见面 但爽约了
She wanted to meet and then she didn't show, 

725
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,800
还一句道歉都没有
and not a word of apology either.

726
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,900
可能身体不舒服吧
Perhaps she's not well.

727
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,500
但也有可能她没什么教养
And perhaps she's just ill-mannered.

728
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,700
怎么了
What is the matter?

729
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,900
真受不了你闷闷不乐的样子
I've never been able to bear it when you sulk.

730
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,700
我没有闷闷不乐 - 你就是闷闷不乐
- I'm not sulking. - You are sulking.

731
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,300
Megan走了你就开始闷闷不乐了
You've been sulking since Megan left.

732
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,500
事实上 你还是小孩的时候就成天闷闷不乐的
In fact, you've been sulking ever since you were a child.

733
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,800
- 我没有 - 你有
- I haven't. - You have.

734
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,400
你今天不高兴 明天不高兴
You were sulky then and you're sulky now.

735
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,700
你就是那样的
You're the sulky type.

736
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,400
我想喝一杯
I could do with a drink.

737
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,500
或许能让我开心点
Might cheer me up.

738
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,000
那为什么不来一杯呢
Then, why don't you have one?

739
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,400
我会的
I might just do that.

740
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,000
行 想喝多少就喝多少吧
Fine. Have as many as you want, 

741
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,700
然后喝到你都不知道自己是谁了
and when you're so drunk you can't remember who you are, 

742
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,700
骑着你的摩托一头撞死得了
Then why not go for a spin and this time make damn sure!

743
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:51,900
那是个意外
It was an accident.

744
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,500
你就是个无药可救的骗子 真可悲
You're a hopeless liar. It's really quite pathetic!

745
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,100
我就是不开心 就酗酒了
So, I'm sulky, I'm a drunk

746
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,800
而且连说谎都不会 那又怎么了...  
and I can't even lie properly. Is it any wonder that...

747
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,200
什么 Jerry 那又怎么了 
What, Jerry? Is what any wonder?

748
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,500
有什么关系吗
What does it matter?

749
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,900
你怎么能这么做
How could you do it?

750
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,000
如果那是你认为的
If that's what you want to believe...

751
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,400
你以为那不伤我的心吗?
How could you think it wouldn't break my heart?

752
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,300
看到你这么绝望 我伤透了心
It breaks my heart now to think you could feel so wretched.

753
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,600
这真的太讽刺了
You know, it strikes me as the most extraordinary irony

754
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,500
你好像举着旗子胜利了
that you managed to survive the war with such flying colours, 

755
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,700
但并没有真正找到了内心的平静
yet seem to find the peace so utterly defeating.

756
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,700
骂得很爽吧
Ghastly dump, isn't it?

757
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,700
我们可以回到过去
We could always go back.

758
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,500
抛弃所有的乐趣?
And miss all the fun?

759
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,200
你知道吗 Symmington太太去世
Do you know, it's exactly a week ago

760
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,600
都有一礼拜了
since Mrs Symmington's death?

761
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,500
警方应该已经有线索了吧
You'd think the police would have something by now.

762
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,800
指纹或者其他什么东西
A fingerprint or something.

763
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,300
- 是一周以前吗 - 嗯
- Exactly a week ago? - Mm-hm.

764
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,100
仆人们每周有一天假 是吗?
Maids have one day off a week, don't they?

765
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,700
是的
Yes.

766
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,200
都是同一天吗
The same day every week?

767
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,400
通常是这样的
That's the usual sort of thing. Apparently.

768
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,800
那么 刚好是一周之前
So, exactly a week ago, 

769
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,900
Symmington是一个人在家里
Mrs Symmington was alone in the house

770
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,700
因为那天仆人都休假了
because it was the maids' day off.

771
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,900
我觉得事情很难水落石出
I'm afraid the penny's refusing to drop.

772
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,900
Megan?
Megan?

773
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,200
她应该去和Partridge喝茶的
She was supposed to come to tea with Partridge, 

774
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,300
但并没有出现
but didn't turn up.

775
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,600
为什么你注意到这个了呢
Why would that be of particular concern to you?

776
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,800
我不确定 我就是觉得不太对劲儿
I'm not sure. I felt uneasy for some reason or other.

777
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,000
现在要从每个细节中寻找线索
With every cause, it now transpires.

778
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,600
你有很强的直觉 Burton先生
You have sensitive antennae, Mr Burton.

779
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,700
你也是 Marple小姐 灵光一闪 对吗
So do you, Miss Marple. Just passing, were you?

780
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,300
噢 Burton先生
Oh, Mr Burton.

781
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,600
Holland小姐 我想知道 Megan还好吧
Miss Holland, I was wondering, is Megan all right?

782
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:12,800
她躺下休息了
She's having a lie-down.

783
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,800
- Burton先生 - 不好意思
- Mr Burton? - Sorry.

784
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,800
你知道Agnes有和Partridge说了什么吗
Did Agnes say anything to Partridge,do you know?

785
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,300
她太焦虑了
She'd have been far too anxious 

786
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,800
在电话里什么也没说 探长
to divulge anything over the telephone, Inspector.

787
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,000
谢谢 Marple小姐
Thank you, Miss Marple.

788
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,000
Agnes通常会在午餐后出去走走
Agnes normally went out after lunch.

789
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,200
但事实证明她没离开过
It appears she never left, 

790
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:35,700
因为你找到她的时候她还穿着工作服
because she was wearing her apron and cap when you found her

791
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,400
知道死亡时间吗
Any idea of the time of death?

792
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,100
是的 八点到十点半之间
Yes, between 8.00 and 10.30.

793
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,100
怎么被杀的
And how was she killed?

794
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,200
利器重击后脑
Sharp blow to the back of the head, 

795
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:46,400
接着叉子直穿颅骨
followed by a skewer in the base of the skull.

796
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:47,500
天呐
Good God!

797
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,400
太可怕了
Quite appalling, isn't it?

798
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,100
- 但为什么 -我们可能永远不知道 
- But why? - Well, we may never know exactly, 

799
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:53,000
但我们可以猜测一下
but we can make a guess.

800
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,100
她或许知道了些什么
Well, she knew something, didn't she?

801
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,600
说的没错
That would be a fair assumption, yes.

802
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,100
Symmington太太死的那天中午
On the afternoon that Mrs Symmington died, 

803
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,300
两个仆人本该出去的
when the two maids were supposed to be out, 

804
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,100
但Agnes她提前回来了
Agnes, she came back rather early.

805
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,500
她有个男朋友
You see, she has a boyfriend.

806
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,200
渔船上的Freddy Firbank
Freddy Firbank from the fish shop.

807
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,900
是的 就在那天中午
Yes, and on that particular afternoon

808
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,600
他们一见面就吵了一架
they had a row when they first met.

809
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,200
我猜是年轻的Firbank收到了一封信
I gather that young Firbank received a letter

810
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,000
信里说Agnes脚踩两只船
suggesting that Agnes had other fish to fry.

811
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,600
但还有些疑点
But there is something else.

812
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,000
Symmington收到的那封信
The letter Mrs Symmington received

813
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,300
是没盖邮戳的
was never actually posted.

814
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,300
只是做出被投递的假象
It was faked to make it look as though it was posted, 

815
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:31,900
邮递员下午送信之前
but it was pushed through this letterbox here

816
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,500
这封信已经被投到邮箱里了
before the afternoon delivery.

817
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,300
我的推断是Agnes在这往窗外看
My guess is Agnes was looking through the window here

818
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,200
等着他男朋友来道歉
waiting for her boyfriend to come and apologise...

819
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,200
看到了凶手来送信
And saw the culprit deliver the letter.

820
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,600
完全正确
Exactly.

821
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:46,200
但凶手是怎么知道她在家的呢
But how would the letter writer know that she was home?

822
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,300
或许是巧合吧 Burton先生
Well, it's a kind of miracle, Mr Burton, 

823
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,100
事情究竟是如何发生的
how things get around this place.

824
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,200
我可能错了 当然 呃
I may be wrong, of course, but erm...

825
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,600
看上去很简单 不是吗
Temptingly simple, isn't it?

826
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,300
但是请告诉我 探长
But tell me, Inspector, 

827
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,900
如果Agnes知道谁是凶手
if Agnes knew who the letter writer was, 

828
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,000
我想知道为什么她什么也没说
then why, I wonder, didn't she say something?

829
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,100
Holland小姐
Miss Holland.

830
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:23,700
Burton先生
Mr Burton.

831
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,500
不好意思 我不是故意...
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

832
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,000
我不知道我怎么了
I don't know what's come over me.

833
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,900
应该是被吓到了
I think it's the shock.

834
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,900
- 太残忍了 -可怜的姑娘 
- Pretty grim, isn't it? - That poor girl.

835
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,400
被杀的可能是我们中的任何一个人
Just think, it could have been any of us, 

836
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,100
甚至那两个小天使
even those two little angels, 

837
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,300
像塔里的王子一样在床上被杀
murdered in their beds like princes in the tower.

838
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,000
Burton先生 这太可怕了
The awful thing, Mr Burton, 

839
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
昨日中午
is that yesterday afternoon

840
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,000
我们和Symmington先生在教室里喝茶
we were having tea with Mr Symmington up in the schoolroom

841
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,000
就在那时候 Burton先生 那个可怜的女孩儿
and all the time, Mr Burton, that poor girl was

842
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,100
被人像渡渡鸟一样塞进橱柜里
squashed into that cupboard, dead as a dodo.

843
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:58,600
谢谢
Thank you.

844
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,100
那上周是什么情况 Holland小姐
And what about the other week, Miss Holland?

845
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,700
你可以叫我Elsie
You can call me Elsie, you know.

846
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,100
好
Right.

847
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,500
不好意思 你问了什么
I'm sorry, what did you ask?

848
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:19,400
- 上周发生什么事了 - Symmington太太出事的那天...
- What happened last week? - The day Mrs Symmington...

849
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,000
是的
Yes.

850
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,300
她一直有午休的习惯
Well, she always rested after lunch, you see.
