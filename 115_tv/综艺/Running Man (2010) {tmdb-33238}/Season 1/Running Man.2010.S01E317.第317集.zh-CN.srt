1
00:00:06,582 --> 00:00:09,452
(There's an unexpected guest.)

2
00:00:09,552 --> 00:00:11,912
(There's someone at the door.)

3
00:00:12,452 --> 00:00:17,052
(Someone pulls an awful prank.)

4
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:19,082
(Why is this happening to them?)

5
00:00:19,182 --> 00:00:20,552
What's going on?

6
00:00:20,652 --> 00:00:24,112
(The shadow of vengeance is near.)

7
00:00:24,612 --> 00:00:28,182
(The Runjuring)

8
00:00:29,352 --> 00:00:31,582
Please go inside and fill in the questionnaire.

9
00:00:32,412 --> 00:00:33,412
Where?

10
00:00:34,252 --> 00:00:35,912
- Do you mean this one? - Yes.

11
00:00:36,712 --> 00:00:38,082
- Do I sit there and fill this in? - Yes.

12
00:00:38,352 --> 00:00:41,482
"What kind of theme would you like to try on Running Man?"

13
00:00:41,482 --> 00:00:45,612
(Are they answering a questionnaire even before the programme begins?)

14
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:47,382
"Where would you like to visit?"

15
00:00:47,782 --> 00:00:49,582
"What kind of theme would you like to try on Running Man?"

16
00:00:50,152 --> 00:00:51,382
I want a thriller special.

17
00:00:51,382 --> 00:00:52,612
(The Second Running Man questionnaire)

18
00:00:53,582 --> 00:00:56,782
(Seok Jin writes down his wishes.)

19
00:00:56,882 --> 00:00:58,012
Every...

20
00:00:58,082 --> 00:00:59,082
(Boom)

21
00:01:00,152 --> 00:01:01,952
(Screaming)

22
00:01:02,052 --> 00:01:05,152
(That really scared him.)

23
00:01:05,352 --> 00:01:06,652
My goodness.

24
00:01:08,182 --> 00:01:10,252
Gosh, you should've hung it properly.

25
00:01:10,782 --> 00:01:11,782
Every...

26
00:01:12,452 --> 00:01:13,882
cast member...

27
00:01:14,482 --> 00:01:15,882
could be...

28
00:01:16,682 --> 00:01:18,082
the suspect.

29
00:01:20,312 --> 00:01:21,652
Just like the movie, "The Neighbour".

30
00:01:21,782 --> 00:01:23,352
(Water drops on his head.)

31
00:01:23,852 --> 00:01:24,852
What was that?

32
00:01:24,882 --> 00:01:26,012
(Surprised)

33
00:01:26,952 --> 00:01:27,952
What happened?

34
00:01:27,952 --> 00:01:29,152
(Something just fell on my head.)

35
00:01:30,852 --> 00:01:33,152
What was that? Water just fell from the ceiling.

36
00:01:33,882 --> 00:01:34,882
It was water.

37
00:01:34,882 --> 00:01:38,352
(What's going on in this room?)

38
00:01:38,452 --> 00:01:41,052
"What kind of theme would you like to try on Running Man?"

39
00:01:41,152 --> 00:01:42,182
Oh, my goodness!

40
00:01:42,282 --> 00:01:43,312
(Oh, my goodness!)

41
00:01:43,382 --> 00:01:45,952
(He's shocked.)

42
00:01:50,452 --> 00:01:52,712
(It's giving him goosebumps.)

43
00:01:53,252 --> 00:01:54,452
Why did it fall?

44
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:56,182
My goodness!

45
00:01:56,252 --> 00:01:57,252
(Startled)

46
00:02:00,682 --> 00:02:02,382
(He's sniffing.)

47
00:02:02,482 --> 00:02:05,112
(What just touched my hand?)

48
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:10,482
(Ji Hyo enters the mysterious waiting room.)

49
00:02:10,482 --> 00:02:11,712
Hi, Ji Hyo.

50
00:02:12,682 --> 00:02:17,012
(She gargles her mouth to feel refreshed.)

51
00:02:17,112 --> 00:02:19,152
- What's this? - Please fill out the questionnaire.

52
00:02:19,452 --> 00:02:22,852
"What kind of theme would you like to try on Running Man?"

53
00:02:26,922 --> 00:02:28,652
(She screams.)

54
00:02:28,652 --> 00:02:30,682
My gosh.

55
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:32,582
What was that?

56
00:02:34,312 --> 00:02:36,922
Something feels wrong about this room.

57
00:02:37,682 --> 00:02:38,682
(Is this a haunted room?)

58
00:02:38,682 --> 00:02:39,882
I'm scared.

59
00:02:39,982 --> 00:02:41,422
(Is this a haunted room?)

60
00:02:41,512 --> 00:02:43,812
I feel like something is going to crawl out from under the sofa.

61
00:02:53,982 --> 00:02:57,782
(There's something weird about this room.)

62
00:02:58,952 --> 00:03:03,482
(Ji Hyo moves aside and starts filling out the questionnaire.)

63
00:03:05,312 --> 00:03:06,412
I'm done.

64
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,712
Please go to the next room.

65
00:03:14,212 --> 00:03:15,252
You can go.

66
00:03:15,912 --> 00:03:17,352
It's just a door.

67
00:03:18,512 --> 00:03:21,482
(Why does everything feel so eerie today?)

68
00:03:23,052 --> 00:03:26,352
(The members who've gone through this are waiting in the next room.)

69
00:03:26,752 --> 00:03:30,882
(They've all become quiet after the incident.)

70
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:34,782
If I scream when the door opens, would Ji Hyo be startled?

71
00:03:35,652 --> 00:03:37,252
If you scare her,

72
00:03:37,682 --> 00:03:39,952
would she slap you in the face or not?

73
00:03:40,582 --> 00:03:42,382
- I'll bet my entire fortune. - Really?

74
00:03:42,582 --> 00:03:44,152
- She'll definitely hit me. - Do you think so?

75
00:03:44,452 --> 00:03:45,982
She'll swear at him while hitting him.

76
00:03:46,212 --> 00:03:47,982
I'll bet on that, too.

77
00:03:48,412 --> 00:03:50,182
- She'll hit the back of his head... - Give it a try.

78
00:03:50,182 --> 00:03:51,482
or slap him in the face.

79
00:03:51,682 --> 00:03:54,412
- Grab her shoulders and scream. - Right.

80
00:03:54,852 --> 00:03:56,582
(Kwang Soo is nervous.)

81
00:03:57,212 --> 00:03:59,382
- Hi, Ji Hyo. - Something fell off, right?

82
00:03:59,512 --> 00:04:02,012
- Yes. What was it? - What fell off?

83
00:04:04,382 --> 00:04:09,352
(She screams and swears at him.)

84
00:04:09,652 --> 00:04:11,082
(I'm sorry.)

85
00:04:11,482 --> 00:04:14,722
- You were right. - Look at her facial expression.

86
00:04:15,112 --> 00:04:18,052
- I was right. I kept my fortune. - You were right.

87
00:04:18,412 --> 00:04:20,052
- I'll protect my own fortune. - Good job.

88
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:21,082
Come and sit down.

89
00:04:21,282 --> 00:04:22,312
- You were right. - That's right.

90
00:04:22,312 --> 00:04:24,752
- I knew it. - Your prediction was right.

91
00:04:25,112 --> 00:04:27,152
What's with that room anyway?

92
00:04:27,252 --> 00:04:29,152
- I don't know. - I don't know, either.

93
00:04:29,152 --> 00:04:30,512
I've been waiting here without knowing what's going on.

94
00:04:30,512 --> 00:04:31,782
(What is going on in that room?)

95
00:04:32,352 --> 00:04:33,982
What was that? What are we going to do today?

96
00:04:34,182 --> 00:04:35,882
(All the cast members enter through the mysterious room.)

97
00:04:35,882 --> 00:04:37,812
- Hello, everyone. - Hi, Gary.

98
00:04:38,082 --> 00:04:40,282
- What was that? - I think something is in there.

99
00:04:41,252 --> 00:04:42,382
What's going on?

100
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:43,952
(I have a bad feeling.)

101
00:04:44,682 --> 00:04:47,552
Everyone, before I tell you...

102
00:04:48,152 --> 00:04:51,882
about today's race, I'll introduce you to a special guest.

103
00:04:51,982 --> 00:04:53,082
- Okay. - I see.

104
00:04:53,182 --> 00:04:56,612
Please come out. In 1, 2, 3!

105
00:04:57,382 --> 00:04:58,882
- What's going on? - What's happening?

106
00:04:59,612 --> 00:05:01,682
(Everyone is startled.)

107
00:05:01,882 --> 00:05:03,682
- What's going on? - What's happening?

108
00:05:03,852 --> 00:05:05,222
(Oh...)

109
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,512
(my...)

110
00:05:06,512 --> 00:05:07,682
(gosh.)

111
00:05:09,382 --> 00:05:11,482
(They fall backwards.)

112
00:05:12,182 --> 00:05:15,082
(They take a deep bow backwards.)

113
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,552
- My goodness. - What just happened?

114
00:05:17,682 --> 00:05:19,282
(Why do they have to greet the guest like this?)

115
00:05:19,282 --> 00:05:21,482
- Welcome! - Who is that?

116
00:05:21,782 --> 00:05:25,412
(He looks familiar. Who is he?)

117
00:05:25,512 --> 00:05:27,082
- It's nice to meet you all. - Isn't that Gyeong Gyu?

118
00:05:27,482 --> 00:05:30,152
(Lee Gyeong Gyu, the king of variety show with a 36-year experience)

119
00:05:30,352 --> 00:05:31,582
- I lost again. - Look!

120
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:36,282
(Gyeong Gyu challenged the cast members three months ago.)

121
00:05:36,282 --> 00:05:38,682
(His challenge ended in a disastrous and humiliating defeat.)

122
00:05:38,682 --> 00:05:41,512
He tried to protect his name tag, but he lost it.

123
00:05:41,512 --> 00:05:43,682
I'll abandon all of my team members and challenge you again...

124
00:05:43,952 --> 00:05:45,012
by myself.

125
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,212
(He's back for revenge.)

126
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:48,612
My goodness!

127
00:05:48,612 --> 00:05:53,582
(The Runjuring was only a taste of Gyeong Gyu's revenge.)

128
00:05:53,882 --> 00:05:54,882
You're joking, right?

129
00:05:54,882 --> 00:05:57,512
(Everyone, look forward to my revenge.)

130
00:05:57,682 --> 00:05:59,612
- Was it a hidden camera prank? - Hello.

131
00:05:59,612 --> 00:06:01,152
- Hello, Gyeong Gyu. - Welcome, everyone.

132
00:06:01,282 --> 00:06:02,412
I can't believe this.

133
00:06:02,512 --> 00:06:03,712
(No wonder I had a bad feeling.)

134
00:06:04,152 --> 00:06:07,652
(I never knew Gyeong Gyu would come back.)

135
00:06:07,752 --> 00:06:09,582
(That means...)

136
00:06:09,582 --> 00:06:12,982
- We'll go home early today! - Oh, yes!

137
00:06:13,452 --> 00:06:15,582
(We'll go home early today thanks to Gyeong Gyu.)

138
00:06:15,582 --> 00:06:17,712
I knew you would come back. I knew it.

139
00:06:17,712 --> 00:06:20,582
- I'm here to celebrate Chuseok. - It's the Chuseok Special.

140
00:06:20,582 --> 00:06:22,182
- It's the Chuseok Special. - That's right.

141
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:23,982
I'm here to redeem my defeat.

142
00:06:23,982 --> 00:06:25,982
- You're rechallenging us? - That's right.

143
00:06:25,982 --> 00:06:27,482
- Did you form a team again? - Again?

144
00:06:27,482 --> 00:06:29,182
- Yes, I formed a new team. - I see.

145
00:06:29,382 --> 00:06:31,252
- I formed a new team. - His last team was very strong.

146
00:06:31,252 --> 00:06:33,282
- We caught even Kim Dong Hyun. - Exactly.

147
00:06:33,282 --> 00:06:36,352
- My new team is very strong. - Is that so?

148
00:06:36,582 --> 00:06:39,252
- I removed all the weak members. - Yes.

149
00:06:40,052 --> 00:06:42,812
- You found faster people? - I found new members.

150
00:06:43,282 --> 00:06:44,612
- I'm excited to meet them. - Right.

151
00:06:44,882 --> 00:06:47,782
Today's theme is Running Man versus Avengers Part Two.

152
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:48,982
It's the second part.

153
00:06:48,982 --> 00:06:50,082
(Running Man vs Avengers Part 2)

154
00:06:50,082 --> 00:06:53,882
You'll have a match with Team Avengers who became stronger.

155
00:06:54,282 --> 00:06:56,582
The winning team will be decided...

156
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,212
through Name Tag Elimination at the end.

157
00:06:59,582 --> 00:07:00,782
- Name Tag Elimination? - Like last time.

158
00:07:00,882 --> 00:07:04,152
Each team gets to choose the lucky and unlucky members...

159
00:07:04,252 --> 00:07:06,582
who will be given special missions.

160
00:07:06,882 --> 00:07:09,282
Before the final match, the team that wins the first round...

161
00:07:09,282 --> 00:07:11,412
will be given a hint about the other team's lucky and unlucky members.

162
00:07:11,582 --> 00:07:13,812
So it's very important to win the first round.

163
00:07:14,082 --> 00:07:16,452
The winning team will receive the golden shield.

164
00:07:16,782 --> 00:07:19,982
The leader of the losing team and the member the leader chooses...

165
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:22,312
will be hit on the forehead by the other team.

166
00:07:22,882 --> 00:07:24,852
- That's the penalty. - Gyeong Gyu, will that be okay?

167
00:07:24,852 --> 00:07:27,512
- Can we hit Gyeong Gyu, as well? - Do you expect us to hit him?

168
00:07:27,612 --> 00:07:30,282
- Yes, you can. - I can't even imagine...

169
00:07:30,282 --> 00:07:31,682
hitting Gyeong Gyu on his forehead.

170
00:07:31,682 --> 00:07:33,582
- I'll try my best to win. - I can't hit him.

171
00:07:33,952 --> 00:07:37,412
(You don't have to worry about that.)

172
00:07:37,512 --> 00:07:41,552
(I brought the strongest team for my revenge.)

173
00:07:42,852 --> 00:07:44,882
I'm nervous to meet his team.

174
00:07:45,082 --> 00:07:46,482
His team was great last time.

175
00:07:46,582 --> 00:07:48,752
- That's right. - They were very strong.

176
00:07:48,752 --> 00:07:50,982
- They were strong, indeed. - But we won.

177
00:07:50,982 --> 00:07:53,212
(Last time was like an appetiser.)

178
00:07:53,212 --> 00:07:58,052
(This time will be like a full course meal.)

179
00:07:59,082 --> 00:08:01,082
- All right! - What's that?

180
00:08:01,082 --> 00:08:02,482
(The members of Team Avengers will be revealed.)

181
00:08:03,582 --> 00:08:04,782
- What's that? - Who is that?

182
00:08:05,082 --> 00:08:06,812
- Hi, Hye Jin. - My goodness.

183
00:08:07,082 --> 00:08:09,552
- It's Hye Jin. - It's been a long time.

184
00:08:10,412 --> 00:08:12,552
(Han Hye Jin, Team Avengers)

185
00:08:13,512 --> 00:08:15,112
- Welcome. - Hello.

186
00:08:15,782 --> 00:08:17,282
Congratulations on the birth of your baby.

187
00:08:17,482 --> 00:08:20,052
- Thank you. - How have you been?

188
00:08:20,112 --> 00:08:22,482
- How have you been? - It's been a really long time.

189
00:08:22,582 --> 00:08:23,682
It's good to see Hye Jin again.

190
00:08:23,852 --> 00:08:25,482
- Since the last time she was here, - Hello.

191
00:08:25,482 --> 00:08:27,082
- "Healing Camp". - Hye Jin...

192
00:08:27,082 --> 00:08:30,582
got married and everything. You two hosted "Healing Camp".

193
00:08:30,582 --> 00:08:31,882
- That's right. - We hosted the show together.

194
00:08:31,882 --> 00:08:34,082
- They hosted it with Kim Je Dong. - That's why it's "Killing Camp".

195
00:08:34,212 --> 00:08:36,912
- It reads, "Killing Camp". - That's right.

196
00:08:37,252 --> 00:08:39,512
The first round is "Killing Camp".

197
00:08:39,682 --> 00:08:41,382
"Don't Say the First Place".

198
00:08:41,682 --> 00:08:43,682
The team that guesses more answers...

199
00:08:43,682 --> 00:08:47,052
that are ranked from the 2nd to the 6th in the poll wins.

200
00:08:47,452 --> 00:08:50,682
As soon as the quiz ends, we'll begin "Running Rumble".

201
00:08:50,882 --> 00:08:52,782
The team who wins the first three points can...

202
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,682
eliminate a member from the other team from "Running Rumble".

203
00:08:55,882 --> 00:08:58,982
(The first team to win three points can remove the other team's member.)

204
00:08:58,982 --> 00:09:01,712
(We'll have a chance of winning if we eliminate the ace.)

205
00:09:01,712 --> 00:09:02,882
- I can't believe this. - Right after the quiz?

206
00:09:02,882 --> 00:09:03,982
They get to eliminate one of us.

207
00:09:03,982 --> 00:09:07,252
The team will have one less member in "Running Rumble".

208
00:09:07,512 --> 00:09:08,852
What are these boxes?

209
00:09:08,952 --> 00:09:11,852
- I think people are in there. - What are the boxes?

210
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:13,582
- They need more members. - Only one member of...

211
00:09:13,882 --> 00:09:15,612
- Team Avengers has been revealed. - That's right.

212
00:09:15,852 --> 00:09:18,382
The rest of the members are hidden in those boxes.

213
00:09:18,482 --> 00:09:20,822
- Is that so? - They're moving in the boxes.

214
00:09:21,382 --> 00:09:22,482
You can't lock people in boxes like this.

215
00:09:22,482 --> 00:09:24,082
Why do you keep moving in there?

216
00:09:24,082 --> 00:09:26,382
- I wonder who are in there. - The fifth box moved a lot.

217
00:09:26,582 --> 00:09:28,412
The more the box is moving,

218
00:09:28,612 --> 00:09:31,652
the stronger the person inside of the box is.

219
00:09:32,712 --> 00:09:34,652
- The 3rd box is moving a lot. - I wonder who's in the 5th box.

220
00:09:34,752 --> 00:09:35,882
The 3rd and 5th box.

221
00:09:36,052 --> 00:09:38,412
Each time you get the right answer,

222
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:41,582
you can open 1 cell in 1 of the boxes.

223
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,782
- I understand. - You can guess who is in the boxes.

224
00:09:43,782 --> 00:09:45,252
- That sounds fun. - I see.

225
00:09:45,582 --> 00:09:47,282
That way, you can eliminate one of the members.

226
00:09:47,382 --> 00:09:49,652
When Gyeong Gyu and Hye Jin get the right answer...

227
00:09:49,782 --> 00:09:51,112
Do you see the roulette?

228
00:09:51,852 --> 00:09:53,412
- They get to... - They choose a member with it?

229
00:09:53,482 --> 00:09:56,282
put the name tag of the member they want to remove on the roulette.

230
00:09:56,452 --> 00:09:57,782
They can choose the member they wish to eliminate...

231
00:09:57,782 --> 00:09:59,782
- I see more Seok Jin and me. - by spinning the roulette.

232
00:09:59,982 --> 00:10:01,352
It seems like it has more of my name tags on there.

233
00:10:01,352 --> 00:10:03,212
They'll put a lot of Jong Kook's name tags on there.

234
00:10:04,252 --> 00:10:06,582
- You lose if you say the top rank. - Okay.

235
00:10:06,782 --> 00:10:07,952
- Let's begin. - Okay.

236
00:10:08,112 --> 00:10:10,322
- Please show us the question. - We shouldn't say the first place.

237
00:10:10,412 --> 00:10:11,822
- "The most common baby nickname". - "The most common baby nickname".

238
00:10:11,952 --> 00:10:13,112
Hold on.

239
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:16,682
This poll was conducted in 2015.

240
00:10:16,852 --> 00:10:18,582
- Did your baby have a nickname? - She knows the answer.

241
00:10:18,782 --> 00:10:20,982
- Lucky. - That must be the first place.

242
00:10:20,982 --> 00:10:22,322
- It might be the first place. - I hope it's not.

243
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:23,612
- I hope it's not. - Did you say "Lucky"?

244
00:10:23,612 --> 00:10:24,912
- I hope it's the first place. - It's not on the list?

245
00:10:24,952 --> 00:10:26,152
- It's not in the top six? - It's not on the list?

246
00:10:26,152 --> 00:10:28,822
- Is it not on the list? - It's not on the list.

247
00:10:29,152 --> 00:10:30,152
Sparky.

248
00:10:30,252 --> 00:10:32,282
- Who would use that nickname? - I don't think it's on the list.

249
00:10:32,282 --> 00:10:33,382
Sparky.

250
00:10:33,582 --> 00:10:35,252
- Lovely must be the first place. - Jae Seok.

251
00:10:35,482 --> 00:10:37,382
- Lovely. - That must be the first place.

252
00:10:37,482 --> 00:10:39,282
- I'm sure it's the first place. - Is it the first place?

253
00:10:39,382 --> 00:10:40,482
- What's the ranking? - Is it the first place?

254
00:10:40,482 --> 00:10:42,682
(It sounds very friendly. It feels like the first place.)

255
00:10:42,682 --> 00:10:43,982
- Lovely. - Lovely.

256
00:10:44,112 --> 00:10:47,282
- It's not in the top 2? - It was ranked the 2nd in 2016.

257
00:10:47,382 --> 00:10:49,512
- Really? Goodness. - This one was conducted in 2015.

258
00:10:49,612 --> 00:10:51,782
- I think this name is on the list. - Go ahead.

259
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:53,252
- Joy. - Joy.

260
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:55,052
- Joy. - It must be on the list.

261
00:10:55,052 --> 00:10:56,252
- Did he get it right? - What ranking is it?

262
00:10:56,252 --> 00:10:57,482
- It's not the first place, right? - Isn't it the first place?

263
00:10:57,482 --> 00:11:00,152
(What ranking could "Joy" be?)

264
00:11:00,612 --> 00:11:02,512
- It's the first place. - Oh, yes! I told you so.

265
00:11:02,552 --> 00:11:04,082
- It's the first place. - Oh, yes! I told you so.

266
00:11:04,082 --> 00:11:05,352
(One team is happy while the other is sad.)

267
00:11:05,352 --> 00:11:07,682
- I can't believe him. - I knew it.

268
00:11:08,152 --> 00:11:10,712
(He said the answer that he had to avoid.)

269
00:11:10,812 --> 00:11:12,852
- How did you get that? - Gosh.

270
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,552
- I'm sorry. - See? I told you.

271
00:11:15,552 --> 00:11:17,452
- I was about to call out Awesome. - I told you, Hye Jin.

272
00:11:17,452 --> 00:11:20,382
- I told you. It's 2 versus 1. - I'm really sorry.

273
00:11:20,382 --> 00:11:22,352
- I really didn't know. - I didn't pick Joy for a reason.

274
00:11:22,412 --> 00:11:23,682
- It was so obvious. - Was it?

275
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:26,112
- I didn't have a baby nickname. - Didn't you?

276
00:11:26,112 --> 00:11:27,712
- Did you have one, Hye Jin? - I had one.

277
00:11:27,752 --> 00:11:28,812
- What was it? - What was it?

278
00:11:29,012 --> 00:11:30,382
- It's quite embarrassing, though. - Please tell us.

279
00:11:30,412 --> 00:11:31,582
It was Boxing.

280
00:11:31,582 --> 00:11:33,212
- Boxing? - Really?

281
00:11:33,212 --> 00:11:36,552
- I got pregnant on the Boxing Day. - Oh, the Boxing Day?

282
00:11:36,582 --> 00:11:38,112
- On the Boxing Day? - I see.

283
00:11:38,212 --> 00:11:39,952
- That's why you named her Boxing. - What's the Boxing Day?

284
00:11:40,012 --> 00:11:42,282
- The day following Christmas Day. - I see.

285
00:11:42,282 --> 00:11:44,052
- That Boxing Day? - Yes.

286
00:11:44,312 --> 00:11:46,552
- I see. - I've never heard of such name.

287
00:11:46,712 --> 00:11:48,452
(This is embarrassing.)

288
00:11:48,752 --> 00:11:50,452
Seok Jin. Did you have a baby nickname?

289
00:11:50,452 --> 00:11:51,682
I don't think I had one.

290
00:11:51,682 --> 00:11:53,182
- Really? Seok Jin? - No baby name for you? Really?

291
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,452
- How about Joseon? - Joseon?

292
00:11:54,482 --> 00:11:56,752
- How about Liberation? - Liberation? No way.

293
00:11:56,752 --> 00:11:58,882
How about Dumbell for Jong Kook's future baby?

294
00:11:58,912 --> 00:12:00,512
- Dumbbell? - Dumbbell sounds good.

295
00:12:00,782 --> 00:12:02,312
For twins, how about Dumbbell and Barbell?

296
00:12:02,312 --> 00:12:03,752
- It sounds great. - Barbell.

297
00:12:03,782 --> 00:12:06,182
- We should remove a name. - Let's put Jong Kook's name on.

298
00:12:06,452 --> 00:12:07,812
Where should we put it on?

299
00:12:08,012 --> 00:12:10,082
Right here. Let's put this over Seok Jin's name.

300
00:12:10,482 --> 00:12:12,852
(We are taking Seok Jin out.)

301
00:12:12,912 --> 00:12:15,452
Why was his name placed right next to mine?

302
00:12:15,482 --> 00:12:17,312
Hye Jin thinks Ji Hyo is a tougher opponent than Seok Jin.

303
00:12:17,482 --> 00:12:19,782
Hye Jin seems quite tough. She even named her daughter Boxing.

304
00:12:20,512 --> 00:12:22,052
She is really cautious.

305
00:12:22,352 --> 00:12:24,312
- Let's move on to the next topic. - All right.

306
00:12:24,512 --> 00:12:26,252
- Let's see. - We must avoid the top answer.

307
00:12:27,052 --> 00:12:29,582
"What are the most popular kind of SNS profile pictures?"

308
00:12:29,612 --> 00:12:32,112
- We must know better than them. - What is it? SNS profile pictures?

309
00:12:33,782 --> 00:12:36,212
- Scenery pictures. - Yes. They are really popular.

310
00:12:36,512 --> 00:12:37,852
- Scenery. - Photos of sky, for example.

311
00:12:37,852 --> 00:12:39,252
- Scenery pictures... - Yes.

312
00:12:39,452 --> 00:12:40,682
- are second most popular. - Yes.

313
00:12:41,312 --> 00:12:43,152
- That was close. - Good one.

314
00:12:43,152 --> 00:12:44,582
Don't pick the usual ones.

315
00:12:44,582 --> 00:12:45,712
- It was really close. - So please don't.

316
00:12:45,752 --> 00:12:47,712
Scenery pictures are the second popular profile pictures.

317
00:12:47,712 --> 00:12:48,982
Since you got the right answer,

318
00:12:48,982 --> 00:12:50,252
(Haha can remove a sticker.)

319
00:12:50,382 --> 00:12:53,582
- please choose a sticker to remove. - I'll choose box five.

320
00:12:54,152 --> 00:12:55,352
Sticker number three.

321
00:12:55,512 --> 00:12:57,012
- I'll choose 3 of box 5. - You chose 3 of box 5.

322
00:12:57,252 --> 00:12:58,452
- What is it? - Why?

323
00:12:58,482 --> 00:13:00,252
- I can see feet. - That person must be a man.

324
00:13:00,282 --> 00:13:01,682
- What is that? - He must be sitting.

325
00:13:01,682 --> 00:13:03,012
- I can't see any. - He must be lying down.

326
00:13:03,052 --> 00:13:04,452
- He's lying down. - You can only see his feet.

327
00:13:04,482 --> 00:13:06,612
- Look at his feet. They are big. - You can see big feet?

328
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:09,482
He must be really uncomfortable to stay in the box like that.

329
00:13:09,852 --> 00:13:11,412
Let's remove sticker six next time.

330
00:13:11,412 --> 00:13:12,482
That posture looks so uncomfortable.

331
00:13:12,482 --> 00:13:13,612
Don't guess the first place.

332
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:14,782
Baby photos.

333
00:13:15,152 --> 00:13:16,812
- That must be the most popular. - Baby photos.

334
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:17,882
- It must be. - No way.

335
00:13:17,952 --> 00:13:19,012
I think selfies are the top of the list.

336
00:13:19,282 --> 00:13:20,482
- Yes, selfies could be the top. - First place.

337
00:13:20,712 --> 00:13:22,152
- Yes. - It's okay if it's not the first.

338
00:13:22,212 --> 00:13:23,312
- It can't be the first. - Let's see.

339
00:13:23,482 --> 00:13:24,882
It's fourth on the list.

340
00:13:25,452 --> 00:13:27,052
- Good job. - Nice.

341
00:13:27,612 --> 00:13:29,582
- Pictures of family members. - I see.

342
00:13:30,082 --> 00:13:31,582
Let's pick 5 of box 5.

343
00:13:31,612 --> 00:13:33,852
- Sticker 5 of box 5? - It won't reveal his face.

344
00:13:33,882 --> 00:13:35,152
Do you want to see the face?

345
00:13:36,152 --> 00:13:37,152
I can almost see though.

346
00:13:37,182 --> 00:13:39,252
- That shirt is out of style. - I have no idea.

347
00:13:39,312 --> 00:13:40,312
Hey. Hide your hands.

348
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:41,482
I can tell makeup is very lovely.

349
00:13:41,552 --> 00:13:43,082
- That person must be a woman. - A woman?

350
00:13:43,112 --> 00:13:44,582
- No way. It's a man. - Hide your hands.

351
00:13:44,612 --> 00:13:46,482
- No, I think it's a woman. - I can see makeup on the hands.

352
00:13:46,582 --> 00:13:47,582
That must be a man.

353
00:13:47,752 --> 00:13:49,412
- How about pictures of coffee? - Pictures of coffee?

354
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:50,912
- No way. - Pictures of Justin Bieber.

355
00:13:50,912 --> 00:13:52,552
- They pressed first. - Pictures of Justin Beiber.

356
00:13:53,052 --> 00:13:54,952
- Selfies. - Selifies, selfies.

357
00:13:55,052 --> 00:13:56,712
- Haha. - Do you mean selfies?

358
00:13:57,312 --> 00:14:01,452
(Wait, selfies are really popular profile pictures.)

359
00:14:01,582 --> 00:14:02,712
- Wait... - It must be the first place.

360
00:14:02,752 --> 00:14:04,452
- What are you doing? - It's the first.

361
00:14:04,582 --> 00:14:07,052
- No, I didn't mean selfies. - It's the first?

362
00:14:07,082 --> 00:14:08,652
- I meant pictures of me, Haha. - It ranks third.

363
00:14:08,652 --> 00:14:10,552
(It ranks third.)

364
00:14:11,482 --> 00:14:13,912
- Gosh, Haha. - Oh dear, I'm so relieved.

365
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:17,252
- Selfies? Really? Only the third? - That's right.

366
00:14:17,282 --> 00:14:18,282
- No way. - I thought selfies are the first.

367
00:14:18,312 --> 00:14:19,652
- Selfies are not the 1st? - What's ranked 1st then?

368
00:14:19,752 --> 00:14:22,312
Let's try the third box. Shall we?

369
00:14:22,412 --> 00:14:23,552
Okay. Sticker 6 of box 3, please.

370
00:14:23,552 --> 00:14:24,852
- Sticker 6 of box 3? - Yes. That's it.

371
00:14:24,852 --> 00:14:26,452
- Let's see the face. - We're removing sticker six.

372
00:14:26,482 --> 00:14:27,952
But they're not all lying down, right?

373
00:14:28,552 --> 00:14:29,782
I can see the hips.

374
00:14:30,752 --> 00:14:32,812
- That must be a man. - I think all of them are men.

375
00:14:32,912 --> 00:14:34,252
His thighs are something.

376
00:14:34,282 --> 00:14:36,182
- One of them must be Sung Hoon. - The thighs look really thick.

377
00:14:36,182 --> 00:14:37,252
(Thick thighs)

378
00:14:37,352 --> 00:14:41,082
(Hang on, I've seen those thighs.)

379
00:14:41,482 --> 00:14:43,252
I can't see properly.

380
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:44,812
- Is he tall? - All right.

381
00:14:44,852 --> 00:14:46,112
Photos of delicious food.

382
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,912
- Food? - Yes. Food.

383
00:14:47,912 --> 00:14:48,952
- Food? - Yes.

384
00:14:48,982 --> 00:14:50,482
- It must be on the list. - Yes, it must be.

385
00:14:50,552 --> 00:14:51,682
- It might be the first. - Is it on the list?

386
00:14:51,712 --> 00:14:53,152
- I think it's the 5th. - It's ranked 6th.

387
00:14:53,182 --> 00:14:54,312
- Yes. - Okay.

388
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:58,182
- Good job. - Seok Jin. Let's try 5 of box 3.

389
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:01,512
- Sticker 5 of box 3? Okay. - Sticker 5 of box 3?

390
00:15:01,552 --> 00:15:03,482
Okay. We'll remove the 5th sticker on the 3rd box.

391
00:15:04,482 --> 00:15:06,382
- Who is that? - He's hiding himself.

392
00:15:07,252 --> 00:15:09,182
- It's Moon Hee Jun. - Yes, it's Hee Jun.

393
00:15:10,112 --> 00:15:12,882
(Peekaboo! How did you guys figure out?)

394
00:15:12,952 --> 00:15:14,152
You shouldn't do that.

395
00:15:14,582 --> 00:15:17,152
(Team Avengers, Moon Hee Jun)

396
00:15:18,012 --> 00:15:19,052
What a surprise.

397
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,982
- Hello, Hee Jun. - It's Hee Jun.

398
00:15:23,612 --> 00:15:24,752
He should be in the team.

399
00:15:25,152 --> 00:15:26,252
- Is he strong? - Aim for the fifth.

400
00:15:26,312 --> 00:15:29,452
(There're only 2 left now. The 1st and 5th.)

401
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:30,652
Default pictures.

402
00:15:30,652 --> 00:15:32,352
Default profile pictures given by the system.

403
00:15:32,482 --> 00:15:33,652
Default profile pictures?

404
00:15:34,252 --> 00:15:35,282
- Yes. - It's on the list.

405
00:15:35,282 --> 00:15:36,412
- Yes. - That's good.

406
00:15:36,982 --> 00:15:38,212
- That must be the first place. - The basic profile picture.

407
00:15:38,212 --> 00:15:40,182
- It must be the 1st place. - It is ranked the 1st.

408
00:15:40,452 --> 00:15:43,052
(Kwang Soo picks the first of all things.)

409
00:15:43,112 --> 00:15:44,382
I told you, right?

410
00:15:44,512 --> 00:15:45,812
We don't have to do anything to win.

411
00:15:46,252 --> 00:15:48,882
- Come on. - I knew it was the first.

412
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:51,182
- Kwang Soo is really unlucky. - You're right.

413
00:15:51,352 --> 00:15:52,482
We don't have to do anything to win.

414
00:15:52,512 --> 00:15:54,452
- I told you, right? - It was so obvious.

415
00:15:54,482 --> 00:15:55,852
We'll win without doing anything.

416
00:15:56,512 --> 00:15:57,852
- Gosh. - I knew this.

417
00:15:58,182 --> 00:15:59,582
- I see. - Yes.

418
00:15:59,782 --> 00:16:01,382
- We don't need him there. - Him?

419
00:16:01,412 --> 00:16:03,252
Are you removing Seok Jin's name again?

420
00:16:03,352 --> 00:16:04,352
It's me?

421
00:16:04,382 --> 00:16:05,652
Is it Seok Jin again?

422
00:16:06,182 --> 00:16:07,552
- They're determined. - Gosh.

423
00:16:07,582 --> 00:16:09,582
There's only one left for Seok Jin's name.

424
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:12,712
We must eliminate Jong Kook from "Running Rumble".

425
00:16:14,312 --> 00:16:16,082
- He has profile pictures of us. - Profile pictures of all members?

426
00:16:16,112 --> 00:16:17,212
It's embarrassing.

427
00:16:17,312 --> 00:16:19,482
Gyeong Gyu is really showing off.

428
00:16:19,652 --> 00:16:21,752
- Really? - Is that your profile picture?

429
00:16:21,882 --> 00:16:23,012
Look.

430
00:16:23,012 --> 00:16:25,782
It's like a music album cover. There's even a title.

431
00:16:25,782 --> 00:16:28,112
My father's profile picture is very similar to his.

432
00:16:28,282 --> 00:16:31,352
- How did you even get this? - I know.

433
00:16:31,952 --> 00:16:33,312
Where's my privacy?

434
00:16:34,052 --> 00:16:36,212
- Come on. - You uploaded it to show everyone.

435
00:16:36,352 --> 00:16:38,452
Wait. Do they have to lie down like that all day?

436
00:16:39,052 --> 00:16:40,652
They must be keep tossing and turning.

437
00:16:41,312 --> 00:16:43,082
- It must be really hot inside. - My goodness.

438
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,512
Let's see who's next. Wow, this is great.

439
00:16:45,782 --> 00:16:46,852
Who's that?

440
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:49,112
"My precious Si On and Sung Yeung".

441
00:16:50,312 --> 00:16:51,382
That was ranked the fourth.

442
00:16:51,412 --> 00:16:52,982
- That's the kind. - Yes. Family photos.

443
00:16:53,482 --> 00:16:55,182
- Si On is Boxing, right? - Yes, she is.

444
00:16:55,712 --> 00:16:58,052
- Let's see who's next. - Who is it?

445
00:16:58,082 --> 00:17:00,752
- Is this the number one? - That's right.

446
00:17:00,912 --> 00:17:03,052
Yes. The most popular one. Default picture.

447
00:17:03,082 --> 00:17:04,782
I'm not interested in those kinds of profile photos.

448
00:17:04,812 --> 00:17:05,952
- That's not cool. - Gary.

449
00:17:05,982 --> 00:17:09,052
Don't you think your profile picture is too handsome for you?

450
00:17:10,352 --> 00:17:12,612
- Did you do that on purpose? - That's way too handsome.

451
00:17:12,652 --> 00:17:14,652
I think he went to the salon for that picture.

452
00:17:14,682 --> 00:17:16,982
Look. It's really neat. He definitely had a haircut.

453
00:17:17,482 --> 00:17:19,882
- Jae Seok, can we speed up? - Sure.

454
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:21,612
- They are suffering inside. - I see.

455
00:17:22,282 --> 00:17:24,912
- Look, they can't breathe. - I'm sorry.

456
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:27,382
This is the profile picture of Kwang Soo.

457
00:17:27,452 --> 00:17:29,752
- He's definitely showing off here. - Yes, I can tell.

458
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,112
- No, it's not that. - So, global prince?

459
00:17:31,112 --> 00:17:32,382
No. Not at all.

460
00:17:32,412 --> 00:17:35,152
- He wants to be popular worldwide. - I see.

461
00:17:35,182 --> 00:17:36,852
- Let's look at Haha's. - Look at that.

462
00:17:36,882 --> 00:17:40,482
Haha always shows his dream to everyone around him.

463
00:17:40,482 --> 00:17:41,552
(Haha wants to be tall.)

464
00:17:41,612 --> 00:17:44,152
- The impossible dream. - What is that?

465
00:17:44,182 --> 00:17:46,152
This picture says Haha wants to be tall like this guy.

466
00:17:46,452 --> 00:17:48,522
- A basketball player. - "Of course. I'm a genius."

467
00:17:49,052 --> 00:17:51,552
- It's like a real bluff. - My goodness.

468
00:17:51,752 --> 00:17:53,712
This is Seok Jin's.

469
00:17:53,882 --> 00:17:55,682
That's a typical 50s' profile.

470
00:17:56,312 --> 00:17:58,312
- Really. I mean it. - I agree.

471
00:17:58,682 --> 00:18:00,782
- Really. - That even embarrasses me.

472
00:18:00,812 --> 00:18:03,112
Men of his age always put pictures of them look young and active.

473
00:18:03,552 --> 00:18:04,952
- That's so typical. - "I am still active!"

474
00:18:05,182 --> 00:18:06,282
- That's right. - "I can do it."

475
00:18:06,382 --> 00:18:08,352
- He wants to show people that... - Gyeong Gyu's picture is similar.

476
00:18:08,352 --> 00:18:09,382
he's still healthy and active.

477
00:18:09,412 --> 00:18:11,252
Why did you put a picture of AOA members?

478
00:18:11,812 --> 00:18:14,482
- Look at their faces. - It's the picture with our faces.

479
00:18:14,522 --> 00:18:16,152
- Yes. It's with our faces. - I see.

480
00:18:16,352 --> 00:18:18,652
I thought it was a farewell message to your agency.

481
00:18:19,412 --> 00:18:21,882
(Seok Jin cancelled his contract with his agency after seven months.)

482
00:18:21,912 --> 00:18:23,652
It looks like a farewell message now.

483
00:18:24,482 --> 00:18:26,612
(Did you see my profile picture? How are you doing my friends?)

484
00:18:27,452 --> 00:18:29,382
"Things you never want to hear from your boss".

485
00:18:29,452 --> 00:18:30,552
- Can I begin? - Yes.

486
00:18:31,782 --> 00:18:33,612
"Get it done before you take off today."

487
00:18:34,852 --> 00:18:36,452
Is it on the list? It must be the sixth on the list.

488
00:18:36,552 --> 00:18:38,712
- It was ranked the sixth. - I see.

489
00:18:38,812 --> 00:18:40,612
- Shall we open up the 5th box? - Let's go with 6 of box 5.

490
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:41,682
- Okay. - All right.

491
00:18:41,712 --> 00:18:43,022
Who is that?

492
00:18:43,352 --> 00:18:44,752
- I'm curious. - I'm so curious.

493
00:18:44,752 --> 00:18:48,522
(With flowery shirt and makeup, who could it be?)

494
00:18:48,552 --> 00:18:49,582
- I'm curious. - I'm so curious.

495
00:18:49,652 --> 00:18:52,612
- It's you, Key. - It's Key?

496
00:18:53,252 --> 00:18:55,652
(Team Avengers, Key)

497
00:18:55,912 --> 00:18:58,752
With his face revealed, he looks really stylish with that shirt.

498
00:18:58,782 --> 00:18:59,782
Yes, he really does.

499
00:18:59,812 --> 00:19:03,282
My face is all swollen. I was afraid you wouldn't recognise me.

500
00:19:03,812 --> 00:19:05,812
Everything suits for a handsome guy, right?

501
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,522
(His flowery shirt suits him really well.)

502
00:19:09,852 --> 00:19:11,252
- "Do it again." - "Do it again?"

503
00:19:11,352 --> 00:19:12,852
That sounds annoying, but do people really say...

504
00:19:12,882 --> 00:19:14,782
- Really? - Is it on the list?

505
00:19:14,852 --> 00:19:16,552
- In our daily lives. - Let's go with the second box.

506
00:19:16,582 --> 00:19:18,712
- Box 2. - Box 2, sticker 6.

507
00:19:18,752 --> 00:19:20,312
- Box 2, cell 6. - Box 2, cell 6 please.

508
00:19:20,352 --> 00:19:21,552
Would this person be lying down as well?

509
00:19:21,582 --> 00:19:22,912
- I don't think so. - Let's find out.

510
00:19:22,982 --> 00:19:24,082
- This one is standing. - I know.

511
00:19:24,112 --> 00:19:25,182
It's pink.

512
00:19:25,252 --> 00:19:27,022
- The socks are in pink colour. - Then is it a woman?

513
00:19:27,022 --> 00:19:28,082
Is it a man or woman?

514
00:19:28,112 --> 00:19:29,382
- I don't have any idea. - This one is fashionable.

515
00:19:29,452 --> 00:19:32,212
- I think that person is a man. - It must be. We have Hye Jin here.

516
00:19:33,522 --> 00:19:34,952
"This is why you always fail."

517
00:19:35,082 --> 00:19:36,612
- That's why. - It sounds really horrible.

518
00:19:37,022 --> 00:19:39,082
- It's on the list? Really? - Isn't this...

519
00:19:39,152 --> 00:19:41,082
- Take the sticker 1 off. - Box 2, sticker 1 please.

520
00:19:41,252 --> 00:19:42,482
- Who is that? - Isn't it...

521
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:43,982
Gosh.

522
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:45,482
- Who is he? - Isn't he Roy Kim?

523
00:19:45,912 --> 00:19:47,652
- I'm so lost now. - Isn't he...

524
00:19:47,882 --> 00:19:49,982
- an actor? - Is he tall?

525
00:19:50,182 --> 00:19:52,052
- Isn't he Roy Kim? - I saw him, but I have no idea.

526
00:19:52,112 --> 00:19:53,582
- My goodness. - Isn't he Shin Sung Rok?

527
00:19:53,612 --> 00:19:56,052
- Isn't he the actor Shin Sung Rok? - No way.

528
00:19:57,912 --> 00:19:59,582
"I wasn't like that when I was your age."

529
00:20:00,482 --> 00:20:01,552
Okay.

530
00:20:01,582 --> 00:20:03,352
- Good. - Gosh. That sounds awful, too.

531
00:20:03,352 --> 00:20:05,522
Please open up box 2, sticker 2.

532
00:20:05,522 --> 00:20:06,652
Isn't he on our team?

533
00:20:06,712 --> 00:20:07,952
I really don't have any idea.

534
00:20:09,352 --> 00:20:10,752
Who is he?

535
00:20:11,112 --> 00:20:12,912
- Wait. Isn't he Sung Hoon? - Really?

536
00:20:12,952 --> 00:20:15,082
You can't change your posture. Are you okay with that?

537
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:17,582
Let's keep the stickers 3 and 4 untouched until the end.

538
00:20:18,482 --> 00:20:20,052
- Yes. - Let him stand like that.

539
00:20:20,082 --> 00:20:21,812
- We won't free you until the end. - No way.

540
00:20:21,812 --> 00:20:23,552
(Please remove the stickers.)

541
00:20:28,252 --> 00:20:29,582
"I need to talk to your parents."

542
00:20:29,612 --> 00:20:30,812
- What? - What are you talking about?

543
00:20:30,882 --> 00:20:32,612
- No way. - It's not about school kids.

544
00:20:32,712 --> 00:20:34,752
Nobody will bring in their parents to their workplaces.

545
00:20:35,952 --> 00:20:37,312
"Why are you so ugly?"

546
00:20:37,882 --> 00:20:38,982
Hateful comments on looks?

547
00:20:38,982 --> 00:20:39,982
(Wrong answer)

548
00:20:40,382 --> 00:20:41,852
"Actually, I like you."

549
00:20:41,882 --> 00:20:43,382
("Actually, I like you.")

550
00:20:43,412 --> 00:20:44,482
No?

551
00:20:45,652 --> 00:20:47,312
"I just don't like you."

552
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:48,812
("I just don't like you.")

553
00:20:48,852 --> 00:20:50,082
That was really straightforward.

554
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,052
- How about "Go away"? - Gyeong Gyu says it every day.

555
00:20:52,052 --> 00:20:54,282
(All of their answers are wrong.)

556
00:20:54,852 --> 00:20:56,852
"Just do as I say."

557
00:20:56,952 --> 00:20:58,312
"Do as I order."

558
00:20:58,482 --> 00:21:00,082
- That sounds like an answer. - That must be the first place.

559
00:21:00,082 --> 00:21:01,652
- That must be the 1st place. - Or the 2nd place.

560
00:21:03,022 --> 00:21:07,612
(It must be ranked either the 1st or the 2nd place.)

561
00:21:08,522 --> 00:21:09,522
That must be the first place.

562
00:21:09,652 --> 00:21:11,112
- First place. - First place.

563
00:21:11,112 --> 00:21:13,552
(He guessed the first place again.)

564
00:21:13,552 --> 00:21:15,352
This makes me feel annoyed.

565
00:21:15,452 --> 00:21:17,812
- It's so annoying. - Gosh, Kwang Soo.

566
00:21:17,812 --> 00:21:19,082
He got the first place right.

567
00:21:19,452 --> 00:21:20,982
I can't believe it.

568
00:21:21,582 --> 00:21:23,412
How did you pull it off?

569
00:21:24,152 --> 00:21:25,312
Your name is gone now, Seok Jin.

570
00:21:25,312 --> 00:21:26,452
Am I gone?

571
00:21:26,682 --> 00:21:28,852
Seok Jin must participate in the competition.

572
00:21:29,612 --> 00:21:32,312
- I have to compete no matter what. - You do.

573
00:21:33,182 --> 00:21:35,352
- I'm so curious. - Choose number four.

574
00:21:35,352 --> 00:21:37,312
- Number four, please come out. - He looks like someone.

575
00:21:37,312 --> 00:21:38,522
Who is number four?

576
00:21:39,022 --> 00:21:42,212
(Who is the person kept in the box throughout the show?)

577
00:21:43,312 --> 00:21:44,522
(It's Yoon Hyung Bin!)

578
00:21:44,522 --> 00:21:45,952
It's Yoon Hyung Bin.

579
00:21:45,952 --> 00:21:47,752
- It's Hyung Bin. - Hello.

580
00:21:47,752 --> 00:21:49,512
- He does mixed martial arts. - You're right.

581
00:21:49,512 --> 00:21:51,812
- Martial arts. - He'll be great.

582
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:53,412
(Team Avengers, Yoon Hyung Bin)

583
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:57,752
(He's a professional mixed martial artist in entertainment field.)

584
00:21:58,182 --> 00:21:59,912
I waited for a long time.

585
00:22:00,212 --> 00:22:01,552
Look how big his thighs are.

586
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:04,052
- He's never lost a game. - That's right.

587
00:22:04,052 --> 00:22:06,252
- He's never lost. - Can we let out number two?

588
00:22:06,252 --> 00:22:08,452
- It's Sung Hoon. - Sung Hoon?

589
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,982
(He finally sees light after being kept inside for an hour.)

590
00:22:12,012 --> 00:22:14,952
- He's pretty big. - He's sweating a lot.

591
00:22:15,712 --> 00:22:18,512
- I'm a fan of your drama. - He has a great body.

592
00:22:18,512 --> 00:22:19,682
His acting was good.

593
00:22:19,882 --> 00:22:22,382
(Team Avengers, Sung Hoon)

594
00:22:22,752 --> 00:22:24,152
Tell me it's not true.

595
00:22:24,152 --> 00:22:26,652
(Sung Hoon is a handsome actor with a hot body.)

596
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:28,912
- He has a great body. - I'm a fan of your drama.

597
00:22:28,952 --> 00:22:31,712
I watched his drama every day, but why didn't I recognise him?

598
00:22:32,012 --> 00:22:33,882
- Number 1. - Who's number 1?

599
00:22:33,882 --> 00:22:36,652
- I'm curious about number one. - Who on earth is it?

600
00:22:36,912 --> 00:22:38,112
Who is it? I can't see.

601
00:22:38,112 --> 00:22:40,112
(Is that a gorilla?)

602
00:22:40,112 --> 00:22:42,112
- It's Dong Hyun. - It's Dong Hyun.

603
00:22:42,952 --> 00:22:45,452
(Team Avengers, Kim Dong Hyun)

604
00:22:45,452 --> 00:22:48,012
Please give them a round of applause. Thank you.

605
00:22:48,352 --> 00:22:50,412
- Aren't they too strong? - They're too strong.

606
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:52,052
- It'll be very difficult. - They make a good team.

607
00:22:52,052 --> 00:22:55,382
As Team Avengers won, one of Running Man members...

608
00:22:55,382 --> 00:22:58,682
will be taken off the team when their name is chosen.

609
00:22:58,882 --> 00:23:00,982
It's okay as long as Jong Kook isn't chosen.

610
00:23:00,982 --> 00:23:03,812
Someone else has to be picked other than Jong Kook.

611
00:23:04,512 --> 00:23:06,452
It's a member that will be taken off the team.

612
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:08,012
I hope I'm chosen.

613
00:23:08,212 --> 00:23:10,452
It should be either Haha or Ji Hyo.

614
00:23:10,452 --> 00:23:12,882
- Gosh. - I hope it's me or Ji Hyo.

615
00:23:13,412 --> 00:23:15,182
This usually doesn't work in our favour.

616
00:23:15,182 --> 00:23:16,382
It's Jong Kook.

617
00:23:17,382 --> 00:23:19,312
- It's Jong Kook. - We're in trouble.

618
00:23:19,312 --> 00:23:22,152
- It's Jong Kook. - Oh, no.

619
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:23,582
(Kim Jong Kook)

620
00:23:25,712 --> 00:23:27,112
(It's not Jong Kook.)

621
00:23:27,182 --> 00:23:29,012
- What? - It's Ji Hyo.

622
00:23:30,112 --> 00:23:32,212
(It passes Jong Kook and Jae Seok.)

623
00:23:32,552 --> 00:23:34,212
- What? - It's Ji Hyo!

624
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,082
- It's Ji Hyo. - No way.

625
00:23:37,112 --> 00:23:39,312
- We're safe. - Thank goodness.

626
00:23:39,312 --> 00:23:40,912
(Ji Hyo is excluded from "Running Rumble".)

627
00:23:40,912 --> 00:23:43,452
- We still have Jong Kook. - We're safe.

628
00:23:43,812 --> 00:23:44,912
Thank goodness.

629
00:23:44,912 --> 00:23:46,482
Jae Seok can't be taken off, either.

630
00:23:46,482 --> 00:23:48,082
(Will Team Running Man be able to take revenge?)

631
00:23:53,312 --> 00:23:56,082
(It's a one-to-one competition with one member from each team.)

632
00:23:56,082 --> 00:23:59,552
(An additional member joins after every 30 seconds.)

633
00:23:59,552 --> 00:24:04,052
(The team to knock out all the opponents wins.)

634
00:24:04,052 --> 00:24:06,282
What if Dong Hyun uses his martial arts technique?

635
00:24:06,282 --> 00:24:07,682
- That's possible. - No way.

636
00:24:07,682 --> 00:24:09,182
Shouldn't we warm up?

637
00:24:09,182 --> 00:24:11,782
- We must win this game. - Let's warm up.

638
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:16,352
(The players ready to run away stretch their legs.)

639
00:24:17,212 --> 00:24:18,882
- Here we go. - You should stay focused.

640
00:24:18,882 --> 00:24:19,912
Me?

641
00:24:20,282 --> 00:24:23,212
- I work very hard. - Why are you being careless?

642
00:24:24,112 --> 00:24:25,952
Gyeong Gyu, I'm going to work very hard.

643
00:24:26,012 --> 00:24:28,652
Show me something then.

644
00:24:28,912 --> 00:24:30,582
Don't be careless. You must do your best.

645
00:24:30,582 --> 00:24:32,712
- I'll do my best. - You can do it.

646
00:24:32,712 --> 00:24:34,412
(In what order will Team Avengers compete?)

647
00:24:34,412 --> 00:24:35,812
Here's the countdown.

648
00:24:35,812 --> 00:24:37,882
- It's starting. - We can do it.

649
00:24:37,912 --> 00:24:40,082
- Jong Kook, please do well. - You can do it.

650
00:24:40,082 --> 00:24:42,312
(Everything will depend on who wins the first round.)

651
00:24:42,382 --> 00:24:45,412
- You can do it. - Please.

652
00:24:45,412 --> 00:24:48,282
(Who's the first player from each team?)

653
00:24:50,312 --> 00:24:55,312
(The first player from Team Running Man is Jong Kook.)

654
00:24:56,052 --> 00:24:58,082
- It's Jong Kook. - Is it Jong Kook?

655
00:24:58,182 --> 00:25:00,912
- He's definitely the first. - Right, it's the same.

656
00:25:00,982 --> 00:25:02,312
They have the same strategy.

657
00:25:03,182 --> 00:25:05,852
(First player from Team Avengers)

658
00:25:05,852 --> 00:25:07,112
He startled me.

659
00:25:07,152 --> 00:25:08,852
(It's UFC fighter, Kim Dong Hyun.)

660
00:25:09,812 --> 00:25:12,382
- Is it Dong Hyun? - Gosh. It is.

661
00:25:12,412 --> 00:25:14,552
- This will be hard. - All right.

662
00:25:15,712 --> 00:25:18,252
(Jong Kook vs Dong Hyun)

663
00:25:18,252 --> 00:25:21,082
- Is It Dong Hyun? - I knew you'd come.

664
00:25:21,082 --> 00:25:23,252
(It's a competition between the strongest member of each team.)

665
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,312
I thought it'd be you.

666
00:25:27,112 --> 00:25:28,452
(He trips and falls.)

667
00:25:29,582 --> 00:25:32,852
(He trips while trying to look cool.)

668
00:25:33,582 --> 00:25:35,982
(It's a chance for Jong Kook.)

669
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:39,682
(However, he stands up immediately.)

670
00:25:39,782 --> 00:25:41,552
I need to get rid of you quickly.

671
00:25:41,552 --> 00:25:42,852
I need to get rid of you.

672
00:25:42,852 --> 00:25:44,212
(It's a match between best players in their own field.)

673
00:25:45,612 --> 00:25:46,982
(Jong Kook grips him hard.)

674
00:25:46,982 --> 00:25:49,052
(Jong Kook makes a preemptive strike.)

675
00:25:49,282 --> 00:25:52,282
If Dong Hyun loses, we'll be at a disadvantage.

676
00:25:52,512 --> 00:25:54,112
It won't be easy to defeat him.

677
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:55,782
Jong Kook grabbed him.

678
00:25:56,312 --> 00:25:59,852
(Jong Kook holds down his collar and attacks with his right hand.)

679
00:26:00,482 --> 00:26:01,512
(Amazing)

680
00:26:01,512 --> 00:26:04,612
Jong Kook got closer to touching Dong Hyun's name tag.

681
00:26:05,552 --> 00:26:07,412
(Dong Hyun is at risk.)

682
00:26:07,412 --> 00:26:09,382
- This is so exciting. - What if he gets him?

683
00:26:09,382 --> 00:26:10,512
He's hanging in there.

684
00:26:10,512 --> 00:26:12,112
(Dong Hyun endures even though Jong Kook has him by the collar.)

685
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,282
Don't come near me.

686
00:26:13,282 --> 00:26:15,352
(The countdown for the second player to join starts.)

687
00:26:15,352 --> 00:26:17,052
What will you do if Hyung Bin joins?

688
00:26:17,612 --> 00:26:21,582
(Which player will join Jong Kook and Dong Hyun?)

689
00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:23,112
It's not safe.

690
00:26:23,112 --> 00:26:24,682
- Who's going in second? - Who's next?

691
00:26:24,682 --> 00:26:25,982
There you go.

692
00:26:26,282 --> 00:26:32,482
Five, four, three, two, one, zero.

693
00:26:32,582 --> 00:26:33,812
(The second players join.)

694
00:26:34,082 --> 00:26:37,282
Two, one, zero.

695
00:26:37,282 --> 00:26:39,812
(Which players will join to determine the winner?)

696
00:26:41,082 --> 00:26:45,582
(It's Lee Kwang Soo from Team Running Man...)

697
00:26:45,652 --> 00:26:47,812
(versus Yoon Hyung Bin of Team Avengers.)

698
00:26:47,812 --> 00:26:50,112
Grab him, grab him.

699
00:26:50,112 --> 00:26:51,612
Take off Hyung Bin's name tag.

700
00:26:51,612 --> 00:26:53,812
(It's Jong Kook versus Dong Hyun and Kwang Soo versus Hyung Bin.)

701
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:55,812
Oh, goodness.

702
00:26:57,882 --> 00:26:59,312
(Members who are watching get fired-up.)

703
00:26:59,312 --> 00:27:00,712
No, no.

704
00:27:02,052 --> 00:27:03,512
Kwang Soo, attack him.

705
00:27:04,652 --> 00:27:06,912
(While two battles are taking place...)

706
00:27:06,912 --> 00:27:08,482
You have long arms.

707
00:27:08,482 --> 00:27:09,652
(Jong Kook attacks him.)

708
00:27:09,652 --> 00:27:11,112
You have long arms.

709
00:27:12,582 --> 00:27:15,282
(Dong Hyun grabs the name tag.)

710
00:27:15,712 --> 00:27:17,082
(Tearing)

711
00:27:17,682 --> 00:27:19,282
(He tore Jong Kook's name tag.)

712
00:27:19,282 --> 00:27:20,582
You have long arms.

713
00:27:20,582 --> 00:27:23,482
(Dong Hyun takes off Jong Kook's name tag in an instant.)

714
00:27:23,482 --> 00:27:25,582
- I got it. - Over here, over here.

715
00:27:25,582 --> 00:27:26,912
Over here.

716
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:28,182
(Jong Kook is out.)

717
00:27:29,382 --> 00:27:30,452
Okay!

718
00:27:30,452 --> 00:27:32,382
(Well done, Dong Hyun!)

719
00:27:32,382 --> 00:27:34,652
- He took off the name tag. - He did it.

720
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:35,882
- He did it. - We got this.

721
00:27:35,882 --> 00:27:38,212
- He took off Jong Kook's name tag. - What happened?

722
00:27:38,352 --> 00:27:39,582
It's over for us.

723
00:27:39,582 --> 00:27:41,352
- Goodness. - Kwang Soo, hang in there.

724
00:27:41,352 --> 00:27:42,512
We're in trouble.

725
00:27:43,682 --> 00:27:45,412
(Now, it's Kwang Soo against Dong Hyun and Hyung Bin.)

726
00:27:45,412 --> 00:27:48,052
Grab him now. Go to the back.

727
00:27:48,052 --> 00:27:50,552
Grab it from the back. Take his name tag.

728
00:27:51,352 --> 00:27:52,512
(He defends himself with all his might.)

729
00:27:52,512 --> 00:27:53,712
No.

730
00:27:55,312 --> 00:27:59,082
(He has to withstand no matter what.)

731
00:27:59,752 --> 00:28:03,412
Three, two, one, zero.

732

(It's Gary versus Sung Hoon.)

734
00:28:09,812 --> 00:28:11,112
Hurry up.

735
00:28:11,452 --> 00:28:12,912
Hurry up.

736
00:28:12,912 --> 00:28:17,312
(Kwang Soo, wait. I'm coming for you.)

737
00:28:17,312 --> 00:28:18,312
(Tearing)

738
00:28:18,352 --> 00:28:19,352
He tore it.

739
00:28:19,352 --> 00:28:20,482
(Kwang Soo is out.)

740

They took off his name tag.

741
00:28:23,182 --> 00:28:24,252
(It's a match of 3 against 1.)

742
00:28:24,252 --> 00:28:25,682
What do I do now?

743
00:28:27,312 --> 00:28:28,912
Don't resist, Gary.

744
00:28:28,912 --> 00:28:31,152
Kwang Soo, why weren't you quicker?

745
00:28:31,552 --> 00:28:33,012
Don't even resist.

746
00:28:33,012 --> 00:28:34,652
Goodness, what should I do?

747
00:28:34,682 --> 00:28:37,682
(Defence is the only way to survive.)

748
00:28:37,752 --> 00:28:39,682
(His defence against three players is deft.)

749
00:28:39,812 --> 00:28:45,012
Four, three, two, one, zero.

750

00:28:46,212 --> 00:28:49,282
(It's Jae Seok versus Key.)

752
00:28:51,482 --> 00:28:53,052
- We're in trouble. - Wait.

753
00:28:53,152 --> 00:28:55,412
- We're in trouble. - Is your name tag torn off?

754
00:28:55,412 --> 00:28:57,982
- It's not off yet. - Stop it.

755
00:28:57,982 --> 00:29:00,012
(All Team Avengers members corner the other team.)

756
00:29:00,012 --> 00:29:01,182
We're in trouble.

757
00:29:01,182 --> 00:29:03,152
- Stop it. - Wait a minute.

758
00:29:03,152 --> 00:29:05,152
Their defence is incredible.

759
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,952
I'm trying to grab him.

760
00:29:06,952 --> 00:29:09,012
You can do it. We're already holding them down.

761
00:29:09,152 --> 00:29:10,482
Just tear it off.

762
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:12,182
(Jae Seok and Gary attack suddenly.)

763
00:29:12,182 --> 00:29:15,312
(But Sung Hoon and Hyung Bin react quickly.)

764
00:29:15,352 --> 00:29:17,182
Attack them.

765
00:29:17,182 --> 00:29:19,382
(They're cornered yet again.)

766
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,752
- Gosh, what's going on? - You want to play like this?

767
00:29:21,752 --> 00:29:22,812
(We can't survive on our own.)

768
00:29:22,812 --> 00:29:25,352
- Is this how you want to play? - New members are joining.

Gosh.

774

- No. - Watch out.

775
00:29:37,412 --> 00:29:39,012

(Seok Jin is out as soon as he joins.)

777
00:29:41,912 --> 00:29:43,212
- Goodness. - Seok Jin.

778
00:29:43,352 --> 00:29:45,282
Why did you even attack Seok Jin?

779
00:29:45,312 --> 00:29:47,282
(Seok Jin is out immediately.)

780
00:29:48,812 --> 00:29:50,182
(Oh, no.)

781
00:29:50,552 --> 00:29:52,452
What on earth was that?

782
00:29:53,512 --> 00:29:55,452
(They burst out laughing.)

783
00:29:56,582 --> 00:29:58,012
Oh, my goodness.

784
00:30:01,412 --> 00:30:04,112
(It's 2 Running Man versus 5 Avengers.)

785
00:30:04,112 --> 00:30:05,112
(Tearing)

786
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:08,252
(Hyung Bin tears off Gary's name tag.)

787
00:30:08,252 --> 00:30:09,712
Wait, what happened?

788
00:30:10,952 --> 00:30:13,582
(Sung Hoon eliminates Jae Seok.)

789
00:30:13,582 --> 00:30:15,352
(All Team Running Man members in the ring are eliminated.)

790
00:30:15,352 --> 00:30:16,382
Wait.

791
00:30:17,952 --> 00:30:21,112
(They've been playing "Name Tag Elimination" for six years.)

792
00:30:22,282 --> 00:30:24,212
(It's time for my revenge. I can't lose twice.)

793
00:30:24,212 --> 00:30:25,282
Come out.

794
00:30:26,252 --> 00:30:27,252
Come here.

795
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,982
(Only Haha remains on Team Running Man.)

796
00:30:30,012 --> 00:30:31,452
Is everyone else eliminated?

797
00:30:31,512 --> 00:30:34,452
(Seventh Avenger, Han Hye Jin appears.)

798
00:30:34,452 --> 00:30:37,752
- We predicted this would happen. - Don't do it.

799
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,882
(It's time to go, Haha.)

800
00:30:39,882 --> 00:30:41,552
- Turn him over. - Turn him over.

801
00:30:41,552 --> 00:30:42,882
- See you later, Haha. - Hold him.

802
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,512
(They deliver Haha to Hye Jin.)

803
00:30:45,082 --> 00:30:46,652
(Poor Haha.)

804
00:30:47,152 --> 00:30:50,982
(Hye Jin tears off his name tag elegantly.)

805
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:52,082
(Tearing)

806
00:30:52,452 --> 00:30:54,212
That was humiliating.

807
00:30:55,652 --> 00:30:58,312
- That was so embarrassing. - Goodness.

808
00:30:58,782 --> 00:31:01,182
How could they do that?

809
00:31:01,182 --> 00:31:03,112
He eliminated Jong Kook.

810
00:31:03,112 --> 00:31:05,952
- I wish we could play once more. - It's so unfair.

811
00:31:05,952 --> 00:31:08,612
Team Avengers wins.

812
00:31:08,612 --> 00:31:09,752
(Team Avengers is the winner of "Running Rumble".)

813
00:31:09,752 --> 00:31:13,452
- It's a complete defeat. - We got completely defeated.

814
00:31:13,652 --> 00:31:16,612
- That's too harsh. - Gosh, seriously.

815
00:31:19,652 --> 00:31:21,552
We were completely defeated today.

816
00:31:21,682 --> 00:31:23,382
We weren't this bad before.

817
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,982
Hyung Bin did much better than I thought.

818
00:31:27,082 --> 00:31:30,052
- He was very fast. - How did you think of me, then?

819
00:31:30,812 --> 00:31:33,182
- Seriously. - I thought you'd be easy.

820
00:31:33,982 --> 00:31:35,782
Hyung Bin worked out a lot.

821
00:31:35,982 --> 00:31:38,182
He was really fast but also frivolous at the same time.

822
00:31:38,452 --> 00:31:40,612
- He was too frivolous! - I know.

823
00:31:40,912 --> 00:31:44,182
- They've become too strong. - That's right.

824
00:31:44,282 --> 00:31:46,582
How could you eliminate the name tag that fast?

825
00:31:46,782 --> 00:31:49,812
I focused too much on the game and kind of lost my mind.

826
00:31:50,052 --> 00:31:52,912
I could see that when I saw your eyes flipping out.

827
00:31:53,382 --> 00:31:55,282
- He was seriously half crazy. - Gosh.

828
00:31:55,412 --> 00:31:57,512
- Sorry? - Why aren't you getting married?

829
00:31:57,712 --> 00:32:00,082
People told me to get married as late as possible.

830
00:32:00,412 --> 00:32:02,212
We didn't mean this late.

831
00:32:02,752 --> 00:32:03,982
You should've been married already by now.

832
00:32:03,982 --> 00:32:06,712
- Sorry? - Why don't you join "Mum's Diary"?

833
00:32:06,712 --> 00:32:09,552
- Me? - Are you casting him?

834
00:32:09,782 --> 00:32:11,052
I am a good son.

835
00:32:11,152 --> 00:32:13,382
- I'm scanning him now. - He's bad at things like that.

836
00:32:13,782 --> 00:32:16,512
I am very close with my mother.

837
00:32:16,612 --> 00:32:18,782
- He doesn't live alone. - He lives with his parents.

838
00:32:18,882 --> 00:32:20,882
Paparazzi gave up on him because he's so boring.

839
00:32:21,152 --> 00:32:23,882
He's either always at home or at the gym.

840
00:32:24,182 --> 00:32:27,052
You'll hear only three answers if you ask him what he's doing.

841
00:32:27,352 --> 00:32:29,082
"I'm on my way to the gym", "I'm working out" and...

842
00:32:29,082 --> 00:32:31,052
"I'm going home from the gym".

843
00:32:31,112 --> 00:32:34,182
He'll give you 1 out of these 3 answers.

844
00:32:34,182 --> 00:32:35,882
(They had a good time in the bus.)

845
00:32:36,712 --> 00:32:37,882
(They arrive at the place for the second round.)

846
00:32:37,882 --> 00:32:41,282
The mission in this round is "Sixth Sense Quiz".

847
00:32:41,782 --> 00:32:44,282
- The Running Man team goes first. - Is it...

848
00:32:44,382 --> 00:32:46,082
(I have a bad feeling.)

849
00:32:46,182 --> 00:32:49,252
- I think it is... - No way.

850
00:32:49,352 --> 00:32:54,082
Each member will take charge of each sense.

851
00:32:54,282 --> 00:32:56,252
And one member should make a guess...

852
00:32:56,452 --> 00:32:59,082
based on the information from the other members.

853
00:32:59,452 --> 00:33:01,252
Each team will answer two questions at once.

854
00:33:01,352 --> 00:33:05,012
If you end in a tie, the team that took less time to answer will win.

855
00:33:05,782 --> 00:33:07,452
- This is... - No way.

856
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:09,152
(We've done this before, right?)

857
00:33:09,252 --> 00:33:10,512
(My premonition was never wrong.)

858
00:33:10,512 --> 00:33:12,182
I was hoping we wouldn't do this.

859
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:13,512
(My premonition was never wrong.)

860
00:33:14,912 --> 00:33:16,612
(They've done this scary mission seven months ago.)

861
00:33:16,612 --> 00:33:19,082
What is this? It feels so strange!

862
00:33:19,382 --> 00:33:20,512
(It's scarier because they can't see it.)

863
00:33:20,512 --> 00:33:21,982
What is this?

864
00:33:21,982 --> 00:33:24,152
(It's scarier because they can't see it.)

865
00:33:24,152 --> 00:33:25,882
Get out, Ji Hyo.

866
00:33:28,152 --> 00:33:30,882
- You can't decide that. - I'll smell.

867
00:33:31,252 --> 00:33:34,052
The other members aren't allowed to answer on behalf of anyone.

868
00:33:34,152 --> 00:33:36,082
The team members can only describe what they felt.

869
00:33:36,182 --> 00:33:37,952
- Jong Kook should touch it. - You're right.

870
00:33:37,952 --> 00:33:39,282
Jong Kook, you can touch it.

871
00:33:39,682 --> 00:33:42,312
- You can't decide that. - Who will smell, then?

872
00:33:42,512 --> 00:33:44,082
- I want to smell it. - He's sensitive.

873
00:33:44,252 --> 00:33:47,382
Team Running Man, please discuss it over there.

874
00:33:47,512 --> 00:33:49,682
- Team Avengers, please sit down. - Why should I do that?

875
00:33:49,682 --> 00:33:52,282
- Please sit down and... - Who will see it?

876
00:33:52,282 --> 00:33:54,452
(What items will they be guessing today?)

877
00:33:56,552 --> 00:33:57,982
(Please wait and see.)

878
00:33:57,982 --> 00:33:59,852
I am sure you prepared scarier objects.

879
00:34:00,082 --> 00:34:03,682
If the object hurts me, I'm going to kill it.

880
00:34:04,252 --> 00:34:06,652
Please do not kill it.

881
00:34:06,782 --> 00:34:08,282
I made it clear now.

882
00:34:08,282 --> 00:34:09,922
- Please don't kill it. - My goodness.

883
00:34:10,052 --> 00:34:11,482
I really mean it. I'll kill it.

884
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:13,952
Here's the first item!

885
00:34:14,182 --> 00:34:16,682
- Okay. - In 1, 2, 3!

886
00:34:16,782 --> 00:34:20,082
(What is the first item that will stimulate the members' senses?)

887
00:34:23,182 --> 00:34:24,552
- Gosh. - What is it?

888
00:34:24,552 --> 00:34:26,882
- This is unbelievable! - My goodness!

889
00:34:27,682 --> 00:34:30,482
(They're seriously shocked.)

890
00:34:30,782 --> 00:34:32,212
This is really something!

891
00:34:32,512 --> 00:34:33,782
- Will they really be all right? - That's too much.

892
00:34:33,882 --> 00:34:35,482
(Will they really be all right?)

893
00:34:35,582 --> 00:34:38,352
(Are they acting, or are they really shocked?)

894
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:40,612
(They're about to lose their minds.)

895
00:34:40,982 --> 00:34:42,812
(Ji Hyo has to guess the answer.)

896
00:34:42,922 --> 00:34:44,782
- My goodness. - I can't believe this.

897
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:47,352
- This is truly shocking. - Kwang Soo.

898
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:48,712
(It's giving them goose bumps.)

899
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:49,922
I'm going to hear this.

900
00:34:50,052 --> 00:34:51,922
- I want to smell it. - Gosh, I'm scared.

901
00:34:52,152 --> 00:34:55,112
- My goodness. - Look at Dong Hyun. It's real!

902
00:34:55,652 --> 00:34:56,952
Gosh, this is so scary.

903
00:34:57,112 --> 00:34:58,582
- Let's do it. - Go for it.

904
00:34:58,682 --> 00:35:00,782
- I don't think I can touch this. - Go on.

905
00:35:01,152 --> 00:35:03,182
They're just trying to scare us.

906
00:35:03,282 --> 00:35:04,582
- It won't kill us, will it? - Gosh, this is crazy.

907
00:35:04,682 --> 00:35:06,652
My goodness, just do it already.

908
00:35:07,922 --> 00:35:09,582
Why don't you try it yourself?

909
00:35:10,252 --> 00:35:12,212
- This is really scary. - They're so scared.

910
00:35:12,252 --> 00:35:14,112
- I'm serious. - Do it! No, don't!

911
00:35:14,652 --> 00:35:15,982
(Why are you doing this to me?)

912
00:35:15,982 --> 00:35:17,182
Please don't do that!

913
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:21,052
- My goodness. - I've never seen that before.

914
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:22,782
(What is inside the box?)

915
00:35:22,782 --> 00:35:25,282
- I can't do this. - Gosh.

916
00:35:25,282 --> 00:35:26,882
(What is inside the box?)

917
00:35:27,422 --> 00:35:29,482
- Is it moving? - It is moving.

918
00:35:29,682 --> 00:35:31,282
- This is my first time seeing that. - Gosh.

919
00:35:31,882 --> 00:35:33,782
(Is it a hand?)

920
00:35:34,182 --> 00:35:36,212
- I have to feel it. - Go down.

921
00:35:36,212 --> 00:35:37,652
(They're acting to scare Team Running Man.)

922
00:35:37,712 --> 00:35:38,812
What is it?

923
00:35:38,812 --> 00:35:40,552
(He is really scared.)

924
00:35:41,112 --> 00:35:42,422
(Gary's hand is close to the hand in the box.)

925
00:35:43,512 --> 00:35:44,922
- No, not there! - It's moving.

926
00:35:44,982 --> 00:35:47,052
- I can't do this. - Not there.

927
00:35:47,782 --> 00:35:48,922
(Cringing)

928
00:35:48,922 --> 00:35:50,552
You look so ugly. Just do it.

929
00:35:50,652 --> 00:35:52,082
Be quiet. That's not important.

930
00:35:52,752 --> 00:35:53,982
(Screaming)

931
00:35:54,182 --> 00:35:56,752
(He touched the hand inside the box.)

932
00:35:57,882 --> 00:35:58,922
(Gary finally lost his mind.)

933
00:35:59,012 --> 00:36:00,282
Why? What was it?

934
00:36:00,382 --> 00:36:02,552
It almost bit you. That was so close!

935
00:36:02,652 --> 00:36:04,612
- You almost got bitten. - Goodness.

936
00:36:04,612 --> 00:36:05,882
(He's dizzy.)

937
00:36:07,052 --> 00:36:09,182
- It touched me. - What did you touch?

938
00:36:09,382 --> 00:36:10,652
- Is it moving? - My gosh.

939
00:36:10,782 --> 00:36:12,782
- Is it alive? - It licked me.

940
00:36:13,152 --> 00:36:15,982
(I think it licked my hand.)

941
00:36:17,252 --> 00:36:20,652
(The hand touched Gary just like a reptile's tongue.)

942
00:36:22,452 --> 00:36:25,812
- This is really something. - Are you serious?

943
00:36:25,882 --> 00:36:28,012
- Describe it. - Tell me what you felt.

944
00:36:28,182 --> 00:36:29,512
- What did it feel like? - Tell us.

945
00:36:29,782 --> 00:36:30,882
- Tell us. - Come on.

946
00:36:30,982 --> 00:36:32,152
I felt its skin.

947
00:36:32,282 --> 00:36:35,512
- What? - It was skin.

948
00:36:35,552 --> 00:36:38,652
- My gosh, this is scary. - I'm not sure if it was a tongue...

949
00:36:38,652 --> 00:36:39,852
- or skin. - Really?

950
00:36:40,052 --> 00:36:41,882
- Gosh! - I don't think I can do this.

951
00:36:42,052 --> 00:36:43,152
Let's switch our positions.

952
00:36:43,152 --> 00:36:45,612
- I'm not exaggerating! - You should do it.

953
00:36:45,712 --> 00:36:47,952
- You know I can't do this. - My goodness!

954
00:36:48,052 --> 00:36:50,712
- Will you not start? - You know I can't do this.

955
00:36:51,482 --> 00:36:52,982
- What are you doing? - I can't do this.

956
00:36:53,082 --> 00:36:54,652
- Just do it! - I'm too scared now.

957
00:36:55,782 --> 00:36:59,452
(It's Kwang Soo's turn to hear it now.)

958
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:00,922
Is this sound really coming from the box?

959
00:37:02,612 --> 00:37:03,652
(Kwang Soo, come on.)

960
00:37:03,652 --> 00:37:05,282
He looks like a fool again.

961
00:37:05,282 --> 00:37:06,282
(I can hear you.)

962
00:37:06,482 --> 00:37:08,682
- Kwang Soo, what do you hear? - It was dry.

963
00:37:08,782 --> 00:37:09,982
What does it sound like?

964
00:37:10,422 --> 00:37:11,952
I'm telling you, it moves.

965
00:37:12,552 --> 00:37:14,382
- Gosh, you're lying. - I am not.

966
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,382
(What did Kwang Soo hear?)

967
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:20,382
(The noise is 100 percent made only by hand.)

968
00:37:21,252 --> 00:37:23,152
The thing moves. It moves.

969
00:37:23,422 --> 00:37:25,382
- It moves? - I fought with it.

970
00:37:26,282 --> 00:37:27,352
(It sounds like this.)

971
00:37:27,352 --> 00:37:28,682
This is how it sounds like.

972
00:37:29,182 --> 00:37:30,482
- Then... - Is it a dinosaur?

973
00:37:30,482 --> 00:37:31,482
Is it a tongue?

974
00:37:31,512 --> 00:37:32,982
- Gosh, I can't do this. - I think it's a tongue.

975
00:37:32,982 --> 00:37:34,782
Toads are poisonous.

976
00:37:35,782 --> 00:37:37,282
It's warm.

977
00:37:37,282 --> 00:37:38,652
Right. It's really something.

978
00:37:38,652 --> 00:37:39,922
Why is it warm?

979
00:37:40,582 --> 00:37:42,612
- It's really warm inside. - Just do it.

980
00:37:42,712 --> 00:37:44,252
- Why is it warm? - Feel the skin.

981
00:37:44,352 --> 00:37:46,382
- My goodness. - Just do it.

982
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:48,422
I almost hit you with my elbow.

983
00:37:49,012 --> 00:37:50,452
- My goodness. - We have no time to waste.

984
00:37:51,082 --> 00:37:52,812
(He's hesitating.)

985
00:37:54,352 --> 00:37:55,922
Do it slowly.

986
00:37:57,512 --> 00:37:58,552
(He screams.)

987
00:37:59,612 --> 00:38:01,612
(Jae Seok slightly touches the hand.)

988
00:38:03,582 --> 00:38:06,052
- You! - What's wrong with you?

989
00:38:06,182 --> 00:38:09,052
- It's alive. - I told you! It's moving!

990
00:38:09,282 --> 00:38:11,282
- Is it really moving? - Gosh.

991
00:38:11,582 --> 00:38:13,482
I told you that it moves.

992
00:38:13,682 --> 00:38:15,052
Jae Seok just swore.

993
00:38:15,582 --> 00:38:17,422
- Is it alive? - It is.

994
00:38:17,512 --> 00:38:19,082
- Really? - It's moving.

995
00:38:19,082 --> 00:38:21,652
Why are you doing this to me? No, I don't want to do it.

996
00:38:22,552 --> 00:38:23,652
- This is... - Is it really alive?

997
00:38:23,652 --> 00:38:25,582
- It's so scary. - Hold on.

998
00:38:25,612 --> 00:38:26,852
(Haha smells it.)

999
00:38:28,152 --> 00:38:31,182
Wait. It smells like my grandmother.

1000
00:38:32,422 --> 00:38:34,182
- What? - I'm serious.

1001
00:38:34,182 --> 00:38:35,282
(It smells like Haha's grandmother.)

1002
00:38:35,282 --> 00:38:36,482
- What does it smell like? - Please tell us.

1003
00:38:36,482 --> 00:38:39,682
It smells like a house where five guys live in.

1004
00:38:40,182 --> 00:38:42,512
You must touch it to guess the item.

1005
00:38:42,752 --> 00:38:45,112
- I am pretty sure. - Still, I have no idea!

1006
00:38:45,352 --> 00:38:47,982
It's like a room where five guys live in.

1007
00:38:48,582 --> 00:38:50,082
- Gosh, what on earth is it? - I'm so curious.

1008
00:38:50,082 --> 00:38:52,452
- What is it? - It really smells like guys.

1009
00:38:52,452 --> 00:38:53,782
- What colour is it? - It moved really quickly.

1010
00:38:53,882 --> 00:38:55,482
- What is it? - It's soundless.

1011
00:38:55,582 --> 00:38:57,312
- It doesn't have any hair. - But it moves very fast.

1012
00:38:57,882 --> 00:38:59,152
It's really hard to guess.

1013
00:38:59,382 --> 00:39:01,282
- If it's quiet... - Do people live inside the box?

1014
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,682
If it is soundless...

1015
00:39:02,782 --> 00:39:03,882
(That's not entirely wrong though.)

1016
00:39:04,082 --> 00:39:06,212
- It is a soundless... - Take a look at it.

1017
00:39:06,682 --> 00:39:07,882
What colour is it?

1018
00:39:07,952 --> 00:39:10,382
It was moving before, but it stopped moving.

1019
00:39:10,552 --> 00:39:12,812
- You said it's alive. - It's dead now.

1020
00:39:12,922 --> 00:39:15,012
It's sinking down inside the box.

1021
00:39:15,452 --> 00:39:16,812
I don't think it's a living creature.

1022
00:39:17,082 --> 00:39:20,012
- What? - It's not alive. I think...

1023
00:39:20,152 --> 00:39:21,682
it's something made of steel.

1024
00:39:21,682 --> 00:39:23,252
- It is... - Made of steel?

1025
00:39:23,452 --> 00:39:24,782
Then...

1026
00:39:25,052 --> 00:39:26,652
It smells like...

1027
00:39:27,482 --> 00:39:29,782
- It's really hot in here. - It is.

1028
00:39:29,882 --> 00:39:31,182
Is it because it's breathing?

1029
00:39:31,382 --> 00:39:33,612
It's steaming inside.

1030
00:39:33,982 --> 00:39:35,082
(He moves his hand around.)

1031
00:39:37,352 --> 00:39:38,352
(They almost shake hands.)

1032
00:39:38,352 --> 00:39:39,882
Why?

1033
00:39:40,382 --> 00:39:42,182
It's a bit wet.

1034
00:39:42,382 --> 00:39:44,712
- Is it wet? - Yes, it's wet.

1035
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:46,512
- I think... - It's wet.

1036
00:39:46,612 --> 00:39:48,712
- Why is it wet? - It's wet.

1037
00:39:49,252 --> 00:39:50,552
I've seen it a lot before.

1038
00:39:50,712 --> 00:39:52,652
It's really dangerous.

1039
00:39:54,052 --> 00:39:55,422
(Seok Jin gets shocked.)

1040
00:39:55,552 --> 00:39:58,422
- What was that? - I think it's an abalone.

1041
00:39:58,882 --> 00:40:00,712
- What? - An abalone.

1042
00:40:00,882 --> 00:40:03,182
It was wet, and it felt like skin.

1043
00:40:03,182 --> 00:40:05,182
- Is it slippery? - Mine was dry.

1044
00:40:05,182 --> 00:40:08,382
- Mine was dry. - But mine was wet.

1045
00:40:08,712 --> 00:40:10,482
- It moved very fast. - You didn't touch it.

1046
00:40:10,582 --> 00:40:11,982
I did touch it.

1047
00:40:12,182 --> 00:40:13,712
- You didn't. - I brushed up against it.

1048
00:40:13,922 --> 00:40:16,682
- Really? - Ji Hyo, it's like skin.

1049
00:40:16,682 --> 00:40:18,452
- Try putting everything together. - Can it be a sponge?

1050
00:40:18,552 --> 00:40:20,152
It made slurping sounds.

1051
00:40:20,452 --> 00:40:22,152
You said it was slippery.

1052
00:40:22,152 --> 00:40:23,782
It sounded more like this.

1053
00:40:23,882 --> 00:40:25,812
It moved quickly and touched my hand.

1054
00:40:26,082 --> 00:40:27,182
Did it really sound like that?

1055
00:40:27,282 --> 00:40:30,982
(Will they be able to guess it correctly?)

1056
00:40:33,422 --> 00:40:34,482
Is it a bullfrog?

1057
00:40:34,582 --> 00:40:36,882
(Her guess is a bullfrog.)

1058
00:40:37,282 --> 00:40:38,312
You're wrong.

1059
00:40:38,422 --> 00:40:40,152
- It's hard. - You were close.

1060
00:40:40,882 --> 00:40:43,422
- My goodness! - Isn't that a hand?

1061
00:40:43,422 --> 00:40:44,752
(Surprise!)

1062
00:40:45,352 --> 00:40:47,582
- It's a human hand. - There's a hand inside the box.

1063
00:40:47,682 --> 00:40:49,882
- Is it a hand? - This is what I touched.

1064
00:40:49,882 --> 00:40:51,552
- Gosh. - Is it a hand?

1065
00:40:51,652 --> 00:40:53,952
- How did it make such a sound? - Whose smell was it?

1066
00:40:54,052 --> 00:40:57,152
- I told you. - You thought it was calamari.

1067
00:40:57,252 --> 00:40:58,812
- Haha. - It stinks.

1068
00:40:58,812 --> 00:41:00,452
You were right, then.

1069
00:41:00,452 --> 00:41:02,152
- It is... - It smells like factory bread.

1070
00:41:02,452 --> 00:41:04,282
It's Team Avengers' turn now.

1071
00:41:04,482 --> 00:41:06,422
They don't seem that scared.

1072
00:41:06,782 --> 00:41:09,282
Let's open the first item right away.

1073
00:41:09,782 --> 00:41:10,922
Am I in charge of looking at it?

1074
00:41:12,352 --> 00:41:14,082
You should touch it.

1075
00:41:14,952 --> 00:41:16,812
- I'll listen to it. - No way.

1076
00:41:16,922 --> 00:41:17,922
In one,

1077
00:41:17,922 --> 00:41:19,452
- I can hear very well. - two,

1078
00:41:19,482 --> 00:41:21,112
- What? Who? - three.

1079
00:41:21,112 --> 00:41:23,052
(You were so relaxed when you were watching it, right?)

1080
00:41:24,112 --> 00:41:27,312
(What will be in the boxes this time?)

1081
00:41:28,782 --> 00:41:30,212
This is so different from ours.

1082
00:41:30,882 --> 00:41:32,112
(What could it be?)

1083
00:41:32,112 --> 00:41:33,482
This is so different from ours.

1084
00:41:34,652 --> 00:41:36,382
- What is that? - Oh, my.

1085
00:41:36,422 --> 00:41:38,252
- They can't see. - This is not a joke.

1086
00:41:38,552 --> 00:41:40,922
- This is too much. - This is so different from ours.

1087
00:41:41,252 --> 00:41:43,652
So this is what you got for them. Good job.

1088
00:41:43,982 --> 00:41:45,182
Well done.

1089
00:41:45,182 --> 00:41:47,982
- You didn't betray us. - This is crazy.

1090
00:41:47,982 --> 00:41:50,812
- This is too much. - I'm not kidding.

1091
00:41:50,852 --> 00:41:52,282
- We're not lying. - What is it?

1092
00:41:52,312 --> 00:41:54,312
- I'm telling you for real. - This is real.

1093
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:56,482
- We're not joking. - It really moved.

1094
00:41:56,482 --> 00:41:58,682
- This one looks angry. - Look at this. Look.

1095
00:41:58,682 --> 00:41:59,952
I swear that it is alive.

1096
00:41:59,952 --> 00:42:01,582
- It really is. - This is surprising.

1097
00:42:01,582 --> 00:42:03,212
- Look at this. - This is insane.

1098
00:42:03,212 --> 00:42:04,422
Take a look at this!

1099
00:42:04,422 --> 00:42:06,012
- Look at this one. - It is so active.

1100
00:42:06,012 --> 00:42:07,512
Look how active it is now.

1101
00:42:07,512 --> 00:42:09,852
(Are they faking it, or is it real?)

1102
00:42:09,852 --> 00:42:11,012
- But... - Wait.

1103
00:42:11,012 --> 00:42:13,282
I can hear some loud thumping noise.

1104
00:42:13,652 --> 00:42:15,882
(The loud sound is coming out through the headphones already.)

1105
00:42:16,282 --> 00:42:18,282
- Put in your hand first. - It's the first time I see it.

1106
00:42:19,082 --> 00:42:21,182
- Just put it in. - It's not very dangerous but...

1107
00:42:21,252 --> 00:42:22,512
- No. - It can be dangerous.

1108
00:42:22,512 --> 00:42:24,582
To my knowledge, it has teeth for sure.

1109
00:42:24,582 --> 00:42:26,812
- I can feel the movement. - It's moving.

1110
00:42:26,812 --> 00:42:29,082
- You're right. - It's really alive.

1111
00:42:29,082 --> 00:42:32,812
- I've never touched one alive. - Me neither.

1112
00:42:32,952 --> 00:42:34,422
- I mean it. - It's true.

1113
00:42:34,422 --> 00:42:37,652
- Try to touch it. - You don't usually touch it alive.

1114
00:42:37,952 --> 00:42:40,782
- Even if I knew what it is, I... - I would not be able to touch it.

1115
00:42:40,782 --> 00:42:42,282
(Are they telling the truth or not?)

1116
00:42:42,282 --> 00:42:45,252
(What is the item that will stimulate their senses?)

1117
00:42:46,422 --> 00:42:48,552
Hyung Bin, what's wrong with your hand?

1118
00:42:48,552 --> 00:42:50,382
(Welcome. Please explore me.)

1119
00:42:52,312 --> 00:42:54,552
Hyung Bin, what's wrong with your hand?

1120
00:42:54,552 --> 00:42:56,012
Touch it right.

1121
00:42:56,882 --> 00:42:58,312
(I can't get my wrist straight.)

1122
00:42:58,312 --> 00:43:00,312
- You're almost there. - Almost.

1123
00:43:00,312 --> 00:43:02,422
- Is there a plate? - A little further.

1124
00:43:02,422 --> 00:43:05,182
It's already standing so just spread your fingers.

1125
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:07,782
I've never seen anyone touching it alive.

1126
00:43:07,782 --> 00:43:08,882
No way.

1127
00:43:08,882 --> 00:43:10,982
- Does it have feet? - I can only touch it if it's dead.

1128
00:43:11,152 --> 00:43:13,082
- Only if it's dead. - Of course.

1129
00:43:13,082 --> 00:43:14,152
(He is just 1cm above the abalone.)

1130
00:43:14,422 --> 00:43:15,982
I'm scared to see their faces.

1131
00:43:16,612 --> 00:43:17,752
Oh, I couldn't...

1132
00:43:19,882 --> 00:43:21,012
(Screaming)

1133
00:43:21,582 --> 00:43:22,812
(He wants to fight with the abalone.)

1134
00:43:22,812 --> 00:43:23,882
Hey.

1135
00:43:24,552 --> 00:43:25,652
I hate it.

1136
00:43:25,852 --> 00:43:28,882
- I can't touch it even if I see it. - I felt something mushy.

1137
00:43:28,882 --> 00:43:30,752
- Mushy? - There's something mushy.

1138
00:43:30,752 --> 00:43:34,282
It's not too mushy, but it is a little bit.

1139
00:43:34,282 --> 00:43:36,082
- Did it bite? - It felt like a monster.

1140
00:43:36,152 --> 00:43:37,612
- Is it alive? - I think so.

1141
00:43:37,612 --> 00:43:39,452
- Is it wet? - Then what's this sound?

1142
00:43:39,512 --> 00:43:40,682
What is this?

1143
00:43:40,982 --> 00:43:42,812
I don't know why they put listening to this.

1144
00:43:42,812 --> 00:43:45,212
- I've never heard the sound of it. - I hear a fizzing sound.

1145
00:43:45,212 --> 00:43:46,882
Could you mimic the sound?

1146
00:43:47,582 --> 00:43:49,452
It's the sound of chewing something.

1147
00:43:49,452 --> 00:43:50,652
Try to make that sound.

1148
00:43:50,652 --> 00:43:52,512
- I can hear it, too. - Make the sound.

1149
00:43:52,512 --> 00:43:54,282
- Sung Hoon. - That's because it has teeth.

1150
00:43:54,282 --> 00:43:56,282
- Mimic the sound. - It sounds like it's munching.

1151
00:43:56,282 --> 00:43:58,682
- Did they feed it? - What on earth is it?

1152
00:44:00,352 --> 00:44:04,082
(It's the sound you can hear when you take abalones off.)

1153
00:44:05,482 --> 00:44:07,812
(Respond, my hearing organs.)

1154
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:10,212
There is a fizzing sound...

1155
00:44:10,252 --> 00:44:11,712
and it's chewing on something.

1156
00:44:11,712 --> 00:44:12,982
- What is it chewing? - That's right.

1157
00:44:12,982 --> 00:44:14,582
- What's the fizzing sound? - It has to eat something.

1158
00:44:14,882 --> 00:44:16,812
- It has teeth anyway. - It's slippery...

1159
00:44:16,812 --> 00:44:18,352
and mushy.

1160
00:44:18,352 --> 00:44:19,782
- Is it slippery? - Yes.

1161
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,712
- It has teeth. - Next, it's Key's turn.

1162
00:44:21,712 --> 00:44:23,512
(Key tries to guess by looking at it.)

1163
00:44:23,512 --> 00:44:24,612
Can you see it?

1164
00:44:25,612 --> 00:44:27,912
It's not moving, but what colour is this?

1165
00:44:27,912 --> 00:44:29,082
It is moving now.

1166
00:44:29,152 --> 00:44:30,312
Is it moving?

1167
00:44:31,452 --> 00:44:32,552
Let me see.

1168
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,312
- Are you done? - It's light green.

1169
00:44:35,482 --> 00:44:36,812
- Light green? - Great.

1170
00:44:36,812 --> 00:44:38,612
- It must be a reptile. - He's good.

1171
00:44:38,712 --> 00:44:40,482
How did you notice that?

1172
00:44:41,212 --> 00:44:42,852
Next, it's Gyeong Gyu.

1173
00:44:43,252 --> 00:44:44,712
- Is it a snake? - In fact,

1174
00:44:44,752 --> 00:44:46,712
- I'm not afraid of anything. - No way.

1175
00:44:46,752 --> 00:44:47,752
I mean it. What should I do?

1176
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:49,652
(You have the most active one.)

1177
00:44:49,752 --> 00:44:51,152
You have the most active one.

1178
00:44:51,412 --> 00:44:53,052
(Suddenly, he's flustered.)

1179
00:44:53,052 --> 00:44:54,212
It is very energetic.

1180
00:44:54,212 --> 00:44:55,752
It's the only one that is still standing.

1181
00:44:55,752 --> 00:44:57,682
- Really. - Yes, it's still standing.

1182
00:44:57,682 --> 00:44:58,852
It's the only one standing.

1183
00:44:58,852 --> 00:45:01,182
It is as if an alligator is opening its mouth like this.

1184
00:45:01,452 --> 00:45:02,912
- It really is. - Right.

1185
00:45:02,912 --> 00:45:05,112
Yours is incredibly active.

1186
00:45:05,152 --> 00:45:06,852
- He looks scared. - It's still standing.

1187
00:45:06,852 --> 00:45:09,112
- You should know that. - It is true.

1188
00:45:09,712 --> 00:45:11,952
(Decide which hand is more important to you.)

1189
00:45:12,652 --> 00:45:15,382
Decide which hand is more important.

1190
00:45:15,682 --> 00:45:16,782
(He changes to his left hand.)

1191
00:45:16,782 --> 00:45:18,012
Which hand do you use to hold your microphone?

1192
00:45:18,012 --> 00:45:20,152
Put in the hand that is less important.

1193
00:45:20,412 --> 00:45:22,452
- He put in the left hand. - Yes.

1194
00:45:22,452 --> 00:45:23,982
He must be right-handed.

1195
00:45:24,412 --> 00:45:26,412
- It's moving. - It's not there.

1196
00:45:26,412 --> 00:45:28,482
It's not over there but in the centre.

1197
00:45:28,812 --> 00:45:30,252
- It's in the centre. - Centre.

1198
00:45:30,252 --> 00:45:32,112
Don't pretend you are touching it.

1199
00:45:32,212 --> 00:45:35,482
- He's pretending. - You said you're not afraid.

1200
00:45:35,682 --> 00:45:37,012
This one is really moving a lot.

1201
00:45:37,382 --> 00:45:39,782
- He's almost there. - Almost there.

1202
00:45:40,312 --> 00:45:41,412
Just a little further.

1203
00:45:41,682 --> 00:45:42,712
(Screaming)

1204
00:45:46,712 --> 00:45:48,982
(That was such a frightening touch.)

1205
00:45:48,982 --> 00:45:50,652
- It's moving. - It keeps moving.

1206
00:45:50,682 --> 00:45:52,752
- It touched my hand suddenly. - It moves a lot.

1207
00:45:53,752 --> 00:45:54,912
It was going to bite me.

1208
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:56,582
- He's startled. - He's flustered.

1209
00:45:57,052 --> 00:45:58,812
You touched it with just the tip of your finger.

1210
00:45:58,852 --> 00:46:00,612
You're easily scared.

1211
00:46:01,182 --> 00:46:03,312
- You're timid. - You are a coward.

1212
00:46:03,312 --> 00:46:05,552
- He easily gets scared. - Gosh.

1213
00:46:05,682 --> 00:46:07,452
I still respect you.

1214
00:46:07,752 --> 00:46:09,552
I felt it just with the tip of the finger.

1215
00:46:09,552 --> 00:46:10,652
Is it alive?

1216
00:46:10,882 --> 00:46:12,712
He is a respectable senior...

1217
00:46:12,712 --> 00:46:14,212
- It is slightly mushy. - yet he is timid.

1218
00:46:14,212 --> 00:46:15,482
Next, let's go, Hee Jun.

1219
00:46:16,152 --> 00:46:17,582
Does it smell?

1220
00:46:18,082 --> 00:46:20,682
(Let's try to smell it.)

1221
00:46:20,682 --> 00:46:22,182
- Can you smell it? - Does it smell?

1222
00:46:22,282 --> 00:46:23,952
Smelling is important.

1223
00:46:24,412 --> 00:46:25,612
(Who are you?)

1224
00:46:26,512 --> 00:46:28,752
- It smells like a new house. - A new house?

1225
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:30,182
- Yes, a new house. - A new house?

1226
00:46:30,182 --> 00:46:31,752
Maybe with four bedrooms?

1227
00:46:32,352 --> 00:46:34,312
It smells like the wall of a living room.

1228
00:46:34,312 --> 00:46:36,382
He has a keen sense.

1229
00:46:37,282 --> 00:46:39,112
There is a P apartment in there.

1230
00:46:41,682 --> 00:46:42,882
I think it's R apartment.

1231
00:46:43,512 --> 00:46:44,752
(Why not E apartment?)

1232
00:46:44,752 --> 00:46:46,452
- Stop joking and smell it. - Okay.

1233
00:46:47,752 --> 00:46:49,882
- It smells... - I think it doesn't have a head.

1234
00:46:50,812 --> 00:46:52,552
like an apartment in Busan.

1235
00:46:53,782 --> 00:46:56,212
It smells slightly fishy,

1236
00:46:56,212 --> 00:46:58,182
so it's like an apartment near the beach.

1237
00:46:58,182 --> 00:46:59,352
He is so sharp.

1238
00:46:59,452 --> 00:47:01,152
- Next, it's Dong Hyun. - Go ahead.

1239
00:47:01,182 --> 00:47:02,782
- He is so brave. - Let's see.

1240
00:47:02,782 --> 00:47:05,182
- Dong Hyun is so manly. - Dong Hyun's is so scary.

1241
00:47:05,652 --> 00:47:08,052
(Let's see if you are a real man.)

1242
00:47:08,352 --> 00:47:10,282
- That one is active, too. - It's the most active.

1243
00:47:10,282 --> 00:47:11,882
I've never seen it like that.

1244
00:47:12,882 --> 00:47:15,752
(He flies like a butterfly and dominates the ring.)

1245
00:47:15,752 --> 00:47:17,852
(He's like a stun gun that terrifies the opponents.)

1246
00:47:17,852 --> 00:47:19,952
(He is the professional fighter, Kim Dong Hyun.)

1247
00:47:20,752 --> 00:47:23,812
(Dominate the abalone for the honour of a fighter.)

1248
00:47:23,812 --> 00:47:26,112
- I don't think he'll get hurt. - Oh, goodness.

1249
00:47:28,852 --> 00:47:29,952
(Now, it's time to respond.)

1250
00:47:30,552 --> 00:47:32,282
(He's twitching.)

1251
00:47:34,552 --> 00:47:36,212
- He twitched. - It's moving.

1252
00:47:37,482 --> 00:47:39,652
(A guy whose nickname is a stun gun seems to be attacked by one.)

1253
00:47:39,652 --> 00:47:42,852
(They immerse themselves in acting and make a fuss.)

1254
00:47:43,482 --> 00:47:44,482
It's moving!

1255
00:47:44,512 --> 00:47:46,412
- It's standing. - Please stop.

1256
00:47:46,412 --> 00:47:48,382
- Really? - Please stop it.

1257
00:47:51,282 --> 00:47:52,482
(Goodness!)

1258
00:47:52,482 --> 00:47:54,852
Some parts are hard,

1259
00:47:54,852 --> 00:47:56,382
- but other parts are soft. - Really?

1260
00:47:56,382 --> 00:47:57,652
And is it alive?

1261
00:47:57,812 --> 00:47:59,282
I think this one is dead.

1262
00:47:59,282 --> 00:48:00,982
- It's alive. - It is.

1263
00:48:01,552 --> 00:48:04,682
(Now, try to guess what is in the box.)

1264
00:48:04,682 --> 00:48:06,412
(What is Hye Jin's conclusion?)

1265
00:48:06,412 --> 00:48:08,382
- It is both hard and soft. - It's a turtle.

1266
00:48:08,382 --> 00:48:10,112
(The answer of Team Avengers is a turtle.)

1267
00:48:10,112 --> 00:48:11,682
- A turtle? - Is it a turtle?

1268
00:48:11,682 --> 00:48:13,452
- A turtle? - I don't think it's a turtle.

1269
00:48:14,852 --> 00:48:16,552
It doesn't smell like a turtle.

1270
00:48:16,552 --> 00:48:18,552
- The correct answer is abalone. - So it was them.

1271
00:48:18,552 --> 00:48:21,052
- They are so active. - Oh, gosh.

1272
00:48:21,682 --> 00:48:23,612
Smelling like an apartment in Busan was correct.

1273
00:48:24,082 --> 00:48:25,912
- They are alive. - And they are active.

1274
00:48:25,912 --> 00:48:27,952
(The current score is zero to zero.)

1275
00:48:27,952 --> 00:48:29,952
They are really alive.

1276
00:48:31,312 --> 00:48:33,152
- I'd like to look at it. - I can do that.

1277
00:48:33,152 --> 00:48:34,252
We need two people to touch it.

1278
00:48:34,252 --> 00:48:36,112
- You try to touch it. - I can't even look at it.

1279
00:48:36,112 --> 00:48:37,582
That place if for touching and this is for looking.

1280
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:40,912
- I want to look at it. - We'll reveal the third item.

1281
00:48:40,952 --> 00:48:42,752
- I can't do this. - In one,

1282
00:48:42,752 --> 00:48:44,552
- They are arguing. - two,

1283
00:48:44,552 --> 00:48:45,712
- Who is touching it? - three.

1284
00:48:45,712 --> 00:48:47,112
I'm startled.

1285
00:48:47,112 --> 00:48:48,582
- You need to taste it. - What?

1286
00:48:48,582 --> 00:48:50,052
- Taste it? - Yes.

1287
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:52,212
(What could it be?)

1288
00:48:52,882 --> 00:48:55,082
(The Avengers start to overreact.)

1289
00:48:55,112 --> 00:48:57,052
- You should not taste it. - Don't touch that part.

1290
00:48:57,552 --> 00:49:00,012
You mean I should taste it? No way.

1291
00:49:00,982 --> 00:49:02,482
(Do you want to taste a piece of it?)

1292
00:49:03,152 --> 00:49:04,812
Kwang Soo, go ahead.

1293
00:49:04,952 --> 00:49:06,512
- I'm scared. - It smells awful.

1294
00:49:06,682 --> 00:49:09,082
It has a strong smell. We should figure it out.

1295
00:49:09,082 --> 00:49:10,452
I think it's a fermented skate ray.

1296
00:49:11,082 --> 00:49:12,782
- It smells like a fermented skate. - Gosh.

1297
00:49:14,112 --> 00:49:16,682
- I think it's a dried fish. - A little more backwards.

1298
00:49:17,452 --> 00:49:19,152
- Move backwards. - A little more.

1299
00:49:19,752 --> 00:49:22,082
- Be careful over there. - It's scary when you don't see it.

1300
00:49:22,512 --> 00:49:23,912
(This looks like a reaction competition.)

1301
00:49:23,912 --> 00:49:25,452
- So it's that. - That is...

1302
00:49:28,482 --> 00:49:29,812
You are able to touch it though.

1303
00:49:30,212 --> 00:49:31,712
I didn't touch it yet.

1304
00:49:32,982 --> 00:49:34,152
What do you think it is, Kwang Soo?

1305
00:49:34,152 --> 00:49:35,252
(He doesn't dare to touch it yet.)

1306
00:49:35,252 --> 00:49:37,312
- What is it, Kwang Soo? - Hold on.

1307
00:49:37,312 --> 00:49:38,912
Please explain it to me.

1308
00:49:39,052 --> 00:49:41,452
- Go on. - We don't have much time.

1309
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:44,482
We don't have much time.

1310
00:49:44,852 --> 00:49:47,282
It's hard. It's hard. It's hard.

1311
00:49:47,382 --> 00:49:48,912
- Is it hard? - It's hard. It's hard.

1312
00:49:48,912 --> 00:49:51,552
- That means it's dry. - Then it's a dried fish.

1313
00:49:51,552 --> 00:49:53,182
Then Gary, what do you see?

1314
00:49:53,182 --> 00:49:54,512
I can't see it very well.

1315
00:49:54,712 --> 00:49:57,712
It looks like a tail or something.

1316
00:49:57,712 --> 00:49:58,852
- What? - Excuse me?

1317
00:49:58,852 --> 00:50:00,912
- Does it have a tail? - It looks like a brush.

1318
00:50:01,312 --> 00:50:02,552
- A brush? - Yes.

1319
00:50:02,552 --> 00:50:04,212
- Next, Haha. - What kind of dried fish is there?

1320
00:50:04,212 --> 00:50:06,052
It looks like the tip of a brush.

1321
00:50:06,052 --> 00:50:08,182
- You'll find out if you hear it. - It must be a tail.

1322
00:50:08,182 --> 00:50:09,312
Is it a dried fish?

1323
00:50:09,782 --> 00:50:11,012
I can hear it from here.

1324
00:50:11,082 --> 00:50:12,852
- It's alive. - Excuse me?

1325
00:50:13,482 --> 00:50:14,512
What sound is it?

1326
00:50:14,652 --> 00:50:16,412
(It's a crunching sound.)

1327
00:50:16,412 --> 00:50:19,852
(It's crunching sound you make when you tear something.)

1328
00:50:21,412 --> 00:50:22,452
What sound is it?

1329
00:50:23,882 --> 00:50:25,452
Hey, I have to stick my tongue in here.

1330
00:50:28,512 --> 00:50:31,082
(What is this scary sound?)

1331
00:50:31,082 --> 00:50:32,582
He really is a musician.

1332
00:50:33,452 --> 00:50:36,052
- He is a musician. - You make that sound to your baby.

1333
00:50:36,052 --> 00:50:37,282
- I'm serious. - His baby?

1334
00:50:38,282 --> 00:50:39,512
You make that sound when you play with your baby.

1335
00:50:39,512 --> 00:50:41,652
- He's making me scared. - It's Seok Jin's turn now.

1336
00:50:41,652 --> 00:50:44,012
What kind of a game is it to stick your tongue into it?

1337
00:50:44,012 --> 00:50:46,052
- Do not put in your tongue fast. - Really?

1338
00:50:46,052 --> 00:50:47,212
Why do you say so?

1339
00:50:47,212 --> 00:50:48,382
(They are enjoying Seok Jin's anxiety.)

1340
00:50:48,382 --> 00:50:49,482
It will be okay, right?

1341
00:50:50,212 --> 00:50:51,682
Your tone is funny.

1342
00:50:51,682 --> 00:50:54,782
(I'm in charge of tasting. May I kiss you?)

1343
00:50:56,252 --> 00:51:00,082
(What can be the romantic item to arouse Seok Jin's taste buds?)

1344
00:51:04,682 --> 00:51:05,752
Try to taste it.

1345
00:51:06,712 --> 00:51:08,382
I think it doesn't have teeth.

1346
00:51:08,752 --> 00:51:09,752
What's wrong?

1347
00:51:10,782 --> 00:51:11,782
What's wrong?

1348
00:51:11,952 --> 00:51:14,152
- What's wrong? - What did it taste like?

1349
00:51:14,382 --> 00:51:15,412
Did it touch your tongue?

1350
00:51:15,482 --> 00:51:19,312
It felt like a hard piece of wood.

1351
00:51:19,312 --> 00:51:20,912
What about the taste?

1352
00:51:21,052 --> 00:51:22,312
It has no taste.

1353
00:51:22,752 --> 00:51:23,812
It has no taste?

1354
00:51:23,952 --> 00:51:26,212
- It has fishy taste, though. - Fishy taste?

1355
00:51:26,552 --> 00:51:29,712
Jong Kook, touch it and describe it to us.

1356
00:51:30,052 --> 00:51:31,812
He might hurt his hand if he grips it.

1357
00:51:32,252 --> 00:51:34,282
- Be careful. - What is it?

1358
00:51:34,552 --> 00:51:36,682
- Can you tell what it is? - What?

1359
00:51:36,712 --> 00:51:37,712
Can you tell what it is?

1360
00:51:37,752 --> 00:51:41,052
- It feels like wood, but... - Right.

1361
00:51:41,082 --> 00:51:42,752
it smells like fish.

1362
00:51:42,852 --> 00:51:44,052
And...

1363
00:51:44,512 --> 00:51:46,082
- Is it something dried? - It's something...

1364
00:51:46,152 --> 00:51:47,952
we can touch with ease.

1365
00:51:48,612 --> 00:51:49,752
All right.

1366
00:51:50,282 --> 00:51:51,782
You'll sense the strong smell.

1367
00:51:52,112 --> 00:51:53,752
It smells like fish.

1368
00:51:53,882 --> 00:51:55,012
- It's that. - It's...

1369
00:51:55,182 --> 00:51:58,182
- Did you smell it often in Pohang? - I smelled it often in Pohang.

1370
00:51:58,352 --> 00:52:00,052
- It's not something... - Stop.

1371
00:52:00,212 --> 00:52:02,252
- that's completely dried. - It wasn't that soft.

1372
00:52:02,612 --> 00:52:04,552
It doesn't smell like something that's completely dried.

1373
00:52:05,012 --> 00:52:06,812
How does something that's completely dried smell?

1374
00:52:06,852 --> 00:52:08,782
I thought it's completely dried.

1375
00:52:09,152 --> 00:52:11,082
I thought it was that and she's...

1376
00:52:11,082 --> 00:52:13,052
It smells like the salt water...

1377
00:52:13,082 --> 00:52:15,652
- rather than fish. - Let's decide that as the answer.

1378
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:19,352
(What's Jae Seok's final answer after Ji Hyo's description?)

1379
00:52:19,482 --> 00:52:25,012
(It feels hard like a piece of wood.)

1380
00:52:26,752 --> 00:52:29,052
(It has a tail that looks like a brush.)

1381
00:52:29,912 --> 00:52:34,052
(It sounds crunchy as if something is being torn.)

1382
00:52:35,112 --> 00:52:37,152
(It has no taste, but smells fishy.)

1383
00:52:37,882 --> 00:52:40,782
(It smells like Pohang and something half dried.)

1384
00:52:43,552 --> 00:52:47,282
(Team Running Man gets a hint for the final mission if it's correct.)

1385
00:52:47,712 --> 00:52:49,152
Dried pollack.

1386
00:52:49,182 --> 00:52:50,252
(Jae Seok's answer is dried pollack.)

1387
00:52:50,282 --> 00:52:52,552
- Isn't it dried herring? - That's right.

1388
00:52:53,482 --> 00:52:55,652
I got confused when you said Pohang.

1389
00:52:55,652 --> 00:52:57,352
I thought you'd say dried herring.

1390
00:52:57,482 --> 00:52:59,482
- I almost said dried herring. - You didn't, though.

1391
00:52:59,582 --> 00:53:00,912
So this is dried pollack.

1392
00:53:00,952 --> 00:53:03,652
Wow, this is the dried pollack.

1393
00:53:04,552 --> 00:53:05,852
(The strange sound Haha heard was...)

1394
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:08,112
- You make that sound when you play. - I'm being serious.

1395
00:53:08,452 --> 00:53:12,082
(that of tearing dried pollack by hand.)

1396
00:53:13,382 --> 00:53:15,512
Here's the second object.

1397
00:53:16,352 --> 00:53:18,312
In 1, 2 and 3.

1398
00:53:19,052 --> 00:53:20,482
Key is up next.

1399
00:53:20,982 --> 00:53:22,712
- What is that? - What is it?

1400
00:53:23,082 --> 00:53:24,852
- What's going on? - Here they go again.

1401
00:53:25,112 --> 00:53:26,152
What is this?

1402
00:53:26,282 --> 00:53:27,452
(Here come the people who are experts on bluffing.)

1403
00:53:27,682 --> 00:53:28,982
- Goodness. - What is it?

1404
00:53:29,182 --> 00:53:30,412
How did you even get this?

1405
00:53:31,012 --> 00:53:33,482
- How did you even find this? - Does it even exist today?

1406
00:53:34,612 --> 00:53:36,052
I can't believe they came up with this idea.

1407
00:53:37,052 --> 00:53:38,052
This is unbelievable.

1408
00:53:38,082 --> 00:53:39,912
- Wow, that's... - I would give up.

1409
00:53:40,452 --> 00:53:41,812
Let's start with Key.

1410
00:53:41,812 --> 00:53:43,552
What are the chopsticks for?

1411
00:53:44,682 --> 00:53:46,112
(Is it something we can't even touch?)

1412
00:53:46,212 --> 00:53:48,012
- Does he need them for tasting? - To taste it?

1413
00:53:48,052 --> 00:53:49,352
How can he taste it?

1414
00:53:49,382 --> 00:53:51,082
- It's impossible to taste it. - This is no joke.

1415
00:53:51,982 --> 00:53:54,312
Excuse me, but is it possible to make any sound with it?

1416
00:53:54,412 --> 00:53:55,952
How can they taste it?

1417
00:53:56,052 --> 00:53:58,312
- It's impossible to taste it. - This is no joke.

1418
00:53:58,352 --> 00:54:01,552
(The scary unknown object is pork skin.)

1419
00:54:02,952 --> 00:54:04,982
It's Key's turn.

1420
00:54:05,382 --> 00:54:07,912
- Is there a plate? - There's a plate.

1421
00:54:08,552 --> 00:54:09,752
(Startled)

1422
00:54:10,352 --> 00:54:11,482
(Haha exaggerates his reaction.)

1423
00:54:11,512 --> 00:54:12,782
He just touched it.

1424
00:54:14,152 --> 00:54:15,252
He just touched it.

1425
00:54:15,282 --> 00:54:17,512
- You just touched it. - Did I?

1426
00:54:17,512 --> 00:54:19,312
You just touched it, you fool.

1427
00:54:21,052 --> 00:54:22,852
(He taps it slightly.)

1428
00:54:23,552 --> 00:54:26,552
(They exaggerate their reaction.)

1429
00:54:26,982 --> 00:54:28,812
- What is it? - How does it feel?

1430
00:54:28,812 --> 00:54:30,482
It feels like some kind of skin.

1431
00:54:31,512 --> 00:54:33,052
- Is it alive? - It feels like skin?

1432
00:54:33,082 --> 00:54:34,212
- Skin? - Is it alive?

1433
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:36,382
(Fooling them is so fun.)

1434
00:54:38,752 --> 00:54:40,482
(Hee Jun listens to the sound.)

1435
00:54:40,482 --> 00:54:42,452
Someone is making jeon.

1436
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:44,452
- Someone is making jeon. - Really?

1437
00:54:44,752 --> 00:54:48,312
- Gosh, what is it? - What happened?

1438
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:51,882
- There's a fire. There's a fire. - What's going on?

1439
00:54:52,182 --> 00:54:54,312
Things are on fire.

1440
00:54:55,082 --> 00:54:56,852
There's a fire.

1441
00:54:56,852 --> 00:54:59,012
- There's a fire. There's a fire. - What's going on?

1442
00:54:59,152 --> 00:55:04,412
(It's the sound of pork skin sizzling on the pan.)

1443
00:55:05,282 --> 00:55:07,652
At first, it sounded like someone is making jeon.

1444
00:55:07,812 --> 00:55:09,152
(Hee Jun describes the sound sensitively.)

1445
00:55:09,252 --> 00:55:11,052
- Then the sound quietens down. - You're so good at explaining it.

1446
00:55:11,082 --> 00:55:13,882
- Your description is amazing. - I can even hear the sound now.

1447
00:55:13,882 --> 00:55:16,012
- Yes, that's what I heard. - His expression is amazing.

1448
00:55:16,052 --> 00:55:17,352
He's very good at describing it.

1449
00:55:18,152 --> 00:55:19,552
Everything got burnt.

1450
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:21,352
(It's Hye Jin's turn to touch it.)

1451
00:55:21,812 --> 00:55:23,712
- Goodness. - Please.

1452
00:55:23,712 --> 00:55:25,682
- Don't do that. - I was really surprised.

1453
00:55:25,682 --> 00:55:28,212
(Hye Jin doesn't hesitate at all.)

1454
00:55:28,312 --> 00:55:30,712
- What is it? - Let's move onto the next person.

1455
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:34,512
(Mothers are amazing as they fear nothing.)

1456
00:55:34,552 --> 00:55:36,152
Gosh, she's not scared at all.

1457
00:55:37,452 --> 00:55:39,012
(She gropes about.)

1458
00:55:39,382 --> 00:55:42,382
- Gosh, don't do that. - Don't do it.

1459
00:55:42,452 --> 00:55:45,812
(She isn't fooled by their reaction.)

1460
00:55:46,482 --> 00:55:48,052
- How can she do that? - She's not scared at all.

1461
00:55:48,082 --> 00:55:49,312
Why is she doing that?

1462
00:55:49,412 --> 00:55:51,752
- Come on. - That's not fun.

1463
00:55:51,752 --> 00:55:53,652
That's not fun.

1464
00:55:53,652 --> 00:55:55,112
(They try to distract her.)

1465
00:55:55,112 --> 00:55:56,252
That's not fun.

1466
00:55:56,552 --> 00:55:58,252
She's becoming less attractive.

1467
00:55:58,952 --> 00:56:00,352
(His comment doesn't affect her.)

1468
00:56:00,352 --> 00:56:02,582
- Isn't she too bold? - That's not attractive at all.

1469
00:56:02,682 --> 00:56:03,952
She should be scared a little.

1470
00:56:03,952 --> 00:56:05,552
- What does it feel like? - It's...

1471
00:56:06,582 --> 00:56:08,052
very thin...

1472
00:56:08,352 --> 00:56:09,982
and is oily.

1473
00:56:11,282 --> 00:56:13,612
- It must be something slippery. - Aren't you scared?

1474
00:56:14,252 --> 00:56:16,612
(It's not a big deal.)

1475
00:56:17,752 --> 00:56:19,312
That's impressive.

1476
00:56:19,612 --> 00:56:23,052
Hye Jin is incredible, indeed.

1477
00:56:23,082 --> 00:56:25,352
(It's Dong Hyun's turn.)

1478
00:56:26,212 --> 00:56:27,582
Why is she not scared of that?

1479
00:56:27,612 --> 00:56:29,652
If it were Ji Hyo, she'd be crying already.

1480
00:56:30,482 --> 00:56:32,252
It looks like a thumb.

1481
00:56:32,412 --> 00:56:33,582
That's strange.

1482
00:56:33,612 --> 00:56:35,612
- It sounds a bit cruel. - Dong Hyun.

1483
00:56:35,812 --> 00:56:37,912
Dong Hyun, you're amazing.

1484
00:56:37,952 --> 00:56:38,952
(They're impressed by his sight.)

1485
00:56:39,052 --> 00:56:40,782
- He never disappoints us. - It's like...

1486
00:56:40,812 --> 00:56:42,352
- they put a thumb in here. - Are you talking about this?

1487
00:56:42,352 --> 00:56:45,012
- You're very impressive. - It looks like a thumb.

1488
00:56:45,082 --> 00:56:47,252
Does it look like this?

1489
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:49,052
It does look like a thumb.

1490
00:56:49,412 --> 00:56:51,252
I've never smelled it before.

1491
00:56:51,252 --> 00:56:53,612
- I don't know what it smells like. - I wonder what it smells like.

1492
00:56:53,852 --> 00:56:55,912
It smells like my grandmother's pillow.

1493
00:56:56,082 --> 00:56:58,652
(It means his grandmother used pork skin as her pillow all her life.)

1494
00:56:58,782 --> 00:57:01,712
It's so familiar like my grandmother's pillow.

1495
00:57:02,182 --> 00:57:04,982
- I don't know why, but it does. - Really?

1496
00:57:07,352 --> 00:57:09,982
It's not an odour that gives you a bad feeling.

1497
00:57:10,152 --> 00:57:11,582
It's somewhat savoury.

1498
00:57:11,612 --> 00:57:13,912
- Right? - It's a little savoury.

1499
00:57:14,352 --> 00:57:15,852
Figuring it by taste is the problem.

1500
00:57:16,352 --> 00:57:17,882
Making them taste it is...

1501
00:57:17,952 --> 00:57:19,882
- It's cruel. - Sung Hoon.

1502
00:57:19,952 --> 00:57:22,282
- Will he be okay? - Poor Sung Hoon.

1503
00:57:22,512 --> 00:57:23,982
It's not something you can touch.

1504
00:57:32,612 --> 00:57:33,912
- Hey, you. - Wait.

1505
00:57:33,952 --> 00:57:36,152
You said you'd do everything.

1506
00:57:36,252 --> 00:57:38,652
- That's not what I meant. - You said that to me.

1507
00:57:38,682 --> 00:57:40,512
You said you didn't know what to do because...

1508
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:42,282
you didn't fear anything.

1509
00:57:42,782 --> 00:57:45,312
(Is this what you meant by having no fear?)

1510
00:57:45,312 --> 00:57:46,752
He asked me, "What should I do?"

1511
00:57:46,782 --> 00:57:49,512
I asked why. He said he didn't fear anything...

1512
00:57:49,552 --> 00:57:51,212
and he was worried about the show getting boring.

1513
00:57:51,282 --> 00:57:53,352
- I mean this is too... - Just eat it then.

1514
00:57:54,552 --> 00:57:56,652
Would you push my head down?

1515
00:57:57,652 --> 00:57:59,512
- Here you go. - Gosh.

1516
00:57:59,612 --> 00:58:01,182
Put more of your tongue inside.

1517
00:58:02,982 --> 00:58:05,882
(He gives up.)

1518
00:58:05,912 --> 00:58:07,352
That's enough.

1519
00:58:07,382 --> 00:58:10,012
(He throws a fit after tasting pork skin.)

1520
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:11,152
Look at him.

1521
00:58:12,652 --> 00:58:14,452
Do you give up?

1522
00:58:15,382 --> 00:58:18,712
His actions are too different from his words.

1523
00:58:19,382 --> 00:58:21,452
He tapped out.

1524
00:58:21,682 --> 00:58:24,152
- Did someone attack you? - I mean this is really...

1525
00:58:24,482 --> 00:58:25,712
Please say the answer.

1526
00:58:26,082 --> 00:58:28,912
It doesn't have any taste.

1527
00:58:29,012 --> 00:58:31,482
- I didn't taste anything at all. - That's right.

1528
00:58:31,582 --> 00:58:35,152
It was like skin of fruit. It was like this.

1529
00:58:35,452 --> 00:58:37,812
- He's getting close. - He's observant.

1530
00:58:38,052 --> 00:58:41,452
It's thin and slippery.

1531
00:58:41,482 --> 00:58:44,012
- It had no taste. - It smelled savoury.

1532
00:58:44,012 --> 00:58:45,652
Gosh, it's so difficult.

1533
00:58:46,352 --> 00:58:48,682
- This isn't it. - In 5, 4, 3...

1534
00:58:48,752 --> 00:58:50,582
Why are you counting down?

1535
00:58:51,552 --> 00:58:53,452
(It's a competition after all.)

1536
00:58:54,052 --> 00:58:56,212
(If Gyeong Gyu gets the answer right, they get tie again.)

1537
00:58:56,312 --> 00:58:58,452
- It had no taste. - We're doomed because of you.

1538
00:58:58,482 --> 00:58:59,612
Goodness.

1539
00:59:00,952 --> 00:59:03,952
(If Team Avengers answers more quickly, they get the hint.)

1540
00:59:04,112 --> 00:59:07,512
(What is Gyeong Gyu's answer?)

1541
00:59:07,512 --> 00:59:08,582
Fritters?

1542
00:59:08,952 --> 00:59:09,982
Is it squid fritters?

1543
00:59:10,212 --> 00:59:11,382
(It's incorrect.)

1544
00:59:11,752 --> 00:59:13,312
- Is it correct? - That wasn't even close.

1545
00:59:13,412 --> 00:59:14,482
They almost got to the answer, though.

1546
00:59:15,212 --> 00:59:17,082
- Hye Jin is so competitive. - This is fun.

1547
00:59:17,112 --> 00:59:18,812
(Team Running Man wins Round Two.)

1548
00:59:18,852 --> 00:59:20,752
Take a look at the second one.

1549
00:59:20,852 --> 00:59:23,082
Hye Jin, you know the second one, right?

1550
00:59:23,082 --> 00:59:24,612
- Is it pork skin? - Yes.

1551
00:59:24,752 --> 00:59:26,212
- How did you know? - It's pork skin.

1552
00:59:26,212 --> 00:59:28,012
(Sorry, was it too difficult?)

1553
00:59:28,412 --> 00:59:31,212
- If I had known... - The winner of this round is...

1554
00:59:31,412 --> 00:59:32,652
Team Running Man.

1555
00:59:32,712 --> 00:59:33,782
(Team Running Man receives a hint on the final mission.)

1556
00:59:33,812 --> 00:59:36,682
- It's still neck and neck. - It's a tie anyway.

1557
00:59:36,712 --> 00:59:37,712
We got one.

1558
00:59:37,752 --> 00:59:39,352
- We got one, too. - That's right.

1559
00:59:39,382 --> 00:59:42,952
The final mission is "Name Tag Elimination".

1560
00:59:43,212 --> 00:59:46,782
Each team decides a lucky and unlucky member from their team...

1561
00:59:46,782 --> 00:59:48,582
and put a sticker under their name tags.

1562
00:59:49,212 --> 00:59:51,352
If you take off a name tag of a lucky member,

1563
00:59:51,382 --> 00:59:54,612
you can not only eliminate the lucky member, but you can also...

1564
00:59:54,612 --> 00:59:57,652
eliminate an additional member of your choice within three minutes.

1565
00:59:57,682 --> 00:59:59,582
(Getting a lucky member will allow you to eliminate one more.)

1566
00:59:59,612 --> 01:00:03,412
If you take off the name tag of an unlucky member, your team loses.

1567
01:00:03,812 --> 01:00:05,012
Will the whole game be over?

1568
01:00:05,082 --> 01:00:07,152
Does the team lose if you take off an unlucky member's name tag?

1569
01:00:07,182 --> 01:00:09,882
- Yes. The game ends then. - We have to be careful.

1570
01:00:09,912 --> 01:00:12,252
What if we take off a tame tag of an unlucky member?

1571
01:00:12,252 --> 01:00:13,752
- Do we get to go home? - Your team loses.

1572
01:00:13,782 --> 01:00:16,482
- I'll be the unlucky member. - Being unlucky is good.

1573
01:00:16,812 --> 01:00:17,912
Let's look for the unlucky member.

1574
01:00:17,912 --> 01:00:20,412
You want it to be over quickly instead of winning?

1575
01:00:20,852 --> 01:00:22,552
Let's look for the unlucky member.

1576
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:24,412
I want to hit him.

1577
01:00:24,452 --> 01:00:25,752
(Which team will be the final winner?)

1578
01:00:27,352 --> 01:00:29,282
Did you decide on the lucky and unlucky member?

1579
01:00:29,712 --> 01:00:31,082
Let's look for the hint.

1580
01:00:31,082 --> 01:00:32,382
Let's look for the hint first.

1581
01:00:32,452 --> 01:00:35,182
Wait. We have to find the hint,

1582
01:00:35,212 --> 01:00:36,812
but this place is too big.

1583
01:00:36,812 --> 01:00:39,212
- I don't know where to start. - Can we go inside the store?

1584
01:00:39,212 --> 01:00:41,982
Don't you think the hint is in here?

1585
01:00:42,082 --> 01:00:45,012
I don't think many people looked through here.

1586
01:00:45,012 --> 01:00:48,152
Where is R?

1587
01:00:48,152 --> 01:00:49,452
(Find the hint on who's lucky and unlucky.)

1588
01:00:49,452 --> 01:00:51,212
(You must find the hint to prevent from losing.)

1589
01:00:51,212 --> 01:00:52,612
This place is huge.

1590
01:00:52,712 --> 01:00:54,112
It really is.

1591
01:00:56,582 --> 01:00:58,412
Even this store is big.

1592
01:00:58,412 --> 01:01:00,852
(Goodness)

1593
01:01:00,882 --> 01:01:02,182
We should leave.

1594
01:01:02,182 --> 01:01:03,252
- Gosh. - I'm sorry.

1595
01:01:03,252 --> 01:01:05,512
- I didn't know. - I'm sorry.

1596
01:01:05,882 --> 01:01:07,282
- I had no idea. - Come on, Jae Seok.

1597
01:01:07,282 --> 01:01:08,282
I really had no idea.

1598
01:01:08,952 --> 01:01:10,382
(Meanwhile, Team Avengers are also searching for hints.)

1599
01:01:10,382 --> 01:01:12,012
It will take forever to look through all these.

1600
01:01:12,312 --> 01:01:13,382
(Goodness!)

1601
01:01:13,382 --> 01:01:15,882
(Did Hee Jun finally find a hint?)

1602
01:01:18,112 --> 01:01:20,282
Can't I have ice cream?

1603
01:01:20,682 --> 01:01:22,582
(You said, you were on a diet.)

1604
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:24,512
This is so hard.

1605
01:01:24,512 --> 01:01:25,512
(Where are the hints?)

1606
01:01:25,512 --> 01:01:26,952
How would it look like?

1607
01:01:28,252 --> 01:01:30,852
- Are you the unlucky member? - Yes.

1608
01:01:31,112 --> 01:01:32,112
Me, too.

1609
01:01:33,052 --> 01:01:34,352
You received a hint, right?

1610
01:01:34,512 --> 01:01:35,612
No, I didn't.

1611
01:01:35,782 --> 01:01:37,682
I thought you received one earlier.

1612
01:01:37,682 --> 01:01:39,552
I'm coming to eliminate you.

1613
01:01:39,682 --> 01:01:42,152
- Can I rip your name tag? - Yes, you can.

1614
01:01:42,152 --> 01:01:43,382
- Seriously? - Yes, I'm serious.

1615
01:01:43,382 --> 01:01:44,412
(You can rip it off if you want to.)

1616
01:01:45,612 --> 01:01:46,882
(Has Kwang Soo released an album before?)

1617
01:01:46,882 --> 01:01:47,912
Well,

1618
01:01:48,582 --> 01:01:50,912
- you can eliminate me now. - Really?

1619
01:01:51,182 --> 01:01:53,012
So only one of you are the unlucky member, right?

1620
01:01:53,612 --> 01:01:55,982
- But the hint said that Ji Hyo... - One of you aren't the unlucky.

1621
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:57,552
and Kwang Soo can't be the unlucky.

1622
01:01:59,182 --> 01:02:00,882
We'll receive a hint soon.

1623
01:02:01,812 --> 01:02:04,712
- I'm pretty confident. - We can eliminate him.

1624
01:02:04,812 --> 01:02:06,912
- We can eliminate Kwang Soo. - Why?

1625
01:02:07,052 --> 01:02:08,152
He didn't release an album...

1626
01:02:12,882 --> 01:02:14,012
Oh, I see.

1627
01:02:15,012 --> 01:02:16,012
I see.

1628
01:02:16,052 --> 01:02:17,752
(Kwang Soo runs off as soon as Key slips out the hint.)

1629
01:02:17,752 --> 01:02:19,512
- What should we do? - Hurry.

1630
01:02:19,512 --> 01:02:21,582
(Who is this?)

1631
01:02:22,512 --> 01:02:23,512
(It's Jong Kook.)

1632
01:02:23,512 --> 01:02:24,812
I just heard their hint.

1633
01:02:25,012 --> 01:02:26,012
Jong Kook!

1634
01:02:26,152 --> 01:02:27,782
- I'm such a fool. - Jong Kook!

1635
01:02:27,782 --> 01:02:28,782
(They can't approach easily because of Jong Kook.)

1636
01:02:28,782 --> 01:02:30,982
Jae Seok, their hint is someone who released an album.

1637
01:02:31,282 --> 01:02:33,212
"Someone who released an album" must be their hint.

1638
01:02:33,212 --> 01:02:36,082
- What? - "Someone who released an album".

1639
01:02:36,112 --> 01:02:39,782
- Why did you let it slip? - We promised not to reveal that.

1640
01:02:39,782 --> 01:02:41,182
- Oh my. - Goodness.

1641
01:02:41,282 --> 01:02:43,052
I must be a fool!

1642
01:02:43,082 --> 01:02:44,812
(Gosh, I must be a food.)

1643
01:02:44,852 --> 01:02:45,882
Ji Hyo!

1644
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,152
What? What's going on?

1645
01:02:47,312 --> 01:02:51,182
"Someone who released an album" must be their hint.

1646
01:02:51,412 --> 01:02:53,282
- You mean that's the hint? - Yes, for the unlucky member.

1647
01:02:53,982 --> 01:02:55,112
So it's about our unlucky member.

1648
01:02:55,412 --> 01:02:57,082
Ji Hyo, run away!

1649
01:02:57,852 --> 01:02:58,852
(We are their targets.)

1650
01:02:58,852 --> 01:02:59,882
What's happening?

1651
01:02:59,882 --> 01:03:01,382
(We are their targets.)

1652
01:03:02,712 --> 01:03:04,512
(Team Avengers are on their way to find other hints.)

1653
01:03:04,512 --> 01:03:07,052
- This place is suspicious. - There's nothing in here.

1654
01:03:07,052 --> 01:03:10,552
- This place is suspicious. - I feel there must be something.

1655
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:13,052
It's somewhat suspicious.

1656
01:03:14,952 --> 01:03:15,982
What?

1657
01:03:18,752 --> 01:03:21,382
- Oh, my. It's here. - Did you really find one?

1658
01:03:21,382 --> 01:03:23,482
- Where did you find it? - Good job.

1659
01:03:23,512 --> 01:03:26,612
It was in here. I spotted it when I was trying to sit on the swing.

1660
01:03:26,612 --> 01:03:28,052
You are amazing.

1661
01:03:30,012 --> 01:03:32,682
- Nice job. - What? What's this?

1662
01:03:32,752 --> 01:03:35,612
You'll get a hint if you choose the yogurt without vinegar.

1663
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:37,382
- It's completely random. - I see.

1664
01:03:37,382 --> 01:03:39,682
Since you have the box, why don't you try to pick one?

1665
01:03:40,212 --> 01:03:41,212
Gyeong Gyu.

1666
01:03:41,482 --> 01:03:43,552
Look at the colour. I can't tell from the colour.

1667
01:03:44,012 --> 01:03:47,112
- I think number 7 is the yogurt. - Is this number 7?

1668
01:03:47,112 --> 01:03:49,512
- Isn't this number 1? - It's number 1.

1669
01:03:49,512 --> 01:03:51,082
How can you say this is seven?

1670
01:03:51,312 --> 01:03:53,812
My goodness. How could this be seven?

1671
01:03:53,812 --> 01:03:55,012
- I thought it was 7. - This is number 1.

1672
01:03:55,812 --> 01:03:56,982
- Please choose. - I choose number two.

1673
01:03:57,012 --> 01:03:58,812
(Gyeong Gyu chooses number 2.)

1674
01:03:59,212 --> 01:04:00,682
- Now, drink it. - Yes.

1675
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:02,282
Does he need to drink it all at once? Oh, my.

1676
01:04:02,612 --> 01:04:05,312
- I think I know what it is. - What if it's the vinegar?

1677
01:04:05,312 --> 01:04:06,582
(What will it be?)

1678
01:04:06,582 --> 01:04:08,052
(He drinks it down.)

1679
01:04:08,682 --> 01:04:09,912
(It has to the yogurt to receive a hint.)

1680
01:04:09,912 --> 01:04:11,612
This is amazing. Is that the vinegar?

1681
01:04:12,652 --> 01:04:13,812
(Moving his mouth)

1682
01:04:13,812 --> 01:04:15,182
- Is it the yogurt? - It's the yogurt!

1683
01:04:16,612 --> 01:04:18,882
- Really? - Are you serious?

1684
01:04:19,152 --> 01:04:21,882
I noticed it when you said "number seven".

1685
01:04:22,412 --> 01:04:23,912
Let's see what number one is.

1686
01:04:26,312 --> 01:04:28,212
(Oh, dear.)

1687
01:04:29,712 --> 01:04:32,482
(Congratulations. Number one was the vinegar.)

1688
01:04:32,482 --> 01:04:35,082
- That was amazing. - Well, it's...

1689
01:04:35,112 --> 01:04:37,912
- Your face is turning red. - I think he is bloating.

1690
01:04:38,912 --> 01:04:40,982
- This is quite fun. - Yes, it is. This is exciting.

1691
01:04:41,052 --> 01:04:43,252
The hint will be sent to your mission phone.

1692
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:45,112
- The mission phone. - Oh, it's here.

1693
01:04:45,112 --> 01:04:47,112
- This fast? - It was really fast.

1694
01:04:47,112 --> 01:04:49,752
- It's because we're standing close. - Such a nice world we live in.

1695
01:04:50,182 --> 01:04:51,912
He could've just said it rather than sending a message.

1696
01:04:52,512 --> 01:04:54,012
- I know. - It's a nice world.

1697
01:04:54,012 --> 01:04:56,012
What a nice world we live in today.

1698
01:04:56,012 --> 01:04:58,712
- The unlucky member is single? - Unmarried?

1699
01:04:59,152 --> 01:05:01,852
- Then it must be Ji Hyo or Gary. - Ji Hyo or Gary.

1700
01:05:02,112 --> 01:05:05,412
- Ji Hyo or Gary. - Kwang Soo is also single.

1701
01:05:05,582 --> 01:05:07,112
Or Jong Kook! There are four.

1702
01:05:07,112 --> 01:05:08,912
- There are so many. - Among them,

1703
01:05:08,912 --> 01:05:11,552
- Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo didn't... - They didn't released an album.

1704
01:05:11,582 --> 01:05:14,682
- It must be Jong Kook or Gary. - Jong Kook or Gary.

1705
01:05:14,682 --> 01:05:16,852
- Jong Kook or Gary. - So it's one of them.

1706
01:05:16,882 --> 01:05:20,512
- Jong Kook or Gary? - Yes. The unlucky is 1 of the 2.

1707
01:05:21,582 --> 01:05:24,012
There are four unmarried members.

1708
01:05:24,012 --> 01:05:27,512
We found out that Jong Kook or Gary must be the unlucky member.

1709
01:05:27,512 --> 01:05:29,412
- They are all over there, now. - Are they together?

1710
01:05:29,412 --> 01:05:31,182
- All of them are there. - Let's go.

1711
01:05:31,312 --> 01:05:33,512
- Where? Where? - Sung Hoon could be the unlucky.

1712
01:05:33,512 --> 01:05:37,952
- Right. - Key is very active.

1713
01:05:38,212 --> 01:05:40,282
- Dong Hyun might be the one. - I think I saw someone here.

1714
01:05:40,282 --> 01:05:41,782
- There she is. - What?

1715
01:05:41,782 --> 01:05:44,812
- It's Hye Jin. I feel sorry. - We need to eliminate her.

1716
01:05:44,812 --> 01:05:45,912
Where are the others?

1717
01:05:45,912 --> 01:05:47,112
(Is Hye Jin in trouble?)

1718
01:05:47,952 --> 01:05:49,512
(Here you go.)

1719
01:05:50,252 --> 01:05:53,152
(Is Hye Jin the unlucky member?)

1720
01:05:53,152 --> 01:05:54,152
(She tries to eliminate Kwang Soo.)

1721
01:05:55,252 --> 01:05:57,412
- Wait a minute, Hye Jin. - I'll do it.

1722
01:05:57,412 --> 01:05:59,152
- Hye Jin. - Can I eliminate you?

1723
01:05:59,712 --> 01:06:01,212
(How dare you?)

1724
01:06:01,212 --> 01:06:02,882
You rip mine, and I'll rip yours.

1725
01:06:02,882 --> 01:06:05,212
- Can I eliminate you? - Can we really do this?

1726
01:06:05,782 --> 01:06:08,012
- I have to go watch soccer. - She was trying to rip mine off.

1727
01:06:08,012 --> 01:06:09,282
I have to hurry home to watch the soccer game.

1728
01:06:09,282 --> 01:06:11,682
- You mean you need to go home? - Can I rip it off?

1729
01:06:11,682 --> 01:06:12,682
Sure.

1730
01:06:13,012 --> 01:06:15,512
Then we can all call it a day.

1731
01:06:15,512 --> 01:06:18,582
- Come on. - Why are you doing this?

1732
01:06:18,582 --> 01:06:19,852
- Eliminate her. - Leave it.

1733
01:06:20,412 --> 01:06:22,782
(I don't think Hye Jin is the unlucky member.)

1734
01:06:22,782 --> 01:06:24,052
(Ripping)

1735
01:06:24,052 --> 01:06:25,752
- Come on. - You ripped mine.

1736
01:06:25,752 --> 01:06:27,412
- Eliminate her. - Hold on for now.

1737
01:06:27,512 --> 01:06:28,952
(He ripped mine.)

1738
01:06:28,952 --> 01:06:29,982
(She's such a good actress.)

1739
01:06:29,982 --> 01:06:32,012
- Didn't he just rip mine? - You are such a good actress.

1740
01:06:32,112 --> 01:06:33,112
They're here.

1741
01:06:33,212 --> 01:06:34,482
(Team Avengers is here.)

1742
01:06:35,182 --> 01:06:37,412
- Why? Go ahead. - Don't come near.

1743
01:06:37,412 --> 01:06:39,012
(Finally, they are here.)

1744
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:41,312
- Wait a minute. - Hey!

1745
01:06:41,812 --> 01:06:43,382
- What's going on? - No, it's fine. Eliminate me.

1746
01:06:43,382 --> 01:06:44,652
Hey, don't go there.

1747
01:06:45,112 --> 01:06:46,382
(Running Man members could be hiding...)

1748
01:06:46,382 --> 01:06:48,082
- Don't go near them. - Gyeong Gyu.

1749
01:06:48,212 --> 01:06:50,112
(like this.)

1750
01:06:51,512 --> 01:06:54,282
(Jong Kook was hiding when Team Avengers arrived.)

1751
01:06:54,282 --> 01:06:56,052
(He sneaks from the back.)

1752
01:06:56,782 --> 01:06:58,482
(Gary, who was also hiding, approaches.)

1753
01:06:59,912 --> 01:07:00,952
(Ripping)

1754
01:07:00,982 --> 01:07:02,112
(Sneaking)

1755
01:07:02,912 --> 01:07:05,612
(Jong Kook and Gary make a surprise attack.)

1756
01:07:05,612 --> 01:07:07,012
- He's eliminated. - They attacked from the back.

1757
01:07:07,012 --> 01:07:08,212
(Gyeong Gyu was not on the list from the beginning.)

1758
01:07:08,282 --> 01:07:11,112
- What happened? - Let's leave. Let's go.

1759
01:07:11,112 --> 01:07:13,282
- We can't be here. - What's going on?

1760
01:07:13,312 --> 01:07:14,982
We have to get Kwang Soo.

1761
01:07:15,812 --> 01:07:17,212
(Is Gary in trouble?)

1762
01:07:18,982 --> 01:07:20,282
(He escapes.)

1763
01:07:20,282 --> 01:07:22,212
Don't eliminate Gary or Jong Kook!

1764
01:07:22,212 --> 01:07:24,582
(If we eliminate them rashly, we may end up losing the game.)

1765
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:25,982
Do not eliminate Gary or Jong Kook!

1766
01:07:26,212 --> 01:07:28,152
(They are running after them.)

1767
01:07:28,152 --> 01:07:29,582
It's okay to eliminate him.

1768
01:07:29,582 --> 01:07:30,682
(Ripping)

1769
01:07:31,112 --> 01:07:32,952
- He's out. - Seok Jin is eliminated.

1770
01:07:32,952 --> 01:07:34,512
(Seok Jin is eliminated.)

1771
01:07:34,512 --> 01:07:35,652
- He's eliminated. - Oh my.

1772
01:07:36,612 --> 01:07:37,912
(Jae Seok is cornered.)

1773
01:07:37,912 --> 01:07:39,212
Eliminate Jae Seok!

1774
01:07:39,212 --> 01:07:40,652
(Eliminate Jae Seok!)

1775
01:07:40,852 --> 01:07:43,012
- Hold on. - Eliminate him!

1776
01:07:43,012 --> 01:07:44,282
(They're vigorously attacking Jae Seok.)

1777
01:07:44,282 --> 01:07:45,712
- Wait a minute. - It's fine. Eliminate him.

1778
01:07:46,112 --> 01:07:47,482
(Gary attempts to rescue Jae Seok.)

1779
01:07:47,512 --> 01:07:49,052
Hey! Get back! Not him!

1780
01:07:49,052 --> 01:07:51,152
(Sung Hoon, you can't eliminate Gary!)

1781
01:07:51,152 --> 01:07:53,282
(If he's the unlucky member, then we are doomed.)

1782
01:07:53,812 --> 01:07:54,952
Leave Gary alone!

1783
01:07:54,952 --> 01:07:57,212
(They can attack other members as much as they like.)

1784
01:07:57,782 --> 01:07:59,682
- Jong Kook! - Hyung Bin, Hyung Bin.

1785
01:08:01,112 --> 01:08:02,512
(Screeching)

1786
01:08:04,082 --> 01:08:05,752
Eliminate Hyung Bin.

1787
01:08:05,812 --> 01:08:07,412
(Haha is cornered.)

1788
01:08:08,352 --> 01:08:09,382
We got him.

1789
01:08:09,412 --> 01:08:10,412
Haha is eliminated.

1790
01:08:11,182 --> 01:08:12,312
(Jong Kook sneaks in.)

1791
01:08:12,482 --> 01:08:14,222
Gary, eliminate him. Eliminate Hyung Bin.

1792
01:08:14,222 --> 01:08:16,582
(Will he rip off Hye Jin's name tag?)

1793
01:08:17,552 --> 01:08:19,112
(Earlier)

1794
01:08:19,112 --> 01:08:20,282
Isn't this the hint box?

1795
01:08:20,282 --> 01:08:22,722
(Ji Hyo found a hint box.)

1796
01:08:23,952 --> 01:08:26,512
(A hint will be given if you pick the normal chopsticks.)

1797
01:08:27,722 --> 01:08:29,012
(It's a success.)

1798
01:08:29,012 --> 01:08:32,512
(The unlucky member of Team Avengers uses a nickname.)

1799
01:08:32,512 --> 01:08:34,252
The unlucky member uses a nickname.

1800
01:08:34,722 --> 01:08:36,382
- A nickname? - Yes.

1801
01:08:36,812 --> 01:08:37,912
(If so...)

1802
01:08:38,452 --> 01:08:40,912
(Since Hye Jin uses her real name, she can't be the unlucky.)

1803
01:08:40,912 --> 01:08:41,912
(Ripping)

1804
01:08:43,052 --> 01:08:45,112
(Hye Jin is eliminated.)

1805
01:08:45,112 --> 01:08:46,112
Eliminate him.

1806
01:08:46,112 --> 01:08:48,112
(Kwang Soo is confronting Key and Sung Hoon.)

1807
01:08:49,222 --> 01:08:50,782
(Ripping)

1808
01:08:50,782 --> 01:08:52,582
(He succeeds.)

1809
01:08:53,222 --> 01:08:55,582
(Kwang Soo is eliminated.)

1810
01:08:57,222 --> 01:08:58,222
(Team Avengers repaid their debt.)

1811
01:08:58,222 --> 01:09:00,222
- Good job. - Guys!

1812
01:09:01,012 --> 01:09:02,012
Goodness.

1813
01:09:04,552 --> 01:09:06,812
- Are you all right? - Jae Seok.

1814
01:09:07,012 --> 01:09:09,112
(Gyeong Gyu is coaching his team even when he's eliminated.)

1815
01:09:09,412 --> 01:09:11,012
Who's that behind Jae Seok?

1816
01:09:11,012 --> 01:09:12,052
(Eliminating Jae Seok is only a matter of time.)

1817
01:09:15,482 --> 01:09:17,112
(Jong Kook appears.)

1818
01:09:17,112 --> 01:09:18,782
Hey. No way! Dong Hyun!

1819
01:09:19,812 --> 01:09:21,482
- Goodness. - No way! Dong Hyun!

1820
01:09:21,482 --> 01:09:23,052
(He rips off Dong Hyun's name tag.)

1821
01:09:23,052 --> 01:09:24,952
(Dong Hyun is the lucky member!)

1822
01:09:25,052 --> 01:09:26,852
Dong Hyun is the lucky member.

1823
01:09:26,852 --> 01:09:27,852
(Team Avengers' lucky member is Dong Hyun.)

1824
01:09:28,312 --> 01:09:31,312
We need to be prudent. Lucky member shouldn't get eliminated.

1825
01:09:31,882 --> 01:09:34,512
- Yes, he shouldn't get eliminated. - So he needs to be strong.

1826
01:09:34,512 --> 01:09:36,852
- I suggest Dong Hyun... - Right.

1827
01:09:37,412 --> 01:09:38,952
- or Sung Hoon. - Okay. Let's do that.

1828
01:09:39,782 --> 01:09:41,912
Gary or Jong Kook is the unlucky member.

1829
01:09:42,182 --> 01:09:43,682
We'll choose one to be eliminated.

1830
01:09:43,722 --> 01:09:45,852
- We should've eliminated Jae Seok. - Be careful!

1831
01:09:45,912 --> 01:09:48,082
- Please be cautious. - In 1, 2, 3.

1832
01:09:48,382 --> 01:09:49,512
- Hyung Bin. - Hyung Bin.

1833
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:51,552
- Hyung Bin is out. - He's out.

1834
01:09:51,612 --> 01:09:52,882
- Me? - Yes.

1835
01:09:53,012 --> 01:09:55,312
- Why? - You mean this is the end?

1836
01:09:55,382 --> 01:09:57,012
We also had a hint.

1837
01:09:57,382 --> 01:09:59,112
- You're not the unlucky member. - The hint says so.

1838
01:09:59,512 --> 01:10:00,682
What do you take us for?

1839
01:10:00,912 --> 01:10:03,512
We already know you're not the unlucky member.

1840
01:10:03,512 --> 01:10:04,812
Any last words?

1841
01:10:04,812 --> 01:10:06,382
(He rips off his own name tag.)

1842
01:10:06,382 --> 01:10:09,052
- Nice. - Will you give me back my name tag?

1843
01:10:09,582 --> 01:10:11,052
It's okay to eliminate Jae Seok.

1844
01:10:12,112 --> 01:10:16,312
(Remaining team members)

1845
01:10:17,112 --> 01:10:18,682
There's a possibility that...

1846
01:10:18,782 --> 01:10:22,412
they may think I'm too passive to be the unlucky member.

1847
01:10:22,412 --> 01:10:25,012
I used guerrilla tactics and not attacked them actively.

1848
01:10:25,012 --> 01:10:27,512
But they might have perceived you as being active.

1849
01:10:27,512 --> 01:10:31,482
Since this is hit-or-miss, our option is Sung Hoon or Key.

1850
01:10:31,782 --> 01:10:34,752
We'll have to make a choice and eliminate one. There's no other way.

1851
01:10:34,752 --> 01:10:38,152
No, we have no idea what will happen when the situation gets tense.

1852
01:10:38,222 --> 01:10:39,612
- Maybe it's Key. - It's so uncertain.

1853
01:10:39,612 --> 01:10:41,912
I'm sure they are more confused than us.

1854
01:10:42,552 --> 01:10:44,382
- You're right. - Yes, I'm sure they are.

1855
01:10:45,612 --> 01:10:47,452
Even if we have the hints,

1856
01:10:48,582 --> 01:10:50,912
taking the bull by the horns is the only way.

1857
01:10:50,912 --> 01:10:51,912
- There's no way to eliminate them. - Right.

1858
01:10:52,112 --> 01:10:55,412
- I think Jong Kook is the lucky. - In order for us to win,

1859
01:10:55,412 --> 01:10:57,852
we need to eliminate everyone except the unlucky member.

1860
01:10:57,852 --> 01:11:00,752
I think we should eliminate Jong Kook and Jae Seok.

1861
01:11:00,752 --> 01:11:02,382
What about Ji Hyo? She's still alive.

1862
01:11:02,852 --> 01:11:04,152
- Right, she's still alive. - Yes.

1863
01:11:04,152 --> 01:11:05,152
Then...

1864
01:11:05,412 --> 01:11:07,882
- She must be the lucky member. - Yes.

1865
01:11:07,882 --> 01:11:08,912
Is she?

1866
01:11:08,982 --> 01:11:10,912
That's why they told her to hide and not to roam around.

1867
01:11:12,182 --> 01:11:14,312
- They must be over there. - Where? There?

1868
01:11:14,412 --> 01:11:15,482
I can hear them.

1869
01:11:15,552 --> 01:11:17,222
- There they are. - Yes. I can see them.

1870
01:11:17,222 --> 01:11:19,052
- Where are they? - Right over there.

1871
01:11:19,552 --> 01:11:22,482
They are approaching us. They must have found all the hints already.

1872
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:25,752
Come on, Hee Jun. Let's just fight.

1873
01:11:26,612 --> 01:11:28,052
Let's finish this quickly.

1874
01:11:28,352 --> 01:11:29,682
- Yes. - It's hit-or-miss now.

1875
01:11:29,752 --> 01:11:32,512
Remember. Jong Kook isn't our first target.

1876
01:11:32,512 --> 01:11:33,852
Come on. Let's do it.

1877
01:11:34,282 --> 01:11:35,852
- Hee Jun. This way. - There's Jae Seok.

1878
01:11:35,852 --> 01:11:37,982
Go. Let's rip his name tag first.

1879
01:11:37,982 --> 01:11:40,482
(They are sure that Jae Seok isn't the unlucky member.)

1880
01:11:42,782 --> 01:11:44,012
- Rip it off. - There.

1881
01:11:44,082 --> 01:11:46,052
(Jae Seok is eliminated.)

1882
01:11:47,482 --> 01:11:49,852
- Be careful. - Go for Jong Kook's name tag.

1883
01:11:49,852 --> 01:11:51,052
(One of them is the unlucky member.)

1884
01:11:52,252 --> 01:11:54,782
(Who is the unlucky one?)

1885
01:11:56,512 --> 01:11:57,852
Come on, Jong Kook. Please.

1886
01:11:57,852 --> 01:11:58,952
(They are wrestling hand-to-hand.)

1887
01:12:00,012 --> 01:12:01,222
Come on.

1888
01:12:01,222 --> 01:12:03,452
Jong Kook. Do you call this a variety show?

1889
01:12:03,552 --> 01:12:04,752
This is a fighting show.

1890
01:12:04,982 --> 01:12:07,282
(Sung Hoon reaches out for a name tag.)

1891
01:12:08,512 --> 01:12:10,652
(Is he trying to rip Jong Kook's name tag...)

1892
01:12:10,652 --> 01:12:13,112
(or Gary's?)

1893
01:12:15,352 --> 01:12:18,012
(Whom is he going to attack?)

1894
01:12:19,112 --> 01:12:20,352
Maybe there isn't anything.

1895
01:12:20,352 --> 01:12:21,482
(Sung Hoon goes for Jong Kook's!)

1896
01:12:22,452 --> 01:12:23,452
- Gosh. - What?

1897
01:12:23,882 --> 01:12:26,152
(He rips off Jong Kook's name tag.)

1898
01:12:26,982 --> 01:12:31,152
(Team Avengers loses right away if Jong Kook is the unlucky member.)

1899
01:12:31,852 --> 01:12:36,782
(If Jong Kook is the lucky member, they can eliminate Ji Hyo and win.)

1900
01:12:37,882 --> 01:12:39,652
(How will this battle end?)

1901
01:12:39,652 --> 01:12:40,722
- Gosh. - What?

1902
01:12:41,812 --> 01:12:44,552
(Jong Kook is the lucky member.)

1903
01:12:44,952 --> 01:12:46,012
Where is it?

1904
01:12:46,152 --> 01:12:47,312
Where is his name tag?

1905
01:12:47,352 --> 01:12:49,222
(We did it.)

1906
01:12:49,382 --> 01:12:51,052
I couldn't rip his name tag off.

1907
01:12:52,982 --> 01:12:54,222
(Hee Jun found a hint box.)

1908
01:12:54,222 --> 01:12:56,252
- I found one. Isn't this the one? - Where is it?

1909
01:12:56,252 --> 01:12:57,282
- That's right. - Yes.

1910
01:12:57,382 --> 01:12:58,882
I'll get a hint if I eat the one without mustard in it.

1911
01:12:59,222 --> 01:13:00,382
Can we check?

1912
01:13:00,682 --> 01:13:01,912
I succeeded.

1913
01:13:02,382 --> 01:13:04,482
The unlucky member of Team Running Man uses a nickname.

1914
01:13:05,412 --> 01:13:08,852
(Gary, who uses his nickname, was the unlucky member.)

1915
01:13:10,482 --> 01:13:14,082
(Unlucky)

1916
01:13:14,222 --> 01:13:17,222
- Choose one to be eliminated. - We will eliminate Ji Hyo.

1917
01:13:18,612 --> 01:13:21,152
(Ji Hyo is eliminated.)

1918
01:13:21,152 --> 01:13:22,282
All right.

1919
01:13:22,282 --> 01:13:23,682
Jae Seok shouldn't have been eliminated.

1920
01:13:24,452 --> 01:13:25,882
Team Avengers has won.

1921
01:13:25,882 --> 01:13:28,252
(Team Avengers has won.)

1922
01:13:28,252 --> 01:13:30,912
The sequel is always better than the first.

1923
01:13:32,282 --> 01:13:35,782
Today, we had Running Man versus Avengers Part 2...

1924
01:13:36,082 --> 01:13:37,252
and Team Avengers won.

1925
01:13:37,252 --> 01:13:40,012
(Sung Hoon was the ace of Team Avengers today.)

1926
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:43,382
We will give this golden shield to Team Avengers.

1927
01:13:43,382 --> 01:13:46,582
(The golden shield will be given to Team Avengers as the prize.)

1928
01:13:47,652 --> 01:13:49,852
Do you get it? Be modest.

1929
01:13:50,352 --> 01:13:52,722
Why do you live like that? Act your age.

1930
01:13:52,722 --> 01:13:54,682
- Can you just do it? - You shouldn't scold him.

1931
01:13:55,482 --> 01:13:56,812
- I'm not done yet. - Let's finish here.

1932
01:13:56,812 --> 01:13:58,452
(Waiting to be penalised is more tiring than penalty itself.)

1933
01:13:58,452 --> 01:13:59,682
That must be more tiring.

1934
01:14:00,912 --> 01:14:02,812
(Gyeong Gyu slaps his forehead.)

1935
01:14:03,582 --> 01:14:04,882
Did you hear that sound?

1936
01:14:04,882 --> 01:14:06,312
He fell with a thud.

1937
01:14:06,312 --> 01:14:07,652
The sound resonated in this place.

1938
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:09,482
(Running Man vs Avengers Part 3 coming soon!)

1939
01:14:09,682 --> 01:14:10,722
(It's time for Running Man TV.)

1940
01:14:10,722 --> 01:14:11,752

01:14:19,782 --> 01:14:21,252
(Show how charming you are.)

1947
01:14:21,252 --> 01:14:22,852
(Kwang Soo's channel)

1948
01:14:23,112 --> 01:14:26,412

01:14:31,482 --> 01:14:37,222
