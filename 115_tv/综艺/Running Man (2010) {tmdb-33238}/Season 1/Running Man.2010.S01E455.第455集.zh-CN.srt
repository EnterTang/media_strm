
1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Did you ever really plan on going down South?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
How could you ask that?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This just came up.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You can alWays get another job at a grocery store.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I can't just Walk into an ad agency.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I can't believe you.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
All you do is complain about that place and those people.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That's not true.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Well, I’m going.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I guess I’ll just hop in Billy Kaplan's bus

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,000
With ten strangers.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Why can't it Wait?

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
1 9th Street.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This Was all supposed to be ours.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I keep thinking What Would have happened if Dad had lived.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
He'd be on his knees to us.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What about all that money Dad gave to Lincoln Center?

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Get that back.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You can't take a donation back.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Listen, I’m as upset as you are.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We're about to finally buy in Millbrook.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
How long can she afford to live?

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
By golly, Pete, maybe We can get rid of her tonight.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
RemberRope?

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Well, look, all We have to do is go over there, get her signature,

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
mourn over the loss of our birthright, and move on.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I hate going there.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The smell.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
To the end of the line.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Does Judy Want kids?

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We have a five-year plan, although secretly I think Judy hopes

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We're that childless couple people invite over.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Trudy?

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We've tried.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That must be disappointing.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Adoption.

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
People do that.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
They do.
