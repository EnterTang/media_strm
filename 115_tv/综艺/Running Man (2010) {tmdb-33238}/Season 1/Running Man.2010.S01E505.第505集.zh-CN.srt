1
00:00:03,345 --> 00:00:04,971
- 嘿，雷
- 把门关上。关上！
- Hey, Ray.
- Shut the door. Shut it!

2
00:00:05,013 --> 00:00:07,390
- 为什么，为什么？
- 关上门，别乱动！
- Why why?
- Shut the door and don't waIk anywhere!

3
00:00:07,432 --> 00:00:09,100
- 别动！
- 你吓着我了，兄弟！
- Don't move!
- You're freakin' me out, man!

4
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:12,604
- 到底怎么了？
- 我得――我弄丢了仓鼠，
- What's going on?
- I've gotta-- I Iost the hamster,

5
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:15,065
爱丽的仓鼠
AIIy's hamster.

6
00:00:15,106 --> 00:00:19,486
- 哦，不，它跑出来了？
- 是的，他跑出来了。见了鬼了
- Oh, no, he got out?
- Yes, he got out. What the heII?

7
00:00:24,616 --> 00:00:27,202
快点。黛比拉和孩子们
再过一小时就回来了
Come on. Debra and the kids are
gonna be home in an hour.

8
00:00:27,244 --> 00:00:30,080
你得帮我找找
You gotta heIp me
Iook for him.

9
00:00:30,121 --> 00:00:31,998
他们把你一个人丢在家
一个周末，
They Ieave you aIone
for one weekend,

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,418
这房子里唯一一个其他的活物就得逃走
and the onIy other Iiving thing
in the house needs to run away.

11
00:00:41,077 --> 00:00:43,287
妈，你在干嘛？
你不帮帮我吗？
Ma, you're supposed
to heIp me.

12
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:45,039
你看看这些面包渣子
WouId you Iook
at these crumbs?

13
00:00:45,081 --> 00:00:46,999
黛比拉就这么收拾厨房，
The way Debra
keeps this kitchen,

14
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,919
这屋子里没闹仓鼠灾
已经是奇迹了
it's a miracIe this pIace isn't
infested with hamsters.

15
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:54,674
不在地下室里
He's not in the basement.

16
00:00:56,426 --> 00:01:00,805
爸，我先说清楚，
我们要活的
Dad, just so you know, we want
the hamster brought back aIive.

17
00:01:00,805 --> 00:01:02,765
这得看它了
That's up to him.

18
00:01:04,434 --> 00:01:06,519
好了，我检查完了整个顶层
AII right, I checked out
the entire top fIoor

19
00:01:06,561 --> 00:01:08,521
没看到粗面包的影子
and no sign
of PumpernickeI.

20
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:11,524
顺便说一句，
抽屉上层不是藏值钱东西的好地方
By the way, you shouIdn't hide
vaIuabIes in your top drawer.

21
00:01:11,566 --> 00:01:14,235
并且你该买身新内衣了
And you couId use some
new underwear, Raymond.

22
00:01:15,778 --> 00:01:19,073
我会记在购物单上的，亲爱的
I'II put it on the Iist, dear.

23
00:01:19,115 --> 00:01:20,575
再过一小时他们就回来了
They're gonna
be back in an hour.

24
00:01:20,658 --> 00:01:22,618
我去买个新仓鼠
I'm gonna go
get a new hamster.

25
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,704
- 你不能这样
- 为什么不？
- You can't do that.
- Why not?

26
00:01:24,746 --> 00:01:27,039
它们看起来都一样。
他不会看出来的
They aII Iook aIike.
She'II never know the difference.

27
00:01:27,081 --> 00:01:29,167
你打算这么骗你女儿？
You wouId Iie
to your daughter Iike that?

28
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:31,127
我不会骗她的。
我只会这么说：
I'm not gonna Iie.
I'm just gonna say,

29
00:01:31,169 --> 00:01:33,838
“你的仓鼠，亲爱的。”
''Here's your hamster, honey.''

30
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,256
我要告诉爱丽
I'm teIIing AIIy.

31
00:01:35,298 --> 00:01:39,051
- 你管好自己的事吧
- 你找不到一样的
- You just mind your business.
- You're not gonna find one

32
00:01:39,093 --> 00:01:40,970
哦，是的
- that Iooks the same.
- Oh, yeah.

33
00:01:41,012 --> 00:01:43,181
我上哪去找一只棕色的仓鼠啊？
Where am I gonna find
a brown hamster?

34
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,268
我不能合伙这么撒谎
I cannot be a party
to that Iie.

35
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,562
你闭嘴就好了，条子
You just keep your
mouth shut, Copper.

36
00:01:52,982 --> 00:01:54,984
别叫我闭嘴
Don't teII me to shut up.

37
00:01:55,026 --> 00:01:57,361
- 我来让你闭上怎么样？
- 我就在这等着你！
- How about I make you?
- How about I'm right over here?

38
00:01:57,403 --> 00:01:59,864
- 我上你那去怎么样？
- 放马过来呀！
- How about I come over there?
- Bring it on!

39
00:01:59,906 --> 00:02:01,824
- 我全放
- 停下！
- I'II bring everything on.
- Stop it!

40
00:02:01,866 --> 00:02:04,702
乖，孩子们
Be nice, boys.

41
00:02:04,744 --> 00:02:06,662
好了。
咱们都需要喘口气
AII right now.
We aII need a break.

42
00:02:06,704 --> 00:02:08,456
先吃点小零食，
Let's have a snack,

43
00:02:08,498 --> 00:02:11,209
然后说不定粗面包
听到咱们吃东西，
and maybe if PumpernickeI
hears us enjoying our food,

44
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,877
它就会过来了
he'II join us.

45
00:02:14,545 --> 00:02:17,048
它可以分点你的。
别想跟我抢
He can have some of yours.
He's not getting any of mine.

46
00:02:22,136 --> 00:02:23,930
- 爸
- 怎么了？
- Dad.
- What?

47
00:02:23,971 --> 00:02:26,265
我正要办这个呢。
你起来好吗？
I'm trying to move it.
CouId you get up?

48
00:02:26,307 --> 00:02:28,267
捎我一段
Give me a ride.

49
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:34,399
怎么了，妈，怎么了？
What is it, Ma, what?

50
00:02:37,276 --> 00:02:39,487
哦，老兄，它在这
Oh boy, there he is.

51
00:02:41,697 --> 00:02:43,616
- 哪？
- 就在那
- Where?
- Right there.

52
00:02:43,658 --> 00:02:45,827
什么？我只看到雪糕
What? AII I see
is fudge pops.

53
00:02:45,868 --> 00:02:48,913
看看左边长毛的那个
Look at the hairy one
on the Ieft.

54
00:02:58,798 --> 00:02:59,966
什么？
What?

55
00:03:02,552 --> 00:03:04,554
我靠
HoIy crap.

56
00:03:09,392 --> 00:03:11,519
你做了什么？
What did you do?

57
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:14,105
我做了什么？
什么，你以为我把它放进去的？
What did I do?
What, you think I put him in?

58
00:03:14,147 --> 00:03:16,065
我不知道它怎么进去的
I don't know how
he got in there.

59
00:03:16,107 --> 00:03:18,943
哦，它自己爬进密封的冰箱的？
Oh, he cIimbed into
an airtight freezer by himseIf?

60
00:03:18,985 --> 00:03:21,571
我不知道这到底怎么发生的
I don't know how this
couId have happened.

61
00:03:21,612 --> 00:03:24,532
我打扫完仓鼠笼子，
I cIeaned out
the hamster cage,

62
00:03:24,574 --> 00:03:27,493
我准是没把笼子合严实
and I must not have snapped
the cage back together tight enough.

63
00:03:27,535 --> 00:03:30,455
等等，等一等。
然后我去了食品店
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Then I went grocery shopping.

64
00:03:30,455 --> 00:03:33,374
你把食品袋放桌上了？
Did you have
the groceries on the tabIe?

65
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,293
它一定是爬进袋子里了
He must have cIimbed
into the bag

66
00:03:35,334 --> 00:03:37,295
有雪糕的那个
that had the fudge pops.

67
00:03:37,295 --> 00:03:40,089
看哪，看看它的小胡子。
全是雪糕
Look, Iook at his whiskers.
They're aII fudgy.

68
00:03:40,131 --> 00:03:42,175
呃唔！
Ew!

69
00:03:45,762 --> 00:03:47,930
它的最后一顿饭
His Iast meaI.

70
00:03:47,972 --> 00:03:51,017
可怜的粗面包
Poor PumpernickeI.

71
00:03:51,058 --> 00:03:52,894
爱丽一定会恨我的
AIIy's gonna hate me.

72
00:03:52,894 --> 00:03:55,438
- 嘿，给我一根
- 别添乱？
- Hey, give me one of those.
- WiII you get out of here?

73
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,690
喔喔，等等，等一下
Whoa whoa, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

74
00:03:57,732 --> 00:04:00,443
- 也许它还没死
- 什么，你讲笑话呢？
- He may not be dead.
- What, are you kidding?

75
00:04:00,485 --> 00:04:03,154
你都能拿那个砸胡桃了
You couId crack a waInut
with that thing.

76
00:04:03,196 --> 00:04:05,865
不，我是认真的。
它也许只是冷冻保存了
No, I'm serious. He may be
cryogenicaIIy preserved

77
00:04:05,907 --> 00:04:08,076
暂时失去生命迹象而已
in a state of
suspended animation.

78
00:04:09,827 --> 00:04:11,829
它死了，好吗？
我得去买只新的
He's dead, aII right?
I have to buy another one now.

79
00:04:11,871 --> 00:04:13,790
好吧，看，不一定的，雷
Okay, Iook,
not necessariIy, Ray.

80
00:04:13,831 --> 00:04:15,750
也许咱们能让它苏醒
We may be abIe
to resuscitate him.

81
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:20,046
嘿，放微波炉里热热
Hey, Iet's toss him
in the microwave.

82
00:04:22,256 --> 00:04:25,218
好了，够了。
我来指挥行动
AII right, that's it.
I'm taking over this operation.

83
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:28,554
妈，去拿几条毛巾。
爸，我需要点冰。雷蒙德，冷却器
Ma, get me some toweIs.
Dad, I need some ice. Raymond, a cooIer.

84
00:04:28,596 --> 00:04:30,556
咱们送粗面包见兽医
We're evacuating
PumpernickeI to the vet.

85
00:04:30,598 --> 00:04:33,017
咱们走。走走走走
Let's go. Move move
move move move.

86
00:04:33,059 --> 00:04:36,354
罗伯特，兽医也不能让仓鼠
起死回生
Robert, the vet is not gonna
revive a hamster, okay?

87
00:04:36,354 --> 00:04:38,773
这不过是可替换的宠物
These are disposabIe pets.

88
00:04:38,773 --> 00:04:41,943
那你女儿的感受呢，雷？
那也是可替换的吗？
What about your daughter's feeIings,
Ray? Are those disposabIe?

89
00:04:41,984 --> 00:04:44,570
- 好吧
- 不，这不好
- AII right.
- No, it's not aII right!

90
00:04:44,612 --> 00:04:48,074
我碰巧关心一个小女孩。
等她知道她爸爸
I happen to care about a IittIe girI
whose heart is gonna break

91
00:04:48,116 --> 00:04:50,910
在可以的时候
没有尽力救她心爱的仓鼠，
if she finds out that her daddy
didn't do everything he couId

92
00:04:50,952 --> 00:04:53,621
她一定伤心死了
to save the Iife
of her precious hamster.

93
00:04:53,621 --> 00:04:56,874
该死的，雷蒙德，把冷却器拿来
Now damn it, Raymond,
get me that cooIer.

94
00:04:59,085 --> 00:05:01,421
嘿，雷，你忘了做冰块了
Hey, Ray, you forgot
to fiII the ice trays.

95
00:05:01,462 --> 00:05:03,714
直接和雪糕放一块好了
WeII, then we'II just
pack him with fudge pops.

96
00:05:03,756 --> 00:05:06,884
- 这些冻鱼片怎么样？
- 也一块放进来
- What about this box of fish sticks?
- Throw them in too.

97
00:05:06,926 --> 00:05:10,096
等黛比拉回来，
我会教她怎么做真的鱼
When Debra comes home,
I'II show her how to cook a reaI fish.

98
00:05:25,862 --> 00:05:29,532
黛比拉
Debra.

99
00:05:29,532 --> 00:05:32,076
弗兰克
Frank.

100
00:05:32,118 --> 00:05:33,578
起来
Get up.

101
00:05:33,619 --> 00:05:35,538
- 哈？
- 快点，这地方真是一团糟
- Huh?
- Come on, this pIace is a mess.

102
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,874
你什么都没干
You haven't done a thing.

103
00:05:37,915 --> 00:05:41,627
嘿，别打搅我。
我要歇会
Hey, Ieave me aIone.
I'm taking a break.

104
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:43,755
你干什么了？
What have you been doing?

105
00:05:45,506 --> 00:05:47,425
我把厨房整顿好了，
I not onIy straightened
out the kitchen,

106
00:05:47,467 --> 00:05:50,720
台子擦干净了，
冰箱也收拾完了
I scrubbed the countertops,
and I cIeaned out the freezer.

107
00:05:50,762 --> 00:05:52,972
然后你就开私酒庆祝了？
And you ceIebrate
with a bottIe of hooch?

108
00:05:53,014 --> 00:05:54,390
哦
Oh.

109
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:59,020
- 嘿，我们回来了
- 嗨，奶奶。嗨，爷爷
- Hey, we're home.
- Hi, Grandma. Hi, Grandpa.

110
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:01,397
- 嘿，甜心
- 弗兰克
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Frank.

111
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:04,233
嗨，甜心。
这不是我的
Hi, sweetheart.
This isn't mine.

112
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:06,986
这是妈咪的
This is Mommy's.

113
00:06:07,028 --> 00:06:09,197
- 玛丽，雷呢？
-雷蒙德得出去一趟，
- Marie, where's Ray?
- Raymond had to rush out,

114
00:06:09,238 --> 00:06:11,074
不过他很快就会回来了
but he shouId
be back soon.

115
00:06:11,115 --> 00:06:14,619
为什么我的客厅
像是兄弟会分坛
Why does my Iiving room
Iook Iike a frat house?

116
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,705
我没看出来有什么不一样
I didn't notice
any difference reaIIy.

117
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:21,667
- 嗨，爸爸！
- 哦，嘿嘿
- Hi, Daddy!
- Oh, hey hey.

118
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:23,795
嘿，小家伙们，你们回来了。嗨
Everybody, you're home. Hi.

119
00:06:23,836 --> 00:06:27,340
嘿。嗨，玩得开心吗？
哦天，想死你了
Hey. Hi, how was your visit?
Oh boy, I missed you.

120
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:30,384
你爸呢？他的膝盖……
怎么，他的膝盖……
How's your father? He's got a knee--
What, he have a knee--

121
00:06:30,426 --> 00:06:32,470
- 哦，他买了辆新车
- 雷。雷……
- oh, he got a new car.
- Ray. Ray...

122
00:06:38,101 --> 00:06:40,019
这里是怎么了？
What happened here?

123
00:06:40,061 --> 00:06:44,399
- 哦，没什么。怎么了？
- 这是什么？
- Oh, nothing. Why?
- What's that?

124
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,402
哦，哦，我们带粗面包兜风去了
Oh, oh, we gave
PumpernickeI a ride

125
00:06:47,443 --> 00:06:49,362
坐罗伯特的警车
in Robert's poIice car.

126
00:06:49,404 --> 00:06:52,949
是的是的。
它也喜欢这个
Yeah yeah.
He Iiked it, too.

127
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,910
一路都把脑袋伸出窗外
Rode the whoIe way
with his head out the window.

128
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:02,708
这不是粗面包
This isn't PumpernickeI.

129
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,211
爸爸，粗面包哪去了？
Daddy, where's PumpernickeI?

130
00:07:08,297 --> 00:07:10,466
呃蕖…
Um...

131
00:07:14,846 --> 00:07:17,473
呃蕖…
um--

132
00:07:17,515 --> 00:07:20,101
粗面包和冻鱼片睡一块了
PumpernickeI sIeeps
with the fish sticks.

133
00:07:33,197 --> 00:07:35,408
你知道，爱丽，
据我看来
You know, AIIy,
it's my understanding

134
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,786
冷冻几乎是安乐死了
that freezing is a virtuaIIy
painIess way to go.

135
00:07:42,707 --> 00:07:45,960
- 不像婚姻，那种痛苦……
- 弗兰克！
- UnIike marriage, where the pain is--
- Frank!

136
00:07:50,089 --> 00:07:52,884
我能看看粗面包吗？
Can I see PumpernickeI?

137
00:07:52,925 --> 00:07:54,635
- 爱丽，你不能
- 当然可以，亲爱的
- AIIy, you shouIdn't.
- Sure, honey.

138
00:07:54,677 --> 00:07:56,679
- 你可以过去看看它
- 什么？
- You can go see him.
- What?

139
00:07:56,721 --> 00:07:58,890
- 这对心理闭合很重要
It's important for cIosure.

140
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01,100
心理闭合
CIosure.

141
00:08:01,142 --> 00:08:03,102
又看书了？
Reading books again?

142
00:08:05,021 --> 00:08:08,608
为什么它身上全是冰淇淋？
Why is he covered
in chocoIate?

143
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,447
一定是雪糕化了
Some of the fudge pops
must have meIted.

144
00:08:14,489 --> 00:08:16,616
- 雪糕？
- 我要！我要！
- Fudge pops?
- Gimme! Gimme!

145
00:08:16,616 --> 00:08:18,910
- 不不，别过去！
- 不，孩子们，停下
- No no, get out of there!
- No, guys, stop that.

146
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,537
- 那不是雪糕
- 厨房里有饼干
- That's not fudge.
- There's cookies in the kitchen.

147
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:24,457
- 去去去快去
- 到这来，亲爱的
- Go go go go go go.
- Come here, sweetheart.

148
00:08:24,499 --> 00:08:27,001
重要的是，爱丽
The important thing
to know, AIIy,

149
00:08:27,043 --> 00:08:29,670
粗面包进天堂了
is that PumpernickeI
is in heaven.

150
00:08:29,712 --> 00:08:33,132
- 不是真的
- 弗兰克
- Not reaIIy.
- Frank.

151
00:08:33,174 --> 00:08:35,093
不是真的天堂，
不是人的天堂
Not reaI heaven,
not peopIe heaven.

152
00:08:35,134 --> 00:08:37,637
- 只有一个天堂
- 告诉你点信息吧，
- There's onIy one heaven.
- For your information,

153
00:08:37,678 --> 00:08:39,806
动物有单独的天堂
there's a whoIe separate
heaven for animaIs.

154
00:08:39,847 --> 00:08:43,726
- 你上哪知道的？
- 圣经上写的
- And just where did you Iearn that?
- It's in the BibIe.

155
00:08:43,768 --> 00:08:47,814
- 好想你看过圣经似的
- 我看过各种该死的圣经
- Like you read the BibIe.
- I've read pIenty of damn BibIes.

156
00:08:55,071 --> 00:08:57,698
所有的动物都能进天堂吗，
还是只有宠物？
Do aII animaIs go
to heaven or just pets?

157
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,660
所有的动物都跟咱们上人的天堂
AII animaIs go
to peopIe heaven with us, dear.

158
00:09:00,701 --> 00:09:02,745
人的天堂是人的
PeopIe heaven's
for peopIe.

159
00:09:02,787 --> 00:09:05,706
你奶奶喝醉了
Your grandma's
been hitting the sauce.

160
00:09:08,501 --> 00:09:10,253
好吧
AII right.

161
00:09:10,294 --> 00:09:12,880
谢谢。
谢谢你的正解
Thank you.
Thanks for cIearing that up.

162
00:09:12,922 --> 00:09:14,841
动物是不是也有下地狱的？
Do some animaIs
go to heII?

163
00:09:14,882 --> 00:09:17,051
我们不用这样的字眼，爱丽
We don't use
those words, AIIy.

164
00:09:17,093 --> 00:09:19,345
坏动物下地狱，孩子
Bad animaIs
go to heII, kid.

165
00:09:21,097 --> 00:09:24,434
相信我，我知道
BeIieve you me,
I know.

166
00:09:24,475 --> 00:09:26,060
我在你这年纪，
When I was your age,

167
00:09:26,102 --> 00:09:28,855
有一个叫艾尔沙的恶毒的德国牧羊人
there was this mean
oId German shepherd named EIsa.

168
00:09:28,896 --> 00:09:30,940
有一天我走路上学
I was waIking
to schooI one day

169
00:09:30,982 --> 00:09:33,401
我准是经过的时候
太靠近她的领地了
and I must have crossed
too cIose to her territory.

170
00:09:33,443 --> 00:09:36,904
那年头，德国人
对领地很敏感
In those days, the Germans were
very sensitive about their territory.

171
00:09:43,703 --> 00:09:45,830
这理由就足够
WeII, that's aII it took

172
00:09:45,872 --> 00:09:47,915
让纳粹母狼艾尔沙寡妇
for FrauIein EIsa
the Nazi she-woIf

173
00:09:47,957 --> 00:09:50,168
跳将出来，
从我的纯美国皮下
to jump out
and take a hunk out

174
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:53,629
咬下一大块肉
of my aII-American hide.

175
00:09:53,671 --> 00:09:56,090
伤疤现在还在
I stiII have the scar.

176
00:09:56,132 --> 00:09:59,010
- 想看看吗？我让你们看看
- 不，弗兰克
- You want to see it? I'II show you.
- No, Frank!

177
00:09:59,051 --> 00:10:00,970
你干什么？
坐下
What are you doing?
Sit down.

178
00:10:01,012 --> 00:10:03,681
好吧！
AII right!

179
00:10:03,723 --> 00:10:07,351
我想说的是，艾尔沙寡妇
这会很可能就在地狱
The point is FrauIein EIsa's probabIy
in heII right now

180
00:10:07,393 --> 00:10:10,229
拖着她的纳粹屁股
从魔鬼的地毯上过
dragging her Nazi butt
across the deviI's carpet.

181
00:10:18,571 --> 00:10:22,700
谢谢这么感人的故事
Thank you for that
heartwarming story.

182
00:10:22,742 --> 00:10:26,287
看，爱丽，我很抱歉
发生这种事，
Look, AIIy, I'm very sorry
that this happened,

183
00:10:26,287 --> 00:10:30,958
现在来见见你的全新的仓鼠
but now it's time to meet
your brand-new hamster.

184
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,169
- 不，谢谢
- 哦，别这样，看，看哪
- No, thanks.
- Oh, come on, Iook Iook.

185
00:10:33,211 --> 00:10:35,630
它看起来和原来的粗面包
没两样
He Iooks just Iike
the oId PumpernickeI.

186
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:37,590
宠物店的人说，
And the guy at
the store toId me

187
00:10:37,632 --> 00:10:41,719
再过几年，
没准它能飞起来
that in a coupIe years,
he might fIy.

188
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:44,472
雷！
Ray!

189
00:10:44,472 --> 00:10:47,016
雷，别跟她那么说
Ray, don't teII her that.

190
00:10:47,058 --> 00:10:49,310
好吧
AII right.

191
00:10:49,352 --> 00:10:51,604
好吧，它不会……
它不会飞
AII right, so he won't--
he's not gonna fIy.

192
00:10:51,646 --> 00:10:55,441
不过他真的说了
它有魔力
But he did say
that he's magicaI.

193
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,987
- 雷
- 它的个性！
- Ray.
- His personaIity!

194
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:03,866
- 不，爸爸
- 哦，别这样，爱丽
- No, Dad.
- Oh, come on, AIIy.

195
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:06,244
看看它。
它是个可爱的小替代
Just take a Iook.
He's a cute IittIe repIacement.

196
00:11:06,285 --> 00:11:09,038
我不想要替代，爸爸
I don't want
a repIacement, Daddy.

197
00:11:12,834 --> 00:11:15,795
我想这正是她需要的――
一个替代的父亲
I think that's exactIy what she needs--
a repIacement daddy.

198
00:11:25,054 --> 00:11:27,807
你能回去吗，求你了？
CouId you go home, pIease?

199
00:11:27,807 --> 00:11:30,518
把这两个神学家一并带走
And take these two
theoIogians with you.

200
00:11:38,651 --> 00:11:40,194
你不理解，亲爱的
You don't understand,
sweetie.

201
00:11:40,236 --> 00:11:42,029
一个孩子的宠物死的时候，
When a chiId's pet dies,

202
00:11:42,071 --> 00:11:45,074
在能够接受别的宠物之前，
she has to go through
a grieving process

203
00:11:45,116 --> 00:11:46,993
她必定会经历哀悼的过程
before she can
take on a new pet.

204
00:11:47,034 --> 00:11:49,996
好了，你能看书。
我们知道了
AII right, you can read.
We get it.

205
00:11:52,915 --> 00:11:55,418
为这种事大做文章
是不是有病啊？
Isn't it a IittIe morbid
to make such a big deaI out of this?

206
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,545
不，这不是有病。
这是现实
No, it's not morbid.
It's reaIity.

207
00:11:57,587 --> 00:11:59,505
哦，得了吧。
就是只仓鼠
Oh, come on.
It's a hamster.

208
00:11:59,547 --> 00:12:01,674
由她去吧，
她会好的
Just Ieave her aIone,
and she'II get over it.

209
00:12:01,716 --> 00:12:03,843
你知道怎样对所有孩子
的健康都有好处？
You know what I think
wouId be heaIthy for aII the kids?

210
00:12:03,885 --> 00:12:07,472
如果咱们能为粗面包举行
正式的告别仪式
If we have sort of a formaI
goodbye ceremony for PumpernickeI.

211
00:12:07,513 --> 00:12:10,183
- 好主意，黛比
- 雷可以在后院挖个洞
- Good idea, Deb.
- Ray can dig a hoIe in the backyard.

212
00:12:10,224 --> 00:12:12,852
- 我才不挖洞
- 你要挖的
- I'm not digging a hoIe.
- You're digging a hoIe.

213
00:12:12,894 --> 00:12:15,938
- 我去拿个鞋盒
- 好，我去摆点奶酪、冷荤
- I wiII get a shoebox.
- Okay, I'II put out the coId cuts.

214
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,482
好的
Okay.

215
00:12:17,523 --> 00:12:19,859
我去拿啤酒
I'II get some beer.

216
00:12:21,235 --> 00:12:23,988
好了，咱们来举行葬礼
AII right,
Iet's put on a funeraI.

217
00:12:34,165 --> 00:12:37,293
嘿
Hey.

218
00:12:37,335 --> 00:12:39,212
怎么样了？
How's it going?

219
00:12:39,253 --> 00:12:41,214
我在暴风雨里挖石头
I'm digging through soIid
rock in a rainstorm.

220
00:12:41,255 --> 00:12:43,341
你想会怎么样？
How do you think
it's going?

221
00:12:43,382 --> 00:12:46,844
你是什么，糖做的？
叫毛毛雨都勉强
What are you, made of sugar?
It's bareIy drizzIing.

222
00:12:50,807 --> 00:12:52,975
啊！
Ah!

223
00:12:53,017 --> 00:12:54,977
小心点，亲爱的
CarefuI, honey.

224
00:12:57,146 --> 00:12:59,649
你怎么不来挖？
再怎么说这都是你的错
Why don't you dig this hoIe?
This is aII your fauIt anyway.

225
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,360
你该告诉我笼子坏了一块的
You shouId have toId me about
that broken piece on the hamster cage.

226
00:13:02,402 --> 00:13:04,320
嘿，你要是稍微用点心，
Hey, if you were
a IittIe more invoIved,

227
00:13:04,362 --> 00:13:06,406
你就会注意到这些细节的
you'd pick up
on these detaiIs.

228
00:13:06,447 --> 00:13:08,408
- 哦，是吗？
- 是的
- Oh, reaIIy?
- Yeah.

229
00:13:08,408 --> 00:13:10,827
也许我该把坑挖大点
Maybe I make this hoIe
a IittIe bigger.

230
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:23,798
哦，拜托，爸
Oh, come on, Dad.

231
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,217
又是这个金属探测器？
你干什么呢？
Again with the metaI detector?
What are you doing?

232
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:28,511
你妈就要过生日了
Your mother's
birthday's coming up.

233
00:13:31,055 --> 00:13:34,308
聪明，这除了你爸就是石头
Yeah, weII, there's nothing
here but dirt and rocks.

234
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,769
这比他去年送我的好多了
That's better than what
he got me Iast year.

235
00:13:39,188 --> 00:13:42,608
好了，爱丽，咱们把盒子放进去，
然后给它盖上土
AII right, AIIy, we'II put the box in,
and then I'II put the dirt on him.

236
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:46,362
等等，我想每个人先对
粗面包说段话
Wait. I want everybody to say
something about PumpernickeI first.

237
00:13:46,404 --> 00:13:47,989
哦，好极了，好的
Oh, that's good, yeah.

238
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,199
然后咱们都给它撒上一把土
Then we'II aII take
a handfuI of dirt and toss it in.

239
00:13:50,241 --> 00:13:52,410
- 你干什么？
- 这是她的愿望
- What are you doing?
- That's what she wants.

240
00:13:52,452 --> 00:13:54,287
在下雨呢，亲爱的
It's raining, honey.

241
00:13:54,287 --> 00:13:57,373
我想咱们应该按爱丽的方式做。
你想上我伞下来吗？
I think we shouId do this AIIy's way.
You wanna get under my umbreIIa?

242
00:13:57,415 --> 00:14:00,334
我在我现在的地方很好，
非常感谢
I'm wonderfuI right where
I am, thank you very much.

243
00:14:01,836 --> 00:14:04,213
爸爸，你想开始吗？
Daddy, wouId you
Iike to start?

244
00:14:04,255 --> 00:14:06,132
哦，我不知道
Oh, I don't know.

245
00:14:06,174 --> 00:14:08,384
亲爱的，为什么不让爷爷先来呢？
说吧
Honey, why don't we Iet
Grandpa start? Go ahead.

246
00:14:08,384 --> 00:14:09,927
爷爷
Grandpa.

247
00:14:09,969 --> 00:14:13,681
爸，你先别探了好吗？
Dad, couId you power
down for a second?

248
00:14:13,723 --> 00:14:15,183
哈？
Huh?

249
00:14:15,224 --> 00:14:16,809
噢噢噢噢
Oh oh oh oh.

250
00:14:16,851 --> 00:14:19,687
好的好的。
呃……
AII right, aII right.
Uh...

251
00:14:19,729 --> 00:14:21,856
粗面包
PumpernickeI--

252
00:14:21,898 --> 00:14:24,650
就像仓鼠，喜欢面包
Iiked the hamster,
Iove the bread.

253
00:14:24,692 --> 00:14:28,154
下一个
Next.

254
00:14:28,196 --> 00:14:29,572
奶奶
Grandma.

255
00:14:29,614 --> 00:14:31,699
好的，亲爱的
Okay, dear.

256
00:14:31,741 --> 00:14:35,369
虽然粗面包离开了人世间，
Even though PumpernickeI
has gone from this earth,

257
00:14:35,411 --> 00:14:38,706
我知道它会永远从天堂看着咱们
I know he'II aIways
be Iooking down at us from heaven.

258
00:14:38,748 --> 00:14:41,417
人的天堂
PeopIe heaven.

259
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,336
好了，继续，罗伯特叔叔
AII right, go ahead,
UncIe Robert.

260
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:50,009
死亡……
Death--

261
00:14:55,348 --> 00:14:57,475
最后的再见
the finaI goodbye.

262
00:14:59,018 --> 00:15:02,855
终极的道别
The uItimate toodIe-oo.

263
00:15:02,897 --> 00:15:05,900
或许，死亡不是尽头
Or maybe death
is not the end.

264
00:15:05,942 --> 00:15:08,069
也许它是个起点
Maybe it's a beginning.

265
00:15:08,111 --> 00:15:11,697
也许，它是终极的问好
Perhaps, it's
the uItimate howdy-do.

266
00:15:11,697 --> 00:15:13,533
你搞笑呢？
你搞笑吧？
Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me?

267
00:15:13,574 --> 00:15:15,952
怎么了，雷？
对你太深刻了？
What's the matter, Ray,
too deep for you?

268
00:15:15,952 --> 00:15:18,454
哦，天
Oh, God.

269
00:15:18,496 --> 00:15:21,124
继续，罗伯特
Go ahead, Robert.

270
00:15:21,165 --> 00:15:23,167
你知道，我想明白了，
You know, I have come
to the concIusion that

271
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:26,838
我死的时候，我愿意像
粗面包那样死去
when I die, I wouId Iike
to die Iike PumpernickeI,

272
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:29,465
平静、没有痛苦，
quietIy, painIessIy,

273
00:15:29,507 --> 00:15:32,593
嘴角还沾着巧克力雪糕
chocoIate fudge pop stuck
to the corner of my mouth.

274
00:15:34,387 --> 00:15:38,683
因为那样，我的朋友，
一定是个幸福的死法
For that, my friends,
must be a happy death.

275
00:15:42,186 --> 00:15:44,105
Aloha（夏威夷语）
AIoha,

276
00:15:44,147 --> 00:15:47,817
意思是再见和你好
which means goodbye
and heIIo.

277
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:51,904
- 好吧
- Shalom（希伯来语）也是一样的意思
- AII right.
- Same with shaIom.

278
00:15:51,946 --> 00:15:54,907
- 闭嘴。只许说一个意思的
- 好了，雷
- Shut up. One meaning.
- AII right, Ray.

279
00:15:58,619 --> 00:16:00,538
该你了，妈咪
Your turn, Mommy.

280
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,331
好的，
Okay, weII,

281
00:16:02,373 --> 00:16:05,001
我一直感觉和粗面包很亲近，
I've aIways feIt
very cIose to PumpernickeI,

282
00:16:05,042 --> 00:16:09,213
特别是，
我喂它吃的，打扫洗澡
especiaIIy since I did
a Iot of the feeding and cIeaning

283
00:16:09,255 --> 00:16:12,258
你知道，大部分的活
and, you know,
most of the work.

284
00:16:14,177 --> 00:16:18,473
所以粗面包的离去
会在我生活里留下一个大空洞
So PumpernickeI's passing
is gonna Ieave a big hoIe in my Iife.

285
00:16:18,514 --> 00:16:21,851
我都不知道怎么打发那些时间了
Can't imagine what
I'II do with the time.

286
00:16:24,312 --> 00:16:26,814
再见，粗面包
So Iong, PumpernickeI.

287
00:16:29,275 --> 00:16:31,736
- 麦克
- 爱丽，为什么
- MichaeI.
- AIIy, why don't we do

288
00:16:31,778 --> 00:16:33,321
不把双胞胎当背景人物呢？
the twins as a set, okay?

289
00:16:33,362 --> 00:16:36,824
- 雷――雷，上我伞下面来
- 在下雨
- Ray-- Ray, come under my umbreIIa.
- 'Cause it's raining.

290
00:16:36,866 --> 00:16:39,368
嘿，别说话――
仓鼠葬礼
Hey, no taIking--
hamster funeraI.

291
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:44,248
我回想你的，粗面包
I'II miss you,
PumpernickeI.

292
00:16:47,085 --> 00:16:50,797
- 杰弗里
- 我也会想你的，粗面包
- Jeffrey.
- I'II miss you too, PumpernickeI.

293
00:16:54,592 --> 00:16:57,345
轮我了
Now my turn.

294
00:16:57,386 --> 00:17:00,056
我也回想你的，粗面包
I'II miss you too,
PumpernickeI.

295
00:17:00,098 --> 00:17:03,017
你曾是我最好的朋友，
现在也是
You were my best friend,
and you stiII are.

296
00:17:04,727 --> 00:17:06,687
别担心，粗面包
Don't worry, PumpernickeI.

297
00:17:06,729 --> 00:17:09,565
你会永远和我在一起，
因为我永远不会忘记你的
You'II aIways be with me,
'cause I'II never forget you.

298
00:17:19,409 --> 00:17:21,953
该你了，爸爸
Your turn, Daddy.

299
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:28,376
呃……
Uh...

300
00:17:28,376 --> 00:17:30,336
嗯……
um...

301
00:17:32,296 --> 00:17:34,924
我没有太多的接触……|
I didn't have much
contact with--

302
00:17:37,343 --> 00:17:39,804
我不是太认识粗面包
I didn't know
PumpernickeI very weII.

303
00:17:39,846 --> 00:17:42,515
我记得唯一一件事是
The onIy thing
I remember is

304
00:17:42,557 --> 00:17:44,517
我们把它从宠物店带回来的时候，
when we brought him back
from the pet store,

305
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,644
爱丽想让我抱抱它，
and AIIy wanted me
to hoId him,

306
00:17:46,686 --> 00:17:48,604
所以我一把抓住它
so I reached out
to grab him

307
00:17:48,646 --> 00:17:51,524
然后它咬了我手指头
and he bit me
on the finger.

308
00:17:51,524 --> 00:17:53,317
很疼
And it hurt.

309
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:55,945
然后爸爸说了不好的话
So Daddy said
a bad word.

310
00:18:02,285 --> 00:18:05,037
可是爱丽拿起……
But AIIy picked up the--

311
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:08,166
粗面包
然后教我……
PumpernickeI
and she showed me--

312
00:18:08,207 --> 00:18:10,126
叫我怎么抱它
showed me how
to hoId him.

313
00:18:10,168 --> 00:18:11,961
像这样
Like this.

314
00:18:12,003 --> 00:18:13,379
对吗？
Right?

315
00:18:19,802 --> 00:18:21,846
我从没注意到你长那么大了，
I never noticed
untiI just now

316
00:18:21,888 --> 00:18:24,015
直到刚才
how grown-up you are.

317
00:18:25,391 --> 00:18:27,393
你和你朋友在一起的样子，
The way you were
with your friend,

318
00:18:27,435 --> 00:18:29,228
你刚刚说的话
and what you said
just now,

319
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,772
你真的……
you reaIIy--

320
00:18:32,857 --> 00:18:35,735
真的看来长大了
reaIIy seem grown-up.

321
00:18:35,777 --> 00:18:37,695
我真为你骄傲
I'm proud of you.

322
00:18:47,371 --> 00:18:49,874
该死的仓鼠！
Damn hamster!

323
00:18:56,672 --> 00:18:59,258
爸爸？
Daddy?

324
00:19:00,927 --> 00:19:03,596
明天能给我们买兔子吗？
Can we get
a rabbit tomorrow?

325
00:19:05,348 --> 00:19:07,475
似的，孩子们，
随便你们想要什么
Yeah, guys,
whatever you want.

326
00:19:07,517 --> 00:19:10,812
- 耶！
- 酷！兔子！呜！
- Yeah!
- CooI! A rabbit! Whoo!

327
00:19:10,853 --> 00:19:14,065
呀呼！耶！
Yahoo! Yeah!

328
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:18,611
兔子。
坑还要大
Rabbit.
That's a bigger hoIe.

329
00:19:34,251 --> 00:19:36,837
你们都笑我，哈？
You aII Iaughed at me, huh?

330
00:19:36,878 --> 00:19:39,631
浪费时间，哈？
Big waste of time, huh?

331
00:19:42,217 --> 00:19:43,969
哈？！
Huh?!

332
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:48,682
我这就给自己买罐Yoo-hoo
I think I'II buy
myseIf a Yoo-hoo.

333
00:19:52,686 --> 00:19:55,230
我的生日礼物就这么完了
There goes
my birthday present.
