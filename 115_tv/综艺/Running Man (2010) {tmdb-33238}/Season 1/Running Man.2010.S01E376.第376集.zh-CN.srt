Crane, thanks for squeezing me in.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You said 4:30.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hell, is it only 4:30?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Sorry about that.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Listen, I’ll be brief, since it appears I’m on my Way out.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I’ve received a lot of unsolicited phone calls.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Simply put, the customers are satisfied,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and so is the accounting department. Keep up the good Work.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I’m not doing it on my own.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That's true, isn't it?

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Why don't We get those secretaries back to their regular jobs?

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It’s just Joan Holloway, actually.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So her attentions are divided at best.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Make it a full-time position, 1 50 a Week,

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and he has to share an office.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Sounds perfect.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
