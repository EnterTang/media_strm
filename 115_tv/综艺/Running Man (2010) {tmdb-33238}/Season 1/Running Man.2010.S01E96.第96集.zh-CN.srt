Are you seriously going to be doing
Running Man with us?

13
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:03,505
Yes, that's right.

14
00:01:03,506 --> 00:01:05,935
-Have you ever watched our program?
-Yes.  I watch it often.

15
00:01:05,936 --> 00:01:12,169
I know you must be really busy during season,
do you have the time to watch TV?

16
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,641
Yes.  We have lots of time to watch it.

17
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:16,814
He's so honest.  So honest...!

18
00:01:16,814 --> 00:01:20,209
He was so honest about it,
that I got flustered!

19
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:24,200
By any chance, does Coach Ferguson...?
[Is the coach of Manchester United also a viewer?]

20
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,765
What are you talking about right now?

21
00:01:25,766 --> 00:01:29,105
Maybe Coach Ferguson catches what
Park Ji Sung is watching..

22
00:01:29,106 --> 00:01:31,995
-And he could ask..
-What is this?

23
00:01:32,584 --> 00:01:34,342
This is Gary!

24
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:39,001
I don't know about the coach...
but Abram watches it.

25
00:01:39,003 --> 00:01:41,736
He watches it!

26
00:01:41,736 --> 00:01:45,058
Abram!  Abram watches it!

27
00:01:45,637 --> 00:01:48,706
-Who knew that he'd be watching us?
This is truly an honor.

28
00:01:48,707 --> 00:01:51,542
Abram... wow!
Is it fun?

29
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:54,924
[Scared? No, it's fun!]

30
00:01:57,555 --> 00:01:59,951
What are you talking about?

31
00:01:59,951 --> 00:02:04,987
Are you going to be okay if we tear off your
name tag and stuff while doing this with us?

32
00:02:04,987 --> 00:02:07,066
Yes.  I'm confident that I won't get caught.

33
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:10,901
I'm begging you, but please tear it off
of Jong Kook's back once.

34
00:02:10,924 --> 00:02:13,250
Jong Kook is just impossible for us!

35
00:02:13,251 --> 00:02:16,352
If you win the race
playing against Park Ji Sung,

36
00:02:16,353 --> 00:02:18,893
You'll win an invitation to
Asiana Dream Cup,

37
00:02:18,894 --> 00:02:22,055

Park Ji sung on the field.

00:02:42,411 --> 00:02:45,191
-Using the psychic powers...
-Yes.  The man who controls the time...?

45
00:02:45,603 --> 00:02:47,231
Do you know death note?
My death note?

46
00:02:48,323 --> 00:02:52,538
Death note...
Wasn't it picked as the least popular?

47
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:56,519
[Out of all the member's powers,
Kwang Soo's voted the least desirable]

48
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,865

Now there is one more guest
that will be joining you today.

54
00:03:18,727 --> 00:03:20,271
You're saying there's another guest?!

55
00:03:20,955 --> 00:03:24,359
-Someone else is coming?  Who's coming?
-Come on out!!

56
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,959
Who is it?  Please come out!

[The nation's little sister,
and the worldwide soccer star meet]

60
00:03:52,837 --> 00:03:54,567
Is Ji Hyo that lacking?

61
00:03:55,974 --> 00:03:58,770
Park Ji Sung all of a sudden
seems very embarrassed.

62
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:00,418
Why are you standing so far apart?

63
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:03,295
-Why are you being like that all of a sudden?
-Yeah.  Go stand next to her.

64
00:04:05,385 --> 00:04:07,966
What's it like to see Park Ji Sung, IU?

65
00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:09,512
It's so amazing!

66
00:04:10,837 --> 00:04:12,258
It's like that for us too.

67
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:14,612
We're just pretending not to be like that.
[In truth, members of Running Man agree]

68
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:17,578
Now we're going to start the psychic soccer.

69
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,473
With the exception of Park Ji Sung,
everyone else will have 1 psychic power.

70
00:04:21,475 --> 00:04:22,978
Why aren't you giving me one?

71
00:04:24,052 --> 00:04:26,567
Park Ji Sung is asking
why you're not giving him one.

72
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:27,921
What is it that you want to have?

73
00:04:27,923 --> 00:04:29,259
-A psychic power?
-Yes.

74
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:31,122
The power to dominate space.

75
00:04:34,915 --> 00:04:36,531
That's my power.

76
00:04:37,494 --> 00:04:38,846
Why don't you try shouting out
domination of balls?

77
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:40,666
Do you know how embarrassing it is?

78
00:04:40,668 --> 00:04:42,723
[Even though it may be nice,
it's probably very embarrassing to shout out]

79
00:04:45,288 --> 00:04:49,129
[It's actually very embarrassing to
shout it out in front of people]

80
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,548
-When I say mine...
-Show me.  Show me how you do it.

81
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,641
You have to do it with charisma...

82
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:56,593
Pull it up like this, and raise it...
That's right.

83
00:04:58,096 --> 00:05:00,916
Dominate the space...

84
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:02,812
You have to finish it!

85
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:04,047
[Trying to do it seriously and
finds it embarrassing]

86
00:05:04,048 --> 00:05:05,959
-You have to finish it!
-Oh, I'm so embarrassed!

87
00:05:10,771 --> 00:05:14,103
Okay.  I'll give it another try.
[Demonstrating again with gritted teeth]

88
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:18,837
[The man who dominates space!]

89
00:05:19,562 --> 00:05:21,990
[If done properly, the effect is visible]

90
00:05:22,262 --> 00:05:24,588
-Why don't you give it a try, Park Ji Sung?
-Like this?

91
00:05:24,588 --> 00:05:26,300
I just have to do it like this, right?

92
00:05:27,887 --> 00:05:30,605
The man who dominates space!

93
00:05:32,226 --> 00:05:34,423
The man who dominates space!

94
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,127
That's not very cool!

95
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:44,403
You were very serious about it!
[The aftermath of embarrassment]

96
00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:47,305
If you can get a psychic power,
what would you like to have?

97
00:05:47,307 --> 00:05:48,955
-I'd want the death note.
-Why?

98
00:05:48,956 --> 00:05:50,146
Who would you kill off?

99
00:05:50,148 --> 00:05:54,515
-If we're playing soccer...
-Yes, you can kick them off.

100
00:05:54,516 --> 00:06:01,513
Then Park Ji Sung...
[With the death note, Park Ji Sung...?]

101
00:06:01,514 --> 00:06:03,548
You're saying you're going to kill me off?!

102
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,021
You can't do that!

103
00:06:06,023 --> 00:06:09,298
I'm saying if he was on the opposing team.
Only if he's on the other team.

104
00:06:09,298 --> 00:06:10,814
She's scary...

105
00:06:11,627 --> 00:06:14,323
[Wait for it!]
[Scary Girl, IU's surprising action!]

106
00:06:14,324 --> 00:06:16,388
First.  There will need to be 2 teams.

107
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:18,213
I'll announce the captain for each team.

108
00:06:18,214 --> 00:06:21,549
-For 1 team, without a doubt...
-It's Park Ji Sung.

109
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,005
[One of the teams' captain is Park Ji Sung]

110
00:06:24,334 --> 00:06:26,211
The captain for the other team is...

111
00:06:26,435 --> 00:06:28,875
-Kim Jong Kook.
-I knew it!

112
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:31,140
Why are you doing that?!

113
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:34,257
Only one of the Running Man members
can go on Park Ji Sung's team.

114
00:06:34,257 --> 00:06:36,024
-I'll go.
-Come on...

115
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,885
I can just go! Me!

116
00:06:40,565 --> 00:06:41,810
I think we can make a go of it.

117
00:06:41,812 --> 00:06:43,531
-You'll be okay, right, Park Ji Sung?
-No, that's not okay.

118
00:06:45,577 --> 00:06:48,399
You're even giving them psychic powers...

119
00:06:48,401 --> 00:06:50,638
[2-member Park Ji Sung's team vs.
7-member Running Man's team]

120
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,338
Park Ji Sung will start to tear off the name
tag from members he doesn't want on his team.

121
00:06:59,158 --> 00:07:00,932
Is there anyone specific that you want?

122
00:07:01,665 --> 00:07:03,002
No, not a single one of them.

123
00:07:03,913 --> 00:07:05,978
I can just go behind them and tear it off?

124
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:17,908
I'm really looking forward to today.

125
00:07:21,423 --> 00:07:23,613
[Yes, you can look forward to it]

126
00:07:24,266 --> 00:07:27,274
[First off, Suk Jin is eliminated
from Ji Sung's team]

127
00:07:28,853 --> 00:07:32,425
Now the game can start for the day!

128
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:37,435
He ripped it off without even hesitating!

129
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:40,948
He rips it off with such delight.

130
00:07:41,846 --> 00:07:44,634
[First Suk Jin goes off to Jong Kook's team]
[Who's next to be eliminated?]

131

[Ji Sung's ripped off one person's tag,
Ji Suk Jin's...]

132

-Ji Suk Jin's...
[In the middle of his speech...!]

133
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:59,322
This time too, he tears it off
in such an entertaining way!]

134
00:07:59,654 --> 00:08:01,075
That's awesome!

135
00:08:02,475 --> 00:08:05,689
Park Ji Sung... Do you not have any intentions
of coming on the show often from now on?

136
00:08:05,975 --> 00:08:09,600
[Even the nation's most famous MC lusts for
Park Ji Sung's appearance on his show]

137
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,745
-Isn't his timing the best?
-His timing is an art form.

138
00:08:11,745 --> 00:08:16,750
That's awesome... Seriously...
[Then who's the 3rd to be eliminated?]

139
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,746
-I was expecting it...
-I'm sure you were expecting it.

140
00:08:18,747 --> 00:08:20,957
It would've been fun.
I feel a little saddened by it.

141
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,170
-I'm seriously nervous!
-My heart is pounding!

142

-My heart is racing!
-I'm sorry...

143

-I'm sorry.
-Song Ji Hyo! Come over here.

144
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:38,256
You think you'd be picked
when IU is standing next to you?

145
00:08:38,511 --> 00:08:41,746
[A sudden surprise
during a brief moment of reprieve]

146
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:48,191
Come here.

147
00:08:48,822 --> 00:08:51,992
My heart really hurt...
I feel like I've just been dumped.

148
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,616
You feel like you've been dumped?

149
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:57,475
[Not being on the same team with Ji Sung
makes it feel like one's been broken up with]

150
00:08:57,719 --> 00:08:59,555
I wonder who's it's going to be?

[Only ones that are left.
IU-Kwang Soo-Gary.  3 people!]

01:19:39,774 --> 01:19:43,734
Park Ji Sung, fighting!
[The final round]

1196
01:19:51,163 --> 01:19:56,091
[Huh?  Park Ji Sung's team being pulled?]

1197
01:20:09,368 --> 01:20:12,085
[Song Ji Hyo's team wins!]

1198
01:20:16,002 --> 01:20:18,157
It's okay.  We were just out of sync.

1199
01:20:20,207 --> 01:20:23,695
-Let's win this.  Let's win!
-This is no joke!

1200
01:20:25,113 --> 01:20:28,327
[Now the final round]

1201
01:20:30,224 --> 01:20:33,257
We're just going to go with
the members we have to the end.

1202
01:20:33,257 --> 01:20:34,630
That's cool.

1203
01:20:34,631 --> 01:20:37,471
She's struggling so much at the end
with her high heels.

1204
01:20:37,472 --> 01:20:39,777
[The female student struggling
in her high heels]

1205
01:20:40,789 --> 01:20:44,855
-We're all having a hard time right now.
-Your face is full of sweat right now!

1206
01:20:47,417 --> 01:20:50,083
Let's all cheer on Park Ji Sung!

1207
01:20:50,085 --> 01:20:56,886
When Park Ji Sung started huffing with them
pulling so hard, I was flustered!

1208
01:20:56,887 --> 01:20:58,971
[An unbelievable scene seeing
Park Ji Sung being winded]

1209

1210
01:21:04,774 --> 01:21:06,025
[Fighting!  Park Ji Sung!]

1211
01:21:07,390 --> 01:21:10,457
Everyone!  Now is the final round!

1212
01:21:10,458 --> 01:21:14,170
Let's all give a round of applause
for the both teams!!

1213

[The round that determines the winner!]

1214
01:21:18,921 --> 01:21:22,554
Pil-Chok-Cross!

1215
01:21:23,243 --> 01:21:24,847
We can do this..!

1216
01:21:27,355 --> 01:21:28,974
Start pulling right away.

1217
01:21:29,623 --> 01:21:31,688
Heave, heave.  Heave...!

1218
01:21:35,752 --> 01:21:38,715
-It's going too far to that side!
-It's not on our side.

1219
01:21:44,907 --> 01:21:49,007
[Who will the winning go to?]

1220
01:21:50,298 --> 01:21:53,480
[Captain Park pulling with gritted teeth]

1221
01:21:55,198 --> 01:21:59,826
[Power of Ji Hyo's upgraded team]

1222

[Park Ji Sung's team in danger!]

1223
01:22:09,278 --> 01:22:13,784
[Is this how Ji Hyo's team will win?]

1224
01:22:19,042 --> 01:22:25,339
[The awakening of Jae Suk-Mr. Capable...
And Captain Park!]

1225
01:22:26,228 --> 01:22:33,065
[How will this game end?]

1226
01:22:36,565 --> 01:22:42,255
Park Ji Sung, Park Ji Sung...

1227
01:22:42,256 --> 01:22:45,326
[The students' last cheer!]

1228
01:22:47,595 --> 01:22:51,509
[And the game that still won't end!]

1229
01:22:53,739 --> 01:22:57,371
[Slowly pulling the rope back!]

1230
01:22:57,891 --> 01:23:05,029
[But then... A reversal?]

1231
01:23:10,975 --> 01:23:14,652
[Park Ji Sung's team... Wins!]

1232
01:23:16,168 --> 01:23:19,568
[A historical show
right in front of their eyes!]

1233
01:23:27,453 --> 01:23:30,663
[Ji Hyo's team that did their best to the end]

1234
01:23:35,796 --> 01:23:37,445
Did you exert yourself too much?

1235
01:23:37,447 --> 01:23:40,515
Our Captain Park is exhausted!

1236
01:23:40,515 --> 01:23:41,866
[More exhausting than a soccer game]

1237
01:23:41,868 --> 01:23:43,516
How was the tug of war?

1238
01:23:44,409 --> 01:23:47,206
I'm reminded of the most difficult time
during my soccer career!

1239
01:23:47,988 --> 01:23:51,588
Because it was the most difficult...

1240
01:23:51,588 --> 01:23:55,207
[Park Ji Sung's team takes the
first prize winnings]

1241
01:23:56,679 --> 01:24:01,449
I'm sure now it's time to put this case down,
and start the race... Right?

1242
01:24:01,762 --> 01:24:05,573
It doesn't matter what place we have
at this point...

1243
01:24:05,573 --> 01:24:07,889
That's right.
Ultimately, it's all about the end.

1244
01:24:07,890 --> 01:24:10,346
-It's like a bag of sand right now.
-That's right.

1245
01:24:12,408 --> 01:24:15,296
I want to be cautious when I ask this...

1246
01:24:15,296 --> 01:24:20,050
But... You're not...
A spy or something, right?

1247
01:24:20,425 --> 01:24:22,421
You're not a spy, right?

1248
01:24:22,421 --> 01:24:24,771
[All of a sudden, suspecting him as a spy?]

1249
01:24:25,990 --> 01:24:31,393
Well... It's just that...
There's money riding on it and everything...

1250
01:24:31,394 --> 01:24:32,686
It's not like that, right?

1251
01:24:32,688 --> 01:24:35,353
Do you think that I can be a spy?

1252
01:24:36,403 --> 01:24:38,685
[I'm sure he's not...
But they've been too lax about their guard]

1253
01:24:38,685 --> 01:24:43,564
-Because we're always fooling each other...
-Yes, there's a lot of that.

1254
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:47,044
I didn't say that to cause any harm.

1255
01:24:47,409 --> 01:24:50,036
I just said it to make sure.

1256
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:56,179
[If... Park Ji Sung... Is a spy?]
If I'm the spy, I'm sure I'll be caught quick.

1257
01:24:57,728 --> 01:25:01,042
[Will he really be caught right away
like he says?]

1258
01:25:01,043 --> 01:25:03,792
Since you have such a poker face,
it may be advantageous to be a spy.

1259
01:25:03,793 --> 01:25:06,387
Getting scolded by the shop keeper...

1260
01:25:06,389 --> 01:25:08,547
And even when you got
scolded by all the ladies...

1261
01:25:08,547 --> 01:25:12,670
But you still... Didn't seem fazed.

1262
01:25:12,671 --> 01:25:15,284
I really couldn't believe that!

1263
01:25:15,675 --> 01:25:21,324
[Could he... Really be a spy?]

1264
01:25:22,837 --> 01:25:28,146
[Before the races began early this morning...]

1265
01:25:28,148 --> 01:25:29,945
-Hello.
-Hello.

1266
01:25:29,947 --> 01:25:33,199
[He is already at a location]
Do you know why you're here?

1267
01:25:35,367 --> 01:25:39,581
Yes... I get the feeling there's something
that I have to do.

1268
01:25:41,149 --> 01:25:45,785
I'm sure you know since you've watched
our show, but there's a reason why...

1269
01:25:45,786 --> 01:25:47,154
That's why we've called you here.

1270
01:25:47,154 --> 01:25:50,326
-Can I look at it now?
-Yes, go ahead and read it.

1271
01:25:50,603 --> 01:25:53,609
[On the mission card...]

1272
01:25:54,768 --> 01:25:56,489
Spy mission.

1273
01:25:56,490 --> 01:25:59,717
You're a spy.
Oust the members of Running Man!

1274
01:25:59,993 --> 01:26:02,425
However, you can scout one member as partner.

1275
01:26:02,426 --> 01:26:06,896
There are rules that we have for you
as our spy today.

1276
01:26:07,413 --> 01:26:11,421
This is... Scout.

1277
01:26:12,309 --> 01:26:15,067
You're familiar with scouting, right?

1278
01:26:15,068 --> 01:26:19,409
-Yes... In soccer, players get scouted.
-That's right.

1279
01:26:19,643 --> 01:26:23,354
You can pick one other spy.

1280
01:26:23,354 --> 01:26:25,812
-Me?  Anyone?
-Yes.

1281
01:26:25,813 --> 01:26:28,702
-However I want?
-No, not like that.

1282
01:26:30,661 --> 01:26:33,582
If you're by any chance allowed to pick
whomever you want...?

1283
01:26:33,582 --> 01:26:35,695
That would of course be Mr. Capable.

1284
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:39,649
[This is?]

1285
01:26:41,645 --> 01:26:43,822
This is a spy scout menu.

1286
01:26:43,823 --> 01:26:47,072
There will be 2 races today.

1287
01:26:47,073 --> 01:26:51,066
You have to take the prize winnings
before the races are over.

1288
01:26:51,067 --> 01:26:54,266
-Both missions?
-Both missions.  And...

1289
01:26:54,698 --> 01:26:59,301
And you scored 7 goals when you
played the psychic soccer.

1290
01:26:59,302 --> 01:27:02,027
By myself?  Ah, I see.

1291
01:27:02,061 --> 01:27:06,506
You will be given 500 Baht for
each of those goals.

1292
01:27:09,498 --> 01:27:12,148
If that was the case,
I would've made all the goals myself.

1293
01:27:13,149 --> 01:27:15,537
I guess that's all I can do about that.

1294
01:27:16,087 --> 01:27:21,675
You will start off with 3500 baht.

1295
01:27:23,506 --> 01:27:24,826
Just for now.

1296
01:27:24,827 --> 01:27:28,430
Who else would you pick
other than Kim Jong Kook?

1297
01:27:29,371 --> 01:27:30,614
I don't know...

1298
01:27:30,615 --> 01:27:33,135
I feel like Gary's going to
get caught quickly.

1299
01:27:34,965 --> 01:27:38,536
If... I had the money...

1300
01:27:38,898 --> 01:27:41,023
I would take Song Ji Hyo.

1301
01:27:41,024 --> 01:27:46,761
But that would be hard since the big timers
usually don't get transferred easily.

1302
01:27:47,457 --> 01:27:50,131
If they don't want it themselves,
it usually doesn't work.

1303
01:27:51,252 --> 01:27:53,313
Ah... I don't know who it may be,

1304
01:27:53,314 --> 01:27:56,892
I will work hard with my fellow spy...

1305
01:27:57,073 --> 01:28:02,195
Since we didn't win any this season...
On Running Man, I'll make sure...

1306
01:28:02,197 --> 01:28:04,980
To show the winning side of me.
Fighting!

1307
01:28:07,908 --> 01:28:10,454
Kim Jong Kook and Park Ji Sung
need to go up against one another.

1308
01:28:10,456 --> 01:28:11,752
Where did Park Ji Sung go?

1309
01:28:11,753 --> 01:28:14,711
[The hottest face-off
in Running Man's history]

1310
01:28:14,712 --> 01:28:16,593

[A face-off that's on a different dimension]

1314
01:28:23,740 --> 01:28:26,408
[And Jae Suk's secret mission...?]
You're not playing a joke, right?

1315
01:28:27,551 --> 01:28:30,152
[Park Ji Sung to carry out
Yoo Jae Suk's mission!]
