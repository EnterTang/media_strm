Come on.

259
00:15:35,342 --> 00:15:37,261
倒底怎么样?
Really,
what's going on?

260
00:15:37,302 --> 00:15:39,513
我知道心怀鬼胎的人
l know when people
are up to something.

261
00:15:39,555 --> 00:15:42,349
－ 我可以闻出来
－ 她闻的正常?
￡- l can smell it.
￡- And she smells all right?

262
00:15:42,349 --> 00:15:44,309
她很正常
She smells very good.

263
00:15:47,437 --> 00:15:50,691
天啊 她收买你了!
Oh my God, she got to you,
didn't she?

264
00:15:50,732 --> 00:15:54,111
－ 你成帮凶了
－ 别说胡话
￡- You're both in on it.
￡- You're talking crazy.

265
00:15:54,194 --> 00:15:58,031
－ 你当然愿意帮她了
－什么
￡- Sure, you'd love to get me too, huh?
￡- What?

266
00:15:58,073 --> 00:16:00,367
你也想我出丑
You'd love
to see me humiliated.

267
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:03,453
不是吗?哥?
lsn't that right,
my brother?

268
00:16:10,961 --> 00:16:13,839
Raymond Raymond
Raymond
Raymond, Raymond,
Raymond.

269
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,788
好
All right.

270
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,999
醒醒!
Wake up, wake up.

271
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,001
怎么了?
What?
What's wrong?

272
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:54,129
告诉你我取消了
Just so you know,
l canceled it.

273
00:16:54,171 --> 00:16:56,089
－ 取消什么了?
－ 高尔夫比赛
￡- What? Canceled what?
￡- The golf outing.

274
00:16:56,131 --> 00:16:59,009
－ 我退出了
－ 为什么?
￡- Backed out.
￡- What? Why?

275
00:16:59,009 --> 00:17:02,179
为什么?因为你闻起来不对
甜心
Why? Because you smell,
sweetheart.

276
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:08,894
天啊 我得离你远点
Oh my God,
l have to leave you.

277
00:17:10,687 --> 00:17:13,065
这就是为什么你那么做
No, no. That's where
you're gonna do it.

278
00:17:13,106 --> 00:17:16,318
我知道你设下圈套的方式
我知道你怎么想
That's where you're gonna set
your trap. l know how your mind works.

279
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,613
你自己想什么都不知道
You don't even know
how your mind works.

280
00:17:19,613 --> 00:17:22,824
我不会报复你
l'm not going to get you.

281
00:17:22,866 --> 00:17:25,118
你就做了吧
Will you just do it?
All right, come on!

282
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,538
不管你怎么报复, 现在就做吧
Whatever you're gonna do,
just do it now,

283
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,498
因为我再也无法忍受了
'cause l can't
take it anymore.

284
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,124
你真担心啊
You're really
worried about this.

285
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,919
－我不是担心我是焦虑
－ 那你焦虑了是不是
￡- l'm not worried, l'm anxious.
￡- So you're feeling anxious?

286
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:35,837
－我是焦虑
－ 别那样
￡- l'm feeling anxious.
￡- You shouldn't.

287
00:17:35,837 --> 00:17:37,256
－ 什么?
－别那样想
￡- What?
￡- Don't feel that way.

288
00:17:37,297 --> 00:17:39,508
别教我怎么感觉
Don't tell me
how to feel!

289
00:17:41,134 --> 00:17:43,554
这就是行了
And there it is.

290
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,225
什么?
Huh?

291
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:53,063
我把我的感觉给你了
l'll just give you a moment
to put it together.

292
00:17:57,192 --> 00:17:59,152
拍卖会以后, Ray
After the auction, Ray,

293
00:17:59,152 --> 00:18:01,321
当我感觉尴尬丢脸时候
when l was feeling
embarrassed and humiliated,

294
00:18:01,363 --> 00:18:03,282
你不就告诉我同样的话吗?
didn't you say
the same thing to me?

295
00:18:03,323 --> 00:18:06,827
－"别那么想"记得吗?
－我记得
￡- "Don't feel that way." Remember that?
￡- l do remember that.

296
00:18:06,869 --> 00:18:09,454
你开始折磨我的时候
Because that's when
you started torturing me.

297
00:18:09,496 --> 00:18:12,416
噢
Oh, oh￡-￡-

298
00:18:17,337 --> 00:18:19,464
其实你没做什么?
So you didn't do
anything?

299
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:23,218
你让我自讨苦吃?
You let me do this
to myself?

300
00:18:26,346 --> 00:18:28,307
一直以来我可以喝那汽水的
All week long
l could have had soda?

301
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:31,935
我可以吃蛋糕的
l could have had
brownies?

302
00:18:32,936 --> 00:18:34,855
我可以穿着内裤的
l could have worn
underwear?

303
00:18:38,442 --> 00:18:41,278
全是我的错?
So it was all me?

304
00:18:41,278 --> 00:18:43,238
这就是你报复我的办法
That's how you got me?

305
00:18:43,238 --> 00:18:47,618
没有什么方法
Nothing l could think
of could screw you up more

306
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:50,204
可以让你自己折磨自己更好的了
than what's already
in that beautiful mind.

307
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,000
晚安 Ray
Good night, Ray.

308
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:02,090
对啊 心在作怪
That's right,
beautiful mind.

309
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,178
现在心决定
'Cause it takes
a beautiful mind to come up

310
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:09,681
不取消参加高尔夫了
with not canceling
the golf outing,

311
00:19:09,723 --> 00:19:11,642
告诉你不去
but telling you
that l did

312
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:14,228
其实是骗你说真话的
just to get you
to spill your guts.

313
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:18,690
聪明的人不止你一个
Okay? You're not
the only clever one.

314
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,985
青出于蓝胜于蓝
You zig, l zag.

315
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:31,245
－ 你真取消了对吧?
－ 是的!
￡- You canceled it, didn't you?
￡- Yes!

316
00:19:36,818 --> 00:19:40,113
看见没Frank?
没蚊子
You see, Frank?
No mosquitoes.

317
00:19:41,865 --> 00:19:44,409
真好啊
Oh, this is lovely.

318
00:19:45,994 --> 00:19:48,830
我很高兴我们拍到了
l'm so glad
we won this.

319
00:19:48,872 --> 00:19:51,792
你总对好东西不感冒
You're always against
anything good.

320
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,628
只要是我喜欢的
Anything l might like.

321
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,297
这太花钱了
lt costs too much money.

322
00:19:57,339 --> 00:19:59,091
你就不能
Just have to￡-￡-

323
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:01,385
享受下生活?
why can't you
just enjoy life?

324
00:20:01,426 --> 00:20:04,012
哦起航了
Oh, here we go!

325
00:20:04,054 --> 00:20:07,641
Frank! Frank!
Frank!
Frank! Frank!
Frank!

326
00:20:07,683 --> 00:20:11,186
你做什么? 船上没桨!
What are you doing?
l don't have the paddles!

327
00:20:11,228 --> 00:20:12,688
Frank!
Frank!

328
00:20:12,729 --> 00:20:14,690
天啊 Frank!
Oh, Frank!
