1
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,763
Ooh, sorry Mr. Frost.

2
00:01:03,835 --> 00:01:05,359
I didn't mean to startle you.

3
00:01:05,437 --> 00:01:07,701
We're running a wee
bit late this morning.

4
00:01:07,772 --> 00:01:11,538
We overslept and Donald's
got a terrible migraine.

5
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,490
Nice sport this, isn't it?

6
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,868
I was thinking of
taking it up myself.

7
00:04:21,937 --> 00:04:25,839
Slow and gentle.

8
00:04:25,907 --> 00:04:27,670
Must get a lot of
thinking done, do you?

9
00:04:27,743 --> 00:04:30,371
If it's thinking you want,
try Open University.

10
00:04:30,445 --> 00:04:33,471
Competition this is.

11
00:04:33,548 --> 00:04:34,913
All right.

12
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:38,942
I saw a bloke catch
a body in here once.

13
00:04:39,021 --> 00:04:42,616
About a year ago, it was.

14
00:04:42,691 --> 00:04:43,658
I don't know what it weighed,

15
00:04:43,725 --> 00:04:44,987
but it wasn't half a big one.

16
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,618
Look, haven't you got
anything useful to do?

17
00:04:46,695 --> 00:04:49,721
You're frightening
the flaming fish.

18
00:04:49,798 --> 00:04:51,390
Sorry.

19
00:05:06,048 --> 00:05:07,913
Oi!

20
00:05:36,445 --> 00:05:38,242
Hi, Debs, just off?

21
00:05:38,313 --> 00:05:40,178
What's that, the
new (unintelligible)?

22
00:05:40,248 --> 00:05:41,613
You'd smell it if it was.

23
00:05:41,683 --> 00:05:44,083
Just a little something
to brighten my living room.

24
00:05:44,152 --> 00:05:45,779
How's the physio-therapy?

25
00:05:45,854 --> 00:05:46,843
I don't do physio.

26
00:05:46,922 --> 00:05:47,980
It's aroma therapy.

27
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,284
And you know that very well.

28
00:05:49,358 --> 00:05:50,586
It's fine, thank you, Les.

29
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:52,149
See you sometime.

30
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,024
Hello, Shangri.

31
00:06:29,664 --> 00:06:32,428
Anything else you
care to say to us?

32
00:06:32,501 --> 00:06:35,163
No sir, you've been
most considerate.

33
00:06:35,237 --> 00:06:36,670
What about you,
Chief Constable?

34
00:06:36,738 --> 00:06:37,796
Nothing, chairman.

35
00:06:37,873 --> 00:06:41,536
I think the file tells us
everything we need to know.

36
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,306
Well, then thank you,
Superintendent Mullett.

37
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:45,346
I have to say

38
00:06:45,414 --> 00:06:49,407
you've answered all our
questions very lucidly.

39
00:06:49,484 --> 00:06:52,385
If we should decide to recall
you for the final round,

40
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:55,946
you'll be hearing from us
within the next seven days.

41
00:06:56,024 --> 00:06:57,355
Thank you.

42
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:11,439
Glad to hear it, sir.

43
00:07:11,506 --> 00:07:13,235
Competition's weak too.

44
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,037
One word in the ear though.

45
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,441
Denton's time sheets.

46
00:07:16,511 --> 00:07:18,604
I'm informed they were
late again last month.

47
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,908
It is very important

48
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,745
to keep a tight ship
in the circumstances.

49
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:25,309
Remember, performance
is the big buzzword now.

50
00:07:25,387 --> 00:07:27,014
Yes, I do know that, sir.

51
00:07:27,088 --> 00:07:29,215
How's Jack Frost, by the way?

52
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,816
Awful, that young
Barnard's death.

53
00:07:31,893 --> 00:07:33,861
Must have been a
real blow for Jack.

54
00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:36,591
A lesser man would have
resigned from the force.

55
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:37,495
Colonel,

56
00:07:37,566 --> 00:07:39,431
a word in your ear.

57
00:08:26,248 --> 00:08:27,943
(Knock on door)

58
00:08:30,185 --> 00:08:31,413
Come.

59
00:08:32,954 --> 00:08:34,649
DS Wallace, sir.

60
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,558
Ah, DS Wallace.

61
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,824
Welcome back.

62
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:43,990
Thank you, sir.

63
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,497
How was the college?

64
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,401
The course went
very well, sir.

65
00:08:50,472 --> 00:08:51,905
Ambition.

66
00:08:51,973 --> 00:08:53,873
It's a very fine thing.

67
00:08:53,942 --> 00:08:55,500
I like your new office.

68
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,135
Yes, things have
changed a good deal

69
00:08:57,212 --> 00:08:58,372
since you were here last.

70
00:08:58,446 --> 00:08:59,606
For the better, I think.

71
00:08:59,681 --> 00:09:01,114
There's a modern
professional attitude

72
00:09:01,182 --> 00:09:02,911
right through the station.

73
00:09:02,984 --> 00:09:04,884
And you heard
about D.I. Frost?

74
00:09:04,953 --> 00:09:06,113
Yes, sir.

75
00:09:06,187 --> 00:09:08,985
Although I'm
surprised he resigned.

76
00:09:09,057 --> 00:09:10,752
Resigned?

77
00:09:10,825 --> 00:09:11,792
Who told you that?

78
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,827
No, no.

79
00:09:12,894 --> 00:09:16,990
The fact is I granted him
extended compassionate leave.

80
00:09:17,065 --> 00:09:20,501
The death of DS Barnard
hit him particularly hard.

81
00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:23,902
He always was an
emotional officer.

82
00:09:23,972 --> 00:09:25,997
Me too sir.

83
00:09:26,074 --> 00:09:28,406
I was very close to him once.

84
00:09:28,476 --> 00:09:30,171
What, Frost?

85
00:09:30,245 --> 00:09:32,805
I meant DS Barnard.

86
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:35,145
Really?

87
00:09:35,216 --> 00:09:36,478
The man at the top

88
00:09:36,551 --> 00:09:38,348
is always last to
know about these things.

89
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,787
Does that mean Inspector
Frost is coming back, sir?

90
00:09:41,856 --> 00:09:45,257
Well, better assume not.

91
00:09:45,327 --> 00:09:47,921
When I...

92
00:09:47,996 --> 00:09:49,156
The fact is, sergeant,

93
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,165
his leave has put me
in an awkward position.

94
00:09:52,233 --> 00:09:53,063
Well, you knew him,

95
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,431
you know what
I'm talking about.

96
00:09:54,502 --> 00:09:56,436
Frankly he left the
place a perfect tip.

97
00:09:56,504 --> 00:09:57,528
Always was his way.

98
00:09:57,606 --> 00:10:00,131
Well, it's no longer
our way, sergeant.

99
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,903
First job, I want you
to take over his office,

100
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:02,909
working to me.

101
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:03,967
Sort it all out.

102
00:10:04,045 --> 00:10:05,034
Just go through everything.

103
00:10:05,113 --> 00:10:06,171
Unfinished cases,

104
00:10:06,247 --> 00:10:07,578
untranscribed
interviews, notebooks.

105
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,082
Staff recharges,
time sheets.

106
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,050
The lot.

107
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:12,416
No witch-hunt mind,

108
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:17,356
but I need a very tight ship

109
00:10:17,425 --> 00:10:20,519
over the next
couple of weeks.

110
00:10:20,595 --> 00:10:23,189
Inspection, sir?

111
00:10:23,264 --> 00:10:27,257
As I said, ambition,

112
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,360
it's a very fine thing.

113
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,046
(Phone rings)

114
00:10:56,665 --> 00:10:58,030
Hello.

115
00:10:58,099 --> 00:11:02,035
Oh, it's you, how did I guess.

116
00:11:02,103 --> 00:11:02,967
No, not this one.

117
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:05,506
Not this time.

118
00:11:05,573 --> 00:11:08,770
Yes, I know that's what
we've done in the past.

119
00:11:08,843 --> 00:11:10,743
Up yours too.

120
00:11:50,618 --> 00:11:51,312
See you tomorrow,

121
00:11:51,386 --> 00:11:52,751
thank you.

122
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:50,104
Hi, anybody home?

123
00:12:50,178 --> 00:12:52,112
Course not, why ask?

124
00:13:26,481 --> 00:13:27,470
Hazel.

125
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:28,675
Hello, George.

126
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,014
It's good to see you again.

127
00:13:31,085 --> 00:13:34,680
Well, Mullett's given you
Jack's old office I see.

128
00:13:34,756 --> 00:13:36,485
It could do with
a perfume spray.

129
00:13:36,558 --> 00:13:38,822
He's asked me to go
through his paperwork.

130
00:13:38,893 --> 00:13:41,225
Rather you than me.

131
00:13:41,296 --> 00:13:42,388
Did you hear about Jack?

132
00:13:42,463 --> 00:13:43,225
Yeh?

133
00:13:43,298 --> 00:13:44,856
Mullett said he's on
compassionate leave.

134
00:13:44,933 --> 00:13:46,423
Crafty old devil.

135
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:48,162
No, Jack resigned.

136
00:13:48,236 --> 00:13:49,464
But Mullett
doesn't want to upset

137
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,731
the Chief Constable.

138
00:13:50,805 --> 00:13:52,864
Jack always was his
favorite copper.

139
00:13:52,941 --> 00:13:55,501
Yeah, I remember.

140
00:13:55,577 --> 00:13:57,067
What's he doing now?

141
00:13:57,145 --> 00:13:58,635
Wandering round Denton

142
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:01,079
dreaming he's free at last.

143
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:15,552
Mr. Frost.

144
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,995
Nice day?

145
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:18,555
Is it?

146
00:14:18,633 --> 00:14:21,397
I meant yours.

147
00:14:21,469 --> 00:14:23,801
No, not really, Brian.

148
00:14:23,872 --> 00:14:25,737
No, not really.

149
00:14:25,807 --> 00:14:28,674
Donald's doing
eggs Benedict tonight.

150
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,574
One of his specialties.

151
00:14:30,645 --> 00:14:32,510
He should really
be in a restaurant.

152
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,980
Yeah.

153
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:36,778
Yes all right, Brian.

154
00:14:36,851 --> 00:14:38,478
All right, thanks.

155
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,219
Shangri?

156
00:15:15,156 --> 00:15:16,384
Shangri?

157
00:15:17,592 --> 00:15:19,560
Puss, puss.

158
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,458
Puss.

159
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,997
Shangri.

160
00:15:34,075 --> 00:15:35,133
Hello.

161
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,442
Good girl.

162
00:15:38,513 --> 00:15:40,037
Do you want some dinner?

163
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:49,414
Ah, good evening, Norman.

164
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,422
Good evening.

165
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,458
Quite a coup for Denton.

166
00:15:51,526 --> 00:15:52,550
The Lydian Quartet.

167
00:15:52,627 --> 00:15:54,492
Yes, yes, absolutely.

168
00:15:59,033 --> 00:16:00,295
Well, well.

169
00:16:00,368 --> 00:16:02,063
The Bill goes classical?

170
00:16:02,136 --> 00:16:03,034
I'm sorry?

171
00:16:03,104 --> 00:16:06,665
I take it we are
off duty for once?

172
00:16:06,741 --> 00:16:08,038
You failed to recognize me

173
00:16:08,109 --> 00:16:09,576
without my mortuary gown.

174
00:16:09,644 --> 00:16:10,576
Derek Simpkins,

175
00:16:10,645 --> 00:16:12,613
your friendly
neighborhood pathologist.

176
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,910
Yes, of course.

177
00:16:14,983 --> 00:16:16,211
You know, Superintendent,

178
00:16:16,284 --> 00:16:17,342
I never had you down

179
00:16:17,418 --> 00:16:19,318
for a lover of serious music.

180
00:16:19,387 --> 00:16:20,513
Ah, well I'm not really.

181
00:16:20,588 --> 00:16:22,215
It's my wife Elsbeth.

182
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,121
She belongs to a small
music club you know.

183
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,057
Ah, there you are Diana.

184
00:16:26,127 --> 00:16:28,595
Remember
Superintendent Mullett?

185
00:16:28,663 --> 00:16:31,655
Yes, of course, good
evening Superintendent.

186
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:32,495
Are you?

187
00:16:32,567 --> 00:16:34,398
Waiting for my wife, yes.

188
00:16:34,469 --> 00:16:35,731
You'll have a long
wait, I'm afraid.

189
00:16:35,803 --> 00:16:37,168
In that case let's get seated.

190
00:16:37,238 --> 00:16:39,900
I can't bear to
have music interrupted.

191
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,879
You're not still at it?

192
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,679
This will take ages.

193
00:16:50,752 --> 00:16:52,652
I don't think Jack ever filed
a single thing in his life.

194
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,846
No, he thought
the filing cabinet

195
00:16:53,921 --> 00:16:56,082
was the same as the fridge.

196
00:16:56,157 --> 00:16:58,182
Have you checked his computer?

197
00:16:58,259 --> 00:16:59,658
His computer!

198
00:17:02,764 --> 00:17:06,165
Have you found anything
on the Black Farm Murder?

199
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,030
Black Farm?

200
00:17:07,101 --> 00:17:08,432
Yeah, take a look at that.

201
00:17:08,503 --> 00:17:10,095
It happened about
eight years ago.

202
00:17:10,171 --> 00:17:11,695
A rich farmer, Jonathan Dale

203
00:17:11,773 --> 00:17:13,638
was murdered
just outside Denton.

204
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,539
A tealeaf called
Branson went down for it,

205
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,134
died in prison last year.

206
00:17:17,211 --> 00:17:20,271
Now this new bloke says
he pulled the trigger.

207
00:17:20,348 --> 00:17:20,973
One of Jack's?

208
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:21,845
Oh, yeah.

209
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,474
Who fancies a nice night out?

210
00:17:23,551 --> 00:17:24,347
Who wouldn't?

211
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,387
Suspicious death,
Riverside Apartments.

212
00:17:26,454 --> 00:17:27,819
Jordan's already down there.

213
00:17:27,889 --> 00:17:28,913
Yeah.

214
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,150
Well, off you go.

215
00:17:30,224 --> 00:17:32,556
It's time for your first solo.

216
00:18:18,172 --> 00:18:19,298
It's this room here.

217
00:18:20,108 --> 00:18:21,735
Hello, Chris. what is it then?

218
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:22,867
One dead male,

219
00:18:22,944 --> 00:18:24,275
probable suicide.

220
00:18:24,345 --> 00:18:27,178
The girl from next
door Leonie Viner,

221
00:18:27,248 --> 00:18:29,113
found him when she
looked in to feed the cat.

222
00:18:29,183 --> 00:18:31,048
That's her, through there.

223
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:32,211
You did put someone with her?

224
00:18:32,286 --> 00:18:34,277
Yeah, a WPC.

225
00:18:34,355 --> 00:18:36,084
Yes, of course, right.

226
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:37,818
Better show me then.

227
00:18:37,892 --> 00:18:38,688
Right.

228
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:39,953
Through here.

229
00:18:40,928 --> 00:18:43,897
Leonie called a
doctor, lives upstairs.

230
00:18:43,965 --> 00:18:46,024
He said he'd been
dead an hour maybe two.

231
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:01,815
Got an ident yet?

232
00:19:01,883 --> 00:19:04,511
Yeah, she says
he's the tenant,

233
00:19:04,585 --> 00:19:06,553
Lester Bryce-Jones.

234
00:19:06,621 --> 00:19:07,645
He lived alone,

235
00:19:07,722 --> 00:19:09,587
except for a
large bunch of keys,

236
00:19:09,657 --> 00:19:11,420
some nice pictures,

237
00:19:11,492 --> 00:19:12,686
and his cat.

238
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,352
Leonie feeds it sometimes.

239
00:19:14,428 --> 00:19:15,520
She's very distressed,

240
00:19:15,596 --> 00:19:17,757
her mother's not home yet.

241
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,925
You said suicide?

242
00:19:21,002 --> 00:19:22,094
He'd been drinking,

243
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,104
taking pills.

244
00:19:24,172 --> 00:19:26,504
Couldn't it have been sexual?

245
00:19:26,574 --> 00:19:27,836
No idea, darling.

246
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:29,536
I'm a married man.

247
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,179
What's this?

248
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:41,419
A doctor?

249
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:05,310
(Beeper)

250
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:20,587
Duty calls.

251
00:20:20,661 --> 00:20:22,424
Yours probably!

252
00:20:33,474 --> 00:20:37,240
You could have a four
letter word ending in UCK.

253
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,112
There you are.

254
00:20:42,183 --> 00:20:43,172
Right, go on.

255
00:20:43,251 --> 00:20:44,149
How many's that then?

256
00:20:44,218 --> 00:20:45,344
You've got a
triple letter there,

257
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:48,547
so that makes twenty.

258
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:50,750
Some people have all the uck.

259
00:20:53,494 --> 00:20:54,756
Let's have another glass.

260
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:00,230
Ah, we're dry.

261
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,701
I'll go and ask Donald
for another bottle.

262
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,567
He makes a nice
selection, don't you think?

263
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,072
Uhu.

264
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,074
Or would you prefer
a cup of Horlicks?

265
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,167
No no, I'll stick with this.

266
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:12,540
DS Wallace,
thank you for coming.

267
00:21:12,613 --> 00:21:13,978
You are aware I was
at a chamber concert?

268
00:21:14,048 --> 00:21:14,742
Sorry.

269
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:15,747
Not seen you before.

270
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:16,714
New, are you?

271
00:21:16,784 --> 00:21:17,773
You have,
but you won't remember.

272
00:21:17,852 --> 00:21:18,910
I used to be in uniform.

273
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:19,918
Didn't they tell you?

274
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,148
I'm a pathologist,
not a police doctor.

275
00:21:22,223 --> 00:21:23,349
I don't attend crime scenes,

276
00:21:23,424 --> 00:21:25,392
I conduct autopsies
and forensic research.

277
00:21:25,459 --> 00:21:27,256
I thought a pathologist
ought to be on scene.

278
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:28,352
Did you really?

279
00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:29,418
I'm not sure it's suicide.

280
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:30,361
There are drugs around,

281
00:21:30,431 --> 00:21:31,864
possibly some
hospital connection.

282
00:21:31,932 --> 00:21:34,093
Oh well, get out
your notebook, Diana.

283
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:37,001
I don't generally take
it to concerts, Doctor.

284
00:21:37,071 --> 00:21:38,629
Will this do?

285
00:21:38,706 --> 00:21:42,142
Wouldn't have a stethoscope
in there as well, would you?

286
00:21:42,209 --> 00:21:43,767
In here I suppose?

287
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:49,073
Interesting.

288
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,944
Aah.

289
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:57,883
Over here, sir.

290
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,084
What's this then?

291
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,424
Our art collector?

292
00:22:01,495 --> 00:22:03,725
And you left him
hanging just for me.

293
00:22:03,798 --> 00:22:06,028
Mr. Lester Bryce-Jones.

294
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,727
I presume a doctor
looked at him already?

295
00:22:07,802 --> 00:22:09,793
Yes, sir, said he was dead.

296
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,430
Brilliant, can't
be faulted, can he?

297
00:22:12,506 --> 00:22:14,098
What of, though?

298
00:22:14,175 --> 00:22:15,574
He thought hanging, sir.

299
00:22:15,643 --> 00:22:17,907
We'll decide that
at the post-mortem.

300
00:22:17,978 --> 00:22:21,345
But I see why you
need a pathologist.

301
00:22:21,415 --> 00:22:22,780
Anything else here
that might be lethal?

302
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,647
He seems to have taken drugs.

303
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:25,811
There are more
in the bathroom.

304
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,878
These aren't drugs,
these are medicines.

305
00:22:28,956 --> 00:22:30,787
Come here, Diana, will you?

306
00:22:35,463 --> 00:22:38,899
What's all this
on his eyelids?

307
00:22:38,966 --> 00:22:41,366
That's mascara, doctor.

308
00:22:56,484 --> 00:22:57,849
What's going on?

309
00:23:09,463 --> 00:23:11,658
Darling are you all right?

310
00:23:11,732 --> 00:23:13,791
You should have called me.

311
00:23:13,868 --> 00:23:15,392
You don't like me to.

312
00:23:15,469 --> 00:23:16,731
Mrs. Viner?

313
00:23:16,804 --> 00:23:18,465
Let me tell you, your
daughter's been brilliant.

314
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:19,403
She called the doctor.

315
00:23:19,473 --> 00:23:20,235
And the police.

316
00:23:20,307 --> 00:23:22,400
I know she's
brilliant, thank you.

317
00:23:22,476 --> 00:23:23,636
Why did you go in there?

318
00:23:23,711 --> 00:23:24,769
To feed Shangri,

319
00:23:24,845 --> 00:23:27,473
I thought he was out.

320
00:23:27,548 --> 00:23:29,243
Anyway, what happened?

321
00:23:29,316 --> 00:23:30,374
I saw him in the hall earlier.

322
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:31,918
He seemed fine.

323
00:23:31,986 --> 00:23:33,248
Why did he do it?

324
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,218
Kill himself?

325
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:36,256
We don't know that
he did, Mrs. Viner.

326
00:23:36,323 --> 00:23:37,654
What else then?

327
00:23:37,725 --> 00:23:39,750
I mean, surely nobody
would want to murder Les.

328
00:23:39,827 --> 00:23:42,057
You knew him quite well then?

329
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,029
We need a formal
identification.

330
00:23:44,098 --> 00:23:44,928
Oh no, no, no.

331
00:23:44,999 --> 00:23:45,829
I didn't know him.

332
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,265
Not really.

333
00:23:47,334 --> 00:23:48,767
He must have
relatives somewhere.

334
00:23:48,836 --> 00:23:49,768
Do you know where?

335
00:23:49,837 --> 00:23:50,861
No, I don't know where.

336
00:23:50,938 --> 00:23:52,405
I don't know
anything about him.

337
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:53,963
He'd only lived there a year.

338
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:54,905
Now go away, please,

339
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,704
I want to look
after my daughter.

340
00:23:56,777 --> 00:23:58,108
Leonie, I'm sorry,

341
00:23:58,179 --> 00:23:59,737
we're going to have to
talk to you again tomorrow,

342
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:01,304
as a witness.

343
00:24:01,382 --> 00:24:02,440
Will you be all right tonight?

344
00:24:02,516 --> 00:24:03,813
Of course she will,

345
00:24:03,884 --> 00:24:06,045
now please go.

346
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,020
Ssh, it's all right,
it's all right.

347
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:11,416
There we go, Mr. Frost.

348
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:13,722
Donald says enjoy.

349
00:24:13,794 --> 00:24:15,625
In that case I will
Brian, thank you.

350
00:24:15,696 --> 00:24:17,687
You should really
try muesli sometimes.

351
00:24:17,765 --> 00:24:19,858
It's a lot better
for the bowels.

352
00:24:19,934 --> 00:24:22,198
Oh, I nearly forgot.

353
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:22,963
Letter for you.

354
00:24:23,037 --> 00:24:24,402
Oh, right.

355
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,275
Well, blow me.

356
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:38,545
Good news, is it?

357
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:40,849
Granny died and left
you a massive fortune?

358
00:24:40,921 --> 00:24:42,115
Well, very nearly.

359
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,316
About a year ago
I burnt my house down

360
00:24:44,391 --> 00:24:47,019
because I wasn't paying due
care and attention, was I?

361
00:24:47,094 --> 00:24:49,426
So half a lifetime,
you know, went up in smoke.

362
00:24:49,497 --> 00:24:50,964
Doesn't sound like
very good news to me.

363
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,431
Ah, but I was insured.

364
00:24:53,501 --> 00:24:54,763
God knows how because

365
00:24:54,835 --> 00:24:57,429
I could never remember
sensible things like that.

366
00:24:57,505 --> 00:24:59,871
"...Iike to advise you the
process of refurbishment

367
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,464
is complete and your property

368
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:04,170
will shortly be available
for reoccupation... "

369
00:25:04,245 --> 00:25:05,644
Oh, Mr. Frost.

370
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:07,908
I'd say that calls
for a celebration.

371
00:25:07,982 --> 00:25:09,449
So do I.

372
00:25:09,517 --> 00:25:11,576
Let's have some fried bread?

373
00:25:11,652 --> 00:25:15,088
I really wouldn't like to
be your stomach, Mr. Frost.

374
00:25:15,155 --> 00:25:18,522
Donald, Mr. Frost
wants some fried bread!

375
00:25:21,428 --> 00:25:22,861
Why?

376
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,454
Why was the
Black Farm murder file

377
00:25:24,532 --> 00:25:27,000
removed from the records?

378
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,398
No idea, sir.

379
00:25:28,469 --> 00:25:30,300
It must have been
for fresh inquiries.

380
00:25:30,371 --> 00:25:31,099
Well, who took it?

381
00:25:31,171 --> 00:25:32,763
Why wasn't it signed for?

382
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,137
I can't imagine, sir.

383
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:37,109
This is a disciplinary matter.

384
00:25:37,177 --> 00:25:39,008
I've called a press conference
on the Black Farm Murder

385
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,410
in an hour's time.

386
00:25:40,481 --> 00:25:43,507
Somehow I assumed
I'd have the file with me.

387
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:44,881
Find DS Wallace.

388
00:25:44,952 --> 00:25:46,442
She's on a case, sir.

389
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,853
Dead male, Riverside
Apartments, possible murder.

390
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:51,858
Isn't it all on the computer?

391
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:53,359
This was eight
years ago, Toolan.

392
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:55,895
Before we had computers,
if you remember.

393
00:25:55,963 --> 00:25:58,090
Yes, I do remember, sir.

394
00:25:58,165 --> 00:25:59,860
Sergeant, come here.

395
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:07,305
I need that file at once.

396
00:26:07,374 --> 00:26:11,504
Now do I have to start
an official investigation?

397
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:13,137
Very well, sir.

398
00:26:13,213 --> 00:26:15,579
You'd better come and see.

399
00:26:25,826 --> 00:26:27,088
And what's that?

400
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:33,659
Well, that must be one of
Jack's little jokes, sir.

401
00:26:33,734 --> 00:26:34,894
It's here.

402
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:36,402
Ah, at least it hasn't
left the building.

403
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,267
Well, you'd better
look inside, sir.

404
00:26:41,942 --> 00:26:43,466
I see.

405
00:26:43,544 --> 00:26:45,478
Is that another
of Jack's little jokes?

406
00:26:45,546 --> 00:26:47,207
Well, he must have taken
the stuff home with him.

407
00:26:47,281 --> 00:26:48,839
Well it's totally irregular.

408
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:50,508
Yes it is sir.

409
00:26:50,584 --> 00:26:52,313
But I expect he
meant to bring it back

410
00:26:52,386 --> 00:26:55,378
when he returned from his
compassionate leave, sir.

411
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:08,028
It's not the only one, is it?

412
00:27:08,102 --> 00:27:10,070
Jack liked to keep
things in his head.

413
00:27:10,137 --> 00:27:11,434
Right that does it.

414
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:12,267
I want his head

415
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,670
and I want it on the block.

416
00:27:13,741 --> 00:27:14,639
Find him, bring him to me.

417
00:27:14,708 --> 00:27:15,538
And that file.

418
00:27:15,609 --> 00:27:17,304
I'm not quite sure
where he's living, sir.

419
00:27:17,378 --> 00:27:18,970
Then start a search for him.

420
00:27:19,046 --> 00:27:20,035
Arrest him if necessary.

421
00:27:20,114 --> 00:27:21,012
Arrest him?

422
00:27:21,081 --> 00:27:21,843
Yes.

423
00:27:21,915 --> 00:27:23,473
He's broken procedural rules.

424
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,177
He's impeding
an urgent inquiry.

425
00:27:25,252 --> 00:27:27,618
He's bringing the
force into disrepute.

426
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:28,450
You heard me.

427
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:30,012
Arrest him!

428
00:27:42,136 --> 00:27:42,864
Mr. Frost.

429
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,625
Hello there.

430
00:27:33,701 --> 00:27:34,224
Hi.

431
00:27:34,302 --> 00:27:35,462
Hi.

432
00:27:35,536 --> 00:27:36,264
Here we are.

433
00:27:36,337 --> 00:27:38,168
All ready for inspection.

434
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,672
Yes, It's nice.

435
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:40,867
Very very nice.

436
00:27:40,942 --> 00:27:42,375
You'll be pleased
to have it back.

437
00:27:42,443 --> 00:27:44,570
After all,
home is always home.

438
00:27:44,645 --> 00:27:45,976
Full of memories.

439
00:27:46,047 --> 00:27:47,105
Family.

440
00:27:47,181 --> 00:27:49,012
You never forget, do you?

441
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:50,846
No, I know what you mean.

442
00:27:50,918 --> 00:27:53,011
We've restored most
fixtures and fittings

443
00:27:53,087 --> 00:27:54,577
and we're willing to
pay a reasonable sum

444
00:27:54,655 --> 00:27:55,622
for furniture replacement.

445
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:56,622
That's very good.

446
00:27:56,691 --> 00:27:57,715
Shall we look around?

447
00:27:57,792 --> 00:28:00,556
I wonder, if you'd mind.

448
00:28:00,628 --> 00:28:02,789
I like to look
around on my own.

449
00:28:02,864 --> 00:28:05,628
Yeah, sure.

450
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,530
It's all yours.

451
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,364
Oh, thank you.

452
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:09,562
My pleasure.

453
00:28:09,637 --> 00:28:10,365
Bye now.

454
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,598
Goodbye.

455
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,092
Looks like one of ours.

456
00:29:08,168 --> 00:29:09,965
Certainly has
our laundry mark.

457
00:29:10,037 --> 00:29:11,902
But you can't tell
who it belongs to?

458
00:29:11,972 --> 00:29:13,303
One of the doctors perhaps?

459
00:29:13,374 --> 00:29:14,102
Doctor?

460
00:29:14,174 --> 00:29:15,072
No.

461
00:29:15,142 --> 00:29:16,905
More likely
one of the porters.

462
00:29:16,977 --> 00:29:18,535
A porter?

463
00:29:18,612 --> 00:29:19,874
How much would he earn?

464
00:29:19,947 --> 00:29:21,073
Working all hours?

465
00:29:21,148 --> 00:29:22,740
Say a thousand a month.

466
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,113
Not a lot is it?

467
00:29:24,184 --> 00:29:25,583
If you want a lot of anything,

468
00:29:25,652 --> 00:29:27,677
you don't work for the NHS.

469
00:29:27,755 --> 00:29:30,417
Anyway these days it's
nothing to do with us.

470
00:29:30,491 --> 00:29:32,550
It's a privatized service.

471
00:29:32,626 --> 00:29:35,424
All to do with
the internal market.

472
00:29:35,496 --> 00:29:36,929
You'd best talk
to the contractors.

473
00:29:36,997 --> 00:29:39,625
They might be
able to help you.

474
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,895
They're in the High Street.

475
00:29:41,969 --> 00:29:43,095
Thank you.

476
00:29:52,413 --> 00:29:53,744
It's very comfortable
isn't it, sir.

477
00:29:53,814 --> 00:29:54,803
Ideal for the study.

478
00:29:54,882 --> 00:29:55,746
Yes, yes.

479
00:29:55,816 --> 00:29:57,283
Very pricey though, I bet.

480
00:29:57,351 --> 00:29:59,012
It is genuine cowhide though.

481
00:29:59,086 --> 00:29:59,984
Ah, is it?

482
00:30:00,053 --> 00:30:02,647
all right, well,
I don't think so.

483
00:30:02,723 --> 00:30:05,954
Well, I don't think
my insurance company
will stretch to it.

484
00:30:06,026 --> 00:30:08,324
They're a bit
worried about BSE.

485
00:30:08,395 --> 00:30:09,293
Well, if there's a problem,

486
00:30:09,363 --> 00:30:10,660
we can arrange a
year before payment,

487
00:30:10,731 --> 00:30:11,959
or no percent finance...

488
00:30:24,545 --> 00:30:26,342
No joy, sorry.

489
00:30:26,413 --> 00:30:28,813
We never employed
a Lester Bryce-Jones.

490
00:30:28,882 --> 00:30:30,281
Do you recognize him?

491
00:30:32,719 --> 00:30:34,653
Don't think so.

492
00:30:34,721 --> 00:30:36,416
Nice boy though.

493
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:38,185
He isn't now.

494
00:30:39,293 --> 00:30:40,521
When you employ people,

495
00:30:40,594 --> 00:30:42,425
do you check
their drugs record?

496
00:30:42,496 --> 00:30:43,485
If they'd been busted

497
00:30:43,564 --> 00:30:45,191
we wouldn't have hired them.

498
00:30:45,265 --> 00:30:47,290
How would you know?

499
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:49,562
If they put it on a form?

500
00:30:49,636 --> 00:30:51,695
Can I see a form?

501
00:30:56,176 --> 00:30:57,575
(Car horn)

502
00:31:03,851 --> 00:31:04,840
Mr. Frost?

503
00:31:04,918 --> 00:31:06,180
Yes?

504
00:31:06,253 --> 00:31:07,618
Can you come with us, please?

505
00:31:07,688 --> 00:31:08,882
Do what?

506
00:31:08,956 --> 00:31:10,856
Mr. Mulletts orders sir.

507
00:31:10,924 --> 00:31:12,414
You are joking?

508
00:31:12,493 --> 00:31:14,324
Look, all right!

509
00:31:14,394 --> 00:31:16,521
You're going to
be in big trouble!

510
00:31:16,597 --> 00:31:19,862
I'll tell ya,
(unintelligible).

511
00:31:19,933 --> 00:31:22,163
All right I can
manage, thank you!

512
00:31:28,642 --> 00:31:29,370
Right.

513
00:31:29,443 --> 00:31:31,035
Good morning.

514
00:31:31,111 --> 00:31:33,807
Thank you for coming.

515
00:31:33,881 --> 00:31:35,712
Now I've called
this conference

516
00:31:35,782 --> 00:31:37,340
in view of the
recent press story

517
00:31:37,417 --> 00:31:40,045
about the Black Farm Murder.

518
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,418
It may seem that there's
been a new development

519
00:31:42,489 --> 00:31:43,581
and that we...

520
00:31:43,657 --> 00:31:45,887
Jailed the wrong man.

521
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:47,722
There's no evidence
of that Mr. Longford.

522
00:31:47,794 --> 00:31:49,125
A man was tried and convicted

523
00:31:49,196 --> 00:31:51,460
after a thorough investigation
by a senior officer.

524
00:31:51,532 --> 00:31:52,396
Jack Frost?

525
00:31:52,466 --> 00:31:53,490
Yes.

526
00:31:53,567 --> 00:31:57,333
So this confession in
Spain by Mr. Ferdie Giggs,

527
00:31:57,404 --> 00:31:59,201
you don't recognize
it as genuine?

528
00:31:59,273 --> 00:32:01,138
That is an
uncorroborated interview

529
00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:03,005
given by a foreign journalist

530
00:32:03,076 --> 00:32:04,839
with someone we don't know.

531
00:32:04,912 --> 00:32:06,470
You don't know him?

532
00:32:06,547 --> 00:32:09,107
But he was interviewed
as a suspect at
the time, wasn't he?

533
00:32:09,182 --> 00:32:12,640
By Detective
Inspector Frost.

534
00:32:12,719 --> 00:32:14,152
As far as we are aware,

535
00:32:14,221 --> 00:32:16,689
he was never seriously
considered as a suspect.

536
00:32:16,757 --> 00:32:19,282
He claims he was at
the scene of the crime.

537
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:20,155
Does he?

538
00:32:20,227 --> 00:32:23,196
He'd have to be, if he did it.

539
00:32:23,263 --> 00:32:24,821
What do police records show?

540
00:32:24,898 --> 00:32:26,388
Mr. Giggs' statement
will be looked into

541
00:32:26,466 --> 00:32:28,457
and any necessary
action taken.

542
00:32:28,535 --> 00:32:30,162
Even reopening
the whole enquiry?

543
00:32:30,237 --> 00:32:31,829
Yes, if the
evidence warrants it.

544
00:32:31,905 --> 00:32:33,202
So, if you'll bear with me

545
00:32:33,273 --> 00:32:35,833
until the full
facts are available,

546
00:32:35,909 --> 00:32:37,240
I'll call another
conference then.

547
00:32:37,311 --> 00:32:39,040
Thank you very much.

548
00:32:42,249 --> 00:32:43,113
Still no Frost?

549
00:32:43,183 --> 00:32:43,911
No, sir.

550
00:32:43,984 --> 00:32:45,042
Well, who's looking for him?

551
00:32:45,118 --> 00:32:46,244
Mr. Toolan.

552
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,048
Well,

553
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,418
several things to make
the day an interesting one.

554
00:32:49,489 --> 00:32:50,922
First, apart from being dead,

555
00:32:50,991 --> 00:32:52,015
he was very healthy.

556
00:32:52,092 --> 00:32:53,184
Suntanned.

557
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,693
Could have
used a health club.

558
00:32:54,761 --> 00:32:56,661
Two, he was gay.

559
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,095
There are certain well,

560
00:32:58,165 --> 00:32:59,792
clear indications.

561
00:32:59,866 --> 00:33:00,696
This could explain

562
00:33:00,767 --> 00:33:03,861
why he used mascara
and faint face make-up.

563
00:33:03,937 --> 00:33:05,905
Might have been
an actor of course.

564
00:33:05,973 --> 00:33:08,237
Three, dental work
wasn't done here.

565
00:33:08,308 --> 00:33:09,502
Maybe America.

566
00:33:09,576 --> 00:33:11,100
It's a long way
to go to the dentist.

567
00:33:11,178 --> 00:33:13,510
Four, he had a severe
fracture of the tibia,

568
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,877
maybe ten years old.

569
00:33:14,948 --> 00:33:16,279
So he took painkillers.

570
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:18,079
He wasn't a druggie, though.

571
00:33:18,151 --> 00:33:20,984
I'll fill this in and
Diana will give you a copy.

572
00:33:21,054 --> 00:33:24,023
A. Disease or condition
leading directly to death,

573
00:33:24,091 --> 00:33:25,615
Massive constriction
of the throat.

574
00:33:25,692 --> 00:33:27,751
Otherwise
asphyxiation by hanging.

575
00:33:27,828 --> 00:33:29,056
That's definite now, sir?

576
00:33:29,129 --> 00:33:29,993
Yes.

577
00:33:30,063 --> 00:33:32,964
B. Other disease or
condition leading to

578
00:33:33,033 --> 00:33:33,931
A. Drugs overdose,

579
00:33:34,001 --> 00:33:35,195
specifically painkillers

580
00:33:35,268 --> 00:33:37,327
dextroproproxyphene,

581
00:33:37,404 --> 00:33:39,838
which may have produced
unconsciousness.

582
00:33:39,906 --> 00:33:40,736
I see.

583
00:33:40,807 --> 00:33:42,638
C. Have I reported
the case to the coroner

584
00:33:42,709 --> 00:33:43,607
for further action?

585
00:33:43,677 --> 00:33:44,871
Yes, I have.

586
00:33:44,945 --> 00:33:46,105
Which will presumably result

587
00:33:46,179 --> 00:33:48,477
in a verdict of
death by misadventure.

588
00:33:48,548 --> 00:33:50,175
Could it have been murder?

589
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,239
If he was unconscious,

590
00:33:51,318 --> 00:33:52,751
he could hardly
have hanged himself.

591
00:33:52,819 --> 00:33:54,286
Unless he was experimenting.

592
00:33:54,354 --> 00:33:58,313
We'll leave those subtleties
to the coroner, shall we?

593
00:33:58,392 --> 00:34:00,587
Evidence of
identification, your problem.

594
00:34:00,661 --> 00:34:02,822
Diana will give you dental
records and fingerprints

595
00:34:02,896 --> 00:34:05,296
so you can check them with
your usual due diligence.

596
00:34:05,365 --> 00:34:07,094
Found out anything
about him, sergeant?

597
00:34:07,167 --> 00:34:08,691
Not much.

598
00:34:08,769 --> 00:34:09,599
But if it's foul play

599
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,535
it passes to
a senior officer.

600
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,524
Oh, Jack.

601
00:34:18,037 --> 00:34:20,267
Well, how are you?

602
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,774
Well, it's very
nice of you to ask,

603
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,369
since I gather you issued
a warrant for my arrest.

604
00:34:26,438 --> 00:34:27,530
Nonsense, Jack,

605
00:34:27,606 --> 00:34:30,166
I just needed you
back here in a hurry.

606
00:34:30,242 --> 00:34:32,301
Why don't you sit down.

607
00:34:32,377 --> 00:34:33,469
All right, thank you.

608
00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:40,777
Now, things are in a real...

609
00:34:40,852 --> 00:34:43,343
You do realize you're still
on the strength don't you?

610
00:34:43,421 --> 00:34:45,616
Didn't you get my
letter of resignation?

611
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:46,554
Of course.

612
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:48,525
You handed it to me yourself.

613
00:34:48,593 --> 00:34:50,618
I've kept it here

614
00:34:50,695 --> 00:34:51,787
under lock and key.

615
00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:55,828
Now I realize it was written

616
00:34:55,901 --> 00:35:02,170
in emotional circumstances.

617
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,468
Yes, it was.

618
00:35:03,542 --> 00:35:07,239
I just wanted to give
you time to reconsider.

619
00:35:07,312 --> 00:35:13,308
Well, both of us
time to reconsider.

620
00:35:13,385 --> 00:35:15,216
That's very nice.

621
00:35:15,287 --> 00:35:16,618
And there's me imagining

622
00:35:16,688 --> 00:35:19,350
that you were over the moon.

623
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:21,085
Jack, I won't deny that

624
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:23,457
Iife has been quieter
over the last month.

625
00:35:23,528 --> 00:35:25,086
Until lately, anyhow.

626
00:35:25,163 --> 00:35:27,859
But you're missed, Jack.

627
00:35:27,933 --> 00:35:29,457
Sorely missed.

628
00:35:29,534 --> 00:35:30,330
You do realize....

629
00:35:30,402 --> 00:35:33,735
I heard about your
application for promotion.

630
00:35:33,805 --> 00:35:35,033
Really?

631
00:35:35,106 --> 00:35:37,939
Funny how news
gets round, isn't it?

632
00:35:38,009 --> 00:35:40,239
Mind you it
must be a bad time

633
00:35:40,312 --> 00:35:44,339
having a senior
officer retire.

634
00:35:44,416 --> 00:35:46,941
Especially the
Chief Constable's darling.

635
00:35:47,018 --> 00:35:48,144
That has got
nothing to do with it.

636
00:35:48,219 --> 00:35:51,279
Private ambition doesn't
come into this at all.

637
00:35:51,356 --> 00:35:52,584
The point is
that since you left

638
00:35:52,657 --> 00:35:54,818
we've had two major
problems at this station,

639
00:35:54,893 --> 00:35:56,724
both of them
connected with you.

640
00:35:56,795 --> 00:35:58,490
First it was
the time sheets...

641
00:35:58,563 --> 00:35:59,825
You haven't called
me back here

642
00:35:59,898 --> 00:36:01,525
to talk about time
sheets, have you?

643
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,899
These days we need to
keep a very tight ship.

644
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:07,268
Now it's the
Black Farm Murder.

645
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:09,068
But you've seen
the press reports.

646
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:12,132
It seems we can't
settle it without you.

647
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,678
It seems to be a
very poor reflection

648
00:36:14,746 --> 00:36:15,974
on the other
officers, doesn't it?

649
00:36:16,047 --> 00:36:18,948
Because when we looked
for the file it wasn't there.

650
00:36:19,017 --> 00:36:19,949
And even if it had been

651
00:36:20,018 --> 00:36:21,542
I don't suppose there'd
have been anything
in it, would there?

652
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,917
Now I want you to
get back to that case,

653
00:36:22,988 --> 00:36:25,320
and this time I want
you to do things properly.

654
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,857
Everything in the notebook,

655
00:36:26,925 --> 00:36:28,688
everything on
the record sheet.

656
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,159
Expenses properly kept,

657
00:36:30,228 --> 00:36:31,786
files stored on the computer.

658
00:36:31,863 --> 00:36:33,956
Every problem I have in
this station at the moment

659
00:36:34,032 --> 00:36:35,932
is down to you and
your slipshod ways.

660
00:36:36,001 --> 00:36:39,095
Just remember,
nobody's indispensable.

661
00:36:43,341 --> 00:36:46,708
Well, all right then you
probably are indispensable!

662
00:36:51,983 --> 00:36:53,712
Jack.

663
00:36:57,188 --> 00:36:59,213
I'm going to
tear this letter up.

664
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:01,884
No, I think I'd better
hold onto it, sir.

665
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,790
You never know.

666
00:37:02,861 --> 00:37:05,887
One of us might
want to reconsider.

667
00:37:05,964 --> 00:37:08,933
Anyway, good luck sir.

668
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,490
What?

669
00:37:10,568 --> 00:37:11,535
With your promotion.

670
00:37:11,603 --> 00:37:12,865
You know,

671
00:37:12,937 --> 00:37:14,734
onward and upward.

672
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:19,604
Good morning.

673
00:37:19,678 --> 00:37:20,440
Nice to see you, guv.

674
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,274
Thank you.

675
00:37:21,346 --> 00:37:21,971
Jack?
Yes?

676
00:37:22,047 --> 00:37:24,743
Oh come on tell
me, how was it?

677
00:37:24,816 --> 00:37:26,977
Oh, you know, as well
as can be expected.

678
00:37:27,052 --> 00:37:29,486
He said I could
either be a DI again,

679
00:37:29,554 --> 00:37:30,612
or go to prison.

680
00:37:30,689 --> 00:37:32,316
Oh, difficult choice, eh?

681
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:34,654
Yeah, you could...

682
00:37:34,726 --> 00:37:37,661
Well, what the
hell is going on here?

683
00:37:37,729 --> 00:37:39,492
You turn your
back for five minutes

684
00:37:39,564 --> 00:37:40,826
and look what happens.

685
00:37:40,899 --> 00:37:42,389
You're lucky your
stuff's here at all.

686
00:37:42,467 --> 00:37:44,162
Mullett said put
it in the corridor.

687
00:37:44,235 --> 00:37:45,395
Yeah, but who did this?

688
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:47,631
Look they've completely
ruined my filing system.

689
00:37:47,706 --> 00:37:50,334
Sorry, guv, it was me.

690
00:37:50,408 --> 00:37:51,841
Well, well.

691
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:54,105
WPC Hazel Wallace!

692
00:37:54,179 --> 00:37:56,010
What are you doing here
without your clothes on?

693
00:37:56,081 --> 00:37:57,571
I've been made up.

694
00:37:57,649 --> 00:37:58,581
Detective Sergeant.

695
00:37:58,650 --> 00:37:59,981
Really, good, well done.

696
00:38:00,051 --> 00:38:02,281
If I'd known that I'd
have been back weeks ago.

697
00:38:02,353 --> 00:38:05,083
Well, you were one reason
I asked for some time here.

698
00:38:05,156 --> 00:38:06,145
Oh, really.

699
00:38:06,224 --> 00:38:07,919
George, the
Riverside Apartments case.

700
00:38:07,992 --> 00:38:09,550
Looks like it
might not be suicide.

701
00:38:09,627 --> 00:38:11,151
Well, shouldn't I be
told about it then?

702
00:38:11,229 --> 00:38:12,594
(Phone ringing)

703
00:38:12,664 --> 00:38:14,894
Frost.

704
00:38:14,966 --> 00:38:16,957
Yes, yes, yes it is.

705
00:38:17,035 --> 00:38:18,229
Yes, all right.

706
00:38:18,303 --> 00:38:20,464
Yes, she is.

707
00:38:20,538 --> 00:38:23,063
All right, thank you Ernie.

708
00:38:23,141 --> 00:38:24,733
That was Ernie Trigg.

709
00:38:24,809 --> 00:38:27,209
He's got something
for you downstairs,

710
00:38:27,278 --> 00:38:28,336
and he says...

711
00:38:28,413 --> 00:38:30,278
You're never
going to believe this.

712
00:38:30,348 --> 00:38:31,440
I've never seen anything...

713
00:38:31,516 --> 00:38:33,541
All right, Ernie,
just try us will you?

714
00:38:33,618 --> 00:38:34,277
All right.

715
00:38:34,352 --> 00:38:36,081
Now, this death at
Riverside Apartments.

716
00:38:36,154 --> 00:38:38,588
It's just been confirmed
as a possible suspicious.

717
00:38:38,656 --> 00:38:39,918
Oh, right.

718
00:38:39,991 --> 00:38:41,288
Well, these are
the fingerprints

719
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,190
taken at the crime
scene by the SOCOS.

720
00:38:43,261 --> 00:38:44,592
Most are the victim's.

721
00:38:44,662 --> 00:38:46,926
A man we think is
called Lester Bryce-Jones.

722
00:38:46,998 --> 00:38:49,023
Yeah, all right,
get the lights, will you?

723
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,694
But this one, FP1 7,

724
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:53,260
that's an unident.

725
00:38:53,338 --> 00:38:54,669
Except, see,

726
00:38:54,739 --> 00:38:56,331
we've got a match.

727
00:38:56,407 --> 00:38:59,501
Prints from our own files.

728
00:38:59,577 --> 00:39:01,477
Identical, right?

729
00:39:01,546 --> 00:39:04,515
Yes, well, that's what
it looks like Ernie.

730
00:39:04,582 --> 00:39:05,947
Whose are these?

731
00:39:06,017 --> 00:39:07,917
Well, that's what you're
not going to believe.

732
00:39:07,986 --> 00:39:10,978
Those prints are from an
old case of yours, Jack.

733
00:39:11,055 --> 00:39:12,716
The Appendix Man?

734
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:14,656
Remember?

735
00:39:16,561 --> 00:39:19,291
The Appendix Man?

736
00:39:19,364 --> 00:39:21,491
Oh, don't be daft.

737
00:39:21,566 --> 00:39:24,262
The Appendix Man
died a year ago.

738
00:39:24,335 --> 00:39:25,632
He was fished
out of the river.

739
00:39:25,703 --> 00:39:27,227
He was drowned,
I know 'cos I was there.

740
00:39:27,305 --> 00:39:28,101
So was I Guv,

741
00:39:28,173 --> 00:39:29,140
Yeah.

742
00:39:29,207 --> 00:39:30,902
And then because we
couldn't identify him

743
00:39:30,975 --> 00:39:33,136
he was stuffed into the
morgue for ten months.

744
00:39:33,211 --> 00:39:35,145
They don't do that
without good reason.

745
00:39:35,213 --> 00:39:36,510
I know that, Jack.

746
00:39:36,581 --> 00:39:40,779
Come on, this is ridiculous.

747
00:39:40,852 --> 00:39:41,876
Are you trying to tell me

748
00:39:41,953 --> 00:39:44,046
that a bloke who
died a year ago

749
00:39:44,122 --> 00:39:45,919
hops out of his coffin,

750
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:48,515
hitches a lift down to
Riverside Apartments,

751
00:39:48,593 --> 00:39:49,617
commits a murder,

752
00:39:49,694 --> 00:39:51,355
then nips back
to the graveyard

753
00:39:51,429 --> 00:39:54,398
probably stopping off at
the Red Lion for a pint?

754
00:39:54,465 --> 00:39:55,898
Well, there it is Jack.

755
00:39:55,967 --> 00:39:58,993
Scientific fact.

756
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,059
He's called
Lester Bryce-Jones,

757
00:40:02,136 --> 00:40:02,966
we think.

758
00:40:03,037 --> 00:40:05,335
But we've
still not established
evidence of identity.

759
00:40:05,406 --> 00:40:07,306
Check banks,
social security,

760
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:08,672
especially hospitals.

761
00:40:08,743 --> 00:40:11,940
Another thing, check
gay clubs and gyms,

762
00:40:12,012 --> 00:40:13,309
he was into exercise.

763
00:40:13,381 --> 00:40:15,941
In more ways
than one, apparently.

764
00:40:16,016 --> 00:40:18,484
(Applause)

765
00:40:18,552 --> 00:40:19,450
Yes, all right, thank you.

766
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,148
Yes, I'm back,
but it's not all good news.

767
00:40:22,223 --> 00:40:25,249
Hornrim Harry is still here.

768
00:40:25,326 --> 00:40:27,760
All right, come on,
let's pay attention.

769
00:40:27,828 --> 00:40:30,695
It appears that
we've got two unidents.

770
00:40:30,765 --> 00:40:32,426
One old one and one new one.

771
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,060
Now, can anyone tell
me do they remember him?

772
00:40:35,136 --> 00:40:36,569
We all do, guv.

773
00:40:36,637 --> 00:40:38,298
Yes, but you
didn't though, did you?

774
00:40:38,372 --> 00:40:39,896
That's The
Appendix Man, right?

775
00:40:39,974 --> 00:40:40,963
Yes, well done, Jordan.

776
00:40:41,041 --> 00:40:42,099
The Appendix Man.

777
00:40:42,176 --> 00:40:45,236
So called because one
Saturday last summer,

778
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,870
when Denton Football club

779
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:48,972
was playing it's
big match at home,

780
00:40:49,049 --> 00:40:52,746
he walked out of Denton
General in a hospital gown

781
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:57,120
even though his appendix
was about to burst.

782
00:40:57,191 --> 00:40:58,886
A few hours later

783
00:40:58,959 --> 00:41:02,451
he was fished out
of the river DED.

784
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:04,498
We thought he
might be a head case.

785
00:41:04,565 --> 00:41:06,760
Yeah, well, we
checked out everything.

786
00:41:06,834 --> 00:41:09,462
Hospital records,
dentistry, fingerprints.

787
00:41:09,537 --> 00:41:11,869
They all came back zero.

788
00:41:11,939 --> 00:41:14,066
Now, is that his
stuff down there?

789
00:41:14,141 --> 00:41:14,903
Yes.

790
00:41:14,975 --> 00:41:17,375
So, we had a
man without a past,

791
00:41:17,445 --> 00:41:20,312
without a present
and without a future.

792
00:41:20,381 --> 00:41:22,212
Everything that
we know about him

793
00:41:22,283 --> 00:41:24,251
is here on this table.

794
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:26,616
Right, so, come and
take a look everybody.

795
00:41:26,687 --> 00:41:28,814
Especially the newcomers.

796
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,784
Right.

797
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:33,224
What have we got.

798
00:41:33,294 --> 00:41:34,261
Hospital gown.

799
00:41:34,328 --> 00:41:37,229
Hospital bracelet
with a number on it,

800
00:41:37,298 --> 00:41:38,094
and his clothes.

801
00:41:38,165 --> 00:41:39,757
All good quality but worn.

802
00:41:39,834 --> 00:41:41,096
Might have been
down on his luck.

803
00:41:41,168 --> 00:41:42,192
Yeah, well, could be.

804
00:41:42,269 --> 00:41:43,327
There was the
driving licence, guv.

805
00:41:43,404 --> 00:41:45,770
Oh yes, and the
driving licence.

806
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,241
Now this driving licence was
found in his jacket pocket

807
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:51,835
and it's in the name
of Colin Drysdale.

808
00:41:51,912 --> 00:41:55,609
But Colin Drysdale
is a local headmaster

809
00:41:55,683 --> 00:42:00,484
who somehow allowed it
to be nicked by a tom.

810
00:42:00,554 --> 00:42:01,680
All right.

811
00:42:01,755 --> 00:42:02,813
So, there you have it.

812
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:05,324
The Appendix Man.

813
00:42:05,392 --> 00:42:06,154
Sorry, sir.

814
00:42:06,227 --> 00:42:07,990
Yes.

815
00:42:08,062 --> 00:42:09,324
I'm new.

816
00:42:09,396 --> 00:42:11,591
Was he the criminal
or the victim?

817
00:42:11,665 --> 00:42:12,689
Neither.

818
00:42:12,766 --> 00:42:13,596
There wasn't a crime,

819
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:15,396
only a mystery.

820
00:42:15,469 --> 00:42:17,198
He died from drowning.

821
00:42:17,271 --> 00:42:19,899
And if he hadn't his appendix
would have killed him.

822
00:42:19,974 --> 00:42:21,271
He could have jumped,

823
00:42:21,342 --> 00:42:23,242
or he could have been pushed.

824
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:25,403
There wasn't a crime then.

825
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:27,606
But there is now.

826
00:42:27,681 --> 00:42:29,649
Because his prints were found

827
00:42:29,717 --> 00:42:32,845
at the Riverside
Apartments crime scene.

828
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,717
Sorry again, sir.

829
00:42:34,788 --> 00:42:36,085
Yes.

830
00:42:36,156 --> 00:42:38,920
But I understood you to
say he died a year ago.

831
00:42:38,993 --> 00:42:41,427
Yes, he did.

832
00:42:41,495 --> 00:42:45,795
But the prints at
the scene were fresh?

833
00:42:45,866 --> 00:42:51,862
Yes they were.

834
00:42:51,939 --> 00:42:54,533
Stand up, what's your name?

835
00:42:54,608 --> 00:42:56,200
PC Martins, sir.

836
00:42:56,277 --> 00:42:58,745
Martins, well done.

837
00:42:58,812 --> 00:43:01,906
Because that's your
problem for today, children.

838
00:43:01,982 --> 00:43:03,711
We've got two unidents.

839
00:43:03,784 --> 00:43:05,115
One died a year ago.

840
00:43:05,185 --> 00:43:07,847
And the other one died
a couple of nights ago.

841
00:43:07,922 --> 00:43:12,484
So how did the phantom
hand of dead male one

842
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:18,556
turn up near the
corpse of dead male two?

843
00:43:18,632 --> 00:43:21,624
Answers on a postcard please.

844
00:43:21,702 --> 00:43:23,169
So, come on let's
get back to work,

845
00:43:23,237 --> 00:43:25,262
chop chop, off we go.

846
00:43:52,633 --> 00:43:54,328
Hello, Darren.

847
00:43:54,401 --> 00:43:55,868
What do you want, Mr. Frost?

848
00:43:55,936 --> 00:43:56,903
I'm not doing nothing.

849
00:43:56,971 --> 00:43:58,598
Well, I'm doing this.

850
00:43:58,672 --> 00:44:00,196
Yeah, so I see.

851
00:44:00,274 --> 00:44:01,935
I wanted you to
remember the last time

852
00:44:02,009 --> 00:44:03,567
you were doing nothing.

853
00:44:03,644 --> 00:44:06,169
When was that then?

854
00:44:06,246 --> 00:44:08,373
It was about a year ago.

855
00:44:08,449 --> 00:44:12,545
When you were living
in the amusement arcade.

856
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:15,680
You bought a stolen
driving licence for a tenner

857
00:44:15,756 --> 00:44:18,190
from a tom
called Nikki Bulmer.

858
00:44:18,258 --> 00:44:19,350
I think you
were just doing

859
00:44:19,426 --> 00:44:21,257
one of your good
turns at the time.

860
00:44:21,328 --> 00:44:22,192
You must think

861
00:44:22,262 --> 00:44:23,786
I've got a memory
like a hippopotamus.

862
00:44:23,864 --> 00:44:26,594
Look, I'm an
uptight citizen now.

863
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:28,464
Mr. Blair's looking after me.

864
00:44:28,535 --> 00:44:29,661
I'm on the new
employment scheme

865
00:44:29,737 --> 00:44:30,704
for young people.

866
00:44:30,771 --> 00:44:32,568
Raising my consciousness.

867
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,902
That's very good, Darren.

868
00:44:33,974 --> 00:44:35,202
How high is it now?

869
00:44:35,275 --> 00:44:36,799
Pretty high.

870
00:44:36,877 --> 00:44:38,401
I told you
everything at the time.

871
00:44:38,479 --> 00:44:40,572
I definitely recall that.

872
00:44:40,648 --> 00:44:42,673
You blagged like a villain.

873
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,843
Mr. Frost, that's a cliche.

874
00:44:44,918 --> 00:44:46,249
You remember what I said.

875
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,378
There was a drugs bust,

876
00:44:47,454 --> 00:44:49,149
I dropped the
licence on the floor.

877
00:44:49,223 --> 00:44:52,090
That's what I said
last time, isn't it?

878
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:55,151
Tell me something Darren,

879
00:44:55,229 --> 00:44:59,461
if there hadn't
been a drugs bust,

880
00:44:59,533 --> 00:45:03,492
how would you have got rid
of that driver's licence?

881
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:06,004
I mean you must have
known someone who'd take it,

882
00:45:06,073 --> 00:45:08,132
someone who'd move it on.

883
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:10,733
Come on, you can
tell me, can't you?

884
00:45:10,811 --> 00:45:12,711
Come on, you want
Mr. Blair to be proud of you.

885
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,111
All right, all right, look.

886
00:45:14,181 --> 00:45:16,581
There's that arty club
up on Felix Street.

887
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:17,639
The Cave Club.

888
00:45:17,718 --> 00:45:19,015
The barman there
sells stuff like that

889
00:45:19,086 --> 00:45:20,383
right over the counter.

890
00:45:26,193 --> 00:45:28,661
Glasgow today is such
a fashionable subject,

891
00:45:28,729 --> 00:45:30,162
is it not?

892
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:33,427
And in contemporary painting
it helps to be Scottish,

893
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,297
don't you think?

894
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:38,099
That's two thousand
five hundred,

895
00:45:38,172 --> 00:45:41,403
and the big oil is four.

896
00:45:44,078 --> 00:45:45,739
Excuse me a moment.

897
00:45:45,813 --> 00:45:47,474
Can I help you at all?

898
00:45:47,548 --> 00:45:48,742
Yeah, yeah.

899
00:45:50,751 --> 00:45:52,116
Yeah.

900
00:45:52,186 --> 00:45:54,552
You can tell me
about these paintings.

901
00:45:56,056 --> 00:45:57,523
Well,

902
00:45:57,591 --> 00:45:58,853
the first thing I can tell you

903
00:45:58,926 --> 00:46:00,917
is they're not paintings.

904
00:46:00,994 --> 00:46:02,393
Prints.

905
00:46:02,463 --> 00:46:04,090
Etchings in fact.

906
00:46:04,164 --> 00:46:06,189
Are they valuable?

907
00:46:06,266 --> 00:46:08,632
It depends on your standards.

908
00:46:08,702 --> 00:46:11,637
Possibly the lower hundreds.

909
00:46:11,705 --> 00:46:14,606
Is there any way
of tracing their, um...

910
00:46:14,675 --> 00:46:15,937
Provenance?

911
00:46:16,009 --> 00:46:16,771
Yeah.

912
00:46:16,844 --> 00:46:18,277
Not easy to say.

913
00:46:18,345 --> 00:46:21,781
Paintings by leading artists
are generally catalogued.

914
00:46:21,849 --> 00:46:23,180
Lesser work like this

915
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:25,844
usually ends up with
the smaller collector.

916
00:46:25,919 --> 00:46:29,411
Then they could
have been nicked?

917
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:32,755
In that case wouldn't
they be known to the police?

918
00:46:32,826 --> 00:46:35,989
If you do come across
anything about them,

919
00:46:36,063 --> 00:46:39,123
would you mind
giving us a call?

920
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:42,396
That's my provenance.

921
00:46:42,469 --> 00:46:44,630
Denton CID.

922
00:46:48,809 --> 00:46:49,537
Goodbye.

923
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:50,975
Thanks.

924
00:47:05,492 --> 00:47:06,516
Here.

925
00:47:07,728 --> 00:47:10,492
Someone told me
something about you.

926
00:47:10,564 --> 00:47:14,125
Said if I needed
to change my life,

927
00:47:14,201 --> 00:47:17,329
you could help me out.

928
00:47:17,404 --> 00:47:20,134
How can I help you out?

929
00:47:20,207 --> 00:47:24,234
This person said
you might be able to

930
00:47:24,311 --> 00:47:26,176
fit me up with new papers,

931
00:47:26,246 --> 00:47:27,178
driving licence.

932
00:47:27,247 --> 00:47:29,442
That sort of thing.

933
00:47:29,516 --> 00:47:30,642
I think you're fitting me up.

934
00:47:30,717 --> 00:47:32,150
Who said that?

935
00:47:32,219 --> 00:47:34,278
Well, I don't know who it was,

936
00:47:34,354 --> 00:47:36,185
because I talk to a
lot of people, you see.

937
00:47:36,256 --> 00:47:40,750
Cause I'm a policeman,
from Denton CID.

938
00:47:40,828 --> 00:47:42,819
Got all the papers you
want then, haven't you?

939
00:47:42,896 --> 00:47:45,126
I've got some more here.

940
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:47,565
I'd like you to
have a look at.

941
00:47:47,634 --> 00:47:50,068
Have you ever seen
this bloke before.

942
00:47:50,137 --> 00:47:51,798
Has he ever been in here.

943
00:47:51,872 --> 00:47:53,032
A while ago.

944
00:47:53,106 --> 00:47:54,937
Never seen him in my life.

945
00:47:55,008 --> 00:47:56,771
All right, hey, just a minute.

946
00:47:56,844 --> 00:47:58,072
I haven't finished yet.

947
00:47:58,145 --> 00:48:00,079
Come here.

948
00:48:00,147 --> 00:48:04,106
So you wouldn't have sold
him this driving licence?

949
00:48:04,184 --> 00:48:05,344
About a year ago,

950
00:48:05,419 --> 00:48:06,215
Iook at the name,

951
00:48:06,286 --> 00:48:08,049
Colin Drysdale.

952
00:48:08,121 --> 00:48:09,213
No, I didn't.

953
00:48:09,289 --> 00:48:11,257
Now don't you tell me porkies,

954
00:48:11,325 --> 00:48:13,555
because I know you
bought this driving licence

955
00:48:13,627 --> 00:48:16,027
off a young tearaway
called Darren Matthews.

956
00:48:16,096 --> 00:48:18,826
Don't tell me that you
didn't try to sell it on.

957
00:48:18,899 --> 00:48:20,924
Not to him I didn't.

958
00:48:21,001 --> 00:48:22,400
Right

959
00:48:22,469 --> 00:48:23,902
Mr. Frost!

960
00:48:23,971 --> 00:48:25,632
So you're a free man then?

961
00:48:25,706 --> 00:48:26,468
What?

962
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:28,303
I'd no idea you came here.

963
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:30,639
Donald's joining me later.

964
00:48:30,711 --> 00:48:32,372
Care for a cocktail?

965
00:48:32,446 --> 00:48:33,879
Oh, yeah.

966
00:48:33,947 --> 00:48:35,278
I see what you're saying.

967
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:36,976
Not now, thanks very much.

968
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:38,608
I've got to dash.

969
00:48:38,685 --> 00:48:40,084
Perhaps another time.

970
00:48:48,262 --> 00:48:49,786
Excuse me?

971
00:48:49,863 --> 00:48:51,831
We're making
enquiries about a murder.

972
00:48:51,899 --> 00:48:53,264
Wondered if you
knew who he is?

973
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:54,527
He could have
worked here once.

974
00:48:54,601 --> 00:48:55,932
Yeah, course he did.

975
00:48:56,003 --> 00:48:57,527
Casualty porter.

976
00:48:57,604 --> 00:48:58,764
Well, who is he, then?

977
00:48:58,839 --> 00:49:00,932
That's, Les.

978
00:49:01,008 --> 00:49:01,997
Les for Lester?

979
00:49:02,075 --> 00:49:03,099
Lester Bryce-Jones?

980
00:49:03,176 --> 00:49:04,803
Les for Leslie.

981
00:49:04,878 --> 00:49:07,073
Leslie Jackson.

982
00:49:07,147 --> 00:49:09,377
Leslie, Leslie...

983
00:49:14,855 --> 00:49:16,516
Leslie Jackson.

984
00:49:19,192 --> 00:49:20,955
You could be in luck.

985
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:33,866
Listen, I've had a thought.

986
00:49:33,941 --> 00:49:36,501
Maybe the
Appendix Man was gay.

987
00:49:36,576 --> 00:49:37,770
Leslie Jackson was.

988
00:49:37,844 --> 00:49:39,072
Who?

989
00:49:39,146 --> 00:49:43,810
Lester Bryce-Jones
was also Leslie Jackson.

990
00:49:43,884 --> 00:49:45,283
Let's see.

991
00:49:45,352 --> 00:49:47,013
Leslie Peter Jackson,

992
00:49:47,087 --> 00:49:48,987
born 1960 Perth.

993
00:49:49,056 --> 00:49:50,284
Check him out
with Scottish police.

994
00:49:50,357 --> 00:49:51,654
Not a lot of use, George.

995
00:49:51,725 --> 00:49:53,317
This is Perth,
Western Australia.

996
00:49:53,393 --> 00:49:54,724
Australian police then.

997
00:49:54,795 --> 00:49:55,727
There's an address here,

998
00:49:55,796 --> 00:49:56,922
Infirmary Road.

999
00:49:56,997 --> 00:49:58,294
Before he moved to
Riverside Apartments.

1000
00:49:58,365 --> 00:50:00,560
But I'm going to get
PC Martins to check it out.

1001
00:50:00,634 --> 00:50:01,760
Good.

1002
00:50:01,835 --> 00:50:05,032
He went to the Captain
Cook High School, Perth.

1003
00:50:05,105 --> 00:50:06,265
And then medical orderly

1004
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,604
at the Les Patterson
General Hospital.

1005
00:50:13,447 --> 00:50:14,072
Don't tell me.

1006
00:50:14,147 --> 00:50:15,205
Don't tell me.

1007
00:50:15,282 --> 00:50:16,442
He then went on

1008
00:50:16,516 --> 00:50:19,349
to the Edna Everage
State University?

1009
00:50:19,419 --> 00:50:20,613
No he didn't.

1010
00:50:20,687 --> 00:50:21,346
What?

1011
00:50:21,421 --> 00:50:22,183
Come on,

1012
00:50:22,255 --> 00:50:25,747
Les Patterson's a
character invented by an
actor, Barry Humphreys...

1013
00:50:25,826 --> 00:50:27,487
Oh... sod.

1014
00:50:27,561 --> 00:50:28,619
He's made all this stuff up?

1015
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:30,026
I'm afraid so, love, yes.

1016
00:50:30,097 --> 00:50:31,564
He's probably not
even Leslie Jackson.

1017
00:50:31,631 --> 00:50:33,997
No, I wouldn't
have thought so.

1018
00:50:34,067 --> 00:50:35,034
Hazel, come on,

1019
00:50:35,102 --> 00:50:36,126
don't worry about it.

1020
00:50:36,203 --> 00:50:37,135
Happens to us all.

1021
00:50:37,204 --> 00:50:38,364
I tell you what,

1022
00:50:38,438 --> 00:50:42,397
I'd like you to show me
these Riverside Apartments.

1023
00:50:42,476 --> 00:50:43,500
Come on, let's go.

1024
00:50:43,577 --> 00:50:44,407
Thanks George.

1025
00:50:44,478 --> 00:50:45,570
All right.

1026
00:50:55,722 --> 00:50:57,485
Body was over here, guv.

1027
00:50:57,557 --> 00:50:58,922
Oh yes?

1028
00:51:01,895 --> 00:51:03,760
The Appendix
Man's fingerprints

1029
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:06,765
were on a whiskey
glass on this table.

1030
00:51:06,833 --> 00:51:08,528
Ah, I tell you what.

1031
00:51:08,602 --> 00:51:10,570
You could make us
both a cup of coffee.

1032
00:51:10,637 --> 00:51:12,605
Guv, I thought you'd
come to see a crime scene.

1033
00:51:12,672 --> 00:51:14,902
Yes, but the golden
rule at a crime scene

1034
00:51:14,975 --> 00:51:16,067
is always check the things

1035
00:51:16,143 --> 00:51:17,633
that other people
haven't bothered with.

1036
00:51:17,711 --> 00:51:20,202
Everything was
checked thoroughly.

1037
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,542
Was it.

1038
00:51:21,615 --> 00:51:23,014
Good.

1039
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:24,641
That means that
someone's check

1040
00:51:24,718 --> 00:51:27,744
the Saint Martin's
School of Art?

1041
00:51:27,821 --> 00:51:28,719
They should have done

1042
00:51:28,789 --> 00:51:30,882
because this book was
borrowed four years ago

1043
00:51:30,957 --> 00:51:32,686
Mr. Mullet's going to
have one hell of a fine

1044
00:51:32,759 --> 00:51:34,420
if someone doesn't
return it soon.

1045
00:51:34,494 --> 00:51:35,927
And while you're at it,

1046
00:51:35,996 --> 00:51:38,191
see if you can find out
the name of the borrower.

1047
00:51:38,265 --> 00:51:40,631
See if he did an art
course there in '94,

1048
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,190
also see if his name

1049
00:51:42,269 --> 00:51:45,067
could possibly have
been Lionel Jacques.

1050
00:51:45,138 --> 00:51:45,866
All right.

1051
00:51:45,939 --> 00:51:48,032
Now then, tell me something?

1052
00:51:48,108 --> 00:51:51,339
These paintings,
any good are they.

1053
00:51:51,411 --> 00:51:53,641
I'm a Stag at Bay man myself.

1054
00:51:53,713 --> 00:51:54,805
It seems it's
collector's stuff.

1055
00:51:54,881 --> 00:51:56,644
It's worth a few thousand.

1056
00:51:56,716 --> 00:51:58,183
Really?

1057
00:51:58,251 --> 00:52:01,743
Well, not bad for a
hospital porter then, is it?

1058
00:52:01,822 --> 00:52:04,086
I suppose you've checked
with the Art Squad, have you?

1059
00:52:04,157 --> 00:52:06,057
Haven't come up with anything.

1060
00:52:06,126 --> 00:52:06,990
Oh, yeah.

1061
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:09,528
Now is anything missing?

1062
00:52:09,596 --> 00:52:12,565
Because if it is murder
it helps to have a motive.

1063
00:52:12,632 --> 00:52:13,428
Could be something missing.

1064
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,489
How would we know?

1065
00:52:14,568 --> 00:52:15,933
Ah, yes well there's the rub.

1066
00:52:16,002 --> 00:52:18,493
I tell you what,
if it is murder how
did the killer get in,

1067
00:52:18,572 --> 00:52:20,597
because you said that the
front door was locked?

1068
00:52:20,674 --> 00:52:22,403
Yes, but the veranda
doors were open.

1069
00:52:22,476 --> 00:52:24,307
Oh, were they?

1070
00:52:35,188 --> 00:52:37,713
Oh, look it's a cat flap.

1071
00:52:37,791 --> 00:52:40,225
Come on puss, come in.

1072
00:52:40,293 --> 00:52:41,988
There you go.

1073
00:52:42,062 --> 00:52:44,963
Hey I thought you were making
us two a cup of coffee?

1074
00:52:45,031 --> 00:52:45,929
Forget what you take, guv.

1075
00:52:45,999 --> 00:52:46,966
One lump or two.

1076
00:52:47,033 --> 00:52:48,227
Two.

1077
00:52:56,910 --> 00:52:59,674
(Talking)

1078
00:53:09,723 --> 00:53:13,557
What do you think about all
these other keys then, pussy?

1079
00:53:13,627 --> 00:53:16,255
What do you think
about all of them?

1080
00:53:16,329 --> 00:53:17,318
They've been checked too.

1081
00:53:17,397 --> 00:53:18,989
The Yales fit the apartment.

1082
00:53:19,065 --> 00:53:20,396
Yeah.

1083
00:53:20,467 --> 00:53:21,695
But these don't, do they?

1084
00:53:21,768 --> 00:53:22,666
No, guv.

1085
00:53:22,736 --> 00:53:24,465
No.

1086
00:53:24,538 --> 00:53:25,505
Do you know what I think?

1087
00:53:25,572 --> 00:53:27,506
I think if you can't find
any of his paperwork,

1088
00:53:27,574 --> 00:53:28,541
or his passport,

1089
00:53:28,608 --> 00:53:29,597
anything like that,

1090
00:53:29,676 --> 00:53:30,904
that may mean

1091
00:53:30,977 --> 00:53:33,878
that he's got a place
somewhere else, you know.

1092
00:54:14,554 --> 00:54:15,919
It's all right,
dear, it's all right.

1093
00:54:15,989 --> 00:54:17,752
It's all been cleared up.

1094
00:54:17,824 --> 00:54:20,019
Okay.

1095
00:54:20,093 --> 00:54:23,585
Now then, you
came in with the key.

1096
00:54:23,663 --> 00:54:24,960
So what did you see?

1097
00:54:25,031 --> 00:54:25,929
Just take me through it.

1098
00:54:25,999 --> 00:54:27,864
You were looking
for the cat, yes?

1099
00:54:27,934 --> 00:54:28,832
Yes.

1100
00:54:28,902 --> 00:54:29,960
Actually I liked
it when he's away.

1101
00:54:30,036 --> 00:54:32,527
Feeding the cat gave
me something to do.

1102
00:54:32,606 --> 00:54:33,436
Just tell me,

1103
00:54:33,506 --> 00:54:34,996
what did you see

1104
00:54:35,075 --> 00:54:39,205
before you found poor
Mr. Bryce-Jones?

1105
00:54:39,279 --> 00:54:42,146
I saw pills on the table.

1106
00:54:42,215 --> 00:54:43,910
Some on the floor.

1107
00:54:43,984 --> 00:54:47,852
Then the cat was
yowling and then I saw...

1108
00:54:47,921 --> 00:54:50,321
Yes, yes, of course.

1109
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:52,449
Just think back Leonie.

1110
00:54:52,525 --> 00:54:54,789
When you first came in.

1111
00:54:54,861 --> 00:54:56,260
Was anything missing?

1112
00:54:56,329 --> 00:54:59,196
The picture, you mean.

1113
00:54:59,266 --> 00:55:01,393
Yes, most probably.

1114
00:55:01,468 --> 00:55:04,130
So, go on.

1115
00:55:04,204 --> 00:55:06,536
When I came home from
school the door was open.

1116
00:55:06,606 --> 00:55:08,801
There was a painting
on the easel there.

1117
00:55:08,875 --> 00:55:10,843
Then when I came for
Shangri it had gone.

1118
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:14,971
(Phone ringing)

1119
00:55:15,048 --> 00:55:17,175
Do you know much
about painting, Leonie?

1120
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:17,978
Not a lot.

1121
00:55:18,051 --> 00:55:20,042
But I think it was a Hockney.

1122
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,917
A Hockney?

1123
00:55:21,988 --> 00:55:23,512
Are you sure?

1124
00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:24,784
Well, it had to be, didn't it?

1125
00:55:24,858 --> 00:55:26,155
It had a swimming pool in it.

1126
00:55:26,226 --> 00:55:27,056
Right, thanks.

1127
00:55:27,127 --> 00:55:28,651
Just stay where you are,
we'll be right over.

1128
00:55:28,728 --> 00:55:29,456
Guv.

1129
00:55:29,529 --> 00:55:30,928
That address
in Infirmary Road.

1130
00:55:30,997 --> 00:55:31,964
Someone's been using it.

1131
00:55:32,032 --> 00:55:34,364
A man in a hospital coat.

1132
00:55:34,434 --> 00:55:35,765
Really?

1133
00:55:35,835 --> 00:55:36,426
Thank you.

1134
00:55:36,503 --> 00:55:38,403
Thank you very much, Leonie.

1135
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:43,236
The neighbors say
he comes quite often.

1136
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:44,902
You know, picks
up mail and stuff.

1137
00:55:44,978 --> 00:55:46,002
All right.

1138
00:55:49,549 --> 00:55:51,346
Aha.

1139
00:56:00,994 --> 00:56:01,824
Look at this, guv.

1140
00:56:01,895 --> 00:56:02,759
What?

1141
00:56:02,829 --> 00:56:04,854
Addressed to
Mr. Leslie Jackson.

1142
00:56:04,931 --> 00:56:06,023
Right.

1143
00:56:06,099 --> 00:56:07,031
Call for backup.

1144
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:09,034
I want this whole
place searched.

1145
00:56:09,102 --> 00:56:11,002
Alpha bravo 16 to Control?

1146
00:56:32,726 --> 00:56:34,353
Hazel!

1147
00:56:37,964 --> 00:56:40,159
Oh, thank you.

1148
00:56:40,233 --> 00:56:41,700
Mr. Frost,

1149
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,025
you might have said.

1150
00:56:43,102 --> 00:56:44,763
You're not one, are you?

1151
00:56:47,273 --> 00:56:49,332
Not one what?

1152
00:56:49,408 --> 00:56:50,932
Not a policeman.

1153
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:52,409
The barman at the
Cave Club told me...

1154
00:56:52,478 --> 00:56:54,946
Yes, only in the afternoons.

1155
00:56:55,014 --> 00:56:57,676
And you shouldn't listen
to gossip, should you.

1156
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:59,615
And you always seemed so nice.

1157
00:56:59,685 --> 00:57:00,913
Yeah, well.

1158
00:57:03,022 --> 00:57:05,786
Yeah, talking
about that Cave Club.

1159
00:57:05,858 --> 00:57:08,122
Is it a good place
to meet people, is it?

1160
00:57:08,194 --> 00:57:09,388
I should hope so,

1161
00:57:09,462 --> 00:57:11,089
that's what it's for.

1162
00:57:14,333 --> 00:57:16,096
Did you ever see him there?

1163
00:57:19,205 --> 00:57:20,433
No.

1164
00:57:20,506 --> 00:57:22,497
I've never seen
him before in my life.

1165
00:57:22,575 --> 00:57:24,668
Is he a friend of yours?

1166
00:57:24,744 --> 00:57:25,836
No not really.

1167
00:57:25,911 --> 00:57:27,811
I never knew him
when he was alive.

1168
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:30,576
Now no-one seems to know
him now that he's dead.

1169
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:34,177
Oh dear, is he?

1170
00:57:34,253 --> 00:57:37,552
Found drowned in a
river about a year ago.

1171
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:41,624
What about this one?

1172
00:57:41,694 --> 00:57:43,389
Have you ever seen him there?

1173
00:57:43,462 --> 00:57:45,828
His name's Leslie Jackson.

1174
00:57:45,898 --> 00:57:47,593
Now him I'm not sure.

1175
00:57:47,667 --> 00:57:50,397
I think I just might have.

1176
00:57:50,469 --> 00:57:52,630
I'll go and ask
Donald, all right?

1177
00:57:52,705 --> 00:57:54,798
Yes, please do, Brian.

1178
00:58:00,913 --> 00:58:02,380
Yes?

1179
00:58:08,954 --> 00:58:10,046
Sorry, Mr. Frost.

1180
00:58:10,122 --> 00:58:12,716
Donald says nice
man but definitely no.

1181
00:58:12,792 --> 00:58:13,486
Oh, right.

1182
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:15,049
Thank you for trying Brian.

1183
00:58:15,127 --> 00:58:16,287
Could I have
another pot of tea?

1184
00:58:16,362 --> 00:58:18,523
Of course you can, Inspector.

1185
00:58:30,743 --> 00:58:32,040
Morning, Jack.

1186
00:58:32,111 --> 00:58:33,908
Morning Harry.

1187
00:58:33,979 --> 00:58:36,504
I've had ten quid's worth
on pump number three.

1188
00:58:36,582 --> 00:58:37,446
There you go.

1189
00:58:37,516 --> 00:58:38,380
Do you want a
receipt for that?

1190
00:58:38,451 --> 00:58:39,440
Yes please.

1191
00:58:39,518 --> 00:58:40,985
And I want one of these,

1192
00:58:41,053 --> 00:58:42,350
a Chicken Duchesse

1193
00:58:42,421 --> 00:58:45,913
with a light curry
sauce on wholemeal.

1194
00:58:45,991 --> 00:58:48,118
That's expired, I see.

1195
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:53,120
Here, you couldn't
let me have twenty or so

1196
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:55,326
of those blank
receipts could you?

1197
00:58:55,401 --> 00:58:58,461
You'd be helping me out
with a very important case.

1198
00:58:58,537 --> 00:59:00,004
Yeah, course I can Jack.

1199
00:59:00,072 --> 00:59:00,868
You're a good man.

1200
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:02,271
And the sarnie's on the house.

1201
00:59:02,341 --> 00:59:03,774
Oh, cheers.

1202
00:59:12,017 --> 00:59:13,644
I've seen his Bank Manager.

1203
00:59:13,719 --> 00:59:15,277
Guess how much in his account?

1204
00:59:15,354 --> 00:59:18,551
Twenty five thousand.

1205
00:59:18,624 --> 00:59:20,819
Maybe I should be
a hospital porter.

1206
00:59:20,893 --> 00:59:21,860
Maybe.

1207
00:59:23,195 --> 00:59:25,186
Anything from
St. Martin's School of Art?

1208
00:59:25,264 --> 00:59:25,992
Yes.

1209
00:59:26,065 --> 00:59:27,965
He was known as
Lionel Jacobs there.

1210
00:59:28,033 --> 00:59:30,263
Enrolled autumn 1993,

1211
00:59:30,336 --> 00:59:32,099
and then quit after Christmas.

1212
00:59:32,171 --> 00:59:33,229
He took a course in...

1213
00:59:33,305 --> 00:59:34,738
Basket-weaving?

1214
00:59:34,807 --> 00:59:35,865
Not at all.

1215
00:59:35,941 --> 00:59:37,101
Figure drawing.

1216
00:59:37,176 --> 00:59:38,200
Did quite well.

1217
00:59:38,277 --> 00:59:41,508
He said he came from
Brisbane in Australia.

1218
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:43,013
So that's Perth, now Brisbane.

1219
00:59:43,082 --> 00:59:44,572
I bet he came from Sydney.

1220
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:45,742
Unless it was Melbourne.

1221
00:59:45,818 --> 00:59:47,547
What about Adelaide?

1222
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:48,609
Anyone seen Jack Frost?

1223
00:59:48,687 --> 00:59:49,779
No.

1224
00:59:49,855 --> 00:59:51,379
Only Mr. Mullett's
getting a bit rattled.

1225
00:59:51,457 --> 00:59:52,788
He wants things
tidying up quick.

1226
00:59:52,858 --> 00:59:53,688
What's the news?

1227
00:59:53,759 --> 00:59:55,192
Well, he's got another
interview on Wednesday.

1228
00:59:55,261 --> 00:59:56,785
So, fingers crossed.

1229
00:59:56,862 --> 00:59:58,557
Ok, thanks very much.

1230
00:59:58,631 --> 00:59:59,723
Art squad.

1231
00:59:59,799 --> 01:00:01,164
They need a
detailed description

1232
01:00:01,233 --> 01:00:02,632
on those paintings.

1233
01:00:02,701 --> 01:00:05,192
But they do say
there was a Hockney

1234
01:00:05,271 --> 01:00:07,705
among the pictures
stolen from Black Farm.

1235
01:00:07,773 --> 01:00:10,571
Pity Jack's lost
the file, isn't it?

1236
01:00:17,917 --> 01:00:20,784
Yeah, that's nice.

1237
01:00:20,853 --> 01:00:23,185
I feel better already.

1238
01:00:23,255 --> 01:00:25,223
That's because I'm
giving you deep healing

1239
01:00:25,291 --> 01:00:27,384
along with the massage.

1240
01:00:30,296 --> 01:00:32,457
Got many clients, have you?

1241
01:00:32,531 --> 01:00:35,989
A lot of corporate ones, yes.

1242
01:00:36,068 --> 01:00:39,560
I've heard it
changes people's lives.

1243
01:00:39,638 --> 01:00:43,699
We've helped a lot of
people discover themselves.

1244
01:00:49,248 --> 01:00:52,979
Trouble with me is
I'm always so busy.

1245
01:00:57,890 --> 01:01:00,017
There.

1246
01:01:00,092 --> 01:01:01,650
Well, if you
can't find a window,

1247
01:01:01,727 --> 01:01:03,319
I can always give you
a twenty minute massage

1248
01:01:03,395 --> 01:01:04,828
at your desk.

1249
01:01:04,897 --> 01:01:08,264
Assuming you've
got a quiet desk.

1250
01:01:08,334 --> 01:01:10,859
Would you like me to
take your business number?

1251
01:01:10,936 --> 01:01:12,130
Yes.

1252
01:01:12,204 --> 01:01:13,171
Yeah, I would.

1253
01:01:13,239 --> 01:01:15,298
That's a very good idea.

1254
01:01:15,374 --> 01:01:16,864
There it is.

1255
01:01:16,942 --> 01:01:17,738
Oh no.

1256
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:20,108
Not here too.

1257
01:01:20,179 --> 01:01:21,203
Morning, Gaynor.

1258
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,542
Just go through and undress,

1259
01:01:22,615 --> 01:01:25,277
I'll be with you in a minute.

1260
01:01:25,351 --> 01:01:28,184
I am busy, as you can see.

1261
01:01:28,254 --> 01:01:31,121
Yes, nice work
if you can get it.

1262
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:33,522
I assume this is about
the man across the hall?

1263
01:01:33,592 --> 01:01:34,991
Lester Bryce-Jones.

1264
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:36,960
Yes, if that
was his real name.

1265
01:01:37,029 --> 01:01:40,556
He seems to be using
quite a lot of names recently.

1266
01:01:40,633 --> 01:01:41,565
Did he?

1267
01:01:41,634 --> 01:01:42,464
I wouldn't know.

1268
01:01:42,534 --> 01:01:44,525
I knew very little about him.

1269
01:01:44,603 --> 01:01:48,664
That'll be fifteen
pounds please.

1270
01:01:48,741 --> 01:01:49,503
Yes.

1271
01:01:49,575 --> 01:01:50,633
All right.

1272
01:01:52,711 --> 01:01:55,475
Your daughter, Leonie
has been very helpful.

1273
01:01:55,547 --> 01:01:56,775
Yes I know.

1274
01:01:56,849 --> 01:01:59,044
She's also very upset.

1275
01:01:59,118 --> 01:02:01,018
Isn't it time
you left her alone?

1276
01:02:01,086 --> 01:02:03,054
She's a very clever girl.

1277
01:02:03,122 --> 01:02:05,420
Does she know a
lot about modern art?

1278
01:02:05,491 --> 01:02:06,480
About art?

1279
01:02:06,558 --> 01:02:09,425
Not much, she's only fifteen.

1280
01:02:09,495 --> 01:02:11,053
So you would say
that she wouldn't know

1281
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:14,429
the difference between
a hockeystick and a Hockney?

1282
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:17,162
A Hockney?

1283
01:02:17,236 --> 01:02:19,136
She reckons that she
saw a Hockney painting

1284
01:02:19,204 --> 01:02:21,468
in Lester Bryce's
flat that afternoon.

1285
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:24,873
Did she?

1286
01:02:24,944 --> 01:02:27,538
Only it isn't there now.

1287
01:02:27,613 --> 01:02:29,342
Yes, well, I'd say
that's about as likely

1288
01:02:29,415 --> 01:02:30,746
as seeing the
Royal Yacht Britannia

1289
01:02:30,816 --> 01:02:32,681
in the Denton River,
wouldn't you?

1290
01:02:32,751 --> 01:02:34,241
Leonie is smart,

1291
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,447
but I wouldn't trust
her with your investments.

1292
01:02:36,522 --> 01:02:39,218
Now, can you see
your own way out?

1293
01:03:02,414 --> 01:03:03,108
Ah, Frost.

1294
01:03:03,182 --> 01:03:03,876
Ah, sir.

1295
01:03:03,949 --> 01:03:05,610
Very glad to hear you've
got another interview.

1296
01:03:05,684 --> 01:03:07,413
I want you in my
office immediately.

1297
01:03:07,486 --> 01:03:08,248
I'm just on my way...

1298
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:09,446
Whatever it is, it can wait.

1299
01:03:09,521 --> 01:03:10,510
The Black Farm murder can't.

1300
01:03:10,589 --> 01:03:11,681
I've got the
press all over me.

1301
01:03:11,757 --> 01:03:12,781
Now, have you found that file?

1302
01:03:12,858 --> 01:03:13,984
I'm still looking for it.

1303
01:03:14,059 --> 01:03:14,923
And I want your time sheets.

1304
01:03:14,994 --> 01:03:16,052
And your petrol expenses.

1305
01:03:16,128 --> 01:03:17,186
And your report on
the Riverside Murder.

1306
01:03:17,262 --> 01:03:19,287
And what's all this
about The Appendix Man?

1307
01:03:19,365 --> 01:03:20,229
Good morning, sir.

1308
01:03:20,299 --> 01:03:21,266
Good morning.

1309
01:03:21,333 --> 01:03:22,197
Just bringing your coffee.

1310
01:03:22,267 --> 01:03:23,029
Yes, sir.

1311
01:03:23,102 --> 01:03:23,932
Shall I take it upstairs?

1312
01:03:24,003 --> 01:03:25,834
Yes, please do yes,
thank you Sergeant Brady.

1313
01:03:25,904 --> 01:03:27,337
Well?

1314
01:03:30,376 --> 01:03:31,274
I tell you Jack,

1315
01:03:31,343 --> 01:03:33,004
no way those prints are wrong.

1316
01:03:33,078 --> 01:03:36,104
Crossed checked
in the old faithful.

1317
01:03:36,181 --> 01:03:38,240
Yes, but, hang on.

1318
01:03:38,317 --> 01:03:41,377
Not all of those prints
are ours, are they?

1319
01:03:41,453 --> 01:03:46,447
The Appendix Man's came
from the Pathology lab.

1320
01:03:46,525 --> 01:03:47,890
Because that's
where they took him

1321
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,951
when he came out of the river.

1322
01:03:50,029 --> 01:03:51,428
You know Jack,
it would help a lot

1323
01:03:51,497 --> 01:03:52,964
if you didn't
lose all your files.

1324
01:03:53,032 --> 01:03:54,693
Yeah.

1325
01:03:54,767 --> 01:03:56,894
I don't know though.

1326
01:03:56,969 --> 01:03:58,698
Here, have a sandwich.

1327
01:03:58,771 --> 01:04:00,534
Thanks for the tea.

1328
01:04:12,351 --> 01:04:13,147
Morning, doc.

1329
01:04:13,218 --> 01:04:14,344
Remember me?

1330
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:16,012
All too well.

1331
01:04:16,088 --> 01:04:18,989
I thought you'd
retired from the force.

1332
01:04:19,058 --> 01:04:20,923
Suddenly life seemed
far more pleasant.

1333
01:04:20,993 --> 01:04:23,860
Oh, just for once
this isn't one of yours.

1334
01:04:23,929 --> 01:04:24,588
Really?

1335
01:04:24,663 --> 01:04:26,426
Who are you doing
it for, a friend?

1336
01:04:26,498 --> 01:04:27,487
Knife?

1337
01:04:30,769 --> 01:04:31,701
What is it, Inspector?

1338
01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:35,103
Ah, do you remember
the Appendix Man?

1339
01:04:35,174 --> 01:04:37,074
How could I ever forget him?

1340
01:04:37,142 --> 01:04:38,666
Never identified him, did you?

1341
01:04:38,744 --> 01:04:41,008
Which is why he slept
in the morgue for so long.

1342
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:42,308
Well, he's not
there now, is he?

1343
01:04:42,381 --> 01:04:43,370
No, he's not there now.

1344
01:04:43,449 --> 01:04:44,939
He went to an unmarked grave.

1345
01:04:45,017 --> 01:04:46,678
You signed the
request to the coroner.

1346
01:04:46,752 --> 01:04:47,650
Yes, I know.

1347
01:04:47,719 --> 01:04:49,653
And now I've got
to dig him up.

1348
01:04:49,721 --> 01:04:50,745
I beg your pardon?

1349
01:04:50,823 --> 01:04:52,620
We're reopening the case.

1350
01:04:52,691 --> 01:04:54,352
There never was a case.

1351
01:04:54,426 --> 01:04:56,155
The man had every
right to leave hospital

1352
01:04:56,228 --> 01:04:57,320
if he wanted to,

1353
01:04:57,396 --> 01:04:59,193
however foolish
he might have been.

1354
01:04:59,264 --> 01:05:00,390
As for his death,

1355
01:05:00,466 --> 01:05:02,024
he drowned
himself, didn't he?

1356
01:05:02,101 --> 01:05:04,194
I would if I was
in that kind of pain.

1357
01:05:04,269 --> 01:05:06,396
The truth is doc,

1358
01:05:06,472 --> 01:05:09,100
it's all rather embarrassing.

1359
01:05:09,174 --> 01:05:10,163
But they've gone

1360
01:05:10,242 --> 01:05:15,373
and lost your original
pathology report.

1361
01:05:15,447 --> 01:05:17,244
So I thought
I'd just pop in here

1362
01:05:17,316 --> 01:05:20,843
and see if you've got
a copy in your files.

1363
01:05:20,919 --> 01:05:21,886
Diana.

1364
01:05:21,954 --> 01:05:25,117
Will you see what you can
do for this impossible man?

1365
01:05:25,190 --> 01:05:26,452
Thank you.

1366
01:05:33,098 --> 01:05:34,497
DC Jordan?

1367
01:05:34,566 --> 01:05:37,467
Joanna Kenwothy
at Ansty Galleries.

1368
01:05:37,536 --> 01:05:39,902
I thought you might
be interested.

1369
01:05:39,972 --> 01:05:41,633
Someone's just
offered us a painting

1370
01:05:41,707 --> 01:05:45,268
we feel very doubtful about.

1371
01:05:45,344 --> 01:05:48,040
No a woman.

1372
01:05:48,113 --> 01:05:49,341
We're awfully
busy at the moment,

1373
01:05:49,414 --> 01:05:52,315
but if you wanted
to stop by sometime.

1374
01:05:56,188 --> 01:05:57,485
There.

1375
01:05:57,556 --> 01:05:58,648
Everything you need?

1376
01:05:58,724 --> 01:05:59,520
All right.

1377
01:05:59,591 --> 01:06:01,582
Thank you.

1378
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:04,322
There is just one thing.

1379
01:06:04,396 --> 01:06:07,297
Could you explain to
me exactly what you do

1380
01:06:07,366 --> 01:06:09,561
when you perform
a post mortem.

1381
01:06:09,635 --> 01:06:11,694
I'm sure Dr. Simpkins would
be delighted to show you.

1382
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:12,759
Do come through.

1383
01:06:12,838 --> 01:06:14,362
No no, sorry
I didn't mean that.

1384
01:06:14,439 --> 01:06:17,840
I meant how do you actually
make out the report?

1385
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:19,400
It's perfectly simple.

1386
01:06:19,478 --> 01:06:21,309
The doctor does
the examination.

1387
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:23,041
I make a detailed record.

1388
01:06:23,115 --> 01:06:24,309
I do a dental report.

1389
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:25,372
Take fingerprints.

1390
01:06:25,450 --> 01:06:27,315
Report on vital organs,
cause of death.

1391
01:06:27,386 --> 01:06:30,822
Ah, you take fingerprints.

1392
01:06:30,889 --> 01:06:34,086
I wonder, would you
mind taking mine?

1393
01:06:34,159 --> 01:06:35,421
What?

1394
01:06:35,494 --> 01:06:38,395
No, you see I'm trying to
understand the process.

1395
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:40,488
Trying to see if
anything could go wrong.

1396
01:06:40,566 --> 01:06:42,591
Nothing could go wrong.

1397
01:06:42,668 --> 01:06:44,192
Well?

1398
01:06:45,437 --> 01:06:47,371
Very well.

1399
01:06:47,439 --> 01:06:48,497
Thank you.

1400
01:06:55,414 --> 01:06:57,473
You have very warm hands.

1401
01:06:58,951 --> 01:07:00,919
Do you live alone?

1402
01:07:00,986 --> 01:07:03,454
No.

1403
01:07:03,522 --> 01:07:05,285
Only child?

1404
01:07:05,357 --> 01:07:06,517
I have a brother.

1405
01:07:06,592 --> 01:07:08,116
Brother.

1406
01:07:08,193 --> 01:07:09,922
I always wanted a brother.

1407
01:07:09,995 --> 01:07:11,656
Except my dad took
one look at me

1408
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:14,028
and thought my mother
had suffered enough.

1409
01:07:14,099 --> 01:07:15,293
Yes.

1410
01:07:15,367 --> 01:07:16,459
Nearly finished.

1411
01:07:16,535 --> 01:07:18,867
All right.

1412
01:07:18,937 --> 01:07:19,995
I see, thank you.

1413
01:07:20,072 --> 01:07:23,838
Now then, so what you do
is you fill out this report,

1414
01:07:23,909 --> 01:07:25,137
put it in a file like that,

1415
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:26,040
Thank you.

1416
01:07:26,111 --> 01:07:27,339
And you send it over to us.

1417
01:07:27,412 --> 01:07:28,379
Is that how it works?

1418
01:07:28,447 --> 01:07:29,778
Yes, one here, one to you.

1419
01:07:29,848 --> 01:07:31,213
I'm not sure I understand you.

1420
01:07:31,283 --> 01:07:33,342
You're saying you lost
the file we sent you?

1421
01:07:33,418 --> 01:07:34,885
Isn't it kept
in police records?

1422
01:07:34,953 --> 01:07:36,648
Well, if it
arrived at my office

1423
01:07:36,722 --> 01:07:38,485
it could have
ended up anywhere.

1424
01:07:38,557 --> 01:07:40,548
Well, then I don't think
you should take ours.

1425
01:07:40,626 --> 01:07:42,526
Oh, all right.

1426
01:07:42,594 --> 01:07:44,528
Well, just make a
copy of that will you

1427
01:07:44,596 --> 01:07:46,291
and send it over to my office.

1428
01:07:46,365 --> 01:07:48,333
Really, Mr. Frost.

1429
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,163
Thank you.

1430
01:07:50,235 --> 01:07:52,965
What do I do with these?

1431
01:07:53,038 --> 01:07:54,801
Oh, I'd put them on file.

1432
01:07:54,873 --> 01:07:56,067
You never know,
save you a job,

1433
01:07:56,141 --> 01:07:58,803
in case I end up
on one of your slabs.

1434
01:08:03,248 --> 01:08:04,579
Jack!

1435
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:06,174
Been looking for
you everywhere.

1436
01:08:06,251 --> 01:08:09,015
I want a talk about
the Black Farm Murder.

1437
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:10,554
Come on Sandy,

1438
01:08:10,622 --> 01:08:13,284
you're talking
about eight years ago.

1439
01:08:13,358 --> 01:08:14,347
I'm talking now.

1440
01:08:14,426 --> 01:08:15,290
I warn you, Jack,

1441
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:16,588
you've got a real
scandal on your hands.

1442
01:08:16,662 --> 01:08:19,028
Our feisty local MP's

1443
01:08:19,097 --> 01:08:22,089
off to see the
Home Secretary.

1444
01:08:22,167 --> 01:08:22,997
Sandy.

1445
01:08:23,068 --> 01:08:26,162
Ferdie Giggs is a small time
crook with a big time mouth

1446
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:29,230
who can say anything
because he's living in Spain.

1447
01:08:29,308 --> 01:08:31,742
Ferdie would admit to the
Slaughter of the Innocents

1448
01:08:31,810 --> 01:08:33,675
if it meant he could
get a big fat check

1449
01:08:33,745 --> 01:08:34,939
out of one of you lot.

1450
01:08:35,013 --> 01:08:36,947
He says Mrs. Dale hired him

1451
01:08:37,015 --> 01:08:41,247
to kill her husband
for the insurance.

1452
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:44,517
The Black Farm murder was
an art theft that went wrong.

1453
01:08:44,589 --> 01:08:46,716
Ferdie Giggs wasn't
even there the night

1454
01:08:46,792 --> 01:08:49,124
that Jonathan Dale
was murdered.

1455
01:08:49,194 --> 01:08:50,786
He was there for the
funeral though, wasn't he?

1456
01:08:50,862 --> 01:08:54,923
Newspaper files, Jack.

1457
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,401
That's Ferdie Giggs, isn't it?

1458
01:08:58,470 --> 01:08:59,664
And that's Mrs Dale?

1459
01:08:59,738 --> 01:09:02,104
Yes, yes, yes, all right.

1460
01:09:02,174 --> 01:09:05,769
You kept this
file on the case?

1461
01:09:05,844 --> 01:09:06,640
Course.

1462
01:09:06,712 --> 01:09:09,476
That's how
newspapers function.

1463
01:09:09,548 --> 01:09:12,176
You couldn't let me have a
copy of that file could you.

1464
01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:15,378
Over at my office,
as soon as possible?

1465
01:09:15,454 --> 01:09:19,151
Paper co-operates
with re-investigation?

1466
01:09:19,224 --> 01:09:22,455
Or have you just
lost your records?

1467
01:09:26,264 --> 01:09:28,061
My office as soon as possible.

1468
01:09:28,133 --> 01:09:29,657
Thank you, Sandy.

1469
01:09:32,571 --> 01:09:34,732
Possibly in her early forties.

1470
01:09:34,806 --> 01:09:38,105
Quite intelligent
and educated.

1471
01:09:38,176 --> 01:09:40,872
Sunglasses, wearing
a big overcoat.

1472
01:09:40,946 --> 01:09:42,243
And what was the painting?

1473
01:09:42,314 --> 01:09:43,645
I recognized it at once.

1474
01:09:43,715 --> 01:09:44,807
It was a Hockney.

1475
01:09:44,883 --> 01:09:47,215
One of the California
swimming pool series.

1476
01:09:47,285 --> 01:09:50,118
No doubt you asked
about its provenance.

1477
01:09:50,188 --> 01:09:51,780
Yes.

1478
01:09:51,857 --> 01:09:53,552
That was when she said
she didn't want to sell it

1479
01:09:53,625 --> 01:09:55,422
and walked out.

1480
01:09:55,494 --> 01:09:56,483
Hockney?

1481
01:09:56,561 --> 01:09:59,428
Wouldn't that
be really valuable?

1482
01:09:59,498 --> 01:10:03,457
Yes, of course,
a small fortune.

1483
01:10:08,473 --> 01:10:09,599
Mrs. Dale?

1484
01:10:10,709 --> 01:10:11,698
Detective Inspector Frost,

1485
01:10:11,777 --> 01:10:13,938
Denton CID.

1486
01:10:14,012 --> 01:10:16,173
We met about eight years ago.

1487
01:10:16,248 --> 01:10:17,510
Yes, I remember.

1488
01:10:17,582 --> 01:10:19,880
When Jonathan was murdered.

1489
01:10:19,951 --> 01:10:20,975
I have been expecting you.

1490
01:10:21,052 --> 01:10:24,488
Ever since I read that
story about Ferdie Giggs.

1491
01:10:24,556 --> 01:10:27,184
Yeah, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

1492
01:10:27,259 --> 01:10:29,989
I'm sorry, but I do
have to ask you this.

1493
01:10:30,061 --> 01:10:32,689
Ferdie Giggs maintains
that you asked him

1494
01:10:32,764 --> 01:10:34,891
to do the killings so
that you could collect

1495
01:10:34,966 --> 01:10:37,025
the insurance money
on the paintings.

1496
01:10:37,102 --> 01:10:40,003
There wasn't any insurance
on the paintings.

1497
01:10:40,071 --> 01:10:42,801
Jonathan never bothered.

1498
01:10:42,874 --> 01:10:44,000
Take a look.

1499
01:10:46,311 --> 01:10:50,213
It's not worth a
killing for, is it?

1500
01:10:50,282 --> 01:10:51,306
No.

1501
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,915
Ferdie was a dealer.

1502
01:10:57,989 --> 01:11:02,551
He sold Jonathan
a few paintings.

1503
01:11:02,627 --> 01:11:04,219
And so Ferdie
tipped off his friends

1504
01:11:04,296 --> 01:11:07,424
that there was something
worth taking at the house.

1505
01:11:07,499 --> 01:11:10,957
but he wasn't
there that night?

1506
01:11:11,036 --> 01:11:12,298
No.

1507
01:11:12,370 --> 01:11:14,099
We'd been away
for the weekend.

1508
01:11:14,172 --> 01:11:15,605
The weather turned bad

1509
01:11:15,674 --> 01:11:18,302
an Jonathan was
worried about his beasts.

1510
01:11:18,376 --> 01:11:20,503
We came home on
the Saturday night

1511
01:11:20,579 --> 01:11:22,604
and there in the house...

1512
01:11:22,681 --> 01:11:24,911
Were two men, right?

1513
01:11:24,983 --> 01:11:26,780
One was Branson.

1514
01:11:26,852 --> 01:11:28,114
Who was the other?

1515
01:11:28,186 --> 01:11:29,483
Well, we never
found out, did we?

1516
01:11:29,554 --> 01:11:33,752
No, because he was wearing
a balaclava over his face.

1517
01:11:33,825 --> 01:11:35,725
But it couldn't have
been Ferdie Giggs,

1518
01:11:35,794 --> 01:11:36,818
he was too tall.

1519
01:11:36,895 --> 01:11:40,194
Exactly.

1520
01:11:40,265 --> 01:11:43,701
So what about your
husband's paintings?

1521
01:11:43,768 --> 01:11:46,669
One of them was
quite valuable, was it?

1522
01:11:46,738 --> 01:11:49,002
You mean the David Hockney.

1523
01:11:49,074 --> 01:11:50,336
Yes.

1524
01:11:50,408 --> 01:11:52,205
Yes, his brother
gave it to him.

1525
01:11:52,277 --> 01:11:54,973
He said he'd been given
it by Hockney himself.

1526
01:11:55,046 --> 01:11:57,310
Jonathan never
insured that either.

1527
01:11:57,382 --> 01:12:03,252
It went in the robbery,
and that was that.

1528
01:12:03,321 --> 01:12:05,346
Did you know it was
offered for sale yesterday.

1529
01:12:05,423 --> 01:12:07,391
At the Ansty Gallery.

1530
01:12:07,459 --> 01:12:08,983
You've found it then?

1531
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:10,027
No.

1532
01:12:10,095 --> 01:12:13,064
It was offered for
sale by a woman.

1533
01:12:13,131 --> 01:12:15,759
Oh, and you thought it was me.

1534
01:12:15,834 --> 01:12:17,631
It wasn't.

1535
01:12:17,702 --> 01:12:19,533
No, well I did wonder,

1536
01:12:19,604 --> 01:12:24,701
but I don't
believe it was you.

1537
01:12:24,776 --> 01:12:29,611
Did you know a man called
Leslie Jackson, an Australian?

1538
01:12:29,681 --> 01:12:30,739
No, I didn't.

1539
01:12:30,815 --> 01:12:33,579
Should I have done?

1540
01:12:33,652 --> 01:12:36,746
No, it was just a thought.

1541
01:12:36,821 --> 01:12:40,655
Well, thank you
very much Mrs. Dale.

1542
01:12:40,725 --> 01:12:44,456
Does this mean I might
get the paintings back?

1543
01:12:44,529 --> 01:12:46,554
I don't know.

1544
01:12:46,631 --> 01:12:47,689
I'm sorry.

1545
01:12:47,766 --> 01:12:49,700
I honestly don't know.

1546
01:13:20,365 --> 01:13:21,457
Something for me?

1547
01:13:21,533 --> 01:13:22,056
Yeah.

1548
01:13:22,133 --> 01:13:23,896
Miss Grey brought this
over from the path lab,

1549
01:13:23,969 --> 01:13:25,766
said you've to be more
careful with it this time.

1550
01:13:25,837 --> 01:13:26,667
Oh, thank you.

1551
01:13:26,738 --> 01:13:28,467
Oh, and this stuff
just came over

1552
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:30,838
from the Denton Evening Echo,

1553
01:13:30,909 --> 01:13:31,603
and Jack?

1554
01:13:31,676 --> 01:13:32,404
Yes?

1555
01:13:32,477 --> 01:13:33,341
Mullett wants to see you.

1556
01:13:33,411 --> 01:13:34,469
And he won't take
no for an answer.

1557
01:13:34,546 --> 01:13:36,741
Good, cos I can't
wait to see him.

1558
01:13:36,815 --> 01:13:38,680
I will.

1559
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:40,115
I will.

1560
01:13:40,185 --> 01:13:41,447
Yes, I will dear.

1561
01:13:42,887 --> 01:13:43,876
Yes, dear.

1562
01:13:48,793 --> 01:13:49,725
Well?

1563
01:13:51,096 --> 01:13:52,757
I thought you wanted
to see me, sir.

1564
01:13:52,831 --> 01:13:54,230
You know I do, yes.

1565
01:14:02,841 --> 01:14:03,830
Now I'm being interviewed

1566
01:14:03,908 --> 01:14:06,468
for the post of Assistant
Chief Constable on Wednesday.

1567
01:14:06,544 --> 01:14:09,672
And very good
luck to you, sir.

1568
01:14:09,748 --> 01:14:11,375
No doubt some
people in this station

1569
01:14:11,449 --> 01:14:12,973
would be pleased to
see the back of me.

1570
01:14:13,051 --> 01:14:14,245
Oh, no.

1571
01:14:14,319 --> 01:14:17,720
In which case I'd appreciate
a good deal more co-operation.

1572
01:14:17,789 --> 01:14:19,086
Everything in
this station's fine

1573
01:14:19,157 --> 01:14:20,749
except for three
outstanding problems

1574
01:14:20,825 --> 01:14:22,315
every one to do with you.

1575
01:14:22,394 --> 01:14:24,157
You're not referring
to my petrol expenses,

1576
01:14:24,229 --> 01:14:26,026
are you, sir?

1577
01:14:28,066 --> 01:14:29,090
Thank you very much,

1578
01:14:29,167 --> 01:14:31,067
but that's not
what I meant, no.

1579
01:14:31,136 --> 01:14:34,037
What about the
Black Farm Murder?

1580
01:14:34,105 --> 01:14:36,039
Yes, here's the file.

1581
01:14:36,107 --> 01:14:38,098
Sorry it took so long.

1582
01:14:49,921 --> 01:14:53,220
They're just
newspaper cuttings.

1583
01:14:53,291 --> 01:14:54,485
Yes.

1584
01:14:54,559 --> 01:14:57,084
But we've nearly
settled the case.

1585
01:14:57,162 --> 01:15:00,461
Ferdie Giggs was lying.

1586
01:15:00,532 --> 01:15:03,524
He was only after a
Fleet Street handout.

1587
01:15:03,601 --> 01:15:06,263
He never was at the
scene of the crime.

1588
01:15:06,337 --> 01:15:08,703
We've also managed to trace

1589
01:15:08,773 --> 01:15:11,173
a number of the
Black Farm paintings.

1590
01:15:11,242 --> 01:15:15,338
Trouble is, they were in the
hands of Lester Bryce-Jones.

1591
01:15:15,413 --> 01:15:17,574
The victim at the
Riverside Apartments.

1592
01:15:17,649 --> 01:15:21,585
But, he does seem to be
linked with the Appendix Man,

1593
01:15:21,653 --> 01:15:25,453
so, one investigation
leads to another.

1594
01:15:25,523 --> 01:15:28,048
We should have this
all cleared up in,

1595
01:15:28,126 --> 01:15:30,560
well you know,
no time at all.

1596
01:15:30,628 --> 01:15:32,926
By Wednesday?

1597
01:15:32,997 --> 01:15:35,090
Wednesday?

1598
01:15:35,166 --> 01:15:37,134
Yes, probably Wednesday, yes.

1599
01:15:37,202 --> 01:15:40,535
Well, that's excellent.

1600
01:15:40,605 --> 01:15:41,435
Good.

1601
01:15:41,506 --> 01:15:42,598
Thank you, sir.

1602
01:15:44,776 --> 01:15:47,336
Oh, there is one small thing

1603
01:15:47,412 --> 01:15:49,073
that you could help me with.

1604
01:15:49,147 --> 01:15:51,741
I need an exhumation order.

1605
01:15:51,816 --> 01:15:53,215
Who for?

1606
01:15:53,284 --> 01:15:54,717
Well, I don't know his name.

1607
01:15:54,786 --> 01:15:55,980
He's the Appendix Man.

1608
01:15:56,054 --> 01:15:56,918
If you don't know his name,

1609
01:15:56,988 --> 01:15:58,353
how do you know you
need an exhumation?

1610
01:15:58,423 --> 01:16:00,050
Well, I will
know his name

1611
01:16:00,125 --> 01:16:02,059
when I've taken
his fingerprints.

1612
01:16:02,127 --> 01:16:03,788
I thought he'd
been dead a year.

1613
01:16:03,862 --> 01:16:05,625
Yes he has, but he's been
in the freezer in the morgue

1614
01:16:05,697 --> 01:16:06,925
until a couple of weeks ago,

1615
01:16:06,998 --> 01:16:09,091
so that should
present no problem.

1616
01:16:09,167 --> 01:16:09,997
You do realize

1617
01:16:10,068 --> 01:16:13,765
you're putting me under
the most absurd pressure?

1618
01:16:13,838 --> 01:16:15,499
Yes, I know sir.

1619
01:16:15,573 --> 01:16:18,371
If you could do
it before Wednesday.

1620
01:16:18,443 --> 01:16:22,209
It means that we could
close all three cases at once.

1621
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:25,841
You know, just before
your interview.

1622
01:16:30,922 --> 01:16:32,549
You know, this job

1623
01:16:32,624 --> 01:16:37,652
would mean a great deal
to Elsbeth, my wife.

1624
01:16:37,729 --> 01:16:40,857
It means a great
deal to everyone, sir.

1625
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,059
I just hope you get
a result, that's all.

1626
01:16:53,136 --> 01:16:54,535
I really had to
twist Coroner's arm.

1627
01:16:54,604 --> 01:16:57,698
Yes, I'm very grateful, sir.

1628
01:16:57,774 --> 01:17:00,004
Did you pass on
those petrol receipts?

1629
01:17:00,076 --> 01:17:01,475
Yes, I did.

1630
01:17:01,544 --> 01:17:02,511
Why?

1631
01:17:02,578 --> 01:17:04,239
No reason.

1632
01:17:04,313 --> 01:17:07,544
I just wondered if County
was pleased, that's all.

1633
01:17:33,710 --> 01:17:35,041
Will this take long?

1634
01:17:35,111 --> 01:17:36,772
No.

1635
01:17:36,846 --> 01:17:38,473
Not long, sir.

1636
01:17:56,165 --> 01:17:58,690
Yes, all right, Ernie,
come on get on with it.

1637
01:17:58,768 --> 01:18:00,326
Oh, right.

1638
01:18:00,403 --> 01:18:03,270
Now listen carefully.

1639
01:18:03,339 --> 01:18:06,570
This is the fingerprint
of the Appendix Man

1640
01:18:06,642 --> 01:18:09,634
taken from our records.

1641
01:18:09,712 --> 01:18:12,840
And this is the fingerprint

1642
01:18:12,915 --> 01:18:14,542
taken from the glass

1643
01:18:14,617 --> 01:18:16,983
from Riverside Apartments.

1644
01:18:17,053 --> 01:18:18,680
They are the same.

1645
01:18:18,755 --> 01:18:21,815
And this is the fingerprint

1646
01:18:21,891 --> 01:18:27,124
taken off the Appendix Man's
dead body this morning.

1647
01:18:27,196 --> 01:18:29,027
Different.

1648
01:18:30,433 --> 01:18:33,061
So whose are
these others then?

1649
01:18:33,136 --> 01:18:36,003
Well it's not so much as who,

1650
01:18:36,072 --> 01:18:38,267
as to why and how.

1651
01:18:38,341 --> 01:18:41,902
How did a stray set of
prints get into our system?

1652
01:18:41,978 --> 01:18:44,674
Someone wanted
to disappear?

1653
01:18:44,747 --> 01:18:47,614
Maybe someone
wanted him to disappear.

1654
01:18:47,683 --> 01:18:49,310
Someone didn't want us

1655
01:18:49,385 --> 01:18:51,683
to find out who he was.

1656
01:18:51,754 --> 01:18:54,086
Maybe he's got form.

1657
01:18:54,157 --> 01:18:55,454
Could you check him out?

1658
01:18:55,525 --> 01:18:57,652
Yeah, yeah, sure
give me an hour or so.

1659
01:18:57,727 --> 01:18:59,456
It still won't tell
us who did the switch.

1660
01:18:59,529 --> 01:19:01,997
Could someone
hack into our system?

1661
01:19:02,064 --> 01:19:04,157
Only someone on the inside.

1662
01:19:04,233 --> 01:19:06,224
It's not a very
nice thought, is it?

1663
01:19:06,302 --> 01:19:09,032
No, it isn't.

1664
01:19:09,105 --> 01:19:10,902
By the way.

1665
01:19:10,973 --> 01:19:14,033
Could you get a set of
prints off that file for me?

1666
01:19:14,110 --> 01:19:15,475
Yeah.

1667
01:19:21,384 --> 01:19:23,113
What is the matter with you?

1668
01:19:23,186 --> 01:19:23,982
Oh, I don't know.

1669
01:19:24,053 --> 01:19:26,112
My stomach's giving
me gip this morning.

1670
01:19:26,189 --> 01:19:28,783
Must have been
something I ate.

1671
01:19:33,362 --> 01:19:34,727
Really?

1672
01:19:37,934 --> 01:19:38,958
All right?

1673
01:19:39,035 --> 01:19:43,131
Did the dead man speak then?

1674
01:19:43,206 --> 01:19:44,605
Yes he did.

1675
01:19:44,674 --> 01:19:47,006
He said tell that
idle sod Jordan

1676
01:19:47,076 --> 01:19:48,703
to get down to
the art gallery

1677
01:19:48,778 --> 01:19:50,405
and find out who
really did offer

1678
01:19:50,479 --> 01:19:54,040
that Hockney for sale.

1679
01:19:54,116 --> 01:19:55,242
Yes, guv.

1680
01:19:55,318 --> 01:19:57,718
Thank you.

1681
01:19:57,787 --> 01:20:01,814
Guv, we've a proper ident
on Lester Bryce Jones,

1682
01:20:01,891 --> 01:20:04,189
alias Leslie Jackson.

1683
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:05,557
What?

1684
01:20:05,628 --> 01:20:08,392
He was Leonard Jefford
from Adelaide, Aus..

1685
01:20:08,464 --> 01:20:10,455
How many more names
is he going to have?

1686
01:20:10,533 --> 01:20:12,364
South Australian
police had him on file.

1687
01:20:12,435 --> 01:20:14,403
Oh, well, he'd got form then?

1688
01:20:14,470 --> 01:20:15,596
Minor stuff.

1689
01:20:15,671 --> 01:20:17,434
He was part of the gay scene.

1690
01:20:17,506 --> 01:20:20,634
He was known around as a
bit of an actor and painter.

1691
01:20:20,710 --> 01:20:22,940
Worked as a
waiter and a deckhand,

1692
01:20:23,012 --> 01:20:25,537
and then in 1993,

1693
01:20:25,615 --> 01:20:26,877
he decided to
come to the Big Smoke

1694
01:20:26,949 --> 01:20:28,541
and seek his
fame and fortune.

1695
01:20:28,618 --> 01:20:29,778
And the poor sod ended up

1696
01:20:29,852 --> 01:20:31,752
as a porter in
Denton General.

1697
01:20:31,821 --> 01:20:33,288
Don't knock it, George.

1698
01:20:33,356 --> 01:20:34,653
He had twenty five
grand in the bank

1699
01:20:34,724 --> 01:20:36,589
and a Hockney in the cupboard.

1700
01:20:36,659 --> 01:20:42,757
Problem is, how did he get
it there from Black Farm?

1701
01:20:42,832 --> 01:20:45,596
Well, come on keep thinking.

1702
01:20:52,775 --> 01:20:53,742
Thank you.

1703
01:21:02,285 --> 01:21:03,980
All right, there you go.

1704
01:21:04,053 --> 01:21:06,749
Get those Black Farm
files I sent you?

1705
01:21:06,822 --> 01:21:07,880
Yes thank you, Sandy.

1706
01:21:07,957 --> 01:21:09,948
Hornrimmed Harry
was very grateful.

1707
01:21:10,026 --> 01:21:10,822
Cheers.

1708
01:21:10,893 --> 01:21:11,985
What about you?

1709
01:21:12,061 --> 01:21:15,258
Change your mind
about Ferdie Giggs?

1710
01:21:15,331 --> 01:21:19,062
I will never change my
mind about Ferdie Giggs.

1711
01:21:19,135 --> 01:21:20,363
He tells porkies.

1712
01:21:20,436 --> 01:21:23,269
He always did
and he always will.

1713
01:21:23,339 --> 01:21:24,465
He said he did it

1714
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:27,509
so that Mrs. Dale could
claim the insurance money.

1715
01:21:27,576 --> 01:21:29,703
Only problem is, the
pictures were never insured.

1716
01:21:29,779 --> 01:21:31,076
Mrs. Dale got nothing.

1717
01:21:31,147 --> 01:21:31,909
Are you sure?

1718
01:21:31,981 --> 01:21:33,915
Course I am.

1719
01:21:33,983 --> 01:21:37,885
So who did kill Jonathan Dale?

1720
01:21:37,954 --> 01:21:39,945
Branson.

1721
01:21:40,022 --> 01:21:42,286
The man I put away.

1722
01:21:42,358 --> 01:21:43,655
There were two men, Jack.

1723
01:21:43,726 --> 01:21:45,057
You never found the other.

1724
01:21:45,127 --> 01:21:46,719
The one that got the pictures.

1725
01:21:46,796 --> 01:21:49,560
Well it wasn't Ferdie.

1726
01:21:49,632 --> 01:21:51,862
We've got the pictures back,
well most of them anyway.

1727
01:21:51,934 --> 01:21:54,061
Oh, great.

1728
01:21:54,136 --> 01:21:56,229
Who then, if it wasn't Ferdie?

1729
01:21:56,305 --> 01:22:00,332
If you're very good, Sandy,

1730
01:22:00,409 --> 01:22:03,776
you'll be the first to know.

1731
01:22:06,215 --> 01:22:07,045
Good afternoon.

1732
01:22:07,116 --> 01:22:08,174
Ah, Jack!

1733
01:22:08,250 --> 01:22:09,410
Yes, that's me.

1734
01:22:09,485 --> 01:22:10,474
The Appendix Man.

1735
01:22:10,553 --> 01:22:11,815
Oh, yeah, what about him?

1736
01:22:11,887 --> 01:22:13,218
No ident on file.

1737
01:22:13,289 --> 01:22:15,519
But I got another
match for you though.

1738
01:22:15,591 --> 01:22:17,889
You'll never guess where from.

1739
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:19,860
Black Farm murder.

1740
01:22:19,929 --> 01:22:21,396
How could you know that?

1741
01:22:21,464 --> 01:22:25,093
Because I asked myself
a question, Ernie.

1742
01:22:25,167 --> 01:22:28,330
How could a painting that
went missing eight years ago

1743
01:22:28,404 --> 01:22:32,067
end up in the apartment
of a hospital porter.

1744
01:22:32,141 --> 01:22:34,473
The only answer
I could come up with

1745
01:22:34,543 --> 01:22:37,876
was the Appendix Man.

1746
01:22:37,947 --> 01:22:39,005
Just a minute.

1747
01:22:39,081 --> 01:22:41,140
You know those other
prints, the stray ones.

1748
01:22:41,217 --> 01:22:43,014
I got a match on them too.

1749
01:22:43,085 --> 01:22:45,246
Off the cover of
that pathology file.

1750
01:22:45,321 --> 01:22:47,789
The one marked Dead Male One.

1751
01:22:59,702 --> 01:23:00,862
Aah.

1752
01:23:02,104 --> 01:23:03,765
Inspector Frost!

1753
01:23:03,839 --> 01:23:06,399
Sorry if I startled
you, Miss Grey.

1754
01:23:06,475 --> 01:23:07,942
Just thought I'd drop by

1755
01:23:08,010 --> 01:23:10,843
and thank you for
letting me have that file.

1756
01:23:10,913 --> 01:23:12,881
Well, don't
lose it this time.

1757
01:23:12,948 --> 01:23:13,972
No I won't.

1758
01:23:14,050 --> 01:23:16,985
Unfortunately I seem to
have made another mistake.

1759
01:23:17,053 --> 01:23:18,179
Really?

1760
01:23:18,254 --> 01:23:19,551
Yes.

1761
01:23:19,622 --> 01:23:20,782
You see one of our rules is

1762
01:23:20,856 --> 01:23:23,518
that anyone who is at
the scene of a crime

1763
01:23:23,592 --> 01:23:25,651
must have their
fingerprints on file.

1764
01:23:25,728 --> 01:23:27,923
It's for elimination
purposes, you understand,

1765
01:23:27,997 --> 01:23:32,331
but unfortunately we
don't seem to have yours.

1766
01:23:32,401 --> 01:23:33,698
Mine?

1767
01:23:33,769 --> 01:23:34,895
Yes.

1768
01:23:34,970 --> 01:23:36,369
So I was wondering
if you wouldn't mind

1769
01:23:36,439 --> 01:23:38,464
just popping down
to the station.

1770
01:23:38,541 --> 01:23:40,702
You know, you've seen mine,

1771
01:23:40,776 --> 01:23:43,006
I'd like to see yours.

1772
01:23:43,079 --> 01:23:45,411
Is that really necessary?

1773
01:23:45,481 --> 01:23:47,574
Well, yes, I'm afraid it is.

1774
01:23:47,650 --> 01:23:50,881
You see we've found a set
of unidentified fingerprints

1775
01:23:50,953 --> 01:23:53,285
on a drinking glass

1776
01:23:53,355 --> 01:23:55,084
at Riverside Apartments.

1777
01:23:55,157 --> 01:23:59,992
And I was just wondering
if they could be yours.

1778
01:24:00,062 --> 01:24:03,054
Oh, yes,

1779
01:24:03,132 --> 01:24:05,100
I did pick up a glass.

1780
01:24:05,167 --> 01:24:09,228
Ah, well, that would be
it then, wouldn't it?

1781
01:24:09,305 --> 01:24:12,741
But unfortunately those
prints are exactly the same

1782
01:24:12,808 --> 01:24:17,142
as the Appendix Man's.

1783
01:24:17,213 --> 01:24:18,510
I don't see how
that's possible.

1784
01:24:18,581 --> 01:24:20,742
A mix-up in your lab?

1785
01:24:20,816 --> 01:24:22,613
If there was a mix up,
I apologize, of course.

1786
01:24:22,685 --> 01:24:24,118
But isn't it more likely

1787
01:24:24,186 --> 01:24:26,848
the mix-up was in your office?

1788
01:24:26,922 --> 01:24:27,911
Oh, yes.

1789
01:24:27,990 --> 01:24:29,958
It's very possible.

1790
01:24:31,660 --> 01:24:33,651
But you did know him
didn't you Miss Gray?

1791
01:24:33,729 --> 01:24:34,559
Who did I know?

1792
01:24:34,630 --> 01:24:35,654
The Appendix Man.

1793
01:24:35,731 --> 01:24:36,663
What was his name?

1794
01:24:36,732 --> 01:24:39,530
Ian Pri...

1795
01:24:39,602 --> 01:24:41,194
Ian Priest.

1796
01:24:41,270 --> 01:24:45,036
Ian Priest.

1797
01:24:45,107 --> 01:24:46,870
Thank you.

1798
01:24:54,550 --> 01:24:56,916
I know you felt
sorry for him once.

1799
01:24:56,986 --> 01:24:58,715
You shouldn't have.

1800
01:24:58,787 --> 01:24:59,981
He wasn't a nice man.

1801
01:25:00,055 --> 01:25:01,420
He was a thief
and a blackmailer.

1802
01:25:01,490 --> 01:25:03,424
I'm surprised that you
knew him then, Miss Grey.

1803
01:25:03,492 --> 01:25:05,687
He knew my brother.

1804
01:25:05,761 --> 01:25:08,229
David's a solicitor.

1805
01:25:08,297 --> 01:25:11,027
And a homosexual.

1806
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:13,762
As was Ian Priest.

1807
01:25:13,836 --> 01:25:17,499
He made a habit of
stealing from his boyfriends.

1808
01:25:17,573 --> 01:25:19,598
Not just small things,

1809
01:25:19,675 --> 01:25:22,337
paintings, antiques.

1810
01:25:22,411 --> 01:25:23,343
If they complained,

1811
01:25:23,412 --> 01:25:24,674
he threatened
them with blackmail.

1812
01:25:24,747 --> 01:25:28,581
In the end he'd taken
everything from David.

1813
01:25:28,651 --> 01:25:30,551
And then Priest,

1814
01:25:30,619 --> 01:25:36,455
the Appendix
Man ended up here?

1815
01:25:36,525 --> 01:25:40,518
I substituted my
fingerprints for his.

1816
01:25:40,596 --> 01:25:42,723
I knew if you
identified Ian Priest,

1817
01:25:42,798 --> 01:25:44,561
the whole story
would come out

1818
01:25:44,633 --> 01:25:45,622
and David would be ruined.

1819
01:25:45,701 --> 01:25:48,465
I didn't know what to do.

1820
01:25:48,537 --> 01:25:51,005
I didn't think
it would matter.

1821
01:25:51,073 --> 01:25:55,009
He was dead anyway.

1822
01:25:55,077 --> 01:25:57,443
I wasn't hurting anyone.

1823
01:26:03,953 --> 01:26:07,514
And then you left
your fingerprints

1824
01:26:07,590 --> 01:26:13,222
at Riverside Apartments.

1825
01:26:13,295 --> 01:26:15,058
I must ask you this,

1826
01:26:15,130 --> 01:26:17,064
were you
involved in any way

1827
01:26:17,132 --> 01:26:19,828
in Ian Priest's death?

1828
01:26:19,902 --> 01:26:21,961
Of course not.

1829
01:26:22,037 --> 01:26:23,834
His death was
accidental drowning.

1830
01:26:23,906 --> 01:26:25,396
Yeah, well, I'm not
so sure about that.

1831
01:26:25,474 --> 01:26:26,168
Well, I don't know.

1832
01:26:26,242 --> 01:26:28,472
But I had no part in it.

1833
01:26:31,914 --> 01:26:34,610
And Lester Bryce-Jones,

1834
01:26:34,683 --> 01:26:36,310
did you recognize him?

1835
01:26:36,385 --> 01:26:38,216
No, I didn't.

1836
01:26:41,223 --> 01:26:43,054
Thank you, Miss Grey.

1837
01:26:47,363 --> 01:26:48,990
What's going to happen now?

1838
01:26:52,401 --> 01:26:56,337
Are you going to charge me?

1839
01:26:56,405 --> 01:26:57,838
Oh yes.

1840
01:26:59,808 --> 01:27:01,673
Go on get your coat.

1841
01:27:11,687 --> 01:27:12,449
Well, well.

1842
01:27:12,521 --> 01:27:14,148
Bit of a mess, isn't it?

1843
01:27:14,223 --> 01:27:16,214
Yes it's all the stuff
from his hideaway

1844
01:27:16,292 --> 01:27:17,554
in Infirmary Road.

1845
01:27:17,626 --> 01:27:19,389
There's his passport,

1846
01:27:19,461 --> 01:27:21,554
He arrived in 1993.

1847
01:27:21,630 --> 01:27:22,722
He wasn't even in the country

1848
01:27:22,798 --> 01:27:24,129
at the time of the
Black Farm Murder.

1849
01:27:24,199 --> 01:27:25,894
You surprise me.

1850
01:27:25,968 --> 01:27:29,062
And a photograph.

1851
01:27:29,138 --> 01:27:31,368
Isn't that the Appendix Man?

1852
01:27:33,909 --> 01:27:35,706
Yes.

1853
01:27:35,778 --> 01:27:38,508
Yes it is.

1854
01:27:38,580 --> 01:27:43,176
And did you know his
name was Ian Priest.

1855
01:27:43,252 --> 01:27:48,815
So, so he knew Leslie Jackson

1856
01:27:48,891 --> 01:27:53,453
before he went into hospital.

1857
01:27:53,529 --> 01:27:54,996
Of course.

1858
01:27:55,064 --> 01:27:56,759
It all fits.

1859
01:27:56,832 --> 01:27:58,823
What does?

1860
01:27:58,901 --> 01:28:01,461
Ian Priest knows
that he's very ill

1861
01:28:01,537 --> 01:28:03,129
and he's got to
go into hospital.

1862
01:28:03,205 --> 01:28:04,297
And he's worried in case

1863
01:28:04,373 --> 01:28:06,739
the authorities
find out who he is

1864
01:28:06,809 --> 01:28:10,370
and links him with
the Black Farm murder.

1865
01:28:10,446 --> 01:28:12,038
So, what does he do?

1866
01:28:12,114 --> 01:28:14,048
Empties his
pockets and goes in

1867
01:28:14,116 --> 01:28:17,779
with a stolen
drivers' licence.

1868
01:28:17,853 --> 01:28:21,289
So there he is,

1869
01:28:21,357 --> 01:28:22,949
Iying on the hospital bed,

1870
01:28:23,025 --> 01:28:24,014
with a burst appendix

1871
01:28:24,093 --> 01:28:26,994
when who comes
rattling down the ward

1872
01:28:27,062 --> 01:28:31,192
with his bedpans
but Leslie Jackson.

1873
01:28:31,266 --> 01:28:32,198
He killed him?

1874
01:28:32,267 --> 01:28:33,962
No, no, no.

1875
01:28:34,036 --> 01:28:38,302
No, no, I reckon
he tries to help him.

1876
01:28:38,374 --> 01:28:41,104
Says he'll get him
out of the hospital.

1877
01:28:41,176 --> 01:28:43,872
Find him a private doctor.

1878
01:28:48,183 --> 01:28:49,616
But of course,

1879
01:28:49,685 --> 01:28:51,050
once Priest
leaves the hospital,

1880
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:52,644
he's finished.

1881
01:28:52,721 --> 01:28:54,689
He's too far gone.

1882
01:28:57,626 --> 01:29:00,754
Leslie Jackson
finds out about that,

1883
01:29:00,829 --> 01:29:04,993
and there's only one
way to keep it quiet.

1884
01:29:16,011 --> 01:29:17,205
Come on, man!

1885
01:29:17,279 --> 01:29:20,942
Don't die on me now!

1886
01:29:21,016 --> 01:29:23,211
Jesus!

1887
01:29:48,277 --> 01:29:51,405
But you don't know that?

1888
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:56,179
I know that
I don't know that.

1889
01:29:56,251 --> 01:29:58,219
I can guess it though.

1890
01:29:58,287 --> 01:30:01,256
And then a year later someone
kills Lester Bryce-Jones

1891
01:30:01,323 --> 01:30:03,086
and one thing
leads to another?

1892
01:30:03,158 --> 01:30:05,922
Yes, I hope so.

1893
01:30:07,729 --> 01:30:09,424
Who then?

1894
01:30:09,498 --> 01:30:11,591
That's what we've
got to find out.

1895
01:30:29,618 --> 01:30:30,846
Debbie?

1896
01:30:32,254 --> 01:30:34,085
I'll just be a moment.

1897
01:30:40,629 --> 01:30:42,563
I'm sorry, I can't...

1898
01:30:43,465 --> 01:30:44,489
Not you again?

1899
01:30:44,566 --> 01:30:47,558
Mmm, I was just having a
look at my astral chart.

1900
01:30:47,636 --> 01:30:50,104
Trouble is I can't remember
what my star sign is.

1901
01:30:50,172 --> 01:30:51,366
Look, I've got a client.

1902
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:53,305
That's all right, go
ahead, don't mind me.

1903
01:30:53,375 --> 01:30:56,208
I only came in
looking for a painting.

1904
01:30:57,379 --> 01:30:59,244
Pamela, would you?

1905
01:31:03,752 --> 01:31:05,276
What painting?

1906
01:31:05,354 --> 01:31:09,984
A painting of a swimming
pool by David Hockney.

1907
01:31:10,058 --> 01:31:13,221
And what makes you
think it's here?

1908
01:31:13,295 --> 01:31:15,695
Because you tried to
sell it two days ago,

1909
01:31:15,764 --> 01:31:18,324
at the Ansty Galleries.

1910
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:21,028
The attendant identified you.

1911
01:31:21,103 --> 01:31:22,832
Do you want to know how?

1912
01:31:22,905 --> 01:31:25,135
By your tattoo.

1913
01:31:28,076 --> 01:31:29,600
Well Mrs. Viner.

1914
01:31:29,678 --> 01:31:32,044
Do you want me to
get a search warrant?

1915
01:31:32,114 --> 01:31:34,776
Or will you just
show me where it is?

1916
01:31:54,937 --> 01:31:57,269
That painting we found in
your shop, Mrs. Viner,

1917
01:31:57,339 --> 01:31:58,499
it was stolen.

1918
01:31:58,574 --> 01:32:00,303
In a robbery
about eight years ago.

1919
01:32:00,375 --> 01:32:01,467
That's nothing to do with me.

1920
01:32:01,543 --> 01:32:03,408
I didn't know.

1921
01:32:03,478 --> 01:32:04,968
That's a pity.

1922
01:32:05,047 --> 01:32:07,845
You should always
ask about provenance.

1923
01:32:07,916 --> 01:32:10,612
Did you know that Leslie
dealt in stolen paintings.

1924
01:32:10,686 --> 01:32:12,654
No.

1925
01:32:12,721 --> 01:32:15,781
Look, that day he came
home with the Hockney.

1926
01:32:15,857 --> 01:32:18,724
He wanted someone
to help him sell it.

1927
01:32:18,794 --> 01:32:20,056
Oh, really?

1928
01:32:20,128 --> 01:32:21,254
And what time was this?

1929
01:32:21,330 --> 01:32:22,297
It was in the morning.

1930
01:32:22,364 --> 01:32:23,422
I saw him in the hall.

1931
01:32:23,498 --> 01:32:25,056
He asked you to help
him sell the painting?

1932
01:32:25,133 --> 01:32:26,566
What sort of help?

1933
01:32:26,635 --> 01:32:28,569
Oh, did I know any galleries?

1934
01:32:28,637 --> 01:32:31,333
Collectors who might
come to my studio?

1935
01:32:31,406 --> 01:32:33,237
And he gave it
to you, did he?

1936
01:32:33,308 --> 01:32:35,071
He just gave it you,
just like that?

1937
01:32:35,143 --> 01:32:36,405
Yes, he did.

1938
01:32:36,478 --> 01:32:38,878
No, he didn't!

1939
01:32:38,947 --> 01:32:40,471
Because your
daughter Leonie said

1940
01:32:40,549 --> 01:32:43,279
that she saw the
painting in his apartment

1941
01:32:43,352 --> 01:32:46,480
at 4:30 when she
came home from school.

1942
01:32:46,555 --> 01:32:48,489
You left and came back
again, didn't you?

1943
01:32:48,557 --> 01:32:49,581
Why would I?

1944
01:32:49,658 --> 01:32:52,092
Because you realized
Leslie had something
worth a small fortune

1945
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:54,219
and you wanted
your share.

1946
01:32:54,296 --> 01:32:55,456
Only what you
didn't know was

1947
01:32:55,530 --> 01:32:56,690
that he couldn't get
rid of that painting

1948
01:32:56,765 --> 01:32:59,598
because it
was hot stuff.

1949
01:32:59,668 --> 01:33:03,502
It came from a murder scene.

1950
01:33:03,572 --> 01:33:05,597
I didn't go back.

1951
01:33:05,674 --> 01:33:07,335
You had a key to the door.

1952
01:33:07,409 --> 01:33:10,105
You had the opportunity,
the motive and the will.

1953
01:33:10,178 --> 01:33:12,271
Do you know what I think?

1954
01:33:12,347 --> 01:33:14,975
I think that you and
Lester Bryce-Jones

1955
01:33:15,050 --> 01:33:17,746
were running a
nice little racket.

1956
01:33:17,819 --> 01:33:21,983
Clients at your studio
could buy paintings

1957
01:33:22,057 --> 01:33:23,854
with no questions asked.

1958
01:33:23,925 --> 01:33:25,790
And then you and
Leslie or Lester

1959
01:33:25,861 --> 01:33:27,988
or whatever his
ruddy name was

1960
01:33:28,063 --> 01:33:29,928
could split the proceeds.

1961
01:33:29,998 --> 01:33:31,625
Sorry, no way.

1962
01:33:31,700 --> 01:33:34,191
Oh yes.

1963
01:33:34,269 --> 01:33:38,228
But this time he wasn't
playing ball, was he?

1964
01:33:38,306 --> 01:33:41,036
So I think that you went
to have it out with him.

1965
01:33:41,109 --> 01:33:43,270
When you knocked at the
door and go no answer,

1966
01:33:43,345 --> 01:33:47,179
you used your key
to let yourself in.

1967
01:33:47,249 --> 01:33:49,410
And when you went in

1968
01:33:49,484 --> 01:33:53,477
you found Leslie up
to some deviant trick,

1969
01:33:53,555 --> 01:33:55,614
probably high
on painkillers

1970
01:33:55,691 --> 01:33:58,319
but certainly not in
a position to argue.

1971
01:33:58,393 --> 01:34:01,829
I don't believe this.

1972
01:34:01,897 --> 01:34:04,957
And then you tightened
the belt around his neck,

1973
01:34:05,033 --> 01:34:07,593
just to make sure.

1974
01:34:07,669 --> 01:34:09,762
Then you opened
the doors to the patio

1975
01:34:09,838 --> 01:34:12,068
so it looked as though
someone came in that way.

1976
01:34:12,140 --> 01:34:14,438
You returned the
key to your apartment

1977
01:34:14,509 --> 01:34:18,240
then you took the
painting to your studio.

1978
01:34:18,313 --> 01:34:21,043
Mrs. Viner, I believe
that you are responsible

1979
01:34:21,116 --> 01:34:23,380
for the murder
of Leslie Jackson,

1980
01:34:23,452 --> 01:34:25,818
alias Lester Bryce-Jones.

1981
01:34:25,887 --> 01:34:26,911
No, it wasn't like that.

1982
01:34:26,988 --> 01:34:28,114
He was unconscious.

1983
01:34:28,190 --> 01:34:28,918
(Knock on door)

1984
01:34:28,990 --> 01:34:29,957
Yes?

1985
01:34:32,761 --> 01:34:33,955
DC Jordan has
entered the room

1986
01:34:34,029 --> 01:34:36,156
with a note for DI Frost.

1987
01:34:53,982 --> 01:34:55,142
So he was dying

1988
01:34:55,217 --> 01:34:58,015
and you offered
him no assistance?

1989
01:35:02,491 --> 01:35:05,016
I took the painting.

1990
01:35:05,093 --> 01:35:06,287
I was strapped for money.

1991
01:35:06,361 --> 01:35:07,589
The studio earns nothing.

1992
01:35:07,662 --> 01:35:09,596
There are
Leonie's school fees.

1993
01:35:12,701 --> 01:35:13,929
I'd helped him before.

1994
01:35:14,002 --> 01:35:15,697
Not that I liked him.

1995
01:35:15,771 --> 01:35:17,295
Fact is he made
my skin crawl,

1996
01:35:17,372 --> 01:35:19,567
but the money was useful.

1997
01:35:19,641 --> 01:35:21,108
Except this time he
was cutting me out.

1998
01:35:21,176 --> 01:35:22,370
And as soon as
I saw that picture

1999
01:35:22,444 --> 01:35:25,106
I knew what it was.

2000
01:35:25,180 --> 01:35:27,114
But it wasn't.

2001
01:35:27,182 --> 01:35:28,877
What do you mean?

2002
01:35:28,950 --> 01:35:33,478
It was a forgery.

2003
01:35:33,555 --> 01:35:36,547
The painting wasn't genuine.

2004
01:36:01,216 --> 01:36:04,049
Morning Mullett.

2005
01:36:04,119 --> 01:36:05,552
Morning, sir.

2006
01:36:05,620 --> 01:36:07,417
A word in your ear.

2007
01:36:26,474 --> 01:36:28,135
I'm really sorry, sir.

2008
01:36:30,345 --> 01:36:32,870
Yes.

2009
01:36:32,948 --> 01:36:35,314
I think everyone
will be really sorry.

2010
01:36:39,221 --> 01:36:40,654
Yes.

2011
01:36:42,257 --> 01:36:46,626
Especially Mrs. Mullett.

2012
01:36:46,695 --> 01:36:50,756
Especially Mrs. Mullett.

2013
01:36:50,832 --> 01:36:53,801
Did they give you a reason?

2014
01:36:53,869 --> 01:36:57,635
Yes, they gave me a reason.

2015
01:36:57,706 --> 01:36:58,604
There was another candidate

2016
01:36:58,673 --> 01:37:01,369
that some of the
board preferred.

2017
01:37:01,443 --> 01:37:05,345
A woman Super
from Northumberland,

2018
01:37:05,413 --> 01:37:07,381
very strong on management.

2019
01:37:07,449 --> 01:37:11,909
Oh, well, you can't
blame yourself then.

2020
01:37:11,987 --> 01:37:15,184
No, I can't.

2021
01:37:15,257 --> 01:37:17,282
I can blame...

2022
01:37:22,264 --> 01:37:23,731
Who?

2023
01:37:23,798 --> 01:37:25,197
I don't know how you
could do it to me, Jack.

2024
01:37:25,267 --> 01:37:27,758
You can't blame me, I did
everything that you asked.

2025
01:37:27,836 --> 01:37:29,235
I cleared up my three cases.

2026
01:37:29,304 --> 01:37:30,566
I did my expenses.

2027
01:37:30,639 --> 01:37:33,073
Yes, that was what did it.

2028
01:37:33,141 --> 01:37:35,268
What?

2029
01:37:35,343 --> 01:37:37,174
It seems I foolishly failed

2030
01:37:37,245 --> 01:37:39,975
to check your paperwork.

2031
01:37:40,048 --> 01:37:42,744
You signed those petrol
receipts yourself didn't you?

2032
01:37:42,817 --> 01:37:45,945
Forged the signatures.

2033
01:37:46,021 --> 01:37:52,153
As someone on the board
was very quick to point out.

2034
01:37:52,227 --> 01:37:53,717
Yeah, well, I mean,
I didn't think that...

2035
01:37:53,795 --> 01:37:56,286
No, you didn't, did you?

2036
01:38:14,049 --> 01:38:16,210
My resignation.

2037
01:38:28,063 --> 01:38:32,466
Just get out of
my office, Jack.

2038
01:38:32,534 --> 01:38:34,627
Go on, get out!

2039
01:39:04,899 --> 01:39:06,560
Brian, are you there?

2040
01:39:14,676 --> 01:39:16,268
Mr. Frost.

2041
01:39:16,344 --> 01:39:17,572
Ah.

2042
01:39:18,646 --> 01:39:19,908
On your way?

2043
01:39:19,981 --> 01:39:21,209
Yes, yes, I am.

2044
01:39:21,282 --> 01:39:24,080
I'm moving into
my new house.

2045
01:39:24,152 --> 01:39:28,248
Well, it's my
old house actually.

2046
01:39:28,323 --> 01:39:29,449
Got to start learning

2047
01:39:29,524 --> 01:39:32,220
how to be a domestic
animal once again.

2048
01:39:32,293 --> 01:39:33,851
You should get
yourself a cat.

2049
01:39:33,928 --> 01:39:35,828
Well, me, no.

2050
01:39:35,897 --> 01:39:37,159
Can't stand them.

2051
01:39:40,101 --> 01:39:43,867
Anyway, we shall
miss you, Mr. Frost.

2052
01:39:43,938 --> 01:39:46,736
Well, I'll miss
you too, Brian.

2053
01:39:46,808 --> 01:39:49,470
You've been a great support.

2054
01:39:49,544 --> 01:39:50,943
And Donald.

2055
01:39:51,012 --> 01:39:51,774
Is he here?

2056
01:39:51,846 --> 01:39:52,870
I never did get to...

2057
01:39:52,947 --> 01:39:56,110
I'll tell you a
little secret, Mr. Frost.

2058
01:39:56,184 --> 01:39:58,118
There is no Donald.

2059
01:39:58,186 --> 01:40:00,177
It's all just me.

2060
01:40:00,255 --> 01:40:02,849
Donald left three months ago.

2061
01:40:12,267 --> 01:40:15,134
Goodbye, Brian.

2062
01:40:15,203 --> 01:40:17,137
Jack.
