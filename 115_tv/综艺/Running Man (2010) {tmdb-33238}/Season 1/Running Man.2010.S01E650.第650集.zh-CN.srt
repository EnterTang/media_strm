1
00:01:27,957 --> 00:01:32,832
There is one kidnapping every 60 minutes
in Latin America.

2
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,000
70°%° ofthe victims do not survive.

3
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:28,928
?Si? ?Bueno?

4
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:32,799
Family is everything, no?

5
00:02:32,895 --> 00:02:36,180
Now, do you love your son?

6
00:02:37,649 --> 00:02:39,191
Si.

7
00:02:47,743 --> 00:02:51,360
Now, do you understand?

8
00:02:52,455 --> 00:02:56,867
You have a $10 million insurance policy.
I know that.

9
00:02:57,418 --> 00:02:58,876
Follow these instructions

10
00:02:59,128 --> 00:03:01,619
or God be with your child.

11
00:03:02,131 --> 00:03:03,506
You will remove your shirt

12
00:03:03,591 --> 00:03:05,713
and hold it out the window to ID the car.

13
00:03:06,677 --> 00:03:08,669
Be professional.

14
00:03:09,763 --> 00:03:10,676
Come alone.

15
00:03:20,315 --> 00:03:23,066
!Porfavor!!Ayùdenme!

16
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:33,696
!Ayùdenme, porfavor!

17
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:07,352
EL PASO, TEXAS
US / MEXICO BORDER

18
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:11,879
Georgina! Obey me.
I will love you. Come on.

19
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,163
- That's how it works, huh?
- That's right.

20
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,555
She got a sister?

21
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,555
How's business?

22
00:05:29,815 --> 00:05:32,768
The Japanese are here in a big way.

23
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:40,782
Cheap labour, factory space, but they feel
a lot safer living over the border in EI Paso.

24
00:05:40,868 --> 00:05:45,944
I ferry them back and forth.
They think I'm John Wayne.

25
00:05:50,376 --> 00:05:53,661
- I live like a king down here.
- Yes, you do.

26
00:05:57,216 --> 00:06:00,501
- You been workin'?
- Yeah. No.

27
00:06:00,595 --> 00:06:05,256
No. I've been movin' around. You know.
Colombia, a couple of places I can't name.

28
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:08,634
Nothin' catches my fancy.

29
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:15,271
You think God'll forgive us
for what we've done?

30
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:17,565
- No.
- You don't?

31
00:06:17,653 --> 00:06:18,981
Me either.

32
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,198
- How long you stayin'?
- I don't know, I just... you know.

33
00:06:26,287 --> 00:06:30,284
I wanted to see you, Ray,
see how you're doin'.

34
00:06:30,374 --> 00:06:32,947
I just came by on impulse.

35
00:06:33,043 --> 00:06:35,579
I could do with some impulse.

36
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,548
What happened?

37
00:06:49,725 --> 00:06:56,142
Family paid the ransom, then they
sent the kid home after a couple of days.

38
00:06:56,232 --> 00:06:58,390
Minus an ear, of course.

39
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:02,184
Now every mother in Mexico City
with money wants bigger bodyguards.

40
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,573
- My own wife included.
- I hate to break it to you, but she's right.

41
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:09,066
She's right.

42
00:07:09,161 --> 00:07:13,573
Look, Sammy, all my clients
have kidnap and ransom insurance.

43
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,916
I have a policy.
AIG. My dad gave it to me.

44
00:07:17,002 --> 00:07:19,871
Yeah, I know. I got it for your dad.

45
00:07:19,963 --> 00:07:24,624
But what'll you do in 60 days when you can't
renew it because you have no bodyguard?

46
00:07:24,717 --> 00:07:27,587
I know. I had to let Emilio go.

47
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:32,803
Well, you gotta please Lisa.
I mean, ass like that's hard to find.

48
00:07:33,851 --> 00:07:35,927
Look.

49
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:41,358
A bodyguard's like anything else.
You get what you pay for, OK?

50
00:07:41,442 --> 00:07:44,395
You could do this.
Get one that's got a decent résumé.

51
00:07:44,487 --> 00:07:48,615
We're not lookin' for goddamn Superman,
right? Get someone cheap.

52
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:55,318
So you renew the policy, and then
fire the prick for whatever - incompetence.

53
00:07:55,414 --> 00:08:00,075
All kidding aside, the most important thing
is that your daughter goes back to school,

54
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:03,121
and that your wife gets to save face.

55
00:08:03,213 --> 00:08:09,714
This way you won't be the only
unprotected family in the neighbourhood.

56
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:24,142
That's right, a bodyguard.
Your Spanish is good enough.

57
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:27,317
- You're crazy.
- You even look the part.

58
00:08:27,403 --> 00:08:29,395
In my state, I couldn't guard a corpse.

59
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:33,486
It's rich guys flashing their cash.
It's all for show. Nothing's gonna happen.

60
00:08:33,576 --> 00:08:38,072
Yeah? You think they'd
hire a drunk, a has-been?

61
00:08:39,457 --> 00:08:41,698
You have to keep it under control.

62
00:08:43,085 --> 00:08:47,911
What ifthere was, you know... just, say,
a kidnapping attempt? What do I do then?

63
00:08:48,006 --> 00:08:52,881
You do your best. They're not gonna be
paying you enough to perform miracles.

64
00:08:52,969 --> 00:08:57,381
It's not exactly a scam, Crease.
Even at half speed, you're pretty damn good.

65
00:08:57,474 --> 00:09:01,222
Yeah. A bodyguard's gotta
be close to people, though.

66
00:09:01,311 --> 00:09:04,347
They talk all the time.
You know I'm no good at that.

67
00:09:04,439 --> 00:09:08,483
You'll be the silent type.
They're gonna appreciate that.

68
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:18,322
Bodyguard. So who's the guy?

69
00:09:18,411 --> 00:09:21,198
Samuel Ramos. He's a young guy.

70
00:09:21,289 --> 00:09:25,582
- He owns one ofthe plants in Juàrez.
- Yeah?

71
00:09:25,668 --> 00:09:28,123
The Jap car industry is in the toilet.

72
00:09:28,212 --> 00:09:31,627
He's trying to persuade Ford
to partner with him.

73
00:09:31,716 --> 00:09:35,546
I think he's in trouble.
His family lives in Mexico City.

74
00:09:35,635 --> 00:09:39,584
He asked me if I knew anybody he could trust.

75
00:09:39,681 --> 00:09:42,681
- And you thought of me?
- Yeah.

76
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:46,301
Take ajob, Crease. Breathe some air.

77
00:09:46,396 --> 00:09:48,637
Then decide ifyou want to stick around.

78
00:09:48,732 --> 00:09:53,025
Besides, I'm glad to see you, you know?
I got nobody to talk to down here.

79
00:10:00,618 --> 00:10:05,612
Listen, my wife wants
someone presentable and polite.

80
00:10:05,707 --> 00:10:09,241
You'll be the fifth candidate
she sees this week.

81
00:10:09,335 --> 00:10:11,078
Your résumé's quite impressive.

82
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:15,713
16 years of military experience,
extensive counter-terrorism work.

83
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,214
I'm surprised anybody could afford you.
What's the catch?

84
00:10:19,302 --> 00:10:21,508
I drink.

85
00:10:21,596 --> 00:10:23,672
How does that affect you?

86
00:10:26,268 --> 00:10:28,390
Coordination, reaction time.

87
00:10:28,478 --> 00:10:32,012
Iftop professionals try to kidnap
your daughter, I'll do the best I can,

88
00:10:32,107 --> 00:10:34,598
but the service will be on a par with the pay.

89
00:10:36,611 --> 00:10:38,603
What if amateurs try it?

90
00:10:38,697 --> 00:10:42,030
I'd probably kill 'em. Is that likely?

91
00:10:42,117 --> 00:10:43,990
No.

92
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:49,319
No one is to know about your drinking.
That includes my wife.

93
00:11:14,648 --> 00:11:16,724
Lisa!

94
00:11:18,735 --> 00:11:20,811
Lisa!

95
00:11:32,749 --> 00:11:35,915
My wife Lisa.
And this is John Creasy.

96
00:11:41,883 --> 00:11:44,171
- You're an American.
- So are you.

97
00:11:45,553 --> 00:11:47,010
It's all in there.

98
00:11:51,975 --> 00:11:55,806
- Would you like a drink?
- Yes. Jack and water would be good.

99
00:11:57,147 --> 00:11:59,602
Have you done much of
this kind ofwork before?

100
00:11:59,691 --> 00:12:00,853
No, ma'am.

101
00:12:00,942 --> 00:12:04,773
But he has a lot of experience
in related fields.

102
00:12:07,157 --> 00:12:09,992
- Do you have a family, Mr Creasy?
- No.

103
00:12:10,535 --> 00:12:13,026
Pita? Pita.

104
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,786
- Yes, Mom?
- Honey, this is Mr Creasy.

105
00:12:21,963 --> 00:12:24,833
Buenas tardes, señor Creasy.
Mucho gusto en conocerle.

106
00:12:24,924 --> 00:12:29,918
It's English, honey. Do you wanna
show Mr Creasy to his room?

107
00:12:30,013 --> 00:12:32,467
- This way, Mr Creasy.
- OK.

108
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,396
Thank you.

109
00:12:51,283 --> 00:12:52,658
Just like that?

110
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:59,160
I think it's nice that he's an American.

111
00:12:59,249 --> 00:13:03,495
I think it's terrific. Are you sure?

112
00:13:06,131 --> 00:13:08,004
Thank you.

113
00:13:08,341 --> 00:13:09,965
Thank you.

114
00:13:11,011 --> 00:13:13,087
I feel better now.

115
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:18,343
- !Hola, Bruno!
- Buenas tardes.

116
00:13:18,434 --> 00:13:23,095
That's Bruno, the gardener.
And that's Maria, the cook.

117
00:13:23,188 --> 00:13:26,058
- !Hola, Maria!
- Hola, Pita.

118
00:13:28,277 --> 00:13:32,357
We fixed the room up two weeks ago.
It's nicer than before.

119
00:13:35,409 --> 00:13:39,358
You've got a TV and a CD player.
What kind of music do you like, Mr Creasy?

120
00:13:39,454 --> 00:13:43,119
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

121
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:46,078
I don't know.

122
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:50,747
That's Bird. Emilio forgot
to take him when he left.

123
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,172
Emilio was my last bodyguard.

124
00:13:56,137 --> 00:14:00,382
Have you protected
a lot of children before, Mr Creasy?

125
00:14:00,474 --> 00:14:04,222
Creasy. You can call me Creasy.
And no, you're the first.

126
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:06,137
Creasy.

127
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,518
Bye, Creasy.

128
00:14:11,068 --> 00:14:12,941
Bye, Bird.

129
00:14:22,663 --> 00:14:27,704
- School tomorrow, Peeps.
- Does that mean we can get a dog?

130
00:14:27,793 --> 00:14:30,248
Dad promised me one
when I went back to school.

131
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:32,495
Yeah, we'll see.

132
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:37,583
Ifyou get a dog, will you give up your bear?
You're getting too old for him.

133
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:46,182
- How did you like Mr Creasy?
- Creasy. He said to call him just Creasy.

134
00:14:46,268 --> 00:14:50,312
- That isn't disrespectful, is it?
- No, not if he asked you.

135
00:14:50,397 --> 00:14:53,314
Here. There you go.

136
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,239
He's like a bear, too.

137
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:06,325
- Yeah?
- A big, sad bear.

138
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:12,621
- Is he sad?
- I think. Or something.

139
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,166
Good night, honey.

140
00:15:21,261 --> 00:15:23,882
Can you get me some floss in the morning?

141
00:15:23,972 --> 00:15:25,929
- Floss?
- Yeah, the strawberry kind.

142
00:15:26,016 --> 00:15:27,842
Sure.

143
00:15:30,895 --> 00:15:32,971
Good night, Bear.

144
00:15:34,023 --> 00:15:36,099
Creasy Bear.

145
00:16:09,433 --> 00:16:13,928
- What's that one for?
- La Virgen de Guadalupe.

146
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,851
Business. For Toyota, for Ford.

147
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:23,444
If one dies, maybe she can
resurrect the other one. I don't know.

148
00:16:25,739 --> 00:16:27,815
She likes him.

149
00:16:28,784 --> 00:16:31,820
- What are you talkin' about?
- Creasy.

150
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,406
Pita likes him.

151
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:43,286
Pita loves school. Pita would love Count
Dracula if he took her back there, honey.

152
00:16:43,382 --> 00:16:45,255
OK?

153
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:49,840
Hey. Are you OK?

154
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:52,385
- I don't know.
- OK?

155
00:16:54,726 --> 00:16:58,390
I don't know, Lisa. I'm trying.

156
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,573
Come on, Bird.

157
00:17:56,661 --> 00:17:59,614
That's right, that's right. Come on.

158
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:01,448
All right.

159
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,449
Home to Emilio.

160
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:06,410
You're home free, baby.

161
00:18:26,482 --> 00:18:29,268
- Where are you from, Creasy?
- The US.

162
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,311
- I know, but which state?
- No state in particular.

163
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:40,066
- You can drive and talk at the same time.
- No, I can't, Pita, so please let me do myjob.

164
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:41,868
Are you going to stay?

165
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:48,116
My last bodyguard left. Somebody
gave him more money than we could.

166
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,159
I guess that makes me a bargain, then, huh?

167
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:57,416
Being black. Is that a positive or a negative
for a bodyguard in Mexico?

168
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,717
Time will tell.

169
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:06,394
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City
in the last six days.

170
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,051
- Four a day.
- Yeah? 24?

171
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,930
- 24. What do you think about that?
- I think you know more than you should.

172
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,852
Well, thank you.

173
00:19:43,097 --> 00:19:45,932
- See you later.
- You have to sign.

174
00:19:46,017 --> 00:19:49,385
- What?
- You have to sign in. Show them your ID.

175
00:19:49,478 --> 00:19:51,554
- Buenos dias.
- Buenos dias.

176
00:19:51,647 --> 00:19:52,975
Come on.

177
00:19:54,233 --> 00:19:55,976
Right there.

178
00:19:56,068 --> 00:19:58,771
- Hola, Manuel.
- Hola, Pita.

179
00:20:08,788 --> 00:20:11,457
- !Hola, Pita!
- !Hola!

180
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:15,331
Pita! It's so good to have you back.

181
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,753
Sister Anna,
this is my new bodyguard, Creasy.

182
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,920
- Sister Anna, the headmistress.
- Señor Creasy.

183
00:20:24,178 --> 00:20:28,555
- Hurry. Class is about to begin. Go, go.
- Bye, Creasy.

184
00:20:28,641 --> 00:20:29,755
Madre.

185
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:33,432
You must look after our Pita.
It is not good that she is late today.

186
00:20:33,521 --> 00:20:37,981
I'm very sorry. I have to get used to
the routes. It won't happen again.

187
00:20:38,067 --> 00:20:41,814
No offence, but I regret that
your profession needs to exist.

188
00:20:41,903 --> 00:20:44,987
So do l, Madre, so do l.

189
00:20:45,073 --> 00:20:48,821
Do you ever see the hand of God
in what you do?

190
00:20:50,495 --> 00:20:52,571
No, not for a long time.

191
00:20:52,664 --> 00:20:55,534
The Bible says, "Be not overcome of evil..."

192
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:59,836
"But overcome evil with good."

193
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:02,791
That's Romans Chapter 12 Verse 21.

194
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,796
I am the sheep that got lost, Madre.

195
00:22:12,157 --> 00:22:16,534
When you were a kid, Creasy,
did you like school?

196
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,992
- I don't remember.
- You don't remember?

197
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,994
No, I don't remember.
No, I didn't like it.

198
00:22:23,084 --> 00:22:25,372
Why not?

199
00:22:25,462 --> 00:22:29,958
Because it wasn't a school like yours, Pita.
There was no Sister Anna.

200
00:22:32,635 --> 00:22:35,007
Were you unhappy?

201
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,591
Being unhappy, that's a state of mind.
I really don't remember.

202
00:22:49,986 --> 00:22:52,358
What happened to your hand?

203
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:55,529
- It's a birth defect.
- No, it's not.

204
00:22:55,615 --> 00:22:57,109
Look, no more questions, OK?

205
00:22:59,995 --> 00:23:03,862
- It really wasn't a question.
- It sounded like a question to me.

206
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:07,407
No, gracias. Gracias, no, no.

207
00:23:07,502 --> 00:23:09,874
Listen to me.
I'm being paid to protect you.

208
00:23:09,963 --> 00:23:10,994
No, no, no.

209
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:14,623
I'm being paid to be your bodyguard.
Look at me.

210
00:23:15,176 --> 00:23:21,510
I'm not being paid to be your friend, but
to protect you. So no more questions, period.

211
00:23:23,476 --> 00:23:25,053
- Do you hear me?
- Yes.

212
00:23:27,856 --> 00:23:30,477
- No crying.
- I'm not crying.

213
00:23:31,526 --> 00:23:33,648
Well, don't start.

214
00:23:33,736 --> 00:23:37,235
You gotta understand, this is ajob.
In order for me to do myjob...

215
00:23:39,908 --> 00:23:42,196
Wait a minute.

216
00:24:30,499 --> 00:24:32,575
Yeah, come in.

217
00:24:38,173 --> 00:24:40,249
Mr Creasy.

218
00:24:40,967 --> 00:24:43,920
I just wanted to make sure
you have everything you need.

219
00:24:44,012 --> 00:24:45,470
I'm fine, thanks.

220
00:24:47,098 --> 00:24:51,594
Is the food all right?
Because Maria told me you didn't eat.

221
00:24:53,188 --> 00:24:57,933
Yeah, the food is great.
I just wasn't that hungry tonight.

222
00:25:00,403 --> 00:25:03,072
So you read the Bible?

223
00:25:03,907 --> 00:25:06,658
Yeah, sometimes.

224
00:25:06,743 --> 00:25:08,865
Does it help?

225
00:25:08,952 --> 00:25:10,659
Yeah, sometimes.

226
00:25:12,915 --> 00:25:16,118
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.

227
00:25:18,128 --> 00:25:21,081
How are you doing with Pita?

228
00:25:21,173 --> 00:25:22,750
Fine.

229
00:25:22,841 --> 00:25:26,375
As soon as she figures out that
I'm not her new toy, it'll be fine.

230
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,961
- She told me about that.
- OK.

231
00:25:30,515 --> 00:25:33,883
- You don't have children, do you?
- I told you I didn't.

232
00:25:33,977 --> 00:25:36,930
Well, they can be tenacious
when they want something.

233
00:25:37,022 --> 00:25:39,643
And Pitajust wants to be friends.

234
00:25:39,733 --> 00:25:41,392
OK.

235
00:25:41,484 --> 00:25:46,988
But you're paying me to protect her,
not to be her friend, right?

236
00:25:48,491 --> 00:25:50,567
So...

237
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:54,360
Look, maybe this isn't gonna work out.

238
00:25:54,455 --> 00:25:59,662
Maybe your husband should find
somebody that's a little more sociable.

239
00:26:02,045 --> 00:26:03,420
No, you're right.

240
00:26:05,966 --> 00:26:08,717
You're being paid to protect her.

241
00:26:08,802 --> 00:26:12,336
And I'm confident that you'll do that.

242
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:21,804
I'll be coming with you tomorrow.
I hope that's all right.

243
00:26:50,884 --> 00:26:54,134
You think God'll forgive us
for what we've done?

244
00:27:19,788 --> 00:27:23,736
I'm tired of killin', Ray.
I'm tired of killin', Ray.

245
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:31,170
You think God'll forgive us
for what we've done?

246
00:27:31,256 --> 00:27:33,462
In my state, I couldn't...

247
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,672
I couldn't guard a corpse.

248
00:27:35,761 --> 00:27:37,753
They talk all the time.

249
00:27:37,846 --> 00:27:40,681
You know I'm no good at that.

250
00:27:41,058 --> 00:27:43,893
You know I'm no good at that.

251
00:27:45,103 --> 00:27:46,929
You know how they say...

252
00:27:48,732 --> 00:27:51,732
a bullet always tells the truth?

253
00:28:32,941 --> 00:28:34,732
Yeah?

254
00:28:34,818 --> 00:28:37,059
- Hey.
- Crease.

255
00:28:37,154 --> 00:28:38,813
What's wrong?

256
00:28:38,906 --> 00:28:44,991
Hey, listen, you ever have
a 9mm round that didn't go off?

257
00:28:45,078 --> 00:28:47,699
Yeah. Failure to fire.

258
00:28:47,789 --> 00:28:50,955
I know, failure to fire and...

259
00:28:51,043 --> 00:28:56,083
You know, I pulled the trigger
and click - nothing.

260
00:28:56,172 --> 00:29:00,632
- You're talkin' about a bad primer.
- Yeah, yeah, but l...

261
00:29:00,718 --> 00:29:05,463
Yeah, right. Dimple on the primer.
That may be...

262
00:29:05,556 --> 00:29:07,928
Well, like we used to say...

263
00:29:09,268 --> 00:29:12,055
a bullet always tells the truth.

264
00:29:19,153 --> 00:29:22,023
Crease? You all right?

265
00:29:22,114 --> 00:29:23,857
Yeah.

266
00:29:24,908 --> 00:29:27,315
What were you shootin' at?

267
00:29:27,411 --> 00:29:29,699
Yeah, I'm sorry, Ray. I'm sorry I woke you.

268
00:29:29,788 --> 00:29:33,832
No, it's OK, it's nothin'. I was watchin' TV.

269
00:29:35,711 --> 00:29:37,786
OK.

270
00:30:57,414 --> 00:31:00,035
Pita, you have a pencil?

271
00:31:04,505 --> 00:31:06,163
Thank you.

272
00:31:39,872 --> 00:31:44,783
- It's hard to get used to the traffic down here.
- Yeah. I'm very sorry.

273
00:32:05,438 --> 00:32:07,560
- See you, baby.
- See you later.

274
00:32:07,648 --> 00:32:11,977
- Hey, don't forget your towel.
- Thank you.

275
00:32:17,491 --> 00:32:19,364
Bye.

276
00:33:25,014 --> 00:33:27,967
- You're a strong swimmer.
- I never win.

277
00:33:33,898 --> 00:33:35,771
Thanks.

278
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:41,774
So, what do I do?

279
00:33:41,864 --> 00:33:45,363
You're the fastest in the water,
the slowest offthe blocks.

280
00:33:45,451 --> 00:33:47,823
What do you think that means?
What you gotta do?

281
00:33:47,912 --> 00:33:51,031
- Get faster offthe blocks?
- Get faster offthe blocks.

282
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:54,448
- Our big swim meet is in three weeks.
- Yeah?

283
00:33:54,544 --> 00:34:00,297
- I was gonna enter the 150 freestyle.
- You'll be fine. You'll be OK.

284
00:34:02,009 --> 00:34:04,380
- I'll still be slow.
- You're not slow.

285
00:34:04,469 --> 00:34:09,676
- I never finish better than third.
- Then maybe you are slow.

286
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:15,637
With us this evening we have
Mariana Guerrero from Reforma newspaper

287
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:18,102
to speak with us about the kidnappings.

288
00:34:19,234 --> 00:34:22,484
Who are the ones responsible
for the kidnappings in Mexico?

289
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:26,318
It is an activity of organised crime.
It's not a random kidnapping.

290
00:34:26,407 --> 00:34:28,613
They are not political kidnappings
like in Colombia.

291
00:34:28,701 --> 00:34:30,942
!Vamos, Bird!

292
00:34:31,037 --> 00:34:33,113
!Vamos!

293
00:34:38,836 --> 00:34:41,540
How do you think he got out?

294
00:34:43,174 --> 00:34:44,549
I let him go.

295
00:34:44,634 --> 00:34:48,299
- It's better to be free, right?
- It's better for him.

296
00:34:50,013 --> 00:34:52,966
Actually, he was driving me crazy.

297
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:58,470
Good night.

298
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:05,436
Good night.

299
00:35:20,668 --> 00:35:23,585
- See you in a couple of days, OK? I love you.
- Love you.

300
00:35:23,671 --> 00:35:25,544
Be good. Come on, Lise.

301
00:35:25,631 --> 00:35:29,130
All right, sweetheart,
so we'll call you from Detroit, OK?

302
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:32,127
- I love you.
- Love you.

303
00:35:32,221 --> 00:35:34,342
- OK, bye.
- Señora, su café.

304
00:35:34,431 --> 00:35:36,423
Gracias.

305
00:35:36,516 --> 00:35:40,893
- OK, bye, honey. I love you!
- Love you.

306
00:35:45,942 --> 00:35:47,768
I hate leaving her.

307
00:36:01,332 --> 00:36:03,573
Concentrating?

308
00:36:03,668 --> 00:36:05,744
Eyes are closed?

309
00:36:10,008 --> 00:36:11,799
- What happened?
- I flinched.

310
00:36:11,884 --> 00:36:14,291
The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.

311
00:36:14,387 --> 00:36:17,802
- The gunshot holds no fear.
- The gunshot holds no fear! Say it!

312
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:19,596
- The gunshot holds no fear.
- Louder!

313
00:36:19,683 --> 00:36:21,924
- The gunshot holds no fear!
- Louder!

314
00:36:22,018 --> 00:36:25,636
- The gunshot holds no fear!
- That's good. You welcome the sound.

315
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,852
In fact, it's the sound that sets you free.

316
00:36:27,941 --> 00:36:32,318
You are a prisoner on this block until
that sound sets you free. Are you ready?

317
00:36:32,404 --> 00:36:35,108
- Yes.
- Are you ready? Are you set?

318
00:36:43,164 --> 00:36:45,240
Creasy?

319
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:47,658
What's a concubine?

320
00:36:47,752 --> 00:36:51,037
- Why do you ask?
- It's in my history book.

321
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:55,873
- It's like a wife, right?
- Yeah, yeah, it's...

322
00:36:55,969 --> 00:36:58,341
Can I see that? It's kind of a wife.

323
00:36:58,429 --> 00:36:59,804
Right there.

324
00:36:59,889 --> 00:37:03,173
But the Emperor of China had 1,000 ofthem.

325
00:37:04,977 --> 00:37:08,926
OK, like nowadays, in the West,
they have one husband for one wife.

326
00:37:09,022 --> 00:37:15,771
But in the olden-time cultures they had,
you know, different... different rules.

327
00:37:17,572 --> 00:37:19,648
Why? You feel sorry for the husband?

328
00:37:19,741 --> 00:37:23,987
Yeah. Can you imagine my mom
multiplied by a thousand?

329
00:37:25,497 --> 00:37:27,952
Creasy.

330
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:30,662
- You're smiling.
- What?

331
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:32,993
- You were smiling.
- No, I'm not.

332
00:37:33,088 --> 00:37:34,332
- You were.
- No, I was not.

333
00:37:34,422 --> 00:37:37,173
- You're not now, but you were.
- Youwere smiling. I wasn't.

334
00:37:37,258 --> 00:37:38,668
- You were.
- When?

335
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,297
- Five seconds ago.
- I'm not smiling.

336
00:37:41,387 --> 00:37:46,095
- Well, a second ago you were.
- You said five seconds ago. Now that's six.

337
00:37:46,184 --> 00:37:48,389
- Ten seconds ago.
- Ten seconds ago I was smiling.

338
00:37:48,477 --> 00:37:52,557
OK, in the next ten seconds,
we'll see who smiles first.

339
00:37:56,026 --> 00:37:58,517
- You smiled already. See? You did.
- You.

340
00:37:58,612 --> 00:38:01,103
No, that wasn't a... That was a smirk.

341
00:38:01,198 --> 00:38:06,903
That's not a smile. A smirk is different. They
both start with S, but they're not the same...

342
00:38:06,995 --> 00:38:09,782
- Do your homework.
- You were.

343
00:38:12,834 --> 00:38:14,707
Bang!

344
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:18,339
Stop, stop, stop.
Come back, come back.

345
00:38:18,423 --> 00:38:19,703
Bang!

346
00:38:21,343 --> 00:38:23,252
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

347
00:38:23,345 --> 00:38:26,760
Come here. Hurry up, hurry up.

348
00:38:26,848 --> 00:38:28,507
Set.

349
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,091
Bang! Bang!

350
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:38,648
You don't flinch when you hear
the gunshot, understand?

351
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:43,941
Listen for the sound. You don't anticipate.
Concentrate on the sound. Understand me?

352
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:46,107
They're gaining on you. Go, go, go, go!

353
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:50,576
Stop, stop! Come on, get out. Let's go again.

354
00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:09,837
?Yqué? ?Todo bien?
Las maletas, porfavor.

355
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:11,425
- Daddy!
- Come here, girl.

356
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:16,053
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you.

357
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:19,348
I got a surprise for you. Are you ready?

358
00:39:19,898 --> 00:39:21,974
You got me a dog! You got me a dog!

359
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:25,568
- You bought me a dog! Oh, my gosh!
- What do you think?

360
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:29,153
Oh, my gosh.
Just what I wanted. What's his name?

361
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:32,241
- Sam. Like Dad.
- Come on, Sam! Come on, Sam!

362
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:35,946
State...

363
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:41,287
Bhutan. It's a Himalayan kingdom.

364
00:39:41,378 --> 00:39:44,960
They were having some problems
with the royal family not long ago.

365
00:39:45,048 --> 00:39:46,755
OK.

366
00:39:48,635 --> 00:39:51,090
Any more questions?

367
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:56,469
- Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?
- What? No. What kind of question is that?

368
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,845
- You're supposed to be studying history.
- It's Creasy history.

369
00:39:59,938 --> 00:40:02,854
- No, ancient history.
- Who was your very first girlfriend?

370
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,054
- Nonya.
- Nonya?

371
00:40:04,149 --> 00:40:07,600
Nonya business, that's who. OK?

372
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,277
Hi.

373
00:40:10,364 --> 00:40:14,064
Tomorrow after you drop off Pita,
could you take me to get my hair done?

374
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:16,235
Yes, ma'am.

375
00:40:16,328 --> 00:40:19,328
All right. Well, I'll...

376
00:40:19,414 --> 00:40:22,118
I'll leave you to your history.

377
00:40:22,209 --> 00:40:25,126
- Good night.
- Good night, honey.

378
00:40:27,464 --> 00:40:30,037
- OK, now ask me.
- Ask you what?

379
00:40:36,431 --> 00:40:39,515
Go, Pita! Go, go, go, go, go!

380
00:40:39,601 --> 00:40:41,593
!Ràpido!!Ràpido!

381
00:40:41,686 --> 00:40:44,177
Go, go, go, go, go!

382
00:40:44,272 --> 00:40:46,643
!Bravo, Pita!

383
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,141
- 10.99.
- Yes!

384
00:40:53,447 --> 00:40:56,020
- I'm tough, Creasy.
- No such thing as tough.

385
00:40:56,116 --> 00:40:59,484
There's trained and there's untrained.
Now, which are you?

386
00:40:59,578 --> 00:41:03,029
- Trained.
- Trained. OK, we'll go again.

387
00:41:11,381 --> 00:41:13,457
- Here.
- Stand here near the finish line.

388
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:15,174
OK. Hey.

389
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,463
I'm a prisoner in the block
until the gunshot sets me free.

390
00:41:18,555 --> 00:41:22,469
That's right. Don't smile, don't fool around
ifyou wanna win. Trained or untrained?

391
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:24,218
- Trained.
- Go.

392
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:29,978
- Señor Creasy, nice to see you.
- Good to see you, Madre.

393
00:41:30,067 --> 00:41:32,735
Pita's parents are away on business in Juàrez.

394
00:41:32,818 --> 00:41:35,487
Today, you are her father.

395
00:42:58,235 --> 00:43:00,807
!Yla ganadora es Pita Ramos!

396
00:43:06,492 --> 00:43:09,658
I won, Creasy! I won!

397
00:43:09,745 --> 00:43:12,236
- OK.
- I won!

398
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:27,046
- Once upon a time, when we were young...
- When lwas young.

399
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:30,137
Well, when we were young
and he was younger,

400
00:43:30,224 --> 00:43:33,094
and all heads turned our way,

401
00:43:33,185 --> 00:43:35,806
we made a deal to take the world together.

402
00:43:35,896 --> 00:43:39,845
Yeah, then one day I got a call,
and you said...

403
00:43:39,942 --> 00:43:43,357
"I'm in love, I'm in love!"

404
00:43:43,445 --> 00:43:45,899
"And I'm movin' to Mexico!"

405
00:43:45,988 --> 00:43:48,525
And I said, "Huh?"

406
00:43:48,616 --> 00:43:52,150
I said, "What happened to the plan?
What happened to it?"

407
00:43:52,245 --> 00:43:57,072
- I said, "The plan's right here!"
- Yeah, yeah. And what'd I do?

408
00:43:57,166 --> 00:43:59,491
I hung up. And then I met Alicia.

409
00:43:59,585 --> 00:44:03,878
And then I went, "Now I got ya. I got ya."

410
00:44:03,964 --> 00:44:06,751
I got it. Can I kiss her?

411
00:44:06,842 --> 00:44:08,834
Absolutely.

412
00:44:08,928 --> 00:44:11,679
Hey, what are you doin'?

413
00:44:16,143 --> 00:44:20,851
- You got me.
- OK, I think now's as good a time as any.

414
00:44:23,692 --> 00:44:26,443
I bought it with my own money.

415
00:44:28,364 --> 00:44:30,439
Thank you.

416
00:44:32,033 --> 00:44:34,109
Open it.

417
00:44:38,456 --> 00:44:43,034
It's Saint Jude, the patron saint of lost causes.

418
00:44:46,839 --> 00:44:48,831
Well deserved.

419
00:44:52,887 --> 00:44:55,674
Thank you, Pita. It's beautiful.

420
00:44:57,141 --> 00:44:59,217
You're welcome.

421
00:45:48,566 --> 00:45:50,605
- Dad?
- Yes, sweetie?

422
00:45:50,693 --> 00:45:53,266
- Can I talk to you?
- Yes.

423
00:45:54,905 --> 00:45:57,941
I don't wanna play piano, I wanna swim.

424
00:45:58,033 --> 00:46:02,361
It's not open for discussion, honey, OK?
Mr Lozzi's a very, very famous teacher.

425
00:46:02,453 --> 00:46:06,782
If he accepts you as a student,
you're gonna play the piano. Sorry.

426
00:46:06,874 --> 00:46:08,831
- Whatever.
- Baby.

427
00:46:11,379 --> 00:46:14,000
- I love you.
- Love you.

428
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:17,340
- I just want what's best for you, you know?
- OK.

429
00:46:17,427 --> 00:46:19,668
OK, honey.

430
00:46:29,855 --> 00:46:32,642
Ifyou broke all my fingers,
then taped them back together,

431
00:46:32,733 --> 00:46:35,603
I wouldn't be able to play piano,
but I could still swim.

432
00:46:35,695 --> 00:46:37,983
Sam, get back.

433
00:46:38,072 --> 00:46:41,072
Don't be a crybaby.
You're tougher than that.

434
00:46:41,158 --> 00:46:43,233
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

435
00:46:46,496 --> 00:46:49,033
Remember the day you wanted the pencil?

436
00:46:49,124 --> 00:46:52,290
- Yeah.
- I know why.

437
00:46:52,377 --> 00:46:53,919
Yeah?

438
00:46:54,003 --> 00:46:58,664
You wanted the licence number off ofthat car.
I wrote it down in my notebook.

439
00:46:58,758 --> 00:47:01,427
I got it all but the last number.

440
00:47:01,511 --> 00:47:04,761
I'll get it from you later. Can you belch?

441
00:47:04,847 --> 00:47:07,088
Like burp. Can you burp?

442
00:47:11,354 --> 00:47:15,980
- That's good. That's very good.
- I just had a Coke.

443
00:47:16,067 --> 00:47:18,439
Listen to me. This famous teacher...

444
00:47:18,528 --> 00:47:22,608
He teaches a lot of rich kids and plays
for the symphonies and all that, right?

445
00:47:22,698 --> 00:47:25,367
Belch every few minutes
while you're practising.

446
00:47:25,451 --> 00:47:30,277
You apologise to him, but you keep belching.
You'll offend every sensibility he has.

447
00:47:30,372 --> 00:47:34,072
Very good. You'll be back in the pool
in 24 hours, I guarantee you.

448
00:47:34,167 --> 00:47:36,243
Right, Sam?

449
00:47:41,633 --> 00:47:45,381
- Hola.
- Lupita Ramos.

450
00:47:48,556 --> 00:47:50,714
For you, Creasy.

451
00:47:53,978 --> 00:47:55,851
Thank you.

452
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:02,483
- How does this look?
- Good. Good.

453
00:48:04,989 --> 00:48:06,732
- Hola, Pita.
- Hola.

454
00:48:07,241 --> 00:48:07,905
Come on in.

455
00:48:07,992 --> 00:48:09,023
Bye.

456
00:48:09,118 --> 00:48:11,194
- How long?
- One hour.

457
00:48:11,287 --> 00:48:13,159
Gracias.

458
00:48:41,065 --> 00:48:42,724
Pita...

459
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,403
!Pita! Porfavor, concéntrate.

460
00:50:16,825 --> 00:50:17,904
Pita!

461
00:50:20,662 --> 00:50:21,527
Pita!

462
00:50:28,794 --> 00:50:30,537
No te vas a callar.

463
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:33,669
Pita!

464
00:50:42,641 --> 00:50:44,300
Run!

465
00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:05,465
Creasy!

466
00:52:05,554 --> 00:52:07,546
Creasy!

467
00:52:09,683 --> 00:52:11,924
Creasy. Creasy!

468
00:52:12,811 --> 00:52:14,933
Creasy!

469
00:52:27,325 --> 00:52:28,867
I can't...

470
00:52:51,974 --> 00:52:56,682
John W Creasy is under arrest for the murder
oftwo officers ofthe Judicial Police.

471
00:52:56,770 --> 00:52:59,474
Creasy!

472
00:53:08,073 --> 00:53:11,738
This man, John W Creasy,

473
00:53:11,827 --> 00:53:13,451
an American citizen,

474
00:53:13,537 --> 00:53:15,328
is under arrest for the murder

475
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:18,035
oftwo officers ofthe Judicial Police

476
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:23,379
and is suspected of possible involvement

477
00:53:23,463 --> 00:53:26,213
in the kidnapping of Lupita Martin Ramos.

478
00:53:28,384 --> 00:53:31,053
Chief Ramirez...

479
00:53:33,222 --> 00:53:35,759
The two officers who were killed.

480
00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:38,221
Records show they were off duty at the time.

481
00:53:38,936 --> 00:53:41,427
So why were they in uniform

482
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:42,678
and in a patrol car?

483
00:53:42,773 --> 00:53:46,521
All I know is that they died bravely.

484
00:53:47,486 --> 00:53:48,730
Of course,

485
00:53:48,821 --> 00:53:51,525
but what exactly were they doing

486
00:53:51,615 --> 00:53:53,025
at the scene ofthe kidnapping?

487
00:53:53,742 --> 00:53:56,861
Or were they known
for their exceptional good luck?

488
00:53:56,954 --> 00:53:58,946
They were known for being corrupt

489
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:01,494
and now are celebrated for being dead.

490
00:54:58,471 --> 00:55:00,926
Excuse me.

491
00:55:06,645 --> 00:55:08,803
Relax, OK? Relax, Sammy.

492
00:55:14,278 --> 00:55:17,777
I know she's your little girl. When I
tell you everything's gonna be all right,

493
00:55:17,865 --> 00:55:20,534
everything's gonna be all right.

494
00:55:22,202 --> 00:55:24,574
Señor Ramos.

495
00:55:32,588 --> 00:55:35,161
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

496
00:55:35,257 --> 00:55:39,039
Victor Fuentes, Anti-Kidnapping Division,
Policia Judicial.

497
00:55:39,135 --> 00:55:42,753
Excuse me. I'm Jordan Kalfus.
I'm the family attorney.

498
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:48,221
Speak slower, please.
My Russian is better than my English.

499
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:53,137
Well, I'm conducting the negotiations, and we
neither need nor want any police assistance.

500
00:55:53,232 --> 00:55:56,932
We're gonna handle this thing ourselves.

501
00:55:57,695 --> 00:56:04,196
Señor Ramos, two police officers were killed
during your daughter's abduction.

502
00:56:04,285 --> 00:56:07,202
I have a written order from...

503
00:56:07,371 --> 00:56:09,328
the Public Minister...

504
00:56:09,581 --> 00:56:11,573
authorising our participation...

505
00:56:11,667 --> 00:56:14,288
..."unofficially".

506
00:56:15,337 --> 00:56:20,129
Ifyou want to speak to
Attorney General Diaz, it's on me.

507
00:56:22,261 --> 00:56:23,967
OK.

508
00:56:24,053 --> 00:56:28,465
The kidnapper will tell you
to deliver the money alone.

509
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:31,140
Porfavor, don't do that.

510
00:56:31,227 --> 00:56:36,932
Or you will find yourself in a real
Mexican hell. No mariachi, no tequila...

511
00:56:37,024 --> 00:56:39,100
and no Pita.

512
00:57:18,314 --> 00:57:19,345
Crease?

513
00:57:21,442 --> 00:57:22,473
Crease.

514
00:57:25,363 --> 00:57:29,111
When I heard it was this hospital,
I was so pleased.

515
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,782
There is a pastry shop nearby. Delgado's.

516
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:37,081
They have the best pastries in Mexico.

517
00:57:37,166 --> 00:57:41,115
Miguel Manzano. Director ofthe AFl.

518
00:57:41,212 --> 00:57:47,332
And a former director of lnterpol, in Rome.

519
00:57:48,469 --> 00:57:51,837
- And you are?
- A friend of his. Rayburn.

520
00:57:51,931 --> 00:57:53,756
Rayburn.

521
00:58:07,612 --> 00:58:09,106
?Hola?

522
00:58:09,238 --> 00:58:11,942
Do you love your daughter, señor Ramos?

523
00:58:12,033 --> 00:58:14,155
Yes. Yes.

524
00:58:14,243 --> 00:58:17,446
- Do you want to see her again?
- Yes, I do.

525
00:58:17,538 --> 00:58:18,866
Señor...

526
00:58:19,874 --> 00:58:24,785
Ifyour daughter's life is
as important to you as it is to me,

527
00:58:24,879 --> 00:58:27,204
you will do as I say.

528
00:58:27,298 --> 00:58:29,337
Yes?

529
00:58:29,425 --> 00:58:30,967
OK, yes.

530
00:58:31,635 --> 00:58:33,757
Crease. You hear me?

531
00:58:37,265 --> 00:58:39,506
You got four of 'em, all dead.

532
00:58:41,311 --> 00:58:44,395
- Pita?
- It's...

533
00:58:46,274 --> 00:58:48,895
It's been two days.

534
00:58:48,985 --> 00:58:51,820
They're negotiating a ransom.

535
00:58:53,281 --> 00:58:56,899
These things take time, Mr Creasy.

536
00:59:01,497 --> 00:59:03,121
Crease.

537
00:59:05,334 --> 00:59:08,251
Don't fuck with me, all right?

538
00:59:13,801 --> 00:59:17,216
You have the ten million?
Do you have the money?

539
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:21,087
- Yes, we have the money.
- Now, ifyou do as I say,

540
00:59:21,183 --> 00:59:25,559
the girl will be returned
exactly as she was taken.

541
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:29,773
But ifyou deviate
from the process in any way...

542
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:32,350
By the Virgin of Guadeloupe,

543
00:59:32,443 --> 00:59:34,934
I swear you will never see her again.

544
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:38,148
I understand. Listen, I too
worship la Virgen de Guadalupe...

545
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:40,280
I ask ifyou understand.

546
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:46,371
Hello, sir. This is Mr Ramos's attorney.

547
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:49,410
He's going through a very difficult time,
but he understands.

548
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:52,870
Do you understand?
Repeat the drop instructions.

549
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:58,124
OK, the money, ten million US, will be divided
into two 15-gallon black canvas bags,

550
00:59:58,219 --> 01:00:02,548
each containing five million, which
will be checked at the bank by the KR agent,

551
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:07,265
then driven to the house in an armoured car,
where it will be transferred to the delivery car.

552
01:00:08,103 --> 01:00:10,890
You got a flat tyre here.

553
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:13,056
This is for you.

554
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:16,522
Hello. Yeah.

555
01:00:16,611 --> 01:00:19,184
Listen, I need a driver to drive Samuel.

556
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,521
No. Why?

557
01:00:21,616 --> 01:00:25,447
He's got a bad ticker.
He's got a heart condition.

558
01:00:25,536 --> 01:00:28,739
Look, he's a nervous kid.
He doesn't respond well to stress.

559
01:00:30,875 --> 01:00:35,536
All right, but the car will not be powerful.

560
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:40,706
Remove the trunk lid.
Use the maid's Valiant Acapulco.

561
01:00:41,469 --> 01:00:45,300
You will arrive at La Diana fountain at 1am.

562
01:00:45,389 --> 01:00:49,552
You will drive around the circle two times.

563
01:00:49,644 --> 01:00:54,554
Samuel will remove his shirt
and hold it out the window to ID the car.

564
01:00:54,648 --> 01:00:57,601
to ID the car.

565
01:00:58,693 --> 01:01:02,441
There is a payphone on the southeast corner.

566
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:08,365
The phone will ring.
You will answer and wait for instructions.

567
01:01:08,453 --> 01:01:13,364
There is a map on the top
ofthe phone. Follow it.

568
01:01:15,376 --> 01:01:17,285
Perfecto.

569
01:01:17,378 --> 01:01:19,869
Tranquilo. Si.

570
01:01:21,299 --> 01:01:24,299
- What are you doing? He said no phones.
- Relax, relax.

571
01:01:24,385 --> 01:01:28,216
I'm just trying to protect your daughter, OK?

572
01:01:33,144 --> 01:01:34,306
What's goin' on?

573
01:01:34,645 --> 01:01:37,479
Hospitals can be very dangerous places,

574
01:01:37,564 --> 01:01:41,513
especially when you have
killed two corrupt cops.

575
01:01:53,913 --> 01:01:57,862
Leave the money in the trunk ofthe white car

576
01:01:57,959 --> 01:02:00,035
and return to your car.

577
01:02:01,838 --> 01:02:05,171
Do not look back.

578
01:02:14,017 --> 01:02:15,676
What's going on, guys?

579
01:02:15,768 --> 01:02:17,345
Ambush!

580
01:02:23,442 --> 01:02:27,273
Remember... I'm a professional.

581
01:02:27,571 --> 01:02:35,198
Ifyou keep your word, I will keep mine.

582
01:02:44,546 --> 01:02:46,704
- Hello?
- Mr Ramos.

583
01:02:46,798 --> 01:02:50,332
You betrayed me. You killed my nephew.

584
01:02:50,969 --> 01:02:52,593
You took my money.

585
01:02:52,679 --> 01:02:54,671
Señor Ramos...

586
01:02:54,848 --> 01:02:57,718
God be with your child.

587
01:02:59,644 --> 01:03:04,518
All right. Get outta here, all ofyou.
Get the fuck out of my house!

588
01:03:04,606 --> 01:03:06,894
OK, this is Lisa...

589
01:03:07,776 --> 01:03:10,563
Martin Ramos. I'm Pita's mother.

590
01:03:12,072 --> 01:03:16,947
And I'm very sorry for whatever happened
to your nephew, but I beg you...

591
01:03:17,035 --> 01:03:20,119
Please don't harm my daughter.

592
01:03:21,832 --> 01:03:24,702
This conversation is not being recorded.

593
01:03:24,793 --> 01:03:27,165
You're negotiating directly with me.

594
01:03:27,254 --> 01:03:32,877
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I wish we had talked sooner, señora.

595
01:03:32,968 --> 01:03:35,672
I'm really sorry.

596
01:03:36,388 --> 01:03:38,464
Now it is too late.

597
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:52,768
Fuck off! Get the fuck out
of my fucking house! Now!

598
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:56,571
Get out! Get out!

599
01:04:44,956 --> 01:04:47,909
Hey, Ray. How are you...?

600
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:54,036
- Where am l?
- Well, it looks like a dog hospital.

601
01:04:58,386 --> 01:05:01,920
Manzano was afraid
the cops were gonna kill ya.

602
01:05:02,974 --> 01:05:05,050
How you doin', doc?

603
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:12,182
What's the matter?

604
01:05:15,403 --> 01:05:17,691
She's dead, Crease.

605
01:05:20,032 --> 01:05:24,740
It's a mess. Somebody
hijacked the drop and...

606
01:05:28,582 --> 01:05:33,078
The kidnapper's nephew was killed,
so he killed Pita.

607
01:05:45,515 --> 01:05:49,133
He has gunshot wounds
to the chest and the abdomen.

608
01:05:49,519 --> 01:05:51,511
He has a collapsed lung
which we've re-inflated.

609
01:05:51,605 --> 01:05:55,816
He's lucky to be alive.
If he doesn't rest, he will die.

610
01:05:58,570 --> 01:06:00,147
How long will he be hospitalised?

611
01:06:00,238 --> 01:06:02,147
Approximately a month.

612
01:06:04,658 --> 01:06:06,567
No.

613
01:06:14,418 --> 01:06:16,291
No.

614
01:06:21,341 --> 01:06:24,544
Did you recognise any ofthese men?

615
01:06:25,762 --> 01:06:30,305
No. Does that make me a suspect?

616
01:06:31,059 --> 01:06:33,016
No.

617
01:06:33,103 --> 01:06:35,179
It would be convenient, but no.

618
01:06:36,481 --> 01:06:40,561
Maybe you should show me pictures of some
Mexican cops. Maybe we'll get somewhere.

619
01:06:40,652 --> 01:06:43,059
Those were all policemen.

620
01:06:43,154 --> 01:06:46,238
Bad Judicial cops,

621
01:06:46,324 --> 01:06:50,652
protected, by a brotherhood.

622
01:06:50,744 --> 01:06:52,653
A brotherhood?

623
01:06:54,248 --> 01:06:57,996
A brotherhood, called...

624
01:07:13,975 --> 01:07:16,596
You all set?

625
01:07:16,686 --> 01:07:18,345
- Right arm.
- Yeah.

626
01:07:21,441 --> 01:07:23,932
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

627
01:07:24,027 --> 01:07:26,149
Let's go.

628
01:08:02,814 --> 01:08:04,972
- Somebody's on us.
- Yeah.

629
01:08:05,942 --> 01:08:07,601
Lois Lane.

630
01:08:08,362 --> 01:08:11,612
Mariana something, works for Reforma.

631
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,944
Newspaperjournalist.

632
01:08:15,035 --> 01:08:18,284
I guess she thinks you're a scoop.

633
01:08:19,997 --> 01:08:21,621
I'll get you up to the border.

634
01:08:21,707 --> 01:08:25,158
A friend will take you to San Diego,
drop you at the Naval Hospital.

635
01:08:25,252 --> 01:08:27,659
I'm not goin', Ray.

636
01:08:27,755 --> 01:08:30,246
What are you gonna do?

637
01:08:30,341 --> 01:08:34,006
Let's take a ride by the crime scene.
She can follow us.

638
01:08:43,145 --> 01:08:45,221
Buenos dias.

639
01:09:45,205 --> 01:09:47,529
Mr Creasy?

640
01:09:47,623 --> 01:09:50,374
A lot of people are looking for you.

641
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:54,033
I'm Mariana Garcia Guerrero.

642
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:57,335
Reporter, for Reforma.

643
01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:02,382
Nice to meet you.

644
01:10:02,471 --> 01:10:04,428
I found this across the street.

645
01:10:08,102 --> 01:10:09,726
Open it.

646
01:10:13,399 --> 01:10:16,103
It's Santa Muerte. Death worship.

647
01:10:20,072 --> 01:10:23,606
- They've put a curse on you.
- A little late.

648
01:10:27,621 --> 01:10:31,949
- What are you going to do?
- I'm gonna get in my truck and leave.

649
01:10:35,127 --> 01:10:37,499
I can help you.

650
01:10:39,382 --> 01:10:43,593
There's a brotherhood called La Hermandad.

651
01:10:43,678 --> 01:10:47,545
It protects government officials,
corrupt police and organised crime

652
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:52,136
at a level that is too difficult for me to reach.

653
01:10:52,228 --> 01:10:53,770
OK.

654
01:10:53,854 --> 01:10:59,559
And I think that you and Lupita Ramos
are victims ofthis organisation.

655
01:10:59,652 --> 01:11:06,188
I want to expose them. Talk to me, give me
your story, and then I can help you. Please.

656
01:11:10,746 --> 01:11:13,034
Help me do what?

657
01:11:13,999 --> 01:11:17,117
You're gonna help me do what?

658
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:21,494
- You're a stranger here, no?
- That's right.

659
01:11:21,589 --> 01:11:25,966
You're going to need friends
that know their way around.

660
01:11:26,052 --> 01:11:28,128
OK.

661
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:30,757
OK, friend that's gonna help me.

662
01:11:33,142 --> 01:11:35,264
Pleasure to meet you.

663
01:11:35,353 --> 01:11:39,813
Tell your driver to keep his distance
next time. All right, friend?

664
01:11:43,068 --> 01:11:45,060
Si.

665
01:12:01,627 --> 01:12:06,087
- You'll be Stateside by supper time.
- I'm gonna need some help first, though.

666
01:12:06,174 --> 01:12:09,258
You don't stop bleeding,
you won't last a day in your shape.

667
01:12:09,343 --> 01:12:13,471
- Is that a yes or is that a no?
- Yeah! But...

668
01:12:13,556 --> 01:12:15,678
- I'm done killing. I told you that.
- OK.

669
01:12:15,766 --> 01:12:17,723
Anything else is yours.

670
01:12:24,150 --> 01:12:28,728
- You're talkin' about war, Crease.
- Exactly. Can you help me?

671
01:12:31,615 --> 01:12:33,488
- Yeah.
- Good.

672
01:13:48,356 --> 01:13:50,432
Creasy?

673
01:14:44,869 --> 01:14:47,442
What are you doin' here?

674
01:14:54,962 --> 01:14:57,369
I came to get my stuff.

675
01:14:57,465 --> 01:15:00,915
Couldn't find my Bible.
I thought it might be in here.

676
01:15:01,009 --> 01:15:04,543
- I borrowed it.
- OK.

677
01:15:06,056 --> 01:15:08,013
It's crazy, huh?

678
01:15:08,933 --> 01:15:13,476
One week we're figuring out which
nightclub to go to, and the next thing I'm...

679
01:15:13,563 --> 01:15:15,685
readin' the Bible.

680
01:15:15,773 --> 01:15:18,442
It's a good thing. You hold on to it.

681
01:15:22,989 --> 01:15:27,816
I keep thinkin' if only we hadn't...

682
01:15:30,747 --> 01:15:32,823
It's like...

683
01:15:34,959 --> 01:15:41,412
My whole life all I've ever thought about
was what I could get for myself.

684
01:15:41,507 --> 01:15:44,423
Not my own baby.

685
01:15:46,803 --> 01:15:54,383
She needed me so much, and sometimes
I felt like I had nothin' to give her.

686
01:15:54,477 --> 01:15:57,477
Just... I don't know what to do.

687
01:16:00,066 --> 01:16:03,648
- What are you gonna do?
- What I do best.

688
01:16:03,736 --> 01:16:05,812
I'm gonna kill 'em.

689
01:16:06,823 --> 01:16:13,536
Anyone that was involved, who profited
from it, anybody who opens their eyes at me.

690
01:16:13,621 --> 01:16:15,530
You kill 'em all.

691
01:16:44,776 --> 01:16:46,852
Yla Browning.

692
01:17:18,767 --> 01:17:20,558
Reforma Newspaper

693
01:17:20,644 --> 01:17:26,682
Mariana Guerrero,
tiene llamada telefonica. Pase a la cabina.

694
01:17:26,775 --> 01:17:28,933
?Puedo usarsu teléfono?

695
01:17:30,028 --> 01:17:32,863
- ?Hola?
- Yeah, it's me.

696
01:17:33,573 --> 01:17:37,356
- Mr Creasy.
- I need the licence... No, excuse me.

697
01:17:37,452 --> 01:17:42,528
I need the name and address of someone
whose licence number is C5TK8.

698
01:17:42,624 --> 01:17:46,455
That's C5TK8.

699
01:17:46,544 --> 01:17:50,624
I got everything but the last digit,
so I need ten possible matches.

700
01:17:50,715 --> 01:17:53,040
And when do I find out which ofthe ten it is?

701
01:17:53,134 --> 01:17:55,921
- Eventually.
- But where do I reach you?

702
01:17:56,012 --> 01:17:58,087
I'll call you.

703
01:18:03,477 --> 01:18:08,304
AGENCY FOR FEDERAL INVESTIGATION
MEXICO CITY

704
01:18:09,191 --> 01:18:10,733
Do you know who he is?

705
01:18:10,817 --> 01:18:13,687
Do you know what he's been doing
the last 16 years?

706
01:18:14,529 --> 01:18:16,106
Counter-insurgency work in Thailand,

707
01:18:16,198 --> 01:18:17,396
Pakistan...

708
01:18:17,491 --> 01:18:20,195
Jordan, Angola, Lebanon.
Yes, I know all ofthat.

709
01:18:20,285 --> 01:18:21,565
He's an assassin...

710
01:18:21,661 --> 01:18:25,872
and you want to help him identify
the owner of a car for him?

711
01:18:26,499 --> 01:18:29,832
He can go places we can't.

712
01:18:30,879 --> 01:18:33,796
Ifyou don't want to use him... I will.

713
01:18:36,426 --> 01:18:38,667
- Mariana...
- ?Si?

714
01:18:38,762 --> 01:18:41,050
When do I get to sleep with you again?

715
01:18:41,139 --> 01:18:42,715
We never sleep. We fuck.

716
01:18:42,806 --> 01:18:44,513
Give it to me.

717
01:18:45,517 --> 01:18:47,675
Give it to me.

718
01:18:47,769 --> 01:18:50,141
Gracias.

719
01:18:51,982 --> 01:18:53,559
Ciao.

720
01:19:27,141 --> 01:19:28,172
Maneja.

721
01:19:28,267 --> 01:19:30,010
Jorge Gonzàlez.

722
01:19:31,603 --> 01:19:33,227
I'm a Judicial Policeman.

723
01:19:33,689 --> 01:19:36,773
Drive.

724
01:19:36,859 --> 01:19:39,231
OK. Maneja.

725
01:20:04,344 --> 01:20:06,632
What are you gonna do?

726
01:20:06,721 --> 01:20:09,128
What I do best.

727
01:20:10,849 --> 01:20:15,012
Anyone that was involved, who profited
from it, anybody who opens their eyes at me.

728
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:17,180
I'm gonna kill 'em.

729
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:01,804
Can you hear me?

730
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:03,263
My head hurts.

731
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:09,070
I am going to ask questions.

732
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:13,656
Ifyou don't answer fully and truthfully,

733
01:21:13,744 --> 01:21:16,151
you will suffer much more than you have to.

734
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:19,244
I'm going to cut your fingers off.

735
01:21:25,088 --> 01:21:27,792
One by one, if I have to.

736
01:21:28,842 --> 01:21:31,000
This is to stop the bleeding.

737
01:21:32,346 --> 01:21:34,468
OK? Ahora.

738
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:36,881
Don't mess with me.

739
01:21:36,975 --> 01:21:39,181
?Sabes quién soyyo?

740
01:21:39,269 --> 01:21:42,055
You know who I am?

741
01:21:43,481 --> 01:21:46,054
A member of La Hermandad.

742
01:21:47,318 --> 01:21:50,069
- ?Correcto?
- Correct.

743
01:21:50,571 --> 01:21:51,851
OK.

744
01:22:01,832 --> 01:22:05,960
!No mames!
!No me quemes, pendejo de mierda!

745
01:22:06,044 --> 01:22:07,206
!Suelta!

746
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:19,798
- Chinga a tu madre, pinche pendejo.
- Yeah. Ytù. Ytù.

747
01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:28,511
What do you want to know?

748
01:22:29,358 --> 01:22:30,733
The Ramos kidnapping...

749
01:22:32,528 --> 01:22:35,979
What went wrong at the drop?

750
01:22:37,408 --> 01:22:39,234
No sé nada.

751
01:22:39,326 --> 01:22:42,113
We were just ordered to take her.

752
01:22:42,871 --> 01:22:44,697
That's all we did.

753
01:22:45,791 --> 01:22:46,704
Ordered by who?

754
01:22:47,042 --> 01:22:48,322
I don't know.

755
01:22:48,669 --> 01:22:50,994
You don't know?

756
01:22:51,088 --> 01:22:54,338
!No sé!!No sé!

757
01:22:56,635 --> 01:22:57,915
!No sé!!No sé!

758
01:22:58,011 --> 01:22:59,339
We work in separate groups.

759
01:22:59,430 --> 01:23:00,509
A voice calls.

760
01:23:00,597 --> 01:23:01,711
We grab the target

761
01:23:01,807 --> 01:23:04,891
and deliver it to the guardians.

762
01:23:08,689 --> 01:23:10,431
The bosses never see the target,

763
01:23:10,773 --> 01:23:12,350
theyjust make the deal.

764
01:23:12,441 --> 01:23:14,599
!Eso es todo!

765
01:23:14,694 --> 01:23:16,982
Who ordered it?

766
01:23:21,992 --> 01:23:23,071
We call him "The Voice".

767
01:23:23,619 --> 01:23:25,161
"The Voice." OK.

768
01:23:25,746 --> 01:23:26,908
"The Voice", si.

769
01:23:28,290 --> 01:23:29,665
The Voice.

770
01:23:31,252 --> 01:23:32,580
The Voice. How do I find him?

771
01:23:39,009 --> 01:23:41,131
You don't know?

772
01:23:42,221 --> 01:23:44,094
Are you sure?

773
01:23:50,312 --> 01:23:52,103
OK.

774
01:23:53,148 --> 01:23:55,223
OK.

775
01:23:57,401 --> 01:24:00,604
I believe you.

776
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:14,159
Tell me about the guardians.

777
01:24:18,297 --> 01:24:19,956
I'm a professional.

778
01:24:21,175 --> 01:24:23,844
I'm a professional. I just do myjob.

779
01:24:27,014 --> 01:24:30,180
Tell me about the guardians.

780
01:24:33,395 --> 01:24:36,395
- Guardianes.
- Guardianes, OK. Guardianes.

781
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:42,354
You don't know?

782
01:24:42,445 --> 01:24:44,521
I don't know.

783
01:24:47,575 --> 01:24:49,733
!No me mates, cabron!

784
01:24:49,827 --> 01:24:52,697
!Ya déjame en paz, cabron!

785
01:24:57,627 --> 01:25:00,118
He works the door at a rave in Neza.

786
01:25:00,212 --> 01:25:01,243
He has a mark

787
01:25:01,339 --> 01:25:03,296
on the left side of his face.

788
01:25:03,382 --> 01:25:05,754
They call him "The Butcher".

789
01:25:06,969 --> 01:25:08,048
Is he La Hermandad?

790
01:25:08,471 --> 01:25:10,759
Yes, La Hermandad.

791
01:25:14,059 --> 01:25:15,387
OK.

792
01:25:15,477 --> 01:25:18,050
Wait, wait, wait.

793
01:25:19,273 --> 01:25:21,395
Give me one cigarette, please, eh?

794
01:25:21,483 --> 01:25:23,807
Si.

795
01:25:24,861 --> 01:25:27,149
OK.

796
01:25:29,157 --> 01:25:31,363
?Bueno?

797
01:25:32,952 --> 01:25:34,446
OK, my friend.

798
01:25:35,621 --> 01:25:38,408
It's offto the next life for you.

799
01:25:39,792 --> 01:25:42,911
I guarantee you won't be lonely.

800
01:26:06,902 --> 01:26:10,732
Revenge is a meal best served cold.

801
01:26:56,950 --> 01:26:59,785
The Rave - Neza

802
01:27:46,414 --> 01:27:48,572
Tell me about the girl.

803
01:27:48,666 --> 01:27:49,910
I don't know her.

804
01:27:50,001 --> 01:27:52,123
- !La niña!
- No.

805
01:27:53,630 --> 01:27:54,459
!Vamos!

806
01:28:27,871 --> 01:28:29,069
?Qué hay?

807
01:28:38,756 --> 01:28:41,247
OK, OK. Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

808
01:28:46,014 --> 01:28:47,638
Tell me about the girl.

809
01:28:52,687 --> 01:28:53,682
Do you know her?

810
01:28:57,859 --> 01:28:59,602
No?

811
01:29:14,374 --> 01:29:18,667
Hey, man, I heard you speaking Spanish
over there. You're American, right?

812
01:29:18,753 --> 01:29:20,626
- And so are you.
- Yeah.

813
01:29:20,714 --> 01:29:23,205
- Get outta here. Where you from?
- New Jersey.

814
01:29:23,299 --> 01:29:25,505
New Jersey? I'm from New Jersey.

815
01:29:25,593 --> 01:29:27,087
All right, listen to me.

816
01:29:27,178 --> 01:29:30,131
Tell me how it works. The whole thing.
Tell me how it works.

817
01:29:30,223 --> 01:29:32,760
All right, everything is done by cellphone.

818
01:29:32,851 --> 01:29:36,350
You just wait around for calls.
We don't even have a fuckin' number.

819
01:29:36,437 --> 01:29:38,513
- Who pays you?
- We got an ATM card.

820
01:29:38,606 --> 01:29:43,682
We take out 200 fuckin' measly dollars
every two weeks.

821
01:29:45,363 --> 01:29:46,691
- 200 dollars?
- Yeah.

822
01:29:46,781 --> 01:29:49,734
- OK. What's the PIN number?
- The what?

823
01:29:49,826 --> 01:29:53,240
- The PIN number, code number.
- Yeah, it's 4747.

824
01:29:55,414 --> 01:29:56,576
- Yeah.
- Good.

825
01:29:56,665 --> 01:29:58,538
- You wouldn't lie to me?
- I'm not lyin'.

826
01:29:58,625 --> 01:30:00,664
- You didn't kill her, did you?
- No.

827
01:30:04,214 --> 01:30:05,209
Don't lie to me!

828
01:30:05,298 --> 01:30:09,247
- Don't lie to me! Did you kill her?
- You're makin' me fuckin' nervous.

829
01:30:09,344 --> 01:30:12,261
- Did you kill her?
- No! The fuckin' boss did, or his brother.

830
01:30:12,389 --> 01:30:14,465
Who's the boss?

831
01:30:15,225 --> 01:30:17,680
- We never see his face.
- You're lyin' to me.

832
01:30:18,478 --> 01:30:20,020
I'm tellin' you the truth!

833
01:30:20,105 --> 01:30:21,729
Who? You never seen whose face?

834
01:30:21,815 --> 01:30:24,222
Well, we were in the other room.

835
01:30:25,151 --> 01:30:30,940
And he was yellin' at the girl cos his nephew
got killed and the money got stolen.

836
01:30:31,032 --> 01:30:34,650
- Wait. Somebody stole what money?
- The ransom money at the drop.

837
01:30:34,744 --> 01:30:37,660
- Who stole it?
- He said some fuckin' crooked cop took it.

838
01:30:37,746 --> 01:30:39,453
- Who?
- Fuentes.

839
01:30:39,539 --> 01:30:41,661
- Fuentes?
- Yeah, that's him.

840
01:30:42,876 --> 01:30:44,749
All right?

841
01:30:44,836 --> 01:30:47,409
- Jersey boy?
- Yeah.

842
01:30:50,759 --> 01:30:52,502
- This Fuentes guy...
- Yeah?

843
01:30:53,553 --> 01:30:55,960
He's a lieutenant
for the Anti-Kidnapping Division.

844
01:30:56,056 --> 01:30:57,004
- Fuentes is?
- Yeah.

845
01:30:57,098 --> 01:30:59,553
- What'd you do?
- Oh, man.

846
01:30:59,643 --> 01:31:02,643
Tell me about the girl. What did you do?

847
01:31:02,729 --> 01:31:05,398
- I just do what they tell me.
- You do what they tell you to do?

848
01:31:05,482 --> 01:31:08,482
Did you say goodbye to her?
Answer. Did you say goodbye to her?

849
01:31:08,568 --> 01:31:10,062
- No!
- You didn't?

850
01:31:10,153 --> 01:31:12,394
- Here's your chance. Say goodbye.
- Oh, shit.

851
01:31:12,489 --> 01:31:15,359
Say goodbye to her. Say goodbye to her.

852
01:31:15,450 --> 01:31:17,407
Motherfucker, let me go!

853
01:31:20,329 --> 01:31:21,704
?Hijo?

854
01:31:37,971 --> 01:31:40,212
They threw the little girl against the wall.

855
01:31:40,307 --> 01:31:44,600
She wasn't moving.

856
01:31:45,770 --> 01:31:49,185
They threw her body in the trunk ofthe car,

857
01:31:50,358 --> 01:31:52,480
and then they drove away.

858
01:31:52,569 --> 01:31:55,404
Who? Who? Who's they?

859
01:31:56,781 --> 01:31:58,440
The boss's brother.

860
01:32:00,035 --> 01:32:02,323
I recognised his voice.

861
01:32:02,871 --> 01:32:05,158
OK. OK.

862
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:09,698
Now listen to me.

863
01:32:09,793 --> 01:32:13,078
Ifyou tell me where to find the boss,

864
01:32:15,757 --> 01:32:17,132
I'll let you live.

865
01:32:18,927 --> 01:32:21,003
But I don't know.

866
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:26,843
I'll give you the girl.

867
01:32:28,562 --> 01:32:30,388
I'll give you the girl.

868
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:32,638
What girl?

869
01:32:33,150 --> 01:32:33,896
The girl...

870
01:32:34,484 --> 01:32:36,310
Do you want the girl?

871
01:32:36,987 --> 01:32:40,237
Yes, yes, but what girl?
What are you saying?

872
01:32:40,323 --> 01:32:41,781
- The girl.
- Here?

873
01:32:41,866 --> 01:32:42,779
Si.

874
01:32:45,578 --> 01:32:46,407
You sure?

875
01:32:46,496 --> 01:32:47,694
Si.

876
01:32:49,915 --> 01:32:51,325
Show me.

877
01:34:23,839 --> 01:34:25,997
- Si. Guerrero.
- Listen, it's me.

878
01:34:26,091 --> 01:34:30,254
Do you know about a young girl being
kidnapped recently, about 12 years old?

879
01:34:30,346 --> 01:34:34,343
- Yes, last night. Do you know something?
- What's her name?

880
01:34:34,433 --> 01:34:36,425
Camila. Camila Valencias.

881
01:34:37,561 --> 01:34:40,727
- ?Camila? ?Se llama Camila?
- Si.

882
01:34:40,814 --> 01:34:43,221
- I got her.
- Where are you?

883
01:35:13,512 --> 01:35:18,008
- Creasy, what happened?
- It's OK. Sit down, relax.

884
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:20,887
- Camila, ?estàs bien?
- She's OK, she's OK.

885
01:35:20,978 --> 01:35:23,551
You got banking connections?

886
01:35:23,647 --> 01:35:25,639
Yes, I have connections.

887
01:35:28,318 --> 01:35:34,153
PIN number's 4747. I wanna find out
who's puttin' money in that account.

888
01:35:34,241 --> 01:35:36,566
4747.

889
01:35:38,537 --> 01:35:40,778
What do you know
about a cop named Fuentes?

890
01:35:40,873 --> 01:35:45,250
He's with the Anti-Kidnapping Division.
He drove Samuel Ramos to the drop.

891
01:35:45,335 --> 01:35:48,500
- Fuentes?
- Who is she?

892
01:35:48,587 --> 01:35:50,994
You can ask her later.
She'll tell you anything.

893
01:35:51,090 --> 01:35:53,627
What do you know about Fuentes?

894
01:35:53,718 --> 01:35:57,881
Three years ago they caught him with $50,000
and a dead body in the trunk of his car.

895
01:35:57,972 --> 01:36:03,844
Never charged. The arresting officer
couldn't testify cos he was dead.

896
01:36:03,936 --> 01:36:06,177
Was he La Hermandad?

897
01:36:06,272 --> 01:36:11,646
- You know where he lives?
- He lives in a Judicial compound.

898
01:36:11,735 --> 01:36:14,688
He travels by motorcade.

899
01:36:17,491 --> 01:36:20,160
He's better protected
than the president of Mexico.

900
01:36:20,244 --> 01:36:22,450
He's gonna need it.
Can you take care of her?

901
01:36:22,538 --> 01:36:25,455
- Yes, but how can I find you?
- I'll find you.

902
01:36:53,150 --> 01:36:55,308
This is myjurisdiction.

903
01:36:57,071 --> 01:37:00,486
I want this man as much as Creasy does.

904
01:37:01,617 --> 01:37:06,243
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend
than ten years ofyour courts and tribunals.

905
01:37:06,330 --> 01:37:08,488
Just stay out of his way.

906
01:37:08,582 --> 01:37:10,241
I plan to.

907
01:37:17,799 --> 01:37:20,290
I will even help him, if I can.

908
01:37:21,511 --> 01:37:25,425
But... I'd like to understand him.

909
01:37:27,934 --> 01:37:30,175
Give me that.

910
01:37:30,269 --> 01:37:32,345
Pita Ramos...

911
01:37:33,856 --> 01:37:36,228
is a number to you.

912
01:37:36,317 --> 01:37:40,184
One more dead, but a number.

913
01:37:40,988 --> 01:37:45,815
- What was she to Creasy, then?
- She showed him it was all right to live again.

914
01:37:48,787 --> 01:37:52,120
And the kidnappers took that away, huh?

915
01:37:53,083 --> 01:37:58,587
And they're gonna wish
they never touched a hair on her head.

916
01:37:59,173 --> 01:38:01,876
A man can be an artist...

917
01:38:04,719 --> 01:38:07,470
at anything - food, whatever.

918
01:38:07,555 --> 01:38:12,098
It depends on how good he is at it.

919
01:38:15,188 --> 01:38:17,264
Creasy's art is death.

920
01:38:20,026 --> 01:38:23,026
He's about to paint his masterpiece.

921
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:34,037
I don't have anything else to say.

922
01:38:59,647 --> 01:39:04,190
I need the accounts linked to this card.

923
01:39:09,282 --> 01:39:14,193
PIN number is 4747.

924
01:39:14,912 --> 01:39:18,363
On one condition.

925
01:40:03,668 --> 01:40:07,451
I'm not here to hurt you.

926
01:40:21,101 --> 01:40:23,592
In the church, they say to forgive.

927
01:40:23,686 --> 01:40:26,058
Forgiveness is between them and God.

928
01:40:26,147 --> 01:40:29,064
It's myjob to arrange the meeting.

929
01:42:26,305 --> 01:42:28,096
Don't move. Put your hands down.

930
01:42:38,024 --> 01:42:40,431
Señor John W Creasy is under arrest

931
01:42:40,527 --> 01:42:43,314
for the murder oftwo officers
ofthe Judicial Police...

932
01:42:43,405 --> 01:42:46,524
Creasy!

933
01:42:46,616 --> 01:42:48,240
Creasy!

934
01:43:21,817 --> 01:43:24,189
Can you hear me? Huh?

935
01:43:26,112 --> 01:43:28,270
You know where we are?

936
01:43:29,366 --> 01:43:31,691
We're under the bridge

937
01:43:31,785 --> 01:43:36,696
where the deal went bad
and the ransom got stolen.

938
01:43:36,790 --> 01:43:38,747
You wanna tell me what happened?

939
01:43:38,833 --> 01:43:41,370
- You've heard of La Hermandad?
- Yes, I have.

940
01:43:41,461 --> 01:43:43,537
- You know what it is?
- Yes.

941
01:43:43,671 --> 01:43:45,959
I'm the president of La Hermandad.

942
01:43:46,049 --> 01:43:47,424
- You're the president?
- Yes.

943
01:43:47,509 --> 01:43:49,750
The president? Wow.

944
01:43:50,970 --> 01:43:53,046
Look at me.

945
01:43:53,139 --> 01:43:56,590
Oh, you can't. I'm sorry. How's that?

946
01:44:06,652 --> 01:44:08,893
I'll show you what I got here.

947
01:44:08,987 --> 01:44:11,359
See this? This is a charger.

948
01:44:11,448 --> 01:44:14,365
It's used by convicts
to hide money and drugs.

949
01:44:14,451 --> 01:44:19,362
They stick it in their body, they tuck it
up their rectum. You familiar with that?

950
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:22,373
This... Look at me. Pencil detonator.

951
01:44:22,459 --> 01:44:26,587
Timer. Used as a receiver, a transmitter.

952
01:44:27,631 --> 01:44:30,667
C4. Highly explosive.

953
01:44:30,759 --> 01:44:33,000
You put 'em all together, you got a bomb.

954
01:44:33,094 --> 01:44:37,590
Not very sophisticated, but very powerful.

955
01:44:37,682 --> 01:44:40,469
That's what you have in your ass right now.

956
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:42,766
Don't move. Don't move.

957
01:44:42,854 --> 01:44:44,015
Don't move.

958
01:44:48,233 --> 01:44:50,439
Cheap watch, pager watch,

959
01:44:50,527 --> 01:44:56,612
used to send a page to the receiver
that's up your behind right now.

960
01:44:56,700 --> 01:44:57,862
So...

961
01:44:57,951 --> 01:45:01,818
I'm gonna send you a page
which you will receive...

962
01:45:03,832 --> 01:45:06,453
in five minutes.

963
01:45:08,086 --> 01:45:09,829
Now...

964
01:45:14,134 --> 01:45:17,051
You got less than five minutes
to tell me what went down

965
01:45:17,137 --> 01:45:19,462
between your men and the kidnapper.

966
01:45:19,556 --> 01:45:21,797
I have nothing to do with the kidnapper.

967
01:45:21,891 --> 01:45:25,094
- Four minutes and 30 seconds.
- Nothing. I don't know him.

968
01:45:25,186 --> 01:45:28,767
You don't know?
Four minutes and 25 seconds.

969
01:45:30,858 --> 01:45:34,772
Four minutes and 20 seconds. Are you sure?

970
01:45:35,779 --> 01:45:37,522
OK.

971
01:45:38,574 --> 01:45:41,907
I got all the time in the world.
You don't, but I do.

972
01:45:41,994 --> 01:45:44,781
- Relax, relax, buddy.
- I'm relaxed.

973
01:45:44,871 --> 01:45:47,326
You got three minutes, 59 seconds.

974
01:45:47,416 --> 01:45:52,243
- I saw the opportunity, and I got lucky.
- And?

975
01:45:52,337 --> 01:45:55,421
And I had my men ready,
as we got instructions where to go.

976
01:45:55,507 --> 01:45:59,884
You had your men ready to steal the drop,
ready to kill one ofthe kidnappers, yeah?

977
01:45:59,970 --> 01:46:00,965
You've done this many times.

978
01:46:01,388 --> 01:46:02,087
What's going on, guys?

979
01:46:04,516 --> 01:46:07,849
- One ofthe nephews ofthe head kidnapper.
- Bingo, bingo, yeah.

980
01:46:07,936 --> 01:46:09,928
You've done this many times.

981
01:46:10,021 --> 01:46:11,016
Many times, yes.

982
01:46:11,106 --> 01:46:14,438
Yeah. You've killed
many victims too, haven't you?

983
01:46:14,525 --> 01:46:18,688
- We just make out as best we can.
- "As best we could"?

984
01:46:20,406 --> 01:46:22,564
Two minutes, 47 seconds.

985
01:46:25,119 --> 01:46:27,325
Wait a minute.

986
01:46:27,412 --> 01:46:30,662
- Come on, I have a little gift for you.
- For me?

987
01:46:30,749 --> 01:46:34,034
- Yeah, come on.
- What have you got?

988
01:46:34,127 --> 01:46:37,910
There was no $10 million.
There was two and a half in the bags.

989
01:46:38,006 --> 01:46:41,920
The ransom was $10 million.
They put it in two bags, 5 million in each bag.

990
01:46:42,010 --> 01:46:46,339
Two bags, true, but one has half paper,

991
01:46:46,431 --> 01:46:48,886
the other only paper.

992
01:46:49,935 --> 01:46:52,176
Maybe your men stole it.

993
01:46:52,270 --> 01:46:56,481
No, no. Whoever did it
took it before the exchange.

994
01:46:58,484 --> 01:46:59,942
OK.

995
01:47:00,027 --> 01:47:03,609
At the Ramos house, before the exchange,

996
01:47:03,697 --> 01:47:06,614
who put the bags into the car?

997
01:47:06,700 --> 01:47:08,657
- Guess what.
- What?

998
01:47:08,744 --> 01:47:11,947
Ramos' lawyer. Jordan Kalfus.

999
01:47:29,514 --> 01:47:32,265
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry for the girl.

1000
01:47:32,351 --> 01:47:34,224
It was just business, you know?

1001
01:47:39,816 --> 01:47:42,436
Everybody keeps saying that to me.

1002
01:47:42,526 --> 01:47:47,104
I'm getting sick and tired of hearing it.
Do you understand me?

1003
01:47:49,909 --> 01:47:52,150
What are you going to do now?

1004
01:47:52,244 --> 01:47:54,320
What am I gonna do? Leave. I gotta go.

1005
01:47:54,413 --> 01:47:57,579
Go? Hey, come on, come on.
What about me?

1006
01:47:57,666 --> 01:48:00,121
What about you? You got 40 seconds.

1007
01:48:00,210 --> 01:48:01,752
- Come on.
- 35!

1008
01:48:01,837 --> 01:48:04,410
Give me a last wish, please, please.

1009
01:48:04,506 --> 01:48:07,376
Last wish? I wish...

1010
01:48:07,468 --> 01:48:10,504
you had more time.

1011
01:49:00,310 --> 01:49:03,844
JORDAN KALFUS RESIDENCE

1012
01:50:19,637 --> 01:50:20,917
?Hola?

1013
01:50:21,013 --> 01:50:23,764
- Mariana, it's me.
- Creasy, where are you?

1014
01:50:23,849 --> 01:50:27,846
I got something like banking codes
from Bankcoast in the Cayman lslands.

1015
01:50:27,937 --> 01:50:31,305
- I need it translated as fast as you can.
- Whose account is it?

1016
01:50:31,398 --> 01:50:32,975
Jordan Kalfus.

1017
01:50:33,067 --> 01:50:39,946
It looks like US deposits and withdrawals.
Give me the same thing on Samuel Ramos.

1018
01:50:40,031 --> 01:50:41,690
- That's it?
- That's it.

1019
01:50:42,867 --> 01:50:43,531
OK.

1020
01:51:09,935 --> 01:51:12,011
Poraqui, porfavor.

1021
01:51:29,370 --> 01:51:31,825
Creasy.

1022
01:51:31,914 --> 01:51:33,787
- Samuel.
- Honey?

1023
01:51:39,630 --> 01:51:41,955
What's goin' on?

1024
01:51:42,049 --> 01:51:44,207
That's what I wanna know.

1025
01:51:45,303 --> 01:51:46,678
What is goin' on?

1026
01:51:48,681 --> 01:51:50,757
Sam?

1027
01:51:52,059 --> 01:51:57,219
I'm gonna ask your wife
a couple of questions, OK? You move...

1028
01:51:57,314 --> 01:51:59,602
You make one sound...

1029
01:52:00,568 --> 01:52:05,644
and I'll snatch the life right out ofyou,
you understand?

1030
01:52:09,742 --> 01:52:11,900
What happened, Lisa?

1031
01:52:13,454 --> 01:52:17,783
Were you in on this,
or was itjust your husband?

1032
01:52:17,875 --> 01:52:19,832
- Am I in on what?
- You know what.

1033
01:52:19,919 --> 01:52:22,588
Pita's kidnapping, her death.
Were you a part of it?

1034
01:52:22,672 --> 01:52:26,040
- Pita got killed because the ransom...
- Shut up!

1035
01:52:27,301 --> 01:52:29,792
Yeah, the money was stolen, you're right.

1036
01:52:29,887 --> 01:52:35,557
The money was stolen by Victor Fuentes.
How much was stolen? $2.5 million, right?

1037
01:52:35,643 --> 01:52:38,679
- What are you talkin' about?
- He knows what I'm talkin' about.

1038
01:52:38,771 --> 01:52:41,475
- That's what Victor got.
- What are you talkin' about?

1039
01:52:41,566 --> 01:52:45,397
2.5 million.
2.5 million to your lawyer, Jordan Kalfus.

1040
01:52:45,486 --> 01:52:51,903
He put it in an account in the Cayman lslands,
but he won't get a chance to spend it.

1041
01:52:52,618 --> 01:52:54,905
What happened to the other five, Sam?

1042
01:52:54,994 --> 01:52:56,653
That's 2.5, 2.5.

1043
01:52:56,746 --> 01:52:59,949
What is five from ten? Five.
What happened to the other five?

1044
01:53:00,041 --> 01:53:01,867
Tell your wife. This is your chance.

1045
01:53:01,960 --> 01:53:03,952
- You got a wife, Creasy?
- No, I don't.

1046
01:53:04,045 --> 01:53:06,832
You'll never know how hard it is
to tell your wife the truth.

1047
01:53:06,923 --> 01:53:09,840
No, you have a wife!
You tell me what happened!

1048
01:53:09,926 --> 01:53:14,219
- It was in this room that my father...
- I don't give a fuck about your father!

1049
01:53:14,305 --> 01:53:18,219
He prayed for his gambling debts
and his infidelities to be forgiven.

1050
01:53:18,309 --> 01:53:19,684
- Samuel!
- What?

1051
01:53:19,769 --> 01:53:24,561
- I love you! Tell me the truth!
- I didn't inherit a kingdom! That's the truth!

1052
01:53:24,649 --> 01:53:27,934
You wanna know the truth?
I inherited his debt and his mess!

1053
01:53:28,027 --> 01:53:30,980
- Tell me what happened to my baby!
- I inherited his lawyer!

1054
01:53:31,072 --> 01:53:33,609
Say it! Say it! Say it!

1055
01:53:33,699 --> 01:53:36,368
Say it! Be a fuckin' man!

1056
01:53:39,954 --> 01:53:44,414
Jordan told me she'd sit in a room
and watch cartoons all day.

1057
01:53:44,501 --> 01:53:46,908
And she'd eat ice cream.

1058
01:53:47,003 --> 01:53:50,751
And we'd have her back in two days.
He lied to me!

1059
01:53:50,840 --> 01:53:53,757
That's why he's fucking dead. I did it!

1060
01:53:53,843 --> 01:53:55,919
I did it, Lisa!

1061
01:53:56,512 --> 01:53:58,718
I agreed to the kidnapping.

1062
01:53:58,806 --> 01:54:02,305
I did it for us. For the three of us.

1063
01:54:10,360 --> 01:54:12,436
I'm so sorry, Lisa.

1064
01:54:18,826 --> 01:54:20,902
You kill him.

1065
01:54:22,371 --> 01:54:24,161
You kill him, or I will.

1066
01:54:55,361 --> 01:54:57,567
You know how they say a...

1067
01:54:58,948 --> 01:55:02,032
bullet always tells the truth.

1068
01:55:11,001 --> 01:55:13,077
It never lies.

1069
01:55:25,849 --> 01:55:28,849
It didn't work for me, Samuel,

1070
01:55:28,935 --> 01:55:31,011
but maybe...

1071
01:55:34,190 --> 01:55:37,190
maybe it'll work for you.

1072
01:55:45,827 --> 01:55:47,285
I'll pray for you.

1073
01:57:23,879 --> 01:57:27,212
This is definitely the address
from the ATM card.

1074
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:32,334
The PIN number was a great locator.

1075
01:57:32,429 --> 01:57:37,090
But there's no one that sounds
anything like The Voice.

1076
01:57:39,102 --> 01:57:41,675
Who's that?

1077
01:57:42,522 --> 01:57:43,850
He's the man,

1078
01:57:43,940 --> 01:57:45,398
The Voice.

1079
01:57:46,026 --> 01:57:48,267
My guys got into the house...

1080
01:57:49,738 --> 01:57:52,525
on the pretext of giving cholera shots.

1081
01:57:55,243 --> 01:57:57,531
We had to inject the whole barrio.

1082
01:58:00,165 --> 01:58:04,376
We bugged the house
and stole the picture of him.

1083
01:58:12,885 --> 01:58:15,921
Now it's time to pursue him.

1084
01:58:16,972 --> 01:58:20,387
We have to put his photo in
tomorrow's newspaper.

1085
01:58:55,843 --> 01:58:58,843
Ifyou value your life,

1086
01:58:58,971 --> 01:59:02,137
you won't publish those photos.

1087
01:59:16,196 --> 01:59:17,773
- ?Hola?
- Hola.

1088
01:59:17,864 --> 01:59:20,781
- Mr Creasy?
- Yeah, it's me.

1089
01:59:20,867 --> 01:59:24,070
I traced the PIN for you and I have an address.

1090
01:59:24,162 --> 01:59:24,944
Yeah?

1091
01:59:25,038 --> 01:59:28,537
The cardholder is Reina Rosas Sanchez,
the wife of "The Voice".

1092
01:59:28,625 --> 01:59:32,918
She lives in Los Arcos,
apartment 26D, via Appia.

1093
01:59:33,004 --> 01:59:35,458
- Good.
- And another thing.

1094
01:59:35,548 --> 01:59:37,873
In today's paper is a picture of The Voice.

1095
01:59:37,967 --> 01:59:39,425
"FEAR HAS A VOICE."

1096
01:59:39,510 --> 01:59:41,134
Good. Thank you.

1097
02:00:55,167 --> 02:00:56,032
He's in.

1098
02:00:56,126 --> 02:00:57,833
What do we do?

1099
02:00:58,420 --> 02:00:59,534
Nothing... Nothing.

1100
02:01:50,052 --> 02:01:52,044
José, ?qué te pasa?

1101
02:01:52,972 --> 02:01:54,216
Alto, alto, alto...

1102
02:01:54,765 --> 02:01:56,175
Out of my house, you son of a bitch!

1103
02:01:56,267 --> 02:01:57,677
Stop there!

1104
02:02:46,148 --> 02:02:47,855
Get out. The kids out. Now!

1105
02:02:50,111 --> 02:02:53,147
!Salgan, ahora!

1106
02:02:57,159 --> 02:02:58,403
Sit down.

1107
02:03:01,539 --> 02:03:03,033
Sit down!

1108
02:03:05,376 --> 02:03:06,620
Reina Rosas, yes?

1109
02:03:08,295 --> 02:03:10,964
- Si.
- OK.

1110
02:03:15,260 --> 02:03:18,509
Who is this? Who is this?

1111
02:03:21,474 --> 02:03:23,098
?Quién es éste?

1112
02:03:30,483 --> 02:03:32,392
?Quién es éste?

1113
02:03:32,693 --> 02:03:33,190
Daniel.

1114
02:03:33,402 --> 02:03:34,315
Daniel what?

1115
02:03:34,862 --> 02:03:36,024
Daniel Rosas Sanchez.

1116
02:03:37,948 --> 02:03:40,652
The Voice?

1117
02:03:40,743 --> 02:03:43,447
- Si.
- OK.

1118
02:03:44,288 --> 02:03:45,995
And this is his brother?

1119
02:03:47,666 --> 02:03:49,575
- ?Si?
- Si.

1120
02:03:49,752 --> 02:03:50,700
What is his name?

1121
02:03:54,048 --> 02:03:55,079
What is his name?

1122
02:03:56,175 --> 02:03:56,791
Aurelio.

1123
02:03:56,884 --> 02:03:59,588
Aurelio Rosas Sanchez, OK.

1124
02:04:04,182 --> 02:04:06,304
OK.

1125
02:04:13,024 --> 02:04:15,811
And you are Daniel's woman, right?

1126
02:04:15,985 --> 02:04:17,776
- Si.
- ?Si?

1127
02:04:17,862 --> 02:04:19,142
How do you contact him?

1128
02:04:21,908 --> 02:04:23,900
How do you contact him?

1129
02:04:24,201 --> 02:04:26,359
We page him,

1130
02:04:29,874 --> 02:04:31,747
and he calls back on his cellphone.

1131
02:04:34,503 --> 02:04:36,080
Call him.

1132
02:04:47,807 --> 02:04:49,846
There's no signal in here.

1133
02:04:49,934 --> 02:04:52,341
We have to go on the roof.

1134
02:04:54,981 --> 02:04:56,012
Let's go outside.

1135
02:05:05,199 --> 02:05:07,025
Outside.

1136
02:05:18,045 --> 02:05:19,243
Momento.

1137
02:05:19,338 --> 02:05:20,500
They're going to get a call.

1138
02:05:21,924 --> 02:05:23,631
Be ready to track him.

1139
02:05:24,593 --> 02:05:28,211
Ifwe're lucky he'll lead us to The Voice.

1140
02:05:50,410 --> 02:05:51,608
Hola, Daniel.

1141
02:05:51,703 --> 02:05:55,154
- Señor Creasy.
- Yeah.

1142
02:05:55,248 --> 02:05:57,739
Yeah, I got your family here.

1143
02:05:57,834 --> 02:06:00,669
Your brother doesn't look too good.

1144
02:06:00,753 --> 02:06:04,833
Yeah, Reina, she's what,
about eight months? Yeah?

1145
02:06:05,758 --> 02:06:08,331
You wanna negotiate?

1146
02:06:10,763 --> 02:06:17,179
The most important thing in life is family.
Do you agree?

1147
02:06:18,895 --> 02:06:20,270
I agree.

1148
02:06:21,981 --> 02:06:24,554
There you are, you have my family.

1149
02:06:24,651 --> 02:06:27,521
Well, most of my family.

1150
02:06:28,154 --> 02:06:31,772
My wife and I are separated.
You know how that is.

1151
02:06:31,866 --> 02:06:35,649
Now, tell me seriously,
how much do you want?

1152
02:06:39,874 --> 02:06:43,373
Your brother wants to speak to you.
Here, hold on.

1153
02:06:48,674 --> 02:06:49,918
What the hell do you want?

1154
02:06:51,511 --> 02:06:53,550
Listen to me! Listen!

1155
02:06:53,638 --> 02:06:56,757
I'll take your family apart
piece by piece. You understand me?

1156
02:06:56,849 --> 02:06:58,971
Piece by piece! Shut up!

1157
02:07:00,144 --> 02:07:02,930
I don't want your money.

1158
02:07:03,021 --> 02:07:05,891
You understand me? You understand me?

1159
02:07:05,982 --> 02:07:08,555
I want you!

1160
02:07:41,267 --> 02:07:43,140
I'm listening.

1161
02:07:43,227 --> 02:07:46,844
I'm listening, Daniel. I'm listening.

1162
02:07:52,611 --> 02:07:56,276
All right. I will give you a life for a life.

1163
02:07:57,866 --> 02:08:00,403
Whose life? What are you talkin' about?

1164
02:08:00,493 --> 02:08:03,328
Whose life, Daniel? I want you!

1165
02:08:03,955 --> 02:08:06,955
I will give you her life. For your life.

1166
02:08:07,041 --> 02:08:11,453
And in exchange, I will get my life back.

1167
02:08:11,546 --> 02:08:16,670
- What life? Whose life?
- The girl's. Pita's.

1168
02:08:19,429 --> 02:08:22,382
- Pita's dead!
- Creasy!

1169
02:08:23,558 --> 02:08:27,970
I'm a businessman.
A girl dead is worth nothing.

1170
02:08:28,062 --> 02:08:29,093
She's alive.

1171
02:08:33,191 --> 02:08:35,267
All right.

1172
02:08:37,154 --> 02:08:42,528
I want proof of life, you hear me?
I want proof of life. I want...

1173
02:08:42,617 --> 02:08:45,985
I want the name of her bear.
What does she call her bear?

1174
02:08:46,079 --> 02:08:50,657
You tell her to tell you to tell me
what she calls her bear.

1175
02:09:01,761 --> 02:09:03,718
Little one...

1176
02:09:03,805 --> 02:09:06,093
What do you call your teddy bear?

1177
02:09:20,028 --> 02:09:21,687
Yeah?

1178
02:09:21,780 --> 02:09:25,398
Creasy. She calls the bear Creasy Bear.

1179
02:09:30,705 --> 02:09:32,033
Remember...

1180
02:09:32,123 --> 02:09:34,281
I will give you her life

1181
02:09:34,376 --> 02:09:36,368
for your life

1182
02:09:36,878 --> 02:09:39,250
and the life of my brother.

1183
02:09:41,675 --> 02:09:43,751
OK.

1184
02:09:45,470 --> 02:09:47,129
OK.

1185
02:09:48,181 --> 02:09:52,130
I give you your brother, you give me the girl.

1186
02:09:52,227 --> 02:09:55,062
- All right.
- Where?

1187
02:10:09,743 --> 02:10:14,120
He left the roof. We lost the signal.

1188
02:10:14,206 --> 02:10:15,748
We got cut off.

1189
02:10:17,667 --> 02:10:19,493
We lost him. We lost him.

1190
02:10:21,797 --> 02:10:22,745
Damn.

1191
02:10:39,898 --> 02:10:43,349
- Hello?
- Lisa, listen to me. Don't hang up.

1192
02:10:43,443 --> 02:10:45,518
I think Pita's alive.

1193
02:10:47,446 --> 02:10:49,734
I can't take this any more.

1194
02:10:49,823 --> 02:10:54,698
Take the road to Puebla.
Get offjunction 34, south side.

1195
02:10:54,786 --> 02:10:56,862
I'll meet you there in two hours.

1196
02:11:42,791 --> 02:11:45,116
So where is she?

1197
02:11:46,587 --> 02:11:50,964
She's right over there.
You see those two cars out there?

1198
02:11:56,263 --> 02:11:58,339
Pita's kidnapper, Daniel...

1199
02:11:59,558 --> 02:12:01,764
Here's his brother.

1200
02:12:03,645 --> 02:12:05,269
Here.

1201
02:12:06,314 --> 02:12:09,065
I'm goin' up on the bridge to get Pita.

1202
02:12:09,150 --> 02:12:13,443
Anything goes wrong, you put it to his head,

1203
02:12:13,530 --> 02:12:16,613
you pull the trigger, all right?

1204
02:12:16,699 --> 02:12:19,236
You understand?

1205
02:12:22,121 --> 02:12:26,747
You don't let him loose

1206
02:12:26,834 --> 02:12:29,621
until she's with you, you got it?

1207
02:12:32,548 --> 02:12:35,299
And you don't wait for me, OK?

1208
02:12:38,679 --> 02:12:41,845
- Yeah.
- You'll be all right. You OK?

1209
02:12:41,932 --> 02:12:43,426
Yeah.

1210
02:14:28,743 --> 02:14:30,486
Creasy!

1211
02:14:32,079 --> 02:14:34,155
Creasy!

1212
02:14:35,332 --> 02:14:37,869
Creasy!

1213
02:14:54,977 --> 02:14:56,519
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1214
02:14:56,603 --> 02:14:59,354
They didn't hurt you?

1215
02:15:00,858 --> 02:15:02,934
Hi.

1216
02:15:04,486 --> 02:15:08,815
All right, your mother's waiting for you.
She's at the end the bridge.

1217
02:15:08,907 --> 02:15:12,524
- OK, you go home.
- OK.

1218
02:15:12,618 --> 02:15:15,535
- All right.
- Where are you going?

1219
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,076
I'm goin' home too.

1220
02:15:23,087 --> 02:15:24,664
I'm goin' to Blue Bayou.

1221
02:15:31,887 --> 02:15:33,963
I got something for you.

1222
02:15:36,934 --> 02:15:39,092
I got the last number too.

1223
02:15:40,479 --> 02:15:42,021
I love you, Creasy.

1224
02:15:45,567 --> 02:15:47,892
And you love me, don't you?

1225
02:15:47,987 --> 02:15:50,359
Yes, I do.

1226
02:15:50,447 --> 02:15:52,605
Now, come on, Pita, go.

1227
02:15:53,659 --> 02:15:55,735
- Go. Run.
- Bye.

1228
02:16:09,215 --> 02:16:11,172
!Vamos!

1229
02:16:11,258 --> 02:16:12,586
Pita!

1230
02:16:12,677 --> 02:16:14,550
- Mom!
- Baby, come here! It's OK!

1231
02:16:14,637 --> 02:16:16,428
- Mom!
- Come on.

1232
02:16:16,514 --> 02:16:19,183
OK, I'll let you go now.

1233
02:16:19,266 --> 02:16:21,887
Mom!
