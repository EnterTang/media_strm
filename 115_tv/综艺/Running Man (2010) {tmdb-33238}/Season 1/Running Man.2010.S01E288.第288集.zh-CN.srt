
1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The beauty of a rainbow..

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
the complexity of photosynthesis..

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
the impact of UVrays.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
the mystique of an aurora-

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
these diverse cosmicphenomena..

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
all shed light on our relationship with the universe

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We are anything but passive bystanders...

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
in this whole pageant of phenomena thatwe see...

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
between Earth and space

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Life on Earth evolved in this environment...

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
of cosmic rays and aurorae and lightning..

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and all of the kinds of phenomena that we see...

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
is just part of the environment in which we've evolved.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And so it is part of us, and we are part of it.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The beautiful atmospheric phenomena that we see...

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
rainbows and auroras and meteors flying by..

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
as well as the potentially harmful things.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
like UVradiation from the Sun...

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
show us the Earth is notjust some isolated sphere...

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
detached from the rest of the universe.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
No, we're part of it...

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and thatmakes the Earth all the more beautiful.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and thatmakes the Earth all the more beautiful.
