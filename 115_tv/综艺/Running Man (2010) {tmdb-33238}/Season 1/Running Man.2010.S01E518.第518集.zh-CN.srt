1
00:00:03,374 --> 00:00:06,293
- 哈喽，雷蒙德？
- 比那好多了
- HeIIo, Raymond?
- Even better.

2
00:00:08,379 --> 00:00:10,297
我是罗伯特……
I'm Robert...

3
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:12,258
他弟兄
the brother.

4
00:00:12,258 --> 00:00:14,118
唔，嗨。
我是卡萝・马歇尔
WeII, hi.
I'm CaroI MarshaII

5
00:00:14,118 --> 00:00:15,953
哈姆国际真空清洁设备的
from Humm Vac CIeaning
Systems InternationaI.

6
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:18,622
- 请进
- 谢谢
- PIease, come in.
- Thank you.

7
00:00:18,664 --> 00:00:21,034
- 你一定是雷蒙德了
- 是的，嗨
- You must be Raymond.
- Yeah, hi.

8
00:00:21,075 --> 00:00:23,828
我昨晚喝你妻子谈好
过来演示操作我们的设备
I spoke to your wife Iast night about
coming by to demonstrate our system.

9
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,080
哦，是的。是的，吸尘器
Oh, right. Yeah, the vacuum.

10
00:00:26,122 --> 00:00:28,666
我以为她说我们
不需要新的吸尘器的
I thought she said we didn't need
a new vacuum cIeaner.

11
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,919
是的，她说了。我记得，
因为那是她说
Yeah, she did. I remember, because
it was right before she toId me

12
00:00:31,961 --> 00:00:34,297
我得上哪拿什么之前说的
I have to go pick up
something from somewhere.

13
00:00:34,338 --> 00:00:37,925
哦，你不明白我说的，是不是？
Oh. You didn't happen
to catch any of that, did you?

14
00:00:37,967 --> 00:00:39,886
对不起
Sorry.

15
00:00:39,927 --> 00:00:42,930
是的，不过我们昨晚谈的时候，
事情好像进展得很顺利
Yeah, so when we spoke Iast night,
things did seem pretty hectic.

16
00:00:42,972 --> 00:00:45,099
所以，因为我碰巧经过附近，
So, since I happened
to be in the neighborhood,

17
00:00:45,141 --> 00:00:46,642
我想也许现在可以
过来向你们
I wondered if now
might be a good time

18
00:00:46,684 --> 00:00:49,062
演示一下哈姆真空设备
是多么神奇，
to come show you how wonderfuI
the Humm Vac is

19
00:00:49,103 --> 00:00:51,355
并且送上这把赠品毛球刷
and to offer you
this compIimentary Iint brush.

20
00:00:51,397 --> 00:00:54,108
是吗，我不知道。
我妻子说我真的不能――
Yeah, I don't know. My wife says
I'm reaIIy not supposed--

21
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,652
行了，雷蒙德，
这是赠品（恭维）
Come on, Ray,
it's compIimentary.

22
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:00,406
可以吗，罗伯特？
May I, Robert?

23
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:02,408
不会疼的
This won't hurt a bit.

24
00:01:05,787 --> 00:01:07,705
欧呜。酷
Eww. CooI.

25
00:01:07,747 --> 00:01:09,248
归你了，感谢你的耐心
And that is yours
for being a good patient.

26
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:10,833
谢谢
Thank you.

27
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:13,336
你真温柔
You were very gentIe.

28
00:01:13,378 --> 00:01:15,588
哦这里，还有给你的
Oh here, I have one
for you too.

29
00:01:34,893 --> 00:01:37,104
干什么？
你吓死我了
What are you doing?
You scared the heII out of me.

30
00:01:37,146 --> 00:01:38,605
这是什么？
What is that?

31
00:01:38,647 --> 00:01:41,150
这是你保证会喜欢的东西
This is something
that you're gonna Iove.

32
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:43,152
哈姆真空吸
The Humm Vac Aspirate.

33
00:01:45,529 --> 00:01:47,614
- 什么？你买的？
- 是的
- What? You bought this?
- Yep.

34
00:01:47,656 --> 00:01:51,035
你听到我在电话上
跟那个女士说了
You heard me teII
the Iady on the phone

35
00:01:51,076 --> 00:01:53,746
咱们不需要吸尘器
that we do not need
a vacuum cIeaner.

36
00:01:53,787 --> 00:01:55,914
我知道，可结果证明咱们需要
I know, but it turns out
we reaIIy do.

37
00:01:55,956 --> 00:01:58,000
她给我看了一大堆土
She showed me aII the dirt.

38
00:02:00,461 --> 00:02:03,255
你让她进来了？
等等――等一等
You Iet her in here?
Wait-- wait a minute.

39
00:02:03,297 --> 00:02:05,257
这个推销员女士有多漂亮？
How good Iooking
was this saIesIady?

40
00:02:08,135 --> 00:02:10,637
你知道吗？
她非常漂亮
You know what?
She was quite good Iooking.

41
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,598
可我不怕说出来
But I'm not afraid to say that

42
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,558
因为这机器也一样好
'cause that's how good
this machine is.

43
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,644
就算换个丑男人我也买了！
I wouId've bought this
from an ugIy man!

44
00:02:17,686 --> 00:02:19,146
你整个一冤大头
You are such a sucker.

45
00:02:19,188 --> 00:02:22,149
我不能抗拒完美的产品！
A sucker for
a great product!

46
00:02:22,191 --> 00:02:24,276
听到这哈姆哈姆的声音了吗？
You hear that hum?

47
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,404
全封闭的四马力马达
That's a fuIIy-insuIated,
four horsepower motor.

48
00:02:27,446 --> 00:02:30,574
这个，夫人，是干净的声音！
That, madame,
is the sound of cIean!

49
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:33,410
“用途多用吗？”你问。
看看这个
''Is it versatiIe?'' you ask.
Check this out.

50
00:02:33,452 --> 00:02:36,246
这整块地方我只用了30秒
I did this whoIe
section in 30 seconds.

51
00:02:36,288 --> 00:02:38,040
扁吸头，卟！完事！
Crevice attachment,
boom! Done!

52
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,833
好吧，看，这很好
AII right, Iook,
that's very nice.

53
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,960
等等！看看这个
Wait a minute! Watch this.

54
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,506
你不会相信的
You're not gonna beIieve this.

55
00:02:45,547 --> 00:02:47,758
这些坐垫看起来够干净了……
These piIIows
seem cIean enough...

56
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,885
就肉眼看来！
to the naked eye!

57
00:02:51,387 --> 00:02:53,305
如果是普通吸尘器，
In a reguIar vacuum,

58
00:02:53,347 --> 00:02:55,557
吸力还比不上
there's not enough suction
power to pick up

59
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,935
鸡毛掸子
aII the dirt that
the beater bar kicks up.

60
00:02:57,976 --> 00:03:00,437
雷，关掉。
我昨天吸过了
Ray, turn it off.
I vacuumed there yesterday.

61
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,108
就算你昨天吸四五次，
用你的老吸尘器
You couId have vacuumed five times
yesterday with your oId vacuum.

62
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:06,193
雷，你想把我的坐垫怎么样？
Ray, what are you
doing to my piIIow?

63
00:03:06,235 --> 00:03:08,195
耐心点，亲爱的。
看着
Patience, my dear.
Look.

64
00:03:17,538 --> 00:03:20,708
哈姆真空的吸力高50倍
the Humm Vac has up
to 50 times more suction power.

65
00:03:21,917 --> 00:03:25,295
吸掉灰尘、死皮、
宠物毛，只要是你有的，
It puIIs up dust, dead skin,
pet dander, what have you,

66
00:03:25,337 --> 00:03:28,757
然后存到这个水罐里
deposits it aII into
this water reservoir.

67
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,759
- 不用袋子！
- 好吧，听着
- No bags!
- Okay, Iisten.

68
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:33,762
把她叫回来退了！
You're caIIing her back
and returning it!

69
00:03:37,641 --> 00:03:39,601
还是持怀疑态度，巴伦太太？
StiII skepticaI, Mrs. Barone?

70
00:03:41,437 --> 00:03:43,355
唔……
WeII...

71
00:03:43,397 --> 00:03:46,108
我不想吓你
I don't want to frighten you.

72
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,152
不过这里
But this

73
00:03:48,193 --> 00:03:51,196
是你的老吸尘器漏掉的东西
is what your oId vacuum
has been missing.

74
00:03:53,782 --> 00:03:56,994
喔
Wow.

75
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:59,747
这就是我们说的
“喔元素”
It's what we caII
''The Wow Factor.''

76
00:03:59,788 --> 00:04:01,957
他们把这也加进了设备的设计
They buiId it
right into the system.

77
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:04,668
这就是你家人呼吸的污浊物
This is the fiIth
that your famiIy's been breathing.

78
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,671
现在，你只要把它
倒进下水道
Now, you just dump it
right down the drain.

79
00:04:07,755 --> 00:04:09,798
这真的很惊人
That is pretty amazing.

80
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,968
是的。现在，让我教你怎么清理窗帘
Yeah. Now, I'II show you
how to do the drapes.

81
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,845
你要清理窗帘？
You're gonna do the drapes?!

82
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,681
不不，小傻瓜，是哈姆真空清理窗帘
No no, siIIy, the Humm Vac's
gonna do the drapes.

83
00:04:17,723 --> 00:04:19,641
我只负责接受表扬
I'm just gonna take the credit.

84
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:32,780
我这辈子从没对你
I have never been
more attracted to you

85
00:04:32,821 --> 00:04:34,823
这么着迷过
in my entire Iife.

86
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:43,248
想试试吗？
Wanna try?

87
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:47,503
- 好的
- 你的第一次
- Okay.
- Your first time.

88
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:51,382
我嫉妒你
I envy you.

89
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:03,185
哈喽，亲爱的！
HeIIo, dears!

90
00:05:03,185 --> 00:05:05,354
- 嗨，玛丽
- 嗨
- Hi, Marie.
- Hi.

91
00:05:05,396 --> 00:05:07,314
我从窗口经过，
I was passing by my window

92
00:05:07,356 --> 00:05:09,441
然后忍不住看了看屋子里
and I couIdn't heIp
seeing into your window.

93
00:05:10,859 --> 00:05:13,153
然后我注意到
你们买了新吸尘器
And I noticed,
you bought a new vacuum.

94
00:05:13,195 --> 00:05:16,031
这机器戏东西的能力太惊人了，玛丽。
而且不用袋子！
It's amazing what this thing
picks up, Marie. And no bags!

95
00:05:16,073 --> 00:05:18,742
不用袋子！
No bags!

96
00:05:18,784 --> 00:05:22,204
- 真高兴这事成了
- 什么意思？
- I am so gIad this worked out.
- What do you mean?

97
00:05:22,287 --> 00:05:24,331
那个推销女士打电话
告诉我
When the saIesIady
caIIed me and toId me

98
00:05:24,373 --> 00:05:27,084
她有自笤帚以来
最重大的清洁发明的时候，
she had the greatest cIeaning
innovation since the broom,

99
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:28,544
我立刻想到了你
I immediateIy
thought of you.

100
00:05:37,386 --> 00:05:39,555
- 你叫她来的？
- 当然了！
- You sent her over here?
- Of course!

101
00:05:44,893 --> 00:05:47,187
我可不知道
I did not know that.

102
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:49,148
唔，你们俩继续
WeII, you two enjoy.

103
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:51,608
我永远不想干涉家务活
I wouId never want
to interfere with housework.

104
00:05:56,739 --> 00:05:58,615
现在是跟你说说
Now might be a good time
to teII you about

105
00:05:58,615 --> 00:06:00,659
免费的桉树空气清新剂的时候了
the free eucaIyptus
room freshener.

106
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,961
把鞋子脱掉，我刚刚吸过那的！
Take your shoes off,
I just vacuumed up there!

107
00:06:18,133 --> 00:06:18,970
嗨，玛丽
Hi, Marie.

108
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:21,305
- 哈喽，亲爱的
- 我有没有打搅你？
- HeIIo, dear.
- Am I interrupting anything?

109
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,724
哦不。我只是把富兰克的裤子
再改大些
Oh no. I'm just Ietting
Frank's pants out again.

110
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,646
现在就看天意了
It's in God's hands now.

111
00:06:36,487 --> 00:06:38,990
你知道，玛丽，
You know, Marie,

112
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,992
我心里有点事，
something was bothering me

113
00:06:40,992 --> 00:06:42,994
我只想问问你
and I just wanted
to ask you about it.

114
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:45,830
当然了，亲爱的。
什么事？
Of course, dear.
What is it?

115
00:06:47,498 --> 00:06:49,250
唔，
WeII,

116
00:06:49,292 --> 00:06:51,085
你知道今天下午，
you know this afternoon,

117
00:06:51,127 --> 00:06:53,045
你说那个女推销员
when you said
that the saIesIady

118
00:06:53,087 --> 00:06:55,923
告诉你她有多么好的
新清洁工具的时候……
toId you that she had this
great new cIeaning device...

119
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:59,594
你立刻想到了我
you immediateIy
thought of me.

120
00:06:59,635 --> 00:07:02,054
为什么？
Why was that?

121
00:07:07,143 --> 00:07:09,145
不，真的，玛丽。为什么？
No, reaIIy, Marie. Why?

122
00:07:09,187 --> 00:07:11,731
这是耍人的问题吗？
Is this a trick question?

123
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:16,777
不。只是你好像总是暗示
No. It just seems Iike
you're aIways impIying

124
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:18,738
我没把家保持干净
that I don't keep a cIean house.

125
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:20,698
唔，现在你有帮手了
WeII, now you have a IittIe heIp.

126
00:07:22,658 --> 00:07:26,037
可是你不觉得你
不需要买个哈姆真空
But you didn't feeI
the need to buy a Humm Vac.

127
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,498
唔，那机器是给那些……
WeII, that machine
is for peopIe--

128
00:07:29,457 --> 00:07:31,417
就像是……
it's Iike...

129
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:34,045
如果你腿出毛病了，
你就会需要拐杖
if you have a bad Ieg,
then you need crutches.

130
00:07:40,468 --> 00:07:42,428
而你的腿很好？
And your Iegs are fine?

131
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,684
那么说这屋子里没灰了？
So there's no dirt
in this house?

132
00:07:48,726 --> 00:07:50,895
我在当然没有了
Not since I've Iived here.

133
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:53,272
- 真的吗？
- 嗯嗯
- ReaIIy?
- Mm-hmm.

134
00:07:53,314 --> 00:07:55,274
- 谢谢
- 好的
- Thank you.
- Okay.

135
00:08:10,414 --> 00:08:13,084
哦！你把你的新吸尘器拿来了
Oh! You brought
your new vacuum here.

136
00:08:13,084 --> 00:08:15,378
需要我教你怎么用吗？
Do you need me
to show you how to use it?

137
00:08:17,171 --> 00:08:20,591
不，我知道怎么用。
我只想让你知道点事
No, I know how to use it.
I just want to show you something.

138
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,593
你要吸我的屋子？
You're going
to vacuum my house?

139
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,428
你知道，我家也许看起来
You know, my house
might appear

140
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,222
是比你的乱了点
to be a bit more
cIuttered than yours.

141
00:08:26,264 --> 00:08:29,141
不过好吧，偶尔有些碎渣子、
And aII right, there's
the occasionaI crumb,

142
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,227
脏盘子。我不是说没有脏东西
dirty dish. I'm not
saying there's no dirt.

143
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:33,521
是的，是有，不过每个房子里都一样
Yeah, there is,
but that's every house.

144
00:08:33,563 --> 00:08:36,983
每所房子都有灰尘，
玛丽，即便是这里
Every house has dirt,
Marie, even this one.

145
00:08:39,944 --> 00:08:43,239
唔，我得说，
我想你――
WeII, I must say,
I think you're going--

146
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:45,199
让让，玛丽！
Excuse me, Marie!

147
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:47,159
这就是所谓的
This is what we caII

148
00:08:47,201 --> 00:08:49,328
货物集散地
a high-traffic area.

149
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:52,832
逆着地毯绒了
You're going against the nap.

150
00:08:52,874 --> 00:08:54,834
从没有人告诉过你绒纹吗？
Did anyone ever
teach you about nap?

151
00:08:59,797 --> 00:09:02,341
好吧
Okay.

152
00:09:02,383 --> 00:09:04,302
咱们来看看
Let's take a Iook

153
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:07,221
我们乐意称为的
at what we Iike to refer to as

154
00:09:07,263 --> 00:09:09,557
“喔元素”
''The Wow Factor.''

155
00:09:10,725 --> 00:09:12,685
这水看起来很干净
That water
Iooks very cIean.

156
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,273
喔
Wow.

157
00:09:23,988 --> 00:09:25,948
唔，让――让我――
让我再――
WeII, I-Iet-- Iet me just--

158
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,328
让我试试沙发地下，好吗？
Iet me try under
the couch, okay?

159
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:32,288
好了
There we go.

160
00:09:34,749 --> 00:09:37,627
这底下肯定脏得厉害
It can get pretty
nasty under here.

161
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:46,052
好了
Okay.

162
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,683
该死
Damn it.

163
00:09:57,647 --> 00:10:00,942
是我眼花了还是
这水看起来真得更干净了？
Is it me, or does that
water Iook even cIeaner?

164
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,362
唔，
WeII,

165
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,697
我才刚学用这个，所以……
I'm stiII kinda getting
the hang of this, so...

166
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,699
你得明白，亲爱的，
You have to
understand, dear,

167
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:10,660
吸尘器不能打扫屋子，
that vacuums
don't cIean houses.

168
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,246
人才是打扫屋子的
PeopIe cIean houses.

169
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,916
你知道，也许我没把这个
You know, maybe
I just didn't have this

170
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,876
完全伸进去，就是这样
pushed aII the way in,
that's it.

171
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:21,003
唔，欢迎继续
WeII, you're weIcome
to keep going.

172
00:10:21,045 --> 00:10:23,506
也许是个好的练习机会
It's probabIy good practice.

173
00:10:23,548 --> 00:10:26,968
我的裤子呢，玛丽？
我要冻死了！
Where are my pants, Marie?
I'm freezing here!

174
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:29,637
哦，来了，弗兰克！
Oh, coming, Frank!

175
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,597
你都弄了一头大汗了
You've worked up
quite a sweat.

176
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:34,517
等我回来
给你拿点凉的喝
When I come back, I'II bring
you something cooI to drink.

177
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,651
- 嘿，你做什么呢？
- 把你鞋给我
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Give me your shoes.

178
00:10:43,693 --> 00:10:45,152
什么？
你干什么？
What?
What are you doing?

179
00:10:45,194 --> 00:10:47,947
你和孩子们今天去沙池了，是不是？
You and the kids were in the sandbox
this morning, weren't you?

180
00:10:47,989 --> 00:10:50,700
是的，怎么了？哦，不，
帕克的猫也去了？
Yeah, what? Oh, no,
did Parker's cat get in there?

181
00:10:50,741 --> 00:10:53,536
快点！
我需要灰尘！
Come on!
I need some dirt!

182
00:10:53,578 --> 00:10:56,205
我要让你妈永远闭上嘴！
I'm gonna shut
your mother up once and for aII!

183
00:10:56,247 --> 00:10:58,416
你要用土堵上她的嘴？
Are you gonna fiII
her mouth with dirt?

184
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:00,543
不！用地毯
No! On the rug.

185
00:11:00,585 --> 00:11:03,212
她会看到她像所有其他人
一样需要这个吸尘器
She's gonna see she needs
this vacuum Iike anybody eIse.

186
00:11:03,254 --> 00:11:05,214
拜托，先解开鞋带！
Come on, untie it first!

187
00:11:06,674 --> 00:11:08,926
哦，快点！
把另一只拿来
Oh, come on!
Give me the other one.

188
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,928
哦不
Oh no.

189
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,598
该死，偏偏今天你不做猪了！
Damn it, the one day
that you're not a pig!

190
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:18,019
我想你气出毛病来了
I think you're
getting a IittIe nuts here.

191
00:11:19,604 --> 00:11:21,522
塑料。是塑料的！
It's pIastic.
It's pIastic!

192
00:11:22,523 --> 00:11:24,317
连她的土都不是土！
Even her dirt's not dirt!

193
00:11:24,358 --> 00:11:26,903
你知道这是什么吗？
这就是个白痴狗屁吸尘器！
You know what it is?
It's this stupid vacuum cIeaner!

194
00:11:26,944 --> 00:11:28,988
我叫你不要买的！
I toId you not to buy it!

195
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,073
不不不不。
不！不！停下！
No no no no.
No! No! Stop it!

196
00:11:31,115 --> 00:11:32,742
嘿！
Hey!

197
00:11:32,783 --> 00:11:34,702
嚷嚷什么呢？
What's with aII the yeIIing?

198
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,372
我不认为能黛比拉找得到土
I don't think Debra
couId find any dirt.

199
00:11:38,414 --> 00:11:41,417
好了，好吧，这里没土，你赢了！
Okay, aII right, there's
no dirt here, you win!

200
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:43,711
我只是受不了你
让我觉得自己是个糟糕的人，
But I am sick of you making
me feeI Iike a bad person

201
00:11:43,753 --> 00:11:46,172
就因为我没照你那样
照看我的房子！
because I don't keep my house
exactIy the way you do!

202
00:11:46,214 --> 00:11:49,717
干净的房子并不是
世界上最重要的东西
A cIean house is not the most
important thing in the worId.

203
00:11:49,717 --> 00:11:52,512
你知道谁会这么说？
没有条理的人
You know who says that?
A messy person.

204
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:58,017
好吧。你也许无法相信，玛丽，
AII right. As hard as this
is for you to beIieve, Marie,

205
00:11:58,059 --> 00:11:59,852
我的确想保持一个整洁的房子
I do Iike to keep a neat house.

206
00:11:59,894 --> 00:12:02,605
我只是不会把每一点空余时间
都用来打扫它！
I'm just not going to spend
every spare minute cIeaning it!

207
00:12:02,647 --> 00:12:06,067
没有空余时间。
你有一家人要照顾
There are no spare minutes.
You have a famiIy to care for.

208
00:12:06,108 --> 00:12:08,611
是的，我要！
我关心我的家人
Yes, I do!
I care for my famiIy.

209
00:12:08,653 --> 00:12:11,697
我花时间爱他们，
而不是给他们消毒
I spend my time enjoying them,
not steriIizing them.

210
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,995
- 你是说我不爱我的家人了？
- 不，那不是――
- You're saying I don't Iove my famiIy?
- No, that's not--

211
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,790
因为世上没有比家人更让我爱的了
Because there's nothing in the worId
I Iove more than my famiIy.

212
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,544
放松！
Easy!

213
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,925
不，只是这房子太干净太……
No, it's just that this
house is so cIean and so...

214
00:12:30,925 --> 00:12:32,885
有条理了
arranged.

215
00:12:32,927 --> 00:12:35,221
这可不是世上最温馨的地方
It's not exactIy
the warmest pIace in the worId.

216
00:12:35,263 --> 00:12:37,974
- 你怎么能这么说？
- 唔，我是说，拜托
- How couId you say that?
- WeII, I mean, come on.

217
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,393
塑料沙发套
PIastic sIipcovers.

218
00:12:40,434 --> 00:12:42,436
这是为了保护沙发面
That's to protect
the uphoIstery.

219
00:12:42,478 --> 00:12:45,189
是保护了沙发面，
可你想过别人的感受是什么吗？
So it protects the uphoIstery, but
how do you think it makes peopIe feeI?

220
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,191
又热又粘乎
Hot and sticky.

221
00:12:48,651 --> 00:12:51,445
特别是夏天
家人聚集的时候
EspeciaIIy in the summer
when I'm in my aII-together.

222
00:12:54,532 --> 00:12:57,910
我说，感谢上帝赐予沙发套
I say, thank the Lord
for the sIipcovers.

223
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,370
哦，得了吧，雷！
Oh, come on, Ray!

224
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:01,914
你老是拿沙发套编笑话
You make jokes about those
sIipcovers aII the time.

225
00:13:01,956 --> 00:13:03,708
你笑我的沙发套？
You joke
about my sIipcovers?

226
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,710
没可能。不，这不是我的作风
No way.
No, that's not my styIe.

227
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:07,879
你刚刚是怎么说
塑料、
What did you just say
about the pIastic

228
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,673
化妆间还有客人用的毛巾的？
and the powder room
and the guest toweIs?

229
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,802
跟我说说，雷蒙德
TeII me, Raymond.

230
00:13:18,514 --> 00:13:20,975
就是，你知道，就好像，
Just, you know, it's Iike,

231
00:13:21,017 --> 00:13:23,436
那些咱们从没用过的瓷器
there's the china
that we never use

232
00:13:23,477 --> 00:13:26,230
和从没碰过的客人用毛巾
and there's toweIs
that we never touch.

233
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,065
就好像你把所有东西都留着
It's Iike you're
saving everything

234
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:31,152
等一个从没出现过的时刻
for a speciaI occasion
that hasn't happened yet.

235
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,210
他说得没错
He's right.

236
00:13:35,252 --> 00:13:38,213
那些带金边的小毛巾是
干什么的？
What are those IittIe toweIs
with the goId fringe for?

237
00:13:38,255 --> 00:13:41,717
等教皇过来用咱们楼下的马桶？
For when the Pope comes over
here to use the downstairs can?

238
00:13:42,926 --> 00:13:45,304
- 安静
- 我要用了它们
- Be quiet.
- I'm using 'em.

239
00:13:45,345 --> 00:13:48,140
不，你不能。
你高兴了，雷蒙德？
No, you're not!
Are you happy now, Raymond?

240
00:13:48,181 --> 00:13:49,691
行了，妈，不是什么大不了的
Come on, Ma,
it's not a big deaI.

241
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:51,231
我来告诉你，雷蒙德
Let me teII you
something, Raymond.

242
00:13:51,273 --> 00:13:54,384
你们俩兄弟小时候，
成天在土里头打滚
When you boys were IittIe, you were
aIways outside in the dirt.

243
00:13:54,426 --> 00:13:56,970
然后把这当公交车站一样
到处乱踩
Then you'd tromp through
here Iike it was a bus station.

244
00:13:57,011 --> 00:13:59,222
然后罗伯特长的一双大脚，
And Robert with his gigantic feet,

245
00:13:59,264 --> 00:14:01,349
就像屋里养了匹马
it was Iike having
a horse in the house.

246
00:14:01,391 --> 00:14:04,436
不，这可不是笑话
No, it was not funny.

247
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:07,856
不，我只有这样
才能保护这个地方
No, it was aII I couId do
to take care of this pIace.

248
00:14:07,897 --> 00:14:10,567
- 嗨
- 把鞋子脱了！
- Hi.
- Take off your shoes!

249
00:14:10,608 --> 00:14:13,611
- 哈？
- 脱下来！这不是马房
- Huh?
- Take them off! You're not in a barn.

250
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:18,908
照她说的做，
我们给你胡萝卜吃
Do what she says,
we'II give you a carrot.

251
00:14:21,578 --> 00:14:23,496
怎么了？
What's going on?

252
00:14:23,538 --> 00:14:25,749
看到了，玛丽？
这就是我说的
You see, Marie?
This is what I'm taIking about.

253
00:14:25,749 --> 00:14:27,834
你眼里只关心房子干净，
You're so obsessed
with the house being cIean,

254
00:14:27,876 --> 00:14:29,878
看看你对你儿子做了什么
Iook what you're doing
to your son.

255
00:14:32,714 --> 00:14:35,592
好吧。好吧
AII right. Fine fine.

256
00:14:35,633 --> 00:14:38,511
把鞋子穿回去，
想怎么奔就怎么奔
Put your shoes back on and gaIIop
around here aII you want.

257
00:14:38,553 --> 00:14:41,181
- 什么？
- 穿回去
- What?
- Put them back on.

258
00:14:42,557 --> 00:14:44,934
是的，同时检查一下
你的脚什么时候过期
Yeah, and check the expiration
date on your feet.

259
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:52,817
- 你做什么？

- What are you doing?

260
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:54,778
我可以改变

261
00:14:54,819 --> 00:14:58,406

- I'm taking the covers off.
- Where are we gonna sit?

262
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:02,619
你们可以就坐在沙发上
You can sit right here
on the couch

263
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,871
因为我不在乎这些事了
'cause I don't care about
these things anymore.

264
00:15:04,913 --> 00:15:07,082
我可不是不能变通的人
I'm nothing
if I'm not fIexibIe.

265
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,710
你什么意思，玛丽？
What are you saying,
Marie?

266
00:15:10,752 --> 00:15:13,505
我们可以坐沙发上？
We can sit on the couch?

267
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:16,383
请便，弗兰克。
请吧

268
00:15:22,931 --> 00:15:26,184
那么，我们可以坐那？
So, we can

269
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:28,686
在真正的沙发上？

270
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:30,855
坐吧，好好享受

271
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,192
- 你先
- 呃呃
- You first.
- Huh-uh.

272
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:37,153
坐下行不行？
这是个沙发！
WouId you sit?

- It's very nice.

276
00:16:19,362 --> 00:16:21,322
我觉得淘气
I feeI
a IittIe naughty.

277
00:16:27,537 --> 00:16:29,456
等不及到夏天了

谢谢你，黛比拉

00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,528
真舒服
This is nice.

285
00:18:08,847 --> 00:18:10,724
你做什么？！
What are you doing?!

286
00:18:10,765 --> 00:18:12,559
看你做了什么！
你高兴了？
Look what you did!
Are you happy now?

287
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,979
她让我紧张。
臭着眼瞪我！
She was making me nervous.
Giving me the skunk eye!

288
00:18:17,147 --> 00:18:19,149
我们要把套子遮上！

我的家人是第一位的

293
00:18:29,034 --> 00:18:31,077
你们也许会想
You might want to take
those cushions outside

294
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:32,662
先把垫子拿出去抖抖
