

451
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,440
我觉得没那个必要吧
I'm not sure that was necessary.  

452
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:20,910
我也觉得是
Neither am I.

453
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,420
不是罗拉因为发现哈维尔跟塔莎鬼混而起了杀心
It wasn't Lola who caught Javier and Tasha fooling around.

454
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,350
是塔莎的男朋友妒火中烧
It was Tasha's jealous boyfriend.

455
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,390
妒火中烧的男朋友  哈
A jealous boyfriend, huh?

456
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,140
虽然阿蒂竭力想要撇清
Artie may have been trying

457
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,400
他自己的关系
to deflect attention away from himself,

458
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,030
但这条线索确实值得跟
but it's a lead worth following up.

459
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,360
就是他 塔莎的前男友
There he is. Tasha's ex.

460
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,650
有着耀眼的水晶般双眸
The one with the gleaming crystal eyes

461
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,590
嘴唇就像刚吃完桃子意犹未尽
and the mouth that looks like it just finished eating a peach.

462
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:46,150
你直接告诉我他穿着什么颜色的衣服就成了
How about you just tell me what color shirt he's wearing?

463
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,390
蔚蓝色
Cerulean.

464
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,530
周二6点到7点那段时间
What were you doing on Tuesday

465
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,370
你在做什么
between the hours of 6:00 and 7:00?

466
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,170
我在家  一个人
I was at home. Alone.

467
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,950
怎么可能呢
How did that happen?

468
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,240
里维拉先生  你有多高
How tall are you, Mr. Rivera?

469
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,730
6尺3英寸（大约190cm）
I'm 6'3.

470
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,090
你第一次听到
When did you first learn about...

471
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,620
我能问个问题吗
Can I just ask a question?

472
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,040
你是否有着印第安血统
Do you have a little Native American in your ancestry

473
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,470
因为你的颧骨
'cause those cheekbones...

474
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,780
摩尔小姐
Miss Moore!

475
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,900
哦 对不起
Oh. Sorry.

476
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,730
我有四分之一彻罗基族血统
I'm a quarter Cherokee.

477
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,400
你看 我就说是嘛
Yeah, you are.

478
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,450
我是不是有必要让你出去啊
Do I need to ask you to leave?

479
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,040
你是什么时候知道你女朋友跟哈维尔在一起的
When did you first learn about your girlfriend and Javier?

480
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,490
是前女友
Ex-girlfriend.

481
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:28,800
我不记得了
And I don't remember.

482
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,450
你不记得什么时候发现你女朋友出轨了
You don't remember discovering your girlfriend cheating on you?

483
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,290
我不想钻牛角尖
I don't like to dwell on things.

484
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,730
再说了 她也得到报应了
Besides, she got what was coming to her.

485
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:39,250
哈维尔几个月前为了一个更年轻的小妞把她给甩了
Javier dumped her a few months ago for a younger version.

486
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,700
她就是为了那样的人离开我的
That's the kind of guy she left me for.

487
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:44,820
他睡了自己最好朋友的18岁的女儿
Someone who'll bang his best friend's 18-year-old daughter.

488
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,120
阿蒂
Artie?

489
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,830
他经纪人的女儿
His manager's daughter?

490
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,670
对 贝卡
Yeah. Becca.

491
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:52,450
在贵圈是保不住这样的秘密的
It's a not-too-well-kept secret around the art community.

492
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,080
但你可别说是从我这儿听到的
But you didn't hear it from me.

493
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,460
我得请你喝一杯
You gotta let me buy you a drink.

494
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,200
我今天得活的有意义一些
I need something in the win column today.

495
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,030
我觉得你得把标准定得高一点
I think you need to set the bar a little bit higher.

496
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:22,950
请人喝杯酒
Buying somebody a drink

497
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,430
可不算是什么成就
doesn't seem like much of an accomplishment.

498
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,940
那得看我之前你拒绝了多少人了
That depends on how many guys you turned down before I got here.

499
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,710
所以
So...

500
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,350
你怎么会一个人
What brings you here to drink alone

501
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:39,670
在这样美好的夜晚喝着闷酒
and stare off into the top-shelf liquor on this fine evening?

502
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:43,460
可以理解成 生活无处不惊喜啊
Let's just say life takes some surprising turns.

503
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,920
可不是吗
Doesn't it, though?

504
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,490
如果一年前有人告诉我
If someone were to tell me a year ago

505
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,340
我今天的生活会是什么样子
that my life would be like it is today,

506
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,200
我肯定一记响拳就上去了
I would've punched him in the face.

507
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,680
听着
Listen,

508
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,600
你挺有魅力
you're incredibly charming,

509
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:03,050
但是我不怎么喜欢姐弟恋
but the age difference isn't something I'm into.

510
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,920
哎呀  那真是可惜了
Well, that is a shame.

511
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,370
虽然我寂寞得很
Because I am lonely as hell and the idea of trying

512
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,300
但是想到让我跟一个25岁的酒吧女郎搭讪的话
to have a conversation with some 25-year-old

513
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,100
还不如
as she swipes through Tinder,

514
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,910
让我一头撞死在吧台上
makes me want to impale myself on that bar tap.

515
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,510
还好我们还能愉快的聊天
Well, there's no reason why we can't have a nice chat.

516
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,100
当然了
Sure there is.

517
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,830
进来吧
Come on in.

518
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:06,580
嘿 不管谁在这个叫丽芙的女人身体里面
Hey, pod person who's taken over Liv's body,

519
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,980
你好歹做点家务吧
you really should've done some homework

520
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,750
因为没人会买你的画的
because no one is going to buy this.

521
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,770
对不起  我刚才有点入神了
Sorry. I was kind of in the zone or something.

522
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,810
嗨
Hi.

523
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,070
嗨
Hi.

524
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,920
如果你在家造火箭
I would literally be less surprised to come in here

525
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,280
恐怕我都没觉得有这个稀奇
and find you building a rocket ship.

526
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,680
这是新爱好
It's a new hobby.

527
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,880
不敢相信这可是一个认为爱好是仅限
This coming from the girl who said

528
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,830
12岁以下 65岁以上人士的女人说的
hobbies were for people under 12 or over 65.

529
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,060
我什么时候说那样的话了
When did I say that?

530
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,040
都说了好几年了
Repeatedly. Over the course of several years.

531
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,600
但我一直认为你那么说只是为了
But I think you were just trying to talk me out of

532
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,320
让我别捣鼓我做户外家具的事
making my own outdoor furniture,

533
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,340
但至今我还是觉得那是个好点子
which I still think I'd be kind of awesome at.

534
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,420
等等  你这听的是查特・贝克吗
And, I'm sorry, are you listening to Chet Baker?

535
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,440
原来他叫这名字啊  我喜欢他的歌
Is that who this is? I am loving him.

536
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,550
你怎么着
You're what?

537
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,960
我试着让你接受爵士乐都好几年了
I tried to get you to listen to jazz for years.

538
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,490
我曾经花费几个礼拜时间给你做混音CD
I spent weeks strategically arranging the perfect mix CD for you

539
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:50,920
然后你听两首就受不了了
and you stopped listening after two songs.

540
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,260
这张CD好像就是你给我的
I think this is the CD.

541
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,720
你说你觉得无结构的音乐是孤芳自赏
You said you thought the lack of structure was narcissistic

542
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,650
你宁愿挺锅碗瓢盆都不愿听这个
and you'd rather listen to someone dropping cutlery.

543
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,300
我过去怎么那么混蛋
Why was I such a jerk?

544
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,790
谁知道
Who knows?

545
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,420
我忍你的事情可不止这一件
It was just one of the many things I accepted

546
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,230
谁叫你那么火辣呢
because you're super-hot.

547
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:04,500
开玩笑的
I'm kidding,

548
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,700
有点开玩笑啦
to a degree.

549
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,540
如果你真的喜欢这张CD的话
If you're really liking this CD,

550
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,230
我还有一堆好听的可以给你再录
I have a bunch of stuff on vinyl I could record for you.
