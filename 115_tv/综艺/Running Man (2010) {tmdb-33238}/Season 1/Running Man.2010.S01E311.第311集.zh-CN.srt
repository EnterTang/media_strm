1
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,726
- Yes?
- Room service.

2
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:09,996
We've got to stop meeting like this.

3
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:13,536
You've been waiting
your whole life to say that.

4
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:19,139
I have to be some place
in three hours.

5
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:24,075
Why is your skin so soft?

6
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,514
When Dickens wrote, "It was the best

7
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:29,154
"of times, it was the worst of times",

8
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:31,347
he must have been having an affair

9
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:33,355
with his married ex-boyfriend.

10
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,295
Yeah?

11
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:43,628
It's me.

12
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:48,901
You can't keep changing the time.
I have a schedule too.

13
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:50,633
Fine. I'm sorry.

14
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,371
- Let's get those panties off.
- I have to put my diaphragm in.

15
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:56,515
I have to be at work in 40 minutes.

16
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:58,207
I know.

17
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:02,009
Our affair like our hotels
had gone from elegant with crystal

18
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:05,021
to seedy with plastic cups.

19
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:08,985
Cracker?

20
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:20,030
God, it's hot in here,
and the windows don't even open.

21
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:24,666
I hate those sliding air strip things.

22
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,003
I need air.

23
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,114
You picked the hotel.

24
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:33,649
Because it's on 56th and 8th,
where nobody knows us.

25
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,017
- 56th and 8th is safe.
- I don't give a fuck who sees us.

26
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:40,522
Yes, you do. I do, too.
You want people to get hurt?

27
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:44,158
This room smells like take-out curry.

28
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,370
It's too hot, I can't do this.

29
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:01,172
Are you saving it for your boyfriend?

30
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:03,474
Carrie.

31
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,245
No. You don't talk to me that way.

32
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,918
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,859
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,656
Jesus.

35
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,799
How did we get here?

36
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,797
Who are we?

37
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,418
- There you go.
- Thanks.

38
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,591
I have to tell you something.

39
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:49,854
You won't like it. I'd rather tell anyone
but you, but I have to.

40
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,429
OK.

41
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,499
- Because I need your help.
- OK.

42
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:57,329
I'm having an affair with Big.

43
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,835
I think my heart just stopped.

44
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:04,204
Also, I'm smoking again.
I'm smoking and sleeping with Big.

45
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,402
Feel free to delete me
out of your Palm Pilot.

46
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,139
- Give me one.
- Really?

47
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:13,615
- I think I need it.
- You are such a good friend.

48
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,344
Don't inhale.

49
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,623
Say you don't hate me.

50
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:26,526
- I don't.
- Thank you. If only I didn't hate me.

51
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:29,224
- How long has it been going on?
- Forever.

52
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,597
Actual time - three weeks.

53
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,968
I'm in the middle of this,
and I can't see.

54
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:39,043
I need you to yank me out of it.
Say stuff to yank me out of it.

55
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:43,581
- What about Aidan?
- Exactly. What about Aidan?

56
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,083
What about him?
I would die if he found out.

57
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:51,952
Big's acting jealous. I'm afraid
he'll call him or do something stupid.

58
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,390
- He's threatened to tell Natasha.
- What did you think would happen?

59
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:59,895
I didn't think. I just did.
I'm terrified we've messed it up

60
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,227
and it can never be
what it was supposed to be.

61
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:07,305
- It's a big mess.
- Take it easy, OK?

62
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:11,840
I'm confused. Does he only want me
because he can't have me?

63
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,104
- Yes.
- How do you really feel?

64
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,147
Forget about him.
What do you want?

65
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,343
I want everyone
to get out of this without getting hurt.

66
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,648
- That's realistic.
- Why not?

67
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:27,919
You've heard stories about affairs
where people realise

68
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,925
how great their other relationship is

69
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:32,324
and end it without
anyone being the wiser.

70
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,864
I don't watch
"Lifetime Television For Women".

71
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:40,038
You have to just stop. OK?
Just stop.

72
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,538
I am. I'm stopping.

73
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:45,576
- I am.
- Good.

74
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:47,973
- Who else knows about this?
- Samantha.

75
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,172
- And God.
- Not Charlotte?

76
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,013
If the-world-according-to-bride knew,
she'd kill me.

77
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,816
At least you wouldn't
have to be a bridesmaid.

78
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,619
While Miranda was trying not
to judge me on the Upper East Side,

79
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:06,197
Samantha was judging the crowd
at a hot spot on the Lower West Side.

80
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:11,895
It was a typical mix - ten per cent
Wall Street, ten per cent real estate,

81
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,836
ten per cent she'd slept with.

82
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,368
His name was Tom Reymi.

83
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,910
Excuse me.

84
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:27,576
A Manhattan legend - straight, single,
and sexually very active.

85
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:29,516
The male Samantha.

86
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:33,351
- Hi. I'm Tom Reymi.
- I know who you are. I'm...

87
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,893
- I know who you are.
- It's about time we met.

88
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:40,328
We know the same people,
we should go to dinner, blah blah.

89
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,559
- Wanna fuck?
- Under a minute.

90
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:47,297
- You could qualify for the Olympics.
- My place is...

91
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:55,439
- Do you swing?
- Swing?

92
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:58,641
You mean with other couples?

93
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,443
No.

94
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,117
Swing.

95
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:08,056
Oh my, so Cirque du Soleil.

96
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:10,320
You haven't fucked
till you've fucked in the swing.

97
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:14,795
I've always wanted to run off
and join the circus.

98
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:18,465
So, Samantha...

99
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:21,129
when was your last AIDS test?

100
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:24,070
So much for foreplay.

101
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:28,407
Anyone who has as much sex as us
has to ask, right?

102
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:31,209
I was tested again three weeks ago.

103
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,648
I'm good to go. How about you?

104
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,653
Samantha didn't know
how to tell Tom Reymi

105
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,553
that the only sex test she'd ever
taken was the Cosmo Quiz.

106
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:42,592
You have been tested, right?

107
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:45,526
No, but I'm very healthy.

108
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:49,465
- You haven't been tested. Why?
- I'm a busy girl.

109
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:53,766
I got hard in that club
just from looking at you.

110
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:59,037
We both know what's gonna happen
when we get in that swing.

111
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:04,013
I can't fuck you or eat you how I want,
unless I know it's safe.

112
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:09,484
Samantha, you should do me.

113
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,680
I am as good as they say.

114
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:17,854
Samantha had to figure out just
how much she wanted to do Reymi.

115
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,994
The pink Post-its
are for the gowns I like.

116
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,797
Green is for the gowns I really like.

117
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,269
Yellow is for the gowns
I don't know if I like.

118
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:33,208
Kill me, please.
Drag a sharp object across my throat.

119
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:37,907
Stop. You take "Modern Bride".
Samantha, "New York Bride".

120
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:41,986
- And I'll take "Annoying Bride"?
- Page 211. Tell me what you think.

121
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:45,055
- Okey-dokey.
- Cute purse.

122
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:48,751
There's no time for purses.
This is gown specific.

123
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:52,261
- Is your theme a Nazi wedding?
- Page 211.

124
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:57,198
- It's pretty. I like the flowers.
- Me, too. And I like that satin bow.

125
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:59,566
Have you all had an AIDS test?

126
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,532
Good morning.
Where did that come from?

127
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:08,646
I met this very hot guy. He won't
sleep with me unless I have a test.

128
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:14,081
We're looking at wedding gowns.
Could you not talk about AIDS now?

129
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:17,814
- You've never had an HIV test?
- No. Have you?

130
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,687
- Two.
- Three.

131
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:27,094
- How about upper length gloves?
- How can you not have had a test?

132
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,667
She doesn't mean that
the way it sounds. It's just...

133
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:32,269
Why not?

134
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:36,431
I always practise safe sex.

135
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,668
All right, I'm terrified.

136
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:42,439
- What if I have it?
- You don't have it.

137
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,083
Sometimes it takes me
a long time to get over a cold.

138
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,186
That's air conditioning.
Just get it over with.

139
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:51,846
The test is nothing. The worst part
is waiting for the results.

140
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:57,929
They take some people to this room,
and you know the news ain't good.

141
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,863
I sat there praying,
"Please don't take me in that room".

142
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:05,162
There are 1400 gowns
in this magazine.

143
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:08,330
I have only seen 600 of them.
I need help.

144
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:12,375
- You need to chill out. Hire a stylist.
- A stylist?

145
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:15,105
Some mignon
to do your dress bidding.

146
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,373
I can hire someone to do that?

147
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,883
This is New York.
You can hire someone to do anything.

148
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:24,716
- I'll fax you some names.
- Thank you, thank you.

149
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,916
If only I could hire someone
to take that test.

150
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:32,096
Later, I got thinking about safe sex.

151
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:37,827
Odd how only when our physical life
is at risk, do we protect ourselves.

152
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,632
What about our emotional lives?

153
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,331
Wouldn't it be nice
if there was a pamphlet to warn us

154
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:47,912
what behaviour might be high risk
to ourselves or our relationships?

155
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,881
Even if you take precautions and
emotionally try to protect yourself,

156
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:57,455
when you crawl in bed with someone,
is sex ever safe?

157
00:10:57,623 --> 00:11:00,524
Yeah, I know,
but that's not my problem.

158
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:06,391
The next day, Miranda experienced
a different type of high risk behaviour.

159
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:09,693
- Eat me.
- Excuse me?

160
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:11,267
Eat me.

161
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:19,510
Miranda was furious. It was
bad enough she had just lost a case,

162
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:22,738
but now she was being harassed
by a sandwich.

163
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:28,350
You want pasta, you go to Little Italy.
You want wedding, you go Wang.

164
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:32,513
You want the perfect wedding dress,
go to Anthony Marantino, stylist.

165
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,717
Where is that sales girl?

166
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:39,160
For these prices, we should be
pulling her nose out of our asses.

167
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:41,595
Hello, someone. Let's go.

168
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:47,296
Charlotte was thrilled. Anthony was
like the pushy mother she never had.

169
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:50,738
Go, go, go...

170
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,311
I love them all.

171
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,946
Duchess satin with the lace appliqué.

172
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:09,725
- The white is too white.
- No, with your skin tone...

173
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,557
Hates it. Move on.

174
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:18,136
The sharmoose, strapless,
with the net overlay.

175
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,966
Hates it.

176
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,269
Good bead work, though.

177
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:28,913
None of these are right at all.

178
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,583
- You're dragging!
- I hope she doesn't think I'm a bitch.

179
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,349
She's not paid to think,
but to make you happy.

180
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:42,688
I've been imagining my wedding dress
ever since I was a little girl.

181
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,989
I want it to be perfect.

182
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,827
Not for nothing.
I've done this a million times.

183
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,629
Don't worry. You'll know
the right dress when you see it.

184
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,105
Anthony.

185
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:58,442
Char.

186
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:00,936
That's it.

187
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:07,819
Across town, Samantha felt
as though she might cry as well.

188
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,649
- Have you had an HIV test before?
- No.

189
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,122
Why are you taking this test?

190
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,456
I... feel...

191
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,459
You know, it's...

192
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:23,500
- Are you feeling all right?
- Sorry, I'm really nervous.

193
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:27,331
Relax. Just routine questions.
Nothing to be alarmed about.

194
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:30,700
OK. Thanks.

195
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,903
- Do you have sex?
- Yes.

196
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:39,676
- Oral sex - give, receive?
- Yes. Yes, yes.

197
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:43,754
- Do you have anal sex?
- Yes.

198
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:46,915
- Do you swallow?
- Only when surprised.

199
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,822
- Do you use condoms?
- Yes.

200
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:56,434
- What kind of condoms?
- Lifestyles, Chic, Wet & Wild...

201
00:13:56,602 --> 00:14:01,471
- No, I meant, latex, lambskin?
- Yes. Yes.

202
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,336
How many sexual partners
have you had?

203
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,715
I'm counting.

204
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:19,950
This year?

205
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,559
While Samantha
tried to remember her sexual past,

206
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:27,222
I came face to face
with my sexual present.

207
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:32,365
- Stop.
- Stop what?

208
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:36,167
You're making that sound. That...

209
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:39,937
...kissing sound. It's annoying.

210
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:44,280
It's just a sound I make, I guess.

211
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:49,314
Come here.
I'll try not to do it anymore.

212
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,321
Look, Ma, no sound.

213
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:10,401
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

214
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:17,244
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

215
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,686
Don't go.

216
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:29,316
I don't get it.
You used to like that sound I make.

217
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,690
I love that sound.

218
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:40,133
- Where are you going?
- Home. I need time.

219
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:46,471
I'm in a weird place right now,
but I'll be out of it soon. I promise.

220
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,309
I'm sorry.

221
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,446
Say it's OK.

222
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,988
It's OK.

223
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:05,586
- What can I do?
- Nothing, it's me. It's all me.

224
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:10,497
- I just need time to figure it out.
- I'll give you room to do that.

225
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:14,036
You're not saying that
in a bad way, right?

226
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:17,274
No.

227
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,035
I'll be right downtown.

228
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:27,477
Hey, buddy. Call me later?

229
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:31,487
It's 1:00 in the morning.
I'll call you tomorrow.

230
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:35,118
Make the noise.
Please make the noise.

231
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,406
Good night.

232
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:53,306
Sorry.

233
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:56,171
I didn't know what I was doing,

234
00:16:56,348 --> 00:17:02,617
but I was sure I had just entered
high-risk relationship behaviour.

235
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,016
Eat me.

236
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,523
Three days later, Miranda had
got her fill of the sandwich.

237
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,595
That's it. You're not allowed
to harass women like that.

238
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,288
Eat me.

239
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,524
We'll see about that.

240
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:23,738
- I'd like to speak to the manager.
- That's me.

241
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:29,608
That sandwich says sexually explicit
things to women as they walk by.

242
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,715
- What did he say?
- "Eat me."

243
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,081
- Yeah, he's a sandwich.
- He didn't say it in the sandwich way.

244
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,688
He said it
in the sexual harassing way.

245
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,915
He's a sandwich.

246
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:48,958
- Eat me.
- You're brave inside your sandwich.

247
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:55,298
Then Miranda glimpsed just enough
of his full lips and shiny white teeth

248
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:58,136
to stop thinking about the sandwich

249
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,871
and start wondering
about the man inside.

250
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,106
I can't stop thinking about him.

251
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,410
You're turned on by a sandwich?

252
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:12,023
It's the fact that I can't see him.
It's dangerous or something.

253
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:15,991
- That is one fresh sandwich.
- His voice is so sexy.

254
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:17,992
He's probably a troll.

255
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:23,123
Any man who propositions a woman
from a sandwich must be a troll.

256
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:27,534
I don't know.
You think he's white meat?

257
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:33,743
That's the first laugh
I've had in weeks.

258
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:36,107
Thank the sandwich
when you have sex.

259
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:41,446
I can't have sex with a sandwich.
Can I?

260
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,111
I never thought I'd have sex
with a married ex.

261
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,883
Can a hoagy be that far behind?

262
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:51,086
Miranda, what the hell am I gonna do?

263
00:18:56,068 --> 00:19:01,267
As Samantha waited for her results,
she had one thought over and over.

264
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,000
"Don't let them take me
into that little room."

265
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:08,670
Ms Jones, I've got your results.
Please come with me.

266
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,679
Samantha began to realise she was
being taken into that little room.

267
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,487
She was healthy.
The nurse just wanted a quiet place

268
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,633
to lecture her on safe sex practises.

269
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:34,796
Days later, somehow I found myself
back at the corner of 56th and Safeth.

270
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:41,035
- How much?
- Excuse me?

271
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:44,046
I've seen you here before.

272
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,845
For sex - how much?

273
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:53,456
I'm out of here. That Japanese
businessman thinks I'm a hooker.

274
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:54,922
Wait. Carrie!

275
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:05,737
Carrie? What are you
doing in this neighbourhood?

276
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:08,668
Carrie, can we...

277
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:14,167
Hey.

278
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:20,311
I was doing business in the area.
We bumped into each other.

279
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:21,543
How are you?

280
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:25,484
I just checked on my wedding dress,
it's at the tailor and...

281
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,524
- Charlotte.
- I'd better go.

282
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,093
Charlotte.

283
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:35,695
That was that.
Now nowhere was safe.

284
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:38,597
Not even 56th and 8th.

285
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:45,566
It was a force bigger than me,
like Niagara Falls, you know?

286
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,905
No, I don't know. He's married.

287
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:52,675
- I know he's married.
- You're the other woman.

288
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:57,049
I'm not the other woman.
I'm not. I mean...

289
00:20:57,222 --> 00:21:01,056
I know I am,
but I am not that woman.

290
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:03,751
Please, I feel bad enough already.

291
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:08,127
Good. Do you ever think about
how she'd feel if she found out?

292
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,497
- I think about it all the time.
- No, you don't.

293
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,901
You think about what would
happen to you, not about her.

294
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:18,270
She's just the idiot wife.
You don't know anything about her.

295
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:23,005
- I'll suffocate myself in this.
- This isn't a joke.

296
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:25,580
They took vows. Vows he broke.

297
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:31,018
I'm getting married. How would
you feel if someone did this to me?

298
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:33,487
I would kill them.

299
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:40,197
How could you do this?
You're my maid of honour.

300
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:46,095
I'm getting out.
Can I please help you pack now?

301
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:48,466
So we stood and bubble-wrapped,

302
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:52,543
the bride to be
and her maid of dishonour.

303
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:59,945
A week of fantasising sex with the
sandwich man had gotten to Miranda.

304
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:03,281
Safe or not, she needed to see
who she was dealing with.

305
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:06,390
Hi. Look, this is so silly.

306
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:07,547
Eat me.

307
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,585
Let me see your face.

308
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:21,302
Even though he was cute,
Miranda walked away.

309
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:23,498
What did they have in common?

310
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:27,008
She was a lawyer.
He was a sandwich.

311
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,380
Later, at Tom Reymi's,
after a week of sheer anxiety,

312
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:37,920
Samantha enjoyed
the benefits of totally safe sex.

313
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:52,029
Take your time. There's stuff
in the kitchen if you're hungry...

314
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:55,935
It was the lowest of the low. I had
made love to my married ex-boyfriend

315
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,235
on his lunch hour at his apartment,

316
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,971
while his 25-year-old wife
was sunning herself at the Hamptons.

317
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:05,082
- Jesus.
- What?

318
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:10,243
Could I feel any more like a hooker?

319
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:17,659
Why do you keep
doing that to yourself?

320
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:20,195
We should stop seeing each other.

321
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,291
Why?

322
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,673
You're married.

323
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:33,800
Hand me the phone.
I'm gonna call her right now.

324
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:36,812
Don't be ridiculous.
What are you gonna do -

325
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:41,417
call her at the beach and say
you love me and want a divorce?

326
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,953
You don't want me to call her
because you love that other guy.

327
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:48,422
- This is about that other guy.
- He has a name. It's Aidan.

328
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,357
- You have a wife, Natasha.
- Give me the phone.

329
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,964
You could have told her by now.

330
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:56,930
You told me not to tell her.

331
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:02,332
Here. Call her.

332
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:08,442
If I make that call,
are you gonna be there for me?

333
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:11,639
Are we gonna do this, really?

334
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:18,052
I mean, out in the daylight,
no cocktails, no hotel rooms, real life?

335
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,953
Carrie, in or out?

336
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:26,788
I need more time.

337
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:33,199
I'm calling her Monday.

338
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:36,806
I have to go.
You know how to let yourself out.

339
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:43,078
I couldn't help but wonder if I really
did know the way to let myself out.

340
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:52,083
Charlotte was right. What did I
really know about Natasha?

341
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:56,624
Natasha is a woman
who likes tea roses.

342
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,268
Natasha collects antique sugar bowls.

343
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:06,631
Honey?

344
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,932
Natasha comes home
from the Hamptons early.

345
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:14,067
Honey, are you here?
I took the Jitney home.

346
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:18,439
Sweetheart?

347
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,452
Honey?

348
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:29,316
Carrie. I see you.

349
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:33,931
Wait! I knew you were
having an affair, but not in my house.

350
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,294
Stop, I'm talking to you.

351
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:47,467
Oh my God!

352
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:51,207
I had assumed, the one
who would be hurt would be me.

353
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,851
Taxi!

354
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:02,282
Nearest hospital.

355
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:04,553
Shit!

356
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:31,549
Is she all right?

357
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:34,851
She lost a tooth
and needed a stitch in her lip.

358
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:41,056
They had a plastic surgeon, and it
won't scar. She's scared and swollen.

359
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:44,531
Her parents are on the way.
I have to go.

360
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:49,997
Thanks for being here.

361
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:54,306
I'll call you.

362
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,009
For what?

363
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:02,047
We're so over.

364
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,121
We need a new word for "over".

365
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,290
Carrie.

366
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,543
Surprise.
Where have you been all day?

367
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:39,052
I went to a museum.
Just walking around.

368
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:43,785
- Oh, yeah? How was it?
- It was good.

369
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:47,227
- I'll just wash my face. I'll be right in.
- OK.

370
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:01,642
Somehow, I had found a way
to let myself out of the mess.

371
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:05,647
I'd made it home.
