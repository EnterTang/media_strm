l had to go through
1 5 Draculas

360
00:18:11,654 --> 00:18:14,088
才找到拿着"东西"的小孩

然后我跟他买糖果
And then l bought
it off him.

362
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,217
他不知道他手上拿着什么?
Did he know what he had?

363
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,285
不 为了不引起怀疑
No, but l didn't want
to get him suspicious,

364
00:18:20,329 --> 00:18:22,297
所以我还向他买了爆米花

368
00:18:31,073 --> 00:18:33,871
就不是我们一家发"东西"了
then we're not the only ones
giving out the things.

369
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:38,107
