1
00:00:00,584 --> 00:00:02,002
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:04,630
I was in a wheelchair
paralyzed for four years.

3
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:07,466
This island-- It changed me.
It made me whole.

4
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:09,843
I'm so thankful for you, John.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,637
You stole my kidney.

6
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:14,014
You needed a father,
and I needed a kidney,

7
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,767
And that's what happened.
Get over it.

8
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,352
I don't care what Jack said.

9
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,908
They've got him, and we have to
get him back. I owe him that.

10
00:00:20,936 --> 00:00:23,610
- How did you get onto this island?
- They brought me on the submarine.

11
00:00:23,642 --> 00:00:26,818
So your people-- They can just
come and go whenever they want?

12
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:29,444
You never know when a little
C4 might come in handy.

13
00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:32,823
Jack--

14
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:41,451
Name?

15
00:00:42,707 --> 00:00:43,910
John Locke.

16
00:00:44,927 --> 00:00:46,422
Marital status, Mr. Locke?

17
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:48,793
Uh, single.

18
00:00:49,138 --> 00:00:50,172
Girlfriend?

19
00:00:50,715 --> 00:00:51,261
No.

20
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:55,681
Are your parents living?

21
00:00:57,397 --> 00:01:00,850
Uh, I was raised in foster care.
I never really knew my parents.

22
00:01:02,608 --> 00:01:05,270
Have you ever considered seeking
out your biological parents?

23
00:01:07,105 --> 00:01:10,152
Uh, uh...
I don't see how that's relevant.

24
00:01:10,277 --> 00:01:14,903
It's relevant, Mr. Locke, because if the
government's gonna continue paying your
disability insurance,

25
00:01:15,035 --> 00:01:18,412
I have to figure out whether or
not your condition has improved.

26
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:23,622
So... how's your appetite?

27
00:01:25,046 --> 00:01:26,462
Fine.

28
00:01:27,835 --> 00:01:31,251
I see you stopped submitting your
therapy bills for reimbursement.

29
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,673
It's 'cause I stopped going.

30
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:36,132
Waste of time.

31
00:01:40,856 --> 00:01:43,351
It's just a temporary suspension,
Mr. Locke.

32
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:46,603
As soon as you resume your sessions,
you can reapply.

33
00:01:46,646 --> 00:01:49,060
You think I'm
temporarily disabled?

34
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:50,982
Depression can be
temporary, yes.

35
00:01:51,155 --> 00:01:53,823
And since you see fit to
stop going to therapy,

36
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:55,363
I guess you're all better.

37
00:01:58,998 --> 00:02:00,281
Guess I am.

38
00:02:03,417 --> 00:02:04,201
Next!

39
00:02:23,815 --> 00:02:24,810
What is he doing?

40
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:30,063
Good hands!

41
00:02:33,658 --> 00:02:34,532
Jack!

42
00:02:40,915 --> 00:02:43,373
She's the one who helped
me and Sawyer escape.

43
00:02:44,707 --> 00:02:47,253
- What's up?
- I think it's gonna be a while...

44
00:02:56,307 --> 00:02:58,263
- Hey, what?
- Danielle.

45
00:03:01,475 --> 00:03:03,433
John, Rousseau's gone.

46
00:03:47,857 --> 00:03:50,021
This is gonna be more
complicated than we thought.

48
00:04:08,628 --> 00:04:10,160
So what exactly
are you saying--

49
00:04:10,378 --> 00:04:12,302
We simply start shooting
people and hope for the best?

50
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:14,432
We came here to rescue Jack,
and that's what we're gonna do.

51
00:04:14,465 --> 00:04:17,431
But obviously the circumstances have
changed. He may not want to be rescued.

52
00:04:17,468 --> 00:04:19,050
That is not him.
That's not Jack.

53
00:04:19,216 --> 00:04:20,640
They must have done
something to him.

54
00:04:20,676 --> 00:04:22,670
When they captured us,
they drugged us.

55
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:24,200
He didn't appear to
be drugged, Kate.

56
00:04:24,268 --> 00:04:26,983
They kidnapped him, held him prisoner.
He wouldn't just forget that.

57
00:04:27,018 --> 00:04:29,932
I agree, but until we know why,
we're putting our lives at risk.

58
00:04:29,975 --> 00:04:32,680
- I'm not leaving him, Sayid.
- We may not have a choice.

59
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:33,943
It's Jack.

60
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,733
The first time I saw him,
he was risking his life

61
00:04:37,865 --> 00:04:40,571
pulling people out of
burning airplane wreckage.

62
00:04:41,076 --> 00:04:43,830
If he's shaking hands with the Others,
I'm sure he has a good reason.

63
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,662
We just have to go down there
and find out what it is.

64
00:04:51,336 --> 00:04:52,580
What do you suggest?

65
00:04:52,706 --> 00:04:55,290
We wait till it's dark.
We approach Jack when he's alone...

66
00:04:57,716 --> 00:04:59,840
And if he wants out,
we get him out.

67
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:03,263
Here's what we know, Crystal.

68
00:05:03,516 --> 00:05:07,640
The bolivian coal deposits were
stolen last night around 2:00 A.M.

69
00:05:07,806 --> 00:05:11,180
Oh, that means the Cobra--
He's back.

70
00:05:13,816 --> 00:05:16,103
Has he been shot?
I can't find him!

71
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:20,613
He's armed! I can't get up!

72
00:05:23,995 --> 00:05:25,653
Hello. John locke?

73
00:05:26,496 --> 00:05:28,283
I'm sorry. No solicitors.

74
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,120
I have a sign.

75
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:32,410
Oh, I'm not--
I'm not trying to sell you...

76
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:34,540
Listen, my name's Peter Talbot.

77
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,831
I-I just need a couple
minutes to talk to you.

78
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:40,291
- Talk about what?
- My mother, actually.

79
00:05:40,845 --> 00:05:42,631
I think she might
be in some trouble.

80
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:44,260
You got the wrong John Locke.

81
00:05:44,465 --> 00:05:46,091
How many kidneys do you have?

82
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:55,020
She met him two months ago.
"Love at first sight," is what she said.

83
00:05:55,186 --> 00:05:57,810
The guy was charming,
sweet, funny.

84
00:05:58,696 --> 00:06:00,192
His name's Adam Seward.

85
00:06:00,368 --> 00:06:02,983
He's a retired computer
entrepreneur from Ontario.

86
00:06:05,946 --> 00:06:09,413
Anyway, Adam had
something... special.

87
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:11,420
My mom just went gaga for
him right out of the gate.

88
00:06:11,457 --> 00:06:15,580
After two months of knowing him,
she agrees to marry the guy.

89
00:06:15,705 --> 00:06:17,293
And something about him, it...

90
00:06:18,505 --> 00:06:21,823
Something in my gut told me that he was
after something, so I had to check
him out.

91
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,470
Well, i'm not sure I know what
any of this has to do with me.

92
00:06:27,558 --> 00:06:30,432
Well, what this has to do with you,
Mr. Locke,

93
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,220
is that you donated one of
your kidneys to Adam Seward,

94
00:06:34,815 --> 00:06:40,230
Only his name was different back then.
He used to be "Anthony Cooper."

95
00:06:46,248 --> 00:06:48,613
All I could find were
his medical records,

96
00:06:49,788 --> 00:06:53,031
and I saw that he was the recipient
of a kidney transplant from...

97
00:06:53,285 --> 00:06:54,411
you.

98
00:06:55,626 --> 00:07:00,333
So I figured, hey, someone gave the
guy his kidney. How bad could he be?

99
00:07:01,425 --> 00:07:02,333
Right?

100
00:07:08,726 --> 00:07:13,183
Well, it-- It was an anonymous donation.
I never met him.

101
00:07:19,026 --> 00:07:20,353
Are you sure?

102
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,443
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I can't help you.

103
00:08:07,155 --> 00:08:10,572
Sayid, you guard the front.
I'll go around and cover the back.

104
00:08:10,695 --> 00:08:12,970
- You head in through the side door.
- I'm going in alone?

105
00:08:13,078 --> 00:08:14,832
It's better if you're
the first one he sees.

106
00:08:15,326 --> 00:08:15,782
All right.

107
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:38,821
Hi.

108
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:44,543
- What are you doing here?
- I came to get you.

109
00:09:44,968 --> 00:09:47,292
Get out of here right now. Go.

110
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,671
Jack-- Kate,
they're watching me!

111
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,601
- Get out of here!
- I'm not leaving you.

112
00:09:52,847 --> 00:09:54,163
Yes, you are!
Get down! Get down!

113
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:55,883
Don't hurt her! Don't hurt her!

114
00:09:55,926 --> 00:09:58,180
Step back, doc. Step back.

115
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:03,392
- Jack!
- Hold him still.

116
00:10:03,605 --> 00:10:05,103
Jack! Jack!

117
00:10:06,146 --> 00:10:07,811
Who else is with you?

118
00:10:12,447 --> 00:10:16,611
- Jack?
- Just answer the question, Kate.

119
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,412
Okay, one more time--

120
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,580
Who else is with you?

121
00:10:27,086 --> 00:10:28,080
Nobody.

122
00:10:29,005 --> 00:10:31,133
Nobody else. It was just us.

123
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:57,400
Alex?

124
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:05,451
John!

125
00:11:05,585 --> 00:11:09,672
- Shh. Keep your voice down.
- All right.

126
00:11:11,927 --> 00:11:14,963
It's all right, John.
You don't have to point the gun at me.

127
00:11:15,095 --> 00:11:16,710
I can tell you where Jack is.

128
00:11:17,807 --> 00:11:24,301
I'm not looking for Jack.
I'm looking for the submarine.

129
00:11:28,186 --> 00:11:31,401
The submarine-- Where is it?

130
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:34,690
I'm not sure what you mean, John.
What submarine?

131
00:11:34,905 --> 00:11:38,361
The one you use to travel
to and from the island...

132
00:11:38,658 --> 00:11:40,740
The one your man
Mikhail told me about

133
00:11:41,247 --> 00:11:42,991
Right before I killed him.

134
00:11:44,128 --> 00:11:47,042
- Dad? Who are you talking to?
- Alex, don't come in here!

135
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:55,291
- Tell her to be quiet.
- Alex, please.

136
00:11:55,546 --> 00:11:56,960
Ben, you awake?

137
00:11:57,468 --> 00:11:58,423
No!

138
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:04,601
I'm coming in.

139
00:12:07,315 --> 00:12:10,433
- What is it?
- It's Austen and Jarrah.

140
00:12:10,608 --> 00:12:13,102
They're here.
Somehow they found us.

141
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,113
Where are they now?

142
00:12:15,315 --> 00:12:17,651
We captured them.
We're holding 'em over at my place.

143
00:12:17,735 --> 00:12:19,190
Want me to help
you get outta the--

144
00:12:19,232 --> 00:12:21,658
No. Separate them.
I want to know how they found us.

145
00:12:21,651 --> 00:12:23,534
What about Juliet and
Shepard? Tomorrow--

146
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:25,453
Let me worry about that.
Just go.

147
00:12:25,669 --> 00:12:26,493
Got it.

148
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,541
Richard, wait a minute.

149
00:12:28,837 --> 00:12:30,581
I'll wait outside.

150
00:12:35,585 --> 00:12:38,961
I want you to bring me
the man from Tallahassee.

151
00:12:39,848 --> 00:12:43,300
- What do you need him for?
- Just do it. Now.

152
00:12:43,478 --> 00:12:44,131
Okay.

153
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,600
"The man from Tallahassee"?
What is that...

154
00:12:55,945 --> 00:12:57,062
Some kind of code?

155
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,363
No, John, unfortunately,
we don't have a code for

156
00:12:59,575 --> 00:13:02,693
"There's a man in my closet with
a gun to my daughter's head,"

157
00:13:02,827 --> 00:13:05,453
Although we obviously should.

158
00:13:05,615 --> 00:13:11,623
Sayid-- He had a pack with him.
I want her to retrieve it.

159
00:13:13,465 --> 00:13:15,041
Okay.

160
00:13:15,126 --> 00:13:17,840
But you should know, John,
my daughter currently hates me,

161
00:13:17,885 --> 00:13:20,883
so i'm not sure holding me
hostage is your best option--

162
00:13:20,928 --> 00:13:21,802
Dad.

163
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,683
I'll get your bag.

164
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:45,741
Honey? What do you
think of this one?

165
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:48,201
Oh, it looks good.
What do you think?

166
00:13:48,418 --> 00:13:50,990
I like it.
Maybe just a little larger.

167
00:13:52,296 --> 00:13:53,752
Yeah...

168
00:13:55,587 --> 00:13:58,581
Larger would be good.

169
00:13:59,007 --> 00:14:00,712
Um, i'll go over
there and take a look.

170
00:14:07,475 --> 00:14:08,593
Hello, John.

171
00:14:09,146 --> 00:14:10,551
Gonna be a big to-do

172
00:14:10,857 --> 00:14:13,472
or just the two of
you and a preacher?

173
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:16,313
I guess you couldn't invite me, huh?
That would make for...

174
00:14:16,695 --> 00:14:18,521
awkward introductions.

175
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,910
- How did you even know that i was gonna--
- I know because her son came to me

176
00:14:20,946 --> 00:14:24,610
And asked why I
gave you a kidney.

177
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:27,201
He's on to you,
but he doesn't have any proof.

178
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:31,582
So he came to me hoping
I would vouch for you.

179
00:14:31,668 --> 00:14:33,290
What did you say to him?

180
00:14:35,836 --> 00:14:38,171
You're conning her, aren't you?

181
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,673
You're gonna marry her
for her money, right?

182
00:14:42,388 --> 00:14:44,170
What is it you want, John?

183
00:14:44,387 --> 00:14:46,010
I want you to end it.

184
00:14:46,425 --> 00:14:48,683
I want you to call
off the wedding.

185
00:14:49,727 --> 00:14:53,761
- Why are you doing this?
- Because-- Because it's not fair.

186
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,351
You make people think
that you're their family,

187
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,522
and then you leave
their life in ruins,

188
00:14:59,697 --> 00:15:02,982
and i'm not gonna
let you do it again.

189
00:15:03,365 --> 00:15:06,320
You're gonna call off
your engagement and go,

190
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,450
or I'm gonna tell
her the truth.

191
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:13,833
I want to hear you say it.

192
00:15:14,128 --> 00:15:15,620
You say you're gonna leave.

193
00:15:22,757 --> 00:15:26,593
Okay, John. You got it.

194
00:15:41,697 --> 00:15:44,361
Would you mind helping
me get into my chair?

195
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,651
No tricks, I promise.

196
00:15:50,578 --> 00:15:53,662
I just want some dignity.

197
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:59,540
You of all people should understand
what it means to want some dignity.

198
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:08,263
Thank you.

199
00:16:12,765 --> 00:16:14,433
So tell me, John,

200
00:16:14,645 --> 00:16:16,683
how do you expect to
pilot our submarine?

201
00:16:16,896 --> 00:16:19,140
I mean,
it's a complicated piece of machinery.

202
00:16:19,736 --> 00:16:21,441
You don't just
press "submerge."

203
00:16:21,646 --> 00:16:23,023
Oh, I'll figure something out.

204
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,232
For all you know,
I was a commander in the navy.

205
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,323
Put your arm around my neck.
I'll lift under your knees.

206
00:16:34,498 --> 00:16:36,242
What's in the pack, John?

207
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:40,280
If you've met Mikhail, that means you
were in the communications station...

208
00:16:42,506 --> 00:16:44,580
Which means you
found the explosives.

209
00:16:46,848 --> 00:16:50,053
So you're not planning to pilot
the submarine anywhere, are you?

210
00:16:52,516 --> 00:16:54,053
You're planning to destroy it.

211
00:16:58,227 --> 00:17:00,351
I know you, John Locke.

212
00:17:03,737 --> 00:17:05,942
You don't know me at all.

213
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,442
I know you were
born in California.

214
00:17:10,366 --> 00:17:13,070
I know you were raised
in foster care.

215
00:17:13,328 --> 00:17:16,200
I know you wasted a big
part of your life in Tustin

216
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:19,451
pushing papers at a company That
manufactured industrial boxes.

217
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:26,543
I know you spent the four years Prior to
your arrival on this island in
a wheelchair.

218
00:17:30,305 --> 00:17:32,842
And I know how you
ended up in it.

219
00:17:39,148 --> 00:17:40,181
Tell me, john...

220
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,563
Did it hurt?

221
00:17:51,076 --> 00:17:53,111
I felt my back break.

222
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,240
What do you think?

223
00:18:23,026 --> 00:18:26,442
I didn't think I'd see
you again so soon, Kate.

224
00:18:30,028 --> 00:18:34,033
- Be careful in here.
- Thanks.

225
00:18:53,096 --> 00:18:54,510
Did they hurt you?

226
00:18:56,306 --> 00:18:59,183
No. Did they hurt you?

227
00:19:01,727 --> 00:19:02,601
No.

228
00:19:07,356 --> 00:19:08,642
What is all this?

229
00:19:10,815 --> 00:19:12,233
This is where they live.

230
00:19:14,657 --> 00:19:18,821
And the people they took?
The kids?

231
00:19:18,996 --> 00:19:20,413
They're all safe.

232
00:19:23,587 --> 00:19:24,491
"Safe"?

233
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:32,332
So you're with them now?

234
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:37,260
I'm not with anyone, Kate.

235
00:19:41,268 --> 00:19:44,431
- What did they do to you?
- Nothing.

236
00:19:44,645 --> 00:19:46,430
Then why are you
acting like this?

237
00:19:47,355 --> 00:19:50,891
There's no way-- You--
There's no way that I could--

238
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:53,782
I came here to help you. So why
don't you tell me what's going on?!

239
00:19:53,816 --> 00:19:56,282
I told you not to come
back here for me.

240
00:19:56,867 --> 00:19:59,112
I didn't think you meant it.

241
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:38,482
What did they do to you, Jack?

242
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:46,620
I made a deal with them.

243
00:20:48,168 --> 00:20:49,701
They're gonna let me go.

244
00:20:53,428 --> 00:20:54,372
Where?

245
00:20:57,098 --> 00:20:58,381
Home.

246
00:21:06,555 --> 00:21:07,511
When?

247
00:21:08,395 --> 00:21:10,430
First thing in the morning.

248
00:21:13,318 --> 00:21:15,560
I can bring back help.
It's our best chance.

249
00:21:15,777 --> 00:21:18,661
You trust these people? They are liars.
Why would you believe a word they--

250
00:21:18,697 --> 00:21:21,241
I trust them because
you told me to, Kate...

251
00:21:22,827 --> 00:21:27,033
When you asked me to
save Sawyer's life.

252
00:21:31,877 --> 00:21:36,923
Jack... What did they tell you?

253
00:21:41,965 --> 00:21:44,841
Jack, we need to go.

254
00:21:47,555 --> 00:21:48,891
I'll be right there.

255
00:21:58,236 --> 00:22:01,612
I asked you not to come back
here for me, and I wish...

256
00:22:03,787 --> 00:22:06,573
I wish that you hadn't.

257
00:22:12,627 --> 00:22:15,792
But I will come
back here for you.

258
00:22:47,457 --> 00:22:48,663
John Locke?

259
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:49,660
Yeah?

260
00:22:49,876 --> 00:22:53,873
Detective Mason. That's Detective Reed.
Do you mind if we ask you a
few questions?

261
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:54,950
No, of course not.

262
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,040
Do you know a man
named Peter Talbot?

263
00:23:00,636 --> 00:23:01,792
No, I don't think so.

264
00:23:02,097 --> 00:23:04,252
Thin, brown hair, 20s?

265
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:08,182
If it'll be helpful, we believe he was
here in your apartment two days ago.

266
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:11,513
Oh! Oh, oh, yeah.
Yeah, he was a solicitor.

267
00:23:11,685 --> 00:23:13,512
I-I, uh, i sent him away.

268
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:17,391
Mr. Talbot's family is worth somewhere
in the neighborhood of $200 million.

269
00:23:18,066 --> 00:23:19,193
So I'm curious.

270
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,731
What exactly was he
selling you door-to-door?

271
00:23:22,198 --> 00:23:24,070
Well, I--
Look, I told you I don't know him.

272
00:23:24,235 --> 00:23:27,900
Then why was your name and address on a
piece of paper in his pocket, Mr. Locke?

273
00:23:29,455 --> 00:23:31,991
Why were you-- Would you be
looking through his pockets?

274
00:23:32,707 --> 00:23:34,623
Because Peter Talbot's dead.

275
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:42,713
It wasn't easy, you know...

276
00:23:44,467 --> 00:23:47,052
Being in that hatch with
you all that time...

277
00:23:47,268 --> 00:23:50,051
Knowing you had no
business walking around,

278
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:53,600
Knowing I couldn't even ask you about it
without telling you who I really was.

279
00:23:53,977 --> 00:23:55,721
So ask me now...

280
00:23:57,776 --> 00:24:01,903
Now that I know
who you really are.

281
00:24:04,406 --> 00:24:05,821
Was it immediate?

282
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,781
It started the
moment you got here?

283
00:24:09,707 --> 00:24:11,412
- Yeah.
- And you were just walking--

284
00:24:11,746 --> 00:24:14,031
The feeling returned right
after the crash, that day?

285
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:15,661
That's what
"immediate" means, Ben.

286
00:24:18,508 --> 00:24:21,962
You're wondering why it
hasn't happened for you.

287
00:24:22,126 --> 00:24:25,632
You're not recovering
as fast as you'd like.

288
00:24:26,678 --> 00:24:28,800
How long's it been
since Jack fixed you?

289
00:24:29,305 --> 00:24:30,552
A week?

290
00:24:31,267 --> 00:24:32,723
Now that I think about it,

291
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:35,102
how did you get sick
in the first place?

292
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,470
Are you afraid
it'll go away, John?

293
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:40,392
Is that why you want to
destroy the submarine--

294
00:24:40,648 --> 00:24:43,850
Because you know if you ever leave this
island, you'll be back in the chair?

295
00:24:47,488 --> 00:24:49,151
You got anything to eat?

296
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:09,212
Hey!

297
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:11,671
Go on home, kid.

298
00:25:12,055 --> 00:25:13,653
You know you're not
supposed to be here.

299
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:16,051
My father sent me
to get his pack.

300
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:20,561
Why?

301
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:23,772
I don't know, Ryan,
but he told me to get it.

302
00:25:24,146 --> 00:25:27,191
All right. Here you go.

303
00:25:32,955 --> 00:25:34,450
You're Alex, aren't you?

304
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:37,242
Hey! Can it.

305
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:39,411
How do you know my name?

306
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:42,962
Because you look
like your mother.

307
00:25:45,255 --> 00:25:46,793
My mother is dead.

308
00:25:48,595 --> 00:25:50,420
I'm sure that's
what they told you.

309
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,633
Get going, Alex!

310
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:03,892
Keep your mouth shut.

311
00:26:12,408 --> 00:26:13,993
Where do you get electricity?

312
00:26:14,246 --> 00:26:18,371
We have two giant hamsters running on a
massive wheel at our secret
underground lair.

313
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:19,993
Yeah, that's funny.

314
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,411
There's leftovers in the refrigerator.
Help yourself.

315
00:26:33,808 --> 00:26:36,261
I ate most of the
dark meat. Sorry.

316
00:26:40,895 --> 00:26:45,852
Mmm. I never really appreciated
chicken until right now.

317
00:26:47,068 --> 00:26:49,352
I know you think you
need to do this, John,

318
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:51,362
but if you blow
up my submarine,

319
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,150
I'll have a big
problem with my people.

320
00:26:53,615 --> 00:26:56,780
Is that supposed to be an
incentive not to blow it up?

321
00:26:59,416 --> 00:27:03,240
I was born on this island.
Not many of my people can say that.

322
00:27:03,545 --> 00:27:05,621
Most of them were
recruited and brought here.

323
00:27:05,756 --> 00:27:07,661
And as much as they
love this place,

324
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:10,132
as much as they would do
anything to defend it,

325
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:13,052
they need to know they
can leave if they want to.

326
00:27:14,096 --> 00:27:16,223
The sub maintains
that illusion.

327
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:19,130
- So you're lying to 'em.
- No.

328
00:27:19,227 --> 00:27:21,601
They're here because
they want to be here.

329
00:27:21,896 --> 00:27:24,640
Some of them are just not ready
to make a full... commitment yet.

330
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,892
But you, John...

331
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:31,231
You've already made
that commitment,

332
00:27:31,368 --> 00:27:32,693
and now you have a choice.

333
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,692
Because if you stop
and if you think,

334
00:27:34,868 --> 00:27:36,653
I can show you things--

335
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:40,112
Things i know you want
to see very badly.

336
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:45,492
Let me put it so
you'll understand.

337
00:27:47,587 --> 00:27:49,210
Picture a box.

338
00:27:50,466 --> 00:27:53,000
You know something about boxes,
Don't you, John?

339
00:27:53,345 --> 00:27:55,882
What if I told you that
somewhere on this island

340
00:27:56,056 --> 00:27:58,051
there's a very large box,

341
00:27:58,386 --> 00:28:00,632
and whatever you imagined,

342
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:03,721
whatever you wanted
to be in it,

343
00:28:03,898 --> 00:28:06,100
when you opened that box,

344
00:28:06,186 --> 00:28:08,023
there it would be.

345
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,521
What would you say
about that, John?

346
00:28:14,865 --> 00:28:20,902
I'd say I hope that box is big enough
to imagine yourself up a new submarine.

347
00:28:23,075 --> 00:28:25,743
- Why are you so angry, John?
- Because you're cheating.

348
00:28:25,957 --> 00:28:27,240
You and your people

349
00:28:27,378 --> 00:28:30,211
communicate with the outside
world whenever you want to.

350
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,293
You come and go as you please.

351
00:28:32,426 --> 00:28:34,753
You use electricity and
running water and guns.

352
00:28:34,927 --> 00:28:37,213
You're a hypocrite, a pharisee.

353
00:28:37,676 --> 00:28:39,763
You don't deserve to
be on this island.

354
00:28:39,925 --> 00:28:43,512
If you had any idea what
this place really was,

355
00:28:44,898 --> 00:28:47,602
You wouldn't be putting
chicken in your refrigerator.

356
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,520
You've been here 80 days, John.
I've been here my entire life.

357
00:28:51,987 --> 00:28:55,110
So how is it that you think you
know this island better than I do?

358
00:28:55,948 --> 00:28:59,070
Because you're in
the wheelchair,

359
00:28:59,368 --> 00:29:00,782
and I'm not.

360
00:29:17,137 --> 00:29:18,251
Did you have any problems?

361
00:29:25,307 --> 00:29:27,010
Okay, here's how
this is gonna work--

362
00:29:27,355 --> 00:29:28,811
She's gonna take me to the sub.

363
00:29:29,016 --> 00:29:30,472
Once we're there, I let her go.

364
00:29:30,647 --> 00:29:32,680
John, she's done enough.
Let me take you.

365
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:34,481
I don't want you
to slow me down.

366
00:29:35,656 --> 00:29:37,611
Come on. Let's go.

367
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:40,190
John, before you go,
you should know...

368
00:29:41,207 --> 00:29:42,442
Jack and I made a deal.

369
00:29:43,827 --> 00:29:46,993
In less than an hour he's leaving
this island on that submarine,

370
00:29:47,205 --> 00:29:48,333
and it's a 1-way ticket.

371
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:53,833
The anomaly wiped out our
communications. We have no way of
contacting the outside world...

372
00:29:53,968 --> 00:29:58,960
Which means when that sub leaves,
it can never come back.

373
00:29:59,387 --> 00:30:01,963
So whether you destroy the
submarine or whether you let it go,

374
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:03,721
the end result is the same--

375
00:30:04,345 --> 00:30:06,391
No one will find this island.

376
00:30:09,018 --> 00:30:09,973
Let's go.

377
00:30:12,438 --> 00:30:13,523
Come on.

378
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:18,110
You know he's
manipulating you, right?

379
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:19,652
How's that?

380
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:22,651
That's what my father does.
He manipulates people.

381
00:30:23,406 --> 00:30:25,860
He makes you think it's your idea,
but it's his.

382
00:30:26,287 --> 00:30:27,990
I'll have to keep that in mind.

383
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:39,253
Submarine's down there...

384
00:30:39,846 --> 00:30:41,253
At the end of the dock.

385
00:30:43,596 --> 00:30:45,591
I'm sorry I had to
involve you in this.

386
00:31:59,256 --> 00:32:02,133
Look, I know you
don't owe me anything,

387
00:32:02,218 --> 00:32:04,253
But I need to ask you
for one last favor.

388
00:32:10,135 --> 00:32:11,932
You don't knock?

389
00:32:15,186 --> 00:32:19,270
I need you to let my
friends go after I'm gone.

390
00:32:20,065 --> 00:32:22,402
And if I said no,
would that stop you from leaving?

391
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:24,772
Of course it would.

392
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:31,360
Your friends are only
here to rescue you.

393
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:36,083
But you seem to be doing a good
job of rescuing yourself, so...

394
00:32:38,705 --> 00:32:41,711
I suppose there's no
reason to keep them here.

395
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:43,250
Do i have your word on that?

396
00:32:47,427 --> 00:32:48,842
You have my word.

397
00:32:49,977 --> 00:32:53,892
I'll let them go just as soon
as you've left the island.

398
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,611
Well, I guess this is it.

399
00:33:09,197 --> 00:33:13,822
Thank you, Ben,
for keeping your promise.

400
00:33:50,618 --> 00:33:51,401
Hey!

401
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:52,492
Hold it right there!

402
00:33:53,206 --> 00:33:56,451
Get your hands up!
Get down! I said get down!

403
00:34:07,048 --> 00:34:09,293
What are you doing here, John?

404
00:34:10,468 --> 00:34:11,800
I'm sorry, Jack.

405
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,391
Sorry for what?

406
00:34:43,585 --> 00:34:45,002
What did you do?

407
00:34:45,127 --> 00:34:45,713
John?

408
00:34:46,176 --> 00:34:48,963
Tell me you didn't do it.
- What are you talking about?

409
00:34:49,847 --> 00:34:51,711
Tell me that you
didn't kill that kid.

410
00:34:52,218 --> 00:34:53,012
What?

411
00:34:53,305 --> 00:34:56,013
You think I had something
to do with Peter's death?

412
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:59,311
I tell you to end things with his
mother, and the next thing you know,
he's dead!

413
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,812
John, now calm down, please.
Think about what you're saying.

414
00:35:01,937 --> 00:35:04,313
- Why would I kill Peter?
- He was on to you!

415
00:35:04,437 --> 00:35:07,982
John, I've been doing this for a long
time. I'm not sweating some rich kid.

416
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:09,483
Then why are you still here?

417
00:35:09,618 --> 00:35:11,322
- What do you mean?
- I tell you to leave.

418
00:35:11,448 --> 00:35:14,323
You tell me you're gonna leave town.
Why are you still here?!

419
00:35:14,908 --> 00:35:17,783
Now listen, John,
I'll be honest with you.

420
00:35:18,786 --> 00:35:22,081
I didn't end it.
I was looking for an angle.

421
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:24,543
I wanted to make some
money before I skipped out.

422
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:26,582
But then all this happened.

423
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,381
Peter died, and everything just
went straight into the tank.

424
00:35:32,258 --> 00:35:33,671
She's devastated.

425
00:35:34,678 --> 00:35:36,553
She's called off the wedding.

426
00:35:36,887 --> 00:35:39,093
There's no profit in it, John.

427
00:35:39,516 --> 00:35:42,432
I'm a con man, not a murderer.

428
00:35:44,438 --> 00:35:46,392
She called off the wedding?

429
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,900
She said she couldn't
deal with it.

430
00:35:50,236 --> 00:35:51,903
She needs to be alone.

431
00:35:52,156 --> 00:35:56,691
So if I were to call her right now,
that's what she would tell me.

432
00:35:57,826 --> 00:36:00,450
Phone's right over there, John.

433
00:36:07,297 --> 00:36:08,172
What's her numb-- Aah!

434
00:36:15,136 --> 00:36:18,341
Mr. Locke, we know this isn't
what you want to hear, but...

435
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,223
Your father's gone.

436
00:36:21,265 --> 00:36:24,640
We know he fled to Mexico
shortly after your... encounter,

437
00:36:25,065 --> 00:36:26,642
then he disappeared.

438
00:36:27,357 --> 00:36:30,190
I'm sorry, but he could be
anywhere in the world right now.

439
00:36:32,945 --> 00:36:34,983
All right, detectives,
that's enough.

440
00:36:35,116 --> 00:36:37,321
Mr. Locke has work to do today.

441
00:36:39,075 --> 00:36:41,451
We'll let you know if
anything develops.

442
00:36:41,706 --> 00:36:47,332
John, John, John, we have got ourselves
quite a day ahead of us, my friend.

443
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,212
It's finally time to get
you up out of that bed.

444
00:36:50,466 --> 00:36:52,211
No. I don't want to.

445
00:36:52,508 --> 00:36:54,380
I don't remember asking.

446
00:36:59,386 --> 00:37:00,630
Now...

447
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:04,512
Most people struggle with this at first,
but don't worry.

448
00:37:05,146 --> 00:37:06,310
You'll get used to it.

449
00:37:08,028 --> 00:37:10,391
No, wait. No, please.
I-I-I can't do this.

450
00:37:10,737 --> 00:37:14,231
John, you fell eight
stories and survived, okay?

451
00:37:14,446 --> 00:37:17,571
I don't want to hear
about what you can't do.

452
00:37:17,776 --> 00:37:19,160
Now let's go.
It's gonna be all right.

453
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:21,391
- No, I don't--
- No. It's gonna be fine, John. Come on.

454
00:37:21,456 --> 00:37:22,402
No, I can't...

455
00:37:28,207 --> 00:37:29,372
You're fine.

456
00:37:31,626 --> 00:37:32,752
There we go.

457
00:37:33,427 --> 00:37:34,791
There you go, buddy.

458
00:37:36,428 --> 00:37:40,262
See? Wasn't that bad, was it?

459
00:37:41,016 --> 00:37:42,802
Be right back, buddy.

460
00:38:20,346 --> 00:38:22,922
Well, John,
you've really gone and done it now.

461
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:26,510
You don't have to pretend
to be disappointed anymore.

462
00:38:27,437 --> 00:38:30,142
We both know you
wanted it to happen.

463
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:33,522
You left the C4 in Sayid's bag

464
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:36,690
because you wanted me
to make it happen.

465
00:38:37,445 --> 00:38:40,443
Uncuff him, please, Richard.

466
00:38:45,576 --> 00:38:47,200
You gonna do anything stupid?

467
00:38:48,538 --> 00:38:49,741
No, sir.

468
00:38:55,418 --> 00:38:57,002
Do you remember earlier, John,

469
00:38:57,295 --> 00:38:58,581
when you called me a cheater...

470
00:38:59,757 --> 00:39:02,213
When you said I didn't deserve
to live on this island?

471
00:39:02,388 --> 00:39:05,842
Well, get this--
There I was, shaking hands with Jack

472
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:09,092
and thinking I'd give almost
ything to come up with a way

473
00:39:09,265 --> 00:39:11,563
to stop him from leaving,

474
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:14,602
because to let him go would be a sign
a weakness, of failure, of defeat.

475
00:39:14,647 --> 00:39:17,520
My people would see that.
They would know it,

476
00:39:17,738 --> 00:39:19,773
and that, John,
would be the end of me.

477
00:39:19,985 --> 00:39:21,360
But to kill him...

478
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:25,113
That would be cheating,

479
00:39:25,287 --> 00:39:28,032
because my people also
heard me make a promise,

480
00:39:28,038 --> 00:39:29,702
and to break my word...

481
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,201
That would be the
end of me, too.

482
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:40,080
And then you came striding
out of the jungle, John...

483
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,670
To make my dream come true.

484
00:39:47,225 --> 00:39:50,720
You're not gonna start talking
about the magic box again, are you?

485
00:39:52,976 --> 00:39:57,773
No, John.
I'm gonna show you what came out of it.

486
00:40:09,705 --> 00:40:12,070
When I asked you
earlier if it hurt

487
00:40:12,457 --> 00:40:14,850
When you suffered your injury,
I think you misunderstood me.

488
00:40:14,876 --> 00:40:18,751
It seems fairly obvious that
when a person's back smashes

489
00:40:19,007 --> 00:40:22,753
into a hard surface after being thrown
from a building, that that's gonna sting
a little.

490
00:40:22,928 --> 00:40:26,342
But I really wasn't asking
about the physical pain.

491
00:40:26,555 --> 00:40:28,632
What, do you want to know
if it hurt my feelings?

492
00:40:28,845 --> 00:40:30,603
No, john.
I wanted to know what it felt like

493
00:40:30,635 --> 00:40:33,220
When your own father
tried to kill you.

494
00:40:36,937 --> 00:40:40,233
He's the reason you destroyed
the submarine, isn't he?

495
00:40:41,318 --> 00:40:42,440
You're afraid.

496
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:44,311
You're afraid of him,

497
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,822
and this is the one place
he can never find you.

498
00:40:47,035 --> 00:40:49,071
This is the one place
he can never get to.

499
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:50,900
What do you want from me?

500
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:55,283
I don't know how it happened...

501
00:40:57,045 --> 00:41:01,172
But you seem to have some
communion with this island, John,

502
00:41:01,377 --> 00:41:04,793
and that makes you very,
very important.

503
00:41:04,965 --> 00:41:07,300
You have no idea what you're
talking about, of course,

504
00:41:07,557 --> 00:41:10,050
but in time you'll have a
better understanding of things.

505
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:16,513
- So what do I want?
- I want to help you, John.

506
00:41:18,775 --> 00:41:19,853
Why?

507
00:41:21,196 --> 00:41:24,351
Because I'm in a wheelchair,
and you're not.

508
00:41:30,448 --> 00:41:31,902
Are you ready to see?

509
00:42:13,076 --> 00:42:14,070
Dad?

510
00:42:14,118 --> 00:42:16,110
