1
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:08,306
(Paju, Gyeonggi Province)

2
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:12,046
(Early in the morning, members are getting ready to film the show.)

3
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:14,676
Hello.

4
00:00:15,776 --> 00:00:17,776
How come you get in here as if it were your car?

5
00:00:18,376 --> 00:00:20,046
- Do I have a secret mission? - Please, wear this in your ear.

6
00:00:20,046 --> 00:00:22,446
Wait. Listen to me, please.

7
00:00:22,946 --> 00:00:24,176
What's this?

8
00:00:24,276 --> 00:00:27,006
Please follow the instructions given through this in-ear headphones.

9
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:28,846
- Through this? What's going on? - Wear that in your left ear.

10
00:00:28,846 --> 00:00:30,276
But this is my right ear.

11
00:00:30,776 --> 00:00:32,006
What? What's going on?

12
00:00:32,306 --> 00:00:33,476
Why?

13
00:00:33,776 --> 00:00:34,806
What's all this?

14
00:00:35,346 --> 00:00:36,806
(A car opens.)

15
00:00:37,476 --> 00:00:38,476
What's going on?

16
00:00:38,476 --> 00:00:40,376
(This is such an absurd way to start the show.)

17
00:00:40,376 --> 00:00:41,576
Hello.

18
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:43,976
Hello. What's all this?

19
00:00:43,976 --> 00:00:45,446
(Finally, they are greeting each other.)

20
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:46,606
Kwang Soo.

21
00:00:47,076 --> 00:00:48,506
- Hello, Jae Seok. - Hey, Gary.

22
00:00:49,246 --> 00:00:50,706
- Seok Jin, Hello. - Hi, Jae Seok.

23
00:00:50,946 --> 00:00:54,646
- Hello. - Kwang Soo, stop saying 'hello'.

24
00:00:58,706 --> 00:01:01,706
(There's someone.)

25
00:01:01,706 --> 00:01:06,616
(You must follow the orders given to you through the radio.)

26
00:01:06,616 --> 00:01:07,876
You want me to stop greeting them?

27
00:01:07,876 --> 00:01:09,246
I don't hear anything.

28
00:01:09,246 --> 00:01:11,076
Go five steps forward.

29
00:01:11,116 --> 00:01:12,576
- What? - I don't hear anything.

30
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,116
(It's not so bad if the orders are like this.)

31
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:17,146
Why can't I greet them?

32
00:01:17,146 --> 00:01:18,146
Go on your stomach.

33
00:01:18,206 --> 00:01:20,146
- Pardon? - Go on your stomach.

34
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:22,876
(Get down, Kwang Soo.)

35
00:01:23,446 --> 00:01:24,606
What is this?

36
00:01:24,606 --> 00:01:25,676
(He doesn't even question.)

37
00:01:25,676 --> 00:01:26,676
What are you doing?

38
00:01:26,906 --> 00:01:29,606
(The members are getting suspicious of Kwang Soo.)

39
00:01:29,606 --> 00:01:31,376
Five push-ups.

40
00:01:31,376 --> 00:01:34,306
(The orders are getting harder.)

41
00:01:35,876 --> 00:01:38,206
- Jae Seok. - Yes?

42
00:01:39,146 --> 00:01:40,846
Roll forward.

43
00:01:41,706 --> 00:01:43,706
Why should I?

44
00:01:44,106 --> 00:01:47,406
- Who are you? Why? - Roll forward.

45
00:01:47,406 --> 00:01:48,876
(Jae Seok starts off with rolling forward.)

46
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:49,876
(Plopping)

47
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,576
What is this about?

48
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:54,606
- Kim Jong Kook. - Yes.

49
00:01:55,646 --> 00:01:56,906
Pull up your shirt.

50
00:01:58,276 --> 00:01:59,406
Pull up my shirt?

51
00:02:00,106 --> 00:02:03,746
No. You have to show your skin.

52
00:02:04,746 --> 00:02:06,406
- Show some skin. - Pardon?

53
00:02:06,406 --> 00:02:07,576
(He's surprised.)

54
00:02:07,946 --> 00:02:11,306
Pull up your shirt for about 20cm.

55
00:02:11,306 --> 00:02:12,576
You want me to pull it up?

56
00:02:12,806 --> 00:02:14,346
20cm.

57
00:02:15,406 --> 00:02:17,046
(Roar)

58
00:02:17,046 --> 00:02:19,676
- Stay like this. - What do you want me to do?

59
00:02:19,946 --> 00:02:23,306
- Stay like this. - Isn't it too much to do this?

60
00:02:23,306 --> 00:02:25,876
It's okay. They'll blur it out for you.

61
00:02:25,876 --> 00:02:27,016
What? What do you want me to do?

62
00:02:27,016 --> 00:02:28,516
(It's been blurred perfectly.)

63
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:29,606
I have it up.

64
00:02:30,206 --> 00:02:33,806
We have an emergency order.

65
00:02:33,876 --> 00:02:38,406
Now, you must find the hidden chair number one...

66
00:02:38,706 --> 00:02:42,306
and put it on the mat. That team will get an advantage.

67
00:02:42,906 --> 00:02:45,946
- Kwang Soo, this is the mission. - You need to find...

68
00:02:45,946 --> 00:02:47,206
(They must find the chair first.)

69
00:02:47,206 --> 00:02:49,876
(They're giving the order to their trustworthy avatars.)

70
00:02:49,876 --> 00:02:53,876
- You have to find chair number one. - Find it, then you have to bring...

71
00:02:54,046 --> 00:02:56,476
(Avatars that understood faster leaves first.)

72
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:57,576
Hurry and find it.

73
00:02:57,806 --> 00:03:01,746
Find chair number one and put it on the mat.

74
00:03:02,876 --> 00:03:05,306
While looking for the chair,

75
00:03:05,646 --> 00:03:08,906
say "I'm ugly" three times.

76
00:03:09,006 --> 00:03:10,706
I'm ugly.

77
00:03:11,446 --> 00:03:13,506
(The avatar's life is so busy.)

78
00:03:13,506 --> 00:03:15,046
I'm ugly.

79
00:03:15,746 --> 00:03:18,106
I'm ugly.

80
00:03:18,676 --> 00:03:20,206
Run, run, run.

81
00:03:20,206 --> 00:03:21,806
Where is the Japanese chair?

82
00:03:22,106 --> 00:03:24,146
Chair number one. It's chair number one.

83
00:03:24,146 --> 00:03:25,306
(You're not looking for a Japanese chair.)

84
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:27,646
Chair number one, not a Japanese hair.

85
00:03:27,746 --> 00:03:28,776
Chair number one...

86
00:03:28,906 --> 00:03:30,906
Hurry up. Find it, Kwang Soo.

87
00:03:30,906 --> 00:03:32,446
I want to find it, too.

88
00:03:33,706 --> 00:03:36,006
Hold on. Can you get up for a second?

89
00:03:36,606 --> 00:03:39,106
- I think Seok Jin found it. - Yes.

90
00:03:39,106 --> 00:03:41,406
Go and stop Seok Jin.

91
00:03:41,406 --> 00:03:42,646
(They found chair number one.)

92
00:03:42,646 --> 00:03:45,276
- Stop Seok Jin. Stop Seok Jin. - Go stop Seok Jin.

93
00:03:45,276 --> 00:03:46,446
You can do it, Seok Jin.

94
00:03:46,846 --> 00:03:48,006
Come on, Seok Jin.

95
00:03:48,746 --> 00:03:49,776
Let's get out first.

96
00:03:49,776 --> 00:03:52,646
Seok Jin, tell them you made an acrostic poem about the chair.

97
00:03:53,346 --> 00:03:56,576
I have to do well. I made a good poem about the chair.

98
00:03:56,576 --> 00:03:58,606
- Really? - Why would you do that?

99
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:01,146
- It won't be good. - What are you trying to do?

100
00:04:01,276 --> 00:04:02,746
- Help me start off. - Chair.

101
00:04:03,146 --> 00:04:04,976
- Chair. - Call the doctor.

102
00:04:05,006 --> 00:04:06,006
- Call the doctor! - Wait...

103
00:04:06,006 --> 00:04:07,146
If you steal this...

104
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:08,146
All right.

105
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,046
Jong Kook, get ready to throw a punch.

106
00:04:10,106 --> 00:04:11,506
All right, that's all I have.

107
00:04:12,206 --> 00:04:13,876
- How do I snatch this? - All right, that's all I have.

108
00:04:13,876 --> 00:04:14,876
(Slapping)

109
00:04:15,906 --> 00:04:17,406
Why are you being like that?

110
00:04:17,406 --> 00:04:19,376
Seok Jin's master.

111
00:04:19,376 --> 00:04:20,676
Put it down.

112
00:04:21,046 --> 00:04:23,146
- Let's put it down. - Put it down.

113
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:27,006
You have to take the chair to the blue mat and sit on it.

114
00:04:27,006 --> 00:04:29,676
- Focus. - Jong Kook, sit on it.

115
00:04:29,676 --> 00:04:30,676
(Of course he tries to cheat.)

116
00:04:30,706 --> 00:04:32,746
- You're disqualified. - Sit on it. Sit on it.

117
00:04:32,876 --> 00:04:35,246
Good job, Jong Kook. Just kick him.

118
00:04:35,906 --> 00:04:37,246
Steal it, Kwang Soo.

119
00:04:37,576 --> 00:04:39,316
Hurry. You have to sit on the chair.

120
00:04:39,316 --> 00:04:40,476
(Chaos)

121
00:04:41,006 --> 00:04:43,946
- Haha, take the mat and run. - Go on the mat.

122
00:04:44,146 --> 00:04:45,276
Let's do rock-paper-scissors.

123
00:04:45,276 --> 00:04:46,576
- Run away. - Get him.

124
00:04:46,576 --> 00:04:49,576
(Haha is running away with the mat.)

125
00:04:49,576 --> 00:04:51,476
It's useless without the mat. Those fools.

126
00:04:51,476 --> 00:04:52,676
Hey!

127
00:04:54,246 --> 00:04:55,476
(He succeeds in sitting.)

128
00:04:55,476 --> 00:04:56,876
Good work.

129
00:04:56,876 --> 00:04:58,006
(Jong Kook is so good.)

130
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,276
You did well. Good boy.

131
00:05:00,146 --> 00:05:01,906
Good boy. They called me a good boy.

132
00:05:01,906 --> 00:05:04,146
- We have to follow orders. - It's hard.

133
00:05:04,146 --> 00:05:05,976
We didn't do anything, but I'm already tired.

134
00:05:06,146 --> 00:05:09,316
Jae Seok, we'll bring in your master.

135
00:05:09,316 --> 00:05:11,606
Who is it? I'm so curious.

136
00:05:11,606 --> 00:05:13,146
- Jae Seok, was it a woman? - She...

137
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,046
- She sounded a bit mature. - Really?

138
00:05:15,046 --> 00:05:16,646
(Who could it be?)

139
00:05:16,646 --> 00:05:18,406
- You can tell. - Could it be Ahn Moon Sook?

140
00:05:18,406 --> 00:05:19,576
She wasn't that old.

141
00:05:20,206 --> 00:05:22,906
(Could she be...)

142
00:05:23,276 --> 00:05:25,576
- Right? - You're right.

143
00:05:25,906 --> 00:05:27,276
Seriously?

144
00:05:27,276 --> 00:05:29,376
- Seo Ji Hye. - Wow.

145
00:05:29,876 --> 00:05:33,576
(She's an actress starring in "Jealousy Incarnate".)

146
00:05:33,576 --> 00:05:36,206
- I was her teacher. - Yes, that's right.

147
00:05:36,206 --> 00:05:37,306
Pardon? Do you know me?

148
00:05:37,606 --> 00:05:39,106
Seo Ji Hye. Am I wrong?

149
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:40,776
- It's Seo Ji Hye. - How did you know me 10 years ago?

150
00:05:40,876 --> 00:05:44,106
- I met you on a different show. - 10 years ago?

151
00:05:44,106 --> 00:05:46,006
- Where? - Ji Hye has no idea.

152
00:05:46,006 --> 00:05:47,106
This is embarrassing.

153
00:05:47,106 --> 00:05:48,646
- What's wrong with you? - What's your problem?

154
00:05:48,706 --> 00:05:50,106
You don't even know her.

155
00:05:50,106 --> 00:05:52,876
- I'm embarrassed for him. - It was on a different show...

156
00:05:52,876 --> 00:05:54,676
- Stop it. - Don't you remember me?

157
00:05:55,306 --> 00:05:57,376
- She really doesn't know you. - She changed.

158
00:05:57,376 --> 00:05:59,306
- You put me in an awkward position. - She changed.

159
00:05:59,306 --> 00:06:01,406
- She's surprised. - I'm sorry.

160
00:06:01,406 --> 00:06:04,606
- We've met before, right? - I'm in a very awkward position.

161
00:06:04,606 --> 00:06:06,406
Haha made it really awkward.

162
00:06:07,406 --> 00:06:09,146
- Do you really not remember? - Haha, stop it.

163
00:06:09,146 --> 00:06:11,546
- Jong Kook. - What's wrong with you?

164
00:06:11,846 --> 00:06:14,476
- Don't be so pathetic. - I remember she was on some shows.

165
00:06:14,476 --> 00:06:15,906
She was.

166
00:06:15,906 --> 00:06:17,206
- What? - I didn't do that many.

167
00:06:17,206 --> 00:06:18,876
- "The War of Roses". - Yes, "The War of Roses".

168
00:06:18,876 --> 00:06:20,476
- Is this true? - Were you in it, too?

169
00:06:20,476 --> 00:06:24,106
- I was really the bomb. - Forget it. Stop being a loser.

170
00:06:24,306 --> 00:06:25,306
You were in it, too?

171
00:06:25,306 --> 00:06:26,806
He says he was the bomb.

172
00:06:26,806 --> 00:06:28,876
- You had no presence. - I was really awesome.

173
00:06:28,976 --> 00:06:30,146
(Seo Ji Hye)

174
00:06:30,146 --> 00:06:34,876
(She appeared on a variety show in 2002 as a college student.)

175
00:06:36,606 --> 00:06:39,576
(Haha was ignored.)

176
00:06:40,306 --> 00:06:41,806
(Just like 14 years ago, he's ignored again.)

177
00:06:41,806 --> 00:06:44,376
She didn't think she saw you at a place like that.

178
00:06:44,846 --> 00:06:45,846
You've changed.

179
00:06:45,846 --> 00:06:46,846
No...

180
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:48,676
Why are you saying that?

181
00:06:48,676 --> 00:06:53,176
- Next, it's Haha's master. - Good, good.

182
00:06:53,506 --> 00:06:56,106
- I hope it's someone Haha knows. - Me, too.

183
00:06:56,476 --> 00:06:58,106
(Muscular)

184
00:06:58,106 --> 00:07:00,206
- You said it's a man, right? - What is this?

185
00:07:00,206 --> 00:07:01,276
What's with the leg?

186
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,706
- It's Kim Joon Hyun. - It's Joon Hyun.

187
00:07:04,746 --> 00:07:05,906
Nice ankle.

188
00:07:06,776 --> 00:07:08,046
Are we shooting a food show today?

189
00:07:08,576 --> 00:07:10,776
- Why are you sweating already? - What?

190
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:12,876
They gave me a long sleeve shirt since it's fall.

191
00:07:12,876 --> 00:07:14,446
Usually we don't have lining inside.

192
00:07:14,776 --> 00:07:16,006
- Kwang Soo. - Yes.

193
00:07:16,006 --> 00:07:17,106
It was a woman's voice.

194
00:07:17,106 --> 00:07:19,306
- A woman? - I hope you have bad luck.

195
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:23,606
- Why? - Seok Jin or Kwang Soo has Ji Hyo.

196
00:07:26,206 --> 00:07:27,206
Come on, Ji Hyo.

197
00:07:27,206 --> 00:07:28,376
(They are right.)

198
00:07:28,376 --> 00:07:30,006
- I told you. - It's Ji Hyo.

199
00:07:30,106 --> 00:07:32,706
- You got it right. - Her entrance is so scary.

200
00:07:32,906 --> 00:07:36,476
Ji Hyo came to work today.

201
00:07:37,046 --> 00:07:38,446
It's going to be a fierce game.

202
00:07:38,946 --> 00:07:40,906
- Kim Jong Kook. - It's a beauty.

203
00:07:41,006 --> 00:07:42,006
- Is it a beauty? - Yes.

204
00:07:42,206 --> 00:07:43,676
- I'm excited. - I can't wait.

205
00:07:43,676 --> 00:07:44,746
- Do Yeon? - It's Do Yeon.

206
00:07:44,746 --> 00:07:47,106
- Balloon. Look at the balloon. - Her arm is like a man's.

207
00:07:47,146 --> 00:07:48,806
That's not Jang Do Yeon.

208
00:07:48,806 --> 00:07:50,806
- Is it not? -That's a man.

209
00:07:50,806 --> 00:07:53,076
- It's not her. - It's Jang Do Yeon.

210
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,846
- I told you. - Yes.

211
00:07:56,046 --> 00:07:57,376
How great.

212
00:07:58,006 --> 00:08:00,946
- She cut her hair. - Her orders were great.

213
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,506
- Hello. - Hello.

214
00:08:02,906 --> 00:08:04,546
- Your haircut suits you. - Yes.

215
00:08:04,746 --> 00:08:06,706
- Liar. - He thought you were a man.

216
00:08:06,876 --> 00:08:08,976
Who said my arm is like a man's?

217
00:08:09,046 --> 00:08:11,576
You look more like Goo Bon Seung with this hair.

218
00:08:11,576 --> 00:08:13,706
- Really? - You're exactly the same.

219
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:15,106
(They're like twins.)

220
00:08:15,106 --> 00:08:17,506
- Goo Bon Seung? - Goo Bon Seung.

221
00:08:17,506 --> 00:08:18,876
- I'm curious. - I guess you can get confused.

222
00:08:18,876 --> 00:08:20,746
Seok Jin, did you have a man?

223
00:08:21,006 --> 00:08:22,846
Yes.

224
00:08:22,846 --> 00:08:25,106
- He made him recite poems. - That poem was...

225
00:08:25,146 --> 00:08:27,546
- It's Se Chan. - Se Chan.

226
00:08:27,576 --> 00:08:29,406
- It's Se Chan. - Hey, Se Chan.

227
00:08:29,406 --> 00:08:31,106
- Hey, Se Chan. - Again?

228
00:08:31,106 --> 00:08:33,006
(They're back together again.)

229
00:08:33,106 --> 00:08:34,646
Why do you complain about the poems?

230
00:08:34,676 --> 00:08:35,806
It was funny, wasn't it?

231
00:08:35,876 --> 00:08:38,246
(We fear for this team.)

232
00:08:38,746 --> 00:08:40,876
Is there an award for the winners?

233
00:08:40,876 --> 00:08:43,006
He's right. I was treated badly.

234
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:44,576
What is this?

235
00:08:44,576 --> 00:08:45,806
- Who is that? - What is that?

236
00:08:45,806 --> 00:08:47,376
- Blond hair. - It's an idol!

237
00:08:47,376 --> 00:08:49,046
- No, no. - An idol?

238
00:08:49,046 --> 00:08:50,916
(Who is Gary's master?)

239
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:54,076
Min Ho.

240
00:08:54,606 --> 00:08:55,706
(Min Ho)

241
00:08:55,876 --> 00:08:58,506
Why are you making him stand beside me?

242
00:08:58,846 --> 00:09:00,676
Is it a penalty for Gary?

243
00:09:00,846 --> 00:09:03,506
- You'll look so ugly today. - This is a penalty.

244
00:09:03,846 --> 00:09:07,106
- Two handsome guys. - Get in the shot with him.

245
00:09:07,106 --> 00:09:09,106
This is really a bad target.

246
00:09:09,106 --> 00:09:11,306
No pose can make me look better.

247
00:09:11,376 --> 00:09:13,306
I'll just let it go.

248
00:09:13,306 --> 00:09:16,006
- We're treating Min Ho well. - You're so handsome.

249
00:09:16,006 --> 00:09:18,046
Today's race,

250
00:09:18,046 --> 00:09:21,476
as you have just experienced, is Avatar House.

251
00:09:21,476 --> 00:09:22,776
It's so great.

252
00:09:24,246 --> 00:09:27,546
The guests will become...

253
00:09:27,576 --> 00:09:31,046
our members' masters to do the race.

254
00:09:31,106 --> 00:09:34,546
There are 12 bags in front of you.

255
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:40,276
In them, there are two bags with bombs and one with gold.

256
00:09:40,876 --> 00:09:45,606
Each team is to choose a bag to enter the house.

257
00:09:46,206 --> 00:09:50,916
After every game, the winning team has a chance to change bags.

258
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:55,206
The team that ends up with both bombs...

259
00:09:55,506 --> 00:09:57,246
will be getting a huge penalty.

260
00:09:58,106 --> 00:09:59,446
It's already bad as it is.

261
00:09:59,806 --> 00:10:01,446
- Go. - Go ahead.

262
00:10:02,176 --> 00:10:03,676
(The bombs are in bags between 7 and 12.)

263
00:10:03,676 --> 00:10:04,746
This one.

264
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,476
She picked one.

265
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:08,606
Did they get the answer?

266
00:10:08,606 --> 00:10:09,776
As for me...

267
00:10:11,306 --> 00:10:13,476
One, two, three, four, five and six.

268
00:10:13,476 --> 00:10:15,606
- There's something inside. - Jong Kook has the gold.

269
00:10:15,846 --> 00:10:17,416
- It could be the bomb. - It's a bomb.

270
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,746
The rest of you can select your bags.

271
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,876
- This one is leftover. - Shake it.

272
00:10:22,946 --> 00:10:25,746
It's heavy. It's so heavy.

273
00:10:26,046 --> 00:10:27,776
- He's good at acting. - It's heavy.

274
00:10:27,776 --> 00:10:29,246
That's a lie.

275
00:10:29,746 --> 00:10:33,206
(Everyone is using tricks.)

276
00:10:33,206 --> 00:10:34,376
It's so heavy.

277
00:10:34,606 --> 00:10:36,046
Joon Hyun is the best.

278
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,776
Let's move to the Avatar House.

279
00:10:38,776 --> 00:10:39,776
- Okay. - Okay.

280
00:10:39,776 --> 00:10:41,416
(They're entering Avatar House.)

281
00:10:42,006 --> 00:10:43,206
(Avatar House)

282
00:10:43,206 --> 00:10:45,676
- What is this? - What's that?

283
00:10:46,676 --> 00:10:49,476
No way. We're not sitting on the small seats, right?

284
00:10:49,476 --> 00:10:51,106
Gosh, they're so cute.

285
00:10:51,106 --> 00:10:52,806
- Sit here, Master. - Seok Jin.

286
00:10:52,806 --> 00:10:54,416
- Yes. - Escort your master.

287
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:55,416
Yes, Sir.

288
00:10:55,506 --> 00:10:57,746
- I'm your master. - Yes, Sir.

289
00:10:57,746 --> 00:10:59,876
- Seok Jin. - Yes, Master.

290
00:10:59,876 --> 00:11:01,506
Even the chairs?

291
00:11:01,506 --> 00:11:03,146
Give me some carbohydrates.

292
00:11:03,146 --> 00:11:05,206
- Carbohydrates? - Give me carbohydrates.

293
00:11:05,746 --> 00:11:07,546
Master, please lie down.

294
00:11:07,576 --> 00:11:08,746
- Seok Jin. - Yes, Master.

295
00:11:08,746 --> 00:11:11,146
How dare you. Go sit on the floor.

296
00:11:11,646 --> 00:11:12,646
Yes, Sir.

297
00:11:12,646 --> 00:11:13,706
Can you bring me some snacks?

298
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,446
Snacks? Which one?

299
00:11:15,746 --> 00:11:17,806
- I want cookies. - Okay.

300
00:11:19,306 --> 00:11:21,306
Don't lean on your back.

301
00:11:23,206 --> 00:11:25,606
My master is pretending to be mean when he's actually really nice.

302
00:11:26,446 --> 00:11:27,806
I know you're a nice guy.

303
00:11:27,806 --> 00:11:29,846
My heart is beating so fast right now.

304
00:11:29,846 --> 00:11:31,106
I don't like being rude.

305
00:11:31,106 --> 00:11:32,606
My master is very popular right now.

306
00:11:32,606 --> 00:11:34,406
- What? - My master is very popular.

307
00:11:34,406 --> 00:11:36,076
- Stop it. - Why?

308
00:11:36,076 --> 00:11:37,676
- Quiet down, Seok Jin. - Yes, Sir.

309
00:11:37,676 --> 00:11:39,746
How old are your avatar?

310
00:11:40,246 --> 00:11:41,506
I'm almost 60.

311
00:11:42,406 --> 00:11:43,606
(50 Years a Slave)

312
00:11:44,306 --> 00:11:46,646
- He should be set free now. - He was born a long time ago.

313
00:11:46,646 --> 00:11:49,246
Shouldn't you let him go by now?

314
00:11:49,246 --> 00:11:50,746
He's like an insurance at this point.

315
00:11:50,746 --> 00:11:52,476
This guy is a loyal slave.

316
00:11:52,906 --> 00:11:54,006
Spit it out.

317
00:11:55,146 --> 00:11:56,376
You said I could eat it.

318
00:11:56,376 --> 00:11:58,746
I told you to peel it for me, not eat it.

319
00:11:58,746 --> 00:11:59,976
Is she allowed to beat me up?

320
00:12:00,276 --> 00:12:01,406
Is she allowed to put her hands on me?

321
00:12:02,376 --> 00:12:03,546
Here.

322
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,606
You look like a dog.

323
00:12:06,806 --> 00:12:08,806
Can you do something about this?

324
00:12:08,806 --> 00:12:10,576
- Poor Kwang Soo. - I'll say.

325
00:12:10,576 --> 00:12:12,876
- This isn't right, you know. - Fine.

326
00:12:12,876 --> 00:12:14,576
Kwang Soo's a pet.

327
00:12:15,606 --> 00:12:18,346
I think I know which one of you is the master.

328
00:12:19,476 --> 00:12:22,446
- Look at them. - I'm not feeling any pressure.

329
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:24,376
I'm very comfortable with my role.

330
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:27,606
They're a prince and a servant.

331
00:12:27,606 --> 00:12:29,676
- Master. - Hold still.

332
00:12:29,846 --> 00:12:31,276
- Please. - I said hold still.

333
00:12:31,276 --> 00:12:34,106
He's obviously the prince.

334
00:12:34,876 --> 00:12:37,376
Did you all check your suitcases?

335
00:12:37,646 --> 00:12:38,946
- Can we do that now? - Yes.

336
00:12:38,946 --> 00:12:41,076
Don't let other people see you.

337
00:12:41,076 --> 00:12:43,946
You can share with your partner, but you can't see anyone else's.

338
00:12:43,946 --> 00:12:45,576
You can go check it out.

339
00:12:46,546 --> 00:12:48,246
- Let's go, Master. - Should we go now?

340
00:12:48,246 --> 00:12:50,606
Let's go over to the corner, Master.

341
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:53,676
(He's looking around.)

342
00:12:55,446 --> 00:13:02,606
(Some look relieved and others look surprised.)

343
00:13:03,706 --> 00:13:05,376
(What's this, Master?)

344
00:13:07,276 --> 00:13:10,976
I think we should put on an act.

345
00:13:11,106 --> 00:13:14,206
We have to make a good switch.

346
00:13:14,706 --> 00:13:17,006
Should I open it first?

347
00:13:17,006 --> 00:13:19,506
(The key is to swap the suitcases so the team can benefit from it.)

348
00:13:21,576 --> 00:13:24,406
I'm 100 percent certain that we're not carrying the bomb.

349
00:13:24,946 --> 00:13:26,106
See? Oh, wait.

350
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:30,506
Oh, gosh.

351
00:13:30,506 --> 00:13:31,646
(Ji Hye and Jae Seok are carrying the bomb.)

352
00:13:34,506 --> 00:13:36,306
Did you have to pick that one?

353
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:39,646
- I don't have anything. - That's good.

354
00:13:40,706 --> 00:13:42,206
This isn't good.

355
00:13:42,306 --> 00:13:43,676
- I'll open mine first. - Okay.

356
00:13:44,776 --> 00:13:46,976
(Jong Kook's suitcase is empty.)

357
00:13:47,376 --> 00:13:48,576
Is that possible?

358
00:13:51,476 --> 00:13:53,546
(Do Yeon and Jong Kook got gold.)

359
00:13:54,006 --> 00:13:55,646
I can tell you're acting, Do Yeon.

360
00:13:56,246 --> 00:13:57,746
(I'm not, actually.)

361
00:13:57,746 --> 00:14:00,546
This is good. I'm satisfied.

362
00:14:01,276 --> 00:14:03,276
Jong Kook got something. I'm sure of it.

363
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:08,276
(Who's the other one carrying the bomb?)

364
00:14:09,106 --> 00:14:12,846
(People have finished checking their suitcases.)

365
00:14:12,846 --> 00:14:14,106
This is the first mission.

366
00:14:14,106 --> 00:14:15,206
- Mission? - It's an announcement.

367
00:14:15,206 --> 00:14:18,276
- We shall begin "Spin the Bomb". - "Spin the Bomb"?

368
00:14:18,276 --> 00:14:21,306
The winner of each round gets to swap the suitcases.

369
00:14:23,176 --> 00:14:24,906
(What's going on?)

370
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,506
There's something on the screen.

371
00:14:26,506 --> 00:14:28,646
- This is the first mission. - "Back Hug Jjajangmyeon"?

372
00:14:28,646 --> 00:14:31,006
This round is called "Back Hug Jjajangmyeon".

373
00:14:31,006 --> 00:14:33,446
- It's something we're good at. - Nice.

374
00:14:33,676 --> 00:14:36,576
The master will have a blindfold on behind the avatar...

375
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:39,506
and feed the avatar jjajangmyeon while doing a back hug.

376
00:14:39,506 --> 00:14:41,306
- This is going to be hard. - So I don't get to eat it?

377
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:45,446
The team who finishes jjajangmyeon the fastest and cleanest...

378
00:14:45,446 --> 00:14:48,006
will get the chance to swap their suitcases.

379
00:14:48,006 --> 00:14:50,406
Don't worry, Master. Don't go easy on me.

380
00:14:51,576 --> 00:14:53,106
Just put it in there.

381
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:56,306
- It's really jjajangmyeon. - It's gan jjajangmyeon.

382
00:14:56,306 --> 00:14:58,046
(Here comes freshly made jjajangmyeon.)

383
00:14:58,046 --> 00:14:59,076
That looks good.

384
00:14:59,076 --> 00:15:01,946
- It's all soft once it's mixed up. - This is nice.

385
00:15:01,946 --> 00:15:04,676
- Is this seafood jjajangmyeon? - I'm so hungry for some.

386
00:15:04,776 --> 00:15:06,406
Jong Kook hasn't had jjajangmyeon for three years.

387
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,746
Can he have chicken breast instead of the noodles?

388
00:15:10,506 --> 00:15:12,906
Do you have any idea how much oil they use to make jjajangmyeon?

389
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:15,476
- Here he goes again. - Just eat it.

390
00:15:15,476 --> 00:15:17,346
It's his 1st time in 3 years eating jjajangmyeon.

391
00:15:17,346 --> 00:15:19,876
- Do Yeon, close up his mouth. - That's unbelievable.

392
00:15:19,876 --> 00:15:21,446
How else is he going to eat, then?

393
00:15:21,446 --> 00:15:22,946
(Will Jong Kook give up on his strict diet for his master?)

394
00:15:23,146 --> 00:15:26,006
- Did you take your glasses off? - Yes.

395
00:15:27,946 --> 00:15:28,946
Oh, my.

396
00:15:29,206 --> 00:15:30,906
- You're going to do it like that? - You liked that?

397
00:15:31,246 --> 00:15:32,576
I mean...

398
00:15:33,146 --> 00:15:34,606
You look thrilled.

399
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:36,776
Can avatars have feelings for their masters?

400
00:15:36,776 --> 00:15:39,046
Did you see what my master did?

401
00:15:39,046 --> 00:15:40,476
- What are you doing? - That was...

402
00:15:40,476 --> 00:15:42,176
- What? - Are you in love with your master?

403
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:44,846
- Oh, my. - What's going on here?

404
00:15:45,406 --> 00:15:47,946
She's serious.

405
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:50,146
You look too ugly to be like that right now.

406
00:15:50,146 --> 00:15:52,146
What does it have anything to do with how I look?

407
00:15:52,146 --> 00:15:53,446
Why does that matter?

408
00:15:53,446 --> 00:15:56,106
All I'm saying is that it's not a good look.

409
00:15:56,106 --> 00:15:58,306
I'll do an acrostic poem for Seok Jin.

410
00:15:58,306 --> 00:16:00,146
- This one's for him. - This should be good.

411
00:16:00,146 --> 00:16:01,346
It's about jjajangmyeon.

412
00:16:01,346 --> 00:16:02,706
- Hey, you. - "Hey, you"?

413
00:16:02,706 --> 00:16:04,346
Are you kidding me?

414
00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:05,976
Eat your noodles.

415
00:16:05,976 --> 00:16:07,106
Nice one.

416
00:16:07,306 --> 00:16:08,746
- That was good. - Did you like that?

417
00:16:08,746 --> 00:16:11,376
- I want to try next. - Did you like that?

418
00:16:11,376 --> 00:16:12,376
Who's it for?

419
00:16:12,376 --> 00:16:14,006
It's about jjajangmyeon. It's for Seok Jin again.

420
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,006
Give it a go.

421
00:16:15,006 --> 00:16:16,506
- Hey, you. - "Hey, you."

422
00:16:16,506 --> 00:16:17,906
Are you kidding me?

423
00:16:17,906 --> 00:16:19,246
I'll punch you in the face.

424
00:16:20,676 --> 00:16:22,206
That was good.

425
00:16:22,206 --> 00:16:24,006
Way to go, Master.

426
00:16:24,006 --> 00:16:25,676
- I liked the last line. - I gave it a try.

427
00:16:25,676 --> 00:16:27,606
- I think my master is ready now. - I see.

428
00:16:27,906 --> 00:16:29,076
Try it.

429
00:16:29,106 --> 00:16:30,406
Why you little...

430
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,876
Are you impersonating Joo Hyun?

431
00:16:31,876 --> 00:16:34,006
Are you kidding me?

432
00:16:34,006 --> 00:16:35,506
Can I have the noodles?

433
00:16:36,676 --> 00:16:38,106
I'm hungry right now.

434
00:16:38,106 --> 00:16:40,176
- Good one, Master. - Someone give him some noodles.

435
00:16:40,176 --> 00:16:41,976
Let's get the first round started.

436
00:16:42,846 --> 00:16:44,376
- Let's go! - Let's go!

437
00:16:44,376 --> 00:16:45,676
Go, Master!

438
00:16:45,676 --> 00:16:48,076
I've said it many times. You're not supposed to chew on it.

439
00:16:48,076 --> 00:16:49,106
Got it.

440
00:16:49,106 --> 00:16:50,446
(Understood, Master.)

441
00:16:51,006 --> 00:16:53,206
- Let's go, Kwang Soo. - Let's do this.

442
00:16:53,206 --> 00:16:54,876
Ready.

443
00:16:56,006 --> 00:16:59,676
(We have to take first place and get rid of the bomb.)

444
00:17:00,376 --> 00:17:01,976
Ready, set, go!

445
00:17:01,976 --> 00:17:03,446
Let's go.

446
00:17:05,646 --> 00:17:07,406
(She's looking for it.)

447
00:17:07,406 --> 00:17:08,646
You're doing good.

448
00:17:09,676 --> 00:17:10,976
That's too much.

449
00:17:10,976 --> 00:17:12,076
(It's a big mouthful.)

450
00:17:13,406 --> 00:17:14,706
(He tries a bite.)

451
00:17:16,246 --> 00:17:18,276
Look where the noodles end.

452
00:17:18,276 --> 00:17:20,276
This isn't "Baek Jong Won's Top 3 Chef King".

453
00:17:20,276 --> 00:17:22,546
I got it.

454
00:17:22,546 --> 00:17:23,616
Start eating.

455
00:17:25,176 --> 00:17:26,616
Stop. Don't do that.

456
00:17:26,616 --> 00:17:27,646
(Kwang Soo gets his face washed with jjajangmyeon.)

457
00:17:28,846 --> 00:17:31,246
There's no time to taste. Just push it down.

458
00:17:31,776 --> 00:17:33,876
(This is the last time I'm eating jjajangmyeon.)

459
00:17:33,876 --> 00:17:35,146
Don't taste it.

460
00:17:35,146 --> 00:17:36,206
Where are you?

461
00:17:37,706 --> 00:17:38,706
(That's not the mouth, Master.)

462
00:17:38,706 --> 00:17:41,746
- Just put it in there. - That's my eye.

463
00:17:41,776 --> 00:17:43,176
(He's eating away.)

464
00:17:44,246 --> 00:17:45,776
Stop it.

465
00:17:45,846 --> 00:17:47,676
Why are you taking so long?

466
00:17:49,206 --> 00:17:51,306
You're doing good, Master.

467
00:17:51,776 --> 00:17:52,946
(She shoves it in there.)

468
00:17:53,876 --> 00:17:55,046
Can we take a short break?

469
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,646
There's no time for that.

470
00:17:57,646 --> 00:17:59,406
- What are you talking about? - I should go like this.

471
00:17:59,406 --> 00:18:02,876
That's too much. That's way too much.

472
00:18:02,876 --> 00:18:03,906
Start eating.

473
00:18:04,146 --> 00:18:08,676
(Jjajangmyeon is good for cleansing your face with.)

474
00:18:09,246 --> 00:18:10,746
Why aren't you eating any? Start eating.

475
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,546
- My throat hurts. - Start eating!

476
00:18:13,776 --> 00:18:16,346
Don't bite. Just swallow it down.

477
00:18:17,046 --> 00:18:18,406
Less talking, more eating.

478
00:18:19,706 --> 00:18:21,776
(Jae Seok is leading, followed by Haha, Kwang Soo and Jong Kook.)

479
00:18:23,346 --> 00:18:24,976
You're doing good.

480
00:18:24,976 --> 00:18:27,646
(The master has good technique and the avatar has a big mouth.)

481
00:18:27,646 --> 00:18:29,746
- There's so much left. - Where are you?

482
00:18:30,506 --> 00:18:32,006
- Are we done? - Where are you?

483
00:18:32,176 --> 00:18:33,576
Jae Seok and Ji Hyo won.

484
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,076
No way.

485
00:18:37,676 --> 00:18:39,206
(It's clean.)

486
00:18:42,506 --> 00:18:43,976
(He's done already?)

487
00:18:44,176 --> 00:18:46,046
Why did you do so bad?

488
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:49,116
You didn't give me any time to chew on it.

489
00:18:49,116 --> 00:18:51,046
You just kept shoving more in.

490
00:18:51,206 --> 00:18:53,506
There's no time for chewing.

491
00:18:54,276 --> 00:18:55,506
Do I deserve to get beat up?

492
00:18:56,576 --> 00:18:58,746
- What's wrong this time? - Look at her.

493
00:18:58,976 --> 00:19:00,616
Just do as I say.

494
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:01,846
What is this?

495
00:19:02,706 --> 00:19:04,676
My avatar is so bad at this.

496
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:06,146
My throat hurts.

497
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:07,306
(Master, you're overly passionate.)

498
00:19:07,616 --> 00:19:09,276
- Did he make you upset? - Yes.

499
00:19:09,276 --> 00:19:12,246
He still looks very upset.

500
00:19:12,246 --> 00:19:14,976
I can't even turn my head right now. My neck muscles are sore.

501
00:19:15,276 --> 00:19:17,076
Gary was so slow.

502
00:19:17,376 --> 00:19:19,376
He even tried to shove my face down to the bowl.

503
00:19:19,376 --> 00:19:20,576
(His master isn't scared of getting his hands dirty.)

504
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,006
He pressed down on me.

505
00:19:22,006 --> 00:19:23,276
(His master isn't scared of getting his hands dirty.)

506
00:19:23,846 --> 00:19:25,846
I was just helping you.

507
00:19:26,376 --> 00:19:28,776
You poked me in the acupuncture point.

508
00:19:29,306 --> 00:19:30,506
Sorry about that.

509
00:19:30,676 --> 00:19:32,676
My master likes to win.

510
00:19:33,246 --> 00:19:34,706
She was like this.

511
00:19:35,206 --> 00:19:37,276
My master likes to win.

512
00:19:37,706 --> 00:19:39,246
She was amazing.

513
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:41,116
Do we get to swap suitcases now?

514
00:19:41,116 --> 00:19:43,616
Jae Seok and Ji Hye will be given an exchange ticket.

515
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:45,116
(Jae Seok and Ji Hye are given the chance to swap suitcases.)

516
00:19:45,116 --> 00:19:46,276
Let's see here.

517
00:19:46,276 --> 00:19:47,806
(We should get rid of the bomb.)

518
00:19:47,806 --> 00:19:49,206
You should try to get the gold.

519
00:19:49,206 --> 00:19:50,746
I want gold.

520
00:19:50,746 --> 00:19:53,376
Chances are Jong Kook has it.

521
00:19:54,046 --> 00:19:55,616
- I don't care if you take it. - What should we do?

522
00:19:55,616 --> 00:19:56,976
- We should swap one. - Okay.

523
00:19:57,176 --> 00:19:58,876
Which one do you want?

524
00:19:58,876 --> 00:20:00,276
I want this one.

525
00:20:00,746 --> 00:20:02,446
They wouldn't let their gold lying around like that.

526
00:20:02,446 --> 00:20:03,446
What are you talking about?

527
00:20:03,746 --> 00:20:05,146
(They exchange their suitcase to the one that was hidden.)

528
00:20:05,146 --> 00:20:07,946
- We could easily tell you had it. - Oh, really?

529
00:20:07,946 --> 00:20:09,116
Is that the bomb?

530
00:20:09,116 --> 00:20:10,476
We'll go with this one.

531
00:20:10,706 --> 00:20:14,906
The two teams will now check their suitcases in secret.

532
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:17,846
I think the one Jae Seok had was the bomb.

533
00:20:18,546 --> 00:20:20,846
That means Jong Kook has it now.

534
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:22,406
We'll all know who has what shortly.

535
00:20:22,406 --> 00:20:23,476
It's probably the bomb.

536
00:20:23,476 --> 00:20:24,616
My master...

537
00:20:25,306 --> 00:20:27,846
doesn't care about the game. He just wants to eat jjajangmyeon.

538
00:20:28,746 --> 00:20:31,306
Don't let my noodles get cold.

539
00:20:32,846 --> 00:20:35,806
(This is the suitcase Jae Seok and Ji Hye gave them.)

540
00:20:37,976 --> 00:20:40,506
(It's the bomb.)

541
00:20:40,776 --> 00:20:43,506
I knew it.

542
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:45,676
They'll know it's the bomb once they open it.

543
00:20:45,676 --> 00:20:49,006
(What did Jae Seok and Ji Hye get?)

544
00:20:55,306 --> 00:20:58,616
(It's gold.)

545
00:20:59,306 --> 00:21:01,806
(They got the golden touch.)

546
00:21:03,146 --> 00:21:04,306
(He falls over.)

547
00:21:05,346 --> 00:21:06,876
(He got too excited and got himself injured.)

548
00:21:06,876 --> 00:21:08,246
Oh, my butt.

549
00:21:10,946 --> 00:21:12,946
(It's quite fun to control Jae Seok actually.)

550
00:21:12,946 --> 00:21:15,746
There's gold inside. How did you know?

551
00:21:15,746 --> 00:21:18,276
- At first, I thought of Seok Jin. - Actually,

552
00:21:18,276 --> 00:21:22,446
Actually, when we stepped forward,

553
00:21:22,946 --> 00:21:26,116
- they peeked at us. - That's right. There was a hint.

554
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,376
- What took you so long? - Hurry up, Jae Seok.

555
00:21:28,376 --> 00:21:30,076
- Come on. - What's wrong with you?

556
00:21:30,076 --> 00:21:31,846
Stop setting him up and come out.

557
00:21:31,946 --> 00:21:33,446
They have both the gold and the bomb.

558
00:21:34,006 --> 00:21:36,406
What happened? Did she hug you back there?

559
00:21:36,406 --> 00:21:38,046
- Then what's wrong? - Why are you out of breath?

560
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,206
- No. Nothing. - What did you do?

561
00:21:40,206 --> 00:21:41,806
- What's the matter? - Why?

562
00:21:41,806 --> 00:21:42,976
- He looks really happy. - What's his problem?

563
00:21:42,976 --> 00:21:44,746
Now, it's time for Joon Hyun to shine.

564
00:21:44,746 --> 00:21:47,146
- He will win, of course. - Stop giving me pressure.

565
00:21:47,146 --> 00:21:48,446
- Come on. - It's your show time.

566
00:21:48,446 --> 00:21:49,846
- It's disadvantageous to us. - I just found out that...

567
00:21:49,846 --> 00:21:52,306
- Ji Hye loves to win. - I see.

568
00:21:52,376 --> 00:21:54,006
At the same time,

569
00:21:54,006 --> 00:21:55,246
- Min Ho loves to win, too. - That's right.

570
00:21:55,246 --> 00:21:57,006
Min Ho never wants to lose.

571
00:21:57,006 --> 00:22:00,406
If he gets defeated one more time,

572
00:22:00,546 --> 00:22:02,306
- he will burst out in anger. - I'm sure he will.

573
00:22:02,306 --> 00:22:04,476
Gosh. What should I do?

574
00:22:04,776 --> 00:22:05,876
I need to practise feeding my partner with chopsticks.

575
00:22:05,876 --> 00:22:08,076
And these two, I'm also sure that Kwang Soo will...

576
00:22:08,446 --> 00:22:10,206
- try to revenge. - Revenge?

577
00:22:10,206 --> 00:22:12,076
No, I won't. There's no way I'll do it.

578
00:22:12,076 --> 00:22:14,046
- I won't. We need to win. - I think...

579
00:22:14,046 --> 00:22:16,546
they will not play to win. They will play to revenge.

580
00:22:16,546 --> 00:22:18,906
- We won't be able to recognise her. - Of course not.

581
00:22:18,906 --> 00:22:20,946
- That sounds very likely. - I play to win.

582
00:22:20,946 --> 00:22:23,746
- I'm aiming for victory. - Let's see her face after the game.

583
00:22:23,806 --> 00:22:26,606
- What are these? - Why noodles?

584
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:28,776
Everybody thinks that Joon Hyun will win,

585
00:22:29,046 --> 00:22:32,106
but we need to see how things go.

586
00:22:32,276 --> 00:22:34,606
I will show you that women can also win.

587
00:22:35,076 --> 00:22:37,046
(Please go easy on me, Kwang Soo.)

588
00:22:37,406 --> 00:22:38,776
- Some can swallow this with a gulp. - Would you like some?

589
00:22:39,406 --> 00:22:40,706
No, thank you.

590
00:22:40,846 --> 00:22:42,446
She loves to cheat.

591
00:22:43,076 --> 00:22:44,846
- She really is. - You heard her, right?

592
00:22:45,606 --> 00:22:46,806
She loves to make fouls.

593
00:22:46,806 --> 00:22:48,546
I almost said, "Yes, thank you."

594
00:22:49,146 --> 00:22:51,676
- She may be quiet, but... - She cheats quietly.

595
00:22:51,676 --> 00:22:53,246
She's so kind and nice.

596
00:22:53,306 --> 00:22:54,646
- You can only use chopsticks. - Ready,

597
00:22:54,746 --> 00:22:55,806
set.

598
00:22:55,806 --> 00:22:58,106
(If they win, they can exchange bags with others.)

599
00:22:58,106 --> 00:22:59,476
(Gulping)

600
00:23:00,776 --> 00:23:02,746
(Will Joon Hyun end up winning? Let's find out.)

601
00:23:02,746 --> 00:23:04,776
Set, go!

602
00:23:04,776 --> 00:23:06,706
- Where are the chopsticks? - Yes, you got them.

603
00:23:06,706 --> 00:23:09,676
(Come on, masters. You can do it.)

604
00:23:10,476 --> 00:23:12,346
(Kwang Soo picks up a lot of jjajangmyeon.)

605
00:23:12,546 --> 00:23:13,676
She can't eat those at once.

606
00:23:13,676 --> 00:23:16,406
(Kwang Soo is taking his revenge.)

607
00:23:17,406 --> 00:23:18,946
(Pushing)

608
00:23:18,946 --> 00:23:20,706
(Seok Jin pushes Se Chan's head forward.)

609
00:23:20,976 --> 00:23:22,846
- You can do it! - Slow down.

610
00:23:23,676 --> 00:23:24,676
(They gulp everything so fast.)

611
00:23:24,676 --> 00:23:25,776
All right. There.

612
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:27,976
You need to chew.

613
00:23:27,976 --> 00:23:30,246
- You're doing great. - Don't chew. Just swallow them.

614
00:23:30,376 --> 00:23:32,576
She's doing great. She's eating really fast.

615
00:23:32,576 --> 00:23:35,206
- Come on. Swallow them. - She's amazing.

616
00:23:37,946 --> 00:23:42,106
(But we all know who's the fastest eater here.)

617
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:48,006
(He only needs to gulp few times to eat them all.)

618
00:23:49,546 --> 00:23:55,006
(Can I order some extra noodles? Thank you.)

619
00:23:55,006 --> 00:23:57,906
- We can beat Joon Hyun. - Hurry up. You're really slow.

620
00:23:58,176 --> 00:24:00,406
- Hurry up. We're almost finished. - You're taking too much time.

621
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:01,806
I think we're almost finished.

622
00:24:02,206 --> 00:24:04,406
Come on. We can do it.

623
00:24:04,406 --> 00:24:05,476
(He's the best at covering her face with sauce.)

624
00:24:05,646 --> 00:24:07,476
Come on, Se Chan!

625
00:24:10,246 --> 00:24:13,476
- Take a big gulp. - Come on. Swallow them.

626
00:24:14,246 --> 00:24:16,276
- Hurry up. Swallow. - Come on.

627
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:18,846
- Aren't we finished? - If you are, put your bowl up.

628
00:24:19,006 --> 00:24:20,546
She's really amazing.

629
00:24:20,646 --> 00:24:21,946
Hurry up. Show your empty bowl.

630
00:24:21,946 --> 00:24:23,676
- What are you doing? - Aren't you finished yet?

631
00:24:23,746 --> 00:24:25,706
- Okay. - She's unbelievable.

632
00:24:26,706 --> 00:24:28,506
- Show them your bowl. - She ate them all.

633
00:24:28,506 --> 00:24:30,306
- She finished it. - Show your bowl to them.

634
00:24:30,306 --> 00:24:32,106
- There they are. - Really? Is she finished already?

635
00:24:32,106 --> 00:24:33,506
- I can't find any noodles. - Where are they?

636
00:24:33,876 --> 00:24:35,706
- I can't find them. - Where are they?

637
00:24:35,706 --> 00:24:37,576
(Ta-da)

638
00:24:37,646 --> 00:24:39,546
All right. Haha and Joon Hyun won.

639
00:24:39,546 --> 00:24:41,006
(Haha and Joon Hyun succeed.)

640
00:24:41,006 --> 00:24:43,976
- We finished them as well. - I knew I could count on Joon Hyun.

641
00:24:44,176 --> 00:24:45,376
(I should've been faster.)

642
00:24:45,376 --> 00:24:47,946
- I finished it. - We finished them as well.

643
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:52,106
- That was really quick. - Do Yeon is unbelievable.

644
00:24:52,176 --> 00:24:54,906
(I can't accept my defeat. How could they eat so fast?)

645
00:24:54,906 --> 00:24:57,046
- That was amazing. - Do Yeon ate really quickly.

646
00:24:57,046 --> 00:24:58,606
- I ate almost everything. - Gosh.

647
00:24:58,606 --> 00:25:01,076
- Look at her bowl. It's empty. - She ate them all.

648
00:25:01,076 --> 00:25:02,646
- She ate a lot. - That was really close.

649
00:25:03,306 --> 00:25:06,206
Haha, I thought that was my hand, not yours.

650
00:25:06,206 --> 00:25:09,076
- Really? - You put noodles in just like me.

651
00:25:09,076 --> 00:25:12,146
- Joon Hyun is so nice. - That was amazing.

652
00:25:12,146 --> 00:25:13,576
- My goodness. - Gosh. Where is Ji Hyo?

653
00:25:13,576 --> 00:25:16,576
Min Ho did a great job, too. Oh my gosh. Look at Ji Hyo.

654
00:25:17,376 --> 00:25:18,676
- My goodness. - What happened?

655
00:25:19,206 --> 00:25:21,076
- That is so cruel. - What happened, Ji Hyo?

656
00:25:21,076 --> 00:25:23,676
- It's funny. Don't wipe her face. - What happened to you?

657
00:25:23,676 --> 00:25:26,276
- Take a photo before cleaning her. - Okay.

658
00:25:26,676 --> 00:25:28,706
- Anyway, what happened to her? - Take a photo of her face.

659
00:25:28,706 --> 00:25:30,106
Who did this to you?

660
00:25:30,106 --> 00:25:31,746
Is that some kind of a face pack?

661
00:25:32,046 --> 00:25:33,446
That must be a jjajang face pack.

662
00:25:33,446 --> 00:25:36,176
He even tried to open my mouth with his hand. Like this.

663
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,176
I just tried to feed you as fast as I could.

664
00:25:38,176 --> 00:25:40,876
(That's why she took her revenge by biting his thumb.)

665
00:25:40,876 --> 00:25:42,406
Ji Hyo, what are you doing?

666
00:25:43,606 --> 00:25:45,776
Ji Hye is really upset.

667
00:25:45,776 --> 00:25:47,746
Leave her. She'll calm herself down.

668
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:50,246
- Calm down. Calm your anger. - The sauce looks like a beard.

669
00:25:50,246 --> 00:25:51,446
Take your time.

670
00:25:51,546 --> 00:25:54,676
Min Ho and Ji Hye are really upset because they lost the game.

671
00:25:54,676 --> 00:25:56,706
- Don't get in their way. - I can see that.

672
00:25:56,706 --> 00:25:58,976
- Min Ho is really upset. - They really are.

673
00:25:59,106 --> 00:26:01,276
- No, I'm not. - Ji Hye did really well, too.

674
00:26:01,276 --> 00:26:03,306
- That was close. - What a pity.

675
00:26:03,306 --> 00:26:05,546
- That was really close. - Ji Hye, are you all right?

676
00:26:06,346 --> 00:26:07,946
- You don't know her. Do you? - Come on, Ji Hye.

677
00:26:07,946 --> 00:26:10,776
- Stop being too friendly. - That's all right, Ji Hye.

678
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:15,276
(Eating)

679
00:26:15,276 --> 00:26:17,476
All right. Let's take out the jjajangmyeon bowls.

680
00:26:17,476 --> 00:26:19,976
- Come on. The game's over. - Hey, I'm not done eating.

681
00:26:19,976 --> 00:26:21,976
- Let's take the dishes away. - Let him finish his meal.

682
00:26:21,976 --> 00:26:23,776
- It's finished. - Why does he keep eating?

683
00:26:23,776 --> 00:26:25,606
The game's over already.

684
00:26:25,606 --> 00:26:28,506
Haha and Joon Hyun will be given an exchange ticket.

685
00:26:28,506 --> 00:26:29,646
(They can swap one of their bags.)

686
00:26:29,646 --> 00:26:32,106
- We were so close to winning. - I'm sorry to hear that.

687
00:26:32,446 --> 00:26:33,606
We will...

688
00:26:34,406 --> 00:26:36,806
swap with Jae Seok and my sister's team.

689
00:26:37,576 --> 00:26:39,546
- That's our choice. - What do you mean, "your sister"?

690
00:26:39,546 --> 00:26:41,476
I mean Ji Hye, of course.

691
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:43,006
(Ji Hye is my sister.)

692
00:26:43,146 --> 00:26:45,306
- Don't you need my opinion? - I'm sorry, Master.

693
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:49,106
We'll swap our bag with Jae Seok and his sister's team.

694
00:26:49,106 --> 00:26:51,176
(He says exactly the same thing as Haha.)

695
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:52,206
He's so kind like an angel.

696
00:26:52,206 --> 00:26:54,406
One of their bags must be the bomb.

697
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:55,946
- Am I correct? - Yes, you are.

698
00:26:55,946 --> 00:26:57,106
I noticed something...

699
00:26:58,276 --> 00:26:59,446
(I think I can feel what's inside.)

700
00:26:59,446 --> 00:27:00,776
- Aren't they the same? - They must be the same.

701
00:27:00,906 --> 00:27:03,476
- Is there a difference? - They must be...

702
00:27:03,806 --> 00:27:06,006
- either bomb or gold. - There wouldn't be any gold inside.

703
00:27:06,006 --> 00:27:07,206
I don't think so.

704
00:27:07,676 --> 00:27:10,146
How can they weigh just the same?

705
00:27:10,146 --> 00:27:11,206
I'll swap with this bag.

706
00:27:12,076 --> 00:27:15,106
- Will you? - You're not experts at all.

707
00:27:15,406 --> 00:27:16,776
- Give one of your bags. - Come and grab one.

708
00:27:16,976 --> 00:27:18,876
Can I check what's inside?

709
00:27:19,446 --> 00:27:21,306
(Did they swap the correct bag?)

710
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,606
I think this bag is empty.

711
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,006
- I thought both bags were empty. - I felt the same.

712
00:27:26,006 --> 00:27:29,806
(Is that a gold or an empty bag? There's a 50-50 chance.)

713
00:27:29,806 --> 00:27:30,846
This side.

714
00:27:32,876 --> 00:27:33,906
- No. - It's empty.

715
00:27:33,906 --> 00:27:34,946
(They got an empty bag.)

716
00:27:34,946 --> 00:27:36,076
- It's empty, isn't it? - Yes, it is.

717
00:27:38,546 --> 00:27:41,246
- Is that the bag with gold? - Yes, this is the one.

718
00:27:41,346 --> 00:27:43,606
- Do we still have it? - Yes, they picked the wrong one.

719
00:27:43,606 --> 00:27:46,606
(The gold is still with Jae Seok and Ji Hye.)

720
00:27:48,146 --> 00:27:50,246
(It'd be the best for them if the new bag isn't the bomb.)

721
00:27:50,246 --> 00:27:52,076
In my opinion...

722
00:27:52,606 --> 00:27:53,746
- They tried to find a heavier bag. - It must be empty.

723
00:27:53,746 --> 00:27:55,676
- It must be. - Both of their bags were empty.

724
00:27:55,706 --> 00:27:58,146
- They didn't care. - Yes. Both of them must be empty.

725
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,206
- Good. - There.

726
00:27:59,206 --> 00:28:00,746
- All right. - It's great so far.

727
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:02,306
Good.

728
00:28:02,576 --> 00:28:05,276
- They are really good. - Why?

729
00:28:05,276 --> 00:28:07,506
- They are so good. - They are good at acting.

730
00:28:07,546 --> 00:28:10,806
- I didn't know. - That room makes everyone actors.

731
00:28:10,806 --> 00:28:12,146
- That's really peculiar. - What are we doing here?

732
00:28:12,146 --> 00:28:14,276
- That room changes everyone. - Everyone is acting here.

733
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:16,706
- You're so good at acting. - Master,

734
00:28:16,706 --> 00:28:19,176
- I want to go in there, too. - Jae Seok. Are you confused?

735
00:28:19,176 --> 00:28:21,106
- Yes? Yes, I am. - Look. They are acting now.

736
00:28:21,106 --> 00:28:23,106
Why does everyone act after getting out of the room?

737
00:28:23,546 --> 00:28:25,306
There must be something inside the room.

738
00:28:25,306 --> 00:28:26,706
We'd also like to go in.

739
00:28:27,146 --> 00:28:30,476
(Here comes the second round of Avatar House.)

740
00:28:30,476 --> 00:28:33,506
This round is called, "My Avatar Can".

741
00:28:33,576 --> 00:28:35,446
- What? - After checking the game,

742
00:28:35,446 --> 00:28:39,246
masters can make a bid with the number which you think...

743
00:28:39,246 --> 00:28:40,776
your avatar can achieve.

744
00:28:40,876 --> 00:28:42,346
My master will bid?

745
00:28:42,446 --> 00:28:45,276
- Trust me, Master. - Raise your hand to make your bid.

746
00:28:45,376 --> 00:28:46,506
- I'm in. - I like this kind of game.

747
00:28:46,506 --> 00:28:50,146
Only the team with the highest number can make their challenge.

748
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:52,746
- Let's play no matter what. - Call out only if you think I can.

749
00:28:52,876 --> 00:28:55,946
Gosh. I don't think you can succeed in any game, Seok Jin.

750
00:28:56,146 --> 00:28:57,346
Master, trust me.

751
00:28:57,946 --> 00:28:59,006
Please trust me.

752
00:28:59,376 --> 00:29:00,546
- Min Ho will... - My goodness.

753
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:02,906
Isn't she the famous auctioneer?

754
00:29:03,206 --> 00:29:04,446
- Amazing. - Yes, she is.

755
00:29:05,306 --> 00:29:07,346
- "What's your bid?" - "Sold!"

756
00:29:07,406 --> 00:29:09,176
- "What's your bid?" - "What's your bid?"

757
00:29:09,176 --> 00:29:11,176
She came all the way here. Hello.

758
00:29:11,176 --> 00:29:14,806
Hello, I'm auctioneer Kim Min Seo. I will host today's auction.

759
00:29:14,806 --> 00:29:16,146
(Kim Min Seo, auctioneer)

760
00:29:17,376 --> 00:29:19,876
- They brought a real auctioneer. - She has an amazing voice.

761
00:29:19,876 --> 00:29:21,246
Yes. Her voice is amazing.

762
00:29:21,246 --> 00:29:25,506
I'll give you a brief explanation about the auction.

763
00:29:25,506 --> 00:29:28,346
Only the team that makes the bid with the highest number...

764
00:29:28,346 --> 00:29:30,046
can challenge the mission.

765
00:29:30,046 --> 00:29:33,076
If the team succeeds,

766
00:29:33,246 --> 00:29:35,906
they will be given the exchange ticket.

767
00:29:37,006 --> 00:29:38,246
- Good. - Master!

768
00:29:38,446 --> 00:29:39,576
- I'll trust you this time. - What if we fail?

769
00:29:39,576 --> 00:29:42,146
- There must be a penalty. - If you challenge and fail,

770
00:29:42,146 --> 00:29:46,106
you must open and show one of your bags to everyone as a penalty.

771
00:29:46,106 --> 00:29:48,376
- That's the penalty. - Please be careful with your bids.

772
00:29:48,376 --> 00:29:51,046
- Do we need to open our bags? - Is that the penalty?

773
00:29:51,046 --> 00:29:53,446
- Yes, it is. - The penalty is huge.

774
00:29:53,446 --> 00:29:55,206
- That's tough. - Do we need to show both bags...

775
00:29:55,206 --> 00:29:57,706
- or only one? - Do we need to show only one bag?

776
00:29:57,706 --> 00:29:58,906
- Yes. One. - Okay.

777
00:29:59,076 --> 00:30:00,776
You're asking because one of your bags isn't empty, right?

778
00:30:00,776 --> 00:30:03,476
- That's right. - That was a sharp question.

779
00:30:03,476 --> 00:30:05,876
(Min Ho is a sharp detective.)

780
00:30:06,206 --> 00:30:08,846
Okay. I'll tell you the first game.

781
00:30:08,846 --> 00:30:10,646
The first game is...

782
00:30:10,746 --> 00:30:13,606
(What kind of game will they play?)

783
00:30:13,676 --> 00:30:16,346
- "Break the Bananas". - What?

784
00:30:16,476 --> 00:30:17,606
It's called "Break the Bananas".

785
00:30:17,606 --> 00:30:20,276
- What kind of game is that? - You only have one minute.

786
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,606
Please guess how many pieces your avatar can break...

787
00:30:22,606 --> 00:30:25,006
- How many pieces? I see. - Do we need to break the most?

788
00:30:25,006 --> 00:30:26,506
- Yes. - We have a minute.

789
00:30:26,506 --> 00:30:27,706
We'll break bananas for a minute.

790
00:30:27,706 --> 00:30:32,276
Please consider carefully and make your bids.

791
00:30:32,306 --> 00:30:34,076
- All right. Let's see. - It's quite easy.

792
00:30:34,076 --> 00:30:36,506
Let's try. Break one banana.

793
00:30:36,506 --> 00:30:38,306
- It's quite easy. - It's easy, isn't it?

794
00:30:38,306 --> 00:30:41,646
- Try the other way. Good job. - It's quite easy.

795
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:43,346
- What is this? - It's really easy.

796
00:30:44,446 --> 00:30:47,146
It's quite easy. We can call more than 30.

797
00:30:47,206 --> 00:30:49,506
My master is very strict and passionate.

798
00:30:49,546 --> 00:30:50,876
Why? What's the matter?

799
00:30:50,876 --> 00:30:52,606
"You can break more than 30, can't you?"

800
00:30:53,876 --> 00:30:57,176
The starting bid is 10 bananas.

801
00:30:57,176 --> 00:30:59,546
Auction begins now. 10.

802
00:30:59,676 --> 00:31:02,276
Let's bid. Let's bid first and see how things go.

803
00:31:02,746 --> 00:31:04,346
- We should bid more than 30 to win. - Yes, we should.

804
00:31:04,346 --> 00:31:05,546
(They wait for others to begin first.)

805
00:31:05,946 --> 00:31:07,276
- 10. - Okay. 10.

806
00:31:07,276 --> 00:31:09,076
- 10. - Okay. Se Chan suggested 10.

807
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:10,146
- She already got it. - 20?

808
00:31:10,176 --> 00:31:12,046
- Song Ji Hyo, 20. - You're raising too many.

809
00:31:12,046 --> 00:31:13,076
30.

810
00:31:13,146 --> 00:31:14,876
- It's rising too fast. - 30?

811
00:31:14,876 --> 00:31:16,106
Min Ho suggested 30.

812
00:31:16,106 --> 00:31:18,176
- 35. - 35 is suggested.

813
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:20,746
- You have to open your bag. - Don't forget it.

814
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:23,146
- 40. - There is 40.

815
00:31:23,146 --> 00:31:24,806
- 40? - You have to open your bag.

816
00:31:24,806 --> 00:31:25,846
45.

817
00:31:25,846 --> 00:31:28,946
- 45? - Don't forget it.

818
00:31:29,246 --> 00:31:31,276
Should we open our bags if we fail?

819
00:31:31,276 --> 00:31:33,206
- 48. - Here is 48.

820
00:31:33,906 --> 00:31:36,246
(What did you say?)

821
00:31:36,306 --> 00:31:38,746
Please consult me in advance.

822
00:31:38,746 --> 00:31:40,146
- 49. - What?

823
00:31:40,976 --> 00:31:42,646
(They don't communicate.)

824
00:31:42,646 --> 00:31:45,646
Min Ho's 49 is the highest.

825
00:31:45,646 --> 00:31:47,546
- 50. - Here is 50.

826
00:31:47,546 --> 00:31:49,246
- 50? - 60.

827
00:31:49,276 --> 00:31:50,276
(She says 60.)

828
00:31:50,276 --> 00:31:52,146
- What? - Gosh.

829
00:31:52,606 --> 00:31:54,606
The highest if Do Yeon's 60.

830
00:31:54,606 --> 00:31:56,006
I'll suggest 61.

831
00:31:56,006 --> 00:31:58,146
- Hey. - This is insane.

832
00:31:58,146 --> 00:32:01,346
Is there anyone else? 61 is the highest now.

833
00:32:01,346 --> 00:32:02,546
Somebody needs to accept this.

834
00:32:02,906 --> 00:32:04,376
No one accepts this.

835
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:05,576
Did I succeed?

836
00:32:05,946 --> 00:32:08,076
If there is no one, we'll close it.

837
00:32:08,876 --> 00:32:11,006
I'll give a chance to bid only to one team.

838
00:32:11,006 --> 00:32:12,846
- This is nerve-wrecking. - It is.

839
00:32:12,846 --> 00:32:14,476
- Now, it's 61. - 61.

840
00:32:14,506 --> 00:32:16,506
- It's the highest now. - It won't do.

841
00:32:17,046 --> 00:32:19,546
(Will this be finalised?)

842
00:32:19,546 --> 00:32:21,406
Before I count...

843
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:22,446
70.

844
00:32:23,076 --> 00:32:24,076
(She bids 70 without fear.)

845
00:32:24,076 --> 00:32:25,776
Did she say 70?

846
00:32:25,806 --> 00:32:28,876
- You can't change it. - What's wrong?

847
00:32:28,876 --> 00:32:31,646
- If it's 61... - Do it yourself then.

848
00:32:31,646 --> 00:32:34,706
There are 62, 63, 64 and so on above 61.

849
00:32:35,146 --> 00:32:37,146
(My avatar is talkative.)

850
00:32:37,406 --> 00:32:38,776
Even a machine can't do that much.

851
00:32:38,776 --> 00:32:41,046
Jang Do Yeon bid the highest so far.

852
00:32:41,046 --> 00:32:43,046
It's 70. Is there anyone else?

853
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:44,746
This is crazy. We can't bid any more.

854
00:32:44,746 --> 00:32:48,446
I'll shout the price three times before we finalise it.

855
00:32:48,876 --> 00:32:50,706
70, 70,

856
00:32:50,706 --> 00:32:52,946
70.

857
00:32:53,446 --> 00:32:55,246
Wait. 71.

858
00:32:55,876 --> 00:32:58,546
(Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo bid 71.)

859
00:32:58,546 --> 00:32:59,806
Why did you go so far?

860
00:32:59,946 --> 00:33:01,876
(The bid was like a buzzer beater.)

861
00:33:01,876 --> 00:33:03,906
I thought she called something much bigger.

862
00:33:04,246 --> 00:33:06,576
Song Ji Hyo's 71 is the highest now.

863
00:33:06,806 --> 00:33:09,546
Kwang Soo, you have to succeed in splitting them.

864
00:33:09,546 --> 00:33:11,746
It's 71 now. Will you bid more?

865
00:33:11,746 --> 00:33:13,346
- Don't bid any more. - Don't.

866
00:33:13,346 --> 00:33:14,746
71.

867
00:33:14,946 --> 00:33:15,976
(They're anxious.)

868
00:33:16,906 --> 00:33:18,076
I'll bid 80.

869
00:33:18,706 --> 00:33:20,246
(He bids 80.)

870
00:33:20,246 --> 00:33:21,246
(She's surprised.)

871
00:33:21,976 --> 00:33:24,846
Come on, come on. Kwang Soo, come on.

872
00:33:24,846 --> 00:33:26,776
It's better to open the bag.

873
00:33:27,276 --> 00:33:28,906
- Come on. - Come on.

874
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:30,606
How can I make 80 pieces?

875
00:33:30,606 --> 00:33:33,046
I'll finalise this after shouting 80 three times.

876
00:33:33,046 --> 00:33:34,046
80.

877
00:33:35,846 --> 00:33:38,246
(He challenged Kwang Soo.)

878
00:33:39,046 --> 00:33:41,046
(Should I take that challenge or not?)

879
00:33:42,246 --> 00:33:43,276
81.

880
00:33:43,846 --> 00:33:44,846
(She throws 81.)

881
00:33:44,846 --> 00:33:47,146
(Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo bid 81.)

882
00:33:48,106 --> 00:33:50,246
- It was our strategy. - Here is 81.

883
00:33:50,246 --> 00:33:51,546
Why did you accept this?

884
00:33:51,706 --> 00:33:55,906
If you bid 82, you'll have a chance to challenge.

885
00:33:55,906 --> 00:33:58,076
- Do you want to bid 82? - She's so good.

886
00:33:58,076 --> 00:34:00,046
Gosh. We need to go.

887
00:34:00,046 --> 00:34:02,706
- How many? - Now, it's 81.

888
00:34:02,706 --> 00:34:04,246
- Is she taking this? - You'll have a chance to challenge.

889
00:34:04,246 --> 00:34:05,776
(They're waging a war of nerves.)

890
00:34:07,176 --> 00:34:08,176
85.

891
00:34:08,176 --> 00:34:09,406
(Jong Kook and Do Yeon bid 85.)

892
00:34:10,076 --> 00:34:12,516
- 85? - Here is 85.

893
00:34:12,516 --> 00:34:14,046
(They bid 85 to give away the bomb.)

894
00:34:14,046 --> 00:34:15,806
I'll shout the number three times and close it.

895
00:34:15,806 --> 00:34:16,806
85,

896
00:34:17,016 --> 00:34:18,016
85...

897
00:34:19,546 --> 00:34:23,446
(Jong Kook will have a chance to challenge in this situation.)

898
00:34:23,446 --> 00:34:26,016
(Will it be finalised?)

899
00:34:26,016 --> 00:34:28,746
85. It's auctioned off.

900
00:34:29,606 --> 00:34:31,046
(They bid 85 successfully.)

901
00:34:31,046 --> 00:34:32,046
Let's see.

902
00:34:32,046 --> 00:34:34,846
I've seen that on TV...

903
00:34:34,846 --> 00:34:36,646
- but it's impossible. - Is it?

904
00:34:36,646 --> 00:34:38,876
- Is this impossible? - Muscles are useless.

905
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:41,346
- Our strategy worked. - Yes, it worked.

906
00:34:42,406 --> 00:34:44,016
- 85? - Wow, is this it?

907
00:34:44,046 --> 00:34:45,846
- 85? - Wow, is this it?

908
00:34:45,846 --> 00:34:47,046
(85 bananas come in.)

909
00:34:47,546 --> 00:34:50,646
They're not ripe yet.

910
00:34:50,646 --> 00:34:52,706
I think he can do it.

911
00:34:52,706 --> 00:34:54,176
He can squeeze and split them.

912
00:34:54,176 --> 00:34:57,176
You need to split 85 of them in a minute.

913
00:34:57,176 --> 00:34:59,476
- Jong Kook will challenge. - You need to break 4 in 3 seconds.

914
00:34:59,946 --> 00:35:02,016
Jong Kook will challenge.

915
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,446
(Come on, bananas.)

916
00:35:03,446 --> 00:35:04,446
You can do it.

917
00:35:05,476 --> 00:35:07,646
(I'll wish for your success.)

918
00:35:08,646 --> 00:35:09,646
(He's glaring.)

919
00:35:11,106 --> 00:35:12,106
Start.

920
00:35:12,246 --> 00:35:13,776
(He starts to split 85 bananas in a minute.)

921
00:35:13,776 --> 00:35:14,976
You're fast. Good.

922
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:16,376
He's doomed.

923
00:35:16,776 --> 00:35:18,546
- No. He's doing well. - He's so fast.

924
00:35:18,646 --> 00:35:20,306
No. Tear them all.

925
00:35:20,546 --> 00:35:22,746
Monkeys will be sad to see this.

926
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:24,806
- Let's blend them later. - He is really fast.

927
00:35:24,806 --> 00:35:25,946
- He is fast. - He can make it.

928
00:35:26,016 --> 00:35:27,376
- He is so quick. - Good job.

929
00:35:27,406 --> 00:35:29,016
- Great. - You can make it.

930
00:35:29,016 --> 00:35:30,646
He may get cramps in her fingers.

931
00:35:30,646 --> 00:35:32,446
If there were 80 of them, it would be possible but...

932
00:35:32,446 --> 00:35:33,516
Well...

933
00:35:33,646 --> 00:35:35,246
- They're slippery. - There are many left.

934
00:35:35,246 --> 00:35:36,246
Did he split 20?

935
00:35:36,546 --> 00:35:39,306
- I think he can do it. - It is possible.

936
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:41,906
- It's because he's Jong Kook. - It's like a circus.

937
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:42,946
He can do it.

938
00:35:42,946 --> 00:35:44,546
30 seconds have passed.

939
00:35:44,546 --> 00:35:45,946
Bravo.

940
00:35:46,706 --> 00:35:49,046
- I think he can finish it. - I think so, too.

941
00:35:49,346 --> 00:35:50,976
- Gosh. - Goodness.

942
00:35:50,976 --> 00:35:53,206
- He looks like a monster. - How can he do this?

943
00:35:53,246 --> 00:35:55,546
- Even monkeys can't do that. - Did you call him a monster?

944
00:35:55,546 --> 00:35:56,876
- He's a machine. - Since he's so good.

945
00:35:57,146 --> 00:35:58,806
- How many seconds have passed? - 40 seconds.

946
00:35:58,806 --> 00:36:00,406
He must be thinking of this as exercise.

947
00:36:01,106 --> 00:36:03,146
(There are only a few left.)

948
00:36:03,906 --> 00:36:04,946
(Cheer up, my avatar.)

949
00:36:05,546 --> 00:36:07,406
- We don't know the result yet. - As time goes on,

950
00:36:07,406 --> 00:36:10,606
- Jong Kook is getting tired. - You can do it.

951
00:36:11,846 --> 00:36:14,076
(For my owner and...)

952
00:36:14,076 --> 00:36:15,406
(to pass the bomb to others...)

953
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:16,446
It's okay.

954
00:36:16,446 --> 00:36:17,706
(It's exciting.)

955
00:36:18,546 --> 00:36:20,046
Jong Kook is getting tired, too.

956
00:36:21,046 --> 00:36:22,876
- Five minutes are left. - Five minutes.

957
00:36:23,146 --> 00:36:25,516
Everyone, get ready to laugh.

958
00:36:25,706 --> 00:36:26,706
It's a failure.

959
00:36:26,706 --> 00:36:28,246
(He fails to split the bananas.)

960
00:36:29,846 --> 00:36:32,046
(They burst into laughter.)

961
00:36:32,046 --> 00:36:33,076
(He can't split the bananas.)

962
00:36:33,076 --> 00:36:35,806
- He is a fool - He is a fool

963
00:36:36,406 --> 00:36:37,806
It's party time.

964
00:36:38,046 --> 00:36:39,576
That was impossible.

965
00:36:39,606 --> 00:36:41,446
This was impossible.

966
00:36:41,806 --> 00:36:46,076
As you went over 40,

967
00:36:46,146 --> 00:36:48,606
- your speed got reduced. - Right.

968
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,876
- It was good exercise. - If Jong Kook failed, we can't...

969
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:54,016
My master will eat those bananas.

970
00:36:54,976 --> 00:36:58,106
I'll challenge to eat 85 of bananas.

971
00:36:58,446 --> 00:36:59,806
You challenge to eat them?

972
00:36:59,806 --> 00:37:00,906
(Kim Joon Hyun's Top 3 Chef King)

973
00:37:01,076 --> 00:37:02,546
(Come here, bananas.)

974
00:37:02,546 --> 00:37:04,646
Let's share the bananas.

975
00:37:04,646 --> 00:37:07,306
- Okay. - With the staff, too.

976
00:37:07,346 --> 00:37:08,576
It's a banana festival.

977
00:37:08,646 --> 00:37:10,406
- It's really a banana festival. - Yes.

978
00:37:10,776 --> 00:37:12,246
Let's share with the staff.

979
00:37:12,746 --> 00:37:15,446
You can't succeed alone.

980
00:37:15,446 --> 00:37:18,646
Unfortunately, Jong Kook's challenge turned out to be a failure.

981
00:37:18,646 --> 00:37:19,776
(Their challenge has failed.)

982
00:37:20,206 --> 00:37:22,146
(It serves you right.)

983
00:37:22,146 --> 00:37:27,776
Because he failed, he has to open one of his bags.

984
00:37:27,876 --> 00:37:29,646
There is a bomb in either on of the bags.

985
00:37:29,746 --> 00:37:32,146
- Pick one. - I'll pick the bag on the right.

986
00:37:32,146 --> 00:37:33,806
- I'll pick the right, too. - Shall we pick this?

987
00:37:33,806 --> 00:37:35,846
- Let's pick this one. - Okay.

988
00:37:36,016 --> 00:37:37,746
(Jong Kook, you're doomed.)

989
00:37:37,746 --> 00:37:38,746
Please open it.

990
00:37:38,976 --> 00:37:41,546
(What will there be in the bag?)

991
00:37:41,876 --> 00:37:44,246
(It should not be a bomb.)

992
00:37:45,046 --> 00:37:46,046
Is it a bomb?

993
00:37:46,976 --> 00:37:48,176
(It's a bomb.)

994
00:37:50,406 --> 00:37:51,446
It's a bomb.

995
00:37:51,446 --> 00:37:53,046
(Location of the bomb is revealed.)

996
00:37:53,046 --> 00:37:55,346
- Wow, bomb. - Bam.

997
00:37:56,176 --> 00:37:58,976
But if Jong Kook comes first place, we're over.

998
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:01,276
- Then we'll be doomed. - Right.

999
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:04,246
We need to block them completely.

1000
00:38:04,246 --> 00:38:06,546
Now, we'll begin the second auction.

1001
00:38:06,546 --> 00:38:08,546
- Okay. - All right.

1002
00:38:08,546 --> 00:38:12,746
This time, the owners will challenge...

1003
00:38:12,746 --> 00:38:16,016
and the avatars will bid.

1004
00:38:16,016 --> 00:38:18,146
I'll let you know the next game.

1005
00:38:18,146 --> 00:38:19,446
It's splitting the wooden chopsticks this time.

1006
00:38:19,446 --> 00:38:20,706
- What? - Did it change?

1007
00:38:20,706 --> 00:38:23,346
The second game is splitting wooden chopsticks.

1008
00:38:23,346 --> 00:38:26,446
I can split it even with my bottom since I'm a comedienne.

1009
00:38:28,046 --> 00:38:31,346
My master can do that, too.

1010
00:38:31,346 --> 00:38:32,516
Can she?

1011
00:38:32,516 --> 00:38:34,176
- Excuse me? - Really?

1012
00:38:34,446 --> 00:38:37,016
You can do that.

1013
00:38:37,016 --> 00:38:39,046
- I can't. - She's upset.

1014
00:38:39,046 --> 00:38:40,276
She is upset.

1015
00:38:40,706 --> 00:38:43,606
My body remembers splitting chopsticks very well.

1016
00:38:43,606 --> 00:38:47,146
The time limit is 1 minute and we'll start from 10.

1017
00:38:47,146 --> 00:38:48,906
- 20. - Let's start the auction.

1018
00:38:48,906 --> 00:38:50,076
- 20. - I'll take 20.

1019
00:38:50,076 --> 00:38:51,706
- 30. - It's 30 now.

1020
00:38:51,706 --> 00:38:52,846
60.

1021
00:38:54,046 --> 00:38:56,276
Hey, you're not supposed to do that.

1022
00:38:56,606 --> 00:38:58,776
- Haven't you bid? - Get out.

1023
00:38:58,776 --> 00:39:00,646
- Hey, Kwang Soo. - You haven't bid, have you?

1024
00:39:01,146 --> 00:39:03,046
You'll be kicked out if you're like that.

1025
00:39:03,046 --> 00:39:04,346
Why are you making the game so hard?

1026
00:39:04,346 --> 00:39:06,106
Don't you think we can do 200?

1027
00:39:06,106 --> 00:39:08,376
- We can do 60. - Look at this, Kwang Soo.

1028
00:39:08,606 --> 00:39:10,546
You said you could do it but why are you silent?

1029
00:39:10,746 --> 00:39:12,976
How long have you been on variety shows?

1030
00:39:13,246 --> 00:39:15,146
Gosh!

1031
00:39:15,146 --> 00:39:17,446
- You deserved that. - Wait.

1032
00:39:17,446 --> 00:39:19,246
Do I have to hear that from a young boy?

1033
00:39:19,246 --> 00:39:21,846
He's been on Running Man for years.

1034
00:39:21,846 --> 00:39:23,976
You just destroyed the foundation of this auction.

1035
00:39:23,976 --> 00:39:26,446
- Right. - Use your head.

1036
00:39:26,446 --> 00:39:27,546
Why do you think we're here?

1037
00:39:27,546 --> 00:39:31,106
To be more careful, let's go up one by one from now.

1038
00:39:31,106 --> 00:39:32,846
- That's how it should be. - One by one.

1039
00:39:32,846 --> 00:39:34,346
Why are you doing this to me, too?

1040
00:39:35,516 --> 00:39:37,746
- I'll bid 53. - I'll take 53.

1041
00:39:37,746 --> 00:39:39,146
- 54. - 54.

1042
00:39:39,146 --> 00:39:40,876
- I'll go with 55. - It 55.

1043
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:43,546
60... No.

1044
00:39:43,546 --> 00:39:45,706
She said to go up one by one.

1045
00:39:45,706 --> 00:39:47,406
So we can't skip numbers?

1046
00:39:47,406 --> 00:39:49,746
Didn't you hear what she said?

1047
00:39:49,746 --> 00:39:51,076
Is he a fool?

1048
00:39:52,346 --> 00:39:53,446
(The prince of Asia became a fool.)

1049
00:39:53,446 --> 00:39:55,446
- It suits him. - You're a fool.

1050
00:39:55,446 --> 00:39:57,106
- What are you talking about? - You're like a fool.

1051
00:39:57,246 --> 00:39:59,976
Fools usually look skinny like him.

1052
00:39:59,976 --> 00:40:01,706
He looks a little bit dumb.

1053
00:40:01,706 --> 00:40:04,776
- Did you say I look dumb? - A fool suits him better.

1054
00:40:04,776 --> 00:40:06,946
- Let's restart. - Let's go.

1055
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:10,176
It's now 55. You can bid 56.

1056
00:40:10,346 --> 00:40:12,806
- Do you want to bid 56? - 56.

1057
00:40:12,876 --> 00:40:14,806
- 56. - Haha bid 56.

1058
00:40:14,806 --> 00:40:16,646
I can do 56.

1059
00:40:17,016 --> 00:40:18,346
It's 56.

1060
00:40:18,846 --> 00:40:21,106
I think they're doing that to raise the number.

1061
00:40:21,276 --> 00:40:22,646
I'll shout the number three times.

1062
00:40:22,646 --> 00:40:23,946
- 56, - Let's finish it.

1063
00:40:23,946 --> 00:40:24,946
- 56. - It's over.

1064
00:40:24,946 --> 00:40:26,706
- It's over. - 57.

1065
00:40:27,546 --> 00:40:29,146
- I was going to bid. - 58.

1066
00:40:29,146 --> 00:40:31,746
Jong Kook bid 58. Is there anyone who want 59?

1067
00:40:31,746 --> 00:40:34,516
Are there more? It's now 58.

1068
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:36,946
- 60! - Hey!

1069
00:40:37,446 --> 00:40:39,146
(He bids 60.)

1070
00:40:39,146 --> 00:40:40,176
Hey, fool.

1071
00:40:40,176 --> 00:40:43,106
- We're going up. - We can't call 60 now.

1072
00:40:43,246 --> 00:40:45,706
I don't understand why I can't call 60.

1073
00:40:45,706 --> 00:40:48,376
- 60 is... - Why not?

1074
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:49,806
60 is a tabooed number.

1075
00:40:49,806 --> 00:40:51,376
Why is it tabooed?

1076
00:40:51,546 --> 00:40:53,676
Hey, fool, I'll give it to you. So just go home.

1077
00:40:53,806 --> 00:40:55,546
- Don't call me a fool. - Go home.

1078
00:40:55,546 --> 00:40:57,146
I can't believe this.

1079
00:40:57,346 --> 00:41:01,646
Kwang Soo bid 60, the highest number.

1080
00:41:01,946 --> 00:41:03,976
Don't you want to try to bid?

1081
00:41:03,976 --> 00:41:06,016
- 64. - He said 64.

1082
00:41:06,346 --> 00:41:07,706
- I'll go with 65. - It's 65.

1083
00:41:07,706 --> 00:41:08,846
- Now, it's 65. - Wait a minute.

1084
00:41:09,546 --> 00:41:10,676
(My master will take 66.)

1085
00:41:10,876 --> 00:41:12,876
My master will take 66.

1086
00:41:12,876 --> 00:41:15,376
- Isn't that too many? - They said 66.

1087
00:41:15,376 --> 00:41:16,876
Isn't Ji Hye shocked?

1088
00:41:16,876 --> 00:41:19,906
Ji Hye will try 66 pairs.

1089
00:41:19,906 --> 00:41:21,476
- Let's have them open the bag. - Okay.

1090
00:41:21,476 --> 00:41:23,576
- Okay. - Let's take a look.

1091
00:41:23,576 --> 00:41:25,446
All right, let's go.

1092
00:41:25,446 --> 00:41:28,046
- Let's go. - If there's no one else,

1093
00:41:28,046 --> 00:41:29,276
we close at 66.

1094
00:41:29,776 --> 00:41:31,846
66? 66?

1095
00:41:31,846 --> 00:41:34,206
It's sold at 66.

1096
00:41:35,346 --> 00:41:36,946
You can do it.

1097
00:41:37,276 --> 00:41:38,406
No, she can't.

1098
00:41:38,576 --> 00:41:41,106
These are harder to grip than bananas.

1099
00:41:41,106 --> 00:41:43,106
How you grip the chopsticks is important.

1100
00:41:43,106 --> 00:41:44,146
Okay.

1101
00:41:44,146 --> 00:41:46,606
It's Ji Hye's chopsticks show.

1102
00:41:46,606 --> 00:41:48,906
- She won't make it. - It seems difficult.

1103
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:50,646
It gets tiring after a while.

1104
00:41:50,646 --> 00:41:54,016
- Jae Seok's final bid was 66. - Right.

1105
00:41:54,016 --> 00:41:58,176
Ji Hye must split 66 pairs of chopsticks to succeed.

1106
00:41:59,046 --> 00:42:00,406
Just concentrate on doing this.

1107
00:42:01,276 --> 00:42:03,476
It gets tiring after a while.

1108
00:42:03,476 --> 00:42:05,276
(Will they win the bag of gold?)

1109
00:42:06,476 --> 00:42:07,706
Please start.

1110
00:42:07,706 --> 00:42:08,906
Start.

1111
00:42:08,906 --> 00:42:10,206
(Separating 66 pairs of chopsticks starts.)

1112
00:42:10,206 --> 00:42:11,246
She's fast.

1113
00:42:12,976 --> 00:42:15,876
- Keep going. - Goodness.

1114
00:42:15,876 --> 00:42:18,146
- Give it to me properly. - Goodness.

1115
00:42:18,176 --> 00:42:20,706
Did you hear what she just said?

1116
00:42:20,876 --> 00:42:23,446
- "Give it to me properly." - What are you doing?

1117
00:42:23,446 --> 00:42:25,946
- Hold the bottom. - What are you doing right now?

1118
00:42:25,946 --> 00:42:29,446
- Hold the bottom of the chopsticks. - Did you hear what she said?

1119
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:31,206
- "What are you doing right now?" - Hurry up.

1120
00:42:31,206 --> 00:42:33,276
- Hurry and give them to me. - Don't hold the top.

1121
00:42:33,276 --> 00:42:36,246
- Split them from the bottom. - Do a better job, Jae Seok.

1122
00:42:36,246 --> 00:42:38,746
- Split them from the bottom. - Goodness.

1123
00:42:38,746 --> 00:42:40,806
(They're growing apart like the separated chopsticks.)

1124
00:42:40,806 --> 00:42:43,906
- Jae Seok needs to do better. - It's okay, don't worry.

1125
00:42:43,906 --> 00:42:45,206
We can do it.

1126
00:42:45,206 --> 00:42:47,146
We can do it.

1127
00:42:47,146 --> 00:42:49,046
- We're quick enough. - Only 30 seconds passed.

1128
00:42:49,046 --> 00:42:50,406
- They might make it. - It's possible.

1129
00:42:50,406 --> 00:42:52,976
Don't worry. We'll make it.

1130
00:42:52,976 --> 00:42:54,576
- 30 seconds remain. - We'll make it.

1131
00:42:54,576 --> 00:42:56,476
I'm absolutely positive.

1132
00:42:56,476 --> 00:42:59,046
- I told you this was possible. - They're almost done.

1133
00:42:59,046 --> 00:43:01,376
We can do it. We can do it.

1134
00:43:01,376 --> 00:43:03,176
We can do it.

1135
00:43:03,276 --> 00:43:04,706
(Will their wish turn into a miracle?)

1136
00:43:04,706 --> 00:43:07,606
- They're almost done. - We can do it.

1137
00:43:07,606 --> 00:43:10,206
(They have less than 10 pairs left.)

1138
00:43:10,406 --> 00:43:12,746
- We can do it. - In 9, 8...

1139
00:43:12,746 --> 00:43:15,546
- We can do it. - In 7, 6, 5...

1140
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:20,976
(What will be the result of this battle?)

1141
00:43:20,976 --> 00:43:23,906
- In 2, 1. - Just a little more.

1142
00:43:24,546 --> 00:43:27,746
(With remaining five pairs, they fail.)

1143
00:43:28,016 --> 00:43:31,546
(They were so close.)

1144
00:43:31,546 --> 00:43:33,776
(Someone's failure makes others happy.)

1145
00:43:33,906 --> 00:43:35,676
I want to see someone succeed.

1146
00:43:36,076 --> 00:43:38,516
Why didn't you hand them to me properly?

1147
00:43:39,076 --> 00:43:41,306
- Ji Hye's mood changed a lot. - I saw that, too.

1148
00:43:41,306 --> 00:43:42,746
She has a short temper.

1149
00:43:42,746 --> 00:43:44,406
(She's very angry.)

1150
00:43:44,406 --> 00:43:46,546
Did you see her do this?

1151
00:43:46,546 --> 00:43:48,406
(Throwing away the chopsticks)

1152
00:43:48,506 --> 00:43:49,576
She did it at the end.

1153
00:43:49,576 --> 00:43:52,576
- In 2, 1. - Just a little more.

1154
00:43:52,576 --> 00:43:54,246
(We're doomed.)

1155
00:43:55,006 --> 00:43:57,076
Gosh, we were so close.

1156
00:43:57,076 --> 00:43:59,606
Let's see what's in their bag.

1157
00:43:59,776 --> 00:44:00,806
(It's time to see inside their bag.)

1158
00:44:01,176 --> 00:44:03,806
- I want to see someone succeed. - This is fun.

1159
00:44:03,906 --> 00:44:05,906
I bet there's something inside one of the bags.

1160
00:44:05,906 --> 00:44:07,546
I think so, too.

1161
00:44:07,546 --> 00:44:09,606
- I think one of them has gold. - I bet there's gold inside.

1162
00:44:09,606 --> 00:44:10,976
Show us the front.

1163
00:44:10,976 --> 00:44:12,446
(He'll open one of the bags.)

1164
00:44:12,446 --> 00:44:14,876
- Jae Seok. - There are some scratches.

1165
00:44:15,106 --> 00:44:16,576
Look at this.

1166
00:44:16,776 --> 00:44:19,806
There are scratches because they changed the stickers.

1167
00:44:19,806 --> 00:44:22,106
The sticker on that bag changed, right?

1168
00:44:22,206 --> 00:44:23,576
- It's this one. - That's the one.

1169
00:44:24,206 --> 00:44:25,346
It's that bag.

1170
00:44:25,976 --> 00:44:29,146
(One of the bags has gold. There must be something inside.)

1171
00:44:32,946 --> 00:44:35,106
(The bag is empty.)

1172
00:44:35,946 --> 00:44:37,076
Goodness.

1173
00:44:37,076 --> 00:44:39,846
There's something inside the bag on the left.

1174
00:44:40,446 --> 00:44:41,506
I'm sure there is something.

1175
00:44:41,506 --> 00:44:44,276
Didn't Jae Seok's team change the bag?

1176
00:44:44,406 --> 00:44:46,946
(He got lucky and avoided opening his bag with gold.)

1177
00:44:46,946 --> 00:44:49,906
This is today's last auction.

1178
00:44:49,946 --> 00:44:52,476
This auction is a game category...

1179
00:44:52,476 --> 00:44:54,246
which the master and his avatar...

1180
00:44:54,306 --> 00:44:55,906
- play together. - Come on.

1181
00:44:55,906 --> 00:44:58,846
- Let's do it. - It's "Couple Jump Ropes".

1182
00:44:59,076 --> 00:45:01,346
It's "Couple Jump Ropes".

1183
00:45:01,346 --> 00:45:03,376
We did this often when we were young.

1184
00:45:03,376 --> 00:45:04,676
How will it turn out?

1185
00:45:04,806 --> 00:45:07,206
- You should try it once. - Shall we give it a try?

1186
00:45:07,846 --> 00:45:09,246
I bet Min Ho is good at it.

1187
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:11,006
Get ready, start.

1188
00:45:11,046 --> 00:45:13,306
(Min Ho and Gary try jumping the rope.)

1189
00:45:14,746 --> 00:45:16,176
- They'll make it. - This is possible.

1190
00:45:16,176 --> 00:45:19,506
(Their movement is swift like a butterfly.)

1191
00:45:19,506 --> 00:45:22,606
(Despite their drastically different looks, they have good chemistry.)

1192
00:45:22,606 --> 00:45:24,906
- In 1, 2, 3, 4. - Do it as if you're doing it alone.

1193
00:45:25,046 --> 00:45:27,946
- Look at them. - In 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

1194
00:45:28,446 --> 00:45:29,646
They're good.

1195
00:45:30,076 --> 00:45:31,376
Gosh.

1196
00:45:32,046 --> 00:45:33,976
Min Ho's team can do it.

1197
00:45:33,976 --> 00:45:36,476
(Let's show them what we can do.)

1198
00:45:37,876 --> 00:45:40,276
- They're good, too. - 13, 14, 15...

1199
00:45:40,276 --> 00:45:42,106
16, 17, 18.

1200
00:45:43,206 --> 00:45:44,606
Why did you trip?

1201
00:45:44,606 --> 00:45:46,606
(Why did you trip?)

1202
00:45:47,576 --> 00:45:49,176
He should have done better.

1203
00:45:49,846 --> 00:45:51,376
She complains a lot.

1204
00:45:51,376 --> 00:45:54,376
There's something wrong with her personality.

1205
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:55,946
My master is...

1206
00:45:55,946 --> 00:45:57,606
- a little... - She's somewhat upset.

1207
00:45:57,606 --> 00:45:58,776
She's upset.

1208
00:45:58,776 --> 00:46:01,476
You had enough time to practise.

1209
00:46:01,476 --> 00:46:04,146
Now, we'll start the auction.

1210
00:46:04,146 --> 00:46:05,606
We start at three.

1211
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:07,706
Let's start at three.

1212
00:46:08,206 --> 00:46:10,706
- Four. - Seok Jin called four.

1213
00:46:10,706 --> 00:46:12,746
- Six. - Haha called five.

1214
00:46:12,746 --> 00:46:14,246
Ji Hyo called six.

1215
00:46:14,246 --> 00:46:15,246
Nine.

1216
00:46:15,446 --> 00:46:17,276
- Haha called nine. - It's dangerous.

1217
00:46:17,276 --> 00:46:19,146
- We can do 9, can't we? - 11.

1218
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,006
- 12. - We have 12.

1219
00:46:21,006 --> 00:46:22,506
- 13. - We have 13.

1220
00:46:22,506 --> 00:46:23,806
- 14. - 14?

1221
00:46:23,946 --> 00:46:25,206
I say 20.

1222
00:46:25,206 --> 00:46:27,406
- 20? Okay, I accept. - 30.

1223
00:46:27,406 --> 00:46:29,176
- The highest bid currently is 30. - Let's call 30.

1224
00:46:29,306 --> 00:46:31,976
I'm warning you, but we won't give up this game.

1225
00:46:31,976 --> 00:46:34,076
We'll play it no matter what.

1226
00:46:34,076 --> 00:46:35,606
During the simulation...

1227
00:46:37,176 --> 00:46:39,306
- You seem nervous. - I'm sorry. Let's take a break.

1228
00:46:39,346 --> 00:46:41,946
- He's already nervous. - Pardon me.

1229
00:46:42,306 --> 00:46:44,606
Seok Jin, you seem quite nervous.

1230
00:46:44,606 --> 00:46:48,676
During the simulation, we jumped the rope 18 times.

1231
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:51,006
- 41. - Min Ho should try.

1232
00:46:51,006 --> 00:46:53,246
- 41. - We have 41.

1233
00:46:53,346 --> 00:46:55,276
- Min Ho will try no matter what. - What should we do?

1234
00:46:55,606 --> 00:46:57,476
He should give it a try.

1235
00:46:57,506 --> 00:46:59,346
- Se Chan? - 42.

1236
00:46:59,346 --> 00:47:01,806
We have 42. Will you try 43, Min Ho?

1237
00:47:01,806 --> 00:47:03,506
- Will you try 43? - 43.

1238
00:47:03,506 --> 00:47:05,306
- 43. - I accept 43.

1239
00:47:05,306 --> 00:47:06,846
43 is the highest bid.

1240
00:47:06,846 --> 00:47:08,446
(Please stop Min Ho for me.)

1241
00:47:08,506 --> 00:47:10,106
Min Ho will try no matter what.

1242
00:47:10,106 --> 00:47:12,676
I think it's a competition of these two teams.

1243
00:47:13,046 --> 00:47:16,506
Ji Seok's team is trying for fun, but Min Ho's team is likely to win.

1244
00:47:16,506 --> 00:47:19,306
My heart is pounding because I'm so nervous.

1245
00:47:19,876 --> 00:47:22,106
Here's our final decision.

1246
00:47:22,946 --> 00:47:24,006
I call 50.

1247
00:47:24,006 --> 00:47:25,446
I call 50.

1248
00:47:26,046 --> 00:47:27,376
- 50? - Yes.

1249
00:47:27,376 --> 00:47:29,676
Is 50 the last call?

1250
00:47:29,676 --> 00:47:31,846
- I think Min Ho will do it. - Is it 50?

1251
00:47:31,846 --> 00:47:32,906
- Is Min Ho not going for it? - Min Ho should give it a try.

1252
00:47:32,906 --> 00:47:35,276
This is your last chance. Is the final call 50?

1253
00:47:36,946 --> 00:47:39,206
(You're going for it, right?)

1254
00:47:39,946 --> 00:47:43,246
(What will be Min Ho's move?)

1255
00:47:43,776 --> 00:47:46,046
It's sold at 50.

1256
00:47:46,076 --> 00:47:48,276
(Se Chan and Seok Jin have to try 50 jumps together.)

1257
00:47:48,276 --> 00:47:49,776
- Wait. - Min Ho.

1258
00:47:49,776 --> 00:47:51,506
- Min Ho won't do it? - Why not?

1259
00:47:51,506 --> 00:47:53,006
You've done boxing before.

1260
00:47:53,646 --> 00:47:55,306
It's been 10 years since I've done boxing.

1261
00:47:55,306 --> 00:47:57,076
He has a bad knee.

1262
00:47:57,946 --> 00:48:00,206
How can he jump 50 times with his knee?

1263
00:48:00,306 --> 00:48:01,906
It'd be hilarious if he trips on the first jump.

1264
00:48:01,906 --> 00:48:02,976
That would be amazing.

1265
00:48:03,406 --> 00:48:04,846
- Can you leave glasses on? - They get in the way.

1266
00:48:04,846 --> 00:48:06,876
- You look ugly without them. - They get in the way.

1267
00:48:09,876 --> 00:48:11,706
(He trips immediately.)

1268
00:48:11,706 --> 00:48:14,046
Stop it, please.

1269
00:48:14,276 --> 00:48:16,446
He should be able to jump at least once by himself.

1270
00:48:16,446 --> 00:48:17,946
My goodness.

1271
00:48:18,006 --> 00:48:20,306
How can they jump 50 when he can't jump 5 times?

1272
00:48:20,306 --> 00:48:22,246
Let's try it without the rope.

1273
00:48:22,246 --> 00:48:23,446
Let's practise.

1274
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:28,876
(Not in sync)

1275
00:48:28,946 --> 00:48:31,346
- What was that? - Were they on a seesaw?

1276
00:48:31,346 --> 00:48:33,646
I thought they were on a seesaw.

1277
00:48:33,746 --> 00:48:36,146
- I thought so, too. - Let's make an eye contact.

1278
00:48:36,146 --> 00:48:37,776
(Their practice time is up.)

1279
00:48:37,776 --> 00:48:39,346
Stay with my pace.

1280
00:48:39,406 --> 00:48:42,146
It'd be hilarious if they trip on their second jump.

1281
00:48:42,146 --> 00:48:43,746
I'm sorry, Ma'am,

1282
00:48:43,776 --> 00:48:45,506
but may we start when we're ready?

1283
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:46,606
Of course.

1284
00:48:46,606 --> 00:48:49,846
- Why would you apologise? - Why is that important?

1285
00:48:49,846 --> 00:48:52,006
- We'll start ourselves. - I'm not used to being called.

1286
00:48:52,006 --> 00:48:53,576
- Please count our jumps. - Okay.

1287
00:48:54,606 --> 00:48:56,576
- You can do it. - We can do it.

1288
00:48:56,576 --> 00:48:58,346
Let's do it.

1289
00:48:58,506 --> 00:49:00,206
Who's the master?

1290
00:49:00,206 --> 00:49:01,376
- We can do it. - We can do it.

1291
00:49:01,376 --> 00:49:03,446
- Let's do it. - We can do it.

1292
00:49:03,446 --> 00:49:07,746
(Master...)

1293
00:49:07,746 --> 00:49:10,646
(Avatar...)

1294
00:49:10,946 --> 00:49:15,346
(We can do it.)

1295
00:49:16,006 --> 00:49:17,746
It's like "Dad's Challenge".

1296
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:20,876
Are you naming this?

1297
00:49:20,876 --> 00:49:22,246
"Dad's Challenge"?

1298
00:49:22,246 --> 00:49:24,106
- You can do it, Dad. - Go, Dad.

1299
00:49:24,906 --> 00:49:26,646
- Let's go. - Let's start.

1300
00:49:26,646 --> 00:49:27,846
I bet they'll make three jumps.

1301
00:49:27,846 --> 00:49:29,446
(How funny will they be?)

1302
00:49:30,806 --> 00:49:33,376
- It's making me nervous. - Let's give it a try now.

1303
00:49:33,376 --> 00:49:35,046
(Let's give it a serious try.)

1304
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:38,046
- We can do it. - Let's do it.

1305
00:49:38,106 --> 00:49:40,176
(A golden opportunity to earn the bag of gold.)

1306
00:49:41,346 --> 00:49:44,206
- Let's start. Get ready. - Let's go.

1307
00:49:44,206 --> 00:49:46,676
(They start their "Couple Jump Ropes".)

1308
00:49:49,046 --> 00:49:50,906
Two, three, four...

1309
00:49:51,376 --> 00:49:53,646
- Six, seven. - No one predicted correctly.

1310
00:49:54,076 --> 00:49:55,406
(They jump in sync.)

1311
00:49:55,406 --> 00:49:56,846
- What's going on? - 10.

1312
00:49:56,846 --> 00:49:58,406
(Goodness)

1313
00:49:58,406 --> 00:50:00,546
Don't push me down too much.

1314
00:50:00,546 --> 00:50:02,406
(Everyone is in a daze.)

1315
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:05,576
Don't push me down.

1316
00:50:06,176 --> 00:50:07,906
Don't push me down.

1317
00:50:07,906 --> 00:50:10,346
- Don't push me down. - 17, 18.

1318
00:50:10,606 --> 00:50:11,906
(He tripped.)

1319
00:50:13,976 --> 00:50:15,506
(Screaming)

1320
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:18,476
- They jumped many times. - It was your fault.

1321
00:50:18,476 --> 00:50:20,576
You pushed me down too much.

1322
00:50:21,106 --> 00:50:23,206
Se Chan tripped on the rope,

1323
00:50:23,206 --> 00:50:24,776
but Seok Jin pushed him down.

1324
00:50:24,776 --> 00:50:27,276
- Really? - Se Chan couldn't jump.

1325
00:50:27,276 --> 00:50:29,076
- They're quite good. - You should have resisted.

1326
00:50:29,506 --> 00:50:31,746
Are you kidding me?

1327
00:50:32,076 --> 00:50:33,576
Let's see what's in their bag.

1328
00:50:33,576 --> 00:50:34,946
Which one shall I open?

1329
00:50:34,946 --> 00:50:37,976
They might have a bomb in one of the bags.

1330
00:50:37,976 --> 00:50:39,746
We should have succeeded.

1331
00:50:39,946 --> 00:50:41,576
- This bag. - This one?

1332
00:50:42,346 --> 00:50:43,806
- Do they have something in the bag? - I don't think so.

1333
00:50:44,476 --> 00:50:45,946
I bet they have a bomb.

1334
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:47,306
Let's see.

1335
00:50:47,346 --> 00:50:48,846
If not, it's in Kwang Soo's.

1336
00:50:49,076 --> 00:50:50,206
Here you go.

1337
00:50:50,206 --> 00:50:51,906
- There's nothing inside. - Okay.

1338
00:50:51,976 --> 00:50:53,446
Good job in hiding it.

1339
00:50:53,446 --> 00:50:55,606
- He sounds so strange. - I know.

1340
00:50:55,806 --> 00:50:58,446
- What he said sounds so fake. - Kwang Soo is good at guessing.

1341
00:50:58,876 --> 00:51:00,376
I'm quite observant.

1342
00:51:00,376 --> 00:51:03,376
I keep imagining Kwang Soo with his nose running.

1343
00:51:03,376 --> 00:51:05,646
What are you talking about?

1344
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:07,306
That's so funny.

1345
00:51:07,306 --> 00:51:11,976
All right. The auction for "My Avatar Can" is over.

1346
00:51:12,106 --> 00:51:14,506
- That was fun. - I wish you luck.

1347
00:51:14,506 --> 00:51:17,006
- See you next time. - Thank you.

1348
00:51:17,246 --> 00:51:19,106
Can we do that again?

1349
00:51:19,106 --> 00:51:21,706
- That was so fun. - I want to do that again.

1350
00:51:22,946 --> 00:51:24,576
(2 hours later)

1351
00:51:24,576 --> 00:51:27,606
- We will now begin the death match. - This is making me nervous.

1352
00:51:27,706 --> 00:51:30,346
(They'll fight over the bomb in a game of wits.)

1353
00:51:30,346 --> 00:51:31,376
Get yourself together.

1354
00:51:31,376 --> 00:51:32,806
(There are twists after twists.)

1355
00:51:32,806 --> 00:51:34,406
Is there another twist?

1356
00:51:34,406 --> 00:51:37,406
(How will this cruel race of masters and avatars end?)

1357
00:51:38,106 --> 00:51:40,306
(2 hours ago)

1358
00:51:40,846 --> 00:51:43,976
This round is called, "Find the Right Card".

1359
00:51:44,176 --> 00:51:48,576
Avatars have to make their way through the obstacles of the track.

1360
00:51:48,706 --> 00:51:52,876
Before the match starts, the masters will play a game to win cards.

1361
00:51:53,006 --> 00:51:56,406
They can remove the obstacles according to the cards they win.

1362
00:51:57,076 --> 00:51:59,946
The difficulty of the race...

1363
00:51:59,946 --> 00:52:02,876
depends on how many cards the masters gain.

1364
00:52:03,506 --> 00:52:06,846
If the avatar comes in first place,

1365
00:52:06,846 --> 00:52:09,006
the team is given the opportunity to exchange bags.

1366
00:52:10,206 --> 00:52:11,546
Some of the cards are misspelled.

1367
00:52:12,176 --> 00:52:13,846
- What? - Some are misspelled.

1368
00:52:13,846 --> 00:52:15,606
(They need to look for cards that are typed correctly.)

1369
00:52:15,606 --> 00:52:16,606
I see.

1370
00:52:16,606 --> 00:52:17,876
If you get a card that reads, "Hurdles",

1371
00:52:17,876 --> 00:52:19,776
they'll remove it from the race.

1372
00:52:20,276 --> 00:52:21,846
(What?)

1373
00:52:22,646 --> 00:52:23,976
My master...

1374
00:52:24,346 --> 00:52:26,276
gets upset easily, but she's really slow.

1375
00:52:26,746 --> 00:52:28,546
Does she have any good traits?

1376
00:52:28,846 --> 00:52:30,876
She said she was worried.

1377
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:35,076
"Don't you think I'm coming off too strong?"

1378
00:52:35,276 --> 00:52:37,476
"How do you think I should behave?"

1379
00:52:37,576 --> 00:52:38,646
She's like a little girl.

1380
00:52:38,646 --> 00:52:40,706
I think it's too late for a change.

1381
00:52:40,706 --> 00:52:41,876
It's too late now.

1382
00:52:42,176 --> 00:52:43,406
So I said,

1383
00:52:43,406 --> 00:52:44,406
"It's too late today."

1384
00:52:45,206 --> 00:52:47,306
- It's too late to go back now. - Was she that bad?

1385
00:52:47,306 --> 00:52:48,746
You should try again next time.

1386
00:52:48,746 --> 00:52:51,146
She said she's usually not like this.

1387
00:52:51,146 --> 00:52:53,406
I could sense anger from her face.

1388
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:55,746
She's a nice person, but she has a personality disorder.

1389
00:52:55,746 --> 00:52:57,706
- At least she's nice. - That's right.

1390
00:52:58,376 --> 00:52:59,946
She's a nice person.

1391
00:53:00,506 --> 00:53:02,576
(They put on sticky pants to get the cards.)

1392
00:53:02,576 --> 00:53:04,706
You should take those pants home when you go home.

1393
00:53:04,706 --> 00:53:06,706
- You look good. - He does.

1394
00:53:06,706 --> 00:53:08,306
Are you from Anyang?

1395
00:53:08,306 --> 00:53:10,206
Don't I look like a gangster?

1396
00:53:10,206 --> 00:53:11,376
You do.

1397
00:53:11,376 --> 00:53:12,946
- Look at that. - Are you...

1398
00:53:13,506 --> 00:53:14,646
Are you a gangster from Anyang?

1399
00:53:15,506 --> 00:53:16,606
Let's go, Master!

1400
00:53:17,306 --> 00:53:20,506
I have faith in you, Ji Hyo. I want a path of flowers!

1401
00:53:20,506 --> 00:53:23,246
(I'm counting on you to give me a path of flowers.)

1402
00:53:23,246 --> 00:53:24,946
You can count on me.

1403
00:53:27,246 --> 00:53:28,376
Look at all the cards.

1404
00:53:28,376 --> 00:53:30,606
You have to get the correct one.

1405
00:53:30,606 --> 00:53:31,806
I see it.

1406
00:53:31,906 --> 00:53:33,346
I see one.

1407
00:53:33,806 --> 00:53:35,076
I see it there.

1408
00:53:35,276 --> 00:53:36,406
What's that one?

1409
00:53:36,406 --> 00:53:38,406
Hey, Ji Hye.

1410
00:53:39,246 --> 00:53:40,906
(What am I supposed to be doing again?)

1411
00:53:41,206 --> 00:53:42,476
You have to get the correct ones.

1412
00:53:42,846 --> 00:53:44,546
(You can count on me, Kwang Soo.)

1413
00:53:45,246 --> 00:53:47,276
- I want a path of flowers. - Did you see that?

1414
00:53:47,946 --> 00:53:49,146
- I see hurdles. - There are lots.

1415
00:53:49,146 --> 00:53:51,406
- You have to think fast. - Get the pressure board.

1416
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:53,306
- You can go now. - Let's go.

1417
00:53:53,306 --> 00:53:54,306
("Find the Right Card" begins.)

1418
00:53:56,146 --> 00:53:58,046
(It's a dance-off.)

1419
00:53:58,046 --> 00:53:59,346
What's that dance?

1420
00:53:59,346 --> 00:54:02,776
Min Ho can dance to this.

1421
00:54:02,776 --> 00:54:04,906
Look at Min Ho.

1422
00:54:05,176 --> 00:54:07,876
Look at him go.

1423
00:54:08,846 --> 00:54:10,776
Se Chan, copy Min Ho's dance.

1424
00:54:11,006 --> 00:54:12,846
(I can do that, too.)

1425
00:54:12,846 --> 00:54:13,976
That's good, Min Ho.

1426
00:54:14,346 --> 00:54:16,876
- I wish I could dance like that. - He looks so cool.

1427
00:54:17,476 --> 00:54:20,376
- He's good. - Nice, Min Ho.

1428
00:54:20,376 --> 00:54:21,976
Why aren't you dancing, Master?

1429
00:54:21,976 --> 00:54:23,606
- Acupressure plates. - Acupressure plates.

1430
00:54:23,606 --> 00:54:25,306
(The first word is "acupressure plates".)

1431
00:54:25,306 --> 00:54:27,506
(I got this.)

1432
00:54:27,506 --> 00:54:29,146
Push them over.

1433
00:54:29,146 --> 00:54:31,176
(He comes charging in.)

1434
00:54:31,176 --> 00:54:32,176
There you go.

1435
00:54:32,376 --> 00:54:33,546
(She gets pushed aside.)

1436
00:54:34,846 --> 00:54:37,406
(Looks like Min Ho found something in the middle of the chaos.)

1437
00:54:37,406 --> 00:54:39,176
- Way to go, Ji Hye. - Ji Hyo!

1438
00:54:39,206 --> 00:54:40,706
(Ji Hye is good at everything.)

1439
00:54:41,706 --> 00:54:43,276
- Ji Hyo! - It's over here.

1440
00:54:44,146 --> 00:54:46,546
- It's over here. - That's not the right one.

1441
00:54:46,546 --> 00:54:48,146
We got it.

1442
00:54:48,506 --> 00:54:50,646
It's over there, Se Chan. She has it.

1443
00:54:50,906 --> 00:54:52,946
- Do Yeon has it. - I got it.

1444
00:54:52,946 --> 00:54:54,946
- Push them away. - It's on Do Yeon's bottom.

1445
00:54:54,946 --> 00:54:56,406
- It's on her bottom. - Get up.

1446
00:54:57,246 --> 00:54:58,646
(Ji Hye doesn't give up easily.)

1447
00:54:58,646 --> 00:54:59,906
Way to go, Ji Hye.

1448
00:54:59,906 --> 00:55:02,646
- Ji Hyo! - You're doing well, Ji Hye.

1449
00:55:02,946 --> 00:55:04,106
- Ji Hyo! - It's over here!

1450
00:55:04,106 --> 00:55:05,806
(It's right in front of Ji Hye.)

1451
00:55:06,306 --> 00:55:07,576
(Ji Hyo comes charging in.)

1452
00:55:07,946 --> 00:55:09,546
(Good job, Ji Hyo.)

1453
00:55:09,546 --> 00:55:10,546
- We did it! - That's not the right one.

1454
00:55:10,546 --> 00:55:11,876
- We did it! - Where did it go?

1455
00:55:12,076 --> 00:55:13,576
- Where is it? - Take the card off now.

1456
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:14,776
(Ji Hyo's team no longer has acupressure plates.)

1457
00:55:14,776 --> 00:55:17,306
(This one isn't spelled correctly.)

1458
00:55:17,806 --> 00:55:19,676
(So close, yet so far.)

1459
00:55:19,676 --> 00:55:20,946
- Gosh. - Okay!

1460
00:55:20,946 --> 00:55:23,076
(That's right, isn't it?)

1461
00:55:23,076 --> 00:55:24,246
It's wrong?

1462
00:55:25,076 --> 00:55:26,276
Min Ho.

1463
00:55:26,606 --> 00:55:28,646
(Get it together, Master.)

1464
00:55:30,106 --> 00:55:31,406
I think there's one more.

1465
00:55:31,406 --> 00:55:33,476
There were two cards.

1466
00:55:33,476 --> 00:55:34,546
(Min Ho gets one as well.)

1467
00:55:36,546 --> 00:55:37,806
You got one, too?

1468
00:55:37,806 --> 00:55:39,306
- Are you serious? - This is turning out nicely.

1469
00:55:39,506 --> 00:55:40,946
Is there one more, then?

1470
00:55:41,406 --> 00:55:43,006
- It's over? - It's done?

1471
00:55:43,276 --> 00:55:44,446
Who got it?

1472
00:55:44,446 --> 00:55:46,306
Master, it's over.

1473
00:55:47,346 --> 00:55:48,376
Get up, Master.

1474
00:55:48,376 --> 00:55:49,646
(She's disappointed.)

1475
00:55:50,406 --> 00:55:51,776
I couldn't find it.

1476
00:55:52,376 --> 00:55:54,176
My master is...

1477
00:55:54,546 --> 00:55:57,546
always driven, but she's so bad at games.

1478
00:55:57,546 --> 00:55:59,476
- She didn't win anything today. - Right.

1479
00:55:59,876 --> 00:56:02,276
If you have anger issues, you won't be able to find it.

1480
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:04,546
It's not like we're the ones going on the race.

1481
00:56:04,876 --> 00:56:06,506
We're doing this for the avatars, right?

1482
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:09,676
Can I choose not to do this if I want obstacles for him?

1483
00:56:10,106 --> 00:56:11,176
Is that how it is?

1484
00:56:11,176 --> 00:56:12,476
(What's she on about this time?)

1485
00:56:12,876 --> 00:56:15,246
Master, you're so slow at the start.

1486
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:16,276
I'm sorry.

1487
00:56:16,276 --> 00:56:17,546
Get your head in the game.

1488
00:56:18,006 --> 00:56:20,806
- I'm sorry. - You were just standing there.

1489
00:56:20,806 --> 00:56:21,846
I'll try harder.

1490
00:56:21,846 --> 00:56:23,706
- This is your last chance. - Okay.

1491
00:56:23,706 --> 00:56:25,606
- Stop disappointing me. - I'm sorry.

1492
00:56:25,606 --> 00:56:26,946
(Haha teases his kind master.)

1493
00:56:27,176 --> 00:56:29,176
(Who is the master here?)

1494
00:56:29,646 --> 00:56:31,946
- I'm counting on you, Master. - Let's go, Ji Hyo.

1495
00:56:31,946 --> 00:56:34,276
- Let's do this. - Yes, let's go.

1496
00:56:34,276 --> 00:56:36,046
I don't see anything that says "Puddles".

1497
00:56:36,046 --> 00:56:37,646
I don't wants puddles.

1498
00:56:38,706 --> 00:56:41,946
(The second round starts.)

1499
00:56:43,976 --> 00:56:44,976
How many are in your group?

1500
00:56:44,976 --> 00:56:46,006
It's just me and him.

1501
00:56:46,306 --> 00:56:48,376
- Are you a party of three? - Yes.

1502
00:56:48,676 --> 00:56:49,706
I live alone.

1503
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:50,776
- Who does? - I do.

1504
00:56:50,776 --> 00:56:52,076
Oh, really? I'll pass.

1505
00:56:52,106 --> 00:56:55,676
Fruit plate for table three, please.

1506
00:56:56,076 --> 00:56:57,406
(This is Running Nightclub.)

1507
00:56:57,406 --> 00:56:59,506
- I have to ask you to leave. - "Plunger".

1508
00:56:59,876 --> 00:57:01,006
- What? - Plunger?

1509
00:57:01,006 --> 00:57:02,076
Plunger.

1510
00:57:02,076 --> 00:57:03,776
(They're sprinting for it.)

1511
00:57:03,776 --> 00:57:05,376
Coming through.

1512
00:57:05,376 --> 00:57:06,876
- Master! - Coming through.

1513
00:57:07,846 --> 00:57:09,746
- What are you doing, Ji Hyo? - We can sit out on this one.

1514
00:57:10,576 --> 00:57:11,776
But it's a plunger!

1515
00:57:11,776 --> 00:57:14,046
So what?

1516
00:57:14,046 --> 00:57:15,646
Don't you want to win the race?

1517
00:57:16,706 --> 00:57:19,006
Get away from me, all of you.

1518
00:57:20,006 --> 00:57:22,176
I got it.

1519
00:57:22,306 --> 00:57:23,606
Remove the unnecessary ones.

1520
00:57:24,106 --> 00:57:25,776
Get away from me.

1521
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:28,546
- What's the word again? - Throw away the other ones.

1522
00:57:28,546 --> 00:57:30,676
(Se Chan misses it when it's right in front of him.)

1523
00:57:30,676 --> 00:57:33,046
- Plunger? - That's not the right one.

1524
00:57:33,046 --> 00:57:35,106
- Let's see here. - We have to win this race.

1525
00:57:35,106 --> 00:57:36,646
(It's right here.)

1526
00:57:37,276 --> 00:57:38,846
- It's over there! - There it is.

1527
00:57:39,406 --> 00:57:40,876
(It's over there, Master.)

1528
00:57:40,876 --> 00:57:43,446
- Hey, Ji Hye. - It's over there.

1529
00:57:44,006 --> 00:57:46,776
(He eats the card with his legs.)

1530
00:57:47,346 --> 00:57:49,706
(They reach between his legs.)

1531
00:57:50,306 --> 00:57:52,146
Where are you touching?

1532
00:57:53,206 --> 00:57:55,046
- Where is it? - Get that.

1533
00:57:55,446 --> 00:57:57,406
(Meanwhile,)

1534
00:57:57,406 --> 00:58:00,406
(Ji Hye is confused with the misspelled word.)

1535
00:58:00,846 --> 00:58:02,146
(This is right, isn't it?)

1536
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:03,846
That's not it. That's not the one, Ji Hye.

1537
00:58:03,846 --> 00:58:05,476
It's obviously wrong. Why is she confused?

1538
00:58:06,946 --> 00:58:08,376
- Come on, Ji Hye. - Move over.

1539
00:58:08,546 --> 00:58:09,976
Go away.

1540
00:58:10,346 --> 00:58:11,406
There you go.

1541
00:58:12,376 --> 00:58:15,046
(He's done it again.)

1542
00:58:15,046 --> 00:58:16,446
He got it again.

1543
00:58:16,446 --> 00:58:18,276
He found another one.

1544
00:58:19,146 --> 00:58:21,946
(I want the best things for Gary.)

1545
00:58:21,946 --> 00:58:26,446
(Min Ho and Gary have removed plungers from their race.)

1546
00:58:27,006 --> 00:58:28,176
Good job, Master.

1547
00:58:28,176 --> 00:58:30,546
(His master is on fire.)

1548
00:58:30,546 --> 00:58:31,746
Look at him.

1549
00:58:31,976 --> 00:58:33,876
(I want to do well, too.)

1550
00:58:33,876 --> 00:58:34,976
Ji Hye, it's right over there.

1551
00:58:36,106 --> 00:58:37,506
Move over.

1552
00:58:37,506 --> 00:58:39,146
Go away.

1553
00:58:39,146 --> 00:58:40,306
There you go.

1554
00:58:40,776 --> 00:58:43,046
- Why is she confused? - There you go. You got it.

1555
00:58:43,046 --> 00:58:44,406
- I got it. - Good job.

1556
00:58:44,406 --> 00:58:46,976
(Did Joon Hyun get the right card?)

1557
00:58:46,976 --> 00:58:48,546
- Where did it go? - Good job, Master.

1558
00:58:48,846 --> 00:58:50,646
Okay!

1559
00:58:50,646 --> 00:58:52,946
(Joon Hyun and Haha have removed plungers from their race, too.)

1560
00:58:53,676 --> 00:58:54,806
What was the word again?

1561
00:58:55,346 --> 00:58:57,146
What on earth are you doing, Ji Hye?

1562
00:58:58,346 --> 00:59:00,206
- Can't you read? - Get it on your pants.

1563
00:59:00,476 --> 00:59:01,976
- Is this right? - Yes.

1564
00:59:01,976 --> 00:59:03,946
- She got it. - You did it!

1565
00:59:03,946 --> 00:59:05,406
- Wait a minute. - You did it, Ji Hye.

1566
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:08,176
- I thought this one was wrong. - We did it.

1567
00:59:08,346 --> 00:59:09,346
(It's missing a letter.)

1568
00:59:09,346 --> 00:59:10,406
It's not right?

1569
00:59:11,006 --> 00:59:12,046
It's misspelled.

1570
00:59:12,106 --> 00:59:13,606
- Oh, really? - No, this is right.

1571
00:59:13,606 --> 00:59:16,476
- It's incorrect. - No, this is right.

1572
00:59:16,906 --> 00:59:18,876
- Ji Hye says it's right. - It's missing a letter.

1573
00:59:19,376 --> 00:59:20,876
How can you get that wrong?

1574
00:59:20,876 --> 00:59:24,106
She got confused with the most obvious one, too.

1575
00:59:24,206 --> 00:59:25,946
I was confused.

1576
00:59:25,946 --> 00:59:27,446
What's that on your legs?

1577
00:59:28,646 --> 00:59:29,776
(She's collecting incorrect cards.)

1578
00:59:29,776 --> 00:59:32,406
- What are they doing there? - She's hilarious.

1579
00:59:33,576 --> 00:59:34,576
(She slaps the cards down.)

1580
00:59:34,576 --> 00:59:37,406
(She got everything else except for the right card.)

1581
00:59:37,406 --> 00:59:39,206
- Ji Hye. - I told you it was wrong.

1582
00:59:39,206 --> 00:59:41,046
- Ji Hye is... - I told you.

1583
00:59:41,106 --> 00:59:42,946
Ji Hye is about to lose it.

1584
00:59:43,846 --> 00:59:45,346
Take it easy, Ji Hye.

1585
00:59:48,276 --> 00:59:49,406
We have to do better than this, Ji Hyo.

1586
00:59:50,276 --> 00:59:51,676
We need to exchange the bags with gold ones.

1587
00:59:52,306 --> 00:59:53,376
(Come on, Master.)

1588
00:59:53,376 --> 00:59:54,506
We need to get our gold.

1589
00:59:55,176 --> 00:59:56,776
What? I was just...

1590
00:59:56,946 --> 00:59:59,046
We have to win the race, right?

1591
00:59:59,046 --> 01:00:00,406
I'm just saying, you know?

1592
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:03,906
Why are you like this? We have to win this game.

1593
01:00:04,406 --> 01:00:07,046
- What's the last one? - Puddles.

1594
01:00:07,276 --> 01:00:08,846
- What? - Puddles.

1595
01:00:09,076 --> 01:00:10,676
Is it "puddles" or "poodles"?

1596
01:00:10,676 --> 01:00:12,246
- "Puddles". - Okay.

1597
01:00:12,246 --> 01:00:14,646
- There it is. - That one is misspelled.

1598
01:00:14,646 --> 01:00:17,346
(She has her own way of doing things.)

1599
01:00:18,146 --> 01:00:19,376
Come here, Ji Hye.

1600
01:00:20,306 --> 01:00:21,376
Come here.

1601
01:00:21,876 --> 01:00:23,876
(Master, I found the right card.)

1602
01:00:24,546 --> 01:00:26,106
(Got it.)

1603
01:00:26,946 --> 01:00:28,606
Isn't that cheating?

1604
01:00:29,146 --> 01:00:30,606
(The third round starts.)

1605
01:00:30,606 --> 01:00:33,106
(This is their last chance.)

1606
01:00:34,206 --> 01:00:38,446
(Only 1 obstacle remains.)

1607
01:00:39,076 --> 01:00:40,346
(They dance vigorously.)

1608
01:00:40,346 --> 01:00:41,446
You can't mess this one up.

1609
01:00:41,806 --> 01:00:45,906
(Let's remove some obstacles.)

1610
01:00:46,406 --> 01:00:47,976
Let's go, Joon Hyun!

1611
01:00:48,406 --> 01:00:50,146
- Puddles. - You have to do this one!

1612
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,206
You must get this.

1613
01:00:51,206 --> 01:00:52,746
- You have to do this one! - You have to get this one.

1614
01:00:52,746 --> 01:00:54,006
- You have to do this! - Please!

1615
01:00:54,206 --> 01:00:57,446
(I don't want to get wet in this cold weather.)

1616
01:00:58,176 --> 01:01:00,406
(Joon Hyun comes charging in for the 3rd time.)

1617
01:01:01,006 --> 01:01:04,246
(This fat man owns this turf!)

1618
01:01:04,976 --> 01:01:06,206
(What's this?)

1619
01:01:06,206 --> 01:01:07,706
(Don't get tricked.)

1620
01:01:08,606 --> 01:01:10,076
It's hiding somewhere.

1621
01:01:10,206 --> 01:01:12,306
- Ji Hye. - You must get it!

1622
01:01:12,306 --> 01:01:14,106
- You have to get it! - You must get it.

1623
01:01:14,876 --> 01:01:15,876
(Joon Hyun stays stuck to the floor.)

1624
01:01:15,876 --> 01:01:17,976
Where is "Puddles"?

1625
01:01:18,106 --> 01:01:19,946
You should look for it instead of lying down.

1626
01:01:20,776 --> 01:01:22,476
(Master, I hate water.)

1627
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:26,076
Where is it?

1628
01:01:27,176 --> 01:01:28,176
Wait a minute.

1629
01:01:28,306 --> 01:01:29,406
Where is "Puddles"?

1630
01:01:29,406 --> 01:01:31,776
- Don't let someone else take it. - Where is it?

1631
01:01:31,776 --> 01:01:33,676
(What? "Water Bottom"?)

1632
01:01:33,776 --> 01:01:35,176
That's "Water Bottom"!

1633
01:01:35,606 --> 01:01:36,906
(That one is misspelled!)

1634
01:01:38,006 --> 01:01:39,206
(He gropes everywhere to search.)

1635
01:01:39,206 --> 01:01:40,446
- Ji Hyo! - Get out of the way.

1636
01:01:40,876 --> 01:01:43,076
Move. How dare you touch me there?

1637
01:01:43,106 --> 01:01:44,476
Ji Hye is so competitive.

1638
01:01:45,006 --> 01:01:46,206
(It's a fair game.)

1639
01:01:46,206 --> 01:01:48,106
- Ji Hyo, focus on the game! - Ji Hye.

1640
01:01:48,106 --> 01:01:50,506
- Please! - I think it's underneath him.

1641
01:01:50,746 --> 01:01:54,476
(Everyone attacks Joon Hyun.)

1642
01:01:54,476 --> 01:01:55,906
- There you go. - Ji Hye, over here.

1643
01:01:55,906 --> 01:01:58,206
- Ji Hye, it's over there. - Grab it with your bottom.

1644
01:01:58,206 --> 01:01:59,746
(She puts her hand in.)

1645
01:02:00,646 --> 01:02:02,206
Go in!

1646
01:02:02,206 --> 01:02:04,046
Watch where you're putting your hand.

1647
01:02:04,406 --> 01:02:06,906
- Hey, what are you doing? - Come on.

1648
01:02:06,906 --> 01:02:08,476
(Grab "Puddles"!)

1649
01:02:08,476 --> 01:02:10,106
- It's stuck to your bottom. - I can't see anything.

1650
01:02:10,106 --> 01:02:11,876
It's stuck to your bottom.

1651
01:02:11,876 --> 01:02:13,676
- I know. - Get out of the way.

1652
01:02:14,006 --> 01:02:15,146
(I won't let you go.)

1653
01:02:15,146 --> 01:02:17,106
- You shouldn't take it off. - Get out of the way.

1654
01:02:17,106 --> 01:02:18,306
(You're worse than me.)

1655
01:02:18,306 --> 01:02:20,306
- Let it go. - Please let me go.

1656
01:02:20,306 --> 01:02:22,046
- Move out of the way. - Miss.

1657
01:02:22,046 --> 01:02:23,406
(Let go of his bottom.)

1658
01:02:24,306 --> 01:02:25,976
It's already stuck to his bottom.

1659
01:02:25,976 --> 01:02:28,606
- What are you talking about? - She's trying to take it off.

1660
01:02:28,606 --> 01:02:29,976
This isn't a race.

1661
01:02:29,976 --> 01:02:32,276
Lying down on the floor won't help you at all.

1662
01:02:32,706 --> 01:02:34,406
(She doesn't budge.)

1663
01:02:34,406 --> 01:02:35,406
Gosh.

1664
01:02:35,706 --> 01:02:37,406
Let him go.

1665
01:02:37,406 --> 01:02:39,976
(Please take her away from him.)

1666
01:02:39,976 --> 01:02:42,606
- Let's pull Ji Hye away. - She touched my bare skin.

1667
01:02:42,606 --> 01:02:45,776
- Pull her away now. - Ji Hye.

1668
01:02:45,906 --> 01:02:48,546
She put it on her bottom.

1669
01:02:48,876 --> 01:02:51,906
(Did Ji Hye steal the card?)

1670
01:02:51,906 --> 01:02:54,146
- What on earth? - Come on.

1671
01:02:54,146 --> 01:02:55,206
(She stuck many cards on her.)

1672
01:02:56,306 --> 01:02:57,506
Good job, Ji Hye.

1673
01:02:57,506 --> 01:02:59,776
What's the point if she stuck all the cards on her?

1674
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:00,946
Ji Hye!

1675
01:03:00,946 --> 01:03:02,406
(Ji Hye has a strong will.)

1676
01:03:02,606 --> 01:03:04,776
- What's the point? - Ji Hye!

1677
01:03:04,776 --> 01:03:07,276
She cheated because it was already stuck on Joon Hyun.

1678
01:03:07,506 --> 01:03:10,106
- You're the best. - That's cheating.

1679
01:03:10,106 --> 01:03:11,606
(We did it.)

1680
01:03:12,306 --> 01:03:15,946
I'm sorry, but Ji Hye doesn't have six bottoms.

1681
01:03:16,576 --> 01:03:19,306
She touched my bare skin.

1682
01:03:19,306 --> 01:03:21,746
She lay down and pretended to be asleep.

1683
01:03:21,746 --> 01:03:23,546
- I have to be okay. - Are you okay?

1684
01:03:23,746 --> 01:03:26,746
My heart is beating so fast.

1685
01:03:26,906 --> 01:03:27,946
Good job, Ji Hye.

1686
01:03:27,946 --> 01:03:29,146
(She removes puddles for Jae Seok.)

1687
01:03:29,376 --> 01:03:31,206
(Current status of "Find the Right Card")

1688
01:03:31,206 --> 01:03:33,146
- Where are we? - It's based on your colour.

1689
01:03:34,876 --> 01:03:37,246
- It's based on colours. - This is ours.

1690
01:03:37,246 --> 01:03:39,006
You're a fool if you can't win first place.

1691
01:03:39,006 --> 01:03:40,506
Gary's team hardly has obstacles.

1692
01:03:40,506 --> 01:03:42,506
- Gosh. - This looks difficult.

1693
01:03:42,676 --> 01:03:45,106
(It's their last chance to exchange bags.)

1694
01:03:45,106 --> 01:03:47,206
- My master removed... - Good luck.

1695
01:03:47,206 --> 01:03:48,846
so many obstacles for me.

1696
01:03:48,846 --> 01:03:50,576
Gary, you can do it!

1697
01:03:50,876 --> 01:03:52,506
- You can do it, Jae Seok! - Good luck.

1698
01:03:52,646 --> 01:03:55,646
- Seok Jin, you have a chance. - Go, Haha.

1699
01:03:55,906 --> 01:03:57,846
- You can do it, Gary. - I'm sorry.

1700
01:03:57,846 --> 01:03:59,146
(Gary is ready.)

1701
01:03:59,776 --> 01:04:02,206
- Get ready. - You can do it, Haha.

1702
01:04:03,646 --> 01:04:05,376
(Please do well, Jae Seok.)

1703
01:04:06,306 --> 01:04:07,506
Get ready.

1704
01:04:07,506 --> 01:04:10,676
(Don't worry, Master. I'll protect our gold.)

1705
01:04:10,676 --> 01:04:11,676
Start.

1706
01:04:11,676 --> 01:04:13,106
("Obstacle Race" starts.)

1707
01:04:15,376 --> 01:04:17,706
Run, Haha. Run.

1708
01:04:18,006 --> 01:04:20,476
(Gary gets ahead.)

1709
01:04:21,746 --> 01:04:23,776
(Sticky trap slows down Gary and Jong Kook.)

1710
01:04:24,946 --> 01:04:27,106
(Hurdles are ahead for the teams running behind.)

1711
01:04:27,946 --> 01:04:31,706
(Gary, Haha and Kwang Soo are in the lead.)

1712
01:04:32,606 --> 01:04:34,146
(They crawl quickly.)

1713
01:04:35,546 --> 01:04:36,806
Go, Gary!

1714
01:04:37,906 --> 01:04:41,206
(Some avatars enter the hurdle zone.)

1715
01:04:44,106 --> 01:04:47,476
(Everyone passes through the hurdles quickly.)

1716
01:04:48,776 --> 01:04:51,376
(Seok Jin struggles by himself.)

1717
01:04:51,676 --> 01:04:52,946
- You can do it. - Gosh.

1718
01:04:53,576 --> 01:04:56,976
(Seok Jin's team will probably lose.)

1719
01:04:58,146 --> 01:04:59,146
(Meanwhile,)

1720
01:04:59,806 --> 01:05:02,076
(Gary is moving quickly.)

1721
01:05:03,106 --> 01:05:05,206
(He enters the net at the speed of light.)

1722
01:05:06,146 --> 01:05:07,606
(Screaming)

1723
01:05:08,306 --> 01:05:11,006
(Jong Kook enters the plunger zone.)

1724
01:05:11,746 --> 01:05:12,906
(They struggle.)

1725
01:05:14,776 --> 01:05:17,306
(The competition remains fierce.)

1726
01:05:18,006 --> 01:05:19,246
You can do it.

1727
01:05:24,406 --> 01:05:26,206
I can't enter the net.

1728
01:05:26,976 --> 01:05:28,876
(Gary faces difficulties in the net.)

1729
01:05:28,876 --> 01:05:30,306
You can do it.

1730
01:05:30,946 --> 01:05:32,976
- You're doing well. - You can do it.

1731
01:05:32,976 --> 01:05:34,046
- You're doing well. - You can do it.

1732
01:05:34,206 --> 01:05:36,706
(Kwang Soo gets ahead.)

1733
01:05:37,606 --> 01:05:38,806
(I'm glad I removed the net.)

1734
01:05:39,806 --> 01:05:41,606
The net is difficult to get through.

1735
01:05:41,606 --> 01:05:43,206
(Gary finally passes the net.)

1736
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:45,146
The net is difficult.

1737
01:05:45,146 --> 01:05:46,576
(Without the puddles, Jae Seok moves quickly.)

1738
01:05:48,006 --> 01:05:50,406
(I won't let anyone take our bag of gold.)

1739
01:05:50,406 --> 01:05:52,906
You're running first place.

1740
01:05:52,906 --> 01:05:55,406
(Jae Seok moves forward.)

1741
01:05:55,406 --> 01:06:01,006
(Will Gary remain first place?)

1742
01:06:01,006 --> 01:06:02,106
(Gary wins!)

1743
01:06:02,506 --> 01:06:03,506
(He's half a second ahead.)

1744
01:06:07,676 --> 01:06:08,746
That was amazing.

1745
01:06:08,746 --> 01:06:09,976
Goodness.

1746
01:06:10,206 --> 01:06:12,146
(I was so close.)

1747
01:06:12,976 --> 01:06:14,806
That net was so difficult.

1748
01:06:15,846 --> 01:06:17,246
I almost lost the race.

1749
01:06:17,346 --> 01:06:19,306
You almost lost the race, Gary.

1750
01:06:19,306 --> 01:06:20,906
The holes in the net were tiny.

1751
01:06:20,906 --> 01:06:23,006
Right? I could have won the race.

1752
01:06:23,046 --> 01:06:25,746
(Gary and Min Ho are given the chance to exchange bags.)

1753
01:06:25,746 --> 01:06:28,506
- There were screws on the floor. - I see.

1754
01:06:28,506 --> 01:06:29,606
(Kwang Soo got injured.)

1755
01:06:29,606 --> 01:06:31,076
It's okay.

1756
01:06:31,376 --> 01:06:33,376
(Did my dear Kwang Soo get hurt?)

1757
01:06:33,746 --> 01:06:36,006
- That's fortunate. - He's okay.

1758
01:06:36,006 --> 01:06:37,246
He got a small cut.

1759
01:06:37,506 --> 01:06:40,676
- Goodness, look at that. - Ji Hyo is putting on some bandage.

1760
01:06:40,876 --> 01:06:42,906
My goodness.

1761
01:06:42,906 --> 01:06:45,646
Ji Hyo is so sweet, but she can be so aggressive at times.

1762
01:06:46,106 --> 01:06:47,946
- I don't understand her. - I'm not sure...

1763
01:06:47,946 --> 01:06:49,376
- what kind of person she is. - I don't understand her.

1764
01:06:49,806 --> 01:06:51,306
She's sweet right now.

1765
01:06:51,306 --> 01:06:53,206
My mum is fickle about her, too.

1766
01:06:53,606 --> 01:06:55,406
(Ji Hyo is very fickle.)

1767
01:06:56,406 --> 01:06:58,976
Gary and Min Ho, you may exchange your bags with another team.

1768
01:06:58,976 --> 01:07:01,976
(Which team will Gary and Min Ho choose?)

1769
01:07:02,476 --> 01:07:05,306
- How about Haha's team? - Haha's team?

1770
01:07:05,306 --> 01:07:07,146
We don't have any gold.

1771
01:07:07,146 --> 01:07:08,476
- You don't? - He's lying.

1772
01:07:08,776 --> 01:07:11,146
I normally get upset easily. I'm sorry.

1773
01:07:11,476 --> 01:07:13,846
- We'll exchange with this bag. - Okay.

1774
01:07:13,846 --> 01:07:14,906
(They choose Jae Seok's bag.)

1775
01:07:14,976 --> 01:07:16,306
Jae Seok's bag?

1776
01:07:16,306 --> 01:07:17,306
(I hope it's not the one with gold.)

1777
01:07:17,776 --> 01:07:19,846
- They look nervous. - Did you keep our bag safely?

1778
01:07:19,846 --> 01:07:20,846
Yes.

1779
01:07:21,206 --> 01:07:23,346
Is this our bag?

1780
01:07:24,406 --> 01:07:27,306
(They open the bag.)

1781
01:07:29,106 --> 01:07:30,706
(Here's the gold.)

1782
01:07:32,746 --> 01:07:34,476
- Gosh. - They got gold.

1783
01:07:34,476 --> 01:07:35,676
(Did his fake acting succeed?)

1784
01:07:36,806 --> 01:07:37,846
I bet they got gold.

1785
01:07:38,976 --> 01:07:40,476
I think they did.

1786
01:07:40,576 --> 01:07:42,506
Min Ho's reaction is too awkward.

1787
01:07:42,506 --> 01:07:44,176
(Jong Kook is quick.)

1788
01:07:45,176 --> 01:07:46,306
(What's in Ji Hye and Jae Seok's bag?)

1789
01:07:46,306 --> 01:07:47,646
- Is this our new bag? - Yes.

1790
01:07:48,706 --> 01:07:49,976
She seems upset.

1791
01:07:49,976 --> 01:07:53,746
Ji Hye looks very upset. I can see it on her face.

1792
01:07:53,746 --> 01:07:54,776
(Did Ji Hye get the right bag?)

1793
01:07:54,776 --> 01:07:56,006
- She looks very upset. - I'm not upset.

1794
01:07:56,006 --> 01:07:58,506
- Do you have a bomb in both bags? - That would be funny.

1795
01:07:58,506 --> 01:07:59,506
Then she has two bombs.

1796
01:07:59,776 --> 01:08:01,406
(This morning,)

1797
01:08:01,406 --> 01:08:05,346
(Gary and Min Ho chose their bag carefully.)

1798
01:08:06,246 --> 01:08:08,876
We have to exchange the bags carefully.

1799
01:08:09,646 --> 01:08:10,746
Shall I open mine first?

1800
01:08:10,746 --> 01:08:12,006
(Inside their bag,)

1801
01:08:12,006 --> 01:08:13,706
(they find a bomb.)

1802
01:08:13,706 --> 01:08:15,806
We have a bomb.

1803
01:08:16,406 --> 01:08:19,106
(When Jae Seok and Jong Kook exchanged bags...)

1804
01:08:19,506 --> 01:08:20,506
I'll exchange with this.

1805
01:08:20,506 --> 01:08:22,006
(Min Ho and Gary waited for their chance.)

1806
01:08:22,846 --> 01:08:25,946
(Gary and Min Ho exchanged their bomb with gold.)

1807
01:08:28,746 --> 01:08:30,946
(Their plan becomes successful.)

1808
01:08:31,976 --> 01:08:33,376
Why did they exchange with ours?

1809
01:08:33,906 --> 01:08:37,206
She shouldn't have said anything. She made a big mistake.

1810
01:08:37,206 --> 01:08:38,946
I think we got something good.

1811
01:08:39,476 --> 01:08:42,046
At the end, something seemed strange.

1812
01:08:43,006 --> 01:08:45,606
- Ji Hye got angry. - She got angry.

1813
01:08:45,816 --> 01:08:49,676
Also, Jae Seok's eyes quivered so much.

1814
01:08:49,746 --> 01:08:53,676
- I think... - We have a good chance of winning.

1815
01:08:55,316 --> 01:08:56,316
(Gary and Min Ho get the gold.)

1816
01:08:56,316 --> 01:08:57,846
(The other two teams have bombs.)

1817
01:08:58,876 --> 01:09:01,746
The final race is "Pass the Bomb".

1818
01:09:02,246 --> 01:09:04,816
When the four teams without the bomb...

1819
01:09:04,816 --> 01:09:07,946
find two bags of gold that are hidden,

1820
01:09:07,946 --> 01:09:11,276
they get to escape and are exempt from being penalised.

1821
01:09:11,316 --> 01:09:16,246
One of the teams has a bag of gold already.

1822
01:09:16,246 --> 01:09:18,906
That team has to find one more bag.

1823
01:09:18,906 --> 01:09:20,206
(That team is Gary and Min Ho.)

1824
01:09:20,206 --> 01:09:23,146
The teams with a bomb...

1825
01:09:23,776 --> 01:09:27,406
can give the bomb to someone else by taking off his name tag.

1826
01:09:28,046 --> 01:09:31,606
Only the masters can take off the name tags.

1827
01:09:31,606 --> 01:09:33,316
(There are only seven bags of gold.)

1828
01:09:35,316 --> 01:09:37,846
(Find 2 bags of gold to escape.)

1829
01:09:38,746 --> 01:09:40,606
Only the team with bombs can rip name tags.

1830
01:09:40,606 --> 01:09:41,606
(They pretend not to have a bomb.)

1831
01:09:41,606 --> 01:09:43,606
Let's pretend like we're looking for the bags.

1832
01:09:44,176 --> 01:09:46,576
- Do you mean the bags of gold? - Yes.

1833
01:09:46,676 --> 01:09:49,546
Other teams don't know that we have a bomb.

1834
01:09:50,476 --> 01:09:51,876
It's Jae Seok's team.

1835
01:09:51,876 --> 01:09:53,276
Who is it?

1836
01:09:53,876 --> 01:09:55,106
- It's Jae Seok. - It's Jae Seok.

1837
01:09:55,406 --> 01:09:56,646
He doesn't have anything.

1838
01:09:57,006 --> 01:09:59,546
- We can catch Ji Hyo. - Let's go downstairs.

1839
01:09:59,976 --> 01:10:02,376
They might think we have a bomb.

1840
01:10:02,376 --> 01:10:03,906
They might.

1841
01:10:03,906 --> 01:10:06,476
- We can pretend to attack. - Okay.

1842
01:10:06,476 --> 01:10:07,876
(They pretend as if they have a bomb.)

1843
01:10:07,876 --> 01:10:08,876
(She hesitates.)

1844
01:10:10,576 --> 01:10:12,606
(Do Yeon and Jong Kook appear.)

1845
01:10:12,606 --> 01:10:14,706
(They must run to survive.)

1846
01:10:15,576 --> 01:10:17,816
(He runs after Ji Hyo, the master.)

1847
01:10:17,816 --> 01:10:19,176
Run away, Ji Hyo!

1848
01:10:19,376 --> 01:10:21,446
Run away, Ji Hyo!

1849
01:10:22,206 --> 01:10:24,816
I caught her. Hurry, Do Yeon.

1850
01:10:24,906 --> 01:10:27,246
(I'll protect my master.)

1851
01:10:27,246 --> 01:10:28,506
(Only Do Yeon can take off the name tag.)

1852
01:10:28,506 --> 01:10:30,906
- Do Yeon, you must come here. - Run away, Ji Hyo!

1853
01:10:31,346 --> 01:10:33,316
- It's already over. - Hurry up, Do Yeon.

1854
01:10:33,316 --> 01:10:34,316
Kick him there!

1855
01:10:34,816 --> 01:10:36,676
- Where? - Kick him there!

1856
01:10:38,506 --> 01:10:39,746
I'm sorry, Ji Hyo.

1857
01:10:41,706 --> 01:10:43,676
(Ji Hyo is at the risk of getting a bomb.)

1858
01:10:43,676 --> 01:10:45,276
- I'm sorry, Ji Hyo. - I'm sorry.

1859
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:47,876
(Ji Hyo's name tag is ripped.)

1860
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:50,576
I'm sorry. You'd do the same in our shoes.

1861
01:10:50,576 --> 01:10:52,106
- We're in a hurry. - Catch someone else.

1862
01:10:52,376 --> 01:10:53,776
(This is unfair.)

1863
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:56,816
I don't want the bomb any more.

1864
01:10:56,816 --> 01:10:58,046
(Do Yeon and Jong Kook get rid of their bomb.)

1865
01:10:58,046 --> 01:10:59,746
- He's such a gentleman. - Come to your senses.

1866
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:01,606
(They can look for bags of gold.)

1867
01:11:01,606 --> 01:11:04,146
- Why? - We need to focus on the gold now.

1868
01:11:04,146 --> 01:11:05,606
We have a bomb now.

1869
01:11:05,606 --> 01:11:07,546
I can't believe that they got us.

1870
01:11:07,546 --> 01:11:10,776
If you hide it like this, nobody will know you have a bomb.

1871
01:11:10,776 --> 01:11:12,376
(They became a new bomb.)

1872
01:11:13,706 --> 01:11:15,646
It could be somewhere here.

1873
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:17,276
(They came down to the underground level.)

1874
01:11:17,276 --> 01:11:19,046
(We really want to find gold.)

1875
01:11:19,046 --> 01:11:20,646
Let's go this way.

1876
01:11:20,646 --> 01:11:21,746
(He looks around.)

1877
01:11:21,746 --> 01:11:22,816
What is it?

1878
01:11:24,046 --> 01:11:25,076
(What is it? Are you a bomb?)

1879
01:11:25,076 --> 01:11:28,176
- What is it? Are you a bomb? - I was startled.

1880
01:11:28,176 --> 01:11:29,876
- I'm not a bomb. - Be honest.

1881
01:11:29,876 --> 01:11:32,676
- I'm not. We're looking for it. - I was frightened.

1882
01:11:33,906 --> 01:11:36,446
- You guys are not, are you? - No, we're not.

1883
01:11:36,816 --> 01:11:39,046
- I was startled. - There is somebody.

1884
01:11:39,046 --> 01:11:40,816
Who? Who's coming now?

1885
01:11:41,206 --> 01:11:43,976
- Someone is coming. Go back. - What?

1886
01:11:43,976 --> 01:11:45,816
(Who else? It's me.)

1887
01:11:45,816 --> 01:11:49,046
(She's as fast as lightening with aggressive hands.)

1888
01:11:49,046 --> 01:11:50,076
(Jae Seok is fully supporting her.)

1889
01:11:50,076 --> 01:11:52,176
Haha, Haha.

1890
01:11:52,176 --> 01:11:53,276
(She tears it off.)

1891
01:11:53,876 --> 01:11:55,506
You guys are so fast.

1892
01:11:55,546 --> 01:11:56,746
I'm sorry.

1893
01:11:56,746 --> 01:11:59,276
It's that woman again who touched my bottom.

1894
01:11:59,676 --> 01:12:00,976
Goodness.

1895
01:12:00,976 --> 01:12:02,906
Let's hide this under here.

1896
01:12:02,946 --> 01:12:04,846
You have to pretend not to be a bomb.

1897
01:12:04,846 --> 01:12:05,846
(The bomb goes to Joon Hyun and Haha.)

1898
01:12:05,846 --> 01:12:09,146
We need to find the gold quickly.

1899
01:12:09,146 --> 01:12:10,316
(They can look for the gold now.)

1900
01:12:10,446 --> 01:12:11,876
Let's get out of here quickly.

1901
01:12:13,476 --> 01:12:14,876
Now, I feel like I'm really on Running Man.

1902
01:12:14,876 --> 01:12:16,646
- Now you feel it. - I feel my heart pounding.

1903
01:12:16,646 --> 01:12:18,476
- You do? - I feel like I'm in Running Man.

1904
01:12:18,506 --> 01:12:20,476
- It looks like real Running Man. - Yes.

1905
01:12:21,746 --> 01:12:23,316
(Peeking)

1906
01:12:23,646 --> 01:12:25,706
Okay. Look over there. Isn't there any?

1907
01:12:26,876 --> 01:12:28,316
I can hear some sound.

1908
01:12:28,906 --> 01:12:32,346
(What's happening upstairs?)

1909
01:12:32,346 --> 01:12:33,946
Sorry. I was not thinking enough.

1910
01:12:34,176 --> 01:12:36,746
I was not. I won't do it again.

1911
01:12:36,746 --> 01:12:37,976
What is it?

1912
01:12:38,606 --> 01:12:40,676
- I was not thinking enough. - Hey.

1913
01:12:40,676 --> 01:12:42,706
- They have bombs. - Just...

1914
01:12:42,876 --> 01:12:45,816
help get others quickly.

1915
01:12:45,816 --> 01:12:47,246
Wait, is it Ji Hyo?

1916
01:12:47,246 --> 01:12:48,476
(They run automatically.)

1917
01:12:48,476 --> 01:12:49,506
(The bomb is after you.)

1918
01:12:49,506 --> 01:12:50,576
Are you coming?

1919
01:12:51,206 --> 01:12:52,446
I'm okay. Keep running.

1920
01:12:52,646 --> 01:12:53,746
It's a bomb.

1921
01:12:54,006 --> 01:12:55,206
Run away.

1922
01:12:56,506 --> 01:12:57,606
Hey.

1923
01:12:57,976 --> 01:12:59,906
- Jong Kook, I'm on my way. - Do Yeon, keep away from them.

1924
01:12:59,906 --> 01:13:01,476
I'm following you.

1925
01:13:01,476 --> 01:13:03,816
(The owner has a hard time running.)

1926
01:13:05,906 --> 01:13:07,006
Where did he go?

1927
01:13:08,476 --> 01:13:09,676
Where is he?

1928
01:13:12,546 --> 01:13:15,316
Where is Se Chan? I lost him.

1929
01:13:16,476 --> 01:13:17,906
Se Chan.

1930
01:13:18,576 --> 01:13:19,876
Where are you?

1931
01:13:20,546 --> 01:13:22,506
Have you seen Se Chan?

1932
01:13:23,446 --> 01:13:24,816
(They lost each other while running away.)

1933
01:13:25,176 --> 01:13:26,946
Where did he go?

1934
01:13:27,876 --> 01:13:29,846
- Can I warm up a bit? - Sure.

1935
01:13:29,846 --> 01:13:31,816
- I'm really fast. - You are fast.

1936
01:13:31,946 --> 01:13:34,576
- I run so fast. - He keeps saying he's fast.

1937
01:13:34,606 --> 01:13:36,406
You will make me anxious.

1938
01:13:36,816 --> 01:13:38,276
You're fast, aren't you?

1939
01:13:38,976 --> 01:13:41,176
(Is this what you meant?)

1940
01:13:41,176 --> 01:13:44,106
Where did he go? He is really fast.

1941
01:13:44,246 --> 01:13:47,576
Are you Se Chan's cameraman? Where is he?

1942
01:13:47,876 --> 01:13:49,446
You didn't find him?

1943
01:13:50,606 --> 01:13:53,906
I'm going crazy. Is he off-camera, then?

1944
01:13:56,006 --> 01:13:58,246
(He's right.)

1945
01:14:00,006 --> 01:14:02,906
(He's shooting Running Man alone.)

1946
01:14:04,446 --> 01:14:06,406
(It's hard to find him.)

1947
01:14:06,406 --> 01:14:07,946
Now, I'm relieved.

1948
01:14:10,246 --> 01:14:13,146
- We need to find the gold. - Where can we find it?

1949
01:14:14,276 --> 01:14:15,606
- Gosh. - I'm startled.

1950
01:14:16,206 --> 01:14:18,176
- What are you doing? - Excuse me?

1951
01:14:18,176 --> 01:14:19,176
The bomb is coming down.

1952
01:14:19,376 --> 01:14:20,376
Did you say bomb?

1953
01:14:20,376 --> 01:14:22,376
Kwang Soo. He's coming.

1954
01:14:22,746 --> 01:14:23,746
He's coming again.

1955
01:14:23,746 --> 01:14:24,906
(They noticed the pink bomb instinctively.)

1956
01:14:24,906 --> 01:14:26,176
Why are you following me?

1957
01:14:26,706 --> 01:14:28,676
(Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo should pass the bomb to find the gold.)

1958
01:14:28,676 --> 01:14:30,646
Run away, Min Ho.

1959
01:14:30,746 --> 01:14:32,246
Run away.

1960
01:14:33,006 --> 01:14:37,076
(Gary tries to block Kwang Soo.)

1961
01:14:37,076 --> 01:14:38,146
I failed.

1962
01:14:39,146 --> 01:14:40,346
Come over here.

1963
01:14:40,876 --> 01:14:42,646
- Come here. - Get Ji Hyo.

1964
01:14:42,646 --> 01:14:43,876
Please block Ji Hyo.

1965
01:14:43,876 --> 01:14:45,206
Ji Hyo.

1966
01:14:46,076 --> 01:14:48,676
Tear it off. You can just tear it off, Ji Hyo.

1967
01:14:49,676 --> 01:14:51,146
(He desperately defends himself.)

1968
01:14:51,146 --> 01:14:52,746
Why are you doing this to us?

1969
01:14:52,746 --> 01:14:54,446
- Tear it off. - No.

1970
01:14:54,576 --> 01:14:55,876
I'll tickle him.

1971
01:14:56,476 --> 01:14:57,506
(She tears his name tag off.)

1972
01:14:57,506 --> 01:15:00,246
Kwang Soo, why do you tickle me?

1973
01:15:01,176 --> 01:15:02,446
Goodness.

1974
01:15:03,076 --> 01:15:04,476
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

1975
01:15:04,476 --> 01:15:07,316
- But we take turns to get bombs. - You're right.

1976
01:15:09,346 --> 01:15:11,976
Se Chan. Se Chan.

1977
01:15:12,476 --> 01:15:13,706
Se Chan.

1978
01:15:14,046 --> 01:15:16,206
Se Chan.

1979
01:15:16,946 --> 01:15:19,176
Hey. Come up.

1980
01:15:19,406 --> 01:15:20,546
There he is.

1981
01:15:20,676 --> 01:15:22,606
I found him.

1982
01:15:24,006 --> 01:15:26,346
You're safe. Did you lose your name tag?

1983
01:15:26,346 --> 01:15:28,046
No, I didn't.

1984
01:15:28,146 --> 01:15:29,446
I kept running away.

1985
01:15:29,446 --> 01:15:31,176
- Well done. - I kept looking for you.

1986
01:15:31,176 --> 01:15:33,406
I was looking for you, too. They're running.

1987
01:15:33,406 --> 01:15:35,576
They're coming up. Come here.

1988
01:15:35,576 --> 01:15:36,746
Come here, Seok Jin.

1989
01:15:37,746 --> 01:15:39,046
(We'll crush you.)

1990
01:15:39,046 --> 01:15:41,276
- Seok Jin, do you have gold? - No, I don't.

1991
01:15:41,576 --> 01:15:43,406
- Go find one. - At this time...

1992
01:15:43,406 --> 01:15:46,176
- Really. - Jae Seok and Kwang Soo...

1993
01:15:46,176 --> 01:15:47,676
See? I knew it.

1994
01:15:47,906 --> 01:15:49,206
Hey, Hey.

1995
01:15:49,676 --> 01:15:51,906
Catch him.

1996
01:15:51,946 --> 01:15:55,976
Catch him.

1997
01:15:56,346 --> 01:15:58,046
I told you to catch him.

1998
01:15:58,046 --> 01:15:59,606
(The giraffe and the rhino attacks him.)

1999
01:15:59,606 --> 01:16:00,606
Did you get him?

2000
01:16:01,406 --> 01:16:04,246
I got him for you.

2001
01:16:04,646 --> 01:16:06,676
You should remember this.

2002
01:16:06,676 --> 01:16:08,206
You have to.

2003
01:16:08,206 --> 01:16:10,146
- Please remember this. - You, fool. You should help me.

2004
01:16:10,146 --> 01:16:13,176
Fool? I didn't like you from the start.

2005
01:16:13,246 --> 01:16:14,606
How dare you call him a fool.

2006
01:16:14,606 --> 01:16:16,546
- I caught him. - You have to help me.

2007
01:16:16,546 --> 01:16:18,046
Let's help each other.

2008
01:16:18,276 --> 01:16:19,576
Excuse us.

2009
01:16:20,276 --> 01:16:22,446
(At the moment they wanted to rest)

2010
01:16:24,206 --> 01:16:26,006
(They look scary.)

2011
01:16:26,006 --> 01:16:28,676
- Gosh, I'm startled. - Wait.

2012
01:16:28,676 --> 01:16:30,206
- What is it? - Oh, I see.

2013
01:16:30,206 --> 01:16:32,276
How can you do this to us as soon as you see us?

2014
01:16:32,276 --> 01:16:33,876
We were hiding to do this.

2015
01:16:34,206 --> 01:16:35,276
What is that?

2016
01:16:36,276 --> 01:16:37,576
Min Ho, come quickly.

2017
01:16:38,346 --> 01:16:39,746
Min Ho, come quickly.

2018
01:16:39,746 --> 01:16:40,876
Gosh.

2019
01:16:40,876 --> 01:16:42,206
(They get bombs again.)

2020
01:16:42,206 --> 01:16:43,746
- We got the bombs right away. - We can't help it.

2021
01:16:43,746 --> 01:16:45,606
(They get bombs again.)

2022
01:16:45,606 --> 01:16:47,046
(Se Chan, Seok Jin, Joon Hyun and Haha have bombs.)

2023
01:16:47,046 --> 01:16:49,176
Min Ho, Min Ho.

2024
01:16:49,176 --> 01:16:51,706
(Right after they tossed the bombs, they find a bag.)

2025
01:16:51,706 --> 01:16:54,106
Did you find it?

2026
01:16:54,476 --> 01:16:56,006
- I found it. - You did?

2027
01:16:56,006 --> 01:16:58,976
I can't open it.

2028
01:17:01,646 --> 01:17:04,346
(It's really gold.)

2029
01:17:04,816 --> 01:17:06,476
Aren't we too fast?

2030
01:17:06,606 --> 01:17:08,846
Really? Is it over already?

2031
01:17:08,906 --> 01:17:10,246
Oh my gosh.

2032
01:17:10,246 --> 01:17:11,846
We found them too easily.

2033
01:17:13,446 --> 01:17:15,606
Shall we go over now?

2034
01:17:16,276 --> 01:17:18,816
- Should we go downstairs? - Let's go. We already have gold.

2035
01:17:19,676 --> 01:17:21,576
Is there anything? What is it?

2036
01:17:21,876 --> 01:17:24,506
Goodness. If this is gold, why don't you go out with me?

2037
01:17:25,246 --> 01:17:27,146
- Gosh. - Goodness.

2038
01:17:29,706 --> 01:17:31,076
(They don't know what to do.)

2039
01:17:31,076 --> 01:17:32,176
- This is incredible. - It is.

2040
01:17:32,176 --> 01:17:33,746
Do you want to go out with me?

2041
01:17:33,746 --> 01:17:35,316
But my opinion is important, too.

2042
01:17:35,316 --> 01:17:36,876
Then you should've told me your opinion.

2043
01:17:36,876 --> 01:17:38,476
- Why should I? - You should have told me.

2044
01:17:38,476 --> 01:17:41,346
- I thought it was not gold. - I told you. Check with the camera.

2045
01:17:41,346 --> 01:17:42,476
(We started to date from today.)

2046
01:17:42,476 --> 01:17:43,816
Is this our first day, then?

2047
01:17:43,816 --> 01:17:45,976
Sure. Although we can break up any time.

2048
01:17:45,976 --> 01:17:48,076
- Let's break up tonight, then. - This is really gold.

2049
01:17:49,446 --> 01:17:51,406
- You're so cool. - I don't know what's going on.

2050
01:17:51,406 --> 01:17:53,406
- He's incredible. - I looked just in case.

2051
01:17:53,406 --> 01:17:55,176
You look awesome.

2052
01:17:56,176 --> 01:17:57,506
He looks awesome.

2053
01:17:57,506 --> 01:18:00,706
He's so cool that I want to marry him.

2054
01:18:00,706 --> 01:18:01,976
(They succeed in escaping.)

2055
01:18:02,276 --> 01:18:03,776
They might be here.

2056
01:18:03,906 --> 01:18:05,346
Let's look around here.

2057
01:18:05,846 --> 01:18:09,706
(They're looking for gold.)

2058
01:18:10,276 --> 01:18:12,076
You need to look carefully.

2059
01:18:12,076 --> 01:18:15,746
(She searches where others didn't look.)

2060
01:18:18,176 --> 01:18:20,106
Kwang Soo.

2061
01:18:20,106 --> 01:18:21,206
Why?

2062
01:18:22,846 --> 01:18:23,976
Did you find it?

2063
01:18:24,506 --> 01:18:27,446
(She finds gold as soon as she opens it.)

2064
01:18:27,446 --> 01:18:28,706
(They need one more to escape.)

2065
01:18:28,706 --> 01:18:29,776
We are getting close.

2066
01:18:32,906 --> 01:18:34,946
What are you looking at? Is it a bag?

2067
01:18:35,476 --> 01:18:36,506
How did you see this?

2068
01:18:36,506 --> 01:18:38,346
How did you see?

2069
01:18:39,006 --> 01:18:40,606
She is unbelievable.

2070
01:18:41,946 --> 01:18:43,906
(She finds gold consecutively.)

2071
01:18:43,906 --> 01:18:44,976
I found it.

2072
01:18:44,976 --> 01:18:49,406
(She surely has lucky hands.)

2073
01:18:50,546 --> 01:18:52,076
Goodness.

2074
01:18:52,106 --> 01:18:55,606
It was so dramatic today, but we made it.

2075
01:18:55,606 --> 01:18:58,276
(Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo escape, too.)

2076
01:18:58,276 --> 01:18:59,346
We can escape, right?

2077
01:19:00,316 --> 01:19:01,846
(The status of "Pass the Bomb")

2078
01:19:01,846 --> 01:19:05,816
(Jong Kook, Gary and Ji Hyo's teams escape.)

2079
01:19:06,846 --> 01:19:09,106
(There are three teams left.)

2080
01:19:09,776 --> 01:19:11,776
It's a disaster if they both attack us at the same time.

2081
01:19:11,776 --> 01:19:14,046
Let's find Jae Seok.

2082
01:19:14,176 --> 01:19:16,346
We have to find someone first and pass the bombs.

2083
01:19:16,346 --> 01:19:18,746
We have to...

2084
01:19:18,816 --> 01:19:20,746
- focus on finding gold. - We have to.

2085
01:19:21,176 --> 01:19:22,846
Let's pass the bomb to Jae Seok...

2086
01:19:23,246 --> 01:19:24,906
and find gold.

2087
01:19:24,906 --> 01:19:26,846
Cheer up.

2088
01:19:26,906 --> 01:19:27,976
I'm exhausted, too.

2089
01:19:28,076 --> 01:19:29,606
I'm getting upset. Quickly.

2090
01:19:30,706 --> 01:19:32,006
We need to be swift.

2091
01:19:32,946 --> 01:19:36,246
(Ji Hye and Jae Seok try hard to find gold.)

2092
01:19:36,246 --> 01:19:37,606
Where can it be?

2093
01:19:38,346 --> 01:19:39,376
Why?

2094
01:19:39,376 --> 01:19:41,106
(Se Chan Attacks her.)

2095
01:19:41,676 --> 01:19:43,376
(Se Chan hunts her while she was alone.)

2096
01:19:43,376 --> 01:19:44,446
I can't hold on.

2097
01:19:45,546 --> 01:19:47,546
Let me tear it.

2098
01:19:48,206 --> 01:19:50,176
- Se Chan. - I eliminated it.

2099
01:19:50,276 --> 01:19:51,546
(The bombs go back to Ji Hye and Jae Seok.)

2100
01:19:51,546 --> 01:19:53,746
- I took it off. - What happened?

2101
01:19:53,746 --> 01:19:55,346
- I took it off. - Did you?

2102
01:19:55,346 --> 01:19:56,506
Good job.

2103
01:19:57,746 --> 01:19:59,506
Let's go to find gold.

2104
01:19:59,506 --> 01:20:00,676
This way.

2105
01:20:01,546 --> 01:20:03,876
Whether it's us or them,

2106
01:20:04,376 --> 01:20:06,006
someone has to find the gold.

2107
01:20:06,876 --> 01:20:09,706
This way. Come this way.

2108
01:20:10,576 --> 01:20:11,846
What is it?

2109
01:20:12,576 --> 01:20:14,906
(Welcome to the trap.)

2110
01:20:17,606 --> 01:20:19,076
(Joon Hyun tears the name tag.)

2111
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:22,846
(The bombs move to Se Chan and Seok Jin.)

2112
01:20:23,546 --> 01:20:26,506
I took his name tag. Pass the bombs to them.

2113
01:20:26,816 --> 01:20:28,076
Let's finish it right away.

2114
01:20:28,076 --> 01:20:29,846
Wait a moment.

2115
01:20:31,146 --> 01:20:32,876
They must be waiting for us here.

2116
01:20:32,876 --> 01:20:34,876
- We kept waiting for you. - You kept waiting?

2117
01:20:35,176 --> 01:20:36,546
- Was the gold there? - I'm completely exhausted.

2118
01:20:37,006 --> 01:20:40,346
- Sorry, Seok Jin. - Sorry.

2119
01:20:42,506 --> 01:20:44,606
There it is.

2120
01:20:44,606 --> 01:20:45,646
(Before they started to hunt to pass bombs,)

2121
01:20:45,646 --> 01:20:49,316
(they already found gold in the beginning of the race.)

2122
01:20:49,316 --> 01:20:50,816
It's gold.

2123
01:20:50,816 --> 01:20:52,276
(They already found gold in the beginning of the race.)

2124
01:20:52,746 --> 01:20:56,976
If we find gold first and keep waiting, they'll appear there.

2125
01:20:57,206 --> 01:20:58,406
Let's go upstairs.

2126
01:20:58,406 --> 01:21:00,276
(They found gold first and hid it.)

2127
01:21:00,276 --> 01:21:02,676
There it is. I found it.

2128
01:21:02,676 --> 01:21:03,876
(So they can escape as soon as they pass the bomb.)

2129
01:21:03,876 --> 01:21:06,146
Let's hide.

2130
01:21:06,406 --> 01:21:07,446
Let's hide.

2131
01:21:08,176 --> 01:21:09,846
Chase them, then let them go.

2132
01:21:11,746 --> 01:21:12,776
Open it.

2133
01:21:12,776 --> 01:21:14,976
- I'm sorry, Seok Jin. - Sorry.

2134
01:21:14,976 --> 01:21:16,376
- Hey. - I'm sorry.

2135
01:21:16,376 --> 01:21:18,846
You look like a bear, but you're pretty sharp.

2136
01:21:18,846 --> 01:21:20,006
We found it.

2137
01:21:20,316 --> 01:21:21,346
(Joon Hyun and Haha escape last.)

2138
01:21:21,346 --> 01:21:23,906
- We ran out of energy. - I'm about to cry.

2139
01:21:25,506 --> 01:21:27,006
Today's final race.

2140
01:21:27,006 --> 01:21:31,176
There is a death match for the owner of the bomb bag.

2141
01:21:31,176 --> 01:21:34,876
The owner in each team will sit at the death match table.

2142
01:21:34,876 --> 01:21:37,076
Why is Se Chan always so unlucky?

2143
01:21:37,076 --> 01:21:40,276
I don't know. Why does it always happen to me?

2144
01:21:40,346 --> 01:21:44,046
Seok Jin and Jae Seok. Sit under the balloons.

2145
01:21:44,106 --> 01:21:47,316
- Should we take off our hats? - What should we do? Take it off?

2146
01:21:47,316 --> 01:21:50,576
On the table, there is one bomb bag...

2147
01:21:50,846 --> 01:21:52,706
and one regular bag.

2148
01:21:52,706 --> 01:21:55,106
You must try and switch...

2149
01:21:55,106 --> 01:21:59,446
your opponent's regular bag with your bomb bag.

2150
01:21:59,446 --> 01:22:03,646
- The goal is to give away bombs. - This makes me nervous.

2151
01:22:03,646 --> 01:22:05,146
This is going to be a mind game.

2152
01:22:05,406 --> 01:22:08,476
- Master, please... - What do we do?

2153
01:22:08,476 --> 01:22:11,606
Why am I treated like this until the end?

2154
01:22:11,606 --> 01:22:13,706
- Master. - This isn't on, right?

2155
01:22:13,706 --> 01:22:15,376
It makes me nervous to just watch.

2156
01:22:15,406 --> 01:22:18,646
(The one to make the first move will win.)

2157
01:22:18,646 --> 01:22:20,176
Press the button.

2158
01:22:21,146 --> 01:22:22,476
One, two...

2159
01:22:22,476 --> 01:22:23,976
(Who will go first?)

2160
01:22:23,976 --> 01:22:25,046
Three.

2161
01:22:26,576 --> 01:22:28,276
(Stinging)

2162
01:22:29,076 --> 01:22:30,546
- Who is it? - Endure it.

2163
01:22:30,546 --> 01:22:33,106
(I can do anything to win.)

2164
01:22:33,106 --> 01:22:34,576
She's hiding it.

2165
01:22:34,706 --> 01:22:36,506
How did you do that?

2166
01:22:36,506 --> 01:22:38,946
She lifted her thumb.

2167
01:22:38,946 --> 01:22:41,906
- How are you so spiteful? - It's okay, she endured it.

2168
01:22:41,906 --> 01:22:44,506
- She's tearing up. - It's okay, she acted well.

2169
01:22:44,946 --> 01:22:46,446
You're the best.

2170
01:22:46,876 --> 01:22:48,846
- It's so funny. - I've never seen anyone like that.

2171
01:22:48,946 --> 01:22:51,006
- Come on the show again. - You're the best.

2172
01:22:51,006 --> 01:22:52,746
- You must come again. - Seriously.

2173
01:22:52,746 --> 01:22:55,046
She endured it by biting her tongue.

2174
01:22:55,276 --> 01:22:57,076
She endured the electricity.

2175
01:22:57,206 --> 01:22:58,576
Okay, here we go.

2176
01:22:59,646 --> 01:23:01,676
- Press it when it changes. - You have to press right away.

2177
01:23:01,676 --> 01:23:05,776
(Who will be faster?)

2178
01:23:05,776 --> 01:23:07,006
(Screaming)

2179
01:23:07,006 --> 01:23:09,276
(Yang Se Chan loses.)

2180
01:23:09,276 --> 01:23:11,576
(That's what I'm talking about.)

2181
01:23:11,576 --> 01:23:13,976
You can't endure it.

2182
01:23:13,976 --> 01:23:15,006
It hurts.

2183
01:23:15,006 --> 01:23:17,476
- That's amazing. - She's hard-core.

2184
01:23:17,476 --> 01:23:19,206
- She's hard-core. - She was faster.

2185
01:23:19,576 --> 01:23:21,506
She's scary.

2186
01:23:21,506 --> 01:23:23,846
- She's a scary woman. - I didn't know that was possible.

2187
01:23:24,006 --> 01:23:25,646
Death match will start now.

2188
01:23:25,776 --> 01:23:27,476
Your chances are 50 percent.

2189
01:23:27,476 --> 01:23:28,706
(Death match starts now.)

2190
01:23:28,706 --> 01:23:30,276
Please check your bags.

2191
01:23:30,406 --> 01:23:31,906
- We chose those. - Yes.

2192
01:23:31,906 --> 01:23:33,906
(The teams are checking the bags.)

2193
01:23:33,906 --> 01:23:35,376
- Se Chan looks cool. - Wow, Se Chan.

2194
01:23:35,376 --> 01:23:36,976
- He has a poker face. - He looks cool.

2195
01:23:37,546 --> 01:23:39,206
- You can't tell. - You can't read him.

2196
01:23:39,346 --> 01:23:40,946
He looks like he's in a movie.

2197
01:23:41,146 --> 01:23:43,046
Se Chan, look at me.

2198
01:23:43,406 --> 01:23:45,106
Master, just for once.

2199
01:23:45,176 --> 01:23:46,506
I don't think that helps.

2200
01:23:46,506 --> 01:23:48,376
Look at Ji Hye's eyes.

2201
01:23:48,976 --> 01:23:51,346
Ji Hye is scary.

2202
01:23:51,346 --> 01:23:52,546
She'll glare through the bags.

2203
01:23:52,546 --> 01:23:54,476
Her eyes are so fierce.

2204
01:23:54,646 --> 01:23:55,816
Is it the bag on the right?

2205
01:23:56,046 --> 01:23:58,176
- Right from my side? - Yes.

2206
01:23:58,176 --> 01:23:59,846
- Is this one the bomb? - Yes.

2207
01:24:01,276 --> 01:24:03,846
(Could it be?)

2208
01:24:03,846 --> 01:24:05,106
- Good, good. - It's not in there.

2209
01:24:05,646 --> 01:24:06,816
Good?

2210
01:24:07,506 --> 01:24:08,606
Hurry up and change it.

2211
01:24:08,606 --> 01:24:10,506
I'll give you another chance.

2212
01:24:10,506 --> 01:24:11,706
Why are you giving her a chance?

2213
01:24:12,676 --> 01:24:15,206
I feel like I was too harsh on her before.

2214
01:24:15,206 --> 01:24:17,446
- Just give it to me. - I want to give you a chance.

2215
01:24:18,006 --> 01:24:20,276
- I'll give you a chance. - Just give me the bag.

2216
01:24:20,506 --> 01:24:21,876
Hold on.

2217
01:24:21,876 --> 01:24:24,606
- This makes it certain. - What is he saying?

2218
01:24:24,606 --> 01:24:26,376
I think you're the one that needs a chance.

2219
01:24:26,376 --> 01:24:28,206
- I'm giving Ji Hye a chance. - He's persistent.

2220
01:24:28,206 --> 01:24:29,706
- It's this bag for sure. - I'm sacrificing...

2221
01:24:29,706 --> 01:24:32,706
Se Chan. You're making me look pathetic.

2222
01:24:34,506 --> 01:24:36,106
I'll give you another chance.

2223
01:24:37,076 --> 01:24:38,946
- This one. - All right.

2224
01:24:38,946 --> 01:24:41,846
This will be amazing if there is a twist.

2225
01:24:41,846 --> 01:24:45,206
- There is another chance? - Yes.

2226
01:24:45,276 --> 01:24:47,046
Se Chan is good at things like this.

2227
01:24:47,606 --> 01:24:49,006
- Bomb. - Right?

2228
01:24:49,006 --> 01:24:51,106
Ji Hye, please open the bag to check.

2229
01:24:51,106 --> 01:24:52,476
- Please. - Se Chan.

2230
01:24:52,476 --> 01:24:54,746
- Se Chan. - Does it end here?

2231
01:24:54,746 --> 01:24:55,946
Open it slowly.

2232
01:24:55,946 --> 01:24:57,976
- Se Chan, right? - Please.

2233
01:24:57,976 --> 01:24:59,676
(The bag is being opened.)

2234
01:24:59,676 --> 01:25:03,506
(This is the final match to determine the losers.)

2235
01:25:03,506 --> 01:25:08,646
(What was in Se Chan's bag?)

2236
01:25:08,646 --> 01:25:09,646
(Pass)

2237
01:25:09,646 --> 01:25:10,976
Ji Hye passes.

2238
01:25:11,646 --> 01:25:13,546
(The balloon explodes.)

2239
01:25:13,546 --> 01:25:15,816
(Congratulations, Seok Jin.)

2240
01:25:19,006 --> 01:25:20,376
(Ji Hye and Jae Seok avoid getting penalty.)

2241
01:25:20,376 --> 01:25:21,546
I'm so happy.

2242
01:25:21,946 --> 01:25:23,046
I'm so happy.

2243
01:25:24,376 --> 01:25:25,446
Gosh.

2244
01:25:25,446 --> 01:25:26,706
(Their love is still strong.)

2245
01:25:26,706 --> 01:25:28,706
It was so amazing.

2246
01:25:28,706 --> 01:25:29,976
I'm so happy.

2247
01:25:29,976 --> 01:25:32,646
(It was a good move.)

2248
01:25:33,106 --> 01:25:34,316
I'm so happy.

2249
01:25:34,316 --> 01:25:35,676
(You need to meet a good master.)

2250
01:25:35,676 --> 01:25:38,976
Let's give a round of applause for Jang Do Yeon,

2251
01:25:39,006 --> 01:25:42,676
Joon Hyun, Ji Hye, Se Chan...

2252
01:25:42,676 --> 01:25:44,206
and Min ho.

2253
