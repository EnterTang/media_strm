1
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:02,961
发生什么事了
What happened?

2
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:04,529
那只海洋生物把它撞烂了
That sea creature rammed it.

3
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,632
它可不是只普通的海洋生物  孩子们
Not just any sea creature, boys.

4
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:09,601
它是一只玛尔波莎
That's a marposa.

5
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:11,503
什么  这不可能啊
What? That doesn't make any sense.

6
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:14,002
我和家人在旅途中遇见过一群玛尔波莎
My family and I saw a whole pod on the voyage here, 

7
00:11:14,003 --> 00:11:15,607
但它们很友善啊
but they were friendly.

8
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:18,109
它们哪里看着友善了
Does that look friendly to you?

9
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:20,679
不是  但  
No, but-- 

10
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,713
指挥中心
To the command center.

11
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:24,883
-我们必须制定一套攻击方案  -攻击
- We must devise a plan of attack. - Attack?

12
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:27,886
赫克特国王  我知道我只是一名新来的统治者
King Hector, I know I'm a new ruler,

13
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:29,654
但或许还有其它解决办法
but maybe there's another way.

14
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:32,023
只有一种办法能对付那种生物  艾莲娜
There's only one way to deal with a creature like that, Elena.

15
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,291
我的办法
My way.

16
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:35,960
也许我们应该再考虑一下  赫克特
Perhaps we should think this through, Hector.

17
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:37,162
让我来捋捋
So let me get it straight.

18
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:38,997
你这么说摆明就是不想要
What you're saying is you don't want

19
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:40,865
我那条无敌海上战船了
my new Sea Blaster ship.

20
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,834
我们开始策划攻击方案吧
Let's start planning that attack.

21
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:44,202
-多谢你的支持  -但我不知道
- Glad you agree. - But I don't know--

22
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,205
艾莲娜  你说过你的家人在附近
Elena, you said you had family nearby.

23
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:48,973
我是说过
I do.

24
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:51,076
那好  为什么你不去联系他们
Okay, why don't you check on them

25
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:51,976
确保他们此刻的安全呢
and make sure they're safe.

26
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:54,045
对  当然
Right. Of course.

27
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,498
很好  这下总算能安心开始策划我们的攻击了
Good. Now we can plan our attack in peace. 

28
00:11:56,499 --> 00:11:57,582
跟我来  小的们
Come on, boys.

29
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:06,991
噢  在那儿
Ooh, over there.

30
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:09,394
看到那些裂痕了吗  我想它很快就要孵化了
See those cracks? I think it might hatch soon.

31
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,229
伊莎贝尔
Isabel!

32
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,564
艾莲娜
Elena!

33
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,766
大家都还好吗
Is everyone all right here?

34
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:16,101
我们没事啊  怎么了
We're fine. Why?

35
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:18,536
一只玛尔波莎攻击了拉贾国王的船
A marposa attacked King Raja's ship.

36
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:20,705
不可能啊
That doesn't make any sense.

37
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:22,440
我的书上说它们是不伤人的
My book says they're harmless,

38
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:24,342
而且生活在远海  除非
and stay way out at sea, except...

39
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:26,111
除非什么
Except when?

40
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:28,947
除非玛尔波莎妈妈到岸上下蛋
When the female marposa comes to shore to lay her eggs.

41
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:32,283
书上说玛尔波莎宝宝离开母亲
It says here that baby marposas get very upset

42
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:34,119
就会感到非常不安
if they're separated from their mothers.

43
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:36,688
它们会因为害怕而四处拍打
They thrash around because they're scared.

44
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,890
甚至会变得很危险
They can even be dangerous,

45
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:41,192
但一旦它们找到了妈妈就会立刻安静下来
but they calm right down once they find their mom.

46
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:45,697
所以也许那只破坏客船的玛尔波莎
So maybe the marposa that destroyed the ship

47
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:48,066
是一只离开了妈妈的宝宝
was a baby separated from its mother.

48
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:50,101
一定发生在它孵化之后
It must've happened after it hatched.

49
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:54,105
因为当宝宝们跟着妈妈时
Because when the baby is with its mom,

50
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,741
它很快乐  就像那只一样
it's happy, like that one.

51
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:00,712
所以我们一定要找到那只玛尔泊莎的妈妈
So we have to find the marposa's mother.

52
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:02,447
但怎么找呢
But how?

53
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,149
它们通过口哨来交流
Hm. They communicate by whistling.

54
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:06,417
如果玛尔波莎妈妈在寻找它的孩子
If the mom is looking for her baby,

55
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:08,052
她就会发出哨声
she'd be whistling.

56
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:10,455
也许你的磁力喇叭可以帮我们定位到它
Maybe your magnaphone can help us locate her.

57
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,624
好主意  嘿  接着
Great idea. Here, take it.

58
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:15,693
但首先我得告知其它国王它只是个宝宝
But first I have to tell the other kings it's just a baby.

59
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:21,766
阿芒多  你看到那只玛尔波莎了吗
Armando, did you see the marposa?

60
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:26,004
它肯定看到了我
And it sure saw me.

61
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:32,977
我们会把那怪物诱出海面并抓住它  是的
We are gonna lure the creature out to sea and capture it, yes!

62
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,045
现在卸下绳索吧
Now let's cast off.

63
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,323
赫克特国王  等等
King Hector, wait!

64
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,158
你这么快就回来了
Oh, back so soon?

65
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,194
您必须停止进攻
You have to stop the attack.

66
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:51,830
我想那只玛尔波莎只是一只吓坏的宝宝
I think the marposa is just a scared baby.

67
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,364
只要我们帮它找到妈妈
If we help it find its mother,

68
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:54,999
它就会离开您的船
it'll leave your ships alone.

69
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,968
各就各位  把渔网安装好
Men, let's get that net set up.

70
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,703
您必须听我说  赫克特国王
You have to listen to me, King Hector.

71
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:00,939
不  你得听我的
No. You have to listen to me.

72
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:03,208
但您的所作所为是错的
But what you're doing is wrong.

73
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,944
拉兹潘  你认为我做错了吗
Larzipan, do you think I'm wrong?

74
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:07,645
-当然没有  -拉吉内托
- Of course not. - Rajinator?

75
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:10,014
您从未在任何事上犯过错
You've never been wrong about anything.

76
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,382
伯尼尼
Bonini?

77
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,954
我知道这件事我是对的  华金
I know I'm right about this, Joaquin.

78
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:17,856
你必须相信我
You have to believe me.

79
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:19,824
你想得到那条船  对吧  那你加不加入
You want that ship, don't you? Are you in or out?

80
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:22,694
我加入
I'm in.

81
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,229
艾莲娜  你加不加入
Elena, are you in or out?

82
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:25,997
我不做
I'm out.

83
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:28,066
我们走  斯凯勒
Let's go, Skylar.

84
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,904
-听到什么了吗  -还没
- Hear anything? - Not yet.

85
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:35,907
也许我们应该换一条路
Maybe we should go back the other way.

86
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:37,976
等等
Wait.

87
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,046
听到了吗
Do you hear that?

88
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,882
听着像是玛尔波莎的声音
Sounds like a marposa to me.

89
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:45,183
和那只宝宝的哨声一样
It's the same whistle as the baby.

90
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:46,818
一定是它妈妈
It must be the mother.

91
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,654
从那个小岛上传来的
It's coming from that little island.

92
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:51,756
我们去看看
Let's check it out.

93
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,261
在那里  它被卡在树根里了
There. She's trapped in those roots.

94
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:58,496
这就能解释为什么宝宝是单只的了
That would explain why the baby's alone.

95
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,340
根本挪不动
It won't budge.

96
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:11,276
你可以把它拉松开吗  斯凯勒
Do you think you can pull it loose, Skylar?

97
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,645
交给我吧  公主
You got it, princesa.

98
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:19,250
我是一只大力的飞虎
I am a mighty jaquin.

99
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,386
你折断不了我
You will not break me.

100
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:24,255
但我会折断你
I will break you!

101
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:28,159
嗷  要断了  要断了  要断了
Ow! Splinter, splinter, splinter!
