－ 别在饭桌上看报.
－ 我正在看呢! 我还没看完!
￡- Don't read at the table.
￡- l'm reading that! l didn't finish!

2
00:00:07,176 --> 00:00:09,386
不行!
No!

3
00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:12,473
还有,别再玩弄你的头发了.
And stop playing
with your hair.

4
00:00:12,515 --> 00:00:15,142
会让你的头发掉光的!
You're gonna make
it fall out!

5
00:00:15,184 --> 00:00:18,687
你不用担心我的头发了
因为我就要把剩下的头发剃光了!
You can stop worrying about my hair
'cause l'm going to shave the rest off!

6
00:00:18,729 --> 00:00:21,857
－ 什么?!
－ 没错, 我马上要剃光头了.
￡- What?!
￡- That's right, l'm shaving my head.

7
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:25,778
－ 哦,这也太傻了!
－ 这不是傻, 这是时尚.
￡- Oh that's asinine!
￡- lt's not asinine, it's hip.

8
00:00:27,821 --> 00:00:30,616
－ 嗨, 我们家没有牛奶了.
－ 你自己倒吧.
￡- Hey, we're out of milk.
￡- Help yourself.

9
00:00:30,658 --> 00:00:33,953
想听最新新闻吗?
你老爸想剃成光头了.
Want to hear the latest?
Your father wants to shave his head.

10
00:00:35,663 --> 00:00:38,332
你怎么不试试把把脑袋伸到车窗外面呢？
Why don't you just stick your head
out the car window?

11
00:00:42,461 --> 00:00:45,506
－ 我的剃须刀在哪里?
－ 行了, 坐下吧.
￡- Where's my razor?
￡- Oh sit down.

12
00:00:45,548 --> 00:00:47,550
我们不可以在这家里剃头.
We do not shave
our heads in this house.

13
00:00:47,591 --> 00:00:50,553
这是我的家
还有,这是我的头!
lt's my house
and my head!

14
00:00:50,594 --> 00:00:53,013
你那副样子，我可不愿意和你在一起.
l'm not going to be seen
with you like that.

15
00:00:53,055 --> 00:00:54,723
又抓住了个弱点了!
Another advantage!

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,561
我去把所有的剃须刀都藏起来.
l'm hiding
all the razors.

17
00:00:59,645 --> 00:01:01,647
你不会剃头的.
You're not going
to shave your head.

18
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:03,816
当然不会.
Of course not.

19
00:01:03,858 --> 00:01:06,527
我只是想看报纸.
l just want

20
00:01:16,558 --> 00:01:18,310

￡- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Give me a second.
￡- Okay.

23
00:01:26,985 --> 00:01:29,154
我的处女作还不错, 是吧?
Pretty good
for a first try, huh?

24
00:01:29,195 --> 00:01:31,656
文章的观点如何?
看明白我要阐述的想法了吗?
What about the point of it?
See the point l was trying to make?

25
00:01:31,698 --> 00:01:34,576
看到我正在煮的咖啡了吗? (与前句句式完全相同)
Do you see the coffee
l'm trying to make?

26
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:38,204
－ 行了, 去吧. 我马上就来.
－ 好的.
￡- Come on, go. l'll be right there.
￡- Okay. All right.

27
00:01:47,297 --> 00:01:49,424
嗯, 最近怎样?
So, how are you?

28
00:01:49,466 --> 00:01:52,218
其他人怎么样?
很高兴听听你的想法. 你怎么看的?!
How's everybody?
Glad to hear it. What do you think?!

29
00:01:57,474 --> 00:01:59,351
行.

30
00:02:00,685 --> 00:02:02,604
啊...
Ah...

31

你就要喝咖啡了.

我有个多么让你开心的朋友啊!

和我说说看吧!

－ 我喜欢这篇文章.
－ 是吗?
￡- l like it.
￡- Yeah?

36
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:17,285
是的. 我只是－－ 认为有些很小，很小的问题.
Yeah. l just￡-￡- l have some minor,
minor things.

37
00:02:18,662 --> 00:02:23,458
哦，老天, 我只能一辈子都作统计人员了.
Oh God, l'm gonna be
a stat guy for the rest of my life.

38
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,293
别这么说, 行不?
文章写得很好.
Stop it, all right?
lt's very good.

39
00:02:25,335 --> 00:02:27,796
别这么说!
Don't say that!

40
00:02:27,837 --> 00:02:30,173
什么? 你明白很好是什么意思么?
What? What do you think
very good means?

41
00:02:30,173 --> 00:02:32,175
就是很糟糕!
very bad!

42
00:02:33,802 --> 00:02:36,596
－ 你不是想听听我的意见?
－ 是的!

￡- Yes!

43
00:02:36,638 --> 00:02:38,765

44
00:02:38,807 --> 00:02:40,850
看看这些红色记号!
Look at all
the red marks!

45
00:02:40,892 --> 00:02:42,936
真是一连串的打击啊!
This is a mob hit!

46
00:02:42,978 --> 00:02:45,105
Andy, 如果你不是我的朋友,
Andy, if you weren't
my friend,

47
00:02:45,146 --> 00:02:48,483
－ 我会说, "这文章很棒," 然后就走开.
－ 行啊, 你那样做啊!
￡- l'd say, "lt's great," and walk away.
￡- Yes, do that!

48
00:02:50,652 --> 00:02:53,488
听好, 听好.
Listen, listen.

49
00:02:53,488 --> 00:02:55,949
什么是男人和男孩的区别
What separates
the men from the boys

50
00:02:55,991 --> 00:02:58,410
那就是是否能够听得进去别人的意见,
is the willingness
to take notes,

51
00:02:58,451 --> 00:03:00,495
重写，让它变得更好.
rewrite and make
it better.

行吗?
Okay?

00:03:01,746 --> 00:03:05,500
我把最重要的地方告诉你
(key to the mint,一匹非常出名的赛马).
l'm giving you the key
to the mint here.

54
00:03:07,127 --> 00:03:09,546
好吧.
All right.

55
00:03:09,546 --> 00:03:11,214
开始吧,
我能接受.
Go ahead,
l can take it.

56
00:03:11,256 --> 00:03:13,842
我很想得到指点.
把关键得地方告诉我吧.
l want it.
Give me the key to the mint.

57
00:03:15,552 --> 00:03:17,304
行啊.
你看, 就这里,
All right.
Look, right here,

58
00:03:17,345 --> 00:03:18,680
这里有点重复了.
you get a little
repetitive.

59
00:03:18,722 --> 00:03:20,098
哦! 哦!
Oh! Oh!

60
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,976
我明白了, 我明白了, 我明白了, 我明白了!
我明白了, 谢谢!
l get it, l get it, l get it, l get it!
l get it, thanks!

61
00:03:23,018 --> 00:03:25,020
行,
现在看看这里－－
Okay,
now here￡-￡-

62
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:27,188
还有?!
There's more?!

63
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,983
－ 是的.
－ 我们能不能休息一下?
￡- Yeah.
￡- Can we take a break?

64
00:03:30,025 --> 00:03:32,485
我才刚刚开始呢.
你不是很想听我的意见吗?
l'm just getting started.
Don't you want to hear this?

65
00:03:32,527 --> 00:03:34,654
我只是需要休息一下.
l just need a moment.

66
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:44,164
－ Andy.
－ 我要休息一会儿!
￡- Andy.
￡- l said a moment!

67
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:52,672
－ 嗨, Deb, 我的牙刷放哪里去了?
－ 我把旧牙刷扔掉了.
￡- Hey, Deb, where's my toothbrush?
￡- l threw the old ones out.

68
00:03:52,714 --> 00:03:55,842
今天我带孩子们去看牙医了，
然后买了一大把新牙刷.
l got a bunch of new ones when
l took the kids to the dentist today.

69
00:03:55,884 --> 00:03:59,346
－ 那么那一把是我的?
－ 红的那把.
￡- So which one's mine?
￡- The red.

70
00:03:59,387 --> 00:04:01,806
我不想要红的!
l don't want to be red!

71
00:04:03,016 --> 00:04:05,727
那就拿蓝的吧.
Take the blue one.

72
00:04:06,811 --> 00:04:09,564
蓝的那把是湿的.
The blue one is wet.

73
00:04:09,606 --> 00:04:11,232
我刚刚用过.
l just used it.

74
00:04:12,442 --> 00:04:14,069
恶心!
Ew!

75
00:04:15,111 --> 00:04:17,072
你不知道, 我还用过放在那里的肥皂.
You know, l used
the soap in there too.

76
00:04:17,113 --> 00:04:19,199
不会是我的肥皂吧?
Not my soap?

77
00:04:20,241 --> 00:04:22,577
我都没有自己的卫生用品了.
l have no toiletries.

78
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:26,247
行了,
就这样吧?
Would you please,
all right?

79
00:04:26,289 --> 00:04:29,042
今天在牙医那里，
我不得不应付我们的三个疯小孩.
l already had to deal with three
maniac kids at the dentist today.

80
00:04:29,084 --> 00:04:31,419
最后，我都要用上奴佛卡因(一种局部麻醉剂)了.
By the end of it
l needed the Novocain.

81
00:04:31,461 --> 00:04:33,964
别相信 Geoffrey.
Couldn't believe Geoffrey.

82
00:04:34,005 --> 00:04:35,757
哎, 我今天一样过得很糟.
Yeah well, l had
a bad day too, okay?

83
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:37,592
我不得不和Andy讨论他的文章.
l had to talk to Andy
about his article.

84
00:04:37,634 --> 00:04:41,304
哦，那文章一定很烂－－
Oh well, that must
have been awful￡-￡-

85
00:04:41,346 --> 00:04:45,475
坐下来和一个成年人讨论. 哎呀!
sitting and talking
with an adult. Jeez!

86
00:04:45,517 --> 00:04:48,770
－ Michael坐到了椅子上－－
－ 真糟糕.
￡- Michael gets into the chair￡-￡-
￡- lt was awful.

87
00:04:48,812 --> 00:04:50,772
你不知道Andy多想成为作家.
You know how Andy wants
to be a writer.

88
00:04:50,772 --> 00:04:54,025
－ 所以我要帮助他.
－ 我正要跟你说些事情呢.
￡- So l gotta help him.
￡- l'm trying to tell you something here.

89
00:04:54,067 --> 00:04:57,070
行, 但是你不知道,
我读了他的作品
Okay, but you know,
l read his stuff

90
00:04:57,112 --> 00:04:58,571
然后我得开始思考,
and then l got
to think about it,

91
00:04:58,613 --> 00:05:01,908
然后我要对他的烂文章做些笔记.
and then l gotta make notes
on his stupid thing.

92
00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:05,745
也许这取决于你的态度.
Maybe it was your attitude.

93
00:05:05,745 --> 00:05:08,373
什么态度?
What attitude?

94
00:05:08,415 --> 00:05:11,084
"他的烂文章"?
"His stupid thing"?

95
00:05:11,126 --> 00:05:13,295
你不是把他的作品称为烂文章吗?
Did you call his article
a stupid thing?

96
00:05:13,336 --> 00:05:16,047
没有对他这么说.
跟他说的时候, 我说文章写得很好.
Not to him.
To him, l said it was very good.

97
00:05:16,047 --> 00:05:20,093
－ 我的老天.
－ 怎么了?
￡- Oh God.
￡- What?

98
00:05:20,135 --> 00:05:23,096
很好? 嗯, 我明白你的很好是什么意思了.
very good? Hmm, yeah, l know
what very good means.

99
00:05:23,138 --> 00:05:26,516
昨晚你对我做的炒菜是怎么评价的?
What'd you said
about my stir-fry last night?

100
00:05:26,558 --> 00:05:28,768
我说很好啊.
That was very good.

101
00:05:28,768 --> 00:05:31,938
－ 嗯－好.
－ 是啊.
￡- Mmm￡-good.
￡- Yeah.

102
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,357
很好的尝试.
我刚刚想说
Nice try.
l'm just saying

103
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:36,818
听到你的意见，可能对Andy来说非常重要,
it probably meant a lot
to Andy to get your feedback,

104
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,154
你可以对Andy更加友善一些.
and maybe you could have been
a little bit nicer.

105
00:05:39,195 --> 00:05:42,324
哎, 当时你不在那里.
我可是很友好的.
Hey, you weren't there.
l was very nice.

106
00:05:42,365 --> 00:05:44,326
我尝试给他指出文章的关键问题.
l tried to give him
the key to the mint.

107
00:05:45,869 --> 00:05:48,455
关键问题?
The key to the mint?

108
00:05:48,455 --> 00:05:50,415
你不会那么说吧,
是吧?
You didn't say that,
did you?

109
00:05:50,457 --> 00:05:52,042
这只是一种表达方式而已.
lt's an expression.

110
00:05:53,043 --> 00:05:55,962
哦, 那你就了解
Oh, and you are the keeper

111
00:05:56,004 --> 00:05:58,632
了解所有的关键问题?
of the key to the mint?

112
00:06:00,216 --> 00:06:02,385
不, 我－－
No, l￡-￡-

113
00:06:02,427 --> 00:06:04,929
我恰好了解其中的一个关键问题而已.
l happen to have
one of the keys.

114
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:08,308
－ 听着, 我是很友好的.
－ 这就是你当时所用的语气?
￡- Listen, l was very nice.
￡- ls that the tone you used?

115
00:06:08,308 --> 00:06:10,769
－ 没有什么语气不语气的.
－ 这肯定就是当时你的语气!
￡- There was no tone.
￡- There's tone right there!

116
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,897
对, 和你说话我的确用的这样的语气啊.
Yes, with you l'm having
tone right now.

117
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:15,398
行了吧?
Okay?

118
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,318
但是和Andy说话的时候， 我可是很友好的.
我很善解人意的.
But with Andy, l was very nice.
l was very understanding.

119
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,947
很有耐心.
然后他大喊大叫，让我很尴尬.
very patient.
And then he embarrasses me by crying.

120
00:06:21,988 --> 00:06:25,075
你让他大叫了?!
You made him cry?!

121
00:06:25,116 --> 00:06:27,327
－ Ray!
－ 他没有大叫，没有大叫.
￡- Ray!
￡- He wasn't crying crying.

122
00:06:27,369 --> 00:06:30,997
他只是有点呼吸困难.
He was just kind of breathing hard
and shuttering.

123
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,877
－ 每个人都看着我们.
－ 哦, 真为你们遗憾
￡- Everybody's looking at us.
￡- Oh, l'm so sorry

124
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,090
你不得不坐到你的大喊大叫的朋友旁边.
you had to sit next
to your crying friend.

125
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:41,716
听着...
Listen...

126
00:06:41,758 --> 00:06:43,927
看着别人痛苦，自己也很难受的
it's a lot harder to watch
the person in pain

127
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:46,805
要比那人更加难受.
than it is to be
the person in pain.

128
00:06:48,223 --> 00:06:51,518
我在干活的时候，你也对我说过这话.
You said that to me
when l was in labor.

129
00:06:55,021 --> 00:06:56,982
你那时在尖叫.
You were screaming.

130
00:06:58,525 --> 00:07:00,568
你听我这么说了，
真让我吃惊.
l'm surprised
you heard that.

131
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,160
可怜的Andy.
Poor Andy.

132
00:07:09,202 --> 00:07:12,372
你想想他为什么把他的文章给你看?
Why do you think
he gave you his article?

133
00:07:12,414 --> 00:07:14,708
因为我是傻瓜啊.
Because l'm a sucker.

134
00:07:14,749 --> 00:07:17,585
因为他敬仰你，尊重你
Because he looks up to you
and respects you

135
00:07:17,627 --> 00:07:20,463
而且无论你说什么，他都会听的.
and whatever you say
to him he's going to listen to.

136
00:07:20,505 --> 00:07:23,758
嗯, 但是当我和他说，别哭了，他并没有听我的啊.
Yeah, he didn't listen
when l told him to stop crying.

137
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,636
听着, 你在这一行已经非常成功了
Listen, you are
very successful

138
00:07:26,636 --> 00:07:28,388
而他只是刚刚起步,
and he's just
starting out,

139
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,557
你一定要尝试改变你的态度
and you really have to try to go
out of your way

140
00:07:30,557 --> 00:07:34,019
去鼓励他，要温和点d.
to be encouraging
to him and kind.

141
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,104
你要理解别人
You've got to understand
that other people

142
00:07:36,146 --> 00:07:38,106
也有自己的感情.
have feelings too.

143
00:07:39,816 --> 00:07:41,943
行啊!
All right!

144
00:07:47,657 --> 00:07:51,286
现在我可以告诉你今天发生在我身上的事情了吗?
Now can l finish telling you
what happened to me today?

145
00:07:51,328 --> 00:07:53,747
－ 今天你遇到什么事情了?
－ 看牙医的事情!
￡- What happened to you today?
￡- At the dentist!

146
00:07:53,788 --> 00:07:56,166
嗯, 好的.
行, 行, 行, 说吧.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, go.

147
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:59,085
Michael做到了椅子上，
但是其他两个孩子争着想当第一个.
Michael gets in the chair
and the other two want to get in first.

148
00:07:59,127 --> 00:08:01,296
这时他们就开始打架了，所以Gibbons医生
That's when the fighting
starts, so Dr. Gibbons

149
00:08:01,338 --> 00:08:03,048
试着开动了噗噗玩具火车.
tries to turn on
the choo￡-choo train.

150
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:04,799
这时Geoffrey踢了医生一脚!
That's when Geoffrey
kicks him!

151
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:07,969
他们都开始尖叫－－
小孩们，医护人员-Gibbons医生.
They all start screaming￡-￡-
the kids and Dr. Gibbons, the hygienist.

152
00:08:08,011 --> 00:08:10,680
－ 哦， 别这样.
－ 就是这样的.
￡- Oh no.
￡- That's right.

153
00:08:10,722 --> 00:08:12,515
哦, 不会是这样的.
No, not that.

154
00:08:12,557 --> 00:08:15,143
我下周正要去看牙医呢.
l have a dentist
appointment next week.

155
00:08:20,732 --> 00:08:22,233
怎么了?
What?

156
00:08:22,275 --> 00:08:24,486
我正在听呢!
l listened!

157
00:08:27,155 --> 00:08:29,324
－ 嘿!
－ 嘿!
￡- Hey!
￡- Hey!

158
00:08:29,366 --> 00:08:32,035
－ 我想和你谈谈文章的事情.
－ 好的.
￡- l want to talk about the article.
￡- Oh yeah, listen.

159
00:08:32,077 --> 00:08:34,037
嗨, 上个星期我给你提出我的意见的时候,
Listen, last week
when l gave you the notes,

160
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:37,248
我想我可能没有切实考虑的你的...
l think maybe l wasn't
really thinking about your...

161
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,042
感情诸如此类的.
feelings or whatever.

162
00:08:39,084 --> 00:08:41,044
不. 不. 不.
No. No. No.

163
00:08:41,086 --> 00:08:43,630
我想谢谢你.
我没有很好地接受你的意见.
l wanted to thank you.
l didn't take it very well.

164
00:08:43,672 --> 00:08:45,840
不, 不, 不,
你做得很好.
No, no, no,
you were fine.

165
00:08:45,882 --> 00:08:47,801
还有，你的文章的确写得很好.
And your article's
really good.

166
00:08:47,842 --> 00:08:50,261
我想告诉你应该坚持写下去
And l wanted to tell you
that you should stick with it

167
00:08:50,303 --> 00:08:53,390
－ 我会尽我所能来帮助你.
－ 我有个好消息.
￡- and l'll help you however l can.
￡- Here's the good news.

168
00:08:53,431 --> 00:08:56,017
你不用帮我了.
《体育画报》买下我的文章了!
You don't have to.
"Sports lllustrated" bought it!

169
00:08:59,813 --> 00:09:01,606
什么?
What?

170
00:09:02,732 --> 00:09:04,693
我给他们投稿了，
并且他们也录用了.
l sent it over there
and they bought it.

171
00:09:04,734 --> 00:09:07,779
他们就要出版我的文章了!
你信不信?! 哈哈!
They're gonna print it!
Can you believe it?! Ha￡-ha!

172
00:09:07,821 --> 00:09:09,447
哈!
Yah!

173
00:09:12,701 --> 00:09:14,119
哇!
Wow!

174
00:09:15,453 --> 00:09:18,665
所以我想－－ Debra认为我不会鼓励别人.
So l guess￡-￡- Debra thought
l wasn't being encouraging.

175
00:09:18,707 --> 00:09:21,251
但是我想我所作的对别人还是有帮助的.
but l guess whatever l did
kind of helped.

176
00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:22,877
当然, 当然.
Yes, yes.

177
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,713
在某种意义上, 是的.
ln a way, yes.

178
00:09:26,381 --> 00:09:28,341
－ 什么意思?
－ 嗯...
￡- What do you mean?
￡- Well...

179
00:09:28,383 --> 00:09:31,928
我并没有完全接受你的意见.
l didn't exactly
take your notes.

180
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,847
我的意思是, 我回家后开始思考这件事情.
l mean, l went home
and l thought about it.

181
00:09:33,888 --> 00:09:36,099
我决定了，我喜欢我自己的写作方式，
然后我就投递出去了.
l decided l liked the way
l had it and l sent it.

182
00:09:41,354 --> 00:09:43,607
哦.
Oh.

183
00:09:44,608 --> 00:09:46,943
无法想象, 老兄.
lmagine that, man.

184
00:09:46,985 --> 00:09:49,738
但是还是要谢谢你.
你的意见非常好!
But thanks anyway.
Your notes were very good!

185
00:09:59,414 --> 00:10:02,167
所以你也就不再看报了?
So you're giving up
reading altogether?

186
00:10:03,627 --> 00:10:05,754
我还可以看谷类食品包装盒啊(指看包装盒上面的广告).
l still have
cereal boxes.

187
00:10:07,172 --> 00:10:10,801
除非Count Chocula突然降低它的标准
(Count Chocula是一种流行的早餐谷类食品).
Unless Count Chocula
suddenly lowers his standards.

188
00:10:12,302 --> 00:10:14,263
你能告诉我发生什么事情了?
Do you want to tell me
what's going on here?

189
00:10:14,304 --> 00:10:18,183
没什么. "体育画报"
以前办得很好, 现在成垃圾了.
Nothing. "Sports lllustrated"
used to be good, now it's bad.

190
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,437
他们现在已经没有可信度了,
也没有品位.
They have no credibility,
no taste.

191
00:10:23,814 --> 00:10:26,733
哦, Ray. 是不是"体育画报"
又给你退稿了?
Oh, Ray. Did "Sports lllustrated"
reject you again?

192
00:10:30,362 --> 00:10:31,863
没有.
No.

193
00:10:31,905 --> 00:10:34,449
事实上是, 我为能被他们退稿而感到高兴,
As a matter of fact, l'm proud
of those rejections now,

194
00:10:34,491 --> 00:10:37,327
因为这份报纸是业余级别的.
'cause that rag is
amateurville Jack.

195
00:10:38,745 --> 00:10:40,372
他们发表了Andy的文章.
They're publishing
Andy's thing.

196
00:10:40,414 --> 00:10:43,041
噢, 很棒啊!
Oh, that's great!

197
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,460
不, 不是这样的!
No, it's not!

198
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,631
但是Ray, 你应该感到高兴啊.
我的天哪!
But Ray, you should be happy.
Oh my gosh!

199
00:10:49,673 --> 00:10:51,675
因为你帮助了他啊.
'Cause you helped him.

200
00:10:56,513 --> 00:11:00,225
哦, 哦, 哦.
Oh, oh, oh.

201
00:11:00,267 --> 00:11:03,061
他没有接受你的修改意见吧，是么?
He didn't take
your notes, did he?

202
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,277
Ray...
Ray...

203
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:13,822
他怎么能没有理会你的关键要点，还能发表文章的?
how did he get into
the mint without your key?

204
00:11:18,201 --> 00:11:20,787
他认识看门人(指审稿人员).
He knows the janitor.

205
00:11:23,874 --> 00:11:26,251
你都不为他的成功感到高兴.
You can't even
enjoy his success.

206
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:29,421
我感到很高兴,
行了吧?
l'm enjoying it,
okay?

207
00:11:29,421 --> 00:11:32,883
只是, 在那篇垃圾文章发表在 "体育画报"以后
Just, when that piece of crap
comes out in "Sports lllustrated,"

208
00:11:32,924 --> 00:11:35,177
Andy会变得让人难以忍受.
Andy's gonna be
impossible.

209
00:11:35,218 --> 00:11:36,970
因为他可能会认为自己已经是一个真正的作家了?
'Cause he might think
he's a real writer?

210
00:11:37,012 --> 00:11:38,305
是的.
Yeah.

211
00:11:38,347 --> 00:11:40,307
－ 他可能会变得自满自大.
－ 对的.
￡- And he might get full of himself.
￡- Right.

212
00:11:40,349 --> 00:11:42,643
他会认为自己已经写得和你一样好了.
And he might think
he's as good as you.

213
00:11:45,687 --> 00:11:47,773
－ 你不懂的.
－ 我懂啊.
￡- You don't understand.
￡- l understand.

214
00:11:47,814 --> 00:11:50,484
今天是属于Andy的
而不是属于你的.
Today was all about Andy
and it wasn't about you.

215
00:11:50,484 --> 00:11:51,944
－ 不, 不, 不, 不.
－ 是的.
￡- No, no, no, no.
￡- Yeah.

216
00:11:51,985 --> 00:11:54,488
行了, 承认吧.
你有点以自我为中心了.
Come on, admit it.
You're a little self￡-centered.

217
00:11:55,822 --> 00:11:58,075
以自我为中心?!
Self￡-centered?!

218
00:11:59,451 --> 00:12:02,955
是的, 你所看到的
都是他的好消息对你的影响.
Yeah, all you can see
is how this news affects you.

219
00:12:02,996 --> 00:12:06,208
我可以告诉你些事情吗?
你并不是只对Andy这样的.
And can l tell you something?
This isn't just with Andy.

220
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,546
－ 此话怎讲啊?
－ 就是我们说的lt's coming from those of us
￡- Where is this coming from?
￡- lt's coming from those of us

221
00:12:11,588 --> 00:12:14,424
我们这些围绕着你转的人说的.
orbiting around you.

222
00:12:19,096 --> 00:12:20,764
你认为
我以自我为中心?
You think
l'm self￡-centered?

223
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:23,392
我? 我? 我?
Me? Me? Me?

224
00:12:25,894 --> 00:12:28,814
你知道我－－
我工作努力.
You know l￡-￡-
l work hard.

225
00:12:28,855 --> 00:12:31,400
我努力来挣足够的钱来养活我们全家.
l try to make enough money
to feed this family.

226
00:12:31,441 --> 00:12:33,527
我不得不忍受那些来咨询我建议的朋友们
l have to put up with friends
who ask my advice

227
00:12:33,568 --> 00:12:35,320
然后他们又不听我提出的建议.
and then ignore
what l tell them.

228
00:12:35,362 --> 00:12:37,948
－ 爸爸!
－ 我还得忍受拥塞的交通.
￡- Daddy!
￡- Then l put up with traffic.

229
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,117
－ 然后我还得回家...
－ 爸爸!
￡- Then l have to come home...
￡- Daddy!

230
00:12:40,158 --> 00:12:42,077
...向妻子解释我自己
...and explain
myself to a wife

231
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:44,538
－ 因为她认为我是以自我中心的...
－ 爸爸!
￡- who thinks l'm self￡-centered...
￡- Daddy!

232
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:47,749
...这让我觉得－－
我听到了!
...which makes me think￡-￡-
l hear her!

233
00:12:49,876 --> 00:12:51,336
怎么了, 宝贝?
What is it, honey?

234
00:12:51,378 --> 00:12:54,339
我有1 ,000 美分了.
l have 1 ,000 pennies.

235
00:12:58,218 --> 00:13:01,471
你没看到爸爸正在和妈妈说话吗, 小宝贝?
Did you see that Daddy
was talking, sweetie?

236
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,645
我以后再看你的硬币, 好吗?
And l would love to see
those pennies later, okay?

237
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,650
啊哈?!
Huh?!

238
00:13:22,534 --> 00:13:24,036
不许看报.
No reading.

239
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,918
嘿, 嘿,你现在在干什么?
Hey, hey, what are you
doing there?

240
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,212
我正在切一块英国松饼.
l'm cutting
an English muffin.

241
00:13:34,254 --> 00:13:36,340
不能切.
你该用叉子.
You don't cut it.
You use a fork.

242
00:13:36,381 --> 00:13:38,675
你不会是用叉子来切东西吗.
You don't use a fork
to cut things.

243
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:41,553
－ 不是切, 是分割.
－ 什么?
￡- Not to cut, to split.
￡- What?

244
00:13:41,595 --> 00:13:44,181
对的, 在那边的包装纸上就是这么说的. 看看吧.
Yeah, it says it right
on the wrapper there. Look at it.

245
00:13:44,222 --> 00:13:47,601
用叉子分割.
叉子! 用叉子!
Fork split.
Fork! With a fork!

246
00:13:49,186 --> 00:13:52,689
这只是说他们在工厂是用叉子来分割的.
All that means is they've split
it with a fork at the factory.

247
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:55,108
如果他们在工厂就用叉子分割的话
那么松饼就应该已经是被分割好的了的
lf they split it at the factory
it'd be open already

248
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,444
我也就没有必要对你说这些了!
and l wouldn't
have to talk to you!

249
00:13:57,486 --> 00:13:59,696
你到底要不要吃这个?
You want this or not?

250
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,949
现在不吃. 看看你用餐刀干了些什么吧!
Not now. Look what you've done
with your knife!

251
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,909
你不仅把原来的裂缝弄坏了,
Not only have you killed
the crannies,

252
00:14:03,951 --> 00:14:05,911
还把它们挤到了角落里!
you smooshed them
into the nooks!

253
00:14:07,287 --> 00:14:09,289
真恨不得一巴掌把你扇到角落里.
l'm gonna smoosh you
into a nook.

254
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,335
－ 嘿.
－ 嗨, 亲爱的.
￡- Hey.
￡- Hi, dear.

255
00:14:13,377 --> 00:14:15,879

￡- Want an English muffin?
￡- Don't do it, it's cut!

256
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,881
别说了!
Raymond,
Oh stop!
Raymond,

257
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:21,426
他们在包装盒上写着, 用叉子分割,
when they say on
the box, fork split,

258
00:14:21,468 --> 00:14:23,971
这不就是说，他们已经帮你用叉子分割过了?
doesn't that mean they've started
it for you already?

259
00:14:24,012 --> 00:14:25,806
比如说在工厂
用叉子分割?
Like in the factory
with a fork?

260
00:14:31,478 --> 00:14:33,981
你有没有用过的牙刷吗?
Do you have any
unopened toothbrushes?

261
00:14:34,022 --> 00:14:36,608
－ 当然有. 你要一只牙刷?
－ 是的, 我要－－
￡- Oh course. You need a toothbrush?
￡- Yeah, l need￡-￡-

－ 对的.
￡- A blue medium, right?
￡- Right.

263
00:14:38,819 --> 00:14:41,947
－ Robby!
－ 妈, Robby已经搬走了t.
￡- Robby!
￡- Ma, Robby moved out.

264
00:14:41,989 --> 00:14:46,076
－ 什么事, 妈?
－ 他还是要来洗衣服的.
￡- What, Ma?
￡- He still has to do laundry.

265
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,161
Robby, 到橱柜
Robby, go
into the cabinet

266
00:14:48,203 --> 00:14:51,623
去帮你哥哥拿个新的蓝色中等硬度的牙刷出来.
and take out a new blue medium
toothbrush for your brother.

267
00:14:51,665 --> 00:14:55,460
蓝色中硬牙刷是我的.
我一直是用蓝色中硬牙刷的.
The blue mediums are mine.
l'm taking them with me.

268
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,880
Robby, 听我说, 帮你哥哥拿个蓝色中硬的牙刷出来
Robby, l said, get a blue medium
toothbrush for your brother

269
00:14:58,922 --> 00:15:00,882
快点拿出来吧!
and bring it out
right now!

270
00:15:00,924 --> 00:15:02,843
好吧!
All right!

271
00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:08,098
我不会吃它了!
l am not eating that!

272
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,100
吃这该死的松饼吧.
Eat that damn muffin.

273
00:15:13,228 --> 00:15:15,147
我是不是在不恰当的时间来找你了啊?
Am l catching you
at a bad time here?

274
00:15:15,188 --> 00:15:18,191
没有, 亲爱的, 我们正在吃早饭.
No, dear, we're just
having breakfast.

275
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,698
给你吧.
Here you go.

276
00:15:25,907 --> 00:15:27,576
这是黄色的.
That's yellow.

277
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,706
－ 哦.
－ 妈!
￡- Oh.
￡- Ma!

278
00:15:32,748 --> 00:15:35,584
我说拿个蓝色的牙刷的, Robby!
l said a blue
toothbrush, Robby!

279
00:15:35,626 --> 00:15:37,836
为什么一定要是蓝色的?
Why does it have
to be blue?

280
00:15:37,878 --> 00:15:40,255
因为我就要蓝色的.
Because that's
what l wanted.

281
00:15:40,297 --> 00:15:43,592
要是别人也想要呢，怎么办?
What about what
somebody else wants?

282
00:15:43,634 --> 00:15:46,511
你有否为别人考虑过?
Do you ever think
about anyone else?

283
00:15:48,472 --> 00:15:51,642
你是不是和Debra谈论过我?
Have you been talking
to Debra about me?

284
00:15:51,683 --> 00:15:55,187
没有, 我和Debra讨论过Andy的事情.
No, l've been talking
to Debra about Andy.

285
00:15:55,228 --> 00:15:58,774
我听说他的文章被
"体育画报"刊登了
l hear he got into
"Sports lllustrated."

286
00:15:58,815 --> 00:16:00,442
哇!
那是国家级报纸.
Wow!
That's national.

287
00:16:00,484 --> 00:16:02,986
哦, 是的,
爸爸.
Oh, yes, it is,
Daddy.

288
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:06,031
如果我说错了，你可以纠正我, Raymond,
Correct me
if l'm wrong, Raymond,

289
00:16:06,073 --> 00:16:09,117
但是这不就是你一辈子的梦想么
but hasn't that been
a lifelong dream of yours

290
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:11,411
在"体育画报"上发表文章?
to get into
"Sports lllustrated"?

291
00:16:12,746 --> 00:16:14,706
感觉如何啊?
How does it feel?

292
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:18,835
听着,我为Andy感到高兴, 行了吧?
Listen, l'm happy
for Andy, okay?

293
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:20,837
我并不是以自我为中心的.
l'm not self￡-centered.

294
00:16:22,464 --> 00:16:24,675
什么? 什么?!
你们在笑什么?
What? What?!
What are you laughing at?

295
00:16:24,716 --> 00:16:27,761
不以自我为中心?
嘿, 作为我的儿子，我爱你,
Not self￡-centered?
Hey, l love you like a son,

296
00:16:27,803 --> 00:16:31,098
但是你是一只总想引起别人注意的猪.
but you always were a pig
for attention.

297
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:33,976
－ 一只总想引起别人注意的猪 ?
－ 是的, 甚至你还是婴儿的时候
￡- A pig for attention?
￡- Yeah, even as a baby

298
00:16:34,017 --> 00:16:36,144
你会哭啊，哭啊，哭啊.

and cry and cry.

299
00:16:38,355 --> 00:16:40,899
看看我吧,
我肚子痛!
Look at me,
l got colic!

300
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,820
好了, 好了.
Yeah, yeah.

301
00:16:44,861 --> 00:16:46,947
每次当你进来的时候，是什么情形?
Or how about every time
you walk in the door?

302
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:48,740
你知道,
每次都是有理由的.
You know,
there's always a reason.

303
00:16:48,782 --> 00:16:51,159
"我结婚了."
"我有孩子了."
"l got married."
"l got kids."

304
00:16:51,201 --> 00:16:54,079
"我有一只蓝色中硬毛的牙刷了."
"l gotta have a blue
medium toothbrush."

305
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,498
－ 你说错了.
－ 嗯.
￡- You're wrong.
￡- Yeah.

306
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,376
什么时候你进来只为打个招呼的?
When do you ever come over
just to say hello?

307
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:02,170
我的招呼是隐含的.
The hello is implied.

308
00:17:02,212 --> 00:17:05,007
－ 妈, 你说我是你自我为中心的吗?
－ 你当然是啦, 亲爱的.
￡- Mom, am l self￡-centered?
￡- Of course you are, dear.

309
00:17:05,048 --> 00:17:06,967
啊哈!
Aha!

310
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:09,344
但是你有权这样.
But you have every
right to be.

311
00:17:09,386 --> 00:17:11,305
你是很特别的.
You're very special.

312
00:17:11,346 --> 00:17:14,349
我们走吧.
都上船吧!
Here we go.

你既英俊,

You are handsome,
you are charming, you're successful.

314
00:17:19,813 --> 00:17:23,525
你是优秀的父亲
还是英俊的儿子.
You're a marvelous father
and a beautiful son.

315
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:26,778
你很想知道，你是怎么变得以自我为中心的吧.
And you wonder how you
turned out self￡-centered.

316
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,323
你才是以自我为中心的.
You're the one
who's self￡-centered.

317
00:17:29,364 --> 00:17:32,784
我辛辛苦苦弄这些松饼，你甚至都都不想吃它
l slave over those muffins and you
don't even have the decency to eat it

318
00:17:32,826 --> 00:17:34,661
因为这些松饼的切片方法不正确!
because they're
not sliced right!

319
00:17:34,703 --> 00:17:38,540
你又怎么样?
我要用你的方式来吃我的松饼 !
How about you?
l got to eat my muffin your way!

320
00:17:38,582 --> 00:17:40,709
－ 我来吃松饼.
－ 别了, 你上楼去
￡- l'll eat the muffin.
￡- No, you go upstairs

321
00:17:40,751 --> 00:17:43,712
给你哥哥去拿蓝色牙刷把.
蓝色牙刷并不都是给你买的!
and get your brother a blue toothbrush.
They're not all for you!

322
00:17:43,754 --> 00:17:45,547
你在说什么啊?
现在我是以自我为中心了?
What are you saying?
l'm self￡-centered now?

323
00:17:45,589 --> 00:17:47,924
你? 当然了!
You? Definitely!

324
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:50,886
"我不能在普通买衣服的地方买衣服!"
"l can't buy clothes
where normal people buy clothes!"

325
00:17:50,886 --> 00:17:54,473
"我要我自己的公寓."
"每个人都攻击我!"
"l need my own apartment."
"Everyone shoots at me!"

326
00:17:56,058 --> 00:17:59,561

－ 对，他是的.
￡- You're the one that's self￡-centered!
￡- Yes, he is.

－ 但是你也是的.
－ 谢谢. 嘿! 我现在明白了.
￡- But you are too.
￡- Thank you. Hey! l understand now.

328
00:18:04,232 --> 00:18:07,110
用黄色牙刷，我也不会死.
l can live with yellow.

329
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,405
再见是暗示出来的!
The goodbye is implied!

330
00:18:17,815 --> 00:18:20,401
嘿, "体育画报," 哈?
Hey, "Sports
lllustrated," huh?

331
00:18:20,442 --> 00:18:23,237
别提那
"体育画报"了
Forget about
"Sports lllustrated."

332
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:25,239
他们把我的文章完全重写了.
They rewrote
my whole article.

333
00:18:26,657 --> 00:18:28,909
－ 整篇文章?
－ 整篇文章.
￡- The whole thing?
￡- The whole thing.

334
00:18:28,951 --> 00:18:31,579
但是他们刊载了.
所以他们肯定喜欢其中的某些东西.
But they bought it.
So they must have liked something.

335
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:35,332
很明显，他们喜欢是因为这篇文章是关于体育的.
Apparently they liked
that it was about sports.

336
00:18:35,374 --> 00:18:37,293
他们只是不喜欢我所用的词语
They just didn't like
the words l picked

337
00:18:37,334 --> 00:18:39,044
或者我文章的顺序.
or the order
l put them in.

338
00:18:40,337 --> 00:18:42,047
的确有问题.
That stinks.

339
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:44,091
但是他们需要这篇文章，对吧?
你做的很好
But who needs them, right?
You did a good job

340
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:46,802
你应该继续保持
我会帮助你的.

我应该听你的建议的.
Thanks, Ray.

lllustrated" guys, yeah?

346

他们有同样的问题?
They had

是的， 但是－－

你给他们说过
我给你提过建议?

349
00:19:07,865 --> 00:19:10,659
－ 说了点.
－ 嗯, 他们知道我是谁, 是么?
￡- Kind of.
￡- Yeah, they know who l am, right?

350
00:19:10,701 --> 00:19:13,204
我的意思是, 他们知道我是谁吗?
l mean, do they
know who l am?

351
00:19:13,245 --> 00:19:14,413
也许, 我不知道.
Maybe, l don't know.

352
00:19:14,455 --> 00:19:16,499
你提到我的时候，他们说了些什么?
What did they say when
you mentioned me?

353
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,877
我不确定, Ray.
我当时快哭了.
l'm not sure, Ray.
l was kind of crying.

354
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,421
哦.
真遗憾.
Oh yeah, yeah.
l'm sorry.

355
00:19:22,463 --> 00:19:25,716
你提到我的时候，你没有哭吧?
You weren't crying when you
mentioned me, were you?

356
00:19:44,693 --> 00:19:47,154
你究竟干了些什么?
What the hell
happened here?

357
00:19:48,155 --> 00:19:50,241
用叉子分割.
