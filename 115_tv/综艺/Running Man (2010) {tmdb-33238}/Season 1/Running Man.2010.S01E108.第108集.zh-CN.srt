我不想说出来的
I hate to tell you this

20
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,540
但你玩这游戏有点走火入魔了
but you might have an unhealthy obsession with this video game.

21
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:09,250
才没有  雷
No, I don't! Ray.

22
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,710
够了  卡米洛博士
That's enough, Dr. Camillo.

23
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,170
抱歉  克罗尼什博士
I'm... I'm sorry, Dr. Kronish.

24
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:13,250
如果你想继续为我工作
If you want to keep working for me,

25
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,380
就少损人  多擦点尿道
I suggest less tongue-lashing and more urethra-swabbing.

26
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,700
快去擦吧
Now off you go, swab, swab.

住在你儿时的家没有任何问题

任务是阻止他染上疱疹
The mission is to stop him from getting herpes,

32
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,210
让他当不成科学家
prevent him from becoming a scientist,

33
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,660
然后他就永远制造不出解药了
and then he never creates the cure.

34
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,880
我比舞胜出了

00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:48,610
时空穿梭装置和通往救世主的路就在这条隧道的那头
Through this tunnel lies the TTD and a path to our savior.

50

00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,720
当我们回到2017年
When we get to 2017,

55
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,960
是时候分糖吃了

我当然把它带上了

{\an8}2017年12月12日

83
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,690
我们为什么要这么做  你不是住在这吗
Why are we doing this, don't you live here?

84
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,990
是的  我住这儿
Yes, I do live here

85
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,090
但我不知道我父母是否在楼下
But I don't know if my parents are downstairs or not

86
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,530
所以我要去确认一下

你们就待在这  不要发出声音

I-I thought you were doing uh... the-the beach cleanup today.

没错  只不过忘拿我的拨火棍[扑克]

他们喜欢你自带装备

看我的"扑克脸"

拜托  儿子  这在海滩上可以迷死一片人
Come on, son, that kills down at the beach.

96
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,240
为什么墙上会挂着把枪

97
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,030
你什么意思  我们家一直有枪啊
What do you mean, we've always had a gun.

98
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,080
这是福特曼的房子

99

00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,250
不用  不用  不用  不用
No, no, no, no!

102
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,450
我...我只是试图想起来
No, I... I was just trying to remember

103
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,810
你是什么时候买的那个经典壁挂的
when did you get that classy wall mount?

104
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,420
这是你爷爷放上去的
That's the same one your grandpa put up.

105
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,750
我只是给它擦了点油
I just gave it a little oil.

106
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,170
爷爷持枪
Grandpa was a gun guy?

107
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,490
在登月之夜家里闯入流氓后
Hard not to be after those hooligans broke in here

108
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,760
很难不去配把枪
the night of the moon landing.

109
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,080
你知道那个故事
You know that story.

110
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,230
三个人
Three of them.

111
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,230
我永远都忘不了他们的脸
I'll never forget their faces.

112
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,870
-你忘不了吗  -几个小个子拉美人
- You won't? - Couple of little Latino fellas.

113
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,010

其中两个人是流浪汉
Well, two of them were vagrants

115
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,690
第三个是个孩子  看起来很害怕  好像他不想来
Third one was a child, scared, like he didn't want to be there.

116
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,980
总之在那之后  你爷爷去买了伊萨卡37霰弹枪
Anyway, right after that, Grandpa went out and got the old Ithaca 37.

117
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,480
感谢上帝我们没有需要用它的时候
Thank God we never had to use it.

118
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,650
我甚至不知道该怎么用
I'm not even sure how it works.

119
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,470
希望它没有上膛
Hope it's not loaded.

120
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,510
我们该出发了
Hey, we better get going.

121
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,560
拉马尔  到圣塔莫尼卡码头要花多长时间
Lamar, how long is it gonna take to get to Santa Monica Pier?

122
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,070
现在不堵车
The traffic is moderate.

123
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,340
我估计大概40分钟吧

124
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,630
-谢谢  拉马尔  -拉马尔
- Okay, thanks, Lamar. - Lamar?

125
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,110
亲爱的  你不必谢它的
Honey, you don't have to thank it.

126
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,270
不是"它"  是拉马尔·普锐斯
It's not an "It," It's Lamar Price.

127
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,290
不是吧
Oh no.

128
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,850
妈妈  我可以看下...
Hey, Mom, can I see that for just a...

129
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,100
谢谢
Thank you.

130
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,110

是黑果
It's a Blapple.

132
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,930
只有老年人才会叫它黑苹果
Only old people call it a Blackapple.

133
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,610
这话还是你说的
You told us that.

134
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,460
卧槽
Fuck.

135
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,920
我就是把手机落在那了
That's where I left my phone.

136
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,780
亲爱的  你确定你没事吗
Honey, are you sure that you're okay?

137
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,110
当然  我挺好的
Yeah, yeah, I am, I'm fine.

138
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,420
你们是不是得赶紧走了
Um, you guys should probably get goin'.

139
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,150
走吧  亲爱的  那些带沙子的避孕套
Let's go, honey, those sandy condoms

140
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,480
不会自己飞进垃圾桶的
aren't gonna pick themselves up.

141
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,180
没错  不会的  拜拜啦
Nope, they're not... all right, bye!

142
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,490
拜
Bye!

143
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,220
我们确实改变了一些事
Well, we changed stuff,

144
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,350
但不是我们想改变的...
just not the stuff we want...

145
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,730
我勒个去
Jesus fucking Christ!

146
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,130
你要去哪里
Hey, where are you goin'?

147
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,470
你们不希望我回避一下吗
Do you guys want some privacy?

148
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,990
不用  我们就是充个电
No, we're just chargin' up.

149
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,180
人们干这事的时候一般会选择没人的地方
This is just something that people typically do in private.

150
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,420
为什么
Why?

151
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,160
因为要跟很在乎的人
Because you do it with someone

152
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,340
才能这样做
who means something to you.

153
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,220
-不要停  -好
- Don't stop. - Okay,

154
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,880
那我就靠说话转移注意力吧
I'm just gonna try and talk through this.

155
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,970
所以我们没能阻止克罗尼什得疱疹
Um, so basically we didn't stop Kronish from getting herpes,

156
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,020
但是  我们确实改变了很多事
however, we did change things.

157
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,300
造成了剧烈的蝴蝶效应
Talking major ripples.

158
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,490
蝴蝶效应吗
Ripples?

159
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,470
对  蝴蝶效应
Ripples, ripples.

160
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,660
我们在1969年做的事
What we did in 1969

161
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,210
改变了现在的世界
has had an effect on the present day,

162
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,550
比如我爸现在有一把枪
like my dad now owns a gun,

163
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,400
还有点种族歧视
and is also a little bit racist

164
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,930
现在这玩意叫黑果
and it's probably my fault

165
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,860
估计也是我造成的
that this is now called a blaptop.

166
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,600
求你们停下  好吗
Can you please stop, please?

167
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,870
不行  我还没充满电
I can't, I'm not fully charged yet.

168
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,040
充什么电
Charged for what?

169
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,640
这是释放压力的标准步骤
It's a standard operating procedure to release tension.

170
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,670
左边向下两毫米
Two micrometers down to the left.

171
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,200
干得漂亮  士兵
Nice work, soldier.

172
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,900
即将满电  三  二  一
Fully charged in three, two, one.

173
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,500
太棒了  士兵
Yeah, fuck yeah, soldier!

174
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,570
要的就是这种状态
That is how you perform!

175
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:18,100
太好了  爽
Yes, fuck yes!

176
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,610
好的  压力释放完毕
All right, tension released.

177
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,600
准备杀敌
Ready to kill.

178
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,500
杀敌  杀谁
Kill, what?

179
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,650
克罗尼什
Kronish.

180
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,750
我们别无选择
It's our only option.

181
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,330
试过你的办法  但是失败了
We tried it your way and we failed.

182
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,310
惨败
Miserably.

183
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,180
不  不行  不能杀克罗尼什
No, no, no, no, you can't murder Kronish,

184
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,280
他现在还没有犯错
he hasn't done anything wrong yet.

185
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,330
《少数派报告》说的就是这个
That's the whole point of Minority Report.

186
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,260
我没听过这个报告
I'm unfamiliar with that report.

187
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,050
你需要我提醒你这件事的重要性吗
Do you need to be reminded of what's at stake here?

188
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,570
他创造了这些变异人
He's the father of these mutants.

189
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,850
你看着这些难道不生气吗
How can you look at that and not feel outrage?

190
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,320
还有  你怎么会有这个生化人玩偶
Also, why the fuck do you even have this tiny Biotic?

191
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,290
你是要救一个人  还是全人类
This is one man versus the fate of humanity.

192
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,870
我们要去实验室  然后杀掉克罗尼什
We're going to the lab and we kill Kronish.

193
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,740
等等  杀一个人要这么多武器吗
Whoa, you... you need all of that to kill one man?

194
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,570
很显然  在杀他之前
Well, obviously a lot of other people are gonna die

195
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,640
还得死很多人
to get to that one man.

196
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,790
战争牺牲品
Casualties of war.

197
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,320
他们死总比我们死强
Better them than us.

198
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,400
你也知道这是唯一的办法
You know this is the only way.

199
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,350
不  肯定还有其他办法
No, no, there has to be another way.

200
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,260
他们不是生化人
These are not Biotics.

201
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,770
他们是我的同事
These are people that I work with.

202
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,470
你能让我们靠近他吗
Can you get us close to him?

203
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,040
如果你能隔离他
If you can isolate him,

204
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,370
那其他人就没必要受伤了
then no one else has to get hurt.

205
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,770
抱歉  身为救世主并不代表你能救所有人
Sorry, being the savior doesn't mean you get to save everyone.

206
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,640
你能让我们进那栋大楼吗
Can you get us in the building?

207
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,700
悄悄进去肯定是不行的
Not without creating a huge scene.

208
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,870
而且有三层安保
And there's three layers of security.

209
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,920
我有工作证  都只能通过其中两层
I've got a badge and I can only get through two.

210
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,020
好吧  那你的任务很简单
Okay, then your job is simple.

211
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,460
把克罗尼什引出来
You just need to lure Kronish out there

212
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,720
然后我们杀他时你看不看都行
and then it's up to you whether you watch us kill him.

213
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,720
你应该看看
Oh, you should watch.

214
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,940
我们会把他变成一滩内脏
We're gonna turn him into a puddle of guts.

215
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:01,780
进去吧  别让抵御者失望  未来侠
Now go in there and make the Resistance proud, future Man.

216
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,900
这个计划不好  猎虎
This is a bad plan, Tiger.

217
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,360
我的感应雷足够炸倒这座大楼
I got enough sensor mines to drop this building.

218
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,320
你看他们的防护多弱
Look how weak those defenses are.

219
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,790
比如  护城壕沟在哪
I mean, where's the moat?

220
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,860
看到有放射性水陆两用车吗
You see any radioactive alligators?

221
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,740
-我是没看到  -不行  必须确保他死掉
- I don't. - No, we need a confirmed kill.

222
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,030
我穿越时空过来
I didn't travel through time

223
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,600
不是为了翻尸体堆找人的
to keep picking through piles of rubble for body parts.

224
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,120
准备就位吧
Now let's get into position.

225
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,580
未来侠大概还有
Future Man should be out in...

226
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,630
不到三根手指就出来了
less than three fingers.

227
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,380
走吧
Let's go.

228
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,630
好的
All right.

229
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,690
早上好  乔西
Morning, Josh.

230
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,000
卡尔  你好
Hey Carl, hey...

231
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,920
等等  雷去哪儿了
Hey, wait, where... where's Ray?

232
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,480
雷是谁
Who's Ray?

233
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,010
操  我把雷给弄没了
Fuck, I made Ray disappear.

234
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,620
该死的蝴蝶效应
God damn ripples.

235
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,720
有什么事吗
Um, can I help you?

236
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,820
请问  克罗尼什在里面吗
Yeah, is... is Kronish in there?

237
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,460
他不在卡米洛博士的办公室
Well, he's not in Dr. Camillo's office, no.

238
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,890
{\an8}斯图·卡米洛博士

239
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,290
他们还在吃合伙人早餐
They're still at their partners' breakfast.

240
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,600
合伙人  我是怎么做到的
Partners, how the fuck did I do that?

241
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,890
你做到了什么
How did you do what?

242
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,090
抱歉  你还好吗
Sorry, are you okay?

243
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,770
没事  就是...
Yeah, it's just...

244
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,770
你有没有哪天醒来
uh, have you ever had one of those days

245
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:36,540
觉得整个世界都很熟悉
where you wake up and the whole world is recognizable,

246
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,360
但是又完全不一样呢
but also really different?

247
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,900
你是说《怪诞星期五》那种呢
Mm, you mean like in Freaky Friday

248
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,510
还是《黑客帝国》那种
or a Matrix-type situation?

249
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,970
都不是  比较像是《回到未来》的结尾
No, more like the end of Back to the Future.

250
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,510
懂了  就是说平行现实
Oh, so it's like an alternate reality.

251
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,820
发现父母特别酷
Your parents are super cool,

252
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,630
而自家车库里突然多出一辆很酷的车吗
and all of a sudden you have this awesome new truck in your garage?

253
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:56,460
大概吧  或者说史蒂夫·乔布斯不存在
Sort of, or, like, Steve Jobs doesn't exist.

254
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,640
谁
Who?

255
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,760
你看
Exactly.

256
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:01,110
你觉不觉得那部电影严重忽略了
Don't you think that movie, like, really undersold

257
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,090
如果马蒂回到一个
how hard it would have been

258
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:05,650
他从没过过的生活该有多难吗
for Marty to come back to a life that he never lived?

259
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,390
我从来没那么想过
Guess I never thought about it like that.

260
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:11,390
我只是很想要那台芭比悬浮滑板
I just really wanted that Barbie Hoverport.

261
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,350
天啊
Oh my God.

262
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,450
真的很想要
Really wanted it.

263
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,750
他余生每一次交谈
He would have to fake his way

264
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,460
都得伪装演戏
through every conversation for the rest of his life.

265
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,700
算你走运
Well, lucky for you this is actually

266
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,290
这其实是我们第一次交谈
the first conversation that we've ever had,

267
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,390
所以你不用假装什么
so you don't have to fake your way through this.

268
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,700
也对
Uh, yeah.

269
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,430
对了  我是乔西
Uh, I'm Josh, by the way.

270
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,550
我知道
I know.

271
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,380
真的吗
You do?

272
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,470
求你了  斯图  别逼我做这个
Please, Stu, I beg you, don't make me do this.

273
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,730
这些焦点小组可能会很羞辱人
These... these focus groups can be humiliating.

274
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,200
振作一点  伊莱亚斯  这对公司有好处
Buck up, Elias, it's good for the company.

275
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,910
除非你不是以公司为重的人
Unless you're not a company man.

276
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,820
我当然是  斯图  但你知道我从来不爱出风头
I am, Stu, but you know I've never been a showman.

277
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,700
我  我讨厌成为别人关注的焦点
I... I hate being the center of attention.

278
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,340
你才不会成为别人关注的焦点
You're not gonna be the center of attention.

279
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,990
你嘴唇上那坨迷你千层面才会
That little mini lasagna on your lip is.

280
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,470
你看什么看  白痴
What are you looking at, butthead?

281
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,640
你的机会来了
There's your Biff.

282
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,870
对
Uh, yeah.

283
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,140
克罗尼什博士
Dr. Kronish,

284
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,340
我能问你个问题吗
can I ask you a question?

285
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:13,430
你到底是怎么染上疱疹的
How in the hell did you get herpes?

286
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,250
一切要从登月那晚说起
Well, it started the night of the moon landing.

287
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,870
输了一场斗舞让我当众蒙羞后
Being totally humiliated after losing a dance-off,

288
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:24,030
我立刻从兄弟会逃走
I was summarily run out of my fraternity.

289
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,720
我试着重拾自信
I tried to regain my confidence

290
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,910
踏上了遍布世界的性爱征程
by embarking on a sexual odyssey across several continents,

291
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,500
并且
and, well...

292
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,120
"上"了数不清的炮友
countless partners.

293
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,320
我很肯定就是这样染上疱疹的
I'm pretty sure that's how I got herpes.

294
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,770
好吧
Yeah.

295
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:41,610
克罗尼什博士  我...
Um, Dr. Kronish, I, uh,

296
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,970
我要带你出去看样东西
I need to show you something outside.

297
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:45,590
是什么
What is it?

298
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,160
是惊喜
It's a surprise.

299
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,880
我可喜欢惊喜了
Ooh, I love surprises.

300
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,080
太好了  你愿意跟我来吗
Great, you want to come with me?

301
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,830
我问你个事
Uh, look, let me ask you something.

302
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,300
你要带我去的那个地方冷吗
Will it be chilly where you're taking me?

303
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,530
挺冷的
Pretty chilly.

304
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,250
我们要去很久吗
Will we be gone long?

305
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,950
很久
Yeah, a long time.

306
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,710
等等  停一下
Stop, stop what you're doing.

307
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,020
我做不到
I... I can't do this.

308
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,360
把外套脱掉
Take... take off your coat.

309
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,320
到底要怎么样
What's it gonna be?

310
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,530
你有生命危险  知道吗
Your life is in danger, okay?

311
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,310
到底穿不穿外套
So coat or no coat?

312
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,770
不  听我说  克罗尼什博士
No, listen to me, Dr. Kronish.

313
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,780
有人想要你的命
There are people who want you dead.

314
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,020
你得离开这里  你得躲起来
You have to get out of here, you have to hide.

315
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,380
我保护不了你
I can't protect you.

316
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,930
你是在说支持动物权利的那些人吧
Oh, you're talking about those animal rights people.

317
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,450
他们已经揪着我好几年了
They've been after me for years.

318
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,060
我已经收到过将近两万次死亡威胁了
I must be nearing 20,000 death threats.

319
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,060
真的吗
Really?

320
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,560
你知道我们每年在这儿
Do you have any idea how many possums we kill

321
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,450
杀死多少只负鼠吗
at this facility annually?

322
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,560
数量惊人
Staggering numbers.

323
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,860
不  克罗尼什博士  这严重多了
No, Dr. Kronish, this is much worse.

324
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,800
这些人是训练有素的杀手
These people are trained killers,

325
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:47,720
他们不喜欢你
and they don't like you,

326
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,730
也不喜欢你的研究
and they don't like your research,

327
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:49,840
他们会竭尽所能
and they'll do anything they can

328
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,400
阻止研究成果流出市面
to prevent it from getting out there.

329
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,820
你必须躲起来
You have to disappear.

330
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,980
我绝不能那样做  福特曼
I could never do that, Futterman.

331
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,630
我的研究太重要了
My work is too important.

332
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,310
如果你死了
What good is your work...

333
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,750
你的研究还有什么用
if you're dead?

334
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,920
我感激你对我的关心
I appreciate your concern.

335
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,820
如果你那么担心的话
And if you're all that worried,

336
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,040
打这个电话
Call that number.

337
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,620
他们专门处理死亡威胁
They handle all my death threats.

338
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,580
找卡罗尔
Ask for Carol.

339
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,260
已经过了六根半手指了
It's been, like, six and a half fingers.

340
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,100
我们都知道救世主不会来了
We both know the savior's not coming.

341
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,520
不如直接把这栋楼给炸了吧
Let's just blow up the building.

342
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,460
不行
No.

343
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,240
我们得亲自动手
We're gonna have to do this ourselves.

344
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,100
当面杀了他
Up close and personal.

345
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,140
好了各位  我们现在要进去参加焦点小组了
Okay everybody! We're gonna go inside now for the focus group.

346
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,380
请在这儿排成一直线
So please form a single file line right here.

347
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,620
机会来了
Ratpot.

348
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,120
{\an8}克罗尼什实验室

349
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,650
你  排成这队形是要干什么
You. What is the nature of this formation?

350
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,980
我们是来参加焦点小组的
We're here for the focus group.

351
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,790
你没拿这传单吗
Didn't you get one of these?

352
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,780
运气太好了  克罗尼什
Double ratpot. Kronish!

353
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,090
{\an8}伊莱亚斯·克罗尼什博士亲临现场

354
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,880
弗利特伍德麦克乐队
Fleetwood Mac.

355
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,490
到后面排队
Back of the line.

356
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,330
你活得不耐烦了吗  小丑
You want to bleed, jester?

357
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,620
到后面排队
Back of the line.

358
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,850
算了
Save it.

359
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,250
低调一点
Low profile.

360
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:22,170
会长在口腔  生殖器  甚至肛门上
Oral, genital, even anal,

361
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,400
他们称之为单纯疱疹病毒
they call it herpes simplex,

362
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,530
但它一点不单纯
but there's nothing simple about it.

363
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,740
我是伊莱亚斯·克罗尼什博士
Um, I'm Dr. Elias Kronish,

364
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,600
我在为你们寻找解药
and I'm seeking the cure for you...

365
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,750
也为我自己
and for me.

366
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,000
有什么想法和感受吗
Thoughts, feelings?

367
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,510
已经连续第三遍了
That's the third one of these in a row.

368
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,610
我再也受不了了  我们已经进来了
I can't take it anymore... we're in the building,

369
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,730
-直接去找那个混蛋  把他灭了吧  -不行
- let's just go find the motherfucker and kill him. - No.

370
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,930
看这段视频让我不自在
Watching it made me uncomfortable,

371
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,960
可能是因为他也很不自在
I think because he was uncomfortable.

372
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,240
克罗尼什会来的  辛迪保证过的
Kronish will be here, Cindy promised.

373
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,690
我不信任辛迪
I don't trust Cindy.

374
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,540
她表面在笑  但她眼神很悲伤
She's smiling, but she has sad eyes.

375
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,100
对哦
Oh yeah.

376
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,520
还有其他人对克罗尼什博士有感想吗
Anyone else have thoughts on Dr. Kronish?

377
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,880
我鄙视他和他所拥护的一切
I despise him and everything he stands for.

378
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,580
你已经是第三次这么说了  知道了
That's the third time you've said that, noted.

379
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,570
他要是死了我还喜欢他多一点
I'd like him better if he died.

380
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,760
好吧
Okay.

381
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,280
还有其他人想看到克罗尼什博士死吗
Anyone else want to see Dr. Kronish die?

382
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,320
有
Yes.

383
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,010
这个嘛
Well...

384
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,290
你说过克罗尼什博士会来的
You said Kronish was gonna be here.

385
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,460
他人呢  辛迪
Where is he, Cindy?

386
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,800
我说过了  克罗尼什博士很忙
Again, Dr. Kronish is very busy.

387
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,790
不如我们来看下一条宣传片
Why don't we take a look at our next ad?

388
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,090
事先说明一下
Just want to say in advance,

389
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,460
在本片制作过程中  没有负鼠受伤
no possums were hurt in the making of this.

390
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,620
你们刚听到的声音
The sound you just heard

391
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,190
是负鼠射精的声音
is a possum ejaculating.

392
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,100
不如我们炸了这该死的大楼
Let's just blow up the fucking building.

393
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,030
干掉克罗尼什和剩下的这堆垃圾
Take out Kronish and the rest of this trash.

394
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:51,100
好  我只需要大家填完这个表格
Okay, I'm just gonna have you all fill out this form.

395
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,200
这真他妈操蛋
This is some fucking shit.

396
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,460
我们已经进来了  直接去干掉他吧
You know, we're in the building, let's just go.

397
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,290
好主意  指挥官
Brilliant idea, commander.

398
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,210
暴狼
Wolf.

399
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:00,190
不不不  谁也不能走
Oh, no, no, no. No one leaves.

400
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,710
真的吗
Really?

401
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,610
你要阻止我们吗  辛迪
You're gonna stop us, Cindy?

402
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,430
你真想这么干吗
You want to do that?

403
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,330
他们去哪儿了
Where did they go?

404
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,350
操
Shit.

405
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:22,400
-怎么了  -他们说好会
- What happened? - They promised they'd do a better job

406
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,670
更仔细检查来这里的人的
screening who comes to these things.

407
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,950
不要啊
Oh no.

408
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,270
他们去哪儿了
Where'd they go?

409
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:38,020

412
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,990
你要去哪儿
Where are you going?

413
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,180
我在找两个人
I'm looking for two people.

414
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,570
我也是  我在找史密斯博士和阿珀英格博士
Yeah, so am I, Dr. Smith and Dr. Apoyngo.

415
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,520
他们失踪了吗
Have they gone missing?

416
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,250
没失踪  只是演示迟到了
Missing, no, they're just late for a demo.

417
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,240
他们在三楼是吧
Okay, they're on three, right?

418
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,430
-对  -好的
- Yeah. - Okay.

419
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,130
不要死啊  阿珀英格
Oh, don't be dead, Apoyngo.

420
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,140
不要死啊  阿珀英格  不要死啊  阿珀英格
Don't be dead, Apoyngo, don't be dead, Apoyngo.

不要死啊  阿珀英格
Don't be dead, Apoyngo.

Good to greet you.

425
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,320
很高兴见到你
Good to greet you.

426
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,020
我们偷的这两件白大褂的主人没有
Those whitecoats we stole from don't have access

427
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,400
进入内部密室的权限
to the inner sanctum.

428
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,870
我们另找方法进去
We'll find another way in.

429
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,880
暴狼博士
Dr. Wolf.

430
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,420
相信我  克罗尼什在楼上
I'm telling you, Kronish is upstairs.

431
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,160
高价值目标总是藏在地下掩体里
High value targets are always in the subterranean bunkers.

432
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,480
我觉得这里不是这么回事
I don't think it works that way here.

433
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,430
你的工作不是思考
It's not your job to think,

434
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,710
你的工作是听从我的命令
it's your job to take orders from me.

435
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,660
这地方的防御不堪一击
This place isn't built for defense.

436
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,050
这是我见过的第一件武器
This is the first weapon I've seen,

437
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,290
还是挂在墙上当装饰品的
and it's mounted on the wall for decoration.

438
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,970
-猎虎  我的直觉...  -去你的直觉
- Tiger, my instincts... - Fuck your instincts.

439
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,360
沃多的宫殿里沃多在哪儿
Valdor's Palace, where was Valdor?

440
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,080
在地下的墓穴里
In the underground catacombs.

441
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,370
古丽加神庙里古丽加在哪儿
Temple of Gooliga, where was Gooliga?

442
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,990
在古丽加府邸
In the Gooligorium.

443
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,540
府邸在哪儿呢
And where is that?

444
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,610
在地心旁边
By the earth's core.

445
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,320
没有比那更地下的了
Doesn't get more underground than that,

446
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,810
是不是啊  小暴狼
now does it, Wolfie?

447
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,600
天啊
Jesus.

448
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,440
相信我
Trust me.

449
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,770
克罗尼什就在这
This is the way to Kronish.

450
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,800
我操
Oh, f...

451
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,420
该死的
Goddammit.

452
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,480
暴狼
Wolf.

453
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:52,150
自打第一天起你他妈的就瞧不起我
You've been underestimating me since day fucking one.

454
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,490
我有想法
I have ideas,

455
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,960
有的想法还挺不错的
some of 'em are even good.

456
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,390
我策划的任务
I planned a mission

457
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,420
然后出了岔子
and then it went sideways.

458
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,470
再然后就乱套了
Then it went upside down.

459
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,760
我现在在盲飞[凭着自己的感觉]
I am flying blind,

460
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,270
不仅斜着还是颠倒的
sideways, and upside down,

461
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,970
你就不能让我消停会儿
so give me a fucking break.

462
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,710
但你不是一个人在战斗
But you're not doin' it alone.

463
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,170
我们突破血门的时候
When we busted through the Blood Gates,

464
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,760
是谁在边上支持你
who was by your side?

465
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,160
他们在阿拉默死地放火烧我们时
When they set us on fire in the Death Fields of Alamore,

466
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:17,740
是谁找到了污水池  我们才得以逃脱的
who found that sewage reservoir for us to jump into?

467
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,730
当眼镜蛇叛变
When Cobra turned

468
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,300
试图趁你睡觉给你下毒时
and tried to poison you in your sleep...

469
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,230
是谁拧下了那叛徒的脑袋
...who pulled that fuckin' traitor's head off?

470
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,640
是猫鼬
Mongoose.

471
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,570
不
No.

472
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,230
是暴狼
Wolf.

473
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,480
我把自己的命交给你
I've given you my life

474
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,450
因为我信任你
because I trust you,

475
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:48,230
你好歹也偶尔听听我的建议
and the least you can do is just listen to me once in a while.

476
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:50,920
好吧
Okay.

477
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,510
下一步怎么办  士兵
What's our next move, soldier?

478
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,060
我们再冲回去
So we blast back in there,

479
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,340
找到克罗尼什在哪间办公室
find which office Kronish is in,

480
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:02,140
到那边屋顶上
post up on that roof,

481
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,120
用狙击声波干掉他
and take him out with a Sniper Sonic.

482
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,660
声波会穿透玻璃
The sound waves will pass right through the glass

483
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,440
直接爆掉他的脑袋
and just pop his fuckin' head off.

484
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,770
干净漂亮
Nice and clean.

485
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:09,780
好了
All right.

486
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,630
三  二  一
Three, two, one.

487
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,480
天啊  别开枪
Oh, God, don't shoot!

488
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,130
-该死的混蛋  -搞什么呢  哥们
- Fuckin' dick. - What the fuck, buddy.

489
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,770
你俩脑子有什么毛病啊
What the fuck got into you people?

490
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:18,820
克罗尼什在哪儿
Where's Kronish?

491
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,590
你十根手指前就该到这儿了
You were supposed to be here ten fingers ago.

492
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,340
他没抓到他  我就知道
He doesn't have him... I knew it.

493
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,360
该死的放弃了任务
Fuckin' aborted the mission.

494
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,650
不  你可说不好
No, you don't know that.

495
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,120
或许他只是找不到他
Maybe he just couldn't find him.

496
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,650
不  暴狼说得对  我...我放弃了
No, yeah, Wolf's right, i... I aborted.

497
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,370
-该死  未来侠  -操你妈的
- Goddammit, Future Man. - God fucking...

498
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,370
不
No!

499
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,610
我站到他的面前
I... I got there in front of him,

500
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:36,300
看着他的眼睛
and I looked into his eyes, and...

501
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,020
我就是下不去手  好吗
I just couldn't do it, okay?

502
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,180
我跟你们不一样  我不是杀人犯
I'm not like you guys, I'm not a murderer.

503
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,650
我们也不是杀人犯
We aren't murderers either.

504
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:42,930
我们是士兵
We're soldiers.

505
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,530
你以为我们喜欢杀人吗
You think we like killing people?

506
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,610
-看着挺喜欢的  -我们不喜欢
- You sure seem to. - Well, we don't.

507
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:49,060
我们杀人是出于无奈  不是出于...爱好
We kill because we have to, not because we... we like it.

508
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,150
那个...
Well...

509
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:52,950
而且这会带来负面影响  知道吗
And it takes a toll, okay?

510
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,750
我睡觉的时候会尖叫
I scream in my sleep.

511
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:57,760
但我们的感觉不重要  因为我们在执行任务
But our feelings don't matter 'cause we're on a mission,

512
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,560
所以除非你能给我一个战略性理由
so unless you can give me one strategic reason

513
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,270
不杀此人
not to kill this man,

514
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,170
我们就别无选择
we have no choice.

515
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,960
好吧  要是...要是我进去
Okay, what if... what if I went in there

516
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,830
找他谈话  得到了理由呢
and talked to him, and I got you one?

517
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,120
一个饶他一命的理由
A reason not to kill him?

518
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,100
你能做到吗
You could do that?

519
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,670
是的  应该可以
Yeah, I... I think so.

520
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,490
你可以进入地下室
Yeah, you could go in there to the basement

521
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,190
找到我们所需要知道的吗
and find out what we need to know?

522
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,850
地下室  他在顶楼
Basement... he's... he's in the top floor.

523
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,060
棒
Yes!

524
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,360
-好  -好的
- All right. - Okay.

525
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,470
-好  -我这就去
- Okay. - I'm on it.

526
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,160
我们在这儿等你  未来侠
All right, we'll be waiting for you, Future Man.

527
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,160
好
Okay.

528
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,280
你演的哪出戏
What the fuck was that?

529
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,470
我经常看你睡觉
I watch you sleep.

530
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,170
你从没尖叫过
You've never screamed once.

531
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,380
我在他身上放了追踪器
I planted a tracker on him.

532
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,000
他会带我们找到克罗尼什
He'll lead us right to Kronish.

533
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:42,840
克罗尼什博士
Dr. Kronish!

534
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,260
你得放弃你所有的研究
You need to abandon all of your research.

535
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,090
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

536
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,970
今天是具有历史意义的一天
This is an historic day.

537
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:52,970
你激励了我去做意见我想做了很多年的事
You inspired me to do something I've been wanting to do for years.

538
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:53,910
你做了什么
What did you do?

539
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,810
你之前让我开始思考
You really got me thinking earlier.

540
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,160
我也许不是刺客的目标
I may not be in the assassin's crosshairs,

541
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,430
但我年纪不小了
but I'm not a young man.

542
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,580
随时可能挂掉
I could go any day.

543
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,810
危机四伏
Danger's all around me.

544
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,240
我不明白
I don't understand.

545
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,140
疱疹的解药不该是我们获利的途径
The cure for herpes shouldn't be ours to profit from.

546
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,350
应该供全世界享用
It should be the world's to heal by.

547
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:11,330
所以我公开了我的研究
So, I've made all my research public,

548
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:14,340
分享给了全球的同事
shared it with a global network of colleagues.

549
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,870
你把解药公诸于世了
You put the cure out to the world?

550
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:20,950
集合全球科学家的智慧
With the combined brainpower of the global scientific community,

551
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,320
疱疹的解药将不会是我的创造
the cure for herpes won't be my creation,

552
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,610
而是我们所有人的
it'll be all of ours.

553
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,830
所以从战略上讲
So strategically speaking,

554
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,040
如果有人想阻止解药面世
uh, if somebody wanted to stop the cure from ever existing,

555
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,360
杀了你也无济于事
murdering you would have zero effect?

556
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,450
疱疹的解药还是会流出
The cure for herpes would still get out there?

557
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,480
这么比喻有点病态  不过是的
A morbid way to put it, but yes.

558
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,140
多亏了你
And thanks to you.

559
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:45,010
解药可以来自于法国  尼日利亚
Oh, well, the cure could come from France, Nigeria,

560
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:47,480
西班牙  中国  任何地方
Spain, China, literally from anywhere.

561
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,100
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

562
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,050
这真是好消息
That's amazing news.

563
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:52,980
你可以活命了
You get to live!

564
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,660
