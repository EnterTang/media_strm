Why did you have to
put so much pressure?

I was wondering what you were doing.

684
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:45,350
We should play the
name tag elimination.

685

It's like I'm back to
when I was a young girl.

- What is it?
- It's interesting.

834
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:16,680
- Kimbap!
- Maybe it's like pinball.

835
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,840
- Are all the men here?
- Yes.

836
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,630
Did you enjoy the lunch
your partner brought?

837
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:24,160
- Yes.
- This time, male students will

838

- What's this?
- I'm good at making kimbap.

840

The thing is, this
is "kimbap of fortune."

841
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,370
We'll give you rice and laver,
but the rest

in front of you.

- You'll put tennis balls.
- That looks fun!

[They're given three chances.]

Saury and chocolate together...
It must be the worst!

[Horrifying ingredients are
side by side the normal ones.]

There're gummy worms, too.

852

If you use fresh garlic
and wasabi together...

853
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,260
But, wasabi as an ingredient
is too much.

854
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,570
[Is that a reward of a punishment?]
I'm not sorry.

855

My partner is quiet old
for that kind of stuff.

I feel uncomfortable.

861

[Na Rae, I might feel
even more uncomfortable.]

862

Do we just throw balls in there?

863
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:26,540
I think the unlucky
people should go first.

864

Then, I'll do it first!

- Yoo Jae Suk.

1453
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:15,520
[This is 100 times scarier
then getting caught as a student.]

1454
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:18,520
[Horrifying]

1455
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:22,520
It's okay.

1456
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:25,290
Miss Hwang, please!

1457
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:28,760
[Powerful discipline]

1458
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:32,070
I can't help it!

1459
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:34,730
[She broke the couple.]

1460
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,640
[Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo are ousted.]

1461
01:11:42,610 --> 01:11:44,750
[Suk Jin and Na Rae have
eloped for an hour.]

1462
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:46,840
Let's go to the jail
and ask what the hint is.

1463
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:49,150
We have no clues at all.

1464
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:53,520
Can you tell us the hint?

1465
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,850
[Yoon Bak and Joy
are about the enter the jail.]

1466
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:57,760
A key?

1467
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:59,560
You don't know the location?

1468
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:00,730
You don't.

1469
01:12:00,730 --> 01:12:04,060
You need to find a secret room.

1470
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:08,270
Just check all the rooms.

1471
01:12:08,830 --> 01:12:13,770
[Ha Ha and Seung Yeon think the same.]
Kwang Soo is over there.

1472
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:15,470
Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo are ousted.

1473
01:12:15,470 --> 01:12:18,080
[They're entering the jail.]

1474
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,850
They're ousted?

1475
01:12:19,850 --> 01:12:21,850
[Will they give them the hint?]
We found a key.

1476
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:25,680
It's the red key.

1477
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:29,150
Kwang Soo, why are you lying?
He's lying.

1478
01:12:29,150 --> 01:12:32,190
Ha Ha, my hint was...

1479
01:12:32,190 --> 01:12:34,760
"Green K."

1480
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:37,100
Green key?

1481
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:39,800
We guessed it's a green key.

1482
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:41,630
Then it means a green key.

1483
01:12:41,630 --> 01:12:43,730
- There should be...
- It's red.

1484
01:12:43,730 --> 01:12:47,540
- You've already ousted!
- Why would you tell him?

1485
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:50,040
I hope everyone fails.

1486
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,510
We can't win the race.

1487
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:54,640
Thank you, Ji Hyo!

1488
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,910
Be careful, Ha Ha!

1489
01:12:56,910 --> 01:13:02,290
- Why would you lie until the end?
- We've searched for it all day.

1490
01:13:02,290 --> 01:13:06,060
We're already ousted.
Let the students win.

1491
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:11,890
[Ha Ha and Seung Yeon
are searching for a green key.]

1492
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:17,300
[They searching from the corner again.]

1493
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:20,100
[It's an empty box.]
Someone took it.

1494
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:25,340
[We will never give up!]
They might have put it on the ceiling.

1495
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:29,680
[They're searching every
nook and cranny.]

1496
01:13:32,410 --> 01:13:33,780
Careful, careful!

1497
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:37,750
- There it is!
- Jackpot!

1498
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:40,320
They hid here?
It's almost impossible to find it.

1499
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:45,800
[It's a key with a green heart!]

1500
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,800
It's green!

1501
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,430
Let's go!

1502
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:57,970
[Don't hesitate!]
Let's just go to the room.

1503
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:02,640
The key is smaller then others.

1504
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,310
Ji Hyo wouldn't have lied to us.

1505
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:05,910
It's not a red key, right?

1506
01:14:05,910 --> 01:14:08,920
It'll never be a red key.
Do you believe what Kwang Soo said?

1507
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:13,990
[It's open!]

1508
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:15,460
Thank you, Ji Hyo!

1509
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:18,320
- It's open!
- Ji Hyo!

1510
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:22,530
[Thanks to Ji Hyo, they get
to see the legendary rings.]

1511
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:26,070
Be careful, don't let
the bracelet rip.

1512
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:28,300
[But, I'm too excited!]

1513
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:30,040
Ji Hyo, we found it!

1514
01:14:33,310 --> 01:14:37,240
Now, we need to get downstairs.

1515
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:39,380
- We need to hide it.
- Cover it.

1516
01:14:45,990 --> 01:14:48,620
Was that a mirror?

1517
01:14:48,620 --> 01:14:52,660
[What did you say?]
We don't have time for that!

1518
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:54,530
I wasn't sure if it was a teacher.

1519
01:14:54,530 --> 01:14:57,030
[She's so different from
the character in the drama.]

1520
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,900
[They get on the elevator quickly.]

1521
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:06,540
Let's go to the P1.

1522
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:10,720
[We've heard that the
platform is on P1.]

1523
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:13,940
[It stopped on the third floor!]

1524
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:16,340
<i>The door is opening.</i>

1525
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:18,020
[Who could it be?]

1526
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:19,490
[Could it be Ha Ha?]

1527
01:15:19,490 --> 01:15:22,010
[Or one of the teachers?]

1528
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:24,110
[Ta-da!]

1529
01:15:24,110 --> 01:15:27,270
[Mr. Jung is here!]

1530
01:15:27,270 --> 01:15:28,730
[He's proud of himself.]

1531
01:15:28,730 --> 01:15:31,100
I've been waiting for you.

1532
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:33,360
Why is it so easy to catch you?

1533
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:35,200
[Use stairs, it's healthier.]

1534
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:36,600
I'm a big fan of you.

1535
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:39,740
I'm your fan, but I'm
your teacher today.

1536
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:42,970
If you keep avoiding...

1537
01:15:42,970 --> 01:15:45,410
that's an infringement
of teachers right.

1538
01:15:45,410 --> 01:15:48,540
Please... let us go.
I'll tell you where others are.

1539
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:50,610
No need.

1540
01:15:50,610 --> 01:15:52,280
I found the celebrity like a treasure.

1541
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:53,780
Please give us
five more seconds.

1542
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:55,750
You're standing too
close to each other!

1543
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:57,920
I don't want to do this physically.

1544
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,190
I know, I know.

1545
01:15:59,190 --> 01:16:00,760
Let's just go out.

1546
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:02,690
It's too cramped here.

1547
01:16:02,690 --> 01:16:04,000
Okay.

1548
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,630
- Do you want to run for a bit?
- Yes, just for a moment.

1549
01:16:07,630 --> 01:16:08,700
I see.

1550
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:11,100
It's a children's game.
Red light, green light.

1551
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:12,500
I'll count to three.

1552
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:15,810
Red light, green light!
[run]

1553
01:16:15,810 --> 01:16:19,140
[Run]
[Stop right there!]

1554
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:21,040
[Run for your life!]

1555
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,580
[Body check!]

1556
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:29,090
[She captures Grasshopper!]

1557
01:16:29,090 --> 01:16:31,990
[While Miss Hwang hold him...]

1558
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:36,630
[Mr. Jung broke the couple up.]

1559
01:16:36,630 --> 01:16:39,330
Are they ousted?

1560
01:16:39,330 --> 01:16:40,630
Good job!

1561
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:43,590
[They were wrecked in three seconds.]

1562
01:16:43,590 --> 01:16:45,560
[Jae Suk and Han Byul are ousted!]

1563
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:55,340
[Ha Ha and Seung Yeon
are running at full speed.]

1564
01:16:55,340 --> 01:16:58,650
[That's the wrong way!]

1565
01:16:59,850 --> 01:17:02,220
We can't get out of this floor.

1566
01:17:05,150 --> 01:17:07,420
We're almost there.

1567
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:13,800
They've met.
They're running!

1568
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,900
Don't we need to go now?

1569
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:18,730
- Let's go!
- They got captured.

1570
01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:22,270
[Mr. Jung is seeing
them to the elevator.]

1571
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:24,770
I almost captured Yoon Bak.
But they locked the door.

1572
01:17:25,570 --> 01:17:27,980
- It's impossible to catch them.
- I've caught them.

1573
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:34,080
[The elevator opens.]

1574
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:38,590
[Kkuk and Stephanie
are inside the elevator.]

1575
01:17:38,590 --> 01:17:42,260
[What a windfall!]
Mr. Jung!

1576
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:43,780
I told you earlier.

1577
01:17:43,780 --> 01:17:46,340
[Kkuk appeared at a perfect moment.]

1578
01:17:46,340 --> 01:17:48,230
- Wait, wait.
- What about them?

1579
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:50,930
We've already caught them.

1580
01:17:50,930 --> 01:17:55,440
[They're keeping an
eye on the situation.]

1581
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:58,470
Are they walking around on P1?

1582
01:17:58,470 --> 01:18:00,840
[Let's go when they're busy!]

1583
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:03,340
[They're still bickering.]
Kim Jong Kook!

1584
01:18:03,340 --> 01:18:05,450
They were on the fourth floor.

1585
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:07,750
[What's going on?]

1586
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:11,280
[They're the students
who are running away.]

1587
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:13,720
[Victory is ours!]

1588
01:18:14,550 --> 01:18:18,060
[I can't let it happen.]

1589
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:24,660
[Where is the platform?]

1590
01:18:26,730 --> 01:18:29,800
It's not here.

1591
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:36,980
[If the platform is not on the P1,
they'll be like a rat in a trap.]

1592
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,120
- Ahhhhh, it's here!
- It's right here!

1593
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:47,050
[Ha Ha and Seung Yeon
stand on the platform.]

1594
01:18:47,050 --> 01:18:48,180
We did it!

1595
01:18:48,180 --> 01:18:53,810
[Ha Ha and Seung Yeon
win the Legendary Couple Ring Race]

1596
01:18:53,810 --> 01:18:57,000
[Deeply moved!]

1597
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,560
[We actually did it!]

1598
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:04,370
[Too bad, I almost caught them.]

1599
01:19:04,370 --> 01:19:08,440
Today's winners are Ha Ha
and Gong Seung Yeon!

1600
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:10,970
[The final winning couple are
Ha Ha and Gong Seung Yeon.]

1601
01:19:10,970 --> 01:19:13,110
Thank you.
[It's good that you won!]

1602
01:19:13,110 --> 01:19:17,020
By the way, Hwang Suk Jung and
Jung Kyung Ho were really scary.

1603
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:21,850
- Yes, they were scary!
- Suk Jung, please show us how you ran.

1604
01:19:22,420 --> 01:19:24,820
Look at her!

1605
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:28,330
[She runs like a ninja.]

1606
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:30,660
She's so scary.
[Lucky, I didn't have to face her.]

1607
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:33,230
Seung Yeon, how was the race?

1608
01:19:33,230 --> 01:19:37,970
I was worried about Running Man.
And it was scary.

1609
01:19:37,970 --> 01:19:39,500
But, I even won the race.

1610
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:43,240
I'm so thankful.
It worked well.

1614
01:19:49,510 --> 01:19:51,650
She kept shaking.

1615
01:19:51,650 --> 01:19:54,520
Give us your thoughts.

1616
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:56,420
I had so much fun.

1617
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:58,620
I want to come back and win next time.

1618
01:19:58,620 --> 01:20:00,560
I'm regretting.

1619
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,430
She's only warmed up now
that it's time to go.

1620
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:03,990
She was absent-minded before.

1621
01:20:03,990 --> 01:20:06,400
Congratulations, again!
