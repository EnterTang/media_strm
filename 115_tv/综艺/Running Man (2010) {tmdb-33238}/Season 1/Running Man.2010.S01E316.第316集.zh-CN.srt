1
00:00:02,311 --> 00:00:04,271
怎么回事？
发生什么事了？
What is it?
What happened?

2
00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:06,607
你爸这下该没完没了了
lt just never stops
with your father.

3
00:00:06,648 --> 00:00:08,108
他怎么了？
What'd he do?

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,068
他被评选为“年度先生”了
He was voted
Man of the Year.

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,238
年度先生？
Man of the Year?

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,199
《时代》杂志发什么神经了？
What has happened
to "Time" magazine?

7
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:20,412
不，是在他的俱乐部里
No, no.
At his lodge.

8
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:23,373
他的俱乐部发什么神经了？
What has happened
to his lodge?

9
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:26,668
噢，他们傻得要命
Oh, they're so stupid.

10
00:00:26,668 --> 00:00:28,629
甚至不允许女士接近
Women aren't even
allowed near the place.

11
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,965
除非他们想要有人给他们筹办一场赞礼
Until they want one of us
to arrange a tribute or something.

12
00:00:32,007 --> 00:00:33,925
－赞礼？
－是的
￡- Tribute?
￡- Yeah.

13
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:36,345
－要我们来做？
－唔～
￡- And we gotta go?
￡- Mm￡-hm.

14
00:00:36,386 --> 00:00:39,723
那天我会生病
l got dibs on l'm sick
that night.

15
00:00:39,765 --> 00:00:42,684
你就说要加班
You do some cop
overtime at work￡-￡-

16
00:00:42,726 --> 00:00:45,270
就说猴子跑到公交车上了什么的
monkey on a bus
somewhere, yeah.

17
00:00:47,773 --> 00:00:50,025
不，我倒是想去
No, no.
l want to go.

18
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:52,361
作为年度先生的儿子
是很光荣的一件事
lt's an honor to be son
of Man of the Year.

19
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:56,406
我甚至连
l don't even want
to be brother of guy

20
00:00:56,448 --> 00:00:59,368
当年度先生的儿子的弟弟都不想
who wants to be son
of Man of the Year.

21
00:00:59,409 --> 00:01:01,828
罗伯特的态度是对的
No, Robert has
the right attitude.

22
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,455
这对你爸爸是件大事
This is a big deal
for your father.

23
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:06,124
但我什么都不想做
And l want nothing
to do with it.

24
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:09,086
你什么意思？我以为
你会操办整件事
What do you mean? Thought you
had to organize the whole thing.

25
00:01:09,086 --> 00:01:12,881
－噢，不！
－噢，是的
￡- Oh, no!
￡- Oh, yes.

26
00:01:12,923 --> 00:01:15,342
你们两个来操办
你爸爸为此很兴奋呢
You two are gonna do this.
Your father's very excited.

27
00:01:15,384 --> 00:01:17,344
他早就开始为此烦我了
He's already bothering
me about it.

28
00:01:17,386 --> 00:01:19,012
爸爸已经知道了？
Dad knows about this?

29
00:01:19,054 --> 00:01:21,473
现在评选年度先生已经不是什么秘密了
They don't surprise
the Man of the Year anymore.

30
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:23,600
所以他们才失去了上一届年度先生
That's how they lost
the last Man of the Year.

31
00:01:25,727 --> 00:01:28,313
来吧，小家伙
我们一起来办
Come on, cubby,
we'll do it together.

32
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:30,607
爸爸一定会很高兴的
我们该做些什么？妈妈
lt will be nice for Dad.
What do we have to do, Mom?

33
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:32,484
－你教教我
－好的
￡- Come on, you tell me.
￡- Okay.

34
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:35,529
那个人做了报告
The guy said something
about a presentation

35
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,365
－还有些事先准备好的演说
－哪个人？
￡- or some prepared remarks.
￡- What guy?

36
00:01:38,407 --> 00:01:41,368
我不清楚
高级白痴～
l don't know.
The Grand High ldiot.

37
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,829
雷蒙德，坐下
你们来办
All right, Raymond,
sit down, you're doing this.

38
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,498
－你们可以作首歌
－是啊
￡- You could do a song.
￡- Yeah.

39
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,667
还记得我很喜欢的那首吗？
You know that one number
l've always loved?

40
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:50,752
“南太平洋”
那些家伙穿着
From "South Pacific"
where the guy wears

41
00:01:50,794 --> 00:01:53,005
草裙和椰子壳胸罩
the grass skirt
and the coconut bra?

42
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,965
是哦～
Yeah!

43
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,220
你平时在家里都干些什么啊！
What do you do
in that apartment?

44
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:15,402
早上好，家人们
Hello, family.

45
00:02:15,444 --> 00:02:19,239
我看你是“年度椅子先生”
l believe you're
in the Chair of the Year.

46
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,783
祝贺你，爸爸！
真了不起！
Congratulations, Dad!
l think it's great!

47
00:02:21,825 --> 00:02:25,370
谢谢，你们要知道
Thank you.
But you know...

48
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:28,332
我只不过是个
想努力超越自己的普通人
l'm just a simple man
who tried to make a difference.

49
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:33,545
我和你们一样
一次也只能穿一条裤子
l still put my pants
on one leg at a time.

50
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:36,798
是吗？我们什么时候才能盼到那个时候？
Yeah, and when can we
look forward to that?

51
00:02:41,052 --> 00:02:43,471
嘿，这池子不错啊
是个放松的好地方
Hey, nice pool.
What a great hang￡-out.

52
00:02:43,513 --> 00:02:46,391
－跟他们谈吧
－打扰一下，先生
￡- Let's talk to this guy over here.
￡- Excuse me, sir.

53
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,393
－能跟你谈谈吗？
－当然
￡- Could we talk to you for a second?
￡- Sure.

54
00:02:51,187 --> 00:02:53,940
呃，我们想问你一些关于弗兰克・巴龙的问题
Uh, we'd like to ask you some questions
about Frank Barone.

55
00:02:53,981 --> 00:02:55,942
开始吧
Shoot.

56
00:02:59,362 --> 00:03:02,281
第一个问题：
Number one:

57
00:03:02,323 --> 00:03:05,326
你为什么不穿衣服？
Why aren't you
wearing a bathing suit?

58
00:03:17,547 --> 00:03:20,508
显然这是俱乐部的规定
lt's obviously
lodge policy.

59
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,176
这是这里的传统
lt's tradition.

60
00:03:22,218 --> 00:03:24,679
－或许我们不该在这里摄像
－不，没关系
￡- Maybe we shouldn't film in here?
￡- No, no, it's fine.

61
00:03:24,721 --> 00:03:27,140
我要开始了
l'll tell you what,
l'm gonna set up right here.

62
00:03:27,181 --> 00:03:30,393
先做一下自我介绍
雷蒙德会采访你，知道了吗？
State your name and Raymond here
is gonna interview you, all right?

63
00:03:30,435 --> 00:03:32,395
不，我不想采访
No, listen.
l don't want to interview.

64
00:03:32,395 --> 00:03:34,647
我来拿摄像机
Let me hold
the camera.

65
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:37,608
快点，雷
你没看见他越来越冷了吗？
Come on, Ray.
Can't you see the guy's getting cold?

66
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,792
好吧
All right.
Here we go.

67
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:57,754
呃，开拍！
Uh, l don't know.

68

好吧，我现在和……

我和……
你刚说你叫什么名字？
l'm here with,
what'd you say your name was?

70
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:09,515
艾伯・沃奇则
但是人们都叫我子弹头
Abe Warchizer.
But everybody calls me Bullethead.

71
00:04:09,557 --> 00:04:11,768
好吧……
All right...

72
00:04:11,809 --> 00:04:13,728
子弹头，呃……
Bullethead, uh...

73
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,230
告诉我们你为什么喜欢弗兰克・巴龙？
just tell us why
you like Frank Barone?

74
00:04:16,272 --> 00:04:18,232
我不喜欢弗兰克・巴龙
l don't like Frank Barone.

75
00:04:23,654 --> 00:04:25,073
OK
Okay.

76
00:04:25,114 --> 00:04:26,866
我现在能到池子里去了吗？
Can l get back
in the pool now?

77
00:04:26,908 --> 00:04:28,826
好吧
Yeah, please.

78
00:04:33,081 --> 00:04:35,041
那一定会伤到他的
That's gotta hurt.

79
00:04:39,962 --> 00:04:42,006
该死，他不喜欢爸爸
Jeez, he doesn't
like Dad.

80
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:45,051
你担心子弹头说的话吗？
打扰了，先生
You're worried about what Bullethead
thinks? Excuse me, sir.

81
00:04:45,093 --> 00:04:47,804
－你认识弗兰克・巴龙吗？
－那又怎样？
￡- You know Frank Barone, right?
￡- What of it?

82
00:04:47,804 --> 00:04:50,807
我们在准备赞礼
你们推举他为年度先生
We're doing a tribute.
You guys elected him Man of the Year.

83
00:04:50,848 --> 00:04:53,142
我们选了他？
We're down to him?

84
00:04:56,312 --> 00:04:58,731
也许这些人并不十分了解爸爸
Maybe these guys
don't know Dad so well.

85
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:01,150
不，也许他们很了解
Yeah, maybe they do.

86
00:05:01,192 --> 00:05:03,528
嘿看啊，那是他的牌友
Hey look!

给爸爸准备赞礼
Well, it's for Dad's

93
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:21,295
好极了，你们一起来，OK？
This is perfect.
You guys can do it together, okay?

94
00:05:21,295 --> 00:05:23,881

00:05:28,177 --> 00:05:30,930
嘿，弗兰克！
你还欠我50块钱！
Hey, Frank!
You owe me 50 bucks!

98
00:05:30,972 --> 00:05:34,017
你答应还我的！
但到现在还没还！
You gave me your word!
l ain't heard from you since!

99
00:05:34,058 --> 00:05:37,145
你躲了我1年半了！听到了吗？
You've been ducking me
for a year and a half! You hear me?!

100
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:39,105
50块钱还是小事！
50 bucks is nothing!

101
00:05:39,147 --> 00:05:41,649
你还把我的车撞了一个坑！
How about the dent

102
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:43,109
还说那不是你干的！
You told me
it wasn't you!

103
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:46,946
但我有目击证人！
我还有帐单！
l have eyewitnesses!
And l have a bill!

104
00:05:46,988 --> 00:05:50,366
要是我现在有口袋就好了
我一定会随身带着的！
l wish l had pockets
'cause l'd carry it with me!

105
00:05:50,408 --> 00:05:52,493
等着瞧！
Wait right here!

106
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:54,454
你这个骗子！
You're a liar!

骗子！听到了吗？

向你妈妈问好！
Hey, say hi

113
00:06:12,513 --> 00:06:14,432
我们怎么办？
What are we
going to do?

114
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,392
不知道
l don't know.

115
00:06:16,434 --> 00:06:19,645
也许我们可以把一些片段剪辑一下
Maybe we can piece something
together in editing, you know?

116
00:06:19,687 --> 00:06:21,814
打扰一下，先生们
现在正式开拍

－弗兰克・巴龙
￡- Who doesn't like￡-￡-
￡- Frank Barone.

129
00:07:03,272 --> 00:07:05,191
唔～唔～
Mmm￡-mm￡-mm.

130
00:07:07,985 --> 00:07:10,488
－爸爸，怎么了？
－这算什么颁奖礼？
￡- Come on, Dad. What are you doing?
￡- That was a tribute?

131
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,616
－怎么？你不喜欢？
－傻死了
￡- What, you didn't like it?
￡- lt was stupid!

132
00:07:13,658 --> 00:07:15,159
而且太短了
And it was so short!

133
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,370
我们用的是那种……
Yeah, well, we kinda
went with a fast

134
00:07:17,412 --> 00:07:19,580
快速MTV的剪辑手法
MTv kind of editing.

135
00:07:19,622 --> 00:07:21,624
我不喜欢
Well l didn't get it!

136
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:25,086
还有科莱利说他喜欢我裹着糖粉热呼呼的
是什么意思？
And what's with Correlli saying
he likes me hot with marshmallows?

137
00:07:32,802 --> 00:07:35,122
－我叫你把那一段剪掉的！
－但我觉得很可爱！
￡- l told you to get rid of that!
￡- lt was cute!

138
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,841
弗兰克，你在干什么啊？
Frank, what are you doing?

139
00:07:36,883 --> 00:07:38,343
走吧，我们回家
Come on, we're going home.

140
00:07:38,343 --> 00:07:40,678
你说什么呢？今天是你的大日子
What are you talking about?
This is your big night!

141
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,515
已经不是什么大日子了，走吧
lt's not so big anymore.
Let's go.

142
00:07:43,556 --> 00:07:45,308
你连牛排都没吃完
You didn't even finish
your steak.

143
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,519
我不饿！
l'm not hungry!

144
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,780
我们真应该打扮成小妞的！
Should've dressed
like broads!

145
00:08:13,404 --> 00:08:15,114
别这个样子！
Would you stop?

146
00:08:15,156 --> 00:08:17,075
孩子们没做错什么
The boys did nothing wrong.

147
00:08:17,116 --> 00:08:19,994
你不是想要他们给你准备一个赞礼吗？
他们准备了！
You wanted them to make you
a tribute, they made you a tribute.

148
00:08:20,036 --> 00:08:22,372
我等不及要听我的颂词了！
l can't wait
for my eulogy!

149
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,630
你真不该就那样离开
那是孩子们特意为你准备的夜晚
You still don't walk out on an evening
your sons planned for you.

150
00:08:30,672 --> 00:08:34,759
汤姆・崔凡雅克的赞礼有37分钟！
Tom Trevonyak got a tribute
that lasted 37 minutes!

151
00:08:34,801 --> 00:08:37,554
他们把他的整个人生都拍了进去
The guys made a whole
video on his life

152
00:08:37,595 --> 00:08:41,307
盛大的演说，温馨的笑声
表达他们有多爱他
with big speeches and laughs
and how much they love him.

153
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:43,268
他们还录了一段精彩的舞蹈
And they did a big,
wonderful music thing

154
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:45,270
每个人都打扮得像个小妞
where they all
dressed up like broads.

155
00:08:47,647 --> 00:08:50,483
罗比本来也打算那么穿的
Well Robbie was ready
to dress up.

156
00:08:50,483 --> 00:08:53,069
糟透了！他们做得糟透了！
That stunk, what they did!
All right?

157
00:08:53,111 --> 00:08:55,029
我知道赞礼应该是怎样的！
l know a tribute!

158
00:08:55,071 --> 00:08:57,156
这个家不再欢迎他们了
They're not welcomed
in this house anymore!

159
00:08:57,198 --> 00:08:59,868
－真的吗？
－没错
￡- Oh, really?
￡- That's correct!

160
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:02,495
－这么说他们让你失望了？
－是的
￡- So they let you down?
￡- Yes!

161
00:09:02,537 --> 00:09:05,999
－那你那些俱乐部的朋友呢？
－他们怎么了？
￡- What about your buddies at the lodge?
￡- What about them!

162
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,293
你怎么不想想
如果他们说了你很多好话
Don't you think if they
had said something great

163
00:09:08,334 --> 00:09:10,336
雷蒙德和罗比怎么可能不拍下来？
that Raymond and Robbie
would have put it in?

164
00:09:10,378 --> 00:09:13,506
这才是真正让你烦恼的吧？
lsn't that what's
really bothering you?

165
00:09:28,396 --> 00:09:30,523
“用泡菜做成脚趾”
& l've got pickles
for toes &

166
00:09:30,565 --> 00:09:32,483
“芥菜做成鼻子……”
& And a rutabaga nose... &

167
00:09:33,443 --> 00:09:35,361
弗兰克，你在干嘛？
Frank, what are you doing?

168
00:09:35,403 --> 00:09:37,155
看电视
l'm watching.

169
00:09:37,155 --> 00:09:40,491
“樟树叶子做头发，再把甜瓜放在……：
& Sassafras hair
and a melon under there... &

170
00:09:40,533 --> 00:09:42,911
把它关掉
Come on.
Shut that off, please.

171
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,455
安静，我听不见了
Quiet!
l can't hear.

172
00:09:46,497 --> 00:09:48,458
你关不关，弗兰克？
Would you shut it, Frank?

173
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:51,502
“我是个蔬菜人，你可以把我吃掉。
尝尝我的手……”
& l'm the veggie wedge man
and you can eat me, try my hand. &

174
00:09:55,423 --> 00:09:57,383
蠢玩意～
Stupid crap!

175
00:10:03,932 --> 00:10:05,850
知道吗？我打算退出那个俱乐部
You know what?
l'm quitting that lodge.

176
00:10:05,892 --> 00:10:07,810
－太好了
－你说太好了是什么意思？
￡- Good.
￡- What do you mean, good?

177
00:10:07,852 --> 00:10:09,812
那是个白痴俱乐部
lt's a stupid lodge.

178
00:10:11,105 --> 00:10:13,066
里面都是些脑筋秀逗的老头
lt's full of crotchety
old men who think

179
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:16,194
认为人生最大的享受就是
赤身裸体地流汗和咳嗽
the greatest luxury in life
is sweating naked and coughing.

180
00:10:22,909 --> 00:10:25,453
而你总是一味地抱怨他们
And all you ever do
is complain about them.

181
00:10:25,495 --> 00:10:27,455
你以前怎么不说？
Well why didn't you
say something before?

182
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,415
因为那会让你滚远些
lt gets you
out of the house.

183
00:10:35,004 --> 00:10:36,965
走吧，睡觉去
Come on.
Let's go to bed.

184
00:10:39,092 --> 00:10:41,261
－嘿
－什么？
￡- Hey.
￡- What?

185
00:10:43,972 --> 00:10:47,559
你……你会说什么？
What￡-￡- what would
you say?

186
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,394
什么？
What?

187
00:10:51,855 --> 00:10:54,607
你会在赞礼里说什么？
What would you say
in a tribute?

188
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:56,484
什么意思？
What do you mean?

189
00:10:58,069 --> 00:11:01,573
你会在我的赞礼里说什么？
What would you say
in a tribute to me?

190
00:11:01,614 --> 00:11:04,325
我不知道，弗兰克
Well, l don't know,
Frank.

191
00:11:04,367 --> 00:11:06,077
他们没问过我
They didn't ask me.

192
00:11:07,036 --> 00:11:08,997
OK
Okay.

193
00:11:16,546 --> 00:11:18,798
我会说……
l would say...

194
00:11:18,798 --> 00:11:21,718
他是我结婚42年的丈夫
he's been my husband
for 42 years.

195
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:24,679
我们有两个棒儿子
That we have two
wonderful boys together

196
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:27,265
还有三个漂亮的孙子
and three beautiful
grandchildren.

197
00:11:27,307 --> 00:11:29,893
不是吗？
lsn't that right?

198
00:11:29,934 --> 00:11:31,895
就这样？
That's it?

199
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:38,109
还没说完呢
Let me finish.

200
00:11:40,403 --> 00:11:42,322
他一直陪伴在我们身边
And that he's always
been there for us

201
00:11:42,363 --> 00:11:44,282
支持着我们
and been a good
provider.

202
00:11:44,324 --> 00:11:47,243
尽管我们时不时地争吵
And that even though
we squabble every now and then,

203
00:11:47,285 --> 00:11:49,245
我知道
l know that...

204
00:11:49,287 --> 00:11:51,789
他就是我要的那个人
he's the one for me.

205
00:11:51,831 --> 00:11:54,626
尽管有很多不爽，但我会忍着的
And whatever l did
to deserve him, l'll live with.

206
00:11:57,086 --> 00:12:00,340
说得好！我喜欢这种幽默
l like that!
With the humor, yeah.

207
00:12:04,427 --> 00:12:07,514
现在，我能问你几个问题吗？
Now, can l ask
you something?

208
00:12:09,849 --> 00:12:13,019
－走吧，我们该睡觉了
－不，不。别这样，弗兰克
￡- Come on, let's go to bed.
￡- No, no, come on, Frank!

209
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:14,604
我们在聊天！
We were talking!

210
00:12:14,646 --> 00:12:16,940
－我累了，我要去睡觉
－噢，当然了
￡- l'm tired. l'm going to bed.
￡- Oh, sure!

211
00:12:16,981 --> 00:12:19,943
你从我这儿得到了你想要的
现在要去睡觉了
Now you got what you needed
from me and now you're going to sleep.

212
00:12:19,984 --> 00:12:21,986
已经不是新鲜事了
What else is new?

213
00:12:27,825 --> 00:12:29,869
你到底想干嘛？
What do you want?

214
00:12:29,911 --> 00:12:33,998
我想和你沟通，弗兰克
l want to have
a conversation, Frank.

215
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,292
我想和你说说话
l want to talk to you.

216
00:12:36,334 --> 00:12:38,419
这个要求过分吗？
ls that asking so much?

217
00:12:38,461 --> 00:12:41,756
我就知道会这样
l know where this is going.

218
00:12:41,798 --> 00:12:43,299
到这里来
Here, here.

219
00:12:43,341 --> 00:12:45,301
坐下
Sit down here,
please.

220
00:12:46,469 --> 00:12:48,721
一个男人究竟能承受多少“沟通”？
How much talking
can a guy take?

221
00:12:48,763 --> 00:12:50,390
谢谢
Thank you.

222
00:12:50,431 --> 00:12:52,392
现在……
Now...

223
00:12:54,811 --> 00:12:57,981
要是你，会怎么赞颂我呢？
What would your tribute
for me be?

224
00:13:02,485 --> 00:13:04,404
－嗯？
－这太傻了吧？
￡- Well?
￡- This is stupid.

225
00:13:04,445 --> 00:13:07,198
你刚才问我的时候怎么不觉得傻？
lt wasn't stupid
when you just asked me!

226
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,410
我现在意识到傻了
Yes it was!
l know realize how stupid it was!

227
00:13:10,451 --> 00:13:14,372
我刚才给了你一个中听的、慷慨的回答
是不是？
Well l gave you a very lovely
and generous answer, didn't l?

228
00:13:14,414 --> 00:13:16,124
不是吗？
Well didn't l?

229
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,168
好吧
All right!

230
00:13:29,804 --> 00:13:32,223
你在等什么啊？
What are you
getting ready for?

231
00:13:32,265 --> 00:13:34,726
我又不是给你洗礼
l'm not anointing
you here.

232
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:38,146
你可是难得对我说几句好话的
Well, it isn't every day you say
nice things about me.

233
00:13:38,188 --> 00:13:40,315
那是因为你难得强迫我说
Well it's not every day
that you force me!

234
00:13:40,356 --> 00:13:42,192
噢，别这样！弗兰克
Oh, stop it, Frank!

235
00:13:42,233 --> 00:13:44,652
快点啊，你会说什么？
Come on!
What were you going to say?

236
00:13:44,694 --> 00:13:47,906
－ 你说话唾沫星子乱溅！
－ 噢，够了！
￡- Sometimes you spit when you talk.
￡- Oh, that's it!!

237
00:13:47,947 --> 00:13:50,366
－够了！
－嘿，我说什么了？
￡- That's it!
￡- Hey, what did l say! Come on!

238
00:13:50,408 --> 00:13:52,827
你是我最需要的人
You're the one for me!

239
00:13:52,869 --> 00:13:55,163
你想知道为什么人们不喜欢你吗？
弗兰克
You want to know why people
don't love you, Frank?

240
00:13:55,205 --> 00:13:58,291
你想知道吗？
因为你什么都不肯付出
You want to know?
You offer them nothing. That's right.

241
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,627
你得付出爱，弗兰克，才能得到爱
You have to give love,
Frank, to get it.

242
00:14:00,668 --> 00:14:03,588
但你从不愿付出
And you have never
ever been willing to do that!

243
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,590
你只是一味地索取、索取
You just take
and take and take

244
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:08,510
还期望每个人都忍受你的可恶
and expect everybody
to accept your obnoxious

245
00:14:08,551 --> 00:14:10,470
就像茅坑里的石头！
horse's ass
of a personality!

246
00:14:10,512 --> 00:14:14,182
每个人都得容忍你
And everybody has to put up
with it because it's you!

247
00:14:16,267 --> 00:14:18,186
你知道最悲哀的是什么吗？
You know what the sad
part is?

248
00:14:18,228 --> 00:14:21,147
你的身边是一群爱你的家人
You are surrounded by family
who happen to love you anyway.

249
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:23,191
而你却把他们推得远远的
And you push them away.

250
00:14:23,233 --> 00:14:25,193
你把我们都推得远远的
You push us all away.

251
00:14:27,195 --> 00:14:29,155
但从今以后，不再需要了
You don't have
to push anymore.

252
00:14:44,045 --> 00:14:46,256
你真不打算和我谈了？
You're not gonna talk
to me about this?

253
00:14:47,257 --> 00:14:48,925
弗兰克？！
Frank?!

254
00:14:51,886 --> 00:14:53,805
婚姻不应该是这样的
弗兰克
This is not a marriage,
Frank!

255
00:14:53,847 --> 00:14:57,725
婚姻应该是两个人分担、交流！
A marriage is two people
sharing things, talking!

256
00:14:57,767 --> 00:15:00,353
假如出现了问题，应该好好沟通！
And if they have a problem,
they talk about it!

257
00:15:00,395 --> 00:15:03,273
你不能坐在那里，面无表情地看着
你的妻子离去
You don't just sit there
and wait for the other one to go away!

258
00:15:19,372 --> 00:15:21,791
你能在任何地方找到的东西……
Anything you'll find
anywhere else.

259
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,210
刚才谁说三明治？
Did someone say
sandwiches?

260
00:15:24,252 --> 00:15:26,212
我！
Yes!

261
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:33,344
噢！
Oh.

262
00:16:14,802 --> 00:16:16,763
我们得谈谈！
We're gonna talk
about this.

263
00:16:24,604 --> 00:16:26,564
噢，他妈的～！
Oh crap!

264
00:16:32,445 --> 00:16:34,906
－ 我的妈呀！
－ 别这样，弗兰克
￡- Jeez!
￡- Oh, stop it, Frank!

265
00:16:34,989 --> 00:16:38,117
某人想睡觉，却被艺妓袭击了
A guy wants to go to bed,
he gets attacked by a kabuki.

266
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:40,119
够了！
Oh, stop it!

267
00:16:40,119 --> 00:16:42,372
好吧
All right.

268
00:16:42,413 --> 00:16:44,624
现在说吧
Now you talk
to me.

269
00:16:46,334 --> 00:16:48,419
好吧，听着
我……
All right.

我知道，呃……
know the boys did their best.
l know, uh...

271
00:16:50,964 --> 00:16:54,008
人们不喜欢我，是我自己的过错
it's my own stupid fault
people aren't crazy about me

272
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,010
我对大家很抱歉
and l'm sorry
to everybody.

273
00:16:58,763 --> 00:17:01,057
你那么说是为了敷衍我吧？
You're just saying that
so l'll leave you alone.

274
00:17:07,105 --> 00:17:10,191
你就不能对我说几句中听的话么？
You still can't think of anything
nice to say about me?

275
00:17:16,114 --> 00:17:18,658
我枕着它睡觉怎么样？
How about l
sleep on it?

276
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:22,787
真是可笑！
lt's all jokes.

277
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:11,169
弗兰克，你在干什么？
别，我有用的
Frank, what are you doing?
No, no, l need that.

278
00:18:11,211 --> 00:18:12,462
弗兰克！
Frank!

279
00:18:12,503 --> 00:18:14,464
弗兰……
Fr￡-￡-

280
00:18:29,854 --> 00:18:33,316
我比较喜欢你脸上没有这些破玩意儿
l like you better
without the crap on your face.

281
00:18:38,196 --> 00:18:40,156
OK？
Okay?

282
00:18:42,283 --> 00:18:45,203
你应该试着每天都对我说一些像这样的话
You should try and say something
like that to me every day.

283
00:18:48,498 --> 00:18:50,458
我会试的

我是年度先生

Man of the Year.

287
00:19:00,218 --> 00:19:02,804
没错，你就是的
Yes, you are.

288
00:19:05,515 --> 00:19:08,268
我现在要努力摆脱“年度一次先生”
And l'm looking to move
up from Man Once a Year.

289
00:19:11,896 --> 00:19:14,649
瞧？幽默吧？
See?
With the humor.

290
00:19:17,896 --> 00:19:20,315
想不想去睡了？

你什么都没做错
