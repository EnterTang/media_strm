1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,516
好吧，那么……
Okay, so...

2
00:00:03,558 --> 00:00:05,894
看这里，唐格伍德附近的老克隆尼亚大酒店
now here's an old Colonial
inn near Tanglewood.

3
00:00:05,894 --> 00:00:08,313
－唐格伍德是什么东西？
－那里可以欣赏到古典音乐
￡- What's Tanglewood?
￡- They have classical music.

4
00:00:08,313 --> 00:00:09,731
这是音乐会的时间表
Here's the concert
schedule.

5
00:00:09,772 --> 00:00:12,108
这是我脸上的表情
And here's my face.

6
00:00:14,819 --> 00:00:18,615
或者我们也可以住在广场酒店
Or we can stay
at The Plaza,

7
00:00:18,615 --> 00:00:20,575
在太阳饭店吃饭，再看场演出
eat at Le Cirque
and see a show.

8
00:00:20,617 --> 00:00:23,328
不去，我爸妈总是取笑那些住广场酒店的人
No, my parents make fun of people
who stay at The Plaza.

9
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:26,289
－我的父母就住广场酒店
－唔……
￡- My parents stay at The Plaza.
￡- Eh...

10
00:00:26,372 --> 00:00:28,249
好吧
Okay, all right.

11
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,877
那么，你父母觉得艾德朗戴克山怎么样？
Then how do your parents feel
about the Adirondacks?

12
00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:33,504
去那儿有什么可干的？
What do you do there?

13
00:00:33,546 --> 00:00:36,633
租一间很不错的别墅
看看这个
You rent a nice house.
Look at this.

14
00:00:36,674 --> 00:00:38,176
紧邻湖畔
Right on the lake.

15
00:00:38,218 --> 00:00:40,303
我们要呆在别人的房子里？
We'd be staying
in someone else's house?

16
00:00:40,345 --> 00:00:42,555
他们不会在那儿的
They won't be there.

17
00:00:42,597 --> 00:00:45,058
我不想睡在别人睡过的床上
l don't sleep where
other people have slept.

18
00:00:45,099 --> 00:00:48,394
那你以为旅馆是什么？
What do you think
hotels are?

19
00:00:48,436 --> 00:00:50,396
你在嚷嚷？
你干嘛要嚷嚷？
You're yelling.
Why are you yelling?

20
00:00:50,438 --> 00:00:52,357
因为你什么地方都不想去
Because you don't wanna
go anywhere.

21
00:00:52,398 --> 00:00:54,108
我想去的，相信我
l do, believe me.

22
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,946
只不过你刚才说的那些
都不是很有趣
lt's just that nothing
you've mentioned sounds fun yet.

23
00:00:57,987 --> 00:01:00,365
好吧，那你来选
Okay, then you pick.

24
00:01:00,406 --> 00:01:02,367
只要你觉得好，我们就去
And whatever sounds
fun to you we'll do.

25
00:01:02,408 --> 00:01:04,285
－你想让我来选？
－是的，雷！
￡- You want me to pick?
￡- Yes, Ray!

26
00:01:04,327 --> 00:01:07,705
因为我们去哪儿并不重要
只要我们能够在一起
Because it doesn't matter where we go
as long as we can be together!

27
00:01:09,415 --> 00:01:13,169
－好了，冷静点
－好吧
￡- All right, let's calm it down.
￡- All right.

28
00:01:13,211 --> 00:01:15,964
我只不过太想去了
lt's just that l really
want to do this.

29
00:01:16,005 --> 00:01:18,424
－我也是
－好吧
￡- Me too.
￡- Okay!

30
00:01:20,593 --> 00:01:23,805
参观本和杰瑞的冰激凌工厂
A tour of Ben & Jerry's
ice cream factory.

31
00:01:23,846 --> 00:01:26,599
这也能算是旅行？
Can that be a trip?

32
00:01:28,142 --> 00:01:29,978
是的，能算
Yes, it can.

33
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:31,604
因为这家工厂在佛蒙特
Because the factory's
in vermont.

34
00:01:31,646 --> 00:01:33,606
看，野花盛开遍野
See, the wild flowers
are blooming.

35
00:01:33,648 --> 00:01:36,067
我们还可以住在这座可爱的家庭旅馆里
And we can stay
at this cute bed and breakfast.

36
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:38,903
我们为什么不干脆住在
本和杰瑞的房子里？
Why don't we just stay
at Ben & Jerry's house?

37
00:01:38,903 --> 00:01:41,447
我马上打电话去佛蒙特
l'm calling vermont.

38
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:44,242
免费样品
Free samples.

39
00:01:45,368 --> 00:01:47,662
我打赌肯定是个陷阱
l'll bet
there's a catch.

40
00:01:55,556 --> 00:01:57,266
嘿，很好看
Hey, that's cute.

41
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,984
天啊
God.

42
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:07,777
艾米，我明天就要去佛蒙特了
Amy, l'm going to vermont
tomorrow.

43
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:10,071
却没有什么好衣服可以穿
l have nothing to take
on this trip.

44
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:12,407
但你有一个老公
You have a husband.

45
00:02:12,448 --> 00:02:14,701
那代表了很多东西
Lots of things
go with that.

46
00:02:14,742 --> 00:02:16,995
现在我愿意用他来换一条
Right now l'd trade him
for a pair of pants

47
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:19,414
让我的屁股看起来小一点的裤子
that make my butt
look smaller.

48
00:02:19,455 --> 00:02:21,874
你知道什么才能使你的屁股看起来小一点吗？
You know what makes
your butt look smaller?

49
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:24,794
一个老公
A husband.

50
00:02:24,836 --> 00:02:28,715
那么，罗伯特还没有和别人约会？
So, Robert hasn't started
dating anyone else yet?

51
00:02:28,756 --> 00:02:32,135
你是指从我们刚才在女鞋柜台谈论他以后？
You mean since we talked
about him in the shoe department?

52
00:02:32,176 --> 00:02:34,679
我知道，我知道
l know, l know.

53
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:36,556
试试这件
Here, try this on.

54
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:41,561
－哈！
－不，别这样
￡- Ugh!
￡- No, come on.

55
00:02:41,602 --> 00:02:43,688
配你刚买的那条围巾很好看
lt'll look great
with that scarf you bought.

56
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,441
要不要再买几双新运动鞋？
And maybe those new
platform sneakers.

57
00:02:46,482 --> 00:02:49,444
我不再有意思了
l'm not fun anymore.

58
00:02:49,485 --> 00:02:51,571
你在说什么啊？
What are you
talking about?

59
00:02:51,612 --> 00:02:53,656
你很有意思，我们在一起很开心
You're fun.
We're having fun.

60
00:02:53,698 --> 00:02:55,908
我们午餐还喝了红酒呢
We have wine at lunch.

61
00:02:56,909 --> 00:02:58,369
好吧
Okay.

62
00:03:08,046 --> 00:03:10,465
试试别的颜色？
Another color maybe?

63
00:03:11,632 --> 00:03:14,635
怎么了？怎么回事？
What? What is it?

64
00:03:14,677 --> 00:03:17,805
我是个无趣的家庭主妇
l'm a boring housewife!

65
00:03:17,847 --> 00:03:20,350
－什么？
－我是个又老又胖的无趣的家庭主妇
￡- What?
￡- l'm a big old boring housewife!

66
00:03:20,391 --> 00:03:23,061
所以雷才不想去佛蒙特
And that's why Ray isn't excited
about going to vermont.

67
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:25,063
我应该取消整个旅行
l should just cancel
the whole trip.

68
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:28,650
别这样，你一点也不无趣
Come on,
you're not boring.

69
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:31,611
你们会过得很开心的
You're going to have
an amazing, amazing time!

70
00:03:31,653 --> 00:03:33,571
和你的老公在一起哦
With your husband!

71
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:35,990
看！
Look.

72
00:03:36,032 --> 00:03:38,076
当娜・卡冉
Donna Karan.

73
00:03:47,418 --> 00:03:49,128
我到底在想什么？
What was l thinking?

74
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,715
雷愿意去佛蒙特，完全是为了冰激凌
Ray's only going to vermont
for the ice cream.

75
00:03:52,757 --> 00:03:56,135
那个节目只需要2个小时
余下的时间就剩我了
That tour lasts two hours
then it's just me.

76
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,933
价格贵得太离谱了！
These prices
are outrageous.

77
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:07,893
这都是怎么回事？
What's all this?

78
00:04:07,934 --> 00:04:11,521
当你们出门的时候，我来照顾孩子
不记得了？
l'm babysitting for you while you're
on your getaway, remember?

79
00:04:11,563 --> 00:04:14,107
噢，但是我们不到明天不会走的
Oh, okay, but we
don't leave until tomorrow,

80
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:16,818
所以我们明天才走
so leave until tomorrow.

81
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,361
嘿
Hey.

82
00:04:18,403 --> 00:04:20,697
－这是我向你借的包
－好的
￡- Here's the bag that l borrowed.
￡- Yeah.

83
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:23,450
这是什么味道？
你用来装什么了？
What's this smell?
What did you keep in it?

84
00:04:23,491 --> 00:04:25,452
一些肉
Some meat.

85
00:04:28,805 --> 00:04:31,225
我看到妈妈在搬东西
So l see Ma's
laying in supplies.

86
00:04:31,266 --> 00:04:34,394
欢迎你明天来这里吃晚饭
You're welcome to come over
here for dinner tomorrow night.

87
00:04:34,436 --> 00:04:36,313
噢，我懂了
你们欢迎我偶尔过来串串门
Oh, l see.
So l'm a nice guy to have over,

88
00:04:36,355 --> 00:04:38,106
但是不想我住在这里
but you wouldn't want me
staying here.

89
00:04:38,148 --> 00:04:40,567
－怎么了？罗伯特
－没什么
￡- What, Robert?
￡- Nothing.

90
00:04:40,609 --> 00:04:43,654
我不问，也不想
Wasn't asked,
wasn't considered.

91
00:04:43,695 --> 00:04:45,823
你在想什么？亲爱的
What were you
considered for, dear?

92
00:04:45,864 --> 00:04:48,033
看看，今天的节目是……
Let's see,
today's category...

93
00:04:48,075 --> 00:04:50,452
照顾孩子
child care.

94
00:04:50,494 --> 00:04:53,956
－听着，罗伯特，我不是想……
－噢，你不是想！
￡- Look, Robert. l didn't think￡-￡-
￡- Oh, you didn't think!

95
00:04:53,997 --> 00:04:56,250
难道你不觉得一个在CPR受训，
Why would you think someone
who's trained in CPR,

96
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,502
受过公共安全和急救专业训练的人，
public safety
and conflict resolution

97
00:04:58,544 --> 00:05:01,129
是完全有能力当个保姆的吗？
would be able
to babysit?

98
00:05:02,923 --> 00:05:05,676
罗伯特，你想来照顾孩子？很好
Robert, you want to take
care of the kids? Fine.

99
00:05:05,717 --> 00:05:09,596
－不需要妈妈来做这些
－她必须得做这些
￡- Mom doesn't have to do it.
￡- Yes she does have to do it.

100
00:05:09,638 --> 00:05:12,432
那样我才能远离她
That's my getaway from her.

101
00:05:12,474 --> 00:05:14,893
我可以过来这里帮忙
l can come
over here and help.

102
00:05:14,935 --> 00:05:17,646
但那和你住在这里，而我呆在那里
That's not the same thing
as you staying here

103
00:05:17,688 --> 00:05:20,107
完全不是一回事
and me staying there.

104
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:22,943
妈，我不需要你帮忙，OK？
Ma, l don't need
your help, okay?

105
00:05:22,985 --> 00:05:25,696
－我可以照顾孩子
－好的，亲爱的，没问题
￡- l can take care of the kids.
￡- Okay, dear, okay.

106
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,448
什么？
What?

107
00:05:30,409 --> 00:05:32,369
噢，好的
Oh, okay.

108
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:34,746
好的
Good!

109
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:40,711
怎么了？
What?

110
00:05:40,752 --> 00:05:43,172
再见！
Goodbye!

111
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:45,883
那我也走了
l'll be going
along, too.

112
00:05:45,883 --> 00:05:48,135
三天后再见
l'll see you
in three days.

113
00:05:48,177 --> 00:05:50,637
－好的
－怎么回事？
￡- Yeah. Okay.
￡- What?

114
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:52,347
没什么，亲爱的
Nothing, dear.

115
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:54,016
拜拜
Bye￡-bye.

116
00:05:55,392 --> 00:05:57,561
嘿，听着
我不想让你不高兴
Hey, look.
l won't let you down.

117
00:05:57,603 --> 00:05:59,730
好好放松，享受旅行吧
Just relax and go enjoy
your trip.

118
00:05:59,771 --> 00:06:01,690
是啊，我知道
Yeah, yeah.
l know.

119
00:06:01,732 --> 00:06:04,485
你以前去过这些家庭旅馆吗？
You ever been to one
of these bed and breakfasts?

120
00:06:04,526 --> 00:06:06,528
是的，和我的前妻
Yeah, with my ex￡-wife.

121
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,405
感觉怎么样？
How was it?

122
00:06:08,447 --> 00:06:11,950
你没听到那句话的末尾吗？
Did you not catch
the end of that sentence?

123
00:06:11,992 --> 00:06:14,620
好吧，很好
Yeah, great.

124
00:06:15,871 --> 00:06:17,789
你那是什么表情啊？
What's with the face?

125
00:06:17,831 --> 00:06:20,042
我不知道，只是……
l don't know.
Yeah, it's just...

126
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,377
要出去这么长的时间
going away together
is so much time

127
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:24,046
呆在一起
together.

128
00:06:24,087 --> 00:06:26,673
你怕什么？
What are you afraid of?

129
00:06:26,715 --> 00:06:29,426
－你们还……
－什么？
￡- You guys still￡-￡-
￡- What?

130
00:06:44,066 --> 00:06:46,944
是啊是啊，我们有做
不过不是这个问题
Yeah, yeah, we do.
But that's not the problem.

131
00:06:46,985 --> 00:06:48,570
是内在关系
lt's the in￡-between.

132
00:06:48,612 --> 00:06:51,907
啊，你是说剩余的时间
Ah, the remains of the day.

133
00:06:54,993 --> 00:06:57,454
她一直在说会有多么浪漫
She keeps saying how romantic
it's going to be.

134
00:06:57,496 --> 00:06:59,873
整整三天的浪漫
Three days of romantic.

135
00:06:59,915 --> 00:07:02,209
我都看不见市场需求
l don't see the need.

136
00:07:04,002 --> 00:07:06,713
听着，我给你一点建议
Listen, let me give you
some advice.

137
00:07:06,755 --> 00:07:09,007
这些旅行是为妻子准备的
These trips
are for the wife.

138
00:07:09,049 --> 00:07:11,093
就像是度周末
lt's a weekend.

139
00:07:11,134 --> 00:07:14,096
雷蒙德，雷蒙德
Raymond, Raymond,
Raymond, Raymond.

140
00:07:14,137 --> 00:07:16,056
知道吗？有的时候，在监狱里
You know, sometimes
at the precinct

141
00:07:16,098 --> 00:07:19,476
我们把一些罪犯关进一个房间过周末
we've got the throw guys
into the lock￡-up for a weekend.

142
00:07:19,518 --> 00:07:22,229
你猜哪些人会最难熬？
And you know which guys
have the worst time there?

143
00:07:22,271 --> 00:07:24,231
个子小的？
The small ones?

144
00:07:28,777 --> 00:07:30,696
不是
No.

145
00:07:30,737 --> 00:07:32,823
一直看表的人
The guys who are watching
the clock.

146
00:07:32,865 --> 00:07:35,909
但是那些扳手腕，
But the guys
who arm￡-wrestle,

147
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:37,411
玩牌，吹口哨的人
play cards, whistle,

148
00:07:37,452 --> 00:07:41,206
却觉得时间过得很快
those are the ones
for who time passes quickly.

149
00:07:41,248 --> 00:07:44,042
是啊，但是我得说话
Yeah, but l have to talk.

150
00:07:44,084 --> 00:07:46,420
而那些家伙却有权保持沉默
Those guys have the right
to remain silent.

151
00:07:48,422 --> 00:07:50,382
－嗨
－嗨，宝贝
￡- Hi.
￡- Hey, honey.

￡- What did you get?

156
00:07:58,891 --> 00:08:01,727

Well, l got a great outfit

157
00:08:01,768 --> 00:08:03,687

159
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,571
听着，那种被关起来的周末，
So listen,
that weekend lock￡-up,

160
00:08:12,613 --> 00:08:15,157
需要提前几天预约？
how far in advance
is that booked?

161
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:22,759
雷，让我来拎一个吧
You know, Ray,

162
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:24,511

169
00:08:41,611 --> 00:08:43,405
有人吗？
Hello?

170
00:08:43,447 --> 00:08:46,366
“请按海龟”
"Please ring turtle."

00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,333
－噢，你们好啊

￡- Hey.

174
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,130
我是塞丝莉・戴里
很抱歉让你们久等
Cecily Daly.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

175
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:03,050
我刚才在包一些野餐用的叉子
l was packing some folks
a picnic lunch.

176
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:05,010
噢，真浪漫
Oh, that's so romantic.

177
00:09:05,052 --> 00:09:08,138
你喜欢？我们买一个
You like that?
We'll take one of those.

178
00:09:11,058 --> 00:09:13,852
野餐已经订好了，晚上6点钟
Picnic orders have to be in
by 6:00 the night before.

179
00:09:13,894 --> 00:09:16,104
这张单子上都有

180
00:09:17,064 --> 00:09:19,733
噢，好多兔子
Oh, more bunnies.

181
00:09:19,775 --> 00:09:22,944
我想想把登记簿放哪儿了……
Now if l could just remember where
l put the reservation book.

182
00:09:22,986 --> 00:09:24,863
房间里没有电视？
No Tv in the room?

183
00:09:29,868 --> 00:09:32,204
这个周末你真的需要一台电视机吗？
Did you really want a Tv
this weekend?

184
00:09:32,245 --> 00:09:35,290
不了，我们可以扳手腕
No, we'll arm￡-wrestle.

185
00:09:38,877 --> 00:09:40,587
这是你们的钥匙
Here's your key.

186
00:09:42,547 --> 00:09:46,718
公共浴室就在走廊对面
And the common bathroom
is just across the hall.

187
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,887
房间里连浴室也没有？
No bathrooms in
the rooms either?

188
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:50,973
我能问个问题吗？
Can l ask you
something?

189
00:09:51,014 --> 00:09:53,392
房间里有什么？
What is in the room?

190
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:55,852
－我们现在是不是已经在房间里了？

￡- That's great!
￡- Bill, Pam.

192
00:09:58,814 --> 00:10:01,274
我们早餐时没看见你们
We missed you two
at breakfast.

193
00:10:01,316 --> 00:10:03,318
我们吃了蓝莓馅饼
We had blueberry
pancakes.

194
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,529
对不起，我们起不来

￡- Ready to go, babe?
￡- Sure, babe.

196
00:10:10,867 --> 00:10:12,494
你们要去哪儿？
Where you off to?

197
00:10:12,536 --> 00:10:15,497
我们要去克拉佛兹勃利的古代展会结帐
We're gonna check out that antique
fair in Craftsbury Common.

198
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:17,582
我在介绍上看到过，那一定很不错

That's supposed to be great.

199
00:10:17,624 --> 00:10:19,334
再见
See you.

200
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:26,008
你想去那个狡猾的蔓越桔园？
（和克拉佛兹勃利近音）
Did you want to go
to that cranberry crafty land?

201
00:10:28,802 --> 00:10:31,972
今天我已经安排了本和杰瑞的旅行了
Well, l scheduled the Ben & Jerry's

202
00:10:32,014 --> 00:10:33,849
因为你看起来很喜欢这个
'Cause you seemed
so excited about it.

203
00:10:33,849 --> 00:10:36,727
是啊，但如果你不想去
我们不一定非得去的
Yeah, but we don't have to do that
if you don't want to.

204
00:10:36,768 --> 00:10:39,896

这是我们的周末
No, l do.

205
00:10:39,938 --> 00:10:42,441
我们应该做一些大家都喜欢的事情
We're gonna do things
that we both enjoy.

206
00:10:42,482 --> 00:10:44,401
不能感觉我们没有共同点
lt's not like
we have nothing in common.

207
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:47,154
是啊，是啊
公共浴室
Yeah.
Yeah, common bathroom.

208
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:54,870
好了，谁拿走了黄色的小块？
All right, who took
my yellow piece?

209
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:59,291
这不好玩！是我赢了
lt's not funny.

210
00:11:01,668 --> 00:11:03,962
你们知道，拿走我的黄色小块的家伙
Do you know what happened
to the last person

211
00:11:04,004 --> 00:11:05,547
会得到什么下场吗？
who took my yellow piece?

212
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:08,175
－ 怎么？
－ 他们要被挠痒痒！
￡- What?
￡- They got a big tickle, that's what.

213
00:11:10,052 --> 00:11:11,928
我找不到开罐器了

￡- Where's your mother?
￡- l don't know. She's not here.

You want to play

￡- Dad!
￡- Would you stop yelling?

221
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:37,412
开罐器在冰箱最上面的抽屉里

by the refrigerator.

222
00:11:37,454 --> 00:11:38,956

￡- You got the key?

噢不，又是那对情侣

是啊，太棒了
我们步行走过野花园
Yeah, it was great.
We hiked through wildflowers

242

我们只去了克拉佛兹勃利

比尔给我买了床被子

00:13:38,241 --> 00:13:40,911
谁？宝贝和宝贝？

00:13:48,752 --> 00:13:50,921
是啊，他们还没结婚哪
Well they're not
married yet.

260
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,385
所以，要是他们结婚了
该有多么开心啊
So, just think how happy
they're gonna get.

261
00:13:58,553 --> 00:14:01,223
好吧，你要去淋浴吗？
Okay, so are you gonna
shower?

262
00:14:01,264 --> 00:14:03,225
－为什么？
－等会要乘干草马车啊
￡- What for?
￡- For the hayride.

263
00:14:05,268 --> 00:14:07,562
我闻起来有多臭？
How bad do l smell

264
00:14:07,604 --> 00:14:09,606
需要我坐在一匹马拉的车子里，
that l got to take
a shower

265
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:12,484
还要事先洗个澡？
before being dragged around
behind a horse?

266
00:14:14,403 --> 00:14:16,697
我想你是对的，我们不需要淋浴
l guess you're right.
We don't need to shower.

267
00:14:16,738 --> 00:14:19,574
－有时间打个盹吗？
－没时间
￡- ls it time for a nap?
￡- l don't think so.

268
00:14:19,616 --> 00:14:21,451
我们6点半就要下楼了
We've gotta be downstairs
by 6:30.

269
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:24,037
－晚饭怎么办？
－好像是包括在节目里的
￡- What about dinner?
￡- lt's kind of included.

270
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,164
应该是篝火野餐会什么的
lt's sort of a cookout,
campfire thing.

271
00:14:26,206 --> 00:14:29,418
－有什么可吃的？
－我怎么知道有什么可吃的？
￡- What are they having?
￡- l don't know what they're having.

272
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:31,545
我只是觉得那应该会很有趣
l just thought
it would be fun.

273
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:35,048
你知道什么最有趣吗？
打个盹
You know what might
be more fun? A nap.

274
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:40,178
好吧，很好，你打盹吧
尽情打盹吧
Okay, fine, you nap.
Nap all you want.

275
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,973
知道吗？下一次，你来挑这见鬼的旅馆
You know what? The next time
you pick the frickin' hotel

276
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,683
你来安排节目
and you plan
all the activities

277
00:14:44,725 --> 00:14:46,852
然后我来抱怨一切
and l'll be the one
that hates everything!

278
00:14:46,893 --> 00:14:48,854
等等，黛博拉
别这样
Wait, Debra!
Come on.

279
00:14:48,895 --> 00:14:50,981
我没说我讨厌这一切
l didn't say
l hated everything.

280
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,400
－你没必要说
－噢，怎么了
￡- You didn't have to say it.
￡- Oh, what￡-￡-

281
00:14:53,442 --> 00:14:56,236
我做什么了？我怎么了？
what did l do?
What did l do?

282
00:14:56,278 --> 00:14:58,864
我只不过说“有什么可吃的”
我怎么了？
l said what are they having?
What did l do?

283
00:15:00,741 --> 00:15:03,785
拜托！你刚才说有个野餐会
Come on! You said there was going
to be a cookout thing,

284
00:15:03,827 --> 00:15:05,495
于是我就问
“有什么可吃的？”
and l said,
"What are they having?"

285
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:08,165
这个问题很符合逻辑啊！
That's a perfectly
legitimate question.

286
00:15:08,206 --> 00:15:10,751
没什么别的意思
There was no other
meaning there.

287
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:12,753
还有打盹的事情，那只是……
And the nap thing,
that was just￡-￡-

288
00:15:12,753 --> 00:15:15,797
我希望浪漫一点！
仅此而已
that's me trying to be romantic.
That's all.

289
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,759
对不起，我不知道我在干什么
l'm sorry. l don't know what the hell
l'm doing here.

290
00:15:20,177 --> 00:15:23,138
－里面有人吗？
－是的
￡- ls someone in there?
￡- Yeah.

291
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,807
你在想什么？
What do you think?

292
00:15:25,849 --> 00:15:29,394
宝贝，出来吧
别人要用浴室了
Honey, come on. Somebody else
needs to use the bathroom.

293
00:15:29,436 --> 00:15:31,521
宝贝，快啊
Honey, come on.

294
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:34,149
我们不能霸占着浴室
We're not the only one
who has this bathroom.

295
00:15:34,191 --> 00:15:36,526
别忘了，这间只有公共浴室的旅馆
Remember, you're the one
who booked the place

296
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:38,528
可是你订的
with the share￡-
the￡-bathroom thing.

297
00:15:40,697 --> 00:15:42,658
我把事情越搞越糟了，是不是？
l just made it worse,
didn't l?

298
00:15:49,122 --> 00:15:51,083
宝贝，出来吧
Honey, come on.

299
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,126
对不起
l'm sorry.

300
00:15:53,168 --> 00:15:55,671
求你了，出来吧
我们是朋友，嗯？
Please, come on.
Let's be friends, huh?

301
00:15:55,712 --> 00:15:57,798
我们是出来度假啊
This is our
weekend getaway.

302
00:16:00,342 --> 00:16:03,220
来啊，宝贝
开门……
Come on, honey.
Unlock the￡-￡-

303
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:04,930
噢
Oh.

304
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:07,683
门没锁
lt's not locked.

305
00:16:07,724 --> 00:16:10,018
我们只要一会
We'll just be a minute.

306
00:16:14,815 --> 00:16:16,441
嘿
Hey.

307
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,406
你看，这门上没锁
You know, there's no lock
on that thing.

308
00:16:22,447 --> 00:16:25,158
你应该挂那个牌子
You're supposed
to hang the sign.

309
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,122
“耐心是一种美德”
"Patience is a virtue."

310
00:16:35,168 --> 00:16:36,795
怎么了？雷
What, Ray?

311
00:16:36,837 --> 00:16:38,672
没什么，这蛮有意思的
No, nothing.
lt's charming.

312
00:16:38,714 --> 00:16:40,966
很实在
And true.

313
00:16:46,263 --> 00:16:48,849
你想回家吗？
So you wanna
just go home?

314
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:53,020
除非你想
Only if you
really want to.

315
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:59,443
别这样，还没到这种地步吧？
Come on,
it's not really going that well.

316
00:16:59,484 --> 00:17:02,237
除非你这么觉得
Unless you think
that it is.

317
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:05,490
我想让你觉得开心
l was trying to make
this fun for you.

318
00:17:07,117 --> 00:17:09,953
我是说，你以为那些徒步游，
l mean, why￡-￡-
that hike

319
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:12,247
那些苹果园，还有冰激凌工厂
是为了什么？
and the apple orchard
and the ice cream factory￡-￡-

320
00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:15,250
你以为我安排这些傻节目是为了什么？
why do you think l planned
all those stupid things?

321
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,879
等一等，你觉得这些事很傻？
Wait a minute.
You thought they were stupid?

322
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,714
当然了
Of course.

323
00:17:20,756 --> 00:17:23,467
我以为只要让你一直马不停蹄地转
你就不会注意到
l just thought that if l kept you busy
you wouldn't notice￡-￡-

324
00:17:23,508 --> 00:17:25,010
什么？
What?

325
00:17:25,052 --> 00:17:27,095
注意到什么？
Notice what?

326
00:17:27,137 --> 00:17:29,139
注意到你的老婆是多么无趣
That l'm your
boring wife.

327
00:17:30,891 --> 00:17:32,851
什么？无趣的老婆？
What?
Boring wife?

328
00:17:34,102 --> 00:17:36,063
你觉得你让我感到无趣了？
You thought
you'd be boring to me?

329
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,149
有什么好笑的？
What's so funny?

330
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,526
没什么？
Nothing.

331
00:17:42,819 --> 00:17:45,072
你很在意我的感觉
You were nervous
about being boring to me.

332
00:17:48,492 --> 00:17:50,118
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

333
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,788
这很……很好玩
lt's just￡-￡-
it is funny.

334
00:17:52,829 --> 00:17:55,540
你觉得你无趣，那我呢？
You thinking you're boring.
What about me?

335
00:17:55,582 --> 00:17:57,417
在华盛顿桥上，
Come on, l ran out
of things to say

336
00:17:57,417 --> 00:17:59,503
我没话可说的时候，
on the George
Washington Bridge.

337
00:17:59,544 --> 00:18:02,047
还记得吗？
我居然说我习惯走在上层
Remember, l said l always
take the upper level

338
00:18:02,089 --> 00:18:05,384
因为万一桥塌了，我就会跌在下面的人身上
because if it collapses you fall
on the people on the lower level?

339
00:18:06,969 --> 00:18:09,513
这根本是莫明其妙
That doesn't
even make sense.

340
00:18:09,554 --> 00:18:12,057
我们都会掉在河里，然后死掉
We're all gonna die.
We all go in the river.

341
00:18:14,101 --> 00:18:15,727
这太傻了
lt's stupid.

342
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:17,229
是的
Yeah.

343
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,982
还有车子开到100英里时
你居然说，
And there was 100 miles
where all you said was,

344
00:18:20,023 --> 00:18:22,693
“噢看啊，里程表要撞上80000了！”
"Oh look, the odometer
is going to hit 80,000."

345
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:25,279
我就是这个意思！
My point exactly.

346
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,365
这么说我们确实还是有共同点的
So we do have something
in common.

347
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,450
我们都很无趣
We're boring.

348
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,037
嗨，我们是无趣夫妇
Hi, we're the Borings.

349
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,748
我们刚突破了80000
We just hit 80,000.

350
00:18:43,213 --> 00:18:46,633
你想干什么？
想去乘干草马车吗？
What do you want to do?
You want to do the hayride?

351
00:18:46,675 --> 00:18:49,428
知道吗？
You know what?

352
00:18:49,469 --> 00:18:51,054
打个小盹听起来很诱人
That nap sounded
pretty good.

353
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,056
－真的？
－没错
￡- Yeah?
￡- Yeah.

354
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:55,225
自从艾丽出生以后
l've been wanting
to take a nap

355
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:57,561
我就盼着能打个小盹了
since Ally was born.

356
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,357
嘿
Hey.

357
00:19:02,399 --> 00:19:04,693
打个小盹对我来说可不无趣
Nothing boring to me
about a nap.

358
00:19:04,735 --> 00:19:06,695
或许……
You know, and then...

359
00:19:06,737 --> 00:19:08,822
等会还可以……
maybe a little later

360
00:19:08,864 --> 00:19:11,491
－谁知道呢，嗯？
－好吧，肯定了。但先要打个小盹
￡- who knows, huh?
￡- Okay, definitely. But first a nap.

361
00:19:11,491 --> 00:19:13,285
噢，肯定只打个小盹
Oh, definitely a nap.

362
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:17,873
打扰一下，我是塞丝莉
你们没事吧？
Excuse me, it's Cecily.
Everything all right?

363
00:19:17,873 --> 00:19:20,208
是的，我们马上出来了
Yeah, yeah.
We're done.

364
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,210
好吧
Yeah.

365
00:19:22,252 --> 00:19:24,212
噢
Oh.

366
00:19:24,212 --> 00:19:27,215
－你干嘛要那么做？
－我不知道，一下子慌了
￡- Why did you do that?
￡- l don't know, l panicked.

367
00:19:27,257 --> 00:19:29,593
来吧，现在我们该洗手了
Come on, now we got
to wash our hands.

368
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:34,640
嘿，兔子香皂
Hey, bunny soap.

369
00:19:38,101 --> 00:19:40,103
我们为每件事庆祝
We celebrate everything.

370
00:19:52,152 --> 00:19:54,112
几点了？
What time is it?

371
00:19:57,866 --> 00:20:00,201
9:00.
9:00.

372
00:20:02,829 --> 00:20:06,416
－我们错过晚饭了
－嗯，我想是的
￡- We missed dinner.
￡- Mm, l guess.

373
00:20:09,335 --> 00:20:11,546
你想继续睡？
You wanna just sleep
through?

374
00:20:11,588 --> 00:20:14,007
是的
Yes.

375
00:20:16,467 --> 00:20:18,928
这个假期真不错
This is a great vacation.
