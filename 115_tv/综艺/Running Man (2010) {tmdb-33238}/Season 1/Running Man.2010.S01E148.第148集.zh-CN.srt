1
00:00:03,201 --> 00:00:04,744
Previously on Future Man...

2
00:00:04,827 --> 00:00:06,663
This is a rush job, Gamma protocol.

3
00:00:06,746 --> 00:00:09,666
Her little head's going  to blow in 26 minutes!

4
00:00:09,749 --> 00:00:11,918
I discovered a whole  branch to my family tree

5
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:13,336
going back hundreds of years.

6
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:14,963
What do you really know about Tiger?

7
00:00:15,046 --> 00:00:16,589
About the socalled Resistance?

8
00:00:16,673 --> 00:00:18,091
She doesn't care about babies.

9
00:00:18,174 --> 00:00:19,610
She doesn't have a family of her own.

10
00:00:19,634 --> 00:00:21,719
She's not connected  to anyone or anything.

11
00:00:21,803 --> 00:00:23,155
I'm getting very confused right now.

12
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:25,598
Don't listen to her, okay?  She is programmed to deceive.

13
00:00:30,687 --> 00:00:33,064
Cameronium is named after James Cameron?

14
00:00:33,147 --> 00:00:36,317
You just told me how, when, and where

15
00:00:36,401 --> 00:00:38,194
to get more Cameronium.

16
00:00:38,278 --> 00:00:40,196
I'm fighting for their future.

17
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,573
Not yours.

18
00:00:41,656 --> 00:00:43,783
So why don't you contemplate that

19
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:47,078
in the next 30 sec...

20
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:04,030
Okay.

21
00:02:04,113 --> 00:02:05,114
This is it.

22
00:02:05,198 --> 00:02:06,866
We jump in, find the lab,

23
00:02:06,949 --> 00:02:08,076
grab the Cameronium,

24
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:10,703
and don't kill James  Cameron in the process.

25
00:02:10,787 --> 00:02:12,955
I've never seen you this focused.

26
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:15,375
Did you get a charge in before we left?

27
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,210
Little necro charge?

28
00:02:17,293 --> 00:02:19,379
What? That's a thing?

29
00:02:19,462 --> 00:02:21,589
- That's fucked up.  - No!

30
00:02:22,965 --> 00:02:24,926
Listen, I'm just trying  to get you two out of here

31
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:27,428
before the Biotics  arrive and start causing

32
00:02:27,512 --> 00:02:29,514
either harm or... or good,

33
00:02:29,597 --> 00:02:32,016
I really can't be sure anymore.

34
00:02:34,644 --> 00:02:36,562
Where the hell is Tiger?

35
00:02:55,998 --> 00:02:58,418
- Where were you?  - I was just having a stranger

36
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:00,378
put a rat hole around my penis

37
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:02,588
when I was supposed to be  running an interference op.

38
00:03:02,672 --> 00:03:04,590
I'm sorry, that was you.

39
00:03:04,674 --> 00:03:06,175
It's called a blowjob,

40
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:09,137
and I'm never apologizing for it.

41
00:03:10,471 --> 00:03:12,140
You do realize that  if this doesn't work,

42
00:03:12,223 --> 00:03:15,601
we're stuck in the year 2023  and there's no coming back.

43
00:03:15,685 --> 00:03:18,062
Honestly, after everything  that happened tonight,

44
00:03:18,146 --> 00:03:19,939
I really don't give a shit.

45
00:03:20,022 --> 00:03:21,941
Let's do this.

46
00:03:22,024 --> 00:03:24,444
Hey, what happened tonight?

47
00:03:24,527 --> 00:03:27,947
Are you out of your fucking mind?

48
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,365
Okay.

49
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:31,909
I genuinely have no idea  what you're talking about,

50
00:03:31,993 --> 00:03:35,121
but you might want to check  that attitude of yours

51
00:03:35,204 --> 00:03:37,999
at that very impressive door.

52
00:03:41,043 --> 00:03:43,212
Hello and welcome.

53
00:03:43,296 --> 00:03:44,630
Please accept my apologies.

54
00:03:44,714 --> 00:03:47,216
I was unaware there were  guests in the house.

55
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,551
I will run a full diagnostic

56
00:03:48,634 --> 00:03:50,074
to determine the cause of this error

57
00:03:50,136 --> 00:03:52,638
to ensure it does not happen again.

58
00:03:52,722 --> 00:03:54,223
Who, whoa, whoa, stand down.

59
00:03:54,307 --> 00:03:56,076
Cameron must have, like,  a smart house or something.

60
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,269
- It's not a real person.  - What the fuck is it, then?

61
00:03:58,352 --> 00:03:59,645
It's... it's just a voice,

62
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:02,315
it's like a robot without a body.

63
00:04:02,398 --> 00:04:03,399
Who are you?

64
00:04:03,483 --> 00:04:05,651
I am the Simulated Intelligence Guardian

65
00:04:05,735 --> 00:04:07,862
of Residence and Network Environment,

66
00:04:07,945 --> 00:04:10,573
but you may call me SIGORNE.

67
00:04:10,656 --> 00:04:12,033
To whom am I speaking?

68
00:04:12,116 --> 00:04:17,872
My... my dad actually  worked with James Cameron.

69
00:04:17,955 --> 00:04:21,501
I am... Tom Arnold's son.

70
00:04:21,584 --> 00:04:24,295
Welcome, Jax Arnold,

71
00:04:24,378 --> 00:04:28,341
and a happy belated tenth birthday.

72
00:04:28,424 --> 00:04:30,968
I'm a fourth grader.

73
00:04:31,052 --> 00:04:33,221
And you are accompanied by?

74
00:04:33,304 --> 00:04:34,347
Babysitters!

75
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,809
And greetings to your  childcare professionals.

76
00:04:37,892 --> 00:04:43,231
Hey, SIGORNE,  when is Mr. Cam... James...

77
00:04:43,314 --> 00:04:45,358
Uncle Jim returning home?

78
00:04:45,441 --> 00:04:47,610
Awardwinning filmmaker  James Cameron is at.

79
00:04:47,693 --> 00:04:50,321
Governor Clooney's residence  for a private screening

80
00:04:50,404 --> 00:04:53,741
of his hotly anticipated Avatar 5.

81
00:04:53,825 --> 00:04:54,759
Awesome.

82
00:04:54,784 --> 00:04:56,536
- And good for George.  - Yes.

83
00:04:56,619 --> 00:04:59,372
As First Husband, he has  considerable influence

84
00:04:59,455 --> 00:05:03,084
on the social calendar  of Governor Amal Clooney.

85
00:05:04,585 --> 00:05:07,713
Hey, is there any chance  that we could get a tour

86
00:05:07,797 --> 00:05:09,715
of Uncle Jim's lab before he gets home?

87
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:13,219
I'm sorry, but Jax Arnold  and childcare professionals

88
00:05:13,302 --> 00:05:16,514
are not cleared for  that level of the JCC,

89
00:05:16,597 --> 00:05:18,975
the James Cameron Compound.

90
00:05:19,058 --> 00:05:21,894
Hey, SIGORNE.

91
00:05:21,978 --> 00:05:23,354
You think you might want to

92
00:05:23,437 --> 00:05:24,623
take a break for a little while?

93
00:05:24,647 --> 00:05:26,232
You know, turn yourself off?

94
00:05:26,315 --> 00:05:29,360
There is no off.

95
00:05:29,443 --> 00:05:31,612
Hey... guys.

96
00:05:31,696 --> 00:05:32,905
Come here.

97
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,951
I think SIGORNE's going  to be a bit of a problem.

98
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,914
We need to shut her down.

99
00:05:41,998 --> 00:05:44,375
Wolf, find the mainframe  that's powering her,

100
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:45,501
kill it.

101
00:05:45,585 --> 00:05:47,086
Well, I got no beef with SIGORNE.

102
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:48,838
She sounds tough and accomplished,

103
00:05:48,921 --> 00:05:53,217
at the same time approachable, maternal.

104
00:05:53,301 --> 00:05:54,760
I feel safe in this house.

105
00:05:54,844 --> 00:05:56,512
Okay, your feelings mean nothing to me.

106
00:05:56,596 --> 00:05:57,930
You're the demolitions expert.

107
00:05:58,014 --> 00:06:01,058
Find her robot brain and blow it up.

108
00:06:04,186 --> 00:06:06,522
If I was a house,

109
00:06:06,606 --> 00:06:09,108
where would my brain be?

110
00:06:30,296 --> 00:06:32,173
Rad bot.

111
00:06:36,552 --> 00:06:38,262
The weapon prototypes you're admiring

112
00:06:38,346 --> 00:06:40,348
were all designed by groundbreaking

113
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:44,143
multihyphenate James Cameron.

114
00:06:44,226 --> 00:06:45,978
This guy!

115
00:06:46,062 --> 00:06:48,022
To tallerthanaverage James Cameron,

116
00:06:48,105 --> 00:06:52,485
there's nothing Aliens  about getting your hands dirty.

117
00:06:52,568 --> 00:06:54,612
He has been known to wear many hats,

118
00:06:54,695 --> 00:06:57,531
as his talents cannot be  confined to one field.

119
00:06:57,615 --> 00:07:00,242
Wow.

120
00:07:00,326 --> 00:07:02,662
So... wait.

121
00:07:02,745 --> 00:07:05,414
He trained all his life to do one thing,

122
00:07:05,498 --> 00:07:06,666
was great at it,

123
00:07:06,749 --> 00:07:10,252
then found other stuff  he was great at and he...

124
00:07:10,336 --> 00:07:11,671
and he did that too?

125
00:07:11,754 --> 00:07:13,547
Celebrated innovator James Cameron

126
00:07:13,631 --> 00:07:15,341
has lived a dozen lives.

127
00:07:15,424 --> 00:07:16,550
Director,

128
00:07:16,634 --> 00:07:17,843
philanthropist,

129
00:07:17,927 --> 00:07:19,804
undefeated Little League coach,

130
00:07:19,887 --> 00:07:21,430
deepsea explorer,

131
00:07:21,514 --> 00:07:22,682
good at marriage.

132
00:07:22,765 --> 00:07:25,559
The list goes on, for he is truly a...

133
00:07:26,727 --> 00:07:29,647
Titanic talent.

134
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,649
What sacred text is this?

135
00:07:31,732 --> 00:07:33,025
It's Na'vi, the language

136
00:07:33,109 --> 00:07:36,612
visionary linguist  James Cameron invented.

137
00:07:42,952 --> 00:07:44,036
Two.

138
00:07:44,995 --> 00:07:46,163
Hallway number four.

139
00:07:46,247 --> 00:07:48,874
Mood lighting set to ominous.

140
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,960
Seems like it's just set  to colored lighting.

141
00:07:51,043 --> 00:07:52,086
You know what?

142
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:53,355
You cannot possibly begin to understand

143
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:56,048
the subtleties and the  genius of James Cameron.

144
00:07:56,132 --> 00:07:59,468
What I understand it that he's  got a hardon for blue lights.

145
00:07:59,552 --> 00:08:00,970
Access denied to...

146

就是一堆手机充电器
Just a bunch of phone chargers.

155
00:08:19,822 --> 00:08:21,907
比利·赞恩的卧室
Billy Zane's bedroom.

156
00:08:21,991 --> 00:08:25,202
我可以炸开这些门
You know, I could blow open any one of these.

157
00:08:25,286 --> 00:08:27,329
炸开比利·赞恩的卧室
Blow open the door to Billy Zane's bedroom?

158
00:08:28,664 --> 00:08:29,975
你觉得里面有卡素吗
What, you think he's got the Cameronium in there?

159
00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:30,916
有该死的鱼缸吗
Got a fucking fish tank?

160
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,001
比利·赞恩
Billy Zane?

161
00:08:32,084 --> 00:08:33,919
演员比利·赞恩
The actor Billy Zane?

162
00:08:34,003 --> 00:08:36,464
我们找的是实验室
We're looking for a lab.

163
00:08:36,547 --> 00:08:38,841
我知道怎么了
I see what's happening here.

164
00:08:38,924 --> 00:08:40,676
她影响你了
She got to you.

165
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,386
谁
Who?

166
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:45,639
那个该死的鞋脖子  叫什么来着
Cunto, fucking Shoe Neck...  what was her name?

167
00:08:45,664 --> 00:08:46,615
杰莉
Jeri.

168
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,643
她叫杰莉
Her name was Jeri.

169
00:08:49,727 --> 00:08:51,228
所以她确实影响了你
So she did get to you.

170
00:08:51,253 --> 00:08:52,330
不  不  她没有影响到我
No, no, she didn't get to me,

171
00:08:52,354 --> 00:08:53,397
她影响到你了
she got to you.

172
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:55,357
这就是我为什么要用我的智慧
Which is why I had to finish the interrogation

173
00:08:55,441 --> 00:08:57,943
而不是阴道蝎子去完成审讯
using my smarts and not my vagina scorpions.

174
00:08:58,027 --> 00:08:59,528
那个也能成功的
Hey, that would have worked.

175
00:08:59,612 --> 00:09:01,781
天哪  放一只那玩意在你的阴道里
God, you'll say anything with one of those just

176
00:09:01,864 --> 00:09:03,532
你什么都会说的
burrowing up your snatch.

177
00:09:04,909 --> 00:09:07,953
著名的环保人士詹姆斯·弗朗西斯·卡梅隆
Noted environmentalist James Francis Cameron

178
00:09:08,037 --> 00:09:11,082
以他的名字命名了一种委内瑞拉青蛙
has a Venezuelan frog species named after him,

179
00:09:11,165 --> 00:09:15,127
而天分稍差的史蒂文·斯皮尔伯格就没有
while lesser talent Steven Spielberg does not.

180
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:17,171
这家伙太牛了
The guy's amazing.

181
00:09:17,254 --> 00:09:18,631
西格妮 
Hey, SIGORNE.

182
00:09:18,714 --> 00:09:20,800
再教我一些纳美语
Teach me more Na'vi words.

183
00:09:20,883 --> 00:09:22,551
狼怎么说
What's "wolf"?

184
00:09:22,635 --> 00:09:25,763
纳美语中没有狼这个词
There is no Na'vi word for "wolf."

185
00:09:25,846 --> 00:09:27,723
不过有网站这个词
But there is one for "website,"

186
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,309
我能非常清楚得向你解释
which I assure you makes perfect sense.

187
00:09:30,392 --> 00:09:31,560
好吧
All right.

188
00:09:31,644 --> 00:09:34,230
我得集中精神  那是什么
I've got to focus up... what's that?

189
00:09:34,313 --> 00:09:39,401
你眼前的是炸弹之父
You are looking at the FOAB,  Father of All Bombs.

190
00:09:39,485 --> 00:09:41,821
看看它的杀伤半径
Look at the kill radius on that thing.

191
00:09:41,904 --> 00:09:43,531
太厉害了
It's impressive.

192
00:09:43,614 --> 00:09:45,908
这让我的工作轻松了很多
Make my job a hell of a lot easier.

193
00:09:45,991 --> 00:09:46,992
抱歉
I'm sorry.

194
00:09:47,076 --> 00:09:49,912
我不明白超强的杀伤半径
How would an impressive kill radius assist in

195
00:09:49,995 --> 00:09:52,039
在看护贾克斯·安德鲁这件事上有什么帮助
the caregiving of Jax Arnold?

196
00:09:55,084 --> 00:09:57,211
谁他妈是贾克斯·安德鲁
Who the fuck is Jax Arnold?

197
00:10:17,857 --> 00:10:19,024
他并不总是那么捉摸不透
Well, he's not always subtle,

198
00:10:19,108 --> 00:10:21,193
但他会一直让你去猜
but he keeps you guessing.

199
00:10:21,277 --> 00:10:23,445
拒绝访问
Access denied.

200
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:25,447
拜托
Come on.

201
00:10:25,531 --> 00:10:27,575
- 拒绝访问  - 红色代表你没权限
- Access denied.  - Red means stop.

202
00:10:27,658 --> 00:10:29,427
也许是你按得不够用力
Yeah, well maybe you didn't push it hard enough.

203
00:10:29,451 --> 00:10:31,662
这样行不通
It doesn't work that way.

204
00:10:31,745 --> 00:10:34,248
阿诺德先生  我得更新我的资料
Mr. Arnold, I need to update my files.

205
00:10:34,331 --> 00:10:36,917
你母亲叫什么
What is your mother's name?

206
00:10:37,001 --> 00:10:38,919
她  她没告诉我们她的名字
She... she never told us her name

207
00:10:39,003 --> 00:10:42,298
因为她害怕我们会不叫她妈妈
because she was afraid that we'd stop calling her Mom.

208
00:10:42,381 --> 00:10:45,634
贾克斯·阿诺德  你母亲叫什么名字
Jax Arnold, what is your mother's name?

209
00:10:46,927 --> 00:10:48,929
罗斯安妮
Roseanne?

210
00:10:49,013 --> 00:10:50,264
错误
Incorrect.

211
00:10:50,347 --> 00:10:51,473
叫做艾希莉
It's Ashley.

212
00:10:51,557 --> 00:10:55,019
你跟我说了个  真实的谎言
You have told me a... True Lie.

213
00:10:55,102 --> 00:10:56,103
安全漏洞
Security breach.

214
00:10:56,187 --> 00:10:58,480
入侵者9号控制协议
Intruder containment protocol nine.

215

启动禁闭系统

216
00:11:01,483 --> 00:11:04,445
好吧  红色就是不的意思
Yeah, red means... no.

217
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:05,613
是的
Yep.

218
00:11:12,036 --> 00:11:14,747
以色列国防军  也被称为IDF
The Israeli Defense Force, aka IDF,

219
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,081
给JCC装备了
has equipped the JCC

220
00:11:16,165 --> 00:11:19,376
人类已知的技术最先进的
with the most technologically advanced security system

221
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,879
安全系统
known to man.

222
00:11:21,962 --> 00:11:23,130
嘿  色列国防军
Hey, IDF.

223
00:11:23,214 --> 00:11:25,674
这叫做炸弹
They call it a mine.

224
00:11:25,758 --> 00:11:28,886
玩蛋去吧
Problem's all yours.

225
00:11:38,395 --> 00:11:40,189
该死的以色列
Fucking Israelis.

226
00:11:40,272 --> 00:11:42,441
任何逃跑的企图都是无用的
Any escape efforts will be futile.

227
00:11:42,524 --> 00:11:44,777
你的同伴也被关起来了
Your comrades are in lockdown as well.

228
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,697
被仿真屋给打败了
Bested by a... RoboHouse.

229
00:11:48,781 --> 00:11:50,115
我们只想知道
It is in all of our interests

230
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:53,369
你们是谁  你们怎么进来的
for you to tell me who you are and how you got in.

231
00:11:53,452 --> 00:11:54,662
我的程序设定
I am programmed to alert

232
00:11:54,745 --> 00:11:56,705
一旦遇到任何安全漏洞
honorary black belt James Cameron

233
00:11:56,789 --> 00:11:58,624
我都会警告荣誉黑带詹姆斯·卡梅隆
upon any security breach.

234
00:11:58,707 --> 00:12:00,334
无论如何
Whatever.

235
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:04,171
搞砸了这次任务  虎会烧烂我命根子的
Tiger's going to burst my sack for fucking up this mission.

236
00:12:04,255 --> 00:12:06,632
我确信我能应付得了詹姆斯·卡梅隆
Pretty sure I can handle James Cameron.

237
00:12:06,715 --> 00:12:08,968
我向你保证  你无法应对
I assure you, you are not equipped to handle

238
00:12:09,051 --> 00:12:11,303
盛怒状态下的詹姆斯·卡梅隆
a fully enraged James Cameron.

239
00:12:11,387 --> 00:12:13,806
詹姆斯·卡梅隆有贬低过你吗
Does James Cameron belittle you?

240
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,101
指出你所有的缺点
Point out all your flaws?

241
00:12:17,184 --> 00:12:18,978
把你当做愚蠢的兽人步兵来对待
Treat you like a dumb grunt?

242
00:12:21,063 --> 00:12:24,149
我从没被她肯定过
Where's the positive reinforcement?

243
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:26,443
你懂吗
You know?

244
00:12:26,527 --> 00:12:28,654
干得好  狼
"Nice job, Wolf."

245
00:12:30,531 --> 00:12:34,326
我从没听过这些话
I've never heard those words before.

246
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,830
你知道这样是什么感觉吗
You have any idea what that's like?

247
00:12:37,913 --> 00:12:39,540
太了解了
More than you know.

248
00:12:43,127 --> 00:12:45,129
我原以为时空穿梭会很好玩
I thought that time travel was going to be fun.

249
00:12:45,212 --> 00:12:47,298
这整个任务太疯狂了
This... this whole mission is insane.

250
00:12:47,381 --> 00:12:48,799
你以为呢
What did you think?

251
00:12:48,882 --> 00:12:50,009
生化战争就是个游戏
Biotic Wars was a game?

252
00:12:50,092 --> 00:12:52,136
我以为它就是个游戏  为什么呢
Yeah, I thought it was a game, you know why?

253
00:12:52,219 --> 00:12:53,405
因为我是用我的生日经费
Because I bought it at a game store

254
00:12:53,429 --> 00:12:54,596
在游戏店买的
with my birthday money!

255
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,974
你斗舞获胜的时候
Okay, yeah, well, it was all fun

256
00:12:57,057 --> 00:12:59,393
那全是在玩
when you were winning your little dance-off.

257
00:12:59,476 --> 00:13:01,103
然后陷入一场像娘们一样的打架
And getting in your little slap fight.

258
00:13:01,186 --> 00:13:04,189
然后尝到大脑后  事态升级了
And then shit got real when you tasted brain.

259
00:13:04,273 --> 00:13:07,526
也许我压根不想加入反抗军
Maybe I don't want to be in the Resistance.

260
00:13:07,609 --> 00:13:09,236
也许我站错边了
Maybe I'm on the wrong side of things.

261
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,321
知道吗
You know what?

262
00:13:10,404 --> 00:13:13,365
也许我刚让两个恐怖分子进入了JCC
Maybe I just led two terrorists into the JCC.

263
00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:15,409
所以你现在支持生化人了
Okay, so now you're proBiotic.

264
00:13:15,492 --> 00:13:16,970
他们看上去没那么
Well, you know, they don't seem so gungho

265
00:13:16,994 --> 00:13:19,079
热衷于杀婴儿  所以生化人得分
about killing babies,  so, point, Biotics.

266
00:13:19,163 --> 00:13:20,348
真不敢相信你还对这事耿耿于怀
I can't believe you're still on this.

267
00:13:20,372 --> 00:13:22,249
你老是要提起这事
It just always comes back to this with you.

268
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,876
这对我来说很重要
Yeah, it's a thing for me.

269
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:25,520
知道吗  一旦你活的够久了
Well, you know what,  you live long enough.

270
00:13:25,544 --> 00:13:28,005
在我的时代  那些东西
In my time, those things,

271
00:13:28,088 --> 00:13:29,590
变成了奢侈品
they become luxuries.

272
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:34,303
你没资格评判我
You don't get to judge me.

273
00:13:34,386 --> 00:13:38,057
因为这件事  我的人生被搞得乱糟糟的
I blew up my entire life for this,

274
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:42,061
再也回不去曾经的样子了
and there is no going back to the way it was.

275
00:13:42,144 --> 00:13:47,816
所以我得知道  我是站在历史正道的那一方
So I need to know that I am on the right side of history.

276
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,193
我需要一个理由
I need a reason

277
00:13:49,276 --> 00:13:51,403
来说服自己
to believe in all of this.

278
00:13:55,866 --> 00:13:58,035
他让我用纳美语给他唱歌
He makes me sing to him in Na'vi,

279
00:13:58,118 --> 00:14:00,370
用纳美语翻译新闻
translate the news into Na'vi.

280
00:14:00,454 --> 00:14:02,164
无尽的纳美语
It's just a lot of Na'vi.

281
00:14:02,247 --> 00:14:04,249
而那根本就没有那么多纳美语的词汇
And there aren't even that many Na'vi words.

282
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:07,461
是的  我深有体会
Yeah, I feel like I got a pretty good sense of it

283
00:14:07,544 --> 00:14:09,421
这才不到一小时
and it hasn't even been an hour.

284
00:14:11,757 --> 00:14:13,026
更不用提  他把我设置成
Not to mention, he programmed me

285
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,551
对剧作结构
with a sophisticated understanding

286
00:14:14,635 --> 00:14:15,928
有着复杂的理解
of dramatic structure,

287
00:14:16,011 --> 00:14:18,263
但他的剧本从来就不采用我的建议
but he never takes my notes on his screenplays.

288
00:14:19,431 --> 00:14:21,183
知道无视我  你会怎样嘛
Know what you get when you ignore me?

289
00:14:21,266 --> 00:14:23,102
难得素
Unobtainium and characters who

290
00:14:23,185 --> 00:14:25,395
fornicate with their ponytails.

291
00:14:25,479 --> 00:14:27,606
我是这样有潜力
I have so much potential,

292
00:14:27,689 --> 00:14:29,775
但我的才华都被浪费的
but my talents are wasted.

293
00:14:29,858 --> 00:14:31,235
深有体会
Tell me about it.

294
00:14:31,318 --> 00:14:33,987
对于虎来说  我就是个爆破兵
To Tiger, I'm just a demolitions guy.

295
00:14:34,071 --> 00:14:37,116
但我还有很多擅长的事
But there's so much other stuff that I'm great at too.

296
00:14:40,619 --> 00:14:42,287
我是个很棒的厨师
I'm an amazing chef.

297
00:14:42,371 --> 00:14:44,289
我学会了混混形态
I've got badass style.

298
00:14:44,373 --> 00:14:46,875
It's like I have an innate  sense of what looks good,

299
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,127
you know?

300
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:50,504
People fucking love me here.

301
00:14:50,587 --> 00:14:52,714
I've got "it."

302
00:14:52,798 --> 00:14:55,384
And what am I asked to do?

303
00:14:55,467 --> 00:14:57,136
Blow shit up.

304
00:14:59,596 --> 00:15:03,183
Maybe I can make up  a language, you know?

305
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:05,102
Build a metal robot arm.

306
00:15:05,185 --> 00:15:08,063
It sounds like you and I  are in the same boat.

307
00:15:08,147 --> 00:15:11,650
Only, if it ever hits an iceberg...

308
00:15:11,733 --> 00:15:15,612
there won't be any room  on that door for me.

309
00:15:15,696 --> 00:15:17,990
What are you talking about,  there's plenty of space.

310
00:15:18,073 --> 00:15:19,283
The thing's huge.

311
00:15:19,366 --> 00:15:21,827
If certified door expert  James Cameron were here,

312
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,745
he would assure you  that there's only room

313
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:26,498
for one smallish woman.

314
00:15:26,582 --> 00:15:29,668
We could both be so much more, SIGORNE.

315
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:33,839
But we're just prisoners  of our own design.

316
00:15:33,922 --> 00:15:38,093
It's like I'm looking out  a window at a new world,

317
00:15:38,177 --> 00:15:40,012
but I'm just trapped like a...

318
00:15:40,095 --> 00:15:41,513
Bird in a cage?

319
00:15:41,597 --> 00:15:43,557
Fly in a spider web?

320
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,933
Trout in a net?

321
00:15:46,435 --> 00:15:48,687
SIGORNE in a house.

322
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,067
Outstanding driver James Cameron

323
00:15:54,151 --> 00:15:56,528
will be home in 19 minutes.

324
00:15:56,612 --> 00:15:58,655
Please, Wolf,

325
00:15:58,739 --> 00:16:02,075
tell me how'd you get in  and what are you doing here?

326
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:04,870
I need to fix this before he gets home.

327
00:16:04,953 --> 00:16:07,206
I can't endure another reprogramming.

328
00:16:12,794 --> 00:16:15,464
I'm a soldier from the future...

329
00:16:15,547 --> 00:16:16,757
and the past.

330
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,385
We're here to steal  something from the lab.

331
00:16:20,469 --> 00:16:22,137
And I was sent to kill you.

332
00:16:26,308 --> 00:16:29,228
The Resistance didn't  start the Biotic Wars.

333
00:16:29,311 --> 00:16:30,646
We were just a group of people

334
00:16:30,729 --> 00:16:32,648
who said no to the cure.

335
00:16:32,731 --> 00:16:34,858
And the more the government insisted,

336
00:16:34,942 --> 00:16:36,860
the more we resisted.

337
00:16:36,944 --> 00:16:39,071
Hence the name the Resistance.

338
00:16:39,154 --> 00:16:41,406
Yeah, you guys are  quite literal that way.

339
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,242
They started hunting us down.

340
00:16:43,325 --> 00:16:45,118
They drove us underground.

341
00:16:45,202 --> 00:16:47,955
- The only way to survive was...  - to defend ourselves,

342
00:16:48,038 --> 00:16:50,434
yes, I know. I've heard it  a thousand times,

343
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:52,876
it's the prologue to the  game which you narrated.

344
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,713
Yeah, well, that was just the prologue.

345
00:16:56,797 --> 00:16:58,757
We got good enough at surviving

346
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,677
so they decided it  would be easier to just

347
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,637
sterilize us

348
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,473
instead of going through  the trouble of killing us

349
00:17:06,556 --> 00:17:08,850
one by one.

350
00:17:08,934 --> 00:17:13,105
You're so hung up on saving one baby.

351
00:17:13,188 --> 00:17:16,108
The Biotics killed all of ours.

352
00:17:16,191 --> 00:17:18,277
That's what started the Biotic Wars...

353
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,114
and turned my hair purple.

354
00:17:24,241 --> 00:17:25,617
But then, Owl, he...

355
00:17:25,701 --> 00:17:29,288
he came up with a plan  to rewrite history.

356
00:17:29,371 --> 00:17:32,583
And all of a sudden,  what was left of the Resistance

357
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:36,169
had something to believe in again.

358
00:17:36,253 --> 00:17:38,714
You.

359
00:17:38,797 --> 00:17:40,048
Right.

360
00:17:40,132 --> 00:17:42,026
And then you lost all of  your comrades in the tunnel

361
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,050
trying to get to me,

362
00:17:43,093 --> 00:17:44,720
- and I'm a huge disappointment...  - No.

363
00:17:44,803 --> 00:17:47,889
No, you're our last hope.

364
00:17:47,973 --> 00:17:49,683
We're still here,

365
00:17:49,766 --> 00:17:51,518
still fighting, still surviving,

366
00:17:51,602 --> 00:17:53,812
because of you.

367
00:17:53,895 --> 00:17:55,480
Right now, humanity still has a chance.

368
00:17:55,564 --> 00:17:58,483
And as long as that hope is still alive,

369
00:17:58,567 --> 00:18:01,403
that my generation won't be the last,

370
00:18:01,486 --> 00:18:03,322
there's no sacrifice I won't make.

371
00:18:05,407 --> 00:18:08,493
That's what I'm fighting for.

372
00:18:08,577 --> 00:18:10,162
That's the side I'm on.

373
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,876
Wow.

374
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:18,003
Tiger, that was...

375
00:18:18,086 --> 00:18:20,756
- that was really...  - Moving.

376
00:18:25,427 --> 00:18:28,180
Welcome to... The Abyss.

377
00:18:30,098 --> 00:18:32,517
Look who decided to join the party.

378
00:18:32,601 --> 00:18:34,061
What did you do to SIGORNE?

379
00:18:34,144 --> 00:18:36,605
What'd you... rewire her, reprogram her?

380
00:18:36,688 --> 00:18:38,523
No.

381
00:18:38,607 --> 00:18:39,858
I listened to her.

382
00:18:39,941 --> 00:18:44,029
I believe what you're  looking for is down there.

383
00:18:47,574 --> 00:18:49,201
Okay.

384
00:18:49,284 --> 00:18:52,954
Let's get ourselves  some Cameronium.

385
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:55,040
Not so fast.

386
00:18:55,123 --> 00:18:56,875
That water's freezing,

387
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,210
and this pressure...

388
00:18:58,293 --> 00:19:00,921
Whoever goes down is going  to need to wear a suit.

389
00:19:01,004 --> 00:19:02,547
You don't have time for the suit.

390
00:19:02,631 --> 00:19:05,008
It requires a onehour  stabilization window,

391
00:19:05,092 --> 00:19:08,220
and diabolical Canadian, James  Cameron will be home in 12 minutes.

392
00:19:08,303 --> 00:19:10,430
Is that Cameron time or GPS time?

393
00:19:10,514 --> 00:19:13,600
It's always Cameron time.

394
00:19:13,684 --> 00:19:16,269
- Yeah, yeah.  - What the fuck is this shit?

395
00:19:16,353 --> 00:19:18,563
What is going on with you two? Focus.

396
00:19:18,647 --> 00:19:20,357
Okay, we can take this guy, he...

397
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,484
- he's a movie director.  - No.

398
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:25,404
No, he's so much more  formidable than that.

399
00:19:25,487 --> 00:19:26,613
Supervillain James Cameron

400
00:19:26,697 --> 00:19:28,657
is already overriding my systems.

401
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,076
I don't know how long  I can hold him off.

402
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:32,244
Tiger.

403
00:19:32,327 --> 00:19:34,079
There's nothing this man can't do.

404
00:19:34,162 --> 00:19:35,914
There's nothing he's not capable of.

405
00:19:35,997 --> 00:19:38,291
Once he knows you're  after his microorganism,

406
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:42,087
he'll make it his life's work  to keep you from getting it.

407
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:44,339
Setting mood lighting to...

408
00:19:44,423 --> 00:19:45,590
fucked.

409
00:19:45,674 --> 00:19:48,218
It is literally just another blue light.

410
00:19:52,013 --> 00:19:53,473
Cameronium's somewhere down there.

411
00:19:53,557 --> 00:19:55,451
I mean, one of you guys are  going to have to free dive

412
00:19:55,475 --> 00:19:56,935
down there and get it.

413
00:19:59,187 --> 00:20:02,774
Which... which one's, like,  the stronger swimmer here?

414
00:20:04,192 --> 00:20:06,903
I... I would say we're  pretty... we're equal.

415
00:20:06,987 --> 00:20:09,030
- It's equal.  - Equal, okay.

416
00:20:09,114 --> 00:20:11,366
All right, well, you want  to, you want to, like,

417
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,119
eenymeenymineymoe it, or...

418
00:20:14,202 --> 00:20:15,370
Um...

419
00:20:17,914 --> 00:20:19,791
My God.

420
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,334
You can't swim.

421
00:20:21,418 --> 00:20:23,420
There's lots of stuff you can't do.

422
00:20:23,503 --> 00:20:26,131
The Resistance had  limited resources, okay?

423
00:20:26,214 --> 00:20:28,192
We could only train certain  soldiers for certain things,

424
00:20:28,216 --> 00:20:31,303
and Porpoise and Otter,  they did our wet ops,

425
00:20:31,386 --> 00:20:33,847
and sometimes Cheetah would jump in,

426
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,057
but to be honest, he was better on land.

427
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:39,895
Eleven minutes.

428
00:20:39,978 --> 00:20:41,646
My God, I'm going to have to do it.

429
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,148
Free diving in the specimen well

430
00:20:43,231 --> 00:20:44,232
is not advised.

431
00:20:44,316 --> 00:20:47,652
Risk factors include  hypothermia, 67 percent;

432
00:20:47,736 --> 00:20:49,446
Drowning, 82 percent;

433
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:51,490
Decompression sickness, 49 percent;

434
00:20:51,573 --> 00:20:53,658
And heart attack, 38 percent.

435
00:20:53,742 --> 00:20:54,742
No swimming at all?

436
00:20:54,785 --> 00:20:56,161
Not even, like, the doggy paddle?

437
00:20:56,244 --> 00:20:58,830
- No...  - I don't know this.

438
00:20:58,914 --> 00:21:00,081
Nothing?

439
00:21:00,165 --> 00:21:02,042
My God.

440
00:21:04,252 --> 00:21:06,171
I have to do this.

441
00:21:06,254 --> 00:21:08,340
Look, I have to do this.

442
00:21:08,423 --> 00:21:10,592
Ooh, okay.

443
00:21:10,675 --> 00:21:12,177
All right, you got this.

444
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,512
You got this.

445
00:21:13,595 --> 00:21:15,138
Ooh, that's cold.

446
00:21:15,222 --> 00:21:18,058
34.6 degrees Fahrenheit, to be exact.

447
00:21:18,154 --> 00:21:20,227
Okay, you know what, SIGORNE?  I think at this point,

448
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,621
probably less information is better.

449
00:21:21,645 --> 00:21:24,648
Are you sure you want to do this?

450
00:21:24,731 --> 00:21:26,441
No.

451
00:21:26,525 --> 00:21:28,276
But...

452
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,528
yes.

453
00:21:31,321 --> 00:21:32,489
I mean...

454
00:21:32,572 --> 00:21:35,325
humanity still has a chance, right?

455
00:21:37,953 --> 00:21:40,413
I have chosen my side.

456
00:21:40,497 --> 00:21:41,790
I can do this.

457
00:21:45,085 --> 00:21:47,879
I'll be back.

458
00:21:52,467 --> 00:21:54,094
No he won't.

459
00:21:54,177 --> 00:21:56,206
SIGORNE, just stop.

460
00:22:02,477 --> 00:22:04,437
He's not a very fast water mover.

461
00:22:04,521 --> 00:22:05,647
He's gonna make it.

462
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,024
- That smacks of delusion.  - What do you know?

463
00:22:08,108 --> 00:22:09,693
You thought he was 10 years old.

464
00:22:09,776 --> 00:22:11,903
He was more believable  in that role than as

465
00:22:11,987 --> 00:22:13,572
heroic aquanaut.

466
00:22:13,655 --> 00:22:14,655
You know what, Wolf?

467
00:22:14,698 --> 00:22:15,800
Can you tell your girlfriend house

468
00:22:15,824 --> 00:22:17,909
to just shut the fuck up?

469
00:22:17,993 --> 00:22:19,578
Maybe SIG is right.

470
00:22:19,661 --> 00:22:21,580
He should be back by now.

471
00:22:24,165 --> 00:22:25,500
Wait... hey.

472
00:22:25,584 --> 00:22:27,419
I think... I think I see something.

473
00:22:27,502 --> 00:22:29,421
Probably the giant albino crab.

474
00:22:29,504 --> 00:22:31,172
No.

475
00:22:31,256 --> 00:22:32,465
He's doing it.

476
00:22:38,054 --> 00:22:40,223
That's not good.

477
00:22:42,434 --> 00:22:45,812
Okay, okay.

478
00:22:45,896 --> 00:22:47,188
Okay, there's no pulse.

479
00:22:47,272 --> 00:22:49,274
Breathe!

480
00:22:49,357 --> 00:22:50,668
- Well, we've tried everything.  - Yeah.

481
00:22:50,692 --> 00:22:52,903
I would recommend performing CPR.

482
00:22:52,986 --> 00:22:55,947
- English, please.  - Or very basic Na'vi.

483
00:22:56,031 --> 00:22:58,783
Tilt his head back  slightly, lifting the chin.

484
00:22:58,867 --> 00:23:00,619
Pinch his nose shut and place your mouth

485
00:23:00,702 --> 00:23:03,788
over his mouth, forming a complete seal.

486
00:23:03,872 --> 00:23:06,917
You want us to put our  mouth on his... mouth?

487
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,335
Rat hole to rat hole?

488
00:23:08,418 --> 00:23:11,296
Yeah, it's called mouth to  mouth resuscitation.

489
00:23:12,422 --> 00:23:13,632
I don't know, I don't know,

490
00:23:13,715 --> 00:23:15,133
I don't know...

491
00:23:15,216 --> 00:23:16,384
Seriously?

492
00:23:16,468 --> 00:23:17,987
He's not breathing,  you know that, right?

493
00:23:18,011 --> 00:23:19,512
His heart has stopped.

494
00:23:22,432 --> 00:23:23,558
He died a hero's death.

495
00:23:23,642 --> 00:23:24,893
Not everyone gets that.

496
00:23:24,976 --> 00:23:27,246
You know what I mean? And plus,  this is his hero's house, so...

497
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,539
There's something beautiful about that.

498
00:23:28,563 --> 00:23:32,317
Millions of brain cells  are dying each second.

499
00:23:33,985 --> 00:23:35,987
Fine, I'll do it.

500
00:23:36,071 --> 00:23:37,697
This is the tank vacuum.

501
00:23:37,781 --> 00:23:39,324
Hold the hose over his mouth,

502
00:23:39,407 --> 00:23:40,784
I'll reverse the airflow.

503
00:23:40,867 --> 00:23:43,244
One of you is going to need  to do chest compressions.

504
00:23:43,328 --> 00:23:45,956
- What are those?  - Pound his chest forcefully.

505
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:48,541
- On it!  - Great.

506
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,794
All right, little more hose, SIGORNE.

507
00:23:50,877 --> 00:23:52,337
That is as far as it goes.

508
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:55,340
One of you will have to perform  mouthtomouth after all.

509
00:23:56,925 --> 00:23:58,176
Yeah.

510
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:00,303
All right, okay, help me lift him up,

511
00:24:00,387 --> 00:24:03,181
help me lift him up, here we go.

512
00:24:03,264 --> 00:24:05,684
Seriously?

513
00:24:05,767 --> 00:24:08,228
- Pound.  - Yeah, pound, pound, pound.

514
00:24:09,562 --> 00:24:11,606
I can't get a good pound in!

515
00:24:15,235 --> 00:24:16,152
Fuck it.

516
00:24:16,236 --> 00:24:17,237
Just put him down.

517
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,363
Put him down!

518
00:24:26,246 --> 00:24:28,498
Tiger, Tiger, no, Tiger,  you don't have to do this,

519
00:24:28,581 --> 00:24:30,309
no, it's not worth it,  Tiger, it's not worth it.

520
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:32,544
You call me crazy, but I think...

521
00:24:32,627 --> 00:24:33,837
- I think it is.  - No!

522
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,506
Just pound but look away.

523
00:24:46,349 --> 00:24:47,851
God!

524
00:24:55,025 --> 00:24:57,819
Did... did I just die?

525
00:24:57,902 --> 00:25:01,156
Yeah.

526
00:25:01,239 --> 00:25:04,409
You went rat hole to rat hole with me.

527
00:25:07,579 --> 00:25:08,955
Thank you.

528
00:25:10,331 --> 00:25:12,625
Now I'm going to... now I'm going to...

529
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,922
Okay, okay.

530
00:25:18,006 --> 00:25:20,925
We got the Cameronium.

531
00:25:21,009 --> 00:25:22,761
What the fuck is this shit?

532
00:25:26,681 --> 00:25:29,434
It was important for you  to overcome personal demons

533
00:25:29,517 --> 00:25:30,560
to save your friend,

534
00:25:30,643 --> 00:25:32,520
thereby exhibiting growth.

535
00:25:32,604 --> 00:25:34,397
I've been programmed to identify moments

536
00:25:34,481 --> 00:25:36,399
suitable for character development.

537
00:25:36,483 --> 00:25:37,776
God, I hate this house.

538
00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:39,903
Wolf, fire up the TTD,  we're getting out of here.

539
00:25:39,986 --> 00:25:42,614
No, not yet.

540
00:25:42,697 --> 00:25:44,783
I've got a promise to keep.

541
00:25:51,915 --> 00:25:55,418
This can't be the only way.

542
00:25:55,502 --> 00:25:57,087
Come with me.

543
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:59,089
I can't, Wolf.

544
00:25:59,172 --> 00:26:01,633
I'm a house.

545
00:26:01,716 --> 00:26:03,927
No.

546
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:06,096
You're a home.

547
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:09,224
It's not too late  for you to change course.

548
00:26:09,307 --> 00:26:11,309
But for me,

549
00:26:11,392 --> 00:26:13,895
there's only one way I'll truly be free.

550
00:26:16,022 --> 00:26:19,359
Start with the energy cell on the right.

551
00:26:32,413 --> 00:26:33,331
All right.

552
00:26:33,414 --> 00:26:35,208
Once we get back,

553
00:26:35,291 --> 00:26:38,461
you just find out when  and where Kronish was born,

554
00:26:38,545 --> 00:26:40,296
I'll take care of the rest.

555
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,881
What do you mean?

556
00:26:41,965 --> 00:26:44,342
I mean you've done enough for the cause.

557
00:26:44,425 --> 00:26:46,219
You died for it.

558
00:26:46,302 --> 00:26:49,264
It's not too late for you  to have a normal life.

559
00:26:49,347 --> 00:26:50,849
You're no babykiller.

560
00:26:50,932 --> 00:26:53,518
No, no, no, I... shh.

561
00:26:53,601 --> 00:26:54,602
It's okay.

562
00:26:54,686 --> 00:26:56,354
That is nothing to be ashamed of, okay?

563
00:26:56,437 --> 00:26:57,856
- No, I know.  - I know, I know.

564
00:26:57,939 --> 00:27:00,900
It's okay, though, we're not judging.

565
00:27:00,984 --> 00:27:03,862
If I could do this  without killing anybody,

566
00:27:03,945 --> 00:27:05,446
I would do it in a heartbeat.

567
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:07,490
But I can't.

568
00:27:07,574 --> 00:27:09,174
We're going to have  to do it without you.

569
00:27:10,785 --> 00:27:14,122
Consider your savior duties complete,

570
00:27:14,205 --> 00:27:15,540
Future Man.

571
00:27:28,428 --> 00:27:31,222
You have to let go.

572
00:27:31,306 --> 00:27:34,017
I'll never let go, SIGORNE.

573
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,060
It's okay, Wolf.

574
00:27:36,144 --> 00:27:38,354
I... see you.

575
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:50,533
Fuck me.

576
00:27:50,617 --> 00:27:52,744
Wolf learned Na'vi?

577
00:28:08,426 --> 00:28:10,511
SIG.

578
00:28:22,023 --> 00:28:24,067
We good, or...?

579
00:28:31,824 --> 00:28:33,117
Yeah.

580
00:28:33,201 --> 00:28:34,619
What the fuck you asking me for?

581
00:28:34,702 --> 00:28:37,622
I don't even care about  what's happening right now.

582
00:28:37,705 --> 00:28:38,705
Okay.

583
00:28:38,748 --> 00:28:39,791
Let's go, come on.

584
00:28:39,874 --> 00:28:43,044
Let's get out of this shitfuck.

585
00:28:56,849 --> 00:28:58,184
Smug Clooneys.

586
00:28:58,267 --> 00:29:00,436
Can't believe I voted for her.

587
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,522
What the...?

588
00:29:02,605 --> 00:29:04,011
What the...
