1
00:00:01,203 --> 00:00:03,501
或许我不该把你一个人留在家里
Maybe l shouldn't
leave you alone

2
00:00:03,539 --> 00:00:06,030
过周末
here for the weekend.

3
00:00:06,074 --> 00:00:08,338
不，不
No, no, no.

4
00:00:08,377 --> 00:00:10,038
没关系
Come on.
The kids￡-￡-

5
00:00:10,078 --> 00:00:12,103
孩子们也得见见他们另一对爷爷奶奶
kids have to see
their other grandparents.

6
00:00:12,147 --> 00:00:14,342
总不能让他们一直以为
We can't have them
growing up thinking

7
00:00:14,383 --> 00:00:17,147
街对面的那对活宝是正常的，是不是？
what's across the street
is normal, right?

8
00:00:17,186 --> 00:00:18,779
爸爸！爸爸！
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

9
00:00:18,821 --> 00:00:21,255
爸爸！爸爸！
Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy!

10
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,190
妈妈！妈妈！
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

11
00:00:23,225 --> 00:00:24,487
妈妈！妈妈！
Mommy! Mommy!
Mommy!

12
00:00:24,527 --> 00:00:26,722
看吧？我说她会爱死这个娃娃的
See? l told you
she'd love that doll.

13
00:00:26,762 --> 00:00:28,696
是啊，多谢你了，雷
Yeah, thanks
a lot, Ray.

14
00:00:28,731 --> 00:00:30,995
去康乃迪克的一路上都会如此愉快
That's gonna be fun
all the way to Connecticut.

15
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:38,229
老兄，我真希望我能去
Man, l wish
l was going.

16
00:00:42,715 --> 00:00:44,706
我能问几个问题吗？
Can l ask you guys
something?

17
00:00:50,056 --> 00:00:52,854
你们上一次哭是什么时候？
When was the last time
you cried?

18
00:00:54,227 --> 00:00:57,219
什么意思？为了比赛？
What do you mean?
About sports?

19
00:00:59,499 --> 00:01:03,060
不，我是说真的哭
No, something real.
l mean really cried.

20
00:01:04,237 --> 00:01:07,229
不是为了比赛？
So nothing with sports?

21
00:01:07,273 --> 00:01:09,241
不是。比如上个星期，我在看
No. Like last week
l was watching

22
00:01:09,275 --> 00:01:10,708
《亲爱的，我把孩子缩小了》
"Honey, l Shrunk
the Kids."

23
00:01:10,743 --> 00:01:13,371
那个人拼命寻找被他缩小了的孩子
The guy was looking
for his shrunken kids

24
00:01:13,413 --> 00:01:16,473
然后我就哭了
因为我觉得
and l cried
'cause l didn't think

25
00:01:16,516 --> 00:01:19,246
我的爸爸不会像那样
去找我的
my father would come
looking for me.

26
00:01:21,921 --> 00:01:23,912
要找到你并不难
lt wouldn't be hard
to find you.

27
00:01:26,826 --> 00:01:28,953
没错，只要跟着
Yeah, you just look
under the cookie

28
00:01:28,995 --> 00:01:31,156
在地板上移动的饼干就行了
that's moving
across the floor.

29
00:01:32,165 --> 00:01:34,690
不，不
No, no, no.

30
00:01:34,734 --> 00:01:38,761
不，伙计们。我能理解他说的感受
No, guys. l know what he's talking
about with the crying thing.

31
00:01:38,805 --> 00:01:42,468
有一天，我送双胞胎去学前班
The other day, l dropped
my twins off at pre￡-school...

32
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,744
我看着他们走进去……
and l was watching
them go in, you know?

33
00:01:46,779 --> 00:01:48,747
门就那么关上了
And just as the door
was closing,

34
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:52,410
我看见麦克拉着杰弗瑞的手……
l saw Michael take
Geoffrey's hand...

35
00:01:52,452 --> 00:01:55,250
然后……
and...

36
00:01:55,288 --> 00:01:57,882
我不知道
l don't know.

37
00:01:57,924 --> 00:02:00,324
在你们嚎啕大哭前我最好还是先回家了
l'm going home before
you guys start making out.

38
00:02:01,961 --> 00:02:04,191
是啊，我该走了
已经很晚了
Yeah, l gotta go.
lt's getting late. l gotta go.

39
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,198
－哇！等等，等等
－嘿，吉昂尼！
￡- Whoa! Wait, wait!
￡- Hey, Gianni.

40
00:02:06,232 --> 00:02:08,029
上车后我告诉你我哭的故事
l'll tell you my cry
story in the car.

41
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:10,194
好极了！我肯定会吐的
Great! That'll be
my throw￡-up story.

42
00:02:10,236 --> 00:02:11,931
哇！你们都在说什么呢？
Whoa! What are you
talking about?

43
00:02:11,971 --> 00:02:13,905
我们才刚开始呢
We're just getting
started here.

44
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,307
－雷，我们在这里呆了4个钟头了
－还不到11点呢
￡- Ray, we've been here like four hours.
￡- lt's not even 1 1 :00.

45
00:02:17,343 --> 00:02:19,607
我早上6点就起来了，累坏了
l've been up since 6:00 A.M.
l'm tired.

46
00:02:19,646 --> 00:02:21,614
不会吧？这样就受不了了？嗯？
Come on.
What, you can't take it, huh?

47
00:02:21,648 --> 00:02:23,411
你们这些没用的家伙！
还是不是男人啊？
You're wimps.
What, you're not men?

48
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:25,644
雷，刚才是你说你哭了
Ray, you're the one that
just told us you cry

49
00:02:25,685 --> 00:02:29,121
就因为你的双胞胎是同性恋
because you think
your twins are gay.

50
00:02:29,155 --> 00:02:31,623
故事的重点不是这个！
That wasn't the point
of the story!

51
00:02:31,658 --> 00:02:33,626
我不想知道故事的重点
l don't want to know
the point of the story.

52
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,460
来吧，这是我难得的自由之夜
伙计们！道格！
Come on, it's my one night
of freedom here, guys! Doug!

53
00:02:37,497 --> 00:02:39,488
噢，别这样！
Oh, come on!

54
00:02:41,868 --> 00:02:44,302
我该走了，明天我还得早起呢
l probably should get going.
l have to get up early.

55
00:02:44,337 --> 00:02:46,328
噢，已经很晚了吗？
Oh, is it getting late?

56
00:02:49,676 --> 00:02:51,667
或许还不算晚
Maybe not.

57
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,487
搞什么鬼啊？
What the hell
is that?

58
00:03:01,521 --> 00:03:04,513
现在已经12点半了！
也没那么晚啦
lt's 1 2:30.
Not that that's late.

59
00:03:08,695 --> 00:03:10,890
－嘿
－嘿，怎么回事？你想干什么？
￡- Hey.
￡- Hey, what? What do you want?

60
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,558
孩子不在，黛博拉也不在
来吧，我们玩点什么？
No kids, no Debra.
Come on, what are we doing?

61
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,158
什么都不玩。
谢谢你过来看我
Nothing.
Thanks for stopping by.

62
00:03:15,201 --> 00:03:18,193
来啊，来啊
伙计，今晚我是自由人
Come on!
Come on, man! l'm free here.

63
00:03:19,706 --> 00:03:20,764
噢
Oh.

64
00:03:21,874 --> 00:03:23,705
－嗨
－哈喽
￡- Hi.
￡- Hello.

65
00:03:29,048 --> 00:03:31,016
我是艾琳
l'm Aileen.

66
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,678
我是雷，罗伯特的弟弟
l'm Ray.
Robert's brother.

67
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,348
呃，OK，我很抱歉
Yeah, uh,
okay, sorry.

68
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:38,289
你们两个请便
Look, you guys
get back to, uh,

69
00:03:38,324 --> 00:03:40,349
继续你们刚才在沙发上做的事
whatever it was you
were doing on the couch.

70
00:03:40,393 --> 00:03:42,190
还有，呃……
And, uh...

71
00:03:42,228 --> 00:03:45,026
我们明天再谈
不是关于你们今晚做的事
we'll talk tomorrow.
Not about what you did.

72
00:03:48,901 --> 00:03:50,892
马上走
Go now.

73
00:03:52,905 --> 00:03:54,873
事实上，罗伯特
我最好还是回去了
Actually, Robert,
l'd better get going.

74
00:03:54,907 --> 00:03:56,875
－不，不，留下
－是啊，留下
￡- No, no, stay.
￡- Yeah, stay.

￡- No.
￡- Please, please, stay.

76
00:03:58,911 --> 00:04:00,708
太晚了，很高兴认识你，雷
lt's late.
Nice to meet you, Ray.

77
00:04:00,747 --> 00:04:03,545
－我再打电话给你
－谁？我？噢，是他
￡- l'll call you.
￡- Who me? Oh him! Yeah, him.

78
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:06,575
是啊，打给他
一定要打给他
Yeah, call him.
Yeah, please call him.

79
00:04:24,737 --> 00:04:26,728
噢～～！
Whoops.

80
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:31,176
－你见鬼地到这里来干什么？
－什么？
￡- What the hell is wrong with you?
￡- What?

81
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,178
我只想出来放松一下
l just wanted
to hang out.

82
00:04:33,212 --> 00:04:35,908
我没想到误撞了“美女与野兽”
l didn't know l'd be walking in
on Beauty and the Beast.

83
00:04:38,618 --> 00:04:41,212
我们什么时候有半夜出去放松的习惯了？
Since when do we
hang out at midnight?

84
00:04:41,254 --> 00:04:43,347
怎么了？我现在还不想睡
What? l didn't want
to go to bed yet! Huh?

85
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:45,687
我何必一个人呆在空空的房子里
Come on, why should l
stay up in an empty house

86
00:04:45,725 --> 00:04:47,818
我可以整晚做我想做的事
all night when l can
do whatever l want!

87
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,328
你简直不可理喻
You know,
you are unbelievable!

88
00:04:50,363 --> 00:04:52,331
我准备不可理喻地放纵了
l'm unbelievably
ready to roll.

89
00:04:52,365 --> 00:04:55,391
这就是我
哈哈嘿嘿
That's what l am.
Ha, ha, he, he!

90
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:01,162
－等一下，你说空房子？
－没错，我自由了
￡- Wait a minute, empty house?
￡- That's right, l'm free!

91
00:05:01,207 --> 00:05:04,108
－黛博拉和孩子们不在家？
－没错
￡- Debra and the kids are away?
￡- Uh￡-huh.

92
00:05:04,143 --> 00:05:07,044

怎么？
What?

98
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,355
你害怕一个人过夜
You're afraid to spend
the night alone.

99
00:05:29,335 --> 00:05:31,496
你怎么从“泡沫涂满我的屁股”
里得出这个结论的？
How do you get that
from bubbles in my heinir?

100
00:05:34,006 --> 00:05:35,974
雷，知你莫如我
Ray, it's me
you're talking to.

101
00:05:36,008 --> 00:05:37,976
我们可是一起长大的
We use to share
a bedroom.

102
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,637
你害怕了
You get scared.

103
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:42,147
什么？你胡说八道
我才没有
What? You don't know what
you're talking about. l do not.

104
00:05:42,181 --> 00:05:43,614
是吗？还记得一到晚上
Yeah? Remember how long
you had to keep

105
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:45,879
你就要把小夜灯开着不肯关
胆小鬼？
the Popeye nightlight,
scardey￡-pooh?

106
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,111
是啊，只要大力水手不来
Yeah, well, until Popeye
came along

107
00:05:49,155 --> 00:05:51,020
你就不敢关走廊里的灯
you had to keep
the hallway light on.

108
00:05:51,057 --> 00:05:52,922
只有爸爸讲了恐怖故事后才会这样
Only after one
of Dad's bedtime stories.

109
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,950
每天都如此
Which was every night.

110
00:05:54,994 --> 00:05:58,361
听着，如果你晚上不敢睡觉
就打开电视机
Listen, if you're having trouble
sleeping just turn on the Tv.

111
00:05:58,397 --> 00:06:00,729
我没有不敢睡觉
l'm not having
trouble sleeping.

112
00:06:00,767 --> 00:06:03,327
我很好，OK？
我一点也不害怕，罗伯特
l'm fine, okay?
l'm not scared, Robert.

113
00:06:03,369 --> 00:06:05,837
是啊
Yeah.

114
00:06:05,872 --> 00:06:07,931
听你大哥的话
Listen to your
big brother.

115
00:06:07,974 --> 00:06:10,169
OK？看看电视
Okay?
Watch some Tv.

116
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:12,541
探索频道，小家伙
Discovery Channel,
cubby.

117
00:06:12,578 --> 00:06:15,376
大自然会让你平静下来的
Nature will put
you right out.

118
00:06:15,414 --> 00:06:18,212
是啊是啊，除非是关于猴子的，是吧？
Yeah, yeah.
Unless it's about monkeys, right?

119
00:06:20,553 --> 00:06:23,317
你那是什么意思？
What's that suppose
to mean?

120
00:06:23,356 --> 00:06:25,347
没什么
Nothing.
l just, uh￡-￡-

121
00:06:25,391 --> 00:06:27,518
我想起了那个鞋撑
l remember
a particular shoetree

122
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,994
放在你的壁橱里，有个影子……
in your closet
that had a shadow...

123
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:32,520
－够了！
－你总觉得是……
￡- All right!
￡- ...that you thought

124
00:06:32,565 --> 00:06:34,294
一只举着斧头的猴子
looked like a monkey
holding an axe.

125
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,528
嘿，听着，我那时才10岁
Hey, listen,
l was 10 years old

126
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:39,834
而且我的鞋撑很大
and my shoetrees
were big.

127
00:06:39,872 --> 00:06:42,568
－尖尖的嘴巴，还有斧子！
－好了，我现在已经不怕了
￡- Pointy holes and an axe.
￡- Yeah, l'm over it now!

128
00:06:42,608 --> 00:06:44,838
是吗？你的壁橱里有没有鞋撑？
Oh, yeah?
Got any shoetrees in your closet?

129
00:06:44,877 --> 00:06:47,539
这不关你的事
你该走了
lt's none of your business
and it's time for you to go.

130
00:06:48,948 --> 00:06:51,075
行了，快滚吧
All right, get outta here!

131
00:06:51,117 --> 00:06:53,847
－这里一点也不好玩
－没错，还有……
￡- This place is stupid.
￡- Yeah. Oh, and, uh,

132
00:06:53,886 --> 00:06:57,219
祝你独自呆在那座又大又黑的房子里
好运
good luck in that big, dark house
you're gonna be all alone in.

133
00:06:57,256 --> 00:06:59,747
也许并不是独自一人？
Or are you?

134
00:07:20,498 --> 00:07:22,489
肯定有什么东西在
All right,
that was something.

135
00:07:34,578 --> 00:07:36,705
谁在那儿？
Who is it there?

136
00:07:57,868 --> 00:07:59,859
这样我就听不见凶手了
Now l can't hear
the murderer.

137
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:16,853
“母亲准备找一处阴凉的树荫”
The mother decides
to nurse its young

138
00:08:16,887 --> 00:08:19,355
“来照顾她的孩子”
under the cooling shade
of a nearby tree.

139
00:08:22,226 --> 00:08:25,855
“不幸的是，这个决定将使得小羚羊丧命”
Unfortunately, that decision
will cost the gazelle its life.

140
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:28,023
“一头狮子捉住了她的……”
The lion will catch her...

141
00:08:28,065 --> 00:08:30,226
不，不！
No, no, no!!

142
00:08:32,903 --> 00:08:34,871
多谢了，罗伯特
Thanks, Robert!

143
00:08:34,905 --> 00:08:36,896
愚蠢的大自然
Stupid nature.

144
00:09:07,271 --> 00:09:09,262
该死的娃娃！
Friggin' doll!

145
00:09:14,948 --> 00:09:16,813
嘿
Hey.

你怎么起来了？
Oh, Raymond.
What are you doing up?

147
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:21,444
睡不着吗？亲爱的
Can't you sleep, dear?

148
00:09:21,487 --> 00:09:23,955
不是，我想睡就可以睡
No, no.
No, l could sleep if l wanted to.

00:09:32,665 --> 00:09:34,633
你怎么也没睡？
So, what are you doing
still awake?

154
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:36,225
我帮罗伯特煮点茶
l'm making tea
for Robert.

155
00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:38,260
－罗伯特？
－是啊
￡- Robert?
￡- Yeah.

156

他们要把他的公寓消毒
They fumigated
his apartment today

157
00:09:45,745 --> 00:09:47,542
他直到明天才能回家
and he can't go back home
until tomorrow.

158
00:09:48,748 --> 00:09:51,911
－噢，真的吗？
－是的
￡- Oh, really?
￡- Yes.

159

他说那是军蚁
He said they had
army ants.

160
00:09:54,854 --> 00:09:57,846
军蚁
Army ants.

161
00:10:01,527 --> 00:10:03,927
你来这儿干什么？
Well, what are you

162
00:10:03,963 --> 00:10:05,988
嘿，我只是顺道走过来看看
Hey, l just had to walk

你可得开车来这儿，巴龙警官
You had to drive here,
Officer Barone.

164
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:13,899

￡- What are you talking about?
￡- Ray's scared.

165
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,465

￡- Hey, you're the one who's scared!
￡- What do you mean?

166

你病了？有麻烦了？
You sick?
You in trouble?

167
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:19,973
谁恐吓你了？
Someone bullying you?

168
00:10:22,715 --> 00:10:26,014
－不是，妈妈
－那是什么？你怕什么？
￡- No, Ma.
￡- Then what? What are you scared of?

169
00:10:29,322 --> 00:10:31,620
孤单
Being alone.

170
00:10:31,658 --> 00:10:35,025
你指你的下半辈子？
You mean for the rest
of your life?

171
00:10:39,165 --> 00:10:42,464
不，不过谢谢你提出这种可能性
No, but thanks for bringing up
that possibility.

172
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,138
－那是为什么？
－我不知道，妈
￡- Then what is it?
￡- l don't know, Ma.

173
00:10:46,172 --> 00:10:48,470
你知道的，奇怪的声音
You know, noises.

174
00:10:48,508 --> 00:10:50,976
狗，壁橱里的东西……
The dog.
Things in the closet. lt just￡-￡-

175
00:10:51,011 --> 00:10:53,605
有时候会让我睡不着觉
雷蒙德也是这样的
sometimes it creeps me out,
you know? Raymond too!

176
00:10:53,647 --> 00:10:56,138
嘿，嘿
说你自己就行了
Hey, hey, hey.

嘿，今晚是你先到我那里去的
Hey, you're the one who came
over to my place tonight.

178
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:01,479
是啊，哪有什么军蚁
Yes, and there were
no army ants.

179
00:11:01,521 --> 00:11:03,819
噢，我的房子空荡荡的
Oh, my house is empty.

180
00:11:03,857 --> 00:11:05,825
黛博拉走了
Debra's gone!

181
00:11:05,859 --> 00:11:07,588
噢，不
我吓坏了
Oh, no!

182
00:11:07,627 --> 00:11:09,458
闭嘴，超级蠢驴
Shut up,

你闭嘴！顶级笨牛！
You shut up, schmuck
of the whole neighborhood!

－我知道没你厉害
￡- That's smaller, you idiot!
￡- l know it's smaller!

185
00:11:14,434 --> 00:11:16,493
别吵了！ 别吵了！
Stop, stop, stop!

186
00:11:16,536 --> 00:11:18,470
停下！

187
00:11:18,505 --> 00:11:20,769
雷蒙德，你哥哥可不是一只猴子
Raymond, your brother
is not a monkey.

188
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:31,527
有时候感到害怕是很自然的事情
There's nothing wrong
with being a little frightened.

189
00:11:31,568 --> 00:11:33,695
－我们都有害怕的时候，不是吗？
－是啊
￡- We all get scared sometimes, right?
￡- Yeah.

190
00:11:33,737 --> 00:11:35,864
你们可以……
And you can￡-￡-
there's no reason why you can't

191
00:11:35,906 --> 00:11:39,103
你们可以随时随刻到这里来
没有关系
come over here every once
in a while. That's fine.

192
00:11:39,143 --> 00:11:41,771
在你们感到害怕的时候，
有一个避风的港湾可以让你们依靠
Doesn't it make you feel good
that there's a place to go

193
00:11:41,812 --> 00:11:45,077
感觉是不是很好？
罗比？
if you're feeling
scared, Robbie?

194
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,880
是啊，我想是的
Yeah, l guess.

195
00:11:47,918 --> 00:11:49,510
雷蒙德？
Raymond?

196
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:07,160
哈喽，姑娘们
Hello, ladies.

－王八蛋！
￡- Frank!
￡- Jerk!

198
00:12:10,408 --> 00:12:13,434
你干嘛要这样？他们已经吓坏了
Why do you do that?
They're scared already.

199
00:12:13,478 --> 00:12:16,276
正因为如此我才吓他们
That's why
l did it.

200
00:12:16,314 --> 00:12:19,477
你们都是成年人了，上帝啊
你们到底是怎么回事？
You're grown men, for God's sake.
What's wrong with you?

201
00:12:19,517 --> 00:12:22,077
嘿，你才是罪魁祸首
Hey, you're the one who
started the whole thing.

202
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,315
这话是什么意思？
Well, what the hell's
that suppose to mean?

203
00:12:24,355 --> 00:12:27,256
你不记得了吗？
我们壁橱里的奇怪雕像？
Oh, you don't remember the stories?
Gargoyles in our closet?

204
00:12:27,292 --> 00:12:30,284
还有那个哥哥
总是想等我睡着了以后
Or a big brother who's just waiting
for me to fall asleep

205
00:12:30,328 --> 00:12:32,956
来偷我的脑子？
so he can steal
my brain?

206
00:12:32,997 --> 00:12:35,795
还有那个蜘蛛人弟弟？
Or a little brother
who's half￡-spider?

207
00:12:36,968 --> 00:12:38,993
蜘蛛人
Half￡-spider.

208
00:12:39,037 --> 00:12:41,028
是啊，有趣极了，爸爸
Yeah, very funny, Dad.

209
00:12:42,173 --> 00:12:43,435
你们省省吧！
Give me a break!

210
00:12:43,474 --> 00:12:45,442
你们自己要我讲的
You asked for them.

211
00:12:45,476 --> 00:12:47,444
“吓吓我们吧，爸爸”
"Scare us, Daddy.

212
00:12:47,478 --> 00:12:49,776
“给我们讲一个恐怖故事”
Tell us a scary story."

213
00:12:49,814 --> 00:12:52,977
我们还要求开车来着
We also asked
to drive the car.

214
00:12:53,017 --> 00:12:55,144
知道吗？你应该明白
You know?
l mean, you should know better.

215
00:12:55,186 --> 00:12:57,484
你把我们吓坏了，我们都不敢睡觉
You scared the hell out of us.
We couldn't sleep.

216
00:12:57,522 --> 00:13:00,650
是啊，很多次甚至还尿床了
Yeah, couple of times
we even wet our beds.

217
00:13:00,692 --> 00:13:02,250
我可没尿过床
l never did that.

218
00:13:05,863 --> 00:13:07,524
噢，弗兰克
Oh, Frank!

219
00:13:07,565 --> 00:13:09,328
看看你对他们做了什么
Look what you did
to them!

220
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:11,335
别跟我来这套，玛丽
Don't give me that,
Marie!

221
00:13:11,369 --> 00:13:13,337
你喜欢我吓他们
You loved it
when l scared them!

222
00:13:13,371 --> 00:13:15,134
那样他们都会跑到你那儿
Then they'd come
running to you

223
00:13:15,173 --> 00:13:18,939
你可以对他们又抱又亲又舔的
and you could hug and cuddle
and slobber all over them.

224
00:13:18,977 --> 00:13:21,844
嘿，那感觉很不错
这可是我一个美好记忆
Hey, that was nice.
That's an actual good memory l have.

225

－是的
￡- She'd calm us down.
￡- Yeah.

226

她总是挠我的头
She use to scratch
my head.

227
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,077
那很管用
That helped.

228
00:13:27,118 --> 00:13:29,382
我不想看见我的孩子们被吓着
l didn't like seeing
my boys scared.

229
00:13:32,557 --> 00:13:35,321
－还记得黄油饼干吗？
－是啊，你还有吗？妈
￡- Remember butter cookies?
￡- Oh yeah, you got any of those, Ma?

230
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,918

我这就去拿
Oh, sure, honey.
Let me get them.

231
00:13:36,961 --> 00:13:39,395
我要法式脆饼

232
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:42,399
还记得我们一起上楼躲开他
Remember that we'd go upstairs
to our room to get away from him?

233
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:44,765
然后谈论麦滋队，一直到我们睡着
Then we'd talk about
the Mets till we feel asleep.

234
00:13:44,802 --> 00:13:47,794
－是啊
－我很高兴有你在，小家伙
￡- Yeah.

可爱的爱尔兰小妖精

我都会搭上一群小妖精来吓你们
l'd throw in a couple of leprechauns
to scare the bejesus outta you.

243
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,725
嘿，雷？
Hey, Ray?

244
00:14:13,765 --> 00:14:17,428
我怎么会知道小雷蒙德害怕妖精的呢？
How did l know little Raymond

245

你说呢？罗伯特
Any ideas, Robert?

247
00:14:22,607 --> 00:14:24,734
哦，爸爸，别把矛头指向我
Oh, Dad, don't start

￡- That's not gonna work. Right, Ray?
￡- That's right.

他怎么会知道妖精的？
How did he know

我什么也不知道

All l know is l couldn't serve you

￡- You told him!
￡- Oh, all right.

255
00:14:50,301 --> 00:14:51,928
是我说的
Yes, l did.
l told him.

256
00:14:51,969 --> 00:14:54,597
－罗伯特！
－你为什么要那么做？
￡- Robert!
￡- Why would you do that?

257
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,972
我想要听他讲恐怖故事
但又不想被吓着
l liked when he told us the stories
but l didn't want to get scared.

258
00:14:58,009 --> 00:15:01,069
我不怕妖精
And l had no problem
with leprechauns.

259
00:15:01,112 --> 00:15:03,103
噢，好啊！
你可以呼呼大睡
Oh, great!
So you could sleep and l could

260
00:15:03,147 --> 00:15:05,615
而我却整晚不敢睡
等着那些小怪物
stay up all night waiting
for those little monsters

261
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,016
－来把我掳到他们的巢里去
－巢？
￡- to come and take me to their nest.
￡- Nest?

262
00:15:08,052 --> 00:15:10,350
－没错，巢！
－我很抱歉，OK？
￡- That's right, nest!
￡- Listen, l'm sorry, okay?

263
00:15:10,388 --> 00:15:12,288
我一直很自责
Don't think l didn't
hate myself for it.

264
00:15:12,323 --> 00:15:15,724
别忘了，那段时间我总以为你是蜘蛛人
Don't forget. At that time l thought
you might be half￡-spider.

265
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:22,031
我给爸爸通风报信的那段时间
You know in those days when l was
running information to Dad,

266
00:15:23,701 --> 00:15:27,501
我以为我尿床是因为太内疚了
l think the guilt was the cause
of my occasional bedwetting.

267
00:15:27,538 --> 00:15:30,530
好吧，不管怎样，那都是过去的事了
All right, look, whatever.
lt was a long time ago.

268
00:15:30,575 --> 00:15:33,635
是啊，但这是不对的
我们应该团结一致的，是不是？
Yeah, but it was wrong. We were
suppose to stick together, right?

269
00:15:33,678 --> 00:15:37,045
－我是说，我们是亲兄弟
－兄弟才会这样吵吵闹闹的
￡- l mean, we're brothers.
￡- Brothers do those kind of things.

270
00:15:37,081 --> 00:15:39,049
那不是好兄弟
Not good ones.

271
00:15:42,186 --> 00:15:44,916
好吧，听着
有些事我得告诉你
All right, listen!
l gotta tell you something!

272
00:15:44,956 --> 00:15:47,117
你从没尿过床
You never wet your bed.

273
00:15:48,526 --> 00:15:50,653
我曾经……
l use to￡-￡-

274
00:15:50,695 --> 00:15:52,993
等你睡着以后
l use to wait
until you fell asleep

275
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:55,430
把一杯水倒在你的床上
and then l'd pour a glass
of water in there with you.

276
00:15:58,369 --> 00:16:00,337
－什么？
－什么？
￡- What?!
￡- What?!

277
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,170
我……
Well l￡-￡-

278
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:07,507
我不想自己看起来像个小孩
你知道吗？
l didn't want to always
look like a baby, you know?

279
00:16:07,545 --> 00:16:09,513
一害怕就叫妈妈
Calling for Mom
when l was scared.

280
00:16:09,547 --> 00:16:12,107
我知道如果你尿床了，她就会过来
l knew that she would come
if you wet your bed.

281
00:16:13,718 --> 00:16:17,745
我总是弄不明白
为什么醒来就在你的身边
l always wondered why
l was up by your shoulders.

282
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:26,921
对不起，老兄
我只是……
l'm sorry, man.
l'm just￡-￡-

283
00:16:26,964 --> 00:16:30,422
对不起！我那时才6岁
还很不懂事
Sorry! Look, l was six!
l was under a lot of pressure.

284
00:16:30,468 --> 00:16:33,198
噢，你那么做，雷蒙德
Oh, you just did that,
Raymond,

285
00:16:33,237 --> 00:16:36,638
只是希望和你妈妈亲近一点
'cause you wanted
to be near your mommy.

286
00:16:36,674 --> 00:16:39,768
怎么样？当头一棒吧？
Well ain't this
a kick in the ass?

287
00:16:42,413 --> 00:16:45,041
每个人都迫不及待地责备我
Everyone was so quick
to blame me for all of this,

288
00:16:45,082 --> 00:16:47,050
但是看看你们自己吧
but look at you.

289
00:16:47,084 --> 00:16:49,109
你们的手上都沾满了鲜血
You've all got blood
on your hands.

290
00:16:50,922 --> 00:16:52,890
现在我要去睡觉了
Now l'm going back to bed

291
00:16:52,924 --> 00:16:55,757
我要去继续睡觉了
and l'm gonna sleep
the sleep of the just.

292
00:16:58,729 --> 00:17:01,357
好吧，我也回去了
All right, l'm going home.
l'm going home.

293
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:03,560
这场驱魔仪式把我累坏了
This little exorcism
wore me out.

294
00:17:03,601 --> 00:17:06,035
罗伯特，来吧
你可以睡沙发
Robert, come on.
You can sleep on my couch.

295
00:17:07,104 --> 00:17:09,038
晚安，姑娘们
Good night, girls!

￡- Come on, let's go.
￡- Good night, boys.

297
00:17:11,075 --> 00:17:13,043
盖好辈子，别让臭虫咬了
Sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

298
00:17:13,077 --> 00:17:16,410
臭虫没什么可怕的，你们很安全
Not that there are bedbugs.
You're perfectly safe.

299
00:17:16,447 --> 00:17:18,677
－别忘了把门锁好
－知道了，妈
￡- But make sure you lock your door.
￡- Got it, Ma!

300
00:17:18,716 --> 00:17:21,241

￡- Hey, come on.
￡- What are you doing?

302
00:17:23,454 --> 00:17:25,922
妈妈在沏茶
Mom's making
herself tea.

303
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:27,948
我们可以去吓爸爸
来啊，我们走
We can get Dad.

￡- Little payback time.
￡- Yeah.

307
00:17:47,645 --> 00:17:50,944
－我们该怎么做？
－跳出去尖叫
￡- So how should we do it?
￡- We'll just jump out and scream.

308
00:17:50,982 --> 00:17:52,950
好啊，就叫“我们来抓你了！！”
Yeah, like,
"We're gonna get you!"

Or, "We need blood!"

或许我们吓得他越多
Maybe the more
we do it to him,

318
