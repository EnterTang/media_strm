
1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Well, just get your lawyer to keep me up-to-date.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Mm-hm.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I’m away for the weekend.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And you want me here?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
T o keep an eye on the place, yes. Just stay away from the bar.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But I’ll have my mobile on me if you need anything.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I’ve asked them all to watch me.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You'll be alright.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What did she say?

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
She said if I get charged, we'll worry about it then but...

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
...there's no reason to jump the gun.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh, good!

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Otherwise, we'd all have to go on strike.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
OK, who's for a drink?

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
My little family?

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
-Um, let's not drink. -Oh, bullshit.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Come on -you're not going into a convent or anything.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You're gonna be here with us, in the real world.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Mmm.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Nat!

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So we're off, then.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
lntroduction?

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
T his is Bernie. T he girls.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
-And you know Sean. -Hi, Bernie.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I don't think I’ll be here when you get back, Nat, so goodbye.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Goodbye.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Anybody else leaving that I should know about?

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Well, we might need a few extra girls just in case -

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,000
maybe a dominatrix.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
-Anyone in mind? -Possibly.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Hey, Bernie?

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Um... good luck.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
-Right. -Let's go, then.
