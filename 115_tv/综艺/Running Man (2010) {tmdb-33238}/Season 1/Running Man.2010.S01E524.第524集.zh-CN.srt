1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,345
别这样。星期六。
他们在楼下看动画片
come on. It's Saturday.
They're downstairs watching cartoons.

2
00:00:06,386 --> 00:00:10,223
- 他们要是上来怎么办？
- 不不，他们正看得欢呢
- But what if they come up.
- No no, they're in the zone, okay?

3
00:00:10,223 --> 00:00:13,185
只要有电咱们就是安全的
We're safe as Iong
as there's eIectricity.

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,692
什么，就这样了？
完事了？
What, is that it?
Are we done?

5
00:00:20,734 --> 00:00:22,694
有东西撞墙了
Something hit the waII.

6
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,954
- 天，你把我便便都吓出来了！
- 搞什么――
- Jeez, you scared the crap out of me!
- What the--

7
00:00:32,996 --> 00:00:34,581
你搞什么呢？！
what the heII
are you doing?!

8
00:00:34,623 --> 00:00:37,709
我在给你刷墙呢。
你看像什么？
I'm painting your house.
What's it Iook Iike?

9
00:00:37,751 --> 00:00:40,504
看着像……我们安了
世上最丑的百叶窗
Looks Iike... we have the worId's
ugIiest shutters.

10
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,843
听着
Listen.

11
00:00:46,885 --> 00:00:50,347
弗兰克，我们打算雇人刷的
Frank, we were going
to hire painters to do that.

12
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:52,641
那么，你可以待会再谢我
So, you can
thank me Iater.

13
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:54,685
我喜欢好吃的巧克力
I Iike fine chocoIates.

14
00:00:54,726 --> 00:00:56,645
爸，求你了，
快下来，好吗？
Dad, pIease,
get down from there, okay?

15
00:00:56,687 --> 00:00:59,272
我们在――我们想――
睡觉呢
We're-- we're trying to...
sIeep here.

16
00:00:59,314 --> 00:01:02,192
哦，当然，是的。
逮到你们了
Oh, sure, yeah.
I got you.

17
00:01:02,234 --> 00:01:06,113
星期六的小睡后清醒剂？
A IittIe Saturday morning
wake me up?

18
00:01:06,154 --> 00:01:08,490
关上窗户，我不会听的
Just cIose the window.
I won't Iisten.

19
00:01:13,036 --> 00:01:15,789
你知道，我担心的不是听
You know, I'm not worried
about the Iistening.

20
00:01:15,831 --> 00:01:17,499
而是窃听
It's the heckIing.

21
00:01:22,157 --> 00:01:24,242
妈，爸怎么
在刷我们的房子？
Ma, why is Dad
painting the house?

22
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,202
哦，这是我给你的礼物
Oh, that's my gift to you.

23
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:29,706
什么？！
What?!

24
00:01:29,748 --> 00:01:32,250
你们总说起要刷房子……
You two aIways taIk
about having your house painted...

25
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,711
所以，我把这活交给你爸了
so, I put your father
on the job.

26
00:01:34,753 --> 00:01:38,256
可是，玛丽，
我们打算雇专业人员的
But, Marie, we were going
to hire professionaIs.

27
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:39,799
哦，可是弗兰克做得很好
Oh, but Frank
is very good.

28
00:01:39,841 --> 00:01:41,718
我们的房子上
他就做得很好
He did a nice job
on our house...

29
00:01:41,718 --> 00:01:44,137
并且他喜欢漆味
and he Iikes the fumes.

30
00:01:46,264 --> 00:01:49,351
唔，是的，你们的房子
他是刷得不错，并且……
WeII, yes, he did do a nice job
on your house and...

31
00:01:49,392 --> 00:01:51,936
我也讨厌给人泼冷水，
可是――
I wouId hate to kiII
anyone's buzz, but--

32
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:53,855
是的，可我们在想，
Yeah, but we were kind of thinking

33
00:01:53,897 --> 00:01:56,524
这种事应该我们做主，
that we wouId be the ones
to make that decision,

34
00:01:56,566 --> 00:01:58,985
因为这也算是我们的房子
'cause it is
kind of our house.

35
00:02:00,195 --> 00:02:02,572
是，可我们才是得看着它的
Yes, but we're the ones
who have to Iook at it.

36
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:07,202
好吧，我拿法国吐司
骗他下来
AII right, I'm going to use this
french toast to Iure him off the Iadder.

37
00:02:07,243 --> 00:02:09,954
好吧好吧好吧。
就让你爸做吧
Okay okay okay.
Just Iet your father do this.

38
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:11,873
我需要他离开我的房子
I need him
out of my house.

39
00:02:11,915 --> 00:02:16,086
自从他退休，
他老是在我眼前晃
Ever since he's retired,
he's around aII the time.

40
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:18,088
是啊，可退了休
就是这样
Yeah, but that's what happens
when you retire.

41
00:02:18,088 --> 00:02:20,715
我知道，我只是没想到
他会活这么长
I know, but I never thought
he'd Iive this Iong.

42
00:02:23,718 --> 00:02:25,220
行了，妈，看
Come on, Ma, Iook.

43
00:02:25,261 --> 00:02:27,180
那不是我们的错，好吗？
That's not our probIem,
aII right?

44
00:02:27,222 --> 00:02:29,265
你有40年时间下毒
You've had 40 years
to poison him.

45
00:02:29,307 --> 00:02:32,727
好吧。好吧。
雷蒙德，求你了……
Okay. Fine.
Raymond, pIease...

46
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:35,355
我需要空间。
我需要自己的时间
I need space.
I need a IittIe time to myseIf.

47
00:02:35,397 --> 00:02:37,899
我想做事的时候
不希望看到他
I don't want him around
when I'm trying to do things.

48
00:02:37,941 --> 00:02:41,695
- 做什么事？
- 当我想要提升自己的时候
- Do what things?
- When I'm trying to improve myseIf.

49
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,156
这可不是一日之功
This doesn't just happen.

50
00:02:47,993 --> 00:02:50,245
我练习外语、唱歌剧，
I practice my Ianguages,
I have my opera,

51
00:02:50,286 --> 00:02:52,330
最近我又开始练瑜伽了
and I'm starting yoga.

52
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:55,542
你――
You--

53
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,629
怎么了？
这很奇怪吗？
What?
Is that so strange?

54
00:02:59,671 --> 00:03:03,341
- 是的
- 嘿
- Yes.
- Hey.

55
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,343
- 你做什么？
- 刷你的房子
- What are you doing?
- Painting your house.

56
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,762
哦，拜托！
你也来？
Oh, come on!
You too?

57
00:03:07,804 --> 00:03:09,556
妈说我们要的
Ma said we had to.

58
00:03:09,597 --> 00:03:11,224
那么，妈说什么你都做了？
So, you do everything
Ma teIIs you?

59
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:14,144
现在叛逆可有点迟了，雷蒙德
It's a IittIe Iate
for rebeIIion, Raymond.

60
00:03:14,185 --> 00:03:16,938
行了，看。
我不需要你们俩
Come on, Iook.
I don't need both you guys

61
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,565
吊死在我房子上，好吗？
hanging off my house, okay?

62
00:03:18,606 --> 00:03:21,860
所以回你的卡车，
摇个铃，卖雪糕去吧
So go back in your truck,
ring a beII and seII some fudge pops.

63
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:29,159
好的，等等。
等等等等等一下，雷
AII right, wait.
Wait wait wait wait a minute, Ray.

64
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,287
你知道，你们来帮忙
真是太热心了
You know, that was
very sweet of you to heIp.

65
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:34,080
非常感谢，罗伯特
Thanks a Iot, Robert.

66
00:03:34,122 --> 00:03:36,082
- 什――现在你又想他干了？
- 唔，我的意思是，
- Wha-- now you want him to?
- WeII, I mean,

67
00:03:36,124 --> 00:03:40,128
罗伯特愿意来，你爸已经
上手刮旧漆了，所以我说好吧
Robert's offered, your dad's
aIready started scraping, so I say fine.

68
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,172
- 唔，行了，你不想他们――
- 嘿嘿嘿，
- WeII, come on, you don't want them--
- Hey hey hey,

69
00:03:42,213 --> 00:03:45,008
我叫你处理这个
有好几个月了
I've been asking you
to get on this for months.

70
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,010
好吧，好吧，去吧！
AII right, fine, go!

71
00:03:47,052 --> 00:03:49,095
你们想刷房子？
去吧。刷房子吧
You want to paint the house?
Go. Paint the house.

72
00:03:49,137 --> 00:03:52,265
你知道吗？
也许你们三个可以一块刷？
You know what? Maybe aII three of you
can paint it together?

73
00:03:52,307 --> 00:03:54,225
- 这不是很温馨吗？
- 不
- WouIdn't that be nice?
- No.

74
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:55,852
不，看，今天星期六
No, Iook,
it's Saturday,

75
00:03:55,894 --> 00:03:58,813
我星期六有很多计划，好吗？
and I got a Iot of Saturday things
pIanned, okay?

76
00:03:59,898 --> 00:04:01,858
嘿，兔八哥！
嘿！
Hey, Bugs Bunny!
Hey!

77
00:04:01,858 --> 00:04:03,818
哦，这是什么？
Oh, what is this?

78
00:04:03,818 --> 00:04:06,112
猎鸭季节还是猎兔季节？
Duck season/rabbit season?

79
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,244
哦，小心，小心了
Oh, Iook out, Iook out.

80
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,131
雷蒙德？
Raymond?

81
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,473
- 雷蒙德？
- 什么？
- Raymond?
- What?

82
00:04:33,515 --> 00:04:37,018
这么说你能安心
让他们刷你的房子？
So you're fine with them
painting your house?

83
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,020
星期六
It's Saturday.

84
00:04:42,691 --> 00:04:46,069
好啦！对不起，孩子们
AII right!
Sorry, kids.

85
00:04:46,111 --> 00:04:50,365
看来爸爸不能再和你们享受
大好时光了
Guess Daddy isn't going to be abIe
to spend any more quaIity time with you.

86
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,706
嘿，你怎么样了？
Hey, what do you got?

87
00:04:57,747 --> 00:05:00,166
终于有卖你这么大个的冰棍了
They're finaIIy making
PopsicIes in your size?

88
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,420
你有完没完？
WouId you stop?

89
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:06,840
我没法忍受这老头了。
他要把我逼疯了
I can't take the oId man anymore.
He's driving me nuts.

90
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:08,466
来回支使得我像只猴子
Ordering me around
Iike a monkey.

91
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,218
书上有的词
都成我的绰号了
CaIIing me
every name in the book--

92
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,556
娘娘腔、粉扑、
公主……猴子
Nancy, powder puff,
princess... monkey.

93
00:05:14,556 --> 00:05:16,808
那又怎么样？
他叫我蠢蛋、
So? I'm getting dopey,

94
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,810
白痴、傻货
idiot, moron.

95
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:21,396
至少你的还说得通
At Ieast yours
make sense.

96
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:30,238
- 唔，祝你好运
- 哦，不。不不不！
- WeII, best of Iuck.
- Oh no. No no no!

97
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,240
拜托，你不能把我
一个人留下跟他！
Come on, you're not
Ieaving me here with him!

98
00:05:32,282 --> 00:05:35,243
你知道跟爸干活
会是什么样子
You knew what it was
going to be Iike working with Dad.

99
00:05:36,328 --> 00:05:38,413
他也有短处让我抓住，雷蒙德
I had him too, Raymond.

100
00:05:38,455 --> 00:05:40,415
他在楼梯上
He was up on the Iadder.

101
00:05:42,751 --> 00:05:45,170
看着会像事故
WouId have Iooked
Iike an accident.

102
00:05:46,463 --> 00:05:48,465
嘿！闲站着干什么？
Hey! What's with aII this
standing around?!

103
00:05:48,506 --> 00:05:50,592
你们给政府干活呢？
You two working
for the government?!

104
00:05:50,634 --> 00:05:52,260
不是！
No!

105
00:05:52,302 --> 00:05:55,472
唔，我不喜欢打断
营火女生（一家组织野营的公司）
的会议
WeII, I hate to break up this meeting
of the Camp Fire GirIs,

106
00:05:55,513 --> 00:05:57,182
不过咱们还是干活吧！
but Iet's get to work!

107
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:58,433
赶紧了！
Chop! Chop!

108
00:05:58,475 --> 00:06:01,061
- 我们在干活，爸
- 哦是吗？
- We're working, Dad.
- Oh yeah?

109
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:04,314
漏堵上了吗（招摇够了吗），
查泰莱夫人？
Are you finished cauIking,
Lady ChatterIey?

110
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,776
这句不错
That is a good one.

111
00:06:07,817 --> 00:06:09,903
你为什么不堵上？！
Why aren't you done
cauIking?!

112
00:06:09,944 --> 00:06:12,155
排雨管边上有马蜂窝
There's a wasps' nest
by the down spout.

113
00:06:12,197 --> 00:06:15,200
那就拿棍子捅下来
So, you take a stick
and knock it down.

114
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:18,495
那是马蜂，
它们不会喜欢的
They're wasps.
They don't Iike that.

115
00:06:18,536 --> 00:06:20,789
哦，那就这么办……
Oh, weII here's
what you do...

116
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,290
要是它们赶你，
if they come at you,

117
00:06:22,332 --> 00:06:24,918
把裙子掀起来遮住头
然后跑
you puII your skirt
over your head and run.

118
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,379
好吧
AII right.

119
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,257
嘿，爸。他不用赌那个排雨管。
没什么重要的
Hey, Dad. He doesn't have to cauIk by
the down spout. It's not that important.

120
00:06:31,299 --> 00:06:33,259
我说重要就重要
It's important
if I say it's important.

121
00:06:33,301 --> 00:06:35,595
好吧，可这是我的房子
Okay, but this is my house.

122
00:06:35,637 --> 00:06:37,597
这是我的活！
This is my job!

123
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,557
人家看见我在这干活
PeopIe see me
working out here.

124
00:06:39,557 --> 00:06:42,477
他们会知道是弗兰克・巴伦
干的活
They're going to know
that Frank Barone did this job,

125
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:44,938
所以必须干好了！
so it's going
to get done right!

126
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:46,815
你怎么还在这？
Why are you stiII here?

127
00:06:47,857 --> 00:06:49,317
我――我不认为――
I-- I don't think--

128
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:51,277
嘿，嘿，只是些虫子
Hey, hey, it's just
a coupIe of bugs.

129
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,238
拿东西捅下来――
Knock it down
with something--

130
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,198
棍子、笤帚！
A stick, a broom!

131
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,492
你的小指头！
我不管！
Your pinky!
I don't care!

132
00:06:57,534 --> 00:06:59,786
上去把那个窝捅下来！
Get up there
and knock out that nest!

133
00:06:59,828 --> 00:07:02,580
好吧！
AII right!

134
00:07:07,585 --> 00:07:10,839
你又在干嘛？
你是刮漆还是要跳舞？
And what about you? Are you going
to scrape that paint or do a dance?

135
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,300
我刮着呢
I'm scraping.

136
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:15,260
喔啊，等等，爸
Whoa, wait a minute, Dad.

137
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:18,179
颜色不对。戴比拉想要白色的
You got the wrong coIor.
Debra wanted white.

138
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:19,723
这很接近了
This is cIose.

139
00:07:19,764 --> 00:07:23,018
这不接近，
这是黄色的
It's not cIose,
it's yeIIow.

140
00:07:23,018 --> 00:07:26,021
她要白色的。
她说了山提利（巴黎北部小村，
以瓷器、蕾丝驰名）蕾丝
She wants white.
She said ChantiIIy Lace.

141
00:07:26,062 --> 00:07:29,357
唔，这是柠檬奶油
WeII this is
Lemon Meringue.

142
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,693
唔，你干嘛买黄色的？
WeII, why did you
get yeIIow?

143
00:07:31,735 --> 00:07:33,653
因为黄色更好
Because yeIIow is better.

144
00:07:33,695 --> 00:07:35,864
是，可黛比拉喜欢白色
Yeah, but Debra Iikes white.

145
00:07:35,905 --> 00:07:39,409
唔，我不管黛比拉喜欢什么，
我也不管你喜欢什么！
WeII I don't care what Debra Iikes,
and I don't care what you Iike!

146
00:07:39,451 --> 00:07:41,119
买了黄色了，好吧？！
It's yeIIow, okay?!

147
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:43,079
咱们就刷黄色的！
And we're doing it yeIIow!

148
00:07:43,121 --> 00:07:45,040
啊！水管！
Ah! Hose!

149
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:47,042
拿水管来！
Get the hose!

150
00:07:49,878 --> 00:07:51,838
大宝宝
Big baby.

151
00:07:55,425 --> 00:07:57,010
听着，爸，我得告诉你
Listen, Dad,
I got to teII you.

152
00:07:57,052 --> 00:07:59,387
不只是黛比拉，好吗？
我也喜欢山提利蕾丝
It's not onIy Debra, okay?
I want ChantiIIy Lace too.

153
00:07:59,387 --> 00:08:01,348
爸，你听到我说的了吗？
Dad, do you hear
what I'm saying?!

154
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:03,475
别把我房子刷黄了。爸！
Don't paint
my house yeIIow. Dad!

155
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,685
别开那个罐子！
Don't you open
that paint can!

156
00:08:05,727 --> 00:08:08,647
爸，你没听我的话
Dad, you're not
Iistening to me.

157
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:13,985
爸，不要搅那个漆
Dad, don't you
stir that paint.

158
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,612
你要是搅那个漆――
If you stir that paint--

159
00:08:15,654 --> 00:08:18,448
好了，现在你得退
搅过的漆了
Okay, you're just going
to have to return stirred paint now.

160
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,408
因为你开了罐子，
And now that the can's open,

161
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,577
你只能付钱了，好吗？
you're going to have
to pay for it, okay?

162
00:08:22,619 --> 00:08:25,872
因为我是绝对不会付
柠檬奶油的钱的。听到了吗？
'Cause I'm sure as heII not paying
for no Lemon Meringue. You hear me?

163
00:08:25,914 --> 00:08:29,334
我是――哦，你不能！
I'm-- oh no you don't!

164
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,336
不许你过去！
Don't you go near that!

165
00:08:31,336 --> 00:08:34,214
你听到了，爸？
不许――不许你蘸刷子！
You hear me, Dad?!
Don't you-- don't you dip that brush!

166
00:08:34,255 --> 00:08:35,840
你不能蘸刷子
You do not dip
that brush.

167
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,759
我警告你，爸，不要――
I'm warning you.
Dad, don't--

168
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:40,345
哦，爸，要是我看到你
用那把刷子刷，
Oh, Dad, if I see paint
on that brush,

169
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:41,805
好了，那是黄的
Okay, that's yeIIow.

170
00:08:41,846 --> 00:08:44,641
那是黄的。爸，
不许把我房子刷成黄的！
That's yeIIow. Dad, don't you paint
my house yeIIow!

171
00:08:44,683 --> 00:08:46,601
你听到没，爸？！
Do you hear me, Dad?!

172
00:08:46,643 --> 00:08:48,561
爸，我警告你！
Dad, I'm warning you!

173
00:08:51,815 --> 00:08:53,733
- 好了，好吧。到此为止
- 嘿！
- Okay, aII right. That's it.
- Hey!

174
00:08:53,775 --> 00:08:55,402
- 到此为止，回家去
- 什么？！
- That's it, go home.
- Excuse me?!

175
00:08:55,443 --> 00:08:57,278
看，如果你不照我想的做，
Look, if you're not going
to do what I want,

176
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,406
- 那就回家去
- 你不能告诉我怎么做
- then go home.
- You don't teII me what to do.

177
00:08:59,447 --> 00:09:02,367
我能只要这是我的房子！
这是我房子，我是老板，好吗？
I do when it's my house! And it's my house
and I'm the boss, okay?

178
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:05,203
- 所以你被解雇了
- 我被解雇了？！
- So you're fired.
- I'm fired?!

179
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:07,831
好了，我好了
Okay, I'm aII right now.

180
00:09:07,872 --> 00:09:10,375
嘿，听听这个，罗伯特。
雷蒙德说我被解雇了！
Hey, get a Ioad of this, Robert.
Raymond says I'm fired!

181
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:11,751
没错，你被解雇了！
That's right, you're fired!

182
00:09:11,793 --> 00:09:13,712
你炒了他？
You fired him?

183
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:16,464
想炒了我吗？
You want to fire me?

184
00:09:16,506 --> 00:09:18,591
- 你不能解雇我！
- 看，爸，
- You can't fire me!
- Look, Dad,

185
00:09:18,633 --> 00:09:21,344
我不是小孩子了，好吗？
我不喜欢你对我的方式，
I'm not a kid anymore, okay?
I don't Iike the way you treat me

186
00:09:21,386 --> 00:09:24,347
我也不喜欢你对待助手的方式，
所以，到此为止
and I don't Iike the way
you treat the heIp either, so that's it.

187
00:09:29,644 --> 00:09:30,729
好吧！
Fine!

188
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,897
刷你自己的破房子吧
Paint your own damn house.

189
00:09:38,903 --> 00:09:41,906
- 喔
- 没错
- Wow.
- That's right.

190
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,867
现在这归我管了
Now I'm in charge of this now.

191
00:09:43,908 --> 00:09:47,287
好了，咱们要做的第一件事……
Okay, and the first thing
we're going to do...

192
00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:49,414
午饭
Iunch.

193
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:52,375
- 好的，可现在才9：30
- 午饭！
- Yeah, but it's onIy 9:30--
- Lunch!

194
00:09:53,877 --> 00:09:56,796
嘿，你不能这么进来，
你水嗒嗒的
Hey, you can't come in
Iike that, you're soaking wet.

195
00:10:01,485 --> 00:10:04,821
我还在想这有多好，
巴伦家所有男人一块干活
Here I thought it'd be so nice,
aII the Barone men working together.

196
00:10:04,863 --> 00:10:08,200
没人能和爸一起干活，
你替他干活
No one works with Dad,
you work for him.

197
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,160
因为没人能做得对，除了他
'Cause nobody can do
anything right except him.

198
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,413
- 是的，还记得那个堡垒吗？
- 没错
- Yeah, remember the fort?
- That's right.

199
00:10:13,455 --> 00:10:15,791
罗伯特和我在我们家后院
修了个堡垒――
Robert and I were buiIding a fort
in our backyard--

200
00:10:15,832 --> 00:10:18,669
没什么特别的，
就是个小堡垒
nothing fancy,
just this IittIe fort.

201
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:21,296
是的，一个能让我们看漫画书和……
Yeah, just a pIace we couId read
our comic books and...

202
00:10:21,338 --> 00:10:23,298
其他杂志的地方
other periodicaIs.

203
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:30,055
呃呵！
Ugh!

204
00:10:31,723 --> 00:10:34,977
咱们那时候多开心哪，
自己修堡垒，是吧？
And we were having fun too, buiIding
the fort aII by ourseIves, right?

205
00:10:35,018 --> 00:10:37,437
知道爸爸回来说
我们修的完全不对
TiII Dad came home and toId us
we were doing it aII wrong.

206
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:39,856
是的。也不告诉我们怎么做才对，
Yeah. Didn't show us
how to do it right,

207
00:10:39,898 --> 00:10:42,818
光叫我们傻瓜、臭屁股，
然后自己做了
just caIIed us stupid, stinking humps
and did it himseIf.

208
00:10:42,859 --> 00:10:47,239
这就是为什么当你生气
我不是这最能干的人，
That's why when you get mad that I'm not
the handiest guy around here,

209
00:10:47,281 --> 00:10:50,242
你知道，这让我感慨万千
you know, it brings up
a Iot of stuff.

210
00:10:52,494 --> 00:10:54,413
真替你难过
I'm sorry.

211
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:56,373
这么说跟你人懒
So it has nothing to do
with you being Iazy

212
00:10:56,415 --> 00:10:58,375
并且只知道
看电视没关系？
and watching TV
aII the time?

213
00:11:00,335 --> 00:11:02,296
我是在遮盖伤口
That's how
I cover the hurt.

214
00:11:05,924 --> 00:11:07,342
- 嗨，玛丽
- 哈喽，亲爱的
- Hi, Marie.
- HeIIo, dear.

215
00:11:07,384 --> 00:11:09,428
你好呀，吗。
嗷！
Hiya, Ma.
Ow!

216
00:11:10,596 --> 00:11:12,889
- 你干什么？！
- 你们就是
- What are you doing?!
- This is how

217
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:14,975
- 这么照看你爸的？！
- 我做什么了？！
you watch out for your father?
- What did I do?!

218
00:11:15,017 --> 00:11:17,519
- 你们让他到处搬梯子！
- 他没有搬梯子
- You made him carry Iadders around!
- He didn't carry Iadders.

219
00:11:17,561 --> 00:11:19,479
- 那他怎么扭了背？
- 什么？！
- Then how did he wrench his back?
- What?!

220
00:11:19,521 --> 00:11:21,440
他扛梯子的时候扭了背
He wrenched his back
carrying Iadders.

221
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:24,484
现在他躺在我的沙发上叫汤
Now he's Iying on my couch
demanding soup.

222
00:11:24,526 --> 00:11:26,320
别告诉他我跟你们说了
And don't teII him
I toId you about this.

223
00:11:26,361 --> 00:11:28,280
他不想让我
闹得沸沸扬扬
He didn't want me
to make a big deaI out of it.

224
00:11:28,363 --> 00:11:32,117
- 那你怎么来了？
- 我不听他的
- So why are you over here?
- I don't Iisten to him.

225
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,369
他的背没事，妈。
我让他回去的
His back is fine, Ma.
I sent him home.

226
00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:36,830
- 我不明白
- 他老讨人嫌，
- I don't understand.
- He was being a big jerk,

227
00:11:36,872 --> 00:11:38,832
所以我炒了他
so I fired him.

228
00:11:40,918 --> 00:11:42,836
什么意思你炒了他？
What do you mean
you fired him?

229
00:11:42,878 --> 00:11:44,421
你炒了你父亲？
You fired your father?

230
00:11:44,463 --> 00:11:46,632
不得已而为之，妈
Had to be done, Ma.

231
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:49,259
你怎么能那么对他？！
How couId you
do that to him?!

232
00:11:49,301 --> 00:11:51,803
什么意思他？
那他又是怎么对我们的？
What do you mean him?
What about what he does to us?

233
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:55,015
咱们说的不是这个！
哦……
We're not taIking
about that! Oh...

234
00:11:55,057 --> 00:11:58,560
我真是――哦天
I so-- oh God.

235
00:11:58,602 --> 00:12:00,520
好吧……
AII right...

236
00:12:00,562 --> 00:12:03,190
你爸有件事你们不知道
there's something about your father
you don't know.

237
00:12:07,277 --> 00:12:09,196
他穿你的东西？
He wears your things?

238
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,495
什么，玛丽？
What is it, Marie?

239
00:12:17,788 --> 00:12:20,958
你爸从没从帕尔克
会计事务所退休
Your father never retired
from PeIk Accounting.

240
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:22,459
你说什么？
What are you
taIking about?

241
00:12:22,501 --> 00:12:24,836
如果他没退休，
那他干嘛
If he's not retired,
why does he

242
00:12:24,836 --> 00:12:27,089
上药店买裤子
（算到医疗保险里）？
buy his pants
at the pharmacy?

243
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,383
他告诉我他退休了，
He toId me he retired,

244
00:12:29,424 --> 00:12:31,385
可我发现了事实
but I found out the truth.

245
00:12:31,385 --> 00:12:33,345
他们解雇了他
They fired him.

246
00:12:33,345 --> 00:12:35,305
什么？
What?

247
00:12:35,305 --> 00:12:37,557
- 为什么？
- 为什么？
- Why?
- Why?

248
00:12:37,599 --> 00:12:39,559
还要我告诉你？
I have to teII you?

249
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:45,983
你为什么解雇他？
Why did you fire him?

250
00:12:46,024 --> 00:12:49,570
你爸相信他的做事方法
是唯一的方法
Your father beIieves that his way
of doing things is the onIy way.

251
00:12:49,611 --> 00:12:52,864
而过了25年后，
这让人不舒服了
And after 25 years,
it starts to get on peopIe's nerves.

252
00:12:55,325 --> 00:12:57,619
这么说弗兰克从没告诉你
他被解雇了？
So Frank never toId you
he was fired?

253
00:12:57,661 --> 00:12:59,580
他怎么能？
How couId he?

254
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:01,039
你不明白，黛比拉
You don't understand, Debra.

255
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:03,125
我们那辈人，
In my generation,

256
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:06,628
男人工作，并且工作代表了
他是什么
the men had their jobs
and that's who they were.

257
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:09,756
哦，让那个小个艾文・帕尔克解雇
Oh, it must have been
so humiIiating for Frank

258
00:13:09,798 --> 00:13:13,176
对弗兰克一定是极大的羞辱
to have that IittIe AIvin PeIk
fire him from his job.

259
00:13:13,176 --> 00:13:16,680
而现在你们俩儿子
对他作了同样的事！
And now you boys just did
the same thing to him!

260
00:13:20,017 --> 00:13:21,977
是雷蒙德
It was Raymond.

261
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:26,356
嘿――不
Hey-- no.

262
00:13:26,398 --> 00:13:29,151
行了，看。
这不一样，好吗？
Come on, Iook. This isn't
the same thing, okay?

263
00:13:29,192 --> 00:13:31,778
这不是他的职业，
这是我的房子
This wasn't his career,
this was my house.

264
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,572
- 他还有什么？！
- 你的房子
- What eIse does he have?!
- Your house.

265
00:13:33,614 --> 00:13:35,490
那个他刷过了！
He did that aIready!

266
00:13:35,532 --> 00:13:38,619
看，妈，我想你反应过度了，
好吗？不是什么大不了的！
Look, Ma, I think you're overreacting,
okay? This wasn't that big of deaI!

267
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,829
足够大到让他跟我
It was a big enough deaI
for him to make up a story

268
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:42,789
编扭到背的故事
to me about hurting his back.

269
00:13:42,831 --> 00:13:46,877
你是他儿子。你认为
这会让他有什么感受？
You're his son. How do you think
that made him feeI?

270
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:50,297
- 我希望你高兴了，雷蒙德
- 哦……闭嘴！
- I hope you're happy, Raymond.
- Oh... shut up!

271
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:52,257
我为什么要担心他的感受？
And why shouId I worry
about his feeIings?

272
00:13:52,257 --> 00:13:54,051
他从不关心其他任何人
He doesn't care
about anybody eIse's.

273
00:13:54,092 --> 00:13:57,012
你认为他不关心你？
You don't think
he cares about you?

274
00:13:57,054 --> 00:14:00,223
他是你父亲。他只是不擅长――
He's your father.
He just isn't good at--

275
00:14:00,265 --> 00:14:02,225
生活在人类中间
Living among humans.

276
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,730
你知道，我想你是唯一
觉得自己有意思的人
You know, I think you're the onIy one
who thinks you're funny.

277
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:11,443
这话没错
Amen to that.

278
00:14:13,028 --> 00:14:15,906
- 来，来。去那边――
- 不不不，妈
- Come on, come on. Go over there--
- No no no, Ma.

279
00:14:15,906 --> 00:14:17,908
看，我遗憾他的一辈子，好吗？
Look, I'm sorry
about his whoIe Iife, okay?

280
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,868
可他在这完全错了
But he was
compIeteIy wrong here.

281
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,536
他想把我的房子刷成黄的！
He wanted to paint
my house yeIIow!

282
00:14:21,578 --> 00:14:23,455
- 黄色？
- 是的，你能相信吗？
- YeIIow?
- Yeah, you beIieve that?

283
00:14:23,497 --> 00:14:25,457
喔
Wow.

284
00:14:25,457 --> 00:14:28,669
实际上，黄色也不错
ActuaIIy, yeIIow wouId
be kind of nice.

285
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,088
- 什么？
- 唔，我喜欢黄色
- What?
- WeII, I Iike yeIIow.

286
00:14:31,129 --> 00:14:33,048
看，你说的山提利蕾丝
Look, you said
ChantiIIy Lace.

287
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,008
我听到你说的
山提利蕾丝！
I heard you say
ChantiIIy Lace!

288
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,843
我为你的山提利蕾丝抗争，
I fought for your damn
ChantiIIy Lace,

289
00:14:36,885 --> 00:14:38,345
而你现在又说黄色？！
and now you're
saying yeIIow?!

290
00:14:38,387 --> 00:14:41,139
你是谁啊？！
Who are you?!

291
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:44,226
怎么了？我只是从没想到黄色
What? YeIIow just never
occurred to me.

292
00:14:44,268 --> 00:14:46,353
可是，你知道，
事实上那看着阳光
But, you know,
it's actuaIIy kind of sunny.

293
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:49,815
你听到了，好吗？
这就是婚姻
You hear this, okay?
This is marriage.

294
00:14:49,815 --> 00:14:53,485
这就是你想要的？
这就是你没了活不了的？
This is what you want?
This is what you can't Iive without?

295
00:14:53,527 --> 00:14:55,487
让位吧
Step aside.

296
00:14:57,239 --> 00:14:59,783
雷蒙德，去和你爸谈谈
Raymond, go taIk
to your father.

297
00:14:59,825 --> 00:15:01,702
- 不不！
- 你知道，你应该的
- No no!
- You know, you shouId.

298
00:15:01,743 --> 00:15:03,495
哦，对不起。
谁在说话？
Oh, excuse me.
Who's speaking?

299
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:06,498
白的黛比拉
还是黄的黛比拉？
Is that white Debra
or yeIIow Debra?

300
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,668
你知道，你真的应该。
我知道你爸有时的确讨厌
You know, you reaIIy shouId. I know your
father can be a reaI jerk sometimes.

301
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,296
是的，这点没人能反对
Right, no one
is arguing that.

302
00:15:12,337 --> 00:15:14,590
他欺负人，他倔脾气，
He's a buIIy, he's obstinate

303
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:16,883
而且他不天天洗澡
and he doesn't
bathe every day.

304
00:15:16,925 --> 00:15:20,554
可是我知道这个人，
而且我知道他需要一样东西
But I know that man
and I know he needs one thing.

305
00:15:21,722 --> 00:15:24,641
他需要被人需要
He needs to be needed.

306
00:15:26,643 --> 00:15:28,562
你看着办吧
Do with that what you wiII.

307
00:15:36,695 --> 00:15:38,655
他是你父亲
He's your father.

308
00:15:47,664 --> 00:15:49,625
- 嘿
- 嘿
- Hey.
- Hey.

309
00:15:52,544 --> 00:15:54,504
听着
Listen.

310
00:15:54,504 --> 00:15:56,465
之前的事对不起
I'm sorry about before.

311
00:15:56,506 --> 00:15:59,051
好了，那么……
Okay, so...

312
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:01,178
回那边
come back over

313
00:16:01,219 --> 00:16:04,181
咱们刷黄的。
黄的没事。我说服了黛比拉
and we'II do it yeIIow.
YeIIow's okay. I taIked Debra into it.

314
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,435
好吗？
Okay?

315
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:10,687
不
No.

316
00:16:10,729 --> 00:16:12,356
什么意思不？
What do you mean no?

317
00:16:13,815 --> 00:16:15,734
我的意思是，我没兴趣
I mean
I'm not interested.

318
00:16:15,776 --> 00:16:18,028
我现在忙着呢
I'm kind of busy
right now.

319
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,988
哦……
Oh...

320
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,532
是，我看到你的汤了
right, I see you got soup.

321
00:16:23,784 --> 00:16:25,869
还有拼图
And a puzzIe.

322
00:16:25,911 --> 00:16:29,248
唔，不是非得现在。
你想什么时候都可以
WeII, it doesn't have to be right now.
Whenever you feeI Iike it.

323
00:16:32,251 --> 00:16:35,837
什么，你拿锅吃
就因为不想洗个碗
What, you're eating out of a pot
'cause you don't Iike to cIean a bowI?

324
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:39,424
不，这样更好
No, it's better this way.

325
00:16:40,425 --> 00:16:42,344
哦
Oh.

326
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:46,306
嘿，眼力不错
Hey, that's a keen eye
you got there.

327
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:52,187
“石墙杰克森将军之死”
''The Death of GeneraI
StonewaII Jackson''.

328
00:16:52,229 --> 00:16:54,856
你喜欢这个？
You Iike this one?

329
00:16:54,898 --> 00:16:56,400
非常有意思的历史人物
Very interesting figure
in history.

330
00:16:56,441 --> 00:16:59,486
被认为是联盟军队（南军）
最好的将军
Considered the Confederacy's
finest generaI.

331
00:16:59,528 --> 00:17:02,281
被自己人打死
Shot by one
of his own men.

332
00:17:03,615 --> 00:17:05,534
好吧，你有完没完？
AII right, wiII you stop?

333
00:17:05,576 --> 00:17:07,494
天，真不相信
我还请你回去
God, I can't beIieve
I invited you back.

334
00:17:07,536 --> 00:17:09,580
我甚至不相信跟你道歉
I can't beIieve
I apoIogized to you even.

335
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:11,832
唔，你应该向我道歉，
我是对的！
WeII you shouId apoIogize
to me, I was right!

336
00:17:11,873 --> 00:17:13,959
你怎么对了？
你怎么对了？！
How are you right?
How are you right?!

337
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:16,628
那是我的房子
而你想刷成黄的！这是怎么对法？
It's my house and you wanted
to paint it yeIIow! How is that right?

338
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,256
因为黄的不显脏！
Because yeIIow
covers better!

339
00:17:19,298 --> 00:17:21,216
不会那么快褪色！
It won't fade as fast!

340
00:17:21,258 --> 00:17:24,469
而且你两边的房子都是白的！
And you got white houses
on either side of you!

341
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:27,431
这让你的房子看着出彩些！
It makes your house
pop a IittIe!

342
00:17:27,472 --> 00:17:31,059
配你的装修
和你家的狗屁小雏菊！
And it goes with your trim and
the frigging IittIe daisies you got!

343
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:37,858
唔，你干嘛不直说？
WeII, why didn't you
just say that?

344
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,402
- 我不应该非得说出来！
- 什么？
- I shouIdn't have to say it!
- What?

345
00:17:40,444 --> 00:17:43,405
因为如果我说了黄色，
那就应该对你够好了！
Because if I say it's yeIIow,
that shouId be good enough for you!

346
00:17:43,447 --> 00:17:45,657
我不应该什么都得解释！
I shouIdn't have
to expIain everything!

347
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:47,075
我是对的！
I'm right!

348
00:17:48,911 --> 00:17:51,580
好吧，你是对的，
可并不总是对错的问题
Okay, you're right,
but it's not aIways about being right.

349
00:17:51,622 --> 00:17:54,207
是，当然是！
对的才是唯一重要的
Yes, it is!
Being right is aII that matters.

350
00:17:54,249 --> 00:17:56,418
别的都是狗屁
Everything eIse is crap!

351
00:17:57,669 --> 00:18:00,088
“哦，你得考虑别人的感受”
''Oh, you have to consider
peopIe's feeIings.''

352
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,090
“哦，要是他们
不喜欢你怎么办？”
''Oh, what if they
don't Iike you?''

353
00:18:03,592 --> 00:18:06,136
他们应该喜欢我，
因为我做得对！
They shouId Iike me
because I did the job right!

354
00:18:06,178 --> 00:18:09,598
是，如果你在灯塔工作
这绝对有道理！
Yeah, that makes perfect sense
if you work in a Iighthouse!

355
00:18:11,975 --> 00:18:16,021
没错。
只要不是和人在一起！
ExactIy. I'd be fine
if it weren't for peopIe!

356
00:18:16,063 --> 00:18:19,149
哦，都是那些该死的人！
唔，你忘了一件事――
Oh, it's those damn peopIe!
WeII, you're forgetting one thing--

357
00:18:19,191 --> 00:18:20,984
我和罗伯特也是人！
me and Robert
are peopIe too!

358
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:39,753
怎么，你们俩要自己刷了？
So what, are the two of you going
to paint the house now by yourseIves?

359
00:18:39,795 --> 00:18:42,339
是的
Yeah.

360
00:18:44,716 --> 00:18:47,261
如果你想让我帮你，
我会帮你的
If you want me to heIp you,
I'II heIp you.

361
00:18:49,054 --> 00:18:50,555
好吧
Okay.

362
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:53,684
不过你要是叫我帮忙，
But if you're
asking for my heIp,

363
00:18:53,725 --> 00:18:56,895
咱们就得照我的做，
因为那是对的
we got to do it my way,
because it's the right way.

364
00:18:56,937 --> 00:18:58,855
好吧
AII right.

365
00:18:58,897 --> 00:19:01,608
- 用黄的
- 我说了用黄的
- With the yeIIow.
- I said with the yeIIow.

366
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,902
并且没人告诉我怎么做
And nobody teIIs me
what to do.

367
00:19:03,944 --> 00:19:05,862
得我说了算，
I get to be in charge,

368
00:19:05,904 --> 00:19:07,823
我是老板，怎么样？
I get to be the boss,
aII right?

369
00:19:07,864 --> 00:19:09,783
好吧，爸，你是老板
AII right, Dad,
you're the boss.

370
00:19:09,825 --> 00:19:11,743
- 我是老板？
- 是的
- I'm the boss?
- Yes.
