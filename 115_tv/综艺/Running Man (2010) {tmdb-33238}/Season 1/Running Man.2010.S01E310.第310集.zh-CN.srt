嘿
Hey.

00:00:05,337 --> 00:00:07,362
嗨，宝贝
要来点鸡蛋吗？
Hi, honey.
Want some eggs?

3
00:00:07,406 --> 00:00:11,001
别听她的，这根本不是鸡蛋
Don't listen to her.
lt's not eggs.

4
00:00:11,043 --> 00:00:13,341
这是人工合成的狗屁鸡蛋
lt's that fake egg crap.

5
00:00:15,114 --> 00:00:17,480
吃起来跟天然的一模一样
lt tastes exactly
the same.

6
00:00:17,516 --> 00:00:20,314
是啊，跟天然的狗屁一模一样
Yes, exactly like crap.

7
00:00:23,355 --> 00:00:25,687
你干嘛做人工鸡蛋？
Why are you making
fake eggs?

8
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:28,888
你爸爸和我昨天去了“老年人健康博览会”
Your father and l went
to the Senior Health Fair yesterday.

9
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,795
老年人健康博览会？
Senior Health Fair?

10
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:34,231
博览些什么啊？
What are the rides
there?

11
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:37,235
发牢骚？
The complain￡-a￡-go￡-round?

12
00:00:37,269 --> 00:00:40,636
出气筒？
Tunnel of gas?

13
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:43,141
我们测了胆固醇
We had our cholesterol
checked

14
00:00:43,175 --> 00:00:45,769
我们两个都接近危险界限了
and the both of us are very
close to the danger zone.

15
00:00:45,811 --> 00:00:48,405
我的比她的低
Mine was lower
than hers.

16
00:00:48,447 --> 00:00:50,642
只低了1个百分点
One point lower.

17
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:52,776
那我还是会活得比你长
l'm still gonna live
longer than you.

18
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,949
是吗？长30秒？
What, 30 seconds?

19
00:00:55,988 --> 00:00:59,446
在乐园里的30秒
30 seconds in paradise.

20
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,166
听着，罗密欧和朱丽叶
Uh, listen,
Romeo and Juliet,

21
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,566
我要借个垃圾袋
l'm gonna borrow
a garbage bag.

22
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:13,003
你说借是什么意思？
难道你还要还回来？
What do you mean borrow?
You're gonna give it back?

23
00:01:13,038 --> 00:01:16,337
好吧，我要偷一个垃圾袋
All right,
l'm stealing a garbage bag.

24
00:01:18,477 --> 00:01:21,344
－ 这是什么鬼东西？
－ 给你冲咖啡的牛奶
￡- What the hell is that?
￡- lt's milk for your coffee.

25
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,348
－ 这不是我的牛奶
－ 这就是平时喝的牛奶
￡- That's not my milk.
￡- That's regular milk.

26
00:01:23,382 --> 00:01:25,407
不应该是蓝盒子的。给我！
Not in a blue carton,
it's not. Give me that.

27
00:01:26,952 --> 00:01:29,250
脱脂牛奶！
Skim!

28
00:01:29,288 --> 00:01:32,314
－ 这对你有好处
－ 我不要什么好处
￡- lt's better for you.
￡- Don't give me better.

29
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:35,418
看，融化不了
Look, it's not even mixing.

30
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:38,191
咖啡甚至都不认识它
The coffee doesn't even
recognize it.

31
00:01:41,867 --> 00:01:44,097
如果你不喝，我就……
lf you don't drink that,
l'm gonna￡-￡-

32
00:01:44,136 --> 00:01:47,037
什么？你就会怎样？
What?
What are you gonna do?

33
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:49,666
离开我？
Leave me?

34
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:51,835
嘿，雷，等一会
Hey, Ray, wait a second.

35
00:01:51,877 --> 00:01:54,004
就一会，儿子
One moment, son.

36
00:01:54,046 --> 00:01:55,570
噢，弗兰克！
Oh, Frank!

37
00:01:55,614 --> 00:01:57,047
嘿，再去拿一个袋
Hey, gotta get
another bag.

38
00:01:57,082 --> 00:01:59,346
你妈妈要打包
Your mother
needs to pack.

39
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:02,786
弗兰克，健康展上的年轻人说……
Frank, the young man
at the Health Fair said￡-￡-

40
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:04,722
愚蠢的健康展
That stupid Health Fair.

41
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:07,191
我进去找杂货店买巧克力球
l go in there looking
for a chocolate cone at the drugstore,

42
00:02:07,226 --> 00:02:09,490
谁知莫名其妙就被量了血压
next thing l know l'm getting
my blood pressure taken.

43
00:02:09,528 --> 00:02:11,359
我的血压比你的健康
My blood pressure
was better than yours.

44
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,922
但我的视力比你好
But l won
the eyesight thing.

45
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:18,197
所以你们去测了胆固醇
想打破平局？
So did you have the cholesterol
checked to break the tie?

46
00:02:19,271 --> 00:02:22,104
是的，我赢了
Yeah and l won.

47
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:25,076
我们还在等尿检结果
We're waiting for
the urine test.

48
00:02:26,745 --> 00:02:31,079
如果你爸爸血糖高的话，我还是可以扳平的
l could still tie if your father
has high blood sugar.

49
00:02:31,116 --> 00:02:34,711
在那之前我要吃我想吃的东西
天然鸡蛋和全脂牛奶
Until then l'm eating what l want
and l want real eggs and real milk.

50
00:02:34,753 --> 00:02:37,779
那你最好去lHOP,
因为从现在开始
Then you better go to lHOP,
because from now on

51
00:02:37,823 --> 00:02:40,121
在这所房子里我们必须吃健康食品
把那个给我
we're eating healthy in this house.
Give me that.

52
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,150
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

嘿，那个给我好了
Hey, l could have that one.

57
00:02:50,836 --> 00:02:54,738

00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,408
－给你
－谢谢
Here, thank you.

60
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:02,073
你要去哪里？
Where are you going?

61
00:03:02,114 --> 00:03:04,207
去野餐
On a picnic.

62
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,552
旧袋子出
Out with the old bag,

63
00:03:10,589 --> 00:03:12,580
新袋子进
in with the new!

00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:20,962
看，你根本不必用黄油
And look, you never
have to use butter.

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,059
人们现在都用橄榄油代替
They have olive oil
in a spray now.

66
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:25,662
闻闻，闻闻这个
Smell, smell this.

67

－ 噢，真香
－ 唔～
￡- Ooh, nice.
￡- Mm￡-hmm.

涂一点在你的耳后
You put a little of that
behind your ears,

69
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,071
弗兰克会神魂颠倒的
Frank will be all

00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,548
－你这么觉得？

￡- You think?
￡- Mm￡-hmm.

嘿，黛博拉

00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:54,565
雷蒙德，黛博拉教了我好多烹饪技巧
Raymond, Debra's teaching me
so much about cooking.

74
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:57,195
你跟黛博拉学烹饪？
You're learning cooking
from Debra?

75
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,761
好吧，OK
Yeah, okay.

76
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,672
天堂在地下，地狱在天上
So heaven is here,
hell is here.

77
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:05,508
天上下猴子，木头可以当酒喝
lt's raining monkeys
and wood is now a drink.

78
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:09,304
看看黛博拉给我的书
And look at this book
Debra gave me.

79
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:12,477
“厨房健康101招”
"101 Healthy Things
to Do in the Kitchen".

80
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:16,352
在这个厨房，最健康的一招就是――嘿～～
ln this kitchen, the healthiest thing
to do is, whee!

81
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:20,826
噢

我希望今年重新来过
l wish l had started
this years ago.

84
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:31,826
我觉得精力充沛，活力四射
l feel so snappy and peppy.

85
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,339
妈，我以为你这么做只不过是为了惩罚爸爸
Ma, l thought you were doing this
just to annoy Dad.

86
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,638
那是意外的奖励
That's a bonus.

87
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:39,167
玛丽，过来看看
这里有个专栏
Oh, Marie, come here, look,

－ 是啊
￡- Oh￡-ooh, a Thanksgiving!

Oh, l can't wait to make
some of these things.

91
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,652
哇～哇～哇
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

92
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,450
你不能这么对待感恩节
You're not gonna do this
for Thanksgiving.

93
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:51,252
就因为是感恩节才要这么过
Especially Thanksgiving.

94
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,350
你还是……
You're still gonna make
the real food

95
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,623
会为我们做真正的食物的
是不是？
for us though,
right?

96
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,357
我猜我会的
l guess l could.

97
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:01,026
不，雷
你妈妈不会做分开做两顿的
No, no, Ray, your mother's not
gonna cook two separate meals.

98
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:04,002
为什么不？嗯？
Why not?
Huh?

99
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,561
她爱烹饪，黛博拉
She loves to cook, Debra.

100
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:08,369
你凭什么剥夺她这个爱好？
Who are you to take
that away from her?

101
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,205
－看看这个
－唔
￡- Look at this.
￡- Mm￡-hmm.

102

豆腐火鸡？
A tofu turkey?

103
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,644
是啊，看起来不错，嗯？
Yeah.
lt looks good, huh?

104
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:17,809
我宁可吃那页纸
l would rather eat
that page.

105
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,913
书上说你需要一个特别的模具
Oh, it says here
you need a special mold

106
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:25,389
把豆腐做成火鸡的形状
to shape the tofu
into a turkey.

107
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,893
不，你不需要什么模具，妈
No, you don't need
a mold, Ma, okay?

108
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:30,327
上帝才需要
God does that, yeah.

109
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:33,355
他用一整团鸟肉
He takes a whole bunch
of bird meat

110
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,924
做成一只火鸡
and he molds
it into a turkey.

111
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:37,128
行了，雷
Come on, Ray.

112
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,230
我在宣扬圣经，黛博拉
l'm quoting the Bible here,
Debra, okay?

113
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,833
别担心，雷蒙德
会很美味的
Don't worry, Raymond,
it will be delicious,

114
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,274
就像我做的任何东西一样
like everything else
that l cook.

115
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:48,075
噢，我保证
Oh, l promise.

116
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:51,242
而且我不会忘记放最重要的原料
l'm not gonna leave out
the most important ingredient.

117
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,684
火鸡？
Turkey?

118
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,348
－ 爱
－ 爱？
￡- Love.
￡- Love?

119
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,789
你会没事的
You'll live.

120
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,422
OK，可以吃了
Okay, we're ready.

121
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:09,060
这是清蒸蔬菜，加了新鲜柠檬汁
Here's the steamed veggies
with fresh lemon juice.

122
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,866
噢，玛丽，看起来真不错
Oh, Marie,

123
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,872
我一会就来
And l'll be right back

124
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:16,636
带着豆腐火鸡
with the tofu turkey.

125
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:18,769
就是我闻到的那股味道吗？
Mmm, is that what
l'm smelling?

126
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,642
端上来吧，妈
Bring it on there, Ma.

127
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,179
豆腐火鸡！
Tofu turkey!

128
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,676
我本应该坐在自己的公寓里
吃着牛排大餐
l could be sitting in my apartment
eating Beef￡-A￡-Roni right now.

129
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,246
OK，来吧，弗兰克
可以吃饭了
Okay, come on, Frank,
we're ready.

130
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,724
我弃权
l pass.

131
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,228
弗兰克，听着
Okay, Frank, listen,

132
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:38,662
玛丽为大家做了一顿很棒的晚餐
Marie has cooked
a very nice meal for everyone

133
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:41,394
你们得坐下来，吃饭
and you are going to sit
at that table and eat it.

134
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,925
－ 但我不想吃
－ 没什么好商量的
￡- But l don't want to.
￡- We are not discussing this.

135
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,528
我数到三。
一……
You have till
the count of three. One,

136
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,970

－ 很好
￡- All right, all right.
￡- Good.

138
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:56,247
看，这才像一个家庭
Okay, so see,
this is a family.

139
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,918
嗒～达
Ta￡-da!

140
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:08,391
唔
Mmm!

141
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:12,057
孩子们，看奶奶做了什么
Kids, look
what Grandma made!

142
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,066
啊？
Huh?

143
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,295
怎么样？嗯？
How 'bout that, huh?

144
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:19,862
看，还晃晃悠悠的呢
Look how it...
jiggles.

145
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:25,776
说明这是只好豆腐鸟
Yeah, that's a sign
of a good bean curd bird.

146
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,440
把刀子递给我好吗
May l have
my carving knife, please?

147
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,039
谢谢，弗兰克
Thank you, Frank.

148
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,915
刺穿我的喉咙算了
l wanna slit my throat.

149
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,154
好吧，我来
All right, l got it.
l got it.

150
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:41,683
好了，你想要什么？
All right,
what do you want?

151
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:44,355
给我一条腿
Give me a leg.

152
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,592
OK
Okay.

153
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,447
好吧，你自己挑
All right, we've got￡-￡- look, we've got￡-￡-
here's your choices.

154
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,112
这里是浅色的部分
We got the light￡-￡-
light over here.

155
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,213
深色的在那里
食用色素沉淀的地方
We got dark where
the food coloring has puddled.

156
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:11,951
行了，把这个给我
All right,
just give me this.

157
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:15,688
不是食用色素
是辣酱油和甜菜汁
lt's not food coloring.
lt's Worcestershire and beet juice.

158
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:18,629
看看，多聪明
Oh, see, that's very clever.

159
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,895
你干嘛不把你的狗带来，罗伯特？
Why didn't you bring
your dog, Robert?

160
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:25,267
我觉得沙姆斯基不会吃这个的
l don't think Shamsky
would eat this.

161
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:27,363
是的，不过我们可以吃它
Yeah, but we could
eat him.

162
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,747
来吧，罗比
尝尝看
Go ahead, Robby,
try some.

163
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:39,342
－ 雷蒙德怎么不吃
－ 我已经吃过了
￡- What about Raymond?
￡- l had some already.

164
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:40,613
－ 你没吃
－ 我吃了
￡- No you didn't.
￡- Yes l did.

165
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,518
－ 你没吃！
－ 我吃了！
￡- No you didn't.
￡- l did!

166
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:46,286
我吃了，就在这里
你看不出来，是因为豆腐又弹回来了
l did, from right here.
You can't tell 'cause it morphs back.

167
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,350
行了行了
All right, all right!

168
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,658
我们都要吃
We are all eating some.

169
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:54,989
弗兰克
Frank.

170
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,775
吞下去
Swallow it.

171
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,022
雷，雷！
Ray. Ray!

172
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:39,944
来吧，罗伯特
Go ahead, Robert.

173
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:09,263
我从没想过我会吃这个，
把花椰菜递给我行吗？
l never thought l'd say this,
but could you pass the broccoli please?

174
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:14,612
事实上我觉得很美味
Actually l think
it's very tasty.

175
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:18,708
轮到你评论了，黛博拉
You just have to make
an adjustment, right, Debra?

176
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:24,988
不如再回味一次？
Kind of starts out with an aftertaste,
doesn't it?

177
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,661
真的有火鸡的味道
lt has an authentic
turkey flavor.

178
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,636
而且好处是吃了这顿饭后不会想要睡觉
And the good thing is you don't
fall asleep after this meal.

179
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:42,038
那是我仅剩的娱乐了
That's all l had left.

180
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:43,871
果冻！
lt's Jell￡-o!

181
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:45,968
嘘，别这样
Shh, don't do that.

182
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,013
我去开
l'll get it.

183
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,447
谁会这个时候来
Who could that be?

184
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,850
希望是死亡天使
Hopefully
the angel of death.

185
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:59,284
－ 巴龙？
－ 是的
￡- Barone?
￡- Yeah.

186
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,021
感恩节快乐！
红帽子饭店
Happy Thanksgiving
from the Red Bonnet lnn.

187
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,359
吃啊，吃啊，吃啊
Gobble, gobble, gobble.

188
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:08,657
这是什么？
What is this?

189
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:11,465
节日香肠大餐
A complete Holiday dinner
with all the trimmings.

190
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,701
他是慈悲的天使
lt's the angel of mercy!

191
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,133
肯定是搞错了
This must be a mistake.

192
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,701
你订的吗？弗兰克
You ordered this, Frank?

193
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:21,474
你为什么冤枉我？
Why do you assume it's me?

194
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,312
因为你总想要气死我
'Cause you're the one
who wants to kill me.

195
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,919
没错，但我确实没订
Okay, but l still
didn't order this.

196
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:32,081
谁订的？
Who did?

197
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:35,560
不是我，妈
你自己也不会相信是我
Not me, Ma.
This melts in your mouth.

198
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,670
本来应该送到街对面的
l would've left it
across the street,

199
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,703
但是这东西不能久放
but l can't leave
perishables.

200
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,238
－ 这里有没有一个叫雷巴龙的？
－ 不！
￡- ls there a Ray Barone over here?
￡- No!

201
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,921
噢～～～～见鬼
Oh boy!

202
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:11,286
拿去吧，你不会想要作证的。快走
Take this. You don't want
to have to testify. Go.

203
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,871
雷蒙德
Raymond.

204
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:25,639
吃啊，吃啊，吃啊
Gobble, gobble, gobble.

205
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:33,147
你订了这个？
You ordered this?

206
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:35,314
是啊，做为饭后点心
Yes, for a snack.

207
00:12:35,356 --> 00:12:37,483
到我家里去吃
For￡-￡- at my house￡-￡-

208
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:40,516
在这顿美味的大餐之后
later, later, after
this delicious meal.

209
00:12:40,561 --> 00:12:42,688
大家都来吧，一起吃
Come on, everybody,
let's dig in.

210
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,755
嘿，我们还没做祈祷呢
Hey, you know what?
We didn't say grace yet.

211
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,823
大家快来，一起做祷告
Huh? Come on, everybody,
grace time.

212
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:49,936
噢
Oh!

213
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:53,133
噢，主啊，保佑我们
Oh, Lord, bless us

215
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:58,544
还有您赐给我们的礼物

你知道……

Your friend, Ray Barone.

218
00:13:07,688 --> 00:13:10,555
我们开吃吧
Let's eat!

219
00:13:10,591 --> 00:13:13,321
哦天哪，我闻到的是不是栗子填料？
Oh God, is that
chestnut stuffing l smell?

220
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,590
你们到底怎么了？
What is wrong
with you people?

221
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,995
难道不能为别人想想吗？
Can't you stop thinking
of yourselves for one minute?

222
00:13:18,032 --> 00:13:19,499
－ 玉米松饼
－ 唔
￡- Corn muffins!
￡- Hmm.

223
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:22,263
知不知道这样会多伤你们母亲的心？
Do you know how much
this has hurt your mother?

224
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,362
我没说要现在吃，OK？
l wasn't gonna have
it now, okay?

225
00:13:24,405 --> 00:13:27,704
我不想伤害她，我理解她的感受
别碰我的火鸡！
l didn't want to hurt her.
l know how she feels. Hands off my bird!

226
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:30,904
我来处理这里
你去跟她谈谈
l'll take care of this.
You go in there and talk to her.

227
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:35,108
我现在不能跟她谈
她正不高兴着呢
l can't talk to her now.
She's all upset.

228
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:37,777
她正努力尝试着做一些改变
She's trying to do something
for herself for a change

229
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,752
你至少应该支持她
and the least you can do
is support her.

230
00:13:39,787 --> 00:13:41,254
是啊
Yes,

231
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:45,452
还有比雷蒙德更好的人选吗？
isn't it time you thought of someone
else beside Raymond?

232
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,483
谢谢，罗伯特
Yeah, thanks, Robert.

233
00:13:47,528 --> 00:13:50,019
你下巴上沾了东西
You got a little of my stuffing
on your chin there.

234
00:13:52,466 --> 00:13:54,331
嘿，你拿着那个去哪里？
Hey, where are you
going with that?

235
00:13:54,368 --> 00:13:56,802
不知道，也许送给流浪汉
l don't know.
Maybe l'll give it to the homeless.

236
00:13:56,837 --> 00:14:01,001
流浪汉！
他们吃得可比我们好
The homeless!
They're chowing down in some mission.

237
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:04,477
幸运的下流坯！
Lucky bastards!

238
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:12,341
听着，妈，你可以出来了
没事了
Listen, Ma, you can come back in now.
Everything's better now.

239
00:14:12,386 --> 00:14:14,786
黛博拉把坏的食物都拿走了
Debra took away
all the bad food.

240
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:20,021
我是指……饭店的食物
l mean, the restaurant food,
all right?

241
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,996
行了，快来吧
So come on, come on.
Come back in, come on.

242
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:27,489
来呀，妈
Come on back, Ma.
Come on.

243
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:30,469
嘿，这是酸奶酪蛋糕？
Hey, is this
your soy cheesecake?

244
00:14:30,504 --> 00:14:32,597
老天，看起来真不错
Boy, it looks great.

245
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:44,078
我现在还不想吃甜品
因为我要留着肚子吃饭
l don't want to eat that dessert now,
'cause that's gonna ruin the dinner.

246
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,746
妈，听着，关于订餐的事……
All right, Ma, look, look,
about the ordering￡-out thing￡-￡-

247
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,758
不，我知道，对不起
No, l know, l'm sorry.

248
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:53,020
什么？
What?

249
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,927
我知道你有多期待我的感恩节大餐
l know how much you love
my Thanksgiving dinner

250
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:58,830
我应该满足你的愿望的
and l should have
made it for you.

251
00:14:58,866 --> 00:15:01,426
不，你应该坚持你想做的
No, no, you've got
to stick to your thing￡-￡-

252
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:03,436
不，你是我的儿子
No, you're my son

253
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,597
而我却让你失望了
and l let you down.

254
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,971
对不起
l'm sorry.

255
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:18,609
知道吗，妈妈
You know what, Mom?

256
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:21,780
没关系
That's okay.

257
00:15:26,427 --> 00:15:29,089
没关系的
lt's okay.

258
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:33,022
别说了，别这样
All right, stop it.
Stop! Don't do that.

259
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:35,762
你把我套进去了，别给我下套子
You're letting me off the hook.
Don't let me off the hook.

260
00:15:35,803 --> 00:15:37,668
我不知道你在说什么
l don't know what
you're talking about.

261
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:39,968

你的意志力还真强啊

你到底想说还是想吃？
