1
00:00:04,147 --> 00:00:06,399
你打算全吃了？
Going to eat aII of that?

2
00:00:06,441 --> 00:00:08,944
我问了你要不要一片的
I asked you
if you wanted one.

3
00:00:08,985 --> 00:00:11,238
好吧，没事
AII right, fine.

4
00:00:11,238 --> 00:00:13,198
我刚想来着……
I was just
thinking that...

5
00:00:13,198 --> 00:00:15,784
我这会要么来点桔子，
要么……
right now I couId go
for some orange or...

6
00:00:15,826 --> 00:00:18,286
就嘿咻
some sex.

7
00:00:26,169 --> 00:00:28,338
谢谢
Thank you.

8
00:00:44,438 --> 00:00:46,356
你没事吧？
You aII right?

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,818
怎么了？
What's the matter?

10
00:00:52,821 --> 00:00:55,282
怎么了……吃气管里了还是怎么？
What... wrong pipe
or something?

11
00:01:10,005 --> 00:01:12,883
好了
There you go.

12
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,148
雷，你为什么不做点什么？
Ray, why didn't you
do something?!

13
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:17,025
什么？你想让我干什么？
What? What do you
want me to do?

14
00:01:17,066 --> 00:01:20,778
你就坐在那把电视开大！
You just sat there
and turned up the TV!

15
00:01:20,778 --> 00:01:23,740
干扰的声音太大了
T-there was a Iot of noise.

16
00:01:23,781 --> 00:01:25,700
哦――！
Oh--!

17
00:01:26,826 --> 00:01:29,245
紧急情况下你就这么反应的？！
Is that how you react
in an emergency?!

18
00:01:29,287 --> 00:01:31,205
这不是什么紧急情况
It wasn't an emergency.

19
00:01:31,247 --> 00:01:34,125
那东西出来了。在那
The thing came out.
There.

20
00:01:34,167 --> 00:01:36,628
想要我捡起来
以免你溜到？
Want me to pick it up
so you don't sIip on it?

21
00:01:38,212 --> 00:01:40,173
我要呛住了！
I was choking!

22
00:01:40,173 --> 00:01:43,176
你在咳嗽。
我是说，咳嗽又不是呛住
You were coughing.
I mean, coughing's not choking.

23
00:01:47,305 --> 00:01:50,224
好吧，对不起！
AII right, I'm sorry!

24
00:01:50,266 --> 00:01:52,894
我猜我是该多做点事
I guess I shouId have
done more.

25
00:01:52,936 --> 00:01:54,854
比一点不做多吗，雷？
More than nothing, Ray?

26
00:01:54,896 --> 00:01:59,108
哦，别这样。
你没事了，现在
Oh, come on.
You're okay, now.

27
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,236
你没必要生我气的，不是吗？
You don't got to be
mad at me, right?

28
00:02:01,277 --> 00:02:02,737
“爱斯基摩小鞋鞋”
''MukIuk''?

29
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,159
你知道，让你偶尔救我一次
难道也过分了吗？
You know, is it too much to ask
for you to save my Iife once in a whiIe?

30
00:02:08,201 --> 00:02:10,912
我是说，我想这是你
起码可以做的事吧
I mean, I think it's the Ieast
you couId do around here.

31
00:02:10,954 --> 00:02:13,873
嘿，别这样。
你知道你永远都可以指望我的
Hey, come on. You know
you can aIways count on me.

32
00:02:13,915 --> 00:02:17,001
- 哦，我能吗？什么时候？
- 有意义的时候
- Oh, I can? When?
- When it counts.

33
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,084
我是说，承认了吧。
紧急情况下你毫无用处
I mean, face it.
You're useIess in an emergency.

34
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,044
这不是紧急情况！
This wasn't
an emergency!

35
00:02:21,086 --> 00:02:23,755
你在咳嗽，然后“扑哇”！
You coughed,
you went, ''pwah!''

36
00:02:23,797 --> 00:02:25,799
不是吗？
这不是呛住
Right?
That's not choking.

37
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,052
好吧，那如果我真的呛住了，
你会怎么做？
Okay, and if I had been choking,
what wouId you have done?

38
00:02:29,094 --> 00:02:32,055
如果你真的呛住，
我肯定我会知道怎么做的
If you had reaIIy been choking,
I'm sure I wouId have known what to do.

39
00:02:32,097 --> 00:02:33,973
哦，你突然之间就开窍，
就像弹响指？
Oh, it wouId come to you,
just Iike that?

40
00:02:34,015 --> 00:02:36,142
是的，是的。
就像那个祖母，
Yeah, yeah.
Like the grandma

41
00:02:36,184 --> 00:02:40,063
突然就能把
压着她孙子的卡车举起来
who suddenIy can Iift the truck
off the grandson.

42
00:02:40,063 --> 00:02:43,066
好吧，祖母，
你会怎么做？
Okay, Grandma,
what wouId you do?

43
00:02:43,108 --> 00:02:46,486
- 我会做那个什么什么法的
- 是吗
- I wouId have done the maneuver thing.
- Yeah.

44
00:02:46,528 --> 00:02:48,363
怎么做来着？
How do you do
the maneuver thing?

45
00:02:48,405 --> 00:02:50,824
走到身后……
You-- get around
behind them...

46
00:02:50,824 --> 00:02:52,450
然后……
and you...

47
00:02:52,492 --> 00:02:54,661
听着，我比较擅长的是
Iisten, my speciaIty

48
00:02:54,703 --> 00:02:56,913
人工呼吸
happens to be
mouth-to-mouth.

49
00:02:58,206 --> 00:03:00,417
嘿
Hey.

50
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,502
罗伯特，你会海姆利希急救法吗？
Robert, can you do
the HeimIich maneuver?

51
00:03:02,544 --> 00:03:05,213
- 当然了，怎么了？什么事？
- 没事！
- Of course. Why? What's the probIem?
- Nothing!

52
00:03:05,255 --> 00:03:08,675
好了，放松，爱秀警官。
一切正常
AII right, reIax, Sergeant Show-off.
Everything's fine.

53
00:03:08,717 --> 00:03:11,261
- 是的，不是托雷的福
- 你呛住了？
- Yeah, no thanks to Ray.
- You were choking?

54
00:03:11,302 --> 00:03:12,804
- 不
- 是的，而他就那么坐着
- No.
- Yeah, and he just sat there.

55
00:03:12,846 --> 00:03:15,682
唔，遇上紧急情况，
他从来起不了作用
WeII he's never been
good in an emergency.

56
00:03:15,724 --> 00:03:18,768
除非紧急情况下你听不见电视，
那他就是你要找的人了
UnIess you can't hear a TV during
your emergency, then he's your man.

57
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,937
嘿，不是什么重大危机！
Hey, the chips
weren't down!

58
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:22,439
别担心，黛比，你是家里人，
Don't worry Deb,
you're famiIy.

59
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,940
- 我会照看你的
- 谢谢，罗伯特
- I'm watching out for you.
- Thanks, Robert.

60
00:03:23,982 --> 00:03:25,984
- 哦，拜托
- 知道吗，必要的时候，
- Oh, pIease.
- You know a person can perform

61
00:03:26,026 --> 00:03:28,945
- 自己也可以实施海姆利希急救的
- 是吗？
- the HeimIich maneuver on themseIves?
- Yeah?

62
00:03:28,987 --> 00:03:31,781
- 你最好教教我
- 我听到你的了
- You better show me how.
- I hear you.

63
00:03:31,823 --> 00:03:33,742
- 好的，用这张椅子……
- 是的
- Okay, you're going to use the chair...
- Yes.

64
00:03:33,783 --> 00:03:37,078
- 弯下腰……
- 我也听到你的了，是的
- just kind of over...
- I hear you too. Yeah.

65
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,039
嘿，罗伯特
Hey, Robert.

66
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,041
还有一种手法你也可以自己做
（手字开头的）
There's another maneuver
you can perform on yourseIf.

67
00:03:52,093 --> 00:03:55,347
- 嘿，妈
- 哈喽，雷蒙德。想吃点什么吗？
- Hey, Ma.
- HeIIo, Raymond. Want something to eat?

68
00:03:55,388 --> 00:03:59,309
- 不，我不饿
- 那就三明治
- No, I'm not hungry.
- You'II have a sandwich.

69
00:04:00,518 --> 00:04:02,604
我来帮你，拿来
Let me get that
for you, here.

70
00:04:11,154 --> 00:04:13,573
给
There you go.

71
00:04:13,615 --> 00:04:17,077
谢谢。
事实上，我刚拧上的
Thank you.
ActuaIIy, I had just cIosed it.

72
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:26,294
好吧，也许我要在这待会
AII right, maybe I'II just hang out here
for a IittIe whiIe.

73
00:04:27,295 --> 00:04:30,507
哦……
“芹菜宴”
Oh...
''CeIebrate with CeIery.''

74
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:37,138
- 谢谢
- 怎么了？她做了什么？
- Thanks.
- What's wrong? What did she do?

75
00:04:38,306 --> 00:04:40,558
没什么。她生我气了
Nothing.
She's mad at me.

76
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,186
她在……
吃桔子
She was...
eating an orange

77
00:04:43,228 --> 00:04:45,647
然后开始咳嗽……
and she started
coughing...

78
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:48,566
然后……可是并不是大不了的咳嗽，
你知道
and... but not big coughing,
you know?

79
00:04:48,608 --> 00:04:51,069
我猜我应该做点什么
或者别的什么
And I guess I shouId have
done something or something.

80
00:04:51,111 --> 00:04:52,737
她这么说？
Is that
what she said?

81
00:04:54,614 --> 00:04:56,241
不
No.

82
00:04:56,282 --> 00:04:59,202
她说她呛住了，
而我应该救她
She said she was choking
and I shouId have saved her Iife.

83
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:06,835
唔，你知道，雷蒙德，
我一向觉得黛比拉对人苛刻
WeII, you know, Raymond, I have
aIways found Debra to be very demanding.

84
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:10,046
你知道，所以……
You know, so...

85
00:05:10,046 --> 00:05:12,799
我并不知道那种样子的状况下，
I didn't know the exact
right thing to do

86
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:15,093
我到底应该怎么做
at that particuIar moment.

87
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,053
我还是……
I'm stiII...

88
00:05:17,095 --> 00:05:18,888
你知道，是不是？
you know, right?

89
00:05:20,473 --> 00:05:23,685
- 什么，亲爱的？
- 唔，比如说，在紧急情况下――
- What, dear?
- WeII Iike, in an emergency situation--

90
00:05:23,727 --> 00:05:25,937
你还是想要我在的，是不是？
You'd stiII
want me around, right?

91
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:28,648
什么样的紧急情况？
What kind of emergency?

92
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:32,152
我不知道。
我把你从什么里救出来――
I don't know.
I save you from something--

93
00:05:32,193 --> 00:05:34,112
洪水，大火
a fIood, a fire.

94
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:39,826
- 还有别的人在吗？
- 哦，行了，妈！
- Are there other peopIe around?
- Oh, come on, Ma!

95
00:05:39,868 --> 00:05:42,120
只是在有压力的情况下
做这种事，
It's just that when it comes
to acting under pressure,

96
00:05:42,162 --> 00:05:44,581
你不是那个……
you're not exactIy...

97
00:05:44,581 --> 00:05:46,708
不过罗伯特恰好很在行
but Robert happens to be
very capabIe.

98
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,794
是的，哦是的，可那时他的工作。
他受过训练
Yeah, oh yeah, but that's his job.
He's had training.

99
00:05:49,836 --> 00:05:53,214
- 即便是受训之前
- 那假设罗伯特不在
- Even before the training.
- Let's say Robert's not here.

100
00:05:53,256 --> 00:05:56,843
他正在给小猫做心肺复苏，好吗？
He's giving CPR
to a kitten, okay?

101
00:05:57,844 --> 00:05:59,888
那样……那时候你就想要我了
Then... then
you want me.

102
00:06:01,097 --> 00:06:02,891
能叫你爸来吗？
Is your father
avaiIabIe?

103
00:06:02,932 --> 00:06:04,976
什么？
What?

104
00:06:05,018 --> 00:06:08,146
随便你怎么说他，
不过到了这种情形下，
Say what you wiII about him, but when
it comes to something Iike this,

105
00:06:08,188 --> 00:06:10,106
他的表现让人印象深刻
he can be very
impressive.

106
00:06:10,148 --> 00:06:13,693
我是说，他是个斗士。
内心燃烧着一团大火
I mean, his a fighter.
He's got that inner rage.

107
00:06:13,735 --> 00:06:16,863
事实上，他总是在找借口烧烧
ActuaIIy, he's just Iooking
for an excuse to use it.

108
00:06:16,905 --> 00:06:18,823
你喜欢？
And you Iike that?

109
00:06:18,865 --> 00:06:21,993
不是你老抱怨他
不够善解人意吗？
You're the one aIways compIaining
that he isn't sensitive enough.

110
00:06:22,035 --> 00:06:23,995
可你不会想要善解人意的
But you just don't
want sensitive.

111
00:06:23,995 --> 00:06:27,874
善解人意可吓不走窃贼，
或者偷窥狂
Sensitive doesn't scare off a burgIar,
or a peeping Tom.

112
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:31,461
这屋里也会有这种问题吗？
That's a big probIem
around here, is it?

113
00:06:34,756 --> 00:06:38,343
做个破三明治到底要多久？
How Iong does it take
to make a friggin' sandwich?

114
00:06:39,552 --> 00:06:43,014
爱是赶不了工的，弗兰克
You can't rush the Iove,
Frank.

115
00:06:43,056 --> 00:06:45,850
他不是唯一的斗士。
好不好，妈？我也是硬汉
He's not the onIy fighter.
Okay, Ma? I'm tough too.

116
00:06:45,892 --> 00:06:47,811
椅子
Chair.

117
00:06:47,852 --> 00:06:50,105
危急的时候才能显出我强悍
I'm tough
when the chips are down.

118
00:06:50,146 --> 00:06:53,650
你说什么呢？
玛丽，薯片
What are you taIking about?
Marie, chips?

119
00:06:53,692 --> 00:06:55,276
我在讲我强悍
I'm taIking
that I'm tough.

120
00:06:55,318 --> 00:06:58,071
难以抗拒
Tough to resist.

121
00:06:58,113 --> 00:07:00,740
是啊，你强悍
Yeah, you're tough.

122
00:07:00,782 --> 00:07:02,409
是吗，有什么意见？
Yeah, what of it?

123
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,411
好吧，来
AII right, Iet's go.

124
00:07:04,452 --> 00:07:07,622
- 干什么？
- 来吧，厉害人物！扳手腕！
- What?
- Come on, big shot! Arm wrestIe!

125
00:07:07,664 --> 00:07:09,582
哦，弗兰克，别把肘子放桌上
Oh, Frank, take your eIbow
off the tabIe.

126
00:07:09,624 --> 00:07:11,835
放松，你可以跟赢的人走
ReIax, you can have winners.

127
00:07:11,876 --> 00:07:14,337
快点，我等着呢，“萨蒂”
Come on,
I'm waiting, ''Sadie.''

128
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:16,381
我才不跟你扳手腕呢，好吗？
你个疯子
I'm not arm wrestIing you, okay?
You maniac.

129
00:07:16,423 --> 00:07:18,216
我不需要证明任何事
I don't have anything
to prove.

130
00:07:18,216 --> 00:07:21,970
唔，那么这证明了一些事，
不是吗？
WeII, then that proves
something, doesn't it?

131
00:07:24,806 --> 00:07:27,392
别听他的。
别听他的
Don't Iisten to him.
Don't Iisten to him.

132
00:07:27,434 --> 00:07:29,686
你是个可爱的男孩，
这就是你该做的
You're a sweet boy
and that's what you do.

133
00:07:29,728 --> 00:07:32,355
- 我不可爱！
- 好的，别难过
- I'm not sweet!
- AII right, don't get upset.

134
00:07:32,397 --> 00:07:35,608
我想说的是，
你很可爱，不过你也有男子气
What I meant to say is that
you're sweet, but you're aIso manIy.

135
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:39,070
你是个强壮、阳刚的男人
You're a strapping,
viriIe man.

136
00:07:39,112 --> 00:07:41,489
妈妈说的
Said his mommy.

137
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:44,701
我不知是他的妈妈，弗兰克
I'm not onIy
his mommy, Frank.

138
00:07:44,743 --> 00:07:46,453
我同时是个女人
I'm aIso a woman.

139
00:07:46,494 --> 00:07:47,912
哦上帝
Oh God.

140
00:07:49,914 --> 00:07:51,833
你一直是这样子的
And you aIways
do things Iike that.

141
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,626
我记得你老是跟人打架
I remember you getting
into fights aII the time.

142
00:07:53,668 --> 00:07:57,130
你是说被人修理吧。
掀裤子可不是打架
Getting picked on, you mean.
A wedgie is not a fight.

143
00:07:57,172 --> 00:08:02,010
看，还记得那个被你揍了的
老是找你茬的男孩吗？
Look, you remember that boy who
was bothering you and you waIIoped him?

144
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:05,430
哦，是的。没错。
罗伯特的朋友，阿尔伯特・戈梅兹
Oh, yeah. That's right.
Robert's friend AIbert Gomez.

145
00:08:05,472 --> 00:08:08,433
这个大块头多大了？10岁？！
How oId was
this bruiser? 10?!

146
00:08:08,475 --> 00:08:11,394
我告诉你吧，爸，
是我10岁，好吗？
For your information, Dad,
I was 10, okay?

147
00:08:11,394 --> 00:08:13,730
他12岁……半了
He was 1 2...
and a haIf.

148
00:08:13,772 --> 00:08:16,066
哦――哦――哦
Oo-oo-ooh.

149
00:08:16,107 --> 00:08:17,734
他叫我“大鼻子巴伦”
He caIIed me
''Big Nose Barone,''

150
00:08:17,734 --> 00:08:20,362
然后我说……“别说了”。
他说：
and I said... ''Stop.''
He said,

151
00:08:20,403 --> 00:08:24,949
“好吧，大鼻伦。”
我知道那什么意思。是的
''Okay, B.N.B.''
I knew what that meant. Yeah.

152
00:08:24,991 --> 00:08:26,576
所以我一拳打在他肚子上
So I punched him
in the stomach

153
00:08:26,618 --> 00:08:28,536
然后他蹲下了，
像一袋子门把手
and he went down
Iike a sack of doorknobs.

154
00:08:28,578 --> 00:08:30,830
是的，不再有“大鼻子巴伦”了
Yeah, it wasn't
''Big Nose Barone'' anymore.

155
00:08:30,872 --> 00:08:33,667
而是“大拳头”
It was ''Superpunch.''

156
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,627
而且你不是大鼻子，亲爱的
And you don't have
a big nose, dear.

157
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:38,254
配你的脸好极了
It's perfect
for your face.

158
00:08:39,631 --> 00:08:42,425
- 配两张脸最合适
- 哦行了！
- It's perfect for two faces.
- Oh stop it!

159
00:08:42,467 --> 00:08:46,054
好吧，爸！
说够了没有？
AII right, Dad!
Knock it off!

160
00:08:46,096 --> 00:08:49,391
- 别激动，“大拳头”
- 是的
- Easy there, ''Superpunch.''
- Yeah.

161
00:08:49,432 --> 00:08:52,268
他们怎么叫你的，哈？
大肚皮？
What'd they caII you, huh?
Superpaunch?

162
00:08:53,436 --> 00:08:55,689
我就在着呢
I'm right here.

163
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,982
- 好了，来吧
- 别这样，我不喜欢！
- AII right, Iet's go.
- Come on, I don't Iike that!

164
00:08:58,024 --> 00:09:00,860
停下！
别在我的鸡蛋沙拉上
Stop it!
And not on my egg saIad.

165
00:09:00,902 --> 00:09:02,987
- 准备……
- 开始
- Ready...
- Go.

166
00:09:05,615 --> 00:09:07,826
我跟你玩呢
I'm just pIaying
with you.

167
00:09:07,867 --> 00:09:10,161
是吗，是吗，当然
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.

168
00:09:10,203 --> 00:09:12,956
3……2 ……
Three... two...

169
00:09:12,998 --> 00:09:14,666
1！
One!

170
00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:19,337
你以为呢，孩子？！
What did you expect, kid?!

171
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:21,339
这是换台的手！
It's my TV arm!

172
00:09:24,676 --> 00:09:26,261
你太欺负人了，弗兰克！
You're a buIIy,
Frank!

173
00:09:26,302 --> 00:09:29,472
来吧，三轮两胜。
哦，我的手肘！
Come on, two out of three.
Ow, my funny bone!

174
00:09:29,514 --> 00:09:32,142
- 看你做的好事！他受伤了！
- 哦，痛死我了！
- See what you did! He's hurt!
- Oh, it's tingIing!

175
00:09:32,183 --> 00:09:34,644
我要把他的三明治也吃掉！
I'II take his sandwich too!

176
00:09:40,109 --> 00:09:44,322
嘿，尼莫。
你知道有人呛住的话怎么做吗？
Hey, Nemo. Do you know
what to do if somebody's choking?

177
00:09:44,364 --> 00:09:46,783
换掉特餐
Change the speciaI.

178
00:09:48,826 --> 00:09:51,037
好吧，谢谢
Yeah, thanks.

179
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:52,997
- 嘿，雷，你好吗？
- 嘿
- Hey, Ray, how's it going?
- Hey.

180
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:55,166
嘿，你迟到了。
我们点了小辣椒披萨
Hey, you were Iate.
We ordered pizza with jaIapenos.

181
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,710
- 将就吃点吧
- 好吧，好吧
- DeaI with it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

182
00:09:57,752 --> 00:10:00,171
怎么，你现在上哪都穿制服了？
What, you wear the uniform
everywhere now?

183
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:06,469
我在午休。
他们让穿这个上班的
I'm on a Iunch break.
They make us wear these for work.

184
00:10:08,012 --> 00:10:10,515
- 哈
- 你怎么了？
- Huh.
- What's with you?

185
00:10:10,557 --> 00:10:12,517
没什么
Nothing.

186
00:10:14,561 --> 00:10:16,062
你是个坏兄弟
You're a bad brother.

187
00:10:16,104 --> 00:10:17,772
嘿！
Hey!

188
00:10:17,814 --> 00:10:19,732
别这么说
Don't say that.

189
00:10:19,774 --> 00:10:22,694
兄弟师生来的朋友
A brother is a friend
given by nature.

190
00:10:24,737 --> 00:10:28,783
雷蒙德生我气因为我教黛比拉
做海姆利希急救法
Raymond's mad at me because
I showed Debra the HeimIich maneuver.

191
00:10:28,825 --> 00:10:30,910
这是什么委婉说法吗？
Is that a euphemism?

192
00:10:32,745 --> 00:10:35,707
你不能跑到我家
上我妻子面前故意出我的丑
You don't come into my house and try
to show me up in front of my wife.

193
00:10:35,748 --> 00:10:37,250
他让她差点呛死
He Iet her aImost
choke to death.

194
00:10:37,292 --> 00:10:38,543
唔，这可不对
WeII that's not right.

195
00:10:38,585 --> 00:10:40,503
她只是吃桔子咳了
She was coughing
on a piece of fruit!

196
00:10:40,545 --> 00:10:43,339
多亏了这位“男童子军”，
现在她认为我是个没用的窝囊废
OnIy thanks to this ''boy scout,''
she thinks I'm useIess now.

197
00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:46,217
我宁可作男童子军，
而不是女童子军
I'd rather be a boy scout
than a girI scout.

198
00:10:47,302 --> 00:10:49,220
你什么意思？
What are you saying?

199
00:10:49,262 --> 00:10:52,265
我的意思是……
我会带上一盒子薄荷糖，小可爱
I'm saying... I'II take
a box of thin mints, sweetie.

200
00:10:52,307 --> 00:10:54,559
有意思
That's funny.

201
00:10:54,601 --> 00:10:58,146
- 什么意思？
- 想喝点什么，雷？
- What does that mean?
- What do you want to drink, Ray?

202
00:10:58,188 --> 00:11:00,940
- 我要一杯可乐
- 想扳手腕赢着喝吗？
- I'II have a coke.
- You want to arm wrestIe for it?

203
00:11:04,277 --> 00:11:06,321
说得好。说得太好了
That's good. That is good.

204
00:11:06,362 --> 00:11:08,198
上班的时候爸呼我了
Dad had me paged
at work.

205
00:11:10,617 --> 00:11:13,328
他有没有告诉你他作弊了？
他把整个身体全压上了
Did he teII you that he cheated?
He was using his whoIe body.

206
00:11:13,328 --> 00:11:16,623
不用说还有他的口臭
Not to mention
his breath.

207
00:11:16,664 --> 00:11:19,375
你爸是个真正的男人。
他想办法做成事
Your dad's a reaI man. He does
what it takes to get the job done.

208
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:21,294
我做成事了
I get the job done.

209
00:11:21,336 --> 00:11:24,172
哦，我们得到的消息可不大一样
Oh, we're getting
some confIicting reports.

210
00:11:24,214 --> 00:11:27,258
显然你比一个虚弱的老头子更虚
ApparentIy you're weaker
than a feebIe oId geezer

211
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,053
你还差点让桔子
把新娘子给带走了
and you aImost Iost your bride
to an orange.

212
00:11:30,094 --> 00:11:32,013
- 好了，闭嘴吧
- 别这样，雷！
- AII right, just shut up.
- Come on, Ray!

213
00:11:32,055 --> 00:11:34,307
我们的身上长体毛是有原因的
Our bodies are covered
with hair for a reason.

214
00:11:34,349 --> 00:11:37,644
让和你同桌吃饭的人恶心？
To nauseate
your feIIow diners?

215
00:11:37,685 --> 00:11:39,604
因为我们该有个男人样
Because we're
supposed to be men.

216
00:11:39,646 --> 00:11:41,314
另外，雷，作为你朋友，
And Ray, as your friend,

217
00:11:41,356 --> 00:11:44,567
我只能坦诚地说，
除非你能供养和保护你的女人，
I can honestIy say, unIess you can
provide for and protect your woman,

218
00:11:44,609 --> 00:11:47,487
不然就让开让我试试
you shouId get out of the way
and give me a shot.

219
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:49,030
好了！
AII right!

220
00:11:49,072 --> 00:11:51,533
看，得了吧，
黛比拉绝不会看上你的
Look, come on, Debra
wouId never go for you.

221
00:11:51,574 --> 00:11:53,076
哦，那她会看上谁，你吗？
Oh, and who wouId she
go for, you?

222
00:11:53,117 --> 00:11:54,619
我从未对此有所怀疑
I don't even think
that's a question.

223
00:11:54,661 --> 00:11:56,621
好了，你们俩都闭嘴行不行？
AII right,
wouId you both shut up?

224
00:11:56,663 --> 00:11:59,791
我是说真的。
我腿比你长
I'm serious.
My Iegs are taIIer than you.

225
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,212
哦是吗？
你是真男人？
Oh yeah?
You're a reaI man?

226
00:12:04,254 --> 00:12:07,507
看看这个。我几个小时前刚刮的
Check this out.
I shaved an hour ago.

227
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:10,093
又是体毛。
你还有别的吗？
Again with the hair.
What eIse you got?

228
00:12:10,134 --> 00:12:12,679
好吧，黛比拉会先选谁，
我还是贾尼？
AII right, who wouId Debra
pick first, me or Gianni?

229
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,932
- 喔啊！
- 嘿，你们怎么知道没我的份？
- Whoa!
- Hey, I'm not necessariIy out of this.

230
00:12:15,974 --> 00:12:18,560
如果雷蒙德不在了，作为兄长，
我娶她。圣经上写的
If Raymond goes, I'm the brother.
I get her. It's in the BibIe.

231
00:12:18,601 --> 00:12:20,520
喔啊！喔啊！
Whoa! Whoa!

232
00:12:20,562 --> 00:12:23,314
- 喔啊！
- 好了，好了，看！
- Whoa!
- Okay, aII right, Iook!

233
00:12:23,356 --> 00:12:26,568
大家，能不能让雷蒙德静静？
他显然很敏感
WiII everybody just Ieave Raymond
aIone? He's obviousIy sensitive.

234
00:12:26,609 --> 00:12:28,528
到了天黑以后，
And at the end
of the day,

235
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,614
女人们自然高兴了
that's what
the Iadies Iike.

236
00:12:31,656 --> 00:12:34,617
安迪，等天黑以后，
你只能用嘴伺候你的女人
Andy, at the end the day,
you have to bIow up your Iady.

237
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,339
我在女人的事上很好
I do fine
with the women.

238
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:50,425
她们觉得我抱着舒服又可爱
They find me
cuddIy and cute.

239
00:12:50,466 --> 00:12:53,595
而她们一戳我肚脐，我就――
And when the poke me
in the beIIy, I go--

240
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:01,644
你想什么呢？
你以为我瞎编的么？
What'd you think?
That I wasn't going to back it up?

241
00:13:01,686 --> 00:13:04,105
别听他们的，雷蒙德！
Don't Iisten to them,
Raymond!

242
00:13:04,147 --> 00:13:06,065
你不是废物
You are not useIess.

243
00:13:06,107 --> 00:13:07,859
你我这样的男人是在挑战
Guys Iike us don't have
to get caught up

244
00:13:07,859 --> 00:13:11,237
一成不变的性格角色，
那些个男人必须照顾女人的狗屁
in stereotypicaI gender roIes where
the man has to take care of the woman.

245
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,908
是的，好吧。谢谢，安迪，
不过把你我做比较
Yeah, okay. Thank you, Andy,
but you're reaIIy not heIping me

246
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:17,410
不是帮助我的办法，好吗？
with the me-to-you
comparison, okay?

247
00:13:17,452 --> 00:13:19,412
我不想被照顾
I don't want to be
taken care of.

248
00:13:20,705 --> 00:13:22,207
你笑什么？
What are you Iaughing at?

249
00:13:22,248 --> 00:13:24,209
我刚注意到你话里的讽刺意味
I'm just noting the irony
in your statement

250
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,211
考虑到
in the Iight of the fact

251
00:13:26,211 --> 00:13:28,713
你就住在你妈街对面的事实
that you Iive across the street
from your mother.

252
00:13:28,755 --> 00:13:31,716
你说什么呢？
你在那住了35年了！
What are you taIking about?!
You Iived there for 35 years!

253
00:13:31,758 --> 00:13:34,010
住过！住过！
过去式！
Lived! Lived!
Past tense!

254
00:13:34,052 --> 00:13:36,304
我现在住的离他们几哩外了
I'm now miIes away
from them.

255
00:13:36,346 --> 00:13:39,516
1.38哩
1.38 miIes.

256
00:13:41,142 --> 00:13:44,020
是啊，是啊。我应该听取你的建议
Yeah, yeah. You're the person
I shouId be taking advice from.

257
00:13:44,062 --> 00:13:46,064
看，我只是想帮帮你
Look, we're just trying
to heIp you out here,

258
00:13:46,105 --> 00:13:48,107
可你也得拿出点像样的东西
but you got to bring
something to the tabIe.

259
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:50,652
现在，安迪，他可爱又软软
Now Andy, he's cute
and squishabIe.

260
00:13:50,693 --> 00:13:52,195
贾尼多毛又吓人
Gianni is hairy
and scary.

261
00:13:52,237 --> 00:13:56,032
而我则碰巧是完美的……混合
And I happen to be
the perfect... amaIgam.

262
00:13:56,074 --> 00:13:58,034
你听到了，混合
You heard me, amaIgam.

263
00:14:02,121 --> 00:14:04,207
你呢？你什么都不是
You? You're neither
here nor there.

264
00:14:04,249 --> 00:14:07,085
是啊，好吧，看。
我没必要在你们这些白痴面前为自己辩护
Yeah, okay, Iook. I don't have
to defend myseIf to you idiots!

265
00:14:07,085 --> 00:14:09,045
我不是完美的男人，
可是我――
I'm not the perfect man,
but I--

266
00:14:09,087 --> 00:14:12,006
我很确信我在座唯一有女人的人！
I'm pretty sure I'm the onIy one
sitting here who has a woman!

267
00:14:12,048 --> 00:14:14,008
目前是
For now.

268
00:14:15,552 --> 00:14:18,471
哦，是。
啊哈！
Oh, right.
A-ha!

269
00:14:18,471 --> 00:14:21,641
非常有趣，
“长毛怪”
Very funny,
''Cousin Itt.''

270
00:14:21,683 --> 00:14:24,686
黛比拉碰巧认为我的毛发
Debra happens to Iike the fact that
I have just the right amount of hair

271
00:14:24,727 --> 00:14:26,938
数量上和位置上都刚刚好
in just the right
amount of pIaces.

272
00:14:26,938 --> 00:14:29,524
哦，我相信她晕过去以前，
Oh, I'm sure that was
a comforting Iast thought

273
00:14:29,566 --> 00:14:31,526
这种想法一定让她很安慰
before she bIacked out.

274
00:14:33,194 --> 00:14:35,780
“雷蒙德的身体真光滑。
''Raymond's body's
so smooth.

275
00:14:35,822 --> 00:14:38,575
就像只没毛的……猫“
Like a hairIess... cat.''

276
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:45,290
是的，再见。
再见了
Yeah, bye.
Bye bye.

277
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:48,376
嘿，别这样！你去哪？
披萨就上了
Hey, come on! Where you going?
The pizza's coming.

278
00:14:48,418 --> 00:14:51,921
是吗，我要回我妻子那，好吗？
我妻子，好吗？
Yeah, I'm going home to my wife, okay?
My wife, aII right?!

279
00:14:51,963 --> 00:14:53,715
我家里一切都好得很！
And everything is fine
in my house!

280
00:14:53,756 --> 00:14:55,633
她碰巧只需要我一个男人
I happen to be
aII the man she needs!

281
00:14:57,677 --> 00:15:00,096
任何时间，任何地点
Anytime,
anywhere.

282
00:15:07,145 --> 00:15:10,106
嘿，“快快瘦”。
哦，把袋子给我。来
Hey there, ''SIim-fast.''
Oh, give me those bags. Here.

283
00:15:10,148 --> 00:15:11,816
- 没事的，我来就行
- 不，让我来
- It's okay, I got them.
- No, Iet me take them.

284
00:15:11,858 --> 00:15:14,194
- 我行的
- 不，我想拿。放哪？
- I got it.
- No, I want them. Where do they go?

285
00:15:14,235 --> 00:15:16,196
就这
Right here.

286
00:15:18,114 --> 00:15:20,366
好了，还有什么事？
AII right,
anything eIse?

287
00:15:20,408 --> 00:15:21,743
没了。
你干什么？
No.
What are you doing?

288
00:15:21,784 --> 00:15:24,662
只是打点些事情
Just taking care
of a few things.

289
00:15:24,662 --> 00:15:27,582
我检查了烟火警报器、换了灯泡
I checked the smoke detectors.
I changed a Iight buIb.

290
00:15:27,624 --> 00:15:30,168
拍死只虫子。
呃――
Squashed a bug.
Uh...

291
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:33,880
是的――披呀的一生。
我眉毛都没皱一下
yeah... made a crackIing noise.
Didn't bother me.

292
00:15:33,922 --> 00:15:35,882
- 还有什么事？车里还有袋子吗？
- 哈啊
- What eIse? Any bags Ieft in the car?
- Huh-uh.

293
00:15:35,924 --> 00:15:37,800
嘿，车开得怎么样？
Hey, how's the car driving?

294
00:15:37,842 --> 00:15:39,844
要不要我打开引擎盖
检查下……
You want me to pop the hood
and check under the, uh...

295
00:15:39,886 --> 00:15:41,846
那下面？
thing?

296
00:15:44,098 --> 00:15:47,644
不，车子很好。
番茄酱呢？
No, the car is reaIIy fine.
Where's the ketchup?

297
00:15:47,685 --> 00:15:50,563
哦，拜托！
我知道我买了番茄酱的
Oh, come on!
I know I bought ketchup.

298
00:15:50,563 --> 00:15:52,524
准是他们没放袋子里
I bet they didn't
put it in the bag.

299
00:15:52,565 --> 00:15:54,692
这帮狗娘养的。
我这就过去！
Those sons of bitches.
I'm going to go down there!

300
00:15:54,734 --> 00:15:55,902
喔啊，喔啊，喔啊
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

301
00:15:55,944 --> 00:15:58,196
- 等等，找到了
- 找到了？那就好
- Wait, found it.
- You got it? AII right.

302
00:15:58,238 --> 00:16:01,658
要不然我这就过去，
拿着两包回来
'Cause I'd go down there
and come back with two ketchups.

303
00:16:04,828 --> 00:16:07,288
- 你没事吧？
- 是的，一切正常
- You okay?
- Yeah, everything's cooI.

304
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,082
我只是打理事情
Just taking care of things.

305
00:16:09,123 --> 00:16:11,209
- 你干什么？
- 把凳子放回去
- What are you doing?
- Just going to put the stooI back.

306
00:16:11,251 --> 00:16:12,669
- 哦不，我来放

- Oh no, I'II take it.
- I got it, honey.

307
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,295
- 不，你不用拿的
- 噢！
- No, you don't have to carry it.
- Ow!

308
00:16:14,337 --> 00:16:16,047
- 怎么了？
- 木刺
- What?
- SpIinter.

309
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:18,383
哦，对不起
Oh, I'm sorry.

310
00:16:19,384 --> 00:16:21,302
木刺。
不，我能弄
SpIinter.
No, I can do that.

311
00:16:21,344 --> 00:16:23,847
- 你这是怎么了？
- 你被刺了。我来搞定
- What's the matter with you?
- You've got a spIinter. I'm on it.

312
00:16:23,888 --> 00:16:25,515
- 没关系，我自己能弄
- 不，让我来！
- That's okay, I can get it out.
- No, Iet me!

313
00:16:25,557 --> 00:16:28,226
别担心。
一切都在控制中。我在这
Don't worry.
Everything's under controI. I'm here.

314
00:16:28,268 --> 00:16:30,854
- 镊子，镊子在哪？
- 那边抽屉里
- Tweezers, where are they?
- They're in the drawer over there.

315
00:16:30,895 --> 00:16:33,147

- Just caIm down!

316
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:34,941
镊子在哪？
Where are

317
00:16:34,983 --> 00:16:37,610
- 在那呢，就在那

不！我碰巧擅长这个！
No! I happen to be

322
00:16:46,327 --> 00:16:48,496
求你了，停下好不好？
停下！快停下！

324
00:16:50,498 --> 00:16:53,710
危急情况出现了！

325
00:16:53,751 --> 00:16:56,129
- 转过来！停下来行不行？！

326
00:16:56,171 --> 00:16:59,174
- 出大事了！
- 别过来！
- Chips are down!
- Get away from me!

327
00:16:59,215 --> 00:17:02,051

嘿，雷，看着！

Hey, Ray, Iook!

328
00:17:02,093 --> 00:17:05,054
亲爱的……亲爱的……
Honey... honey...

329
00:17:06,931 --> 00:17:08,892
我――怎么了，你想把我的刺拔出来
I-- what, you want to prove
that you're a man

330
00:17:08,933 --> 00:17:10,393
好证明你是男人？！

my spIinter out?!

331
00:17:10,393 --> 00:17:11,811
承认吧……
Just admit it...

332
00:17:11,853 --> 00:17:13,396
你需要我！

你干什么？！
Ray, get off of me!
What are you doing?!

335
00:17:17,734 --> 00:17:19,903

- You stop it!
- No, you stop it!

342
00:17:36,503 --> 00:17:38,755
- 亲爱的，别这样！
-别动！把镊子给我！
- Honey, come on!
- Stop it! Give me the tweezers!

343
00:17:38,796 --> 00:17:41,049
- 别动！别动！
- 亲爱的……
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Honey...

344
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,009
不是这只手！
It's the wrong hand!

345
00:17:44,511 --> 00:17:46,763
别乱动了！
你搞得我都不知道怎么办了！
Stop struggIing!
You've got me aII turned around!

346
00:17:46,804 --> 00:17:48,598
放松点
Just reIax.

347
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,975
- 你跪在我肋骨上了！
- 没事的
- Your knee is in my rib!
- It's okay.

348
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,312
就停一下！
就一会！
Just stop it for a minute!
Just one minute!

349
00:17:54,354 --> 00:17:56,022
怎么了？
What?

350
00:17:56,064 --> 00:17:57,815
看……
Look...

351
00:17:57,857 --> 00:17:59,776
我知道你的意图
I know what
you're trying to do

352
00:17:59,817 --> 00:18:02,070
可你用不着那么做
but you don't
have to do it.

353
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:05,031
我是说，
我想我昨天反应过度了
I mean, I think
I overreacted yesterday.

354
00:18:05,073 --> 00:18:09,160
- 我抱歉如果我那么做了，亲爱的
- 不……不，你没有
- And I'm sorry if I did, honey.
- No... no, you didn't.

355
00:18:10,411 --> 00:18:12,831
我应该做点什么的。
我搞得一团糟
I shouId have done something.
I screwed up.

356
00:18:12,872 --> 00:18:14,791
不，你没有。
不――
No, you didn't.
No--

357
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:17,752
亲爱的，我认为你是个很好的丈夫
honey, I think you're
a wonderfuI husband.

358
00:18:17,794 --> 00:18:19,712
不，你没有
No, you don't.

359
00:18:19,754 --> 00:18:21,464
不，我有！
No, yes!

360
00:18:21,506 --> 00:18:24,759
我是那样想的。
你是个好男人
I do.
You're a good man.

361
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:27,095
哼？
Hmmm?

362
00:18:27,136 --> 00:18:29,472
嗯哼――
过来
Umph--
come here.

363
00:18:31,224 --> 00:18:35,061
我能起来了吗？
Can I get up now?

364
00:18:37,272 --> 00:18:39,440
- 我必须把那个弄出来！
- 哦，亲爱的，求你了！
- I got to get that spIinter out!
- Oh, honey, pIease!
