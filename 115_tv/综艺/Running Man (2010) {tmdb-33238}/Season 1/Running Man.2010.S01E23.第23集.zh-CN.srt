1
00:00:17,913 --> 00:00:19,147
No hello?

2
00:00:19,148 --> 00:00:20,649
Hi.

3
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:31,559
This is all just
an elaborate plan

4
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,161
to get me alone, isn't it?

5
00:00:33,162 --> 00:00:35,397
You found me out.
(wry chuckle)

6
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,633
We're redoing the floors.

7
00:00:38,634 --> 00:00:40,135
It's her.

8
00:00:51,347 --> 00:00:52,947
(thunder crashes)

9
00:01:07,096 --> 00:01:10,398
You'll have to turn off
cell phones and beepers.

10
00:01:10,399 --> 00:01:11,800
They expect me on call.

11
00:01:11,801 --> 00:01:13,735
We'll be 20 minutes
at the most.

12
00:01:18,074 --> 00:01:21,910
I can't believe
we're doing this.

13
00:01:21,911 --> 00:01:24,245
We could still turn back.

14
00:01:25,147 --> 00:01:26,948
I love you.

15
00:01:31,487 --> 00:01:33,054
We're redoing the floors.

16
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:41,096
Okay, I'll start.

17
00:01:41,097 --> 00:01:44,632
Due to agency-wide
budget cuts, the FBI has

18
00:01:44,633 --> 00:01:46,167
to be very selective

19
00:01:46,168 --> 00:01:47,902
with its Federal Witness
Protection monies.

20
00:01:47,903 --> 00:01:48,903
You have our proffer.

21
00:01:48,904 --> 00:01:52,574
Yes. Uh, very elegantly put.

22
00:01:52,575 --> 00:01:55,677
Unfortunately, for my purposes,

23
00:01:55,678 --> 00:01:57,979
I'll need more specificity. 
Jack Arkins.

24
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,514
is part of a joint task force

25
00:01:59,515 --> 00:02:01,850
with the Cook County
Sheriff's Office.

26
00:02:01,851 --> 00:02:03,852
He witnessed and was pressured

27
00:02:03,853 --> 00:02:05,820
to participate
in illegal activities

28
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:07,756
by other members
of his drug task force.

29
00:02:07,757 --> 00:02:09,858
Some of these activities
crossed state lines.

30
00:02:09,859 --> 00:02:11,459
He is willing to help the FBI

31
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,194
bring these corrupt cops
to justice...

32
00:02:13,195 --> 00:02:15,497
And save his own ass.

33
00:02:15,498 --> 00:02:17,332
Okay, maybe this was a mistake.

34
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,167
All right, all right.

35
00:02:19,168 --> 00:02:20,568
I understand

36
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:22,704
Internal Affairs is
investigating this task force.

37
00:02:22,705 --> 00:02:24,973
Why don't I just
let them do their work?

38
00:02:24,974 --> 00:02:27,008
Because the state's attorney
wants to be reelected.

39
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:28,309
He's not gonna let
an investigation

40
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,978
of his pet project
become an embarrassment.

41
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:32,647
And what about the people
in this room who could benefit

42
00:02:32,648 --> 00:02:35,550
from such an embarrassment?

43
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:38,419
I'll step out.

44
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,890
No. The Arkins came to you;
it's your case.

45
00:02:43,726 --> 00:02:45,760
If you wouldn't mind,

46
00:02:45,761 --> 00:02:47,829
Mrs. Florrick, I think
it's better to avoid

47
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,430
any appearance of a conflict.

48
00:02:54,703 --> 00:02:57,438
* Stand up! *

49
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:59,841
(music filtering
through earbuds)

50
00:02:59,842 --> 00:03:04,312
Hi.

51
00:03:04,313 --> 00:03:06,347
Giada. Alicia, right?

52
00:03:06,348 --> 00:03:08,082
Yes. Are you waiting
for someone?

53
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:11,119
Yeah, Will. They told me
I could wait down here.

54
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,520
Oh. Uh, he'll be a while.

55
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:14,289
Oh, that's okay.

56
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,890
You're a friend from college,
right?

57
00:03:15,891 --> 00:03:17,158
Of Will's? Yes.

58
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,693
DePaul, third year.

59
00:03:18,694 --> 00:03:21,629
Oh, you're in law school.

60
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,332
He talks a lot about you;
almost makes me jealous.

61
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,367
Don't be.

62
00:03:26,368 --> 00:03:28,336
J. K.

63
00:03:28,337 --> 00:03:29,537
Just kidding.

64
00:03:29,538 --> 00:03:32,006
Nice meeting you.

65
00:03:32,007 --> 00:03:34,642
* Stand up! *

66
00:03:36,612 --> 00:03:38,213
* Stand up! *

67
00:03:41,584 --> 00:03:43,484
* Stand up! *

68
00:03:43,485 --> 00:03:44,886
* Whoo! *

69
00:03:44,887 --> 00:03:46,154
ARKIN:
That's Hunter.

70
00:03:46,155 --> 00:03:48,590
He set up the drop house
for the stash.

71
00:03:48,591 --> 00:03:49,858
That's Brad.

72
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:51,259
He stashes the meth.

73
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,127
And, uh, Foley,
he moves the guns.

74
00:03:53,128 --> 00:03:54,395
You have proof?

75
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:03,338
And where's this?

76
00:04:03,339 --> 00:04:04,339
(chuckles)

77
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,174
Mr. Arkin,

78
00:04:06,175 --> 00:04:09,077
at some risk to his own life,
took photos

79
00:04:09,078 --> 00:04:11,045
of the task force's drop house,

80
00:04:11,046 --> 00:04:13,348
and he will gladly share
the location

81
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:15,783
upon receipt
of an immunity deal.

82
00:04:15,784 --> 00:04:19,187
You said there were other
corrupt cops involved, Mr. Arkin.

83
00:04:19,188 --> 00:04:22,357
If you could study these photos
from these other busts.

84
00:04:24,493 --> 00:04:27,829
I don't know his name,
but... him,

85
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,198
him...

86
00:04:32,902 --> 00:04:34,802
...and him.

87
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:39,407
Him?
Yeah.

88
00:04:39,408 --> 00:04:41,943
Okay. I'll need a week
to brief my superiors,

89
00:04:41,944 --> 00:04:46,247
and then we can work
out the details.

90
00:05:00,362 --> 00:05:01,796
Hi.

91
00:05:01,797 --> 00:05:03,197
You're late.

92
00:05:03,198 --> 00:05:05,566
Yep.

93
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:08,236
You're unhappy.
No.

94
00:05:08,237 --> 00:05:09,804
I'm drinking.

95
00:05:19,114 --> 00:05:23,251
Tony, you know this stuff
you're slipping me,

96
00:05:23,252 --> 00:05:25,119
crime reports and evidence?

97
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,722
You ever worry
about getting caught?

98
00:05:27,723 --> 00:05:29,924
Getting caught?
Mm.

99
00:05:29,925 --> 00:05:31,426
Slipping you things?

100
00:05:32,094 --> 00:05:35,263
(chuckles) No!

101
00:05:35,264 --> 00:05:36,798
No. Why?

102
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:39,334
Just part of doing business.

103
00:05:39,335 --> 00:05:43,638
Yeah. I mean, it's...
it's for a friend.

104
00:05:45,074 --> 00:05:47,342
Some things you do
for a friend.

105
00:05:50,713 --> 00:05:52,347
I feel like you're
having this conversation

106
00:05:52,348 --> 00:05:55,984
with yourself, and...
and I'm just listening in.

107
00:05:55,985 --> 00:06:00,254
No, I'm just... I'm just
figuring you out, that's all.

108
00:06:00,255 --> 00:06:02,423
(laughter)

109
00:06:02,424 --> 00:06:05,560
No, the only problem was
that Jackie got a piñata.

110
00:06:05,561 --> 00:06:07,662
So we all went outside
in the middle of a rainstorm.

111
00:06:07,663 --> 00:06:09,030
And swinging bats at a piñata.

112
00:06:09,031 --> 00:06:10,331
Okay, where was I?

113
00:06:10,332 --> 00:06:11,666
Why haven't I heard about this?

114
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:13,234
Oh, and Grandma was worried

115
00:06:13,235 --> 00:06:15,136
about us using baseball bats.

116
00:06:15,137 --> 00:06:17,205
So she made everyone use
these little wooden spoons.

117
00:06:17,206 --> 00:06:19,173
PETER:
My wild and wacky family.

118
00:06:19,174 --> 00:06:20,742
You're stuck with us.

119
00:06:20,743 --> 00:06:23,811
For your first free meal,
you choose Obbie's?

120
00:06:23,812 --> 00:06:25,580
Ray.

121
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:28,416
Ray Ernesto, hey!

122
00:06:28,417 --> 00:06:30,952
Honey, this is Ray Ernesto,

123
00:06:30,953 --> 00:06:32,587
and he works for the
mayor's office.

124
00:06:32,588 --> 00:06:33,955
My children.

125
00:06:33,956 --> 00:06:35,957
Hi, kids. Just wanted to say
that Rich is a big fan,

126
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,592
Pete, always has
been, and he'd love

127
00:06:37,593 --> 00:06:40,461
to show his support.
I'd love it, but tell me

128
00:06:40,462 --> 00:06:41,929
you gotta leave that
dinosaur, Tolins & Brauer,

129
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,998
come talk to my wife
about her firm.

130
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:45,299
Oh, that's right,
you're at, um...

131
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,834
Lockhart/Gardner.

132
00:06:46,835 --> 00:06:48,436
Yeah, We just might
look you over.

133
00:06:48,437 --> 00:06:49,804
Oh, Pete, uh...

134
00:06:49,805 --> 00:06:51,606
"PE-Pete"?

135
00:06:53,876 --> 00:06:55,076
(whispering)

136
00:06:55,077 --> 00:06:56,377
(chuckling)

137
00:06:56,378 --> 00:06:57,879
Keep eating.
Yeah.

138
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,214
"Pete"?

139
00:07:01,483 --> 00:07:02,517
So what'd he say?

140
00:07:02,518 --> 00:07:04,385
He said that, uh,

141
00:07:04,386 --> 00:07:06,320
Childs' days are numbered.

142
00:07:06,321 --> 00:07:07,855
(chuckles)

143
00:07:07,856 --> 00:07:09,590
Wow, you're big-time now.

144
00:07:09,591 --> 00:07:11,559
I'm just the flavor of the week.

145
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,562
He'll be telling the same thing
to Childs tomorrow.

146
00:07:14,563 --> 00:07:16,330
Anything else I can get you?

147
00:07:16,331 --> 00:07:19,333
Uh, no, we're
good. Thank you

148
00:07:19,334 --> 00:07:20,501
So do you like it?

149
00:07:20,502 --> 00:07:22,236
Do I like what?

150
00:07:22,237 --> 00:07:24,572
Stuff, politics.

151
00:07:24,573 --> 00:07:26,641
Um, I don't know.

152
00:07:26,642 --> 00:07:28,743
I like what it can do.

153
00:07:28,744 --> 00:07:31,712
(phone rings)

154
00:07:31,713 --> 00:07:34,048
I'm sorry, it's work.

155
00:07:34,049 --> 00:07:35,550
Hello.

156
00:07:44,193 --> 00:07:45,927
No, thanks.

157
00:07:45,928 --> 00:07:47,395
I'm sorry...

158
00:07:47,396 --> 00:07:48,896
No dessert.

159
00:07:51,467 --> 00:07:53,334
(sighs)

160
00:07:53,335 --> 00:07:55,169
PETER:
What's wrong?

161
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:58,139
It's my client.

162
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,841
(tires squealing)

163
00:08:03,245 --> 00:08:07,148
DISPATCHER: ...00, officer
down at 373 Elmer Driver.

164
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:08,916
MAN:
Hey, lady, stop!

165
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:10,351
...00, officer down.

166
00:08:10,352 --> 00:08:12,253
All available units
reporting to...

167
00:08:15,057 --> 00:08:17,225
Hey, Kalinda,
you can't be here.

168
00:08:17,226 --> 00:08:18,759
What happened?
Out.

169
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,528
Out, and I'll tell you.

170
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:22,497
OFFICER: Dispatch, we
got an officer down.

171
00:08:22,498 --> 00:08:25,266
Jack Arkin's down.
I repeat, Jack Arkin...

172
00:08:25,267 --> 00:08:28,436
(sirens wailing,
tires screeching)

173
00:08:28,437 --> 00:08:31,172
We raided this meth house, and
the shot came out of nowhere.

174
00:08:31,173 --> 00:08:33,107
Top of the stairs.

175
00:08:33,108 --> 00:08:34,809
Meth dealer named Gorman.

176
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,611
We'd been following him
around for six months.

177
00:08:36,612 --> 00:08:39,180
Traded fire, we took him down.

178
00:08:39,181 --> 00:08:40,915
Why was Jack through
the door alone?

179
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,583
He wasn't through the door
alone. We were there.

180
00:08:42,584 --> 00:08:44,852
Just not fast enough, right?

181
00:08:44,853 --> 00:08:46,821
(indistinct radio chatter,
car doors closing)

182
00:08:47,656 --> 00:08:49,757
You excuse me for a second?

183
00:08:52,694 --> 00:08:55,630
(indistinct chatter)



185
00:09:08,192 --> 00:09:10,827
I'm sorry, are you really
blaming me for this leak?

186
00:09:10,828 --> 00:09:14,630
Within 24 hours of our proffer,
our client was dead.

187
00:09:14,631 --> 00:09:16,098
Yes, and we're very saddened,

188
00:09:16,099 --> 00:09:18,701
but we can still get these
corrupt cops off the street.

189
00:09:18,702 --> 00:09:20,570
By giving you
the stash location?

190
00:09:20,571 --> 00:09:22,371
Unfortunately, he never gave

191
00:09:22,372 --> 00:09:24,273
the location to us.

192
00:09:25,943 --> 00:09:27,643
Okay.

193
00:09:27,644 --> 00:09:30,746
Let's just chalk this up
as a bad first date.

194
00:09:33,784 --> 00:09:37,086
ALICIA:
I'm sorry to ask you this now,

195
00:09:37,087 --> 00:09:41,591
but you know our firm wants
to file suit against Cook County

196
00:09:41,592 --> 00:09:43,726
and the City of Chicago
for wrongful death?

197
00:09:43,727 --> 00:09:45,928
Yeah, they phoned.

198
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,168
I just don't want anyone to
think I'm profiting from this.

199
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:55,004
We worry Internal Affairs
will bury this

200
00:09:55,005 --> 00:09:56,806
'cause it's embarrassing
to the state's attorney.

201
00:09:56,807 --> 00:09:59,876
Give us a chance
to investigate it.

202
00:09:59,877 --> 00:10:01,344
By bringing a lawsuit?

203
00:10:01,345 --> 00:10:02,912
Yeah.

204
00:10:04,615 --> 00:10:07,750
So you think I should do this?

205
00:10:07,751 --> 00:10:13,022
I think bureaucracies
are often prompted

206
00:10:13,023 --> 00:10:16,926
to action by the
threat of money.

207
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,965
KALINDA: The task force
was targeting meth labs.

208
00:10:22,966 --> 00:10:25,701
Their story is that Arkin came
through the door first,

209
00:10:25,702 --> 00:10:28,537
and then was shot
by a meth dealer, Randy Gorman.

210
00:10:28,538 --> 00:10:31,140
Arkin ended up on his back here.

211
00:10:31,141 --> 00:10:33,843
Then the rest of the task force
returned fire, killing Gorman.

212
00:10:33,844 --> 00:10:35,544
But there's an inconsistency.

213
00:10:35,545 --> 00:10:37,713
Lab found Jack's blood
mixed with his saliva

214
00:10:37,714 --> 00:10:39,448
exactly two feet
from the body here.

215
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:40,850
DIANE:
Suggesting?

216
00:10:40,851 --> 00:10:43,452
That he fell face-first
onto the landing,

217
00:10:43,453 --> 00:10:45,288
then someone flipped him
over onto his back.

218
00:10:45,289 --> 00:10:48,024
It was staged.

219
00:10:48,025 --> 00:10:50,126
We'll need ballistics.
I'm on it.

220
00:10:52,262 --> 00:10:55,598
Okay, so our story is this:

221
00:10:55,599 --> 00:10:58,067
The task force discovered
Jack was gonna testify,

222
00:10:58,068 --> 00:10:59,535
killed Gorman,

223
00:10:59,536 --> 00:11:01,237
then used Gorman's gun
to kill Jack.

224
00:11:01,238 --> 00:11:04,073
Yeah. DIANE: Let's finish
this off in depositions.

225
00:11:04,074 --> 00:11:07,143
Cook County won't want
this in the press.

226
00:11:07,144 --> 00:11:08,611
You're hot on this.

227
00:11:08,612 --> 00:11:10,379
I'm friends with a lot of cops.

228
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,915
The bad ones hurt
the good ones.

229
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,451
So, this is a crusade?

230
00:11:15,452 --> 00:11:17,320
It's a job.

231
00:11:17,321 --> 00:11:19,488
And a job I'll do well.

232
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:24,727
Notice I'm here
as an invited guest

233
00:11:24,728 --> 00:11:26,495
now that I'm a client
of your firm.

234
00:11:26,496 --> 00:11:27,697
Yes.

235
00:11:27,698 --> 00:11:29,565
Welcome.

236
00:11:29,566 --> 00:11:31,033
Do you mind if I'm blunt,
Mrs. Florrick?

237
00:11:31,034 --> 00:11:32,635
Always a pleasure.

238
00:11:32,636 --> 00:11:35,705
I brought my business here.
I didn't have to.

239
00:11:35,706 --> 00:11:38,841
<i>Do you mind if I'm
blunt, Mr. Gold?</i>

240
00:11:38,842 --> 00:11:41,544
You brought your business here
because we're a good firm.

241
00:11:41,545 --> 00:11:44,046
And let's both agree
on one thing right now-

242
00:11:44,047 --> 00:11:47,049
there's a statute of limitations
on playing that card.

243
00:11:48,218 --> 00:11:50,419
Fair enough.

244
00:11:51,621 --> 00:11:53,823
This is Mimi Collins,

245
00:11:53,824 --> 00:11:56,692
a 24-year-old art student
at Whitley.

246
00:11:56,693 --> 00:11:59,261
Two years ago, she was raped
and brutally beaten

247
00:11:59,262 --> 00:12:01,597
by her ex-boyfriend,
a Michael Placedo.

248
00:12:01,598 --> 00:12:03,065
Well, if this is
a criminal matter,

249
00:12:03,066 --> 00:12:04,767
Mr. Gold, you can
take it upstairs.

250
00:12:04,768 --> 00:12:07,503
No. It's more of an allegory.

251
00:12:07,504 --> 00:12:10,139
Placedo was sentenced
to 20 years in prison

252
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,475
by the state's attorney
at the time- your husband.

253
00:12:12,476 --> 00:12:14,577
Mimi Collins went back
to college,

254
00:12:14,578 --> 00:12:16,779
a happy, healthy coed
with nothing to fear.

255
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,914
Somehow, I feel this
will end badly.

256
00:12:18,915 --> 00:12:20,216
Mm-hmm.

257
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:22,618
Glenn Childs,
in a general review

258
00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:25,621
of your husband's cases,
argued that Placedo be released

259
00:12:25,622 --> 00:12:26,789
with time served.

260
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,591
That is
Mimi Collins' body-

261
00:12:28,592 --> 00:12:31,060
found two weeks ago
in a Chicago landfill.

262
00:12:31,061 --> 00:12:33,496
Looks like your first
ad campaign. (chuckles)

263
00:12:33,497 --> 00:12:36,165
It would be...
if it weren't for the fact

264
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:39,201
that Peter has decided
to wait four years to run.

265
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:42,571
(chuckles) Really?

266
00:12:42,572 --> 00:12:45,641
Mm-hmm. He said that at dinner
with you and the kids,

267
00:12:45,642 --> 00:12:49,678
he was worried about the
"seductive allure of power."

268
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:51,847
Mr. Gold,

269
00:12:51,848 --> 00:12:55,885
who does the "seductive allure
of power" sound like to you?

270
00:12:55,886 --> 00:12:57,319
That's right.

271
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,354
The good pastor, Isaiah.

272
00:12:58,355 --> 00:13:00,289
I need you to talk to him.

273
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:03,059
He thinks he's trying
to restore your marriage.

274
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,960
Tell him you don't need that.

275
00:13:04,961 --> 00:13:07,663
Always good to see
you, Mr. Gold.

276
00:13:07,664 --> 00:13:09,732
Peter can't win without you.

277
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:11,634
You know that.

278
00:13:11,635 --> 00:13:15,337
<i>Peter only wins with your Good
Housekeeping seal of approval.</i>

279
00:13:15,338 --> 00:13:17,673
Voters need to see you together

280
00:13:17,674 --> 00:13:19,341
up on that stage holding hands.

281
00:13:19,342 --> 00:13:21,877
Good-bye, Mr. Gold.

282
00:13:21,878 --> 00:13:23,079
(gunshots, beeping)

283
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,549
(whirring, gunshots)

284
00:13:27,984 --> 00:13:31,287
Mr. Gorman got off
three rapid shots

285
00:13:31,288 --> 00:13:34,824
on the task force lead man,
your client, Mr. Arkin.

286
00:13:34,825 --> 00:13:39,361
All hit their target-
center, two high, one low.

287
00:13:39,362 --> 00:13:41,797
And this matches
the crime scene?

288
00:13:41,798 --> 00:13:44,400
No. My stairwell's
two steps taller.

289
00:13:44,401 --> 00:13:46,068
I've adjusted
by lowering the C-stand.

290
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:50,372
Now, Mr. Arkin fell as he
was firing here on the landing,

291
00:13:50,373 --> 00:13:52,708
while another member
of the task force

292
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:55,177
rushed in and fired
three shots from here.

293
00:13:55,178 --> 00:13:57,346
(gunshots)

294
00:13:58,915 --> 00:14:01,016
You all right?
Yes.

295
00:14:01,017 --> 00:14:03,986
What does it say about me
that I find this exhilarating?

296
00:14:03,987 --> 00:14:05,721
You're human.

297
00:14:05,722 --> 00:14:07,223
And are we saying
that the task force

298
00:14:07,224 --> 00:14:09,725
then planted a drop gun
on Mr. Gorman,

299
00:14:09,726 --> 00:14:12,328
or, uh... or
was it his?

300
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:15,164
It was his.

301
00:14:15,165 --> 00:14:17,733
Well, so how did this...

302
00:14:17,734 --> 00:14:20,236
I mean, are you saying...

303
00:14:21,738 --> 00:14:23,739
You're saying it happened
the way the police said?

304
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,007
Yes.

305
00:14:25,008 --> 00:14:27,209
It wasn't staged?

306
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,377
That's correct.

307
00:14:28,378 --> 00:14:29,578
And the...

308
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:31,680
And the blood and saliva stain?

309
00:14:31,681 --> 00:14:34,316
You don't think Mr. Arkin was
flipped over onto his back?

310
00:14:34,317 --> 00:14:37,219
No. My guess is that,
in the extremity of the moment,

311
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,654
one of Mr. Arkin's partners

312
00:14:38,655 --> 00:14:40,356
turned him on his back
to check his vitals,

313
00:14:40,357 --> 00:14:42,358
and they failed to report this
during the investigation.

314
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:45,794
You seem to accord the police
a great deal of honesty.

315
00:14:45,795 --> 00:14:47,329
I do.

316
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,368
And you brought me
out here to, what?

317
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:55,905
Your firm asked me
to examine the evidence.

318
00:14:55,906 --> 00:14:58,140
Well, we've asked you that
before, and you just said no.

319
00:14:58,141 --> 00:15:01,443
That's true.

320
00:15:01,444 --> 00:15:04,480
It's because
of my feelings for you

321
00:15:04,481 --> 00:15:06,749
that I've shown you this.

322
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,385
I won't bill you for the effort.

323
00:15:10,253 --> 00:15:12,221
Your feelings for me?

324
00:15:14,357 --> 00:15:17,359
I was approached by
the state's attorney's office.

325
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,931
To argue against our lawsuit?

326
00:15:21,932 --> 00:15:23,399
Yes.

327
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,000
I declined.

328
00:15:25,001 --> 00:15:28,003
I think you should do
what you want, Kurt.

329
00:15:28,004 --> 00:15:30,839
I think you should testify for
the state's attorney's office.

330
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,142
I wouldn't hesitate
to argue against you.

331
00:15:33,143 --> 00:15:36,145
(phone ringing)

332
00:15:37,847 --> 00:15:39,381
Let me think about it.

333
00:15:39,382 --> 00:15:42,184
I'll go get my purse.

334
00:15:44,788 --> 00:15:46,155
McVEIGH:
Yo...

335
00:15:46,156 --> 00:15:48,357
(camera shutter clicking)

336
00:15:52,229 --> 00:15:55,531
(camera shutter clicking)

337
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,334
WILL:
So, here we are.

338
00:15:58,335 --> 00:16:00,069
Dinner.
And I'm treating.

339
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:02,438
Damn right, you are.
(laughs)

340
00:16:03,273 --> 00:16:05,374
I ran into Alicia Florrick.

341
00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:07,876
Uh-huh. Where?

342
00:16:07,877 --> 00:16:09,278
At the office. She seems nice.

343
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,914
Yes, and a very talented lawyer.

344
00:16:11,915 --> 00:16:13,082
I'm sure.

345
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,216
I felt like I was intruding.

346
00:16:14,217 --> 00:16:16,418
You felt like
you were intruding?

347
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:17,786
I don't understand that.

348
00:16:17,787 --> 00:16:20,089
I felt like
I was getting checked out

349
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:22,558
by someone who had skin
in the game.

350
00:16:26,363 --> 00:16:27,963
WAITER: Senorita
Cabrini. Mmm.

351
00:16:27,964 --> 00:16:31,400
(speaking Spanish)

352
00:16:33,503 --> 00:16:37,006
(continuing in Spanish)

353
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,984
He likes you.

354
00:16:48,985 --> 00:16:49,985
I'm so glad.

355
00:16:49,986 --> 00:16:51,253
You want me to translate?

356
00:16:51,254 --> 00:16:52,988
I understood every word.

357
00:16:53,923 --> 00:16:56,625
(snickers) Oh.

358
00:16:57,427 --> 00:16:59,061
So, do you come here a lot?

359
00:16:59,062 --> 00:17:00,296
My dad does.

360
00:17:00,297 --> 00:17:02,898
Your dad?
Who-who's your dad?

361
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:06,001
If I tell you, you, uh,
promise not to freak out?

362
00:17:06,002 --> 00:17:08,070
Okay, not only do you
have to tell me now,

363
00:17:08,071 --> 00:17:09,271
but nothing could top
that introduction.

364
00:17:09,272 --> 00:17:10,539
Ernesto Cabrini.

365
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,341
I don't know who that...

366
00:17:12,342 --> 00:17:14,109
Wait, I do know who that is.

367
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,312
He's the fourth richest man
in Europe, right?

368
00:17:16,313 --> 00:17:17,846
Third, not that we're counting.

369
00:17:17,847 --> 00:17:19,148
So, men freak out about that?

370
00:17:19,149 --> 00:17:20,983
Only the ones
who are uncomfortable

371
00:17:20,984 --> 00:17:22,484
with their own masculinity.
Yeah.

372
00:17:22,485 --> 00:17:24,453
Hmm.

373
00:17:24,454 --> 00:17:26,388
WAITER:
Si, Senior.

374
00:17:26,389 --> 00:17:29,258
What's your most expensive
bottle of wine?

375
00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:31,026
(laughing)

376
00:17:32,329 --> 00:17:34,063
DIANE:
So, there's no pressure in this.

377
00:17:34,064 --> 00:17:35,531
It's just a deposition.

378
00:17:35,532 --> 00:17:37,833
They're polite
and uncomplicated.

379
00:17:37,834 --> 00:17:40,469
They're just going to want
basic information.

380
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,171
No one's trying
to score points.

381
00:17:42,172 --> 00:17:44,206
TRISH:
Thank you.

382
00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:51,213
(indistinct conversation)

383
00:17:51,214 --> 00:17:53,048
CARY: That's good.
All right, good.

384
00:17:54,017 --> 00:17:55,250
Cary, everything all right?

385
00:17:55,251 --> 00:17:56,919
Alicia. Hi.
How are you?

386
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,387
Um... I'm fine.

387
00:17:58,388 --> 00:17:59,955
How are you?

388
00:17:59,956 --> 00:18:01,290
I'm good, too.

389
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,524
Are you...

390
00:18:02,525 --> 00:18:04,393
Do you have a meeting with Will?

391
00:18:04,394 --> 00:18:05,494
No.

392
00:18:05,495 --> 00:18:07,129
Did you talk to reception?

393
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:08,364
No. I'm here for you.

394
00:18:08,365 --> 00:18:09,565
For me?

395
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:11,266
Yes, the deposition.

396
00:18:11,267 --> 00:18:13,135
I'm working with
Glenn Childs now.

397
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:34,355
Hi.

398
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,562
How much money did your
husband make last year?

399
00:18:41,563 --> 00:18:44,031
Uh... last year?

400
00:18:44,032 --> 00:18:46,166
Uh, I don't know.

401
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:49,002
My guess would be $55,000.

402
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:51,071
And is it true
that you took a vacation

403
00:18:51,072 --> 00:18:53,006
in Antigua last February?

404
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:54,441
Yes.

405
00:18:54,442 --> 00:18:55,843
Do you remember
how much it cost?

406
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:59,913
No.
$8,545 and change.

407
00:18:59,914 --> 00:19:01,815
That, ma'am, is over 15%

408
00:19:01,816 --> 00:19:03,617
of your husband's
yearly salary.

409
00:19:03,618 --> 00:19:05,085
I work, too.

410
00:19:06,654 --> 00:19:08,589
Yeah, part-time
as a nurse.

411
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,591
That's an additional
23 grand a year.

412
00:19:10,592 --> 00:19:11,792
ALICIA:
Just to save you time,

413
00:19:11,793 --> 00:19:13,761
Cary, we would stipulate

414
00:19:13,762 --> 00:19:15,763
to Mr. Arkin's involvement
in the task force's corruption.

415
00:19:15,764 --> 00:19:16,864
Yes.

416
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:18,899
Thank you, Mrs. Florrick.

417
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,068
I know that you would stipulate,
but I'm looking to itemize.

418
00:19:21,069 --> 00:19:24,171
Now, let's turn to your
domestic dispute charges

419
00:19:24,172 --> 00:19:26,473
against your husband.

420
00:19:26,474 --> 00:19:28,809
WILL:
Cute of the state's attorney.

421
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,678
Shows some unexpected wit.

422
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,580
Cary's a good lawyer.

423
00:19:33,581 --> 00:19:35,816
WILL: You think we
made the wrong decision?

424
00:19:35,817 --> 00:19:38,585
Not necessarily.

425
00:19:38,586 --> 00:19:41,522
Let's see how well
he does against us.

426
00:19:41,523 --> 00:19:43,190
What's Cary doing here?

427
00:19:43,191 --> 00:19:45,058
Working for the opposition.

428
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,994
(chuckles) Smart.

429
00:19:46,995 --> 00:19:48,429
He's drawing blood, too.

430
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,798
Look, I have some thoughts

431
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,166
about finding this secret stash.

432
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:53,734
Good. That could help us
with a settlement.

433
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:55,002
Keep us informed.

434
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:01,208
JACKIE:
Mr. Daley called.

435
00:20:01,209 --> 00:20:03,010
Said he wanted
to call Peter before,

436
00:20:03,011 --> 00:20:05,012
but he was too busy.

437
00:20:05,013 --> 00:20:07,314
I knew exactly what he...

438
00:20:10,852 --> 00:20:12,619
Would you excuse me a second?

439
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,721
Looking for a Miss...

440
00:20:18,626 --> 00:20:21,462
Mr., uh... what was it again?

441
00:20:21,463 --> 00:20:23,597
Goldman?
Gold.

442
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:25,466
Mrs. Florrick, hello.

443
00:20:25,467 --> 00:20:28,202
I thought you might be able to
help me with a little problem.

444
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,104
Well, this isn't really
the place.

445
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,574
Yes. Unfortunately, this
is a time-sensitive matter

446
00:20:33,575 --> 00:20:35,008
regarding your son.

447
00:20:51,226 --> 00:20:52,926
Peter is questioning whether

448
00:20:52,927 --> 00:20:54,595
to wait four years
before running.

449
00:20:54,596 --> 00:20:56,330
No, he's not.

450
00:20:56,331 --> 00:20:57,998
I'm sorry- he is.

451
00:20:57,999 --> 00:20:59,933
And if we don't file by the end

452
00:20:59,934 --> 00:21:02,002
of the week, we'll be forced
to wait four years.

453
00:21:02,904 --> 00:21:04,738
You're not lying?

454
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,541
(repressed chuckle) No.

455
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:11,745
Sorry- I wish I were.

456
00:21:11,746 --> 00:21:14,581
Pastor Isaiah talked to him.

457
00:21:14,582 --> 00:21:17,951
Who introduced him
to this pastor?

458
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,953
I did, but not with
that intention.

459
00:21:19,954 --> 00:21:23,891
Mr. Gold, there is one thing
you need to know about my son.

460
00:21:23,892 --> 00:21:25,826
He is easily moved.

461
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:29,263
You need to prescreen
the people who see him.

462
00:21:29,264 --> 00:21:32,266
And I will talk to this man.

463
00:21:32,267 --> 00:21:36,904
Plan on making the announcement
by the end of the week.

464
00:21:36,905 --> 00:21:38,939
Thank you.

465
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,909
Are you good, Mr. Gold?

466
00:21:42,744 --> 00:21:45,045
Am I good?

467
00:21:45,046 --> 00:21:46,947
Uh, I'm the best, ma'am.

468
00:21:46,948 --> 00:21:49,182
I will need you to be.

469
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:51,952
(elegant music playing,
guests chatting)

470
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:56,823
Shalom.

471
00:21:56,824 --> 00:21:58,325
Objection.

472
00:21:58,326 --> 00:22:00,327
Plaintiff's counsel
has an ongoing relationship

473
00:22:00,328 --> 00:22:02,062
with the expert witness.

474
00:22:02,063 --> 00:22:03,830
That seems more like a reason

475
00:22:03,831 --> 00:22:05,332
you shouldn't hire him

476
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:06,800
than I shouldn't question him.

477
00:22:06,801 --> 00:22:09,770
I'm preserving
my objection for trial.

478
00:22:13,675 --> 00:22:15,876
Mr. McVeigh,

479
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:18,011
on Tuesday last, did you
conduct an experiment

480
00:22:18,012 --> 00:22:20,814
duplicating the April 16th
officer shooting?

481
00:22:20,815 --> 00:22:22,316
I did.

482
00:22:22,317 --> 00:22:24,785
And this experiment was
conducted at your farm?

483
00:22:24,786 --> 00:22:25,786
It was.

484
00:22:25,787 --> 00:22:27,020
In your barn?

485
00:22:27,021 --> 00:22:28,755
Yes.
And this experiment led to

486
00:22:28,756 --> 00:22:31,825
your conclusion that the police
investigation was accurate?

487
00:22:31,826 --> 00:22:33,360
That's correct.

488
00:22:33,361 --> 00:22:35,629
Are you familiar
with the FBI standards

489
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,364
for ballistic investigation?

490
00:22:38,266 --> 00:22:40,000
I am.

491
00:22:40,001 --> 00:22:43,203
Was this investigation
in your barn

492
00:22:43,204 --> 00:22:44,838
in accordance
with those standards?

493
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:47,240
In most respects.

494
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:48,375
So, in some respects,

495
00:22:48,376 --> 00:22:49,443
it wasn't?

496
00:22:49,444 --> 00:22:51,011
That would follow.

497
00:22:51,012 --> 00:22:52,679
So that would be a yes?

498
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,147
You are correct.

499
00:22:54,148 --> 00:22:55,949
The assailant's firearm
was lowered through the use

500
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,284
of a C-stand?

501
00:22:57,285 --> 00:22:58,852
Yes.

502
00:22:58,853 --> 00:23:00,354
And the FBI standards

503
00:23:00,355 --> 00:23:02,089
caution that a C-stand

504
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,224
is not a steady base
for a firearm?

505
00:23:04,225 --> 00:23:06,727
I believe that's correct.

506
00:23:06,728 --> 00:23:07,928
You believe?

507
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:10,797
Yes, I believe.

508
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:11,832
Well, then

509
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:12,866
let's move on.

510
00:23:12,867 --> 00:23:14,635
In what other ways
do your home-spun

511
00:23:14,636 --> 00:23:17,304
investigative methods
clash with FBI standards?

512
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:25,412
Do you need a minute,
Mr. McVeigh?

513
00:23:40,328 --> 00:23:43,030
TRISH:
I'm sorry.

514
00:23:43,031 --> 00:23:45,932
What are you looking for?

515
00:23:45,933 --> 00:23:49,069
These cell phone photos
leave a date and time.

516
00:23:52,874 --> 00:23:54,141
There.

517
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:56,276
Saturday, March 13.

518
00:23:56,277 --> 00:23:58,278
How does that help you?

519
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:01,248
Do you have
your credit card bills?

520
00:24:28,142 --> 00:24:31,645
* *

521
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,128
(dialing)

522
00:24:48,129 --> 00:24:49,362
(phone line ringing)

523
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:51,264
<i>KALINDA:
Hey, so let's say</i>

524
00:24:51,265 --> 00:24:54,601
<i>I need to get into
a storage locker.</i>

525
00:24:55,903 --> 00:24:58,472
See how much fun
it is being a Fed.

526
00:24:58,473 --> 00:25:00,440
24-hour court orders.

527
00:25:00,441 --> 00:25:02,676
Thank you.
Thanks.

528
00:25:14,122 --> 00:25:15,355
Here we go.

529
00:25:16,991 --> 00:25:18,592
Who you calling?

530
00:25:18,593 --> 00:25:21,428
Lockhart/Gardner.

531
00:25:26,033 --> 00:25:27,167
Something on your mind?

532
00:25:27,168 --> 00:25:30,971
Let me see your phone.

533
00:25:30,972 --> 00:25:33,206
Why?

534
00:25:33,207 --> 00:25:35,942
I want to see
who you're phoning.

535
00:25:35,943 --> 00:25:36,977
No.

536
00:25:36,978 --> 00:25:38,445
Why?

537
00:25:38,446 --> 00:25:40,547
Because I don't like
to be questioned.

538
00:25:46,287 --> 00:25:48,955
Mr. Arkin said there were
three other corrupt cops,

539
00:25:48,956 --> 00:25:52,192
so we immediately
put them under surveillance.

540
00:25:52,193 --> 00:25:55,395
This is you with
a Detective Anthony Burton

541
00:25:55,396 --> 00:25:57,497
two hours after our proffer,

542
00:25:57,498 --> 00:26:00,267
one hour before
Mr. Arkin was murdered.

543
00:26:03,337 --> 00:26:06,139
And here you are...

544
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,041
Ten minutes later in his car.

545
00:26:08,042 --> 00:26:10,877
So?

546
00:26:10,878 --> 00:26:13,613
So, Kalinda...

547
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:17,250
There were only five of us
in that room for that proffer,

548
00:26:17,251 --> 00:26:21,021
and one of us leaked.

549
00:26:21,022 --> 00:26:23,290
Oh, so that's why

550
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:26,359
these photos are so important.

551
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,129
This one of me in the car.

552
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:32,566
'Cause it shows
me... leaking.

553
00:26:32,567 --> 00:26:35,902
It shows you
in a compromised position.

554
00:26:35,903 --> 00:26:38,004
With a man.

555
00:26:38,005 --> 00:26:40,106
With a corrupt cop.

556
00:26:40,107 --> 00:26:42,976
And yet I phoned you

557
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:45,278
to tell you about
the stash, didn't I?

558
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,148
Which I wouldn't do
if I were compromised.

559
00:26:50,051 --> 00:26:51,551
True.

560
00:26:54,288 --> 00:26:56,690
I guess I could
just be confused.

561
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,900
Good job, Kalinda.
Anything you can find

562
00:27:06,901 --> 00:27:09,102
to tie it to the task force
would help.

563
00:27:09,103 --> 00:27:10,470
Are you all right?

564
00:27:10,471 --> 00:27:12,606
You sound like
you've been running.

565
00:27:12,607 --> 00:27:14,307
Okay.

566
00:27:14,308 --> 00:27:15,575
(quiet chatter)

567
00:27:26,721 --> 00:27:28,555
Something special?

568
00:27:28,556 --> 00:27:30,423
Just an $8,000 bottle of wine.

569
00:27:30,424 --> 00:27:32,158
A what?

570
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,728
An $8,000 bottle of wine.

571
00:27:34,729 --> 00:27:38,698
So you're a kept man
these days, eh?

572
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:40,667
I'm working on it.

573
00:27:42,403 --> 00:27:43,703
ALICIA:
You just said the opposite.

574
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:45,272
No, I did not, ma'am.

575
00:27:45,273 --> 00:27:46,539
Then I don't understand.

576
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,475
Well, I can't help
you with that.

577
00:27:48,476 --> 00:27:50,577
Look, we found
your stash location.

578
00:27:50,578 --> 00:27:52,178
You saw the police
investigative report.

579
00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:54,281
You saw the crime scene photos.

580
00:27:54,282 --> 00:27:56,182
So how did
Mr. Arkin's saliva end up

581
00:27:56,183 --> 00:27:58,385
on the landing two feet away
from his body?

582
00:27:58,386 --> 00:28:00,987
Why don't we take a break.
No, I think we're fine.

583
00:28:00,988 --> 00:28:02,455
Do you have an answer,
Mr. Hunter?

584
00:28:02,456 --> 00:28:04,090
You say you didn't
touch the body.

585
00:28:04,091 --> 00:28:06,159
So how did he end up
on his back?

586
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,028
I want to confer with counsel.

587
00:28:08,029 --> 00:28:09,396
ALICIA: If that'll help
you get to the truth,

588
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:10,563
sure.

589
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,232
(whispering)

590
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:16,703
Okay, no problem.

591
00:28:16,704 --> 00:28:20,707
Mr. Hunter would like
to adjust his testimony.

592
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:23,310
Adjust?

593
00:28:23,311 --> 00:28:24,744
Let's adjust.

594
00:28:26,614 --> 00:28:29,182
I did move Jack Arkin's body.

595
00:28:29,183 --> 00:28:31,184
And why did you do that, sir?

596
00:28:31,185 --> 00:28:35,188
Jack was shot
and fell face forward.

597
00:28:35,189 --> 00:28:38,291
I, then, after firing upon
and killing Mr. Gorman,

598
00:28:38,292 --> 00:28:41,094
proceeded to turn Jack over
onto his back

599
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:42,529
because he was wearing a wire,

600
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:46,066
trying to nail us.

601
00:28:46,067 --> 00:28:47,300
Where is this wire?

602
00:28:47,301 --> 00:28:48,735
We gave it to Internal Affairs.

603
00:28:48,736 --> 00:28:50,270
This wire will be
supplied to you

604
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:52,005
at the end of
the business day today.

605
00:28:52,006 --> 00:28:53,673
And guess what, lady?

606
00:28:53,674 --> 00:28:57,077
That wire that was
supposed to catch us-

607
00:28:57,078 --> 00:28:59,713
it shows this thing went down
exactly the way we said.

608
00:28:59,714 --> 00:29:02,082
So I'll be waiting
for your apology.

609
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:04,317
You know what I would do
if I were you, Alicia?

610
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,488
I'd prepare
for a season of losing.

611
00:29:16,178 --> 00:29:17,979
(three gunshots over recorder)

612
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,882
(men shouting)

613
00:29:20,883 --> 00:29:23,985
(three gunshots)

614
00:29:23,986 --> 00:29:25,853
(shouting continues)

615
00:29:25,854 --> 00:29:27,688
(recorder clicks off)

616
00:29:27,689 --> 00:29:29,357
So they're saying this supports
their version of events.

617
00:29:29,358 --> 00:29:31,325
I hate to say it,
but I think it does.

618
00:29:31,326 --> 00:29:34,228
No, doesn't matter
if it supports it.

619
00:29:34,229 --> 00:29:35,797
What do you mean?

620
00:29:35,798 --> 00:29:37,999
Look at the incident report.

621
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,401
German was lying in wait,
gun in hands.

622
00:29:40,402 --> 00:29:42,336
And within seconds of Arkin
coming through the door,

623
00:29:42,337 --> 00:29:43,437
German was firing.

624
00:29:43,438 --> 00:29:45,006
So it was a setup?

625
00:29:45,007 --> 00:29:46,274
Well, the task force knew

626
00:29:46,275 --> 00:29:47,675
Arkin was the first one
through the door.

627
00:29:47,676 --> 00:29:49,010
They didn't need to kill Arkin.

628
00:29:49,011 --> 00:29:50,945
They just needed
Gorman to do it.

629
00:29:52,881 --> 00:29:55,383
Okay, wrongful death
is wrongful death.

630
00:29:55,384 --> 00:29:56,918
So let's look at Gorman.

631
00:29:56,919 --> 00:29:58,920
Did someone contact him?
Check phone records-

632
00:29:58,921 --> 00:30:00,655
any acquaintance
in common with Hunter.

633
00:30:02,324 --> 00:30:04,292
Please forgive the lateness,
people.

634
00:30:04,293 --> 00:30:06,227
We'll get started.

635
00:30:06,228 --> 00:30:07,695
Just come right in.

636
00:30:07,696 --> 00:30:10,231
There you go.

637
00:30:10,232 --> 00:30:12,066
And grab a seat,
make yourselves at...

638
00:30:12,067 --> 00:30:14,302
At home.

639
00:30:16,071 --> 00:30:19,807
There you go.
There you go.

640
00:30:19,808 --> 00:30:21,576
Mrs. Florrick.

641
00:30:21,577 --> 00:30:22,743
Pastor Isaiah.

642
00:30:22,744 --> 00:30:24,145
How are you?
Hello.

643
00:30:24,146 --> 00:30:25,746
What can I do for you?

644
00:30:25,747 --> 00:30:27,982
You can leave my son alone.

645
00:30:29,852 --> 00:30:30,885
Won't you come in?

646
00:30:30,886 --> 00:30:33,154
You say you're a man of God;

647
00:30:33,155 --> 00:30:35,323
Then stop making him
feel this way.

648
00:30:35,324 --> 00:30:36,991
What way is that, ma'am?

649
00:30:36,992 --> 00:30:38,392
Like he's a bad man.

650
00:30:38,393 --> 00:30:41,229
He is a bad man.

651
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,164
I'm a bad man. Even
you, Mrs. Florrick.

652
00:30:43,165 --> 00:30:45,099
Who do you think you are?

653
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,834
You think you know people?

654
00:30:46,835 --> 00:30:48,436
You just use the same words
with everyone.

655
00:30:48,437 --> 00:30:50,972
Y- You just say "God"
and you think

656
00:30:50,973 --> 00:30:52,940
you can make people feel bad
about themselves.

657
00:30:52,941 --> 00:30:56,777
Mrs. Florrick, your
son approached me.

658
00:30:56,778 --> 00:30:59,213
He asked advice from me.

659
00:30:59,214 --> 00:31:01,782
I will continue to
offer that advice.

660
00:31:01,783 --> 00:31:04,485
And I will do everything
in my power to stop you.

661
00:31:04,486 --> 00:31:06,153
You don't know my son.

662
00:31:06,154 --> 00:31:09,090
This is a phase.
You are a phase.

663
00:31:09,958 --> 00:31:11,592
Then we'll see.

664
00:31:11,593 --> 00:31:13,561
No, you'll see.

665
00:31:13,562 --> 00:31:16,097
He's running, this year.

666
00:31:16,098 --> 00:31:19,600
He's my blood; and I don't know
what your God does,

667
00:31:19,601 --> 00:31:21,669
but it doesn't match that.

668
00:31:28,176 --> 00:31:30,278
(knocks quietly)

669
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:31,345
Dinner.

670
00:31:31,346 --> 00:31:34,081
We're never getting out.

671
00:31:34,082 --> 00:31:36,217
Let's do it.

672
00:31:36,218 --> 00:31:38,719
(Alicia and Will laughing)

673
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,121
WILL:
The first time we met?

674
00:31:40,122 --> 00:31:43,257
It was a pool party, wasn't it?

675
00:31:43,258 --> 00:31:45,059
Indoctrination- or
what do they call it?

676
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,527
Orientation.
(laughs)

677
00:31:46,528 --> 00:31:49,230
Yeah, it was a
midnight pool party.

678
00:31:49,231 --> 00:31:50,765
About a hundred law
students trying to

679
00:31:50,766 --> 00:31:52,333
impress each other.
Did you swim?

680
00:31:52,334 --> 00:31:53,834
No, I was too shy.

681
00:31:53,835 --> 00:31:55,269
You were the one
doing cannonballs.

682
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,104
God, that is so embarrassing.

683
00:31:57,105 --> 00:31:58,472
Mm-mm.

684
00:31:58,473 --> 00:32:00,207
It wasn't at the time.

685
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:04,845
So... what did you think of me?

686
00:32:04,846 --> 00:32:07,415
Ah... no.

687
00:32:07,416 --> 00:32:09,550
What?

688
00:32:09,551 --> 00:32:11,118
Dangerous conversation.

689
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:12,820
Well, now you have to tell me.

690
00:32:12,821 --> 00:32:15,289
Come on, I'll tell you
what I thought of you.

691
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:17,992
(chuckles)

692
00:32:17,993 --> 00:32:19,994
So Giada seems sweet.

693
00:32:19,995 --> 00:32:21,295
(laughs)

694
00:32:21,296 --> 00:32:22,229
There's a segue.

695
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,531
Yes, she is sweet.

696
00:32:23,532 --> 00:32:25,366
And third year at DePaul.

697
00:32:25,367 --> 00:32:27,401
Yeah, she's just
getting her retainer out.

698
00:32:27,402 --> 00:32:29,603
(chuckles)

699
00:32:31,239 --> 00:32:34,208
So is it always gonna be
this way, between us?

700
00:32:34,209 --> 00:32:36,010
I want to say yes,

701
00:32:36,011 --> 00:32:37,812
but I want to know
what you mean.

702
00:32:38,914 --> 00:32:42,516
Just... talking.

703
00:32:42,517 --> 00:32:44,618
Being casual and...
Blunt?

704
00:32:52,928 --> 00:32:55,463
I like myself
around you, Alicia.

705
00:32:55,464 --> 00:32:57,932
I don't like myself
around a lot of people.

706
00:32:57,933 --> 00:33:00,201
You do.

707
00:33:00,202 --> 00:33:01,569
It's an act.

708
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:04,739
It's perfected
over a millennium.

709
00:33:07,676 --> 00:33:09,176
(phone ringing)

710
00:33:09,177 --> 00:33:11,312
(chuckles)

711
00:33:11,313 --> 00:33:13,180
Don't answer it.

712
00:33:13,181 --> 00:33:14,348
It's just life again.

713
00:33:14,349 --> 00:33:16,083
Yes, and that's why I have to.

714
00:33:16,084 --> 00:33:18,519
Hello.

715
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,354
Kalinda, what's up?

716
00:33:20,355 --> 00:33:24,158
No, I'm just with Will.

717
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,526
No.

718
00:33:27,362 --> 00:33:30,364
Okay, I'll...
I'll meet you there.

719
00:33:30,365 --> 00:33:31,999
Kalinda got the dealer

720
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,100
Gorman's phone records.

721
00:33:33,101 --> 00:33:34,268
The night of the shooting,

722
00:33:34,269 --> 00:33:36,003
he had two calls
from a Hank Lydell.

723
00:33:36,004 --> 00:33:37,972
Hank Lydell?
Who's Hank Lydell?

724
00:33:37,973 --> 00:33:39,273
No idea.

725
00:33:39,274 --> 00:33:41,042
Kalinda checked, no priors.

726
00:33:41,043 --> 00:33:42,043
I'm gonna meet her there.

727
00:33:42,044 --> 00:33:44,311
Okay.

728
00:33:44,312 --> 00:33:45,946
Nice dinner.

729
00:33:45,947 --> 00:33:48,416
It was worth the wait.

730
00:33:49,351 --> 00:33:51,552
We always have options, Alicia.

731
00:33:54,423 --> 00:33:56,590
I'm just saying.

732
00:34:06,601 --> 00:34:07,902
(sighs)

733
00:34:07,903 --> 00:34:10,938
(crickets chirping,
dog barking)

734
00:34:10,939 --> 00:34:13,374
We have no idea who
Hank Lydell is? Mm-hmm.

735
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:15,509
Or why he was urgently
phoning a meth dealer

736
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,411
an hour before he killed a cop.

737
00:34:17,412 --> 00:34:19,213
It doesn't look
like an addict's house.

738
00:34:19,214 --> 00:34:22,316
I don't think there is a look
to an addict's house.

739
00:34:22,317 --> 00:34:24,752
Mm. What were you
doing with Will?

740
00:34:24,753 --> 00:34:27,455
Having dinner.

741
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:29,390
Thank you for waiting.

742
00:34:29,391 --> 00:34:32,159
Mr. Lydell is
right this way.

743
00:34:33,762 --> 00:34:35,329
That's very unlikely.

744
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:37,164
Hank has some good days,

745
00:34:37,165 --> 00:34:40,000
but his arthritis keeps him
from dialing the phone.

746
00:34:40,001 --> 00:34:43,104
And you've never heard him
talk about a man named German?

747
00:34:43,105 --> 00:34:44,405
No.

748
00:34:44,406 --> 00:34:47,141
Who else has access
to the phone?

749
00:34:47,142 --> 00:34:48,709
Here? Any of us.

750
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,211
Us?

751
00:34:50,212 --> 00:34:51,212
Nursing care.

752
00:34:51,213 --> 00:34:52,680
Hank has 24-hour
nursing care.

753
00:34:52,681 --> 00:34:54,515
I have the graveyard shift.

754
00:34:54,516 --> 00:34:56,250
Is there anyway to find out

755
00:34:56,251 --> 00:34:58,252
who was the nurse on duty

756
00:34:58,253 --> 00:35:00,387
the night of the
killing, April 15th?

757
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:05,092
That was... Trish.

758
00:35:05,093 --> 00:35:06,460
Trish Arkin.

759
00:35:08,697 --> 00:35:11,599
Did I say something wrong?

760
00:35:14,636 --> 00:35:20,441
No. It's just that's
the wife of the deceased.

761
00:35:24,812 --> 00:35:26,446
So our client did it?

762
00:35:26,447 --> 00:35:28,648
She apparently warned
the meth dealer

763
00:35:28,649 --> 00:35:30,216
that her husband was
coming to arrest him.

764
00:35:30,217 --> 00:35:31,818
How did she even know him?

765
00:35:31,819 --> 00:35:33,420
Apparently through the husband.

766
00:35:33,421 --> 00:35:34,654
WILL: And the rest
of the task force?

767
00:35:34,655 --> 00:35:35,955
Innocent.

768
00:35:35,956 --> 00:35:38,491
Well, we don't know that
for sure.

769
00:35:38,492 --> 00:35:41,628
But it does look like
it was just Arkin

770
00:35:41,629 --> 00:35:43,430
who was stashing
the weapons and the drugs.

771
00:35:43,431 --> 00:35:46,466
He realized internal affairs
was looking into him,

772
00:35:46,467 --> 00:35:47,867
so he thought
he would make a deal

773
00:35:47,868 --> 00:35:49,636
and turn on his partners.
And Trish?

774
00:35:49,637 --> 00:35:51,104
KALINDA:
She was a battered woman;

775
00:35:51,105 --> 00:35:52,772
Didn't want to enter

776
00:35:52,773 --> 00:35:54,474
witness relocation
with her husband.

777
00:35:54,475 --> 00:35:55,809
Well, that explains the leak.

778
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:57,744
When we counted
who was in the room,

779
00:35:57,745 --> 00:36:00,046
we didn't count the wife.
Yep.

780
00:36:01,015 --> 00:36:02,415
And you want to hear

781
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:03,683
an even greater irony?

782
00:36:03,684 --> 00:36:05,752
Cook County wants
to avoid embarrassment.

783
00:36:05,753 --> 00:36:07,654
They just made us an offer

784
00:36:07,655 --> 00:36:09,889
to drop the case.
How much?

785
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,891
A half a million.

786
00:36:11,892 --> 00:36:17,297
So Trish gets her husband
killed, blames the police

787
00:36:17,298 --> 00:36:19,899
and makes a cool half mill.

788
00:36:25,806 --> 00:36:28,441
Are we taking it?

789
00:36:28,442 --> 00:36:31,544
Well, I don't think
we can get them any higher.

790
00:36:31,545 --> 00:36:35,381
No, I mean,
are we taking anything?

791
00:36:35,382 --> 00:36:37,083
She's guilty, and
she'll get off.

792
00:36:37,084 --> 00:36:38,818
She's our client.

793
00:36:38,819 --> 00:36:40,954
It's our job.

794
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:45,725
And at what point
is our job wrong?

795
00:36:45,726 --> 00:36:47,260
When it fails our client.

796
00:36:49,897 --> 00:36:53,233
So let's advise our client to...
to accept the offer.

797
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,580
(gunshot)

798
00:37:07,581 --> 00:37:09,716
(buzzer sounds)

799
00:37:16,757 --> 00:37:18,291
(gunshot)

800
00:37:19,126 --> 00:37:22,829
(buzzer sounds)

801
00:37:44,652 --> 00:37:47,120
So I seem to be a suspect.

802
00:37:47,121 --> 00:37:51,057
Apparently, internal affairs
is looking into my connection

803
00:37:51,058 --> 00:37:52,358
with the Arkin shooting.

804
00:37:52,359 --> 00:37:53,993
Yeah, I heard.

805
00:37:53,994 --> 00:37:56,930
This stuff seems to be
coming from your lawsuit.

806
00:37:56,931 --> 00:37:58,164
That's right.

807
00:37:58,165 --> 00:38:02,068
So why all the questions

808
00:38:02,069 --> 00:38:05,471
about what I do for friends?

809
00:38:05,472 --> 00:38:07,974
What, you thought I did it?

810
00:38:10,077 --> 00:38:11,644
Yeah.

811
00:38:13,547 --> 00:38:15,682
Go to hell.

812
00:38:20,654 --> 00:38:21,921
What?

813
00:38:21,922 --> 00:38:23,156
What?!

814
00:38:23,157 --> 00:38:24,991
Nothing. I just, um...

815
00:38:30,464 --> 00:38:32,098
I'm sorry.

816
00:38:39,607 --> 00:38:40,974
What is this?

817
00:38:40,975 --> 00:38:43,109
Who really tipped off Gorman.

818
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,688
(Mic feedback)
One, two. Mic check, testing...

819
00:38:55,689 --> 00:38:57,991
So, is this just an
exoneration victory lap

820
00:38:57,992 --> 00:38:59,459
or is he going to announce?

821
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,094
Gail, you'll find out
in one hour.

822
00:39:01,095 --> 00:39:02,562
Oh, come on.

823
00:39:02,563 --> 00:39:04,497
Mrs. Florrick going to
be on stage with him?

824
00:39:04,498 --> 00:39:05,565
(phone ringing)

825
00:39:05,566 --> 00:39:06,766
Excuse me.

826
00:39:06,767 --> 00:39:07,834
This is Gold.

827
00:39:07,835 --> 00:39:11,070
(distant Mic feedback squeals)

828
00:39:11,071 --> 00:39:12,872
I don't know.

829
00:39:12,873 --> 00:39:15,475
They're not going to leave us
alone- the press.

830
00:39:15,476 --> 00:39:17,410
(sighs) You're right.

831
00:39:20,614 --> 00:39:27,453
You know, I was reading
about these murals in Sienna.

832
00:39:27,454 --> 00:39:30,490
And one of them
showed good government.

833
00:39:30,491 --> 00:39:33,626
People happy.

834
00:39:33,627 --> 00:39:35,895
Buildings going up.

835
00:39:35,896 --> 00:39:38,064
Courts making good decisions.

836
00:39:38,065 --> 00:39:43,202
And on the opposite wall
was bad government.

837
00:39:43,203 --> 00:39:45,505
It was the same people,
but they were...

838
00:39:45,506 --> 00:39:46,739
They were unhappy,

839
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,408
the courts were making
bad decisions.

840
00:39:48,409 --> 00:39:54,047
It occurred to me
that it only works

841
00:39:54,048 --> 00:39:56,816
if people step up...

842
00:39:56,817 --> 00:40:00,153
If you make the sacrifice.

843
00:40:00,154 --> 00:40:01,254
Look, I was just

844
00:40:01,255 --> 00:40:05,958
an okay state's attorney,
nothing special.

845
00:40:05,959 --> 00:40:09,262
But I want to be a great one.

846
00:40:09,263 --> 00:40:13,132
And I can't do it without you.

847
00:40:15,602 --> 00:40:17,336
I don't want the kids involved.

848
00:40:17,337 --> 00:40:18,504
They won't be.

849
00:40:18,505 --> 00:40:20,506
And I want to work.

850
00:40:20,507 --> 00:40:24,477
I want you to work.

851
00:40:37,925 --> 00:40:39,959
(clearing throat)

852
00:41:00,314 --> 00:41:02,582
A little more than a year ago,

853
00:41:02,583 --> 00:41:04,217
I stood at this podium

854
00:41:04,218 --> 00:41:07,220
and apologized to the public
and to my family

855
00:41:07,221 --> 00:41:11,257
about a personal failure.
(phone ringing)

856
00:41:11,258 --> 00:41:13,559
I made a very bad mistake.

857
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,162
I betrayed my marital vows.

858
00:41:16,163 --> 00:41:17,330
Hello. Will?

859
00:41:17,331 --> 00:41:19,232
Alicia, hi.

860
00:41:19,233 --> 00:41:20,266
Where are you?

861
00:41:20,267 --> 00:41:21,334
Peter's press conference.

862
00:41:21,335 --> 00:41:23,269
Is everything all right?

863
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:25,171
Yes.

864
00:41:25,172 --> 00:41:27,907
I was just thinking-
I don't want to go through life

865
00:41:27,908 --> 00:41:29,542
and think something
didn't happen

866
00:41:29,543 --> 00:41:31,210
just because
I didn't make myself clear.

867
00:41:31,211 --> 00:41:32,545
I can't hear you.

868
00:41:33,947 --> 00:41:37,016
I said I want
to make something clear.

869
00:41:37,017 --> 00:41:38,551
Hold on.

870
00:41:38,552 --> 00:41:40,019
PETER:
All those charges were dropped.

871
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,555
That puts me back
where I belong.

872
00:41:43,857 --> 00:41:45,625
Okay, I just need to say it.

873
00:41:45,626 --> 00:41:47,727
We've been up and down,
back and forth,

874
00:41:47,728 --> 00:41:50,062
and I look at you, Alicia,

875
00:41:50,063 --> 00:41:51,297
and I think that...
Will...

876
00:41:51,298 --> 00:41:53,766
No, I just need to say this.
No.

877
00:41:53,767 --> 00:41:55,735
Show me the plan.

878
00:41:55,736 --> 00:41:57,203
The what?

879
00:41:57,204 --> 00:41:58,771
The plan.

880
00:41:58,772 --> 00:42:00,306
I get the romance.

881
00:42:00,307 --> 00:42:01,374
I need a plan.

882
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:04,010
Not everything needs a plan.

883
00:42:04,011 --> 00:42:05,845
Everything that matters does.

884
00:42:05,846 --> 00:42:08,247
I have two kids that mean
the world to me.

885
00:42:08,248 --> 00:42:09,849
I have the press.

886
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:10,817
They're just waiting

887
00:42:10,818 --> 00:42:11,951
for a whiff of a new scandal.

888
00:42:11,952 --> 00:42:13,386
And I have a husband.

889
00:42:13,387 --> 00:42:17,023
Justice is what this job
should be about.

890
00:42:17,024 --> 00:42:19,625
So if you want to cut
through all that noise,

891
00:42:19,626 --> 00:42:21,294
then show me a plan.

892
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,731
Poetry is easy.

893
00:42:25,732 --> 00:42:27,333
It's the parent-teacher
conferences that are hard.

894
00:42:27,334 --> 00:42:28,367
Alicia, come on.

895
00:42:28,368 --> 00:42:30,136
I have to go now.
Come on.

896
00:42:30,137 --> 00:42:33,439
I... Okay.

897
00:42:36,009 --> 00:42:40,413
<i>PETER: Now I realize that
I cannot do this alone.</i>

898
00:42:40,414 --> 00:42:43,850
With your support, I hope to
become the state's attorney

899
00:42:43,851 --> 00:42:45,384
of Cook County once again.

900
00:42:45,385 --> 00:42:47,420
It won't be easy,
but it's necessary.

901
00:42:47,421 --> 00:42:49,088
You're going to make
my life harder.

902
00:42:49,089 --> 00:42:51,390
PETER: Change it we
can, change it we must,

903
00:42:51,391 --> 00:42:55,761
because Chicago once again
needs a change.

904
00:42:55,762 --> 00:42:58,998
Because Chicago once again
needs a new beginning.

905
00:42:58,999 --> 00:43:00,933
I believe I am that change,

906
00:43:00,934 --> 00:43:03,803
and I believe
that I am that new beginning.

907
00:43:03,804 --> 00:43:04,704
Thank you for listening.

908
00:43:04,705 --> 00:43:06,973
(cheering and applause)

909
00:43:12,179 --> 00:43:14,413
(reporters clamoring)

910
00:43:14,414 --> 00:43:15,581
Alicia.
