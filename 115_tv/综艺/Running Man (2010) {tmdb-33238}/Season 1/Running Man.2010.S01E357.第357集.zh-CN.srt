2
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,360
No.

3
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,600
I have too much work today.

4
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,970
Come see me when I ask nicely.

5
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,700
It's rude to disobey your boss.

6
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,410
Come see me now.
I'm hanging up.

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,390
You've just been promoted.

8
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,830
as my woman.

9
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,120
Hey, Park Dong Pal!

10
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,880
You stop right there!

11
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,810
Hey!

12
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,450
Are you okay?

13
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,280
Damn it. Hey Park Dong Pal!

14
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,940
You bastard.

15
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,160
Because of you

16
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,090
I went through hell, you bastard.

17
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,600
Tell me the truth.

18
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,070
I said I didn't do it.

19
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,830
Why are you asking the same question?

20
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,880
You know Jong Sik, don't you?

21
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,020
He told me everything.

22
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,060
You bragged to him while
drinking with him.

23
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,040
And then you bought your girlfriend
a fancy bag, didn't you?

24
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,260
You stabbed President Cho and...

25
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,100
you bought it with the money
you got in return, right?

26
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,500
About that bag, I
didn't buy it for her.

27
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:55,480
Where do you think you are
to lie like that, huh?

28
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,930
Where do you think you
are to act like a cop?

29
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,820
Why are you pretending to be a cop?

30
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,340
You be quiet.

31
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,140
Was it you who stabbed President Cho?

32
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,290
No.

33
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,920
The day before the accident, you
asked Byung Goo for a fillet knife.

34
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,490
How are you going to explain that, huh?

35
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,740
Can't you keep it down?

36
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,140
I'm the cop here.

37
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,500
He's the cop.

38
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,040
Be quiet.

39
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,040
Hey.

40
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,700
Explain.

41
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,420
Explain what?

42
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:28,190
Explain why you asked Byung
Goo for a fillet knife.

43
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,600
Sir, it was just...

44
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,040
you bragged to Jong Sik while drinking.

45
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,900
Shall I go and interrogate him?

46
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,150
How did you afford to buy your
girlfriend that luxury bag?

47
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,740
Tell the truth.

48
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,300
The truth will come out
during the investigation.

49
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,910
Anything else?

50
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,030
<i>[Wanted, murder suspect]</i>

51
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,280
Hey.

52
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,990
It's too early for that.

53
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,750
I brought you the real culprit.

54
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,900
If I had done it

55
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,440
would I be crazy enough to do that?

56
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,970
We will know for sure after
further investigation.

57
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,530
Gosh, it is not me.

58
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:24,140
It's been years since I stopped
associating with those people.

59
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,230
That's what you claim.

60
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,400
But what I believe is that...

61
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,610
once a trash, always a trash.

62
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,700
You answer my calls.

63
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,260
You are still under surveillance.

64
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,450
Don't take it down.

65
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,540
What is keeping Dong Suk so busy
that he can't attend the meeting?

66
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,670
He might have his personal matters.

67
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,960
Rude bastard.

68
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,850
Hello?

69
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,630
Hospital?

70
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,270
Code Blue.

71
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,860
<i>Dr. Lee Chung Won from cardiology</i>

72
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,860
<i>Please report to the
emergency room immediately.</i>

73
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:36,590
<i>Redirecting your call...</i>

74
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,880
He's had a heart transplant.

75
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,720
I know that.

76
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,810
What's his status?

77
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,330
His heartbeat is slowing down and...

78
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,600
his blood pressure is low.

79
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,090
His pulse is lower than 20% and...

80
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,600
he will be going in to an arrest.

81
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,920
His heart...

82
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,000
We will give up on his heart.

83
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:31,540
Dong Suk.

84
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,500
How did it go?

85
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,590
With this heart, it may be difficult.

86
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,490
What?

87
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,170
For now, the machine
is keeping him alive.

88
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,100
What should we do now?

89
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,060
He will need a new heart.

90
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,700
Then find it now.

91
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,640
It's just that...

92
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,430
Right now...

93
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,040
We will contact centers
for organ donation first.

94
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,960
Why do we need to go
through all those steps?

95
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,500
You know who he is, don't you?

96
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,990
He is Kang Dong Suk.

97
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,700
He's Kang Dong Suk of Hyun Sung Group.

98
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,700
I know that, ma'am.

99
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,030
But this is about a life.

100
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:15,030
Money or power can't
influence this procedure.

101
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,030
We don't need such things.

102
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:20,480
No matter what, just do it now.

103
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,090
Get out!

104
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:31,590
Get out, you bastard.

105
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,890
When are you going to start
acting like a human being?

106
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,760
When, when?

107
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,270
if you're going to live like that...

108
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,790
Why are you doing this?

109
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,160
It was all misunderstanding.

110
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,520
I didn't do anything wrong.

111
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,240
If you didn't do anything wrong

112
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,950
why are the police looking for you?

113
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,570
You must have done
something crazy again.

114
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,890
Isn't that why?

115
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,070
They found the real culprit.

116
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,070
The police won't come
looking for me again.

117
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,450
I'm serious.

118
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:58,380
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

119
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,880
Why didn't you tell me sooner then?

120
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,640
You didn't contact me
for a month now and...

121
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,940
you show up now?

122
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,330
I was chasing after that culprit.

123
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,990
Why were you chasing
after that culprit?

124
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,060
What are you, a cop?

125
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,290
Damn it.

126
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:16,500
Who else is going to take care of me?

127
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,080
The only way was to find him myself
and deliver him to the police.

128
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,080
So there won't be any
other problems, right?

129
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,240
That's right.

130
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,370
I gave him the evidence
and the witness too.

131
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,010
They won't be saying anything else.

132
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,170
Man!

133
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,630
While trying to catch that guy

134
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:35,540
I couldn't even drink for a month.

135
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,870
Wait.

136
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:41,970
Wow.

137
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:45,210
Mom, you are the only
one who cares about me.

138
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,740
I'm not giving it to you
because I care about you.

139
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,000
I worry that you'll make a scene
if you drink on empty stomach.

140
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,380
What customers are you talking about?

141
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,350
I will have Dae Suk over
and drink with him.

142
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,970
He's at the hospital now.

143
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,760
Hospital?

144
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,800
Why?

145
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,390
So?

146
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,700
There is nothing we can do right now

147
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,020
except wait.

148
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,020
Yes.

149
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,740
Dr. Lee.

150
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,400
Isn't there anything else we can do?

151
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,480
Only if by chance

152
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,010
there is a donor from your family.

153
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,900
Got it.

154
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,630
There are 57 people
on the waiting list.

155
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,940
57?

156
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,680
Is there any way to cut in?

157
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,540
Who in their right mind
would give up their turn?

158
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,720
Their lives depend on it too.

159
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,640
Shall I look into lists overseas?

160
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,050
Find it within the country first.

161
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,140
Someone in my family.

162
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,470
Someone in your family?

163
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,410
If a family member becomes the donor

164
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,870
the transplant can
be done immediately.

165
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,280
But still...

166
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,590
If there is no donor in my family

167
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,080
I can make someone
become my family member.

168
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:09,110
Isn't there a chance that someone like
Dong Suk could exist somewhere?

169
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,880
Bring him to me, no
matter what it takes.

170
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:18,140
Even if you have to kill him.

171
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,860
Dae Suk.

172
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,860
Ji Hyuk.

173
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,590
How did you know?

174
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,590
Man.

175
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,920
When your father passed away

176
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,050
you should've called me first.

177
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,270
You were nowhere to be found.

178
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,880
That's right.

179
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,340
I'm sorry I've been busy.

180
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,840
- Is he your father?
- Yes.

181
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,000
How come there aren't many
people at the funeral?

182
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,810
I'm a bit hungry, so...

183
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:54,650
can I have Yukgaejang or something?

184
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,940
Excuse me.

185
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,070
How much?

186
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,400
About the records at all the
hospitals in the country

187
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,160
I've already sent them to you.

188
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,690
Even all the DNA records at
the prosecution's office

189
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:19,770
I will send them as soon as I get them.

190
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:23,600
We have to find a match
as soon as possible.

191
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,860
Please find a match.

192
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,860
Definitely.

193
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,260
Gosh.

194
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,850
I feel lousy.

195
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,940
- Why?
- Isn't that obvious?

196
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,900
My father passed away.

197
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,090
He didn't do much for you.

198
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,680
You said it was better
not having him around.

199
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,880
I was just saying that.

200
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,370
Even if he was a lousy father

201
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,370
between parents and kids

202
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,490
there is something you
don't know about.

203
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:58,420
What do you mean I don't know?

204
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,110
Parents should do their
job to be called parents.

205
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,700
When they don't do anything for you

206
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,590
is it okay for them to
give birth and be done?

207
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:09,880
Parents become parents
when they provide and raise the child.

208
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,080
But if your father shows up

209
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,940
you would feel differently, too.

210
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,310
No way.

211
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:20,020
I would totally ignore him.

212
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,060
Wait and see.

213
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,170
How shameless does he have to be
to show up after all these years?

214
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,700
But still...

215
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:33,660
it's better to have him around.

216
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,250
Father.

217
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,960
I'm sorry.

218
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,820
Like other people

219
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,820
you should have waited for your son to
send you on a trip abroad, before you died.

220
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:06,370
Hey, Dae Suk!

221
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,130
Wait a second!

222
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,110
Your father...

223
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,440
Ji Hyuk.

224
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,400
Will that be able to go overseas?

225
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,430
America?

226
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,140
Why would President Kang
all of a sudden?

227
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,920
Do you have to know
the reason, So Mi Ra?

228
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,290
Even his short local trips

229
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,200
I've been handling them.

230
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,180
I've even packed his suitcases.

231
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,150
But without even telling me

232
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,830
the reason why he's left
for America suddenly...

233
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:07,340
You know how they work.

234
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,480
They do whatever they want
and do it whenever.

235
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,480
When we work for people like them

236
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,420
we can just do what they want us to do.

237
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,930
If he wants to swim across the
Pacific to get to America

238
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:20,140
we get him the best swimsuit
and the best life vest.

239
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,590
We don't think about the
reason nor need to.

240
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:27,840
Then do you know how I can contact him?

241
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,700
- Do you really want to know?
- Yes.

242
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,440
I have to know.

243
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,710
Then do a search on the Internet.

244
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:36,920
If you search a female actress who
left for America around the same time

245
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,100
then you will find the answer
that you're looking for.

246
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,530
Sir.

247
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:45,940
The hospital just sent you the records.

248
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,400
Okay.

249
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,540
You may go.

250
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,030
Bingo.

251
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,130
Ji Hyuk.

252
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,470
From a whole cow

253
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:43,250
this is such precious meat that
we can get only this much.

254
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,820
Why would you bring this
precious meat to me?

255
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,180
You should go sell it instead.

256
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,930
You sent my father on a trip overseas.

257
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:54,560
Did I do that for free food?

258
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,120
About the beef shank
in the refrigerator

259
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:00,550
Man, I was saving it
for something else.

260
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,040
You stop right there.

261
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,300
Hey.

262
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,420
I was paying for the beef.

263
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,600
I was going to give him
the money for the beef.

264
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,000
How much is it?

265
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,290
Really?

266
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:13,970
How much can this beef possibly be?

267
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,970
30,000 won.

268
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,070
I will give you the
money after I finish.

269
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,380
You have to pay me, okay?

270
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,870
I was surprised he'd do that.

271
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,970
Hello?

272
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:47,330
No, I have to start work soon.

273
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:50,480
What about tonight...

274
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,370
What?

275
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:54,880
Is it a long distance?

276
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,880
Yes, I will be right there.

277
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,110
Kim Ji Hyuk.

278
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,790
Long time.

279
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,780
When did you get  out?

280
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,300
A while ago.

281
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,110
I've been busy settling, so...

282
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,920
I haven't been in touch.

283
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,660
By the way

284
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,920
I heard that you took
Dong Pal to the station.

285
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,760
That...

286
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,230
Is he one of your guys?

287
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,510
It's so strange.

288
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:22,320
We always get tangled like this, huh?

289
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,930
We must have been enemies
in our previous lives.

290
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,510
So what is it that you want to say?

291
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,110
Say it now, so I can go.

292
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,830
As his boss

293
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,240
I can't let this go, you know.

294
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,650
We all know that it was you who did it.

295
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,890
Bastard.

296
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,070
Are you threatening me now?

297
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,710
Do you want to die?

298
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,550
It's okay.

299
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,490
In front of my guys

300
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,930
you can't talk to me that way.

301
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,370
Give me a break.

302
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:52,020
Hey, if you want to keep them around

303
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,930
learn how to treat your
ex-boss with respect.

304
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:58,240
What's with the eyes?

305
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,890
Plus.

306
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,600
I'm not in that business
any more, so...

307
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,270
don't act like you know
me from now on, okay?

308
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,580
It's embarrassing.

309
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,640
You left this life?

310
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,270
Gosh, it's too bad.

311
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:20,280
He was once the best in this business.

312
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,770
Yes, sir.

313
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,380
Kim Ji Hyuk?

314
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,380
Taxi!

315
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,250
I know him very well.

316
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,510
Kim Ji Hyuk.

317
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,820
Here.

318
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,840
The buses in this area run late, right?

319
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,450
There are no buses here.

320
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,960
Ah, really?

321
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,550
Then how long does it take
to walk to the bus stop?

322
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,520
I don't know.

323
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,930
I've never been on a bus.

324
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,520
Taxis come out here though, right?

325
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,530
Why do I have to care about
how you're going to get back?

326
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,760
If you're going to be whiny about it,
I can call somebody else.

327
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,120
It's irritating.

328
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,430
What bad manners.

329
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,640
What did you say?

330
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,150
Ah...

331
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,660
I wasn't talking to you.

332
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,520
I was reminded of my
sister who left home.

333
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,080
She looks very much like you.

334
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,320
When she talks, she
also had bad manners.

335
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,360
That's a coincidence.

336
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,050
Pardon?

337
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:45,080
You look like my brother
who left home too.

338
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,770
He didn't know his place and...

339
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:47,990
he was sarcastic.

340
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,160
You guys are very similar.

341
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,870
I wonder what he's up to.

342
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:54,950
At his best, he would
be a substitute driver.

343
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,190
What are you doing?

344
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:29,030
Sorry but I can't be caught
by the police right now.

345
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:31,760
Stop the nonsense and stop the car.

346
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,940
Hey!

347
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,870
Stop the car!

348
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,770
You've been drinking, haven't you?

349
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:08,070
You did that because you were
driving under the influence, right?

350
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,840
Like I told you earlier

351
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,070
I'll be in trouble if I get
arrested by the police now.

352
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,370
What do I do?

353
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,530
I don't give a damn.

354
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:17,810
A charge for an attempted
murder will be added.

355
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:18,980
Hey.

356
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,820
Lady, no ma'am!

357
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,190
Damn it!

358
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,850
Are you okay?

359
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,250
I'm okay, so just go.

360
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,350
Don't make a scene.

361
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,860
- Just go.
- Okay.

362
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,150
Over there.

363
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,570
What garbage.

364
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,840
Think before you act.

365
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:24,050
You and the garbage are here alone now.

366
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,160
Wash it off.

367
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,920
So you won't smell like garbage.

368
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:57,150
Call the hospital.

369
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:00,010
to get the trash out.

370
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,390
The surgery would be possible.

371
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,680
I understand.

372
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,270
Get rid of him.

373
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:05,010
Doctor, we have an emergency.

374
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:08,040
Page him quickly.

375
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,030
Last night

376
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:12,960
there was a 31 years old
male with a head trauma.

377
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,590
There is no sign of other injuries.

378
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,680
Due to the head injury

379
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,250
We suspect encephalitis at this time.

380
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,580
Currently, he's not able
to breathe on his own.

381
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:24,140
There is a chance of brain death.

382
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:37,020
Good work. You may leave.

383
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,470
Yes, it's been confirmed.

384
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,730
Thank you.

385
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,420
Oh my, good to have you.

386
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:07,610
I know how busy you are.

387
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,470
Good to have you here.

388
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,930
Thank you.

389
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:17,080
Okay. Good work.

390
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,520
Is everything okay?

391
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,150
Everything is going to be okay.

392
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,790
So please smile a little.

393
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:27,500
Is it easy as that?

394
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,880
I will go first.

395
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,570
Jin Ah.

396
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:33,040
What is it?

397
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,460
Are you leaving already?

398
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,710
I'm sorry, but something
urgent came up.

399
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:38,660
I'm sorry.

400
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,570
Myung Ho, what are you doing?

401
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,190
You should take Jin Ah home.

402
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,300
Sure.

403
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,500
Hey.

404
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,450
I know it's forced, but...

405
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,590
can you at least pretend?

406
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,260
You weren't even trying.

407
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,690
You knew I was pretending?

408
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,870
President Kang and Mrs. Kang.

409
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:01,170
you guys look younger
every time I see you.

410
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,170
Do we?

411
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:04,360
Don't get too much younger.

412
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,540
I will have a lot of
catching up to do.

413
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:10,890
When Myung Ho and Jin Ah get married

414
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,650
I will be the only one who
will look old at the wedding.

415
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,860
Oh my, you're too funny.

416
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,910
President Kang, it's been a long time.

417
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,650
Ah.

418
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:25,030
What brings you here, Prosecutor Chang?

419
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,180
It's just that...

420
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,250
I was working in the other province.

421
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:30,180
I managed to come back
to Seoul some time ago.

422
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:33,260
So now I get invitations
here and there.

423
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,880
I see.

424
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,790
Anyway, thanks to you...

425
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:40,200
I rested well in the other province.

426
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,710
I see.

427
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:44,420
I will pay you a visit soon.

428
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:47,380
When someone does something nice to me

429
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:51,730
it's my nature to carve it in
to my skull and never forget.

430
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:54,160
Then...

431
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:24,260
<i>So Mi Ra.</i>

432
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:31,640
Sir.

433
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,460
I told you not to do this at work.

434
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,780
Sorry.

435
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,630
Your view from behind was beautiful.

436
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,390
Finish your work and...

437
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,930
go wait at the place we usually go.

438
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,170
I will meet you there.

439
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:45,360
Can we just go together?

440
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,490
Well, not yet, Mi Ra.

441
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:51,750
Are you that scared to reveal
that you're seeing me?

442
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,750
Yes, I'm scared.

443
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,010
especially my mom.

444
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:56,620
If she finds out that we're dating

445
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,690
she will take away my title and...

446
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:59,690
take me out of our family tree.

447
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:01,020
If that happens

448
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,480
the wife of the president
that you longed to become...

449
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,110
will disappear instantly.

450
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,770
You're saying that I've wanted
to get that title, huh?

451
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:13,250
Then the reason why
I'm dating you is...

452
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,990
you're saying I purposely
tried to hit on you, huh?

453
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,360
Wait.

454
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,990
That wasn't it?

455
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,430
Gosh, I'm crazy.

456
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:24,060
When I knew that there would
be such a misunderstanding...

457
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,730
Then I will set you free.

458
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,810
I don't need to be the
wife of the president.

459
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,300
Are you sure?

460
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,790
Can I really go?

461
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,430
Did you really mean that?

462
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,890
You really meant that, huh?

463
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,990
Where is that man?

464
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,760
Bring that man here right now!

465
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,600
I'm sorry.

466
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,510
We've called him so many times, but...

467
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,190
he's not answering.

468
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,350
Get in touch with that man somehow.

469
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,770
There are so many things
he's responsible for.

470
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:04,300
If not, you'll have to
take full responsibility.

471
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:07,730
I will be here until he shows up.

472
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:09,890
Get him over here now.

473
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:12,350
What in the world did he do?

474
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:15,290
How could you send him as my driver
when he was drunk?

475
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:18,720
I had never been so close
to death in my life.

476
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,060
Does he think he's Tom Cruise
or something?

477
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:23,540
He was engaged in a car
chase with the police.

478
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,580
He knew that I was
going to look for him.

479
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,120
That's why he went into hiding.

480
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,120
I will definitely find him.

481
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,410
Should I call the police
and press charges?

482
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:42,230
Are you crazy?

483
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:45,230
I wouldn't want to go to the police
station because of some loser.

484
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,190
Jin Ah.

485
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:51,500
What's your real reason
for trying to find him?

486
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,480
Are you really trying
to get his apology?

487
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:00,670
Gosh, I'm tired after all
that screaming in that dump.

488
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:04,750
Wake me up when we get home.

489
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,300
Go in.

490
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,040
Thank you.

491
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:31,810
My brother left without saying
anything to you, either?

492
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:32,680
Yes.

493
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,970
So are you disappointed?

494
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:36,910
No, it's not that.

495
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,400
Because he disappeared suddenly

496
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,640
I just have a lot of
things to take care of.

497
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,600
I hope you understand.

498
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,180
He's never focused as you know.

499
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:48,090
Good night.

500
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,900
Hey.

501
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,510
Do you want to fly that from there?

502
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:22,340
I want to see if it can come up here.

503
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:25,470
Try.

504
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,190
<i>Dong Suk, your tutor is here.</i>

505
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:38,070
Okay, mom. Wait a second.

506
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,130
Is it broken?

507
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,130
Sorry. What can I do?

508
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,830
It's okay.

509
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,830
I asked you to do that.

510
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:49,060
You can throw it away.

511
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,320
If we fix it, it might fly again.

512
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,950
Then can you fix it and fly it again?

513
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,640
<i>Dong Suk.</i>

514
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,550
Okay, I'm coming.

515
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,630
Bye. Better luck next time.

516
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,220
Soon he'll be pronounced
brain dead and...

517
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,710
when we get his heart out,
we will perform the transplant.

518
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,450
- Get ready.
- Yes, sir.

519
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:09,450
If we make any mistakes

520
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:12,520
we all won't be able to
work at this hospital.

521
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,250
- You all know that, right?
- Yes, sir.

522
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,200
Thank you.

523
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,960
Why are you thanking me?

524
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,720
He's not just your son, but mine too.

525
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,900
Dong Suk will come back to
the way he used to be, right?

526
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:33,570
Just thinking about it makes me happy.

527
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:36,900
Thinking about seeing
my son smile again...

528
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:40,360
Even if you love it, try
not to show it too much.

529
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,360
The man who will be
pronounced brain dead...

530
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,680
he's your son on paper too.

531
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:48,710
Ah, that's right.

532
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,810
This is the same test
done six hours ago.

533
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:55,570
There is no pupillary
reflex or brain activity.

534
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:58,650
He's maintaining the flat
electroencephalogram.

535
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,840
He's been checked out for hemophilia.

536
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,540
There is no chance of
spontaneous respiration.

537
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,640
Kim Il Tae and two
others at cardiothoracic

538
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:06,870
surgery at Hyun Sung hospital

539
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:09,530
we pronounce him brain dead.

540
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:12,270
If any of your family members
object this decision

541
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:14,130
you can ask for a reexamination.

542
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:17,210
Do you object?

543
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,310
At 15:30 on April 15th, 2014

544
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:29,290
we pronounce Kang Ji Hyuk brain dead.

545
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:33,150
<i>Even though I walk through
the valley of darkness</i>

546
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:35,220
<i>I will fear no evil,
for you are with me;</i>

547
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:37,320
<i>your rod and your
staff, they comfort me.</i>

548
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:43,040
<i>You prepare a table before me
in the presence of my enemies.</i>

549
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:47,660
<i>Even though your body stops breathing</i>

550
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:51,590
<i>the body God gave you</i>

551
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:56,140
<i>will be shared with other
unfortunate souls.</i>

552
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,380
We will now perform the
transplant on Kang Ji Hyuk.

553
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,470
Scalpel.

554
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:15,970
Sir, hold on.

555
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:18,080
- I notice his oculo movement.
- What?

556
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,190
Confirm it.

557
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:24,070
Does he show light reflex?

558
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,310
No.

559
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:26,280
What was that?

560
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,020
I'm serious. I saw something earlier...

561
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:37,520
He's already been
pronounced brain dead.

562
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,780
Medically, he's same as dead.

563
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,090
Start the surgery now.

564
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,190
Suction.

565
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,750
Are you not going to do anything?

566
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,750
Aren't you going to
start gauze packing?

567
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,150
Sir.

568
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,950
This can be considered as
a sign of nearing death.

569
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:10,000
So we will start the operation.

570
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,690
Sir.

571
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:19,020
This is not right.

572
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:43,260
The surgery is over already?

573
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,180
I agree.

574
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:47,180
How could you finish this fast?

575
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:51,210
The patient, Kang Ji Hyuk
has come back to life.

576
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:56,630
Who came back to life?

577
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,420
Kang Ji Hyuk.

578
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,490
What are you talking about?

579
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:01,050
He was already pronounced brain dead.

580
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:01,820
During surgery

581
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,560
his brainwave resumed.

582
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,340
There was a problem in
pronouncing him brain dead.

583
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,820
Then...

584
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,500
What's going to happen to Dong Suk?

585
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,330
Dong Suk won't be able
to have the surgery?

586
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,100
He can't.

587
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,210
Dr. Lee.

588
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:24,690
Something must be wrong.

589
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:26,650
It was all over.

590
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:27,970
It was already confirmed.

591
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:30,550
You can just go perform surgery.

592
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,320
There is some misunderstanding.

593
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,210
It was the machine error.

594
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:36,350
Please.

595
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,660
Please go back and try.

596
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,470
Please go back and perform surgery now.

597
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,610
Ma'am.

598
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:42,560
In a situation like this

599
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,400
if I put a scalpel on his chest

600
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,430
I will be a murderer.

601
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,230
Dong Suk.

602
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,840
- Dong Suk.
- Ma'am.

603
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,080
- Dong Suk.
- Honey.

604
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,140
How is my wife doing?

605
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,680
She is doing okay.

606
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,940
She just needs to rest.

607
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,710
How about that guy?

608
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:19,220
He's in the recovery room.

609
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:26,600
How did you let this happen?

610
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,550
I'm sorry.

611
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:29,760
This was a case of 1 in 10,000.

612
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,140
It was a miracle...

613
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,760
A miracle?

614
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,020
I'm sorry.

615
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:39,130
Is there a chance he might
become brain dead again?

616
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:40,320
It's not entirely impossible, but...

617
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,660
no one knows for sure at this point.

618
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,920
There is nothing we can do
now that things are complicated.

619
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,710
Look into the lists overseas.

620
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:48,000
We'll always consider him as an option.

621
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Yes, I understand.

622
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,340
And don't let this get out.

623
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,620
Act like nothing happened.

624
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,620
Yes.

625
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:05,320
Ji Hyuk hasn't been here either?

626
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,590
No.

627
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:08,950
What happened to him?

628
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,570
His cell phone is switched off too.

629
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,570
Why do you worry about him?

630
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:14,100
Is this his first time doing this?

631
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:17,180
No, something is not right this time.

632
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,790
When he went in hiding in the past

633
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,480
he just wouldn't answer the phone.

634
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,540
He never switched off his cell phone.

635
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:27,870
He must have broken it
during a fight somewhere.

636
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:31,070
When he comes home

637
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,290
please let me know.

638
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,860
Don't bother.

639
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:37,360
I will sever my ties
with him this time.

640
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,680
If he calls you, tell him.

641
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,600
Tell him not to even think about
setting his foot in this place again.

642
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:46,480
Are you not worried? For real?

643
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:50,010
Why would I worry about him?

644
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:53,370
Are we related by blood or what?

645
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:56,620
We have no relationship, whatsoever.

646
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:22,970
Gosh, where can he be,
and doing what?

647
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,580
On 15th of this month

648
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,700
at the party for our new family members

649
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,310
For the appetizer, foie gras.

650
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:59,230
For the main course

651
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:01,720
Japanese Wagyu and truffles.

652
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,800
For wine, Monte Verde

653
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,090
it should be served at the table
for the president's family only.

654
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:08,670
For the rest, have
something cheaper ready.

655
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:10,240
About the foie gras

656
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,750
only refrigerated foie gras
for the president's family.

657
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,940
For the rest, we'll go
with frozen foie gras.

658
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,600
For all the other parties,
use this as a standard.

659
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,370
Wait.

660
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,710
At the president's house

661
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,230
there is a problem with the air
freshener in the bathrooms.

662
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:23,290
The French company of the
product went bankrupt.

663
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,730
We don't have any in stock.

664
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:25,950
What should I do?

665
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,660
Why are you bringing it up now?

666
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,660
Don't you know how sensitive
Mrs. Kang is about the scent?

667
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:30,600
I'm sorry.

668
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:34,180
Right now, send the French headquarter
samples of fragrances she likes.

669
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:36,980
Tell them to send air fresheners
that are close to that scent.

670
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,820
I will.

671
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:39,720
And...

672
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,160
Go over to the hotel
where we are having

673
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:42,630
our founding
ceremony next month.

674
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:45,760
Check their cleanliness
and reservation lists.

675
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:49,630
Can I help you?

676
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:51,500
Ah, it's...

677
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,730
I heard someone was looking
for a machine in China.

678
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:56,170
Hold on.

679
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:58,160
And on the whole fifteenth
floor at the hotel

680
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,320
make sure no one is allowed
except the president's family members.

681
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,320
Yes, sir.

682
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,760
Next, we have an issue about the
president's house cleaning.

683
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,670
I was going to bring
it up to Manager So.

684
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:11,080
Mrs. Kang...

685
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:16,800
We have to find the matching part.

686
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,820
Something that matches ours here.

687
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:23,960
Sure.

688
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,720
Anything you forgot to mention?

689
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,230
I think we've covered it all.

690
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,230
Then let's wrap it up.

691
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:30,990
Good work.

692
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:33,680
Due to President Kang
Dong Suk's car damage

693
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,490
the car service contacted us, so...

694
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:36,830
can you go over to check?

695
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:38,300
It might be better to scrap it.

696
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,770
Sure.

697
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:40,910
Hold on.

698
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:44,460
What did you say happened
to President Kang Dong Suk's car?

699
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:46,130
It might have been in an accident.

700
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:48,410
- We will take care of it...
- No.

701
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:50,680
I will go take care of it myself.

702
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,680
Tell me where the service center is.

703
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:18,640
What do you want me
to do with that car?

704
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,770
Do you want it to be fixed?

705
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:23,910
When the accident happened

706
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:25,500
Were you there yourself?

707
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,490
Yes, I was.

708
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:29,470
Do you know what
happened to the driver?

709
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:32,630
Well, I only saw him
carried to the ambulance.

710
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:35,040
Nothing happened to him, did it?

711
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,660
I'm sorry, but...

712
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,300
about the accident

713
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,810
I was asked not to say anything, so...

714
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:42,800
I can't tell you anything further.

715
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,770
Was he still alive at least?

716
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:47,970
Pardon?

717
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:49,630
Just tell me that only.

718
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:52,140
whether he was alive or not.

719
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:55,320
He was alive.

720
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,310
when I was there at least.

721
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:03,000
Thank you.

722
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,710
What do you want to do with the car?

723
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:46,500
It's okay.

724
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,180
He will be okay.

725
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:51,370
He should be okay.

726
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,870
Hi, Manager Do.

727
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:14,110
Where are you now, So Ra?

728
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:16,110
I'm out at the moment.

729
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:19,060
Go to Hyun Sung hospital now.

730
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,470
What is it?

731
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:23,330
In the VIP room

732
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:25,070
find a man named Kang Ji Hyuk
who is not conscious.

733
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:28,600
Report to me everything
that's happening to him.

734
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,180
Kang Ji Hyuk?

735
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:33,720
Who is he?

736
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,800
Don't second guess the
work you're given.

737
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,490
Don't you know the creed?

738
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:42,320
Yes, understood.

739
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:45,280
Manager Do.

740
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,860
About President Kang Dong Suk

741
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,610
is it true that he's gone to America?

742
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:53,160
He got on a plane.

743
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,040
That's all I know.

744
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,130
Don't get sidetracked
with some nonsense.

745
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:00,710
Do as you're told.

746
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:39,610
Are you his guardian?

747
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:42,420
Yes.

748
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:44,430
You must be thrilled.

749
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:45,570
Pardon?

750
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:46,940
After being pronounced brain dead

751
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:50,570
it was very rare that
he came back to life.

752
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:53,380
Besides, his recovery is very fast too.

753
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:56,630
Ah, his hand moved earlier too.

754
00:47:56,630 --> 00:47:59,670
I can only explain this as a miracle.

755
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:02,900
Is that right?

756
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,690
Among the patients in the VIP rooms

757
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:11,820
by any chance, can you check
if there is Kang Dong Suk?

758
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:15,050
I'm sorry, but we are not
allowed to give you that information.

759
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:17,780
I'm an employee at
Hyun Sung headquarter.

760
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:19,900
You can tell me if he's here or not.

761
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,950
I'm sorry, but I can't.

762
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:26,360
Hello, this is the information
desk at Hyun Sung hospital.

763
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:31,450
Manager Lee.

764
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,640
Uh, what are you doing here?

765
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,470
There is something I
was asked to do here.

766
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:38,360
What brings you here?

767
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:42,040
Well, Madam Choi asked us to
move something here, so...

768
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,480
This is...

769
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,740
Hello, you're from Hyun Sung, right?

770
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:56,610
Yes.

771
00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:58,450
Give it to us. We will move it.

772
00:48:58,450 --> 00:48:59,890
We can carry it.

773
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:00,730
No.

774
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:02,020
Except for the hospital staff

775
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:03,420
no one else is allowed in, so...

776
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:04,410
Give it to us.

777
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:07,020
We will move it for you.

778
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:20,420
Alright then. Thank you.

779
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:24,220
Ah, thank you.

780
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:25,880
- Sir.
- What is it?

781
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,280
I might have exclusive news.

782
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,370
- Exclusive news?
- Yes.

783
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:30,660
Reporter Park called me and...

784
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:32,740
At Financial Supervisory Service

785
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:34,010
according to Prosecutor Chang Won Tae

786
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:35,830
you know that they are trying
to target Hyun Sung, right?

787
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:36,720
I do.

788
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,720
Why is that exclusive news?

789
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,570
When they were investigating
taxes on inheritance

790
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:44,770
they found another son of President
Kang Sung Wook at Hyun Sung.

791
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:46,510
- A son?
- Yes.

792
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:49,070
Other than President Kang Dong
Suk at Hyun Sung Distribution

793
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:51,530
there is another son on
their family registry.

794
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,800
It was recent too.

795
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,640
Is that right?

796
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,760
Find out about him.

797
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,850
We will break that news first, okay?

798
00:49:57,850 --> 00:49:58,890
Sure.

799
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:00,710
Get on it.

800
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:03,140
I was told that he's recovering fast.

801
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:05,140
What should we do?

802
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,140
We are looking into China for now.

803
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:08,630
About that man

804
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:09,530
when he regains his consciousness

805
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:11,390
we will move him to a
different hospital.

806
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:14,750
It's not easy to keep it under
tight control in a big hospital.

807
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:16,410
If the situation becomes a dead end

808
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:18,530
get rid of him.

809
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:21,160
Without a trace.

810
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:31,300
You can hear this, right?

811
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:34,530
This is the Mozart that you like.

812
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:02,470
Yes, I'm at the hospital.

813
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:04,680
I wanted to get some air.

814
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:07,120
Where did you say you were?

815
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:54,040
Dong Suk.

816
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:59,260
Why are you in there?

817
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:05,080
Please open your eyes and tell me.

818
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,560
Will you?

819
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:10,770
Tell me that you're okay.

820
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:14,220
Tell me that you're just fine, huh?

821
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,830
Dong Suk.

822
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:29,310
How is he doing?

823
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:30,900
Not bad.

824
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:33,280
So far.

825
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,730
So far?

826
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:36,340
There is blood circulation, but...

827
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:38,850
he hasn't regained his
consciousness yet.

828
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:40,960
I worry about the after effects.

829
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,510
How long does he have?

830
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:44,640
He will be okay up to a month.

831
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,760
A month...

832
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,890
What about beyond that?

833
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:54,060
It will be difficult to expect
to see him the same way.

834
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:58,540
- You came.
- Yes.

835
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,690
How long do we have to wait?

836
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:03,510
I've been contacting the centers, so...

837
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:05,200
Not an answer like that...

838
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,300
I'm saying take some
immediate action, now.

839
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:10,570
Whether you use that guy
to take his heart out or...

840
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:12,750
Honey.

841
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:15,240
I'm just going crazy. That's why...

842
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,400
Nothing is getting done
here at the hospital.

843
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,120
I'm sorry.

844
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,390
Go home. Dong Suk will hear you.

845
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:21,650
I will do everything I can
to give him that operation.

846
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:25,280
So don't say things without thinking.

847
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:42,180
<i>Go to Hyun Sung Hospital now.</i>

848
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:42,850
<i>In a VIP room</i>

849
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:44,620
find a man named Kang Ji
Hyuk who is unconscious.

850
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:45,760
After being pronounced brain dead

851
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,870
this was very rare to come
back to life like this.

852
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:51,050
Whether you use that man again
to pull out his heart or...

853
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:08,130
Dong Suk.

854
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:10,890
Dong Suk, excuse me!

855
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:13,070
- Excuse me!
- I'm okay.

856
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:15,510
I'm okay.

857
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:18,140
Dong Suk, are you okay?

858
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:21,100
What is it? What happened?

859
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,320
This might happen often.

860
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,600
What I have in here...

861
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,340
it's not mine.

862
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:35,100
Dong Suk.

863
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:38,700
So don't stress me out with anything.

864
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:42,000
I might explode into pieces.

865
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:05,140
Good night.

866
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,140
What is it?

867
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:21,420
What? Why the reporters?

868
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:25,330
Tell the hospital to move his room.

869
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:26,840
Now.

870
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:58,180
- To that side.
- Yes.

871
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:02,430
Over there!

872
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:55,250
<i>No, I have to live.</i>

873
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:56,790
<i>I want to live.</i>

874
00:57:56,790 --> 00:57:59,940
<i>Can somebody grab me?</i>

875
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:01,610
<i>Grab me.</i>

876
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:04,740
<i>Grab me!</i>

877
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:10,030

878
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:12,590
There is nothing to
think about this time.

879
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:13,690
Kill him.

880
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,740
Don't judge the work you're given.

881
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:18,660
I will follow that rule exactly.

882
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:21,120
- You.
- Are you Jin Ah?

883
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:22,880
You were that garbage, right?

884
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,280
There is something wrong with my eyes.

885
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,000
Mom!

886
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,260
Did you get into trouble again?

887
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:28,100
I got into mega trouble.

888
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:30,100
Before you do more

889
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:32,970
Don't worry about him.

890
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:35,660
There is a reason why I
gave him that title.

891
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:39,710
It might be something that
was in the bag that you had.

892
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:42,440
What was your motive?

893
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:45,700
You can just be my lover.

894
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,840
President Kang Sung Wook!

895
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,900
My father was a bastard.
