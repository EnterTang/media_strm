155
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,560
Knowing's not the same as proving.

This case started to consume her.

172
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,020
She started chasing down obscure foreign leads,

00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,340
sometimes punching in a week later.


174
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,460
So the fact she's missing doesn't surprise or worry you?
