1
00:00:02,926 --> 00:00:05,554
什么？这是什么？
What? What is it?

2
00:00:05,595 --> 00:00:07,722
酒烩肉卷。
你知道，填牛肉
It's braciole,
you know, stuffed beef.

3
00:00:07,764 --> 00:00:09,755
真的？酒烩肉卷？
谁做的？
Really? Braciole?
Who made it?

4
00:00:09,799 --> 00:00:11,790
我做的
I did.

5
00:00:14,771 --> 00:00:16,329
试试总可以吧
Just try it.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,665
-你没来点？
-不，一点……
- You're not having any?
- No, I had some...

7
00:00:19,709 --> 00:00:22,405
你知道，给孩子们。
我让孩子们吃了点
you know, with the kids,
I had some with the kids.

8
00:00:22,445 --> 00:00:25,141
哦。
你有什么感觉？
Oh.
How are you feeling?

9
00:00:27,283 --> 00:00:31,447
没下毒，雷。
我要是想杀你，也不是这么杀法
It's not poisoned, Ray. If I wanted
to kill you, I wouldn't do it that way.

10
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,854
那好，我会记录在案的
All right,
that goes in the file.

11
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,801
嘿！
Hey!

12
00:00:45,835 --> 00:00:47,826
-还行吧？
-是的！
- Good?
- Yeah!

13
00:00:47,871 --> 00:00:49,862
是，好极了
Yeah, good.

14
00:00:49,906 --> 00:00:52,136
第二口感觉更好
Even better
the second time

15
00:00:52,175 --> 00:00:54,837
因为舌头没有恐惧了
now that my tongue's
not scared.

16
00:00:56,713 --> 00:00:59,273
-嗯蓿乖乖，真是好极了
-是吗，你真的喜欢？
- Mmm, man, this is great.
- Yeah, you really like it?

17
00:00:59,315 --> 00:01:01,306
很好。
我喜欢。让我接着吃
It's good.
I really do. Let me at it.

18
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:04,650
哦，那真是……
我开心死了！
Oh, that's...
I'm so happy!

19
00:01:04,687 --> 00:01:06,678
哦，看，你坐下了！
Oh, look,
you're sitting down!

20
00:01:06,723 --> 00:01:08,714
哦！
Ooh!

21
00:01:08,758 --> 00:01:12,285
-我成功了！我真的做到了！
-妈咪！
- I did it, huh? I really did it!
- Mommy!

22
00:01:12,328 --> 00:01:14,387
知道了，亲爱的，我这就上来
Yeah, honey, I'll be up
in just a second.

23
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,364
好了，我去浴室帮爱丽穿衣服
Okay, I'm gonna get
Ally out of the bath.

24
00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:19,732
-灶台上还有的是
-留不久了
- There's a lot more on the stove here.
- Not for long.

25
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:31,009
嗯……
Mmm...

26
00:01:40,102 --> 00:01:42,093
嘿，试试这个
Hey, try this.

27
00:01:42,137 --> 00:01:44,128
-这是什么？
-酒烩肉卷
- What is it?
- Braciole.

28
00:01:44,173 --> 00:01:46,334
-酒烩肉卷？
-我来
- Braciole?
- I'm in.

29
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:47,842
-谁做的？
-黛比拉
- Who made it?
- Debra.

30
00:01:47,877 --> 00:01:50,641
我不来了
I'm out.

31
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:52,670
拿这来，雷，
我来试试黛比拉的酒烩肉卷
Here, Ray, I'll try
Debra's braciole.

32
00:01:52,715 --> 00:01:54,979
反正我吃的抗生素够多
I'm filled
with antibiotics.

33
00:01:59,121 --> 00:02:00,588
嗯蓿
Mmm!

34
00:02:00,623 --> 00:02:03,183
是吗？
给我，给我
Yeah?
Gimme gimme.

35
00:02:06,462 --> 00:02:09,124
-老天爷爷！
-明白了？
- Geez, oh Lou!
- See?

36
00:02:09,164 --> 00:02:12,793
那么说的确不错。
不是因为我刚吃过飞机上的东西
So it is good. It's not just me
coming off airline food.

37
00:02:12,835 --> 00:02:14,803
太奇妙了。
我是说，太妙了
It's amazing.
I mean, that is amazing.

38
00:02:14,837 --> 00:02:16,702
你确定是你家的黛比拉做的？
Are you sure
your Debra made this?

39
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:18,468
我知道，我也不相信
I know, I couldn't
believe it either.

40
00:02:18,507 --> 00:02:20,941
-她不知哪搞的菜谱
-菜谱？
- She came up with some recipe.
- Recipe?

41
00:02:20,976 --> 00:02:24,776
-是的，怎么了？
-真正的厨师不需要菜谱
- Yeah, what?
- Real cooks don't need recipes.

42
00:02:26,482 --> 00:02:28,882
我们知道怎么加进
爱和关怀
We know how to add
love and caring

43
00:02:28,918 --> 00:02:32,615
因为任何快乐都比不上做吃的给……
because there's no greater joy
than feeding our...

44
00:02:32,655 --> 00:02:35,681
弗兰克，瞧你的猪相
Frank,
you're a pig.

45
00:02:35,724 --> 00:02:37,521
别吧唧了！
Stop moaning!

46
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:40,892
这么说黛比拉会做饭了
So Debra can
now cook.

47
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,024
雷蒙德彩虹上缺失的那一抹
The missing color
in the Raymond rainbow.

48
00:02:45,301 --> 00:02:47,769
啊哈！
Ah ha ha ha ha!

49
00:02:51,707 --> 00:02:54,005
你该问问黛比拉她是怎么做的
You should ask Debra
how she makes this.

50
00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:00,446
我该问黛比拉？
I should ask Debra?

51
00:03:00,482 --> 00:03:03,542
我该问黛比拉？
I should ask Debra?

52
00:03:03,585 --> 00:03:05,018
给我！
Gimme that!

53
00:03:22,771 --> 00:03:25,797
这个食物有神奇的力量
This food has
magical powers.

54
00:03:28,477 --> 00:03:30,707
我要在脖子上缠点
I'm gonna string some
of this around my neck.

55
00:03:37,386 --> 00:03:39,445
-哈喽
-嘿，安迪
- Hello.
- Hey, Andy.

56
00:03:39,488 --> 00:03:42,048
嘿，黛比，雷在吗？
Hey, Deb,
is Ray here?

57
00:03:42,091 --> 00:03:44,184
不，他不在。
他还没回来
No, he's not home.
No, he's not home yet.

58
00:03:44,226 --> 00:03:45,693
嘿，饿吗？
Hey, you hungry?

59
00:03:45,728 --> 00:03:47,923
哦，当然，我最喜欢吃的了
Oh, sure, I could
always go for something.

60
00:03:47,963 --> 00:03:49,555
我做了点酒烩肉卷。
来尝尝
I made some braciole.
Taste it.

61
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:52,624
噢，你做的……
呃……
Oh, you made...
Uh...

62
00:03:52,668 --> 00:03:54,659
不不不，事实上……
No no no,
I'm actually...

63
00:03:54,703 --> 00:03:56,694
我正在训练
I'm in training.

64
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:00,004
我正在训练赛跑
I'm in training
for a running thing.

65
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:02,033
-来吧
-不，真的
- Come on.
- No, no really.

66
00:04:02,077 --> 00:04:04,477
并且，我只能吃
符合犹太教规的食物了
And I've gone kosher.

67
00:04:06,181 --> 00:04:08,172
我参加了一个犹太人马拉松
I'm in a Jewish
marathon.

68
00:04:08,217 --> 00:04:09,707
好吧……
Okay...

69
00:04:09,752 --> 00:04:11,947
试一下，好吗？
一口，就一口
Try it, okay?
One bite, one bite.

70
00:04:11,987 --> 00:04:14,387
好极了。就一口
That's it.
One.

71
00:04:16,525 --> 00:04:18,550
和我跑路吧
Run away with me.

72
00:04:18,594 --> 00:04:20,892
真的，你喜欢？
Really, you like it?

73
00:04:20,929 --> 00:04:23,124
哦，我的天，不可思议！
Oh my God,
it's fantastic!

74
00:04:23,165 --> 00:04:25,156
-嗯蓿黛比拉！
-怎么？
- Mmm, Debra!
- Yeah?

75
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,191
棒极了！
It's great!

76
00:04:27,236 --> 00:04:29,227
我不知道雷说的什么意思
I don't know what
Ray's talking about.

77
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,607
什么意思，“说的”？
What do you mean,
"talking about"?

78
00:04:32,641 --> 00:04:34,632
没什么，他只是上班时开开玩笑罢了
Nothing, he was just
trying to be funny at work.

79
00:04:34,676 --> 00:04:37,509
玩笑？
这个？
Funny?
About this?

80
00:04:37,546 --> 00:04:39,241
他拿我的酒烩肉卷开玩笑？
Was he making fun
of my braciole?

81
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,353
不，他没有
No, he was not.

82
00:04:46,388 --> 00:04:50,266
等等，安迪。
他说他喜欢我的肉卷的
Wait, Andy. Andy, he told me
he loved my braciole.
What did he say
to you about it?

83
00:04:50,301 --> 00:04:51,190
他对你怎么说的？

84
00:04:51,226 --> 00:04:53,990
我有没有让你看过我怎么耸耳朵？
看这个……
Did I ever show you how
I can wiggle my ears? Look at this...

85
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:56,327
安迪，安迪。
他到底说的什么？
Andy, Andy.
What did he say about the braciole?

86
00:04:56,365 --> 00:04:58,993
-我没觉出来可笑
-安迪！
- I did not find it funny.
- Andy!

87
00:04:59,034 --> 00:05:01,025
他说那是意大利语
“过路车撞死的动物”
He said it was Italian
for "road kill. "

88
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,061
别伤害我
Please don't hurt me.

89
00:05:04,506 --> 00:05:06,030
“过路车撞死的动物”？
"Road kill"?

90
00:05:06,075 --> 00:05:08,509
他搞搞笑罢了，
就像他一直做的那样
He was just kidding around
like he always does.

91
00:05:08,544 --> 00:05:10,569
他一直这样？
He always does this?

92
00:05:10,612 --> 00:05:13,445
不，不……
No no...

93
00:05:13,482 --> 00:05:16,417
听着，我刚吃了点感冒片
Listen, I had some
TheraFlu earlier.

94
00:05:16,452 --> 00:05:19,819
然后我意识到我甚至没感冒
And then I realized
I do not even have the flu,

95
00:05:19,855 --> 00:05:22,551
我感觉飞起来了，
晕乎晕乎的
so I'm really flying,
whoo-hoo-hoo!

96
00:05:23,892 --> 00:05:25,883
-嘿。嘿
-哦，嘿
- Hey. Hey.
- Oh, hey.

97
00:05:25,928 --> 00:05:27,919
嘿，你的资料，看到了？
Hey, hey, here's your stats,
all right?

98
00:05:27,963 --> 00:05:31,057
以后你自己去取。
我受够了
From now on, you get them
on your own. I'm tired of this.

99
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:45,910
你和安迪上床了？
你可以找个更好的
Are you sleeping with Andy?
'Cause you can do better.

100
00:05:50,686 --> 00:05:52,449
-有意思
-是的
- That's funny.
- Yeah.

101
00:05:52,488 --> 00:05:54,513
哦，什么这么香？
Hey, what
smells good?

102
00:05:54,556 --> 00:05:57,616
哦，我又做酒烩肉卷了。
你知道，因为你这么喜欢
Oh, I made braciole again.
You know, 'cause you liked it so much.

103
00:05:57,659 --> 00:06:00,127
是的，我喜欢！
Yes, I do!

104
00:06:01,396 --> 00:06:04,024
七彩的虹呀！
All the colors
in the rainbow!

105
00:06:05,868 --> 00:06:07,859
哦，真叫个香
Oh, that smells good.

106
00:06:07,903 --> 00:06:10,804
#黛比拉做了好东东#
# Debra made
something good! #

107
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:13,364
#哇哇哇哇#

mwah mwah mwah #

108
00:06:14,576 --> 00:06:17,044

00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:19,479
#SS#
# Yeah-hah #

110
00:06:21,717 --> 00:06:25,619
#你就该做做#
# You ain't got to

111
00:06:25,654 --> 00:06:27,645
#酒烩肉卷#

112
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:30,522
#呼哈呼哈呼#
# Hoo-hah hoo-hah hoo! #

113
00:06:33,462 --> 00:06:36,397

114

#直到失去控制#
# Until I lose contro-ol #

115
00:06:40,335 --> 00:06:44,362
#瓦卡哈瓦卡哇哈哈#
# Wack-ha wacka-wa

116
00:06:44,406 --> 00:06:45,737
#瓦卡哈……#
# Wacka-hah... #

117
00:06:45,774 --> 00:06:48,470
“给你点汁，撞死的动物”
Here's a little sauce
for your road kill.

118
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,501
#咻……#
# Hoo... #

119
00:07:02,457 --> 00:07:04,482
#呜……#
# Woo... #

120
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,755
#怎么了？#
# What? #

121
00:07:13,802 --> 00:07:16,965
你不想听就直接说
“别唱了”
You could have just said,
"Please don't sing. "

122
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:31,198
食物很好。
不过我对服务有几句话说
Food here is good. I might have
a comment about the service.

123
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:36,903
你在上班的时候就这么取笑我的？
你一整天都拿我开心？
Is that what you do at work?
You make fun of me all day?

124
00:07:36,942 --> 00:07:38,842
什么？
不，安迪说的？
What?
No, is that what Andy said?

125
00:07:38,877 --> 00:07:40,674
哦，他干吗这么说？
Oh, why the hell
would he say that?

126
00:07:40,713 --> 00:07:42,943
我不知道，
但他是真的喜欢我的肉卷
I don't know but he actually
loved my braciole.

127
00:07:42,982 --> 00:07:44,973
我爱你的肉卷！
I love your braciole!

128
00:07:45,017 --> 00:07:47,212
别这样，这是你做得最好的了！
Come on, it's the best thing
you ever made!

129
00:07:47,252 --> 00:07:50,016
哦，别废话了！
那你为什么说那是撞死的动物？
Oh baloney! How come you told
everybody it was road kill?

130
00:07:50,055 --> 00:07:52,114
-那是个玩笑
-哦，不，不是的
- That's a joke.
- Oh no, it's not.

131
00:07:52,157 --> 00:07:54,148
当然是的！
我只是开个玩笑罢了
Of course it is!
I was just kidding.

132
00:07:54,193 --> 00:07:56,457
行了，你知道我有多喜欢的
Come on, you see
how much I love it.

133
00:08:01,133 --> 00:08:03,465
我得用用毛巾
I could use
a towel.

134
00:08:05,671 --> 00:08:08,606
哈喽，黛比拉
Hello, Debra.

135
00:08:17,649 --> 00:08:20,516
-怎么回事，弗兰克？
-没事，亲爱的
- What is it, Frank?
- Nothing, dear.

136
00:08:20,552 --> 00:08:23,885
我只是想你这还有没有
美味的酒烩肉卷剩下。
I was just wondering if there was any
of your delicious braciole left.

137
00:08:23,922 --> 00:08:25,480
哦，这是给你的
Oh, these are for you.

138
00:08:27,026 --> 00:08:29,688
哦，爸，别这会，
求你了，好吗？
Oh, Dad, not now,
please, all right?

139
00:08:29,728 --> 00:08:32,094
嘿，你裤子上有点污点
Hey, you got
a little spot there.

140
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:39,292
我告诉你，黛比拉，
你做的东西太棒了
I'm telling you, Debra,
that stuff you made is so great,

141
00:08:39,338 --> 00:08:41,033
我一大早起来就像着它
I woke up
thinking about it.

142
00:08:41,073 --> 00:08:44,304
这个有人吃吗？
Is anybody
eating this?

143
00:08:44,343 --> 00:08:48,006
没有，弗兰克。
你知道，你可以吃这个
No, Frank. You know what?
You can have it.

144
00:08:48,047 --> 00:08:50,038
至少还有人喜欢
At least someone
appreciates it.

145
00:08:50,082 --> 00:08:53,108
-嘿，我喜欢
-谢谢你的话，弗兰克
- Hey, I appreciate it...
- Thank you for the flowers, Frank.

146
00:08:53,152 --> 00:08:56,519
能做这样的肉卷的人
应该得到一整片
Anyone who can make braciole
like this deserves a whole hillside

147
00:08:56,555 --> 00:08:59,251
开满金盏和水仙的山坡
full of heavenly-scented marigolds
and daffodils.

148
00:09:07,032 --> 00:09:08,499
我正好同意他的观点……
I happen to agree
with him...

149
00:09:08,534 --> 00:09:10,119
真动人，弗兰克
That's very sweet,
Frank.

150
00:09:10,569 --> 00:09:13,697
这是很久以来我听到的最动听的话了
That's the nicest thing anybody's
said to me in quite some time.

151
00:09:13,739 --> 00:09:15,366
想来点喝的吗？
Would you like
something to drink?

152
00:09:15,407 --> 00:09:17,398
不，我不想冲淡了原有的风味
No, I don't want
to dilute the flavor.

153
00:09:17,443 --> 00:09:19,638
请坐下
Please sit down.

154
00:09:19,678 --> 00:09:21,646
你该把脚抬起来休息休息
You should be resting
with your feet up.

155
00:09:23,248 --> 00:09:25,216
谢谢，弗兰克
Thank you, Frank.

156
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,219
-好了，得了
-怎么了，雷？
- All right, come on.
- What's the matter, Ray?

157
00:09:28,253 --> 00:09:31,484
我没被嘲笑而是受人称赞
有什么不对劲吗？
Is it so weird that I'm being
appreciated instead of mocked?

158
00:09:31,523 --> 00:09:34,219
-我就是这么带大你的？
-好吧，爸
- Is that how I raised you?
- Yeah, okay, Dad.

159
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,998
嗯蓿太好吃了
Mmm, this is
so delicious.

160
00:09:42,034 --> 00:09:43,524
你真的到家了，孩子
You really
got it, kid.

161
00:09:43,569 --> 00:09:45,662
你真的这么想？
Do you really think so?

162
00:09:45,704 --> 00:09:48,867
有种特别的甜味。
你怎么做的？
There's just like a sweetness to it.
How do you do that?

163
00:09:48,907 --> 00:09:52,308
你知道，有些人用葡萄干，
我用的黑醋栗
Well you know, some people
use raisins, but I had some currants.

164
00:09:52,344 --> 00:09:55,472
-真是美好的东西
-谢谢，弗兰克
- This is a beautiful thing.
- Thank you, Frank.

165
00:10:27,613 --> 00:10:29,945
我以为你在洗澡
I thought you were
taking a bath.

166
00:10:33,352 --> 00:10:35,980
我是洗了。
洗完了
I was.
I finished.

167
00:10:36,989 --> 00:10:39,685
哦
Oh.

168
00:10:39,725 --> 00:10:42,387
洗的好吗？
How was it?

169
00:10:42,427 --> 00:10:46,363
很好，弗兰克。
谢谢你给我准备洗澡水
It was fine, Frank.
Thank you for making it for me.

170
00:10:46,398 --> 00:10:50,732
你有35年没给我准备洗澡水了
You haven't made a bath
for me in 35 years.

171
00:10:53,005 --> 00:10:55,565
呃，你看起来需要
Uh, you seemed
to need it.

172
00:11:03,782 --> 00:11:06,012
听着，玛丽，
并不是你想的那样
Listen, Marie,
this is not what it looks like.

173
00:11:06,051 --> 00:11:07,985
我不是来找你说话的
I'm not talking
to you.

174
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,251
不过， 我有话要问黛比拉
I do have a question
for Debra, however:

175
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:14,726
我做了什么，
你非要毁了我？
What have I done that you
feel the need to destroy me?

176
00:11:16,094 --> 00:11:17,686
什么？
What?

177
00:11:17,729 --> 00:11:19,720
谁跟你说的酒烩肉卷的？
Who told you
about braciole?

178
00:11:19,765 --> 00:11:22,791
没人，我从杂志上找到的
Nobody.
I found a recipe in a magazine.

179
00:11:22,834 --> 00:11:26,793
你找着菜谱了？
哦，你现在成厨师了！
You found a recipe?
Oh, you're a cook now!

180
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,502
-弗兰克从没更你说过酒烩肉卷？
-没有
- Frank never mentioned braciole to you?
- No.

181
00:11:31,543 --> 00:11:33,738
-不
-不，我什么都没说，玛丽……
- No.
- No, I didn't say a thing, Marie...

182
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:36,145
安静
Quiet.

183
00:11:36,181 --> 00:11:38,581
弗兰克从没告诉你
Frank never told you
that braciole

184
00:11:38,617 --> 00:11:41,142
酒烩肉卷是我给做的第一道菜？
was the very first thing
I ever cooked for him?

185
00:11:41,186 --> 00:11:44,019
哦，乖乖
Oh, boy.

186
00:11:44,056 --> 00:11:47,082
-不，我不知道
-你不知道？
- No, I didn't know that.
- You didn't know that?

187
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,093
你知道1959年
Do you know
what he said to me

188
00:11:49,127 --> 00:11:51,891
他吃过我做的酒烩肉卷后
说了什么？
when he tasted
my braciole in 1955?

189
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:56,230
他说：
“做我的新娘吧”
He said,
"Be my bride. "

190
00:11:56,268 --> 00:11:59,294
-玛丽，行了
-“做我的新娘吧”，弗兰克
- Marie, come on.
- "Be my bride," Frank.

191
00:11:59,338 --> 00:12:01,329
“做我的新娘吧”
"Be my bride. "

192
00:12:01,373 --> 00:12:04,206
不过显然只要是
有锅的姑娘都能做你新娘
But it's very clear now
that you'll go to any girl with a pot.

193
00:12:11,984 --> 00:12:13,918
你几乎再没给我做过！
You hardly make it
for me anymore!

194
00:12:13,952 --> 00:12:15,749
因为我不想让你吃腻了
'Cause I didn't want
you to get sick of it.

195
00:12:15,787 --> 00:12:17,721
我都64岁了
I'm 64 years old.

196
00:12:17,756 --> 00:12:20,088
你还留着等什么？
What are you
saving it for?

197
00:12:29,234 --> 00:12:32,431
玛丽，我很抱歉。
我不知道那是你的特别菜
Marie, I'm sorry.
I didn't know it was your special dish.

198
00:12:32,471 --> 00:12:34,564
你就没有别的家务
Don't you have other
household things

199
00:12:34,606 --> 00:12:36,699
需要照顾的，比如……
that you need
to take care of like...

200
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:39,904
比如洗衣服？
like the laundry?

201
00:12:41,413 --> 00:12:43,278
雷蒙德，把裤子给我
Raymond, give me those pants.

202
00:12:43,315 --> 00:12:44,976
-我来洗
-没事的，妈
- I'll wash them.
- It's okay, Mom.

203
00:12:45,017 --> 00:12:47,212
不，我来给你洗裤子，
该死的！
No, I'm washing those
pants for you, damn it!

204
00:12:47,252 --> 00:12:50,744
-妈……
-把裤子脱了！
- Mom...
- Take off your pants!

205
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:09,600
能把暖气开大点吗？
Could we turn
the heat up?

206
00:13:11,777 --> 00:13:13,768
你想让我说什么？
What do you want me
to say, Marie?

207
00:13:13,812 --> 00:13:15,473
“对不起我做酒烩肉卷了”？
"I'm sorry
I made braciole"?

208
00:13:15,514 --> 00:13:17,778
真是疯了！
要是知道会弄得这么天翻地覆
This is insane!
I never would have made the stuff

209
00:13:17,816 --> 00:13:20,717
我才不会做这鬼东西
if I thought it was gonna
turn everybody's world upside-down.

210
00:13:20,852 --> 00:13:24,049
嘿，妈，我没吃的了
Hey, Ma, I have nothing
to eat over there.

211
00:13:25,624 --> 00:13:27,353
你说给我做晚饭的
You said you were
making me dinner.

212
00:13:27,392 --> 00:13:29,053
我不做饭了
I don't cook anymore.

213
00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:33,492
罗伯特，雷蒙德
嘲笑过多少我做的饭？
Robert, how much does Ray
make fun of my cooking?

214
00:13:33,532 --> 00:13:35,625
别看他
Don't look at him.

215
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:37,828
不许看他，罗伯特！
Don't you look
at him, Robert!

216
00:13:39,037 --> 00:13:41,369
-他没穿裤子……
-回答我！
- He's not wearing pants...
- Answer me!

217
00:13:45,077 --> 00:13:46,874
我知道他拿我做的饭开心
I know he makes fun
of my cooking.

218
00:13:46,912 --> 00:13:49,312
我只想知道他在我背后
说了多少次
I want to know how much of it goes on
behind my back.

219
00:13:54,686 --> 00:13:57,450
他一向这样，亲爱的
He makes fun of it
all the time, dear.

220
00:13:59,324 --> 00:14:01,485
这不是真的！
That is not true!

221
00:14:01,526 --> 00:14:04,427
这不是完全真实的，黛比拉！
That's not
completely true, Debra!

222
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:11,863
我爱你的肉卷，
而且我今天不是说谎
I love your braciole
and I am not lying today.

223
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,505
所以你就寻开心，
上班时开玩笑？
Is that why you're making fun of it,
making jokes about it at work?

224
00:14:18,543 --> 00:14:20,534
你拿这道菜开玩笑？
You make jokes
about this food?

225
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:23,844
-你不知道什么叫得体吗？
-哦，得了吧，爸！
- Have you no decency?
- Oh stop. Come on, Dad!

226
00:14:23,882 --> 00:14:25,611
那只是……
你知道，那只是……
It's just...
You know, it's just...

227
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,515
老婆玩笑，就这样
wife jokes,
that's all.

228
00:14:27,552 --> 00:14:31,113
和男人们在一起时做的事
It's something you do when, you know,
when you're with the guys.

229
00:14:31,156 --> 00:14:34,455
-我就从没有
-哦，你说什么呢？
- I never.
- Oh, what are you talking about?

230
00:14:34,493 --> 00:14:36,085
好像你就没讲笑话似的
Like you don't
make jokes.

231
00:14:36,128 --> 00:14:39,359
首先，
我如果有关于你妈的话要说
First of all, if I have anything
to say about your mother,

232
00:14:39,398 --> 00:14:41,696
我不怕当她面说
I'm not afraid to say it
right to her face.

233
00:14:43,268 --> 00:14:45,600
其次，那些也不是笑话
Second of all,
those are not jokes.

234
00:14:55,647 --> 00:14:58,047
昨天你叫我丑八怪
Yesterday you called me
an old bag.

235
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:01,280
如果那是笑话，
也是笑我自己
If that's a joke,
then it's on me.

236
00:15:02,287 --> 00:15:04,517
就当着她的面！
Right in front of her!

237
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:10,026
事实上，不是袒护雷蒙德，
那不过是男人们惯常的事，黛比拉
Actually, not to defend Raymond,
that is a guy thing, Debra.

238
00:15:10,061 --> 00:15:13,724
我常常发现男人们开老婆的玩笑
I've often found that men
use the wife joke to, uh,

239
00:15:13,765 --> 00:15:17,360
以联系感情，分享共同经历
form bonds and share
common experiences.

240
00:15:28,947 --> 00:15:31,415
我是不是坐在酱上了？
Am I sitting
in sauce?

241
00:15:32,451 --> 00:15:34,180
是的，罗伯特
Yes,
Robert.

242
00:15:34,219 --> 00:15:36,881
那就好。
我还担心是我把裤子崩掉了
Good.
I was afraid I popped a stitch.

243
00:15:43,695 --> 00:15:46,664
罗伯特，来，把裤子脱了
Robert, come on.
Take off those pants.

244
00:15:46,698 --> 00:15:49,132
-什么？
-脱掉！
- What?
- Take them off!

245
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:51,260
-你说的什……
-裤子归我！
- Well, what do you...
- I get those pants!

246
00:15:51,303 --> 00:15:54,795
别争了，兄弟，别争
Don't fight it, man,
don't fight it.

247
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,831
快点，我们回家。
我给你收拾收拾
Come on, let's go home,
I'll clean you up.

248
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:59,207
好的
All right.

249
00:16:02,647 --> 00:16:04,114
谢谢，妈
Thanks, Ma.

250
00:16:04,149 --> 00:16:06,481
-你走是不走？
-当然走了
- Are you coming or not?
- Of course I'm coming.

251
00:16:06,518 --> 00:16:08,986
你是我老婆，我属于你
You're my wife.
I belong with you.

252
00:16:11,156 --> 00:16:12,987
我来了
I'm coming.

253
00:16:13,024 --> 00:16:15,458
我给你打电话
I'll call you.

254
00:16:21,066 --> 00:16:24,729
我去洗巴洗巴
I'm gonna go
freshen up.

255
00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:26,737
雷，我能跟你谈谈吗？
Ray, can I talk
to you?

256
00:16:28,306 --> 00:16:30,069
当然，好的。
不过……
Yeah, all right,
but...

257
00:16:30,108 --> 00:16:32,406
我有点点冻
I'm a little
chilly.

258
00:16:33,678 --> 00:16:35,145
你为什么非得开老婆玩笑？
Why do you have to
make wife jokes?

259
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,148
我不那么做，
我不开老公玩笑
I don't do that.
I don't make husband jokes.

260
00:16:37,182 --> 00:16:40,845
你不会告诉我
你没跟艾米、琳达出去
Are you telling me that you don't go
out with Amy and Linda

261
00:16:40,886 --> 00:16:43,821
取笑我做的那些傻事，你知道的？
and make fun of all
the stupid things I do, you know?

262
00:16:43,855 --> 00:16:47,552
你没说我念书时嘴巴怎么动
You don't talk about
the way my lips move when I read

263
00:16:47,592 --> 00:16:50,823
或者有一次你逮到我要脚趾甲
or you caught me biting
my toenail that one time

264
00:16:50,862 --> 00:16:53,387
或者，或者……
or or or that...

265
00:16:55,033 --> 00:16:58,366
不，我没有。
事实上，我努力朝另一边说
No, I don't. In fact, I try to spin it
in the other direction.

266
00:16:58,403 --> 00:16:59,961
琳达以为你有马斯特的？
Linda thinks you
have a master's.

267
00:17:00,005 --> 00:17:01,939
马斯特的？
Master's?

268
00:17:01,973 --> 00:17:05,500
学位。
硕士学位，雷
Degree.
Master's degree, Ray.

269
00:17:05,544 --> 00:17:07,444
这就是我弄不明白的了
This is what I don't
understand.

270
00:17:07,479 --> 00:17:09,538
你总是嘲笑我做的饭
You're always making fun
of my cooking,

271
00:17:09,581 --> 00:17:11,446
而我终于做了你喜欢的东西
but I finally
make something you like

272
00:17:11,483 --> 00:17:14,111
而你还是拿来开玩笑。
为什么？
and you're still making
jokes about it. Why?

273
00:17:14,152 --> 00:17:16,484
我是个复杂的人
I'm a complicated
person.

274
00:17:17,822 --> 00:17:20,416
别这样，那只是……
我就是那样子
Oh, come on, it's just...
that's who I am.

275
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,449
我拿妻子开开玩笑
I make fun of
the wife a little.

276
00:17:22,494 --> 00:17:25,861
“哦，雷来了……
雷，她昨晚对你干了什么？”
"Oh here's Ray...
Ray, what did she do to you last night?"

277
00:17:25,897 --> 00:17:29,958
如果我说：
“她做了酒烩肉卷，味道好极了”
And if I say, "She made some braciole
and it was quite tasty,"

278
00:17:30,001 --> 00:17:32,196
哇……
谁想跟这种人一块玩？
wha... who wants
to hang out with that guy?

279
00:17:33,605 --> 00:17:35,903
不过你不认为有什么不对劲吗？
But don't you think that
there's something wrong

280
00:17:35,941 --> 00:17:38,432
除了那我开玩笑没别的办法
让别人喜欢？
that the only way you
can be popular is at my expense?

281
00:17:38,476 --> 00:17:41,104
我希望能有别的办法
I wish there was
another way.

282
00:17:41,146 --> 00:17:43,137
好吧……
All right...

283
00:17:43,181 --> 00:17:45,172
噢，别这样
Aw, come on.

284
00:17:45,216 --> 00:17:46,911
我开玩笑的
I'm kidding.

285
00:17:46,952 --> 00:17:48,943
看， 咱们都知道咱俩几斤几两
Hey look, we know
the score here.

286
00:17:48,987 --> 00:17:50,978
你哪样都比我强，不是吗？
You got it
all over me, right?

287
00:17:51,022 --> 00:17:55,049
你是那个漂亮聪明集于一身的
好的那个
You're the pretty, smart,
together, good one.

288
00:17:55,093 --> 00:17:58,119
而对我，他们说：
“他怎么娶到她的？”
I'm the one they say,
"How did he get her?"

289
00:17:58,163 --> 00:18:00,859
所以，我不知道，
也许以我的傻方式
So I don't know,
maybe in my stupid way,

290
00:18:00,899 --> 00:18:02,594
我告诉他们怎么回事
I'm telling them how.

291
00:18:02,634 --> 00:18:05,296
你知道，
“她不会做饭。哈哈”
You know,
"She can't cook. Ha ha. "

292
00:18:07,138 --> 00:18:09,231
啊哈哈
Ah ha ha ha ha.

293
00:18:10,241 --> 00:18:11,970
怎么了？
What?

294
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:15,537
这还不是最糟的。
你认识查克・威尔森吧？
你知道他怎么对我说的？
It could be worse. You know Chuck
Wilson? You know what he told me?

295
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,981
他说她是那么冷感，
他和她一块上床的时候
He said his wife is so cold,
when he gets into bed with her,

296
00:18:19,017 --> 00:18:21,679
必须要使劲把企鹅赶跑
he has to shoo away
the penguins.

297
00:18:27,792 --> 00:18:30,488
赶跑企鹅
Shoo away
the penguins.

298
00:18:30,528 --> 00:18:33,759
冷感。
威尔森的老婆
That's cold.
Wilson's wife.

299
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:37,160
然而……
And yet...

300
00:18:37,202 --> 00:18:39,193
我对她的印象一点也没变坏
I don't think
any less of her.

301
00:18:40,538 --> 00:18:43,735
我不在乎别的男人怎么想我
I don't care what the other guys
think about me.

302
00:18:43,775 --> 00:18:46,005
我在乎的是你怎么想的
I care what you
think about me.

303
00:18:53,084 --> 00:18:55,052
我再也不开玩笑了
I'm not gonna make
jokes anymore.

304
00:18:56,421 --> 00:18:58,150
谢谢
Thank you.

305
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:01,190
你还会给我做饭吗？
Are you still
gonna cook for me?

306
00:19:01,226 --> 00:19:03,558
是的
Yes.

307
00:19:04,562 --> 00:19:07,258
想把裤子脱了吗？
Wanna take
your pants off?

308
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,265
不
No.

309
00:19:14,305 --> 00:19:16,739
好吧，那我能再来点酱吗？
Okay, then can I
have more sauce?

310
00:19:19,411 --> 00:19:22,005
哦，行了
Aw, come on.

311
00:19:23,415 --> 00:19:25,178
行了……
Come on...

312
00:19:32,824 --> 00:19:35,418
嘿，你在干什么？
Hey. What are
you doing?

313
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,860
我在喝茶
I'm having some tea.

314
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:46,530
-没做晚饭？
-做了，茶
- Didn't make any dinner?
- Yes, tea.

315
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,807
哦
Oh.

316
00:19:50,842 --> 00:19:53,504
黛比拉今晚做什么了？
And what did Debra
make tonight?

317
00:19:54,879 --> 00:19:57,575
宽面条
Lasagna.

318
00:19:57,615 --> 00:20:00,083
完了
It's over.

319
00:20:02,253 --> 00:20:03,845
怎么了？
What?

320
00:20:03,888 --> 00:20:07,949
我想她就会做酒烩肉卷
I think that braciole
is all she can make.

321
00:20:10,228 --> 00:20:13,288
听着，玛丽，
我明白了件事
Listen, Marie,
I learned something.

322
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:16,790
男人需要的不只是酒烩肉卷
A man needs more
than braciole.

323
00:20:18,803 --> 00:20:20,794
男人需要……
A man needs...

324
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:24,138
鸡肉
chicken,

325
00:20:24,175 --> 00:20:27,338
小牛肉，干酪酿茄子
veal, eggplant parmesan.

326
00:20:27,378 --> 00:20:30,040
裹肉通心粉？
Manicotti?

327
00:20:30,081 --> 00:20:32,777
是的，果肉通心粉
Yes, manicotti.

328
00:20:32,817 --> 00:20:35,217
哦，弗兰克！
Oh, Frank!

329
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,282
-弗兰克
-什么？
- And Frank?
- Yes?

330
00:20:42,327 --> 00:20:44,921
再也不许提这件事了
We'll never speak
of this again.
