You can unleash your powers if you
have a match of Go with the expert.

When you get the
'unleash stamp' from the expert

the withheld powers
will show in the book.

Then we need to battle
until tomorrow morning.

If we don't win, we can't leave.

293
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,960
It needs to be
something like stone fight.

294

Jackstones using Go stones.

295
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,740
This is possible.

the people can recognize it, right?

301
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,730
We just have to win one more than him.

302
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:20,730
I'm really detailed when I draw,
so I usually take a long time...

303
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,040
Just draw one, and
make sure people can tell.

304
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,040
Speed is important.
Do you draw fast?

305
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:31,180
Just because I'm an artist,
it doesn't mean my drawings are great.

306

Then, we will start
with the first topic.

311

The subject is animals, starting now!

312
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,470
Animals are hard to draw!

313
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:59,910
I'll draw the animals on the right,
you draw from the left.

314
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,380
The left side is super hard!

[He even finishes drawing
the sea lion speedily.]

319
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,960
Is a skunk's head white or black?

320
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,560
- Is the middle black?
- A skunk?

321
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,030
- I don't know...
- Where's the white part?

322
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:30,370
Just draw him farting!

323
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:33,510
That's a squirrel!

324
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,880
- I don't know where the white part is...
- Just draw him farting.

finishes drawing a mole.]

- Which part is red on a crane?
- I don't know!

Don't color, it's black anyway!

328

Where's the red part?
Is it the middle?

329
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:52,220
- There red somewhere... the eyes?
- Just draw the key parts.

330
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,390
Jin Ho, what do you have left?

331
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,310
I'm drawing an anteater, right now.

332
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:01,420
You're drawing all the ants one by one?

333

[Kwang Soo's monster vs.
Cho Suk's meerkat.]

337

you can unleash your powers.'

346
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:49,580
'You must each sing a verse from
children's songs by taking turns.'

347
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:53,420
'It is important to sing your song and not
get confused by your opponent's song.'

348
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,980
[One verse karaoke]

349
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,250
We sing a different
song by taking turns?

350
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,560
But we have to sing our own.

351
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,760
I think we'll get confused...

352
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,590
Then I'll go first.

353
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,700
Here, miss expert.

354
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,670
Oh, you must like the color blue.

355
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,670
Pick one.

356
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:16,240
Pick your favorite color.

357
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,740
The expert's song is...

358
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,440
'Little Calf.'

359
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,850
- Oh, 'Little Calf.'
- You know the song, right?

360
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:27,050
[The children's song that everyone
knows is the song for the expert?]

361
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,720
Should we open ours, then?

362
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,950
[Then what song did
Kkuk and Soo Ji draw?]

363
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:36,190
'Icicle.'

364
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:39,790
<i>Icicle, icicle.</i>

365
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:43,300
- You don't know it?
- No, I have no clue!

366
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,700
- Why don't you know it?
- What song is that?

367
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,190
Did you spend your
childhood exercising?

368
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,760
- Yes, I did.
- Really?

369
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,570
[Kkuk will be starting
first as their rep.]

370
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:58,850
<i>Little calf, little calf.
Spotted little calf.</i>

371
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,220
<i>Ici... cle.</i>

372
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,880
[Super low-pitched]

373
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,790
[Head shot]

374
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:10,020
This is hard... this is really hard!

375
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,060
- Did it hurt?
- It was too hard!

376
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,760
It was too hard!

377
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,260
Can I do this instead?
This hurts so much!

378
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,600
She can raise her leg
instead of her hand.

379
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,570
Me, me!

380
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:27,710
[It's hard to sing different
songs and taking turns.]

381
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:31,610
<i>Icicle, icicle.
Wait, that's not it.</i>

382
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:36,110
[That's butterfly.
Are you going to make the icicle fly?]

383
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,250
[Second try]

384
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,590
<i>Little calf, little calf.</i>

385
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:45,690
<i>I... cicle!</i>

386
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,430
[A gymnast's defense]
It's right!

387
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:53,130
[It's not i.. cicle, it's icicle.]

388
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:56,400
We sang it like this
in our neighborhood!

389
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,970
[Which neighborhood adds a
groove in a children's song?]

390
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,370
It's a variation!

391
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:06,940
[No improvisation allowed
for a strict evaluation!]

392
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:13,220
Well, here is the mission
you have to complete.

393
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,290
The sound master.

394
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,030
If you find a student that can replicate
the voice that the expert shows you

395
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,830
you can unleash your powers.

396
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:29,500
[You want us to find a
voice doppelganger?]

397
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,440
If that student's voice
is over 90% accurate

398
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,510
then you will get a stamp, and
your powers will be unleashed.

399
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:42,650
[What is this...]
Can you do it?

400
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:46,850
You must not be on good terms
with the producers...

401
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,620
[Otherwise, this kind of
labor is unnecessary...]

402
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:52,260
I will let you hear the
first voice for the mission.

403
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,420
You have to listen to it carefully.

404
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,660
You unmannerly bastard!

405
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,860
It's Yoon Mun Sik!

406
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,460
'You unmannerly bastard!'

407
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,500
But they have to be really old...

408
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,570
As long as their
speech pattern is the same.

409
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:10,840
You know T.O.P is really good
at imitating this, too!

410
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,110
[Accuracy is 98%, Yoon Mun Top!]

411
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,880
Ha Ha, on the move!

412
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,010
- We have to do it together!
- I need to save energy.

413
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:20,010
Hurry!

414
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,010
I'll be here.

415
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:24,920
Who is able to imitate Yoon Mun Sik?

416
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:29,190
- Show them once.
- Who can do 'you unmannerly bastard'?

417
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:32,060
[Many challengers are coming to them.]

418
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,260
You unmannerly... sorry!

419
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,030
- You unmannerly bastard!
- Wow!

420
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:41,200
- Louder, louder.
- Raise it by one octave.

421
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,440
- It's too low.
- You unmannerly bastard!

422
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,570
- He has a possibility!
- He's good.

423

[A challenger with a
bowl haircut is here.]

424
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,880
Oh, you look like you can do it well!
Start!

425
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,910
- You unmannerly bastard!
- Make it longer.

426

You unmannerly bastard!
This bastard...

427
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:01,690
[It was my style of acting.]

428
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:05,590
Try it one at a time.
We need to vote.

429
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,930
- Ready, set!
- You unmannerly bastard!

430

- You unmannerly bastard!
- You unmannerly bastard!

431
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,670
- You unmannerly bastard!
- They're going to fight!

432
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:16,170
Thank you!
See you again soon!

433
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:19,640
- You need to make it clear.
- And higher.

434
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,380
Like this, you unmannerly bastard!

435
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,010
It's Yoon Mun Sik!

436

[They enter proudly with the
assumption that they're going to win.]

[Jang Man Gil, 25 years old.]

438
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:32,890
- There wasn't much time.
- It's 100 percent!

439
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:35,250
- It was a little easy...
- It's exactly the same!

440
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:38,620
- This person sounds exactly the same.
- Are you sure?

441
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:42,390
You... you... unmannerly bastard!

442
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:47,280
[What kind of results will they get?]

443
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,840
Wow, it sounds the same!

444
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,670
[Anticipation]

445
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:54,450
We won, we won.

446
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:57,610
[They listen to the original again
to make sure it's accurate.]

447
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:02,710
- You unmannerly bastard!
- It was this long?

448
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:06,550
It's so long!
Did it stretch out all of a sudden?

449
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,520
Wow, this is too long.

450
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12,890
[Long vs. short]

451
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:16,990
First of all, the length of
the sound is different.

452
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:20,970
The most important thing
is the speech pattern

453
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:23,530
but the speed of the sound here...

454
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,440
- the problem is...
- Will is be over 90%?

455
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,940
No, probably around 75%.

456
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,110
[Finding the voice doppelganger,
first attempt fail.]

457
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:33,840
[Finding Kim Hee Ae's voice.]

458
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,210
Who can imitate it?

459
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:39,880
This is a top compliment.
[Not similar]

460
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,690
[Similar to the person before]

461
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,890
This is a top compliment!

462
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,320
[Extremely not similar]

463
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:51,060
[Finding Kim Jong Kook's voice.]

464
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,900
You only play the guitar, right?

465
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,900
[Promise me that you'll
only play the guitar...]

466
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,530
Just challenge!
Anybody!

467
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,670

00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,350
Sorry, I got a little angry.

471
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,350
[Will he be able to]

472
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,350
[complete the mission?]

473
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:18,720
What is this?
The cooking master.

474
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,460
We wouldn't be making a dish, would we?

475
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,590
Tasting challenge with the chef...
how is this possible?

476
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:27,400
How do we compete against the expert?

477
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,910
With your eyes and nose covered,
eat different ingredients.

478
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:37,680
You have to guess the ingredients
the staff call out, in order.

479
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,960
Please go easy on us!

480
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,710
[Gives up as soon as
he hears the mission.]

481
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:48,730
The first mission is types of powder.

482
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:52,110
[With the eyes and nose covered,
eat three similar ingredients.]

483
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:55,880
[Guess the ingredient
before the expert to win.]

484
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,930
[First, is coffee.]

485
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:00,760
Here's the second.
[Next is brown sugar.]

486
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,440
[When the nose is covered]

487
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,130
[the taste buds become dull
because the smell is part of the taste.]

488
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:10,400
[The last one is salt.]

489
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,610
[He takes a big mouthful of salt.]

490
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:13,640
[Yuck]

491
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,810
[It must be salty!]

492
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:18,980
It's yummy, is there any tequila?

493
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,350
[He must have realized what it was.]

494
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,350
Why isn't there any left?

495
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,720
I'm scared.

496
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:32,030
[I'm ready]
Answer!

497
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:36,960
Coffee, then sugar, then salt.

498
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,970
Correct!

499
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:43,840
[How do we beat the chef?]

500
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,340
[Gary and Suk Jin's mission.]

501
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,810
Play 'catch the thief' with the
expert, and if you win once

502
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:53,480
you can unleash your powers.

503
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,780
The cards have to be divided
evenly among three players.

504
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:02,650
Then, throw away any cards that
have the same numbers.

505
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,990
Going in order, take a
card from your opponent

506
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:11,430
and collect all the same numbers
and if you become empty-handed

507
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:15,000
you can win. The last one who
has the thief card loses.

508
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,800
It's a psychological game.

509
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,500
- He's an expert...
- We're playing this with Pyo Chang Won.

510
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,810
I would like to help you,
but I can't lose on purpose.

511
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:25,010
Sorry, please understand
even if we win.

512
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,980
Yes, go ahead.

513
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:32,920
[Will Big Nose and Gary be able
to beat the crime solver expert?]

514
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,290
We will now start 'catch the thief.'

515
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,490
Please divide the cards.

516
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,990
- Yes.
- Wait a minute.

517
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:44,500
It's a little suspicious,
so I will shuffle it.

518
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,900
Well we never know if

519
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,900
you did something with
the cards before we got here.

520
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,070
That's a very good attitude.

521
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:57,210
He doesn't get drawn
into what you said.

522
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:00,540
Being suspicious is a good
start to solving mysteries.

523
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:04,980
[Big Nose divides the stack and
hands out 10 cards to each player.]

524
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,020
[Let's see...]

525
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,950
It would be beneficial to have
many of the same numbers.

526
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,860
You really divided them well.

527
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:16,690
[Gary's cards are 1, 2, 3, and 4]

528
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,830
[and the thief card.]

529
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,330
[Why are you hiding there?]

530
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:25,200
The person who has the thief card

531
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,310
will probably put it in the middle so that
the next person can pull it out easily.

532
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,370
[Shiver]

533
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,140
Pick one, please.

534
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,850
You have one more card than us.

535
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,210
- Right?
- Yes.

536
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:41,250
- So you have a higher chance...
- Yes, very high.

537
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,650
Very high.

538
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:46,020
I don't have it.

539
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,420
Don't try to be psychological!

540
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:51,890
I'm being drawn in, right now!

541
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,560
I'm doing it so we don't get drawn in.

542
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,860
I don't want to get drawn in.

543
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,800
Do everything you can.

544
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,640
You said the thief card is
placed usually in the middle.

545
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,940
I will daringly take
the one in the middle.

546
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:10,980
- Thank you, you gave me a seven.
- Lucky seven.

547
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,150
[He picked a seven and cleared a pair.]

548
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,930
Then I will pick...

549
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:19,710
[Lame psychological battle]

550
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:22,280
I will go with the far left.

551
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:26,990
Do you want this one?
Take it.

552
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:30,760
Hmm...

553
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,850
[His face is pretty relaxed.]

554
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,790
You and I are in the same boat.

555
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:41,510
Then I will clear this pair.

556
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:43,130
[Gary made a pair of nines.]

557
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:45,510
Here, pick one.

558
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,730
Gary, your eyes keep
shifting to the left.

559
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:53,910
When I'm with my girlfriend

560
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:57,680
I always look to the left.

561
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:03,080
- Is that the truth?
- No, not that one!

562
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,420
[An intense psychological warfare]

563
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,960
Can you even tell by feeling it?

564
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,560
Hmm... is that?

565
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,560
[Look at his reaction...]

566
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,820
[30 years of experience
in solving crimes.]

567
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:21,680
[The realistic analysis
based on statics.]

568
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:27,990
[What's the safest card
that all the data tells?]

569
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:34,650
[The thief came.]

570
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,850
[Oh no...]

571
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:40,310
[What just happened?]

572
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:42,880
[Embarrassed]
I picked it precisely.

573
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,880
[It's too precise...]

574
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,080
Do I keep looking on my left?

575
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,190
I can't normally lie...
I can't lie at all in front of you.

576
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:54,160
You seemed happy.

577
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,960
I wonder if he picked the thief.

578
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,680
You have seven cards.

579
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,280
I don't think you'll keep the thief
in the middle.

580
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,850
Well...

581
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,650
[He's lured!]

582
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,910
[Nod]

583
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:14,910
Wait, why did you nod?
It means you want me to pick it.

584
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:18,310
[We thought you're an expert,
but you're docile.]

585
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:21,130
Then, I'll pick the one beside.

586
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:24,220
Oh, I see.
[Total failure]

587
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,850
- He just nodded.
- It's getting better.

588
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:30,560
[He has dealt with criminals, but he
might not have dealt with cards.]

589
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,190
Who has the thief?

590
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,450
I wanted to pick the card
in the middle for a while.

591
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:39,330
I think you've noticed that
I like to pick the one in the middle.

592
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:42,020
So, I think if you have a bad card...

593
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:45,910
- you would have put it in the middle.
- Is that so?

594
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:49,220
Yes.
[Preserving the equilibrium]

595
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,330
And the result is...

596
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:55,530
He isn't very happy.
Then I'll pick this one.

597
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,620
[Suk Jin looked at his face
and pick the card.]

598
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,160
[Dizzy]

599
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,510
Number one!

600
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,910
[He picked number one
and made a pair.]

601
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:09,790
- Then it means...
- You'll pick this one, and I'm done.

602
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:13,590
[Big-nose finishes his stack.]

603
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,480
[Huh?]
[Suk Jin's last card was 10?]

604
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,860
[Gary finishes the game, too.]
It's destiny!

605
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:25,190
Naturally, this card
will be given to you...

606
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:30,020
[That's how the crime solver
ended up with the thief.]

607
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:32,530
We won on our first try!

608
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,420
[Bitter]

609
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,820
I had the thief at first...

610
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,930
he picked it when he
made his first comment.

611
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:43,730
[Detective instinct?]
[He never let the thief go.]

612
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,190
He's perfect for variety shows!

613
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:47,360
[Gary and Suk Jin's
ability is unleashed!]

614
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,790
Have you played Jackstones before?

615
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,620
- Not with Go stones...
- It's the same.

616
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:55,880
I never thought Master Cho
would play Jackstones with Go stones.

617
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,110
It's the first time.

618
00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:01,670
The world renown go master
is going to play Jackstones...

619
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:04,710
I'm in trouble.
How can I win this?

620
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,370
[The one who gets
5 points first will win.]

621
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:09,220
[Master Cho Hoon Hyun
kicks off the game.]

622
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,450
If I were younger,
I think could play this.

623
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,560
[His moves are pretty fast.]

624
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:18,930
[It seems that he's played
Jackstones a lot.]

625
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:22,160
It's the second stage.

626
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,290
Oh no!

627
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:30,420
[The high pitch voice of his!]

628
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:33,360
You were really cute.

629
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,280
You must be disappointed.

630
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,620
[The master of Go reveals
his cute scream for Jackstones.]

631
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:42,560
Ready.
If she can finish...

632
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:47,380
[Her big hands might be helpful.]

633
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,810
[It's up to you, Yeon Koung.]

634
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,250
[Absent-minded...]

635
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,550
Nice!
Good!

636
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:57,490
That's right!

637
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:01,050
- Great!
- This is the critical moment.

638
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:04,160
[They're going straight into
grabbing two stones at a time.]

639
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,360
- It's nice!
- Very good!

640
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,700
[His fanning is accelerating.]

641
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,020
- The way you grab the stones...
- Oh ho!

642
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,560
That's it, that's it!

643
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,450
[The position of the stones is great.]

644
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:17,480
It's perfect!

645
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:22,450
Great!
[An advanced skill, 'the railroad'!]

646
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,310
[Continue the winning streak]

647
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:28,990
[and sweep all four stones!]

648
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:31,730
[Now there's only one more left!]

649
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:33,680
I need to grab all five.

650
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,030
[Wow]

651
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:40,310
[All five stones at once!]

652
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:44,160
[They will succeed the
mission if she grabs all five!]

653
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:49,570
[Fail!]
That was so close!

654
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:53,510
[Now, the expert needs
to grab four stones.]

655
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,220
[High pitch scream]

656
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,350
[The expert's scream
is quite addicting.]

657
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:02,320
You are very disappointed.

658
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,960
Because I almost made it.

659
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,540
On your fan,
it's written 'absent-minded.'

660
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:10,730
But, I'm actually greedy inside.

661
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:13,960
The fan says 'absentmindedness'
but you're greedy inside?

662
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:15,680
Wow, you are very..

663
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,250
[Being competitive]
We need to win this.

664
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,170
[It's Yoo Hyuk's turn to snap.]

665
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:25,620
Three points!
Great!

666
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,540
We gained three points first.

667
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,310
[They need to get two more points.]
Look at the position!

668
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:32,310
[Who's that person at the back?]

669
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,190
[While Yoo Hyuk passed the first stage]

670
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:39,760
[Master Cho's wife
is watching their game.]

671
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,990
[The stones are little too close.]

672
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:46,530
[Yoo Hyuk fails at the stages.]

673
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:50,700
Oh, she's watching?
Maybe she can try.

674
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,710
- I have small hands.
- I'm not good at it, either.

675
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,740
[The ringer joins the game.]

676
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:04,080
[The wife of Master Cho
will start from snap.]

677
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:09,680
- Wow!
- Keep playing.

678
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,080
Start from the first stage again.

679
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,280
- Oh, from the first stage?
- Yes.

680
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,560
It's been a while since
I've played Jackstones.

681
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,990
- She's good...
- Aren't you an expert, ma'am?

682
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:21,930
[She reassures them
with her modest words.]

683
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,680
[She's plowing through]

684
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:29,850
[If this continues...]

685
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:31,450
[Ho ho ho]

686
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:33,590
This is bad...

687
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:39,110
[She failed at grabbing two stones.]
She's so good!

688
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,480
She's really good.

689

[Jae Suk and Yeon Kyung just need
to get two more points![

more stones, he wins.]

[The speed of his fan
is at maximum speed.]

693
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:56,790
I'm sorry ma'am,
I need to finish it here.

694
00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:00,990
[Three stones survived.]

695
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,770
[Will they be able to
finish it this round?]

696
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,450
[Young fellow...]

697
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:12,910
[They succeeded in
getting five points!]

698
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:15,480
- Thank you very much.
- Well done.

00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,110
[They can now unleash
the hero's powers!]

700
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:22,310
I get it now.
I understand the game.

Who will go first?

705
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:37,280
- Would like to go first?
- I'll go first.

706
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,390
Does it have to be a person?

707
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:43,080
[Well, I guess a dog
can't really guess...]

708
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:46,080
- What about the woman over there?
- Oh, us?

709
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,790
Oh, thank you very much.

710
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:50,530
- Hello.
- Hello.

711
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:53,510
- Do you have five minutes?
- Can you solve this quiz?

712
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,730
- Do you like sports?
- Yes.

713
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:58,450

What's the name of this?

You ride it... a bobsleigh!

725
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:33,510
- You have 15 seconds.
- Hurry, hurry!

726
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:36,050
There aren't many things
to do on the ice...

Oh, figure skating!

728
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:41,590
Is this right?
[Worry, worry]

729
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,680
What about this?

730
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,000
[Time up]

731
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,650
[They got eight questions right.]

732

There are different
types of sports drawn.

733

sport in the empty space.

melody she sings.]

[It's more confusing because
it's a similar melody.]

- Oh!
- It's the same, right?

769
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:03,630
[The graphs looks very similar.]

770
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:08,480
The similarity is about 91%

00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,680
[They succeeded the voice
doppelganger mission!]

772
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:15,910
[They retry the tasting
challenge, with three]

[three different jam flavors.]

774
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:20,950
Strawberry jam, apple jam, grape jam!

775
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:22,510
[That's correct!]

776
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,910
[They succeeded the tasting challenge!]

777
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,530

[they need to get
a stamp from the expert.]

[Premium benefit after
battling with the experts!]

781
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:49,960
[The heroes' powers are unleashed!]

782
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:54,720
[How will these powers be used?]

783
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,480
[Finally, the final match.]

784
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,960

[Jae Suk enters with
the book of secrets.]

788
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:19,820
Huh?

789
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:24,160
[He walks through the
passage with green lights.]

790
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,580
You need to open the book
that you received

791
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,980
shout 'summon the hero, '
then place the book down.

792
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:35,130
Summon my hero!

793
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:37,850
[Name cloning power.]

794
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:43,960
[He summons
the Goddess of spikes, Yeon Kyung.]

795
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:47,420
[Ji Hyo enters next.]

796
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:52,810
Summon my hero!

797
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:55,330
[Temporary sending-off power.]

798
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:01,820
[She summoned the soccer
Crown Prince, Jong Gook.]

799
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:04,020
Don't leave my side!

800
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:07,680
- Summon my soul!
- It's hero, not soul.

801
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,060
[He was going to summon a ghost.]

802
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,480
Summon my hero!

803
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,710
[He summoned the historic dunker,
Joo Yup.]

804
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:24,000
Summon my hero!

805
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:28,730
[He summoned the game genius, Jin Ho.]

806
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:31,330
I was gaming, why did you call me?

807
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:33,650
I was winning...

808
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,680
[He summoned the ribbon fairy, Soo Ji.]

809
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,590
Yes, you have summoned me.

810
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:43,360
[He summoned the
'Running Man' hero, Suk Jin.]

811
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:49,330
- We meet again!
- I'll give it all I've got for victory!

812
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:51,450
I'm going to win today.

813
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:55,880
- But do you know about this?
- No.

814
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,910
I don't know even after I've read it.

815
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:03,070
This race is to pick the strongest.
It's the fourth battle.

816
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:07,620
From now on, you will be using
your hero's unleashed powers.

817
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:11,390
You need to eliminate the
'Running Man' members' name tags.

818
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:13,510
- Only 'Running Man' members?
- Yes.

819
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:17,790
Even if the hero's name tag is
eliminated, they can't be ousted.

820
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:21,090
And they can't eliminate
any name tags, either.

821
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:23,330
This is important,
the other teams' name tag

822
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:25,590
can only be ousted by
'Running Man' members.

823
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:29,730
That means Song Jong Gook
can't eliminate name tags.

824
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:33,450
- But I can hold them down?
- Yes, you can.

825
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:36,390
So the one physically eliminating
it should be Ha Ha.

826
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:39,820
So because we are one, if my name tag
is eliminated then my hero also...

827
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,360
- Correct?
- I'll be ousted?

828
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:44,160
Yes, if Ha Ha is ousted,
you are also ousted.

829
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,360
When Jae Suk's name tag is eliminated,
Yeon Koung will also be ousted.

830
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,720
Do well.

831
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,530
- Okay.
- We're in the same boat.

832
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:58,990
The important thing is the
power you've unleashed.

833
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:00,990
I will tell you how you can use them.

834
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:04,450
There will a bamboo case
that has an orange 'R' sticker.

835
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:09,220
If you open it, there
will be a golden glove.

836
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:11,130
You need to wear that

837
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:15,110
and scream 'Name cloning!'

838
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:19,110
For example, if it's Kim Jong Kook,
slap his back with a spike.

839
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:23,510
From that moment on, Jong Kook's
name tag will be on Jae Suk's back.

840
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:25,510
This is hard!

841
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:28,650
She has to hit Jong Kook's back,
but how is she going to do that?

842
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:30,250
You have to yell 'name cloning!'

843
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:33,730
So Jong Kook's name tag
will be on Jae Suk's back.

844
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:37,910
You have to ask someone else
to eliminate it within a minute.

845
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:41,930
After the minute passes,
your name tag will return on your back.

846
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:44,530
For one minute...

847
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:48,560
However, if your team and
Jong Kook's team are left

848
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:53,360
then, you can eliminate it yourself.

849
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,250
Only if you're the last two.

850
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:57,720
[The power of name cloning.]

851
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,390
[Kim Yeon Koung can clone
other Running Man's name tag.]

852
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:03,290
[If the name tag is eliminated,
that member will be ousted.]

853
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:08,760
Find a red bamboo case
which will have a red card inside.

854
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,900
When you have found the
person you want to oust

855
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:16,080
blow the whistle,
yell 'temporary sending-off!'

856
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:19,710
you need to place the red card
on the 'Running Man' member's sock.

857
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,390
The hero will be kicked out of
the building for 15 minutes.

858
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:25,710
Don't place the sticker
on a hero's foot.

859
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:28,380
[Temporary sending-off power.]

860
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,950
[Sending off a hero by putting
a red card on Running Man's foot.]

861
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:33,360
Find the green case, and inside...

862
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:37,360
- what do you need to reboot?
- Ctrl alt delete?

863
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,590
'Ctrl, ' 'Alt, ' and 'Delete.'

864
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:43,680
The keys will be in three
different cases.

865
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,020
You have to find all three

866
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:52,080
and find the only computer that
you can use the keyboard with.

867
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,340
Find it, connect the keyboard

868
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:57,610
and yell 'keyboard attack,
oust Kim Jong Kook!' press enter

869
00:46:57,610 --> 00:47:00,310
then Kim Jong Kook will be ousted.

870
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:02,930
- Can you type five people in a row?
- No.

871
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:05,250
- Just once?
- Yes, you can only oust once.

872
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:06,720
Only one at a time.

873
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,510
You can try and find
more keys after that.

874
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:11,020
[The keyboard attack.]

875
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:12,880
[Complete the keyboard and oust!]

876
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,910
I will explain about the
ribbon teleportation.

877
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:21,760
Find the bamboo case
with a purple 'R' sticker

878
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,480
and there will be a ribbon inside.

879
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:28,790
In a dangerous situation,
yell 'ribbon teleportation!'

880
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:30,760
swirl your ribbon in the air

881
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:36,310
there will be a shield, so you can
teleport without anyone knowing.

882
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:39,680
- It means that they have to act, right?
- That's right.

883
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,930
They will have to stay still
and we'll move you.

884
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:48,620
[Ribbon teleportation.]
[Teleportation by swirling the ribbon.]

885
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:51,130
The memory extinction power.

886
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:57,070
I think you played with this
when you were younger.

887
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:59,970
You know the fart bombs
that have a nasty smell.

888
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:03,670
Everyone who smells it
will lose their memory.

889
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:07,780
- I have to blast it?
- At a critical moment.

890
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:10,650
If the hero uses his powers
after Gary is ousted

891
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:17,220
the people around him will lose
their memory and go back to the past.

892
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:23,220
How many are there?
Give me two thousand bombs!

893
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:26,690
Whoever ousts you won't be able
to remember that they did it.

894
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:29,530
Gary might win this battle again!

895
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:31,670
He's Mr. Random Capable.
[He won the first and second.]

896
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:34,170
Should I be randomly capable today?

897
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:38,110
[He's full of energy.]
Let's be randomly capable.

898
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:42,480
[The memory extinction power.]
[Erase people's memory.]

899
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,610
The important thing is the
powers that you have unleashed.

900
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:49,280
- It's the soul exchange power.
- What is that?

901
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,420
This is a power that can
switch your name tags.

902
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:58,390
Ha Ha can become Joo Yup,
and Joo Yup becomes Ha Ha.

903
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:02,130
If you use it, then that means
Joo Yup can eliminate name tags.

904
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:06,100
- That's a pretty great power.
- It is great.

905
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:09,770
- Is there a time limit?
- It's for three minutes.

906
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:12,620
You can't even go to the
bathroom in three minutes.

907
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:16,440
You can use it three times.

908
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,250
So you can use a total
of nine minutes.

909
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:23,150
However, there's a spell you have
to say to activate the power.

910
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:25,850
This is how you do it.

911
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:31,130
Shake it, shake it.
Let's shake it up, soul!

912
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:36,000
Shake it, shake it.
Let's shake it up, exchange!

913
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,330
After this...

914
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:40,700
I'm not going to use my power!

915
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:43,800
- What is this?
- Don't be angry.

916
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,910
- You have to do this.
- You want me to do that?

917
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:48,770
You're definitely going to do it.

918
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:51,810
Shake it, shake it.
Let's shake it up!

919
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:55,480
Be careful of your pronunciation!

920
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:58,050
Oh, I'm drooling.

921
00:49:58,050 --> 00:50:03,520
[The soul exchange power.]
[Joo Yup becomes Ha Ha for a while.]

922
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:17,650
[The Battle for the Strongest, start!]

923
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:20,080
We need to hurry and
find the bamboo case.

924
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:23,960
I'm nothing without it.

925
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:27,110
I'm totally useless.

926
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:31,350
- Let's go this way.
- This is Jin Ho's hero item.

927
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:35,250
[The attacking keyboard.]
It's a real keyboard.

928
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:40,990
We need to find the computer
more than anything.

929
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:42,730
Keyboard attack!

930
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:46,230
Oust Kim Jong Kook, enter!

931
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:49,110
You're really fast!

932
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:51,930
Kim Jong Kook, Kim Jong Kook.

933
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:56,130
I can do it with my eyes closed.
[Kim Jong Kook, Kim Jong Kook.]

934
00:50:57,070 --> 00:50:59,050
Do we start looking for it here?

935
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:02,620
- We can look anywhere?
- Yes, ours is the purple sticker.

936
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:05,530
Purple sticker...

937
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:07,710
It's hard to find...

938
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:09,930
Oh, there's an 'R' sticker.

939
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:11,990
This is what it looks like.
Come, I'll show you.

940
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:13,880
It's Green Team's case.

941
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,560
This is easy, isn't it?

942
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,680
It's here!
Never mind, it's orange.

943
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,990
[How come it's so easy
to spot others'?]

944
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:24,130
Where could it be?

945
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:27,970
- We need to find it...
- We're doomed if we don't find any.

946
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:30,620
We have no strength whatsoever.

947
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:34,910
[Team Green and Orange met
while looking for their cases.]

948
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:37,360
Why are you following us?

949
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:41,110
I think our two teams are the weakest.

950
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:43,650
- Where?
- Who?

951
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:45,620
Us?
Why?

952
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:48,730
I'm really sorry, but let's look at
this in a realistic point of view.

953
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:51,480
If we just look at the heroes' powers

954
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,080
you're either last place
or second to last place.

955
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:57,790
Do you even know what my power is?

956
00:51:57,790 --> 00:52:00,930
- What are you saying?
- Do you want some of this?

957
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:04,650
Should I put your teeth
instead of keys in here?

958
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:09,050
- Just be careful!
- Do you want to use your power, Jin Ho?

959
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:12,080
Look at me, Jin Ho.
If I punch you...

960
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:15,420
- you'll lose at least three teeth!
- Just show him your power!

961
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:19,090
If Yeon Koung spikes you...

962
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:22,020
your teeth and his teeth
will be switched!

963
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:27,360
They will be switched in the air!

964
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,530
I hope you'd survive till the end.

965
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:34,740
- Yeon Koung, show them your jump spike.
- How can I do it here?

966
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:37,340
[A long provocation]

967
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,780
[A short provocation]

968
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,550
[The provocation in perfect harmony!]

969
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,220
Then, I'll gently do it.

970
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:52,990
[Wait, really?]

971
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:56,620
[This is how she plays.]

972
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:00,190
[Will they be okay?]

973
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:03,100
Don't hit me!

974
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:07,000
[Scared]

975
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:12,810
[He's cute.]
You know what you did?

976
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:16,510
[I think I'll have nightmares tonight.]

977
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:18,740
Should I use my power?
Should I?

978
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:21,450
We can use our power, too!

979
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:25,160
Are you a referee?
[What's the whistle?]

980
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,990
[Everyone is nervous to see his whistle.]
I'll stop here.

981
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:30,060
His power must be really powerful.

982
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:33,160
If you keep doing that, we will...

983
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:36,290
[Shake it, shake it?]
Don't do it.

984
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:39,570
[They don't know each other skills,
so they're making up their movements.]

985
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,710
You know what happens if
I blow it one more time.

986
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:50,240
- I was really surprised!
- Me, too.

987
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:56,410
He's good at bluffing.

988
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:59,950
My nickname is Song Bluff.

989
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:03,120
Why did you blow it so hard?

990
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:07,630
I'm sweaty, do you see it?
[Everyone is fooled.]

991
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:10,590
[Song Bluff doesn't stop.]

992
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,960
[Their target is
Kwang Soo and Jin Ho.]

993
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,670
What are you doing?

994
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:18,590
Let's not do this.

995
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:21,910
[They're puzzled to see the whistle.]
Please calm down.

996
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:32,880
- What do I do?
- It's so much fun!

997
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,280
Don't do it to us!

998
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,230
We should've found at least one by now.

999
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:44,250
They usually hide around
desks like these.

1000
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:50,430
[They found a green bamboo case.]

1001
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:53,200
You scared me!

1002
00:54:55,970 --> 00:55:00,980
[In this bamboo case,
there's an 'Alt' key.]

1003
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:05,960
<i>'Ctrl,' 'Alt,' and 'Delete'
are separated and hidden.</i>

1004
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:08,450
<i>You have to find all three.</i>

1005
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:11,790
<i>Then find the only computer
you can connect your keyboard.</i>

1006
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:15,190
[They must have found it.]

1007
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:21,600
[They become confident
by finding the 'Alt' key.]

1008
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,870
Something might come out!

1009
00:55:23,870 --> 00:55:27,740
Run, run away!
[Stop there!]

1010
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:30,640
I can't see it!

1011
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,640
- Write his name!
- I need to see it first!

1012
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:37,680
[We don't know what it is,
but it's scary.]

1013
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,620
[Good riddance!]

1014
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:45,220
[After finding the 'Alt',
they feel they've all but won.]

1015
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:51,120
Look, it's a golden color.
That's for the 'Ctrl' key.

1016
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:53,800
[He puts the 'Alt' key in its place.]

1017
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:04,200
What's that?
This is amazing!

1018
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:06,940
I think it happens
every time you put a key.

1019
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:09,610
Two more left!

1020
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:12,310
Are we in a mysterious world?

1021
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:18,750
I found the red case!

1022
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:22,590
- Wow, amazing!
- It's the red one.

1023
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:24,120
This is ours!

1024
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:26,990
It's awesome!

1025
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:29,260
[Inside, there're red cards.]

1026
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:32,500
What do we do now?

1027
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:35,830
We need to find it quickly.

1028
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:38,540
- Did you find it?
- Yes, I did!

1029
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:41,310
[Jae Suk and Yeon Koung find the case.]

1030
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:49,710
- What's that?
- Let's go.

1031
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:52,920
They're all dead!

1032
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:56,120
Let's pretend we didn't find it.

1033
00:56:59,930 --> 00:57:03,390
- All we can do it is nothing.
- Yeah, me, too.

1034
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:07,430
If we reveal our power,
it's too disadvantageous for us.

1035
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:11,270
<i>Ji Hyo... I'm serious.</i>

1036
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:14,670
<i>Let's just...</i>

1037
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:19,510
- Should we attack them?
- Attack?

1038
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:22,880
It's about time
anyone should be ousted.

1039
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:29,820
[We need to do that?]

1040
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:37,990
[The spell is too corny
just to watch...]

1041
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,560
<i>I'm not going to use my power!</i>

1042
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:43,730
<i>[At that moment, it seemed
I didn't need the power.]</i>

1043
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:47,370
- Should we?
- Let's do it.

1044
00:57:47,370 --> 00:57:52,540
Quickly, shake it, shake it!
Let's shake it up!

1045
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:54,330
Soul!

1046
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:56,210
[Joo Yup, this is the moment!]

1047
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:58,880
No...

1048
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,490
[How can I do this?]

1049
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:08,320
Shake it, shake it!
Let's shake it up!

1050
00:58:08,330 --> 00:58:10,830
Exchange!
[He did it perfectly!]

1051
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:13,500
[Soul exchange!]

1052
00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:27,680
<i>This is a power that can
switch your name tags.</i>

1053
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:31,410
<i>Ha Ha can become Joo Yup,
and Joo Yup becomes Ha Ha.</i>

1054
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:36,080
<i>If you use it, then that means Joo Yup
can eliminate name tags.</i>

1055
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:40,390
<i>- That's a pretty great power.
- It is great.</i>

1056
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:43,760
[Joo Yup's name tag
is on Ha Ha's back.]

1057
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,700
[And Ha Ha's name tag
is on Joo Yup's back.]

1058
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:49,960
[Joo Yup is reborn as Ha Ha.]

1059
00:58:49,970 --> 00:58:52,500
<i>It remains for three minutes.</i>

1060
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:56,770
Don't be too aggressive.
Should I eliminate Gary?

1061
00:58:56,770 --> 00:59:01,540
[The Giant Haroro is on the move!]

1062
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:06,380
That's too harsh...

1063
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:10,880
- Raphaella?
- Isn't that a girl's name?

1064
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:15,120
[Now, who should I attack?]

1065
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:17,890
Should I eliminate Jae Suk?

1066
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:21,360
[Their first target is Yoo Jae Suk.]

1067
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:27,500
- Who?
- Soo Ji found their case.

1068
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,140
Look, she has it.

1069
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:34,410
[This is the chance!]

1070
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:41,150
[Grab]

1071
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:45,780
[Yeon Koung defends in a flash!]
[The sudden attack fails!]

1072
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:49,520
[What's going on?]
I was just kidding!

1073
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:52,320
[Should I try?]
I'm sorry, my body just moves.

1074
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:54,760
- He wanted to see.
- You're not supposed to!

1075
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:57,960
[Heroes can't eliminate name tags,
but he's Ha Ha now.]

1076
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:01,700
- Just kidding.
- Mister, put it back!

1077
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,300
Don't joke around.

1078
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:07,240
- He scared me!
- Me, too!

1079
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:08,910
I was thinking what's going on?

1080
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:13,790
Why don't you use your power
on Kwang Soo?

1081
01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:15,390
[His second attempt.]

1082
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:21,350
[What is he doing?]

1083
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:25,390
What's wrong with you?
[He moves in slow motion.]

1084
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:27,790
He's weird.

1085
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:30,690
He's weird.
Stop it!

1086
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:34,570
[Slow and naive,
Brother Turtle]

1087
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:38,430
- We don't have to stay here.
- Let's separate now.

1088
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:41,710
Don't we need to decide
on the next target?

1089
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:47,140
[They step backward
for hiding their name tags.]

1090
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:52,480
What are you doing?

1091
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,850
[He lured him successfully.]

1092
01:00:55,850 --> 01:00:59,760
Please don't do that.
[They're alone.]

1093
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:04,620
[Grabs]
[He seals off the hero.]

1094
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:09,510
[Go, Giant Ha Ha!]

1095
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:11,960
- What is it?
- Attack Gary!

1096
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:17,160
[What is he doing?]

1097
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:24,530
[What just happened?]
He's a hero.

1098
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:28,620
What is he doing?
What is it?

1099
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:31,890
[They wouldn't know they're switched,
would they?]

1100
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:35,340
<i>Gary is ousted,
Gary is ousted!</i>

1101
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,390
[The other teams are agitated.]

1102
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:41,080
It must be Ha Ha.

1103
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,500
You mean Ha Ha ousted Gary?

1104
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:46,220
What do you mean I'm ousted?
No, Joo Yup did it.

1105
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:48,590
What is it?

1106
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:52,310
[You should have checked his name tag.]

1107
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:56,050
[That was his power?]

1108
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:58,590
I'm sorry, let me
explain the situation.

1109
01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:05,740
[Suk Jin, I think it's time...]

1110
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,510
[Yes, this is the moment!]

1111
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:17,260
<i>Ji Suk Jin's power
is the memory extinction.</i>

1112
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:18,960
<i>You know the fart bombs.</i>

1113
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:22,330
<i>Everyone who smells it
will lose their memory.</i>

1114
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:26,910
<i>If the hero uses his powers
after Gary is ousted</i>

1115
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:32,390
<i>the people will lose their memory
and forget Gary was ousted.</i>

1116
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:38,680
[This is the moment
for the fart bombs!]

1117
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:41,910
The memory extinction!

1118
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:44,280
[Huh?
The memory extinction?]

1119
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,280
[You'll see what it is.]

1120
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:49,340
The memory extinction!

1121
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:58,100
[Whoever smells this
will loose their memory.]

1122
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:00,410
The smell!
It's awful!

1123
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:07,010
[What a terrible smell!]

1124
01:03:08,010 --> 01:03:11,510
[Everyone is surrounded by
the odor of the fart bombs.]

1125
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:19,280
- Hello!
- How have you been?

1126
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:23,250
We need to be careful
because we're in a battle.

1127
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:27,960
- Did anything happened?
- You're sweating a lot.

1128
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:31,310
Where did you come from?

1129
01:03:31,310 --> 01:03:35,480
- From that side.
- You're Ha Ha, right?

1130
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,550
[Wait for us...]
I thought I saw three letters.

1131
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:42,310
No, I'm Ha Ha.

1132
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:44,950
What was that?

1133
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:49,650
[Three minutes passed, and the
name tags are back to its place.]

1134
01:03:54,340 --> 01:04:00,020
[Don't be too relaxed,
we have two more chances.]

1135
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:06,110
[Kwang Soo and Jin Ho
are still searching.]

1136
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:09,390
Here it is!
I found it!

1137
01:04:09,390 --> 01:04:11,590
There are 'Alt' keys everywhere.

1138
01:04:12,670 --> 01:04:16,680
It's the control key!

1139
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:19,960
Please, please!
I hope it's not 'Alt.'

1140
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:23,020
[But it's the 'Ctrl' key again.]

1141
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:25,450
- Jin Ho!
- Did you find it?

1142
01:04:25,450 --> 01:04:28,280
- Jin Ho!
- Where are you?

1143
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,800
[Hope it's delete key...]

1144
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:37,360
[Joy to the world,
the 'delete' is come!]

1145
01:04:38,930 --> 01:04:41,080
[They've completed
the attacking keyboard!]

1146
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:46,360
Wow, it's done!
[Their acting gets better.]

1147
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:50,710
Let's find the computer now.

1148
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:54,650
[There's only one computer
in this huge building.]

1149
01:04:54,650 --> 01:04:57,360
- We shouldn't go to the other building.
- It's Jong Kook!

1150
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:00,790
[Nice to see you!]

1151
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:04,590
Where are you going?
[They make a u-turn.]

1152
01:05:04,590 --> 01:05:08,050
- Where are you going?
- We're searching.

1153
01:05:08,050 --> 01:05:10,820
- What are you searching?
- A computer.

1154
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:14,280
- I know where the computer is.
- Let's go together.

1155
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:17,820
- Tell us where it is.
- Don't oust us, then.

1156
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:21,450
- Of course not!
- Why would we oust you?

1157
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:23,530
You know me.

1158
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:26,390
Then, follow me.
I found where it is.

1159
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:32,560
I saw the computer.
Don't write my name.

1160
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:35,140
[They follow Jong Kook,
but what's going on?]

1161
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:38,250
Kwang Soo, come over here.

1162
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:43,160
- Open the door.
- It's here?

1163
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:47,020
On your left.
[There it is!]

1164
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:48,850
How come we couldn't find it?

1165
01:05:48,850 --> 01:05:50,530
I told you!

1166
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:54,840
- Connect the keyboard.
- Don't force him.

1167
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:57,990
- Don't push me.
- Sit down.

1168
01:05:57,990 --> 01:06:00,450
I'm only going to watch him.

1169
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:04,960
- People treated us unfairly.
- Just connect it first.

1170
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,050
Let us boss around others.

1171
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:10,390
[When they don't listen,
he starts threatening them.]

1172
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:13,850
- Do you want to boss around?
- I'm untying my keyboard.

1173
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:16,960
I'm un... untying it!

1174
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,740
Hurry up and connect the keyboard!

1175
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:28,080
Hold him tight.
[I've never been in front of a tiger.]

1176
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:30,590
Why are you shaking?

1177
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:34,080
How can you be actually scared?
He's not even acting!

1178
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:37,850
What do you think is faster?
You writing my name, or me eliminate him.

1179
01:06:37,850 --> 01:06:40,710
[What should I do?]

1180
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:43,450
I feel much better
sitting at the computer.

1181
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:46,450
You're not sweating any more!

1182
01:06:47,890 --> 01:06:52,330
- He's just practicing.
- I'll eliminate his name tag!

1183
01:06:52,330 --> 01:06:57,530
- He's not that fast.
- I'll rip this tag when you type 'Kim.'

1184
01:06:57,530 --> 01:07:02,740
This is it.
[Ha]

1185
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:05,650
I think we should start using the item.

1186
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:09,580
Wear your glove.
Shout the spell here.

1187
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:14,390
- What was it?
- 'Name cloning!'

1188
01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:19,420
<i>After shouting it</i>

1189
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:23,450
<i>for example, if it's Kim Jong Kook,
slap his back with a spike.</i>

1190
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:27,480
<i>From that moment on, Jong Kook's
name tag will be on Jae Suk's back.</i>

1191
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:32,560
<i>You have to ask someone else
to eliminate it within a minute.</i>

1192
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:37,360
<i>After the minute passes, your name
tag will return on your back.</i>

1193
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:38,910
<i>Within a minute...</i>

1194
01:07:38,910 --> 01:07:42,880
[Who will be the one
to feel Yeon Koung's spike?]

1195
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:45,710
Loud?

1196
01:07:45,710 --> 01:07:49,360
'Name cloning!'

1197
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:53,120
[Now she needs to slap someone
to clone their name tags.]

1198
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:57,050
[The two teams are allied.]
I think someone has 'Reflection.'

1199
01:07:57,050 --> 01:08:00,110
I think so, too.
[There're people near here.]

1200
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:02,340
I think someone has
the reflection power.

1201
01:08:04,070 --> 01:08:06,460
[Jae Suk and Yeon Koung
were hiding at the door.]

1202
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:11,710
[The two teams attack them
since they outnumber the two.]

1203
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:16,110
[Ha Ha bravely approaches.]

1204
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:20,420
[This is the moment!]

1205
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:24,190
[Volleyball spike!]

1206
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:35,080
[Yoo Jae Suk has Ha Ha's name tag.]

1207
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:37,790
[They have one minute!]
Eliminate me!

1208
01:08:37,790 --> 01:08:40,360
Eliminate me now!

1209
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:44,870
[Ha Ha and Joo Yup
don't know what's going on.]

1210
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:48,760
Are you sure?

1211
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:51,450
- Hurry up and rip it off!
- You're sure?

1212
01:08:53,110 --> 01:08:55,750
[The name cloning worked!]

1213
01:08:55,750 --> 01:08:58,420
What's your power?

1214
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:03,420
It worked!
[What just happened?]

1215
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:06,790
- Run, run!
- Wait.

1216
01:09:06,790 --> 01:09:11,930
- What is it?
- You're ousted.

1217
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:13,280
What?

1218
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:15,960
What was that?

1219
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:17,910
<i>Ha Ha is ousted.</i>

1220
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:21,020
[That's my hero's power.]
What is that?

1221
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:25,680
- When I slap your back...
- Did you slap me?

1222
01:09:26,590 --> 01:09:29,980
Thank you for your hard work,
Super Power.

1223
01:09:29,980 --> 01:09:33,530
It's full of betrayal.

1224
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:37,910
[Ha Ha is ousted.]
What?

1225
01:09:37,910 --> 01:09:40,850
Well, you have less choices now.

1226
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:45,530
Then I'll write Gary's name.
Let's work together.

1227
01:09:45,530 --> 01:09:49,360
- Don't betray us!
- Don't you know me?

1228
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:51,820
I'll write Gary's name for sure.

1229
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:54,640
[He wrote 'Ga' this time.]

1230
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:58,330
[At that moment, Gary is...]

1231
01:09:58,330 --> 01:10:02,330
[stopped by Ji Hyo and Jong Kook.]
Temporary sending-off.

1232
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:04,180
- What is it?
- Sending-off!

1233
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:07,350
[Lift]

1234
01:10:08,290 --> 01:10:11,220
[If they place the red card
on the Running Man member's sock]

1235
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:13,730
[the hero will be
kicked out for 15 minutes.]

1236
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:15,960
Run away!

1237
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:18,800
- No!
- I took off his shoe!

1238
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:23,850
[Jong Kook put
the red card on his foot!]

1239
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:32,850
[Suk Jin has been sent off.]
I had no choice.

1240
01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:35,310
What just happened?

1241
01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:39,320
You followed us
thinking we don't have any items.

1242
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:43,140
It's fine.
You need to oust me, Ji Hyo.

1243
01:10:45,310 --> 01:10:49,090
Here, Ji Hyo.
Eliminate me!

1244
01:10:49,090 --> 01:10:52,510
[I can be resurrected
at a cost of fart.]

1245
01:10:52,510 --> 01:10:56,960
Our power is to send off your hero.

1246
01:10:58,370 --> 01:11:01,190
[Huh?]
[Wait a second...]

1247
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:06,130
Your hero is out of the building.
He can't come back for 15 minutes.

1248
01:11:06,130 --> 01:11:08,590
- Where is he?
- He'll be outside.

1249
01:11:10,010 --> 01:11:13,020
[He realized the situation.]
Wait!

1250
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:17,050
Where did my hero go?

1251
01:11:17,050 --> 01:11:19,160
No!

1252
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:22,680
No!
[Gary is ousted.]

1253
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:25,220
Ji Suk Jin!

1254
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:29,760
I'm so sorry, Gary.
[I want to smell the fart...]

1255
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:34,680
<i>Gary is ousted.</i>

1256
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:38,610
It's because we've been
facing each other.

1257
01:11:38,610 --> 01:11:41,790
We've kept our pose for a while now!

1258
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:46,480
[This time, he wrote 'Yoo.]

1259
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:50,130
Now, we've reached Yoo.

1260
01:11:50,130 --> 01:11:53,050
- Okay, I'll write it this time.
- Really?

1261
01:11:53,050 --> 01:11:57,360
- Who are the survivors?
- Ji Hyo's team and Jae Suk's...

1262
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:03,850
What's going on here?

1263
01:12:03,850 --> 01:12:08,620
[As soon as he enters the room,
they start threatening them.]

1264
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:12,590
[Yoo Jae]
Don't provoke me!

1265
01:12:12,590 --> 01:12:14,650
Calm down.

1266
01:12:14,650 --> 01:12:17,310
- I'm going to type 'S!'
- Why us?

1267
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:23,950
- It's either Ji Hyo or Jae Suk...
- But you can't type here.

1268
01:12:23,950 --> 01:12:27,420
Jin Ho, you need to escape.

1269
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:29,720
Yes, Jong Kook.

1270
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:33,280
If you can't escape,
I'll eliminate his name tag!

1271
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:37,710
What situation is this?
[I want to go home!]

1272
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:40,130
Show your will to escape, at least.

1273
01:12:40,130 --> 01:12:42,360
Who orders that around?

1274
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:45,650
Wait, both of you're afraid
if I'm going to write your name.

1275
01:12:45,650 --> 01:12:49,450
I'll write Ji Hyo's name.
Then the three teams will be left.

1276
01:12:49,450 --> 01:12:52,020
[They've come to a conclusion.]
[Song Ji]

1277
01:12:54,050 --> 01:12:55,910
Should I really eliminate her?

1278
01:12:55,910 --> 01:12:59,190
We're gathered here.
What else can you do?

1279
01:12:59,190 --> 01:13:02,560
[I'm sorry.]
I'll act if there's no announcement.

1280
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:06,120
- I'm serious.
- I can't give up on you.

1281
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:09,530
[Jin Ho, look at my tongue.]

1282
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:15,340
[Do you want me to write Kkuk's name?]

1283
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:19,650
[Kim\Jo]

1284
01:13:21,010 --> 01:13:24,010
[He was going to write
Kim Jong Kook quickly.]

1285
01:13:24,010 --> 01:13:26,250
[He keeps making typos.]
What are you doing?

1286
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:28,760
Wait, wait!

1287
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:32,990
[Song Ji Hyo]
[He goes back to Ji Hyo's name.]

1288
01:13:32,990 --> 01:13:37,730
- I saw you typed my name.
- Just to make it fun.

1289
01:13:37,730 --> 01:13:40,620
Just kidding!

1290
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:43,310
Why are you so bad at typing?

1291
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:45,910
[Former Professional gamer
makes so many typos.]

1292
01:13:45,910 --> 01:13:48,310
Because it's not my keyboard.

1293
01:13:48,310 --> 01:13:50,170
How many times did you practice?

1294
01:13:50,170 --> 01:13:52,190
You wrote it with your
eyes closed before!

1295
01:13:52,190 --> 01:13:54,400
- Keep your promise, Jong Kook!
- Of course!

1296
01:13:56,730 --> 01:13:59,160
She's going to be ousted!

1297
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:02,590
Keyboard attack!

1298
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:05,720
[He presses the enter key.]

1299
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:09,680
Keyboard attack,
oust Song Ji Hyo!

1300
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:18,060
[Oust Song Ji Hyo!]

1301
01:14:21,050 --> 01:14:24,190
<i>Song Ji Hyo is ousted.</i>

1302
01:14:25,470 --> 01:14:27,130
Lee Kwang Soo...

1303
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:31,080
- Is this how it is?
- Lee Kwang Soo!

1304
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:34,510
[This is a scary place.]

1305
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:42,730
[Only three teams are left.]

1306
01:14:42,730 --> 01:14:46,080
- We're the only teams.
- Oh, really?

1307
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:49,420
The survivors are all here.

1308
01:14:51,490 --> 01:14:55,450
Let's just separate.

1309
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:59,070
[Jae Suk, you know what I mean?]

1310
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:03,850
Kwang Soo, did you
just look at Jae Suk?

1311
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:13,820
I caught him!
[Launch the plan!]

1312
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:16,930
[Seize the tiger!]

1313
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:19,680
Hurry up, Yeon Koung!

1314
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:24,360
[Yeon Koung was about to spike Kkuk...]

1315
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:27,680
Ribbon teleportation!

1316
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:34,400
[They can teleport
when she swirls the ribbon.]

1317
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:41,590
It was really close!

1318
01:15:44,810 --> 01:15:46,130
I knew it.

1319
01:15:46,130 --> 01:15:49,560
[Thanks to Soo Ji, he survived,
but they attacked me together?]

1320
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:54,220
[Kwang Goo and Jin Ho
are searching for the keys again.]

1321
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:58,130
[They found 'Alt' key before.]

1322
01:15:58,140 --> 01:16:01,260
[Where are you, Ctrl, Del?]

1323
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:04,850
[Jae Suk and Yeon Koung
help them, too.]

1324
01:16:04,850 --> 01:16:06,590
[The only way to oust Kkuk.]

1325
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:12,340
[Jae Suk and Yeon Koung
find the green case.]

1326
01:16:14,210 --> 01:16:17,940
[Now... how should I attack them?]

1327
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:22,510
[Please, please, please.]

1328
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:24,820
- Jin Ho!
- Did you find it?

1329
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:31,280
[They acquire the Ctrl' key!]

1330
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:34,650
[Go that way!]

1331
01:16:36,660 --> 01:16:40,390
[Thanks to Jae Suk and Yeon Koung,
they found the 'Del' key.]

1332
01:16:40,390 --> 01:16:42,250
- Keep your promise.
- Don't worry.

1333
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:48,390
[They made another attacking keyboard.]

1334
01:16:49,710 --> 01:16:53,020
[Now, go straight to the computer!]

1335
01:16:56,130 --> 01:16:59,820
I think they're trying to oust us
by making another keyboard.

1336
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:04,560
Let's just go back
to the room with the computer.

1337
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:10,280
It should be around here.

1338
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:15,170
[He found it.]
There's no one!

1339
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:25,980
- Why did they lock it?
- Why?

1340
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:27,790
Are you trying to write my name?

1341
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:31,050
[Open the door!]

1342
01:17:31,050 --> 01:17:34,680
[Oust Kim Jong Kook.]
Did you write it?

1343
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:37,330
[I'm on my way to eliminate you.]

1344
01:17:37,330 --> 01:17:42,220
If you write my name,
Jong Kook will win this battle.

1345
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:47,730
- One of the teams will be left.
- Yes, let's just spend the night.

1346
01:17:47,730 --> 01:17:50,110
One will be eliminated eventually.

1347
01:17:50,110 --> 01:17:52,880
I don't have to go home.
I have nothing to do tomorrow.

1348
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:56,310
[Just fight each other.]

1349
01:17:59,110 --> 01:18:02,010
[Jae Suk and Yeon Koung
changed their mind.]

1350
01:18:02,850 --> 01:18:04,910
They locked the door.

1351
01:18:04,910 --> 01:18:08,450
They're waiting for you to eliminate me.
Then, they just write your name.

1352
01:18:10,350 --> 01:18:13,880
- Is that so?
- Yes, they locked the door.

1353
01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:23,160
- Are they fighting?
- I don't hear any sound.

1354
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:25,110
Maybe they already left.

1355
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:28,160
If they fight somewhere,
one team will remain.

1356
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:30,140
Then, they will announce the result.

1357
01:18:31,870 --> 01:18:35,180
- I need to go to bathroom.
- No! Just pee here.

1358
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:39,820
[Use that.]
[An empty water bottle]

1359
01:18:41,010 --> 01:18:42,680
[Quiet]

1360
01:18:52,420 --> 01:18:54,660
- Just take a peek.
- No!

1361

1374
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:49,340

[Kwang Soo runs
straight to the washroom.]

1386
