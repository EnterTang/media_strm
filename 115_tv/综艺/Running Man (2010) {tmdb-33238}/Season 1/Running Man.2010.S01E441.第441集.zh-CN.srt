爸爸！
Vater!

5
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,620
该死……真他妈的该死！
Bloody hell... Bloody, bloody hell!

6
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,540
医生说 没有尸体他不来
The doctor says he won't come until he has a body, sir.

7
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,380
什么 什么 他认为底下就只眼球而已？
What? What, he thinks it's just an eyeball down there?

8
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,780
有人靠着码头掉下去了？
Somebody leaned over the quay and it dropped out?

他说死要见尸 头儿
He says he needs a body, sir.

10

不可理喻
Unbelievable.

跟他说我们有了
Tell him we've got one.

13
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,780
要通知詹特利总督察吗
Shouldn't we call out Chief Inspector Gently?

14
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,980
不必 他休息 好了
No, no. He's on leave. Right.

15
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,260
继续 医生
Go on, Doctor.

16

Well, who is in charge? It's all right, I'm in charge. How can I help?

昨晚起我就没见着我父亲 好了
I am missing my father since last night. OK, right.

20
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:59,740
我们在这儿碰面 一起上船 我就听说水里有具尸体
Since we are to come here, to meet and go on our boat and I am hearing now there is a body in the water!

21
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,580
呃 是 请问尊姓大名 先生
Er, yeah. Can I take your name please, sir?

我是警探长约翰・巴克斯
I'm Detective Sergeant John Bacchus.

25
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,180

I have no need to talk to you... I wish to speak to the commanding officer.

27
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:20,820
-我是负责人 史迈克先生 -你？-是 -不 区区一个警长？
I am in charge, Mr Schmeikel. You? Yeah. No. A mere sergeant?

28
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,020
警探长 实际上
Detective sergeant, actually.

29
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,220
不不不……你不明白
No, no no...you do not understand.

30
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,140
-我父亲失踪了 他是重要人物 非常重要 -是 我们尽力
My father is missing. He's an important man, very important. Yeah. We'll try our best.

31
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:36,460
不不 还不够好 无法接受…… 威尔海姆！那是冈特
No, no. That's not good enough. It's unacceptable... Wilhelm! Das ist Gunter.

32
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:41,300
先生 先生 先生 求你了 我要…… 抱歉 亲爱的
Sir. Sir, sir. Please, I need to... Excuse me, sorry, pet.

33

你能告诉我那个被找到的男人……
Can you just tell me the man that's been recovered...

34
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,220
是我的岳父…… 威尔海姆的父亲
Is my father-in-law... It's Wilhelm's father...

35
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,540
冈特・史迈克！冈特・史迈克
Gunter Schmeikel! Gunter Schmeikel.

36
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,700
为什么不叫我
Why didn't you call me?

37
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,100
因为三十分钟前它只是个不明眼球
Because 30 seconds ago it was just an unidentified eyeball.

38
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,220
我以为你休息呢
I thought you were on leave?

39
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,820
现在不了 不了 好吧 好吧
Not now, I'm not. Right. Right.

40
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,900
那么 有我的事了吗
Is there anything I can do, then?

41
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,060
敢情来杯茶？
Get you a cup of tea, perhaps?

42
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,180
不 谢了 看尸体
No, thanks. Look at the body.

43
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,700
呃 眼球被渔民钩出来了
Well, the eyeball was hooked out by a fisherman.

44
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,540
不是说眼球 重点错 警长
Not talking about the eyeball, Sergeant.

45
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,860
他扭曲得没人形了 是 会到那步的 看他的手 看到什么没
He's all twisted. Yeah, we'll get to that. Look at his hands. What do you see?

46
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,980
没 表明什么
Nothing. What's that tell you?

47
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,940
他没做挣扎
He didn't struggle.

48
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:35,420
是 因为如果试图逃生的话他会把手撕碎的 但他没有
Yeah, because he would have torn his hands to shreds trying to get out of here, but he didn't.

49
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,300
把他翻个身
Turn him over.

50
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,340
把夹克和衬衫拉上来
Pull up his jacket and shirt.

51
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,740
脊椎断了
That spine's been snapped.

52
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:50,980
没挣扎是因为他在这一重击下瘫痪了
He didn't struggle because the attack paralysed him.

53
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,980
-意思是他在入水前还是活着的 -正确
Meaning he was alive when he entered the water. Correct.

54
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,260
叫医生别来了吗
？Shall I call off the doctor, then?

55
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,140
我来推定死亡时间 赌一把？
I'll have a stab at the time of death, if you like. You fancy a bet?

56
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,780
十或十二个小时
Ten or twelve hours.

57
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,300
好吧 算上我了
All right, you're on.

58
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:11,260
-所以你就是路过 是吧？-呃 你知道的
So you were just passing then, were you? Well, you know.

59
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,700
我在车站扫了一眼 是的
I had a look in at the station, yeah.

60
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,820
那周你休假？
On your week off?

61
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,820
我们有人了吗
We got a name yet?

62
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,500
是的 冈特・史迈克
Yeah. Gunter Schmeikel.

63
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,380
那是什么 德国人 澳洲佬 还是瑞士的
What's that, German, Austrian, Swiss?

64
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,220
呃 反正不是东北人 是不
Well, it's not Geordie, is it?

65
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,420
泰勒正在跟他的儿子儿媳说话
Taylor's talking to his son and his daughter-in-law...

66
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,780
他们估计那儿的船是他的
They reckon that's his boat over there.

67
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,740
干得漂亮
Very nice.

68
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,380
钱包呢还是现金？
Any wallet or cash?

69
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,060
没 只有这个
No. Just this.

70
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,300
肯定花了不少钱 这个
Must've cost a few bob, this.

71
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,220
有些还好
All right for some.

72
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,020

It says here they left Hamburg six days ago.

75
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,140
我德语O级
I did German 'O' level.

76
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,700
全班领先
Top of me class.

77
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,900
哟 那我可松了口气
Well, that's a relief.

You never said they were suspects. Well, of course they're suspects, man.

Some folks in the crowd said that the deceased was drinking

94
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,540
呃 你怎么把婴儿车塞进名爵的
Well, how do you fit a pram into an MG?

95

塞不下就不要硬撑
Three into two does not go.

96

你不介意我听吧 头儿？
D'you mind if I listen in, Guv?

101
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,540

Saying what?

107
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,540
这个嘛有点难度 在你看不到唇部动作的时候
Well, it's a bit tricky, isn't it, when you can't see the lips moving?

108
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,780
或者是因为说话的人没长一张天使脸蛋？
Or if the speaker doesn't have the face of an angel?

109
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,420
麻烦打断他
Interrupt him, please.

Yes, I have a Detective Gently for yer.

114
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,460
总探长 这才像话
Chief Inspector. This is more like it.

115
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,260
无意冒犯 警长
No offence intended, Sergeant.

116

我父亲整晚都在和他所谓的……
My father had been drinking all evening with his so-called...

121
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:03,940
朋友们喝酒……然后我就想他是不是想到小船里去……还有
friends...and, I'm imagining him trying to get into the dinghy...and, well,

122
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:10,180
他进去了 如果我告诉你们我们觉得他的背断了呢
in he goes. What if I told you we think his back was broken?

123
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,140
亲爱的上帝啊
Lieber Gott.

124
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,940
-你没事吧 史迈克夫人？-没事
Are you all right, Mrs Schmeikel? Yes.

125
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,660
现在 你提到过你父亲来头不小
Now, you mentioned that your father was important.

126
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,420
他在不来梅市有一家大型制药公司
He owns a large pharmaceutical company in Bremen.

127
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,220
那就让他变得重要了？
That makes him important, does it?

128
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:29,220
能告诉我你的手是怎么回事吗 史迈克先生？
Can you tell me what happened to your hands, Mr Schmeikel?

129
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:35,260
这个 这是在北海不擅航行付出的代价
This. This you get from the North Sea when you're no good at sailing!

130
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,100
荒谬！整个一出闹剧！
Ridiculous! This whole thing is ridiculous.

131
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,660
哪里荒谬了 先生？
Ridiculous in what way, sir?

132
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:45,860
我父亲 他 呃 是一名战犯 在44年空战中被击落……
My father, he, er, was a prisoner of war...shot down in '44...

133
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,060
德国空军……轰炸机飞行员……
Luftwaffe...a bomber pilot...

134
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,780
然后就获编了？
and, then... billeted?

135
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,820
获编了 对
Billeted, yeah.

136
00:08:54,820 --> 00:09:02,380
在一家农场里获编排住下了……显然 20年后我必须去拜访投宿 以便能“学会”
Billeted, yes, on a pig farm...which 20 years later I apparently must visit and stay at so I can "learn"

137
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,260
如何经营养猪场
how pig farmers do business...

138
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:10,300
所以我父亲 他待在农场……然后
So my father, he stays on the farm...and

139
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,740
-我们来这儿 你和你父亲就这事争执过吗
-we come here. Did you argue with your father over this?

140
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,420
他们无时不吵 这……
They argue all the time, it's...

141
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,980
这些养猪场农民 就是昨晚和他在酒吧的那些朋友吗
These pig farmers, are they the friends he was in the pub with last night?

142
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,900
哈德门一家 是！哈德门一家
The Hardyments, yeah! The Hardyments.

143
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,900
冈特 冈特 过来 咱们唱首虫歌 唱虫歌
Gunter, Gunter. C'mon, let's do the worm song. Do the worm song.

144
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,780
不不不 我记不得了
No, no, no, I can't remember it!

145
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:42,260
你当然记得！谁教你的 嗯？走开 老兄 让我们时光倒流二十年！
Course yer can! Who taught yer, eh? Away, man, let's wind the clock back 20 year!

146
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:47,820
别出声 伙计们 吸口气 让我告诉你一件可怕的事
?Whisht lads, hold yer gobs I'll tell yer all an awful story,

147
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:53,820
别出声 伙计们 吸口气 让我告诉你踢走虫子的事
?Whisht lads, hold yer gobs An' I'll tell yer 'boot the worm! ?
 

148 00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,220 
而你身在何处
And where were you?

148
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,900
我们在这里……我们在这里一直到十点一刻和我父亲在码头见面
We were here... We were here until we were to meet my father at the quayside at 10.15...

149
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:08,660
他坚持让我们睡在船里以便捕捉早潮
He insisted we sleep on the boat to catch an early tide.

150
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,820
所以 你昨晚离开旅馆了 什么时候？
So, you left the hotel last night, what time?

151
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,380
十点钟 对吗？十点……是
Ten o'clock, yes? Ten...ja.

152
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,900
你看见或会见什么人了吗
Did you see or meet anyone?

153
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,420
没 没人
No. No-one...

154
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,580
当我父亲半小时后还没出现 我们就回这里了
And when my father doesn't come after half an hour, we come back here.

155
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,260
你父亲有个钱包吗
Did your father have a wallet?

156
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:29,780
是的 在他夹克的内侧口袋里
Yes. The inside pocket of his jacket.

157
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,300
为什么 不见了吗
Why, it is gone?

158
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,740
是的 请问
Yes. Could I ask

159
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,900
你早前是跟谁在
who were you talking to earlier,

160
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,740
打电话？
on the phone?

161
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,940
我得通知公司……让他们知情
I had to inform the company... to let them know.

162
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,900
我岳父的员工就像一家人
My father-in-law's employees are like his family. Halt du dich da raus.

163
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:49,100
-要给你们护照吧……我这就去拿 -是的
You will be needing our passports... I will go get them for you. Yes.

164
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,060
用德语小声交谈
THEY WHISPER IN GERMAN

165
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,380
不好意思
Excuse me,

166
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,620
说英语行吗
could you speak in English, please?

167
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,100
抱歉 她英文不太好
Excuse me, her English is not good enough.

168
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,700
嗯……我必须……不择手段
Um... I must... By all means.

169
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,260
我懂德语 我只是口语不行
I can read German... I just, I can't do the oral.

170
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:31,380
可怜的老艾柯 好了
Poor old Elke. Right.

171
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,260
你一旦收集到史迈克的护照就找人追踪查尔纳的下落
Once you've collected the Schmeikels' passports, get someone to track down China...

172
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,900
不管醉醒 我要见他的人 尽快
I want him here drunk or sober, as soon as you can.

173
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,140
为什么非得他啊
Why do we need him?

174
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,620
只管照做
Just do it, please.

175
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,580
他们在杜伦的大小酒馆找查尔纳了
They're looking in all the pubs in Durham for China.

176
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,020
还有病理学家已经开膛破肚了 所以……
And the pathologist's ripping the body open already, so...

177
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,420
好了 我们到猪农那里走一趟
Right. Let's visit a pig farmer.

178
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,860
哦 好的
Oh, right.

179
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,380
一分钟
One minute.

180
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,140
他们土豪的很 有些猪农
They're pretty well off, some of these pig farmers.

181
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,820
这车一百块？ 是
A hundred quid for this car? Yeah.

182
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,620
一辆名爵一百磅 性价比高啊！-哦 可不
A hundred pound for an MG is a bargain, man! Oh, yeah,

183
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,940
那你为什么贱卖
so why are you selling it so cheap?

184
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,500
你知道的
You know.

185
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,820
不宽裕吗 警长
Have you got money problems, Sergeant?

186
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,340
没
No.

187
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:36,380
是 什么？是手头稍紧还是负债累累
Yes. What, are you just feeling the pinch, or are you actually in debt?

188
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:43,060
-你欠多少 -头儿 这没什么 我应付不了……
How much do you owe? Look, sir, it's nothing I can't manage...

189
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:47,380
-我很快就要参加探长考试了 我会过的…… -嗯 是的我肯定你能行
I'm taking my Inspector's exams soon...which I'll pass... Well, yes, I'm sure you'll pass.

190
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,780
但最近又没职位空缺
But I can't see a vacancy for an Inspector coming up in the near future.

191
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:54,060
呃 等有了我就会调到另一个部门去了
Well, then I'll transfer to another force where they've got more room.

192
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,420
更大的地方 那得多久
Somewhere bigger. And how long's that going to take?

193
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,660
看吧 头儿 一切尽在掌握
Look, Sir, it's all in hand.

194
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:04,460
是 不错……因为对负债的警察而言 遍地是诱惑
Yeah, good...because a copper in debt is open to temptation.

195
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:08,500
实际上 我反感那么做 什么？你觉得不会发生在你身上？
I resent that, actually. What? You think it can't happen to you?

196
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:13,460
屡见不鲜 多少锦绣前程就此断送
I've seen it a dozen times. A dozen promising careers ruined.

197
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,220
友情建议 仅此而已
Just trying to offer some friendly advice.

198
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,740
是 头儿 收到 “切勿负债”
Yes, sir, I heard your advice. "Don't get into debt".

199
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,500
谢您的小贴士 我都在卖车了 不是？
Thanks for the tip. I'm selling me car, aren't I?

200
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,060
抱歉抱歉
Sorry. Sorry.

201
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,260
老实讲 船到桥头自然直
Honestly, it'll all get straightened out.

202
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:41,380
我觉得史迈克夫人欲言又止
I reckon Mrs Schmeikel knows more than she's allowed to say.

203
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,020
哦 什么味道
Oh, what's that smell?!

204
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,260
鞋子……
Shoes...

205
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:04,460
你们谁啊 想干啥 警探巴克斯
Who are yous, like, and what d'yer want? Detective Sergeant Bacchus...

206
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:08,980
怎么了 爹？那个屁精是谁？公子哥似的
How, Da! Who's that flash bugger? Looks like a toff.

207
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,180
下午
Afternoon.

208
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:16,860
我是詹特利总督察 这是巴克斯警探
I'm Detective Chief Inspector Gently. This is Detective Sergeant Bacchus.

209
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,500
我们想问你一些问题 麻烦了
We'd like to ask you a few questions, please.

210
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,420
一个伦敦佬！还是大人物
A bloody Londoner! And a big-wig an' all.

211
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,580
不能更糟了！欢迎来到南北分界 先生
Gets worse and worse! Welcome to the North/South divide, sir.

212
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:29,820
好吧 我正要去用餐……所以不想在那干等的话就进来
Well, I'm just about to have me dinner...so either wait there, or away in.

213
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,500
我震惊了……
I'm shocked...shocked,

214
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,740
我很震惊
I am, I'm shocked.

215
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:48,220
是的 我们昨晚和他一起
I am. We were with him last night!

216
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,900
谁会干掉冈特？！
Who'd wanna do Gunter?!

217
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:53,580
没人……为什么他们要这样？！
Naybody...why would they?!

218
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:57,180
我们开走的时候跟他招手了
I gave him a wave as we drove off!

219
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,700
我吃不下去了
I can barely eat!

220
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,340
我能问你昨晚的事吗
Can I ask you about last night?

221
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,700
嗯 随便你问
Aye, ask what yer like, aye!

222
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,740
你去了船员休息室
You went to the Mariners.

223
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:14,380
是 怎么了
Aye! And what happened?

224
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,380
因为自从冈特被编宿以来我就没见过他了
Cos I haven't seen Gunter since he was billeted here...

225
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:21,420
但只要他一回来 就会到他的小阁楼里 仍然像个战犯
But as soon as he's back, he's back in his loft where he was as a PoW...

226
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:26,380
他在那儿睡了两晚 猪场里的各种事情他也帮忙
Two nights he slept there. He helps out with the pigs an' everything...

227
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,220
现在他是个截然不同的农民了
Him an altogether different type of farmer now...

228
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:36,620
一名制药商 是啊 一名制药商 对
A pharmaceutical man. Aye, a pharmaceutical man, that's right, aye.

229
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,540
但他做事就像二十年前那样 你知道 他乐在其中
But he mucks in like it's 20 years ago, you know, and he loves it.

230
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:44,460
我们带他去哈德良城墙……因为我教他怎么成为鸟人
We took him to Hadrian's Wall...cos I taught him to be a bird man,

231
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:49,140
很少有鸟飞来 你知道 有很多事要干
and there's rare ones flying in, you know, quite a to-do about it,

232
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:53,500
你们知道这是他的最后一晚 我们都在馆子里
and 'fore yer know it's his last night and we're all in the pub.

233
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,100
所有酒水都是他请
He's buying drinks for everybody.

234
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,700
不 真的 你已经请得够多了
No, really, already you have given enough!

235
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,420
那我明天走的时候
Then, when I'm gone, tomorrow,

236
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:08,660
全场还是算我的！一杯淡黑 先生 谢谢！
the drinks are still on me! One Black and Tan, sir. Thank you!

237
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,260
不用找了
Keep it, please.

238
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,860
唱虫歌！
Singing the Worm song!

239
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,460
是 是
Aye. Aye...

240
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,260
他现在要告诉你们虫的一切
He'll tell yer all about the worm now.

241
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:23,100
别出声 伙计们 为了请你们喝酒的男人保持呼吸 冈特・史迈克！
Whisht lads and hold yer gobs for the man who's buyin' drinks, Gunter Schmeikel!

242
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,580
必胜……必胜！
Sieg heil... Sieg heil!

243
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,660
哦诶！不要记恨 你们！
Oy! Forgive and forget, you lot!

244
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,260
否则我扇你巴掌！
Or I'll slap yer chops for yer!

245
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,060
麦布斯
Mabs...

246
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,260
麦布斯 这全是开玩笑的！
Mabs, it's all in jest!

247
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:40,700
他钓到一条鱼 他觉得很稀奇
?He catched a fish upon his heuk He thought leukt varry queer

248
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:46,620
是哪一种鱼儿 年轻的兰普顿不知道
?But what'n a kind of fish it was Young Lambton couldn't tell

249
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:52,340
他不急着带它回家 就把它放在井下
?He wasn't fash to carry it home So he hoyed it doon a well

250
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:58,420
别出声 伙计们 吸口气 让我告诉你一件可怕的事
?Whisht lads, hold yer gobs I'll tell yer all an awful story

251
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:04,660

别出声 伙计们 吸口气 让我告诉你踢走虫子的事
?Whisht lads, hold yer gobs, I'll tell yer boot the worm! ?
 253 00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,460 Fancy a drop of home brew, Chief Inspector?!

252
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,580
是 非常好 谢谢
Yeah, be very nice. Thank you.

253
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:15,380
他就像冈特的家人 是吧
He's like Gunter's family, isn't he?

254
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,300
什么 他说你是冈特一伙的
What was that? He says you're a lot like Gunter.

255
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,340
不是轰炸机飞行员了吧你？哦 不 不是轰炸机飞行员了 不
Weren't a bomber pilot, though, were yer? Oh, no. Not a bomber pilot, no.

256
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,940
不 你要像个轰炸机飞行员样 上点档次！
No, you gotta be posh to be a bomber pilot!

257
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,660
不是那套保守党派的上档次……
Not yer Alec Douglas-Home posh...

258
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,140
但是比你强
But posher than you.

259
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,020
是啊 他会喜欢你的
Aye, he'd have liked you.

260
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,580
你也会喜欢他 好吧 人人都爱老冈特
You'd have liked him, well, everybody liked Gunter.

261
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,900
晚上结束的时候发生什么了？- 他要回德国
End of the evening, what happened? Well, he's back to Deutschland

262
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,420
早潮的时候 所以我们从馆子出来 拥抱他
first tide, so we come out the pub and give him a hug.

263
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:46,060
那是几点？
What time was that?

264
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,860
十点整……我们起得早 你知道的
Ten o'clock sharp... We're up early in the morning, you know.

265
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,740
从哪条路回家的
Which way did you go home?

266
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:55,380
-沿着码头返回山上的 -看见其他人了吗
Along the quayside and back up the hill. See anybody else?

267
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,060
我想没有 不对 有 我们看到了！
Don't think so, no. Yeah, we did!

268
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:01,580
他的儿子 在旅馆附近
That son of his, near his hotel.

269
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,300
因为我说了句“你跟他走岔了”
Cos I said, "Oh, you've missed him!"

270
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,620
我很抱歉 但他不待见咱们
I'm sorry, but he didn't like us.

271
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,420
啊 你也不喜欢他……我们注意到了！
Ah, you didn't like him... We noticed!

272
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,660
谁会喜欢那个自大狂？
Well, what's to like about that arrogant shite?

273
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:16,780
所以你看见他和妻子沿着码头走
So you saw him and his wife walking towards the quayside.

274
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,500
不不 她不在 就他一个人
No, no, she wasn't with him. He was on his own...

275
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,540
难道她不会…… 她胆小
Wouldn't have her down...she's just a mouse.

276
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,820
有什么需要的 尽管叫我
Anything I can do, just give us a shout!

277
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,340
谢谢
Thank you.

278
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,940
-你看到那个在周围晃悠的年轻小伙子了吗 左边那个 -看到了
Did you see the young lad skulking around? The one that left. I did...

279
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,780
说曹操曹操到
Speak of the devil.

280
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,740
昨晚在酒馆
In the pub last night.

281
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,260
酒吧后面有个新来的小伙子叫夏弗斯
There was this new bloke behind the bar called Shavers...

282
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,900
一个大混蛋 你不会去招惹他的
A big bastard, like, yer wouldn't cross him.

283
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,100
不管怎样 我们和冈特在一起
Anyway, we're with Gunter.

284
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,900
在酒吧的我一哥们说夏弗斯语不惊人死不休纳粹那些事
A mate of mine at the bar says Shavers has been mouthing off

285
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:04,340
在冈特的啤酒里小便 还放言道要做得更甚 知道吗
about the Nazis an' that, an' how he pissed in Gunter's beer and said he had a mind to do more, you know?

286
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:12,540
当一些人走出来抗议 他的走狗就跟着他
And when a few others walked out in protest, he gans with 'em.

287
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:16,980
-别出声 伙计们 吸口气 让我告诉你一件可怕的事 -这是几点的事
?Whisht lads, hold yer gobs I'll tell yer all an awful story... ?
What time was this?

288
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,700
刚过九点？
Just after nine?

289
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,180
好吧 谢了…… 保持联系
Right, thanks... We'll be in touch.

290
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,460
在我们要走的时候我又看见他了
I saw him again that night when we were leaving.

291
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,500
在停车场
In the car park,

292
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,820
背阴的地方 观察咱们……我感觉不妙 就像 但……
in the shadows, watching us... I didn't have a good feeling, like, but...

293
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,860
和冈特道别后再回头看 他就不见了
say goodbye to Gunter and look back, and he'd gone.

294
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,580
是夏弗斯？
This is Shavers?

295
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,140
是啊
Aye.

296
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,020
奇克・夏弗斯 你看见他往哪走了吗
Chick Shavers. Did you see where he went?

297
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,300
没 我们只是开走了
Nah, we just drove off.

298
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,300
之后看见什么人没？
And did you see anyone after that?

299
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,580
只有鞋子上的狗屎
Only Dog Shite On Yer Shoe.

300
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,260
你知道 冈特的儿子 从山上下来
Y'know, Gunter's son. Coming down the hill.

301
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,900
谢谢
Thank you.

302
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,380
谢了
Thanks.

303
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,820
嘿！
Hoy!

304
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,420
你知道开车的小诀窍吗
Y'know that owld knack ya drivin'?

305
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,980
25镑买废品？
Will you take 25 pound for scrap?

306
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,220
不 我不愿意
No. I won't.

307
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:16,060
你再碰我试试！进来
Touch me one more time! Get in.

308
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,740
夏弗斯先生 感谢您前来 请坐
Mr Shavers, thanks for coming in. Please sit down.

309
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,340
不 谢了 我不会停下来的
No, ta, I won't be stopping.

310
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:30,340
有人举报声称你曾在一位特别顾客的啤酒里排便
e've had reports that you claimed to have urinated in the beer of a particular customer last night...

311
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:36,300
在克劳特 是啊 我干了三次呢 一个帝国一次！
In the Kraut's, aye. I did it three times, one for each Reich!

312
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,340
你清楚史迈克先生今早被发现死亡了吧
You're aware Mr Schmeikel was found dead this morning.

313
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,420
呃 如果死因是尿液中毒 你们抓到人了
Well, if it's from urine poisoning, I'm yer man.

314
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,620
他死没死你毫不关心？看
You don't mind that he's dead? Look.

315
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,500
我不知道战争期间你做了什么 坐下 向民众大放厥词 释放隔阂的烟幕……
I don't know what you were doing in the war. Sit down. Yelling at folk to put up black-out curtains...

316
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:54,620
我是把那些渣滓从哪来的踢回哪去 还有我亲眼所见 有事长埋于此 于此！
I was kicking that scum back where they came from, and I saw things that are buried into here! Here!

317
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,660
你和你们世界的其他人可以原谅忘记 但不包括我
You and the rest of the world can forgive and forget... But not me.

318
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,420
淡定 我们手上有你了
Calm down. I've had it with you!!

319
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,620
我不介意
I'm all right.

320
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:16,260
我想念我的使命了
I missed my vocation.

321
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,460
怀疑脊柱断了
Suspected broken back.

322
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,260
其它和我们估计的一样
Everything else just as we thought.

323
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,220
-泰勒 -在
-Taylor. -Sir.

324
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,700
他们告诉我你喜欢摔跤
They tell me you're a wrestling fan. 

325
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,780
哦，我妈喜欢，我只是为了带她去罢了
Oh, well, me mam is sir, I just take her along, like.

326
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,620
切克・谢弗斯听说过吗？
Name Chick Shavers mean anything to you?

327
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,380
对，我在波维克见过他一次…
Oh, aye, I saw him in Berwick once...

328
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,300
他现在退休了，膝盖不行了。他是块难啃的骨头
He's retired now, did his knee in. Oh, he was a nasty piece of work.

329
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,820
不过干得非常不赖
Played the part well, though. 

330
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:42,060
把波罗洲那个野人打得很惨
Did some horrible things to The Wild Man of Borneo.

331
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,380
有一次几乎把他的背打断了
Nearly broke his back once.

332
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,900
-谢谢你 -是
-Thank you. -Sir. 

333
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:53,660
如果我们把他拷起来，你觉得你能自己对付谢弗斯吗？
So if we cuff him, d'you reckon you can manage Shavers on your own?

334
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,780
-当然能 -好的
Yeah, of course. Good.

335
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,660
不过我应该…
Well, I should, um...

336
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,700
站在他够不着的地方
stay out of his reach though. 

337
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:07,540
我反对纳粹来这里到处挥舞他们的钞票！
I object to Nazis coming here and flashing their money around.

338
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,220
我反对。因为――我的钱在哪里？嗯？
I object, OK? Cos where's my money, eh? 

339
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,500
我的呢？我以为我们是战胜国！
Where's mine? I thought we won the war!

340
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,500
现在是1964年了，谢弗斯先生
This is 1964, Mr Shavers.

341 

00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,620
你倒是腰包鼓鼓的！
There speaks a man whose pockets are full!

342
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,580
听着
Listen...

343
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:26,500
我不主动去找他们，可如果他们在我门口出现，还在我面前挥舞钞票，
I don't go looking for them, right? But if they turn up on my doorstep and wave it in my face then yeah,

344
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:31,540
我就会在他们的啤酒里撒尿，老乡们会鼓励地拍咱的背！
I'll put piss in their beer, and folk'll pat us on the back for doing it!

345
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,540
-你还干了什么了？ -你什么意思，还？
-What else did you do? -What d'you mean, what else?

346
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:38,180
我们有目击证人说在冈特・施麦克离开酒馆时你在停车场
We have a witness that places you in the car park when Gunter Schmeikel left the pub.

347
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:41,740
证人？你不是说那个弱智吧？
Witness. Don't yer mean half-wit?

348
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,020
哈迪曼家的？
One of the Hardyments?

349
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,460
说他弱智还差不多！
Witless, more like!

350
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:51,100
-谢弗斯先生，你有没有跟踪施麦克回到码头？ -没
-Mr Shavers, did you follow Gunter Schmeikel down to the quay? -No.

351
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,020
因为他的背被打断了
Because his back was broken, see. 

352
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,580
你很有本事做到这个，不是吗？
You're quite capable of doing that, aren't you?

353
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,020
不，不，不 你不能！
No. No, no, no, no. No, you don't! 

354
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,580
哇哦！
Whoa!

355 

00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,780
听着…
Look...

356
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,020
冷静一下
Just calm down, all right.

357
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,700
我们接着来
Just get on with it.

358
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,580
好了
All right.

359
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,340
我的确去了码头，没错
I did go to the quayside, aye.

360
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,700
不过是正要回来，这是实话
But I was on me way back, and this is the truth, right?

361
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,900
因为我承认我恨他们
Cos I admit it. I hate 'em.

362
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:26,900
我恨德国鬼子，不错，我确实想干点什么，我知道能干什么
I hate Jerries, and all right, I did want to do somet hing else and I knew what that something was, so I

363
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,980
所以我去了码头，准备松开他们的小船
went down to the quay to set their boat adrift.

364
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,460
这时大概9点
This is about nine. 

365
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:38,340
我到他们那条豪华小船的时候周围没有人
And I arrive, and there's their flash boat with no-one around, or, I think

366
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:45,460
或者我觉得没有人，然后我发现了一辆轿车，里面的人打开了灯，所以我转过了身
there's no-one around, but then I clock this car, cos whoever's in it turns on some light so I turn away.

367
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,380
等等，等等
Hang about, hang about.

368
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,020
-那是谁？ -我不知道
-Who was it? -I don't know.

369 

00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,020
那你……你没认出他们？
Well, didn't...didn't you recognise them?

370
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,780
我又没在看！我是在等着把他们的船松开
I'm not looking, am I? I'm waiting to set the boat adrift.

371
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:58,860
我只希望那个家伙走人，可他没走，就坐在那里！
I just want the bloke to go, but he stays, he just sits there!

372
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,620
冷静
Calm down.

373
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:08,060
等了半小时以后，我没兴趣了，放弃了回到酒馆
And after half an hour of waiting, I lose me appetite, give up, go back to the pub and

374
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:13,460
我到那里时哈迪曼家和德国佬正在往家走。这都是大实话
arrive just as the Hardyments and the Kraut are heading off home. And that's the God's honest.

375
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,980
-那车是什么样的？ -我不知道！
-And what type of car was it? -I don't know! 

376
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,540
一辆深色的沙龙
A da rk saloon.

377
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:24,140
我不能肯定，我只能告诉你这么多
I can't be sure. That's all I can tell you.

378
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,660
好的
Right. 

379
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:38,860
我说切克・谢弗斯不是你的真名，对不对？
Would I be right in thinking that "Chick Shavers" isn't your real name?

380
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:42,580
这是我的艺名，现在大家都叫我这个名字
Well, it's the name I used professionally. And i t's the one I'm known as now.

381
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:45,420
好吧
Right, yeah, see,

382
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,260
恐怕我们需要你出生证上的名字
I'm afraid we need your name that's on your birth certificate.

383
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,740
-马尔科姆・费雷 -什么？
-Malcolm Fairey. -Sorry?

384
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,300
马尔科姆・费雷
Malcolm Fairey!

385
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,060
-谢谢 -娘娘腔
-Thank you. -Poofter.

386
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,620
你知道，没有一个当地人…
You know, none of the locals...

387
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,580
当然，除了蓝色角落里的那个“仙女”
Well, except for the Fairey in the blue corn er...

388
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,620
没有任何人说过我们这位德国轰炸机飞行员的坏话
none of them have a bad word to say about our Germ an bomber.

389
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:14,820
是啊，冈特・施麦克似乎是个挺正派的人
Yeah, Gunter Schmeikel seems to have been a decent fellow.

390
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:18,420
是啊，是啊，作为一个往人头上扔炸弹的人来说
Oh, yeah, yeah. For somebody who dropped bombs on people.

391
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,860
你知道 我还记得那些被轰炸的码头
You know, I can just about remember the docks being bombed.

392
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,500
平民被炸死
Civilians were killed.

393
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,060
无辜的群众
Innocent people. 

394
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,940
听说过德累斯顿吗
Ever hear of Dresden?

395
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:32,220
我们的轰炸机在那里制造的火风暴杀了5万百姓
Our bombs created a fire storm that killed 50,000 civilians.

396
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,260
据我所知没什么特别的原因
For no particular reason that I can think of,

397
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,660
只为了恐吓一个民族
except to terrorise a nation.

398
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:44,260
德国人在发动该死的战争之前就该想到这一点
Yeah, well, the Germans should've thought of that before they started the bloody war.

399
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,140
对
Right.

400
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:52,740
切克・谢弗斯告诉我们在他离开时码头有辆车
Chick Shavers tells us that there was a car at the quayside when he left.

401
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:57,140
-对 -等他回到酒馆时，哈迪曼一家正在对冈特说再见，
-Yep. -When he got to the pub, the Hardyments were saying goodbye to Gunter,

402
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:02,780
然后哈迪曼家开车走了，在山上他们看到威尔海姆下来
and the Hardyments drive along the road, up the hill where they see Wilhelm coming down.

403
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,900
对，他是一个人，没带他的妻子
Yeah, and he's on his own. He hasn't got his wife with him.

404
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,780
-根据哈迪曼家的说法 -对
According to the Hardyments. Yeah. 

405
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:10,460
同时，冈特从酒馆走去了码头
Meanwhile, Gunter's walking from the pub to the quay.

406
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:13,260
我们推测，他就是在那里遇到了杀他的人
We assume, where he met his maker.

407
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:17,260
我们去看看施麦克他们什么时候回酒店的
Let's see what time the Schmeikels booked back into their hotel.

408
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,020
-好 -应该很有意思
-OK. -Should be interesting.

409
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,620
-查尔纳？ -你说了“不管醉的还是醒的”，头儿
-China? -Well, you did say "drunk or sober", Guv.

410
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:33,100
不，不，巴克斯先生。我清醒得像只羊，准备并愿意
No, no, Mr Bacchus. I'm sober as a lamb, and ready and willing to

411
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:39,700
去做任何詹特利先生准备并愿意让我去做的事
do whatever it is Mr Gently is ready and willing for me to do.

412
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,220
看来是醉的
Drunk, then.

413
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,780
-泰勒 -长官
-Taylor. -Sir.

414
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:50,220
去我家，把这个人擦洗干净，刮好胡子，给他穿上我的西装和衬衫，戴上领带
Go to my house. I want this man scrubbed, shaved and put in one of my suits, with a shirt and tie,

415
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,820
穿好鞋和袜子…我的袜子…然后再带回来
with shoes on, and socks...my socks...and brought back here.

416
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:58,060
詹特利先生，先生，我不能让其他男的靠近我…
Mr Gently, sir. I cannot let another man perform intimate...

417
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:01,900
如果我乐意…
And if I'm pleased...

418
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,860
擦洗，泰勒・・・从头到脚
Scoured, Taylor...head to toe.

419
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,620
-越快越好 -是，长官
-Quick as you can. -Yes, sir.

420
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,740
他名叫罗伯特・斯特拉顿
His name's Robert Stratton.

421
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,860
他是国家公园的看守人
He's a warden for the National Park. 

422
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:15,180
他昨天晚上在码头上，观察鸟类迁徙
He was on the quay last night monitoring bird migration.

423
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,740
我只是复述，先生
I only know what I'm told, sir.

424
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,300
他是自己来的
He came in of his own accord.

425
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:25,540
他带着他女儿一起来的，那就是她。他妻子身体不好
He's here with his daughter, that's her, cos his wife's not well,

426
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:30,100
他女儿明显有些…
and his daughter's apparently a bit... WHISTLES

427
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,700
我们大概9点去了码头
We got to the quay around nine. 

428
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,500
-对不起，夜里看鸟？ -对
-Yes... -Bird watching at night? Yeah.

429
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,780
我们不是整年都看，只是在迁徙开始的时候才看
Oh, we don't do it all year round, just when the migrations are on.

430
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,500
你不必非得看见它们，知道么
You don't have to see them, y'see...

431
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,500
能听见它们飞来了
you can hear 'em coming in.

432
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:47,020
有一个湖上出现了一对秋沙鸭，从丹麦飞来的
And we've had a couple of mergansers turn up on one of the lakes, from Denmark.

433
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:51,340
红色的秋沙鸭是很邋遢的鸟儿，在这些地方不常见
The red merganser's a scruffy bird, it's not very common in these parts.

434
00:27:51,340 --> 00:28:00,220
它的脑袋很多毛，看起来乱糟糟的，总好像湿淋淋的…总是…总是…
It's got a tufty head, very untidy-looking, always bedraggled...always...always.

435
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,780
就是它
That's the one. 

436
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:07,300
但是你昨天晚上没出去，只是坐在码头旁边的车里？
But you weren't out and about last night, you were sitting in your car on the quay?

437
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:12,900
我选了个角度可以看到海，我没看到有人来肯定是因为我正在看海
Angled, yeah, so I'm looking out to sea, which is what I must've been doing cos I didn't see anyone arrive.

438
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,580
可突然这个大块头从停小船的地方冒了出来
But suddenly this big chap turns up, down by the dinghy moorings.

439
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:20,060
他向我这个方向看了看，就转开了
He looks in my direction and turns away.

440
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:23,300
他来回走了一阵子，好像很不耐烦
And he walks up and down a bit, impatient, like.

441
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,900
后来我继续去观察天空，他走了
And then I'm checking the skies again and he's gone.

442
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:31,140
-后来怎么了？ -有些麻鹬和蛎鹬来了
-And what happened then? -Well, some curlew and oyster-catchers come over.

443
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,180
我们对鸟不是很感兴趣
We're not greatly interested in the birds.

444
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:38,320
哦，对不起……对
Oh, I'm sorry... No, um...

445
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,120
10点10分
Ten past ten, 

446
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,900
又来了一个伙计
another chap turns up.

447
00:28:41,902 --> 00:28:43,740
这个瘦一些，非常高…
A slighter man, quite tall...

448
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:48,900
恐怕我做不出更详细的描述，不过他坐在一根
I can't give much of a description, I'm afraid, but he's sitting on one of the

449
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,880 
系船柱上，敲着大腿，好像在敲着一首歌的鼓点
bollards and he's tapping his thighs, you know, like he's drumming along to a song.

450
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:57,960
然后…就像我说过的，我决定今天晚上不干了，回家了
And... Well, as I say, I'd decided to call it a day and I drive off.

451
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,980
就是这个男的死了吗？
Was this the man who died?

452
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,260
等一下…
One minute...

453
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,160
我能去拿一下护照吗
Can I go and get the passports?

454
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,700
爱丽丝！爱丽丝！不，别动这个
Alice! Alice. No. Stop it.

455
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,460
对不起
I'm sorry.

456
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,940
给你，给你……
Here y'are, here y'are...

457
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:18,720
把你这个月看到的鸟列个单子
Make a list of every bird you've seen this month. 

458
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,900
你能及时来真是太好了
It's very good of you to have come in so promptly.

459
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:29,100
你在码头上看到的就是这个人吗
Was this the man that you saw at the quay?

460
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,080
我的距离有点远
Look, I was some way away.

461
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,260
我不能肯定 嗯
I cannot swear to it. Right.

462
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,780
这两个人呢
What about these two?

463
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,660
他们在酒店
Yeah, they were at the hotel.

464
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,880
好的
Right. 

465
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,480
我下山的时候进去喝了杯酒
I popped in for a drink on the way down.

466
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:47,760
他们就在酒吧里，很显眼  我回家的时候和这个人擦肩而过，他正在向码头方向走
They were at the bar, very smart. I passed this one as I was going home, he was coming down towards the quay.

467
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,060
他和什么人在一起吗？
Was he with anybody?

468
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,960
不，是一个人，拎着两个袋子
No, he was on his own, he was carrying two bags.

469
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,020
对不起，她……给你  爱丽丝，松手
Oh, I'm sorry, she's... Here y'are. Alice, leave it.

470
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,100
给你 接着写
There you go. Go on, carry on.

471
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,300
没事，没事
All right, all right...

472
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,220
我只想问你们几个问题，行吧
All I wanna do is ask you a few questions, that's all, right?

473
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:10,740
我只见过他两次，不过冈特就像是你认识了很多年的那种人
I only meet him twice, but Gunter, he is like someone you have known for years.

474
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,580
他很…
He is so...

475
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,980
你说话的时候他会看着你
He looks at you when you speak,

476
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,680
认真看着你
looks into you.

477
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,100
对你感兴趣
Is interested in you, 

478
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,620
那样的笑容
and has such a smile. 

479
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,060
我觉得…
I think...

480
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:30,140

SHE SPEAKS ITALIAN Ma non tutti, ovviamente.

481
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:34,420

Parla Italiano? No, veramente, no.

482
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,760

Mia moglie e nata a Napoli.

483
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,060
哦……他结婚了
Oh...he's married, 

484
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,460
多可惜呀！
what a pity!

485
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,540
冈特曾经跟我说过一次意大利语
Gunter, he spoke Italian to me once,

486
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:49,000
虽然他过去的妻子是……丹麦人
though his wife was, um...  Danish.

487
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,080
-过去？ -他告诉我她今年死了
-WAS Danish? -She died this year, he say to me.

488
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,080
-我妻子也是 -我真抱歉
-So did mine. -I'm so sorry.

489
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,180
冈特昨天晚上走的时候…
When Gunter left last night...

490
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,880
-和哈迪曼一家一起走的 -是，还有别人走吗
With the Hardyments. Yes, did anyone else leave?

491
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,540
那些不喜欢德国人请喝啤酒的人
The ones that don't like a German buying the drinks

492
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:10,280
先是出去了，后来又从另一扇门进来了
and have walked out, they come back in through the other door.

493
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:14,360
我在酒吧里又忙了半个多小时，我一个人
I have been working the bar for half an hour or more, on my own.

494
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:18,720
喝酒免费，切克也回来帮忙了
And the drinks are free, but now Chick is back to help!

495
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,740
切克・谢弗斯什么时候回来的
And Chick Shavers came back when? 

496
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:25,960
冈特和哈迪曼一走，切克就回来了
Gunter and the Hardyments go, and Chick is next to me straightaway.

497

00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,180
-然后留在这里了 -对。
-And stays here? -Yes.

498
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,560
如果你想到
If you think

499
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,020
任何事要问我
of anything else you would like to ask me...

500
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,140
谢谢
Thank you. 

501
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,000
给警察局打电话，他们可以放切克・谢弗斯走了
Call the station. They can let Chick Shavers go.

502
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,700
他有不在场证明
Got an alibi. 

503
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,840
詹特利先生，先生
Mr Gently, sir.

504
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,680
我们干的怎么样？我还行吧
How have we done? Will I do?

505
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,280
你有梳子吗，警长
Have you got a comb, Sergeant?

506
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,780
给他
Give it to him.

507
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,140
你发现什么了
What did you find out?

508
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,800
里面有个人说向哈迪曼家打听一个叫茉莉的女人
Bloke in there says ask the Hardyments about a woman called Molly,

509
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,140
她在战争期间和他们住在一起
lived with them during the war.

510
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,360
和冈特有点关系
And then had a thing with Gunter,

511
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,480
后来自杀了
and then she later topped herself. 

512
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,320
查尔纳！跟我走
China! Come with me. 

513
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,700
不，你
No, you... 

514
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,440
查尔纳，那是我的西装，别把烟头掉在上面
China, that's my suit. Don't put fag-ends in it.

515
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:44,560
-好的，詹特利先生 -如果我把你假扮成一位警官，你起码得装装样子
-Right, Mr Gently. -If I'm passing you off as a police officer, at least try and act like one.

516
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,940
我有个问题
I have a problem. 

517
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,060
哈迪曼家的人记得开车超过了你，施麦克先生 只有你一个人
The Hardyments only remember driving past you, Mr Schmeikel. You alone,

518
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,200
没有施麦克夫人
not Mrs Schmeikel.

519
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,540
她是和我在一起
She was with me!

520
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,080
我在……我和他在一起
I was there... I was with him.

521
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:15,980
另一个证人只见到施麦克先生下山
Another witness only saw Mr Schmeikel walking down the hill.

522
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,260
他们撒谎
They are lying! 

523
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,580
他们为什么撒谎
Why would they do that?

524
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,220
现在是谁在做调查
Who is the investigator here?

525
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:28,500
也许哈迪曼家想指责我，因为他们指责过我了
Perhaps the Hardyments wish to point the finger at me because they did it.

526
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,300
对不起，你是在指责哈迪曼家吗？
Um, I'm sorry, are you accusing the Hardyments?

527
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,240
对！为什么不
Yeah! Why not?

528
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,120
他们喝醉了，他们杀了他！
They get drunk and they kill him!

529
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,100
-威尔海姆，别  -因为什么原因杀他，施麦克先生
Wilhelm, nein. -Kill him for what reason, Mr Schmeikel?

530
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,320
因为他是德国人
For being German,

531
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:49,140
而且很成功，你们无法忍受因为我们比你们更坚定
and successful, a combination you cannot bear because we are more determined than you,

532
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,640
更勤奋，更有独创性，这让你们生气
more industrious, more ingenious, and this makes you angry.

533
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,620
哦，不可能，对不起，我忘了
Oh. Not possible. I'm sorry, I forgot. 

534
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:04,980
你们英国人是这么开心
You British are so pleasant. SHE SPEAKS GERMAN

535
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,160

HE REPLIES IN GERMAN

536
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,500
随他们去
Leave 'em to it.

537
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,700
我替我丈夫道歉
I apologise for my husband. 

538
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,520
他很生气
He is upset.

539
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:21,220
不过我很好奇，你觉得哈迪曼家是出于什么
I'm curious, though, as to what motive you think

540
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:26,940
动机把这件事归咎于你，如果他们认为是你杀了你父亲？
the Hardyments would attribute to you, if they thought you had killed your father.

541
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,660
-这个问题太扯了！ -威尔海姆
-Ridiculous question. -Wilhelm.

542
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,380
你们是不是认为我们现在是嫌疑犯
Are you considering us now suspects? 

543
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:40,100

Britische Gerechtigkeit!

544
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:44,420

THEY SPEAK ANGRILY IN GERMAN

545
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,120
你都听到了？ 
Did you get all that? 

546
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,880
她叫他别粗鲁…
She asked him not be rude...

547
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:04,100
然后他就爆粗了……他还告诉她
And then he was rude, and he told her to

548
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,120
从现在起别管了
leave it to him from now on. 

549
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,980
他们吵了一架
They were having a row.

550
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,360
-我看是 -在那之前呢？
-I think. -And before that?

551
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:16,540
她说哈迪曼家为什么要在他给了他们那么大一个好处的时候杀了他？
She was saying why would the Hardyments kill Gunter when he was making them such a generous offer?

552
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,180
-什么好处？ -什么好处？-我怎么知道？
-What offer? -What offer? -How do I know?

553
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,440
他叫她闭嘴，再也别提这事
He told her to shut up and never mention it again.

554
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,560
干得好，查尔纳
Well done, China.

555
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,220
谢谢，詹特利先生
Thanks, Mr Gently.

556
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,700
-也许还会需要你 -对，
-May be needing you again. -Yeah.

557
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,200
"Niemals" 意思是“永不”
"Niemals", it means never.

558
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,680
查尔纳没能离开敦刻尔克海滩
China never got off the beach at Dunkirk.

559
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,300
他在德国战俘营里呆了5年
He spent five years in various Stalags.

560
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,900

DOGS BARK AND GEESE QUACK

561
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,040
把凳子拖出来
Pull up the crates.

562
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,880
你们也许觉得之前已经吃过这个了 不过，给你们上一课
Now, yer might think this is what yer had before...but there's a lesson in that.

563
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:05,080
拉长你们两次来访的时间
Put days between yer visits.

564
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,580
我不要 谢谢
None for me... Thank you very much.

565
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,020
好了 坐吧 坐吧
Oh, yeah, man. Tuck in, tuck in.

566
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,500
你们带来什么消息了吗？
Are yer back with news?

567
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,960
只有更多的问题
Just some questions.

568
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,880
好吧 我们喜欢来点儿智力测验 开始吧
Aye, well, we like a bit of a quiz. So fire away. 

569
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,780 
茉莉是谁？
Who's Molly?

570
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,600
谁跟你们说茉莉的？
Who talked to you about Molly?

571
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,200
为什么不跟我们说说她？
Why don't you just tell us about her?

572 
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,500
吉米，坐下 吉米 吉米！
Jimmy. Sit down. Jimmy... Jimmy! 

573
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,600
茉莉是吉米的妈妈
Molly was Jimmy's mum.

574
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,680
她是附近一个农场主的女儿
She was the daughter of a neighbouring farmer,

575
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:51,340
当她怀了私生子时――那是1940年1月
and when she got pregnant, out of wedlock, this is January 1940,

576
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,160
她父亲把她赶了出去 王八蛋
the father kicked her out. The bastard.

577
00:36:54,360 --> 00:37:00,040
茉莉一直在学习当老师，挺有前途的，所以我和玛布丝收留了她
Molly was training to be a teacher, you know, something worthwhile, so Mabs and me, we took her in.

578
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:04,160
吉米出生后，玛布丝照料他，好让她完成学业
And when Jimmy was born, Mabs looked after him, so she could finish her training.

579
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:08,820
她后来成了个出色的老师，人家告诉我们
And she became a wonderful teacher, so we're told.

580
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:16,400
后来战争结束了，两年以后的47年5月2日，谁也没想到
Then the war ended and two year after, '47, 2nd of May, nay-body saw it coming.

581
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,000
她自杀了
She took her own life.

582
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,580
就在这个农场里
Here on the farm.

583
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,520
就是冈特住的那个阁楼
Up in the loft where Gunter stayed. 

584
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,580
没有原因
No reason why.

585
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,660
没有遗言
No last note. 

586
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,280
只有个空药瓶
Just an empty bottle of pills.

587
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,520
-冈特当时在哪里？ -被遣返了，两周前才回去
-Where was Gunter? Repatriated. -He'd gone back two weeks before.

588
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:38,200
她是怎么死的，死在哪里，又是为什么    大家都在谈，胡乱猜疑
Aye, the how she died, and the where and the why got everybody talking, you know, making assumptions.

589
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,300
茉莉和冈特之间发生了什么吗？
Did anything happen between Molly and Gunter?

590
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,220
能回答这个问题的两个人都死了，不过…
Well, now, the only two people who can answer that are dead, but...

591
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:47,150
我敢肯定他们之间肯定什么事也没有
I'm sure as damn-it certain nowt happened between 'em.

592
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,440
那么吉米呢？
What about Jimmy, then?

593
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,520
那时候他应该已经7岁了吧，茉莉死的时候？
He must have been about, I dunno, seven when Molly died.

594
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:56,400
也许他看到他们……看到他们在一起，也许他知道什么事儿
Maybe he saw 'em... You know, saw them together, maybe he knows something.

595
00:37:56,950 --> 00:38:01,860
等冈特再回来的时候，对，大家又开始谈论了，说这和他有什么关系？
Look, when Gunter comes back again, aye, everybody's talking again, you know, was it to do with him?

596
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:07,100
可他在这里的时间不长，只是在农场看了一圈 我们都跟在他后面
But he hadn't been here long, looking round the farm. We're all traipsing after him.

597
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:11,680
一切都没变
Nothing has changed.

598
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,380
什么都没变
Nothing.

599
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:17,820
全和从前一样 一切！
All is as it was. Everything!

600
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:22,040
只有我们 我们变了！
Only us...we have changed!

601
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,100
看看你们大伙
Look at you all!

602
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:26,600
吉米
Jimmy...

603
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,500
你才这么大
You were that size!

604
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,540
还有你妈妈，茉莉
And your mother, Molly.

605
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,400
她现在在哪里
What is she now?

606
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,200
她是校长了？一定是个好老师
She's a head teacher? Must be such a fine teacher.

607
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,380
我也能见到她吗
Will I get to see her, too?

608
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,220
不能，嗯
No, um...

609
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:49,380
妈妈很久之前就不在了，冈特
We lost Mum a long time ago, Gunter.

610
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,920
那么多双眼睛盯着他看
'He had all these pairs of eyes staring at him,

611
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,840
寻找内疚的痕迹，哪怕是一丝的良心发现
'looking for a hint of guilt, a trace of bad conscience,

612
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,900
可我们看到的只有爱和悲伤
'and all we saw was love and sadness.'

613
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,020
和我们所有人的感觉一样
Same as what we all felt.

614
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:05,500
后来他在她自杀的那个阁楼里住了两个晚上
And yet, he spent two nights in the loft where she killed herself.

615
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:09,400
-可我们没告诉他她死在哪里 -我能看看吗
-Yeah, but we didn't tell him that's where it happened. -Mind if I have a look?

616
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,520
没什么可看的
There's not much to see, like.

617
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:23,500
到了
There you go. 

618
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:34,300
像我说的，没什么可看的
Like I said, not much to see.

619
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,860
先生
Sir...

620
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,020
那是冈特的  一定是他落在这里的
That's Gunter's. He must've left it here.

621
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:01,800
-他去酒馆没带？ -应该没有 肯定是他放这儿了
-He didn't take it to the pub? -Can't have. He must've left it here.

622
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,800
-指纹 -指纹？你要指纹做什么？
-Fingerprints. -Fingerprints! What do you want fingerprints for?

623
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:10,200
冈特在这里的时候有没有说要给你们什么好处？
Did Gunter make you any kind of offer while he was here?

624
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,100
谁告诉你的？
Who told you that? 

625
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,260
-有没有 -这个，我不是很明白他的意思
-Did he? -Well, I didn't really understand what he was on about.

626
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,240
说什么给免费给我们他公司的股票
Something to do with him giving us shares in his firm for free.

627
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,370
可我不喜欢股票的说法，所以拒绝了
But I didn't like the sound of shares, so I said no.

628
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:27,240
可他不断地提起，说要感谢我为他所做的一切
But he kept bringing it up, saying he wanted to thank me for what I did for him.

629
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,800
我对他说口头感谢就足够了
And I said to him words are enough.

630
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,440
你为他做了什么？
What did you do for him?

631
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:38,640
照我看没什么，可他说是我们中的一份子
Nowt, as far as I was concerned, but he said it was the community.

632
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:40,660
我们生活的方式
The way we lived.

633
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,740
你不像之前那么友好了

哦 长官 尸检报告
Oh, sir, post mortem.

665
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:05,440
下面的脊柱因为压力而粉碎了 不是因为击打
The lower spine has splintered from pressure, not a blow.

666
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:10,260
对此他们还会做进一步检查 小伙子们还在取钱包上的指纹
They're gonna do more tests on that. The fingerprint boys are still working on the wallet. Too slow!

667
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,700
我已经训斥过他们了 长官 你听听这个
I have bollocked them, sir, but listen to this.

为什么他要偷他父亲的钱呢
Why would he need to steal from his father?

671
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:30,300
因为甘特正打算将他的公司转为合作机构
Because Gunter was in the process of turning his company into a co-operative,

672
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,820
让每个员工都成为股票持有人

闭嘴
Shut up.

686
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,660
费恶瑞先生
Mr Fairey.

687
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:34,940
- 是谁负责管辖这块的 - 不是我 长官
- Who's been doing all the talking round here? - Not me, sir.

但你没打电话给我们 不是吗
Didn't telephone us, though, did you?

754
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:04,580
好了 现在你可以走了 谢谢 听着...
All right, you can go now. Thank you. Listen...

755
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:06,740
不 不 不 去车里
No, no, no. In the car.

756
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:11,380
拜托 拜托听我讲 这对我来说很重要对你来说也一样重要 拜托你能听我讲
Please. Just, please listen. This could be as important for you as it is for me. Please listen.

757
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:16,220
- 现在你听我说 你不知道自己卷入了什么麻烦中吧 对吧 - 不 我当然知道 我知道
- No, you listen. You don't know how much trouble you're in? Right. - No, I know, I know.

758
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:19,540
我知道 在这儿你们会把人吊死
I know, you hang people here.

759
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:24,920
如果浪头扑向我 显然现在已经扑向了 那么没有人是会理解的
And if the tide is against me, which it is, then no-one is going to understand.

760
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:29,640
现在我父亲的公司是我的了
So my father's company, mine now,

761
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,120
我们可以以我们的方式来结算
we can pay our way!

762
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:39,620
- 我没听懂 - 哦 不 你懂得 你很聪明 并且...
- I'm not following you. - Oh, yes, you are. You are very smart, and...

763
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,120
并且我一直都有关注你
and I've been watching you.

764
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:44,740
你有关系在警局 我并没有试图想要逃避什么
You have connections. And I'm not trying to avoid anything.

765
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:48,140
只是 在德国 我们没有死刑
It is just that, in Germany, we do not have the death penalty.

766
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:53,560
所以我所请求的就是你能够帮助我引渡 能把我送还到不来梅港市
So all I ask is for you to work on my extradition, to have me sent back to Bremen.

767
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,620
如果你能帮我 我会给你20000英镑
For that, I will give you L20,000.

768
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:03,520
因为我没有杀害我的父亲 没有 我没有
Because I did not kill my father! Did not, did not!

769
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:07,260
听着...
Look...

770
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:10,400
为表示我的真心 只要一个电话...
To show good faith, with one phone call...

771
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:15,040
今天你的账号里就能多5000英镑
I put 拢5,000 into your bank account today.

772
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:20,680
现在 我唯一需要的就是你的卡号 好吗
Now. All I need is you give me your account number. Yes?

773
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:34,420
长官
Sir?

774
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,280
- 斯科美克有什么消息吗 - 额 还没有 长官
- Schmiekel, any news? - Er, no, sir.

775
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:41,320
- 验尸报告呢 - 也还没完成 长官
- Post-mortem tests? - No. Not yet, sir.

776
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:45,740
我刚刚被告知甘特斯科美克的钱包上检测到两个人的指纹
I've just been told there are two sets of prints on Gunter Schmeikel's wallet.

777
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,260
甘特和吉米哈德蒙特的
Gunter's and Jimmy Hardyment's.

778
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:55,020
吉米...你能告诉我
Jimmy... Could you tell me, please,

779
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:58,500
为什么甘特的钱包上有你的指纹吗
why your finger-prints were on Gunter's wallet?

780
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,420
我拿它看一下里面有没有我妈妈的照片
I took it to see if he had a photo of me mam in it.

781
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:06,520
什么时候的事
When was this?

782
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,980
昨晚在酒吧的时候
In the pub on the last night.

783
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:15,380
他唱着歌然后把外套扔给了我们
'He was singing this song and just threw his jacket to us.

784
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,620
他唱完时 我还拿着那个钱包
'But when he finished, I was still holding the wallet.'

785
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,280
还没来得及看里面
Hadn't looked in it yet.

786
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,840
防止有人看到...
In case anybody saw us...

787
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:28,640
因为我觉得自己像个小偷
Cos I felt like a thief.

788
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:31,060
所以我便把它收在身上
So then I kept it.

789
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:36,740
我把钱包放在阁楼的床头柜上 不过他似乎忘拿了
I put it in the bedside cupboard up in the loft as if he'd forgotten it.

790
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,660
那里面有你母亲的照片吗
And was there a photo of your mum in it?

791
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:47,040
吉米 你认为甘特需要对你母亲的死负责吗
Jimmy, do you think Gunter was responsible for your mother's death?

792
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:59,480
我知道威尔海姆和甘特的关系不好
I don't pretend that Wilhelm's relationship with Gunter was easy.

793
00:53:59,780 --> 00:53:01,320
一直这样
It wasn't.

794
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:04,620
我想他们可能对一切事情的观点都不相同
I think, maybe, they disagree about everything,

795
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:09,560
但是有一位成功的父亲 儿子是很难做的
but to be the son of a successful father, it is hard.

796
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,460
然后这次旅行中 他被引荐给这些...
Then on this trip to be presented to these...

797
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,400
威尔海姆称他们为农夫...他们的确是
Wilhelm calls them peasants... and they are.

798
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,460
从最好的层面来说 他们是农夫
In the best sense, they are.

799
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:23,860
但是后来他父亲说 我们也应该成为这样的人
But then his father is saying, these people are what we must be like.

800
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:28,780
我们的公司应该成为这样 我们应该这样互相照顾
This is what our company must be like, this is how we must look after one another,

801
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,380
真的 这不关商业
and really, this is not business!

802
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:36,180
你在哪里见到哈德蒙特的
And you met the Hardyments where?

803
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,300
威尔海姆的父亲研究鸟类 哈德蒙特带我们去荒地的
Wilhelm's father studies birds and the Hardyments took us to the moors.

804
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,300
跟我讲讲这件事
Tell me about that.

805
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,880
没什么好讲的
There's nothing to tell.

806
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,700
我们不喜欢哈德蒙特 我肯定哈德蒙特也不喜欢我们
We don't like the Hardyments and I'm sure the Hardyments don't like us.

807
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,360
但是甘特很开心
But Gunter is happy.

808
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:52,060
非常开心
So happy.

809
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,600
嗯 有人想要抢他的照相机
Well, someone tried to snatch his camera.

810
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,140
没得逞 但威尔海姆十分生气
They didn't get it, but Wilhelm was very angry.

811
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:04,200
他想找出这个人 因为事情发生在甘特离开河边时
He wanted to find this person, because it happened while Gunter was off at the lake.

812
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:08,720
但是甘特说 算了 算了 然后我们就没追究
But then Gunter was saying, leave it, leave it, so we leave it.

813
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:12,580
拜托了 我必须得重申 因为我知道
Please, I have to keep saying this, because I know it is true.

814
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:18,500
威尔海姆绝不可能杀害他的父亲 绝对不会 这点我确定
Wilhelm could never have killed his father, never. This I know.

815
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:27,800
你丈夫因从他父亲那里偷钱构成欺诈罪而被调查 弗 斯科美克 
Your husband is being investigated for fraud, Frau Schmeikel, for stealing from his father.

816
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:33,000
可能是他预料到他父亲不会给他继承权 你知道这件事吗
Perhaps in anticipation of his father disinheriting him. Did you know that?

817
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,380
他从没跟你讲过 对吗
He never told you, did he?

818
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:42,820
好好想想吧
Do some thinking, please.

819
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:51,800
- 詹特利先生 - 卡艾纳
- Mr Gently. - China.

820
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:56,420
有人让我接了一个来自不来梅港市的电话 是那儿的警察打来的
I was asked to take a call from Bremen, from the police there.

821
00:54:56,420 --> 00:55:01,460
他们不会说英文 但是你得知道这个 半小时前
They couldn't speak English, but wanted you to know that, half an hour ago,

822
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:03,980
威尔海姆斯科美克从他的银行账户里
Wilhelm Schmeikel instructed his bank

823
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:08,580
转了5000英镑到约翰巴克斯警长的账户里
to transfer five grand into the account of Sergeant John Bacchus.

824
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:13,800
他们想知道是否应该转这笔账
And they want to know whether they should let the transfer go ahead?

825
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,640
- 巴克斯在哪儿 - 他刚进来 长官
-Where is Sergeant Bacchus? - He's just come in, sir.

826
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,820
拷着那个德国人
With the German in handcuffs.

827
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:22,580
- 他看上去很开心 - 头儿...
- Looking very happy with himself. - Guv...

828
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:27,760
威尔海姆斯科美克想要录口供 我会为你安排好的
Wilhelm Schmeikel wishes to make a statement. I'll get him lined up for you.

829
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:29,080
现在还不是时候 警长
Not yet, Sergeant.

830
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,160
可以 让他们转
Yes. Tell them to go ahead with it.

831
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:35,960
跟我走
With me, please.

832
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,660
我 额...
I, er...

833
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:47,400
在罗伯特斯特拉顿这人身上需要点你的意见
I want your opinion on Robert Stratton.

834
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,580
可现在在这儿了 现在我们把这带来了
They're here now, we've got 'em now!

835
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:54,100
我跟你讲让它随着时间溃烂得了
I'm talking about you letting it fester for years, man!

836
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:57,040
在这个时候我觉得这样做最好 詹特利先生
I thought it was the best thing to do at the time! Mr Gently.

837
00:55:58,340 --> 00:55:59,900
看我们刚刚挖到了什么
Look what we just dug up!

838
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:03,440
- 我们需要尽快给威尔海姆录口供 - 你跟着我
- We must talk to Wilhelm as quickly as possible. - You stick with me.

839
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:06,160
是我发现莫莉的 你知道的
I was the one who found Molly, y'see,

840
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:10,280
她躺在床上 拿着这个盒子
and there she was, on the bed, holding this box.

841
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:15,900
- 当我看到这些时... - 你本该看看内容或是告诉别人这件事
- And when I saw them... - You should've read them or told somebody about 'em!

842
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:18,640
那样做不对 这些东西太隐私了
It wouldn't have been right. They were too personal!

843
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,820
她又没有把它们藏起来 不是吗
She wasn't hiding them, was she?!

844
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:26,220
我不想有人做些愚蠢的事 比如说去找那个让她做出这样的事的人
I didn't want anyone doing anything stupid like going after whoever had made her do such a thing. that's why I do that

845
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:33,500
我把它们拿出来到她以前常坐的地方 然后我看了这些东西...后来把他们埋在了树下
I took 'em outside to where she used to sit and read and...buried 'em under a tree.

846
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:37,840
你在胡说些什么
Now what yer blabbing for?

847
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:41,950
因为他觉得甘特的事是我们的吉米干的 对吗
Cos he thinks our Jimmy did for Gunter, don't yer?!

848
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:45,840
如果是吉米干的 那我们不都参与其中了 他跟我们在一起的
Well, if our Jimmy done it, we're all in it, aren't we? He was with us!

849
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:50,260
这些都有将近20年了 我是说 这些能证明些什么呢
These must be nearly 20 years old! I mean, what are they gonna prove?!

850
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:53,500
我们看看能证明什么 好吗
Let's find out, shall we?

851
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:57,620
我不要打开它们 我不想知道这些信是哪里来的
I'm not opening 'em! I don't wanna know who they're from.

852
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,000
我可以吗
May I?

853
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:09,900
当你带甘特去荒地时
When you took Gunter out onto the moors,

854
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:14,280
我想你见到过罗伯特斯特拉顿 其中的一个看门人
I gather you met Robert Stratton, one of the wardens.

855
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,380
鲍勃斯特拉顿 是见到过
Bob Stratton, aye.

856
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:21,120
甘特正跟我们讲他被击倒的那个晚上 然后鲍勃便加入了
Gunter was telling us about the night he got shot down, and Bob joined with.

857
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:26,180
- 甘特后来跟他一起走了 - 嗯 我让他带甘特去湖边的
- And Gunter went off with him? - Well, I asked him to show him down to the lake.

858
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:28,260
你认识罗伯特斯特拉顿多长时间了
How long have you known Robert Stratton?

859
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:30,880
他是战后刚来这儿的
Came here just after the war.

860
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:37,900
他来自桑德兰 （英国英格兰东北部港市） 他的生活可真悲惨 妻子精神一直不好 还有那可怜的姑娘 他的...
A Sunderland man. What a life he has, wife on the verge all the time and that poor lassie of his...

861
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,200
他做了该做的一切 他是个好家伙
He does everything. He's a sound bloke.

862
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:49,780
它们全被审查过 我是说 这上面线索寥寥无几
They're all censored. I mean, there's a few clues and that.

863
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:54,980
如果看到电话亭 你介意停一下吗 我得打个电话 很快的
If we see a phone-box, d'you mind if I stop and make a quick call?

864
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:59,000
- 有什么急事吗 - 没什么急事
- Something urgent? - No.

865
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:21,440
- 你好 - 你好
- Hello. - Hello.

866
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,360
- 我们可以... - 进去吧 进去吧 进去吧
- Can we...? Come in, come in! Come in.

867
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:28,580
敲门声 有人吗 哦 哦 抱歉 抱歉
HE KNOCKS ON DOOR Hello? Oh! Oh, sorry. Sorry.

868
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:31,180
水溅声 能给我们点时间吗 
WATER SPLASHES > Can you give us a minute, please?

869
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:34,340
这是我妈妈 她就在里面
It's me mam, she's in the altogether.

870
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:38,780
- 我妈妈 她在里面 你看 - 我们会等会的
- Me mam, she's in the altogether. Look. - Yeah, we'll wait.

871
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:39,260
爱丽丝 进来 进来吧
Alice, come on. Pack it in! Come on.

872
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:46,100
额 抱歉 我妻子现在不能自己洗澡或穿衣服
Er, sorry, me wife can't wash or dress herself at the moment.

873
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:48,340
斯特拉顿先生
Mr Stratton.

874
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:50,220
我本打算去找你的
Yeah, I was gonna come and see you.

875
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:56,980
因为我意识到我之前也见过旅馆的那对年轻的德国夫妇
Cos I realised that I must have also seen that young German couple from the hotel before.

876
00:58:57,180 --> 00:59:02,180
在荒地时 和哈德蒙特家一起的 我是说那时我没跟他们讲过话 但是 额...
On the moors, part of the Hardyment group. I mean, I never spoke to them at the time, but, er...

877
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:08,540
我猜他们也没认出我来 因为如果认出的话他们可能在旅馆时会说点什么的
I guess they didn't recognise me either cos they would've said something at the hotel, perhaps.

878
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:16,880
那年轻的夫人说当甘特斯科美克跟你走了然后回来时
It's just that the young wife says that when Gunter Schmeikel came back from going off with you,

879
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,380
抱怨有人想抢他的照相机
he complained that someone tried to snatch his camera.

880
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,640
什么 她说是...我没偷...
What? She said it was... I didn't steal...

881
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:25,890
我干嘛要偷他的照相机 你听着
Why would I steal his camera? Now listen, no.

882
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:28,120
不 他是个 他是个怪人
No, he was a, he was a strange one, that one.

883
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:33,600
我并没有讲她指责是你干的 斯特拉顿先生 但请继续说
I didn't say that she'd accused you, Mr Stratton. But please go on.

884
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,900
甘特斯科美克哪里奇怪了
Gunter Schmeikel was strange in what way?

885
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,040
你知道的 他很奇怪...
Well, you know, he was odd...

886
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:44,760
开始时很友好 但是当我们到达河边时
Nice enough to start off with, but when we got down to the lake,

887
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:47,920
他转向我们 说"继续 继续"
he turns on us, "Go. Go on. Go on!"

888
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:52,140
并开始说我在监视他
and starts saying I was spying on him.

889
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:53,500
嗯 然后我就走开了 让他自己发疯去
Well, you know, I just walk away. I leave him to it.

890
00:59:54,400 --> 01:00:00,740
这个人在前一天下午行为那么古怪
And yet, this was the man who was behaving so strangely earlier in the afternoon,

891
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:04,800
但在码头时你却没认出他
that you failed to recognise him at the quayside?

892
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:08,920
是的 对此我已经做出过解释了
Yeah, well, I've already explained that!

893
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:12,160
码头的人没让我联想到那个人 一次也没有
The man at the quayside didn't bring to mind that man, not once.

894
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:16,800
意大利 44
Italy '44...

895
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:20,820
达拉谟步兵团
Durham Light Infantry?

896
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:23,740
是的
Aye.

897
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:25,340
你呢
You?

898
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,700
米德尔塞克斯团 然后...
Middlesex Regiment, then...

899
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:32,000
..加入了柴郡团
..joined up with the Cheshire.

900
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,980
应该对你们有点打击
Took a bit of a hammering.

901
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:41,900
-是的 - 大部分时间我们部队都很平静
- They did. - We had a quiet time for the most part.

902
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:53,060
- 抱歉 我觉得你的妻子... - 不
- Sorry, I think your wife's... - No.

903
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:57,620
别 别 不 进来 进来
Come on. Come on. No. In. In. Come on.

904
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,140
爱丽丝 不要这样 别这样做 爱丽丝
Alice, don't. Don't do that, Alice.

905
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:04,380
爱丽丝 离火远点
Don't! Alice, come away from the fire.

906
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,160
离火远点 这才是个乖姑娘
Away from the fire. There's a good girl.

907
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:12,340
谢谢 谢谢
Thank you. Thanks.

908
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:17,100
你工作时怎么办
What happens when you're working?

909
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:19,900
他们待在房间里
They stay in their rooms.

910
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:22,200
那是...
Does that...?

911
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,120
他把她们锁起来吗
Does he lock 'em in?

912
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,180
斯特拉顿是嫌疑人吗
Is Stratton a suspect?

913
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:37,400
当然是的 怎么这么问
Yeah, of course he is. Why?

914
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:41,060
那这会帮助你还是会阻碍你
Would that help or hinder you?

915
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:44,800
- 不明白你的问题 - 那对你是有利还是有弊
- Don't understand the question. Would that be good or bad for you?

916
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:46,540
对我
For me?!

917
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:50,440
我糊涂了 头儿
I don't get you, guv.

918
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,020
不来梅港的警察打电话来了
The police in Bremen rang.

919
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:58,020
威尔海姆斯科美克往你账户里转了5000英镑
Wilhelm Schmeikel's transferring L5,000 into your account.

920
01:01:58,020 --> 01:02:00,780
- 我想告诉你的 - 嗯 你有两个小时的时间告诉我
- I was gonna tell ya. - Well, you've had two hours.

921
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:04,140
我在等钱到位
I was waiting for the money to be in place.

922
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:06,300
那会改变他的想法
It could've changed his mind!

923
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:08,500
继续撒谎 警长
Try again, Sergeant.

924
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:12,040
听着...
Look...

925
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:18,060
好吧 我想向你证明我能以我的方式办好事情
OK, I wanted to prove to you that I could get things done, my way!

926
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:20,780
头儿 拜托 听我说
Look, guv. Guv, listen, please.

927
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:24,300
你想想 这家伙没想承认罪行 不是吗
Think about it! The guy wasn't just gonna go and confess, was he?

928
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:25,840
那这就是证据
This is proof!

929
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:30,940
- 这5000英镑会让他得到什么 - 20000 - 20000
- What was he gonna get for his 5,000? - 20,000. - 20?!

930
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:34,040
现在只有五千 只要我把他送遣回国就能拿到剩下的钱
Five now and the rest when I got him extradited to Germany.

931
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,360
你不能这么做
You can't do that!

932
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:38,180
我知道 但是他不知道 不是吗
Well, I know that! But he doesn't know that, does he?

933
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:42,120
他绝望了 绝望了 因为他有罪
He's desperate. He's desperate, because he's guilty.

934
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,900
那吉米哈德蒙特以及哈德蒙特一家呢
What about Jimmy Hardyment and the Hardyment family?

935
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,480
吉米的指纹遍布钱包
Jimmy's fingerprints are all over the wallet.

936
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:49,900
你对罗伯特斯特拉顿的记忆间断就没有怀疑吗
Are you not bothered about Robert Stratton's memory lapses?

937
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,620
长官 威尔海姆斯科美克杀了他父亲
Sir, Wilhelm Schmeikel killed his father,

938
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:55,920
为了躲避这个 他试图买票回家
and in an attempt to avoid the news, tried to buy his way home!

939
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,360
谢谢 对 很好
Thank you. Right. Very good.

940
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:04,220
是的 我们现在需要把这5000英镑转回到...
Yes, we now need to transfer the 5,000 back to the...

941
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:06,260
什么
What?

942
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:12,500
多少钱
By how much?

943
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,300
我一会儿回给你好吗
Can I call you back, please?

944
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:23,180
谢谢
Thank you.

945
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:28,820
你账户的钱不够退还5000英镑 只能退还
Your bank can't repay the full L5,000. They can only manage...

946
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:32,040
4782英镑
L4,782.

947
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:35,220
我的透支额
My overdraft.

948
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:37,980
你所超支的金额最终被填补了
Which you exceeded and has consequently been cancelled,

949
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:41,060
也就说 目前你受贿了
meaning, as of now, you just took a bribe.

950
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:44,600
不 长官...你知道事实不是这样的
No, sir... You know that's not true!

951
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:46,700
让我告诉你我知道什么吧
No, let me tell you what I know.

952
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:50,700
你决定走捷径让威尔海姆的罪名成立
You decided to cut corners to incriminate Wilhelm Schmeikel,

953
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:54,060
而你最后做到的是让自己变得有罪
and what you've really managed to do is incriminate yourself.

954
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:00,700
找出这些信是谁写的
Find out who the man is in those letters.

955
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,940
他的名字被黑掉了
His name is blacked out.

956
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,660
他笑了笑
HE SCOFFS

957
01:04:06,350 --> 01:04:08,320
这个任务很简单 警长
It's a simple task, Sergeant.

958
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:11,860
- 这信上记录了很多详细的东西 - 这事谁都能干
- There's lots of circumstantial stuff in them. - Anyone can do that.

959
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:14,120
是的 那快去做啊
Yeah, so go and do it.

960
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:18,850
- 这是对我的惩罚 是吗 - 我不在乎你怎么看待的
- My punishment, is it? - I don't care how you look at it.

961
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:21,580
Just do as I tell you for once!!

962
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:24,100
What are you gonna do while I'm stuck in some office

963
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:26,180
30 miles away for the rest of the night?

964
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:29,620
I'll talk to some senior officers who might just be able to save you

965
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:32,860
from a dishonourable discharge from the police service!

966
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:34,380
Hello.

967
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:38,060
Speaking.

968
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:41,500
Tomorrow?

969
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:43,940
Just hold on a minute.

970
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:54,380
Yes, that will be fine.

971
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:19,820
Good work.

972
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:22,060
Good work, Detective Sergeant Bacchus.

973
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:29,860
Exc..

974
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:31,580
Excuse me!

975
01:05:31,580 --> 01:05:32,740
Hello?!

976
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:34,540
There's no need to shout in here.

977
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:37,500
Can I move on to the Ss, please. Aye.

978
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,380
Thank you. S for Stratton.

979
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:59,420
Yes, I can feel myself inhabiting the role of the detective.

980
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:02,540
Accumulating information,

981
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:07,820
examining motives and evidence, you know.

982
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:11,340
But I tell yer how I decide who's done it,

983
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:17,180
cos it might be useful to you as a technique, y'know?

984
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:19,820
Out of the mouths of babes in China...

985
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:23,540
What I do is this -

986
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:25,980
I ask myself,

987
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:31,380
who would you not want to be right now, China?

988
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:34,300
What's it like speaking German after all these years?

989
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:37,860
It's not the speaking of it...

990
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:41,340
It's hearing it again.

991
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:48,460
So...

992
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:52,380
Are you not going to ask me who I think done it?!

993
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:54,860
Nope. I think you should get some sleep, China.

994
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:58,300
German Police and Embassy officials first thing in the morning.

995
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:00,820
Right, Mr Gently.

996
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:24,660
Robert Stratton.

997
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:26,500
Robert Stratton...

998
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:30,260
"By the King's order the name of Corporal Robert C Stratton,

999
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:31,700

1001
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:39,980
"as mentioned in a dispatch for distinguished service.

1002
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:44,340
"I am charged to record His Majesty's high appreciation."

1003
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:46,180
Signed Secretary of State for War.

1004
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:49,660
Mentioned in a dispatch for what?

1005
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:57,380
Bloody hell! He killed three men with his own hands.

1006
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:03,220
Ich flehe Sie an, bitte...

1007
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:04,420
KNOCK ON DOOR

1008
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:10,180
Ich moechte an die deutsche Justiz ausgeliefert werden.

1009
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:13,940
Full post-mortem report, and DS Bacchus is on the phone for you.

1010
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:16,700
Thank you. Taylor? Sir.

1011
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:19,900
I sent someone to fetch Mr Stratton in. Is he here yet?

1012
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:21,540
I'll go and check for you, sir.

1013
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:32,140
Sir, I've got the identity of the man in the letters. Molly's man.

1014
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:35,580
Right, he was based up here with the Royal Signals from '45

1015
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:38,980
till he was posted to Palestine, where he died of diphtheria.

1016
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:42,260
Now this was two weeks before Molly Hardyment killed herself.

1017
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:45,860
And he was married, which may have some bearing.

1018
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:49,340
Although, of course, none of this actually solves anything,

1019
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:51,460
since the important thing is that people thought

1020
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:53,900
it might have been down to Gunter.

1021
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:57,460
D'you wanna say something, guv?

1022
01:08:58,980 --> 01:09:00,420
Well done. Well done.

1023
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:03,740
Right. Am I still on the case?

1024
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:07,140
You were never off it, or didn't you notice?

1025
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:10,060
Sometimes we have to take the long way round, Sergeant.

1026
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:12,740
Yeah, it's amazing what a bit of donkey work can do, innit?

1027
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:16,180
Now, listen, I came up with one more thing. It's the...

1028
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:18,940
Yeah, tell me when you see me.

1029
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:44,060
Well? Doesn't look good, Mr Gently.

1030
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:47,260
He's begging to be extradited... and admitting everything.

1031
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:48,940
He admitted killing his father?

1032
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:52,580
Well, he said he'd say he did it if they sent him back to Germany.

1033
01:09:52,580 --> 01:09:55,900
But then he said he didn't do it.

1034
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,980
One thing's for certain, Mr Gently.

1035
01:09:57,980 --> 01:09:59,140
He don't want to hang.

1036
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:02,860
Do you think he did it? Yes.

1037
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:04,380
Well, no.

1038
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:07,380
Well, maybe.

1039
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:10,980
The Germans think he did it, sir.

1040
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:14,020
Hm.

1041
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:19,140
I ask you, Chief Inspector, if I wanted to kill him,

1042
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:22,100
why wouldn't I have done it out at sea?

1043
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:23,660
Claim it as an accident?!

1044
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:25,620
You can't sail.

1045
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:28,620
And your wife was with you.

1046
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:30,900
I did not kill my father!

1047
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:34,900
And I'd be inclined to believe you, because,

1048
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:37,580
to do this,

1049
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:40,740
to inflict this amount of pain...

1050
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:45,380
and I am assured he would have been in extreme agony... Well...

1051
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:49,620
There are simpler and less suspicious ways

1052
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:51,860
to dispatch a father.

1053
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:53,820
However, in your latest statement,

1054
01:10:53,820 --> 01:11:00,100
you still insist that you walked down to the quayside with your wife.

1055
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:06,260
The truth, Mr Schmeikel, might just save your life.

1056
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:09,460
However, if you persist...

1057
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:13,060
It was too suspicious to say that I was there on my own.

1058
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:17,020
I am being investigated for stealing from my father.

1059
01:11:17,020 --> 01:11:18,700
Oh.

1060
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:20,620
Good. Better...

1061
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:25,660
So, who saw you on your own?

1062
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:28,340
The Hardyments.

1063
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:30,740
They were the first to pass you, yeah?

1064
01:11:30,740 --> 01:11:32,500
The first, no.

1065
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:35,220
The only ones. There were no others.

1066
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:42,140
Mr Schmeikel, you were seen and passed by two cars.

1067
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:44,860
No, by the Hardyments only.

1068
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:47,740
There were no other cars!

1069
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:51,140
You're telling me, no other cars?!

1070
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:57,020
Parked cars, yes.

1071
01:11:57,020 --> 01:11:59,180
One on the street and one on the harbour.

1072
01:11:59,180 --> 01:12:01,580
The harbour one. What make?

1073
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:05,900
A small family car.

1074
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:07,420
Blue, I think.

1075
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:11,620
Where's Stratton? What room's he in?!

1076
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:13,460
Oh, he's still not here, sir.

1077
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:35,980
Mr Stratton.

1078
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:43,420
Hello!

1079
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:45,340
Mr Stratton!

1080
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:48,780
Anybody!

1081
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:04,540
BANGING

1082
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:12,820
You all right, son? Yes, sir.

1083
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:18,820
Where's the wife and daughter?

1084
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:23,300
Upstairs, I think, but he went out maybe five, ten minutes ago.

1085
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:54,660
What're yer doing?

1086
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:56,100
Why are yer pulling us?!

1087
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:58,540
Just taking a short cut. Wanna get to the top.

1088
01:13:58,540 --> 01:14:01,500
I don't want to. I don't like it.

1089
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:11,980
TYRES SCREECH

1090
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:17,900
No!

1091
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:19,940
Come on, Alice.

1092
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:24,340
Come on.

1093
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:50,580
When was...

1094
01:14:50,580 --> 01:14:52,700
the best time up here?

1095
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:54,220
When was that, do you reckon?

1096
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:57,300
When it was frosty.

1097
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:03,500
It was cold and frosty.

1098
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:06,060
It was a cold and frosty morning!

1099
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:09,180
I remember. The mist was down there, wasn't it?

1100
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:13,580
Was...was like,

1101
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:15,620
like we were in heaven!

1102
01:15:15,620 --> 01:15:19,740
Like, like me and you were angels.

1103
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:21,180
Dad!

1104
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:27,300
Let her go!

1105
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:28,940
Stratton!

1106
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:31,260
Let her go!

1107
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:52,500
There's a good girl.

1108
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:55,380
Come on.

1109
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:11,220
Sir? What?

1110
01:16:11,220 --> 01:16:13,020
Call the station.

1111
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:17,140
Tell them to release Jimmy Hardyment and Schmeikel.

1112
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:20,060
And call an ambulance for Mrs Stratton.

1113
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:21,540
Non-urgent.

1114
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:44,620
Sergeant.

1115
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:46,540
Whatever part you played, thank you.

1116
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:48,580
Much appreciated, as you know.

1117
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:51,220
Let's get this straight. I did nothing to help you.

1118
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:53,740
The money's going back into your bank account.

1119
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:57,660
Personally, I think you should be done for attempting to bribe a police officer.

1120
01:16:57,660 --> 01:17:02,260
You know, Sergeant, you are really quite an unpleasant chap.

1121
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:06,500
Why don't you piss off back to where you came from?

1122
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:10,460
Auf Wiedersehen, Herr Sergeant.

1123
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:15,140
Trudi.

1124
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:17,700
Sorry.

1125
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:32,420
You joining us?

1126
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:37,900
It's fate, isn't it?

1127
01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:42,220
I could've been anywhere on the moors that day.

1128
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:46,020
And if Jim Hardyment hadn't've been there, I'd never have gone over.

1129
01:17:48,660 --> 01:17:50,900
But over I went,

1130
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:54,220
and there's this smart German bloke,

1131
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:57,620
laughing about being a bomber pilot,

1132
01:17:57,620 --> 01:18:01,300
and how he was shot down over the Tyne 20 years ago.

1133
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:06,060
Laughing about it. Aye, man.

1134
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:07,580
What?

1135
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:15,380
1944, I'm out in Italy.

1136
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:18,660
Yeah you were mentioned in dispatches, weren't you? Aye.

1137
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:20,620
For killing three guards.

1138
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:23,980
They were the enemy.

1139
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:26,300
We'd been captured.

1140
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:27,580
How did yer kill 'em?

1141
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:31,380
I have admitted killing Gunter Schmeikel.

1142
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:35,980
You broke their necks, didn't yer! There you are, there!!

1143
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:40,260
We were unarmed. We did what we had to do.

1144
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:43,500
And this time?

1145
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,340
Well, I was trying to tell you.

1146
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:50,220
Out in Italy, after we'd escaped,

1147
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:53,540
I get a letter telling us me wife and bairn have been killed

1148
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:55,300
in an air-raid in Sunderland.

1149
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:57,500
We lived in Sunderland.

1150
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:00,900
So you kill an innocent man 20 years later! Innocent? Well...

1151
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:03,780
Who's innocent in this world?

1152
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:05,180
Except me daughter.

1153
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:11,060
But I'll tell you, I'd never have thought

1154
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:14,660
I'd feel the way I did when I heard that Gerry laughing.

1155
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:17,660
I'm not saying that I never thought about me first family,

1156
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:22,540
cos what with me second wife and Alice,

1157
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:27,700
you know, who wouldn't wonder what might have been?

1158
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:29,740
But...

1159
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:33,980
That laughter, though.

1160
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:37,900
And Jim was joining in as well.

1161
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:41,180
Fair dos, cos I'd never told anyone.

1162
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:42,860
So...

1163
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:47,780
When you go off with Gunter Schmeikel on the moors...

1164
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:50,220
Oh, I'm gonna confront him. And I do.

1165
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:53,900
But before I mean to, cos suddenly...

1166
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:57,140
This is the new Canon.

1167
01:19:57,140 --> 01:19:59,580
You know about cameras?

1168
01:19:59,580 --> 01:20:01,940
It's the world's first.

1169
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:04,340
You think I want to look at your bloody camera?

1170
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:08,660
What do you do?! You think you can carry on like nothing's happened.

1171
01:20:08,660 --> 01:20:11,660
Like, standing around laughing and smiling.

1172
01:20:11,660 --> 01:20:13,500
Well, not in front of me, mate.

1173
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:14,740
Just go away.

1174
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:16,260
Not in front of me!

1175
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:23,420
Don't think he knew what was happening,

1176
01:20:23,420 --> 01:20:25,500
cos I'm like,

1177
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:29,460
you know, tongue-tied. I can't get me words out.

1178
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:31,140
And...

1179
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:32,980
Well, I'm embarrassed.

1180
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:36,620
And I wander off.

1181
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:44,660
Yesterday evening, when I knew I wasn't gonna get away with this,

1182
01:20:44,660 --> 01:20:48,220
I thought about telling yer that I went to see him the following night

1183
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:50,820
to apologise and it got out of hand,

1184
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:54,420
how I didn't mean to kill him, y'know, go for manslaughter.

1185
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:57,780
But that still left us with the same problem.

1186
01:20:57,780 --> 01:20:59,900
Me wife and Alice, cos with me in prison,

1187
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:03,020
them two's put away in mental homes and...

1188
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:05,900
So...

1189
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:07,620
Better to kill them?

1190
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:13,180
Better if you'd've let us kill Alice, aye.

1191
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:18,180
You frequent loony bins, do yer?

1192
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:20,260
No, you know all about them though, yeah?

1193
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:23,260
Well, try putting your own children in them!

1194
01:21:23,260 --> 01:21:25,300
If she were dead, I'd be joining her.

1195
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:28,140
As it is, she's left here, cared for by who? You?!!

1196
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:31,860
You?

1197
01:21:35,420 --> 01:21:37,820
And I keep feeling this...

1198
01:21:41,180 --> 01:21:44,220
Me, the quiet man,

1199
01:21:44,220 --> 01:21:46,820
the patient man everyone admires.

1200
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:52,460
But from when I got home after that tussle...

1201
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:57,140
..I got angry.

1202
01:21:57,140 --> 01:22:00,100
I can't tell yer. I can't sleep for this rage.

1203
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:02,460
Have I got to do everything by me bloody self?

1204
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:05,300
Can you not see that the bloody fire's gone out?!

1205
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:09,300
I can't stop hearing him laughing, like he's laughing at me life.

1206
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:12,180
Some wood on the fire!

1207
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:18,180
And I knew I was gonna kill him.

1208
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:23,300
And end it?

1209
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:28,220
How did the opportunity arise?

1210
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:32,420
Well, like everything in life, you need the luck.

1211
01:22:32,420 --> 01:22:34,940
I figured rich folk like that would be staying at the hotel

1212
01:22:34,940 --> 01:22:35,980
so I went there first.

1213
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:40,060
Yes. We will be spending the last night on the boat.

1214
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:42,100
My father's already having drinks...

1215
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:46,900
There's his son settling his bill and telling the receptionist everything I needed to know.

1216
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:50,340
Where his dad was, what time they were meeting him.

1217
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:52,700
We will go and meet my father soon.

1218
01:22:53,940 --> 01:22:57,620
So I drive down to the Mariners, go in...

1219
01:22:57,620 --> 01:22:59,220
RAUCOUS SINGING

1220
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:03,900
And there's laughing boy up and singing Geordie songs to everyone!

1221
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:05,900
So that helps fuel us.

1222
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:10,980
But there's too many folk around, so I take meself off to the quay,

1223
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:13,180
cos I know he's meeting his son there.

1224
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:15,180
And I wait.

1225
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:20,660
Why did you admit to being the fella in the car?

1226
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:22,420
Well, I didn't know who'd seen us.

1227
01:23:22,420 --> 01:23:25,820
Could've been the Hardyments, in which case, why hadn't I,

1228
01:23:25,820 --> 01:23:28,060
y'know, owned up?

1229
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:30,780
By this time I was still hoping to get away with it.

1230
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:34,700
So you stitch up the son?

1231
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:39,260
Can we stick to the order of events?

1232
01:23:39,260 --> 01:23:41,940
You're back on the quayside.

1233
01:23:41,940 --> 01:23:43,940
I take it Shavers came and went?

1234
01:23:43,940 --> 01:23:45,500
Thank God.

1235
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:46,780
And then?

1236
01:23:46,780 --> 01:23:49,460
Well, just in case this Gunter came,

1237
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:54,900
I parked in the shadows and waited and hoped.

1238
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:57,260
I gave meself a time frame of 10.14.

1239
01:23:57,260 --> 01:23:59,980
If he hasn't turned up, I'm out of there.

1240
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:01,700
At nine minutes past...

1241
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:04,180
GUNTER SINGS

1242
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:08,180
?Saved coos an' calves

1243
01:24:08,180 --> 01:24:14,620
?O' the famous Lambton worm. ?
 1246 01:24:32,380 --> 01:24:33,540 CRACKING

1244
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:49,220
And then I heard someone coming.

1245
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:55,500
But I'm happy to wait for him to go now, cos I knew.

1246
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:59,420
When your Gunter went in the water,

1247
01:24:59,420 --> 01:25:01,020
he went in alive.

1248
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:07,700
Why was that so important?

1249
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:11,180
Why not just snap his neck and kill him?

1250
01:25:11,180 --> 01:25:13,740
Cos when my wife and bairn died in that raid,

1251
01:25:13,740 --> 01:25:16,140
they weren't killed by a direct hit.

1252
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:17,940
They were in the cellar

1253
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:20,420
and a water-main burst.

1254
01:25:20,420 --> 01:25:24,220
But they couldn't get 'em out cos of the fallen masonry.

1255
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:26,700
So they drowned.

1256
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:32,380
Let's all have a laugh, eh?

1257
01:25:42,660 --> 01:25:45,180
Ah, good, you're still here. Come with me.

1258
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:46,820
Guv?

1259
01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:54,180
I found out about Stratton's war record last night.

1260
01:25:55,260 --> 01:25:58,060
I knew when we spoke on the phone...

1261
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:03,460
But if I'd told you last night,

1262
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:06,340
his wife would still be alive now, wouldn't she?

1263
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:12,220
For better or for worse.

1264
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:20,020
Come on!

1265
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:22,620
I want to show you something.

1266
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:30,340
Stay!

1267
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:31,540
Stay.

1268
01:26:31,540 --> 01:26:35,460
That's right, you tell 'em. You show them who's the boss. Come on!

1269
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:39,740
Now make a fuss of 'em.

1270
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:41,780
Good doggies.

1271
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:44,620
Right, we'll be heading back, Mr Gently.

1272
01:26:44,620 --> 01:26:47,980
I'm gonna look after the chickens and the ducks,

1273
01:26:47,980 --> 01:26:50,220
and the geese.

1274
01:26:50,220 --> 01:26:51,380
And the doggies.

1275
01:26:51,380 --> 01:26:53,580
Thank you.

1276
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:55,060
That's what we're here for.

1277
01:26:56,460 --> 01:26:57,700
Come on then. Eh!

1278
01:26:57,700 --> 01:27:02,380
Right, now we have to repay that bribe you took.

1279
01:27:02,380 --> 01:27:04,740
Sir, it wasn't a bribe.

1280
01:27:04,740 --> 01:27:06,860
I ran up an overdraft limit.

1281
01:27:06,860 --> 01:27:10,580
Right, well let's clear it. Here. Have this.

1282
01:27:10,580 --> 01:27:12,020
Go on.

1283
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:13,980
Oh, no. No, I'm not taking that.

1284
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:16,580
Yes, you are. You can repay me 拢10 a month. No.

1285
01:27:16,580 --> 01:27:18,420
拢10 a month without fail.

1286
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:19,980
I don't want it, sir. Have it.

1287
01:27:19,980 --> 01:27:23,060
There's enough in there, so you can keep the MG as well.

1288
01:27:23,060 --> 01:27:25,900
Can't have you driving around in something sensible.

1289
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:27,940
Tomorrow, first thing.

1290
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:31,540
(WHISTLES) In you go.

1291
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:34,140
Thank you, sir.

1292
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:54,860
