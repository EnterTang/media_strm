421
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:50,920
那些我们总是吵的事 这些烂事...
What it's always about. This, this...and this.

422
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,280
她差不多一天后会回来
She'll be back in a day or so.

423
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,200
十分狼狈
In a right mess 

424
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,120
"我很抱歉 Lee 请你原谅我 Lee"
"I'm so sorry, Lee. Please forgive me, Lee."

425
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,880
对 是啊 直到她下次再这样
Yeah, right. Till the next time.

426
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:11,360
只是 她从来没离开过那么久
Only, she's never stayed away this long before.

427
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,280
我们吵架的时候她就睡在这里
She sleeps in here when we've had a ruck

428
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,080
这几天就是这样
which is like always these days.

429
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,160
你是涂料用完了吗?
Did you run out of paint?

430
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,400
我想让她振奋起来
I was trying to cheer her up a bit.

431
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,440
她却发疯 咆哮着说
She went mental, ranting on about how

432
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,880
她只配住铁屋子
she didn't deserve nothing apart from a hard room.

433
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,400
然后她就走了
And then she just buggered off.

434
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,200
我只是想让她开心
I just want her to be happy.

435
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,840
我们需要张照片
We'll need a photo.

436
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,040
是个恶作剧 都是胡闹
It was mischief. A prank.

437
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,120
但是那些文件让这事看起来成了某种邪恶的仪式
But the papers made out it was some sort of Satanic ritual.

438
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,840
而事实是
The truth is,

439
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,440
从没有人把Jenny和我教育得懂得是非曲直
Jenny and I were never taught the difference between right and wrong.

440
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,040
直到你们遇到Helen Jenkins?
Until you met Helen Jenkins?

441
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,920
她当然觉得她懂道理 并且知道怎么教我们
She certainly thought she knew the difference and how to teach us.

442
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,880
为什么你之前没提到这事?
Why didn't you mention this before?

443
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,200
看起来无关啊
Didn't seem relevant.

444
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,040
那是很久以前的事了 我们那时都还是孩子
It was such a long time ago and we were kids.

445
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,320
孤儿院关门的时候 我想离它尽可能的远
When the home closed, I wanted to get as far away from it as possible.

446
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,680
我知道我一直不好
I knew I'd been bad

447
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,320
但似乎那是个重新开始的理想时刻
but it seemed like an ideal moment to make a new start.

448
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,040
问题是 Jenny做不到
Problem was, Jenny couldn't.

449
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,320
她跟错了人 我们就分道扬镳了
She got in with the wrong crowd and we went our separate ways.

450
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,960
但你们曾经很亲密?
But you were close once?

451
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,640
曾经
Once.

452
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,520
她曾是这个世界上我唯一的朋友 Mathias先生
She was the only friend I had in the world, Mr Mathias.

453
00:44:10,806 --> 00:44:15,757
Helen很为Catrin骄傲

454
00:44:18,396 --> 00:44:22,043
她觉得她一定会有所成就

455 
00:44:22,043 --> 00:44:24,116
她没有Jenny成功

456
00:44:26,161 --> 00:44:29,802
这个嘛...Jenny遇到Helen的时候已经是一缕迷失的灵魂了

457
00:44:30,811 --> 00:44:33,278
Jenny有没有向你倾诉过?

458
00:44:34,322 --> 00:44:36,882
我鼓励所有的孩子来和我交流

459
00:44:37,678 --> 00:44:40,077
但他们几乎不会说真话

460
00:44:43,641 --> 00:44:47,156
我需要你上周日穿的鞋子

461
00:44:49,803 --> 00:44:51,088
好的 当然

462
00:44:51,883 --> 00:44:54,114
我现在去拿给你

463
00:44:55,716 --> 00:44:57,364
你自便 喝点茶

464
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,120
Agnes?
Agnes?

465
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,680
Maybury!
Maybury!

466
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,280
我得找人谈谈
I need to talk to someone.

467
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,960
- Mathias - 你最好尽快赶回来 长官
- Mathias. - You'd better get back here as soon as possible, sir.

468
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,200
为什么 什么事?
Why, what is it?

469
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,440
Jenny James刚刚来自首了
Jenny James has just turned herself in.

470
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,000
她说她杀了Helen Jenkins
She says she killed Helen Jenkins.

471
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,840
你为什么躲在那 Hywel?
Why were you hiding there, Hywel?

472
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,640
你是害怕吗?
Were you scared?

473
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,840
你逃跑是不是因为你干了什么坏事?
Were you running away because you did something you were ashamed of?

474
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,600
你有没有杀Helen Jenkins Hywel?
Did you kill Helen Jenkins, Hywel?

475
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,000
- 你怎么杀死她的? - 我打了她
- How did you kill her? - I hit her.

476
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,680
用什么?
With what?

477
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,280
一个花瓶 打破了她的脑袋
A vase. Smashed her head in.

478
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,200
把那个贱人的牙齿都打出来了
Knocked the bitch's teeth out.

479
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,480
你为什么那么做?
Why did you do that?

480
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:52,680
她不用麻醉就拔我们的牙齿 就喜欢看我们受折磨
She took out our teeth with no anaesthetic, liked seeing us suffer.

481
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,120
我让她体会下她自己的医术
I gave her a taste of her own medicine.

482
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,840
之后你干嘛了?
Then what did you do?

483
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,000
刺她
Stabbed her.

484
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,240
把她拖出前门然后放在车上
Dragged her out the front door and put her in the car.

485
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,000
什么车
What sort of car?

486
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,040
一辆红色的小车
A little red one.

487
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,200
然后我开到了恶魔桥
Then I drove it up to Devil's Bridge.

488 
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,800
然后你干嘛了?
And then what did you do?

489
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,120
停在桥上
Stopped on the bridge.

490
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,840
把她拖出来 推下河
Pulled her out and shoved her into the river.

491
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,000
你有没有帮手?
Did you have help?

492
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,600
没有
No.

493
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,480
你自己一个人把她拖出车来
You took her out of the car

494
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,120
然后举过栏杆吗?
and lifted her over the parapet on your own?

495
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,000
是的
Yeah.

496
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,880
你们俩看起来都很开心
You look happy the both of you.

497
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,360
我很开心
I was happy.

498
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:48,940
她很开心
She was happy.

499
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,260
那是愉快的一天
It was a happy day.

500
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,740
听起来真美好
Sounds lovely.

501
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:55,100
跟我说说吧
Tell me about it.

502
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,220
那天是我生日
It was my birthday.

503
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:02,140
所以 我去钓鱼...
So, I went out fishing...

504
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:06,580
...然后我钓到了一条海鲈鱼 她做给我吃
..and I caught a sea bass and she cooked it for me.

505
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:08,940
Helen吗? Helen做的鱼吗?
Helen? Did Helen cook the fish?

506
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:12,820
所以因此你才星期六去那儿吗?
Is that why you went round there on Saturday?

507
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,180
她可以做饭给你吃?
So she could cook for you?

508
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:17,020
星期六发生什么了 Hywel?
What happened on Saturday, Hywel?

509
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:19,780
我很害怕
I was scared.

510
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:23,700
所以我才逃跑
That's why I ran away.

511
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:25,740
她有没有做什么让你生气的事?
Did she do something that made you angry?

512
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:28,380
不是我的错
It wasn't my fault.

513
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:32,580
我去那 是因为我曾经住在那
I went there, because I used to live there.

514
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:33,980
去Helen的房子?
To Helen's house?

515
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:36,060
那个酒店!
The hotel!

516
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:37,940
我们曾住在那 那曾是我们的家
We lived there once. It was our home.

517
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:41,660
我想我在那会安全
I thought I'd be safe.

518
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,180
但哪都不安全
But nowhere's safe.

519
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:46,660
- 他们总是唾弃我 - 谁?
- They always spit in your face. - Who does?

520
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:49,020
所有人! 他们都怪我
Everyone! They blame me.

521
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:53,380
那不是我的错!
It wasn't my fault!

522
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:55,100
Helen怪你吗 Hywel?
Did Helen blame you, Hywel?

523
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,780
所以你才生气吗?
Is that why you were angry?

524
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:02,740
她有没有吼你? 直接叫你的名字?
Did she shout at you? Did she call you names?

525
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:04,300
所以你就伤害她?
Is that why you hurt her?

526
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:07,620
Hywel!
HYWEL!

527
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:10,380
我没有伤害她! 我根本没碰她!
I didn't hurt her! I didn't touch her!

528
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:11,900
我没有 我没有!
I didn't. I didn't!

529
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:14,140
够了
That's enough.

530
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,900
他在那
He was there.

531
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:21,860
他的鞋印和小屋里的吻合 他在那
His waders match the prints in the chalet. He was there.

532
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:24,780
- 他有没有杀她? - 他肯定足够力量杀死她
- Did he kill her? - He's certainly capable of killing her.

533
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:27,700
不管他做了什么 看见什么 都深深地伤害了他
Whatever he did, whatever he saw, he's deeply traumatised by it.

534
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:31,020
- 会不会是装的? - 不 不 我认为是真的
- Could it be an act? - No, no, I think it's genuine.

535
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:32,980
DCI Mathias...?
DCI Mathias...?

536
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,140
我很抱歉
I'm sorry,

537
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:37,540
但是我的客户目前的情况不适合被询问
but my client isn't in any fit mental state to be interviewed.

538
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:40,620
我想让他在进行进一步询问前做心理评估
I'd like him psychologically assessed before further questioning.

539
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:43,180
无意冒犯 但我想你有点太着急了
With respect, I think you're being a little premature.

540
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:46,020
让我继续询问 如果他又崩溃了 那我会...
Let me continue the interview if he breaks down again, then I'll...

541
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:48,220
- 很抱歉 必须得就此打住了 - Walters女士
- I'm sorry. It has to stop now. - Ms Walters,

542
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:52,100
这是一个谋杀询问 我们首要关心的是找到凶手
this is a murder enquiry, our primary concern is, is to find the killer.

543
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,260
我可不可以提议我们相信
Can I suggest that we trust the judgment of

544
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:58,220
Haydn Blake医生的判断 他是我们警方评估Maybury先生
Dr Haydn Blake, our police surgeon in assessing Mr Maybury's

545
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:59,340
是否能继续的医生?
fitness to continue?

546
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:03,380
请随意使用我办公室里的电话 请
Feel free to use the phone in my office. Please.

547
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:19,020
Jenny 嗨
Jenny, hi.

548
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:20,420
你认识这张图吗?
Do you know this picture?

549
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:24,300
认识
Yeah.

550
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,820
她家里墙上挂着一张
She had one hanging on the wall at the home.

551
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:31,260
她在别处还有吗?
Did she have one anywhere else?

552
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:34,340
我怎么知道?
How would I know?

553
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:42,060
车后面放着一具尸体时 恶魔桥走起来挺长的
Devil's Bridge is a long way to go with a body in the back of the car.

554
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:44,140
你不担心被抓吗?
Weren't you worried about being caught?

555
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:45,500
从没想过
Never thought about it.

556
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:47,740
为什么选恶魔桥 Jenny?
Why Devil's Bridge, Jenny?

557
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:53,260
我们是坏孩子时 她就是在那接我们
It's where she took us when we'd been bad.

558
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:58,420
走到尽头...说恶魔住在那
Down the bottom... said the Devil lived there.

559
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:02,340
如果我们不忏悔
If we didn't repent
