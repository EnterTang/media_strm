1
00:00:05,531 --> 00:00:07,687
(Under the picturesque sky)

2
00:00:07,687 --> 00:00:10,319
(Running School)

3
00:00:10,631 --> 00:00:13,631
(There's a field where you can feel that autumn is in the air.)

4
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:17,801
- Hello. - Hello.

5
00:00:18,161 --> 00:00:19,801
Hello.

6
00:00:20,031 --> 00:00:22,901
(Park Mi Sun, the queen of variety shows)

7
00:00:23,261 --> 00:00:26,301
- Today is Running Man field day. - Okay.

8
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:29,231
Mi Sun will be the leader of Men's Team and...

9
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:32,801
Jae Seok will be the leader of Women's Team.

10
00:00:32,801 --> 00:00:33,861
I'm very satisfied.

11
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:36,431
Have I won the lottery or what?

12
00:00:36,631 --> 00:00:37,901
I'm so happy.

13
00:00:39,101 --> 00:00:42,931
However, you two are spies.

14
00:00:43,661 --> 00:00:45,631
(Spies?)

15
00:00:45,861 --> 00:00:49,961
Actually, Jae Seok is the spy of Men's Team.

16
00:00:49,961 --> 00:00:51,361
No, I refuse.

17
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:54,961
I like my team. Why would I ever do that?

18
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:57,831
- Why would I be a spy for them? - Me, too.

19
00:00:57,831 --> 00:01:00,061
Am I the spy of Women's Team?

20
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:03,331
You mean I must help Women's Team secretly?

21
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:06,371
It's going to be hard. I should pretend that I'm helping Men's Team.

22
00:01:06,371 --> 00:01:08,761
But in fact, I should help Women's Team, right?

23
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:11,031
- That'll be your job. - But I'm not close to any of them.

24
00:01:11,631 --> 00:01:13,661
- I hate girls prettier than me. - I know.

25
00:01:13,731 --> 00:01:17,261
- We can do well as team leaders. - They are too pretty.

26
00:01:17,261 --> 00:01:21,601
So the photos of these guys are staring at me right now.

27
00:01:22,731 --> 00:01:24,331
Well, they're just mediocre.

28
00:01:24,731 --> 00:01:26,501
- I'm not that... - I know what you mean.

29
00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:29,231
- happy about my members. - They are her friends,

30
00:01:29,231 --> 00:01:32,231
- but none of them are her type. - Exactly.

31
00:01:32,601 --> 00:01:34,101
- Here's another thing. - Okay.

32
00:01:34,131 --> 00:01:38,261
Among your team, you can pick a member to help you.

33
00:01:38,261 --> 00:01:39,861
(Team leaders can choose another spy in their team.)

34
00:01:39,861 --> 00:01:42,001
- You want me to choose a spy? - Right.

35
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:45,101
(Team leaders can choose another spy among their team.)

36
00:01:45,501 --> 00:01:47,801
But the spy you chose...

37
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:50,801
may betray you depending on the situation.

38
00:01:50,801 --> 00:01:54,101
(Spies chosen by the team leaders may betray the leaders.)

39
00:01:54,101 --> 00:02:01,561
(They may betray their leader once before the final race.)

40
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:03,531
- You mean a double spy? - Right.

41
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:06,431
- Then I must pick a decent person. - Yes.

42
00:02:06,431 --> 00:02:07,931
- Someone reliable. - You're right.

43
00:02:08,271 --> 00:02:11,101
Who would be the most reliable person among these five?

44
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:14,131
- There's none among them. - Is that so?

45
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:16,661
I know.

46
00:02:17,861 --> 00:02:22,461
(Whom will they choose?)

47
00:02:22,461 --> 00:02:26,001
- We'll start the field day. - What?

48
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:28,001
- Let's do this. - Men's Team, please line up.

49
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:30,931
Where is Jae Seok? He must be...

50
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:32,201
happy to be out on the green.

51
00:02:32,201 --> 00:02:33,801
Gary, look at you.

52
00:02:33,801 --> 00:02:35,601
- Is it still on me? - It's like an accessory.

53
00:02:35,601 --> 00:02:37,861
- A dragonfly is on him. - It seems to be comfortable.

54
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:40,771
I think it's there to hide the brand name.

55
00:02:41,501 --> 00:02:43,361
- Is it on this side or that? - It's hiding the brand name.

56
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:44,801
That's amazing.

57
00:02:44,801 --> 00:02:48,061
- You're becoming one with nature. - Today must be your day.

58
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:51,401
First, the team leader of Men's Team will enter.

59
00:02:51,401 --> 00:02:52,731
Will there be a Women's Team today?

60
00:02:52,931 --> 00:02:54,161
Is it going to be Jae Seok?

61
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:55,531
- Team leader. - What?

62
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,101
Is she going to be our leader?

63
00:02:58,031 --> 00:03:00,131
- Is she going to be our leader? - Hello.

64
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:01,301
- Hello. - Hello, Mi Sun.

65
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:04,501
(Park Mi Sun, team leader of Men's Team)

66
00:03:05,401 --> 00:03:08,601
(You are most welcome.)

67
00:03:08,601 --> 00:03:12,231
- Park Mi Sun. Park Mi Sun. - Yes.

68
00:03:12,231 --> 00:03:14,631
- Are you the leader of Men's Team? - Nice.

69
00:03:14,631 --> 00:03:15,801
(They're uniting under Mi Sun.)

70
00:03:15,961 --> 00:03:18,201
The last time you were on the show, you had to pay for our dinner.

71
00:03:18,201 --> 00:03:20,061
Right, this is the first time after that incident.

72
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:21,731
- We split the bill together. - We shared the bill.

73
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:24,861
- You're here with me again. - I never thought I'd come again.

74
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:28,601
Since you invited me again, I should visit once in a while.

75
00:03:29,661 --> 00:03:31,961
Women's Team, please enter.

76
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,661
Jae Seok must be very excited.

77
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:37,401
(He marches in proudly.)

78
00:03:38,061 --> 00:03:39,561
It's Min Kyung.

79
00:03:39,561 --> 00:03:40,701
- It's Yeon Jae. - It's Son Yeon Jae.

80
00:03:40,701 --> 00:03:41,701
It's Min Kyung.

81
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:44,161
- It's Yeon Jae. - It's Yeon Jae.

82
00:03:44,161 --> 00:03:45,861
- And there's also Yu Ra. - It's Yu Ra.

83
00:03:45,861 --> 00:03:47,031
- It's Yu Ra. - It's...

84
00:03:47,031 --> 00:03:48,331
- Ji Won. - It's Ji Won.

85
00:03:48,331 --> 00:03:50,431
- It's Ji Won. - Goodness.

86
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:51,461
(They are beautiful.)

87
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:52,631
- Hello. - Goodness.

88
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:54,731
(Nationally loved gymnast, Son Yeon Jae)

89
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:56,061
(A beauty with lovely voice, Kang Min Kyung)

90
00:03:56,061 --> 00:03:57,661
(Cute and sexy idol, Yu Ra)

91
00:03:57,661 --> 00:03:58,731
(An elegant actress, Ye Ji Won)

92
00:03:59,101 --> 00:04:03,031
(The national beauties are here on Running Man.)

93
00:04:03,531 --> 00:04:04,661
Hello.

94
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:07,301
- Cut it out, Haha. - Hey, Yeon Jae.

95
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:08,531
It's been too long.

96
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:10,501
- I said stop it. - Yeon Jae.

97
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:12,001
- Oh, my. - Stop it.

98
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,761
- Long time no see. - Get back in the line.

99
00:04:13,801 --> 00:04:15,061
- Nice to meet you. - Go away.

100
00:04:15,061 --> 00:04:16,361
- Hey, Yu Ra. - That's enough.

101
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:18,301
Hello, Ji Won.

102
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:19,531
Go away.

103
00:04:19,761 --> 00:04:21,001
It's been too long.

104
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:22,501
I'm giving you a warning.

105
00:04:22,501 --> 00:04:24,931
Don't talk down to a global star.

106
00:04:24,961 --> 00:04:26,071
What do you mean "global star"?

107
00:04:26,071 --> 00:04:27,931
Yeon Jae is a world-class athlete.

108
00:04:27,931 --> 00:04:29,861
You can't be calling her by her name like that.

109
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:30,931
How else am I supposed to call her?

110
00:04:30,931 --> 00:04:32,601
- That's her name. - As for Min Kyung,

111
00:04:32,601 --> 00:04:35,861
she's no longer the worst actress of all time.

112
00:04:36,361 --> 00:04:39,001
Why'd you bring that up?

113
00:04:39,361 --> 00:04:41,461
(Gary imitates Min Kyung's acting.)

114
00:04:41,761 --> 00:04:44,831
(Do you remember this sound?)

115
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:48,601
(This was her first main role as an actress.)

116
00:04:48,601 --> 00:04:53,131
(This scene became a legend.)

117
00:04:53,431 --> 00:04:58,231
(Her dinosaur-like cry is the key point.)

118
00:04:58,461 --> 00:04:59,931
- I still remember that one. - Don't do it.

119
00:04:59,931 --> 00:05:00,961
Isn't that how it goes?

120
00:05:01,071 --> 00:05:02,201
Don't do it.

121
00:05:02,231 --> 00:05:04,801
- Her acting got much better now. - That's right.

122
00:05:05,331 --> 00:05:06,731
Oh, I almost forgot.

123
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:08,261
Ji Won and I were in the same class,

124
00:05:08,261 --> 00:05:09,931
but she keeps insisting that I'm older.

125
00:05:09,931 --> 00:05:12,071
- He's older than me. - Why are you acting like that?

126
00:05:12,071 --> 00:05:14,631
She was my partner as the leading actress.

127
00:05:14,631 --> 00:05:17,101
- We did a drama together. - Really?

128
00:05:17,101 --> 00:05:19,001
- Of course. - We even had a kiss scene.

129
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:21,261
- Are you serious? - Which drama was that?

130
00:05:21,261 --> 00:05:23,731
(Do you remember our kiss?)

131
00:05:23,731 --> 00:05:27,071
(They locked lips passionately at the office.)

132
00:05:27,331 --> 00:05:28,531
We were a fantastic couple.

133
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:31,201
That was his first kiss after seven years.

134
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:34,031
(Their kiss scene deserves an award.)

135
00:05:34,331 --> 00:05:36,531
- I have a good feeling about today. - Me, too.

136
00:05:36,631 --> 00:05:38,731
- We haven't met for so long. - Today is Running Man field day.

137
00:05:38,731 --> 00:05:40,761
It's Men's Team against Women's Team.

138
00:05:40,761 --> 00:05:43,831
The team with the higher points will be the final winner.

139
00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:45,831
- This'll be way too easy. - They don't stand a chance.

140
00:05:45,831 --> 00:05:48,261
The winner will be awarded with luxurious prizes.

141
00:05:48,261 --> 00:05:50,061
- Luxurious prizes? - Isn't this unfair for us?

142
00:05:50,061 --> 00:05:51,361
- The teams aren't balanced. - I agree.

143
00:05:51,361 --> 00:05:52,461
- The teams are divided by gender. - We don't know the game yet.

144
00:05:52,461 --> 00:05:55,061
- It really depends on the game. - But the Women's Team...

145
00:05:55,061 --> 00:05:57,931
Each team has a spy who will prevent their team from winning.

146
00:05:58,231 --> 00:06:00,901
(There's a spy in each team.)

147
00:06:00,901 --> 00:06:01,901
Spies?

148
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,731
(There's a spy among us?)

149
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,601
Lead your team to victory while avoiding the spies.

150
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:09,461
(They will be given bonus points for ratting out the spy in the voting.)

151
00:06:09,901 --> 00:06:10,901
Spies?

152
00:06:11,531 --> 00:06:17,101
(The time has come.)

153
00:06:17,101 --> 00:06:18,631
Each team has a spy?

154
00:06:18,761 --> 00:06:21,261
Why are there spies for a field day?

155
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:24,101
Why don't I ever get to be a spy?

156
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,731
That sounds like something a spy would say.

157
00:06:26,161 --> 00:06:27,231
You're acting strange.

158
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:28,861
- Is it you, Yeon Jae? - What?

159
00:06:28,861 --> 00:06:30,331
- It's Yeon Jae. - No, it's not me.

160
00:06:30,331 --> 00:06:32,061
Yeon Jae, are you nervous?

161
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:33,401
It feels a bit strange right now.

162
00:06:34,201 --> 00:06:37,061
I think I've spent too much time in the training ground.

163
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:38,701
I basically live in the gym, too.

164
00:06:40,001 --> 00:06:43,001
- It's a different kind of exercise. - Us athletes have things in common.

165
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:44,731
One thing's for sure, Yeon Jae is a spy.

166
00:06:44,861 --> 00:06:46,131
- What? - I'm sure it's her.

167
00:06:46,131 --> 00:06:48,701
- Why are you all ganging up on me? - I think it's her, too.

168
00:06:48,931 --> 00:06:50,461
- We're ganging up on you? - Yes.

169
00:06:50,631 --> 00:06:52,531
You have a temper, don't you?

170
00:06:53,861 --> 00:06:55,001
It sounded like that.

171
00:06:55,001 --> 00:06:57,361
I love this team.

172
00:06:57,361 --> 00:06:58,861
I love my team, too.

173
00:06:58,861 --> 00:07:01,131
- This is good. - We're all friends here.

174
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:03,201
(The two team leaders are about to get some spy action.)

175
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:08,761
(Who's the other spy that each team leader picked?)

176
00:07:09,901 --> 00:07:14,131
Both of the team leaders, please come forward.

177
00:07:14,131 --> 00:07:16,501
I actually did something like this when I was in elementary school.

178
00:07:16,501 --> 00:07:18,801
The opening ceremony will be held out by the team leaders.

179
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:20,301
Variety Ceremony.

180
00:07:20,401 --> 00:07:21,531
I swear under oath.

181
00:07:21,661 --> 00:07:24,061
We will try our hardest to make the viewers laugh.

182
00:07:24,061 --> 00:07:26,001
We won't get scared of being taken bad pictures.

183
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:27,761
We will stand proud in front of the cameras...

184
00:07:27,761 --> 00:07:29,801
and try our best for every game.

185
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:33,531
We swear that we will try our very best to make the viewers laugh.

186
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,961
- We swear. - We swear.

187
00:07:35,061 --> 00:07:40,631
The 2016 Running Man Field Day will now begin.

188
00:07:40,631 --> 00:07:41,901
Let's begin.

189
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:43,831
(It begins now.)

190
00:07:45,201 --> 00:07:49,401
(Will the spies be able to carry out their secret missions?)

191
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:51,701
Let's get the field day started.

192
00:07:52,601 --> 00:07:53,701
(Arcade Games)

193
00:07:53,701 --> 00:07:56,631
I bet many of you have memories about field days.

194
00:07:56,631 --> 00:08:00,501
Back in Mi Sun's days, they held up the torch for the ceremony.

195
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:02,231
Is she that old?

196
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,201
- I remember the old days. - Are you okay?

197
00:08:04,201 --> 00:08:05,461
Are you okay, Mi Sun?

198
00:08:05,461 --> 00:08:07,031
Did you get to shoot an arrow as well?

199
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:08,631
Am I some kind of a hunter?

200
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:10,501
- What are you talking about? - Am I some kind of a hunter?

201
00:08:10,961 --> 00:08:12,601
Did you use golden coins as currency back then?

202
00:08:12,601 --> 00:08:14,101
Are you sure you're not from the Joseon Dynasty?

203
00:08:14,101 --> 00:08:16,801
Back then, field days weren't exclusive to students.

204
00:08:16,801 --> 00:08:19,161
It was a day that the whole family came and had fun together.

205
00:08:19,161 --> 00:08:21,431
My parents and grandparents would all come and play.

206
00:08:21,431 --> 00:08:23,561
I remember playing a game together.

207
00:08:23,561 --> 00:08:25,731
- We threw sandbags. - They were called ojaemi.

208
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:26,761
We would throw things at a basket...

209
00:08:26,761 --> 00:08:28,931
and when it opened, it would read, "It's lunch time."

210
00:08:28,931 --> 00:08:31,661
- You had those? - Of course.

211
00:08:31,661 --> 00:08:34,431
Field days are all about cheerleading.

212
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,831
Ding-a-ling, tring-a-ling, you've got a call

213
00:08:36,831 --> 00:08:39,061
The person on the call said White Team has won

214
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:41,501
- No, no, it's a lie - No, no, it's a lie

215
00:08:41,501 --> 00:08:43,731
The person on the call said Blue Team has won

216
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:47,231
- No, no, it's a lie - It's a lie

217
00:08:47,231 --> 00:08:48,401
I remember the old days.

218
00:08:48,401 --> 00:08:49,531
Oh, the good old days.

219
00:08:49,631 --> 00:08:51,431
We'll go on forever like this.

220
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:53,101
I'll tell you the rules of this game.

221
00:08:53,101 --> 00:08:55,761
- There's a picture behind us. - Right.

222
00:08:55,761 --> 00:08:58,561
We will start removing the paper piece by piece...

223
00:08:58,561 --> 00:09:01,361
and you have to guess who that person is.

224
00:09:01,361 --> 00:09:04,501
The winner of each round will be able to remove a piece.

225
00:09:04,601 --> 00:09:07,931
Let's get the first game started.

226
00:09:07,931 --> 00:09:10,431
It's called "Introduce Yourselves".

227
00:09:10,431 --> 00:09:12,001
- Do we pass around the bomb? - That's right.

228
00:09:12,231 --> 00:09:14,861
- Really? - You have 60 seconds.

229
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:16,331
- I'm scared. - A bomb?

230
00:09:16,331 --> 00:09:17,531
I know what this is.

231
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:22,171
(Each member introduces oneself and passes around the bomb.)

232
00:09:22,171 --> 00:09:26,561
(To win, the team has to use up the time before the bomb goes off.)

233
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:28,731
- Try your best. - Are you ready?

234
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,061
Set,

235
00:09:31,061 --> 00:09:32,101
(Nerve-racking)

236
00:09:32,731 --> 00:09:34,861
- Set, Go! - I'm nervous.

237
00:09:35,431 --> 00:09:39,401
Hello,

238
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:42,231
My name is...

239
00:09:42,231 --> 00:09:45,861
Kang Gary.

240
00:09:45,861 --> 00:09:48,461
- You're going too slow. - You'll have plenty of time.

241
00:09:48,931 --> 00:09:50,601
60 seconds is longer than you think.

242
00:09:52,201 --> 00:09:54,501
- Hello, I'm Lee Kwang Soo. - He's going too fast.

243
00:09:54,701 --> 00:09:56,831
- The weather's nice out today. - Five.

244
00:09:56,831 --> 00:09:58,761
- Everyone, - Six.

245
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,001
- don't catch a cold. - You're taking long.

246
00:10:02,231 --> 00:10:03,461
(They feel like the bomb will go off any second now.)

247
00:10:03,461 --> 00:10:06,131
Hello, everyone. I'm Haha.

248
00:10:06,131 --> 00:10:07,431
(They're getting nervous.)

249
00:10:07,431 --> 00:10:10,001
It's a field day today.

250
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:12,761
Stay safe, everyone.

251
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:14,561
Please root for our team.

252
00:10:14,561 --> 00:10:16,701
Let's go, Men's Team!

253
00:10:16,761 --> 00:10:18,601
(What do you mean, "Let's go"?)

254
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:20,301
He took so long. It's going to blow up on you.

255
00:10:20,301 --> 00:10:21,561
He used too much time.

256
00:10:21,561 --> 00:10:23,561
I made a debut as a singer.

257
00:10:23,961 --> 00:10:28,461
(He manages to sing in a tight situation like this.)

258
00:10:28,601 --> 00:10:30,461
I was the best ballad singer.

259
00:10:30,461 --> 00:10:31,671
Give it to me.

260
00:10:32,061 --> 00:10:35,561
I made a debut as Turbo. I've been in the industry for 21 years.

261
00:10:35,561 --> 00:10:37,831
I'll continue to make more appearances. I'm Kim Jong Kook.

262
00:10:37,831 --> 00:10:39,231
He's out of time.

263
00:10:39,701 --> 00:10:40,731
Stay healthy, everyone.

264
00:10:40,731 --> 00:10:41,801
Oh, no.

265
00:10:41,801 --> 00:10:44,301
The time's up.

266
00:10:44,301 --> 00:10:46,901
- Go really fast. - Hello, I'm Park Mi Sun.

267
00:10:47,061 --> 00:10:48,261
(The bomb goes off.)

268
00:10:48,261 --> 00:10:50,231
(It blew up as soon as she got her hands on it.)

269
00:10:50,231 --> 00:10:52,001
(The other team looks startled.)

270
00:10:52,531 --> 00:10:53,861
Why did you all take so long?

271
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,661
- We didn't take long. - I didn't even get to say anything.

272
00:10:55,661 --> 00:10:57,831
- We still had a few seconds left. - It blew up on me.

273
00:10:57,831 --> 00:10:59,361
We had so much time left.

274
00:10:59,361 --> 00:11:01,261
- We counted it ourselves. - Gosh.

275
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:03,661
- Are you serious? - It scared me so much.

276
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:05,331
(Spy Mi Sun's acting is spot on.)

277
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,631
We were off by three seconds.

278
00:11:07,061 --> 00:11:08,831
- Let's give it a try. - They won't be able to do it.

279
00:11:08,831 --> 00:11:10,061
I'm scared.

280
00:11:10,101 --> 00:11:12,601
- Let's go! - Let's go!

281
00:11:13,331 --> 00:11:14,561
Set, go!

282
00:11:15,161 --> 00:11:17,331
Hello, I'm Yu Jae Seok.

283
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:20,331
I made a debut on 1991 College Comedy Festival.

284
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:22,701
- Why are you using up so much time? - I'm on Running Man right now.

285
00:11:22,701 --> 00:11:24,331
- I'm on Running Man right now. - Pass it on.

286
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:27,361
Hello, I'm Kang Min Kyung of Davichi.

287
00:11:27,501 --> 00:11:29,161
We are back with a new album.

288
00:11:29,161 --> 00:11:32,531
- I think of you everyday - Pass it down.

289
00:11:32,601 --> 00:11:35,961
Hello, I'm the rhythmic gymnast, Son Yeon Jae.

290
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:37,301
She doesn't look scared at all.

291
00:11:38,261 --> 00:11:40,001
Thanks for having me today.

292
00:11:40,001 --> 00:11:41,461
- What should I do with this? - Pass it on.

293
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:43,031
Hello, I'm actress Ye Ji Won.

294
00:11:43,031 --> 00:11:45,461
I came to see Jae Seok today.

295
00:11:45,461 --> 00:11:48,631
It's nice to see you, Jong Kook. I'm doing a drama with Ji Hyo.

296
00:11:48,631 --> 00:11:51,001
Hello, I'm Yu Ra of Girl's Day. Nice to meet you.

297
00:11:51,101 --> 00:11:53,531
You have to go faster. Go faster.

298
00:11:53,761 --> 00:11:56,361
- Go faster. - Thank you. I love you.

299
00:11:56,361 --> 00:11:58,131
- Don't yell out to stop yet. - Hello, Song Ji Hyo.

300
00:11:58,131 --> 00:12:00,331
- Ji Hyo, don't stop yet. - Stop.

301
00:12:00,331 --> 00:12:01,761
- Stop. - You have so much time left.

302
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:04,801
Ji Hyo.

303
00:12:05,331 --> 00:12:06,431
(The bomb goes off.)

304
00:12:06,861 --> 00:12:10,601
- You used up 40 seconds. - I told you there's time left.

305
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:13,501
- It's only been 40 seconds? - Yes.

306
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:15,161
You had to pass it around.

307
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:16,831
I wasn't sure. I got it now.

308
00:12:16,831 --> 00:12:20,801
The second game is "Compliment the Opposing Team Leader".

309
00:12:20,901 --> 00:12:22,331
- I see. - But I have nothing to say.

310
00:12:22,331 --> 00:12:24,661
We're supposed to give that guy compliments?

311
00:12:26,161 --> 00:12:27,931
Ready, set, go!

312
00:12:28,261 --> 00:12:31,101
Jae Seok is the best show host Korea has ever seen.

313
00:12:31,831 --> 00:12:33,131
He can be a bit boring,

314
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:36,561
but I want to live his life for once.

315
00:12:36,601 --> 00:12:38,001
- Thank you. - You're the best.

316
00:12:38,401 --> 00:12:39,731
(Jong Kook is next.)

317
00:12:39,731 --> 00:12:42,261
Jae Seok is the best show host out there.

318
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,761
He's so smart and brags like there's no tomorrow.

319
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,761
What do you mean?

320
00:12:46,761 --> 00:12:48,961
- That's not true. - That's the person he is.

321
00:12:48,961 --> 00:12:50,601
Don't say it like that.

322
00:12:50,601 --> 00:12:51,901
Jae Seok is a good guy.

323
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:54,531
It's irritating to have him around.

324
00:12:55,501 --> 00:12:56,901
He makes me look bad.

325
00:12:57,631 --> 00:13:00,601
He's such a role model.

326
00:13:00,601 --> 00:13:03,231
He can be so stubborn sometimes. I'm so sick of him.

327
00:13:03,231 --> 00:13:05,161
I feel like I'm standing on a cliff.

328
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:07,161
- Be careful. - Use your time wisely.

329
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,301
Jae Seok is...

330
00:13:08,401 --> 00:13:09,731
ugly but nice.

331
00:13:09,731 --> 00:13:12,901
(Jae Seok is ugly but nice.)

332
00:13:13,131 --> 00:13:14,861
Ugly people are usually nice.

333
00:13:15,101 --> 00:13:16,261
Pass it on.

334
00:13:16,261 --> 00:13:17,701
- You still have some time left. - Stop.

335
00:13:17,701 --> 00:13:18,961
(Stop.)

336
00:13:19,501 --> 00:13:23,761
(Gary yelled out stop as soon as he got handed the bomb.)

337
00:13:23,931 --> 00:13:25,101
Did we do it?

338
00:13:25,561 --> 00:13:27,631
- I won't tell you the record yet. - That's fine.

339
00:13:27,801 --> 00:13:29,531
- It was successful, then. - It didn't go off.

340
00:13:29,531 --> 00:13:31,161
- I think it was a bit early. - At least the bomb didn't go off.

341
00:13:31,161 --> 00:13:34,001
Keep in mind that we only used 40 second with the last attempt.

342
00:13:34,261 --> 00:13:37,801
You should talk more, Ji Hyo. Let's go again like last time.

343
00:13:38,201 --> 00:13:41,061
Are we supposed to compliment Mi Sun?

344
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:43,001
You must have so much to talk about.

345
00:13:43,001 --> 00:13:44,231
They'll go on forever.

346
00:13:44,361 --> 00:13:46,431
- That's right. - Ready, set, go!

347
00:13:46,661 --> 00:13:51,361
Mi Sun is a good role model to young comedians.

348
00:13:51,361 --> 00:13:53,431
- I'll start counting. - She taught us...

349
00:13:53,431 --> 00:13:57,131
many lessons regarding marriage.

350
00:13:57,131 --> 00:13:58,161
Did they start?

351
00:13:58,161 --> 00:14:00,031
- She's a great role model... - Did they start?

352
00:14:00,031 --> 00:14:01,861
who shows how to have a good marriage.

353
00:14:01,861 --> 00:14:05,131
- You are showing how to love... - You're speaking for too long.

354
00:14:05,131 --> 00:14:06,431
That's what I think about her.

355
00:14:06,431 --> 00:14:07,761
- Take the ball from him. - What was her nickname?

356
00:14:07,861 --> 00:14:11,161
- Come on. - Mi Sun is really beautiful.

357
00:14:11,231 --> 00:14:16,361
She's also known for her vitality. And she even has abs.

358
00:14:16,361 --> 00:14:19,201
- Really? - I admire and respect her.

359
00:14:19,761 --> 00:14:22,231
- Aren't they running out of time? - She was the host...

360
00:14:22,231 --> 00:14:25,501
of my first show. She was so kind and considerate.

361
00:14:25,561 --> 00:14:27,701
It was great to meet her there.

362
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:31,461
I'm Mi Sun's fan. I admire her beauty and intelligence.

363
00:14:31,461 --> 00:14:33,901
Why don't you give Miss Korea a try?

364
00:14:33,901 --> 00:14:35,861
Please show us how beautiful you are in a swimsuit.

365
00:14:35,901 --> 00:14:38,601
You look so young and beautiful.

366
00:14:38,601 --> 00:14:41,801
Thank you for being kind every time we meet.

367
00:14:41,831 --> 00:14:43,231
I love you.

368
00:14:43,231 --> 00:14:45,661
Mi Sun, I admire your consistency...

369
00:14:45,661 --> 00:14:46,731
(The ball pops.)

370
00:14:47,231 --> 00:14:48,531
We failed again.

371
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:51,731
(The ball explodes in Ji Hyo's hands again.)

372
00:14:51,731 --> 00:14:53,901
- Gosh. - Ji Hyo, you're not concentrating.

373
00:14:53,901 --> 00:14:56,531
- It exploded as soon as I got it. - Yes. It exploded right away.

374
00:14:56,531 --> 00:14:58,601
The ball exploded in your hands two times in a row.

375
00:14:58,601 --> 00:15:00,431
- It exploded as soon as she got it. - I couldn't do anything.

376
00:15:00,431 --> 00:15:01,431
(You could've done better.)

377
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,801
Jae Seok, you spoke for too long.

378
00:15:03,801 --> 00:15:06,861
- That's all right - That's all right

379
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:10,231
Ding-a-ling, tring-a-ling, you've got a call

380
00:15:10,231 --> 00:15:13,261
The person on the call said Men's Team has won

381
00:15:13,331 --> 00:15:16,261
- No, no, it's a lie - No, no, it's a lie

382
00:15:16,261 --> 00:15:19,161
The person on the call said Women's Team has won

383
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:22,061
- No, no, it's a lie - No, no, it's a lie

384
00:15:22,061 --> 00:15:25,061
The person on the call said Men's Team has won

385
00:15:25,331 --> 00:15:27,531
- No, no, it's a lie - No, no, it's a lie

386
00:15:28,201 --> 00:15:30,531
(Their cheering never stops.)

387
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:32,901
(You can't beat us.)

388
00:15:34,131 --> 00:15:38,531
The person on the call said Men's Team has won

389
00:15:38,531 --> 00:15:39,801
(All right. We lost.)

390
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:40,831
They ended the song.

391
00:15:40,831 --> 00:15:42,431
- We won the game. - Yes, we won.

392
00:15:42,461 --> 00:15:43,461
(That was really childish.)

393
00:15:44,061 --> 00:15:45,061
That was a great ending.

394
00:15:45,231 --> 00:15:46,531
All right. Rip one of the strips.

395
00:15:46,531 --> 00:15:48,501
- Let's rip off number three. - Isn't number two a better choice?

396
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:50,261
- Okay. Let's take number two. - Number two?

397
00:15:50,361 --> 00:15:52,261
We don't know which side of the face it'll show.

398
00:15:52,261 --> 00:15:54,231
- That's right. We don't know. - It's the eyes.

399
00:15:54,761 --> 00:15:57,531
(These eyes look familiar.)

400
00:15:58,401 --> 00:15:59,431
Isn't she Uhm Jung Hwa?

401
00:16:00,261 --> 00:16:01,561
Yes. I think so, too.

402
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,301
Doesn't she look like Uhm Jung Hwa?

403
00:16:04,261 --> 00:16:05,431
- I think she's Kim Hee Seon. - All right.

404
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:08,261
- One, two, three. - She's Kim Hee Seon.

405
00:16:08,261 --> 00:16:10,701
- Five, four, three, - I think she's Uhm Jung Hwa.

406
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:13,231
- two... - All right. One, two, three.

407
00:16:13,231 --> 00:16:14,431
- Kim Hee Seon. - Kim Hee Seon.

408
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:16,261
(Men's Team's answer is Kim Hee Seon.)

409
00:16:16,261 --> 00:16:20,601
(Can they guess who she is only with her eyes?)

410
00:16:20,901 --> 00:16:22,061
- She's not. - It's wrong.

411
00:16:22,061 --> 00:16:23,061
I think she's Uhm Jung Hwa.

412
00:16:23,061 --> 00:16:24,531
We must win this game.

413
00:16:24,561 --> 00:16:26,201
We must win this time.

414
00:16:26,431 --> 00:16:28,061
They can guess who she is next time.

415
00:16:28,761 --> 00:16:31,161
The next game is "Pass on the Word".

416
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:33,661
("Pass on the Word")

417
00:16:34,231 --> 00:16:36,431
Everybody must wear a pair of headphones...

418
00:16:36,461 --> 00:16:39,161
and deliver what the person in front of you says.

419
00:16:39,261 --> 00:16:40,601
This is really fun.

420
00:16:40,661 --> 00:16:42,961
You will receive a point if the last person guesses the correct answer.

421
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:46,261
- What a classic game it is. - Yes, it's a famous team game.

422
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:49,261
It won't be easy to win any points. Not even one.

423
00:16:49,261 --> 00:16:51,731
You're right. Shall we begin with Women's Team?

424
00:16:51,731 --> 00:16:53,031
- Yes. - Okay.

425
00:16:55,531 --> 00:16:58,661
Ready? Set. Start.

426
00:16:58,861 --> 00:17:00,031
(Americano)

427
00:17:00,031 --> 00:17:01,261
That's too easy.

428
00:17:02,031 --> 00:17:04,701
Americano.

429
00:17:06,761 --> 00:17:09,201
Americano.

430
00:17:09,371 --> 00:17:10,661
(They're doing great so far.)

431
00:17:10,661 --> 00:17:11,701
(How would Jae Seok perform?)

432
00:17:11,701 --> 00:17:13,231
Americano.

433
00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:15,531
(Thanks to the easy word, Jae Seok succeeds too.)

434
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,261
Americano.

435
00:17:18,731 --> 00:17:20,261
Americano.

436
00:17:21,231 --> 00:17:23,731
Americano. Is it correct?

437
00:17:24,801 --> 00:17:25,801
(Pickled chili)

438
00:17:26,931 --> 00:17:30,031
Pickled chili.

439
00:17:34,331 --> 00:17:37,761
Puppy chili.

440
00:17:38,231 --> 00:17:40,871
(Puppy chili?)

441
00:17:41,431 --> 00:17:43,561
(What kind of chili is that?)

442
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:45,061
- Hey. - Okay.

443
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,261
Pickled chili.

444
00:17:47,261 --> 00:17:49,461
(Somehow, Jae Seok says the correct answer.)

445
00:17:50,201 --> 00:17:52,001
Gangster chili.

446
00:17:52,001 --> 00:17:53,531
(Gangster chili?)

447
00:17:54,371 --> 00:17:55,761
(What is a gangster chili?)

448
00:17:55,761 --> 00:17:57,331
- What did she say? - She said, "gangster chili".

449
00:17:57,331 --> 00:17:59,701
(That gangster must be quite hot.)

450
00:18:00,561 --> 00:18:02,461
Pickled chili.

451
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:06,631
Pickled chili. Am I correct?

452
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:07,831
(That's correct.)

453
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:08,961
(Baechu geotjeori)

454
00:18:09,561 --> 00:18:10,561
(This one is really difficult.)

455
00:18:10,561 --> 00:18:13,501
Baechu geotjeori.

456
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:19,161
Baechu geotjeori.

457
00:18:19,161 --> 00:18:20,761
(Min Kyung is correct this time.)

458
00:18:21,871 --> 00:18:23,731
Baechu geotjeori.

459
00:18:23,931 --> 00:18:25,731
(They are doing fine so far.)

460
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:27,801
(What kind of strange things will Ji Hyo say this time?)

461
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:31,931
Something... Something really spicy?

462
00:18:32,961 --> 00:18:36,161
- Isn't she the spy? - She must be the spy.

463
00:18:36,161 --> 00:18:37,501
Something really spicy.

464
00:18:37,501 --> 00:18:38,501
(Wrong)

465
00:18:38,631 --> 00:18:40,601
Time out.

466
00:18:40,601 --> 00:18:42,001
Women's Team got two points.

467
00:18:42,001 --> 00:18:43,061
Really?

468
00:18:43,061 --> 00:18:44,431
Hey, Ji Hyo.

469
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:46,261
Can you please tell us what "gangster chili" is?

470
00:18:46,761 --> 00:18:48,061
What is it?

471
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:50,431
- Do you know what it is? - It's my first time hearing.

472
00:18:50,431 --> 00:18:52,871
- What is "gangster chili"? - She's suspicious.

473
00:18:53,061 --> 00:18:55,331
(Is Ji Hyo really the spy?)

474
00:18:59,331 --> 00:19:00,331
Are you ready?

475
00:19:00,331 --> 00:19:01,601
(Can Men's Team win the second round, too?)

476
00:19:01,601 --> 00:19:03,531
Set, start.

477
00:19:03,801 --> 00:19:04,831
(Telepathy)

478
00:19:06,461 --> 00:19:09,961
Telepathy.

479
00:19:09,961 --> 00:19:11,961
- All right. Next. - He must know this. It's so easy.

480
00:19:12,131 --> 00:19:14,331
- Telephony. - I knew it.

481
00:19:14,331 --> 00:19:15,731
(Telephony)

482
00:19:15,731 --> 00:19:19,031
- Look. He's really strange. - Something's wrong with him.

483
00:19:19,131 --> 00:19:21,631
- Telepathy. - That's right.

484
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:26,461
"Kkilkki ppappa".

485
00:19:27,061 --> 00:19:28,371
"Kkilkki ppappa"?

486
00:19:28,371 --> 00:19:29,561
(Where did kkilkki ppappa come from?)

487
00:19:29,561 --> 00:19:30,871
"Kkilkki ppappa".

488
00:19:30,871 --> 00:19:32,431
(They cannot recuperate.)

489
00:19:32,431 --> 00:19:33,871
- What's your answer? - Kkilkki ppappa.

490
00:19:34,461 --> 00:19:36,001
(How can "telepathy" be turned into "kkilkki ppappa"?)

491
00:19:36,001 --> 00:19:37,461
- Okay, I got it. - All right. Please begin.

492
00:19:38,101 --> 00:19:41,961
Hidden message.

493
00:19:42,761 --> 00:19:46,801
- Everybody must speak clearly... - Hidden message.

494
00:19:50,901 --> 00:19:52,901
Hidden message.

495
00:19:53,831 --> 00:19:55,761
Hidden message.

496
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,901
Mi Sun is suspicious, too.

497
00:19:58,001 --> 00:20:00,001
Twenty-four, seven.

498
00:20:00,731 --> 00:20:02,761
(Haha changes the word again.)

499
00:20:02,761 --> 00:20:05,061
- What's his problem? - That's so funny.

500
00:20:06,661 --> 00:20:08,301
Twenty-four, seven.

501
00:20:08,801 --> 00:20:09,931
Twenty-four, seven.

502
00:20:11,601 --> 00:20:14,161
That sounds really strange.

503
00:20:14,261 --> 00:20:16,001
- Is it over? - Wasn't it twenty-four, seven?

504
00:20:16,001 --> 00:20:17,871
- It was twenty-four, seven. - That was amazing.

505
00:20:17,871 --> 00:20:19,061
(There are spies everywhere.)

506
00:20:19,061 --> 00:20:21,761
Somebody changed "telepathy" to "telephony". Who was it?

507
00:20:21,761 --> 00:20:23,371
It wasn't me. It must be one of them.

508
00:20:23,371 --> 00:20:24,901
- Come on. Who was it? - It was me.

509
00:20:24,901 --> 00:20:28,061
- I said, "telephony". - Was it you?

510
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:31,231
- You're so strange. - It wasn't our fault.

511
00:20:31,261 --> 00:20:33,261
Mi Sun, you're suspicious, too.

512
00:20:33,261 --> 00:20:35,001
You spoke words too fast.

513
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:36,501
- What was the answer? - No, I didn't mean it.

514
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,531
- Hey. We... - That wasn't my fault.

515
00:20:38,961 --> 00:20:41,001
- Excuse me. We have to... - It was Kwang Soo.

516
00:20:41,001 --> 00:20:43,131
Stop bothering us! We're have a team meeting!

517
00:20:43,501 --> 00:20:45,061
You'd better stay away.

518
00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:47,601
- Calm down. - Stop bothering us.

519
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:48,901
Which sticker should we take off?

520
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:51,001
- Let's take off number two. - Yes. Number two.

521
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:52,901
- Let's see the eyes. - Yes. We should see the eyes first.

522
00:20:53,231 --> 00:20:54,531
We need to get some points.

523
00:20:55,601 --> 00:20:57,761
(Those eyes look very familiar.)

524
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:00,831
- I know who he is. - Who is that?

525
00:21:01,231 --> 00:21:03,301
- I know that person. - It's Ji Hyo.

526
00:21:03,501 --> 00:21:04,531
Isn't he Son Chang Min?

527
00:21:04,661 --> 00:21:06,601
- Mi Sun. Don't say it. - No, he's not.

528
00:21:07,901 --> 00:21:09,601
- It's not Son Chang Min. - I don't think so, either.

529
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,261
(Is he the Korean actor, Son Chang Min?)

530
00:21:11,731 --> 00:21:13,261
- Who is that? - Yes. Let's discuss.

531
00:21:14,061 --> 00:21:15,731
- Jackie Chan? - Yes. It's Jackie Chan.

532
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:17,331
- You're right. - Can I say the answer?

533
00:21:17,331 --> 00:21:18,531
Jackie Chan? Really?

534
00:21:18,531 --> 00:21:19,961
(Are those Jackie Chan's eyes?)

535
00:21:20,831 --> 00:21:23,061
- Jackie Chan. - I'm not so sure.

536
00:21:23,461 --> 00:21:25,731
- Jackie Chan. - Jackie Chan.

537
00:21:26,371 --> 00:21:32,701
(Women's Team calls out Jackie Chan. Are these Jackie Chan's eyes?)

538
00:21:32,701 --> 00:21:34,661
(They are correct.)

539
00:21:35,061 --> 00:21:37,061
(What a bummer.)

540
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:41,331
(Women's Team earns a great turnaround victory.)

541
00:21:41,331 --> 00:21:42,631
- We won. - Amazing.

542
00:21:43,431 --> 00:21:45,231
(Although he's laughing, Jae Seok must be crying inside.)

543
00:21:45,231 --> 00:21:48,061
- That was amazing. - How did you guess that?

544
00:21:48,061 --> 00:21:49,161
(Mi Sun fails to hide her laughter.)

545
00:21:49,701 --> 00:21:51,961
- She must be Jeon Do Yeon. - Isn't she?

546
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:54,361
- That's right. She's Jeon Do Yeon. - I couldn't even imagine.

547
00:21:54,361 --> 00:21:56,831
- Really? - Were her eyes that beautiful?

548
00:21:57,261 --> 00:21:59,761
- There he is. - He's Jackie Chan.

549
00:21:59,761 --> 00:22:02,001
- That's Jackie Chan. - How did she know?

550
00:22:02,001 --> 00:22:04,061
I thought it must be either Son Chang Min or Jackie Chan.

551
00:22:04,061 --> 00:22:05,731
I immediately knew it was Jackie Chan.

552
00:22:05,731 --> 00:22:07,861
- That was an amazing turnaround. - All right. So...

553
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:10,531
Women's Team has won the first game!

554
00:22:10,531 --> 00:22:11,761
(Women's Team wins.)

555
00:22:12,161 --> 00:22:13,231
That was amazing.

556
00:22:13,401 --> 00:22:16,761
It's about time for us to have a lunch break.

557
00:22:16,761 --> 00:22:19,131
Lunch break is the most important part of a field day.

558
00:22:19,261 --> 00:22:20,901
It's time for a lunch break.

559
00:22:20,901 --> 00:22:22,861
("Make Your Gimbap")

560
00:22:24,631 --> 00:22:27,861
All right. We're going to have gimbap for lunch.

561
00:22:27,861 --> 00:22:29,331
- Gimbap is a must-have item. - So today,

562
00:22:29,331 --> 00:22:31,561
we're going to make our own gimbap.

563
00:22:31,561 --> 00:22:33,131
Ingredients are hidden throughout this place.

564
00:22:33,131 --> 00:22:36,261
If you open a box, you must use that ingredient inside.

565
00:22:36,661 --> 00:22:39,261
You must find 10 ingredients and make your own gimbap.

566
00:22:39,261 --> 00:22:42,001
It's called "Make Your Gimbap". You must make your own gimbap.

567
00:22:42,001 --> 00:22:44,001
Can we not throw away some ingredients?

568
00:22:44,001 --> 00:22:45,061
No, you can't

569
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:46,431
All right, let's begin. Let's go.

570
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:49,161
(How would their gimbap look like in the end?)

571
00:22:49,961 --> 00:22:51,101
There's one.

572
00:22:51,861 --> 00:22:53,231
I found one, but...

573
00:22:53,561 --> 00:22:54,801
Just go and grab it.

574
00:22:54,801 --> 00:22:57,061
(They are trying to get the box.)

575
00:22:57,061 --> 00:22:58,431
(Seok Jin steals the box and runs away.)

576
00:22:58,431 --> 00:22:59,531
Don't worry. There's another one.

577
00:23:00,101 --> 00:23:02,761
(What's inside Seok Jin's box?)

578
00:23:02,761 --> 00:23:03,861
(Gummy worms)

579
00:23:03,861 --> 00:23:04,861
Oh my gosh.

580
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:07,331
There's one.

581
00:23:07,331 --> 00:23:08,631
(What will the others find?)

582
00:23:08,631 --> 00:23:09,661
I got one!

583
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:11,431
I got a box!

584
00:23:12,301 --> 00:23:13,331
There's one.

585
00:23:14,131 --> 00:23:15,631
I found another one, too.

586
00:23:18,261 --> 00:23:20,731
- What's inside? - How about yours?

587
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:23,201
- I think I have the worst one. - Me, too.

588
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:24,931
- I'm sure mine is worse. - Let me see.

589
00:23:25,061 --> 00:23:27,231
- What inside your box? Show me. - Oh, man.

590
00:23:28,201 --> 00:23:30,231
(They picked pickled shrimp and wasabi.)

591
00:23:30,231 --> 00:23:31,361
We got the worst.

592
00:23:31,361 --> 00:23:33,831
(Both of them are really unlucky.)

593
00:23:35,801 --> 00:23:36,831
Please...

594
00:23:37,861 --> 00:23:39,231
No! Raw garlic!

595
00:23:39,901 --> 00:23:41,561
This is the worst.

596
00:23:42,231 --> 00:23:43,601
(How is Women's Team doing?)

597
00:23:45,061 --> 00:23:46,101
I found one!

598
00:23:47,401 --> 00:23:48,561
Please. A good one.

599
00:23:48,731 --> 00:23:49,961
(Please...)

600
00:23:51,131 --> 00:23:53,801
Gosh. I'm so happy with mine.

601
00:23:53,801 --> 00:23:55,561
(She picked ham.)

602
00:23:56,361 --> 00:23:57,361
There's nothing here.

603
00:23:57,361 --> 00:23:58,461
We shouldn't go that way.

604
00:23:58,861 --> 00:24:00,931
- I found another. - There it is.

605
00:24:00,931 --> 00:24:02,061
(Min Kyung finds again.)

606
00:24:02,061 --> 00:24:03,601
I missed it.

607
00:24:03,601 --> 00:24:05,561
She found one more.

608
00:24:05,561 --> 00:24:07,461
- I don't know what's going on. - Why?

609
00:24:07,461 --> 00:24:10,461
This is crazy.

610
00:24:11,101 --> 00:24:12,831
(Eggs)

611
00:24:14,331 --> 00:24:16,331
Good job. Did you find one?

612
00:24:17,461 --> 00:24:19,431
- Will there be some here? - There may be.

613
00:24:19,431 --> 00:24:20,431
(Yu Ra and Yeon Jae are looking thoroughly.)

614
00:24:20,431 --> 00:24:21,561
- There is one. - Yeon Jae, Yeon Jae.

615
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:23,901
- You found one. - Can we open it?

616
00:24:23,901 --> 00:24:25,161
(What will there be?)

617
00:24:25,161 --> 00:24:26,831
- It's chicken feet. - Are you okay with them?

618
00:24:26,831 --> 00:24:29,061
- I love chicken feet. - Do you?

619
00:24:29,061 --> 00:24:30,631
We picked nice ones.

620
00:24:31,661 --> 00:24:33,761
(Women's Team acquired wasabi, eggs, spinach, skate, ham,)

621
00:24:33,761 --> 00:24:35,901
(garlic, strawberry jam, cilantro, Cheongyang chili and chicken feet.)

622
00:24:35,901 --> 00:24:37,961
(Men's Team acquired wasabi, pickled shrimp, gummy bear, strawberry jam,)

623
00:24:37,961 --> 00:24:40,031
(marshmallow, sesame oil, biscuit, Cheongyang chili, skate and eggs.)

624
00:24:40,901 --> 00:24:43,901
(They start to make gimbap with the ingredients for the field day.)

625
00:24:43,931 --> 00:24:45,861
May I put some spinach?

626
00:24:46,001 --> 00:24:47,931
Are you putting that much?

627
00:24:48,001 --> 00:24:49,931
Chicken feet gimbap looks delicious.

628
00:24:51,661 --> 00:24:53,131
Chicken feet gimbap.

629
00:24:53,131 --> 00:24:54,531
I want to roll it now.

630
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:57,001
This looks so delicious.

631
00:24:57,561 --> 00:25:01,231
(But something is strange.)

632
00:25:01,231 --> 00:25:03,061
- We can't put them all. - Wait a minute.

633
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:05,431
Let's put some gummy bears and marshmallow.

634
00:25:05,431 --> 00:25:07,561
- What about pickled shrimp? - And strawberry jam.

635
00:25:07,561 --> 00:25:08,801
Who's going to eat this?

636
00:25:09,131 --> 00:25:11,531
(Let me think.)

637
00:25:11,531 --> 00:25:13,261
I think we're giving it to the other team...

638
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,831
- That is possible. - so that they can eat.

639
00:25:15,831 --> 00:25:17,631
I think we have to exchange them.

640
00:25:18,361 --> 00:25:20,001
- That's possible. - Listen. It doesn't make sense.

641
00:25:20,001 --> 00:25:23,231
We could use just a little bit of skate for us.

642
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:25,861
You sound just like a spy.

643
00:25:26,431 --> 00:25:28,761
Hey, I'm not a spy.

644
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:30,261
(They keep suspecting each other.)

645
00:25:30,261 --> 00:25:31,931
(Something's fishy anyway.)

646
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,431
Let's make one gimbap for a penalty.

647
00:25:34,431 --> 00:25:36,061
Let's make one.

648
00:25:36,061 --> 00:25:38,401
Put wasabi here.

649
00:25:38,931 --> 00:25:40,431
That's a lot.

650
00:25:42,401 --> 00:25:43,431
My goodness.

651
00:25:43,861 --> 00:25:45,701
This is for a penalty.

652
00:25:45,701 --> 00:25:47,261
I see.

653
00:25:47,261 --> 00:25:48,401
This is too much.

654
00:25:48,801 --> 00:25:51,661
- I don't want to cut it. - I've never seen any gimbap...

655
00:25:51,661 --> 00:25:53,031
with skate and strawberry jam in it.

656
00:25:53,931 --> 00:25:56,001
(They put wasabi, skate and strawberry jam.)

657
00:25:56,001 --> 00:25:58,531
- And Cheongyang chili. - It'll be so spicy.

658
00:25:59,261 --> 00:26:00,801
I wonder who would eat this.

659
00:26:01,361 --> 00:26:04,731
- What are you doing? - I made a rice ball.

660
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:06,661
(You can make a rice ball with burst gimbap and cilantro.)

661
00:26:06,661 --> 00:26:08,501
It's Gagamel's rice ball.

662
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:10,931
(Who would eat this Gagamel's rice ball?)

663
00:26:11,801 --> 00:26:14,631
Cheongyang chili and jam makes such an odd combination.

664
00:26:14,631 --> 00:26:16,631
Skate and jam makes an even worse combination.

665
00:26:16,631 --> 00:26:18,531
- Don't you like it? - It's done.

666
00:26:19,501 --> 00:26:21,401
It's finished. Let's go out.

667
00:26:21,401 --> 00:26:23,261
- It's perfect. - This is great.

668
00:26:23,261 --> 00:26:24,961
We're all finished.

669
00:26:25,231 --> 00:26:29,231
(Is it true that they'll give them to the other team?)

670
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:32,161
- Did you all make gimbap? - Yes.

671
00:26:32,331 --> 00:26:34,501
In fact, fall makes people's heart...

672
00:26:34,501 --> 00:26:36,461
- pound. - You're right.

673
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:38,231
It's a good season to love.

674
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:41,061
Yeon Jae, do you feel melancholy in autumn?

675
00:26:41,661 --> 00:26:43,761
I feel that way in spring or in fall.

676
00:26:43,861 --> 00:26:45,601
- I want to meet someone. - Right.

677
00:26:45,601 --> 00:26:46,761
We're influenced by seasons.

678
00:26:46,761 --> 00:26:49,231
- Spring for women and fall for men. - But...

679
00:26:49,831 --> 00:26:51,931
I couldn't date because I had to practise.

680
00:26:51,931 --> 00:26:54,401
Since the Olympics is over now...

681
00:26:54,561 --> 00:26:55,801
Oh, really?

682
00:26:55,801 --> 00:26:57,131
(Then there's a chance.)

683
00:26:57,131 --> 00:26:58,201
Did you open your mind?

684
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:00,231
- Did you? - I want to meet someone.

685
00:27:00,231 --> 00:27:02,461
I want to meet someone.

686
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:04,731
- I'm surprised. - What kind of a man do you like?

687
00:27:04,731 --> 00:27:06,161
Tell us about your ideal type.

688
00:27:06,601 --> 00:27:08,231
I just...

689
00:27:08,231 --> 00:27:09,461
- Who, for example? - Is height important?

690
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,161
- I like tall guys. - She likes tall guys.

691
00:27:11,161 --> 00:27:13,301
- I like tall guys. - She likes tall guys.

692
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:14,861
Do you like tall guys?

693
00:27:14,861 --> 00:27:17,301
- I don't like a guy as tall as me. - But he's 2m tall.

694
00:27:17,301 --> 00:27:18,301
He's 2m tall.

695
00:27:18,301 --> 00:27:20,461
- What are you talking about? - He's still growing.

696
00:27:20,461 --> 00:27:22,461
Why do you say such absurd things?

697
00:27:22,461 --> 00:27:24,631
Don't do that.

698
00:27:24,631 --> 00:27:26,401
His nose gets longer and so do his ears.

699
00:27:26,431 --> 00:27:27,931
Kwang Soo is really...

700
00:27:27,931 --> 00:27:30,661
Why do you talk about me like that?

701
00:27:30,961 --> 00:27:33,201
He can't live without love.

702
00:27:33,201 --> 00:27:36,261
If you have to choose among us, whose appearance do you like?

703
00:27:36,261 --> 00:27:37,601
- Don't ask that. - Choose among you?

704
00:27:38,201 --> 00:27:39,501
(Choose among you?)

705
00:27:39,601 --> 00:27:41,031
Did you see Yeon Jae just now?

706
00:27:41,031 --> 00:27:42,601
"Choose among you?"

707
00:27:42,801 --> 00:27:44,261
This topic is now over.

708
00:27:44,261 --> 00:27:45,731
- You're not the one. - Because...

709
00:27:45,731 --> 00:27:47,261
Because we...

710
00:27:47,261 --> 00:27:48,761
You'll be the first one to get eliminated.

711
00:27:48,761 --> 00:27:50,761
There may be someone she likes.

712
00:27:50,761 --> 00:27:52,331
You're the second one to get eliminated.

713
00:27:52,331 --> 00:27:54,761
- You're done. - What's wrong with him today?

714
00:27:55,101 --> 00:27:56,831
You guys are all eliminated.

715
00:27:56,831 --> 00:27:58,631
(You're all eliminated.)

716
00:27:59,431 --> 00:28:00,961
Why did you point me twice?

717
00:28:00,961 --> 00:28:02,731
Why did you point me twice?

718
00:28:02,831 --> 00:28:04,631
- You're childish. - You are.

719
00:28:04,661 --> 00:28:06,531
Ask Yeon Jae directly and end it.

720
00:28:06,531 --> 00:28:07,931
Among you guys?

721
00:28:07,931 --> 00:28:10,461
- If you have to pick one. - According to the appearance?

722
00:28:10,461 --> 00:28:11,961
- According to the looks. - I would just...

723
00:28:13,061 --> 00:28:14,731
I want to meet someone.

724
00:28:14,731 --> 00:28:17,601
(All of them think they stand a chance if it is among themselves.)

725
00:28:17,601 --> 00:28:19,601
- Regardless of height. - I would just...

726
00:28:19,601 --> 00:28:21,231
choose Kwang Soo.

727
00:28:21,231 --> 00:28:22,801
I would choose Kwang Soo.

728
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,331
(If it's a dream, he may not want to wake up.)

729
00:28:24,331 --> 00:28:27,031
- She doesn't... - You don't care about appearance.

730
00:28:27,031 --> 00:28:28,961
- She doesn't care about the looks. - She doesn't.

731
00:28:28,961 --> 00:28:30,001
(Kwang Soo falls in love again.)

732
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:31,801
He really likes it.

733
00:28:31,961 --> 00:28:34,931
- Did you all make gimbap? - Yes.

734
00:28:34,931 --> 00:28:37,501
- We made terrific gimbap. - Yes.

735
00:28:37,561 --> 00:28:39,531
- It's eye-opening. - Yes.

736
00:28:39,561 --> 00:28:41,061
It is really eye-opening.

737
00:28:41,231 --> 00:28:42,931
- You have the worst gimbap, right? - Yes.

738
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:44,361
Let's exchange and eat them.

739
00:28:44,361 --> 00:28:45,631
Let's exchange and eat them.

740
00:28:45,631 --> 00:28:47,161
(Gosh)

741
00:28:47,901 --> 00:28:55,561
(I knew it. The ingredients were so suspicious.)

742
00:28:59,161 --> 00:29:01,801
- This is not edible. - Is this chocolate?

743
00:29:01,801 --> 00:29:04,731
- No, that is healthy gimbap. - There's chocolate.

744
00:29:04,731 --> 00:29:06,501
Please pick one to taste this.

745
00:29:06,631 --> 00:29:09,261
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Okay.

746
00:29:09,261 --> 00:29:12,001
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

747
00:29:12,331 --> 00:29:13,401
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

748
00:29:13,761 --> 00:29:15,801
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

749
00:29:16,061 --> 00:29:17,231
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

750
00:29:17,231 --> 00:29:19,501
(Yu Ra, Min Kyung and Jae Seok lost.)

751
00:29:21,601 --> 00:29:23,501
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

752
00:29:24,261 --> 00:29:26,331
(Yu Ra is chosen.)

753
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:28,231
- Okay. - Just try one piece.

754
00:29:28,231 --> 00:29:30,401
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

755
00:29:32,331 --> 00:29:33,731
(Kwang Soo is chosen.)

756
00:29:34,061 --> 00:29:35,931
(It's okay as long as it's not me.)

757
00:29:38,101 --> 00:29:40,131
- It's chocolate, right? - Just try it.

758
00:29:40,131 --> 00:29:41,201
- It's chocolate. - It is edible.

759
00:29:41,201 --> 00:29:43,431
- It doesn't look so bad. - It'll be delicious.

760
00:29:43,631 --> 00:29:47,031
- We made a great combination. - I'm nervous.

761
00:29:47,901 --> 00:29:49,701
That will be better than this.

762
00:29:50,861 --> 00:29:53,131
Good. Just don't breathe and swallow it.

763
00:29:53,731 --> 00:29:56,431
- Hold your nose. - Swallow quickly.

764
00:29:56,431 --> 00:29:58,701
(How will it taste when you eat skate and chocolate together?)

765
00:29:58,701 --> 00:30:01,101
(Laughing)

766
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:03,561
(There you go.)

767
00:30:03,561 --> 00:30:05,731
How does it taste? Please describe the taste.

768
00:30:06,031 --> 00:30:08,631
- How is it? - I tasted wasabi at first,

769
00:30:08,731 --> 00:30:11,631
- That doesn't sound bad. - but later it was all chocolate.

770
00:30:11,761 --> 00:30:15,301
We'll give Kwang Soo...

771
00:30:15,501 --> 00:30:17,131
something special.

772
00:30:17,531 --> 00:30:18,861
- A rice ball. - A rice ball.

773
00:30:18,861 --> 00:30:20,301
- Who made this? - What is this?

774
00:30:20,301 --> 00:30:22,001
- Was it a rice ball? - What's that?

775
00:30:22,431 --> 00:30:25,201
I thought it was something you threw away.

776
00:30:25,201 --> 00:30:27,401
The jungle expert made this.

777
00:30:27,401 --> 00:30:29,201
Cilantro keeps you away from mosquitoes.

778
00:30:29,201 --> 00:30:31,031
I'd rather get bitten by mosquitoes.

779
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:32,431
I'll feed you.

780
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:34,401
- Skate is not bad. - It's okay.

781
00:30:34,461 --> 00:30:36,631
It has all the healthy ingredients.

782
00:30:36,631 --> 00:30:38,061
Cut the cilantro off.

783
00:30:38,061 --> 00:30:39,931
He looks like a real giraffe with that.

784
00:30:40,831 --> 00:30:42,401
- A giraffe. - Exactly.

785
00:30:42,401 --> 00:30:44,331
He looks exactly like a giraffe.

786
00:30:47,761 --> 00:30:51,201
- The skate is... - All the taste kicks in now.

787
00:30:51,561 --> 00:30:53,531
The skate kicks in suddenly.

788
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:55,901
- You can do it. - It's not bad.

789
00:30:55,901 --> 00:30:58,331
- You can eat that. - Is it raw garlic?

790
00:30:58,831 --> 00:31:00,361
Is it raw garlic?

791
00:31:00,501 --> 00:31:02,501
Then you are tasting all the ingredients.

792
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:05,101
They even put raw garlic.

793
00:31:05,101 --> 00:31:07,631
He can taste all the ingredients.

794
00:31:07,631 --> 00:31:09,801
- Right. - Try other normal gimbap now.

795
00:31:10,561 --> 00:31:12,901
- This is... - Try this.

796
00:31:14,061 --> 00:31:15,661
- It's good. - It's delicious.

797
00:31:15,901 --> 00:31:17,531
This gimbap turned out great.

798
00:31:18,101 --> 00:31:19,831
- This is tasty. - It's really good.

799
00:31:19,831 --> 00:31:21,161
Come over here and try this.

800
00:31:22,931 --> 00:31:24,331
Is there a spy in our team?

801
00:31:24,501 --> 00:31:26,931
- I think there isn't. - Not at all.

802
00:31:26,931 --> 00:31:28,731
Sure, you would say so...

803
00:31:28,861 --> 00:31:29,961
because you're the spy.

804
00:31:29,961 --> 00:31:31,061
(You're the spy.)

805
00:31:31,231 --> 00:31:32,401
What's wrong with him?

806
00:31:32,401 --> 00:31:34,261
- You look like a spy to me, too. - I also think so.

807
00:31:34,261 --> 00:31:36,601
- I can see the spy in your team. - Who is it?

808
00:31:36,601 --> 00:31:37,961
Seok Jin.

809
00:31:38,801 --> 00:31:41,001
There are three in your team.

810
00:31:41,001 --> 00:31:42,701
Thank you for your attention.

811
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:45,631
Let me introduce the third Round of the field day.

812
00:31:45,631 --> 00:31:47,601
"Find Your Staff".

813
00:31:47,601 --> 00:31:49,361
("Find Your Staff")

814
00:31:49,731 --> 00:31:51,701
- What does that mean? - What's that?

815
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,031
- "Find Your Staff". - What's that?

816
00:31:53,031 --> 00:31:56,131
Each team will stand on each side.

817
00:31:56,131 --> 00:31:57,431
At the signal of a whistle,

818
00:31:57,531 --> 00:32:00,061
run towards the bar in the centre.

819
00:32:00,061 --> 00:32:02,331
Men's Team should check the blue bags...

820
00:32:02,331 --> 00:32:04,961
and Women's Team should look for the red bags.

821
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:07,831
There will be a note with a key word in each bag.

822
00:32:07,831 --> 00:32:10,061
Find a staff related to the key word...

823
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:13,101
and get verified at the front desk.

824
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:17,501
(Verified couples tie their bracelets together.)

825
00:32:17,731 --> 00:32:21,701
(You'll win if you remove all the bracelets of the other team.)

826
00:32:21,701 --> 00:32:24,631
If you don't find your staff, he or she will be eliminated.

827
00:32:25,231 --> 00:32:28,461
The bags of Men's Team is hanging high.

828
00:32:28,461 --> 00:32:29,861
- Yes. - It's not fair.

829
00:32:29,861 --> 00:32:32,031
Haha or Gary...

830
00:32:32,031 --> 00:32:33,461
(Haha or Gary...)

831
00:32:34,531 --> 00:32:36,861
Yeon Jae can jump higher than me.

832
00:32:37,031 --> 00:32:38,831
She can probably jump higher.

833
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:41,401
She can put her feet on my shoulder and tie her shoelaces.

834
00:32:41,401 --> 00:32:43,261
Try it. Can you do that?

835
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:45,901
- May I? - Go ahead. She puts it here.

836
00:32:45,901 --> 00:32:48,231
She can tie her shoelaces in this position.

837
00:32:48,231 --> 00:32:49,431
- Are you sure? - She puts it here.

838
00:32:49,431 --> 00:32:51,161
(She's so flexible.)

839
00:32:51,161 --> 00:32:53,161
She can tie her shoelaces in this position.

840
00:32:54,661 --> 00:32:57,161
(Let me try.)

841
00:32:57,161 --> 00:32:58,631
(He falls over.)

842
00:32:59,201 --> 00:33:01,201
(He seems to be kicked out.)

843
00:33:01,201 --> 00:33:02,831
- Gosh. - You're mean.

844
00:33:02,831 --> 00:33:04,461
- I wanted to help him. - Gosh.

845
00:33:04,461 --> 00:33:05,861
I just wanted to help him.

846
00:33:05,861 --> 00:33:08,131
- You're too harsh. - He could've been injured.

847
00:33:08,661 --> 00:33:09,731
I said I helped.

848
00:33:09,801 --> 00:33:11,731
I did.

849
00:33:11,731 --> 00:33:13,731
- Shall we start? - Yes.

850
00:33:13,931 --> 00:33:15,601
Let's put our hands together.

851
00:33:15,831 --> 00:33:17,231
- Upwards? - Downwards?

852
00:33:17,231 --> 00:33:19,961
In 1, 2, 3. Let's go.

853
00:33:20,461 --> 00:33:22,561
In 1, 2, 3. We can do it.

854
00:33:22,561 --> 00:33:25,001
- Let's help each other. - Okay.

855
00:33:25,001 --> 00:33:26,131
- Can I cut in? - We don't need to hurry.

856
00:33:26,131 --> 00:33:27,461
- Kwang Soo, help me please. - One bag per person?

857
00:33:27,461 --> 00:33:29,361
- We don't need to hurry at all. - Ready...

858
00:33:30,701 --> 00:33:34,531
(How will the spies act in this game?)

859
00:33:34,531 --> 00:33:35,861
Start.

860
00:33:35,861 --> 00:33:39,861
("Find Your Staff" has started.)

861
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,731
- It's okay. - Block them.

862
00:33:42,331 --> 00:33:43,731
- Block them. - It's okay.

863
00:33:43,931 --> 00:33:45,161
(They jump high.)

864
00:33:45,161 --> 00:33:46,661
- Oh my. - I can't.

865
00:33:47,061 --> 00:33:51,631
(Women's Team quickly gets all the bags.)

866
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:55,201
Did you take it at your first try?

867
00:33:55,231 --> 00:33:56,361
Please grab one for me.

868
00:33:56,361 --> 00:33:57,501
(Please grab one for me.)

869
00:33:57,861 --> 00:33:58,901
I can't reach.

870
00:33:59,361 --> 00:34:00,531
Go for it!

871
00:34:00,931 --> 00:34:03,061
- Lift me up. - In 1, 2, 3.

872
00:34:04,661 --> 00:34:06,001
- It's ticklish. - My goodness.

873
00:34:06,001 --> 00:34:07,531
- What should I do, then? - You're tickling me.

874
00:34:07,561 --> 00:34:09,031
One, two...

875
00:34:09,231 --> 00:34:10,631
Why are you so ticklish?

876
00:34:10,801 --> 00:34:12,031
It's too ticklish. I can't.

877
00:34:13,561 --> 00:34:15,231
(A man with strong arms.)

878
00:34:15,231 --> 00:34:16,631
Who is it?

879
00:34:17,961 --> 00:34:20,461
"A man who weighs over 100kg"?

880
00:34:20,531 --> 00:34:21,661
Gosh.

881
00:34:21,661 --> 00:34:22,701
What?

882
00:34:23,131 --> 00:34:24,771
There's no one who looks like a celebrity.

883
00:34:24,901 --> 00:34:26,331
- What's yours? - Mine?

884
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:27,861
Did you see anyone who looks like a celebrity?

885
00:34:27,861 --> 00:34:29,361
The youngest director?

886
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:31,231
"Someone who looks single"?

887
00:34:32,631 --> 00:34:34,001
A person who looks like a celebrity?

888
00:34:34,001 --> 00:34:36,531
(Their partners are revealed.)

889
00:34:36,561 --> 00:34:37,631
The youngest screen writer.

890
00:34:38,361 --> 00:34:42,561
(All the members now know who'll be their partner.)

891
00:34:43,461 --> 00:34:44,561
Let me see your hand.

892
00:34:45,201 --> 00:34:46,401
Yours is smaller than mine.

893
00:34:46,701 --> 00:34:48,031
My hands are pretty big.

894
00:34:48,361 --> 00:34:51,201
- Who looks like a celebrity? - How much do you weigh, Kwon Ryeol?

895
00:34:51,201 --> 00:34:53,061
- I don't see any here. - Tell me now.

896
00:34:53,331 --> 00:34:56,031
- Tell me how much you weigh. - Who looks like a celebrity?

897
00:34:56,601 --> 00:34:59,331
Double eyelids. No, it's nothing.

898
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:01,161
(She has to find a man with double eyelids.)

899
00:35:01,161 --> 00:35:02,301
I don't see any.

900
00:35:02,461 --> 00:35:04,201
Does anyone here think they're handsome?

901
00:35:04,931 --> 00:35:07,201
Are there any handsome guys?

902
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:09,661
Are you the youngest director? Who's the youngest one?

903
00:35:09,901 --> 00:35:10,931
The one who looks like...

904
00:35:10,931 --> 00:35:13,301
- Do you look like a celebrity? - It's you, right?

905
00:35:13,631 --> 00:35:14,961
- It's you, isn't it? - It's me.

906
00:35:14,961 --> 00:35:16,031
Let's hurry.

907
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,201
You're single, aren't you?

908
00:35:17,601 --> 00:35:18,831
Come here.

909
00:35:19,301 --> 00:35:20,961
You obviously look single.

910
00:35:21,901 --> 00:35:23,061
I brought the youngest writer.

911
00:35:23,301 --> 00:35:24,461
The youngest writer.

912
00:35:25,271 --> 00:35:26,431
- You got it right. - Okay!

913
00:35:27,401 --> 00:35:28,531
Sir.

914
00:35:28,531 --> 00:35:29,631
(She has to find a person with strong arms.)

915
00:35:29,631 --> 00:35:30,701
Sir.

916
00:35:31,061 --> 00:35:32,731
Sir.

917
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:34,561
Can I cling onto your arm for five seconds?

918
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:37,401
I'm heavy.

919
00:35:37,631 --> 00:35:38,731
In 1, 2, 3.

920
00:35:39,201 --> 00:35:42,031
One, two, three, four, five.

921
00:35:42,031 --> 00:35:44,131
I found him.

922
00:35:44,131 --> 00:35:45,661
(She found the right partner.)

923
00:35:46,331 --> 00:35:47,401
I found the youngest director.

924
00:35:47,701 --> 00:35:50,331
The youngest director? You brought the right one.

925
00:35:50,431 --> 00:35:51,861
Who is the handsome person?

926
00:35:52,031 --> 00:35:54,101
You must appoint someone else.

927
00:35:54,101 --> 00:35:57,131
This is ridiculous. He's not handsome.

928
00:35:57,131 --> 00:35:59,331
- I might look handsome to her. - We must be objective.

929
00:35:59,331 --> 00:36:01,001
It can't be subjective.

930
00:36:01,001 --> 00:36:03,361
- I found him. - No way, it's nonsense.

931
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,331
- This has to be objective. - I think...

932
00:36:05,401 --> 00:36:06,901
- we can make it. - Send him back!

933
00:36:06,901 --> 00:36:08,731
- My eyes look fine. - For this show,

934
00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:10,601
- we must send him back. - This part of my face is handsome.

935
00:36:10,731 --> 00:36:13,131
(Let me see how handsome you are.)

936
00:36:13,131 --> 00:36:14,931
My goodness.

937
00:36:16,831 --> 00:36:17,861
He's not handsome.

938
00:36:18,661 --> 00:36:21,931
(Ji Won and the handsome guy get bracelets.)

939
00:36:22,531 --> 00:36:25,001
How can everyone here not have double eyelids?

940
00:36:25,431 --> 00:36:26,931
Does anyone have double eyelids?

941
00:36:28,161 --> 00:36:29,431
There's no one.

942
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:32,131
- What happened? - No one has double eyelids here.

943
00:36:32,131 --> 00:36:33,301
Double eyelids...

944
00:36:33,301 --> 00:36:35,301
- Do you have double eyelids? - Gosh.

945
00:36:35,301 --> 00:36:37,161
- Wait a minute. - No one has double eyelids.

946
00:36:37,431 --> 00:36:38,931
- He doesn't... - Does anyone have double eyelids?

947
00:36:39,401 --> 00:36:40,771
- No one. - What about you?

948
00:36:41,001 --> 00:36:43,001
(Will Yeon Jae end up being alone?)

949
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:45,101
- Does anyone have double eyelids? - No one does.

950
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:47,231
- This is unbelievable. - How can there be no one?

951
00:36:47,231 --> 00:36:48,801
Do you have them?

952
00:36:49,461 --> 00:36:51,361
I think he does.

953
00:36:51,631 --> 00:36:53,331
He has double eyelids.

954
00:36:54,461 --> 00:36:56,131
He just follows you although he doesn't have any.

955
00:36:56,801 --> 00:36:59,271
You just follow her because it's Yeon Jae.

956
00:36:59,461 --> 00:37:00,531
Wait.

957
00:37:00,531 --> 00:37:02,401
Who looks like a celebrity?

958
00:37:02,771 --> 00:37:04,271
I don't know anyone who looks like a celebrity.

959
00:37:04,801 --> 00:37:06,731
No one looks like a celebrity here.

960
00:37:06,731 --> 00:37:09,401
(He looks like he's in a hurry,)

961
00:37:09,401 --> 00:37:15,331
(but he has been helping others until now.)

962
00:37:15,331 --> 00:37:21,801
(All that he's been doing was helping Women's Team.)

963
00:37:21,801 --> 00:37:22,961
(Men's Team, please keep up for me.)

964
00:37:22,961 --> 00:37:24,661
No one looks like a celebrity.

965
00:37:26,831 --> 00:37:29,401
Let's run. There are two more.

966
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,431
Jong Kook will come here soon.

967
00:37:32,661 --> 00:37:35,131
(Let's go catch Kwang Soo.)

968
00:37:35,771 --> 00:37:37,231
Jong Kook, put the bracelet on now!

969
00:37:39,031 --> 00:37:41,161
(Kwang Soo is in crisis.)

970
00:37:41,661 --> 00:37:42,801
Kwang Soo!

971
00:37:42,801 --> 00:37:44,061
(I'm coming!)

972
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:46,361
Kwang Soo! No way!

973
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:47,431
Stop!

974
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,061
(Kwang Soo struggles to fight two women.)

975
00:37:49,061 --> 00:37:50,201
(They rip his name tag.)

976
00:37:50,231 --> 00:37:51,271
I got it!

977
00:37:51,271 --> 00:37:52,661
(Kwang Soo is out!)

978
00:37:52,661 --> 00:37:54,901
No way!

979
00:37:54,901 --> 00:37:58,061
(Ji Won is very skilful.)

980
00:37:58,061 --> 00:37:59,861
My goodness.

981
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:03,331
(Ji Won finds Jong Kook distracted.)

982
00:38:03,331 --> 00:38:05,771
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

983
00:38:05,771 --> 00:38:07,101
(She removes Jong Kook's name tag.)

984
00:38:07,231 --> 00:38:08,271
(Jong Kook is eliminated.)

985
00:38:08,271 --> 00:38:09,361
I pulled it off!

986
00:38:09,361 --> 00:38:11,771
- I removed two name tags. - It's a double kill.

987
00:38:11,771 --> 00:38:14,161
(Ji Won succeeds in eliminating Kwang Soo and Jong Kook.)

988
00:38:14,901 --> 00:38:16,661
- Are you out? - Everyone is so sluggish.

989
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:18,731
- We all should exercise hard. - Right.

990
00:38:18,961 --> 00:38:21,461
Why are the staff so bad at running?

991
00:38:21,461 --> 00:38:23,731
Come to our gym and work out starting next week.

992
00:38:24,531 --> 00:38:25,661
- You need some exercise. - From next week.

993
00:38:26,561 --> 00:38:32,201
(Jong Kook and Kwang Soo are eliminated.)

994
00:38:32,931 --> 00:38:34,661
Cling onto his sleeve for five seconds.

995
00:38:34,661 --> 00:38:36,731
(Let's see if his arms are strong enough.)

996
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:37,931
- I'll start. - Start.

997
00:38:40,431 --> 00:38:43,501
- Gosh! We made it before! - Let's do it again.

998
00:38:43,501 --> 00:38:45,061
Have you yet to find your partner?

999
00:38:45,061 --> 00:38:47,701
I found him and I clung onto his arm for five seconds.

1000
00:38:47,801 --> 00:38:51,331
- And he failed this time? - Yes, he failed this time.

1001
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:54,231
- He's so mean. - I'm sure it was intentional.

1002
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:55,401
I'm so stressed out.

1003
00:38:55,401 --> 00:38:57,201
(Is it Jae Seok's scheme?)

1004
00:38:58,161 --> 00:38:59,301
Thank you.

1005
00:38:59,931 --> 00:39:02,031
Thank you. Please keep it a secret.

1006
00:39:03,201 --> 00:39:04,301
(What did you say?)

1007
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:06,461
Please don't turn away.

1008
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:08,361
You're not busy now.

1009
00:39:08,661 --> 00:39:11,131
- I should find a strong man. - I'm not strong.

1010
00:39:11,131 --> 00:39:13,461
I'll cling onto your arm.

1011
00:39:13,461 --> 00:39:17,231
Just drop me after two seconds.

1012
00:39:17,231 --> 00:39:18,731
I have weak arms.

1013
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:19,961
That's what I want.

1014
00:39:20,301 --> 00:39:22,031
Because I'm a spy.

1015
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:25,361
(She whispers to him that she's a spy.)

1016
00:39:25,361 --> 00:39:28,271
(Is Min Kyung really a spy?)

1017
00:39:29,531 --> 00:39:33,801
(3 hours ago)

1018
00:39:33,801 --> 00:39:37,631
You'll choose one of your teammates to be a fellow spy.

1019
00:39:37,631 --> 00:39:39,601
- A fellow spy? - Yes.

1020
00:39:40,401 --> 00:39:41,601
Whom should I pick?

1021
00:39:41,831 --> 00:39:47,201
(Whom has he chosen to be their fellow spies?)

1022
00:39:47,601 --> 00:39:49,331
I'll choose Min Kyung.

1023
00:39:50,431 --> 00:39:53,531
(He chose Min Kyung.)

1024
00:39:53,731 --> 00:39:59,231
Today, you're a spy of Men's Team.

1025
00:39:59,461 --> 00:40:00,771
- A spy? - Yes.

1026
00:40:00,771 --> 00:40:02,501
(Now, she's a spy of Men's Team.)

1027
00:40:03,961 --> 00:40:05,931
You'll have only one chance...

1028
00:40:05,931 --> 00:40:09,531
to betray your fellow spy and quit being a spy.

1029
00:40:09,531 --> 00:40:13,201
(She's given a chance to quit being a spy.)

1030
00:40:13,201 --> 00:40:15,901
Then I can choose either way.

1031
00:40:16,061 --> 00:40:18,601
But if you lose after betraying, you'll get harsher penalty.

1032
00:40:19,301 --> 00:40:21,331
My goodness.

1033
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:23,331
- Do you understand? - Yes, I do.

1034
00:40:23,331 --> 00:40:24,831
(If she doesn't win, she gets a penalty.)

1035
00:40:26,231 --> 00:40:30,931
(So she dragged on in the Arcade Games round...)

1036
00:40:30,931 --> 00:40:34,601
(and came up with a ridiculous answer.)

1037
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:42,401
(She even asked the staff to intentionally fail the mission.)

1038
00:40:42,631 --> 00:40:47,601
(Everything was a part of her scheme.)

1039
00:40:48,431 --> 00:40:49,601
Be careful.

1040
00:40:49,601 --> 00:40:51,631
(They'll participate in "Bracelet Battle".)

1041
00:40:51,631 --> 00:40:53,061
We must stay together.

1042
00:40:53,061 --> 00:40:54,061
Wait.

1043
00:40:56,131 --> 00:40:57,561
We must move together.

1044
00:40:58,401 --> 00:40:59,461
Be careful.

1045
00:40:59,561 --> 00:41:01,531
(Ji Hyo is out.)

1046
00:41:04,731 --> 00:41:05,771
It hurts.

1047
00:41:05,771 --> 00:41:07,661
(Ji Won grabs Gary's bracelet.)

1048
00:41:07,661 --> 00:41:09,031
(It breaks.)

1049
00:41:09,771 --> 00:41:11,361
(Gary is out.)

1050
00:41:11,361 --> 00:41:12,501
You did a great job.

1051
00:41:13,931 --> 00:41:15,101
Wait!

1052
00:41:16,901 --> 00:41:18,731
(Haha attacks Ji Won.)

1053
00:41:18,731 --> 00:41:19,801
I got it. Okay.

1054
00:41:20,001 --> 00:41:21,301
I made it. Are you okay?

1055
00:41:21,301 --> 00:41:22,831
(Ji Won is out.)

1056
00:41:22,831 --> 00:41:24,001
I shouldn't have put my guard down.

1057
00:41:25,631 --> 00:41:26,831
Wait a minute.

1058
00:41:26,831 --> 00:41:29,801
(Yu Ra is under attack by 2 members.)

1059
00:41:29,861 --> 00:41:31,831
- It's okay. - What's this?

1060
00:41:31,831 --> 00:41:32,831
(Yu Ra is out.)

1061
00:41:33,301 --> 00:41:34,901
Gosh, this is really hard.

1062
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:41,431
(Gary, Ji Won and Yu Ra are eliminated.)

1063
00:41:41,931 --> 00:41:43,431
- Thank you. - Now, go.

1064
00:41:43,431 --> 00:41:44,561
(Some haven't even started the battle.)

1065
00:41:44,561 --> 00:41:45,701
She looks like Sulli.

1066
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:47,631
- Sulli. - This is nonsense.

1067
00:41:47,901 --> 00:41:49,301
- She looks like Sulli. - Go bring someone else.

1068
00:41:49,301 --> 00:41:50,531
What are you talking about?

1069
00:41:50,531 --> 00:41:52,401
- She looks like Sulli. - Next!

1070
00:41:52,401 --> 00:41:54,161
- What do you mean, next? - The one with bigger hands.

1071
00:41:54,161 --> 00:41:55,301
Hey, Sulli!

1072
00:41:56,001 --> 00:41:57,771
She looks exactly like Sulli.

1073
00:41:57,771 --> 00:41:58,801
(We apologise to Sulli's fans.)

1074
00:41:58,801 --> 00:41:59,831
Goodness.

1075
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:02,201
This is ridiculous.

1076
00:42:02,201 --> 00:42:03,201
(Spy Jae Seok is doing a good job.)

1077
00:42:03,331 --> 00:42:04,631
(Min Kyung, I'm counting on you.)

1078
00:42:04,901 --> 00:42:07,161
- It's really unfavourable for us. - Wait.

1079
00:42:07,161 --> 00:42:08,931
(She's trying to make someone remove her bracelet.)

1080
00:42:09,101 --> 00:42:11,531
(Do not worry, Jae Seok.)

1081
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:14,601
You're so scary.

1082
00:42:14,601 --> 00:42:15,831
(She's acting.)

1083
00:42:15,831 --> 00:42:17,001
(Screaming)

1084
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:18,061
He's so strong.

1085
00:42:18,861 --> 00:42:22,271
(Spy Mi Sun and Spy Min Kyung are fighting.)

1086
00:42:22,301 --> 00:42:23,431
Hey!

1087
00:42:24,161 --> 00:42:25,601
(My goodness.)

1088
00:42:25,601 --> 00:42:27,801
(It got ripped.)

1089
00:42:27,801 --> 00:42:29,601
- It hurts. - Yeon Jae!

1090
00:42:32,001 --> 00:42:35,531
(Yeon Jae was watching for a good chance.)

1091
00:42:37,931 --> 00:42:40,031
(She made it.)

1092
00:42:40,771 --> 00:42:41,861
Yeon Jae!

1093
00:42:42,731 --> 00:42:43,831
Stop there!

1094
00:42:43,831 --> 00:42:45,861
(She's giggling.)

1095
00:42:46,031 --> 00:42:47,101
Yes!

1096
00:42:48,401 --> 00:42:51,101
(It's really chaotic here.)

1097
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:52,531
Please stop. No.

1098
00:42:52,531 --> 00:42:54,331
(No!)

1099
00:42:54,601 --> 00:42:57,361
(I can't win.)

1100
00:43:00,031 --> 00:43:02,731
(What?)

1101
00:43:02,731 --> 00:43:05,131
(Spy Mi Sun is out in an awkward way.)

1102
00:43:05,131 --> 00:43:06,301
Goodness.

1103
00:43:08,771 --> 00:43:09,931
(Someone grabs Haha.)

1104
00:43:11,001 --> 00:43:13,031
My goodness. You scared me.

1105
00:43:13,271 --> 00:43:15,931
(Min Kyung's partner is doing his best to win.)

1106
00:43:15,931 --> 00:43:17,031
Did we win?

1107
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:18,161
Goodness.

1108
00:43:18,631 --> 00:43:20,031
- Did we win? - He's too good at this.

1109
00:43:20,031 --> 00:43:22,101
- We won! - He's really strong.

1110
00:43:23,401 --> 00:43:25,961
- We won? - We won!

1111
00:43:25,961 --> 00:43:29,101
(Women's Team removed all the bracelets and won.)

1112
00:43:29,331 --> 00:43:31,431
(I'm doomed.)

1113
00:43:31,431 --> 00:43:32,831
Women's Team...

1114
00:43:32,831 --> 00:43:34,561
wins this round!

1115
00:43:34,561 --> 00:43:36,631
(It's 0 to 200.)

1116
00:43:37,961 --> 00:43:39,161
Gosh.

1117
00:43:39,161 --> 00:43:43,031
(Women's Team already earned 200 points.)

1118
00:43:43,031 --> 00:43:45,931
I think our team's spy...

1119
00:43:46,131 --> 00:43:48,331
- is really incompetent. - That's right.

1120
00:43:48,331 --> 00:43:51,161
- So... - We even said we didn't have one.

1121
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:53,061
(She remembers something.)

1122
00:43:53,061 --> 00:43:57,261
You're a spy for Men's Team,

1123
00:43:57,361 --> 00:44:03,061
but you get one chance to betray your teammate and quit being a spy.

1124
00:44:04,131 --> 00:44:06,361
(She gets one chance to join Women's Team.)

1125
00:44:06,361 --> 00:44:09,461
So I could join Women's Team...

1126
00:44:09,561 --> 00:44:12,561
if Men's Team doesn't look like winning. I get it.

1127
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:14,901
Yes.

1128
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:18,461
(Women's Team is leading by 200 points. What will Min Kyung do?)

1129
00:44:18,461 --> 00:44:20,501
Do you have a moment?

1130
00:44:20,501 --> 00:44:22,261
Ji Won is getting suspicious of me.

1131
00:44:22,431 --> 00:44:23,761
- This'll just raise more questions. - No.

1132
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:25,501
(Min Kyung calls over her fellow spy.)

1133
00:44:25,501 --> 00:44:28,531
Jae Seok, there's a mark that indicates I'm a spy on my back.

1134
00:44:29,601 --> 00:44:30,631
What are you doing?

1135
00:44:32,631 --> 00:44:34,231
The method is simple.

1136
00:44:34,361 --> 00:44:37,661
You need to take Jae Seok's name tag off and put it back on.

1137
00:44:37,661 --> 00:44:40,961
(You need to take Jae Seok's name tag off and put it back on.)

1138
00:44:43,701 --> 00:44:44,701
What are you doing?

1139
00:44:45,531 --> 00:44:49,031
(It's off.)

1140
00:44:49,031 --> 00:44:50,161
Hold on.

1141
00:44:50,161 --> 00:44:53,231
(It's back on.)

1142
00:44:53,231 --> 00:44:55,031
(Spy Min Kyung has successfully betrayed her team leader.)

1143
00:44:55,531 --> 00:44:58,761
The final race is always the highlight of a field day.

1144
00:44:58,761 --> 00:45:00,061
- Right. - It's the relay race.

1145
00:45:00,061 --> 00:45:01,601
The winner will get 200 points.

1146
00:45:02,101 --> 00:45:03,761
- Do we have 200 points? - Yes.

1147
00:45:03,761 --> 00:45:05,331
If we win, it's a tie, right?

1148
00:45:05,331 --> 00:45:07,761
It will be a tie and you can take the lead by winning the spy vote.

1149
00:45:07,761 --> 00:45:11,061
Men's Team is just doing bad regardless of the spies.

1150
00:45:11,061 --> 00:45:12,961
I think we're all spies here.

1151
00:45:12,961 --> 00:45:14,501
- They have at least three. - I think so, too.

1152
00:45:14,601 --> 00:45:16,801
We have too many spies here. They're so bad at the games.

1153
00:45:16,801 --> 00:45:18,501
People who aren't even spies are acting like one.

1154
00:45:18,501 --> 00:45:21,501
- We're just bad at these games. - I know.

1155
00:45:21,501 --> 00:45:23,261
- Are you a spy? - No.

1156
00:45:23,261 --> 00:45:24,831
- At least three of us are spies. - Never.

1157
00:45:24,861 --> 00:45:27,931
- Are you a spy? - You know I'm innocent.

1158
00:45:28,961 --> 00:45:31,361
- Are you a spy? - No, I'm not.

1159
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:32,531
He sounds like one.

1160
00:45:32,531 --> 00:45:34,761
Aren't you a smuggler?

1161
00:45:34,761 --> 00:45:37,661
- You're on the top of the list. - He's such a spy.

1162
00:45:37,661 --> 00:45:39,131
- He's a spy. - Did you see that?

1163
00:45:39,401 --> 00:45:40,401
The pupils were like this.

1164
00:45:40,401 --> 00:45:41,931
(Those were the eyes of a spy.)

1165
00:45:42,631 --> 00:45:44,431
(His pupils are dilated.)

1166
00:45:45,461 --> 00:45:47,801
I thought you were Lee Kyung Kyu for a second.

1167
00:45:47,801 --> 00:45:49,961
- His eyes were like this. - You found a talent.

1168
00:45:49,961 --> 00:45:51,161
He's definitely a spy.

1169
00:45:51,161 --> 00:45:54,461
- This is hilarious. - The real spy must be happy.

1170
00:45:54,601 --> 00:45:56,131
We have so many spies on our team.

1171
00:45:56,131 --> 00:45:57,561
(Who's the spy on Men's Team?)

1172
00:45:57,561 --> 00:46:00,061
If there's a spy on our team, she's doing a very poor job.

1173
00:46:00,061 --> 00:46:02,531
- She's a bad spy. - I'm sure it's Min Kyung.

1174
00:46:02,961 --> 00:46:06,331
Me? Why? I tried really hard.

1175
00:46:06,331 --> 00:46:07,931
It'll be shocking if you turned out to be a spy.

1176
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,031
I feel betrayed already.

1177
00:46:10,931 --> 00:46:11,961
Are you not?

1178
00:46:11,961 --> 00:46:14,131
(What will happen to the ex-spy who chose to betray?)

1179
00:46:14,931 --> 00:46:17,961
If you look at the front, you'll see the batons.

1180
00:46:17,961 --> 00:46:18,961
Okay.

1181
00:46:19,761 --> 00:46:21,031
- What's that? - Why is it so big?

1182
00:46:21,031 --> 00:46:24,061
- Are you sure it's not a pillow? - That's the baton?

1183
00:46:24,061 --> 00:46:26,601
(It's extra-large.)

1184
00:46:26,601 --> 00:46:28,631
(I'll give that to Men's Team.)

1185
00:46:29,231 --> 00:46:32,631
This might be unfair for Women's Team.

1186
00:46:34,161 --> 00:46:35,861
That would be a disadvantage to us.

1187
00:46:35,861 --> 00:46:37,061
It was an honest mistake.

1188
00:46:37,301 --> 00:46:40,131
- Are you kidding me? - It was a mistake.

1189
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:43,431
- Sorry, kid. - Don't call me that.

1190
00:46:47,161 --> 00:46:48,601
(I'm sorry, it was a mistake.)

1191
00:46:48,601 --> 00:46:50,961
- I can't beat him. - That's enough.

1192
00:46:50,961 --> 00:46:52,861
You tried.

1193
00:46:52,861 --> 00:46:54,131
(There's a reason why they made me the spy.)

1194
00:46:54,431 --> 00:46:56,131
You have to throw it further than you think.

1195
00:46:56,331 --> 00:46:57,861
We should most definitely win.

1196
00:46:57,961 --> 00:46:59,661
- Are you ready? - Go, Jong Kook.

1197
00:46:59,661 --> 00:47:02,531
You have to do good, Jong Kook. Prove us that you're not a spy.

1198
00:47:02,531 --> 00:47:03,531
I can do this.

1199
00:47:03,531 --> 00:47:05,131
(I'll prove it to you.)

1200
00:47:05,501 --> 00:47:06,531
(I have faith in you, Jong Kook.)

1201
00:47:06,531 --> 00:47:08,961
We'll be able to tell the spies from this.

1202
00:47:08,961 --> 00:47:09,961
Here I go.

1203
00:47:09,961 --> 00:47:13,601
(You won't be suspicious any more after this.)

1204
00:47:14,301 --> 00:47:15,761
Oh, my.

1205
00:47:15,761 --> 00:47:16,761
(I can't let them take the lead after I betrayed them.)

1206
00:47:19,201 --> 00:47:23,561
(It went beyond the line.)

1207
00:47:25,131 --> 00:47:26,431
I knew it. You're suspicious.

1208
00:47:26,431 --> 00:47:28,031
Are you really a spy?

1209
00:47:28,161 --> 00:47:29,761
Is he crazy?

1210
00:47:29,761 --> 00:47:31,701
(Keep it up.)

1211
00:47:32,301 --> 00:47:34,431
(Is Jong Kook really a spy?)

1212
00:47:34,731 --> 00:47:35,861
Ji Won, you can do it.

1213
00:47:35,861 --> 00:47:37,161
It's not about kicking it far away.

1214
00:47:37,161 --> 00:47:39,761
Don't let it go over the line.

1215
00:47:40,161 --> 00:47:42,031
- You have very small feet. - Yes, I do.

1216
00:47:43,161 --> 00:47:44,301
(Here it goes.)

1217
00:47:45,831 --> 00:47:49,661
(It's nowhere close, but it didn't go over the line.)

1218
00:47:49,661 --> 00:47:50,661
Okay.

1219
00:47:50,961 --> 00:47:52,131
- Did we win? - Good job.

1220
00:47:52,131 --> 00:47:54,431
Is it a 1 on 1 battle?

1221
00:47:54,431 --> 00:47:56,661
(Good job, team.)

1222
00:47:57,661 --> 00:47:58,801
- Can I go? - Let's see how Gary does.

1223
00:47:58,801 --> 00:48:00,031
(Gary's up next.)

1224
00:48:00,031 --> 00:48:01,461
- There you go. - That was good.

1225
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:02,831
He's leading the scoreboard so far.

1226
00:48:03,831 --> 00:48:04,861
(Yu Ra goes 4th.)

1227
00:48:04,861 --> 00:48:05,861
That's good.

1228
00:48:06,661 --> 00:48:10,661
(She takes the lead.)

1229
00:48:12,361 --> 00:48:14,361
Her shoe didn't roll.

1230
00:48:14,361 --> 00:48:16,261
(This is why I chose this team over Men's Team.)

1231
00:48:16,531 --> 00:48:18,161
- You can do it. - I think we got this.

1232
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:19,161
(Seok Jin's up next.)

1233
00:48:19,401 --> 00:48:20,601
It's looking good.

1234
00:48:20,601 --> 00:48:22,161
(I have my hopes on Seok Jin.)

1235
00:48:24,161 --> 00:48:26,761
(Seok Jin fails.)

1236
00:48:27,961 --> 00:48:29,431
(Is he a spy or is he just bad?)

1237
00:48:29,431 --> 00:48:32,361
- I slipped. - He's so bad.

1238
00:48:32,661 --> 00:48:35,261
(Everyone else did worse than Yu Ra.)

1239
00:48:36,531 --> 00:48:38,031
Why didn't hers roll over?

1240
00:48:38,031 --> 00:48:39,761
(Yu Ra of Women's Team is leading.)

1241
00:48:40,461 --> 00:48:42,761
- She's a spy. - No, I'm not.

1242
00:48:42,761 --> 00:48:44,661
I think Yeon Jae will shoot it high up.

1243
00:48:44,761 --> 00:48:46,531
I think it'll go backwards.

1244
00:48:46,531 --> 00:48:47,561
(Kwang Soo is up next for the losing team.)

1245
00:48:48,231 --> 00:48:50,031
You're so bad.

1246
00:48:50,031 --> 00:48:51,961
(They're taunting him.)

1247
00:48:51,961 --> 00:48:54,531
- You're so bad. - You're so bad.

1248
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:55,701
(I don't care if I'm the spy. I just want him to fail.)

1249
00:48:55,701 --> 00:48:57,301
- Cut that out. - Why?

1250
00:48:57,301 --> 00:48:59,061
- I can see you. - I'm getting ready for my turn.

1251
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,061
I'll give it a go.

1252
00:49:00,231 --> 00:49:01,801
(He's concentrating.)

1253
00:49:02,131 --> 00:49:03,161
You can't do it.

1254
00:49:03,161 --> 00:49:04,161
(I just want to disturb you.)

1255
00:49:04,161 --> 00:49:06,661
Just get it over with. We don't care.

1256
00:49:06,701 --> 00:49:09,101
- Don't look at me. - You won't be able to do it.

1257
00:49:09,331 --> 00:49:11,461
Gosh, you're bothering me.

1258
00:49:11,501 --> 00:49:13,401
Kwang Soo, you'll do very bad.

1259
00:49:13,401 --> 00:49:14,561
(They keep babbling on.)

1260
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:16,161
Here I go.

1261
00:49:17,431 --> 00:49:19,061
You're very tall.

1262
00:49:19,061 --> 00:49:21,231
(He turns his head away and shoots.)

1263
00:49:21,231 --> 00:49:22,361
That's good.

1264
00:49:22,361 --> 00:49:23,931
(How did he do?)

1265
00:49:25,131 --> 00:49:26,461
(Is this for real?)

1266
00:49:26,901 --> 00:49:28,061
- You're very tall. - That's good.

1267
00:49:28,061 --> 00:49:29,261
That's good.

1268
00:49:30,431 --> 00:49:32,401
(He rewrites the history of field days with that kick.)

1269
00:49:32,401 --> 00:49:33,601
Okay!

1270
00:49:33,761 --> 00:49:36,801
- That was amazing. - Good job.

1271
00:49:37,401 --> 00:49:39,431
(He is no longer the unlucky man.)

1272
00:49:40,361 --> 00:49:41,561
(Did that really just happen?)

1273
00:49:42,131 --> 00:49:43,861
- The game is over. - How are we supposed to beat that?

1274
00:49:43,861 --> 00:49:45,261
(Praise me.)

1275
00:49:45,261 --> 00:49:46,731
The game's over already.

1276
00:49:46,761 --> 00:49:49,461
(Men's Team will win at this rate.)

1277
00:49:49,461 --> 00:49:50,501
Yeon Jae.

1278
00:49:51,301 --> 00:49:54,561
(Kwang Soo is leading.)

1279
00:49:55,231 --> 00:49:57,001
- You did good. - You have to get it on the line.

1280
00:49:57,301 --> 00:49:59,061
(It's time to get back at him.)

1281
00:49:59,061 --> 00:50:01,031
Get back in the line.

1282
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:02,861
(I'm not going to try anyway.)

1283
00:50:02,861 --> 00:50:06,261
- What are you doing? - I'm practising.

1284
00:50:06,261 --> 00:50:07,531
(We can't let you off that easy.)

1285
00:50:07,961 --> 00:50:10,531
- Don't you lay your hands on me. - Okay.

1286
00:50:12,761 --> 00:50:14,231
(One, two, three.)

1287
00:50:14,231 --> 00:50:16,031
(Jae Seok gets kicked in the butt.)

1288
00:50:16,901 --> 00:50:19,661
(I'm your team leader!)

1289
00:50:19,661 --> 00:50:21,761
- I'm sorry. - You crossed the line there.

1290
00:50:21,761 --> 00:50:23,301
(How dare you abuse our team leader?)

1291
00:50:23,501 --> 00:50:25,761
- I'm sorry. - Isn't that a foul?

1292
00:50:25,761 --> 00:50:27,501
- He just kicked me. - The game hasn't' started yet.

1293
00:50:27,501 --> 00:50:29,131
(Do you have any idea how much I'm trying to make you win?)

1294
00:50:30,101 --> 00:50:34,201
- We have to look after our own. - That's right.

1295
00:50:34,301 --> 00:50:36,131
(The pink barricade goes up.)

1296
00:50:36,801 --> 00:50:38,861
It's been weeks since I had a good team.

1297
00:50:43,031 --> 00:50:46,131
(Are you that happy?)

1298
00:50:46,131 --> 00:50:48,701
- Good job. - Why'd you do that?

1299
00:50:48,701 --> 00:50:50,131
(Stop bothering our team leader.)

1300
00:50:51,301 --> 00:50:52,331
(Jae Seok and Yeon Jae are the only members left for Women's Team.)

1301
00:50:52,331 --> 00:50:53,631
- Good job. - I'm sorry, Jae Seok.

1302
00:50:54,401 --> 00:50:56,001
- You did very good. - Here it goes.

1303
00:50:56,361 --> 00:50:57,401
You're the best.

1304
00:50:57,401 --> 00:50:58,661
(I'll go easy at first.)

1305
00:51:01,331 --> 00:51:04,131
(It was a very good shot for a spy.)

1306
00:51:04,131 --> 00:51:05,861
- Is it over? - I should've done better.

1307
00:51:05,861 --> 00:51:06,861
We won.

1308
00:51:06,861 --> 00:51:09,031
(Yeon Jae is our only hope.)

1309
00:51:10,761 --> 00:51:12,261
Son Yeon Jae.

1310
00:51:12,261 --> 00:51:13,501
(Yeon Jae is the last person up for Women's Team.)

1311
00:51:13,531 --> 00:51:15,561
She wins if she gets it right on the line.

1312
00:51:15,561 --> 00:51:16,561
You're the best, Yeon Jae.

1313
00:51:19,001 --> 00:51:21,031
She was vibrant and strong.

1314
00:51:21,031 --> 00:51:22,401
(She's acrobatic, strong and has a sense of distance.)

1315
00:51:22,401 --> 00:51:24,161
She did good.

1316
00:51:24,701 --> 00:51:26,961
(Will Yeon Jae lead her team to victory?)

1317
00:51:26,961 --> 00:51:28,961
- Here I go. - Do it.

1318
00:51:31,931 --> 00:51:35,131
(She shoots.)

1319
00:51:36,101 --> 00:51:39,761
(I can't let her take back the lead.)

1320
00:51:42,861 --> 00:51:45,961
(She failed to take the lead.)

1321
00:51:45,961 --> 00:51:47,301
You came really close, though.

1322
00:51:47,301 --> 00:51:48,531
That was close.

1323
00:51:48,531 --> 00:51:50,161
She did really well.

1324
00:51:50,161 --> 00:51:52,531
(Maybe I shouldn't have betrayed.)

1325
00:51:53,161 --> 00:51:56,831
Women's Team gets the big baton and Men's Team gets the small one.

1326
00:51:57,901 --> 00:52:00,601
(Both spies had a tight strategic battle.)

1327
00:52:00,801 --> 00:52:03,431
(Min Kyung quit being a spy and betrayed Jae Seok.)

1328
00:52:03,431 --> 00:52:05,361
I think we're all spies here.

1329
00:52:05,361 --> 00:52:07,631
(Who's the last spy hidden among Men's Team?)

1330
00:52:07,861 --> 00:52:10,231
(Introducing the relay course)

1331
00:52:10,231 --> 00:52:12,961
(Step 1: Hurdling)

1332
00:52:13,231 --> 00:52:18,761
(Step 2: Roll the gym ball to the finishing line.)

1333
00:52:18,761 --> 00:52:22,761
(Spin 10 times holding your nose and cross the walk.)

1334
00:52:23,961 --> 00:52:27,131
(Step 3: Eat a caramel and whistle.)

1335
00:52:30,961 --> 00:52:33,661
(Step 4: Limbo)

1336
00:52:36,901 --> 00:52:39,631
(Step 5: Push face through plastic wrap and scream to 125 decibels.)

1337
00:52:40,331 --> 00:52:44,061
(Step 6: Roll the ball, tumble and catch.)

1338
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:50,961
(Step 7: Open the basket together.)

1339
00:52:50,961 --> 00:52:52,201
Who's going first?

1340
00:52:52,701 --> 00:52:54,461
- Okay. - I can't...

1341
00:52:54,761 --> 00:52:55,961
I can't do this.

1342
00:52:56,231 --> 00:52:57,401
Seok Jin is out.

1343
00:52:57,661 --> 00:52:59,831
I didn't know they would be that close to one another.

1344
00:53:00,201 --> 00:53:02,701
This looks hard. I had no idea.

1345
00:53:03,231 --> 00:53:05,361
(Mi Sun tries the plastic wrap course.)

1346
00:53:05,361 --> 00:53:07,861
(This is a bit embarrassing.)

1347
00:53:08,461 --> 00:53:10,401
I didn't know I have to push my face through plastic wrap.

1348
00:53:11,361 --> 00:53:12,561
Yu Ra, are you doing this as well?

1349
00:53:12,561 --> 00:53:14,501
(Should we just go back home?)

1350
00:53:14,731 --> 00:53:18,201
Mi Sun, I had no idea we have to do this.

1351
00:53:19,061 --> 00:53:20,931
This'll make us look terrible.

1352
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:22,231
I think I made the wrong decision.

1353
00:53:22,231 --> 00:53:24,461
- We made the wrong choice. - I didn't know we'd do this.

1354
00:53:24,461 --> 00:53:26,031
(Sorry, it's too late now.)

1355
00:53:27,261 --> 00:53:28,761
(Yeon Jae tries catching the ball.)

1356
00:53:28,761 --> 00:53:29,801
It hurts so much.

1357
00:53:30,161 --> 00:53:32,801
This isn't as easy as it looks.

1358
00:53:33,101 --> 00:53:35,501
(This is child's play to me.)

1359
00:53:37,301 --> 00:53:38,301
(She drops the ball.)

1360
00:53:39,061 --> 00:53:40,501
Can I catch it with my feet?

1361
00:53:40,531 --> 00:53:41,561
This isn't easy at all.

1362
00:53:41,961 --> 00:53:44,831
- It's harder this way. - I figured it out now.

1363
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:47,961
(In numerical order, it's hurdling, gym ball, caramel, limbo,)

1364
00:53:47,961 --> 00:53:49,861
(plastic wrap, rolling the ball and opening the basket.)

1365
00:53:50,361 --> 00:53:51,661
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1366
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:54,031
(This is their last chance to take the lead.)

1367
00:53:54,031 --> 00:53:56,931
(This is the chance for Men's Team to get even with Women's Team.)

1368
00:53:56,931 --> 00:53:59,831
(For Women's Team, it's a chance to win by 400 points.)

1369
00:54:00,261 --> 00:54:04,701
(Please don't make the betrayal and spying go to waste.)

1370
00:54:07,331 --> 00:54:08,801
("Relay Race" starts.)

1371
00:54:09,161 --> 00:54:11,431
(They charge towards the hurdles.)

1372
00:54:12,701 --> 00:54:13,931
(Hurdles fall.)

1373
00:54:15,431 --> 00:54:18,101
(Are they hurdles or dominoes?)

1374
00:54:18,101 --> 00:54:20,631
I'm in trouble. What should I do?

1375
00:54:20,631 --> 00:54:22,331
They all fell.

1376
00:54:22,461 --> 00:54:24,531
It must be harder than it seems.

1377
00:54:24,531 --> 00:54:25,801
(Everyone's watching.)

1378
00:54:25,801 --> 00:54:27,901
- What should I do? - They all fell.

1379
00:54:28,261 --> 00:54:29,531
Seok Jin!

1380
00:54:29,831 --> 00:54:32,431
- Seok Jin! Hurry! - Hey.

1381
00:54:32,931 --> 00:54:35,701
(Jae Seok is fulfilling his duties as a spy.)

1382
00:54:36,001 --> 00:54:37,761
I'm winning.

1383
00:54:37,761 --> 00:54:40,631
(The next runners came to watch.)

1384
00:54:41,331 --> 00:54:45,631
(Seok Jin is like a spy even though he's not.)

1385
00:54:45,631 --> 00:54:47,001
This is so annoying.

1386
00:54:47,001 --> 00:54:50,001
Is he a spy?

1387
00:54:50,201 --> 00:54:51,701
Are you a spy?

1388
00:54:52,631 --> 00:54:54,661
I didn't know it'd be this hard.

1389
00:54:55,031 --> 00:54:56,401
This is so annoying.

1390
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:58,301
This is really annoying.

1391
00:54:58,661 --> 00:55:01,261
- It's too slow. - Jae Seok is taking too long.

1392
00:55:01,261 --> 00:55:03,231
Is he a spy?

1393
00:55:03,431 --> 00:55:05,361
(Is our team leader a spy?)

1394
00:55:05,861 --> 00:55:07,361
When will they be finished?

1395
00:55:08,101 --> 00:55:09,601
This is so hard.

1396
00:55:09,601 --> 00:55:11,201
It's really hard.

1397
00:55:11,201 --> 00:55:13,661
I've never seen hurdles as timid as these.

1398
00:55:13,731 --> 00:55:15,361
What is this?

1399
00:55:15,361 --> 00:55:17,601
You're supposed to jump over hurdles.

1400
00:55:17,601 --> 00:55:20,001
- Are you a spy? - These hurdles...

1401
00:55:20,601 --> 00:55:22,501
(Suspicious)

1402
00:55:23,661 --> 00:55:27,361
(They're finally almost finished.)

1403
00:55:29,101 --> 00:55:32,031
(Seok Jin is a bit ahead.)

1404
00:55:32,301 --> 00:55:34,961
(I have to go faster than Kwang Soo.)

1405
00:55:35,161 --> 00:55:36,301
You got this!

1406
00:55:39,561 --> 00:55:41,401
Go!

1407
00:55:42,101 --> 00:55:43,161
Good!

1408
00:55:43,161 --> 00:55:44,201
(Men's Team is ahead in the 2nd part.)

1409
00:55:46,331 --> 00:55:49,161
(Stop there!)

1410
00:55:52,231 --> 00:55:54,501
(They arrived almost at the same time.)

1411
00:55:55,861 --> 00:55:59,331
(Jae Seok taking a long time on purpose.)

1412
00:55:59,401 --> 00:56:01,331
- Where's the zipper? - Open it!

1413
00:56:02,801 --> 00:56:04,401
Hurry out!

1414
00:56:07,331 --> 00:56:08,431
Come out.

1415
00:56:09,401 --> 00:56:11,401
You look like a goddess now.

1416
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:12,831
(Because of Jae Seok, the other team caught up.)

1417
00:56:12,831 --> 00:56:14,301
Turn 10 times.

1418
00:56:14,301 --> 00:56:15,401
Turn 10 times.

1419
00:56:15,601 --> 00:56:18,231
(She's very fast.)

1420
00:56:18,231 --> 00:56:19,631
Kwang Soo!

1421
00:56:19,631 --> 00:56:20,901
(You're doing great, Min Kyung.)

1422
00:56:21,531 --> 00:56:23,031
I'm really bad at this.

1423
00:56:23,301 --> 00:56:24,331
I can't do this.

1424
00:56:24,731 --> 00:56:26,631
You've turned 10 times.

1425
00:56:28,661 --> 00:56:29,701
Min Kyung.

1426
00:56:29,701 --> 00:56:32,531
(He seems drunk.)

1427
00:56:36,061 --> 00:56:37,101
(Everyone's watching this funny scene.)

1428
00:56:37,101 --> 00:56:40,061
- That's hilarious. - It looks so funny.

1429
00:56:40,261 --> 00:56:41,531
Go!

1430
00:56:43,931 --> 00:56:47,631
(There are drunk runners.)

1431
00:56:49,001 --> 00:56:51,131
(Kwang Soo puts one foot on.)

1432
00:56:51,201 --> 00:56:53,031
What should I do? I should go forward.

1433
00:56:53,031 --> 00:56:56,161
(She continues taking drunk steps.)

1434
00:56:56,501 --> 00:56:57,801
What will she do?

1435
00:56:58,031 --> 00:56:59,131
She can't walk.

1436
00:56:59,131 --> 00:57:00,901
She's almost as fast as Kwang Soo.

1437
00:57:00,901 --> 00:57:03,331
(She takes big steps.)

1438
00:57:05,001 --> 00:57:06,801
(Here we go.)

1439
00:57:11,101 --> 00:57:15,301
(They finished almost at the same time.)

1440
00:57:16,931 --> 00:57:19,731
(Eat a caramel and whistle)

1441
00:57:19,761 --> 00:57:20,961
What's that?

1442
00:57:20,961 --> 00:57:23,361
(Their face is covered with flour.)

1443
00:57:23,761 --> 00:57:25,001
My goodness.

1444
00:57:25,131 --> 00:57:26,231
What's that?

1445
00:57:28,001 --> 00:57:29,861
(He found it.)

1446
00:57:31,401 --> 00:57:33,031
- He found it. - Go on.

1447
00:57:33,031 --> 00:57:35,061
(They have to whistle after eating the caramel.)

1448
00:57:35,061 --> 00:57:36,501
- He found it. - Go on.

1449
00:57:37,201 --> 00:57:38,831
(Whistle now.)

1450
00:57:39,501 --> 00:57:41,501
(It's too chewy.)

1451
00:57:41,501 --> 00:57:43,301
You're almost done.

1452
00:57:43,561 --> 00:57:45,401
Let's do this!

1453
00:57:46,431 --> 00:57:48,101
You're almost there.

1454
00:57:48,801 --> 00:57:50,431
I can't whistle.

1455
00:57:50,631 --> 00:57:51,731
- There you go. - Yes!

1456
00:57:51,731 --> 00:57:53,131
(Haha charges towards the 4th section.)

1457
00:57:53,131 --> 00:57:54,501
Ji Hyo.

1458
00:57:55,101 --> 00:57:56,361
Ji Hyo.

1459
00:57:57,261 --> 00:57:59,501
- I can't whistle. - There you go.

1460
00:58:00,431 --> 00:58:02,431
(Ji Hyo is finally done.)

1461
00:58:02,431 --> 00:58:04,701
Ji Hyo, hurry.

1462
00:58:05,301 --> 00:58:06,931
- He passed it! - There you go!

1463
00:58:06,931 --> 00:58:08,061
(Gary passed the limbo stick at once.)

1464
00:58:08,061 --> 00:58:09,761
- He passed it! - Is it done?

1465
00:58:09,761 --> 00:58:12,761
- It's done! - Do the limbo!

1466
00:58:12,761 --> 00:58:14,001
Oh my.

1467
00:58:14,001 --> 00:58:15,761
(Men's Team's baton is handed over to a spy.)

1468
00:58:15,761 --> 00:58:17,961
- We should help her. - Mi Sun.

1469
00:58:18,001 --> 00:58:20,061
Go through it.

1470
00:58:20,761 --> 00:58:22,561
What should she do?

1471
00:58:22,561 --> 00:58:23,631
(Yu Ra, here I come.)

1472
00:58:23,631 --> 00:58:24,701
Yu Ra!

1473
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:29,161
- Hurry. - Do it.

1474
00:58:29,161 --> 00:58:31,561
(Yu Ra starts the 5th section.)

1475
00:58:32,501 --> 00:58:34,401
- Continue. - Hurry.

1476
00:58:36,261 --> 00:58:37,701
You have to continue.

1477
00:58:37,701 --> 00:58:40,131
(Mi Sun is taking a long time on purpose.)

1478
00:58:40,131 --> 00:58:41,601
You're almost there.

1479
00:58:41,861 --> 00:58:43,631
(They're fighting with their faces.)

1480
00:58:43,631 --> 00:58:45,131
- You're almost there. - I can't breathe.

1481
00:58:45,131 --> 00:58:46,461
Use the top of your head.

1482
00:58:46,461 --> 00:58:48,001
Use all your strength.

1483
00:58:48,361 --> 00:58:50,601
(A space monster)

1484
00:58:50,601 --> 00:58:52,161
Use the top of your head.

1485
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:53,561
- Use the top of your head. - You're almost there.

1486
00:58:53,761 --> 00:58:54,801
(Go through it, Yu Ra!)

1487
00:58:55,131 --> 00:58:57,501
- It's almost torn. - You're almost there.

1488
00:58:57,501 --> 00:58:58,961
- It's almost done. - You're almost there.

1489
00:58:58,961 --> 00:59:00,431
Please stop!

1490
00:59:00,701 --> 00:59:03,131
Why did you volunteer to do this?

1491
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:06,431
Please stop now.

1492
00:59:06,731 --> 00:59:09,031
Why did you want to do this?

1493
00:59:09,661 --> 00:59:11,961
Why did you volunteer?

1494
00:59:13,831 --> 00:59:16,901
You have nothing to lose.

1495
00:59:16,901 --> 00:59:18,101
(She looks like she has already lost everything.)

1496
00:59:18,101 --> 00:59:20,561
Hold the plastic wrap.

1497
00:59:20,701 --> 00:59:23,131
It's torn here.

1498
00:59:23,531 --> 00:59:25,361
- Hold the plastic. - There you go.

1499
00:59:25,361 --> 00:59:27,301
- There you go. - Yes!

1500
00:59:27,461 --> 00:59:28,531
It's done.

1501
00:59:29,301 --> 00:59:31,531
(She'll pass if she gets more than 125 decibels.)

1502
00:59:33,031 --> 00:59:34,401
(Yu Ra is done.)

1503
00:59:35,461 --> 00:59:37,631
Run!

1504
00:59:37,801 --> 00:59:39,801
My goodness.

1505
00:59:40,261 --> 00:59:43,231
- Hurry. - Stop, Mi Sun.

1506
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:45,501
It's torn here.

1507
00:59:45,501 --> 00:59:48,361
Come through here.

1508
00:59:48,761 --> 00:59:51,001
- There you go. - It's done.

1509
00:59:51,001 --> 00:59:52,301
Scream now.

1510
00:59:52,301 --> 00:59:53,331
(Screaming)

1511
00:59:53,401 --> 00:59:55,301
- Come nearer. - Come near.

1512
00:59:55,301 --> 00:59:57,161
- Come near. - Hurry!

1513
00:59:57,831 --> 01:00:00,631
- Please fail. - Yeon Jae.

1514
01:00:00,631 --> 01:00:03,731
(Yeon Jae throws her ball.)

1515
01:00:04,301 --> 01:00:07,261
- Please fail. - Yeon Jae.

1516
01:00:07,261 --> 01:00:12,501
(Now, she only needs to catch the ball.)

1517
01:00:14,001 --> 01:00:21,631
(I'll show you the beautiful moves from the competitions.)

1518
01:00:22,931 --> 01:00:25,331
(She caught the ball with her legs.)

1519
01:00:26,901 --> 01:00:28,231
You're supposed to catch it with your hands.

1520
01:00:28,901 --> 01:00:31,061
- Am I wrong? - With my hands?

1521
01:00:31,061 --> 01:00:33,431
- Catch it with your hands. - With my hands?

1522
01:00:33,431 --> 01:00:35,401
My goodness.

1523
01:00:35,501 --> 01:00:37,361
Come here.

1524
01:00:37,701 --> 01:00:40,361
(Mi Sun is still trying.)

1525
01:00:41,231 --> 01:00:42,861
(She failed again.)

1526
01:00:42,861 --> 01:00:44,131
Can I try again?

1527
01:00:44,131 --> 01:00:46,731
(Is she doing this on purpose?)

1528
01:00:47,731 --> 01:00:49,231
Can I try again?

1529
01:00:49,231 --> 01:00:50,401
(Yeon Jae, go ahead.)

1530
01:00:50,401 --> 01:00:51,761
With hands?

1531
01:00:52,361 --> 01:00:53,461
- Oh my. - Yes!

1532
01:00:53,701 --> 01:00:55,101
There you go.

1533
01:00:55,101 --> 01:00:57,061
(Yeon Jae succeeded.)

1534
01:00:57,501 --> 01:00:58,931
Good job!

1535
01:00:58,931 --> 01:01:00,161
(We still have a chance.)

1536
01:01:00,261 --> 01:01:02,501
(I don't think so.)

1537
01:01:02,901 --> 01:01:04,661
(Will Mi Sun fulfil her duties as a spy?)

1538
01:01:05,431 --> 01:01:07,261
- Good job! - Continue.

1539
01:01:07,631 --> 01:01:09,431
Hurry.

1540
01:01:09,431 --> 01:01:11,461
- Good job. - Hurry.

1541
01:01:11,561 --> 01:01:12,931
Our female warriors, good job.

1542
01:01:13,401 --> 01:01:16,861
Go ahead. You can hit me.

1543
01:01:17,231 --> 01:01:18,931
Hurry!

1544
01:01:19,031 --> 01:01:20,101
Come on!

1545
01:01:20,101 --> 01:01:22,631
Hurry!

1546
01:01:22,631 --> 01:01:24,801
- What should I do? - Ready.

1547
01:01:24,801 --> 01:01:26,401
One, two, three.

1548
01:01:27,401 --> 01:01:28,701
(Screaming)

1549
01:01:30,501 --> 01:01:32,831
(Her arm is twisted.)

1550
01:01:32,831 --> 01:01:34,501
(She was forced to succeed.)

1551
01:01:34,501 --> 01:01:36,961
Are you okay?

1552
01:01:36,961 --> 01:01:38,931
Are you okay? You're done.

1553
01:01:38,931 --> 01:01:40,761
Hurry!

1554
01:01:40,761 --> 01:01:41,861
Hurry!

1555
01:01:41,931 --> 01:01:43,401
- There you go. - Hurry!

1556
01:01:43,401 --> 01:01:46,261
Hit here.

1557
01:01:46,701 --> 01:01:48,561
(She's pretending she's running as fast as she can.)

1558
01:01:48,561 --> 01:01:50,001
Go.

1559
01:01:50,501 --> 01:01:51,761
Succeed at once.

1560
01:01:53,531 --> 01:01:54,761
- There you go. - There you go.

1561
01:01:54,761 --> 01:01:56,761
(Jong Kook succeeds at once.)

1562
01:01:57,301 --> 01:01:58,901
- Hurry. - I think it'll burst.

1563
01:01:59,261 --> 01:02:01,101
Throw these.

1564
01:02:01,131 --> 01:02:02,201
Hurry!

1565
01:02:02,901 --> 01:02:03,961
Hurry!

1566
01:02:04,361 --> 01:02:05,601
You're doing great.

1567
01:02:05,731 --> 01:02:08,231
Ji Won is doing a great job.

1568
01:02:08,231 --> 01:02:09,961
- Throw them. - Let's do this!

1569
01:02:09,961 --> 01:02:12,531
(Men's Team starts throwing.)

1570
01:02:12,531 --> 01:02:13,661
It's okay.

1571
01:02:13,761 --> 01:02:14,861
Keep it up!

1572
01:02:15,301 --> 01:02:18,131
Look at that. We should aim there.

1573
01:02:18,131 --> 01:02:21,061
Aim a weak part.

1574
01:02:21,701 --> 01:02:23,401
Aim at the centre.

1575
01:02:23,401 --> 01:02:24,631
- At the centre? - Yes.

1576
01:02:24,631 --> 01:02:25,831
You're doing great.

1577
01:02:26,101 --> 01:02:28,131
There you go.

1578
01:02:28,431 --> 01:02:30,101
It's driving me crazy.

1579
01:02:30,501 --> 01:02:32,961
It's opening here.

1580
01:02:32,961 --> 01:02:35,501
(They might be done soon.)

1581
01:02:36,501 --> 01:02:38,061
- Aim here. - There?

1582
01:02:38,061 --> 01:02:39,401
(Jae Seok points at the wrong place.)

1583
01:02:39,401 --> 01:02:40,661
- There? - Not the centre?

1584
01:02:40,661 --> 01:02:42,461
(Don't try to fool us.)

1585
01:02:42,461 --> 01:02:44,431
Where should we aim?

1586
01:02:44,431 --> 01:02:45,961
I think it's here.

1587
01:02:45,961 --> 01:02:47,801
Come near.

1588
01:02:47,961 --> 01:02:49,801
(Mi Sun seems to be working hard.)

1589
01:02:49,831 --> 01:02:51,061
I'll lower it.

1590
01:02:51,061 --> 01:02:54,361
(She's throwing at Jong Kook.)

1591
01:02:56,301 --> 01:02:57,361
(He's working so hard.)

1592
01:02:57,361 --> 01:02:59,461
It's very sturdy.

1593
01:02:59,461 --> 01:03:00,661
(You're working too hard.)

1594
01:03:00,661 --> 01:03:02,031
It's too hard.

1595
01:03:06,301 --> 01:03:07,361
(She hits Jong Kook.)

1596
01:03:08,331 --> 01:03:11,561
(Why do I feel like I'm keep getting hit?)

1597
01:03:13,261 --> 01:03:14,261
(It hits Gary.)

1598
01:03:14,261 --> 01:03:15,931
Keep going. It's about to open.

1599
01:03:15,931 --> 01:03:18,231
(She's blatantly hitting the other members.)

1600
01:03:20,361 --> 01:03:21,861
I'm sorry.

1601
01:03:21,861 --> 01:03:24,401
- Are you sure it was a mistake? - I'm sorry.

1602
01:03:24,401 --> 01:03:25,731
(I almost got caught.)

1603
01:03:27,301 --> 01:03:28,501
Keep it up!

1604
01:03:28,931 --> 01:03:31,531
It's almost done.

1605
01:03:31,901 --> 01:03:33,701
- We're almost there. - Just a bit more.

1606
01:03:33,901 --> 01:03:36,731
(Men's Team's basket starts to break.)

1607
01:03:37,401 --> 01:03:39,061
Yes!

1608
01:03:39,061 --> 01:03:41,031
Why doesn't it burst?

1609
01:03:41,501 --> 01:03:43,161
Aim at the side.

1610
01:03:43,161 --> 01:03:44,761
Aim at the side.

1611
01:03:44,761 --> 01:03:46,001
(Which spy will win?)

1612
01:03:46,001 --> 01:03:47,731
It's done.

1613
01:03:47,961 --> 01:03:50,501
We're almost there. It's coming out!

1614
01:03:51,401 --> 01:03:53,101
(Men's Team succeeded.)

1615
01:03:53,101 --> 01:03:55,331
- We're done! - Yes!

1616
01:03:56,831 --> 01:03:59,001
(Gosh)

1617
01:04:00,301 --> 01:04:04,401
(I'm not smiling on the inside.)

1618
01:04:04,401 --> 01:04:05,461
We won!

1619
01:04:05,531 --> 01:04:07,801
(Why did I betray them?)

1620
01:04:07,801 --> 01:04:09,401
This won't break.

1621
01:04:09,401 --> 01:04:11,431
It almost broke here.

1622
01:04:11,831 --> 01:04:13,431
Yes!

1623
01:04:13,431 --> 01:04:14,461
What a relief!

1624
01:04:14,461 --> 01:04:15,731
(Are you sure?)

1625
01:04:16,961 --> 01:04:19,161
(It's too bad.)

1626
01:04:19,761 --> 01:04:21,061
What a shame!

1627
01:04:21,061 --> 01:04:22,201
(Are you sure?)

1628
01:04:22,501 --> 01:04:24,331
That was close.

1629
01:04:24,331 --> 01:04:25,531
(Betrayals are followed by regrets.)

1630
01:04:27,161 --> 01:04:28,531
(Men's Team wins "Relay Race")

1631
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:31,001
(The two teams are tied at 200 to 200.)

1632
01:04:31,731 --> 01:04:33,761
With Men's Team...

1633
01:04:34,231 --> 01:04:37,101
winning "Relay Race", you're tied at 200 to 200.

1634
01:04:37,101 --> 01:04:38,361
We're tied.

1635
01:04:38,501 --> 01:04:39,701
Now,

1636
01:04:39,801 --> 01:04:41,961
the spies will determine the result.

1637
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:45,001
- It's unbelievable. - It's up to the spies now.

1638
01:04:45,001 --> 01:04:46,061
Now,

1639
01:04:46,231 --> 01:04:48,201
it's time to guess the spies.

1640
01:04:48,931 --> 01:04:50,631
(This is the final vote.)

1641
01:04:51,531 --> 01:04:54,301
(The moment of truth is here.)

1642
01:04:54,801 --> 01:04:56,561
(They start discussing.)

1643
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:57,931
I swear, I'm not a spy.

1644
01:05:00,461 --> 01:05:02,401
(I have something to tell you.)

1645
01:05:02,401 --> 01:05:05,731
Trust me. I was a spy at first.

1646
01:05:05,931 --> 01:05:07,301
(I was a spy at first.)

1647
01:05:07,301 --> 01:05:09,801
(Min Kyung reveals her truth.)

1648
01:05:09,801 --> 01:05:12,431
(What?)

1649
01:05:12,561 --> 01:05:14,431
But I changed.

1650
01:05:15,001 --> 01:05:17,161
(She even confesses her betrayal.)

1651
01:05:17,161 --> 01:05:21,501
(What is she talking about?)

1652
01:05:22,301 --> 01:05:24,461
Our team was winning at first,

1653
01:05:24,701 --> 01:05:26,401
so I changed.

1654
01:05:26,401 --> 01:05:27,431
Can you do that?

1655
01:05:27,431 --> 01:05:30,901
I could do that by ripping off Jae Seok's name tag.

1656
01:05:30,901 --> 01:05:32,961
Didn't any of you see me doing that?

1657
01:05:32,961 --> 01:05:35,261
Trust me.

1658
01:05:35,331 --> 01:05:39,131
- The other spy must have no idea. - Exactly.

1659
01:05:39,301 --> 01:05:41,031
(Is that true?)

1660
01:05:41,961 --> 01:05:44,261
(Jae Seok is left alone.)

1661
01:05:44,931 --> 01:05:47,301
(This doesn't feel right.)

1662
01:05:47,301 --> 01:05:48,601
You're not suspecting me, are you?

1663
01:05:49,531 --> 01:05:51,361
(Everyone's suspecting Jae Seok.)

1664
01:05:51,361 --> 01:05:53,001
Are you?

1665
01:05:53,001 --> 01:05:55,161
Isn't it too obvious?

1666
01:05:55,731 --> 01:05:56,801
You're mistaken.

1667
01:05:56,801 --> 01:05:58,531
- Come here. - I mean...

1668
01:05:58,531 --> 01:05:59,931
We've been talking about what to eat tonight.

1669
01:05:59,931 --> 01:06:03,231
You're making me look like a spy.

1670
01:06:03,231 --> 01:06:07,001
It feels like reading a mystery novel.

1671
01:06:07,201 --> 01:06:10,301
- I'm so confused. - We've decided.

1672
01:06:10,731 --> 01:06:11,931
You've decided, too, haven't you?

1673
01:06:12,161 --> 01:06:13,531
I have.

1674
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:15,931
You have? Is he the spy?

1675
01:06:16,361 --> 01:06:17,661
For sure.

1676
01:06:17,731 --> 01:06:21,561
(Let me tell you. Jae Seok is the spy.)

1677
01:06:21,561 --> 01:06:23,831
(If they guess it right, they'll win.)

1678
01:06:23,831 --> 01:06:25,231
Is it possible to change the spy?

1679
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:27,901
(Will they trust Min Kyung?)

1680
01:06:28,031 --> 01:06:30,561
- Jae Seok, go first. - Should I?

1681
01:06:30,701 --> 01:06:31,861
If I go first,

1682
01:06:32,361 --> 01:06:34,201
I think you'll talk about me.

1683
01:06:34,201 --> 01:06:36,001
- We were talking about what to eat. - I'll go first.

1684
01:06:36,001 --> 01:06:37,001
Good luck.

1685
01:06:37,001 --> 01:06:39,061
(Jae Seok goes first.)

1686
01:06:39,261 --> 01:06:42,561
Trust me. I was a spy at first,

1687
01:06:42,561 --> 01:06:44,331
but I changed.

1688
01:06:44,331 --> 01:06:48,561
(Whom will Jae Seok use to change the public opinion?)

1689
01:06:48,561 --> 01:06:50,531
(Song Ji Hyo)

1690
01:06:50,531 --> 01:06:52,531
The spy doesn't know?

1691
01:06:52,531 --> 01:06:53,531
Go ahead.

1692
01:06:53,531 --> 01:06:56,301
- Should I go? - Can the spy not know?

1693
01:06:56,301 --> 01:06:58,801
- Yu Ra. Trust me. - You seem to be...

1694
01:06:58,801 --> 01:07:00,031
suspecting me.

1695
01:07:01,901 --> 01:07:04,661
(Trust me and you'll win.)

1696
01:07:05,861 --> 01:07:09,831
(Whom will Yu Ra choose?)

1697
01:07:10,801 --> 01:07:12,731
(Yu Jae Seok)

1698
01:07:12,731 --> 01:07:14,861
My goodness. What should I do?

1699
01:07:14,861 --> 01:07:16,661
Can I trust her?

1700
01:07:21,161 --> 01:07:23,231
If it was a lie, I'll be shocked.

1701
01:07:25,431 --> 01:07:26,801
(She didn't trust Min Kyung.)

1702
01:07:26,801 --> 01:07:27,901
It's my gut feeling.

1703
01:07:28,431 --> 01:07:29,431
Trust me.

1704
01:07:29,431 --> 01:07:32,531
(Which team will guess the spy right and win?)

1705
01:07:33,401 --> 01:07:34,961
(All votes are in.)

1706
01:07:34,961 --> 01:07:36,261
Is that possible?

1707
01:07:36,501 --> 01:07:37,961
All votes are in.

1708
01:07:37,961 --> 01:07:39,031
Who is it?

1709
01:07:39,031 --> 01:07:40,801
We'll give you 100 points if you guessed it right.

1710
01:07:40,801 --> 01:07:42,661
That's generous of you.

1711
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:44,331
I can't wait.

1712
01:07:45,901 --> 01:07:47,061
The final score...

1713
01:07:47,061 --> 01:07:49,961
(They're tied at 200 to 200.)

1714
01:07:49,961 --> 01:07:52,861
(The vote will determine the winner.)

1715
01:07:52,861 --> 01:07:55,531
(Which team will win?)

1716
01:07:55,531 --> 01:07:57,361
The final score for Men's Team is 300...

1717
01:07:57,701 --> 01:07:59,261
and Women's Team, 200.

1718
01:08:01,031 --> 01:08:04,901
(Men's Team: 300, Women's Team: 200)

1719
01:08:05,931 --> 01:08:08,061
(Did they fail to guess the spy?)

1720
01:08:09,231 --> 01:08:11,761
(I told you Jae Seok was the spy.)

1721
01:08:11,761 --> 01:08:13,801
Did we guess it right?

1722
01:08:13,801 --> 01:08:15,831
Whose name did you write?

1723
01:08:16,301 --> 01:08:17,331
Did you write my name?

1724
01:08:18,131 --> 01:08:20,231
- Did you? - I didn't write your name.

1725
01:08:20,631 --> 01:08:21,901
(They're at a loss for words.)

1726
01:08:21,901 --> 01:08:23,131
I didn't write your name.

1727
01:08:23,361 --> 01:08:25,231
(Why didn't you trust me?)

1728
01:08:25,231 --> 01:08:26,601
Oh my.

1729
01:08:27,931 --> 01:08:32,161
(Yu Ra was the only one who trusted Min Kyung.)

1730
01:08:33,031 --> 01:08:37,501
(The other 3 suspected Min Kyung.)

1731
01:08:38,131 --> 01:08:41,261
(Women's Team failed to guess who the spy was.)

1732
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:44,431
Let me tell you who the spy for Women's Team was.

1733
01:08:44,661 --> 01:08:46,101
(Bitter)

1734
01:08:46,631 --> 01:08:51,531
- It was Jae Seok. - I knew it.

1735
01:08:52,301 --> 01:08:54,701
- I told you. - Oh my.

1736
01:08:54,701 --> 01:08:56,601
(Why didn't you trust me?)

1737
01:08:56,601 --> 01:08:59,501
- I told you. - She betrayed once more.

1738
01:08:59,501 --> 01:09:00,931
Did you betray once more?

1739
01:09:01,631 --> 01:09:02,761
(Welcome to the world of betrayals.)

1740
01:09:02,761 --> 01:09:03,961
Min Kyung.

1741
01:09:04,161 --> 01:09:05,401
I can't believe you.

1742
01:09:05,631 --> 01:09:07,701
You told the others to choose me, right?

1743
01:09:08,201 --> 01:09:09,961
How could you do this to us?

1744
01:09:09,961 --> 01:09:13,931
Ji Won. I told you it was him.

1745
01:09:13,931 --> 01:09:17,701
- Didn't anyone else choose him? - Only Yu Ra trusted me.

1746
01:09:17,701 --> 01:09:19,961
The spies for Men's Team were...

1747
01:09:19,961 --> 01:09:21,701
(Men's Team's spies will be revealed.)

1748
01:09:22,661 --> 01:09:25,361
(Did they choose Mi Sun?)

1749
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:28,261
- Towards the end... - I knew immediately.

1750
01:09:28,261 --> 01:09:29,601
Who do you think it is?

1751
01:09:29,761 --> 01:09:31,201
(2 minutes before the vote)

1752
01:09:31,201 --> 01:09:32,861
(I should remain calm.)

1753
01:09:32,861 --> 01:09:35,571
Mi Sun threw the balls at us.

1754
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:36,731
I got hit many times.

1755
01:09:37,571 --> 01:09:40,131
It gave me a hint.

1756
01:09:41,071 --> 01:09:44,501
(3 of them chose Mi Sun.)

1757
01:09:44,501 --> 01:09:48,801
(They succeeded in finding the spy.)

1758
01:09:49,701 --> 01:09:51,631
The spies for Men's Team are...

1759
01:09:52,631 --> 01:09:53,661
Mi Sun...

1760
01:09:53,701 --> 01:09:55,431
- Really? - Really?

1761
01:09:55,431 --> 01:09:57,361
- You got caught. - and...

1762
01:09:57,901 --> 01:09:59,701
And Haha.

1763
01:10:01,631 --> 01:10:03,701
- Were there two? - Were there two?

1764
01:10:03,861 --> 01:10:04,931
Haha.

1765
01:10:05,731 --> 01:10:07,331
Were there two?

1766
01:10:07,331 --> 01:10:08,631
Were there two spies?

1767
01:10:09,701 --> 01:10:11,661
(How did they become comrades?)

1768
01:10:11,661 --> 01:10:12,761
What is this?

1769
01:10:13,101 --> 01:10:14,661
I choose...

1770
01:10:14,661 --> 01:10:16,261
(Mi Sun chose her comrade.)

1771
01:10:16,261 --> 01:10:17,601
(She chose Haha.)

1772
01:10:17,601 --> 01:10:18,731
Haha.

1773
01:10:18,731 --> 01:10:20,531
(She chose Haha as her fellow spy.)

1774
01:10:20,901 --> 01:10:25,031
You should make Women's Team win.

1775
01:10:25,031 --> 01:10:26,071
My goodness.

1776
01:10:26,071 --> 01:10:28,831
(That's how Haha became a spy.)

1777
01:10:30,331 --> 01:10:32,001
(Now, they both failed their missions.)

1778
01:10:32,501 --> 01:10:34,301
I told you about Haha.

1779
01:10:34,301 --> 01:10:35,931
- I told you. - This is unbelievable.

1780
01:10:36,431 --> 01:10:38,801
That's why Haha kept suspecting Seok Jin.

1781
01:10:39,331 --> 01:10:40,831
I couldn't find a moment to betray.

1782
01:10:40,831 --> 01:10:42,961
We were losing the entire time.

1783
01:10:43,931 --> 01:10:47,131
(Many shared the spies' workload...)

1784
01:10:47,131 --> 01:10:50,071
(by doing horribly at the games.)

1785
01:10:51,131 --> 01:10:56,031
(He sometimes focused on the game to avoid suspicion,)

1786
01:10:56,031 --> 01:10:57,761
(but the other members were so bad.)

1787
01:10:57,761 --> 01:11:00,361
Is he a spy?

1788
01:11:02,961 --> 01:11:06,431
(Everyone is helping me.)

1789
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,931
(I thought Men's Team would lose.)

1790
01:11:09,931 --> 01:11:12,801
The final winner is Men's Team.

1791
01:11:13,601 --> 01:11:16,131
Jae Seok succeeded his mission as a spy.

1792
01:11:18,331 --> 01:11:19,801
(Hurray!)

1793
01:11:21,901 --> 01:11:23,801
Are you happy?

1794
01:11:24,201 --> 01:11:27,031
- You're terrible. - Are you that happy?

1795
01:11:27,031 --> 01:11:28,101
Yeon Jae, don't get me wrong.

1796
01:11:28,101 --> 01:11:29,861
That's not it.

1797
01:11:30,101 --> 01:11:31,831
I knew it.

1798
01:11:31,961 --> 01:11:34,401
Min Kyung betrayed twice and failed,

1799
01:11:34,531 --> 01:11:36,101
so she'll be penalised.

1800
01:11:36,101 --> 01:11:39,161
(Min Kyung will pay for dinner.)

1801
01:11:39,431 --> 01:11:41,631
- Amazing! - Nice!

1802
01:11:41,661 --> 01:11:45,631
Give me a call, baby, baby

1803
01:11:45,731 --> 01:11:47,571
(She's dancing to celebrate it.)

1804
01:11:47,701 --> 01:11:49,161
No one trusted her.

1805
01:11:49,301 --> 01:11:50,431
Take your prizes.

1806
01:11:51,261 --> 01:11:52,831
(Men's Team and Jae Seok win prizes.)

1807
01:11:53,031 --> 01:11:55,331
- Why do you touch it? - I'm in Men's Team.

1808
01:11:55,361 --> 01:11:56,901
- You are? - I told you.

1809
01:11:57,531 --> 01:11:59,861
- What is it? - I'll take the prize today.

1810
01:12:00,801 --> 01:12:02,801
It's a notebook.

1811
01:12:04,531 --> 01:12:06,201
They're so cute.

1812
01:12:06,831 --> 01:12:08,631
- Are you serious? - They're cute.

1813
01:12:08,631 --> 01:12:10,461
- They're so cute. - They're cute.

1814
01:12:11,301 --> 01:12:14,031
We'll give Jae Seok another prize for fulfilling his duties.

1815
01:12:14,031 --> 01:12:15,501
What did he do?

1816
01:12:15,501 --> 01:12:17,201
Give it to me somewhere else.

1817
01:12:17,201 --> 01:12:19,001
Seriously.

1818
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:21,531
They're all watching.

1819
01:12:21,801 --> 01:12:24,331
- Let me see. - That's not it.

1820
01:12:24,331 --> 01:12:25,501
Are you proud?

1821
01:12:26,631 --> 01:12:27,961
That's not it.

1822
01:12:28,231 --> 01:12:30,861
Why did you give it to me here?

1823
01:12:31,101 --> 01:12:33,801
Jae Seok is the only happy one.

1824
01:12:33,801 --> 01:12:35,661
Why does he get another prize?

1825
01:12:35,661 --> 01:12:37,431
I got nothing when I won last time!

1826
01:12:37,431 --> 01:12:39,571
Today's winner was me.

1827
01:12:40,101 --> 01:12:41,431
I made it.

1828
01:12:41,571 --> 01:12:43,001
(Jong Kook is jealous.)

1829
01:12:43,001 --> 01:12:45,661
I'm 32 years old!

1830
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:47,501
I don't have kids.

1831
01:12:47,501 --> 01:12:49,501
Give them to your kids later.

1832
01:12:49,571 --> 01:12:51,231
Should I have another kid?

1833
01:12:52,001 --> 01:12:53,401
Thank you for today.

1834
01:12:53,401 --> 01:12:55,301
(They're having dinner.)

1835
01:12:55,601 --> 01:12:56,901
Thank you, Min Kyung.

1836
01:12:56,901 --> 01:12:58,571
Thank you.

1837
01:12:58,931 --> 01:13:00,301
(Happy)

1838
01:13:00,761 --> 01:13:02,031
Eat a lot.

1839
01:13:03,301 --> 01:13:05,231
Why did you betray us?

1840
01:13:06,431 --> 01:13:07,961
Seok Jin can take care of himself.

1841
01:13:08,831 --> 01:13:10,161
Eat as soon as it's done.

1842
01:13:11,331 --> 01:13:13,161
Min Kyung, please pay for the food.

1843
01:13:14,071 --> 01:13:15,501
Min Kyung.

1844
01:13:15,501 --> 01:13:17,431
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1845
01:13:17,571 --> 01:13:18,631
I'm sorry.

1846
01:13:18,631 --> 01:13:22,761
Give me a call, baby, baby

1847
01:13:24,361 --> 01:13:25,501
I'll order some more.

1848
01:13:26,071 --> 01:13:30,961
(She pays 735 dollars for her betrayal.)

1849
01:13:30,961 --> 01:13:32,461
This is what happens to betrayers.

1850
01:13:32,931 --> 01:13:34,001
(The receipt is being printed.)

1851
01:13:34,001 --> 01:13:35,231
Do you hear that?

1852
01:13:35,801 --> 01:13:36,961
It's the sound of betrayal.

1853
01:13:36,961 --> 01:13:39,431
(We thank Mi Sun, Ji Won, Yeon Jae, Min Kyung and Yu Ra.)

1854
01:13:39,431 --> 01:13:41,361
(It's a fall day in 2016.)

1855
01:13:42,431 --> 01:13:43,571
(The avatars...)

1856
01:13:43,571 --> 01:13:45,031
I'm your master.

1857
01:13:45,501 --> 01:13:47,231
(will have to obey...)

1858
01:13:47,231 --> 01:13:48,961
(their masters.)

1859
01:13:50,201 --> 01:13:52,131
(Avatars and their masters)

1860
01:13:52,131 --> 01:13:54,331
(Their mysterious game starts.)

1861
01:13:55,101 --> 01:13:57,071
(My Avatar Can)

1862
01:13:58,201 --> 01:13:59,531
(With the auction,)

1863
01:13:59,531 --> 01:14:02,001
(a war among the avatars has begun.)

1864
01:14:02,001 --> 01:14:03,661
The highest bid is 61 right now.

1865
01:14:03,661 --> 01:14:04,701
(The master's order is the way and the truth.)

1866
01:14:04,701 --> 01:14:06,501
(Control your avatar...)

1867
01:14:06,501 --> 01:14:07,571
(to win the game.)

1868
01:14:08,001 --> 01:14:10,001
