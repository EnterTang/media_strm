1
00:00:00,771 --> 00:00:02,841
(Running Man)

2
00:00:04,928 --> 00:00:08,758
(Gary joined Running Man 7 years ago.)

3
00:00:09,198 --> 00:00:12,828
(We thought he'd be with us until the end.)

4
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:15,958
("Gary leaves Running Man to focus on his music.")

5
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:20,558
("Gary completed the last filming.")

6
00:00:20,658 --> 00:00:22,898
- This is the last episode with him. - I know.

7
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:26,098
(We prepared everything for Gary to leave us without shedding tears.)

8
00:00:26,098 --> 00:00:27,298
(That's what Gary thought.)

9
00:00:27,298 --> 00:00:31,028
(You know we can't just let you go so easily.)

10
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:34,798
(This special farewell episode might be a little nasty.)

11
00:00:35,198 --> 00:00:39,058
(A goodbye party where the members hold back their tears.)

12
00:00:39,798 --> 00:00:46,028
(Will Gary really be able to leave Running Man safely?)

13
00:00:47,428 --> 00:00:49,828
(At a cafe in Sinsa-dong)

14
00:00:51,258 --> 00:00:57,858
(There are only 6 chairs instead of 7 which is unusual.)

15
00:00:59,228 --> 00:01:01,298
(Today is the last day with Gary.)

16
00:01:01,298 --> 00:01:03,128
What's this? No one has arrived yet.

17
00:01:03,498 --> 00:01:04,568
No one has.

18
00:01:04,728 --> 00:01:06,728
I feel pretty depressed from the early morning.

19
00:01:07,628 --> 00:01:08,898
- I've got the blues. - Let's go out!

20
00:01:09,298 --> 00:01:10,428
Hello.

21
00:01:10,928 --> 00:01:12,098
Hello!

22
00:01:13,628 --> 00:01:15,568
Didn't you feel weird when you woke up this morning?

23
00:01:15,568 --> 00:01:16,598
(Why are there only 6 chairs?)

24
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:21,298
(Other members also arrive at the cafe.)

25
00:01:24,028 --> 00:01:27,228
(Wait.)

26
00:01:28,028 --> 00:01:32,758
(She realises there are only six chairs and finds it hard to sit.)

27
00:01:36,998 --> 00:01:38,658
As you all know,

28
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:42,498
- today is the last day with Gary. - I know.

29
00:01:43,258 --> 00:01:44,358
From about two weeks ago,

30
00:01:44,628 --> 00:01:47,798
Gary privately told all of us...

31
00:01:48,258 --> 00:01:51,528
about his decision to leave Running Man.

32
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:54,098
I was going to persuade him...

33
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:57,498
before he told me the reason.

34
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:01,958
Gary has a goal of his life which he desperately wants to achieve.

35
00:02:02,398 --> 00:02:06,928
Although it's sad to let him go,

36
00:02:07,098 --> 00:02:09,498
I believe that we should respect his decision.

37
00:02:10,028 --> 00:02:12,598
We couldn't help but understand him.

38
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:15,498
(We decided to let him go for his happiness.)

39
00:02:15,498 --> 00:02:16,968
We should wish him happiness.

40
00:02:16,968 --> 00:02:19,258
Then will the cameraman who's in charge of Gary quit as well?

41
00:02:19,258 --> 00:02:21,128
(Will the cameraman who's in charge of Gary quit as well?)

42
00:02:21,998 --> 00:02:23,558
- That's even sadder. - He's right.

43
00:02:23,558 --> 00:02:25,158
- Really? - Where is Gary's cameraman?

44
00:02:25,528 --> 00:02:26,528
(He cried all night long.)

45
00:02:26,528 --> 00:02:28,028
Will you quit, too?

46
00:02:28,698 --> 00:02:30,828
I haven't given you the money gift for your wedding yet.

47
00:02:30,828 --> 00:02:32,358
- Not yet? - Gosh.

48
00:02:32,358 --> 00:02:33,628
He now even has a baby!

49
00:02:33,628 --> 00:02:34,968
- He has a baby. - Goodness.

50
00:02:35,058 --> 00:02:36,828
- I'll give you today. - How can you do that?

51
00:02:36,828 --> 00:02:39,028
I'll give you today no matter what. Please tell me your account number.

52
00:02:39,028 --> 00:02:40,128
I can't believe this.

53
00:02:40,128 --> 00:02:42,398
Today is the last filming day with Gary.

54
00:02:43,128 --> 00:02:46,998
We pondered upon today's episode.

55
00:02:46,998 --> 00:02:49,958
We thought how we should let Gary go after seven years.

56
00:02:50,498 --> 00:02:52,628
So we prepared this.

57
00:02:53,428 --> 00:02:56,928
"Running Man Who Cannot Breakup and Gary Who Cannot Leave".

58
00:02:56,928 --> 00:02:58,128
It's like a nasty breakup.

59
00:02:58,128 --> 00:02:59,898
Will we take back things we gave him before?

60
00:03:00,328 --> 00:03:02,058
Will Ji Hyo cry a lot today?

61
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:05,058
Gary thinks the shooting will start at three o'clock.

62
00:03:05,828 --> 00:03:10,098
He's working in a studio which is 50m away from here.

63
00:03:11,028 --> 00:03:16,528
You'll pay a surprise visit and carry out a secret mission.

64
00:03:16,528 --> 00:03:18,428
- What? - A secret mission?

65
00:03:19,258 --> 00:03:20,398
A secret mission?

66
00:03:20,928 --> 00:03:24,798
Without getting caught by Gary until the end of the race,

67
00:03:25,298 --> 00:03:29,698
each member will steal an item that commemorates the time with Gary.

68
00:03:31,698 --> 00:03:33,528
Each member will steal an item.

69
00:03:33,528 --> 00:03:34,598
You want us to steal something?

70
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:36,258
This is a farewell episode, isn't it?

71
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:37,558
Are you encouraging us to steal?

72
00:03:38,328 --> 00:03:39,628
Yes. But...

73
00:03:39,628 --> 00:03:42,728
(You have to satisfy a requirement.)

74
00:03:42,728 --> 00:03:46,128
The item you steal must be bigger than the item previously stolen.

75
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,398
The role of the first runner is important.

76
00:03:50,398 --> 00:03:52,198
- Is there a fixed order? - No.

77
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:55,398
- You need to steal it secretly. - You need to be sly.

78
00:03:55,398 --> 00:03:57,798
But we won't know who stole what.

79
00:03:57,798 --> 00:03:59,598
Gary's studio is located on the fifth floor.

80
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:01,728
Fourth floor is where the box seats are located.

81
00:04:01,728 --> 00:04:04,898
On the fourth floor, we'll check...

82
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,898
if your item is acceptable or not.

83
00:04:06,898 --> 00:04:09,698
The item must be from the studio. It is only acceptable when...

84
00:04:09,698 --> 00:04:12,158
the item is carried out without Gary's interruption.

85
00:04:12,298 --> 00:04:14,028
If he interrupts you from stealing,

86
00:04:14,058 --> 00:04:16,498
you must compensate twice the price of the item.

87
00:04:16,498 --> 00:04:18,228
- You must compensate him. - Excuse me?

88
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:19,798
(Compensate Gary.)

89
00:04:19,828 --> 00:04:21,128
Double the price?

90
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:23,858
We really might end up at a prison.

91
00:04:24,658 --> 00:04:28,098
Just like what Haha said, we could be handcuffed at the end.

92
00:04:28,158 --> 00:04:32,098
Anyone who fails to steal until the race ends...

93
00:04:32,098 --> 00:04:34,768
will face a crucial penalty at the end.

94
00:04:35,058 --> 00:04:37,428
How can we be asked to steal on TV?

95
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,828
Let's just say we are stealing memories.

96
00:04:39,828 --> 00:04:41,028
Something to remember Gary by.

97
00:04:41,098 --> 00:04:43,798
- We are memory hunters. - "Memory hunters"?

98
00:04:43,798 --> 00:04:45,158
(Is that the best you got?)

99
00:04:45,158 --> 00:04:46,398
Why? What's wrong?

100
00:04:47,358 --> 00:04:49,728
(We are ready to hunt memories.)

101
00:04:49,728 --> 00:04:52,028
This is the Rodeo street.

102
00:04:52,028 --> 00:04:53,128
Yes, it is.

103
00:04:53,128 --> 00:04:54,458
(They're about to meet him.)

104
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,458
I didn't know Gary's studio was located here.

105
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:57,928
I didn't know, either.

106
00:04:57,928 --> 00:05:02,928
(Where are you going, Gary? We are on our way to steal.)

107
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:09,528
(You can't get off that easy. "Nameless Stealers")

108
00:05:10,898 --> 00:05:13,198
All right, let's go!

109
00:05:14,768 --> 00:05:16,058
This is it.

110
00:05:16,058 --> 00:05:18,098
I had no idea. Is this it?

111
00:05:18,558 --> 00:05:19,768
This must be it.

112
00:05:20,498 --> 00:05:23,028
Gary's studio is tightly closed.

113
00:05:24,128 --> 00:05:26,228
I can come to Gary's studio...

114
00:05:26,398 --> 00:05:28,398
and go to my dermatologist.

115
00:05:28,498 --> 00:05:30,028
Jae Seok, go to my brother.

116
00:05:30,028 --> 00:05:31,458
- What? - Go to him.

117
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,258
He is worried about your wrinkles.

118
00:05:34,258 --> 00:05:36,328
I know. What should I do?

119
00:05:36,328 --> 00:05:39,228
(Raiding Gary's studio has just begun.)

120
00:05:39,558 --> 00:05:40,598
Hello, Gary.

121
00:05:40,598 --> 00:05:42,128
What were you doing?

122
00:05:43,058 --> 00:05:45,728
(Did we surprise you?)

123
00:05:47,298 --> 00:05:49,128
(The camera crew set up the perimeter in advance.)

124
00:05:51,128 --> 00:05:54,498
(The staff acquired Gary's studio in a blink of an eye.)

125
00:05:54,598 --> 00:05:57,028
(Who am I? Where am I?)

126
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,428
Gary, here is your outfit and your microphone.

127
00:05:59,428 --> 00:06:00,598
Oh, my outfit.

128
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:03,758
Didn't you say you were coming later?

129
00:06:03,758 --> 00:06:06,228
Be honest. Don't you regret resigning?

130
00:06:06,228 --> 00:06:09,258
- Don't you? - I was going to start off crying.

131
00:06:10,758 --> 00:06:12,358
(Gary is changing into his outfit.)

132
00:06:12,358 --> 00:06:13,598
I'm quite sad.

133
00:06:14,498 --> 00:06:16,558
(Why are they looking around?)

134
00:06:16,558 --> 00:06:17,928
(Let's see.)

135
00:06:19,298 --> 00:06:25,258
(Gary's studio has 7 years' worth of souvenirs from Running Man.)

136
00:06:25,698 --> 00:06:28,498
When was this from?

137
00:06:28,558 --> 00:06:29,698
Gold, silver and bronze?

138
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:32,458
What is this?

139
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,798
(Shall we get started?)

140
00:06:37,558 --> 00:06:41,928
(The studio is full of small and big objects.)

141
00:06:44,128 --> 00:06:49,028
(Can they steal without Gary noticing?)

142
00:06:50,098 --> 00:06:52,328
Well, today is...

143
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:55,928
- Gary's last day joining us. - You're right.

144
00:06:56,398 --> 00:07:02,898
(They shared pleasures and sorrows for 7 years.)

145
00:07:02,898 --> 00:07:04,358
- Did you cry? - What?

146
00:07:04,898 --> 00:07:06,098
I did feel sad.

147
00:07:06,198 --> 00:07:09,358
Even I felt weird this morning.

148
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:12,428
You two should sit together today.

149
00:07:12,428 --> 00:07:13,698
- That's right. - You're the Monday Couple.

150
00:07:13,698 --> 00:07:15,758
Switch seats, Kwang Soo.

151
00:07:15,798 --> 00:07:17,398
Ji Hyo should move there.

152
00:07:18,098 --> 00:07:23,058
(As we say goodbye to Gary, we must say goodbye to Monday Couple, too.)

153
00:07:23,058 --> 00:07:27,198
(Gary and Ji Hyo 6 years ago)

154
00:07:27,758 --> 00:07:29,398
- Promise? - Promise.

155
00:07:29,398 --> 00:07:32,398
(From the moment they began to get to know each other...)

156
00:07:32,498 --> 00:07:34,828
(until this moment as Monday Couple...)

157
00:07:34,828 --> 00:07:37,728
This sea resembles you.

158
00:07:37,728 --> 00:07:41,428
(They have beautiful memories to cherish together.)

159
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:44,828
(Goodbye, Monday boyfriend.)

160
00:07:44,828 --> 00:07:48,358
Ji Hyo is now shooting a drama with Sun Kyun.

161
00:07:48,358 --> 00:07:51,258
She is having an affair on it.

162
00:07:51,258 --> 00:07:52,628
(Jae Seok breaks the mood.)

163
00:07:53,398 --> 00:07:55,058
Be the best actress specialising in having affairs on TV.

164
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,628
I have confidence in her.

165
00:07:56,858 --> 00:07:58,958
(Just as he wished, she became the best.)

166
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:02,128
We deliberated a lot what to do for our last episode.

167
00:08:02,128 --> 00:08:04,758
Do you know how far you ran over the course of seven years?

168
00:08:04,758 --> 00:08:06,128
- How far? - Yes.

169
00:08:06,128 --> 00:08:08,198
- How far we ran? - The distance during filming?

170
00:08:08,198 --> 00:08:10,598
If we count the time to Dubai, then it is a lot.

171
00:08:10,598 --> 00:08:12,228
How far do you think we ran?

172
00:08:12,228 --> 00:08:13,428
About 20,000km?

173
00:08:13,428 --> 00:08:14,628
- Seok Jin. - 20,000km?

174
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:17,558
A round trip abroad should be about 10,000km.

175
00:08:17,558 --> 00:08:19,828
- We also went to Australia. - You're right.

176
00:08:19,828 --> 00:08:23,598
We calculated the total distance from the first episode.

177
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:26,358
To be accurate, it is 77,093km.

178
00:08:26,358 --> 00:08:29,258
(The total distance is 77,093km.)

179
00:08:30,368 --> 00:08:36,128
(The total distance outside of Korea is 43,063.17km.)

180
00:08:36,128 --> 00:08:37,368
(The total distance in Korea is 33,931.83km)

181
00:08:37,368 --> 00:08:40,328
(The accumulated distance is 77,093km)

182
00:08:40,328 --> 00:08:42,798
If you count the distance I was dragged by Jong Kook...

183
00:08:42,798 --> 00:08:43,958
If you count that too then...

184
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,958
- I bet that distance is longer. - The camera didn't catch them all.

185
00:08:47,198 --> 00:08:49,058
This brings us back to today's race.

186
00:08:49,398 --> 00:08:50,998
It is "Balance the Distance".

187
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:52,258
"Balance the Distance"?

188
00:08:52,258 --> 00:08:53,958
- It rhymes. - We tried.

189
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,028
"Balance the Distance"?

190
00:08:55,028 --> 00:08:58,498
You must collect the total distance...

191
00:08:58,498 --> 00:09:01,058
that you ran during the seven years through playing various games.

192
00:09:01,098 --> 00:09:02,598
The game ends only when you have gathered all the distance.

193
00:09:02,598 --> 00:09:04,398
Gary, it's going to take about five months.

194
00:09:04,828 --> 00:09:06,528
We have to collect 77,000km.

195
00:09:07,198 --> 00:09:08,758
How do we gather the kilometres?

196
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:10,698
The game itself is quite simple.

197
00:09:10,698 --> 00:09:12,828
You can choose one of the category.

198
00:09:12,828 --> 00:09:15,868
The back side will tell you what kind of game to play. If you win,

199
00:09:16,128 --> 00:09:17,428
you get to keep the kilometres.

200
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:20,198
But if you lose, you will have to get finger flicks.

201
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:25,198
(Whenever the members win, they will have a chance to pick a present. )

202
00:09:26,028 --> 00:09:28,198
The faster you complete the distance,

203
00:09:28,198 --> 00:09:30,598
the better the present Gary will receive.

204
00:09:30,598 --> 00:09:32,498
Are these presents for me?

205
00:09:33,158 --> 00:09:36,028
If you gather all the distance in one try,

206
00:09:36,028 --> 00:09:38,398
he will get a round trip ticket to Europe.

207
00:09:38,398 --> 00:09:40,528
If you complete the distance in two tries, he will get a new laptop.

208
00:09:41,058 --> 00:09:43,558
If you finish in three tries, he'll get a premium Korean Beef package.

209
00:09:43,558 --> 00:09:46,228
I like the last one. 15 tries or more and he has to give us presents.

210
00:09:46,228 --> 00:09:47,728
That's meaningful.

211
00:09:47,728 --> 00:09:50,128
For us, that could be more suitable.

212
00:09:50,628 --> 00:09:51,758
(Presents to the whole staff?)

213
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,098
That will look nicest on television.

214
00:09:54,558 --> 00:09:56,598
I mean it is also customary...

215
00:09:56,598 --> 00:09:58,198
as a person who resigned.

216
00:10:00,028 --> 00:10:02,368
Please select the first category.

217
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:04,258
Let's test the water first.

218
00:10:04,258 --> 00:10:05,728
Why don't we try the easy ones first?

219
00:10:05,728 --> 00:10:07,998
If we finish in one try, don't I get a round trip ticket to Europe?

220
00:10:08,428 --> 00:10:10,128
- Then we should try. - How about we try?

221
00:10:10,128 --> 00:10:12,298
- Yes, let's do it. - Let's go for 77,000km.

222
00:10:12,298 --> 00:10:13,498
At once?

223
00:10:13,628 --> 00:10:14,998
I have a question.

224
00:10:15,258 --> 00:10:16,298
I have a question.

225
00:10:19,528 --> 00:10:20,828
I have a question.

226
00:10:21,258 --> 00:10:22,498
Has the game begun?

227
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:23,928
Yes, it has.

228
00:10:24,928 --> 00:10:30,928
(Running Man's secret mission starts as well.)

229
00:10:30,928 --> 00:10:36,458
(They must steal an object and bring it downstairs secretly.)

230
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:39,998
(Can everyone succeed?)

231
00:10:39,998 --> 00:10:42,228
Let's go for the whole distance.

232
00:10:42,228 --> 00:10:43,728
Let's go, let's go.

233
00:10:43,728 --> 00:10:46,498
Let's go for the one that everyone has to pass.

234
00:10:46,498 --> 00:10:49,528
Gary, come on. Let's go for it.

235
00:10:49,798 --> 00:10:50,798
Let's do it.

236
00:10:50,798 --> 00:10:52,758
Okay. If I get that ticket,

237
00:10:52,758 --> 00:10:54,158
I'll buy a ticket for someone, too.

238
00:10:54,328 --> 00:10:57,498
- Let's go. - I'll show you what it is.

239
00:10:57,498 --> 00:11:00,858
(The game for 77,000km is...)

240
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:05,128
(What is behind the board?)

241
00:11:05,128 --> 00:11:06,458
"Stand the Pain"?

242
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,558
(Stand the Pain)

243
00:11:09,398 --> 00:11:10,758
- What is that? - What is "Stand the Pain"?

244
00:11:10,758 --> 00:11:14,398
The game for completing the whole distance is...

245
00:11:15,528 --> 00:11:18,758
(Please tell us now.)

246
00:11:19,228 --> 00:11:22,298
- An expert will be joining us. - What?

247
00:11:22,698 --> 00:11:26,328
The special helper is one of the well-known therapists...

248
00:11:26,328 --> 00:11:30,728
in sports message. His name is Kim Young Joon.

249
00:11:30,728 --> 00:11:33,958
(I can remember it just like it was yesterday.)

250
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:41,628
(With his amazing hands, he ruled the members.)

251
00:11:41,628 --> 00:11:43,628
(Sports massage therapist, Kim Young Joon)

252
00:11:43,698 --> 00:11:45,758
He is here.

253
00:11:45,758 --> 00:11:47,358
(He is back to help the game.)

254
00:11:47,358 --> 00:11:48,998
- Oh my gosh. - He is really here.

255
00:11:48,998 --> 00:11:50,758
- Hello. - Welcome.

256
00:11:50,998 --> 00:11:52,428
I'll do it.

257
00:11:52,428 --> 00:11:53,698
I can do this.

258
00:11:53,698 --> 00:11:56,128
My shoulder is tense.

259
00:11:56,128 --> 00:11:57,998
(Everyone has to stand the pain for 10 seconds without screaming.)

260
00:11:57,998 --> 00:12:00,528
- Right here? - Get Ready.

261
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,928
Hold on, you are using your elbow? You are not using your hands?

262
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,928
- Why? - It makes no difference.

263
00:12:05,928 --> 00:12:07,498
Just stand the pain.

264
00:12:07,498 --> 00:12:09,998
Gary, if you scream, it's over.

265
00:12:09,998 --> 00:12:12,858
- He can do it. - Get ready.

266
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:18,328
- Start. - Poor Gary.

267
00:12:18,398 --> 00:12:20,028
You look so ugly.

268
00:12:20,528 --> 00:12:22,858
(A horrible looking squid is spotted in Apgujeong.)

269
00:12:22,858 --> 00:12:24,898
- He is holding it. - Time's almost up.

270
00:12:25,258 --> 00:12:27,898
You are almost there.

271
00:12:27,898 --> 00:12:30,628
(With breath taking appearance)

272
00:12:30,628 --> 00:12:31,698
Time's up.

273
00:12:31,698 --> 00:12:34,658
(Gary succeeds in standing the pain for 10 seconds.)

274
00:12:35,898 --> 00:12:37,498
This is the ugliest face I've seen in 10 years.

275
00:12:37,498 --> 00:12:39,698
- That was so ugly. - What did you do yesterday, Gary?

276
00:12:40,098 --> 00:12:41,958
You were shockingly ugly.

277
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:45,128
- That was something. - I can't see that face any more.

278
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:47,458
I don't want to let him go.

279
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:48,858
Please fix me up in editing.

280
00:12:50,098 --> 00:12:52,828
(Is this what you meant?)

281
00:12:52,828 --> 00:12:54,258
I mean among us,

282
00:12:54,698 --> 00:12:58,298
he is the only one who can be funny only with his face.

283
00:12:58,328 --> 00:12:59,458
I miss him already.

284
00:12:59,928 --> 00:13:02,598
I don't think I can stand the pain in my pelvis very well.

285
00:13:02,598 --> 00:13:04,898
No, Jae Seok. You can do this.

286
00:13:04,898 --> 00:13:06,758
- I mean, pelvis is... - Jae Seok, help me out.

287
00:13:06,758 --> 00:13:07,928
I can do other areas.

288
00:13:07,928 --> 00:13:09,658
Jae Seok. For me, you can surely hold 10 seconds.

289
00:13:09,658 --> 00:13:11,858
- Stand the pain. - Get ready.

290
00:13:12,298 --> 00:13:14,028
Your 10 seconds start now.

291
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:15,558
(For Gary, I can sacrifice my pelvis.)

292
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:19,898
(I must stand the pain.)

293
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:21,428
(Please, Jae Seok.)

294
00:13:21,858 --> 00:13:24,398
(Clutching)

295
00:13:24,398 --> 00:13:26,058
(He endured half the time.)

296
00:13:26,058 --> 00:13:27,198
(Shrieking)

297
00:13:27,898 --> 00:13:29,028
(Shrieking)

298
00:13:29,798 --> 00:13:32,558
(Their first attempt to complete the distance fails.)

299
00:13:33,428 --> 00:13:34,828
Come on.

300
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:38,428
(Please let us know if anyone knows how to fix overly massaged pelvis.)

301
00:13:39,358 --> 00:13:41,858
I thought my leg was going to fall out.

302
00:13:42,398 --> 00:13:46,298
What kind of therapist are you?

303
00:13:47,498 --> 00:13:50,658
Sir! My leg was about to fall off.

304
00:13:52,158 --> 00:13:54,128
Look how my right leg got longer.

305
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,658
Look at this.

306
00:13:56,658 --> 00:13:58,858
Look. It's gotten longer.

307
00:13:59,728 --> 00:14:02,428
- Isn't that a good thing? - I wish my legs were longer.

308
00:14:02,928 --> 00:14:05,028
Look at my legs.

309
00:14:05,028 --> 00:14:06,028
(There is a simple way of fixing that.)

310
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,428
(Let me do the other side as well.)

311
00:14:07,428 --> 00:14:09,328
Can you make the other leg longer as well?

312
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:10,658
Right there.

313
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:11,958
It hurts.

314
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:12,958
(This will hurt only for a second.)

315
00:14:14,298 --> 00:14:15,458
(Resisting)

316
00:14:18,328 --> 00:14:19,358
It's perfect now.

317
00:14:20,198 --> 00:14:22,228
- It's a miracle. - They're exactly the same length.

318
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,458
That's much better.

319
00:14:24,058 --> 00:14:26,028
- Finally. - You can walk now.

320
00:14:26,028 --> 00:14:28,058
- This is amazing. - You can walk now.

321
00:14:28,198 --> 00:14:30,158
- I got matching legs now. - We failed.

322
00:14:30,858 --> 00:14:32,298
Is there a penalty?

323
00:14:32,558 --> 00:14:33,558
Yes.

324
00:14:33,558 --> 00:14:34,558
(They blew their chance to win plane tickets to Europe.)

325
00:14:34,558 --> 00:14:37,128
You have to get finger flicked now.

326
00:14:37,128 --> 00:14:38,128
- Just one of us, right? - Yes.

327
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:40,898
The person who failed the mission should get penalised.

328
00:14:41,258 --> 00:14:42,858
The person who made the sound should get flicked.

329
00:14:42,858 --> 00:14:45,458
- No way. - It's Gary's last day.

330
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,198
- Gary should take it. - That sounds good.

331
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,258
(Gary wins the prize.)

332
00:14:49,258 --> 00:14:50,598
- What? - Let's do it.

333
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,128
We're doing this for you.

334
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,358
- Just do it. - Sounds good.

335
00:14:55,358 --> 00:14:57,228
- Come on, Gary. - Just do it.

336
00:14:57,358 --> 00:14:58,758
Chances like this don't come by very often.

337
00:14:58,758 --> 00:15:00,058
Can you let me go with some dignity?

338
00:15:00,058 --> 00:15:01,698
- What are you talking about? - This is my last day.

339
00:15:01,698 --> 00:15:03,098
Which is why we have to do this.

340
00:15:03,498 --> 00:15:05,428
- I'll let Ji Hyo hit me. - Are you sure about that?

341
00:15:05,428 --> 00:15:08,028
- Do it, Ji Hyo. - I'm not very good at this.

342
00:15:08,558 --> 00:15:10,628
I won't get another chance to get hit by you.

343
00:15:12,498 --> 00:15:15,058
(Okay, Gary. I'll make it quick.)

344
00:15:16,298 --> 00:15:17,298
Are you going to hit my forehead?

345
00:15:17,298 --> 00:15:18,328
Hold up.

346
00:15:18,558 --> 00:15:20,128
(Frightened)

347
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,198
Did you see that?

348
00:15:21,358 --> 00:15:23,428
At least count to three before you do it.

349
00:15:23,428 --> 00:15:25,828
I didn't want to put you through that.

350
00:15:25,828 --> 00:15:27,128
(His Monday Girlfriend is sweet yet scary.)

351
00:15:27,698 --> 00:15:28,698
Jong Kook?

352
00:15:30,628 --> 00:15:32,028
Hold on.

353
00:15:32,028 --> 00:15:33,028
(Why is Jae Seok calling Jong Kook?)

354
00:15:33,028 --> 00:15:35,028
That's scary.

355
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,658
(Moments ago)

356
00:15:37,658 --> 00:15:40,558
(Jong Kook stole a fan...)

357
00:15:40,558 --> 00:15:43,858
(and sneaked out.)

358
00:15:43,858 --> 00:15:47,028
(Jae Seok noticed that.)

359
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:52,358
(I'll be holding on to that.)

360
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:54,658
(Jong Kook pushes him away.)

361
00:15:54,658 --> 00:15:56,358
(He gets slammed into the wall.)

362
00:15:56,358 --> 00:15:58,128
What are you doing back there?

363
00:15:58,128 --> 00:16:00,658
(Jae Seok's time of ordeal)

364
00:16:00,658 --> 00:16:02,658
- What are you doing? - He bumped into the wall.

365
00:16:02,658 --> 00:16:04,298
Why did you do that?

366
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:06,958
It's nothing. I'm fine.

367
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,358
(What are they up to this time?)

368
00:16:08,358 --> 00:16:10,598
- What was that? - It didn't sound fine.

369
00:16:10,698 --> 00:16:11,858
I'm really fine.

370
00:16:11,858 --> 00:16:13,598
- Are you sure about that? - Yes.

371
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:14,858
(They're not going easy on each other for this mission.)

372
00:16:14,858 --> 00:16:16,428
(At least Gary didn't notice anything strange.)

373
00:16:17,028 --> 00:16:18,298
- Hold on. - Here I go.

374
00:16:18,928 --> 00:16:20,398
Count to three.

375
00:16:20,398 --> 00:16:24,398
- Wait. - One, two, three.

376
00:16:24,798 --> 00:16:25,858
(Slapping)

377
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,558
(That was loud.)

378
00:16:28,558 --> 00:16:30,058
- What was that? - Good hit.

379
00:16:30,628 --> 00:16:32,458
(Ji Hyo closes the game with a finishing home run.)

380
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,698
(I'll let you go now, Gary.)

381
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:38,928
(It's time to say goodbye.)

382
00:16:40,498 --> 00:16:42,028
- That was a good hit. - Did you hear that?

383
00:16:42,028 --> 00:16:44,128
- That was loud. - Are you okay?

384
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,458
It sounded like something blew up.

385
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,128
It sounded like a plastic bag popped open.

386
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:49,358
I'm not even joking. That was really loud.

387
00:16:49,558 --> 00:16:50,828
Oh, my goodness.

388
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:53,298
- Is it red? - No, it's fine.

389
00:16:53,658 --> 00:16:56,128
It hurts from the inside.

390
00:16:56,128 --> 00:16:58,398
- That was a good hit. - She didn't punch me, did she?

391
00:16:58,398 --> 00:17:00,858
- That was amazing. - It's gotten red.

392
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,498
Can I pick the next person in line?

393
00:17:02,498 --> 00:17:03,498
Yes.

394
00:17:03,498 --> 00:17:05,428
(You can pick the next person to get finger flicked after you get hit.)

395
00:17:05,428 --> 00:17:07,228
- What should we do next? - Please choose the next game.

396
00:17:07,228 --> 00:17:09,428
- Let's do an easy one. - Okay.

397
00:17:09,698 --> 00:17:11,628
- We should do a hard one. - Let's do the yellow one.

398
00:17:11,828 --> 00:17:12,858
We should finish it off in one go.

399
00:17:12,858 --> 00:17:14,928
Let's do the one with 77,000km.

400
00:17:14,928 --> 00:17:17,298
- Fine. - This is our chance.

401
00:17:17,568 --> 00:17:19,228
We'll do 77,000km for Running Man.

402
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,658
Here it is.

403
00:17:20,658 --> 00:17:21,658
What is it?

404
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:30,028
(Carrying out this mission will award Gary with a laptop.)

405
00:17:32,068 --> 00:17:35,358
("Mascot")

406
00:17:36,068 --> 00:17:37,128
"Mascot"?

407
00:17:37,128 --> 00:17:38,128
What is that?

408
00:17:38,128 --> 00:17:39,398
(We have a mascot?)

409
00:17:39,398 --> 00:17:40,428
What is that?

410
00:17:41,258 --> 00:17:43,928
For this mission,

411
00:17:43,928 --> 00:17:46,128
you will be joined by Running Man's mascot.

412
00:17:46,568 --> 00:17:47,568
We have a mascot?

413
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:50,658
He became the mascot of our show with just two appearances.

414
00:17:50,758 --> 00:17:53,398
He's the master of sports massage, Mr Kim Young Joon.

415
00:17:53,398 --> 00:17:54,858
What are you talking about?

416
00:17:54,858 --> 00:17:56,358
(Are you kidding me?)

417
00:17:56,358 --> 00:17:58,358
- Are you kidding me? - Are you serious?

418
00:17:58,358 --> 00:17:59,398
What do you think you're doing?

419
00:17:59,398 --> 00:18:01,128
(Why you little...)

420
00:18:01,928 --> 00:18:03,858
This is nonsense.

421
00:18:03,858 --> 00:18:04,858
Are you...

422
00:18:05,068 --> 00:18:07,128
Are you serious?

423
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,128
I have a feeling...

424
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,068
everything's going to lead up to the massage.

425
00:18:10,068 --> 00:18:11,658
He's our mascot?

426
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:12,658
(The mascot is ready.)

427
00:18:12,828 --> 00:18:14,858
- I'll go. - Can you do me a favour?

428
00:18:14,858 --> 00:18:16,128
(Jong Kook volunteers to go first in order to succeed the mission.)

429
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:17,298
This is impossible.

430
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,528
I can't hold it in.

431
00:18:19,328 --> 00:18:20,698
Can you try some other time if you're not feeling up for it?

432
00:18:20,698 --> 00:18:22,858
Let's win the laptop for Gary.

433
00:18:22,858 --> 00:18:23,898
I really need it.

434
00:18:25,068 --> 00:18:29,068
(Will Jong Kook be able to endure the massive pain for Gary?)

435
00:18:29,068 --> 00:18:30,758
Ready, set, go!

436
00:18:30,758 --> 00:18:32,328
(The mascot's massage begins.)

437
00:18:32,928 --> 00:18:33,928
(He seems to be in pain.)

438
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,328
Look at his hands.

439
00:18:35,328 --> 00:18:37,068
Look at those muscles.

440
00:18:37,068 --> 00:18:38,428
(He's trying his best to hold it in.)

441
00:18:39,068 --> 00:18:40,128
Look at his legs.

442
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:41,958
Mission successful.

443
00:18:44,698 --> 00:18:46,598
- Where are you going? - Where are you going?

444
00:18:46,598 --> 00:18:47,828
(He steals something while faking the pain.)

445
00:18:48,198 --> 00:18:49,798
Where are you going?

446
00:18:50,068 --> 00:18:51,068
Where is he going?

447
00:18:51,928 --> 00:18:53,298
(He managed to steal something in the middle of all that.)

448
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,758
Where did he go?

449
00:18:55,358 --> 00:18:58,198
(He arrives at the headquarters on the 4th floor.)

450
00:19:02,928 --> 00:19:05,598
You have successfully carried out the hidden mission.

451
00:19:05,658 --> 00:19:06,658
(Jong Kook managed to steal a toy by acting.)

452
00:19:07,428 --> 00:19:09,828
(The rest of the members have to steal objects bigger than that.)

453
00:19:09,828 --> 00:19:10,928
It hurts so much.

454
00:19:10,928 --> 00:19:13,128
(The rest of the members have to steal objects bigger than that.)

455
00:19:13,128 --> 00:19:15,528
- I'm going to put my palms on you. - You have to endure it, Haha.

456
00:19:15,528 --> 00:19:16,568
Go!

457
00:19:16,568 --> 00:19:17,568
(Haha is up next.)

458
00:19:17,568 --> 00:19:19,898
There you go, Haha.

459
00:19:20,068 --> 00:19:22,298
- You're almost there. - Oh, my.

460
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,068
- Look how ugly he is. - You're almost there.

461
00:19:24,068 --> 00:19:25,198
(Ugliness alert.)

462
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:27,358
And you called me ugly for all these seven years.

463
00:19:27,358 --> 00:19:28,398
Mission successful.

464
00:19:28,398 --> 00:19:29,568
(Haha succeeds.)

465
00:19:30,228 --> 00:19:31,928
- Where are you going? - Where are you going?

466
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,228
Where is everyone going?

467
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:36,698
It hurts so much.

468
00:19:37,128 --> 00:19:38,128
(He arrives at the headquarters.)

469
00:19:38,128 --> 00:19:39,658
- Hello, Haha. - I didn't know it was that big.

470
00:19:40,928 --> 00:19:43,428
That's the object Jong Kook brought.

471
00:19:43,428 --> 00:19:44,858
Why is it so big?

472
00:19:44,858 --> 00:19:47,258
That's too small. You have failed the hidden mission.

473
00:19:47,258 --> 00:19:50,028
- Please bring something else. - But how?

474
00:19:50,028 --> 00:19:51,228
(How did you do that, Jong Kook?)

475
00:19:51,828 --> 00:19:53,358
Where's everyone going?

476
00:19:53,928 --> 00:19:56,228
- It hurts so much. - I guess it's that painful.

477
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,228
It really hurts.

478
00:19:57,228 --> 00:19:58,298
(Ji Hyo tries next.)

479
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:00,568
What was that?

480
00:20:00,568 --> 00:20:01,568
Don't forget you're a celebrity.

481
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:04,328
(What was that gesture just now?)

482
00:20:04,428 --> 00:20:06,068
- What are you doing? - Control yourself.

483
00:20:06,068 --> 00:20:07,328
- Are you crazy? - She's gone out of her mind.

484
00:20:07,328 --> 00:20:08,958
(She gets sent off by disorderly conduct charges.)

485
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:09,958
Are you crazy?

486
00:20:10,358 --> 00:20:11,598
- What was that? - Why did you do that?

487
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,068
Why did you do that?

488
00:20:13,698 --> 00:20:15,258
- What are you doing? - Are you crazy?

489
00:20:15,258 --> 00:20:17,328
- Why did you do that? - Are you out of your mind?

490
00:20:17,328 --> 00:20:19,928
- What was that? - She's gone mad.

491
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:21,428
- She's out of her mind. - What's wrong with everyone today?

492
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,458
(What's wrong with her?)

493
00:20:23,228 --> 00:20:24,228
Get it together.

494
00:20:24,228 --> 00:20:25,958
We should run her through a dope test.

495
00:20:26,598 --> 00:20:27,658
Sit down.

496
00:20:27,658 --> 00:20:29,228
- I wanted to go. - Everyone's gone mad.

497
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,828
I think I can endure the pain.

498
00:20:30,828 --> 00:20:32,658
- I'll try really hard. - Give it a try.

499
00:20:32,658 --> 00:20:34,458
- Okay. - Can I put something in my mouth?

500
00:20:34,658 --> 00:20:36,428
You can't do that.

501
00:20:36,858 --> 00:20:38,098
Ready.

502
00:20:38,128 --> 00:20:39,958
It's 10 seconds. Set...

503
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,158
Can someone else go first?

504
00:20:42,198 --> 00:20:43,458
(He didn't even get started and is already in pain.)

505
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,598
- Man up. - He didn't even get started.

506
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,928
- Ready, - I didn't even get started.

507
00:20:47,928 --> 00:20:49,458
set, go!

508
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,458
(Seok Jin gives it a try.)

509
00:20:51,798 --> 00:20:52,998
There you go.

510
00:20:53,498 --> 00:20:55,198
(Whimpering)

511
00:20:55,398 --> 00:20:57,498
- He just made a sound. - You failed.

512
00:20:57,498 --> 00:21:00,358
That's too harsh.

513
00:21:00,428 --> 00:21:01,498
You failed.

514
00:21:01,498 --> 00:21:03,598
(I guess I'll just buy my own laptop.)

515
00:21:04,028 --> 00:21:05,228
Seok Jin has failed the mission.

516
00:21:05,228 --> 00:21:08,228
(Seok Jin lets out a groan and they fail the game.)

517
00:21:08,428 --> 00:21:09,658
The next prize is highest quality of Korean beef.

518
00:21:09,758 --> 00:21:12,228
- Gary loves meat. - Korean beef isn't bad.

519
00:21:12,428 --> 00:21:15,328
We should pick more carefully. I don't want that person again.

520
00:21:15,328 --> 00:21:16,458
I think we're safe now.

521
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,528
I doubt he's going to be in the next game.

522
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,298
Let's do "Staff Members".

523
00:21:20,358 --> 00:21:22,398
- Okay. - Let's do that.

524
00:21:22,398 --> 00:21:23,958
- Please turn it over. - Is it him again?

525
00:21:24,258 --> 00:21:25,328
I doubt it.

526
00:21:26,398 --> 00:21:27,498
- "Writers"? - "Writers".

527
00:21:28,828 --> 00:21:30,068
It's a different one.

528
00:21:30,068 --> 00:21:31,298
(That's such a relief.)

529
00:21:31,298 --> 00:21:34,598
The keyword for this game of 77,000km is "Writers".

530
00:21:34,598 --> 00:21:36,828
(Is it a game against the writers?)

531
00:21:37,498 --> 00:21:40,328
The writers arranged a sports massage session.

532
00:21:40,858 --> 00:21:43,758
(It's a game of extreme pain again.)

533
00:21:43,758 --> 00:21:44,928
I told you.

534
00:21:45,568 --> 00:21:48,028
- I knew this would happen. - Are you kidding me?

535
00:21:48,028 --> 00:21:49,428
(This just in. The massage therapist joins Running Man as a new member.)

536
00:21:49,428 --> 00:21:51,558
You should just take a seat with us.

537
00:21:51,928 --> 00:21:53,458
Come sit over here.

538
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,328
I told you this would happen.

539
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:57,698
This is Gary's last day.

540
00:21:57,698 --> 00:22:00,028
Can't you just let me go in peace?

541
00:22:00,398 --> 00:22:02,198
This is too harsh.

542
00:22:02,398 --> 00:22:04,458
Wait, nobody got finger flicked for the second mission.

543
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,058
Why would you bring that up? You can go if you'd like.

544
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,298
(Do you want to get your forehead checked out?)

545
00:22:07,298 --> 00:22:10,498
Gary's person of choice will get finger flicked.

546
00:22:10,498 --> 00:22:12,158
Can't we just decide by rock-paper-scissors?

547
00:22:12,158 --> 00:22:14,898
I'll pick Ji Hyo.

548
00:22:15,058 --> 00:22:16,058
Ji Hyo?

549
00:22:17,058 --> 00:22:18,498
- Sounds good. - It's about time.

550
00:22:18,498 --> 00:22:19,498
(It's better to get it over with as early as possible.)

551
00:22:19,498 --> 00:22:20,558
Ji Hyo has a big forehead.

552
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:22,558
It's better to just get it over with.

553
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:24,028
Ji Hyo is good at taking it.

554
00:22:24,028 --> 00:22:26,098
Ji Hyo's forehead is as big as a newly developed town.

555
00:22:26,328 --> 00:22:28,258
- Her forehead is big. - Let Kwang Soo do the honour.

556
00:22:28,258 --> 00:22:29,298
Okay.

557
00:22:29,428 --> 00:22:30,458
Me?

558
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:31,758
(Kwang Soo is the best person fit for the job.)

559
00:22:31,758 --> 00:22:33,158
Just know that you're going next,

560
00:22:33,598 --> 00:22:35,228
and I'll be the one to hit you.

561
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:37,798
- That's fine. - Fine by me.

562
00:22:38,298 --> 00:22:39,298
Okay.

563
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:41,598
I'll knock you out so you won't ever get back up.

564
00:22:41,928 --> 00:22:43,198
- You won't be able to hit me. - That's the spirit.

565
00:22:43,698 --> 00:22:44,828
There you go.

566
00:22:44,828 --> 00:22:47,398
(It's a battle of finger flicks between Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo.)

567
00:22:47,398 --> 00:22:49,258
His hand is bigger than her face.

568
00:22:50,658 --> 00:22:52,158
I'm sorry, Ji Hyo.

569
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:53,458
Just do it.

570
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:54,558
(It's a hit.)

571
00:22:55,698 --> 00:22:57,228
(He high-fived her forehead.)

572
00:22:57,328 --> 00:22:59,458
That looked hilarious, Ji Hyo.

573
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:00,758
I'm sorry, Ji Hyo.

574
00:23:00,758 --> 00:23:02,498
- I couldn't help it. - It'll look funny on television.

575
00:23:02,498 --> 00:23:04,628
- Are you okay, Ji Hyo? - I couldn't help it.

576
00:23:04,858 --> 00:23:07,158
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.

577
00:23:07,158 --> 00:23:08,298
I understand.

578
00:23:08,298 --> 00:23:09,558
I see how it is.

579
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:11,228
- We have to succeed. - I get it.

580
00:23:11,798 --> 00:23:12,928
I'm begging you.

581
00:23:12,928 --> 00:23:14,028
(We have to put an end to this.)

582
00:23:14,858 --> 00:23:16,558
Who's next?

583
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:18,558
- Did you get your waist massaged? - I'll take the massage.

584
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:20,358
I'm so scared.

585
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:22,158
(I need the teddy bear by my side.)

586
00:23:22,158 --> 00:23:23,858
- I'm so scared. - How old are you?

587
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:25,658
- I'm too scared. - Look at him.

588
00:23:25,658 --> 00:23:27,958
- Don't do this. - Let go of me. I'm scared.

589
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,758
- What are you doing? - Let go of me.

590
00:23:29,758 --> 00:23:31,928
- Hand it over. - Goodness.

591
00:23:31,928 --> 00:23:33,698
You don't need to hold on to that.

592
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:36,228
Can you give it back? I'm so scared.

593
00:23:36,228 --> 00:23:38,258
I'll be by your side.

594
00:23:38,428 --> 00:23:39,458
Do you feel better now?

595
00:23:39,598 --> 00:23:41,558
- A giraffe is here. - He's better than a teddy bear.

596
00:23:41,698 --> 00:23:42,798
A giraffe is better.

597
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:45,428
Ready, set, go!

598
00:23:46,028 --> 00:23:48,128
(Haha is holding onto Kwang Soo.)

599
00:23:48,658 --> 00:23:51,758
(Let's do this for Gary and his Korean beef.)

600
00:23:52,228 --> 00:23:53,798
(It's painful.)

601
00:23:54,158 --> 00:23:55,258
Haha didn't make it, either.

602
00:23:55,598 --> 00:23:56,728
He failed.

603
00:23:58,358 --> 00:24:00,458
How come you can't tolerate it?

604
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:02,828
(Sorry, Gary. I tried.)

605
00:24:03,758 --> 00:24:05,928
It's a perfect forehead to hit because it's flat.

606
00:24:05,928 --> 00:24:07,728
This is a great forehead to hit.

607
00:24:08,128 --> 00:24:09,158
- I'll go like this. - Okay.

608
00:24:09,528 --> 00:24:10,858
Her temper is...

609
00:24:13,128 --> 00:24:14,528
(She slaps hard.)

610
00:24:15,298 --> 00:24:17,198
(His skull might be split.)

611
00:24:18,628 --> 00:24:20,228
You were in the air for a moment.

612
00:24:20,928 --> 00:24:24,658
(This smashing makes him go against gravity.)

613
00:24:24,928 --> 00:24:26,258
I knew she would smash him.

614
00:24:26,758 --> 00:24:28,198
You are really good at hitting.

615
00:24:29,728 --> 00:24:31,258
It's not easy to hit like that.

616
00:24:31,258 --> 00:24:33,128
She's frightening.

617
00:24:33,128 --> 00:24:34,228
That was strong.

618
00:24:35,028 --> 00:24:37,698
Jae Seok, why are you taking this?

619
00:24:37,898 --> 00:24:40,298
Let go of this bear.

620
00:24:40,328 --> 00:24:41,698
Haha, come back.

621
00:24:41,828 --> 00:24:43,258
- She was not kidding. - We have to shoot.

622
00:24:43,428 --> 00:24:45,328
- I can't believe it. - You come here, too.

623
00:24:45,728 --> 00:24:47,028
Wait a second.

624
00:24:47,358 --> 00:24:48,598
Go over there.

625
00:24:48,598 --> 00:24:50,398
(They're stopping each other.)

626
00:24:50,398 --> 00:24:51,858
- This is unbelievable. - Kwang Soo, come here.

627
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:54,058
- You tried three times so far. - Yes.

628
00:24:54,498 --> 00:24:56,458
Please choose the next challenge.

629
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:58,798
- Let's choose 50,000km. - We'll pick 50,000km.

630
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:00,358
- 50,000km. - Isn't it the therapist again?

631
00:25:00,358 --> 00:25:01,528
Let's choose 30,000km.

632
00:25:01,528 --> 00:25:02,728
- Is it a notebook, then? - 70,000km...

633
00:25:02,728 --> 00:25:04,398
- 50,000 and a pass of everyone. - Shall we shake the shoes off?

634
00:25:04,398 --> 00:25:07,058
- 50,000... - And a pass of everyone.

635
00:25:07,058 --> 00:25:08,128
Turn that around, please.

636
00:25:09,828 --> 00:25:11,628
("Hit or Miss")

637
00:25:11,628 --> 00:25:13,558
- It's "Hit or Miss". - That's good.

638
00:25:13,698 --> 00:25:14,958
- This is good. - I like it.

639
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:16,528
- Great. - We can manage this.

640
00:25:16,528 --> 00:25:18,498
We can do this.

641
00:25:18,498 --> 00:25:21,598
The game for 50,000km is...

642
00:25:21,828 --> 00:25:24,028
"Hit or Miss".

643
00:25:24,128 --> 00:25:25,728
"Hit or Miss" is not bad.

644
00:25:25,728 --> 00:25:27,358
- It depends on the luck. - Right.

645
00:25:27,828 --> 00:25:29,058
What will it be?

646
00:25:29,058 --> 00:25:30,758
(Suspicious plates are coming in.)

647
00:25:30,858 --> 00:25:33,098
I think these are foods that contain wasabi or something.

648
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:34,798
- They might be. - Are they dumplings?

649
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:37,258
- They look like foods, right? - We need to pass this.

650
00:25:37,398 --> 00:25:39,028
- Jae Seok, - Jae Seok.

651
00:25:39,028 --> 00:25:40,298
- come here and look at these. - Jae Seok.

652
00:25:40,298 --> 00:25:41,658
- Over here. - Jae Seok.

653
00:25:41,658 --> 00:25:43,758
- I'm going to the restroom. - The restroom is that way.

654
00:25:46,158 --> 00:25:47,798
(He heads for the restroom...)

655
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:49,928
(but suddenly starts to crawl.)

656
00:25:51,158 --> 00:25:53,358
(He bumps into the staff.)

657
00:25:54,898 --> 00:25:56,728
(He steals something.)

658
00:25:58,358 --> 00:26:01,528
(He acquired the frame among the staff.)

659
00:26:03,698 --> 00:26:05,028
- Hello. - Hello.

660
00:26:06,758 --> 00:26:09,858
This should be bigger than Jong Kook's item over there.

661
00:26:09,858 --> 00:26:11,128
It's bigger, isn't it?

662
00:26:11,898 --> 00:26:14,158
(The frame is slightly bigger than the figurine.)

663
00:26:14,158 --> 00:26:16,958
Jae Seok, your secret mission is cleared.

664
00:26:16,958 --> 00:26:20,098
(Jae Seok is the 2nd one to clear the secret mission.)

665
00:26:20,758 --> 00:26:22,858
- Let me explain the rule. - Okay.

666
00:26:22,898 --> 00:26:25,828
The game of 50,000km is " Hit or Miss".

667
00:26:25,828 --> 00:26:29,858
The mission will be cleared if everyone passes.

668
00:26:30,098 --> 00:26:34,098
There are seven levels of them. So you should think about the order.

669
00:26:35,658 --> 00:26:37,198
It's obvious.

670
00:26:37,258 --> 00:26:39,228
- It's coke. - Okay.

671
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:41,228
- Next. - Great.

672
00:26:42,358 --> 00:26:43,398
It'll be difficult from now on.

673
00:26:44,098 --> 00:26:45,528
- I can't distinguish them. - I can't, either.

674
00:26:45,998 --> 00:26:47,398
I hate this.

675
00:26:47,628 --> 00:26:49,158
I even hate regular yogurt, too.

676
00:26:49,158 --> 00:26:51,128
- Why? - For it contains too much sugar.

677
00:26:51,128 --> 00:26:52,398
Just drink it.

678
00:26:52,898 --> 00:26:54,798
- Gosh. - What is the other one?

679
00:26:55,558 --> 00:26:56,698
(He is very cautious.)

680
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:57,798
This one is yogurt.

681
00:26:57,928 --> 00:26:59,428
This one is real. The colour of that one is too light.

682
00:26:59,428 --> 00:27:01,058
(He's hesitating for several minutes.)

683
00:27:02,498 --> 00:27:06,798
- It's the colour of real yogurt. - Okay.

684
00:27:06,928 --> 00:27:08,098
(He finally picks one.)

685
00:27:08,098 --> 00:27:09,328
- I think this is... - Here he goes.

686
00:27:09,358 --> 00:27:10,928
- He's drinking. - This looks real.

687
00:27:11,728 --> 00:27:17,128
(We didn't deduct the distance at all. We have to succeed.)

688
00:27:18,698 --> 00:27:19,798
(He's drinking it very well.)

689
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:21,328
It looks okay. Are you okay?

690
00:27:22,128 --> 00:27:24,128
(He finishes in one go.)

691
00:27:25,198 --> 00:27:26,298
It's delicious.

692
00:27:27,328 --> 00:27:28,498
I smell vinegar.

693
00:27:29,498 --> 00:27:30,928
(He tried to hide it but failed.)

694
00:27:30,928 --> 00:27:32,198
My goodness.

695
00:27:32,198 --> 00:27:33,398
The other was the real one.

696
00:27:34,098 --> 00:27:35,558
He smells of vinegar a lot.

697
00:27:35,558 --> 00:27:36,658
We were right.

698
00:27:36,658 --> 00:27:38,528
You picked the wrong one.

699
00:27:38,528 --> 00:27:39,998
You recommended this.

700
00:27:40,598 --> 00:27:42,058
(Sneakily)

701
00:27:42,858 --> 00:27:45,428
(The hunters start to move again.)

702
00:27:45,828 --> 00:27:46,828
You still smell like vinegar.

703
00:27:47,158 --> 00:27:51,058
(They hide the stolen item under their shirts.)

704
00:27:52,258 --> 00:27:54,758
Gosh. You're so mean.

705
00:27:54,758 --> 00:27:55,958
You put too much of wasabi.

706
00:27:56,928 --> 00:27:58,498
Have you given us these kind of foods?

707
00:27:58,728 --> 00:27:59,728
You could have put just a little.

708
00:27:59,728 --> 00:28:01,398
Is this what we used to eat?

709
00:28:01,398 --> 00:28:02,458
What are you doing, Seok Jin?

710
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:04,858
That explains why my family said they hated my smell.

711
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:08,258
It's a failure. We'll clean them up.

712
00:28:08,258 --> 00:28:09,558
(Haha hid the frame under his shirt.)

713
00:28:09,558 --> 00:28:10,698
(I need to go downstairs.)

714
00:28:10,698 --> 00:28:12,558
I should have made a better choice.

715
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:15,328
The next step would have been a raw egg.

716
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,298
What is this?

717
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:22,458
(He comes out of the room.)

718
00:28:23,098 --> 00:28:26,098
(Great. I looked natural.)

719
00:28:26,228 --> 00:28:27,928
Nobody noticed this.

720
00:28:28,428 --> 00:28:30,098
This is Jae Seok's item.

721
00:28:30,098 --> 00:28:32,398
- When did he bring it? - This is the new standard.

722
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:33,398
(When did he bring that?)

723
00:28:33,398 --> 00:28:35,298
- Haha, you cleared the mission. - Yes.

724
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:38,328
(Haha cleared the secret mission.)

725
00:28:38,828 --> 00:28:41,558
I think Gary will have to give gifts to 100 people.

726
00:28:42,058 --> 00:28:44,958
Gary might give apples again to 100 staff members.

727
00:28:44,958 --> 00:28:46,428
(They keep searching for items.)

728
00:28:46,428 --> 00:28:48,558
Is this what you can wear?

729
00:28:49,128 --> 00:28:50,258
Are you going to study English?

730
00:28:50,258 --> 00:28:51,258
(Gary doesn't notice anything.)

731
00:28:51,258 --> 00:28:53,728
- I'm looking around. - Why don't you learn from Mike?

732
00:28:54,658 --> 00:29:00,128
(Seok Jin sneaks out of the room.)

733
00:29:00,598 --> 00:29:03,658
You should bring something definitely bigger than this.

734
00:29:05,898 --> 00:29:08,058
(Why is his belly bulging?)

735
00:29:08,758 --> 00:29:10,198
I'm worried about the next person.

736
00:29:12,428 --> 00:29:15,098
(He brought a big one.)

737
00:29:15,098 --> 00:29:16,098
What should the next person do?

738
00:29:16,198 --> 00:29:18,458
- It should be wider, too. - Wider, too?

739
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:20,828
This is what Haha brought.

740
00:29:20,958 --> 00:29:23,258
- Should it be wider, too? - It should be obviously bigger.

741
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:24,998
- I thought the height is important. - We measure...

742
00:29:24,998 --> 00:29:27,128
We measure the width, too.

743
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:28,428
The opinion of the staff is...

744
00:29:28,428 --> 00:29:30,358
(He brought a huge one.)

745
00:29:30,658 --> 00:29:31,728
Did you bring this?

746
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:32,758
(This is big enough to cover any frame.)

747
00:29:32,758 --> 00:29:33,758
Hey, you.

748
00:29:33,758 --> 00:29:35,198
Don't you think of the rest of us?

749
00:29:36,428 --> 00:29:38,198
Compare them.

750
00:29:38,498 --> 00:29:40,498
- You should think... - It can cover this.

751
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:41,958
Kwang Soo, you cleared the secret mission.

752
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:44,258
(Kwang Soo's ability to steal is amazing.)

753
00:29:44,258 --> 00:29:45,598
Are you crazy?

754
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:47,758
How could you bring this one?

755
00:29:47,758 --> 00:29:50,898
Now, Kwang Soo's item is the standard.

756
00:29:51,658 --> 00:29:52,828
How can I bring anything bigger than this?

757
00:29:53,628 --> 00:29:57,458
(Ji Hyo and Seok Jin are the ones left.)

758
00:29:58,228 --> 00:29:59,598
(It's getting harder for the two.)

759
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:01,958
- Shall we start? - Let's start shooting again.

760
00:30:02,428 --> 00:30:04,558
- Let's do "Hit or Miss" once more. - Good.

761
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:05,928
- Okay. - Let's do it.

762
00:30:06,028 --> 00:30:07,428
Before that, someone has to get finger flicked.

763
00:30:07,428 --> 00:30:08,658
(You should get finger flicked.)

764
00:30:08,658 --> 00:30:10,528
- Can I appoint someone? - Yes, you can.

765
00:30:10,528 --> 00:30:11,898
It's been a while since Jong Kook got it last time.

766
00:30:11,898 --> 00:30:15,058
(Jong Kook, could you come up?)

767
00:30:15,158 --> 00:30:16,198
It sounds good.

768
00:30:16,528 --> 00:30:17,858
The sound is great.

769
00:30:18,028 --> 00:30:20,598
- Who can hit him? - He still has to be hit.

770
00:30:20,628 --> 00:30:22,428
(I'll see how hard you hit me.)

771
00:30:22,428 --> 00:30:25,258
Ji Hyo is doing well today. What about her?

772
00:30:25,258 --> 00:30:27,158
- Okay. - Ji Hyo is great.

773
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,028
- I can't since I'm busy. - What about Kwang Soo?

774
00:30:29,398 --> 00:30:31,528
- Let Kwang Soo hit him. - May I?

775
00:30:32,128 --> 00:30:35,358
Jae Seok is really good at slapping.

776
00:30:35,358 --> 00:30:36,458
- It's okay. - Can I?

777
00:30:36,698 --> 00:30:38,558
Are you worried about next time?

778
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:39,928
I feel sorry.

779
00:30:40,098 --> 00:30:41,458
- We're worried. - That's why.

780
00:30:42,058 --> 00:30:43,058
Then...

781
00:30:43,058 --> 00:30:44,828
- let's play rock-paper-scissors. - I want to appoint...

782
00:30:44,828 --> 00:30:46,028
- someone. - Let's play...

783
00:30:46,028 --> 00:30:47,198
rock-paper-scissors.

784
00:30:47,198 --> 00:30:48,828
- No. - If you appoint someone...

785
00:30:49,358 --> 00:30:51,558
- I can appoint someone who'll slap. - No.

786
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:54,058
You just appointed the one who will be slapped.

787
00:30:54,058 --> 00:30:56,198
(Is she cleaning up for me?)

788
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:58,558
- You mean I should hit him? - Yes.

789
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,958
(Well, then...)

790
00:31:00,958 --> 00:31:02,098
Then I want to hit you.

791
00:31:02,098 --> 00:31:04,158
(I just want to hit you.)

792
00:31:04,158 --> 00:31:05,258
Why?

793
00:31:05,858 --> 00:31:08,158
Then let's play rock-paper-scissors among the rest of us.

794
00:31:08,428 --> 00:31:10,128
- Among the rest? - The loser will hit him.

795
00:31:10,128 --> 00:31:11,758
People who didn't hit yet has to play it.

796
00:31:11,758 --> 00:31:13,498
- The loser is the hitter. - Okay.

797
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:14,558
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

798
00:31:16,998 --> 00:31:18,158
Okay.

799
00:31:18,158 --> 00:31:21,358
(Haha has to hit Jong Kook's forehead.)

800
00:31:22,928 --> 00:31:24,128
He's good at this.

801
00:31:24,128 --> 00:31:26,158
- He is. - He shouldn't get hurt.

802
00:31:26,158 --> 00:31:27,528
He won't get hurt.

803
00:31:27,528 --> 00:31:30,128
He has to perform in Vegas.

804
00:31:30,128 --> 00:31:32,058
You mean the concert in Las Vegas?

805
00:31:32,428 --> 00:31:33,958
- The concert in Las Vegas? - Yes.

806
00:31:34,758 --> 00:31:36,458
- On November 19? - Yes.

807
00:31:37,598 --> 00:31:38,728
(He promotes his concert suddenly.)

808
00:31:38,728 --> 00:31:40,558
- What are you doing? - This won't be aired.

809
00:31:40,658 --> 00:31:42,758
What's wrong with mentioning my concert?

810
00:31:43,028 --> 00:31:44,558
Leave your hand mark.

811
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:46,028
(He has to slap Jong Kook anyway.)

812
00:31:46,028 --> 00:31:47,098
It's okay to get slapped in the face.

813
00:31:48,128 --> 00:31:51,528
But he hits the eyes. He can't aim properly.

814
00:31:52,358 --> 00:31:53,828
(Slapping)

815
00:31:55,328 --> 00:31:57,058
See? He hits the eyes.

816
00:31:58,858 --> 00:32:00,428
He usually hits the eyes.

817
00:32:00,428 --> 00:32:01,998
I was hit by the eyes last time.

818
00:32:02,328 --> 00:32:03,758
He can't aim well.

819
00:32:03,758 --> 00:32:05,058
You should have adjusted the spot.

820
00:32:05,628 --> 00:32:07,358
(Just think about the concert, Jong Kook.)

821
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:08,498
This is funny.

822
00:32:08,998 --> 00:32:10,328
The next person is doomed.

823
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:14,128
I don't feel confident about this.

824
00:32:14,128 --> 00:32:15,128
(Seok Jin is trying a new game.)

825
00:32:15,128 --> 00:32:16,198
I'll put them anywhere.

826
00:32:16,198 --> 00:32:17,328
- As many as possible. - Oh my.

827
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:19,558
(It pops out.)

828
00:32:20,698 --> 00:32:22,858
(Seok Jin sure is unlucky.)

829
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:25,158
- I'm sorry. - You're so bad at games.

830
00:32:25,358 --> 00:32:26,428
Sit down.

831
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:29,058
(Are you talking to me?)

832
00:32:29,058 --> 00:32:30,158
Is it me?

833
00:32:31,198 --> 00:32:32,628
He must be scared.

834
00:32:32,628 --> 00:32:33,928
You could have said nicely.

835
00:32:33,928 --> 00:32:35,998
You should have said nicely.

836
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:38,758
He ordered him to sit down.

837
00:32:39,698 --> 00:32:41,858
- Hit me within three seconds. - Okay.

838
00:32:41,858 --> 00:32:43,698
- I'll hold you. - Gosh.

839
00:32:45,228 --> 00:32:46,428
Does it have to be me?

840
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,528
It was Haha who hit you.

841
00:32:48,528 --> 00:32:49,798
I can't hit Haha...

842
00:32:49,798 --> 00:32:53,998
because we'll perform in Las Vegas.

843
00:32:54,428 --> 00:32:56,928
It is on November 19, isn't it?

844
00:32:58,258 --> 00:32:59,928
(You know it very well.)

845
00:32:59,928 --> 00:33:01,298
- Give me a break. - Get up.

846
00:33:01,298 --> 00:33:02,698
- Okay. - Come over here.

847
00:33:02,698 --> 00:33:04,598
(He wants Jae Seok instead.)

848
00:33:05,428 --> 00:33:07,458
- This is not fair. - It's not.

849
00:33:08,058 --> 00:33:10,058
- It's not fair at all. - Sit down.

850
00:33:10,858 --> 00:33:12,828
What a relief.

851
00:33:12,828 --> 00:33:14,898
- I'm dumbfounded. - Words saved him.

852
00:33:14,898 --> 00:33:16,858
- I'm at a loss. - Words are important.

853
00:33:16,858 --> 00:33:18,898
I'm at a loss for words.

854
00:33:19,158 --> 00:33:20,658
- You can't do this. - Sit down.

855
00:33:20,658 --> 00:33:22,198
(Though he's upset, he reveals his forehead.)

856
00:33:22,428 --> 00:33:24,658
- Take off your glasses. - I heard you have guests, too.

857
00:33:25,698 --> 00:33:26,758
Goodness.

858
00:33:26,758 --> 00:33:28,328
They're Turbo and Skull, right?

859
00:33:28,328 --> 00:33:29,328
Get up.

860
00:33:29,328 --> 00:33:31,328
(Correct. Get up.)

861
00:33:32,498 --> 00:33:34,358
(Kwang Soo, come here.)

862
00:33:34,358 --> 00:33:35,358
Me?

863
00:33:35,358 --> 00:33:37,398
- I was hit just a moment ago. - Sit down.

864
00:33:37,458 --> 00:33:39,298
- Isn't it too soon? - No.

865
00:33:39,358 --> 00:33:41,928
- He can't cancel his decision. - Sit up straight.

866
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:43,458
Sit up straight.

867
00:33:44,698 --> 00:33:46,758
Put your knees together.

868
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,158
(He got high-quality information.)

869
00:33:48,358 --> 00:33:50,528
Isn't she lovely

870
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:51,798
What's that?

871
00:33:51,898 --> 00:33:52,928
Why did you sing that?

872
00:33:53,098 --> 00:33:54,558
Isn't Stevie Wonder also invited?

873
00:33:55,128 --> 00:33:57,098
- Get ready. - What?

874
00:33:57,298 --> 00:33:59,198
- You said Stevie Wonder is coming. - When?

875
00:33:59,198 --> 00:34:01,528
- You said so. - That's nonsense.

876
00:34:01,528 --> 00:34:03,958
- Kwang Soo is a fraud. - He said Stevie Wonder is coming.

877
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,898
He's a fraud.

878
00:34:06,028 --> 00:34:08,468
Haha said Stevie Wonder is invited to the performance.

879
00:34:08,468 --> 00:34:10,398
- Gary told you that. - It was Gary.

880
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:11,898
Gary has no idea about the performance.

881
00:34:11,898 --> 00:34:13,628
I didn't know, either.

882
00:34:13,628 --> 00:34:14,998
I thought Haha whispered to me.

883
00:34:14,998 --> 00:34:17,158
- It was a fraud. - Gary wants to see Stevie Wonder.

884
00:34:17,158 --> 00:34:18,498
You lost my trust.

885
00:34:18,498 --> 00:34:20,158
Get ready and lift your chin.

886
00:34:20,528 --> 00:34:22,498
Lift your chin and clench your jaws.

887
00:34:22,498 --> 00:34:25,098
He resembles the mascot of a baseball team.

888
00:34:25,468 --> 00:34:26,628
(Discovery of a new character)

889
00:34:26,628 --> 00:34:27,898
What did you say?

890
00:34:27,928 --> 00:34:29,728
I don't look like a mascot.

891
00:34:29,728 --> 00:34:32,428
- You do. - I don't look like that.

892
00:34:32,828 --> 00:34:35,928
You might get a chance to throw the first ball in the opening game.

893
00:34:35,928 --> 00:34:38,128
I'm sorry, but I'm not a fan of that team.

894
00:34:38,658 --> 00:34:42,498
Even if you aren't, you look like the mascot of that team.

895
00:34:42,498 --> 00:34:44,998
- You can't change your looks. - You look like that mascot.

896
00:34:44,998 --> 00:34:46,898
Get ready, Kwang Soo.

897
00:34:47,098 --> 00:34:48,558
Gosh.

898
00:34:48,558 --> 00:34:50,098
(Kwang Soo is in trouble.)

899
00:34:50,298 --> 00:34:51,628
It's going to hurt a lot.

900
00:34:51,628 --> 00:34:53,198
(Slap)

901
00:34:54,528 --> 00:34:56,598
(He gets thrown to the ground.)

902
00:34:56,698 --> 00:34:58,698
- That was such a hard slap. - Kwang Soo.

903
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:00,158
Kwang Soo.

904
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:02,398
- Is it okay to air this? - Kwang Soo.

905
00:35:02,398 --> 00:35:03,728
Breathe.

906
00:35:04,858 --> 00:35:07,598
His face turned completely red.

907
00:35:07,658 --> 00:35:09,398
(Gary, why did you lie to me?)

908
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,828
Kwang Soo, it's okay.

909
00:35:12,128 --> 00:35:13,468
Let's move on.

910
00:35:13,468 --> 00:35:15,758
- Gosh, nothing is working out. - This is too difficult.

911
00:35:15,758 --> 00:35:17,598
Let's try the category, "Staff Members"

912
00:35:17,598 --> 00:35:19,198
- Okay. - Shall we?

913
00:35:19,198 --> 00:35:21,198
- Let's pick 50,000km. - Okay.

914
00:35:21,528 --> 00:35:23,528
This is "Staff Members" for 50,000km.

915
00:35:23,528 --> 00:35:24,928
"VJ"?

916
00:35:24,928 --> 00:35:26,358
("VJ")

917
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:27,498
What's that?

918
00:35:28,058 --> 00:35:31,428
It'd better not be a massage therapist the VJ picks again.

919
00:35:31,998 --> 00:35:33,658
That means you want to start a war.

920
00:35:33,658 --> 00:35:37,758
The game for 50,000km is a race with the staff.

921
00:35:37,758 --> 00:35:39,358
- A race? - How's that possible?

922
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:41,628
Pick three members from each team.

923
00:35:41,998 --> 00:35:44,558
The 1st runner climbs up from 1st to 5th floor.

924
00:35:44,558 --> 00:35:46,058
The next runner comes down from 5th to 1st floor.

925
00:35:46,058 --> 00:35:47,828
- Gary should run. - From the fifth floor?

926
00:35:47,828 --> 00:35:49,298
We can win this.

927
00:35:49,298 --> 00:35:50,658
This is quite easy.

928
00:35:50,658 --> 00:35:52,528
- Jae Seok should run. - He should.

929
00:35:52,528 --> 00:35:54,198
We might finish this mission.

930
00:35:54,198 --> 00:35:55,468
We have to do more.

931
00:35:55,468 --> 00:35:57,398
Gary can run very fast.

932
00:35:57,398 --> 00:35:59,828
- Gary is redoing his shoelaces. - The three VJ's are...

933
00:35:59,828 --> 00:36:01,698
Kwon Ryeol, Ki Jin and Sung Oh.

934
00:36:01,698 --> 00:36:03,468
- We'll win this one. - We already won.

935
00:36:03,468 --> 00:36:05,728
Are they looking down on us?

936
00:36:05,928 --> 00:36:08,658
Great, this is exactly what Gary needs.

937
00:36:08,658 --> 00:36:11,698
Kwon Ryeol gained a lot of weight.

938
00:36:12,328 --> 00:36:15,528
(It's an elite VJ team that's been with Running Man for 7 years.)

939
00:36:15,528 --> 00:36:18,798
(Who will win the race?)

940
00:36:19,128 --> 00:36:21,358
The 1st runner to start from the 1st floor should go down.

941
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:23,858
Gary will start from the first floor.

942
00:36:23,858 --> 00:36:25,468
- Gary should go. - Do you run both ways?

943
00:36:25,468 --> 00:36:28,058
No, you hand the baton to the second runner...

944
00:36:28,058 --> 00:36:29,828
- on the fifth floor. - Okay.

945
00:36:29,828 --> 00:36:31,198
One runner has to go down.

946
00:36:31,198 --> 00:36:32,468
- Is that so? - Yes.

947
00:36:32,468 --> 00:36:33,968
You two should climb up the stairs.

948
00:36:33,968 --> 00:36:35,998
- I'll climb up. - You can come down.

949
00:36:35,998 --> 00:36:37,528
- I'll go down. - 2 runners stay on the 1st floor.

950
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,828
- Gary should go to the first floor. - Do you have a belt?

951
00:36:39,828 --> 00:36:41,998
The runners go up, down and up.

952
00:36:41,998 --> 00:36:44,058
(Gary leaves to prepare himself for the race.)

953
00:36:45,098 --> 00:36:46,398
I'm not going.

954
00:36:46,628 --> 00:36:48,498
(Here's their chance.)

955
00:36:53,998 --> 00:36:55,358
I had my eye on that.

956
00:36:55,728 --> 00:36:58,158
- It's mine. - Come on.

957
00:36:58,158 --> 00:37:00,198
If you take this, what about the person after you?

958
00:37:00,198 --> 00:37:01,228
You can't take it.

959
00:37:01,228 --> 00:37:02,728
Can you start with the shelves?

960
00:37:03,598 --> 00:37:04,798
What about the poster frame?

961
00:37:04,798 --> 00:37:06,698
(He doesn't have enough strength.)

962
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:09,758
- Who took the photo frame? - You can't carry it.

963
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:11,698
- Haha. - Which photo frame?

964
00:37:12,158 --> 00:37:13,798
Mine was this small.

965
00:37:14,528 --> 00:37:15,858
There's one here.

966
00:37:16,358 --> 00:37:18,158
- Can you get off? - Do it later.

967
00:37:18,258 --> 00:37:20,058
I have to do it now.

968
00:37:20,898 --> 00:37:22,398
You can't carry that.

969
00:37:22,928 --> 00:37:25,128
If she takes the plant, the game is over.

970
00:37:25,228 --> 00:37:27,428
(While the two thieves are fighting with a plant...)

971
00:37:27,428 --> 00:37:28,998
That's too big.

972
00:37:29,158 --> 00:37:31,198
- Shall we practise? - Let's do it once.

973
00:37:31,898 --> 00:37:34,628
(Here comes Gary.)

974
00:37:35,298 --> 00:37:37,468
If she takes the plant, the game is over.

975
00:37:37,468 --> 00:37:38,558
(Gary runs up to the studio.)

976
00:37:38,858 --> 00:37:41,328
(Here I come.)

977
00:37:42,198 --> 00:37:44,358
- It's too big. - Isn't it too big?

978
00:37:44,358 --> 00:37:46,328
It doesn't matter as long as he doesn't see it.

979
00:37:47,858 --> 00:37:49,558
(Ji Hyo steals a big one.)

980
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:51,758
I'll help you on the stairs.

981
00:37:52,058 --> 00:37:55,198
(Ji Hyo is at risk.)

982
00:37:58,898 --> 00:38:00,528
I'll help you. You might hurt yourself.

983
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,558
(Gary is climbing up from 2nd to 3rd floor.)

984
00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:10,298
(Will Gary catch Ji Hyo stealing the plant?)

985
00:38:10,298 --> 00:38:12,928
(Or will she make it safely?)

986
00:38:12,928 --> 00:38:14,158
Over here.

987
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:17,468
(Or will she make it safely?)

988
00:38:19,328 --> 00:38:21,468
(Ji Hyo is entering the office.)

989
00:38:21,468 --> 00:38:25,128
(Will she get caught or steal the plant successfully?)

990
00:38:27,628 --> 00:38:30,258
(Ji Hyo successfully enters.)

991
00:38:30,258 --> 00:38:32,558
(I'm here to register a plant.)

992
00:38:32,558 --> 00:38:34,398
This is good, right?

993
00:38:35,528 --> 00:38:38,728
(Will the plant be bigger than Kwang Soo's item?)

994
00:38:38,728 --> 00:38:39,898
It's bigger, right?

995
00:38:40,928 --> 00:38:43,898
You have successfully carried out the hidden mission.

996
00:38:44,558 --> 00:38:46,498
(She doesn't have to steal any more.)

997
00:38:46,498 --> 00:38:47,658
(She doesn't have to steal any more.)

998
00:38:48,358 --> 00:38:49,758
Am I the only one left?

999
00:38:49,998 --> 00:38:51,258
Really?

1000
00:38:51,398 --> 00:38:52,928
- You can do it. - You can do it.

1001
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:54,968
- Good luck. - You can do it, Gary.

1002
00:38:55,758 --> 00:38:58,158
- You can do it. - Okay.

1003
00:38:58,798 --> 00:39:00,498
Are you ready?

1004
00:39:01,928 --> 00:39:03,158
Are you taking that?

1005
00:39:03,198 --> 00:39:05,698
What are you doing over there?

1006
00:39:05,898 --> 00:39:08,128
- Right now is the time. - Please get ready.

1007
00:39:08,128 --> 00:39:10,258
(He tries to steal the sofa.)

1008
00:39:10,258 --> 00:39:11,498
Are you moving?

1009
00:39:11,498 --> 00:39:14,728
It's because Ji Hyo took a plant.

1010
00:39:14,998 --> 00:39:17,598
- Could you help me? - What are you doing?

1011
00:39:17,698 --> 00:39:20,328
What are you doing when there's a race going on?

1012
00:39:21,298 --> 00:39:23,928
I have to do it before Gary comes up.

1013
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:26,058
Can you carry it downstairs?

1014
00:39:26,228 --> 00:39:28,758
Why did you take a plant?

1015
00:39:28,758 --> 00:39:30,058
Get ready.

1016
00:39:30,058 --> 00:39:32,358
Gary is about to start the race.

1017
00:39:32,468 --> 00:39:34,898
- You can't go downstairs. - The race is about to start.

1018
00:39:34,898 --> 00:39:37,258
(What's happening on the 1st floor?)

1019
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:39,658
(The first VJ Team member is on standby.)

1020
00:39:39,968 --> 00:39:41,358
He's good at running.

1021
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:43,398
- Get ready, VJ Team. - I'm ready.

1022
00:39:43,468 --> 00:39:45,858
- Take it easy. Don't try too hard. - Start.

1023
00:39:46,858 --> 00:39:47,998
Start.

1024
00:39:47,998 --> 00:39:49,598
(VJ Team's 1st runner starts.)

1025
00:39:49,598 --> 00:39:51,998
We might lose the race.

1026
00:39:51,998 --> 00:39:54,628
(We can't say goodbye to Gary so easily.)

1027
00:39:54,628 --> 00:39:58,398
(He runs fast with 7 years of experience on Running Man.)

1028
00:39:59,128 --> 00:40:01,328
You can't go downstairs now because of the race.

1029
00:40:01,828 --> 00:40:02,858
(Next runner is up.)

1030
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,228
He's fast.

1031
00:40:06,428 --> 00:40:07,828
(They're still trying to steal.)

1032
00:40:07,828 --> 00:40:10,258
What's going on? Goodness.

1033
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,928
- Another runner will come up. - We're having a race.

1034
00:40:12,928 --> 00:40:14,968
Another runner will come up.

1035
00:40:15,228 --> 00:40:18,058
Another runner will come up.

1036
00:40:18,128 --> 00:40:20,528
Someone will be back soon.

1037
00:40:20,528 --> 00:40:22,198
Let's try again.

1038
00:40:22,198 --> 00:40:25,758
(He runs towards the third runner.)

1039
00:40:27,528 --> 00:40:29,298
Just give up, Kwon Ryeol.

1040
00:40:29,628 --> 00:40:31,828
He should have come down much earlier.

1041
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:36,028
(The third runner is up.)

1042
00:40:37,098 --> 00:40:39,058
(The last spurt is the only way to win.)

1043
00:40:39,058 --> 00:40:41,598
Someone is coming upstairs again.

1044
00:40:41,998 --> 00:40:45,558
(He runs with all his might for the finish line.)

1045
00:40:45,558 --> 00:40:46,728
He's coming up.

1046
00:40:47,998 --> 00:40:48,998
He's coming up.

1047
00:40:48,998 --> 00:40:50,298
The record is...

1048
00:40:50,898 --> 00:40:52,758
54.25 seconds.

1049
00:40:52,828 --> 00:40:54,558
- They were fast. - We don't have time.

1050
00:40:55,398 --> 00:40:57,628
- That's impressive. - They were fast.

1051
00:40:57,728 --> 00:40:59,398
(He's in a hurry.)

1052
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:03,698
It was 54.25 seconds. Are we up next?

1053
00:41:04,398 --> 00:41:07,968
(Nothing can stop him now.)

1054
00:41:08,898 --> 00:41:11,298
- The 1st runner climbs up 1st. - Okay.

1055
00:41:11,298 --> 00:41:14,028
- Wait. - Gary is coming upstairs.

1056
00:41:14,858 --> 00:41:18,228
(Will Seok Jin successfully steal the bike?)

1057
00:41:18,228 --> 00:41:19,298
(He can't let Gary find out.)

1058
00:41:19,298 --> 00:41:20,968
- I can't see anything. - This is good.

1059
00:41:20,968 --> 00:41:22,258
Start.

1060
00:41:22,258 --> 00:41:23,758
(He starts.)

1061
00:41:25,028 --> 00:41:27,558
(He's confident about running.)

1062
00:41:27,558 --> 00:41:31,358
(He sprints up the stairs at the speed of light.)

1063
00:41:31,998 --> 00:41:34,428
(3rd floor)

1064
00:41:34,428 --> 00:41:37,558
(On the 4th floor, Seok Jin struggles.)

1065
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,358
(Run away, Gary is coming.)

1066
00:41:42,828 --> 00:41:46,228
(Seok Jin gets startled by the sound.)

1067
00:41:46,698 --> 00:41:48,798
Is Gary coming?

1068
00:41:49,258 --> 00:41:51,028
- Is Gary coming? - Yes.

1069
00:41:51,028 --> 00:41:52,158
Here you go.

1070
00:41:52,298 --> 00:41:53,528
Give it to me.

1071
00:41:53,528 --> 00:41:55,098
(Jong Kook forgets to hand the baton.)

1072
00:41:56,028 --> 00:41:59,398
(Seok Jin was scared to death.)

1073
00:42:00,058 --> 00:42:01,358
It's Jong Kook.

1074
00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:02,698
- It is? - Yes.

1075
00:42:02,698 --> 00:42:06,528
- It was only Jong Kook. - Gary is coming up soon.

1076
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:08,028
Gary is coming.

1077
00:42:09,028 --> 00:42:12,658
(Jae Seok goes down to Gary.)

1078
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:15,228
Here you go.

1079
00:42:16,098 --> 00:42:17,358
(Gary is up.)

1080
00:42:18,698 --> 00:42:20,898
(Gary starts to run.)

1081
00:42:20,898 --> 00:42:23,028
- Gary is coming soon. - This is your last chance.

1082
00:42:24,198 --> 00:42:27,658
(He hopes to succeed in stealing.)

1083
00:42:27,658 --> 00:42:29,228
(He's about to enter.)

1084
00:42:30,558 --> 00:42:33,828
(Gary climbs up from 2nd to 3rd.)

1085
00:42:36,228 --> 00:42:38,598
(The entrance is too narrow for the bike.)

1086
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:41,158
(Make some way for me.)

1087
00:42:42,328 --> 00:42:45,828
(Gary is about to reach the 4th floor.)

1088
00:42:45,828 --> 00:42:49,798
(Will Gary catch Seok Jin?)

1089
00:42:54,858 --> 00:42:56,128
Gosh, Seok Jin!

1090
00:42:56,968 --> 00:42:58,928
(Gary sees Seok Jin.)

1091
00:42:58,928 --> 00:43:01,758
(Why did I get caught now?)

1092
00:43:03,328 --> 00:43:05,398
(I'm here to register a bike.)

1093
00:43:06,228 --> 00:43:07,428
(Panting)

1094
00:43:07,828 --> 00:43:09,398
If this doesn't work, I'm doomed.

1095
00:43:11,158 --> 00:43:13,358
I don't think it'll work.

1096
00:43:13,728 --> 00:43:15,228
(The bike is a little shorter.)

1097
00:43:15,298 --> 00:43:17,998
I'm in trouble. Isn't it big enough?

1098
00:43:18,698 --> 00:43:20,998
(If Seok Jin weren't in the way...)

1099
00:43:21,528 --> 00:43:22,598
- Gosh. - You're in.

1100
00:43:22,598 --> 00:43:23,898
(What's Running Man Team's record?)

1101
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:25,128
Did we win?

1102
00:43:25,198 --> 00:43:26,968
- We lost. - What?

1103
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:29,058
- We lost? - Your record is 58.38 seconds.

1104
00:43:29,058 --> 00:43:31,028
- No way. - That's impossible.

1105
00:43:31,298 --> 00:43:32,898
I ran upstairs very fast.

1106
00:43:33,628 --> 00:43:35,328
There's just no way.

1107
00:43:36,058 --> 00:43:37,658
I ran up so fast.

1108
00:43:37,998 --> 00:43:39,558
Why did he take the bike downstairs?

1109
00:43:39,558 --> 00:43:40,898
He was in the way.

1110
00:43:40,898 --> 00:43:42,658
Where is Seok Jin?

1111
00:43:42,858 --> 00:43:45,498
- Are you okay, Ki Jin? - Okay.

1112
00:43:45,698 --> 00:43:47,228
- Okay. - Seok Jin.

1113
00:43:47,528 --> 00:43:49,598
Didn't you take the bike downstairs?

1114
00:43:49,598 --> 00:43:51,528
- What? - You're acting strange.

1115
00:43:52,798 --> 00:43:54,328
What were you doing with the bike downstairs?

1116
00:43:54,328 --> 00:43:57,228
- He blocked your way, didn't he? - Yes, he did.

1117
00:43:57,558 --> 00:43:59,598
- Gosh. - What's wrong with him?

1118
00:43:59,598 --> 00:44:01,558
Why did you bring the bike downstairs?

1119
00:44:01,558 --> 00:44:03,328
- You're strange. - What?

1120
00:44:03,458 --> 00:44:05,198
- What did you do? - He was standing with the bike.

1121
00:44:05,198 --> 00:44:07,128
- Was he? - Were you trying to block him?

1122
00:44:07,128 --> 00:44:09,328
- Is he a spy? - Wait, is he really a spy?

1123
00:44:09,398 --> 00:44:10,858
Seok Jin, are you hiding something?

1124
00:44:10,858 --> 00:44:12,658
Did you encounter him on your way up here?

1125
00:44:12,698 --> 00:44:14,798
He was standing at the corridor with the bike, just like this.

1126
00:44:15,398 --> 00:44:16,828
(The timing was really unfortunate.)

1127
00:44:17,728 --> 00:44:18,958
(He was not stealing memories,)

1128
00:44:18,958 --> 00:44:20,098
Gosh, Seok Jin.

1129
00:44:20,098 --> 00:44:22,998
(but he was definitely stealing the bike.)

1130
00:44:24,398 --> 00:44:27,558
I just said "Gosh, Seok Jin." and ran past him.

1131
00:44:27,558 --> 00:44:28,998
(I needed something big for the mission.)

1132
00:44:29,858 --> 00:44:31,098
- My goodness. - Okay, I got it.

1133
00:44:31,098 --> 00:44:32,498
You didn't really take it, did you?

1134
00:44:32,498 --> 00:44:33,928
No, I told you, I didn't.

1135
00:44:33,928 --> 00:44:34,928
(It was too small, so I put it back.)

1136
00:44:34,928 --> 00:44:36,028
- That was really suspicious. - What's wrong with him?

1137
00:44:36,028 --> 00:44:37,558
Did you steal my gold?

1138
00:44:37,558 --> 00:44:38,558
No way.

1139
00:44:38,898 --> 00:44:42,598
Why would I do that? I'd never steal your gold.

1140
00:44:42,828 --> 00:44:43,898
I have no idea why he did that.

1141
00:44:43,898 --> 00:44:46,198
- It's time for the penalty. - I don't get it, either.

1142
00:44:46,198 --> 00:44:47,258
Get ready, you bicycle thief.

1143
00:44:48,598 --> 00:44:50,898
- Come on. Sit. - What? It's Kwang Soo's turn.

1144
00:44:50,998 --> 00:44:52,698
- Yes. It's Kwang Soo's turn. - Get down, Seok Jin.

1145
00:44:54,328 --> 00:44:55,698
Why did you take the bicycle?

1146
00:44:55,698 --> 00:44:57,798
- Yes. Why did you do that? - Honestly,

1147
00:44:57,798 --> 00:44:59,098
- I wanted to take it home. - He's strange.

1148
00:44:59,098 --> 00:45:00,998
- Did you try to take it? - Did you load it into your car?

1149
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:02,498
- No, it's right over there. - Is it? Really?

1150
00:45:02,498 --> 00:45:04,458
- I've put it back there. - It isn't even Gary's bicycle.

1151
00:45:04,458 --> 00:45:05,458
It is his friend's bicycle.

1152
00:45:05,458 --> 00:45:07,398
I just asked people downstairs about its price.

1153
00:45:07,398 --> 00:45:08,858
You can't just take it.

1154
00:45:08,858 --> 00:45:10,698
I can.

1155
00:45:10,698 --> 00:45:12,098
- What? - What do you mean?

1156
00:45:12,298 --> 00:45:14,498
- You can't take it like that. - I want your glasses. Thank you.

1157
00:45:14,698 --> 00:45:16,898
- What's the matter with you? - No. I mean...

1158
00:45:16,898 --> 00:45:18,998
- My goodness. - What are you doing?

1159
00:45:18,998 --> 00:45:20,328
- Are you a spy? - Gosh. Here.

1160
00:45:20,328 --> 00:45:22,898
What are you doing with the glasses?

1161
00:45:22,998 --> 00:45:25,598
I'm really not a spy. Gosh.

1162
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:27,098
Why are you yelling at us?

1163
00:45:27,128 --> 00:45:28,458
I'm talking, not yelling.

1164
00:45:28,558 --> 00:45:31,928
What's wrong with me yelling anyway? Is there a problem?

1165
00:45:31,928 --> 00:45:33,398
No. I mean that you don't have any reason to yell at us.

1166
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:35,198
He's acting really strange.

1167
00:45:35,828 --> 00:45:37,798
- I shouldn't slap you softly. - Please slap softly.

1168
00:45:37,798 --> 00:45:38,798
All right. I get it.

1169
00:45:39,398 --> 00:45:41,158
(Slap)

1170
00:45:42,828 --> 00:45:44,298
He threw himself down on the floor.

1171
00:45:44,298 --> 00:45:45,598
I didn't slap him hard.

1172
00:45:45,598 --> 00:45:46,898
He's acting like a comedian.

1173
00:45:46,898 --> 00:45:48,098
(His reaction is clearly exaggerated.)

1174
00:45:49,658 --> 00:45:51,428
Do you want to become a comedian?

1175
00:45:52,028 --> 00:45:53,598
- What changed your mind? - He jumped backwards.

1176
00:45:53,998 --> 00:45:55,598
- Why did you jump like that? - Do you have a secret mission?

1177
00:45:55,598 --> 00:45:58,298
Did you see him jumping backwards just a moment after I slapped him?

1178
00:45:58,658 --> 00:45:59,758
- I did. - He actually jumped like that.

1179
00:45:59,758 --> 00:46:02,458
- He acted like a comedian. - He leaped like a frog.

1180
00:46:02,558 --> 00:46:04,758
(He reacted a moment after...)

1181
00:46:04,758 --> 00:46:07,098
(being slapped.)

1182
00:46:07,828 --> 00:46:09,398
I didn't slap him hard. You saw that, right?

1183
00:46:09,398 --> 00:46:10,658
He's like a comedian today.

1184
00:46:10,698 --> 00:46:12,058
(Seok Jin looks really suspicious.)

1185
00:46:12,658 --> 00:46:14,758
We had to win the race, but you ruined it.

1186
00:46:14,758 --> 00:46:16,498
- What's wrong with you? - Let's give it another try.

1187
00:46:16,498 --> 00:46:18,098
Please choose your next mission.

1188
00:46:18,698 --> 00:46:19,898
Let's pick 30,000km.

1189
00:46:19,898 --> 00:46:21,458
We must pass a mission, at least.

1190
00:46:21,458 --> 00:46:23,628
- Show the mission, please. - What's the mission?

1191
00:46:24,028 --> 00:46:25,158
- "Time Tables"? - It's about time tables.

1192
00:46:25,398 --> 00:46:27,698
The mission that everybody has to pass for 30,000km is...

1193
00:46:27,798 --> 00:46:29,198
"Wrong Time Tables".

1194
00:46:29,458 --> 00:46:30,828
- "Wrong Time Tables"? - "Wrong Time Tables"?

1195
00:46:30,828 --> 00:46:33,098
Each member has to answer time table questions.

1196
00:46:33,098 --> 00:46:35,158
When you answer the questions, you must give the number...

1197
00:46:35,458 --> 00:46:38,398
with correct 2nd digit but with the wrong 1st digit.

1198
00:46:38,398 --> 00:46:40,498
We must answer like, 2 times 9 is 19.

1199
00:46:40,498 --> 00:46:43,058
- Or 9 times 3 is 28. - How about 7 times 3 is 28?

1200
00:46:43,298 --> 00:46:44,758
- This is easier. - It's easier to get it wrong.

1201
00:46:44,758 --> 00:46:46,398
It's easier than the other way around.

1202
00:46:46,398 --> 00:46:47,758
(I'm sure we can pass this game.)

1203
00:46:48,358 --> 00:46:52,058
(I'll get it wrong to bid Gary farewell without any regret.)

1204
00:46:52,058 --> 00:46:53,658
- Are you going in this order? - Yes.

1205
00:46:54,098 --> 00:46:55,228
All right. Let's begin.

1206
00:46:55,798 --> 00:46:57,598
Wrong Time Tables

1207
00:46:57,598 --> 00:46:59,228
- Wrong Time Tables - Wrong Time Tables

1208
00:46:59,228 --> 00:47:00,328
What is 3 times 7?

1209
00:47:00,328 --> 00:47:01,328
22.

1210
00:47:01,328 --> 00:47:02,328
What is 6 times 4?

1211
00:47:02,328 --> 00:47:03,328
Thirty-throw.

1212
00:47:03,328 --> 00:47:04,798
(Is 6 times 4 thirty-throw?)

1213
00:47:05,058 --> 00:47:06,558
(What kind of number is that?)

1214
00:47:06,558 --> 00:47:08,298
What are you doing, Gary?

1215
00:47:08,498 --> 00:47:10,098
- What was that? - Do you have a special mission?

1216
00:47:10,098 --> 00:47:13,598
- You must be on a special mission. - What is "thirty-throw"?

1217
00:47:14,558 --> 00:47:16,058
What is "thirty-throw"?

1218
00:47:16,058 --> 00:47:17,658
- What language is that? - I lost my presence of mind.

1219
00:47:17,658 --> 00:47:19,498
I'm flustered because of the bicycle incident.

1220
00:47:19,498 --> 00:47:21,698
I just lifted it up because it was really pretty. Please forget it.

1221
00:47:21,698 --> 00:47:24,458
- Why did you try to steal the bike? - Why did you do that?

1222
00:47:24,958 --> 00:47:27,028
- You can't steal for that reason. - What is wrong with you?

1223
00:47:27,028 --> 00:47:28,958
- I can't stop thinking about it. - I did it because it was pretty.

1224
00:47:29,028 --> 00:47:30,328
Why did he bring it downstairs?

1225
00:47:30,328 --> 00:47:31,498
- Why did you do that, Seok Jin? - What was the reason?

1226
00:47:31,498 --> 00:47:32,858
- How could you do that? - Let's try one more time.

1227
00:47:32,858 --> 00:47:33,958
- Let's do it one more time. - This is your last chance.

1228
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:36,098
He made a mistake because of the bike incident.

1229
00:47:36,098 --> 00:47:37,698
- We need another chance. - I'll give you a second chance.

1230
00:47:37,698 --> 00:47:39,858
- All right. We can do it. - Yes. Let's go.

1231
00:47:40,128 --> 00:47:41,998
- Don't get it wrong this time. - Yes. Be careful.

1232
00:47:42,098 --> 00:47:43,828
- Wrong Time Tables - Wrong Time Tables

1233
00:47:43,828 --> 00:47:45,298
- Wrong Time Tables - Wrong Time Tables

1234
00:47:45,328 --> 00:47:46,398
What is 9 times 9?

1235
00:47:46,458 --> 00:47:47,458
84.

1236
00:47:47,458 --> 00:47:48,498
What is 6 times 4?

1237
00:47:50,228 --> 00:47:52,358
- 27. - He doesn't know the rule.

1238
00:47:52,598 --> 00:47:54,228
- You got the same question. - I need to get it wrong, right?

1239
00:47:54,398 --> 00:47:55,398
27.

1240
00:47:55,498 --> 00:47:56,498
That was way too slow.

1241
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:57,858
All right. I'll do it properly next time.

1242
00:47:57,858 --> 00:47:59,728
- What do you mean by next time? - He's so shameless.

1243
00:47:59,758 --> 00:48:00,958
- We don't have another chance. - Come on.

1244
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:02,858
- I thought that was acceptable. - Gary.

1245
00:48:02,858 --> 00:48:05,558
You're just as shameless as Seok Jin.

1246
00:48:06,228 --> 00:48:08,058
Both of you are really shameless.

1247
00:48:08,058 --> 00:48:10,098
Gary seriously needs to keep shooting Running Man.

1248
00:48:10,858 --> 00:48:12,498
- Gary, give it a second thought. - Come on, Gary.

1249
00:48:13,058 --> 00:48:14,158
You match us perfectly.

1250
00:48:14,158 --> 00:48:16,598
You shouldn't live like that.

1251
00:48:16,598 --> 00:48:17,998
I didn't have any trouble until now.

1252
00:48:18,858 --> 00:48:19,958
Gary, you belong here.

1253
00:48:19,958 --> 00:48:21,698
You can just use a calculator for multiplications.

1254
00:48:21,858 --> 00:48:23,128
- This is your final chance. - All right.

1255
00:48:23,128 --> 00:48:25,498
- Let's begin with Haha, again. - Okay. Stay focused, everyone.

1256
00:48:25,498 --> 00:48:27,098
- Wrong time tables - I feel...

1257
00:48:27,128 --> 00:48:28,498
- Okay. Let's begin. - I feel more pressured now.

1258
00:48:28,498 --> 00:48:32,228
(Seriously, let's deduct some distance.)

1259
00:48:32,228 --> 00:48:33,228
Let's start.

1260
00:48:33,658 --> 00:48:35,198
- Wrong time tables - Wrong time tables

1261
00:48:35,198 --> 00:48:36,698
- Wrong time tables - Wrong time tables

1262
00:48:36,758 --> 00:48:37,758
What is 7 times 5?

1263
00:48:37,758 --> 00:48:38,758
32.

1264
00:48:38,758 --> 00:48:40,228
- What is 2 times 4? - Jix.

1265
00:48:41,458 --> 00:48:42,458
(Jix?)

1266
00:48:42,758 --> 00:48:43,958
(He's stupid enough to be part of Running Man.)

1267
00:48:43,958 --> 00:48:45,498
- You tried to say "6". - Was it 6?

1268
00:48:45,498 --> 00:48:48,328
- He said "Jix", instead. - He wanted to say "six".

1269
00:48:48,328 --> 00:48:49,998
- What was that? - You wanted to say "six".

1270
00:48:49,998 --> 00:48:51,058
I said a wrong number.

1271
00:48:51,058 --> 00:48:52,898
- Anyway... - What's the matter?

1272
00:48:52,898 --> 00:48:53,898
What did I do wrong?

1273
00:48:53,898 --> 00:48:55,558
- That was cute. - It was a cute six.

1274
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:56,698
(He should've said a proper number.)

1275
00:48:56,698 --> 00:48:58,728
- That was really strange. - What on earth is "jix"?

1276
00:48:59,558 --> 00:49:01,858
- I said six. - You are strange.

1277
00:49:01,858 --> 00:49:04,798
- It was six. - Gary, just stay with us.

1278
00:49:04,928 --> 00:49:06,198
- "Jix". - My goodness.

1279
00:49:07,258 --> 00:49:08,998
I just spoke six a little differently.

1280
00:49:08,998 --> 00:49:10,498
What's wrong with his pronunciation?

1281
00:49:10,558 --> 00:49:12,698
- I said 6. - 2 times 4 is "jix".

1282
00:49:12,798 --> 00:49:14,458
We wouldn't be able to see him acting like this any more.

1283
00:49:14,458 --> 00:49:16,498
They might sound different, but they have the same meaning.

1284
00:49:16,498 --> 00:49:17,498
(It's the last time seeing Gary with them.)

1285
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:19,458
- How could we fail? - We missed a great opportunity.

1286
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:22,128
Should we try the ones which deduct 10,000km?

1287
00:49:22,128 --> 00:49:23,328
We shouldn't have failed "Wrong Time Tables".

1288
00:49:23,328 --> 00:49:25,498
What kind of present will Gary receive?

1289
00:49:25,498 --> 00:49:27,398
- Nothing. - We've got nothing so far.

1290
00:49:27,398 --> 00:49:29,098
Gary can win this Running Man Set.

1291
00:49:29,098 --> 00:49:30,398
What is that?

1292
00:49:31,358 --> 00:49:32,398
No.

1293
00:49:32,758 --> 00:49:34,398
Isn't it the set that we can buy at stationery stores?

1294
00:49:34,698 --> 00:49:37,198
It's the set containing the R flag, cue cards and R stickers.

1295
00:49:37,198 --> 00:49:40,698
Gary, if you get this set, set up the flag here...

1296
00:49:40,698 --> 00:49:41,798
so we can play Running Man games here.

1297
00:49:41,798 --> 00:49:43,228
Okay. We can use it that way.

1298
00:49:43,228 --> 00:49:44,598
- Good. - It's quite meaningful, then.

1299
00:49:44,598 --> 00:49:45,858
- It is meaningful. - Yes.

1300
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:48,198
All right. Please choose the next game.

1301
00:49:48,198 --> 00:49:49,398
Let's pick 30,000km.

1302
00:49:50,958 --> 00:49:52,098
- "Yut"? - Good.

1303
00:49:52,098 --> 00:49:53,728
This is good.

1304
00:49:54,098 --> 00:49:56,028
(Everyone's happy with Yut.)

1305
00:49:56,728 --> 00:49:58,028
I'm sure I can ace this.

1306
00:49:58,298 --> 00:49:59,658
Everyone has to throw one yut each.

1307
00:49:59,658 --> 00:50:02,198
You will succeed If all yut shows the same side,

1308
00:50:02,198 --> 00:50:03,898
(All yut has to face the same side.)

1309
00:50:04,658 --> 00:50:05,828
I'm sure I can ace this.

1310
00:50:06,528 --> 00:50:11,098
(After 7 years together, this kind of mission is a piece of cake.)

1311
00:50:12,128 --> 00:50:15,698
(It's a great chance to deduct 30,000km.)

1312
00:50:15,698 --> 00:50:16,828
I'm really good at playing yut.

1313
00:50:17,298 --> 00:50:19,398
- Okay. - Let's go. Haha's first.

1314
00:50:19,398 --> 00:50:20,858
- Just flip it once in the air. - Yes. Just like that.

1315
00:50:20,858 --> 00:50:22,658
All right. Let's begin with Haha.

1316
00:50:22,658 --> 00:50:25,028
Everyone's yut has to show the same side facing up. Let's begin.

1317
00:50:26,428 --> 00:50:28,558
(Haha's yut shows the front side up.)

1318
00:50:28,658 --> 00:50:29,798
It might be harder than I thought.

1319
00:50:30,298 --> 00:50:31,798
(The front side up? I get it.)

1320
00:50:33,798 --> 00:50:37,198
(I just need to toss this yut lightly in the air.)

1321
00:50:38,228 --> 00:50:40,758
(Gary's yut shows the front side up.)

1322
00:50:41,798 --> 00:50:43,628
Good. Gary tossed it perfectly.

1323
00:50:44,058 --> 00:50:48,098
(I don't want to let you go, but I'll do my best for you.)

1324
00:50:50,398 --> 00:50:51,958
- That looks good. - Okay.

1325
00:50:51,958 --> 00:50:52,958
(Ji Hyo's yut shows the front side up.)

1326
00:50:53,658 --> 00:50:56,298
(We only have four more to go!)

1327
00:50:57,498 --> 00:51:00,098
(Did he fail?)

1328
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:06,158
(Now, all Jong Kook needs is a bit of luck.)

1329
00:51:07,758 --> 00:51:08,798
(Jong Kook's yut shows the front side up.)

1330
00:51:08,798 --> 00:51:10,598
- That was really close. - Now, it's our turn.

1331
00:51:10,598 --> 00:51:12,128
- We only have three more to go. - All the unlucky ones are left.

1332
00:51:12,128 --> 00:51:14,098
(The Unlucky Trio will test their luck with their yut.)

1333
00:51:14,098 --> 00:51:15,158
Here comes the unlucky trio.

1334
00:51:15,398 --> 00:51:20,098
(Would unlucky Seok Jin be able to succeed this time?)

1335
00:51:21,628 --> 00:51:24,558
(Unbelievably, Seok Jin's yut shows the front side up.)

1336
00:51:26,598 --> 00:51:27,928
(The second member of the trio looks really anxious.)

1337
00:51:27,928 --> 00:51:29,098
- Here comes the super unlucky one. - You can do it, Kwang Soo.

1338
00:51:29,098 --> 00:51:30,658
- It's easy. - I thought I'd never have a chance.

1339
00:51:30,658 --> 00:51:31,958
- Come on, unlucky Kwang Soo. - Gosh.

1340
00:51:31,958 --> 00:51:34,528
- Come on. - We have the unluckiest two left.

1341
00:51:34,798 --> 00:51:36,828
- He's really nervous. - I thought I'd never have a chance.

1342
00:51:36,828 --> 00:51:38,558
Throw your yut at the same time.

1343
00:51:39,528 --> 00:51:41,098
Just toss it.

1344
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:43,058
(It's my chance to show how lucky I am to everyone.)

1345
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,298
- Okay. - Don't get too nervous.

1346
00:51:44,298 --> 00:51:45,698
Just toss it lightly in the air.

1347
00:51:46,028 --> 00:51:48,698
- Just toss it. - It's your turn now.

1348
00:51:48,698 --> 00:51:53,858
(I can do this. I can do this for Gary.)

1349
00:51:56,528 --> 00:51:59,658
(Gosh! Did he fail again?)

1350
00:52:02,298 --> 00:52:06,758
(Kwang Soo succeeds to get his yut show the front side up.)

1351
00:52:07,728 --> 00:52:08,828
(It's miraculous.)

1352
00:52:08,828 --> 00:52:10,858
- This is crazy. - Are you in your right mind?

1353
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,058
- Gosh. - Jae Seok. It's your turn.

1354
00:52:13,058 --> 00:52:14,858
- Although you're unlucky... - You're the last.

1355
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:16,298
Here comes the unluckiest.

1356
00:52:16,398 --> 00:52:17,658
He's definitely the unluckiest.

1357
00:52:17,658 --> 00:52:18,828
Can he do it?

1358
00:52:19,058 --> 00:52:20,958
- Just toss it. - Okay.

1359
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:22,358
- It's okay, Jae Seok. - It's our chance to deduct...

1360
00:52:22,398 --> 00:52:24,028
- 30,000km. We count on you. - Just toss it lightly in the air.

1361
00:52:24,028 --> 00:52:26,698
- Just toss it. - Toss it lightly.

1362
00:52:26,698 --> 00:52:28,958
(Jae Seok's yut will decide whether Gary will get the R flag or not.)

1363
00:52:29,298 --> 00:52:31,658
(Jae Seok tries to concentrate.)

1364
00:52:31,658 --> 00:52:33,998
- Gary should receive something. - Toss it lightly. Just toss it.

1365
00:52:33,998 --> 00:52:35,498
If you fail, then Gary will receive nothing.

1366
00:52:35,498 --> 00:52:37,098
(Will they be able to give a present to Gary before he leaves?)

1367
00:52:37,398 --> 00:52:38,958
Toss it lightly and you will succeed.

1368
00:52:38,958 --> 00:52:45,098
(Will Jae Seok be able to get his yut showing front side up?)

1369
00:52:47,558 --> 00:52:50,798
(They succeeds "Yut" with all their yut showing front side up.)

1370
00:52:55,098 --> 00:52:56,098
- Good job. - Nice.

1371
00:52:56,098 --> 00:52:58,098
- My goodness. - We succeeded.

1372
00:52:58,098 --> 00:53:00,198
- Finally, we got this. - Good job, everyone.

1373
00:53:00,198 --> 00:53:02,058
- Finally, we did it. - We are a united team, indeed.

1374
00:53:02,058 --> 00:53:03,498
(7012 means that 7 of them are united as one.)

1375
00:53:03,498 --> 00:53:04,998
We are good at getting the same results.

1376
00:53:04,998 --> 00:53:07,228
- Thank you, everyone. - We are always good at this.

1377
00:53:07,298 --> 00:53:09,028
- That was close. - 30,000km is deducted.

1378
00:53:09,698 --> 00:53:11,298
- We finally deducted some distance. - How much is left?

1379
00:53:11,298 --> 00:53:12,658
- It's unbelievable. - The Unlucky Trio made it.

1380
00:53:13,128 --> 00:53:14,698
We can finish it if we choose and succeed the 50,000 one.

1381
00:53:14,698 --> 00:53:15,858
- Okay. - Wait.

1382
00:53:16,128 --> 00:53:17,398
- We need to clear one more mission. - I can't believe we did it.

1383
00:53:17,398 --> 00:53:20,928
Let's choose 30,000km first, then play another 10,000km.

1384
00:53:20,928 --> 00:53:21,928
Please show us what the game is.

1385
00:53:22,398 --> 00:53:23,398
Let's go.

1386
00:53:24,598 --> 00:53:25,758
- "Name Tag"? - What's that?

1387
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:27,528
You need to find mini name tags.

1388
00:53:27,558 --> 00:53:28,558
Do we need to find them?

1389
00:53:28,658 --> 00:53:30,198
How small are they?

1390
00:53:30,198 --> 00:53:31,858
- Do you know the movie, "Ant-Man"? - Yes.

1391
00:53:32,258 --> 00:53:33,458
The name tags are as small as the Ant-Man from the movie.

1392
00:53:33,558 --> 00:53:34,758
Really?

1393
00:53:34,858 --> 00:53:36,398
How did you make such small name tags?

1394
00:53:36,398 --> 00:53:39,228
You have five minutes to find the name tags hidden in this studio.

1395
00:53:39,228 --> 00:53:40,958
- How about the living room? - You need to search there, too.

1396
00:53:40,958 --> 00:53:42,228
Can we help each other?

1397
00:53:42,228 --> 00:53:44,028
Do whatever you can. Just find them all in five minutes.

1398
00:53:44,028 --> 00:53:45,558
Five minutes? It's long enough to find them all.

1399
00:53:45,558 --> 00:53:47,898
Ready, set, start.

1400
00:53:47,898 --> 00:53:49,858
- You have five minutes from now. - Come on. We can do it.

1401
00:53:50,198 --> 00:53:51,358
It must be in this room.

1402
00:53:52,328 --> 00:53:56,498
(Let's do this for Gary.)

1403
00:53:56,498 --> 00:53:57,958
How am I supposed to find them?

1404
00:53:59,128 --> 00:54:00,258
How small are they?

1405
00:54:01,128 --> 00:54:02,498
I know there's one in this room.

1406
00:54:02,498 --> 00:54:04,658
(They can't find anything even with the help of the magnifying lens.)

1407
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:07,358
Does this mean we can't see it with our naked eyes?

1408
00:54:07,458 --> 00:54:09,258
I think we'll be able to spot them.

1409
00:54:10,258 --> 00:54:11,998
It's highly likely they hid one in here.

1410
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:14,228
(Gary is busy searching his room.)

1411
00:54:19,198 --> 00:54:20,398
Hold on.

1412
00:54:20,398 --> 00:54:23,458
(Seok Jin is looking for something bigger.)

1413
00:54:25,698 --> 00:54:28,858
(Is he going to steal the carpet?)

1414
00:54:28,858 --> 00:54:30,828
Ji Hyo is driving me crazy.

1415
00:54:31,298 --> 00:54:33,198
(Seok Jin only goes for big objects.)

1416
00:54:33,198 --> 00:54:34,698
Why did Ji Hyo have to steal that?

1417
00:54:34,698 --> 00:54:35,858
Is there one in the bathroom?

1418
00:54:36,358 --> 00:54:37,428
(Seok Jin steps on the carpet.)

1419
00:54:38,298 --> 00:54:41,128
(Are you moving?)

1420
00:54:42,828 --> 00:54:44,098
- Did you find it? - No.

1421
00:54:44,098 --> 00:54:45,928
(Seok Jin has obtained the carpet.)

1422
00:54:46,128 --> 00:54:47,398
This is so hard.

1423
00:54:50,498 --> 00:54:52,498
- Did you find it? - It's Jong Kook.

1424
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:53,728
- Where is it? - Look.

1425
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:56,858
- Jong Kook. - What?

1426
00:54:56,858 --> 00:54:58,598
- I found yours. - You found it?

1427
00:54:59,558 --> 00:55:03,658
(Seok Jin is about to get caught.)

1428
00:55:03,658 --> 00:55:04,828
(I'll take the carpet over the bicycle.)

1429
00:55:04,828 --> 00:55:07,198
- How small is it? - You can spot them with your eyes.

1430
00:55:07,198 --> 00:55:08,428
How did you find that?

1431
00:55:08,698 --> 00:55:10,198
- Jong Kook. - What?

1432
00:55:10,198 --> 00:55:12,558
- I found yours. - How small is it?

1433
00:55:12,998 --> 00:55:16,158
(Gary comes into the living room.)

1434
00:55:16,558 --> 00:55:22,928
(Seok Jin can't afford to get caught stealing again.)

1435
00:55:23,198 --> 00:55:24,358
It's Jong Kook's.

1436
00:55:24,828 --> 00:55:27,698
(Seok Jin is about to step outside.)

1437
00:55:27,698 --> 00:55:30,458
(Gary appears right on time.)

1438
00:55:30,458 --> 00:55:33,658
(He's closing in on Seok Jin.)

1439
00:55:33,658 --> 00:55:38,398
(What will happen to Seok Jin?)

1440
00:55:38,728 --> 00:55:39,798
Really?

1441
00:55:42,198 --> 00:55:43,728
This was the only one.

1442
00:55:43,728 --> 00:55:44,898
(He managed to escape.)

1443
00:55:47,598 --> 00:55:48,758
This was the only one.

1444
00:55:48,958 --> 00:55:50,998
Can you hold the door for me?

1445
00:55:51,258 --> 00:55:52,528
This is so heavy.

1446
00:55:54,658 --> 00:55:55,828
This will work.

1447
00:55:56,128 --> 00:55:57,258
I'm sure of it.

1448
00:55:57,658 --> 00:55:58,858
This can't not work.

1449
00:55:58,858 --> 00:56:01,028
(The bicycle thief grew as a big time thief.)

1450
00:56:01,028 --> 00:56:02,328
How did they all do this?

1451
00:56:02,728 --> 00:56:05,998
- The diameter is 236cm. - That's it?

1452
00:56:06,228 --> 00:56:07,298
It's good, right?

1453
00:56:07,828 --> 00:56:08,898
You've succeeded.

1454
00:56:08,898 --> 00:56:11,028
(Seok Jin succeeded the secret mission.)

1455
00:56:11,028 --> 00:56:12,428
I didn't think the bicycle would be too small.

1456
00:56:12,558 --> 00:56:15,328
I have to pay him back now for the bicycle.

1457
00:56:15,858 --> 00:56:17,058
(All the members have succeeded.)

1458
00:56:17,558 --> 00:56:20,098
(They succeeded the mission with 8 seconds remaining.)

1459
00:56:20,158 --> 00:56:21,658
You've succeeded.

1460
00:56:21,828 --> 00:56:23,258
Where'd the carpet go?

1461
00:56:24,928 --> 00:56:27,058
- Where did it go? - There used to be a carpet here.

1462
00:56:27,158 --> 00:56:28,358
Where did it go?

1463
00:56:28,528 --> 00:56:31,298
The staff moved it because it was getting dusty.

1464
00:56:31,758 --> 00:56:33,028
The room looks so vacant now.

1465
00:56:33,798 --> 00:56:35,698
Didn't the room look better with the carpet?

1466
00:56:35,698 --> 00:56:37,858
The staff moved it somewhere.

1467
00:56:37,958 --> 00:56:39,758
It's not in the back of your car, is it?

1468
00:56:39,928 --> 00:56:43,028
What are you talking about? That's nonsense.

1469
00:56:43,058 --> 00:56:45,558
It got even dustier in here.

1470
00:56:45,558 --> 00:56:47,558
They said it's not good for the respiratory system.

1471
00:56:47,758 --> 00:56:50,958
(First the bicycle and now the carpet? This is strange.)

1472
00:56:51,128 --> 00:56:53,898
You have accumulated 60,000km.

1473
00:56:53,898 --> 00:56:55,228
(They accumulated that much after 7 failed attempts.)

1474
00:56:55,228 --> 00:56:57,098
- Let's do 30,000 now. - Let's do it.

1475
00:56:57,098 --> 00:56:59,358
Should we do 30,000 for "Staff Members"?

1476
00:56:59,758 --> 00:57:01,698
- That's the only one left. - Let's do it, then.

1477
00:57:01,698 --> 00:57:02,958
30,000 for "Staff Members".

1478
00:57:03,898 --> 00:57:07,328
(I have a bad feeling about this.)

1479
00:57:07,898 --> 00:57:08,998
Please turn it over.

1480
00:57:08,998 --> 00:57:12,098
(What's the mission for 30,000km?)

1481
00:57:12,298 --> 00:57:13,728
("Camera Staff")

1482
00:57:13,728 --> 00:57:15,498
- "Camera Staff". - What's that?

1483
00:57:16,398 --> 00:57:18,358
For this mission,

1484
00:57:18,728 --> 00:57:21,758
you will have to arm wrestle the camera staff.

1485
00:57:22,858 --> 00:57:24,328
(This is bad news.)

1486
00:57:24,328 --> 00:57:25,358
Just one of us?

1487
00:57:25,628 --> 00:57:29,658
Three people from each side will have a battle of arm wrestle.

1488
00:57:29,658 --> 00:57:32,698
- The first team to win twice wins. - Two wins?

1489
00:57:33,058 --> 00:57:35,128
- I'm not good at arm wrestling. - Me neither.

1490
00:57:35,128 --> 00:57:37,628
(Jong Kook is getting warmed up.)

1491
00:57:37,628 --> 00:57:41,658
We will bring out three members from the camera staff.

1492
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:44,498
- This is going to be hard. - They're so strong.

1493
00:57:44,498 --> 00:57:45,898
- They'll break our arms. - They're really strong.

1494
00:57:46,658 --> 00:57:48,798
(Here they come.)

1495
00:57:49,128 --> 00:57:51,228
We should be fine as long as the zimizib staff doesn't come.

1496
00:57:52,158 --> 00:57:54,898
(Everything will be okay as long as it's not the zimizib staff.)

1497
00:57:55,498 --> 00:57:57,298
I think it's him.

1498
00:57:57,298 --> 00:57:59,058
(Gary has a bad feeling.)

1499
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:00,628
I think it's him.

1500
00:58:00,758 --> 00:58:02,728
(You can tell he's strong in a glance.)

1501
00:58:02,728 --> 00:58:05,528
(This man has a history.)

1502
00:58:05,528 --> 00:58:10,758
(He almost covered the Running Man Field Day with blood.)

1503
00:58:10,758 --> 00:58:13,028
(You'll be hospitalised with a slight nudge by him.)

1504
00:58:13,028 --> 00:58:16,958
(It's Mr Zimizib, Yoon Hong Min.)

1505
00:58:16,958 --> 00:58:19,128
- Are you kidding me? - He shouldn't be here.

1506
00:58:19,128 --> 00:58:20,558
(Jong Kook looks slightly nervous.)

1507
00:58:20,558 --> 00:58:22,128
This is too much.

1508
00:58:22,128 --> 00:58:23,158
(This can't be done.)

1509
00:58:23,158 --> 00:58:26,458
I'll introduce the lineup of the team.

1510
00:58:26,458 --> 00:58:27,958
There's Yoon Hong Min.

1511
00:58:27,958 --> 00:58:29,658
He's so strong.

1512
00:58:29,658 --> 00:58:33,328
- The youngest one is Suh Dong Hwi. - He looks strong.

1513
00:58:33,598 --> 00:58:36,328
Their last member and leader is Kang Chan Hee.

1514
00:58:36,328 --> 00:58:38,758
(Kang Chan Hee, Team Leader)

1515
00:58:38,758 --> 00:58:40,998
I'll go against him.

1516
00:58:41,198 --> 00:58:42,998
We'll take a win from him.

1517
00:58:43,028 --> 00:58:44,398
Chan Hee isn't all that.

1518
00:58:44,398 --> 00:58:46,258
(Mr Kang prefers technique over strength.)

1519
00:58:46,298 --> 00:58:48,028
Please decide on who'll go first.

1520
00:58:48,028 --> 00:58:49,598
(The order will greatly affect the result.)

1521
00:58:49,898 --> 00:58:52,598
(On the other hand, the camera staff look at ease.)

1522
00:58:53,058 --> 00:58:54,828
(Both teams decided on the order of the lineup.)

1523
00:58:54,828 --> 00:58:57,628
These are the two people for the first match.

1524
00:58:57,628 --> 00:58:59,928
The first player from Running Man is...

1525
00:58:59,928 --> 00:59:03,498
(The first player from Running Man is?)

1526
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:04,598
- Gary. - Yes!

1527
00:59:04,858 --> 00:59:06,528
The first player from the camera staff is...

1528
00:59:07,558 --> 00:59:09,458
- Kang Chan Hee. - I knew it.

1529
00:59:09,458 --> 00:59:11,298
(Kang Chan Hee goes first.)

1530
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:14,198
- We have to win this one. - You have to win.

1531
00:59:14,198 --> 00:59:15,758
- I can't afford to win. - You have to win.

1532
00:59:15,898 --> 00:59:19,158
- Don't let your guard down. - He could be strong.

1533
00:59:19,158 --> 00:59:21,598
- Don't underestimate him. - I haven't worked out for so long.

1534
00:59:21,598 --> 00:59:23,458
Look at his arms.

1535
00:59:23,458 --> 00:59:26,928
(He has strong muscles from holding heavy cameras.)

1536
00:59:26,928 --> 00:59:28,828
Look at how broad his shoulders are.

1537
00:59:29,528 --> 00:59:30,558
Chan Hee is pretty strong, too.

1538
00:59:30,558 --> 00:59:31,658
His grip is so strong.

1539
00:59:32,128 --> 00:59:35,528
He's been working with heavy cameras all this time.

1540
00:59:37,058 --> 00:59:39,458
He's so strong. I don't think I'll win.

1541
00:59:39,658 --> 00:59:40,728
Get ready.

1542
00:59:40,728 --> 00:59:44,898
(It's the battle between the leaders of each team.)

1543
00:59:45,558 --> 00:59:48,028
(This won't be easy for both sides.)

1544
00:59:48,028 --> 00:59:49,598
Set. Go.

1545
00:59:51,028 --> 00:59:52,128
He won.

1546
00:59:52,698 --> 00:59:54,198
(He's surprised.)

1547
00:59:55,128 --> 00:59:57,398
(That was the end of him.)

1548
00:59:57,398 --> 00:59:58,898
- Did you let me win? - No.

1549
00:59:58,898 --> 01:00:00,328
(He does prefer technique over strength.)

1550
01:00:00,328 --> 01:00:01,998
- What was that? - That was easy.

1551
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:04,228
Team Running Man is leading by one point.

1552
01:00:04,228 --> 01:00:05,658
We just need one more victory now.

1553
01:00:05,658 --> 01:00:07,258
Who's up next?

1554
01:00:07,258 --> 01:00:09,928
The second player from Running Man is Kwang Soo.

1555
01:00:09,928 --> 01:00:11,728
- Okay. - You can win it for us.

1556
01:00:11,728 --> 01:00:14,458
The second player from the camera staff is Yoon Hong Min.

1557
01:00:14,458 --> 01:00:16,128
(It's Yoon Hong Min.)

1558
01:00:16,128 --> 01:00:17,358
(I'm going against the zimizib?)

1559
01:00:17,358 --> 01:00:19,258
What a twist of fate.

1560
01:00:19,258 --> 01:00:20,658
Kwang Soo isn't that weak.

1561
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:22,658
(Mr Zimizib enters the stage.)

1562
01:00:22,658 --> 01:00:26,558
(The 2nd round is Kwang Soo against Hong Min.)

1563
01:00:28,428 --> 01:00:30,658
(He's very serious.)

1564
01:00:30,658 --> 01:00:33,598
(He's determined.)

1565
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:35,858
It feels totally different this time.

1566
01:00:36,028 --> 01:00:37,698
This is an important match.

1567
01:00:37,698 --> 01:00:38,928
Ready.

1568
01:00:39,328 --> 01:00:41,358
(The fate of "Balance the Distance" lies in Kwang Soo's hands.)

1569
01:00:41,358 --> 01:00:42,828
Set, go!

1570
01:00:42,828 --> 01:00:45,158
(The 2nd round begins.)

1571
01:00:46,858 --> 01:00:48,458
(It's a close one.)

1572
01:00:48,458 --> 01:00:49,858
Kwang Soo is fighting back.

1573
01:00:49,858 --> 01:00:51,428
He's winning.

1574
01:00:51,428 --> 01:00:53,858
(Kwang Soo unleashes his power against Mr Zimizib.)

1575
01:00:54,558 --> 01:00:56,528
He's winning.

1576
01:00:57,228 --> 01:01:01,158
(We only thought of Kwang Soo as...)

1577
01:01:01,458 --> 01:01:06,928
(a tall and weak giraffe.)

1578
01:01:08,128 --> 01:01:12,458
(He's always been a troublemaker.)

1579
01:01:12,458 --> 01:01:16,028
I can't do this. This is the end of me.

1580
01:01:16,858 --> 01:01:21,328
(He's determined...)

1581
01:01:22,158 --> 01:01:26,428
(to give something to Gary.)

1582
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:30,098
(He's trying his hardest.)

1583
01:01:31,298 --> 01:01:33,898
(Is he going to make the miracle happen?)

1584
01:01:33,898 --> 01:01:35,498
Kwang Soo is determined.

1585
01:01:35,558 --> 01:01:37,198
Is this really happening?

1586
01:01:39,528 --> 01:01:42,998
(Kwang Soo wins!)

1587
01:01:42,998 --> 01:01:46,458
(He did it!)

1588
01:01:46,728 --> 01:01:52,298
(Kwang Soo desperately wanted to win this one for Gary.)

1589
01:01:52,958 --> 01:01:54,028
(He's in pain.)

1590
01:01:54,028 --> 01:01:55,598
- He's a beast. - He's stronger than he looks.

1591
01:01:55,798 --> 01:01:56,858
That was amazing.

1592
01:01:57,298 --> 01:01:59,998
(Kwang Soo's surprising performance puts an end to Gary's last mission.)

1593
01:01:59,998 --> 01:02:01,728
The score is 2 to 0.

1594
01:02:02,028 --> 01:02:04,258
The game is over. You have succeeded.

1595
01:02:04,258 --> 01:02:05,258
(They successfully accumulate a total of 77,000km.)

1596
01:02:05,258 --> 01:02:07,498
Do I win the flag?

1597
01:02:07,528 --> 01:02:09,198
You will be awarded with the Running Man package.

1598
01:02:09,198 --> 01:02:10,598
(Gary wins the Running Man package as a reward.)

1599
01:02:10,598 --> 01:02:14,928
We should've done better for him.

1600
01:02:15,198 --> 01:02:16,728
At least, he won something.

1601
01:02:16,728 --> 01:02:19,758
I'll put out the flag even when it rains or snows.

1602
01:02:19,798 --> 01:02:21,398
What's all this junk?

1603
01:02:22,458 --> 01:02:24,898
You have no idea how much the kids love these things.

1604
01:02:24,898 --> 01:02:26,358
(They will be sold at high prices among elementary school kids.)

1605
01:02:26,358 --> 01:02:28,398
I like the flags.

1606
01:02:28,398 --> 01:02:31,158
There's another gift from the staff members.

1607
01:02:31,358 --> 01:02:33,858
- Really? - Is Gary really leaving?

1608
01:02:34,158 --> 01:02:35,498
(These are the gifts.)

1609
01:02:35,498 --> 01:02:37,728
- What's this? - Is it a puzzle?

1610
01:02:37,858 --> 01:02:40,328
They made your face with all the pictures of the past.

1611
01:02:41,228 --> 01:02:46,358
They're pictures of the members from episode 1 to 317.

1612
01:02:46,358 --> 01:02:48,658
- This is amazing. - You made my face with those?

1613
01:02:48,658 --> 01:02:52,128
Yes. Look at this picture whenever you miss us.

1614
01:02:53,098 --> 01:02:54,328
It's made of gold.

1615
01:02:54,928 --> 01:02:56,028
What?

1616
01:02:56,458 --> 01:02:57,598
Are you serious?

1617
01:02:57,658 --> 01:02:59,858
- What is that? - It's made of gold.

1618
01:03:00,398 --> 01:03:02,198
Thank you...

1619
01:03:02,198 --> 01:03:04,498
- for all the memories. - It's severance pay.

1620
01:03:04,958 --> 01:03:06,398
That's your severance pay.

1621
01:03:06,558 --> 01:03:09,798
Gary has been with us every Sunday.

1622
01:03:10,228 --> 01:03:11,898
It's time to say goodbye now.

1623
01:03:13,098 --> 01:03:14,428
This is his last day with us.

1624
01:03:14,428 --> 01:03:16,428
Let's give a big round of applause...

1625
01:03:16,428 --> 01:03:19,258
for all his hard work.

1626
01:03:19,498 --> 01:03:21,028
- Thank you. - Good job, Gary.

1627
01:03:21,028 --> 01:03:22,258
(Well done.)

1628
01:03:22,898 --> 01:03:23,928
Looks like...

1629
01:03:23,928 --> 01:03:27,058
Ji Hyo will have to find a new boyfriend.

1630
01:03:27,058 --> 01:03:29,728
I thought she'd cry. I'm a bit disappointed.

1631
01:03:29,728 --> 01:03:32,828
Ji Hyo should say something.

1632
01:03:32,828 --> 01:03:39,128
(Ji Hyo spent the most time with him as Monday Couple.)

1633
01:03:44,698 --> 01:03:47,258
I already talked to him in private.

1634
01:03:47,428 --> 01:03:48,628
I see.

1635
01:03:49,058 --> 01:03:51,128
I'm sad.

1636
01:03:51,658 --> 01:03:53,428
I'm sad to see you leave,

1637
01:03:54,058 --> 01:03:56,498
but I support you in all of your endeavours. Good luck.

1638
01:03:56,828 --> 01:04:00,228
I'll repeat what Ji Hyo said about Gary...

1639
01:04:00,258 --> 01:04:04,228
when Gary wasn't present at the time.

1640
01:04:04,758 --> 01:04:08,798
"Mondays without him will feel so empty from now on."

1641
01:04:09,158 --> 01:04:11,898
- She said that while crying. - When did I say that?

1642
01:04:11,898 --> 01:04:14,558
- I didn't say that. - I heard her say something else.

1643
01:04:15,098 --> 01:04:16,758
"Is Gary out of his mind?"

1644
01:04:18,958 --> 01:04:20,758
That's what I heard.

1645
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:25,828
Gary talked about his dreams as a musician.

1646
01:04:25,828 --> 01:04:28,428
We hope your dreams will come true.

1647
01:04:28,428 --> 01:04:30,158
Thank you, Gary.

1648
01:04:30,398 --> 01:04:31,528
Thank you.

1649
01:04:31,528 --> 01:04:33,898
We'll have dinner with everyone.

1650
01:04:33,898 --> 01:04:34,998
Is that so? Shall we go?

1651
01:04:34,998 --> 01:04:37,258
Gary, please close the clapperboard to end the show.

1652
01:04:37,398 --> 01:04:38,898
It's your last time.

1653
01:04:39,428 --> 01:04:41,028
In 1, 2, 3.

1654
01:04:41,328 --> 01:04:43,698
- Thank you, everyone. - Let's take a photo.

1655
01:04:44,158 --> 01:04:45,728
(It's time for a farewell party.)

1656
01:04:45,728 --> 01:04:47,698
Do we go inside?

1657
01:04:47,798 --> 01:04:49,628
Did you prepare this for me?

1658
01:04:50,958 --> 01:04:53,258
(We want Gary, our boyfriend on Mondays, to stay.)

1659
01:04:53,258 --> 01:04:56,628
Thank you so much for the last seven years, and enjoy the food.

1660
01:04:56,628 --> 01:04:58,728
Thank you for everything. Thank you.

1661
01:04:59,358 --> 01:05:00,458
Thank you.

1662
01:05:00,458 --> 01:05:03,158
(We thank Gary for 77,000km of his passion.)

1663
01:05:03,158 --> 01:05:04,398
Enjoy your food.

1664
01:05:04,398 --> 01:05:06,428
(We thank Gary for 77,000km of his passion.)

1665
01:05:06,698 --> 01:05:11,928
(Running Man will stay with you wherever you go.)

1666
01:05:12,298 --> 01:05:13,828
- See you. - Thank you.

1667
01:05:14,228 --> 01:05:15,628
Goodbye.

1668
01:05:15,628 --> 01:05:17,098
(He says farewell to the members.)

1669
01:05:17,098 --> 01:05:18,258
See you, Gary.

1670
01:05:18,258 --> 01:05:20,358
- I'll see you next week. - Sure.

1671
01:05:20,358 --> 01:05:22,198
- See you. - Thank you.

1672
01:05:22,198 --> 01:05:24,598
- Goodbye. - Bye.

1673
01:05:24,598 --> 01:05:28,198
(He says farewell to everyone.)

1674
01:05:31,628 --> 01:05:32,628
(He looks around.)

1675
01:05:32,628 --> 01:05:34,198
Why do you keep following me?

1676
01:05:34,498 --> 01:05:36,898
I have to pull myself together back in the studio.

1677
01:05:37,358 --> 01:05:39,598
Could we record a short video message of you?

1678
01:05:39,598 --> 01:05:40,758
A video message?

1679
01:05:41,428 --> 01:05:43,628
We left the camera in your studio.

1680
01:05:43,628 --> 01:05:44,828
You haven't taken it yet?

1681
01:05:45,058 --> 01:05:47,328
- I'd like to take it now. - Okay.

1682
01:05:48,028 --> 01:05:49,228
It's completely empty.

1683
01:05:50,958 --> 01:05:55,258
(Gary's back looks sad and lonely.)

1684
01:05:55,358 --> 01:05:57,558
(It feels empty.)

1685
01:06:00,028 --> 01:06:01,258
What's this?

1686
01:06:03,658 --> 01:06:06,058
(There's a big present in the middle of his studio.)

1687
01:06:06,898 --> 01:06:09,458
(What's this?)

1688
01:06:09,458 --> 01:06:10,898
(He takes the card.)

1689
01:06:11,698 --> 01:06:13,558
"Six members excluding you..."

1690
01:06:14,428 --> 01:06:16,398
"were given..."

1691
01:06:17,328 --> 01:06:19,328
"a secret mission today."

1692
01:06:19,728 --> 01:06:24,328
"It was to steal an item that commemorated the time with you."

1693
01:06:24,328 --> 01:06:28,128
"They've returned the stolen items and only took the memories..."

1694
01:06:28,728 --> 01:06:30,058
"they've had with you."

1695
01:06:30,758 --> 01:06:34,628
(The members gave presents to commemorate their times together.)

1696
01:06:34,628 --> 01:06:37,058
"Here's your last mission."

1697
01:06:37,698 --> 01:06:42,198
"Put the items back to where they were."

1698
01:06:44,858 --> 01:06:48,658
They stole items that were difficult to carry...

1699
01:06:49,198 --> 01:06:50,728
to remember them by.

1700
01:06:51,298 --> 01:06:52,528
Gosh, what's this?

1701
01:06:52,528 --> 01:06:54,458
(Is it a present?)

1702
01:06:54,458 --> 01:06:57,398
They left me presents where the stolen item...

1703
01:06:57,958 --> 01:06:59,628
used to be.

1704
01:07:00,028 --> 01:07:04,458
(Kwang Soo gave him speakers Gary always wanted to have.)

1705
01:07:04,458 --> 01:07:06,258
(He also wrote him a letter.)

1706
01:07:06,258 --> 01:07:07,958
It's a handwritten letter.

1707
01:07:07,958 --> 01:07:12,158
"Dear Gary, I still can't believe that you're leaving."

1708
01:07:12,158 --> 01:07:16,328
"I regret that I haven't expressed enough of my love, gratitude..."

1709
01:07:16,358 --> 01:07:18,928
"and apologies to you."

1710
01:07:20,358 --> 01:07:21,658
I'll read it later.

1711
01:07:21,858 --> 01:07:23,298
If I read it now,

1712
01:07:24,358 --> 01:07:25,928
I might get tearful.

1713
01:07:28,528 --> 01:07:31,028
I won't get to see you every Monday from now on,

1714
01:07:31,528 --> 01:07:33,328
but we're already a family.

1715
01:07:33,558 --> 01:07:35,898
I'll call you more, and I hope that...

1716
01:07:36,028 --> 01:07:37,698
we see each other more often.

1717
01:07:39,698 --> 01:07:42,158
Kwang Soo, I love you.

1718
01:07:42,898 --> 01:07:45,728
(He's grateful to Gary for being there for him.)

1719
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:47,328
Dear Gary,

1720
01:07:47,758 --> 01:07:50,398
thank you so much. I love you forever.

1721
01:07:50,758 --> 01:07:52,258
It's from Jong Kook.

1722
01:07:52,298 --> 01:07:55,098
(Gary and Jong Kook are close.)

1723
01:07:55,098 --> 01:07:56,658
"Gary, you know how I feel."

1724
01:07:56,998 --> 01:07:59,658
"It's so difficult to write a letter like this to you."

1725
01:08:00,758 --> 01:08:03,898
You worked hard for a long time. Stay healthy.

1726
01:08:03,928 --> 01:08:05,398
Good luck in everything you do.

1727
01:08:05,658 --> 01:08:08,428
We'll still see each other, so let's not be sad.

1728
01:08:08,558 --> 01:08:11,528
I bought you some cosmetics so please become handsome.

1729
01:08:11,898 --> 01:08:13,798
I hope you will transform.

1730
01:08:15,198 --> 01:08:16,628
Gosh, Seok Jin.

1731
01:08:17,798 --> 01:08:21,358
(Why did he steal this?)

1732
01:08:21,658 --> 01:08:23,268
(Seok Jin's present is red ginseng.)

1733
01:08:23,268 --> 01:08:24,358
Goodness.

1734
01:08:24,358 --> 01:08:25,498
(Seok Jin's present is red ginseng.)

1735
01:08:25,498 --> 01:08:29,558
Isn't this a gift he received on Chuseok?

1736
01:08:29,558 --> 01:08:30,698
(It looks like a Chuseok present.)

1737
01:08:30,728 --> 01:08:33,298
Gary, I still can't believe it.

1738
01:08:33,528 --> 01:08:37,328
During the last seven years, we talked about many things.

1739
01:08:37,558 --> 01:08:41,428
We shared a room together during mud games...

1740
01:08:41,498 --> 01:08:43,128
and waited for our turns to shower.

1741
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:46,398
On one hand, I was angry when I heard that you're quitting.

1742
01:08:46,698 --> 01:08:50,898
But I also understood you, so I was confused about what I felt.

1743
01:08:51,528 --> 01:08:53,828
I'll have to respect your wish.

1744
01:08:54,128 --> 01:08:55,598
I love you, Gary.

1745
01:08:57,658 --> 01:08:58,858
I still remember this...

1746
01:08:59,858 --> 01:09:04,098
about Haha. We were in a car together.

1747
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:07,158
I told him that I was invited to join Running Man.

1748
01:09:07,398 --> 01:09:10,198
Then I asked him if he's also joining, and he said yes.

1749
01:09:10,768 --> 01:09:13,998
I told him that I was worried as I've never been on a variety show.

1750
01:09:14,398 --> 01:09:15,558
I didn't know what I should do.

1751
01:09:15,698 --> 01:09:18,828
I wanted to remain a musician at the time,

1752
01:09:18,828 --> 01:09:20,558
but this is what he told me.

1753
01:09:20,558 --> 01:09:21,558
(Haha said...)

1754
01:09:21,558 --> 01:09:23,628
He said that if I'm also good at doing variety shows,

1755
01:09:24,698 --> 01:09:29,498
I shouldn't shy away from it.

1756
01:09:29,598 --> 01:09:31,768
I still remember him saying that.

1757
01:09:31,768 --> 01:09:35,028
We were in the back seat of a car at a gas station.

1758
01:09:35,028 --> 01:09:36,558
(Haha's words brought Gary to Running Man.)

1759
01:09:36,558 --> 01:09:38,328
It's very light.

1760
01:09:40,028 --> 01:09:41,498
Gosh!

1761
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:44,898
(Haha got him three dried squids.)

1762
01:09:44,898 --> 01:09:47,298
Gary, I can't believe it.

1763
01:09:47,298 --> 01:09:49,498
When the ratings weren't that high in the beginning of Running Man,

1764
01:09:49,498 --> 01:09:52,598
we spent the night at Han River. We prayed for things...

1765
01:09:52,598 --> 01:09:56,098
to turn out well at my house. We rolled on the floor laughing.

1766
01:09:56,228 --> 01:09:59,098
I miss the times when we dreamed while drinking soju.

1767
01:09:59,098 --> 01:10:01,558
I hope you'll be healthy...

1768
01:10:01,698 --> 01:10:04,598
and have a wonderful family after you get married.

1769
01:10:04,828 --> 01:10:06,298
Let's get old together.

1770
01:10:06,858 --> 01:10:09,358
- I love you. - You're my role model.

1771
01:10:09,358 --> 01:10:10,798
I love you.

1772
01:10:11,198 --> 01:10:14,058
I love you. From Haha who's more handsome than you.

1773
01:10:14,828 --> 01:10:19,698
(He remembers each of his precious memories.)

1774
01:10:19,698 --> 01:10:21,598
(He finds a present from Jae Seok.)

1775
01:10:21,598 --> 01:10:23,858
Goodness, what's this?

1776
01:10:23,998 --> 01:10:26,698
(Jae Seok gave him sneakers for his new journey.)

1777
01:10:26,698 --> 01:10:30,428
"Gary, it's been seven years since we've been on Running Man together."

1778
01:10:30,828 --> 01:10:34,768
Gary, I'll think of you during next week's recording.

1779
01:10:35,158 --> 01:10:38,858
As I know what you want to achieve in the future,

1780
01:10:38,858 --> 01:10:43,958
the other members and I support you in all of your endeavours.

1781
01:10:43,958 --> 01:10:47,028
Call me any time you want to be back on a variety show.

1782
01:10:47,028 --> 01:10:49,098
Okay, Gary? See you.

1783
01:10:49,358 --> 01:10:51,768
It's too embarrassing for me to continue, so I stop here.

1784
01:10:51,768 --> 01:10:54,358
See you again. I'll call you. You did a good job.

1785
01:10:56,058 --> 01:11:00,198
(The only item that remains is the plant.)

1786
01:11:01,858 --> 01:11:03,398
Gosh, Ji Hyo.

1787
01:11:04,458 --> 01:11:06,828
(His heart feels as heavy as the plant.)

1788
01:11:06,828 --> 01:11:08,498
My dear Ji Hyo.

1789
01:11:08,498 --> 01:11:09,958
(His heart feels as heavy as the plant.)

1790
01:11:11,398 --> 01:11:13,498
There are two presents from her.

1791
01:11:13,558 --> 01:11:15,768
She gave me an electronic massager.

1792
01:11:15,768 --> 01:11:19,858
I often get muscle pains because I have spinal disc herniation.

1793
01:11:20,458 --> 01:11:23,268
She used to massage my shoulders at times...

1794
01:11:23,268 --> 01:11:25,528
during the recording...

1795
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:28,268
and stretched my lower back.

1796
01:11:29,998 --> 01:11:32,058
Since she won't be around, she gave me this.

1797
01:11:35,628 --> 01:11:41,398
(Ji Hyo's second present is...)

1798
01:11:41,428 --> 01:11:47,798
(a photo album of Monday Couple.)

1799
01:11:48,058 --> 01:11:49,358
I remember this time.

1800
01:11:49,398 --> 01:11:52,898
(He remembers a photo.)

1801
01:11:52,958 --> 01:11:57,328
I remember that she said I could be such a handful.

1802
01:11:58,198 --> 01:12:00,528
I still remember her saying that.

1803
01:12:00,528 --> 01:12:02,858
You can be such a handful!

1804
01:12:03,628 --> 01:12:07,128
We have to stay together in spirit.

1805
01:12:07,128 --> 01:12:13,858
(Gary and Ji Hyo looked the best when they were together.)

1806
01:12:16,128 --> 01:12:19,098
Gary, this is Ji Hyo.

1807
01:12:20,428 --> 01:12:24,998
I was very shocked when I heard that you're leaving,

1808
01:12:25,028 --> 01:12:27,298
so I was in a daze for a few days.

1809
01:12:27,858 --> 01:12:30,268
I took for granted...

1810
01:12:30,268 --> 01:12:33,268
that until the very end, which we don't know when,

1811
01:12:33,268 --> 01:12:37,198
all of us would stay on this show.

1812
01:12:37,498 --> 01:12:39,768
Perhaps, I was lost in that belief.

1813
01:12:41,598 --> 01:12:44,268
I was upset and cried,

1814
01:12:44,628 --> 01:12:46,058
but now that I think about it,

1815
01:12:46,158 --> 01:12:49,958
I realised how difficult it must have been for you...

1816
01:12:50,398 --> 01:12:53,028
to make such a decision.

1817
01:12:53,928 --> 01:12:56,998
I'm sorry about the things that I didn't know about.

1818
01:12:56,998 --> 01:13:00,598
I felt bad thinking about how hard it must have been for you.

1819
01:13:00,658 --> 01:13:04,358
Now that you won't be where you always used to be...

1820
01:13:04,498 --> 01:13:06,898
for the last seven years, I'll feel sad and lonely,

1821
01:13:07,028 --> 01:13:09,268
but I'll stay strong.

1822
01:13:10,128 --> 01:13:11,658
"I'll stay strong."

1823
01:13:11,658 --> 01:13:14,158
"If you miss us too much,"

1824
01:13:14,158 --> 01:13:15,728
"come back any time."

1825
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:20,628
"No one can fill your place where you've been..."

1826
01:13:21,058 --> 01:13:23,528
"for the last seven years, so I'll leave it for you."

1827
01:13:24,158 --> 01:13:28,528
(They were special to each other.)

1828
01:13:28,528 --> 01:13:30,958
Hello, it's nice to see you. This is Gary.

1829
01:13:30,958 --> 01:13:34,898
I'm here to say my last farewell.

1830
01:13:34,958 --> 01:13:37,158
I was a singer...

1831
01:13:37,658 --> 01:13:40,898
that no one recognised,

1832
01:13:40,898 --> 01:13:43,158
but as I was on Running Man,

1833
01:13:43,158 --> 01:13:46,728
people started to find out about me...

1834
01:13:46,728 --> 01:13:48,428
and I received a lot of support.

1835
01:13:48,528 --> 01:13:49,858
I lacked in many ways,

1836
01:13:50,098 --> 01:13:53,928
but please keep watching Running Man since there are still...

1837
01:13:53,928 --> 01:13:56,798
other members and the staff who work hard for this show.

1838
01:13:56,858 --> 01:13:59,828
Please love the show as usual.

1839
01:13:59,858 --> 01:14:01,268
Wherever I go,

1840
01:14:01,268 --> 01:14:04,768
I'll try my best to live up to your expectations.

1841
01:14:05,268 --> 01:14:07,328
I really appreciate it. I've had a wonderful time so far.

1842
01:14:07,328 --> 01:14:08,768
Take care. Thank you.

1843
01:14:08,768 --> 01:14:10,498
(The 324 episodes, 2311 days and 77,000km with you...)

1844
01:14:10,498 --> 01:14:11,658
(won't be forgotten.)

1845
01:14:13,158 --> 01:14:17,728
(Like so, our beautiful goodbyes to Gary...)

1846
01:14:17,768 --> 01:14:19,298
(did not happen.)

1847
01:14:19,298 --> 01:14:21,558
Stop it! Leave me alone.

1848
01:14:21,558 --> 01:14:23,128
You're so mean to me.
