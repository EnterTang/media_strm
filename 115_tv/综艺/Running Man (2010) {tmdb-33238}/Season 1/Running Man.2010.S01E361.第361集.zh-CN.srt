1
00:00:04,263 --> 00:00:05,850

Last season on "Future Man"...

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,520

Whoo-ha-ha-ha!

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,273

The game is a recruitment

4
00:00:09,273 --> 00:00:10,777

and training tool sent back in time.

5
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:12,029

You're gonna help us save the world.

6
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:13,699

You're the savior.

7
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:15,202

The mission is to stop him from getting herpes,

8
00:00:15,202 --> 00:00:16,580

prevent him from becoming a scientist,

9
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:17,832

and then he never creates the cure.

10
00:00:17,832 --> 00:00:19,335

I'm really sorry, sir.

11
00:00:19,335 --> 00:00:21,464

Sorry doesn't re-swab those urethras.

12
00:00:21,464 --> 00:00:23,009

That's enough, Dr. Camillo.

13
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:24,220

I'm sorry, Dr. Kronish.

14
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,057

- Stu. - Did I take your bench?

15
00:00:26,057 --> 00:00:27,852

- I'm--I'm sorry. - No, Stu, it's me.

16
00:00:27,852 --> 00:00:29,773

What is going on with this timeline?

17
00:00:29,773 --> 00:00:32,403

Hey, hey, JFutz. You're home earls, bro.

18
00:00:32,403 --> 00:00:34,658

- My name is Jewish. - That's the Kronitorium

19
00:00:34,658 --> 00:00:35,743

where the super-cure was engineered.

20
00:00:35,743 --> 00:00:37,496

Where the Biotics were born.

21
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:39,876

No, if someone's gonna kill Kronish, it should be me.

22
00:00:39,876 --> 00:00:41,254

We'll never forget what you did here.

23
00:00:41,254 --> 00:00:43,133

When that thing goes green,

24
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:45,680

that means Kronish is dead and the final charge has been set.

25
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,433

Then, you guys get back to the future

26
00:00:47,433 --> 00:00:49,855

and do not come back for me no matter what.

27
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:56,618

I did it!

28
00:00:56,618 --> 00:00:58,371

You did it, huh?

29
00:00:58,371 --> 00:01:01,419

I take it, no word from your time-traveling pals?

30
00:01:01,419 --> 00:01:02,463

Some friends.

31
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,905

I got you now.

32
00:01:35,905 --> 00:01:38,368

That's right. Teach you to fuck with me again.

33
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:40,748

Yeah, there you go. Oh, yeah, you're struggling.

34
00:01:40,748 --> 00:01:42,752

I like that. Just gives me more power.

35
00:01:42,752 --> 00:01:44,088

Take it.

36
00:01:44,088 --> 00:01:45,298

Come on. That's right.

37
00:01:45,298 --> 00:01:47,136

There you go. How's that feel?

38
00:01:47,136 --> 00:01:49,975

Yeah, shut that big mouth once and for all.

39
00:01:49,975 --> 00:01:53,106

Tricked you with a worm, you idiot.

40
00:01:53,106 --> 00:01:54,734

That's right. I'm a man.

41
00:01:54,734 --> 00:01:56,780

You're a fish. I live in a house.

42
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,074

You live in a lake.

43
00:01:58,074 --> 00:01:59,661

There you go. Stop fighting.

44
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,832

Paul?

45
00:02:01,832 --> 00:02:04,754

Oh-ho-ho! Joosh.

46
00:02:04,754 --> 00:02:06,967

You know, this--this fishing game,

47
00:02:06,967 --> 00:02:08,596

this is one of the best fishing games ever I ever played,

48
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:11,392

and I've played a shitload of fishing games.

49
00:02:11,392 --> 00:02:13,021

Not on my work time. On my private time.

50
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:14,190

You know, I would never do anything

51
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,610

while I'm working for you, sir.

52
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,532

Okay, cool. Uh, one question though.

53
00:02:18,532 --> 00:02:19,993

How am I here?

54
00:02:19,993 --> 00:02:22,832

The last thing I remember, I was in prison,

55
00:02:22,832 --> 00:02:24,586

- and there was this--- Big, flash of light, right?

56
00:02:24,586 --> 00:02:26,339

Wait, how do you know that?

57
00:02:28,384 --> 00:02:29,846

It happened again.

58
00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:33,979

What?

59
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:35,650

Let's go over it one more time.

60
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,194

When you were in prison,

61
00:02:37,194 --> 00:02:38,864

you started seeing these flashes of light,

62
00:02:38,864 --> 00:02:40,492

and, uh, having seizures.

63
00:02:40,492 --> 00:02:42,037

- Okay. - Yeah, it was terrible.

64
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,707

You know, gave you complete memory loss.

65
00:02:43,707 --> 00:02:45,210

Doctor's figured out it was

66
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,964

because of the nuts in your prison food.

67
00:02:46,964 --> 00:02:48,258

Yeah, I mean, I have a nut allergy,

68
00:02:48,258 --> 00:02:50,011

but it doesn't give me seizures.

69
00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:52,767

Well, you have too many nuts, you shake like a maraca.

70
00:02:52,767 --> 00:02:54,270

So the prison had to decide

71
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,940

whether or not to hire you a private chef

72
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,694

or send you home under house arrest.

73
00:02:57,694 --> 00:02:59,321

But they figured, you know,

74
00:02:59,321 --> 00:03:00,908

hiring a private chef for "The Krona-bomber,"

75
00:03:00,908 --> 00:03:02,829

that's a PR nightmare. So they sent you home.

76
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:04,415

And that wasn't a PR nightmare?

77
00:03:04,415 --> 00:03:06,294

It's kind of like a pick-your-poison thing.

78
00:03:06,294 --> 00:03:08,089

You know, 'cause now you're eating nut-free meals,

79
00:03:08,089 --> 00:03:09,466

but occasionally, you'll see these flashes of light,

80
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:11,220

and then you'll forget everything,

81
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,807

and I gotta explain it to you, and it's super boring.

82
00:03:12,807 --> 00:03:14,936

I've, like, told you this story, like, 15 times.

83
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:20,907

Okay, and--and you and Tracy still work for me?

84
00:03:20,907 --> 00:03:24,204

No, yeah, Tracy had a problem working for a terrorist.

85
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,541

Me, not so much.

86
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:26,960

As long as the checks clear,

87
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,379

I'm your man, JFutz.

88
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,008

Mmm.

89
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,895

But if I'm on house arrest,

90
00:03:35,895 --> 00:03:37,815

why don't I have an ankle bracelet on.

91
00:03:37,815 --> 00:03:40,028

I mean, what's to stop me from just walking out the door?

92
00:03:42,992 --> 00:03:45,915

The bullet I'd put in the back of your skull.

93
00:03:45,915 --> 00:03:47,669

Just kidding.

94
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:49,923

I'd just pop your knee clean out.

95
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,764

Paulie, is he seizing up again?

96
00:03:53,764 --> 00:03:55,810

Yeah, we got a regular Lucy Whitmore over here.

97
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,272

That's a character portrayed by Drew Barrymore

98
00:03:58,272 --> 00:04:00,443

in the film "50 First Dates."

99
00:04:00,443 --> 00:04:01,738

Please don't tell me you forgot that.

100
00:04:01,738 --> 00:04:03,366

So you're...

101
00:04:03,366 --> 00:04:06,080

- like, my personal guard now? - Bingo.

102
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,544

Whoa, "Vermont Fishing Hole."

103
00:04:08,544 --> 00:04:10,548

Hey, any nibbles, Paulie?

104
00:04:10,548 --> 00:04:12,593

Pull up a pole. Find out yourself, my friend.

105
00:04:12,593 --> 00:04:15,265

Wait, wait, hang on a second. That doesn't make any sense.

106
00:04:15,265 --> 00:04:18,353

Prisons have to deal with food allergies on a daily basis.

107
00:04:18,353 --> 00:04:20,108

There must be thousands of options

108
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:21,695

that are--that are better than sending me home.

109
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:23,866

I'm a convicted terrorist.

110
00:04:23,866 --> 00:04:26,538

I was given 101 consecutive life sentences,

111
00:04:26,538 --> 00:04:29,251

and "USA Today" said that I was the most hated man in America.

112
00:04:29,251 --> 00:04:31,213

Ooh, and the "New York Post" dubbed you Little Boy Blue.

113
00:04:31,213 --> 00:04:33,176

B-L-E-W.

114
00:04:33,176 --> 00:04:34,846

'Cause you blew up the building.

115
00:04:34,846 --> 00:04:37,309

And you're small in stature.

116
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,791

Okay, so the terrorist gets the door.

117
00:05:03,529 --> 00:05:05,240

Oh, shit, peonies!

118
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,618

I didn't know they were in season.

119
00:05:06,618 --> 00:05:09,289

Neither did I.

120
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:13,131

I'm gonna have to pick up some of those for the widow Santiago.

121
00:05:15,426 --> 00:05:17,932

Stu Camillo?

122
00:05:17,932 --> 00:05:20,270

Stuart Gavin Camillo?

123
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,982

Ooh, who's that? Old flame?

124
00:05:21,982 --> 00:05:23,735

No, it's a guy that I used to work with,

125
00:05:23,735 --> 00:05:26,240

but I have no idea why he would send me flowers.

126
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,413

Hmm, but why do you think he might send you flowers?

127
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:31,333

I don't know.

128
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,922

I just thought he always kind of hated me.

129
00:05:33,922 --> 00:05:37,429

Objection. Speculation.

130
00:05:37,429 --> 00:05:39,517

Yeah, hmm.

131
00:05:39,517 --> 00:05:40,936

Why does this guy hate you?

132
00:05:40,936 --> 00:05:42,815

I really don't know.

133
00:05:42,815 --> 00:05:44,193

He was just always a dick to me.

134
00:05:44,193 --> 00:05:46,155

Really? For no reason?

135
00:05:46,155 --> 00:05:47,407

Wh--why do you care?

136
00:05:47,407 --> 00:05:48,785

Don't you find it curious

137
00:05:48,785 --> 00:05:50,998

that a man you considered "a dick"

138
00:05:50,998 --> 00:05:53,921

would purchase this tasteful floral arrangement?

139
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:56,801

Clearly this isn't a gas station impulse buy.

140
00:05:56,801 --> 00:05:58,722

Yeah, these are Majorcan peonies.

141
00:05:58,722 --> 00:06:00,225

You know what the street value of these are?

142
00:06:00,225 --> 00:06:01,561

I don't. No.

143
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:02,939

12.50 a bulb.

144
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:05,318

Mm-hmm.

145
00:06:05,318 --> 00:06:08,157

I think I'm gonna go upstairs and lie down a little.

146
00:06:08,157 --> 00:06:10,245

- This is all just sort of--- Wait.

147
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,917

Don't you wanna write him a thank you note first?

148
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:14,671

Yeah.

149
00:06:14,671 --> 00:06:17,008

Etiquette dictates, when someone sends you flowers,

150
00:06:17,008 --> 00:06:19,137

- you write them a thank you. - Since when?

151
00:06:19,137 --> 00:06:20,724

Everyone knows you gotta write a note

152
00:06:20,724 --> 00:06:22,561

before the last petal falls.

153
00:06:22,561 --> 00:06:24,649

I don't wanna say anything to Stu.

154
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:26,193

Okay, fine, fine. I'll write it.

155
00:06:26,193 --> 00:06:27,822

"Dear Stu,

156
00:06:27,822 --> 00:06:31,788

thank you for the magnificent Majorcan peonies."

157
00:06:31,788 --> 00:06:33,625

Now I'd like to add something personal.

158
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,879

Maybe, like, a little inside joke that you and Stu share.

159
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,591

- What would that be? - What is the deal

160
00:06:37,591 --> 00:06:38,885

with you guys and Stu?

161
00:06:38,885 --> 00:06:40,723

I-I barely even knew the guy.

162
00:06:40,723 --> 00:06:42,893

Whoa, hey. Calm down, man.

163
00:06:42,893 --> 00:06:44,939

Yeah.

164
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:49,114

You're all getting defensive about this Camillo fella.

165
00:06:49,114 --> 00:06:51,452

- What does he have on you? - Or you on him?

166
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,414

Nothing! I don't know what the fuck you're talking about!

167
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:55,293

Answer our questions about Stu Camillo

168
00:06:55,293 --> 00:06:57,172

- and this will all be over. - Stop.

169
00:06:57,172 --> 00:06:58,842

Stop! Stop walking at me!

170
00:07:00,094 --> 00:07:01,514

- Sup. - Hey.

171
00:07:01,514 --> 00:07:03,267

Die, resistance scum!

172
00:07:06,106 --> 00:07:07,777

- Who--- Ninja star.

173
00:07:18,632 --> 00:07:20,426

I give that entrance...

174
00:07:20,426 --> 00:07:22,180

two stars.

175
00:07:28,652 --> 00:07:31,073

What the hell is happening, guys?

176
00:07:31,073 --> 00:07:32,492

Skarsgaard and Paul were Biotics?

177
00:07:32,492 --> 00:07:35,248

- I thought we saved the future. - We did.

178
00:07:35,248 --> 00:07:36,668

It's the present that's in danger.

179
00:07:36,668 --> 00:07:38,087

Your present.

180
00:07:38,087 --> 00:07:40,424

Nice pj's. All right.

181
00:07:40,424 --> 00:07:42,428

Before we blew up the Kronitorium,

182
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,600

Biotics executed murder protocol one.

183
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,105

Oh, I don't like how that sounds at all.

184
00:07:47,105 --> 00:07:48,942

Yeah, no, you shouldn't.

185
00:07:48,942 --> 00:07:50,779

They activated every Biotic sleeper agent in the world

186
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:52,240

for one singular mission.

187
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,244

- Killing you. - What?

188
00:07:54,244 --> 00:07:56,583

Wh-wh-why? I'm being John Wicked?

189
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:57,877

They must have sent your picture out

190
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,462

before we blew up the lab.

191
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:01,926

Call it the last gasp of a dying civilization.

192
00:08:01,926 --> 00:08:04,724

Okay, but--but the future you guys went back to...?

193
00:08:04,724 --> 00:08:06,978

Oh, it's perfect. Everything we dreamed of.

194
00:08:06,978 --> 00:08:08,732

- Really? - Yeah.

195
00:08:08,732 --> 00:08:12,113

It's a utopia inside of a paradise.

196
00:08:12,113 --> 00:08:13,742

We have robot butlers.

197
00:08:13,742 --> 00:08:15,453

- Tiger, that's--- No, don't worry. Don't worry.

198
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,290

Don't worry. They're programmed not to turn on us.

199
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,837

Wow.

200
00:08:19,837 --> 00:08:22,133

We--we saved the world.

201
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:25,431

You know, when I was in prison, I-I hoped against hope

202
00:08:25,431 --> 00:08:28,772

and--and it kept me going, but...

203
00:08:28,772 --> 00:08:31,736

but knowing for sure...

204
00:08:31,736 --> 00:08:33,530

That makes everything we went through worth it.

205
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,866

Yeah.

206
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,207

Wait. If the future was perfect,

207
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:40,419

then why--why'd you guys come back for me?

208
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,048

'Cause you were in trouble, little buddy.

209
00:08:42,048 --> 00:08:43,842

We--we looked up what happened to you.

210
00:08:43,842 --> 00:08:46,849

Oh, man, it was tough livin' our lives

211
00:08:46,849 --> 00:08:49,271

knowing those two had killed you so horrifically.

212
00:08:49,271 --> 00:08:51,441

Yeah, you see, first rule of murder protocol one

213
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:54,699

is to disrespect the body. So...

214
00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:56,201

Yeah.

215
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:57,287

- Mm. -

216
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,707

Where are my ears?

217
00:08:58,707 --> 00:09:00,293

Oh, no, they're right...

218
00:09:00,293 --> 00:09:01,796

- there--there they are. - Yeah.

219
00:09:01,796 --> 00:09:03,550

Right inside that.

220
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,219

- So... - Oh, God. Okay.

221
00:09:05,219 --> 00:09:06,764

No teammate of ours is gonna die like that.

222
00:09:06,764 --> 00:09:08,392

- No. - No, no, no.

223
00:09:08,392 --> 00:09:11,106

- Thank you, guys. - Hey, do you have any food?

224
00:09:11,106 --> 00:09:12,860

Yeah.

225
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,907

Mmm, what the hell did you do to these vegetables?

226
00:09:15,907 --> 00:09:17,661

I poached 'em in duck fat.

227
00:09:17,661 --> 00:09:19,497

Mmm.

228
00:09:19,497 --> 00:09:21,043

That was so good.

229
00:09:21,043 --> 00:09:22,880

I can't remember the last time I had real food.

230
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,800

Well, get used to it.

231
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,888

I'm gonna be cooking like this all the time.

232
00:09:26,888 --> 00:09:29,852

Using fresh local ingredients wherever we go.

233
00:09:29,852 --> 00:09:31,606

Go?

234
00:09:31,606 --> 00:09:32,983

I mean, shouldn't I be, like, laying low and hiding out

235
00:09:32,983 --> 00:09:34,361

if Biotics are hunting me?

236
00:09:34,361 --> 00:09:35,906

And wait for them to come to us?

237
00:09:35,906 --> 00:09:37,492

Fuck no. We're bringing the fight to them.

238
00:09:37,492 --> 00:09:39,622

Yeah, they're spread all around the world.

239
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:42,377

From the white sand beaches of Rio de Janeiro

240
00:09:42,377 --> 00:09:44,381

to the Great Pyramids of Giza.

241
00:09:44,381 --> 00:09:47,721

We're gonna go to all those places?

242
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:49,099

How--how many sleepers are left?

243
00:09:49,099 --> 00:09:51,186

Well, after this little episode, 12.

244
00:09:51,186 --> 00:09:54,025

Each in a location more exotic than the last.

245
00:09:54,025 --> 00:09:56,698

You know, I-I sort of just feel like

246
00:09:56,698 --> 00:09:58,492

bringing me to them might be putting me

247
00:09:58,492 --> 00:10:00,204

in, like, unnecessary danger, and...

248
00:10:00,204 --> 00:10:02,710

Well, that's where things get real interesting.

249
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,632

- Yeah. - Because once you inject this,

250
00:10:05,632 --> 00:10:07,176

they'll be the ones in danger.

251
00:10:07,176 --> 00:10:08,805

CATG-6,

252
00:10:08,805 --> 00:10:10,976

aka Globyplast Nine,

253
00:10:10,976 --> 00:10:14,190

aka Super Serum 14.

254
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,779

It's gonna make you faster, smarter, stronger,

255
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:18,449

and you'll be able to walk into a room

256
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:21,831

and feel instantly confident no matter the situation.

257
00:10:21,831 --> 00:10:22,958

Oh, yeah.

258
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,502

- Really? - Yeah.

259
00:10:27,216 --> 00:10:28,887

This is awesome.

260
00:10:28,887 --> 00:10:31,183

Ha, this is incredible. We're gonna be kicking ass

261
00:10:31,183 --> 00:10:33,061

side by side just the three of us.

262
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:34,690

- Well... - Not exactly.

263
00:10:41,495 --> 00:10:43,040

Got the shield-sphere up.

264
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,668

Should keep us off their scanners for now.

265
00:10:44,668 --> 00:10:47,298

They'll be four of us. Meet Fox, new tech expert.

266
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:49,762

She may look like a nerd, but you'll be glad to have her

267
00:10:49,762 --> 00:10:51,264

when she hacks us into the Kremlin.

268
00:11:00,742 --> 00:11:03,038

Hi. Futturman.

269
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:04,917

Josh Futturman.

270
00:11:04,917 --> 00:11:06,838

Welcome to my time.

271
00:11:06,838 --> 00:11:09,259

With a little bit of luck, maybe it'll become yours.

272
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:10,971

I like the click of your keyboard.

273
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:13,893

But be careful, my spell check doesn't miss a word.

274
00:11:13,893 --> 00:11:15,271

Oh, we'll have to

275
00:11:15,271 --> 00:11:16,858

antidisestablishmentarianism that.

276
00:11:16,858 --> 00:11:19,572

- Serum's working. - Instant chemistry.

277
00:11:19,572 --> 00:11:22,786

All right, I triangulated the location of our first target.

278
00:11:22,786 --> 00:11:25,082

The ICEHOTEL in Helsinki.

279
00:11:25,082 --> 00:11:26,711

Ah, yeah, I've always wanted to visit.

280
00:11:26,711 --> 00:11:29,090

Well, you better pack a parka and a tuxedo.

281
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,844

This is a shadow op. Threat level nine.

282
00:11:30,844 --> 00:11:32,388

You two will be posing as newlyweds

283
00:11:32,388 --> 00:11:34,142

infiltrating a Nordic sex cult.

284
00:11:34,142 --> 00:11:36,479

Murder protocol one dictates to kill on sight.

285
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:37,900

No questions asked.

286
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,653

We're really gonna have to sell newlyweds

287
00:11:39,653 --> 00:11:41,489

with insatiable sexual appetites.

288
00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:44,037

Are you up for that?

289
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,957

I mean, yes, I will try.

290
00:11:47,753 --> 00:11:50,382

Wait. Did you say kill on sight,

291
00:11:50,382 --> 00:11:52,136

- no questions asked? - Yeah.

292
00:11:52,136 --> 00:11:53,973

Because those two asked me a bunch of questions.

293
00:11:53,973 --> 00:11:55,560

- What're you talking about? - This whole morning,

294
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,229

they could have just killed me, and instead,

295
00:11:57,229 --> 00:11:58,650

they asked me a bunch of questions about Stu Camillo.

296
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,402

Why would they ask about Stu?

297
00:12:00,402 --> 00:12:02,574

I don't know, but they were extremely persistent.

298
00:12:02,574 --> 00:12:04,578

No, I don't like this one bit. What're they planning?

299
00:12:04,578 --> 00:12:06,498

If they're breaking MP1, it must be important.

300
00:12:06,498 --> 00:12:08,293

Fox, hack into the Internet.

301
00:12:08,293 --> 00:12:10,339

Find out everything you can about Stu Camillo.

302
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:11,509

Already on it.

303
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,769

You didn't tell 'em anything important about Stu, did you?

304
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,856

Oh, no, no, no, I don't know anything important about Stu.

305
00:12:18,856 --> 00:12:20,694

- What does he have on you? - Or you on him?

306
00:12:22,446 --> 00:12:24,785

- What does he have on you? - Or you on him?

307
00:12:31,882 --> 00:12:33,594

Uh, nothing. No, no, nothing.

308
00:12:33,594 --> 00:12:35,264

Um...

309
00:12:35,264 --> 00:12:37,309

but I did just remember that I--

310
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:40,232

I think I have a Patagonia gift card upstairs in my room,

311
00:12:40,232 --> 00:12:42,863

I'm gonna go grab it, gear up for Helsinki.

312
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:45,284

Back in a jiff.

313
00:12:45,284 --> 00:12:47,706

Okay, Futz.

314
00:12:47,706 --> 00:12:50,169

I know you got it somewhere.

315
00:12:59,688 --> 00:13:01,107

Spoink!

316
00:13:06,326 --> 00:13:08,288

What the fuck is happening?

317
00:13:13,173 --> 00:13:14,968

Oh, Josh, come on.

318
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:17,098

We're finding all kinds of great stuff here on the Internet.

319
00:13:17,098 --> 00:13:19,561

Cool. Hey, um...

320
00:13:19,561 --> 00:13:21,356

you know, I just thought of something

321
00:13:21,356 --> 00:13:23,736

that actually might be really useful about Stu.

322
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,532

Really, what?

323
00:13:25,532 --> 00:13:27,828

It was something that you told me that he told you

324
00:13:27,828 --> 00:13:29,330

when you guys went on that date.

325
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,794

Remember? The whale watching date?

326
00:13:31,794 --> 00:13:33,840

Yeah, well, he said a lot of things,

327
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,552

so what specifically?

328
00:13:35,552 --> 00:13:37,471

Yeah, I can't remember.

329
00:13:37,471 --> 00:13:39,392

You said it was something that was really, really important,

330
00:13:39,392 --> 00:13:42,858

and he told you right before the humpback charged your boat.

331
00:13:42,858 --> 00:13:44,443

Well, to be honest, after I saw that angry spout,

332
00:13:44,443 --> 00:13:45,989

- it just all went blank. - Wrong.

333
00:13:45,989 --> 00:13:48,201

You've never seen a spout.

334
00:13:48,201 --> 00:13:50,289

You are never this nice to me.

335
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:51,792

And you?

336
00:13:51,792 --> 00:13:53,629

You're Spoink girl.

337
00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:56,301

What the fuck is going on? Somebody give me some answers.

338
00:13:56,301 --> 00:13:58,054

This will all be over soon.

339
00:13:58,054 --> 00:14:00,100

Just tell us why you would be a threat to Stu Camillo?

340
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,148

- You must know his weakness. - Some of his secrets?

341
00:14:03,148 --> 00:14:05,319

I don't know anything about Stu Camillo, okay?

342
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:07,323

He's a tertiary character in my life.

343
00:14:07,323 --> 00:14:09,118

- Tell us! - He's tertiary!

344
00:14:09,118 --> 00:14:11,289

- God damn it! - Start talking.

345
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:12,626

- Now! - He's tertiar--

346
00:14:12,626 --> 00:14:17,051

he's tertiary!

347
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:41,725

I told you not to repeat the question sequencing.

348
00:14:41,725 --> 00:14:43,228

You made him suspicious. Geez, you're worse than Hera.

349
00:14:43,228 --> 00:14:44,480

- Don't compare me to Hera. - Too late.

350
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,486

How long until the simulation reboots?

351
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:48,990

I don't know. He glitched the whole thing.

352
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,618

Glitched it? He crashed it.

353
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,795

Oh, shit.

354
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:57,924

We're gonna need Apollo.

355
00:15:30,782 --> 00:15:32,409

- It's okay. -

356
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:34,831

You're safe now.

357
00:15:34,831 --> 00:15:36,459

Let me get this neuro-cap off you.

358
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:37,921

You'll be a lot more comfortable.

359
00:15:37,921 --> 00:15:40,342

Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

360
00:15:42,972 --> 00:15:44,851

What the hell was that? Where am I?

361
00:15:44,851 --> 00:15:46,647
那是由你自我意识
That was a simulation

362
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:48,233
而形成的模拟场景
crafted from your own consciousness,

363
00:15:48,233 --> 00:15:51,824
不过能由外部操作者控制
but controlled by outside operators.

364
00:15:51,824 --> 00:15:53,368

And you are in a cave.

365
00:15:57,292 --> 00:15:59,505

ATHENA: Don't squirm.

366
00:15:59,505 --> 00:16:02,094

It only makes the cerebro-derm stickier.

367
00:16:06,185 --> 00:16:07,689

I-I-I can't--

368
00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:09,441

I can't remember coming here.

369
00:16:09,441 --> 00:16:12,030

We had to remove a small portion of your memory

370
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,285

so you would not suspect you were in a sim.

371
00:16:18,794 --> 00:16:20,631

Don't worry. It's just spinal fluid.

372
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,772

There. Good as new.

373
00:16:28,772 --> 00:16:32,697

No, bad. Bad. Still bad.

374
00:16:32,697 --> 00:16:34,993

Who--who are you?

375
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:37,039

What the fuck is going on?

376
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,584

My name is Athena

377
00:16:38,584 --> 00:16:40,128

and I'm sorry you had to go through that.

378
00:16:40,128 --> 00:16:42,382

I assure you, it was for your own safety.

379
00:16:42,382 --> 00:16:44,345

The truth is so shocking,

380
00:16:44,345 --> 00:16:47,602

we felt a simulation was a more humane way to ease you into it.

381
00:16:47,602 --> 00:16:50,608

I really think you should lie down for this.

382
00:16:52,236 --> 00:16:54,866

Just come on.

383
00:16:54,866 --> 00:16:56,494

Okay.

384
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,212

I am from the future.

385
00:17:02,548 --> 00:17:04,134

And...

386
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:09,395

Okay.

387
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:12,192

My comrades and I traveled back in time to find you

388
00:17:12,192 --> 00:17:13,904

because we believe you may be

389
00:17:13,904 --> 00:17:17,160

the only person with the skills to save our world.

390
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,500

A savior. I know, it boggles the mind.

391
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,296

But you must believe me.

392
00:17:22,296 --> 00:17:25,553

In 2026, Dr. Stu Camillo will create

393
00:17:25,553 --> 00:17:27,431

a super-cure for all diseases,

394
00:17:27,431 --> 00:17:29,268

leading to a global war...

395
00:17:29,268 --> 00:17:31,773

between the ones who receive the cure and the ones who don't?

396
00:17:31,773 --> 00:17:33,234

Well, yes, exactly, but there's no way

397
00:17:33,234 --> 00:17:34,738

you could possibly know that.

398
00:17:34,738 --> 00:17:38,286

Yeah, I know it because I lived it.

399
00:17:38,286 --> 00:17:40,916

God damn it. It didn't work.

400
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,837

I don't understand.

401
00:17:46,052 --> 00:17:47,930

I fought...

402
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:50,978

I struggled, I suffered, I sacrificed,

403
00:17:50,978 --> 00:17:53,066

I saw a girl's head get blown up in my face,

404
00:17:53,066 --> 00:17:55,696

and I end up in the exact same place.

405
00:17:58,076 --> 00:18:01,248

Okay, so... Stu is the new Kronish.

406
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:04,254

Same shit, different fucking timeline.

407
00:18:04,254 --> 00:18:06,175

So you're a Time Warrior?

408
00:18:10,016 --> 00:18:12,354

Yeah.

409
00:18:12,354 --> 00:18:13,857

Yeah, I guess you could say that.

410
00:18:13,857 --> 00:18:16,738

Then you know the stakes we face.

411
00:18:16,738 --> 00:18:18,867

The fate of humanity is in the balance.

412
00:18:18,867 --> 00:18:22,416

- We need you. - No.

413
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,086

You know, after spending a year

414
00:18:24,086 --> 00:18:26,967

in the prison for the criminally insane...

415
00:18:26,967 --> 00:18:29,973

for apparently no reason...

416
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:33,396

I don't really feel like being a savior anymore.

417
00:18:35,693 --> 00:18:37,572

I've upset you.

418
00:18:37,572 --> 00:18:40,118

That's the last thing I wanted to do.

419
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:42,122

Rest.

420
00:18:57,779 --> 00:18:59,741

Seriously?

421
00:18:59,741 --> 00:19:01,870

Great way to treat your savior. Thank you.

422
00:19:17,944 --> 00:19:20,908

Here. Eat something.

423
00:19:20,908 --> 00:19:22,410

I'm not hungry.

424
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,206

Being in the sim cranks your metabolism

425
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:26,043

14.6 times normal.

426
00:19:26,043 --> 00:19:27,420

You're in a caloric freefall,

427
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,676

you risk hypo-auto-cannibalization.

428
00:19:29,676 --> 00:19:31,513

Oh, all right. How about this?

429
00:19:31,513 --> 00:19:33,684

How about I start by gnawing on my fucking leg?

430
00:19:33,684 --> 00:19:35,729

Why am I shackled to the bed?

431
00:19:35,729 --> 00:19:37,440

The restraint is for your safety.

432
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,446

I once saw a man flail so violently

433
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:42,325

from post-sim hallucinations,

434
00:19:42,325 --> 00:19:44,246

he shattered his femur.

435
00:19:44,246 --> 00:19:46,585

The jagged bone ripped right through the meat of his thigh.

436
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:49,006

All right, fine. Just leave it on.

437
00:19:51,595 --> 00:19:53,431

Easy on the liquids.

438
00:19:53,431 --> 00:19:57,147

The tranq we gave you can lead to bladder control issues.

439
00:19:57,147 --> 00:19:59,109

I play a lot of video games, okay.

440
00:19:59,109 --> 00:20:02,157

- I have no problem holding my U. - Understood.

441
00:20:02,157 --> 00:20:03,994

You know, putting me in that sim

442
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,956

and making me think that I'd saved the world was pretty mean.

443
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:07,877

We didn't make you think you saved the world.

444
00:20:07,877 --> 00:20:10,506

That part was a projection of your own subconscious.

445
00:20:10,506 --> 00:20:12,511

All we controlled were the questions about Stu.

446
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:14,181

- You filled in the rest. - So you--

447
00:20:14,181 --> 00:20:15,643

you hijacked my brain

448
00:20:15,643 --> 00:20:17,312

just to ask me questions about Stu Camillo?

449
00:20:17,312 --> 00:20:20,569

Yes, but the simulation told us so much more.

450
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:23,449

We thought it was something you knew.

451
00:20:23,449 --> 00:20:25,328

It turns out it's something you are.

452
00:20:29,044 --> 00:20:30,589

What am I?

453
00:20:30,589 --> 00:20:32,342

That's what we're here to find out.

454
00:20:32,342 --> 00:20:36,685

There's a power in you greater than any we've ever seen.

455
00:20:36,685 --> 00:20:38,647

Like--like, a super power?

456
00:20:38,647 --> 00:20:40,526

Exactly.

457
00:20:40,526 --> 00:20:42,320

Now, I understand you've been through

458
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,865

something like this before,

459
00:20:43,865 --> 00:20:46,621

and I know why you're hesitant to try it again,

460
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:48,959

but if you'll join us, I promise you,

461
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:50,294

it'll be different this time.

462
00:20:50,294 --> 00:20:52,758

You won't end up behind bars.

463
00:20:52,758 --> 00:20:55,514

You'll end up in the history books

464
00:20:55,514 --> 00:20:59,104

as the greatest hero the world has ever known.

465
00:21:00,733 --> 00:21:02,653

- And if I say no? - We'll wipe your memory

466
00:21:02,653 --> 00:21:04,031

and put you right back in prison.

467
00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:05,868

- You can do that? - Of course.

468
00:21:05,868 --> 00:21:07,538

The only side effect would be

469
00:21:07,538 --> 00:21:09,625

the lingering sensation that something was off,

470
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,503

but you would never really be able to tell what it was.

471
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,424

It would just be there gnawing at you,

472
00:21:13,424 --> 00:21:15,470

never more than a shadow.

473
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,182

That--that sounds like it would drive me insane.

474
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:22,192

Okay.

475
00:21:22,192 --> 00:21:23,904

Okay, if I do this,

476
00:21:23,904 --> 00:21:26,576

it is not to make it into the history books.

477
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:30,291

It's to make sure there's still a history to be written about.

478
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,755

Inside of history books.

479
00:21:32,755 --> 00:21:34,801

Well said, Joosh.

480
00:21:34,801 --> 00:21:39,184

So, does that mean you're in?

481
00:21:39,184 --> 00:21:41,523

Call me Josh.

482
00:21:41,523 --> 00:21:42,775

I'm in.

483
00:21:42,775 --> 00:21:45,404

Welcome to the Pointed Circle.

484
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:47,408

Pointed Circle. That's a cool name.

485
00:21:47,408 --> 00:21:49,204

Oh, that also...

486
00:21:49,204 --> 00:21:52,586

explains the, uh, pointed circle.

487
00:21:52,586 --> 00:21:54,674

Yeah.

488
00:21:54,674 --> 00:21:57,137

There are some others who are going to want to meet you:

489
00:21:57,137 --> 00:22:00,268

- Odin, Vishnu, Muluku, Xenu. - Yeah, I, uh, would love

490
00:22:00,268 --> 00:22:01,896

to meet the--the whole--the whole gang.

491
00:22:01,896 --> 00:22:03,399

And as a member of the Pointed Circle,

492
00:22:03,399 --> 00:22:04,861

you'll need a code name as well.

493
00:22:04,861 --> 00:22:06,823

Okay.

494
00:22:06,823 --> 00:22:08,450

How does Jesus sound to you?

495
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:11,875

It's a little risky.

496
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,004

Mm, Allah?

497
00:22:14,004 --> 00:22:16,091

Good.

498
00:22:16,091 --> 00:22:17,385

Eat your supper.

499
00:22:17,385 --> 00:22:18,889

I'll return soon with the others.

500
00:22:30,537 --> 00:22:32,917

Oh.

501
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:34,670

Oh, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

502
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,298

Stop, stop, stop, stop.

503
00:22:36,298 --> 00:22:38,803

Shit. Shit.

504
00:22:39,847 --> 00:22:42,728

I can't meet Xenu like this. This is disgusting.

505
00:22:44,982 --> 00:22:47,070

Sheets.

506
00:23:25,522 --> 00:23:27,150

Joosh is on board.

507
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:30,699

We need all techs working on an upload machine.

508
00:23:30,699 --> 00:23:32,368

You're so convinced this'll work,

509
00:23:32,368 --> 00:23:35,041

but how do you know he's the one?

510
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:36,501

He crashed the simulation

511
00:23:36,501 --> 00:23:38,339

in less than ten minutes.

512
00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:41,053

We harness that power and use it to bring down the entire system,

513
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:42,931

- then we strike. - The attack is on Launch Day.

514
00:23:42,931 --> 00:23:44,894

We'll need to weaponize him before then.

515
00:23:44,894 --> 00:23:46,689

It'll take some time to replicate the induction cortex.

516
00:23:46,689 --> 00:23:48,067

You'll have to keep him calm till then.

517
00:23:48,067 --> 00:23:50,279

- That won't be a problem. - Okay.

518
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:52,492

'Cause this procedure will 100% kill him.

519
00:23:52,492 --> 00:23:54,120

"Kill him"? ATHENA: Soldiers die

520
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,083

for lesser causes. His death will be the first,

521
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:59,130

but it won't be the last. A war is coming.

522
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,343

It's time we took back control.

523
00:24:09,317 --> 00:24:10,612

Oh, God. They're gonna kill me.

524
00:24:20,924 --> 00:24:24,305

Lefty-loosey, righty-tighty, lefty-loosey.

525
00:24:25,976 --> 00:24:28,105

Righty-tighty, lefty-loosey.

526
00:24:39,461 --> 00:24:41,423

Nighty-night.

527
00:24:52,195 --> 00:24:53,990

You left the door open?

528
00:24:58,207 --> 00:24:59,292

When they ripped out your tongue,

529
00:24:59,292 --> 00:25:00,795

did they get your brain too?

530
00:25:00,795 --> 00:25:02,841

ATHENA: You know what?

531
00:25:02,841 --> 00:25:04,469

Don't. Spread out.

532
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:06,849

Search the halls. He can't have gotten far.

533
00:25:06,849 --> 00:25:08,310

Achilles will hear of this.

534
00:25:11,316 --> 00:25:13,905

Jesus.

535
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:40,959

God it stinks in here.

536
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:42,671

Yeah, I know. This cave is nasty.

537
00:25:42,671 --> 00:25:44,550

I don't like it.

538
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:47,054

You know last week, I caught Apollo pissing in that corner?

539
00:25:47,054 --> 00:25:49,643

I do not let him near me.

540
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,188

TTD.

541
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:24,672

Did you hear that? Osiris, Ganesh, check that out.

542
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,437

Hachi machi.
