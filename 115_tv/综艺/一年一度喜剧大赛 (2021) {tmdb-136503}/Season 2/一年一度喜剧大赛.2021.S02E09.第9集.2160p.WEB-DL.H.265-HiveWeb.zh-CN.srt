I've been looking into your funding,

153
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,170
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}作为研究机构  你似乎有很多捐助人
and you seem to have a lot of benefactors for a research institute.

Yeah, but your benefactors - I can't seem to find any of them.

156
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,990
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}原因很简单
Very simple reason for that.

157
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,550
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}我把他们都杀了  埋在我家后院
I killed them all, buried them in my back yard.

158
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,430
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}你家后院有多大  布洛克先生
How big is your back yard, Mr Brock?

159
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,330

At the last count, Wyoming.

160
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,570
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}如果诸位不介意的话
Now, if you good people will excuse me,

161
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,100
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}这位女士将送诸位至出口

162
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,150
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}布洛克先生

163
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,410
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}布洛克先生

164
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,810
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}布洛克先生  布洛克先生
Mr Brock? Mr Brock.

165
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,590
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}显然  这位还有一个问题
Apparently we have one more question.

166
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,930
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}是的  请问男厕在哪儿
Yes. Where's the little boys' room?

167
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,690
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}你可以在出去路上的左侧找到洗手间
I think you'll find the restrooms to the left, on your way out.

No, not the restrooms, the little boys' room.

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}我又不想休息
I don't want a rest.

173
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,780
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}如果大家都只是去休息  我会搞出事情的
If everyone's just having a rest, I might cause an incident.

174
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,960
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}辛姆博士  有问题吗
Dr Sim, is there a problem?

175

It's the brains. There's something I need to show you.

Mr Brock. You startled me.

180
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,600
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}咱们走吧

181
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,040

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}我看到了脑子
I see brains...

186
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,420
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}到处都是  除了你脑瓜里
every place except here.

187
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,430
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}这些标本是我们的捐助者捐赠到这里的
These specimens were donated to this facility by our benefactors,

188
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,920
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}为的是一个高度机密的研究项目
for a top-secret research project.

189

A project which is not to be questioned, impeded,

190
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:06,070
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}甚至不能和任何
or in fact mentioned by any of the employees

191
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,800
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}和谐浅滩研究院的职员提及
of the Harmony Shoal Institute.

192
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,180
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}就连我都没有权限知道这里的事情
Even I don't have the clearance to know what's going on in here.

193
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,900
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}-但为什么  -你的工作不是问问题
- But why? - It's not your job to ask questions!

194
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,620
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}专注研究就行了
Stick to science.

195
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,010
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}你的眼睛出问题了吗
Something wrong with your eyes?

Well, I guess they've got the space.

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}你没懂  没有任何物流记录
You don't understand. There have been no deliveries.

207
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,080
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}有点蓝  但是是因为液体的缘故对吧
Kind of blue, I guess, but that's the fluid, right?

208
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,530
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}对  是那液体

You don't get paid for saving people.

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}和谐浅滩的复仇在五恒星系统中
The vengeance of Harmony Shoal is known and feared

945

You're not the only one that's full of it.

I mean, life's not a comic book, right, Doctor?

958
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:34,130
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}这问题不应该问我
Possibly I'm not the right person to ask.

959
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:35,680
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}万一又出什么事呢

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}她叫什么

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}我肯定我还有事要忙  我得走了
I'm sure that I must be busy, I better go.

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}-你还好吗  -好好好  我很好
- You OK? - Yes, yes, yes, I'm OK.

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}事情终有尽头
Things end.

973
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:24,470

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}万事皆有尽头

976
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,190

But everything begins again too,

977
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:39,250
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}新生事物总会带来喜悦
and that's always happy.

978
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:43,120
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}要快乐

979
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,770
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}其他的我来处理就行

- Nardole. - Hey, Doctor?

00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:54,470
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}要说真话

Her name was River Song.

They were together for a while and they were very happy.

984
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:13,560
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}然后她去世了
And then she died,

985
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,380
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}很久以前的事了

- in a library. - Are you sure he's going to be all right?

987
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:20,590
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}他可是博士
He's the Doctor.

988
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:24,230
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}他很勇敢  也很傻
He's very brave and he's very silly

989
00:58:24,350 --> 00:58:28,030
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}我想他会难过一阵
and I think, for a time, he's going to be very sad.

990
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:31,190
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}但我保证  最终

{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}现在我们四处旅行

I will save all your lives and when I do,

00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:46,880
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}你会耗尽余生好奇我是谁
you will spend the rest of them wondering who I was.

1018
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:50,940
{\fnMicrosoft YaHei\fs20}你是疯了吗
Are you out of your mind?
