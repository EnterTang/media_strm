1
00:00:08,766 --> 00:00:10,638
我叫梅林达·戈登
My name is Melinda Gordon.

2
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:14,088
我结了婚  住在一个小镇上
I'm married, I live in a small town,

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,531
经营一家古董店
And I own an antique shop.

4
00:00:16,805 --> 00:00:18,477
我也许和你相似
I might be just like you.

5
00:00:18,928 --> 00:00:20,738
但当我还是小姑娘时
Except that from the time I was a little girl,

6
00:00:20,738 --> 00:00:22,440
我就能同亡者交流
I knew that I could talk to the dead.

7
00:00:22,908 --> 00:00:24,457
没事的  亲爱的
It's all right, honey.

8
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:26,662
祖母称他们为地缚灵
Earthbound spirits,my grandmother called them.

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,303
他们在人间滞留  因为他们有未了的心愿
They're stuck here because they have unfinished business with the living

10
00:00:30,303 --> 00:00:32,078
他们找我寻求帮助
And they come to me for help.

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,231
讲述我的故事  就是讲述他们的故事
In order to tell you my story, I have to tell you theirs.

12
00:00:41,611 --> 00:00:44,923
Three Days Grace - Pain
* Pain, without love *

13
00:00:44,923 --> 00:00:50,625
* Pain, can't get enough.  Pain, I like it rough *

14
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:56,220
* Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all *

15
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:02,750
* Pain, without love.  Pain, I can't get enough *

16
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,392
* Pain, I like it rough *

17
00:01:05,392 --> 00:01:08,355
* Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all *

18
00:01:08,355 --> 00:01:11,794
* rather feel pain than nothing at all *

19
00:01:11,794 --> 00:01:15,189
* rather feel pain *

20
00:01:21,187 --> 00:01:22,077
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

21
00:01:22,078 --> 00:01:23,603
我们是3天宽限乐队
We are Three Days Grace.

22
00:01:23,604 --> 00:01:25,420
马上回来
We'll be right back.

23
00:01:27,152 --> 00:01:28,705
你说带我出来跳舞
When you said that we were going out dancing,

24
00:01:28,706 --> 00:01:30,573
我没想到指的是这个
I didn't think this was what you meant.

25
00:01:30,574 --> 00:01:31,861
我说的是可能会有跳舞
I--I said there might be dancing.

26
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:32,979
你的原话是
Your exact words were,

27
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:35,142
我等不及把你领入舞池了
"I cannot wait to get you out on the dance floor."

28
00:01:35,143 --> 00:01:37,249
行了  蹦上蹦下也是跳舞啊
Come on. Jumping up and down can be dancing.

29
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,808
还需要酒吗
Another round, folks?

30
00:01:38,809 --> 00:01:40,836
行  两杯就好了
Yeah, yeah.  2 would be great.

31
00:01:40,836 --> 00:01:42,908
布兰登  乐队叫你
Brandon!  Order up for the band.

32
00:01:44,198 --> 00:01:46,528
抱歉  稍等片刻
Sorry, guys. Give me one sec.

33
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:49,933
你看这人眼熟吗
Does that guy look familiar to you?

34
00:01:49,934 --> 00:01:50,792
不熟
I don't think so.

35
00:01:50,793 --> 00:01:52,030
-你呢  -说不清
- You?  - I don't know.

36
00:01:52,031 --> 00:01:54,864
-酒来了 -布兰登  你不来一段吗
- Here you go, guys.  - Hey, Brandon. Aren't you playing?

37
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:55,865
唱得好
Good Job.

38
00:01:56,278 --> 00:01:57,560
别扫兴
Don't let us down.

39
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,448
-行了  来段吧  -不不不
- Come on, you gotta play.  - No, no, no.

40
00:01:59,449 --> 00:02:00,687
大家在为你欢呼  来段吧
Look the people hail for you. You gotta play.

41
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,651
给你把吉他
Here, I got a guitar right here.

42
00:02:09,076 --> 00:02:10,472
尽请欣赏
Hear it up, man.

43
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:26,097
太厉害了
He's amazing.

44
00:02:27,174 --> 00:02:28,429
等等
Oh, wait a minute.

45
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,506
我就说看着眼熟
That's why I know this guy.

46
00:02:29,507 --> 00:02:31,054
他以前是深红鸽子乐队的
He used to play for Crimson Doves.

47
00:02:31,055 --> 00:02:33,297
-谁  -深红鸽子  本地的乐队
- Who?  - Crimson doves. They were a local band,

48
00:02:33,731 --> 00:02:34,754
很受欢迎
Big favorite.

49
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:36,343
前几年  他们出过张很棒的专辑
They released this great album a few years back,

50
00:02:36,344 --> 00:02:38,354
随后就突然消失了
and then they just kinda disappeared.

51
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,232
你感觉到了吗
Do you feel that?

52
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:57,748
十
Ten.

53
00:03:00,584 --> 00:03:01,896
怎么了
What? What's going on?

54
00:03:23,793 --> 00:03:24,997
让我猜猜
Let me guess.

55
00:03:25,393 --> 00:03:27,358
吉米·亨德里克斯的鬼魂作祟[电吉他大师]
That wasn't the ghost of Jimi Hendrix?

56
00:03:27,548 --> 00:03:30,572
对怯场有新的解释了
But it gave new meaning to stage fright.

57
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,400
鬼语者  第二季  第9集
九的诅咒

58
00:04:04,928 --> 00:04:07,750
这么有才的人  怎么会在这工作
You know, why does a guy like that work here?

59
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,670
他应该上滚石封面
I mean, he should be on the cover of Rolling Stone,

60
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,907
而不是当酒保
not serving drinks.

61
00:04:10,907 --> 00:04:12,535
也许这儿的小费超多
Maybe he gets monster tips here.

62
00:04:12,535 --> 00:04:15,557
也许有鬼魂不想让他自己喜欢的事
Or maybe a ghost is trying to stop him from doing what he loves.

63
00:04:15,558 --> 00:04:16,490
我讨厌那样
I hate that.

64
00:04:16,491 --> 00:04:18,659
人死了  无法释然  这可以理解
You're dead, you can't move on, I get it.

65
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:20,562
但别去惹活人
But don't mess with the living,

66
00:04:20,562 --> 00:04:22,422
尤其是像他这样有天赋的人
especially when they're as talented as he is.

67
00:04:22,422 --> 00:04:23,611
我去把车开来
I'm gonna get the jeep.

68
00:04:24,003 --> 00:04:25,264
在这等我  小心着凉
You stay here, you stay warm.

69
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,294
到家后  再解决鬼的事吧
We'll get this ghost into therapy when we get home.

70
00:04:27,295 --> 00:04:28,461
好吧
All right.

71
00:04:28,465 --> 00:04:30,713
你好  你在台上很棒
Oh, hi! Hey, you were great up there.

72
00:04:30,714 --> 00:04:32,100
谢谢
Oh, thanks.

73
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:34,133
我没有把酒送过来  是吗
Aw, I never did get you those drinks, did I?

74
00:04:34,134 --> 00:04:35,675
我们也不想喝了
We cut ourselves off.

75
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:36,773
我叫梅林达
I'm Melinda.

76
00:04:36,774 --> 00:04:37,803
很高兴见到你
Nice to meet you.

77
00:04:37,804 --> 00:04:39,765
刚发生的事很奇怪  你还好吗
It was weird what happened. Were you ok?

78
00:04:39,766 --> 00:04:41,244
没事  只是反馈的问题
Yeah, it's just some feedback problems.

79
00:04:41,245 --> 00:04:42,522
以前也发生过
It's happened before.

80
00:04:42,523 --> 00:04:45,706
真的吗  以前在深红鸽子时也这样吗
Oh, really? Like when you used to play with, uh, Crimson Doves?

81
00:04:45,707 --> 00:04:46,647
你是歌迷吗
Are you a fan?

82
00:04:46,648 --> 00:04:47,816
我丈夫是
My husband was.

83
00:04:47,817 --> 00:04:49,046
他告诉你诅咒的事了吗
So he told you about the curse?

84
00:04:49,047 --> 00:04:50,686
没有  什么诅咒
No. What curse?

85
00:04:50,687 --> 00:04:51,770
无聊的市井传说而已
Just a bad urban legend.

86
00:04:51,771 --> 00:04:52,761
睡个好觉
Have a good night.

87
00:04:52,762 --> 00:04:54,967
你有时间能聊聊吗
Well, do you have a second to talk?

88
00:05:04,323 --> 00:05:07,878
行了吧  你真觉得这东西能卖三千块
Come on. You really think you can get $3,000 for this?

89
00:05:07,878 --> 00:05:09,952
当然了  据传这是大门乐队用过的
Easy. It's rumored that The Doors played on it.

90
00:05:09,953 --> 00:05:10,924
大门乐队是啥
What are The Doors?

91
00:05:12,673 --> 00:05:13,615
这东西怎么卖得掉
But how are you gonna sell it?

92
00:05:13,616 --> 00:05:16,000
都坏了  还得加几个新踏板
It's broken. It needs a new one of...those pedals.

93
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:17,444
我认识个翻新商
Well, I worked with a refurbisher,

94
00:05:17,445 --> 00:05:18,720
他名片还在我这儿
and his card's still on file.

95
00:05:18,721 --> 00:05:21,771
他还想买套公寓  如果有卖主的话
He's also looking to buy a condo if someone wants to sell him one.

96
00:05:21,772 --> 00:05:24,638
-我的宝啊  梅林达  -谢谢
- Serendipity, the name is Melinda.  - Thank you.

97
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,828
我先去看看我的日程
I will have to check my schedule,

98
00:05:25,828 --> 00:05:27,342
应该是有空的  对吧
but I think we're free, right?

99
00:05:27,343 --> 00:05:29,843
我还有一大堆作业要喂狗呢
I have a ton of homework that the dog needs to eat.

100
00:05:29,844 --> 00:05:30,703
好吧
Ok, fine.

101
00:05:30,704 --> 00:05:32,121
你到家后我要检查作业
But I want to see it when you get home.

102
00:05:32,122 --> 00:05:33,179
好吧
Ok.

103
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,904
再见  内德
Bye, Ned.

104
00:05:36,188 --> 00:05:39,493
过去一周真可谓”乐趣“多多啊
Yeah. That's a lot of fun to live with for the past week.

105
00:05:39,494 --> 00:05:41,282
怎么回事
What's going on?

106
00:05:41,968 --> 00:05:43,553
查理的生日快到了
Charlie's birthday is coming up.

107
00:05:43,554 --> 00:05:44,545
我知道  怪怪的
I know. Weird.

108
00:05:44,546 --> 00:05:45,507
他已经死了
He's dead.

109
00:05:45,508 --> 00:05:46,755
但
But...

110
00:05:46,756 --> 00:05:48,633
给他庆生是一个习惯
celebrating his birthday is just a little way

111
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:51,419
好让我们感受到他与我们同在
for us to keep his spirit with us.

112
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,523
合情合理
Actually, it makes perfect sense.

113
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:54,904
是啊
Yeah, well...

114
00:05:54,905 --> 00:05:56,018
内德不怎么喜欢
Ned's not so crazy about it.

115
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:56,970
他知道那天快到了
He knows it's coming up,

116
00:05:56,971 --> 00:05:58,746
于是就想方设法回避这事
and he's doing everything he can to avoid it,

117
00:05:58,747 --> 00:06:01,613
同时也就  回避了我
and by extension, avoid me.

118
00:06:01,685 --> 00:06:03,263
瞧  我找到了
Hey, look. I found it.

119
00:06:03,264 --> 00:06:06,346
我要去找新键踏板了
So I'm gonna be on the hunt for a new pedal.

120
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,542
-你好  -你好  帅哥
- Howdy.  - Hello, handsome.

121
00:06:08,824 --> 00:06:09,787
你好  迪莉娅
Hi, Delia.

122
00:06:12,177 --> 00:06:14,163
今天吉姆从工作中学到
Listen Jim learned at work today:

123
00:06:14,164 --> 00:06:16,265
不要被抓到在上班时间上网
Don't get caught surfing myspace at work.

124
00:06:16,266 --> 00:06:19,323
你在嘲笑我吗
Ooh, is there mocking?

125
00:06:19,438 --> 00:06:22,010
你要向13岁的小女孩靠齐了吗
Something along the lines of you being a 13-year-old girl?

126
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:22,966
很搞笑
Very funny.

127
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:25,169
这都是值得的
It was all worth it because...

128
00:06:25,615 --> 00:06:27,125
深红鸽子的网站
a link for the Crimson Doves.

129
00:06:28,705 --> 00:06:29,980
"安息吧  贾里德"
"Rest in peace, Jared".

130
00:06:29,981 --> 00:06:31,131
他是主唱
Yeah. He's the lead singer.

131
00:06:31,132 --> 00:06:33,108
看这里  他死于飞机失事
Get this...he dies in a plane crash

132
00:06:33,109 --> 00:06:35,781
正好在那张专辑出版两天前死的
2 days before that CD I was talking about comes out.

133
00:06:35,782 --> 00:06:36,728
但更奇怪的是
But it gets better.

134
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,783
这家伙  贝斯手  叫桑普森
This guy? He's the bass player. His name's Sampson.

135
00:06:38,784 --> 00:06:40,044
这不是艺名
That's not a stage name.

136
00:06:40,045 --> 00:06:42,133
他在接受采访时说
He gives an interview where he says that

137
00:06:42,134 --> 00:06:44,313
自从坠机后  乐队一直无法在一起演奏
the band has not been able to play together since the plane crash,

138
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:46,012
-因为  -他们被诅咒了
- because...  - They were cursed.

139
00:06:46,013 --> 00:06:47,166
说对了
Yup. Bingo.

140
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:49,366
也许布兰登说的就是这事
Maybe that's what Brandon was talking about.

141
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,880
但是这不是诅咒
Yeah, except it's not the curse.

142
00:06:50,881 --> 00:06:52,963
而是主唱的鬼魂作祟
It's the lead singer's ghost.

143
00:06:53,882 --> 00:06:55,075
贾里德
Jared.

144
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,275
这里有联系电话吗
Is there contact information in here?

145
00:06:57,276 --> 00:06:59,276
不是  幸运的是
No, but  it's a good thing

146
00:06:59,277 --> 00:07:02,821
我们这区叫桑普森的不多
there aren't too many guys with the first name Sampson in our zip code.

147
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,680
他在给电台做广告配乐
This guy writes commercial jingles for the radio.

148
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:05,710
你太强了
You rock.

149
00:07:05,711 --> 00:07:07,127
没错  是的
Yes, I do.

150
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,054
我要回去工作了
I gotta get back to work.

151
00:07:09,927 --> 00:07:11,035
好
All right...

152
00:07:11,793 --> 00:07:14,889
这是贾里德死后我们的第一次演奏
the first gig we did after Jared died should be on here somewhere.

153
00:07:17,876 --> 00:07:20,150
那是  那是贾里德吗
Is that...  is that Jared?

154
00:07:20,438 --> 00:07:21,489
是
Yeah.

155
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,210
他们之间有很怪异的心灵感应
They had that telepathy only those weird, creative types have.

156
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:29,515
他们从小就很铁  所以能有这份默契
Best friends since childhood, too, so that helped.

157
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,249
真是糊涂了
Where's my head?

158
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,062
不是这张碟
This is the wrong DVD.

159
00:07:39,211 --> 00:07:40,661
那是谁
who is that?

160
00:07:40,662 --> 00:07:42,439
杉迪  贾里德的女友
Oh. Sandy, Jared's girlfriend.

161
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,534
你们在做什么
What are you guys doing?

162
00:07:43,535 --> 00:07:46,281
布兰登写了首情歌  我们打算排练一下
Brandon has a love song we're trying to get off the ground.

163
00:07:47,285 --> 00:07:49,062
关于谁的  布兰登
Who's it about, Brandon?

164
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:53,207
你们准备好后再来找我吧
You know, let me know when you guys are ready to work.

165
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:56,168
看来布莱登不怎么喜欢她
I guess Brandon didn't like her very much.

166
00:07:56,169 --> 00:07:57,311
不是很喜欢
Not too much.

167
00:07:57,339 --> 00:07:59,353
他们都想得到贾里德的关注
They competed for Jared's attention.

168
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,672
这是丧礼之后一个月
This is a month after the funeral.

169
00:08:03,673 --> 00:08:07,360
贾里德走后  布莱登试着主唱  可是
With Jared gone, Brandon tried vocals. But...

170
00:08:12,498 --> 00:08:13,919
等等  按暂停
Wait, pause it.

171
00:08:18,134 --> 00:08:20,541
那看上去像10吗
Does that look like a "10" to you?

172
00:08:22,264 --> 00:08:23,604
我看不出
I don't see it.

173
00:08:25,196 --> 00:08:26,785
[洛克兰大学]

174
00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:28,766
我直说吧
Let me get this straight.

175
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:30,906
那个深红什么来着
The crimson  whatever they are,

176
00:08:30,907 --> 00:08:34,360
他们做不了音乐  却来怪罪诅咒
they can't play music, and now they're blaming it on a curse?

177
00:08:34,444 --> 00:08:35,756
鸽子
Doves. Yeah.

178
00:08:35,757 --> 00:08:37,320
总之  他们受到了阻碍
Anyway, something's been getting in their way,

179
00:08:37,321 --> 00:08:39,899
我认为  恰巧在主唱死了之后
and I think since the lead singer's ghost died

180
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,859
他们就再没能演奏
just about the same time as they stopped being able to play,

181
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,896
两者之间必有联系
It might be related.

182
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,465
说到流行乐的诅咒  我很惊奇
You know what fascinates me about pop culture curses?

183
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:48,928
歌迷对诅咒的妄想能给乐队带来极大影响
The delusional weight that the fans attribute to the curse.

184
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:51,411
你听过"保罗死了"的恶作剧吗
Have you heard of the "Paul is dead" hoax?

185
00:08:51,412 --> 00:08:53,544
略有耳闻  保罗·麦卡特尼吗[摇滚明星]
A little. Paul, as in Mccartney?

186
00:08:53,544 --> 00:08:54,758
对  简单地说
Yeah. Well, in a nutshell,

187
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:56,538
一群甲壳虫粉丝把音量开到最大
a bunch of beatlemaniacs turned the volume way up on

188
00:08:56,539 --> 00:08:58,317
听"永远的草莓地"
Strawberry Fields Forever,

189
00:08:58,318 --> 00:09:00,997
然后自以为听到了  "我埋葬了保罗"
and they think they hear "I buried Paul."

190
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,360
突然间谣言四起
Next thing you know, rumors pop up

191
00:09:02,361 --> 00:09:04,891
说可爱的小伙子出车祸死了
that the cute one went toes-up in a car crash.

192
00:09:04,892 --> 00:09:07,501
承认吧  你就是那个散播谣言的粉丝
All right, admit it. You were the beatlemaniac who started that rumor.

193
00:09:07,502 --> 00:09:09,954
亲爱的  要真是我就好了
Oh, sweetheart. If only. Are you kidding me?

194
00:09:09,955 --> 00:09:11,211
如果是我散播的
If I started that rumor?

195
00:09:11,212 --> 00:09:12,323
那将会是最精彩的谣言
That would have been the best.

196
00:09:12,324 --> 00:09:13,134
但不是我
But it wasn't me.

197
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,748
是约翰·列侬录音时搞的鬼[甲壳虫乐队成员]
It was John Lennon's studio trickery.

198
00:09:14,749 --> 00:09:17,129
他唱的是  "小红莓果酱"
He said, "cranberry sauce".

199
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,112
仅此而已
That was it.

200
00:09:19,113 --> 00:09:20,719
而你所说的物理表现
Now, you're talking about a physical manifestation,

201
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,285
他们是感觉到虚弱  发挥不佳吗
where people are actually getting ill, playing poorly?

202
00:09:23,286 --> 00:09:27,488
-没错  -对此  有个完美的解释
- Exactly.  - Well, there's a perfectly reasonable explanation for all of that.

203
00:09:27,489 --> 00:09:29,889
那叫做次声
It's--well, it's called infrasound.

204
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,313
那是什么
What's that?

205
00:09:31,314 --> 00:09:34,413
次声  是一种频率
Well, infrasound...  is a frequency...

206
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,189
有点像
That's not unlike...

207
00:09:39,715 --> 00:09:42,307
别弄了  像是用指甲刮黑板一样
Please don't do that. It sounds like nails on a chalkboard.

208
00:09:42,308 --> 00:09:44,037
用指甲刮黑板
Like nails on a chalkboard.

209
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:47,296
不同频率的声音  对不同的人有不同的影响
See, different frequencies affect different people in different ways.

210
00:09:47,297 --> 00:09:49,571
但是次声的频率极低
But infrasound is a frequency so low

211
00:09:49,572 --> 00:09:51,404
我们根本听不到
that we can't even hear it at all.

212
00:09:51,405 --> 00:09:53,036
但是人们可以感觉到
But human beings can feel it.

213
00:09:53,037 --> 00:09:54,494
感觉到骨头的震动  让我们不舒服
It rattles our bones, it makes us sick.

214
00:09:54,495 --> 00:09:55,669
迷信的说法是
Now, the wives' tale is that

215
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:57,852
鬼魂要让人们知道他的存在时
when ghosts want to make their presence felt,

216
00:09:57,853 --> 00:09:59,348
他们就用次声
they use that frequency.

217
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:00,740
那么
Ok, so...

218
00:10:00,741 --> 00:10:02,711
如果这说法是真的
say that the tale is true,

219
00:10:02,711 --> 00:10:04,679
主唱的鬼魂通过扩音器和扬声器
and that the lead singer's ghost pulled a frequency

220
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:06,198
发出了那种频率的声音
through the amp and speakers,

221
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:07,595
的确会让人不舒服  对吗
it could make someone sick, right?

222
00:10:07,596 --> 00:10:08,560
理论上是的
In theory.

223
00:10:08,561 --> 00:10:11,263
那理论上说  怎么才能抵消掉它
Ok, so theoretically, how do we counteract it?

224
00:10:11,264 --> 00:10:12,664
那就必须降低它的声强
Uh, well, you have to tune off of it.

225
00:10:12,665 --> 00:10:16,110
用电子乐器弹最低的G和弦
Go to the lowest "g" chord available on an electrical instrument.

226
00:10:16,111 --> 00:10:18,972
那会使声音的谐振归一化
Uh, that would naturalize the vibrative harmonies

227
00:10:18,973 --> 00:10:22,081
听起来就不那么反胃了
and make the music a little less...stomach-churning.

228
00:10:22,127 --> 00:10:24,274
那数字10又是什么意思呢
And what about the number 10?

229
00:10:24,354 --> 00:10:25,856
那个意义就很广泛了
That's a pretty broad topic.

230
00:10:25,857 --> 00:10:28,330
和这有什么关联  这数字一直出现
Does it have any relevance? It keeps popping up.

231
00:10:28,515 --> 00:10:30,434
如果和你说的诅咒有关  我不清楚
If it has something to do with your curse, I don't know.

232
00:10:30,434 --> 00:10:31,487
我得去查查
I'll look into it.

233
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:33,876
喂
Hello?

234
00:10:33,877 --> 00:10:34,954
你好  迪莉娅
Hi, Delia.

235
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:38,140
修钢琴要多少钱
How much to fix the piano?

236
00:10:39,853 --> 00:10:41,206
这样吧  那帮我个忙
Ok, you know what? Do me a favor

237
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:44,237
问问只买部件要多少钱
and just find out how much it is for just the parts.

238
00:10:44,238 --> 00:10:47,836
我认识个朋友会修  能打折
I think I know somebody who can fix the piano for us at a discount.

239
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:51,234
你怎么知道我懂钢琴
So how'd you find out I knew about pianos?

240
00:10:51,588 --> 00:10:53,617
我听说你有受过古典乐训练
I heard that you were classically trained,

241
00:10:53,617 --> 00:10:55,011
我就瞎猜你会
and I took a wild guess.

242
00:10:55,183 --> 00:10:57,008
你调查过我了吗
Have you been checking up on me?

243
00:10:57,009 --> 00:10:57,844
一点点
A little.

244
00:10:57,845 --> 00:10:59,937
那天你提到诅咒  我有些好奇
When you mentioned a curse,I got curious.

245
00:11:00,456 --> 00:11:01,946
我认为你的问题不在于此
I don't think that's your problem.

246
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:05,293
你总是刚见面就问私人问题吗
Do you always ask personal questions of people you just met?

247
00:11:05,294 --> 00:11:07,011
实际上  是的
Actually, yes.

248
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:08,475
你为什么在夜总会工作
Why do you work in a club?

249
00:11:08,476 --> 00:11:09,993
我需要工作
Because I need a job.

250
00:11:10,646 --> 00:11:13,350
如果你想让我声泪俱下地承认
And before you try to get a tearful confession out of me

251
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,838
我做梦都想回归舞台
about how much I wish I could be up there,

252
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:16,839
你还是别多此一举了
let me just save you the trouble.

253
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,337
我每天醒来都想回舞台
I wake up every morning wanting that.

254
00:11:19,338 --> 00:11:20,600
但我做不到
But I can't.

255
00:11:21,705 --> 00:11:23,653
我无能为力了
And there's nothing I can do about it.

256
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:26,176
布兰登  我
Brandon, I--

257
00:11:27,077 --> 00:11:29,763
说到天赋  我略懂一些
I know a little about having a gift

258
00:11:29,764 --> 00:11:31,881
也理解你会为之苦恼
and being frustrated by it.

259
00:11:32,402 --> 00:11:33,713
我能帮助你
I think I can help you.

260
00:11:33,714 --> 00:11:34,821
你都不认识我
You don't even know me.

261
00:11:34,822 --> 00:11:38,294
是的  但我只要求你弹一曲
You're right. But all I'm asking you to do is play one song.

262
00:11:38,451 --> 00:11:41,550
如果钢琴出什么问题  我可不负责
If anything happens to this piano, I'm not responsible.

263
00:11:41,722 --> 00:11:43,192
同意
Agreed.

264
00:12:00,728 --> 00:12:02,181
继续弹
Keep playing.

265
00:12:02,713 --> 00:12:05,060
一会儿我让你按低音G  你就按  好吗
But when I tell you, hit the low "g", ok?

266
00:12:05,061 --> 00:12:05,948
为什么
Why?

267
00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:07,562
相信我
Just trust me.

268
00:12:15,837 --> 00:12:16,651
让他弹那个
Make him play it.

269
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:17,787
弹什么
Play what?

270
00:12:17,788 --> 00:12:20,242
-什么  -弹"第十"
- What?  - Play the tenth.

271
00:12:38,745 --> 00:12:40,690
我问一句无关的话
I know that this is gonna sound random,

272
00:12:40,691 --> 00:12:42,845
你之前弹过"第十"吗
but have you ever played the tenth?

273
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:45,919
不知道这是什么吗
You don't know what that is.

274
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,355
不知道
Nope.

275
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:50,080
你的音乐老师呢
What about music teachers?

276
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,965
他们之中有谁让你弹过"第十"吗
Did any of them ever ask you to play the tenth?

277
00:12:53,488 --> 00:12:55,870
我一生只有一个音乐老师
I had one music teacher my whole life.

278
00:12:55,871 --> 00:12:57,658
非常有才能的一个人
Quite accomplished, actually.

279
00:12:57,659 --> 00:12:59,522
他为纽约爱乐乐团演奏过钢琴
He played piano for the New York Philharmonic.

280
00:12:59,523 --> 00:13:01,738
还给他们写过几首交响曲
Wrote some symphonies for them, too.

281
00:13:01,932 --> 00:13:04,267
但他已经埋在我妈边上了
And he's buried right next to my mom.

282
00:13:04,456 --> 00:13:05,599
他是你父亲
It's your dad.

283
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,925
是的
Yeah.

284
00:13:07,527 --> 00:13:09,532
没听说过什么"第十"
And the tenth never came up.

285
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,874
[洛克兰大学  音乐图书馆]

286
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,026
-给你  -谢谢
- Here you are.  - Thank you.

287
00:13:33,424 --> 00:13:35,201
作曲  帕特里克·罗特

288
00:13:40,626 --> 00:13:41,671
打扰一下
Excuse me.

289
00:13:41,672 --> 00:13:42,861
问个傻问题
Crazy question.

290
00:13:42,862 --> 00:13:45,914
这里有帕特里克·罗特的九首交响曲
You have Patrick Roth's other 9 symphonies here.

291
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,441
你知道有第十首吗
Do you know anything about a tenth?

292
00:13:47,442 --> 00:13:49,087
让我查查
Uh, let me check.

293
00:13:50,888 --> 00:13:54,574
上面说  在完成之前他就去世了
Oh, it says here he passed away before he could complete it.

294
00:13:54,575 --> 00:13:57,155
不过  档案里保存有前三个乐章
Although, we do have his first 3 movements on file.

295
00:13:57,156 --> 00:13:59,052
明白了  我能复印一份吗
I see. Could I get a copy of that score?

296
00:13:59,053 --> 00:14:01,783
当然  我们还有他排练时的录音
Sure. We also have recordings of his symphony rehearsals.

297
00:14:01,784 --> 00:14:03,058
我能听一下吗
Can I hear them?

298
00:14:24,796 --> 00:14:26,629
他一定要弹
He must play it!

299
00:14:27,303 --> 00:14:29,106
这就是你的目的
Is that what you want?

300
00:14:29,172 --> 00:14:30,559
你要布兰登弹这首曲子吗
Brandon to play this?

301
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:31,916
不
No!

302
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:33,930
你没明白
You're not getting it!

303
00:14:45,082 --> 00:14:46,862
古典乐
Classical music.

304
00:14:46,863 --> 00:14:48,145
是的  我刚想明白
Yeah. I just found out myself.

305
00:14:48,146 --> 00:14:50,223
虽然线索围绕着"十"
I know that it revolves around the tenth.

306
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:52,635
可我觉得更像是"弹奏第十交响曲"
Um, but it's more like play the tenth symphony,

307
00:14:52,636 --> 00:14:54,510
可我找到的这首交响曲还没完成
and the one that I found wasn't even finished.

308
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:57,004
不不  我能搞定这个  
No, no.  I can make this work. This I can make work.

309
00:14:57,004 --> 00:14:58,930
我倒是希望能早点得到消息
Sure, I would have loved having this information

310
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:01,216
我刚答应摇滚名人堂里的某位熟女
before I promised sexual favors to a very unappealing woman

311
00:15:01,216 --> 00:15:02,545
给她提供性服务
at the rock and roll hall of fame,

312
00:15:02,546 --> 00:15:05,567
也许你的问题就是你的答案
but maybe your problem is actually your solution.

313
00:15:05,568 --> 00:15:06,770
九的诅咒吗
The curse of the ninth?

314
00:15:06,771 --> 00:15:08,066
所有伟大的作曲家
All the great composers died after

315
00:15:08,066 --> 00:15:10,163
都在完成第九交响曲后逝世
completing their ninth symphony.

316
00:15:10,164 --> 00:15:12,304
包括贝多芬  马勒  布鲁克纳
you're talking Beethoven, Mahler, Bruckner.

317
00:15:12,304 --> 00:15:14,937
都是第十交响曲写到一半时死的
They all croaked halfway through their tenth.

318
00:15:14,938 --> 00:15:15,961
这诅咒是真的吗
Is this curse real?

319
00:15:15,962 --> 00:15:17,922
不是  跟诅咒完全扯不上
No. No, no. It's not a real curse at all.

320
00:15:17,923 --> 00:15:20,588
他们都死于性病导致的脑中风
These guys all died from having their brains rotted from venereal disease,

321
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:24,215
说是诅咒是为了让他们听上去更伟大
but saying it's a curse makes it sound more respectable.

322
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:26,722
鬼魂会不会回来完成自己的作品
And what about a ghost coming back to finish his work?

323
00:15:26,722 --> 00:15:28,206
有这样的记载吗
Is there anything in here about that?

324
00:15:28,207 --> 00:15:31,407
有谣传说巴赫因为受贝多芬的鬼魂纠缠
Well, it's rumored that Brahms was so haunted by Beethoven's ghost

325
00:15:31,408 --> 00:15:33,443
他二十年没写出一个字来
he couldn't write a word for 20 years.

326
00:15:33,444 --> 00:15:35,222
太有建设性了  谢谢
That is brilliant. Thank you.

327
00:15:35,223 --> 00:15:36,298
等等
Wait. Wait.

328
00:15:36,406 --> 00:15:39,480
你冲出去在墙上留下个人形大洞之前
Hey, before you leave a Melinda-shaped hole in that wall,

329
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:41,731
你说你的征兆里有鸽子
you said there were doves in your symbolism?

330
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,668
深红鸽子  那个乐队的名字
Crimson Doves.That was the name of the band.

331
00:15:43,669 --> 00:15:44,918
听这个
Listen to this.

332
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:46,874
鸽子之死
"The death of a dove,

333
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:49,351
从征兆学来说  暗示着厄运
symbolically speaking, indicates misfortune.

334
00:15:49,351 --> 00:15:51,468
如果鸽子死在某人家附近
And the death of a dove near someone's house

335
00:15:51,468 --> 00:15:54,136
意味着那屋里的某人即将死去
means the impending death of someone in that house."

336
00:15:54,137 --> 00:15:55,894
也许这主唱之死
Maybe this lead singer's death,

337
00:15:55,895 --> 00:15:58,411
不只是巧合
isn't just a coincidence.

338
00:15:58,738 --> 00:16:01,440
也许吧
Yeah. Maybe.

339
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,525
我能看见亡者
I can see the dead,

340
00:16:03,526 --> 00:16:05,739
你父亲的鬼魂正缠着你
and your father's ghost is attached to you.

341
00:16:05,997 --> 00:16:07,704
你是不是想说
So is this the part where you say,

342
00:16:07,705 --> 00:16:09,380
我看到名字里有P
"I'm getting a "p" name."

343
00:16:09,381 --> 00:16:10,447
我回答  帕特里克
And I say, "Patrick."

344
00:16:10,448 --> 00:16:13,571
你就说  他要你不用担心钱
And you say,"he wants you to stop worrying about money."

345
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:14,303
我就回答
And I say--

346
00:16:14,304 --> 00:16:16,340
你父亲比你矮3英寸
your father is 3 inches shorter than you.

347
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:17,541
他的发际线后移
His hairline is receding.

348
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:20,190
说话带有欧洲口音  也许是德国口音
He has a soft European accent. German, I think.

349
00:16:20,191 --> 00:16:21,294
他看上去很急躁
Seems like an impatient guy,

350
00:16:21,295 --> 00:16:22,239
最后一次看见他时
and the last time I was with him,

351
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:23,986
他一直冲我喊  说我没明白
he kept telling me how I wasn't getting it.

352
00:16:23,987 --> 00:16:25,849
够了吗
How am I doing?

353
00:16:26,771 --> 00:16:28,806
他以前经常对我这么说
He used to say that to me all the time.

354
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,530
那时我常练琴
When I would practice.

355
00:16:32,531 --> 00:16:34,221
一天四小时
4 hours a day.

356
00:16:34,711 --> 00:16:35,948
每天如此
Every day

357
00:16:36,707 --> 00:16:38,727
他让我弹奏他的交响曲
He made me play his symphonies.

358
00:16:39,802 --> 00:16:42,369
你没明白  布兰登
You're not getting it, Brandon.

359
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,709
你拍子没跟上
You're off the beat.

360
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,694
你受管弦乐的影响了
Your orchestra is lapping you.

361
00:16:45,695 --> 00:16:47,003
不要看下面
Don't look down.

362
00:16:47,003 --> 00:16:48,384
答案不在你手上
The answer isn't in your hands,

363
00:16:48,385 --> 00:16:49,403
在这里
it's here.

364
00:16:49,654 --> 00:16:52,990
一定要弹对  否则就别弹了
Play it right.  Or don't play at all.

365
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,903
鬼魂的滞留是因为他们有未了的心愿
Ghosts stay behind because they have unfinished business with the living.

366
00:16:57,904 --> 00:17:00,473
我认为你父亲阻止你演奏
I think your father trying to ruin your music...

367
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,192
是因为他要你完成这个
is because he wants you to finish this.

368
00:17:06,071 --> 00:17:08,440
你明白你在要求我做什么吗
Do you have any idea what you're asking me to do here?

369
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:10,162
这人让我的人生如此痛苦
The man made my life miserable.

370
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,268
你却要我揣摩他的想法
And now you want me to get inside of his head?

371
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:14,128
我理解你  但如果你能完成交响曲
Look, I understand. But if you complete the symphony,

372
00:17:14,129 --> 00:17:15,834
我就能让他超度
I can cross him over.

373
00:17:16,381 --> 00:17:17,399
那是什么意思
Wh--what does that mean?

374
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,768
意味着  你又能演奏音乐了
It means you can play music again.

375
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:21,614
你的音乐
Your music.

376
00:17:29,373 --> 00:17:31,261
你看到计算器了吗
Hey, have you seen the calculator?

377
00:17:33,651 --> 00:17:34,838
你想过吗
Have you thought about

378
00:17:34,838 --> 00:17:37,131
明天打算怎么给你爸过生日
what you want to do for your dad's birthday tomorrow?

379
00:17:37,492 --> 00:17:38,766
什么也不做
How about nothing?

380
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:40,571
内德  看着我
Ned, look at me.

381
00:17:40,814 --> 00:17:41,817
这很重要
This is important.

382
00:17:41,818 --> 00:17:43,207
我真的想做些什么
I really want to do it.

383
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,063
随便什么  都好吧
Whatever. That's fine.

384
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,582
那架电子钢琴卖得很火啊
That electric piano is the hit of the town.

385
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:51,955
已经三个人出价想买了
I've already had 3 bids on it.

386
00:17:51,956 --> 00:17:53,947
那应该谢谢他修好了琴
Uh, well, you have him to thank for fixing it.

387
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:54,808
布兰登  这是迪莉娅
Brandon, Delia.

388
00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:56,422
迪莉娅  这是布兰登
Delia, Brandon.

389
00:17:58,865 --> 00:18:00,019
他很有艺术家脾气
He's very artistic.

390
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,810
只要能为店里带来生意
As long as he brings traffic through the store,

391
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,861
随便他怎么耍个性
he can be as artistic as he wants.

392
00:18:03,862 --> 00:18:04,863
跟上
Come on.

393
00:18:06,014 --> 00:18:08,028
你好  内德
Hi, Ned.

394
00:18:13,245 --> 00:18:15,533
我对父亲的作曲风格很了解
I have a pretty good sense of my dad's composing style,

395
00:18:15,534 --> 00:18:17,092
不过我还得从头弹一遍
but I'm gonna have to play it through once

396
00:18:17,093 --> 00:18:19,535
感受一下他想要表达什么
just to get a feel for what he was trying to say.

397
00:18:19,536 --> 00:18:21,130
我能帮上什么忙吗
Is there anything I can help you with?

398
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:24,017
有  你有没有录音机
Yeah. Uh,  Do you have a tape recorder?

399
00:18:26,033 --> 00:18:28,983
明晚的安排  你还没给我答复
You never answered my question about tomorrow night.

400
00:18:31,602 --> 00:18:34,490
记得你和你爸都喜欢焦糖布丁吗
Do you remember the creme brulee that you and dad always liked?

401
00:18:34,491 --> 00:18:35,995
也许我能做出来
Maybe I could make that.

402
00:18:35,996 --> 00:18:37,884
或许我们什么也不该做
Or maybe we shouldn't do anything.

403
00:18:37,885 --> 00:18:39,077
为什么
How come?

404
00:18:39,512 --> 00:18:42,233
因为已经过了三年了
Because it's been 3 years.

405
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,233
因为
Because it

406
00:18:44,234 --> 00:18:45,358
内德
Ned.

407
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,596
我们得谈谈这事
I want to talk about this.

408
00:18:49,949 --> 00:18:52,089
我有一篇"杀死嘲鸟"的报告
I have a report due on to kill a mockingbird.

409
00:18:52,103 --> 00:18:53,978
落在里屋了
I, um--left it in the back room.

410
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:55,387
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

411
00:18:58,161 --> 00:18:59,107
这个行吗
How's this?

412
00:18:59,108 --> 00:19:00,776
很好
Oh, it's perfect.

413
00:19:03,321 --> 00:19:04,781
你能做得到
You can do this.

414
00:19:05,557 --> 00:19:07,102
上次我漏弹了一个音
Last time I missed a note,

415
00:19:07,103 --> 00:19:08,900
差点被他打到吐血
my dad almost drew blood.

416
00:19:09,573 --> 00:19:11,575
现在他变成了鬼
Now that he's a ghost,

417
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,500
谁知道他会做什么
who knows what he'll do?

418
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:16,179
有时  鬼魂有话要传递给生者
Sometimes, ghosts have messages for the living.

419
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,262
我需要你的帮助才能理解
I might need your help to understand it.

420
00:19:18,263 --> 00:19:19,928
一个字  一句话
A word, a phrase.

421
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:22,549
只有你们才能理解的话
Something that might have meaning for the two of you.

422
00:19:40,224 --> 00:19:42,033
布兰登  你父亲来了
Brandon, your dad's here.

423
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:44,477
我没有弹低音G
I didn't hit the low "g".

424
00:19:44,528 --> 00:19:45,898
没关系
No, it's ok.

425
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:49,099
没关系  他也许只想看着你弹
It's ok. He probably just needed to see you play.

426
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:54,746
怎么回事
What is that?

427
00:20:02,107 --> 00:20:03,696
现在应该没事了
I think we're ok.

428
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,243
帮我
Help me.

429
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,244
按低音G
Hit the low "g".

430
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:19,498
贾里德
Jared.

431
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,275
等等
Wait, wait, wait.

432
00:20:26,276 --> 00:20:27,928
你是不是想说
Are you trying to tell me that...

433
00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:29,560
我父亲已经走了
my dad is gone,

434
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,499
还有另一个鬼魂在这吗
and there's another ghost?

435
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,747
是  缠着他的是贾里德
Yeah, attached to him. Uh, it's Jared.

436
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,250
他现在在店里
He's in the store.

437
00:20:35,439 --> 00:20:36,622
兄弟  最近如何
How's it going, buddy?

438
00:20:36,623 --> 00:20:38,257
他在跟你打招呼
He says hi.

439
00:20:39,437 --> 00:20:40,798
那真是
That's

440
00:20:41,294 --> 00:20:44,176
天  那真是太好了
my god, that's awesome.

441
00:20:44,332 --> 00:20:46,341
你为什么会来这
Yeah. Why are you here?

442
00:20:46,342 --> 00:20:47,710
来保护布兰登
To protect Brandon.

443
00:20:47,711 --> 00:20:48,750
他在保护你
He's protecting you.

444
00:20:48,751 --> 00:20:52,231
-保护他什么  -以免他浪费时间
- From who?  - From that waste of time.

445
00:20:52,232 --> 00:20:54,145
浪费时间  你在说什么
Waste of time? What are you talking about?

446
00:20:54,146 --> 00:20:55,184
我知道
I know.

447
00:20:58,167 --> 00:21:00,977
那时  我们一起玩音乐一年了
We'd been playing together for about a year.

448
00:21:12,259 --> 00:21:14,025
你们觉得如何
What did you guys think?

449
00:21:14,026 --> 00:21:17,393
-我觉得不行  -很好听
- I really don't think it works.  - It was beautiful.

450
00:21:17,525 --> 00:21:19,713
你有填词吗
Do you have lyrics?

451
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:23,071
我还在写
I'm still working on them.

452
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:26,741
你们想要吃的或喝的吗
And you guys want something to eat, or drink, or--?

453
00:21:26,908 --> 00:21:28,149
父亲
Dad.

454
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:40,109
你们两个  出去
You two, leave.

455
00:21:40,855 --> 00:21:42,201
马上
Right now.

456
00:21:58,077 --> 00:22:02,542
你就为了这个  放弃了多年的训练
So this is what you decide to throw your training away for?

457
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:06,459
这比莫扎特还好吗
This is better than Mozart?

458
00:22:07,067 --> 00:22:09,583
莫扎特在他的时代酷毙了
Mozart rocked out in his day.

459
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,650
这是你告诉我的
You taught me that.

460
00:22:11,651 --> 00:22:12,830
你要浪费你的时间
You want to waste your time,

461
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,599
我不能阻止你
I can't stop you.

462
00:22:15,097 --> 00:22:18,753
但是我不能原谅你浪费我的时间
But what I can't forgive you for is wasting mine.

463
00:22:21,247 --> 00:22:22,431
从那之后
After that,

464
00:22:22,432 --> 00:22:25,223
我跟我父亲开始冷战  任何事
my dad and I stopped. Everything.

465
00:22:25,224 --> 00:22:28,596
不说话  不住在一起
Talking, being in the same room.

466
00:22:29,677 --> 00:22:31,305
贾里德成为了我的家人
Jared became my family.

467
00:22:32,181 --> 00:22:33,983
我想他现在还是
I guess he still is.

468
00:22:34,449 --> 00:22:37,382
布兰登的父亲出现  你做了什么
So, Brandon's dad shows up and you what?

469
00:22:37,383 --> 00:22:39,952
打跑他  然后毁掉我的店吗
Beat him up, and then decide to wreck my store?

470
00:22:39,952 --> 00:22:41,980
我在死后不能弹琴已经很惨
It was bad enough that I died and couldn't play anymore.

471
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,962
可后来  我跟随布兰登看他的演奏
But then I followed Brandon to his next gig

472
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:46,213
看到那混蛋在扰乱音律
and saw that douche mucking around with the sound.

473
00:22:46,215 --> 00:22:48,508
让布兰登弹得乱七八糟
Disrupted, made Brandon play like crap.

474
00:22:48,509 --> 00:22:50,442
他在说什么
Wh--what--what's he saying?

475
00:22:50,443 --> 00:22:52,520
他说是你父亲在影响你演奏
He says your dad was affecting your playing,

476
00:22:52,521 --> 00:22:53,452
我们感到的震动
and the rumble we felt?

477
00:22:53,453 --> 00:22:55,307
就是他赶走你父亲的方式
That was his way of fighting him off.

478
00:22:55,308 --> 00:22:56,522
意图是好的
Good intentions aside,

479
00:22:56,523 --> 00:22:58,044
但这没有解决问题
this is not solving the problem.

480
00:22:58,142 --> 00:22:59,956
你父亲希望你完成交响乐
Your dad wants you to finish the symphony,

481
00:22:59,957 --> 00:23:01,894
在那之前他是不会超度的
and he's not gonna cross over until he does that.

482
00:23:01,895 --> 00:23:03,003
也许还有第三选项
Well, maybe there's a third option.

483
00:23:03,004 --> 00:23:07,040
也许伟大的父亲需要认可自己的儿子
Maybe mr. Father of the year needs to accept who his son is.

484
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:08,590
只要他离开布兰登
Once he leaves Brandon alone,

485
00:23:08,591 --> 00:23:10,328
我就离开他
I'll leave him alone.

486
00:23:15,137 --> 00:23:16,301
喂
Hello.

487
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:18,957
梅  是我
Hey, Mel. It's me.

488
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:20,289
一切还好吗
Is everything ok?

489
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,633
实际上  我有点害怕
No, actually. I'm a little freaked out.

490
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:24,512
内德从上车开始
You know, Ned was very jumpy

491
00:23:24,513 --> 00:23:26,123
就一直很兴奋
 the whole car ride home and all through dinner.

492
00:23:26,124 --> 00:23:29,504
他说他有件事情必须要做
And then he told me that he had to go do something and...

493
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,793
我找不到他
I can't find him.

494
00:23:30,837 --> 00:23:32,864
你要我和吉姆帮你找他吗
Would you want jim and I to help you look for him?

495
00:23:32,865 --> 00:23:36,054
我觉得应该放他一小时  再...
I feel like I should give it an hour or so before...

496
00:23:36,651 --> 00:23:38,421
我真的不知所措了
I really lose my mind. Ok?

497
00:23:38,422 --> 00:23:39,517
如果你看到
So but if you see him

498
00:23:39,517 --> 00:23:41,947
看到他去了店里或广场上
if you see him at the store or in the square,

499
00:23:41,948 --> 00:23:44,111
给我个电话  好吗
will you call me, please?

500
00:23:44,112 --> 00:23:45,149
带他回家好吗
Will you bring him home?

501
00:23:46,087 --> 00:23:47,313
非常感谢
Thank you so much.

502
00:23:47,314 --> 00:23:48,997
内德的短信  "你能看见鬼魂"

503
00:23:52,362 --> 00:23:53,628
内德
Ned.

504
00:23:54,493 --> 00:23:55,660
我说错了吗
Am I wrong?

505
00:23:55,661 --> 00:23:57,135
我要你仔细听着
I want you to listen to me very closely.

506
00:23:57,136 --> 00:23:58,404
我们不能告诉你妈妈
We cannot tell your mom.

507
00:23:58,405 --> 00:24:00,325
-为什么  -原因很复杂
- Why not?  - It's complicated.

508
00:24:00,326 --> 00:24:02,672
你能帮助那个玩吉他的人
So, you can help this guitarist guy,

509
00:24:02,673 --> 00:24:03,907
却不帮我
but you can't help me?

510
00:24:03,908 --> 00:24:05,358
帮你什么  内德
With what, Ned?

511
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:07,339
我可以帮助你什么
What can I possibly help you with?

512
00:24:07,663 --> 00:24:09,644
我要你找到我父亲
I need you to find my dad.

513
00:24:10,054 --> 00:24:11,664
在他死后
After he died

514
00:24:11,665 --> 00:24:14,050
那时我还很小
when I was young...er--

515
00:24:14,432 --> 00:24:15,997
我认为我看到他了
I thought I saw him.

516
00:24:15,998 --> 00:24:18,069
我妈说那是我想象出来
My mom just told me I imagined it.

517
00:24:19,037 --> 00:24:21,367
但我没有  是吗
But I wasn't, was I?

518
00:24:21,368 --> 00:24:23,776
不  你没有
No. No, you weren't.

519
00:24:23,975 --> 00:24:26,279
那你还能看见我父亲
So, you can still see my dad?

520
00:24:26,746 --> 00:24:29,084
不  不是这样子的
No. It doesn't really work that way.

521
00:24:29,085 --> 00:24:30,444
为什么不行
Why not?

522
00:24:31,031 --> 00:24:33,973
因为我不能控制哪个鬼会来见我
Because I have no control over which ghosts appear to me.

523
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:35,720
你帮助过那人的父亲
You helped that other guy's dad!

524
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:40,044
我听到你说鬼魂给你提示和信息
And I heard you saying that ghosts give you signs and messages.

525
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:42,570
那正是我妈妈所需要的
That's just what my mom needs.

526
00:24:42,571 --> 00:24:44,289
一条信息而已
A message.

527
00:24:44,745 --> 00:24:47,159
我妈一直都很伤心
Cause my mom is hurting.

528
00:24:51,878 --> 00:24:53,436
内德  你去哪里
Ned, where you going?

529
00:24:53,685 --> 00:24:54,696
回家
Home.

530
00:24:54,697 --> 00:24:56,789
别担心  我没事的
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

531
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,892
感谢你的帮助
Thanks for your help.

532
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:09,413
要吃点什么
Want anything to eat?

533
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:13,740
你看不见查理  对吧
You don't see Charlie anywhere, do you?

534
00:25:14,315 --> 00:25:15,591
看不见
No.

535
00:25:16,656 --> 00:25:17,769
最糟的是
And the worst part is that

536
00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:19,697
我希望能告诉迪莉娅和内德他没离开
I wish I could tell delia and Ned that he's here.

537
00:25:19,698 --> 00:25:21,377
但他不在这
But he's not.

538
00:25:22,261 --> 00:25:25,363
我有没有说过  我很庆幸
Have I ever told you how happy I am I'm--

539
00:25:26,076 --> 00:25:27,503
我不是你
I'm not you.

540
00:25:27,872 --> 00:25:29,186
这算什么安慰
Well, that's not helping.

541
00:25:29,187 --> 00:25:30,696
不是因为你所做的事情
It's not the way of what you do,

542
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:32,383
而是那份责任
it's the responsibility.

543
00:25:32,384 --> 00:25:33,604
以及你的处世方法
I mean, how you have to do it.

544
00:25:33,604 --> 00:25:35,358
比如  一方面
For example, on one hand

545
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:38,607
你需要说服布兰登不再隐藏他的天赋
you have to convince Brandon not hide his gift.

546
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:41,843
但另一方面
But then on the other hand...

547
00:25:42,464 --> 00:25:45,886
却对内德和迪莉娅隐藏了自己的天赋
you've been doing exactly that yourself with Ned and Delia.

548
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:47,550
你认为我应该告诉她
So, you think I should tell her.

549
00:25:47,551 --> 00:25:48,538
不  不是
No. No.

550
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:50,485
你应该在时机成熟时向迪莉娅坦白
You should come clean with Delia when you feel its right.

551
00:25:50,486 --> 00:25:52,425
而不要等到被内德逼到墙角
And not because Ned's got you boxed into a corner.

552
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:53,684
不过
But...

553
00:25:54,415 --> 00:25:58,479
我觉得你应该让我跟内德谈谈
what I do think is that you should let me talk to Ned.

554
00:25:58,692 --> 00:26:00,873
你手上的事太多了
You got too much on your plate already.

555
00:26:04,093 --> 00:26:05,644
谢谢你
Thank you.

556
00:26:07,706 --> 00:26:09,820
这是丈夫的职责
It's what I'm here for.

557
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,631
你没有理解琴弦的部分
You're not getting the string section.

558
00:26:18,632 --> 00:26:20,040
你弹得太甜美
You're too sweet.

559
00:26:20,041 --> 00:26:21,835
音符很甜美
The notes are sweet.

560
00:26:21,835 --> 00:26:25,322
你不需要弹得这么甜美
You don't have to play it so sweetly.

561
00:26:26,577 --> 00:26:29,679
你没有理解  没有明白
You are not getting it. You are not getting it.

562
00:26:32,771 --> 00:26:35,436
-帕特里克  -你要帮助布兰登完成第十曲
- Patrick.  - You have to help Brandon with the tenth.

563
00:26:35,437 --> 00:26:37,547
我已经尽力了
I've done everything that I can.

564
00:26:37,548 --> 00:26:40,527
你还在这里的原因是  自私
The reason that you're still here is because of your selfishness.

565
00:26:40,528 --> 00:26:42,436
布兰登不会完成你的交响乐
Brandon is not going to complete your symphony.

566
00:26:42,437 --> 00:26:43,837
不是我的第十交响乐
It's not my tenth.

567
00:26:43,838 --> 00:26:45,566
是我儿子的
My son's.

568
00:27:03,727 --> 00:27:06,720
你们有没有在这碟里录过第十首歌
Did you guys ever record a tenth track for the CD?

569
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:09,153
那只是他胡乱弹奏的
It was just something he was messing with.

570
00:27:09,154 --> 00:27:10,751
他和贾里德决定曲目排序时
When he and Jared were figuring out the track order,

571
00:27:10,752 --> 00:27:11,895
并没有收录那首歌
it didn't make the cut.

572
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,074
我不知道最后怎么了
I don't know what happened to it.

573
00:27:13,075 --> 00:27:14,590
但杉迪知道
But Sandy would.

574
00:27:14,993 --> 00:27:17,146
她一直都跟贾里德在一起
She was with Jared the whole time.

575
00:27:17,147 --> 00:27:19,126
车祸后  她经历了太多
She went through enough after the crash.

576
00:27:19,127 --> 00:27:20,344
我不希望把她扯进来
I don't want to drag her back into this.

577
00:27:20,345 --> 00:27:23,300
如果不重要  我是不会提出来的
I wouldn't bring it up unless it was really important.

578
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,520
如果布兰登能弹奏这首歌
If Brandon can get through this song,

579
00:27:25,521 --> 00:27:27,809
也许能帮助他重新弹琴
maybe it'll help him play again.

580
00:27:40,666 --> 00:27:43,034
杉迪  我是梅林达
Sandy, hi, I'm Melinda.

581
00:27:43,093 --> 00:27:44,751
有什么需要我帮忙的
Hi. Can I help you?

582
00:27:44,752 --> 00:27:48,155
实际上  我希望能和你谈谈深红鸽子
Actually I was hoping that we could talk about the Crimson Doves.

583
00:27:48,476 --> 00:27:51,319
我很久没联系他们了
Man, I haven't thought about those guys in a while.

584
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,740
你没有跟布兰登联系吗
So, you didn't keep in touch with Brandon?

585
00:27:54,726 --> 00:27:56,016
没有
No.

586
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:59,271
我希望能从你那儿了解一下第十首歌
I was hoping you would shed some light on song number 10.

587
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:01,840
专辑里只有九首歌
There were only nine cutson the album.

588
00:28:01,841 --> 00:28:03,161
是没错  但你记得那首
Yeah. But you'll remember the song.

589
00:28:03,162 --> 00:28:06,416
贾里德不喜欢其中和弦的那首
It was the one with the chords that Jared wasn't crazy about.

590
00:28:08,666 --> 00:28:10,688
你怎么不去找布兰登
Why don't you go talk to Brandon?

591
00:28:11,002 --> 00:28:12,806
因为这中间太复杂
Well, because it's complicated.

592
00:28:13,219 --> 00:28:15,421
我认为贾里德有影响到布兰登
I think that Jared got in Brandon's way.

593
00:28:15,422 --> 00:28:16,540
如果我问布兰登
And if i talk to Brandon,

594
00:28:16,541 --> 00:28:19,770
我满耳都是他挚友有多么铁
all I'm gonna get is an earful about how great his best friend was.

595
00:28:19,771 --> 00:28:22,421
所以你就找他女朋友来打听事实
So, you go to the girlfriend for the real story.

596
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:24,616
你怎么会认为我比较诚实
What makes you think I'm gonna be anymore honest.

597
00:28:24,617 --> 00:28:26,120
因为你曾在那
Because you were there.

598
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:30,387
那首歌引发他俩争执是有原因的  对吗
There's a reason that that song came between them, isn't there?

599
00:28:32,015 --> 00:28:34,614
是因为你  对吗
It was about you, wasn't it?

600
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,847
贾里德知道吗
Did Jared know?

601
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:49,380
他发现铁哥们喜欢自己的女友后
He must have been furious to find out

602
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,924
反应一定很强烈
that his best friend had feelings for his girl.

603
00:28:50,925 --> 00:28:54,301
的确  但并不是因为那首歌是写我的
He was. But not because the song was about me.

604
00:28:54,301 --> 00:28:56,065
那他为什么生气
Then what was he upset about?

605
00:28:56,066 --> 00:28:58,640
因为那歌写得很棒
At how good the song was.

606
00:28:59,202 --> 00:29:03,678
谁都知道布兰登有惊人的天赋
See, everybody knew that Brandon was scary talented.

607
00:29:03,678 --> 00:29:06,217
这也是贾里德把他招进乐团的始因
That's why Jared wanted him in the band to begin with.

608
00:29:06,308 --> 00:29:08,872
也只有布兰登自己不知道
And the only person who couldn't see it was Brandon.

609
00:29:08,873 --> 00:29:10,806
但在他写了那首歌后
But after he wrote that song--

610
00:29:10,807 --> 00:29:13,098
他开始威胁到贾里德
he started outgrowing Jared.

611
00:29:14,563 --> 00:29:19,052
他们为是否收录那首歌而大吵了一架
They had a fight about whether or not the song was going on the CD.

612
00:29:19,053 --> 00:29:21,000
唱片公司想要放
The record company wanted it.

613
00:29:21,001 --> 00:29:23,120
布兰登也希望放  但
Brandon wanted it. But...

614
00:29:24,132 --> 00:29:25,485
贾里德不希望
Jared didn't.

615
00:29:25,486 --> 00:29:27,903
他乘飞机从录音室回来
He got on that plane to come back to the studio

616
00:29:27,904 --> 00:29:30,183
打算亲手删除那首歌
and remove it personally.

617
00:29:31,363 --> 00:29:33,374
但他没有成功
Only he never made it.

618
00:29:34,734 --> 00:29:36,439
葬礼后
After the funeral,

619
00:29:36,834 --> 00:29:40,314
布兰登找齐每一卷录有那首歌的带子
Brandon gathered every recording he'd made of the song.

620
00:29:41,244 --> 00:29:42,735
快停下
Stop it.

621
00:29:42,812 --> 00:29:44,484
别管我
Just leave me alone.

622
00:29:46,292 --> 00:29:48,188
走开
Get out of here!

623
00:29:49,961 --> 00:29:51,462
滚
GO!

624
00:29:56,445 --> 00:29:58,175
他烧毁了所有的带子
He burnt everything?

625
00:29:59,029 --> 00:30:02,029
他这么做是为了尊重贾里德的愿望
He thought he was honoring Jared's wishes.

626
00:30:03,326 --> 00:30:04,291
我本以为你能够帮我
I really thought you were going to

627
00:30:04,291 --> 00:30:07,195
让他重新开始弹琴
be able to help me get him to play again.

628
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:10,950
稍等一会
Wait.

629
00:30:20,748 --> 00:30:23,194
这是他第一次录的样带
This is the first demo he ever made of it.

630
00:30:23,262 --> 00:30:25,262
跟歌词一起
The one with lyrics.

631
00:30:26,429 --> 00:30:28,724
他拿来问我的意见
He wanted to know what I thought about it.

632
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:32,655
告诉他  我很珍爱它
Tell him I cherished it.

633
00:30:39,578 --> 00:30:42,231
迪莉娅  真好
Hey, Delia. Excellent.

634
00:30:42,428 --> 00:30:43,817
我在找内德
Hey, I was actually looking for Ned.

635
00:30:43,818 --> 00:30:45,684
我想也许
And I was wondering if...

636
00:30:50,126 --> 00:30:52,203
你哭了  怎么了
you're crying.What's wrong?

637
00:30:52,204 --> 00:30:53,477
没事
Nothing.

638
00:30:53,789 --> 00:30:55,914
梅林达告诉了我
Mel told me, um...

639
00:30:56,914 --> 00:30:58,592
今天是查理的生日  对吗
today would be Charlie's birthday, right?

640
00:30:58,593 --> 00:30:59,777
是
Yeah.

641
00:31:00,196 --> 00:31:02,001
还有
That...

642
00:31:02,336 --> 00:31:05,131
我很想念跟儿子一起玩乐的时光
and I really miss hanging out with my son.

643
00:31:06,142 --> 00:31:08,484
我很抱歉  吉姆  又开始唠叨了
I'm sorry, jim. You didn't ask for this.

644
00:31:08,806 --> 00:31:10,921
如果你想谈谈的话
If you ever want to talk about it...

645
00:31:12,144 --> 00:31:13,351
我愿意听
this is cool.

646
00:31:17,993 --> 00:31:19,609
这是查理
That's Charlie.

647
00:31:21,275 --> 00:31:22,820
你们看起来很开心
You look very happy.

648
00:31:22,955 --> 00:31:24,365
曾经是
We were.

649
00:31:25,989 --> 00:31:28,184
12年了
For 12 long years.

650
00:31:28,808 --> 00:31:31,907
准备好了  只有13秒
We're ready.We got 13 seconds.

651
00:31:33,223 --> 00:31:35,085
笑一个
Smile.

652
00:31:36,747 --> 00:31:39,876
然后有一天  他在取款机边站着
And then one day he stopped at an atm.

653
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:42,269
被人抢劫了  还...
He got robbed and...

654
00:31:44,162 --> 00:31:47,092
天  我讨厌在说重点时流泪
god, I hate crying when I'm trying to make a point.

655
00:31:47,093 --> 00:31:48,389
没关系
That's all right.

656
00:31:50,836 --> 00:31:53,445
他们在前一天晚上发生过争执
They got into a big argument the night before.

657
00:31:53,446 --> 00:31:57,271
内德想预支零花钱买一款游戏
Ned just wanted to get his allowance early so he could buy this game.

658
00:31:57,515 --> 00:31:59,602
查理不同意
Charlie told him he'd have to wait.

659
00:31:59,961 --> 00:32:02,391
内德就叫他"混珠"
So, Ned called him an asshat.

660
00:32:02,966 --> 00:32:04,627
有这个词吗
Is that even a word?

661
00:32:04,628 --> 00:32:06,118
我也不清楚
I don't really know.

662
00:32:06,846 --> 00:32:11,024
出于原则  我们把他禁足了
So, we grounded him more on principle than anything else.

663
00:32:11,025 --> 00:32:14,423
但查理第二天就让他解禁了  可是
And Charlie was gonna let him off the hook the next day, but...

664
00:32:15,262 --> 00:32:17,295
他再也没回来
He never came home.

665
00:32:18,644 --> 00:32:22,147
所以我每年都要庆祝他的生日
That's why I want to celebrat his birthday every year--

666
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,869
这样
so that...

667
00:32:24,619 --> 00:32:28,706
内德才能记住和他父亲的美好时光
Ned can remember all the good things about his dad.

668
00:32:34,962 --> 00:32:37,580
孩子  你和我谈谈吧
Hey, kid  you and me. Let's talk.

669
00:32:38,566 --> 00:32:40,129
干嘛这个反应
What makes you say that?

670
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,336
你无缘无故地来找我
You coming to me, out of the blue?

671
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:44,759
我知道接下来会怎样  你会威胁我不要乱说
I know what comes next, you threaten me to stay quiet.

672
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,345
还好我把钳子放在后车厢了
Well, it's a good thing I left the pliers back in the van.

673
00:32:48,346 --> 00:32:51,042
听着  我妻子告诉了我
Listen, my wife tells me sometimes

674
00:32:51,043 --> 00:32:53,599
在你爸死后  你经常看到他
you used to see your dad after he died.

675
00:32:53,861 --> 00:32:55,007
坐下
Sit down.

676
00:33:01,028 --> 00:33:03,674
我父亲死后  我的状态很差
I was on pretty bad terms when my dad died.

677
00:33:04,009 --> 00:33:07,968
之后我强迫自己压抑着
And after I just kicked myself for not saying...

678
00:33:10,548 --> 00:33:12,280
不说出心里的想法
all the things I wanted to.

679
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:15,657
但梅林达对我说了句很有帮助的话
But then Melinda told me something that really helped.

680
00:33:15,658 --> 00:33:17,576
她哪儿都看不到我父亲
She didn't see my dad anywhere.

681
00:33:17,686 --> 00:33:18,697
那是好事
That's a good thing?

682
00:33:18,698 --> 00:33:19,877
那是天大的好事
That's a great thing.

683
00:33:19,878 --> 00:33:22,788
那代表着他已经超度了
'Cause it meant that he crossed over, you know.

684
00:33:23,542 --> 00:33:24,836
进入了那道光
Into the light.

685
00:33:25,042 --> 00:33:27,255
那是什么  天堂
What is that, heaven?

686
00:33:28,134 --> 00:33:30,604
我认为那是死后的极乐世界
I think it's a place the dead go to be at peace.

687
00:33:30,606 --> 00:33:35,552
只有看到亲人都过得很好时  他们才会去那
And they only go there when the people they've left behind are ok.

688
00:33:37,781 --> 00:33:40,504
我父亲已经不在这里了  对吗
My dad isn't here anymore, is he?

689
00:33:44,877 --> 00:33:47,048
-你有手机吗  -有
- You got a phone?  - Yeah.

690
00:33:53,174 --> 00:33:54,710
这是我手机号
This is my cell.

691
00:33:54,946 --> 00:33:57,182
你要想找我谈谈男人之间的事
You want to talk to me about guy stuff,

692
00:33:57,183 --> 00:33:59,082
只要给我一个电话
I'm a phone call away.

693
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:00,688
就这么办
This is how it works.

694
00:34:01,063 --> 00:34:04,574
不向任何人透露梅林达的能力  好吗
We don't tell anybody about what Melinda can do, ok?

695
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:06,892
我能替你保守任何秘密
I'll keep any secret you want.

696
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:08,453
你替我保守这个
You keep this one.

697
00:34:08,454 --> 00:34:09,861
可以吗
deal?

698
00:34:10,876 --> 00:34:12,683
好了  我得去上班了
All right. I gotta go to work.

699
00:34:17,569 --> 00:34:18,713
克兰西
Clancy.

700
00:34:18,714 --> 00:34:20,169
我能去吗
Can I come?

701
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,909
贾里德这样对你多久了
How long has Jared been doing this to you?

702
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,251
我不知道
I don't know.

703
00:34:34,252 --> 00:34:36,194
医生告诉我  我命不久矣时
When the doctor said I was dying,

704
00:34:36,195 --> 00:34:38,298
我试着寻找布兰登
I tried to reach out to Brandon.

705
00:34:38,299 --> 00:34:41,066
去告诉他我很抱歉
Tell him I was sorry.

706
00:34:41,622 --> 00:34:43,396
我当时很害怕
I--I was so scared.

707
00:34:43,794 --> 00:34:46,406
我曾如此待他
After the way I treated him.

708
00:34:46,693 --> 00:34:48,667
这就是你留下的原因吗
Is that why you stayed behind?

709
00:34:49,133 --> 00:34:50,841
为了道歉
To apologize?

710
00:34:50,933 --> 00:34:52,032
不是
No.

711
00:34:52,838 --> 00:34:55,536
我的生命中还有未了之事
Something in my life was unfinished.

712
00:34:56,084 --> 00:34:58,285
我以为是因为我的第十交响乐
I thought it was my symphony.

713
00:34:58,791 --> 00:35:01,997
后来  我看见我儿子表演
And then I saw my son perform.

714
00:35:01,998 --> 00:35:05,338
他弹得很棒
He was beautiful.

715
00:35:05,986 --> 00:35:07,485
我简直无法相信
I couldn't believe it.

716
00:35:07,486 --> 00:35:12,397
不敢相信  我居然从没让自己
Couldn't believe that I had never let myself...

717
00:35:13,848 --> 00:35:15,629
了解他
see him.

718
00:35:15,803 --> 00:35:19,740
而他却一直在阻扰
He kept on getting in the way.

719
00:35:19,946 --> 00:35:21,045
-贾里德  -对
- Jared.  - Yes.

720
00:35:21,046 --> 00:35:25,791
一开始就是他在破坏布兰登的演奏
From the beginning it was him destroying Brandon's playing.

721
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:28,718
每次我试着阻止他
But every time I try to stop him,

722
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:30,295
他令我虚弱无力
He drains me.

723
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:32,581
我认为贾里德在利用你
I think Jared is using you.

724
00:35:32,874 --> 00:35:34,792
你对布兰登的愧疚
The sadness over what you lost with Brandon,

725
00:35:34,793 --> 00:35:36,145
只会促使他更强大
it's only making him stronger.

726
00:35:36,146 --> 00:35:37,605
你必须抵抗他
You have to fight him.

727
00:35:37,699 --> 00:35:39,106
我不行
I can't.

728
00:35:40,114 --> 00:35:42,472
我一无所有了
I've got nothing left.

729
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,816
这些年我一直在找这张样碟
You know I've been searching for this demo for years?

730
00:36:14,817 --> 00:36:17,096
看看  你帮我找到了
And look at that--you lead me right to it.

731
00:36:17,503 --> 00:36:18,821
不  等等
No. Wait!

732
00:36:22,543 --> 00:36:25,105
你不想让布兰登弹这首曲子  我明白
You don't want Brandon to play the song. I get it.

733
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,282
但你不必这样  贾里德
There's a better way,Jared.

734
00:36:27,283 --> 00:36:29,570
你想说那能带来宁静  爱与理解的白光
Oh, you mean your little peace, love and understanding white light?

735
00:36:29,571 --> 00:36:31,119
对  我见过
Yeah. I've seen it.

736
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,285
你没弄懂  我现在的能力
What you don't get is that I can do

737
00:36:33,285 --> 00:36:35,451
是任何摇滚明星梦寐以求的
what every rock star dreams of now.

738
00:36:35,452 --> 00:36:37,176
我能让人颤抖
I can make people tremble.

739
00:36:37,177 --> 00:36:39,278
我能让土地移动
I can make the earth move.

740
00:36:39,279 --> 00:36:41,292
为什么要阻挠布兰登
Why get in Brandon's way?

741
00:36:41,293 --> 00:36:43,196
是我让布兰登认识自我的
I made Brandon who he is.

742
00:36:43,197 --> 00:36:45,185
我也能收回来
And I can take it away.

743
00:36:45,186 --> 00:36:46,876
你有什么
What do you have on your side?

744
00:36:46,877 --> 00:36:49,287
小狗和彩虹吗
Puppy dogs and rainbows?

745
00:36:49,827 --> 00:36:52,600
布兰登的父亲对我毫无威胁
Brandon's dad means nothing to me.

746
00:36:52,601 --> 00:36:54,570
你也是
And neither do you.

747
00:36:54,571 --> 00:36:56,267
我不会超度的
I'm not crossing over.

748
00:36:56,268 --> 00:36:57,735
绝不
Ever!

749
00:37:09,445 --> 00:37:11,622
我不明白为什么你要我这么做
I don't understand why you're asking me to do this.

750
00:37:11,623 --> 00:37:14,645
我父亲不会让我弹我的音乐
My dad is not going to let me play my music.

751
00:37:18,799 --> 00:37:20,015
看到了吗
You see?

752
00:37:20,134 --> 00:37:22,782
一直阻扰你的不是你父亲
Your father isn't the one that's been getting in your way.

753
00:37:22,958 --> 00:37:24,741
而是贾里德
It's Jared.

754
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,001
他不会这么做的
He wouldn't do that.

755
00:37:26,002 --> 00:37:27,201
他会
Yes, he would.

756
00:37:27,201 --> 00:37:29,732
他曾嫉妒你为杉迪写的那首歌
He was jealous about the song you wrote for Sandy.

757
00:37:29,775 --> 00:37:31,371
我毁掉了那首歌
I destroyed that song.

758
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:33,416
那还不够
That wasn't good enough.

759
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,490
你的天赋威胁到他
He was threatened by how good you are.

760
00:37:36,491 --> 00:37:39,146
而你父亲则不同
And the person who wasn't was your father.

761
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:44,547
告诉他  第一首歌是受到了
Tell him the first song was inspired,

762
00:37:44,803 --> 00:37:46,902
格伦·古尔德的启发
Glenn Gould-esque.

763
00:37:47,597 --> 00:37:51,382
他说你唱片第一首歌是格伦·古尔德风格的
He said the first song on your cd was like Glenn Gould.

764
00:37:51,383 --> 00:37:54,584
他  有听过我的音乐吗
He...listened to my music?

765
00:37:54,585 --> 00:37:56,100
是的
Yes.

766
00:37:56,417 --> 00:37:58,748
他活着时为什么不告诉我
Why couldn't he tell me that when he was alive?

767
00:37:58,749 --> 00:38:00,233
因为他恨你
Because he hated you.

768
00:38:00,443 --> 00:38:02,615
布兰登  你父亲想要帮助你
Brandon, your father wants to help you.

769
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,967
他希望你演唱给杉迪的那首歌
He wants you to sing Sandy's song

770
00:38:04,967 --> 00:38:07,181
以及所有你曾写过的歌
and everything else you've ever written.

771
00:38:07,181 --> 00:38:10,559
这也许会有帮助
Maybe this will help.

772
00:38:46,022 --> 00:38:47,547
发生了什么
What happened?!

773
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,533
是贾里德  他在伤害你父亲
It's Jared.He's hurting your father.

774
00:38:51,534 --> 00:38:53,480
你别想总是得逞
You can't just keep doing this.

775
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,853
要赌一下吗
Want to bet?

776
00:38:58,462 --> 00:38:59,866
就这样吗
Is that it?

777
00:39:13,921 --> 00:39:16,399
你可以弄断所有的琴弦
You can break all the strings you want, man.

778
00:39:16,571 --> 00:39:19,952
但再没有人能阻止我弹琴
No one is going to stop me from playing anymore.

779
00:39:43,957 --> 00:39:51,885
Running Away - Midnight Hour
* Don't lie and say that it's ok *

780
00:39:57,286 --> 00:40:05,527
* it's all right if there's nothing more to say *

781
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:15,189
那是什么
What does that mean?

782
00:40:16,584 --> 00:40:17,989
那道光
That light?

783
00:40:18,372 --> 00:40:20,857
那说明着你准备好超度了
It means you're ready to cross over.

784
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:26,480
他会没事的
He's gonna be all right.

785
00:40:28,783 --> 00:40:30,346
是的
Yes.

786
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:45,422
* And faster than you can follow me *

787
00:40:45,423 --> 00:40:49,661
* from this lonely place *

788
00:40:50,294 --> 00:40:52,999
我真希望我不必离开
I just wish I didn't have to go.

789
00:40:54,997 --> 00:40:56,494
不是现在
Not now.

790
00:40:58,713 --> 00:41:01,688
能再待会儿
Not just yet.

791
00:41:01,689 --> 00:41:06,223
* Yeah  I am leaving today *

792
00:41:06,223 --> 00:41:08,228
是时候了
It's time.

793
00:41:08,228 --> 00:41:10,895
* I'll never let you find me *

794
00:41:10,895 --> 00:41:13,476
* I'm leaving you behind with the past *

795
00:41:13,476 --> 00:41:15,458
谢谢你
Thank you.

796
00:41:15,458 --> 00:41:19,593
* No, I won't look back *

797
00:41:19,593 --> 00:41:27,288
* And I wanna hear your reasons wanna hear you tell me *

798
00:41:27,289 --> 00:41:34,312
* why I should stay try *

799
00:41:34,902 --> 00:41:38,033
* try to understand me *

800
00:41:38,034 --> 00:41:42,029
* try to understand what I say*

801
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:46,927
* when I say can't stay *

802
00:41:46,928 --> 00:41:54,394
* I'm... I'm moving off of this place leaving and I won't quit *

803
00:41:54,395 --> 00:41:59,259
* I'm running away *

804
00:42:00,412 --> 00:42:04,905
* I'm running away *

805
00:42:04,906 --> 00:42:11,048
* I'm leaving this place *

806
00:42:25,438 --> 00:42:27,874
你觉得这次重聚巡演怎样
So, how do you think the reunion tour went?

807
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:30,198
如果有纪念衫  我一定要买
Ohh, if there was a t-shirt,I would have bought it.

808
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:36,937
等我一会儿
Uh, give me a second.

809
00:42:36,938 --> 00:42:39,091
我得和某人谈谈
I have to talk to somebody.

810
00:42:43,873 --> 00:42:45,334
你没事吗
You'll be ok?

811
00:42:45,335 --> 00:42:46,852
没事的  相信我
Yeah. Trust me.

812
00:42:46,853 --> 00:42:49,072
他无法再伤害任何人了
He can't hurt anybody anymore.

813
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,036
-我就在那里  -好的
- I'll be over there.  - Ok.

814
00:43:00,584 --> 00:43:03,075
不过就是能唱几首歌
Just because you can sing a few songs,

815
00:43:03,076 --> 00:43:04,960
那并不代表什么
doesn't mean anything.

816
00:43:05,676 --> 00:43:07,525
并不代表你会成功
Doesn't mean you'll make it.

817
00:43:07,526 --> 00:43:09,635
也许他不需要成功
Maybe he doesn't need to make it.

818
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:12,154
他只是需要弹琴
Maybe he just needs to play.

819
00:43:13,749 --> 00:43:15,767
我知道你现在很生气
Look, I know how angry you are right now.

820
00:43:15,767 --> 00:43:18,184
但如果你愿意的话  我可以帮你超度
But if you'll let me, I can help you cross over.

821
00:43:18,898 --> 00:43:21,437
你认为你是镇里唯一有这能力的吗
Think you're the only afterlife game in town?

822
00:43:22,011 --> 00:43:24,049
还有其他的人
There are others around here--

823
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,610
特别希望见到我的人
people who are dying to meet me.

824
00:43:27,611 --> 00:43:30,477
那些灵魂  他们会答应你所有要求
Those other spirits, they will promise you anything.

825
00:43:30,597 --> 00:43:32,080
但他们都在说谎
They're all lying.

826
00:43:32,273 --> 00:43:35,596
会比曾经的 "摇滚大骗局"更糟吗
No worse than the usual rock and roll swindle.

827
00:43:41,435 --> 00:43:43,616
再会
Be seeing you.
