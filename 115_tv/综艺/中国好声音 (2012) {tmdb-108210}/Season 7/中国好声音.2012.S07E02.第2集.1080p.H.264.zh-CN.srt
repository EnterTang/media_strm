1
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,410
The bright moon sends my longing through a thousand miles

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,530
People reunion at the Mid-Autumn Festival

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:13,360
The 10th year of Sing! China in 2021

4
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:14,640
During these 10 years

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:19,450
Those beautiful songs accompanied the audience through every weekend

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,610
At the same time, these people who love music from all over the world find a common home

7
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,310
This year is the 10th year of Sing! China

8
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:35,710
It is very rare for a show to last for 10 years

9
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,340
It's a miracle 

10
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:47,880
Sing! China is definitely an indispensable show for the entire Chinese music industry

11
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,920
Many amateurs who have never had any audience

12
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,520
After a period of time, they became superstars

13
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,590
It is a very good platform for people who love to sing

14
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,950
It’s also a great show for the audience

15
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,660
Not only for the development of C-pop 

16
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,620
But also for the cultivation of talents

17
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:15,110
Sing! China has made a great contribution to the promotion of the music market

18
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,220
So I am looking forward to this show

19
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,330
It's the 10th years of Sing! China

20
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:30,370
I think I also witnessed the competitors become famous singers

21
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,750
I hope it can encourage the competitors

22
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,640
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival

23
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,440
The previous tutors and students gather together

24
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,840
They are ready to review Sing! China together through a special awards ceremony

25
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,660
To see what happened in this big family in the past 10 years

26
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,520
Dear audience and friends in front of the TV

27
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,880

Next, I want to ask, are you hungry?

63
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:43,360
Let’s share these mooncakes with our students

64
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,920

00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,780
Char Siew mooncake, I have never had it before

83
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,740
That means the moon is full in the sky

84
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,380

91
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,550
Let's continue the award ceremony of the main venue

92
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:21,720

97
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:43,530

Please

103
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:01,120
Tonight's Sing! China Mid-Autumn Festival special show has nothing to do with ranking

104
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:02,400
Or competition

105
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:06,640
It's a special award ceremony for the 10th anniversary of Sing! China

106
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:21,160
According to the data on various platforms each year, for example the number of comments,  reposts and the popularity, we will nominate and present the awards.

107
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:26,260
A lot of new music styles appear on the Sing! China stage every year

108
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,210
It makes niche music attract more audiences on this stage,

109
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,570
It Successfully broke down barriers

110
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,090
Next, we are going to present “The most barrier-breaking performance award”
 
181
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,450
Of 10th anniversary of Sing! China

111
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:40,610
The guest of honor, Liao Changyong and his assistant Zhang Bichen

112
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,690
Welcome

113
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,420
Tutor Liao, when you came to this show

114
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,980
It caused a huge sensation on the Internet

115
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,420
Why?

116
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:55,380
Because all the netizens think that your coming to this show

117
00:10:55,390 --> 00:11:00,270
It's something you have never done before

118
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,350
And everyone didn't expect you to come

119
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,790
So the netizens are looking forward to it

120
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,310
What do you think about being a tutor?

121
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:11,570
Actually there are many types of music

122
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,760
Whether it is classical, 

123
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:14,760
Folk music

124
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,120
Or pop music

125
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,330
In fact, they all learn from each other and respect each other

126
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:24,380
They should try to incorporate all kinds of music in

127
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:29,560
Sing! China is a very inclusive stage

128
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,400
I came here

129
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:37,960
It is also because of Sing! China is a inclusive show

130
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,400
So I feel very happy

131
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:43,440
I was wondering: "Why are you so surprised?"

132
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:45,680
All right

133
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:50,400
Then let’s take a look at the shortlist of Sing! China’s 10th anniversary “The most barrier-breaking performance award”

134
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,600

135
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:58,740

136
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,240
I'm so embarrassed

137
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,970
Congratulations to Dean Liao

138
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:59,130
This is a performance by us

139
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,960
Tutor Bichen was also in that season

140
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,320
Right

141
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,440
It's destiny

142
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,450
We Class 2 got together again in this way

143
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,210
Yes, indeed

144
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,570
Guo Qin, you come back to our big family today

145
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,330
You feel different, right?

146
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,610
Especially today, Dean Liao came to present you the award

147
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,290
Yes, I feel honored

148
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,450
This performance, because of the injuries

149
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:23,930
so

150
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,340
It has been very impressive to me 

151
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,440
Everyone helped me

152
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,120
I think this award is actually

153
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,180
Not just for me

154
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:39,310
But for all the staff and tutors on the stage and behind the scenes

155
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:50,080
Next, the 2019 Sing! China champion Xing Hanming and Guo Qin sing "Big Fish"

156
00:13:51,060 --> 00:14:02,590
Xing is here too

157
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,120
Thank you Guo Qin

158
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:52,720
Thank you Xing Hanming and Guo Qin

159
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:56,080
In fact, the year Guo Qin came to Sing! China

160
00:16:56,090 --> 00:17:00,000
She also officially became a student of Shanghai Conservatory of Music that year

161
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,350
So just now when Liao Changyong presented the award to Guo Qin

162
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,270
Guo Qin calls you Dean Liao

163
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,150
You didn't expect it too, right?

164
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,100
Yes, this student sang such a song

165
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,100
What do you think?

166
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,640
Keep working hard

167
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,990
Thank you, Tutor Liao is too strict

168
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,750
It's a big holiday!

169
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,100
Yes, it is

170
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,540
You must keep working hard

171
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:25,460
Because the road ahead is still long

172
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:28,260
We are just starting now

173
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,440
I'm not saying you didn't sing well

174
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,000
I mean you need to keep working hard

175
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,800
There is still a long way to go in the future

176
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,080
It needs us to explore

177
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,630
OK

178
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,510
Thank you Dean Liao

179
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,150
Next, Ronghao, you can have a good talk with Xing Hanming

180
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,550
I haven’t seen you for a while, Xing

181
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,430
I haven't seen you for a year or two

182
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,410
-Last time I came here 
-Last year, you came to see me, I remember, right?

183
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:54,410
Xing is my champion student in 2019

184
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,450
Sing! China's championship

185
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,550
When Xing sang just now

186
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:03,710
It's like my daughter married to someone who lives far away

187
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,150
I can only see her once a year 

188
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,790
It's a feeling can't be verbalized

189
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,190
You are not that old

190
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,750
Yep

191
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,150
No, just got into the state in advance

192
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,840
It's a rehearsal

193
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,960
Since the end of the competition

194
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,240
Xing has insisted on making her own music

195
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:22,560
Right

196
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:25,060
Music with a lot of your own ideas

197
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,060
She actually sent something to me

198
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:36,690
I wish Xing can be better and better on this road

199
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,170
It is what I said a few years ago

200
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,160
You are still young

201
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,350
Never stop being adventurous

202
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,510
This is very important

203
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,070
I'm sitting here again today

204
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,830
Then Xing Hanming was singing there again

205
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,470
I feel like I've traveled through time

206
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,550
And it feels like nothing has changed

207
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,760
Anyway, this is how I feel today

208
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:02,760
-Tutor for one day, father for life
-Not that serious

209
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,480
We are friends

210
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,150
What does Xing want to say to your tutor?

211
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,600
Tutor Li

212
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:15,420
I said before "I will laugh all the way to the bank"

213
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:18,380
Yes 

214
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,820
You can

215
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,820
Thanks

216
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,940
Let's give a round of applause to Xing Hanming again

217
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:23,660
Thanks Guo Qin

218
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:24,540
Thanks

219
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:25,220
Welcome

220
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:33,270
Next, we are going to enter a very artistic and fairy-like world together

221
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,470
Zhang Bichen brings us a song

222
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:45,920
She wrote this song all by herself

223
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:48,720
Please enjoy

224
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,910
"Life"

225
00:22:55,530 --> 00:23:01,760
Next, we are going to present "the most popular cover song" of the 10th anniversary of Sing! China

226
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,700
Li Ronghao and Jike will present awards 

227
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,540
Welcome

228
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,300
As a tutor

229
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,420
What is the most important thing when you cover a song?

230
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,780
I think no matter you cover a song or you are the original singer

231
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:16,640
The most important thing is this song is suitable for you, 

232
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,090
I think this is the most important

233
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:19,890
Ok

234
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:25,730
Then let’s take a look at “the most popular cover song” for the 10th anniversary of Sing! China

235
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,060
The shortlist

236
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,920
Please look at the big screen

237
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,130
The 10th anniversary of Sing! China

238
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:33,480
The most popular cover song nominations are

239
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:39,680
Sing! China's 10th anniversary most popular cover song

240
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,710
The original singer is Zhou Xingzhe "The Love That Never Lost Connection"

241
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:51,280
Thank you Zhou Xingzhe for writing such an excellent song

242
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,520
But because of work and pandemic

243
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:57,840
He didn’t get the chance to come to our 10th Anniversary Awards Ceremony

244
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:02,530
But he recorded a VCR to express his gratitude and excitement 

245
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,610
Let's take a look

246
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:05,970
Hello everyone

247
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,090
I am Zhou Xingzhe

248
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,210
Congratulations on the 10th anniversary of Sing! China

249
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,490
Thanks to Sing! China

250
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:17,170
So many singers with dreams have a stage of their own

251
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:22,900
And I hope you can keep people who love music on this stage

252
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,520
Thanks Sing! China

253
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,000
I wish you a happy 10th anniversary

254
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,150
Thanks, bye bye

255
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:31,420
I want to tell everyone that the data is really amazing

256
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:37,190
This song has been played 1 billion times so far

257
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,110
More than 10 million people added this song to their "favorite"

258
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,870
And many people who love this song covered this song

259
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,790
-I am the 1% 
-You did?

260
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,560
Yes, I did

261
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:50,080
I really like it

262
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,800
There are many people like you

263
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,770
One of them at the moment

264
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,570
She's sitting there too

265
00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:02,570
And after watching Sing! China, she covered the song

266
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:06,910
Her version is currently the most popular cover version

267
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,310
I already know who it is

268
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:10,270
Whose team is she from?

269
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,630
From Li Ronghao’s team

270
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:20,320
Wang Jingwen

271
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:24,080
Next, Wang Jingwen will sing

272
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:26,570
"Love That Never Loses Connection"

273
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,230
Nice

274
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:52,410
Thanks

275
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,450
Great

276
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,220
You just finished singing

277
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,530
Jike cheered for you right away

278
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,370
Beautiful

279
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,170
Do you like Jingwen's singing?

280
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,010
Yeah

281
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,770
She is adorable

282
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,290
And this song is also very nice

283
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,650
So after watching Sing! China

284
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:14,250
You immediately covered this song on that social platform

285
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:20,550
What kind of reason made you cover it?

286
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,970
Take it easy

287
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:30,300
Because this song is very beautiful

288
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,200
I have always loved this song

289
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:37,880
Then the version sung by Shan Yichun

290
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,500
Which is very beautiful too

291
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:44,180
It's beautiful

292
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:46,100
I really wanted to learn it right away

293
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,950
Ronghao, as the tutor of Jingwen

294
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,100
What do you think?

295
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:55,060
I saw her raise her head to sing for the first time

296
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,680
It’s nice to sing with your head up

297
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:00,640
Try to sing with your head up next time

298
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,800
This song is good

299
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:07,560
I actually sang your version of this song, right?

300
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:08,280
Thanks

301
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:11,160
Really? Did you cover the version she covered?

302
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,680
Yes, I realized when I heard the prelude

303
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,410
It turns out…

304
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,770
Thanks

305
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:20,850
Jingwen, this song was like her own song

306
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,250
No, it is an ability

307
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:28,770
Because she sing the songs she likes in her own unique methods for

308
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:35,560
Some very delicate transpositions, it is her style, I think it’s very good

309
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,640
Thanks

310
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,950
Sounds like we are back to the competition again

311
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,310
Isn't this Mid-Autumn Festival?

312
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,190
No

313
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,050
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival

314
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:48,170
Okay. Say hello to your family

315
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,280
Say something to your family

316
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,040
Ok

317
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:55,120
Hello my families, you are doing great

318
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,470
Ok

319
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,270
The family members also wish you success in the competition

320
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:00,790
Get good grades

321
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,750
Happy holidays

322
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:06,720
Happy holidays, everyone

323
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:06,880
Happy holidays

324
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:07,990
Happy holidays to you

325
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,350
You too

326
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,190
Over there

327
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,710
Does she look sleepy every day?

328
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,030
She has been in a trance; we both are in such a state

329
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,070
No, your head was in the clouds

330
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,030
She is in a trance all the time

331
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:35,120
 From 2012 to 2021, in these 10 years

332
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:40,640
There were 1596 songs in Sing! China

333
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,440
Last year, 

334
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:45,210
Sing! China also added an original track

335
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,890
A lot of good quality songs have been sung

336
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:54,810
So next, what we are going to present is the "Most Distributed Original Song" for the 10th anniversary of Sing! China.

337
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:58,570
Let us invite guest of honor, Li Ronghao and his assistant Jike Junyi

338
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,410
Welcome

339
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,930
Since last year, we have added this original track

340
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:11,130
It enriches the whole stage

341
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:18,490
Our tutor has a broader consideration of each student

342
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:19,680
I also hope that

343
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:27,020
In the future, more singer-songwriters can come to Sing! China and bring their songs to this stage

344
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,390
Ok

345
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:35,710
Then let’s take a look at the "Most Distributed Original Songs" of Sing! China

346
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,390
Please look at the big screen

347
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:45,470
"The Most Distributed Original Song" nominated for the 10th anniversary of Sing! China

348
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:20,440
Congratulations to these five students who won the Most Distributed Original Song Award

349
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:21,240
Next

350
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:30,800
The 10th Anniversary of Sing! China, the most popular original song, "Time for a Drop of Tear" from Zhao Zihua

351
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:37,570
Congratulations, Zhao, it seems you have experienced a lot of vicissitudes in this year

352
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,320
You have experienced a lot

353
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:47,060
Congratulations to Zhao Zihua , "Time For A Drop Of Tear"

354
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,340
Thanks

355
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:52,680
Ronghao, do you think it stirred up memories of last year

356
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:55,560
Because you were the first to turn around for Zihua

357
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:56,390
And

358
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:56,990
You know

359
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,430
It has been played 100 million times since it was sung on this stage

360
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:08,550
Over 1 million people add it to their "favorite". It is a masterpiece of Sing! China

361
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,670
Congratulations again to Zhao Zihua

362
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:11,320
Thanks

363
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:14,530
Zihua, you come back to Sing! China's big family again 

364
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,370
What’s on your mind right now?

365
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:19,190
I am back on this stage today

366
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:21,450
It's heartwarming

367
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:23,010
And then it's quite familiar

368
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:28,550
It’s like going back to my alma mater during the Mid-Autumn Festival

369
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,300
When you sang

370
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,940
Tutor Ronghao turned around first

371
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,070
Then Tutor Li Jian also turned around too

372
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,630
Can you tell us what caused you to turn around?

373
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,270
Ok

374
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,590
Actually, it’s the memory of last year, not a long time ago

375
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:49,320
Zhao is the same as many singer-songwriters I like

376
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:52,320
He not only writes good lyrics and music but also sings well

377
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:54,880
Because he has his own characteristics

378
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:58,060
No matter what kind of song he is writing

379
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:00,560
It will always be Zhao Zihua’s style

380
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:03,990
So I like him very, very much

381
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:07,840
I am very grateful to Zhao for coming to our Sing! China last season

382
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:11,800
He possessed great charm on this stage

383
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,390
Though it was only after one year

384
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,150
I find that there are too many memories

385
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,470
There is a very important fragment

386
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,030
The Zebra Forest of your team was in the finals last year

387
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:33,510
And the last song was the final song of the 9th Sing! China

388
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,950
You chose Zihua’s "Time For A Drop Of Tear"

389
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,040
Because actually Zhao

390
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:51,120
He was in my team during the blind selection

391
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,030
Then because of the competition system, he switched to another team

392
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,110
It has been a very regrettable thing in my heart

393
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,230
So I hope

394
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:04,530
My students can sing Zhao's song on the stage of the finals

395
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,210
For me

396
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,410
For our team

397
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,270
It is also a very perfect ending

398
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,200
Today is a perfect day

399
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:16,350
There is a different kind of feeling 

400
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,490
On this mid-autumn night

401
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:24,560
We will enjoy a brand new version of "Time For A Drop Of Tear"

402
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:34,040
Zhao Zihua, Zebra Forest will sing "Time For A Drop Of Tear "

403
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:47,950
Thank you Zhao Zihua and Zebra Forest

404
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,110
It seems to be back to last year again, right?

405
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,070
Tutor Ronghao

406
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,710
I said that when they showed up on the stage

407
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,270
I got goose bumps

408
00:41:55,740 --> 00:42:00,120
I see this picture because of these three, do you know?

409
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,360
They picked Zhao

410
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:06,210
Which almost drove me crazy last year

411
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:10,090
You saw that, right? Do you understand?

412
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,090
I understand

413
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:14,450
I really didn't know what to do

414
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,490
All right

415
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:23,720
After discussing, we decided to challenge Zhao

416
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,890
After a year

417
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:40,260
The 4 people who drove me crazy are back here at the same time, it is even worse

418
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:45,450
Finally I know why Harlem can’t stop crying before

419
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:49,450
-You know why we cried when we came back now
-I understand now, that feeling

420
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,370
When I saw the previous students

421
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:55,090
You three, are you all okay?

422
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:57,020
Pretty good 

423
00:42:57,370 --> 00:43:01,200
I think we have to get together tonight

424
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:02,600
They are all here

425
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:04,840
All four of them

426
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,090
Tutor Li is really touched today

427
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,290
He doesn't know what to say, there’s no logic at all

428
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:12,370
-He was simply moved,
-Yes, I was a talkative person

429
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:16,970
When I saw these kids come back

430
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,750
I am really touched

431
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:25,600
Zebra Forest, today you can sing this song that we all like with Zihua on the stage

432
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:27,800
What's on your mind right now?

433
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:31,220
It’s like last summer again

434
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:34,540
And when I was in this recording studio

435
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:36,780
I have never felt this way

436
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:40,180
Each scene flashed before my eyes,

437
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,290
Then I almost cried when I heard it

438
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:45,790
Zihua

439
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:49,010
I just felt that we were going to battle again

440
00:43:52,580 --> 00:44:00,370
Last year, Hacken paid particular attention to Zihua, and he liked his songs very much.

441
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,850
They are really good

442
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:07,960
I really want to say I like your songs

443
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:10,330
Thank you guys

444
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,290
Thank you both for the wonderful performance

445
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,370
This is a classic song by Anita Mui

446
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:16,650
I want to ask Hacken

447
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:20,210
What do you think about their performance just now?

448
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:21,180
So beautiful

449
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:26,260
Isn't Wu Keyue a student in my team?

450
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:29,300
She sings mostly Cantonese songs

451
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:34,920
I think this time she sings Mandarin song.  It feels very different

452
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:37,040
When you heard a different version, it feels different

453
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:37,960
Yeah

454
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:39,980
I met Pan Hong for the first time

455
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:45,420
I saw your performance last year too, they were both very good

456
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:46,900
OK

457
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:48,200
Thanks

458
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:53,520
Are their minds in sync?

459
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:58,390
When we two look at each other

460
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,550
I feel that We are on the same page

461
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,150
You can communicate by eyes

462
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,590
We met for the first time

463
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,430
It’s our first cooperation

464
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,310
But on this stage today

465
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,630
We really get each other

466
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,550
Yep

467
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:12,850
Great

468
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:15,210
It was fate that brought us together

469
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,140
You have bond of understanding between you

470
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:21,330
Wu Keyue also got 8 turning-around

471
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:22,470
Right?

472
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:38,990
Hacken

473
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:43,720
How did you feel when you heard Wu Keyue's song on the stage?

474
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:47,350
I have to press it

475
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:50,340
I have to press the button

476
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:52,300
It is a very firm attitude

477
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:57,780
So what's on your mind when you come to Langjiu Manor Today?

478
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:01,450
I feel so special when I came here

479
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:06,330
I sang "Manju Shahua" on the blind selection stage, it is very classic

480
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:10,400
Actually it was a song released in 1985

481
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:13,940
It's just like Langjiu

482
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:18,690
It feels that although it has existed for a long time

483
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,230
But it's like a good wine

484
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,030
 The longer it stays, the stronger it gets

485
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,070
No matter how many years have passed, it is still a classic song

486
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:30,380
Time to test the standard of beauty

487
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:32,220
Thank you both again

488
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:33,260
Thanks

489
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:39,440
In the past 10 years, many outstanding singers have been on the stage of Sing! China

490
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:40,480
After the competition

491
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:42,960
They didn’t stop working hard and writing songs

492
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:47,690
They have delivered a lot of good works for our Chinese music industry

493
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:53,920
Next, we are going to present the "Golden Record Award" for the 10th anniversary of Sing! China

494
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,610
Welcome to guest of honor, Hacken and Bichen

495
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:14,060
You are the champion of the third season of Sing! China 

496
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:15,200
Right?

497
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:18,880
Does that champion mean anything special to you?

498
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:22,160
The champion actually made a mark on me

499
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:23,840
The best result

500
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:25,280
So it makes you

501
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:31,000
So it makes you go to get better results

502
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:34,280
It is a great encouragement for me

503
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:37,620
I want to know 

504
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:43,240
What is the difference between the tutors that year and tutors of this year? Which one will be more handsome?

505
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:45,240
I was joking

506
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:46,680
Let's take a look at the VCR

507
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:50,760
Take a look at who will win the "Golden Record Award" for the 10th anniversary of Sing! China

508
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:52,320
Please look at the big screen

509
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:55,730
Sing! China,10th anniversary

510
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,450
Golden Record Award

511
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:59,970
Once they came with a dream

512
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,350
My name is Liqi

513
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:12,920
I will let more people know that I am Li Qi with a Bob haircut, who can sing love songs

514
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:14,760
My name is Jiang Dunhao

515
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:22,680
I really like this song

516
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:26,240
Then I just want to express it simply and beautifully

517
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:29,980
My name is Zhaxi Pingzuo

518
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:35,870
I'm so happy

519
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:36,990
Give me a hug

520
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:38,730
My name is Danzi

521
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,990
I have a wish

522
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,430
This kind of folk song can be incorporated into popular songs

523
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,190
Then I show it to everyone

524
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,510
They shine on the stage

525
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,290
When they get together, it's a fire

526
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,130
When they are scattered, it is a starry sky

527
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:01,970
Along the way, they didn’t change their original intentions

528
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,330
They are still young when they meet again today

529
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:08,050
Sing! China 10th Anniversary Golden Record Award

530
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:12,670
Awarded to the 10th Anniversary Student Collection "They Are Still Young When They Meet"

531
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,350
But when talking about maturity and transformation

532
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,350
I have to mention one of you

533
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:17,850
That's Bichen

534
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:24,070
I believe everyone still have a deep impression of her who was standing on the stage

535
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,070
Wearing a blue hat

536
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:29,310
She said now she has her own new song

537
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:30,830
She is also getting more and more confident

538
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,430
Her aura is getting stronger and stronger

539
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,510
But what remains unchanged is her dedication to music

540
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,640
Next, Bichen will sing

541
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:40,230
"The Midnight Toward Morning"

542
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:44,110
This song is from my first album

543
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:44,950
I haven't sung for a long time

544
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,070
As soon as I got there

545
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:49,970
Because I am very willing to sing this song when I am happy

546
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:52,730
I hope this song can bring strength and happiness to everyone

547
00:49:54,890 --> 00:50:09,010
Let's wave our arms together, OK?

548
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:00,570
Thank you all

549
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:03,340
Thanks

550
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:05,200
Talking about music style

551
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:07,920
You personally prefer lyrical songs?

552
00:54:07,930 --> 00:54:09,400
Or the songs which can get you energized

553
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:10,970
I like both

554
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:13,010
I think this is actually the same

555
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:15,730
Just like people have different emotions

556
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:16,650
When you have fun

557
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:17,490
When you are sad

558
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,330
When you are in love

559
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:21,050
Maybe you will also be very lively
897
00:54:21,060 -->00:54:26,490
Are there any stories in this song?

560
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,470
This song is very simple

561
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:36,130
It says we don’t want to besiege ourselves

562
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:38,010
We should dare to innovate

563
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:40,490
Dare to improve yourself

564
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,570
Unveil a new stage of better life

565
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:44,770
Make breakthroughs in music and life

566
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:47,370
It’s great to open up our horizons

567
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:49,650
I believe everyone will have different feelings about this song

568
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:50,650
Thanks

569
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:52,210
Please take a seat

570
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,800
On this Mid-Autumn Festival, we gather together at Langjiu Manor

571
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:57,360
Let's raise a toast

572
00:54:57,370 --> 00:55:00,530
To the dream chasers who keep walking on the road of music

573
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,560
Next, Let’s go back to the award ceremony of the main venue

574
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,830
Now let's go back to our awards venue

575
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:21,870
Next, Jike Junyi brings a song "Kapok"

576
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:39,000
Thank you Jike Junyi for the beautiful song

577
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:44,000
Just like the song "Don't Be Afraid" on the Sing! China stage for the first time

578
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:46,530
This "Kapok" is also a Yi song

579
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:50,970
As the only Chinese artist invited

580
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:57,370
The song was sung at the "Looking to the Future Action" event at the UNFPA headquarters

581
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,510
Thank you again

582
00:57:59,060 --> 00:57:59,910
Thanks

583
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,710
We also feel the love in the song

584
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,470
Because she has been singing "our love, come back" repeatedly

585
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:11,390
We also hope to pass on this love to more friends who love music on the stage of Sing! China

586
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:12,900
Next, 

587
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,140
On the Sing! China stage

588
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:18,730
When the tutors turned around,

589
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:20,930
They have formed an indissoluble bond with their students

590
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:26,260
So this tutor-student relationship is particularly unique and beautiful on this stage

591
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:32,910
The next award we are going to present is the 10th anniversary of Sing! China "the most tacit understanding of tutors and students"

592
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:37,920
I would like to invite the guest of honor Hacken, and his assistant Wu Mochou. The 10th Anniversary of Voice of China, the most tacit tutors and students
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,920
Let's take a look at the VCR
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,920
Sing! China 10th anniversary of the most tacit understanding of tutors and students, shortlist

593
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:54,680
Summer of 2012

594
00:58:54,690 --> 00:59:00,200
A northeastern girl with her unique voice was on the stage of Sing! China

595
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:00,840
Here

596
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:03,230
She met her tutor in life

597
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,160
I have nothing to say

598
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:08,360
She is the type I like

599
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:17,230
-I choose Harlem
-Let’s rock together,

600
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:20,720
Every performance, her passion rekindles his persistence in music

601
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:22,400
I'm recording an album recently

602
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:26,320
I think there seems to be a song that suits the two of us

603
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:27,090
What do you think?

604
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:44,550
Love is like the breeze and rain

605
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:46,360
Teaching benefits tutors as well as students

606
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:47,980
To cultivate fragrant peaches and plums with your love

607
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:49,420
We sing together on the same stage

608
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:53,180
I came to Sing! China because of Harlem

609
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:56,100
I think he is the one that can communicate with me

610
00:59:56,110 --> 00:59:57,740
I came to Sing! China

611
00:59:58,090 --> 01:00:01,000
I just want to find someone like Wu Mochou

612
01:00:01,610 --> 01:00:03,600
She is a gift from God

613
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:07,680
I met a tutor who understood me and supported me so much

614
01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:09,990
This is the happiest thing in my life

615
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,710
Thanks Wu Mochou

616
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:16,860
She made me reinvigorate the courage and persistence for music

617
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:19,480
Sing! China, 10th anniversary

618
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:22,430
The winner of the most tacit understanding of tutors and students is

619
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:30,350
Harlem, Mochou, my goodness

620
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:35,740
The winner turned out to be myself and Harlem

621
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:38,150
For this year, there are many reasons 

622
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,750
There are many other students

623
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:45,670
Including Harlem, who are not able to come to the 10th anniversary awards ceremony.

624
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:48,240
What does Mochou want to say to your tutor?

625
01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:51,690
I'm okay, I didn't cry

626
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:54,290
10 years ago

627
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,080
When I laughed, it was like I was crying

628
01:00:56,090 --> 01:00:58,000
When I cried it was like a laugh

629
01:00:58,790 --> 01:01:05,120
Now I am still learning and improving myself

630
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:11,280
But the person I have to thank for the rest of my life is

631
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:12,410
Harlem Yu

632
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:20,430
Then I hope that on the road of music in the future

633
01:01:20,530 --> 01:01:22,160
I can still meet him

634
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:28,710
I also hope that my lovely tutor Harlem will always be healthy

635
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:30,220
Always be very happy

636
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,360
Thanks

637
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:37,010
Next, Wu Mochou will sing "Superwoman"

638
01:04:24,410 --> 01:04:26,760
Thanks Mochou

639
01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:27,880
Thank you all

640
01:04:27,890 --> 01:04:29,760
Next

641
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:32,900
Hacken and Mo Chou will present awards

642
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:35,180
And it is also a very loving award

643
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:37,770
Sing! China, 10th anniversary

644
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:39,690
"The most loving class"

645
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,370
Please continue to present the awards

646
01:04:42,430 --> 01:04:44,900
It's the first time that Hacken came here to be a tutor

647
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:47,980
How is your relationship with all your students?

648
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:50,500
How do we get along?

649
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:56,320
In my team, everyone shares his favorite music

650
01:04:56,330 --> 01:05:00,400
We learn from each other

651
01:05:00,410 --> 01:05:01,160
Because I think

652
01:05:01,570 --> 01:05:04,870
There is no good or bad music, just whether you like it or not

653
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:07,790
I hope on this stage

654
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:11,940
Let's sing more music we like, OK?

655
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:12,460
Come on

656
01:05:12,470 --> 01:05:13,580
They are really great

657
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,310
Then do we have to watch the VCR again?

658
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:16,910
Ok

659
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:24,070
Let’s take a look at VCR, there are nominations for Sing! China's 10th anniversary "Most loving class"

660
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,310
The third year of Sing! China

661
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,710
Na Ying’s “Class 2" team, 

662
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:34,950
Every cruel battle made the tutors and students shed moving tears on the stage

663
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:36,550
I think in our "Class 2"

664
01:05:37,730 --> 01:05:41,290
There is no competition. For us, it is cooperation

665
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:45,810
We don't want anyone to leave this stage

666
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:48,970
No matter who is leaving

667
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:50,330
We are all in the “Class 2”

668
01:05:56,180 --> 01:05:57,370
The 7th year of Sing! China

669
01:05:57,380 --> 01:06:01,410
Jay Chou, "the wildest on the earth" team

670
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:03,020
I'm going to invite students to dinner today

671
01:06:03,030 --> 01:06:05,820
I cook by myself

672
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:07,740
Nicholas has 12 flavors

673
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:09,420
I have one more, 13 dishes

674
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:11,700
From table to stage

675
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:13,460
Don’t be "the strongest on the earth"

676
01:06:13,590 --> 01:06:18,140
To be "the wildest on the earth"

677
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:24,680
The 7th year of Sing! China, Li Jian, Siberian Tigers team

678
01:06:25,090 --> 01:06:29,360
The road is long , let's explore music together

679
01:06:29,370 --> 01:06:31,160
Sing well onstage

680
01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:32,800
Enhance physical fitness offstage

681
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:34,340
Drink more hot water

682
01:06:34,350 --> 01:06:35,690
Congratulations to Danzeng Nima

683
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:41,420
He share the glory of the annual championship with his tutor Li Jian

684
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:44,490
The 8th year of Sing! China

685
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:48,130
Li Ronghao's "Babe" team

686
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:49,930
There are many pitfalls in life, you know

687
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:52,650
With me, I can help you fill up a lot of pits

688
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:53,670
When you go out, you don't need to make that much effort

689
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,700
I think it's pretty good

690
01:06:56,230 --> 01:07:00,100
Members of our team, don’t take it as a separation

691
01:07:00,110 --> 01:07:03,260
Everyone has stayed in my team

692
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:06,770
They are teammates but also friends

693
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:11,170
They fought side by side and became each other's warmest friend

694
01:07:12,030 --> 01:07:14,140
Summer will pass

695
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:20,420
But the friendship of the "Babe" team will never end. In my heart, it’s like a family

696
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:32,150
A lot of talented people were shortlisted

697
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,900
Come on

698
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:45,880
My mandarin is just so-so

699
01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:47,600
You read it

700
01:07:48,370 --> 01:07:48,580
Ok

701
01:07:48,590 --> 01:07:56,970
Sing! China's 10th anniversary "most loving class", Li Ronghao's team, “Babe”

702
01:07:59,230 --> 01:08:01,190
Congratulations, Ronghao

703
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:07,320
Mr. Li Ronghao, please come to the stage to accept the award

704
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:09,730
Only two people came

705
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:12,090
So you come to accept the award in behalf of other students

706
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:12,970
Thank you

707
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:13,820
Excuse me

708
01:08:13,830 --> 01:08:15,740
I just forgot to put that trophy

709
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:20,220
-It's the thought that counts
-Could the staff take the trophy here?

710
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:20,980
Thanks

711
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:26,550
Here comes the trophy

712
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:30,650
Oh my goodness, such a great trophy

713
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:33,290
My goodness, what are you doing here?

714
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:38,720
My goodness why are you all here?

715
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:42,190
Have you been here for a while?

716
01:08:42,610 --> 01:08:43,240
Here we go again

717
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:45,640
We have been here for the whole day

718
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:49,410
Didn't you expect it?

719
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:51,330
I didn't expect it

720
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:55,050
Did you really think I forgot to bring the trophy?

721
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:58,290
I didn’t expect it, not at all

722
01:08:58,460 --> 01:08:59,130
Help

723
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:00,810
I'm gonna cry

724
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:04,640
I know why you won, there is a very important reason

725
01:09:04,650 --> 01:09:08,080
Because they really have a very good friendship

726
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,870
They keep in touch and interact a lot

727
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,990
I actually know

728
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,510
We have a group chat for three years, they never stopped chatting there

729
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:17,520
Including their "moments" on Wechat

730
01:09:17,530 --> 01:09:20,080
I often saw these two get together, and the three get together

731
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:22,400
They have kept in touch for three years

732
01:09:22,410 --> 01:09:23,800
At the end of the competition

733
01:09:23,810 --> 01:09:26,720
There were some classmates who left first

734
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:29,290
But since then, they have been in touch for three years

735
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:30,730
Because of this

736
01:09:31,010 --> 01:09:34,960
I am touched too

737
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:35,840
So special

738
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:36,930
Yeah

739
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:41,090
Thanks to the show for letting me know these young musicians

740
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:46,120
I hope they get better and better

741
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,910
I can't talk too much

742
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:52,000
Li Ronghao, if you were a girl, you would have burst into tears 

743
01:09:52,010 --> 01:09:54,120
I won't

744
01:09:54,130 --> 01:09:56,640
They also prepared a small gift for you

745
01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:57,720
You Bowen, what is this?

746
01:09:58,430 --> 01:10:03,040
My friends and I prepared a fried lotus root box for you

747
01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:06,580
Why fried lotus root box? Every time the gift is so sloppy

748
01:10:06,830 --> 01:10:12,380
This is a more meaningful gift

749
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:15,170
I hope you can be harmonious with your family

750
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:17,510
Doesn't it sound like…

751
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,830
"Occasionally harmonious"?

752
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:23,030
I got you, special harmony

753
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:24,830
Last time they gave me a self-portrait

754
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:26,430
Which shocked me

755
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:27,670
I haven't used this word "shock" for a long time

756
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:28,070
You know

757
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:29,880
It shocked and embarrassed me

758
01:10:29,890 --> 01:10:31,000
You sent a lotus root box today

759
01:10:31,010 --> 01:10:32,480
Let's eat together when we finish recording

760
01:10:32,490 --> 01:10:35,720
Once again we wish all the students

761
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:37,750
Have a bright future

762
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:38,270
Again

763
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:39,590
Thanks Li Ronghao

764
01:10:39,990 --> 01:10:46,020
Next, Huang Xiaoyun will sing "Take Me to A Place Far Away"

765
01:13:42,930 --> 01:13:46,280
Thank you Huang Xiaoyun

766
01:13:46,290 --> 01:13:51,360
Embrace your tutor like the first time on the stage of Sing! China

767
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:56,930
It feels like I’m here for the test

768
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:58,940
So happy

769
01:13:58,950 --> 01:14:04,260
The smile of Wang Feng in the picture was particularly brilliant

770
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:05,890
I had a beard back then

771
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:08,320
Yep

772
01:14:08,330 --> 01:14:12,370
She told me that she wanted to go to the conservatory

773
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:15,470
This is always her dream

774
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:19,270
Because she thinks she can sing forever

775
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:22,470
But she hopes to learn more

776
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:27,330
And when she was about to graduate

777
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:32,120
At that time, I had heard some friends around me talking about her

778
01:14:32,130 --> 01:14:35,520
When her "The Stars and the Sea" came out

779
01:14:35,530 --> 01:14:40,560
More people know Huang Xiaoyun

780
01:14:40,570 --> 01:14:43,010
I am really happy for her

781
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:45,730
She was my student

782
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,150
About the Central Conservatory of Music

783
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:51,950
Actually I took the exam twice

784
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,870
There was a little mistake the first time

785
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:55,430
I didn’t dare to bother Wang Feng

786
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,790
Until a year later

787
01:14:57,140 --> 01:14:57,900
After I was admitted

788
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:59,140
I told Wang Feng

789
01:14:59,150 --> 01:15:02,820
I was admitted to the Central Conservatory of Music where you graduated

790
01:15:03,630 --> 01:15:04,130
It's true

791
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:08,990
This stage of Sing! China is so beautiful

792
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,230
Thank you Sing! China for giving us such a wonderful fate

793
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:21,150
In Sing! China's previous battles, there were many classic duets 

794
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:27,190
In order to choose a song suitable for the students, the tutor worked hard

795
01:15:27,330 --> 01:15:31,430
Next, the last award tonight

796
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:35,700
Sing! China's 10th anniversary "Most Unforgettable Duet"

797
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:41,250
Guest of honor Wang Feng and his assistant Huang Xiaoyun

798
01:15:45,790 --> 01:15:52,660
Liao, you know the "competition system” used to be crueler,  there was "internal PK"

799
01:15:52,670 --> 01:15:59,020
-I know
-In the case of internal PK, we decide who wins by one song

800
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:04,520
And in this "internal PK", there are so many wonderful songs

801
01:16:04,530 --> 01:16:06,440
Now let’s take a look at the VCR

802
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:13,670
Shortlist for the 10th anniversary of Sing! China "Most Unforgettable Duet"

803
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:20,860
Wang Feng's team "Hey Jude"

804
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:27,990
I have seen this before

805
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:46,340
Na Ying’s team

806
01:16:46,350 --> 01:16:48,100
-Lake Baikal
-This is also good

807
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:06,450
Nicholas Tse's team "Light Years Away"

808
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:17,140
Li Jian’s team, "Water Flower + La Vie En Rose"

809
01:17:47,610 --> 01:17:49,560
Wonderful
01:17:59,610 --> 01:18:01,560
I think it's possible
01:18:02,590 --> 01:18:06,300
Sing! China's 10th anniversary "Most Unforgettable Duet"

810
01:18:16,590 --> 01:18:19,300
Sing! China's 10th anniversary "Most Unforgettable Duet"

811
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:20,510
Wang Feng' team

812
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:25,720
Congratulations to Wang Feng's team, "Hey Jude"

813
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:33,140
"Most Unforgettable Duet", Wang Feng and Bi Xia come together to accept this honor

814
01:18:35,290 --> 01:18:37,720
Bi Xia, please come to the stage

815
01:18:37,730 --> 01:18:41,640
And accept this award with Wang Feng

816
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:47,080
In fact, this honor belongs to the entire Wang Feng’s team, belongs to Bi Xia and Zhong Weiqiang

817
01:18:47,910 --> 01:18:54,780
We want to send the blessing to Zhong Weiqiang, because he is also watching our show

818
01:18:54,790 --> 01:18:56,100
We are very grateful to him as well

819
01:18:56,110 --> 01:18:59,380
Thank him for making so many beautiful memories on this stage

820
01:18:59,390 --> 01:19:00,540
Thanks

821
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:07,170
Then Xiaoyun will give this trophy to your tutor and Bi Xia

822
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:12,240
I think Bi Xia should be the most suitable one to hold it

823
01:19:12,610 --> 01:19:16,000
And also to all my students of 2013

824
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:18,440
This is the honor of our team

825
01:19:18,450 --> 01:19:21,770
I really want to

826
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:24,650
I have to break this in half and give it to Simon

827
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:26,050
I will give him more than half

828
01:19:26,430 --> 01:19:28,910
Because when you played the video just now

829
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:30,360
I really miss Simon 

830
01:19:30,370 --> 01:19:32,920
As I mentioned before, I thought

831
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,390
The one with the helmet was Simon

832
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:37,310
There is one behind

833
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:38,590
That's an alien

834
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:41,550
And his body shape is quite similar

835
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:45,350
Then I thought it was a surprise again

836
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,150
Then I found out

837
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:48,910
I seemed to think too much

838
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,510
But I think, Simon, no matter how far apart we are 

839
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:54,310
Like what the tutor said before

840
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:58,400
His spirit, old naughty boy

841
01:19:58,730 --> 01:19:59,990
8 years have passed

842
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:00,830
He's almost 70

843
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:02,480
He had his birthday two days ago

844
01:20:02,490 --> 01:20:04,280
I sang a birthday song to him

845
01:20:04,290 --> 01:20:06,380
Then he went out to play and post videos

846
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:08,160
And he plays in a band 

847
01:20:08,390 --> 01:20:09,100
Live performance

848
01:20:09,110 --> 01:20:11,190
Now he plays in a band, Rock and Roll

849
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:15,470
Yes, full of energy

850
01:20:15,810 --> 01:20:19,400
So there is actually no real separations on the stage of Sing! China

851
01:20:19,410 --> 01:20:21,160
Although summer will pass

852
01:20:21,170 --> 01:20:22,400
The competition will end

853
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:24,550
But friendship lasts forever

854
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,030
We are best friend forever

855
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:28,230
We will always be a big loving family

856
01:20:28,710 --> 01:20:32,370
We also invited all our tutors to come to the stage together

857
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:33,690
Let's toast together

858
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:39,440
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival everyone

859
01:20:41,180 --> 01:20:47,490
This Friday at 8:20, Zhejiang Satellite TV 2021MC Sing! China "Tutor Decisive Battle"

860
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:49,250
We will see you soon
