All right, after an amazing
season premiere, we are back.

64
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,424
Tonight we got four more stars

65
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,729

their identity a secret

66

68
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,872
Yeah, flashy floor!

69

That's what happens
when you get a hit show.

70
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,103
You get a nice new floor.
Look what it does.

71

a waterfall right now.

Whoo! Whoa!

75
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:35,245
Or maybe I want something thick
like Robin with wavy hair.

76
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,245
Yeah. Yeah.

77
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:40,287

‐ My God.

81
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,870
Tonight, we will see four new
celebrity singers perform two by two.

82
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:54,272
After each face‐off,
the studio audience and panel

83
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,474
will vote for their favorite
performance,

84
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:58,936
and the winners will get
to sing another day.

85
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,965
The loser of each face‐off

86
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,741
will perform again
in the smackdown.

87
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,210
The panel will then decide
who they want to see again,

88
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,150
and the loser will be unmasked
and sent packing.

we can free some clues

116
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:27,131
from the spider's web.

117
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,903
I'm the Black Widow
because like me,

118
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:35,036
they hide in plain sight.

119
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,771
And when they strike,
you know it.

120
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,338
Frankly, I've been packaged
my entire life.

121
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:44,437
I think a Sagittarius?
Is that what that sign was?

122
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,011
And after years of living
in the public eye,

123
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,620
you're in my house now.

124
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,753
Welcome to my empire.
Mwah‐ha‐ha‐ha!

125
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,889
Empire? Is it Oprah?

126
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:58,885
And now I get to be here to share
the real threads of who I am.

127
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,859
So consider this
the director's cut of my life...

128
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,028
Director's cut.
She's an actor.

129
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:07,027
...where you'll find
I'm a little edgier, darker,

130
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,440
and more alien
than you know me to be...

131
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:12,342
She's a lot edgier, so it's
probably a fluffy persona.

132
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:15,005
...maybe what you'd find
in the deleted scenes.

133
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,835
You better believe
on this stage,

134
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,810
I'm gonna be good as hell.

135

164
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,817
I think I've been bit
by the Black Widow.

165
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:12,957
What a great way
to open the show. Come on!

166
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:15,056
Wow. You
rocked the stage, Black Widow.

167
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:17,698
Jenny, talk to her
about her performance.

168
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:20,504
I am so blown away. This is
the first time this season

169
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,667
I've gotten the chills
all over my body.

170
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:24,366
That's how amazing
your voice was.

171
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,307
The fact that you came out
with your first song

172
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:28,483
and choosing
a Whitney Houston song says,

173
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,211
‐ "Listen, I know what
I'm doing." ‐ Yes.

174
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:32,877
‐ "This is what I do
for a living." ‐ Yep.

175
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:35,746
‐ "And I am here to win."
‐ Whoo!

176
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:38,915
This season has been
absolutely outstanding

177
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,615
in terms of the quality of performances.
This is so strong.

178
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,858
I'm just completely
blown away.

179
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,693
Amazing job.

180
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,259
Are you picking up on any clues from
the performance or the package?

181
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:50,258
Definitely from
the clue package.

182
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,070
I saw a film slate, so that makes
me think she is an actress.

183
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,203
So I tried to connect some dots

184
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:58,368
and thought maybe a actress
that can sing like that.

185
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:02,378
Maybe from "Glee."
Amber Riley possibly?

186
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:05,082
- ‐ Amber can sing.
- That's a good guess.

187
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:07,405
Ken, you pick up
on any clues, doc?

188
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,550
I don't need
no more clues, Nick.

189
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,175
I know exactly who this is.

190
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,420
- ‐ ‐
- Okay, think about this.

191
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:15,385
You are an actor.
You played many different roles.

192
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:19,425
This may be one of
my castmates from "Community,"

193
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,132
- ‐ the first TV series I was on.
- ‐

194
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:24,204
My good friend,
Yvette Nicole Brown,

195
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:28,034
who was never able to express
her range on "Community,"

196
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,371
and everybody on the show
knew she was an amazing singer.

197
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,267
So, well done, Yvette.

198
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:34,108
I love you.
I'll see you at the aftershow.

199
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:36,744
That's a serious guess
from Dr. Ken.

200
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,080
I'm serious this year, Nick!

201
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:43,446
Well, Robin, we know that your
always in tune with the clues.

202
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:47,446
‐ What do you think? ‐ She moves
very nimble and very, you know, ‐‐

203
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,490
She just‐‐

204
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:54,286
‐ Dang. She be dropping it low.
‐ The masked squatter.

205
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,260
Yes, Nick! Come on, Nick!
Come on, Nick!

206
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:03,044
Whoo! ‐ Maybe it's
Cardi B after that move.

207
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,043
But no, the one thing
I got from the clues

208
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,205
was the darker and edgier
than we're used to,

209
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,443
so it might be somebody,
you know,

210
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:10,608
who's usually bubbly
on television‐‐

211
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:12,547
That's Yvette Nicole Brown, Robin Thicke.
That's what I said.

212
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,452
Last year we thought somebody

213
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:17,275
might have been
Sherri Shepherd for a while.

214
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,050
‐ Yvette Nicole Brown.
‐ And maybe she heard how much

215
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,219
we were saying her name
on the last year

216
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,986
and wanted to come on,
so, who knows?

217
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:23,915
‐ Yeah, exactly. ‐ Nick: That
is definitely a good guess.

218
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,530
All right, well, we should probably
hear from the Black Widow herself.

219
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:27,663
‐ Yes, please.
‐ Whoo!

220
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,527
‐ Yes!
‐ Yes.

221
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:33,596
What makes you
the Black Widow?

222
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,766
I like to hide

223
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:40,405
until it's time to feast.

224
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,243
"Hide until it's time
to feast"?

225
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,038
‐ I got nothing.
‐ That's Yvette Nicole Brown.

226
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,680
She'd play
hide and seek as a kid.

227
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:49,715
‐ And then‐‐ guys, it all makes sense.
‐ There it is.

228
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:52,692
Ladies and gentlemen,
one more time

229
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,452
for the Black Widow.

230
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,291
<i>Our panel thought</i>
<i>one of these celebrities</i>

231
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:58,726

<i>I was a little
nervous coming into it,</i>

234
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,434
but to be able
to stand on stage,

235
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,700
nobody know my face and perform
like I've always wanted to

236
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:14,211
has brought me utter joy.

00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,946
Leopard is hitting on me.

‐
‐ <i>And later...</i>

242
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,964
The time has come for
our masked moment of truth.

00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,464
Take it off! Take it off!

244
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,625
No!

245
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,234
‐ My God.
‐ We totally got tricked.

246
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,368
‐ Love you, too. ‐ Aww,
she's got a crush on you.

247
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,310
I love you!
I love you, Mom!

248
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,109
‐ She said Jenny.
‐ I thought you said Kenny.

249
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,681
‐ Come on, come on.
‐ I thought it was a "K."

250
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,220
I hear what I want to hear.

251
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,316
I'm calling you Kenny
from now on.

<i>♪ Who is that? ♪</i>

253
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:08,159
We're back
on "The Masked Singer,"

254
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,998
where we meet the craziest
characters,

255
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,663
and I'm not even talking
about our panel.

256
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,431
Black Widow just went wild

257
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,340
with "I Wanna Dance
With Somebody."

258
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,442
Now let's all look closely

259
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,374
for any revealing spots
on the Leopard.

260
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,845
I am the Leopard

261
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:31,084
because I am adaptable
and can survive anywhere,

262
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,250
even under
the harshest conditions.

263
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,890
And I know what it's like
to be at the top.

264
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:40,727
In my career,
I've been a heavy‐hitter.

265
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,333
No one could catch me.

266
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:43,695
"Catch me"?
Are they a runner?

267
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,133
So, was a big star
at one point.

268
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:49,369
But now all anyone wants
to talk about

269
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,665
is the celebrity aspect.

270
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:54,468
Yeah, scandals.

271
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,880
You know, I really don't care

272
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,243
what they say about
what I'm wearing,

273
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:00,811
or even my relationships.

274
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,850
‐ Ooh, like a Katie Holmes. ‐
What about, like, Gwen Stefani?

275
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:07,186
Yeah. ‐ But now I'm
stripping away the headlines.

276
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:10,863
and everything that has come
to define me.

277
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:14,463
Behind this mask, I will show
the world why I have been

278
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:18,457
and will always be
the Leopard.

279
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:26,969
‐ Leopard is so tall.
‐ I know. She's an Amazon.

310
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:55,327
♪ Somebody to ♪

311
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,495
♪ Love ♪

312
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,134
Yes!

313
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,100
‐ Come on!
‐ That is amazing.

314
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:08,371
I think we've all found
somebody to love.

315
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,111
It's the Leopard!

316
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,112
That was lovely.
‐ That was awesome.

317
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:16,121
- ‐ That was awesome!
- That was awesome.

318
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:18,892
You look so handsome,
young man.

319
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,551
Leopard is hitting on me.

320
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:23,521
‐ Nick, we totally got tricked.
‐ Really?

321
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,629
We thought it was a female.
It's obviously a man.

322
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,692
- It's a Leopard.
- ‐

323
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:32,501
‐ Rawr. ‐ Nicole, one Pussycat
performer to another.

324
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:35,125
With a voice like that,
there's somebody major

325
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,641
underneath
that Leopard costume.

326
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:42,343
Like, that was just so regal.
Your presence is so strong.

327
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:46,048
‐ Right. ‐ Darling, flattery
will get you everywhere.

328
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:49,222
Your voice is like‐‐
it's soulful.

329
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,622
‐ It's mature, it's seasoned. ‐ Keep
it coming, darling. Keep it coming.

330
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,685
Don't stop. Don't stop.

331
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:58,415
Robin, you're picking up
on clues.

332
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:01,091
‐ I know that look. ‐ Well, there's
a couple of things going on here.

333
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,860
At first, you know,
before I heard the voice,

334
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:04,199
I heard "heavy‐hitter" meaning

335
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,933
somebody who might have had
a lot of hits.

336
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,429
And now it's about,
"What am I wearing?"

337
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:11,701
So, I'm kinda catching,
like, a Billy Porter.

338
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:15,171
‐ Nice. ‐ Extra fashionable, like,
king of the Met Ball fashion.

339
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:17,281
And he likes to hold the mic
with two hands like that.

340
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,283
‐ ‐ Ken, you picking
up on any clues?

341
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,605
I know exactly
who this is,

342
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:24,621
as I always do.
Dr. Ken is in the house.

343
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:29,724
I think this is an obvious
pop star who has had many hits,

344
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,359
who's had celebrity scandal.

345
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:34,064
It might be someone from, like,
Take That in Britain.

346
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,656
It could be a Robbie Williams,
who had a lot of hits

347
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,329
and has had a resurgence,
been on Broadway,

348
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,528
‐ is an amazing actor, and I
see‐‐ ‐ Okay, hold on, Nick.

349
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:44,771
Well, you guys have talked about that
this person is a huge celebrity.

350
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,507
- ‐ But Robbie Williams is a huge celebrity.
- No, Robbie doesn't‐‐

351
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:51,512
‐ Sorry, Robbie. ‐ My idea of a huge
celebrity is like a Jamie Foxx.

352
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:54,777
Someone who's funny, who controls
their voice, who wants to trick us.

353
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,517
No, that's not Jamie Fo‐‐ Everybody knows
Jamie's favorite animal is the platypus.

354
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,324
Jamie would never go anywhere
near a leopard outfit.

355
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,185
All right, Leopard,

356
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:07,888
what makes you the Leopard?

357
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,230
Well, darling,
isn't is obvious?

358
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:13,497
Leopards can be fierce,

359
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:17,396
and yet, so divine.

360
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,510
‐ Fierce and divine? ‐ Wow,
you're a great help, Sherlock.

361
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:22,712
‐ So divine.
‐ So divine.

362
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,535
‐ I've got nothing.
‐ That's definitely Jamie Foxx.

363
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,050
‐ That didn't give you anything?
‐ Jamie Foxx is not that tall.

364
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:29,053
He's a friend.
He's not that tall.

365
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:31,115
How you you know
everyone's height, Ken?

366
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:34,393
'Cause I'm a doctor, Nick!
I'm a doctor.

367
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,993
All right.
He likes my tux.

368
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,756
You don't have‐‐

‐ See?

370
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,731
‐ It's definitely Jamie Foxx.
‐ Thank you.

371
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,627
Keeping my distance
from this Leopard.

372
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:49,169
Get someone
from the zoo in HR.

373
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,065
Either way,
whoever you think it is,

374
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:53,607
we definitely know
it was an amazing performance.

375
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,143
‐ Amazing job, amazing job.
‐ Ladies and gentlemen.

376
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:58,737
You're a superstar.

377
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,251
<i>Our panel thought that

<i>Who do you think it is?</i>

380

All right, it's time for

Before the break, our panel

for who they want to see

the Black Widow
or the Leopard.

391
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:01,141
The votes are in,
and the winner

392

393

Come on!

Black Widow, get outta here
before the Leopard attacks you.

399
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:25,359
Go back to your lair
and twerk later.

400
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:29,071
Black Widow was twerking
right now.

401
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:31,465
All right, Leopard,
it's not over.

402
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:34,137
You got some smackdowning
to do later.

I'm sorry, Leopard.

404
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:39,482
You'll sing for one last chance
to keep your mask on,

405
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:42,715
but for now, go back to

What's up, everyone?
Welcome to my ZooTube Channel,

the real story of becoming
a flamingo.

I'm gonna let you in
on all my tips and tricks

from beauty to fashion
to life advice.

448
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:38,098
It could be a famous YouTuber
that does makeup.

449
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:40,904
Who's into beauty?
Is it a Kardashian?

450
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:44,496
Listen, I know what it's like
to feel trapped in your career.

Now I'm here to take back
control of my destiny.

- Could be a clue.

455
00:21:57,283 --> 00:22:00,853
‐ Kelly Rowland.
‐ It's why I chose the Flamingo,

456
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,390
because they represent
new beginnings.

457
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:06,185
It's about damn time
this badass birdie

458
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:08,058
got to show
her feathers again.

Yeah, I wouldn't know
where to start with that.

All right.

486
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,510
Still shaking it.

487
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:36,981
Flamingo! Flamingo!

488
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:39,949
Nicole, tell her
about her performance.

489
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:44,259
Fla‐min‐go.
I am here for you, Flamingo,

490
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:48,563
and your snatched body,
your "ma‐chest‐ic"‐‐

491
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:52,127
‐ "Chest‐ic"?
‐ "Ma‐chest‐ic..."

492
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:56,337
- ‐ voluptuous curves.
- All right, all right.

493
00:23:56,402 --> 00:23:59,572
You sounded amazing
on that song.

494
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:02,138
I think that voice
was definitely part of a group,

495
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:03,977
and we've bought her albums before.
That's what I'm thinking.

496
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:06,983
That's how good you are,
Flamingo.

497
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:09,616
Nicole, you picking up
on any clues?

498
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:12,282
Definitely there's
a youthfulness about her.

499
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:14,291
She, you know, she‐‐
she backing it up up there.

500
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:16,793
Ay, ski, ska.

501
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:20,325
There's the fashion beauty
from YouTube,

502
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,232
so there's obviously someone
a bit younger,

503
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,634
someone from, like,
Danity Kane or Fifth Harmony

504
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:27,798
or Destiny's Child.

505
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:29,026
I don't agree with that.

506
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:31,041
Initially when I saw
the clue package,

507
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:32,473
I was thinking more,
quite frankly,

508
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:33,708
a disgraced YouTuber.

509
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:35,372
Maybe it was someone
who had fallen from grace,

510
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:37,241
like‐‐ like‐‐
with all due respect,

511
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,179
you know, like Olivia Jade
or something like that.

512
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:40,914
‐ I didn't know, going on that before.

513
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,350
No way!

514
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:45,315
Or just forget what I said.
Maybe it's Chuck Schumer.

515
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:48,694
I don't know these things.
I'm a dummy.

516
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:51,164
Well, you know what? I think we
should ask the Flamingo a question.

517
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:53,693
‐ Right, guys?
‐ Yes! Please!

518
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:56,959
What makes you the Flamingo?

519
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:59,399
‐ Well, I'm sassy.
‐ Okay.

520
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:05,165
The flamingos are a symbol
of very luxurious vacations.

521
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:09,507
So I, my friends,
are your escape.

522
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:11,875
Yass, queen.

523
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:13,584
I see the wheels turning
over there

524
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:15,305
in Robin Thicke's mind.

525
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:17,981
Yes, yes, that‐‐
I think she just gave a clue.

526
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,820
‐ But I need a second to go through
my research here. ‐ God, Robin!

527
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:20,715
Wait, wait, wait. What's the clue?
What's the clue?

528
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:22,046
- ‐ Escape.
- Yes!

529
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:24,261
‐
‐ Escape?

530
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:27,293
‐ Ooh. ‐ Yes. One of the
girls from Xscape, I think.

531
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,959
What's the girl‐‐ she wrote hit
songs for other artists, too.

532
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:33,269
She's very, very talented.
She has a reality TV show also.

533
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:36,137
That's it, it's Kandi Burruss.
Kandi Burruss.

534
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,601
- ‐ Are you saying Kandi?
- Kandi, yes.

535
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,770
That's interesting.
Height‐wise‐‐

536
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,409
Maybe. I'm just
throwing it out there.

537
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:44,744
I also thought maybe
just from her attitude,

538
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:47,750
it reminded me of Tia Mowry
from "Sister, Sister."

539
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:50,123
No! She
wanted to escape from that.

540
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:52,282
She's got that same sass I've seen on
the reel. You know what I'm saying?

541
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:55,321
Okay. We don't know
what you're saying.

542
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,417
This game is hard, man.

543
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:02,590
Harder than last year.
And last year was difficult.

544
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:04,601
Well, hey, at least you guys
got something.

545
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,073
Ladies and gentlemen
one more time

546
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:09,971
for the amazing performance
from the Flamingo.

547
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,795
<i>Our panel thought</i>

552
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:20,407
This is so
out of character for me.

553
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:23,419
They actually thought
I was a professional singer.

554
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:26,022
I'm in shock and awe, people.
Shock and awe.

Welcome back
to "The Masked Singer,"

558
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:40,525
where you never know which
famous faces you're gonna see.

559
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,669
In fact,
in our audience tonight

560
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,444
are three of the shining stars

561
00:26:44,503 --> 00:26:47,513
of the new FOX drama
"Almost Family."

562
00:26:47,573 --> 00:26:49,013
Ladies and gentlemen, make
some noise for Brittany Snow,

563
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:52,784
Megalyn Echikumwoke,
and Emily Osment.

564
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:55,675
Thank you for joining us.

565
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:57,277
And guesses so far?

566
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,349
I'm thinking
it's Dolly Parton, for sure.

567
00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:02,748
The Flamingo is Dolly Parton?

568
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:04,221
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, totally.

569
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,989
Dolly Parton swagging
like that?

570
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:07,858
Yeah.
I love her YouTube show.

571
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:11,126
Dolly's "ma‐chest‐ical."

572
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:12,996
All right.
Remember, everybody,

573
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:14,825
"Almost Family"
premieres tonight

574
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,200
after "The Masked Singer"

575
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:18,198
‐ right here on Fox.
‐ All right!

576
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,210
But now, we're
smack dab in the middle

577
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:22,712
of a very dramatic face‐off.

578
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:26,614
It's time to grin and bear
some very cute clues

579
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:28,178
about the Panda.

580
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,390
‐ Aww!
‐ Her dad, big influence.

581
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,899
So it's gotta be some symbol
in banging your chest.

582
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:52,268
An athlete, possibly.

583
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:00,681
Famous family in the forest.

584
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:12,120
‐ Match, tennis.
‐ It could be a tennis star.

585
00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:22,665
And cooking. "Cookin' Like
Mama." So mama might be a cook.

586
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:33,382
So cute.

587
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:35,745
‐ Do you have any guesses after that?
‐ Laila Ali.

588
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:39,084
No way. Her body
type is way different.

589
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:41,721
‐ Maybe not, maybe not.
‐ All right.

00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:06,505
Man, Panda,
that was amazing.

616
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:09,511
Dr. Ken,
talk to the Panda, please.

617
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:12,014
Amazing performance.
Really, you just‐‐

618
00:30:12,077 --> 00:30:14,307
you just captured the stage.

619
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:17,819
And there's just obviously
something so likeable about you,

620
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:19,523
so charismatic,
and honestly,

621
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,424
you're, to me, the sentimental
favorite of the show.

622
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,086
Aww.

623
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:26,756
All right, panel, are you
picking up on any clues

624
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,925
from the performance
or the package?

625
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:32,064
Putting up everything with you
having a supportive family,

626
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:35,270
and sounds like you were
already successful on your own.

627
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,744
Maybe a celebrity cook,
a celebrity chef.

628
00:30:37,803 --> 00:30:40,213
Maybe, and you guys are gonna laugh
at me and I'm gonna ignore it.

629
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:43,312
‐ We will. ‐ You know,
maybe a Martha Stewart type.

630
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,280
She does hang with Snoop Dogg
now, so there is some edge to her.

631
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:50,076
She does hang with Snoop
Dogg, Nick, you know?

632
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:52,478
That doesn't mean
she's as tall as Snoop Dogg.

633
00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:54,621
She's three times the size of Nick?
I don't think so.

634
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,756
Well, everybody's three times
the size of Nick.

635
00:30:56,822 --> 00:30:57,862
He's the shortest host
in TV history.

636
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:02,555
He's 5'1"!

637
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:06,027
- Miss Scherzinger.
- I mean, Nick,

638
00:31:06,098 --> 00:31:08,868
they threw in "match"
and talking about their father

639
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:10,604
being a strong influence
in guiding them,

640
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:12,739
so I was thinking
maybe Venus Williams

641
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,874
only because she talked
she talked about Papa Bear.

642
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,410
Nice. I don't hate that answer.
I actually like it.

643
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:20,106
But these are the clues
that really stood out for me.

644
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:23,718
Strength, fighting,
match, winning.

645
00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:25,752
So definitely an athlete,

646
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:29,587
so I immediately went to,
like, wrestling, MMA.

647
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:32,164
Maybe Ronda Rousey.

648
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:34,134
Well, Ronda Rousey
doesn't look like that.

649
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:36,432
How do you know?
She's dressed as a panda.

650
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:38,425
If it's Ronda Rousey,
she's gonna beat your butt, Ken.

651
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:41,497
You know, I'm sorry.
Ronda, if it's true, I'm sorry.

652
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,166
Well, let's hear from
the Panda directly, shall we?

653
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:48,537
What makes you the Panda?

654
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:51,307
I'm loveable, but fierce.

655
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:54,006
Aww.

656
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,949
Look, everyone knows
I'm the king of wrong guesses,

657
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:59,015
so I deserve a second chance.

658
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,124
Now that I've processed
everything,

659
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:02,445
takes me a little longer‐‐

660
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:05,121
just hearing your voice,
loveable, but fierce.

661
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,390
Something Queen Latifah‐ish
about her?

662
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:10,129
No. No.
Thank you Thank you. I won.

663
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:12,495
‐ It's not Queen Latifah.
‐ I think it's Queen Latifah.

664
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:15,334
‐ Queen Latifah can sing. ‐ That's right.
Queen Latifah knows how to sing.

665
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:21,671
- ‐ You can sing, too, Panda.
- Stay with my logic.

666
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:25,280
‐ Queen Latifah, amazing‐‐
‐ The Panda can sing, too.

667
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:29,283
It's Queen Latifah, who we know can
sing better than that, but she's shy!

668
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:31,547
No! ‐ So you
think she's tricking us.

669
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,286
Queen Latifah's gonna kick
your butt, too, let me tell you.

670
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:37,322
Well, one thing we do know,
that was an amazing performance.

671
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:39,959
Ladies and gentlemen,
one more time for the Panda.

672
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:43,525
You did a great job,
Latifah. Love you.

673
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:44,925
<i>Our panel thought</i>
<i>one of these celebrities</i>

674

to decide who they want
to see sing again.

678
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,010
Who will live to sing
another day,

679
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:04,219
and who will join Leopard
in the smackdown

680
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:08,492
for one last chance
to keep their mask on?

681
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:11,663

691
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:40,453
Go back to your trailer
and gloat, madam.

692
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:45,189
Panda, you're going
to smackdown with the Leopard

693
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:47,957
to decide if you take it off
or keep it on.

694
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,786
‐ That's right, Panda!
‐ Come on, Panda!

695
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,231
But for now,
we're gonna see you later.

696
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:53,527
Keep it going for the Panda.

697
00:33:57,002 --> 00:34:00,112
If the TV was on and I was
cleaning the living room

698
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:01,171
and I heard that voice,
I'd be like,

699
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:02,609
"Yeah, it's so and so."

700
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:04,214
But for some reason
in the Panda costume,

701
00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:05,606
it's throwing me.

702
00:34:05,677 --> 00:34:06,947
It's driving me nuts.

<i>♪ Who is that? ♪</i>

704

Welcome back
to "The Masked Singer."

705
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:20,785
The two singers in jeopardy,
the Panda and the Leopard,

706
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:23,399
now get a second chance
to stay in the competition

00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:24,901
in the smackdown.

708
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:29,468
They both sing,
our panel votes,

709
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:32,804
one moves on,
and the other will be unmasked

710
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:34,271
right before our eyes.

711
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:36,309
Whoo!

712
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:43,617
This is the smackdown‐down!

713
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:50,791
In this mouth,
straight outta China,

714
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:55,025
and all pumped up on bamboo,
the Panda.

715
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:01,131
‐ Come on, Panda!
‐ Go, Panda!

716
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:04,397
Panda's so sweet.

717

Panda! Panda!

718
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:08,841
And in this mouth,
ready to pounce,

719
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:11,137
the Leopard.

720
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,750
Yes, Leopard!

Leopard! Leopard! Leopard!

00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:27,659
All right, you two animals
know the rules.

723
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:32,826
We want a good, clean fight.
Panda, you're up first.

I'm gonna really be sad

759
00:37:23,141 --> 00:37:24,111
to see either one
of you guys go

760

'cause there's
so much personality,

761

and you both have such
loveable outfits and personas.

and to come
on a stage like this

764
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:35,624
‐ and "bear" your all...
‐ Get out, seriously.

There it is.

766
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:40,233
What a confidence boost
this must be for you

767

to even overcome this obstacle,

768
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:44,657

Great job.

769
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:49,597
Okay, panel, enough talk.
Time to vote.

770
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:52,595
This is hard.

771
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,040
All right,
who will win the smackdown

772
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,365
and keep wearing
a sweat‐drenched costume

773
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,981
while lying
to their friends and family?

774
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:02,883
And what secret celebrity
is going home unmasked tonight?

775
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:05,852
We'll find out
after the break.

776
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,927
The time has come for
our masked moment of truth.

777
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:20,874
And the winner
of this smackdown is...

778
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:26,643
The Leopard!

779
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:28,274
‐ <i>♪ Free your mind ♪</i>
‐ Nicole: Wow.

780
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:30,979
‐ <i>♪ And the rest will follow ♪</i>
‐ Panda looks so sad.

781
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:33,382
- ‐ All right, Leopard.
- Congratulations.

782
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:36,614
You can keep it on
and head back to the lair.

783
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:37,951
<i>♪ Free your mind ♪</i>

784
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:40,616
<i>♪ And the rest will follow ♪</i>

785
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:43,855
‐ <i>♪ Be colorblind ♪</i>
‐ Just got kissed by a leopard.

786
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:46,662
Could it be someone tall
like RuPaul?

787
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:48,864
RuPaul's a pretty good guess.
‐ That's a good guess.

788
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:52,027
That means, Panda,
I'm sorry,

789
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:53,926
but you're leaving us.

790
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,898
Aww.
‐ I feel bad for Panda.

791
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:58,667
But we can't wait to see
your famous face!

792
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:01,206
‐ Keep it going for Panda.
‐ Aww, the Panda.

793
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:04,642
- ‐ Panda! Panda!
- Panel,

794
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:08,179
it's time for you guys
to give us some final guesses.

795
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:10,646
I have never been
more confused on this show

796
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:12,445
than right now with Panda.

797
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:15,387
I've gone from Ronda Rousey,
because of the athlete,

798
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:19,463
all the way to Wanda Sykes,
being like a comedian,

799
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:22,494
'cause you make me laugh and you've
got a lot of attitude and sass.

800
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,000
So I'm so lost, but if I'm
gonna throw it out there,

801
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:29,434
I'm just gonna say
Wanda Sykes.

802
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,200
No. That's an amazing
wrong guess.

803
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:35,841
I am going to double down

804
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:38,407
and say this is Queen Latifah

805
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:41,846
because she is likeable.

806
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:44,783
Hear me out, guys!
Stay with me.

807
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,579
Not known for singing,

808
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:49,591
but can sing,
but did disguise her voice.

809
00:39:49,654 --> 00:39:52,194
‐ She is known for singing. ‐ Had a
supportive‐‐ I know, but she's disguising it.

810
00:39:52,257 --> 00:39:56,087
She can't sing as well.
Just love my logic,

811
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,730
if not my choices!

812
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:02,327
I got an idea.
So after watching the smackdown,

813
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,740
this has to be somebody
with a comedic background.

814
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:07,312
I think Loni Love
from Chelsea Handler's show.

815
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:09,242
‐ Yes.
‐ Also from "The Real."

816
00:40:09,307 --> 00:40:10,807
‐ I'm going Loni Love.
‐ That's a good one.

817
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,635
Ooh.
‐ Miss Scherzinger,

818
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,150
who do you think it is?

819
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:16,512
I think maybe they
come from a famous family.

820
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,481
And she said "match"
in the clue package,

821
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:23,519
so I am going with
Venus Williams.

822
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:25,158
We are all over the place.

823
00:40:25,223 --> 00:40:28,033
Okay, panel,
you've made your final guesses.

824
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,762
Now let's see if any of you
are right.

825
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:34,128
I'm ready to see my queen.

826
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:37,168
Show us who you are, Panda.

827
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:40,035
‐ Come on, Panda.
‐ Take it off!

828
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:44,844
Take it off! Take it off!

829
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:47,479
<i>♪ Who are you? ♪</i>

830
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:50,745
‐ Come on, Loni!
‐ <i>♪ Who, who, who, who? ♪</i>

831
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:54,045

832
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,988

<i>♪ You, you, are you? ♪</i>

834
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:03,325
I knew it!
I knew it!

835
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:08,834
Undefeated boxing champion
Laila Ali!

836
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,570
‐ I said that as a joke.
‐ No way!

837
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:14,165
- ‐ You said Laila.
- Author, TV star,

838
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:17,578
and of course,
daughter of the greatest boxer

839
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:20,582
of all time, Muhammad Ali.

840
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,575
I knew it was you.

841
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:24,517
I can't believe
you guys didn't guess.

842
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:26,482
‐ You didn't know!
‐ How did you know?

843
00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:31,021
When you were joking about
singing and she punched me...

844
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:32,589
- ‐ I was like, "Ooh!"
- Yeah!

845
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:35,887
‐ ‐ "That gotta be
Laila right there."

846
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,830
So what was it like
being the Panda?

847
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:41,926
My God, it was crazy.
Just the suit being hot,

848
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,770
just singing
through this mask.

849
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:45,535
It was, like, I feel like
you couldn't hear me.

850
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:47,913
So it was a lot of fun.
I've always loved to sing.

851
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:49,442
Always been shy with singing,

852
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,807
but it was fun to be able to
perform without anyone knowing.

853
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:54,146
As a joke,
I said your name,

854
00:41:54,212 --> 00:41:56,052
but the padding
on the outfit comple‐‐

855
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:58,824
I know your body type. I was like,
"That is not her body type."

856
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:00,653
‐ So it totally fooled me.
‐ Now it makes sense.

857
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:02,888
Athlete, family, winning.

858
00:42:02,954 --> 00:42:04,664
Nick, I think we can cut out
all that Queen Latifah‐‐

859
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:08,032
I only mentioned it once.
We can cut that out of the show.

860
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:10,432
I don't think
she's gonna know, guys.

861
00:42:10,495 --> 00:42:12,095
I will say
this is the first time

862
00:42:12,163 --> 00:42:14,573
I've ever lost
something like this.

863
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:15,432
Right. ‐ So my
heart‐‐ yeah, I was like‐‐

864
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,540
‐ She's undefeated!
‐ My gosh!

865
00:42:17,602 --> 00:42:20,272
She's an undefeated boxer!

866
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:21,808
It was very humbling,
but it's been fun.

867
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:24,283
Aww.
‐ You're amazing!

868
00:42:24,342 --> 00:42:26,042
We know you're
not used to losing,

869
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,080
but you're still
a winner in our eyes.

870

Ladies and gentlemen, one last
time performing for us right here,
