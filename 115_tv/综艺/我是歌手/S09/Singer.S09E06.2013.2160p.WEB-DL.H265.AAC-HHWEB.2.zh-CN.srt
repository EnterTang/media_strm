不  贱民  你确实臭气熏天
No, you do stink, peasant,

3
00:18:08,181 --> 00:18:09,766
但那比这味道更臭
but it's much worse than that.

4
00:18:09,767 --> 00:18:12,106
可能是我放在地上的羚羊屎
Oh, it could be the gazelle dung I've put on the floor.

5
00:18:12,107 --> 00:18:14,265
你为何这么做
Oh! Why on earth would you do that?

6
00:18:14,266 --> 00:18:17,265
-防止那些老鼠靠近我的食物  -老鼠
- Keeps the rats away from food. - Rats!

00:18:17,588 --> 00:18:20,211
也可能是那些墙  它们都是用粪便做得
Or, it could be the walls, they're made of manure,

9
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:21,786
恰逢上个月尼罗河淹过小屋
and the Nile flooded the hut last month,

10
00:18:21,787 --> 00:18:24,213
所以它们有点  怎么说  粘乎乎的吧
so they're still a bit, how shall I put it, sweaty.

11
00:18:24,454 --> 00:18:28,988
-我只能说我爱死这里了  -太好了
- I can tell I'm going to just love it here. - Great.

12
00:18:29,257 --> 00:18:31,905
同时  在宫殿这边  晚餐时间到了
Meanwhile, over at the palace, it's dinner time.

13
00:18:31,981 --> 00:18:34,041
拿着  贱民  尝尝这些
Here, peasant, try one of these.

14
00:18:34,042 --> 00:18:35,764
这是什么  法老
What is it, my Pharaoh?

15
00:18:35,765 --> 00:18:37,252

That's delicious.

00:18:39,716 --> 00:18:41,663
我今晚想早点睡了
I feel I'm going to grab an early night.

19
00:18:41,664 --> 00:18:46,171
我得在太阳出来前起床  这是当然的
I have to be up before the sun comes up. Well, obviously I do.

20
00:18:46,172 --> 00:18:48,710
毕竟我可是唤醒太阳的男人

我刚开了个玩笑

这才像话
That's more like it.

24
00:18:56,258 --> 00:18:57,719
你不会相信的
You won't believe this,

25
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,841
王宫床上舒适的枕头
the royal palace has got beds

竟是用石头做得
with comfy pillows made of stone.

27
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:06,792
而且上厕所时得坐在像椅子一样的东西上
And a sort of seat thing that you sit on to go to toilet.

00:19:06,793 --> 00:19:09,276
他们的脑子都进屎了吗
What will they think of next?

29
00:19:09,845 --> 00:19:12,344
再看看贱民家中的晚餐时间
And it's also dinner time in the peasant hut.

30
00:19:13,675 --> 00:19:16,561
不好意思  王后  我们这蚊子略多
Sorry, Your Majesty, we do get a lot of mosquitoes,

31
00:19:16,562 --> 00:19:18,610
因为这里靠近尼罗河下游段
that's the downside of living near the Nile.

32
00:19:18,611 --> 00:19:20,911
但好处是有尼罗河的灌溉
The plus side is that the Nile floods,

33
00:19:20,912 --> 00:19:23,128
所以这里土地很肥沃
so the soil here is very fertile.

34
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:26,011
当洪水泛滥时  我们农民就休耕几个月
And when it does flood, we farmers get a few months off

35
00:19:26,012 --> 00:19:29,382
去沙漠那边  为法老搬运两吨重的巨石
to go to the desert and drag around two-ton boulders for the Pharaoh.

36
00:19:29,383 --> 00:19:32,767
但至少那可以让你远离这些蚊子
Ow! Well, at least it gets you away from all these mosquitoes.

37
00:19:32,768 --> 00:19:34,959
也离那些致命的蝎子更近了
And nearer the deadly scorpions!

38
00:19:36,307 --> 00:19:37,222
你不想要洋葱吗
Do you not want your onion? 

39
00:19:37,223 --> 00:19:38,629
-不许看着我  -不好意思
- Don't look at me. - Sorry.

40
00:19:39,353 --> 00:19:41,467
你一定不会相信我在哪睡
You're not going to believe where I had to sleep.

41
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:44,018
地上铺些稻草就是床  你没听错
On some straw on the floor. Yes, that's right.

42
00:19:44,019 --> 00:19:46,189
和这些羚羊屎一起睡在地上
On the floor with all the gazelle poop.

43

-是什么  -喂喂
