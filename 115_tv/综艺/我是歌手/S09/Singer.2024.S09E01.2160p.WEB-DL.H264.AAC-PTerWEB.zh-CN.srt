We are an equal opportunity

we welcome them

52
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,592
But we are very selective

53
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,688
when it comes to
our celebrity detectives.

54
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,030

00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:08,922
‐ Yes! ‐ All right,
well, let's get to it.

64
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:10,789
Tonight, the last new group

65
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,757
of celebrity singers
will face off

66
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,796
‐ two‐by‐two.
‐ Yes!

67
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,101
After each face‐off,
the studio audience and panel

68
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:20,525
will vote for their
favorite performance,

69
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,240
and the winner will get
to sing another day.

70
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:26,213
‐ Whoo!
‐ The loser of each face‐off

71

will perform again
in the smackdown.

72
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:31,808
The panel will then decide
who they want to see again,

73
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,078
and the loser will be unmasked
and sent packing.

74
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:40,518
Tonight, we've got the Flower
versus the Eagle,

75

All right, who's ready for
the first clues of the night?

101
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,065
Give it up for the Flower.

102

What's up, rosebuds?

103
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:09,606
Some say I blossom in every
field I plant myself in,

104
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:13,646
so becoming the Flower
was a natural arrangement.

105
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:16,483
I dipped my petals
in just about everything,

106
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,850
from cooking to clothing
to craft.

107
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,820
Cooking, crafts, clothing.

108

Martha Stewart,

everything to the nines.

00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,156
I don't even go

without lipstick
or pumps on.

112
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:35,674

this empire with my bare hands...

00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:52,167
- ‐ Flower! Flower!
- I think I might be

157
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,168
a little nervous,
I'm just saying.

158
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,810
I'm a little starstruck
with all that voice

159
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,375
- ‐ coming out of the Flower.
- Yeah.

160
00:07:57,444 --> 00:08:00,784
Jenny, you're‐‐
you're speechless.

161
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,847
I am so speechless,
but I just want to say

162
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,087
I am so incredibly blown away

163
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,622
by your beautiful,
soulful voice.

164
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:09,988
It's just magical.

165
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:13,126
‐ Amazing job.
‐ Wow.

166
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:16,203
This is my favorite genre
of music‐‐ heavy petal.

167
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,870
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you so much, Ken.

168
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:24,137
Like, seriously,
that voice is so legendary,

169
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:25,474
as you referred to yourself.

170
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,868
It was such
a classic performance.

171
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:32,081
I don't even know how you could
hit those notes with all of that.

172
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,475
Hey, Ruth Bader Ginsburg

173
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:36,076
can do what she wants,
all right?

174
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:38,649
‐ That's all I'm saying.
‐ All right, panel,

175
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,048
are you picking up
on any clues

176
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,860
from the performance
or the package?

177
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:43,261
Okay, so what I got out
of the clues

178
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:45,763
was clothing, crafts, cooking,

179
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,455
and then "empire."

180
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,027
That really stuck out for me.

181
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,295
So of course,
I thought immediately

182
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,703
Taraji P. Henson from "Empire."

183
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:56,297
You don't
think she can sing like that?

184
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,269
Not up there. ‐ I agree.
I don't think it's an actress.

185
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:03,239
Just going off of the clue package
at first, "vision of love,"

186
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,979
so I thought
of Mariah Carey, um‐‐

187
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,524
Why do you think we've been
holding hands the whole time?

188
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:16,624
♪ Reunited and it feels
so good ♪

189
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,259
So, obviously,
it's not Mariah.

190
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:22,964
No. ‐ So then after
I heard the performance,

191
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:27,029
I knew it was someone
extremely soulful,

192
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,700
has a wicked,
a stratospheric range.

193
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,269
I thought I heard Patti
LaBelle's voice in there.

194
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:34,268
You know what?
You know what?

195
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,110
You might be right, 'cause
when I was listening to it,

196
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:37,436
at the beginning
of the performance,

197
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,110
I had an handful of names
that I thought it could be

198
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:40,949
in the lower register.

199
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,454
But once she got to the end

200
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,215
and she hit those big notes,
hit those high notes,

201
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:47,494
there's only a few people
in the world of popular music

202
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:51,324
that I think could even hit those notes.
It's Jennifer Hudson.

203
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,161
‐ And then maybe Jessie J. from
the younger‐‐ ‐ Jenny: Jessie J.

204
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:54,826
You know,
from a younger generation.

205
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,364
Good guess.
She can hit those notes.

206
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,429
‐ She can hit those notes.
‐ That's a good guess, too.

207
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,327
‐ She can.
‐ That's an amazing wrong guess.

208
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,439
With a voice like that
and a flower outfit like that,

209
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:06,512
I'm going with Bjork.

210
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:08,983
You are Bjork!

211
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:10,142
You are Bjork.

212
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,310
Bjork wears flowers.
I get it.

213
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:16,278
Tweet it and hashtag it.
Ken says Bjork.

214
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,889
- ‐ It's so obvious!
- All right, panel,

215
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,352
it's definitely
question time.

216
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:25,430
Miss Flower,
what makes you the Flower?

217
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,032
That's right.
‐ She does, she does.

218
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:35,098
‐ Did that help you guys at all?
‐ Yes! You're a legend, Bjork.

219
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:39,067
‐ No one?
‐ No.

220
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,439
All right, that was
an amazing performance.

221
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:44,238
Keep it going one more time
for the Flower.

222

Well,

226
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,620
I never looked at the judges
because I was so nervous

when I was singing.

228

00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,225
when I saw everyone standing up,

230

I just felt so special.

231
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,527
She could still hit
those notes in that mask.

00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:38,043
‐ Where are you going?
‐ Be careful.

311
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,774
It seemed like you were kind of
throwing your talking voice

312
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,010
‐ by singing in an operatic tone.
‐ Right?

313
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:47,106
And when he had a chance at the end
to do something with the last note,

314
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,150
he went...

315
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:50,645
‐ ♪ No ♪
‐ Nicole: No, he didn't.

316
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:53,146
No, he didn't.
He did a slight crescendo.

317
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:56,189
He started out sotto voce, and
then he did a slight crescendo,

318
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:57,815
which added
a little bravado.

319
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,130
Listen to the singers.

320
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:03,834
Nicole, and clues that
you were picking up on

321
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,096
from this
vibrant personality?

322
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:09,135
Yeah, there was, like,
there was an older television

323
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:11,372
at the beginning of the package,
so it made me think

324
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:16,307
that it's somebody
a little bit more mature.

325
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:21,145
‐ No! ‐ Whoever it is,
they are hilarious.

326
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:23,384
I went off of the red bandana.

327
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:24,719
I mean, it might be
too obvious,

328
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,794
but I was thinking
who wears red bandanas?

329
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:30,493
Bret Michaels from Poison
is always rocking.

330
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,486
Bret Michaels,
not a bad idea.

331
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,828
You know, there was the health
scare, there's loss of parent,

332
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:37,564
and also, you know,
a rock star personality.

333
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,100
But I'm thinking Pauly Shore.

334
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,736
Pauly recently
lost his mother, so...

335
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:44,842
True. That's a good guess.

336
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:48,214
I'm getting some radio vibes
here because that clue of

337
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:50,014
listens to people's stories,

338
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:51,506
"now it's time to tell mine,"

339
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:54,047
makes me feel like
you've interviewed people.

340
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:57,123
‐ Yeah. ‐ And I kinda thought you
had the legs of Howard Stern

341
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,393
Yeah,
that's what I was thinking.

342
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:01,492
All right.

343
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:02,994
I was thinking that.

344
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:06,585
Or I was gonna say Adam Carolla
was the other radio DJ.

345
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,359
That's not a bad guess.

346
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:11,757
Ken, you look like
you have something to say.

347
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:13,931
I think you guys
are all wrong.

348
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,230
You do interview people
for a living.

349
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:16,741
You do listen to people.

350
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:18,442
You're very funny.
You're very witty.

351
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:22,044
I've been on your show. It sounds
like you're Craig Ferguson.

352
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:24,608
And Craig wears
jackets like this.

353
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:27,107
‐ He kind of walks around. He struts
like an eagle. ‐ Craig Ferguson?

354
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,749
‐ You're so wrong.
‐ Dude, I'm so smart!

355
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:34,946
Eagle,
what makes you the Eagle?

356
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:38,821
Like an eagle,
I can see things miles away

357
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,591
that other people may not see.

358
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:44,725
‐ ‐ Did that
help you guys at all?

359
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,397
The voice helped
a little bit, yeah.

360
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,295
‐ It's not Pauly Shore.
‐ No, it's not Pauly Shore.

361
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:49,997
Definitely not
Pauly Shore.

362
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,969
One thing we do know, the Eagle
definitely took over this stage.

363
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,810
I can't control him.

364
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,976
The Eagle reminds me
a lot like my comedy.

365
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:00,045
He's trying too hard.

let's learn more about a bird

404
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:33,696
who only flies when it sings,
the Penguin.

405
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:40,143
Penguins are incredibly
expressive birds,

406
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:43,936
so it's in my DNA to strive
for my voice to be heard.

407
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:48,852
My whole life, I've been told
I'm not pretty enough,

408
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,224
not smart enough,
not funny enough.

00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:31,014
Yeah, great attitude.

465
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,106
Now, I definitely
was picking up on some clues.

466
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,649
Robin Thicke,
did you pick up on any?

467
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,975
The thing that I really picked up
on that might be a hidden clue

468
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:41,651
is Penguin, to me,
dances like Melissa McCarthy.

469
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,090
Have you ever seen
Melissa McCarthy dance?

470
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:47,186
It's my cousin, so, yeah.

471
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,629
I don't know. You know, I saw
the sign "not your secretary,"

472
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:54,296
so I was thinking maybe
Megan Mullally

473
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:57,536
plays a secretary on
"Will & Grace."

474
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,973
I agree with Nicole. ‐
Jenny: I think that's a good guess.

475
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:03,509
‐ Yeah. ‐ But the clues that I
heard that I was like, ""

476
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:06,105
Voice to be heard.
Not pretty, not funny.

477
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:09,478
Her career was over.
All those things kind of led me

478
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:12,118
to a, like, a Kathy Griffin.

479
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:14,794
You also marched,
kind of an activist.

480
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:19,793
‐ That's a good one. ‐ But then
I heard a tone in her voice

481
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:24,158
that made me go, God, for the second
season I'm gonna be saying this,

482
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:27,499
but it sounds like
Sherri Shepherd.

483
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:29,896
You know, knowing Sherri's
voice, I just don't‐‐

484
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,999
it didn't sound vocally like her
at all, you know what I mean?

485
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:33,911
‐ Well, to me it did.
‐ Yeah? Okay.

486
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:37,243
You said that last season and I said
that Sherri Shepherd would grab my butt.

487
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,509
‐ I did. Yes.
‐ Yep, you did.

488
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,207
And it was actually Ricki Lake
grabbing my butt.

489
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:42,179
That's right.

490
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:43,977
‐!

491
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:49,119
Well, let's hear from
the Penguin, shall we?

492
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:53,026
What makes you the Penguin?

493
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:55,362
Everything is not

494
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:57,027
as black and white

495
00:24:57,096 --> 00:25:00,026
as it seems.

496
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,229
Maybe someone
who's colorblind?

497
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:07,339
Did that help you at all?
‐ Not at all, Nick Cannon.

498
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:09,136
Nick, do you know
who it is?

499
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:11,478
I'm catching a vibe.
I'm catching a vibe.

500
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:13,653
That's all I'm saying.
Ladies and gentlemen,

501
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:16,322
one more time for the Penguin!

502
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:21,318
<i>Our panel thought</i>
<i>one of these celebrities</i>

503
00:25:21,387 --> 00:25:23,657

504

<i>Who do you think it is?</i>

505
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:28,031
Only Raven‐Symoné
grabs butt like that.

506
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:30,463
‐ Raven‐Sym‐‐ ‐ Raven‐Symoné's a
good‐‐ that's a good guess, too.

507
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,529
That's a good guess.

508
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,938
This experience is so crazy.
I feel so good.

509
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:40,312
I don't feel
any judgment at all.

510
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:45,942
I'm just by myself being who
I've always dreamt of being.

511
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:49,581
<i>Coming up, our final

00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:51,248

‐ Whoo!

537
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:52,538
Right now we're in the middle
of a very tense face‐off

538
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:56,621
between a high‐flying singer
and someone who's,

539
00:26:56,682 --> 00:26:58,652
gonna be foxy.

540
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,687
Let's make way for the Fox.

541
00:27:06,492 --> 00:27:09,632
Are you ready for your
bedtime story, little one?

542
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:11,955
Ooh, a fairy tale fox.

543
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,600
All right, here we go.

544
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:15,295
Chapter one.

545
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:16,937
Foxes are clever
and nocturnal,

546
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:20,142
and I've definitely done
my best work at night.

547
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:22,935
‐ "Best work at night." ‐ A
lot of singers sing at night.

548
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,638
I dabbled in many
different genres.

549
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:28,651
From "Doogie" to "Doubtfire,"
I've laughed with them all.

550
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:30,484
"Doogie" and "Doubtfire."
It could be that he worked

551
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:33,789
with Robin Williams
and Neil Patrick Harris.

552
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:37,122
Over the years,
I've lived two different lives.

553
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:39,989
There's my on‐air
superhero persona,

554
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:41,828
who lives to entertain,

555
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:43,834
and then there's the real me,

556
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:47,326
who I am when I'm at home.

557
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:50,239
‐ Who's an on‐air superhero?
‐ David Letterman.

558
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:53,512
But under this mask,
my two identities

559
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:54,672
can finally become one.

560
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,810
Wish me luck tonight,
little fox.

561
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,720
Look how he stands.
It's like a dancer's stance.

562
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:05,783

Wow, what a voice.

587
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:35,310
Fox! Fox! Fox!

588
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:37,084
Swagged out.

589
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:39,582
Giving us some soul up here.

590
00:29:39,645 --> 00:29:43,015
Nicole, tell the Fox
about his performance.

591
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,781
‐ He is a natural. He knows‐‐
‐ Don't you think he's got some

592
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,590
Tony Awards
on his shelf at home?

593
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:47,792
I don't know
if he has Tony Awards

594
00:29:47,853 --> 00:29:49,963
or he has some
platinum records as well.

595
00:29:50,022 --> 00:29:52,122
Because he can sing,
he's so cool,

596
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,590
and he was effortless
the whole time.

597
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,026
True indeed.

598
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:57,534
Mr. Robin Thicke,

599
00:29:57,596 --> 00:29:58,826
were you picking up
on any clues

600
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:00,967
from the performance
or the package?

601
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:03,073
He moved like
a professional performer.

602
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:05,335
Could be Broadway. He could
have been in a band before.

603
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:07,674
I didn't recognize
the voice right off enough

604
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:09,679
to think it was a solo singer.

605
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:11,841
But he could be more like
a band member

606
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,680
who knows how
to hit the beat,

607
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:15,475
knows how to land
at the right step.

608
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:18,317
I don't know. I mean, he seemed
like a solo performer to me.

609
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,493
‐ Yeah. ‐ You've got your voice.
You've got the talent.

610
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:23,722
You've got the "it" power,
so the clues that I took

611
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:25,359
that are really kinda going...

612
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:28,694
is the superhero on‐air,
working at night,

613
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,960
double life, very successful.

614
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:33,529
And then I kept thinking of,
like, who would that be?

615
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:36,198
Like, a Wesley Snipes
in "Blade."

616
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:37,698
I don't know
if he can sing though.

617
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,239
I don't know if his thighs
look like that.

618
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:42,044
Um, and then
I heard the voice,

619
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:43,877
and I was like
that's a Broadway.

620
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:45,882
That's like a Tony Award,

621
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:49,384
Leslie Odom, Jr.,
"Hamilton" voice, you know?

622
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:52,378
‐ No. It's not Leslie. ‐ You don't
think it's Leslie Odom, Jr.?

623
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:54,391
I don't think
that's Leslie's voice.

624
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:58,063
I was thinking someone from
the "Hamilton" cast possibly.

625
00:30:58,123 --> 00:31:00,063
Then I was thinking
with the superhero,

626
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:02,625
I was thinking Anthony Mackie
vibes from "Captain America."

627
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,064
That's a good guess,
and he's a superhero.

628
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,470
- ‐ People don't know he can sing.
- He did say also

629
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,102
two identities to become one,

630
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:12,938
so this could be
his hidden talent

631
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:15,314
that he's unleashing
upon us right now.

632
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,244
Yeah. That's a good point.

633
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:19,639
Ken, you look perplexed.

634
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,881
I mean...

635
00:31:22,948 --> 00:31:26,448
I'm really trying
to think right now.

636
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:28,618
You're a doctor, come on!

637
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:30,817
Shut up, Nick Cannon.
Let me think.

638
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,819
I think you are
an accomplished actor

639
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,691
who many people
don't know sings.

640
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:37,701
And I don't know if
you're in a superhero movie,

641
00:31:37,763 --> 00:31:40,373
but I know that if you're
the person who I think it is,

642
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:42,032
he may have been in
a "Fast and Furious" movie.

643
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,600
He may have been in a "Transformers"
movie that I was a part of.

644
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:47,339
I think you're Tyrese Gibson.
Great to see you again, Tyrese.

645
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:48,766
Welcome to "The Masked Singer."

646
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,010
- Tyrese.
- Tyrese.

647
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:52,336
Thank you, Nick.
The way your look‐‐

648
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:53,811
vote of confidence
really helped me out.

649
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:56,819
‐ That ain't Tyrese.
‐ Mr. Fox,

650
00:31:56,882 --> 00:31:58,852
you got us all guessing.

651
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,617
What makes you the Fox?

652
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:03,816
Well, I'm quick,

653
00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:06,219
I refuse to be caged in,

654
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:08,361
and I'm crafty.

655
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,297
- ‐ Man. I know who that is.
- Crafty?

656
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:11,932
‐ You do?
‐ Yes, I do.

657
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:13,497
‐ I think I got it.
‐ I got it, I got it.

658
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:15,865
‐ Did that help you at all?
‐ What? Crafty and caged in?

659
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,974
‐ That helps? ‐ It just all
start clicking for me.

660
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:20,336
Yeah, I mean, it doesn't
fit the clue package,

661
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:23,205
but I think it's Jamie Foxx.

662
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:24,975
I think it's Jamie Foxx.
You just sound like Jamie F‐‐

663
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,053
‐ We're not on the same page?
‐ No!

664
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:30,352
‐ I thought we were on the same page!
‐ No! Abandoning you.

665
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:32,845
It sounded a little like
Jamie's tone at some point.

666
00:32:32,918 --> 00:32:35,818
‐ Now I'm really confused. ‐ Well, one
thing we can definitely pick up on

667
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:37,487
is it was
an amazing performance.

668
00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:40,956
Ladies and gentlemen,
a skilled performer.

669
00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:43,656
‐ Who is the Fox? ‐ I have
no idea who this could be.

670
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:45,198
It's driving me crazy.

671

Welcome back
to "The Masked Singer."

700
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,460
Tonight, we've seen
the journey of an eagle,

701
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:19,722
a flower, a penguin,
and a fox.

702
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:23,631
But the Eagle or the Penguin
is about to learn

703
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:26,155
that not every fairy tale
has a happy ending,

704
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:28,331
because one of them
will be unmasked

705
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,800
at the end of the show.

706
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:31,298
How will that be decided?

707
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:37,476
This is the smackdown‐down!

708
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:39,012
Whoo!

709
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:43,923
‐ The smackdown, Ken!
‐ My cheek!

710
00:34:43,982 --> 00:34:45,152
My precious cheek!

711
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:46,986
‐ That's right.
‐ My other cheek!

712
00:34:47,052 --> 00:34:50,992
In this mouth,
a monogamous bird

713
00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:53,486
that can fly anywhere it wants

714
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:56,028
and not just Philadelphia,

715
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,434
the Eagle!

716
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:05,303
‐ Jay Mohr had a radio show.
‐ Jay Mohr is not a bad guess.

717
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,110
Right there. Over there.

718
00:35:07,172 --> 00:35:11,612
There you go.
And in this mouth,

719
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:14,446
a flightless bird that breeds

720
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:17,452
in large colonies
up to a thousand,

721
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:21,115
the Penguin!

722
00:35:21,186 --> 00:35:24,456
- ‐ Yeah! Yes, girl! Yes!
- Yes!

723

I hope you make it through.

771
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:35,987
My gosh!

772
00:37:36,054 --> 00:37:38,164
That penguin got happy feet.

773
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:39,993
We just went from
"March Of The Penguins"

774
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:41,658
to twerk of
the penguins up there.

775
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:44,996
- ‐ She was dropping it low.
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

776
00:37:45,063 --> 00:37:49,003
And, Eagle,
I'm completely thrown.

777
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:51,337
The first performance was
giving me, like, a rich tone.

778
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:55,342
And for some reason, I was like, "If
Jeff Goldblum was an eagle on this show,

779
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:56,776
maybe that would be him."

780
00:37:56,841 --> 00:38:00,411
But the tone changed a little,
so I don't know.

781
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:02,148
I'm here for both of you.
I'm here for both of you.

782
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:07,093
‐ Both birds. ‐ All right,
now, panel, enough talk.

783
00:38:07,152 --> 00:38:09,722
Time to vote.

784
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:10,758
Who will win this smackdown

785
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:12,962
and keep their
secret identity from us?

786
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:14,764
And who's heading home
to someplace

787
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:16,456
that's probably pretty sweet?

788
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:21,727
We'll find out
after the break.

789
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:35,375
The winner who gets
to keep it on is...

790
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:44,962
‐ ...the Penguin!
‐ Yes! Yes!

791
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:47,693
Congratulations, Penguin.
You're still in this thing.

792
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:50,829
Go ahead
and strut your stuff

793
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:54,525
back to the South Pole‐‐
wherever penguins live.

794
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:56,499
Penguin came for Eagle.

795
00:38:56,568 --> 00:38:58,838
She's a fighter, man.
She is a fighter.

796
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:01,143
‐ And she's funny.
‐ I get comedian, definitely.

797
00:39:01,206 --> 00:39:04,476
Eagle, we're sorry
you are going home.

798
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:09,712
But we are super excited
to see who you really are.

799
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:13,791
But first, panel, again,

800
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,522
any guesses
of whose famous face

801
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:17,957
is about to be revealed?

802
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,962
‐ This was a tough one for us.
‐ Yeah, tough one.

803
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,064
‐ I have no idea.
‐ I'm kind of just stuck

804
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,256
on the listening
to people's stories,

805
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:25,759
finally telling my own.

806
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:26,930
So that makes me think

807
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:29,498
of a talk show host,
a radio host.

808
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:30,537
I came up with Howard Stern.

809
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:31,772
Then the other side of me

810
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:33,366
said Adam Carolla.

811
00:39:33,438 --> 00:39:36,878
I am so lost, but if
I'm gonna throw it out there,

812
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:39,781
I'm just gonna say
Adam Carolla.

813
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:43,184
I agree. There's a few
things that stand out,

814
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:45,278
like the, you know,
had a recent health scare,

815
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,280
listen to people's stories,

816
00:39:46,351 --> 00:39:47,951
has a rock star type
of personality.

817
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:50,419
Howard Stern is definitely
one of those kind of people

818
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:52,518
and recently went through
a health scare.

819
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,130
And then I thought
Montel Williams,

820
00:39:55,193 --> 00:39:56,463
who is also a talk show host

821
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:58,457
who recently struggled
with MS.

822
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:00,899
But because of the height
and the rock star,

823
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:02,725
‐ I'm gonna go Howard Stern.
‐ Wow.

824
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:06,799
Ken, you look like
a mastermind.

825
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:08,141
You look like
an evil villain up there.

826
00:40:08,206 --> 00:40:11,306
He is.
‐ You know exactly who this is.

827
00:40:11,376 --> 00:40:12,806
It really‐‐ just trying to put
all the clues together,

828
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:14,277
obviously a talk show host

829
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:17,315
with a great stage presence,
great charisma.

830
00:40:17,382 --> 00:40:19,952
Someone who's really got
incredible comedic chops.

831
00:40:20,018 --> 00:40:24,458
I'm just gonna have to
double down on Craig Ferguson.

832
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:27,662
He's doubling down.
‐ On the Scottish man.

833
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:31,055
Why would a Scottish man
pick an American eagle?

834
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:35,199
Will you just shut
your hole, Robin?

835
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:39,196
Miss Scherzinger? ‐ I‐‐
first, going off of the obvious,

836
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,040
the red bandana
and the health scare

837
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,036
and the classic rock vibes,

838
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:47,008
I was thinking Bret Michaels
from Poison.

839
00:40:47,078 --> 00:40:51,378
‐ Rock on, Eagle. ‐ But then on the
smackdown, the tone changed a little.

840
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:55,689
‐ It did change. ‐ And I was
feeling Jeff Foxworthy.

841
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:58,023
- Which isn't bad.
- Not a bad guess.

842
00:40:58,089 --> 00:41:00,329
Studies show most people
in bandanas are named Jeff.

843
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:01,931
Nice.
‐ That's a medical fact.

844
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:04,463
‐ A medical fact from the doctor.
‐ Fact, guys. Fact.

845
00:41:04,529 --> 00:41:06,159
And, Eagle,
you're welcome to give

846
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,170
any of these guys the bird.

847
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:09,001
That's all. Just saying.

848
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:11,967
We needed one more pun.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

849
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:15,006
Okay, panel,
you've made your final guesses.

850
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:17,013
Now let's see
if any of you are right.

851
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:19,375
And I'm dying to know
who this is.

852
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:22,984
Eagle, show us
who you really are.

853
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:24,317
Take it off.
‐ Yes!

854
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:26,722
Take it off! Take it off!

855
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:30,054
‐ <i>♪ Who, who, who, who? ♪</i>
‐ Take it off! Take it off!

856
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:32,521
‐ <i>♪ Who are you? ♪</i>
‐ Who is it?

857
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:35,230
<i>♪ Who, who, who, who? ♪</i>

858
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:38,303
‐ Take it off, Eagle!
‐ <i>♪ Who? ♪</i>

859
00:41:38,363 --> 00:41:40,733
‐ <i>♪ I really want to know ♪</i>
‐ <i>♪ Who? ♪</i>

860
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:44,638
‐ My gosh! My gosh!
‐ <i>♪ Who are you, you, you? ♪</i>

861
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:46,272
<i>♪ Are you? ♪</i>

862
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:49,937
It's Dr. Drew!
‐ No way!

863
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:52,208
From "Loveline."
30 years, Jenny!

864
00:41:54,379 --> 00:41:56,449
From one doctor
to another doctor!

865
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:00,153
Didn't see that coming at all.

866
00:42:00,218 --> 00:42:02,548
I did not see
this coming at all.

867
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:06,720
‐ I was so close. I was so close.
‐ I know!

868
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:08,831
You've spent
a lot of your career

869
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:11,103
talking to rock stars,
helping them out.

870
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:13,462
How did it feel to finally
become a rock star on stage?

871
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:18,071
‐ Very bizarre.
‐ We're doctors, man.

872
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:21,236
Ken, how about you used to
fill in for me?

873
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:23,105
I filled in for you
on "Loveline."

874
00:42:23,174 --> 00:42:25,144
You did. ‐ But how about
Jenny getting Adam Carolla?

875
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,779
I know!
‐ You got so close.

876
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:28,654
How did I not‐‐ so close.

877
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:30,823
I actually thought
"Loveline," Adam Carolla.

878
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:33,552
I never thought Dr. Drew
as this rock and roll performer.

879
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,989
‐ There he is! Dr. Drew!
‐!

880
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,426
‐ You are so sexy, Drew.
‐ Yeah.

881
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:42,461
I'm serious.
You look amazing.

882
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:44,927
Well, you should have
put me through!

883
00:42:44,996 --> 00:42:46,356
I can't believe it.

884
00:42:46,431 --> 00:42:52,341
The artist formerly known
as the Eagle, Dr. Drew!

885
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:55,513
♪ I would do anything

886
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,683
