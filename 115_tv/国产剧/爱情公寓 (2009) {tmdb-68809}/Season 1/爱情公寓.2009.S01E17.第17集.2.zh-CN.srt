1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,970
Casey,be honest with me.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,380
Are my pregnancy hormones
making me seem bitchy?

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:10,070
What?!they're definitely
making you glow,that's for sure.

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:17,330
{\a6}<i>Lies: 0</i>

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,590
{\a6}<i>Lies: 1</i>

6
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,890
- Wait. Are you being evasive?
- Am i?

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,030
- Casey,am I acting bitchy or not?
- no.

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,460
What did you do?

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,870
It's a new recipe.I remember how excited
you were last time I cooked something fancy.

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,890
{\a6}<i>Lies: 0</i>

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:44,690
{\a6}<i>Lies: 1</i>

{\a6}<i>Lies: 3</i>

14
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,220
I was so excited.

15
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,990
So I made pork a l'orange.

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,570
It's supposed to be with duck,but
that sounded wrong to me.Taste it.

17
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,430
The flavors really just work.

18
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,560
- It's different,right?
- Yes!

19
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,060
This is the different-est
thing you've ever made.

20
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,870
So,you know,pork seems a little... Raw.

21
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,220
Are you,uh,sure you cooked
it to the right temperature?

22
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,860
Yeah. I know what
temperature to cook pork to.

23
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,790
Well,it's tuesday night,our
foolin' around night.

{\a6}<i>Lies:1</i>

{\a6}<i>Lies:6</i>

31
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:10,130
It sure is. I have been
looking forward to this all day.

32
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,870
But not as much as I have.

33
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,280
I like it when you do that.

34
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,280
Well... I know what I'm doing.

35
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,410
God,you're sexy.

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,150
I know.

37
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,190
- Did you just fall asleep?
- no.

41
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:01,560
my parents are coming by.They said they
wanted to give us our baby present early.

42
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,030
I bet it's that camera I've been
dropping hints about for weeks.

43
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,210
that would be awesome.

44
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,790
I really wanna document this special time in our
lives Your belly,the baby coming out,his new room.

45
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,490
- I'm sorry. What was that middle thing?
- The baby coming out?

46
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,550
Oh,yeah.I'm gonna take
video all up in there.

47
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:23,600
Yeah.No,no,no. You will not be doing
any filming south of the equator,okay?

48
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:27,360
You will be staying
up here at all times.

49
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:31,720
All right.Seems a little weird to
have somebody else film it,but okay.

50
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,630
joel and vicky.

51
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,720
Okay,we have brought
something for little victor.

52
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,470
Mom,I told you that don't normally
name a baby boy after his grandmother.

53
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,470
What if he comes out
looking just like me?

54
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,900
Yeah,then we got bigger fish.

55
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,150
Well,thanks for the present.Can't
wait to learn how to use it.

56
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,610
Learn how to use it?It's a book.

57
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,340
Honey,he's from vermont.

58
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,450
To him,a book is probably just something
you shove under an outhouse to keep it level.

59
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:08,590
"the little brown puppy."I loved this
book.I used to read it when I was a kid.

60
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,880
I haven't seen this in 20 years.

61
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:17,300
I remember the first book I ever read.Started
with a picture of a stereo all in pieces.

62
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,670
At the end,the stereo
was all put together.

63
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,740
Even though I knew it was coming,the
ending always surprised me.

64
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:30,040
Now this book has been
in our family for forever.

65
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:36,000
I used to read it as a child,and I am
giving it to my child to read to her child.

66
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:40,750
I love traditions like that,where
you don't have to buy anything new.

67
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,930
everyone.I have some news.

68
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,040
At the law firm today,I heard
some very exciting scuttlebuzz

69
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,340
Well,you didn't hear
scuttlebuzz,but go ahead.

70
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,090
What?

71
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,070
Well,I'm just saying "scuttlebuzz" isn't
a word.You might have heard buzz or ****

72
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,970
Are you seriously doing this when I'm about
to tell everyon i'm gonna be made a partner?

73
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,640
Oh,my god!Oh,my god.

74
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,470
That's the scuttlebuzz.

75
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,850
They're gonna be naming three new
partners at my firm,and boyd woznack,

76
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,720
who's on the voting committee,told
me I am gonna be one of them.

77
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,160
- That is great! Maddie,congratulations!
- Honey,we are so proud of you.

78
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,720
it's nice to see you bring
honor back to the putney name.

79
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:22,590
It reminds me of my early days as a money manager,before
what I like to call my... "financial missteps."

80
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,890
Back then,when people
said the word "putney,"

81
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,860
it wasn't immediately followed by "that
son of a bitch drained my savings. Get him!"

82
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:33,930
Oh,my god!That wasn't a
book.It was a stereo manual!

83
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,230
Wait. I don't understand.I'm
not being made partner?

84
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,040
I write more wills than any lawyer here.

85
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,160
I'm sorry,and ,And brace
yourself.It gets worse.

86
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:46,740
What?

87
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:52,060
Because of the economy,the firm is hemorrhang
money.We had to make some tough decisions,and,

88
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,070
We're letting you go.

89
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,610
But boyd woznack told me
I was gonna be partner.

90
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,960
Yeah. He's gone,too.

91
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,150
He was spreading too
much false scuttlebuzz.

92
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:11,090
I can't believe this.I've been here for eight
years.I've devoted my life to this company.

93
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:16,010
I don't know what to say.People just haven't
been dying as much as we need them to.

94
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:20,050
I know it's been slow,but people are gonna
start dying again,neil.I know they are.

95
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,050
I wish there were something I could do.

96
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:27,420
All these new medicines and technological
advances,and nobody smokes anymore.

97
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,750
It is killing us!

98
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,590
Well,but it'll pick up, A new
disease,tainted food,something.

99
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:37,030
How about a natural disaster?You're gonna
need people here if there's a natural disaster.

100
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:42,060
Well,look,um,a big earthquake hits new
york,you'll be the first one I call.

101
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,900
I mean,uh,after my family,ourse.

102
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,050
Can we just give it another week?These
things comes in bunches,neil.

103
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,750
When I was 12,my aunt,a kid
down the street,and my cat died.

104
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:54,220
- Deaths are coming,neil!I can feel it!
- We can only hope.

105
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,510
Check it out!

106
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,170
That book that your parents gave us, I thought
I'd look online,see if it's worth anything.

107
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,770
You are never gonna believe
how much it's going for.

108
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,890
- Guess how much.
- $1,000?

109
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,180
No.What do you always do that?

110
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:13,990
You always go super high,and then no
matter what I say,it won't be impressive.

111
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,550
Sorry,baby. Ask me again.

112
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,430
- Guess how much the book is worth.
- 50 cents?

113
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:23,650
No! $300! 50 cents.

114
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,530
And our copy's in great condition.

115
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,910
We should sell it and use the
money to get the cera we want.

116
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,970
no,we can't sell that book.It's been in my family
for generations.It's like an heirloom or whatever.

117
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,600
Okay.I totally
understand.We won't sell it.

118
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,020
No,no,wait. Don't give
up.Try to convince me.

119
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,390
Yeah,I want to sell the book.I
just didn't wanna feel bad about it.

120
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,690
it's okay.We'll just buy
the camera with ouown money.

121
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,900
All right,casey.You
win,okay?We'll sell the book.Jeez!

122
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,130
Whoa!Howdy,partner!

123
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,960
Get it? It's an old west phrase,but
here I'm using it to refer to your new

124
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,100
I got fired.

125
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,720
You got fired?!What? Why?

126
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,930
They downsized the
whole probate department.

127
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,720
They said people aren't
dying as much as they used to.

128
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,390
What?!Three people died in
my hotel just this past week.

129
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:25,260
Thank you!Anyway,it doesn't
matter because I turned it around.

130
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:29,650
I kept my job by telling them
I do not accept my firing.

131
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,690
Is that how that works?

132
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,210
Well,it worked today.

133
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,250
I appreciate everything you're
trying to do here,neil,with firing me,

134
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:42,100
but unfortunately,at this time,I just
can't accept it,and I do apologize for that.

135
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,090
- but
- Neil,I've thought long and hard about this.

136
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:48,010
I'm sorry,but my decision
is final.See you tomorrow.

137
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:54,140
I'm... Not sure that
means you still have a job.

138
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:58,900
No,I do. No,no.They were just testing
me to see how much I wanna be partner.

139
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,380
It doesn't sound like a test.

140
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:04,130
Well,to be fair,you're not very good
at knowing when you're being tested.

141
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:09,550
- Like... Like right now?
- yep.

142
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,690
- Did I fail again?
- yep.

143
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,860
- Anybody need a drink?
- Yeah.I'd love another glass.

144
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:22,450
That was a rhetorical question,junior.One
drink per person.This isn't maddie and ben's.

145
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,230
Here's the lady of the hour.

146
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,390
There's the new partner!

147
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,550
Mine were better.

148
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:34,940
How did it go today?

149
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,920
They escorted me out of
the office.It wasn't a test.

150
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,010
I know,baby.

151
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,890
I wish it was a test.I'm
really good at tests.

152
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,100
- You gonna tell your parents?
- No. I can't.They were so proud of me.

153
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,940
would kill me to see that look
of disappointment on their faces.

154
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,910
Well,yeah. You get used to that.

155
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,820
Hey,dinner,will eady in five minutes.Come
on,joel.Help me with the salad.

156
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,720
All right. So what's going on over here?

157
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,470
What's with all the whispering?

158
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,770
Is this aboucasey's shirt?

159
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,150
'cause it's not like ben
always wears the right thing.

160
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,800
Am I the only one who
remembers the beret?

161
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,440
They didn't make me
partner,mia.They fired me.

162
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,730
What?Oh,my god. I'm so sorry.

163
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,600
it's okay. I didn't accept it.

164
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,130
no.Is this like how you didn't
accept that b-minus in geometry?

165
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,280
That grade is still working its
way through the appeals process.

166
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,630
You can't tell mom and dad I got fired.

167
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:24,800
Aren't they gonna find out eventually?

168
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,310
No,no,because I have a plan.

169
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,020
I'm gonna call everyone I know and
e-mail my **** to every firm in the city.

170
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,030
I'll get a new job and tell mom and dad
I quit because I got a better position.

171
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,470
All right,so speaking of secret plans,we have
something that you cannot tell mom and dad.

172
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,160
Okay,you know that book that we read
as kids, "the little brown puppy"?

173
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,290
- I love that book.
- Yeah.

174
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:45,690
Well,we found out it's worth a lot of
money,and we are currently selling it online.

175
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:50,860
If you can't find a job and you need money,just
grab a couple books from here and sell 'em online.

176
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,400
I already hid two in
the back of my shirt,see?

177
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,810
{\a6}<i>Day 1 Without A Job</i>

178
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:58,440
I am so excited to go out
and tackle the world today.

179
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,050
I bet losing my job is gonna be the
best thing that ever happened to me.

180
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,980
{\a6}<i>Day 3 Without A Job</i>

181
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,420
I didn't find a job,and
a bird crapped on me.

182
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,900
I used to be a lawyer!

183
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,760
{\a6}<i>Day 8 Without A Job</i>

184
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,090
You know what I realized last
night at 4:30 in the morning

185
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:19,910
when I was cleaning the bathroom
again for no reason? It is all up here.

186
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,440
If you visualize yourself
getting a job,you will get one!

187
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,160
<i>Day 9 Without A Job</i>

188
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:30,130
- Hey,honey.
- Look,there aren't any jobs.

189
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,070
It's been over a week.

190
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,780
I've called everyone,e-mailed **** to
every firm in the city.No one's intted.

191
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:41,230
Apparently word got out that I didn't accept
my firing,and now I'm considered a "risky hire."

192
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,260
Well,o-okay,but we
can't give up,can we?

193
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,470
Don't start with that "we" crap,ben.

194
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,760
You don't know what it's like out there.You
have a job... If you wanna call it that.

195
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,900
say what you want about me,but
leave the hotel out of this.

196
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:58,250
I used to have everything,and
then just like that,gone.

197
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:02,220
- Have... You been watching tv all day?
- Yes.

198
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,810
There are a lot of great shows
on during the day.I had no idea.

199
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:08,160
Before,I saw this really
funny one about an acne cream.

200
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:11,140
Now I'm watching one about a
juicer.It's more of a drama.

201
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,430
All right.how about we
get you io the shower?

202
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,270
No. I'm good.I wanna see what happens when
they put the whole apple in the juice machine.

203
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,110
It's gonna clog for sure.

204
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,280
- Ben coles.
- It didn't! It didn't clog!

205
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:28,480
It's for you. It's a law firm.Freeman
and gant? I've heard of them.

206
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:33,220
Oh,my god. This is maddie putney.

207
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,610
An interview? Now?

208
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,300
I can't come right now.I've been
drinking,and I'm covered in cheese balls.

209
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,660
You don't have to say
that.They can't see you.

210
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,520
You can't see me.I'll come right over.

211
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,070
Oh,my god.You missed it!

212
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,660
Today was the last day of the auction.

213
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,890
There was a bidding war
- People who are desperate for this book,

214
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,870
- Really?
- I know,I know.It's crazy.

215
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,550
The winner's coming
by to pick up the book.

216
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,520
- Guess how much it sold for.
- $1,000?

217
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:05,600
Damn it! No! $350.

218
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,670
Really? Still,that's crazy.I mean,it's just
a sweet little book about a dog.I had no idea.

219
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,920
This book must be amazing.

220
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:18,220
"'little brown puppy' by scooter
mcgill." Pretty good so far.

221
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:25,060
"the little brown puppy was always causing trouble.
He wasn't allowed to mix with the good white dogs."

222
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:37,280
Is it just me,or is
this book crazy racist?

223
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:43,120
What? No,it's a book
about puppies that, Whoa.

224
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,370
Oh,my god.Yeah. This is horrible.

225
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,360
Shame on you,scooter mcgill!

226
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,600
I had no idea!

227
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:58,710
It's like the first time you realize
the california raisins used to be grapes.

228
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,230
I cannot believe that my
parents let me read this book.

229
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,550
I was an impressionable child.

230
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,380
Do you think this book shaped
me and I didn't even know it?

231
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,960
Is this why I don't like "the wire"?

232
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:14,780
Who are all the people who
wanted to buy this book?

233
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,320
What kind of monster
is coming over here?!

234
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,080
Stereo manual doesn't
look so bad now,does it?

235
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,050
so your *** is very impressive

236
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,550
What would you say is
your biggest weakness?

237
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,800
Great question,miles.

238
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:40,290
My biggest weakness is probably
that I don't have a weakness.

239
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,440
Okay. A little hard
to believe,but...Okay.

240
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,140
How much experience do you have
in other aspects of the law?

241
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,830
Well,my specialty is probate,but I've always been
interested in family law,contract law,litigation.

242
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,270
I can do anything.The law is my life.

243
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,220
- I have a t-shirt that
says that. - I like that.

244
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,130
Really? You can have it. It's yours.

245
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,440
No. That's gross.

246
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:02,580
I'll get you a new one. You don't want
a shirt with my old sweat stains on it.

247
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:07,520
Unless you do,then that's weird,but fine.My
boyfriend put on my bra once.I don't judge.

248
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,050
Maybe your weakness is you
don't know when to stop talking.

249
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:14,940
Well,I wouldn't call collecting women's
sweat-stained shirts a strength,miles.

250
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:20,900
I like you. Why don't you come in tomorrow
morning,9:00 a.m.? We'll discuss salary then.

251
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,190
I got the job? Oh,my god! Thank you.

252
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,710
I knew this would happen.I visualized it in
my head while I cried in front of the mirror.

253
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,600
But everyone's cried in front
of the mirror,right,miles?

254
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,910
Stop talking.Okay.

255
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,770
It's the racists.

256
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,200
Oh,no. It's just my mom and dad.

257
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,740
Well...

258
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:47,340
Okay,we broke down and got you the
camera,so you can stop hinting all the time.

259
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:52,730
okay.Well,it's a little banged up,and...There
are pictures of strangers on here.

260
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:55,750
Yes,it is the floor
model,but it still works.

261
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,360
Please,I don't see why floor
models get such a bad rap.

262
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,410
So a bunch of weird people touched it.

263
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,880
Didn't stop me from
marrying your mother.

264
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,420
Okay,good,well,I'm glad you guys are here,because you
know that children's book that you gave me last week?

265
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:15,900
- It's really racist.
- No,it's not.It is a book about puppies.

266
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,860
- Puppies can't be racist.
- I don't know about that.

267
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:24,910
Growing up,I had a dog,and anytime
an eskimo came by,oh!good luck,buddy.

268
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,200
Look,mom.

269
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,220
Oh,my.

270
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:38,000
Okay,you're right.This book is terrible.
Why did my mother let me read that?

271
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,560
Is this book the reason I
didn't like "sanford and son"?

272
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,300
Okay,well,don't worry.We're getting
rid of it.We put it up for sale online.

273
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,640
Someone's coming to
pick it up right now.

274
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,440
- What?You can't sell that.
- Why?

275
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,350
Because it's been in our
family for generations?

276
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:55,190
Look,you can't rid of something just
because it's offensive and old-fashioned.

277
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:59,550
I still keep your mom around.Come
on!You gotta give it to me for that one!

278
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,150
sorry,vicky,but he nailed that.

279
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,310
Oh,my god.It's the racists.

280
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,900
I'm here for the book.

281
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,360
Not what I was expecting.

282
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:25,410
sweetie.You know what? You're
pretty.You don't need to read.

283
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,780
Sorry. I was paying
the cabbie.I'm francine.

284
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:33,000
This is my daughter katie,and we're
here to buy "the little brown puppy."

285
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,740
come on in.

286
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:38,110
So can I ask you why you want this book?

287
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,730
well,I read it when I was a little
girl,and I want my daughter to read it now.

288
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,230
yeah.Have you read it recently?

289
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,320
not in-gosh-25
years.

290
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,400
francine,uh,first of all,you should know
that I was in the same place you are.

291
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:56,810
I read this book as a kid,and I thought it was
great,but I read it today for the first since then,and,

292
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,080
It's really racist.

293
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,760
- no,it's not.
- It is.

294
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:09,320
Oh,my god. Oh,this is disgusting.

295
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,910
Why would my parents let me read this?

296
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:14,710
Is this why I didn't like urkel?

297
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,170
no.

298
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:24,180
Well,what are we gonna do with it now? Can't
sell it,can't read it,can't give it away.

299
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,920
We could send it to casey's
family to prop up their outhouse.

300
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:33,500
Right,'cause my family's the one
who comes out of this looking bad.

301
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:40,190
Hey,guys.I have big
news.I left my law firm.

302
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:44,140
- I thought they made you a partner.
- No,that turned out not to be true.

303
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:49,720
So I left,head held high,dignity intact,and
just got a different,even better position.

304
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:52,270
- Where?
- At a firm called freeman and gant.

305
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,650
- The bus bench people?
- What?

306
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,220
Freeman and gant-they have ads
on all the bus stop benches.

307
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:00,350
"Call freeman and gant if
you get in an accidant."

308
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:06,100
- they're ambulance chasers?
- Of course!That's how I knew them.

309
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,950
You couldn't remember
that before my interview?

310
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:13,190
Well,to be fair,I was getting cheese ball
powder off you with a keyboard vacuum.

311
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,240
Okay,I'm confused.Why would you leave a great
firm like braverman to work for those people?

312
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,670
I was let go from my old job.

313
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:25,470
They downsized the probate group,and freeman
and gant was the only firm willing to hire me.

314
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:32,580
Why didn't you tell us? We had that whole
dinner. We even sprung for a side salad.

315
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,430
I didn't want to disappoint
you. You were so proud of me.

316
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,890
I mean,I'm the daughter who's
a success in the business world.

317
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,170
On my own company.

318
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,840
Hey,you could never disappoint us.

319
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:51,260
We're proud of you because of who
are,not because of what job you have.

320
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:57,440
You turned into a wonderful person,even
though we gave you racist books to read.

321
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,070
Look,and I don't care where you work.

322
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,060
Wherever it is,I'm sure you
will be the best lawyer there.

323
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,530
So what if it's not the perfect job?

324
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,440
You work there for a few months
while you try to find a better one.

325
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:09,890
No,you're right!No one will
ever know I worked there.

326
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,760
Look,casey,an online relationship quiz.

327
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,220
"how well do you know your mate?"

328
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,000
okay,"where was your mate
born?" that's easy.Vermont.

329
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,470
- texas.
- Really? Okay.

330
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,170
"what was their first pet?"

331
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,750
you told me that adorable
story about your pet goat...

332
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:35,080
- Frog Pete.
- .Named richard.

333
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,780
You know,these tests are really stupid.

334
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,730
- We should just... 
- Make out?

335
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,370
see?You know the answers to
all the important questions.

336
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,990
yes.

337
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:49,080
Okay,first question,"if your partner was a
type of food,what kind of food would they be?"

338
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:49,980
grape.

339
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:52,180
Haven't even read you the choices.

340
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:58,860
Am I... Cake...Strawberry-mmm!

341
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:02,030
Or... Toast?

342
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,260
Cake.

343
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:08,160
You're doing that just to hurt me.I
am a strawberry,and you know it.

344
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,760
You know what? I'm going
back to grape. You're a grape.

345
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,440
I am not taking these
quizzes with you anymore.

346
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,090
Typical grape.

347
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,660
Do you le shady hillsides
or babbling brooks?

348
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,780
- Shady hillsides.
- Me,too.

349
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:27,070
Do you prefer a cute and cozy
view or sprawling but beautiful?

350
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,450
- cute and cozy. 
- Well ,I couldn't agree more.
