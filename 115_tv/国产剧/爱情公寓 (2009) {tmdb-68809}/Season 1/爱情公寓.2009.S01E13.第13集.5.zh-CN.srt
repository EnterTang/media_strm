1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,730
《傲骨贤妻》前情回顾
Previously on the Good Wife

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,510
-格伦  -彼得
- Glenn - Peter

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,220
你把我换到集体牢房了
So you put me in the general population.

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,000
是的
Yes

5
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,050
麦迪逊小姐
Miss Madison

6
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,080
你认识这名男子吗
Do you recognize this man?

7
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,450
在和我的当事人交往之前
Prior to your relationship with my client,

8
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,010
你曾经和他有过类似的关系
you had a similar relationship with him.

9
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,090
你不会这样对我
You wouldn't.

10
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,360
为了保护我的家庭  我会不择手段
To protect my family, you have no idea what I'm capable of.

11
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,560
这和性丑闻没关系
This is not about sex.

12
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,260
我重申一遍
Now let me repeat that because it bares repeating.

13
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,300
这和性丑闻没有关系
This is not... about sex.

14
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,900
那到底是为了什么
So, what is this really about?

15
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,120
我的当事人获刑入狱
My client was convicted and sentenced to prison

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,700
不过为了一个简单无趣的理由
for a very simple and almost prosaic reason.

17
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,840
他让下属对某些案件拒绝起诉
He told his subordinates to dp-- decline to prosecute-- certain cases,

18
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,840
而控方认为他这样做
and the prosecution believes this was in trade

19
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,590
是为了换取金钱或性
for financial and sexual favors.

20
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,240
这就是本案的情况
That... is what it comes down to.

21
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,050
不过控方忽略了一点
But the prosecution has a problem.

22
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,020
他们在审讯时提供的
The evidence that they presented at the trial

23
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:05,980
仅仅是间接证据  要想获准复议
was entirely circumstantial, and to be granted a new trial,

24
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,360
我们甚至无需去反驳那些证据
we don't even have to disprove any of it.

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,880
我们只需让法官大人您相信
What we need to do, what we intend to do, is to persuade your honor

26
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,070
如果陪审团当时看到
that if the jury had heard the new evidence

27
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,880
我们将在未来两周内呈现给你的新证据
that you will hear over the next two weeks,

28
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,550
他们可能会做出截然不同的判决
they likely would have reached a different verdict.

29
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,510
不  我没事
No, I'm all right.

30
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,890
我只是在等开庭辩论而已
I'm just, uh, staying for the opening arguments.

31
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:25,670
情况怎么样
How is it going?

32
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:27,240
感觉不错
Good. They feel good.

33
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,780
很好  法官喜欢彼得  
Good. The judge likes Peter.

34
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,600
给他个理由  他就会做对彼得有利的判决
He just needs to be given a reason to decide for him.

35
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,300
话说  还得给你添麻烦
Anyway, sorry to be loading up on you,

36
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,500
客户一小时后就到了
but the client's going to be here in an hour.

37
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,890
什么客户
What client?

38
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,130
科林·斯威尼
Colin Sweeney.

39
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,760
我喜欢别人听到这个名字的反应
I love the reaction that name gets.

40
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,090
好像见了鬼似的
It's like the horses in Young Frankenstein.

41
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,160
我们真的要为他辩护吗
Are we really going to represent him?

42
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,020
我们真的要为他辩护
We are really going to represent him.

43
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,460
而幸运的你呢  要做他的次席律师
And, lucky you, you're now second chair.

44
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,330
确实很幸运
Lucky me.

45
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,400
一小时后见
I'll see you in an hour.

46
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,630
客户们会哗变
Clients are going to bolt.

47
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,120
只有你的客户会
Your clients.

48
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,120
那些不付钱的婆婆妈妈的女权主义者
You mean the bleeding heart feminists who don't pay the bills?

49
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,310
别偷换概念  这和女权主义无关
Don't play that game. This isn't a feminist issue.

50
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,960
科林·斯威尼杀死了他的妻子
Colin Sweeney killed his wife.

51
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,800
科林·斯威尼被判无罪
Colin Sweeney was found not guilty of killing his wife.

52
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,990
-当初辛普森也被判无罪  -是的
- So was O.J. - Yes, and...

53
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,510
但为什么只有我力挺"无罪推定"
why am I the one standing up for "Innocent until proven guilty" Here?

54
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,570
因为你根本意不在此
Because you're not.

55
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,070
你不过是想争取他公司的生意  
You want his company's business.

56
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:17,950
对  你也该这样想
Yes, as should you.

57
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,870
斯特恩一走  公司损失了1/3的生意
We lost a third of our business with Stern leaving the firm.

58
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,170
我们没立场对客户挑三拣四的
We can't turn our noses up at any clients these days.

59
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,630
你心爱的案子无法给公司
Because we know we're not making

60
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,320
-带来任何收入  -那不是我心爱的案子
- any money from your pet causes. - It's not a pet cause.

61
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,360
都还没有立案  我只是考虑一下
It's not even a lawsuit yet. I'm just considering it.

62
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,720
得了  你赢不了的
Come on. You can't win.

63
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,030
你根本不是想打赢
You don't even want to win.

64
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,070
你只想找枪械制造商的麻烦
You just want to harass gun manufacturers.

65
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,830
现在就像在大西部  是吧
So, it's the wild west, is it?

66
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,630
斯特恩走后  你有一个表决权
Without Stern, you have one vote,

67
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,670
我也有一个表决权  我们各自为政
I have one vote, and now it's every man for himself?

68
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,850
看起来是这样
Looks like it.

69
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,730
前景不妙啊
We're heading into a bad time.

70
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,240
左轮手枪  半自动式  6发式  8发式
Revolvers, semiautomatics, six-shot, eight-shot.

71
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,320
为了胜诉  我们必须证明这些制造商
To win, we have to show that the gun manufacturer

72
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,980
故意违反了本州法律
knowingly violated state law

73
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,950
因为他们违法分销枪支
when they allowed guns to be illegally distributed.

74
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,930
这里每支枪  都是在2英里以内买到的
Every single one of them was bought within two miles of here.

75
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,380
-都没装子弹?  -嗯
- They're all unloaded? - Mm-hmm.

76
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,300
拉开枪栓  检查枪膛内是否有子弹
Slide the bolt to check for a chambered round.

77
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,340
卸下弹夹  检查枪管
Drop the magazine. Do a physical check of the barrel.

78
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,330
确实没装子弹
You're unloaded.

79
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,410
太奇怪了
It's so odd--

80
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,430
手枪对人的吸引力  近乎原始
The attraction to handguns. It's almost primal.

81
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,900
看起来真酷  颇有萨拉·佩林之风啊
It's a good look-- Sarah palin-esque.

82
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,180
谢谢你
Oh, wow. Thank you.

83
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,310
那一支呢
What about that one?

84
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,850
沃尔瑟PPK  7发式  9毫米口径
Walther ppk, seven-shot, 9mm.

85
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,740
这东西在外面卖多少钱
And how much would this cost on the street?

86
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:32,680
看情况
It depends.

87
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,970
-这把我花了五十块  -看这把
-That was 50. - Check this out.

88
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,210
-真小  -科林·斯威尼
- It's so small. - Colin sweeney?

89
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,390
听说他奸尸
I heard it was a necrophilia thing.

90
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,950
不  是把他妻子切块  混到狗食里
Nope. Chopped her up. Put her in the dog food.

91
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,960
鬼晓得陪审团怎么想的
Don't know what the hell that jury was thinking.

92
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,780
找不到尸体就很难说服陪审团
Tough to convict when they never found a body.

93
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:46,690
这是完美的犯罪
It's the perfect crime.

94
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,700
现在还有人用这枪身锯短的枪吗
Do people still use sawed-off shotguns these days

95
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,620
还是已经过时了
or is pass?

96
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,940
为什么让艾丽西娅来接
So, why is Alicia on it?

97
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:51,970
你知道为什么
Oh, you know why.

98
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,190
上次起诉他的是她丈夫
Her husband prosecuted him the first time.

99
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,310
所以?
So?

100
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,010
谁最适合替他辩护呢
Who better to defend him?

101
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,510
福瑞克夫人  很高兴见到你
Mrs. Florrick. A pleasure to meet you.

102
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,870
别担心  杀死她的是另外那只手
Don't worry. I killed her with my other hand.

103
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,290
玩笑而已
Joking.

104
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:14,000
抱歉  我去年起开始开这种低级玩笑
Sorry. I've developed a perverse sense of the comic over the last year.

105
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,080
上庭之后  别开这种玩笑  好吗
Okay, well, let's try not to joke like that

106
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,420
你觉得我们需要上庭?
You think it'll come to that-- court?

107
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,840
坎特韦尔是名顶级诉讼律师  他想要上庭
Cantwell is a top litigator-- he wants a trial.

108
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,620
我们的目标是避免让陪审团判决
Our goal is to avoid a jury.

109
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,430
你和辛普森的情况很相似
You're in a similar situation to O.J.,

110
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,290
打个比方  无意冒犯
If you don't mind me continuing the metaphor.

111
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,010
像辛普森一样  你被判无罪
Like O.J., you were found not guilty,

112
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,320
但人们都认为是你干的
but people think you did it,

113
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,350
他们希望你被判有罪
and they want to see you hurt.

114
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,950
你的继女想利用这点
Your stepdaughter is counting on that

115
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,550
因此她才在民事法庭起诉你
That's why she's suing you in civil court.

116
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,760
夏洛特和我一向意见不合
Charlotte-- we never saw eye to eye, I'm afraid.

117
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,600
她恨她母亲为我离开了她父亲
She resented Carolyn leaving her father for me.

118
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,760
不幸的是  伊利诺伊谋杀法令规定
Unfortunately, the Illinois slayer statute says

119
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,330
若你导致某人死亡  就无法继承死者财产
you can't inherit someone's estate if you cause their death.

120
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,690
若夏洛特胜诉  她将得到钱和公司
If Charlotte wins, she gets the money, the company.

121
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,540
你怎么想  福瑞克夫人
What do you think, Mrs. Florrick?

122
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,000
什么我怎么想
What do I think about what?

123
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,550
你的丈夫起诉过我
Your husband prosecuted me.

124
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,530
我是否有罪  你一定有自己的见解
You must have an opinion as to my guilt or innocence.

125
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,160
我的想法无关紧要
My opinion is irrelevant.

126
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,850
此刻它对我来说很重要
Not to me. Not at this moment.

127
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,860
你觉得是我杀了我妻子吗
You think I killed my wife?

128
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,440
当然
Of course.

129
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,750
你雇我们为你辩护...
Look, you pay us to represent your interests...

130
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,070
但没人发现她的尸体
Even though her body was never found?

131
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,280
你想办法处理掉了
I'm sure you found ways to dispose of it.

132
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,200
切成块  然后埋在垃圾坑里  是吗
Chopped her up and buried her in a landfill somewhere?

133
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,560
或者扔进了密歇根湖里
Or in lake Michigan.

134
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,860
那我的不在场证明呢
And my alibi?

135
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,650
你只说你当时正从圣路易斯驾车回芝加哥
That you were driving from St. Louis to Chicago at the time?

136
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:35,290
看来你不介意为杀人犯辩护嘛
So you have no problem representing a murderer?

137
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,510
我很介意
Oh, I have a great problem with it.

138
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,150
但你还是会帮我  对吗
But you'll do it anyway?

139
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,460
除非你想让我回避
Unless you'd like to exclude me.

140
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,820
当然不想
Oh, not for the world.

141
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,380
很好  既然把话说开了...
Okay, great. Well, now that we've got that settled...

142
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,570
全体起立
All rise.

143
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,120
请坐
Sit down.

144
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,250
科里  给门上点润滑油
Cory, let's get some wd-40 on that.

145
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:57,950
安静
Calm down.

146
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,640
把相机给我  就是你  给我
Give me that. You. Now.

147
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,380
别藏了  交出来
Don't try to hide it. Now!

148
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:10,900
我知道  你们对本次庭审都很激动
Okay, now, I know you're all are excited about this trial,

149
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,540
但这不过宗遗产案子
But this is a probate matter, and, as such,

150
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,540
而你们是客  我是主  客随主便
you're just visiting here. I live here. My rules go.

151
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,040
加德纳先生  准备好了吗
Mr. Gardner, are you ready?

152
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,050
是的  法官大人
Yes, your honor.

153
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,190
坎特韦尔先生
Mr. Cantwell?

154
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,720
坎特韦尔在哪里
Where the hell is Cantwell?

155
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:25,600
我...
I, uh...

156
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,150
你是谁
Who are you?

157
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,440
南希·克罗泽
Nancy Crozier...

158
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,280
法官大人  坎特韦尔先生病了
Your honor. Mr. Cantwell has taken sick,

159
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,630
原告由我来跟进
and the plaintiff has asked me to step in.

160
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,090
阿米塔小姐
Miss Armitage?

161
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:36,690
在
Yes.

162
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,560
如果你想另找律师
You can request a continuance if you would like to

163
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,050
就可以要求延期再审
look for other representation.

164
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:44,060
反正被告不计花销
As you can see, the defense has spared no expense.

165
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,930
是的  我知道  法官大人  
Yes, uh, I know, your honor,

166
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,580
但我和南希是老交情了  
but Nancy and I go way back, and I think

167
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,270
我觉得找个信得过的人比较妥当
I'd rather go with someone I trust.

168
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:54,110
年纪轻轻的  哪来的老交情
Ma'am, you're not old enough to go way back,

169
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,820
这位律师叫什么来着
But if, uh, Miss... What is it?

170
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,560
克罗泽
Crozier.

171
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,540
但要是你选择克罗泽
Crozier is your choice...

172
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,970
就请克罗泽小姐上来吧
Come on up here, Miss Crozier.

173
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,680
好  坐在那里
Okay. That's where you sit.

174
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,050
趁她没搞清楚状况
Slip in a motion for a bench trial

175
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,250
提请由法官直接审理此案
before she knows what hit her.

176
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,040
法官大人  我方有一请求
Your honor, just a quick request before we begin.

177
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,570
我方充分信任您对此案的判断  因此
We respect your judgment in this matter, and

178
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,530
我方想请求由法官直接审理此案
we would like to ask for this to be a bench trial.

179
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:14,830
克罗泽小姐?
Miss Crozier?

180
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,490
抱歉  您问什么  法官大人
I'm sorry. Could you...? What was the question, your honor?

181
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,630
他们希望此案由法官直接审理
They would like this to be a bench trial.

182
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,000
他们不想要陪审团审判
They want not to have a jury.

183
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,110
你有异议吗
Do you have an argument?

184
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:29,410
不知道
I don't know.

185
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:35,170
既然你不知道  那我就准予被告请求了
Well, if you don't know, then I must decide against you.

186
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,390
法官大人  我只想说一点  我认为
Well, the one thing that I would say, your honor,

187
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:42,230
由一个成员立场各异的团体来审判
is that... that I do think that it would be fairer

188
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,190
比一人独立审判更公平
to have a cross section of people, not just one.

189
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,830
无意冒犯
Please don't take that the wrong way.

190
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,580
法官大人
Your honor,

191
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,980
我认为  基于法律的审判
I think that it would be... fairer

192
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,730
比基于陪审团的情感倾向的审判
if we decide this matter on the law,

193
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,780
要更公平
not on the passions of a jury.

194
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,150
克罗泽小姐?
Miss Crozier?

195
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,020
这话或许有道理  但我不会试图...
That might be true, but I'm not going to try and, uh...

196
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,550
煽动利用陪审团的情感倾向
rile up those passions.

197
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,140
我只是...  想让他们知道真相
I just... I want them to hear the truth.

198
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,540
你刚赢了你的第一次辩论  克罗泽
Well, you've won your first argument, Miss Crozier.

199
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,640
我们明早开始选择陪审团成员
We'll start choosing a jury tomorrow morning.

200
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,760
谢谢
Thank you.

201
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,760
怎么回事
What happened?

202
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,170
她漂亮  伶俐  年方26
Cute, perky, 26 just happened.

203
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,050
感谢你抽空见我们  布罗迪先生
Thank you for giving us some of your time, Mr. Brody.

204
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:41,610
你们想怎么样
What do you want?

205
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,980
我们打算传唤你出庭作证
We're going to subpoena you to testify.

206
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,970
你们应该知道  我会是个敌意证人
You do understand I'll be a hostile witness?

207
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,310
我们知道  你以前并无敌意
We understand that you weren't always so hostile.

208
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,940
那是在你堕落之前
That was before you were corrupt.

209
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,660
我们只想告诉你  你的敌人不是我们
I think we're saying that we're not the enemy.

210
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,710
是彼得雇你进州检察官办公室
Peter hired you at the state's attorney's office.

211
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,530
他曾四度提拔你
He promoted you four times.

212
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,720
格伦·查尔兹只提拔了你一次
Glenn Childs promoted you once.

213
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,070
而且以后也不会再提拔你
He'll never let you rise any higher.

214
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,010
他认为你和彼得还有瓜葛
He thinks you have one leg still in Peter's camp.

215
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,170
这就是你们的目的
Oh, so that's what this is about?

216
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,120
-影响我的证词  -不是
- Influencing my testimony. - No.

217
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,950
是让你说出真相  即使对查尔兹不利
It's about getting you to tell the truth, even if it hurts Childs.

218
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,030
我向来只说真相
I have always told the truth.

219
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,580
我认识很多只说真相的人
I know a lot of people who've always told the truth,

220
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,990
然而  我却如此下场
and yet, here I stand.

221
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,580
我问你
Let me ask you something.

222
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,690
挨个法庭追击我妻子  你就满足了?
Are you really fulfilled chasing my wife from court to court?

223
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:28,190
我尊敬你  查尔兹却把你当跑龙套的使唤
I respected you. Childs has turned you into an errand boy.

224
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,670
福瑞克先生  你雇用了我  我由衷感激
Mr. Florrick, you hired me. I'm grateful for that.

225
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,950
你管理棘手的部门  我也很钦佩你
You ran a tough department. I admire that.

226
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,350
但从你泄密给你妻子以用于法庭那天起 
But the day you started slipping your wife information

227
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,710
你就失去了我的尊敬
to use in court, that's the day I lost respect for you...

228
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,520
看起来很忙啊
Seems like a busy room.

229
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,260
他们叫我过来的
They asked me here.

230
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,050
是的  他们也叫我过来
Yes, they asked me here, too.

231
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,660
他们肯定想让我们撞见
They must have wanted us to bump into each other.

232
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,010
凑巧而已
Just a quirk in scheduling.

233
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,300
我叫他们去死
I told them to go to hell.

234
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,280
我相信你
I have no doubt.

235
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,090
这就是叫我来的原因吗
So that's why I'm here?

236
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,860
看马坦离开
To see Matan leaving?

237
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,820
不  打牌三缺一
We needed a fourth in our pinochle game.

238
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,630
下次  打电话告诉我你的战略计划
Next time, phone me with your strategic plan,

239
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,370
我就省得离开办公室了
so I don't have to actually leave my office.

240
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,580
蹩脚的戏码
Poor show.

241
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:24,710
你觉得起作用了吗
You think it worked?

242
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,180
等马坦作证时  就知道了
I think we'll know more when Matan testifies.

243
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,140
他妻子死后  他竟然没卖掉这些画
You think he'd sell them after his wife's death.

244
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,140
我猜是在他妻子死后才买的
My guess is he didn't buy them until then.

245
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,260
要安装电子监控吗
So, are they going to go with electronic monitoring?

246
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,980
给彼得?  是的  如果上诉成功的话
For Peter? Yes, if he wins the appeal.

247
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,120
孩子们很激动吧
Kids are excited?

248
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,830
是的  不过有点紧张
Yeah... But nervous.

249
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:49,700
你呢
And you?

250
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,160
一样
Same.

251
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:53,810
以后会很怪  是吧
It's going to be weird, huh?

252
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,860
你指什么
What do you mean?

253
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,670
我也不知道
I don't know what I mean.

254
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,350
我们说好有空共进晚餐的  是吧
We said we'd have dinner, didn't we?

255
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,810
是的  有空去呗
Yes. We should.

256
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,430
很抱歉让你们久等
So sorry to keep you waiting.

257
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,630
希望你们没什么不自在
You're comfortable, I hope.

258
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,770
卡罗琳失踪后  我卖了房子  搬到这里
After Carolyn disappeared, i sold the house and moved in here.

259
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,420
可惜房子有点狭小
A bit cramped, unfortunately.

260
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,330
按照我的理解  
Now, as I understand it,

261
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,920
你们想让我更讨人喜欢
you're going to try to make me more likable.

262
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,040
这是民事诉讼  我们护不了你
Well, in a civil case, we can't keep you off the stand.

263
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,640
你必须出庭作证
You have to testify.

264
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,170
是的  在陪审团面前作证
Yes, before a jury.

265
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,730
真是出人意料
That was unexpected.

266
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,650
法庭经常有出人意料的事
Unexpected things happen in a courtroom,

267
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:36,000
所以我们要尽量避开它们
That’s why we try to avoid them if we can.

268
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,520
你们担心我出庭时会说些不该说的话
And now you're worried i'll say something unfortunate on the stand like

269
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,240
比如怎么处理我妻子的骸骨
what I did with her remains?

270
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,760
严肃一点  斯威尼先生
Take this seriously, Mr. Sweeney.

271
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,130
如果你珍惜自己的钱  就该严肃一点
If you value your money, you should take this seriously.

272
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,910
谢谢  福瑞克女士
Thank you, Mrs. Florrick.

273
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,480
我知道了  我也的确珍惜我的钱
Of course. And I do value my money,

274
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,150
我会严肃的
So I will.

275
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,350
民事诉讼中  对方律师会穷追猛打
A civil case can get ugly.

276
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,590
他们会对你的婚姻问题吹毛求疵
They can pick apart your marital troubles with a fine-tooth comb.

277
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,640
你和你妻子常吵架  是吗
You two fought a lot, didn't you?

278
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,720
经常吵
Constantly.

279
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,500
我和卡罗琳的关系就像暴风雨
Carolyn and I had a tempestuous relationship.

280
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,950
可我们深爱着对方
But we were devoted to each other,

281
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,760
典型的一个愿打  一个愿挨
classically s and m.

282
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,960
-那是她吗  -是的
- That's her? - Yes.

283
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,840
她讨厌那张照片  所以我把它放大
She hated that photo, so I had it enlarged.

284
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:22,940
他们会提出证据  证明你与多名女子有染
They will put on evidence that you were unfaithful to her with multiple women.

285
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,160
是真的吗
Is that true?

286
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:27,170
我有和其他女人上床
Well, I had sex with other women.

287
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:31,440
卡罗琳不玩把戏  她知道我需要它们
Carolyn didn't do tricks. She knew I needed them,

288
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,530
所以她同意我找别的女人
so she was okay with me going elsewhere.

289
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,840
什么"把戏"
I'm sorry, "Tricks"?

290
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,510
皮装  手铐  穿异性服装...
Leather, handcuffs, cross-dressing...

291
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,860
这让我更讨喜呢  还是相反
Does that make me more likable or less?

292
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,670
近期来  我都忘了这时代的主流了
I've lost track of the zeitgeist these days.

293
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,030
你声称自己还爱着她
But you still claim you were in love?

294
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,080
是的  疯狂地爱着她
Yes, madly.

295
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,440
她的会计在谋杀案的审讯时作证
Her accountant testified at the murder trial

296
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,280
说她当天要求查账
that she demanded to see the books that day,

297
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,910
一查之下  她非常震怒
and something she saw apparently upset her.

298
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,140
她发现
One of the things she saw was this.

299
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:00,700
你从账上提取了几十万美金
Withdrawals, made by you, for hundreds and thousands of dollars.

300
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,980
我说过  卡罗琳不介意我的小小嗜好
I told you. Carolyn didn't begrudge me my appetites.

301
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,670
有传言说  她有意把你踢出家族生意
There were rumors that she wanted to oust you from the family business.

302
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:13,040
还有传言说  你默许你丈夫召妓
Yes, and there were rumors you knew of your husband's whores.

303
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,650
出庭最好别这么回答
Probably not the best answer in court.

304
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,920
当你得知妻子的死讯  你说
Is it true that when they told you of your wife's death,

305
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,660
"这下好  桥牌缺人了"  此事是否属实
you said, "Oh, no, now I'll need a fourth for bridge."

306
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,550
是的
Yes.

307
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,260
当保罗得知列侬的死讯
And when Paul Mccartney was told

308
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,350
他说  "真他妈倒霉"
of John Lennon's death, he said, "What a drag."

309
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,260
我不适合作证  是吧
I'm not going to be a very good witness, am I?

310
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,410
没错
No, you're not.

311
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:45,580
她不是我杀的
I didn't do it.

312
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,670
这语调效果如何
How did that sound?

313
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,200
沃尔库特森  3.5口径
Volquartsen 3.5 compact.

314
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,770
重3磅  10发弹夹  
Three pounds, ten-shot mag,

315
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,790
可调表尺  片状准星
adjustable rear and blade front--

316
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,180
见神杀神  遇鬼灭鬼
It'll take down any man in his tracks.

317
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,340
如果她没有持枪许可证呢
What if she doesn't have a FOID?

318
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,560
去申请  30天就能批下来
Apply for one. You'll have a gun in 30 days.

319
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,140
如果她等不了30天呢
What if she doesn't have 30 days?

320
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,070
你有持枪许可证吗
Do you have a firearm owner id?

321
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,900
你帮她买
Then buy it for her.

322
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,260
失陪
Excuse me.

323
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,860
这是我们的突破口
That's our case.

324
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,850
非法枪支就是这样外流的
That's how illegal guns get out on the street.

325
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,770
你想买吗
So, do you want to buy it?

326
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,650
我们需要它吗
Do we need it?

327
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:29,810
不知道
I don't know.

328
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,580
你需要它吗
Do you?

329
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,310
我在查出庭安排时发现
I was checking on a court date and I found out.

330
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,650
你决定不立案
you passed on the lawsuit.

331
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,010
那为什么还来这里
So, what are we doing here?

332
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,760
10年前  一名叫杰弗里·斯佩尔曼的毒贩
Ten years ago, a drug dealer named Jeffrey Spellman

333
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,550
因24区的双重谋杀案而获罪
was convicted of double murder in the 24th ward.

334
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,950
在他的量刑听证会上
At his sentencing hearing, he threatened

335
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,010
他叫嚣  出狱后要杀了他的律师
to kill his lawyer when he got out.

336
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:00,950
你就是他的律师?
You were his lawyer?

337
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,090
我还在他上周的假释听证会上发言了
I also spoke last week at his parole hearing.

338
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,180
他看见你发言了?
He saw you speak?

339
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,350
他放了狠话
He'd made subsequent threats.

340
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,020
他假释出狱了吗
Has he been released?

341
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,040
周五才裁定
They decide on Friday.

342
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,330
好吧  你得买把枪
Okay. You need a gun.

343
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,650
问题是
No, the thing is,

344
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,850
我向来是支持枪支管制的先锋
I've been in the forefront of gun control my entire life.

345
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:28,270
我父亲最先把枪支管制纳入伊利诺斯宪法
My father wrote the first legislation into the Illinois constitution.

346
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,820
你需要一把容易上手的枪
You need something easy to shoot.

347
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,380
后坐力小  9毫米口径  贝雷塔枪
Light on recoil, 9mm-- a beretta.

348
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,370
我不该来的
No, this was a mistake.

349
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,400
我知道你是我老板
Look, I know you're my boss,

350
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,630
我遵从你的意思
and I'll do whatever you want.

351
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,270
但一个杀人犯看见你
You spoke at a killer's parole hearing

352
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,800
在他的假释听证会上发言  反对他假释出狱
and he saw you speak against his release.

353
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,480
事急从权
That's what I'd call a volatile situation.

354
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,290
听我一回  你需要一把枪
So listen to me on this. You need a gun.

355
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:58,620
这个特别工作组调查欺诈性房地产交易
It was a task force focusing on fraudulent real estate deals.

356
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,370
你们管这些交易叫"翻地"?
And these deals were called "Land flips"?

357
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,300
-是  -据你所知
- Yes. - And as you understood it,

358
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:06,990
有人试图利用欺诈手段  低价购买
there was an attempt to buy land, cheaply, through fraudulent means,

359
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,600
即将动工的奥运会场周围的土地
near the stadiums that were to be built for the Olympics?

360
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,520
是
Yes, sir.

361
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,200
在你管理这个工作组期间
And during the time you were heading up this task force,

362
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,980
查尔兹先生找上你
you were approached by Mr. Childs

363
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,690
让你盯着福瑞克先生  是吗
to keep an eye on Mr. Florrick, isn't that correct?

364
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,530
请定义一下"盯着"
Could you define "Keep an eye on"?

365
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:29,090
他暗示福瑞克先生建立工作组是别有用心
He suggested that Mr. Florrick had a hidden motive for this task force.

366
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,270
反对
Objection, your honor.

367
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,800
兰德里先生  你反对这干嘛
I have no idea why you are objecting to that, Mr. Landry.

368
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,470
诱导性问题
A leading question, your honor.

369
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:39,350
我大概需要个记分牌
I know I might need a scorecard here, Mr. Landry.

370
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:43,000
布罗迪先生不是站在你们那边的吗
Isn't Mr. Brody a hostile witness? Isn't he on your side?

371
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,430
但这仍是个诱导性问题
It's still leading, your honor.

372
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,400
反对无效  证人请回答
Overruled. You may answer the question.

373
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,010
是的
Yes.

374
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,780
你说"是的"  是什么意思
You may have to remind us all what that "Yes" Means.

375
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,140
是的  查尔兹先生暗示彼得是别有用心
Yes, Mr. Childs suggested Peter might have a hidden motive.

376
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,460
别有用心  是指福瑞克先生借此工作组
This hidden motive was that Mr. Florrick arranged this task force

377
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,230
来要挟房地产开发商向他行贿?
in order to then shake down the real estate developers for payoffs?

378
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:04,940
是的
Yes, sir.

379
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,230
你同意查尔兹先生的看法吗
And did you agree with Mr. Childs' estimation?

380
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,340
我的想法无关紧要  我只是按要求办事
My opinion was irrelevant. I did what I was asked.

381
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,380
谁的要求
By whom?

382
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:14,890
什么
Excuse me.

383
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,500
你说你是按要求办事
You said that you did what you were asked.

384
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,230
谁的要求呢
Who were you referring to?

385
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,000
这只是一种措辞方式
It was a figure of speech.

386
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,710
我知道  但措辞方式有它的含义
I understand, but figures of speech mean something,

387
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,510
那么  是谁的要求呢
so who asked you to do something:

388
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,310
是你的上级  福瑞克先生
Was it your boss, Mr. Florrick,

389
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:29,000
还是和你平级的查尔兹先生
or was it Mr. Childs, your peer?

390
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,580
查尔兹先生
Mr. Childs.

391
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,770
他让你干什么
What did he ask you to do?

392
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,670
他让我留意彼得的动向
He asked me to keep track of Peter.

393
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,380
他说彼得对一些案子拒绝起诉  是收了贿赂
He thought he was being bribed to dp cases.

394
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,720
那么这些案子现在进展如何
And so, how are these cases going now?

395
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,230
什么
Excuse me?

396
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,480
福瑞克先生让你不予起诉的那些案子
These cases that Mr. Florrick asked you to drop--

397
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:55,840
既然福瑞克不能再横加阻挠
I mean, you must be fervently pursuing them

398
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,370
这些案子  你们一定一查到底吧?
now that Peter Forrick is no longer around to obstruct them.

399
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,980
-不  -天呐  那你们怎么处理的
- No, sir. - My goodness. What happened to them?

400
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,660
我们没有起诉
We dropped them.

401
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,630
到你发问了
Your witness.

402
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,010
谢谢法官大人
Thank you, your honor.

403
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,480
事先说明
Uh, actually, just to be clear,

404
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,190
你是被告的小姨子  玛瑞尔?
you are the defendant's sister-in-law, Mariel?

405
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,240
你是说杀害我姐姐的被告?
The defendant who killed my sister?

406
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,190
-没错  -法官大人  这还用我反对吗
- Yes. - Your honor, do I really need to object?

407
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,780
加德纳先生  咱们都得有点敬业精神
We all need to perform our roles here, Mr. Gardner.

408
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,670
所以你还是说声"反对"吧
Yes, you need to object,and,

409
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,550
而我呢  得说声"反对有效"
yes, I need to sustain.

410
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,090
抱歉  法官大人 下不为例
I'm sorry, your honor. We won't let that happen again.

411
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:39,530
现在  我得问你一个不光彩的问题
Now, I have to ask you a question that I am not proud of.

412
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,740
-和性有关的  你介意吗  -不介意
-  sexual question. Do you mind? - No.

413
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,430
-问吧  不然我来干嘛  -好吧
- Please. That's why I'm here. - Okay.

414
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:50,510
你和被告斯威尼先生  发生过...
You and the defendant, Mr. Sweeney, had

415
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,240
性关系?
sexual relations?

416
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:53,150
是啊
Yeah.

417
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,290
-他和他妻子的妹妹有染?  -没错
- He had sex with his wife's sster? - Yeah, that's correct.

418
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:01,370
抱歉  我脸红了
Sorry. I think I'm blushing.

419
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,260
我来自密歇根州  从没遇到过这种事
I'm from Michigan. This is all new to me.

420
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,210
她很厉害
She's very good.

421
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,900
阿米塔小姐
Uh, Miss Armitage,

422
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,890
究竟是什么
What could possibly have led you

423
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,540
使得你和你亲姐姐的丈夫发生性关系
to sleep with your own sister's husband?

424
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,970
我一直有毒瘾
I struggled with addiction my whole life,

425
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,370
我姐姐因此与我疏远
and my sister and I were estranged over it.

426
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:25,100
我想  或许  我只是为了报复她
So I suppose I-- I don't know-- i did it just to get back at her.

427
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,330
而科林很乐意帮我一把
And Colin was too happy to help.

428
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:31,330
他让我做一些事  一些她妻子不肯做的事
He used to make me do things. You know, things his wife wouldn't do.

429
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,220
有一次  他让我绑住他的...
Like the time he had me tie up his...

430
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,780
请别说了  我得坐下
I think that that is enough. I'm just going to sit down.

431
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,750
谢谢
Thank you.

432
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,460
干得好  丹尼尔  真是漂亮
Great job, Daniel, just outstanding.

433
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,110
你看见查尔兹的表情了吗
Did you see Childs?

434
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,570
我想我们现在逼近核心了
I think we're getting really close now.

435
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,250
怎么了
What?

436
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,130
罗曼·别利科夫   那个我们用来威胁
Roman Belikov, the Russian mobster

437
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,770
安贝儿·麦迪逊的俄国暴徒
we used to threaten Amber Madison with?

438
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,900
他怎么了
What about him?

439
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,630
构不成威胁了
Not such a threat anymore.

440
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:05,630
[暴徒遇害]

441
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:13,110
安贝儿告诉查尔兹  她不愿作证
Amber told Childs that she wouldn't testify.

442
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,100
现在她肯定疯狂反扑我们
I guess now she'll be out for blood.

443
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,260
情况不容乐观啊
It's not going to be pretty.

444
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,000
我不去
No. I won't be there.

445
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:39,470
我明白  场面可能会很难堪
No, I understand. It might be rough.

446
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,710
麦迪逊什么都说得出来
Madison could say anything.

447
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,560
不过戈登说你最好出席  
Although Golden does think it would be better if you were there,

448
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,470
这样法官就能看见我们...
so that he judge could see we...

449
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,060
戈登还说  如果我获释
Golden also says that the sheriff's department

450
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:55,400
警方会在家里安装电子监控
will be setting up electronic monitoring at the house if I am released.

451
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,590
-你能接受吗  -没问题
- Are you all right with that? - Yes.

452
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,090
但咱们约法三章
But I wanted to agree on a few things first.

453
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,730
你说
Okay.

454
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,210
家里有间佣人房  现在当储物间用
There's a maid's room. I've been using it for storage,

455
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,010
我会收拾干净  安置张床
but I will clear it out and put a bed in there.

456
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,020
此外  你可以使用主浴室
In the meantime, you can use the master bath.

457
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,970
我上班时  杰姬帮忙照应家里
Jackie has been helping out on weekdays while I'm at work,

458
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,330
我觉得应该继续让她帮忙
and I think she should continue--

459
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,410
接孩子们放学  做饭...
picking the kids up from school, making dinner...

460
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,150
还有  家里没有书房
And we don't have a study.

461
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,650
你那张卷轴面的书桌还在  现在闲置着
I still have your old rolltop desk; it's in storage.

462
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:36,890
我会把它搬到餐厅  如何
I will move it to the dining room. Okay?

463
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,300
你爱我吗
Do you love me?

464
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,090
爱
I do.

465
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,900
你对我说话的方式  就像个律师
You're sounding like a lawyer.

466
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,040
我本来就是律师
I am a lawyer.

467
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,430
你到底想和我重新开始吗
Do you ever want to be together again?

468
00:21:52,860 --> 00:22:00,200
彼得  你伤我很深
Peter... I've been hurt, deeply.

469
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:04,720
我想有一天  我会痊愈  但现在...
I imagine I will heal someday, but for now...

470
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,070
我们慢慢来  好吗
We need a plan, okay?

471
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,480
好吧
Okay.

472
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,920
握紧  聚焦前瞄准具
The grip is still. Focus is on the front sight.

473
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,190
站稳了吗
Are you steady?

474
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,900
应该是吧
I think so.

475
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,140
接下来是最难的部分  扣扳机
Now the hardest part-- the trigger.

476
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,050
你会本能地用手掌和手腕的肌肉
There's a natural tendency for the muscles

477
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,530
连同手指一起用力
in the hand and wrist to move in tandem with the fingers.

478
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:27,790
你得避免这个
You need to resist that.

479
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:31,390
必须用食指单独发力扣扳机
You need to let your forefinger act independently, squeezing.

480
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,730
听懂了吗
Do you understand?

481
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,030
应该是吧
I think so.

482
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:37,720
好  放松点
And so, with almost no pressure at all,

483
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,400
瞄准目标的中心
concentrate on the center of your target.

484
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,530
为什么非得打要害
Why can't I shoot to injure?

485
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,270
开枪就得杀人
You pick up a gun, you shoot to kill

486
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,510
不然就别拿枪
or you don't pick up a gun.

487
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:55,020
他假释出狱了  那个威胁你的毒贩
He got out-- your parolee.

488
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,660
我知道
I know.

489
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,690
你使用致命的武力
You're trying to stop with deadly force

490
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,360
只是为了阻止他杀害你
somebody who is trying to kill you.

491
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,950
他一样有双亲  一样开生日派对
Somebody who has a mother, a father, birthday parties.

492
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,810
把他当作假想靶子  或者靶心
They're a shadow target, a bull's-eye.

493
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,270
你不把他们当人看
So you dehumanize them?

494
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:09,720
环境造成的
They are dehumanized.

495
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,080
这世界不是按你的规则运作
The world doesn't March to your drummer.

496
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,180
它有时很危险  很残酷
It's sometimes dangerous and cruel,

497
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,240
所以  慢慢地  小心地  举起武器
so slowly and carefully raise your weapon,

498
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:20,370
手指单独用力  拳头和手臂别使劲
make your finger work independently of your fist and arm,

499
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:24,560
然后缓缓地  冷漠地扣扳机
and gently and indifferently squeeze.

500
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,050
天呐
Oh, my God.

501
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,510
不赖嘛
Nice.

502
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:33,680
举枪  再来一次
Raise your arm and try again.

503
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,030
斯威尼先生  警方在你住所
So, um, as I was saying, Mr. Sweeney,

504
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:45,330
发现了沾了血迹和皮屑的绳子  是吗
there was blood and skin found on a rope at your house, right?

505
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:47,920
是的
Yes, that's right.

506
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:51,840
警方声明  绳子上的血液和皮屑
And, uh, this blood and skin--

507
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,230
与你妻子的吻合  是吗
the police say it all matched your wife. Is that right?

508
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,560
是的  我们喜欢自己砍柴  
Yes, we like to cut our own firewood

509
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,030
然后用绳子捆起来
and wrap the kindling in rope,

510
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:03,160
我亲爱的卡罗琳肯定是砍柴时割伤了
And I believe my dearest Carolyn cut herself.

511
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,330
听上去挺合理
Yeah, that seems understandable, I get that.

512
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,260
那么让我冒昧问你一个问题 
So, I need to ask you this, Mr. Sweeney, please excuse me.

513
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,600
说吧  姑娘
Go right ahead, dear.

514
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:15,030
你并未掐死你妻子  是吗
You never strangled your wife, right?

515
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:17,050
天呐  当然没有
My goodness, no.

516
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:17,770
那就好
Thank god.

517
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:22,050
那么...
So this, uh...

518
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,660
在这儿
...Here.

519
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,570
这是什么
What is this?

520
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,940
医院报告
Hospital report.

521
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:31,610
杀手锏来了
Here it comes.

522
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,510
你来反对  效果比我要好
You object-- it'll play better from you.

523
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,160
这一定是弄错了  是吗
This-this must be an aberration, right?

524
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:38,200
我不知道  我看不见
I don't know, I can't see it.

525
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:42,280
上面写着你妻子97年4月被送入医院
It says here that your wife was admitted to the hospital, April 1997.

526
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,560
反对
Objection, your honor.

527
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,960
此证据与案情无关  在之前的谋杀案审理中
This was excluded from the previous trial

528
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,420
未被采用
for relevance.

529
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,430
反对无效
I'll allow.

530
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:51,410
你的异议已记录在案  请坐下
Your exception is noted, counselor. Sit down.

531
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:54,660
你妻子对医务人员说了些奇怪的事
Your wife seems to have told the medical staff something extraordinary.

532
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,900
她说你想勒死她
She said that you tried to strangle her.

533
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,860
她夸大其辞了
That's a bit melodramatic.

534
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:02,340
我知道  不过我妈教导我  不懂就要问
Yes, I know it is, but my mom always used to say "When you don't know,

535
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,550
所以...  我在请教你
ask," So... This is me asking.

536
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,250
好吧
Certainly.

537
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,280
卡罗琳和我是窒息游戏的爱好者
Carolyn and I were practitioners of breath play.

538
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:11,860
什么是窒息游戏
I'm sorry, what is breath play?

539
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:15,240
我相信密歇根州也有这种游戏
Well, I'm sure they have it in Michigan, too, Miss Crozier.

540
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,930
窒息游戏是一种性游戏
Breath play is erotic asphyxiation.

541
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:23,000
卡罗琳喜欢在做爱时  感受窒息的快感
Carolyn liked the feeling of being strangled when she was having sex.

542
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,670
我想我还是坐下吧
Oh, I think I'd better sit down now.

543
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,750
到你发问了
Your witness.

544
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,580
好  我们发动攻势
Okay, we go on the offensive.

545
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,180
我不会让一个26岁的
I'm not going to let some 26-year-old

546
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,920
法学院毕业生压制住
law school grad get the better of me.

547
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,950
她在演戏
It's an act.

548
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,090
效果很好
Well, it's working.

549
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,720
既然无法证明斯威尼的清白
If we can't prove our guy is innocent,

550
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,830
我们就拖其他人下水
we need to shovel dirt on somebody else.

551
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,890
原告怎么样
What about the plaintiff?

552
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:51,160
夏洛特?  她刚失去了母亲  
Charlotte? The jury felt sorry for her.

553
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,760
陪审团同情她  我们不能说她是凶手
She lost her mother. We can't suggest she's the killer.

554
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:56,440
把矛头对准死者妹妹玛瑞尔
Go after the sister Mariel, suggest she was the killer.

555
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,800
陪审团也喜欢她
The jury liked her, too.

556
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,900
不是喜欢她  只是相信她
They didn't like her, they believed her.

557
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,790
继续说
I'm listening.

558
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,070
玛瑞尔嫉妒她姐姐
Mariel was jealous of her sister.

559
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,980
她和斯威尼上床  是为了报复她姐姐
She slept with Sweeney to get back at her.

560
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,990
根据我的经验  
In my experience,

561
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,440
这种极端的嫉妒  不会轻易化解
that level of jealousy just doesn't end.

562
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,010
警察验证过她的不在场证明吗
Did the cops even check her alibi?

563
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:11,720
她自称卡罗琳失踪时正在戒毒所里
Supposedly she was in rehab when Carolyn disappeared.

564
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,780
好  传讯她的证词  艾丽西娅
Okay, get a subpoena for the records, and, Alicia,

565
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,920
要推翻玛瑞尔的不在场证明
if we're tearing down the sister's alibi,

566
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,350
我们得证明斯威尼的不在场证明
we need to shore up Sweeney's.

567
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,490
-真有意思  -那是
- How fun. - Yep,

568
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:19,760
目前你可是斯威尼的经纪人
you're the Sweeney wrangler these days.

569
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,550
跟你说了  我当时正从圣路易斯驾车回家
I told you I was in my car on the drive back from St. Louis.

570
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,080
没有导航仪  也没手机?
With no gps and no cell phone?

571
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,550
你喜欢日本漫画吗
You like manga?

572
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:33,820
我觉得它们的画风非常率真
I find the style bracingly visceral.

573
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,130
你没在从圣路易斯回家的路上  是吧
You weren't on your way back from St. Louis, were you?

574
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:41,670
没错
No.

575
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,240
你知道我们要输了吗
Do you know that we're losing?

576
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:46,680
我知道
Yes.

577
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:52,010
那就别扯谎  别分散我的注意力
So no stories, no lies, no diversions.

578
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,240
你到底在哪
Where were you?

579
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,550
马可  这是我的律师
Marco, this is my lawyer.

580
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:04,290
你告诉她  我妻子失踪那天我在哪里
I need you to tell her where I was the day my wife disappeared.

581
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,730
我和往常一样3:30左右到这来
I got here about 3:30 like I always do.

582
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,740
随后你就来买大烟
You rolled up after that, looking to score some opie.

583
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,160
就是鸦片  有时和肉末混着吃
Opium, sometimes mixed with hash.

584
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,220
现在知道我为何不告诉你了吧
Now you see why I didn't tell you before?

585
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,370
真不是你做的?
So you didn't do it?

586
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:24,200
杀卡罗琳吗  没有
Kill Carolyn? No.

587
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,170
那你那些把戏和笑话是为了什么
Then why all the games and the jokes?

588
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,440
两位让让
Do you guys mind?

589
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,540
我还要做生意
I'm working here.

590
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,210
你知道我何时开始
You know when I started getting

591
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:34,600
能在餐厅坐上最好的位置吗
the best tables in restaurants?

592
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,700
正是人们以为我杀妻的那天
The day they thought I killed my wife.

593
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,120
这值得吗
Is that really worth

594
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,350
就为了餐厅最好的座位?
getting the best tables in restaurants?

595
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:42,480
当然值得
Of course.

596
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,790
和你一样  人们从此对我忌惮三分
Why do you look at me the way you do?

597
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,600
我的照片
Why is my picture

598
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,500
出现在《芝加哥太阳时报》头版
 on the front page of the Chicago Sun-times?

599
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,880
八卦杂志刊登我昨晚看了哪场戏
Why does page six care what play I saw last night?

600
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,840
如果妻子死了  而大家都认为是你干的
If your wife is dead, and everyone thinks you did it,

601
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:01,010
证明我杀没杀她有什么意义呢
well, really, what's the difference?

602
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,130
克罗泽小姐
Miss Crozier.

603
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:07,670
你好
Hello?

604
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,790
你好
Oh, hi.

605
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,820
抱歉我忘了你的名字
I'm sorry, I've forgotten your name.

606
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,790
艾丽西娅·福瑞克
Alicia Florrick.

607
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,490
幸会
Right, nice to see you.

608
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,320
我真的希望今天可以谈妥
I really hope that we can make a deal today.

609
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:19,790
我很讨厌法庭上的争斗
I just hate this courtroom fighting.

610
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,130
威尔建议我们先谈着
Yes, well, Will suggested that we get started,

611
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,990
他一会就过来
and he will join us later.

612
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,990
你在法庭上表现得很好
You're doing very well in court.

613
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,740
没觉得  我还是个新手
Oh, I don't know about that. I'm just a beginner.

614
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,690
不  你不是
Hmm, no, you're not.

615
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,540
这话怎么讲
Why do you say that?

616
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,740
因为我觉得你很清楚自己在做什么
Because I think you know exactly what you're doing.

617
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,940
我倒想呢
I wish I did.

618
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,610
你的证人玛瑞尔
Your witness Mariel--

619
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:40,580
在谋杀当晚  没有不在场证据
She doesn't have an alibi the night of the murder.

620
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,650
她4点离开戒毒所
She left rehab at 4:00.

621
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:45,020
然后因为嫉妒赶去杀掉姐姐吗
And what, rushed over to kill her sister out of jealousy?

622
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,320
这种事常有
Been known to happen.

623
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,450
陪审团不讨厌她
The jury didn't hate her.

624
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,560
他们讨厌你的客户
They hated your client.

625
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,960
我们和斯威尼先生谈过
We spoke to Mr. Sweeney.

626
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,420
他愿意分你客户一半遗产
He's willing to offer your client 50% of the estate.

627
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,400
不行
No.

628
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,260
他害夏洛特失去母亲
Charlotte lost her mother to Sweeney.

629
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,000
他没有资格得到遗产
He has to walk away from the estate.

630
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:59,870
她每年会给他生活费  每次不超过30万
She'll offer him a yearly stipend-- low six figures.

631
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:00,550
不行
No.

632
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,000
斯威尼先生有不在场证明
Mr. Sweeney has an alibi.

633
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,370
肯定很可靠吧
Well, I'm sure it's a good one.

634
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:05,960
要证明它的真实性  过程一定很有趣
It'll be fun to try and prove it.

635
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,210
看来没什么可谈的了
I guess we don't have anything to talk about, then.

636
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,950
但见到你很高兴
But it was nice to meet you.

637
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,850
我真喜欢你的外套
And I really love your jacket.

638
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,620
我妈妈有件一模一样的
My mom has one just like it.

639
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:28,030
今晚热点  是卡罗琳·阿米塔失踪案的
Our top story tonight involves the shocking developments

640
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:30,560
令人震惊的案情进展
in the Carolyn Armitage disappearance case.

641
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,750
警察怀疑
Police strongly suspect

642
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,870
阿米塔的遗骸已被发现
that Armitage's remains have been uncovered.

643
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:38,870
今晨  一位建筑工
A construction crew made the grisly discovery this morning

644
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:42,010
在科林·斯威尼原住所的院子里发现部分骸骨
in the courtyard of Colin Sweeney's penthouse apartment,

645
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:45,070
此处在他妻子失踪后即被售出
A residency sold after the disappearance of his wife.

646
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,800
骸骨在花园被浅土掩埋
The remains, which were found in a shallow grave

647
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,210
尚未做身份鉴定
in the flower garden, have yet to be identified,

648
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:54,290
但调查人员相信它属于卡罗琳
But investigators believe they belong to the missing Carolyn Armitage.

649
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,840
我不知为何感觉很糟
I don't know why I feel bad.

650
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:59,930
-至少我们确定是他干的了  -是
- At least we know for certain now he did it. - Yep,

651
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,660
而我们还要继续为他辩护
and we're still defending him.

652
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:05,070
《芝加哥报》指出  千夫所指的科林
...Chicago Society figure, Colin Sweeney,

653
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,670
完全有可能是谋杀犯
a man who many believe is entirely capable of murder.

654
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:15,850
少来这套
Oh, don't even try it.

655
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,710
少来哪套?
What?

656
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,080
鳄鱼的眼泪
To patronize me with your tears.

657
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:24,590
我知道很不可思议
I thought somewhere in the back of my mind--

658
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,770
但我其实一直暗存希望
and I will admit that it made no sense--

659
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:31,520
卡罗琳可能还活着
Carolyn might be still alive.

660
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:36,830
就像漫画里的肯·雷  假死脱身
Like Ken Lay, faking his own death, and hopping off

661
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,410
躲到某个小岛上
to a small island somewhere.

662
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:40,270
你是说  你和此事无关吗
So you're saying you had nothing to do with this?

663
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:47,190
我是做过许多错事  我承认
I'm saying I've done some terrible things in my life. I have.

664
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:50,010
但我没杀我妻子
But I did not kill my wife.

665
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:52,480
那她为何被埋在你的院子里
Then how did her skull end up buried in your backyard?

666
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:55,050
有人栽赃
Someone put it there!

667
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:58,930
彼得
Peter's the sort of man

668
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:01,500
是个希望凡事都由别人为他安排好的人
who expects things to be handed to him.

669
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:03,300
包括我在内
Like I was.

670
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,230
-你们是约在酒店吗  -是的
- This was at the hotel? - Yes.

671
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,570
我订了间房
I had a room.

672
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:09,270
他打电话给他妻子  说会晚归
He called his wife, said he'd be late.

673
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:12,370
完事后  他会约我下次见面
And then afterwards, he asked me if he could see me again.

674
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,370
你们见了多少次
How many times?

675
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,360
很多次  持续了几个月
Two dozen. It went on for months.

676
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,540
有时候一周2  3次
Sometimes two, three times a week.

677
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:22,240
-他知道有人买单?  -是的
- And he knew you were being provided to him? - Yes.

678
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,340
完事后  我会打电话要求付款
Afterwards, I would make a call in order to be paid.

679
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,110
打电话时他也在场
He heard me make those calls.

680
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,080
福瑞克夫人
Mrs. Florrick.

681
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:34,300
...他有说过要回报你的... 
...Say anything about having to do something in return for your...

682
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:34,960
不进去吗
Would you like to come in?

683
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,900
服务吗?
services?

684
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,460
是的
Yes.

685
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,980
他说那些买单的人官司缠身
He told me that the men who paid me had cases against them.

686
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:45,820
他说会关照他们的案子
He understood that he had to do something about those cases.

687
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,290
关照?
"Do something"?

688
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:50,230
就是让它们不了了之
Oh, um, make them go away.

689
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,790
他还拿这事开玩笑
He laughed about it, actually.

690
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,700
说在芝加哥办事  就得付出这种代价
said that was the price of doing business in Chicago.

691
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:58,970
到你发问了
Your witness.

692
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:01,470
麦迪逊女士  你说福瑞克知道
Ms. Madison, you say that Mr. Florrick knew

693
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:02,940
有人替他付钱?
that someone else was paying for your services?

694
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:03,950
是的
Yes.

695
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,480
那么  为何他自己还要付钱给你
Then,why would he pay you as well?

696
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,110
他从没付钱
He never did.

697
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,070
你知道这是什么吗
Do you... recognize this?

698
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,720
不
No.

699
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,490
这是银行记录
It's bank records

700
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:22,890
户主是洛蕾塔·克里斯宾斯基
from an account in the name of Loretta Krispinsky.

701
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,130
这是你的真名  对吧
That is your real name, isn't it?

702
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:30,020
这个账户  前阵子被注销了
Now, this particular account was closed some time ago,

703
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,660
但交易记录还在
But the transactions are there.

704
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:36,360
多次有固定金额3500美元存入账户
Repeated deposits in the amount of $3,500.

705
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:40,470
而福瑞克先生的一个私人账户
Now, these are records from one of Mr. Florrick's personal accounts,

706
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:48,610
有相应的提款记录  金额也是3500
with corresponding withdrawals in the same amount of $3,500.

707
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:53,820
通常在你存款前的1到2天内
Always within a day or two of when you deposited the money.

708
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,650
我得提醒你  你是对庭宣誓过的
Now, I'm going to remind you that you're under oath,

709
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:59,710
麦迪逊女士  或者该叫克里斯宾斯基女士?
Ms. Madison, or should I say, ms. Krispinsky?

710
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,890
有两方付钱给你
You were paid twice.

711
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:05,990
-对吗 -不是
- Isn't that correct? - No.

712
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,990
有求于福瑞克的人付钱让你陪他
You were paid by your procurers, who thought that

713
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,960
以为他接受了他们的贿赂
they were bribing Mr. Florrick for your services,

714
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:13,030
而福瑞克先生也付钱给你
and you were also paid by Mr. Florrick,

715
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,670
他根本不知道有别人付账
who didn't know that you were being paid by others.

716
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,510
是这样吗
Isn't that correct?

717
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:20,070
这不过是个巧合  你歪曲事实
You can make numbers look like anything you want.

718
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,680
不  没人能歪曲事实
Well, actually... you can't.

719
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,550
我问完了  法官大人
I have no further questions for this witness, your honor.

720
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:29,550
我想我们已经见识了安贝儿·麦迪逊了
I think we've had quite enough of Amber Madison.

721
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,540
我翻查了斯威尼的妻子在失踪那天早上
I've been going over the books Sweeney's wife demanded to

722
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,810
要求查看的帐本
see the morning she disappeared,

723
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:35,450
看看这个
and look at this.

724
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,580
蕾马特  什么东西
Renmart? What's that?

725
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:41,400
夏洛特·阿米塔成立的一间皮包公司
It's a dummy corporation Charlotte Armitage set up.

726
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,280
所以我把账本和其它线索对照了一下
So I cross-referenced the books against the other discovery,

727
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:44,830
看看这个
and look at this.

728
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:47,800
玛瑞尔·阿米塔最近屡进戒毒所
Mariel Armitage has been in rehab several times recently,

729
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,810
全部由她亲爱的外甥女夏洛特买单
all paid for by her loving niece, Charlotte.

730
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,040
大家都以为卡罗琳
Now, everybody thought Carolyn was angry

731
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,910
是气斯威尼乱花钱
about the money Sweeney had been spending.

732
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,130
但或许她真正气的是夏洛特
Maybe she was really angry at Charlotte.

733
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,350
我跟我妈妈的关系?
My relationship with my mother?

734
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,510
她是我的挚友
She was my best friend.

735
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,620
你能告诉我蕾马特是什么吗
And can you tell me what Renmart is?

736
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:11,750
法官大人  我想我得提出反对
Your honor, I think I might have to object here.

737
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,920
这问题与本案无关
my only concern is relevance.

738
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:17,060
科里  不是让你给门轴上点润滑油吗
Cory, I thought we were gonna get some WD-40 on those hinges.

739
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:19,560
反对无效
Overruled.

740
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,100
法官大人
Your honor...

741
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,770
我说了  反对无效
I said, overruled.

742
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:24,330
蕾马特是什么
So, what is Renmart?

743
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:27,100
那是我几年前成立的一家公司
It was a company I started a few years ago.

744
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,370
我住在农场里
I live on a farm.

745
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:31,480
计划自产自销有机果酱和果冻
I was going to market a line of organic jams and jellies.

746
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,330
你从家庭信托中取了一大笔钱
And you withdrew a fair amount of money

747
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:37,510
来投资这个水果站  是吗
from the family trust to fund this fruit stand, didn't you?

748
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:39,860
我妈妈首肯的
My mother okayed that.

749
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,300
你妈妈消失后  
But even after your mother disappeared,

750
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,930
你还是继续提款  是这样吗
you continued withdrawing money, isn't that correct?

751
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:46,660
然而你从未生产出一罐果酱
Yet you never produced a single jar of jam.

752
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:49,200
你的公司没有实际地址  
Your company has no physical address,

753
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,900
只有一个租用信箱
except a P.O. Box.

754
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,380
也没有实际的财产  
No assets except a bank account

755
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,570
只有一个活期账户
that you can access any time you'd like.

756
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:58,050
反对  法官大人
Objection... Your honor.

757
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:59,510
反对理由是?
On what grounds?

758
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,540
让我查查看
Let me look here.

759
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,470
好吧  你查你的
Yeah, well, while you're looking,

760
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,670
反对无效
overruled.

761
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,630
你把钱寄给在戒毒的小姨
You were sending money away to your aunt in rehab,

762
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,940
但你不想让你妈妈知道
and you didn't want your mother to know.

763
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,910
不是这样的
That is not true.

764
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,740
卡罗琳知道你这么做吗
So Carolyn was aware you were doing this?

765
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,040
不知道  不是
No... I mean...

766
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,580
一开始不知道  但
No, not-not at first, but...

767
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,850
但后来她发现了  很生气?
And when she found out, she was angry?

768
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,020
厩腐蝇
Muscina stabulans.

769
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,360
一种蛆?
A maggot?

770
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,130
不是普通的蛆
Not just any maggot.

771
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:35,490
它通常寄居在乡下的牲畜身上  
This little fellow is usually found in rural areas, often near livestock,

772
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:39,170
但这条却被埋在斯威尼原来的院子里
but this was buried in the courtyard of Sweeney's old apartment.

773
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,540
真正奇怪的是  它居然还在遗骸上
What's even more unusual is that it's here at all.

774
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:44,260
尸体上有蛆  不是很正常吗
Why wouldn't a maggot be found on a corpse?

775
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,410
有肉吃  它才待得住
Oh, it would, as long as there was flesh to eat.

776
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:49,950
但时隔两年  本不该有残留的人体组织
But after two years, I'd expect to find a clean skull.

777
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:53,750
头颅上还残留着大量人体组织 
A head with so much tissue still preserved suggests

778
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:58,290
说明土壤中有污染物  通常是铅或砷
contaminants in the soil-- usually lead or arsenic.

779
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,210
砷原本被用于杀虫剂  是吧
Arsenic was used in pesticides, right?

780
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,860
70年代才被禁止
Until they banned it in the 1970s.

781
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,910
但若在被禁前使用过含砷杀虫剂
But if it was used before that,

782
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:08,830
土壤中仍然会残留污染物
there'd still be concentrations of it in the soil.

783
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:11,800
而农场上会使用这种杀虫剂  对吧
Pesticides like those used on a farm?

784
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,970
或许吧  怎么了
Maybe. Why?

785
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:18,970
猜猜谁住在乡下农场  又近牲畜
Guess who lives on a farm in a rural area, near livestock?

786
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,840
别告诉我  你就是凶手
Don't tell me. You're the killer.

787
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:24,110
谢谢  李  你帅呆了
Thanks, Li. You're a prince.

788
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,500
正义(狗名)  过来
Justice! Come here.

789
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:29,800
你真是
Oh! You...

790
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,970
天啊
Oh, god.

791
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,730
有发现
Found something!

792
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,900
卡罗琳·阿米塔尸体的其余部分
The rest of Carolyn Armitage's remains were discovered

793
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:53,140
在其女夏洛特的农场院子里被挖出
buried behind the new Caledonia farm of Charlotte Armitage, her daughter.

794
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:56,170
夏洛特被当场拘捕
Arrested at the scene was Charlotte Armitage.

795
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:58,480
你们不懂吗  他陷害我
Don't you see?! He set me up!

796
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,980
我没有...  不是我干的
I didn't... I didn't do this!

797
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,710
他栽赃嫁祸
He put her body here!

798
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,640
他谋财害命
He killed her for her money!

799
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,780
他陷害我  不是我干的
He set me up! I didn't do it!

800
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,710
你们  你们看不出来吗
Don't you... Don't you see?!

801
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:21,320
给我们一点时间  好吗
Give us a moment, okay?

802
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,240
-鸡肉三明治?  -不用
- Chicken sandwich? - No.

803
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,830
我跟你做个交易
I have an offer to make.

804
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:37,620
洗耳恭听
I can't wait.

805
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,410
明天你可以回家  获得自由
Tomorrow, you can go home, free.

806
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:43,110
我会以人道主义理由提请释放你
I'll argue for your release on humanitarian grounds.

807
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,640
你应该跟家人团聚
You should be home with your family.

808
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,840
为什么帮我
Why would you do that?

809
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:48,580
因为我是一名人道主义者
Because I'm a humanitarian.

810
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:52,220
交换条件是什么
What's the catch?

811
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,190
这算不上交换条件
The catch is hardly worthy of its name.

812
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:57,050
让罪名成立
The conviction stands.

813
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,710
你心知肚明  你的确拒绝起诉那几个案子
You know you DP'd those cases, Peter.

814
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,790
现在只有我和你
Now, it's just you and I here.

815
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,130
我们可以坦诚相对
We can admit our feelings to each other.

816
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:06,260
-你想让我承认有罪?  -对
- You want me to let the guilty verdict stand? - Yes.

817
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,500
候审时间折抵刑期  你明天就能回家
with time served, you'd go home tomorrow.

818
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,240
-我的律师资格无法恢复?  -对
- And my disbarment stands? - Yes.

819
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,770
我再也不能做你的竞选对手?
And I can never run against you?

820
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:14,460
不错
That's right.

821
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,520
你没有机会  彼得  你知道的
You have no chance, Peter. You realize that.

822
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,780
如果我没有机会  你来干嘛
If I have no chance, what are you doing here?

823
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,480
好吧  你听我说
Okay, you know what?

824
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,220
总有一天  我们得放下冤仇
At a certain point, this has to move beyond retribution.

825
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,250
我们俩都是
For both of us.

826
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,780
你得考虑一下你的家人
You have to think about your family

827
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:27,790
或者冒险上诉
or risk a failed appeal

828
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:29,090
然后在牢里多呆九年
and another nine years in prison,

829
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:30,560
出狱时你该几岁了  彼得
and how old will you be then, Peter?

830
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,100
你的小孩又几岁了
How old will your kids be?

831
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:36,180
生日派对  男朋友  大学毕业
Birthday parties, boyfriends, college graduations--

832
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,610
都在你坐牢时一一错过
While you were in prison.

833
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:40,780
你在牢中逐渐老朽  而生活仍在继续
A life lived while you grow old in prison.

834
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:43,830
你选吧  彼得  是明天就回家
Now, that's the deal, Peter, go home tomorrow

835
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:47,470
还是冒再受9年牢狱之苦的险
or risk nine more years in prison. Hmm?

836
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,010
你好好想想吧
You think about it.

837
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:59,250
你拿走吧
I need you to take it.

838
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:04,130
我觉得  不自在
I don't feel... comfortable anymore.

839
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:06,570
锻炼一下就好了
You can be made to feel comfortable.

840
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,570
不用了
I don't think so.

841
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,160
你害怕枪
You're scared of it?

842
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,960
不  
No.

843
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:20,200
我开始喜欢
I'm liking it.

844
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,500
-我先帮你保管  -不
- I'll hold it for you. - No.

845
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:24,610
我不会改变主意
I'm not going to change my mind.

846
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,830
我会把账单寄给你
I'll send you my bill.

847
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:28,880
正合我意
I expect no less.

848
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:46,380
福瑞克夫人  我给你带了礼物
Mrs. Florrick. I brought you something.

849
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,870
聊表敬意
A token of my esteem.

850
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:01,450
我觉得  不知为何  它异常适合你
I thought it, somehow, strangely appropriate for you.

851
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,060
是你干的  对吧
You did it, didn't you?

852
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,490
我干了什么
Did what?

853
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:08,760
杀了她  你妻子
Killed her. Your wife.

854
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:11,860
然后把她埋在夏洛特的院子里
And then you buried her in Charlotte's yard.

855
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,170
如果我栽赃
If I did that,

856
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:17,170
为何偏偏把头骨留在自己院子里
why would I leave the skull in my yard?

857
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:18,570
为了把我们引向夏洛特
To point us to Charlotte.

858
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:21,070
你太多疑了  福瑞克夫人
You're being paranoid, Mrs. Florrick.

859
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:23,570
有时候事情真相就和表面一样
Sometimes things are as they seem.

860
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:26,710
不可能的事
The unlikely maneuver is exactly that--

861
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:27,790
就是不可能
Unlikely.

862
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,920
我要走了
I have to go.

863
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,480
恭喜你
Congratulations.

864
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:39,790
你需要信任别人
You just have to trust people.

865
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,590
希望你喜欢这幅画
Enjoy the picture.
