1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,070
It's saturday night.What do you want to do?

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,410
My friend bennett's band is playing a show.We can just go down...

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,110
Just stay home is probably best.

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,640
Well,it's saturday night.What do you want to do?

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,510
The jassers are having a party tonight at that new club in soho.

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,520
That's perfect.After the week I've had,I need to get a little crazy.

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,970
So let's do it.It's been a while since we've had one of our famous wild nights out.

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,200
Yeah,we'll have a few cocktails...

9
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,090
- Do some dancing... - Listen to some...Very loud music...

10
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:37,100
- Pay $15 for a drink... - Feel super old.

11
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,210
I'll call and tell them we're both sick.

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,400
I'm putting on comfortable pants!

13
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,630
Well,it's saturday night.What do you want to do?

14
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,250
Joel,it's wednesday afternoon.

15
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,750
Well,either way,i'm gonna take a nap.

20
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,900
Everybody drink.

21
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,970
Is that not what we're doing?

22
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,600
He'd better get here soon.Ben and I have trivia at connelly's tonight.

23
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,680
And tonight's the night we finally win.

24
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,250
- I can feel it! - Yes!

25
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,910
What's up,$25 bennigan's gift card?

26
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,720
I can't wait to spend you.

27
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:33,800
Here's some interesting trivia.

28
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,920
You guys have been playing there for four years,and you've never won.

29
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,460
That's not true.We just won.

30
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,720
That was two easters ago,and that's just because you're the only two people who go to a bar on easter.

31
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,960
A win's a win.

32
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,720
Yeah,well,casey better get here soon,'cause we only have an hour.

33
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,520
Well,I'm actually okay with casey's lateness,

34
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,300
mostly because his reasons for being late are always so entertaining,

35
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,270
like,"sorry. I had to fill in at a kid's lemonade stand while he peed"

36
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,590
"sorry. I fell down a manhole,so I did some exploring."

37
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,810
And you can never predict what it's gonna be.

38
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,380
Sorry I'm late.I was practicing doing flips.

39
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,930
I might be the mascot for the wnba team the new york liberty.

40
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,230
See?He never disappoints.

41
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,670
You know,my half brother is a professional mascot.

42
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,780
He was the phillie phanatic,the mariner moose,the bunny on the street who points the way to the discount condos.

43
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,960
yeah.

44
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,860
Well,right now he's the mascot for the new york liberty,

45
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,660
but he quit because he just got elected to congress in vermont.

46
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,570
He suggested me to replace him.

47
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,740
Well,at least we know vermont's in good hands.

48
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,180
I am so excited.I've watched my brother's games my whole life.

49
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:36,180
Every little boy goes to the stadium and dreams of one day playing professional mascot.

50
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,970
It's a dream as old as time.

51
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,490
That's awesome.You're gonna be a great mascot,baby.

52
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,980
I think it'll be good for our son to see me go to work every day.

53
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,480
I made this cool decision.Really makes me feel like a dad.

54
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,510
All the money I make,I'm gonna put into a college fund for my little buddy.

55
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,220
really?That's so sweet.

56
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,370
I have an interview tomorrow with the head of marketing.

57
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,880
Man!I can't believe I might get to be maddie!

58
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,620
I-I'm sorry.Maddie?

59
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,840
Weird,right?Your name is also the name of the liberty's mascot.

60
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,590
Why in the world would the mascot be named maddie?

61
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,730
It's named after madison square garden,where they play.

62
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,990
That's funny.It's named after the same thing you are.

63
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,250
I'm named after madison square garden?

64
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,600
We are pretty sure you were conceived in the bathroom at a paul mccartney concert.

65
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,000
Well,another night of trivia,and another loss.

66
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,560
I can't believe that you thought socrates was the father of modern medicine.

67
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,120
Well,at least I gave an answer.You completely choked!

68
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,970
I did not!

69
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,660
That is how I think.

70
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:41,020
And besides,literature is supposed to be one of your categories!

71
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:44,220
if we're gonna keep doing trivia night,then you've got to do better!

72
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,580
We've lost to that smug tom and cynthia four times straight now.

73
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,300
and their trivia team name isn't even clever.

74
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,090
"taking care of quizness"?! What is that?

75
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,110
You know,I am getting sick of losing all the time.

76
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,530
You need to start studying.

77
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,530
You know I don't do that.

78
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,110
When it comes to trivia,I just go with my gut.

79
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,350
well,then your gut's got a seventh grade education.

80
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,130
Studying hasn't helped you.

81
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,000
One of your categories is sports,and you said there are 11 people on a bobsled team.

82
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,650
They said "bobsled," not "bob-bus"!

83
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,970
You try counting the people in a tiny car going 100 miles per hour!

84
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,570
And why do you get all the fun subjects like movies,music,and sports...

85
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,540
And I get science,philosophy,and literature?

86
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:22,560
I have hard stuff,too.

87
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,200
- Yeah! - The '80s!

88
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,080
Okay,do you see how much vh1 I watch?

89
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,440
i'm not doing that for fun,okay?

90
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,620
I'm doing that for us,for the "quizards of oz"!

91
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,470
How'd the mascot interview go?

92
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,080
i'm on my way there now,but I want something to show I'm fun.

93
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,890
can I borrow one of your joke ties?

94
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,740
Yeah,I told him you had a collection of really lame ties.

95
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,090
No.No,I...

96
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,520
I do have a small but exclusive collection of humorous and clever ties.

97
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,090
Might that be what you're referring to?

98
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,160
I just want to wear something fun,like-like maddie.

99
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,760
Thank you.

100
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,310
No,the mascot maddie.

101
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,000
That's gonna happen a lot,isn't it?

102
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,650
my humorous ties are in the top drawer,

103
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,950
but I'm gonna warn you ahead of time,they're not just funny.

104
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,310
Some of them hold a mirror up to society,and one of them's just a mirror.

105
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,310
I hope casey gets this job.

106
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:21,750
He wants it so badly,and it would be so great for him to do something he really loves.

107
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,760
Doesn't he love his band?

108
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,790
Yeah,we're trying to phase that out.

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,210
And how sweet is it that he wants to put money aside for the baby's college fund?

110
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,080
It's kind of a blessing sterv got into politics.

111
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,630
I'm sorry.Sterv?

112
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,800
Yeah,that's his half brother's name.

113
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,310
His dad used to drink a lot.

114
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,340
Some of the kids he had during that time have some crazy names

115
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:43,860
Plaull,dram,and one whose name is just consonants-grnlm.

116
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:47,130
Ladies and gentlemen,ahem,we have a weiner.

117
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,750
You know who loves this tie?

118
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,560
- Hot dog vendors? - Hot dog vendors.

119
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,240
can I borrow a jacket,too?

120
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,720
It's colder out than I thought it would be.

121
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,780
Yeah,sure.

122
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:02,170
maddie,to prepare for sunday,I made up a bunch of trivia flash cards for us to practice.

123
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,070
I don't need practice.

124
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,700
really?

125
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,140
What is the fifth element on the periodic table?

126
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,300
My maddie gut says boron.

127
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,550
Well,whatever.You still need to practice.

128
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,240
Mia,hit me with a music question.

129
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:16,540
Okay.

130
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,140
- Bye,guys! - Bye,honey!You're gonna do great!

131
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,950
Okay.Ben...Who sang "i want it that way"?

132
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,590
please.Backstreet boys.

133
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,370
If you wanna hit me with boy band questions,I can go all night.

134
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,970
Okay.Who sang the theme song to "st. Elmo's fire"?

135
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,650
You know,that's enough for tonight.My brain is tired.

136
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,340
- The box is open! - What?

137
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,320
- The box we put the jacket in,and it's gone. - No.

138
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,410
Oh,my god.

139
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,710
Casey just left the house wearing the unlucky leather jacket!

140
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,870
He's going to a job interview wearing the jacket that every one of us has had the worst day of our lives in.

141
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,640
<i>Seven Years Earlier</i>

142
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,300
Is this gonna be on the news?

143
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,080
Okay.

144
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,410
How is the cold snap affecting my day?

145
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,760
Well,I always have a plan.

146
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,970
Listen up and take notes,new york.I go cozy.

147
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,310
First a sturdy leather jacket...

148
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,080
A bee.Anyway...

149
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,420
bees.

150
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,850
Stinging!Stinging.

151
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,960
And I had to get my driver's license photo that day.

152
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,850
You think that's bad?What happened to me was even worse.

153
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,940
You know how sometimes i'm walking down the street and people yell at me and try to spit on me?

154
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,270
Sure.

155
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,370
<i>Two Years Earlier</i>

156
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,900
It was the top of the 9th,and the yankees were one out away from making the playoffs.

157
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,090
Maddie had gone for food,and when she came back,i had to move stuff to make room.

158
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,010
That's when I knocked my blanket over the wall right onto nick swisher.

159
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:58,670
You're on the tv! You're on the big tv!

160
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:05,150
The yankees lost,and I was about to become the most hated man in new york city.

161
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,790
Well,they're not taking that camera off me.

162
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,390
This is the best night of my life!

163
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,370
we've got to stop casey.

164
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,960
We can't let him go into that interview wearing the unlucky leather jacket.

165
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,230
He could explode or something.

166
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,530
darlin'.

167
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,610
Take off that jacket.

168
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,820
baby,I-I don't have time to play that game now.

169
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,310
I gotta focus on the interview.

170
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,590
The jacket-it's unlucky!

171
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,400
You cannot wear it to the interview!

172
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,030
Unlucky?Jackets can't be unlucky.

173
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,020
This one is,okay?

174
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,330
Ben had the worst day of his life in it,and so did maddie!

175
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,840
And the only time I wore it,I did,too,okay?

176
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,370
I was working at klarik's department store,setting up window displays,

177
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,700
and then the weirdest thing happened.

178
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,860
Out of nowhere,I suddenly got tired,so I sat down for a second...

179
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,140
<i>One Years Earlier</i>

180
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,590
When I woke up,the store was closed,and I was locked in.

181
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,090
At first,people just thought it was funny.

182
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,970
I'm locked in here.

183
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,130
Can you guys call for help?

184
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,060
What?What?Are you kidding me?

185
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,690
Just...

186
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,320
Then a few hours later,the teenagers figured out I was there.

187
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,890
Burger boobs.Yeah,very funny,guys.

188
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,960
yeah.That's hilarious.

189
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,440
But it got worse when the bars let out.

190
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,290
That's when the real weirdos showed up.

191
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,540
Nice try.I saw better two flashers ago.

192
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:32,280
And then I saw a guy I was dating with his arm around another girl,

193
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,990
and then he grabbed her ass.He never grabbed my ass!

194
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,760
Mia,those are just coincidences.

195
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,470
There's no such thing as good luck or bad luck.You make your own luck.

196
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,320
Not with this jacket.

197
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,700
It's evil.It's possessed.Take it off right now!

198
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,240
No,I like it.It's comfy.

199
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,460
of course it is.

200
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,420
That's how it gets you.

201
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,370
I-I gotta go.I'll call you after the interview.Love you.

202
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,460
Casey does not understand that the jacket is unlucky.

203
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,910
He said he doesn't believe in luck!

204
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,060
That's just gonna make the jacket even madder.

205
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,320
We have got to go save him.

206
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,410
Do you even know where the interview is?

207
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,800
Well,it's gotta be at their headquarters,right?

208
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,510
I'll go look it up.

209
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,350
- kids. - Mom,dad...

210
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,630
The jacket is out in the world.

211
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,800
The unlucky leather jacket?Oh,no!

212
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,790
Yeah.Casey is wearing it.

213
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,930
What the hell happened?

214
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,480
It was in a box at the back of the closet under some old shoes.

215
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,150
He must've found it.

216
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,500
We should've thrown that jacket away when we had the chance.

217
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,340
Why didn't you?

218
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:31,320
Because they gave it to me as a birthday present.

219
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,710
You are very hard to buy for.

220
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,330
And at the time,we didn't know how bad it was.

221
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,200
I thought I'd never see that jacket again.

Hello.

00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,880
Excuse me.That's my $100.

225
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,210
My ass.It's under my shoe.It's my $100.

226
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,590
Well,I saw it first.

227
00:10:58,690 --> 00:10:59,960
Well,I stepped on it first.

228
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:04,010
yeah,because that's the expression "steppers keepers."

229

Bye,baby.

230
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:12,090
Okay.I know what this must look like,but I was not soliciting a prostitute.

231
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,440
You have to believe me.There was a $100 bill on the ground.

232
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,810
We both just picked it up.That's it.I don't even want it.

233
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,570
Here,you take the $100,this whole thing goes away.No problem.

234
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:21,330
Okay,I know what that sounded like,but I was not bribing a police officer.

235
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,300
Believe me.I would never do that.

236
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,950
I would rather solicit a prostitute than bribe a police officer!

He must've turned it off when he went into the interview.

He has to show them that he can do a flip.

251

What if he does it in the leather jacket?

252
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,740
He could break every bone in his body!

253

Maddie,do you know how many bones are in the human body?

254

No,no.Yeah,everything's fine.It's not that important.

You were saying you thought it was gonna work out.We just need to

295
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,680
I'm sorry.I just I-I need my jacket back.

- Not now! - Okay,what in the world is the problem?

The zipper is stuck. I can't get it off.

All right.Yank it over his head!

Told you it was unlucky.

305
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,690
I can't believe it.I had the job,and then...

306
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:16,950
The jacket took it away.

307
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,660
No,you took it away.You all took it away when you burst in.

308
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:25,000
Did we burst in,or were we just pawns in the jacket's game?

309
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,130
You guys are insane.

310
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,700
Insanely afraid of the jacket,yes.

311
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,780
I lost that job because of you.

312
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:32,800
Because of the jacket.

313
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,330
- Because of you. - Or was it the jacket?

314
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,800
it was you!

315
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:39,370
The jacket is making him say these things.

316
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,410
How about this?

317
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,680
Let's just get rid of the jacket,because it is making you all act like lunatics!

318
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,200
That woman was about to give me the job.

319
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,580
You came in.You ruined it!

320
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,360
You're like that crazy family from the greek movie.

321
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,770
The...What is it called?

322
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,530
"my big fat greek wedding."2002.

323
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,960
Nia vardalos and that guy from "northern exposure."

324
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,950
ben.I don't ever want to do trivia without you.

325
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,350
- Me,neither. - You're the best.

326
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,790
No,I'm sorry.That's the wrong answer,because you're the best.

327
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:08,620
yes!And the crowd goes wild!

328
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,730
A sound I will never hear now that you crushed my dream.

329
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,410
honey.You have tons more dreams we haven't crushed yet.

330
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,750
Well,we have got to get rid of that jacket.

331
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,980
Let's give it to a hobo.

332
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,210
They have such bad luck,they probably wouldn't even notice.

333
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,920
I think I know how we can get rid of that jacket.

334
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,630
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

335
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,740
yes.

336
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,110
No.What?

337
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:43,160
I was thinking you and I have to take care of some...Unfinished quizness.

338
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,920
Nice!

339
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,410
I'm still not following that.

340
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,850
I need a better hint.I'm...

341
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:58,540
Tom,cynthia,before the game starts,ben and I wanted to give you something in the spirit of sportsmanship.

342
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:03,520
It's a leather jacket,and look what we bedazzled on the back.

343
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,130
"taking care of quizness."

344
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,170
It's beautiful.

345
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:09,970
Did you know the bedazzler was the top selling item of 199-'94.Yep.

346
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,270
I knew that.

347
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,700
One of you should wear it,and the other one should touch it,like,constantly.

348
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,150
All right.Well,good luck,you guys.

349
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,080
Okay?

350
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,180
They're gonna need it.

351
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:23,610
Take your time.I love this place.Free refills.

352
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,630
No,honey.That was bennigan's.

353
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,260
This is my fourth.

354
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,250
Casey got the mascot job...After all!

355
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,600
- yay,casey! - Way to go,man.

356
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:34,550
How did that happen?

357
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,480
it was amazing.The woman from the wnba called me back in.

358
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,530
Turns out that jacket is the reason I got the job.

359
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:45,460
Last night when I was home stewing about how you destroyed my office,

360
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:50,530
I was thinking to myself,that's not how a professional person behaves at an interview.

361
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,220
That's how an animal behaves.

362
00:16:53,310 --> 00:17:00,730
That's when I remembered,I was interviewing you for a job to be an animal.

363
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,750
Excuse me?

364
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,390
no.Excuse me.

365
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:11,240
Everyone else who wanted this job came in here in their suits,

366
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,780
and they asked for the job like a civilized person,but not you.

367
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:21,050
No,you came in here in your cool leather jacket,and you-you shattered my trophies...

368
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,430
And my expectations.

369
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:28,110
You didn't ask to be maddie the mascot.

370
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:31,280
You just were...

371
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:34,580
Maddie the mascot.

372
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:43,360
If it hadn't been for that jacket,I never would've gotten the job.

373
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,680
I actually think it's a lucky leather jacket.

374
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,580
Think about it.

375
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,960
When you were locked inside that department store window,you saw your boyfriend with another girl.

376
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:50,970
You broke up with him.

377
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:55,370
If you hadn't,you never would've met me,and that would be someone else's baby.

378
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,460
The jacket works in mysterious ways.

379
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:03,500
Yeah,you know,come to think of it,that officer who arrested me ended up becoming one of my poker buddies...

380
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,810
And he helped me get your mother out of that trumped-up d.u.i. Charge.

381
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,730
I was only going 2 miles per hour.

382
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,460
I didn't even know the car was moving.

383
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,360
That shouldn't even count.

384
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,440
Wait.

385
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,090
Maddie,remember that your face was so covered in bee stings,you refused to leave the apartment.

386
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,250
You just stayed inside for three weeks and studied for the bar exam.

387
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,360
That's right,and I had already failed it twice.

388
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,120
Without the bees,I might not have passed.

389
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,520
I might not even be a lawyer.

390
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,800
And if I hadn't worn that jacket,I never would've met governor pataki.

391
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,990
Okay,it all started when I was going to the gym...

392
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,120
<i>Nine Years Earlier</i>

393
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:37,000
Mom,not now.The quiz is about to start.

394
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,460
Wait.

395
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:43,730
If that jacket is good luck,then we just gave all that good luck to taking care of quizness.

396
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,910
{\a6}<i>Six Months Later</i>

397
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,700
That is correct.I can't believe it!

398
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:51,190
3,000 correct answers in a row!

399
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,860
I mean,you're just humiliating these people over and over.

400
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:55,990
I don't get it.I don't get it.

401
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,120
Everyone else who has worn that jacket has had something good happen,and all I got was the bad.

402
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,780
I don't know.Well,maybe-maybe the yankees thing could've been worse.

403
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,210
Could've been worse?

404
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,650
how could it have been worse?

405
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:09,590
<i>If Ben Hadn't Worn The Jacket</i>

406
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:11,540
What's going on?

407
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,380
Your boyfriend was dancing,and he fell over the side.

408
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,010
I think he's dead,bro.

409
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,630
Dinner,a movie That was a perfect night out.

410
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,390
You know what?I do not want it to end.

411
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,430
I could totally go out and do something else,go to a jazz club-aah!

412
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:36,570
How do you do that?

413
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,600
It's like you're a reverse superman.

414
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,680
What an enlightening night out.

415
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,260
There is nothing like a swedish film all set in one room to make you question what it is to be human.

416
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,440
Yes.

417
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:52,470
I mean,when constable valgo and cousin shterp burst into that cabin to tell the horrigans that...

418
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,870
Grandpa dolph had been thrown into the fjord!

419
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:58,480
Heartbreaking!It really makes you think.
