establish some ground rules.

ugly spooning incident.

00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,670
<font color="#ffff00">It was cold. It's human instinct.

about any human instincts!

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:27,370

there's another fingernail in there?

42
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,370
<font color="#ffff00">The story of how Ben and Maddie
met is,like,the best story ever.
.
.

43
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,750
<font color="#ffff00">They met building houses for
the poor,and my mom and dad...
.
.

44
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,090
<font color="#ffff00">they met chasing the same foul ball at
yankee stadium.There was a huge pileup.
.
.

45
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,870
<font color="#ffff00">When the people cleared away,they
were both left holding the same ball.
.
.

46
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,960

good,and since we're making it up,maybe even better.

.
.

50
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,090

my instincts and I'd never lied.

uncomfortable at that dinner.

least I can control myself.
.
.

55
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,140
<font color="#ffff00">I heard you fainted the first
time you met Maddie's parents.
.
.

56
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,210
<font color="#ffff00">I did not faint!
.
.

57
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,580
<font color="#ffff00">I just fell off my chair and stayed on
the ground for a while because I was tired.

Joel are intimidating.

really only met you three weeks ago.
.
.

.

65
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:59,930

humanity building houses for the poor.
.
.

66
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,620
<font color="#ffff00">Our story has been known
to reduce people to tears.

to change the world.

.

68
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,870

the nails he uses to build the house...
.
.

69
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,730
<font color="#ffff00">It's about us,okay? So Casey
was working as a pedicab driver.
.
.

70
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:23,360
<font color="#ffff00">- neat. Was that a fun job for you?
- Sure was,pumpkin.
.
.

71
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,240
<font color="#ffff00">Casey was taking a passenger on a ride
through the park,and at the same time,
.
.

72
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,780
<font color="#ffff00">I was on a different pedicab
going in the opposite direction,
.
.

73
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,280
<font color="#ffff00">so as our pedicabs passed
each other,our eyes met,
.
.

74
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:40,180
<font color="#ffff00">and the whole world just seemed to
freeze just for a second,and I knew.
.
.

75
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,650
<font color="#ffff00">I just...I knew it.
.
.

76
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:46,770
<font color="#ffff00">And I guess Casey knew,too,because he turned
his pedicab around and chased after me,
.
.

77
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,590
<font color="#ffff00">and as he passed a flower
vendor,he reached out his hand
.
.

78
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:54,490
<font color="#ffff00">and he grabbed a dozen roses to give to
the woman that he had just locked eyes with.
.
.

79
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,740
<font color="#ffff00">Casey.
.
.

80
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:00,470
<font color="#ffff00">Strong move,son. Strong move.
.
.

81
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,740
<font color="#ffff00">So I took the flowers and
walked right up to her...
.
.

82
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,630
<font color="#ffff00">oh,you didn't walk,honey.You
were on a pedicab.
.
.

83
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:11,600
<font color="#ffff00">Right. Right.Is it hot in here,big man?
.
.

84
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,310
<font color="#ffff00">So a huge crowd had gathered,and they all started
cheering and applauding as we had our first kiss,
.
.

85
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,800
<font color="#ffff00">and we've been together ever
since.and there was a puppy.
.
.

86
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:27,190
<font color="#ffff00">- What a wonderful story.
- Certainly worthy of the putney name.
.
.

87
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,480
<font color="#ffff00">It's almost as good as our story.
.
.

88
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,360
<font color="#ffff00">I think it's even better
than Ben and Maddie's story.
.
.

89
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:38,300
<font color="#ffff00">I am so glad we did this tonight.Casey,I
had no idea you were such a romantic.
.
.

90
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,550
<font color="#ffff00">You know what Casey would love?
.
.

91
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,910
<font color="#ffff00">Has Mia told you about
our house on the lake?
.
.

92
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:46,870
<font color="#ffff00">It has got to be the most
romantic place on earth.
.
.

93
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,900
<font color="#ffff00">- We should all go there.
- I'd love to go.
.
.

94
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,470
<font color="#ffff00">- Are you sure there's room for me?
- Of course.
.
.

95
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,310
<font color="#ffff00">You two can take the upstairs room.
.
.

96
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,450
<font color="#ffff00">Maddie and Ben can take the
basement room.They'll be fine.
.
.

97
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,330
<font color="#ffff00">The upstairs bedroom is our room!
.
.

98
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,620
<font color="#ffff00">We've been sleeping in there for nine years,and
now they just give it to Mia and Casey.
.
.

99
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,870
<font color="#ffff00">Why?'Cause of some stupid story where he
stole flowers and knows how to ride a bike?
.
.

100
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:10,430
<font color="#ffff00">And not even a real bike.It has
three wheels,like that's hard.
.
.

101
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,070
<font color="#ffff00">I can't believe we get to
sleep in the upstairs bedroom.
.
.

102
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:16,810
<font color="#ffff00">I knew that story was good,but
I didn't know it was that good!
.
.

103
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,850
<font color="#ffff00">Is it that big a deal?
.
.

104
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,830
<font color="#ffff00">honey,you have no idea.
.
.

105
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,290
<font color="#ffff00">The upstairs room has a
panoramic view of the lake,
.
.

106
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:26,300
<font color="#ffff00">a huge bed with Fluffy pillows
like a hotel,and its own bathroom.
.
.

107
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,960
<font color="#ffff00">Sleeping up there is like
being queen of the lake.
.
.

108
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,190
<font color="#ffff00">And the basement room?
.
.

109
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,960
<font color="#ffff00">It's hell down there.
.
.

110
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,570
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not staying in the room
where they gut the fish.
.
.

111
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:36,530
<font color="#ffff00">Well,they converted it.
.
.

112
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,620
<font color="#ffff00">They didn't convert
it.They put a bed in it.
.
.

113
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,870
<font color="#ffff00">Every time Mia sleeps down there,she smells
like the dumpster behind the Sushi place.
.
.

114
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,880
<font color="#ffff00">- You want a glass of wine?
- Two,please.
.
.

115
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:51,020
<font color="#ffff00">Well,that's it.We're no
longer the number one couple.
.
.

116
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:55,590
<font color="#ffff00">Once they got engaged and pregnant,I knew this
would happen,but I thought we had more time!
.
.

117
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,680
<font color="#ffff00">All right. Let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

is my job to read people,

<font color="#ffff00">So what are we gonna do?
.
.

234
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,100
<font color="#ffff00">Nothing,because we both
can destroy each other.
.
.

235
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,450
<font color="#ffff00">Well,what about the upstairs bedroom?
.
.

236
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,190
<font color="#ffff00">We split it.You guys get
holidays,and we get weekends.
.
.

237
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,910
<font color="#ffff00">And we flip a coin for
the cranberry festival.
.
.

238
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,540
<font color="#ffff00">Okay. You know what is funny?
.
.

239
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,210
<font color="#ffff00">The only reason I lied is because your
story is so good and ours is so embarrassing.
.
.

240
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:47,830
<font color="#ffff00">Our story is really
embarrassing.That's why I lied.
.
.

241
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:53,070
<font color="#ffff00">some advice from someone who's
been lying for nine years.
.
.

242
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,840
<font color="#ffff00">The thing is,you gotta stay on Casey.
.
.

243
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,850
<font color="#ffff00">To be honest,he didn't really tell it
that great at dinner the other night.
.
.

244
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,590
<font color="#ffff00">Okay.
.
.

245
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:01,400
<font color="#ffff00">You gotta get this down,'cause this is a lie
you're gonna be telling for the rest of your lives.
.
.

246
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,150
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know if Casey can do that.
.
.

247
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:07,870
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sweating like crazy.I called their
dad "snack time." I'm out of control!
.
.

248
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,430
<font color="#ffff00">And what about our baby? Are
we supposed to lie to our baby?
.
.

249
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:17,040
<font color="#ffff00">yeah.You lie to your baby.
You lie to everyone. Forever.
.
.

250
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,140
<font color="#ffff00">- No.
- What?
.
.

251
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,400
<font color="#ffff00">No,I...I can't do it.
.
.

252
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:27,720
<font color="#ffff00">Casey.Casey,come here.We're
gonna tell the truth.
.
.

253
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,300
<font color="#ffff00">Really?
.
.

254
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,520
<font color="#ffff00">We should've told the truth
from the beginning,but I just...
.
.

255
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,660
<font color="#ffff00">I got so caught up in what
mom and dad would think
.
.

256
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,920
<font color="#ffff00">and having a better story than Ben
and maddie,but none of that matters.
.
.

257
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:41,590
<font color="#ffff00">All that matters is me and you and
the baby.We can't lie to our baby.
.
.

258
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,400
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you,Mia.Oh,my God. Mia.
.
.

259
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,050
<font color="#ffff00">I just called you Mia without
adding a stupid nickname.I'm back!
.
.

260
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,710
<font color="#ffff00">Yes!
.
.

261
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,310
<font color="#ffff00">Excuse me.I mean,what are you doing
anyway? There's not even music.
.
.

262
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,330
<font color="#ffff00">Hi,everyone.
.
.

263
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:07,340
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sure many of you,think that you know the
story about how Casey and I met,but,that was a lie.
.
.

264
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:11,110
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sorry,mom and dad,but Casey
and I met in the emergency room.
.
.

265
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,780
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah,well,I started the
night at a male strip joint...
.
.

266
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,490
<font color="#ffff00">Where I was watching a wet briefs
contest...That I was judging.
.
.

267
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,810
<font color="#ffff00">Boy,she just went on and on.
.
.

268
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,400
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah,that's one of those stories
where you really just need the gist.
.
.

269
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,140
<font color="#ffff00">Although it was nice to hear that the judges
at those things take their job seriously.
.
.

270
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:34,180
<font color="#ffff00">Makes that hot bod trophy I won
in Daytona mean that much more.
.
.

271
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:37,390
<font color="#ffff00">Is that what that bronzed
thong on your mantel is about?
.
.

272
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,980
<font color="#ffff00">No.
.
.

273
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,210
<font color="#ffff00">And as I made my way over
to congratulate the winner,
.
.

274
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:48,570
<font color="#ffff00">a very talented dancer named Apollo
13,I slipped on a pair of his wet briefs.
.
.

275
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,350
<font color="#ffff00">I fell,hit my head,and I woke up
in the hospital with a concussion...
.
.

276
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,340
<font color="#ffff00">And,well...That's when I saw Casey.
.
.

277
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:00,590
<font color="#ffff00">I was already at the hospital,because
Dave,one of the bassists in our band...
.
.

278
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,730
<font color="#ffff00">we have seven...
.
.

279
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,880
<font color="#ffff00">decided we should Pierce our nipples.
.
.

280
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:12,040
<font color="#ffff00">He has really long hair,so when he was trying
to Pierce mine,his hair got stuck in the hole.
.
.

281
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,260
<font color="#ffff00">You went into a lot of detail,too.
.
.

282
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:17,430
<font color="#ffff00">Well,it freaked me out.His hair got all wrapped
in there,and he wouldn't cut it,because...
.
.

283
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,570
<font color="#ffff00">you're doing it again.
.
.

284
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,590
<font color="#ffff00">Well,it started to ooze.
.
.

285
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,060
<font color="#ffff00">All right. You know what? I'd
rather hear erotic stories.
.
.

286
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,140
<font color="#ffff00">No!
.
.

287
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,620
<font color="#ffff00">So we went to the hospital.
.
.

288
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:36,720
<font color="#ffff00">I heard what was going on in the room next to
mine,so after Dave was removed... From me...
.
.

289
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:45,440
<font color="#ffff00">I walked over,and there was Mia.She
was so beautiful and all alone...
.
.

290
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,370
<font color="#ffff00">So I took her hand,and I told
her that I'd stay with her.
.
.

291
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:53,420
<font color="#ffff00">And he did,and we've
been together ever since.
.
.

292
00:16:53,810 --> 00:17:00,810
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe it's not as good as the pedicab story,but
we realized that,well,it doesn't matter how we met.
.
.

293
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,480
<font color="#ffff00">What matters is that we did.
.
.

294
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,490
<font color="#ffff00">That was a weirdly sweet moment.
.
.

295
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,430
<font color="#ffff00">Right up until maddie ruined it.
.
.

296
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,460
<font color="#ffff00">What Mia just said is
so true,even for us.
.
.

297
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:16,210
<font color="#ffff00">It doesn't matter how we
met,Ben,it just matters that we met.
.
.

298
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,970
<font color="#ffff00">No,that is not true.No. Not
if you met the way we did.
.
.

299
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,920
<font color="#ffff00">No,we have to tell the truth,too.
.
.

300
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,840
<font color="#ffff00">I-I can see why you would say that.
.
.

301
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,840
<font color="#ffff00">You're caught up,and your eyes have that glassy look
that tell me you're not gonna listen to anything I say.
.
.

302
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:31,750
<font color="#ffff00">Great idea,Ben.Let's tell
everyone the truth right now.
.
.

303
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,400
<font color="#ffff00">Their story ended
romantically.Ours does not.
.
.

304
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,730
<font color="#ffff00">Let's just take a beat
and think about this for...
.
.

305
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,850
<font color="#ffff00">- everyone!Okay.
- Or just start talking.
.
.

306
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:43,330
<font color="#ffff00">How about that Mia and Casey,huh?
.
.

307
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:54,920
<font color="#ffff00">in this new spirit of honesty and confessions
without repercussions,I also have something to say.
.
.

308
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:01,420
<font color="#ffff00">Ben and I did not meet
building houses for poor people.
.
.

309
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,810
<font color="#ffff00">I was camping and partying in
the woods with a bunch of friends.
.
.

310
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:10,630
<font color="#ffff00">I was at that wonderful age before
you realize that camping is stupid...
.
.

311
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:16,480
<font color="#ffff00">And I got up in the middle of the night
to pee,so I stumbled through the forest.
.
.

312
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,140
<font color="#ffff00">Now in my defense,I was super drunk...
.
.

313
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:26,660
<font color="#ffff00">And I went to pee on this rock,but
guess what? It wasn't a rock.
.
.

314
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,170
<font color="#ffff00">It was Ben.
.
.

315
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:35,190
<font color="#ffff00">And ever since that speech,we've
been stuck in the fish gutting room.
.
.

316
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,360
<font color="#ffff00">Why do the girls get
the good room again?
.
.

317
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,450
<font color="#ffff00">Casey.
.
.

318
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:44,610
<font color="#ffff00">Relationships are a chess
game.Now,sure,we've made a sacrifice.
.
.

319
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,060
<font color="#ffff00">We gave up our horsey
piece and the tall one.
.
.

320
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,360
<font color="#ffff00">You don't play chess,do you?
.
.

321
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:54,210
<font color="#ffff00">No,not even once,but I do
know that we've won this round,
.
.

322
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:59,070
<font color="#ffff00">because I guarantee you,those
girls are feeling really guilty.
.
.

323
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,830
<font color="#ffff00">Nice.
.
.

324
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,410
<font color="#ffff00">I love being queen of the lake.
.
.

325
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,680
<font color="#ffff00">Me,too.
.
.

326
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:11,080
<font color="#ffff00">And as your co-queen,I can't believe
we didn't think of this years ago.
.
.

327
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,720
<font color="#ffff00">It's so hot in here.
.
.

328
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:21,700
<font color="#ffff00">Keep your shirt
on,Tarzan.We made a deal.
.
.

329
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:26,220
<font color="#ffff00">You know,if Vicky and Joel didn't have
such an amazing "how we met" story,
.
.

330
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,950
<font color="#ffff00">then none of this would've happened.
.
.

331
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:34,410
<font color="#ffff00">I feel bad that the kids still believe we met
at yankee stadium both reaching for a foul ball.
.
.

332
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,240
<font color="#ffff00">Should we have told
them how we really met?
.
.

333
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:40,140
<font color="#ffff00">No.Of course not.
