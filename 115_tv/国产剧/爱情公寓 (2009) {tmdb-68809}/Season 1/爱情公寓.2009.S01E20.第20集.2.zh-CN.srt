I won't have to hear it.

Sit down. All right.

14
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,050
<font color="#ffff00">you open your mouth,and then I put my mouth
over your nose and blow in a little bit.

- Some guy at work did it to me.
.

19
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,560
<font color="#ffff00">Did the guy at work use his tongue,too?

20
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,890
<font color="#ffff00">That was special for you,baby.

<font color="#ffff00">and-and when you're there,please
just tell her the dress looks great.
.

23
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,530
<font color="#ffff00">That way we won't have to have it
altered again.  That saves everyone money.

.
.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,370
<font color="#ffff00">Well,it is hard to think of something nice
to say about how a pregnant bride looks.
.
.

27
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,710
<font color="#ffff00">Sometimes I can be a little too honest.
.
.

28
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:09,260
<font color="#ffff00">You mean like when you told me,"you're in a
battle with puberty,and you're not winning"?
.
.

00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,900

00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,650
<font color="#ffff00">All right.Well,wish us luck.
.
.

32
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:25,460
<font color="#ffff00">The last fitting was not fun.The dress
was tight,and she took it so hard.
.
.

33
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,950
<font color="#ffff00">I felt terrible for
her... And for the zipper.
.
.

34
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,490
<font color="#ffff00">It was like someone was trying to force
a confession out of that poor thing.
.
.

35
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,100
<font color="#ffff00">Ben,since you're here,would you mind
if I ran my wedding toast by you?
.
.

36
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,060
<font color="#ffff00">That's okay.You know,I'm gonna hear it
on the day,and that's enough,I think.
.
.

37
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,120
<font color="#ffff00">I look at you tonight,and I'm overjoyed.
.
.

38
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,830
<font color="#ffff00">why,thank you,joel.
.
.

39
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,950
<font color="#ffff00">Mia,as a father,sometimes it's hard to
remember at life was like before children.
.
.

40
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,380
<font color="#ffff00">My life didn't really start
until you girls were born.
.
.

41
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,590
<font color="#ffff00">Tonight...
.
.

42
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,980
<font color="#ffff00">Is a celebration.
.
.

43
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,640
<font color="#ffff00">My little girl is-is
not so little anymore.
.
.

44
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:09,130
<font color="#ffff00">Honey,I remember the...
First time I held you.
.
.

45
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,870
<font color="#ffff00">I'm just gonna jump in right here.
.
.

46
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,740
<font color="#ffff00">What's going on with those pauses?
.
.

47
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,490
<font color="#ffff00">You noticed that?
.
.

48
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,530
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah,but only because
they're really noticeable.
.
.

49
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:24,620
<font color="#ffff00">Well,I... I'm giving a toast about my
daughter,my-my little girl,on the day of her wedding,
.
.

50
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:28,690
<font color="#ffff00">so I get a little emotional,and I have to do
something to choke those bad feelings down.
.
.

51
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,370
<font color="#ffff00">So you're trying to stop
yourself from crying?
.
.

52
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,180
<font color="#ffff00">Ben,real men don't cry.
.
.

53
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,660
<font color="#ffff00">That's why I take a pause,to
switch over to a more manly emotion.
.
.

54
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,550
<font color="#ffff00">Really? And what emotions
do you consider manly?
.
.

55
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:44,500
<font color="#ffff00">Well,the only acceptable emotions for
a real man are anger,arousal,and itchy.
.
.

56
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,990
<font color="#ffff00">Okay,the compliment i'm gonna give mia
is "you look radiant," so don't take that.
.
.

57
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,690
<font color="#ffff00">Great. I'll just say she's glowing.
.
.

58
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,570
<font color="#ffff00">No way.If I get radiant,then I get
all the ways light reacts off her skin.
.
.

59
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,800
<font color="#ffff00">- Okay. I'm coming now.
- you're gonna look great.
.
.

60
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,410
<font color="#ffff00">Oh,my god.You look radiant!
.
.

61
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,300
<font color="#ffff00">Mia,I don't know what to
say.You actually look incredible.
.
.

62
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,110
<font color="#ffff00">Actually?
.
.

63
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,470
<font color="#ffff00">Come here. I want you to see it.
.
.

64
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,900
<font color="#ffff00">We were prepared to lie,but
now we don't have to.
.
.

65
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:32,480
<font color="#ffff00">Which is great,because I can save those lies
for if your baby comes out not that cute.
.
.

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,900
<font color="#ffff00">I look like a princess...Who met
her prince eight months ago...
.
.

67
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,240
<font color="#ffff00">And did not go home at midnight.
.
.

68
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,190
<font color="#ffff00">You look radiant.
.
.

69
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,540
<font color="#ffff00">it's a dream come true.
.
.

70
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,630
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah.These tailors are magicians.
.
.

71
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:55,570
<font color="#ffff00">I just lost a bunch of weight,and they
were able to take my dress in 2 inches...
.
.

72
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,760
<font color="#ffff00">- And you can't even tell!
- No,I know. They're awesome.
.
.

73
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,440
<font color="#ffff00">Like with myress,you can't even
tell that they let it out 2 inches...
.
.

74
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,050
<font color="#ffff00">And then 5 more inches.
.
.

75
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,770
<font color="#ffff00">Actually,large sections
of my dress are elastic.
.
.

76
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,380
<font color="#ffff00">Well,I just hope I don't burst out
of my dress at the reception when
.
.

77
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,070
<font color="#ffff00">I'm pounding booze and
sushi between dances.
.
.

78
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,470
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah,I will not be doing a lot
of boozin' and sushi eating.
.
.

79
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,790
<font color="#ffff00">Or dancing.
.
.

80
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:26,530
<font color="#ffff00">I'll be doing a lot of peeing... And sweating
and... Knocking things over with my belly.
.
.

81
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,290
<font color="#ffff00">- We should toast.
- Yeah.
.
.

82
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,000
<font color="#ffff00">Okay.
.
.

83
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,080
<font color="#ffff00">can you please get her a water?
She can't drink champagne.
.
.

84
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,630
<font color="#ffff00">That's okay.I'll take hers.
.
.

85
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,410
<font color="#ffff00">Looks like grandma's drinking for two.
.
.

86
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,420
<font color="#ffff00">Actually,mom,I have thought a lot about how
to do the champagne toast at the wedding,
.
.

87
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:45,000
<font color="#ffff00">and I think I've figured out a way to
do it that almost no one will notice.
.
.

88
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,310
<font color="#ffff00">To our big day!
.

90
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,180
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you.You're in a good mood.
.
.

91
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:14,770
<font color="#ffff00">yes,I am...  Because I am
going to make your father cry.
.
.

92
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,110
<font color="#ffff00">What are you talking about?
.
.

93
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:21,850
<font color="#ffff00">Revenge! I am talking about revenge.
.
.

94
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,930
<font color="#ffff00">Do you remember what
he did when bobo died?
.
.

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,200
<font color="#ffff00">What's going on?
.
.

96
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,290
<font color="#ffff00">Bobo,ben's childhood
dog,died last night.
.
.

97
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,920
<font color="#ffff00">Oh,god. He was such a good friend to me.
.
.

98
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,770
<font color="#ffff00">This is ridiculous.Calm
down,tammy tear-ducts. Be a man.
.
.

99
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,060
<font color="#ffff00">You sound like a little
girl who lost her dolly.
.

100
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:53,380
<font color="#ffff00">Today he asked me for help with his toast
for mia's wedding,and as he went through it,

101
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,430
<font color="#ffff00">he got a bit emotional but
successfully fought it off,

do that to my father?
.
.

104
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:09,300
<font color="#ffff00">Yes,I am,and when he cries,I am gonna make
fun of him the way that he made fun of me.

it all the time! He does it to everybody.

little elliott started crying when eddie went home.

we are gonna make that bald man cry!

point and we are going to mock,

<font color="#ffff00">Honey,look,I want our wedding
to be a celebration of us,

that I can take part in,not just watch .
.
.

125
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,850
<font color="#ffff00">Why can't you take part in it?
.
.

126
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,290
<font color="#ffff00">Because I don't want to be scared
that my dress might burst open.
.
.

127
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,360
<font color="#ffff00">- Honey. The elastic is there...
- No,no,no.
.
.

128
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,180
<font color="#ffff00">And I want to swallow the
booze,not just spit it out,okay?
.
.

129
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:52,850
<font color="#ffff00">And I don't want to pee every ten
minutes,and I want to be able to do the worm.
.

130
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,370
<font color="#ffff00">The worm?
.
.

131
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:58,230
<font color="#ffff00">It's a family tradition.At a putney wedding,the
bride always does the worm.Even my mom.
.
.

132
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:06,550
<font color="#ffff00">later tonight,i get
to be that dance floor.
.
.

133
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,850
<font color="#ffff00">Then let's postpone it.
.
.

134
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:14,210
<font color="#ffff00">I want the wedding to be one of
the happiest days of both our lives.
.
.

135
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,670
<font color="#ffff00">We can wait.
.

136
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,460
<font color="#ffff00">honey. Thank you.I
knew you'd understand.
.
.

137
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:22,580
<font color="#ffff00">And how cool is gonna be to have
our little baby at the wedding?
.
.

138
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,340
<font color="#ffff00">What's cuter than a baby ring bearer?

.
.

140
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,310
<font color="#ffff00">Our biggest problem is,we've gotta
figure out a way to tell my dad.

.

141
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,040
<font color="#ffff00">Why? He'll be fine.
.
.

142
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:36,510
<font color="#ffff00">We'll just sit him down and talk to
him about it over a glass of egg rolls.
.
.

143
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,030
<font color="#ffff00">No,he is gonna freak out when he finds out that he's
gonna lose all the money that he paid in deposits.
.
.

144
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,350
<font color="#ffff00">Then we'll get the deposits back.
.
.

145
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,540
<font color="#ffff00">Oh,honey,you're being so great.
.
.

146
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,540
<font color="#ffff00">How much of this is about
wanting to see me do the worm?
.
.

147
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:55,910
<font color="#ffff00">Not much. Like,70%.
.
.

148
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,090
<font color="#ffff00">Okay,dad. Try again.
.
.

149
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,150
<font color="#ffff00">All right.

.

150
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:09,850
<font color="#ffff00">Mia,seeing you on your wedding day,starting your
new life,it's like your first day of kindergarten.

your daughter,your favorite.

some ways,it's like you're being replaced.

<font color="#ffff00">Let me see if I can
explain it better,dad.
.
.

00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:55,680
<font color="#ffff00">mia's weddin is an emotional day,like
the day she said her first word.
.
.

<font color="#ffff00">What was her first word?
Do you remember what it was?

- I want in.
.
.

171

for not crying at our wedding.

says he has to send a fax and leaves the room.
.
.

00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,030
<font color="#ffff00">Why fax?
.
.

176
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:53,550

get to him,to get him a little weepy.

want to wait till after the baby comes.
.

238
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,620
<font color="#ffff00">- So what happened?
- No.

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:21,240
<font color="#ffff00">I understand 100%. You're a lesbian.
.
.

241
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:25,100
<font color="#ffff00">- No,I'm-I am not a
lesbian. - Yes,you are.
.
.

242
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:33,260
<font color="#ffff00">My friend lynn's daughter "postponed" her wedding,and
she is now living with a woman who looks like tom petty.
.
.

243
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,670
<font color="#ffff00">No. No,no,no.Mom,we still want to get
married.We just don't want to do it now.
.
.

244
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,940
<font color="#ffff00">We want to wait until after the
baby comes,so I can really enjoy it.
.
.

245
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,190
<font color="#ffff00">Okay,uh,but just to clarify,you
are actually getting married,right?
.
.

246
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:52,450
<font color="#ffff00">Because not getting married is ben's and my thing.
There's only room for one valid life choice per family.
.
.

247
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:57,450
<font color="#ffff00">I I wouldn't say there's
room.More like a quiet tolerance.
.
.

248
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:05,000
<font color="#ffff00">Well,I told your dad we were
postponing the wedding.That went okay.
.
.

249
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,450
<font color="#ffff00">- Then I told him about the deposits.
- no.
.
.

250
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,790
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah.I have never seen him that mad.
.
.

251
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:15,040
<font color="#ffff00">He was like the incredible hulk,if the hulk
stayed white,had no muscle,and lost all his hair.
.
.

252
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,100
<font color="#ffff00">We have to stop him.I still want
them to make my dress for the wedding.
.
.

253
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,650
<font color="#ffff00">This is not good.
.
.

254
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,460
<font color="#ffff00">When that man gets angry about
money,we all know how that can go.
.

clown!*************

to smack that giant smile right off your face!

has a fear of your father.

<font color="#ffff00">Do you really think I'm
gonna let you keep my deposit,

266
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:04,250
<font color="#ffff00">then sell the dress to the next pregnant
and or fat broad who walks in here?

<font color="#ffff00">Sorry,ladies.No one makes double
money off of joel putney.No one!

everywhere else that has my money.

exactly what I was afraid of!

right now would make me unhappy.

281
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:45,070
<font color="#ffff00">Of course it's about the money.
That's all you ever care about!

00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:49,360

getting up in front of all those people

<font color="#ffff00">Why do you have to be in front of people
to tell me how you feel? I'm your daughter.
.
.

286
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:58,950
<font color="#ffff00">Okay,if-if you want to tell me something,you
don't need an occasion.Just say it!
.
.

287
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:01,170
<font color="#ffff00">so I'm supposed to get up at
some random brunch and say,

<font color="#ffff00">on this special day,before you have your own child,I
want to say what an honor it was to have you as my child?

has replaced the diapers,
.
.

292
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,050
<font color="#ffff00">but I still feel the need to
protect you and make you smile,
