<i>Mia & Casey's first night apart.</i>

00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,970
I miss you when you're out of town.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,540
I miss you too.

4
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:10,180
Let's stay on the phone
until we both fall asleep.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,150
Okay.

it's no fun being alone in
the apartment when you're gone.

8
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,040
honey,you're so sweet.That's the downside to
being a lawyer.There's a lot of late nights.

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,060
- But it always does make me remember how much
- all right,well,don't let me keep you.

10
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,580
I'm gonna call it an
early night,sweetie.Bye!

11
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,650
Wait,Ben...

12
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,250
I've got the place to
myself...beers,late night cable.

13
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,530
This is gonna be epic.

14
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,640
Baby,you're snoring.Turn over.

<i>Vicky & Joel's 1072nd Night Apart</i>

16
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,220
I could get used to this.

17
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,690
I haven's even left yet.

21
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,620
How you feeling?

22
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,900
Okay.This guy just loves
standing on my bladder.

23
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,570
I have to pee so often,I
can barely finish a s...

24
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,870
you know what?I have to pee again.

25
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:37,480
Honey,we were thinking,with our new
grandchild on the way,we need to redo our will.

26
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,080
We were hoping you could
recommend a good lawyer.

27
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,580
yeah.

28
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,290
I know a pretty good lawyer.

29
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:48,130
You don't need to make it
into a game.What's his name?

30
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,190
Actually,it's a woman.

31
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,020
I don't know if I'm 100%
comfortable with that.

32
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,500
stop it,Joel.We're fine
with a woman.What's her name?

33
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,360
It's me.

34
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,890
"Me"?

35
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,500
Well,that sounds Asian.

36
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,530
I'm a lawyer.I can do your will.

37
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:11,700
Don't get so emotional.You see
what I'm saying about lady lawyers?

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,460
Well,Joel,she does know what she's
doing,and we wanna do it quickly.

39
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,520
Maybe this is our best option.

40
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:20,470
Plus,we paid for her law school.We
might as well get a free will out of it.

41
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,130
- I never said I'd do it for free.
- Thank you,honey.You are a doll.

42
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,480
And we will see you tomorrow.

43
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,860
You guys are leaving already?

44
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,280
I have at least eight minutes
until I have to pee again.

45
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,560
- Bye,Maddie.Bye,kids.
- Bye.

46
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,160
What are you smiling about?

47
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,820
Mom and dad are redoing their will,and
they just begged me to be their lawyer.

48
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,580
- That's great.
- Yeah.

49
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,660
They're finally gonna get to
see me as a professional adult.

50
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,600
Why would you want them
to see you as an adult?

51
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,740
They see me as a kid,and I love it.

52
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,190
I still get presents from Santa,and dad gives
me 20 bucks every time I go to the movies.

53
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,660
Who is it?

54
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,210
It's my ex-girlfriend.

55
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,890
Don't answer it.

56
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,840
No,it's okay.It wasn't an ugly breakup
or anything.She just moved to California.

57
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,100
Do not answer it.

58
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,930
I haven't talked to her in almost
a year.It might be important.

59
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,550
It doesn't matter.No good can
come from answering that phone.

60
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,240
I'm sure it'll be fine.

61
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,650
Hello?

62
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:17,870
It's good to hear from ya.

63
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,910
No,it isn't.Don't say that.

64
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,960
sure,it's no problem.

65
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,170
Okay.Bye.

66
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,300
See? It's fine. I told you.

67
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,810
She's just moving back to the
city.She wants her couch back.

68
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,470
This couch?

69
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,950
Yeah.

70
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:37,110
The couch that Mia's been sitting on for months is the
couch that you and your ex-girlfriend used to sit on?

71
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,310
Yeah.Did you and your
ex-girlfriend ever do...

72
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,210
"Non-sitting stuff" in this couch?

73
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,500
Yeah. That is gonna
be a problem,isn't it?

74
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:54,870
Yeah.I mean,maybe you don't know this
yet,but the putney girls are crazy jealous.

75
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,450
Who's that?

76
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,080
Nicole.

77
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,140
Nicole?The girl you dated before me?

78
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,150
We're all done with Nicole.

79
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,960
There was a picture of me and
kareem Abdul-Jabbar on that phone.

80
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,920
It's gone forever.

81
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,190
Well,I don't think it's
gonna be that big a deal.

82
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,740
I just give Jessica back her couch...

83
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,700
Jessica?Her name is Jessica?

84
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:28,110
man,this just keeps
getting worse.look...

85
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,270
Girls hate girls named Jessica
'cause they are always superhot.

86
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:38,180
I mean,Jessica Simpson,Jessica
rabbit,Jessica Carmichael.

87
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,480
She was a girl I went to
High School with.Unreal.

88
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,750
I touched 'em once.

89
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:55,030
look,it's gonna be fine.I'll just tell
Mia the truth.She'll be mad for,like,a day.

90
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,560
All right,buddy.

91
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,890
You let me know how that goes.

92
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,310
How'd that go,buddy?

93
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,010
Not well.

94
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,700
So...

95
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:12,530
I got a call from...An ex-girlfriend.

96
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,420
- On that phone?
- Yeah.

97
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,420
But,uh,it wasn't that big of a...

98
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,150
If only someone had told you
not to pick up that phone.

99
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,090
wait.Someone did.

100
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,410
I need your help.

101
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,850
I have to give Jessica her couch
back,and Mia can't find out.

102
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,610
You've been in a
relationship for nine years.

103
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,060
You must've been in
situations like this before.

104
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,180
How do I fix this?

105
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:49,290
Well,it's funny you say "fix," because I am known
in the hotel world as a little bit of a fixer.

106
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:52,300
Like,remember Harvey Keitel
in "Pulp Fiction"?I'm like him.

107
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,280
The wolf.

108
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,560
No,Harvey Keitel.

109
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,770
The wolf was Harvey Keitel's
character's name in "Pulp Fiction."

110
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,480
Cards on the table,I
never saw the movie.

111
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,380
Are you sure you can help me with this?

112
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,720
You tell me.

113
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:13,050
Two new year's eves ago,a certain county
assemblyman,I can't tell you who,Mitch Friedling...

114
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,350
found himself in my hotel the same
time as his wife,mistress,and boyfriend.

115
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:24,390
And thanks to the fixer,his marriage
is still in tact and a total sham.

116
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,830
- I guess that's good?
- So...couch has to go away.

117
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,710
Question is,what do we say to Mia?

118
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,910
Just give the fixer a moment to ponder.

119
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,990
How about I buy an identical couch?

120
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:46,130
Do you think haven't already thought
of and dismissed identical couch?

121
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:50,440
I mean,there are different scuff
marks,different stains,that new couch smell.

122
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,480
Identical couch.

123
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,300
Hey,guys.

124
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,320
Why are you staring at the couch?

125
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,720
I've got it.

126
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,010
Because it has to be moved.

127
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:06,940
- Why?
- Because it has...Termites.

128
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,370
don't worry.

129
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,270
We're gonna get rid of it this afternoon
while you're at work.Problem fixed.

130
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,920
No.This afternoon?Get rid of it now.

131
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,030
there's no reason it
can't stay he until then.

132
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,670
But I don't want termites
in my house all day.

133
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,850
Yeah,that's a good reason.

134
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,930
All right,well,I guess we will
just it outside right now then.

135
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,070
How do you even know there
are termites in there?

136
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,600
I work in the hotel industry,okay?

137
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,470
I can smell termites.

138
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,210
Termites.

139
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,790
Put it down right there.

140
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,840
Why did we have to carry
this thing eight blocks?

141
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,630
Couldn't we have just left
it in front of our house?

142
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:49,580
Oh,and run the risk of
Mia running into Jessica?

143
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,700
You do not want that,believe me.

144
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,870
Maddie met one of my exes once.

145
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,100
You stay away.You hear me?

146
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,310
I don't want to see
you around here again.

147
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,850
Next time you want a
falafel,you get it uptown!

148
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,970
That was someone I dated in fifth grade.

149
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,090
Okay.I'm sorry.

150
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,740
- What's the plan?
- Well,it's simple.

151
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,700
We'll just sit here,wait a few
hours till Jessica shows up.

152
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,800
It might actually be enjoyable.

153
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,560
- What's this?
- It's a ticket.

154
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,810
No,wait.It's a love note.

155
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,540
thought of the joke too late.

156
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,090
Anyways,you can't dump a couch there.

157
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,500
We're not dumping a
couch.We're moving it.

158
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,810
Whoa,What are you doing?Are
you writing us another ticket?

159
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,730
No,I'm just writing down the joke
so I can remember it next time.

160
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:39,010
And that's why,for people in your situation,I would
recommend a living trust instead of a standard will.

161
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,640
That sounds very smart.

162
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,930
You know what this reminds me of?

163
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:46,030
The time you pretended to be a chef and
made mud pies for all your Teddy bears.

164
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,060
Yeah.That's good reminiscing,dad.

165
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,880
But try to think of me not as
you daughter but as your lawyer.

166
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,710
I can't even hear what
she's saying,she's so cute.

167
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,510
Okay,now I understand that a will is
supposed to be a list of who gets what.

168
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:03,500
But can we add  who
doesn't get what and why?

169
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:08,330
Mom,let it go.You can't cut people out of
the will just because they're democrats.

170
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,640
All right,now let's take
a look at page two...

171
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,800
Look at her little glasses!

172
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,560
She looks like the baby from
those stock market commercials.

173
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,260
Joel,we have to...

174
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,910
Oh,my God,she does.

175
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,670
All right.

176
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,200
This is gonna work great.

177
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,060
Really?

178
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:34,100
'Cause bringing the couch to your apartment
seems like pretty much the dumbest idea ever.

179
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,660
No,it's perfect.We told Jessica
to come get the couch here.

180
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,310
Maddie never comes home during the day.

181
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,960
Maddie,you know,unlike,say,the
weather,is predictable.

182
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,640
The weather is predictable.

183
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:48,530
In fact,there is an entire profession dedicated
to predicting it.There's even a channel.

184
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,950
Okay,buddy,you need to relax.

185
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:57,170
I need to relax?I just carried an
ex-girlfriend's couch 18 blocks and got 2 tickets.

186
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,570
I needed to sit down and rest.

187
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,290
I did not know that
cop was following us.

188
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,320
But we're good.

189
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,530
Trust the plan.

190
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,630
Dad doesn't take me seriously at all...

191
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,050
Why is our couch here?

192
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,490
Because Ben's never seen "Pulp Fiction."

193
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,710
What's going on?

194
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,120
Jessica's going to be
here in four minutes.

195
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,390
Why are you here?

196
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,520
It's the middle of the day.

197
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,040
You never come home in
the middle of the day.

198
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,350
I had to get some papers
for mom and dad's will.

199
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,630
Why is our couch here?

200
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,700
In nine years,you've never come
home in the middle of the day.

201
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,100
That couch is infested with
termites.Even I can smell them,okay?

202
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,130
It shouldn't be here.

203
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,370
Termites?There are smelly
termites in my house?

204
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,860
Why are you here?I don't
understand.You shouldn't be here.

205
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,440
That couch shouldn't be here.Why
didn't you throw it away?

206
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,390
I know Ben had a reason.

207
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,340
I don't remember what it
is.I-I know,uh,Ben had one.

208
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,820
Ben?

209
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,080
How about this?

210
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,960
We're giving it to
charity.Yeah!Yeah,they fumigate it

211
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,610
and they give it  to a poor family
that's never had a couch before.right?

212
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,430
So,you know,you guys don't need to stay.

213
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,900
We got this covered.

214
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,700
Actually,Ben,I'd love to get your
take on something going on with my dad.

215
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,240
I don't have a take.

216
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,680
Well,let me tell you what's going on.

217
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,020
It's okay.I love you.

218
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,600
What?No,I really need
your advice about my dad.

219
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,070
He's making me feel like a child.

220
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,890
this sounds like a phone call.Why
don't you go to your office and call me.

221
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,420
my office.He'd have to take me
seriously if he saw me at my office.

222
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,850
You're welcome!All
right,it is time to leave.

223
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,150
But don't leave now.That's just...

224
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,090
Okay.All right.

225
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,710
I can fix this.I can fix this.

226
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:52,510
- Ben?Ben!
- I'm out,man. I'm out.

227
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,410
We gotta tell 'em the
truth.It's the only option.

228
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,090
We can't tell them the
truth now.We're in too deep.

229
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,810
We could've before,but
now it's too late.

230
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,640
I need to lie down.

231
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,810
Is someone gonna answer the door?

232
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:12,160
look! It's Ben's phone that his ex-girlfriend
Nicole called him on earlier today.

233
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,080
- What?
- What?

234
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,460
Oh,no.Not again!No!

235
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,300
There was a picture of me
and Macy gray on that phone.

236
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:21,230
Did you just lock them out?

237
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,580
- Yes.
- Genius!

238
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,170
We need to keep them out there long enough
for Jessica to take the couch and leave.

239
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,400
Jessica.

240
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,930
Why did you locks on the balcony?

241
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,200
How did you get back in?

242
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,290
I had my keys.

243
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:41,210
Who comes home and doesn't put them on
the counter?You're like a prison guard.

244
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,770
Who is this?

245
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,820
It is the charity lady,come
to pick up the couch.

246
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:46,500
What?

247
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,710
I also have a bag of old shoes for you.

248
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,660
Case,who are these people?

249
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,830
"Case"?

250
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,140
Do you guys know each other?

251
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,140
Mia,this is my...

252
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,390
Ex-girlfriend Jessica.

253
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,830
Your ex-girlfriend.

254
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:10,240
- And her couch.
- And her couch.

255
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,610
Your ex-girlfriend's
couch was in our house?

256
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:17,080
So,uh,so when,um,ahem,when we...

257
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,220
Oh,my God.

258
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,600
And after that concert
when we...oh,my God!

259
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,400
And her name is Jessica? Oh,my God!

260
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,870
Jessica,this is my fiance Mia.

261
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,620
so you wouldn't marry
me,but you'll marry this?

262
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,940
"This"?

263
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,550
- My ankle!
- stop your whining.

264
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,210
No one feels sorry for a Jessica.

265
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:48,440
I'm sorry I called you "this." I would've
never said that before moving to L.A.

266
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:51,370
California changes you,you know?

267
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,050
Well,I'm sorry I hit you with the couch.

268
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,600
What I really wanted to do what hit him.

269
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,210
You are in so much trouble.

270
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,510
You,sir,are no fixer.

271
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,190
Okay,we have to make this office
seem as professional as possible.

272
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,080
I need my parents to
think of me as an adult.

273
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,470
I understand.I think of you as an adult,

274
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,590
but not in an adult way
that's inappropriate.

275
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,230
And not that much.Just
sometimes...often.

276
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,020
I'd say often.

277
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,870
Do you...Ever think about me?

278
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:25,270
we have to get this
basketball hoop out of here.

279
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,120
what about your collection
of porcelain ponies?

280
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:32,030
I guess,in some circumstances,that
could be considered childish.

281
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:35,220
Put them away,along with the
mini-brushes I use to comb their tails.

282
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,100
Of course.

283
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,680
what about your spelling bee trophies?

284
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:41,100
No!I won those as an adult.

285
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,960
and once they get here,I want
you to bring out some tea.

286
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,430
What would you say is
the most grown-up tea?

287
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,170
English breakfast.

288
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,920
Breakfast?What,am I just waking
up?This is a business meeting.

289
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,030
I'm sorry.Earl grey?

290
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,150
Earl grey!Yes!perfect,Glen.I love you.

291
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,260
We have to put down these
pictures of me as a kid.

292
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,800
Mrs.putney.Please,have a seat.

293
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,930
Where's dad?

294
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,340
He's not coming,honey.

295
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,620
Why not?No,he has to be here.

296
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,460
We were gonna go over all
the medical stuff today.

297
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,420
Well,the truth is,um...

298
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,990
We have decided not to
update the will right now.

299
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,740
This is dad,isn't it?

300
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,120
He doesn't trust me to do the will
'cause he still sees me as a little kid.

301
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,610
- That's why he's not here.
- No,it was a mutual...

302
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,330
I can't believe him.

303
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,960
I've been doing this for a long
time,and I'm very good at it.

304
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:21,960
Why is he so pigheaded?

305
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,400
He was just trying to protect you.

306
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,340
Protect me?Protect me from what?

307
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:29,690
What did you do with those
lovely porcelain ponies?

308
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,330
Mom!

309
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:35,650
Who's ready for some Earl grey served from
a tea set I made for you at color me mine?

310
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,750
Glen,not now.

311
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,880
It's fine,Glen.She said,"not
now." She didn't say,"not ever."

312
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,040
What's going on?

313
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,370
Okay.

314
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,240
Two weeks ago,your father went
into the hospital with chest pains.

315
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,380
- What?
- It turned out to be nothing.He's fine.

316
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,500
It's just an irregular heartbeat.

317
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,610
It's something that's
very common in men his age.

318
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:57,500
Oh,my God.

319
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,430
And you know your father.

320
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,860
He's...he's very uncomfortable
talking about this kind of thing.

321
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,020
He doesn't want to worry his girls.

322
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,420
So that's why he was acting that way.

323
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,250
He was too scared to
talk to me about it.

324
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,500
What is that?

325
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,380
It's Glen crying.

326
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,610
He does it all the
time.I have no idea why.

327
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,580
And then to top everything
else off,her name is Jessica.

328
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,510
All girls hate girls named Jessica...

329
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,440
even girls named
Jessica...they hate themselves.

330
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,940
It's not my fault.

331
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,620
She moved to L.A.to be a famous actress.

332
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,260
How was I supposed to know
that wasn't gonna work out?

333
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,700
I'm sorry.I should've just told
you from the very beginning.

334
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,360
No,you shouldn't have.

335
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,040
Okay,I was doing a pretty
good job pretending that

336
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,170
I was the only girl you've ever
been with,and now you've ruined it.

337
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,440
Wait,so I shouldn't
have told you the truth?

338
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:52,670
No.You should've just done
a better job hiding it,okay?

339
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,670
I was living in a world where there
was no such thing as ex-girlfriends,

340
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:58,860
and now I can never get back to
that world because of Jessica.

341
00:16:58,970 --> 00:16:59,950
You know what?

342
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,780
I'm glad her couch has termites.

343
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:06,320
Well,to tell you the truth,Jessica
was never really my girlfriend.

344
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:09,170
She was just this crazy
woman who glommed onto me.

345
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,700
Really?So you two never dated?

346
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,550
No.

347
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,750
Really?Is that true?

348
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,860
No.I was just saying that...

349
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,230
no!You had it.

350
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,550
Look,you and I have both
been with other people.

351
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,600
That's a fact that's not gonna change.

352
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,300
But who cares?

353
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:30,080
The important thing is that neither of us is
ever going to be with anyone else ever again.

354
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:30,850
All right.I guess I can accept
that you've had other girlfriends,

355
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:36,060
but that doesn't mean I wanna live
in a house full of their stuff.

356
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:39,450
Is there anything else in here that
is connected to one of your exes?

357
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,680
How far are we going back?

358
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,850
Because my second grade
girlfriend gave me that.

359
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:48,110
the frame wi the macaroni glued to it?

360
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,130
thank God.I thought you
made that,like,a year ago.

361
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,960
Okay,look,I have an idea.

362
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:58,260
Why don't we,uh,why don't we get rid of
everything that's connected to our exes in any way?

363
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,680
Great.Let's do it right now.

364
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,110
Maybe it's okay to have a
few things from our exes.

365
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,310
Yeah,'cause it'd be great to,you know...

366
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,310
- Sit.
- Yeah.

367
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,410
I don't know why we're here.

368
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,940
I told you I don't
want to talk about it.

369
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,590
Well,you're gonna talk about it.

370
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:22,540
Serious lawyer maddie.Here
come the ha-glasses.

371
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,510
Don't joke.It is serious.

372
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,740
It was just a little
heart thing and it's fine.

373
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,480
Your mother never
should've said anything.

374
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:29,820
No reason to worry you kids.

375
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,870
Dad,that's the thing.There
are no kids,only adults...

376
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,400
adults who care about you and wanna help,but
we can't unless you tell us what's going on.

377
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,510
Okay,fine.I'll tell you every
time I have an ache or a pain.

378
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,610
right now my feet hurt,and
my nose is doing that

379
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,880
"one nostril's clogged then an hour
later it's the other one" thing.

380
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,610
Look,I know this stuff is scary and
you're uncomfortable talking about it.

381
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,400
I am,too.But I wanna help.

382
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,340
You took care of Mia and me for so long.

383
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,440
Just give us a chance to pay you back.

384
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,330
- We should order.
- Dad,please.

385
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,630
Okay. Okay,I get it.

386
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:05,280
I won't keep things like
that from you anymore.

387
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,810
Thank you.

388
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,100
It's only 'cause I love you,you know.

389
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,080
I love you,too.

390
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,390
You ready to order?

391
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:17,840
orange juice and a
vegetable scramble,please.

392
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:21,640
I would like two scrambled
eggs,potatoes,and bacon.

393
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:24,460
Fruit.Eggs,potatoes,and fruit.

394
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,070
Oh,God.Is this what
you're gonna be like now?

395
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:31,100
- It sure is.
- Thanks,honey.

396
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,840
Where do you come down on butter?

397
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,170
- A little's okay.
- Great!

398
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:37,720
Can you put a little butter on my fruit?

399
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,800
Otherwise,it tastes like nothing.

400
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,490
Sorry.

401
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,780
No,it's okay.I saw her.She's hot.

402
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:57,320
But I thought you were crazy
melt-my-phone-in-the-microwave jealous.

403
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,140
Only about people that you've been with.

404
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,450
I don't care if you check out a
stranger who happens to walk by.

405
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,960
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

406
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,210
I mean,you can't help but having eyes.

407
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,980
Plus it's way better than
hiding it like maddie and Ben do.

408
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:13,530
When they find someone attractive,they
try to cover it by saying things like...

409
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,860
Is her skirt made of gingham?

410
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,450
I always wondered what that was.

411
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:20,180
That's...that's why I
was looking at it.It's...

412
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:27,920
I just hate...Rugged guys like that.

413
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,140
He probably thinks every girl...

414
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,980
Is looking at me.

415
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:35,220
She's looking at me,and she wants me.

416
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,910
Hello,pretty.

417
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:41,150
Sadly,I can only be eye
candy because I'm taken.

418
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,570
Put your glasses on,Joel.

419
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:48,980
It's a mannequin in a
store window,and it's a boy.
