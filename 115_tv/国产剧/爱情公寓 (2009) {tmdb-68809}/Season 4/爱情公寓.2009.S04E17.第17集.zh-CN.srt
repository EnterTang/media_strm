1
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:36,828
She screamed as the pain
ripped through her,

2
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,831
and in between each labored
breath, she thought,

3
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:42,334
there is no way in hell
I am having this baby

4
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:44,336
on a subway train in the Bronx.

5
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:46,755
Did you get all that?

6
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,174
So you actually gave birth
to your son on the Metro?

7
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:49,925
No.

8
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,009
She didn't.

9
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,762
She also didn't run a marathon
the week before she had me

10
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:56,098
or beat up a mugger while
nine months pregnant.

11
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:57,850
It's called dramatic
license, darling.

12
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:58,767
Actually, it's called
wild exaggeration.

13
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,561
Dramatic license
applies to writing.

14
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,645
And that's what I'm doing.

15
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:02,688
This is Marcus,

16
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:05,357
this fabulous young
playwright I told you about,

17
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:07,526
who's helping me put
together my one-woman show.

18
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:08,610
Mr. Castle, I'm a huge fan.

19
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,904
Just being in this office
is a dream come true.

20
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,239
For me, too. For me, too.

21
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:13,615
Only in my dreams, I'm...

22
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:14,616
usually by myself.

23
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:18,370
We just felt that this room
had the best creative juju.

24
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,663
Oh, it does. It does.

25
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,373
Yeah, I wrote 20 best
sellers in here.

26
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:22,875
Right, right.

27
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,042
I'd like to write another one.

28
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,087
Now.

29
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,131
Oh, can't it wait, dear?

30
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:31,466
We're just putting the
final touches on act one--

31
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,344
you know, where I overcome
the challenges of being

32
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:36,430
a single, working mother.

33
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,349
You know you're
writing a work of fiction, right?

34
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:41,727
Castle.

35
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,772
First Alexis is interning for Lanie.
Thank you.

36
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:47,774
Now my mother is
taking over my office.

37
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,651
I feel like my whole
life is being invaded.

38
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,528
You'll get used to it. I did.

39
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:57,159
Okay, it's similar, just
much less invasive.

40
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:58,285
Hey, Lanie.

41
00:01:58,744 --> 00:01:59,578
So what do we got here?

44
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,333
based on body temp and lividity,

45
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,210
our victim died between
10:00 and midnight.

46
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:07,544
Claw marks?

47
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,087
She was attacked by an animal?

48
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,840
Well, she was running
from something.

49
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:13,091
She's got dirt on her feet.

50
00:02:13,056 --> 00:02:15,976
What animal in central park
could maul a person to death?

51
00:02:15,968 --> 00:02:17,970
I'm not even sure
that's what happened.

52
00:02:18,262 --> 00:02:21,306
These lacerations look
shallow, nonlethal,

53
00:02:21,306 --> 00:02:22,933
but I won't know exactly
what killed her

54
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:24,101
until I get her
back to the morgue.

55
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:24,935
Do you have an ID?

56
00:02:25,144 --> 00:02:27,438
No wallet or purse, so we
don't know who she is.

57
00:02:31,608 --> 00:02:33,819
Isn't it obvious?
I mean, am I the only one seeing this?

58
00:02:34,027 --> 00:02:34,611
What?

59
00:02:35,195 --> 00:02:37,406
Red cloak, in the
woods, animal attack.

60
00:02:38,824 --> 00:02:40,367
She's little Red Riding Hood.

61
00:02:41,118 --> 00:02:43,954
Great, Castle. I'll call in an APB
for the Big Bad Wolf.

62
00:02:44,204 --> 00:02:45,122
You have a better theory?

63
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:48,500
Hey, Ryan.

64
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:50,961
Do you think you
could call dispatch,

65
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:52,880
see if there any reports
of a violent animal

66
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,714
running around the park?

67
00:02:53,714 --> 00:02:55,090
Like a wolf, a big bad one?

68
00:02:55,841 --> 00:02:56,467
Really?

69
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:59,720
That is exactly how
I pictured her.

70
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,512
It's freaky.

71
00:03:00,846 --> 00:03:02,514
My older sister used
to read me that story.

72
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:05,059
Okay, when you're done reliving
your childhood memories,

73
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,643
do you also think that you
could canvass the area

74
00:03:06,643 --> 00:03:08,604
for witnesses and anyone
that might know her name?

75
00:03:08,937 --> 00:03:11,482
And I bet you it's not gonna
be little Red Riding Hood.

76
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:12,191
On it.

77
00:03:13,573 --> 00:03:14,782
"'All the better
to eat you with.

78
00:03:15,033 --> 00:03:16,951
"No sooner had the
wolf said these words

79
00:03:17,243 --> 00:03:18,703
"when he leaped up
and gobbled down

80
00:03:18,703 --> 00:03:20,063
poor little Red Riding Hood."

81
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:21,820
Well, the good news is,
the wolf can talk.

82
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,989
So if we can find him, we might
be able to get a confession.

83
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:25,240
Yeah, except in the
original story,

84
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,993
the wolf doesn't kill
little Red Riding Hood.

85
00:03:27,993 --> 00:03:30,203
The huntsman cuts her out
of the wolf's stomach,

86
00:03:30,203 --> 00:03:31,413
and then she kills the wolf.

87
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,956
Someone's a Brothers Grimm fan.

88
00:03:33,206 --> 00:03:34,833
Oh, yeah.
They didn't sugarcoat it.

89
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,084
They understood that fairy tales

90
00:03:36,084 --> 00:03:37,419
are pretty much horror stories.

91
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:39,879
Exactly, which is why
we all need them

92
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,089
to grapple with the unknown,

93
00:03:41,089 --> 00:03:42,966
which is why they tap
into our primal fears,

94
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:45,969
like being alone in the woods
or getting eaten by monsters.

95
00:03:45,969 --> 00:03:48,179
They're not horror stories.
They're life lessons.

96
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:50,223
If you do the rit thing, you get
to live happily ever after.

97
00:03:50,223 --> 00:03:51,433
But only in fairy tales.

98
00:03:51,433 --> 00:03:53,268
Speaking of fairy tales,
turns out that our victim

99
00:03:53,268 --> 00:03:54,603
really was Red Riding Hood.

100
00:03:54,728 --> 00:03:56,479
Are you drinking
Castle's kool-aid now?

101
00:03:56,688 --> 00:03:58,273
No, I mean that she was
actually wearing Red Riding Hood costume

102
00:03:58,764 --> 00:03:59,765
it said so right on the label.

103
00:03:59,848 --> 00:04:01,225
Oh, okay.
So then why was she wearing it

104
00:04:01,225 --> 00:04:02,518
in the middle of the
woods at night?

105
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:03,936
On her way to
grandmother's house?

106
00:04:04,103 --> 00:04:05,270
Mm. I doubt it.

107
00:04:05,604 --> 00:04:06,855
Her grandmother lives
in Tallahassee.

108
00:04:07,106 --> 00:04:08,273
Oh, great. So you got an ID ?

109
00:04:08,273 --> 00:04:10,109
Yeah. Her prints popped
in the DMV database.

110
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,193
Her name's Amy Morgan.

111
00:04:11,235 --> 00:04:12,611
Her sister Leslie's
on her way in.

112
00:04:13,445 --> 00:04:14,321
I don't understand.

113
00:04:14,405 --> 00:04:16,949
Are you saying Amy was attacked
by some kind of animal?

114
00:04:17,032 --> 00:04:19,410
Do either of you have any
idea why she was in the park?

115
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,412
Amy never went there.
She didn't have time.

116
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:23,264
She was too busy.
- Doing what?

117
00:04:23,255 --> 00:04:26,550
Sh-she was an attorney
for Sampson-Briggs litigation.

118
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,719
They worked her, like, a
hundred hours a week.

119
00:04:28,803 --> 00:04:29,804
Did she have a boyfriend,

120
00:04:29,804 --> 00:04:31,514
anyone that she would've
been with last night?

121
00:04:31,764 --> 00:04:32,640
Amy's single.

122
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:34,433
She lives alone.

123
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:37,311
Um... she's very driven.

124
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,563
Was.

125
00:04:40,106 --> 00:04:41,065
She was.

126
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:44,443
Do either of you know why
she would be wearing this?

127
00:04:48,343 --> 00:04:49,302
What is it, a cape?

128
00:04:49,927 --> 00:04:51,262
It's a Red Riding Hood cloak.

129
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,097
She was wearing that?

130
00:04:55,058 --> 00:04:57,769
I know Amy's closet.
This was not hers.

131
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:00,063
I mean, even her
sweatpants were Prada.

132
00:05:00,063 --> 00:05:01,564
Well, maybe she was
going to a party.

133
00:05:01,564 --> 00:05:02,899
Did she mention any parties?

134
00:05:03,107 --> 00:05:05,201
I'm telling you, she would
never wear a thing like this.

135
00:05:05,253 --> 00:05:07,255
Leslie, did your
sister ever tell you

136
00:05:07,255 --> 00:05:11,175
about anything unusual going on
at work or in her personal life?

137
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,009
I don't know.

138
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,595
I hadn't heard
from her all week.

139
00:05:15,054 --> 00:05:16,347
And was that out
of the ordinary?

140
00:05:16,722 --> 00:05:18,933
Yes.
We usually talked every day,

141
00:05:18,933 --> 00:05:21,185
and when she didn't
call, I just assumed

142
00:05:21,185 --> 00:05:23,062
she was busy with a case
or something, but...

143
00:05:23,213 --> 00:05:24,840
maybe there was something
else going on.

144
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:27,593
Okay, bye.

145
00:05:28,552 --> 00:05:30,804
Hey. Thank you.
So that was Ryan.

146
00:05:31,847 --> 00:05:33,724
He just left animal
control, and there was

147
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:36,393
only one recent report of an
animal loose in the park--

148
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:38,771
a Beagle named Fred.

149
00:05:39,563 --> 00:05:41,607
Well, either Fred is
one vicious Beagle

150
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,317
or this mystery has
just deepened.

151
00:05:43,901 --> 00:05:45,736
How does a high-powered lawyer

152
00:05:46,445 --> 00:05:48,697
end up dead in a Red
Riding Hood costume?

153
00:05:52,076 --> 00:05:54,912
Amy worked long hours under
high pressure, right?

154
00:05:55,537 --> 00:05:57,498
What if she had a secret
way of letting off steam

155
00:05:57,498 --> 00:05:58,916
that even her sister
didn't know about?

156
00:05:59,177 --> 00:05:59,844
Like what?

157
00:06:00,178 --> 00:06:03,723
There's this whole adult
role-playing subculture

158
00:06:03,848 --> 00:06:05,767
obsessed with fairy tales.

159
00:06:06,851 --> 00:06:09,354
No, not that kind
of adult role play,

160
00:06:09,354 --> 00:06:11,105
although, there
is that one, too.

161
00:06:11,231 --> 00:06:12,440
And you know this how?

162
00:06:13,066 --> 00:06:14,067
Did a little research.

163
00:06:15,902 --> 00:06:16,778
Bo peep.

164
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:18,363
Anyway, these people

165
00:06:18,363 --> 00:06:20,490
get dressed in the outfits,
they play the characters,

166
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,242
they even reenact the stories.

167
00:06:22,283 --> 00:06:23,701
Maybe that's what Amy was doing

168
00:06:23,701 --> 00:06:26,162
when everything went horribly
and tragically wrong.

169
00:06:26,746 --> 00:06:30,041
Castle, that is a surprisingly 
reasonable and grounded theory.

170
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:30,875
Yeah.

171
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:33,628
Frankly, I'm a little
disappointed in myself.

172
00:06:34,212 --> 00:06:35,129
We all are, bro.

173
00:06:35,713 --> 00:06:37,632
So I was going over
Amy'financials

174
00:06:37,632 --> 00:06:39,050
for any unusual activity.

175
00:06:39,217 --> 00:06:44,722
4 days ago, she took out $50,605
from her savings, all in cash.

176
00:06:45,181 --> 00:06:48,203
$50,605? That's an odd amount for a
withdrawal, especially in cash.

177
00:06:48,322 --> 00:06:49,198
Yeah, not only that,

178
00:06:49,406 --> 00:06:51,241
but the 50k, it's not
in her apartment,

179
00:06:51,283 --> 00:06:52,826
and I can't tie it to
any recent purchases.

180
00:06:52,951 --> 00:06:53,786
Contact her bank.

181
00:06:53,786 --> 00:06:55,329
See if they know why she
made that withdrawal.

182
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:55,996
As you wish.

183
00:06:57,207 --> 00:06:58,417
Oh, Lanie's got news for us.

184
00:06:58,625 --> 00:06:59,960
Oh, I've got news, all right,

185
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,295
but I'm not sure
you're gonna like it.

186
00:07:01,545 --> 00:07:05,090
I found hairs like this one
in a wound on the victim's arm.

187
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,967
It didn't come from
her, so I ran DNA.

188
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:08,135
Did we get a match?

189
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,429
The hair isn't human.
It's wolf hair.

190
00:07:10,637 --> 00:07:11,305
Ooh.

191
00:07:11,471 --> 00:07:13,557
Simmer down, Castle.
I'm not done with the story.

192
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,767
Sorry. What's the rest of it?

193
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:18,103
Well, from the depth and
the length of the gashes,

194
00:07:18,103 --> 00:07:20,231
it looks like the marks
were made by only one claw.

195
00:07:20,962 --> 00:07:21,963
A one-legged wolf?

196
00:07:22,422 --> 00:07:23,673
I don't think it's
a wolf at all.

197
00:07:24,048 --> 00:07:25,133
But the hair and the claw?

198
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:27,177
The killer wanted us
to think it was a wolf

199
00:07:27,177 --> 00:07:27,969
to throw us off.

200
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:30,513
Which would explain why there are 
no bite marks on the body.

201
00:07:30,514 --> 00:07:34,024
The gashes were afflicted by a human
killer using a wolf claw.

202
00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:35,424
So then what's the
real cause of death?

203
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,987
Well, I found two
fresh needle marks,

204
00:07:37,987 --> 00:07:39,113
both on the victim's back,

205
00:07:39,113 --> 00:07:41,031
so she didn't put them there herself.

206
00:07:41,156 --> 00:07:42,157
So she was drugged?

207
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,786
No, but tox results

208
00:07:45,786 --> 00:07:47,621
turned up ketamine
and oxycodone.

209
00:07:47,663 --> 00:07:50,124
I'm thinking our guy sedated
her with the ketamine

210
00:07:50,124 --> 00:07:51,542
then dressed her in the costume,

211
00:07:51,792 --> 00:07:53,377
but the dose didn't
quite knock her out.

212
00:07:53,377 --> 00:07:54,920
So she tried to run
away from her killer...

213
00:07:55,004 --> 00:07:56,046
And when he caught her,

214
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,924
he dosed her with oxy,
and it was lights out.

215
00:08:00,342 --> 00:08:02,136
The drugs, the claw--

216
00:08:02,261 --> 00:08:04,972
this is murder, planned
and premeditated.

217
00:08:04,972 --> 00:08:07,308
I mean, the killer
staged the crime scene

218
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:09,518
to evoke images of
little Red Riding Hood.

219
00:08:09,518 --> 00:08:10,644
Yeah, but why would he do that?

220
00:08:10,811 --> 00:08:12,271
Well, I'm less
concerned about why.

221
00:08:12,271 --> 00:08:14,315
What I'm wondering is who.

222
00:08:14,982 --> 00:08:17,109
So the killer must have
lured Amy into the park.

223
00:08:17,985 --> 00:08:19,778
Which means he's someone
that she knew and trusted.

224
00:08:19,862 --> 00:08:21,822
Yeah, like Red Riding Hood
trusted her cute little granny.

225
00:08:21,822 --> 00:08:24,241
Yeah. Ryan, what did Amy's
coworkers tell you?

226
00:08:24,241 --> 00:08:26,160
Uh, that, uh, she definitely

227
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,119
wasn't herself lately.

228
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:29,496
Said she'd been acting
agitated since she missed

229
00:08:29,496 --> 00:08:31,665
a mandatory 1:00 staff
meeting last Friday.

230
00:08:31,665 --> 00:08:32,917
Said it was for
personal reasons.

231
00:08:32,917 --> 00:08:35,211
That's the same time that Amy
stopped calling her sister.

232
00:08:35,252 --> 00:08:37,004
Ryan, can you look into her
e-mails and phone calls?

233
00:08:37,004 --> 00:08:38,297
I want to know what was
going on with her.

234
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:38,964
Yep.

235
00:08:39,715 --> 00:08:40,341
Yo, Beckett.

236
00:08:40,841 --> 00:08:41,842
There's something
you need to see.

237
00:08:45,638 --> 00:08:46,388
Right over there.

238
00:08:50,351 --> 00:08:51,685
Is that what I think
it is in her hand?

239
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,479
A poisoned apple.

240
00:09:02,196 --> 00:09:03,030
She's Snow White.

241
00:09:03,447 --> 00:09:04,281
It looks like we've got

242
00:09:04,281 --> 00:09:05,866
a fairy-tale killer
on our hands.

243

Yo, Beckett.

245
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,377
Excuse me.

246
00:09:20,045 --> 00:09:21,588
Her medicalert bracelet
got us an ID.

247
00:09:21,922 --> 00:09:23,423
She's Kristina Curtis, 25.

248
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,758
Lives on the Upper East Side.

249
00:09:24,758 --> 00:09:25,592
Does she have next of kin?

250
00:09:25,592 --> 00:09:27,594
Yeah, her husband.
His name's Noah Curtis.

251
00:09:27,594 --> 00:09:29,512
Okay, I need you guys to
take point on the interview.

252
00:09:29,512 --> 00:09:30,805
Find out what he
knows about this,

253
00:09:30,805 --> 00:09:33,141
and let's see if Kristina was
connected to the other victim.

254
00:09:33,141 --> 00:09:34,601
You know, if our killer's
dressing his victims

255
00:09:34,601 --> 00:09:35,393
in these costumes,

256
00:09:36,102 --> 00:09:37,729
I bet we can ID
the manufacturer

257
00:09:37,729 --> 00:09:38,855
and find out where he got 'em.

258
00:09:38,939 --> 00:09:40,065
That's a good idea.
You run with it.

259
00:09:41,691 --> 00:09:43,360
Huh, here it is. "White as snow,

260
00:09:43,443 --> 00:09:45,111
red as blood, black as ebony."

261
00:09:45,111 --> 00:09:48,406
This guy is quoting directly from
Grimm's original "Snow White."

262
00:09:48,406 --> 00:09:50,951
So our victims aren't
reenacting the fairy tales,

263
00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:52,327
the killer is.

264
00:09:52,869 --> 00:09:54,955
Only this woman didn't die
from a poisoned apple.

265
00:09:54,955 --> 00:09:57,582
She has the same injection
marks as Amy Morgan.

266
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:58,959
Do you have time of death?

267
00:09:59,251 --> 00:10:01,002
Between 5:00 and 7:00 am this morning.

268
00:10:01,127 --> 00:10:02,629
So he kills Red Riding Hood,

269
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:05,006
then six hours later,
he strikes again?

270
00:10:05,006 --> 00:10:06,091
That's a pretty
quick turnaround.

271
00:10:06,091 --> 00:10:07,676
It's all the markings
of a serial killer.

272
00:10:07,884 --> 00:10:08,760
Yeah, but technically,

273
00:10:08,969 --> 00:10:10,887
you have to murder three
times to be a serial killer.

274
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:12,472
Yeah, well, let's make
sure he never gets there.

275
00:10:14,307 --> 00:10:16,059
When did you last see
your wife, Mr. Curtis?

276
00:10:16,601 --> 00:10:18,103
Just before 5:00 am, when she--

277
00:10:18,395 --> 00:10:19,563
she left for her jog.

278
00:10:19,604 --> 00:10:21,022
She--she gave me
a kiss good-bye.

279
00:10:21,565 --> 00:10:22,649
That was the last
time I saw her.

280
00:10:23,817 --> 00:10:25,944
I-I-I can't-- I can't
believe she's gone.

281
00:10:27,112 --> 00:10:28,905
Mr. Curtis, this run she took,

282
00:10:28,905 --> 00:10:29,948
who else knew she was going?

283
00:10:30,282 --> 00:10:31,741
Other joggers in
the park, I guess.

284
00:10:32,492 --> 00:10:35,078
She--she went every morning,
even in the snow.

285
00:10:35,287 --> 00:10:36,454
She--she never missed a day.

286
00:10:37,163 --> 00:10:38,832
She have problems with any
of the other joggers?

287
00:10:38,957 --> 00:10:40,375
No, not that she told me.

288
00:10:41,001 --> 00:10:42,919
Did she ever mention being
followed or watched?

289
00:10:43,253 --> 00:10:44,963
Are you saying someone
was stalking her?

290
00:10:45,422 --> 00:10:46,673
Under the circumstances,

291
00:10:46,673 --> 00:10:48,675
this doesn't look
like a random attack.

292
00:10:48,675 --> 00:10:49,885
What did your wife
do for a living?

293
00:10:51,344 --> 00:10:53,138
She owned an art gallery
on Fifth Avenue.

294
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:55,139
Her family owned it, she took it
over from her dad.

295
00:10:56,141 --> 00:10:57,100
Did you ever see
this woman before

296
00:10:58,518 --> 00:10:59,769
or heard the name Amy Morgan?

297
00:11:00,103 --> 00:11:01,605
No, I don't think so.
Why? Who is she?

298
00:11:02,188 --> 00:11:03,481
She's another victim,
Mr. Curtis.

299
00:11:04,524 --> 00:11:06,192
Could she be an
acquaintance of Kristina's?

300
00:11:10,947 --> 00:11:12,741
I don't recognize her.
I'm sorry.

301
00:11:13,366 --> 00:11:16,161
Did you notice anything unusual
about Kristina lately,

302
00:11:16,161 --> 00:11:18,538
her--her state of mind, maybe
something she said or did?

303
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,625
There was something
strange last week.

304
00:11:23,084 --> 00:11:24,711
We were supposed to
have lunch on Friday.

305
00:11:24,711 --> 00:11:25,879
But she didn't show.

306
00:11:26,004 --> 00:11:28,715
She called later to say she
went to the art gallery

307
00:11:28,715 --> 00:11:30,008
for a last-minute emergency.

308
00:11:30,383 --> 00:11:32,219
Last Friday?
Was your lunch at 1:00 pm?

309
00:11:33,386 --> 00:11:34,387
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

310
00:11:35,555 --> 00:11:36,264
W-why?

311
00:11:39,935 --> 00:11:41,019
Kristina lied to her husband

312
00:11:41,228 --> 00:11:42,896
about why she
missed their lunch.

313
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,898
She wasn't at the art
gallery last Friday.

314
00:11:44,898 --> 00:11:45,899
They don't know where she was.

315
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:48,485
Okay, so both of our victims
were unaccounted for

316
00:11:48,485 --> 00:11:51,738
at exactly the same time shortly
before they got killed.

317
00:11:51,947 --> 00:11:52,906
So where did they go?

318
00:11:53,156 --> 00:11:54,574
Yeah, still working on it.
Excuse me.

319
00:11:54,574 --> 00:11:55,408
Yeah, Ryan here.

320
00:11:55,909 --> 00:11:56,993
Maybe they knew each other.

321
00:11:57,077 --> 00:11:58,828
No, their family said they
didn't know each other.

322
00:11:58,828 --> 00:12:00,580
They had completely
different careers,

323
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,998
and they lived in
different parts of town.

324
00:12:02,624 --> 00:12:05,001
It seems like their lives
never really intersected.

325
00:12:05,252 --> 00:12:07,295
Mm, until they both died at
the hand of the same killer.

326
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:10,549
So why these two women
and why fairy tales?

327
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:12,759
Did the killer have some
kind of a random obsession

328
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:15,679
or was there a deeper
meaning behind all of it?

329
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:17,430
Well, I think he's trying to
tell a story with these bodies.

330
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,682
I just don't know
what it is yet.

331
00:12:18,932 --> 00:12:19,766
Maybe it's about money.

332
00:12:20,016 --> 00:12:22,060
Turns out Kristina raided
her trust account.

333
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,103
Guess how much she took out?

334
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,189
$50,605.

335
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,109
So both victims
go AWOL on Friday

336
00:12:29,109 --> 00:12:31,069
and both pull out the exact
same amount of cash.

337
00:12:31,069 --> 00:12:31,861
That's not a coincidence.

338
00:12:31,861 --> 00:12:32,946
That is a connection.

339
00:12:32,946 --> 00:12:34,447
Can you get ahold of
Kristina's family,

340
00:12:34,447 --> 00:12:35,907
see if they know why she might
have needed that money?

341
00:12:35,907 --> 00:12:36,992
Yeah, I'll reach out
to the husband.

342
00:12:37,033 --> 00:12:38,493
Thanks.
Ryan, what did you find out?

343
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,662
I think I might have found
the pathway to our killer.

344
00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:42,706
Those Snow White and Red
Riding Hood outfits--

345
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:44,165
they were made by the
same manufacturer.

346
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,292
Do you know where
they were sold?

347
00:12:45,417 --> 00:12:47,377
I'm still waiting for
a list of stores

348
00:12:47,377 --> 00:12:49,671
that carry the costumes, both
online and brick and mortar.

349
00:12:49,671 --> 00:12:50,881
We should have some
answers by the morning.

350
00:12:53,931 --> 00:12:57,166
Move that chair over there.
Oh Richard, your timing is perfect.

351
00:12:57,283 --> 00:12:58,410
We could use your help.

352
00:12:58,451 --> 00:13:00,078
Moving my furniture where
I don't want it to go?

353
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:01,037
It's just temporary.

354
00:13:01,204 --> 00:13:03,498
We're having a staged
reading of my one-woman show,

355
00:13:03,498 --> 00:13:04,457
here, tomorrow night.

356
00:13:04,457 --> 00:13:06,501
Ah, it's too bad you don't
have an acting studio

357
00:13:06,501 --> 00:13:07,752
to do this kind of thing in.

358
00:13:07,752 --> 00:13:09,546
Oh, wait. You do.

359
00:13:09,713 --> 00:13:11,840
The little Black Box Theater
is not right for this, dear.

360
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,216
It needs something
much more intimate.

361
00:13:13,216 --> 00:13:15,927
It'll be very avant-garde.
- Exactly.

362
00:13:15,807 --> 00:13:18,393
Now I think this chair
should be here, Marcus.

363
00:13:18,393 --> 00:13:20,229
I want to create a...

364
00:13:20,229 --> 00:13:21,396
Sweetie, couldn't you
have done something

365
00:13:21,396 --> 00:13:22,314
to discourage this?

366
00:13:22,356 --> 00:13:25,025
I tried, dad, but she
made me stage mager.

367
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,777
Look, it's not as
bad as you think.

368
00:13:26,902 --> 00:13:28,570
- Just 20 or 30 people...
- Ah--

369
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:31,323
And we'll put everything back.
This play means a lot to gram,

370
00:13:31,406 --> 00:13:32,991
and it's actually really good.

371
00:13:33,909 --> 00:13:35,911
Now I understand things about
her I never did before,

372
00:13:36,317 --> 00:13:37,234
and about you, too.

373
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:40,321
About me?

374
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:41,405
No, no, no, no.

375
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:43,324
This--this space
needs to be bigger.

376
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:44,408
An actor needs space.

377
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,368
"Richard always had
a dark imagination.

378
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:48,495
"He was destined either
to become a serial killer

379
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,247
or a mystery writer."
Mother, really?

380
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,249
Oh, it's just a
slight exaggeration.

381
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:54,710
And according to this, you're
responsible for launching

382
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:55,711
my writing career by...

383
00:13:57,421 --> 00:13:58,714
You slept with my
first publisher?

384
00:13:58,756 --> 00:14:00,341
Mr. Castle, I'm sure your talent

385
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:01,675
would've gotten you
there eventually.

386
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,927
My talent did get me there.

387
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:06,096
I didn't get published
because of her.

388
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,183
Technically, I slept with him
after your book was out.

389
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:11,352
This is just to be
more salacious.

390
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:13,979
Wasn't he practically my age?

391
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,981
Honey, you know I've
always loved younger men.

392
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:18,275
They have so much energy,
enough to keep up with me...

393
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:19,777
most of the time.

394
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:20,476
I'm gonna...

395
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,436
erase that image from my mind

396
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,521
with a bottle of scotch.

397
00:14:23,938 --> 00:14:24,939
Oh, darling,

398
00:14:25,147 --> 00:14:27,316
I invited Beckett to the
reading tomorrow night,

399
00:14:27,358 --> 00:14:29,485
so you two might want
to make a date of it.

400
00:14:31,865 --> 00:14:33,534
What was I supposed to do,
say no?

401
00:14:33,534 --> 00:14:34,701
Yes.

402
00:14:34,868 --> 00:14:37,079
Why are you so against
your mom's play?

403
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:38,872
Because she's rewriting history--

404
00:14:38,872 --> 00:14:39,748
my history.

405
00:14:39,748 --> 00:14:41,959
Trust me, I lived through it.

406
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:44,836
She's making it sound like it's
her own personal fairy tale.

407
00:14:44,836 --> 00:14:46,964
Oh, so you don't like
it when someone writes

408
00:14:46,964 --> 00:14:49,049
their own version of your life?

409
00:14:49,216 --> 00:14:50,300
Interesting.

410
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,052
Okay, are you referring
to the Nikki Heat books?

411
00:14:52,052 --> 00:14:53,428
Because this is
completely different.

412
00:14:53,428 --> 00:14:54,263
How is it different?

413
00:14:54,263 --> 00:14:56,849
Well, for one thing,
I'm not claiming

414
00:14:56,849 --> 00:14:58,392
that what I write
is actually true.

415
00:14:58,392 --> 00:14:59,893
Well, I don't think
she is either.

416
00:14:59,893 --> 00:15:01,603
Come on, Castle, you
said so yourself,

417
00:15:01,603 --> 00:15:04,314
everyone needs a fairy tale.

418
00:15:04,523 --> 00:15:06,400
What's the harm in letting
your mom have one of her own?

419
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,277
Okay, let's--let's
change the subject

420
00:15:08,277 --> 00:15:09,845
to something less likely
to give me an ulcer.

421
00:15:09,941 --> 00:15:12,944
How about that
mysterious $50,605?

422
00:15:12,944 --> 00:15:13,778
Okay.

423
00:15:13,778 --> 00:15:16,531
Um, well, we talked to
pretty much everyone

424
00:15:16,531 --> 00:15:17,866
close to Amy and Kristina,

425
00:15:17,866 --> 00:15:20,577
and no one seems to know why
they pulled out that money.

426
00:15:20,577 --> 00:15:22,328
What about where they were
at 1:00 pm on Friday?

427
00:15:22,328 --> 00:15:24,289
Nothing popped on Amy's e-mail

428
00:15:24,831 --> 00:15:25,874
or phone calls,

429
00:15:25,874 --> 00:15:28,460
and the techs are still going
through Kristina's computer.

430
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,252
Hey, guys.

431
00:15:29,252 --> 00:15:30,462
I think we might
have caught a break.

432
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,630
We tracked down that web
site that sold the costumes.

433
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,424
The Red Riding Hood cloak
and the Snow White dress

434
00:15:34,424 --> 00:15:36,176
worn by our victims were
shipped out eight days ago.

435
00:15:36,176 --> 00:15:37,510
To whom? Do you have a name?

436
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,762
Yeah, Jamie Isaacson.

437
00:15:38,762 --> 00:15:40,221
Lives at 11th Street
and 7th Avenue.

438
00:15:40,221 --> 00:15:41,556
And he didn't just
order two costumes.

439
00:15:41,556 --> 00:15:43,141
There was a third in
the shipment as well,

440
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:44,267
for Sleeping Beauty.

441
00:15:44,267 --> 00:15:45,602
Sleeping Beauty?

442
00:15:46,227 --> 00:15:47,395
He's gonna kill again.

443
00:15:47,395 --> 00:15:49,064
Not if we get to him first.

444
00:15:55,335 --> 00:15:57,337
Jamie Isaacson, NYPD.

445
00:15:57,337 --> 00:15:58,505
Open up.

446
00:16:00,507 --> 00:16:01,842
- Kick it.
- Yeah.

447
00:16:02,342 --> 00:16:04,428
Go, go, go, go!

448
00:16:09,016 --> 00:16:10,017
Room clear.

449
00:16:10,183 --> 00:16:11,310
Room clear.

450
00:16:16,982 --> 00:16:18,275
All these freaky dolls--

451
00:16:18,317 --> 00:16:20,110
just how I pictured
this guy's lair.

452
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:24,531
Ever since Chucky I haven't 
been able to look at a doll.

453
00:16:25,073 --> 00:16:26,283
Detectives!

454
00:16:33,324 --> 00:16:36,243
Did you have to
knock down my door?

455
00:16:36,493 --> 00:16:37,828
Ma'am, we announced ourselves.

456
00:16:37,828 --> 00:16:39,330
I was coming.

457
00:16:39,913 --> 00:16:42,833
I don't move as
fast as I used to.

458
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,419
Ma'am, do you know
a Jamie Isaacson?

459
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:48,464
Of course I know a
Jamie Isaacson.

460
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:52,092
I'm Jamie Isaacson.

461
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:53,771
Y--

462
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,941
Candy? It's very good.

463
00:16:56,941 --> 00:16:58,108
No, thanks.

464
00:16:58,359 --> 00:17:00,444
Mrs. Isaacson, does
anyone else live here?

465
00:17:00,444 --> 00:17:03,447
No, dearie, nobody
else lives here,

466
00:17:03,447 --> 00:17:05,282
just me and my friends.

467
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:08,994
Do you have any family
who checks on you,

468
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:10,120
health care workers?

469
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,706
Other more, um, human friends?

470
00:17:13,123 --> 00:17:15,876
Well, mostly, it's just us. Why?

471
00:17:16,418 --> 00:17:19,171
Did you receive a package
in the mail last week, Mrs. Isaacson?

472
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:21,757
Oh, I receive packages
all the time.

473
00:17:21,757 --> 00:17:23,835
Molly and Abigail
are new arrivals.

474
00:17:24,202 --> 00:17:26,313
Aren't they gorgeous?
- Yes, they are.

475
00:17:26,772 --> 00:17:29,025
What about a delivery
of fairy-tale costumes?

476
00:17:29,025 --> 00:17:30,985
Fairy-tale costumes?

477
00:17:30,985 --> 00:17:32,111
According to our records,

478
00:17:32,111 --> 00:17:34,572
you ordered three from
a web site last week.

479
00:17:34,572 --> 00:17:36,198
Well, that's just ridiculous.

480
00:17:36,198 --> 00:17:38,784
What would I do with
fairy-tale costumes?

481
00:17:38,784 --> 00:17:40,036
Can't imagine.

482
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:42,204
So you didn't order any
costumes from the internet?

483
00:17:42,204 --> 00:17:44,457
Do I look like someone
who's in the habit

484
00:17:44,457 --> 00:17:45,833
of wasting money?

485
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,668
I-I'm on a fixed income.

486
00:17:47,835 --> 00:17:50,254
Well, I happened to notice
that you don't have

487
00:17:50,254 --> 00:17:53,090
a doorman for this building.
So where are your packages left?

488
00:17:53,132 --> 00:17:55,051
By the mailbox in the lobby.

489
00:17:55,051 --> 00:17:59,840
Mrs. Isaacson, did you notice any,
uh, unusual charges on your credit card?

490
00:18:00,367 --> 00:18:02,036
Anyone have access to it?

491
00:18:02,036 --> 00:18:04,789
Well, not unless they're
digging for gold.

492
00:18:05,664 --> 00:18:07,958
Can't be too safe these days.

493
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:10,211
Yeah.

494
00:18:10,252 --> 00:18:12,671
So, UPS confirms that
a package of costumes

495
00:18:12,671 --> 00:18:13,672
was dropped off

496
00:18:13,714 --> 00:18:16,425
at Mrs. Isaacson's lobby,
but nobody signed for it,

497
00:18:16,425 --> 00:18:18,010
per buyer's instructions.

498
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,345
Here's some more bad news--

499
00:18:19,345 --> 00:18:21,680
no security cameras inside
the lobby or outside.

500
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,099
And from what we could tell,

501
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:24,475
the building's not
terribly secure.

502
00:18:24,475 --> 00:18:25,518
Our killer probably knew that.

503
00:18:25,518 --> 00:18:27,019
That's why he used it
as a delivery drop.

504
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:28,687
Well, if he knew the old
lady's credit card number,

505
00:18:28,687 --> 00:18:29,647
maybe he knew her.

506
00:18:29,647 --> 00:18:31,524
Could be. Could be he just found

507
00:18:31,524 --> 00:18:32,942
her credit card
statements in the trash.

508
00:18:32,942 --> 00:18:34,193
It's old school, but
it's effective.

509
00:18:34,193 --> 00:18:35,361
You guys, for all we know,

510
00:18:35,361 --> 00:18:37,613
he's targeting Sleeping
Beauty as we speak.

511
00:18:37,613 --> 00:18:38,340
Yo. I got something.

512
00:18:38,407 --> 00:18:41,160
That missing hour of Kristina's
at lunch time last Friday?

513
00:18:41,202 --> 00:18:44,914
Tech found a map search on her
tablet that day at 12:50 pm--

514
00:18:44,914 --> 00:18:46,415
walking directions
to Glassman's Cafe

515
00:18:46,415 --> 00:18:47,375
on the Upper West Side.

516
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,668
Okay, great.
You guys go to the cafe.

517
00:18:48,668 --> 00:18:50,461
See if you can figure out
who she was meeting with.

518
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:51,462
On it.

519
00:18:51,462 --> 00:18:53,422
In the meantime, I'm gonna
get ahold of uniforms

520
00:18:53,422 --> 00:18:55,508
and ask them to double
foot patrols in parks.

521
00:18:55,508 --> 00:18:57,635
Only he's not gonna strike
at a park this time.

522
00:18:57,844 --> 00:18:59,762
In the Grimm stories, Red
Riding Hood and Snow White

523
00:18:59,762 --> 00:19:02,682
were found in the woods,
but Sleeping Beauty...

524
00:19:02,682 --> 00:19:05,209
Was found in her bedroom.
- Right.

525
00:19:05,283 --> 00:19:07,494
Great. So that narrows it down
to several million apartments,

526
00:19:07,494 --> 00:19:09,204
and that is just in Manhattan.

527
00:19:09,204 --> 00:19:10,747
It doesn't make sense.

528
00:19:11,623 --> 00:19:13,333
What doesn't make any sense?

529
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,584
His motive.

530
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:16,461
All serial killers
are expressing

531
00:19:16,461 --> 00:19:18,171
some psychological impulse.

532
00:19:18,171 --> 00:19:19,589
Somewhere deep down,

533
00:19:19,797 --> 00:19:22,342
there's a twistelogic
to their insanity.

534
00:19:22,342 --> 00:19:23,343
Okay. Keep going.

535
00:19:23,343 --> 00:19:24,969
In the original Grimm's tales,

536
00:19:24,969 --> 00:19:27,472
Red Riding Hood, Snow
White, Sleeping Beauty--

537
00:19:27,472 --> 00:19:28,848
they all end up near death,

538
00:19:28,848 --> 00:19:30,683
but were saved at
the last minute.

539
00:19:30,758 --> 00:19:31,634
It's like he's trying

540
00:19:31,634 --> 00:19:33,427
to take away our
victims' happy endings.

541
00:19:33,427 --> 00:19:36,555
Right. Not only that, but he
could've ordered any costume,

542
00:19:36,555 --> 00:19:37,765
but he picked these.

543
00:19:37,765 --> 00:19:38,849
He took great care
in the details--

544
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:40,726
the wolf's claw, the apple.

545
00:19:41,227 --> 00:19:43,771
He chose these
characters for a reason.

546
00:19:44,522 --> 00:19:45,856
He chose these women
for a reason.

547
00:19:45,856 --> 00:19:48,234
I just...
haven't figured it out yet.

548
00:19:48,317 --> 00:19:50,528
Well, whatever it is,
it has to be connected

549
00:19:50,528 --> 00:19:52,363
to the cash that they withdrew.

550
00:19:52,363 --> 00:19:53,965
Maybe he's choosing women
with healthy bank accounts.

551
00:19:53,965 --> 00:19:56,033
Bank.
- Sorry?

552
00:19:56,033 --> 00:19:58,619
Kristina and Amy both withdrew
the same amount of money.

553
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:00,788
Maybe our Sleeping
Beauty did as well.

554
00:20:00,421 --> 00:20:01,881
The IRS requires banks

555
00:20:01,881 --> 00:20:04,258
to report any transactions
over $10,000,

556
00:20:04,258 --> 00:20:06,302
- so they would have a record of it.
- Exactly.

557
00:20:06,427 --> 00:20:07,970
Yeah, she was here.

558
00:20:08,054 --> 00:20:09,722
It was last Friday,
during the lunch rush,

559
00:20:09,722 --> 00:20:11,932
right after I spilled
ketchup on my new jeans.

560
00:20:11,932 --> 00:20:14,477
They were 70% off--
amazing sale.

561
00:20:14,477 --> 00:20:15,728
Was she by herself?

562
00:20:15,728 --> 00:20:17,521
No, it was a party of three.

563
00:20:17,563 --> 00:20:19,857
Three? Do you remember
who else she was with?

564
00:20:19,857 --> 00:20:21,150
Two other women.

565
00:20:21,692 --> 00:20:23,611
I've never been questioned
by cops before.

566
00:20:23,611 --> 00:20:25,029
You mind if I tweet about this?

567
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:27,114
Uh, yeah, yes, we-- we do mind.

568
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,408
This one of the women?

569
00:20:30,493 --> 00:20:31,577
Yeah.

570
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:33,371
Are they criminals or something?

571
00:20:33,371 --> 00:20:35,148
'Cause I was getting more
of an Upper East Side vibe.

572
00:20:35,281 --> 00:20:37,575
No, but this third woman
may be in danger,

573
00:20:37,575 --> 00:20:39,660
so we need to identify her
as soon as possible.

574
00:20:39,785 --> 00:20:41,370
Do you remember if she maybe
paid with a credit card,

575
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,330
maybe you caught her name?

576
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,789
Nope. They paid cash.

577
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:46,334
Was anyone else
with them, a-a man?

578
00:20:46,334 --> 00:20:47,460
No.

579
00:20:47,627 --> 00:20:49,086
Did you notice anyone
watching them?

580
00:20:49,086 --> 00:20:50,129
Some of the other customers,

581
00:20:50,171 --> 00:20:52,006
- but only because they were arguing.
- About what?

582
00:20:52,006 --> 00:20:54,008
I don't know.
I kind of tried to eavesdrop,

583
00:20:54,008 --> 00:20:55,343
but every time I
went over there,

584
00:20:55,343 --> 00:20:56,761
they gave me the death stare.

585
00:20:56,761 --> 00:20:58,262
Whatever they were
talking about,

586
00:20:58,262 --> 00:20:59,805
they didn't want me to hear.

587
00:21:00,056 --> 00:21:01,807
Okay, so the IRS search

588
00:21:01,807 --> 00:21:03,309
reveals ten different
cash transactions

589
00:21:03,309 --> 00:21:06,646
between $50,000 and
$60,000 for that day.

590
00:21:06,646 --> 00:21:09,398
Two belong to our Red
Riding Hood and Snow White.

591
00:21:09,398 --> 00:21:11,525
That leaves us eight.

592
00:21:11,651 --> 00:21:13,736
Five of them were made by males,

593
00:21:13,736 --> 00:21:14,987
leaving...
three women.

594
00:21:14,964 --> 00:21:17,007
Jessica Harper, Charlotte Boyd,

595
00:21:17,007 --> 00:21:18,718
and Dana Wilson.

596
00:21:18,718 --> 00:21:20,177
Well, Harper and Wilson
are in their 50s.

597
00:21:20,177 --> 00:21:21,345
They don't fit the profile.

598
00:21:21,345 --> 00:21:22,680
Which leaves us...

599
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,973
Charlotte Boyd.

600
00:21:24,709 --> 00:21:25,293
Beckett.

601
00:21:25,293 --> 00:21:26,878
Hey, we were able to confirm

602
00:21:26,878 --> 00:21:28,421
that Kristina was
here with Amy Morgan

603
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:30,090
and a third woman last Friday.

604
00:21:30,132 --> 00:21:32,092
We think she might be our
killer's third target.

605
00:21:32,092 --> 00:21:33,051
We didn't get an ID,

606
00:21:33,051 --> 00:21:34,636
but we did get a pretty
good description.

607
00:21:34,636 --> 00:21:37,264
Let me guess--in her 20s,
brown hair, brown eyes,

608
00:21:37,264 --> 00:21:39,599
- exotic looking.
- Yeah. How'd you know?

609
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:40,767
Charlotte isn't answering.

610
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:41,852
Her name's Charlotte Boyd.

611
00:21:41,852 --> 00:21:43,228
Ryan, I'm gonna text
you her address.

612
00:21:43,228 --> 00:21:44,604
Just meet us over there.

613
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,475
Beckett!

614
00:22:28,976 --> 00:22:29,977
Castle?

615
00:22:34,774 --> 00:22:36,650
Call an ambulance.
She's still alive.

616
00:22:42,623 --> 00:22:43,707
Okay, yeah.

617
00:22:43,707 --> 00:22:46,335
Just keep me posted on her status.
Thanks.

618
00:22:46,418 --> 00:22:47,419
So that was the ER.

619
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:50,047
Charlotte is stable but
still unconscious.

620
00:22:50,047 --> 00:22:51,131
Ketamine and oxycodone?

621
00:22:51,131 --> 00:22:53,008
Yeah, and with that treatment,
her heart could've stopped.

622
00:22:53,008 --> 00:22:54,635
The doctor said we got
there just in time.

623
00:22:54,635 --> 00:22:56,136
Just like in the fairy tale.

624
00:22:56,178 --> 00:22:57,971
So, what, you're
Prince Charming now?

625
00:22:57,971 --> 00:22:59,306
Well, if the shoe fits...

626
00:22:59,598 --> 00:23:00,140
Nah.

627
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,850
I'm just glad we had
a happy ending.

628
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:04,686
Well, it won't be a happy
ending until evil is vanquished

629
00:23:04,686 --> 00:23:05,896
and locked in the dungeon.

630
00:23:05,896 --> 00:23:07,022
We're closing in on him.

631
00:23:07,022 --> 00:23:08,524
Yeah, but he's still
a step ahead.

632
00:23:09,107 --> 00:23:11,568
I'm hoping that he left some
kind of evidence behind.

633
00:23:11,568 --> 00:23:14,697
Yo. We've done a full sweep.
No sign of the $50,605.

634
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,721
A luxury condo and
that much money--

635
00:23:16,721 --> 00:23:17,930
what does this girl
do for a living?

636
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,223
She worked for a
real estate firm

637
00:23:19,223 --> 00:23:20,308
as a high-end broker.

638
00:23:20,308 --> 00:23:22,768
If you didn't have $10 mil to
plunk down on an apartment,

639
00:23:22,894 --> 00:23:24,061
she wasn't your girl.

640
00:23:24,061 --> 00:23:25,688
Okay, so we got three women,

641
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,732
all in their 20s,
all successful,

642
00:23:27,815 --> 00:23:29,775
all have a secret
meeting last Friday

643
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:33,070
and then pull the exact same
amount of cash out of the bank.

644
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,114
Maybe they were going in
on something, pulling the money.

645
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:36,782
I think we can safely
rule out lotto tickets.

646
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,201
No, there's gotta be something
that we're missing.

647
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:41,954
Hey, guys. Look at this.

648
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:44,123
I found it at the bottom of
one of Charlotte's drawers.

649
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,399
We got our connection.

650
00:23:45,483 --> 00:23:47,860
Amy, Charlotte, and Kristina--

651
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,153
our three victims.

652
00:23:49,153 --> 00:23:50,738
All dressed as
fairy-tale characters.

653
00:23:50,738 --> 00:23:52,156
Yeah, dressed as the
same characters

654
00:23:52,156 --> 00:23:53,824
that our killer dressed them as.

655
00:23:54,158 --> 00:23:55,451
Check out the date.

656
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:58,162
"05/06/05."

657
00:23:58,162 --> 00:23:59,455
That's seven years ago.

658
00:23:59,455 --> 00:24:01,707
Yeah, it's also the amount
of money they withdrew.

659
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:04,001
Yeah, 50,605 bucks.

660
00:24:04,001 --> 00:24:06,254
Yeah, and, uh, check
out the back.

661
00:24:06,254 --> 00:24:07,964
"Who's the guiltiest
of them all?

662
00:24:07,964 --> 00:24:10,075
If you pay, you'll live
to see another day."

663
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,692
They were being blackmailed?

664
00:24:11,692 --> 00:24:14,444
Okay, so something
happened on that date

665
00:24:14,444 --> 00:24:15,404
that connects them all.

666
00:24:15,404 --> 00:24:16,989
Something that led
to their murders.

667
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:18,740
So who's the guy
taking the photo?

668
00:24:19,116 --> 00:24:20,534
Maybe he can tell
us what happened.

669
00:24:20,534 --> 00:24:23,203
CSU only found one set
of prints on the photo--

670
00:24:23,203 --> 00:24:24,955
Charlotte's-- but they
were able to determine

671
00:24:24,955 --> 00:24:26,623
that it was developed
within the last two weeks.

672
00:24:26,623 --> 00:24:27,541
How can they do that?

673
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:28,709
Well, it's machine processed,

674
00:24:28,709 --> 00:24:30,294
like, you know,
from a drug store?

675
00:24:30,294 --> 00:24:31,503
And there's a control code,
autoprinted on the back.

676
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:34,673
Can we use the code to figure
out where it was processed?

677
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:35,757
Yeah, already on it.

678
00:24:35,757 --> 00:24:37,634
Hopefully, that'll get us
who ordered the prints.

679
00:24:37,793 --> 00:24:39,419
This photo was taken
seven years ago.

680
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:41,380
Why is it surfacing now?

681
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,215
Yo. You were right
about the date.

682
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:44,257
Something did happen that night.

683
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:45,300
There's even a police report.

684
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,511
I don't suppose the report
IDs our Prince Charming.

685
00:24:47,511 --> 00:24:49,888
Sure does.
His name's Owen Thomas.

686
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:51,848
But he can't be our suspect.

687
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:52,891
He's dead.

688
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,811
He was killed 7 years
ago-- May 6, 2005.

689
00:24:55,811 --> 00:24:57,104
5/06/05.

690
00:24:57,104 --> 00:24:58,438
The night that the
photo was taken.

691
00:24:58,438 --> 00:25:00,315
It's also the same night
that Owen attended

692
00:25:00,315 --> 00:25:02,317
an underground rave,
fairy-tale themed.

693
00:25:02,317 --> 00:25:04,277
He was last seen alive at 10:45.

694
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:06,947
But this picture was
taken at 11:23.

695
00:25:06,947 --> 00:25:08,407
How did he die?

696
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:10,325
Internal bleeding complicated
with high doses

697
00:25:10,325 --> 00:25:11,060
of ketamine and oxycodone.

698
00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:12,394
That explains our killer's m.o.

699
00:25:12,394 --> 00:25:14,021
Okay, so he's high
on club drugs,

700
00:25:14,021 --> 00:25:15,647
but what caused the
internal bleeding?

701
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:16,607
A car.

702
00:25:16,607 --> 00:25:18,233
His body was found on
the side of the road.

703
00:25:18,233 --> 00:25:20,027
ME wrote it up as
a hit and run.

704
00:25:20,027 --> 00:25:21,153
There were no witnesses,

705
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:23,363
so the trail went cold,
they never solved the case.

706
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,157
It's "I know what you
did last summer."

707
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:26,241
"Who's the guiltiest
of them all?"

708
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:27,743
The killer thinks that
one of these women

709
00:25:27,743 --> 00:25:28,994
is responsible for his death.

710
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:29,870
Maybe they are.

711
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:32,206
This photo proves that they were
the last ones to see him alive,

712
00:25:32,206 --> 00:25:34,249
yet none of them gave
statements to the cops.

713
00:25:34,249 --> 00:25:35,584
But why are the murders
happening now,

714
00:25:35,584 --> 00:25:37,419
- seven years later?
- Well, maybe after all these years,

715
00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:38,021
someone found this photo.

716
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:40,711
Esposito, can you look into
Owen's family and friends?

717
00:25:40,711 --> 00:25:42,796
Someone might be trying to
get payback for his death.

718
00:25:42,796 --> 00:25:43,756
You got it.

719
00:25:44,006 --> 00:25:44,882
Beckett.

720
00:25:44,882 --> 00:25:46,383
Yeah. We'll be right there.

721
00:25:46,425 --> 00:25:48,052
Sleeping Beauty just woke up.

722
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,554
Charlotte?

723
00:25:52,097 --> 00:25:55,226
I'm detective Beckett.
This is Mr. Castle.

724
00:25:55,517 --> 00:25:57,603
Do you feel well enough to
answer a few questions?

725
00:26:00,814 --> 00:26:01,857
Yeah.

726
00:26:02,775 --> 00:26:04,735
What can you tell us
about the attack?

727
00:26:05,051 --> 00:26:07,679
I was at my computer,

728
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,430
just listening to music,

729
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,599
and... the next thing you know,

730
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:13,434
I'm being pushed to the floor.

731
00:26:13,726 --> 00:26:14,978
Did you see who did it?

732
00:26:15,709 --> 00:26:16,335
No.

733
00:26:16,335 --> 00:26:18,420
They're saying--they're
saying I was drugged.

734
00:26:19,212 --> 00:26:21,048
Why would someone do this to me?

735
00:26:22,215 --> 00:26:24,134
Charlotte, I think you know why.

736
00:26:24,176 --> 00:26:28,055
All three of you reived
a copy of this photo.

737
00:26:30,057 --> 00:26:32,309
Amy and Kristina weren't
as lucky as you.

738
00:26:33,143 --> 00:26:34,436
They didn't make it.

739
00:26:36,438 --> 00:26:37,689
Oh, my God.

740
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,901
But we did what he asked.
We paid him.

741
00:26:41,021 --> 00:26:42,439
What does he have on you?

742
00:26:42,897 --> 00:26:44,983
What happened to Owen
that night?

743
00:26:49,658 --> 00:26:50,743
Charlotte?

744
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,247
It was just some stupid...

745
00:26:56,457 --> 00:26:57,791
fairy-tale rave.

746
00:26:57,833 --> 00:27:01,503
Um, we were just looking to dance and...
have fun.

747
00:27:02,046 --> 00:27:04,548
And Owen had scored
some "Special K."

748
00:27:05,132 --> 00:27:06,342
That hit is pretty hard,

749
00:27:06,342 --> 00:27:08,385
but Kristina had some
of her mom's oxy

750
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,763
and said it would even us out.

751
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:13,098
Somehow we ended
up in Amy's car,

752
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:15,100
and that's where this
picture was taken.

753
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:19,438
How did Owen end up on
the side of the road?

754
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:22,441
He was having some seriously
bad hallucinations,

755
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:23,525
just...

756
00:27:23,525 --> 00:27:26,153
screaming and--and grabbing us.

757
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:28,365
So we pulled the car over,
and we made him get out.

758
00:27:28,381 --> 00:27:30,759
We just figured, he'd
walk back to the rave.

759
00:27:31,468 --> 00:27:33,386
But it was all over the
news the next morning

760
00:27:33,386 --> 00:27:36,097
that...
that there had been a hit and run

761
00:27:36,097 --> 00:27:37,307
and that he'd been killed.

762
00:27:37,307 --> 00:27:39,267
And why didn't you come forward?

763
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:41,770
Oh, we were just kids then.

764
00:27:42,771 --> 00:27:45,190
We were scared out of our minds.
You--

765
00:27:45,404 --> 00:27:48,031
you have to understand,
we had a lot to lose.

766
00:27:48,573 --> 00:27:51,284
We came from good families, we'd
been accepted into college,

767
00:27:51,284 --> 00:27:53,620
we... we made a pact

768
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,705
and we said, we--

769
00:27:54,705 --> 00:27:56,873
we wouldn't tell anyone
what happened that night.

770
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:00,961
And that we'd never
see each other again.

771
00:28:03,046 --> 00:28:04,965
Look, I'm not excusing
how we handled it.

772
00:28:04,965 --> 00:28:07,050
We were... stupid,

773
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:10,137
but... we didn't do anything.

774
00:28:10,595 --> 00:28:12,389
Well, someone thinks you did.

775
00:28:14,057 --> 00:28:15,559
What did you do with the money?

776
00:28:17,185 --> 00:28:20,022
The note said to put
it in a dumpster

777
00:28:20,022 --> 00:28:21,732
at Bleecker and Thompson.

778
00:28:22,441 --> 00:28:25,444
We didn't want some scandal
messing up our lives, so we did it.

779
00:28:26,406 --> 00:28:27,615
We paid.

780
00:28:29,117 --> 00:28:31,327
So why did he come after us?

781
00:28:33,788 --> 00:28:36,749
Okay, the corner of
Bleecker and Thompson--

782
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:39,043
there are no security
cameras at the drop site,

783
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:41,379
and so far, no witnesses.

784
00:28:41,462 --> 00:28:42,505
He covered his bases.

785
00:28:42,505 --> 00:28:44,591
I know. It's really
starting to piss me off.

786
00:28:44,591 --> 00:28:46,676
Yeah, and you get cute
when you get angry.

787
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,262
But not when you
get angry with me.

788
00:28:49,262 --> 00:28:50,471
Yo.

789
00:28:50,471 --> 00:28:52,015
So I took a look Owen's family.

790
00:28:52,015 --> 00:28:53,600
I think I found
someone with motive.

791
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,559
Turns out he has
an older brother,

792
00:28:54,642 --> 00:28:56,144
and apparently, they were close.

793
00:28:56,144 --> 00:28:57,562
Any connection to our victims?

794
00:28:57,604 --> 00:29:00,231
Oh, yeah
see for yourself.

795
00:29:00,648 --> 00:29:03,735
Wait.
That's Leslie's husband, Darren.

796
00:29:03,735 --> 00:29:06,613
So Owen's brother is married
to our first victim's sister?

797
00:29:06,613 --> 00:29:07,906
What are the odds, right?

798
00:29:07,947 --> 00:29:10,366
Maybe Darren somehow found
out that his wife's sister

799
00:29:10,366 --> 00:29:12,160
was responsible for his
brother Owen's death.

800
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,995
Well, maybe the families just
knew each other socially.

801
00:29:13,995 --> 00:29:15,330
It doesn't mean that
Darren's our killer.

802
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,956
Oh, that doesn't,
but this might.

803
00:29:16,956 --> 00:29:19,208
CSU tracked down where
the photo was processed.

804
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:20,168
It's from a roll of film,

805
00:29:20,168 --> 00:29:22,378
and the guy who dropped it
off had three copies made.

806
00:29:22,378 --> 00:29:24,547
And does the guy's
description match Darren's?

807
00:29:24,547 --> 00:29:27,133
Even better.
They had security cameras.

808
00:29:29,235 --> 00:29:30,487
It's him.

809
00:29:31,262 --> 00:29:34,557
I got here as fast as I could.
So is there any news?

810
00:29:34,557 --> 00:29:37,101
Did you find out who
did this to my sister?

811
00:29:38,603 --> 00:29:40,146
Uh, first let me ask,

812
00:29:40,563 --> 00:29:43,858
what was Amy's relationship
with your husband's brother--

813
00:29:43,858 --> 00:29:44,942
Owen?

814
00:29:45,067 --> 00:29:46,569
They were high school friends.

815
00:29:46,777 --> 00:29:47,987
We all were.

816
00:29:48,417 --> 00:29:50,044
What does this have
to do with Amy?

817
00:29:50,586 --> 00:29:52,088
Owen died years ago.

818
00:29:52,088 --> 00:29:53,756
You ever see this before?

819
00:29:56,467 --> 00:29:57,677
No.

820
00:30:01,055 --> 00:30:03,808
That's Amy,
and that's Owen.

821
00:30:04,183 --> 00:30:05,643
These two I don't know.

822
00:30:05,582 --> 00:30:07,750
It's from the night
that he was killed.

823
00:30:08,376 --> 00:30:09,544
Okay.

824
00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:13,172
Your husband Darren had it
printed up two weeks ago.

825
00:30:13,172 --> 00:30:15,133
Do you have any
idea how he got it?

826
00:30:15,258 --> 00:30:16,676
Last month,

827
00:30:16,968 --> 00:30:18,803
we were cleaning
out my dad's attic

828
00:30:18,803 --> 00:30:22,265
and found a camera with
a roll of film inside.

829
00:30:23,028 --> 00:30:25,739
Darren thought it would be
fun to see what was on it.

830
00:30:27,407 --> 00:30:29,868
You--you don't think he had
anything to do with Amy...

831
00:30:32,913 --> 00:30:34,081
Do you?

832
00:30:34,081 --> 00:30:35,499
I don't know what you
guys are talking about.

833
00:30:35,499 --> 00:30:37,084
I didn't blackmail anybody.

834
00:30:37,084 --> 00:30:40,087
All right, so then you don't
recognize this photo?

835
00:30:41,922 --> 00:30:42,923
Absolutely not.

836
00:30:42,923 --> 00:30:44,258
And then...

837
00:30:44,258 --> 00:30:46,760
this isn't you, is it, Darren?

838
00:30:48,752 --> 00:30:50,879
I can only imagine how
you must have felt.

839
00:30:50,879 --> 00:30:53,757
After all these years, realizing
your own sister-in-law

840
00:30:53,757 --> 00:30:55,634
might be involved in
your brother's death.

841
00:30:55,634 --> 00:30:58,345
We found the cash in your
storage locker in Queens--

842
00:30:58,345 --> 00:31:01,890
$151,815.

843
00:31:01,932 --> 00:31:03,475
Which, by wild coincidence,

844
00:31:03,475 --> 00:31:08,146
is exactly $50,605 times 3.

845
00:31:10,648 --> 00:31:13,401
Owen was high.
He was messed up.

846
00:31:13,401 --> 00:31:14,861
They knew that, and
what did they do?

847
00:31:14,861 --> 00:31:16,070
They left him there.

848
00:31:19,532 --> 00:31:20,908
You could've gone to the police.

849
00:31:20,908 --> 00:31:22,577
Because they did
such a bang-up job

850
00:31:22,577 --> 00:31:23,911
the first time around?

851
00:31:24,704 --> 00:31:25,747
I just wanted them to pay

852
00:31:25,747 --> 00:31:27,790
something for what they did.

853
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:29,584
I was even gonna use the money

854
00:31:29,584 --> 00:31:31,669
to set up a scholarship
fund in Owen's name.

855
00:31:31,669 --> 00:31:34,297
Really, a scholarship fund?

856
00:31:34,297 --> 00:31:36,299
And what's your spin on murder?

857
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:37,675
The money wasn't enough.

858
00:31:37,675 --> 00:31:39,260
You wanted revenge.

859
00:31:39,469 --> 00:31:41,929
You wanted them to die
like your brother,

860
00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:43,598
dressed in fairy-tale costumes,

861
00:31:43,598 --> 00:31:46,100
ODing on the same drugs he did.

862
00:31:46,267 --> 00:31:48,394
What? No.

863
00:31:48,591 --> 00:31:50,426
I don't know who killed
them, but it wasn't me.

864
00:31:50,426 --> 00:31:52,052
That's gonna be tough
to believe, Darren.

865
00:31:52,052 --> 00:31:54,847
You had motive, you blamed
them for Owen's death,

866
00:31:54,847 --> 00:31:57,391
and you just admitted
to blackmailing them.

867
00:32:01,103 --> 00:32:02,396
I want a lawyer.

868
00:32:06,233 --> 00:32:07,568
Of course you do.

869
00:32:09,445 --> 00:32:11,071
Darren doesn't need a lawyer.

870
00:32:11,071 --> 00:32:13,908
He needs a miracle.

871
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:16,452
His wife told Ryan that

872
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:19,580
he wasn't at the house when
the murders were committed.

873
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,790
So that's it then.

874
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,358
Yeah, for this case.

875
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:25,987
We did everything but tie
a bow on it for the DA.

876
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:27,864
Right this way, Ms. Morgan.

877
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,122
Is it true, Darren?

878
00:32:36,205 --> 00:32:37,415
Is it true?

879
00:32:37,874 --> 00:32:40,001
Look me in the eyes and
tell me it's not true!

880
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:40,793
No, babe. I didn't hurt anyone.

881
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:42,670
You blackmailed my sister!

882
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,630
- You lied to me. You--
- No, l-listen.

883
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,966
I'm telling you the truth, okay?
I didn't kill anyone.

884
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:47,925
I just wanted them to pay.

885
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:50,011
Who would do it then?
You had the picture.

886
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:51,596
- No, no! Babe, I swear--
- Oh, my God. It was you!

887
00:32:51,596 --> 00:32:52,930
- I swear. I swear. Babe--
- You know what?

888
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,390
You need to get away
from me...

889
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,099
- Babe--
- Right now!

890
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:55,892
Listen!

891
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,144
- Les--
- Stay away.

892
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:04,668
Murder does more damage to
the living than to the dead.

893
00:33:04,668 --> 00:33:07,420
Yeah, all because of
a terrible secret.

894
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,838
Well, secrets are
like time bombs.

895
00:33:08,838 --> 00:33:11,424
Yeah, eventually, they...
explode.

896
00:33:14,177 --> 00:33:16,179
You know, Castle, I'm not saying
that I condone what Darren did,

897
00:33:16,179 --> 00:33:18,014
but I do understand it.

898
00:33:18,181 --> 00:33:21,309
Yeah. No, I understand
wanting revenge.

899
00:33:21,518 --> 00:33:23,270
The way he went about it
doesn't add up, though.

900
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,271
What do you mean?

901
00:33:24,309 --> 00:33:27,937
Well, blackmail
is revenge from a distance.

902
00:33:27,937 --> 00:33:29,189
Murder is up close and personal.

903
00:33:29,189 --> 00:33:30,356
It doesn't make sense
he would do both.

904
00:33:30,356 --> 00:33:31,524
Don't underestimate him.

905
00:33:31,524 --> 00:33:34,402
I mean, the only reason
that he copped to blackmail

906
00:33:34,402 --> 00:33:36,488
was to avoid murder charges.

907
00:33:36,488 --> 00:33:38,740
And like any psychopath,
he's a great actor.

908
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,992
- Oh, speaking of...
- Psychopaths or actors?

909
00:33:40,992 --> 00:33:43,203
- I-I was thinking about your mom.
- Oh, so a little of both.

910
00:33:43,203 --> 00:33:44,871
I think we can make the play.

911
00:33:44,871 --> 00:33:45,997
Really?

912
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:48,875
So you want to venture into
the dark, scary woods?

913
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:50,752
Don't worry, Castle.
I got a gun.

914
00:33:50,752 --> 00:33:52,337
I'll protect you from
the big bad wolf.

915
00:33:52,337 --> 00:33:54,047
You'd use your gun on my mother?

916
00:33:54,228 --> 00:33:55,521
I'm touched.

917
00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:56,855
Thank you.

918
00:34:02,361 --> 00:34:03,487
Ah, thank you.

919
00:34:03,737 --> 00:34:05,698
Oh, wow, Castle.
This is quite the soiree.

920
00:34:05,698 --> 00:34:07,324
Yeah, it's a family trait.

921
00:34:07,366 --> 00:34:09,076
We tend to go big. Cheers.

922
00:34:09,076 --> 00:34:10,160
Cheers.

923
00:34:13,706 --> 00:34:16,083
- Would you excuse me a moment?
- Yeah.

924
00:34:16,615 --> 00:34:17,783
Hey.

925
00:34:18,742 --> 00:34:19,826
Hey. You came.

926
00:34:19,826 --> 00:34:22,120
Oh, it means so much
to me, darling.

927
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,288
She was worried you
wouldn't make it.

928
00:34:23,288 --> 00:34:24,331
Break a leg, mother.

929
00:34:24,331 --> 00:34:26,833
We have a schedule to keep.
Curtain in two minutes.

930
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:28,794
I can't get this bow straight.

931
00:34:28,794 --> 00:34:30,504
Allow me. Allow me.

932
00:34:32,047 --> 00:34:33,840
Oh, maybe I should
have Alexis do it.

933
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,801
I mean, how many bows have
you tied in your lifetime?

934
00:34:35,801 --> 00:34:37,636
Well, I tie my shoes every day.

935
00:34:37,636 --> 00:34:38,679
If you remember, you taught me.

936
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,681
Yeah, yeah, true.

937
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:43,100
The bow.

938
00:34:44,017 --> 00:34:45,143
The bow was tied incorrectly.

939
00:34:45,143 --> 00:34:47,521
Well, I told you, we
should've had Alexis do it.

940
00:34:47,521 --> 00:34:50,649
Not your bow. The other bow.
The one on her costume.

941
00:34:50,649 --> 00:34:52,317
We arrested the wrong man.

942
00:34:53,615 --> 00:34:55,617
What? I-I don't understand.

943
00:34:55,617 --> 00:34:57,536
So you're saying
Darren didn't do it?

944
00:34:57,536 --> 00:34:58,787
Well, he's guilty of blackmail,

945
00:34:58,787 --> 00:35:00,122
but that's as far as it goes.

946
00:35:00,122 --> 00:35:01,289
So what if the killer's
still out there?

947
00:35:01,289 --> 00:35:02,499
What if he comes after me?

948
00:35:02,499 --> 00:35:03,583
He won't.

949
00:35:04,084 --> 00:35:06,670
We have officers outside 24/7.

950
00:35:07,212 --> 00:35:08,046
We'll find him, Charlotte.

951
00:35:08,046 --> 00:35:10,799
We just, um,
we need a bit of your help.

952
00:35:10,799 --> 00:35:13,010
Of course. Whatever I can do.

953
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:17,889
Well, we think that the key
to finding the real killer

954
00:35:17,889 --> 00:35:20,475
is through understanding
exactly what happened

955
00:35:20,475 --> 00:35:21,685
the night of Owen's death.

956
00:35:21,685 --> 00:35:23,154
Can you answer a few questions?

957
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,056
Y-yeah. I mean, I guess so,

958
00:35:24,056 --> 00:35:26,392
though I'm pretty sure I
told you everything I know.

959
00:35:26,433 --> 00:35:28,185
Well, last time we spoke,
you said that everyone

960
00:35:28,185 --> 00:35:29,353
was in Amy's car?

961
00:35:29,353 --> 00:35:30,354
Right.

962
00:35:30,354 --> 00:35:31,772
And who was driving?

963
00:35:31,814 --> 00:35:33,983
She was. Why?

964
00:35:34,149 --> 00:35:35,818
Well, we did a little checking.

965
00:35:35,818 --> 00:35:36,777
The day after Owen died,

966
00:35:36,777 --> 00:35:38,320
Amy brought her car
to a body shop.

967
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,322
She had a broken grille
and a dented bumper.

968
00:35:40,322 --> 00:35:42,366
Any idea how she
got those dents?

969
00:35:43,178 --> 00:35:45,097
Charlotte, what really
happened that night?

970
00:35:45,305 --> 00:35:47,975
Did Owen try to get
back into the car?

971
00:35:47,975 --> 00:35:49,434
Maybe Amy panicked,

972
00:35:49,851 --> 00:35:53,021
accidentally hitting
him as she drove away?

973
00:35:56,733 --> 00:35:57,901
Charlotte?

974
00:35:59,236 --> 00:36:01,363
I begged Amy to go back.

975
00:36:01,738 --> 00:36:02,698
Kristina and I both did.

976
00:36:02,698 --> 00:36:05,033
We begged her, but she
just kept driving.

977
00:36:05,158 --> 00:36:06,243
She didn't mean to hurt him.

978
00:36:06,243 --> 00:36:08,370
It was just an accident.

979
00:36:08,976 --> 00:36:11,770
That's the truth.
That's what really happened.

980
00:36:11,979 --> 00:36:13,105
Is it?

981
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,608
Take a look

982
00:36:17,401 --> 00:36:18,485
at how the bows

983
00:36:18,485 --> 00:36:21,738
are tied on the victims' stumes.

984
00:36:23,907 --> 00:36:25,242
What about them?

985
00:36:25,575 --> 00:36:27,160
Well, the killer tied these bows

986
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,996
after the victims were drugged.

987
00:36:29,663 --> 00:36:30,831
See how they look,

988
00:36:30,831 --> 00:36:34,876
how the loops are
pleasingly horizontal?

989
00:36:35,252 --> 00:36:39,006
Now... look at the bow on
your Sleeping Beauty outfit.

990
00:36:39,851 --> 00:36:41,477
See how the loops are vertical?

991
00:36:42,353 --> 00:36:43,563
It's a little weird.

992
00:36:43,688 --> 00:36:45,815
I mean, if the killer
tied all three bows,

993
00:36:45,815 --> 00:36:47,650
why would yours be different?

994
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:51,863
It's because you tied
all three bows.

995
00:36:51,863 --> 00:36:55,158
This one is different because
you tied it on yourself

996
00:36:55,158 --> 00:36:56,367
behind your back.

997
00:36:56,367 --> 00:36:58,578
No. I was attacked.

998
00:36:58,578 --> 00:37:00,038
I am a victim.

999
00:37:00,121 --> 00:37:01,914
Yet, your doctor
said you received

1000
00:37:01,914 --> 00:37:04,375
half the dose of oxy that
the other girls got,

1001
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:05,585
a nonlethal dose.

1002
00:37:05,585 --> 00:37:06,878
How soon after we pulled up

1003
00:37:06,878 --> 00:37:09,339
outside of your building did
you give yourself that shot?

1004
00:37:09,339 --> 00:37:10,590
This is crazy.

1005
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:12,634
Why would I fake an
attack on myself?

1006
00:37:12,634 --> 00:37:13,718
So no one would suspect you

1007
00:37:13,718 --> 00:37:15,678
of silencing the only two
witnesses to your crime.

1008
00:37:15,678 --> 00:37:17,555
What are you talking about?

1009
00:37:17,597 --> 00:37:19,974
At the time, Kristina and Amy

1010
00:37:19,974 --> 00:37:22,060
were willing to
bury your secret,

1011
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:25,205
but then...
this photo showed up.

1012
00:37:25,219 --> 00:37:26,512
I mean, how long could
you expect them

1013
00:37:26,512 --> 00:37:27,346
to keep the secret,

1014
00:37:27,346 --> 00:37:29,390
especially since
you were at fault?

1015
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,642
All you could think
about was the scandal--

1016
00:37:31,642 --> 00:37:35,312
jail, how it would
ruin your life--

1017
00:37:35,604 --> 00:37:37,857
all because Kristina and
Amy knew the truth.

1018
00:37:37,857 --> 00:37:39,191
Charlotte,

1019
00:37:39,441 --> 00:37:41,945
you were behind the
wheel in Amy's car.

1020
00:37:41,952 --> 00:37:43,370
It was you

1021
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:46,331
that hit and killed Owen.

1022
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:48,792
No, Amy was driving. I told you.

1023
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:51,670
Then why did you pay
for the car repairs?

1024
00:37:53,005 --> 00:37:54,840
We have the receipt.

1025
00:38:06,602 --> 00:38:09,521
You don't know what
happened that night.

1026
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:11,398
You can't prove that I hit Owen,

1027
00:38:11,398 --> 00:38:15,569
and you can't prove that I
killed Amy or Kristina.

1028
00:38:16,487 --> 00:38:17,821
Yes, I can.

1029
00:38:18,197 --> 00:38:19,698
Your firm handled the
reverse mortgage

1030
00:38:19,698 --> 00:38:22,493
of an old woman named
Jamie Isaacson.

1031
00:38:23,035 --> 00:38:25,788
She paid closing costs
with her credit card.

1032
00:38:25,788 --> 00:38:27,623
That's the same credit card

1033
00:38:27,623 --> 00:38:31,627
that you used to pay for
all three costumes.

1034
00:38:33,629 --> 00:38:35,214
Charlotte Boyd, you
are under arrest

1035
00:38:35,214 --> 00:38:37,341
for the murders of Amy Morgan...

1036
00:38:37,341 --> 00:38:38,467
Kristina Curtis,

1037
00:38:38,467 --> 00:38:41,679
and the wrongful death
of Owen Thomas.

1038
00:38:44,641 --> 00:38:45,976
The bows?

1039
00:38:46,685 --> 00:38:48,019
Seriously?

1040
00:38:52,399 --> 00:38:54,568
She's actually the perfect
fairy-tale villain.

1041
00:38:54,568 --> 00:38:55,527
Like the big bad wolf,

1042
00:38:55,527 --> 00:38:56,903
she disguised herself
as an innocent,

1043
00:38:56,903 --> 00:38:59,322
but like Snow White's
evil stepmother,

1044
00:38:59,322 --> 00:39:01,032
she was willing to do
anything, even kill,

1045
00:39:01,032 --> 00:39:02,325
to protect her image.

1046
00:39:02,325 --> 00:39:03,493
After all these years,

1047
00:39:03,493 --> 00:39:05,704
maybe Owen's family can have
some closure about his death.

1048
00:39:05,704 --> 00:39:06,788
Yeah, but at what cost?

1049
00:39:06,788 --> 00:39:07,831
Two women are dead,

1050
00:39:07,831 --> 00:39:09,541
Darren's still being
charged with blackmail,

1051
00:39:09,541 --> 00:39:10,792
and I'm sure his
marriage is over.

1052
00:39:10,792 --> 00:39:12,836
Well, and that's why
we need fairy tales

1053
00:39:12,836 --> 00:39:14,504
in the face of too much reality,

1054
00:39:14,504 --> 00:39:17,674
to remind us that happy
endings are still possible.

1055
00:39:17,674 --> 00:39:19,009
All right.
See you in the morning.

1056
00:39:19,009 --> 00:39:20,594
- Later.
- Vale.

1057
00:39:20,635 --> 00:39:21,928
Speaking of fairy tales,

1058
00:39:21,928 --> 00:39:24,765
my mother is ready to give
her encore performance.

1059
00:39:24,848 --> 00:39:26,183
Time to go back into the woods?

1060
00:39:26,183 --> 00:39:27,642
Still got your gun?

1061
00:39:28,123 --> 00:39:30,393
It was the opportunity

1062
00:39:30,453 --> 00:39:31,496
of a lifetime--

1063
00:39:31,496 --> 00:39:32,956
the chance to originate the role

1064
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:35,292
of the Wicked Witch on Broadway.

1065
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:37,711
But it would mean
being away from home

1066
00:39:37,711 --> 00:39:39,671
six nights a week, two matinees.

1067
00:39:39,671 --> 00:39:42,007
Huh. What was I to do?

1068
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:43,925
Realize that none of
it ever happened?

1069
00:39:43,925 --> 00:39:46,887
Francis Bacon once wrote,

1070
00:39:46,887 --> 00:39:49,222
"He that hath children

1071
00:39:49,222 --> 00:39:52,601
hath given hostages to fortune."

1072
00:39:52,642 --> 00:39:55,937
Well, if I was a hostage,
then my son Richard

1073
00:39:55,937 --> 00:39:57,689
was my captor,

1074
00:39:57,689 --> 00:39:59,608
my enslaver.

1075
00:39:59,608 --> 00:40:00,942
Hey, I'm right here.

1076
00:40:00,942 --> 00:40:05,614
I turned down the role,
turned my back on fortune.

1077
00:40:05,614 --> 00:40:06,698
And...

1078
00:40:06,698 --> 00:40:08,992
it was the best career
move I ever made,

1079
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:12,370
for an even greater
role came my way.

1080
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,872
A part--

1081
00:40:13,872 --> 00:40:18,210
perhaps the greatest role
that I have ever played--

1082
00:40:18,251 --> 00:40:19,461
that...

1083
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:21,171
of mother.

1084
00:40:22,015 --> 00:40:23,141
That's sweet.

1085
00:40:23,141 --> 00:40:24,726
You're right. That is sweet.

1086
00:40:24,726 --> 00:40:25,894
Shh.

1087
00:40:26,436 --> 00:40:27,145
Sorry.

1088
00:40:27,145 --> 00:40:29,147
Now if Richard

1089
00:40:29,147 --> 00:40:33,151
had only been able to
embrace the role of son

1090
00:40:33,151 --> 00:40:35,946
with the same level
of commitment.

1091
00:40:35,946 --> 00:40:38,448
And into the woods we go.

1092
00:40:40,158 --> 00:40:45,997
