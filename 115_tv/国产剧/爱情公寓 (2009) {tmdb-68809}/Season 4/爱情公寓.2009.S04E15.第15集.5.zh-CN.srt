《靈書妙探》前情提要
Previously on "Castle"...

19
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,030
舉起手來  托馬斯·蓋奇  你被鋪了
Hands in the air. Thomas Gage, you're under arrest.

20
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,410
你們掌握的有關我的證據都會消失無蹤
Everything that you have on me, it's all going away.

21
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,500
我也很想知道他是怎么從你們眼皮子底下
I'm very interested in knowing how he got out of

22
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,480
從牢房溜出去的
that holding cell on your watch.

23
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,160
卡塞爾
Castle...

24
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,060
里克·卡塞爾也有詞窮的時候
Rick Castle at a loss for words.

25
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,150
索菲亞·特納
Sophia Turner.

26
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,000
你好  里克
Hello, Rick.

27
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,510
你是德瑞克·斯道姆系列小說里的
You're Clara Strike from

28
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:21,170
克萊拉·斯瑞克
the Derrick Storm books?

29
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,620
歡迎來到中情局
Welcome to the CIA.

30
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,520
蓋奇曾是我們的王牌特工
Gage was our most effective asset.

31
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:25,460
他變節了
He went rogue.

32
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,070
潘朵拉是蓋奇任務的代號
Pandora is the code name for gage's mission.

33
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,590
他是誰
Who is he?

34
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:29,950
尼爾森·布萊克利博士
Dr. Nelson Blakely.

35
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:30,810
他來了
There he is.

36
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,260
他曾是中情局的傳奇
He was a legend at the agency.

37
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:35,150
他的方法是找到能引起
His approach was to find a small event

38
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,380
大沖突的小事件
that could trigger a large event.

39
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,950
布萊克利是策劃潘朵拉的人
Blakely is the one who planned pandora.

40
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,710
那將遠超出最壞的設想
This is beyond a worst-case scenario.

41
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,690
布萊克利博士  到底是怎么回事
Dr. Blakely, what's going on?

42
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,350
我發現了一個關鍵環節
I found a linchpin

43
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,400
將會給我們的國家帶來毀滅
that will bring about the end of our country as we know it.

44
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,540
-布萊克利博士  -他們來了
- Dr. Blakely - they're here.

45
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,480
等等  等一下
Wait! Wait!

46
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,930
-貝克特  -卡塞爾
- Beckett! - Castle!

47
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,180
這邊門打不開了
This door won't open.

48
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,460
我這邊也是
Yeah, mine won't either.

49
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,030
門框被撞變形了
I think the crash bent the frame.

50
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,400
我們得找點東西把玻璃打碎
We need something to break the glass.

51
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,480
我的槍
My gun.

52
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,940
卡塞爾  我
Castle, I can't...

53
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:17,790
我找不到
I can't find it.

54
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,460
可能是我們撞車的時候被撞飛了
I-I think it got knocked out when we got hit.

55
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,790
幫我找找
Help me look for it.

56
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,060
我被卡住了
I'm stuck.

57
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,230
什么叫你被卡住了
What do you mean, you're stuck?

58
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,720
我的安全帶打不開了
I mean, my belt is jammed.

59
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,540
座位也動不了
And the seat won't move.

60
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,180
刀子呢  你有刀嗎
Okay, what about a knife? Do you have a knife?

61
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,350
有
Yeah.

62
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,960
在后車廂里
In the trunk.

63
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,080
聽著  我們沒時間了
Okay, look, we're running out of time.

64
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,160
你得看看能不能找到槍
I need you to see if you can find that gun,

65
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,190
然后我們把安全打斷
and we'll just shoot the belt off.

66
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,250
我摸不到
I can't feel it.

67
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,440
-卡塞爾  -等等  等等
- Castle. - Okay, hang on. Hang on.

68
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,010
待著別動
Okay. Just stay here.

69
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,760
我找到了
I found it.

70
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,850
卡塞爾
Castle?

71
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,650
卡塞爾
Castle!

72
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,460
我想有女兒在犯罪現場的好處
I guess the good thing about having your daughter at crime scenes is,

73
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,770
就是她能給你帶干衣服
she can bring you dry clothes.

74
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,590
謝了
Thanks.

75
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,040
還有
And, um...

76
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,690
謝謝
Thanks.

77
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,530
你也會為我這么做的
You'd have done the same for me.

78
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,410
是啊
Yeah.

79
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,620
可能吧
Probably.

80
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,690
我只是很高興你找到了我的槍
I'm just glad you found my gun.

81
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,930
車掉水里這事
that whole, uh, sinking car thing--

82
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,800
看電影比親身體驗爽多了
much cooler in movies than it is in real life.

83
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,680
我也想說  我還是更喜歡間諜片而不是參與其中
And for the record, I prefer watching spy thrillers to being in them.

84
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,040
好吧
So...

85
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,730
老實交代
Tell me...

86
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,760
為什么你們的受害人長得那么像
How can your victim look like Nelson Blakely

87
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,020
本應死了十年的尼爾森·布萊克利
when he supposedly died ten years ago?

88
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,210
是啊  我
Yeah, I...

89
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,680
是啊  很奇怪不是嗎
Yeah, weird, isn't it?

90
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,940
是  奇了怪了
Yeah. Weird.

91
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,850
假死  汽車落水
Fake deaths, car in the water--

92
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,070
你們就不覺得現在
Don't you think now is a good time

93
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,910
應該告訴我們到底怎么回事嗎
to tell us what the hell is going on?

94
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,620
不好意思  哈維爾
Uh... I'm sorry, Javi.

95
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,050
機密行動
It's classified.

96
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,950
我在特種部隊待過
I was special forces.

97
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,890
機密行動以前是我的家常便飯
I used to eat classified for breakfast.

98
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,540
這個作家小子為什么就能知道
And yet writer boy can know?

99
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,800
好吧  我去那邊跟海港巡邏隊一起
Okay. I'll be over there with harbor patrol

100
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,010
看怎么把你的車從水里撈出來
trying to figure out how to get your unit out of the drink.

101
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,570
很高興你們沒事
I'm glad you're okay.

102
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,950
謝謝
Thank you.

103
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,150
作家小子
Writer boy?

104
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,340
-你覺得兇手是蓋奇  -對
- So you think our shooter was Gage? - Yeah.

105
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,560
我覺得他在除掉每一個
I think he's getting rid of anyone

106
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,330
會暴露他變節行動的人
that could expose his rogue operations.

107
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:45,410
他干的真是不錯啊
Well, he's doing a pretty good job.

108
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,100
我們到現在都不知道潘朵拉是什么
We still have no idea what Pandora is.

109
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,580
我們知道布萊克利害怕了
Well, we know that Blakely was afraid.

110
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,240
我們也知道他在進行一些
And we know that he was working on something

111
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,350
足以威脅國家未來的研究
that was big enough to threaten the future of this country.

112
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,060
我們只是不知道他在研究什么
We just don't know what the hell he was working on.

113
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,000
他的生活中一定有些線索
There's gotta be a clue somewhere in his life.

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,910
或許他尸體能泄露點玄機
Maybe there's something on the body that will tell us.

115
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,310
不  我們檢查過了  他兜里什么都沒有
No. We checked. There was nothing in his pockets.

116
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,120
不過從衣兜被翻出來的樣子可以猜測
But the way they were turned out makes me think

117
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,880
有人翻找過并把里面的東西拿走了
someone went through and emptied them.

118
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,970
蓋奇
Gage.

119
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,890
萊恩  找人搜查一下建筑物
Ryan, get some teams to search the building.

120
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,210
-我們要找什么  -我也不知道
- What are we looking for? - I don't know.

121
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,940
但是他帶我們過來總是有原因的
But he brought us here for a reason.

122
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,440
蕾妮  你能不能從他身上發現點什么
Lanie, see what you can find on him--

123
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,750
牙齒  傷疤  指紋  紋身
Dental, scars, prints, tattoos,

124
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,760
任何能告訴我們
anything that might tell us--

125
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,030
-他死了  -是啊
- He's dead. - Yeah.

126
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,350
聽著  我能解釋
Look, I can explain.

127
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,730
上車
Get in the car.

128
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,840
你們在做什么
What the hell did you think you were doing?

129
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,810
你想讓我們做的  找布萊克利
What you wanted, finding blakely.

130
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,180
你破解了他的密碼就不想著來告訴我一聲嗎
You cracked his code and you didn't even think to notify me?

131
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,510
我得為卡塞爾說句話
Look, in Castle's defense,

132
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,640
這事希望渺茫
it was a long shot,

133
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,960
他不想自己判斷錯誤而浪費了你的時間
and he didn't want to waste your time if he was wrong.

134
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,930
何況當時我們正要帶他過來
And we were bringing the guy in...

135
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,790
卻被人殺了  還是在你的監護下
When he was killed, in your custody.

136
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,150
你們在碼頭做什么
What were you doing at the docks?

137
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,100
-他讓我們帶他去的  -為什么
- He asked us to take him there. - Why?

138
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,290
我們不知道
We don't know.

139
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,210
你們問出任何事來了嗎
Well, did you learn anything?

140
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,190
問出來了
Yes.

141
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:03,980
他受雇分析美國的弱點
He was hired to analyze the United States for vulnerabilities.

142
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,640
他說他發現了經濟方面的一個漏洞
He said he found a weakness in our economy--

143
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,790
一個令人意想不到的關鍵
an unexpected linchpin--that,

144
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,290
如果有人攻擊此處  多米諾骨牌就會接連倒下
if someone went after it, would start the dominos falling.

145
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,520
會引發什么后果
Falling toward what?

146
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,520
國家會整個崩潰
The end of our country as we know it.

147
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,120
那我們下一步做什么
So what's our next move?

148
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,900
沒有下一步了
There is no next move.

149
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,590
至少你們倆沒有
Not for you two.

150
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,990
讓你們參與此事就是個錯誤
It was a mistake bringing you into the loop.

151
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,990
我本來以為
You know, I really thought--

152
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,580
我以為你有改變
I really thought you had changed.

153
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:28,230
結果呢
But you know what?

154
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,330
你還跟以前一樣
You are the same reckless,

155
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,760
是個魯莽  幼稚  自我為中心的混蛋
immature, self-centered jackass that you always were,

156
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,230
你將整個調查置于危險之中
and you've put this investigation at risk.

157
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,450
-對不起  -對不起
Look, I'm sorry-- you're sorry?

158
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,980
我們面臨的是下一個911  或許更糟
We are on the verge of the next 9/11 or worse.

159
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,450
這不是你寫的書  里克
This isn't one of your damn books, Rick.

160
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,540
這是真實生活  如果出了問題
This is real life, and when things go bad,

161
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,320
你不能像對我們的事那樣改寫個結局了事
you can't just rewrite the ending like you did with us.

162
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,030
把他們帶出去
Get them both out of here.

163
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,740
這么說  你跟她睡過了
So...You slept with her.

164
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:04,600
是是  我跟她睡了
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I slept with her.

165
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,160
還有別人嗎
Have there been others?

166
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,960
-女人嗎  -你的繆斯
- Women? - Muses.

167
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,690
沒了  怎么
No. Why?

168
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,150
我就想看看繆斯俱樂部到底有多少人
I just wanted to see how big the club was. That's all.

169
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,020
同志們  有進展嗎
Hey, guys. What do you got?

170
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,300
首先  根本就沒有這么個俱樂部
First off, there is no club.

171
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,910
其次  我們不跟這個案子了  記得嗎
And second, we're off the case if you recall.

172
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:23,470
是不跟他們查了  我自己還有個兇殺案
We're off their case. I still have a murder to solve.

173
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,830
可你的主要嫌疑犯恰好
Where your chief suspect

174
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,890
是中情局行動中牽涉到的人
is smack-dab in the middle of a CIA operation.

175
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,750
我才不管他牽涉到哪里
I don't care what he's in the middle of.

176
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,810
托馬斯·蓋奇殺了三個人
Thomas Gage killed three people.

177
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,670
其中一人當時還是由我監護
One of them was in my custody.

178
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,650
他把我們關在車后備箱里
He locked us in a trunk

179
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,900
他還把我的警車撞進了哈德孫河里
and then he sent my cruiser to the bottom of the hudson.

180
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,040
蓋奇是個訓練有素的秘密特工
Gage is a trained covert operative.

181
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,670
你不可能抓到他的
There's no way you can catch him.

182
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,310
我可以  只要想出來他下面會去哪
Yes, I can, if I figure out where he was going.

183
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:44,420
我們查明布萊克利在研究什么
We find out what Blakely was working on,

184
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,210
從而找到那個關鍵點
we find the linchpin.

185
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,720
找到關鍵點  就能找到蓋奇
We find the linchpin, we find Gage.

186
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,440
在倉庫找到什么了嗎
Anything on the warehouse?

187
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,580
有啊  你們倆走了之后  聯調局的人來了
Yeah, right after you guys left, the feds showed up

188
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,420
中止了我們的調查
and shut us down.

189
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,440
不過我們查到了死者尼爾森·布萊克利的一些信息
But we did find something on your vic Nelson Blakely.

190
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,040
他的指紋和長島的斯科特·麥克格雷格相吻合
His prints came back as a Scott McGregor from long island city.

191
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,330
問題是  這個麥克格雷格貌似只存在于文件上
Problem is, McGregor seems to only exist on paper.

192
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,000
我們在現實世界里查不到他的蹤跡
We can't find any trace of him in the real world.

193
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,190
你們派人去列出的地址盤查了嗎
Did you guys send units to the listed address?

194
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,690
去了  住在那的人說從沒聽說過他
Yeah, and the family living there had never heard of him,

195
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,020
也沒人認得他的照片
and no one recognized his photo.

196
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,700
肯定有人認識他
Well, someone must have known him.

197
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,690
是有人認識
Someone did.

198
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,470
他玩象棋  象棋沒法一個人玩
He plays chess. That's not a solo sport.

199
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,040
你不是不跟這案子了嗎
I thought you were off the case.

200
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,670
你聽到索菲亞怎么說我的了
Well, you heard what Sophia said.

201
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:28,020
一個魯莽  幼稚  自我為中心的混蛋
I'm a reckless, immature, self-centered jackass.

202
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,180
如果你固執到一定要繼續查的地步
If you're stubborn enough to keep going,

203
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,110
那我就笨到跟著你繼續的地步
I'm stupid enough to go with you.

204
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,950
好吧  你們去排查一下城里所有的象棋公園
All right. You guys canvass all of the chess parks in the city.

205
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,390
看看能不能找到跟他對過弈的人
Let's see if we can dig up some of his opponents.

206
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,610
貝克特
Beckett.

207
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,490
什么
What?

208
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,450
什么叫"尸體就沒來"
What do you mean, the body never arrived?

209
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,080
他們中途把尸體攔截了
They intercepted it at transport.

210
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,880
他們申請到了法院指令
Apparently, they had a court order.

211
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,330
不可能
That's impossible.

212
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,830
怎么可能這么快就申請到法院指令
How could they get a court order that fast?

213
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,010
我怎么知道  要不你去問問你女朋友
I don't know. Maybe you should ask your girlfriend.

214
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:54,890
女朋友
Girlfriend?

215
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,140
行了吧  我們確實一起睡了
Yes, okay. We slept together.

216
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,010
但那是很久以前了  有什么大不了的
It was a long time ago. What's the big deal?

217
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,860
沒什么  愛跟誰睡跟誰睡
There is no big deal. Sleep with whoever you want.

218
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,660
多多益善
The more the merrier.

219
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,860
我把毒物檢測報告拿來了
I have those, uh, toxicology reports you wanted.

220
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,730
好  放那兒吧  親愛的
Oh, yes. Just set 'em there, sweetie.

221
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,790
謝謝
Thank you.

222
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,660
你喜歡你的新實習吧
So enjoying your new internship?

223
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,150
我知道了很多新東西
Well, I'm learning a lot.

224
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,960
知道太多了
Too much I think.

225
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,080
我還以為最惡心的部分會是死尸呢
And I thought the dead bodies were going to be the grossest part.

226
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,440
有意思  晚安
Funny. Good night.

227
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,180
那么貝克特說的是誰
So who was Beckett talking about?

228
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,400
跟你無關  快去睡覺
None of your business. Now go to bed.

229
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,550
在碼頭出現的那個女的是誰
The woman at the docks, who is she?

230
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,630
不是誰
Nobody.

231
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,340
快去睡覺
Now go to bed.

232
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,860
我看到你看她的眼神了
I saw the way you looked at her.

233
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:33,870
她絕不是一般人
She's not nobody.

234
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,630
她是誰都無所謂
Well, it doesn't matter who she is

235
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,190
反正我們不會再見面了
because I am never going to see her again.

236
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,960
現在快去睡覺吧
Now go to bed.

237
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,110
要知道  你要是這么對我遮遮掩掩的
You know, if you're going to keep secrets from me,

238
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,040
我或許也會開始對你有所隱瞞
I might start keeping secrets from you, too.

239
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,630
你這年紀  瞞著爸爸點事也挺好的
At your age, I'm thinking, that might be a good idea.

240
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,390
索菲亞
Sophia.

241
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,250
晚上好  里克
Hello, Rick.

242
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,840
你怎么  做什么  你怎么進來的
How--what are you--how did-- how did you get in here?

243
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,150
我是中情局特工
I'm CIA.

244
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,720
你的小說現在還改編成漫畫了
So they're turning them into graphic novels now?

245
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,020
是的
Yeah. Um...

246
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,500
第一本反響不錯  他們還要改編一部
The first one did well, so they're gonna do another.

247
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,620
你覺得怎么樣  她看上去像我嗎
So what do you think, she look like me?

248
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,840
你到底來做什么
Uh... What are you doing here?

249
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,140
你們還在追查蓋奇不是嗎
You're going after Gage, aren't you?

250
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,840
沒有  我們不能跟這個案子了  記得嗎
No. We're off the case, remember?

251
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,010
還是過去的你更善于說謊
Mm. You used to be a better liar.

252
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,930
我知道你們在查布萊克利的化名
I know you've been looking into Blakely's aliases.

253
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,730
沒關系  里克  我不介意
It's okay, Rick. I don't mind.

254
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,230
事實上  我希望你繼續追查這個案子
In fact, I want you on this case.

255
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,100
-但  -我知道我說過什么
- But... -I know what I said,

256
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,140
但我也知道事關重大
but I also know what's at stake.

257
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,500
之前讓你和貝克特加入調查
Bringing you and Beckett on board

258
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,790
并不是一個很受歡迎的決定
was not a popular decision,

259
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:00,220
而且由于布萊克利的死  我得表明立場
And after what happened with Blakely, I had to make a stand.

260
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,630
但是我知道你的能力
But I know what kind of asset you can be.

261
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,920
我知道不管我說什么你都會繼續追查下去
I know you'll just keep digging no matter what I say.

262
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,180
這是你的天性
It's your nature.

263
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,720
你總得知道故事會有怎樣的結局
You need to know how the story ends.

264
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,840
就像她身上的故事一樣
Like with her.

265
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,410
她知道這些嗎
Does she know about this?

266
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,400
那是...
Well, that's...

267
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,620
你總是喜歡玩危險游戲
You always did like playing with dynamite.

268
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,510
只是小心別玩火自焚
Just be careful it doesn't blow up in your face.

269
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,330
她與眾不同
She's different.

270
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,390
是嗎
Is she?

271
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,490
還是只是你一廂情愿
Or do you just think she is?

272
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,830
聽說你們和我們一樣查布萊克利進了死胡同
I heard you hit the same dead end with Blakely as we did.

273
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,500
我想你們或許可以試一下這條線索
I thought you might be able to try this.

274
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,560
這就是布萊克利去碼頭要找的東西
It's what Blakely was looking for at the pier.

275
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,180
我們是在一個放著機票  現金和假身份證的
We found it in a go bag with plane tickets, cash,

276
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,750
沖鋒包里找到的
and some fake I.D.S.

277
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:56,790
銀行賬號
Account numbers?

278
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,090
全都是國內銀行的
All from domestic banks.

279
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,500
鑒于布萊克利是美國公民
And since Blakely was a U.S. Citizen--

280
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,790
你們沒有權力繼續調查他
You're prohibited from looking into them.

281
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,640
但是你們有
But you guys aren't.

282
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:06,080
這些帳號可能指向他的雇主的身份
And those accounts may contain clues as to who hired him.

283
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,930
我想你仍然好奇故事的結局吧
And assuming you still want to know how the story ends...

284
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,840
只是這一次務必及時向我通報消息
Just keep me in the loop this time.

285
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,960
還有  里克
And, Rick...

286
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,820
盡量保住自己的性命
Try not to get killed.

287
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,630
我還是挺喜歡你的
I'm still quite fond of you.

288
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,670
小伙子們都去哪兒了
Where are the boys?

289
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,880
他們在象棋公園做排查
They're canvassing chess parks,

290
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,740
看看有沒有人認識布萊克利
looking for anyone that knew Blakely.

291
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,780
你為什么沒有跟他們一起去
And why aren't you with them?

292
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,000
因為我的車正躺在哈德遜河河底
Because my car is at the bottom of the Hudson,

293
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,460
而且除非我上交事故報告
and Gates won't issue me another one

294
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,650
蓋茨就不肯給我配輛新車
until I write up an incident report,

295
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:56,430
可是這案子是機密所以我又不能寫報告
which I can't do because this case is classified.

296
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,030
你笑什么
What?

297
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,140
沒什么
Nothing.

298
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,530
只是  真是一個關鍵理論的絕佳例證
It's just, that's a perfect example of a linchpin.

299
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,750
這個案子可能永遠不能偵破就因為
This case might go unsolved all because

300
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,410
你拿不到一輛車
you don't have access to a car.

301
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,110
不要逼我開槍打你
Don't make me shoot you.

302
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,880
如果你真開槍打我
Well, if you shoot me,

303
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,480
誰來幫你追查這條線索
who's gonna help you follow this lead?

304
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,090
布萊克利的銀行賬戶信息
Blakely's bank account information.

305
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,550
這就是他去碼頭要找的東西
It's what he was going for on the pier.

306
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,450
如果我們能追蹤他的資產
If we can track his money--

307
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,850
你從哪里得到這個的
Where did you get that?

308
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:24,420
索菲亞
Sophia.

309
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,250
她昨晚去了我家
She came to my place last night.

310
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,870
-不是你想得那樣  -當然不是
- Not like that. - No, of course.

311
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,560
她不是說你"魯莽  幼稚
So then what happened to "Reckless, immature,

312
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,760
自我為中心"嗎
Self-centered jackass"?

313
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,310
她只是在同事面前表一下姿態
She was posturing for her colleagues.

314
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,670
貝克特  這是一條線索
Beckett, it's a lead.

315
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,980
她希望我們繼續追查此案
She wants us on the case.

316
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,600
你覺得到底發生了什么事
What do you think this is about, huh?

317
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,080
感覺像是情報部門的活動
It smells like an intelligence op.

318
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,240
中情局  國安局還是國土安全部
CIA, NSA, DHS?

319
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,060
就那幾個字母排列組合
Same letters, different alphabet.

320
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,130
我以前部隊里有些兄弟自愿參加情報部門行動
I had some buddies from the service volunteer for intelligence ops.

321
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,350
他們喜歡這份工作嗎
Yeah, how'd they like it?

322
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,670
他們都犧牲了
They all died.

323
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:59,170
你們認識這個人嗎
Hey, guys. Do you recognize this man?

324
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,110
我還真認識他
Matter of fact, I do.

325
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,020
他大概每周會來這公園兩三次
Uh, he comes to the park two or three times a week.

326
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,270
找人一起下棋
Looks for games.

327
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,800
你還知道些什么
What do you know about him?

328
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,730
他是一個瘋狂的棋手
He's a crazy chess player.

329
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,250
經常棋出怪招
Makes some weird moves,

330
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,450
比如犧牲皇后
like sacrificing his queen

331
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,230
只想看看會發生什么
just to see what happens.

332
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,380
但是他總是會贏
He always wins, though.

333
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,230
你知道他的名字嗎
Do you know his name?

334
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,740
叫斯科特什么的
Scott or something like that.

335
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,670
但是如果你們想多了解一下這個人
But I-if you want to know about this guy,

336
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,990
你們應該去找雅尼聊聊
you should talk to Jani.

337
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,810
雅尼是誰
Jani? Who's Jani?

338
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,050
另一個棋手
Another player.

339
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,760
他跟你們要找的這個人
Him and your guy...

340
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,690
最近經常聚在一起
been spending a lot of time together lately.

341
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,470
布萊克利的六個賬戶總計有兩百萬
So Blakely had over $2 million in six accounts,

342
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,770
但都是用假名開戶
and none of them under his real name.

343
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,030
往里面存款的都是非營利性組織  援助協會
Deposits were made by nonprofits, aid groups,

344
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,750
還有環保組織
environmental organizations.

345
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,870
如果這些真是他的秘密咨詢業務賬戶
So if those were his secret consulting accounts,

346
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,630
那么這些交易中極可能有一筆
it's possible that one of those payments

347
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,990
是用來支付潘多拉計劃的
was for operation Pandora.

348
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,600
沒錯  這兩筆
Exactly. These two.

349
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,830
每筆存入五十萬
Deposits of half a million dollars each.

350
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,190
這一筆是三個月前
This one was from three months ago,

351
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,020
這一筆是一個星期前
and this one was from a week ago.

352
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,200
是他開始和結束的報酬
His start and finish payments.

353
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,610
對  均來自海外賬戶
Mm-hmm. Both from offshore accounts.

354
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,850
但現在賬戶已關閉  是條死胡同
But they're closed. It's a dead end.

355
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,070
我們可能找到條有關布萊克利的線索
We may have a lead on Blakely.

356
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,300
公園里的人說他最近總和這人在一起
Guy in the park said he's been spending time with this man--

357
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,460
雅那切克·斯佰威
Janacek Spivey.

358
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,590
兩屆全國國際象棋冠軍  現在擔任
2-time national chess champion, now an economics professor

359
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,990
國際事務學校的經濟學教授
at the school of international affairs.

360
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,060
一個經濟學教授
An economics professor?

361
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,360
你覺得與這事有關
You think it's related?

362
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,240
我不知道這資料是否有用
Well, I don't know if this helps,

363
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,720
但他還是國際貨幣基金組織
but the guy is also an advisor to the I.M.F.,

364
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,680
聯合國經濟委員會以及
the U.N. Economics Council,

365
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,500
國會財政委員會的顧問
and the congressional finance committee.

366
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,040
對  就是他
Yeah, that's him.

367
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,180
但他說自己叫麥克格雷格  不是布萊克利
But he said his name was McGregor, not Blakely.

368
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,540
你對他了解多少
What do you know about him?

369
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,090
他是個非常厲害的棋手
Um, he was a hell of a chess player.

370
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:36,820
在我落子之前  他似乎總能洞察
Uh, it seemed like he knew every move I was gonna make

371
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,620
我要走的每一步
before I made it.

372
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,940
不  我是說...
No, I mean...

373
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,900
關于他個人
Personally.

374
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,630
其實他從沒聊過他個人的事
He never really talked about his personal life.

375
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:49,100
有目擊者稱你們常聊天  談了什么
Witnesses said you spent a lot of time talking. What about?

376
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,400
經濟學理論
Economic theory.

377
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,880
在知道我的職業之后
When he found out what I did,

378
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,450
他就問了我一大堆問題
he had a million questions.

379
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,760
什么樣的問題
What kind of questions?

380
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,330
有關世界的經濟力量
About world economic forces,

381
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,900
歷史上的社會經濟模型
historic socioeconomic models.

382
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,740
有時覺得他比我知道得還多
There were times it seemed like he knew more than I did.

383
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,610
他是個熱忱的發燒友
He was quite the hobbyist.

384
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:06,710
他可不只是個發燒友
Oh, he was more than just a hobbyist.

385
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,420
他有特別關注過什么東西嗎
Did he focus on anything in specific?

386
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,900
我沒什么印象
Uh, not that I remember.

387
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,140
但他對美國經濟非常關心
Though he was very concerned with the U.S.economy.

388
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,160
他從沒提過家人或朋友嗎
And he never mentioned any family or friends?

389
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,060
-沒有  -他去哪里買東西
- No. - Anywhere he might have shopped?

390
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,160
有任何能看出他住哪的線索嗎
Anything that might indicate where he lived?

391
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,080
沒有  但我覺得他住在聯合廣場
No. B- but I think he lived in Union Square.

392
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,380
為什么這么說
And what makes you say that?

393
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,940
有次我們散步結束
After one of our walks,

394
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,000
我發現把棋盤忘在公園了
uh, I discovered I'd left my chess set in the park.

395
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,970
往回走時  我看見他走向那里的一棟樓
And on my way back, I saw him head into a building there.

396
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,990
你能替我們指出是哪幢樓嗎
Do you think you can identify that building for us?

397
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,290
我想可以
I think so.

398
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,310
我得借下你的車
I gotta borrow your car.

399
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,790
對  他就住這里
Uh, yeah, this is his place right here.

400
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:49,670
但他叫芬利  不是布萊克利或是麥克格雷格
But he said his name was Finley, not Blakely or McGregor.

401
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,170
謝了
Thanks.

402
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,110
我們要找什么
What are we looking for?

403
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,860
報紙  電腦  電話記錄  賬單
Papers, computers, phone records, bills--

404
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,090
任何能幫我們想明白他在做什么的線索
anything that'll help us figure out what he was up to.

405
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,260
貝克特
Beckett.

406
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,490
我覺得我找到了
Think I found it.

407
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,740
搞什么啊
What the hell?

408
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,260

"U.S. commits troops to Taiwan."

413
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,940
美國遣軍駐中東
"U.S. commits troops to Middle East."

414
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,190
俄羅斯攻擊東歐
"Russia moves on Eastern Europe."

415
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,110
這個關鍵要制造出怎樣的后果啊
What kind of an outcome was this linchpin supposed to create?

416
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,090
終結我們所熟知的國家
The end of our country as we know it.

417
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,500
2017年8月  美國投降
預計2700萬傷亡

418
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,690
第三次世界大戰
A third world war.

419
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,100
不可能是真的
This can't be real.

420
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,300
沒人能預言這些
No one can predict all of this.

421
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,430
或許不會
Maybe not,

422
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:25,090
但有些比我們聰明的人相信他能做的
but a bunch of people smarter than us think he can

423
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,060
也會為了掩蓋這一切而殺人
and would kill to cover it up.

424
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:33,410
我發現了一個非常脆弱的環節
I found an alarming vulnerability...

425
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,820
看這邊
Over here.

426
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,940
這個環節將帶來
A linchpin that was tied to the economy

427
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,200
稅務騷亂

428
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,330
我們前所未見的
that would cause crisis and devastation

429
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,150
潘多拉

430
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,440
經濟危機和毀滅
beyond anything we'd ever seen.

431
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,860
關鍵

432
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:46,030
多米諾骨牌會永不停歇的倒下去
The dominos would just never stop falling.

433
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,470
她是誰
Who is she?

434
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,570
我不知道  但就是她了
I don't know, but this is it.

435
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,770
她就是那個關鍵
She's the linchpin.

436
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,710
是第一塊倒下的多米諾  將引發戰爭
The first domino to fall that... leads to war.

437
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,750
我把會給美國
I gave them the blueprint

438
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,670
帶來毀滅的藍圖交給了他們
that will bring out the end of our country as we know it.

439
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,890
"關鍵"殺手
已出現

440
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:05,570
我得給他們打電話  他們得知道這個
I have to call them. They have to know.

441
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,060
掛掉電話
Put the phone down.

442
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,730
-蓋奇  -快掛電話
- Gage? - Put the phone down now.

443
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,700
快跑
Now run.

444
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,060
-什么  -跑
- What? - Run!

445
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,470
我以為你是壞人
I thought you were the bad guy.

446
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,220
如果我是壞人  你們現在早死了
If I were the bad guy, you'd be dead by now.

447
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:34,820
這邊走
This way.

448
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,920
不  我的車就在外面
No, my car is out front.

449
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,930
他們盯著你的車  你出去就必死無疑
They're watching your car. You go that way, and you'll die.

450
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,390
外面的人是誰
Who's out there? Who are they?

451
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,340
知道答案和活著出去二選一
You can have answers or you can live.

452
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:42,820
你來選吧
Your choice.

453
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,050
趴下
Stay down!

454
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,590
我們得聯系中情局的聯絡人
We need to call our CIA contact.

455
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,450
我們得告訴他們發生了什么
We need to tell them what's going on.

456
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:58,740
不許打電話
No calls.

457
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,630
我們在哪里
Where are we?

458
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,900
安全的地方  但我們沒多少時間了
Someplace safe, but we don't have much time, all right?

459
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,150
我潛逃之前也聽到了風聲
I've been on the grid, I've heard the chatter.

460
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,200
不管到底是什么事  都將于明天發生
Whatever this is, it's going down tomorrow.

461
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,950
你們比我先到布萊克利家  目標是誰
Now you got to Blakely's before me. Who's the target?

462
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,970
你為什么殺了布萊克利和麥格拉
Why did you kill Blakely and McGrath?

463
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,220
我沒殺他們
I didn't.

464
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,310
你還想我再把槍從你手上奪走一次嗎
Come on. You really want me to take that gun away from you again?

465
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,780
-我們沒時間了  -擠點時間
- We don't have the time. - Make time.

466
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,980
做為一個特工
Look, as an asset,

467
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,850
你必須訓練出一些生存技能
you have to develop certain survival skills, all right?

468
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,030
最首要的能力
Chief of which is the ability

469
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,530
就是在原因不明時  發覺情況不對勁
to know something's wrong without knowing why.

470
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,170
通常是些小事情
It's always something small--

471
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,150
安全屋的電話有穩定的雜音
A static pop on your safe house phone,

472
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,820
刷卡時略微的延遲
a slight delay in authorization using your credit cards,

473
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,490
或是在和聯絡員談話時
or the almost imperceptible pauses

474
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,220
幾乎察覺不到的停頓
in conversations with your handler.

475
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,270
就知道情況不妙
Something's wrong,

476
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,750
如果你不查明是什么事
and if you don't figure out what,

477
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,560
你就活不過這周
you're not gonna survive the week.

478
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,760
現在  有人在一步步地把世界
Now someone is trying to send this world

479
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,930
引向戰爭
spiraling towards war,

480
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,260
他們想讓我做替罪羊
and they want me to take the fall,

481
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,180
但這兩件事他們都休想得逞
but neither of those things are gonna happen.

482
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,640
你得把目標的姓名告訴我
Now I need you to tell me what the name of the target is.

483
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,020
讓我先給我中情局的聯系人打電話
Look, let me call my CIA contact.

484
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,300
-她可以幫我們  -不行
- She can help us. - No.

485
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,680
一切跡象表明潘朵拉是由
Everything indicates that Pandora's being funded

486
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,700
與東歐有關聯的軍工部門資助的
by military industrial concerns linked with Eastern Europe.

487
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,740
他們無法完成這樣的行動
They can't pull off this operation,

488
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,800
必須有內應幫忙才有可能
all right, not without help from the inside.

489
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:36,300
探長  你還不懂嗎
Detective, don't you get it?

490
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:39,160
我的自己人在陷害我
My own people are setting me up.

491
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,110
除非我死了  不然他們不會罷手
And they're not gonna stop until I'm dead,

492
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,790
我是他們的調虎離山之計
because I'm the diversion.

493
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:46,060
如果每個人都在阻止我  卻沒人...
Okay, if everyone's trying to stop me, then no one--

494
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,810
沒人去阻止潘朵拉
Then no one's trying to stop Pandora.

495
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,460
除了我
No one but me.

496
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,420
我最后問你一次
Now I'm gonna ask you one last time,

497
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,120
目標是誰
Who's the target?

498
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,630
你好啊  托馬斯
Hello, Thomas.

499
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,990
這是最老的情報機關騙局了
It's the oldest intelligence con job in the book--

500
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:29,450
制造危機讓你們身處險境  他好來化險為夷
Create a crisis so you can ride in just in time to save the day.

501
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,420
蓋奇在耍你們
Gage was playing you.

502
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,040
他想讓你們覺得他是好人
He wanted you to think that he was the good guy.

503
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,140
他需要你們信任他
He needed your trust.

504
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,780
但是他為什么問我們"關鍵"是誰
Yeah, but then why did he ask us who the linchpin was?

505
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,430
他不是應該已經知道了嗎
Shouldn't he have known?

506
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,860
他在保護他的行動
He was protecting his op.

507
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,430
想要查明我們知情程度  然后再殺你們
He was ascertaining how much we knew before he killed you.

508
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,380
如果你說的對  而襲擊只是一出戲
Well, if you're right and the attack on us was staged,

509
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,710
那他不可能是單獨行動
then he can't be working alone.

510
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:44,810
蓋奇肯定有一個同伙
Gage must have a partner.

511
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,120
就是說這事還沒完
Which means it's not over.

512
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,250
消防人員沒控制住布萊克利公寓的火勢
Fire crews were unable to contain the blaze in Blakely's apartment.

513
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,860
他的研究都沒了
All of his research is gone.

514
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:54,040
在所有面部識別數據庫里搜索這個
I want you to run this through every facial rec database we have.

515
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,080
我要知道她是誰
I want to know who she is

516
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,720
而且一個十歲的女孩
and I want to know how the hell a 10-year-old girl

517
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,070
怎么會是引發戰爭的第一塊多米諾骨牌
could be the first domino in the march toward war.

518
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:00,600
蓋奇在哪里
Where's Gage?

519
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,680
在禁閉室
In the tank.

520
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,410
那個被你扔出窗外的人加里·哈勃
You know that guy you threw out the window-- Gary Harper?

521
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:13,670
他是我朋友
He was a friend.

522
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,700
那你就不該派他來找我
Then you shouldn't have sent him for me.

523
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:20,290
我們以前見過
You know, we've met before.

524
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,220
在柏林
In Berlin,

525
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,030
曼海姆那件事
the Mannheim business.

526
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,420
交貨的時候你也跟西班牙人在一起
You were there at the drop-off with the Spaniard.

527
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,610
你很棒
You were good.

528
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,820
你現在在為誰賣命
So who are you working for now?

529
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,690
那個小女孩是誰
Who's the girl?

530
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,250
"關鍵"是誰
Who's the linchpin?

531
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,540
誰讓我坐了冷板凳
Who put me in the cold?

532
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,960
誰陷害了我
Who set me up?

533
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,640
那么你認為中情局內有內應
So you think there's someone inside the CIA--

534
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,210
有個內鬼  叛徒
a mole, a traitor?

535
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,340
你是這么想得嗎
Is that what you think?

536
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,870
我想你或許是對的
You know, I think you could be right.

537
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:57,250
那個人就是你
And I think it's you.

538
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,670
你在犯下錯誤
You're making a mistake.

539
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,950
不  你和你的同伙在犯錯
No, you and your partner are making a mistake.

540
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,780
我沒有同伙
I don't have a partner.

541
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,750
那個殺了麥格拉和布萊克利的人
The guy out there, the one that killed McGrath and Blakely

542
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,680
那個把你的朋友撞進河里
and drove your friends into the water,

543
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,570
正在執行潘朵拉的那個人
the one carrying out operation Pandora,

544
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,000
他和我不是一伙人
He's not with me.

545
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:14,950
我在港口看到他了  看他的身手
I saw him at the docks, the way he moved.

546
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:15,970
他是你們的人
He's with you.

547
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,010
他是中情局特工
He's CIA.

548
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,270
你確定他在說謊嗎
Are you sure he's lying?

549
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,330
他沒有顯露出任何撒謊的身體特征
He's not expressing any of the physiological traits.

550
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,190
他接受過說謊訓練  不會露出馬腳
He's trained to lie without betraying himself.

551
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:43,880
他想挑撥我們之間的關系  讓我們互相懷疑
He wants to divide us, make us suspicious of each other.

552
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,020
相信我  叛徒絕對是他
Trust me. There's no mole but him.

553
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,270
萬一你判斷錯了  他說得是事實呢
What if you're wrong? What if he's telling the truth?

554
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,090
這無關緊要
That is immaterial.

555
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,500
現在  外面還有人
Right now, there is someone else out there,

556
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,270
正在準備實行潘朵拉
who is preparing to go through with Pandora,

557
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:54,060
那個小女孩是關鍵
and that girl is the key.

558
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,580
我們要找到她
We need to find her.

559
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,000
所有的數據庫都查不到
Still negative on all databases.

560
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,200
她是外籍人士  可能不在我們的數據庫里
She's a foreign national. She might not be in any of ours.

561
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,130
她的校服呢
What about her school uniform?

562
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,360
可以通過那個找到她嗎
Can you identify her through that?

563
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,470
試過了  露出的校徽太少  無法辨認
We tried. There's not enough of the crest visible to identify it.

564
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,390
你們真的相信嗎  謀殺一個小女孩
Do you really buy this, that killing a little girl

565
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:14,260
會導致美國的瓦解
could lead to the collapse of the United States?

566
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,770
太荒謬了
I mean, it just seems crazy.

567
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:18,050
布萊克利的第一個關鍵理論也很荒謬
Yeah, well, so did Blakely's first linchpin.

568
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,910
他們要求他制定一個非核軍事戰略
They asked him to develop a nonnuclear military strategy

569
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,720
能夠瓦解蘇聯
that would bring down the Soviet Union.

570
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,930
結果發現  我們只需開支超過他們即可
Turns out, all we had to do was outspend them.

571
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,880
得再審訊一下蓋奇
Need to take another run at Gage.

572
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,420
看來他是我們目前唯一線索了
Looks like he's all we've got.

573
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,770
封鎖這里
Put us on lockdown.

574
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,760
禁止任何人進出
No one leaves or enters the facility.

575
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,330
接觸燒傷  他是被近距離射殺的
Contact burns. He was shot point-blank.

576
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:55,550
怎么會沒有人聽到槍聲
How is it that nobody heard the shot?

577
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,200
這間房子是隔聲的
The room is soundproof.

578
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,590
關鍵問題在于
The real question is...

579
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,240
怎么會沒人看到
how come nobody saw?

580
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,030
有人黑了視頻流
Someone hacked the video stream.

581
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:05,030
怎么可能  你們可是中情局
How is that possible? You're the CIA.

582
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,790
你們的電腦是全世界最安全的
You have the most secure computers in the world.

583
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,180
蓋奇有可能沒說謊
It's possible because Gage was right.

584
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,610
局里有叛徒
There's a mole in the CIA,

585
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:10,930
那個人就是這個團隊中的一員
and he's in this unit.

586
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:11,880
封鎖完畢
Facility's locked down.

587
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,690
所有人員都在崗
All personnel have been accounted for.

588
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:15,270
有多少人有權限進入那個房間
How many people had access to that room?

589
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:15,870
18個
18.

590
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,750
長官  我已經隔離了篡改視頻的子程序
Ma'am, I've isolated the subroutine used to doctor the video.

591
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:21,380
它嵌在一個蠕蟲病毒里才沒被發現
It was embedded in a software worm to escape detection.

592
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,110
就是說查不出它的來源
Then there's no way to tell where it came from.

593
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,960
我或許可以使用還原算法
I may be able to use a reductive logarithm

594
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,180
以分離出它進入系統的路徑
to isolate the pathway it took through the system.

595
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,510
這樣也許就能知道來源了
It might tell us where it was loaded.

596
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,710
-你能做到嗎  -我試試
- You can do that? - I can try.

597
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:31,740
開始吧
Do it.

598
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:35,890
我完全不懂他們在說什么
Wow. I got no idea what they're talking about,

599
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,440
可這好令人好激動啊
But this is very exciting.

600
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,270
好了  開始追蹤
There it is. Starting the trace.

601
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,700
找到了
Got it.

602
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,100
這就是上傳病毒的終端地址
That's the terminal address where the virus was uploaded.

603
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,170
是誰的
Whose is it?

604
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,590
杜蘭特工
Agent Trahn's.

605
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,010
什么  不是我
What? No.

606
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,640
-你們弄錯了  -把手放在顯眼位置
- There's been a mistake. - Get your hands where I can see them.

607
00:27:58,730 --> 00:27:59,750
趴在地上  現在  快點  趴下
Get down on the ground now! Do it now! Down now!

608
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,850
等一下  那是個誘餌
Wait! It's a decoy.

609
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:03,290
黑客盜用了那個IP  不是杜蘭
The hacker piggybacked the I.P. It's not trahn.

610
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,130
那到底是誰
Then who is it?

611
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:06,140
上傳病毒的那人用了杜蘭的終端IP
Whoever uploaded it used Trahn's terminal I.P.

612
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,310
隱藏了自己的身份
to hide their I.D.

613
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,650
他很強  但我更勝一籌
They're good, but I'm better.

614
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,100
我提取出了用戶的帳號密碼
I've isolated the user's pass code.

615
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,580
我正在解碼
I'm de-encrypting now.

616
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,010
IP地址識別

617
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,170
開始進行人員比對
Run a personnel match.

618
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,800
馬丁 丹博格

619
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,370
馬丁
Martin?

620
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:30,630
不是我  索菲
No, Soph.

621
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:31,970
我是忠誠的  你是知道的
I'm loyal. You know I'm loyal.

622
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:33,260
那把槍放下
Then put the gun down.

623
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,560
把槍放下
Put it down!

624
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,100
好的
Okay.

625
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,670
好吧
All right. Okay.

626
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,370
馬丁  只要你開槍她就死  所有人后退
Martin! No! You shoot, she dies. Everyone, back up now.

627
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:46,220
-馬丁  別這樣  -大家后退
- Martin, don't. Don't do it. - Back up now! Back--back up now!

628
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,270
按那個
Hit it.

629
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,770
馬丁  停下
Martin, don't.

630
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,920
馬丁  別這樣  馬丁
Martin, don't! Martin.

631
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,620
馬丁  把槍放下
Put the gun down, martin.

632
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,460
謝了  但我更想保命
Thanks, but I'd rather live.

633
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,140
把電梯停下
Shut the elevator down.

634
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,140
連上了
I'm in.

635
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,710
各就各位  我把電梯降回來
Standby. I'm bringing it back down.

636
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,060
你是不可能發現的
There's no way you could've known.

637
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,250
不可能嗎  當我們剛得知"潘朵拉"
No? When we first got wind of Pandora,

638
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,650
丹博格是首先找到所有關聯的人
Danberg was the one who found all the connections.

639
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,120
是他追蹤到蓋奇的
He was the one who traced it to Gage,

640
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,250
只為不讓我們過于接近他
all so we wouldn't get too close to him.

641
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,940
他甚至勸我踢走你們二位
He even tried to convince me to get rid of you two.

642
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,030
最糟糕的是
And worst of all,

643
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,410
他可能不是單獨行動
he may not be working alone.

644
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,500
潘朵拉的影響很大
The implications of Pandora are huge.

645
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,500
我不懂為什么我們自己人會
I don't understand how one of our own would actually

646
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,970
希望把我們國家甚至世界攪入戰爭
want to plunge the country or the world into war.

647
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:02,580
金錢  理想  都說不通
Money, ideology-- none of it makes any sense.

648
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,720
動機不重要
Well, the motives don't matter.

649
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,380
重要的是阻止潘朵拉
All that matters is stopping Pandora.

650
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,700
蓋奇說他聽到些風聲
Gage said he picked up chatter.

651
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,530
他說行動明天執行
He said it's going down tomorrow.

652
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:08,400
跟我們聽到的一致
We've heard the same thing,

653
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,450
就是說我們的時間所剩無幾
which means, we don't have any time.

654
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,040
必須要找到小女孩
We have to find her.

655
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,570
我們一定遺漏了什么
Well, there's gotta be something that we missed,

656
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:16,090
某些能夠幫助我們找到她的細節
some detail that'll help us figure out who she is.

657
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:17,970
我們已經在所有數據庫里搜索了
We've run it through every database we have.

658
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:19,710
我們查了能查的一切
We have looked through everything.

659
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,990
不是一切
Not everything.

660
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,960
你們監控全球地形  對吧
You guys maintain a topographical survey of the earth, right?

661
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,820
是的  怎么
Yeah. Why?

662
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:28,620
不要搜索女孩
So don't search for the girl.

663
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,190
搜索這些山脈
Run the mountains.

664
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:33,040
如果知道她來自哪兒  就可以縮小搜索范圍了
If we know where she's from, we can narrow down our search.

665
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,190
你真天才
You are a genius.

666
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,250
這要花多長時間
How long will this take?

667
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:48,350
地球很大
It's a big world.

668
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,600
我們調出了所有的位于
We've pulled anything arid

669
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,740
北緯60度到南緯60度之間的干旱地帶
and everything above and below 60 degrees latitude,

670
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:54,300
但他們還在估算  也許要32個小時
But they're estimating, it could take 32 hours.

671
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,410
會是個漫漫長夜啊
Sounds like a long night.

672
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:56,840
我去倒些咖啡
I'll get some coffees.

673
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:02,470
他總是很體貼
He was always thoughtful.

674
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,840
你喜歡他
You like him.

675
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,870
是的  曾經
I did. Once.

676
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:14,980
你們之間發生了什么
S-so what happened?

677
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,510
如果你不介意的話
If you don't mind my asking.

678
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,130
是這樣的
Well, um,

679
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,040
你有過
Well, you ever...

680
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:25,000
認識一個人  然后有了一種...
meet someone and--and have that...

681
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:28,850
強烈的吸引力的經歷嗎
intense attraction right away...

682
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,880
那種張力
You know, that tension?

683
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,470
我們抗拒了幾個月  后來
Well, we fought it for months, and then...

684
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,720
后來我們再也不能忍受了
And then we just couldn't stand it anymore.

685
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,060
但之后  感覺
But afterward, it--it was like

686
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,570
那種張力是我們
that tension was all we...

687
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,070
僅有的
had really in.

688
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:49,330
除此之外  我們之間剩下的只有
And without it, all we were left with was that...

689
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,270
把彼此逼瘋的那些瑣事
Well, those things that drove us crazy about each other.

690
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,490
你知道他那個人
I mean, you know how he can be.

691
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,170
對
Yeah.

692
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,760
我知道
Yeah, I do.

693
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:04,210
有時我真希望我沒跟他上床
Sometimes I wish we had never slept together...

694
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,180
應該一直那樣曖昧著
Had kept that longing.

695
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:17,670
連咖啡杯上都印著"中情局"  太酷了
Even your coffee mugs say "CIA." That is so cool.

696
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,040
如果我們能成功拯救世界
Well, we save the world,

697
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,560
也許我會給你一個
maybe I'll let you keep one.

698
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:21,970
有動力了
Incentive.

699
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:56,570
照片里的地貌與
Uh, the topography matches terrain

700
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:58,430
中國浙江省的地理形勢吻合
in the Chinese province of Zhejiang,

701
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:00,080
就在杭州城外
just outside the city of Hangzhou.

702
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,050
靠近上海
That's near Shanghai.

703
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:03,820
找出區域內所有學校的校服徽章
Pull up all school uniform insignias from that region.

704
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:08,280
等等  右上角那
Wait. Right there on the top right corner.

705
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,570
它們顏色相同
They're the same color.

706
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,450
上海第12女子中學
Shanghai No.12 Girls' School.

707
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:12,520
學校有網址嗎
Do they have a web site?

708
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,240
有  但有密碼保護  開始解鎖
It's password protected. Picking the lock now.

709
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:18,150
黑進學校的照片檔案  進行面部識別
Hack into their photo archives and run facial rec.

710
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:22,550
連帶注解進行對照
Bring up the captions and compare.

711
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,330
掃描照片

712
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:23,900
97%吻合

713
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,850
找到了  米婭·岡宏
Got her. Mia Ganghong.

714
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:26,140
有關于她的資料嗎
What do we know about her?

715
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,250
不是很多
Uh, not much.

716
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:30,620
僅知道她是祥和碧玉·岡宏的女兒
Just that she's the daughter of Xiang and Biyu Ganghong.

717
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:31,940
祥·岡宏
Xiang Ganghong?

718
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,010
誰是祥·岡宏
Who's Xiang Ganghong?

719
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,220
一個中國商人
He's a Chinese businessman.

720
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,720
同財政部長和
With close ties to the Finance Minister

721
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,280
執政黨關系密切
and members of the ruling party.

722
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,470
為何他女兒會成為目標
Well, why is his daughter targeted?

723
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,840
祥是有權支配要職任命
Xiang is a kingmaker.

724
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,360
他對政府經濟政策的制定
He's extremely influential

725
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:45,490
有充分的影響力
in shaping his government's economic policy.

726
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:48,550
他通過出售中國軍事硬件致富
He made his fortune selling Chinese military hardware.

727
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,640
有時會賣給我們的敵人
Sometimes to our enemies.

728
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,130
但基于他支持中國購買美國國債的原因
But we left him alone because he was supportive

729
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,360
我們聽之任之
of China's purchase of U.S. Debt.

730
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,440
現在如果有人想除掉祥
Now if someone were to take out Xiang,

731
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,330
對我們也沒多大影響
not that much would change.

732
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,970
但如果他的女兒在一場拙劣的
But if his daughter were killed

733
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,680
暗殺中被殺的話
in a botched assassination attempt,

734
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,890
中國會追查到
and the Chinese were able to trace it

735
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:05,530
美國政府
back to the U.S. Government?

736
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,580
進而追查到蓋奇
The trail that led to Gage.

737
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,030
不難想象祥會利用
It's conceivable that Xiang could use

738
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,300
其充分的影響力
his considerable influence

739
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,780
只手讓中國停止購買美國國債
to single handedly end China's purchase of the U.S. Debt.

740
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,400
國家繼續赤字開支
This country runs on deficit spending.

741
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,020
如果國家借不到錢
If--if we can't borrow money--

742
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,440
就不能履行國家義務
We couldn't meet our obligations,

743
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,540
政府就會倒閉
the government would shut down.

744
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,990
財政緊縮會被強制執行
Austerity measures would be imposed.

745
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:22,870
我們將喪失在全球部署軍事的能力
We'd lose our ability to deploy our military around the world.

746
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:24,370
隨之美國宣布中立
And then with the U.S. neutralized,

747
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,550
我們的敵人就會
our enemies would be able

748
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,640
瘋狂掠奪獲取利益
to explore their interests unchecked.

749
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,330
就是這樣
That's right.

750
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:30,180
還會爆發地區沖突
And there would be an explosion of regional conflicts,

751
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:32,620
其中的任何一個都能引發全球戰爭
any one of which could send us toward global war.

752
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,220
一場我們甚至沒能力打贏的戰爭
A war that we might not even be able to win.

753
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,680
一塊多米諾骨牌被撞倒  整個世界將會翻天覆地
One domino knocked down, the entire world changes.

754
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,540
我們找到祥了  
We've located Xiang.

755
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,990
一小時前他和中國代表團
He and a chinese delegation

756
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,850
剛剛抵達肯尼迪國際機場
just landed at J.F.K. an hour ago.

757
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:41,680
他來紐約了
He's here?

758
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,690
參加麥金利大廈舉行的聯合國貿易會議
For a U.N. Trade Conference at the Mckinley Building.

759
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:44,660
他們在過來的路上
They're on their way there now.

760
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:47,050
長官  他女兒跟他在一起
And, ma'am, his daughter's with him.

761
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:57,840
如果現在召集
If we call it in,

762
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,820
我能找到安保小分隊待命
I can get a protective detail waiting.

763
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,580
你覺得警察能夠阻攔
You think your cops are gonna be able to stop

764
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,150
中情局訓練有素的特工嗎
CIA-trained operatives?

765
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,340
他們會送命的
They'd just end up dead.

766
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,510
另外  如泄露半點風聲
Besides, if word of this gets out,

767
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:08,600
將會引發空前絕后的國際爭端
it could spark an international incident of epic proportions.

768
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,590
我們得收拾殘局  而不是制造事端
We need to clean up the mess, not make one.

769
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,810
就我們嗎
We and what army?

770
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,100
你說過我們不能相信別人
You said we couldn't trust the others

771
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,630
因為他們可能同丹博格是一伙的
because they could be working with Danberg.

772
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,530
此處不是中情局在紐約的唯一駐點
This is not the only CIA Station in New York.

773
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:17,810
我已經叫另外一隊人趕去現場
I've got another field team on its way.

774
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:19,460
封鎖這里  等我消息
You seal it up until you hear from me.

775
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,010
禁止電話進出
No calls going in or out.

776
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,020
我不能冒險
I'm not taking any chances.

777
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,010
遵命  長官
Yes, ma'am.

778
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,690
科里根特工  這是貝克特探長和卡塞爾先生
Agent Corrigan, Detective Beckett and Mr. Castle.

779
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,600
代表團人呢
Where's the delegation?

780
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,700
五分鐘路程
Five minutes away.

781
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,610
我們的人就位了嗎
We in position?

782
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:41,070
走廊上部署了人  街對面也有人監視
We have teams in the lobby and spotters across the street.

783
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,240
丹博格呢
What about Danberg?

784
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,910
一名守衛認出他45分鐘前
A guard I.D.'ed him as having entered the building

785
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,090
進入大廈
45 minutes ago.

786
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:47,110
已有專人就位  得到授權"見即殺"
We have crews in place authorized to take him out,

787
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,890
但還沒找到他拍檔
but we still haven't identified his partner.

788
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:50,910
無論發生何事  確保小女孩的安全
Whatever happens, keep the girl alive.

789
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:51,860
明白嗎
Do you understand me?

790
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,910
是的  長官
Yes, ma'am.

791
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,570
我們要去哪
Where are we going?

792
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:57,410
這邊
This way.

793
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:10,530
咱們跑這來干嗎
What are we doing down here?

794
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,270
咱們不是應該去大堂嗎
Shouldn't we be headed for the lobby?

795
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,450
卡塞爾
Castle.

796
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:17,210
抱歉
Sorry.

797
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:25,410
你這是干嗎
What are you doing?

798
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,560
丹博格根本就不是叛徒  對吧
Danberg wasn't the mole, was he?

799
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,070
你才是
You are.

800
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,390
去殺了那個女孩  這兩個人交給我
Go kill the girl. I'll take care of these two.

801
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,990
一直都是你嗎
It was you this whole time?

802
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:41,380
恐怕是的
I'm afraid so.

803
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,680
那你又何必把我們帶來這里呢
Then why bring us here?

804
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,710
何不直接把我們留在那邊
Why not just leave us at the facility?

805
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:59,980
因為你從不肯善罷甘休
Because you just don't stop.

806
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:02,660
你非得了解整件事不可
You need to know the story, the whole story.

807
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:05,380
如果有些細節對不上  你就窮追不舍
And if something doesn't add up, you just don't let go.

808
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,320
你以為我帶你們來干什么
Why do you think I brought you inside?

809
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,700
我是在保護這次行動
I was protecting the op.

810
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,470
就像你為了保護行動
Like you were trying to protect the operation

811
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,570
殺了布萊克利和麥格拉
when you killed Blakely and McGrath?

812
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,130
你陷害了蓋奇
You set up Gage.

813
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,330
要使我們的計劃成功
Well, for the linchpin to work,

814
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:17,500
必須讓中國人怪罪美國政府
the Chinese have to blame the U.S. government.

815
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,350
整個行動必須讓人追蹤到中情局頭上來
The operation has to trace back to the CIA.

816
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:22,260
當你需要防止自己暴露時  你就把他給殺了
And when you needed to cover your tracks, you killed him.

817
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,680
所以現在需要其他替罪羊
So then you needed someone else.

818
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,050
你需要丹博格
You needed Danberg.

819
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,500
索菲亞
Sophia...

820
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,280
第三次世界大戰  為什么
World War III, why?

821
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,430
這么說吧  這世界上有些黨派
Let's just say, there are certain parties

822
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:35,330
會不惜一切代價來重組這個世界
who will pay anything to reshape the world.

823
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,320
我不信
I don't buy it.

824
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,890
我認識的那個索菲亞決不會為了錢
The Sophia I know wouldn't sell out her country,

825
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:50,550
或是其它任何原因當叛國賊
not for money, not for anything.

826
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,900
那就你就錯了  里奇
Well, that's one thing you got wrong, Rick.

827
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,640
這根本就不是我的國家

828
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,680
給我跪下
On your knees right now.

829
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,910
你們倆都跪下
Both of you.

830
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,290
你不可能從這件事中全身而退
You're never gonna get away with this.

831
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:12,750
我當然可以
Of course I will.

832
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:15,800
我就告訴他們我們盡了全力  卻還是晚了一步
I'll just tell them how we all tried to stop it and couldn't,

833
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:17,560
而你們倆則在我們執行任務的過程中遇害了
and the two of you were killed in the process,

834
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,180
兇手當然就是丹博格
by Danberg, of course.

835
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:22,160
別擔心  我會把你倆塑造成英雄的
Don't worry. I'll make it sound heroic.

836
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,880
你父親會為你感到自豪的
Your father will be very proud.

837
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,410
我父親
My father?

838
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,310
拜托  你不會以為你當初能來中情局
Well, you don't think you gained special access

839
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,730
是因為你的魅力吧
to the CIA back then because of your charm.

840
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,420
你還真是不知情啊
You really don't know, do you?

841
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,730
看來你永遠都不會知道了
I guess you never will.

842
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:45,900
不
No!

843
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,950
快走
Come on.

844
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,960
只有咱們三個  時間不多了
It's just us, and we're out of time.

845
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:53,520
你沒事吧
Are you okay?

846
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,830
他沒事
He's fine.

847
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:56,070
他沒事  他沒事
He's good. He's okay.

848
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,380
先生  你沒事吧  你沒事吧
Sir, are you all right? You all right?

849
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,100
-這邊  -沒錯  也許咱們該出去透透氣
- This way.  - Yeah, maybe we should go outside.

850
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,230
你覺得這一切到底是怎么回事
So what do you think this was all about?

851
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,790
他們沒告訴你嗎
They didn't tell you?

852
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:19,320
什么
What? Th --

853
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:22,660
他們告訴你了
They -- they told you?

854
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:23,820
她反咬我一口
Once she turned me out,

855
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,430
我也就很快明白了事情的真相
it didn't take long to put the pieces together.

856
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:28,140
但是我當時只能旁觀
But all I could do was watch

857
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,940
等著她下一步行動
and wait for her to make her move.

858
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,640
很難相信她居然是個叛徒
Hard to believe she was a traitor.

859
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,890
一切都是裝出來的
It was all an act.

860
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:36,160
蘭利[中情局總部]認為她有可能是前克格勃成員
Langley thinks she may have been a former K.G.B. sleeper

861
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,460
隨著蘇維埃的解散  她也就開始了漂泊
set adrift when the Soviet Union broke up.

862
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:41,270
她留在局里是因為她無處可去
Stayed with the company because she had nowhere else to go.

863
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:42,800
直到更好的機會出現
Till a better offer came along.

864
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,880
你們查出來她替誰工作
Did you ever find out who she was working for,

865
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,110
誰才是潘朵拉的幕后黑手了嗎
who was behind Pandora?

866
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,420
沒有  就算我查出來了也不能告訴你
No, and even if I did, I couldn't tell you.

867
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,850
丹博格探員
Agent Danberg...

868
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,810
索菲亞跟我說了一些事情
Sophia said something,

869
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:58,970
她說我父親在中情局工作
Something about my father being in the CIA.

870
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:01,140
你對此會不會也有所耳聞呢
Would you know anything about that?

871
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,930
我恐怕不知道
I'm afraid I don't.

872
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:04,170
抱歉
Sorry.

873
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,570
貝克特探長
Oh, uh, Detective Beckett.

874
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,780
給你
Here.

875
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,590
我讓我的人處理了一下你的車
I had our guys, uh, take care of your car.

876
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,170
你把我的車從河里撈出來了
You pulled my car out of the river?

877
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:15,430
是啊  你會發現車比新的還贊
Yep. I think you will find it better than new.

878
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:16,700
謝謝
Thank you.

879
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,790
這是我們該做的
It's the least that we could do.

880
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,650
保重
Take care.

881
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,770
你覺得她說的關于我父親的事
You think she was telling the truth

882
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:35,710
是真話嗎
about my father?

883
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:37,940
如果是的話倒是可以解釋
I mean, that would explain

884
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,660
他為什么突然間就人間蒸發了
why he completely disappeared.

885
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,300
我
I...

886
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:45,140
我認為索菲亞說了很多謊話
I think that Sophia told a lot of lies.

887
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,320
你肯定覺得不好受吧
Must be tough,

888
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,640
發現她是個叛國賊
finding out that she's a traitor,

889
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,220
尤其是你以她為原型創作了克萊拉·斯瑞克
especially after you based Clara Strike on her and all.

890
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,770
怎么說呢
Hmm. Well...

891
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:02,780
克萊拉最開始是以索菲亞為原型  但
Clara started off as Sophia, but...

892
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,780
她后來變得更像你
she ended up being more like you, you know --

893
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,940
聰明  勇猛  善良
smart, fierce, kind.

894
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,640
這也是我被你吸引的原因
I think that's one of the reasons I was drawn to you

895
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,270
像繆斯一樣吸引
as a muse.

896
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,110
你覺得布萊克利博士
You think Dr. Blakely was right...

897
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:18,010
對關鍵理論的判斷是對的嗎
about the linchpin?

898
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:20,940
你覺得咱們真的拯救了世界嗎
Do you think we actually saved the world?

899
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,190
我認為我們救了一個小女孩的命
I think that we saved a little girl's life,

900
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:25,620
這對我來說就足夠了
and that's enough for me.
