1
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,100
Don't get up yet. Stay in bed.

2
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,380
Castle.

3
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,390
Kate. Hi.

4
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,380
Castle. What? Did you do this?

5
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,390
What?

6
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,400
Stop saying "what" and wake up. I don't...

7
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,770
We're handcuffed. Kinky.

8
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:52,790
Castle, it's not funny.

9
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,450
I didn't say "funny. " I said "kinky." And I didn't cuff us.

10
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,800
Well, y-you think I cuffed us? Well, they look like police cuffs.

11
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,090
Somebody else did this to us.

12
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,490
Do you recognize this place? No.

13
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,280
But if I were writing a book,

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,090
this is where bad things would happen. My watch is missing.

15
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,640
Mine, too, and my wallet. So is my badge and my gun.

16
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,090
And my phone. I just renewed my contract.
Would you stop joking?

17
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,050
Hey, do I begrudge you your coping mechanisms?

18
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,390
What's the last thing that you remember?
I...

19
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:34,160
It's kind of a blur.
Yeah, me, too.

20
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,870
I think we were drugged.
Yeah, I think so, too, and not the good kind.

21
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:41,030
Okay. Lift my top.

22
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,580
I think you might still be under the influence, but okay.

23
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,990
Castle, not like that. Just check my back. There's something that hurts.

24
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,770
There's a needle mark. We were drugged.

25
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,900
It looks like the work of a pygmy with a blowgun.

26
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,110
Okay, you can put my shirt down.

27
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,810
- Yeah, sorry. - Thanks.

28
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,400
All right, Castle, I want you to think very hard.

29
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,830
What's the last thing that you remember from this morning?
I was with you.

30
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:09,070
We were, uh, someplace seedy-- a hotel that rents rooms by the hour.

31
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,620
Would you just knock it off?
It's where we were.

32
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,250
You called me and you asked me to meet you there.

33
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,400
Oh, I did. Yes.

34
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,000
And then I took you up to the room and then we...

35
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,060
And then we...

36
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,350
Dead body. We went to go and see a dead body.

37
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,650
Right. A dead body.

38
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,300
You know what I love about working with you?

39
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,350
You always take me to the most charming places.

40
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,710
Well, I'm a simple girl, Castle. I go where the bodies are.

41
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:44,140
Besides, for a mystery novelist, aren't seedy motels kind of a standard?

42
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,570
Ah, yes. Matter of fact,

43
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,680
they're a veritable advent calendar of salaciousness.

44
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,680
Behind every door, a delightful tale of desperation, depravity--

45
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,960
Or death.

46
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,120
You know, you need to stop being a control freak.
I'm not--what do you mean, a control freak?

47
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,950
- You are being a control freak. - I've never been a control freak.

48
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,220
Sorry. Are we interrupting?

49
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,660
No. Victim's a white male, late 30s.

50
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,930
Housekeeping found him when they came to clean the room.
Cause of death?

51
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,160
Not entirely sure yet.

52
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,960
But there are indications of asphyxia with some cyanosis around the face.

53
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,250
So he was suffocated?

54
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,690
Maybe. Then again, there's this.
Needle mark.

55
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,350
So he could've just OD'd, passed out face first,

56
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,360
- and suffocated. - Oh, no. It's definitely murder.

57
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,790
How can you tell?
Someone torched his fingers.

58
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,130
Burned off his prints.

59
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,850
They wanted to erase his identity.
And they did a pretty good job, too.

60
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,160
His wallet's missing,
and we've been through the room a couple of times.

61
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,300
There's nothing here to tell us who this guy is.
Did he pay for the room in cash?

62
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,430
Yeah, and the clerk said that he registered as Jack Sparrow.

63
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,510
Oh, there's a possibility that's his real name.

64
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,670
Sure it is.

65
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,760
We're running it just in case.

66
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,690
The clerk also said he appeared nervous when he checked in.

67
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,460
He, uh, kept looking behind him.

68
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,400
- Did he have any visitors? - He couldn't say,

69
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,520
but this isn't the most secure building. I saw a camera in the lobby.

70
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,070
- It's a dummy. - It's not the only one.

71
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:04,030
It's used to scare away drug dealers.

72
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,120
Okay, um...

73
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,700
you don't go to the trouble of trying to erase someone's identity

74
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,310
unless you have a very good reason to.

75
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,030
Lanie, what are the chances of us recovering some of the prints?

76
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,840
Depends on how bad the burns are. L-let me get him back to the morgue.

77
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,730
Okay, in the meantime, let's get Ryan to run his photos through missing persons

78
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,590
and... see if anything pops.

79
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,710
You got it.

80
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,880
John Doe in a seedy motel
with his fingerprints burned off.

81
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,690
How did we get from there - to here? - Whoa.

82
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,240
Whoa, easy, easy there.

83
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,370
Hate to state the obvious,
but we're kind of joined at the hip here.

84
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,190
Okay, let's just get up. Come on.

85
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,440
Are you always like this in the morning?

86
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,900
Oh, this is...

87
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,270
- this is awkward. - Yeah.

88
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,550
They couldn't just handcuff us "Midnight Run" style?

89
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,340
Wait a minute. Ryan did run our guy through missing persons,

90
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,770
and there wasn't a match. Then what?
Then...

91
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,700
Ryan asked me...

92
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,140
if he spent Thanksgiving at his family's house,

93
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,120
did that mean he had to spend Christmas
at Jenny's family's house?

94
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,020
Castle, I'm talking about our case.

95
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,070
If you want me to reconstruct it, I have to do it in order.
Okay, fine. Um...

96
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,880
burnt fingerprints, suffocated,
uh... needle marks.

97
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,570
The morgue. We went to the morgue.

98
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,530
I told you, it's none of your business.

99
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,240
Of course it's none of my business, that's why I want to know.

100
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,140
Know what?

101
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,130
What she and Esposito were fighting about.
It's none of your business.

102
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,520
That's the point.
Where are we?

103
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,020
No ID yet, but his hands have calluses,

104
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,130
so most likely, he had a job that required physical labor.

105
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,530
What about fingerprints? Outer skin's too damaged.

106
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:50,210
But... I may be able to macerate the skin,

107
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,280
pull some from the underside of the epidural layer.

108
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,850
You can do that? Yes, in some cases.

109
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:00,040
But it's gonna take a couple of days.
In the meantime, I did find this.

110
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,480
It was tucked in the fold of his pants pocket.

111
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,960
It would've been real easy for our killer to miss.

112
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,120
"147 West 97th Street, 4:00 P.M."

113
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,350
It's the address of the Cambury Cafe,
half block off Broadway.

114
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,950
4:00 P.M. he was meeting someone. Or met someone.

115
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,910
Okay, you and Esposito take this up there and see

116
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:21,570
if anyone remembers seeing our victim. Maybe that'll help us ID him.

117
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,420
On it.

118
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:26,850
What was so special about our victim
that our killer wanted to erase his identity?

119
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,420
Don't say spy.

120
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,790
Or mob hit.
Mob hit of a spy?

121
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,770
Crazy theories aren't gonna help,
not until we figure out who this guy is.

122
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,430
Beckett? What?

123
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,370
This is a postal bar code.

124
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,600
Our victim wrote this note on the back of an envelope. A postal bar code?

125
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,740
Yeah, those little hash marks you see on mailing labels and envelopes.

126
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,190
It's a way of exactly identifying an address.

127
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,370
But in a machine-readable way.

128
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:59,630
We get that decoded,
we'll be able to tell exactly where our victim was when he wrote that note.

129
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:04,910
Okay, then we called the post office,
and they gave us the address.

130
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,950
The house in Queens.

131
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,900
So do you know what Lanie and Esposito were fighting about?

132
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,890
Everything. They both want to be together,

133
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,150
but neither of them wants to admit to it.

134
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:19,980
Ugh. Why do people do that to themselves?
Maybe they just don't see it.

135
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,320
How could they not? It's so obvious.

136
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,110
This is the place? Matches the address.

137
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,030
Doesn't look like anybody's home.

138
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,410
Hello?

139
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,270
NYPD. Anybody here?

140
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,510
Hello?

141
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,790
Anybody here?

142
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,800
Bill and Nora Ranford.
Maybe Bill is our John Doe.

143
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,950
NYPD. Identify yourself.

144
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,930
Help me.

145
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,750
Ma'am. Ma'am, are you okay?

146
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,810
And an old woman in a cage.

147
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,230
Yeah, that's the last thing I remember.

148
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,650
Me, too.

149
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,080
What the hell is going on?

150

It's just, I always spend Christmas with my family.

154
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,440
Right. Well, you were the one who decided to get hitched, bro.

155

Yeah, but I didn't think that meant driving down to Florida

156
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,280
to spend the holidays with her grandmother.

157
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,890
Driving? You're not flying?

158
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,540
During the holidays? Are you kidding me?

159
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,500
Besides, Jenny thinks that, a-a road trip will give us some quality time together.

160
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,350
That is no road trip, brother.

161
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,610
That... is a relationship test.

162
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:59,610
A relationship test? We're getting married in a month.

163
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,560
Well, we'll see what happens after the test.

164
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,550
It's the pre-wedding road trip test.

165
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,300
Locked together for hours,

166
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,550
that way she can confront you with any lingering doubts

167
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,430
she may have about your future together.

168
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:12,420
And you... will have nowhere to hide.

169
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,910
HEY,Have either of you seen Beckett?

170
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:19,230
She's probably following up on a lead. Don't think that I don't know

171
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,300
that you guys cover for each other.

172
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,720
Mm. What's that? Any progress on our John Doe?

173
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,870
Yeah. Turned out, he did show up at the Cambury Cafe yesterday,

174
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,740
and he wasn't alone. Waitress recognized him immediately,

175
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,290
said he sat in the corner booth,
met with a guy-- long hair, goatee--

176
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,470
said our vic looked nervous.

177
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,610
We have the waitress working with an artist

178
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:42,390
to see if we can come up with a sketch of the goateed man to use on a canvass.

179
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,760
All right. Keep me apprised.

180
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,220
Come on, Jenny loves me. She wouldn't test me like that.

181
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,410
Right.

182
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,820
Just watch out if she wants to take you canoeing.

183
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,130
Okay?

184
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,690
Canoeing? C-canoeing is a test?

185
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:03,090
It's all about power, direction, like a marriage.

186
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:06,420
If the canoe goes straight, it shows her that you can compromise,

187
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,700
work together, find a rhythm, move forward in the same direction.

188
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,690
But if it's going around in circles,

189
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,590
so is your relationship.

190
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,390
Castle, would you just work with me?

191
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:21,760
How about you work with me? How come you always have to lead?

192
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,550
How come you always have to step on my toes?

193
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,380
Since when do I-- okay, you know what?

194
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:31,190
Tell me this-- why do you always have to be first?

195
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,150
First out of the elevator, first through the door.

196
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,910
Um, I am a cop. I'm the one with a gun.

197
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,340
Being first through the door is my job.

198
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,140
In the elevator? Look, how about this?

199
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,600
Would it kill ya to let someone open the door for you
once in a while?

200
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,620
You do realize, if somebody opens the door for me,

201
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:52,120
then I will be going through it first anyway, right?
Oh, yeah, that's right. I forgot.

202
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,920
You have to be the smartest, too.
Everything's a competition with you.

203
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,260
That is so not true.
Are you always like this in the mornings?

204
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,910
You know, I'd argue with you, but then I'd have to let you win.

205
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:02,120
Okay, fine. Go ahead. You lead.

206
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,680
Thank you.

207
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,340
Where did you want to go?

208
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,540
I think that there's a light switch over there.

209
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,630
Or do you want to stay in the dark?
Ooh. I liked it better in the dark.

210
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,590
This door is steel. There's no way we're getting through here.

211
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,820
These walls are cinder block.

212
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,080
What do you suppose is in that big freezer?

213
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,570
You think it's the old woman?

214
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:39,300
I mean, what if we're in some psycho's lair
and we have to kill each other, like in "Saw"?

215
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,220
Castle, stop speculating. It's not helping.

216
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,570
Oh, come on. An old lady in a cage,

217
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,400
us cuffed together in this creepy room.

218
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,250
What am I supposed to think?

219
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,950
You're supposed to think that we need
to get the hell outta here before someone comes back.

220
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,120
How long do you think we were out?

221
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,170
Couple of hours.
How can you tell?

222
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,470
'Cause I'm hungry.

223
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,140
I got some beef jerky.

224
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,930
What?
Hold my hand.

225
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:06,030
So the cuffs don't cut into us.

226
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,020
We could just try to get 'em off. You got a bobby pin?

227
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,180
What is this, the 1940s?

228
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,900
These are my police cuffs.
You're not gonna open them with a bobby pin.

229
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,280
Face it. We're stuck.

230
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,540
Think anyone knows we're missing?

231
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,310
Martha and Alexis will notice if you don't go home, right?

232
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,970
Actually, my mother's taking Alexis on a tour of colleges this weekend.

233
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,000
Esposito and Ryan--

234
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,750
Yeah, they'll probably notice, but it doesn't mean they'll...

235
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,550
find us here. What is that?

236
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,190
It's a hatch. If we can get up there, we might be able to get out.

237
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:47,270
Yeah, well, it's too high.
Not if we climb on top of that.

238
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,060
That was Lanie.

239
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:55,260
Preliminary autopsy report shows that our victim
was in fact smothered.

240
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,340
Guy his size, you'd think he'd put up more of a struggle.

241
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:01,000
He couldn't. Tox report showed that his system was flooded with so much sedative

242
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,300
that it could put down an elephant.
Where are we with that sketch?

243
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,190
Well, I got unis looking through mug books

244
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,650
and I sent a team uptown to canvass.

245
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,830
Still not back, huh? No.

246
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,390
It's been hours.

247
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,110
Every time I call, it goes straight to voice mail.
You think they're really running down a lead?

248
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,150
What lead?

249
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,520
There was nothing new on the board when we came back.

250
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,970
You think you can hit up dispatch,

251
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:30,360
see if they'll run a trace on the transponder
in Beckett's unit?

252
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,980
I want to know where they are.

253
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,050
Ohh! I can't get a good angle on it.
Yeah. Try this.

254
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,380
Ready? You better not be enjoying this, Castle.

255
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,170
I'll let you know in a minute.

256
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:51,180
One, two, three.
Push.

257
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,400
Oh. Okay.

258
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,480
Whatever's in here is a hell of a lot heavier
than a little old lady.

259
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,690
It's like... it's filled with rocks.

260
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,390
What if we emptied it? That's a great idea, Castle,

261
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:11,370
except it's locked, and I'm fresh out of bolt cutters.

262
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,100
Yeah, but it's a combo lock. So?

263
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,790
So when I was writing "Storm Rising,"

264
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,290
I studied with one of the best safe crackers in the biz.

265
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:23,790
I can open this. I just don't know if we want to.

266
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,280
Let's get crackin', Castle, before our captors get back.

267
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,010
Transponder says her unit's right over here.

268
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,830
That's definitely Beckett's car.

269
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:58,620
Looks like it's been dumped.
Yeah, call it in.

270
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:11,610
Time stamp puts this at five hours ago. So that's Beckett's car.

271
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,900
But that's not Castle or Beckett.

272
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,920
And he's not alone. Someone picked him up.
Do we know who they are?

273
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,340
No clue.
Can we get a plate number?

274
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,420
Too far away.
I also ran Beckett and Castle's cells.

275
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,720
They're both off grid.
What the hell did Castle get her into?

276
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,430
I want CSU on that car

277
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:33,490
with a fine-tooth comb for any possible trace evidence.

278
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:37,160
They were working the John Doe with you.
Where could they have gone?

279
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,090
Been over it a dozen times. We still don't know.

280
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,770
And still no hits on our long-haired man from the cafe.

281
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,990
Do whatever it takes to get an ID on that victim

282
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:46,370
and find out what in the hell he was into.

283
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,370
If Beckett and Castle are still out there, then they're running out of time.

284
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:05,840
Oh, for God sake, Castle.
How much longer are you gonna keep doing this?

285
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,180
Oh, I almost had it.
Yeah. Like you had it the last hundred times.

286
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,090
Oh, ye of little faith.

287
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,290
You know, you would make a terrible conjoined twin.
Can I have my hand back?

288
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,210
So you got a story to explain all of this--

289
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:25,060
the old woman in the cage, John Doe with his identity removed,

290
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,220
us handcuffed but still alive?

291
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,590
Yeah, I don't think that's a story you want to hear.
Why not?

292
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:33,810
With those elements, I can't think of a version that ends well,

293
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:38,370
not even a Disney version.
Yeah, I was afraid of that.

294
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:43,610
The good news is, we've been gone long enough,

295
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,720
they've started to look for us by now.

296
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,240
Hundred and first time's the charm?

297
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,950
Come on, Lanie. There's gotta be something else about this guy from this autopsy.

298
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,080
He was in the beginning stages of heart disease.

299
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,070
He had a degenerative hip condition,

300
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:04,920
and mild scoliosis, probably from sitting too much,

301
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,850
and the last thing he had to eat

302
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:10,690
was a pastrami sandwich-- none of which will get you an ID.

303
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,660
His hands were callused, suggesting physical labor,

304
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,420
and yet--and yet, he spent too much time sitting?

305
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,690
Maybe he drove a forklift. I don't know.

306
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:20,370
Come on. We need something concrete, now.
Then I can't help you.

307
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:23,080
Lanie, they're out there.
God knows where or what kind of trouble they're in.

308
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,940
You don't think I want to help? They're my friends, too.

309
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:35,410
So Beckett said,
with enough time, you might be able to recover prints.

310
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,270
Yeah, in a couple of days. Why? What happens if you do it now?

311
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,560
I could damage the print beyond recognition.

312
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,170
"Could." So it's possible that it might not, right?

313
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,680
We gotta do something.

314
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,710
-I did it.
- You did it! - Ha ha!

315
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:15,220
How bad can it be?
I mean, we've seen dead bodies before, right?

316
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,100
Right.

317
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,530
It's not a body. No.

318
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,010
It's worse.

319
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,310
Manacles and bloody instruments of torture.

320
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:45,610
Yeah, looks like your crazed, sadistic, psycho killer theory might not be far off, Castle.

321
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,630
Well, I don't know whether to be smug or horrified. I vote for motivated.

322
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:50,670
Right you are. Let's get the hell outta here.

323
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,370
Javi.

324
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,360
What?

325
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,910
I can feel your impatience all over my backside,

326
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:07,280
and rushing me is never a good idea.

327
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,050
You're talking about that print, right?

328
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,410
Damn it.

329
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:17,280
- What? - It tore.

330
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,600
I guess the skin wasn't softened enough.

331
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,050
It's ruined. Is any of it usable?

332
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:25,480
I might be able to salvage some from the middle. Why?

333
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,890
So what we did...

334
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,780
was, we were able to join the partials from that scrap of paper

335
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:34,090
with the, uh, print pieces that Lanie recovered.

336
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,480
Our victim is Hank Spooner.

337
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,830
An independent trucker out of San Antonio. Owns and operates his own rig.

338
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,240
What was he doing in New York?

339
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,470
Well, according to his folks, he got a contract last week

340
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:47,800
to pick up a load from Del Rio, Texas,
and bring it to Queens.

341
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,150
Last they heard from him was two days ago.

342
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,800
What was the cargo?

343
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,550
Well, all Spooner told 'em was he got a last-minute call

344
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:59,190
from a special client who was paying him big money.

345
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:02,060
His folks also said, it's unusual for him to be staying in a motel.

346
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,280
Apparently, Spooner never stayed in the city.

347
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,540
He thought it was safer and cheaper to stay in his truck.

348
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,420
We need to find that vehicle.

349
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,750
Get an APB out to all the major truck stops.

350
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,060
If we're lucky, it may tell us why someone wanted Hank Spooner dead.

351
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,150
I think maybe I can help answer that.

352
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,930
You looking for me?

353
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,720
Chuck Martinez, DEA.

354
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,880
How did you know we were looking for you, agent Martinez?

355
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,350
We had Spooner's files tagged.

356
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,670
He's a person of interest, so I got notified when you ran his prints.

357
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,470
Why did you meet with him yesterday?

358
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,450
Your man's dead, agent Martinez, and two of my folks are missing.

359
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:48,230
We don't have time for jurisdictional games,
so I'll ask you again, what's your interest in Spooner?

360
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,650
All right.

361
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,610
About a half a dozen times a year,

362
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:57,830
Spooner takes a contract from Texas to New York,

363
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:01,490
but he always makes a pick up in Del Rio.
It's a little border town.

364
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,790
You think he's smuggling drugs from Mexico?

365
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,480
The cartels are really active in these towns.

366
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,960
They're extremely brutal. And if you knew Spooner was involved,

367
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,470
why didn't you arrest him? All the signs were there, okay?

368
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:14,070
But all we had him on was suspicious activity, and we don't want the errand boy.

369
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:17,500
We want the people he works for. How'd you end up at that cafe?

370
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,920
We needed some leverage. So we set up a sting,

371
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:26,150
posing as runners looking to hire him to move some product, only Spooner made my guy.

372
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:29,570
Now instead of running, Spooner--he wanted to meet.

373
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,140
Okay? And he was scared.

374
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,950
He wanted out, and he was afraid of what they would do to him
if he walked away.

375
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,550
So he agreed to tell us everything

376
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:40,410
if I guaranteed him safety, and I took that to my bosses, they agreed.

377
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:42,740
But by then, he was already dead. Right.

378
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,290
Excuse me.

379
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,880
So where were your colleagues when they went missing?

380
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,900
We don't know. We just know they were on the case.

381
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,420
Did Spooner say anything to you about the New York operation?

382
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:02,240
All he said was, "It's not at all what you think."

383
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,410
Troopers found a semi.

384
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:09,180
Truck stop north of the city.
Let's go, boys.

385
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:14,310
According to truck stop records,
the rig's been parked here for three days.

386
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:18,580
No one's seen the driver for two.
You're gonna want to take a look inside.

387
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,470
That's hair.
These could be air holes.

388
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,880
Hey, over here.

389
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,140
Still too high.
Not if I climb on your shoulders.

390
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,950
What? We've done it before.
Yeah, you say that like it was pleasant,

391
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:53,020
and we weren't handcuffed.
Who's got no faith now?

392
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,950
Come on, Castle. We have no idea when they're coming back

393
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:57,680
or even if they're coming back at all.

394
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:01,310
Last time, you were wearing sneakers.
Fine.

395
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,440
I think I'm gonna need your help.

396
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,060
"Lift up my shirt, pull off my boots."

397
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,570
You know, under normal circumstances,
I would like where this was heading.

398
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:14,010
You can fantasize later, after we get out of the room.

399
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,590
Just so you know, not as much fun if I have your permission.

400
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,750
How do you run in these things?

401
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,750
Shut up and pull.

402
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:25,550
Agent Martinez, are you sure these guys were smuggling drugs?

403
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,330
You know, if I had answers, I'd share.

404
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:29,560
- Captain Gates. - What'd you find?

405
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,980
- Waybills. - Spooner delivered
to a furniture store in lower Manhattan two days ago.

406
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,650
Get on it. YUP.

407
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,850
Call your bosses.

408
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:41,680
Tell 'em I want all the files on this investigation.

409
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,560
I'm getting my people back.

410
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,340
Okay, ready?

411
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,620
- Ready. - One.

412
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,490
Two.

413
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,620
Three. Oh! Oh, jeez.

414
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,820
Castle!

415
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,510
Okay, can you put me down? Okay. Easy.

416
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,500
If we ever get outta here,
we should seriously consider joining the circus.

417
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,300
Let me try it from behind, okay?

418
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,470
All right. I'm game.

419
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:17,970
Okay.

420
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:18,930
- Ready? - Ready.

421
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:21,660
One. Two. Three.

422
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,440
Oh, okay. Oh. Okay.

423
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,040
Okay, I'm lifting my right hand. Ready?
Okay.

424
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,770
Not so fun as I would've thought.

425
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:40,760
You know, I'm getting a little tired of you walking all over me.

426
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,660
It's open.

427
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,440
Okay, I think I can pull my--

428
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:57,320
Hey! Let us outta here!
What do you want from us?

429
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,160
Captain Gates.

430
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:08,080
The furniture store owner verified that he took delivery from Spooner a couple of days ago.

431
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,990
But he said it was just a couple of coffee tables, packed near the rear of the truck.

432
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:13,990
And you believed him?
He's a family man, didn't have any priors.

433
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:17,040
But he did say something happened during the delivery,
something weird.

434
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,130
As they were unloading the shipment,
a box fell off a stack and hit him in the shoulder.

435
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:22,610
He said the box must have been empty,
'cause it bounced right off of him.

436
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:26,180
He tried to joke with Spooner,
asked him if he was shipping cotton candy or air,

437
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,870
but Spooner kind of got squirrely, said it was just

438
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,790
a couple of empties that were packed there to fill some space.

439
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:33,100
The owner thought it wasn't a big deal, but then he heard something from behind the boxes,

440
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,960
something that sounded like breathing.

441
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:39,390
So Spooner takes a few small, legitimate jobs

442
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,760
in order to justify his smuggling trips,

443
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,400
and places a wall of empties in front of

444
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,080
whatever his real cargo is.

445
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,660
D-did the owner have any idea where Spooner was headed?

446
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,560
None.

447
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,980
Beckett and Castle were on to something.
Where in the hell did they go?

448
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,470
Well, the only thing we had at the time

449
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,970
was this address. And we were already covering it.

450
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,490
Oh, they must have seen or heard something that you didn't.

451
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,810
Okay, I want you guys to--

452
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,130
Go! Go! Go!

453
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,160
NYPD!
NYPD!

454
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,770
NYPD!

455
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:19,950
Hold position!

456
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:27,530
Room clear! Clear!

457
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:32,730
This place is empty.
You really think this is where they went?

458
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:35,010
If they were here, they're not here now.

459
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:38,170
Hey, detective. Look in here. There's some kind of hatch.

460
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:40,390
All right. Let's seal it off and process it.

461
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,640
Damn it. It's hard-cased steel, Castle.

462
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,810
We're not getting out of these without keys.

463
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:05,280
You know, there is another way.

464
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:10,060
We don't go through the cuffs. You... mean...

465
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:13,170
"Mad Max." "127 Hours."

466
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,020
Are you offering to cut off your own hand?

467
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,350
Whoa. Mine? No. I was thinking about yours.

468
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:20,920
My hand? Why my hand?
It's smaller.

469
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,640
They're coming.

470
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,280
Tell him it's a good price.

471
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,080
And if he likes her, I got two more that fell into my lap

472
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,420
that I could sell you at a discount. I just need to move 'em now.

473
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,140
That sounds like Arabic.

474
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,160
They're going to the other room.

475
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,780
Castle, someone else is in there.

476
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,920
She is very beautiful. Just like you asked.

477
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,820
They're holding someone else. The old woman?

478
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,000
No, it's more like a girl, like--

479
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,440
Like they're trying to sell her. It's human trafficking.

480
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,700
That's what this is.

481
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,930
They're abducting and selling people.
That's why we're still alive.

482
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:11,980
They're not gonna kill us. They're gonna sell us.

483
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,700
What? I'm a best-selling author.

484
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:19,060
I wonder what I'd be worth. Let's not find out, okay?

485
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,570
Yeah, still...

486
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,710
Anything? From the cut marks,

487
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,880
looks like this hatch was just installed.

488
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,500
Any idea why? No.

489
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,890
CSU is gonna sweep for prints and trace.

490
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:35,680
What did the neighbors say?
Ah, that the bank foreclosed on the previous owners,

491
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,450
Bill and Nora Ranford, six months ago,

492
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:41,860
but a couple of weeks ago, new neighbors moved in.
Get an ID?

493
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,890
They kinda kept a low profile.

494
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:47,130
But neighbors think that there were two of them,
brothers, and they got an ID on their ride.

495
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:50,720
Black F-150.
A black F-150?

496
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,380
That means Beckett and Castle were here.

497
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:55,080
Not only that, but a couple of nights ago,
guy from across the street

498
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,090
says he hears some noises in the middle of the night, 

499
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,600
so he goes to the window, and sees a semi pulling up.

500
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,590
Spooner was here, too?

501
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:04,040
Yeah. Whatever was going on, this was the place.

502
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,280
Why don't you wake up the registrar? See who bought this property.

503
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:11,520
I want to know who these guys are.
Hello, can you hear us?

504
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,650
Castle, I can hear somebody breathing.
Maybe she's sedated.

505
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:20,020
Hello. Can you hear us?

506
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:27,880
This wall is stucco and tile. So?

507
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,260
So the others are all cinder block.

508
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:33,530
If we start digging,
we might be able to break through and help her.

509
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:37,300
How is getting out of one prison and into another
gonna help any of us?

510
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:41,850
Well, let me ask you this,
if it was Alexis on the other side, what would you do?

511
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,620
Yeah. Okay.

512
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:52,430
The moment you hear. Thanks.
CSU?

513
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:56,910
Yeah. Negative on prints from the house.
Place was wiped.

514
00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:00,860
What'd you get from the registrar?
Well, the house was foreclosed on five months ago,

515
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,640
it's still owned by National Bank.
Our guys must have been squatting.

516
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,610
Did you say National Bank?
Yeah, why?

517
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:07,860
The files agent Martinez sent over.

518
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,140
Hang on.

519
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,630
Spooner made a delivery to a Brooklyn house two months ago.

520
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:17,240
A couple of days later, the feds raided the place,

521
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,530
but by then, whoever was in the house was gone.

522
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:22,410
All they found was a hatch cut into the floor, which accessed the basement.

523
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,880
Sounds familiar.
Yeah, but when they traced the property,

524
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,620
it was bank owned, by National Bank.

525
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,340
Our guys must be targeting distressed properties

526
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,490
- to run their operations from. - Okay, get a list

527
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,760
of all the National Bank-owned properties in the New York area,

528
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,770
starting with the properties that have a basement.

529
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,680
If they're working off the National Bank foreclosure list,

530
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,090
that may be where they're finding their safe houses.

531
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,010
Okay, that should do it.
Shift.

532
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,240
Okay.

533
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,000
Okay, ready? Ready.

534
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,090
Go.

535
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,260
Shift over. Okay.

536
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,300
Okay. Together. Ready?

537
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,250
- Yeah. - Go.

538
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:17,870
I've always liked your legs, but now I respect them.

539
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:20,680
Yeah, yours aren't so bad either. You know, for the next police picnic,

540
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,450
we should do the three-legged race together.

541
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:24,300
You're on. All right.

542
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,770
Hello!

543
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:31,040
Can you hear us? I suppose you want to go in first.

544
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,820
No. You go ahead.

545
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,430
- Don't mind if I do. - Okay.

546
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,790
Hello! Are you there? We're here to--

547
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,350
A tiger?!

548
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,530
Yeah, it's a tiger. It almost bit my face off.

549
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:02,390
Wait. No, that explains the cage and--and the chains

550
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:03,890
and the butcher knives for the raw meat.

551
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:06,020
A tiger? That's what they were haggling over.

552
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:06,890
Yeah, well, tigers are endangered.

553
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:09,350
Trafficking them is illegal. We walked in on their operation.

554
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,720
Yeah, walking in on their operation is not our problem right now.

555
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,960
That tiger walking in here is our problem.

556
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,080
Don't worry, Castle. She's not gonna get through that wall.

557
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,820
Hey, back! Get back!

558
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,960
Is it just me, or does she look a little bit hungry?

559
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:28,020
Yeah, that's bad. What are you doing?

560
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:31,060
I'm just gonna buy us some good will.

561
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,350
No, no, no, Castle, don't go near her.

562
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:40,400
She's going for it. Yeah, and then when she's done with that,

563
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,410
she'll want more. Oh, God! She's coming!

564
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,820
So National Bank has close to a hundred properties

565
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,300
in foreclosure in the outer boroughs,

566
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,750
but our folks have certain needs, so we filtered out

567
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,890
all the ones without basements.

568
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,840
Come on, Castle. We gotta cover that hole.

569
00:33:58,210 --> 00:33:59,330
Push.

570
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,570
Again.

571
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:09,870
The two houses we know they used had other common elements-- close freeway access,

572
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:12,210
long, wide driveways that could fit a semi.

573
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:14,310
And both are situated in between empty lots

574
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:16,880
or unoccupied houses, minimizing the nosy neighbor factor.

575
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:21,010
Now you cross-reference all that,
it leaves us with 11 likelies in the outer boroughs.

576
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,110
Beckett.

577
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,220
What do we do? Divvy up the list.

578
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,510
Get unis out to all 11 properties,

579
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,870
and let's bring them back alive.

580
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,470
We get in the freezer. It'll latch, and we'll suffocate.

581
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:39,850
Would you rather be eaten? I was looking for option three.

582
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,790
Get behind me.

583
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,630
I have a plan.

584
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,700
817 Fincher Drive.

585
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:55,970
Industrial building foreclosed on eight months ago.

586
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,280
Looks empty, just like the last three places.

587
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,790
Let's do a walk around.
See if there's anything in back.

588
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:04,790
Yeah.

589
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,480
This is your plan?

590
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,100
Do you know how high tigers can jump?

591
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,440
High.

592
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,320
Well, we're still alive, aren't we?

593
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,530
Okay.

594
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,360
Esposito, over here.

595
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,290
Call for backup.

596
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,950
Remember what I said about joining the circus?

597
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,310
- Uh-huh. - Changed my mind.

598
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,260
She's playing with us.

599
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,650
She's gonna knock it over. What are we gonna do?

600
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:08,810
There's only one thing to do.
Scream like little girls.

601
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:10,340
Help!

602
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,450
Help!
Help!

603
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,760
- Get us outta here! - Wait. Listen.

604
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,640
- Help! Somebody! - You hear that?

605
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,960
- Yeah. - Come on! We're down here!

606
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:24,120
Help! Somebody, help us!

607
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:27,040
Help! Help!

608
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,240
Beckett, Castle.

609
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,410
Esposito. Is that a tiger?!

610
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:34,560
Yeah, yeah, that's a tiger.

611
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:36,720
Hey, how about getting us out?

612
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,260
O-okay, hang on. We'll-- we'll be right there.

613
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,850
Drop the hardware, boys, or I'll blow you both away.

614
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:45,730
Help! Help us!

615
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:47,750
You guys, open the hatch!

616
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:53,340
- Guys! - Ryan, Espo, help!

617
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,720
- Open the door, boys! - Help!

618
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:05,720
Put your weapon down.

619
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,390
Doesn't matter which one of us you shoot first,

620
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:10,200
whoever's left standing will kill you.

621
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,640
Maybe I'll shoot the pretty one first.

622
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:20,000
Luckily, I don't gotta choose.
Y'all put 'em down.

623
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:23,210
You first.
Let's just kill 'em, ma.

624
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:25,420
Let Tony the tiger have at the others like we planned.

625
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,850
Get us outta here!
Open the door!

626
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:30,230
The stakes are considerably raised!

627
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,550
Help!

628
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,160
- Help! - Help us!

629
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,850
- Your boys shoot... - Get us outta here!

630
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:38,830
I swear, the last thing I do is put a bullet right through your head.

631
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,970
- Your choice. - Come on. Hurry up!

632
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:43,620
You New Yorkers ain't nearly as scary as a Texas lawman.

633
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:46,730
That being said, I'm betting more of you are gonna be here soon,

634
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:48,550
so I'm gonna tell you what's gonna happen.

635
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:51,320
Me and my boys are gonna back on outta here.

636
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,960
You either get yourselves killed trying to stop us...

637
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,510
or you can forget all about us and go save your friends.
That's your choice.

638
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,980
I'm so sorry. I've got nothing else.

639
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,600
Javi? Kate--

640
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,940
No, Castle, I did not survive a bullet to the heart

641
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,460
to die as tiger kibble.

642
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,040
Let 'em go.

643
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,180
Oh, God.

644
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:50,210
It ate 'em. It didn't eat us.

645
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:54,080
But it will if you don't hurry.

646
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,640
Nice hangout.

647
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:06,010
Nobody move!

648
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,600
Handcuffed together that long?
I'm surprised you two didn't kill each other.

649
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,780
Yeah, well, there were a couple of moments.

650
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:19,960
Until we found our rhythm. I think we'll fly to Florida.

651
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:24,660
What? I believe this is yours.

652
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,660
- This, too. - Thank you.

653
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,980
How did you guys...

654
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:33,740
even find us?

655
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,780
Well, we followed your bread crumbs, and it led us here.

656
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,410
And lucky for all of us, some of my detectives

657
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:40,750
keep me informed as to their whereabouts.

658
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,390
Thanks to you two,

659
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:45,560
I'm instituting a new policy in our department--

660
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,360
no one goes anywhere...

661
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,590
without calling it in.

662
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,580
Thanks, you guys. Really appreciate that.

663
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:59,680
Well, at least we won't have to look so hard next time we save your ass.

664
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,650
I missed you, by the way.

665
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:01,790
- Really? Prove it. - Oh, I'll prove it.

666
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,620
- How was that tiger? - Espo, stop it.

667
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:06,540
- What? - Was it gr-r-reat? Her name is Ruth Spurloch.

668
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,400
And it turns out, her and her sons

669
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,160
were major suppliers of endangered tigers to wealthy customers all around the world.

670
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,530
Hard to believe it's worth killing for.

671
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:17,350
The exotic animal trade's a billion-dollar industry.

672
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:21,290
And Texas, which has almost no regulations, is one of the few places in the world

673
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:24,020
where selling and breeding tigers is not illegal.

674
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:27,030
Ruth and her boys were making millions off her breeding farm.

675
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:29,910
Spooner would truck them from Del Rio up to New York.

676
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,430
And then wealthy clients would smuggle them

677
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:34,100
past customs and ship 'em out on their private jets.

678
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,120
Right.
Except outside of Texas,

679
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:39,260
trafficking endangered species is a criminal offense.

680
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:42,020
So Ruth didn't want Spooner ratting her out.

681
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:45,810
Which is why, when we showed up at her house, she played the victim so she could get the drop on us.

682
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:48,870
Yeah, and knocked us out using animal tranquilizers, which can't be good for me.

683
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:51,240
I-I still have a taste in my mouth.

684
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,040
Yeah.

685
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,250
Well, I...

686
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:58,590
I'm--I'm gonna turn the trafficking case over to the FBI and customs.

687
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,970
You can coordinate with them on your murder charge.

688
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:03,920
Thank you, agent Martinez. I'll walk you out.

689
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,200
As expected, the hair from the truck is tiger,

690
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,380
and the blood is from raw meat.

691
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:14,750
They used the hatches to throw down food to the cats or sedate them with darts.

692
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:17,390
So what's gonna happen with that tiger anyway? Shoot him.

693
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:20,600
She'll get transferred to a sanctuary.

694
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,130
Or that. Probably end up in a zoo.

695
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:26,910
Why, you want to go and visit her? No. No, thanks. I'm good.

696
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,800
- All right, you guys get some rest. - You, too.

697
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,700
Yeah.
That has gotta be the strangest brush with death I've ever had.

698
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,640
Me, too. But I'll tell you, after that experience,

699
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,920
if I ever have to be hitched to someone, it would be you.

700
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,140
Hitched? Hitched?

701
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:45,960
No, I didn't say "hitched." I said "cuffed."
Handcuffed, not hitched--

702
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,910
the colloquial or any other connotation or meaning.

703
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:49,720
It's okay, Castle. I understood what you meant.

704
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,070
And for what it's worth, if I ever have to spend

705
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:54,540
another night handcuffed to someone again,

706
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,990
I wouldn't mind if it was you either.

707
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,360
Really?

708
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:02,210
But next time, let's do it without the tiger.

709
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,900
Next time?

710
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:17,830
