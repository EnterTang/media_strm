1
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,300
Alexandria Motel

2
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,580
I'm telling you, something happened,
something changed.

3
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,420
It's been weird between us lately.
Lately?

4
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,610
Kate, it's been weird for four years.

5
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,590
No, this is different.

6
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,610
He's different. It's like he's pulling away.

7
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,630
Well, can you blame him? He's probably tired of waiting.

8
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,350
Waiting for what?
What do you think?

9
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,050
The guy is crazy about you.

10
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:47,100
And despite your little act, you're crazy about him.

11
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,430
Oh, what, was that supposed to be some big secret?

12
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,010
Yes.

13
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:55,430
No.

14
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,650
Do you think he knows?

15
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,330
You remember how he used to be,
girl on either arm?

16
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,810
You really don't see that guy too much anymore.

17
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:06,320
Why do you think that is?

18
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,500
<i>He's waiting for you.</i>

19
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,480
Yeah, but, Lanie...
I know. You're dealing with stuff.

20
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,370
But you cannot ask him to wait forever.

21
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,330
Unless, of course, you're okay with him pulling away.

22
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,060
What if it doesn't work?
What if it ends up like you and Javi?

23
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,050
Well, at least we gave it a shot.
And so it didn't work out. So what?

24
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,330
Now we can move on, give or take the occasional booty call.

25
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,580
I just... I don't want to lose what we have, you know?

26
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,040
Girl, please.

27
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,270
What exactly do you have, really?

28
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,890
A friendship.

29
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,770
No. What you and I have is a friendship.

30
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,550
What you and Castle have is a holding pattern.

31
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,190
How long can you circle before the fuel runs out?

32
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:03,880
Beckett.

33
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,880
Don't think you were saved by the bell, Kate Beckett.

34
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,740
As your friend, I'm not gonna let this drop.

35
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:13,140
<i>So what, you think I should tell him how I feel?
Yes.</i>

36
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,280
You Hunt murderers for a living. You can do this.
Okay. Okay.

37
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,580
I just... I-I have to find the right time.
No time like the present.

38
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,200
What the...

39
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,960
On second thought,
maybe you should wait a bit.

40
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,660
What's that? Ryan's calling. I gotta go.

41
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,120
I'll call you in about an hour.

42
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:49,920
Hey there.
I feel like I just walked into a bad episode of "Miami Vice. "

43
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,380
Okay, first, there are no bad episodes of "Miami Vice. "

44
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,240
Second, who died?
You from the looks of it.

45
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,020
You look like you just got run over by a truck.

46
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,660
Yeah,
a truck delivering a shipment of awesome.

47
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,430
No, I just flew into Vegas for the weekend.
Just needed a little change of scenery.

48
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,180
And you won the blonde in a high-stakes poker match?
No, I met her on the flight back.

49
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,810
And you just gave her your car?
Jacinda happens to be a very trustworthy person.

50
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,210
She's a first-class flight attendant.
It's not like I gave her my social security number.

51
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,030
Castle...

52
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:19,100
Is everything okay?
Never better.

53
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,360
Our victim's Naomi Allen, age 25.

54
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,000
Her green card indicates that she's a British national.

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,040
Ryan is notifying the consulate.
Her address is in Soho.

56
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,700
What was she doing all the way down here?

57
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,560
Don't know, but she checked in
two hours before she was killed.

58
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,530
I hope they prorated the room.
Good news is, we have a witness.

59
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,110
The maid who discovered the body saw a guy run out.
Did the maid get a good look?

60
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,200
She's with the sketch artist now.
Well, whoever he is, he was looking for something.

61
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,740
This place has been searched.
The one thing we do know is that she was not robbed.

62
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,710
Her wallet, watch, and cash were untouched.

63
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,170
Hey, Lanie, how does it look?
Like you waited too long.

64
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:03,590
The vic.
She was strangled but she went down with a fight.

65
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:07,640
Prelim suggests a sign of a struggle.
She took one to the face.

66
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,730
A well-dressed, attractive woman in a seedy motel

67
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,970
and a guy who flees the crime scene...

68
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,730
This might have been a one-night stand gone wrong.

69
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,580
Are we talking about the victim or Castle?
Hey, Espo.

70
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,430
Yeah.

71
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,510
Can you contact the next of kin and canvass the area once the sketch is done?
Yeah, no problem.

72
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,320
Hey, Beckett.

73
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,570
Found the vic's business card
in the side pocket of her purse.

74
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,440
Looks like she works in Manhattan.

75
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,200
"Naomi Allen, Kittman Group. "

76
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:37,950
Kittman Group

77
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,820
Yes, I was her U.S. booking agent.

78
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,490
Naomi was one of our top models.

79
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,280
So she was in the city for work?

80
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,640
She split her time between here and London.

81
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,390
The good ones usually end up spending at least half the year in New York.

82
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,680
Now do you have any idea why she was at the Alexandria motel last night?

83
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,390
Uh, no. I've never even heard of it.

84
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:02,200
It's one of those, um, pay-by-the-hour places.

85
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,900
Do you recognize this man?

86
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,850
No. No, I don't.

87
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,860
But you do have an idea of who he might be.
It's just...

88
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,810
lately,

89
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,500
Naomi was making some choices.

90
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,890
What kind of choices?

91
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:28,850
Well, she seemed to have lost interest
in standard modeling jobs.

92
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:33,510
Recently, she had been booking more, uh,
unconventional gigs.

93
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,540
Like what?
Well, I heard the London office booked her to attend

94
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,680
the birthday party of some foreign dignitary
a few months ago.

95
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,650
She was hired to go to a party?

96
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,360
It's common for models to get hired to pretty-up an event.

97
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,780
Some girls do it to pick up extra cash.

98
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,140
And other girls do it as a way of connecting

99
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,040
with wealthy men.

100
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:58,000
Uh, wait. Are you saying
that Naomi was hiring herself out as an escort?

101
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,460
You just don't see girls as good as Naomi
taking these party jobs.

102
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,060
Not unless there's a bigger payout involved somewhere.

103
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,730
Do you know if she took on
any of these kinds of gigs recently?

104
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,050
It's not really what we do.

105
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,660
She did want me to try to get her into an event last night, though,

106
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,750
uh, an album launch party in midtown.

107
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,480
But I didn't have any connections to it.

108
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,400
Last night?
Yeah.

109
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,490
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

110
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,380
Yeah, that we should throw a party
and hire a bunch of models.

111
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,200
No.

112
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:29,810
That maybe Naomi somehow got into that party last night

113
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,730
and that that's where she met her killer.

114
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:35,950
That's what I was thinking.
Weird. We're usually more in sync than that.

115
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,780
Hey, Ryan.
Did you find anything at Naomi's apartment?

116
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,110
No, but someone else might have. It's been tossed.

117
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:44,810
Not only that, but a neighbor said
they saw a man leaving the apartment late last night.

118
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:48,550
The neighbor I.D.'ed him off the sketch.
It's the same guy who fled the murder scene.

119
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:52,030
He couldn't find what he was looking for
in the motel so he searched her place.

120
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,260
Yeah, but this time, he left a footprint.
Meaning?

121
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,500
Well, UNIS canvassed around the apartment with the sketch.

122
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,570
He bought a bottle of single malt with a credit card
a couple of blocks away.

123
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:05,430
Colin Hunt. What do we have on him?
Nothing in the system, but I ran a trace on the credit card.

124
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,390
He checked into the mondrian Soho this morning.

125
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,190
Here.

126
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:24,020
NYPD. Show me your hands.
You're making a mistake.

127
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,650
<i>Yeah, like I haven't heard that before.
Hands in the air now.</i>

128
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,270
If you insist.

129
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,410
Whoa. Dude. Whoa

130
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,220
Allow me to introduce myself.

131
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,350
Detective Inspector Colin Hunt, Scotland Yard.

135
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,080
You're a long way from home, Detective Inspector Hunt.

136
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,580
How did you end up in that dead girl's motel room?

137
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,470
I was at a seminar in D.C. last night when Naomi called me, panicked.

138
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,560
She said she was in trouble and needed my help.

139
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,380
So you knew her?
Naomi was like a sister to me.

140
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,630
Her dad Terence was my first partner on the job.

141
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,750
When he passed away,

142
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,900
I promised her family that I'd look after her.

143
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,820
After she called me, I grabbed the next flight,
but by the time I arrived, it was too late.

144
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,820
And your first instinct was to flee the crime scene?

145
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,400
I didn't flee. I left.

146
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,660
She was dead.
There was nothing else to do.

147
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,040
Yeah, except maybe to hang around
and give the police a statement.

148
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,760
You and I both know that if I stuck around,

149
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,700
it'd be hours of questioning, and then you'd send me off
with a "cheers, we'll keep you posted. "

150
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,180
But I suppose you had something more important to do.
The room had been searched.

151
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,440
Whoever killed her was looking for something.
I thought they might try her apartment next.

152
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,650
By the time I got there, it had already been tossed.
Look, I know I shouldn't have been investigating,

153
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,640
but if you were in a foreign country
and someone you loved was killed, what would you do?

154
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:52,910
What were they looking for?

155
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,980
When he was on a job, Naomi's dad used to stash a gun
in the lining of his kevlar.

156
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,100
When Naomi started modeling as a teenager,
he didn't want her on the underground without any protection,

157
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,800
so he taught her to cut a tiny piece
of the lining in her jacket to stash pepper spray.

158
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,450
That's where I found it.
You found what?

159
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,000
A message to me about her killer.

160
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,850
What kind of message?

161
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,140
Not until I'm on the case.

162
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,450
Excuse me?

163
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,880
Detective, please,
I owe this to Naomi.

164
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,970
I owe it to her family.

165
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,730
You do realize that I could arrest you
for withholding evidence?

166
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,120
And since you don't know what that evidence is,
I could deny it.

167
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,080
And none of that will get us any closer to catching her killer.

168
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,100
Let me work this case with you,
because if you don't, I swear,

169
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,340
I will go out there and catch the bastard on my own.

170
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,600
Okay.

171
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,500
But I have to check in with my captain first.

172
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,980
What's she like, your captain?

173
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,980
You ever see that Youtube video
of the grizzly bear that decapitates a moose

174
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,610
with one swipe of its paw?

175
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,140
Comforting.
It's nothing personal.

176
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,390
She just doesn't like outsiders in her precinct.

177
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,040
I don't need her to like it. I just need her to allow it.

178
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,160
This whole thing with Naomi doesn't add up.

179
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,270
Turning down conventional modeling jobs,
booking sleazy gigs at private parties...

180
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,350
That just doesn't sound like the Naomi I know.

181
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,090
Yeah, well, sometimes it's the people we think we know best
that we don't really know at all.

182
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,190
Well... You're in.
Thank you.

183
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,300
What?
Seriously?

184
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,460
Yeah, your supervisor at Scotland Yard said you're one of the best.

185
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,980
Even captain gates was impressed with your record.

186
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,870
Well, I guess it's not outsiders she doesn't like.
It's just me.

187
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,950
Look, we had a deal. What did Naomi give you?

188
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,620
This.

189
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,550
A key?

190
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,990
You said she left a message. - This is the message.

191
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,180
She put it in there for me to find.
I guarantee, it has something to do with her death.

192
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,110
This looks commercial.
It's an Arco-Rifkin 11-30-R,

193
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,000
mostly used for lockers like those found at train stations or health clubs.

194
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,520
All right, well, I'll have Ryan canvass the area
around her apartment and the motel.

195
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,370
We'll see if any of the businesses have lockers
that use this kind of key.

196
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,250
Yo, Beckett.
I got something.

197
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,800
Uh, yeah, detective Esposito,
this is Detective Inspector Colin Hunt.

198
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,290
He's from Scotland Yard.
He's gonna be consulting on this case.

199
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,280
He knows our victim. - Hey. How's it going?

200
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,890
Pleasure, mate. - So what do you got?

201
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:25,330
Well, Naomi did make it to that album release party last night
at a club in midtown,

202
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:28,200
but she was kicked out by security around 10:00.
Why?

203
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,330
She had an altercation with the host, female rapper

204
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,580
and ex-felon Nicky Jay.

205
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,110
And she wasn't afraid to take a swing in front of paparazzi.

206
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:41,190
Wow. What was the fight about?
Unclear, but uniforms are bringing her up to interrogation now.

207
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:44,480
Do you usually question them solo?
No, Castle and I usually go in together.

208
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,800
Actually, you know what? Why don't you guys take this one?
Are you sure?

209
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,550
Yeah, absolutely.
Besides, Colin's got a personal interest.

210
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,850
And I really don't now, do I? - Ah. All right.

211
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,640
It's settled then. - Yeah, I guess it is.

212
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:58,620
Yeah, besides, my lunch date is here.
I'll be back in a few hours.

213
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,650
You guys call me if you find anything interesting.

214
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:11,100
Hell, yeah, I clocked her.
She was trying to make a move on my man.

215
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,690
Your man Biggie Slim? - That's right.

216
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,060
She had the nerve to say that he told her to put her digits in his phone.

217
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,430
Did he?
That ain't the point!

218
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,920
That skinny bitch wasn't even supposed to be there.
When I got up in her face,

219
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,060
she said Biggie Slim's cousin Drew told her about the party.

220
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,400
But I knew that was B.S. because Drew wasn't even invited.

221
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,930
It must make you so bloody mad
to know your man has a wandering eye.

222
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,930
I had a girlfriend like that.
Traveled for business.

223
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,050
She'd ring from the airport to say her flight was canceled.

224
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,800
I come to find out, she was seeing some other bloke.

225
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,160
She sound like a ho.

226
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,720
All I'm saying is, I understand your instinct

227
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,300
to lash out at the person you believe is responsible.

228
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,950
I protect what's mine. You should do the same.

229
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,180
Is that why you followed Naomi to the motel

230
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,990
and strangled her with your bare hands?

231
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,300
You must be high.

232
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,840
That skank wasn't worth another second of my time.

233
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,770
I told security to give her the boot,
and that was that.

234
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:07,870
Really? Can you prove it?

235
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,430
My driver brought us home.

236
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,830
And I was with Biggie Slim the rest of the night.

237
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,890
Yeah, I went home with Nicky Jay.

238
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,460
After the tussle, she was all worked up.

239
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,750
But I like it when she gets worked up, when she got something to prove.

240
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,910
She said that the fight started because you were
spending time with this girl.

241
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,860
Oh, yeah, that girl.

242
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,380
Hey, what can I say?

243
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,830
Women are powerless against my good looks and charms.

244
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,330
Yes, it's a real curse.

245
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,450
You and Naomi... What did you talk about?
Ah, a little bit of this, a little bit of that.

246
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,500
She was a bad chick, you know?
But a little off. You know what I'm talking about?

247
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,460
No, what are you talkin' about?
I mean, she was acting paranoid, man,

248
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,340
said somebody had followed her to the party.

249
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,790
I figured she was just blowing smoke.
Why is that?

250
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,010
Look, I don't just produce Nicky Jay, all right?
I'm building my brand.

251
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,350
I got Biggie Slim records, Biggie Slim clothing.

252
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,820
Hell, I even got a Biggie Slim energy drink.

253
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,150
So some filly comes up trying to make her time,

254
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,400
it's just a everyday thing in my life.

255
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,850
Did she tell you who she thought was following her?
Sure didn't.

256
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,630
I guess she wasn't lying, though, huh?

257
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:20,700
Naomi left that party
and then three hours later, she was dead.

258
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,070
Based on what she told Biggie Slim,
Naomi knew somebody was after her.

259
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,550
All right, let's canvass the area around the party venue,
see if she was being followed.

260
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:31,020
And let's track down Nicky Jay and Biggie Slim's driver.
I want to see if they went straight home.

261
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,820
On it.

262
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:37,310
So... that story
that you told Nicky Jay about your girlfriend...

263
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:40,570
Total pants.
I just wanted her to think I sympathized.

264
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:43,180
And honestly, after meeting Biggie Slim,
I do.

265
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,120
Well, maybe she's hanging on,
hoping that he'll change.

266
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,540
Guys like him never do.

267
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:59,190
Our M.E.'s finished the autopsy.
Her larynx is crushed.

268
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:02,730
Whoever did it was strong.
Large hands, probably a male.

269
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,390
That's like half the city.
We may be able to narrow it down a little further than that.

270
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,880
The pressure from the killer's grip

271
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,710
left a print on her neck.

272
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,990
Were you able to pull a print?

273
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:16,120
We recovered a partial
thanks to the body lotion she was wearing.

274
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,370
Is it in the system?

275
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,650
Not enough to run it, but you bring me a print

276
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,760
off a suspect, I can tell you if it's a match.

277
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,200
Excuse me. I have to make a call.

278
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,930
Easy on the eyes.

279
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,260
Cute accent, too. - Mm.

280
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,080
- I just got one question.
- Mm.

281
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:40,750
Where's Castle?

282
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,850
He took off...
for a lunch date.

283
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,660
In a Ferrari full of flight attendant?
Yeah, he's probably trying to rack up

284
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,440
his frequent flyer miles.
I'm sorry.

285
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,360
But you know she's just a passing thing.

286
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,080
Do I? I mean, the guy has been divorced twice,

287
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,980
and he's still chasing bimbos.

288
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,600
Maybe that's just who he is.

289
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,570
Look, maybe it's the wrong time
or maybe he's even the wrong guy,

290
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:10,360
but if he is, how long are you gonna wait to find out?

291
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,710
Ten years, I've been keeping them company

292
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,160
while they spend a night or two here

293
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,380
on their way to where we're all going.

294
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:30,400
They all had plans, Kate,

295
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,240
things they were gonna do when they got around to it...

296
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:37,210
Go on a cruise, lose 10 pounds, fall in love.

297
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,900
They thought they had all the time in the world.

298
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,870
But nobody does.

299
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,440
The personal ones are tough.

300
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,410
No call.

301
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,800
What's my tell?

302
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,480
The brooding lean.

303
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,490
Ah, yes.

304
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,370
Rookie move.

305
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,980
You know, even with a mouth full of braces,
she was the prettiest girl in her class.

306
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:18,030
Although having a cop for a dad didn't do much for her social life.

307
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:21,680
Terry used to interrogate her dates
when they'd drop her off.

308
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,800
I could see how that would weed out the lightweights.

309
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,440
And then when she was 22,
she fell in love with a young doctor, good guy.

310
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,950
He died last year in Africa doing God's work.

311
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,530
I don't think she ever really got over it, because hearing what she was up to,

312
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,120
it's like she was a different person.

313
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,250
People change when you're not looking.

314
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,290
Excuse me.

315
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,160
Hey, Ryan. What's up?
Are you sure?

316
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:52,760
Where?

317
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,470
Okay, great. Call in a warrant.

318
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,820
They found a gym near the motel.

319
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,270
Naomi bought a day pass there the night that she was killed,

320
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,580
and the clerk said she was in and out in three minutes.

321
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:06,280
Just enough time to run in and hide something
in one of the lockers.

322
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:11,000
She bought the day pass at 10:24 P.M.

323
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,690
That's 20 minutes after she called me
to say she was in trouble.

324
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,410
She was leaving me a message.

325
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,630
She did better than leave a message about the killer.

326
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,080
She left us a picture of him as well.

327
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,040
Anything on the number sequence?
We're running it through every database,

328
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,480
but nothing so far. - Naomi wrote it on there for a reason.

329
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,860
What about the photo?

330
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,520
Well, based on the light and background architecture,
this photo was taken in midtown New York.

331
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:49,120
Hey. What did I miss?
Not much.

332
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:52,420
Oh, we did manage to find that mystery locker.

333
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,710
And that guy in the photo,
he's probably our killer.

334
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:59,250
So, how was your lunch?
Oh, I loved the special.

335
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,950
I'll bet. Wait a minute.

336
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,310
Can you blow up this one section?
Yeah, sure.

337
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,330
Rounded and gold? It's a plaque.
It's the British seal.

338
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:12,380
This picture was taken right outside the British consulate.
Pull up a list of the consulate employees.

339
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,770
Here you go.

340
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,310
Well, he's not on this page.

341
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:23,550
There he is.
Nigel Wyndham.

342
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,600
Deputy general of the British consulate.

343
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,830
Which means he's just under the consulate general in rank,

344
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:31,380
so he's responsible for the daily operations
in financial and logistical matters.

345
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,880
What the hell was Naomi doing mixed up with this guy?

346
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,480
That was my mate at Scotland Yard.

347
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,170
He found out some intriguing details on Nigel Wyndham,

348
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:42,200
like the fact that a girlfriend in college died rather mysteriously

349
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,520
while they were on holiday in Rome.

350
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,740
Well, was he ever charged?

351
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:49,580
No, and after that, he had a string of bad investments
until he married Cynthia wadlow.

352
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,530
It was her prominent family
who pulled strings that got him a position,

353
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:53,650
first at the ministry of culture,

354
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,510
and then here at the consulate. - Yo.

355
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:59,590
So we've been reconstructing Naomi's movements
since she landed in New York a couple of weeks ago.

356
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,290
Her financials indicate
that she booked a car service last week

357
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,770
that dropped her at nobu...

358
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:07,130
Now we showed the host Nigel's picture,
and he confirmed that they met for dinner.

359
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,520
Did the host notice anything?

360
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:12,050
Yeah, he noticed the C-Note that Nigel dropped
to secure the romantic table in the back.

361
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,700
I just called the consulate.

362
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,790
The day after the romantic nobu dinner,

363
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:20,230
security removed Naomi from Nigel's office.

364
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,820
Well, it sounds like a fight.

365
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:25,850
Uh, security heard Naomi yell something about Cynthia
as they escorted her out.

366
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,670
Well, it makes perfect sense.

367
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,430
Stuck in a marriage of convenience,

368
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:33,470
Nigel meets the young and beautiful Naomi,

369
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:36,060
finds her irresistible.

370
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:39,390
A chance meeting turns to dinner, dinner to a tryst,

371
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,180
but then Naomi wants more.

372
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,220
Nigel realizes that his affair has become a threat

373
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,850
to his position, his reputation, to the life he built

374
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,640
on the backs of his wife and her family.

375
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:52,270
Sir, if Nigel's wife found out about an affair,

376
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:55,300
it would kill his marriage and his career.

377
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:59,640
Detective Inspector Hunt,
I take your silence to mean that you don't agree?

378
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:03,720
Well, the Naomi I knew
would never fall for someone like Wyndham,

379
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,980
but she wouldn't have left his picture in that locker
if he weren't connected to her death somehow.

380
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:10,790
Nigel Wyndham's position at the consulate includes diplomatic immunity.

381
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:14,060
Which would be waived if he was a suspect in a murder case.

382
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,310
If I pick up the phone to make that request,

383
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,890
I'm gonna need something more concrete than just a theory.

384
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:22,590
Sir, Lanie pulled our killer's prints
off of our victim's neck.

385
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:26,750
And given everything that we know right now,
I am willing to bet that they're a match to Nigel's.

386
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,420
A bet's not enough.

387
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:32,400
But if you can get those prints,
then this is a whole different conversation.

388
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,260
Here's the problem, bro...

389
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,110
foreign dignitaries don't register their fingerprints
with local law enforcement.

390
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:46,640
And if we put in a request to the consulate, they'll box us out

391
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,290
and alert Nigel that he's a suspect.

392
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:52,740
Yeah, I thought Scotland Yard would be able to get them.
Even with his connections across the pond, we struck out.

393
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:59,050
Okay, boys. Here it is.
Here's what?

394
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,020
My foolproof plan for getting Nigel's fingerprint.

395
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,990
Nigel lives in a high-rise apartment
here on Park avenue.

396
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:09,400
Yeah. High security.
Exactly. Ryan, you'll be here...

397
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,020
Front door... dressed as a flower delivery boy.

398
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,060
Esposito, you'll be here dressed as a hobo.

399
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,620
Question.
Why's the brown man gotta be a hobo?

400
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,110
You want the flowers?
Hobo it is.

401
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:24,750
You boys will cause a distraction here
whilst I rappel down the side of the building

402
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,640
with Nicolai. - Who's Nicolai?

403
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,610
He's a Romanian gymnast I found on Youtube.

404
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:32,690
He's extremely flexible and fits in the duffel bag.
Using a glass cutter...

405
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:33,970
Excuse me, gents. - I can...

406
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,450
Has anyone seen detective Beckett?

407
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:48,980
Uh, you guys going out?

408
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:52,410
I pulled some strings and got us into a party
at the British consulate tonight.

409
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,660
Nigel will be there.
We'll get his prints, and he won't even know it.

410
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,090
Cheers, lads.
Cheers.

411
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,320
Or they could do that.

412
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,220
Yeah, sure,

413
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,050
if you want to do it the easy way.

414
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,630
Thank you.

415
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,660
So who is sir Alfred Heath?
Tonight, I am.

416
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:26,490
The lads back home said the real sir Alfred
is down as a no-show.

417
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,070
Gout or some damn thing.

418
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:31,120
Yeah, but what if Nigel Wyndham doesn't show either?
He'll be here.

419
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,230
And I expect he'll skip the champagne
and drink something posh and pretentious,

420
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,710
leaving his print on the glass.

421
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,720
Well, what if he doesn't drink?
He's British.

422
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,400
Trust me, he drinks.
May I?

423
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,610
I didn't realize that dancing was a part of the plan.

424
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,070
Oh, well...

425
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,400
It offers a perfect vantage point.

426
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:03,560
Do you come to a lot of these events?
No, thank God. Why?

427
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,930
You just seem very confident.

428
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:10,720
Well, that's because my companion
is the most beautiful woman in this room.

429
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,040
That's clearly the champagne talking.

430
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,330
I'm sure you're just comfortable here because you're amongst your own people.

431
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:24,000
These aren't my people.
My people are the ones carrying the trays.

432
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,100
Yeah.
I grew up on the East End.

433
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,860
My mom cleaned flats. Dad worked in a factory.

434
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,520
They wanted something better, they just...

435
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,600
They couldn't quite get it.
And then?

436
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,540
I was admitted to Eton on a scholarship

437
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,210
where I minored in blending in.

438
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,000
Oh. - What about you?

439
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:46,740
I grew up in the city

440
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,320
and, uh, went to college in California.

441
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,060
Well, you could obviously do anything
you put your mind to.

442
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:55,380
Why be a cop?
I guess it was just my calling.

443
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,800
Ah, a crusader.
I know the type.

444
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,250
Doesn't leave a lot of time for personal life, though, does it?

445
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:08,990
What about you? Are you the crusader type as well?
Married to the bit, I'm afraid.

446
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,970
The job comes first.
Though sometimes, I wish it didn't.

447
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,580
Yeah. I know the feeling.

448
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:25,700
Wait a minute. Look over there by the bar.
My 1:00.

449
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,400
Let the games begin.

450
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,670
All right. Take care.

451
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,640
Good evening.

452
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,620
Nigel Wyndham. Deputy general.

453
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,630
Jean Harrington.
Bored.

454
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,780
Well, we'll have to remedy that, Ms. Harrington.
Uh, one for the lady, please.

455
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,180
Oh, a ring. That's discouraging.

456
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,680
Oh, well, it needn't be.

457
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,690
To new friendships.

458
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,950
Now tell me, Ms. Harrington, are you here alone?

459
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:22,300
If so, it would be a grave injustice.

460
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,540
My date's more interested in networking than he is in me.

461
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:29,350
In that case, he won't object
if I ask you for a dance.

462
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,810
You know what?

463
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,740
I wouldn't care even if he did.

464
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,800
Shall we?
Mm-hmm.

465
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,780
So... tell me, Ms. Harrington,

466
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,090
what should I know about you?

467
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,980
Well, there's more to me than meets the eye.

468
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,640
Well, what meets the eye

469
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,880
is irresistible.

470
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,940
You know, actions speak louder than words.

471
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:11,030
Meaning?
Meaning, if I'm so irresistible,

472
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,070
then why aren't you using both your hands?

473
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,110
Excuse me, your excellency.

474
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:31,920
Oh, excuse me. Pardon me.
Coming through. Oh.

475
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,690
Sorry, sir. As you were. - Very rude!

476
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:37,920
Excuse me. Oh. - Oh!

477
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,840
Excuse me.

478
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:43,800
Sir Alfred Heath?
Yes.

479
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:47,950
Might I have a word, sir?
There seems to be two of you here this evening.

480
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,610
Sorry.

481
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,060
All right. Let's try this way.

482
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,500
I- I have to ask,

483
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,680
are you as aggressive in your other activities

484
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,320
as you are on the dance floor?

485
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,160
Ah, you know, what can I say?

486
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:10,360
I like to lead... all the time.

487
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,820
Well, there's obviously been a serious mistake.

488
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,350
I am the real sir Alfred,
so if there's somebody else, uh, here as sir Alfred,

489
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,300
then they're obviously, uh, an imposter.

490
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,620
Uh, you have any I.D.?

491
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,360
Uh, I-I actually don't have any. - Are you...

492
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,120
no, no, I've left my, um... - Is... is everything all right?

493
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,980
Um, yeah. You know, I'm suddenly...

494
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,080
I feel very hungry. Excuse me.

495
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,200
Would you like one of these? I hear they're great.

496
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,980
I'm not a caviar man myself.

497
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:36,170
Yeah, but I hear they're an aphrodisiac.
Mm. Not for me, I'm afraid.

498
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,220
I'm sorry to intrude, Mr. Wyndham, sir.
Yes, what is it, Bryson?

499
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:44,520
Uh, the young lady, I need her to come with me.
Well, for what purpose?

500
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:48,950
Don't worry, darling.
I know that we'll see each other again very soon.

501
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:56,990
I had the waiter, then I lost him.

502
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,540
I've bollixed up the whole plan,
and now we've got nothing.

503
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:03,430
Oh, I wouldn't say nothing.
I swiped Wyndham's card case.

504
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:07,260
It's got his prints all over it.
You sneaky little thief.

505
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,910
That's bloody brilliant.

506
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:11,160
Thank you. Now let's go get this son of a bitch.

507
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:15,660
The print's not a match.
What?

508
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:18,460
C.S.U. ran the fingerprints off the card case,

509
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,750
compared 'em to the one that Lanie found on Naomi's body.

510
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,970
It wasn't Nigel Wyndham's.
No, that's not possible. Run it again.

511
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,370
Ryan already did that three times.
Wyndham's not our killer.

512
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:29,330
He's behind this. I know it.
It's why Naomi left us his photograph.

513
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:32,730
Well, maybe he hired someone to do his dirty work for him.
Like one of his security men.

514
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,470
Can you get Scotland Yard to run background checks
on the security staff?

515
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:39,200
<i>Or a better path might be to look into this mysterious number</i>

516
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,960
that Naomi wrote on the back of that photo, which is a mystery no longer.

517
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,890
Is this lobster, bro?
Lucky for you, Jacinda's a light eater.

518
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:50,090
You heat that up, little bit of melted butter...
Are you telling us you know what that number means? How?

519
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:54,020
Well, as Jacinda and I were enjoying
our succulent lobsters from Maine,

520
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,360
paired with an earthy
yet elegant Pinot Noir from sonoma valley...

521
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,250
Castle, numbers.
Right. Well, we were going over the file.

522
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:04,680
Turns out Jacinda's quite a little crime solver.
You showed the stewardess the evidence file?

523
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,660
<i>No.
I took a picture of it with my phone.</i>

524
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:11,840
And the preferred nomenclature is "flight attendant. "

525
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,410
The point is, this code refers to
a diplomatic pouch.

526
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:18,300
How do you know that?
Jacinda recognized the format.

527
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:23,100
Furthermore, she told me these last three digits
are a reference code for royal eastern airlines.

528
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,200
Which means the pouch was delivered on that airline.

529
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,890
Exactly. The "W4" refers to the size of the pouch,

530
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:31,360
the "1949" indicates exactly which pouch it is

531
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,400
in the consulate sequence.

532
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,300
As the deputy general, Nigel signs for all the pouches.

533
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,750
So then maybe this wasn't about an affair gone wrong
between Nigel and Naomi.

534
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,550
It's about smuggling. - Well, that makes a lot of sense.

535
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,850
Diplomatic pouches are sealed and their contents

536
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,500
bypass T.S.A. and customs inspections.

537
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,710
Naomi must have got on to what Wyndham was doing somehow.
We need to know what was in that pouch.

538
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:51,800
The consulate's never gonna release that information.
Oh, we don't have to worry about the consulate.

539
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,710
The airline keeps a copy of the waybill.

540
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,690
Get ahold of the airline. Let's get that waybill down here.

541
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,830
Ryan, grab a pen.

542
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,130
What?

543
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,560
Castle, you can't just share

544
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,700
confidential police information with an outsider.

545
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,120
Even if it solves the case?

546
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,510
I mean, she gave us a lead.

547
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,230
That's more than you got at the consulate.

548
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:26,130
And that's supposed to make this all okay?

549
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:28,320
Jacinda just wanted to help. What's the big deal?

550
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,580
You don't get it, do you?
No, I guess I don't.

551
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:34,430
No, I gu... I guess you don't.
We found something you're gonna want to see.

552
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,200
The airline e-mailed over the waybill.

553
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:46,780
The pouch that matches our number
was shipped from the British consulate about a year ago.

554
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,790
It flew from J.F.K.

555
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,110
To Kampala, Uganda.

556
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:54,530
Uganda? That can't be a coincidence.
What do you mean?

557
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:57,730
Naomi's boyfriend, the one who died, he was killed in Uganda.

558
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,650
Any idea of what was being shipped?
Uh, just that it weighed 200 pounds.

559
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,630
Well, that's awfully heavy for a pouch.

560
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:07,490
Well, a diplomatic pouch can be as small as an envelope
or as big as a cargo container.

561
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:10,460
Whatever's being shipped, it's being sent out
about once a month.

562
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:13,320
I just combed through airline waybills from the past year.

563
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,880
Ten other pouches, all the same weight,
were flown from here to Uganda.

564
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,520
In fact, one of them is listed as being in J.F.K.'s secure baggage area.

565
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:23,680
You mean to say, one of those pouches
is at the airport right now?

566
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:26,760
Finding out what's in that pouch could tell us who killed Naomi.

567
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,920
Yeah, but we don't have any jurisdiction here, Castle.

568
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,500
If the NYPD tries to open up a British diplomatic pouch,

569
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,190
we could risk an international incident.

570
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,500
Then it's a good thing I'm not NYPD.

571
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:48,690
Good evening, sir.
I'm agent Bauer with Homeland Security.

572
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:52,810
I'm here for the inspection.
Nobody radioed me about any inspection.

573
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:56,430
Well, of course they didn't.
We conduct random checks to assess security.

574
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,240
Telling you we were coming kind of defeats the purpose.

575
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,530
Am I right? We'd be tipping our hand,
showing our play book, so to speak.

576
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:04,070
Two years, I've worked this shift,
and I've never heard of anything...

577
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:07,510
Look, Morgan, is it? I'm sure you run a tight ship here.
So if things inside are secure,

578
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:11,560
I'll make damn sure your bosses know about it,
which will reflect well on you.

579
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,950
We're all on the same team here, pal.

580
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:16,430
I gotta verify this with my supervisor.

581
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,180
Yeah, you do that.

582
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,930
I'm getting more adept
at faking my way past people.

583
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,550
Must be all the practice.

584
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,710
You're in the baggage area?
Yeah, but I don't have much time.

585
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:33,140
Maybe a minute before the guy calls his supervisor
- to check my story.

586
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:37,650
- All right, so based on the shipping code, the pouch that you're looking for
is about 5 feet long.

587
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:41,530
Does the waybill say
if it's a crate, a footlocker, cardboard box, what?

588
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:45,780
No, sorry, bro.
But it's 200 pounds, so it's gotta be something sturdy.

589
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:47,880
Something sturdy. Right.

590
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,240
Oh, come on.

591
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,490
Here we go. I found it. It's a crate.
Agent Bauer!

592
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:59,350
I need you to step outta there, please.
Okay, that didn't sound good.

593
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:02,360
Agent Bauer... What did he expect?
I heard that.

594
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:06,950
Uh, I've just about wrapped up here.
Sir, my supervisor will be here...

595
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:11,210
And he will be mighty pleased with your work, Morgan,
mighty pleased.

596
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:13,020
It's clear to me that you've been working harder than a...

597
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,310
One-legged man in an ass-kicking contest.

598
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:19,080
Step outta there now, sir. I will not tell you again.

599
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:24,100
Hello!
You there? Hello!

600
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:28,100
Bloody hell.
What's in the crate?

601
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,400
Missiles.

602
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,550
Stinger Missile

603
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,790
Customs and Homeland Security have impounded the crate,

604
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:41,650
and Interpol is on their way to J.F.K.

605
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:43,690
How did you explain opening the diplomatic pouch?

606
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:48,040
Well, everyone's more interested in the missiles at the moment,
but I expect I'll be in hot water at some point.

607
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,040
And where does this leave Wyndham?
Untouched.

608
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,230
What do you mean untouched? He was smuggling weapons.

609
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:56,310
Well, they'll have an inquiry, of course,
but they can't prove he knew what was in the crate.

610
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:59,530
And since we opened the crate illegally,
we won't be able to use it as evidence.

611
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:03,860
At least it all starts to make sense now.
Naomi was trying to solve Aiden's murder.

612
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:07,080
That would be Naomi's boyfriend... Aiden Miller.

613
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,140
He worked for doctors without borders in Uganda

614
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,470
until his helicopter was shot down
by guerilla forces a year ago.

615
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,200
The British government launched an investigation,

616
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,350
but was never able to determine how the rebels acquired
a stinger missile.

617
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:20,190
Which we now know came to them
courtesy of Nigel Wyndham.

618
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,760
Yeah, except Nigel's not the type

619
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,350
to get his hands dirty when it comes to missiles or murder.

620
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,170
He must have had a partner
who had a line on those stingers.

621
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:31,020
And if Naomi started looking into the smuggling operation...

622
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,180
Then perhaps it was the partner who got rid of her.

623
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:35,820
So then the question is, who is this partner?

624
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:39,630
Everything Naomi did was about finding out
who supplied the weapon that killed her boyfriend.

625
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,290
That's why she stopped taking modeling gigs.

626
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:43,340
That's why she came to New York. It's...

627
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:48,680
Maybe there's someone on that list of attendees
for that, uh, foreign dignitary party.

628
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:51,670
I mean, it all started when she booked that out of London
a few months ago.

629
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,210
Paulo Makuzi.
And who is he?

630
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:57,630
A leader of the rebel army in Uganda.
Naomi must have heard something at the party.

631
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,160
That's what led her to the consulate.

632
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,720
And that romantic dinner with Nigel was just part of her agenda
to get the pouch number from his office.

633
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,820
So then there's just one piece

634
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,930
that doesn't fit in her investigation.

635
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,910
What was she doing with Biggie Slim?

636
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,780
I want you to take a close look at this photo.

637
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:17,480
Yeah, I seen this one.

638
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,570
Paparazzi caught me and Nicky Jay
coming out of the studio a couple weeks ago.

639
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:23,660
In fact, that is Nicky Jay's black S.U.V., isn't it?

640
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,640
Bought by Biggie Slim himself. - Mm.

641
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,750
Supply and demand. She demands, I gotta supply.

642
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:32,530
You know, the thing that I find intriguing
is that before you became Biggie Slim,

643
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:37,130
you're name was Darius Young,
best known for launching several failed Internet start-ups.

644
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:41,530
Just a man ahead of my time.
Well, the S.E.C. thought you were a man trying to fleece investors.

645
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:44,420
See, I was never charged for that.
One of your ventures,

646
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:48,340
a music sharing web site based in the U.K.,
caught the attention of British authorities.

647
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,700
And when they tried to shut it down,

648
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:53,270
an aide to the minister of culture
lobbied on your behalf.

649
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:56,780
And do you know who that aide was?
Nigel Wyndham.

650
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,980
In fact, this is Nigel

651
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,730
stepping out of the very same black S.U.V.

652
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,420
No, I don't think so.
Why don't you take a closer look?

653
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:13,180
It's got the same custom pinstripes on the door.
It's just somebody else's truck with those stripes on there.

654
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:16,610
Your driver already admitted that he drove you to this meeting outside the consulate.

655
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:19,730
We also know that your cousin is in the service... Drew Harris.

656
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,740
A staff sergeant. He works at an armory.
He supplied the missiles.

657
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:26,830
You knew that Wyndham had access
to the diplomatic pouch, and you saw an opportunity.

658
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:30,520
Supply and demand.
That's a whole lot of speculation there, mate.

659
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:35,460
Well, we weren't the only ones to put together the pieces.
Naomi wasn't giving you her phone number.

660
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,720
She was looking for evidence.

661
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,900
Once you realized that she was the same girl
that Wyndham caught snooping,

662
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,790
you followed her to the motel and you killed her.

663
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:49,140
Well, how y'all gon' prove that?
A partial fingerprint on Naomi's body...

664
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,810
And it's a match to you.

665
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,710
You know, the thing
that I still can't figure out is, why Uganda?

666
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,880
Why would you care?

667
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,120
Man, it wasn't about Uganda.

668
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,690
It was just about the money.

669
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:17,090
I didn't even know where Wyndham was shipping the stuff to.

670
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:27,190
Good. Uh, call my assistant.
I am, uh, wide open all week.

671
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,900
Actually, you're not.
Or the following week, for that matter.

672
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,180
Told you I'd see you soon.
What is this?

673
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:35,850
Getting thrown out of here once already wasn't enough for you people?
Security.

674
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:39,750
They can't help you, mate. Nobody can.
Not even your well-funded ugandan friends.

675
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:40,910
Nigel Wyndham...

676
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:43,330
You're under arrest for international arms trafficking

677
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:45,650
and for abetting in the murder of a British citizen.

678
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,200
Her dad would've been proud...

679
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,250
How brave she was, taking on these men.

680
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,060
But I so wish she hadn't done it.

681
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,500
So what happens now? Do you go back to D.C.?

682
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,320
London, I'm afraid.
Face the music.

683
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,590
You know, they should give you a commendation.

684
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,260
Well, that is wildly improbable.

685
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:20,490
Well, detective Beckett,
it's been a true pleasure.

686
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:24,180
The pleasure was all mine, Detective Inspector Hunt.

687
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,010
Please. Colin.

688
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:32,640
Kate.
You know, I have a few hours before my flight, Kate.

689
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,800
Could I persuade you to let me buy you a drink?

690
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:47,670
I'm sorry. I have a bit of paperwork to do.

691
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,100
Another time.

692
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,970
Where's Scotland Yard off to?
Oh, he's going back to London.

693
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:02,980
Um... Castle, do you have a second?
Can we talk...

694
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:05,960
Actually, I don't. Jacinda has the Ferrari double parked in a loading zone.

695
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,800
Four dates in three days. You like her.

696
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,030
Yeah. Why?

697
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,380
Uh, she just... she doesn't seem like your type.

698
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,660
Well, she's fun and uncomplicated.

699
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,330
I think that's what my life needs right now.

700
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,230
Hi. It's, uh, it's Kate.

701
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,350
Do you still want to buy me that drink?

702
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:56,770
