00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,250
你真美  妮基・希特
You are very beautiful, Nikki Heat.

10
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,850
只可惜我现在得杀了你
It is too bad that I have to kill you now.

11
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,260
比你更丑的男人都试过  德拉格
Uglier men than you have tried, Drago.

12
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,910
你扇我巴掌
You have slapped me.

13
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:51,850
我不会
I will not have--

14
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,660
玩洋娃娃呢
Playing with dolls, are we?

15
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,000
这些是人形公仔
These are action figures.

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,960
我借他们来创作场景
I am using them to envision a scene.

17
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,370
我还欠编辑几章《冰冻之心》
I owe a few chapters of "Frozen Heat" to my editor,

18
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,810
但我一页都写不出
and I've not been able to write a page.

19
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,140
也许和贝克特办件案子
Maybe a case with Beckett might,

20
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,010
就能激发灵感呢
you know, spark something.

21
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,230
她在准备庭审
She's prepping for a trial.

22
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:08,680
是信件吗
That the mail?

23
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,800
对  谢天谢地阿丽克西斯
Oh, yeah, yeah. Thank God Alexis is

24
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,850
终于收到一些大学的回信了
finally getting some college acceptance letters.

25
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,120
她的朋友们几周前就陆陆续续收到了
Her friends started getting them weeks ago.

26
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:19,490
理查德・卡塞尔
Richard Castle,

27
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,020
你到底在玩什么把戏
what on earth are you playing at?

28
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,500
我不想让阿丽克西斯再经历
I don't want Alexis to have to live through

29
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,160
收到斯坦福大学拒信的噩梦了
that Stanford rejection nightmare again.

30
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,720
所以我要藏着这些信
So I'm holding the letters.

31
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,970
这样一来  她一下子收齐这些信
This way, she gets them all at once,

32
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,380
有坏消息的同时也有好消息
and she'll get all the good news with the bad.

33
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,670
理查德  这是你有史以来最蠢的主意了
Richard, that is the dumbest idea you've ever had.

34
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,070
你得在她神经崩溃前
Now you've got to give her these letters

35
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,020
把这些信给她
before she has a nervous breakdown.

36
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,760
好啦  我会的
Okay, I will. I will.

37
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:40,760
不过你得承认
Though you have to admit,

38
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,250
看她神经崩溃挺有趣的
watching her have a nervous breakdown is pretty funny.

39
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,240
我才不这么认为呢
Unlike yours.

40
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,240
你的写作怎么办
Now what are we gonna do about your writing?

41
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,380
不知道  我就是需要些  不同以往的东西
Oh, I don't know. I just need something... different,

42
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,420
新东西
something new,

43
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,550
比如说
something like...

44
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,010
头条新闻
发现人头

45
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,110
人头
severed heads.

46
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,900
人头
Severed heads?

47
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,800
死者是在午夜之后被人枪杀的
The victim was found shot to death after midnight.

48
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,480
据警方称  他的包里装了三个人头
According to police, his bag contained three severed heads.

49
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,550
斯勒特警探  你能说说
Detective Slaughter, what can you tell us about--

50
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,940
趁我没开枪打爆你的摄像机  给我拿开
Get that camera out of my face before I put a bullet in it!

51
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,390
妈
Oh-ho, Mother,

52
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,850
忘了人头吧
forget severed heads.

53
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,320
我想去认识这个人
I want to meet that guy.

54
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,410
亲爱的  你已经有缪斯了
You already have a Muse, darling.

55
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,770
没错  缪斯是用来激发灵感的
Yes, well, Muses are to provide inspiration,

56
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,680
但现在我完全没有受到激发
and right now I ain't getting any.

57
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,680
妮基・希特警探
So Detective Nikki Heat,

58
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,690
来认识一下斯勒特警探吧
meet Detective Slaughter.

59
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,940
把这东西放在会议室
You know what? Park that in the conference room.

60
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:28,680
谢谢
Thank you.

61
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,420
卡塞尔  你来干嘛啊
Hey. Castle, what are you doing here?

62
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,830
就是几天没见你了
I just haven't seen you in a few days.

63
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,410
我觉得应该过来看看你怎么样了
Thought I'd drop by, see how you're doing.

64
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,730
谢谢  真贴心
Thank you. That's so sweet.

65
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,480
事实上我很好
Um, I'm great, actually.

66
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,680
庭审准备得很好
The trial prep is going really well.

67
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,770
我能准时下班回家
I've been getting home at a decent hour, and...

68
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,590
见到你很高兴
It's great to see you.

69
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,750
我也是
It's good to see you, too.

70
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,350
关于那个叫斯勒特的黑帮组警探
Hey, listen, do you know anything about

71
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,330
你都知道些什么
this gang cop named Slaughter?

72
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,800
人头凶案  你就是为此来的
The severed-heads homicide, that's why you're here?

73
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,360
不是
Uh, no. I mean,

74
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,220
只不过既然你忙着准备庭审
just, since you're busy prepping for the trial,

75
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,120
我就是想查查这个斯勒特的底
I just thought I'd look into this Slaughter guy,

76
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,510
大致了解一下这人  做为背景调查
get a sense of who he is for the background research,

77
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,060
就是  那个
the-- the...

78
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:04,930
除非你对此有问题
Unless that's a problem.

79
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,440
不  没问题
No, not a problem.

80
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,000
太好了  那我能在哪找到他呢
Great. So where would I find him?

81
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,970
尸体在哪就去哪呗
Wherever the body is.

82
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,020
亲爱的  你还是承认吧
Darlin', you might as well confess.

83
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,260
我知道是你杀了他
I know you killed him

84
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,200
以便你我共度美好时光
so we could spend some quality time together.

85
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,740
即使你是地球上最后一个男人我也不会勾搭你
Not if you were the last man on earth.

86
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,540
别以为我会知难而退
Don't think I'm not up to the challenge.

87
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,440
不如跳过你的大男子幻想
How about we skip the macho fantasy,

88
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,750
我直接告诉你死因吧
and I just tell you cause of death?

89
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,190
让我猜猜  中弹而亡
Let me guess-- lead poisoning?

90
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,510
胸口三枪
Three shots to the chest.

91
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,880
最有可能是短时间内大量失血而死
Most likely died of blood loss within minutes.

92
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,090
我就知道格林奇终会躺在这儿
Always figured Glitch would end up on this table.

93
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,250
格林奇是他的绰号  因为他做事一团糟
Glitch-- it's his street name on account, he's such a screwup.

94
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,510
你帮我把子弹拿出来了吗
You fish the slugs out for me?

95
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,050
看见没  你果然爱我
Ah. See? You do love me.

96
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,870
我猜是点32的吧
.32s, I'm guessing.

97
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,750
-你在说子弹对吧  -没错
- You're talking about the bullets, right? - Yeah.

98
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,340
你不问人头的事了吗
Aren't you gonna ask about the heads?

99
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,310
-你是谁  -这位是卡塞尔
- Who the hell are you? - That's Castle.

100
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,500
他是作家  12分局的顾问
He's a writer, and he consults with the 12th.

101
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,590
好奇怪  这些头都不新鲜
It's weird. You can tell they aren't fresh.

102
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,890
能闻出来  甲醛  还带有些许腐臭
You can smell it-- formaldehyde with a soupcon of decay.

103
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,020
从头发里的泥土看来
Judging from the dirt in the hair,

104
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,790
应该是死者挖出了尸体
I'd say our victim dug the bodies up

105
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,790
然后砍下了他们的头
and then cut the heads off.

106
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,260
真厉害啊  夏洛克
No kidding, Sherlock.

107
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,140
我早派人去查看本地墓园了
I already got UNIS checking out the local cemeteries,

108
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,870
不过那也与你无关
not that it's any of your business.

109
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,500
里克・卡塞尔  正如劳拉所说
Rick Castle, and like Laura said,

110
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,020
我和12分局的贝克特探长合作
I work out of the 1-2 with Detective Beckett.

111
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:20,650
是这样的
Here's the thing--

112
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,700
我希望能跟着你办这件案子
I was hoping I could ride along with you on this one,

113
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,210
就一两天
just for a day or two.

114
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,300
-不行  -不行
- No. - No?

115
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,690
我不需要有个作家在边上闲晃
I need a writer hanging around

116
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:28,780
就像我不需要梅毒一样
like I need a case of the crabs.

117
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:29,750
真是
That's...

118
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,580
我要如何让你改变心意
What could I say to change your mind?

119
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,930
这件外套不错
Well, that is a very fine coat.

120
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,480
你穿上会很好看
And it would look fabulous on you.

121
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,270
成交了吗
So are we good?

122
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:53,590
不
No.

123
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:54,990
再见了  美人
See ya, gorgeous.

124
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,880
你说我给你外套的话就能跟着你的
You said I could ride along if I gave you my coat.

125
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:00,950
我可没说过
I never said that.

126
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,020
你暗示了
It was implied.

127
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,180
我一个人办案
Look, I work alone.

128
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,740
你说什么都不会改变这一点的
Nothing you say is gonna change that.

129
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,710
我是市长的朋友
I'm friends with the mayor.

130
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:09,400
什么
Yeah?

131
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,710
既然我这算是求你帮忙
And seeing as how I'm asking you for a favor here,

132
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,440
那我就欠你一个人情
that would mean I would owe you one in return.

133
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,800
市长的朋友就是我的朋友
Well, any friend of the mayor is a friend of mine.

134
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,720
我们第一步做什么
What's our first move?

135
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,440
告诉格林奇爸爸他儿子的死讯
Break the news to Glitch's dad.

136
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,810
真给力  贝克特绝不会把车开上人行道
That was awesome. Beckett never drives on the sidewalk.

137
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,820
你要是想跟我混
If you're gonna hang with me,

138
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,150
就得知道些基本规矩
we're gonna lay out some ground rules.

139
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,010
第一条规矩
Rule number one,

140
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,700
不准说"给力"
do not use the word "Awesome."

141
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,810
你是个成年人了
You're a grown man.

142
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,180
第二条规矩  别给我惹麻烦
Rule number two, stay outta my way.

143
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:38,460
就这些
Is that it?

144
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,960
差不多都概括了
That's kinda all-encompassing.

145
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,210
做这工作最艰难的就是
This is the hardest part of the job--

146
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,680
通知家人死讯
breaking the news to the family.

147
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,790
你是什么风格  寥寥数语却深表同情
So what's your style, terse yet compassionate,

148
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,090
-用词小心但底气十足  -布莱恩
- sensitive but strong? - Brian.

149
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,820
格林奇正躺在停尸房
Glitch is in the morgue.

150
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,540
有人给他吃了三颗子弹
Someone pumped three rounds into him.

151
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,610
节哀顺变
We're sorry for your loss.

152
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,290
什么  节哀
My what? My "Loss"?

153
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,860
你他妈是谁  跟我说节哀
Who the hell are you to talk about my loss?

154
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,790
你那小子卷进了个不同一般的大麻烦
Your boy was into something bad, worse than usual.

155
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,010
你知道是什么情况吗
What do you know about it?

156
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,300
就算知道也没必要告诉你
And why would I tell ya even if I knew?

157
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,910
有尸体被砍下了头
Well, it involved cutting the heads off of dead guys.

158
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,910
你小子不像是会做这种傻事的人
Doesn't sound like your boy's brand of stupid.

159
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,030
我的儿子
My son...

160
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,130
是身处乱世的单纯少年
was a simple lad operating in difficult times.

161
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,180
瞧不起他  你后果自负
You disparage his memory at your peril.

162
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,210
现在
Now...

163
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,800
我得去通知他的妈妈  安排后事
I've gotta go tell his mom, make arrangements.

164
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,650
这人不好对付
That's a hard man.

165
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,350
心慈手软可做不了西部帮派的头号人物
You don't get to be top leg breaker in the Westies by being soft.

166
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,480
难怪他没透露点风声
No wonder he didn't give us anything useful.

167
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,340
我也没抱希望
Never thought he would.

168
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,150
他是那种喜欢"私设公堂"的人
He's a "Take the law into your own hands" Kinda guy.

169
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,340
你是说他会自己解决杀死格林奇的人
You think he's gonna hunt down Glitch's killer himself.

170
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,930
没错  我们得跟着他
Yeah, and we're gonna follow him.

171
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,940
关键在于赶在他杀人之前出面调停
The tricky part's gonna be interceding before he kills the guy.

172
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,540
走  他已经上路了
Let's go. He's on the move.

173
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:54,860
你觉得他会去哪
where do you think he's going?

174
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,000
要知道就不用跟着他了
I don't know. That's why we're following him.

175
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,210
喂
Yeah?

176
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,310
好样的
Outstanding.

177
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,040
警员发现了格林奇拿到人头的那个公墓
Unis found the cemetery where Glitch got the heads.

178
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,470
距离犯罪现场四个街区
Four blocks from the crime scene.

179
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:11,800
多谢了  老兄
Thanks, brother.

180
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,270
等回到办公室去查到这些人
Back to the office, run these names down,

181
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,850
看是谁的脑袋
find out who these heads belong to.

182
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,430
不用等  我的团队现在就能查
Why wait when I can have my team run them right now?

183
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,440
你有团队
you got a team?

184
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,930
-你好  -我给你发了三个名字
- Hello? - I am texting you three names,

185
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,080
都是刚死不久的人
all recently deceased.

186
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,180
需要你帮我查查
I need you to run 'em for me.

187
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,710
贝克特现在手头没有案子
Beckett's not working a case right now.

188
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,480
不  我和黑帮组的斯勒特办案呢
No, I'm running and gunning with Slaughter from gangs.

189
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,590
那就叫他自己查
Then have him run the names.

190
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,090
我不是你手下的人
I don't work for you.

191
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:36,770
埃斯波西托
Ah, Esposito,

192
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:37,860
你太幽默了
You are too funny.

193
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,320
他在你旁边  是吧
He's there, isn't he?

194
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,530
好吧
All right.

195
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,100
你想让我帮你撑门面  就要付出代价
If you want me to make you look good, it's gonna cost.

196
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,500
尼克斯队的前排座位
Front-row knicks tickets.

197
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,750
很好
Sounds good.

198
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,510
再顺便说一句
Oh, and, uh, by the way,

199
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,390
你的搭档斯勒特
your boy Slaughter--

200
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,400
在黑帮组可是大名鼎鼎
he's got quite a reputation in gangs.

201
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,050
外号是"天煞孤星"
His nickname is "The widowmaker."

202
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,030
他的前三个搭档都死了
His last three partners were all killed

203
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,160
因公殉职

204
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,490
-还好吗  -嗯
- All good? - Yeah.

205
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,720
你觉得他们之中有人是杀手
You think one of those guys could be the killer?

206
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:11,570
不  他只是在打探消息
Nah, he's just trolling for info,

207
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,330
我们只要
which means we watch

208
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,020
等着瞧
and wait.

209
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,180
不用了  谢谢
Ahh. Ah, no, thanks.

210
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,120
好吧
Okay, sure.

211
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,610
那么
So...

212
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,800
他们管你叫天煞孤星
they call you the widowmaker.

213
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,590
他们总把傻瓜塞给我  这又不是我的错
Hey, not my fault they keep sticking me with idiots.

214
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,150
说到搭档
Speaking of partners,

215
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,620
我看过你的搭档  她可是热辣滚烫
I've seen pictures of yours. She's smokin' hot.

216
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,080
和她有一腿吗
You're tappin' that, right?

217
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,440
什么  没有
What? No.

218
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,350
没有  你有什么毛病
No? What's wrong with you?

219
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,980
没...没什么毛病
Nothing's--nothing's wrong with me.

220
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,000
我们只是朋友
We're just friends.

221
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,610
男人想要朋友  买条狗就行了
Man needs a friend, he gets a dog.

222
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,700
那样的女人  不能翻云覆雨
Woman like that, you storm the beaches

223
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,950
也得死缠烂打  拜托
or die trying. Come on.

224
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,650
他往那家酒吧走了  该上场了
He's heading for that bar. Showtime.

225
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:01,620
带了枪吗
You packin'?

226
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,900
带枪  我不是警察
Packing? No, I'm not a cop.

227
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,260
我的防弹衣上写着"作家"呢
My vest says "Writer" On it.

228
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,570
第三条规矩  跟我办事就得全副武装
Rule number three, you ride with me, you ride strapped.

229
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:08,590
走吧
Come on.

230
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,730
那不是触犯了相关法规
hey, hey, what about regulations?

231
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,080
你不是签了弃权证书吗
You signed a waiver, didn't you?

232
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,390
你走前门  我走后门
Okay, you take the front, I'll go in the back.

233
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,300
等等  等等  我们该叫上后援吧
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Shouldn't we call for backup?

234
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,230
你还有写着"作家"的裙子吗
You got a skirt that says "Writer" on it, too?

235
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,320
没有

Come on. Give me ten seconds, then go in hard.

237
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,010
大喊纽约警局  越大声越好
Yell out "NYPD," The louder, the better.

238
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,910
纽约警局
N-Y-P-D!

239
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,000
我是相关平民调查员  都不准动
Associated civilian investigator. Nobody move.

240
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,430
-把枪放下  人渣  -你叫我什么
- Drop the gun, dirtbag! - What did you call me?

241
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,800
人...人渣
D-dirtbag.

242
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,390
放下枪  不然你老婆就能在
Drop it or your wife will be getting

243
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,090
殡仪馆买一赠一了

Come on. Set down

245
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:05,510
抓住他  夏洛克
Get him, Sherlock!

246
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:17,910
抓住了
I got him!

247
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,520
要跑了  要跑了
I don't--I don't got him. I don't got him.

248
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,040
要跑了  要跑了
I don't got him. I don't got him.

249
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,280
帮个忙
Little help!

250
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,460
你干的很好
You're doing fine.

251
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,520
好样的  夏洛克  好小子
Well done, Sherlock. Attaboy.

灵

261
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,660
我怎么听说卡塞尔
What's this I hear about Castle

262
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,950
和别的警察一起去查案了
researching with another cop?

263
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,970
你没有文件要填吗
Don't you have some files to fill out?

264
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,950
我相信这只是阶段性而已  你也知道卡塞尔
I'm sure it's just a phase. You know Castle.

265
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,080
他可能是被断头案
He's probably caught up in the severed heads

266
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,040
和帮派啥的迷住了

267
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,890
我才不关心他
I don't care what...

268
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:05,870
他
what...

269
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,080
卷入了什么事  只要他
he's wrapped up in just so long as he...

270
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,310

272
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,270
暂时帮我看管一下
Hey, put him on ice for me, huh?

273
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,700
希亚  肥水不留外人田  知道吗
Shea, keep it in the family, huh?

274
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,820
-审讯室在哪儿  -就在那里  第一扇门
- Where's interrogation? - Right there. First door right there.

275
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,590
你给我过来
Come on, you.

276
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,060
这是怎么回事
What the hell happened?

277
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,880
你真该看到那一幕
Oh, you should have seen it.

278
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,570
斯勒特先发制人  擒住了一个
Slaughter got the drop on the one guy,

279
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,010
可另一个想逃走
but the other guy tried to make a break for it.

280
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,910
我只得把他放倒
I had to take his ass down.

281
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,960
你干了什么  你开玩笑吧
You what? Are you kidding me?

282
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,910
你是个作家  卡塞尔  不是个警察
You're a writer, Castle. Not a cop.

283
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,470
我可以照顾好自己  是你从不给我机会
Hey, I can take care of myself. You just never give me a chance.

284
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,100
当然  因为我不想让你挂掉
Yeah, because I'm not trying to get you killed.

285
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,140
他要用我们的审讯室干什么
And what is he doing using our box?

286
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,340
是我请他来的
Well, I invited him to.

287
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,760
卡塞尔  你没这个资格
Castle, that's not your place.

288
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,240
我想你不会介意的  再说  斯勒特这种人
I didn't think you'd mind. Besides, guys like Slaughter,

289
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,320
他们总是从这个分局跳到那个分局
they just float from precinct to precinct, you know?

290
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,780
就像游牧者
They're like nomads,

291
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,060
在纽约市街头游荡
wandering the streets of New York City,

292
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,380
除暴安良  杀人无赦
kicking ass and taking names,

293
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,440
虽然这句话的本意不是如此
which isn't the most original turn of phrase,

294
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,750
但他真是了不起的人物
but the character is so great.

295
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,290
绝对能为下一本妮基・希特系列带来冲击
It's really gonna help me shake up this next Nikki Heat book.

296
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,310
没问题  只要你能活着把书写下来
Yeah, sure, if you live long enough to actually write about it.

297
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,210
格林奇不是我杀的
I didn't kill Glitch.

298
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,480
那他父亲为什么去找你麻烦
Then why'd his father come after you?

299
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,380
我不知道  可你得说服他我是清白的
I don't know, but you gotta convince him that I'm innocent.

300
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,570
不  不是的
No, no, no, no.

301
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,280
是你得说服我
You gotta convince me

302
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,240
否则我就把你丢进拘留室
or I'm gonna park you in holding

303
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,240
坐山观虎斗
then sit back and marvel

304
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,240
布莱恩如何赤手空拳地
at how Brian removes your limbs

305
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,190
把你四肢拧下来
with his bare hands.

306
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,190
我昨晚在长岛我姐姐家
I was at my sister's house on Long Island last night.

307
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,660
你可以打电话去问她
You can call and ask her.

308
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,860
那为什么布莱恩认为是你杀了他儿子
So why does Brian think you killed his son?

309
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,250
非要这样吗  希亚
Really, Shea?

310
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,110
[美国警探剧]

311
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,110
要我再次上演"帅虎猛龙"的戏码吗
Want me to bust out Jake and the Fatman again?

312
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,620
布莱恩听说我和格林奇起过争执
Brian heard me and Glitch had a falling out,

313
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,430
可我们并没有
but we didn't.

314
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:11,540
那只是
It's just...

315
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,010
芬恩・洛克让我们都离他远点
Finn Rourke told us all to stay away from him.

316
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,080
西部帮派的老大让你们排挤格林奇吗
The head of the Westies made you freeze Glitch out?

317
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:18,750
为什么
Why?

318
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,680
他上周又办砸了一项差事
He screwed up another job last week.

319
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,180
他因为汽油用光  就把一辆满载偷来的
He abandoned a truck full of stolen medical equipment

320
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,290
医疗器材的卡车丢在罗斯福路上了
on the F.D.R. after he ran out of gas.

321
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:31,460
芬恩不杀格林奇的唯一理由就是布莱恩了
The only reason finn didn't have Glitch killed was Brian,

322
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,010
因为他知道如果他儿子出了事
because he knew he was crazy enough

323
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,100
布莱恩是会疯狂到敢去追杀他
to go after him if anything happened to his kid.

324
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,990
为什么格林奇会有一袋子人头
Why did Glitch have a bag full of heads?

325
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,250
不知道
No clue.

326
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,960
你最后一次见到他是什么时候
When's the last time you saw him?

327
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,100
两天以前
Two days ago.

328
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,560
他说他要去干点什么
He said he was gonna do something

329
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,330
跟西部帮派和好
to get back in good with the Westies.

330
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:46,740
他有说是什么事吗
Did he say what it was?

331
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,300
没  我也没问
No, and I didn't ask.

332
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,070
格林奇怎么会觉得砍下死人的头
How could Glitch think that cutting the heads off dead bodies

333
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,620
可以让他跟西部帮派和好呢
would get him back in good with the Westies?

334
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,330
他不是什么有头脑的人
He wasn't a deep thinker.

335
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,290
我可不会费尽心思去找他的动机
I wouldn't knock myself out looking for motive.

336
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,220
卡布奇诺
Cappuccino?

337
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,260
第四条规矩
Rule four.

338
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,250
卡塞尔
Castle.

339
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:06,230
太好了
Perfect.

340
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,930
谢谢  非常感谢
Thank you. Thank you very much.

341
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:10,890
埃斯波西托说
Esposito said

342
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:12,060
你有东西要给他
you'd have something for him.

343
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,030
那个
Uh, that's...

344
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,030
告诉他东西就到
Tell him--tell him they're on their way.

345
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,390
谢了
Thank you.

346
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,260
好了
All right.

347
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,370
看来那些人头的身份查到了
Looks like we got I.D.s on our heads.

348
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,650
三个人都是沟城帮的成员
All three belong to members of the Trench Town Posse.

349
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,750
我靠  谜题解开了
Hot damn. Mystery solved.

350
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,010
沟城帮
Trench Town Posse,

351
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,500
牙买加帮派  掌管着布鲁克林到
Jamaican gang-- runs girls and drugs

352
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,620
布朗克斯的卖淫和毒品交易
from Brooklyn to the Bronx.

353
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,650
他们正和西部帮派为争夺
They're fighting a turf war with the Westies

354
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,760
莫萨高地的地盘而战
over the Morningside Heights.

355
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,190
我猜格林奇是想用砍下西部帮派敌方的头
I bet Glitch thought he could make his bones

356
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,060
作为弥补过失的筹码
by cutting the heads off of Westie enemies.

357
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,590
我打赌他打算把这些头
Bet he planned on putting those heads

358
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,600
放在某些牙买加高层人士的床上
in some high-ranking Jamaican beds.

359
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,260
就像电影《教父》里的马头一样
Like a horse's head, "The Godfather."

360
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,460
这是你说过的最蠢的话了
Yeah, that's the stupidest thing you said yet,

361
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,510
蠢到连格林奇都会觉得是个好主意
and just dumb enough to seem smart to Glitch.

362
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,940
根据对他的了解  他肯定走漏了消息
And knowing that boy, he'd run his mouth,

363
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,820
牙买加人知道了这事  伏击了他
Jamaicans hear about it, and they ambush him.

364
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,500
快走
Come on.

365
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,500
我认识和牙买加人有关系的线人
I got a source on the street tied in with the Jamaicans.

366
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,670
他应该可以告诉我们情报
He'll be able to give us intel.

367
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,510
我爱死这种快攻办案方式了
I love this run-and-gun police work.

368
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:14,670
你在生气
You're upset.

369
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,500
没有
No.

370
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,720
好吧  我是生气  行了吧
Yes. Okay? Fine. Yes.

371
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,740
我以为
I thought that

372
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,330
我俩之间变得更加亲密了
the two of us were actually getting closer together,

373
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,340
现在看起来他是在疏远我
and now it seems like he's just pulling away.

374
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,130
你问过他原因吗
Have you asked him why?

375
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,570
问过  他说
Yes, and he said...

376
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,820
"一切都很好"
"Oh, everything is fine."

377
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:29,950
你为什么觉得不好呢
What makes you think it isn't?

378
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,310
因为他的所作所为都太混账了
Because he's acting like a complete jackass!

379
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,560
他手挽着小妞出现在分局
He shows up at the precinct with these bimbos hanging on his arm,

380
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,340
现在他又围在其他警察身边
And now he's running around with another cop.

381
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,740
那个其他警察是女性吗
Is this other cop a woman?

382
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,110
不  不  为什么...
No! No. Why...

383
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,750
为什么这么问
Why would you even ask that?

384
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:42,870
这根本不是重点
That's not even the point.

385
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:46,420
重点是  我不明白为什么他要这么做
The point is, I don't understand why he's acting like this.

386
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,400
我是说  我做了什么呢
I mean, what did I do?

387
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,130
也许  从他的视角来看
Well, maybe, from his point of view,

388
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,470
问题在于  你没做什么
The question is, what didn't you do?

389
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:53,340
等等  什么
Wait. What?

390
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,510
什么意思
W-what do you mean?

391
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,570
你中枪的时候  卡塞尔说他爱你
When you were shot, Castle said that he loved you.

392
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,040
那是多久前的事
How long ago was that?

393
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,900
七个月前
Seven months ago,

394
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,340
可我那时没准备好听他说那句话
but I wasn't ready to hear that then--

395
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,380
你觉得他用行动在告诉你什么
What do you think he's telling you with his behavior?

396
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,040
也许是
That maybe

397
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,160
他已经不再等候了
he's not there anymore?

398
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,780
也许他还没准备好
That maybe he's not ready?

399
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,470
要是我等太久了呢
What if I waited too long?

400
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,370
你不是在等  凯特  而是休养
You weren't waiting, Kate. You were healing.

401
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,640
是的  可也许在这段时间
Yeah, but then in the meantime,

402
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,720
他向前看了
he's moved on.

403
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,730
或者他在保护自己
Or he's protecting himself

404
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,150
不愿承担更多的感情风险
by not taking more emotional risks.

405
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,480
那我该怎么办
So then what do I do?

406
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,380
你想怎么办
What do you want to do?

407
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,270
要我就这么办
I tell you what I'd do,

408
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,800
我会对你的搭档暴露出原始野性
I'd go all caveman on that partner of yours.

409
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,750
让她看看什么才是真男人的作风
Show her what time it is in real-man land.

410
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,010
真男人的作风
Real-man land?

411
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,210
刚刚在停尸间
Oh, is that what you were showing Laura

412
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,190
你展现给劳拉的那种吗
when we were back at the morgue?

413
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,390
只是给她点关注
Just throw a little attention her way,

414
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,260
逗她开心
make her happy.

415
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,540
我现在想要的是那个新来的红发妞
You know who I'm mackin' on is this hot new redhead

416
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,710
她才刚来那边工作
just started working there.

417
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,690
那妞才十几岁的样子
That girl's barely street legal.

418
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,170
红头发吗
A redhead?

419
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:03,870
是啊
Yeah.

420
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,720
五尺五寸高  蓝眼睛  实习生
About 5'5", blue eyes, intern?

421
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,010
是啊  你认识她吗
Yeah. You know her?

422
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,750
那是我女儿
That's my daughter.

423
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,710
真的吗  那妞的屁股
Seriously? That girl got an ass--

424
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,750
放松点  夏洛克  逗你呢
Relax, Sherlock. I'm just playin'.

425
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:18,900
好吧
All right.

426
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,170
不管怎样  你都不许你碰我女儿
As long as we're clear that my daughter's off-limits.

427
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,440
就一个作家而言你挥拳还挺狠
Yeah. You pack a little punch there for a writer.

428
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,280
那是我要找的人
There's my guy.

429
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,150
别  你待在这儿
Nah, you stay here.

430
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,450
注意下周围情况
Keep an eye out.

431
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,870
-你没事吧  -问到了个名字
- You okay? - I got a name.

432
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,590
里面发生什么事了  你杀了他吗
What happened in there? Did you kill him?

433
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,650
你不会想知道的  我们没来过这儿
You don't want to know. We were never here.

434
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,050
-你在干什么  -妈呀
- What are you doing? - Jeez!

435
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,430
你没事吧
You okay?

436
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,290
那家伙疯了
That guy is insane.

437
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,740
是啊  我知道  我早说了
Yeah, I know. I tried to tell you.

438
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,280
不  他是个疯子
No, he's insane.

439
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:39,490
为什么  他干什么了
Why? What did he do?

440
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:41,720
妈呀
Jeez!

441
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,850
现在不能说
I can't talk now.

442
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:53,950
记得我的票
I want those tickets.

443
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,370
怎么了
What's up?

444
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,850
你在那边说什么
What are you talking about?

445
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,540
哪边
Where?

446
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:03,690
那边啊
Oh, there. Um...

447
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,810
没什么
Nothing.

448
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,060
我是说  显然  不是什么都没说
I mean, obviously, not nothing.

449
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,590
我们在聊天  我们就在说...
We were talking. We weren't just moving our...

450
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,520
我得去下厕所
I gotta go to the bathroom.

451
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,520
怎么回事
What the hell?

452
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,290
我以为你杀了他
I thought you killed him.

453
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,390
你真应该看看我走出门的时候
Yeah, you shoulda seen the look on your face

454
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,490
你脸上的表情
when I came out that door.

455
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,530
这可不好玩
That's not funny.

456
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,290
这可不好玩
That's not funny.

457
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,750
不  不好玩  简直要笑死人了
No, no, it's hysterical!

458
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,170
看看他们  在那里大笑
Look at 'em laughing it up.

459
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,440
好像这是他们的地盘似的
Just acting like they own the place.

460
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:58,140
我得去说点什么
I'm gonna say something.

461
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,770
别  别去  没必要
No, don't. It's not worth it.

462
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,460
我觉得他背叛了我们
I feel like he's cheating on us.

463
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:05,060
他没有背叛我们  莱恩  他只是...
He's not cheating on us, Ryan. He's just...

464
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:06,820
结交新朋友
branching out.

465
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,410
别记仇  伙计
Don't take it personally, son.

466
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:10,530
马克・吉布森
Marc Gibson.

467
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,230
我是黑帮组的卧底
I'm undercover on the gang task force.

468
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:14,080
我得确定能够信任你
I had to make sure I could trust ya,

469
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,730
如果出了岔子你会挺我
That you had my back if things got ugly.

470
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,400
很幸运  你通过了
Luckily, you passed.

471
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,730
牙买加人杀格林奇的事情你说对了
Well, you were right about the Jamaicans taking out Glitch.

472
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,990
住在墓地附近的人
Neighbors near the cemetery

473
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,430
在发生凶杀的那晚听到了枪声
heard gunshots on the night of the murder.

474
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,600
线人告诉我是一个叫马克西的小混混
Source tells me a low-level banger named Maxi

475
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,180
开的枪
was the one doing the shooting.

476
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,770
他躲在第一和第五大道的一个房子里
He's holed up in a building on avenue A and 5th.

477
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,830
出来走走  小伙子
Take a walk, fellas.

478
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,180
我们走吧  兄弟
Let's go, man.

479
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,730
马克西  为什么你要让事情这么难办呢
Maxi, why you gotta make this so hard, huh?

480
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,160
我们都知是你昨晚杀了那个西部帮派的小子
We both know you killed that Westie kid last night.

481
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,220
我想要律师
I want me lawyer.

482
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,380
你的律师吗
Your lawyer?

483
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,290
没问题  他就在这里
Sure. He's right in here.

484
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:46,950
等等
Wait!

485
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,310
你在干什么
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

486
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,410
告诉我谁杀了他  否则他们就得
Tell me you killed him or they're gonna have to

487
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,230
用水管把你冲出来了 马克西
hose you outta here, Maxi.

488
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,150
我没杀任何人
I didn't kill no one!

489
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,370
等等  等等
Wait! Wait!

490
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,790
等等  我接到个电话说有个西部帮派的人
Wait! I got a call that some Westie boy

491
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,180
到处说要把我们死去的朋友挖出来
was running his mouth about digging up our dead.

492
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,580
我去墓地伏击他
Me go out to the cemetery to ambush him,

493
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,140
但是我从没开过枪
but I never fire no shot!

494
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,810
你最好退后点
You better stand back.

495
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,540
这家伙会像颗葡萄那样炸开的
This guy's gonna pop like a grape.

496
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,410
不  等等  我发誓
No, wait! I swear!

497
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,210
他不是一个人  一群墨西哥人等在那里
He wasn't alone! A group of Mexicans was waiting there

498
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,850
靠着一辆豪华的卡迪拉克攀登
next to a tricked-out escalade!

499
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,860
你是说这事还涉及第三个帮派吗
Are you telling me a third gang is involved in this?

500
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,450
伙计  我不知道他们是谁  伙计
Man, I don't know who they are, man!

501
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,160
但格林奇显然是认识他们
But that Glitch clearly knew them!

502
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,090
他说他拿到头了  然后就突然出了乱子
He told 'em he had the heads, then things went south!

503
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,130
那些墨西哥人朝他开枪  然后就逃跑了
The Mexicans opened fire on him and took off running,

504
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,190
-我也是  -好的  好的  好的
- And so did I. - Okay, okay, okay,

505
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,820
那么就是墨西哥人追到了格林奇
So the Mexicans hunted down glitch,

506
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,420
然后杀了他
and they shot him.

507
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,270
或者就是他干的  还编故事骗我们
Or he did and he's making up a story.

508
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,060
不  不  不  我有证据
No, no, no, no, no! I can prove it!

509
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,160
那辆攀登上的是德克萨斯州牌照
The Escalade had Texas plates.

510
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,410
我看到了开头的两个字母  R和X
I saw the first two letters-- "R" And "X."

511
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:39,970
好吧  马克西
Okay, Maxi.

512
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,430
我们最好能查到这块牌照
But that license better check out,

513
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,520
不然我就回来收拾你这条小命
or I'm gonna come back here and recycle your ass.

514
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,900
能查到的  能查到的
It will check. It will check!

515
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,490
-我发誓  你们肯定能查到  -拜拜
- It'll check, man! I swear! - Bye-bye.

516
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,500
斯勒特  放我出去
Slaughter, get me out of here!

517
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,480
还有个团伙  貌似蛮可信的  是吗
Another gang. That's plausible, right?

518
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,120
没错
Yep.

519
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:53,680
你威胁过足够多的人
You threaten enough guys,

520
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,220
就能知道他们什么时候是说实话
you get a feel for their honesty.

521
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,930
不过刚刚你不会真打算压扁他吧
But you wouldn't have really crushed him?

522
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:57,820
当然不会啦
Nah, of course not.

523
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,810
更像是碾碎
It would've been more like a-a mangling.

524
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,790
斯勒特
Slaughter!

525
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:06,640
莱恩警探
Detective Ryan.

526
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:07,360
是我  卡塞尔
Yeah, it's Castle.

527
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,440
帮我查个不全的德州牌照
I have a partial Texas plate I need you to run.

528
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,220
开头两个字母是R和X
First letters "R" And "X."

529
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:12,800
这样啊  卡塞尔
Yeah, Castle.

530
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,250
这可有点难办
That's gonna be really tough for me.

531
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,560
我很忙的
I'm pretty busy.

532
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,360
是吗  你也来吗
Really? You, too, huh?

533
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,400
把法拉利借来
Get the Ferrari.

534
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,220
卡塞尔  珍妮总是缠着我
You know, Castle, Jenny's been bugging me

535
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,800
让我安排你跟她表亲拉莫纳见个面
to set you up with her cousin Ramona.

536
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:23,870
她是个口腔卫生医师
She's a dental hygienist.

537
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,200
嗯  不错
Mm-hmm. Sounds good.

538
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,910
-法拉利  -我这周末想借你的法拉利用用
- Ferrari. - And I want the Ferrari for the weekend.

539
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:32,520
好的  还有啊伙计  我不会忘记这事的
All right. Hey, and, buddy, I am never gonna forget this.

540
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:34,740
搞定
All right. We're all set.

541
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,190
好吧
All right.

542
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,890
明早我们就能拿到结果了
We'll get the results in the morning.

543
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,270
今晚嘛...我们庆祝一下
Tonight... we celebrate.

544
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:41,620
庆祝什么
Celebrate what?

545
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,350
庆祝你跟我一起工作的首日活了下来
Well, you survived the first day on the job with me.

546
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,410
你有搭档第一天就出事的吗
You ever have a partner who didn't?

547
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,250
我其实挺想去庆祝的  不过
You know, I'd love to, uh, celebrate, but--

548
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:52,940
不过什么
But what?

549
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:55,550
没什么  没什么
But nothing. But nothing.

550
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,940
我们...庆祝去
Let's... let's do this.

551
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,390
庆祝还能出什么事  对不
What's the worst that could happen, right?

552
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:07,860
发生什么事了
What happened?

553
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,670
老爸  我进了  我进了
Dad, I got in. I got in!

554
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,960
进什么了
Oh, where?

555
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,920
目前看来几乎哪都进了
Almost everywhere so far.

556
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:15,960
牛津  普林斯顿  还有萨拉劳伦斯学院
Oxford, Princeton, Sarah Lawrence.

557
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,780
太好了  亲爱的  我就知道你能行
That's great, honey. I-I knew it would work out.

558
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:19,610
真的吗
Really?

559
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:20,290
当然
Yeah.

560
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,420
那你为什么还要把这些信藏起来
Then why were you hiding the letters from me?

561
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,570
-什么  -拜托  老爸
- What? - Come on, dad.

562
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,720
邮戳上写着呢  有些信上周就到了
I can read a postmark. Some of these came last week.

563
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,570
我就是  对不起
Oh. I just--I'm sorry.

564
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,300
亲爱的  我怕你受伤而已
Honey, I-I'm just trying to protect you.

565
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,240
我都十八岁了
I'm 18 now.

566
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,640
你得相信我  我能照顾好...
You need to trust that I can take care of my...

567
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,170
自己
myself.

568
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,540
怎么了
What?

569
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,950
我进了斯坦福大学
I got into Stanford.

570
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,990
耶  太好了
Yes! Oh, great!

571
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,600
那不一直是你最向往的吗
That's always been your first choice, right?

572
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,400
可我怎么感觉你不太高兴
And yet, I sense trouble.

573
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:48,990
我不知道
I-I don't know.

574
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:50,960
我应该高兴才对
I mean, I should be happy,

575
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,670
可他们拒绝了我提早录取的申请
but after they shot me down for early admission...

576
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,780
他们当初没要你  你觉得遭到了背叛
They rejected you, and you feel betrayed.

577
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,390
我该怎么跨过那道坎
How am I supposed to get over that?

578
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:04,960
你气色好差
You look like crap.

579
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:07,570
给你  解酒的  能让你恢复精神
Here. Little hair of the dog. That'll get you flying right.

580
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,930
不用了  这也没法让时间倒流
No. It's not gonna do anything to turn back time.

581
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:11,870
我们究竟要去哪
Anyway, where are we going?

582
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,590
布朗克斯的修理厂
Salvage yard in the Bronx.

583
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,080
昨晚我自己查了那个德克萨斯州的牌照
I ran that Texas plate myself last night.

584
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,650
马克西说有第三方介入的事确实是真的
Turns out Maxi was telling the truth about the third player.

585
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,990
那辆攀登登记在一个叫凯撒・威勒斯的人名下
Escalade was registered to a Cesar Vales.

586
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,680
他是一个墨西哥帮派的
Runs with a Mexican gang.

587
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,140
据说他们想入侵纽约的地盘
Rumor has it they're making inroads into New York,

588
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,340
垄断这里的毒品市场
trying to corner the market on the city's crank trade.

589
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:31,120
于是威勒斯跑来这儿想跟
So Vales is coming into town trying to muscle in

590
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,150
西部帮派和牙买加人抢地盘
on the Westies and the Jamaicans.

591
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,960
是啊  这可不容易
Yeah, which ain't exactly easy to do.

592
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,710
如果他能让这两者互斗
Well, it would be a lot easier

593
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,600
那就容易得多了
if he could get them to take each other out.

594
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:40,970
不错嘛
That's good.

595
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:42,510
于是他想方设法
So he's sitting around

596
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,620
让西部帮派和牙买加人发生冲突
trying to think about a way to make that happen,

597
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,550
听到了格林奇的夸夸其谈
and he overhears Glitch running his mouth.

598
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:49,180
没错  他意识到  如果西部帮派有人被杀
Right, he realizes, if a Westie was to turn up murdered

599
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,530
还带着一袋子牙买加人的人头
with a bag full of Jamaican heads,

600
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,770
双方必然开战
both sides would go to war.

601
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:54,300
他们便能坐收渔翁之利
And they could jump in and take over their territories.

602
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:59,180
你确定我们就这样自己去找他合适吗
Are you sure it's such a good idea to go after this guy ourselves?

603
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,620
听马克西的口气  那帮人挺危险的
I mean, Maxi made 'em sound pretty dangerous.

604
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:02,950
小菜一碟
Piece of cake.

605
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,830
那家伙就是个不入流的废物而已
Guy's nothing but a two-bit punk.

606
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:06,950
他是墨西哥黑手党的高层人物
He's high-level Mexican Mafia.

607
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,840
非常危险
About as dangerous as they come.

608
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,050
缉毒局报告称  凯撒・威勒斯涉嫌
According to the D.E.A., Cesar Vales is suspected

609
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,440
十几起杀人案
in the deaths of over a dozen people,

610
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,330
其中包括三名墨西哥警察
including three cops in Mexico

611
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:17,500
被人用大锤砸死  还被碎了尸
who were killed with a sledgehammer and then cut up into pieces.

612
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,570
你说卡塞尔不会和斯勒特去找这个人了吧
You don't think Castle and Slaughter are going after him?

613
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:20,390
恐怕就是这样
I'd put money on it,

614
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,240
因为昨晚不止我一个人查了他的牌照
'cause I wasn't the only one who ran his plates last night.

615
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,780
斯勒特也查了
Slaughter did, too.

616
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,370
如果卡塞尔和斯勒特去找这家伙
If Castle and Slaughter go after this guy,

617
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,290
他们都会被干掉的
they're gonna both end up dead.

618
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:28,290
-我们得警告卡塞尔  -我试过了
- We need to warn Castle. - I tried,

619
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,720
给打他的电话都转到了语音信箱里
but his phone keeps going to voice mail.

620
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,780
我有种不好的预感
I got a bad feeling that

621
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,030
他们正在去抓威勒斯的路上
they're on their way to take down Vales right now.

622
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,910
你今天不会把谁碾碎吧
You're not gonna mangle anyone today, are you?

623
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,690
看看再说吧
I like to keep my options open.

624
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,910
对方人好多
There's an awful lot of 'em.

625
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,190
跟着我就行了
Just follow my lead.

626
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,120
你们好啊
Hola.

627
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,500
先生们  我代表纽约警局
Gentlemen, on behalf of the NYPD,

628
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,220
欢迎各位来到上帝之域最棒的城市
I'd like to welcome you to the greatest city on god's green earth.

629
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,490
除非你想让你的朋友
Unless you want your friends to see

630
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,640
看到你脑子里什么样
what the inside of your head looks like,

631
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,260
让开
back off.

632
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,410
有什么问题  警官
Wow. Now what seems to be the problem, officer?

633
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,350
你是威勒斯
You Vales?

634
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,300
就是我
That's me.

635
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,700
你知道麦克・莱利这个人吗
Name Michael Reilly mean anything to you?

636
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,590
也叫格林奇
A.K.A. Glitch.

637
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,220
没什么意义
No. I'm afraid not.

638
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,660
那可有意思了  因为有人看到
That's funny, 'cause I got an eyewitness

639
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,990
你和你的娘们
that puts you and your girls here

640
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:39,750
两晚前在皇后区向他开枪
shooting the hell outta him in Queens two nights ago.

641
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,090
那可真有趣
That is funny.

642
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,770
喂  你  你的警章呢
Hey, you. Where's your badge?

643
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,330
在他别的衣服里
In his other coat.

644
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,400
威勒斯  我们已经了解你的计划了
Yeah, Vales, we know all about your plan.

645
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,290
利用格林奇来引发帮派斗争
Use Glitch to spark a gang war

646
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:57,420
这样你就能把自己的毒品生意搬到纽约了
so you could move your drug business into New York.

647
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,820
喔  你的搭档
Wow. Your partner here,

648
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,430
他挺亢奋啊
he's pretty high-strung, isn't he?

649
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,390
是啊
Yeah.

650
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:04,820
-亢奋  是吧  -喔
- High-strung, huh? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

651
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,920
纽约警局
Hey! NYPD!

652
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,850
纽约警局  把手举起来
NYPD! Let me see your hands!

653
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,350
派对结束了
The party's over.

654
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:19,240
太遗憾了  才刚刚开始有点意思
That's too bad, because this was just getting interesting.

655
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,900
我要是你  就把事情都安排妥当
If I were you, I'd get your affairs in order,

656
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,790
因为我还会回来的
'cause I'll be back.

657
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,150
斯勒特
Hey! Slaughter.

658
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,830
像那样没有后援就冲进去
Going in there like that without backup,

659
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,140
把平民百姓陷于危险之中
putting a civilian in harm's way,

660
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,480
那不只鲁莽  还是警察失职
that's not only reckless, that is bad police work.

661
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,030
你该庆幸我们追踪到卡塞尔的手机
You're just lucky that we traced Castle's phone

662
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,680
及时找到了你们
and we found you guys in time.

663
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:40,250
你以为我会感谢你们几乎毁了我的计划吗
What, you think I'm gonna thank you for almost ruining my play?

664
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,400
你还有计划
You had a play?

665
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,010
我总有计划  得让事情升级
I always have a play. Had to escalate things.

666
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:48,220
这样我就能找出他们当中的弱者了
That way I could find the weak member of the herd.

667
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,090
那个孩子
That kid.

668
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,360
没错
Exactly.

669
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,920
我们就要靠他扳倒威勒斯
He's the one I'm gonna get to flip on Vales

670
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,610
只需想办法把他单独找出来
once I figure out how to separate him from the pack.

671
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,710
我们一起工作这么些年
Who knew all these years we've been working together

672
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,640
还不知你有意求死
that you had a death wish?

673
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,240
那个吗  那没什么不好
Come on, that? That wasn't bad.

674
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,800
斯勒特有个计划
Slaughter had a plan.

675
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,190
是啊  他的计划就是害死你
Yeah, he had a plan to get you killed.

676
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,820
现在下楼

677
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,670
是斯勒特
It's slaughter.

678
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,300
我得走了
I gotta go.

679
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,320
好吧
All right.

680
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,370
下次我们可能就不会去救你了
Next time, we might not be there to save you.

681
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,020
你得做点什么
You need to do something.

682
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:30,980
埃斯波  如果一个人拼命想离开巢穴
Espo, if the guy is hell-bent on leaving the nest,

683
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,430
那我没什么可做的了
then there is nothing that I can do about it.

684
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,540
你不是真这么想吧
You don't really feel that way, do you?

685
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,460
别听那些人唧唧歪歪  夏洛克
Don't you listen to those whiners, Sherlock.

686
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,800
你有种的
You got balls.

687
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,260
是  或许我刚刚没必要
Yeah, I may have needlessly put you

688
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,840
让你在威勒斯那儿犯险
in a little harm's way there with Vales,

689
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,070
但是还是有成效的
but seeing as it paid off...

690
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,950
有成效是什么意思
What do you mean, paid off?

691
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,520
-那是什么  -你说什么呢
- What was that? - What was what?

692
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,940
伙计  这么做不好吧
Hey, come on, man! It's not cool!

693
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,080
后备箱里有人吗
Is there someone in the trunk?

694
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,390
吉尔伯托・门多萨  我们要找的软肋
Gilberto Mendoza, our weak link.

695
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:04,170
快点放我出去  伙计
Get me the hell outta here, man!

696
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:08,180
告诉我我们只是和他谈谈
Please tell me that we are just going to talk to him.

697
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,380
差不多吧
Yeah, pretty much.

698
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,080
伙计  怎么回事  你不能这么做
Come on, man! What's going on?! You can't do that!

699
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,820
这么做不对  快停下
This is wrong. You gotta stop.

700
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,700
除非他告发威勒斯
Not till he flips on Vales.

701
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:24,620
你听见了吗  吉尔伯托
You hear that, Gilberto?

702
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,230
你想从后备箱出来  唯一的方法
Only way you're gettin' out of that trunk

703
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,850
就是供出你的老板
is if you rat out your boss.

704
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:30,120
告诉你吧  我是什么都不会说的
Well, guess what. I'm not sayin' nothing!

705
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,050
还记得你说我欠我人情的事吗
Hey, remember that favor you promised me?

706
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:38,090
有个民众审查委员会找我麻烦
There's this civilian review board thing coming up.

707
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:41,500
过度用武投诉  全都是废话  对吧
Excessive force complaints. Total B.S., right?

708
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,620
总之  你不是跟市长是朋友什么的
Anyway, you being a friend of the mayor and all,

709
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,150
我想你去说句话
I figure a statement from you

710
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:54,050
一定会让那些指控都撤销的  是吧
would go a long way to making those charges go away, right?

711
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,560
你疯了
You're crazy.

712
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,700
是"不"的意思吗
Is that a no?

713
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,540
我做  你停下我就做
I'll do it! I'll do it if you stop!

714
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,300
非常好  下周二
Outstanding. Next Tuesday.

715
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,710
上午九点准时
9:00 a.m. Sharp.

716
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:17,980
我会给你发邮件的
I'll send you an e-mail.

717
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,760
伙计  我知道我的权利
Hey, man, I know my rights, all right?

718
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,110
这是绑架  滥用执法权
This is kidnapping. Police abuse.

719
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,770
我也知道一些事  吉尔伯托
I know something, too, Gilberto.

720
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:26,810
你在德克萨斯州少管所里有个弟弟
You got a brother in juvie back in Texas.

721
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:28,100
可怜的海克特
Poor little Hector.

722
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,430
我听说他每天晚上都以泪洗面
I hear he cries himself to sleep every night.

723
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,600
你到底在做什么
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

724
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,310
就是和吉尔伯托聊会儿天
Just having a little chat here with Gilberto.

725
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:38,970
听着  除非你想让海克特有什么不测
Listen, unless you want something very bad to happen to Hector,

726
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,750
你得帮我扳倒威勒斯  行吧
you're gonna help me bury Vales, aren't ya?

727
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:43,820
听见了吗
Aren't ya?

728
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,720
-好  -好什么
- Okay. - Okay, what?

729
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,760
我需要听你说咒语
I need to hear the magic words.

730
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,660
威勒斯杀了格林奇
Vales killed Glitch.

731
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,610
威勒斯杀了格林奇
Vales killed Glitch.

732
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:57,450
胜利
Yes. Victory.

733
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:06,920
威勒斯当时在想办法抢过牙买加人
Vales was looking for a way to take over the Jamaicans'

734
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,400
和西部帮派的地盘
and the Westies' turf.

735
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,280
刚好我们听说有个西部帮派废物
That's when we heard about this punk-ass westie

736
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,550
想要证明自己  威勒斯看到了机会
trying to prove himself, and Vales saw his chance.

737
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,880
他说服格林奇
He convinced Glitch that

738
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,340
如果他挖出几个牙买加人并砍掉他们头
if he dug up a couple of Jamaicans and cut off their heads,

739
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,590
就能让他回到他西部帮派的伙伴当中
that it would get him back in tight with his westie pals.

740
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:21,570
威勒斯想用几个人头来引发一场帮派斗争
So Vales wanted to use the heads to spark a gang war?

741
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:23,250
让西部帮派和牙买加人都投入其中
For the Westies and Jamaicans to go at it

742
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,150
直到人都死光了
till no one's left standing,

743
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,010
他可以轻松过来占领地盘
then he waltzes in, takes over the territory?

744
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:27,090
是的
Yeah.

745
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,910
在墓地发生了什么
What went down at the cemetery?

746
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,180
威勒斯让格林奇去挖尸体
Vales got Glitch to dig up the bodies.

747
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,350
计划是杀了他
The plan was to kill him

748
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,330
伪装成牙买加人干的样子
and make it look like the Jamaicans did it.

749
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,850
格林奇一定是察觉到了什么
And Glitch must have sensed it or something,

750
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:40,070
我们一开火他就跑掉了
'cause he took off right as we started opening fire.

751
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,390
讲讲谋杀的事
Tell me about the murder.

752
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,730
孩子  我知道你有点害怕
Look, kid, I know you're scared,

753
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:50,100
我也有点粗暴
and I was a little rough.

754
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:53,570
但是我与检察官和联调局的人谈过了
But I talked to the D.A. and the feds.

755
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,900
他们说只要你配合我的调查
They said, you cooperate with me,

756
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,400
你弟弟将减到有期徒刑
your brother's sentence will be reduced to time served,

757
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,070
你们兄弟俩都将作为联邦证人受到保护
and both of you get a free ride into witsec.

758
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:03,430
赶紧告诉我怎么回事
So tell me how it went down.

759
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:09,250
我们追他  堵住了他
We chased him, we cornered him.

760
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,870
在天桥下面吗
Under the overpass?

761
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,390
是的
Yeah.

762
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,320
然后呢
And?

763
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,910
然后威勒斯两枪将他毙命
And then Vales shot him twice and just left him for dead.

764
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,330
到底多少枪
How many--how many times?

765
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,050
三枪
Three.

766
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,100
他开了三枪
He shot him three times.

767
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,140
你认为你在干什么
What do you think you're doing?

768
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,550
结案啊
Closing this case.

769
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,070
我拿到了威勒斯的逮捕令
I got an arrest warrant for Vales

770
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,170
就放在我口袋里等着派上用场呢
burning a hole in my pocket.

771
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:39,690
你在受审时指示那孩子按你的意图说
You coached that kid through his interrogation.

772
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:40,700
哪有
What? Nah, nah.

773
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,700
我只是帮助他回忆而已
I just refreshed his recollection.

774
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,130
真的吗  因为根据他的语气
Really? 'cause the way he was talking,

775
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,530
他甚至没有目击这起谋杀
he didn't even witness that murder.

776
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,700
嘿
Hey. H--

777
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,470
威勒斯身上的命案多到你不敢想象
Vales has bodies on him like you wouldn't believe--

778
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:53,320
女人  小孩  警察都有
Women, children, cops.

779
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,150
有机会逮住他  我绝不会浪费
And I got a chance to put him away. I'm gonna take it.

780
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:57,700
问题在于  你加入还是退出
The question is, are you in or out?

781
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,530
我想我还是退出吧
I guess I'm out.

782
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,650
真可惜
Well, that's a shame.

783
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:06,670
我对你寄予厚望呢  夏洛克
I had high hopes for you, Sherlock.

784
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,000
没想到你如此胆小怕事  
Never thought you'd punk out on me like this.

785
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,230
嘿
Hey.

786
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,140
我需要帮助
I need some help.

787
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,070
抱歉  卡塞尔  有案子在身
Sorry, Castle. Caught a murder.

788
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,480
跟贝克特说去
Talk to Beckett.

789
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:30,210
嘿
Hey.

790
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:31,890
你最近怎样
How's it going?

791
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:34,530
别拐弯抹角  卡塞尔  你想要什么
You can skip the small talk, Castle. What do you want?

792
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,140
斯勒特做得过头了
Slaughter went too far.

793
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,840
那是他的作风啊
Well, isn't that what he does,

794
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,280
绝赞威武  风光无两
Along with kicking ass and taking names?

795
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:43,590
他为了能抓捕威勒斯
He pressured a kid into making a false statement

796
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,980
威逼证人做假口供
so he could arrest Vales.

797
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,150
于是你找我去弥补
So you came to me so I can fix it?

798
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,270
你完全有理由生气
You have every right to be mad.

799
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,170
你向我警告过斯勒特的为人  我却当耳旁风
You warned me about Slaughter, and I wouldn't listen.

800
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:51,240
我只是想弥补这一切
I'm just trying to make this right.

801
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,120
这不是我的案子  卡塞尔
It's not my case, Castle.

802
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,690
即使我想帮忙
Even if I wanted to help,

803
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:56,020
我们也有一套严格的规定
we've got strict rules about

804
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,940
限制我们干涉其他警察的案子
interfering in another cop's investigation.

805
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,890
我不是要你帮我的忙
I'm not asking you to do it for me.

806
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,850
我是求你为了
I'm asking you to do it

807
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:04,230
不使真凶逃脱惩罚而这样做
so the real killer doesn't get away with murder.

808
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,460
你这么明目张胆的操纵我
What makes you think I'm actually gonna fall

809
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,160
我凭什么上钩
for that blatant manipulation?

810
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,380
因为我说的是实话
Because it's true.

811
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,920
这是什么
What's this?

812
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,070
监控录像拍摄显示威勒斯的车子
A traffic cam shot of Vales' car

813
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:23,430
离公墓有十个街区  朝格林奇被杀所处天桥
10 blocks from the cemetery, heading away from the overpass

814
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:24,960
反方向行驶
where Glitch was killed.

815
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,840
11点57
11:57.

816
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,780
格林奇是午夜之后被害的
Glitch was killed after midnight.

817
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:31,460
这表明威勒斯不可能杀害他
This shows that Vales couldn't have killed him.

818
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,430
你这是为我做的吗
You did this for me?

819
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,510
你一直都在保护我
All this time, you had my back.

820
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,300
我让莱恩查了监控录像
I had Ryan run a traffic cam search

821
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,980
那时他正在帮某人调车牌
while he was pulling a plate.

822
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,640
这不是确凿证据  卡塞尔
It's not a smoking gun, Castle.

823
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,430
知道吗  你连威勒斯的脸都看不到
Okay? You can't even see Vales' face in that photo.

824
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:50,350
这还不足以使斯勒特改变想法
It's not enough to change Slaughter's mind

825
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,230
除非你还有别的证据
unless you've got something else.

826
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,360
还有一个说不通的疑点
There is one more thing that doesn't make sense.

827
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,470
这是那块区域的地图
This is a map of the area.

828
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:00,550
这里是公墓  这里是天桥
Here's the cemetery. Here's the overpass.

829
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:03,130
但是若要到达那里  格林奇得翻1.8米的围墙
But to get to it, Glitch would have to climb a 6-foot fence.

830
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:06,420
一街区之隔就有个地铁  他为何还要那样做呢
Why do that when there's a subway station a block away?

831
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,440
如果可以逃跑为啥还要躲藏呢
Why hide when you can run?

832
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,070
也许我们能解开谜底
Maybe we can find out.

833
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:14,040
根据鉴证组报告
According to the C.S.U. report,

834
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,610
格林奇是在这附近被射中的
Glitch was shot somewhere around here. Uh-huh.

835
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:17,510
他蹒跚着逃走
He staggered away

836
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,320
最终死在柱子的另一边
and ended up on the other side of that pillar.

837
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,880
那么你认为威勒斯的计划就是利用格林奇
So you think that Vales' plan was to use Glitch

838
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,060
和牙买加黑帮的头目来挑起黑帮火并
and the jamaican heads to start up a gang war?

839
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:24,920
是的  有什么不对吗
Yeah. Why?

840
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,960
我不知道  卡塞尔  跟我了解到的证据对不上
I don't know, Castle. That's not what I'm seeing.

841
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,290
假设我是威勒斯
Let's say I'm Vales

842
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,940
射杀了格林奇挑起火并
and I shoot Glitch to start that war.

843
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:33,860
你认为哪儿会是
Where do you think would be

844
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,060
最佳抛尸地点
the best spot to drop off that body?

845
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,760
西部帮派的地盘
In the middle of westie territory.

846
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,780
没错  那为何他会将尸体留在这儿
Exactly. So why did he leave it here?

847
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,410
糟糕
Oh, crap.

848
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,760
好吧
Well...

849
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:50,470
想象一下当我带着凶手到分局  听说你们
Imagine my surprise when I got to the station with my killer,

850
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:52,980
在我的犯罪现场搅和的时候有多惊讶吧
and I hear you're stirring up my crime scene.

851
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,200
听着  我可以解释
Okay, look, I can explain.

852
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,590
省省吧  他不懂规矩  但你是知道的
Save it. He doesn't know any better, but you do.

853
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,450
我知道的是你对一个18岁的少年
What I know is that you coerced a confession

854
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:01,020
刑讯逼供
out of an 18-year-old kid.

855
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,790
我没有逼供杰克
I didn't coerce Jack.

856
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,840
他老大手里杀死的人的尸体
He works for a guy who's got a trail of bodies

857
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,690
多得连起来都能排到格兰德河了
that stretches all the way back to the rio grande.

858
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:08,110
如果这次不抓住他
If he doesn't go down for this,

859
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,320
他还会残害更多人
the body count just grows.

860
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,020
我们有监控录像显示威勒斯的凯迪拉克
We got a traffic video camera photo of Vales' escalade

861
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,620
在案发时离现场有10街区呢
10 blocks from here when the murder went down.

862
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:16,440
那有怎样  你能看见他在车里吗
Yeah, so what? Could you see him in the car?

863
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:17,960
看不清
Not exactly.

864
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,350
如果他的律师得到了这个证据
And if his lawyer gets ahold of it,

865
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:21,160
他们就可以提出合理质疑
you've handed him reasonable doubt,

866
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,850
威勒斯就会免于刑罚
And Vales walks.

867
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:23,950
也许他本就不该受罚
Maybe he deserves to walk.

868
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:26,200
他应该被五马分尸
He deserves to be pulled apart by horses.

869
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,970
但是法律不允许我这样做
But the law says I can't do that.

870
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:29,000
但是我能做的是
But what I can do is,

871
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,280
让他下辈子都在牢里度过
I can lock him up in prison for the rest of his life.

872
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,870
现在问题在于  你们要么别插手
Now the question is, are you gonna back off

873
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:36,790
要么我就举报你们干涉我的案子
or am I gonna have to report you for jumping my case?

874
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:39,320
你做你该做的  斯勒特
You do what you gotta do, Slaughter.

875
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,840
我做我该做的
And I'll do the same.

876
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,750
多谢
Thanks.

877
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,960
在我被警监狠狠教训之前
We got about an hour to figure out who really killed Glitch

878
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,080
我们还有一个小时查清
before I get called to the carpet

879
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,820
杀死格林奇的真凶
by the chief of detectives.

880
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:55,990
他会怎么对你
What can he do to you?

881
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:57,660
最好的情况是
Well, best-case scenario,

882
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,990
停职
he suspends me.

883
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:01,040
最坏的情况呢
And worst-case scenario?

884
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:05,730
糟了
Crap.

885
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,560
我扮演格林奇
So I'm Glitch.

886
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,170
我挖出三具尸体  砍下了他们的头
I just dug up three bodies, cut the heads off 'em,

887
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:15,320
很恐怖
which was horrible,

888
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,940
试图以此跟西部帮派示好
to try and win my way back in with the westies.

889
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,480
然后那个我以为是在帮我的
And then the kindly Mexican gentlemen

890
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,330
"善良"的墨西哥绅士
I thought were helping me

891
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:22,030
突然拔出枪想要杀死我
suddenly pull out guns and try to kill me.

892
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,540
拼命逃跑
Running for my life,

893
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,540
一直跑到围栏这边
I end up on the wrong side of this fence.

894
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:29,160
这里你能看到地铁的标志
Where you can see a sign for the subway.

895
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,500
明明可以向右跳上列车离开
So why would you climb a barbed wire fence

896
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:36,050
为什么还要爬过这个带倒刺铁丝的围栏呢
when can just hang a right and hop a train outta here?

897
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,260
恐惧
Fear.

898
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,510
我只知道  墨西哥人
For all I know, the Mexicans

899
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,300
沿着街道开车找我
are driving the streets looking for me.

900
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,400
这些街道上灯火通明  我很容易暴露
With all these street lights on, I'd be a sitting duck.

901
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,490
而在这下面  一片漆黑
But under here, it would be pitch black,

902
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:48,430
所以我爬过围栏躲起来
so I climb the fence and I hide.

903
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,530
能逃脱为什么还要躲起来呢
Why hide when you can escape?

904
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,760
因为我不仅仅是躲着
Because I wasn't just hiding.

905
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,080
我在等待  因为叫了后援
I was waiting. I called for help.

906
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,290
但他们发现格林奇的尸体时
But when they found Glitch's body,

907
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:58,630
并没有在他身上找到手机  所以
he didn't have a phone on him, so--

908
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:01,000
所以要么是凶手拿走了  要么...
So either the killer took it or...

909
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,570
要么就是他使用了付费电话
Or he used that pay phone.

910
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:09,390
为什么叫我来这里
Why'd you call me down here?

911
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:13,870
因为我们有充足的证据证明不是威勒斯杀了格林奇
Because we have definitive proof that Vales didn't kill Glitch.

912
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:15,610
你想当面让我难堪吗
And you want to rub my face in it?

913
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:16,610
不是
No.

914
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:18,870
斯勒特  听好  我们是不同的警察
Look, Slaughter, we're different kinds of cops.

915
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:19,450
没错
Yeah.

916
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:21,920
尽管我不赞同你的方法
And although I'm not a fan of your methods,

917
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,790
我知道  明知真凶还逍遥法外
I know you don't want to send an innocent man to jail

918
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:26,540
你是不会让其他人无辜入狱的
when you know that the real killer is still out there.

919
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,200
好吧  那么是谁杀了格林奇
Okay. So who killed Glitch?

920
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,480
我们知道他打给你了  布莱恩
We know he called you, Brian.

921
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,560
你儿子在被杀前半小时
Your son dialed your cell from that pay phone

922
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,480
用那个付费电话打了你的手机
about a half an hour before he was murdered,

923
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,410
而且你接了电话
and you answered that call.

924
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,300
我们还有凶案前后
We also have surveillance photos

925
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:48,630
你在地铁站的
of you at that subway stop from before

926
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,180
监控照片
and after the murder.

927
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,750
这么些年
All those years...

928
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,140
这么些烂摊子
All those screwups--

929
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:57,150
对于像你这样有胆识的人来说一定很难忍受吧
Must have been unbearable for a stand-up guy like you,

930
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,360
布莱恩  是吗
Huh, Brian?

931
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:01,310
格林奇打给你  告诉你他又一次
And then Glitch calls you to tell you that he screwed up

932
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:02,560
搞糟了
again.

933
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:05,530
但是这一次  很特别  对吗
But this time, it was different, wasn't it?

934
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:09,990
他逾矩了
He'd crossed the line.

935
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:10,950
他是你的儿子
He was your son.

936
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,610
所以我要对他负责
Which made him my responsibility.

937
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,710
所以我做了该做的
So I did what had to be done.

938
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,360
他一点都不吃惊
He wasn't even surprised.

939
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,820
就好像他等这一刻等了一辈子
'twas if he'd been waiting for it his whole life.

940
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,670
那你为什么不带走他们的头
Then why didn't you take the heads?

941
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:37,300
那样的话  这一切都不会追查到你和西部帮派
That way, none of this would come back on you and the westies.

942
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:41,510
我开枪之后他就消失在了黑暗里
He vanished into the dark after I'd shot him.

943
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,000
即使只有最后一口气
Even with his last breath,

944
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,080
那孩子也要毁了我
that boy managed to screw me up.

945
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:51,900
至少最终你给布莱恩定了罪
Well, at least you'll finally get a conviction on Brian.

946
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,960
这也多少算是有点安慰了
That's gotta be some consolation.

947
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,260
但是威勒斯还没被抓到
But Vales still walks.

948
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,110
抱歉
Excuse me.

949
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,860
律师
Counselor.

950
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:06,270
我能和你的委托人说两句吗
Can I speak with your client for a second?

951
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:08,240
她可能想要我的签名
She probably wants my autograph.

952
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,600
你自我感觉良好  我知道
You feel cocky. I get it.

953
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,420
你刚刚摆脱谋杀控诉
You just dodged a murder rap.

954
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:15,200
今晚大概要出去和你的弟兄们庆祝一下
Probably gonna go out tonight and celebrate with your boys,

955
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,490
你也应该狂欢痛饮一番
and you should paint the town.

956
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:19,770
但是明天早晨
But then in the morning,

957
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:24,580
我要你滚出这个城市
I want you to get the hell out of my city.

958
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,620
但是我喜欢这里

你可能现在喜欢

但是明天开始  你就会见识到
But starting tomorrow, you're gonna see

961
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,290
纽约警局全部警力
just how hard a city New York can be

962
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,270
都要弄垮你的日子
when the full force of the NYPD

963
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:36,120
是多么艰辛
comes crashing down on you.

964
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,650
三万警察
With 30,000 cops

965
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:40,570
把这列入日常工作表中  会让你的生活
making it their daily duty to make your life

966
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:42,470
生不如死
a living hell.

967
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,970
律师  你现在可以带他走了
Counselor, you can take him away now.

968
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:49,540
真性感
Oh, that is sexy.

969
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,670
干嘛  你又想因为这句话揍我吗
What, you want to hit me for that, too?

970
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,800
不想
No.

971
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,400
这拳是为了你不帮我
That's for not having my back.

972
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,810
还有  如果我看到
Oh, and if I ever see

973
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:03,450
你小说中有类似我的角色
a character in one of your novels like me,

974
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,490
那我们就要好好谈谈了
we're gonna have words.

975
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:06,430
那么  我们周二听证会见吧
So I'm gonna see you at the hearing on Tuesday, Right?

976
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,560
好的
You got it.

977
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,990
好极了
Outstanding.

978
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,640
探长  如果你想要痛快喝酒
Detective, you ever want to go on a date

979
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:14,030
酒醉打架  之后火辣亲热
that ends in hot sex after a drunken fistfight,

980
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,160
你知道在哪能找到我
you know where to find me.

981
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,240
是...啊  做你的梦吧
Uh, yeah, in never-gonna-happen land.

982

非常感谢你的帮助

983
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:23,850
不客气  卡塞尔
No problem, Castle.

984
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,830
这是搭档应该做的事
It's what partners are supposed to do.

985
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,910
享受成功的荣耀吗
Basking in the glory of you?

986
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:42,160
不是  是想弄明白应该怎么做
No, trying to figure out what to do.

987
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,630
斯坦福一直是我梦寐以求的学校
Stanford has always been my dream school.

988
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,370
但是如果他们首次拒绝信
But what if their initial rejection

989
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:48,050
是在暗示我
was the university sending me a sign

990
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:49,640
我最好申请其他学校呢
that I'm better off somewhere else?

991
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,840
你觉得你去其他学校更好吗
You think you'd be better off somewhere else?

992
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,600
我不知道
I don't know.

993
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,090
你觉得呢
Do you?

994
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,600
我也不知道
I don't know, either.

995
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:00,380
我想问题是
I guess the question is,

996
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,220
你是不是渴望到
do you want it badly enough...

997
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,540
可以不顾之前的伤害
to get over being hurt?

998
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:12,130
你知道什么能帮上忙吗
You know what I think would help with this decision?

999
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:15,350
-冰淇淋  -冰淇淋
- Ice cream. - Ice cream.

1000
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:18,110
比你快
Race you.

1001
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,900
你赖皮
That's cheating!
