1
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,000
come on. let me show you my place, huh?

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,300
oh! i gotta tweet this.

3
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,900
<i>no one will believe i'm with... the terrific nick.</i>

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,900
uh, "authentic" nick.

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,900
not "terrific," okay?

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,000
i mean, uh... we're the best.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,500
i'll bet. mm-hmm.

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,300
and it smells so good.

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,300
it does... smell good.

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,700
somebody here?

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,200
dad?

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,300
it smells like ribs. is that barbecue pizza?

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,100
no, we don't do barbecue pizza, all right?

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,600
that's for the hacks like terrific nick.

15

18
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,500
ooh, nice and crispy.

19
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,300
just the way you like it.

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,400
you eat it. i'm not hungry.

21
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,100
you've never said no to turkey bacon.

22
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,500
what's wrong? nothing.

23
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,500
something.

24
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,100
don't make me tong you.

25
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,800
not even a smile. must be serious.

26
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,900
it's lauren's birthday party. i'm not going.

27
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,800
what? you been talking about that party for weeks.

28
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,700
"it's gonna be the party of the century." yesterday lauren came up to me,

29
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,900
and in front of everybody, told me i was disinvited.

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,700
it was humiliating. why would lauren do something like that?

31
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,900
<i>she's one of your best friends. she was  one of my best friends.</i>

32
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,600
i have no idea why she's acting like this,

33
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,300
and she refuses to talk to me, and ashley's still invited,

34
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,300
and so is everyone else.

35
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,600
and it's like i'm a social leper. well, ashley's not gonna go without you.

36
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,700
just because i have leprosy doesn't mean he should.

37
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,500
well, i think you should throw a rival party

38
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,600
and invite all your friends to that one instead. the party's tonight, and she has a live band performing.

39
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,600
i can't compete with that. well, then i'll call lauren's mom, and i'll--

40
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,600
you're joking, right?

41
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,400
what, so i can be a leper and a tattletale?

42
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,400
i'm 17. i can deal with this on my own.

43
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,100
it's just... every instinct in my body

44
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,800
is telling me to protect her.

45
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,200
yeah, but when it comes to teenagers,

46
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,900
not even you can protect her. alexis is gonna have to deal

47
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,300
with backstabbers her whole life.

48
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,800
but she's intelligent enough to rise above all of that.

49
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,800
i don't know. she looked like she was ready to commit murder.

50
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,400
speaking of murder.

51
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,500
i thought terrific nick's on the east side was number one.

52
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,700
uh, no, that's authentic terrific nick's.

53
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,800
this is just authentic nick's. this isn't terrific?

54
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,800
no, just authentic. it's also not terrific authentic nick's,

55
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,000
but that's across the street. what's the difference?

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,900
the difference is, this one has a dead body in the oven.

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,400
o-kay.

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,500
that is really... well-done.

59
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,900
another couple of hours, maybe, but luckily for me, he's only half-baked.

60
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,100
male, mid-40s, that's about as much i.d. as i can give you.

61
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,800
based on the oven setting and the body's core temperature,

62
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,800
i'd say he went in no sooner than 2:00 a.m. i'm afraid to ask. cause of death?

63
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,200
it wasn't the oven. the stab wound through the chest

64
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,900
says he was dead when he went in.

65
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,000
no sign of forced entry.

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,300
but we're running the prints on the door handle just the same.

67
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,100
all right. run 'em on the oven as well.

68
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,700
who found him? uh, nick jr.

69
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,800
unbelievable. give me his number.

70
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,000
authentic, not terrific.

71
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,500
no. i got no idea who he is.

72
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,300
i mean, i open up the oven, and bam--there he is.

73
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,400
and who were the last ones here last night? my dad and me.

74
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,600
we closed around 11:00,

75
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,100
and then i hit up the kaydar lounge,

76
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,800
met up with a lady friend, and then we came back here

77
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,700
to, uh... have a slice.

78
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,600
and when was that?

79
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,100
i don't know. 4:30.

80
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,800
where's your lady friend now? she was kinda throwing up a lot,

81
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,600
so the paramedics had to take her in.

82
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,400
oh, but i kept her number.

83
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,000
i-i don't think there's gonna be a second date.

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,600
yeah, you're right. i'm sorry.

85
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,400
i'm gonna need a list of all of your employees

86
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,300
and delivery staff. you don't think it was one of our guys in the oven, do you?

87
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,500
as soon as you get me that list, i'll start making phone calls.

88
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,300
i don't believe this.

89
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,400
you gotta be kidding me.

90
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,800
dad, these are the cops.

91
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,300
you must be authentic nick.

92
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,100
the one and only. nick?

93
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,400
i have the proprietor listed as ralph carbone.

94
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,300
yeah, that's me. everybody calls me nick. why?

95
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,100
because that's what everybody calls me.

96
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,400
i can't believe those bastards put a body in my oven.

97
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,600
i'm sorry, mr. carbone. you think that you know who did this? yeah, sure.

98
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,300
i'll bet it was that jackhole.

99
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,600
terrific authentic nick?

100
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,700
sal malavolta. he used to work for us years ago before opening

101
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,800
his own lousy pizza shop right across the street. he stole my friggin' recipes.

102
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,600
it's sal that done this, along with the other two.  the other two?

103
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,200
yeah, that vulture there. terrific nick?

104
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,500
vinnie delfino. and that dirtbag there.

105
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,600
and authentic terrific nick.  luca sabalini.

106
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,100
all three of them, they're thieves.

107
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,800
they live off our name, and they're not even real nicks.

108
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,100
i'm the only real nick. and your real name is ralph.

109
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,200
exactly. they been trying to run me outta dodge for years.

110
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,000
and now this. who's gonna buy my pizza now, huh?

111
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,100
hey! hey! you happy? i'm outta business!

112
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,500
mr. carbone, what makes you think that one of them did this?

113
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,800
a few weeks ago, one of them

114
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,700
snuck a gallon of soap into my secret sauce.

115
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,000
cost me a whole day of returned pies.

116
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,500
now look, uh, i may or may not have retaliated,

117
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,800
but if i did, them putting a cadaver in my oven

118
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,100
that's, uh, them retaliating back.

119
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,100
mr. carbone, that's not a cadaver.

120
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,000
what do you mean? it's a--they bor-- they--they got this from some medical school.

121
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,900
no, this isn't a prank. this is murder.

122
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,700
we got through to all their employees.

123
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,100
everybody's accounted for. lanie, what are the chances of getting an i.d.?

124
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,200
i'm not hopeful on fingerprints. we may have to wait

125
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,500
for a missing persons report and dental records. we also started a canvass

126
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,100
to see if anybody saw anything last night.

127
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,000
all right, let's get statements off all the employees, especially the ones with keys.

128
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,200
i'd like to know what they were doing last night.

129
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,900
shouldn't we look into the other nicks, too?  come on, bro. you don't really think

130
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,800
this is about some kind of pizza rivalry, do you?

131
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,700
competition to be the best in new york, clear animosity?

132
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,500
carbone said they'd broken in before.

133
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,200
if we are looking into everyone with access,

134
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:17,000
we should look into them as well. he's right, you know? pizza's serious business in this town.

135
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,200
all right. great. you talk to them. wait. me?

136
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,200
no, i... come on.

137
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,500
you know, you have to admit, a pizza oven--

138
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,400
very clever way to get rid of a body.

139
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,300
in "at dusk we die," i had my psychotic paralegal

140
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,800
kill her abusive boss and put him in a pottery kiln.

141
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,000
he was reduced to ashes in a matter of hours.

142
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,500
of course, you already know this, don't you?

143
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,900
that's probably what our killer planned on doing until nick jr. showed up. did i hear right?

144
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,000
you found a body in the oven at terrific nick's?

145
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,500
<i>authentic nick's. authentic nick's?</i>

146
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,900
oh, thank god. the wife loves terrific nick's.

147
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,900
i didn't have the heart to tell her it now came in full-bodied flavor.

148
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,700
oh, i liked it. i liked it.

149
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,500
so we ran through all of authentic nick's employees.

150
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,400
they alibied out, but i did find a bunch of stuff

151
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,500
on the other nicks. criminal complaints?

152
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,200
yeah, dozens of them filed back and forth between

153
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,300
all the nicks over the years-- bricks through front windows,

154
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,300
slashed delivery car tires, ooh, flaming bags of poo.

155
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,400
thank you. yep.

156
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,600
what, that's it?

157
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,800
flaming bags of poo, soap in secret sauces?

158
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,800
come on, castle. what do you think,

159
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,400
these guys suddenly graduated from frat pranks to murder?

160
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,500
beckett.

161
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,900
as expected, the body was too badly burned to get any prints,

162
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,300
but i did find this.

163
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,800
you see here where the shin bone should be?

164
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,300
those are titanium plates.

165
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,200
so killer cyborg sent from the future, resistance fighters intercept his coordinates,

166
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:51,000
redirect him into a pizza oven, saving humanity. the plates have serial numbers.

167
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,800
i ran 'em through the surgical database

168
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,300
and got an i.d.

169
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,900
gordon burns.

170
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,400
<i>gordon burns? yes, castle, burns.</i>

171
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,800
go ahead, make your joke. get it out of your system.

172
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,800
gordon burns, as in "new york ledger"? you know him?

173
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,500
well, not personally. he was a reporter.

174
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,900
i used to love his work.

175
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,500
did you find anything else on the body?

176
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,700
a melted cell phone belt clip, but there was no cell phone.

177
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
yeah, it wasn't at the crime scene, either.

178
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,900
and that's his wallet.

179
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,800
some credit cards,

180
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,000
driver's license-- that's all melted.

181
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
girlfriend, wife?

182
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,100
burns is listed as divorced, no next of kin.

183
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,700
he was a war correspondent, an investigative reporter.

184
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,900
what was he doing in a pizza oven?

185
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,200
maybe his editor knows.

186
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,000
we were friends, so when i became editor of the paper, he was my first hire.

187
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,800
the kinds of stories he wrote, he must have stepped on his fair share of toes.

188
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,900
not for years. he'd been out of the game for a while. why is that?

189
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,900
his kid was killed in an accident.

190
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:59,300
she was 10. after that, he finally gave in to his love affair with the bottle.

191
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,200
we see that you still had him on the payroll.

192
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,700
he did the occasional human interest story for our lifestyles section.

193
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:09,700
a waste of his talent, but it let him make rent, keep his insurance.

194
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,900
mr. shaw, was he working on anything recently?

195
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,600
just a puff piece i had assigned him last week. about what?

196
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,900
the pizza wars. you know, those authentic, amazing,

197
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,000
terrific guys always fighting over which one's the best.

198
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,500
it wasn't afghanistan.  but gordon was gordon.

199
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,600
he called a few days ago and said it was much bigger

200
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,400
than i thought. bigger how?

201
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,700
he didn't say, but i mean, it's pizza wars.

202
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,700
how big could it be? big enough to kill for.

203
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,500
let's dig deeper into all of the nicks-- terrific, authentic, and otherwise,

204
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,900
and let's also run background checks

205
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,400
on all of their employees. you know, this guy survived afghanistan,

206
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,900
the invasion of iraq, even tiananmen square, to be killed doing a puff piece on pizza?

207
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,000
it's like being a cop, bro.

208
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,300
you survive a firefight with a dozen armed gangbangers

209
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,100
only to be hit by a car

210
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,000
while writing a speeding ticket on the l.i.e.

211
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,200
hey, i ran a trace on burns' missing phone.

212
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,200
it's either out of battery or turned off.

213
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,200
all right, run l.u.d.s and financials. i want to

214
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,000
find out where he was and what he was doing last night. on it.

215
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,900
this has to be about something bigger than who has the best pizza.

216
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,500
you know, burns probably had notes and drafts of his story in his apartment.

217
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,300
if we can find them, we can figure out

218
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,600
what he was up to last night.  let's go.

219
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,800
door's been kicked open.

220
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,400
room's clear.

221
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,200
this place is trashed.

222
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,000
i'm gonna check with the neighbors, see if anybody heard anything. okay.

223
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,000
these drawers have been emptied.

224
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,300
if there were files or notes, they're gone now.

225
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,500
well, whatever he was working on,

226
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,300
someone didn't want us to find it.

227
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,300
you okay?

228
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,800
yeah. no, yeah.

229
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,500
i think i met her.

230
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,500
i went to a book signing of his, the one he did on the, uh,

231
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,000
sarajevo snipers.

232
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,500
she was...

233
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,300
coloring next to him while he was signing books.

234
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,500
he must have been a good writer for you to stand in line.

235
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,800
yeah. he was.

236
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,000
come on. let's go get c.s.u.

237
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,200
hey. i got something weird.

238
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,200
burns' neighbor, she says she's been holding

239
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,700
his mail for the last week. apparently burns told her

240
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,100
he was going out of the country for a while. out of the country? we know he's been here.

241
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,000
you know, that's the kind of lie that you tell people when you don't want anyone looking for you.

242
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,900
and if he's been staying somewhere else, there's a chance we could still find his notes.

243
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,500
i'm gonna to get ahold of his editor, find out where he might have been staying.

244
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,500
how does a story about pizza send somebody into hiding?

245
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,100
or get them killed? beckett.

246
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,400
hey. just got the c.s.u. report back.

247
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,800
the back doorknob of the pizza shop was wiped clean,

248
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,700
but they did find nick's prints all over the pizza oven.

249
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,800
well, that's to be expected. i mean, he worked there.

250
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,800
not authentic nick.

251
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,300
these prints belong to his neighbor across the street-- terrific authentic nick.

252
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,700
so, nick, or should i say sal?

253
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,700
know this guy? yeah, i know him.

254
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,900
that's the reporter doing the story on us.

255
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,700
and what did the two of you talk about?

256
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,600
who's the real nick, and i told him about my grandpa nick

257
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,400
and how he was an authentic ellis island immigrant

258
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,400
who was flipping his terrific dough on mott street the very day he arrived.

259
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,200
what else? that's it. why?

260
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,500
just doesn't seem like a good enough reason to kill.

261
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,800
kill? we found your fingerprints, sal, all over the oven.

262
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,500
<i>you found my prints?</i>

263
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,500
yeah.

264
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
so why don't we back up? and you tell us why you killed burns.

265
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,800
and this time, hold the extra cheese. i-i can explain.

266
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,300
i was there, but i didn't kill nobody.

267
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,200
ralph thought i was soaping his sauce,

268
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,200
so he broke into my place and took all the breakers out of my electrical panel.

269
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,000
now he's always bragging about his oven, so i thought i'd--

270
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,300
put a body in it.

271
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,000
no, steal it. i went over there a couple nights ago to see what i need to get it out.

272
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,200
you're kidding me, right?

273
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,200
i was in o'meary's on staten island last night, till closing.

274
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,700
okay? it was dart night. i took third place.

275
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,100
you want to look at somebody, look at ralph. why ralph?

276
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,600
what do you think, he makes that money with his crappy pizza?

277
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,500
he's connected. that's why i left.

278
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,600
all he cares about is laundering money for his wise guy pals.

279
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,000
you didn't happen to mention this to burns, did you?

280
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,700
as a matter of fact, i did.

281
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,500
money laundering? whoa.

282
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,400
we ran you through the federal database.

283
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,200
we know about the fbi investigation in the '90s

284
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,400
and about your connection to the spolano crime family.

285
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,200
my connection?

286
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,900
he's my second cousin once removed.

287
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,100
i see him at thanksgiving once every five years.

288
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:03,000
and the feds never found anything. the feds didn't, but maybe burns did.

289
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,400
so what happened, ralph? did he threaten to expose you?

290
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,100
you make him... disappear until your--your kid showed up

291
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,700
before that oven you're so proud of could finish the job?

292
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,800
i make money with my pizza.

293
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,900
you want to look at my books? go ahead.

294
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,900
you're gonna find exactly the same thing the feds found--

295
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,600
nada, zip, zilch.

296
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,100
sal put yous two up to this, right?

297
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,100
sal's the one brought the feds in in the first place, trying to shut me down.

298
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,500
you should be looking at him. sal had an alibi for last night.

299
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,500
what about you, mr. carbone?

300
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,600
i'm at home in bed. you could ask my wife.

301
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,900
and that reporter, all he asked me about was pizza.

302
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,500
that guy is guilty of something.

303
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,400
not until we have proof.

304
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,200
hey, ryan. any luck on where our victim was last night?

305
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,800
well, we're still waiting for info from his bank, but i got his luds.

306
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,500
nothing last night, and only a few calls to his editor in the previous days.

307
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,300
a reporter chasing down a story?

308
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,900
no, there should be dozens of calls. well, maybe he was making them from wherever he was staying.

309
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,800
any leads on the girl in the photo? no.

310
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,200
but i got in touch with burns' ex in portland.

311
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,700
they hadn't seen each other in years. yo. pay dirt.

312
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,500
i canvassed burns' building. at first, it was all,

313
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,600
"he's so quiet. he just keeps to himself."

314
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,300
but this other neighbor who just came home said that she saw burns and another guy having

315
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,700
a knock-down, drag-out yelling match just before he left.

316
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,600
about what? all she remembers is the other guy yelling,

317
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,400
"if you try to print that, i swear to god, i'll kill ya!"

318
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,000
did you get a description?

319
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,600
and i'll give you a hint. he's authentic...

320
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,500
and terrific.

321
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
so me and burns argued? so what?

322
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,400
it's a free country.

323
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,300
free speech doesn't cover death threats, mr. sabalini.

324
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,000
or murder. i told you, i was home last night.

325
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,700
yeah, you did, but your wife tells us a different story.

326
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,800
it seems she remembers you sneaking out before midnight,

327
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,400
after you thought she was asleep.

328
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,800
she told us you were off to see "that whore mistress of his over in flatbush,"

329
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
and when she confronted you about it this morning,

330
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,400
you told her that you went into the city because the store alarm was going off.

331
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,200
we checked. it wasn't.

332
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,900
so who were you lying to, luca, me or your wife?

333
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,900
my wife.

334
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,100
i was with angie last night. you can ask her.

335
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,000
i could. but it doesn't mean i'm gonna believe her.

336
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,900
what were you and burns fighting about?

337
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,500
he was gonna write something about me, destroy everything i've worked for.

338
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,600
i had to stop him. and what was he gonna write?

339
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,000
about my pizza.

340
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,000
about what makes my fat-free pizza taste so good.

341
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,300
it's made with real cheese.

342
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,100
there's nothing fat-free about it.

343
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,700
you were gonna kill for that? it's an expression.

344
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,200
besides, burns called me last night.

345
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,400
he said he'd consider not running it if i'd do him a favor. what favor?

346
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,900
hey, he didn't say what.

347
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,100
he was supposed to stop by today to talk about it.

348
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,300
you said that he called you yesterday? from where?

349
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,900
okay, got it. the incoming call on his cell

350
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,000
was from the hotel beta in midtown.

351
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,400
all right, let's go.

352
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,500
thanks.

353
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,400
paid in cash, signed in under the name melville.

354
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,600
this guy's definitely flying under the radar.

355
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,100
castle, there's his computer.

356
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,500
okay.

357
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,200
"new york's authentic terrific pizza wars."

358
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,500
sharp narration,

359
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,000
delicate prose.

360
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,300
this is not an expos?

361
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,900
it's a puff piece. well, i can practically smell the garlic,

362
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,300
but there's nothing in there that's about anything heavier than pizza.

363
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,500
or what got him killed. mm, his most recent notes.

364
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,000
pizza, recipes,

365
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,900
inter--

366
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,000
what? look at that.

367
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,400
4/3 @10pm

368
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,600
that's last night.

369
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,200
he was meeting with someone.

370
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,700
someone from that phone number, just before he was killed.

371
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,600
i'm gonna run that down. you have an app for that?

372
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,400
yeah, nypd issue. we just got it.

373
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,600
can i-- whoa.

374
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,100
fine.

375
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,100
then you don't get to play my "angry birds."

376
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,000
and they just came out with a new one.

377
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,000
"johnny farrell, swede anderson."

378
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,800
how do i know those names?

379
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,200
i don't know, but recognize this person?

380
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,500
that's the woman from burns' wallet.

381
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,200
bingo. monica wyatt.

382
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,600
and if she met with him last night,

383
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,400
she might be the last person to have seen him alive. i wonder if they went out for pizza.

384
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,600
little upscale for the pizza world. unless she's a middle man.

385
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,900
for the money laundering operation?

386
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,400
she transfers the assets out of country into swiss bank accounts using the names

387
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,500
johnny farrell and swede anderson.

388
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,600
or she's just a real estate agent as she claims to be.

389
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,700
oh, that's just her cover to avoid scrutiny with the feds.

390
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,000
you had a lot of imaginary friends growing up, didn't you? still do.

391
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,100
hi. can i help you?

392
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,800
i can't believe he still had this.

393
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,800
he actually took this on our first date.

394
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,100
and how long were the two of you together?

395
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,300
just a couple of months,

396
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,000
but god, this had to be three years ago.

397
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,800
i saw him once or twice after his daughter's accident.

398
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,100
he was different. it's like he just drifted away.

399
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,600
what made you see him last night?

400
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,700
i-i didn't see him last night.

401
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,800
well, according to his notes, he met up with you at 10:00 p.m.

402
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,800
well, that wasn't a meeting. that was a date.

403
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,500
but... he didn't show.  you said you hadn't seen him in years.

404
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,500
how did you end up on a date? we bumped into each other in the street the other day.

405
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,800
it was weird because...

406
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,800
it was in the village, and i never go down there,

407
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,100
and he said he doesn't go down there either,

408
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:58,000
but he was working on a story. did he tell you what it was about?

409
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,800
no.

410
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,900
how did he seem-- uh, worried, distressed?

411
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:09,100
he seemed like himself, like his old self,

412
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,800
like he was on to something.

413
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,900
he'd just come from the hall of records,

414
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,900
and whatever he found, he was really excited about.

415
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,300
the hall of records? yeah.

416
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,300
ms. wyatt, do the names johnny farrell or swede anderson mean anything to you?

417
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,000
i can't say they do.

418
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,700
monica wyatt... checks.

419
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,000
her brokerage house says that she complains

420
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,900
about commissions more than they'd like, but other than that, she's clean.

421
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,000
you find anything else in there? nope. the rest is just pizza.

422
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,900
i just got through burns' financials.

423
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,300
any activity last night? uh, yeah. something odd.

424
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,700
at 11:15 p.m., he used his atm card.

425
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:56,200
where? a not-so-good neighborhood about 15 blocks away from authentic nick's.

426
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,000
but here's the odd part--he never finished the transaction.

427
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,100
you mean he canceled it.

428
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,600
no, no, he never finished it. he popped in his atm card,

429
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,000
but then after about a minute of inactivity,

430
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,400
it ate his card. it's almost as if--

431
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,700
something happened. get atm surveillance. let's find out what.

432
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,200
i'm gonna go to the hall of records tomorrow morning

433
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,200
and see if we can figure out what burns was up to.

434
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,500
well... what happened?

435
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,000
alexis decided to crash lauren's party,

436
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
against our better judgment...

437
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,300
and i take it that the, uh, party crashing didn't go so well?

438
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,400
none of this would've happened if lauren wasn't

439
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,000
the most conniving bitch in the entire world. whoa.

440
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,700
it's warranted. when the band was performing,

441
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,800
lauren brought ashley up on stage with her,

442
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,000
and she kissed him in front of everyone.

443
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,700
bitch. how could she do this to me, to ashley?

444
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,100
what did ashley do? he was mortified. he ran off stage, and we left.

445
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,000
i mean, he was apologizing a thousand times and said

446
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,300
he had no idea that she was gonna do that.

447
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,000
it's like she's been trying to break us up this whole time.

448
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
it's been her master plan. well, she didn't succeed, darling.

449
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,500
you and ashley are stronger than ever, and--and she looks like a fool.

450
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,400
yeah, i wish that were true.

451
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,700
but according to the internet, ashley cheated on me.

452
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,800
she already posted the pictures of them kissing all over her web site.

453
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,300
it's a nightmare.

454
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,500
where's beckett?

455
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,800
oh, hall of records,

456
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,800
tracking down what burns was looking for. great.

457
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:36,400
listen... if i gave you a web site,

458
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:41,000
could you have your friends at tech hack into it and take some pictures down?

459
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,000
did someone find naked pictures of you again?

460
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,800
<i>no, it's not me. it's alexis.</i>

461
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,700
<i>it's for alexis.</i>

462
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,000
uh, this just got awkward. what's this about?

463
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,800
okay.

464
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,100
mean girl at school kiss-ambushed alexis' boyfriend

465
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,500
and then posted the photographic proof on her web site.

466
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,100
alexis... very upset. mm-hmm.

467
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:08,300
i-i could have my friend tony take care of it, you know, off the record. thanks.

468
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,100
and, uh, no need to mention this to beckett.

469
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,800
you know how she gets with these things.

470
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,800
yeah.

471
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,300
things like abusing police resources for your own personal agenda?

472
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,600
what?

473
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,000
that's ridic--no, you don't-- ab--no, that's--that's...

474
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,300
so, uh, what'd you find? anything on nicks?

475
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,500
uh, not exactly.

476
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,600
burns requested files relating to the 2003 murder

477
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,100
of a drug trafficker named harley romero,

478
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,600
a.k.a. harley playful, also known as handsome harley.

479
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,400
judging from those photos, i'm guessing it was ironic. what's a guy who's been dead for eight years

480
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,000
have to do with pizza? mm. hey, ryan.

481
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,100
yep. did you get a chance to look into all the nicks and their employees?

482
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,900
oh, yeah, just going over the reports right now.

483
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,100
mostly minor stuff. any drug charges?

484
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,000
no, nothing about drugs. romero? you think maybe

485
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,900
it's some kind of mafia tie-in with authentic nick's? according to the file, there's no connection

486
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,600
to any of the families. someone didn't like him.

487
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,900
it says here he was shot a dozen times, dumped in an oil drum, and set on fire.

488
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,800
yeah, word on the street was that a dealer killed him

489
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,200
over a turf war. so why was burns looking at him?

490
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:14,900
yo. bank just sent over surveillance footage. you guys gotta see this.

491
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,400
looks like he's running from something.

492
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,700
he's running from something all right. watch this.

493
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,100
he knows he's on camera. he's trying to tell us something.

494
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,300
he's writing it.

495
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,000
whoa! okay, take it back.

496
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,500
and freeze there.

497
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,200
he's got a knife.

498
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,500
he was trying to send us a message,

499
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,000
but he recorded his own murder. close up on the face.

500
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,700
castle, look at that face.

501
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,300
that's harley romero.

502
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,100
and he is very much alive.

503
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,400
why would he stop to write a message?

504
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,800
why not just keep running? well, that street empties on to a blind alley.

505
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,200
maybe burns thought he couldn't get away. any idea what he was writing there?

506
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,900
we're seeing if tech can enhance the image,

507
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,100
but we found no connection between this harley and the pizza joints.

508
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,700
maybe pizza has nothing to do with it.

509
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,800
maybe burns knew harley from an old story.

510
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,100
no. i-i don't recognize him at all.

511
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,100
did burns ever mention the name harley in any of his stories?

512
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,900
never. when this guy supposedly died,

513
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,500
gordon was embedded with the 2nd marine division in gulf ii.

514
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,700
mr. shaw, do the names johnny farrell or swede anderson mean anything to you?

515
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,400
yeah. they do.

516
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,400
they're both characters from old film noir movies. right.

517
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,300
uh, johnny farrell from the movie "gilda,"

518
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,600
glenn ford's character, and burt lancaster played

519
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,900
swede anderson in "the killers." and why would these two names be important?

520
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,800
this guy--harley--what kind of drugs was he dealing?

521
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,400
heroin, why?

522
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
because the only heroin story burns ever chased was the one that he could never finish,

523
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,400
about a high-end distribution ring in new york

524
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,100
that sets up shop inside legitimate businesses.

525
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,900
when someone needed product, they'd use a code word.

526
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,600
their code happens to be names of characters from film noir.

527
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,800
it's that story that destroyed him.

528
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,100
why? because of the guy who was behind the ring.

529
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,000
it was cavallo.

530
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,900
gordon burns was gunning for the prince of darkness himself.

531
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,100
who's cavallo?

532
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:28,200
it's a-a street myth, an urban legend.

533
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,500
anytime a dealer gets whacked, people always say it's cavallo,

534
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,700
but he's not even real.  oh, cavallo's real.

535
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,000
come on, shaw. we've all heard the scary stories.

536
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,700
i didn't. so the story goes that cavallo was mentored

537
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,900
by this badass colombian drug lord-- khazi "the conqueror"--

538
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,600
and eventually he put a bullet to his boss' head,

539
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,200
slit all of his kids' throats, and took over the operation.

540
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
but i mean, it's a fairy tale.

541
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,800
not to burns. not to his daughter.

542
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,700
burns told me he had a contact that was getting him close to cavallo.

543
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,100
the next day, he and his daughter are crossing the street, this car appears out of nowhere.

544
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,600
when he came to, his leg was shattered.

545
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,400
nina was 20 feet away, bleeding out, and he couldn't even crawl over to hold her,

546
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,800
so don't you tell me cavallo isn't real.

547
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,000
it sounds like burns was ahab and cavallo, his white whale.

548
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,400
well, he did sign in to the hotel as melville.

549
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,800
you know, it's that kind of sly humor that burns was known for.

550
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,400
and while i am loathe to profile,

551
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,700
the name cavallo--also the italian word for "horse"--

552
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,800
might suggest a link back to the nicks.

553
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,400
hey, ryan. when you were in narcotics,

554
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,600
when was the first time you heard the name cavallo? i don't know. probably around, uh, '03.

555
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,300
around all that time all those dealers were getting whacked. well, that's right when harley was killed.

556
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:45,100
so harley stages his own death,
brutally murders his competition,

557
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,500
and then starts a whisper campaign on the streets

558
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,200
about the new dark prince of heroin...

559
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,200
and a legend is born.  yo.

560
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,500
tech was able to blow up and enhance that atm video.

561
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,600
they're sending it up now.

562
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,600
i still can't make it out. mnh-mnh.

563
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,600
run it again.

564
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,000
can you flip it and slow it down?

565
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,100
yeah. what are you doing?

566
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,000
what i do best--writing.

567
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,900
okay, 3...

568
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,200
6... s...

569
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,900
that could be a 5. okay, s or a 5...

570
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,500
w-1-2... 7?

571
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,400
it's an address.

572
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,100
b... a... s? basement.

573
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:27,400
365 west 127th street, in the basement.

574
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,100
that's three blocks from the atm.

575
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,900
police! nobody move!

576
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,100
nypd!

577
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,200
room's clear. somebody moved out in a hurry.

578
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,500
coffee grinders for cutting. envelopes for packaging.

579
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,000
all the earmarks of a well-organized heroin processing house.

580
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,100
get c.s.u. in here. sweep the area.

581
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,400
if anyone saw anything, i want to know.

582
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,500
looks like your ahab found his white whale.

583
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,000
and it took him under.

584
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,000
hi, dad. bye, dad.

585
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
what, no kiss?

586
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,300
alexis, what happened to your face? nothing.

587
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,200
that's not nothing. what happened?

588
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,300
lauren. she cornered me in the bathrooms at school,

589
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:16,400
said i ruined her party, and then she accused me of hacking into her account

590
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,300
<i>and deleting those pictures she took, as if.  and--and then what happened?</i>

591
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:24,700
well, i called her a backstabber, and then she scratched me, so i...

592
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,900
you what? i punched her.

593
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,600
ah. what were you thinking?

594
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,000
i don't know. this isn't me.

595
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,800
i don't crash parties. i don't get in fights with people.

596
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,600
i... but, dad, she made me so angry.

597
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,600
i know she did, but retaliation is not the answer.

598
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,600
you get her back, she gets you back, and then one day, one of you ends up dead in a pizza oven.

599
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,200
is that what you want? look, the point is,

600
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,100
you're gonna have to deal with mean, backstabbing girls

601
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:52,700
your whole life.

602
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:57,400
you need to learn to be smart enough to rise above.

603
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,700
okay?

604
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,200
okay.

605
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,900
come here.

606
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,100
did you kick her ass? i kinda did.

607
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,200
good girl.

608
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,200
i should've gotten involved much earlier.

609
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,000
why? lauren would've still found a way
to make alexis' life miserable.

610
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,200
lauren isn't a criminal mastermind.

611
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,800
she's just a teenager. ah, castle,

612
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,500
never underestimate the power of a woman on a mission.

613
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,300
no, i don't. and i have the alimony checks to prove it.

614
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,500
beckett, just hung up with the lab.

615
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,500
that trace heroin from the processing house?

616
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,100
it matches most of the dope being peddled on the lower east.

617
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,100
any word on this harley? sir, if half of the rumors about this guy are true,

618
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,900
then he's got snitches all over the force,

619
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,700
so i was thinking of holding off on an a.p.b. until we knew more.

620
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,100
keep me posted. yes, sir.

621
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,600
you know, shaw said that cavallo is using legitimate businesses to distribute product.

622
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,600
you think he could be operating out of one of the nicks'?

623
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,800
yeah, but i can't get a warrant for a fishing expedition.

624
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,500
we're gonna have to have something more concrete. yo.

625
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,400
c.s.u. swept the tenement basement top to bottom, there's not one print anywhere.

626
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,900
any witnesses see burns getting chased?

627
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,100
in that neighborhood, nobody sees nothing.

628
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:08,800
but one of our uniforms did find this in a storm drain near the atm.

629
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,200
burns' phone? does it strike anyone else as strange

630
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,900
that a seasoned war correspondent would suddenly develop butterfingers,

631
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,500
drop his phone while being chased? you think he purposefully dropped it?

632
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,900
so that whoever was chasing him wouldn't get his phone? or what was on it.

633
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:26,400
the last call he made was 9-1-1 
and he didn't press send.

634
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,900
outside the drug lab. he was casing the joint.

635
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,500
that's monica. she's involved.

636
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,000
monica wyatt, nypd! open up!

637
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,000
monica!

638
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,700
step back.

639
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,300
nypd!

640
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,800
monica.

641
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,100
he--he tried to kill me.

642
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,200
window.  let's go.

643
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,400
monica, who did this to you? if i tell you, then i'm dead.

644
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,200
i think we're past that. who did it?

645
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,000
cavallo.

646
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,700
i wasn't lying before about gordon.

647
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,200
we did date years ago, and i thought it was real,

648
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,300
but he was just doing it to get close to cavallo.

649
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,200
i never imagined that...

650
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,200
what's a midtown real estate agent doing mixed up with heroin dealers?

651
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,900
their labs are mobile.

652
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:43,100
they need new places for their processing centers every month or so, and i had

653
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,100
access to all the information that they needed.

654
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:48,300
look... this is not who i am.

655
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,600
i mean, i never meant for anything... how did it start?

656
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,400
i had some problems

657
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,900
a few years back.

658
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,300
i owed some people money.

659
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:03,800
a man came to me and he told me that he could make it all better.

660
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,400
i just... had to do a favor for him every now and then.

661
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,200
and at the time, that actually sounded harmless.

662
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,200
but this man knew things about me.

663
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,700
i mean things that nobody could possibly know.

664
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,100
and i wanted to leave,

665
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,800
but... after what happened to gordon's kid, i just...

666
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,400
gordon found me a couple of days ago.

667
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,200
he said he needed my help.

668
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,400
he said that i could end this, and that we both could be free.

669
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,900
all i had to do was take him there.

670
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,600
and now gordon is dead,
and i am next.

671
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,600
cavallo--who is he?

672
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,300
i've never seen him. didn't he just try to kill you?

673
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:48,100
if i knew who cavallo was, don't you think i would've told gordon?

674
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,400
i've only ever dealt with cavallo's right-hand man before.

675
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,200
that's who was here trying to kill me. and who is this man?

676
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,600
his name is harley.

677
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,000
him?

678
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,900
harley is cavallo.

679
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,400
so cavallo is hiding right under everyone's noses.

680
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,400
how do i find him? he finds me.

681
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,400
monica, gordon was right.

682
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,300
we can end this, but we need your help.

683
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:23,600
we believe that cavallo is trafficking drugs through a pizzeria, but we need to know which one.

684
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,500
i'm sorry. i don't know which one.

685
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,900
yo. we covered the whole area.

686
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,600
whoever he was, he's in the wind.

687
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,000
all right. why don't you guys take monica to the e.r.?

688
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,700
get her checked, and then get her over to narcotics.

689
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,200
let them talk to her. one last question--

690
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,600
johnny farrell and swede anderson?

691
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,100
that's how gordon got on to this story in the first place.

692
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:52,200
he heard somebody at one of the pizza joints using those names, and he knew it was cavallo's code.

693
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,300
those were last week's names. do you know this week's names?

694
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,500
no, but gordon said they were from his favorite film--

695
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,900
"the maltese falcon."

696
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,000
you're a sneak. what? i'm a what?

697
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,900
i don't care if these guys could've recognized you.

698
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,400
you hold 'em much longer, there's gonna be another murder on our hands.

699
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,100
relax. we're almost done.

700
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,700
we got two nicks down, two to go.

701
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:20,200
okay. call you in a bit. i wonder if i should've used sydney greenstreet's character-- kasper gutman.

702
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,400
now there's a guy who loved his pizza.

703
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,500
well, we already put our money down on bogie, so let's just play this through.

704
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,100
slice?

705
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,200
uh, no, a pickup actually for spade--

706
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,500
sam spade.

707
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,600
of course, mr. spade.

708
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,900
we have your order right here.

709
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,600
here you go, mr. spade.

710
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,800
we put it on your tab.

711
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,000
thank you.

712
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,900
winner, winner, pizza dinner.

713
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:06,900
possession, trafficking, conspiracy to distribute-- that right there

714
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:11,600
is 30 years, easy, sal-- 30 terrific authentic years.

715
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,800
it's life if you're an accessory to burns' murder.

716
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,300
no, i had nothing to do with that. i swear. you swear? so what are you trying to tell me?

717
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,800
are you trying to tell me that harley had the idea to put the body in your rival's oven?

718
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,200
you're a pizza man, sal.

719
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,600
body in an oven sounds more like you're speed.

720
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,700
<i>no. no, no, no, it was him. it was all him.</i>

721
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,000
so what, now you're a victim?

722
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
look, my place was struggling.

723
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,300
ame to me, he said the man that he worked for could help.

724
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,900
all i had to do was let him use my shop for a couple of months,

725
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,000
then he would make...

726
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,300
my dream come true.

727
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,800
your dream?

728
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,500
yeah, he said, uh, after it was over,

729
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,600
the man he worked for would, uh...

730
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,100
b-burn down authentic nick's.

731
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,300
this ain't me.

732
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,100
i never even smoked a joint.

733
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,000
but all those other nicks, the stuff they were doing,

734
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,100
it was driving me crazy. how did burns' body get in the oven?

735
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,400
harley called me that night,

736
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,700
said he needed to throw something in my oven overnight.

737
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,800
he didn't say what it was.

738
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,000
yeah, but you knew it wasn't a tray of lasagna. and i said no way.

739
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,700
no way. i never signed up for cremation services.

740
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,700
i never dreamed what i turned away

741
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,700
would end up in ralph carbone's oven.

742
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,900
you want our help, sal?

743
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,800
you want me to put in a good word with the d.a.? yeah.

744
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,400
then help me find him. help me find cavallo.

745
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,500
you can't find him.

746
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,600
he finds you.

747
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,400
that's not helping me, sal. you don't get it.

748
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,500
when i run out of product, i call him.

749
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,700
he delivers.

750
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,700
make the call.

751
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,300
harley romero, a.k.a., the legendary cavallo.

752
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,300
you won't talk without a lawyer.

753
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,700
with the evidence from the atm video and sal's testimony, he's gonna need one.

754
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,100
you know, it's brilliant when you think about it.

755
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,400
the unassuming middle man does all the dirty work

756
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,700
while everyone stays busy looking for the menacing mythic overlord...

757
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,600
who no one ever meets because he's not really real.

758
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,400
well, real or not, he's going away for a long time. good work.

759
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,600
narcotics is finished with monica wyatt.

760
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,000
she cooperated fully. okay, process her out.

761
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,900
and put a patrol car outside her building for the next few nights, just in case cavallo has friends.

762
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,000
what's up?

763
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,600
i was just thinking about burns, how close he came to catching

764
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,700
the guy who killed his daughter only to come up short.

765
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,700
well, if it's any consolation, there's justice now.

766
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,000
yeah. you know what's still bugging me? hmm?

767
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,500
the guy is running for his life, why does he ditch his phone?

768
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,400
well, he probably knew that he was gonna get killed,

769
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,300
and he wanted at least someone to know the truth. what truth?

770
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,700
it wasn't like there was a picture of cavallo on it. no, you're right.

771
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:15,400
the only person he had a picture of was...

772
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,200
just a few more questions, ms. wyatt.

773
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,200
i have been waiting over an hour.

774
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,800
you know the funny thing about this case is that

775
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,700
nobody is who they claim to be, not even you.

776
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:42,700
monica wyatt--it says here you moved to new york in 2002 from l.a.

777
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,400
yeah, so?

778
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,700
so we did a little bit of digging, and the only monica wyatt that we found

779
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:53,100
was a heroin addict who was shot point-blank

780
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,100
and then dumped in the l.a. river.

781
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,900
six months later,

782
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:00,300
word of a new and brutal kingpin started sweeping the streets.

783
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,800
and you're saying that's me?

784
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,300
i'm a real estate agent. have you seen my apartment?

785
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,600
oh, yeah, we saw that one.

786
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,400
but all of the other ones can only be previewed online.

787
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,100
what are you talking about?

788
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,900
your apartment sales to walter neff, frank chambers,

789
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:20,100
richard harland--they're all characters from noir films.

790
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,300
they aren't real.

791
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,200
you made millions in heroin holdings,

792
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,200
which you turned into millions in real estate holdings,

793
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:32,000
all clean. all the while, perpetuating the myth of cavallo.

794
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,100
gordon didn't die chasing a myth.

795
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,100
oh, yeah, gordon.

796
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,600
well, there's something that you didn't completely lie about.

797
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,500
you did meet him a couple of years ago,

798
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,900
but not as a boyfriend.

799
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:45,400
he was a pain-in-the-ass reporter that just kept getting a little too close.

800
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,100
until a car came out of nowhere and killed his daughter.

801
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,500
that got him out of your hair for a couple of years,

802
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,600
but then he caught your scent again at nick's pizza.

803
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,300
and that forced you to get rid of him permanently.

804
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,300
and then you fed us harley, the sacrificial lamb, to throw us off your trail.

805
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,500
harley attacked me.

806
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,200
oh, yeah, and then he managed to run down the fire escape

807
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:11,000
with such incredible speed that two of new york's finest detectives

808
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,900
were incapable of seeing him, never mind catching him.

809
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,400
beating yourself up...

810
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,200
was a nice touch.

811
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,400
you know what i just realized?

812
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,300
all those noir films that cavallo draws his names from,

813
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,900
they all have one thing in common--

814
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,000
a femme fatale.

815
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,800
i'd like my lawyer now.

816
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,600
ah, great. you're still up.

817
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,400
couldn't sleep if i wanted to.

818
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,800
that makes two of us.

819
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,900
is that from stefano's? mm-hmm.

820
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,200
you went all the way across the bridge for a pizza?

821
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,000
not for just anyone.

822
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,800
fresh basil and sausage.

823
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,500
any updates on, uh...

824
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,800
i called a mediation session with our school counselor today.

825
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:10,500
and it turns out, lauren was just jealous of all the time i was spending with ashley.

826
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:14,200
she thought i had ditched our friendship. so what'd you do?

827
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,100
we hugged it out.

828
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,700
and now you're friends again?

829
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,400
it's too soon to tell.

830
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,100
hurts like these...

831
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,000
take time to heal. time...

832
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,200
and pizza.

833
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,300
ooh, look at that.

834
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,000
cheers.

00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,000
来吧 我给你看看我的地盘?

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,300
我一定要发到推特上去

3
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,900
没人会相信我跟"棒尼克"在一起

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,900
是"真尼克"

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,900
不是"棒" 好吧?

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,000
我是说 我们才是最好的

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,500
我猜也是

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,300
真香哪

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,300
确实 很香

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,700
有人在吗?

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,200
老爸?

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,300
闻起来像排骨 是烧烤味的披萨吗?

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,100
没 我们才不做烧烤味的披萨呢 好吧?

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,600
只有像"棒尼克"这种冒牌货才这么花哨

19
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,300
你最喜欢的哦

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,400
你吃吧 我不饿

21
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,100
你可从来不会拒绝火鸡培根的

22
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,500
- 怎么了?
- 没事

23
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,500
肯定有事

24
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,100
别逼我拿钳子来逼供哦

25
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,800
都逗不笑了啊 这事不小啊

26
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,900
是Lauren的生日派对 我不去了

27
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,800
什么 你叨叨了这个派对几个星期

28
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,700
- "这肯定会是这个世纪最好的派对"
- 昨天Lauren出现在我面前

29
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,900
当着大伙的面 告诉我 我被踢出受邀之列了

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,700
- 太丢脸了
- Lauren为什么会做这种事呢?

31
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,900
- 她是你最好的朋友啊
- 她曾是我最好的朋友

32
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,600
我也不知道她为什么要这样

33
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,300
她也不跟我说话 Ashley还在受邀之列

34
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,300
其他人也是

35
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,600
- 就好像我被驱逐出了社交圈的 
- 那你不去的话 Ashley也不会去的

36
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,700
只是我被逐出来 不意味着他也要被逐出来啊

37
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,500
那我觉得你该开个竞争派对

38
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,600
- 邀请你所有的朋友来这个 不去那个
- 她的派对就在今晚 她还有一个现场乐队表演

39
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,600
- 我可比不上那个
- 那我跟Lauren的妈妈打电话 我--

40
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,600
你在开玩笑吧?

41
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,400
这样 我既被驱出社交圈 又成了个告密者?

42
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,400
我17岁了 我能自己应付这事的

43
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,100
只是 我身体在不停叫嚣

44
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,800
催促我去保护她

45
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,200
是啊 但事关少男少女事

46
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,900
你也不能保护不了她啊 在Alexis的一生中

47
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,300
她得应对各种暗箭伤人

48
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,800
但她有足够的聪明机智去应对

49
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,800
我不晓得啦 她看起来像是准备去杀人似的

50
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,400
说到杀人

51
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,500
我还以为东边角上的那家"棒尼克"才是最好的呢

52
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,700
不 那家是"好棒真尼克"

53
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,800
- 这家就叫"真尼克" 
- 不是"棒"吗?

54
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,800
没 只有"真" 而且也不是"真棒好尼克"

55
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,000
- 那是街对面的那家
- 有什么区别吗?

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,900
区别就在于 这家烤箱里有具死尸

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,400
好吧

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,500
- 那还真是... 
- 烤得很熟啊

59
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,900
也许得再烤几个小时吧 老天眷顾啊 
他还没烤得太熟

60
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,100
男性 40多岁 我现在能给你的他的个人信息就这么多

61
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,800
根据烤箱的设置和尸体的核心温度

62
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,800
- 我得说他是在凌晨2点以后被放进来的
- 我还是得问一句 他的死因是?

63
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,200
不是烤死的 贯胸的一道刺伤

64
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,900
说明他被放进来时已经死了

65
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,000
没有硬闯的痕迹

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,300
但我们也在同样排查门把手上的指纹

67
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,100
好吧 也查查烤箱上的指纹

68
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,700
- 谁发现的尸体
- 这里的少东家

69
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,800
- 不可思议
- 给我他的号码

70
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,000
真的哈 可不是棒的哦

71
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,500
不 我不知道他是谁

72
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,300
我是说 我打开烤箱 砰的一声 他就倒在那儿

73
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,400
- 昨晚谁是最晚离开的人
- 我和我老爸

74
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,600
我们大概11点的样子关店

75
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,100
接着我去了Kaydar酒吧

76
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,800
遇见了个女人 接着我们就回来这儿

77
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,700
来 来"尝尝鲜"

78
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,600
那时几点?

79
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,100
我也不确定 4:30吧

80
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,800
- 你那位女朋友在哪儿呢
- 她吐了好久

81
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,600
所以医务人员就让她住院了

82
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,400
不过我留了她的电话号码

83
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,000
我看你俩不会有第二次约会了

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,600
- 是啊 你说得对
- 我很抱歉

85
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,400
我需要你家雇员们的清单

86
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,300
- 还有送货员的 
- 你不是觉得烤箱里的是我们的人吧?

87
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,500
你提供给我这份清单 我就开始打电话确认

88
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,300
哦 我简直不敢相信

89
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,400
开玩笑吧

90
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,800
老爸 这些是警察

91
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,300
你一定是真尼克了

92
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,100
- 唯一货真价实的
- 尼克?

93
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,400
我看到业主的名字叫Ralph Carbone

94
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,300
- 是 就是我 不过每个人都叫我尼克
- 为什么?

95
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,100
因为每个人都这么叫我

96
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,400
我不敢相信 这些混蛋们居然放了一具尸体到我的烤箱里

97
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,600
- 抱歉 Carbone先生 你知道是谁干的吗
- 没错 我知道

98
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,300
我敢肯定是那个混球

99
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,600
"好棒真尼克"?

100
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,700
Sal Malavolta 他在对面开了自己那家烂店之前

101
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,800
曾为我工作了很多年 他还偷走了我的配方

102
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,600
- 肯定是Sal干的 跟那俩一起
- 另外两个?

103
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,200
- 是啊 那两个秃鹫 
- 棒尼克?

104
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,500
Vinnie Delfino 还有那边那个杂碎

105
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,600
- 真棒好尼克
- Luca Sabalini

106
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,100
这三个人都tm的是小偷

107
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,800
盗用我们的名号 他们都不叫尼克

108
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,100
- 我才是真正唯一的尼克 
- 可你的名字叫Ralph

109
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,200
就是啊 他们早就想把我挤出披萨生意

110
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,000
现在居然干出这种事 现在谁还会来买我的披萨呢 啊?

111
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,100
嘿 嘿 你们高兴啦 我没生意可做啦!

112
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,500
Carbone先生 你怎么会认为是这三人中的一个干的这事呢?

113
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,800
几周前 他们中的一个

114
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,700
偷偷放了一加仑的肥皂水进我的秘制酱汁里

115
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,000
让我家一整天都被退货

116
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,500
听着 我也许是以牙还牙了 也许是没有

117
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,800
但如果我做了 他们就放了具医用死尸进我的烤箱里

118
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,100
这是报复

119
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,100
Carbone先生 这不是具医用尸体

120
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,000
你是什么意思 他们不是从什么医学院里偷来的吗

121
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,900
不 这不是什么恶作剧 这是件谋杀事件

122
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,700
我们打通了他们所有雇员的电话

123
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,100
- 没人失踪 
- Lanie 找到身份的可能有多大?

124
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,256
找指纹是没啥指望了
 我们也许得等失踪人口报告和牙医记录出来

125
00:05:53,306 --> 00:05:56,100
我们也开始查问昨晚有没人看到什么

126
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,000
好的 开始跟所有雇员做笔录 特别是那些有钥匙的

127
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,200
我想知道他们昨晚都在做什么

128
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,900
- 我们难道不该查查其他几个尼克吗
- 兄弟 你不会真觉得

129
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,800
这事关什么披萨竞争吧?

130
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,700
为了争谁是纽约最好的披萨哎 刀光剑影哦?

131
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,500
Carbone说过他们曾经溜进店里

132
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,200
如果我们在找那些有钥匙的人

133
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:17,000
- 那我们也该查查他们 
- 他是对的 你知道吗 这座城市的披萨生意确实竞争激烈

134
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,200
- 好吧 你去找他们谈
- 什么 我?

135
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,200
别啊 我 不是吧

136
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,500
你知道 咱得承认 一个披萨烤箱--

137
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,400
是解决一具尸体的好办法

138
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,300
在我的书《死于黄昏》中 我让那个精神病法律助手

139
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,800
杀掉她那个爱骂人的老板 
然后把他放进一个烧陶器的窑

140
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,000
他在几个小时之内就消解成一堆尘土

141
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,500
当然 你已经知道了 对吧?

142
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,900
- 咱们的凶手大概也是这么计划的吧 可惜少东家出现了
- 我没听错吧?

143
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,000
你们在"棒尼克"的烤箱里发现了一具尸体?

144
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,500
- "真尼克"
- "真尼克"?

145
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,900
哦 谢天谢地 老婆大人超喜欢棒尼克

146
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,900
我都不忍心告诉她现在有"烤全人"口味的了
[注：full-bodied意为浓香 此处为本义]

147
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,700
哦 说得很妙啊 我喜欢

148
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,500
我们查过了所有"真尼克"的雇员

149
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,316
他们都有不在现场证据 
但我发现另一家"尼克"的雇员们就有些猫腻

150
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:07,500
犯罪投诉?

151
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,685
是啊 这些年来 两家尼克互相投诉

152
00:07:11,704 --> 00:07:13,300
板砖砸前窗啊

153
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,300
划外卖车轮胎啊 丢便便燃烧弹啊

154
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,400
- 谢谢
- 好的

155
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,600
就这样算了?

156
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,800
便便燃烧弹 秘制酱汁里放肥皂?

157
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,800
Castle 你真觉得

158
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,400
这些人突然从恶作剧升级到谋杀了吗?

159
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,500
Beckett

160
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,900
正如我预料的一样 身体被毁严重 无法取得任何指纹

161
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,300
但我还是找到了这个

162
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,800
你看本该是胫骨的这个位置?

163
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,300
这些是钛板

164
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,200
所以机器人杀手从未来派过来 
抵抗分子们截获了他的坐标

165
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:51,000
- 为了拯救人类 把他重调到一个披萨烤箱里
- 这些钛板有序列号

166
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,800
我在手术数据库里查了下

167
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,300
找到了此人身份

168
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,900
Gordon Burns

169
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,400
- Gordon Burns?
- 没错 是Burns[注:姓即为"燃烧"之意]

170
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,800
好吧 讲个笑话吧 别憋着呢

171
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,800
- Gordon Burns 是《纽约记事报》的那个吗
- 你知道他?

172
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,500
我不认识他 他是个记者

173
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,900
我以前很喜欢他的报道

174
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,500
你还在尸体上发现其他线索吗?

175
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,700
一个熔化了的皮带手机扣 但没发现手机

176
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
犯罪现场也没发现

177
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,900
这是他的钱包

178
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,800
几张信用卡

179
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,000
驾证....都化了

180
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
女朋友还是妻子?

181
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,100
资料中显示Burns离婚了 没有近亲

182
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,700
他是一名战地记者 一名调查记者

183
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,900
他跑到披萨烤箱里去干什么呢?

184
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,200
也许他的编辑知道

185
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,000
我们是朋友 所以我一当上报纸编辑
 他就是我雇的第一个人

186
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,800
他写的这些报道 肯定让他一直如履薄冰吧

187
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,900
- 停了好多年了 他早已不干那类报道了 
- 为什么呢?

188
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,900
他的孩子死于一场事故

189
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:59,300
她才10岁 之后 他终于将他一生至爱的事业束之高阁

190
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,200
我们看到你仍然在付他工资

191
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,700
他偶尔为我们的生活版写一些人情小故事

192
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:09,700
大材小用 但能让他付起房租 交得起保险

193
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,900
Shaw先生 他最近在准备写东西吗?

194
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,600
- 只有一篇我上周交给他的小故事 
- 关于什么的?

195
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,900
披萨战争 你知道的 那些真与棒之间的战斗

196
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,000
争谁是最好的披萨店这种事

197
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,500
那不是阿富汗 但Gordon就是Gordon

198
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,600
他前几天给我打电话说 

199
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,400
- 这事比我想的要大 
- 怎么个大法?

200
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,700
他没说 但我想 就是个披萨战呗

201
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,700
- 再大能大到哪儿去呢
- 大到可以去杀人

202
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,500
让我们再深入调查下这些尼克披萨们吧
棒啊 真啊还有其他家的

203
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,213
也查查他们所有雇员的背景

204
00:09:57,313 --> 00:09:59,400
你知道吗 这家伙从阿富汗

205
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,900
进军伊拉克 甚至天*安*门事件中都幸存下来了
却死于一场披萨战?

206
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,000
就像警察一样 兄弟

207
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,300
你经历了十几场黑帮交火

208
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,100
最后却在抄超速罚单时

209
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,000
被车撞到

210
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,200
嘿 我查了下Burn失踪的电话

211
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,200
要么是没电要么是关机

212
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,200
好的 查查当地用户数据和财务方面

213
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,000
- 我想找到他当晚在哪儿 做了些什么
- 马上去办

214
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,900
这事肯定不止是关于谁是最好的披萨店

215
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,500
你知道吗 Burns家里肯定有笔记 还有报道的草稿

216
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,300
如果我们能找到 我们就能知道

217
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,600
- 他昨晚是去干嘛的
- 那走吧

218
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,800
门被踢开了

219
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,400
房间里没人

220
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,200
屋子被搜了个底朝天

221
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,000
- 我去问问邻居 看看有没人听到什么
- 好

222
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,000
这些抽屉全被清空了

223
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,300
就算有文件或笔记 现在也没了

224
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,500
不管他现在在写什么报道

225
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,300
有人不想我们发现它

226
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,300
你还好吧?

227
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,800
是 不 是

228
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,500
我想我见过她

229
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,500
我去他的签售会 

230
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,000
那本《萨拉热窝狙击手》

231
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,500
她在...

232
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,300
他签名的时候 她在旁边画画

233
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,500
他一定是个好作家 居然值得你去排队

234
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,800
是啊 他很不错

235
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,000
走吧 我们去拿犯罪现场报告

236
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,200
嘿 我发现些奇怪的事

237
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,797
Burns的邻居说她上周帮他收邮件

238
00:11:43,897 --> 00:11:46,082
很显然Burns告诉他他要出国一段时间

239
00:11:46,182 --> 00:11:48,100
出国? 我们知道他没出过

240
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,000
你知道的 这种谎话是你不想别人找你时候说的

241
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,900
而如果他一直待在别处的话 也许我们还有机会找到他的笔记

242
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,500
我去问问他的编辑 看能不能找到他可能待的地方

243
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,500
一个关于披萨的报道怎么会逼得一个人躲起来?

244
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,100
还导致他们被杀掉? Beckett

245
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,400
嘿 刚拿到犯罪现场报道

246
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,800
披萨店的后门把手上被擦得干干净净

247
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,700
但他们却在披萨烤箱上找到很多"尼克"的指纹

248
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,800
那不出意料啊 我是说 他就在那儿工作

249
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,800
不是真尼克家的尼克

250
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,300
那些指纹是他对街的邻居"好棒真尼克"的

251
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,700
Nick 还是该叫你Sal呢?

252
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,700
- 认识他吗
- 是 我认识他

253
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,900
是写我们披萨店报道的那名记者

254
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,700
那你们俩都谈了些什么?

255
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,600
谁才是真的尼克 我告诉他我的祖父叫尼克

256
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,400
而他是正宗艾里斯岛移民

257
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,400
他一踏进莫特街就开始做他棒极了的披萨

258
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,200
- 还有吗
- 就这些 为什么这么问?

259
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,500
看起来不值得去杀人啊

260
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,800
杀人 我们找到了你的指纹 Sal 布满了整个烤箱

261
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,500
你找到了我的指纹

262
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,500
是的

263
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
所以咱就别绕圈子了 你告诉我们为什么你要杀掉Burns

264
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,800
- 还有 隐瞒不报
- 我可以解释

265
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,300
我去过那儿 但我没杀人

266
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,200
Ralph认为是我往他酱汁里倒的肥皂

267
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,200
所以他闯进我的店里 拿走了我所有电路板的断路器

268
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,000
既然他每天都在吹嘘他的烤箱 所以我就想--

269
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,300
放具尸体进去

270
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,000
不是 是去偷它 几晚前我偷偷进去 
查看下我要偷出来都需要些什么

271
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,200
你开玩笑吧?

272
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,200
昨晚我在斯坦顿岛上的O'MEARY酒吧呢 关门时才走的

273
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,700
好吧 那时天色已晚 我就去了别的地方

274
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,100
- 你想要查嫌疑人的话 就去查Ralph
- 为什么?

275
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,600
你认为呢 你以为他的钱是从那些难吃披萨里赚的啊?

276
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,500
他有背景的 这就是为什么我没干的原因

277
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,600
他只在乎给他的兄弟们洗钱

278
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,000
你没对Burns提过这些吧?

279
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,700
事实上 我提过

280
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,500
洗钱? 哇哦

281
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,400
我们在联邦资料库里查到了你

282
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,200
90年代那会FBI调查过你

283
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,400
你跟Spolano家族有亲密联系

284
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,200
我的联系?

285
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,900
他是我隔代的表亲

286
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,100
我每五年才在感恩节时见他一面

287
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:03,000
- 联邦调查局也没发现什么 
- 他们没发现 也许Burns发现了

288
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,400
那到底是怎么回事 Ralph? 他是不是威胁要曝光你?

289
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,100
你就想让他消失
谁知道你的儿子出现了

290
00:14:11,155 --> 00:14:13,745
你那部让你骄傲的烤箱却还没完成使命

291
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,800
我卖披萨挣钱

292
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,900
你想看我的账本吗? 看嘛

293
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,900
你会发现跟联邦政府调查的结果一模一样

294
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,600
完全 没有 问题!

295
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,100
Sal让你们来查我的对吧?

296
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,100
最初就是Sal把联邦政府扯进来 想害我关门

297
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,500
- 你们应该去查他 
- Sal昨晚有不在场证据

298
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,500
而你呢 Carbone先生?

299
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,600
我在家睡觉呢 问我老婆就知道了

300
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,900
还有那个记者 他问我的都是披萨的事

301
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,500
这家伙肯定犯了什么事

302
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,400
可我们还没任何证据

303
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,200
嘿 Ryan 查到昨晚受害人的情况了吗?

304
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,800
还在等银行那边的消息 但我找到了他的电话记录

305
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,500
昨晚什么都没有 只有前几天跟他的编辑通过几次电话

306
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,300
一个记者在做新闻调查?

307
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,900
- 应该电话很多才对
- 也许他走哪都用公共电话联络

308
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,800
- 照片上的女孩有线索么? 
- 没有

309
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,200
不过我联系到了Burns在波特兰的前妻

310
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,700
- 他们很多年没见了 
- 哟 有发现

311
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,500
我细查了Burns的公寓 起初邻居们都说

312
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,600
"他很安静 不怎么跟人来往"

313
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,300
但有个刚回家的邻居说她看见Burns

314
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,700
在离开公寓前跟一个人有过激烈的争吵

315
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,600
- 关于什么? 
- 她只记得另一个人在吼

316
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,400
"如果你敢发表 我发誓我会杀了你!"

317
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,000
有问到什么长相吗?

318
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,600
我给你个提示 他既"真"...

319
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,500
又"好棒"

320
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
我是跟Burns吵架了? 那又怎样?

321
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,400
吵架又不犯法

322
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,300
自由言论可不包括死亡威胁 Sabalini先生

323
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,000
- 或者谋杀
- 我说了 我昨晚在家

324
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,700
是 没错 但你妻子说的可不一样

325
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,800
貌似她记得你半夜溜出去了

326
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,400
你还以为她睡着了

327
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,800
她告诉我们你是去找"那个弗拉特布什的贱人"了

328
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
而且今早她当面问你

329
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,400
你告诉她你进城去了 因为店里有急事

330
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,200
我们查过了 并不是那样

331
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,900
那么你到底对谁说了谎 Luca 我 还是你妻子?

332
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,900
我妻子

333
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,100
我昨晚跟Angie在一起 你们可以去问她

334
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,000
倒是可以 但我不一定相信她的话

335
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,900
你和Burns都吵些什么?

336
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,500
他要报道我的事 毁掉我所有的努力成果

337
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,600
- 我得阻止他 
- 他要写什么?

338
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,000
关于我的披萨

339
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,000
报道我的脱脂披萨为什么那么好吃

340
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,300
那就是用真正的芝士做的

341
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,100
一点儿也不脱脂

342
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,700
- 你为了这个就要杀人? 
- 我是吓唬他而已

343
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,200
而且Burns昨晚还打电话给我

344
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,400
- 他说如果我肯帮个忙他就考虑不写了
- 帮什么忙?

345
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,900
嘿 他没说是什么

346
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,100
他原本今天要找我说这事儿的

347
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,300
你说他昨晚打给你了? 从哪打来的?

348
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,900
好的 有了 打给他手机的电话

349
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,000
是来自市中心的Beta酒店

350
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,400
好的 我们走

351
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,500
谢谢

352
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,400
现金支付 用Melville这名字登记入住

353
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,600
这家伙的确相当谨慎

354
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,100
Castle 他的电脑在这儿

355
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,500
好的

356
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,200
"纽约的好棒真披萨之战"

357
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,500
言语犀利

358
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,000
细腻的散文体

359
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,300
这不是揭露性报道

360
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,900
- 是一篇吹捧报道 
- 我都能闻到大蒜味儿了

361
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,300
但除了披萨没有什么重要的内容

362
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,500
- 或使他被害的原因 
- 他的近期备忘

363
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,000
披萨 食谱

364
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,900
联...

365
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,000
- 什么? 
- 看看这个

366
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,600
时间是昨晚

367
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,200
他跟某人见面了

368
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,700
这就是某人的电话 就在他被杀之前

369
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,600
- 我查查这电话 
- 你还有电话追踪程序?

370
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,400
对 纽约警局的 我们刚刚启用

371
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,600
- 我能不能... 
- 喔

372
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,100
好吧

373
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,100
那我也不给你玩我的"愤怒小鸟"了

374
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,000
而且是刚刚更新的哟

375
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,000
"Johnny Farrell Swede Anderson"

376
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,800
这俩名字怎么这么耳熟?

377
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,200
不知道 不过这人认得出来吧?

378
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,500
就是Burns钱包里照片上的女人

379
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,200
对了 Monica Wyatt

380
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,600
如果她昨晚跟他见过面

381
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,400
- 她可能就是他生前最后见到的人
- 他们是不是一起去吃披萨了呢

382
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,600
- 作为披萨店有点儿太高档了吧 
- 除非她是中间人

383
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,900
洗钱的中间人?

384
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,400
她把资金转移到瑞士银行帐户

385
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,500
用的是Johnny Farrell和Swede Anderson这俩名字

386
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,600
或者真的如她所言是个房产经纪人

387
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,700
噢 那只是她躲过联邦政府监视的幌子

388
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,000
- 从小到大 你有很多臆想出来的朋友吧? 
- 现在还是多

389
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,100
嗨 有什么要帮忙的吗?

390
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,800
我真不敢相信他还留着这个

391
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,800
我们第一次约会时我送他的

392
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,100
那你们俩在一起多久了?

393
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,300
就几个月

394
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,000
可是 这照片应该是三年前的了

395
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,800
他女儿意外死亡后我们见过一两次

396
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,100
他变了很多 不怎么跟人接触

397
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,600
你昨晚为什么见他?

398
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,700
我 我昨晚没见他啊

399
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,800
可根据他的备忘 他昨晚10点跟你会面的

400
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,800
那不是会面 是约会

401
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,500
- 可是... 他没来 
- 你刚说你几年没见他了

402
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,500
- 怎么突然又约会呢? 
- 我俩有天在街上碰见

403
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,800
感觉很奇怪 因为...

404
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,800
是在附近的镇子里 我从来不去那儿 

405
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,100
他说他也从来不去

406
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:58,000
- 但他是为了写一个报道 
- 他有告诉你关于什么的吗?

407
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,800
没有

408
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,900
他看起来如何 嗯 焦虑 烦恼?

409
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:09,100
他就是他 还跟过去一样

410
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,800
好像在查什么东西

411
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,900
刚从档案馆过来

412
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,900
不知他查到了什么 他看起来非常兴奋

413
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,300
- 档案馆?
- 对

414
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,300
Wyatt小姐 Johnny Farrell或Swede Anderson
这两个名字你有印象吗?

415
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,000
恐怕没有

416
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,700
Monica Wyatt... 查清了

417
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:36,008
她的经纪人公司说她总是抱怨佣金太少

418
00:20:36,058 --> 00:20:37,900
但除了这个 她就清白了

419
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,000
- 还找到什么了吗? 
- 没有 剩下的都关于披萨了

420
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,900
嘿 我刚查到Burns的财政记录

421
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,300
- 昨晚有什么动静吗? 
- 呃 有的 很奇怪

422
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,700
昨晚11点15分 他在自动取款机上取钱了

423
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:56,200
- 在哪? 
- 距离"真尼克"15个街区远的一个破地方

424
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,000
但奇怪的是 他交易都没完成

425
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,100
你是说他取消了交易

426
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,600
不 不 是没完成 他把卡插进去

427
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,000
但好半天都没进行交易

428
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,400
所以卡被吃了 大概是...

429
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,700
- 发生了什么事 
- 去找自动取款机的监视录像 我们就能查明了

430
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,200
我明早到档案馆去一趟

431
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,200
看看Burns到底去查了什么

432
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,500
- 那个... 
- 怎么了?

433
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,000
Alexis还是去参加了Lauren的派对

434
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
出乎我们的意料...

435
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,300
看来派对搅和得不太成功?

436
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,400
如果Lauren不是世上最有心计的贱人

437
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,000
- 就什么都不会发生了
- 喔

438
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,700
- 让她发泄吧
- 乐队开始表演

439
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,800
Lauren就叫Ashley跟她一起上台

440
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,000
在所有人面前吻了他

441
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,700
- 贱人啊
- 她怎么能这样对我 这样对Ashley?

442
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,100
- 那Ashley什么反应? 
- 他丢脸死了 跑下台去 我们就走了

443
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,000
然后他不停对我道歉

444
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,300
说不知道她会那样做

445
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,000
她一直都想把我们拆散

446
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
- 这就是她的大计划
- 可她并没成功啊 亲爱的

447
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,500
你和Ashley倒感情更好了 而且 这让她看起来很傻

448
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,400
对 我也希望如此

449
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,700
但我上网发现 Ashley欺骗了我

450
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,800
她已经把他俩接吻的照片贴在她主页上了

451
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,300
太可怕了

452
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,500
Beckett在哪?

453
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,800
噢 档案馆

454
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,800
- 去查Burns要找的东西
- 好的

455
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:36,400
听着... 如果我给你个网页

456
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:41,000
你能让你的朋友黑进这主页删几张照片吗?

457
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,000
又有人在网上发现你的裸照了?

458
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,800
不 不是我的 是Alexis

459
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,700
是为了Alexis

460
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,000
呃 我更听不懂了 关于什么的?

461
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,800
好吧

462
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,100
一个学校的坏女孩强吻了Alexis的男朋友

463
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,500
还把照片作为证据发在她主页上

464
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,100
- Alexis就... 非常难过 
- 嗯

465
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:08,300
- 我可以让我朋友Tony帮忙搞定 你懂的 私下里
- 谢了

466
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,100
还有 呃 这事就别告诉Beckett了

467
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,800
你知道她会什么反应

468
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,800
好的

469
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,300
想滥用警力解决你的私人问题?

470
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,600
什么?

471
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,000
别逗了... 不 你不... 不是的 那个... 

472
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,300
那么 呃 你找到什么了? 有关于Nicks的情况吗?

473
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,500
呃 没有

474
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,600
Burns去找关于一个叫Harley Romero的毒贩

475
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,100
在2003年被谋杀的资料

476
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,600
也就是Harley Playful 也被称为帅哥Harley

477
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,400
- 从照片看来 帅哥这说法是讽刺吧
-  一个死了8年的家伙

478
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,000
- 跟披萨有什么关系? 
- 嗯 嘿 Ryan

479
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,100
- 什么 
- 你有查这两家尼克店和他们所有雇员的资料吗?

480
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,900
噢 是的 我正在看呢

481
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,100
- 基本没什么大问题
- 有关于毒品的起诉吗?

482
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,000
- 没有 都跟毒品无关 
- Romero? 你是觉得

483
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,547
- 某个黑帮跟"真尼克"扯上了关系? 
- 根据资料看 

484
00:23:58,547 --> 00:24:00,600
- 跟任何黑帮都没有联系 
- 有人很不喜欢他

485
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,900
这上面说他被打了好多枪 然后塞进油桶烧死的

486
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,800
对 传闻是某个毒贩

487
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,200
- 因为地盘之争杀了他
- 那Burns为什么去查他呢?

488
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:14,900
哟 银行把监视录像送来了 你们得过来看看

489
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,400
看起来他在躲避什么

490
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,700
他是在逃 看看这个

491
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,100
他知道自己在被拍摄 他想告诉我们什么

492
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,300
他正写下来呢

493
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,000
- 喔! 
- 好的 倒回去

494
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,500
对 停在这儿

495
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,200
他有一把刀

496
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,500
他想告诉我们什么

497
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,000
- 却记录了自己被杀的过程
- 把脸放大

498
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,700
Castle 看看这张脸

499
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,300
是Harley Romero

500
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,100
而且他活得好好的

501
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,400
他干嘛停下来写东西?

502
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,800
- 而不是一直跑呢? 
- 那街上空无一人 而且是死胡同

503
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,200
- 也许Burns知道自己逃不掉了
- 知道他在写什么吗?

504
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,900
我们在等技术科放大图像

505
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,100
但我们发现这Harley跟几个披萨店都没关系

506
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,700
也许披萨本就跟这事无关

507
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,800
也许是Burns老早就认识Harley了

508
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,100
不 我完全不认识这人

509
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,100
Burns有没有提到以前跟Harley有关的什么事情?

510
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,900
从没有 这家伙被认为死掉的时候

511
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,500
Gordon被分配到第二次海湾战争的海军2师

512
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,700
Shaw先生 Johnny Farrell或Swede Anderson
这两个名字您知道吗?

513
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,400
是啊 我知道

514
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,400
- 这两个都是老黑色电影里的人物
- 对啦

515
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,300
呃 Johnny Farrell是"吉尔达"里的

516
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,600
Glenn Ford主演的 而Burt Lancaster扮演了

517
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,900
- "杀手"中的Swede Anderson 
- 这两个名字有什么重要呢?

518
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,800
这个Harley 他贩的是什么毒品?

519
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,400
海洛因 怎么了?

520
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
因为Burns唯一追查过的海洛因报道至今都没有完成

521
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,400
有一个毒品交易很广的纽约帮派

522
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,100
他们开店做些合法生意

523
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,900
有人需要买毒品时 他们就会用一种暗号

524
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,600
那些暗号恰巧就是黑色电影里的角色

525
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,800
就是那篇报道毁了他

526
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,100
- 为什么? 
- 因为这帮派背后的人

527
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,000
就是Cavallo

528
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,900
Gordon Burns那是在太岁头上动土

529
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,100
Cavallo是谁?

530
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:28,200
一个街头神话 都市传奇人物

531
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,500
每当有毒贩被杀 人们都说是Cavallo干的

532
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,700
- 但他只是个虚构人物
- 噢 Cavallo是真实的

533
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,000
拜托 Shaw 我们都听过那些唬人的传闻

534
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,700
- 我没听过 
- 传闻Cavallo是被那个哥伦比亚大毒枭

535
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,900
"征服者"Khazi一手带出来的

536
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,600
而后来他一枪打死了老大哥

537
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,200
割断了他所有孩子的喉咙 接管了他的生意

538
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
但我是说 那只是个神话故事

539
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,800
对Burns来说不是 对他的女儿也不是

540
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,700
Burns曾告诉我他有了一个机会接近Cavallo

541
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,100
第二天 他跟女儿一起在街上走 一辆车突然冒出来

542
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,600
他正要上前去 腿就被打断了

543
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,400
Nina就在20英尺外 血流不止 他都不能爬过去抱她

544
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,800
所以别跟我说Cavallo是虚构的

545
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,000
听起来Burns就像以色列之王 而Cavallo就是他的白鲸

546
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,400
他的确是用Melville这名字登记酒店

547
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,800
如今看来Burns成名的原因还真有点滑稽

548
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,400
虽说我不喜欢以貌取人

549
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,700
Cavallo这名字 在意大利语里是"马"的意思

550
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,800
或许跟两家尼克还是有关联呢

551
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,400
嘿 Ryan 你在缉毒组的时候

552
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,600
- 第一次听到Cavallo这名字是什么时候? 
- 我不知道 大概在 03年吧

553
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,300
- 就是有好多毒贩被杀的那段时间
- 那就是Harley被杀的时候

554
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:45,100
所以是Harley自导自演假死 
然后杀了他所有的竞争对手

555
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,500
然后到处散播谣言

556
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,200
说有一位新的大毒枭出现...

557
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,200
- 传奇就这样诞生了
- 哟

558
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,500
技术科放大优化了自动取款机录像

559
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,600
正送过来

560
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,600
我还是看不清

561
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,600
再放一遍

562
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,000
你能把画面一帧帧慢放吗?

563
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,100
- 好的
- 你干什么?

564
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,000
拿出我的强项 写

565
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,900
好的 3...

566
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,200
6... S...

567
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,900
- 也可能是5
- 好的 S或者5...

568
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,500
W 1 2... 7?

569
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,400
是个地址

570
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,100
B... A... S? 地下室

571
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:27,400
西127街365号 在地下室里

572
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:27,409
离自动取款机就三个街区

573
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,900
警察! 不许动!

574
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,100
纽约警察!

575
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,200
没人在 看来有人仓促逃离了

576
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,500
用于切割的咖啡研磨器 用于打包的信封

577
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,000
具备了一间井然有序的海洛因生产车间
所需的一切

578
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,100
让C.S.U.来清理现场

579
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,400
有情况马上向我汇报

580
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,500
看来你的以色列之王 找到他的白鲸了

581
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,000
还把他拖下水了

582
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,000
爸爸  嗨 老爹再见

583
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
不亲一个?

584
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,300
- Alexis 你的脸怎么回事?
- 没事

585
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,200
没事才怪 怎么了?

586
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,300
Lauren 她在学校的洗手间截住我

587
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:16,400
说我毁了她的派对 还指责我黑了她的账户

588
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,300
- 删了她的照片 说得像真的一样
- 然后呢?

589
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:24,700
我骂她卑鄙 她就抓我 我就...

590
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,900
- 你就咋样?
- 我就揍了她

591
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,600
哇 你怎么想的啊?

592
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,000
不知道 我不是这样子的

593
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,800
我既不会破坏别人的派对 也不会动手

594
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,600
但是 爸爸 她让我火冒三丈

595
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,600
我晓得 但报复并非解决的办法

596
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,600
你报复她 她报复你 终有一天
你们中的一个会死在披萨炉里

597
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,200
这是你想要的结果吗? 我想说

598
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,959
你这一生 要学会对付

599
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:52,700
很多小气而卑鄙的女人

600
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:57,400
你要放聪明一点 别跟自己过不去

601
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,700
好吗?

602
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,200
好的

603
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,900
过来吧

604
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,100
- 你有痛扁她吗
- 差不多吧

605
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,200
好样的

606
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,200
我应该早点干涉的

607
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,000
为何? Lauren迟早都会想出办法破坏Alexis的生活

608
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,200
Lauren没有高明的罪犯头脑

609
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,800
- 她只是一个青少年而已
- 啊 Castle

610
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,500
千万别低估一个有预谋的女人的能力

611
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,300
我不会的 手头上有大把赡养费支票为证

612
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,500
Beckett 我刚从实验室过来

613
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,500
我们在屋子里找到的海洛因

614
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,100
和下东区所兜售的大部分白粉相符

615
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,100
- 有关于Harley的消息没?
- 长官 如果关于这家伙的谣言有半数是真的

616
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,900
那么到处都布有他的耳目

617
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,700
所以我想 在得知更多情况之前
先暂停发布全境通告

618
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,100
- 随时向我汇报
- 是 长官

619
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,600
Shaw说Cavallo通过不法行业销售产品

620
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,600
你觉得他在利用其中一家披萨店?

621
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,800
嗯 但我们申请不到授权令去摸索情况

622
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,500
我们得找到更加确切的线索

623
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,400
C.S.U.把地下室翻了个底朝天
没找到任何指纹

624
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,900
有目击者见到Burns被追击吗?

625
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,100
街区里没人看到任何东西

626
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:08,800
不过有位警员在提款机旁边的下水道找到这个

627
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:13,720
- Burns的手机?
- 一个经验丰富的战地记者竟然会在

628
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,900
逃命的时候落下手机

629
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,500
- 不觉得很奇怪吗? 
- 你觉得是他故意扔的?

630
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,900
- 所以追杀他的人就没法拿到手机
- 也无从知道上面的信息

631
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:26,400
他打的最后一通电话是911 但是没有拨出

632
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,900
这是在毒品制造所旁 他在监视披萨店

633
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,500
是Monica 她牵涉其中

634
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,000
Monica Wyatt
纽约警察! 开门!

635
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,000
 Monica!

636
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,700
退后

637
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,300
纽约警察!

638
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,800
Monica

639
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,100
他 他要杀我

640
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,200
- 窗户
- 走

641
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,400
- Monica 是谁下的手?
- 我说出来的话就死定了

642
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,200
废话不说 是谁?

643
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,000
Cavallo

644
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,700
之前Gordon的事 我没有撒谎

645
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,200
我们之前是有约会过 我以为他真的喜欢我

646
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,300
但他只是为了接近Cavallo才和我在一起

647
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,200
我从未想过...

648
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,200
市中心的房地产经纪人为什么会和毒贩扯上关系?

649
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,900
他们的实验室是流动的

650
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,738
每个月都要换一次场所

651
00:32:42,838 --> 00:32:45,100
我能拿到他们所需的一切资料

652
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:48,300
我不是这样的人

653
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,600
- 我从未想过...
- 这一切是如何开始的?

654
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,400
几年前

655
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,900
我遇到些麻烦

656
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,300
欠了别人点钱

657
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:03,800
有个人找到我 说他能帮我渡过难关

658
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,400
我只要时不时帮他个忙就好

659
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,200
那时候 一切看起来都是无害的

660
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,200
但是这人知道我的根底

661
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,700
了解一些旁人不可能知道的事情

662
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,100
我想离开

663
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,800
但是在Gordon的孩子出事之后 我...

664
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,400
几天前 Gordon找到我

665
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,200
说他需要我的帮助

666
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,400
他说我能结束这一切 然后我俩都能获得自由

667
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,900
我只要带他过去就好

668
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,600
现在Gordon死了 下一个就是我了

669
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,600
Cavallo是什么人?

670
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,300
- 我从未见过他
- 他不是要杀你吗?

671
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:48,100
如果我知道Cavallo是何人的话
我为什么不告诉Gordon?

672
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,400
我之前只和Cavallo的助手打过交道

673
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,200
- 也就是想杀我的那个人
- 他是谁?

674
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,600
他叫Harley

675
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,000
他吗?

676
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,900
Harley就是Cavallo

677
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,400
这么说Cavallo就藏在大家鼻子底下

678
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,400
我怎么可能找到他? 都是他找我

679
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,400
Monica Gordon说得没错

680
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,300
我们可以结束这一切 但我们需要你的帮助

681
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:23,600
我们认为Cavallo通过一家披萨店贩毒
但我们不知道具体是哪家

682
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,500
对不起 我不知道是哪家

683
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,900
这一带我们都搜过了

684
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,600
被他给跑了

685
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,782
好 你们带Monica去急诊检查一下吧

686
00:34:34,882 --> 00:34:36,700
再送她去缉毒科

687
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,200
- 让他们跟她谈谈
- 最后一个问题

688
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,600
Johnny Farrell和Swede Anderson?

689
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,100
就是因为他们Gordon才被牵扯进来的

690
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:52,200
他在披萨店听到有人提到这个名字
就知道这是Cavallo的暗号

691
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,300
- 这都是上周用的名字了
- 你知道这周的吗?

692
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,500
不知道 但Gordon说都出自他最爱的电影

693
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,900
"马尔他之鹰"

694
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,000
- 你打小报告!
- 啥? 我咋了?

695
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,900
我不管这些人能不能认出你来

696
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,400
你再留着他们 我们手头上可能又多一桩命案

697
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,100
放轻松 就快完了

698
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,700
我们 查过了两家尼克 还有两家

699
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:20,200
- 好 待会儿再打给你
- 我在想我会不会用西德尼・格林斯垂的角色--Kasper Gutman

700
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,400
这是一个爱披萨的人

701
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,500
咱们都已经买定离手了 
所以就走到底吧

702
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,100
来一片?

703
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,200
不 要外带的 给Spade先生

704
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,500
Sam Spade

705
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,600
明白 Spade先生

706
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,900
订单准备好了

707
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,600
Spade先生 给

708
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,800
我们给你记账上

709
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,000
谢谢

710
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,900
这下可好 披萨藏宝

711
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:06,900
藏毒 交易 阴谋销售

712
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:11,600
轻易就能判个30年 Sal 实实在在的30年啊

713
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,800
如果你和Burns的谋杀有关 那就是终生了

714
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,300
- 不 那和我没有任何关系 我发誓
- 你发誓? 那你打算如何解释?

715
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,800
你想说是Harley提的主意
把尸体放到你竞争对手的烤炉里吗?

716
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,200
Sal 你可是做披萨的

717
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,600
往披萨炉里放尸体这一招
对你很有利啊

718
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,700
不不不 都是他 全是他

719
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,000
这么说你是受害者咯?

720
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
我的店处境不好

721
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,300
然后他来了 他说他老板能帮上忙

722
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,900
我只需要把店借给他几个月

723
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,000
他就会帮我...

724
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,300
实现梦想

725
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,800
梦想?

726
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,500
他说结束之后

727
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,600
他老板会...

728
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,100
放火烧了"真尼克"

729
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,300
我原本不是这样的

730
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,100
我连大麻都没抽过

731
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,000
但那些披萨店的出现

732
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,100
- 快把我逼疯了
- Burns的尸体是怎么到炉子里去的?

733
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,400
那晚Harley给我打了电话

734
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,700
说他要往我炉子里扔点东西

735
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,800
他没说是什么东西

736
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,592
嗯 但你知道肯定不是一盘卤汁面条

737
00:37:12,592 --> 00:37:17,700
我说没门 我可不提供火化服务

738
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,700
我没想到我拒绝的东西

739
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,700
到头来会出现在Ralph Carbone的炉子里

740
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,900
Sal 你想我们帮忙吗?

741
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,800
- 想让我们在检察官面前说些好话吗?
- 嗯

742
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,400
那就帮我们找到他 帮我们找到Cavallo

743
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,500
你找不到他的

744
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,600
都是他找上你

745
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,400
- Sal 这可帮不上忙
- 你不明白

746
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,500
货卖完之后 我给他打电话

747
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,700
他就送过来

748
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,700
那就打给他

749
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,300
Harley Romero 又名传奇Cavallo

750
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,300
没有律师在 他是不会开口的

751
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,700
我们有提款机的录像和Sal的证词
他是得请一个律师

752
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,100
你仔细想想 这样做还是很醒目的

753
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,400
一个低调的中间人打理所有的肮脏活计

754
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,700
大家却忙着寻找那个神秘而恐怖的幕后黑手

755
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,600
但是谁都没见过那人 因为他并不存在

756
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,400
不管真实与否 他都能避开很长一段时间 干得好

757
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,600
缉毒科已经审完Monica Wyatt了

758
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,000
- 她会全面合作
- 好 带她出来

759
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,900
在她的住所旁边安置一辆巡逻车
以防Cavallo在外有朋友报复

760
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,000
怎么了?

761
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,600
我在想Burns 他离抓住杀害女儿的凶手

762
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,700
仅一步之遥 却遇到了难关

763
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,700
嗯 现在终于能将其绳之以法了 总算是个安慰

764
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,000
- 你知道有件事始终困扰着我吗?
- 嗯?

765
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,500
他在逃命 为什么要扔掉手机?

766
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,400
嗯 或许他知道自己要遇害了

767
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,300
- 他希望有人知道真相
- 什么真相?

768
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,700
- 那上面连Cavallo的照片也没有
- 确实

769
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:15,400
那上边只有一个人的照片

770
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,200
再问几个问题 Wyatt女士

771
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,200
我都等了一小时了

772
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,800
你知道这单案子最有意思的是什么吗

773
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,700
涉案的人员都用了虚假的身份 你也一样

774
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:42,700
Monica Wyatt 这里说你是02年从洛杉矶搬来纽约的

775
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,400
是的 怎么?

776
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,700
我们稍微调查了一下 找到的唯一一个
Monica Wyatt

777
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:53,100
是一个瘾君子 她遭到近身射击

778
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,100
随后被扔进洛杉矶河

779
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,900
半年后

780
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:00,300
传言有一个残忍的新头目开始扫荡街区

781
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,800
你认为那是我?

782
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,300
我是个房地产经销商 你们不是去过我的公寓了?

783
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,600
嗯 我们见到那个了

784
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,400
但所有其他的只能在网上找到

785
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,100
你什么意思?

786
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,900
你的房子卖给了Walter Neff
Frank Chambers

787
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:20,100
Richard Harland 都是黑色电影里的人物

788
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,300
并不真实存在

789
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,200
你在毒品上赚了数百万

790
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,200
然后转为房地产资产

791
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:32,000
洗清自己 同时制造出Cavallo的神话

792
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,100
Gordon并非死于追逐神话

793
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,100
哦 是的 Gordon

794
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,600
你说的不全是谎话

795
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,500
你确实是几年前遇见他的

796
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,900
但你们不是情侣

797
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:45,400
他是一个你视为眼中钉的记者
拼命想要了解更多

798
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,100
直到从天而降的车祸终结了他女儿的性命

799
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,500
这件事让你清净了几年

800
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,600
但是他在尼克披萨店发现了你的踪迹

801
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,300
你不得不根除掉他

802
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,300
然后你搬出了牺牲品Harley 来帮自己脱罪

803
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,500
Harley袭击了我

804
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,200
是的 而且随后他从太平梯逃走

805
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:11,000
速度实在惊人 导致纽约最棒的两位探员

806
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,900
根本看不到他的影子 更别说抓人了

807
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,400
自己打自己

808
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,200
效果还不错

809
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,400
你知道我刚想到什么吗?

810
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,300
所有被Cavallo引用了名字的黑色电影

811
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,900
都有一个共同点

812
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,000
片中都有一位祸水红颜

813
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,800
我要见律师

814
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,600
很好 你还没睡

815
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,400
想睡的时候偏睡不着

816
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,800
我也一样

817
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,900
- 这是在Stefano买的吗?
- 嗯

818
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,200
你大老远过桥去买披萨?

819
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,000
不是谁都能享用到的

820
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,800
新鲜紫苏和香肠

821
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,500
那啥 有最新进展吗...

822
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,800
我今天和学校的辅导老师开了个调解会

823
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:10,500
原来Lauren是生我气
因为我经常和Ashley在一起

824
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:14,200
- 她觉得我重色轻友
- 那你怎么办?

825
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,100
拥抱解决了

826
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,700
然后你们又是好朋友了?

827
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,400
这还不得而知

828
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,100
这样的伤害

829
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,000
- 要靠时间来疗伤
- 时间...

830
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,200
还有披萨

831
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,300
看啊

832
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,000
干杯
