大侦探波罗探案集

9
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
第11季第3集 第三个女郎

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,150
先生 一位年轻的女士登门拜访
A young lady has called in, sir.

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,870
这个时间我不见客的 乔治 不见
I do not see people at this hour, George. Non.

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,230
是的 先生
No, sir.

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,790
她有没有说为什么想见我?
Does she give a reason for wishing to see me?

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,870
她说奥利弗夫人推荐了您 先生
She says Mrs Oliver recommended you, sir.

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,630
说是她可能杀了人
It's about a murder she might have committed.

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,630
可能杀了人? 你的意思是她自己不知道?
Might have committed? You mean she does not know?

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,830
这个理由并不充分 乔治
This is not very satisfactory, George.

18
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,390
不过另一方面 事情也许会很有趣
But, on the other hand, it might be interesting.

19
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,110
麻烦你 帮我换衣服
Help me to dress, s'il vous plat.

20
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,470
谢谢 等等
Merci. Moment.

21
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,630
好了
Bon.

22
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,510
小姐 这边请
This way, miss.

23
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,550
小姐 你好
Bonjour, mademoiselle.

24
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,110
我听说您与奥利弗夫人相熟
I hear you are acquainted with Madame Oliver.

25
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,110
您想来见我? 您请坐
You wish to see me? Sit down, I pray of you.

26
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,710
您是赫尔克里・波罗?
You're Hercule Poirot?

27
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,350
如假包换
Assuredly.

28
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,900
那个有名的侦探? 
The famous detective?

29
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,670
我算是小有名气吧 是的
Some people have heard my name, oui.

30
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,180
那么 我该如何为您效劳呢 小姐?
Now, how may I help you, mademoiselle?

31
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,470
我的男仆说您可能杀了人
My manservant mentioned a murder that you might have committed.

32
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,730
您认为我很可笑 
You find me amusing.

33
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,080
不 绝无此意 小姐
No, not at all, mademoiselle,

34
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,630
不过如果杀了人 自己知道才正常
but it is normal to know if one has committed a murder.

35
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,670
不过我并不...正常 您看不出来吗?
But I'm not... normal. Can't you see that?

36
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,550
小姐 我眼前所见的
I see only what is before me, mademoiselle.

37
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,670
只有一位焦急不安的年轻女子
A young lady who is anxious.

38
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,390
能跟我说说您想象中的这起谋杀案吗...
So, would you like to tell me about this murder that you imagine you...

39
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,390
我真不该来的 我以为您也许能理解
It was a mistake to come here. I thought you might understand.

40
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,370
我以为您也许能救我一命 
I thought you might be able to save me.

41
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,750
怎么救呢 小姐?
From what, mademoiselle?

42
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,790
没什么 已经无所谓了 到此为止
Nothing. It doesn't matter now. It's done.

43
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,710
还有...你太老了!
Besides... you're too old!

44
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,150
太老了?
Too old?

45
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,470
真是伤人!
How hurtful!

46
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,900
不 不 没关系的 夫人
No, no, no, not at all, madame.

47
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,470
女孩子就是这样
Girls are like that.

48
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,470
她们觉得过了三十五岁的人都只剩半条命
Anyone over 35 they think is half dead.

49
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,790
女孩子都不理智 您必须认识到这一点
They've no sense, girls. You must realise that.

50
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,050
不过您为什么建议她来拜访我? 
But why did you suggest she visit me?

51
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,350
她认为有桩谋杀案
She thought there'd been a murder.

52
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,790
事情在哪儿发生?
Where was this?

53
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,140
- 谋杀案? - 不 是你们的对话
- The murder? - No, the conversation.

54
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,070
在这儿 就在电梯里
It was here, in the lift.

55
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,070
她完全心慌意乱了 想找愿意倾听的人
She was completely distraught, in need of a sympathetic ear.

56
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,650
那么 您在这部电梯里遇到了这个陌生的女孩
So, you meet in this lift this girl who is a stranger

57
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,550
而她也随即跟您坦白她杀了人?
 and immediately she confesses to a murder?

58
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,590
是的 听起来很像我小说里的桥段是吗?
Yes, it does sound like the plot of one of my novels, doesn't it?

59
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,260
不过 波罗先生 我昨晚在一场舞会上见过她
But you see, Monsieur Poirot, I'd met her before. Last night, at a party.

60
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,910
就在楼上她们的公寓里
Upstairs in their flat.

61
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,710
- 她是第三个女孩 - 第三个女孩?
- She was the third girl. - The third girl?

62
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,430
您也知道如今这世道
Well, you know how it is these days.

63
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,950
一个女孩租下一整套公寓 她的朋友再合租
One girl takes a lease on a flat, her friend joins her,

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,950
其中第二好的房间 租金会少点 
in the second-best bedroom, paying less rent,

65
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,120
然后再找人租剩下的房间
then they find somebody for the room that's left.

66
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,790
第三个女孩 就是她了
The third girl. That was her.

67
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,190
啊 第三个女孩 再多说一点舞会的事吧
Ah, the third girl. Tell to me more about this party.

68
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,990
她们闹得吵吵嚷嚷
They were making such a terrible racket.

69
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,710
我根本无法写作 于是我决定和她们一道
Totally impossible to work. So, I decided to join them.

70
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,030
那场舞会是为了庆祝第一个女孩的生日
It was a party to celebrate the first girl's birthday.

71
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,190
她是某个商人的秘书
She's secretary to some businessman or other.

72
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,990
叫克劳迪娅・瑞斯・霍兰德
Claudia Reece-Holland.

73
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,340
非常漂亮 很能干
Very pretty, very efficient.

74
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,910
她就是那种能委以重任的姑娘
Just the sort of girl you need for a tricky job.

75
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,710
第二个女孩大约是叫弗朗西丝吧
The second girl was Frances something or other.

76
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,510
崇尚艺术 是个女演员
Very arty. Works as an actress.

77
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,830
她看上去十分友善...只是有点矫揉造作
She seemed nice enough... if a little artificial.

78
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,000
然后就是第三个女孩 她似乎受了冷落
And then there was the third girl, looking somewhat left out,

79
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,230
好像与其他人相处得不太融洽
as if she didn't quite fit in.

80
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,100
事实上 唯一一次她活跃起来
In fact, the only time she came to life

81
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,060
正是那个"孔雀"出现的时候
was when the peacock arrived.

82
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,500
夫人 您说的"孔雀"是什么?
Madame, what is this peacock?

83
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,790
是了 "孔雀" 至少他给我的感觉是如此
Yes, the peacock. Well, at least that's what he reminded me of.

84
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,870
他是个画家 大卫・贝克
He's a painter. David Baker.

85
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,550
特别浮夸 很...脂粉气
Very flamboyant, quite... effete,

86
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,540
尽管如此 他一到场就不停地
though he was making eyes at the third girl

87
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,030
朝第三个女孩暗送秋波
from the moment he arrived.

88
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,590
第三个女孩 她的名字是?
This third girl, how does she call herself?

89
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,830
诺尔玛・雷斯塔里克
Norma Restarick.

90
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,530
今天早晨您遇到了诺尔玛・雷斯塔里克小姐
This morning you meet Mademoiselle Norma Restarick,

91
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,070
她向您坦白了杀人一事
and she confesses to a murder.

92
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,520
告诉我 夫人 是谁被杀害了? 
Tell me, madame, who has been murdered?

93
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,230
她没说
Well, she didn't say.

94
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,390
她显得疑惑而又不安
She seemed confused and upset.

95
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,350
所以我建议她来白港大厦来见您
So I suggested she pop over to Whitehaven Mansions and see you.

96
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,790
亲爱的夫人
Chère madame,

97
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,360
您碰巧知晓最近在这栋大楼里
do you know of any murder

98
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,410
发生过任何谋杀案吗?
that has taken place recently? In this building, peut-être?

99
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,420
我倒希望有留意到谋杀案呢
I rather think I'd have noticed a murder,

100
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,150
波罗先生 对吗?
 Monsieur Poirot, don't you?

101
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,830
啊! 纳尔森警长来了
Ah! Inspector Nelson arrives.

102
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,950
也许我们有谋杀案了 夫人
Perhaps we have our murder, madame.

103
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,830
警管 能请你告诉纳尔森警长
Constable, will you tell the Inspector Nelson

104
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,710
赫尔克里・波罗也在这儿吗?
that Hercule Poirot is here?

105
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,750
- 好的 先生 - 有劳
- Yes, sir. - Merci.

106
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,700
波罗 我就猜到你可能会来
Poirot. I might have guessed you'd turn up.

107
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,710
纳尔森警长
Inspector Nelson.

108
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,390
很显然 是自杀
Took her own life, clearly.

109
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,270
嗯 看上去的确如此
Well, that is certainly the impression.

110
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,940
这位不幸的女士是谁? 
Who was the unfortunate lady?

111
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,310
拉维尼娅・施格兰姆
Lavinia Seagram.

112
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,880
据发现她的门房说 
According to the concierge who found her,

113
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,900
她已经在这里住了不少年头
she lived here for many years.

114
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,310
深居简出 鲜有访客...
Kept herself to herself, very few visitors...

115
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,310
...酒量很大
...drank a lot.

116
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,350
一位很不幸福的女子
A very unhappy woman.

117
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,550
现在请告诉我 你来此有何贵干?
Now tell me, what are you doing here?

118
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,630
呃...碰巧来探访一位友人
Er... Merely rendering a visit to a friend.

119
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,270
悲惨的人生 是吗?
A life so sad, huh?

120
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,310
就像她的死亡
As was her death.

121
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,550
- 她有没有留下遗书? - 看来没有
- Did she leave a note of suicide? - It appears not.

122
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,990
您允许我亲自查看一下她的公寓吗?
And will you permit that I examine for myself her apartment?

123
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,350
- 理由? - 仅仅出于好奇
- For what reason? - Curiosity only.

124
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,580
好奇 啊?
Curiosity, eh?

125
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,350
若您执意如此的话
Well, if you must.

126
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,350
多谢 噢 还有一件事 警长
Merci. Oh, one another thing, Inspector.

127
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,630
那位门房还知道施格兰姆小姐的其他事吗?
Did the concierge know anything more about Mademoiselle Seagram?

128
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,750
比如 她的故乡?
For instance, from where did she originate?

129
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,150
还有她搬到这里之前生活得怎么样?
Or how did she live before she came here?

130
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,030
- 只听说她曾经做过保姆 - 啊 谢谢
- Only that she used to work as a nanny. - Ah, merci.

131

Nanny Seagram, Mary and Mademoiselle Norma.

135
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,470
这就是关联
There is the connection.

136
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,510
那玛丽是?
And Mary?

137
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,550
嗯 也许是她母亲
Well, the mother, perhaps.

138
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,310
最后一个快乐的夏天
The last happy summer.

139
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,510
恐怕有些事情不对劲
I fear that there is here something strange.

140
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,550
诺尔玛
Norma.

141
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,590
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

142
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,630
诺尔玛!
Norma!

143
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,630
诺尔玛... 想让我陪你坐坐吗?
Norma... would you like me to come and sit with you?

144
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,670
不用了 我想自己一个人
No, I'd like to be alone.

145
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,030
可不幸地是 我们和你摆脱不了关系了
But unfortunately, we are stuck with you.

146
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,780
她现在这种状况 总是嘟哝着血啊什么的
She's in such a state. She keeps muttering something about blood.

147
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,390
老天爷
Good Lord.

148
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,510
可怜的保姆
Poor Nanny.

149
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,830
你好 安德鲁 请到会客室来
Hello, Andrew. Come through to the drawing room.

150
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,100
谢谢 克劳迪娅
Thank you, Claudia.

151
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,740
弗朗西丝 这位是诺尔玛的父亲
Frances, this is Norma's father,

152
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,870
安德鲁・雷斯塔里克
 Andrew Restarick.

153
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,710
你好吗 弗朗西丝?
How do you do, Frances?

154
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,190
克劳迪娅说你一直对我女儿很好 我很感激
Claudia says you've been very kind to my daughter. I'm grateful.

155
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,970
呃... 你说她在自己的房间里? 
Er... She's in her room, you say?

156
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,750
有什么事让她深感困扰
There's something troubling her very deeply.

157
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,470
她总是念叨着什么死人还有血
She keeps talking about dead people and blood.

158
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,990
你们的一位邻居 保姆施格兰姆...
One of your neighbours, Nanny Seagram...

159
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,590
...自杀了
...has killed herself.

160
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,780
什么?
What?

161
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,520
我刚从她的公寓过来 
I've just come from her apartment.

162
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,540
也许诺尔玛已经察觉了此事
 Perhaps Norma's already found out.

163
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,590
自杀了? 她的老保姆?
Killed herself? Her old nanny?

164
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,910
也难怪她会有这番举动了
Well, no wonder she's behaving as she is.

165
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,950
可怜的诺尔玛
Poor Norma.

166
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,990
是啊 可怜的诺尔玛
Yes, poor Norma.

167
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,140
警察很肯定是自杀? 
The police are quite certain it was suicide?

168
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,350
没错 他们的确是这么想的
Yes, they seem to think so.

169
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,030
保姆施格兰姆是个不幸福的女人
Nanny Seagram was not a happy woman.

170
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,910
- 我还是去和她谈谈 - 嗯
- I'd better talk to her. - Mm.

171
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,270
我当时在那儿
I was there.

172
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,750
我杀了她
I killed her.

173
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,990
你没对其他人说过这事吧 是吗?
You haven't said this to anyone else, have you?

174
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,810
我对...奥利弗夫人说了
I said something... to Mrs Oliver, I think,

175
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:08,590
还有我见过面的一位老人
and to an old man I met.

176
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,550
- 但是没人相信我 - 因为那不是真的
- But no-one believes me. - Because it's not true.

177
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,340
听着... 我想我能帮你
Look... I think I can help you.

178
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,870
有很多地方能帮你摆脱...这些病态的想法
There are places where you can get help... for these morbid thoughts.

179
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,910
你是指精神病院?
An asylum, you mean?

180
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,470
你到底为了什么会杀害保姆?
Why on earth would you kill Nanny?

181
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,510
为什么?
Why?

182
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,790
你说当时在那儿是什么意思?
What do you mean you were there?

183
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,990
她的手腕已被割开
Her wrists were cut open.

184
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,030
我手里握着一把刀
I had a knife in my hand.

185
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,230
你做了些什么?
So what are you going to do?

186
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,270
我想要帮你
I want to help you.

187
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,680
噢 别管我了 
Oh, please let me.

188
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,350
我对于自己犯下的所有过错万分抱歉
I'm so sorry for all the mistakes I've made.

189
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,390
我不需要你的帮助!
I don't need your help!

190
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,030
- 我不要任何人的帮助! - 诺尔玛
- I don't need anybody's help! - Norma.

191
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,570
大卫! 你在这儿干什么? 
David! What are you doing here?

192
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,710
我来看你
I came to see you.

193
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,270
我觉得你也许想出去散散步
I thought you might like to go for a walk.

194
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,310
你有什么麻烦吗?
What's troubling you?

195
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,160
我觉得我快疯了
I think I'm losing my mind.

196
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,710
你对我可以畅所欲言 诺尔玛
You can tell me anything, Norma.

197
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,680
您好 我能为您效劳吗? 
Yes? Can I help you?

198
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,470
是的 我是阿里阿德涅・奥利弗
Yes, I'm Ariadne Oliver.

199
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,430
那个...小说家?
The... The novelist?

200
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,480
抱歉 我们不买上门推销的东西 
Sorry, we don't buy anything at the door.

201
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,590
前两天晚上我也来了克劳迪娅的舞会
I was at Claudia's party the other night.

202
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,020
您就是那个抱怨太吵的女士
You're the woman who complains about the noise.

203
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,830
只在你们跳舞的时候 我刚好住在你们楼下
Only when you're dancing. I live directly below, you see.

204
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,990
我想那也是为什么克劳迪娅邀请我的原因
I think that's why Claudia invited me.

205
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,660
我一直期待和诺尔玛说几句
I was hoping to have a word with Norma.

206
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,150
诺尔玛・雷斯塔里克?
 Norma Restarick?

207
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,990
总之 我和诺尔玛对现代小说谈得非常投契
So, you see, Norma and I were having a marvellous conversation about modern fiction

208
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,630
她还说她很喜欢我的一部作品
and she so sweetly said she'd like to read one of my poor efforts.

209
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,980
所以我答应送给她一本
So I promised to pop one round.

210
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,600
嗯... 然后您就来了 
Mm... And here you are, popping it round.

211
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,990
嗯
Mm.

212
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,150
那么 你是第一个女孩 
So, you're the first girl

213
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,430
你是第二个 你们是老朋友吗?
 and you're the second. Are you old friends?

214
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,150
不是 我只是回应了克劳迪娅房屋合租的广告
No. I answered Claudia's advertisement in Rooms To Let.

215
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,750
诺尔玛也是?
And Norma?

216
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,690
为什么您对诺尔玛
Why are you so interested

217
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,150
如此感兴趣呢 奥利弗夫人?
 in Norma, Mrs Oliver?

218
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,390
她好像被什么困扰着
She seemed troubled about something.

219
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,390
你很熟悉她?
Do you know her well?

220
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,880
诺尔玛的父亲是我的老板
Norma's father is my boss.

221
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,190
安德鲁・雷斯塔里克
 Andrew Restarick.

222
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,350
啊 因此诺尔玛也就碰巧在这儿租下了一间房
Ah, so that's how Norma happened to take a room here.

223
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,030
我猜 他希望你能关照她
He wanted you to keep a kind eye on her, I suppose.

224
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,390
我想是吧
I suppose.

225
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,710
总之 我保证她会拿到书
Anyway, I'll make sure the book gets to her.

226
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,240
你也不知道她在哪儿? 
So, you have no idea where she is?

227
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,950
诺尔玛常常上街
Norma walks the streets a lot.

228
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,830
她是个非常喜欢... 自我反省的姑娘
She's a very... introspective girl.

229
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,790
她有个她很喜欢的舅父 也许她去拜访他了
She has a great-uncle she's fond of. Perhaps she's gone to visit him.

230
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,950
不是的 诺尔玛已经不去十字树篱庄园了
No. Apparently, Norma doesn't go to Crosshedges any more.

231
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,630
她亲爱的舅父有了一位新的红粉知己
Her dear old doddery great-uncle has a new friend,

232
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,750
也就是说诺尔玛不再是他关心的对象了
which means that Norma is no longer the centre of attention.

233
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,990
- 就这些了? - 还有茶吗?
- Was that everything? - Is there any more tea?

234
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,630
"最后一个快乐的夏天"
"The last happy summer. "

235
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,750
- 噢! - 抱歉
- Oh! - Excusez-moi.

236
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,070
啊! 赫尔克里・波罗!
Ah! Hercule Poirot!

237
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,310
著名的侦探
The famous detective.

238
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,950
她说得对 您的确太老了
She was right. You are too old.

239
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,270
您是?
And you are?

240
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,180
- 贝克 大卫・贝克 - 啊
- Baker. David Baker. - Ah.

241
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,100
贝克先生 您和雷斯塔里克小姐很熟 是吗?
Monsieur Baker. You are an acquaintance of Mademoiselle Restarick, are you not?

242
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,150
可以这么说
You could say that.

243
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,030
我猜 您为她父亲工作?
You're working for her father, I suppose?

244
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,380
- 你不喜欢他? - 我从未见过他
- You do not like him? - I've never met him.

245
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,870
- 您有客人 先生 - 谢谢
- Your visitor, sir. - Merci.

246
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,440
你好 您就是那个比利时人?
Hello. Are you the chap from Belgium?

247
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,470
赫尔克里・波罗
Hercule Poirot.

248
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,510
是吗?
Are you?

249
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,420
罗德里克先生 时隔多年还能见到您
Sir Roderick, what a great pleasure it is

250
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,670
真是莫大的荣幸
 to see you after all these years.

251
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,350
噢 是啊 的确
Oh, yes, indeed. Yes, indeed.

252
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,140
多久... 你说有多久了? 
How long... How long would you say?

253
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,710
你信上写的不具体
Your letter wasn't specific.

254
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,900
啊
Ah.

255
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,110
我恐怕您已经不记得我了
I feared that you might have forgotten me.

256
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,360
不过用不着担心 
But not to worry,

257
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,780
我只是碰巧来了十字树篱附近...
 I merely happened to be in the vicinity of Crosshedges...

258
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,670
忘了你? 没有的事 亲爱的朋友 没有的事
Forgotten you? Not at all, dear chap, not at all.

259
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,150
- 坐吧 - 多谢
- Sit down. - Merci.

260
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,650
你说我们是在法国碰到的? 
We met in France, you say?

261
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:11,430
对 在诺曼底
Oui, in Normandy.

262
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,070
就在大战期间 我们都决定了些什么呢?
During the Great War. What decisions we had to make, huh?

263
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,270
您本人 瑞斯上校... 阿伯克隆比将军
You yourself, Colonel Race... General Abercrombie.

264
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,030
还有你... 你就是那个法国小个子!
And you... you were the little Frenchie!

265
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,610
我是那个比利时小个子 
I was the little Belgian.

266
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,030
噢 是的 当然了
Oh, yes, of course. Of course.

267
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,350
你还好吗 呃 波罗?
Those were the days, eh, Purot?

268
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,750
你见过老阿伯克隆比吗?
Do you ever see old Abercrombie?

269
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,390
时不时还见面 是的
Here and there, oui. From time to time.

270
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,490
告诉我 罗德里克先生
Tell me, Sir Roderick,

271
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,750
我注意到门厅的楼梯上
 I could not help but notice in the hallway by the stairs,

272
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,390
- 有一副精美的画像 - 噢 没错 很多
- a portrait so fine. - Oh, yes, lots of those.

273
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,590
有一副画像中的女子非常美丽
This was a portrait of a woman so beautiful.

274
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:51,990
我觉得这幅画像的旁边应该还有一副
And it seemed to me that there must have been at one time a companion piece by its side.

275
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,340
曾经是有的 但不会再有了
Once upon a time. Not any more.

276
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,470
玛丽无法忍受看到它
Mary couldn't stand the sight of it.

277
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,430
玛丽是我最疼爱的侄女
Mary was my favourite niece.

278
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,110
她丈夫安德鲁...抛弃了她
Her husband Andrew... ran out on her.

279
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,470
已经二十年了
It must be 20 years now.

280
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,350
玛丽... 深受打击
Mary... took it badly.

281
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,070
毁了所有能让她想起他的东西
Destroyed everything of hers that reminded her of him.

282
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,830
包括那副该死的画像
Including that damn portrait.

283
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,710
如今他回来了 满心后悔
He's back now and full of regrets.

284
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,710
得知真相的时候悔之已晚
Hell is the truth learned too late.

285
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,460
请您告诉我 罗德里克先生
But tell me, Sir Roderick,

286
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,300
她丈夫 他还住在这儿吗?
 the husband, does he live here still?

287
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,950
安德鲁? 不 没有 他住在伦敦
Andrew? No, no, he lives in London.

288
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,430
不过几天前他来看过我 待了整晚
Although he came to see me a couple of nights ago. Stayed all evening.

289
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,350
我秘书去了伦敦 他就来给我做伴
Keeping me company, he said, while my secretary was in London.

290
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,390
怎么都甩不掉这个该死的家伙
Couldn't get rid of the damn chap.

291
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,030
- 他们有孩子吗? - 有一个
- Did they have children? - One.

292
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,350
诺尔玛
Norma.

293
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,550
母亲呢?
And the mother?

294
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,750
玛丽・雷斯塔里克已去世多年
Mary Restarick has been dead for many years.

295
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,790
噢 索尼娅!
Oh, Sonia!

296
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,190
这位是我的秘书 索尼娅 也是我的眼睛
This is my secretary, Sonia. My eyes.

297
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,070
还有伴侣
And my companion.

298
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,030
久仰了 小姐 我是赫尔克里・波罗
Enchantè, mademoiselle. Hercule Poirot.

299
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,030
- 是的 我猜到了 我读过您的信 - 啊
- Yes, I guessed as much. I read your letter. - Ah.

300
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,640
罗德里克先生很容易疲倦
I'm afraid Sir Roderick tires easily.

301
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,630
他平时不接待客人
He doesn't normally see visitors.

302
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,270
抱歉
Je suis dèsolè.

303
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,390
那我就不耽误他的时间了 
I will detain no longer of his time, huh?

304
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,430
我送您出去
I'll show you out.

305
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,750
- 不 不必烦劳 - 我坚持
- No, no, no, there is no need. - I insist.

306
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,990
雷斯塔里克夫人是个大美人吧 不是吗?
Madame Restarick was a woman most striking, no?

307
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,790
有画为证
Evidently.

308
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,550
请问她是怎么死的?
May I ask how did she die?

309
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,330
我听说她死得...很突然 
I'm told she died... suddenly.

310
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:37,430
太悲惨了
 How sad.

311
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,390
不过她女儿有来探望她的舅父 不是吗?
But her daughter comes to visit her grand-uncle, no?

312
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,310
诺尔玛再也不来了
Norma doesn't come here any more.

313
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,630
- 那是何故? - 我不清楚
- But for what reason? - I have no idea.

314
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,590
来这儿的人通常都是无事不登三宝殿
Nobody ever comes here unless they have good cause.

315
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,430
- 谢谢 - 先生
- Merci. - Sir.

316
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,190
怎么? 你在十字树篱有何发现?
Well? What did you find out at Crosshedges?

317
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,230
一无所获
Nothing.

318
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,270
真是无趣极了
How dreadfully dull.

319
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,790
根本不是
Not at all.

320
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,000
事实上波罗的一无所获
The fact that Poirot discovered nothing

321
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,030
意味着有很多事是被刻意隐瞒的
 means that there is a great deal that is being concealed.

322
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,830
- 你有何发现? - 嗯...
- What did you find out? - Well...

323
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,210
... 第一个女孩告诉我
...the first girl told me

324
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,820
诺尔玛和她舅父闹翻了
 Norma's had a falling-out with her great-uncle.

325
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,550
- 似乎是他有了新欢 - 啊 我明白了
- Something about a new friend he has. - Ah, that I can understand.

326
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,300
那么第二个女孩呢?
And the second girl?

327
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,630
她谈起诺尔玛的时候很热情
She spoke more warmly about Norma.

328
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,030
弗朗西丝・凯瑞 放荡不羁的那个 
Frances Cary, the bohemian one.

329
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:46,550
是的
Oui.

330
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,590
连茶都不会泡
No idea how to make a cup of tea.

331
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,550
那姑娘是在哪儿长大的?
Where was the girl brought up?

332
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,510
当天您整晚都和雷斯塔里克小姐在一起?
And you were with Mademoiselle Restarick all of the evening?

333
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,550
- 在舞会上? - 是的
- At the party? - Oui.

334
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,300
呃... 吃冰淇淋的时候她回房了
Er... She went to her room when the ice cream came out.

335
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,630
哇噢! 谁想吃冰淇淋?
Hoorah! Who would like ice cream?

336
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,020
冰淇淋! 真是个好主意! 
Ice cream! What a wonderful idea!

337
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,950
抱歉失陪
Excuse me.

338
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,230
我还留下了一份 再也找不到能说两句的人
I had a bowl then left. Didn't find anyone to talk to.

339
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,660
没人关心那部小说的命运
Nobody was interested in the fate of the novel.

340
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,900
连你说的那个艺术家也不感兴趣? 
Not even the artist that you mentioned?

341
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,990
那个大卫・贝克?
This David Baker?

342
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,620
他怎么有空理会我 
He was far too busy for me.

343
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,740
他整晚都在和弗朗西丝说话
He spent all evening talking to Frances.

344
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,630
我感觉他们不想让任何人听到他们的谈话
It struck me they didn't want to be overheard by anybody.

345
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,390
噢 还有一件事 克劳迪娅・瑞斯・霍兰德
Oh, one more thing. Claudia Reece-Holland,

346
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,660
她是诺尔玛父亲 
she's secretary to Andrew Restarick,

347
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,510
安德鲁・雷斯塔里克的秘书
 Norma's father.

348
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,660
看来我想见这位雷斯塔里克先生
Well, it seems I must make an appointment

349
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,310
必须要预约了 是不是?
to see this Monsieur Restarick, no?

350
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,510
- 能为您效劳吗? - 没什么了 夫人
- What can I do? - Nothing, madame.

351
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,550
- 没有? - 没有 真的没有
- Nothing? - No, nothing at all.

352
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,590
只是要当心 好吗?
Just be careful, huh?

353
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,100
只要有谋杀 什么事都有可能发生
Where there is murder, anything can happen.

354
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,920
谋杀? 谁被谋杀了? 
Murder? Who's been murdered?

355
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,830
嗯 当然是施格兰姆保姆了
Well, Nanny Seagram, of course.

356
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,150
您认为她不是自杀的?
So you don't think she took her own life?

357
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,590
不不不
No, no, no.

358
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,940
我从没这么想过
Not for one second.

359
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,470
噢!
Oh!

360
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,550
我决定买点新鞋子
I decided to buy some new shoes.

361
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,590
- 你赞成吗? - 我喜欢腿
- Do you approve? - I like the leg.

362
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,990
- 这么说 他是你的老战友? - 谁?
- So he was an old war comrade of yours? - Who?

363
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,910
那个法国佬? 我从未见过他
The Frog? Never met him in my damn life.

364
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,630
你确定吗?
Are you sure about that?

365
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,400
他说他是不是和阿伯克隆比见面 
He told me he sees old Abercrombie from time to time.

366
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,030
肯定是先做过调查的
Have to dig him up first.

367
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,390
我想他是来问有关诺尔玛和她妈妈的问题的
I think he came to ask questions about Norma and her mother.

368
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,710
嗯...一天里出现了两个爱管闲事的人
Hm... Two nosy parkers in one day.

369
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,910
你是说还有其他人来过?
You mean someone else has been here?

370
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,150
有个叫贝克还是什么的人也来打听过
Well, some arty type called Baker came snooping around,

371
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,190
问了些诺尔玛的问题
asking questions about Norma.

372
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,030
他在找...嗯...照片
And he was looking for er... for photographs.

373
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,840
好像是安德鲁委托他
Seems that Andrew's commissioned a portrait from him

374
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,390
画了一张肖像放在玛丽的旁边
 to hang next to Mary's.

375
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,390
噢 也许这能让那个鬼魂消停一下
Oh, well. Perhaps it'll put that ghost to rest.

376
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,270
我喜欢全家福
I love family photographs.

377
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,470
额 对我再也没好处了
Well, no good to me any more.

378
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,390
我让他想要什么就自己拿
I let him take what he wanted.

379
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,430
他看起来是个无害的小伙子
He seemed a harmless enough chap.

380
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,470
噢 罗迪 你真是天真
Oh, Roddy, you're such an innocent.

381
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,350
你没想过他是觊觎诺尔玛的钱吗?
Doesn't it occur to you that he might be after Norma's money?

382
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,030
你知道的...自从我妻子死后
You know, er... since my wife died,

383
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,430
你的小说陪我度过了
I've spent many a lonely night

384
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,390
无数孤寂的夜晚 奥利弗太太
in your company, Mrs Oliver.

385
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,740
噢 上一本小说简直是天才之作
Ooh, that last one was a work of genius!

386
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,750
女士 不要往回看
Lady, Don't Fall Backwards.

387
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,710
噢 那很有趣 我发誓
Oh, that's funny. I could have swore

388
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,950
警察走的时候我把门锁了
I locked that when the police were done.

389
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,700
非常感谢 阿尔夫 你真好 
Thank you so much, Alf, you're a dear.

390
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,150
我保证 我不会待很久的
I won't be long, I promise.

391
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,270
额 波罗也许愿意坐着什么也不做
He, Poirot, may be content to sit and do nothing,

392
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,390
而我 奥利弗 可不愿意
I, Oliver, am not.

393
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,430
谋杀
Murder.

394
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,470
鬼扯!
Fiddlesticks!

395
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,500
如果我小说里的女人...
If a woman... in one of my novels...

396
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,510
想要藏便条的话...
...wanted to hide a note...

397
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,550
会藏在哪里呢...
...where it would be found...

398
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,230
想藏遗书的话...
...wanted to hide a suicide note...

399
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,070
别人一定会找的地方...
...where someone was bound to look...

400
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,030
别人一定会找的地方...
Where someone was bound to look.

401
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,660
别人一定会找的地方...
Where someone was bound to...

402
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,670
一个女人认为...
Where would a woman consider...

403
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,150
一个很明显...
...an obvious place...

404
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,510
要找的地方?
...to look?

405
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,310
"如果我死了 把这个交给警察"
"To be given to the police in the event of my death. "

406
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,110
是她 是第三个女孩
It's her. It's the third girl.

407
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,270
- 噢! - 我能帮你吗?
- Oh! - Can I help you?

408
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,780
请等一下 
Un moment, s'il vous plait.

409
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,870
我在想...有没有可能
I wonder... if it might be possible

410
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,220
让我见见安德鲁・雷斯塔里克
for me to see a Monsieur Andrew Restarick.

411
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,030
赫尔克里・波罗
Hercule Poirot.

412
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,630
- 请坐 - 谢谢
- Take a seat. - Merci.

413
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,940
查票 请把票都拿出来
Ticket inspection. All tickets, please.

414
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,460
查票 请把票都拿出来
Ticket inspection. All tickets, please.

415
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,630
- 我要下车 - 我要检查你的票
- I need to get off. - I need to see your ticket.

416
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,750
- 我在跟踪一个人 - 你说什么 女士?
- I'm tailing someone. - Pardon, madam?

417
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,660
我说我在跟踪一个人! 
I said I'm tailing someone!

418
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,390
没有票不行 不准下车
Not without a ticket, you're not.

419
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,140
是的 亲爱的 
Yes, dear.

420
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,910
请给我一个甜面包和一杯咖啡
Bath bun and a cup of coffee, please.

421
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,390
什么?
Sorry?

422
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,270
请给我一个甜面包和一杯咖啡
Bath bun and a... cup of coffee, please.

423
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,430
赫尔克里・波罗先生
Monsieur Hercule Poirot.

424
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,590
雷斯塔里克先生
Monsieur Restarick.

425
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,140
你就是那个假装在战中认识罗迪叔叔
You're the chap who called on Uncle Roddy

426
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,390
而去拜访过他的人
 pretending to know him from the war.

427
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,820
我想知道他是不是很客气
I wondered if he was just being polite.

428
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,950
当然 我知道 他不在意访客
And I am aware, of course, that he does not care for visitors.

429
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,460
当然 你不是这样
But not in your case, of course.

430
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,190
我很忙 波罗 说明你的来意
I'm a busy man, Poirot. State your business.

431
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,590
我是来和你谈谈你女儿拜访我的事
I am come to talk with you about the visit rendered to me by your daughter.

432
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,270
- 你见过诺尔玛? - 是的
- You've met Norma? - Yes, indeed.

433
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,590
她让我救她
She asked me to save her.

434
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,350
- 救她? 为什么? - 我也不知道
- Save her? From what? - Well, that I do not know.

435
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,310
你知道吗?
Do you?

436
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,510
- 你好 - 你好 
- Hello. - Hello.

437
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,580
恐怕我不能久留
I'm afraid I can't stay very long.

438
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,470
画室待会有人要来 画肖像
I've somebody coming to the studio. Portrait.

439
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,390
但我以为你说你有东西要给我看
Oh, but I thought you said you had something you were going to show me.

440
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,260
诺尔玛...我希望你停止担心
Norma... I want you to stop worrying

441
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,150
施格兰姆保姆的事
 about what happened to Nanny Seagram.

442
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,750
你怎么会认为你会杀人呢?
What on earth makes you think you could kill somebody?

443
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,870
现在 我知道你是个很富有的年轻女人
Now, I know that you're a rather wealthy young woman,

444
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,710
- 也就是说你一定要小心 - 小心?
- which means you must be careful. - Careful?

445
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,060
- 先生? - 我要走了
- Sir? - I should go.

446
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,270
但我会再和你联系的 诺尔玛
But you'll hear from me again soon, Norma.

447
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,030
别相信任何人
Trust nobody.

448
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,070
连我也别相信
Not even me.

449
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,630
服务员! 服务员! 买单 快点
Waitress! Waitress! My bill, quickly.

450
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,080
我的女儿诺尔玛自从她妈妈死后 
My daughter Norma has often needed psychiatric help

451
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,590
经常需要精神帮助
 since her mother died.

452
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,710
她可能会...歇斯底里
She can get... hysterical,

453
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,710
感伤的...
melodramatic...

454
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,630
事实上 这都是我的错
The fact is, it's all my fault.

455
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:47,160
诺尔玛的妈妈...玛丽...
Norma's mother... Mary...

456
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,910
也觉得生活艰难
also found life difficult.

457
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,550
我懂了 真伤心
I see. How sad.

458
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,410
事实是...诺尔玛五岁的时候
The plain truth is, I left my wife...

459
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:56,230
我离开了我的妻子
when Norma was five.

460
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,350
我从未想过过我现在的生活
I never wanted the life you see me leading now.

461
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,990
我总是四处旅行
I was always a traveller.

462
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,030
脚痒
Itchy feet.

463
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,270
有一天 我决定...在南非开始新的生活
Well, one day, I decided... to start a new life in Southern Africa.

464
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,430
这是故事很普通 是吧?
That is a story most common, no?

465
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,870
但是玛丽无法面对这个打击
But Mary never got over it.

466
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,220
她变得越来越失常
She became more and more disturbed.

467
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,590
然后 有一天...
And then, one day...

468
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,430
在诺尔玛七岁的时候
...when Norma was seven,

469
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,910
在她的七岁生日那天 
on her seventh birthday, in fact...

470
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,110
我妻子自杀了
...my wife killed herself.

471
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,430
见鬼!
Sapristi!

472
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,870
在她孩子的生日那天?
On the birthday of her child?

473
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,110
我觉得她没有打算自杀
I don't think she intended to kill herself.

474
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,070
我从保姆那里拿到的信上说得很清楚了
The letters I got from old Nanny made that pretty clear.

475
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,830
她打算...让人发现她
She intended... to be found.

476
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,150
然后...救她
And... saved.

477
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,190
告诉我 先生
Tell to me, monsieur,

478
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,230
你妻子的尸体是谁发现的?
who was it who actually discovered the body of your wife?

479
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,550
- 是诺尔玛 - 噢
- Norma did. - Oh.

480
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,750
试想一下那对她造成的影响
Imagine the effect that had on her.

481
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,150
这种事也许只会让成年人悲伤
Such an occurrence would be distressing to the mind of an adult,

482
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,190
但对小孩子来说...
but to that of a child...

483
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,430
先生 我想问问 是什么让你回英格兰的?
May I ask, monsieur, what it was that brought you back to England?

484
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,390
一年前 我哥哥死了 没有继承人
A year ago, my brother died, leaving no heirs.

485
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,630
我不得不结束旅行 回来接管生意
I had to return from my travels to take over the business.

486
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:20,070
所以 我就在这里了 只能在办公桌前卖命
So, here I am, tied to a desk.

487
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,980
这么说 你妻子葬礼之后
So, until last year you have not seen your daughter

488
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,190
你直到去年才见到你的女儿
since the funeral of your wife.

489
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,670
噢 不不 我妻子自杀的时候我出城了
Oh, no, no, I was up country when that happened.

490
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,630
那封信没有及时送到我手中
The letters never reached me in time.

491
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,670
所以你没有参加葬礼
So you did not attend the funeral.

492
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,710
- 没有 - 所以你和女儿团聚时
- No. - So the reunion with your daughter,

493
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,150
你们一定都很激动
when it happened, must have been full of emotion for you both.

494
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,710
你有孩子吗 波罗先生?
Do you have children, Mr Poirot?

495
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,150
没有
Mais non.

496
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,630
那你就无法想象那有多痛苦
Then you cannot possibly imagine how painful it was.

497
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,990
她看什么都不顺眼
And nothing's been right with her.

498
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,460
她很...生气
She's so full of... rage.

499
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,350
给波罗先生的紧急电话
An urgent call for Monsieur Poirot.

500
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,630
给我的?
For me?

501
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,190
- 我能接通吗? - 我先离开
- Shall I put it through? - I'll let you be private.

502
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,190
谢谢
Merci.

503
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,750
你好 是我 波罗 你是谁?
Hello. It is I, Poirot. Who speaks?

504
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,550
我是达芙妮 甜叶草茶屋的
It's Daphne, from The Merry Shamrock tearooms.

505
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,590
我想你可能打错电话了
I think perhaps you have the wrong number.

506
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,070
奥利弗太太说 我只能跟你说
Mrs Oliver said I was to speak only to you.

507
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,950
所以你的仆人乔治给了我这个号码
So your Mr George gave me this number.

508
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,990
我找到你了 波罗先生
I've tracked you down, Mr Poiry.

509
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,980
我要告诉你一些紧急的事 
I'm to tell you something urgently.

510
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,670
告诉我什么?
Tell to me what?

511
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,870
第三个女孩... 现在处于...
"The third girl... is in danger...

512
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,870
孔雀的危险之中
...from the peacock. "

513
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,430
啊 孔雀
Ah. The peacock.

514
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,890
我要告诉你 
And I was to tell you that

515
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:56,910
奥利弗太太现在正跟踪孔雀去他的画室
Mrs Oliver is now tailing the peacock to his studio.

516
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,990
我知道了 谢谢你
I understand. Thank you very much.

517
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,910
- 希望没什么大事 - 不不不不不
- Nothing serious, I hope. - No, no, no, no, no.

518
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,510
没什么大事
Nothing serious at all.

519
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,430
祝你今天过得愉快 先生 小姐
I wish you good day, monsieur, mademoiselle.

520
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,830
祝你今天过得愉快
Good day.

521
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,070
一切还顺利吗?
Is everything all right?

522
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,030
今晚和我共进晚餐
Have dinner with me tonight.

523
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,910
抱歉!
Excuse me!

524
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,590
老天 我真的不擅长这个
Goodness, I'm really not good at this.

525
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,940
- 你不擅长 是吗? - 噢 老天!
- You're not, are you? - Oh, goodness!

526
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,110
噢 你真让我吃惊! 我不知道你在那儿
Oh, you startled me! I had no idea you were there.

527
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,310
- 你在跟踪我 - 是的 恐怕是的
- You were following me. - Yes, I'm afraid I was.

528
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,470
我是写书的 我写的是侦探小说
You see, I write books. I write detective stories,

529
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,310
我刚刚想到 在现实生活中
and I just got it into my head to see what it would be like

530
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,350
真的跟踪一个人会是什么样的
to tail a real, live person in real, live life.

531
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,790
结果如何呢?
And how was it?

532
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:31,260
- 什么? - 跟踪一个真实的人
- What? - Tailing a real, live person.

533
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,270
噢...这比你想象的难多了
Oh... it's much harder than you think.

534
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,470
你也许会生气 但这完全没必要
You're probably frightfully angry, but there's really no need.

535
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,410
我会... 
I'll toddle...

536
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:39,980
你当时也在聚会上 是吗?
You were at the party, weren't you?

537
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:43,550
喋喋不休地说现代小说的退化
Boring everybody stiff about the decline of the modern novel.

538
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,550
然后你也在咖啡厅
And then you were in the cafè, too.

539
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,230
你不想看看我要去哪里吗?
Well, don't you want to see where I was going?

540
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,710
你不想跟踪我...一路到底吗?
Don't you want to follow me... all the way to the end?

541
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:56,190
为什么不在那里转转...嗯?
Why not toddle up there... hm?

542
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,790
噢
Oh.

543
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,590
谢谢
Thank you.

544
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,390
进来吧 别不好意思
Come in. Don't be shy.

545
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,790
欢迎光临寒舍
Welcome to my humble abode.

546
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,070
噢! 这是你家吗?
Oh! Is this yours?

547
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,420
"要求堕胎的女孩"
Girl Demanding An Abortion.

548
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,990
- 你觉得怎么样? - 噢 亲爱的
- What do you think? - Oh, dear.

549
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,390
啊 在这儿 和以前一样锐利 我懂了
Ah, here already. Keen as ever, I see.

550
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,030
奥利弗太太 我们又见面了
Mrs Oliver, our paths cross again.

551
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,090
凯瑞小姐 对不起 我刚才没认出你
Miss Cary, I'm so sorry, I didn't recognise you at first,

552
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:43,350
你没有...没有...
 without your... without any...

553
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,750
- 没有穿衣服? - 是的 全裸
- Without my clothes on? - Yes. Completely naked.

554
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,530
奥利弗太太很好心的
Mrs Oliver kindly came round to the apartment

555
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:51,030
把要给诺尔玛看的小说拿过来
to leave a novel for Norma to read.

556
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,670
是吗? 真好
Did she? That was kind.

557
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,710
真是一系列的巧合啊
What a series of coincidences.

558
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,820
我就在那里 在茶室里 
And there I was, in the tearoom,

559
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,270
诺尔玛和大卫当时正在喝咖啡
when Norma and David were having a cup of coffee.

560
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,100
真的吗? 
Were you really?

561
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,780
是的 事实上 我们都在那里
Yes, we were, as a matter of fact.

562
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,390
非同寻常的巧合
Extraordinary coincidence.

563
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,510
然后她想试试在现实生活中跟踪别人感觉如何
And then she decided to see what it would be like in real life to follow someone.

564
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:13,000
在伦敦的这么多人当中 她选择了我 
And of all the people in London, she chose me.

565
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,630
额 不是...
Well, that's not quite how...

566
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:18,070
你喜欢你的这次生活调剂吗 奥利弗太太?
And how are you enjoying your slice of real life, Mrs Oliver?

567
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,750
你知道吗 这太有趣了
Do you know, it's absolutely fascinating.

568
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,830
好吧 我不想耽误你的时间
Well, I don't want to take up any more of your time.

569
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,950
我给你倒杯酒吧? 
Can I offer you a drink?

570
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,830
谢谢 但我不喝酒
Thank you so much, but I don't drink.

571
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,310
噢 这位女士不喝酒 谁想得到啊?
Oh, the lady doesn't drink. Who'd have thought it?

572
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,260
你知道你在哪吗? 
Do you know where you are?

573
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,990
知道 知道 我没事的
Yes, yes, I'll be fine.

574
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:41,220
噢 你的画真的很不错 让人印象深刻
Oh, your paintings are really very good. Terribly impressive draughtsmanship.

575
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,430
噢 标题我也很喜欢
Oh, and I like the title, too.

576
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,940
"要求堕胎的女孩"
Girl Demanding An Abortion.

577
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,510
公众会有热烈反响的
I think the public will respond.

578
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,270
右边还是左边?
Right or left?

579
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,180
什么 乔治?
Yes, George?

580
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,750
门房终于回电话了 先生
The concierge finally answered the telephone, sir.

581
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,900
今天稍早奥利弗太太离开布洛丁法院后 
He hasn't seen Mrs Oliver since earlier today,

582
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,110
他就没见过她了
 when she left Boradine Court.

583
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,150
他说她离开得很匆忙
She left in a great hurry, he says.

584
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,830
女士们
Les femmes.

585
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,190
这次应该是奥利弗女士了 乔治
That will be Madame Oliver now, George.

586
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,830
让她进来
Please to show her in.

587
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,360
快过来 波罗先生!
Come quickly, Monsieur Poirot!

588
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,030
你能救我吗? 求你了
Can you save me? Please.

589
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,070
求你了

590
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,070
- 波罗先生 - 早上好 女士
- Monsieur Poirot. - Good morning, mademoiselle.

591
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,630

- Am I in your apartment? - Oui, bien s?r.

592
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,590
我的医生只给你打了一点镇定剂
You know, my doctor gave to you only the little sedative,

593
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,750
你已经睡了十四个小时了
and you have slept for 14 hours.

594
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,750
- 有谁知道我在这? - 没有别人了
- Who knows I'm here? - No other person.

595
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,710
当然 除了我的医生和仆人乔治
Except, of course, for my doctor and mon valet, George.

596
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,830
你现在很安全 雷斯塔里克小姐
You are quite safe, Mademoiselle Restarick.

597
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,240
但是 你为什么觉得需要找我
But why did you feel the need to see me

598
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,430
谈施格兰姆女士的谋杀案?
about the murder of Mademoiselle Seagram?

599
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,710
这么说 你相信我? 其他人都不信
You believe me, then? Nobody else wants to.

600
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,350
我毫不怀疑她是被谋杀的
I have no doubt that she was murdered.

601
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,510
告诉我 女士
But tell to me, mademoiselle,

602
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,340
你为什么觉得是你杀了施格兰姆保姆?
why do you feel that it was you yourself who murdered Nanny Seagram?

603
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,070
这样的事以前在你身上也发生过吗?
Has anything of this nature ever happened to you before?

604
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,110
没有
No.

605
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,950
我现在想离开了 
I'd like to leave now.

606
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,110
不不不 我请你留下来
No, no, no, I implore you to stay.

607
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,270
你是来寻求我的帮助的 我会帮你的
You came looking for my help and that is what I am giving to you.

608
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,060
我不想要你的帮助 我想离开 
I don't want your help, I want to go.

609
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,030
离开去哪里呢?
But to go where?

610
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,310
女士 现在没有其他地方对你来说是安全的
Mademoiselle, there is no other place that is safe for you just now.

611
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,470
你和你的舅父关系密切吗 雷斯塔里克小姐?
Do you feel close to your great-uncle, Sir Roderick?

612
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,940
他以前常和我在一起 
He used to have time for me,

613
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,510
但现在只和索尼娅在一起
 but now he only has time for Sonia.

614
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,550
啊 从什么时候开始 她成了她的...
Ah. And how long has she been his...

615
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,630
...伴侣?
...companion?

616
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,260
她大概半年前来到十字树篱庄园
She arrived at Crosshedges about... six months ago.

617
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,310
我知道了
I see.

618
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,550
罗德里克先生是何时开始失明的?
When did Sir Roderick lose his sight?

619
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,550
他的视力一向不好
It was never good.

620
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,910
大概是十年前完全失明的
It failed completely about 10 years ago.

621
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,470
嗯
Hm.

622
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,350
打扰一下 先生
Excuse me, sir.

623
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,230
稍等 是乔治 我的仆人 也是大厨
Parfait! George, mon valet, is also the chef exceptionnel.

624
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,750
请坐 女士 接下来几天 我们需要你坚强点
Please eat, mademoiselle. We need you to be strong over the next few days.

625
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,830
- 为什么? - 你就吃吧 我们晚点再谈
- Why? - Just eat, and we will talk some more.

626
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,990
抓住孔雀
Catch the peacock.

627
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,600
如果我死了 告诉警察...
Tell the police in the event of my death...

628
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,350
你的头被打了 奥利弗太太
You've been hit on the head, Mrs Oliver.

629
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,350
- 你是谁? - 谁?
- Who are you? - Who?

630
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,430
- 谁? - 谁打了你的头?
- Who? - Who hit you on the head?

631
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,430
你是谁?
Who are you?

632
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,230
啊 我知道你是谁
Ah, I know who you are.

633
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,870
我不可能认错你的胡子
Couldn't mistake those moustaches anywhere.

634
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,390
你在这儿干什么? 我在哪里?
What are you doing here? Where am I?

635
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,270
我警告过你小心点的 女士
I warned you to be careful, chère madame.

636
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,350
哦...我的头好痛
Oh... my head aches.

637
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,670
你是被钝器打伤的 女士
You've been hit with a blunt instrument, madam.

638
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,390
你的手提袋里的东西被偷了
And the contents of your handbag have been stolen.

639
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,390
- 是孔雀偷的 - 她精神错乱了
- By the peacock. - She's delirious.

640
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,070
- 不 我没有 - 我保证 她一定是的
- No, I'm not. - I assure you, this is how she is.

641
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,140
告诉我 女士 你确实看到孔雀袭击你了吗?
Talk to me, madame. Did you actually see the peacock strike you?

642
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,070
这很重要
 This is important.

643
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,420
她的记忆力可能有问题
She may have difficulty remembering things.

644
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,910
胡说1
Nonsense!

645
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,990
每件事我都记得很清楚
I remember everything vividly.

646
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,790
有一个"要求堕胎的女孩" 
There was a Girl Demanding An Abortion.

647
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:36,870
那个女孩是谁?
Who was this girl?

648
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,910
虽然我看来不是那么回事
Though it didn't look like that to me.

649
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,410
是第二个女孩 
It was the second girl.

650

有两个女孩要求堕胎?
There were two girls demanding abortions?

651

你确实看到孔雀袭击你了吗?

652
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,150
不 我什么也没看到

653
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,190
事情发生得太快了
It all flew by so quickly.

654
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,270
你还记得你的手提包里有什么吗?

655
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,310
我要睡觉了
I think I'll go to sleep now.

656

祝你今天愉快
I bid you good day.

658
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,190
是孔雀飞得很快吗?
Was it the... peacock that flew by quickly?

659
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,710
它们不是用跳的吗?
They jump, don't they?

660
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,560
- 你有访客 先生 - 嘘 乔治
- You have a visitor, sir. - Ssh, George.

661
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:19,030

很高兴见到你 罗德里克先生

- Mademoiselle. - Monsieur Poirot. A delight to see you again.

666

真神奇 有个朋友给我打了电话 
Wonderful thing, a telephone.

667
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:36,710
伦敦警察厅的高官 他告诉了我你的事
 Rang a friend, top brass, Scotland Yard. He told me all about you.

668
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,870
很高兴你还记得我的名字
I am gratified that you even remembered my name.

669
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,190
请坐
Please to sit.

670
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:45,430
是索尼娅记得 小个子 大胡子
Sonia remembered it. Little chap, big moustache.

671
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,630
很显然 你是我们的第一大侦探
Apparently, you're our number one sleuth.

672
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,870
我在我的行业还不算失败
I have not been entirely unsuccessful in my profession.

673
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,270
就是这么回事 我有工作给你
That's the ticket. Got a job for you.

674
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,350
但我恐怕 我现在的时间都占满了
But I regret that my time, it is fully occupied at the present.

675
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,110
照顾诺尔玛 是吗? 
Looking after Norma, aren't you?

676
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:02,830
我可不记得我这么说过
Ah, I do not remember saying that.

677
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,870
你问过和她有关的问题 
You asked questions about her.

678
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:06,710
看吧 你骗不了索尼娅
You can't fool Sonia, you see.

679
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,190
是的
No, indeed.

680
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,380
不管怎样 我认为你不能解决诺尔玛的问题
Anyway, don't think you can solve the Norma problem.

681
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,710
你不能 没人能
 You can't. No-one can.

682
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,550
可怜的孩子 一生的精神都不太正常
Poor girl's had a screw loose all her life.

683
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:20,110
但是诺尔玛会没事的 只要她能守住她的钱
But Norma will be fine, as long as she can hold onto her money.

684
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,230
她为什么会守不住呢?
Why should she not hold onto it?

685
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:26,590
因为有一个叫做大卫・贝克的小混蛋
Because there's a nasty little blighter called David Baker.

686
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,110
在帆布上做画
Daubs canvases.

687
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,350
索尼娅和我觉得他就是冲着钱来的
Sonia and I think he's after the money.

688
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,430
我希望你尽量多的帮我找出他的消息
I want you to find out as much as you can about him.

689
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,350
- 我会付你一大笔钱 - 我愿意试试
- I'll pay you handsomely. - I will try.

690
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,030
作为回报 也许你能帮我
And, in return, perhaps you might help me.

691
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,750
A J 巴特斯比这个名字有什么意思?
What does it mean to you the name A J Battersby?

692
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,950
你为什么...会问起她?
Why do you... ask about her?

693
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,380
她是女的 然后呢? 
She is a woman, then?

694
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,190
啊 是的 她确实是个女人
Oh, yes. Yes, she's a woman, all right.

695
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,550
诺尔玛还小时 请她当了几个月家庭教师
She taught Norma privately for a few months, when she was a little girl.

696
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,860
她经营自己的学校 之后 
Ran her own school. After that,

697
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:03,070
诺尔玛母亲过世后 我们送她去那里了
we sent Norma there after her mother died.

698
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,790
她不能待在十字树篱庄园了 你明白的
She couldn't stay at Crosshedges, you see.

699
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,510
啊 是的 我明白了 谢谢
Ah, yes, I see. Merci.

700
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,070
哦! 哈!
Oh! Ha!

701
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:16,350
对了 呃... 这周末我们有个小家庭派对
Yes, um... we're having a little house party this weekend.

702
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,030
- 也许你乐意来 - 我深感荣幸
- Perhaps you'd like to come. - I would be most honoured.

703
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:21,270
- 呃...你有女伴吗? - 没有
- Um... Do you have a woman in tow? - Non.

704
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,390
- 好吧 反正要带一个 - 啊
- Well, bring her along anyway. - Ah.

705
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,610
我能相信你吧 波罗 
Can I rely on you, Purot?

706
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,550
是的 当然 罗德里克先生
Yes, of course, Sir Roderick.

707
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,110
- 再会 小姐 - 先生 
- Au revoir. Mademoiselle. - Monsieur.

708
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,870
拜拜 先生 谢谢你
Goodbye, sir. Thank you.

709
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,550
你对这位年轻小姐有什么看法 乔治?
What is your opinion of that young lady, George?

710
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,300
呃 先生 如果让我说的话 我觉得他很爱她
Well, sir, if you'll allow me, I would reply that he'd got it badly.

711
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,350
很爱她 如果可以这么说的话 先生
Very badly, if I may say so, sir.

712
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,560
当然 像他这个年纪的先生 这很常见 
It's not unusual, of course, in gentlemen of that age.

713
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,310
是的 乔治 那这位年轻小姐呢?
Yes, George, but what of the young lady?

714
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,700
啊 好吧 先生 她很特别
Oh, well, sir, she's quite a definite type.

715
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,510
我没法具体说出是什么
There's never anything you could put your finger on,

716
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,190
但...他们知道自己在干什么 
but... they know what they're doing, I'd say.

717
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,750
嗯
Mm.

718
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,870
- 啊 去邦德街 - 好的 先生
- Ah. Bond Street. - Right, sir.

719
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,910
呃? 对此你怎么看?
Well? What do you make of that?

720
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:30,230
这个法国佬没有他自己想象的那么聪明!
The little Frog's not nearly as brainy as he thinks!

721
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,290
但是 只要他能帮我们
However, if he can help me

722
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:38,870
阻止那个...画匠就行了
stop that er... canvas dauber in his tracks, all well and good.

723
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,430
谁是我的小机灵 机灵鬼?
Who's my clever, clever man?

724
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:45,990
现在 我们今天的任务结束了吧?
Now, shall we conclude the day's business?

725
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,390
我最近和你父亲谈过
I spoke with your father recently.

726
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,000
- 你为他工作 这... - 不 不
- You're working for him, is that... - No, no.

727
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,030
我只是想见见他而已
I wanted to meet him merely.

728
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:57,630
他告诉我说 
He told to me that

729
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:59,870
是他请求克劳迪娅・瑞斯・霍兰德小姐
he asked Mademoiselle Claudia Reece-Holland

730
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,470
让你成为第三个租客的
for you to be the third girl.

731
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,870
他不需要问 因为那套公寓是公司的
He didn't have to ask. The company owns the apartment.

732
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:05,900
啊
Ah.

733
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,630
保姆的公寓也是 当然
And Nanny's, of course.

734
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,590
你和瑞斯・霍兰德小姐是朋友吗?
And you and Mademoiselle Reece-Holland have become friends?

735
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,630
我没有朋友
I have no friends.

736
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,870
我曾以为我有大卫
I thought I had David.

737
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,910
贝克先生?
Monsieur Baker?

738
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,470
你很爱他 对吧?
You have fallen very much in love with him, no?

739
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,980
我只是犯傻而已 
I was just being silly.

740
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:26,470
我真是太天真了 居然会相信他
 It was naive of me to confide in him.

741
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,630
诺尔玛 你确实是个很可爱的女孩
You know, Norma, you really are a lovely girl.

742
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,750
特别是你笑的时候
Especially when you smile.

743
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,350
我现在是不是该心怀感动?
Is my heart supposed to melt now?

744
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,150
他一定认为我是个很容易得手的女孩
He must have thought me an easy catch.

745
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,470
当我去他的画室时 才意识到我有多么蠢
I only realised what a fool I'd been when I went to his studio.

746
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,830
诺尔玛! 不是你想的那样
Norma! This isn't what you think.

747
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,430
小姐
Mademoiselle,

748
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:09,270
你父亲告诉我 你母亲是自杀的
your father told to me about the day your mother died and... that she killed herself.

749
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:15,350
她的死对你的影响很大
And that the tragic nature of her death has marked you deeply.

750
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,030
我想 女士...
I beg of you, mademoiselle...

751
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,060
...你是否能确切的告诉我 
...can you tell to me exactly

752
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:24,030
那天的事你还记得多少?
what you remember about that day so terrible?

753
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,550
我们已经迟了 诺尔玛
We're late already, Norma.

754
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:33,070
你妈说得很迫切 很严肃...
She was so very insistent. Your mummy said, very strictly...

755
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,830
求你啦! 求求你啦! 只要一个冰激凌!
Please, please, please! Just one ice cream!

756
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,070
妈妈不会介意的 今天是我生日
Mummy won't mind. It's my birthday.

757
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:41,310
她让我们马上回去准备派对 
She wants us to return promptly to be ready for the party.

758
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,310
妈妈! 妈妈! 妈妈!
Mummy! Mummy! Mummy!

759
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,870
妈妈! 看我给你带什么了!
Mummy! Look what I got you!

760
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,230
你能救救我吗?
Can you save me?

761
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,270
但我没能救她!
But I couldn't save her!

762
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,070
你今天怎么样 小姐? 你什么都没吃
How are you today, mademoiselle? You have not eaten.

763
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:53,310
你很热情 波罗先生 但我得离开了
You have been very hospitable, Monsieur Poirot, but I should leave.

764
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,470
但你现在离开 能去哪里呢?
But if you left now, where would you go?

765
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,980
去十字树篱庄园 也许?
To Crosshedges, perhaps?

766
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,370
是的 那里有我所有快乐的记忆 
Yes. All those happy memories.

767
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:01,740
当然有快乐的时光
Surely there were some happy times?

768
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,110
小女孩脸上带着微笑的时光?
Times when there was a smile on the face of that little girl?

769
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,310
杀害母亲的小女孩
The little girl who killed her own mother.

770
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,590
不 小姐 你母亲是自杀的
Non, mademoiselle, your mother killed herself.

771
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,590
我本可以救她的
I could have saved her.

772
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,630
迟到是我的错
It was my fault for being late.

773
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,790
没人会原谅我
Nobody ever forgave me.

774
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,830
这就是你想从施格兰姆保姆那里
Is that what you wanted

775
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:23,110
得到的吗? 原谅?
from Nanny Seagram? Forgiveness?

776
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,630
你上次见到施格兰姆保姆是什么时候?
When was the last time that you saw Nanny Seagram?

777
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,430
她死的那天晚上
On the night she died.

778
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,350
克劳迪娅说她留了个口信给我 要我去找她
Claudia said she left a message to go and see her.

779
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,450
啊 天呐 诺尔玛 
Oh, God, Norma,

780
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:37,860
我给全忘了 施格兰姆小姐
I completely forgot. Miss Seagram.

781
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:42,230
她下午来找你了 她说想和你谈谈你母亲的事
She popped up to see you this afternoon. She said she wanted to talk about your mother.

782
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,270
我母亲?
Talk about my mother?

783
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:48,990
你记得发生什么了吗? 她给你开门了吗?
And can you remember exactly what happened? Did she open to you the door?

784
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,030
我记不得了
I can't remember.

785
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,670
不 她没有应门铃 但门是开着的
No, she didn't answer the bell, but the door was open.

786
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,710
你发现什么了?
And what did you find?

787
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,380
我手上有一把刀
I had a knife in my hand.

788
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,430
不
Non.

789
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,070
你习惯性带刀吗?
Do you habitually carry a knife?

790
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,390
它曾在我的抽屉里
It was in my drawer.

791
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,710
我一打开抽屉 刀就在那里
I opened it, and there it was, just lying there.

792
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,750
你记得自己放过刀吗?
Do you remember putting it there?

793
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,910
没有
No.

794
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,750
那你带着刀了吗?
So did you take the knife with you?

795
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,150
呃 我...
Well, I...

796
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,110
我肯定是这样做了 因为后来刀不在那里了
I must have done. It wasn't there later.

797
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,150
小姐 你能告诉我 进入施格兰姆小姐房间后
Mademoiselle, can you tell to me exactly what you found

798
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,790
你发现了什么吗?
when entering the apartment of Mademoiselle Seagram?

799
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,990
她死了 不是吗? 而我拿着一把刀
She's dead, isn't she? And I had a knife.

800
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,870
打扰一下 先生 
Excuse me, sir.

801
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:44,990
不 乔治 请不要在这一刻打扰我们!
No, George, please, not just at this moment!

802
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,230
纳尔森警长来了 先生
Inspector Nelson is here, sir.

803
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,790
- 还有奥利弗夫人. - 警察?
- And Mrs Oliver. - The police?

804
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,300
很好 我要告诉他们 我要自首 
Good. I want to talk to them. I want to confess.

805
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,460
不 不 不!
No, no, no!

806
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,060
不 请不要这样做 小姐 请你 等我一下
No, please, I beg of you, mademoiselle. Wait for me. Please.

807
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,110
我们稍后再谈
We will talk more of this.

808
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,670
你只需要相信我
Only trust me.

809
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,390
啊! 奥利弗夫人!
Ah! Madame Oliver!

810
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,950
警长 你康复了 
Inspector. You are recovered, I see.

811
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:23,750
完全康复了 谢谢你
Fully, thank you.

812
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,230
- 我记忆也恢复了 - 啊!
- And my memory has returned. - Ah!

813
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,590
- 那封信 - 信?
- The letter. - The letter?

814
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,630
施格兰姆小姐的遗书
Miss Seagram's suicide note.

815
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,030
我在她的镜子后面发现的
I found it behind the mirror in her flat.

816
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,640
"如果我死了 请交给警察 "
"To be given to the police in the event of my death. "

817
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,100
不 不 这不可能
No, no. Pardon. That cannot be.

818
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:38,950
你的意思是她在信中说要自杀吗?
Are you saying that in this letter she announced her suicide?

819
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,030
我还没来得及看就被偷走了
I didn't have time to read it before it was stolen from my handbag.

820
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,190
那你怎么知道是遗书呢?
So how could you know it was a note of suicide?

821
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,950
- 还能是什么呢? - 还有其他什么吗?
- What else could it have been? - What else indeed?

822
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,470
你总是把事情弄得很复杂! 我又头疼了
You always want to make everything so difficult! I'm getting a headache.

823
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,950
警长 你带了我要的消息吗?
Inspector, have you brought to me the information that I requested?

824
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,380
你想要的都在这儿了
You'll find everything you wanted in here.

825
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:59,430
尽管不知道它还有什么用
Though what it matters now, I couldn't guess.

826
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,070
警长 发生什么了?
Inspector, something has happened?

827
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:07,150
- 看起来好像不是自杀 波罗 - 啊
- It seems it wasn't suicide after all, Poirot. - Ah.

828
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:11,670
验尸报告说施格兰姆小姐是死于窒息
Results of the post-mortem indicate that Miss Seagram died of asphyxiation.

829
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,190
她的手腕是死后才被割开的
Her wrists were cut after she'd stopped breathing.

830
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,830
该死!
Sapristi!

831
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,530
还有 诺尔玛・雷斯塔里克的室友
What's more, Norma Restarick's flatmate,

832
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:21,470
克劳迪娅・瑞斯・霍兰德
 Claudia Reece-Holland,

833
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,110
前几天找过我
visited me a couple of days ago,

834
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:27,870
她说诺尔玛对她父亲都坦白了
and she told me Norma had made a clean breast of the business to her father.

835
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,190
- 啊 - 她还说他相信诺尔玛
- Ah. - She also said that he believed

836
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:34,910
也向你坦白罪行了 波罗
the girl had made the same confession to you, Poirot.

837
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,750
纯属好奇 呃? 你好像有什么隐瞒我
Just curiosity, eh? Seems you've been deceiving me.

838
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,750
不好意思 但请先等我一下
Je suis dèsolè. But do indulge me, if you please, for one moment.

839
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,910
你是否还记得雷斯塔里克先生的秘书
Can you remember exactly when it was

840
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,740
是什么时候说他女儿是凶手吗?
the secretary to Monsieur Restarick denounced his daughter as a murderess?

841
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:49,650
两天前 
It was two days ago.

842
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:51,950
两天前? 正是我遭攻击的那天
Two days? That was when I was attacked.

843
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,610
你知道诺尔玛现在在哪里吗 波罗? 
Do you have any idea where this girl is, Poirot?

844
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:55,990
我不能让你进去!
I cannot allow you in there!

845
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,990
你不要拦我! 我在这里
You can't stop me! I'm here.

846
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,950
我就是诺尔玛・雷斯塔里克
I'm Norma Restarick.

847
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,990
我杀了施格兰姆保姆
I killed Nanny Seagram.

848
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:08,910
诺尔玛・雷斯塔里克 我现在以谋杀罪逮捕你
Norma Restarick, I am arresting you on a charge of murder.

849
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,670
谢谢你对我的帮助
Thank you for trying to help me.

850
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,790
对此我持保留态度 波罗
I take a very dim view of this, Poirot.

851
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,170
先生 我第一次见到这位小姐时
If you will, sir, the first time I clapped eyes on her

852
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:24,230
就觉得她很有爱心
 I thought the young lady had birds in her attic.

853
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,270
非常感谢你 乔治
Thank you very much, George.

854
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,310
两杯咖啡 谢谢
Coffee for two, if you please.

855
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,430
现在 我有一大堆的事需要弄清楚
Now, then, there are a lot of things I'd like to know.

856
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:36,980
我没理解错的话
Am I to understand that

857
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:39,780
诺尔玛・雷斯塔里克一直都和你呆在一起?
 Norma Restarick has been with you all this time?

858
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,870
是的 不然还能在哪?
Oui, bien s?r. Where else?

859
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,830
你对于她被捕一点都不关心
You seem completely unconcerned at her arrest.

860
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,950
一点都不 只是不幸而已
Not at all. It is unfortunate.

861
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,510
她在我这待着会更舒服
She would have been much more comfortable remaining here, under my roof.

862
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,270
- 啊 - 那这又是什么?
- Ah. - And what is that?

863
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:00,070
这回答了我去约书亚・雷斯塔里克公司后
This answers a question that has been troubling me

864
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:03,110
一直困扰我的问题
ever since I made a visit to Joshua Restarick, Ltd.

865
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:05,030
到底是什么迷人的问题?
And what is this fascinating question?

866
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,300
呃 很简单
Well, simply this.

867
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:07,880
当我到那的时候 
When I arrived there,

868
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,350
克劳迪娅・瑞斯・霍兰德小姐
Mademoiselle Claudia Reece-Holland was sitting at her desk,

869
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,520
正坐在她的桌子旁补妆 
repairing her maquillage.

870
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,030
桌子上却没有任何信件或文件
 And in front of her, there was no correspondence, no files.

871
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,890
在我拜访期间 电话只响了一次 
And for the duration of my visit, the telephone, it sounded only once,

872
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:20,190
而且还是找我的
 and that was for me

873
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:24,150
达芙妮小姐在甜叶草茶屋帮你打的
from Mademoiselle Daphne on your behalf from The Merry Shamrock tearooms.

874
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:27,590
所以 我请纳尔森警长帮我查了一下
And so, I asked the good Inspector Nelson to make the inquiry.

875
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:29,990
然后呢?
And?

876
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,950
约书亚・雷斯塔里克实际上
Joshua Restarick virtually

877
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:33,710
在两年前就因为生意变差
 ceased trading as a business since two years,

878
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,270
停止交易业务了
after many years in decline.

879
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,710
哦 停!
Oh, do stop!

880
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,750
你又让我头痛了 你知道这对我不好
You're making my head ache again, and you know that's bad for me.

881
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:46,470
夫人 你见过那个女孩微笑吗?
Chère madame, have you ever seen the girl smile?

882
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:47,990
微笑?
Smile?

883
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,070
为什么这么问 见过 
Why, yes.

884
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:50,310
当她看到大卫・贝克的时候
When she saw David Baker.

885
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,550
- 他呢? - 他什么?
- And did he? - Did he what?

886
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,430
对她微笑 我的意思是 他...
Smile at her. I mean, did he...

887
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,830
有没有看她的眼睛?
look her in the eyes?

888
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:03,120
他从未将视线从她身上转开过
He never took his eyes from hers.

889
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:06,230
- 这有什么关系吗? - 当然
- Does it matter? - But of course.

890
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,830
呃 我认为他很不可靠
Well, I think he's unreliable.

891
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:11,870
他在茶室时想对诺尔玛说什么 但没有成功
He was going to show Norma something at the tearooms, but that never materialised.

892
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,590
啊
Ah.

893
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:17,550
你还不觉得她也许不是你想的那样吗?
And has it still not occurred to you that she might be exactly what she appears to be?

894
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,900
我的意思是...她可能是精神病
I mean... criminally insane.

895
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:20,440
夫人 如果你想知道
Chère madame, if you want to know the real truth

896
00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:21,670
关于诺尔玛・雷斯塔里克小姐的真相
about Mademoiselle Norma Restarick,

897
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,190
你得和我一起去个地方
you will accompany me on a journey.

898
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,310
多亏了纳尔森警长的调查
Thanks to the inquiries of the good Inspector Nelson,

899
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,270
我们要去拜访一个她的老朋友
we will meet a very old friend of hers.

900
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,950
带四片阿司匹林应该不算多吧?
Would four aspirin be too much to take, I wonder?

901
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:56,870
您的来电让我很好奇 波罗先生
I was intrigued by your telephone call, Monsieur Poirot.

902
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:59,190
- 我听说过您的大名 当然 - 谢谢
- I have heard of you, of course. - Merci.

903
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:03,510
但在交谈之前我想先了解一些信息
But I should like a little more information before we talk.

904
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,430
好的 
Yes, indeed.

905
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,840
嗯 好的 巴特斯比夫人 
Eh bien, Madame Battersby,

906
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,550
诺尔玛・雷斯塔里克小姐拜访了我
this Mademoiselle Norma Restarick

907
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,160
她向我寻求帮助... 
rendered to me a visit,

908
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,720
呃 她遇到了麻烦...
 and she requested my assistance with... well, some difficulties she...

909
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,220
- 她被指控谋杀 - 谋杀?
- She's been charged with murder. - Murder?

910
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,470
呃...所以 我可不可以先问一下
Um...So firstly, may I ask

911
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,390
诺尔玛・雷斯塔里克小姐是这里的学生时
did you like Mademoiselle Norma Restarick

912
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:27,510
你喜欢她吗?
 when she was here as a pupil?

913
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:30,120
- 所有的女孩子我都喜欢 - 当然
- I like all my girls. - Yes, of course.

914
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,750
那她是一个什么样的女孩呢?
But what sort of girl was she?

915
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,990
学习虽不是很好 但也还中规中矩
Not scholastically brilliant, but adequate.

916
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,990
那之前 你在十字树篱庄园教她时呢?
And before, when you taught her at Crosshedges?

917
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,990
呃 她很小 只有五岁 
Well, she was very young, only five years old,

918
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:40,950
我在那里的工作时间很短
and my appointment was very brief.

919
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,440
出于什么原因呢? 
For what reason?

920
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,150
我有机会开设自己的学校
I had an opportunity to set up my own school.

921
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,990
所以你离开雷斯塔里克家开办自己的学校?
So you left the family Restarick to set up this school?

922
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,070
- 是的 - 这可是冒了很大的险
- Yes. - That was an undertaking most audacious.

923
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:53,990
开始收支很难平衡 但 呃...
It wasn't easy to make ends meet at first, but um...

924
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,990
学校很快就盈利了
the school soon started to pay for itself.

925
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:00,790
可否告诉我 雷斯塔里克小姐喜欢笑吗?
Bon. And tell to me, did Mademoiselle Restarick ever smile?

926
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,060
什么? 
I beg your pardon?

927
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:06,190
他的意思是 她是不是有点神经质
I think he means did she seem a little neurotic?

928
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:10,630
我想你应该知道 波罗先生
I think you're aware, Monsieur Poirot,

929
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:14,220
诺尔玛接受过很多次心理治疗
that Norma's received psychiatric assistance on more than one occasion,

930
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,990
包括她在这里的时候
including whilst she was here.

931
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,790
考虑到她的家庭情况 这也不足为奇
Which is hardly surprising, given her home circumstances.

932
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:22,670
她极度依恋的父亲 
Her father, to whom she'd been extremely attached,

933
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,470
突然离家 呃...
left home suddenly and um...

934
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:29,060
呃 她母亲...没处理好这件事
well, her mother... didn't cope with that very well, I think.

935
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,550
还有她自杀的悲剧
And the tragedy of her suicide.

936
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,440
不 既然你提起这些 
No, since you mention it,

937
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,030
我还真不记得她在母亲死后笑过
 I can't recall Norma ever smiling after the death.

938
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:40,230
她的卧室成了她死去母亲的祭奠室
Her bedroom here became a shrine to her dead mother.

939
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:43,790
在我看来 她一生都在责备自己
It seems to me that she has been blaming herself all of her life.

940
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,720
大多孩子也会这样 不是吗? 
As do most children, non?

941
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:46,430
确实如此
Indeed.

942
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,750
- 当他们不责备自己的父母时 - 是的
- When they're not blaming their parents. - Oui.

943
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,790
你有孩子吗 夫人? 
Do you yourself have children, madame?

944
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:54,070
我没结过婚 波罗先生
I've never married, Monsieur Poirot.

945
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:57,150
哦 对不起... 小姐
Oh, je suis dèsolè... mademoiselle.

946
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:02,590
你说她把自己的卧室当母亲的祭奠室
You say that she kept her room as a shrine to her mother,

947
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,630
但你也说她极度依恋父亲
but you also say that she was extremely attached to her father.

948
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,650
有对父亲的祭奠室吗? 
So there was no shrine to him?

949
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:08,870
有 在她心中
In her heart, yes.

950
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:12,340
她一直相信他会回来
She never gave up hope that he would return.

951
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:17,070
或者会有一封让她去父亲那里的信
Or that a letter would arrive asking her to go out and join him.

952
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,390
但都没有
It never did.

953
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,870
在她心里 是的
In her heart, oui.

954
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,270
但现实中 她房间里有没有呢?
But in reality, in her rooms?

955
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,010
根本没有他父亲的照片 
There wasn't a single photograph of her father,

956
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:26,710
如果你是想知道这个的话
 if that's what you mean.

957
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:30,350
他离开后 她妈妈毁了所有的照片
Her mother destroyed every single one she could find after he left.

958
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,670
事实上 说到母亲 
Really, when it comes to the mother,

959
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:34,070
不能不问自己 在那个屋子里的...
one has to ask oneself, in that house...

960
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,300
...那孩子是谁?
...who was the child?

961
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:40,590
的确 那孩子到底是谁 嗯哼?
Vraiment. Who was the child indeed, huh?

962
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,590
而你也没法拿出一张她爸爸的照片是吗?
And you could not provide her with a photograph of her father?

963
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:45,350
什么 我?
What, me?

964
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,030
我是说 你有没有全家福
From the photographs you took of the family, I mean.

965
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:51,700
哦 明白了 当然 不 不 我没有
Oh, I see. Of course. No. No, I couldn't.

966
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,230
你觉得 我们是不是结束了?
Are we done, do you think?

967
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:56,300
是的
Oui.

968
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:02,870
我读过你所有的小说 奥利弗女士
I have all of your novels, Mrs Oliver.

969
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,150
不知道您能不能在我的书上签个名
And I wonder if you would be so very kind as to sign my copies.

970
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,610
我会感到十分荣幸的 
I really would be so grateful.

971
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:10,660
可以 当然可以
Yes, of course.

972
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,790
- 有笔吗? - 有
- Do you have a pen? - Yes.

973
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:16,340
- 谢谢 真是太高兴了 - 我的荣幸
- Thank you, this is thrilling. - Pleasure.

974
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:21,420
从记录上看 诺尔玛马上就要过25岁生日了
I see from my records that Norma's about to reach her 25th birthday.

975
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,870
鉴于她拥有的财富 她很吸引某些人
She is quite a catch for somebody, given her wealth.

976
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:26,750
玛丽・雷斯塔里克是一个富有的继承人
Mary Restarick was a wealthy heiress,

977
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:28,150
而她把一切都留给了诺尔玛
and she left it all to Norma.

978
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,500
- 她多有钱? - 她死的时候
- How wealthy was she? - At the time of her death,

979
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:34,710
玛丽・雷斯塔里克差不多有七八万英镑
Mary Restarick's fortune was estimated at seven or eight hundred thousand pounds.

980
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:37,350
对了 当然 还有十字树篱庄园
And, of course, there's Crosshedges house, too.

981
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,190
那屋子不是属于罗德里克先生吗? 
The house does not belong to Sir Roderick?

982
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:39,990
哦 当然不是
Oh, no.

983
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,990
他只是沾诺尔玛的光才住在这里
He lives there by the grace of Norma.

984
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,850
如果诺尔玛・雷斯塔里克小姐意外死亡了
So if, by chance,

985
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:45,790
会怎样呢?
Mademoiselle Norma Restarick was to die?

986
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:48,650
好吧 一半的钱会给她的直系亲属
Well, half the money would go to her next of kin,

987
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:51,270
也就是她父亲 除非她结婚了
 her father. Unless she were to marry.

988
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,680
为什么只有一半呢? 
But why only half?

989
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,830
玛丽・雷斯塔里克十分爱十字树篱庄园
Mary Restarick loved Crosshedges.

990
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:59,870
她将另一半的钱留下来作为维护房子的钱
She ensured that half the family money would always go back to the guardian of the estate.

991
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:03,390
那么如果诺尔玛・雷斯塔里克小姐不结婚的话
So if Mademoiselle Norma Restarick was not to marry,

992
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:04,430
钱会给谁?
 that would be?

993
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,990
给她最爱的舅父 罗德里克先生
Her favourite uncle. Old Sir Roderick.

994
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:12,550
谢谢
Merci.

995
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:25,750
你告诉我的索尼娅...
This Sonia woman you told me about...

996
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,340
她显然希望罗德里克先生能够
she's obviously hoping old Roderick will

997
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:30,110
得到诺尔玛妈妈的钱
 come into Norma's mother's money.

998
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,990
你不是说 罗德里克先生
Didn't you tell me Sir Roderick

999
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:35,110
让你干掉大卫・贝克先生吗?
asked you to flush out David Baker?

1000
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,830
- 在我看来... - 我听见了 女士
- I said it seems to me... - I heard you, madame.

1001
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,310
我在思考 这是我的习惯
I am thinking. It is my custom.

1002
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:46,470
哦 就这样? 怎么样?
Oh, is that all? What about?

1003
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:47,570
告诉我 女士 
Tell to me, madame,

1004
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:50,140
当你进入施格兰姆保姆的房间时...
when you entered the apartment of Nanny Seagram...

1005
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:53,430
不顾我特意给你的警告
against the advice that I gave to you most expressly,

1006
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:55,470
但先暂时让我们忽略这一点...
but let us overlook that for now...

1007
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,510
...你是怎么进去的?
...how did you gain the entry?

1008
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:00,150
哦 是门房阿尔夫 
Oh, Alf, the concierge.

1009
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:03,670
他愿意为我做一切 他说他是我的头号粉丝
He'd do anything for me. He's my number one fan, he says.

1010
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,870
很好 他放你进去的?
How gratifying. He let you in?

1011
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,270
是的 但事实上 这是多余的
Yes, but in fact, he didn't need to.

1012
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,270
- 因为门并没有上锁 - 我明白了
- The door had been left unlocked. - I see.

1013
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:13,110
然后 你一进去就发现了那封信?
And, once inside, you just discovered the letter?

1014
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,960
我没告诉你我是怎么发现信的? 
And I didn't tell you how.

1015
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,440
没有
Non.

1016
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,470
真是太聪明了 我说的是我自己
It was terribly clever, although I say it myself.

1017
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,670
我只是问我自己 
I simply asked myself,

1018
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:21,830
"一个女人会把那个藏在..."
"Where would a woman hide... "

1019
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,120
是的 是的 是的 但是还发生了什么吗? 
Yes, yes, yes. But did anything else happen?

1020
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:24,830
好吧...
Well...

1021
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,230
过了一会儿 我就觉得...
for a second, I had the feeling...

1022
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:29,880
...公寓里还有其他人
...that someone was there in the apartment.

1023
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,670
但是当然这只是我的想象
But of course I imagined it.

1024
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:32,780
总之 我跟我自己说 
Anyway, I said to myself,

1025
01:00:32,790 --> 01:00:34,390
"一个女人会把那个藏在..."
 "Where would a woman hide... "

1026
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,110
等等 等等 等等
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1027
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:39,070
你确定那里没有其他人了吗?
Are you sure that there was there no other person?

1028
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:42,630
- 这很重要吗? - 极其的重要 女士
- Does it really matter? - This is of the utmost importance, madame.

1029
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,630
哦 你真让人火大
Oh, you really are the most maddening man.

1030
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:49,070
我不能确定那儿还有没有其他人
I couldn't say for certain one way or the other whether someone else was there.

1031
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:52,740
我冲了出去 去追那第三个女孩
I rushed out, chasing after the third girl.

1032
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,020
啊 对
Ah, bon.

1033
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,990
一切都清楚了
All is becoming clear.

1034
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:03,830
啊! 明白了!
Ah! Gotcha!

1035
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,750
- 罗德里克先生 - 哦 又是你
- Sir Roderick. - Oh, it's you again.

1036
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,250
我带来了雷斯塔里克小姐的画像 
I've brought Miss Restarick's portrait.

1037
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,270
好吧 过来
Well, come here.

1038
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,870
来吧
Come on.

1039
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:20,510
近一点
Closer.

1040
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:29,430
你知道吗 索尼娅...觉得你是个坏蛋
You know, Sonia... thinks you're a bad egg.

1041
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,430
如果这指的是我和诺尔玛
If that refers to me and Norma,

1042
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,270
我可以向你保证 我只在乎她的利益
I can assure you I have only her best interests at heart.

1043
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,510
是的 我知道
Yes, I can see that now.

1044
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,790
你完全不会有任何麻烦的
You're not going to be any trouble at all.

1045
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:43,030
你是个好人!
You're a good egg!

1046
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:45,070
女仆会送你出去
The maid'll see you out.

1047
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,740
你能把东西留在这里
And you can leave that thing here.

1048
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,630
啊 该死!
Oh, damn!

1049
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,990
啊 我亲爱的阿尔夫!
Ah, my dear Alf!

1050
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,270
这是波罗先生
This is Monsieur Poirot.

1051
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,590
- 哦 波罗先生 - 先生
- Oh, Mr Parot! - Monsieur.

1052
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:11,480
告诉我 你是她的粉丝吗? 
Tell me, are you a fan?

1053
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:12,470
是的 当然是
Oui, naturellement.

1054
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,030
你读过她最新的小说吗?
Have you read her latest?

1055
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,350
哦 是的 是的 我可以确定我有
Ah, oui, yes, I am almost sure that I have.

1056
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,790
好吧 也许你可以帮我 我读过四次
Well, maybe you could help me. I've read it four times

1057
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:23,400
而且对于这事儿是谁干的 我还是毫无头绪!
and I've still got no bleeding idea who dunnit!

1058
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,310
- 哦 - 不 不 真是个天才!
- Oh. - No, no, it's genius!

1059
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:28,190
让他们继续猜 额 奥利弗女士?
Keep them guessing, eh, Mrs O?

1060
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,800
额... 阿尔夫先生 请告诉我
Er... Monsieur Alf, tell to me, if you please,

1061
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:33,030
你了解施格兰姆小姐多少?
 how well did you know Mademoiselle Seagram?

1062
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,710
我曾送过杜松子酒给她
I used to deliver her gin for her.

1063
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:37,350
根据纳尔森警长说的 她喝了很多的杜松子酒
According to Inspector Nelson, she drank a lot of gin.

1064
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:38,670
我会说 喝得越来越多 
I'll say. More and more.

1065
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:39,750
从什么时候开始的?
And since when?

1066
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:43,500
比如说 她喝酒是突然一下变多的吗?
For instance, did her liking for the drink increase suddenly?

1067
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:46,630
- 是的 大约最近六个月 - 我知道了
- Yeah, for about the last six months. - I see.

1068
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,670
你还为她做过什么? 
And tell to me, what else did you do for her?

1069
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,870
比如 你给她寄过信吗?
For instance, did you post her letters for her?

1070
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:52,880
她很少收到或是寄信 
She very rarely received or sent letters.

1071
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:55,510
因此对她来说 信件是很难忘的
So for her, they were memorable perhaps.

1072
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:58,670
你有没有偶然在她死前给她寄过信?
Did you, by chance, post a letter for her shortly before her death?

1073
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,630
哦 是的 有的 就在前一天!
Oh, yes, I did. The day before!

1074
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:06,220
那你有没有偶然注意到 这信是给谁的?
And did you notice, of course by chance, to whom the letter was addressed?

1075
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,070
这很重要
This is most important.

1076
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:10,630
- 好吧 我确实看到了 - 啊!
- Well, it did catch my eye. - Ah!

1077
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:11,710
是给安德鲁... 
It was for Mr Andrew...

1078
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:12,750
雷斯塔里克 是吗?
Restarick, non?

1079
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,790
- 对的 - 嗯
- Correct. - Mm.

1080
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:17,910
她是不是还有很多的访客?
Did she receive many visitors?

1081
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,260
好吧 那个可爱的女孩 诺尔玛
Well, that funny girl, Norma.

1082
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,550
她以前常常来这里
She used to be up there quite a lot.

1083
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:26,630
有时是她的父亲 雷斯塔里克先生
Sometimes her father, Mr Restarick.

1084
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:29,110
啊 好的
Ah. Bon.

1085
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,790
你有访客 先生
A visitor, sir.

1086
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:46,830
啊...贝克先生
Ah... Monsieur Baker.

1087
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,310
我正等你呢
I was expecting you.

1088
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,510
谢谢 乔治
Merci, George.

1089
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:01,310
我欠你一个解释
I owe you an explanation.

1090
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:03,350
你没有欠我什么
You owe to me nothing.

1091
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,320
我想让你看看这个 
I'd like you to look at this.

1092
01:04:13,330 --> 01:04:14,990
我向你保证没有必要了
I assure you that there is no need.

1093
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:17,790
我知道这是什么 我不需要看
I know what it is, and it is not I who needs to see it.

1094
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:22,470
我想我们第一次在十字树篱庄园见面的那天
I believe you have had this in your possession

1095
01:04:22,470 --> 01:04:23,990
这东西就在你手里了
since we first met that day at Crosshedges.

1096
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,320
你应该是准备在甜叶草茶屋
You could have shown it to Mademoiselle Restarick

1097
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,790
把这个给雷斯塔里克小姐看的
 at The Merry Shamrock tearooms,

1098
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:31,110
但你没有
and yet you did not.

1099
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:34,190
她看起来如此脆弱
She seemed so fragile.

1100
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,150
我不知道她会有什么反应
I didn't know how she might react.

1101
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,870
贝克先生 诺尔玛小姐不是她母亲!
Monsieur Baker, Mademoiselle Norma is not her mother!

1102
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,260
诺尔玛
Norma.

1103
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:55,350
如果我告诉你我爱你 你相信吗?
If I told you I was in love with you, would you believe me?

1104
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:00,670
有时...我们看见的并不是真相
Sometimes... we see what isn't really there.

1105
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:05,100
我和弗朗西丝之间什么都没有
Nothing happened between me and Frances.

1106
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,030
我要给你看一些东西
I have to show you something.

1107
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:41,940
小姐... 我希望你能相信我
Mademoiselle... I asked you to trust me.

1108
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:45,790
可以吗?
Will you?

1109
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:52,060
好的
Bon.

1110
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:04,900
谢谢
Merci.

1111
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,070
拉!
Pull!

1112
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,230
看着 我闭着眼睛都能做到
Watch this. I'll do it blind.

1113
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:21,030
拉!
Pull!

1114
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,910
看那里
Look over there.

1115
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,340
你还好吗 奥利弗女士? 
How are you, Mrs Oliver?

1116
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:33,230
哦! 弗朗西丝
Oh! Frances.

1117
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:34,420
小姐
Mademoiselle.

1118
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,470
我真心希望你已经康复
I do hope you've recovered.

1119
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,430
哦 头被打了的事
Oh, from the bump on the head.

1120
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:43,070
不 是看见我的裸体的震惊
No. From the shock of seeing me in the buff.

1121
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,040
如果大厅里的画是未完成的 
If the painting in the hall is anything to go by,

1122
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:51,190
那么雷斯塔里克先生的第一任太太真是个美人
 Mr Restarick's first wife was quite a looker.

1123
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:53,700
当然 就像克劳迪娅提醒每个人的那样 
Of course, that was all a long time ago,

1124
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:55,070
这是很久以前的事情了
 as Claudia keeps reminding everyone.

1125
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:57,230
也许他另娶了一个妻子...
Perhaps he'll gain a wife...

1126
01:07:57,230 --> 01:07:59,190
就在他失去一个女儿的时候
just as he loses a daughter.

1127
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:13,030
来一杯吗 先生? 女士?
Drink, sir? Madam?

1128
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,390
安德鲁
Andrew.

1129
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:47,990
你是谁?
Who are you?

1130
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,470
我说 你是谁?
I said, who are you?

1131
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:56,270
我是你父亲 诺尔玛
I'm your father, Norma.

1132
01:08:58,040 --> 01:08:59,260
她在这里做什么?
What's she doing here?

1133
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:01,470
诺尔玛 你还好吗?
Norma, are you all right?

1134
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:05,150
但我以为... 我们都以为...
But I thought... we all thought...

1135
01:09:05,150 --> 01:09:06,310
你们以为什么?
What did you think?

1136
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:09,630
亲爱的诺尔玛 不要紧张
Darling Norma, please try not to get overwrought.

1137
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:13,990
好吧 好吧! 你是来搞破坏的 是吧?
Well, well! Come to spoil another party, have you?

1138
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:17,310
警察们在干什么 就这样放了她?
What are the police playing at, letting her out?

1139
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:19,070
- 住嘴! - 噢!
- Shut up! - Ow!

1140
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,790
- 诺尔玛! - 诺尔玛!
- Norma! - Norma!

1141
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:23,910
很抱歉 我只是...我只是不明白!
I'm sorry, I just... I just don't understand!

1142
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,790
警察放了我 爸爸 我自由了
The police let me go, Daddy. I'm free.

1143
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:28,230
真是...真是太棒了
That's... That's wonderful.

1144
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:30,790
罗迪叔叔如果看见你在这儿会高兴的
Uncle Roddy will be so happy that you're here.

1145
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:34,030
亲爱的女孩 你让我想起了你妈妈
Darling girl, you remind me so much of your mother.

1146
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:36,390
如果她能在这儿看见你
If only she were here to see you now.

1147
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,590
你是谁?
Who are you?

1148
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:46,150
- 哦 我的天呐 她疯了! - 诺尔玛!
- Oh, my God, she's insane! - Norma!

1149
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:52,910
- 她还好吗? - 当然
- Is she all right? - Parfaitement.

1150
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:55,630
她正在处理萦绕在她心头的记忆
She is dealing with the memories that haunt her.

1151
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:58,110
她能扛过去吗?
But is she strong enough to go through this?

1152
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,150
游戏该结束了
Let the game be played out.

1153
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:18,860
诺尔玛! 这只会让事情越来越糟
Norma! This is only making things worse for yourself.

1154
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:21,710
你在浪费你的时间 弗朗西丝
You're wasting your time, Frances.

1155
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,990
你疯了 是吗?
You really are insane, aren't you?

1156
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:29,390
我不想和你说话! 我不想和任何人说话!
I don't want to talk to you! I don't want to talk to anyone any more!

1157
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:36,630
- 干杯!  - 大卫 亲爱的 干杯!
- Cheers! - David, darling, cheers!

1158
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:38,670
我能...我能打扰一下吗?
May I... May I interrupt?

1159
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:41,430
请安静一下! 罗德里克先生有话要说!
Quieten down, please! Sir Roderick wishes to speak!

1160
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:43,950
- 哦 谢谢
- Oh. Thank you.

1161
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,230
第一 我感谢你们在这特殊的日子前来
First, I'd like to thank you all for coming here on this special day.

1162
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:53,310
特别是诺尔玛再次回到了我们身边
Especially Norma, who is back with us again.

1163
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:57,550
而现在 我邀请你们所有人来的原因
And now, the reason I invited you all here.

1164
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,830
会让你们中的一些人吃惊...而一些人不会
Something that will surprise some of you and... not others.

1165
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,030
两周前 我向我的秘书
Two weeks ago, I asked my secretary,

1166
01:11:06,030 --> 01:11:09,510
索尼娅・班森小姐求了婚
Miss Sonia Benson, to be my wife.

1167
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:13,870
我诧异的发现...她接受了!
I was astonished to find that... she accepted!

1168
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:16,740
两天前 她还在担心
Two days ago, worried perhaps that

1169
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:19,030
她的新郎可能会倒下去...
her bridegroom might keel over...

1170
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:42,950
索尼娅说服了一位非常乐意的骑士
Sonia persuaded a very willing knight of the realm

1171
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,470
陪她去了登记处 我们在那里结婚了
to accompany her to a registry office, where we were married.

1172
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,870
那么 举起你们的酒杯...
So, raise your glasses...

1173
01:11:51,870 --> 01:11:54,910
举起你们的酒杯吧  女士们先生们
raise your glasses, ladies and gentlemen.

1174
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:59,150
为了索尼娅・霍斯菲尔德女士干杯
The toast is Lady Sonia Horsfield.

1175
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:02,870
为了索尼娅・霍斯菲尔德女士
To Lady Sonia Horsfield.

1176
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:07,110
你高兴吗 索尼娅? 你现在高兴了吗 嗯?
Are you happy, Sonia? Happy now, are you?

1177
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:08,270
十分高兴
Very happy.

1178
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:13,230
你呢? 你让我成为这世上最幸福的男人
Are you? Because you've made me the happiest man in the world.

1179
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:51,590
该死...我们太迟了
Sacrè... We are too late.

1180
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:55,550
雷斯塔里克先生 请先让我处理这件事
Monsieur Restarick, please, allow me to deal with this immediately.

1181
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:07,270
我们怎么会没预见到这种事?
How could we not see this coming?

1182
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:10,230
请你节哀 罗德里克先生
I am so sorry for your loss, Sir Roderick.

1183
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:14,550
这真是最大的悲剧
This is indeed a tragedy most terrible.

1184
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:17,790
我还是不敢相信
I still can't believe it.

1185
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:20,070
当然 除了一个人
Except, of course, for one person.

1186
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:21,680
我说的是那个期盼
And I refer to the person who had hoped for

1187
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:24,230
甚至是推动这次惨案发生的人
and encouraged this tragedy for a long time.

1188
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,510
是谁想诺尔玛死?
Who could possibly wish Norma dead?

1189
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:29,830
啊 是谁呢 嗯?
Ah. Who indeed, huh?

1190
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,070
也许就是你自己 索尼娅女士
Perhaps you yourself, Lady Sonia.

1191
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,990
从她母亲的遗产方面来说
In the terms of the legacy of her mother,

1192
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:41,270
你的新丈夫能继承诺尔玛小姐一半的财产
your new husband inherits half a portion of the fortune of Mademoiselle Norma.

1193
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:43,150
也许是克劳迪娅小姐
Or perhaps Mademoiselle Claudia,

1194
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:46,350
你对她的蔑视相当明显
who despised her in a manner that was so obvious,

1195
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,550
而且也可能和她的父亲结婚
and who had the hope of marrying her father,

1196
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:51,990
他也能从他亡妻那里继承一半的财产
who also inherits a half share of the fortune of his late wife.

1197
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:54,150
或者是弗朗西丝・凯瑞小姐?
Or Mademoiselle Frances Cary?

1198
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:55,950
她疯狂的迷恋上了那个
Who had become so infatuated with the young man

1199
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,600
深深爱着诺尔玛・雷斯塔里克小姐的帅哥
who was so loved by Mademoiselle Norma Restarick,

1200
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,190
大卫・贝克先生...
Monsieur David Baker...

1201
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:04,990
而他爱上她的原因好像是他发现她很有钱
whose love for her seemed to increase the more he discovered how wealthy she was.

1202
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:07,980
为了能够找到这个问题的答案
But in order to answer this question,

1203
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:10,470
我们需要再问一个问题
it is necessary to ask another.

1204
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:13,030
先让我们回到最开始
So let us go back to the very beginning.

1205
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:16,070
谁希望施格兰姆保姆死?
Who wished to kill Nanny Seagram?

1206
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:19,470
哦 求你了! 现在的时机和地点都不对!
Oh, please! This is not the time or place!

1207
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:22,390
诺尔玛已经认罪了
Norma confessed to that.

1208
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:24,430
我想这就是她为什么...
I think that's why she...

1209
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:28,500
再说 这能有什么帮助呢?
And what is all this in aid of?

1210
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:31,470
先生 我希望你能先让波罗先生说完
Sir, I'd ask you to allow Monsieur Poirot to speak.

1211
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:34,590
谢谢 纳尔森警长
Merci, Inspector Nelson.

1212
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:37,790
当诺尔玛・雷斯塔里克小姐来找我时
When Mademoiselle Norma Restarick rendered to me the visit,

1213
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:42,070
她说她好像杀了人 她求我...求我救她
she said that she might have committed a murder, and asked me to... save her.

1214
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:48,230
我觉得这不可能是杀人犯说的话
I would suggest that those are the words not of a murderer

1215
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:50,070
而是受害者说的话
but of a victim.

1216
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:52,590
施格兰姆保姆是被谋杀的?
Was Nanny Seagram murdered?

1217
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:57,580
还是像警察简单认为的那样...
Or was it, as the police seemed to assume, too easily...

1218
01:14:58,600 --> 01:14:59,910
...是自杀?
...the suicide?

1219
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:02,910
我不确定
I could not be sure of the answer.

1220
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,710
但是在照片后面的字...
But an inscription on the back of a photograph...

1221
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:10,750
"十字树篱庄园 长基 1917年
"Crosshedges, Long Basing, 1917.

1222
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,790
最后一个快乐的夏天
The last happy summer.

1223
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:14,670
A J 巴特斯比"
A J Battersby. "

1224
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:17,100
...这让我把这次的死亡
...caused me to suspect that the death

1225
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:19,420
与诺尔玛・雷斯塔里克小姐和施格兰姆保姆
was somehow connected with some trauma

1226
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:22,990
身上的外伤联系在一起
in the lives of Mademoiselle Norma Restarick and the Nanny Seagram.

1227
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:25,710
所以 我去了一趟十字树篱庄园
So, I made a visit to Crosshedges.

1228
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:29,430
此行为我的调查带来了重要的发现
And I learned there something crucial to my investigation.

1229
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:32,590
我在那里碰到了大卫・贝克先生
I made the acquaintance there of Monsieur David Baker.

1230
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,390
为什么他在那?
Why was he there?

1231
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:38,140
据罗德里克先生说 他是想要这家人的照片
Well, according to Sir Roderick, he wanted some photographs of the family

1232
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,190
因为他打算画一幅
because he was about to execute a portrait

1233
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:41,630
安德鲁・雷斯塔里克先生
of Monsieur Andrew Restarick

1234
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:43,030
年轻时候的画像 是吗?
 as a young man. Oui?

1235
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:46,910
他很冷淡地对我说了句让我起疑的话
A man of whom he spoke to me with great cynicism and said, most revealingly...

1236
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,470
我从没见过他
I've never met him.

1237
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:51,990
这话真奇怪啊 你说是吗 先生?
That's a thing most strange to say, n'est-ce pas, monsieur?

1238
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:55,270
我扯远了 让我们回到施格兰姆保姆
I digress. Let us return to Nanny Seagram,

1239
01:15:56,200 --> 01:16:00,270
一个上了年纪又有酒瘾的女人
a woman who was old, who was vulnerable, who had a problem with drink,

1240
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:01,990
据看门人说
which, according to the concierge,

1241
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:05,610
自从安德鲁・雷斯塔里克先生从南非回来后
increased since the arrival

1242
01:16:05,610 --> 01:16:07,110
酗酒就更严重了
from South Africa of Monsieur Andrew Restarick.

1243
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:08,670
我想知道原因
I wondered why.

1244
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:14,350
她依靠雷斯塔里克公司的资助来维持生计
She was dependent on the good will of the company Restarick for the roof over her head.

1245
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:17,310
但她没必要担心
But she had no need to worry.

1246
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,470
你最有理由感谢她 对吗 先生?
For you had reason most sound to be grateful to her, had you not, monsieur?

1247
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:24,030
为她给这个家服侍了这么久 对的
For all her service to the family, yes.

1248
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:28,430
是 也为了她帮你冒充一个已死的人
Oui. And also for helping you to impersonate a man who was dead.

1249
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,950
一个已死的人?
A man who was dead?

1250
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,510
纳尔森警长昨天查到的消息证实了我的怀疑
The inquiries of Inspector Nelson confirmed my suspicions yesterday.

1251
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:39,870
今天 我收到南非来的电报
And today... I received a telegram from South Africa,

1252
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:43,900
证实了安德鲁・雷斯塔里克先生
confirming the death of Monsieur Andrew Restarick

1253
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:45,390
一年前已经去世
it is now since one year.

1254
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:50,380
先生 今天诺尔玛・雷斯塔里克小姐问你的
So, monsieur, as Mademoiselle Norma Restarick demanded of you today,

1255
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:52,270
我 赫尔克里・波罗 也想问你
I, Hercule Poirot, also demand of you.

1256
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:55,430
你是谁?
Who are you?

1257
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:58,590
我叫罗伯特・奥威尔
My name... is Robert Orwell.

1258
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,390
安德鲁・雷斯塔里克生前是我的好友
Andrew Restarick was my good friend.

1259
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:05,630
死后亦是我的好友
None of this was ever meant to end in death.

1260
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:08,960
你... 你是个骗子? 
You... You are an impostor?

1261
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,910
不 罗迪 不 坐下
No, Roddy, no. Sit down.

1262
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:13,750
真正的安德鲁・雷斯塔里克
The real Andrew Restarick has not been seen

1263
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:16,080
20年来从未来过英国
in England for 20 years.

1264
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:18,500
被他抛弃的妻子
His wife, whom he abandoned...

1265
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:22,470
毁掉了一切关于他相貌的物件
...had destroyed every image of him she possessed,

1266
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:24,030
算是被她亲手杀死了
and was now dead by her own hand.

1267
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:26,460
罗德里克先生 啊 他失明了 
Sir Roderick, alas, had lost his sight,

1268
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:27,830
而他的女儿诺尔玛
 and his daughter, Mademoiselle Norma,

1269
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:31,230
五岁以后再也没有见过他
had not seen him since she was five years of age.

1270
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,150
只有一个人可以揭穿他的骗局
There was now only one person who could give away the game.

1271
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:38,550
施格兰姆保姆
Nanny Seagram.

1272
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:41,710
你威胁她 如果她敢揭穿你 你就会赶她走
Threatened with eviction if she attempted to expose you,

1273
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:45,880
而且还用无限量的杜松子酒来贿赂她
and bribed with a supply, seemingly without end, of gin,

1274
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:49,110
后来她同意了你的计划
she had fallen in with your plans.

1275
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:51,730
现在你可以自由地接管公司 
Now you were free to take over the business.

1276
01:17:51,730 --> 01:17:53,910
可以把它卖给最高出价人
 Now you would sell it to the highest bidder.

1277
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:58,430
- 你错了 波罗 - 恩?
- You're wrong, Poirot. - Hm?

1278
01:17:58,480 --> 01:17:59,870
这公司不值钱
The business was worthless.

1279
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:02,910
但你离开南非之前并不知道
But you could not have known this before you left South Africa.

1280
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,590
还能有什么原因让你来这儿?
Why else would you come here?

1281
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:07,230
- 我没有杀害任何人 - 但你有动机杀人
- I never murdered anyone. - But you had the motive.

1282
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,740
你害怕施格兰姆保姆会去揭穿你
Fearing that Nanny Seagram was about to expose you,

1283
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:12,070
所以有必要让她永远沉默
is was necessary perhaps to silence her.

1284
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:15,350
但当诺尔玛・雷斯塔里克认罪时
Ah, but when Mademoiselle Norma Restarick confessed to the murder,

1285
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,500
你突然就意识到
you suddenly realised that,

1286
01:18:16,510 --> 01:18:18,660
作为安德鲁・雷斯塔里克先生
ah, as Sir Andrew Restarick,

1287
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:20,150
你就是最近的血亲
you were next of kin.

1288
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:23,230
你可以继承她母亲一半的财产
You would now inherit half the legacy of her mother.

1289
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:26,790
所以你袖手旁观没有阻止她
So you stood by in silence and let her.

1290
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:32,150
现在你离大富豪只有一步之遥
You were now within inches of becoming the millionaire.

1291
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:38,260
甚至也可以说你是刽子手的刀
One might even say the length of the rope of... the hangman.

1292
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:43,080
但现在 这些财产不会属于你了 先生
But now, this fortune will not go to you, monsieur,

1293
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:44,910
不会属于一个被揭穿的骗子
an impostor who has been revealed,

1294
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:46,390
钱会给罗德里克先生
but to Sir Roderick.

1295
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:48,000
我的丈夫并不在乎那些
My husband doesn't care about that.

1296
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,710
他只想诺尔玛能活过来
He just wants Norma back.

1297
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,750
你这禽兽! 你怎么下得了手?
You monster! How can you do this?

1298
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,630
等一等 警长
One second, Inspector.

1299
01:18:55,520 --> 01:19:00,270
最近有些新消息引起了我的注意
There has recently come to my attention some information that is new.

1300
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:04,080
在座还有另一个人
There is one other person here

1301
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:07,660
有权继承诺尔玛小姐的财产
who has the claim to the fortune of Mademoiselle Norma Restarick.

1302
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:10,990
我在施格兰姆保姆的公寓发现的照片
The photograph that I discovered in the apartment of Nanny Seagram

1303
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:14,150
被诺尔玛・雷斯塔里克小姐的前家庭教师
was taken by the former tutor of Mademoiselle Norma Restarick -

1304
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:17,590
一位叫A J 巴特斯比的女士拿走了
a Mademoiselle A J Battersby.

1305
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:20,790
我去拜访了现在由她担任校长的学校
I paid a visit to her school where she is now the principal.

1306
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:25,390
我发现了有一位女士谈及被抛弃的孩子
And I found there a woman full of emotion about a child who had been abandoned,

1307
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:28,900
和一位遗弃母女俩的父亲时很激动
and a man who had deserted them both.

1308
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:31,550
她一直坚信他会回来
She never gave up hope that he would return.

1309
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,470
或者会有一封让她去父亲那里的信
Or that a letter would arrive asking her to go out and join him.

1310
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:38,590
但都没有
It never did.

1311
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:42,310
并且 这位女士用错误的时间误导了我
And a woman, moreover, who misled me about dates.

1312
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:45,340
她说她辞去了诺尔玛・雷斯塔里克的
She told to me that

1313
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:46,830
家庭教师的工作后
 she had moved straight from her employment

1314
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:51,110
立刻开始建立了自己的学校
as the tutor to Mademoiselle Norma Restarick into setting up her own establishment.

1315
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:53,530
但是那时诺尔玛小姐才5岁
But that was when Mademoiselle Norma was five years of age,

1316
01:19:53,530 --> 01:19:55,710
现在已经过了20年了
and that is now since 20 years.

1317
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:59,190
但是曼顿菲尔德学校只有十八年的历史
But Meadowfield School, it was only established it is now since 18 years.

1318
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:01,310
那么这两年间她在做什么呢?
So what did she do in the two years in between?

1319
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:04,470
为什么她这么短的时间就离职了呢?
And why had she left her employment after so brief a time?

1320
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:06,250
现在 罗德里克先生
Now, I would like to ask you, Sir Roderick,

1321
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:08,550
我想让你来证实我的怀疑
to confirm my suspicions.

1322
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,320
为什么巴特斯比女士
The reason why Mademoiselle Battersby

1323
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:13,190
这么突然地离开十字树篱庄园呢?
left Crosshedges so abruptly

1324
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:16,340
因为她爱上了安德鲁・雷斯塔里克
was because she had fallen in love with Andrew Restarick

1325
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:17,990
还怀了他的孩子
 and conceived by him a child.

1326
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,470
对吗?
Am I correct?

1327
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,710
是的 波罗 你说的没错
Yes, Poirot, you are correct.

1328
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:27,910
她突然离开 消失了两年
She left suddenly. Disappeared for two years.

1329
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,100
这样啊
C'est sa.

1330
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:31,150
她悄悄离开了
So she went away secretly.

1331
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:33,710
生下了孩子 一个女孩
Bore the child. A girl.

1332
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:36,670
诺尔玛・雷斯塔里克小姐同父异母的妹妹
The half-sister to Mademoiselle Norma Restarick.

1333
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:39,390
是这样吗 凯瑞小姐?
Is that not so, Mademoiselle Cary?

1334
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:45,430
或许我应该叫你...巴特斯比小姐?
Or should I call you... Mademoiselle Battersby?

1335
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:53,270
我从小一直梦想有一天能找到我的姐姐
I grew up dreaming that one day I'd find my sister.

1336
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:57,430
当我找到她时...简直就像是奇迹
When I found her... it was like a miracle.

1337
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:00,310
我知道克劳迪娅在这个家族企业工作
I knew Claudia worked for the family firm,

1338
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:03,430
我简直不敢相信诺尔玛也搬进来了
and I couldn't believe my luck when Norma moved in too.

1339
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:06,110
我很想告诉她 她有一个妹妹
I longed to tell her she had a sister.

1340
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:10,230
- 但她现在没机会知道了 - 嗯
- And now she'll never know. - Non.

1341
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:15,030
讽刺的是 诺尔玛小姐死后
And the irony, with Mademoiselle Norma... gone...

1342
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:19,110
你却有权继承她的财产
...you have a claim that is legal to her fortune after all.

1343
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:21,070
是吗?
Does she?

1344
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:27,800
但一切都无法让诺尔玛复活了 对吗? 
But nothing can bring Norma back, can it?

1345
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:28,360
嗯
Non.

1346
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:31,070
一切都无法让诺尔玛小姐复活了
Nothing can bring back Mademoiselle Norma.

1347
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,310
警员!
Constable!

1348
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:53,550
诺尔玛!
Norma!

1349
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:55,870
但你已经死了啊
But you're dead.

1350
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:00,250
我看见你死了 
I saw you dead.

1351
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:02,030
你看见的是你想看见的
You saw what you wanted to see.

1352
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,550
女士们先生们
Messieurs-dames,

1353
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:12,150
波罗为你们揭秘真相的时刻到了
it is now the time for Poirot to unveil to you the truth.

1354
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:17,750
在今晚雷斯塔里克小姐去浴室时
When Mademoiselle Restarick drew her bath this evening,

1355
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:21,270
凯瑞小姐发现重现
Mademoiselle Cary saw this as the opportunity irresistible

1356
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:24,910
她母亲自杀情形的机会来了
of replicating the circumstances of the suicide of her mother.

1357
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:28,390
但我早已预见了这事并做了预防措施
But knowing this was going to happen, I took a precaution.

1358
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:33,830
大卫・贝克先生发现你拿着枕头走进了浴室
<i>You were observed by Monsieur David Baker entering the bathroom with a pillow.

1359
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:35,150
为什么?
Why?

1360
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,990
为了闷死她
In order to smother her.

1361
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:42,990
太可笑了!
This is risible!

1362
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:44,990
为什么我要这么对我姐姐呢?
Why would I ever do such a thing to my sister?

1363
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:48,030
还有什么报复方法能比从抛弃你的父亲手中 
What revenge more sweet could you have on a man who abandoned you

1364
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:51,830
把婚生的姐姐的继承权夺来更好吗?
than to steal the inheritance of his daughter who was legitimate?

1365
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:55,630
你同父异母的姐姐享有的财产
The inheritance of your half-sister that was so privileged,

1366
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:57,310
被你继承了 真可恨
and by you, so hated!

1367
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:02,100
当你母亲知道雷斯塔里克先生回英国后
When your mother learned that Monsieur Restarick had returned to this country,

1368
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:03,630
她去找过他
she went to confront him.

1369
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:05,390
但她发现那是个冒牌货 
But she found there instead the impostor,

1370
01:23:05,390 --> 01:23:07,110
是罗伯特・奥威尔先生
 Monsieur Robert Orwell.

1371
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:10,230
最遗憾的是 她把这件事告诉了你
And, most regrettably, she shared this information with you.

1372
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:14,630
而这正是你期盼已久的机会
And recognising this as the opportunity for which you had wished so long...

1373
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:19,390
你 弗朗西丝・凯瑞小姐 瞒着你母亲
...you, Mademoiselle Frances Cary, unbeknown to your mother,

1374
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:22,510
找到了这个冒牌货奥威尔先生
confronted the impostor, Monsieur Orwell,

1375
01:23:22,510 --> 01:23:25,590
坚决让他加入你可怕的计划
 and insisted that he join in your plan so terrible.

1376
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:27,510
你希望能以"自杀"的方式溺死她
You wished to steal

1377
01:23:27,510 --> 01:23:28,390
或者让她发疯
the inheritance of Mademoiselle Norma

1378
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:31,470
以此来夺得她的遗产
by driving her to suicide or insanity.

1379
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:34,350
为了让计划实现
And in order to achieve this end...

1380
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:37,230
你让奥威尔先生把她安顿在
...you had Monsieur Orwell install her

1381
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:40,710
施格兰姆保姆住的公寓里
in the building of apartments that also housed Nanny Seagram -

1382
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:44,630
这个女人死在她眼前
a woman whose very presence would remind her of the guilt she felt

1383
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:46,790
会让她想起母亲自杀给她带来的内疚
over the suicide of her mother.

1384
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:51,750
你计算好了这将给她敏感的回忆带来的影响
You calculated the effect that this would have on a mind so fragile,

1385
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:55,990
而你 作为心怀美梦的演员 你当然会扮演
and you, as the actress with aspirations, of course you would play the part

1386
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:59,310
讨人喜欢的支持朋友的角色 对吗?
of the friend so loving and so supportive, huh?

1387
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:03,070
可怜的诺尔玛・雷斯塔里克小姐
Pauvre Mademoiselle Norma Restarick,

1388
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,110
现在如此的脆弱
who was now so frail,

1389
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:07,390
变成了你的猎物
had become your prey.

1390
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:10,390
你! 当然 你一直在那儿陪她
You! Of course, you were always there for her...

1391
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:13,630
诺尔玛 你要让我进来陪陪你吗?
Norma, would you like me to come and sit with you?

1392
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:15,830
挑起那些痛苦的回忆!
...provoking memories that were painful!

1393
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:18,550
谁要吃冰淇淋?
 Who would like ice cream?

1394
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:22,670
你甚至计划夺走想给她真爱和希望的
You even planned to steal away the young man who tried to give to her existence

1395
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:25,280
年轻小伙子
real love and hope.

1396
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:28,170
但这次挑战
But this campaign

1397
01:24:28,170 --> 01:24:30,790
诺尔玛・雷斯塔里克小姐心理的行动
against the psyche of Mademoiselle Norma Restarick

1398
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:35,590
在谋杀施格兰姆保姆的事件上达到了高潮
reached its climax so inglorious in the murder of Nanny Seagram.

1399
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:38,910
诺尔玛・雷斯塔里克如你所愿地
It was no accident that

1400
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:40,790
想起了她的母亲!
Mademoiselle Norma Restarick felt responsible for her mother!

1401
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:44,310
这是你精心安排算计的!
You orchestrated this conviction with precision!

1402
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:45,990
你的计划
Your plan...

1403
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:51,670
主要靠两把...一模一样的刀
...depended on two knives that were... identical.

1404
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:55,790
第一把 你放在她肯定能看到的房间的某处
The first knife, you left in her room where you knew she would look.

1405
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:00,520
然后 派对之前 
And then, before the party,

1406
01:25:00,530 --> 01:25:02,940
雷斯塔里克小姐去找施格兰姆保姆前
 before Mademoiselle Restarick could reach her,

1407
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:07,870
你残忍地杀害了无助的施格兰姆保姆
you sealed the fate so brutally... of Nanny Seagram, who was helpless.

1408
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:13,990
然后在那里留下了第二把刀
And left behind there the second knife.

1409
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:22,470
你一知道诺尔玛・雷斯塔里克发现了尸体
Once you had learned that Mademoiselle Norma Restarick had discovered the body,

1410
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:27,030
就立刻藏起了诺尔玛小姐留在抽屉的第一把刀
simply you had to remove the first knife, that Mademoiselle Norma had left in her drawer.

1411
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:31,270
而现在 她的记忆彻底混乱了
And now, with her mind in a state of total confusion,

1412
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:35,590
诺尔玛・雷斯塔里克小姐坚信自己犯下了罪行
Mademoiselle Norma Restarick was fully convinced that she had committed the act.

1413
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:39,630
也许现在她就打算要自杀了
And she was headed now perhaps towards the suicide.

1414
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:44,510
但当她认罪时 结果也是一样
But when she confessed to the murder, the result would be the same.

1415
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:45,870
她会被处死
She would hang.

1416
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:50,430
当她今早从监狱里释放时 你别无选择了
And when she was released from prison this morning, there was only one option open to you.

1417
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:54,390
只有加快她的死期 但我 
To hurry along her death. But I,

1418
01:25:54,390 --> 01:25:57,240
赫尔克里・波罗 答应过要救她!
Hercule Poirot, had promised to himself to save her!

1419
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:02,750
对此我唯一能做的
And the only way I could do this...

1420
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,790
就是在你之前...杀死她
...was to kill her before you could.

1421
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,950
- 我根本没参与这些 波罗 - 骗子!
- I had no part in this, Poirot. - Liar!

1422
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,870
在杀害施格兰姆保姆一案中 先生 你没参与
In the murder of Nanny Seagram, monsieur, non,

1423
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:23,430
因为你有那晚不在场证明
for, en effet, you had provided for yourself an alibi that night.

1424
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:28,190
但我想知道为什么有人会在谋杀当晚
But I did wonder why someone wanted to be somewhere else, in a manner so obvious,

1425
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:30,110
特地出现在别处
on the night of the murder.

1426
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:33,940
你在这里的那晚 你知道会发生什么?
That night you were here, you knew what was going to happen?

1427
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,110
当然 怎么知道的?
Naturellement. How?

1428
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:37,870
因为杀人犯是他的同谋
Because the killer was his accomplice,

1429
01:26:37,870 --> 01:26:39,750
弗朗西丝・凯瑞小姐!
Mademoiselle Frances Cary!

1430
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:45,750
打断一下
Excuse me a moment.

1431
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:49,790
你能解释下为什么他们中的一个要袭击我吗?
Can you explain why one of them decided it was necessary to attack me?

1432
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:54,070
好吧 夫人
Ah, well... madame,

1433
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:58,150
这都是因为施格兰姆保姆写的那封信
all this hinges on a letter that was written by Nanny Seagram.

1434
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:06,340
她可以容忍奥威尔先生伪装成雷斯塔里克先生
She could endure the pretence that Monsieur Orwell was Monsieur Restarick,

1435
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:10,710
却她发现这场邪恶的计划慢慢偏离了计划
but the sheer wickedness of this new conspiracy proved too much for her.

1436
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:13,910
于是 她写了一封信给你 对吗 先生?
So, she wrote to you a letter, did she not, monsieur,

1437
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:16,520
威胁说如果你不停止的话就要告发你 
threatening to denounce you if you did not desist?

1438
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:20,750
此外 为了保护自己不被你报复
And, in order to protect herself from your retribution,

1439
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:23,900
她藏了一份那封信的复印件
she hid a copy of that letter to be read

1440
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:25,470
以防她有任何意外
in the event of her death.

1441
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:28,310
她告诉你 她已经这么做了
And told to you that she had done so.

1442
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:31,330
所以现在 在你眼里 凯瑞小姐
So now, in your eyes, Mademoiselle Cary,

1443
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:33,070
施格兰姆保姆必须得死
Nanny Seagram had to die.

1444
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,990
必须拿回那封信
And that letter had to be retrieved.

1445
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:38,390
但奥利弗夫人先你一步到那
But Madame Oliver had got there first.

1446
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:41,750
奥威尔先生和克劳迪娅小姐不会看到
It could not have been Monsieur Orwell or Mademoiselle Claudia

1447
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:44,020
看到奥利弗夫人拿到那封信
who had observed Madame Oliver retrieve that letter,

1448
01:27:44,020 --> 01:27:45,870
因为他们和我在一起
for they were with me.

1449
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:49,950
不 小姐 是你看到了她
No, Mademoiselle, it was you yourself who observed her

1450
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,110
然后打电话告诉奥威尔先生这事
and called Monsieur Orwell to inform him of this fact.

1451
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:56,990
当达芙妮女士从甜叶草茶屋
And when Mademoiselle Daphne from The Merry Shamrock tearooms

1452
01:27:57,040 --> 01:28:00,270
打电话给我告诉我奥利弗夫人的行踪时
telephoned to me to inform me of the whereabouts of Madame Oliver,

1453
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:02,310
你在偷听
you were listening in.

1454
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:04,670
我说的没错吧?
Ah, oui, bien s?r.

1455
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:08,870
我挂电话前几秒听到你把听筒放下了
I heard the click as you replaced the telephone receiver a second or two before I did.

1456
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:13,700
你很清楚的知道奥利弗夫人在哪儿
And now you knew exactly where was Madame Oliver.

1457
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:21,710
现在那封信再也不会到警方手中
And now the letter could not longer get into the hands of the police.

1458
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,790
现在你的同伙很安全
Now the conspirators were safe.

1459
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:27,750
因此克劳迪娅小姐向警察告发了
Whereupon Mademoiselle Claudia denounced to the police

1460
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:31,230
可怜的诺尔玛・雷斯塔里克小姐
la pauvre Mademoiselle Norma Restarick.

1461
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:35,590
他带我去吃饭逼我这样做的
He took me to dinner and asked me to do it.

1462
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:40,670
他说他无法自己告发自己的亲骨肉
He said he couldn't bring himself to denounce his own flesh and blood.

1463
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:42,650
天呐 诺尔玛 对不起 
Oh, God, Norma, I'm so sorry.

1464
01:28:42,650 --> 01:28:43,990
都是他的主意!
It was all his idea!

1465
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:45,790
难道你还不懂吗?
Can't you see that?

1466
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:48,630
你演技真拙劣 弗朗西丝 而我也是个笨蛋
You're a terrible actress, Frances. And I'm a fool.

1467
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:52,790
我警告过你 你的仇恨会坏事 但你就是不听
I warned you that your hatred would get in the way, but you wouldn't listen.

1468
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:55,550
小姐
Miss.

1469
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:02,910
弗朗西丝!
Frances!

1470
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:05,750
我们是亲姐妹
We're half-sisters.

1471
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:09,320
看 大卫在罗迪舅父的盒子里发现的
Look, David found it in Uncle Roddy's box.

1472
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,790
那是我们的父亲
It's our father.

1473
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:14,950
我看不到有像的地方
I see no resemblance.

1474
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:20,830
我父亲怎么了?
What happened to my father?

1475
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:23,470
我们出城时 发生了一场意外
An accident, while we were up country together.

1476
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:27,710
他是个好伙计 我一直很喜欢他
He was a good chap. I always liked Andrew.

1477
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:30,930
你对这差点被你毁了的可怜人
Have you nothing to say to this poor creature

1478
01:29:30,930 --> 01:29:32,430
没什么要说的了吗?
you tried to destroy?

1479
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:35,990
虽然你的心这么黑...
Is there not one impulse that is honest...

1480
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:40,110
你就没有一点诚实吗?
...human, even, in your heart so black?

1481
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:42,150
你想让我说什么?
What would you have me say?

1482
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:46,790
我父亲提到过我吗?
Did... Did my father ever speak of me?

1483
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:50,550
好吧 波罗先生想要诚实
Well, Monsieur Poirot wants honesty...

1484
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:53,510
所以我就实话实说了
...so I'll be honest.

1485
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:56,820
我只听安德鲁提过一次
I only ever heard Andrew mention you once.

1486
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:02,670
他说你就是那个要继承他妻子财产的小贱人
He said you were the little bitch who'd get all his wife's money.

1487
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:05,990
我知道安德鲁已经够坏了
I knew Andrew was rotten,

1488
01:30:05,990 --> 01:30:09,070
但你! 你的坏已经无法言表了!
 but you! You beggar description!

1489
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:36,070
诺尔玛?
Norma?

1490
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:53,020
这么说索尼娅不是靠色相骗钱财的女人 
So, Sonia wasn't a gold-digger after all.

1491
01:30:53,020 --> 01:30:53,990
不是
No.

1492
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:56,270
孔雀也不是
Nor was the peacock.

1493
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:58,310
你怎么知道?
How did you know?

1494
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:01,470
因为你告诉过我 夫人
Because you told that to me yourself, madame.

1495
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:04,070
你告诉我说 你看到他对她笑
You told me that you saw him smile at her,

1496
01:31:04,070 --> 01:31:06,030
他的目光无法离开她
that he could not take his eyes from hers.

1497
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:09,670
当我意识到他在找家人的照片
And the moment I realised that he was looking for photographs of the family

1498
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:11,600
来证明奥威尔先生是冒牌货的时候
to prove Monsieur Orwell an impostor,

1499
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:12,350
我就知道了
it was then I knew

1500
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:16,310
他是为了诺尔玛小姐好 而不是害她
that he was acting for Mademoiselle Norma and not against her.

1501
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:21,070
- 你确实想了很多事 不是吗? - 啊
- You do think of things, don't you? - Ah.

1502
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:23,490
真是精于算计 弯弯肠子 
What a calculating mind. Tortuous,

1503
01:31:23,490 --> 01:31:25,470
我会这么说 弯弯肠子
that's what I call it. Tortuous.

1504
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:27,510
我精于算计吗 夫人?
Am I so calculating, madame?

1505
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:31,950
我是个冷血的解谜者吗?
Am I the solver of puzzles with a heart that is cold?

1506
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:37,270
还是我们在看着生活中最大的谜团?
Or are we looking at the greatest of mysteries that life ever throws out?

1507
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:42,910
即使是我赫尔克里・波罗 也无法解释的谜团
The mystery that even I, Hercule Poirot, will never be able to solve.

1508
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:48,110
爱的本质
The nature of love.

1509
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:01,550
她笑了
She smiles.

1510
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:14,200
那是眼泪吗? 
Is that a tear?

1511
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:15,910
哦 不 不 不 夫人
Oh, no, no, no, madame.

1512
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:17,950
那是风吹的
It is merely the breeze.

1513
