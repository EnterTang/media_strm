<i>(Castle) "As he saw</i>

<i>"he rose up for a better view,</i>

11

12
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:03,328
Ooh.
Wow.

13
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,531
I know, right?
Oh, and listen to this.

14
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,233
"To my mentor, Richard Castle,

15
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,607
"without whose support and guidance

16
00:01:10,727 --> 00:01:13,386
"this book never would
have seen the light of day."

17
00:01:13,966 --> 00:01:16,201
All you did was give Alex Conrad

18
00:01:16,235 --> 00:01:19,671
a few notes on his manuscript
then send it to your publisher.

19
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:21,964
He was the one
who wrote the book.

20
00:01:22,084 --> 00:01:24,626
Mm. That's your version.
In my version... (Sighs)

21
00:01:24,634 --> 00:01:27,345
I gently fostered
the glowing embers of talent,

22
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,549
fanning them
into a literary wildfire.

23
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:32,189
He's gonna be in town

24
00:01:32,309 --> 00:01:33,761
and asked
to get together with me.

25
00:01:34,089 --> 00:01:36,306
He wants to learn more
about my writing process.

26
00:01:36,426 --> 00:01:39,528
And by "process," you mean
your procrastination

27
00:01:39,648 --> 00:01:43,228
until the very last second...
And then writing out of a desperate panic

28
00:01:43,262 --> 00:01:45,647
in a caffeine-induced haze?
That one?

29
00:01:45,767 --> 00:01:47,378
No, not that one.
(Laughs)

30
00:01:47,652 --> 00:01:50,335
The one where I find authenticity

31
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:53,738
by doing hands-on research
with the NYPD.

32
00:01:53,773 --> 00:01:56,802
Ah. So I'm having Alex meet me
at the precinct later on today.

33
00:01:56,922 --> 00:02:00,579
Beckett will be thrilled with that.
Beckett? I'm sure she won't mind.

34
00:02:00,613 --> 00:02:01,850
You haven't told her yet?

35
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,365
I am <i>sure</i> she will be fine
with it.

36
00:02:04,485 --> 00:02:07,352
Fine with it? Why would I
be fine with it?

37
00:02:07,386 --> 00:02:08,820
Okay. I'm sorry.

38
00:02:08,854 --> 00:02:11,389
Come on. He's a writer.

39
00:02:11,424 --> 00:02:14,726
How much trouble
could he possibly be?

40
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,262
So is that a yes?

41
00:02:17,296 --> 00:02:19,864
Is... is that a no?

42
00:02:19,899 --> 00:02:21,566
(Beckett) Hey, Lanie.
Hey.

43
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:23,435
Who's this?
Zack Lindsey,

44
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:25,870
a stand-out on the U.N.Y. swim team.

45
00:02:25,905 --> 00:02:28,897
Or he was before he drowned.
How does a champion swimmer drown?

46
00:02:29,017 --> 00:02:30,947
He had help.
Burns?

47
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,253
From a caustic substance.

48
00:02:32,373 --> 00:02:34,768
Someone put a rag to his face
soaked in the stuff.

49
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,004
He passed out from the fumes,

50
00:02:36,124 --> 00:02:38,245
then was dumped in the pool
to drown.

51
00:02:38,365 --> 00:02:42,621
Based on water and body temp,
I'd say between 1:00 and 5:00 this morning.

52
00:02:42,655 --> 00:02:45,246
And what was the substance?
I won't know till I get him back to the shop.

53
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:48,082
Who found him?
Zack's teammates when they showed up

54
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:50,720
for 6:00 A.M. swim practice.
All right. Let's talk to his teammates.

55
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,165
Find out if anyone had it in
for Zack, and let's figure out

56
00:02:53,285 --> 00:02:54,515
where they were
between 1:00 and 5:00 A.M.

57
00:02:54,635 --> 00:02:56,468
I'll go talk to Zack's coach.

58
00:02:56,502 --> 00:02:58,603
(Man)
It just doesn't seem real,

59
00:02:58,638 --> 00:03:01,692
seeing him lying there like that.
What was he doing here so late?

60
00:03:01,812 --> 00:03:03,375
Training.

61
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:05,377
Couldn't keep that kid
outta the pool.

62
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:06,878
Mm.
Two weeks ago,

63
00:03:06,912 --> 00:03:08,913
he got food poisoning
right before a meet.

64
00:03:08,948 --> 00:03:11,249
Sick as a dog,
just puking his guts out.

65
00:03:11,283 --> 00:03:14,052
I told him to withdraw,
but he toughed it out.

66
00:03:14,086 --> 00:03:15,587
Won all his events.

67
00:03:15,621 --> 00:03:17,155
But that was Zack.

68
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:19,724
He was gonna be
the next Rob Tredwyck

69
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,660
or Michael Phelps.

70
00:03:21,694 --> 00:03:23,595
Did he have
any personal problems?

71
00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:25,597
He was a kid from Bensonhurst,
you know?

72
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:28,099
I got him a partial scholarship,
but he lived on his own

73
00:03:28,134 --> 00:03:29,457
all the way out there because it's all
he could afford.

74
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:30,618
What about his parents?

75
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,504
Uh, his dad's gone.

76
00:03:32,538 --> 00:03:35,507
His, uh, mom had to move
to Atlantic City for work.

77
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,308
I...

78
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:38,643
(Police radio chatter)

79
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:40,779
Promised I was gonna
look out for him.

80
00:03:40,813 --> 00:03:42,113
(Radio chatter continues)

81
00:03:42,148 --> 00:03:43,615
What about the swim team?

82
00:03:43,649 --> 00:03:46,084
There must have been
some rivalries there.

83
00:03:46,118 --> 00:03:48,086
He and Brian Morris were
our two best chances

84
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,089
to win the tournament this week,
but there was no bad blood,

85
00:03:51,123 --> 00:03:54,092
not with Brian or anyone else on the team.
Okay I'm still gonna need a team roster

86
00:03:54,126 --> 00:03:58,329
and a list of all the people
who had access to this pool.

87
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,634
Uh... excuse me.

88
00:04:02,668 --> 00:04:04,936
Mm-hmm.

89
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,273
This is why Alexis
is never going to college.

90
00:04:08,307 --> 00:04:09,708
(Esposito) Hey.

91
00:04:09,742 --> 00:04:12,510
You want to hear something crazy?
Yeah.

92
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:14,512
I was talking
to the night janitor.

93
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:16,514
He was here
till 1:30 last night,

94
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:19,884
but he saw Zack with another guy.
Do we have a name?

95
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,887
We have a picture, too.
"Rocket" Rob Tredwyck.

96
00:04:22,922 --> 00:04:25,690
(Man with Australian accent)
Give us a big smile, mate.

97
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:27,492
(Camera shutter clicking)

98
00:04:27,526 --> 00:04:30,562
<i>♪</i>

99
00:04:30,596 --> 00:04:32,530
Yes, like that.

100
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:34,532
You love this man.
You want him.

101
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:38,036
That's funny.
I want him, too.

102
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,371
The guy was invincible in water.

103
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:42,373
I can't believe he'd drown.

104
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:45,176
How did you know him?
From a tournament, three years ago.

105
00:04:45,211 --> 00:04:47,679
Zack was a freshman
while I was headed to Beijing.

106
00:04:47,713 --> 00:04:49,914
(Chuckles)
I could tell he was special.

107
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:52,417
It was like looking
at a younger version of me.

108
00:04:52,451 --> 00:04:56,054
He was really that good?
Yeah, but, uh, that's not what I meant.

109
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:58,223
Most kids in this sport,
they come from money.

110
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:00,592
Zack and me,
we both grew up hard.

111
00:05:00,626 --> 00:05:01,958
So I took him under my wing.

112
00:05:02,078 --> 00:05:03,643
Sounds like you were kind
of a mentor to him.

113
00:05:03,763 --> 00:05:05,045
I was just looking out for my own.

114
00:05:05,165 --> 00:05:06,985
So what were you doing
at the pool last night?

115
00:05:07,105 --> 00:05:09,868
Zack said he wanted
to run drills, and I figured,

116
00:05:09,902 --> 00:05:11,536
what the hell?

117
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,272
Now that I'm retired, I don't
do enough time in the water.

118
00:05:14,306 --> 00:05:16,441
But I think he really just needed a friend.
Why is that?

119
00:05:16,475 --> 00:05:19,711
He just had the talk with his girl.
Where do babies come from?

120
00:05:19,745 --> 00:05:21,379
(Chuckles)
No, not that talk.

121
00:05:21,413 --> 00:05:23,715
The one I had with
my high school girlfriend

122
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:26,251
back in Wilmington.
(Camera shutter clicking)

123
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:28,586
If you want to get to the top,

124
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:30,522
you can't take everyone with you.

125
00:05:30,556 --> 00:05:32,891
So some people,
you have to leave behind

126
00:05:32,925 --> 00:05:35,393
so you have the talk.
And how did she handle that?

127
00:05:35,427 --> 00:05:39,197
She took it hard.
So did Zack.

128
00:05:39,231 --> 00:05:41,733
But he was worried about her,

129
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:44,302
worried that she might
do something stupid.

130
00:05:44,336 --> 00:05:46,069
Do you remember her name?

131
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:48,447
Bridget.
Bridget McManus.

132
00:05:48,567 --> 00:05:50,374
And what time did you
leave the pool last night?

133
00:05:50,494 --> 00:05:51,563
A little after midnight.

134
00:05:51,844 --> 00:05:53,745
Where were you
between 1:00 and 5:00 A.M.?

135
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:55,747
At Buddha Bar
with half the ad agency.

136
00:05:55,781 --> 00:05:57,982
We partied till dawn.
Mm-hmm.

137
00:05:58,017 --> 00:06:00,485
(Man) We're ready for you, Rocket.
Man... (Sighs)

138
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:03,521
Hell of a day to sell cologne.

139
00:06:05,357 --> 00:06:06,991
What were you looking at?

140
00:06:07,026 --> 00:06:09,627
(Camera shutter clicks)
Nothing.

141
00:06:32,852 --> 00:06:37,121
first day I put him in the pool,
he was 2 years old.

142
00:06:37,156 --> 00:06:40,124
Took to it like a fish.

143
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,960
You have kids?

144
00:06:41,994 --> 00:06:43,795
Two daughters and a son.

145
00:06:43,829 --> 00:06:47,098
It's what we do for them, right?

146
00:06:47,132 --> 00:06:49,300
When his dad left

147
00:06:49,335 --> 00:06:51,336
and I was feeling lower
than dirt,

148
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,371
you know what he told me?

149
00:06:53,405 --> 00:06:56,374
He said, "I'm gonna be someone
one day for you, ma,

150
00:06:56,408 --> 00:07:00,345
so you can walk
down the street and be proud."

151
00:07:02,181 --> 00:07:05,350
(Crying)
Who did this?

152
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:06,951
Who killed my son?

153
00:07:06,986 --> 00:07:10,088
We're doing everything we can
to find out.

154
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,359
Ms. Dinovi, what can you
tell me about Bridget McManus?

155
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:17,161
Her and Zack have been
an item since high school.

156
00:07:17,196 --> 00:07:19,163
What's this got to do
with Bridget?

157
00:07:19,198 --> 00:07:21,165
Maybe nothing, we're just
checking everywhere.

158
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,569
Did he mention anything else,
any trouble he might be in?

159
00:07:24,603 --> 00:07:27,739
Zack knew what trouble was.
He wanted no part of it.

160
00:07:27,773 --> 00:07:30,141
People don't get out
of our neighborhood.

161
00:07:32,711 --> 00:07:35,546
Zack was gonna make it.

162
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:39,884
My baby, he was going to make it.

163
00:07:39,952 --> 00:07:43,054
(Indistinct conversations)

164
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,023
(Beckett) Captain.

165
00:07:45,057 --> 00:07:46,524
Zack's mom.

166
00:07:46,558 --> 00:07:49,160
Anything about the girlfriend?
Not that she knows of.

167
00:07:49,194 --> 00:07:51,162
She seemed to think
everything was okay.

168
00:07:51,196 --> 00:07:53,231
Ah, then there was a lot
he wasn't sharing.

169
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:56,167
Check out the text messages
that Bridget fired off to Zack

170
00:07:56,201 --> 00:07:58,169
on the night he was killed.

171
00:07:58,203 --> 00:08:00,204
Ooh. Not a lot of "lols"
in there.

172
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:03,041
"Zack, if you leave me, I swear
to God, I'll kill you."

173
00:08:03,075 --> 00:08:05,743
She has a way with words.
And a record to go with it.

174
00:08:05,778 --> 00:08:07,245
Disorderly conduct.
Mostly minor stuff.

175
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,547
Uniforms are bringing her in now.
It says here she's 5'2".

176
00:08:09,581 --> 00:08:13,051
You really think she could overpower Zack?
Uh, no, but her brothers could.

177
00:08:13,085 --> 00:08:15,353
In grand Irish tradition,
she has four of them,

178
00:08:15,387 --> 00:08:17,889
each over 6 foot, each with
his own claim to fame...

179
00:08:17,923 --> 00:08:19,624
Assaults...
Oh.

180
00:08:19,658 --> 00:08:21,292
Ag. Assault...
Bad.

181
00:08:21,327 --> 00:08:23,294
A.D.W., battery...
Ee. Mm.

182
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:25,630
Assault on city employee, parking enforcement.
Doesn't count.

183
00:08:25,664 --> 00:08:27,532
Easy.
Dude.

184
00:08:27,566 --> 00:08:29,901
I... just jokes. All right, find
out where her brothers were

185
00:08:29,935 --> 00:08:31,636
between 1:00 and 5:00 A.M.

186
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,105
Castle and I will talk to Bridget.
Thank you, sir.

187
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,606
Kill him?

188
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:38,309
I've loved Zack Lindsey
since the ninth grade.

189
00:08:38,344 --> 00:08:40,745
You have a funny way
of showing it.

190
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:42,814
I was pissed.

191
00:08:42,848 --> 00:08:45,316
For five years, I cooked
his steamed chicken breast,

192
00:08:45,351 --> 00:08:47,585
I put his pasta in the tupperware

193
00:08:47,619 --> 00:08:50,588
at 4:00 in the morning,
I kept him company at the gym.

194
00:08:50,622 --> 00:08:52,957
And then he tells me,
"Sorry, Bridge.

195
00:08:52,992 --> 00:08:55,426
I can't have any other voices
in my head."

196
00:08:55,461 --> 00:08:57,462
Like suddenly, I'm a distraction.

197
00:08:57,496 --> 00:09:01,132
Like suddenly, I'm not good
enough for Colorado Springs?

198
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,167
So you threatened to kill him
unless he took you back?

199
00:09:03,202 --> 00:09:06,070
No, that's how I talk, okay?

200
00:09:06,105 --> 00:09:08,973
But there was something going on.

201
00:09:09,008 --> 00:09:11,809
And it had nothing to do
with swimming.

202
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:13,811
What do you mean?

203
00:09:13,846 --> 00:09:16,681
Lately, he had been stressed,
secretive.

204
00:09:16,715 --> 00:09:19,684
Add that to him saying,
"This is my time,"

205
00:09:19,718 --> 00:09:22,186
and the way those rich
college girls looked at him.

206
00:09:22,221 --> 00:09:25,123
I wasn't born yesterday.
I can do the math.

207
00:09:25,157 --> 00:09:27,425
You thought there was someone else.
Oh, yeah.

208
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:29,827
So I followed him out of
his apartment the other night,

209
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:32,296
ready to fight some queen bitch
from Connecticut

210
00:09:32,331 --> 00:09:35,666
for what's mine, only it wasn't another girl.
Well, who was it?

211
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:37,869
I don't know.
Some scary looking guy.

212
00:09:37,903 --> 00:09:39,337
They met under the el,

213
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:42,340
and they went at it,
yelling and screaming.

214
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:43,654
I couldn't tell about what,
though,

215
00:09:43,774 --> 00:09:44,994
'cause the guy had, like, an accent.

216
00:09:45,114 --> 00:09:47,973
What kind of accent...
Spanish, Asian, Russian?

217
00:09:48,093 --> 00:09:49,558
Do I look like I work
at the U.N.?

218
00:09:50,516 --> 00:09:52,784
Not Brooklyn, okay?

219
00:09:52,818 --> 00:09:55,019
Okay. No...

220
00:09:55,054 --> 00:09:57,155
Anyways, I asked Zack
about it afterwards,

221
00:09:57,189 --> 00:09:59,457
and he said it was nothing,
but it wasn't.

222
00:09:59,491 --> 00:10:03,828
Do you think you could describe
this guy to our sketch artist?

223
00:10:03,862 --> 00:10:06,230
(Telephone receiver clatters)

224
00:10:06,265 --> 00:10:08,399
So Lanie confirms
no drug in his system,

225
00:10:08,434 --> 00:10:10,435
performance-enhancing
or otherwise.

226
00:10:10,469 --> 00:10:13,037
And from the high levels
of chloride ion in his blood,

227
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:15,339
she is sure that the burns
came from chlorine.

228
00:10:15,374 --> 00:10:18,242
Hmm. So our
heavily accented killer

229
00:10:18,277 --> 00:10:20,845
rendered Zack unconscious
with a chlorine-soaked rag.

230
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:23,981
We don't know that he's a killer.
Is this the face of an innocent man?

231
00:10:24,016 --> 00:10:25,983
He had a heated argument
with our victim

232
00:10:26,018 --> 00:10:29,153
the night before he was killed.
And what would his motive be exactly?

233
00:10:29,188 --> 00:10:31,089
He... if...

234
00:10:31,123 --> 00:10:33,391
<i>I...</i> may have a line
on that.

235
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,608
I'm looking at Zack's financials.

236
00:10:35,728 --> 00:10:39,019
The guy only had a partial
scholarship. He still paid

237
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,267
for most of his tuition,
books, and living expenses,

238
00:10:41,387 --> 00:10:43,067
all without taking student loans.

239
00:10:43,102 --> 00:10:46,124
He didn't have a job, and his
mom was just squeaking by.

240
00:10:46,244 --> 00:10:48,534
<i>And</i> NCAA rules

241
00:10:48,654 --> 00:10:50,950
preclude him from receiving
any financial assistance

242
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,310
from outside his family.

243
00:10:52,344 --> 00:10:54,212
So where did he get that money?

244
00:10:55,305 --> 00:10:57,229
You think maybe he borrowed
money from the wrong guys

245
00:10:57,349 --> 00:10:59,884
to finance his dream?
And when he couldn't make the payments,

246
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:02,220
they came after him.
That would explain the argument.

247
00:11:02,254 --> 00:11:04,255
(Cell phone rings) Esposito.

248
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,892
We don't even know
that there was an argument,

249
00:11:06,012 --> 00:11:08,424
and the only evidence we have
is a sketch of a man

250
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:10,995
that Bridget claims she saw.
(Esposito) Start processing it.

251
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,564
All right, thanks.

252
00:11:13,263 --> 00:11:15,733
(Beep) Uniforms just
got to Zack's place.

253
00:11:15,768 --> 00:11:17,836
Looks like it's been tossed.

254
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,438
This place looks like
my first apartment.

255
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:22,440
We used to have cockroach races.

256
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:25,844
Wonder if that's how Kafka
got the idea.

257
00:11:25,878 --> 00:11:28,379
(Police radio chatter)

258
00:11:28,414 --> 00:11:31,015
Looks like Zack
didn't do his chores.

259
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,550
(Camera shutter clicks)

260
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:35,816
Zack was killed and then
his place gets trashed?

261
00:11:35,936 --> 00:11:38,289
Not a coincidence.
(Camera shutter clicking)

262
00:11:38,324 --> 00:11:41,960
You think maybe this was part
of a debt collection effort?

263
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:44,629
Well, then why'd they leave
the TV and the laptop?

264
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:47,131
Or the medical supplies.

265
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,967
Dental pick.

266
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:51,336
You think plaque
slows you down in the water?

267
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,705
They were looking
for something specific.

268
00:11:53,739 --> 00:11:55,090
You don't rip through a mattress

269
00:11:55,622 --> 00:11:57,103
unless you've run out
of places to look.

270
00:11:57,223 --> 00:12:00,001
Maybe they didn't find
what they were looking for.

271
00:12:00,121 --> 00:12:04,081
Maybe it's still here, but it's just
too well hidden. (Air whooshes)

272
00:12:04,116 --> 00:12:06,284
What?

273
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:12,156
(Paper rustles)

274
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:14,692
(Camera shutter clicks)

275
00:12:14,726 --> 00:12:18,396
(Glass clattering)

276
00:12:20,065 --> 00:12:21,332
Medication?

277
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,134
Only one thing I know of

278
00:12:23,168 --> 00:12:24,357
comes in little vials like that.

279
00:12:24,804 --> 00:12:29,140
Anabolic steroids.
Zack's clean. Why would he have steroids?

280
00:12:29,174 --> 00:12:31,976
Maybe he's not as clean
as we thought.

281
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:38,649
Sync & corrections by honeybunny
www.addic7ed.com

282
00:12:45,608 --> 00:12:47,689
Yep, it's steroids all right.

283
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,848
I thought you said Zack
wasn't using steroids.

284
00:12:49,968 --> 00:12:52,917
The test wouldn't pick up stuff like this.
Why not?

285
00:12:53,037 --> 00:12:56,385
It's loaded with masking agents
and designed to beat the test...

286
00:12:56,419 --> 00:12:59,661
Virtually untraceable unless
you look for it specifically.

287
00:12:59,781 --> 00:13:01,690
- So he was using.
- Nope.

288
00:13:02,421 --> 00:13:04,519
I went back and tested
for this, too.

289
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,069
Your boy is steroid-free.

290
00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:07,637
Well, if he wasn't
using steroids,

291
00:13:07,757 --> 00:13:10,644
then what was he doing with them?
Virtually undetectable?

292
00:13:10,764 --> 00:13:13,411
Where does a drug like that come from?
There's been some talk about

293
00:13:13,531 --> 00:13:15,941
a new beat-the-test
performance-enhancing drug

294
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,017
being developed
somewhere in Eastern Europe.

295
00:13:18,137 --> 00:13:20,075
Eastern Europe...

296
00:13:20,952 --> 00:13:23,845
Home of
the hard-to-identify accent.

297
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,686
Given how great
everyone says Zack was,

298
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,088
this whole steroids thing
just doesn't make sense.

299
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,621
Well, we know
he needed the money.

300
00:13:30,741 --> 00:13:32,568
If he wasn't using, maybe he was dealing.

301
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:35,138
Well, that definitely would've given him
the cash needed to make ends meet.

302
00:13:35,258 --> 00:13:37,024
Yeah, but he only had a couple of vials.

303
00:13:37,144 --> 00:13:38,493
Maybe he was low on inventory,

304
00:13:38,528 --> 00:13:41,520
<i>and</i> the man
Zack was arguing with,

305
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,693
our secretive Slav,
he was the distributor.

306
00:13:44,994 --> 00:13:46,168
If there even was a man.

307
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:48,208
For all we know,
Bridget was lying.

308
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,937
Well, she wasn't lying
about her brothers.

309
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,012
I talked to all four of them,

310
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:56,191
one Irishman to another
and another.

311
00:13:56,311 --> 00:13:57,940
Anyway, they alibied out.

312
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,785
They were in New Paltz
when Zack was killed.

313
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,405
All of them?
Mm-hmm.

314
00:14:01,525 --> 00:14:02,772
For what?

315
00:14:03,182 --> 00:14:06,404
They were at a sporting event
of a... sorts.

316
00:14:06,438 --> 00:14:09,273
Which was?

317
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:12,443
Leprechaun toss.
Don't ask.

318
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:15,415
Anyway, the, uh, older brother,
he got first place.

319
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:16,328
Oh, man.

320
00:14:16,448 --> 00:14:18,528
Well, the merits
of Irish culture aside...

321
00:14:18,648 --> 00:14:19,662
Hey.
Sorry.

322
00:14:19,782 --> 00:14:22,469
Perhaps this suggests that
Bridget was telling the truth

323
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:27,136
about our elusive Estonian.
I'll run the sketch past Narco and Vice,

324
00:14:27,256 --> 00:14:30,079
see if they recognize him.
Okay, and check if Zack was on their radar.

325
00:14:32,035 --> 00:14:34,185
And, Esposito, can you
talk to Zack's teammates

326
00:14:34,305 --> 00:14:35,966
about the steroids,
find out what they knew?

327
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,968
Zack would never touch steroids.

328
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:39,140
None of us would.

329
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,440
Mm-hmm.
Look, the fact of the matter is,

330
00:14:42,474 --> 00:14:45,937
Zack was clean, but we found
steroids at his place.

331
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:47,712
We're just trying
to figure out why.

332
00:14:47,746 --> 00:14:51,082
Are you saying you think Zack was a dealer?
Look, it's not enough that he's dead.

333
00:14:51,116 --> 00:14:52,581
Now you gotta drag him
through the mud?

334
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:54,221
Let me tell you something
about Zack Lindsey...

335
00:14:54,341 --> 00:14:56,091
He was the heart and soul
of this team.

336
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:57,663
He was the person
we wanted to be.

337
00:14:57,936 --> 00:15:00,765
So if you found drugs, they were
there for another reason.

338
00:15:01,121 --> 00:15:04,305
Whatever the reason,
he was up to something.

339
00:15:04,425 --> 00:15:06,436
Statements from three
of his neighbors say that

340
00:15:06,556 --> 00:15:08,395
he was going out
and staying out all night.

341
00:15:08,515 --> 00:15:10,935
Yes, to the pool to train.
We already know that.

342
00:15:10,969 --> 00:15:13,132
Except half the time, he was
leaving without his gym bag,

343
00:15:13,252 --> 00:15:14,939
so where was he going?

344
00:15:14,973 --> 00:15:17,251
I'm hoping that you're
asking that just for effect

345
00:15:17,371 --> 00:15:18,943
because you already have
an answer.

346
00:15:18,977 --> 00:15:20,544
I-I got nothing.

347
00:15:20,612 --> 00:15:22,473
(Man) Maybe you're
looking at it wrong.

348
00:15:22,951 --> 00:15:24,851
Maybe the steroids have nothing
to do with his murder.

349
00:15:24,971 --> 00:15:26,368
Maybe they're your red herring.

350
00:15:26,488 --> 00:15:28,954
(Castle) Alex, so glad you made it.
(Hands slap together)

351
00:15:29,074 --> 00:15:31,141
Alex Conrad, please meet
detective Beckett.

352
00:15:31,261 --> 00:15:33,693
Detective Beckett,
Alex Conrad, my protégé.

353
00:15:33,813 --> 00:15:36,193
Nice to meet you.
It's a real pleasure, detective.

354
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:38,996
I have read "Heat Wave"
and "Naked Heat" so many times,

355
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,336
I feel like I know you...

356
00:15:40,456 --> 00:15:44,001
The piercing intelligence,
the self-assured beauty.

357
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,353
Oh, um, thank you.

358
00:15:46,473 --> 00:15:48,756
Uh, so what were you saying
about the steroids?

359
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:50,174
Well, nothing really.

360
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,810
I was just looking at the board,
and I noticed that this swimmer kid,

361
00:15:52,844 --> 00:15:54,344
he's caught between two worlds.

362
00:15:54,464 --> 00:15:56,221
Now if were writing the story,

363
00:15:56,341 --> 00:15:58,189
the steroids would just be
a red herring,

364
00:15:58,489 --> 00:15:59,411
and the real killer

365
00:15:59,531 --> 00:16:00,819
would be someone
from the old neighborhood.

366
00:16:03,344 --> 00:16:05,069
Uh, yeah. But, hey,
that's just me.

367
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:06,504
Clearly I'm new at this.

368
00:16:06,624 --> 00:16:08,527
Alex, don't worry.
It takes years of experience...

369
00:16:08,647 --> 00:16:11,463
No. No, you're right.
We don't have any proof

370
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,615
that his has anything to do
with the steroids.

371
00:16:13,735 --> 00:16:15,446
We've just been assuming.
We do need to look

372
00:16:15,566 --> 00:16:18,165
into Zack's old neighborhood as well.
Seriously? I was helpful?

373
00:16:18,285 --> 00:16:21,523
Yes. Yes, you were.
Yes, but you probably have lots of questions,

374
00:16:21,643 --> 00:16:23,181
so we should get going.

375
00:16:23,301 --> 00:16:25,231
Hey, uh,
if it's not overstepping,

376
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:27,160
uh, just in the interest of
keeping it real, I was wondering

377
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,660
if I could ask you a few questions

378
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,984
for the case I'm coming up with for
"Seriously Dead."

379
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,877
Why don't you just give me a buzz
when the two of you are done?

380
00:16:37,711 --> 00:16:40,366
I mean, if it's okay with you.
Why wouldn't it be okay?

381
00:16:40,486 --> 00:16:42,063
Okay.
Okay.

382
00:16:42,183 --> 00:16:45,362
It's so not okay. After
everything I've done for him,

383
00:16:45,397 --> 00:16:47,732
he goes and tries to steal
my muse.

384
00:16:47,852 --> 00:16:50,701
Muse thievery.
What's the punishment for that,

385
00:16:50,821 --> 00:16:52,612
five to ten in mythology jail?

386
00:16:52,732 --> 00:16:54,772
(Laughing)
Yes, you laugh.

387
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:56,681
(Laughs) Go ahead.
Laugh all you want.

388
00:16:56,801 --> 00:16:59,146
But now I finally know
what Obi-Wan Kenobi felt like

389
00:16:59,266 --> 00:17:01,568
when Darth Vader turned on him.
Oh.

390
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:04,148
I shoulda seen this coming.
You know what they're calling him

391
00:17:04,182 --> 00:17:06,455
down at Black Pawn Publishing?
No.

392
00:17:06,575 --> 00:17:10,087
Alex Conrad?
"The next Richard Castle."

393
00:17:10,121 --> 00:17:10,975
Oh.
Yes.

394
00:17:11,095 --> 00:17:13,091
I thought it was a compliment,
but, no.

395
00:17:13,211 --> 00:17:16,248
He's trying to replace me.
What are you gonna do?

396
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:20,931
I am going
on to richardcastle.net,

397
00:17:20,966 --> 00:17:26,604
I am going to remove my glowing
review of "Dead Serious,"

398
00:17:26,638 --> 00:17:30,975
and replace it with cover art
for "Heat Rises."

399
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,369
That ungrateful little weasel...
Dad, you ever think

400
00:17:33,489 --> 00:17:35,683
that maybe you're overreacting
a teensy bit?

401
00:17:35,803 --> 00:17:38,460
You ever think that maybe
he admires you so much

402
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,166
that spending time with Beckett
is to understand you better?

403
00:17:43,088 --> 00:17:45,556
Don't confuse me
with your reasonableness.

404
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,853
I'm just saying...

405
00:17:46,973 --> 00:17:50,494
Maybe he's not the nefarious
muse-snatcher you think he is.

406
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:52,997
Maybe you should
give him a chance.

407
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:57,801
Maybe...

408
00:17:57,836 --> 00:18:00,704
You're right.

409
00:18:00,739 --> 00:18:03,374
Okay, great. Thank you
for your cooperation.

410
00:18:03,408 --> 00:18:05,209
(Receiver clatters)

411
00:18:05,243 --> 00:18:06,977
Thank you.

412
00:18:07,012 --> 00:18:08,238
So Bridget McManus says that

413
00:18:08,358 --> 00:18:11,382
Zack didn't really run with
the Bensonhurst crowd anymore,

414
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,318
but she did give me a list

415
00:18:13,438 --> 00:18:15,960
of all of his
old neighborhood buddies.

416
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,802
Oh, how about I run it down?
Yeah, great.

417
00:18:18,922 --> 00:18:20,991
Yeah.

418
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:27,398
Muffins.

419
00:18:27,432 --> 00:18:29,867
Mm-hmm. Alex Conrad
sent them to me.

420
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:32,169
(Muffin thuds)
Alex.

421
00:18:34,105 --> 00:18:37,172
"Thanks for last night." Guess
you two got together last night.

422
00:18:37,292 --> 00:18:39,277
Yeah, we talked about procedure.

423
00:18:39,687 --> 00:18:42,997
Oh, so... nothing special.

424
00:18:43,117 --> 00:18:44,150
I don't know.

425
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,258
He said he was gonna use it all
for his next book,

426
00:18:46,378 --> 00:18:49,285
said next time he wants to talk about cases.
Next time?

427
00:18:49,544 --> 00:18:51,889
So something came up
on our victim.

428
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:53,783
Not sure what to make of it.
About steroids?

429
00:18:53,903 --> 00:18:55,935
No.
About our mysterious Moldavian?

430
00:18:56,055 --> 00:18:57,192
No, not that either.

431
00:18:57,312 --> 00:18:59,860
Vice and Narcotics struck out
on Zack and the sketch.

432
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,363
But I ran Zack's fingerprints

433
00:19:01,483 --> 00:19:03,233
through the unsolved
latent database.

434
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:04,486
His prints match a set

435
00:19:04,606 --> 00:19:07,071
found on a car stolen in Queens
two weeks ago.

436
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:08,721
Who's the owner?

437
00:19:08,841 --> 00:19:10,490
A Patricia Farrell.

438
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:13,577
Name doesn't ring a bell.

439
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:16,580
I think I know...
What these are about.

440
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:20,184
It's, um, a video I saw

441
00:19:20,218 --> 00:19:22,525
on an underground web site
a while ago.

442
00:19:22,645 --> 00:19:23,465
Not surprising.
(Clicking keyboard keys)

443
00:19:23,585 --> 00:19:27,358
Just watch.
Hmm.

444
00:19:27,392 --> 00:19:28,768
(Beep)
Here.

445
00:19:30,261 --> 00:19:33,564
(Air hissing)

446
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:40,001
So that's how Zack made
tuition and rent

447
00:19:40,121 --> 00:19:43,221
all without a job.
Oh, Zack had a job all right.

448
00:19:43,341 --> 00:19:45,943
He was a car thief.
(Air hisses)

449
00:19:52,174 --> 00:19:54,045
Now we know how Zack
made his money,

450
00:19:54,046 --> 00:19:56,561
why he was out all night...
He was playing Grand Theft Auto.

451
00:19:56,681 --> 00:19:58,146
Yeah, the live-action version.

452
00:19:58,266 --> 00:20:00,415
Maybe he boosted the wrong car
and got in trouble

453
00:20:00,535 --> 00:20:03,413
with the people he was working with.
Our lethal Lithuanian, perhaps?

454
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:04,534
Guess again, bro.

455
00:20:04,654 --> 00:20:06,693
I ran the names of Zack's pals
from Bensonhurst.

456
00:20:06,813 --> 00:20:09,829
One of them has a prior for auto theft...
a Thomas Marcone.

457
00:20:09,949 --> 00:20:11,838
Tommy Marcone?
Bridget said that

458
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:15,682
that was Zack's best friend in high school.
Lots of car thieves run in pairs.

459
00:20:15,802 --> 00:20:18,142
Let's go to Bensonhurst.

460
00:20:18,939 --> 00:20:20,511
That's it. Scanlon's bar...

461
00:20:20,631 --> 00:20:22,813
Tommy Marcone's
unofficial hangout.

462
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:25,749
Looks like the neighborhood
is mourning their local hero.

463
00:20:25,784 --> 00:20:29,153
Yeah, well, at this point,
I'm not sure that's what he was.

464
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:30,654
Man born into hardship

465
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:32,656
struggles to reach
for something greater,

466
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:34,658
only he can't escape
the demons of his past.

467
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:36,527
It's "Oedipus,"
it's "The Godfather,"

468
00:20:36,561 --> 00:20:38,162
"The Beverly Hillbillies."

469
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:39,963
(Laughs)
It wasn't that funny.

470
00:20:39,998 --> 00:20:42,366
No, I'm sorry.
I just got a message.

471
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,102
From who? Conrad? It is,
isn't it? What did he say?

472
00:20:45,136 --> 00:20:47,235
Nothing. He just wants to know
what time I can meet up tonight.

473
00:20:47,355 --> 00:20:48,620
And that made you laugh?

474
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,207
Yeah.

475
00:20:50,241 --> 00:20:51,653
He's funny.

You got the wrong guy.

00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,764
Remember when?

483
00:21:10,884 --> 00:21:13,319
You're still on probation, aren't you?
(Sighs)

484
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:16,080
Got a couple of questions
about Zack Lindsey's murder.

485
00:21:16,326 --> 00:21:18,102
Why you gotta sweat me
in front of the whole bar?

486
00:21:18,222 --> 00:21:19,688
What do you want me to do,
take you downtown?

487
00:21:20,084 --> 00:21:22,326
I know that the two of you were stealing
cars together.

488
00:21:22,446 --> 00:21:23,281
You can't prove that.

489
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,776
I know that the two of you
were friends,

490
00:21:24,896 --> 00:21:27,154
I know that I've got
Zack's prints on a stolen car,

491
00:21:27,274 --> 00:21:29,163
and I also know
that you have priors.

492
00:21:29,573 --> 00:21:31,781
And since you two
are friends, we thought

493
00:21:31,901 --> 00:21:33,653
maybe you'd care that Zack's
laying on a slab

494
00:21:33,773 --> 00:21:34,952
and thought
you might want to help him.

495
00:21:35,072 --> 00:21:38,526
He's dead. Ain't nothing I can do now.

496
00:21:38,646 --> 00:21:40,015
Why don't you tell me where you were

497
00:21:40,135 --> 00:21:41,888
between 1:00 and 5:00 A.M.
the night of the murder?

498
00:21:42,008 --> 00:21:44,595
You're wasting your time.

499
00:21:44,629 --> 00:21:46,718
You ever see this man?

500
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:48,946
No, and your watch is
too expensive for a cop's.

501
00:21:49,066 --> 00:21:51,568
So, detective, who's this guy?

502
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:54,371
<i>♪ Idle hands ♪</i>

503
00:21:54,405 --> 00:21:56,655
He's the guy buying a round

504
00:21:58,664 --> 00:22:00,687
Tommy, if you know something,
you should talk.

505
00:22:00,807 --> 00:22:02,305
(Castle) Hey, everybody,
a round for the house

506
00:22:02,425 --> 00:22:03,672
in memory of Zack Lindsey.

507
00:22:03,792 --> 00:22:06,431
(Cheers, whistles, and applause)

508
00:22:06,551 --> 00:22:08,752
Zack was a great kid.

509
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:11,255
Everybody around here loved him,

510
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:13,757
Tommy included.

511
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:15,759
(Esposito) Well,
the guy in the sketch

512
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:17,461
is definitely Jimmy Lennon...

513
00:22:17,495 --> 00:22:19,129
Grand theft auto,

514
00:22:19,164 --> 00:22:21,598
conspiracy to sell

516
00:22:24,502 --> 00:22:27,104
He immigrated to the U.S.
when he was 28,

517
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:29,506
but he was born Janusz Lenadovsky

518
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:30,974
in Minsk, Belarus.

519
00:22:31,009 --> 00:22:33,610
Belarus. I knew it.
That's right next to Lithuania.

520
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:35,712
(Whirs)

521
00:22:35,747 --> 00:22:39,783
It says here that he owns
an auto repair shop on Avenview.

522
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:42,419
Watch your backs on this one.
This guy is dangerous.

523
00:22:42,453 --> 00:22:45,556
(Buzzing)

524
00:22:50,094 --> 00:22:53,397
(Men arguing indistinctly)

525
00:22:53,431 --> 00:22:54,464
There.

526
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:56,733
Jimmy Lennon.

531
00:23:08,146 --> 00:23:12,149
Hey! Hey! NYPD!

532
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:15,571
This is clean business. I fix these cars.
Really?

533
00:23:15,691 --> 00:23:18,895
I bet the people who own them
would be surprised to hear that.

534
00:23:19,015 --> 00:23:21,959
Now I want to know about Zack Lindsey.
I know nothing.

535
00:23:21,993 --> 00:23:24,079
Not the best three words to have
falling out of your mouth, Jimmy.

536
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:26,362
I was half expecting "moose"
and "squirrel."

537
00:23:26,482 --> 00:23:28,945
You're going to jail.
How long depends on you.

538
00:23:29,065 --> 00:23:30,954
Jail in your country is vacation.

539
00:23:31,074 --> 00:23:33,604
Then I will make it
very difficult.

540
00:23:33,638 --> 00:23:37,341
Here's what I think... I think
that Zack stole cars for you.

541
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:40,043
But he had bigger plans,
and he told you he wanted out.

542
00:23:40,078 --> 00:23:42,546
You were worried
he couldn't keep his mouth shut,

543
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,014
so you threatened him

544
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:46,641
and told him,
there's no walking outta this.

545
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:48,882
And when he didn't change
his mind, you followed him

546
00:23:49,002 --> 00:23:50,081
to the pool and you killed him.

547
00:23:50,201 --> 00:23:52,158
Is there anything
you want to add to that?

548
00:23:55,126 --> 00:23:58,395
You should help yourself, Jimmy.
This is your last chance.

549
00:23:58,429 --> 00:24:01,198
(Police radio chatter)

550
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:03,033
Swim for gold.

551
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:05,135
What?

552
00:24:05,169 --> 00:24:06,837
There's a car over there

553
00:24:06,871 --> 00:24:09,873
with the license plate
"swm4gld."

554
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:11,708
(Fabric snaps)

555
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:13,410
Oh-oh-oh-oh.

556
00:24:13,444 --> 00:24:15,812
This car is registered
to a Brian Morris

557
00:24:15,847 --> 00:24:18,315
of Greenwich, Connecticut.

558
00:24:18,383 --> 00:24:20,918
Brian Morris.
That's one of Zack's teammates.

559
00:24:20,952 --> 00:24:22,586
That's his main rival.

560
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:26,223
So either Brian needed
his engine rebuilt or...

561
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:28,258
Or this car is stolen.

562
00:24:28,293 --> 00:24:31,228
So why would Zack
steal Brian's car?

563
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:34,398
I don't know. But I know why it
gave Brian a motive for murder.

564
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:37,367
Those steroids we found
in Zack's apartment...

565
00:24:37,402 --> 00:24:39,903
Mm-hmm.
That he wasn't taking?

566
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:41,939
Maybe they're Brian's.

567
00:24:51,883 --> 00:24:53,864
Why you got me in here?
I didn't do nothin' wrong.

568
00:24:53,984 --> 00:24:57,623
No? Zack's rival on
the swim team, Brian Morris,

569
00:24:57,743 --> 00:24:59,289
we found his stingray
at the chop shop...

570
00:24:59,324 --> 00:25:01,091
the one you stole.

571
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,094
I don't even know
what that means.

572
00:25:03,613 --> 00:25:05,619
Zack's prints were on it,
and so were yours.

573
00:25:05,739 --> 00:25:07,286
So stop playing around.

574
00:25:08,694 --> 00:25:10,600
Why did you boost the car?

575
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:14,204
(Sighs) Because Brian Morris
is a silver-spoon-licking punk.

576
00:25:14,238 --> 00:25:16,174
He hated Zack
for being a better swimmer.

577
00:25:16,294 --> 00:25:19,609
Two weeks ago, he spiked Zack's
pregame meal to make him sick.

578
00:25:19,644 --> 00:25:20,774
Zack won the meet anyway.

579
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,769
Didn't take him long to
figure out it was Brian, though.

580
00:25:23,534 --> 00:25:27,665
So you took the car out of revenge?
"Swm4gld" vanity plates...

581
00:25:27,785 --> 00:25:29,720
I mean, can you get
any more douchey?

582
00:25:29,754 --> 00:25:32,020
Brian's up in Greenwich
with his own training pool,

583
00:25:32,077 --> 00:25:33,462
private coaches,
whatever he needs.

584
00:25:33,582 --> 00:25:36,469
Meanwhile Zack's stuck here
boosting cars just so he can eat

585
00:25:36,589 --> 00:25:38,304
'cause he can't take a nickel
of outside money

586
00:25:38,424 --> 00:25:40,931
or else he's done.
How did you find the steroids?

587
00:25:40,965 --> 00:25:42,499
You always search a car.

588
00:25:42,533 --> 00:25:44,801
You never want more
than you bargained for.

589
00:25:44,836 --> 00:25:47,437
Like a dead mobster in the trunk?
That stuff happens.

590
00:25:47,472 --> 00:25:48,699
We searched the car like always,

591
00:25:48,819 --> 00:25:49,983
Zack found a bag
underneath the seat,

592
00:25:50,103 --> 00:25:51,559
and he knew right then and there,
Brian was juicing.

593
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,855
Did Zack have any plans
for this information?

594
00:25:53,975 --> 00:25:56,890
He hadn't figured that out yet.
Kind of a big deal, you know?

595
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:58,966
I told him he should turn that
cheating bastard Brian in,

596
00:25:59,086 --> 00:26:01,924
get his ass banned.
Guess he never got the chance.

597
00:26:02,044 --> 00:26:05,170
I guess not.
Zack was supposed to be your friend, Tommy.

598
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:07,080
Why didn't you tell us this
from the start?

599
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:10,827
I don't know. Maybe...

600
00:26:10,862 --> 00:26:13,263
I was scared.

601
00:26:13,297 --> 00:26:15,332
All right. Stick around.

602
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:17,734
I'm not done with you.
(Folder thuds)

603
00:26:17,769 --> 00:26:19,114
You recognize this, Brian?

604
00:26:19,234 --> 00:26:20,741
(Man) If it's gonna be adversarial
from the outset, detective...

605
00:26:20,861 --> 00:26:23,269
How's this for adversarial, counselor?

606
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:26,009
Zack Lindsey was killed
after he found

607
00:26:26,044 --> 00:26:28,645
<i>a cache of illegal steroids</i>
<i>in your client's car.</i>

608
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:30,480
<i>A car he apparently stole.</i>

609
00:26:30,515 --> 00:26:33,016
<i>And oddly enough, your son</i>
<i>never, ever reported it...</i>

610
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:34,985
She's like a tiger in there.

611
00:26:35,019 --> 00:26:37,009
I never get tired of watching her.
Me neither.

612
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:39,259
Seems like Alex Conrad
feels the same way.

613
00:26:39,379 --> 00:26:40,257
<i>...Was gone. </i>

614
00:26:40,377 --> 00:26:42,846
<i>A classic car worth
over 70 grand goes missing,</i>

615
00:26:42,966 --> 00:26:46,229
and you're telling me that
you had no idea it was gone?

616
00:26:46,264 --> 00:26:50,000
Why would I? I...
I barely even drive it.

617
00:26:50,034 --> 00:26:52,702
You <i>knew</i> that car was stolen.

618
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:54,704
You didn't want
police to recover it

619
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:57,274
in case they found more of these.
You have no proof of that.

620
00:26:57,308 --> 00:27:00,911
Zack could've planted
steroids in Brian's car.

621
00:27:00,945 --> 00:27:02,312
But he didn't.

622
00:27:02,346 --> 00:27:04,881
You know, I think that Zack
confronted you

623
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:06,850
about those steroids.

624
00:27:06,884 --> 00:27:09,019
And you knew if he reported you,
you could kiss

625
00:27:09,053 --> 00:27:11,555
your olympic dreams good-bye,
and so you killed him.

626
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:13,890
Brian, you killed Zack,

627
00:27:13,925 --> 00:27:16,993
and then you
broke into his apartment

628
00:27:17,028 --> 00:27:19,296
and tried to cover your tracks.

629
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:20,864
(Clears throat)

630
00:27:20,898 --> 00:27:23,166
To my recollection,

631
00:27:23,201 --> 00:27:25,535
at no point did Zack Lindsey
and I discuss

632
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:28,705
any performance-enhancing
substance.

633
00:27:28,739 --> 00:27:30,707
And I have no idea
who killed him.

634
00:27:30,741 --> 00:27:33,443
Not a gold medal performance,
Brian.

635
00:27:33,478 --> 00:27:35,645
Where were you
between 1:00 and 5:00 A.M.

636
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,381
the night of the murder?
<i>We've been over all this.</i>

637
00:27:38,416 --> 00:27:40,317
<i>I was at the practice pool</i>
<i>at my parents' house.</i>

638
00:27:40,351 --> 00:27:43,587
This DVD is from a camera
mounted above the training pool.

639
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:46,690
It has the date and time running in the corner.
Easily altered.

640
00:27:46,724 --> 00:27:49,092
Furthermore, the Morris family
and staff all swear

641
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:52,329
Brian was at home, and I have affidavits.
I'm sure you do.

642
00:27:52,363 --> 00:27:56,066
So unless you're charging
my client, we're done here.

643
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,035
My son will go to the Olympics,

644
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:01,938
and no one's going to
derail that, detective.

645
00:28:01,973 --> 00:28:04,841
(People speaking indistinctly)

646
00:28:04,876 --> 00:28:06,843
Brian had means, he had motive.

647
00:28:06,878 --> 00:28:09,346
That's at least two.
What about opportunity?

648
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,348
Clearly, his father would do
whatever it takes

649
00:28:11,382 --> 00:28:13,383
to cover for him
so he can keep on swimming.

650
00:28:13,417 --> 00:28:15,852
Well, with the kind of team
Brian had, there's no way

651
00:28:15,887 --> 00:28:18,622
we'll be able to prove that
he was at the U.N.Y. pool.

652
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:20,524
Maybe because he wasn't.

653
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:23,393
Look what kind of guy
Brian is... pampered,

654
00:28:23,427 --> 00:28:25,462
protected,
dominated by his father.

655
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:27,464
This is not a man of action.

656
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:28,544
So what are you suggesting?

657
00:28:28,664 --> 00:28:30,485
That he's not the kind of guy
to get his hands dirty.

658
00:28:30,605 --> 00:28:33,470
Maybe daddy cleaned up his mess.
Or he hired someone to do it for him.

659
00:28:33,538 --> 00:28:36,206
Ryan, can you look into
the Morris' financials?

660
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,075
Look for large payments made
around the time of the murder,

661
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,144
especially cash withdrawals.
Already on it.

662
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:43,146
The dad is a hedge fund manager,

663
00:28:43,181 --> 00:28:45,882
so you practically need
an M.B.A. to follow the money.

664
00:28:45,917 --> 00:28:48,051
But there was something
about the kid.

665
00:28:48,085 --> 00:28:49,920
There was a bond.
As in bail bond?

666
00:28:49,954 --> 00:28:52,756
As in savings bond. Three days
after Brian's car was stolen,

667
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:56,126
he cashed in a savings bond
in the amount of $25,000.

668
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,662
That's enough to hire a hit man.

669
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:00,463
Especially in today's
competitive job market.

670
00:29:00,498 --> 00:29:03,366
Did Brian Morris cash that bond
at Greenwich Federal Bank?

671
00:29:03,401 --> 00:29:06,036
Matter of fact, he did.
What do you got?

672
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:08,004
We just searched
Thomas Marcone's place.

673
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:10,207
Found tools
of the auto theft trade.

674
00:29:10,274 --> 00:29:12,309
But we also found this.

675
00:29:12,343 --> 00:29:13,977
That looks like 25 grand.

676
00:29:14,011 --> 00:29:16,546
And guess where it's from.

677
00:29:16,581 --> 00:29:19,182
Greenwich Federal Bank.

678
00:29:19,217 --> 00:29:21,518
I didn't kill Zack.
Tommy, it seems like

679
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:24,020
every time you open your mouth,
another lie falls out.

680
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:27,224
But I'm not lying. Then why did you
take 25 grand from Brian Morris?

681
00:29:27,258 --> 00:29:29,559
A man you characterized
as a "cheating bastard,"

682
00:29:29,594 --> 00:29:31,261
as I recall.

683
00:29:31,295 --> 00:29:33,230
Okay, I may have gotten
Zack killed,

684
00:29:33,264 --> 00:29:35,532
but not the way you think.

685
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:38,768
It was blackmail.
You blackmailed Brian Morris.

686
00:29:38,803 --> 00:29:40,237
Him being on steroids...

687
00:29:40,271 --> 00:29:42,372
Yeah, I figured that knowledge
was worth something.

688
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:44,541
Was Zack in on this?
He woulda kicked my ass

689
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:48,178
up and down 18th Avenue if he found out.
And been justified.

690
00:29:48,212 --> 00:29:51,348
Look, Brian didn't know me,
and I figured, he wouldn't pay

691
00:29:51,382 --> 00:29:53,483
if he got blackmailed
by some anonymous mook.

692
00:29:53,517 --> 00:29:55,986
So you pretended to be Zack.

693
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,488
I used the library computer
and Zack's e-mail account.

694
00:29:58,522 --> 00:29:59,923
I emailed Brian

695
00:29:59,957 --> 00:30:02,926
saying I had his 'roids
and I was gonna rat him out

696
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,395
unless he put 25 grand
into a paper bag

697
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:08,498
and left it underneath
a bench at the quad.

698
00:30:08,532 --> 00:30:11,201
When the coast was clear,
I picked it up.

699
00:30:11,235 --> 00:30:13,903
I never meant
for anyone to get hurt.

700
00:30:16,407 --> 00:30:20,243
I'd like that phone call now.

701
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:24,014
Okay, so Zack stole Brian's stash

702
00:30:24,048 --> 00:30:26,016
and because of Tommy,

703
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:31,655
Brian thought that Zack...
Was blackmailing him.

704
00:30:31,689 --> 00:30:36,226
Brian's motive just keeps
getting stronger and stronger.

705
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,495
Almost like it's on steroids.

706
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:43,033
Ms. Dinovi.
Tommy Marcone called,

707
00:30:43,067 --> 00:30:44,768
said you have him in here.

708
00:30:44,802 --> 00:30:47,370
He said Brian Morris killed my son.
We don't know all that.

709
00:30:47,405 --> 00:30:49,606
We just know he's a person of interest.
So why didn't you arrest him?

710
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,375
We don't have enough to hold him.
And he's the son of a millionaire.

711
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:54,878
I bet that doesn't hurt either.
Around here, it's about the evidence,

712
00:30:54,912 --> 00:30:56,746
not how fat someone's wallet is.

713
00:30:56,781 --> 00:30:58,748
Yeah, well,
I live in the real world,

714
00:30:58,783 --> 00:31:01,584
and I know that boy's family,
and they're gonna do

715
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:06,122
whatever it takes to protect him
because they can.

716
00:31:06,157 --> 00:31:09,626
(Sniffles) Captain...
Zack's all I had.

717
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,960
(Sobs)

718
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:13,797
We can't figure out if Brian
is connected to the murder

719
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:15,899
until we find the real killer.

720
00:31:15,933 --> 00:31:17,901
Then you're gonna
have to dig deeper.

721
00:31:17,935 --> 00:31:20,036
If Brian and his family
are involved, then there's

722
00:31:20,071 --> 00:31:23,206
gotta be a connection,
and I want it found.

723
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:32,315
All right, great.
Thank you.

724
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,417
We struck out again.
The Morris' house in Connecticut

725
00:31:34,452 --> 00:31:36,953
is gated,
and the security company says

726
00:31:36,987 --> 00:31:38,922
that nobody left
the night of the murder.

727
00:31:38,956 --> 00:31:41,358
These guys have everything covered.
Hmm.

728
00:31:41,392 --> 00:31:42,792
What?

729
00:31:42,827 --> 00:31:44,494
Zack's e-mail account,

730
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:47,163
the one Tommy used
to ask Brian for a donation?

731
00:31:47,198 --> 00:31:49,299
The blackmail message was sent
at 3:02 P.M.

732
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:53,136
You'd think that would've caused
a flurry of telephone calls.

733
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:56,005
But he only made one call
right after... 3:19.

734
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,376
That's the father's office
in New York.

735
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:01,711
Do we have the dad's records?

736
00:32:01,746 --> 00:32:04,481
Yeah, I got it right here.
Starting at 3:21 P.M.,

737
00:32:04,515 --> 00:32:07,484
Benjamin Morris made
about a dozen phone calls,

738
00:32:07,518 --> 00:32:09,886
all to the same 2-1-2 number.

739
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,222
Run it.

740
00:32:12,256 --> 00:32:15,358
It's a Dr. Rex Colabro.

741
00:32:15,393 --> 00:32:17,494
He's got
a sports medicine practice.

742
00:32:17,528 --> 00:32:20,463
He's got a lot of
big-time athletes as clients.

743
00:32:20,498 --> 00:32:22,132
So Benjamin Morris finds out

744
00:32:22,166 --> 00:32:24,701
that his son
is being blackmailed,

745
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:27,537
and the one phone call
he makes is to Dr. Colabro?

746
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:30,340
The only reason that
that would make sense is if...

747
00:32:30,374 --> 00:32:32,342
Dr. Colabro knew about
the steroids,

748
00:32:32,376 --> 00:32:33,910
maybe even supplied them.

749
00:32:33,944 --> 00:32:36,780
I don't supply steroids
to anyone.

750
00:32:36,814 --> 00:32:38,982
Never have. Never will.

751
00:32:39,016 --> 00:32:40,984
I've seen the long-term damage
they cause.

752
00:32:41,018 --> 00:32:43,086
As far as I'm concerned,
the stuff's poison.

753
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,688
And what about Brian Morris?
Is he a patient of yours?

754
00:32:45,723 --> 00:32:48,291
That's confidential information.

755
00:32:50,127 --> 00:32:52,262
His father called you seven times

756
00:32:52,296 --> 00:32:54,998
in a 2-hour period
on Tuesday.

757
00:32:55,032 --> 00:32:58,034
What did the two of you talk about?
That's confidential as well.

758
00:32:58,068 --> 00:33:00,503
Dr. Colabro, your clientele
is mostly high-profile athletes.

759
00:33:00,538 --> 00:33:02,505
How fast do you think
they'll abandon ship

760
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,408
once they find out you're talking with
us about steroids? I'm guessing fast.

761
00:33:05,443 --> 00:33:08,611
And when they find out
it's steroids and murder,

762
00:33:08,646 --> 00:33:12,348
it'll jump to light speed. Murder?
(Scoffs) You think I'm mixed up in a murder?

763
00:33:12,383 --> 00:33:14,851
I think that it would be
in your best interest

764
00:33:14,885 --> 00:33:16,853
to help us.
Tell us what you

765
00:33:16,887 --> 00:33:18,688
and Benjamin Morris talked about.

766
00:33:18,722 --> 00:33:20,857
And point of fact...

767
00:33:20,891 --> 00:33:25,361
Brian was your patient, but I'm
guessing his father was not.

768
00:33:25,429 --> 00:33:28,064
So confidentiality
really doesn't apply.

769
00:33:28,098 --> 00:33:29,732
How's this?

770
00:33:29,767 --> 00:33:33,102
Hypothetically...

771
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:35,271
Why would an overbearing father

772
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:37,774
of a steroid-using swimmer
call you?

773
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:40,477
"Hypothetically"...

774
00:33:40,511 --> 00:33:43,313
He might have asked how long
a certain banned drug

775
00:33:43,347 --> 00:33:45,615
would remain detectable
in someone's system.

776
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:48,585
Worried his son would test positive.
And what else might have come up?

777
00:33:48,619 --> 00:33:50,587
That the way an athlete
can avoid testing

778
00:33:50,621 --> 00:33:52,255
is if he's injured

779
00:33:52,289 --> 00:33:54,290
and temporarily withdraws
from the sport.

780
00:33:54,325 --> 00:33:55,425
Hypothetically.

781
00:33:55,459 --> 00:33:57,260
Hypothetically.

782
00:33:57,294 --> 00:34:00,563
I'll get a warrant, check
Colabro's office for steroids.

783
00:34:00,598 --> 00:34:02,065
You won't find any.

784
00:34:02,099 --> 00:34:04,067
Benjamin called in
to concoct a strategy

785
00:34:04,101 --> 00:34:05,735
to protect Brian's eligibility.

786
00:34:05,803 --> 00:34:08,171
This is damage control
not murder.

787
00:34:08,205 --> 00:34:11,174
Well, it looks like the strategy
has been put into effect.

788
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:13,576
Brian quit the swim team,
said he injured his shoulder.

789
00:34:13,611 --> 00:34:16,646
No swim team, no drug testing.
Mm-hmm.

790
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,648
So I checked Lanie's report
on the steroids

791
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:20,450
against the file I got from Vice.

792
00:34:20,484 --> 00:34:23,353
They intercepted a shipment
of similar steroids

793
00:34:23,387 --> 00:34:26,823
that came to New York from a lab in Romania.
So let's look into Brian's life,

794
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:29,259
see if there's any connection
to Romania.

795
00:34:29,293 --> 00:34:31,461
If we can find a connect,
then hopefully we'll be able

796
00:34:31,495 --> 00:34:33,630
to find Zack's killer.
Kate, you ready?

797
00:34:33,664 --> 00:34:36,299
Yeah. Um, let me
just go get my purse.

798
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:38,301
You guys are going out
again tonight?

799
00:34:38,335 --> 00:34:40,303
What can I say?
She's a wealth of information.

800
00:34:40,337 --> 00:34:42,305
You are lucky to have her.

801
00:34:42,339 --> 00:34:44,474
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

802
00:34:44,508 --> 00:34:46,509
Too bad about tonight, though.

803
00:34:46,544 --> 00:34:47,977
Too bad how?

804
00:34:48,012 --> 00:34:51,114
Well, it's poker night. Lehane
and Connelly are in town.

805
00:34:51,148 --> 00:34:53,116
I thought
you might want to join us,

806
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,851
but if you have plans.
No way. You're...

807
00:34:54,971 --> 00:34:56,792
You're inviting me
to your mystery writers' poker night?

808
00:34:56,912 --> 00:34:58,732
Well, come on.
You're a mystery writer now, right?

809
00:34:58,989 --> 00:35:01,324
Yeah, but those guys
are legendary. I mean, uh...

810
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:03,226
(laughs) Yeah.
Yeah, they are.

811
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:06,162
Ah, well.
If you're unavailable...

812
00:35:06,196 --> 00:35:08,131
(Whispering)
Three, two, one.

813
00:35:08,165 --> 00:35:09,632
Well, wait, wait, wait.

814
00:35:09,667 --> 00:35:11,901
Bingo.

815
00:35:11,936 --> 00:35:14,470
Hang on a second.

816
00:35:14,505 --> 00:35:17,440
(Normal voice)
Oh, yeah.

817
00:35:17,474 --> 00:35:20,510
They're gonna <i>love</i> you.

818
00:35:20,544 --> 00:35:23,413
Gentlemen.
This the new guy?

819
00:35:23,447 --> 00:35:25,982
Alex Conrad, Michael Connelly,
Dennis Lehane.

820
00:35:26,016 --> 00:35:27,984
It's really awesome
to meet you guys.

821
00:35:28,018 --> 00:35:29,519
I am a, uh, huge fan.

822
00:35:29,553 --> 00:35:33,056
It's not a book signing, kid.
We're here to play poker.

823
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,691
Right.

824
00:35:34,725 --> 00:35:36,726
Ah, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh.

825
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,595
That's Cannell's seat.

826
00:35:38,629 --> 00:35:40,430
Oh.
That's the rule.

827
00:35:40,464 --> 00:35:44,033
We lose a member,
nobody sits there for a year.

828
00:35:45,603 --> 00:35:47,337
Okay.

829
00:35:47,371 --> 00:35:49,038
Sorry.

830
00:35:49,073 --> 00:35:52,442
So we were just talking about
our books becoming movies.

831
00:35:52,476 --> 00:35:54,110
Michael had "Lincoln Lawyer,"

832
00:35:54,144 --> 00:35:57,180
I had "Shutter Island,"
Ricky has "Heat Wave."

833
00:35:57,214 --> 00:35:59,182
So what about your book, kid?

834
00:35:59,216 --> 00:36:01,184
They gonna make it into a movie?

835
00:36:01,218 --> 00:36:03,920
Oh, uh, not yet.

836
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:06,889
So, Ricky, what's going on
with the dead swimmer?

837
00:36:06,924 --> 00:36:08,858
Treading water.
Dennis, your bet.

838
00:36:08,892 --> 00:36:11,461
Well, it reads like
a crime of passion to me.

839
00:36:11,495 --> 00:36:14,764
I bet the girlfriend did it.
The girlfriend? You're kidding, right?

840
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:18,034
(Chips clatter) You move through the
girlfriend no later than page 50.

841
00:36:18,068 --> 00:36:20,303
(Dennis) Yeah, the woman scored
is like the oldest rodeo clown

842
00:36:20,337 --> 00:36:22,905
in the book.
Is he serious?

843
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,942
Oh, he's "dead serious."

844
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:28,378
Well, you know, I just thought we were...
How many books have you written?

845
00:36:28,412 --> 00:36:30,747
Just the one.
(Dennis) And this...

846
00:36:30,781 --> 00:36:32,815
And this one book made you,
like, a crime-solving genius,

847
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:35,451
did it? You know what I did
after I wrote my first novel?

848
00:36:35,486 --> 00:36:39,055
Hmm?
I shut up and I wrote 23 more.

849
00:36:39,089 --> 00:36:40,456
(Chuckles)

850
00:36:40,491 --> 00:36:42,279
I can tell ya, a case like this,

851
00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:45,061
guilty party is usually
the guy with the biggest secret.

852
00:36:45,095 --> 00:36:46,238
You know, Dennis is right.

853
00:36:46,358 --> 00:36:48,571
Aside from Brian, who has
the most to lose

854
00:36:48,691 --> 00:36:50,238
if this steroid use gets out?

855
00:36:53,604 --> 00:36:56,039
You know,
I think I might just know.

856
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,965
This is ridiculous.

857
00:37:04,085 --> 00:37:06,398
I was in my apartment
in faculty housing that night.

858
00:37:06,518 --> 00:37:07,546
You could just ask around.

859
00:37:07,666 --> 00:37:09,336
We know you were
in your apartment that night.

860
00:37:09,456 --> 00:37:12,027
Okay. So then why am I here?
Do you know what this is, coach?

861
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:14,091
Uh, yeah.
Everybody in my business does.

862
00:37:14,211 --> 00:37:15,939
But nobody on my team takes that stuff.

863
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:17,007
Brian Morris does.

864
00:37:17,127 --> 00:37:20,068
That's not true.
Apparently, this is his steroid of choice.

865
00:37:20,188 --> 00:37:21,623
It comes from Romania.

866
00:37:21,743 --> 00:37:24,586
I understand you've been to Romania four
times in the past two years.

867
00:37:24,706 --> 00:37:26,937
My wife's family is from Bucharest.

868
00:37:27,057 --> 00:37:28,908
So you're trying to tell me,
it's just a coincidence?

869
00:37:29,028 --> 00:37:31,507
- Yeah. - So if I search your apartment
and your office,

870
00:37:31,542 --> 00:37:35,478
you're telling me that I wouldn't find
<i>any</i> of these vials?

871
00:37:41,575 --> 00:37:42,645
You don't understand.

872
00:37:42,674 --> 00:37:44,552
Brian Morris was a lock to win it all.

873
00:37:45,218 --> 00:37:46,147
He had the body,

874
00:37:46,267 --> 00:37:49,005
he had the talent, the money
to make himself the best.

875
00:37:49,125 --> 00:37:50,992
He's the reason I came
to coach at U.N.Y.,

876
00:37:51,112 --> 00:37:53,095
but last year, Brian peaked,

877
00:37:53,215 --> 00:37:54,726
started fading
at the ends of races,

878
00:37:54,846 --> 00:37:56,762
and from outta nowhere, Zack became
the guy to beat.

879
00:37:56,882 --> 00:37:58,697
So you decided
to give Brian an extra  boost

880
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:01,204
so he could catch up with Zack.
Brian's father came to me.

881
00:38:01,739 --> 00:38:03,575
He asked if there was
anything more I could do,

882
00:38:03,695 --> 00:38:05,547
he said he'd donate millions
to the program

883
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:06,591
if that answer was yes.

884
00:38:06,711 --> 00:38:08,881
Yeah, but it wasn't just
about the money, was it?

885
00:38:09,001 --> 00:38:12,562
Every coach knows, he has to
hitch his wagon to a star.

886
00:38:12,682 --> 00:38:15,891
In fact, you'd done it before,
with somebody very special.

887
00:38:16,407 --> 00:38:19,856
Before going to U.N.Y.,
you were coaching in Wilmington.

888
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:21,735
That's right. So?

889
00:38:21,855 --> 00:38:24,467
You ever give that same boost
to your swimmers there?

890
00:38:25,709 --> 00:38:28,531
They keep those old samples,
don't they?

891
00:38:31,681 --> 00:38:33,798
Thanks so much, Rocket.
We really appreciate it.

892
00:38:33,918 --> 00:38:37,073
Oh, thank you so much
for the interview.

893
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:38,681
Detective Beckett,
Mr. Castle.

894
00:38:38,801 --> 00:38:40,608
How goes the investigation?
Any new leads?

895
00:38:40,728 --> 00:38:42,879
Actually, we think
we caught a break.

896
00:38:42,913 --> 00:38:45,348
Well, that's great.
Mm-hmm.

897
00:38:45,382 --> 00:38:47,683
Yes, it is. Well,
for everyone except you.

898
00:38:47,718 --> 00:38:50,604
I... I don't...

899
00:38:50,724 --> 00:38:52,421
Drop the act, Rob.

900
00:38:52,456 --> 00:38:54,557
We know how you got to be
the Rocket.

901
00:38:54,591 --> 00:38:57,059
Coach Rome told us about
how he gave you rocket fuel

902
00:38:57,094 --> 00:38:58,594
back in Wilmington

903
00:38:58,629 --> 00:39:01,564
and didn't stop
until you went all the way.

904
00:39:01,598 --> 00:39:03,283
What the hell
are you talking about?

905
00:39:03,403 --> 00:39:05,803
I have never juiced. I have
the test results to prove it.

906
00:39:05,923 --> 00:39:08,660
Yeah, but they weren't
testing for the right thing.

907
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,208
We checked your blood samples

908
00:39:10,335 --> 00:39:11,669
from the last gold medal race
you won

909
00:39:11,789 --> 00:39:16,006
against the designer steroids
that Zack found in Brian's car.

910
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,976
It came back positive.
There was a mistake.

911
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:21,347
And then off of that,
we got a warrant

912
00:39:21,467 --> 00:39:23,480
to search your hotel room,
where we found

913
00:39:23,515 --> 00:39:25,916
a shirt with chlorine on it...
pure chlorine...

914
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,584
the kind that killed Zack.

915
00:39:27,619 --> 00:39:29,620
We're waiting for D.N.A.
test results right now.

916
00:39:29,654 --> 00:39:32,656
No, I was at Buddha Bar
the whole night.

917
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:35,659
And it was packed there.
You could've easily slipped out

918
00:39:35,693 --> 00:39:37,728
and come back
without anyone noticing.

919
00:39:40,598 --> 00:39:43,000
(Scoffs)
This is ridiculous.

920
00:39:43,034 --> 00:39:45,002
Why would I kill Zack?

921
00:39:45,036 --> 00:39:47,571
Because when Zack found steroids
in Brian's car,

922
00:39:47,605 --> 00:39:49,606
he was conflicted
about what to do.

923
00:39:49,641 --> 00:39:51,241
So he sought counsel

924
00:39:51,276 --> 00:39:53,744
from the one guy
he knew he could trust...

925
00:39:53,778 --> 00:39:56,725
Captain America,
chest full of medals,

926
00:39:56,845 --> 00:39:58,081
guy on the cereal box.

927
00:39:58,116 --> 00:40:01,518
Only you realized,
coach Rome had given Brian

928
00:40:01,553 --> 00:40:03,264
the same steroids
he had given to you.

929
00:40:03,384 --> 00:40:06,128
And you knew that if Zack talked,
you would be found out.

930
00:40:06,248 --> 00:40:08,398
They'd erase your name
from the record books.

931
00:40:08,518 --> 00:40:09,847
They'd take away all your medals.

932
00:40:09,967 --> 00:40:12,129
You would lose everything.

933
00:40:12,163 --> 00:40:15,966
And there was no way
you were gonna let that happen.

934
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,168
Turn around.
(Handcuffs click)

935
00:40:18,203 --> 00:40:20,204
Take a long look, Rob.

936
00:40:20,238 --> 00:40:22,206
Where you're going...
(Clicking)

937
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,075
I don't think they have pools.
Let's go.

938
00:40:25,109 --> 00:40:27,110
(Castle)
You know, it is ironic...

939
00:40:27,145 --> 00:40:29,646
The one man Zack thought
he could trust... his mentor...

940
00:40:29,681 --> 00:40:31,015
turned out to be his killer.

941
00:40:31,135 --> 00:40:34,677
Yeah, speaking of mentor,
I heard that you guys

942
00:40:34,797 --> 00:40:36,153
were pretty hard
on Conrad last night.

943
00:40:36,187 --> 00:40:37,654
Hard on him?

944
00:40:37,689 --> 00:40:40,457
No, no, it was just
a little friendly hazing.

945
00:40:40,492 --> 00:40:42,526
To hear him describe it,
it sounds like

946
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,129
someone was trying to teach him a lesson.
(Laughs) What? Why would I want to do that?

947
00:40:46,164 --> 00:40:48,765
Because you didn't want him
to spend time with me.

948
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,968
That is completely...
True?

949
00:40:51,002 --> 00:40:53,971
(People speaking indistinctly)

950
00:40:54,005 --> 00:40:55,873
Yes. Fine.

951
00:40:55,907 --> 00:40:58,008
It's true. I'm jealous.

952
00:40:58,042 --> 00:40:59,943
There. I said it.

953
00:40:59,978 --> 00:41:01,612
I...

954
00:41:01,646 --> 00:41:03,614
I want you all to myself,

955
00:41:03,648 --> 00:41:06,250
and to have you spending time
with another writer,

956
00:41:06,284 --> 00:41:07,751
that upsets me.

957
00:41:07,785 --> 00:41:10,754
And if... if that
makes me petty, so be it.

958
00:41:10,788 --> 00:41:13,757
Guilty as charged.

959
00:41:15,326 --> 00:41:19,463
Actually, I kinda think
it's sweet.

960
00:41:19,497 --> 00:41:21,031
You do?

961
00:41:21,065 --> 00:41:22,699
I do.

962
00:41:22,734 --> 00:41:24,701
And that's why
you don't have to worry

963
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,703
about me hanging around
with Conrad anymore.

964
00:41:26,738 --> 00:41:30,040
From now on,
I am a one-writer girl.

965
00:41:30,074 --> 00:41:31,675
I do feel kinda bad.

966
00:41:31,709 --> 00:41:35,312
He is my mentee after all. He
really didn't do anything wrong.

967
00:41:35,346 --> 00:41:38,048
I wouldn't feel so bad.
(Laughter)

968
00:41:38,082 --> 00:41:40,050
And then he said,
"They used to do this to me

969
00:41:40,084 --> 00:41:42,986
for talking in class."
(Esposito, Ryan, and Conrad laugh)

970
00:41:43,021 --> 00:41:45,489
True story. Hey, since, uh,
we, uh, closed the case,

971
00:41:45,523 --> 00:41:48,158
uh, we figured we'd take Conrad
on a little field trip

972
00:41:48,192 --> 00:41:50,360
up to Rikers. 
Yeah, I have a pretty heavy prison scene

973
00:41:50,395 --> 00:41:52,529
in "Seriously Dead," and I want
to get all the facts right.

974
00:41:52,564 --> 00:41:55,065
Will you still send me
your writer's draft?

975
00:41:55,099 --> 00:41:57,801
Yes, as soon as I change the killer.
Girlfriend?

976
00:41:57,835 --> 00:42:00,237
Rookie mistake.

977
00:42:00,271 --> 00:42:03,040
It was nice to meet you, Alex.
You, too.

978
00:42:03,074 --> 00:42:05,075
(Ryan) Come on.

979
00:42:05,109 --> 00:42:08,478
So... a dude can be a muse,
right, bro?

980
00:42:08,513 --> 00:42:11,515
I mean, that's not weird
or anything, is it?

981
00:42:11,549 --> 00:42:14,084
No, it's not weird.
No. Mnh-mnh.

982
00:42:14,118 --> 00:42:16,420
Nah. Yeah.

983
00:42:16,454 --> 00:42:18,822
That's a little weird.

984
00:42:18,856 --> 00:42:20,524
Yeah. (Chuckles)

985
00:42:22,527 --> 00:42:24,895
Thank you.

986
00:42:24,929 --> 00:42:26,830
Always.

987
00:42:36,874 --> 00:42:38,775
Oh.

988
00:42:42,547 --> 00:42:45,449
