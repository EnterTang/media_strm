1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:02,362
Previously on Castle...

2
00:00:02,363 --> 00:00:03,313
Tell me what I don't know

3
00:00:03,314 --> 00:00:05,227
about my mom's murder, Detective Raglan.

4
00:00:05,228 --> 00:00:08,767
19 years ago, I... I made a bad mistake,

5
00:00:08,768 --> 00:00:11,130
and that started the dominoes falling,

6
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:12,687
and one of 'em was your mom.

7
00:00:13,846 --> 00:00:15,258
You woke the dragon,

8
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:18,135
and this is so much
bigger than you realize.

9
00:00:18,136 --> 00:00:20,709
We gotta find that shooter.
Our shooter is Hal Lockwood.

10
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:24,397
I need to know exactly
what you know about me

11
00:00:24,398 --> 00:00:25,963
and my employer.

12
00:00:30,673 --> 00:00:34,047
I will be back here week after week

13
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:36,116
to ask you who hired you.

14
00:00:38,242 --> 00:00:39,984
Hey, guys, I could use a hand.

15
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:42,848
Thank you. Thanks. That's very funny.

16
00:00:42,849 --> 00:00:45,707
Just for that, you will not be
getting an autographed copy

17
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,391
of my new graphic novel.

18
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:51,894
You wrote a graphic novel?
Not technically, but it is based on

19
00:00:51,895 --> 00:00:53,690
one of the greatest
characters I ever created.

20
00:00:53,691 --> 00:00:56,324
You see, Wolverine,
Batman, Betty, Veronica...

21
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,826
Sure, they were fine for their day.

22
00:00:59,008 --> 00:01:02,147
But there is a new sheriff
on the spinner rack,

23
00:01:02,148 --> 00:01:03,390
and his name is...

24
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:04,593
Derrick Storm.

25
00:01:04,594 --> 00:01:07,357
Advance art for "A Deadly Storm,"

26
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:09,305
the new graphic novel.
Wow.

27
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,753
It's pretty cool.
It's epic cool is what it is.

28
00:01:11,754 --> 00:01:12,934
Where's Beckett? I want to show her this.

29
00:01:12,935 --> 00:01:14,111
Making her weekly pilgrimage

30
00:01:14,112 --> 00:01:15,950
out to the prison to interview Lockwood.

31
00:01:17,095 --> 00:01:17,859
Oh.

32
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,161
Right.

33
00:01:36,457 --> 00:01:37,930
Thank you.
You're welcome.

34
00:01:38,718 --> 00:01:40,000
Welcome back, Detective Beckett.

35
00:01:40,001 --> 00:01:41,162
Officer Ryker.

36
00:01:41,271 --> 00:01:43,313
Our special today is serial arsonist.

37
00:01:43,856 --> 00:01:44,815
No, thank you.

38
00:01:44,816 --> 00:01:46,700
Perhaps I can interest
you in an armed robber

39
00:01:46,701 --> 00:01:48,712
covered in gang tats and
protesting his innocence?

40
00:01:48,713 --> 00:01:50,598
Uh, you know, I think I'll
just take the usual...

41
00:01:50,923 --> 00:01:53,219
Hal Lockwood.
That's an excellent choice, madam.

42
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,187
I'll have someone bring him down.
Thank you.

43
00:01:57,057 --> 00:01:59,970
It's Ryker.
I've got a visitor for Lockwood.

44
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:02,332
Ad-seg 3-4-6-1-7.

45
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:04,329
Yeah.

46
00:02:06,312 --> 00:02:07,641
What do you mean?

47
00:02:09,834 --> 00:02:12,392
Lockwood's no longer in
administrative segregation.

48
00:02:13,768 --> 00:02:16,282
Where is he?
He was transferred to general population

49
00:02:16,283 --> 00:02:18,330
about an hour ago.
What?

50
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,823
He was in ad-seg for a reason.

51
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:24,972
You gotta get him outta there. Now.
Why? What's the big deal?

52
00:02:24,973 --> 00:02:27,901
Lockwood! Lockwood! Lockwood!

53
00:02:28,558 --> 00:02:29,571
There is a prisoner

54
00:02:29,572 --> 00:02:31,816
in the general population...
Gary McCallister.

55
00:02:31,817 --> 00:02:34,912
Lockwood is going to kill him
the first chance he gets.

56
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,655
Lockwood! Lockwood!

57
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:40,808
Lockwood! Lockwood! Lockwood!

58
00:02:44,974 --> 00:02:47,646
You know, I was wondering when
he was gonna get around to me.

59
00:02:48,026 --> 00:02:49,911
It's okay if you want a minute.

60
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:53,549
Move! Move! Get out of the way!

61
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,023
Don't make a mess of it, okay?

62
00:03:12,028 --> 00:03:13,591
I never do.

63
00:03:37,237 --> 00:03:38,382
Go.

64
00:03:48,213 --> 00:03:50,738
How did he even get into
the general population?

65
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,131
Esposito's running it down now,

66
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:53,995
but I'm guessing it wasn't an accident.

67
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:56,692
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:57,378 --> 00:03:58,401
For what?

69
00:03:59,925 --> 00:04:03,346
Well, Lockwood kills Raglan,
then he shanks McCallister,

70
00:04:03,347 --> 00:04:04,426
both of them ex-cops

71
00:04:04,427 --> 00:04:05,841
who had something to do
with your mother's murder.

72
00:04:05,842 --> 00:04:07,669
He's cutting off all avenues
of your investigation.

73
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,491
Castle, he's not cutting them off.
He's giving me new ones.

74
00:04:11,324 --> 00:04:12,723
I've been going to that prison

75
00:04:12,724 --> 00:04:14,516
every week for the last four months

76
00:04:14,517 --> 00:04:16,294
to have a staring contest with the devil,

77
00:04:16,295 --> 00:04:17,806
and the devil just blinked.

78
00:04:18,774 --> 00:04:20,715
This is exactly what I've been looking for.

79
00:04:22,501 --> 00:04:24,343
Hey, Department of Corrections

80
00:04:24,344 --> 00:04:26,641
says the signature used on the
transfer order was forged.

81
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:28,804
And the only people with access
to those documents at the prison

82
00:04:28,805 --> 00:04:29,964
are correctional officers and

83
00:04:29,965 --> 00:04:33,004
authorized clerical staff.
Which means bribe or blackmail.

84
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,386
I want a full financial
workup of every employee

85
00:04:35,387 --> 00:04:37,116
in that prison, sworn and civilian.

86
00:04:37,117 --> 00:04:38,928
I want to know who was
late on their mortgage,

87
00:04:38,929 --> 00:04:40,941
who was behind on their child support.

88
00:04:40,942 --> 00:04:43,839
Somebody took a hell of a risk
cutting Lockwood this transfer,

89
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,918
and they had to have been pretty desperate.
You got it.

90
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,920
See? Now we got a trail.
So where are we going?

91
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:50,438
To Lockwood's arraignment.

92
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:52,347
I want to see if we can rattle his cage.

93
00:04:52,348 --> 00:04:54,150
Lockwood doesn't seem
like the rattling type.

94
00:04:54,151 --> 00:04:57,202
Not Lockwood. Whoever's holding his leash.

95
00:05:04,355 --> 00:05:06,387
First Raglan and now McCallister.

96
00:05:06,388 --> 00:05:08,813
What are you doing,
collecting the whole set?

97
00:05:09,394 --> 00:05:10,882
You're a real badass, Lockwood,

98
00:05:10,883 --> 00:05:12,710
shanking an old man in his bunk.

99
00:05:12,711 --> 00:05:14,844
I don't know what you
think you accomplished,

100
00:05:14,845 --> 00:05:16,792
but this doesn't change a thing.

101
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,471
You hear me?

102
00:05:18,888 --> 00:05:21,243
Whoever hired you...

103
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,555
He can't hide from me.

104
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,839
No, sweetheart.

105
00:05:26,338 --> 00:05:28,440
You got it ass backwards.

106
00:05:29,164 --> 00:05:31,203
You can't hide from him.

107
00:05:32,271 --> 00:05:33,388
Please take your seat, ma'am.

108
00:05:36,846 --> 00:05:38,129
All rise.

109
00:05:39,197 --> 00:05:40,568
The court's in session.

110
00:05:42,923 --> 00:05:44,289
Be seated.

111
00:05:46,936 --> 00:05:48,677
Matter number 27 on the list...

112
00:05:48,678 --> 00:05:50,183
The people of the state of New York

113
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:53,337
vs. John Doe, A.K.A. Harold Lockwood.

114
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:54,799
The matter is on for arraignment.

115
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,782
Counsel, for the record and
who you represent, please.

116
00:05:57,934 --> 00:06:00,878
Avery Zussman for Harold
Lockwood, your honor.

117
00:06:01,654 --> 00:06:02,295
On the matter of

118
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:04,488
the people of the state of New York...
What is it?

119
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,295
Indictment number 2-0-1-1-4-6-0,

120
00:06:07,296 --> 00:06:10,030
the charge is premeditated murder...
I don't know.

121
00:06:10,031 --> 00:06:11,821
With a special circumstances allegation.

122
00:06:11,822 --> 00:06:13,927
Mr. Lockwood, do you waive a formal reading

123
00:06:13,928 --> 00:06:16,227
of this indictment?
I do.

124
00:06:17,355 --> 00:06:19,232
They're wearing chrome collar pins.

125
00:06:20,732 --> 00:06:22,570
NYPD's are brass.

126
00:06:22,571 --> 00:06:23,981
And how do you plead?

127
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,754
Now.

128
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,295
Castle, down!

129
00:06:45,946 --> 00:06:46,998
Are you okay?!

130
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:48,675
Yeah, yeah.

131
00:06:54,764 --> 00:06:55,705
Where? Where?

132
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:56,541
Downstairs.

133
00:07:00,735 --> 00:07:02,834
Come on. Keep moving.
Come on. Let's go. Go.

134
00:07:39,812 --> 00:07:40,933
How's she doing?

135
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:43,304
Lockwood's in the wind.
Everything about her mom's case

136
00:07:43,305 --> 00:07:45,427
just went to hell in a handbasket.
How ya think?

137
00:07:49,006 --> 00:07:50,946
Where are we on Lockwood's
known associates?

138
00:07:50,947 --> 00:07:52,564
Courthouse security personnel were so used

139
00:07:52,565 --> 00:07:54,720
to seeing cops come and go,
nobody gave 'em a second look.

140
00:07:54,721 --> 00:07:56,401
He didn't care about anybody
seeing their faces.

141
00:07:56,402 --> 00:07:58,322
Did FBI run 'em through facial recognition?

142
00:07:58,323 --> 00:08:00,868
No hits. Guys are ghosts.
What about the chopper?

143
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:03,420
F.A.A. says that they flew below
the 1,000-foot radar ceiling.

144
00:08:03,421 --> 00:08:05,880
They had to know NYPD would have
helicopters searching for 'em,

145
00:08:05,881 --> 00:08:06,813
so they'd want to ditch their chopper

146
00:08:06,814 --> 00:08:08,503
as soon as they could.
We got locals on the ground

147
00:08:08,504 --> 00:08:11,028
checking every small airfield
in the Tristate area.

148
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:13,639
I got nothing so far.
Hey, Beckett. We got something.

149
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,791
Check your in-box.

150
00:08:18,512 --> 00:08:20,681
So phone calls from the
prison are recorded,

151
00:08:20,682 --> 00:08:22,630
and every inmate has to make collect calls.

152
00:08:22,631 --> 00:08:26,370
Apparently, Lockwood made weekly
calls to the same number,

153
00:08:26,371 --> 00:08:28,373
but week after week, the
person at the end of the call

154
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:30,400
refused to accept the charges,

155
00:08:30,401 --> 00:08:31,793
until four days ago.

156
00:08:31,794 --> 00:08:32,909
Okay, here it is.

157
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:36,612
How's the family? Same.
How are Charlie and Mike?

158
00:08:36,613 --> 00:08:37,884
Good.

159
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:41,018
Anything on the phone number?
Burner cell, untraceable.

160
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:42,456
All right, check known
associates named Charlie

161
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:44,088
or Mike.
They're not talking about people.

162
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:46,290
That's the phonetic
alphabet, military jargon.

163
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:49,268
"Charlie and Mike" means continue mission.

164
00:08:50,552 --> 00:08:53,126
Well, we know the mission
wasn't McCallister.

165
00:08:53,127 --> 00:08:55,666
He was just a means to escape.
They could've paid off anyone

166
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:57,760
in the general population
to kill McCallister, but it

167
00:08:57,761 --> 00:08:59,669
had to be Lockwood because
they needed to get him out.

168
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,828
Which means Lockwood was after somebody else.
Who's left?

169
00:09:03,795 --> 00:09:06,619
Me.
Lockwood could've killed you in the courtroom.

170
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,512
You're not a threat.
You don't know anything.

171
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,662
I think I know who he's after.

172
00:09:11,096 --> 00:09:13,109
We know that your mom was killed

173
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,844
because she was working to free a mobster

174
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,629
who was wrongfully convicted of the murder

175
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,893
of an undercover federal
officer...Bob Armen.

176
00:09:18,894 --> 00:09:21,305
We know that the real
killers were renegade cops

177
00:09:21,306 --> 00:09:23,132
who were practicing their
own form of street justice

178
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:25,983
by kidnapping mobsters for ransom.

179
00:09:25,984 --> 00:09:28,677
These guys were also working for somebody...

180
00:09:28,678 --> 00:09:31,371
Somebody big, somebody
who will stop at nothing

181
00:09:31,372 --> 00:09:33,023
to keep his identity a secret.

182
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:34,856
Which means there's still

183
00:09:34,857 --> 00:09:37,160
one loose thread out there.
The third cop.

184
00:09:37,398 --> 00:09:40,514
The man that Joe Pulgatti saw
in the alley with John Raglan

185
00:09:40,515 --> 00:09:42,856
and Gary McCallister the night
that Bob Armen was killed.

186
00:09:42,857 --> 00:09:44,800
Whoever this guy is, if he's still around,

187
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:46,742
he knows who's behind this whole thing.

188
00:09:46,743 --> 00:09:48,555
Which makes him Lockwood's next target.

189
00:09:48,599 --> 00:09:49,980
But we looked through the reports.

190
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:51,584
There's no mention of any third cop.

191
00:09:51,585 --> 00:09:52,959
Just because he's not mentioned in it

192
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,981
doesn't mean he wasn't there.
Excuse me.

193
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:59,039
Beckett. Put a detail on her.

194
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,644
She's not gonna like that.
You don't have to tell her.

195
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:04,862
If Lockwood's going after this
third cop, he's still in town.

196
00:10:04,863 --> 00:10:06,934
You both know what he's capable of.

197
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:09,805
If you get a chance to put
him down, do not hesitate.

198
00:10:09,806 --> 00:10:10,985
That son of a bitch doesn't need

199
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:12,921
to see the inside of another courtroom.

200
00:10:13,222 --> 00:10:15,540
You read me?
Loud and clear.

201
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,446
That was the Jersey State Police.

202
00:10:17,447 --> 00:10:18,937
They found the chopper.

203
00:10:23,704 --> 00:10:25,000
Yours?

204
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:26,111
Yeah.

205
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,466
That smell... is that, uh...

206
00:10:28,467 --> 00:10:30,350
Bleach in the cabin.
They were destroying D.N.A.

207
00:10:30,351 --> 00:10:31,720
Evidence.
Mechanic says

208
00:10:31,721 --> 00:10:33,401
the chopper must have
been stolen and returned

209
00:10:33,402 --> 00:10:34,728
before anyone knew it was missing.

210
00:10:34,729 --> 00:10:36,604
He says he wouldn't even have
known anybody had used it

211
00:10:36,605 --> 00:10:38,187
if it weren't for the bullet holes.

212
00:10:38,188 --> 00:10:39,511
Who does the helicopter belong to?

213
00:10:39,512 --> 00:10:41,489
Hedge fund manager from Upstate.
Where is he now?

214
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,193
Sailing in the Caribbean with his family.

215
00:10:43,194 --> 00:10:45,275
All right, check his
background and the mechanic's,

216
00:10:45,276 --> 00:10:47,357
and anybody else who works here.
Right.

217
00:10:49,598 --> 00:10:50,888
Why now?

218
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:53,301
Lockwood was in prison for months.

219
00:10:53,302 --> 00:10:56,940
Why would he make a move now?
Well, they had him transferred,

220
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:58,583
and then they broke him out of a courtroom.

221
00:10:58,584 --> 00:11:01,085
That takes time, planning, resources.

222
00:11:01,086 --> 00:11:02,978
What if it was something else?

223
00:11:04,026 --> 00:11:05,818
What if there's another reason?

224
00:11:05,973 --> 00:11:07,151
Like what?

225
00:11:10,865 --> 00:11:12,141
You know, um...

226
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,519
I think I saw a surveillance
camera outside the building.

227
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,531
We pull the surveillance,

228
00:11:17,532 --> 00:11:19,804
look for a vehicle, maybe get an A.P.B.

229
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:20,883
You okay?

230
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,121
Yeah.

231
00:11:34,592 --> 00:11:35,579
Beckett's mom?

232
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,370
Yeah.

233
00:11:37,436 --> 00:11:39,649
I can't imagine what it
must be like for her...

234
00:11:40,043 --> 00:11:42,428
Solving murders
and bringing closure to all those families,

235
00:11:42,429 --> 00:11:44,593
but never to herself.

236
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:46,724
It's easier in my books.

237
00:11:46,986 --> 00:11:50,404
The just are rewarded,
the wicked are punished.

238
00:11:50,672 --> 00:11:53,539
Unfortunately, real life isn't that easy.

239
00:11:59,816 --> 00:12:00,854
Can I help you?

240
00:12:00,855 --> 00:12:03,895
I hope so. I'm Jim Beckett, Kate's father.

241
00:12:06,002 --> 00:12:07,529
I feel like I already know you, Rick.

242
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,440
I've heard a lot of great things about you

243
00:12:09,441 --> 00:12:11,473
from Katie.
Really?

244
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,135
Really.

245
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,506
So... how's she holding up?

246
00:12:17,078 --> 00:12:18,876
Well, it's kind of tough to
tell with her, you know?

247
00:12:18,877 --> 00:12:20,104
She doesn't flinch.

248
00:12:20,277 --> 00:12:22,948
I know. She wouldn't accept a night-light

249
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:24,333
when she was a little girl.

250
00:12:24,531 --> 00:12:25,644
Not that she wasn't afraid of the dark,

251
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:28,073
but I think she just felt
it was a point of pride to,

252
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,473
you know, stare it down.

253
00:12:35,314 --> 00:12:38,459
This... man she's chasing.

254
00:12:40,189 --> 00:12:41,906
How dangerous is he?

255
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:44,869
He's a trained killer.

256
00:12:49,342 --> 00:12:50,944
What happens when she finds him?

257
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:55,932
I've already lost my wife over this.

258
00:12:57,978 --> 00:12:59,660
I've already lost...

259
00:13:02,896 --> 00:13:04,791
Now look, i... it took me years,

260
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:06,283
but I've made my peace with that.

261
00:13:06,447 --> 00:13:07,512
But Katie?

262
00:13:08,176 --> 00:13:10,859
She won't listen to me
and she won't back down.

263
00:13:10,903 --> 00:13:12,156
Not unless someone can convince her

264
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:14,948
that her life is worth more
than her mother's death.

265
00:13:19,126 --> 00:13:20,787
Look, she cares about you, Rick.

266
00:13:22,063 --> 00:13:23,752
And unless you're a lot
dumber than you look,

267
00:13:23,753 --> 00:13:25,301
I know you care about her.

268
00:13:27,338 --> 00:13:29,650
Don't let her throw her life away.

269
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,016
How'd you sleep?

270
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,705
I didn't.
Yeah. Me neither.

271
00:13:43,951 --> 00:13:45,027
Thank you.
Listen, I was wondering...

272
00:13:45,028 --> 00:13:47,063
So we ran financials on everyone
associated with the prison...

273
00:13:47,064 --> 00:13:48,551
guards, civilian employees,

274
00:13:48,552 --> 00:13:50,241
medical staff.
Found a guard named Ryker.

275
00:13:50,242 --> 00:13:52,746
He's underwater in his mortgage,
he maxed out his credit cards,

276
00:13:52,747 --> 00:13:56,049
and he was about to lose his condo.
Ryker? I know Ryker.

277
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,490
You only thought you knew Ryker.
The day before Lockwood

278
00:13:58,491 --> 00:13:59,979
was transferred to general population,

279
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,910
Ryker received a $50,000 wire transfer.

280
00:14:02,911 --> 00:14:05,458
And guess who didn't
show up for work today.

281
00:14:08,633 --> 00:14:10,185
NYPD! NYPD!

282
00:14:10,186 --> 00:14:13,446
NYPD! Do not move!
Show us your hands, Ryker!

283
00:14:13,447 --> 00:14:14,415
Let's go! Let me see your hands!

284
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,651
Let's see those hands!

285
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:18,469
Go.

286
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:33,758
The bullet entered through
the back of the head,

287
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:36,147
exited through the front,
and landed in the cabinet.

288
00:14:36,148 --> 00:14:37,200
I'm making the time of death

289
00:14:37,201 --> 00:14:40,748
around 9:00 last night.
Ryker made four phone calls

290
00:14:40,749 --> 00:14:42,960
to the same burner cell that
Lockwood called from prison.

291
00:14:42,961 --> 00:14:44,815
He was negotiating prices.

292
00:14:45,948 --> 00:14:48,743
Ryker had no idea who he was dealing with.

293
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,178
That was the D.O.J.

294
00:14:50,385 --> 00:14:52,049
The $50,000 wire transfer

295
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,720
bounced through the United Arab Emirates

296
00:14:53,721 --> 00:14:55,323
before it ended up in Ryker's account.

297
00:14:55,324 --> 00:14:57,410
It came from the Dubai
branch of a Swiss Bank.

298
00:14:57,411 --> 00:15:00,203
Who the hell are these guys?
Well, whoever they are,

299
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:02,793
they've been two steps ahead
of us this whole time.

300
00:15:02,794 --> 00:15:04,907
You don't go through this kind
of trouble to cover up a couple

301
00:15:04,908 --> 00:15:07,976
of rogue cops kidnapping
mobsters in some back alley.

302
00:15:07,977 --> 00:15:10,570
No, this is about something
else, something bigger.

303
00:15:10,571 --> 00:15:11,843
If we want to catch these sons of bitches,

304
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,753
we're gonna have to bring
the fight to them.

305
00:15:14,177 --> 00:15:15,561
Notify Ryker's next of kin.

306
00:15:15,562 --> 00:15:17,102
Let's talk to his neighbors again,

307
00:15:17,103 --> 00:15:19,102
anybody else that knew him at the prison.

308
00:15:19,522 --> 00:15:22,054
I want to see if he made
any new friends lately.

309
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:24,727
How long did you know
Ryker, officer Haskell?

310
00:15:24,728 --> 00:15:26,858
Since he came to the prison... almost, uh,

311
00:15:27,661 --> 00:15:28,955
almost ten years, I guess.

312
00:15:28,956 --> 00:15:31,153
Was he having trouble with
anyone at the prison?

313
00:15:31,369 --> 00:15:34,045
Ryker was stainless.
All the other corrections officers

314
00:15:34,046 --> 00:15:36,389
liked him, and even the
worst cons respected him,

315
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,533
'cause Ryker treated them with respect.

316
00:15:38,534 --> 00:15:41,681
Was there anyone new in his
life, maybe a girlfriend?

317
00:15:41,682 --> 00:15:43,398
Uh, no one.

318
00:15:44,524 --> 00:15:46,988
In fact, he'd been working
up the nerve for weeks

319
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:48,848
to ask you out, Detective.

320
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,070
Uh, did you know, uh, Ryker was
having financial problems?

321
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:55,521
No. He never said a word to me.

322
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:57,768
And I was probably closer
to him than anyone.

323
00:15:58,138 --> 00:16:00,111
We're getting the same thing
from everyone we talk to.

324
00:16:00,112 --> 00:16:01,648
Ryker was a stand-up guy.

325
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:03,631
None of his friends even knew
he had financial trouble.

326
00:16:03,632 --> 00:16:05,464
And other than calls to that burner phone,

327
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:06,539
there's nothing in his phone records

328
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,299
to indicate any new contacts in his life.

329
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,602
We just got word on the security
footage from the airport.

330
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:12,822
Cameras did pick up a
blue late-model Malibu

331
00:16:12,823 --> 00:16:15,869
leaving the area, but its
license plate was blacked out.

332
00:16:16,324 --> 00:16:18,748
So basically, we've got
nothing still, right?

333
00:16:18,749 --> 00:16:20,114
Just a bunch of dead ends.

334
00:16:20,115 --> 00:16:23,368
Everywhere I look, it's
just a bunch of dead ends.

335
00:16:23,532 --> 00:16:26,368
You know, whoever planned
this escape for Lockwood

336
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:28,493
knew they would need someone on the inside.

337
00:16:29,066 --> 00:16:30,513
If Ryker was such a straight arrow,

338
00:16:30,514 --> 00:16:31,808
why would they approach him?

339
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:33,849
He was a soft target because
of his financial troubles.

340
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,242
How would they know that?

341
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:37,943
They found him the same way we did...
financial records.

342
00:16:37,944 --> 00:16:40,409
They ran financials on
everybody in that prison.

343
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,548
Who would have that kind of authority?

344
00:16:41,549 --> 00:16:44,989
A cop or someone who was a cop.

345
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,905
So this third cop wasn't Lockwood's target.

346
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:50,635
This third cop was the one who
was holding Lockwood's leash.

347
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:52,706
He's the one who's behind this whole thing.

348
00:16:52,707 --> 00:16:54,846
Okay, I want us to pull reports

349
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,717
with Raglan and McCallister's name on it.

350
00:16:56,718 --> 00:16:57,718
We did all that already.

351
00:16:57,719 --> 00:16:58,730
Months ago. There's nothing.

352
00:16:58,731 --> 00:17:00,142
No, no, no, I'm not talking
about arrest reports.

353
00:17:00,143 --> 00:17:01,234
I'm talking about performance

354
00:17:01,235 --> 00:17:03,360
evaluations...
We went through everything.

355
00:17:03,361 --> 00:17:04,959
We looked at every cop we could find

356
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,109
who could've worked with them.

357
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,323
None of 'em are our third guy.
Well, then check it again.

358
00:17:08,324 --> 00:17:10,799
And when you're done with
that, check it again.

359
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,769
Beckett, we want him as bad as you.

360
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:16,672
The hell you do.
Nobody wants him as bad as I do, okay?

361
00:17:16,673 --> 00:17:19,565
Nobody. So check it again.

362
00:17:22,044 --> 00:17:23,028
Find anything?

363
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:24,652
Hell, I bet there wasn't even a third cop.

364
00:17:24,653 --> 00:17:28,313
I mean, seriously, Dubai,
paramilitary extraction...

365
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:31,512
How does a cop even begin to
mount an operation like this?

366
00:17:31,513 --> 00:17:33,967
These guys were kidnapping
mobsters for months,

367
00:17:33,968 --> 00:17:36,901
maybe even years before
things went sideways.

368
00:17:36,902 --> 00:17:38,625
They could've made millions in ransom.

369
00:17:38,626 --> 00:17:40,746
That would mean this third cop
would have plenty of cash

370
00:17:40,747 --> 00:17:43,247
to hire professionals like
Dick Coonan and Hal Lockwood

371
00:17:43,248 --> 00:17:44,498
to clean up his mess.

372
00:17:45,926 --> 00:17:47,156
Keep checking.

373
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,440
Sir.

374
00:17:50,732 --> 00:17:53,307
Uh... I know we're still
officially on duty, but...

375
00:17:53,308 --> 00:17:54,071
Authorized.

376
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:54,901
It's lunch.

377
00:17:56,751 --> 00:17:58,060
Nice work.

378
00:17:58,061 --> 00:17:59,785
Ooh, those are cold. Yeah.

379
00:17:59,786 --> 00:18:01,108
Those are really cold.

380
00:18:01,109 --> 00:18:03,494
Yeah, we keep 'em in evidence...
refrigerated storage.

381
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,962
Isn't that where you keep the...
Don't worry about it.

382
00:18:09,907 --> 00:18:11,177
How is she?

383
00:18:11,178 --> 00:18:13,155
She hasn't returned my calls.

384
00:18:13,156 --> 00:18:14,113
She just grabbed those case

385
00:18:14,114 --> 00:18:17,217
files and ran outta here.
She's getting lost.

386
00:18:17,218 --> 00:18:18,954
She's an inch away from the rabbit hole.

387
00:18:18,955 --> 00:18:21,557
She'll be fine. She always is.

388
00:18:21,995 --> 00:18:23,475
What if we come up empty?

389
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,302
Who's Napolitano?

390
00:18:26,303 --> 00:18:27,916
Oh, he worked with Raglan on a
couple of drug busts,

391
00:18:27,917 --> 00:18:29,036
but he was at his daughter's wedding

392
00:18:29,037 --> 00:18:30,418
the night Bob Armen was shot,

393
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:32,907
so he's not our third cop.
Where is he now?

394
00:18:32,908 --> 00:18:35,170
He died of heart failure back in 1993.

395
00:18:35,171 --> 00:18:37,993
Why are you asking about Napolitano?
Uh, he and Raglan are listed

396
00:18:37,994 --> 00:18:40,068
as the arresting officers on this report,

397
00:18:40,069 --> 00:18:42,539
but this has been altered.

398
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,495
What? How can you tell?

399
00:18:44,496 --> 00:18:46,180
Because I know typewriters.

400
00:18:48,018 --> 00:18:50,566
Older typewriters use cloth ribbon.

401
00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:53,171
If you look closely, you can see
the striations in the typeface.

402
00:18:53,172 --> 00:18:56,216
Newer typewriters used film ribbon.

403
00:18:56,217 --> 00:18:58,042
Somebody whited out...

404
00:18:58,043 --> 00:19:00,299
The assisting officer's
name on this report,

405
00:19:01,213 --> 00:19:03,641
photocopied it, and then
typed in Napolitano's name.

406
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,577
It's a cover-up, literally.

407
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:08,043
I'll be damned.
What are you doing?

408
00:19:08,044 --> 00:19:10,583
Well, documents have a way of
disappearing in this case.

409
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:15,358
This way, we all have it.
Let's show cap.

410
00:19:15,972 --> 00:19:16,997
Son of a bitch went through

411
00:19:16,998 --> 00:19:18,778
a lot of trouble to cover his tracks.

412
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:19,953
We found two other reports where

413
00:19:19,954 --> 00:19:22,569
Napolitano's name was added on.
We figure whoever did them

414
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,133
had to have done so after Armen's murder.

415
00:19:24,134 --> 00:19:25,513
But before we went digital.

416
00:19:25,514 --> 00:19:26,954
That's over ten years.
You're talking about

417
00:19:26,955 --> 00:19:27,820
thousands of officers walking in

418
00:19:27,821 --> 00:19:29,685
and out of the records room.
Yeah, but whoever took

419
00:19:29,686 --> 00:19:31,448
their name off those
reports would've had to go

420
00:19:31,449 --> 00:19:33,467
physically get them from the records room.

421
00:19:33,468 --> 00:19:34,289
Find out who was Manning

422
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,479
the records desk during that time.

423
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,312
- Maybe that someone remembers
looking the other way. - Right.

424
00:19:40,711 --> 00:19:41,877
What?

425
00:19:42,762 --> 00:19:44,093
Continue mission?

426
00:19:45,188 --> 00:19:47,054
If Lockwood isn't going
after the third cop,

427
00:19:47,055 --> 00:19:48,653
then who's the mission?

428
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,773
I put a protective detail
on her...plainclothes.

429
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:53,412
These guys are good.
Good enough to stop Lockwood?

430
00:19:54,623 --> 00:19:57,793
Look, she's not gonna stop, and
the next time he sees her,

431
00:19:57,794 --> 00:19:59,789
one of them is gonna die.

432
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,448
Take her off the case.

433
00:20:01,928 --> 00:20:03,926
Castle, did Beckett ever
tell you how we met?

434
00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:06,262
No.

435
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:09,348
I was working late one night
and went down to archives

436
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:11,643
to locate some old reports.

437
00:20:12,057 --> 00:20:14,349
And there she was, with a flashlight

438
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:16,593
and a bankers box open on her lap,

439
00:20:16,843 --> 00:20:18,745
studying this unsolved.

440
00:20:18,996 --> 00:20:20,020
She was a patrol cop then.

441
00:20:20,021 --> 00:20:22,042
She wasn't even authorized
to be down there.

442
00:20:22,043 --> 00:20:23,278
When I asked her what
the hell she was doing,

443
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:25,289
she told me, this was her mother's case

444
00:20:25,513 --> 00:20:27,496
and she'd found some
things that didn't add up.

445
00:20:27,842 --> 00:20:30,508
Now I could've written her up right then.
Why didn't you?

446
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:32,183
Because I knew it wouldn't stop her.

447
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,979
It was there in her eyes,
man, and I thought...

448
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:37,776
With this kid's tenacity and some training,

449
00:20:37,777 --> 00:20:39,633
I mean, she'd make a hell of a homicide.

450
00:20:39,987 --> 00:20:42,049
That tenacity is gonna get her killed.

451
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,705
I cannot...

452
00:20:44,363 --> 00:20:47,277
Make Beckett stand down, Castle.

453
00:20:47,452 --> 00:20:48,907
I never could,

454
00:20:48,908 --> 00:20:51,204
and the way I figure,
the only one who can...

455
00:20:52,026 --> 00:20:53,412
is you.

456
00:21:02,444 --> 00:21:03,516
Can I come in?

457
00:21:03,811 --> 00:21:04,572
Yeah.

458
00:21:05,535 --> 00:21:06,523
So we went over

459
00:21:06,524 --> 00:21:09,740
all of Raglan and McCallister's
old arrest records,

460
00:21:09,741 --> 00:21:10,987
and you were right.

461
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,599
There was a third cop that was with them

462
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,485
on a lot of those arrests.

463
00:21:13,486 --> 00:21:15,368
But then someone went
back into those reports

464
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:18,272
and removed their name, so Ryan
and Esposito are right now

465
00:21:18,273 --> 00:21:20,182
looking into who was running
the records room back then.

466
00:21:20,183 --> 00:21:21,428
Castle, you couldn't have just called me

467
00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:22,963
and told me this over the phone?

468
00:21:23,172 --> 00:21:25,978
Well, yeah, I... I thought that...

469
00:21:27,658 --> 00:21:30,044
Castle, if you got something
to say, just please say it.

470
00:21:32,845 --> 00:21:36,428
Beckett, everyone associated
with this case is dead.

471
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,380
Everyone.

472
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:40,290
First your mom and her colleagues,

473
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,638
then Raglan, then McCallister.

474
00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:43,688
You know they're coming for you next.

475
00:21:44,697 --> 00:21:47,319
Captain Montgomery's got a
protective detail on me.

476
00:21:47,611 --> 00:21:48,776
It wasn't that hard to spot.

477
00:21:48,777 --> 00:21:50,972
That's not gonna be enough
to stop Lockwood. You know that.

478
00:21:50,973 --> 00:21:52,266
Think about what they're up against...

479
00:21:52,267 --> 00:21:53,744
Professional killers?

480
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:57,536
I-I've been working with you
for three years. You know me.

481
00:21:57,537 --> 00:21:59,578
I am the guy who says we can
move that rubber tree plant.

482
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:00,350
But you know what, Beckett?

483
00:22:00,351 --> 00:22:01,503
I don't think we're gonna win this.

484
00:22:01,504 --> 00:22:05,223
Castle, they killed my mother.
What do you want me to do here?

485
00:22:06,165 --> 00:22:07,304
Walk away.

486
00:22:10,005 --> 00:22:11,814
They're gonna kill you, Kate.

487
00:22:13,064 --> 00:22:14,710
And if you don't care about that...

488
00:22:15,825 --> 00:22:17,409
At least think about how
that's gonna affect

489
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,202
the people that love you.

490
00:22:19,586 --> 00:22:21,909
You really want to put
your dad through that?

491
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:24,329
And what about Josh?
And what about you, Rick?

492
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:26,167
Well, of course I don't want
anything to happen to you.

493
00:22:26,168 --> 00:22:29,431
I'm your partner. I'm your friend.
Is that what we are?

494
00:22:31,526 --> 00:22:34,329
Oh, you know what?
I don't know what we are.

495
00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:36,412
We kiss and then we never talk about it.

496
00:22:36,413 --> 00:22:38,866
We nearly die frozen in each other's arms,

497
00:22:38,867 --> 00:22:40,123
but we never talk about it,

498
00:22:40,124 --> 00:22:42,505
so no, I got no clue what we are.

499
00:22:42,506 --> 00:22:44,331
I know I don't want to see
you throw your life away.

500
00:22:44,332 --> 00:22:46,901
Yeah, well, last time I
checked, it was my life,

501
00:22:46,902 --> 00:22:49,353
not your personal jungle gym.

502
00:22:49,642 --> 00:22:51,234
And for the past three years,

503
00:22:51,235 --> 00:22:54,736
I have been running around with
the school's funniest kid.

504
00:22:54,737 --> 00:22:56,165
And it's not funny enough.

505
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,979
You know what? This isn't about
your mother's case anymore.

506
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,214
This is about you needing a place to hide,

507
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,221
because you've been chasing
this thing so long,

508
00:23:02,222 --> 00:23:03,317
you're afraid to find out who

509
00:23:03,318 --> 00:23:06,296
you are without it.
You don't know me, Castle.

510
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,808
You think you do, but you don't.

511
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:11,112
I know you crawled inside
your mother's murder

512
00:23:11,113 --> 00:23:12,459
and didn't come out.

513
00:23:12,804 --> 00:23:14,163
I know you hide there

514
00:23:14,164 --> 00:23:15,924
the same way you hide in
these nowhere relationships

515
00:23:15,925 --> 00:23:17,987
with men you don't love.

516
00:23:18,743 --> 00:23:20,796
You could be happy, Kate.

517
00:23:21,694 --> 00:23:23,575
You deserve to be happy.

518
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:25,946
But you're afraid.

519
00:23:29,258 --> 00:23:30,306
You know what we are, Castle?

520
00:23:30,307 --> 00:23:31,824
We are over.

521
00:23:32,155 --> 00:23:33,578
Now get out.

522
00:23:55,845 --> 00:23:58,910
Oh, my God! What the hell's going on here?

523
00:23:58,911 --> 00:24:01,283
Nothing. I'm sorry. Go back to bed.

524
00:24:02,092 --> 00:24:03,212
There's only one person on the planet

525
00:24:03,213 --> 00:24:05,168
that can get you this pissed off.

526
00:24:07,036 --> 00:24:08,961
She's going to get herself killed.

527
00:24:08,962 --> 00:24:10,134
She's a grown woman.

528
00:24:10,135 --> 00:24:13,000
She's a homicide detective, for God sakes.

529
00:24:13,001 --> 00:24:14,632
It's her job. It's her life.

530
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:17,468
If anything happens to her...

531
00:24:19,966 --> 00:24:21,230
Go on.

532
00:24:22,734 --> 00:24:25,061
Oh, Richard, Richard.

533
00:24:25,062 --> 00:24:26,578
For a man who makes his living with words,

534
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:29,854
you sure have a hell of a time
finding them when it counts.

535
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:31,372
Darling...

536
00:24:31,945 --> 00:24:34,241
Let me give you a word
of advice, all right,

537
00:24:34,343 --> 00:24:37,075
from someone who's better than
halfway through the movie.

538
00:24:37,486 --> 00:24:41,286
Don't waste another minute of it.

539
00:24:41,936 --> 00:24:45,749
Roy, I am over it. I mean it.
I want him gone.

540
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:47,478
Okay. He's gone.

541
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:48,946
What?

542
00:24:49,143 --> 00:24:50,982
You want Castle gone?
He's gone.

543
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:54,392
W...I...what... what about the Mayor?

544
00:24:54,393 --> 00:24:55,597
This is my house, Kate.

545
00:24:55,598 --> 00:24:57,688
The Mayor doesn't call
the shots here. I do.

546
00:24:57,884 --> 00:24:59,340
You ought to know that by now.

547
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,250
But I-I th... I could've kicked
Castle to the curb years ago...

548
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,904
Anytime I wanted to.

549
00:25:05,512 --> 00:25:07,325
Only reason I kept him around this long

550
00:25:07,326 --> 00:25:09,139
was because I saw how good he was for you.

551
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:13,810
Kate...

552
00:25:14,832 --> 00:25:16,292
You're the best that I've ever trained,

553
00:25:16,293 --> 00:25:17,917
maybe the best I've ever seen.

554
00:25:18,332 --> 00:25:20,742
But you weren't having any
fun before he came along.

555
00:25:26,634 --> 00:25:28,247
We speak for the dead.

556
00:25:29,557 --> 00:25:30,848
That's the job.

557
00:25:31,513 --> 00:25:32,738
We are all they've got

558
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:35,439
once the wicked rob them of their voices.

559
00:25:36,199 --> 00:25:37,819
We owe them that.

560
00:25:39,131 --> 00:25:41,104
But we don't owe 'em our lives.

561
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:47,124
He said that we can't win this.

562
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:48,517
He's right.

563
00:25:49,487 --> 00:25:52,120
I've spent most of my life
walking behind this badge,

564
00:25:52,121 --> 00:25:53,885
and I can tell you this for a fact...

565
00:25:54,476 --> 00:25:56,122
There are no victories.

566
00:25:56,998 --> 00:25:58,482
There's only the battle.

567
00:25:58,483 --> 00:25:59,808
And the best that you could hope for

568
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:03,966
is that you find someplace
where you can make your stand.

569
00:26:04,332 --> 00:26:05,774
If this is your spot...

570
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,246
I will stand with you.

571
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,612
I really don't think a
badge is behind all this.

572
00:26:15,918 --> 00:26:18,017
No one on the job has this kind of juice.

573
00:26:18,018 --> 00:26:19,641
If he worked with McCallister and Raglan,

574
00:26:19,642 --> 00:26:21,756
he's probably long retired by now.

575
00:26:21,939 --> 00:26:24,384
I mean, he could be in private
security, politics, business.

576
00:26:24,385 --> 00:26:26,624
Man, I can't believe I
gotta call these guys.

577
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:28,230
You know how pension guys love to talk.

578
00:26:28,231 --> 00:26:29,623
I bet I'm gonna be on the phone for hours

579
00:26:29,624 --> 00:26:32,978
listening to stories about the glory days.
Hey, listen to this...

580
00:26:33,121 --> 00:26:34,398
Mike Yanavich, sergeant,

581
00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:37,172
assigned to the records
room from '02 to '05.

582
00:26:37,173 --> 00:26:39,209
It says he ran it right
up until he retired,

583
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,714
and Yanavich graduated from the academy

584
00:26:41,715 --> 00:26:43,609
in the same class as Gary McCallister

585
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:47,071
and John Raglan.
Well, maybe he's our third cop. Where is he?

586
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:51,658
Looks like Yanavich relocated to
Miami Beach after he retired.

587
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:53,074
Contact Miami-Dade P.D. in the morning.

588
00:26:53,075 --> 00:26:54,941
See if they can verify his address.

589
00:26:55,149 --> 00:26:57,313
We'll fly down to Miami
to get him if we have to.

590
00:27:07,298 --> 00:27:09,247
Hello, Roy.

591
00:27:11,785 --> 00:27:13,486
You're not that fast.

592
00:27:13,806 --> 00:27:15,877
Besides, they're all upstairs asleep,

593
00:27:15,878 --> 00:27:17,169
safe and sound.

594
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,045
And they're not on tonight's menu.

595
00:27:20,696 --> 00:27:24,186
But if you wake 'em up, well,
then I gotta order off the menu.

596
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:25,681
What do you want?

597
00:27:26,467 --> 00:27:28,537
He's very disappointed, Roy.

598
00:27:28,738 --> 00:27:29,856
We all are.

599
00:27:30,124 --> 00:27:32,345
I mean, d-did you not understand

600
00:27:32,346 --> 00:27:34,488
the conditions of the agreement?

601
00:27:35,078 --> 00:27:37,827
Beckett stays alive as long
as you keep her on a leash.

602
00:27:37,828 --> 00:27:40,165
That's the deal that you made with him.

603
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:42,546
But you're not holding up your end.

604
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:43,636
And that's unfortunate,

605
00:27:43,637 --> 00:27:45,687
because she really is a lovely girl.

606
00:27:47,403 --> 00:27:50,161
But now we've reached a... critical stage,

607
00:27:50,162 --> 00:27:53,004
and I have to cap the well.

608
00:27:53,966 --> 00:27:55,955
So here's the news...

609
00:27:56,344 --> 00:27:59,267
Tomorrow night, you're gonna
call off that protective detail

610
00:27:59,268 --> 00:28:00,723
that you have on her,

611
00:28:00,724 --> 00:28:01,690
and then you're gonna get her

612
00:28:01,691 --> 00:28:04,213
to meet you at the hangar
where we stashed the bird.

613
00:28:04,214 --> 00:28:07,650
I don't care how you do it,
just get her there,

614
00:28:07,651 --> 00:28:11,036
and we'll handle the rest.
Go to hell.

615
00:28:14,627 --> 00:28:16,683
Well, then you have a decision to make.

616
00:28:17,355 --> 00:28:18,893
You can have Beckett...

617
00:28:19,374 --> 00:28:21,482
Or you can have your family.

618
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,905
But you can't have both.

619
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:26,886
Look at it this way...

620
00:28:26,887 --> 00:28:28,742
If you and Raglan and McCallister

621
00:28:28,743 --> 00:28:31,504
hadn't sinned so spectacularly,

622
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,882
then God wouldn't have
sent a punishment like me.

623
00:28:40,394 --> 00:28:42,287
We're gonna be late.
Come on.

624
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,384
Where are my girls?

625
00:28:46,056 --> 00:28:47,370
Come and give your old man a kiss.

626
00:28:47,371 --> 00:28:48,826
Mwah. Look at you.

627
00:28:49,204 --> 00:28:51,514
Hey, get off that phone and give me a kiss.

628
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,547
You know, I'm so proud of both of you.

629
00:28:56,548 --> 00:28:57,256
Dad.

630
00:28:57,257 --> 00:28:59,095
Come on. In the car, you two.

631
00:28:59,096 --> 00:29:00,841
Come on. Let's go.
Bye, dad.

632
00:29:00,842 --> 00:29:02,190
Bye-bye.
Bye.

633
00:29:09,855 --> 00:29:11,120
What's that for?

634
00:29:11,714 --> 00:29:12,953
I love you.

635
00:29:15,077 --> 00:29:16,209
I know.

636
00:30:19,202 --> 00:30:20,450
That was Miami-Dade.

637
00:30:20,674 --> 00:30:22,558
Apparently Yanavich didn't care
too much for the sun and sand.

638
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,276
He was only there for a
year, and then he moved

639
00:30:24,277 --> 00:30:27,272
back to Brooklyn, bought
that cop bar out on Fulton.

640
00:30:27,922 --> 00:30:30,394
How does Yanavich afford a
bar on a cop's pension?

641
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:31,560
Why don't we ask him?

642
00:30:34,367 --> 00:30:35,830
We better handle this, bro.

643
00:30:36,195 --> 00:30:38,376
Let's see what we got before
we bring her in on this.

644
00:30:50,165 --> 00:30:52,201
Sir.
Beckett, I think we have a lead.

645
00:30:52,652 --> 00:30:53,621
What'd you find?

646
00:30:53,622 --> 00:30:55,783
Meet me at the hangar where
we found the stolen chopper,

647
00:30:55,784 --> 00:30:58,678
and I'll explain everything there.
Okay. I'm on my way.

648
00:31:07,377 --> 00:31:09,280
...Maybe in the Hall of Fame, who knows?

649
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:11,509
Mike Yanavich?
That's me.

650
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:14,649
Detective Esposito, and
this is Detective Ryan.

651
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:15,847
Can we talk to you for a minute?

652
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,547
Sure. Want a drink?

653
00:31:17,548 --> 00:31:19,642
You own this place?
Free and clear.

654
00:31:19,643 --> 00:31:22,192
How do you manage that on a cop's pension

655
00:31:22,193 --> 00:31:24,867
if you don't mind me asking?
You get shot on the job,

656
00:31:25,423 --> 00:31:28,234
start drawing a disability
pension after you retire.

657
00:31:28,235 --> 00:31:30,061
You worked the records
room at the 12th, right?

658
00:31:30,062 --> 00:31:31,956
Decade ago. So what?

659
00:31:31,957 --> 00:31:34,950
Some records went missing on your watch,

660
00:31:34,951 --> 00:31:36,223
and some got altered.

661
00:31:36,224 --> 00:31:37,907
Yeah, well, I don't doubt it.

662
00:31:37,908 --> 00:31:40,750
I mean, uh, it wasn't like it is today.

663
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:43,268
We didn't make a federal case
out of everything back then.

664
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:45,191
You graduated from the Police Academy

665
00:31:45,192 --> 00:31:47,429
with John Raglan and Gary McCallister.

666
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:51,690
Mm-hmm, and 40 other guys.
Listen, I read the papers.

667
00:31:51,691 --> 00:31:54,272
I know Raglan and McCallister road dirty,

668
00:31:54,273 --> 00:31:56,076
but I didn't have any part of it.

669
00:31:56,285 --> 00:31:59,740
I mean, I knew 'em to say
hi, talk some baseball,

670
00:31:59,741 --> 00:32:01,890
maybe bitch about the A.C.L.U.

671
00:32:01,891 --> 00:32:04,203
They used to drink here
before I bought the place.

672
00:32:04,204 --> 00:32:05,484
Do you know if Raglan or McCallister

673
00:32:05,485 --> 00:32:07,348
were tight with anybody else?

674
00:32:07,511 --> 00:32:10,924
Yeah. Some black kid used to
follow 'em around, a rookie.

675
00:32:11,856 --> 00:32:14,425
I got a picture of 'em somewhere up here.

676
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:19,695
Yeah. That's him.

677
00:32:20,683 --> 00:32:22,717
The hell was his name?

678
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:25,768
Ah. Montgomery.

679
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,394
Yeah, McCallister and
Raglan trained that kid.

680
00:32:28,766 --> 00:32:31,329
Montgomery said he didn't
know either of these guys.

681
00:32:32,892 --> 00:32:35,514
Hey! What the hell's the matter with you?

682
00:32:37,834 --> 00:32:38,713
Hey!

683
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,335
You know it's him.
Montgomery's our third cop.

684
00:32:44,336 --> 00:32:46,166
He's the one who altered those records.

685
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:49,901
How can you even say that?
How could you even think that?!

686
00:32:49,902 --> 00:32:51,736
Montgomery brought us in to Homicide.

687
00:32:51,737 --> 00:32:53,939
What do we got, a picture?!
Think about it.

688
00:32:54,645 --> 00:32:57,108
Why else did he want us
to take Lockwood out?

689
00:32:57,109 --> 00:32:59,378
Because Lockwood leads us to him.

690
00:33:00,302 --> 00:33:01,722
He's been lying to us.

691
00:33:02,078 --> 00:33:03,942
He's been lying to us the whole time.

692
00:33:05,854 --> 00:33:06,396
No.

693
00:33:06,728 --> 00:33:08,251
Hey! Get off me!

694
00:33:09,372 --> 00:33:10,288
Ah.

695
00:33:13,132 --> 00:33:14,129
Aah!

696
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,522
Go ahead! Go ahead!

697
00:33:26,252 --> 00:33:27,435
Beckett.

698
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:35,143
Captain?

699
00:33:38,337 --> 00:33:39,314
Captain?

700
00:33:39,467 --> 00:33:40,337
Over here.

701
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,595
Put the gun away, Roy.

702
00:34:19,221 --> 00:34:20,585
Kate, I'm not going to jail for this.

703
00:34:20,586 --> 00:34:22,322
I can't put my family through that.

704
00:34:24,153 --> 00:34:25,355
Why?

705
00:34:26,045 --> 00:34:28,008
I was a rookie when it happened, Kate.

706
00:34:31,034 --> 00:34:32,843
McCallister and Raglan were heroes to me.

707
00:34:32,844 --> 00:34:34,625
I believed in what we were doing.

708
00:34:35,871 --> 00:34:38,015
We were just gonna snatch
Pulgatti that night.

709
00:34:38,568 --> 00:34:40,776
Bob Armen wasn't even supposed to be there.

710
00:34:41,285 --> 00:34:44,539
Armen reached for my gun.
That's when I heard the shot.

711
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,401
I didn't even know it was
my gun that went off

712
00:34:46,402 --> 00:34:47,992
until Armen went down.

713
00:34:48,236 --> 00:34:50,292
Then McCallister pulled me into the van.

714
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:52,349
I remember him saying,

715
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,342
"It's okay, kid. It's not your fault.

716
00:34:54,985 --> 00:34:57,102
Happens in this town every day."

717
00:34:57,336 --> 00:34:59,356
McCallister and Raglan tried to drown it,

718
00:35:00,245 --> 00:35:01,664
but not me.

719
00:35:01,817 --> 00:35:03,554
I put it all into the job, Kate.

720
00:35:03,555 --> 00:35:06,181
I became the best cop I could be.

721
00:35:07,701 --> 00:35:10,179
And then when you walked into the 12th...

722
00:35:10,706 --> 00:35:12,705
I felt the hand of God.

723
00:35:13,481 --> 00:35:15,176
I knew he was giving me another chance,

724
00:35:15,177 --> 00:35:16,374
and I thought,

725
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:20,462
if I could protect you the way
I should've protected her...

726
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:24,057
Did you kill my mother?

727
00:35:24,058 --> 00:35:25,306
No, that was years later,

728
00:35:25,307 --> 00:35:28,251
but she died because of
what we did that night.

729
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:31,470
Then who killed her?
I don't know how,

730
00:35:31,471 --> 00:35:33,709
but somehow, he figured
out what we had done,

731
00:35:33,901 --> 00:35:35,012
and he could've turned us all in.

732
00:35:35,013 --> 00:35:37,259
Instead, he demanded the ransom money.

733
00:35:37,618 --> 00:35:39,555
He took that money to become what he is,

734
00:35:39,556 --> 00:35:42,344
and God forgive me, but that
may be my greatest sin.

735
00:35:42,345 --> 00:35:43,996
Give me a name.

736
00:35:45,273 --> 00:35:46,961
You owe me that, Roy.
No, Kate.

737
00:35:46,962 --> 00:35:48,897
I give you a name, I know you.
You'll run straight at him.

738
00:35:48,898 --> 00:35:50,450
I might as well shoot you where you stand.

739
00:35:50,451 --> 00:35:54,127
That's why you brought me
here, isn't it, to kill me?

740
00:35:54,381 --> 00:35:57,033
No, I brought you here to lure them.

741
00:35:57,868 --> 00:35:59,352
You baited them?

742
00:35:59,548 --> 00:36:01,197
And now they're coming.

743
00:36:01,434 --> 00:36:02,672
I need you to leave.

744
00:36:02,673 --> 00:36:04,676
They are coming to kill you,
and I'm not gonna let 'em.

745
00:36:04,677 --> 00:36:07,050
I'm gonna end this.
I'm not going anywhere, sir.

746
00:36:07,051 --> 00:36:10,520
Yes, you are.
Castle, get her outta here.

747
00:36:11,142 --> 00:36:12,985
Captain, I...
Don't argue. That's why I called you.

748
00:36:12,986 --> 00:36:15,135
Get her outta here. Now.
Captain, please.

749
00:36:15,136 --> 00:36:17,458
Just listen to me.
You don't have to do this.

750
00:36:17,459 --> 00:36:21,259
Kate... no, please.
No, sir...I forgive you.

751
00:36:21,655 --> 00:36:23,702
I forgive you.

752
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:25,720
This is my spot, Kate.

753
00:36:27,248 --> 00:36:29,967
This is where I stand.
No.

754
00:36:30,145 --> 00:36:32,582
Castle.
No, no, sir, please,

755
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:34,968
listen to me. You don't have to do this.

756
00:36:34,969 --> 00:36:37,648
Castle, get her outta here now!
You don't have to...

757
00:36:37,649 --> 00:36:39,131
Sir, please.
Kate. Kate.

758
00:36:39,132 --> 00:36:42,043
No.
God, Castle, let me go!

759
00:36:42,044 --> 00:36:43,057
No!

760
00:36:44,555 --> 00:36:47,458
Let me go. Please!

761
00:36:47,459 --> 00:36:48,719
No!

762
00:36:52,801 --> 00:36:55,110
Please. Please.

763
00:36:55,876 --> 00:36:58,115
Shh. Shh. Oh...

764
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:11,491
Shh. Shh. I'm sorry. Shh. Shh.

765
00:37:16,827 --> 00:37:18,075
Where is she, Roy?

766
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,251
You can't have her.

767
00:37:20,455 --> 00:37:23,827
I told you, it's her or your family.

768
00:37:28,165 --> 00:37:29,759
Don't be stupid.

769
00:37:31,937 --> 00:37:33,867
You can't hide her from us,

770
00:37:34,727 --> 00:37:35,815
from me.

771
00:37:35,974 --> 00:37:37,778
You got that ass backwards, boy.

772
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:39,536
You can't hide from me.

773
00:37:41,284 --> 00:37:42,114
Oh!

774
00:38:11,209 --> 00:38:13,401
And that was what, your last stand?

775
00:38:14,405 --> 00:38:16,182
That's just sad, Roy.

776
00:38:16,183 --> 00:38:18,160
I'm just gonna kill her anyway.

777
00:38:18,394 --> 00:38:19,329
No...

778
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,394
You're not...

779
00:38:21,846 --> 00:38:23,339
And he's not.

780
00:38:23,821 --> 00:38:25,683
I saw to that.

781
00:38:26,217 --> 00:38:27,911
You're done, Lockwood.

782
00:38:28,076 --> 00:38:29,477
We both are.

783
00:39:22,413 --> 00:39:23,491
No one...

784
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,379
No one outside of this immediate family

785
00:39:28,607 --> 00:39:31,594
ever needs to know about this.

786
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,814
As far as the world is concerned,

787
00:39:34,815 --> 00:39:36,796
Roy Montgomery died a hero.

788
00:39:40,308 --> 00:39:41,847
We owe it to him...

789
00:39:44,565 --> 00:39:45,985
All of us.

790
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:41,499
Roy Montgomery taught me

791
00:40:41,798 --> 00:40:44,253
what it meant to be a cop

792
00:40:47,603 --> 00:40:51,145
he taught me that we are
found by our choices

793
00:40:52,906 --> 00:40:55,382
that we are more than mistakes

794
00:40:58,249 --> 00:40:59,862
Captain Montgomery once said to me

795
00:40:59,863 --> 00:41:02,129
that for us, there is no victory.

796
00:41:02,819 --> 00:41:04,518
There are only battles.

797
00:41:05,905 --> 00:41:08,265
And in the end, the best you can hope for

798
00:41:08,685 --> 00:41:12,237
is to find a place to make your stand.

799
00:41:13,659 --> 00:41:15,128
And if you're very lucky...

800
00:41:16,198 --> 00:41:19,304
You find someone willing to stand with you.

801
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:28,517
Our captain would want us
to carry on the fight.

802
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:34,019
And even if there is no victory,

803
00:41:34,923 --> 00:41:36,642
he would want us to stand together.

804
00:41:37,321 --> 00:41:38,057
Kate!

805
00:41:40,839 --> 00:41:42,611
Down! Everybody, down!

806
00:41:42,612 --> 00:41:44,080
Where'd the shot come from?
Lanie, get down!

807
00:41:46,755 --> 00:41:47,776
No, no, no, Kate.

808
00:41:47,777 --> 00:41:49,673
Find that shooter!
Shh.

809
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:50,848
Kate, please.

810
00:41:51,334 --> 00:41:52,913
Stay with me, Kate.

811
00:41:53,357 --> 00:41:55,794
Don't leave me. Please.

812
00:41:56,608 --> 00:41:58,889
Stay with me, okay?

813
00:41:59,276 --> 00:42:00,864
Kate...

814
00:42:01,367 --> 00:42:02,701
I love you.

815
00:42:03,579 --> 00:42:05,905
I love you, Kate.

816
00:42:06,105 --> 00:42:16,305
