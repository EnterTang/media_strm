11
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,450
來點甜蜜的我不介意
I sure could go for something sweet.

12
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:22,870
你要吃點什么嗎
Do you want to grab a bite to eat?

13
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,040
我想要的甜蜜不是吃的
Actually, it's not food that I'm craving.

14
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:29,540
怎么了
What? Is it...

15
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,330
不不  沒什么 
No, no. It's nothing.

16
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,050
不  我恰好是"沒什么"專家
No, no. I happen to be an expert on nothing.

17
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,330
這個表情  可不是沒什么
And this. This is not nothing.

18
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,490
好吧
Okay. Fine.

19
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,850
-你知道你會說夢話對嗎  -嗯
- Do you know how you talk in your sleep sometimes? - Oh, yeah.

20
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,930
昨晚你說了個名字
Well, last night you said a name.

21
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,710
我猜不是你的名字
Oh... and not your name I'm assuming.

22
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,420
不是
No.

23
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,930
隨便說了個名字  別多想嘛
Well, I wouldn't read anything into one random utterance.

24
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,410
說了14遍
14 utterances.

25
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,670
名字是喬丹
And the name was Jordan.

26
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,190
你說了一遍又一遍
You said it over and over again.

27
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,610
喬丹是誰
Who's Jordan?

28
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,880
我不知道
I have no idea.

29
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,600
是女人嗎
Is it a woman?

30
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,730
不  沒什么
No, it's nothing.

31
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,000
卡塞爾  我知道"沒什么"
Castle, I know nothing.

32
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,650
"沒什么"是我親愛的朋友
Nothing is a dear friend of mine.

33
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,160
這個可不是"沒什么"
And this. This is not nothing.

34
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,030
是沒什么  而且
Yes, it is. Besides...

35
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,610
我大多數的話都毫無意義
Most of what I say is meaningless.

36
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,250
更何況是夢話呢
Why would it be any different when I'm asleep?

37
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,910
這事沒完
We're not done here.

38
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,160
得了  卡塞爾  喬丹是誰
Come on, castle. Who is Jordan?

39
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,680
我沒什么可隱瞞的  本來就沒什么可說的
I got nothing to hide. There's just nothing to tell.

40
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,430
那你怎么這么戒備
Then why are you being so defensive?

41
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,470
我沒有
I'm not.

42
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,960
好吧
Okay, fine.

43
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,880
那我等到你睡著好了
I'll just wait until you're asleep.

44
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,340
然后我再問你
And then I'll ask you.

45
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,800
你不能這樣做
You can't do that.

46
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,270
拜托  卡塞爾  你才說你沒什么可隱瞞的
Come on, Castle. You just said that you had nothing to hide.

47
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,780
在我睡著時審問我
Yeah, but interrogating me in my sleep?

48
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,100
你會用這么卑鄙的招數嗎
Would you stoop that low?

49
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,760
誰說我沒用過
Who says I haven't already?

50
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,220
早啊  蕾妮
Hey, Lanie.

51
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,320
哇  真是死在巧克力上啊
Wow. Talk about death by chocolate.

52
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,230
不關巧克力的事  卡塞爾
Don't blame it on the chocolate, castle.

53
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,640
死因是子彈
A bullet's what did him in.

54
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,490
那紅色的不是覆盆子醬嘍
So that red stuff's not raspberry sauce?

55
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,250
恐怕不是  子彈射出傷
Afraid not. Exit wound.

56
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,790
那么他是背后中槍然后跌進桶里
So he was shot in the back and then fell in the mixer?

57
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,520
看起來是的  但在那之前
Looks like, but before that,

58
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,530
他可能和兇手搏斗過
he may have struggled with his attacker.

59
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,600
米黃色纖維
Beige fibers--

60
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,150
在他的表帶上發現的
They were caught on his watchband.

61
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,690
鑒證組會拿去分析
C.S.U. will run an analysis.

62
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,150
被害人叫吉米·韋蘭  這家店的老板
Vic's name is Jimmy Whelan. He's the owner of the shop.

63
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,280
他沒有前科
He has no record...

64
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,990
從背景資料中也看不出誰可能是兇手
And nothing in his bio that points to who did this.

65
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,770
可以排除不滿意的顧客
You can rule out dissatisfied customers.

66
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,110
這些東西太好吃了
These things are insanely good.

67
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,040
你居然吃死人的紙杯蛋糕
You're eating a dead man's cupcake?

68
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,040
那邊有免費樣品
There was free samples.

69
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,480
死亡時間
Time of death?

70
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,910
11點半到12點
Between 11:30 and 12:00.

71
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,590
怎么看出來的
Based on what?

72
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,600
你一下子成了法醫嗎
All of a sudden, you're an M.E.?

73
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,920
你不是喜歡我扮醫生嗎
I thought you liked it when I played doctor.

74
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,060
這樣說的依據是
I, uh, based the time of death on what

75
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,330
死者助手的話
the vic's assistant told me.

76
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,510
就在那邊
Right over there.

77
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,280
托德   告訴我們發生了什么事
Okay, Todd, why don't you just run us through what happened?

78
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,550
吉米讓我11點半去送貨
Jimmy sent me on a delivery at 11:30--

79
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,230
送一打紅絲絨蛋糕到路口的美容院
A dozen red velvets to a beauty shop down the way.

80
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,870
我回來后發現
And when I came back...

81
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,550
吉米是個非常好的人
He's a super-nice guy-- Jimmy.

82
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,180
他認識的人中有沒有不這么想的
Well, is there anyone in his life who didn't feel that way?

83
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,150
我不清楚
I'm not sure.

84
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,090
我才在這里工作兩周
The truth is, this is only my second week here.

85
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,920
但我離開前他的表現很奇怪
But he was acting real strange right before I left.

86
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,080
怎么奇怪
Strange how?

87
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,620
店外有輛徘徊的車
This car... cruised by the shop,

88
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,730
開得很慢
kinda slow.

89
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,250
他變得緊張
He got all nervous.

90
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,870
那時他就讓我離開
That's when he sent me on my run,

91
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,270
好像是故意要支開我
like he wanted to get rid of me.

92
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,020
什么樣的車
What kind of car was it?

93
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,250
黑色的68年道奇突擊者
It was a black '68 charger r/t.

94
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,000
我比較懂大馬力車
I know my muscle cars.

95
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,140
看到司機了嗎
Did you see who was driving?

96
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,210
沒  我離開時  司機把車停到了街角
No, but whoever it was parked it around the corner as I was leaving.

97
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,400
我回來后  車開走了
When I got back, the car was gone,

98
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,510
吉米死了
And there was Jimmy.

99
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,300
我們需要那輛車的詳細描述
Well, we'll need a detailed description of that car.

100
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,130
看來吉米放了不少現金[面團]啊
Looks like Jimmy kept a lot of dough around here.

101
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,420
這里是西點店嘛
It is a bakery.

102
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,590
真好笑
Good one.

103
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,590
箱子是在他辦公室找到的
This briefcase was stashed in his office.

104
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,920
五萬現金
That's $50,000.

105
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,360
四塊錢一個蛋糕
Whoa. At $4 a pop,

106
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,680
得賣12500個
he would have to sell 12,500 cupcakes.

107
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,690
聽起來不太可能
That seems unlikely.

108
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,100
托德  你知道這筆錢嗎
Todd, what do you know about that money?

109
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,550
不知道  我發誓
Nothing. I swear.

110
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,380
但他對這個箱子非常緊張
But he's real paranoid about that case.

111
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,980
一周兩次  他會從保險柜里拿出來
Twice a week, he'd take it out of the safe

112
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,870
帶去斯坦頓島
and take it with him down to staten island.

113
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,010
-去做什么  -他說在那里有生意
- What for? - Just said he had business there.

114
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,640
顯然吉米做的不僅僅是紙杯蛋糕的生意
Well, obviously Jimmy was into more than just baking cupcakes.

115
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,630
調查市內所有
So let's look at all the owners

116
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,460
68年道奇突擊者車的車主
of '68 chargers in the metro area.

117
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,630
沒問題
You got it.

118
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,640
萊恩在哪里
Hey, where's Ryan?

119
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,600
對了
Oh, right.

120
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,540
和羅森伯格醫生約在20分鐘后
The appointment at dr. Rosenberg's office is in 20 minutes.

121
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,340
要15分鐘才能到
It's gonna take us at least 15 to get there,

122
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,860
我們應該出發了
So we should probably go, right?

123
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,100
這就是說你應該
Which means you should probably...

124
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,530
怎么了
Hey, what's the matter?

125
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,400
如果是我的問題呢
What if it's my fault?

126
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,880
如果結果是我有什么問題呢
What if it turns out that there's something wrong with me?

127
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,650
這不是任何人的錯  凱文
It's nobody's fault, Kev.

128
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,100
我們只是需要知道到底是怎么回事
We just need to know what's going on.

129
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,260
需要幫忙嗎
You want some help?

130
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:32,970
不錯
Nice.

131
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,290
烘焙大師吉米·韋蘭
So master baker Jimmy Whelan,

132
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,940
多年來售賣高熱量的美味烘焙食物
longtime purveyor of caloric yet delicious baked goods,

133
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,890
當地街區少年壘球隊的贊助人
sponsor of a local kids' softball team,

134
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,970
小生意圓桌會議的發起人
charter member of the small business roundtable--

135
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,700
但他怎么會有五萬現金
But what was he doing with 50 grand in cash,

136
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,420
還要秘密前往斯坦頓島
and why the secret trips to staten island?

137
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,910
聽起來有秘密的不止你一個人  卡塞爾
Sounds like you're not the only one keeping secrets, Castle.

138
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,390
我準備忽略這句話
I'm going to ignore that.

139
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,610
這很奇怪
That's peculiar.

140
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,090
這有什么好奇怪的
What's so peculiar about wanting to ignore--

141
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,100
不是  我是說這些采購單
No, no, no, I mean these purchase orders.

142
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,740
這里寫著吉米花了七萬多
They show that Jimmy spent over $70,000

143
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,060
買廚房設備
on kitchen equipment.

144
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,460
比如說六米多寬的小型冷庫
Like a 20-foot-wide walk-in freezer.

145
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,550
我好像沒見過那東西
I don't remember seeing that.

146
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,580
因為根本就沒有
That's because there wasn't one.

147
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,930
他廚房根本就放不下
It wouldn't even fit in his kitchen.

148
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,790
我查過那輛道奇車
Yo. So I ran '68 chargers.

149
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,960
城里只有幾輛這款車  不過聽好了
There's only a handful of them on the road, but get this.

150
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,270
其中有一輛在羅伯特·S·珊農名下
One of 'em is registered to a Robert S. Shannon,

151
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,460
也就是鮑比·S
A.K.A. Bobby S.

152
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,420
他是斯塔頓島愛爾蘭黑幫的首腦
He's a shot caller for the Irish mob over in Staten Island.

153
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,130
也是個心狠手辣的王八蛋
He's a ruthless son of a bitch, too--

154
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,330
販毒  襲擊他人
drug trafficking, assaults.

155
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:25,050
他是斯塔頓島內一半兇殺案的嫌疑人
He's suspected of half a dozen murders over in Staten Island.

156
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,850
等一下  偷偷去斯塔頓島
Wait a minute. Secret trips to Staten Island,

157
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:27,900
和那么多的錢
all that cash...

158
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,210
如果這個蛋糕店是黑幫洗錢的地方呢
What if the cupcake shop is actually a mob front?

159
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,190
蛋糕師吉米·韋蘭
Jimmy Whelan the baker

160
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,090
其實是洗錢師吉米·韋蘭
is actually Jimmy Whelan the money launderer.

161
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,980
鮑比·S可能跟他鬧了別扭
Bobby S. could've had a falling out with him,

162
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,890
所以就把他弄死了
could've whacked him.

163
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,370
也許吧  但我們需要更多的證據
Maybe, but we're gonna need more

164
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,740
不能因為他的車出現在犯罪現場
than just his car at the crime scene

165
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,980
就把他和謀殺連在一起
to connect him to that murder.

166
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,860
也許有人能幫我們
Well, I may have somebody who can help us out with that.

167
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,120
我找出了他的通話記錄
I pulled Jimmy's phone records.

168
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,140
過去三天里  他接到了無數個電話
In the last three days, he received numerous calls

169
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,190
都是一個女人打來的  叫塞...
from a woman named, um... Sibhan...

170
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,270
塞
Siob--

171
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,230
塞博  賽博
Siob--Sib--

172
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,380
-雪芳  -雪芳
- Siobhan. - Siobhan?

173
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,680
愛爾蘭人這點很"出名"
Yeah, the Irish are notorious

174
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,980
喜歡取讀不出來的名字
for spelling names in wild and unpronounceable ways.

175
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,110
我不知道你是怎么念出
I don't even see how you get that from--

176
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,190
我也不知道
You're not alone.

177
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,190
雪芳·奧多
Anyway, Siobhan O'Doul,

178
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,980
她在斯塔頓島開了間酒吧
she runs a bar over in Staten Island.

179
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,820
根據有組織犯罪科記錄顯示
And according to Organized Crime,

180
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,540
那是鮑比·S做生意的地方
it's a place where Bobby S. does a lot of his business.

181
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,460
酒吧是雪芳開的吧
Does Siobhan happen to own that bar?

182
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,820
是的
She does, yeah.

183
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,120
謝謝你能來  奧多女士
Thank you for coming in, Ms. O'Doul.

184
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,100
愿為紐約警察貢獻微薄之力
Anything for New York's finest.

185
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,860
尤其是考慮到
Yeah, especially considering that

186
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,620
像妨礙司法這樣的重罪指控
a felony charge like obstruction

187
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,600
會讓你丟掉酒水販賣許可證
would cost you your liquor license.

188
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,750
你想要什么
What do you want?

189
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,540
我需要從你這了解吉米·韋蘭的情況
I need some answers about Jimmy Whelan.

190
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,330
沒聽過這個人
Never heard of him.

191
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,500
這可有意思了  因為過去三天里
That's funny considering you made seven phone calls

192
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,930
你給他打了七通電話
to him over the last three days.

193
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,510
蛋糕店的吉米
Oh, Jimmy the baker.

194
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,730
我想訂一些紙杯蛋糕
Yeah, I-I'm thinking of ordering some cupcakes.

195
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,870
你沒機會了  他被殺了
Yeah, well, you missed your chance. He was killed.

196
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,200
什么時候
When?

197
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,280
今天的早些時候
Earlier today.

198
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,640
你知道什么情況嗎
Do you know anything about it?

199
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,970
不知道  我怎么會知道
No. Why would I?

200
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,660
我們認為一個經常去你酒吧的人
Well, we think that someone that

201
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,360
和這個案子有聯系
frequents your bar was involved.

202
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,160
關于鮑比·S你知道什么
What can you tell me about Bobby S.?

203
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,250
我不會再多說一個字
I'm not saying another word.

204
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,530
把我的手機給我  我現在就要打電話
Give me my phone call. I want my phone call now.

205
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,650

00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,600
抱歉遲到了
Sorry I'm late.

在那啥里那啥
You know, do the thing in the thing

210
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,340
再把那啥給醫生
and give the thing to the doctor?

211
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,680
挺順利的
Yeah. Uh, it went... fine.

212
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,660
你的小泳將們游得快嗎
So are your swimmers swimming?

213
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,910
還不知道呢
Um, I don't know yet.

214
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,890
有案子啊
Hey, caught a case.

215
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,090
是的是的  有個案子

00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,820
女士  不能扇警察的耳光
Oh, lady, you can't slap a cop.

229
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,300

245
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,430

00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,120
拜托

247
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,580
咱們的萊恩有沒有可能

248
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,570
干出這么狗血的出軌事件呢
is involved in something scandalous and tawdry?

249
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,800
萊恩  不可能  他干不出來
Ryan? No way. He doesn't have it in him.

250

但是你沒看到
Yeah, but did you see the way

251
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,680
雪芳給他狠狠地一吻嗎
Siobhan gave him that flying lip lock?

252

他們  看  珍妮生氣了
They--ooh. Look, Jenny's pissed.

253
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,310
這很正常
Yeah, well, it's not surprising

254
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,770
當你發現你的另一半也藏著秘密的時候
when you find out someone you're in a relationship with

255
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,670
你也會生氣
is keeping a secret.

257

淡定  他出來了
Be cool. Here he comes.

258
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,690
自然點  自然點
Act normal. Act normal.

259
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,320
很自然啊
I am. This is normal.

260
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,680
該死
Damn.

261
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,940
鮑比·S
Bobby S.

262
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,790
你們覺得是他
Are we thinking that this guy

263
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,980
除掉了吉米·韋蘭嗎
is the one that took out Jimmy Whelan?

264
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,920
等下  你認識鮑比·S
Wait. You know Bobby S.?

265
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,800
我們以前是朋友
Yeah, we were friends back in the day.

266
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,770
你和這種混蛋是朋友  怎么回事
You were friends with this lowlife? How's that?

267
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,330
我們以前在一個幫派里
We used to run in the same crew.

268
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,130
進兇案組之前
I was undercover for 14 months

269
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,660
我做過14個月的臥底
before I joined homicide.

270
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,060
你在斯塔頓島做過臥底
You were undercover on Staten Island?

271
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,240
在愛爾蘭黑幫
With the Irish mob?

272
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,450
是  關于鮑比·S我們還知道什么
Yeah. So what do we got on Bobby S.?

273
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,390
等等  等等
No. Hold on. Hold on.

274
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,910
繼續前幾句話
Just go back for a second, please.

275
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:36,150
你在那里臥底
You were undercover?

276
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,080
在那和雪芳...
That's where you and Siobhan used to--

277
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,520
這件事很復雜
It's complicated.

278
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,740
我就喜歡復雜
I love complicated.

279
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,220
雪芳和這件案子有什么關系
How is Siobhan connected to all this?

280
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,370
她認識死者
She knows the vic.

281
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,200
顯然還認識鮑比·S
And she knows Bobby S., obviously.

282
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,810
但她不肯開口合作
But she's not talking.

283
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,440
或許她會愿意告訴我
Maybe she'll talk to me.

284
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,540
我猜你的真名不是費頓·奧康納咯
So I guess it's not Fenton O'Connell.

285
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,290
是凱文  凱文·萊恩
It's Kevin. Kevin Ryan.

286
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,740
至少你是愛爾蘭裔
Well, at least you're Irish.

287
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,730
關于這一點你沒有撒謊
You didn't lie about that.

288
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,980
很多事我都撒謊了
I lied about a lot of things.

289
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,770
他們說你躲起來了
They said you went into hiding.

290
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:22,350
七年來杳無音信
Seven years without a word.

291
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,120
是啊  我知道
Yeah, I know.

292
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,540
你什么都不知道
You do not know.

293
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,080
相信我  我也不想走的
Believe me, I didn't want to go.

294
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,220
省省吧
Spare me.

295
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,820
你甚至都沒種當面告訴我
You didn't even have the guts to tell me to my face.

296
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,920
只在梳妝臺上留了一張紙條
Just a note on the dresser.

297
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,180
雪芳  我知道你很生氣
Siobhan, I know you're angry.

298
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,040
但如果你陷入了麻煩
But if you're in trouble,

299
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,380
如果你知道鮑比·S跟兇案有關
if you know something about Bobby S. killing this guy,

300
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,360
告訴我
tell me.

301
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,590
讓我幫你
Let me help you.

302
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,730
你去死吧
You can go straight to hell,

303
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,080
臭條子
Cop.

304
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,480
做臥底
Deep cover?

305
00:10:58,610 --> 00:10:59,840
他居然沒告訴過我
I can't believe he didn't tell me.

306
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,640
埃斯波  他甚至都沒告訴珍妮
Espo, he didn't even tell Jenny.

307
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,690
但我是他的好兄弟  她只是妻子罷了
Yeah, but I'm his best friend. She's just the wife.

308
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,690
就是因為這種思想  你才一直打光棍
Thus proving why there is no Mrs. Esposito.

309
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:09,300
那是因為很難找到配得上我的女人
Hey, it's hard to find a woman for this much man.

310
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,690
談得怎么樣
So how'd it go?

311
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:13,870
沒成功
It didn't.

312
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,150
那么
So, uh,

313
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,210
我們推測鮑比殺這家伙的動機是什么
what do we think Bobby's motive was for killing this guy?

314
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,110
我們不知道
We don't know.

315
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,260
但似乎他們為了什么事鬧掰了
But it seems like the two of them had a falling out of some sort.

316
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,980
是啊  可以這么說
Yeah, you could put it that way.

317
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,610
請問你是哪位
And you are?

318
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,740
聯調局特別探員薩姆·沃克
Special agent Sam Walker, FBI.

319
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,660
我是貝克特探長
I'm detective Beckett.

320
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,550
這是萊恩和埃斯波西托警探
This is detective Ryan and Esposito.

321
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,450
萊恩  凱文·萊恩
Ryan? Kevin Ryan?

322
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,500
-你聽說過他  -當然了
- You've heard of him? - Yeah, of course.

323
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,490
這家伙帶著竊聽器潛入愛爾蘭黑幫團伙
This man got inside the Irish mob with a wire

324
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,750
其他人都做不到
when no one else could.

325
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,040
你幫我們抓獲了斯坦頓島上一半的幫派成員
You helped put away half the crew in Staten Island.

326
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,930
只可惜野火燒不盡啊
Too bad the weeds grew back, huh?

327
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,200
他們向來如此
They always do.

328
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,030
聯調局為什么對我們的兇案調查感興趣
So what's the FBI's interest in our murder investigation?

329
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,220
你們的被害人吉米·韋蘭
Your victim--Jimmy Whelan.

330
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,920
他是我的線人
He was my informant.

331
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,520
吉米本來安分地經營著小店
Jimmy was just running his shop,

332
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,520
勉強度日
trying to get by,

333
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,320
但后來經濟嚴重滑坡
but then when the economy turned,

334
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,410
他借了一大筆錢
he borrowed some hard money,

335
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,280
那之后  鮑比·S就控制住他了
And after that, Bobby S. owned him.

336
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,750
那么吉米在向你報告鮑比的生意往來嗎
So Jimmy was feeding you intel on Bobby's operations.

337
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,500
不僅如此
No, more than that.

338
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,330
他本來要幫助我們得到那本幫派"圣經"的
He was gonna help us get the crew's bible.

339
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,400
那本"圣經"
The bible?

340
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,320
我想你們說的一定不是那本圣書吧
I'm guessing we're not talking about the holy book.

341
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,300
不  是幫派成員的叫法
No, it was just something the crew called it.

342
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,720
是一份記載了多年交易和聯絡人的清單
It's a list of transactions and contacts going back years.

343
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,250
拿到那本圣經  就可以扳倒整個犯罪團伙
You get that bible, you'll take down the whole crew.

344
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,160
現在吉米死了  你又得從頭開始了
So now that Jimmy's gone, you're back to square one.

345
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,550
差不多吧  不過我們還有雪芳
Pretty much, though we still have Siobhan.

346
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,220
不好意思   我沒聽明白
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

347
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,540
她也是我的線人
She's my informant, too.

348
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,940
什么  雪芳是不會告密的
What? Siobhan wouldn't snitch.

349
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,310
過去的雪芳或許不會
Maybe not the old Siobhan.

350
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,810
但事實上  你走后
But the truth is, once you left,

351
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,220
她很難過
she fell on hard times.

352
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,730
幫派成員都在她的酒吧喝酒
The crew drinks at her bar.

353
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,520
他們跟她聊天  信任她
They talk to her. They trust her.

354
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,720
鮑比·S甚至在她地下室設了一個辦公室
Bobby S. even keeps an office in the basement.

355
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,450
她想掙脫出來時  我們提出了一項交易
So when she wanted out, we made an offer.

356
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,780
什么交易  證人保護計劃嗎
For what, witness protection?

357
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,750
是的  前提是她幫我們扳倒黑幫
Yeah, if she helps us bring down the crew.

358
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,380
她的出路就是幫我們拿到那本"圣經"
Helping us get the bible, that was gonna be her ticket.

359
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:45,450
直到鮑比發現吉米是個內奸
Well, until Bobby S. figured out that Jimmy was a rat

360
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,610
并且將他殺害了
and had him killed.

361
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,970
她打電話給吉米就是為這事嗎  提醒他
So that's why she called Jimmy, to warn him?

362
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:49,790
是的
Yeah.

363
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,680
吉米自認為能說通鮑比
Jimmy thought he could talk his way out of it.

364
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,370
但顯然  他失敗了
Of course, he couldn't.

365
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,340
雪芳現在要怎么辦
So what happens to Siobhan now?

366
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,160
她必須回去
She goes back in.

367
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,750
不行
She can't.

368
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,930
現在不行
Not now. I--

369
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,240
那太危險了
It's too dangerous.

370
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,600
她很清楚要面臨的風險
She knows the risks.

371
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,800
沃克探員  如果我們能發現她和吉米的聯系
Agent Walker, if we linked her to Jimmy,

372
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,260
那鮑比·S也能發現
Then Bobby S. can, too.

373
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,950
聽著  雪芳可以選擇抽身
Look, Siobhan is free to walk away.

374
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,140
去哪呢
And go where?

375
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,330
誰都別想輕易擺脫鮑比·S
You don't just walk away from Bobby S.

376
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,780
大家都知道那一點  他一定不會放過她的
Everybody knows that. He's gonna hunt her down.

377
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,880
你必須把她加入證人保護計劃
You have to put her in witness protection.

378
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,640
拿到"圣經"后當然可以
Yeah, for the bible, sure.

379
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,610
但證人保護計劃不是什么福利項目
But witness protection isn't some entitlement program.

380
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,370
雪芳必須自己爭取
Siobhan has to earn it.

381
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,710
失陪了
Excuse me.

382
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,110
我需要立刻和她見面
I need to meet with her now.

383
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,700
聯調局的人要置她的生死于不顧
The feds are hanging her out to dry.

384
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,380
鮑比一旦發現  肯定會殺了她的
And when Bobby finds out, he'll kill her for sure.

385
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,450
聽著  雪芳
Look, Siobhan,

386
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,040
現在最重要的是不要慌張
The main thing is not to panic.

387
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,720
千萬別做任何可能引起懷疑的事
You don't want to do anything that might arouse suspicion.

388
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,830
低調一段時間  你會沒事的
Just keep your head down for a while. You'll be fine.

389
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:45,790
不
No.

390
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,340
你會死的
You'll be dead.

391
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,750
瞧瞧你  終于說實話了
Look at you, telling the truth.

392
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,350
那條子說得對  我現在死定了
The cop is right. I'm screwed six ways to sunday here.

393
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,900
鮑比·S把"圣經"放在哪
Where does Bobby S. keep the bible?

394
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,400
在他臥室的保險箱里
In his bedroom safe.

395
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,560
吉米原打算怎么拿到手
How was Jimmy gonna get it?

396
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,050
每周四  鮑比·S會找大伙去賭桌球
Every Thursday, Bobby S. has the guys over to bet on pool.

397
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,620
吉米本該在那時候下手
Jimmy was supposed to do it then.

398
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,050
密碼是多少
What about the combination?

399
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,970
鮑比每周五都會改密碼
Bobby changes it every Friday.

400
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,860
但我知道他的規律
But I know the system he uses.

401
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:07,800
吉米之所以能拿到圣經 
And Jimmy could get the bible

402
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,120
是因為他是幫派成員
because he was one of the crew,

403
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,000
可以進入鮑比·S的房子
and he has access to Bobby S's house.

404
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,760
現在我們在內部沒有人了
And now we got no one inside.

405
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,710
我去
I'll go in.

406
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,190
我去拿那本"圣經"
I'll get the bible.

407
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,380
真的嗎
Really?

408
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,170
你  怎么做
You? How?

409
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,490
你知道我當年跟鮑比·S關系很鐵
You know how close I was to Bobby S. Back then.

410
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,390
我作為費頓·奧康納的身份并沒有暴露
My Fenton O'connell cover is still good.

411
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,150
警探  那是七年前的事了
Detective, that was seven years ago.

412
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,040
幫派成員只知道
As far as the crew knows,

413
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,580
聯調局找上門時我跑了
I bolted when the feds swooped in.

414
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,940
你們還起訴了費頓·奧唐納  對吧
You guys even filed indictments against Fenton O'connell, right?

415
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:32,600
對
Yeah.

416
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,670
那本圣經我們找了多久了
How long has law enforcement been after that bible,

417
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,110
15年  20年
15, 20 years, huh?

418
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,020
這些家伙是毒瘤
These guys are drug-dealing parasites.

419
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,810
什么時候再有機會把他們一網打盡
When are you gonna get another shot to wipe 'em all out?

420
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,070
聽著  你想要那本圣經
Look, you want the bible,

421
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,400
我們想緝拿兇手鮑比·S
we want Bobby S. for murder,

422
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,030
雪芳想繼續活著
Siobhan wants to keep breathing.

423
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,560
人人獲利
Everybody wins.

424
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,860
我可以做到
I can do this.

425
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,760
我去請示一下上級
Let me run this by my A.S.A.C.

426
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,680
你干什么
What are you doing?

427
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,110
你瘋了嗎
Are you out of your mind?

428
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,750
我當過費頓  我可以重扮一次
I was Fenton. I can be him again.

429
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,460
別為了我丟了性命
Don't get yourself killed on my account.

430
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,140
好吧  你恨我
Okay. Yeah, you hate me.

431
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,060
我知道  我活該
I get that, and I deserve it.

432
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,200
你想得到證人保護嗎
But do you want to be put in witness relocation or not?

433
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,650
想不想
Yes or no?

434
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,090
警探
Detective...

435
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,540
你剛剛說的是認真的嗎
Were you serious about that offer?

436
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,650
你已經很久沒參與行動了  警探
You've been out of it a long time, detective.

437
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,380
組織發生了變化
There's a new hierarchy,

438
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,440
你必須盡快爭取他們的信任
and you're going to have to win them over, fast.

439
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,060
你已經七年沒扮費頓了
Seven years since you were Fenton--

440
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,580
太久了
That's a lifetime.

441
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,840
光扮演還不夠
It's not enough to act like him.

442
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,640
你必須成為這個人
You must become him.

443
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,010
我就是費頓·奧康納
I am Fenton O'connell.

444
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,490
如果你說服不了他們
If you're not convincing,

445
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:05,910
必死無疑
you're dead.

446
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,980
我就是費頓·奧康納
I am Fenton O'connel.

447
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,980
我就是費頓·奧康納
I am Fenton O'connel.

448
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,160
我不喜歡這樣  兄弟
I don't like this, bro.

449
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,770
你沒戴竊聽器  也沒帶定位器
You don't have a wire, no locator.

450
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,500
如果我戴這些  鮑比·S會發現的
If I did, Bobby S. would find 'em.

451
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,050
只能這樣  伙計
This is the way it's gotta be, man.

452
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,290
那兩個給你擔保的沃克探員的線人
What's the name of Agent Walker's informants

453
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,450
叫什么名字
who will vouch for you?

454
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,200
梅森兄弟  馬特和托尼
The Mason brothers, Matt and Tony.

455
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:45,290
最近一次在哪蹲的監獄
Where'd you do your last stretch?

456
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,760
埃爾邁拉  殺了一個人
Elmira for man one.

457
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,200
我還能告訴你我的手機號
I can even tell you my cell number.

458
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,590
我心里有數  好嗎
I know what I'm doing, okay?

459
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,590
雪芳呢
What about Siobhan?

460
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,110
我們的計劃沒問題
Our plan is solid.

461
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,630
我能行
I got this.

462
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,010
那回頭見  搭檔
See you on the other side, partner.

463
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:41,140
怎么  就這么歡迎我嗎
What, this is the welcome I get, huh?

464
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,080
你們這些愛爾蘭混蛋都不想我嗎
None of you Irish bastards missed me, huh?

465
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,260
費頓
Fenton?

466
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,630
費頓·奧康納
Fenton O'connell?

467
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,070
雪芳
Hey, Siobhan.

468
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,250
也很高興見到你  瑪吉
Nice to see you, too, Maggie.

469
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,630
你還想要什么  列隊歡迎嗎
What'd you expect, a parade?

470
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,310
不想想你對雪芳干的混蛋事
After what you did to Siobhan?

471
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,910
你只能打一拳
Unh-unh. One shot's all you get.

472
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,960
放開那位女士
Hey, take your hands off the lady.

473
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,580
只要她別礙著我
Long as she keeps her hands off of me.

474
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,810
七年了  費頓
Seven years, Fenton?

475
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:18,980
你到底去哪里了
Where the hell have you been?

476
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,530
聽著  你生氣  我懂
Look, you're pissed. I get it.

477
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,240
可這事我們私下解決  好嗎
But we'll work all this... out, maybe a little less publicly.

478
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,690
不過我得先找鮑比·S聊聊
But first I need to talk to Bobby S.

479
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,560
原來你回來是找鮑比的
Oh, that's why you came back, for Bobby?

480
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,680
讓我談好正事
Let me handle my business,

481
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,590
然后我把時間都給你
and then I'll have nothing but time for you.

482
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,620
你可真有魅力
Ah, you are such a charmer.

483
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,100
可如果你要找的是鮑比·S
But if it's Bobby S. you're after,

484
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,920
就得先和他的二把手談
you're gonna have to go through his number two.

485
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,740
是嗎  誰呢
Yeah? Who might that be?

486
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,200
我丈夫
My husband...

487
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,790
連姆
Liam.

488
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,080
跟你說  他不是我認識的萊恩了
I'm telling you, man. He's not the Ryan I know.

489
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,140
我說的不僅是他的發型和著裝
And I'm not just talking about the haircut and the clothes.

490
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:52,960
他像是變了個人
It's like he's a different dude.

491
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,690
他就該是那樣子
That's what he's supposed to be.

492
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,580
他進入角色了  他是費頓  那很好
He's in character. He's Fenton. That's good.

493
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,640
如果他還不夠好呢
Yeah, but what if he's not good enough?

494
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,290
時隔七年  難免有所生疏
After seven years, he's gotta be rusty.

495
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,020
這些斯坦頓島的家伙可不是吃素的
And these Staten Island boys are no joke.

496
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,760
兩位  幫萊恩最好的方式
You guys, the best way to help Ryan

497
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,170
是給鮑比·S定罪
is by building a case against Bobby S.

498
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,130
可能比我們設想的棘手
That might be trickier than we thought.

499
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,150
鮑比·S的68款突擊者有張電子付費通行卡
Bobby S's '68 Charger has an electronic E-Z Pass,

500
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,040
而且記錄顯示
and records show

501
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,740
突擊者開車去揚克斯
the Charger drove to Yonkers

502
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,270
在上午十點通過喬治·華盛頓橋
via the George Washington Bridge around 10:00 A.M.

503
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,910
下午兩點后才回程
It didn't make the return trip till after 2:00 P.M.

504
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,720
吉米在11點半到12點間遇害
Jimmy was killed between 11:30 and 12:00.

505
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:19,960
這幫鮑比洗清了嫌疑
That puts Bobby in the clear.

506
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,000
怎么可能
How is that possible?

507
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,150
托德在面包店門口看到的那輛車
The car that Todd saw outside of the bakery

508
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,540
一定是鮑比·S的
had to have been Bobby S's.

509
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,900
或許他想辦法讓電子付費通行卡失效了
Maybe he somehow disabled his E-Z Pass,

510
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,740
制造出他往返揚克斯的假象
making it appear as though all he did was go to and from Yonkers.

511
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,880
即便是這樣  我們怎么證明呢
Okay, yeah, but how do we prove that?

512
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,780
我們查清他在揚克斯期間的去處
We figure out where he went when he was in Yonkers.

513
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:33,840
然后找證據
And then we find evidence

514
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,860
證明他在死亡時間區離開過那里
that he left during our time-of-death window.

515
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,380
他想制造不在場證明  我們就拆穿他
He's trying to build an alibi, and we're gonna tear it down.

516
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,410
把你手機給我
Give me your phone.

517
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:44,320
為什么
Why?

518
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,800
鮑比·S向來信不過電子設備
Bobby S. has an abiding distrust of electronic devices.

519
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,990
把你手機給我
Give me your phone.

520
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,770
這不是讓人家生誤會嗎
Whoa. Whoa. What'll the missus think, huh?

521
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,610
鮑比
Hey, Bobby.

522
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,850
我認識你嗎
Do I know you?

523
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,860
搞什么  是我  費頓
What the hell? It's me Fenton.

524
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:20,690
我記得多年前認識個費頓·奧唐納
I recall knowing a Fenton O'connell years ago.

525
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,100
他待我情同手足
He was like a brother to me.

526
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,660
非常仗義的家伙
Real stand-up guy...

527
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,610
直到他跑路了
Till he cut and ran.

528
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,210
別這樣  鮑比
Come on, Bobby.

529
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,180
我被出賣了  你知道的
I got ratted out. You know that.

530
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,260
我要留下來
Me hanging around

531
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,140
只會給大家都惹麻煩
woulda just brought more heat down on everyone.

532
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,670
所以你就人間蒸發了
So you made yourself scarce.

533
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:40,150
實際上  這七年里沒人有你的音訊
In fact, no one's heard from you in... seven years.

534
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,620
你去哪里了
Where you been?

535
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,550
西部
Out west.

536
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:43,650
四處干了點小打小鬧
Been making some moves here and there

537
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,810
直到過了訴訟時效
until the statute of limitations ran out.

538
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,160
老實說  鮑比
Tell you the truth, Bobby,

539
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,960
我要是手里沒有好貨
I didn't want to come home till I had something

540
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,160
都不好意思回來
to bring to the table.

541
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,240
朋友
Well, friend...

542
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:53,790
拿出來吧
Here's the table.

543
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,690
我聽說聯調局抓走了本·吉迪恩
I heard the feds took down Ben Gideon,

544
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,440
你可能需要一些貨源
so you might be in need of some product.

545
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,980
我一直和梅森兄弟在芝加哥外奔波
I been working with the Mason brothers out of Chicago.

546
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,050
我聽說過他們
I've heard of 'em.

547
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,690
這是穩定的貨源  質量也不錯
It's a stable source, quality stuff.

548
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,540
我可以幫你弄到一切你想要的
I can get you whatever you need.

549
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,700
我在擴展銷路  鮑比
This is me stepping up, Bobby.

550
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,420
那又怎樣
So what...

551
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,610
你就是歌里唱到的漂泊者
You're the wild rover from the song?

552
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:20,480
"滿載著黃金而歸"  是這個吧
"Returning with gold in great store," is that it?

553
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,650
要么你就是奸細
Or are you a rat?

554
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,120
你知道我不是這種人
You know me better than that.

555
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:26,810
這個嘛
Well...

556
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:29,890
該說的我都說了  我不會求你的  鮑比
I said my piece, but I'm not gonna beg, Bobby.

557
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,010
看你的了  好嗎
It's up to you, okay?

558
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,800
是的  沒錯
Oh, yeah, it is.

559
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,360
那么
So...

560
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,880
我是應該歡迎浪子回家呢
Should I welcome home the prodigal son,

561
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,060
還是讓連姆把子彈
or should I have Liam put a bullet

562
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,550
射進你的后腦
in the back of your head?

563
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,880
等著你下令呢  鮑比
Oh, just say the word, Bobby.

564
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,850
你要是覺得我是奸細
You think I'm some kind of rat,

565
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,160
一個不正直的人
that I'm a man without honor?

566
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,500
那就動手吧
Then you pull the trigger.

567
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,270
要是你懷疑我  鮑比
You doubt me, Bobby,

568
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,570
那你就親自動手吧
you do it yourself.

569
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,370
費頓回來了
Fenton's back.

570
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,440
歡迎回家
Welcome home.

571
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,900
還在這呢
Still here.

572
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,690
要喝點什么
What can I get you?

573
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,140
一品脫黑啤酒
A pint of the black stuff.

574
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,960
請大家舉杯
Glasses in the air.

575
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,490
盧克 15:32
Luke 15:32.

576
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,070
這算哪門子祝酒詞啊
What the hell kind of a toast is that?

577
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,060
你在哪找到這傻帽的  鮑比
Where'd you find this heathen, Bobby?

578
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,530
他在主日學校讀過書嗎
Didn't he ever go to sunday school?

579
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,730
我在這歡喜地慶祝
"We should celebrate and rejoice

580
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:42,650
是因為
because..."

581
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,570
因為你在這的弟兄
"Because your brother here was dead

582
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,540
死而復生了
and has come to life."

583
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,000
歡迎回家
Welcome home.

584
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,690
-為了費頓  -費頓
- To Fenton. - Fenton.

585
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,680
一切安好
Slainte.

586
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,190
你怎么看他的
What do you think of him?

587
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,660
我怎么看無所謂  要看鮑比·S
Doesn't matter what I think. It's up to Bobby S.

588
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,780
是啊  可你相信他說的
Yeah, but do you buy his story

589
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,690
這七年他都在哪的故事嗎
about where he's been for the last seven years?

590
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,240
我不知道  但我會去調查的
I don't know, but I'm gonna check it out.

591
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,690
要是他說謊了呢
And if he's lying about somethin'?

592
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,380
那我就殺了這個混蛋
Then I'll kill the bastard.

593
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:25,570
我想我知道鮑比·S去了揚克斯什么地方
So I think I figured out where Bobby S went in Yonkers.

594
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,550
去了跑馬場
The Raceway.

595
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,520
他在那里的取款機取了500美元
He pulled out $500 in cash from the A.T.M. there.

596
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,790
去賭馬了
Betting on the ponies.

597
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,180
停車場里有監控嗎
Any security cameras in the parking lot?

598
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,710
埃斯波正在查  要是我們能證明
Espo's checking right now, but if we can prove

599
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,950
他恰好在案發時間離開
that he left just before our time-of-death window,

600
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:39,730
那就幫我們給他定罪了
then that should help us nail him for the murder.

601
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,200
不用了  謝謝  我很好
Oh, no. Thank you. I'm fine.

602
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,210
我們有萊恩的消息嗎
So do we know how Ryan's doing?

603
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,390
沒有  我討厭有事情發生我卻不知道
I don't know, and I hate not knowing things.

604
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:51,870
好吧  聽著
Okay, look. Uh...

605
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,120
喬丹不是女的  行了嗎
Jordan is not a woman, all right?

606
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,280
那他是誰啊  或者是什么啊
Then who is it? Or rather, what is it?

607
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,370
這重要嗎
Why does it matter?

608
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,190
因為  卡塞爾  對你很重要
Because, Castle, it matters to you.

609
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,010
你就不能告訴我嗎
Why won't you tell me?

610
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:07,050
蕾妮確定吉米·韋蘭身上纖維的來源了
Lanie's identified the fibers on Jimmy Whelan.

611
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,080
是澳大利亞的羊毛制品
They are... wool from an Australian sheep.

612
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,510
也許鮑比有幫手
Ah, perhaps Bobby's had an accomplice--

613
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,390
一只冷血兇惡的綿羊
a cold-blooded, murderous sheep.

614
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,100
-就是這個  -真的假的
- That's it. - Seriously?

615
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,490
不是那個  看這個
No, not that. This. Look.

616
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,140
看他穿的外套
Look at the jacket he's wearing.

617
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,690
是皮革的
It's leather shearling...

618
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,540
上面有羊毛
with wool.

619
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,890
-這就和謀殺案聯系起來了  -別急
- That ties him to the murder. - Not so fast.

620
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,700
跑道的貴賓停車區區
There were no cameras in the V.I.P. parking area

621
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,740
沒有監控
of the racetrack.

622
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,870
但那天是鮑比·S的幸運日
But it turns out Bobby S had a lucky day.

623
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:32,980
40比1的概率他都贏了  賺了一萬四
His 40-to-1 long shot won. Netted him 14 grand.

624
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,870
他穿著同一件外套
And wearing the same coat.

625
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:35,510
問題是
The problem is,

626
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,460
他填交稅表格的時間
he's filling out his w-2g tax forms

627
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,830
與吉米被殺的時間一致
at the exact same time that Jimmy got whacked.

628
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,140
那鮑比就不可能是兇手了
Then Bobby can't be our killer.

629
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,120
他是被陷害的
So he was being set up.

630
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:45,010
有人借了鮑比·S的車  留下那些纖維
Someone borrowed Bobby S's car, planed those fibers,

631
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,020
這就是為了讓他當替罪羊
All in an effort to make him look like the killer.

632
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,470
要是有人陷害鮑比
If someone's trying to set Bobby up,

633
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:49,690
萊恩就必須知道這一點
Ryan needs to know.

634
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:05,290
你知道這么見面很危險
You know... it's risky meeting like this.

635
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,810
最好是有重要的事
It better be important.

636
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:08,690
吉米不是鮑比殺的
Bobby didn't kill Jimmy.

637
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,690
真正的兇手偷了他的車然后陷害他
The real killer stole his car and set him up.

638
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,860
或者是鮑比命令別人做的
Or Bobby ordered the hit

639
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,330
把車借給了兇手
And loaned his car to the killer.

640
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,010
不是的  老兄
No, bro.

641
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,410
現場的證據是特意留下的
Forensic evidence was purposefully left behind.

642
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,740
這是陷害
It's a frame.

643
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,190
很可能就是他幫派里的人
Probably someone in his own crew.

644
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,880
好的  我會留心的
Okay. I'll keep my eyes open.

645
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,720
這對你有什么好處啊
What good is that gonna do you, hmm?

646
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,340
一旦那邊發生了什么事  我不在你身邊
What good is that gonna do you when something goes down,

647
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,480
這對你有什么好處啊
I'm not there to back you up?

648
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,150
你要做的就是放任不管
What you need to do is walk away.

649
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,550
等完事了我再離開
I'll walk away when I'm done.

650
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,410
你想什么呢
What's wrong with you?

651
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:33,200
你根本輸不起 哥們  你有珍妮 
You got a lot to lose, man. You got Jenny.

652
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:33,980
你還準備要個孩子
You're trying to start a family.

653
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,100
用不著你告訴我這有多危險
I don't need you to tell me what's at stake here.

654
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,230
聽著
Look, man...

655
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,600
鮑比邀請我今晚和他去打臺球
I got invite to Bobby's pool game tonight.

656
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,680
就等這個呢
This is it.

657
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,620
這是我拿到圣經的機會
This is my shot at getting that bible.

658
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,700
這不值得啊  伙計
It's not worth it, man.

659
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,780
到手了我就給你打電話
I'll call you when I get it.

660
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,040
鮑比怎么可能不是兇手
How could bobby is not be the killer?

661
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,710
我聽他親口說覺得吉米是奸細
I heard him say he thought jimmy was a rat.

662
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,060
肯定別人也聽到了
Someone else must've heard that, too.

663
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:57,970
幫派里的人嗎
Someone in the crew?

664
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,090
肯定是這樣  對吧
It has to be, right?

665
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,010
這太糟了  你今晚不能去打臺球了
This is bad. You can't go to the pool game tonight.

666
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,960
我必須去
I have to go.

667
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,580
我不會再有別的機會了
I won't get another chance.

668
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,350
這也是你唯一的機會
You won't get another chance.

669
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:10,170
鮑比保險箱的密碼是多少
What's the combination to Bobby's safe?

670
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,510
304217
3-0-4-2-1-7.

671
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,040
304217  你怎么知道的
3-0-4-2-1-7. How do you know that?

672
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,050
周五晚上鮑比會叫我打電話給他
Bobby has me ring up a total on the cash register

673
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:18,800
告訴他收銀機里錢的總數
on friday nights.

674
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,770
他用總款數當做密碼
He bases the combination on that total.

675
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,890
我們會順利度過這一關的
We're gonna get through this.

676
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,620
不是吧  你還留著這個小家伙
Oh, come on. You still have this little guy?

677
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,870
等等  它叫什么名字來著
Wait. Um, what his name again?

678
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,990
你怎么能忘了胡子先生呢
How could you forget Mr. Whiskers?

679
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,290
你花了50刀才幫我贏回了他
You spent over 50 bucks trying to win him for me.

680
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,870
那個套圈游戲太坑爹了
That ring toss was a bitch.

681
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,960
但他物有所值
Well, it was worth every penny.

682
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,910
他陪伴我度過了不少難關
He's seen me through some pretty rough times.

683
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,000
我們的過去沒有一點是真的嗎
Was any of it real?

684
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,250
我對你的感情是真的
What I felt was.

685
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,660
我得走了
I gotta go.

686
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,940
今晚至關重要
Big night tonight.

687
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,120
在揚克斯跑馬場的調查
So the canvass at Yonkers raceway

688
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,290
有了新發現
came up with something.

689
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,560
泊車員見過鮑比·S的黑色道奇車
A parking attendant saw Bobby S's black charger.

690
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,950
車子在案發半小時后返回
Now it returned 30 minutes after the murder.

691
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,540
他只是遠遠地看到了  但他說
He only saw it from a distance, but he says the driver

692
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,660
司機帶著一頂棒球帽
Was wearing a baseball cap,

693
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,050
隨后他步行去了地鐵站
and he walked to the subway stop.

694
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,620
聯系一下紐約交管局
Okay, let's touch base with the M.T.A.

695
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,190
聯系過了
Already did.

696
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,910
我參照了那段時間里所有消費過的地鐵卡
I cross-referenced all metrocards swiped at that time.

697
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:32,970
有一張是用信用卡購買的
One of them was bought with a credit card,

698
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:34,980
信用卡的主人是連姆·芬奇
and that credit card belonged to Liam Finch.

699
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,470
他是鮑比·S的二把手
That's Bobby S's number two.

700
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:37,420
這是一場陰謀
It's a coup.

701
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,440
連姆設計陷害鮑比來上位
Liam is framing Bobby to get him out of the way.

702
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,460
他想要掌權
He wants to take over.

703
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,230
而萊恩正好插手了這件事
And Ryan walked right in the middle of it.

704
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,430
不止如此  他不僅插手了
Worse. He didn't walk in the middle.

705
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,090
而且以鮑比·S朋友的身份攪局
He walked in as Bobby S's friend.

706
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,470
他自然成為了連姆的敵人
That makes him Liam's enemy.

707
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:47,720
我們得提醒他
Okay, we have to warn him.

708
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,680
如果我們打給他  他的身份就暴露了
If we call him, we could blow his cover.

709
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,140
如果不打電話  他會被殺的
If we don't, he could end up dead.

710
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,200
不是吧你
Get the hell outta here.

711
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,350
你的臺球什么時候打得這么好了
Since when'd you become such a pool hustler?

712
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,810
請叫我"快桿艾迪"
Just call me Fast Eddie.

713
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,620
過來
Come here.

714
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,350
我看了你的報價  我能接受
I went over your numbers. I can live with 'em.

715
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,860
你多久能把貨從芝加哥運過來
So how soon can you get some of that Chicago crank up here?

716
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,000
到這周末  我能弄到五磅
I can get you 5 pounds by this weekend.

717
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:19,930
下周的話
Come next week,

718
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:21,470
你想要多少  我就有多少
I can get you however much you want.

719
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,260
棒極了
Love it.

720
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:25,970
到你了  走狗屎運的混蛋
Take your shot, you lucky bastard.

721
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,630
基恩的電話  說有急事
It's Keane. Says it's urgent.

722
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,110
基恩  怎么了
Yeah, Keane.

723
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,360
連姆  你說得對
Liam, you were right.

724
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,520
有奸細
We got a rat in the house.

725
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,280
待會兒打給你
I'll call you back.

726
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,250
他說我們之中有奸細
He said we got a rat in the house.

727
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,390
好啦  我要去上廁所
All right, I gotta hit the head.

728
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,840
叫史迪威把車開到前門
Tell Stevie to bring my car around front.

729
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:11,950
體育干將  我正找你呢
Hey,sport. Been looking for you.

730
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:14,750
鮑比·S叫我們開車兜兜風
Bobby S needs us to take a ride.

731
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:16,190
好的  我去拿下手機
Okay. Let me get my phone.

732
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,110
你用不上手機
You're not gonna be needing it.

733
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:21,210
車子就在外面  你負責開車
Car's out back. You're driving.

734
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,660
好吧  我去去就來
All right. I'll be right back.

735
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,900
該走了  費頓
Time to go... Fenton.

736
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,640
萊恩還是不接電話
Ryan's still not answering.

737
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,700
如果鮑比·S不讓人用手機
Well,if Bobby S doesn't allow cell phones in his presence,

738
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,190
那他可能還在和萊恩打臺球
maybe he and Ryan are still just playing pool.

739
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,190
沃克特工說了什么
What did Agent Walker say?

740
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:57,630
聯邦政府也不清楚萊恩在哪兒
The Feds don't know any more than we do about where Ryan is.

741
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,090
事情不太對勁
Something's not right.

742
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:04,100
凱文遇到危險了嗎
Guys... Is Kevin in trouble?

743
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,130
沒有
Uh, no.

744
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,030
我們只是在討論些辦案程序上的事
We're just talking some procedural stuff.

745
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:09,590
別騙我了  哈維  到底怎么了
Don't lie to me, Javi. What's going on?

746
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,810
我丈夫呢
Where's my husband?

747
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,770
珍妮  我們邊喝咖啡邊聊吧
Jenny, maybe we should go get a coffee.

748
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,540
那么你們不知道他在哪兒
So you don't know where he is?

749
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:25,010
是的  但是我們會找到他的
No. But we are going to find him.

750
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:28,890
我們認為他并沒有遇到什么大危險
And,um,we don't believe that he's in any immediate danger.

751
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:31,070
他為什么要這樣做
Why would he do a thing like this?

752
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,360
他可能是想證明些什么
Maybe he thinks he has something to prove

753
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,310
因為我的...懷孕問題
'Cause of all of our... pregnancy stuff.

754
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:43,110
我覺得其中有很多原因
You know,I think that there are probably a number of reasons,

755
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:47,430
但主要原因是  他想做對的事
But the main one is that he just wants to do the right thing.

756
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:49,670
那才是他  那是他當警察的原因
I mean,that's who he is, that's why he became a cop,

757
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:52,060
那正是你愛上他的原因
That's why you fell in love with him.

758
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,510
我只想他平安回來
I just want him to come home.

759
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:57,480
貝克特  我有話跟你說
Hey,Beckett. I need to talk to you.

760
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,370
我們要去碼頭嗎
We going to the docks?

761
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,980
在碼頭只有兩件事可做
Only two things to do at the docks--

762
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,870
殺人或是釣魚
Kill someone or go fishing.

763
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,110
現在釣魚有點晚了  不是嗎
Kinda late to be fishing,ain't it?

764
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:20,440
是的  魚兒都睡著了
Yep. All the fishies are asleep.

765
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,430
什么情況
What now,huh?

766
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,010
我一直對你有所懷疑
You know,I had my suspicions about you

767
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:55,870
自你踏進雪芳的酒吧的那刻起
from the moment you walked into Siobhan's bar.

768
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,670
可每個人都說費頓是純爺們
But,no. Everybody said,"Fenton is stand-up. "

769
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:01,570
大家都相信你  包括鮑比·S
Everybody vouched for you,even Bobby S.

770
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,830
但你仍然懷疑我  是吧
But you still had your doubts,huh?

771
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,020
是的
That's right.

772
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:09,500
所以今天我讓基恩跟蹤你
So I had Keane follow you around today.

773
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:15,300
我知道我們之中有個奸細
You know,I knew that we had a rat amongst us.

774
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,710
但是我不明白的是
But what I didn't figure

775
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:23,280
他是怎么在我們眼皮子底下偽裝的
was how that rat could hide in plain sight.

776
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:41,000
-雪芳  -對不起
- Siobhan? - I'm sorry.

777
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,730
我也是  兄弟
So am I,brother.

778
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,420
基恩跟著你去了雪芳的家
Keane followed you over to Siobhan's place.

779
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,140
是的  我和她的鄰居聊天
Yeah,I spoke with one of her neighbors.

780
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,620
發現她兩天前被警察抓住了
Turns out she was picked up by the cops two days ago.

781
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:54,530
基恩很好奇  所以闖進了她家
Being an inquisitive lad,Keane broke in to her place.

782
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,130
告訴他你的發現吧  基恩
Tell him what you found,Keane.

783
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:58,140
我翻了她的手機記錄  費頓
I went through her cell phone,Fenton.

784
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,150
伙計  她曾和聯邦調查局通過話
Man,she's been talking to the FBI.

785
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:03,780
這一切無疑是她搗的鬼
After all this time, nothing but a snitch.

786
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,740
猶大的內心
A judas...

787
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,820
天使的臉龐
With an angel's face.

788
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:16,880
費頓  你知道的  我很講求公平
Now,Fenton,you know me. I'm nothing if not fair.

789
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,900
因此我給你一個公平的機會
So I'm gonna give you a fair chance

790
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,400
來證明你與此事無關
to prove you knew nothing about this.

791
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,330
打得她腦袋開花
Blow her brains out.

792
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,130
費頓  今晚不是她死
Fenton,we're leaving with one

793
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,560
就是你們一起死
or two bodies tonight.

794
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,900
全看你的說
It's up to you.

795
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:06,290
沒關系的  我不怪你
It's okay. It's not your fault.

796
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,350
開槍吧
Just do it.

797
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,700
我做不到  鮑比
I just can't do it, Bobby.

798
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,160
我不能打死她
I can't shoot her.

799
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,130
但是我能夠打死你
However I have no problem shooting you.

800
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,840
空彈匣  賤人
Empty. You son of a bitch.

801
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,870
以防萬一  兄弟
Had to be sure, friend.

802
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:48,290
該死的  我對你太失望了  費頓
And damn. I'm so disappointed in you, Fenton.

803
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:50,610
你還會更失望的
Not as disappointed as you're about to be.

804
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,770
我的真名不是費頓
My name's not Fenton.

805
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,320
而是凱文·萊恩
It's Kevin Ryan,

806
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,920
我是警察
And I'm a cop.

807
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,120
什么  你是警察
What? A cop?

808
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,870
沒錯  而且我要逮捕你們三個
Yeah, and I'm placing the three of you under arrest.

809
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:03,470
想得美
Well, that'll be a hell of a trick,

810
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:06,060
考慮到連姆馬上就要崩了你和你的女友
considering Liam's about to shoot you... and your girlfriend.

811
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,850
等等  連姆  先別動手
Wait a second. Liam, before you do that,

812
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:11,110
我先問你個問題  你的手機在哪兒
let me ask you a question. Where's your cell phone, huh?

813
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,000
什么
What?

814
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,600
還記得我們在大廳扭打的時候嗎
Remember when we tussled back in the hall?

815
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,120
沒錯  我掏了你口袋
Yeah. I picked your pocket.

816
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,550
然后趁你不注意的時候
And then when you weren't looking,

817
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,380
我打給了我的搭檔  讓電話一直通著
I dialed my partner and left the line open.

818
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,920
不可能
No way.

819
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,500
我們要去哪兒  他聽得清清楚楚
He heard exactly where we were going.

820
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,340
-連姆  -他在胡說  鮑比
- Liam. - He's full of crap, Bobby.

821
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,450
-他是嚇唬我們  -是嗎
- He's bluffing. - Oh, am I?

822
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,750
要不我們見見我的搭檔吧
Why don't we meet my partner, huh?

823
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:31,060
喂  哈維爾  你在哪兒
Yo, Javi, where you at?!

824
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,560
我在這兒  哥們
Right here, bro.

825
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,870
別輕舉妄動  他當過特種兵
No, no. He is former special forces.

826
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:44,200
你們不是他的對手
You do not want to draw on him.

827
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,910
還想見見其他伙伴嗎
Want to meet the rest of my crew?

828
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,470
嘿  貝克特
Hey, Beckett!

829
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,170
萊恩  是你打的電話嗎
You called, Ryan?

830
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:50,710
小子  別被她的美貌騙了
Don't let the looks fool you, boys.

831
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,530
你們也不是她的對手
You don't want to mess with her, either.

832
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:54,000
卡塞爾
Castle!

833
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:58,380
不是吧  我沒穿防彈衣呢
Seriously? I didn't... I didn't bring my vest.

834
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,970
放下武器  快
Drop your weapons. Now.

835
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,890
我有全紐約最好的律師
I got the best lawyer in New York.

836
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,540
我會被無罪釋放的
I'm gonna walk.

837
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,060
聯調局有了這個你跑不了
Not when I hand the Feds this.

838
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:36,760
一看這華麗麗的西裝三件套就知道
Snazzy 3-piece suit could only mean one thing...

839
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,580
萊恩回來了
Ryan is back.

840
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,610
是啊  是啊
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

841
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,930
連姆審得怎樣了
So where are we with Liam?

842
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,840
貝克特正在審呢  想讓他承認
Beckett's got him in the box, trying to get him to confess

843
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,860
自己殺了吉米·韋蘭
to Jimmy Whelan's murder.

844
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:49,340
沃克探員來電說  那本圣經真是好東西
And Agent Walker called. He said the bible you gave him is gold.

845
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,370
鮑比·S和他的同伙們都完蛋了
Bobby S and his whole crew are doing down.

846
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,740
哈維爾
And, uh, Javi...

847
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,010
那天在餐館
The other day at the diner--

848
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:57,120
沒事兒  當時那不是你本人
Don't sweat it. That wasn't you talkin', man.

849
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,400
那是費頓
That was Fenton.

850
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,370
謝謝理解
Yeah. Thanks.

851
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:04,400
你們一定不信  但連姆確實不是兇手
You guys aren't gonna believe this, But Liam is not our killer.

852
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,350
你說什么  可那確實是他的地鐵卡啊
What are you talking about? It was his MetroCard.

853
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,100
他是用自己的信用卡付錢的
He paid for it with his own credit card,

854
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,100
他從鮑比車上下來后刷過卡
And then he swiped it after he dropped off Bobby's car.

855
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,520
我知道  但他有不在場證明
I know, but his alibi is solid.

856
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,510
他當時在斯塔頓島
He was on Staten Island at that time.

857
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,640
如果他有不在場證明
Okay, well, if he has a solid alibi,

858
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,490
唯一的問題就是
the only question that remains is,

859
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:20,720
誰能拿到他的地鐵卡
who had access to his MetroCard?

860
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:23,880
瑪吉
Maggie...

861
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,050
我覺得你能干出很多事  但不會去殺人
You know, I pegged you for a lot of things, never a killer.

862
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:29,720
是啊  我也沒想到你會是個緝毒大隊長
Yeah, I pegged you for a lot of things, but never a narc.

863
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,910
其實我是兇殺案警探
Actually, see, I'm a homicide detective,

864
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:34,530
所以我知道你殺了烘焙師吉米
which is why I know that you killed Jimmy the Baker.

865
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,810
什么吉米
Jimmy the who?

866
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:38,040
老天  你還要和我們玩下去嗎
Oh, god. Are we actually gonna play this game?

867
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,590
不早了  我都累了
It's late. I am tired.

868
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:42,340
警察搜了你家  找到了你的槍
Officers went through your house, And they found your gun.

869
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,530
和射殺吉米的槍口徑一致
Same caliber that killed Jimmy.

870
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,670
遲早我們會查出兩支槍彈道一致
It's only a matter of time before we get a ballistics match.

871
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,000
這么說  連姆不知道他老婆做了什么
So Liam had no idea what his wife was doing?

872
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,100
對  都是瑪吉干的
No, it was all Maggie.

873
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,740
她知道連姆忠心耿耿
She knew that Liam was too loyal,

874
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:57,770
她覺得只有她把鮑比·S送進監獄
and she figured that if she could get Bobby S in prison,

875
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:00,540
她丈夫才能稱王
her husband would ascend to the throne.

876
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,970
看來瑪吉就像《麥克白》里的麥克白夫人
So really, lady Maggie was lady Macbeth,

877
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:05,400
不過她是愛爾蘭人  不是蘇格蘭人
only she was Irish, not Scottish.

878
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:10,290
凱特  說起喬丹
Listen, Kate, about Jordan...

879
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:12,050
如果你不想說的話  就別說了
You know what? If, uh, if you don't want to talk about it--

880
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:14,940
我想談  不過
No, I-I-I wanna, but...

881
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,700
如果你不喜歡你看到的會怎樣
What happens if you don't like what you see?

882
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,840
如果你不讓我看到會怎樣
What happens if you don't let me look?

883
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:27,700
喬丹汽車公司  在1916到1931年間生產汽車
Jordan Motor Company. They made cars from 1916 to 1931.

884
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,770
這就是喬丹  所謂的大秘密  一家倒閉的公司
That's Jordan? That's the big secret, A defunct car company?

885
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:34,650
算是吧  這得追溯到我在寄宿學校上學的時候
Sort of. It goes back to my boarding school days.

886
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:37,990
那是第一個學期  我差點兒被退學
My first semester there, I was in danger of flunking out.

887
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:41,400
我期末考必須拿A
I needed an "A" on my term paper.

888
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,190
所以你就圍繞那家公司寫了篇文章
So you wrote the paper on that car company?

889
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:47,290
不  是別人寫的
No. Someone else did,

890
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,100
然后我給了他250美元
and I paid him $250.

891
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,980
卡塞爾  這是你小時候的事
Um, Castle, that happened when you were a kid.

892
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:56,000
我沒搞懂這怎么改變我對你的看法了
I don't understand why that would change how I see you.

893
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,530
因為它改變我對自己的看法了
Because it changed how I saw myself.

894
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:01,730
老師在班上讀了我的文章
The teacher read the paper to the entire class

895
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:05,300
當成了優秀范文  大家為我鼓了掌
as an example of great writing, and they applauded.

896
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,170
那是我第一次被表揚
It was the first time I was celebrated ev--for anything,

897
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:10,420
但卻是個謊言
And... it was a fraud.

898
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:14,300
我是個騙子
I... I was a fraud.

899
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,820
從那時起  我開始學寫作
That's when I learned how to write.

900
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,530
我寫啊寫
I wrote and wrote,

901
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:22,060
努力讓自己成為大家稱贊的那個人
trying to be as great as everyone thought I was...

902
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,040
努力贏取稱贊
trying to earn that applause.

903
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,070
我現在仍在努力
I'm still trying.

904
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,990
你說得對  卡塞爾  這確實改變了我的看法
You're right, Castle. It does change how I see you.

905
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:38,360
讓我更喜歡你了一點點
It makes me like you just a little bit more.

906
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:50,960
別忘了胡子先生
Don't forget Mr. Whiskers.

907
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,980
你現在倒是記得他的名字了
Oh, so now you remember his name.

908
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:56,800
能讓我倆聊會兒嗎
Could you give us a second, please?

909
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,400
我正惦記著你能不能來呢
I was hoping you'd come.

910
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,720
這回我得道個別
I wanted to say good-bye this time.

911
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:07,600
道別讓我覺得以后再見不到你了
"Good-bye" makes me feel like I'll never see you again.

912
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,240
確實啊
You won't.

913
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:14,350
明天  你就會到一個新的城市  有個新的名字
Tomorrow you'll be in a new city, have a new name.

914
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:17,120
你會重新開始
You'll get to start over again.

915
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:21,250
為什么你要這么做  為我冒生命危險
Why'd you do this, risk your life for me?

916
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:24,670
你知道的
You know why.

917
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,750
這個叫凱文·萊恩的家伙
This Kevin Ryan guy,

918
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:32,210
真希望再早點認識他
I wish I would've met him sooner.

919
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,760
對不起  珍妮
I'm sorry, Jenny.

920
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,600
我知道這對你不公平
I know it wasn't fair to you.

921
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,450
告訴我真相
Just tell me the truth.

922
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:04,800
你做臥底的生活結束了嗎
Is this part of your life, this undercover part, over?

923
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:07,620
-是啊  結束了  -好
- Yeah, it is now. - Good.

924
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:11,450
因為我要知道你會在我身邊
Because I need to know that you're gonna be here.

925
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:14,890
我要知道自己能依靠你
A-and I need to know that I can depend on you,

926
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,590
尤其是因為
Especially after the test results

927
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,590
產科醫生給我們的檢查結果
we got back from the fertility doctor.

928
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:20,470
-不  壞消息嗎  -是啊
- Oh, no. Bad news? - Yeah.

929
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:23,420
我們做那檢查真是瞎折騰一場
We took all those damn tests for nothing.

930
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,890
我已經懷孕了
I'm already pregnant.

931
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:32,850
你懷孕了
You're pregnant?

932
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,320
你懷孕了
You're pregnant.

933
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:40,710
我們開香檳吧
Let's, uh, let's pop some champagne.

934
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:42,680
不行  我們不能喝香檳
No. We can't pop any champagne

935
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,940
你知道的  因為
You know why...because...

936
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,550
-你懷孕了  -我懷孕了
- You're pregnant. - I'm pregnant.
