11
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,590
911  请陈述紧急情况
9-1-1, what's your emergency?

12
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,370
救救我  求你了
You have to help me. Please.

13
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,070
我只剩几秒钟了
I only have a few seconds left.

14
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,450
女士  请报地址
Ma'am, what's your address?

15
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,740
C大街250号  求你们快点
250 Avenue C. Please hurry.

16
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:25,560
我们马上派人过去
We'll send help right away.

17
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,290
可以告诉我出什么事了吗
Can you tell me what's happening?

18
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,240
女士  我得知道发生什么事了
Ma'am, I need to know what's going on.

19
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,640
上帝啊
Oh, my god.

20
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,830
女士  听得见吗
Ma'am, can you hear me?

21
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:37,650
灯灭了
The lights went out.

22
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,320
它来找我了
It's coming for me.

23
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,300
什么来找你了  女士
What's coming for you? Ma'am?

24
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,640
女士
Ma'am?

25
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,830
我要死了
I'm gonna die.

26
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,530
还在吗  喂
Are you there? Hello.

27
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,560
女士你还在吗  喂
Ma'am Are you there? Hello.

28
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,460
听见了吗
You hear that?

29
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,300
电话是被害人瓦尔·巴特勒  
That call came in at 11:59

30
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,000
在11点59分打的
from our vic--Val Butler.

31
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,380
她在市区做广告主管
She's an ad exec downtown.

32
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,190
急救人员稍后赶到时
First responders came moments later.

33
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,400
沙发抵在紧锁的门上
That door was locked and that couch was in front of it.

34
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,920
没有强行入室的迹象
No sign of forced entry.

35
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,700
她看起来像是被吓死的  真正被吓死的
She looks like she's been scared to death, literally.

36
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,270
这是基于你渊博的医疗经验吗  卡塞尔先生
Is that based on your vast medical experience, Mr. Castle?

37
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,200
不  基于她看起来
No, based on the fact

38
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,110
其作品多以死亡为主题

39
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,110
像是爱德华·蒙克的画
She looks like an Edvard Munch painting.

40
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,330
真够吓人的
Really freaky.

41
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,930
死因是什么
So what was the cause of death?

42
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,760
没有外部伤痕
Well, there's no external trauma,

43
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,510
没有刺伤类伤痕
no puncture or stab wounds.

44
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,460
给她进行尸检后
Once I get her on the slab,

45
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,400
我会对死因及凶手有进一步的了解
I'll know more about how she died and who did it.

46
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,720
得是个人才行
If it was a who.

47
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:30,590
什么意思
Meaning?

48
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,870
她说的是"它来找我了"
Meaning she said "It's coming for me."

49
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:35,300
不是他或她  而是它
Not "He" or "She," but "It."

50
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,100
你们瞧她都在看什么
Look at what she was researching here--

51
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,600
《如何辟邪》
"How To Keep Away Evil,"

52
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,600
《如何抵挡恶灵》
"How To Ward Off Evil Spirits,"

53
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,210
都市传说的书
A book on urban legends.

54
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,560
门那边  挂着马蹄
Over by the door, horseshoes.

55
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,510
还有两个印第安风铃
I've clocked two indian wind chimes,

56
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,960
这里和那里
There and there.

57
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,320
这些是用来抵挡恶灵的
These are things used to ward off evil spirits,

58
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,660
比如说帕穆特医生
like Perlmutter.

59
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,720
我听到了
I heard that.

60
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,110
你什么意思  卡塞尔
What are you saying, Castle?

61
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,600
是恶灵要了她的命吗
Oh, was the boogeyman out to get her?

62
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,470
我是说也许这是她的想法
I'm saying maybe that's what she thought--

63
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,760
所以才会说  "它来找我了"
Why she said "It's coming for me,"

64
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,430
所以灯灭了
why the lights went out,

65
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,290
她又死得这么离奇  
why she inexplicably died,

66
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,000
而且看起来很害怕
and why she looks so scared.

67
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,260
她害怕是因为她要被杀害了
She was scared because she was about to be killed

68
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,750
凶手是个人
by an actual person.

69
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,510
所以我们该努力找出这个人
So we should spend our time looking for that person.

70
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,550
大家开始排查  在楼内逐一问话
Let's set up a canvass and talk to everyone in the building

71
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,890
看有谁听到或看到什么
that might have seen or heard something.

72
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,260
瓦尔出什么事了
Wh-what happened to Val?

73
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,010
到底怎么回事
What's going on?

74
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,100
我晚上在大学做研究助理
I work nights as a research assistant at the college.

75
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,100
我昨晚应该留在家里的
But I should've stayed home last night.

76
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,260
我知道她碰到麻烦了
I knew something was up with her.

77
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,330
什么意思
What do you mean?

78
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,380
过去几天她非常奇怪
She's been weird the past couple of days.

79
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,020
不吃不睡
She hadn't been eating or sleeping.

80
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,530
总是疑神疑鬼的  总是锁上门
She was really paranoid, always locking the doors.

81
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,970
她说了是什么问题吗
Did she say what was wrong?

82
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,640
我问了
I asked,

83
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,100
但她说她不想谈
but she said she didn't want to talk about it.

84
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,520
阿曼达  你知不知道
Amanda, do you know of anyone

85
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,890
是否有人想伤害她
that would've wanted to hurt her?

86
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,540
她的前男友
Her ex-boyfriend.

87
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,340
前男友叫弗雷迪·贝克
Boyfriend's name is Freddie Baker,

88
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,270
31岁
31.

89
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,430
案底相当精彩  拒捕
Quite the resume-- resisting arrest,

90
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,550
人身攻击
assault and battery.

91
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,560
听起来像是白马王子
Sounds like a prince.

92
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,810
不过瓦尔变聪明了
Yeah, Val wised up, though.

93
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,300
分手后  她申请了法院限制令
She filed a restraining order against him after they broke up.

94
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,780
埃斯波西托在查他昨晚在哪里
Esposito is checking into where he was last night.

95
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,600
瓦尔的家人和朋友那边有什么消息
So what did we get from Val's family and friends?

96
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,090
他们过去三天都没联络上她
Just that they hadn't heard from her in the last three days.

97
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,270
她不回任何信息
She wasn't returning their messages.

98
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,930
三天  瓦尔的室友说她
Three days--that's how long Val's roommate

99
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:13,990
正是三天前开始变奇怪的
said she'd been acting strangely.

100
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,860
我调查了她人生的最后72小时
Yeah, so I dug into the last 72 hours of her life.

101
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,000
除了用信用卡支付
Besides a credit card charge

102
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,460
去格林威治的火车票
for a train ticket to Greenwich,

103
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,610
没其它不寻常的
there was nothing else unusual.

104
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,820
她去格林威治做什么
What was she doing in Greenwich?

105
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,910
这我还在查
I'm still looking into that,

106
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,260
但过去几天的反常情况
but as far as abnormalities for the last few days,

107
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:25,960
就这些了
that was it.

108
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,900
不  还有  风铃
Uh, no, there's more. The wind chime,

109
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,500
马蹄  都市传说的书
the horse shoe, the book on urban legends--

110
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,440
都是两天前网上购买的
All bought online two days ago.

111
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,150
仿佛是瓦尔认为
Almost as if Val thought

112
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,110
某种恶灵找上她了
some kind of evil spirit was coming for her.

113
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,470
卡塞尔  她觉得会发生的
Castle, what she thought was gonna happen

114
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,510
与事实发生的
versus what actually happened

115
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,960
完全是两码事
are two completely different things.

116
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,940
对  如果说瓦尔有什么麻烦
Yeah, because if Val was a victim of anything,

117
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,560
就是她挑男人的眼光太差
it's her lousy taste in men.

118
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,840
排查有结果
Canvass popped.

119
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,420
有个邻居见到弗雷迪在她死前一小时
One of her neighbors saw Freddie in the building

120
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,730
出现在公寓大楼
an hour before her death.

121
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,610
我绝不会伤害瓦尔的
I would never hurt Val.

122
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,870
我爱她
I loved her.

123
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,710
真的吗  那你如何解释她申请的针对你的
Really? Then how do you explain this restraining order

124
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,320
法院限制令
that she filed against you?

125
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,690
这是情书吗
Was that a love letter?

126
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,110
这是误会
A misunderstanding.

127
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,240
我们有目击证人看到你
Well, we got a witness that saw you

128
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,850
昨晚去了瓦尔的公寓  弗雷迪
in Val's apartment last night, Freddie.

129
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,200
但我没有杀她
But I didn't kill her.

130
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,430
没错  我去了
Yes, I went over there,

131
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,560
但那是因为她求我去的
but only because she begged me to.

132
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,060
你觉得我们会相信
Do you actually expect us to believe

133
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,060
她在申请法院限制令后
that she invited you over to her apartment

134
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,990
还会邀请你过去吗
after she filed a restraining order?

135
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,280
真的  她说她想复合
It's true. She said she wanted to get back together.

136
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,350
但我去了后  她只是
But when I got there, all she did was

137
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,680
指责我给她寄了什么包裹
accuse me of sending her some package.

138
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,240
什么包裹
What package?

139
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,560
我也不知道
I have no idea.

140
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,710
但当我说我什么都没寄过时
But when I told her I didn't send her anything,

141
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,170
她就开始慌了
she started freaking out.

142
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,260
什么意思
How was she freaking out?

143
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,900
她不停念叨  "这是真的"
She kept saying, "It's real".

144
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,890
什么是真的
What's real?

145
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,050
不知道
I don't know.

146
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,560
她的话  完全语无伦次
She wasn't making... any sense.

147
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,000
她不断问我
She kept asking me

148
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,170
是否相信恶魔的力量
if I believed in the power of evil.

149
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,350
我不想因为违反限制令惹祸上身
I didn't want to get in trouble for breaking the R.O.,

150
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,530
就离开她家  跟朋友出去了
so I got out of there, went to hang out with friends.

151
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,930
但我离开她家的时候
But when I left that apartment,

152
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,960
瓦尔绝对还活着
Val was alive.

153
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,420
我发誓
I swear.

154
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,090
弗雷迪的不在场证明核实了
Freddie's alibi checks out.

155
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,510
他的朋友证实他11点与他们碰面
Friends confirm that he met them at 11:00.

156
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,080
他们在一家夜店玩到天亮
They hung out at a club till dawn.

157
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,640
那么他不是凶手了
So he's not our guy.

158
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,260
我只想提醒你们  瓦尔问他
Well, I'll just point out that Val asked him

159
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,750
是否相信恶魔的力量
if he believed in the power of evil

160
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,970
还不断说什么是真的
and then was talking about how it was "real".

161
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,590
-我不愿这么说...  -那就别说
- I hate to say it-- - Then don't.

162
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,900
鉴证组在她公寓里发现包裹了吗
Did C.S.U. find a package at her apartment?

163
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,620
没  但他们光顾着找凶案证物没查邮件
No, but they were looking for evidence of the murder not mail.

164
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,500
也许那才是让她惊慌的东西
So maybe that's what freaked Val out.

165
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,680
她知道寄包裹的人想要杀她
She knew that that package was coming from her killer.

166
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:23,970
有什么发现吗
Did you find anything yet?

167
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,150
有  柜子里的细高跟鞋比你的还多
Yes, a closet with more stilettos than yours.

168
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,410
我以为你的鞋量已无人能及了
Didn't think it was possible.

169
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,380
你呢  有发现吗
How about you? Any luck?

170
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,660
有  似乎她收到的包裹
Uh, yes. Looks like the package she got

171
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,130
里面有一张CD或DVD
contained a CD or a DVD

172
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,180
所以留心找找光碟
so be on the lookout for a disc.

173
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,500
光碟  明白了
Disc, got ya.

174
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,750
救我
Help me.

175
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,940
贝克特
Uh, Beckett?

176
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,680
贝克特
Beckett?

177
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,420
你能过来一下吗
Can you come here?

178
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,300
你看过了
You saw!

179
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,010
第三天的午夜
Midnight on the third day...

180
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,310
就是你的死期
you die!

181
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,950
你还好吧  你找到什么了吗
Are you okay? Did you find something?

182
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,940
你说瓦尔是哪天收到包裹的
When did you say Val got that package?

183
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,360
遇害前三天
Three days before she died.

184
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,860
正是第三天的午夜
That was midnight on the third day.

185
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,340
她是因为看这光碟而死
She died because she saw this disc.

186
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,170
现在我也看了
And now I saw it,

187
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,830
下一个就是我了
which means I'm next.

188
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:46,070
灵

189
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:46,070
书

190
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:46,070
妙

191
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:46,070
探

192
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:46,070
灵

193
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:46,070
书

194
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:46,070
妙

195
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:46,070
探

196
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:46,070
第五季 第十七集

197
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,390
据传有一段神秘的录像
"Legend tells of a mysterious video

198
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:57,510
能够控制冥界恶魔的力量
"that can harness the forces of evil from the beyond.

199
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,400
这张碟预示着巨大的不幸
"The disc is a harbinger of great misfortune,

200
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,700
标记它的观看者
"marking its watchers

201
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,140
并让他们无法逃脱死亡的下场
and sentencing them to certain and unavoidable death."

202
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,370
我跟瓦尔一样看到了光碟
I saw it, just like Val did.

203
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,970
所以她才会说  "它来找我了"
That's why she said "It's coming for me".

204
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,600
所以她知道自己何时会死
That's how she knew when she was gonna die,

205
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,100
并竭尽全力阻挡恶灵
why she was trying to ward off spirits--

206
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,440
都是因为看到了光碟上的讯息
because of the message on that disc.

207
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,750
一张DVD要怎么杀人
How's a DVD gonna kill you?

208
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,180
它会像超级忍者那样  砍下你的脑袋吗
Is it gonna come at you like a ninja star, cut your head off?

209
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,390
碟片本身不会置你于死地  埃斯波西托
The actual DVD will not kill me, Esposito.

210
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,060
是里面的灵魂
It will be the spirit inside the DVD,

211
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,260
就像《午夜凶铃》里那样
just like in "The Ring".

212
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,040
就是  是那个...
Ooh, ooh, the one...

213
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,400
全身湿透了的诡异的小女孩
with the creepy waterlogged little girl

214
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,390
从电视机里爬出来的那部
who crawls out of the TV.

215
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,940
看过那片子后我好些天没睡
I didn't sleep for days after that movie.

216
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,710
没错  谢谢  那电影
Yes, exactly. Thank you. That movie.

217
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,710
是编出来的
It's fiction.

218
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,950
是讲都市传说的书上的一个恐怖故事
It's a horror story in a book about urban legends.

219
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,380
对  我是说  因为
Yeah, I mean, because...

220
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,770
仅此而已  对不对
that's all it is, right?

221
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,130
只是个传说
A legend.

222
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,420
很多传说都来源于现实
Many legends are based in truth.

223
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,650
我看了录像
I saw the video.

224
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,290
三天后的午夜  我就会死
At midnight in three days time, I will die.

225
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,590
卡塞尔  那讯息不是留给你的
Oh, Castle, that message wasn't for you.

226
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,430
是给瓦尔的恐吓  并非来自灵魂
It was a threat for Val. And it wasn't made by spirits.

227
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,170
而是来自杀害她的凶手
It was made by her murderer.

228
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,610
那么追踪到寄光碟的人
So tracing the disc to whoever sent it

229
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,030
就能找到凶手了
should lead us straight to him.

230
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,030
-埃斯波  -是
- Espo. - Yeah.

231
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:03,160
这个空运单上有个信箱  你能查查吗
There's a P.O. box on this airbill. Could you look into it?

232
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,550
-行  -还有  莱恩
- Yeah. - And, Ryan, why don't you

233
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,660
你也来看看这光碟  看...
take a look at this disc and see--

234
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,310
抱歉  什么
Oh, I'm--I'm sorry, what?

235
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,490
你也这样  兄弟
Et tu, bro?

236
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,090
你不是说这个故事就是个传说吗
What did you say about the story being a legend?

237
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,650
没错  但
Um, well, uh,

238
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:15,790
珍妮和我
Jenny and I,

239
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,540
我们在努力造人
we are trying to make a baby,

240
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,030
所以书上写的所有迷信我们都得信
so we're abiding by every superstition in the book.

241
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,230
好吧  那你来  埃斯波
Okay. Fine. Here, Espo.

242
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,200
不  我不  我不能
Oh, nah. I c-- I can't--

243
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,480
我不能看那个
I can't watch that.

244
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,320
要是我看了这个  就显得我的搭档
If I watch that, it's gonna make my partner out

245
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,730
是胆小鬼
to be a wimp,

246
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,840
我不能这样
and I can't have that.

247
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,200
-多谢  兄弟  -没事
- Thanks, bro. - Yeah.

248
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,710
我真为你俩悲哀
This is so pathetic.

249
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,260
好吧  我看就是了
Fine. I will watch it.

250
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:37,930
等等  你这是干什么
Wait. No. What are you doing?

251
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,340
卡塞尔  我在做我的本职工作
Castle, I'm doing my job.

252
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,400
这里总得有人干吧
Someone here has to.

253
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,550
想想可能的后果
Okay, think of the risks.

254
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,120
你也许不信这些
You may not think there's anything to this,

255
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,210
但万一你错了呢
but what if you're wrong?

256
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,660
我很感谢你的关心
You know, I appreciate your concern,

257
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,200
但这不过是张光碟罢了
but it's just a DVD.

258
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,190
不  你不能就这么播
You--you don't-- you can't just play it.

259
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,350
让我做点预防措施
Let me take precautions here.

260
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,320
不能让整个分局的人都跟我一起遭殃
Don't want the whole precinct suffering my fate.

261
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,310
好吧  好吧
Okay. Okay.

262
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,970
你想握着我的手吗
You want to hold my hand?

263
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,180
卡塞尔  我一点不害怕
Castle, I'm not scared.

264
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,040
可是我害怕呀
Well, I wasn't asking for you.

265
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,030
准备好了吗
Are you ready?

266
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,230
有差别吗
Does it matter?

267
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,750
救我
Help me.

268
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,500
那是什么声音
What are those sounds?

269
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,840
我说吧  后面的更糟
Right? It gets worse.

270
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,710
马上就到了
Wait for it.

271
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,250
你看过了
You saw!

272
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,040
三天后的午夜
Midnight on the third day...

273
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,440
就是你的死期
You die!

274
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,070
没错  是有点恐怖
You're right. It is kinda creepy.

275
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,860
谢谢
Thank you.

276
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,290
因为凶手故意做的很恐怖  卡塞尔
Because the killer made it creepy, Castle.

277
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,650
也许死者曾见过这些画面
Maybe these images meant something to the victim,

278
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:53,740
或许能查出她和凶手的关系
clues to the relationship between her and the killer.

279
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,710
等等
Wait.

280
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,450
倒回去
Go back.

281
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,080
那个  那个  那是...
That one--that one there. That's the, um...

282
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,430
那是西藏轮  象征着重生
That's the tibetan wheel. Symbolizes rebirth.

283
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,760
等下
Hang on.

284
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,270
那是个共济会罗盘  那是...
That is the masonic compass. That's...

285
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,550
那代表了复活
They felt it represented, uh, resurrection.

286
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,930
你想说什么
Your point being?

287
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:21,170
重生  复活
Rebirth? Resurrection?

288
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,890
这段录像显然复活了某个死去的东西
This video obviously resurrects something from the great beyond,

289
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:25,750
危险的东西
something dangerous,

290
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,850
会杀人的东西
something... murderous.

291
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,440
还能有什么别的解释呢
I mean, what other explanation can there be?

292
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,090
有很多解释  卡塞尔
There are plenty of explanations, Castle,

293
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,970
而且都与超自然现象无关
and none of them are supernatural.

294
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,110
实际上  我敢说帕穆特已经查明死因了
In fact, I bet Perlmutter has our cause of death by now.

295
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:39,650
毒检尸检报告都应该出来了
Those tox and autopsy reports should be done.

296
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,960
贝克特探长
Ah, Detective Beckett

297
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,250
还有讨厌鬼卡塞尔
and defective Castle.

298
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,710
帕穆特  瓦尔·巴特勒是怎么死的
So, Perlmutter, how was Val Butler killed?

299
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,640
死于心力衰竭
It appears she died of heart failure.

300
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,820
27岁吗
At 27?

301
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,410
她有心脏疾病吗
Did she have heart problems?

302
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,650
心脏停跳绝对是个毛病
Well, she certainly did once it stopped beating.

303
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:03,820
为什么会停跳
What made it stop?

304
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,200
有没有可能是中毒
Is it possible that she was poisoned

305
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,000
或是吸毒过量
or O.D.'ed on drugs?

306
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,630
血检没有异常
Nothing showed up on her blood panels.

307
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,330
那是什么导致她...
What about what caused her, um...

308
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,100
死后面部肌肉收缩
Well, postmortem contractions of the facial muscles

309
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,600
也并不是前所未闻
are not unheard of.

310
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,970
你不知道死因是什么
You don't know what killed her.

311
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,530
-不能这么说  -你有想法了吗
- I wouldn't say that. - Do you have a theory?

312
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:21,660
现在还没
Not at the present time.

313
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,810
那就是说你不知道
That means you don't know.

314
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,150
唯一的解释
And the only explanation

315
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,940
就是瓦尔看到了极其吓人的东西
is that Val faced something so scary,

316
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,750
于是心脏停跳  
it stopped her heart

317
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:30,030
脸也僵在最后的表情上  就是惊恐
and froze her face in the last expression she had, terror.

318
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,120
承认吧
Admit it.

319
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,590
卡塞尔先生  我只能说  到目前为止
All I'll say, Mr. Castle, is that for now,

320
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,090
死因未知
cause of death is unknown.

321
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,220
未知
Unknown?

322
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,780
听见了吗
Hear that?

323
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,770
不妙啊
Not good.

324
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,060
你在干什么
What are you doing?

325
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,300
看我的遗愿清单
Checking my bucket list

326
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,790
看两天内我能实现几条
to see how many things I can get done in two days.

327
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,400
你们有谁能把我介绍给比尔·夏特纳吗
Can either one of you introduce me to Bill Shatner?

328
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,400
即威廉·夏特纳  《星际迷航》的柯克舰长

329
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,340
查明是谁寄了这张光盘
You know, finding who sent this disc

330
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,070
应该能让卡塞尔好受一点
should make Castle feel a whole lot better.

331
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,280
是啊  但如果真被卡塞尔说中
Yeah, but what if the worst happens

332
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,490
发生了最糟的情况呢
and--and Castle's right?

333
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,400
你觉得他会在遗嘱里提到我吗
Do you think he put me in his will?

334
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,250
老兄  一点都不好玩
Dude, uncool.

335
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,080
怎么了
What?

336
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,740
我就是好奇
I'm just wondering.

337
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,080
卡塞尔要是死了是挺难过的
I mean, Castle's death would be sad and all,

338
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:08,010
但他的法拉利绝对能减轻我的悲痛
but his Ferrari sure would lessen my grief.

339
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,510
你知道光说这种话也会遭报应吧
You do realize that even putting that out in the universe is bad karma?

340
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,670
拜托  卡塞尔不会死的
Please. Castle's not gonna die.

341
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,300
我们要抓的也不是恶灵
We're not dealing with an evil spirit.

342
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,380
我们要抓的是有寄件人地址的人
We're dealing with a guy who has a return address.

343
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,560
邮政服务

344
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,280
为什么大家都来问1135号邮箱呢
Why does everybody keep asking about box 1135?

345
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,850
等下  还有谁问了
Wait. Who else has been asking about it?

346
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,490
有个褐发的女人几天前来过
Some brunette chick came in here a couple days ago.

347
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,740
大概是瓦尔
Probably Val.

348
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,940
你怎么跟她说的
What did you tell her?

349
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,130
什么都没说
Nothing, bruh.

350
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,620
有违公司规定
It's against company policy.

351
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,580
我觉得这个胜过公司规定
Well, I think that this trumps company policy.

352
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,130
邮箱是谁的
So who owns the box?

353
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,050
这就是奇怪的地方了
Ah, that's the weird thing.

354
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,770
邮箱的主人大概在三个月前死了
The guy who owns it died, like, three months ago.

355
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,430
所以他不可能寄包裹
So he couldn't have sent that package

356
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,310
除非他是从冥府寄的
unless he sent it from the great beyond.

357
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,430
邮箱最后的租客是安德鲁·莱维
The box was last rented by an Andrew Levine,

358
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,320
他三个月前死于肝功能衰竭
who died of liver failure three months ago.

359
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,990
不过我觉得他和案件无关
Somehow I don't think he's connected to this case.

360
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,130
那么凶手掩盖了踪迹
So the killer covered his tracks.

361
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:56,070
他一定是在寄件单上随便写了一个邮箱号
He must have written a random P.O. box on the packaging slip.

362
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:59,400
-或者  -不  莱恩  没有或者
- Or-- - No. Ryan, there is no "Or."

363
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,120
我只是说  也许我们追查不到
I'm just saying, maybe the reason

364
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,520
包裹源头的原因
we can't trace this package's origin

365
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,290
是因为它是从另一个世界寄来的
is because it was sent from another realm.

366
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,370
莱恩说得对  是从另一个世界寄来的
Ryan's right. It was sent from another realm.

367
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,880
新泽西
New Jersey.

368
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,330
我查了瓦尔包裹的空运单号
I looked into the airbill number on Val's package.

369
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,280
发现是同一个人寄出的
Turns out it's one in a sequence of airbills

370
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,400
几张空运单中的一个
all sent from the same guy--

371
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:16,760
寄件人杰森·本内特
Jason Bennett.

372
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,170
他住在霍博肯
He lives in Hoboken.

373
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,040
纽约警局
NYPD!

374
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,220
兄弟  我想告诉你
Hey, bro. I just want you to know...

375
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:29,630
我觉得你应该知道
I just thought you should know

376
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,080
我很珍视我们的友谊
that I really value our friendship.

377
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,930
好吧  谢了
Okay. Thanks.

378
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,770
对我来说是无价的
It's priceless to me.

379
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,390
很好
Great.

380
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,120
如果我们能给它定个价  你觉得是多少
But if we could put a price on it, what would that be?

381
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,560
你在说什么呢
What are you talking about?

382
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,610
我只想知道我们的友谊值多少
I just want to know how much our friendship would be worth

383
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,500
如果你...
if you were--

384
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,490
死了
Dead!

385
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,140
我们来晚了
We got to Bennett too late.

386
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,940
对  晚了差不多两天
Yeah, uh, about two days too late.

387
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,810
看起来他死了有两天了
That looks like about how long he's been dead.

388
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,130
他不可能杀死瓦尔
He couldn't have killed Val.

389
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,120
而他四天前
And he got a package

390
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,620
和瓦尔一样收到了装有光盘的包裹
with a disc in it just like Val, four days ago.

391
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,140
这里也断电了
There was a blackout here, too.

392
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,490
同样的作案手法  同样吓人的尸体
Same M.O., same freaky-ass body.

393
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,960
第三个午夜
The third day at midnight.

394
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,360
我就知道不该让你看那光盘
I knew I shouldn't have let you watch that disc.

395
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,680
现在不到48小时
Now in 48 hours...

396
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:16,790
我们俩都会死
We'll both be dead.

397
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
时间轴：三水  裙带菜

398
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
校对：大卫熊  请叫我草海柱    后期&监制：瓜瓜

399
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,000
鉴证组在杰森家发现了一堆空运单
C.S.U. just found a stack of airbills at Jason's place.

400
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,390
这么说  杀手用了其中一个
So then the killer used one of them

401
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,010
寄光碟给瓦尔
to send the disc to Val.

402
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,770
或许我们该复制一份光盘
Maybe we should make a copy of the DVD

403
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:36,860
寄给别人
and send it to someone else.

404
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,390
这是《午夜凶铃》里救人的方式
That's how they saved people in "The Ring."

405
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,860
对  可收到拷贝的人都死了
Yeah, but all those people who got a copy died.

406
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,010
是啊  你那是把皮球踢给别人
Yeah, you'd just be passing the buck off to someone else.

407
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:42,800
很冷血  兄弟
That's cold, bro.

408
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,570
好吧  谁有高见
Okay, does anyone have a better solution?

409
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:45,730
我们没有对策了
Because we need one,

410
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,670
就算不为我  也为贝克特着想吧
if not for me, at least for Beckett.

411
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:50,660
卡塞尔  你真好  你宁可把生的希望留给我
Castle, that's so sweet. You want me to outlive you?

412
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,710
当然了
Of course.

413
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,610
不然谁为我的无私和牺牲精神歌功颂德
Who else is gonna tell my tale of sacrifice and selflessness?

414
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:56,960
好了  我们不必给任何人歌功颂德
Okay, we won't be telling anyone anything.

415
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,240
我们都不会有事
We're both gonna be fine.

416
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,070
都有两个看过光碟的人死了
How can you say that when we have not one

417
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,380
你怎么还能说这话
but two dead DVD watchers?

418
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,770
这两名死者除了那张光碟
There's gotta be a better connection

419
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,180
一定还有更合理的联系
between our two victims than that disc.

420
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,920
莱恩  去问下杰森的家人
Ryan, can you check in with Jason's family,

421
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,410
看有没有人认识瓦尔
see if anyone recognizes Val?

422
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,320
好  这就去
Yeah. On it.

423
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,750
埃斯波西托  你不如去对照一下他们的档案
Espo, why don't you cross-reference their records

424
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,670
看他们俩之间是否有相似点
and see if there are any similarities between the two of them?

425
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,100
如果我们俩的照片要贴在那板上
You know, if there's gonna be pictures of us hanging up there,

426
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,450
我们现在就该选照片了
we should really pick 'em out now.

427
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,570
卡塞尔
You know, Castle...

428
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,800
我们可以用那张
We could always use the photo

429
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,110
我前几天给你拍的床照
that I took of you in bed the other night.

430
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,880
我不确定我想给大家留下那种印象
I don't know if that's how I want to be remembered.

431
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,670
卡塞尔  我开玩笑的
Castle, I was joking.

432
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,730
我们的照片不会贴在那块板上
There will be no photos of us on that murder board.

433
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,310
到明天  我们会找到
By tomorrow, we are gonna find a connection

434
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,270
这两名死者的联系
between our two victims

435
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,760
直接引导我们找到真实存在的凶手
that will leads us straight to a flesh-and-blood killer.

436
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,800
与此同时
In the meantime...

437
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,100
现在不早了  好吗
It's getting kinda late, okay?

438
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,500
我们就查到这里吧
So why don't we just call it a night?

439
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,750
知道吗  其实
You know what? Actually...

440
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,160
我们今晚可以回我家
We could go back to my place tonight

441
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,620
多拍点照片
and take some more photos.

442
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,180
我可能相信
Well, I might be convin--

443
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,330
等等
Whoa. Wait a minute.

444
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,270
我看过的每部恐怖片里
In every horror movie I've ever seen...

445
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,280
做爱几乎保证了
Having sex pretty much guarantees

446
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,190
我们会死
we will die.

447
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,350
所以为了我们俩的安全
So... for the safety of us both,

448
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,940
我们先忍忍吧
I say we just hold off.

449
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,870
你确定
Are you sure?

450
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,890
你想想  卡塞尔
I mean, think about it, Castle.

451
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,810
这可能是我们最后一次
This could be our last time.

452
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,370
没关系
That's--okay...

453
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,860
你现在做的事
What you're doing right now,

454
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,280
是帮倒忙  而且...
this is not helping. This--

455
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,800
我要走了  远离诱惑
I'm gonna... remove myself from temptation.

456
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,770
好好睡一晚我就能想出好点子了
A good night's sleep will give me some perspective.

457
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,650
我  这...
I--this is...

458
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,300
喂
Hello.

459
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:50,240
韦斯[《惊声尖叫》导演]  我是里奇
Wes. Hey, it's Rick.

460
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,890
天呐  里奇  这大半夜的
Jeez, Rick. It's after midnight.

461
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,960
我知道  抱歉  我需要点建议
Yeah, sorry. I just, um, I need some advice.

462
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,300
打扑克又输给史蒂芬·金了
Is Stephen King beating you at Texas hold'em again?

463
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,300
美著名恐怖小说家

464
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,560
怎么可能
Yeah, right.

465
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,430
不是  其实是关于你的电影
No, but, um, this is actually about your movies.

466
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,600
韦斯·克雷文就是恐怖的代名词
I mean, the name Wes Craven is synonymous with horror.

467
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,600
美国恐怖教父

468
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,480
你靠把大家吓得屁滚尿流赚得盆满钵满
You've made a fortune scaring the crap out of people.

469
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,500
《夺魂盛筵》
"My Soul To Take,"

470
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,000
《猛鬼街》系列
All the "Nightmare On Elm Streets,"

471
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,010
恐怖至极
terrifying.

472
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,500
你半夜给我打电话
So you called me up in the middle of the night

473
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,960
是为了加入我的粉丝会吗
to join my fan club, what?

474
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,010
当然不是
Ha ha. No.

475
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,760
我知道你为你所有影片中
I know that you've researched evil spirits

476
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,750
来自地府的幽灵都做过调查
who reach out from the beyond for all your films.

477
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,930
当然
Of course.

478
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,570
我只是好奇你是否知道
I was just wondering if you knew

479
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,710
怎样抵挡这些讨厌鬼
how to stop those pesky suckers.

480
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,120
你是要制作自己的电影吗
Is this you making your own movie?

481
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,240
你在写恐怖片剧本吗
I mean, are you writing a horror screenplay?

482
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,390
对
Yes.

483
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,670
我只是想跟你良性竞争一下
I just thought I'd give you a little friendly competition.

484
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:40,190
只是遇到了瓶颈
Just got a little writer's block is all.

485
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,660
好吧  什么故事
Okay, what's the story?

486
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,200
粗犷英俊的男主角
Um... ruggedly handsome hero

487
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,330
和他十分不讲迷信的女友
and his notoriously practical lady friend

488
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,210
看了张据说会在三天内杀死观看者的光碟
watch a disc that's killing its viewers within three days.

489
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,700
是吗  你不觉得这缺乏创意吗
Really? You don't think that's a little derivative?

490
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,750
是的  可我希望结局别出心裁
Yes, but I am hoping to distinguish the ending,

491
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,780
故事最后  主角都活了下来
You know, make the third act a, um, survival tale

492
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,580
而不是全都死光
rather than a bloodbath.

493
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,020
我只是想不出
I just can't... figure out

494
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,140
怎么让主角脱离危险
how to get my heroes out of this mess.

495
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,540
关键总是在于鬼怪的原始故事
So the key is always in the spirit's origin story.

496
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,260
一旦你找到出处
Once you have that,

497
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,880
就能开始找出鬼怪的弱点
you can start to figure out the spirit's weaknesses.

498
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,700
如果它使用光碟作为进入我们世界的大门
If it's using the disc as its portal into our world...

499
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,520
那光碟也会包含种种
Then the disc would contain clues

500
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,340
鬼怪故事的线索
as to the spirit's story.

501
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,160
韦斯  谢谢
Wes, thank you.

502
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,090
谢谢  听着  哥们  很晚了  我得挂了
Thank you. Listen, buddy, it's late. I gotta go.

503
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,170
良性竞争个鬼啊
Friendly competition, my ass.

504
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,790
你们一定在开玩笑
You guys have gotta be kidding me.

505
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,210
没发现这两个死者的任何关联
We didn't find a single connection between our victims?

506
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,760
没  这两个人风马牛不相干
No, the two were as different as night and day.

507
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,830
杰森是个退休军医
Jason was a retired ex-army doc.

508
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,450
瓦尔是个年轻的曼哈顿广告主管
Val was a young Manhattan ad exec.

509
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,730
瓦尔生在佛罗里达  杰森在爱荷华长大
Val was born in Florida. Jason grew up in Iowa.

510
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,280
他们没共同朋友  也没亲属关系
They didn't share any friends and they weren't family.

511
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,550
杰森的亲人都认不出瓦尔的照片
And none of Jason's relatives recognized Val's photo?

512
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,860
对  而且瓦尔的家人
No, and nobody from Val's family

513
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,340
也都没见过或听过杰森
had ever seen or heard of Jason.

514
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,500
我们还在细查他们的档案
We're still looking through their records,

515
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,600
可目前一无所获
but so far, nothing.

516
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,690
那我们走到死胡同了
So we're at a dead end?

517
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,300
未必
Ah, maybe not.

518
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,780
我想了又想
After much reflection,

519
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,220
发现问题关键在于
I realized the key to solving this

520
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,410
弄清光盘上的故事
is figuring out the story on the DVD.

521
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,470
为了这个目的
To that end,

522
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:05,750
我把一副图像发给了我的"信众"  集思广益
I crowdsourced one of the images to my legion of followers.

523
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:07,400
有人认出来了吗
And someone recognized it?

524
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,220
那还用说
Oh, you betcha.

525
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,520
据炫猫39称
According to be dazzle cats 39,

526
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,660
这就是布伦瑞克旅馆
You're looking at the Brunswick Inn

527
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,100
在坎贝尔港
in port campbell.

528
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:15,990
说对了
Bingo.

529
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,400
瓦尔的信用卡记录显示她于2008年11月
Val's credit card records show that she spent a few nights

530
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,930
在布伦瑞克旅馆住过几晚
at the Brunswick Inn in november 2008.

531
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,720
貌似杰森也在那儿住过
And it looks like Jason crashed there, too,

532
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,200
也是在2008年11月
also in november 2008.

533
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,270
那么两名死者在同一段时间
Okay, so both of our victims stayed at that inn

534
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,470
都在那个旅馆
at the same time.

535
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,490
也许他们俩有一腿
So maybe they were having an affair.

536
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:32,570
2008年的时候  瓦尔24岁
Well, in 2008, Val would've been 24.

537
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,930
杰森66岁  有一腿的话...
Jason would've been 66. An affair would've been--

538
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,510
-恶心  -我刚想说不太可能
- Gross. - I was gonna say unlikely.

539
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,830
看起来不像是有一腿
It doesn't look like an affair.

540
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,990
他们没住同一间房
They stayed in separate rooms.

541
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,040
两名死者当时都在旅馆
Well, the victims were at the inn.

542
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,170
旅馆又出现在碟片上  中间肯定有联系
The inn was on the disc. There's gotta be a connection.

543
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,380
旅馆肯定发生了
The inn must be the place

544
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,680
可怖的闹鬼事件
where some unspeakable horror befell the spirits.

545
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,440
想想吧
Think about it.

546
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,330
《午夜凶铃》《惊魂记》《闪灵》
"The Ring," "Psycho," "The Shining"--

547
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,860
恐怖的旧旅馆
It's when we get to the creepy old motel

548
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:54,160
是一切灵异故事的开始
that everything starts really going south.

549
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:56,940
这里肯定是鬼故事的始发地
So this must the location of the spirit's origin story.

550
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,940
或者瓦尔和杰森在那个旅馆
Or somehow Val and Jason connected with

551
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,110
与人类杀手产生了某种联系
the human killer at that inn.

552
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,380
我的版本更好
My version's better.

553
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,980
你们去查一下布伦瑞克旅馆
Why don't you look into the Brunswick Inn?

554
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,970
看看有什么危险信号  过往罪案
See if there any red flags, past crimes.

555
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,310
我和卡塞尔去坎贝尔港
Castle and I will go to Port Campbell

556
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,380
看能找到什么线索
and see what we can find.

557
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,030
或许我应该  留在这里
Maybe I should... stay here.

558
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:12,870
我是说
I mean,

559
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,650
旅馆只是谜题的一部分
The inn is just one piece of the puzzle.

560
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,620
我要查查视频里的其它影像
I should really check the other images on the video,

561
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,050
看能找到什么线索
see what I can figure out.

562
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,390
你自愿再看一遍视频吗
Whoa. You're volunteering to watch that thing again?

563
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,710
是啊  反正我只能死一次
Yeah. Not like I can get any deader.

564
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:33,180
布伦瑞克旅馆

565
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,830
有人吗
Hello.

566
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,130
看来这里没人
It doesn't look like there's anyone here.

567
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,950
至少在这个世纪  没人来过
Doesn't look like anyone's been here this century.

568
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,360
你不相信卡塞尔那套荒谬的鬼魂理论吧
You're not buying into Castle's spirit craziness,are you?

569
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,590
当然不信
No.

570
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:56,090
你以为我会怕那些老套的篝火故事吗
You think I'm afraid of some old campfire story?

571
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:58,670
-我不是小孩子了  -需要帮忙吗
- I'm a grown-ass man. - Need help?

572
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,410
我解释下
Just so you know,

573
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:06,340
我只是被吓了一下  不是害怕
Um, that was me being startled, not scared.

574
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:09,280
旅馆是你开的吗
You run this place?

575
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,900
开了41年了  但你们来得不巧
41 years now, but you're in the wrong place.

576
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,330
我们旅馆这季不开放
We're closed for the season.

577
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:16,260
我们就问你几个问题
We just need to ask you a few questions.

578
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,770
你认得这两个人吗
Uh, do you recognize these people?

579
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:21,480
瓦尔·巴特勒和杰森·本内特  他们
Val Butler and Jason Bennett-- they--

580
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,760
他们2008年曾留宿在这里
they stayed here back in 2008.

581
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,790
2008年  好久了  来来往往很多人
Long time ago, 2008. Seen a lot of faces come and go.

582
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,050
他们是11月住在这里的
They would've been here in november.

583
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:31,770
你记得那段时间有什么不寻常的事吗
Do you remember anything unusual from that period?

584
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,240
你们知道他们的房号吗
You wouldn't happen to know their room numbers.

585
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,100
知道  213和313
Yeah, uh, 213 and 313.

586
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:42,640
13号房间  那些房间  不是...
THE 13s. Those rooms, they're not...

587
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:45,030
一般的房间
normal rooms.

588
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:49,190
当时留给了法院庭审的涉案人员
They're reserved for people involved in trials at the courthouse,

589
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,600
在1135号区
down at 1135 elm.

590
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,210
1135  跟包裹上的邮政信箱号码一致
1135, that's the same number as the P.O. Box on that package.

591
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,390
那就是了
That's gotta be it, then.

592
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,180
凶手肯定跟08年在法院的庭审
The murders have to be connected to a trial

593
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,710
有一些联系
held at the courthouse in november of '08.

594
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:03,810
08年11月只审了一个案子
There was only one trial took place in november '08.

595
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,130
那是个可怕的案子
It was a terrible thing.

596
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,950
你还记得五年前的庭审吗
You remember a trial from five years ago?

597
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,710
谁都忘不了
No one here can forget.

598
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,620
那可是世纪审判
It was the trial of the century.

599
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,610
那人杀了六个人
That man murdered half a dozen people.

600
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,290
你说的是谁
Who are you talking about?

601
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,850
奈杰尔·马利瑞
Nigel Malloy.

602
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,540
那个连环杀手
The serial killer?

603
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,580
一切都和奈杰尔·马利瑞有关
This is all about Nigel Malloy.

604
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,940
这下都说得通了
It makes perfect sense.

605
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,720
光盘里的钟楼
The clock tower from the DVD

606
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,950
与他受审法院的钟楼是一样的
it's the same clock tower from the courthouse where he was tried.

607
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,500
屋顶和小巷
The rooftop and the alley

608
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,750
是第三第四起凶案的犯罪现场
were the scenes of his third and fourth murders.

609
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,340
然后杰森和瓦尔
Yeah, and Jason and Val--

610
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,490
都是08连环凶杀案的目击证人
both witnesses in his 2008 murder trial.

611
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:39,330
那么奈杰尔·马利瑞一定会报复
Okay, so somehow Nigel Malloy must be taking revenge

612
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:41,630
指证他的人
against the people that testified against him.

613
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,620
但是有一个问题
Uh, yeah, there's only one problem.

614
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,670
奈杰尔·马利瑞已经死了
Nigel Malloy is dead.

615
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,190
三年前死于狱中
He died in prison three years ago.

616
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,090
奈杰尔·马利瑞  人称"死神"
Nigel Malloy -- they called him "The Grim Reaper. "

617
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,230
他的标志性手段是
His signature--

618
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,620
就像我们在视频里看到的灼伤标记
searing symbols like the ones we saw in the video

619
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,140
直接烫在死者的皮肉上
into the flesh of his victims.

620
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,070
原来瓦尔和杰森目击了
Turns out that Val and Jason were witnesses

621
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,970
马利瑞绑架第一起命案的死者艾瑟尔·阿隆佐
to the kidnapping of Malloy's first victim -- Esther Alonzo.

622
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:14,280
他把她从新泽西的游乐园绑架过来
He abducted her from an amusement park in New Jersey.

623
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,500
在地下室里折磨了几天才杀死她
tortured her in his basement for days before killing her.

624
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,460
他让当地警方忙得团团转
He had the local police running around in circles.

625
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,510
他们甚至还抓错了人
They even arrested the wrong guy

626
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,590
在他杀了五个人之后才抓到
before capturing him five bodies later.

627
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,110
考虑到他死在狱中
Well, considering he died in prison,

628
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:28,400
我得说他在这两起凶案的不在场证明成立了
I'd say he has a pretty good alibi for our two murders.

629
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,560
凶手另有其人
It's gotta be someone else.

630
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,410
别那么肯定
Don't be so sure.

631
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:35,310
看看他死前接受采访时
Take a look at what Nigel Malloy said in an interview he did...

632
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,790
说的话
right before he died.

633
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,740
马利瑞先生
So, Mr. Malloy,

634
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,550
你说你相信自己不会死吗
are you saying you actually believe you can't die?

635
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,960
我杀死的人让我深刻洞悉了死亡
My victims gave me unique insight into death,

636
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,780
死亡的秘密
into its secrets.

637
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,330
即使我的肉身毁灭了  灵魂会延续
Even when my body perishes, my essence will continue on.

638
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,490
我会一直活下去
I will continue on.

639
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,640
你看
You see...

640
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,430
死亡仅仅是开始
death is just the beginning.

641
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,760
他为"精神病患者"[惊魂记直译]注入了新含义
That guy gives a whole new meaning to the word "Psycho. "

642
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,750
如果他真的找到了延续灵魂的方法呢
What if he did... find a way to let his spirit live on?

643
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,490
就像那些惊悚片里的杀手
Like the killer in those chucky movies

644
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,720
把灵魂注入傀儡
who transferred his spirit into that spooky doll.

645
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,920
正是如此  只不过这次不是傀儡  是光盘
Exactly, only instead of a doll, It's a DVD.

646
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,910
这就解释了"见者死"的预言
That explains the message "You saw, you die. "

647
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:18,470
目击者看了到他作案所以必须死
The witnesses saw his crimes so they must die.

648
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,110
按照这个逻辑  我们都不会死
Well, then given that logic, we'd both be okay

649
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,320
因为我们不是目击证人
because we're not witnesses.

650
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,840
但你是个警察  我是个警察  助手
But you're a cop. I'm a cop... helper.

651
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,230
我是说  你不觉得一个被判刑的连环杀手
I mean, you don't think a convicted serial killer

652
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,270
会对纽约警局心怀怨恨吗
is gonna have an ax to grind with the NYPD?

653
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,420
卡塞尔  这事跟奈杰尔·马利瑞无关
Castle,  Nigel Malloy is not involved.

654
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,490
他已经死了
He's dead.

655
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:35,430
但或许有别人代替他作案
But someone else might be acting on his behalf.

656
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,300
莱恩  跟坎贝尔港的地区检察官谈谈
Ryan, talk to the D. A. in port campbell.

657
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,580
找到其他那些目击证人  并确保他们的安全
Let's locate those other witnesses and make sure they're safe.

658
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,170
-好的  -法庭记录都被封存了
- Yeah. - The court records were sealed.

659
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:43,330
凶手怎么知道目击证人有哪些
How would the killer know who the witnesses were?

660
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:45,590
等一下
Uh, w-wait a minute.

661
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,450
奈杰尔·马利瑞有个弟弟  叫里奥普
Nigel Malloy had a brother. Leopol

662
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:51,250
地区检察官曾指控他协助处理尸体
The D. A. accused him of helping dispose of the bodies.

663
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,520
是的  辩护人说过
Yes,  the defense said...

664
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,480
奈杰尔的弟弟对他言听计从
that Nigel had an almost hypnotic hold over his brother.

665
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,430
他因为精神错乱被判无罪
He was found not guilty by reason of insanity,

666
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,130
之后被送去了精神病院
and they shipped him off to an asylum.

667
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,240
-他还在里面吗  -我查一下
- Is he still there? - I am checking.

668
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,180
等等  这可有意思了
Wait. This is interesting.

669
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:04,820
什么
What?

670
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,820
他进的那家精神病院  在格林威治村
The asylum that they sent him to,  It's in Greenwich.

671
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,650
瓦尔拿到DVD那天就是去了那里
That's where Val went the day she got the DVD.

672
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,590
她是去见里奥普·马利瑞了
She went to see Leopold Malloy.

673
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:18,600
是的  那位年轻小姐几天前确实来过
Yes, that young lady did stop by a few days ago.

674
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,390
你知道他们谈了什么
Do you have any idea what they might have talked about

675
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,840
或者他对她说了什么话吗
or what he might have said to her?

676
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,160
我恐怕无从知晓  亲爱的
I'm afraid not, dear.

677
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,140
你得亲自询问马利瑞先生了
You'll have to ask Mr. Malloy yourself.

678
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,410
我想冒昧地问一下  就是
You know, not for nothing,  But...

679
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:30,100
他是什么样的  我是说
what's he like? I mean...

680
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:33,660
从有点疯到汉尼拔
on a scale of 1 to Hannibal Lecter,

681
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,530
我们要面对的是怎样一个人
what are we dealing with here?

682
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,100
我很抱歉  但医患保密协议
I'm sorry,  But doctor-patient privilege

683
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,750
不允许我们形容或描述病人的行为
prohibits us from characterizing or describing our patients' behavior.

684
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,010
不  没关系  我们理解
No, that's okay. We understand.

685
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,630
到了
Here we are.

686
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,160
我们来讲一下规定
Let's go over the rules.

687
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,530
请不要给他任何东西  
Please don't hand him any objects

688
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:50,270
也不要收他的任何东西
or take anything from him.

689
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,850
别站得离玻璃太近
Don't stand too close to the glass.

690
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:52,880
如果你们需要任何帮助
And if you need any help,

691
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,300
就按一下身后墙上的红色按钮
just press the red button on the wall behind you.

692
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,230
好了  请在这里签字
Okay, now please just sign here

693
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,400
以示你们明白了规定
acknowledging that you understand the rules.

694
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,180
我感觉就像签字把命卖了一样
I feel like I'm signing my life away.

695
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,220
但愿不会吧
Well, let's hope not.

696
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,570
谢谢
Thank you.

697
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:25,370
请  坐吧  很少有人会来探望我
Please... have a seat. I so rarely receive visitors.

698
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:31,000
但最近就有个人来探望过你
But you have received a visitor recently.

699
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:35,230
瓦尔·巴特勒  她为什么来找你
Val Butler. Why was she here?

700
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:36,770
甜美的好姑娘
Oh, sweet girl.

701
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:39,050
她跑来问我有没有寄东西给她
She came to ask me if I'd sent her something.

702
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,610
那你寄了吗
And did you?

703
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,960
我怎么能寄  我没办法寄任何东西给任何人
How could I? I can't send anything to anyone.

704
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:46,410
你可以让别人寄给她
You could've just gotten someone else to send it to her,

705
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:49,100
就像你可以派别人去杀了她一样
just like you could've gotten someone else to kill her.

706
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,890
我为什么要那么做
And why would I do such a thing?

707
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:57,270
为了延续你哥哥永生的神秘
To perpetuate the myth of your brother's immortality...

708
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,360
或者为他的死复仇
or to avenge his death.

709
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:06,280
我不是我哥哥的守护人  贝克特探长
I am not my brother's keeper, Detective Beckett.

710
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:11,580
我从来都不是  我没有他那种杀人的冲动
I never was, and I don't share his murderous impulses.

711
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,510
但你却仍然被关在这里
Yet, you're still in here.

712
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,650
暂时而已
For now.

713
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,710
但等到我的上诉结果出来  谁知道呢
But when my appeal comes through, who knows?

714
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,590
我们某天可能会在大街上相遇哦
We could all meet on the street one day.

715
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,130
真有那一天  我可能会穿过街去
On that day, I might cross the street.

716
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:25,740
我不会伤害任何人  从来不会
I'm no danger to anyone. I never was.

717
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:30,180
我为什么要参与谋杀案  毁了自己的上诉呢
So why would I jeopardize my appeal by being party to a murder?

718
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,970
因为你很清楚你可以脱罪
Because you knew you could get away with it.

719
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,280
你被关起来了
You're locked up.

720
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,000
你拥有完美的不在场证明
You have the perfect alibi.

721
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,400
我拥有完美的不在场证明  因为我是无辜的
I have the perfect alibi because I'm innocent.

722
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,530
我没有电视或网络
I don't have TV or internet access.

723
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:53,250
我没有发送或接收邮件
I don't send or receive mail.

724
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,330
我唯一和外界的接触就是访客
The only personal contact I have is through visitors,

725
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:59,520
瓦尔是我多年来最后一个访客
And Val is the last one I've had in years.

726
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,550
我能派谁去杀死她
So who could I have sent to dispatch her

727
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,260
或其他目击证人啊
or the other witness?

728
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,740
我们从没提过
Uh, well, we never actually

729
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,000
其他目击证人被杀
said anything about the other witness being killed.

730
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,350
那么  你是怎么知道这事的
So... how would you know anything about that?

731
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,220
我觉得你们该走了
I think it's time for you to go.

732
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,690
我没什么好说的了
I have nothing more to say.

733
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,220
听着  他已经坦白一切了
Look, he told us everything.

734
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,430
他不小心说漏嘴证明
That slipup proves that

735
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:30,870
他一直在跟某人交流关于那些凶案的信息
he's been talking with someone about those murders.

736
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,550
他还有一种方式可以知道那些信息
There is one other way he could've gotten that information.

737
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,200
他可能跟他哥哥交流过
He could be talking to his brother.

738
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,340
卡塞尔  他肯定是跟外面的人谈过
Castle, he was talking with someone on the outside.

739
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,080
他不可能和死人交流
He hasn't been communing with the dead.

740
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,180
我们可不敢完全确定  而且
Well, we can't be sure, and...

741
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,790
我们没有时间了
We're running out of time.

742
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:46,370
我会把我遗愿清单上的第27条划掉
So I'm gonna scratch off number 27 on my bucket list.

743
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:49,570
你记得你家餐桌上的
You remember that, uh, blue porcelain vase

744
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:50,800
那个蓝色瓷花瓶吗
you had on your dining room table?

745
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,360
当然  就是被风卷进来摔碎的那个
Yeah, the one that the wind blew over.

746
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,650
是啊  关于那个
Yeah, about that.

747
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,300
我当时在客厅打网球游戏
I was playing wii tennis in the living room,

748
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,410
-你打碎了我的瓷瓶  -花瓶
- You broke my vase? - Vase.

749
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,770
-说瓷瓶也可以啦  -你知道吗
- Vase is acceptable, too. - You know what?

750
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,630
你可以不用担心那些鬼魂缠上你了
You can stop worrying about the spirits getting to you,

751
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,220
因为我有可能会亲手杀了你
because I just might kill you myself.

752
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,360
不是吧你  要在我们生命的最后一天吵架吗
Seriously, you want to spend Our last day on earth fighting?

753
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,240
莱恩
Ryan.

754
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,450
你去弄张传票  查看那所精神病院的记录
Hey, we need you to subpoena records from the asylum.

755
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:17,200
看看里奥普通过电话或邮件跟谁联系过
See who Leopold was in contact with by phone or over e-mail.

756
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,940
好的  但是  我想告诉你  
Yeah, sure, but just so you know,

757
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,150
案子有了点新进展
there's been a development.

758
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:23,200
你什么意思  什么新进展
What do you mean? What kind of a development?

759
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,820
我们在查马利瑞家族的信息时
Well, while looking into the Malloys,

760
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,970
在一份警方报告中发现了奈杰尔的名字
Nigel's name came up on a police report.

761
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,480
什么报告
What kind of a report?

762
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,840
报告上声称他几天前失踪了
He was, um... reported missing a few days ago.

763
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,210
失踪  那家伙已经死了超过3年了
Missing? The guy has been dead for over three years.

764
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:40,600
关于那一点  
Yeah, about that...

765
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,970
奈杰尔死后所葬入墓地的看守人
the groundskeeper at the cemetery where Nigel is buried

766
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:44,960
注意到他的坟墓被侵扰过
noticed that his plot has been disturbed.

767
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,960
你是说被挖了吗
As in "dug up"?

768
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,760
不仅是被挖了
Well, not just dug up.

769
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:51,790
尸体失踪

770
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:52,270
奈杰尔·马利瑞的尸体失踪了
Nigel Malloy's body has disappeared.

771
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,180
那不是消失了
It hasn't disappeared.

772
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,660
他是死而复生了
He's risen from the grave.

773
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,840
臭名昭著的连环杀手尸体被盗

774
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,410
我们来听听
All right. Let's hear it.

775
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,140
听什么
Hear what?

776
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,510
你来解释一下这个
Your explanation for this.

777
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:12,950
如果说有什么我可以永远信赖
If there's one thing I can always count on,

778
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:15,210
那就是你和你的推理能力  所以嘛
It's you and your logic so...

779
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,420
你要我解释已故连环杀手的尸体怎么失踪了
You want me to explain the dead serial killer's missing body?

780
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,600
我不知道怎么回事
I don't know what happened here

781
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,070
暂时不知道
yet.

782
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,900
我擦  这也行
That's it? That's all you've got?

783
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,470
但我肯定这案子和奈杰尔·马利瑞复活
But I can assure you that it has nothing to do

784
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,420
没有一点关系
with Nigel Malloy rising from the dead.

785
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,860
是他弟弟
It's his brother.

786
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,700
里奥普·马利瑞才是幕后黑手
Leopold Malloy is behind all of this.

787
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,460
看来里奥普跟这案子没关系
It doesn't look like Leopold has anything to do with this.

788
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,110
不能吧
No,that can't be right.

789
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,920
这家伙是疯子  可是在一件事上他是对的
Look,the guy's crazy, But he was right about one thing.

790
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,790
他没有电话  电子邮箱  只有瓦尔拜访过他
He has no phone,no e-mail,and no visitors besides Val.

791
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:51,710
肯定有办法证明里奥普是幕后黑手
There's gotta be some way of proving that Leopold's behind all this.

792
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,030
我不知道他是怎么做到的
I can't tell you how he did it,

793
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,900
但我知道下一个被害人是谁
but I can tell you who's next.

794
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,920
我查了马利瑞案的法庭记录
I checked into the court documents on the Malloy trial.

795
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,420
发现了些规律  杰森是第一个证人
I noticed a pattern. Jason was the first person to testify,

796
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,970
而他是第一个被害人
and he was also the first one to die.

797
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:03,620
第二天被害的瓦尔  是第二个证人
A day later, Val, the second person who testified, was killed.

798
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,720
好  所以他们是按出庭作证的顺序被害的
Okay, so they're being killed in order of their testimonies.

799
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,850
谁是第三个
Who's lucky number three?

800
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:09,680
马克·海勒  我找了他女友
Uh, Mark Heller. I talked to his girlfriend.

801
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:11,480
他三天前收到了光盘
He received a disc three days ago.

802
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,110
也就是说他今晚午夜会死  还有四小时
That means he's due to die tonight at midnight. That's in four hours.

803
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,350
那马克·海勒现在在哪
And where's Mark Heller now?

804
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,360
不知道
That's the problem.

805
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,750
他看完视频后吓傻了
He watched the video and he freaked out.

806
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,280
他离开了家  没人知道去哪儿
He left the house. Nobody knows where he went.

807
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,820
我知道  海勒的消费记录显示
I might. Heller's financials show that

808
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,360
他昨天在金斯敦市外的商店买了东西
he bought groceries at a store outside Kingston yesterday.

809
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,810
他们家在那儿有间小屋
His family owns a Cabin up there.

810
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:25,880
估计他就躲在那儿
That's probably where he's holed up.

811
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,170
好  埃斯波西托  你继续里奥普
Okay, Esposito you keep digging into Leopold.

812
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:30,320
莱恩  找出其他证人
Ryan... find the other witnesses.

813
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,550
确保他们安全
Make sure they're safe.

814
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:34,480
我和卡塞尔去金斯敦找海勒
Castle and I will head off to Kingston and see if we can get Heller.

815
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,630
我们要去那个偏僻森林里的小屋吗
Uh, we're going to a cabin in the woods in the middle of nowhere?

816
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,810
对  怎么了
Yeah. So?

817
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:42,510
这就像是恐怖片里女学生去查看
So it's like the co-ed checking out the strange noise in the basement

818
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:44,830
地下室的怪声  这就是惹鬼上身啊
in a slasher pic. It's a recipe for disaster.

819
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:47,510
这又不是演恐怖电影  我们是调查凶案
It's not a slasher flick. It's a murder investigation.

820
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:51,030
我要去那小屋  你跟不跟去
And I'm going up to that cabin. So you coming or what?

821
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,510
我不能让你一个人去
Well, I can't let you go alone.

822
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:56,270
但我得先准备准备
But I need to make a stop first.

823
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:04,160
我带了香火  符咒  照妖镜
Okay, so I've got incense, palaspas, bagua mirror.

824
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,670
全套的驱鬼利器  鬼挡杀鬼  佛挡杀佛
This is a veritable war chest for fighting evil spirits.

825
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,440
-那是圣水吗  -对
- Is that holy water? - Yeah.

826
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,750
你从哪儿弄来的
Where'd you get that from?

827
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,590
两年前  一个教士开光了送我的
A priest blessed this for me two years ago.

828
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,550
你就一直留着吗
And you just keep it around?

829
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,730
我知道总会用得着的
Knew it would come in handy one day.

830
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,910
好  你想要哪样武器
Now... What weapon do you want?

831
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,410
我有枪就行了
I think I'll be fine with my gun.

832
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:24,210
对于我的看法
There's not just one... tiny part of you

833
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,220
你就真的一点也不信吗
that wonders if I might be right?

834
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:36,520
-喂  贝克特  -莱恩
- Hey, Beckett. - Ryan?

835
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,850
喂  贝克特
Hey, Beckett?

836
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,480
莱恩  我们这儿信号不好
Ryan, wh-- I think we're in a bad area.

837
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,020
我听不清你说话
I'm having a hard time hearing you.

838
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,320
好的  那我长话短说
Okay, then I'll make it quick.

839
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,310
我刚找到最后一个证人
I just finished with the last of the remaining witnesses.

840
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,350
他们都没收到光盘
None of them got a disc.

841
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,750
所以凶手只想杀前三个证人
So the killer only targeted the first three witnesses.

842
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:53,650
有可能是这样  也有可能只是还没动手
Well, either that or he hasn't gotten around to the others yet.

843
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:55,250
哥们  我们听不见了
Dude, you're breaking up.

844
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:56,620
先别挂
Uh, uh, hang on.

845
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,000
看看这个
Yo, check this out.

846
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,320
看来瓦尔  杰森和马克·海勒还有别的共同点
Looks like Val, Jason, and Mark Heller had something else in common.

847
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,060
喂  贝克特  我们漏了些事
Hey, Beckett. We missed something.

848
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,110
事情不如我们所料  而是另有乾坤
I-it's not what we think. There's someone else.

849
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,630
贝克特  贝克特
Beckett? Beckett.

850
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,260
联系不上他了  我完全没信号
I can't get him back. I don't have any reception.

851
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,270
那是海勒的车  他在这儿
There's Heller's car. He's here.

852
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,140
嗯  我也完全没信号
Yeah, I haven't got any bars either.

853
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,900
这地方的确比较偏僻
Yeah, well, we are in the middle of nowhere.

854
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,250
还能更糟吗
Can this get any worse?

855
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,770
一个已故连环杀手离奇失踪
A dead serial killer has gone missing,

856
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,770
我俩都看了诅咒光盘
we've both seen a cursed disc,

857
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:32,930
身在阴森的林中小屋  手机又没信号
we're at a cabin in the woods with no cell phone reception--

858
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:35,300
傻子都知道这故事会怎么发展
I don't need Wes Craven to tell me how this ends.

859
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,530
卡塞尔  你得这么想
Well, think about it this way, Castle.

860
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:38,350
在所有恐怖电影里
In all of those horror movies,

861
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,480
-总有人能活下来  -是啊  "有人"而已
- someone survives. - Yeah, someone.

862
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,560
我俩中的一人
One of us.

863
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,820
我们中的一人天生风趣幽默
And the other one is cursed with being charming and funny.

864
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,100
用不着我来告诉你
I don't think I need to tell you

865
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,620
那些搞笑的角色都是什么下场
what kind of chances the comic relief guy has.

866
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:53,230
马克·海勒
Mark Heller.

867
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:57,110
马克·海勒
Mark Heller?

868
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:01,220
哎呀妈呀
Jeez.

869
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,790
这装饰太吓人了
Can't say I'm a fan of the decor.

870
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,160
我也不喜欢  可我们是来
Yeah, well, neither am I, but we're just here to--

871
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,910
你们要是不走  那就死定了
Unless you leave, you're gonna die.

872
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,730
海勒先生  我是贝克特探长  纽约警局的
Mr Heller, I'm Detective Beckett. NYPD.

873
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:13,710
那你不介意出示你的证件吧
Well, then you won't mind showing me I.D.

874
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:20,930
我必须保持警惕
I can't be too cautious,

875
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:23,650
马利瑞案的证人都离奇身亡
Not with Malloy witnesses dropping like flies.

876
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:25,500
我们知道光盘的事
Look, we know about the disc.

877
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,030
我们是来带你回去的  以便保护你
We're here to take you to the precinct, where we can protect you.

878
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,040
你们保护不了我  他回来了
You can't protect me. He's back.

879
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,180
马克  按照推断  你还有两分钟就...
Look, Mark, if the pattern holds, you got two minutes before...

880
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,420
你懂的  所以我们上车再说吧
you know, so let's talk about this in the car.

881
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:41,210
你知道吗  跟马利瑞待在同一个审判室
You know, just being in the same courtroom as Malloy

882
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:43,370
就足以让大老爷们尿裤子了
was enough to make a grown man wet himself.

883
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:46,860
那个疯子成天嚷嚷些装神弄鬼的
Psycho yammering about death and rebirth and all that hoo-ha.

884
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,400
我们可以上车了聊
Okay, hoo-ha we could be talking about--

885
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,030
其实我  瓦尔和杰森
You know, neither me nor Val nor Jason

886
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:53,530
都不想指证他和其他同伙
wanted to testify against him or the other guy.

887
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:54,990
什么其他同伙
What do you mean,the other guy?

888
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:56,780
你是说里奥普吗
Are you talking about Leopold?

889
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,840
-老天爷  -时辰到
- Oh, god. - Time's up.

890
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,160
它来了
It's here.

891
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,180
你觉得它会让我俩再活一天吗
Do you think it'll matter that we still have a day left

892
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,870
还是干脆一次把我们仨都干掉
or will I be like a three birds with one stone thing?

893
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,270
你家电闸在哪儿
Where are your circuit breakers?

894
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:20,850
-在工具房外  -好
- Outside by the toolshed. - Okay.

895
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,210
有人在外面
Someone's out there.

896
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,890
当真吗  它长啥样
Seriously? What's it like?

897
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:32,520
是个幽灵吗  脸色惨白吗  怒火中烧吗
Is it, uh, ghastly, pale, pissed?

898
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,420
我看不清他的脸
I can't get a good look at his face.

899
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,350
你家有后门吗
Do you have a back door?

900
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:36,780
有有  穿过厨房就是
Yeah, yeah. Through the kitchen.

901
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,310
卡塞尔  你守着马克
Okay, Castle, you keep an eye on Mark.

902
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,590
我出去看看
I'm gonna head out back,

903
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:43,050
我从后面迂回过去  给他个突然袭击
Double around, see if I can surprise him.

904
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,320
什么  等一下  我们分头行动
What? Wait. We're splitting up?

905
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,070
是的
Yeah.

906
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,400
纽约警察  站在那儿别动
NYPD. Hold it right there.

907
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,810
他就不能放过我们吗
Why can't he just leave us alone?

908
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:24,090
我们已经很倒霉了
We suffered so much already.

909
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,100
内疚已经快把我们三个折磨死了
The guilt nearly killed the three of us.

910
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,010
你们把那个连环杀手定了罪
Why would you have guilt

911
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:28,950
为什么要感到内疚呢
about getting a serial killer convicted?

912
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,230
因为那不是事情的全部
Because that's not the whole story.

913
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,480
我们的手上也沾有鲜血
We all have blood on our hands.

914
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,850
鲜血  什么鲜血
Blood? What blood?

915
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,810
马克  跟我说说  我需要知道
Mark, talk to me. I need to know.

916
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:42,510
你说的鲜血是什么意思
What blood is on your hands?

917
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,660
有关系吗
What does it matter?

918
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,810
他回来找我们算账了  我们都得死
He's come back for us. We're all gonna die.

919
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:47,530
如果是因为你做错了什么的话
It matters because if you did something wrong,

920
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:50,020
这可能就是我们活着出去的关键
it could be the key to getting out of this alive.

921
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:00,660
放开我  放开我
Get off of me! Let me go!

922
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,930
是你  里奥普的护士
You? Leopold's nurse.

923
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,740
-里奥普  是你干的  -不
- Leopold. It was you. - No.

924
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,820
不  不是
No. No.

925
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:12,290
-是你帮他杀人的  -不  不是的
- You're the one that's killing for him. - No,no.

926
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:13,570
你不明白
You don't understand.

927
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:16,130
怪不得他能接近那些证人  他是利用你
That's how he got to the witnesses. He was using you.

928
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,650
你搞错了
You don't get it.

929
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:20,070
我不是来这杀海勒的  我是来救他的
I'm not here to kill Heller. I'm here to save him.

930
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,500
你在说些什么啊
What are you even talking about?

931
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,100
-这就是里奥普派我来的原因  -退后
- That's why Leopold sent me. - Step back.

932
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,060
-好的  好的  -退后
- Okay.Okay. All right. - Step back.

933
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:28,210
他知道别人会以为他是凶手
He knew that people would think that he was behind the murders,

934
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,430
那样的话他就永远无法离开精神病院
And then he wouldn't be able to get out of the asylum.

935
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,690
我爱他  我只是想帮他
I love him. I was just trying to protect him.

936
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:37,130
我们知道我们必须得阻止这些谋杀
We knew we had to stop the murders.

937
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,100
不是我们干的  我发誓
It--it's not us. I swear.

938
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,580
如果不是你们  那会是谁
If it's not you, then who is it?

939
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,440
我不知道
I don't know,

940
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:46,310
但我去了奈杰尔的坟墓想确认一下
but I went to Nigel's grave just to be sure.

941
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:50,580
我把坟墓挖开了  他不见了
I dug it up. He was gone.

942
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:56,470
不  死人不会杀人
No. Evil spirits don't kill.

943
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,260
活人才会
People do.

944
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,850
在奈杰尔之前  警察还逮捕了别人
Before Nigel, The police arrested someone else--

945
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,390
大卫·克里尔
David Collier.

946
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,610
那人有精神病史
Guy had a history of mental illness.

947
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:10,470
我  瓦尔和杰森把他指认出来了
Me, Val, and Jason had to pick him out of a lineup.

948
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:13,050
我们都不确定  但是警察  他们
None of us were sure. But the police, they...

949
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,400
他们迫使你们不得不说是克里尔干的
They pressured you into saying it was Collier.

950
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,410
他后来怎样了
What happened to him?

951
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:24,840
他承受不了那些指控  还有人们的议论
He couldn't take it-- the accusations, what people were saying.

952
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,040
他把牢房里的灯打碎了
He smashed a lightbulb in his cell

953
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,890
然后触电自杀了
and he used the wire to electrocute himself.

954
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:32,410
这么说他死了
So his heart stopped.

955
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:36,110
他什么时候死的  马克  准确时间
When did he die? Mark, exactly when did he die?

956
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:38,110
他入狱后第三天的午夜
At midnight, third night he was in prison.

957
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:41,200
"你看见了  三天后的午夜你就会死"
"You saw. Midnight third day, you die. "

958
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,800
跟奈杰尔没关系  是跟克里尔有关
This isn't about Nigel. It's about Collier.

959
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,650
马克  你得想想
Mark, you gotta think.

960
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,450
他有没有什么朋友或者家人
Did he have any friends, any relatives?

961
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:51,260
是的  他有一个女儿  阿曼达
Yeah, he had a daughter. Amanda.

962
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:53,890
瓦尔的室友叫阿曼达
Val's roommate's name is Amanda.

963
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,270
有人来了
Someone's here.

964
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,660
你三天的时间到了  马克
Your three days are up, Mark.

965
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,860
我父亲也同样承受了三天的恐惧
The same three days of fear my father had.

966
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,680
站住  别动
Stop... Right there.

967
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,800
我看不见了
Right in my eyes!

968
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:41,220
枪  我看不见  她在哪
The gun! I can't see. Where is she?

969
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:45,540
这是为我父亲报仇
This is for my father.

970
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,810
卡塞尔
Castle!

971
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,180
看见了吧
See?

972
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:56,010
我就说这瓶圣水会派上用场
Told you this holy water would come in handy.

973
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:02,680
根据阿曼达的心理评估记录
So according to Amanda's psych records,

974
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,610
她一年前经受了一次精神创伤
she suffered a mental break about a year ago.

975
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:08,350
她一定是从那时开始准备复仇的
That must be when she started fixating on revenge.

976
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:12,010
计划着要惩罚所有错误指认了他父亲的人
Plannign to punish all those who wrongly I.D.'ed her dad.

977
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,550
她一定是拼命讨好瓦尔
You know, she must have cozied up to Val

978
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:16,150
从而找到了杰森和马克
to find out where Jason and Mark were.

979
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:19,160
还有  她用这个把他们撂倒了
And... she used this to knock them out.

980
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,350
杯子
The mug?

981
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:23,440
不  是电击枪  改造过了
No, the taser. It's a modified taser.

982
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,100
它能释放出令人眩晕的光线和加大的电压
It emits a disorienting light and amplified voltage.

983
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,840
足以使心脏停止跳动的电压
Enough voltage to stop a heart.

984
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,740
而且还能使面部肌肉收缩
And make the facial muscles contract.

985
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,450
我想阿曼达是想要那些对他父亲的死
I guess Amanda wanted the people responsible For her father's death

986
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:34,170
负有责任的人承受和他父亲一样的痛苦
to suffer the same way he did.

987
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:36,120
也就是三天的恐惧
So three days of fear

988
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,970
最后在黑暗中  心脏停跳而死去
capped up with a dark, heart-stopping death.

989
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,460
但是她是怎么造成停电的呢
Yeah, but how did she get the power to go out?

990
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,750
她用的这个
She used this.

991
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,000
她把这个连在小屋的断路器上
She attached it to the cabin's circuit breaker.

992
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,810
它释放出的磁荷
It emits a magnetic charge

993
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:48,920
影响了电路系统
that interferes with the system.

994
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:53,450
所以说  所有的事都有合乎逻辑的解释
So... I guess that there is a logical explanation for everything.

995
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:56,010
说不好  奈杰尔的事怎么说
Oh,I don't know. What about Nigel?

996
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:57,990
他的尸体怎么会从坟墓里不见了呢
How did his body go missing from his grave?

997
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:59,150
我来回答吧
I can answer that.

998
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:01,320
原来他从没被下葬
Turns out he was never buried.

999
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,700
他的尸体在他死后不久就从太平间消失了
His body disappeared from the morgue shortly after his death.

1000
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,410
警察不想让别人知道
The police didn't want to make it known,

1001
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:08,520
所以就埋了一个空棺材
So they buried an empty coffin.

1002
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:12,160
但奇怪的是  他的尸体一直没被找到
But here's the odd thing-- his body was never found.

1003
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:16,690
这么说  他可能仍然在
So... he could still be out there...

1004
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:18,220
某个地方
somewhere.

1005
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:29,790
这杯庆祝我们出色地完成了任务
Okay,so... here's to a job well done.

1006
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:35,460
你现在终于可以扔掉你的这份
And now you can finally get rid of this bucket... list

1007
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:37,050
遗愿清单了
of yours.

1008
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:38,660
怎么这个表情
What's that look for?

1009
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,620
"跟凯特在一起"
"Be with Kate"?

1010
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,530
排在第一个  你什么时候写的
That's your number one? When did you write this?

1011
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:44,180
差不多三年前吧
What, like three years ago?

1012
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:46,420
现在我可以把这条划去了
I can cross that one off.

1013
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,870
抱歉  还有一分钟才到午夜
Sorry. Still one minute till midnight.

1014
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:57,260
你没搞错吧  卡塞尔
Are you serious, Castle?

1015
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,580
没有  我认真的  我可不想冒险
Yes, I'm serious. I'm not taking any chances.

1016
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,800
我真的很想错过这个死期
This is one deadline I want to miss.

1017
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,690
你说的对
You know, you're right.

1018
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:04,910
要是我们俩有什么三长两短真的很遗憾
It would be a shame if something happened to us

1019
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:07,410
因为我的遗愿清单上也有一件
because there's one thing on my bucket list

1020
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:09,260
我很想完成的事
that I would like to accomplish.

1021
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,840
而且这事还跟我玩弄冰块
And it involves a little trick that I do...

1022
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,110
有关
with ice.

1023
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:16,590
你看  就冲这事儿我们也得活着
See, now that definitely sounds worth living for.

1024
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:21,670
卡塞尔  冰块可要化了哦
Hey, Castle... the ice is melting.

1025
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:24,060
好的  就  倒计时
Okay, ju--I just-- In...

1026
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:27,780
三  二
three, two...
