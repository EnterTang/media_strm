Part Five

30
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:10,566
Just imagine a square
in front of a cathedral.

31
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:13,319
Flame and smoke.

32
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:17,406
The cardinal, the Grand Inquisitor
looks at the fire,

33
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:22,369
where heretics must be burnt
by his order.

34
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:29,584
Fifteen centuries have passed
since He promised to come.

35
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:34,380
Fifteen centuries the humanity prayed :
'God, come to us! '

36
00:03:34,588 --> 00:03:38,425
And here He decided to come down
to the people.

37
00:03:38,592 --> 00:03:43,513
In His infinite mercy
He came once more among men

38
00:03:43,596 --> 00:03:50,353
in that human shape in which He walked
among men fifteen centuries ago.

39
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,315
The air is 'fragrant
with laurel and lemon.'

40
00:03:56,608 --> 00:04:00,445
And here He comes.

41
00:04:17,461 --> 00:04:19,338
Take him!

42
00:05:09,634 --> 00:05:12,303
I don't quite understand.

43
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:15,431
They recognized Him
and put Him in a prison?

44
00:05:15,514 --> 00:05:17,474
What does it mean?
An inquisitor's mistake?

45
00:05:18,517 --> 00:05:24,481
You are so corrupted by modern realism
and can't stand anything fantastic.

46
00:05:25,565 --> 00:05:28,526
Just listen.

47
00:05:46,626 --> 00:05:49,545
Is that you?

48
00:05:50,338 --> 00:05:52,506
I see it is you.

49
00:05:54,508 --> 00:05:56,468
Why did you come?

50
00:06:05,393 --> 00:06:08,354
Christ doesn't say a word.

51
00:06:10,356 --> 00:06:11,524
That is what supposed to be.

52
00:06:14,568 --> 00:06:18,322
You do not deign me worthy
of even a word of reproach.

53
00:06:20,324 --> 00:06:22,451
I want to make you free.

54
00:06:22,534 --> 00:06:25,495
You have been saying that
for fifteen hundred years.

55
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:31,584
They have brought their freedom to us
and laid it humbly at our feet.

56
00:06:32,376 --> 00:06:34,545
Now they are sure
they are completely free.

57
00:06:35,337 --> 00:06:36,547
We are completely free?

58
00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:38,382
Is it freedom?

59
00:06:38,424 --> 00:06:40,425
The old man is ironical.

60
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:42,344
Not a bit of it!

61
00:06:42,386 --> 00:06:45,555
He claims it as a merit for himself that
at last they have vanquished freedom

62
00:06:46,348 --> 00:06:47,557
and have done so to make men happy.

63
00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:51,310
Because people need
bread, not freedom.

64
00:06:51,394 --> 00:06:54,355
But in Gospel devil says those words.

65
00:06:58,359 --> 00:07:02,321
Fifteen centuries ago
the spirit of desert showed you

66
00:07:02,404 --> 00:07:05,365
how to make people happy.

67
00:07:05,448 --> 00:07:07,409
And you denied it.

68
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:10,370
You didn't deprive man of freedom

69
00:07:10,411 --> 00:07:12,580
And didn't turn stones into bread.

70
00:07:13,331 --> 00:07:16,417
And with words
'Feed men, and then ask of them virtue! '

71
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,586
they raised against you,
and with which they destroyed your temple.

72
00:07:20,337 --> 00:07:24,466
Trying to make them free
you did something like you didn't love them.

73
00:07:24,549 --> 00:07:29,387
And having tired of that freedom
they came to us.

74
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:34,392
And they said 'Enslave us, but feed us.'

75
00:07:34,475 --> 00:07:37,311
And they bowed down before us.

76
00:07:43,442 --> 00:07:45,402
You didn't expect that.

77
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,570
You were expecting free love.

78
00:07:48,321 --> 00:07:51,574
And those creatures
just want to bow down before anyone.

79
00:07:52,325 --> 00:07:54,452
They are weak and mean.

80
00:07:54,493 --> 00:07:59,373
And sometimes they remember their freedom
and they can revolt against the power

81
00:07:59,456 --> 00:08:01,458
and to flood earth with blood.

82
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:06,546
But when all rebellious destroy each others,
the rest will crawl up to us.

83
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:10,383
And they would ask
'Save us from ourselves! '

84
00:08:10,466 --> 00:08:15,388
For only there are three forces
which can make one happy.

85
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:20,309
This is miracle, mystery and authority.

86
00:08:20,517 --> 00:08:22,394
That's absurd!

87
00:08:22,477 --> 00:08:26,356
There could not be such
a fantastic creature as your Inquisitor.

88
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:33,404
To lead people by the Christ’s name,
but by the Devil’s way.

89
00:08:33,488 --> 00:08:37,575
And what are these sins of mankind
they take on themselves?

90
00:08:38,367 --> 00:08:40,411
They don't even believe in God.

91
00:08:40,452 --> 00:08:42,496
That's Rome,
and not even the whole of Rome,

92
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:45,373
it's false-those are the worst
of the Catholics the Inquisitors!

93
00:08:49,544 --> 00:08:51,546
How does your poem end?

94
00:08:52,463 --> 00:08:54,423
Or was it the end?

95
00:08:55,383 --> 00:08:58,344
I meant to end it like this.

96
00:08:58,385 --> 00:09:00,346
When the Inquisitor ceased speaking

97
00:09:00,471 --> 00:09:02,598
he waited some time
for his Prisoner to answer him.

98
00:09:05,475 --> 00:09:07,352
But he is silent.

99
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,546
Say just a word.

100
00:09:38,297 --> 00:09:39,548
Even the worse one.

101
00:10:00,317 --> 00:10:02,319
Go.

102
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,404
And never come back.

103
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:17,333
Never come back.

104
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:20,419
Never.

105
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:25,299
Your Grand Inquisitor
doesn't have any secrets.

106
00:10:25,465 --> 00:10:28,343
He just doesn't believe in God.
That's his secret!

107
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,512
Enough of it.

108
00:10:31,304 --> 00:10:34,348
I might be an
author impatient of your criticism.

109
00:10:34,432 --> 00:10:38,436
But still you are right.
My Grand Inquisitor doesn't believe in God.

110
00:10:38,561 --> 00:10:41,271
You don't believe in God.

111
00:10:41,522 --> 00:10:44,441
Why do you take it so serious?

112
00:10:44,483 --> 00:10:46,276
Why, it's all nonsense.

113
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,320
It's only a senseless poem
of a senseless student,

114
00:10:48,361 --> 00:10:51,322
who could never write
two lines of verse.

115
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,409
Let us go. I have to go.

116
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:05,419
Leaves, blue sky, your woman. How can you
love them with that hell in your head?

117
00:11:05,502 --> 00:11:08,338
There is a strength to endure everything.

118
00:11:08,421 --> 00:11:09,547
What strength?

119
00:11:10,298 --> 00:11:11,466
The strength of the Karamazovs.

120
00:11:11,508 --> 00:11:14,302
To sink into debauchery?

121
00:11:14,344 --> 00:11:15,553
Possibly even that.

122
00:11:16,345 --> 00:11:18,305
Only perhaps till I am thirty
I shall escape it, and then...

123
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:19,473
Everything is lawful,' you mean?

124
00:11:19,598 --> 00:11:21,558
Ah, you've caught up yesterday's phrase,

125
00:11:22,351 --> 00:11:24,561
which so offended Miusov -
and which Dmitri pounced upon.

126
00:11:25,354 --> 00:11:26,480
Yes, if you like.

127
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:28,315
Everything is lawful.

128
00:11:31,484 --> 00:11:34,445
I thought that going away
from here I have you at least.

129
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:38,449
But now I see that there is no place
for me even in your heart.

130
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:43,370
The formula, 'all is lawful,'
I won't renounce.

131
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,373
I won't renounce.

132
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:51,544
Will you renounce me for that, yes?

133
00:12:00,427 --> 00:12:03,305
That's plagiarism.

134
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,557
You stole that from my poem.

135
00:12:12,313 --> 00:12:17,276
If I am really able
to care for the sticky little leaves

136
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,403
I shall only love
them, remembering you.

137
00:12:20,362 --> 00:12:23,490
Take it as
a declaration of love if you like.

138
00:12:24,533 --> 00:12:27,411
Don't say a word more on these subjects.

139
00:12:27,494 --> 00:12:30,288
And about Dmitri too,
never speak to me again.

140
00:12:31,331 --> 00:12:33,541
It has all been said.

141
00:12:35,335 --> 00:12:36,544
Good-bye.

142
00:12:48,388 --> 00:12:51,349
I am going downstairs to my room.

143
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:16,482
Send someone for the horses
in the morning.

144
00:15:16,566 --> 00:15:18,526
I'm leaving for Moscow for good.

145
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:27,326
What a fellow you are!

146
00:15:30,287 --> 00:15:33,290
Never mind.

147
00:15:37,418 --> 00:15:40,254
Listen, Ivan.

148
00:15:40,338 --> 00:15:41,547
Do me a great service.

149
00:15:43,257 --> 00:15:45,384
Go to Tchermashnya on the way.

150
00:15:46,385 --> 00:15:48,428
It's only to turn to the left from the station,

151
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:52,224
only another twelve versts
and you come to Tchermashnya.

152
00:15:52,307 --> 00:15:55,310
It's eighty versts to the railway and the
train starts at seven o'clock tonight.

153
00:15:55,393 --> 00:15:56,352
I can only just catch it.

154
00:15:56,436 --> 00:15:58,479
You'll catch it tomorrow.

155
00:15:58,563 --> 00:16:02,316
It won't put you out much
to humour your father!

156
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,487
You see,
I've two pieces of copse land there.

157
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,323
The priest at Ilyinskoe wrote to me.

158
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:13,535
A merchant called Gorstkin, had turned up.

159
00:16:14,411 --> 00:16:16,454
He wants to buy it.

160
00:16:16,496 --> 00:16:19,373
He will give me
eleven thousand for the cops.

161
00:16:19,457 --> 00:16:24,461
I just want to know
whether he is lying or speaking the truth.

162
00:16:25,296 --> 00:16:27,423
I shall be no use in such a business.
I have no eye either.

163
00:16:27,506 --> 00:16:31,551
I will tell you the signs
by which you can judge about him.

164
00:16:32,302 --> 00:16:34,304
Sit down.

165
00:16:34,387 --> 00:16:35,472
Listen.

166
00:16:35,555 --> 00:16:40,476
You see, you must watch his beard.

167
00:16:42,311 --> 00:16:47,441
If his beard shakes
when he talks and he gets cross,

168
00:16:47,524 --> 00:16:50,485
it's all right, he is saying
what he means, he wants to do business.

169
00:16:50,485 --> 00:16:55,407
But if he strokes his
beard with his left hand and grins -

170
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,450
he is trying to cheat you.

171
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:01,370
Only let me know it's serious,

172
00:17:01,495 --> 00:17:03,330
and I'll run over and fix it up.

173
00:17:03,372 --> 00:17:05,332
I can't spare the time.
You must excuse me.

174
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:09,294
You've no heart, any of you!

175
00:17:10,337 --> 00:17:15,508
You force me to go to that damned
Tchermashnya yourself, then?

176
00:17:20,304 --> 00:17:22,431
Welcome, my dear.

177
00:17:23,307 --> 00:17:25,476
Have you seen your brother?

178
00:17:26,352 --> 00:17:28,520
To whom I bowed down.

179
00:17:36,528 --> 00:17:38,446
I could not find him today.

180
00:17:38,529 --> 00:17:42,366
Make haste to find him.
Leave everything and make haste.

181
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:45,494
Perhaps you may still have time
to prevent something terrible.

182
00:17:46,328 --> 00:17:50,332
I bowed down yesterday to the great
suffering in store for him.

183
00:17:50,415 --> 00:17:52,376
Your words are too obscure.

184
00:17:52,501 --> 00:17:54,461
What is this suffering in store for him?

185
00:17:56,379 --> 00:17:59,382
A look came into his eyes -

186
00:17:59,465 --> 00:18:02,385
so that I was instantly horror-stricken

187
00:18:02,468 --> 00:18:06,388
at what that man
is preparing for himself.

188
00:18:06,513 --> 00:18:12,519
Once or twice in my life
I've seen such a look in a man's face,

189
00:18:13,311 --> 00:18:16,439
reflecting as it were his future fate,

190
00:18:16,523 --> 00:18:19,484
and that fate, alas, came to pass.

191
00:18:20,318 --> 00:18:24,405
Maybe your
brotherly face would help him.

192
00:18:26,365 --> 00:18:28,409
Everything is from the Lord.

193
00:18:28,492 --> 00:18:31,245
All our fates.

194
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:35,248
I will get up.

195
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:53,348
Everyone hides what he has, from the rest.

196
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:59,479
And instead of fullness of life
he gets only solitude.

197
00:18:59,562 --> 00:19:03,482
And that will be till
everyone understands

198
00:19:03,566 --> 00:19:13,241
that besides his own sin
he is guilty for any other sin.

199
00:19:13,325 --> 00:19:17,287
But throwing your impotence on others

200
00:19:17,454 --> 00:19:21,416
you will end by murmuring against God.

201
00:19:34,302 --> 00:19:38,223
I now thirst to love,

202
00:19:38,348 --> 00:19:42,310
but my earthly life is over.

203
00:19:42,477 --> 00:19:48,315
And there will be nothing great.

204
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:55,502
You are waiting for a miracle?

205
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,256
It stinks.

206
00:21:00,381 --> 00:21:02,342
God forgive me.

207
00:21:13,477 --> 00:21:16,313
We should open the window.

208
00:21:21,484 --> 00:21:26,364
There was no smell of corruption from the
late elder Varsonofy, but a sweet fragrance.

209
00:21:26,405 --> 00:21:28,240
So here's the miracle.

210
00:21:28,365 --> 00:21:32,327
He was not strict in fasting,
allowed himself sweet things,

211
00:21:32,411 --> 00:21:37,457
ate cherry jam with his tea,
ladies used to send it to him.

212
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:44,255
Not miracles made him great,
but his great love.

213
00:21:45,464 --> 00:21:49,260
It shows God's judgment is not as man's.

214
00:21:53,555 --> 00:21:55,474
Where are you hastening?

215
00:21:56,266 --> 00:21:58,351
The bell calls to service.

216
00:21:59,477 --> 00:22:02,230
Can you be with those of little faith?

217
00:22:11,322 --> 00:22:13,282
Alexey!

218
00:22:35,302 --> 00:22:36,428
What's the matter?

219
00:22:36,511 --> 00:22:38,388
Are you angry?

220
00:22:38,513 --> 00:22:40,515
Let me alone.

221
00:22:41,307 --> 00:22:42,475
So that's how we are feeling!

222
00:22:42,517 --> 00:22:44,477
Can you be so upset because
your old man has begun to stink?

223
00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:47,438
You seriously believed that he
was going to work miracles?

224
00:22:47,521 --> 00:22:49,440
No schoolboy
of thirteen believes in that now.

225
00:22:49,482 --> 00:22:53,443
I believe,
I want to believe, and I will believe.

226
00:22:54,278 --> 00:22:55,529
What more do you want?

227
00:23:05,288 --> 00:23:07,456
The holiest of holy men should have
been exposed to the jeering?

228
00:23:08,332 --> 00:23:10,292
What for? Who had judged him?

229
00:23:11,418 --> 00:23:13,462
And this is 'the higher justice'?

230
00:23:14,504 --> 00:23:17,340
It's not miracles I need, but justice.

231
00:23:17,507 --> 00:23:20,260
So now you are
in a temper with your God?

232
00:23:20,343 --> 00:23:23,304
I am not rebelling against my God.

233
00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:26,307
I simply 'don't accept His world.

234
00:23:26,349 --> 00:23:28,392
How do you mean,
you don't accept the world

235
00:23:28,476 --> 00:23:30,436
What idiocy is this?

236
00:23:32,521 --> 00:23:34,481
Have you had anything to eat to-day?

237
00:23:40,362 --> 00:23:42,363
You need keeping up.

238
00:23:42,447 --> 00:23:45,324
I've got some sausage in my pocket.

239
00:23:45,366 --> 00:23:47,285
Only you won't eat sausage.

240
00:23:47,368 --> 00:23:48,411
Give me some.

241
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:54,458
You are going it! Why, it's a regular
mutiny, with barricades!

242
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:57,502
Well, my boy, we must make the most of it.
Come to my place.

243
00:23:58,253 --> 00:23:59,337
Shouldn't mind a drop of vodka myself.

244
00:23:59,379 --> 00:24:01,381
Vodka is going too far for you, I suppose.

245
00:24:01,423 --> 00:24:03,299
Give me some vodka too.

246
00:24:03,383 --> 00:24:06,385
You surprise me, brother!

247
00:24:08,262 --> 00:24:11,432
Alyosha, do you know where
we had better go?

248
00:24:11,473 --> 00:24:12,474
I don't care... where you like.

249
00:24:13,267 --> 00:24:15,519
Let's go to Grushenka, eh?
Will you come?

250
00:24:16,228 --> 00:24:17,229
Let's go to Grushenka.

251
00:24:17,312 --> 00:24:18,480
Let's go.

252
00:24:59,518 --> 00:25:07,483
Four years had passed since the merchant
Samsonov had brought the shy girl of eighteen.

253
00:25:08,276 --> 00:25:10,319
She was dreamy and sad.

254
00:25:10,361 --> 00:25:13,238
There were rumours that she had
been betrayed by someone,

255
00:25:13,322 --> 00:25:15,240
some sort of officer,

256
00:25:15,324 --> 00:25:20,412
and immediately afterwards
abandoned by him in poverty and disgrace.

257
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:43,266
Her name is Agrafena
Alexandrovna Svetlova.

258
00:25:43,349 --> 00:25:49,397
Though Grushenka's hold upon him was
so strong that he could not live without her,

259
00:25:49,438 --> 00:25:52,441
he did not settle
any considerable fortune on her.

260
00:25:53,234 --> 00:25:55,319
But he had presented her with a small sum,

261
00:25:55,402 --> 00:25:59,489
he helped her with his advice
to increase her capital.

262
00:26:00,282 --> 00:26:05,328
Needless to say, Grushenka had shown
marked abilities in that direction.

263
00:26:05,411 --> 00:26:09,457
For instance, that she had for some time
past, in partnership with old Karamazov,

264
00:26:10,249 --> 00:26:13,294
actually invested in the purchase
of bad debts for a trifle dirt cheap,

265
00:26:13,377 --> 00:26:17,297
and afterwards had made out
of them ten times their value.

266
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:22,344
So that many people began to say
that she was no better than a Jew.

267
00:26:32,478 --> 00:26:41,319
If you have to choose between the two, father
or son, you'd better choose the old man,

268
00:26:41,361 --> 00:26:44,447
if only you make sure the
old scoundrel will marry you

269
00:26:46,282 --> 00:26:49,285
and settle some fortune
on you beforehand.

270
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:52,496
But don't keep on with Mitya,
you'll get no good out of that.

271
00:27:03,381 --> 00:27:05,258
Who's there?

272
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,177
It's not he, it's nothing,
only other visitors.

273
00:27:09,303 --> 00:27:10,471
It's you, Rakitin?

274
00:27:11,222 --> 00:27:12,431
You quite frightened me.

275
00:27:14,391 --> 00:27:17,227
Whom have you brought?

276
00:27:22,482 --> 00:27:25,401
Haven't I managed to please you?

277
00:27:31,365 --> 00:27:33,367
Do send for candles!

278
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:35,452
Fenya, fetch him a candle.

279
00:27:36,245 --> 00:27:38,288
Well, you have chosen
a moment to bring him!

280
00:27:38,413 --> 00:27:40,290
I thought it was Mitya again.

281
00:27:40,457 --> 00:27:43,251
I am afraid
of your brother Mitya today, Alyosha.

282
00:27:43,293 --> 00:27:44,419
Why are you so afraid of Mitya today?

283
00:27:44,502 --> 00:27:47,213
I should have thought
you were not timid with him.

284
00:27:47,297 --> 00:27:51,425
I am expecting news, priceless news,
so I don't want Mitya at all.

285
00:27:53,385 --> 00:27:54,386
Fenya, did you look everywhere?

286
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,263
Perhaps he is hiding and spying.

287
00:27:56,347 --> 00:27:57,264
Are the shutters fastened?

288
00:27:57,347 --> 00:27:59,474
Everything's shut.

289
00:28:00,267 --> 00:28:01,435
I am dreadfully frightened myself.

290
00:28:03,436 --> 00:28:05,230
And why are you so dressed up?

291
00:28:05,271 --> 00:28:07,315
I tell you, I am expecting a message.

292
00:28:08,316 --> 00:28:12,319
Why do I have to talk to you
while such a visitor is standing here?

293
00:28:26,291 --> 00:28:30,419
Alyosha, my dear boy,
I gaze at you and can't believe my eyes.

294
00:28:32,463 --> 00:28:36,216
Though this is not the moment now,
I am awfully glad to see you.

295
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,344
How everything comes together today!

296
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:43,473
And why I am so glad to see you,
Alyosha, I couldn't say myself!

297
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:50,229
Come, don't you know why you're glad?

298
00:28:50,313 --> 00:28:52,398
You used to be always
pestering me to bring him.

299
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:53,441
You'd some object, I suppose.

300
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:57,236
I had a different object once,

301
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:01,365
but now that's over,
this is not the moment.

302
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:05,285
Why are you so depressed, Alyosha?

303
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:08,329
Are you afraid of me?

304
00:29:09,288 --> 00:29:12,333
Let me sit on your knee.

305
00:29:18,213 --> 00:29:21,383
I'll cheer you up, my pious boy.

306
00:29:21,508 --> 00:29:23,176
You won't be angry?

307
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,262
You've talked nonsense enough.

308
00:29:26,346 --> 00:29:28,181
You'd much better give us some champagne.

309
00:29:28,264 --> 00:29:29,307
You owe it me, you know you do!

310
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:33,185
Yes, I really do, I promised him
champagne, if he'd bring you?

311
00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:38,190
Fenya, Fenya,
bring us the bottle Mitya left!

312
00:29:38,357 --> 00:29:41,193
So be it, I'll drink with you.
I long for some dissipation.

313
00:29:41,234 --> 00:29:43,278
And what is this message,
may I ask, or is it a secret?

314
00:29:43,361 --> 00:29:47,198
It's not a secret, and you know it, too.

315
00:29:47,365 --> 00:29:51,327
My officer is coming, my officer is coming.

316
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:54,413
He is at Mokroe now.
He'll send a messenger from there.

317
00:29:55,247 --> 00:29:59,459
Mitya'll be up to something now - I say!

318
00:30:03,296 --> 00:30:04,297
Does he know?

319
00:30:04,381 --> 00:30:06,466
He know!
If he knew, there would be murder.

320
00:30:07,217 --> 00:30:09,302
Be quiet, Rakitin,
don't remind me of him.

321
00:30:09,344 --> 00:30:11,345
He has bruised my heart.

322
00:30:11,429 --> 00:30:13,472
I can think of Alyosha here.

323
00:30:14,223 --> 00:30:17,393
Alyosha, smile at me.

324
00:30:18,227 --> 00:30:22,356
Smile at my foolishness, at my pleasure.

325
00:30:28,403 --> 00:30:31,364
How kindly he looks at me!

326
00:30:31,405 --> 00:30:34,241
I've been thinking all this time
you were angry with me.

327
00:30:34,325 --> 00:30:38,412
Because of that young lady.
Katerina Ivanovna.

328
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:41,248
I was a cur, that's the truth.

329
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:43,458
But it's a good thing it happened so.

330
00:30:44,292 --> 00:30:46,336
It was a horrid thing,
but a good thing too.

331
00:30:46,419 --> 00:30:52,258
She screamed out
that I 'ought to be flogged.

332
00:30:52,341 --> 00:30:54,427
To win me over with her chocolate.

333
00:30:55,428 --> 00:30:58,263
No, it's a good thing
it did end like that.

334
00:30:58,472 --> 00:31:03,435
But I am still afraid of your being angry.

335
00:31:04,227 --> 00:31:07,188
She is really afraid
of a chicken like you.

336
00:31:07,272 --> 00:31:08,314
Because I love him.

337
00:31:08,356 --> 00:31:10,233
Do you believe I love you?

338
00:31:10,274 --> 00:31:11,442
Ah, you shameless woman!

339
00:31:12,235 --> 00:31:13,361
She is making you a declaration.

340
00:31:13,444 --> 00:31:15,237
Well, what of it, I love him!

341
00:31:15,321 --> 00:31:17,406
And what about your officer?
And the priceless message from Mokroe?

342
00:31:18,282 --> 00:31:20,242
That is quite different.

343
00:31:20,284 --> 00:31:22,202
That's a woman's way of looking at it!

344
00:31:22,286 --> 00:31:23,245
Don't you make me angry, Rakitin.

345
00:31:23,286 --> 00:31:25,163
I love Alyosha in a different way.

346
00:31:25,288 --> 00:31:26,373
Here's the champagne!

347
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:30,293
I had sly designs on you before.

348
00:31:30,335 --> 00:31:34,255
For I am a horrid, violent creature.

349
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:40,385
You're excited,
Agrafena Alexandrovna, and not yourself.

350
00:31:40,469 --> 00:31:43,347
When you've had a glass of champagne,
you'll be ready to dance.

351
00:31:46,308 --> 00:31:47,475
Alyosha, take a glass.

352
00:31:48,226 --> 00:31:50,395
What shall we drink to?

353
00:31:50,478 --> 00:31:52,188
The gates of paradise?

354
00:31:52,271 --> 00:31:54,232
What gates of paradise?

355
00:31:54,357 --> 00:31:56,317
No, I'd better not.

356
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,277
And you bragged!

357
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,195
Well, if so, I won't either.

358
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:03,323
He is rebelling
against his God and ready to eat sausage.

359
00:32:03,407 --> 00:32:05,283
How so?

360
00:32:05,325 --> 00:32:09,412
His elder died today,
Father Zossima, the saint.

361
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,252
So Father Zossima is dead?

362
00:32:18,504 --> 00:32:21,340
Good God, I did not know!

363
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:30,390
Goodness, what have I been doing,
sitting on his knee like this?

364
00:32:33,434 --> 00:32:37,313
Rakitin, don't taunt me
with having rebelled against God.

365
00:32:38,272 --> 00:32:41,316
I don't want to feel angry with you,
so you must be kinder, too.

366
00:32:42,234 --> 00:32:47,322
I've lost a treasure such as you have
never had, and you cannot judge me now.

367
00:32:48,323 --> 00:32:51,284
You had much better look at her.

368
00:32:53,453 --> 00:32:56,288
Do you see how she has pity on me?

369
00:32:58,207 --> 00:33:01,335
I came here to find a wicked
soul - I felt drawn to evil.

370
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:04,296
And I've found a loving heart.

371
00:33:06,214 --> 00:33:08,341
She had pity on me just now.

372
00:33:09,384 --> 00:33:12,303
Agrafena Alexandrovna,
I am speaking of you.

373
00:33:17,224 --> 00:33:19,310
You've raised my soul
from the depths.

374
00:33:19,393 --> 00:33:21,186
She has saved you, it seems.

375
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,397
And she meant to get you in her
clutches, do your realize that?

376
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,440
Stay, Rakitin.

377
00:33:26,441 --> 00:33:28,401
Hush, both of you.

378
00:33:28,443 --> 00:33:30,361
I'll tell you all about it.

379
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:35,199
Alyosha, your words make me ashamed.

380
00:33:35,283 --> 00:33:37,326
For I am bad and not good.

381
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:38,452
That's what I am.

382
00:33:39,245 --> 00:33:41,372
And you hush, Rakitin,
because you are telling lies.

383
00:33:43,248 --> 00:33:46,293
I had the low idea of trying
to get him in my clutches,

384
00:33:46,376 --> 00:33:48,295
but now you are lying,
now it's all different.

385
00:33:48,336 --> 00:33:50,380
And don't let me
hear anything more from you.

386
00:33:51,297 --> 00:33:54,258
They are both crazy.
I feel as though I were in a madhouse.

387
00:33:54,383 --> 00:33:56,218
They'll begin crying.

388
00:33:57,261 --> 00:34:02,266
Only let me tell you, Rakitin, though
I am bad, I did give away an onion.

389
00:34:02,349 --> 00:34:04,393
An onion?

390
00:34:08,271 --> 00:34:13,151
You see, Alyosha, I was boasting when
I told Rakitin I had given away an onion,

391
00:34:13,401 --> 00:34:16,237
but it's not to boast I tell you about it.

392
00:34:16,279 --> 00:34:19,365
Sit in that corner and be quiet,
as though you were my footman!

393
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:26,288
And now, Alyosha,
I'll tell you the whole truth.

394
00:34:27,164 --> 00:34:30,291
I used to hear from Matryona, my cook.

395
00:34:31,251 --> 00:34:33,419
Once upon a time
there was a peasant woman

396
00:34:33,461 --> 00:34:36,172
and a very wicked woman she was.

397
00:34:36,339 --> 00:34:42,302
And she died and did not
leave a single good deed behind.

398
00:34:43,178 --> 00:34:45,222
The devils caught her

399
00:34:45,305 --> 00:34:47,307
and plunged her into the lake of fire.

400
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,313
Sit!

401
00:34:58,234 --> 00:35:02,446
So her guardian angel
stood and wondered

402
00:35:04,448 --> 00:35:08,410
what good deed of hers he could
remember to tell to God.

403
00:35:08,493 --> 00:35:10,286
And she said,

404
00:35:10,328 --> 00:35:14,415
She once pulled up an onion in her
garden, and gave it to a beggar woman.

405
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:17,251
And God answered :

406
00:35:17,335 --> 00:35:20,421
'You take that onion then,
hold it out to her in the lake,

407
00:35:20,504 --> 00:35:22,339
and let her take hold and be pulled out.

408
00:35:22,423 --> 00:35:24,216
And if you can pull her out of the lake,

409
00:35:24,299 --> 00:35:26,218
let her come to Paradise,

410
00:35:26,301 --> 00:35:29,262
but if the onion breaks,
then the woman must stay where she is.'

411
00:35:29,471 --> 00:35:33,141
The angel ran to the woman
and held out the onion to her.

412
00:35:33,224 --> 00:35:35,184
When the other sinners in the lake,
began catching hold of her.

413
00:35:35,268 --> 00:35:36,310
And she began kicking them.

414
00:35:36,394 --> 00:35:39,188
'I'm to be pulled out, not you.
It's my onion, not yours.'

415
00:35:39,271 --> 00:35:42,274
As soon as she said that,
the woman fell into the lake.

416
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:47,154
So the angel wept and went away.

417
00:35:47,237 --> 00:35:49,197
The onion broke.

418
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:53,326
So that's the story,
Alyosha ; I know it by heart.

419
00:35:53,368 --> 00:35:56,329
For I am that wicked woman myself.

420
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:59,331
I boasted to Rakitin
that I had given away an onion,

421
00:35:59,373 --> 00:36:01,333
but to you I'll say:

422
00:36:02,251 --> 00:36:05,170
'I've done nothing but give away
one onion all my life,

423
00:36:05,379 --> 00:36:08,298
that's the only good deed I've done.

424
00:36:08,381 --> 00:36:10,216
Don't praise me.

425
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,261
I promised Rakitin twenty-five
roubles if he would bring you to me.

426
00:36:13,344 --> 00:36:16,347
I wanted to get you in my clutches.

427
00:36:22,436 --> 00:36:24,188
Take it, Rakitin.

428
00:36:24,229 --> 00:36:27,399
I owe it you,
there's no fear of your refusing it.

429
00:36:27,482 --> 00:36:29,317
Likely I should refuse it.

430
00:36:29,401 --> 00:36:32,237
Fools are made for wise men's profit.

431
00:36:32,278 --> 00:36:33,363
And now hold your tongue.

432
00:36:33,446 --> 00:36:35,198
You don't like us, so hold your tongue.

433
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:37,325
One loves people for some reason,
but what have either of you done for me?

434
00:36:38,367 --> 00:36:40,327
You cannot understand that. He can.

435
00:36:40,411 --> 00:36:44,248
Alyosha, tell me what to do.

436
00:36:44,331 --> 00:36:49,211
Am I to forgive the officer or not?

437
00:36:49,461 --> 00:36:51,463
But you have forgiven him already.

438
00:36:53,256 --> 00:36:55,216
Yes, I really have forgiven him.

439
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:02,348
What an abject heart!

440
00:37:09,437 --> 00:37:12,273
To my abject heart!

441
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:26,245
Why are you dressed up like that?

442
00:37:28,372 --> 00:37:31,124
Perhaps I didn't forget him.

443
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,418
You don't know all that is in my heart!

444
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,379
I'll sit by him, fascinate him.

445
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,297
'Do you see what I am like now?'
I'll say to him.

446
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:41,383
'Well, and that's enough
for you, my dear sir.'

447
00:37:42,384 --> 00:37:44,428
Or I'll take a knife with me.

448
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:47,306
I haven't decided it yet.

449
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:51,393
Oh, you started crying!

450
00:37:52,352 --> 00:37:54,229
Misha, be merciful.

451
00:37:54,312 --> 00:37:55,355
She's found someone to plead her cause!

452
00:37:55,438 --> 00:37:57,273
Why, are you in love with her?

453
00:37:57,315 --> 00:38:02,111
Agrafena Alexandrovna, he's really
in love with you, you've made a conquest!

454
00:38:02,194 --> 00:38:04,196
Hush, evil tongue!

455
00:38:04,279 --> 00:38:06,323
Mistress darling,
a carriage from Mokroe for you.

456
00:38:06,365 --> 00:38:08,241
And a letter, here's the letter.

457
00:38:19,168 --> 00:38:21,295
He has sent for me.

458
00:38:22,463 --> 00:38:25,174
He whistles!

459
00:38:25,257 --> 00:38:28,260
Crawl back, little dog!

460
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,348
I will go.

461
00:38:33,431 --> 00:38:35,266
Good-bye!

462
00:38:35,308 --> 00:38:38,352
Good-bye, Alyosha, my fate is sealed.

463
00:38:38,436 --> 00:38:41,355
Grushenka is flying to a new life.

464
00:38:43,357 --> 00:38:45,401
I feel as though I were drunk!

465
00:38:50,405 --> 00:38:53,158
Mistress darling!

466
00:38:57,203 --> 00:38:58,329
Go!

467
00:39:00,373 --> 00:39:02,374
Alyosha, give my greetings
to your brother Mitya,

468
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:04,335
And tell him that Grushenka
loved him only one hour,

469
00:39:04,376 --> 00:39:06,336
only one short hour she loved him.

470
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:09,381
So let him remember
that hour all his life.

471
00:39:13,301 --> 00:39:15,428
Go!

472
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:25,187
She murders your brother Mitya.

473
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:27,397
And then tells him
to remember it all his life!

474
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:30,317
What ferocity!

475
00:39:36,197 --> 00:39:38,241
Well?

476
00:39:40,243 --> 00:39:42,203
So you've saved the sinner?

477
00:39:42,286 --> 00:39:43,287
Driven out the seven devils?

478
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:44,330
Hush!

479
00:39:44,413 --> 00:39:47,166
So you despise me now
for those twenty-five roubles?

480
00:39:47,249 --> 00:39:49,167
I've sold my friend, you think.

481
00:39:49,251 --> 00:39:51,378
But you are not Christ,
you know, and I am not Judas.

482
00:39:51,419 --> 00:39:54,214
I'd forgotten about it,
you remind me of it yourself.

483
00:39:54,255 --> 00:39:56,341
Damnation take you all and each of you.

484
00:39:56,424 --> 00:39:59,177
Why the devil did I take you up?
I don't want to know you.

485
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,386
Go alone, there's your road!

486
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:27,997
THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV

487
00:43:19,926 --> 00:43:22,256
End of Part Five
