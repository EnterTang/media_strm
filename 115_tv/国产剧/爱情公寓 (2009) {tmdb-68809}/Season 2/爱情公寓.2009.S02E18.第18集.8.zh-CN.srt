1
00:00:01,472 --> 00:00:03,797
每段关系都都有种模式
Every relationship has its own dynamic.

2
00:00:03,809 --> 00:00:05,980
比如说 我和我妈每晚睡前
For example, my mom and I still like to talk

3
00:00:06,057 --> 00:00:07,044
都会说个不停
every night before bed.

4
00:00:07,085 --> 00:00:10,667
然后小狗找到了我的另一只园丁鞋
And then the dog found my other gardening clog.

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,670
我今天的新鲜事就这些了
And that's everything that happened to me today.

6
00:00:12,688 --> 00:00:14,007
一天还没结束呢
And the day's not over yet.

7
00:00:14,053 --> 00:00:16,766
我们来放点莱伊・洛维特的歌然后滚个床单吧
Let's put on some Lyle Lovett and get horizontal.

8
00:00:16,768 --> 00:00:17,918
嗯
Mmm.

9
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:19,285
好 再见
Okay, Bye.

10
00:00:19,499 --> 00:00:20,852
好恶
Ew.

11
00:00:22,428 --> 00:00:24,205
但是我觉得我永远搞不懂
But I don't think I will ever understand

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,512
克洛伊和詹姆斯的奇怪关系
Chloe and James' dynamic.

13
00:00:25,512 --> 00:00:26,909
你今晚油光满面真是太好了
Good thing your face was so oily tonight.

14
00:00:26,917 --> 00:00:28,517
我都能照着你额头补妆
I could check my makeup in your forehead.

15
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:29,818
你最好补补妆 你看起来像俄亥俄州的
I wish you had. You look like a runner-up

16
00:00:29,819 --> 00:00:31,553
儿童选美大赛亚军
at a child's beauty pageant in ohio.

17
00:00:31,554 --> 00:00:33,389
你看着像刚从傻蛋颁奖仪式上回来
You look like you just got back from the douchie awards

18
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,890
赢了五座傻蛋奖杯
and you won five douchies.

19
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:37,026
而你只有让说唱歌手摸你才能拿到奖项
Only award You could ever win is for letting rappers touch you.

20
00:00:37,027 --> 00:00:38,696
我不知道你们怎么会这样说话
I don't get how you guys talk to each other like that.

21
00:00:38,697 --> 00:00:41,598
太损了 尤其是在睡前
It's so mean, especially before bedtime.

22
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:43,098
不损啊 这就是我们
It's not mean. It's just us.

23
00:00:43,099 --> 00:00:46,001
我不知道你穿的是什么鬼东西
And what I don't get is what the hell you're wearing.

24
00:00:46,002 --> 00:00:48,103
噢 是我的中西部早餐睡衣
Oh. They're my midwest breakfast pajamas.

25
00:00:48,104 --> 00:00:49,638
我高中时就有了
I've had them since high school.

26
00:00:50,148 --> 00:00:51,140
我上高中时
When I was in high school,

27
00:00:51,141 --> 00:00:54,376
你已经是个成人 在电视上装嫩装成高中生
you were a grown man pretending to be in high school on tv.

28
00:00:54,377 --> 00:00:55,878
看我在电视里扮演高中生
Watching me pretend to be in high school on TV

29
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:58,214
是你最像高中生的的时候
was as close to high school as you ever got.

30
00:00:58,219 --> 00:00:59,715
你们让我很不舒服
You are agitating me.

31
00:00:59,716 --> 00:01:01,953
我得再喝一杯甘菊茶才能睡着
I'm gonna need a second cup of chamomile to go to sleep.

32
00:01:01,954 --> 00:01:04,006
喔 放点这个进去
Ooh. Put some of these in there.

33
00:01:04,045 --> 00:01:05,623
保证睡得像死猪一样
You'll sleep like you're dead.


16
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:10,004
# 我不完美 我也不打小报告 #
I'm not perfect, I'm no snitch

17
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,573
# 但是我可以告诉你 #
but I can tell you 

18
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,308
# 她是一个... #
She's a...

19
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:17,010
# 吧哒哒哒哒吧 吧哒吧 #
Ba-Da-Da-Da-Da-Ba, ba-Da-Ba

20
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,812
23号公寓第二季第十八集 七年损友

34
00:01:20,137 --> 00:01:21,805
阿朱 看看我在地铁上找到的背包
June, Look at this backpack I found on the subway.

35
00:01:21,805 --> 00:01:23,107
我觉得应该是一个小孩的
I think it belongs to a little kid,

36
00:01:23,108 --> 00:01:26,142
但是也有不少好东西
but it's still got good stuff in it.

37
00:01:27,107 --> 00:01:29,717
不好意思 只是在为我的艺术展自拍
Sorry. Just taking a self-Portrait for my art show.

38
00:01:29,717 --> 00:01:30,748
怎么样?
What do you think?

39
00:01:30,749 --> 00:01:32,449
这边
This side,

40
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:33,450
这边
this side,

41
00:01:33,451 --> 00:01:36,453
还是果照?
or naked?

42
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:37,951
艺术展么?
Art show?

43
00:01:37,955 --> 00:01:40,522
是的 叫做"糟蹋黄油百种法"
Yep. It's called "Different butter VIOLATIONS."

44
00:01:40,523 --> 00:01:42,358
噢 你想怎么糟蹋黄油呢?
Ooh. How are you gonna violate butter?

45
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:45,227
希望你摔打人造奶油 我最讨厌人造奶油
I hope you smack around some margarine. I hate margarine.

46
00:01:45,228 --> 00:01:47,396
其实 我在重现一些人糟蹋黄油的情形
Actually, I'm recreating some butter violations

47
00:01:47,397 --> 00:01:50,065
我这些年来做卫生督查时看到过很多
that I've encountered over the years as a health inspector.

48
00:01:50,204 --> 00:01:51,500
你们都会去的吧 是不?
You guys'll be there, right?

49
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:53,002
当然了 伊莱 我们不会错过...
Of course, Eli. We wouldn't miss...

50
00:01:53,003 --> 00:01:54,470
会有红酒吗?  高档的红酒?
is there gonna be wine? Like, good wine?

51
00:01:54,471 --> 00:01:55,673
要能喝得这么快的红酒?
Like, wine I could drink this fast?

52
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:01,801
你好 是詹姆斯吗?
Hello. Is James there?

53
00:02:02,952 --> 00:02:03,846
呃... 嗨
Uh... hey.

54
00:02:03,847 --> 00:02:06,083
好消息 明天与艾米丽的早午餐照旧继续
Uh, good news. Brunch with Emily tomorrow is still on.

55
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,784
你确定么?
Are you sure?

56
00:02:07,893 --> 00:02:09,267
我们今早讨论过之后 你还没有丧失兴趣吗?
You haven't lost interest since we talked this morning?

57
00:02:09,386 --> 00:02:11,553
没有 这不是很好嘛 我等不及让你见她了
No. Isn't that great? I can't wait for you to meet her.

58
00:02:11,554 --> 00:02:13,778
她很聪明 乐观积极
She's really smart, positive attitude,

59
00:02:13,814 --> 00:02:15,234
有漂亮的大胸
great breasts.

60
00:02:15,359 --> 00:02:16,128
你知道不?
You know what?

61
00:02:16,194 --> 00:02:17,726
其实应该把"漂亮大胸"放"乐观积极"之前
Actually, "Great breasts" Before "Positive attitude."

62
00:02:17,727 --> 00:02:19,595
你... 你可以脑海里出现那样的画面
You... You should flip those in your mind.

63
00:02:19,596 --> 00:02:20,929
我头发打薄得怎样了?
How's my fade coming?

64
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,598
你的发型不叫打薄
That's not what your haircut's called.

65
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:25,106
要去见艾米丽 我很兴奋
Well, I'm excited to meet Emily.

66
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,520
我不会穿的过于火辣
I won't rock anything too slutty

67
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,669
因为我不想对她造成威胁
'Cause I don't want to intimidate her.

68
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,032
但是我的确想穿新买的上托胸罩
But I do wanna Wear my new push-up bra,

69
00:02:29,118 --> 00:02:31,208
所以我得考虑一下
so I'm gonna have to figure this out.

70
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:32,665
我真不相信
I can't believe

71
00:02:32,665 --> 00:02:35,044
詹姆斯一整个月都约同一个女孩出去
James has been seeing the same girl for a month.

72
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:36,849
他这么喜欢这姑娘 真好呀
It's so sweet that he likes her enough

73
00:02:36,858 --> 00:02:38,609
喜欢到想介绍给我们认识
that he wants to introduce her to us.

74
00:02:38,773 --> 00:02:40,180
我们就像他的父母一样
It's like we're his parents.

75
00:02:40,255 --> 00:02:41,885
或者朋友 阿朱
Or his friends, June.

76
00:02:41,886 --> 00:02:43,620
或只是他的朋友
Or just his friends.

77
00:02:47,691 --> 00:02:49,892
噢 我来过这里 有一次我付钱时支票不够用
Oh, I know this place. I ran out on a check here once.

78
00:02:49,893 --> 00:02:51,495
但没事 那时我带着假发
But it's okay. I was wearing a wig.

79
00:02:53,497 --> 00:02:55,365
{\an8}别招待她

80
00:02:53,497 --> 00:02:55,365
你们好 欢迎前来
Hey. Thank you for coming.

81
00:02:55,366 --> 00:02:57,833
这就是可爱的艾米丽
This is the lovely Emily.

82
00:02:57,834 --> 00:02:59,570
你一定是克洛伊吧 很高兴认...
You must be Chloe. It's such a pleasure to...

83
00:02:59,571 --> 00:03:01,004
反对
Veto.

84
00:03:01,005 --> 00:03:02,973
噢 很抱歉 我们必须分手
Ohh. I'm sorry. We have to break up.

85
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:05,708
虽然我们相处得很愉快
This was fun, though.

86
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:07,409
我... 我不明白 我...
W... I don't... I don't understand. I...

87
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,248
詹姆斯和我有权力反对对方的约会对象
James and I have veto power over whoever the other one dates.

88
00:03:10,297 --> 00:03:12,400
是的 有一人"反对" 另一个人必须遵守
Yeah, if one of us yells "Veto," the other one has to honor it

89
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,916
然后立即结束这段关系
and end the relationship immediately.

90
00:03:13,917 --> 00:03:16,051
你说得真像回事 其实不然
You're saying that like it's a thing, and it is not.

91
00:03:16,052 --> 00:03:17,874
这是一回事 是我们的事 我们一直这样
It is a thing. It's our thing. We've been doing it forever.

92
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:20,578
克洛伊想要与全国汽车赛冠军杰夫・戈登约会
Ever since Chloe wanted to date nascar champion Jeff Gordon.

93
00:03:21,012 --> 00:03:21,956
反对
Veto.

94
00:03:22,127 --> 00:03:24,060
- 什么?! - 反对!
- What?! - veto!

95
00:03:24,183 --> 00:03:26,115
- 什么?! - 反...
- What?! - ve...

96
00:03:27,529 --> 00:03:29,511
反对!
veto!

97
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:32,970
但是杰夫・戈登是名人 所以你也不算丢份
But Jeff Gordon is a celebrity, so you're in good company.

98
00:03:32,971 --> 00:03:34,604
永别了
Bye forever.

99
00:03:34,605 --> 00:03:35,672
呃...
Uh...

100
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,039
提醒一句哦
do yourself a favor, though.

101
00:03:37,297 --> 00:03:38,909
一定要再来尝尝这儿的肉桂面包
Come back here sometime and try the cinnamon buns.

102
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:41,188
非常美味
They're amazing.

103
00:03:46,003 --> 00:03:48,033
你怎么那么快就反对艾米丽
How could you vet Emily so quickly?

104
00:03:48,034 --> 00:03:49,268
你又不了解她
You didn't even know her.

105
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:51,444
我不需要 这就像超能力一样
I didn't need to. It's like a special power.

106
00:03:51,605 --> 00:03:54,100
有些人有看不见的超能力
Some people have special powers Where they can't see,

107
00:03:54,107 --> 00:03:56,392
有些人有听不到的超能力
and some people have special powers Where they can't hear.

108
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,943
他们是盲人和聋子
Those are blind and deaf people.

109
00:03:57,944 --> 00:03:59,279
他们其实是缺少能力
They're actually lacking powers.

110
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,298
我的能力就是
My special power is,

111
00:04:00,298 --> 00:04:03,181
知道何时詹姆斯的恋情会不了了之
I know when James' relationships are going to end badly.

112
00:04:03,182 --> 00:04:05,751
我不清楚怎么做到的 但是我只要看一眼
I don't know how I do it, but I take one look at the girl

113
00:04:05,752 --> 00:04:07,652
就像"美丽心灵"电影里一样
and it's like I "Beautiful mind" it.

114
00:04:07,653 --> 00:04:09,221
相信我 如果他继续和她约会
And trust me, if he kept going out with her,

115
00:04:09,222 --> 00:04:11,223
他会变得软弱又自满
he'd become soft and complacent.

116
00:04:11,443 --> 00:04:14,523
可怜的女孩啊 你当着她的面就否决了他
That poor girl. You vetoed her right to her face.

117
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,636
她连面包都没吃到
She didn't even get any bread.

118
00:04:15,695 --> 00:04:16,568
阿朱 如果你不对你的朋友
June, if you're not

119
00:04:16,596 --> 00:04:18,131
完全诚实的话
being completely honest with your friends,

120
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:19,297
那么你就不是在帮忙
then you're not helping them

121
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:21,535
让他们变得更好
be the best that they can possibly be.

122
00:04:21,536 --> 00:04:22,101
顺便一说
By the way,

123
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:24,034
你这肤色用错了粉底液
you're using the wrong foundation for your skin tone,

124
00:04:24,091 --> 00:04:25,632
和你的肤色太违和
it actually clashes with your skin tone.

125
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:28,544
就像你的脸是一个人 脖子是另一个
It's like your face is one girl, and your neck is another.

126
00:04:30,344 --> 00:04:32,746
我刚买了整整一管这东西!
I just bought a whole tub of this stuff!

127
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:37,549
我不知道 我差点觉得太大比太小更难看
I don't know. I almost think too big is worse than too small.

128
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,267
我明白 这是因为你是男人
I know. That's because you a guy.

129
00:04:39,324 --> 00:04:40,719
相信我 如果你是女人
But trust me, if you're a woman,

130
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,503
太小会让你的鼻子看起来巨大
small just makes your nose look giant.

131
00:04:42,506 --> 00:04:44,003
你们俩还在讨论下半身么?
Are you guys still talking about penises?

132
00:04:44,004 --> 00:04:45,726
不是 我们已经说到墨镜了
No, we've moved on to sunglasses.

133
00:04:45,727 --> 00:04:47,326
是吗?
Did we?

134
00:04:47,577 --> 00:04:48,693
噢 老K来电
Oh. Special k is calling.

135
00:04:48,694 --> 00:04:50,264
她刚才泰国回来 我挂了
She just got back from thailand. I gotta go.

136
00:04:50,265 --> 00:04:51,197
噢 老...
Ooh, spec...

137
00:04:51,932 --> 00:04:53,366
什么事 贱人?
What up, bitch?

138
00:04:54,172 --> 00:04:56,163
不会吧 贱人
Shut up, bitch.

139
00:04:56,203 --> 00:04:57,403
带我一个 贱人
I am in, bitch.

140
00:04:57,404 --> 00:04:58,771
噢!
Ooh!

141
00:04:58,772 --> 00:05:00,442
老K刚刚告诉我有个聚会
Special K just told me about a party

142
00:05:00,464 --> 00:05:02,705
斯派克・李在那大发雷霆
that's happening right now where spike Lee is angry.

143
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,044
詹姆斯一直渴望与他共事
James has been dying to work with him.

144
00:05:04,045 --> 00:05:05,206
我们得赶紧过去
We've gotta go.

145
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:08,744
噢 天啊! 我爱死他了! 这一定很有趣!
Oh, my god! I love him! This is gonna be so much fun!

146
00:05:08,748 --> 00:05:11,016
我记得"为所应为"里的每一个字
I memorized every word of "do the right thing."

147
00:05:11,017 --> 00:05:13,018
我弄着头发 你给我复述一下
Please recite it to me while I do my hair.

148
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:15,220
"我给你讲一个左右手的故事"
"Let me tell you a story about the right hand, left hand."

149
00:05:15,221 --> 00:05:17,391
"是关于正义与邪恶的故事
"It is a tale of Good and evil.

150
00:05:17,392 --> 00:05:20,827
仇恨...是凯恩用这只手冰冻了他的兄弟"
Hate--It is with this hand that Cane iced his brother."

151
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,164
带上你那顶软呢帽 詹姆斯!
Grab your least annoying fedora, James!

152
00:05:24,165 --> 00:05:26,129
我们...要见斯派克
We're... going to see spike.

153
00:05:26,397 --> 00:05:28,538
克洛伊 我可以解释的
Chloe. I can explain.

154
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:30,804
她来这儿干嘛? 我否决了她
What is she doing here? I vetoed her.

155
00:05:30,805 --> 00:05:32,205
是 我...
Yeah, I, uh...

156
00:05:33,173 --> 00:05:34,808
我们还在交往
I didn't end up doing that.

157
00:05:36,276 --> 00:05:39,312
嗨 艾米丽 我是阿朱 我们吃饭的时候见过
Hi, Emily. I'm June. We met at brunch.

158
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:43,122
"诺比特!"
"Norbit"!

159
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,217
我讨厌这部电影直到我意识到
I hated this movie until I realized

160
00:05:45,218 --> 00:05:47,187
是艾迪・墨菲 这是艾迪・墨菲...
that's Eddie Murphy, that is Eddie Murphy...

161
00:05:47,188 --> 00:05:50,089
你猜怎么着? 是艾迪・墨菲
and guess what? That is Eddie Murphy.

162
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,654
噢 天啊 你们下面还穿着衣服
Oh, my God. You're clothed under there.

163
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,792
给点你们慢慢聊如何?
Why don't I give you guys time to talk?

164
00:06:01,893 --> 00:06:04,514
我去... 餐厅
I'll go stand in the... dining room.

165
00:06:04,861 --> 00:06:06,028
我能看见你们 你们也能看见我
won't be awkward

166
00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:07,891
也不会觉得奇怪
that I can see you, and you can see me.

167
00:06:08,115 --> 00:06:08,984
说吧
Talk.

168
00:06:09,017 --> 00:06:10,386
我...
I...

169
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:13,458
我...我..我不知道说什么
I-I-I don't know what to say.

170
00:06:13,537 --> 00:06:16,011
她喜欢我本人 而不是电视上的形象吧?
She likes me for me, not the guy on tv. Right, em?

171
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:18,082
噢 是的 我根本就不知道他上过电视
Oh, it's True. I didn't even know he was on a show.

172
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,652
反对! 我反对你的长相
Ugh, veto! I veto your face.

173
00:06:21,024 --> 00:06:22,708
克洛伊 够了
Chloe, it's done.

174
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,550
你不能只是无视否决权
You can't just override the veto.

175
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,645
或者他可以呢?
Or can he?

176
00:06:26,985 --> 00:06:29,816
詹姆斯又不是第一次无视否决权
This isn't the first time James hasn't honored the veto.

177
00:06:30,153 --> 00:06:31,134
呃!
Ugh!

178
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:33,572
- 卢瑟! - 抱歉詹姆斯 我忍不住
- Luther! - Sorry, James. I couldn't resist.

179
00:06:33,592 --> 00:06:36,393
克洛伊已经这么对我很多次了
Chloe's shock-Snapped me so many times.

180
00:06:36,394 --> 00:06:37,760
你的松弛机要停产了
Your relaxer got discontinued.

181
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:41,328
火岛爆炸了
Fire island exploded.

182
00:06:43,354 --> 00:06:45,064
帕蒂・拉贝尔死了
Patti Labelle died.

183
00:06:47,118 --> 00:06:48,120
好了 克洛伊 听我说
All right, Chloe, listen to me.

184
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,867
有时候我的确无视否决权
It's True I haven't always honored the veto,

185
00:06:49,932 --> 00:06:52,588
只是那时我非常非常喜欢那姑娘
but only times when I really, really liked the girl.

186
00:06:52,754 --> 00:06:54,410
或者只是想跟她睡
Or wanted to keep sleeping with her.

187
00:06:54,411 --> 00:06:56,045
这也不行
That doesn't make it okay.

188
00:06:56,046 --> 00:06:57,725
不管怎么说你和那些女孩分手
And you broke up with Those girls anyway,

189
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,284
这说明我否决她们是对的
which means I was right to veto them.

190
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:01,802
是 最后那些关系都结束了
Yeah. Eventually, those relationships ended,

191
00:07:01,869 --> 00:07:03,449
但是我决定什么时候结束 不是你
but I decided when, not you.

192
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,488
我意思是 你可能有点...
I mean, you can be a little...

193
00:07:05,624 --> 00:07:07,391
嗯 难搞
Mm, difficult.

194
00:07:07,392 --> 00:07:09,292
有时候对你说一套做一套
sometimes it's easier just to tell you one thing

195
00:07:09,293 --> 00:07:10,726
更容易点
and then do something else.

196
00:07:10,727 --> 00:07:12,497
所以你一直都在耍我?
So you've just been humoring me?

197
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:14,464
不是! 不是
No! No.

198
00:07:14,613 --> 00:07:15,959
好吧...
Well...

199
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:17,366
我意思是... 是 技术层面上来说
I mean... Yeah, technically.

200
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:20,002
好 你知道吗? 这段关系完了
Okay, you know what? This isn't gonna work.

201
00:07:20,003 --> 00:07:21,537
克洛伊 听着 我告诉过你
Chloe, listen. I told you.

202
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:22,705
我是不会和艾米丽分手的
I'm not gonna break up with Emily.

203
00:07:22,706 --> 00:07:25,343
不 我是说你和我 我们结束了
No, I meant you and me. This isn't gonna work.

204
00:07:26,477 --> 00:07:28,513
我想我们该冷静一段时间
I think we should take a break.

205
00:07:30,548 --> 00:07:32,316
也许是的
Maybe we should.

206
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,278
好
Fine.

207
00:07:34,752 --> 00:07:37,086
别等你的事业有难时跑回来找我
But don't come running to me when your career suffers

208
00:07:37,087 --> 00:07:38,254
因为你和她的关系
because your relationship with her

209
00:07:38,255 --> 00:07:39,722
让你变得软弱自满
makes you soft and complacent.

210
00:07:39,723 --> 00:07:41,257
行 你也别等到缺了我不行时
Well, don't you come running back to me when you realize

211
00:07:41,258 --> 00:07:43,392
跑回来找我
how difficult it is to live in a beek-Less world.

212
00:07:43,393 --> 00:07:46,264
变得严重了 我们该怎么办 他们正在分手!
This is serious. We should do something. They're breaking up!

213
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:48,498
别担心 我来解决
Don't worry. I've got this.

214
00:07:49,634 --> 00:07:50,968
嗨!
Hey!

215
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:52,136
不!
No!

216
00:07:52,137 --> 00:07:53,737
太慢了 噢
Too slow, ho.

217
00:08:00,011 --> 00:08:03,179
我偷了斯派克・李的棒球帽
I stole spike Lee's baseball hat.

218
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,414
我没有戴 我也不会戴的 但是拿着它很好玩
I'm not wearing it. I won't wear it. But it's fun to hold.

219
00:08:05,415 --> 00:08:07,083
把你的钥匙给我 我把他们放帽子里
Give me your keys. I'll put 'em in there.

220
00:08:07,084 --> 00:08:08,250
我不敢相信你和詹姆斯分手后
I can't believe you went to that party

221
00:08:08,251 --> 00:08:09,485
又去了那个聚会
after you and James broke up.

222
00:08:09,486 --> 00:08:11,255
你们做朋友七年了
You guys have been friends for seven years.

223
00:08:11,256 --> 00:08:12,422
这不是小事
It is a big deal.

224
00:08:12,423 --> 00:08:14,524
这是事实 友谊结束了
It happens. Friendships die.

225
00:08:14,525 --> 00:08:17,361
帽子被偷了 钥匙在里面
Hats get stolen. Keys go in them.

226
00:08:17,362 --> 00:08:19,516
好吧 你可以假装不在乎 但我不能
Well, you can pretend you don't care, but I can't.

227
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,013
你们俩对我来说都很重要
You both mean a lot to me,

228
00:08:21,024 --> 00:08:23,179
我不会选择任何一方的
and I am not going to choose sides.

229
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,368
我父母离婚时我犹豫了一星期
I did that one weekend when my parents split up.

230
00:08:25,369 --> 00:08:26,335
我选了我爸爸...
I chose my dad--

231
00:08:26,336 --> 00:08:27,603
阿朱 就不能乘你和詹姆斯出去的时候
June, can you save this awesome story

232
00:08:27,604 --> 00:08:30,208
再讲这精彩故事么? 谢谢
for when you're hanging out with James? Thanks.

233
00:08:32,377 --> 00:08:33,543
女士们好
Hello, ladies.

234
00:08:33,544 --> 00:08:35,311
不要听到"那个男的"
Not to sound like "That guy,"

235
00:08:35,312 --> 00:08:37,480
不过我的艺术展的传单做好啦
but my art show Flyers are ready.

236
00:08:37,481 --> 00:08:39,382
太好了! 我好激动 我爱黄油
Cool! I'm excited. I love butter.

237
00:08:39,383 --> 00:08:40,518
为什么? 因为你从那些成立胆固醇食品组
Why? Because you're from one of those states

238
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:43,987
的那些州来吗?
where Cholesterol's a food group?

239
00:08:43,988 --> 00:08:45,621
你在说什么啊?
What are you talking about?

240
00:08:45,622 --> 00:08:47,392
你们那儿的人是直接从搅拌机里吃
Do your people eat straight from the churn

241
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:49,693
还是用盘子吃东西?
or do they use plates?

242
00:08:49,694 --> 00:08:52,363
克洛伊 我不和你互相损
Chloe, I'm not doing this mean thing with you.

243
00:08:52,364 --> 00:08:56,366
你家人的膝盖是原装的?
Does anyone in your family have their original knees?

244
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:58,401
噢 天啊 我不知道是过敏还是什么
Oh, god, I don't know if it's allergies or what,

245
00:08:58,402 --> 00:09:00,503
眼睛里进了东西
but there's something in there.

246
00:09:00,504 --> 00:09:02,473
噢 算了吧! 你在这方面很不擅长!
Oh, forget it! You're terrible at this!

247
00:09:06,411 --> 00:09:09,112
你好 詹姆斯的前任朋友
Hello, former friend of James.

248
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:11,347
我把你留在他那儿的所有东西
I have taken the liberty of returning all the possessions

249
00:09:11,348 --> 00:09:12,483
都送来了
you left at his place.

250
00:09:12,484 --> 00:09:15,485
你的手铐 咕咕娃音碟...
Your handcuffs, a goo goo dolls cd...

251
00:09:15,486 --> 00:09:17,487
另一个咕咕娃音碟
another Goo Goo dolls cd,

252
00:09:17,488 --> 00:09:20,323
还有一张去特德・丹森家的地图
and a map to Ted Danson's house.

253
00:09:20,324 --> 00:09:22,360
好极了 因为我也把他留在这儿的
Great, because I also put together

254
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:25,295
东西装了起来
a box of things that James left here.

255
00:09:25,296 --> 00:09:27,730
奇怪 我有和那一样的抓痒器
That is weird. I have that same back scratcher.

256
00:09:27,731 --> 00:09:29,698
这是我的小狗梅齐的照片!
And that is a photo of my dog Maisie!

257
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:32,268
- 这是我的东西! - 被你发现了 嗯?
- This is my stuff! - Oh, you caught that, huh?

258
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:35,339
我本来要说 詹姆斯已经有两个抓痒器了
I was gonna say, James already has two back scratchers.

259
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,474
你们正看着呢
You're looking at 'em.

260
00:09:39,243 --> 00:09:40,243
嗯!
Mmm!

261
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:43,679
真是太好了 还没有人在这个厨房做过饭
It's amazing. Nobody has ever cooked in this kitchen before.

262
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,414
他一直把钱放在烤箱里
He was keeping money in the oven.

263
00:09:45,415 --> 00:09:47,083
哈! 我只是觉得
Ha! I just think it's great

264
00:09:47,084 --> 00:09:48,551
我能和你还有克洛伊做朋友真是太好了
that I can be friends with both you and Chloe.

265
00:09:48,552 --> 00:09:50,386
我会完全保持中立的 知道吗?
I'm gonna be totally neutral, you know?

266
00:09:50,387 --> 00:09:51,720
我不会再选爸爸了
I'm not picking my dad again.

267
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:53,458
嗯 你好像有话要说 阿朱
Well, sounds like there's a story here, June.

268
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,325
还是别说了
Let's blow past it.

269
00:09:55,326 --> 00:09:56,626
哦
Oh.

270
00:09:56,627 --> 00:09:59,395
我不会选任何一方 但我觉得你和克洛伊...
I'm not picking sides, but I do think that you and Chloe shou--

271
00:09:59,396 --> 00:10:00,663
我... 我希望你别说了
I'm--I'm gonna stop you right there.

272
00:10:00,664 --> 00:10:02,264
我一点都不想听到克洛伊的事
I don't need to hear anything about Chloe.

273
00:10:02,265 --> 00:10:03,532
我很清楚接下来会怎样
I know exactly what's gonna happen.

274
00:10:03,533 --> 00:10:04,700
下次她在满是青年人的俱乐部里
The next time she projectile vomits

275
00:10:04,701 --> 00:10:06,402
乱扔东西随处呕吐时
in a club full of 20-Somethings,

276
00:10:06,403 --> 00:10:08,504
不会再来让我付清洁费啦
she's not gonna have me to pay the dry cleaning bill.

277
00:10:08,505 --> 00:10:11,173
好吧 她是不会真的到处扔东西呕吐的...
Okay, she didn't really projectile Vomit all over--

278
00:10:11,174 --> 00:10:12,977
- 上周三 - 上个月两次了
- last wednesday. - Twice last month.

279
00:10:19,317 --> 00:10:20,583
- 看见你分享的昨晚和詹姆斯
- Saw the pictures of your dinner with James

280
00:10:20,584 --> 00:10:22,691
吃饭时的照片了 - 很愉快呢
on Instagram last night. - Oh, yeah, it was fun.

281
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,035
是 看起来不错
Yeah, it looked like it.

282
00:10:24,108 --> 00:10:25,321
你看到我传的照片了吗?
Uh, did you see the pictures I posted?

283
00:10:25,322 --> 00:10:28,011
- 不 没看到 - 哦对了! 我没传照片
- No, I didn't. - Oh, right! I didn't post any pictures,

284
00:10:28,068 --> 00:10:29,326
因为我一个人在家
because I was home alone

285
00:10:29,327 --> 00:10:31,462
看蛇类纪录片
watching a documentary about snakes.

286
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:34,297
大家好 这是贝克特・埃弗雷特
All, this is Beckett Everett.

287
00:10:34,298 --> 00:10:36,366
他名字里有两个特
He's got four t's in his name,

288
00:10:36,408 --> 00:10:39,170
他刚参演了三集"高校利齿"
he just did a three-Episode arc on "High school Fangs."

289
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:40,437
谢谢
Thank you.

290
00:10:40,438 --> 00:10:42,679
天啊 你是新奥尔良十九世纪闪回季
Oh, my God. You were the best part

291
00:10:42,787 --> 00:10:45,107
最精彩的部分
of the new Orleans 1800s flashback season.

292
00:10:45,108 --> 00:10:47,409
的确是 他是第二个詹姆斯・范德・比克
Yes, he was. He's the next James Van der beek,

293
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:50,179
但他会比他更出名很优秀
only he's gonna be even huger and Better.

294
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:53,884
他的头部的比例比詹姆斯当年要匀称
His head is better proportioned than James' was at that age.

295
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,353
克洛伊 你不能找人替代詹姆斯
Chloe, you can't replace James.

296
00:10:56,354 --> 00:10:57,420
是的 我可以
Yes, I can.

297
00:10:57,421 --> 00:10:59,455
我换了我的鞋子 换了我的狗
I replaced my shoes, I replaced my dog,

298
00:10:59,456 --> 00:11:00,656
在你没落地生根前
I replaced my roommate

299
00:11:00,657 --> 00:11:02,291
我还换了我的室友呢
until you put down roots of steel.

300
00:11:02,292 --> 00:11:04,393
超人是根骨惊奇
Superman was the man of steel.

301
00:11:04,394 --> 00:11:06,028
这话真突兀 你为什么要这样说?
That was random. Why would you say that?

302
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:08,566
你的帅气把你脑子堵住了吗?
Did your handsomeness just Leak into your brain?

303
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,033
会发生这种事吗?
Can that happen?

304
00:11:10,034 --> 00:11:11,334
天啊!
Ugh! God!

305
00:11:11,335 --> 00:11:13,469
为什么每个人都不会损人?
Why is everyone So bad at this?

306
00:11:14,115 --> 00:11:16,205
你能给我两百美元让我付话费吗?
Can I have $200 to pay my cell phone bill?

307
00:11:16,206 --> 00:11:18,676
我最近老是打恶作剧电话给凯莉・奥斯本
I've been been prank calling Kelly Osbourne more than usual.

308
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,410
我可没两百美元
I don't have $200.

309
00:11:20,411 --> 00:11:23,281
我只拍了三集"高校利齿"
I've only done, like, three episodes of "H.S.F.,"

310
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,382
我还要养我的母亲
and I'm supporting my mom.

311
00:11:25,383 --> 00:11:27,467
她同时也是我的经纪人
She's also my manager.

312
00:11:27,611 --> 00:11:29,772
我叫她"妈妈经"
I call her my "Momager."

313
00:11:30,543 --> 00:11:31,998
谢谢
Thank you.

314
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:37,798
克洛伊 是我
Hey Chloe, it's me.

315
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,727
我猜你已经交了话费了
I guess you paid your bill,

316
00:11:38,728 --> 00:11:40,196
因为我能给你留言了
because I'm leaving you this message.

317
00:11:40,197 --> 00:11:41,640
我只想问问你还好吗
Just wanted to make sure you're okay,

318
00:11:41,687 --> 00:11:43,098
因为我从昨天开始就没见过你
because I haven't seen you since yesterday

319
00:11:43,099 --> 00:11:45,201
自从你甩开贝克特・埃弗雷特之后
when you stormed out on Beckett Everett...

320
00:11:45,493 --> 00:11:46,969
他名字里有七个字呢
who also has five "E's" in his name.

321
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,206
别人都没注意到
No one else noticed it.

322
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,373
不管怎么样 打给我
Anyway, call me.

323
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:57,756
卢瑟
Luther.

324
00:11:57,827 --> 00:11:59,292
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

325
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:03,517
我看到了些东西 我十分矛盾
I've seen something, and I'm conflicted.

326
00:12:03,518 --> 00:12:06,089
我不知道该怎么做或怎么感受
I don't know what to do or how to feel.

327
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,425
我...你要进来吗?
I... do you want to come in?

328
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:08,712
我不...
I don't...

329
00:12:09,135 --> 00:12:10,558
想
think so.

330
00:12:10,969 --> 00:12:12,263
你至少把外套脱了吧?
Do you at least want to take off your coat?

331
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:13,263
不
No.

332
00:12:13,264 --> 00:12:14,704
不
No.

333
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,365
天啊
Oh, god.

334
00:12:15,366 --> 00:12:17,401
克洛伊出什么事了吗?
Did something happen to Chloe?

335
00:12:17,402 --> 00:12:18,401
嗯
Mm-hmm.

336
00:12:18,448 --> 00:12:20,353
她和詹姆斯绝交之后发疯了??
Did she spiral out without James?

337
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,530
她进监狱了? 她死了吗?
Is she in jail? Is she dead?

338
00:12:22,557 --> 00:12:23,818
她死在大马路上了?
Is she dead in the street?

339
00:12:24,228 --> 00:12:25,795
不
Unh-Unh.

340
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:30,026
我.. 我只是...
I... I just...

341
00:12:30,068 --> 00:12:31,381
我不...
I don't...

342
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:35,630
克洛伊找了份工作
Chloe has a job

343
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,882
在闪闪手机店上班?
working at gloss mobile?

344
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,467
太糟糕了
It's awful.

345
00:12:41,859 --> 00:12:43,099
但是也...
But also...

346
00:12:43,635 --> 00:12:45,524
有点搞笑
kind of funny.

347
00:12:46,067 --> 00:12:49,780
就像一个龙卷风袭击了一个香蕉工厂
Like a tornado ripping through a banana factory.

348
00:12:50,347 --> 00:12:51,534
我在视频网上看到的
I saw it on youtube.

349
00:12:52,127 --> 00:12:53,895
人和香蕉
People and bananas,

350
00:12:53,925 --> 00:12:56,838
转啊转...
swirling and swirling...

351
00:12:58,815 --> 00:13:00,310
真悲哀
It's sad.

352
00:13:03,622 --> 00:13:05,630
她在干嘛? 快点
What is she doing? Come on.

353
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,188
- 我们得进去和她谈谈 - 不
- We gotta go in and talk to her. - Mnh-Mnh.

354
00:13:08,317 --> 00:13:10,248
我要先理清思绪再行动
I don't act until I know how I feel.

355
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,254
当我试图把自己丢进我妈的棺材里
I learned that lesson when I tried to throw myself

356
00:13:12,255 --> 00:13:14,024
我才得到这个教训
into my mother's Coffin. Mm.

357
00:13:20,593 --> 00:13:21,810
克洛伊?
Chloe?

358
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,658
呃... 你...
Um... do you...

359
00:13:26,703 --> 00:13:29,705
在闪闪手机店上班?
work here at... at... gloss Mobile?

360
00:13:29,706 --> 00:13:31,875
抱歉 你得拿个预约号
I'm sorry. You're gonna have to take a number.

361
00:13:31,876 --> 00:13:34,977
但是... 这里没人
But... there's no one else around.

362
00:13:34,978 --> 00:13:35,978
拿号码 女士
Number, ma'am.

363
00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:41,217
九号!
9!

364
00:13:41,218 --> 00:13:43,085
十号!
10!

365
00:13:43,086 --> 00:13:45,354
十号?
10?

366
00:13:45,355 --> 00:13:46,989
- 十一号! - 我是十一号
- 11! - I'm 11.

367
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,659
你好 欢迎光临闪闪手机店
Hi. Welcome to gloss mobile.

368
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,694
请问我能帮您什么吗
How can I help you?

369
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:52,262
你想为你的手机设备加个配饰吗?
Are you interested in an accessory for your device today?

370
00:13:52,263 --> 00:13:53,829
克洛伊
Chloe,

371
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,196
你在这里干嘛?
what are you doing here?

372
00:13:55,197 --> 00:13:56,998
我不知道 我过来付话费
I don't know. I came in to pay my bill,

373
00:13:56,999 --> 00:13:59,601
然后我因为通话累计市场去了客服中心
and I got into it with customer service about rollover minutes,

374
00:13:59,602 --> 00:14:01,204
之后我就在这儿上班了
and the next thing you know I was working here.

375
00:14:01,205 --> 00:14:03,906
是因为...你需要钱吗
Is this because... You need money

376
00:14:03,907 --> 00:14:04,780
自从你和詹姆斯...
since you and James...

377
00:14:04,814 --> 00:14:06,608
阿朱 这和钱没任何关系
June, this has nothing to do with money.

378
00:14:06,609 --> 00:14:09,010
弄钱的办法我多得是
I have plenty of scams to generate money.

379
00:14:09,011 --> 00:14:10,347
我在这里是因为... 我热爱这儿
I'm here because...  I love it.

380
00:14:10,348 --> 00:14:12,014
你叫十号了吗?
Um, did you call 10?

381
00:14:12,015 --> 00:14:13,882
叫了两次 我已经跳到十一号了
Twice. I've moved on to 11.

382
00:14:13,883 --> 00:14:15,750
你应该待在附近的
You're supposed to stay within the vicinity.

383
00:14:15,751 --> 00:14:17,018
我就站在这里
I was standing right over there.

384
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:17,828
我没有听到你叫十号
I didn't hear you call 10.

385
00:14:17,828 --> 00:14:19,391
真神奇啊你是十
Ironic that you'd be a 10,

386
00:14:19,403 --> 00:14:21,056
你明显只值两分
seeing as how you're clearly a 2.

387
00:14:21,057 --> 00:14:23,231
对于一个有刘海的成年女性 你真有自信
You're awfully confident for a grown woman with Bangs.

388
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,397
让我猜猜你为什么会在这儿
Let me guess why you're here.

389
00:14:24,426 --> 00:14:25,727
是不是当你在爱抚你的香肠和葡萄时
You dropped your phone in the toilet

390
00:14:25,728 --> 00:14:27,612
把手机掉马桶里了?
while caressing your hot dog and grapes?

391
00:14:27,675 --> 00:14:30,205
这两个食物根本不应该放一起
Ew. Those foods don't even go together.

392
00:14:30,549 --> 00:14:31,646
我要交换载体
I'm gonna switch carriers.

393
00:14:31,692 --> 00:14:32,934
哈! 祝你好运
Ha! Good luck with that.

394
00:14:32,935 --> 00:14:34,496
回去看看你的合同 这是归我们的
Check your contract. We own your ass.

395
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,107
啊 真满足
Ahh. So satisfying.

396
00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:41,142
克洛伊 我想我知道这是为什么了
Chloe, I think I know what's happening here.

397
00:14:41,143 --> 00:14:42,911
你和客人对骂
You are trading insults with customers

398
00:14:42,912 --> 00:14:44,946
是因为你想念和詹姆斯对骂的感觉
because you miss doing that with James.

399
00:14:44,947 --> 00:14:47,215
不 我知道这看起来不像我
No. I know it doesn't seem like me.

400
00:14:47,216 --> 00:14:49,184
但我真的认为我找到了合适我的工作
But I really think I found my niche--

401
00:14:49,185 --> 00:14:50,320
我在培训中学到这个词的
I learned that word in training.

402
00:14:50,321 --> 00:14:52,254
我爱闪闪手机店
I love glo-Mo.

403
00:14:52,255 --> 00:14:53,922
我这个礼拜要求上九十小时的班
I signed up for 90 hours this week.

404
00:14:53,923 --> 00:14:55,256
我想要上更多
I tried to sign up for more,

405
00:14:55,257 --> 00:14:56,658
但显然 他们也只开那么久
but apparently, that's all they're open.

406
00:14:56,659 --> 00:14:58,595
怪不得中国人要超越我们了
I mean, no wonder the Chinese are beating us.

407
00:14:58,596 --> 00:14:59,562
十二号!
12!

408
00:15:00,563 --> 00:15:02,831
我是十二号到二十五号
I'm numbers 12 through 25.

409
00:15:02,832 --> 00:15:06,334
我有很多问题
I have a lot of questions.

410
00:15:09,696 --> 00:15:11,353
等等 奇怪了
Wait, I'm confused.

411
00:15:11,405 --> 00:15:13,836
克洛伊有了工作不应该是件好事吗?
Isn't it a good thing that Chloe has a job?

412
00:15:13,975 --> 00:15:15,360
她显然很伤心
She's clearly hurting.

413
00:15:15,485 --> 00:15:17,885
克洛伊不是那种拿薪水的人
Chloe isn't the kind of person who gets a paycheck,

414
00:15:17,886 --> 00:15:20,282
也不是那种中午会用微波炉加热东西的人
or who heats things up in the microwave at lunch.

415
00:15:20,308 --> 00:15:21,541
这些事
This is the kind of thing

416
00:15:21,542 --> 00:15:24,313
是她全力避免的
that she spent her whole life trying to avoid.

417
00:15:24,536 --> 00:15:25,947
她人生到了谷底
This is her rock bottom.

418
00:15:26,224 --> 00:15:28,157
你以一个非常戏剧化的方式
You're describing really normal things

419
00:15:28,174 --> 00:15:29,617
描述了非常平常的事
in a really dramatic way.

420
00:15:30,131 --> 00:15:33,000
她穿着褶裥裤
She was wearing pleated pants.

421
00:15:33,001 --> 00:15:34,869
还有她的鞋子
And her shoes...

422
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,536
天哪 她的鞋...
my god, her shoes...

423
00:15:36,537 --> 00:15:40,507
畸形 纯黑 一如黑夜般死板
orthopedics. Solid black. Dead as night.

424
00:15:40,508 --> 00:15:42,342
你知道这是什么吗?
You know what this is?

425
00:15:42,343 --> 00:15:44,310
是没了詹姆斯的克洛伊
This is Chloe in a beek-Less world.

426
00:15:48,725 --> 00:15:50,451
伊莱 你好吗?
Eli. Are you okay?

427
00:15:52,305 --> 00:15:54,888
我看到了...
I've seen something...

428
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:58,925
我刚在艺术展 你们都迟到了
I was at my art show, which you're all late for, by the way.

429
00:15:58,926 --> 00:16:01,161
我看见了...
I saw it, and...

430
00:16:01,162 --> 00:16:05,565
我不得不来找你们 我...
I had to leave and come find you. I just...

431
00:16:05,566 --> 00:16:07,868
我也不知道
I don't know.

432
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:20,035
嘿 朋友们
Hey guys.

433
00:16:20,515 --> 00:16:24,217
我的天啊 詹姆斯成了个大肥仔
Oh, my. James is a giant Peach.

434
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:28,188
没错 我知道
Yes, I know.

435
00:16:28,796 --> 00:16:30,856
我... 自从上次见面后我胖了一点
I... put on a little weight since the last time I saw you.

436
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:32,593
我两天前刚和你吃过饭
I just had dinner with you two days ago.

437
00:16:32,594 --> 00:16:34,561
是的 我... 我胖起来略快
Yeah. I'm... I'm a quick fat.

438
00:16:34,562 --> 00:16:36,862
我开心的时候 就会像这样胖起来
When I'm happy, I tend to put on weight like that.

439
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,298
但没关系 艾米丽不介意
But it's okay. Emily doesn't mind.

440
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:41,300
是吗 小艾 让他们看看你怎么摸我肚子的
No. Right, Em? Show them how you rub my belly.

441
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:43,171
我觉得他很可爱
Oh, I think he's adorable.

442
00:16:43,386 --> 00:16:45,572
他是我的圆滚滚胖小子
He's my jiggly wiggly jigglepuss.

443
00:16:45,573 --> 00:16:49,009
- 我去拿些芝士块 - 好
- I'll get some cheese cubes. - All right.

444
00:16:50,812 --> 00:16:51,609
告诉你们
Ahh! I tell you,

445
00:16:51,638 --> 00:16:55,516
我觉得我和艾米丽在一起太舒服了
I just feel so comfortable with Emily, with myself.

446
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:57,017
我...
It just...

447
00:16:57,454 --> 00:16:59,645
做自己的感觉真棒
I just feel good in my own body.

448
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,222
但是 詹姆斯...
But, James...

449
00:17:02,223 --> 00:17:02,992
你是个演员
Y-You're an actor.

450
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,424
你不... 不担心自己的演艺生涯吗
Aren't... aren't you worried about your career?

451
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:08,194
当然不是 许多优秀的演员都有过体重问题
Nah. Many fine actors have had dramatic weight gains

452
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:10,098
但也都没影响工作
and just kept right on Working.

453
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:12,499
方・基默
Uh, Val Kilmer,

454
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,200
文斯・沃恩 史蒂芬・席格
Vince Vaughn, Steven seagal.

455
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:16,504
我觉得这三个人都胖得无法直视
I find all three of those people hard to look at.

456
00:17:16,505 --> 00:17:19,973
这里是属于伊莱和他的展品的 别光顾着聊我
Anyway, this isn't about me. This is about Eli and his show.

457
00:17:19,974 --> 00:17:21,309
是不? 你看这!
Right? I mean, look at this!

458
00:17:22,536 --> 00:17:25,400
詹姆斯是在分散自己的注意力
James is voluntarily deflecting attention from himself.

459
00:17:25,481 --> 00:17:27,347
他的人生也到了谷底
This is his rock bottom.

460
00:17:27,348 --> 00:17:30,517
那一定是伊莱的妈妈
That has got to be Eli's mother.

461
00:17:30,518 --> 00:17:32,052
简直就是穿裙子的伊莱
It's Eli in a dress.

462
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,523
抱歉 我来晚了
Hey. Sorry, I'm late.

463
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:39,060
我不能提早下班
I couldn't leave work early

464
00:17:39,061 --> 00:17:42,396
因为经理拉杰这人实在太难搞
because my manager raj is being a real hard ass.

465
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,583
不过我还挺尊敬他
but I respect him.

466
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:57,277
快看 他们又在一起了
Look. They're back together.

467
00:17:57,278 --> 00:17:59,078
他们意识到没有了彼此 自己就一团糟
They realized what a mess they are without each other

468
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,415
他们会好好谈谈的
and they're gonna talk.

469
00:18:01,322 --> 00:18:03,561
你的尼龙扣弯了
Your velcro's crooked.

470
00:18:04,118 --> 00:18:05,552
谢谢
Thanks.

471
00:18:05,553 --> 00:18:06,888
你长白头发了
You've got frosting in your hair.

472
00:18:06,889 --> 00:18:09,356
噢 我之前就开始长了
Oh. I-I had frosting earlier.

473
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:11,492
这就结束了?
That's it?

474
00:18:11,493 --> 00:18:12,959
不会吧
That can't be it.

475
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,527
算了 我等不了了
You know what? I'm done.

476
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:16,061
我不会傻站在这
I'm not gonna stand back here

477
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:19,200
看着他们抛弃这段美好的友情
and watch them throw away this beautiful friendship.

478
00:18:19,201 --> 00:18:21,234
我再也不玩中立了
No more being neutral.

479
00:18:21,235 --> 00:18:23,069
我选我的妈妈和爸爸
I choose mom and Dad.

480
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,172
嘿 听着
Hey, look.

481
00:18:25,173 --> 00:18:26,539
你们是朋友
You guys are friends,

482
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,142
所以你们得表现得像一对朋友
so you should be acting like it.

483
00:18:28,143 --> 00:18:30,010
看看你们俩!
I mean, look at each other!

484
00:18:30,879 --> 00:18:33,447
克洛伊 你应该说些什么...
Chloe, you should say something...

485
00:18:33,448 --> 00:18:35,548
比如 说他胖
I don't know, like, fat to him.

486
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:37,118
然后是你 詹姆斯 你也应该说些什么
And then, James, you should say something

487
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:39,419
说闪闪手机店有多逊
about how lame gloss mobile is.

488
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,187
然后 克洛伊 你会说"是吗?
Then, Chloe, You'll be all like, "Well, you know what?

489
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:43,489
你真是胖得超乎想象"
You're even fatter than I said you were before."

490
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,858
然后詹姆斯会说"是吗?
And then James will be all like, "Well, you know what?

491
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:48,060
我至少跑得比闪闪店的数据传输要快"
I'm faster than glo-Mo data transfers."

492
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:50,396
克洛伊又会说"那你对与布莱恩・丹内利
And then Chloe will be like, "Well, what is it like

493
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:53,165
争夺同一个角色有何感想?"
competing against Brian Dennehy for roles?"

494
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,801
詹姆斯又会说"那你和蕾丝们比谁穿衬衫
and then James will be all like, "Oh, well, what is it like

495
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,939
漂亮又感觉如何"
competing against lesbians For shirts?"

496
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,908
你来我往! 互相羞辱! 扯皮! 嘲笑!
Back and forth! Insults! Tears! Laughter!

497
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:03,176
最好再抱抱?
Hugging?

498
00:19:03,177 --> 00:19:06,947
没错! 他们抱了起来!
Yes! They're hugging!

499
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,085
她的屁股上沾了黄油
She's got butter on her Butt.

500
00:19:11,086 --> 00:19:12,919
黄油屁股
Butter Butt.

501
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,456
我... 噢 天哪 我刚靠在了伊莱的墙上
I... Oh, god. I was standing against Eli's wall.

502
00:19:16,457 --> 00:19:18,891
她想把它擦掉 却弄到了毛衣上
She's trying to wipe it off. She's got it on her sweater.

503

Sweater butter. Oh, now Luther's gettin' in there.

504
00:19:21,428 --> 00:19:23,431

- Butter Butt rubber. - Butter Butt rubber.

505
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:27,468
行了 过来吧
Okay, come on.

506
00:19:31,405 --> 00:19:33,907
确实 我过得不太好
Obviously, I'm not doing so well.

507
00:19:33,908 --> 00:19:35,509
是啊
Yeah.

508
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,476
我也一样
Me, neither.

509
00:19:36,477 --> 00:19:40,180
这颈笔不错
Nice neck pen.

510
00:19:40,181 --> 00:19:41,315
至少我有个脖子能挂着
At least I have a neck.

511
00:19:44,063 --> 00:19:45,734
我挺怀念这一切
I've missed this.

512
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,553
你是对的 我变得柔弱而又自满
You're right. I got soft and complacent

513
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:49,421
没你在我没那么犀利了
without you around to keep me sharp.

514
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:51,492
我也不想过没有你的日子
I don't wanna live in a beek-Less world.

515
00:19:51,493 --> 00:19:52,826
实在太可怕了
It's too gruesome.

516
00:19:52,827 --> 00:19:56,196
昨天我还填一个叫w-2表格
Yesterday, I had to fill out something called a w-2 form.

517
00:19:56,197 --> 00:19:58,197
每一栏我填的都是"球"
I mean, I wrote the word "Balls" In every section,

518
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,601
但...也得写那么多蛋呢
but still... I had to fill it out.

519
00:20:01,802 --> 00:20:03,270
这是什么?
What is this?

520
00:20:03,271 --> 00:20:05,138
别再戴了
Get rid of this.

521
00:20:05,139 --> 00:20:07,474
抱歉 你戴着吧
Excuse me. There you go.

522
00:20:07,475 --> 00:20:10,478
能给我一杯香槟吗 麻烦你了 谢谢?
Can I have a glass of Champagne, please? Thanks.

523
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:13,046
别再无视我的否决了
Don't ever blow off my veto again.

524
00:20:13,047 --> 00:20:14,346
我觉得我们还是别再玩什么一票否决了
I say we just veto the vetoes.

525
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:16,248
好吧 可以 因为杰夫・戈登联系我了
Okay, good, because Jeff Gordon called.

526
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:17,983
他开车绕完五百圈
He's driving 500 times in a circle

527
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:20,154
要来找我约会
and then he wants to hang out.

528
00:20:21,322 --> 00:20:22,557
你们终于复合了!
Oh, you guys made up!

529
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:25,392
耶! 我又拯救一段感情
Yay! I saved another relationship.

530
00:20:25,393 --> 00:20:27,993
当我让我爸妈重归于好的时候...
You know, when I got my mom and dad back together...

531
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:29,161
这恐龙是由腐臭的黄油做的
You weren't standing 10 feet

532
00:20:29,162 --> 00:20:30,829
你们有本事站这么远
from a dinosaur made of rancid butter,

533
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,364
你们有本事看一眼啊
which you haven't even looked at yet.

534
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:34,302
你们谁都没看过
None of you have looked at it.

535
00:20:34,303 --> 00:20:36,002
还不快看!
Look at it!

536
00:20:39,985 --> 00:20:41,885
运气不错 你瘦得也略快
you're lucky you're a quick thin.

537
00:20:42,148 --> 00:20:43,532
是啊 但过程挺艰辛的
I know. That got rough.

538
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,089
之前洗澡的时候连鸡巴都看不到了
I was having trouble seeing my Dong in the shower.

539
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,658
说得好像以前看得到似的
It's always kind of been hard to see.

540
00:20:48,659 --> 00:20:49,928
是吗 艾米丽?
