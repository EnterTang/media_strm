1
00:00:01,041 --> 00:00:02,309
在印第安纳州时
Back in Indiana,

2
00:00:02,309 --> 00:00:04,111
盥洗室总是一个很私人的地方
the bathroom was always a private place.

3
00:00:04,111 --> 00:00:05,379
但因为我现在在纽约
But now that I live in New York,

4
00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:07,047
一如纽约的其他事物一样 于是也很拥挤
like everything else, it's crowded.

5
00:00:08,215 --> 00:00:09,817
吮指的快乐是什么 鸡肉?
What's finger-lickin', chicken?

6
00:00:09,817 --> 00:00:11,352
没什么 大屁股
Nothin' much, butt.

7
00:00:11,352 --> 00:00:13,087
我只是认为这押韵多了
That rhymed more in my head.

8
00:00:13,087 --> 00:00:14,254
但是我觉得还不错啊
But I'm okay with it.

9
00:00:14,254 --> 00:00:15,823
盥洗室确实成为了我和克洛伊 
The bathroom's actually become a place

10
00:00:15,823 --> 00:00:17,257
交流八卦的地方
where Chloe and I download and catch up.

11
00:00:17,257 --> 00:00:20,294
我想去美黑下
I'm just about to give myself a Brazilian.

12
00:00:20,294 --> 00:00:21,562
你想先试试吗?
Want me to do you first?

13
00:00:21,562 --> 00:00:22,596
不用了 谢谢
No, thanks.

14
00:00:22,596 --> 00:00:23,864
你确定吗 阿朱?
You sure, June?

15
00:00:23,864 --> 00:00:26,066
今年都2013年啦 降低下线咯
It's 2013. Lower the deck.

16
00:00:28,569 --> 00:00:31,004
# 我不完美 我也不打小报告 #
I'm not perfect, I'm no snitch

17
00:00:31,004 --> 00:00:32,573
# 但是我可以告诉你 #
but I can tell you 

18
00:00:32,573 --> 00:00:34,308
# 她是一个... #
She's a...

19
00:00:34,308 --> 00:00:37,010
# 吧哒哒哒哒吧 吧哒吧 #
Ba-Da-Da-Da-Da-Ba, ba-Da-Ba

20
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,812
23号公寓第二季第十七集 占用中

21
00:00:38,812 --> 00:00:41,048
精心修饰给谁看呢?
So, who's the special grooming for?

22
00:00:41,048 --> 00:00:43,350
班吉b结束了洛杉矶的导演工作
Benjamin's back from his directing gig in L.A.

23
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,220
在一部名叫"艾格尼丝"的电影里
He made Joseph Gordon-Levitt kiss Melissa Mccarthy

24
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,588
他安排约瑟夫・高登莱维特去亲梅丽莎・麦卡锡
in a movie I'm really looking forward to seeing

25
00:00:47,588 --> 00:00:48,822
我非常想去看呢
called "Agnes."

26
00:00:48,822 --> 00:00:50,324
听起来很棒
Sounds great.

27
00:00:50,324 --> 00:00:52,960
没错 在他飞回澳大利亚前
Yeah. Now he's directing James in some big new Commercial

28
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,495
他负责给詹姆斯的广告做导演
before he goes to australia.

29
00:00:54,495 --> 00:00:56,497
要知道 这会是迄今我俩共度
You know, this is gonna be the longest amount of time

30
00:00:56,497 --> 00:00:58,298
最漫长的时光了
we've actually ever spent together.

31
00:00:58,298 --> 00:01:00,134
噢! 好棒!
Ooh! That's exciting!

32
00:01:00,134 --> 00:01:02,836
我把他的地位提升到男友圈的首位
Yeah. I bumped him up to number one on my guy rotation.

33
00:01:02,836 --> 00:01:04,872
二号到六号只好在我们翻云覆雨的时候
Numbers two through six are just gonna have to wait

34
00:01:04,872 --> 00:01:06,840
默默等候了
while he puts his dingo in my baby.

35
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,310
克洛伊 你有没有和班吉b讲过男友圈 ?
Chloe, did you tell Benjamin about your rotation?

36
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,845
没有 为什么?
No. Why?

37
00:01:11,845 --> 00:01:14,181
因为不是所有人都会有
Uh, because that's not just something that everyone has.

38
00:01:14,181 --> 00:01:15,549
那每个人都该试试 很不错
Well, everyone should. It's awesome.

39
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:16,984
这是最完美的状况
It's the perfect situation.

40
00:01:16,984 --> 00:01:18,886
没有输家 每个人都是赢家
Nobody loses. Everybody wins.

41
00:01:18,886 --> 00:01:21,822
不是的 有个人输了 
No, one person loses-- The person who thinks

42
00:01:21,822 --> 00:01:23,123
他还以为女友钟情他一个呢
that they're dating someone Exclusively

43
00:01:23,123 --> 00:01:24,858
却发现事实并非如此
and then finds out that's not the case.

44
00:01:24,858 --> 00:01:28,328
就像我在七年级时和艾伦・德迈亚约会
Like me in seventh grade when I was dating Aaron demayo.

45
00:01:28,328 --> 00:01:30,898
他是一名摔跤手 而我是一个平凡的女孩
He was a wrestler, and I was a mat maid--

46
00:01:30,898 --> 00:01:32,866
大家都觉得我不是真正的啦啦队长
Which people don't think is a real cheerleader

47
00:01:32,866 --> 00:01:34,568
因为我们连制服都没有
because we didn't have uniforms,

48
00:01:34,568 --> 00:01:37,938
只能找衣柜里带紫色的衣服穿 权当制服
we just wore whatever shade of purple we had in our closet.

49
00:01:37,938 --> 00:01:40,274
总之 当我发现艾伦还和特瑞沙・费雪约会时
Anyway, I was heartbroken when I found out

50
00:01:40,274 --> 00:01:44,274
我伤心透了
that Aaron was also seeing Theresa Fisher.

51
00:01:46,013 --> 00:01:48,182
难道告诉班吉b我有男友圈
Ugh. Is telling Benjamin about my guy rotation

52
00:01:48,182 --> 00:01:51,185
是唯一能够让你停止叨叨的方法吗?
the only way I'm gonna get you to stop with the jibber-jabber?

53
00:01:51,185 --> 00:01:52,186
是的
It is.

54
00:01:52,186 --> 00:01:54,087
好吧 愿上帝帮助我
Fine. But so help me god,

55
00:01:54,087 --> 00:01:56,824
如果我再听到一点叽叽 甚至一点喳喳
if I hear one jibber or even a piece of jabber,

56
00:01:56,824 --> 00:01:58,892
我就会强行给你上美黑蜡 
I will forcibly wax you. Mm.

57
00:02:01,995 --> 00:02:04,898
很漂亮的盥洗室 那这广告是关于什么产品?
Sweet bathroom. What's this commercial for, anyway?

58
00:02:04,898 --> 00:02:07,234
毛巾? 肥皂? 喷头?
Towels? Soap? Shower heads?

59
00:02:07,234 --> 00:02:08,235
太阳眼镜
Sunglasses.

60
00:02:08,235 --> 00:02:09,603
太酷了 我会看看的
Awesome. I'm watching.

61
00:02:09,603 --> 00:02:10,604
啊 实际上 你不可能会看到
Ah, you won't be able to watch, actually.

62
00:02:10,604 --> 00:02:11,872
这则广告只在日本播出
It's Only gonna air in Japan.

63
00:02:11,872 --> 00:02:12,973
自从三个打扮成凯蒂猫的女孩
James is Huge there

64
00:02:12,973 --> 00:02:14,842
{\an8}注: 该片由詹姆斯出演

65
00:02:12,973 --> 00:02:14,842
在"校园蓝调"的京都首映式里 
ever since Three girls dressed as hello Kitty

66
00:02:14,842 --> 00:02:15,943
被踩踏致死后
were trampled to death

67
00:02:15,943 --> 00:02:18,378
詹姆斯在日本就声名赫赫了
at the "Varsity Blues" premiere in Kyoto.

68
00:02:23,016 --> 00:02:24,184
嘿
Hey.

69
00:02:24,184 --> 00:02:25,452
嘿 你自己?
Hey yourself?

70
00:02:25,452 --> 00:02:26,453
我同时和另外五个男人约会
I'm dating five other guys.

71
00:02:26,453 --> 00:02:28,856
我的男友圈里已经有六位男人了
I've got six guys in my rotation.

72
00:02:28,856 --> 00:02:30,557
你在开玩笑吧
You're kidding.

73
00:02:30,557 --> 00:02:32,259
我同时和另外五个女人约会
I'm dating five other girls,

74
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:33,861
但是我们把它称为"情人环"
except we call it a "Cycle."

75
00:02:33,861 --> 00:02:34,895
噢 我的天 真有趣
Oh, my God. That is so funny.

76
00:02:34,895 --> 00:02:36,497
澳大利人对所有事情都有不同的词语
Australians have different words for everything.

77
00:02:36,497 --> 00:02:38,565
确实 和六个人约会难道不是最棒的吗?
We do. Isn't dating six people the best?

78
00:02:38,565 --> 00:02:40,033
因为五个无法令人满足...
Because five is unsatisfying...

79
00:02:40,033 --> 00:02:41,835
应付七个人又精力不够
and seven allows no time to recoup.

80
00:02:41,835 --> 00:02:44,271
我才想起我为什么喜欢你
I just remembered why I like you.

81
00:02:44,271 --> 00:02:45,472
- 你是那么的... - 性感?
- You are so... - hot?

82
00:02:45,472 --> 00:02:47,140
我想说的是"放荡"
I was gonna say "Slutty."

83
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:50,544
我喜欢拍摄工作的第一天
Love the first day of production.

84
00:02:50,544 --> 00:02:53,046
整组的人员都会喜爱我 尊重我
A whole new crew to love and respect me.

85
00:02:53,046 --> 00:02:54,848
你知道我最喜爱的是哪部分吗?
You know what my favorite part is?

86
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,550
工具腰带吗?
All the tool belts?

87
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,551
不是
No.

88
00:02:57,551 --> 00:02:58,986
首天的开机演说
First day of production speech.

89
00:02:58,986 --> 00:03:00,420
我向全组人介绍自己
I introduce myself to the crew,

90
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,989
说一些鼓舞人心的话
say a few inspirational words,

91
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:03,891
记下一两个姓名 彰显我的平易近人
learn two of their names to show how accessible I am,

92
00:03:03,891 --> 00:03:06,994
然后休息 沉湎于他们的钦佩中
then sit back and bask in their admiration.

93
00:03:06,994 --> 00:03:09,830
这些好比燃料 让我动力十足
It's my fuel. Keeps me running.

94
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,833
- 每天我都能够从你那学到东西 - 嗯
- Every day, I learn from you. - Mm.

95
00:03:13,834 --> 00:03:14,935
好的 大家!
All right, everyone!

96
00:03:14,935 --> 00:03:18,071
我是班吉b・拉夫特 你们的导演
Um, I'm Benjamin Lovett, your director.

97
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:20,407
在我们开工之前我想要说几句
Just wanna say a few words before we start.

98
00:03:20,407 --> 00:03:22,809
我知道你们中的某些人正在想
Now I know some of you may be wondering

99
00:03:22,809 --> 00:03:26,146
为什么要在盥洗室里拍太阳眼镜广告
why we're doing a commercial for sunglasses in a bathroom.

100
00:03:26,146 --> 00:03:28,048
特别是你俩 乔尔和米奇
Especially you, Joel, Mikey.

101
00:03:28,048 --> 00:03:29,516
两个名字
Two names.

102
00:03:29,516 --> 00:03:33,554
但盥洗室里度过的时光多么漫长
But so much of life happens in bathrooms,

103
00:03:33,554 --> 00:03:36,390
许许多多亲密无间 意义非凡的时刻
so many intimate and important moments.

104
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,457
想一想...
Think about it--

105
00:03:37,457 --> 00:03:39,860
什么时候最不设防?
When are you most vulnerable?

106
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,861
当你赤身裸体
When you're naked.

107
00:03:40,861 --> 00:03:42,996
在哪里你总是赤身裸体?
And where are you most naked?

108
00:03:42,996 --> 00:03:44,898
在盥洗室里
In the bathroom.

109
00:03:44,898 --> 00:03:46,199
嗯
Mm.

110
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:49,002
一丝不挂... 很性感
And being naked... is sexy,

111
00:03:49,002 --> 00:03:52,539
太阳眼镜... 也很性感
and sunglasses... are sexy.

112
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:56,543
所以我们要让盥洗室... 性感起来...
So we're gonna make this bathroom... sexy...

113
00:03:56,543 --> 00:03:58,478
迷蒙起来...
and steamy...

114
00:03:58,478 --> 00:04:01,014
湿气氤氲
and wet.

115
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:04,484
因为盥洗室就等于性感...
Because bathrooms equals sexy...

116
00:04:04,484 --> 00:04:07,588
等于太阳眼镜
equals sunglasses.

117
00:04:07,588 --> 00:04:08,589
谢谢大家
Thank you.

118
00:04:11,224 --> 00:04:13,327
我不能接着说
I can't follow that.

119
00:04:13,327 --> 00:04:14,494
一天不能有两个...
You can't have two...

120
00:04:14,494 --> 00:04:16,597
鼓舞人心的首日开机演说
Inspiring first day of production speeches.

121
00:04:16,597 --> 00:04:18,231
这个畜生篡取了我的权利
The S.O.B. usurped me.

122
00:04:18,231 --> 00:04:20,567
他"彗星美人"了你
He "All about Eve'd" you.

123
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:21,568
什么?
What?

124
00:04:21,568 --> 00:04:24,204
噢 抱歉 他"广告女郎"了你
Oh. Sorry. He "Showgirl'd" you.

125
00:04:25,238 --> 00:04:27,474
他讲得比你好
He did better than you did.

126
00:04:27,474 --> 00:04:28,475
啊
Uhh.

127
00:04:28,475 --> 00:04:31,478
嘿 我真的喜欢你的演说
Hey. I really liked your speech.

128
00:04:31,478 --> 00:04:33,413
噢? 哪一部分?
Oh, yeah? Which part?

129
00:04:33,413 --> 00:04:35,983
# 我不在乎 #
I don't care

130
00:04:35,983 --> 00:04:37,918
# 我就喜欢 #
I love it

131
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:40,120
# 我不在乎 #
I don't care

132
00:04:41,888 --> 00:04:43,557
有人在这里! 占用中!
Someone is in here! Ocupado!

133
00:04:43,557 --> 00:04:46,026
阿朱 我们在这座城市的所有盥洗室里做爱
June, we're having sex in bathrooms all across the city.

134
00:04:46,026 --> 00:04:47,160
刚从一家熟食店回来
We just came from a deli.

135
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,528
我们给一些挫老头演了一场真人秀
We gave some old fakaktas a show.

136
00:04:48,528 --> 00:04:50,564
你们为什么要在盥洗室里做爱?
Ew. Why are you having sex in bathrooms?

137
00:04:50,564 --> 00:04:53,233
告诉她 阿班 用澳大利亚口音告诉她
Tell her, Ben. Tell her in the australian accent.

138
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:55,335
因为盥洗室是那么的性感
Because bathrooms are sexy.

139
00:04:55,335 --> 00:04:56,370
哼!
Mmm!

140
00:04:58,905 --> 00:05:00,540
我的化妆台!
My prep station!

141
00:05:01,408 --> 00:05:03,577
好吧 你到底有没有和他说...
Well, did you at least tell him about--

142
00:05:03,577 --> 00:05:05,479
我的男友圈? 说了 他一点都不介意
my rotation? Yeah, he's totally cool with it.

143
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:07,047
我也有情人环
I have one, too. A cycle.

144
00:05:07,047 --> 00:05:10,417
好吧 只要你俩一直步调一致...
Well, good. I guess as long as you two are on the same page...

145
00:05:10,417 --> 00:05:11,852
阿朱 现在你站的地方
June, some sex is about to happen

146
00:05:11,852 --> 00:05:13,954
一场床戏正要上演 所以你要么加入要么出去
right where you're standing, so either get in or get out.

147
00:05:13,954 --> 00:05:16,923
但是我还没化完妆 我还在化我的左眼
But I'm not finished yet. I'm still doing my left eye.

148
00:05:16,923 --> 00:05:17,924
噢 天呐!
Oh, god!

149
00:05:17,924 --> 00:05:19,593
# 我不在乎 #
I don't care

150
00:05:19,593 --> 00:05:21,495
# 我就喜欢 #
I love it 

151
00:05:21,495 --> 00:05:23,096
# 我不在乎 #
I don't care

152
00:05:23,096 --> 00:05:25,432
二十四小时里在十二套盥洗室里搞?
12 Bathrooms in 24 hours?

153
00:05:25,432 --> 00:05:26,433
如果这都不算新纪录的话
if that's not a record,

154
00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:29,236
那我真要会会能赢过我们的混蛋了
I'd like to meet the bastards who beat us.

155
00:05:29,236 --> 00:05:31,104
我要在这里待一个月
You know, I'm gonna be here for a month.

156
00:05:31,104 --> 00:05:33,373
我们可以 放慢节奏
We might want to... pace ourselves.

157
00:05:33,373 --> 00:05:35,275
我榨干你了吗?
Oh, am I wearing you out?

158
00:05:35,275 --> 00:05:37,944
你这老男人累瘫了? 要不要来点薄荷提神?
Is the old man getting tired? Do you want a peppermint?

159
00:05:38,945 --> 00:05:41,515
我只是说偶尔呢
I'm just saying, at some point,

160
00:05:41,515 --> 00:05:42,983
可以穿上衣服
we might have to put some clothes on

161
00:05:42,983 --> 00:05:45,452
用嘴巴吃点食物
and use our mouths for food.

162
00:05:45,452 --> 00:05:46,353
我知道一家脱衣舞酒吧
I know a strip club

163
00:05:46,353 --> 00:05:48,422
他们家中式鸡肉沙拉做得不错
that has a great chinese chicken salad.

164
00:05:48,422 --> 00:05:50,424
听起来既恶心又好吃 那就走吧
That sounds gross and delicious at the same time. Let's go.

165
00:05:53,427 --> 00:05:54,394
啊!
Whoa!

166
00:05:54,394 --> 00:05:57,364
噢 不 班吉b
Oh, no. Benjamin.

167
00:05:57,364 --> 00:06:00,033
你的肩膀似乎脱臼了
Seems like you've got a dislocated shoulder.

168
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:01,868
我看你躺在这里
Now that I see you lying here,

169
00:06:01,868 --> 00:06:03,403
才想起来我应该
I realize what I should have done--

170
00:06:03,403 --> 00:06:04,504
放一片丝瓜在你的鸡鸡上
Instead of covering you with a towel,

171
00:06:04,504 --> 00:06:06,339
而不是拿条毛巾把你盖起来
I should have put a small loofah over your junk.

172
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:07,841
那应该很搞笑
That would have been very funny.

173
00:06:07,841 --> 00:06:10,811
我真后悔没那么做
I regret not doing that very much.

174
00:06:10,811 --> 00:06:12,412
那么我们现在要送你去医院
So we just gotta get you to the hospital.

175
00:06:12,412 --> 00:06:14,414
我需要你的基本资料
I'm just gonna need some info first.

176
00:06:14,414 --> 00:06:16,483
- 出生日期? - 1982年4月28号
- What's your date of birth? - April 28, 1982.

177
00:06:16,483 --> 00:06:18,418
是否有过敏史?
Any allergies?

178
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:21,821
除了眼前这个小尤物?
Other than this hot potato right here?

179
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:24,591
有紧急联系人吗?
An "in case of an emergency" contact?

180
00:06:24,591 --> 00:06:26,493
梅琳达・圣・克莱尔 二一二
Melinda St. Claire, 2-1-2...

181
00:06:26,493 --> 00:06:28,261
梅琳达・圣・克莱尔? 那是谁?
Melinda St. Claire? Who's that?

182
00:06:28,261 --> 00:06:30,430
哦 她是我的情人环头一号
Oh, she's the number one girl in my cycle.

183
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,499
真有趣
That's so funny.

184
00:06:32,499 --> 00:06:35,202
在加拿大 我们称之为炮友链
In Canada, we call it a loop.

185
00:06:41,808 --> 00:06:44,211
你好 朋友
Hello, friend.

186
00:06:44,211 --> 00:06:46,813
我收到你的信息了
I got your message.

187
00:06:48,281 --> 00:06:50,484
# 你一定要让徘徊吗? #
do you have to let it linger?

188
00:06:50,484 --> 00:06:51,818
这是什么?
What the hell is this?

189
00:06:51,818 --> 00:06:53,792
我知道你嘴上说不在乎
I know you said it doesn't bother you

190
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:56,461
梅琳达・圣・克莱尔是阿班的情人环的首位
that Melinda St. Claire is number one in Ben's cycle.

191
00:06:56,461 --> 00:06:59,130
但是你不能装作你不难过
But you can't pretend that you're not feeling hurt.

192
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:02,734
他是你的第一位 而你不是他的
He's your number one, and you're not his.

193
00:07:02,734 --> 00:07:04,869
这太伤人了
That is jacked up.

194
00:07:04,869 --> 00:07:06,871
阿朱 我已经去找我男友圈的其他人了
June, I've already moved on to other guys in my rotation.

195
00:07:06,871 --> 00:07:08,707
- 我一点都不在乎 - 嘘!
- I don't really care. - Shh!

196
00:07:08,707 --> 00:07:11,609
就让这首伤心情歌来为你疗伤
Just let the perfect breakup song heal your wounds.

197
00:07:11,609 --> 00:07:13,144
把你的手指从我脸上拿开
Take your finger off my face.

198
00:07:13,144 --> 00:07:15,113
对不起 有点过了
Sorry. That was too much.

199
00:07:15,113 --> 00:07:18,149
阿朱 我不在乎阿班怎么来排他的情人环
June, I don't care how Ben ranks his cycle.

200
00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:20,151
为什么你认为我同时和六个男人拍拖?
Why do you think I date six guys at a time?

201
00:07:20,151 --> 00:07:21,953
就是因为这个原因呢
For exactly this reason.

202
00:07:21,953 --> 00:07:23,555
厌倦了一个 就立马找下一个
One gets annoying, another one slips right in.

203
00:07:23,555 --> 00:07:24,556
这就是帕特・莱利管理尼克斯队的方法
It's how Pat Riley ran the knicks.

204
00:07:24,556 --> 00:07:25,890
也是我安排我性生活的规则
It's how I run my sex life.

205
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,625
我不信你在说实话
I don't think you're being honest with yourself.

206
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:31,463
新男人不能帮助你忘记班吉b
and another guy isn't gonna help you get over Benjamin.

207
00:07:31,463 --> 00:07:32,564
你必须伤心哀悼
You have to mourn,

208
00:07:32,564 --> 00:07:34,466
并且你一定要吃冰激凌
and you have to eat ice cream,

209
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:36,835
你还得做一个神龛
and you have to build a shrine.

210
00:07:36,835 --> 00:07:38,403
我七年级的时候就是这么做的
That's what I did in seventh grade

211
00:07:38,403 --> 00:07:41,406
那时我和艾伦・德迈亚 分手了
when me and Aaron demayo broke up.

212
00:07:41,406 --> 00:07:43,808
# 你一定要让它徘徊吗? #
Do you have to let it linger?

213
00:07:43,808 --> 00:07:46,878
# 你一定要吗 一定要这样吗 #
Do you have to, do you have to

214
00:07:46,878 --> 00:07:49,447
# 你一定要让它徘徊吗? #
do you have to let it linger?

215
00:07:49,447 --> 00:07:50,849
宝贝 我们知道你在伤心
Honey, we know you're hurting,

216
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:52,951
但这首神烦的歌我真是听够了
but enough of this gosh-Darned song.

217
00:07:52,951 --> 00:07:55,720
唐纳德 不要用愤怒的口气谈论神
Donald, do not almost say "God" in anger.

218
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,523
这能让你感觉好起来
This will make you feel so much better.

219
00:07:58,523 --> 00:08:01,025
# 你一定要让它徘徊吗? #
Do you have to let it linger?

220
00:08:01,025 --> 00:08:03,395
# 一定要吗 一定要这样吗 #
Do you have to, do you have to

221
00:08:03,395 --> 00:08:06,464
# 你一定要让它流逝吗 #
do you have to let it linger?

222
00:08:06,464 --> 00:08:09,067
我和阿尔文老在麦霸之夜唱这首歌
My friend Alvin and I would perform that at open mic night,

223
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:12,103
然后我们会...# 毁了它 #
and we would...  crush it

224
00:08:12,103 --> 00:08:13,605
他现在死了
he's dead now.

225
00:08:16,174 --> 00:08:18,943
好好享用你的咖啡 承蒙詹姆斯・范德・比克的好意
Please enjoy your coffee, courtesy of James Van Der Beek.

226
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:21,379
给阿乔来杯乔家咖啡
A Cup O'Joe from a regular Joe.

227
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:23,448
希望这能赢得他们的好感
Hope this finally wins their admiration.

228
00:08:23,448 --> 00:08:25,116
对我来说管用
Well, it's working for me.

229
00:08:25,116 --> 00:08:26,551
我好久没喝玛奇朵了
I haven't had a macchiato in ages,

230
00:08:26,551 --> 00:08:28,086
我忙死了
and I am buzzing.

231
00:08:28,086 --> 00:08:30,121
詹姆斯 谢谢你的咖啡
James. Thanks for the coffee.

232
00:08:30,121 --> 00:08:31,856
不客气
Hey. No problem.

233
00:08:31,856 --> 00:08:33,758
我们打篮球不够人 你要来吗?
Hey, we need a fourth for basketball. You want in?

234
00:08:33,758 --> 00:08:36,494
在我们等阿班的时候
Oh. You know, I really should memorize my lines

235
00:08:36,494 --> 00:08:37,462
我真该去背台词
while we're waiting for Ben,

236
00:08:37,462 --> 00:08:39,831
但为了你们 为了我们团队...
but for you guys, for my crew...

237
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:43,568
走吧 球员
Let's go, ballers.

238
00:08:43,568 --> 00:08:44,736
太好了
Yeah. All right.

239
00:08:44,736 --> 00:08:46,004
各位 不好意思我迟到了
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.

240
00:08:46,004 --> 00:08:47,105
发生了什么事?
What happened?

241
00:08:47,105 --> 00:08:49,974
我...嘿咻的时候受伤了
I, uh, injured myself during sex.

242
00:08:49,974 --> 00:08:52,644
是啊
Yeah, you did.

243
00:08:52,644 --> 00:08:54,112
虽然我现在痛得要死
Look, even though I'm in incredible pain

244
00:08:54,112 --> 00:08:56,614
吃了药还非常晕
and quite high on prescription meds,

245
00:08:56,614 --> 00:08:59,751
但没有什么能阻挡我拍完这支广告
nothing is gonna keep me from completing this commercial

246
00:08:59,751 --> 00:09:02,020
为了你们...
for you guys...

247
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,155
我的团队
my crew.

248
00:09:04,155 --> 00:09:05,824
去做事吧
Let's get to work.

249
00:09:05,824 --> 00:09:06,958
我...
W--

250
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,460
我们这么亲近 我们...
We were so close. We were...

251
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,627
我们还要去打球
we were gonna play ball,

252
00:09:09,627 --> 00:09:11,129
他们还要给我取昵称
and you were gonna make up a name for me,

253
00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:13,731
像"范德詹詹" 或者"大回环"
like "Van der jam" Or "Hoopsta."

254
00:09:13,731 --> 00:09:16,167
别担心 我来跟你打球...
Don't worry, man. I'll play ball with ya...

255
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:17,902
等我先抱抱阿班
after I hug Ben.

256
00:09:17,902 --> 00:09:19,871
天哪 他真是激励人 不是吗?
Gosh. He's inspiring, you know?

257
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,940
他看起来身材好好
Plus, he's, like, yoked.

258
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,175
他家里肯定有私人健身房
He must have a home gym.

259
00:09:24,175 --> 00:09:26,678
抱他的时候我得问问
I'm gonna ask him during the hug.

260
00:09:29,614 --> 00:09:31,416
# 你来自七十年代 #
You're from the '70s

261
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,785
# 但我却是九零后贱妞 #
but I'm a '90s bitch

262
00:09:33,785 --> 00:09:34,953
# 我就喜欢 #
I love it

263
00:09:34,953 --> 00:09:36,454
真开心你给我打电话 克洛伊
I'm so glad you called, Chloe.

264
00:09:36,454 --> 00:09:38,456
真开心你的飞机着陆了 德里克
I'm so glad you grounded your plane, Derek.

265
00:09:40,124 --> 00:09:41,759
# 我就喜欢 #
I love it

266
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:43,595
你以前在盥洗室里做过吗?
you ever fool around in a bathroom before?

267
00:09:43,595 --> 00:09:44,762
梅琳达时期试过
Melinda times.

268
00:09:44,762 --> 00:09:45,964
什么?
What?

269
00:09:45,964 --> 00:09:47,165
我参加了梅琳达俱乐部
I'm in the Melinda high club.

270
00:09:47,165 --> 00:09:49,033
在我们开始前 我想让你知道
Before we get started, I just want you to know,

271
00:09:49,033 --> 00:09:51,135
我的梅琳达测试呈阳性
I tested positive for Melinda.

272
00:09:51,135 --> 00:09:52,670
今天是安全期吗?
Are you on birth control?

273
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,072
我不喜欢戴梅琳达
'Cause I don't like to wear a Melinda.

274
00:09:56,074 --> 00:09:57,542
六个男人全毁了
Six guys all ruined,

275
00:09:57,542 --> 00:09:58,843
那些个梅琳达在我脑海里挥之不去
and some bitch named Melinda's in my head,

276
00:09:58,843 --> 00:10:00,845
都是阿班的错
and it's all Ben's fault.

277
00:10:00,845 --> 00:10:02,113
团队怎么会喜欢阿班多过我呢?
How could the crew choose Ben over me?

278
00:10:02,113 --> 00:10:04,449
我对他们友好
I offered them my friendship.

279
00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:05,717
我为朋友两肋插刀
I would kill to be friends with me.

280
00:10:05,717 --> 00:10:07,018
说真的 我...如果有人当我朋友的话
Literally, I--if somebody was friends with me,

281
00:10:07,018 --> 00:10:09,420
我会捅了他们 好做自己的朋友
I would kill them so I could be friends with me.

282
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,390
谁把我的书从中间给撕了?
Who ripped out the middle of my book?

283
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,058
我需要找你聊聊
I needed to talk to you.

284
00:10:14,058 --> 00:10:16,160
我努力勾搭男友圈的其他男人
I tried to hook up with the other guys in my rotation.

285
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,429
但是我不停地听着他们喊"梅琳达"
But I kept hearing them say "Melinda."

286
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:20,431
克洛伊 我之前就是这么说的
Chloe, this is what I was saying before.

287
00:10:20,431 --> 00:10:23,101
在阿班心中不是第一位都要把你整疯了
It bugs you that you're not Ben's number one.

288
00:10:23,101 --> 00:10:24,736
人生中第一次
For the first time in your life,

289
00:10:24,736 --> 00:10:25,837
你开始嫉妒了
you are jealous.

290
00:10:25,837 --> 00:10:27,472
拜托 我才不会嫉妒
Please. I don't get jealous.

291
00:10:27,472 --> 00:10:29,507
向来是我在别人心中播下嫉妒的种子
I make jealous in other people.

292
00:10:29,507 --> 00:10:31,009
我只有让别人嫉妒的份
I make other people jealous.

293
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:33,411
行吧 曾经我也是 但是你看我俩
Yeah, so did I. Now look at us.

294
00:10:33,411 --> 00:10:35,079
我俩也曾辉煌过 现在呢...
We were once golden gods. Now...

295
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:36,915
现在是两只无名小卒
we're number twos.

296
00:10:36,915 --> 00:10:39,017
两只蹲在浴缸里的无名小卒
Two number twos in a tub.

297
00:10:39,017 --> 00:10:41,486
我买了德国的那个碟片
I bought that dvd in Germany.

298
00:10:41,486 --> 00:10:43,421
怪异国度
Weird country.

299
00:10:43,421 --> 00:10:44,923
克洛伊 你苦逼地坐在浴缸里
Chloe, there is a reason

300
00:10:44,923 --> 00:10:46,925
而不是和男友圈五个小哥去玩
why you are sitting here in this tub

301
00:10:46,925 --> 00:10:49,527
是有原因的
instead of out with your five other guys.

302
00:10:49,527 --> 00:10:52,797
班吉b不仅仅是你男友圈的一位炮友
Benjamin is more than just someone in your rotation.

303
00:10:52,797 --> 00:10:55,533
也许他就是呢
Maybe he is.

304
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:57,602
我的意思是 你想成为彼此的独一无二吗?
Well, I mean, do you want to be exclusive with him?

305
00:10:57,602 --> 00:10:59,971
没有其他男人搅局 就和他?
No more rotation, just him?

306
00:10:59,971 --> 00:11:01,105
也许我想
Maybe I do.

307
00:11:01,105 --> 00:11:03,074
那么就和他说去啊
Well, then talk to him.

308
00:11:03,074 --> 00:11:05,777
告诉他你是怎么想的
Tell him how you feel.

309
00:11:10,982 --> 00:11:13,084
卧! 槽!
oh! Ow!

310
00:11:13,084 --> 00:11:14,953
扇你是因为我不愿承认事实
That's just me being uncomfortable with the truth.

311
00:11:14,953 --> 00:11:17,555
谢啦 阿朱
Thank you, June.

312
00:11:18,823 --> 00:11:21,059
那些东西在你头上多久了?
How long have those been in?

313
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:22,427
一个小时了
An hour.

314
00:11:22,427 --> 00:11:23,928
拿下来
Take 'em out.

315
00:11:27,966 --> 00:11:31,069
班吉b・拉夫特吗?
Benjamin Lovett?

316
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:32,904
我们是美国移民局的工作人员
We're with U.S. Immigration services.

317
00:11:32,904 --> 00:11:34,606
检查下你的工作签证
We need to see your work visa.

318
00:11:34,606 --> 00:11:36,474
哦 好的
Uh, yeah.

319
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:39,911
保证一切材料都是合法的
I'm sure you'll find everything's current

320
00:11:39,911 --> 00:11:41,479
而且在有效期内
and up to date.

321
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:43,481
对 肯定是 很好
Yep, sure is. Great.

322
00:11:43,481 --> 00:11:44,983
但是你还是要被遣返
But you're still getting deported.

323
00:11:44,983 --> 00:11:47,819
啥 你和我开玩笑呢?
What is this, some kind of joke?

324
00:11:47,819 --> 00:11:49,821
不 先生 这是上级指示
No, sir. This comes from the very top.

325
00:11:49,821 --> 00:11:51,656
我们必须把您送上前往澳洲的飞机上
We're gonna need you on a plane back to Australia.

326
00:11:51,656 --> 00:11:53,658
啥 喂... 你们不能这么做
Wh--Hey, you can't do this.

327
00:11:53,658 --> 00:11:55,893
为...为啥会这样?
Wh-Why is this happening?

328
00:11:58,496 --> 00:11:59,998
你好
Hello.

329
00:11:59,998 --> 00:12:00,999
搞定了
It's done.

330
00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:03,034
多谢了朱利叶斯 我欠你个大人情
Thanks, Julius. I owe you one.

331
00:12:03,034 --> 00:12:04,702
那么就像事先说好的那样
So can I take you on my brother's houseboat

332
00:12:04,702 --> 00:12:05,937
我能带你去我弟的游艇吗?
like you promised?

333
00:12:05,937 --> 00:12:07,472
那班吉b被遣返这事
Is there any way

334
00:12:07,472 --> 00:12:09,707
有可能被撤销吗?
Benjamin's deportation can be undone?

335
00:12:09,707 --> 00:12:11,142
不行 已经在处理中了
Nope. It's already been processed.

336
00:12:11,142 --> 00:12:12,510
那么 免谈
Then, no.

337
00:12:20,084 --> 00:12:21,452
克洛伊
Chloe.

338
00:12:21,452 --> 00:12:22,754
嘿 你看见刚刚和我在一起的男的吗?
Hey, did you see that guy I was with?

339
00:12:22,754 --> 00:12:24,722
他貌似是个啥保险精算人
He's something called an insurance adjuster.

340
00:12:24,722 --> 00:12:26,157
太性感了
So hot.

341
00:12:26,157 --> 00:12:28,526
我在考虑要不要在男友圈里给他留个位子
I'm thinking about giving him a spot in my rotation.

342
00:12:28,526 --> 00:12:29,661
那阿班怎么办?
What about Ben?

343
00:12:29,661 --> 00:12:31,729
他已经给我们公寓打了无数次电话了
He has called the apartment a thousand times.

344
00:12:31,729 --> 00:12:33,498
你本该告诉他你真实的感觉
You were supposed to tell him how you felt,

345
00:12:33,498 --> 00:12:34,666
而不是将他驱逐出境
not get him deported.

346
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,000
这个吗 我是想过
Well, I thought about it

347
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,169
然后我觉得我就想把他送回国
and I realized I felt like getting him deported.

348
00:12:38,169 --> 00:12:39,504
天哪 你知道吗? 我受够了
Oh, gosh. You know what? I am done.

349
00:12:39,504 --> 00:12:42,140
我再也不会给你任何恋爱建议了
I am not gonna give you any more relationship advice.

350
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,474
随你啊
Okay.

351
00:12:43,474 --> 00:12:44,909
但是我要说最后一件事
But the last thing that I'll say

352
00:12:44,909 --> 00:12:46,444
你把阿班遣送回国
is just because you got Ben deported

353
00:12:46,444 --> 00:12:47,745
并不代表你对他没感觉了
doesn't mean that you'll be over him.

354
00:12:47,745 --> 00:12:51,082
事实上他仍然会在你的脑海里你的心里
He's still going to be in here and in here.

355
00:12:51,082 --> 00:12:53,951
他只该在姐的这里
The only place that a guy should be is here.

356
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:55,386
阿朱 我才不像你呢
June, I'm not like you.

357
00:12:55,386 --> 00:12:56,154
我从不和男人夹缠不清
I don't get twisted up over guys.

358
00:12:56,154 --> 00:12:58,623
我卯足经验然后向前看
I have great experiences and I move on.

359
00:12:58,623 --> 00:13:00,425
我也不和男人夹缠不清
I don't get twisted up over guys either.

360
00:13:00,425 --> 00:13:02,460
我就觉得你不能自私到
I just know you can't do something so selfish

361
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,662
毁掉别人下半生
that it affects someone for the rest of their life.

362
00:13:04,662 --> 00:13:06,597
我曾经也有过这样的机会
I could've done that, too.

363
00:13:06,597 --> 00:13:08,866
艾伦把我甩了之后
After Aaron broke up with me,

364
00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:10,935
我勇往直前的过着自己的生活...
I was moving on with my own life...

365
00:13:10,935 --> 00:13:12,470
当我发现
When I discovered

366
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,405
特瑞沙・费雪 
that Theresa Fisher

367
00:13:14,405 --> 00:13:16,574
抽烟后
was a smoker.

368
00:13:16,574 --> 00:13:18,876
我本可以把举报她 让她退学
I could've busted her and gotten her expelled

369
00:13:18,876 --> 00:13:21,913
这样艾伦又是我一个人的了 可我没那么做
and had Aaron all to myself, but I chose not to,

370
00:13:21,913 --> 00:13:24,615
因为你不能随便毁了别人的人生
because you don't mess with people like that.

371
00:13:24,615 --> 00:13:26,084
要是我当时举报她了呢?
But what if I had made a different choice?

372
00:13:26,084 --> 00:13:28,419
也许艾伦和我还在约会
Maybe Aaron and I would've kept dating.

373
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:31,422
我俩仍然在一起呢 谁知道?
Maybe we'd still be together. Who knows?

374
00:13:31,422 --> 00:13:34,625
这就是为啥你对这男人念念不忘啊
That's why you keep talking about this guy.

375
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:37,462
因为你觉得他是那个离你而去的人
Because you think he's the one that got away.

376
00:13:37,462 --> 00:13:38,796
啥? 不 我不是这么想的
What? No, I don't think that.

377
00:13:38,796 --> 00:13:39,964
现在一切都说得通了
It all makes sense now.

378
00:13:39,964 --> 00:13:41,099
这就是为啥你仍对他耿耿于怀
That's why you're still obsessed

379
00:13:41,099 --> 00:13:43,901
尽管这人早八百年前就把你给甩了
with some guy who dumped you a million years ago.

380
00:13:43,901 --> 00:13:45,470
阿朱 你刚刚和我说那个二逼故事的时候
June, I made out with two girls

381
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,938
我正和这两个姑娘亲热呢
while you were telling me that stupid story.

382
00:13:46,938 --> 00:13:48,906
你需要向前看啊
You need to move on with your life.

383
00:13:48,906 --> 00:13:51,175
你在干嘛啊?
What are you doing?

384
00:13:51,175 --> 00:13:52,143
帮你忙啊
Helping you.

385
00:13:52,143 --> 00:13:53,678
也在帮你们呢
Also helping you.

386
00:13:53,678 --> 00:13:54,912
要是你们想摸我胸就来吧
If you're gonna grab my boob, just grab it.

387
00:13:54,912 --> 00:13:56,414
但是不要调戏我　
But don't tease me.

388
00:13:56,414 --> 00:13:58,382
# 我不在乎 #
I don't care

389
00:13:58,382 --> 00:13:59,851
# 我就喜欢 #
 I love it

390
00:13:59,851 --> 00:14:01,085
# 我不在乎 #
I don't care

391
00:14:01,085 --> 00:14:03,387
真是个好日子啊 不是吗?
it's a great day, isn't it?

392
00:14:03,387 --> 00:14:05,156
阿班被驱逐出境了
Ben's been deported.

393
00:14:05,156 --> 00:14:07,091
工作人员都慌了
The crew is in a panic.

394
00:14:07,091 --> 00:14:10,161
他们现在急需的是一个领袖 一块坚石
What they need right now is a Leader, a rock.

395
00:14:10,161 --> 00:14:11,729
你知道会是谁吗?
And you know who that is?

396
00:14:11,729 --> 00:14:12,930
我吗?
Me?

397
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,665
詹姆斯 我只是开玩笑
I'm just kidding, James.

398
00:14:14,665 --> 00:14:16,467
我知道是你
I know it's you.

399
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:19,637
我只是想把气氛弄轻松一点
I'm just trying to keep it light.

400
00:14:22,473 --> 00:14:24,475
好的 各位 听着
All right. Listen, everyone.

401
00:14:24,475 --> 00:14:27,845
我很遗憾阿班被驱逐出境
Uh, I know it's a shame about Ben being deported,

402
00:14:27,845 --> 00:14:30,515
但是我想让你们知道我仍在这陪着你们
but I just wanna let you guys know that I am still here.

403
00:14:30,515 --> 00:14:32,416
我不会丢下你们的
I'm not going to abandon you.

404
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,886
我经纪人已经和制片公司谈过了
My agent talked to the production company

405
00:14:34,886 --> 00:14:36,854
让他们相信我们已经拍了足够多的镜头
and convinced them that we've already shot enough footage

406
00:14:36,854 --> 00:14:38,156
能制作一支上好的广告片
to cut together a great commercial.

407
00:14:38,156 --> 00:14:40,825
所以乐观说来 大家不用担心
So artistically, you guys don't need to worry.

408
00:14:40,825 --> 00:14:43,094
观众会看见你们的努力
Your work will be seen.

409
00:14:43,094 --> 00:14:45,896
我们应该会再拍一周的
We were supposed to shoot for another week.

410
00:14:45,896 --> 00:14:46,998
还能拿到工资吗?
Will we still get paid?

411
00:14:46,998 --> 00:14:49,133
为什么不呢
I don't see how.

412
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:51,836
不管怎么说 这难道不是很棒吗?
Anyway, isn't this awesome?

413
00:14:51,836 --> 00:14:54,405
这周剩下的日子都放假啦!
I got us the rest of the week off!

414
00:14:54,405 --> 00:14:56,674
谁想要吃寿司看场音乐会?
Who's up for sushi and a matinee?

415
00:14:56,674 --> 00:14:58,910
加州卷哦!
California roll!

416
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,545
# 哦 啦啦啦 #
Ooh, la la la 

417
00:15:00,545 --> 00:15:02,413
我们不能进去 这是男厕所
we can't go in here. This is where men go.

418
00:15:02,413 --> 00:15:04,048
我让我的飞行员小情人德里克
I did not get my pilot lover Derek

419
00:15:04,048 --> 00:15:06,017
在最后一分钟把我们弄上飞往印第安纳的飞机
to get us on a last-Minute flight to indiana

420
00:15:06,017 --> 00:15:07,151
然后来到这龙虾桶男厕所
and come to a lobster barrel bathroom

421
00:15:07,151 --> 00:15:09,020
要是见不到艾伦・德迈亚那我图什么
and not confront Aaron Demayo.

422
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,088
艾伦・德迈亚!
Aaron demayo!

423
00:15:11,088 --> 00:15:13,758
出来!
Get out here!

424
00:15:13,758 --> 00:15:15,126
阿朱
June.

425
00:15:15,126 --> 00:15:18,496
如果这就是他 我懂你的迷恋了 算我一个
If this is him, I get it and I am in.

426
00:15:20,698 --> 00:15:23,401
- 阿朱? - 嗨 艾伦!
- June? -  Hey, Aaron!

427
00:15:23,401 --> 00:15:25,837
你在这儿干吗?
What are you doing here?

428
00:15:25,837 --> 00:15:27,138
阿朱还记得你以前的电话号码
June still has your old phone number memorized.

429
00:15:27,138 --> 00:15:28,873
你妈说你可能在这儿
And your mom said you'd be here.

430
00:15:28,873 --> 00:15:31,142
现在阿朱想和你搞清楚
Now June is gonna screw it out with you

431
00:15:31,142 --> 00:15:32,844
让她明白并不是你离他而去
so she realizes that you're not the one that got away

432
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:34,178
她才能彻底放下
and finally moves on.

433
00:15:34,178 --> 00:15:36,147
不!不 我...我...我不想和你搞
No! No, I...I...I don't want to screw.

434
00:15:36,147 --> 00:15:37,682
我还这儿是因为
I'm here because

435
00:15:37,682 --> 00:15:39,917
我那风室友想证明
my crazy roommate is trying to prove a point.

436
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:42,520
我们的关系"还没结束"
She thinks that you and I have "Unfinished business."

437
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,055
她和别人产生了点麻烦
She's going through a thing with a guy,

438
00:15:44,055 --> 00:15:45,590
所以我努力告诉她
and I'm trying to tell her

439
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,059
她不能对别人无所欲为
that she can't do whatever she wants to people.

440
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:50,661
就像 当我发现特瑞沙・费雪在吸烟
Like, when I busted Theresa Fisher for smoking

441
00:15:50,661 --> 00:15:53,497
我本来可以把她赶出去但是我选择不这么做
and I could've gotten her expelled but I chose not to.

442
00:15:53,497 --> 00:15:56,734
哦我的天 我完全忘了特瑞沙以前吸烟
Oh, my God. I totally forgot that Theresa used to smoke.

443
00:15:56,734 --> 00:15:58,402
小艾出生时
I'm surprised A.J. was

444
00:15:58,402 --> 00:16:00,037
居然还能长全手指和脚趾真令人惊讶
born with all his fingers and toes

445
00:16:00,037 --> 00:16:02,039
等等 谁是小艾?
Wait. Who's A.J.?

446
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,741
哦 抱歉 小艾是我们的儿子
Oh, sorry. A.J.'s our son.

447
00:16:03,741 --> 00:16:06,777
等下 你和特瑞沙结婚了?
Wait. You and Theresa are married?

448
00:16:06,777 --> 00:16:08,880
艾伦 你干吗呢这么慢?
Aaron, what is taking you so long?

449
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,114
小艾一直吵着要去厕所
A.J.'s insisting on going in the men's room,

450
00:16:10,114 --> 00:16:11,782
你却一直不回到桌子旁
but you never came back to the table,

451
00:16:11,782 --> 00:16:14,118
现在我把双胞胎留在苹果电脑和奶酪旁边了
and now I've left the twins alone with their Mac and cheese.

452
00:16:14,118 --> 00:16:17,755
天哪 这也太现实了 我的天
God, this is so real. Heartland.

453
00:16:17,755 --> 00:16:20,925
嗨特瑞沙 嗨我是阿朱 我们是校友
Hey, Theresa. Hi, I'm June. We went to school together.

454
00:16:20,925 --> 00:16:22,927
是的 很高兴见到你 艾伦 你能帮忙带下小艾吗?
Yeah, it's nice to meet you. Aaron, can ya take A.J.?

455
00:16:22,927 --> 00:16:24,662
他一直在闹他快憋死了
he keeps saying he's gonna explode.

456
00:16:24,662 --> 00:16:26,063
我有事忙呢
Kind of in the middle of something here.

457
00:16:26,063 --> 00:16:27,732
哦 好吧
Oh. Okay.

458
00:16:27,732 --> 00:16:29,834
没关系 我来
No, I'll do it. That's fine.

459
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:31,435
不过这月末我会和姐姐一块抽抽烟
But I am going to cabo at the end of the month

460
00:16:31,435 --> 00:16:34,071
我还准备喝点龙舌兰酒
with my sister, and I'm drinking Tequila.

461
00:16:36,707 --> 00:16:39,043
有个小男孩在这里我就不进去了
There's a little boy in there, and that weirds me out.

462
00:16:39,043 --> 00:16:43,681
艾伦 我...我不敢相信你最后和特瑞沙在一起了
Aaron, I...I can't believe you and Theresa ended up together.

463
00:16:43,681 --> 00:16:44,849
他走大运了!
Livin' the dream!

464
00:16:44,849 --> 00:16:46,050
我想这是命运
Guess it was fate.

465
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,920
是啊 要不然就是我了
Yeah. Or it was me.

466
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,055
什么意思?
What do you mean?

467
00:16:51,055 --> 00:16:55,493
如果 我当时把特瑞沙赶出去了
Well, if, you know, I'd gotten Theresa expelled,

468
00:16:55,493 --> 00:16:57,728
事情可能会完全不同
things might've turned out differently.

469
00:16:57,728 --> 00:17:00,731
也许我们会继续约会
You know, maybe you and I would've kept on dating.

470
00:17:00,731 --> 00:17:02,566
也许我们现在还在约会
Maybe we'd still be dating.

471
00:17:02,566 --> 00:17:05,603
谁知道呢? 也许今天是我在那个隔间里
Who knows? Maybe I'd be the one in there in the stall,

472
00:17:05,603 --> 00:17:07,004
帮小艾把尿
helping A.J. Go.

473
00:17:07,004 --> 00:17:09,040
嗨 进来 亲爱的! 别客气!
Hey, get in here, honey! Knock yourself out!

474
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,443
阿朱 你所描绘的这幅画面...
June, this picture that you're painting...

475
00:17:12,443 --> 00:17:14,078
你真的想要吗?
do you really want it?

476
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:15,613
你真的想和这个人还有那个孩子
Do you really wanna live here

477
00:17:15,613 --> 00:17:18,883
还有这些龙虾在这儿?
with this guy and that baby and these lobsters?

478
00:17:18,883 --> 00:17:20,851
我...
W-Well, I...

479
00:17:20,851 --> 00:17:21,986
还是说因为这男人弃你而去
or did you just get hung up on the idea

480
00:17:21,986 --> 00:17:25,056
你就对这个念头耿耿于怀?
because you thought this guy was the one who got away?

481
00:17:26,624 --> 00:17:28,459
你说的对
You're right.

482
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:32,029
我在说什么? 我...我不想这样生活
What am I talking about? I...I don't want this.

483
00:17:32,029 --> 00:17:33,698
我想要这种
I want this.

484
00:17:33,698 --> 00:17:35,433
哦 我懂了
Oh, I knew it.

485
00:17:35,433 --> 00:17:37,134
阿朱 我亲那些女孩
June, I kissed those girls

486
00:17:37,134 --> 00:17:38,970
是为了说明你的故事有多无聊
to illustrate how Boring your story was.

487
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:42,406
- 如果让你误会了 我... - 不! 不是!
- If I misled you in some way, I... - No! No!

488
00:17:42,406 --> 00:17:44,508
我想要以你为代表的...
I want what you represent...

489
00:17:44,508 --> 00:17:47,912
我在纽约的生活 那种我已经拥有的生活
my life in New York, the life that I already have.

490
00:17:47,912 --> 00:17:50,548
看吧? 我说过你迈了一大步 你终于搞明白了
See? I told you. You make a big move and you get clarity.

491
00:17:50,548 --> 00:17:52,049
你只需要把艾伦・德迈亚从你的模式中踢出去
You just had to get Aaron demayo out of your system,

492
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:53,718
就像我对待班吉b
the same way I had to do with Benjamin.

493
00:17:53,718 --> 00:17:55,987
哦 班吉b是刚被我驱逐出境的人
Oh, Benjamin is this guy that I got deported.

494
00:17:55,987 --> 00:17:56,954
说来话长了
It's a really long story,

495
00:17:56,954 --> 00:17:58,589
不过我现在就告诉你
but I'll tell you about it right now.

496
00:17:58,589 --> 00:18:00,758
我们最终在同一座城市里
We were finally going to be in the same city

497
00:18:00,758 --> 00:18:02,059
待了很长一段时间
for a long stretch of time,

498
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:04,061
所以我们决定尽可能在每一个盥洗室里做爱
so we decided to have sex in bathrooms everywhere we could.

499
00:18:04,061 --> 00:18:05,896
在我的公寓里 黛安・索耶的更衣室里
We did it in my apartment, Diane Sawyer's dressing room,

500
00:18:05,896 --> 00:18:07,064
还有房车里....
an R.V...

501
00:18:07,064 --> 00:18:08,599
哦 我的天 我在说什么?
Oh, my God. What am I doing?

502
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:09,767
为什么我会谈起
Why am I talking about

503
00:18:09,767 --> 00:18:10,968
八百年前发生的事?
something that happened a million years ago?

504
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:11,936
是昨天刚发生
That was yesterday.

505
00:18:11,936 --> 00:18:13,971
非常正确! 为什么还没忘掉?
Exactly! Why haven't I moved on?

506
00:18:13,971 --> 00:18:15,439
谁能帮我把这些纸巾全递过来?
Can someone hand me all the paper towels?

507
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:20,077
你还没有开始新的生活因为
You haven't moved on yet because he's still

508
00:18:20,077 --> 00:18:22,179
他依然在你的脑海里你的心里
in there and there,

509
00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:24,015
虽然他不在这儿
even though he's not in there.

510
00:18:24,015 --> 00:18:26,984
我还是忘不了他
I'm not over him.

511
00:18:30,855 --> 00:18:31,922
占用中
Occupied.

512
00:18:31,922 --> 00:18:33,791
我是机长
It's your captain.

513
00:18:37,962 --> 00:18:39,130
嗨 我是...我是德里克
Hey, I'm...I'm Derek.

514
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,699
在克洛伊的男友圈里排第三
Uh, number three in Chloe's rotation.

515
00:18:41,699 --> 00:18:43,534
有你的电话
You have a phone call.

516
00:18:48,005 --> 00:18:50,574
- 喂? - 对不起 很抱歉
- Hello? - Sorry. I'm sorry.

517
00:18:50,574 --> 00:18:52,910
要命克洛伊?! 是你把我驱逐出境的?!
What the hell, Chloe?! you had me deported?!

518
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,845
我一年内都不能再回美国!
I can't come back to the states for a year!

519
00:18:54,845 --> 00:18:56,680
好吧! 你去妈的!
Fine! Screw you!

520
00:19:00,551 --> 00:19:02,086
对不起 我...
Sorry. I'm...

521
00:19:02,086 --> 00:19:04,655
我正在努力向你道歉 好不好? 
this is me trying to apologize. All right?

522
00:19:04,655 --> 00:19:05,990
对不起
I'm sorry.

523
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,058
你为什么这么做?
Why'd you do it?

524
00:19:07,058 --> 00:19:09,660
我...想
I... had to.

525
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,430
你说过梅琳达在你情人里排第一 我有点嫉妒
You said Melinda was your number one, and I got jealous.

526
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,931
你为什么不早说?
Why didn't you say anything?

527
00:19:13,931 --> 00:19:17,735
你可以和我谈谈你的感受而不是毁了我的生活
You could've talked to be about it instead of ruining my life.

528
00:19:17,735 --> 00:19:19,837
因为我不想让你知道
Because I don't want to talk to you about this.

529
00:19:19,837 --> 00:19:22,406
我怕我想要这样生活
I don't want to want this.

530
00:19:22,406 --> 00:19:25,142
我是说 也许等我们老了 一起走在路上
I mean, maybe someday down the road, when we're old...

531
00:19:25,142 --> 00:19:26,510
除非你年轻不老
unless you don't age well.

532
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,579
我预感你的脖子上会长满赘肉
I have a feeling your neck could get gross.

533
00:19:28,579 --> 00:19:30,948
在乎一个人是件好事
You know, it's okay to care about somebody.

534
00:19:30,948 --> 00:19:31,916
我知道 所以打给你
I know, and that's why I'm calling you.

535
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,884
很抱歉把你驱逐出境
I'm sorry that I did this to you.

536
00:19:33,884 --> 00:19:34,852
谢谢你
Thank you.

537
00:19:34,852 --> 00:19:36,520
但是为了自己我不后悔这么做
But I'm not sorry I did this for me.

538
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,456
我还没准备好过这样的生活
I'm not ready for all this.

539
00:19:38,456 --> 00:19:40,458
我明白
I get it.

540
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:43,060
或许某天会的
Maybe someday.

541
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,962
你不会忘了我的 对不?
You're gonna hang up on me now, aren't you?

542
00:19:44,962 --> 00:19:46,497
是的
Yes.

543
00:19:51,735 --> 00:19:53,137
嗨
Hey.

544
00:19:53,137 --> 00:19:55,940
- 怎么样了? - 很好
- How'd it go? - Good.

545
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,875
那么我们干杯
Well, cheers to us.

546
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,777
为我们的生活更进一步
To moving on.

547
00:19:59,777 --> 00:20:01,579
我终于放下了甩了我的人
I finally got over the one who got away,

548
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:03,848
而你...甩了放不下的人
and you... got away.

549
00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:06,884
我跟你说过爱上一个人很傻
I told you it's dumb to get caught up with one guy.

550
00:20:06,884 --> 00:20:08,452
就像得了幽闭症
It's claustrophobic.

551
00:20:08,452 --> 00:20:10,020
就像住在一个巨大的漂亮公寓
It's like living in a big beautiful apartment

552
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,856
却只在厕所里转悠
and only hanging out in the bathroom.

553
00:20:14,091 --> 00:20:15,526
这是干吗?
What's going on?

554
00:20:15,526 --> 00:20:16,861
追忆初中时光
Back in junior high,

555
00:20:16,861 --> 00:20:20,397
我是我最喜欢的伤心情歌
this was my favorite post-breakup empowerment song.

556
00:20:20,397 --> 00:20:22,766
# 生活要悉心聆听 #
Listen as your day unfolds 

557
00:20:22,766 --> 00:20:25,069
# 向未知的明天挑战 #
challenge what the future holds 

558
00:20:25,069 --> 00:20:29,740
＃努力向天空保持昂首姿态　＃
try and keep your head up to the sky

559
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,175
＃ 你必须　＃
you gotta be

560
00:20:31,175 --> 00:20:33,711
＃ 你必须变得厉害 你必须变的勇敢 #
You gotta be bad, you gotta be bold

561
00:20:33,711 --> 00:20:35,479
# 你必须... #
you gotta be...

562
00:20:35,479 --> 00:20:37,548
巨大的进步
Big move.

563
00:20:37,548 --> 00:20:39,617
好吧 谢谢
Yep. Thanks.

564
00:20:53,548 --> 00:20:54,617
{\an5}清醒

565
00:21:00,548 --> 00:21:02,617
{\an5}力量

566
00:21:11,548 --> 00:21:12,617
{\an5}兼容

567
00:21:15,548 --> 00:21:19,617
{\an8}牛蛙太阳眼镜

568
00:21:17,748 --> 00:21:19,617
{\an8}您双眼的盥洗室
