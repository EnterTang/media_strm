1
00:00:02,892 --> 00:00:04,949
What do you mean
"Lana hasn't called"?

2
00:00:05,079 --> 00:00:08,119
I mean, I've been sitting
here for like five million years,

3
00:00:08,121 --> 00:00:10,661
and the phone hasn't rung once,
and so every time it doesn't,

4
00:00:10,663 --> 00:00:13,398
I just assume it's not her,
not calling to say they...

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,964
They should've rescued Sterling
and Rip from the pirates hours ago!

6
00:00:16,966 --> 00:00:19,730
- Maybe they did and
just didn't call... - No,

7
00:00:19,732 --> 00:00:23,635
I gave them explicit orders to
What the hell are you wearing?

8
00:00:23,637 --> 00:00:24,904
Uh, this
thing cal cd my boss made

9
00:00:24,906 --> 00:00:26,840
me sleep at my desk, so pajamas?

10
00:00:26,842 --> 00:00:28,575
Men's pajamas?

11
00:00:28,577 --> 00:00:32,443
For God's sake woman,
where is your pride?

12
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:33,611
In my work.

13
00:00:33,613 --> 00:00:36,512
That may be the funniest
thing you've ever said.

14
00:00:36,514 --> 00:00:37,212
Thank you.

15
00:00:37,214 --> 00:00:38,513
Oh shut up.

16
00:00:38,515 --> 00:00:43,021
And then try Lana's sat-phone!
Wait, what if Lana's been captured, too?

17
00:00:43,023 --> 00:00:47,626
Then I'll have to ransom her and
Sterling and Rip and, well no,

18
00:00:47,628 --> 00:00:49,194
Miss Gillette's on her own.

19
00:00:49,196 --> 00:00:51,531
Still, get Cyril in here!

20
00:00:51,533 --> 00:00:54,033
I need him to find a way
to pay for all this!

21
00:00:54,035 --> 00:00:58,371
Wait a minute, that can't be right...
I remember being really

22
00:00:58,373 --> 00:01:04,478
mad and really drunk and deciding to
do some online Banking! Oh my God,

23
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,050
I must have embezz, arrassed
myself last night, huh?

24
00:01:08,052 --> 00:01:11,019
Don't talk like black
people, and how should I know?

25
00:01:11,021 --> 00:01:12,588
I'm still ripped.

26
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,259
So, you don't, um,
happen to remember me saying

27
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:20,163
anything about passwords to
say, Swiss bank accounts?

28
00:01:20,165 --> 00:01:23,666
I don't even remember
who peed on your sofa.

29
00:01:23,668 --> 00:01:26,301
- Although, if I was a gamblin' man...
- Cyril!

30
00:01:26,303 --> 00:01:26,868
What!

31
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,204
Ugh, smells
like a kennel in here.

32
00:01:29,206 --> 00:01:31,405
Cash reserves, how
much do we have?

33
00:01:31,407 --> 00:01:35,608
- I'll, uh, need to run those
numbers - Well hurry up,

34
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,776
we don't have a minute to lose!

35
00:01:36,778 --> 00:01:41,680
God only knows what kind of
torture Sterling's going through.

36
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:04,572
Get off the bucket.

37
00:02:04,574 --> 00:02:05,641
I'm not done.

38
00:02:05,643 --> 00:02:06,709
Yes, you are.

39
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:10,212
But I didn't, you know, I
can't with all the everybody

40
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:12,748
looking at me, and
then the judgements.

41
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,249
Noah?

42
00:02:15,587 --> 00:02:18,321
by Malaysian pirates trying to
rescue a person who is now

43
00:02:18,323 --> 00:02:21,357
responsible for my
getting crabs twice?

44
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:25,161
Oh come on, These crabs,
this time, were not my fault.

45
00:02:25,163 --> 00:02:29,465
- This whole dungeon is, um...
- Were you gonna say "lousy with them"?

46
00:02:29,467 --> 00:02:34,503
- I was, but then I realized that's...
- Where that phrase comes from, yeah.

47
00:02:34,505 --> 00:02:35,404
Yeah.

48
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:35,938
Yeah.

49
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,338
Yeah.

50
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,707
So Guess what I'm in.

51
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:40,041
No mood?

52
00:02:40,043 --> 00:02:42,577
Winner winner, chicken dinner.

53
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,746
Wait, shouldn't it
be some kinda crab dish?

54
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,448
Because of the crabs?

55
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,518
Like crabcakes?

56
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,786
Ooh, or Lana.

57
00:02:49,788 --> 00:02:51,454
Lana.

58
00:02:51,456 --> 00:02:54,124
Lana.

59
00:02:54,126 --> 00:02:55,259
Lanaaahhhhh!

60
00:02:55,261 --> 00:02:55,660
What?

61
00:02:55,662 --> 00:02:58,997
Dugenon us crabs.

62
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:02,635
Cause we're in a dungeon.

63
00:03:02,637 --> 00:03:04,603
I'm kidding, crab rangoon.

64

65
00:03:40,418 --> 00:03:43,486
Noah, seriously, I swear to God...
Stop.

66
00:03:44,488 --> 00:03:47,122
Rock beats spoon, you should know
that, you're an archaeologist.

67
00:03:47,124 --> 00:03:48,590
Ann!

68
00:03:48,592 --> 00:03:49,658
Thropologist!

69
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,494
I mean if you're doing it just
to get on my nerves, okay I get it,

70
00:03:52,496 --> 00:03:56,966
- but if you're trying to actually escape...
- Well at least he's trying something.

71
00:03:56,968 --> 00:03:59,701
- As opposed to the doublemint twins...
- Meh!

72
00:03:59,703 --> 00:04:01,570
And it's one, two,
three, go Herd!

73
00:04:01,572 --> 00:04:04,973
- Missed it by
that much - Shut up.

74
00:04:04,975 --> 00:04:08,210
It's no use. That trap door goes
up a vertical shaft to the radio room...

75
00:04:08,212 --> 00:04:11,680
- Exactly, and if we get to the radio...
- Which this idiot shot to piece...

76
00:04:11,682 --> 00:04:13,682
Holy shit.

77
00:04:13,684 --> 00:04:14,049
Wh-?

78
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:15,650
What the hell happened to him?!

79
00:04:15,652 --> 00:04:16,518
- He...
- Who knows?!

80
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,086
Maybe a brain aneurysm!

81
00:04:18,088 --> 00:04:20,521
No, he...
It's the silent killer!

82
00:04:20,523 --> 00:04:20,988
Noah!

83
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,323
Not unlike a metal spoon.

84
00:04:22,325 --> 00:04:25,859
Sharpened to a razor's edge and
used to slit an anthropologist's

85
00:04:25,861 --> 00:04:27,260
birdlike throat.

86
00:04:27,262 --> 00:04:32,832
- He just kinda keeled over...
- Probably thanks to your bucket-stankch.

87
00:04:32,834 --> 00:04:33,299
- Wh-?

88
00:04:33,301 --> 00:04:34,300
I didn't even go!

89
00:04:34,302 --> 00:04:36,903
We're going, one,
two, three, down Herd!

90
00:04:36,905 --> 00:04:37,370
Oof!

91
00:04:37,372 --> 00:04:38,637
Jeez, how bout a little warning?!

92
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,405
I said "Down Herd."

93
00:04:39,407 --> 00:04:42,074
Couple things, one, Ray,
thanks for perpetuating the

94
00:04:42,076 --> 00:04:45,043
stereotype of the gay man as
collegiate cheerleader...

95
00:04:45,045 --> 00:04:48,814
For your information,
almost all male cheerleaders are...

96
00:04:48,816 --> 00:04:52,551
- Finely-tuned heteroathletes,
yeah, hang on, I'm getting a call.

97
00:04:52,553 --> 00:04:53,553
Brrnng, hello?

98
00:04:53,555 --> 00:04:55,755
Hi, it's lacrosse, you lose.

99
00:04:55,757 --> 00:04:57,157
Lacrosse?!

100
00:04:57,159 --> 00:05:00,394
Yeah, it's
Algonquin for bloodsport?

101
00:05:00,396 --> 00:05:02,129
That's not
Algonquin for anything.

102
00:05:02,131 --> 00:05:02,797
Noah?

103
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:03,331
- My sat-phone!

104
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,901
Yeah, Noah,
her, wait, your what?

105
00:05:05,903 --> 00:05:06,869
- My sat-phone!

106
00:05:06,871 --> 00:05:08,070
The pirates took it!

107
00:05:08,072 --> 00:05:12,340
And since I haven't called in, ISIS
should be calling me any time now!

108
00:05:12,342 --> 00:05:16,545
Jeezow Lana,
answer your stupid phone.

109
00:05:16,547 --> 00:05:17,079
Hello?!

110
00:05:17,081 --> 00:05:18,481
Gimme Sterleen Archer mudda!

111
00:05:18,483 --> 00:05:21,251
Oh my God be more Chinesey.

112
00:05:21,253 --> 00:05:22,652
Pirates, line two!

113
00:05:22,654 --> 00:05:23,053
- Wh-?

114
00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:23,754
Well for -- put them through!

115
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:26,356
Oh my God be more I hate you.

116
00:05:26,358 --> 00:05:28,525
That's why your
phone is blinking!

117
00:05:28,527 --> 00:05:29,993
Oh. Hello?

118
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:33,697
- This is Malory Archer...
- This is Malory Archer...

119
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:35,866
Okay, den you lissen to me!

120
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:38,269
No, you just
listen to me, buster!

121
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:38,702
Bucky!

122
00:05:38,704 --> 00:05:40,705
If you touch one
hair on my son's head,

123
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,640
I'll have your guts for garters!

124
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:45,510
You like wear garter?

125
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:45,978
- Wh-?

126
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,745
It's an idiom!

127
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:47,846
You heathen!

128
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:51,450
Malory will call, she'll haggle
over the ransom for me, you and Riley.

129
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:52,851
What about me?

130
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:53,552
And me?

131
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:56,021
- We'll come back for you
later - No, shut up,

132
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,557
we gotta get that phone, or
something, I don't know,

133
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:00,993
but I don't want Mother
talking to Bucky!

134
00:06:00,995 --> 00:06:01,460
Why not?

135
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:04,363
She's been coming to your rescue
since you were in short pants!

136
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:07,299
Rr. Rr. Rrr!

137
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:10,302
Oh for, Sterling get your things.
We're leaving.

138
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:13,705
Before this quack's office
burns to the ground.

139
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:17,175
Rr. Rr. Rrr!

140
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:18,710
Sterling get your things.

141
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:19,812
We're leaving.

142
00:06:19,814 --> 00:06:23,181
Before this cruddy school
burns to the ground.

143
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:26,252
Rr. Rr. Rrr!

144
00:06:26,254 --> 00:06:28,220
Sterling get your things!

145
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:29,622
He's gay.

146
00:06:29,624 --> 00:06:30,556
You were in the army?

147
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:31,991
Oh, who remembers.

148
00:06:31,993 --> 00:06:33,126
Well, try!

149
00:06:33,128 --> 00:06:34,061
I can't!

150
00:06:34,063 --> 00:06:35,362
Remember!

151
00:06:35,364 --> 00:06:37,932
There's a reason they call
it "black-out drunk!"

152
00:06:37,934 --> 00:06:41,336
If I don't remember that password
I can't unembezzle that money,

153
00:06:41,338 --> 00:06:45,540
and then I'm screwed because I don't
have - Ten million dollars?

154
00:06:45,542 --> 00:06:49,377
That's outrageous, I won't pay
it, I don't even want the gay back.

155
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:51,580
So you better just
sharpen your pencil.

156
00:06:51,582 --> 00:06:53,948
- I don't have penc...
- It's an idiom!

157
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:57,552
Aw, but I love it when Malory bails
you out of one of your idiot jams.

158
00:06:57,554 --> 00:06:58,253
Oh really.

159
00:06:58,255 --> 00:07:00,855
Yeah, 'cause then I get to
watch her rub it in your face.

160
00:07:00,857 --> 00:07:03,992
- Oh my God, okay first of all --
- First of all!

161
00:07:03,994 --> 00:07:04,593
- Wh-?!

162
00:07:04,595 --> 00:07:05,394
Riley no!

163
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:05,827
Don't say it!

164
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:07,062
He's been here voluntarily!

165
00:07:07,064 --> 00:07:10,599
Partying his ass off,
as king of the pirates!

166
00:07:10,601 --> 00:07:12,167
What?

167
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:14,670
Don't listen to him,
I bet that brain aneurysm

168
00:07:14,672 --> 00:07:16,638
scrambled les Broca's area.

169
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:23,111
Language center of the brain?

170
00:07:23,113 --> 00:07:24,813
Noah.

171
00:07:24,815 --> 00:07:25,780
Thank you.

172
00:07:25,782 --> 00:07:27,081
No problem.

173
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,483
Actually not making
much progress.

174
00:07:29,485 --> 00:07:32,019
You're kidding.

175
00:07:32,021 --> 00:07:33,854
No.

176
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:39,406
Three million,
and not a penny more.

177
00:07:39,408 --> 00:07:43,643
And before you see one thin dime,
I want to talk to Sterling!

178
00:07:43,645 --> 00:07:44,177
Cyril!

179
00:07:44,179 --> 00:07:44,844
Waagh!

180
00:07:44,846 --> 00:07:47,647
- Hey, Ms. Archer...
- Three million in cash?

181
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:50,016
That, uh, should
not be a problem.

182
00:07:50,018 --> 00:07:51,651
I know it shouldn't be.

183
00:07:51,653 --> 00:07:53,519
And it better not be.

184
00:07:53,521 --> 00:07:57,023
Why would it be, it's not, I just
need to move a little money around.

185
00:07:57,025 --> 00:07:57,957
So move it.

186
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,726
Today please!

187
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:02,228
Keep looking,
maybe I wrote it down!

188
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,697
Archersucks, no.

189
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:07,300
Killarcherdie, no.

190
00:08:07,302 --> 00:08:10,103
- Uh - Just trying
all my usual passwords.

191
00:08:10,105 --> 00:08:12,473
Hey, way to not
give him the power.

192
00:08:12,475 --> 00:08:13,841
Thank you.

193
00:08:13,843 --> 00:08:14,842
Do you hear me?

194
00:08:14,844 --> 00:08:18,580
I want proof of life!

195
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:19,614
Duh.

196
00:08:19,616 --> 00:08:22,751
- You lying pathetic little piece of --
- Hooof!

197
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:24,819
Lana no!
C'mon, you're gonna kill him!

198
00:08:24,821 --> 00:08:26,555
Yeah, that's the plan!

199
00:08:26,557 --> 00:08:27,122
Hey!

200
00:08:27,124 --> 00:08:27,722
Knock it off!

201
00:08:27,724 --> 00:08:31,392
Look, Lana, don't get me wrong, I
like your spunk -- - Phrasing.

202
00:08:31,394 --> 00:08:34,929
Shut up, but I promised his
mother I'd bring him home safely,

203
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,365
and I just assume that
includes his spleen.

204
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:40,369
- Think that ship might've sailed...
- No, not a ship --

205
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:41,403
- That was an idiom.

206
00:08:41,405 --> 00:08:42,170
A helicopter.

207
00:08:42,172 --> 00:08:45,774
There's an old Huey down by the dock,
and it just so happens Rip Riley

208
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:47,042
here can fly it.

209
00:08:47,044 --> 00:08:48,076
No shit.

210
00:08:48,078 --> 00:08:50,645
Yeah Rip Riley
here can fly anything.

211
00:08:50,647 --> 00:08:52,681
You know, as long
as it's got fuel.

212
00:08:52,683 --> 00:08:56,685
Well, Rip, why don't we just look
around for some fuel in this cell...

213
00:08:56,687 --> 00:08:58,721
- Doubt they'd keep it in here.
- In which!

214
00:08:58,723 --> 00:09:00,523
We're still locked!

215
00:09:00,525 --> 00:09:02,825
I figured we'd
kinda work backwards.

216
00:09:02,827 --> 00:09:06,596
From the stealing
of the helicopter.

217
00:09:06,598 --> 00:09:08,298
Archerstabface, no.

218
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,767
Archerbortion --
- No!

219
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:13,536
What're you, gonna type random words
in there the rest of your life?

220
00:09:13,538 --> 00:09:14,937
All five minutes of it!

221
00:09:14,939 --> 00:09:16,806
At which point Ms.
Archer will probably walk in here and

222
00:09:16,808 --> 00:09:19,542
dissolve me in a drum of acid,
unless you have a better idea.

223
00:09:19,544 --> 00:09:23,079
- State-dependent memory!

224
00:09:23,081 --> 00:09:26,348
- So, your plan is for us to
get as black-out, knee-walking,

225
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:30,519
shitfaced drunk as we were last night,
in the hopes that we remember

226
00:09:30,521 --> 00:09:32,454
the password.

227
00:09:32,456 --> 00:09:38,727
Well don't hog it all!
Pam!

228
00:09:38,729 --> 00:09:41,863
Ugh, seriously, I bet that
would've killed a lesser man.

229
00:09:41,865 --> 00:09:44,432
There's a lesser man than you?

230
00:09:44,434 --> 00:09:45,934
Uh yeah, his name's Houdini?

231
00:09:45,936 --> 00:09:48,370
- Whom I wish you were --
- Yeah, cause then I

232
00:09:48,372 --> 00:09:50,872
- could just puke up a key...
- Because you'd be dead.

233
00:09:50,874 --> 00:09:52,173
Houdini's dead?

234
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,141
You know what?

235
00:09:53,143 --> 00:09:53,774
Yes.

236
00:09:53,776 --> 00:09:56,944
Here's what we do, we lure Bucky
down here, and take him hostage.

237
00:09:56,946 --> 00:09:57,611
And then?

238
00:09:57,613 --> 00:09:58,546
Then we'll see.

239
00:09:58,548 --> 00:09:59,313
We'll keep it loose.

240
00:09:59,315 --> 00:10:03,149
Oh for, and just how the hell are
we supposed to lure him down here?!

241
00:10:03,151 --> 00:10:04,350
Sterling Archer?

242
00:10:04,352 --> 00:10:05,251
What's that?

243
00:10:05,253 --> 00:10:08,054
Sorry, I couldn't hear you over
the sound of my plan working.

244
00:10:08,056 --> 00:10:09,121
Telephone!

245
00:10:09,123 --> 00:10:09,922
It's you mudda!

246
00:10:09,924 --> 00:10:13,926
- My -- Wait, please tell me you didn't
tell her I was temporarily the pirapi-king.

247
00:10:13,928 --> 00:10:17,396
No not yet, but this
is damn good I... Nnngh!

248
00:10:17,398 --> 00:10:17,930
Sterling?!

249
00:10:17,932 --> 00:10:18,865
Sterling are you alright?!

250
00:10:18,867 --> 00:10:21,133
No Mother, I'm
a captive of pirates!

251
00:10:21,135 --> 00:10:26,171
Oh, and Riley said he no longer finds
you attractive 'cause you're too old!

252
00:10:26,173 --> 00:10:27,239
He what?!

253
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:27,873
What?!

254
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,308
You little...
Sunamabeetch!

255
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,275
Grrk!

256
00:10:30,277 --> 00:10:31,910
Was that a gunshot?!

257
00:10:31,912 --> 00:10:34,879
- Yep, they got ol' Ray this time...
- Raayyy!

258
00:10:34,881 --> 00:10:36,647
And now I keel you!

259
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:37,748
Rrrgh!

260
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,583
Right in my same ear!

261
00:10:39,585 --> 00:10:40,250
Ha!

262
00:10:40,252 --> 00:10:41,919
Good, serves you right!

263
00:10:41,921 --> 00:10:44,621
- Malory, I never said...
- You're no spring

264
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:46,456
chicken yourself, you know!

265
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,092
Rrrnh!

266
00:10:49,094 --> 00:10:49,993
Lanaahh!

267
00:10:49,995 --> 00:10:51,094
Is Lana hit?!

268
00:10:51,096 --> 00:10:52,061
Someone talk to me!

269
00:10:52,063 --> 00:10:55,366
Mother, I'm a
little busy right now.

270
00:10:55,368 --> 00:10:55,699
Noah!

271
00:10:55,701 --> 00:10:56,133
What?!

272
00:10:56,135 --> 00:10:56,667
Spoon him!

273
00:10:56,669 --> 00:11:01,572
You mean spoon
him as in like oh!

274
00:11:01,574 --> 00:11:06,378
Today please!

275
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,716
I am incredibly sorry.

276
00:11:10,718 --> 00:11:14,085
Grrk!

277
00:11:14,087 --> 00:11:14,719
Rip?!

278
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:18,156
Rip I take it all back, you're as
strong and sexy as the night we -

279
00:11:18,158 --> 00:11:19,491
- For shit's sake, Mother!

280
00:11:19,493 --> 00:11:22,027
How short is the list of guys
you haven't screwed?!

281
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:24,695
Oh, how dare you?

282
00:11:24,697 --> 00:11:26,997
You can forget
about that ransom!

283
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:28,599
For once you're on your own!

284
00:11:28,601 --> 00:11:33,637
- For once? Oh my God, Columbia Hou --
All I wanted!

285
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:34,939
Was to mourn!

286
00:11:34,941 --> 00:11:39,578
The murder of my crazy-hot Russian
fiancée by becoming a pirate king!

287
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,514
But I guess that was
too much to ask!

288
00:11:42,516 --> 00:11:47,954
So Mother can keep her stupid
ransom, because I don't need her!

289
00:11:47,956 --> 00:11:55,428
What I do need, is some
frickin crab shampoo!

290
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:55,995
Noah!

291
00:11:55,997 --> 00:11:56,329
Wounded!

292
00:11:56,331 --> 00:12:00,399
- No, I'm -- well, maybe some psychic
scarring, but physically I'm --

293
00:12:00,401 --> 00:12:00,966
- Tend!

294
00:12:00,968 --> 00:12:01,901
To the wounded!

295
00:12:01,903 --> 00:12:02,935
Oh, right.

296
00:12:02,937 --> 00:12:04,403
Not him!

297
00:12:04,405 --> 00:12:05,537
Start with Lana!

298
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:06,171
I'm fine!

299
00:12:06,173 --> 00:12:07,005
Check on Ray!

300
00:12:07,007 --> 00:12:08,240
Yeah, he is not looking good.

301
00:12:08,242 --> 00:12:13,244
Although, neither is Riley
and neither is your situation!

302
00:12:13,246 --> 00:12:15,146
Because you can forget ransom!

303
00:12:15,148 --> 00:12:18,216
Now you and your
friends will die here!

304
00:12:18,218 --> 00:12:19,918
Yeah, speaking of
forgetting, couple things.

305
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,487
One, these aren't my friends.

306
00:12:21,489 --> 00:12:25,525
- Got that right - I
mean her, yes, kinda, maybe,

307
00:12:25,527 --> 00:12:27,993
- but there's a lotta weird sexual tension...
- Ha!

308
00:12:27,995 --> 00:12:31,331
But these other three, whatever,
who cares, I mean Noah's a slave.

309
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,501
- Yeah, about that--
- Noah not now!

310
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,370
And two - Aha, but
I shoot gun many times!

311
00:12:37,372 --> 00:12:41,007
And in all the excitement
I lose track myself!

312
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:45,478
So now you thinking, did he fire
eight shots or only - Four.

313
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,981
Idiot. So get your
things, we're leaving.

314
00:12:47,983 --> 00:12:51,619
Hey, can I run up to my hovel
and grab the only extant copy of my

315
00:12:51,621 --> 00:12:52,520
dissertation?

316
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:52,954
Noah?

317
00:12:52,956 --> 00:12:53,855
Still got four bullets.

318
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,990
Do you know what
"extant" means?

319
00:12:55,992 --> 00:12:58,126
You know what
"license to kill" means?

320
00:12:58,128 --> 00:13:00,273
I'll just um write another one.

321
00:13:00,393 --> 00:13:03,632
The world holds its breath.

322
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:07,436
Ray?!

323
00:13:07,556 --> 00:13:09,606
Ray, c'mon honey, stay with me!

324
00:13:09,807 --> 00:13:13,009
Ray. Ray! Ray!!

325
00:13:13,011 --> 00:13:15,612
- Not sure that's helping!
- Yeah neither are you!

326
00:13:15,614 --> 00:13:17,747
Lana, I only have two hands.

327
00:13:17,749 --> 00:13:19,650
What I don't have, is all day!

328
00:13:19,652 --> 00:13:20,818
There, I finished!

329
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,485
Jeez damn!

330
00:13:21,487 --> 00:13:22,687
How ya doin, Riley?

331
00:13:22,689 --> 00:13:25,423
How the hell do
you think I'm doing?!

332
00:13:25,425 --> 00:13:27,425
Hey relax, Nick Furious!

333
00:13:27,427 --> 00:13:29,861
Save your strength for
flying the chopper.

334
00:13:29,863 --> 00:13:32,998
And again, I am
just incredibly sorry.

335
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,199
What's your blood type?

336
00:13:34,201 --> 00:13:35,567
How would I know?

337
00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:36,068
- Wh-?

338
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:36,969
How would you not?!

339
00:13:36,971 --> 00:13:38,837
Who am I, Karl Landsteiner?

340
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:40,705
Discoverer of blood groups?

341
00:13:40,707 --> 00:13:44,509
You don't know your own blood
type, but you know who discovered them.

342
00:13:44,511 --> 00:13:48,380
Yeah, now Your
exact words, Pam!

343
00:13:48,382 --> 00:13:52,083
"Dr. Charles Drew, or I
will eat a bag of dicks!"

344
00:13:52,085 --> 00:13:54,219
Bring 'em.

345
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:58,123
And not to diminish the
accomplishments of Dr. Charles Drew, but...

346
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,157
God damn it Archer!

347
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:01,659
Ray needs O positive blood,
or he is gonna die!

348
00:14:01,661 --> 00:14:03,061
So give him some of yours!

349
00:14:03,063 --> 00:14:04,796
- I'm A-negative!

350
00:14:04,798 --> 00:14:05,630
Hey, me too!

351
00:14:05,632 --> 00:14:10,100
- And even if Riley's O-positive...
- No, I'm A-negative too.

352
00:14:10,102 --> 00:14:12,468
He's already a quart low.

353
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,870
- Sooo...
- Oh.

354
00:14:14,872 --> 00:14:16,271
Positive?

355
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:17,406
Yeah.

356
00:14:17,408 --> 00:14:21,609
One of these days, I swear to
God, I am going to burn this place

357
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,212
straight down to the ground.

358
00:14:23,214 --> 00:14:26,315
Oh my God yes,
hey, what about this Sunday?!

359
00:14:26,317 --> 00:14:29,585
Unless you want people in here,
in which case weeohh my God!

360
00:14:29,587 --> 00:14:32,655
Waagh!

361
00:14:32,657 --> 00:14:34,891
Five oh, five oh!

362
00:14:34,893 --> 00:14:35,525
Cyril!

363
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:37,527
Never mind moving that money.

364
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:38,795
What money, oh!

365
00:14:38,797 --> 00:14:40,130
Really? You sure?

366
00:14:40,132 --> 00:14:43,266
- Because all I need to do is just...
- Re-evaluate your entire

367
00:14:43,268 --> 00:14:45,435
life, and yes, I'm sure.

368
00:14:45,437 --> 00:14:49,539
Sterling can get himself
out of this jam. For once.

369
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:53,776
Oh and don't
be here on Sunday. Pam.

370
00:14:53,778 --> 00:14:57,047
Why just me, what's
happenin' Sunday?

371
00:14:57,049 --> 00:15:00,249
Probably my grisly murder, since
we still haven't found that password!

372
00:15:00,251 --> 00:15:02,385
Ya try "guest"?

373
00:15:02,387 --> 00:15:07,056
- No Pam, I didn't, because I'm not an --
- Oh, eat a dick.

374
00:15:07,058 --> 00:15:09,859
Bring it.

375
00:15:09,861 --> 00:15:11,427
How much of my
blood does he need?!

376
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:12,895
I dunno, ten gills.

377
00:15:12,897 --> 00:15:13,463
- Wh-?!

378
00:15:13,465 --> 00:15:14,297
U.S. or imperial?!

379
00:15:14,299 --> 00:15:17,066
- Just keep sqinueezing
that gag-ball.

380
00:15:17,068 --> 00:15:18,567
That I don't wanna
know why you have.

381
00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:19,135
No, you do not.

382
00:15:19,137 --> 00:15:21,504
You will never
make it to helicopter!

383
00:15:21,506 --> 00:15:23,439
My men will cut you
down like dogs!

384
00:15:23,441 --> 00:15:25,308
Thanks, human shield.

385
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,010
Although Where the
hell are all your men?

386
00:15:27,012 --> 00:15:28,045
Wh-? Are you serious?

387
00:15:28,047 --> 00:15:30,180
They're all at the
intramural lacrosse finals.

388
00:15:30,182 --> 00:15:31,082
The what?!

389
00:15:31,084 --> 00:15:31,616
Oww!

390
00:15:31,618 --> 00:15:33,017
Lana shut up. That's today?!

391
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:34,051
It's right now.

392
00:15:34,053 --> 00:15:35,152
Well, in ten minutes.

393
00:15:35,154 --> 00:15:36,387
- Who's playing?!
- Archer.

394
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:40,224
- Uh, the Lax-mi Singhers...
- They made the finals?!

395
00:15:40,226 --> 00:15:42,760
Versus the
Archers of Loafcrosse.

396
00:15:42,762 --> 00:15:43,428
- Wh-?!

397
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,462
That's my team!

398
00:15:44,464 --> 00:15:44,896
Archer.

399
00:15:44,898 --> 00:15:46,230
Lana, I'm team captain!

400
00:15:46,232 --> 00:15:48,899
I built that team from nothing, and now --
- Archer!

401
00:15:48,901 --> 00:15:49,866
Ray is dying.

402
00:15:49,868 --> 00:15:52,135
Does that mean
so must my dream?!

403
00:15:52,137 --> 00:15:55,638
Look, I think it's great that
for once you're getting out of a jam

404
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,474
without your mother's help, but --
- Not for once!

405
00:15:58,476 --> 00:16:00,376
Hello? Columbia House?

406
00:16:00,378 --> 00:16:03,679
But remember earlier, when you
said that you and I were friends?

407
00:16:03,681 --> 00:16:04,747
I, of course.

408
00:16:04,749 --> 00:16:08,584
I mean I know we fight a lot, but
God, now that I think about it,

409
00:16:08,586 --> 00:16:10,420
you're my only friend.

410
00:16:10,422 --> 00:16:12,222
Wow.

411
00:16:12,224 --> 00:16:13,490
Right?

412
00:16:13,492 --> 00:16:16,860
- Yes, Archer, because if you do this...
- Please don't make me choose.

413
00:16:16,862 --> 00:16:28,871
I will never, ever forgive you, and
we will never, ever be friends again.

414
00:16:28,873 --> 00:16:30,473
Woooo!

415
00:16:30,475 --> 00:16:32,774
Birds-eye view of lacrosse!

416
00:16:32,776 --> 00:16:35,477
Lana, Lana, we
got the face-off!

417
00:16:35,479 --> 00:16:38,647
- Hooray!
- Now can we please get out of here?!

418
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:41,282
Because we are
totally vulnerable!

419
00:16:41,284 --> 00:16:43,318
I know, look at our defenders!

420
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,954
He's not talking
about the defenders.

421
00:16:45,956 --> 00:16:47,489
The crease, idiots!

422
00:16:47,491 --> 00:16:48,724
Guard the crease!

423
00:16:48,726 --> 00:16:50,492
And what are my middies doing?

424
00:16:50,494 --> 00:16:51,227
Middies!

425
00:16:51,229 --> 00:16:53,095
C'mon, get in position!

426
00:16:53,097 --> 00:16:54,597
Oh shit, they are!

427
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:59,670
- No look, they're
all bunched -- oh.

428
00:16:59,672 --> 00:17:01,039
Iiiiincomiiiiiing!

429
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,540
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

430
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:04,775
- Hooray!
- Wait wait wait, Lana --

431
00:17:04,777 --> 00:17:06,444
Get some! Get some!

432
00:17:06,446 --> 00:17:10,014
You sons of bitches!

433
00:17:10,016 --> 00:17:10,815
Suck it!

434
00:17:10,817 --> 00:17:12,683
Nooooooo!

435
00:17:12,685 --> 00:17:13,584
Hang on!

436
00:17:13,586 --> 00:17:16,220
Lanaaaaa!

437
00:17:16,222 --> 00:17:17,355
Archerrrrr!

438
00:17:17,357 --> 00:17:18,589
What, Lana!

439
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:21,425
I Nothing, I got you.

440
00:17:21,427 --> 00:17:22,526
You got me!

441
00:17:22,528 --> 00:17:23,761
Well that's just super!

442
00:17:23,763 --> 00:17:25,563
What the hell is your problem?!

443
00:17:25,565 --> 00:17:26,697
My problem!

444
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:29,800
Is you just Bonnie and
Clyded my starting middies!

445
00:17:29,802 --> 00:17:30,601
- Wh-?

446
00:17:30,603 --> 00:17:33,103
- They were Red-shirt freshmen, Lana!
Who I was grooming!

447
00:17:33,105 --> 00:17:36,073
But now I guess the Archers of
Loafcrosse can forget about the

448
00:17:36,075 --> 00:17:38,476
South Pacific lacrosse
championships!

449
00:17:38,478 --> 00:17:39,644
Yeah that's not a thing.

450
00:17:39,646 --> 00:17:41,512
If and when
that becomes a thing!

451
00:17:41,514 --> 00:17:42,513
Here's a thing.

452
00:17:42,515 --> 00:17:46,650
Your mother doesn't know you ran
away to be a pirate, so... - No!

453
00:17:46,652 --> 00:17:48,752
- Lana, seriously, she...
- Would literally kill you.

454
00:17:48,754 --> 00:17:51,387
Well, figurative
yeah, literally.

455
00:17:51,389 --> 00:17:55,291
So now, for the rest of your
idiot life, I'm got that on you.

456
00:17:55,293 --> 00:17:56,559
Wow.

457
00:17:56,561 --> 00:17:57,326
Right?

458
00:17:57,328 --> 00:17:59,394
Oh my God!

459
00:17:59,396 --> 00:18:01,330
Just screw already!

460
00:18:01,332 --> 00:18:02,598
Seriously.

461
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,866
Then kill each other.

462
00:18:03,868 --> 00:18:04,867
Then shut up.

463
00:18:04,869 --> 00:18:07,003
And then kill each other again.

464
00:18:07,005 --> 00:18:10,040
And call me, so I can
watch you do it.

465
00:18:10,042 --> 00:18:12,509
Sterling, I don't know
how you did it, but, well,

466
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:15,613
except for Rip's eye you got
everyone home in one piece.

467
00:18:15,615 --> 00:18:16,247
No thanks to you.

468
00:18:16,249 --> 00:18:18,483
Well, it's about time
to did something on your own.

469
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:20,752
Oh for Columbia House!

470
00:18:20,754 --> 00:18:21,920
Record Club!

471
00:18:21,922 --> 00:18:22,587
Archer!

472
00:18:22,589 --> 00:18:24,489
The important thing
is we're home.

473
00:18:24,491 --> 00:18:28,293
And that we spare Malory the details
of your time on pirate island.

474
00:18:28,295 --> 00:18:30,162
Why, what happened?

475
00:18:30,164 --> 00:18:31,229
Nothing!

476
00:18:31,231 --> 00:18:34,666
Well, you know, besides a lot
of um, pretty horrific torture.

477
00:18:34,668 --> 00:18:38,237
Which mother, if you had seen
would have broken your heart.

478
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:39,505
But why dwell on that?

479
00:18:39,507 --> 00:18:40,205
We're home!

480
00:18:40,207 --> 00:18:43,910
- And my mourning period, for um...
- Katya.

481
00:18:43,912 --> 00:18:45,545
Is over, so hey!

482
00:18:45,547 --> 00:18:46,913
It's a happy ending!

483
00:18:46,915 --> 00:18:51,017
Yeah, it's just a
big ol' goddamn fairy tale.

484
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:52,118
Fairy tale.

485
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,586
Uh, phrasing?

486
00:18:53,588 --> 00:18:56,255
Ray, I'm kidding!

487
00:18:56,257 --> 00:18:59,626
Don't be like that!

488
00:18:59,628 --> 00:19:02,461
Oh, gross
keep it moving, cripple!

489
00:19:02,463 --> 00:19:03,262
Shut up.

490
00:19:03,264 --> 00:19:04,429
Ray?

491
00:19:04,431 --> 00:19:06,264
Ray.

492
00:19:06,266 --> 00:19:08,166
Ray!

493
00:19:08,168 --> 00:19:08,967
Oh, okay!

494
00:19:08,969 --> 00:19:11,035
Then I guess just pout!

495
00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:21,818
