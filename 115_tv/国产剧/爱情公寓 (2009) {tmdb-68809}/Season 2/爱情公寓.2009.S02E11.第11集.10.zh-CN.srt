1
00:00:04,836 --> 00:00:06,220
好了 坦白说... 我不擅长约会
Okay, so cards on the table... I'm not that great at dating.

2
00:00:06,254 --> 00:00:08,389
我和前任未婚夫高中起就在一起
My ex-fiancé and I were together since high school,

3
00:00:08,423 --> 00:00:10,624
所以对于约会几乎是菜鸟一只
so I just haven't had a ton of experience at it.

4
00:00:10,659 --> 00:00:13,777
我室友说应该把约会当成游戏
My roommate says you should treat dating as a game.

5
00:00:13,812 --> 00:00:15,563
- 你在干什么? - 我在和他说话
- What are you doing? - I'm talking to this guy.

6
00:00:15,597 --> 00:00:18,048
不是 你为什么说那些话? 好无趣
No, why are you saying what you're saying? It's boring.

7
00:00:18,082 --> 00:00:19,483
什么? 哪里无趣了
What? It's not boring.

8
00:00:19,518 --> 00:00:22,219
抱歉 我朋友要为她的无趣道个歉
I'm sorry. My friend wants to apologize for her boringness.

9
00:00:22,254 --> 00:00:23,987
我不想为我的无趣道歉
I do not want to apologize for my boringness.

10
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:25,923
为了聊表歉意 她会展示她的马铃薯
To make up for it, she'll show you her taters.

11
00:00:25,957 --> 00:00:27,024
- 我的什么? - 你懂的 你的行李架啊
- My what? - You know, your rack.

12
00:00:27,058 --> 00:00:30,261
枪啊 马克杯啊之类的花哨玩意儿
Your guns. Your geegaws. Your jilk mugs.

13
00:00:30,295 --> 00:00:33,814
看吧? 多无趣
See? So boring.


14
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,576
{\an5}一周前


14
00:00:44,042 --> 00:00:46,176
好了 伍悦 决定时间到
Okay, May, it's decision time.

15
00:00:46,211 --> 00:00:48,212
你只能从这三个先生中选两个
You can only choose two of these three gentlemen

16
00:00:48,246 --> 00:00:50,247
参加下周的终极抉择
to be in next week's finale.

17
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:51,999
究竟花落谁家?
Who's it gonna be?

18
00:00:53,752 --> 00:00:55,519
除了与癌症作斗争 这真是我平生
This is the hardest thing I've ever done,

19
00:00:55,554 --> 00:00:57,071
最困难的决定了
besides beat cancer.

20
00:00:57,105 --> 00:00:58,222
你好坚强 伍悦!
You're so strong, May!

21
00:00:58,256 --> 00:00:59,557
谬赞 肖恩
Thank you, Sean.

22
00:00:59,591 --> 00:01:01,926
杰克森...
Jackson...

23
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,010
- 嘿 哦! - 耶!
- Hey-o! - Yeah!

24
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:04,979
你会接受我的黄金弹簧吗?
Will you accept my golden spring?

25
00:01:05,013 --> 00:01:06,597
当然
Absolutely.

26
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:08,599
她没选肖恩我真是太开心了
I am so glad that she didn't pick Sean.

27
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:10,968
噢 我也是 他真是个马屁精
Oh, me, too. He's such a kiss-ass.

28
00:01:10,986 --> 00:01:12,686
你好坚强 伍悦!
"You're so strong, May!"

29
00:01:12,737 --> 00:01:14,021
谁会说那种话?
Who says that?

30
00:01:14,072 --> 00:01:15,940
# 肖恩好无聊 #
# Sean is so lame #

31
00:01:16,354 --> 00:01:18,789
啊 你们还在看"春满五月"?
Ugh. You guys are still watching "Spring Into May"?

32
00:01:18,823 --> 00:01:20,123
难看死了
That show sucks.

33
00:01:20,158 --> 00:01:21,558
詹姆斯对节目主持人超级挑剔
James is super judgy about TV hosts.

34
00:01:21,576 --> 00:01:23,794
看看那小丑
Look at that clown.

35
00:01:23,828 --> 00:01:25,295
我主持的比他好多了
I'm a way better host than he is.

36
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,464
别转台 "春满五月"马上回来
Stay tuned. "Spring Into May" will be right back.

37
00:01:27,498 --> 00:01:28,632
你们应该看过我在比利时
You guys should have seen the dating show

38
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:29,883
主持的相亲节目
I just hosted in Belgium.

39
00:01:29,917 --> 00:01:31,134
情侣们转啊转
And the lovers are spinning.

40
00:01:31,169 --> 00:01:33,036
德尔椎科 你准备迎接
Diedrick, are you ready for your chance

41
00:01:33,054 --> 00:01:34,421
超乎想象的诱惑了么?
at unimaginable lust?

42
00:01:34,472 --> 00:01:35,538
当然!
Ya! 

43
00:01:35,556 --> 00:01:36,706
太棒了!
Wonderbaar!

44
00:01:39,143 --> 00:01:42,596
啊 真好喝 总是这么独一无二
Ahh. Great taste. Always one-of-a-kind.

45
00:01:42,647 --> 00:01:43,597
虽说节目有点乱七八糟
It was a little all over the place.

46
00:01:43,648 --> 00:01:45,098
我是说 那些... 转盘有点危险
I mean, the... the wheels were dangerous.

47
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:47,351
但我有些绝妙的想法
But I had some really good ideas.

48
00:01:47,385 --> 00:01:49,069
如果制片人肯听我的话...
If the producers had just listened to me...

49
00:01:49,103 --> 00:01:50,687
- 闭嘴! - 节目开始了!
- Quiet! - It's back on!

50
00:01:50,721 --> 00:01:52,189
... 然后只剩二十四人 十四人...
... Then down to 24, then 14...

51
00:01:52,223 --> 00:01:54,024
嗯!
Mm! 

52
00:01:54,058 --> 00:01:56,543
哦 呼! 啊
Oh, yeah. Whoo! Whoa. 

53
00:01:56,577 --> 00:01:58,728
克洛伊 我们正在看节目
Chloe, we're trying to watch something.

54
00:01:58,746 --> 00:02:00,914
而我在上某人啊
And I am trying to do someone.

55
00:02:00,948 --> 00:02:03,667
少看点傻乎乎的相亲节目吧
Now stop watching these stupid dating shows

56
00:02:03,701 --> 00:02:05,919
来玩嘛阿朱 出去钓凯子
and get in the game, June. Go out and meet somebody.

57
00:02:05,953 --> 00:02:07,838
我是很有原则的
I have very tough criteria.

58
00:02:07,872 --> 00:02:10,157
对象不能是工作场合 健身馆认识的
He can't be from your work or your gym,

59
00:02:10,191 --> 00:02:11,541
同公寓的邻居也不行
or live in your building.

60
00:02:11,575 --> 00:02:13,677
我们早不是同事了
We don't work together anymore.

61
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:15,345
也得没和克洛伊上过床
And he can't be someone that Chloe slept with,

62
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,797
此等好男天下难寻
which is really hard to find.

63
00:02:16,848 --> 00:02:18,882
嘿? 你觉得我怎么想?
Hello? How do you think I feel?

64
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:21,351
我只和过去没睡过的人上床
I only sleep with guys I haven't slept with before.


65
00:02:21,386 --> 00:02:23,770
我也有焦土政策的
You know my scorched earth policy.

66
00:02:23,805 --> 00:02:26,089
呃 我们其实上过床
Um, we've actually had sex before.

67
00:02:26,107 --> 00:02:29,076
噢 滚出去
Oh. Get out.

68
00:02:29,127 --> 00:02:30,210
这二十四个男人...
These 24 men...

69
00:02:31,429 --> 00:02:35,449
阿朱 纽约男人满山满谷
June, there are tons of guys in New York.

70
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,467
我带你出门钓个去
I'm gonna take you out and help you meet one.

71
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:38,541
面前就有
Right here.

72
00:02:38,553 --> 00:02:40,153
好男一名
A good one.

73
00:02:40,204 --> 00:02:42,956
我人就在她眼前
I mean, I was right there.

74
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,775
为什么阿朱从没考虑过
Why doesn't June ever consider me

75
00:02:44,809 --> 00:02:46,159
和我约会?
as someone she might wanna date?

76
00:02:46,194 --> 00:02:47,434
兄弟啊 你在她朋友圈里
Dude, you're in the friend zone.

77
00:02:47,445 --> 00:02:48,795
她的原则不包括这条
That's not one of her criteria.

78
00:02:48,846 --> 00:02:51,181
这是条潜规则
That's an unspoken criteria.

79
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:53,166
我给那个比利时相亲节目出的主意之一
The friend zone was also one of the ideas I had

80
00:02:53,201 --> 00:02:54,801
就是把朋友圈纳进相亲对象里
to improve that Belgian game show that I hosted.

81
00:02:54,836 --> 00:02:56,436
你看嘛 所有参与者把朋友
See, all the contestants would put their friends

82
00:02:56,471 --> 00:02:59,089
归为一类 或者说"朋友圈"
in an area, or "zone."

83
00:03:00,975 --> 00:03:03,727
听起来... 不错 老兄
That sounds... great, man.

84
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:04,778
是吧?
Right?

85
00:03:06,607 --> 00:03:08,107
好了 我们不是来酒吧坐一整夜
Okay, so we are not here to sit at the bar

86
00:03:08,142 --> 00:03:09,592
大聊特聊卫生棉
and compare tampons all night.

87
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:10,593
我们是来找男人的
We are here to talk to guys.

88
00:03:10,628 --> 00:03:12,495
别用你那蠢原则做借口
And stop using your stupid criteria

89
00:03:12,529 --> 00:03:14,080
好宅在沙发里度日
as an excuse to lay on the couch

90
00:03:14,131 --> 00:03:15,415
吃吃墨西哥三明治
and eat Mexican sandwiches.

91
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:20,336
他的鼻孔会鸣笛耶
His nose is whistling.

92
00:03:20,371 --> 00:03:21,838
他的鼻孔会鸣笛耶
His nose is whistling.

93
00:03:24,024 --> 00:03:25,658
这男人说起话来就像在生气
This guy looks so angry when he talks.

94
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:28,544
他的言辞并不气愤 但看起来气疯了
He's not saying angry words, but he looks so mad.

95
00:03:28,562 --> 00:03:31,781
我是说 他明明在谈论彩虹啊
I mean, he's talking about rainbows.

96
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:34,717
这男的嘴边沾着橘子酱
This guy has orange mouth corners.

97
00:03:34,735 --> 00:03:35,885
他一直在吃邋遢乔三明治
He's been eating a sloppy Joe,

98
00:03:35,903 --> 00:03:38,254
而且没擦过嘴
and he hasn't even wiped his face.

99
00:03:38,288 --> 00:03:40,523
我要帮他擦嘴 速度溜走
I'm just gonna wipe his mouth and get out of here.

100
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:45,911
你刚可做了件好事
Hey, you just did a good deed there.

101
00:03:45,962 --> 00:03:47,629
- 噢 你看见了? - 哦 是啊
- Oh, you saw that? - Oh, yeah.

102
00:03:47,663 --> 00:03:50,582
我也受不了别人脸上粘着食物
I can't stand it when people have food on their face.

103
00:03:50,616 --> 00:03:51,733
那真的...
It's so...

104
00:03:51,768 --> 00:03:53,535
- 恶心 我懂! - 恶心 我懂!
- disgusting. I know! - Disgusting. I know!

105
00:03:53,553 --> 00:03:54,936
除了我的姑奶奶
Except when it's my great aunt.

106
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:57,522
她老了 所以我喜欢帮她擦嘴
She's old, so I like helping her wipe her face.

107
00:03:57,573 --> 00:03:58,623
哇 真温馨
Aw, that's sweet.

108
00:03:58,658 --> 00:04:00,509
总之 我是丹尼尔
Anyway, I'm Daniel.

109
00:04:00,543 --> 00:04:02,844
嗨 我是阿朱
Hi, I'm June.

110
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:04,312
虽这么说略唐突
Okay, this is gonna sound weird,

111
00:04:04,347 --> 00:04:05,731
但你看哈利波特时
but you just like what I imagined

112
00:04:05,782 --> 00:04:08,016
想象的样子一模一样
Harry Potter would look like when I was reading the books.

113
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:10,268
只是... 成人版本的
Only the... the grown-up man version.

114
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,503
我的父母也被杀了
Both my parents were also killed,

115
00:04:11,537 --> 00:04:13,555
不过不是巫师干的
but not by a wizard.

116
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:15,307
我开玩笑的 他们都在康奈迪克州...
I'm kidding. They're in Connecticut...

117
00:04:15,358 --> 00:04:17,075
活得好好的
leading very active lives.

118
00:04:18,294 --> 00:04:19,828
我请你喝一杯好吗?
Can I buy you a drink?

119
00:04:19,846 --> 00:04:21,613
好啊 当然 谢谢
Yeah. Sure. Thank you.

120
00:04:25,824 --> 00:04:27,324
哦 老天 说出来你一定不相信
Oh, God, you're never gonna believe this.

121
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:28,409
好吧
Okay.

122
00:04:28,443 --> 00:04:30,594
不 不是 我刚刚邂逅了一个帅哥
No, no, I think I just met someone.

123
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:32,346
很帅又打着光棍
He's cute and he's single,

124
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,915
而且跟他的姑奶奶相处融洽
and he has a good relationship with his great aunt.

125
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,050
不错啊 约他出去
Good. Ask him out.

126
00:04:36,084 --> 00:04:37,218
真的吗? 就这么约?
Really? Just like that?

127
00:04:37,252 --> 00:04:38,169
当然 你漂亮可人
Of course. You're gorgeous.

128
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,136
他将成为这儿最幸运的小伙子
He'll be the luckiest guy here.

129
00:04:39,171 --> 00:04:40,855
你记得稍微抹些唇彩
Just touch up your lip gloss a bit.

130
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:42,156
哦 好 我补一下妆
Yeah. All right. I'll do it.

131
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,157
好
Okay.

132
00:04:50,816 --> 00:04:52,137
嘿 想不想找机会出门逛逛?
Hey, do you wanna go out sometime?

133
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,635
哇 你在约我吗?
Wow. You're asking me out?

134
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:55,603
是啊 很奇怪吗?
Yeah. Is that weird?

135
00:04:55,637 --> 00:04:57,972
不 不 荣幸之至
No, no. It's awesome.

136
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,473
就是有点奇怪
The only weird thing

137
00:04:59,491 --> 00:05:01,158
一分钟之内有两个姑娘
is that two different girls just asked me out

138
00:05:01,193 --> 00:05:02,760
同时约我
in the span of one minute.

139
00:05:02,794 --> 00:05:04,512
还有谁?
What other girl asked you out?

140
00:05:04,546 --> 00:05:06,547
哦 那个姑娘
Uh, that girl right over there.

141
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,676
你这双小短腿跑的挺快
You walk fast for your leg length.

142
00:05:19,711 --> 00:05:21,178
你答应过帮我钓汉子
You were supposed to be helping me meet a guy,

143
00:05:21,212 --> 00:05:22,679
而不是亲身上阵
not finding one for yourself.

144
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,377
你究竟什么时候去约他的?
When did you even have time to ask him out?

145
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,566
你抹唇彩的时候
When you were putting on your lip gloss.

146
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,484
调虎离山之计
That was a diversion tactic on my part.

147
00:05:27,502 --> 00:05:29,720
说实话你裹得太严实了
Frankly, you were kind of already wearing too much.

148
00:05:29,754 --> 00:05:31,104
为什么要这么捉弄我?
Why would you do that to me?

149
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,779
我就是爱夺人所好
I've always wanted what other people want.

150
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:35,158
没人要的东西谁稀罕?
You take something that's available... who wants that?

151
00:05:35,193 --> 00:05:36,660
但是从别人那里抢过来...
Take something from someone...

152
00:05:36,694 --> 00:05:37,711
价逾千金
value.

153
00:05:37,762 --> 00:05:39,763
难以置信 这又不是游戏
Unbelievable. This is not a game.

154
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,366
但是可以是哦
But it could be.

155
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,402
唔 詹姆斯一直在那儿坐着吗?
Ooh. James has been sitting in that chair the whole time?

156
00:05:45,436 --> 00:05:47,104
我被你迷死了 詹姆斯
I'm intrigued, James.

157
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,473
你俩可以竞争约会 那位帅哥尊姓大名?
You two could compete for this guy. What's his name?

158
00:05:49,507 --> 00:05:51,074
- 丹尼尔 - 我哪能知道
- Daniel. - No earthly idea.

159
00:05:51,108 --> 00:05:52,442
我来定规则 顺便融入我想用在
I'll set the rules, incorporating the ideas

160
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,294
比利时相亲节目的那点子
that I wanted to use in Belgium.

161
00:05:54,345 --> 00:05:55,646
要是有成效
And if it works,

162
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,964
我来把它包装成电视节目 亲自主持
I'll pitch it as a TV show and host it myself.

163
00:05:57,998 --> 00:06:00,266
不行! 你不能这么玩弄别人的感情
No! You can't toy with a person like that.

164
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,452
再说我永远不会跟克洛伊抢男人
Besides, I would never compete against Chloe for a guy.

165
00:06:03,487 --> 00:06:05,905
她会第一时间跟那个男人上床
The first thing she'd do is just sleep with him.

166
00:06:05,956 --> 00:06:06,955
知己啊
You know it.

167
00:06:06,974 --> 00:06:08,541
好吧 阿朱 鉴于这是事实
Well, June, as it just so happens,

168
00:06:08,575 --> 00:06:10,977
我的规则之一就是前五次约会不准上床
one of my rules is no sex for the first five dates.

169
00:06:11,011 --> 00:06:12,862
这样 克洛伊就不能占便宜了
That way Chloe can't gain an unfair advantage.

170
00:06:12,896 --> 00:06:13,946
嘘
Boo.

171
00:06:13,981 --> 00:06:15,615
换句话说要么我不参与游戏
So basically, either I don't play,

172
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:18,901
这样克洛伊就会跟丹尼尔上床 我就不能约他了
in which case Chloe sleeps with Daniel and makes him undatable,

173
00:06:18,935 --> 00:06:21,537
要么我参与 还有机会和她约会
or I actually play, and I have a chance to date him.

174
00:06:21,571 --> 00:06:23,189
- 很好 加你了 - 好吧 我不干了
- Great. You're in. - Yeah, well, I'm out.

175
00:06:23,223 --> 00:06:25,374
约五次都不上床还不折磨死我了
No sex for five dates sounds like torture.

176
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:26,993
太好了 那丹尼尔归我了
Awesome. So I get Daniel.

177
00:06:27,044 --> 00:06:28,995
不行 你想约他? 他是我的 我参加!
No. You want him? He's mine. I'm back in. Value!

178
00:06:29,046 --> 00:06:30,379
完美! 
Perfect! Okay.

179
00:06:30,414 --> 00:06:33,716
趁着我们单身 赶紧交往吧
Let's mingle while we're single.

180
00:06:34,784 --> 00:06:35,751
游戏就是这样开始的
That's how the game starts.

181
00:06:35,785 --> 00:06:36,869
我刚刚宣布游戏正式开始了
The game just officially started.

182
00:06:36,903 --> 00:06:38,287
太不明显了
That wasn't clear.

183
00:06:47,369 --> 00:06:49,503
好 游戏的基本规则是这样的
Okay, so here are the basic rules of the game...

184
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:51,739
不能让丹尼尔知道你们在竞争
Daniel cannot know you're competing for him.

185
00:06:51,773 --> 00:06:53,874
你们每个人可以跟他约会五次 不能发生关系
You will each go on five platonic dates.

186
00:06:53,908 --> 00:06:55,676
你们每个人都会拿到一张中途插一腿牌
You will each get an interruption card,

187
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,945
一张缓冲牌  一张乾坤大扭转牌
a cool-down card, and a monkey wrench card

188
00:06:57,979 --> 00:06:59,313
什么时候都可以用
which can be played at any time.

189
00:06:59,347 --> 00:07:00,397
你还做了卡片?
You had cards made up?

190
00:07:00,432 --> 00:07:01,415
漂亮吧?
Aren't they beautiful?

191
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:02,616
也不全是我的功劳啦
I can't take all the credit.

192
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,852
复印店的老板娘也出了些好点子
The woman at Kinko's had some great thoughts.

193
00:07:04,886 --> 00:07:05,803
- 有问题 - 请讲
- Question. - Yes.

194
00:07:05,837 --> 00:07:06,787
我们能痛扁卢瑟一顿吗?
Can we punch Luther?

195
00:07:06,821 --> 00:07:09,173
不能 每次约会结束后
No. So at the end of each date,

196
00:07:09,207 --> 00:07:11,058
我会计算出你们跟丹尼尔
I will count out the number of true connection moments

197
00:07:11,092 --> 00:07:12,459
来电的次数
you each have with Daniel.

198
00:07:12,494 --> 00:07:13,661
次数多者胜
Whoever has the most wins the round,

199
00:07:13,695 --> 00:07:15,729
而且可以在下一次约会中
and gets... Beek bucks

200
00:07:16,504 --> 00:07:17,937
使用我们的奖品比克元
to use on their next date.

201
00:07:17,972 --> 00:07:19,439
这是我去年复活节
These are from the Van Der Beek Monopoly set

202
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:20,557
在范德・比克专卖店做的
I made last easter.

203
00:07:20,591 --> 00:07:22,092
卢瑟 你今天很在状态嘛
Luther, you are on it today.

204
00:07:22,143 --> 00:07:23,059
我昨晚睡得很香哦
I got great sleep last night.

205
00:07:26,731 --> 00:07:28,631
我也想参加 不管是哪个男的
I wanna play. I don't even care who the guy is.

206
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,150
我就是想跟克洛伊做游戏
I just wanna play a game with Chloe.

207
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:31,618
好啊 多元化 进来吧
Great. Diversity. Get in here.

208
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:33,352
耶!
Eee! Yes!

209
00:07:34,842 --> 00:07:35,758
- 组个联盟吗? - 不行
- Form an alliance? - No.

210
00:07:35,809 --> 00:07:36,859
好吧 也行
This is great.

211
00:07:36,894 --> 00:07:37,860
第一轮
For the first round,

212
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:38,828
我需要你们每个人在那张纸上
I need you to write down your ideal date

213
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:39,812
写下你们理想的约会是什么样的
on that sheet of paper.

214
00:07:45,752 --> 00:07:47,219
这么说呢
So...

215
00:07:47,237 --> 00:07:49,822
阿朱你的第一次约会
for your first date, June,

216
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,891
你要去...去地牢
you will be going... to a dungeon.

217
00:07:51,925 --> 00:07:53,209
等等 我...我没写"地牢"啊
Wait. I... I didn't write down "dungeon."

218
00:07:53,243 --> 00:07:54,360
我写的是"野餐"
I wrote down "picnic."

219
00:07:54,378 --> 00:07:55,378
你和克洛伊要互换选择
You and Chloe are switching dates.

220
00:07:55,412 --> 00:07:56,362
不会吧!
No!

221
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,064
天 太好玩儿了 我是不是很变态?
God. I'm weirdly into this.

222
00:07:58,098 --> 00:07:59,248
我知道整件事很疯狂
I knew the whole thing was crazy,

223
00:07:59,283 --> 00:08:01,434
但是我真的很喜欢丹尼尔
but I really liked Daniel.

224
00:08:01,628 --> 00:08:03,663
我们就在酒吧里聊过几分钟
I mean, we only chatted for a few minutes in the bar,

225
00:08:03,697 --> 00:08:05,381
但是我很久都没有
but I hadn't felt a connection like that

226
00:08:05,432 --> 00:08:07,817
这种来电的感觉了
with someone in a long time.

227
00:08:07,851 --> 00:08:10,670
所以我想我还是去地牢...
So I guess I'm going on a date...

228
00:08:10,704 --> 00:08:11,970
约会吧
In a dungeon.

229
00:08:11,988 --> 00:08:13,289
我公寓里有一个通风口
I have a vent in my apartment

230
00:08:13,323 --> 00:08:16,142
我能听到23号公寓的一切动静
that lets me hear everything going on in apartment 23.

231
00:08:16,176 --> 00:08:17,777
我很纳闷 他们怎么从来没问过我
It's weird they never ask me

232
00:08:17,811 --> 00:08:19,945
我是怎么掌握他们的所有动向的
how I always know what's happening.

233
00:08:19,963 --> 00:08:23,432
或者 我怎么把我的月经周期跟克洛伊调成一样的
Or how I've trained my body to get on Chloe's cycle.

234
00:08:29,795 --> 00:08:32,597
所以 这是一个地牢
So... this is a dungeon.

235
00:08:32,632 --> 00:08:34,032
是
Yeah.

236
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:37,001
我知道 这儿有点儿诡异
I know, it's... it's kind of weird.

237
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:40,122
不是 我只是很惊讶你怎么会选这个地方
No. I'm just surprised you chose this place.

238
00:08:40,173 --> 00:08:41,506
惊喜吗?
Good surprised?

239
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,774
更像是
More like

240
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:45,377
"我为什么要穿休闲鞋来这种地方"式的惊喜
"why did I wear loafers to a dungeon?" surprised.

241
00:08:46,462 --> 00:08:47,846
嘿 想再来点酒吗?
Hey, are you ready for another one?

242
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,514
好的 谢谢
Yes, please.

243
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:54,618
发卡 发卡 发猴卡
Card. Card. Monkey card.

244
00:08:54,653 --> 00:08:56,253
我出卡打断你的约会
I interrupt your date with cards.

245
00:08:56,288 --> 00:08:57,421
快走开
Get outta here.

246
00:08:57,439 --> 00:08:59,773
丹尼尔和我刚刚来 我可不走
Daniel and I just got here. I am not leaving.

247
00:08:59,808 --> 00:09:01,358
呃 这就是游戏规则啊 阿朱
Um, those are the rules of the game, June.

248
00:09:01,393 --> 00:09:03,010
你想打破游戏规则?
Do you really wanna break the rules of the game?

249
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:04,145
我不知道游戏规则
I didn't know the rules of the game.

250
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:06,497
我只是想把那几张牌甩出去然后大喊
I just wanted to slam down the cards and yell.

251
00:09:06,531 --> 00:09:08,132
我讨厌游戏
I hate games.

252
00:09:10,168 --> 00:09:11,469
丹尼尔								
Daniel.

253
00:09:11,503 --> 00:09:13,020
克洛伊
Chloe.

254
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:15,773
哇 在这碰到你可真奇怪
Wow. That is so weird running into you here.

255
00:09:15,807 --> 00:09:17,741
我们不是明天见面吗?
We're seeing each other tomorrow, right?

256
00:09:19,261 --> 00:09:21,011
让我告诉你她有急事
She asked me to tell you she had an emergency.

257
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:23,247
然后捂着她的嘴和屁股跑出去了
She ran out of here holding her mouth and her butt.

258
00:09:23,265 --> 00:09:24,215
噢天哪
Oh, my God.

259
00:09:24,249 --> 00:09:25,432
不说她啦
Anyway, enough about her.

260
00:09:25,467 --> 00:09:27,768
我在这哪 这算是个约会
I'm here now, and this counts as a date.

261
00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:29,587
还有四次就可以上床了
Only four more until sex.

262
00:09:32,591 --> 00:09:34,692
走一个!
My man!

263
00:09:38,109 --> 00:09:40,744



264
00:09:40,778 --> 00:09:42,462
有点难以预料
It's a little predictable.

265
00:09:42,497 --> 00:09:44,331
就是...很好 但不是特别好
I just... it's good. It's not great.

266
00:09:44,382 --> 00:09:45,582
我觉得我需要把事情白热化
I feel like I need to shake things up, you know?

267
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,185
搞个出乎意料的问题什么的
Throw a curveball at 'em or something.

268
00:09:48,219 --> 00:09:49,586
你说啥?
What are you talking about?

269
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,654
我给阿朱和克洛伊搞的约会游戏的节目啊
Dating show I'm work-shopping with June and Chloe.

270
00:09:51,672 --> 00:09:53,840
我这个节目的点子太棒了
I'm really on to something with this show idea,

271
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,258
只是...好像落了什么
I just... I'm missing something.

272
00:09:55,293 --> 00:09:56,827
你看约会节目 有什么主意吗?
You watch dating shows. Any ideas?

273
00:09:56,861 --> 00:09:58,929
你想让我帮着阿朱约会?
You want me to help set June up on dates?

274
00:09:59,243 --> 00:10:02,028
这种事我是绝对不会干的
That's the exact opposite of something I'd be into.

275
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,496
等等 你还喜欢她吗?

没那么长时间吧
It hasn't been that long.

277
00:10:04,849 --> 00:10:06,399

280
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:22,985
真无聊
This sucks.

281
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:24,954
野餐是你的主意
This picnic was your idea.

282
00:10:24,988 --> 00:10:26,722
你干嘛只带一个椅子?
Why'd you only bring one chair?

283
00:10:26,756 --> 00:10:29,074
丹尼尔 我不...
Daniel, I don't...

284
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,509
我不知道 丹尼尔 
I don't know, Daniel.

285
00:10:30,543 --> 00:10:33,095
你想来点吃的吗?
Do you want some food or something?

286

威士忌?
Whiskey?

287
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:37,449
蛋?
An egg?

288

那就 来个蛋吧
An egg, I guess.

289
00:10:43,023 --> 00:10:44,139
噢
Oh!

290
00:10:44,173 --> 00:10:46,608
老天! 蛋是生的!
God! It's not even hard-boiled!

291
00:10:46,626 --> 00:10:47,576
咋啦?
What?

292
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,662
不管了 这得算是一次约会
Anyway, this counts as a date.

293
00:10:49,696 --> 00:10:52,281
只有三次就可以上床啦
Only three more until sex.

294
00:10:52,315 --> 00:10:54,016
哦 等你搞完之后
Oh, and when you're done,

295
00:10:54,034 --> 00:10:56,802
这把椅子得换到托尼聚会租赁店去

296

你欠他50块
You owe him 50 bucks.

297
00:10:58,271 --> 00:11:00,689
这价钱跟抢似的
His prices are pretty unreasonable.

298
00:11:05,114 --> 00:11:06,514
好的 姑娘们
Okay, ladies,

299
00:11:06,549 --> 00:11:07,849
游戏进行到现在

300
00:11:07,883 --> 00:11:09,084
你们都没有与丹尼尔有什么实质性的
none of you have scored any true connection moments

301
00:11:09,118 --> 00:11:10,201
进展
with Daniel.

302
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:11,286
我本来要有的
I would've had one

303
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,771
要是克洛伊没有打断我的约会的话

304
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:15,189
洛冰 你甚至都没有去尝试与丹尼尔见面
Now, Robin, you haven't even tried to meet Daniel yet.

305
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:16,408
呃 我知道

306
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,243
身边男孩子太多了
I've got dudes comin' out of my ears.

307
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,361
这太荒唐了
This is ridiculous.

308
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:21,496
我是唯一一个真正喜欢他的
I am the only one who likes this guy.

309
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,170
那么 现在就有一个机会让你去证明的

What?

365
00:13:09,731 --> 00:13:10,237

马克没有喜欢上我

368
00:13:13,143 --> 00:13:14,381
把这个当作节目的小插曲

369
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:15,634

重点是你现在在这了

拍屁股
Buttocks.

385
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,011
精神分叉
Mind forked.

386
00:13:50,766 --> 00:13:51,797
我混乱了
I was flustered.

387
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:53,639
如果马克真的喜欢我
If Mark really did have a crush on me...

388
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,606
对了 这可真是一个不小的"如果"
which, by the way, is a big "if"...

389
00:13:56,096 --> 00:13:57,377
我现在不可能去想那个
I couldn't think about that right then.

390
00:13:57,392 --> 00:13:58,423
我必须集中在丹尼尔身上
I had to focus on Daniel

391
00:13:58,438 --> 00:13:59,514
准备迎接下一个挑战
and the next challenge.

392
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,611
我们见了丹尼尔他那伟大的姑姑
We were meeting Daniel's great aunt.

393
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:03,524
我们想听她说她认为
We had to get her to say which girl

394
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,266
对丹尼尔来说什么样的女孩才是最好的
she thought was best for Daniel.

395
00:14:05,786 --> 00:14:08,764
但是我高兴的是可以和克洛伊分一个肉馅饼
But I was just happy to split a potpie with Chloe.

396
00:14:08,834 --> 00:14:10,801
你什么意思 我们不能分一个?
What do you mean, we can't split it?

397
00:14:10,801 --> 00:14:12,178
小姐 这是肉馅饼
Ma'am. It's a pot pie.

398
00:14:12,213 --> 00:14:13,699
里面的馅都会散出来的
All the stuff inside it will spill out.

399
00:14:13,724 --> 00:14:15,191
这和你有什么关系呢?
Why is it just problems with you?

400
00:14:15,311 --> 00:14:17,363
丹尼尔真的是个很棒的男人
So Daniel seems like a really great guy,

401
00:14:17,393 --> 00:14:19,475
他非常爱您
and he loves you very much.

402
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,697
我喜欢您的 面罩
I like your... face hat.

403
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,211
我很珍惜更好得了解他的机会
I'd really like the chance to get to know him better,

404
00:14:25,216 --> 00:14:26,883
- 所以如果您可以 - 好啦
- so if you could just... - Okay.

405
00:14:26,898 --> 00:14:28,520
准备好接受又一个小插曲了吗?
Are you ready for the next twist?

406
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,668
现在遇到了双重精神分叉
Because here comes the double mind fork.

407
00:14:32,479 --> 00:14:33,580
丹尼尔
Daniel.

408
00:14:33,616 --> 00:14:34,981
爱吉姑姑 你没事吧?
Aunt Aggie, are you okay?

409
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,914
你不能吃这的东西
You can't eat anything here.

410
00:14:36,951 --> 00:14:39,277
你们两个是怎么回事?
What is wrong with you two?

411
00:14:39,447 --> 00:14:42,730
我 我接到了詹姆斯・范德・ 比克的电话
I... I get a phone call from James Van Der Beek,

412
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,807
他告诉我你们把我姑姑
telling me that you stole my great aunt

413
00:14:44,832 --> 00:14:46,224
从养老院里面偷走了?
from her retirement home?

414
00:14:46,414 --> 00:14:48,406
我 我都不知道你们两个居然认识
I... I had no idea you two even knew each other.

415
00:14:48,401 --> 00:14:50,468
现在我发现你们正在玩着
And now I find out you're playing

416
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,660
什么无聊的真实约会的游戏?
some sick, real-life dating game?

417
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,918
嗨 我是洛冰 我也是竞争者
Hi. I'm Robin. I'm competing for you, too.

418
00:14:55,973 --> 00:14:57,830
另外说下 我不是喜欢你
P.S., I'm not attracted to you.

419
00:14:58,822 --> 00:14:59,902
丹尼尔 我很抱歉
Daniel, I'm so sorry.

420
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:01,214
我以为这是唯一的
I thought this was the only way

421
00:15:01,219 --> 00:15:03,256
可以了解你的方法
that I'd have a chance to get to know you.

422
00:15:03,276 --> 00:15:05,258
好吧 你太疯狂了
Well, then, you're crazy.

423
00:15:05,563 --> 00:15:08,216
太疯狂了 你们都有病
This is crazy. You're all insane.

424
00:15:08,248 --> 00:15:09,528
哦 我的天
Oh, my gosh.

425
00:15:09,568 --> 00:15:11,445
我真不应该听你的
I should have never listened to you.

426
00:15:11,565 --> 00:15:13,631
我喜欢他 现在都毁了
I like this guy, and now it's all ruined,

427
00:15:13,636 --> 00:15:15,263
- 全是因为你 - 嘿
- because of you. - Hey.

428
00:15:15,308 --> 00:15:16,700
我也喜欢他
I liked him, too.

429
00:15:17,275 --> 00:15:18,606
只是因为我先喜欢他
Only because I liked him.

430
00:15:18,647 --> 00:15:19,783
洛冰在这是因为你
And Robin's here because of you,

431
00:15:19,788 --> 00:15:22,246
而詹姆斯在这是因为他那愚蠢的游戏
and James is here because of his stupid game.

432
00:15:22,286 --> 00:15:23,697
是很蠢
It is stupid.

433
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:25,615
对不起 詹姆斯
I'm sorry, James,

434
00:15:25,655 --> 00:15:27,812
但是这游戏真的很无聊
but it is a dumb game.

435
00:15:27,997 --> 00:15:31,931
没有任何意义
This isn't connected to anything. 

436
00:15:32,572 --> 00:15:34,068
哦 太可笑了
Oh, this is ridiculous.

437
00:15:34,098 --> 00:15:35,980
我不应该让你说服我去做任何事的
I should have never let you talk me into something

438
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,328
既骗人又低劣
so dishonest and mean.

439
00:15:43,123 --> 00:15:46,267
好啦 爱吉姑姑 现在没事啦
Okay, Aunt Aggie, everything is fine now.

440
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:48,595
哇 这儿闻上去有股坚果味
Blah! Whoa. It smells like nuts in here.

441
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:51,061
怎么回事? 我想我已经说得很清楚了
What? I thought I made myself clear.

442
00:15:51,042 --> 00:15:53,749
我不想和你们有任何瓜葛
I don't want anything to do with you.

443
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:55,132
首先 我不相信你
First of all, I don't believe you.

444
00:15:55,137 --> 00:15:58,306
其次 我不是为我自己来的 我是为了阿朱
And second, I'm not here for me. I'm here for June.

445
00:15:58,571 --> 00:16:01,919
听着 她一点都不想参加这个鬼游戏
Look, she didn't want anything to do with this stupid game.

446
00:16:01,964 --> 00:16:04,548
她只是想用正常的无聊的方式和你约会
She just wanted to date you in a normal, boring way,

447
00:16:04,668 --> 00:16:06,279
而我和詹姆斯不想让她那样
and James and I didn't let that happen.

448
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:07,797
所以你应该再给她一次机会
So she deserves another chance.

449
00:16:07,822 --> 00:16:10,109
不要因为我们做的事对她生气
Don't be mad at her for what we did.

450
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:11,961
听着 我很抱歉
Look, I'm sorry,

451
00:16:11,956 --> 00:16:13,558
但是阿朱可以不这样做的
but June didn't have to go along with it

452
00:16:13,588 --> 00:16:14,564
如果她真的不想
if she didn't want to.

453
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:15,765
现在请离开
Now please leave

454
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,642
我会忘掉发生的一切的
so I can forget this ever happened.

455
00:16:19,714 --> 00:16:20,349
什么?
What?

456
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,162
哦 那东西说话了?
Oh, that thing talks?

457
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,506
阿朱是个好姑娘 去找她
June's a good girl. Go to her.

458
00:16:27,267 --> 00:16:29,804
你能相信那个老太太说"去找她"了吗?
Can you believe the old lady said "go to her"?

459
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:32,878
我是说 这节目太棒了
I mean... that's great television.

460
00:16:33,324 --> 00:16:34,654
我不知道卢瑟在说什么
I don't know what Luther's talking about.

461
00:16:34,674 --> 00:16:36,146
我的节目太神奇了
My show's incredible.

462
00:16:39,024 --> 00:16:40,510
马克
Mark,

463
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,603
第一手的好消息
I got a hit on my hands.

464
00:16:43,173 --> 00:16:44,425
所有的插曲和曲折
All the twists and turns...

465
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,032
精神分叉真的把整个节目提升了一个层次
the mind fork really took the whole game to another level

466
00:16:47,032 --> 00:16:48,839
当我告诉阿朱你喜欢她的时候
when I told June you had a crush on her.

467
00:16:49,469 --> 00:16:51,662
你告诉阿朱我喜欢她?
You told June I have a crush on her?

468
00:16:51,832 --> 00:16:53,341
你怎么能这么做?
How could you do that?

469
00:16:53,955 --> 00:16:55,296
哦 伙计
Oh, dude...

470
00:16:55,897 --> 00:16:57,048
这对我的节目有好处
it helped my game.

471
00:16:57,168 --> 00:16:58,414
哦 现在一团乱 哥们!
Well, that's messed up, man!

472
00:16:58,432 --> 00:17:00,171
你的节目甚至还不是真的
Your game isn't even real.

473
00:17:00,496 --> 00:17:01,902
我 她.. 她怎么说的?
I... wh... what did she say?

474
00:17:01,936 --> 00:17:03,780
实际上 她没说什么
Well, not much, really.

475
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,597
我是说 她很快地转回到丹尼尔的事情上了
I mean, she got back on Daniel pretty quick.

476
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:06,778
她没事
She's fine.

477
00:17:06,854 --> 00:17:09,226
哦 很好 我也没事
Oh, good, 'cause I'm fine, too.

478
00:17:09,516 --> 00:17:12,004
我们今晚本来要一起看"五月的春天"的大结局的
We're supposed to watch the finale of "Spring Into May"

479
00:17:12,004 --> 00:17:15,007
现在也没问题啦
together tonight, and that'll be fine... too.

480
00:17:15,277 --> 00:17:16,764
看见没? 人人都是赢家
See? Everybody wins

481
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,656
一切尽在詹姆斯・范德・ 比克出品的节目
on "James Van Der Beek presents:

482
00:17:19,126 --> 00:17:21,944
约会... 交换... 细节... 叉子
Date... swap... trivia... fork."

483
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:25,593
我还没想好名字 我想不出合适的名字马克
I don't have it yet. I don't have the name, Mark.

484
00:17:26,024 --> 00:17:27,175
我得出去跑两圈
I'm gonna go for a run.

485
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:50,321
丹尼尔 你怎么来了?
Daniel. What are you doing here?

486
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:51,712
克洛伊和爱吉姨妈
Chloe and Aunt Aggie

487
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,514
说服我前来再给你一次机会
convinced me to give you another chance.

488
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:56,012
克洛伊? 我家克洛伊?
Chloe? My Chloe?

489
00:17:56,032 --> 00:17:57,023
我当时很郁闷
I was upset.

490
00:17:57,714 --> 00:18:00,207
我不想成为别人什么游戏中的赌注
I don't appreciate being a pawn in someone else's game.

491
00:18:00,237 --> 00:18:03,485
但是我喜欢你 你看起来像是个好人
But I like you, and you seem like a good person.

492
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:04,642
对不起
I'm sorry.

493
00:18:04,967 --> 00:18:06,509
我再不参加什么游戏了
No more games.

494
00:18:06,629 --> 00:18:08,886
我保证 未来只有你我二人
Just me and you, I promise.

495
00:18:09,326 --> 00:18:11,553
进屋吧 我正好要开始看这季
Come in. I'm actually watching the season finale

496
00:18:11,563 --> 00:18:12,650
May的又一春的大结局(双关这个要解释不)
of "Spring Into May,"

497
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,927
May马上就要给出她的黄金弹簧了
and May is about to give out her final golden spring.

498
00:18:15,463 --> 00:18:17,440
我知道是个脑残节目 但是很好看
I know it's stupid, but it's fun.

499
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,911
来个卷饼?
Do you want a burrito?

500
00:18:18,911 --> 00:18:20,518
不 不要 我讨厌卷饼
Oh, God, no. I hate burritos.

501
00:18:20,518 --> 00:18:21,439
怎么会有人喜欢
Why would I like a food

502
00:18:21,444 --> 00:18:23,356
把所有的料都包起来看不到的食物?
that hides all its ingredients from view?

503
00:18:23,547 --> 00:18:25,764
这就好比 你买了双鞋
It's like, let's buy a pair of shoes

504
00:18:25,764 --> 00:18:27,626
但是只把它们放鞋盒里
and just keep 'em in the box.

505
00:18:27,985 --> 00:18:29,536
这不是一回事
It's really not the same thing.

506
00:18:29,587 --> 00:18:30,359
就是一回事
It kind of is.

507
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:31,602
不是 实际上...
No, it's actually...

508
00:18:31,722 --> 00:18:33,056
这两件事...
it's not even close to...

509
00:18:33,074 --> 00:18:34,769
我为什么要替卷饼说话?
you know, why am I defending burritos?

510
00:18:34,788 --> 00:18:36,426
再说下去节目就要结束了
We are missing the show.

511
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,610
May 现在
So, May,

512
00:18:37,628 --> 00:18:39,261
是你好好想清楚的时候了
you've had a chance to think it all through.

513
00:18:39,537 --> 00:18:40,513
你会选择谁?
Who's it gonna be?

514
00:18:41,499 --> 00:18:44,097
做这个动作其实挺好玩的 为结局做铺垫
It's kind of fun if you do this, get into it.

515
00:18:44,217 --> 00:18:45,819
这看起来很怪
That's pretty weird.

516
00:18:48,576 --> 00:18:50,841
他能否改变May的心意?
Could he have warned May any differently?

517
00:18:50,891 --> 00:18:52,743
所以这是她男朋友还是别的什么人?
So is that her boyfriend or something?

518
00:18:52,781 --> 00:18:54,345
不是 那是... 那是节目主持人
No, that... that's the host.

519
00:18:54,465 --> 00:18:57,605
一开始上场24位男嘉宾 然后慢慢减少到...
It started as 24 men, then down to...

520
00:18:57,611 --> 00:19:00,089
所以 这姑娘是很有名还是...
So is she, like, a famous person or...

521
00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:02,210
她... 她就是以普通姑娘
She's... she's a regular girl.

522
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,081
你能别说话么? 我听不清节目了
But can you just be quiet, though, so we can hear?

523
00:19:04,506 --> 00:19:06,865
得 知道了
Right. Got it.

524
00:19:06,834 --> 00:19:08,578
最终决定她选择...
Make her final decision as to who...

525
00:19:08,698 --> 00:19:11,501
嘿 你除了卷饼还有别的吃的不?
Hey, do you have anything else to eat besides burritos?

526
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:13,084
别是蛋卷就行了
And obviously not an egg roll,

527
00:19:13,093 --> 00:19:14,651
你知道的... 一样的问题
'cause... same issue.

528
00:19:14,939 --> 00:19:15,899
稍后即将播出
Coming up next,

529
00:19:15,912 --> 00:19:19,159
我们看看最终她将选择哪位幸运儿 不要走开 马上回来
we'll see which lucky guy she chooses.Stay tuned.

530
00:19:21,962 --> 00:19:23,516
抱歉 丹尼尔
I'm sorry, Daniel.

531
00:19:23,866 --> 00:19:26,632
我突然想到要去个地方
I just realized there's somewhere else I need to be.

532
00:19:27,727 --> 00:19:29,028
啥?
What?

533
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:31,093
我只是不觉得我们会有结果
I just don't think we're gonna work out.

534
00:19:32,973 --> 00:19:34,171
哈罗!
Hi!

535
00:19:34,221 --> 00:19:36,441
哈罗! 你们这对小鸳鸯
Well, hello, lovebirds.

536
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,806
不 我们不是小鸳鸯
No. No lovebirds.

537
00:19:38,831 --> 00:19:40,339
我们不会成功的
It's not gonna work out.

538
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:42,510
但是我很高兴你找他谈过了
But thank you so much for having a chat with him.

539
00:19:42,547 --> 00:19:43,623
你真是个好人
That was very cool of you.

540
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,800
我就是好人
I'm pretty cool.

541
00:19:48,022 --> 00:19:49,211
所以...
So...

542
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:51,545
你想找点事做做吗?
you wanna do stuff?

543
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:52,625
什么事?
What do you mean?

544
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,630
你懂得 那种... 事
You know, like... stuff.

545
00:19:56,102 --> 00:19:57,186
我滴个神啊
Oh, my God.

546
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,571
就算没有阿朱和我抢
I wanna hook up with you

547
00:19:58,588 --> 00:20:00,170
我都愿意和你约一炮
even though June doesn't want to anymore.

548
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,649
这就是成长啊
That's growth.

549
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:04,390
这是成长 我真为你骄傲啊 克洛伊
That is growth. I'm proud of you, Chloe.

550
00:20:04,377 --> 00:20:05,844
谢谢啦 上帝
Thanks, God!

551
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,660
我没有打扰到你吧
I hope it's okay that I'm here.

552
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,540
当然... 当然不打扰
Yeah. Of... of course.

553
00:20:18,591 --> 00:20:20,551
没有你我看不下去大结局
I couldn't watch the finale without you.

554
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,761
感觉都不一样了
It just wouldn't be the same.

555
00:20:22,796 --> 00:20:25,047
马克 你愿意接受
Mark, will you accept...

556
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,499
我的银色卷饼吗?
my silver burrito?

557
00:20:30,018 --> 00:20:31,582
我愿意
I will. Yes.

558
00:20:34,307 --> 00:20:35,930
我错过啥了没?
Did I miss anything?

559
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,664
有 大概十四条的衣物柔顺剂的广告
Yeah, like, 14 commercials for fabric softener.

560
00:20:38,702 --> 00:20:40,941
May还没最后一次给出她的黄金弹簧?
So May hasn't given out her final golden spring?

561
00:20:40,966 --> 00:20:42,993
还没 节目不停地在拖
No. They drag these things out so much.

562
00:20:43,015 --> 00:20:45,699
让他们拖吧
Yeah. It's okay.

563
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:47,536
本来我就不想着节目结束
I kind of never want it to end.

564
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,422
我也是
Yeah. Me, too.

565
00:20:52,075 --> 00:20:54,097
别忘了收看九月播出的
Don't forget to tune in this September

566
00:20:54,122 --> 00:20:56,375
爱上Autumn（又是个双关 这个也不知道怎么体现）预告片
for the premiere of "Fall Into Autumn."

567
00:21:02,248 --> 00:21:04,244
最终我都没提
So I didn't bring up

568
00:21:04,256 --> 00:21:05,983
马克对我有意思 这档子事
the whole "Mark having a crush on me" thing

569
00:21:05,983 --> 00:21:08,098
我觉得他准备好了自己会说的
'cause I figured he could tell me when he's ready.

570
00:21:08,924 --> 00:21:11,714
目前 我就专心享受和基友及其看节目
For now, I just enjoyed watching the show with my friend.

571
00:21:12,892 --> 00:21:14,567
以上就是全部的经过了
And that's pretty much it.

572
00:21:15,781 --> 00:21:18,640
我一点都不想知道以上这些信息
I literally didn't need any of that information.

573
00:21:19,128 --> 00:21:21,405
一点不关心你们中任何一个
None of it. From any of you.

574
00:21:21,974 --> 00:21:23,588
我让你们过来只是因为我想了解
You're all here because I wanna know

575
00:21:23,607 --> 00:21:25,452
丹尼尔的姨妈发生过什么
what happened to Daniel's aunt.

576
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,567
Agnes Whipple现在在哪儿?
Now where is Agnes Whipple?

577
00:21:27,855 --> 00:21:29,645
丹尼尔送她回了养老院
Daniel took her back to the nursing home,

578
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:30,896
然后我们就没见过她了
and that's the last time we saw her.

579
00:21:31,016 --> 00:21:32,435
她现在不在那里
Well, she's not there now.

580
00:21:32,692 --> 00:21:34,019
Agnes Whipple失踪了
Agnes Whipple is missing.

581
00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:37,097
你们这群畜生把她藏哪儿了?!
Where is she, you monsters?!

582
00:21:37,133 --> 00:21:39,334
这种关系不太正常啊 是吧?
That's a weird relationship, right?

583
00:21:39,369 --> 00:21:40,757
你不觉得他们走的太近了?
I mean, they're way too close.
