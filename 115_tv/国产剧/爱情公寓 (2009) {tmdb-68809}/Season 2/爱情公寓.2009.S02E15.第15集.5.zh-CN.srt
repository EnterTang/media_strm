1
00:00:00,158 --> 00:00:02,324
世间有两种人
There are two kinds of folks

2
00:00:02,324 --> 00:00:04,171
总在思考如何杀人
who sit around thinking about how to kill people:

3
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:06,032
精神病患者和侦探小说作家
psychopaths and mystery writers.

4
00:00:06,032 --> 00:00:07,805
我属于高收入的后者  我是谁
I'm the kind that pays better. Who am I?

5
00:00:07,805 --> 00:00:09,288
我是里克・卡塞尔
I'm Rick Castle.

6
00:00:09,288 --> 00:00:10,320
卡塞尔
Castle.

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,262
我浑身都散发着粗犷美  是不是
I really am ruggedly handsome, aren't I?

8
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:14,176
每位作家都离不开灵感  
Every writer needs inspiration. 

9
00:00:14,176 --> 00:00:15,478
-我的灵感已经找到了  -凯特・贝克特探长
- And I found mine. - Detective Kate Beckett.

10
00:00:15,478 --> 00:00:16,621
贝克特
Beckett.

11
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:18,596
-妮基・希特  -那个角色是以你为原型
- Nikki Heat? - The character he's basing on you.

12
00:00:18,596 --> 00:00:20,339
很庆幸我和市长是朋友
And thanks to my friendship with the mayor,

13
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:21,552
她办案我能跟着
I get to be on her case.

14
00:00:21,552 --> 00:00:23,391
要是你能打我  我会很开心
I would be happy to let you spank me.

15
00:00:23,391 --> 00:00:24,419
我们一起抓过凶手
And together, we catch killers.

16
00:00:24,419 --> 00:00:26,175
我们俩可是最佳拍档
We make a pretty good team, you know?

17
00:00:26,175 --> 00:00:28,110
像是警界双雄[电影]  福星福将[电影]
Like Starsky and Hutch. Turner and Hooch.

18
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,006
你跟呼哧[福星福将的福星狗]挺像
You do remind me a little of Hooch.

19
00:00:49,637 --> 00:00:51,204
告诉我  小先知
Tell me, seer.

20
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,808
我手里拿的是什么
What do I hold in my hand now?

21
00:00:56,311 --> 00:00:58,245
你拿着
You're holding...

22
00:01:00,014 --> 00:01:01,448
钱包
A wallet.

23
00:01:01,482 --> 00:01:04,384
真令人难以置信  十猜全中
Yes! Incredible. Ten out of ten.

24
00:01:04,419 --> 00:01:05,919
这又是玩哪出
What's going on?

25
00:01:05,954 --> 00:01:08,126
奶奶在教我读心术
Gram's teaching me how to read minds. 

26
00:01:08,127 --> 00:01:09,556
她可是天赋过人
And she is a natural.

27
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,543
你这个年纪时可比她差远了
Much better than you were at her age. 

28
00:01:11,544 --> 00:01:12,726
我真是感到骄傲
And I'm very proud.

29
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,162
为什么突然对灵异有了兴趣
Why the sudden foray into the mysterious realms?

30
00:01:15,196 --> 00:01:17,898
家族研究课题的作业  一半的任务
It's a genealogy project for school. Half of the assignment

31
00:01:17,932 --> 00:01:19,866
是从家庭成员身上收集故事
is to collect stories from family members.

32
00:01:19,901 --> 00:01:21,835
我居然不知道奶奶的朋友
I had no idea that gram's folks

33
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:23,381
曾在《康尼岛》中扮演灵异人士
had a mind-reading act on "Coney Island".

34
00:01:23,382 --> 00:01:25,846
他们在风头正劲时可红了
Yeah, they were very famous in their day.

35
00:01:25,846 --> 00:01:27,273
我超喜欢他们的暗语  
I love all their codes-- 

36
00:01:27,273 --> 00:01:28,820
问题中有"告诉我"就表示拿着钱包
How "tell me" means wallet

37
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,456
"透露给我"就表示拿着一对玻璃杯
and "reveal to me" means a pair of glasses.

38
00:01:31,456 --> 00:01:32,679
你秉承的家学渊源  包括你老爸我
Yes, you come from a long line

39
00:01:32,714 --> 00:01:34,981
都是跑江湖卖狗皮膏药的
of hucksters and charlatans, myself included.

40
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:36,616
但是我们对你还是寄予厚望的
But we have high hopes for you.

41
00:01:38,653 --> 00:01:40,620
一定是贝克特打来的
That must be Beckett.

42
00:01:40,655 --> 00:01:42,289
你怎么知道的
How did you know?

43
00:01:42,323 --> 00:01:45,225
工作日的晚上  现在是十点多了
It's after 10:00 on a weekday.

44
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:47,160
还会有谁打给你
Who else is it gonna be?

45
00:01:47,195 --> 00:01:48,749
她可真有两下子
Oh, she is good. 

46
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,030
非常棒
Brilliant.

47
00:01:50,064 --> 00:01:51,565
我是卡塞尔
Castle.

48
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:53,367
就知道是你打来的
I knew it was you.

49
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:56,123
被害人是拉美裔男性  35岁左右
Victim is a hispanic male, mid-30s.

50
00:01:56,123 --> 00:01:59,144
十点半  附近住户溜狗时  发现了尸体
A local spotted him when he was out walking s dog at 10:30.

51
00:01:59,257 --> 00:02:01,729
钱包不见了  如果是劫杀
His wallet's missing. If it was a robbery,

52
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:03,672
我敢赌上一周的薪水  
I bet my week's salary that 

53
00:02:03,673 --> 00:02:05,440
凶手不知道他劫的是谁
the killer didn't know who he was rolling.

54
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,031
没钱包里的证件可以确认死者身份吗
You I.D.'ed him without a wallet?

55
00:02:07,031 --> 00:02:09,649
-恐怕是的  -你认识死者吗
- Unfortunately. - You know the guy?

56
00:02:09,684 --> 00:02:12,352
每个纽约人都认识他
Everybody in New York knows the guy.

57
00:02:12,387 --> 00:02:15,081
卡尼奥・维加  棒球选手
Cano Vega, the baseball player.

58
00:02:15,081 --> 00:02:16,857
卡尼奥・维加  你肯定吗
Cano Vega? Are you sure?

59
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:18,310
在我的梦幻职业球队选秀中
He was my first-round draft pick

60
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,987
他连续三年获首轮选秀权
in my fantasy league three years running.

61
00:02:19,987 --> 00:02:24,179
31.4%的击球率  4只金手套  还有一枚
314 batting average, 4 gold gloves, and one...

62
00:02:24,499 --> 00:02:26,366
冠军戒指
Championship ring.

63
00:02:27,078 --> 00:02:29,446
有一次我差点拿到了他打出的本垒球
I almost caught one of his homers once.

64
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,481
那时他刚从古巴来到美国
He had just came to the States from Cuba,

65
00:02:31,515 --> 00:02:33,729
我爸带我们去希叶球场的露天看台
and my dad took us out to the bleachers over at Shea.

66
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:34,770
我倒不知道你是个棒球迷
I didn't know you were a baseball fan.

67
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,287
遗传自我老爸
It's genetic, on my dad's side.

68
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:39,626
我三岁时他就带我去看球  
He'been taking me to games since I was 3. 

69
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,191
我爸也是
Yeah, mine, too.

70
00:02:41,225 --> 00:02:43,093
卡塞尔  你呢
What about you, Castle?

71
00:02:43,127 --> 00:02:44,928
你爸也迷棒球吗
Your dad a baseball fan?

72
00:02:44,962 --> 00:02:45,802
无可奉告  
I really can't say. 

73
00:02:45,803 --> 00:02:47,764
世人皆知卡塞尔没爹
Castle is famously fatherless.

74
00:02:47,798 --> 00:02:49,362
-你是被领养的吗  -不是
- What, are you adopted or something? - No.

75
00:02:49,362 --> 00:02:51,601
-那你怎么  -这事儿很复杂
- Then how do you... - It's complicated.

76
00:02:51,635 --> 00:02:53,065
这事儿不复杂
It's not that complicated.

77
00:02:53,065 --> 00:02:55,249
有人用他的头来做挥棒练习
Someone used his head for batting practice.

78
00:02:55,249 --> 00:02:57,039
36盎司的棒球直击后脑
36-ounces to the back of the head.

79
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,358
从血迹来看
By the look of the spatter,

80
00:02:58,358 --> 00:03:00,409
-死者被多次击中  -死亡时间
- he was hit multiple times. - Time of death?

81
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:02,905
根据尸温  我认为他已死亡两个小时
Uh, from his temperature, I'd say two,

82
00:03:02,905 --> 00:03:04,333
最多三个小时  
maybe three hour at the most. 

83
00:03:04,334 --> 00:03:05,921
这些伤痕是怎么回事
What's with all this bruising?

84
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:07,915
死后由棒球击打造成的
Postmortem, from the balls.

85
00:03:07,915 --> 00:03:10,505
发球器在他死亡后  还运转了一段时间
Pitching arm--it ran for a while after he was dead.

86
00:03:10,505 --> 00:03:12,638
像卡尼奥・维加这样的选手 
So you'd think a guy like Cano Vega

87
00:03:12,638 --> 00:03:14,758
在自家地下室肯定有击球练习笼
would have a batting cage in his basement.

88
00:03:15,246 --> 00:03:17,785
他这么晚到西班牙裔黑人区
What would he be doing in a sketchy neighborhood

89
00:03:17,785 --> 00:03:20,393
这种穷乡僻壤来做什么
in spanish harlem at this hour of the night?

90
00:03:20,393 --> 00:03:22,688
可能是因为这是他的球场
Maybe because it's Cano Vega field.

91
00:03:22,688 --> 00:03:25,058
附近同事说这是他为社区建的
Local uniforms said that he built it for the community.

92
00:03:25,058 --> 00:03:26,616
想回馈社会
Wanted to give something back.

93
00:03:26,863 --> 00:03:28,058
那么凶手
So our killer

94
00:03:28,966 --> 00:03:30,005
在这里攻击他
hit him from here.

95
00:03:31,654 --> 00:03:33,260
凶手的鞋上沾到了血
And he got blood on his shoe.

96
00:03:33,721 --> 00:03:34,572
让鉴证组过来看看
Have C.S.U. run a sweep.

97
00:03:34,572 --> 00:03:37,221
-看看球场外是否还有血迹  -好的
- See if anything tracked outside of the field. - All right.

98
00:03:37,221 --> 00:03:40,287
看来你的身世和电影
So your dad, what is it, 

99
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:41,759
《妈妈咪呀》(三男一女)如出一辙啊
a "Mamma Mia!" thing?

100
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,872
70年代早期  性爱解放
Early '70s, free love.

101
00:03:43,872 --> 00:03:46,293
我想你老妈在那个年代一定很开放
Yeah, I'll bet your mom was kinda wild back in the day.

102
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:48,908
你真得需要闭嘴了  
You really need to stop talking now. 

103
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:49,954
不好意思  我闭嘴
Sorry. Done.

104
00:03:53,297 --> 00:03:55,170
一个大块头运动员
A big, athletic guy

105
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,499
而且还有2.5英尺长的球棒在手
is swinging a 2-1/2-foot club.

106
00:03:58,355 --> 00:03:59,799
杀他可不容易
He couldn't have been that easy to kill.

107
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:01,492
除非他完全无心防备
Unless he didn't see it coming.

108
00:04:01,707 --> 00:04:03,177
我谨代表维加的家人
On behalf of the Vega family...

109
00:04:03,212 --> 00:04:06,247
谢谢所有卡尼奥的忠实拥趸
I want to thank all of Cano loyal fans.

110
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:08,282
感谢你们的爱心与支持
For their love and support.

111
00:04:08,317 --> 00:04:10,485
在这个无比悲痛的时刻
In this time of great sadness,

112
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:13,688
请大家尊重其家人的隐私
we ask that you please respect his family's privacy.

113
00:04:13,722 --> 00:04:15,256
12年的婚姻了
12 years of marriage.

114
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,859
狗仔们只想从我这里挖边角料
All they want from me is a sound bite.

115
00:04:17,893 --> 00:04:20,695
维加太太  对于你痛失亲人我深表遗憾
I'm very sorry about your loss, Mrs. Vega.

116
00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:23,072
你知道你丈夫昨晚为什么去棒球场吗
Do you know why he'd be in the park last night?

117
00:04:23,073 --> 00:04:25,166
有时他会去那里发泄一下
Sometimes he'd go there to blow off steam,

118
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,364
但晚上从没去过

119
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:28,202
你知道他昨晚早些时候在哪里吗

他在我的俱乐部里
He was at my club.

121
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:31,973
这是贝克特探长  卡塞尔先生
Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle,

122
00:04:32,007 --> 00:04:33,541
这是汤米・泽恩  卡尼奥的老队友
Tommy Zane-- Cano's old teammate.

123
00:04:33,575 --> 00:04:34,554
哪个纽约人
Be hard to be a New Yorker 

124
00:04:34,555 --> 00:04:36,676
能不知"货运车"汤米・泽恩啊
and not know "Freight Train" Tommy Zane.

125
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,298
你们有线索吗
So you guys got any leads?

126
00:04:38,298 --> 00:04:40,055
我们正在找  泽恩先生  你说
We're looking into it. Mr. Zane, you said

127
00:04:40,055 --> 00:04:42,304
维加先生昨晚在你的俱乐部里
that Mr. Vega was at your club last night?

128
00:04:42,304 --> 00:04:43,445
我们的俱乐部才对  
Our club, actually.

129
00:04:43,446 --> 00:04:45,444
卡尼奥  我  还有几个队友的
Cano and I owned it with a couple of other players.

130
00:04:45,444 --> 00:04:46,303
你记得具体时间吗
Do you know about what time?

131
00:04:46,303 --> 00:04:49,000
大约7点来  7点半离开
Dropped by about 7:00. Left about 7:30.

132
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,887
其实我也没见到他  我陪着一个朋友
I didn't really see him. I was with a friend.

133
00:04:52,113 --> 00:04:54,264
失陪
Excuse me.

134
00:04:54,264 --> 00:04:55,608
维加太太  你知道有没有人
Mrs. Vega, do you know of anyone

135
00:04:55,608 --> 00:04:57,240
想伤害你的丈夫
who would've wanted to hurt your husband?

136
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,048
以前的情况是人人都很喜欢他
Used to be, everybody loved him,

137
00:04:59,934 --> 00:05:01,496
他在古巴移民区特别受欢迎
especially in the Cuban community.

138
00:05:01,496 --> 00:05:03,799
-是什么改变了这点  -古巴之行
- What changed? -The trip.

139
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,807
几个月前
A-a few months ago,

140
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:07,786
古巴旅游局找上了他
the Cuban Tourism Department approached him.

141
00:05:07,786 --> 00:05:10,459
希望他做古巴旅游业的代言人
They wanted Cano to be the poster boy for the New Cuba.

142
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:12,793
冒着生命危险逃离了卡斯特罗独裁的古巴
You risk your life to escape Castro's Cuba,

143
00:05:12,793 --> 00:05:14,321
为什么还要回去
why would you go back to visit?

144
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:15,432
当卡尼奥回去后
While Cano was down there,

145
00:05:15,432 --> 00:05:18,705
古巴当局对待他犹如英雄凯旋  民族英雄
the locals treated him like a hero--their hero.

146
00:05:18,705 --> 00:05:21,930
在官方宴会上  卡斯特罗去了还跟他握手
At a state dinner, Castro came over and shook his hand.

147
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:22,566
他回来后  
When he got home, 

148
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:24,265
他的朋友们说他去了就是叛徒
his friends called him a traitor for going.

149
00:05:24,265 --> 00:05:25,833
说他是菲德尔・卡斯特罗的走狗
Said he was a lapdog for Fidel.

150
00:05:26,644 --> 00:05:28,591
他建棒球场时为他喝彩的人
The same people who cheered when he built that ballpark,

151
00:05:28,591 --> 00:05:30,759
-改口让他去死  -你丈夫有受到恐吓吗
- came up and told him to go to hell. - Did he get any threats?

152
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:33,991
那是当然了  受到的恐吓数不胜数
You bet he got threats, hundreds of them,

153
00:05:34,742 --> 00:05:37,639
而且都是受阿尔弗雷多・金塔纳的唆摆
and all of them courtesy of Alfredo Quintana.

154
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,934
探长  这是鲍比・福克斯  卡尼奥的经理人  
Detective, Bobby Fox, Cano's agent. 

155
00:05:39,935 --> 00:05:40,533
很高兴见到你
Nice to meet you.

156
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:42,758
探长  可以帮忙让那些狗仔带着他们的相机
Detective, could you do something to get those jackals

157
00:05:42,758 --> 00:05:44,955
从维加太太家门前离开吗
and their cameras away from Mrs.Vega's house? 

158
00:05:44,955 --> 00:05:46,226
我想想办法
I'll see what I can do.

159
00:05:46,226 --> 00:05:47,858
-谢谢  -谁是阿尔弗雷多・金塔纳
- Thanks. - Who's Alfredo Quintana?

160
00:05:47,858 --> 00:05:50,186
他就是杀害卡尼奥・维加的凶手
He's the guy who killed Cano Vega.

161
00:05:52,604 --> 00:05:53,730
谢谢  卡洛斯
Thanks, Carlos.

162
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,121
阿尔弗雷多・金塔纳
Alfredo Quintana--

163
00:05:58,121 --> 00:06:02,079
法学博士学位  《新希望》报纸的编辑
J.D. PHD and editor of "Una nueva esperanza",

164
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:04,087
这是由他的基金会发行的报纸
a newspaper published by his foundation,

165
00:06:04,087 --> 00:06:05,655
主要受众是古巴移民社区
primarily for the Cuban community.

166
00:06:05,655 --> 00:06:07,702
这是他两周前的专栏  
This is his column from two weeks ago. 

167
00:06:07,703 --> 00:06:09,377
卡尼奥必将付出代价
"Cano Vega must pay"?

168
00:06:09,377 --> 00:06:11,880
文章写的是  维加背叛了整个古巴移民区
The article's about how Vega betrayed the Cuban community

169
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,391
他和那个曾经残杀了无数同胞的
by shaking hands with the monster

170
00:06:13,391 --> 00:06:15,327
恶魔刹子手握手了
who butchered thousands of their relatives.

171
00:06:15,327 --> 00:06:17,839
金塔纳宣称  如果维加重投
Quintana says, "If Vega is going to embrace

172
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:20,236
其曾经逃离的残酷政权的怀抱
"the brutal regime he once escaped,

173
00:06:20,236 --> 00:06:24,119
他将尽己之能唤醒维加对残暴的记忆
he would do well to be reminded of its barbarous cruelty."

174
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:26,239
听起来就是恐吓啊
Well, that sounds like a threat to me.

175
00:06:27,298 --> 00:06:28,511
我没有恐吓他
I wasn't threatening him.

176
00:06:28,511 --> 00:06:31,999
你让纽约的古巴移民区对他群起而攻之
You turned the local Cuban community against him.

177
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:33,208
在他对卡斯特罗点头致意时
He turned his back on his people

178
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,984
他就背弃了自己的手足
when he gave Castro his nod of approval.

179
00:06:34,984 --> 00:06:38,475
如果因为他的死  而要我为所写的道歉
If you want me to be sorry about what I wrote because he's dead,

180
00:06:38,475 --> 00:06:39,371
我不会的
I'm not.

181
00:06:40,061 --> 00:06:41,137
我只是写出事实
I wrote the truth.

182
00:06:41,685 --> 00:06:42,791
你确定只是写了一篇文章而已吗
Are you sure that's all you did?

183
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,190
你自己在文章中表明了心迹
You said it yourself in your editorial,

184
00:06:45,341 --> 00:06:46,286
维加必须要付出代价
Vega should pay.

185
00:06:46,846 --> 00:06:47,815
这是个言论自由的国家  不是吗
It's a free country, isn't it?

186
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:50,981
我有权表达个人观点
I'm entitled to express my opinion.

187
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:53,090
你的基金组织  古巴人联盟
Your foundation-- Cubans First--

188
00:06:53,362 --> 00:06:54,995
设在98街东段
Is on east 98th street.

189
00:06:55,965 --> 00:06:57,203
那儿离维加的陈尸地点
That's three blocks away

190
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:59,516
只有三个街区
from the field where Vega's body was found.

191
00:06:59,725 --> 00:07:01,313
你认为我和他的死有关吗
You think I had something to do with his murder?

192
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,691
是的  所谓文字的力量更胜武力
Well, the pen is mightier than the sword.

193
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:05,659
但是棒球棒也是个不错的选择
But a baseball bat can be pretty effective, too.

194
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,495
昨晚7点到10点你在哪里
Where were you last night between 7:00 and 10:00 p.M.?

195
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:10,234
我和妻子待在家里
I was at home with my wife.

196
00:07:10,643 --> 00:07:12,860
妻子们总是最好的证明人
Mm. Wives make such convenient alibis.

197
00:07:13,026 --> 00:07:14,462
还有我的儿子们
My sons were there as well...

198
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:16,999
以及我哥哥
As well as my brother.

199
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:19,014
有和你没有血缘关系的证明人吗
Do you have anyone who isn't blood related?

200
00:07:20,128 --> 00:07:21,121
比如说公证人之类
A notary, perhaps?

201
00:07:22,571 --> 00:07:24,877
卡尼奥・维加的过错是不可饶恕的
Look, what Cano Vega did is inexcusable.

202
00:07:26,921 --> 00:07:28,548
但我不是凶手
But I am not a murderer.

203
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:30,358
你确定吗  金塔纳先生
Are you sure about that, Mr. Quintana?

204
00:07:30,613 --> 00:07:33,102
是你煽动整个社区的人反对他
You incited an entire community against him.

205
00:07:34,218 --> 00:07:35,231
在我看来
So from where I'm standing,

206
00:07:35,378 --> 00:07:36,590
你可能不是那个挥棒的人
You might not have swung that bat,

207
00:07:37,712 --> 00:07:39,914
但并不表示你不是凶手
But that doesn't mean that you didn't kill him.

208
00:07:44,888 --> 00:07:45,630
怎么样
Well?

209
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,091
动机很明显  但直觉告诉我不是他
The trigger is out by, but my gut tells me it's not him.

210
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,561
我们需要搜查令
We should get a warrant, 

211
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:49,777
查查他的捐赠人
We'll run his subscribers

212
00:07:49,777 --> 00:07:50,808
看是否有人发恐吓信给死者
against any hate mail that the Vegas might have gotten.

213
00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:53,118
卡塞尔家族没人是警察吗
You sure you got no cop in the Castle family tree?

214
00:07:53,118 --> 00:07:53,783
不  我们家族的人
No, us Castles

215
00:07:53,818 --> 00:07:56,086
都是些玩小把戏的  长官 
are mostly con artists and circus folk, Sir.

216
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,322
我想总有几个局里的熟人吧
No, I think there's a little cop in there somewhere.

217
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:02,049
老实的艺术家吗
Con artists and circus people, huh?

218
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:03,268
是的  还会读心术
Yep, and mind readers.

219
00:08:03,998 --> 00:08:06,044
真的吗  说说我在想什么
Really? So tell me what I'm thinking.

220
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,089
你在想
You're thi--aah.

221
00:08:08,265 --> 00:08:09,839
你在想  
You're... You're thinking...

222
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:12,894
你懒得理我  让我闭嘴
You don't care and you want me to stop talking.

223
00:08:13,724 --> 00:08:14,718
天呐  难以置信
Oh, that's uncanny.

224
00:08:15,211 --> 00:08:16,415
-这是天生的  -贝克特
- It's in the blood. - Yo, Beckett.

225
00:08:16,585 --> 00:08:18,014
-怎么了  -鉴证小组回复说
- Yeah. - Just got back from C.S.U.

226
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:21,256
他们追踪了球场上凶手鞋底的血迹
They managed to track the blood trail from the killer's shoe

227
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,525
但是在路边就消失了
across the park. It dead-ended at the curb.

228
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,369
看来凶手开车逃跑了
So our killer was driving a car.

229
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,148
是的  而且那地方有泥巴
Yeah. The area was a little muddy,

230
00:08:27,277 --> 00:08:28,648
我们还原了轮胎的部分花纹
So we were able to pull a partial on the tire. 

231
00:08:28,648 --> 00:08:29,808
做模型了吗
Any make a model?

232
00:08:30,144 --> 00:08:31,567
比模型还好  轮胎的特征独一无二
Better. The tire marks are distinctive.

233
00:08:31,794 --> 00:08:32,931
上面有两处压力点
They've been ped in two spots.

234
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,685
去年的一起恶性伤人案件中的车
Now those same tire tracks match a car that was tagged

235
00:08:35,813 --> 00:08:37,375
车胎有相同的特征
In an aggravated assault last year.

236
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:39,361
安东・韦德也是用球棒
The assault was committed with a baseball bat

237
00:08:40,404 --> 00:08:43,362
放高利贷  勒索
By one Anton Wade. Loan sharking, blackmail.

238
00:08:43,573 --> 00:08:44,990
还有一起持致命武器斗殴
Plus assault with a deadly weapon 

239
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,408
以及两起伤击案
and two a&b's--

240
00:08:46,471 --> 00:08:48,246
-就是伤人攻击  -我知道
- Assault and battery. - I know.

241
00:08:48,751 --> 00:08:50,595
他是个十足的坏家伙
Right. The guy's one seriously bad dude.

242
00:08:51,344 --> 00:08:53,971
天呐  我突然感觉到些什么了
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, I'm sensing something here--

243
00:08:54,142 --> 00:08:56,636
这家伙可能就是凶手
That... This guy might just be our killer.

244
00:09:08,935 --> 00:09:10,369
韦德先生
Mr. Wade,

245
00:09:10,403 --> 00:09:12,371
我们知道你去过棒球场
We have you at the baseball field.

246
00:09:12,405 --> 00:09:14,373
你开车到过犯罪现场
Your car was at the crime scene,

247
00:09:14,407 --> 00:09:16,575
我可不想
Not to mention your unfortunate history

248
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:17,984
把你用球棒伤人的恶行一一列出
of hitting people with baseball bats.

249
00:09:17,984 --> 00:09:19,432
这些足够送你回监狱了
All of that's enough to send you away.

250
00:09:19,432 --> 00:09:23,386
你可以好好和我们合作  或是保持沉默
So you can play dumb or you can play ball. 

251
00:09:23,387 --> 00:09:25,248
这不是开玩笑
Pun intended.

252
00:09:26,747 --> 00:09:28,467
好吧  我到过现场  但是我没有杀他
All right, I was there, but I didn't kill him.

253
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:29,880
当时他已经死了
He was already dead.

254
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:32,554
你只是去看看尸体吗
You were just paying the corpse a visit.

255
00:09:32,961 --> 00:09:34,725
他打电话给我  让我去见他
He called and asked me to meet up with him.

256
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:38,681
当我到那里时  发现大事不妙
And when I got there, I knew how it looked.

257
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:39,746
所以我立马就走了
So I bounced the hell up outta there. 

258
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:41,626
为什么维加会打电话给你
Why would Vega call you?

259
00:09:41,823 --> 00:09:43,493
他准备还钱给我
He wanted to make a payment on his loan.

260
00:09:43,693 --> 00:09:46,882
以前都是这样的  把钱放在信封里
He always paid the same way, cash in a plain envelope.

261
00:09:47,445 --> 00:09:49,022
我看见信封在他身上  我就拿走了
I saw it on him. I took it.

262
00:09:49,688 --> 00:09:50,764
他是个百万富翁
The guy's a multimillionaire. 

263
00:09:50,765 --> 00:09:52,515
而你只不过是个放高利贷的
You're a petty loan shark.

264
00:09:52,706 --> 00:09:53,851
他为什么要向你借钱
What's he doing borrowing money from you?

265
00:09:54,562 --> 00:09:56,315
在我们这行  不说不问才能生存
In my business, you don't ask, you don't tell.

266
00:09:56,803 --> 00:09:57,657
他向你借了多少钱
How much money did he borrow?

267
00:09:59,774 --> 00:10:00,876
他是两周前找我的
He came to me a couple weeks back,

268
00:10:00,987 --> 00:10:01,859
借了20万
Needed 200 grand.

269
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,339
以我的经验看  
In my experience... 

270
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,905
如果要借那么大一笔钱的话
If you need that kind of coin,

271
00:10:05,031 --> 00:10:08,175
他肯定惹上大麻烦了
He got himself into some real bad... Trouble--

272
00:10:09,331 --> 00:10:10,922
某种杀身之祸
The kind of trouble that gets you killed.

273
00:10:11,076 --> 00:10:13,197
或者是他还不了债
Or maybe he couldn't pay your vig.

274
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,675
你给了他  当头一棒
And you pulled a little "Untouchables" De niro on his head. 

275
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,317
如果一个人欠你钱
A guy owing you money?

276
00:10:18,448 --> 00:10:20,583
杀了他可收不回钱  你可以拿他的珠宝
Killing him ain't gonna get you paid. You take his bling,

277
00:10:20,717 --> 00:10:21,917
你可以让他做牛做马 
You jack him for his ride, 

278
00:10:21,918 --> 00:10:23,117
甚至打碎他的膝盖骨
You maybe even bust his kneecaps.

279
00:10:23,318 --> 00:10:24,974
但他还了尾款
But he made his last installment.

280
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:27,917
维加信守承诺  我们两清了
Vega made his vig. We were good.

281
00:10:31,077 --> 00:10:33,822
维加的妻子根本不知道借钱的事
Vega's wife didn't know anything about the 200 grand.

282
00:10:34,075 --> 00:10:35,571
真是怪了去了
It doesn't make sense.

283
00:10:35,738 --> 00:10:37,578
以卡尼奥・维加的条件
With his assets, a guy like Cano Vega

284
00:10:37,698 --> 00:10:39,803
他可以向纽约任何一家银行贷款
could get a loan from any bank in New York city.

285
00:10:39,911 --> 00:10:42,128
他为什么要借20万的高利贷呢
So why go to a loan shark for $200,000?

286
00:10:42,243 --> 00:10:43,342
可能银行贷款太花时间
Because bank loans take time.

287
00:10:43,514 --> 00:10:45,362
放高利贷的能马上给钱
Loan sharks give it to you right away.

288
00:10:45,439 --> 00:10:46,240
可能他急需用钱
Maybe he needed the money fast. 

289
00:10:46,241 --> 00:10:47,499
或者他不想引人注目
Maybe he needed it kept quiet.

290
00:10:47,654 --> 00:10:49,938
借高利贷不需要办手续和信贷审核
Loan sharks don't require paperwork, credit checks.

291
00:10:50,053 --> 00:10:51,595
或许他不想让妻子知道 
Maybe he didn't want his wife to know. 

292
00:10:51,596 --> 00:10:52,296
维加也不想让妻子
Vega didn't want his wife

293
00:10:52,408 --> 00:10:55,286
知道他去古巴的原因
to know why he was going to Cuba either.

294
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:56,942
你认为借钱和那趟旅行有关吗
So you think his trip and the money are related?

295
00:10:56,977 --> 00:10:58,492
是的  他回来一周后
Well, a week after he gets back,

296
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,747
突然就急需20万
He suddenly needs $200,000?

297
00:11:00,747 --> 00:11:03,716
理所当然  两者是有关系的
It stands to reason that the two were connected somehow.

298
00:11:05,151 --> 00:11:07,052
我们刚搜查了韦德的公寓
We just finished a search of Wade's apartment.

299
00:11:07,087 --> 00:11:09,321
发现了部分相同的鞋印
We found a match to the partial shoe print.

300
00:11:09,356 --> 00:11:11,323
但奇怪的是
Yeah, but here's the weird thing--

301
00:11:11,358 --> 00:11:12,694
鞋底的血迹是吻合的
It tested positive for blood on the sole,

302
00:11:12,694 --> 00:11:14,547
但是鞋上的血却不吻合
But negative for blood on the rest of the shoe

303
00:11:14,801 --> 00:11:15,602
清洁剂也不相同
And negative for cleaning agents. 

304
00:11:15,603 --> 00:11:17,204
如果韦德杀了维加
If Wade killed Vega,

305
00:11:17,338 --> 00:11:18,938
他鞋子会沾满血迹
Then his shoe would've been covered in blood.

306
00:11:19,091 --> 00:11:20,295
所以韦德说的是实话
So Wade's telling the truth.

307
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:22,180
他在凶手走后出现
He shows up after the murder,

308
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,275
踩到了血迹走出公园
Tracks some blood outside of the park.

309
00:11:24,548 --> 00:11:27,970
而真正的凶手鞋面上有血迹
While the real murderer gets blood on top of his shoe

310
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,134
但几乎没有留下足迹
And leaves little or no trail behind.

311
00:11:30,321 --> 00:11:32,075
我们查查维加从古巴回来后
Let's find out why Vega comes back from Cuba

312
00:11:32,218 --> 00:11:34,567
-为什么急需那笔钱  -好的
- And suddenly needs 200 grand. - Okay.

313
00:11:35,271 --> 00:11:36,549
你想从哪着手
So where do you want to start?

314
00:11:36,747 --> 00:11:38,106
你们去查查维加的经济情况
You guys look into Vega's financials.

315
00:11:38,249 --> 00:11:39,138
看看我们遗漏了什么
See if we missed anything.

316
00:11:39,227 --> 00:11:40,734
我和卡塞尔从古巴查起
Castle and I will start with Cuba. 

317
00:11:40,735 --> 00:11:42,091
古巴  不错啊
Cuba. Good idea.

318
00:11:42,281 --> 00:11:44,499
我喝着甘蔗酒  你就裹着沙滩巾
I'll bring the mojitos. You get the beach towels.

319
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:45,952
不知道行不行  卡塞尔
Oh, I don't know, Castle.

320
00:11:46,087 --> 00:11:49,760
让我穿着泳装在烈日下暴晒吗
Me in a swimsuit under the hot, blistering sun?

321
00:11:50,723 --> 00:11:52,050
我很乐意给你擦防晒霜
I'd be happy to rub lotion on you.

322
00:11:52,228 --> 00:11:54,385
好了  我还是想些
That's okay. I was actually thinking

323
00:11:54,528 --> 00:11:55,346
比较实际的东西
of something a little bit more local...

324
00:11:57,336 --> 00:11:59,637
比如安排古巴之行的人
Like the man who arranged the entire trip to Cuba.

325
00:12:00,216 --> 00:12:01,966
鲍比・福克斯  他的经纪人
Bobby Fox, his agent. 

326
00:12:01,967 --> 00:12:02,733
不错的想法
That's a good idea.

327
00:12:04,609 --> 00:12:05,788
我还是会履行帮涂防晒霜的诺言
But the lotion offer still stands.

328
00:12:06,047 --> 00:12:06,868
不用了  谢谢
No, thank you. 

329
00:12:06,869 --> 00:12:07,925
我的手可是很巧的
I have very soft hands.

330
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:13,308
什么才是职业运动
What is it with professional sports?

331
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,606
我是说  连经纪人都注射类固醇
I mean, even the agencies are on steroids.

332
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:16,983
福克斯的手上
Fox's client list

333
00:12:16,983 --> 00:12:18,828
可都是名副其实的超级体育明星
is a veritable who's who of star athletes.

334
00:12:18,828 --> 00:12:21,110
每笔合同和薪水都抽百分之五
5% of their endorsements and salaries--

335
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:23,334
他买得起半个曼哈顿区
You could pay for half of lower Manhattan.

336
00:12:23,537 --> 00:12:25,093
你刚用了"名副其实"这个词吗
Did you just use the word "Veritable"? 

337
00:12:25,094 --> 00:12:25,538
是的
Yes, I did.

338
00:12:26,394 --> 00:12:26,756
很性感嘛
Sexy. 

339
00:12:26,757 --> 00:12:28,206
你该听听我说"荒谬至极"
You should hear me say "Fallacious."

340
00:12:28,435 --> 00:12:29,661
鲍比・福克斯经纪公司 
Bobby Fox agency. 

341
00:12:29,662 --> 00:12:30,642
请稍等  有什么能效劳吗
Please hold. Can I help you?

342
00:12:30,832 --> 00:12:33,296
-我要见福克斯先生  -你有预约吗
- I need to see Mr. Fox. - Do you have an appointment?

343
00:12:33,507 --> 00:12:37,035
-我想他能挤出时间的  -是里克吗
- I think he can squeeze me in. - Rick?

344
00:12:37,205 --> 00:12:39,652
-里克・卡塞尔  -你好  队长
- Rick Castle? - Hey, skipper.

345
00:12:39,948 --> 00:12:41,703
自从上次大行动之后都没见过你
I have not seen you since the big move.

346
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:44,230
-最近怎么样  乔  -糟糕极了
- How are you, Joe? - Pretty awful.

347
00:12:44,761 --> 00:12:46,354
真不敢相信维加走了
I just can't believe this whole Vega thing. 

348
00:12:46,355 --> 00:12:47,019
我理解
I know.

349
00:12:47,243 --> 00:12:49,369
令人悲伤啊  你们又是好友  我很抱歉
It's sad. And you two were friends. I'm--I'm sorry.

350
00:12:49,631 --> 00:12:50,698
是啊  他是个伟大的小伙
Yeah, he was a great kid.

351
00:12:50,961 --> 00:12:54,567
他本可成为古巴裔罗伯托・克里米提[拉美裔传奇球员]
Uh, he had the ability to be a Cuban Roberto Clemente.

352
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:55,679
真是让人心痛
It's just been very sad.

353
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:57,316
我们来就是想和福克斯先生谈谈
We're actually here to talk to Mr. Fox about it.

354
00:12:57,316 --> 00:12:59,807
-这是凯特・贝克特探长  -你好
- This is detective Kate Beckett. - Hi.

355
00:12:59,807 --> 00:13:02,752
贝克特  凯特  探长
Beckett... Kate... Detective.

356
00:13:02,964 --> 00:13:03,368
谢谢
Thank you.

357
00:13:03,403 --> 00:13:05,838
很高兴认识你
Very nice meeting you. Okay.

358
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:07,706
祝你们好运
Well, good luck on the case.

359
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,775
我也会帮你们祈祷的
And, uh, I'll say a prayer for you guys.

360
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:11,443
谢了
Thanks.

361
00:13:11,478 --> 00:13:15,180
别忘了  代我跟你母亲问好
By the way, say hi to your mom for me, okay?

362
00:13:15,215 --> 00:13:17,282
-我会的  乔  -好的
- Will do, Joe.  - Okay.

363
00:13:17,317 --> 00:13:18,984
保持冷静
Smooth.

364
00:13:19,018 --> 00:13:21,653
那个竟然是乔・托利
That was Joe-freakin'-Torre.

365
00:13:21,688 --> 00:13:23,100
我得马上告诉老爸
I gotta call my dad.

366
00:13:23,355 --> 00:13:24,669
办公室在  
The office is over...

367
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,983
办公室应该在
The off--his office is...

368
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:28,894
卡尼奥是个好人
He was a good guy--Cano.

369
00:13:28,906 --> 00:13:31,775
他建球场是为了回馈社会
He built that field because he wanted to give back.

370
00:13:32,484 --> 00:13:34,485
也正因此才会去古巴
I think that's why he went to cuba.

371
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,960
他想证明自己能造福社会
He wanted to see if he could do something good.

372
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,612
不过我想现实总是事与愿违
But I guess things hadn't changed as much as he had hoped for.

373
00:13:39,613 --> 00:13:40,342
发生了什么
What happened?

374
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:42,394
他在哈瓦那待了一段时间
He had spent some time in Havana with the people.

375
00:13:42,549 --> 00:13:45,654
回来时心烦意乱  还告诉我
He came back pretty upset, and he told me

376
00:13:45,813 --> 00:13:48,645
让我把签约金退给古巴旅游局
To give the tourism guys back their signing bonus.

377
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,198
那可是我第一次让客人退款
First time I ever let a client give money back.

378
00:13:51,311 --> 00:13:53,547
后来我明白了
But I figured, you know,

379
00:13:53,547 --> 00:13:56,859
卡尼奥反对军事独裁
Cano was reneging on a military dictatorship.

380
00:13:56,859 --> 00:13:59,493
但你可不想惹毛这群人
These are not the people you want angry at you,

381
00:14:00,024 --> 00:14:02,452
尤其是已经在18年前成功出逃了
Especially having defected from them 18 years ago.

382
00:14:02,452 --> 00:14:04,867
他曾冒着生命危险逃跑
He risked his life to leave.

383
00:14:04,867 --> 00:14:07,664
你为何又想让他成为新古巴的代言人
Why would you want him to be the poster boy for the new cuba?

384
00:14:07,664 --> 00:14:10,980
我没有  是他自己想回去
Oh, I didn't. I was just as surprised as anyone

385
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,000
我和其他人一样惊讶
That he wanted to do it.

386
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,272
还是我千辛万苦把他带出来
After everything I did to get him out back then?

387
00:14:14,272 --> 00:14:16,462
-你听说了吗  -没有
- Have you heard this story? - No.

388
00:14:16,462 --> 00:14:18,216
你会喜欢这个故事的  卡塞尔  
You're gonna like this, Castle.

389
00:14:18,217 --> 00:14:19,094
就像你的推理小说
It's like one of your books.

390
00:14:19,094 --> 00:14:20,751
92年奥运会时
It was the '92 olympics.

391
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,719
古巴在巴塞罗那拿了金牌
The Cubans had just won gold in Barcelona,

392
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,429
都是卡尼奥的功劳
Thanks mostly to Cano.

393
00:14:25,857 --> 00:14:28,381
所以我想让他到美国来
And I wanted to get him to the states

394
00:14:28,381 --> 00:14:30,306
在大联盟里打球
To play in the bigs.

395
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,303
说服他并不难
Now convincing him was the easy part.

396
00:14:32,482 --> 00:14:36,088
难就难在让他登上我的飞机
Getting him onto my plane, that was the hard part.

397
00:14:36,088 --> 00:14:39,911
躲过教练和保镖的视线  终于
We had to get past coaches and minders and finally...

398
00:14:42,027 --> 00:14:43,197
碰到了大章鱼[古巴语]
El pulpo,

399
00:14:43,409 --> 00:14:44,409
那个国土安全局局长
Head of state security,

400
00:14:45,353 --> 00:14:48,407
他的触须控制着所有人
Because he had his tentacles around everybody.

401
00:14:48,673 --> 00:14:51,401
我们还以为能顺利回国  突然
And just as we thought we were home free--boom!

402
00:14:52,675 --> 00:14:53,587
遇到了大章鱼
El pulpo.

403
00:14:53,757 --> 00:14:55,323
我们被抓住了  糟透了
We were caught, sunk.

404
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,417
绝不是开玩笑  当时有支死刑行刑队
A firing squad, I kid you not,

405
00:14:57,604 --> 00:14:59,152
就在哈瓦那等着卡尼奥回去受刑
Was waiting for that kid back in Havana.

406
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,644
知道怎样解决大章鱼的吗
You know how I got us past el pulpo?

407
00:15:02,931 --> 00:15:04,121
劳力士
Rolex.

408
00:15:06,212 --> 00:15:07,995
我把金灿灿的全新劳力士手表给了他
I gave him my shiny new rolex,

409
00:15:09,601 --> 00:15:10,763
他就把头转到一边去了
And he just looked the other way.

410
00:15:12,547 --> 00:15:13,147
这就说明
just goes to show you,

411
00:15:13,147 --> 00:15:16,113
社会主义只是资本主义的伪装罢了
Every socialist is a capitalist when backs are turned.

412
00:15:16,655 --> 00:15:19,401
他接受那份工作会是因为急需用钱吗
Is it possible that he took the Cuba job because he needed the ney?

413
00:15:19,402 --> 00:15:20,744
有这个可能
Well, it's possible, yes.

414
00:15:20,744 --> 00:15:23,311
天知道这些人是怎么挥霍的
God knows those guys know how to blow through money.

415
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:26,335
而且  他和汤米的那家俱乐部
and plus, he has that club with Tommy

416
00:15:26,335 --> 00:15:27,600
根本就是赔本买卖
That's just a money pit.

417
00:15:27,601 --> 00:15:29,624
古巴那边的工作安排
So in regards to the Cuba job,

418
00:15:29,624 --> 00:15:31,246
还有谁和他同行
Who else went on this trip?

419
00:15:31,246 --> 00:15:33,576
有一些低级别的古巴外交人员
Well, a couple of low-level Cuban diplomats.

420
00:15:33,576 --> 00:15:35,789
我让辛西娅给你张名单
I'll have, uh, Cynthia get you a list.

421
00:15:36,494 --> 00:15:38,110
到底他为什么要去古巴
So what made him go to cuba

422
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,315
又是什么改变了他的主意
And then what made him change his mind?

423
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:43,058
可能维加为国土安全部工作
Well, maybe Vega worked for the state department.

424
00:15:43,058 --> 00:15:45,784
被派去那里  在和菲德尔・卡斯特罗握手时
Maybe he was sent to shake hands with Fidel

425
00:15:45,784 --> 00:15:48,995
暗中将生物毒素注入他体内
In a secret attempt to release a biotoxin into his system.

426
00:15:49,988 --> 00:15:52,388
俄罗斯人就用放射钋喷射日本寿司
Well, the russians sprayed sushi with radioactive polonium.

427
00:15:52,388 --> 00:15:54,205
还有什么更不靠谱的呢
What-- what's more farfetched?

428
00:15:55,182 --> 00:15:57,459
我都见到了乔・托利  没什么不可能的
Well, I just met Joe Torre, so I guess anything's possible.

429
00:15:59,398 --> 00:16:04,680
贝克特  和预期一样  死因是脑出血
Beckett. Cause of death was cerebral hemorrhaging, as expected.

430
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,614
根据击打的角度推算
Any way to estimate the height of the attacker

431
00:16:06,648 --> 00:16:08,922
-有办法推断凶手的身高吗  -通常可以
- Based on the angle of the blows? - Normally, yes,

432
00:16:08,922 --> 00:16:11,548
但是本案中  凶手第一次的击打部位
But I-in this case, your attacker's first swing

433
00:16:11,548 --> 00:16:14,403
-在头部以下的位置  -有多下面
- Landed a little south of his head. - How far south?

434
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:16,848
足以让他变性的部位
E-enough to make him a soprano.

435
00:16:17,486 --> 00:16:20,093
该给他颁个精准奖杯
Ow. Shoulda worn a cup.

436
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:24,147
膝盖骨的撕裂伤表明  维加头部受击打时
Lacerations around the patella suggest Mr. Vega was on his knees

437
00:16:24,147 --> 00:16:25,284
是跪在地上的
When he was hit on the head.

438
00:16:25,688 --> 00:16:27,539
这么说凶手可以是任何人
So our attacker could've been anyone?

439
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,148
男性  女性甚至是儿童
Man, woman or child.

440
00:16:30,345 --> 00:16:31,484
但这不是我叫你们来的原因
But that's not why I called.

441
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,285
在所有新的伤痕中
Among all the fresh bruising,

442
00:16:34,216 --> 00:16:37,219
我发现有几处严重的皮下瘀伤
We also found significant subdermal bruises

443
00:16:37,219 --> 00:16:39,268
这些都不是新伤
That weren't quite as fresh.

444
00:16:40,072 --> 00:16:42,583
伤痕都有拳头大小
The contusions were all fist sized.

445
00:16:43,882 --> 00:16:44,740
他跟人打过架
He was in a fight.

446
00:16:45,131 --> 00:16:45,890
遇害的前几天
Couple days ago.

447
00:16:46,603 --> 00:16:48,072
这个是什么东西的形状
What's this shape right here?

448
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,590
打他的人带着戒指
He was wearing a ring.

449
00:16:49,624 --> 00:16:52,393
不是普通戒指
Not just any ring.

450
00:16:52,427 --> 00:16:54,095
是枚总冠军戒指
A championship ring.

451
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:54,965
左手无名指
Left-hand ring finger,

452
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:59,133
正像他的前队友汤米・泽恩
Just like his old teammate, free train Tommy Zane.

453
00:17:02,748 --> 00:17:04,683
妈妈一家的家谱能追溯五月花号时代
You know, mom's family goes all the way back to the "Mayflower."

454
00:17:04,717 --> 00:17:06,873
她的被害妄想症是遗传的吗
What, her persecution complex is genetic?

455
00:17:06,873 --> 00:17:09,075
我也遗传了她的基因
Hey, those are my genes you're talking about,too.

456
00:17:09,075 --> 00:17:10,875
从好的方面来看
 Well, look on the bright side.

457
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:12,998
现在你知道自己遗传了这一倾向
Now that you know you're genetically predisposed,

458
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:16,960
你可以尽早治疗  以防以后发作
You can seek early treatment, prevent future outbreaks.

459
00:17:17,855 --> 00:17:18,986
你不觉得困扰吗
Doesn't it bother you

460
00:17:19,763 --> 00:17:22,015
不知道自己的父亲是谁  
That you don't know who your dad is? 

461
00:17:22,016 --> 00:17:22,362
不困扰
No.

462
00:17:23,206 --> 00:17:24,059
为什么这么问  你觉得困扰吗
Why, does it bother you?

463
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:26,465
是这样的  这个族谱
It's like... I have this family tree,

464
00:17:26,677 --> 00:17:28,402
有一大块是缺失的
And there's a whole chunk of it missing.

465
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:30,775
我的历史有很长一段根本不曾存在
There's a whole part of my history that doesn't even exist.

466
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,093
奶奶怎么可能不知道
I mean, really, how could gram not know?

467
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:36,687
我大一时  一次去参加派对
My first year of college, I, uh, went to a party,

468
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:38,262
遇见一个叫艾莉森的女孩
Met this girl--Allison.

469
00:17:38,889 --> 00:17:40,242
在短暂的六小时里  
In the space of six hours, 

470
00:17:40,243 --> 00:17:41,867
我们相识  相知  共舞
we met, we talked, we danced,

471
00:17:42,091 --> 00:17:43,035
我们坠入爱河
We fell in love.

472
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:45,112
但是第二天早上  她消失了
The next morning, she was gone.

473
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,543
我花了整整一年的时间寻找她
I spent a year trying to find her,

474
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:49,081
我甚至都不知道她姓什么
But I never learned her last name.

475
00:17:49,338 --> 00:17:51,617
那时我没有一天不想念她
There's not a week that goes by I don't think about her.

476
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:54,873
你奶奶告诉我在遇见他的那晚
Your gram told me that she loved a lifetime

477
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,321
她倾注了此生所有的爱
The night she met him.

478
00:17:56,574 --> 00:17:58,821
但是不知道他是谁  你不觉得遗憾吗
Don't you feel like you're missing out, not knowing?

479
00:17:58,821 --> 00:18:02,072
不  不  这就是神秘的美感
No. Oh, no. That's the beauty of the mystery.

480
00:18:02,072 --> 00:18:04,759
现在我父亲可以是个宇航员
Right now, my father could be an astronaut,

481
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:08,237
海盗  慈善家  甚至是诺贝尔奖得主
A pirate, a humanitarian, winner of the nobel prize.

482
00:18:08,482 --> 00:18:10,947
有谁比得上这个想象中的父亲呢
I mean, what one man could live up to all that?

483
00:18:11,145 --> 00:18:12,673
他也会拿着罐头吃生奶油吗
You think he ate whipped cream out of a can?

484
00:18:12,852 --> 00:18:15,251
没错  因为是他发明了生奶油
Yes, and he invented whipped cream.

485
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:17,106
爸爸
Dad!

486
00:18:18,488 --> 00:18:19,496
你会吃不下晚餐的
You're gonna spoil your dinner.

487
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:21,616
-这就是我的晚餐  -不是
- This is my dinner. - No.

488
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:30,297
泽恩先生
Mr. Zane.

489
00:18:31,613 --> 00:18:33,164
贝克特探长
Detective Beckett. 

490
00:18:33,165 --> 00:18:34,272
卡塞尔先生
Mr. Castle.

491
00:18:34,556 --> 00:18:36,426
泽恩先生  您今晚兴致真好啊  
You're in a festive mood tonight, Mr. Zane.

492
00:18:36,591 --> 00:18:38,134
-在悼念亡友吗  - 庆祝美好生活
- Honoring the dead? - Celebrating a life...

493
00:18:38,379 --> 00:18:40,460
用卡尼奥喜欢的方式庆祝生活
The way Cano would've wanted it.

494
00:18:40,628 --> 00:18:43,931
没错  没什么比苹果马提尼更能表达悲伤了
Yes, nothing says "I'm grieving" like an appletini.

495
00:18:44,085 --> 00:18:46,653
泽恩先生  你肯定是个不记仇的人
You must be the "Forgive and forget" type, Mr. Zane,

496
00:18:46,831 --> 00:18:48,014
特别是几天前
Especially after that beating

497
00:18:48,145 --> 00:18:49,847
你狠狠揍了卡尼奥一顿  现在就忘了
That you gave Cano a couple of nights ago.

498
00:18:49,993 --> 00:18:50,932
你在胡说什么
What are you talking about?

499
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:53,828
维加身上有你留下的多处瘀伤
We found the bruises left on Vega's body from where you hit him,

500
00:18:53,913 --> 00:18:56,641
还包括你的总冠军戒指留下的印记 
Including the imprints left by your championship ring. 

501
00:18:56,642 --> 00:18:58,347
有25个人有这枚戒指
25 guys have this ring.

502
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:00,021
他们都把戒指戴在左手无名指吗
Do they all wear it on their left-hand ring finger?

503
00:19:00,021 --> 00:19:00,995
有几个
Some of 'em, yeah.

504
00:19:01,146 --> 00:19:02,878
他们的手上都有
Do they all have abrasions on that finger

505
00:19:03,028 --> 00:19:04,558
对得上号的瘀伤吗
That are consistent with assault?

506
00:19:04,813 --> 00:19:06,546
泽恩先生  到底发生了什么
What happened, Mr. Zane?

507
00:19:06,731 --> 00:19:08,795
卡尼奥是不是要从俱乐部撤资
Was Cano tired of dumping money into this club?

508
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,259
-他关心的不是钱  -那是什么
- He didn't care about the money.  - Then what was it?

509
00:19:14,465 --> 00:19:15,737
他妻子
His wife.

510
00:19:16,466 --> 00:19:17,560
他妻子  你和她
His wife? You and she were--

511
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,555
没有
No.

512
00:19:18,765 --> 00:19:20,422
但是他以为我们
But he thought w--

513
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,309
玛吉很不难过  她认为
Maggie was upset, said she thought Cano

514
00:19:24,446 --> 00:19:25,764
卡尼奥有婚外情  想了解清楚
Was having an affair and wanted to know

515
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:27,434
问我是否看见他和别人在此约会
If I'd seen him down here at the club with anybody.

516
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:28,375
你怎么告诉她的
What'd you tell her?

517
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,489
-我跟她说没有   -你说的是真话吗
- I told her no, of course.  - Was that the truth?

518
00:19:30,662 --> 00:19:32,345
以前也有过类似情况
Look, I've been through this before.

519
00:19:32,522 --> 00:19:34,142
卡尼奥只是逢场作戏
Cano was hing some kind of crisis.

520
00:19:34,302 --> 00:19:35,661
他是不会离开她的
He wasn't gonna leave her.

521
00:19:35,661 --> 00:19:36,884
没必要告诉她真相  
So why tell her the truth? 

522
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:38,476
这么说维加确实有婚外情
So Vega was having an affair?

523
00:19:38,476 --> 00:19:41,005
跟一个年轻古巴女孩子
I'd seen him with a girl-- young, cuban.

524
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:43,572
我是后来才发现的  他经常不回家
You know, I figured after his visit, he was missing home.

525
00:19:43,572 --> 00:19:45,088
那晚他见我从他家里出来
Anyway, he saw me leaving his house that night,

526
00:19:45,088 --> 00:19:47,527
他问玛吉为什么我在
And when he asked Maggie why I was there, 

527
00:19:47,528 --> 00:19:48,245
她言辞闪烁
she got evasive.

528
00:19:48,245 --> 00:19:51,134
自然的  他认为她也有婚外情
So naturally, he thought she was having an affair of her own.

529
00:19:51,134 --> 00:19:52,575
他来找我算帐
Came after me swinging.

530
00:19:52,575 --> 00:19:53,739
我给了他肋骨几拳
Took a couple of shots to his ribs

531
00:19:53,739 --> 00:19:56,057
让他安静下来听我解释
to calm him down enough before I could tell him the truth.

532
00:19:56,057 --> 00:19:57,410
他约会的姑娘
This girl that he was dating,

533
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,084
-还记得她的名字吗  -不  他没跟我说过
- do you remember her name? - No, he never told me her name.

534
00:20:00,563 --> 00:20:02,204
不过我手机里可能有张照片
But I might have a picture on my phone.

535
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,404
跟职业运动员和政客在一起会怎样
What is it with professional athletes and politicians

536
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,536
他们就是没法不动邪念吗
that they just can't keep it in their pants?

537
00:20:08,687 --> 00:20:11,007
只是自我感觉良好  发育过度的青少年
They're just overgrown teenagers with delicate little egos.

538
00:20:12,005 --> 00:20:13,921
没那么深奥  是简单的算术
It's not that deep. It's just simple math.

539
00:20:14,128 --> 00:20:15,109
他们有更多机会
They just have more opportunity.

540
00:20:15,954 --> 00:20:17,369
你是说  男人是狗
Well, what are you saying, men are dogs?

541
00:20:17,602 --> 00:20:21,035
不  机会越大  可能性就越大
No. The greater the opportunity, the greater the likelihood.

542
00:20:21,035 --> 00:20:22,724
意味着你们两个没什么好担心的
Which means the two of you have nothing to worry about.

543
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:24,126
莱恩没什么好担心的
Ryan has nothing to worry about.

544
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:26,420
卡尼奥・维加  另一方面...
Hey. Cano Vega, on the other hand...

545
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,574
他妻子说  他从古巴回来性情大变
His wife said that he changed when he got back from Cuba.

546
00:20:28,574 --> 00:20:31,045
或许不是因为古巴  是因为那个姑娘
Maybe it wasn't Cuba. Maybe it was the girl.

547
00:20:31,045 --> 00:20:32,433
这就能解释那二十万美元了
That could explain the 200 grand.

548
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:33,230
或许是那姑娘需要这笔钱
Maybe he needed it for the girl.

549
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,746
没有找到她  为何他要
And why he needed to borrow money from a loan shark

550
00:20:35,746 --> 00:20:38,122
-向高利贷借钱  -但玛吉・维加知道了
- without her finding out. - But Maggie Vega did find out.

551
00:20:38,728 --> 00:20:41,755
于是  她决定不再忍受
So she decides she's not gonna take it anymore.

552
00:20:41,755 --> 00:20:42,658
考虑离婚
She considers divorce,

553
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,305
可又想到没完没了的调查
But thought about the endless hours of scrutiny,

554
00:20:45,305 --> 00:20:46,851
媒体上的公开丑闻
the public humiliation in the media.

555
00:20:46,851 --> 00:20:48,200
而且她只能分到一半财产
Not to mention that she'd only get half.

556
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,714
假设没有婚前协议的话
Uh, assuming there's no prenup.

557
00:20:49,714 --> 00:20:51,767
如果她杀死了丈夫  就能得到一切
But if she kills him, she gets everything.

558
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:53,995
她知道他要去哪里
Mm-hmm. She knows where he's gonna be,

559
00:20:53,995 --> 00:20:55,852
晚上  一个人
Alone, at night.

560
00:20:56,915 --> 00:20:57,855
她去了那里
She goes there.

561
00:20:58,539 --> 00:21:00,179
他信任妻子  放松了警惕
He trusts her, lets his guard down.

562
00:21:00,482 --> 00:21:02,040
她靠近了
She moves in close.

563
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,058
微笑着  捡起棒球棍
She smiles, picks up a bat,

564
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,930
想着他对自己所做的一切
Thinks of everything that he's done to her,

565
00:21:06,051 --> 00:21:07,282
从家庭幸福开始
Starts with the family jewels

566
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:09,503
以家庭财富而告终
And ends with the family fortune.

567
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,000
胡扯八道  我为什么要谋杀亲夫
This is crazy. Why would I kill my husband?

568
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:18,819
因为你觉得他有婚外情
Because you thought he was having an affair.

569
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,621
你们知道了
You know?

570
00:21:22,194 --> 00:21:23,459
-怎么知道的  -别管我们怎么知道的
- How? - It doesn't matter how we know.

571
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,520
-重点是你没告诉我们  -这是我和卡尼奥的
- What matters is that you didn't tell us. - It was a private matter

572
00:21:26,684 --> 00:21:28,611
-个人隐私  -也是动机
- between Cano and me. - It's also motive.

573
00:21:28,758 --> 00:21:30,505
维加夫人  你丈夫遇害当晚
Mrs. Vega, where were you on the night

574
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,424
-你在哪里  -一个人在家
- of your husband's murder? - At home alone.

575
00:21:32,628 --> 00:21:34,578
如果你想  可以看监控录像
You can check the security tapes if you want.

576
00:21:34,743 --> 00:21:38,952
那么...  那是真的
So... It's true then?

577
00:21:39,627 --> 00:21:40,594
他有外遇了吗
He was seeing someone else?

578
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:42,165
我们还不能肯定
We don't know that for sure.

579
00:21:44,152 --> 00:21:45,308
我能肯定
I do.

580
00:21:48,624 --> 00:21:50,028
他爱上了这个女人
He was in love with her.

581
00:21:52,508 --> 00:21:53,750
她叫莱拉
Her name is Lara.

582
00:21:54,045 --> 00:21:55,722
米・卡利妮奥  意思是"我的至爱" 
Mi Carinio. It means "My love."

583
00:21:57,266 --> 00:21:58,714
她是谁  不知道
Who is she? I don't know.

584
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,904
为了找线索我把房子翻了个遍
I've torn this house upside down looking for a clue.

585
00:22:02,338 --> 00:22:03,654
唯一找到的就是这张字条
That note is the only thing I've found.

586
00:22:04,858 --> 00:22:07,026
2月16号  遇害的两天前
"2/16"--that's the day before the murder. 

587
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:10,249
他那天进城的  直到十点半才回家
He went into the city that day, didn't get home until 10:30.

588
00:22:11,216 --> 00:22:11,960
所以我知道
That's why I knew.

589
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,524
维加夫人  这个女人很可能涉嫌
Mrs. Vega, this woman is possibly involved

590
00:22:14,694 --> 00:22:15,667
你丈夫的谋杀
in your husband's murder.

591
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:16,792
之前为何不告诉我们
Why didn't you tell us this before?

592
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:18,869
因为我...
Because I...

593
00:22:20,253 --> 00:22:21,367
我不希望这是真的
I just didn't want it to be true.

594
00:22:23,616 --> 00:22:25,897
家庭监控录像证明了维加夫人的话
Home security videos confirm Mrs. Vega's story,

595
00:22:26,072 --> 00:22:28,585
汤米・泽恩家的血样  鉴定组测试不符
And C.S.U. Tested negative for blood at Tommy Zane's place.

596
00:22:29,827 --> 00:22:30,947
那个姑娘查得怎么样了
Where are we on the girl?

597
00:22:31,156 --> 00:22:32,901
刚搜索完维加的互联网记录
Just finished combing through Vega's internet records.

598
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:35,311
不管电邮还是网络通讯
There are no I.M.S, e-mails

599
00:22:35,311 --> 00:22:37,663
他跟莱拉没有任何形式的联系
connecting him in any way, shape or form to a Lara.

600
00:22:37,663 --> 00:22:38,735
电话调查也一无所获
Phones are a dead end, too.

601
00:22:39,008 --> 00:22:42,003
过去两个月里  他并没有
No one who called or was called by Vega in the last two months

602
00:22:42,023 --> 00:22:43,579
和某个莱拉通过电话
Remembers him mentioning anyone named Lara

603
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:45,635
这个家伙如果是恋爱了
Well, for a guy who's supposedly in love,

604
00:22:45,635 --> 00:22:47,899
跟姑娘可是没保持密切联系
He doesn't do a very good job keeping in touch with his girl.

605
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:51,123
有的人要绝望了  亲爱的
Some guys are just hopeless. Hey, honey.

606
00:22:51,756 --> 00:22:53,712
是啊  想你了  觉得该给你打个电话
Yeah, I was just thinking about you, thought I'd call you.

607
00:22:53,712 --> 00:22:55,722
只想告诉你我想你了
Well, I just wanted to call to say I miss you.

608
00:22:55,722 --> 00:22:58,066
-是啊  -有的人真可悲
- Yeah. - Some guys are just pathetic.

609
00:22:58,066 --> 00:23:01,123
别妒忌  他还是喜欢你的
Don't be jealous. He still loves you.

610
00:23:01,123 --> 00:23:02,778
维加死前一天见过她
Vega met with her the day before he died,

611
00:23:02,778 --> 00:23:04,634
把照片发到所有辖区
So let's put photos out to all precincts

612
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:07,066
让同事们详细调查球场周围的区域
And have uniforms canvass the area around the field.

613
00:23:07,066 --> 00:23:09,849
-说不定案发当晚有人见过她  -贝克特
- Maybe somebody saw her the night that he was killed. - Beckett.

614
00:23:09,849 --> 00:23:11,793
-是  长官  -古巴方面查得怎么样了
- Yes, sir. - How we doing on the Cuba angle?

615
00:23:11,793 --> 00:23:13,828
还没有进展  怎么了
Nothinyet. Why? 

616
00:23:13,828 --> 00:23:15,952
刚接到新泽西州尤尼恩市警局的电话
Just got a call from the lieu over in Union City, New Jersey.

617
00:23:15,952 --> 00:23:17,704
维加曾在小哈瓦那区的餐馆
Vega was involved in a shouting match

618
00:23:17,704 --> 00:23:20,007
跟他们的一个老主顾争吵
at a restaurant in little Havana with one of their regulars.

619
00:23:20,007 --> 00:23:21,725
然后报警叫警察来劝架
Apparently the cops were called in to break it up.

620
00:23:21,725 --> 00:23:23,259
为何没有事件报告
Why wasn't there an incident report?

621
00:23:23,259 --> 00:23:25,483
那时候警察应古巴领事馆的请求
Cops kept it quiet at the time at the request 

622
00:23:25,483 --> 00:23:26,942
-保持沉默  -因为维加
- of the Cuba consulate. -Because of Vega?

623
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,730
不  是因为跟维加争吵的人
No, because of who Vega was fighting with.

624
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:31,883
马里奥・桑切兹   驻纽约古巴大使馆负责人
Mario Sanchez--head of the Cuba consulate in New York.

625
00:23:31,883 --> 00:23:34,247
他是带维加去古巴的外交官之一
He was one of the diplomats that took Vega to Cuba.

626
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:34,978
他们吵什么
What did they fight about?

627
00:23:34,978 --> 00:23:36,883
不知道  既然他们一起去了古巴
I don't know, but seeing that they were in Cuba together,

628
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:38,449
我建议你们去查个究竟
I suggest you find out.

629
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:51,475
17号晚上  我在大使馆
On the night of the 17th, I was here at the consulate.

630
00:23:52,394 --> 00:23:53,937
你们不会以为我杀了卡尼奥・维加吧
You don't really think I killed Cano Vega, do you?

631
00:23:53,937 --> 00:23:56,598
考虑到他在古巴改变心意  无法想象
Given his change of heart in Cuba, I can't imagine

632
00:23:56,598 --> 00:23:58,111
你们俩曾是最好的朋友
that the two of you were the best of friends.

633
00:23:58,111 --> 00:23:59,304
纽约的这些古巴移民
You could say the same thing

634
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:00,926
也还不是如此
about most of the Cuban community here.

635
00:24:00,926 --> 00:24:02,963
是的  可有多少人是跟你在餐馆
Yes, but how many of them ended up dead

636
00:24:02,963 --> 00:24:04,291
争吵后以死亡告终的
After fighting with you in a restaurant?

637
00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:07,013
我在忙自己的事
I was minding my own business.

638
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:10,142
-维加才是挑起事端的人  -为什么
- Vega was the one who decided to pick a fight with me. - Why?

639
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:12,879
我负责他在古巴的行程
I was in charge of his schedule in Cuba.

640
00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:15,754
我猜他可能不喜欢被牵着鼻子走吧
I guess he didn't like to be told what to do or where to go.

641
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:17,427
听起来像是你给他拴了条链子
Sounds like you kept him on a pretty tight leash.

642
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:20,115
我们一反常态
We did a counterrevolutionary the courtesy

643
00:24:20,495 --> 00:24:21,634
礼貌的允许他进入我们的国土
of allowing him back on our soil.

644
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,249
我们可不想让他四处闲逛
We weren't about to just let him wander around.

645
00:24:24,435 --> 00:24:25,957
你比任何人都清楚
So you would know better than anyone else

646
00:24:26,129 --> 00:24:28,639
-维加旅行时做过什么  -那是我的工作
- What Vega did on his trip? - That's my job.

647
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:30,320
我们问过的每个人都说
Everyone we've spoke to about Vega

648
00:24:30,571 --> 00:24:32,309
维加从古巴回来性情大变
Says he came back from Cuba a different man.

649
00:24:33,993 --> 00:24:34,946
他在那里到底出了什么事
What happened to him down there?

650
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,007
他很激动
he was very emotional

651
00:24:38,256 --> 00:24:39,346
他在那里的所有时间
The whole time he was there--

652
00:24:40,028 --> 00:24:42,928
都在跟当地人交谈  对他们感到抱歉
Uh, talking to the locals, feeling sorry for them

653
00:24:43,173 --> 00:24:44,712
为他们的穷困和自己的富有
Because they were poor and he was rich.

654
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:46,866
事实是  他有负罪感
Truth is, he felt guilty.

655
00:24:47,351 --> 00:24:49,769
当维加回来后  借了二十万现金
When returned, he borrowed $200,000 in cash.

656
00:24:50,137 --> 00:24:50,856
有可能
Is it possible

657
00:24:51,013 --> 00:24:52,452
他想给这个岛集资
that he was trying to funnel money to the island,

658
00:24:52,635 --> 00:24:55,201
-帮助一些当地人吗  -我不知道
-Help some of the locals out, maybe? -Not on my watch.

659
00:24:55,351 --> 00:24:56,229
是啊  你无法掌控
Yeah, you can't have that.

660
00:24:57,387 --> 00:24:59,125
有钱人分享他们的财富  很像社会主义
Rich people sharing their wealth? That's like socialism.

661
00:24:59,253 --> 00:25:00,250
得了吧
Please.

662
00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:04,285
事实是正像美国人  卡尼奥・维加被惯坏了
The truth is that Cano Vega, like all Americans, was spoiled.

663
00:25:04,615 --> 00:25:06,224
当他眼前出现贫瘠时
When the poverty was before his eyes--

664
00:25:06,387 --> 00:25:07,658
是无法形容的悲惨
It's an unspeakable tragedy.

665
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,057
然而  眼不见心不烦
And then, out of sight, out of mind.

666
00:25:12,766 --> 00:25:13,897
他不知道我有所觉察
He didn't know that I was aware,

667
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,783
你们想知道
But do you want to know

668
00:25:15,907 --> 00:25:17,663
维加最关心古巴的什么事情吗
the thing that interested Vega most about Cuba?

669
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,352
一个姑娘
A girl.

670
00:25:21,842 --> 00:25:22,807
什么姑娘
What girl?

671
00:25:24,225 --> 00:25:26,155
他见过很多当地人  吻过很多孩子
He met a lot of locals, kissed a lot of babies.

672
00:25:27,057 --> 00:25:29,467
我只能假设他在岛内旅游时
I can only assume it was a pretty young thing

673
00:25:29,682 --> 00:25:30,786
遇到一个漂亮的姑娘
He met while he was touring the island.

674
00:25:31,251 --> 00:25:31,898
知道她的名字吗
Do you know her name?

675
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:33,240
莱拉
Lara.

676
00:25:34,876 --> 00:25:35,611
她名叫莱拉
Her name was Lara.

677
00:25:37,842 --> 00:25:39,716
维加在古巴爱上了一个姑娘
So Vega fell in love with a girl in Cuba.

678
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:41,451
如果你相信桑切兹说的话
If you take Sanchez's word. 

679
00:25:41,451 --> 00:25:44,779
他不可能凭空说出莱拉这名字
Well, he couldn't have just pulled the name Lara out of thin air.

680
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:46,605
根据他妻子找到的字条
According to the note that the wife found,

681
00:25:46,605 --> 00:25:49,729
维加在遇害前一晚和莱拉应该见过面
Vega and Lara were supposed to meet the night before he was murdered.

682
00:25:49,729 --> 00:25:51,120
如果她在古巴
Now how are they supposed to do that

683
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,685
-他们怎么见面  -如果她在岛上
-if she's stuck in Cuba? -If she's stuck on the island,

684
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:56,542
怎么会跟维加在俱乐部照相 
How did she end up in that photo with Vega at his club?

685
00:25:56,542 --> 00:25:59,008
肯定有个理由能解释一切
There has to be an explanation that makes this all make sense.

686
00:25:59,008 --> 00:26:03,465
有  照片里站在维加旁的不是莱拉 
There is. The woman standing next to Vega in the picture is not Lara.

687
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:06,189
维加被杀的棒球场附近  有居民认出了她
A resident near the ballpark where Vega was killed I.D.'ed her.

688
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,784
她叫阿娜  阿娜・蕾维拉
Her names Ana, Ana Rivera.

689
00:26:08,054 --> 00:26:09,567
她是社区俱乐部的服务生
She's a waitress in the neighborhood.

690
00:26:09,742 --> 00:26:11,060
同事正把她带过来
Uniforms are bringing her in now.

691
00:26:11,061 --> 00:26:12,378
她和维加有什么关系
What's her connection to Vega?

692
00:26:12,522 --> 00:26:15,118
古巴  半年前她从古巴逃来纽约
Cuba. She escaped six months ago.

693
00:26:18,223 --> 00:26:19,567
我工作的酒吧和他的球场很近
We met at a bar where I work,

694
00:26:19,568 --> 00:26:20,706
我们就在那里认识的
near his field.

695
00:26:21,612 --> 00:26:23,957
他听说我去年才从古巴过来
He heard I'd just come over from Cuba last year,

696
00:26:24,341 --> 00:26:25,508
就请我出去喝几杯
and he invited me out for drinks.

697
00:26:25,806 --> 00:26:27,042
你知道他已婚吗
Did you know he was married?

698
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,279
我们不是那种关系
It wasn'like that.

699
00:26:29,192 --> 00:26:31,567
他只想聊天  聊家乡
He just wanted to talk... about home.

700
00:26:32,256 --> 00:26:34,227
他想家  我觉得因此他才回了古巴
He missed it. I think that's why he wanted to go.

701
00:26:34,453 --> 00:26:37,253
他从古巴回来后与你合影
You were photographed with him after the trip.

702
00:26:37,443 --> 00:26:39,457
那时他也仅仅只想聊天吗
Did he still want to... just talk?

703
00:26:39,657 --> 00:26:41,596
是的  他想知道我是怎么
Yes. He wanted to talk about

704
00:26:41,597 --> 00:26:42,889
从古巴来到这里的
my trip here from Cuba.

705
00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:46,532
不是爱上我  只为知道我是怎么出境的
It was like he was obsessed. He wanted to know how I got out.

706
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,847
你对他怎么说的
And what did you tell him?

707
00:26:51,097 --> 00:26:52,738
阿娜  你对维加先生怎么说的
Ana, what did you tell Mr. Vega?

708
00:26:54,129 --> 00:26:55,425
我说我家人认识一个熟人
I said my family knew a man.

709
00:26:56,667 --> 00:26:58,479
只要你给得起钱
If--if you pay him lots of money,

710
00:26:58,656 --> 00:27:00,468
米・卡利妮奥就能带你去美国
Mi Carinio comes and takes you to America.

711
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:02,840
米・卡利妮奥是什么
Mi Carinio?

712
00:27:03,472 --> 00:27:04,358
他的船
His boat.

713
00:27:04,755 --> 00:27:05,724
人先坐船到牙买加
It takes you to Jamaica,

714
00:27:05,878 --> 00:27:07,436
然后再坐飞机到美国
and then you fly to America.

715
00:27:09,225 --> 00:27:12,170
入境一定要乘飞机  因为如果乘船
It's important that you fly, because if you come by boat,

716
00:27:12,368 --> 00:27:13,597
他们就会把你遣送回国
then they can send you back.

717
00:27:14,946 --> 00:27:17,287
这是海路陆路入境政策
That's the wet-foot, dry-foot policy. 

718
00:27:17,287 --> 00:27:19,166
维加在想办法让新女友离开古巴
Vega was looking for a way to get his new girlfriend out of Cuba.

719
00:27:20,161 --> 00:27:22,243
米・卡利妮奥  2月16日  下午八点半
"Mi Carinio ," 2/16, 8:30 p.m.

720
00:27:22,243 --> 00:27:23,667
他似乎成功了
It looks like he succeeded.

721
00:27:23,667 --> 00:27:25,837
米・卡利妮奥  2月16日到达牙买加
"Mi Carinio" to Jamaica 2/16,

722
00:27:26,015 --> 00:27:28,662
这意味着她17日到达
which means she arrived on the 17th.

723
00:27:28,827 --> 00:27:30,682
恰好是维加遇害当天 这不是巧合
That's the same day Vega died. That can't be a coincidence.

724
00:27:30,885 --> 00:27:34,236
阿娜  你告诉了维加先生如何联系
Ana, you told Mr. Vega how to get in touch

725
00:27:34,387 --> 00:27:35,641
帮你离开古巴的人吗
with the man who got you out of Cuba.

726
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,750
是的  他主编一份报纸
Yes. He runs a newspaper.

727
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,063
《新希望》报纸  在98街东段
"Una nueva esperanza," on East 98th.

728
00:27:42,574 --> 00:27:44,403
主编是阿尔弗雷多・金塔纳吗
Alfredo Quintana, the editor?

729
00:27:49,323 --> 00:27:50,872
他对我们撒谎了
He lied to us.

730
00:27:52,418 --> 00:27:55,153
一开始你们指控我谋杀维加
All right, first you accuse me of killing Vega.

731
00:27:55,188 --> 00:27:57,189
后来你们又说我在帮他
Then you're saying that I'm helping him.

732
00:27:57,223 --> 00:27:59,754
也许你们先该想到清楚明白
So maybe you guys should make up your mind.

733
00:27:59,754 --> 00:28:01,226
事实上  我们一看到你账户上
Well, actually, we made up our minds

734
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,869
那二十万就清楚明白了
once we saw the $200,000 in your bank account. 

735
00:28:03,869 --> 00:28:06,943
卡尼奥・维加向高利贷借就是这个数目
That's the exact amount Cano Vega borrowed from a loan shark.

736
00:28:06,943 --> 00:28:08,590
因为你们在做违法勾当
Since what you were doing was illegal,

737
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,238
所以他不想留下证据
he didn't want there to be any record of it.

738
00:28:10,238 --> 00:28:11,695
我不明白你在说什么
You know, I don't know what you're talking about.

739
00:28:18,586 --> 00:28:21,131
这些不是我的账户
These aren't my accounts. 

740
00:28:21,307 --> 00:28:22,296
这是基金会的账户
This is the foundation's account.

741
00:28:22,476 --> 00:28:23,403
上面甚至没有我的名字
My name isn't even on them.

742
00:28:23,877 --> 00:28:25,301
这就是你把赃款藏于其中的原因
Which is why you hid the money there,

743
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:26,533
让我们更难找到
to make it harder for us to find.

744
00:28:26,649 --> 00:28:28,348
这些是慈善捐款
These were charitable contributions.

745
00:28:28,508 --> 00:28:29,945
那个女孩在哪里
Where's the girl?

746
00:28:30,951 --> 00:28:31,960
什么女孩
What girl?

747
00:28:32,601 --> 00:28:35,178
金塔纳先生  你和你的基金会
Mr. Quintana, you and your foundation

748
00:28:35,545 --> 00:28:37,335
将面临偷运人口的指控
are facing human smuggling charges.

749
00:28:37,663 --> 00:28:40,283
你希望再加上妨碍司法公正
Do you really want me to add obstruction of justice

750
00:28:40,509 --> 00:28:42,696
援助和教唆谋杀罪吗
and aiding and abetting a murderer to that?

751
00:28:44,938 --> 00:28:46,080
你喜欢出版事业  对吧
You like the press, don't you?

752
00:28:47,438 --> 00:28:50,624
那喜欢涉嫌谋杀卡尼奥・维加吗
How are you gonna like being linked to Cano Vega's murder?

753
00:28:51,252 --> 00:28:52,586
你知道他们会怎么想吗
You know what they'll see?

754
00:28:53,718 --> 00:28:56,071
我从卡斯特罗的独裁下拯救了一个女孩
That I saved a girl from under Castro's regime.

755
00:28:56,467 --> 00:28:57,241
收费的
For a price.

756
00:28:57,242 --> 00:28:58,016
我本打算免费的
Yeah, I would've done it for free.

757
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,341
但你没有
Yeah, but you didn't.

758
00:28:59,643 --> 00:29:01,835
你真的准备把下半生赌在
Are you really ready to stake your entire future

759
00:29:02,072 --> 00:29:03,198
某个你陌生女孩身上吗
on some girl you don't even know?

760
00:29:08,824 --> 00:29:10,048
维加给她买了一套公寓
Vega had an apartment for her.

761
00:29:12,722 --> 00:29:14,117
她一到美国我就把她带到了那里
I took her there when I got her to the mainland. 

762
00:29:14,251 --> 00:29:16,968
-在哪里  -尤尼恩市萨米特大道
- Where? - Union City, Summit Avenue.

763
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:22,919
纽约警察  纽约警察
Nypd! Nypd! Nypd! Police! Police! Police! Police! Nypd! Nypd!

764
00:29:26,442 --> 00:29:27,840
-没人  -没人
- Clear. - Clear.

765
00:29:31,718 --> 00:29:33,152
屋里似乎没人
Looks like nobody's home.

766
00:29:33,186 --> 00:29:35,568
可怜的女孩需要去宜家买点东西
This girl's in dire need of a trip to Ikea.

767
00:29:36,135 --> 00:29:37,545
这张床从未铺过
This bed hasn't even been made.

768
00:29:37,545 --> 00:29:38,844
我觉得她不住这里
I don't think she was sleeping here.

769
00:29:40,514 --> 00:29:41,551
贝克特
Beckett.

770
00:29:43,197 --> 00:29:44,024
像是泥
Looks like dirt.

771
00:29:44,927 --> 00:29:45,858
让鉴证组过来
Get C.S.U. down here.

772
00:29:49,123 --> 00:29:50,033
大家看
You guys.

773
00:29:55,136 --> 00:29:56,365
这有血迹
There's blood.

774
00:29:57,323 --> 00:29:58,082
绝对是维加的
It's definitely Vega's.

775
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:01,553
-脚印呢  -那就很难确定了
- And the footprint? - That's harder to nail down.

776
00:30:01,844 --> 00:30:02,886
泥土的成分
The composition of the dirt

777
00:30:03,066 --> 00:30:04,702
和城区各处的泥土都很相似
is pretty similar to dirt anywhere in the city.

778
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:06,758
所以不能证明她在现场吗
So we can't actually prove that she was at the scene? 

779
00:30:06,758 --> 00:30:07,683
我只是说很难确定
I just said it's harder.

780
00:30:08,492 --> 00:30:10,669
但泥土里含有微量二氧化钛
But there were traces of titanium dioxide in the dirt.

781
00:30:10,669 --> 00:30:14,143
-粉笔  -在棒球场上用来画线的
- Chalk. - Like what they use to trace lines on baseball fields.

782
00:30:14,143 --> 00:30:15,952
所以她去了棒球场
So she heads to the field,

783
00:30:16,196 --> 00:30:17,945
用球棒打了维加的头
takes a little batting practice on Vega's head,

784
00:30:18,135 --> 00:30:20,146
回家  收拾东西  然后逃走了
heads home, packs her things, hits the road.

785
00:30:20,284 --> 00:30:22,528
给词组"击跑配合战术"下了新的定义
Giving a whole new meaning to the term "hit-and-run."

786
00:30:22,765 --> 00:30:25,444
贝克特  贝克特
Beckett. B-e-c-k-e double-t.

787
00:30:25,444 --> 00:30:27,570
编号41319
Badge 4-1-3-1-9.

788
00:30:27,871 --> 00:30:29,089
我需要交通安全管理局拦截
I need a T.S.A. hold on 

789
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,003
一个可能潜逃的疑犯
a potential fugitive.

790
00:30:30,502 --> 00:30:31,759
好  我不会挂
Yes, I'll hold.

791
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,548
同事在发布金塔纳那给的莱拉的照片
Uniforms are circulating that picture of Lara we got from Quintana.

792
00:30:35,548 --> 00:30:37,024
张贴在她住处方圆1公里内
They're plastering it on every storefront

793
00:30:37,024 --> 00:30:37,949
所有商店中
within a mile of her place.

794
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:38,874
凶手是那个女孩吗
So it was the girl?

795
00:30:39,142 --> 00:30:40,338
证据都指向她
Evidence looks that way. 

796
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,045
我们推测她用美人计使维加帮她离开古巴
We figure she honey trapped Vega into giving her tickets out of Cuba,

797
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,450
她到这里以后
and when she got here, 

798
00:30:44,601 --> 00:30:45,527
他想要的她不能给
he wanted a little more than she was willing to give,

799
00:30:45,627 --> 00:30:46,716
祸起萧墙
and things went south from there.

800
00:30:46,837 --> 00:30:48,177
也许从头到尾古巴政府也参与其中
Maybe it was the Cuban government all along.

801
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,218
他们憎恨维加的背叛
They hated Vega for defecting.

802
00:30:50,218 --> 00:30:53,473
所以他们派出美女间谍让他坠入爱河
So they send a beautiful spy for him to fall in love with.

803
00:30:53,607 --> 00:30:56,156
计划奏效了  他把她偷渡回家
It works. He smuggles her back home,

804
00:30:56,157 --> 00:30:59,776
然后突然  他死了
and bam! He's dead.

805
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:01,177
听起来好像卡塞尔写的小说
Sounds like a Castle story.

806
00:31:02,385 --> 00:31:03,824
我会起名为《最后的列车》[电影]
I'll call it "Coraz de fuego." 

807
00:31:03,825 --> 00:31:05,444
我需要拘留令
Yes. I need a detain and contain.

808
00:31:05,606 --> 00:31:07,939
禁止飞行出境协议  谢谢
All no-fly protocols. Thank you.

809
00:31:08,186 --> 00:31:10,427
我们真的应该监视领事馆
Though we really should stake out the consulate.

810
00:31:10,427 --> 00:31:11,199
我们早想到了
Way ahead of you.

811
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,260
一小时前已经开始监视领事馆
Surveillance has been there for about an hour.

812
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,202
如果她不是出于自卫而杀死他
If she killed him out of self-defense,

813
00:31:15,202 --> 00:31:16,521
她会回去找幕后黑手的
then she'd go back to the devil she knows.

814
00:31:16,521 --> 00:31:19,229
我感觉到有人在怀疑我的推测
And yet I'm sensing skepticism on my theory.

815
00:31:19,407 --> 00:31:20,729
-谢谢  -读心者
- Yeah, thanks. - Mind reader. 

816
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:21,571
你们俩都是天才
Well, you're both geniuses.

817
00:31:22,218 --> 00:31:23,282
我们的人在领事馆
That was our guys at the consulate.

818
00:31:23,456 --> 00:31:25,175
他们刚看见莱拉走进大门
They just spotted Lara walking right through the door.

819
00:31:25,494 --> 00:31:27,091
我无可奉告
I don't know what to tell you.

820
00:31:27,276 --> 00:31:28,918
我从没见过这个女孩
I've never seen that girl before. 

821
00:31:28,918 --> 00:31:31,007
那你应该买视力矫正镜了
Well,then you should invest in some corrective lenses.

822
00:31:31,007 --> 00:31:34,272
我们的人看见她进来  还不到半小时
Our surveillance team saw her coming in here not half an hour ago.

823
00:31:34,272 --> 00:31:37,135
你们的人  你们现在在监视我们
Surveillance team? You're watching us now?

824
00:31:37,135 --> 00:31:38,768
仅在法律允许的范围之内
Only within the scope of the law.

825
00:31:38,768 --> 00:31:41,214
幕后看客成了被监视的人
The watcher becomes the watched.

826
00:31:42,273 --> 00:31:43,913
我很喜欢用反讽  问她吧
I'm a big fan of irony. Ask her.

827
00:31:44,561 --> 00:31:46,639
她是个要求庇护的古巴公民
She's a Cuban citizen requesting asylum.

828
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:49,336
她是谋杀案的嫌疑人
She's a suspect in a murder investigation.

829
00:31:49,336 --> 00:31:52,691
你想让我把她交给美国政府吗
And you expect me just to hand her over to the American authorities?

830
00:31:52,732 --> 00:31:55,167
桑切兹先生  我相信你很清楚
Mr. Sanchez, as I'm sure you're well aware,

831
00:31:55,341 --> 00:31:57,263
一个国家的领事和大使馆
a country's consulate and its embassy

832
00:31:57,391 --> 00:31:59,623
享有不同的权力
have a different set of rights and privileges.

833
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,311
这只是领事馆
This is only a consulate.

834
00:32:02,185 --> 00:32:03,444
你并不享有外交豁免权
You do not have diplomatic immunity.

835
00:32:07,691 --> 00:32:08,505
现在就交出那个姑娘
Produce the girl now,

836
00:32:08,748 --> 00:32:11,043
否则我将取得搜查令  并向公众公开
or I will get a search warrant and make a public spectacle

837
00:32:11,218 --> 00:32:14,002
贵国政府在美国国土私藏嫌犯
of your government harboring a criminal on American soil.

838
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:37,943
不  他不是我杀的
No, I-I-I did not kill him. Please. 

839
00:32:37,977 --> 00:32:40,242
-你们相信我  -那你为什么要逃跑
- You have to believe. - Then why did you run?

840
00:32:40,242 --> 00:32:42,001
你为什么想回古巴
Why did you try to go back to Cuba?

841
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:45,032
我怕那个人也会杀我
I was afraid the man will kill me, too.

842
00:32:45,331 --> 00:32:47,670
-谁  -他遇害当晚来的男人
- What man? - The one who come the night he died.

843
00:32:47,878 --> 00:32:51,443
他来了...el piso[西班牙语]
He come to... El piso.

844
00:32:51,635 --> 00:32:53,200
公寓  他去了公寓
The apartment. He came to the apartment.

845
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,033
有个男人在维加遇害当晚
There was a man who came to the apartment

846
00:32:55,033 --> 00:32:57,219
去了公寓  所以你才逃跑吗
the night that Vega died, and that's why you were running?

847
00:32:57,219 --> 00:32:59,331
他杀害了我父亲
He kill my father.

848
00:33:00,386 --> 00:33:01,499
你父亲
Your father?

849
00:33:01,765 --> 00:33:02,492
维加
Vega.

850
00:33:02,793 --> 00:33:03,877
卡尼奥・维加是你父亲
Cano Vega is your father?

851
00:33:05,376 --> 00:33:06,833
莱拉  让我们从头开始
O-okay, Lara, take us from the beginning.

852
00:33:07,107 --> 00:33:08,179
从头说起[西班牙语]
Desde del principio.

853
00:33:09,043 --> 00:33:10,140
维加和我母亲...
Vega and my mother...

854
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:24,260
维加出逃前已经和她母亲订婚
Vega and her mother were engaged when he defected.

855
00:33:25,032 --> 00:33:27,090
她本应该一起来的  但却没有
She supposed to come, but she didn't.

856
00:33:27,592 --> 00:33:29,128
作为对维加叛逃的惩罚  
As punishment for what Vega did, 

857
00:33:29,129 --> 00:33:30,184
他们把她母亲送进了监狱
They threw her mother in prison.

858
00:33:32,348 --> 00:33:33,961
当时她母亲已经怀有身孕
she was pregnant with her at the time.

859
00:33:34,378 --> 00:33:35,606
维加知道这事吗
Did Vega know about this?

860
00:33:38,671 --> 00:33:40,129
直到两个月前  
Not until a couple of months ago 

861
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:41,771
他听说原来他有一个女儿
when he heard a rumor that he had a daughter.

862
00:33:41,771 --> 00:33:43,392
维加就是为这事回古巴的
Well, that's why vega went to Cuba.

863
00:33:43,709 --> 00:33:45,183
去证实他到底有没有女儿
To see if he really did have a daughter.

864
00:33:49,893 --> 00:33:50,983
他们并没见着面
They didn't actually meet

865
00:33:51,136 --> 00:33:52,407
因为古巴政府正监视着他
Because the government was watching him.

866
00:33:54,424 --> 00:33:55,569
但他收到了她的信息
But he got her a message

867
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:58,012
让他尽快救她出去
Saying that he would get her out as soon as he could.

868
00:33:58,691 --> 00:34:03,366
我第一次见我父亲是在三天前
The first time I meet my father was... three nights ago,

869
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,400
当时我就想告诉他
And I want to tell him

870
00:34:06,489 --> 00:34:08,513
他一手酿成了多少痛苦
How much suffering he caused.

871
00:34:13,997 --> 00:34:14,864
她从小到大一直认为
She grew up believing

872
00:34:15,092 --> 00:34:16,906
他父亲为了富贵荣华而抛妻弃子
That her father had abandoned her mother to get rich.

873
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:19,041
但是他却告诉她  事实并非如此
But he told her that that wasn't true...

874
00:34:20,346 --> 00:34:21,448
他之所以出走  只是因为
That he only defected

875
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,229
她母亲曾答应他一起远走高飞
Because her mother said that she was going to as well.

876
00:34:25,964 --> 00:34:27,298
但她却在最后关头改变了主意
But that she had changed her mind at the last minute.

877
00:34:28,594 --> 00:34:29,565
这些年来
All these years,

878
00:34:30,299 --> 00:34:32,221
他一直以为她已经和自己恩断义绝
He had thought that she had turned her back on him.

879
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:34,637
但却没想到
He never knew that they--

880
00:34:35,165 --> 00:34:36,886
政府利用他杀鸡儆猴
That the government had made an example of him

881
00:34:37,136 --> 00:34:38,109
震慑其他球员
To all the other players.

882
00:34:41,023 --> 00:34:42,266
他完全不知道她已死于狱中
He never knew that she had died in prison.

883
00:34:42,821 --> 00:34:43,890
我父亲...
My father...

884
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:47,211
当他从我这里得知这些时  沮丧万分
Is very upset when I tell him this.

885
00:34:47,775 --> 00:34:49,175
他说他需要和某个人谈谈
He said he need to talk to someone.

886
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:51,663
他给了我一些钱买吃的
He, uh, uh, give me money for food.

887
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:52,904
然后我就再也没见过他
I never see him again.

888
00:34:54,348 --> 00:34:57,321
你之前说  曾有个男人出现在公寓
You said earlier that there was a man at the apartment.

889
00:34:58,291 --> 00:35:01,139
当时我出去买吃的
When I go to... The market to go buy food,

890
00:35:02,514 --> 00:35:03,350
等我回来的时候
When I come back...

891
00:35:04,581 --> 00:35:07,420
我见到一个男人  出现在公寓
I see a man at the, um, um, apartment,

892
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,110
但并不是我父亲
Not my father.

893
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:12,185
我当时害怕极了  于是赶紧离开
I was so scared, so I leave.

894
00:35:13,254 --> 00:35:14,849
后来我就听说卡尼奥・维加死了
Then I hear Cano Vega is dead.

895
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:18,097
于是我躲了起来
So I run, and I hide.

896
00:35:19,257 --> 00:35:20,530
我只想回家
I just wanted to go home.

897
00:35:22,522 --> 00:35:23,385
他杀了我父亲
He killed my father.

898
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:27,033
这个出现在你公寓的男子
This man who came to your apartment...

899
00:35:28,847 --> 00:35:30,165
你能向我描述他的样子吗
Can you describe him for me?

900
00:35:31,878 --> 00:35:32,967
可以
Yes.

901
00:35:34,283 --> 00:35:35,323
咱们把话说清楚先
Let--let me get this straight.

902
00:35:36,044 --> 00:35:37,031
一个非法偷渡客
An illegal claiming to be 

903
00:35:37,032 --> 00:35:37,954
声称自己是卡尼奥・维加的女儿
Cano Vega's daughter,

904
00:35:38,707 --> 00:35:40,577
刚来到这个国家不到24小时
After being in this country for less than 24 hours,

905
00:35:41,642 --> 00:35:43,797
就辨认出一个酷似我的人
Identifies someone who kind of looks like me

906
00:35:44,237 --> 00:35:45,750
而且还是在晚上远距离看到的
From a distance at night?

907
00:35:46,605 --> 00:35:47,653
有没有搞错  二位
Well, gee, guys.

908
00:35:47,892 --> 00:35:49,946
怎么  难道我要现在就签字画押吗
What, do I--what, do I sign my confession right now

909
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:53,171
还是要先开个新闻发布会
Or after the big, uh, press conference?

910
00:35:53,668 --> 00:35:54,487
现在就开吧
Well, now's good.

911
00:35:54,838 --> 00:35:56,484
拜托  孩子们
Come on, kids.

912
00:35:57,409 --> 00:35:58,305
拜托
Come on.

913
00:35:58,581 --> 00:35:59,619
你们知道他是我朋友
You know he was my friend.

914
00:36:00,279 --> 00:36:01,673
更别提我们签了高额佣金
Not to mention, a hefty commission.

915
00:36:01,962 --> 00:36:02,630
我动机何在  
What's my motive? 

916
00:36:02,955 --> 00:36:05,083
福克斯先生  有钱人一旦出了问题
The thing about people who have a lot, Mr. Fox,

917
00:36:05,405 --> 00:36:06,617
那一定不是小事
Is that they have the most to lose.

918
00:36:07,317 --> 00:36:08,612
我相信维加得知真相时
I'm sure vega felt betrayed 

919
00:36:08,613 --> 00:36:09,476
觉得自己被出卖了
when he learned the truth.

920
00:36:10,098 --> 00:36:12,009
真相  什么真相
The truth? About what?

921
00:36:12,783 --> 00:36:14,148
那个你津津乐道的故事  
Your favorite story-- 

922
00:36:14,149 --> 00:36:15,786
1992年  巴塞罗那奥运会
Barcelona, 1992.

923
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:16,939
只是你跳过了那部分
Only you left out the part 

924
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,976
关于你是如何谎称
Where you lied to Cano Vega

925
00:36:19,155 --> 00:36:20,670
帮卡尼奥・维加的未婚妻逃走的
About helping his fiance defect.

926
00:36:21,164 --> 00:36:22,782
她临时变卦  这又不是我的错
It's not my fault that she changed her mind,

927
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:25,830
实际上  你没办法带她离开
Truth is, you couldn't get her off the island.

928
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:27,547
同时  你也知道他宁愿留在那里陪她
But you did know that he'd rather be there with her

929
00:36:27,709 --> 00:36:29,599
也不愿在大满贯赛里帮你赚个盆满钵满
Than here making big bucks for you in the majors.

930
00:36:29,931 --> 00:36:32,491
于是你让他以为她变心了
So you let him believe that she had changed her mind.

931
00:36:32,737 --> 00:36:35,226
同时为了确保他再也无从得知真相
And to keep him from ever finding out the truth,

932
00:36:35,551 --> 00:36:36,346
你把她关了起来
You had her put away.

933
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:40,284
关起来  还是在古巴  拜托
Put away? In Cuba? Oh, come on.

934
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:43,218
我的确有很多门路
I-I have a lot of pull,

935
00:36:43,497 --> 00:36:45,772
但是  要想在军事独裁国家说上话
But, uh, influencing a military dictatorship

936
00:36:45,772 --> 00:36:48,835
并不像在马戏团餐厅[名店]订位那么容易
Isn't as easy as getting a dinner reservation at le cirque.

937
00:36:48,835 --> 00:36:50,368
但你确实做到了
You'd influenced their people before.

938
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,681
玛纽埃・古铁兹  花名大章鱼
Manuel gutierrez, A.K.A. El pulpo--

939
00:36:53,681 --> 00:36:54,833
那个大墨鱼
The octopus.

940
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:56,803
你带着古巴国家队的明星球员跑了
You walked away with the star player

941
00:36:56,803 --> 00:36:59,235
而代价只是一块劳力士
Of the cuban national team for a rolex.

942
00:36:59,235 --> 00:37:00,886
我们调查过了
We did a little research.

943
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:04,215
在她的审讯中  他是主要目击证人
He was the chief witness at her trial.

944
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:05,860
指控维加未婚妻
Was denouncing Vega's fiance

945
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,538
也是你和大章鱼计划的一部分吧
Always a part of your plan with el pulpo

946
00:37:07,538 --> 00:37:09,148
还是你得为此额外付费
Or did you have to pay extra for that?

947
00:37:09,148 --> 00:37:10,764
我听说你很擅长和杀手讨价还价
I've heard you're a killer negotiator.

948
00:37:11,321 --> 00:37:14,275
你们不会是认真的吧
You can't possibly be serious.

949
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:15,491
当维加发现了一切之后
When vega figured out what you had done,

950
00:37:15,491 --> 00:37:17,988
他在俱乐部打电话给你约你见面
He called you from his club and told you to meet him.

951
00:37:18,561 --> 00:37:21,124
我猜他跟踪了你并且威胁要毁了你
I think he came after you and threatened to destroy you

952
00:37:21,124 --> 00:37:22,490
因此你杀了他  
And that's why you killed him. 

953
00:37:23,569 --> 00:37:24,540
这故事太蹩脚了  孩子们
It's a hell of a story, kids.

954
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,846
我雇大章鱼害死我球员的女人
I paid el pulpo to take care of my player's girl

955
00:37:27,492 --> 00:37:28,698
而且还是在古巴政府
When the Cuban government 

956
00:37:28,699 --> 00:37:29,770
眼皮底下顶风作案
is sending away people every day?

957
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,427
这算个什么说法
That's a hell of a tale.

958
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,924
这根本是在凭空臆断
It's pure conjecture.

959
00:37:33,924 --> 00:37:35,155
你想要真凭实据吗
You know what's not conjecture?

960
00:37:35,881 --> 00:37:37,853
我们在你的汽车驾驶座
The blood that we found 

961
00:37:37,854 --> 00:37:39,607
脚垫上发现了血迹
On the driver's side floor mat in your car.

962
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:41,946
属于维加
That was vega's blood. 

963
00:37:41,947 --> 00:37:43,136
尽管你小心清理过了
As much as you tried to clean

964
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:45,351
那双你谋杀维加时穿的
Those $5,000 pair of shoes you were wearing

965
00:37:45,351 --> 00:37:47,119
价值五千大洋的鞋子
While you smashed Vega's skull in,

966
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,291
你还是没弄干净
You didn't quite get all of it.

967
00:37:55,204 --> 00:37:56,743
辛西娅  通知我的律师
Hello, Cynthia. Call my lawyer.

968
00:37:57,994 --> 00:37:59,005
你跟他说  我会支付他一笔
You tell him he's about to earn

969
00:37:59,186 --> 00:38:01,110
前所未有的天价律师费
The outrageous, obscene amounts of money I pay him.

970
00:38:05,034 --> 00:38:05,818
转过身去
Turn around.

971
00:38:06,621 --> 00:38:07,386
转身
Turn around.

972
00:38:08,696 --> 00:38:11,321
罗伯特・福克斯  你因谋杀卡尼奥・维加被捕
Robert fox, you're under arrest for the murder of Cano Vega.

973
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:15,152
莱拉以后怎么办
what's gonna happen to Lara?

974
00:38:15,604 --> 00:38:18,178
她可以继续留在美国一年   
She can stay in the states for a year and then decide 

975
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:19,833
再决定是否加入国籍
whether she wants to apply for citizenship or not.

976
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:21,309
我不敢想象她留在这里的情形
Oh, I can't imagine her staying.

977
00:38:22,378 --> 00:38:23,546
举目无亲
Her last bit of family is gone.

978
00:38:23,862 --> 00:38:26,638
她唯一认识的人已经死了
I mean, the only person that she knew here is dead.

979
00:38:28,576 --> 00:38:29,664
其实还有一个人
Well, there is one more person

980
00:38:29,945 --> 00:38:30,720
她应该见一下
That she should meet.

981
00:38:36,913 --> 00:38:38,735
你就是莱拉
So you're Lara?

982
00:38:39,821 --> 00:38:42,253
维加先生刚离开古巴  她便出生了
She was born in Cuba right after Mr. Vega defected.

983
00:38:43,249 --> 00:38:44,594
她不是他女朋友
She's not his girlfriend.

984
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:47,656
-她是他的女儿  -卡尼奥有个女儿
- She's his daughter. - Cano had a daughter?

985
00:38:48,851 --> 00:38:49,458
我父亲他
My father...

986
00:38:50,768 --> 00:38:53,088
不知道你是否愿意我留在这里
Didn't know how you would like to have me here.

987
00:38:54,027 --> 00:38:55,841
他  他有些顾虑
He, uh... He had fear

988
00:38:56,454 --> 00:38:57,753
到底该不该告诉你我的事情
To tell you about me.

989
00:39:01,495 --> 00:39:02,230
没事
It's okay.

990
00:39:09,284 --> 00:39:11,562
她说她父亲深爱着你
She says she knows her father loved you very much,

991
00:39:11,789 --> 00:39:12,919
他并不想伤害你
And he didn't want to hurt you.

992
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:23,778
她和他都希望
And that she hoped and he hoped that,

993
00:39:24,049 --> 00:39:25,028
你们可以成为一家人
Together, you could be a family.

994
00:39:36,141 --> 00:39:37,602
我家就是你家[西班牙语]
Mi casa es su casa.

995
00:39:41,215 --> 00:39:42,178
谢谢
Thank you.

996
00:39:57,273 --> 00:39:58,118
嗨  老爸
Hey, dad.

997
00:39:58,568 --> 00:40:00,387
嗨  女儿  那么晚了你干嘛呢
Hey, daughter. What are you doing up so late?

998
00:40:00,867 --> 00:40:01,769
等你  
Waiting for you. 

999
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,348
我又做错什么了
Did I do something wrong?

1000
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,615
没有
No.

1001
00:40:06,753 --> 00:40:09,129
我只是在想你之前说的关于你爸爸的事
I was just thinking about what you said about your dad,

1002
00:40:09,946 --> 00:40:11,413
他可能是任何你所希望的角色--
How he could be anything you imagine him to be--

1003
00:40:11,765 --> 00:40:13,064
宇航员  或者海盗
An astronaut or a pirate.

1004
00:40:13,735 --> 00:40:14,511
生奶油发明者  
Whipped cream inventor. 

1005
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:15,385
对  也可能是生奶油发明者
Or whipped cream inventor.

1006
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,069
但有一样他一定做不到
But there's one thing he can't be.

1007
00:40:18,864 --> 00:40:20,123
-什么  -一个父亲
- What's that? - A dad.

1008
00:40:21,268 --> 00:40:22,527
一个普通的爸爸  
Just a regular dad, 

1009
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,786
教他的儿子如何骑车
Teaching his son how to ride a bike

1010
00:40:24,056 --> 00:40:26,153
帮他写作业  或者陪他投球
Or helping him with homework or having a catch.

1011
00:40:27,865 --> 00:40:29,444
你没经历过这些  我觉得很难过
It makes me sad you didn't get to have those things.

1012
00:40:29,915 --> 00:40:32,843
既然我不曾拥有  那也就谈不上失去
Well... I can't miss what I didn't have.

1013
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,398
如果你可以拥有呢
What if you could have it?

1014
00:40:39,202 --> 00:40:40,498
你在吧台后面藏了台时光机
You have a time machine behind the kitchen counter?

1015
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:51,098
怎么说  乖儿子
What do you say, son

1016
00:40:51,271 --> 00:40:53,478
和你老爸投会儿球如何
How about a game of catch with your old man?

1017
00:40:57,835 --> 00:40:58,812
好啊  乐意奉陪
Yeah, I'd like that.

1018
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:00,419
很好
Good.

1019
00:41:14,393 --> 00:41:15,313
准备好了吗
You ready?

1020
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:16,553
没问题
Ready.
