
111
00:04:11,663 --> 00:04:12,998
and you get brunch!

112
00:04:12,998 --> 00:04:14,466
Everybody Gets brunch!

113
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:17,435
And This is where I do six hours of work behind the scenes

114
00:04:17,435 --> 00:04:19,804
to make what James says magically happen.

115
00:04:19,804 --> 00:04:21,506
Fernando? Hey, girl.

116
00:04:21,506 --> 00:04:23,074
Brunch! I need a favor.

117
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,869
So... drag Queen Billie club is telling me

118
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,838
about her new Sunday night dance party

119
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:34,174
"Twerk Baton hot dog" At tushes,

120
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:37,143
and Officer Billy wants to go, but he's po-Po!

121
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:40,347
You can't have po-Po at "Twerk Baton Hot dog"!

122
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:46,186
the most fun meal of all the meals,

123
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:47,420
and you are completely ignoring

124
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,989
your friends who came to visit you

125
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:51,825
all the way from who cares.

126
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:54,894
You're right. I guess can I take a break.

127
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,129
So, um, Crissy, Robert,

128
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,964
what are you guys doing while you're in New York?

129
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,433
"Good morning America"!

130
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,936
ah. I've done "g.M.A." What are you promoting?

131
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:05,939
I'm kidding! I know you're just people! Oh!

132
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,808
Yeah, we're gonna hold up signs outside the window

133
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,410
and get on tv.

134
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,812
Uh-Oh. Better make mine a virgin mimosa.

135
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,514
Oh! Spoiler alert!

136
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:15,815
I am pregnant!

137
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,584
That's wonderful! James is not the father!

138
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:20,186
I know. Robert's the father.

139
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:23,857
That's fantastic.

140
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:25,825
We conceived on the third night of our honeymoon. Yeah.

141
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:29,295
The first two nights, my mom was still sharing our hotel room.

142
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:30,830
Oh, my God.

143
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,932
Excuse me. Um, I haven't drank in a while.

144
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:34,401
I'm gonna go use the restroom.

145
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,075
Ohh.

146
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,277
I feel a little light-headed.

147
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:47,047
But it's okay. I'll just segue to tea

148
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:50,050
and get those files over to harkin.

149
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:02,328
You landed Yoshida.

150
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,164
But--But the Yoshida meeting isn't until Monday.

151
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:05,899
Yeah, and today's tuesday.

152
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,867
I--wh-What happened to brunch?

153
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,370
Get this crazy bitch some brunch!

154
00:06:20,226 --> 00:06:22,261
June, congrats on Yoshida!

155
00:06:22,261 --> 00:06:24,864
And I told my husband what you said on Monday, and he agreed.

156
00:06:24,864 --> 00:06:26,332
Canceled the adoption.

157
00:06:26,332 --> 00:06:30,002
Good! A lot happened on Monday, and today's--Today's tuesday.

158
00:06:30,002 --> 00:06:31,037
June, your advice yesterday worked.

159
00:06:31,037 --> 00:06:33,806
The swelling's completely gone!

160
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,276
I got it. Thanks so much, June.

161
00:06:37,276 --> 00:06:38,845
Si, se puede, right?

162
00:06:38,845 --> 00:06:40,279
Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm.

163
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:42,815
Pick up. Pick up. Pick up. Pick up. Pick up.

164
00:06:42,815 --> 00:06:43,716
Hi.

165
00:06:43,716 --> 00:06:44,884
What happened to me?

166
00:06:44,884 --> 00:06:46,619
Oh. You were blacked out for two days.

167
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:48,120
Why?! the last thing I remember

168
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,755
was being in the bathroom at brunch.

169
00:06:49,755 --> 00:06:50,923
Yeah, so immediately before that,

170
00:06:50,923 --> 00:06:52,725
I "Black lightninged" you.

171
00:06:52,725 --> 00:06:54,060
What? I put an herb

172
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,928
that I got off the internet called black lightning

173
00:06:55,928 --> 00:06:57,263
into your mimosa.

174
00:06:57,263 --> 00:06:59,198
You've been so Boring and self-obsessed lately.

175
00:06:59,198 --> 00:07:01,300
I wanted to shake you up like a snow globe.

176
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,002
What did I do while I was blacked out?

177
00:07:03,002 --> 00:07:04,203
A lot of things.

178
00:07:04,203 --> 00:07:06,005
Whee!

179
00:07:11,077 --> 00:07:12,845
Whee!

180
00:07:18,851 --> 00:07:20,820
Whee!

181
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,022
Can you believe I did that to you?

182
00:07:23,022 --> 00:07:24,690
Pretty crazy of me, right?

183
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,926
So I'm there, about to walk Yoshida through

184
00:07:26,926 --> 00:07:29,262
our conservative investment proposal,

185
00:07:29,262 --> 00:07:32,798
when you roll in, talking high-risk, high-reward...

186
00:07:32,798 --> 00:07:34,834
and you dazzled them.

187
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:36,302
They wanted safe. You called an audible.

188
00:07:36,302 --> 00:07:39,238
And, lady, that's the kind of thing that gets you promoted

189
00:07:39,238 --> 00:07:42,975
from junior analyst to senior junior analyst!

190
00:07:42,975 --> 00:07:44,176
Huh?! Ha ha!

191
00:07:44,176 --> 00:07:46,245
Thank you! Ohh.

192
00:07:46,245 --> 00:07:48,814
Just got off the phone with the adoption agency.

193
00:07:48,814 --> 00:07:50,883
Baby's canceled!

194
00:07:50,883 --> 00:07:52,852
Good luck growing up in the Ukraine, baby.

195
00:07:52,852 --> 00:07:54,887
You'll be cold, and I'll be drunk!

196
00:07:54,887 --> 00:07:56,889
Whoo!

197
00:07:56,889 --> 00:08:00,889
♪ highway to the danger zone ♪

198
00:08:05,965 --> 00:08:07,600
So loud!

199
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,170
I'm just taking a mind ride, thinking about Crissy's baby.

200
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:14,140
I mean, how could she be so sure that it's not mine?

201
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,141
Wait. I'm confused.

202
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:17,310
Do you want the baby to be yours?

203
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,878
I just think it's weird

204
00:08:18,878 --> 00:08:19,879
that with all the wild celebrity sex I've had,

205
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:21,781
I've never had a pregnancy scare.

206
00:08:21,781 --> 00:08:24,050
You haven't?  Oh, honey.

207
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,752
Even I've had a pregnancy scare.

208
00:08:26,752 --> 00:08:27,887
Yo, I just want you to know

209
00:08:27,887 --> 00:08:30,022
that I'm-a be here for you through this whole--

210
00:08:30,022 --> 00:08:31,190
It's negative!

211
00:08:33,025 --> 00:08:35,094
Oh! That was close, girl!

212
00:08:35,094 --> 00:08:37,663
Crissy can't say anything in front of her husband,

213
00:08:37,663 --> 00:08:40,600
but she says that they conceived on their honeymoon.

214
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,568
We slept together on their wedding day.

215
00:08:42,568 --> 00:08:44,070
That's pretty close.

216
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,738
Now that I think about it,

217
00:08:45,738 --> 00:08:49,738
if I had to pit your sperm against his sperm...

218
00:08:58,818 --> 00:09:00,686
I'll get a D.N.A. Test after the baby's born.

219
00:09:00,686 --> 00:09:02,622
If it's mine, I'll just Sue for sole custody.

220
00:09:02,622 --> 00:09:04,957
Don't touch that. But in the meantime,
