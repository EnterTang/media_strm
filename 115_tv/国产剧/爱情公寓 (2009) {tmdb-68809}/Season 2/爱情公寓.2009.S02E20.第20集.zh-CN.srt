1
00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:01,308
There are two kinds of folks

2
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:02,935
who sit around thinking
about how to kill people:

3
00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:04,995
Psychopaths
and mystery writers.

4
00:00:05,233 --> 00:00:06,255
I'm the kind that pays better.

5
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:07,256
Who am I?

6
00:00:07,345 --> 00:00:08,484
I'm Rick Castle.

7
00:00:08,485 --> 00:00:08,885
Castle.

8
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:09,579
Castle.

9
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,580
I really am ruggedly handsome,
aren't I?

10
00:00:11,726 --> 00:00:13,916
Every writer needs inspiration.
And I found mine.

11
00:00:14,126 --> 00:00:14,945
Detective Kate Beckett.

12
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,000
- Beckett.
- Beckett.

13
00:00:16,035 --> 00:00:17,941
- Nikki Heat?
- The character he's basing on you.

14
00:00:17,987 --> 00:00:19,473
And thanks to my friendship
with the mayor,

15
00:00:19,474 --> 00:00:20,474
I get to be on her case.

16
00:00:20,508 --> 00:00:22,451
I would be happy
to let you spank me.

17
00:00:22,486 --> 00:00:23,362
And together, we catch killers

18
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:25,298
we make a pretty
good team, you know?

19
00:00:25,299 --> 00:00:26,299
Like Starsky and Hutch.

20
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:27,127
Turner and Hooch.

21
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,090
You do remind me
a little of Hooch.

22
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:31,291
and did you hear?

23
00:00:31,676 --> 00:00:34,048
Our favorite golfer
is in the news again.

24
00:00:34,987 --> 00:00:36,758
Missed a charity tournament
over the weekend.

25
00:00:37,116 --> 00:00:38,181
Really unfortunate

26
00:00:38,301 --> 00:00:40,866
The world's top golfer
had to pull out.

27
00:00:41,113 --> 00:00:43,453
In fact, it's the first time
he's pulled out of anything

28
00:00:43,573 --> 00:00:46,650
In five years.

29
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:49,032
Ouch. Ouch. What do you think,
Hank? Should I take a mulligan?

30
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:51,414
No, play through, Bobby. Play through.
I will, my friend.

31
00:00:51,534 --> 00:00:53,129
We have a great show
for you tonight.

32
00:00:53,249 --> 00:00:54,814
Mr. Castle.
Ellie Monroe is here. She has
a new movie opening tomorrow.

33
00:00:54,934 --> 00:00:56,529
Hi, I'm Kayla.
Please follow me.
Sure.

34
00:00:57,236 --> 00:00:59,614
And my favorite writer
Richard Castle's joining us.

35
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,217
Here you go, Mr. Castle.

36
00:01:02,337 --> 00:01:03,819
Deb, the makeup artist,
will take care of you from here.

37
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:04,681
Thank you, Kayla.

38
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,209
And you're up
right after Ms. Monroe.

39
00:01:08,697 --> 00:01:09,941
Hi, it's Ellie.

40
00:01:10,224 --> 00:01:11,119
Rick.

41
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:13,226
Can I just say...
wow.

42
00:01:13,346 --> 00:01:15,002
Like, I can't believe
I'm meeting you right now.

43
00:01:15,122 --> 00:01:15,704
Really?

44
00:01:15,824 --> 00:01:17,848
Well, you're, like,
my favorite author ever.

45
00:01:18,168 --> 00:01:20,414
I mean, I've read "Heat Wave "
at least three times.

46
00:01:20,534 --> 00:01:22,150
Can I tell you, I have seen
every movie you've ever been in?

47
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:22,985
Really?

48
00:01:23,105 --> 00:01:25,197
Oh. Not "Viper Mountain"
I hope.

49
00:01:25,317 --> 00:01:26,188
Yes, "Viper Mountain."
ugh.

50
00:01:26,308 --> 00:01:27,592
You were
the best thing in that movie.

51
00:01:27,605 --> 00:01:30,907
As soon as that snake ate you,
whole movie fell apart.

52
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,217
Folks, please help me
in welcoming Richard Castle.

53
00:01:34,337 --> 00:01:38,088
Rick Castle.

54
00:01:38,089 --> 00:01:39,524
Oh-ho-ho-ho.
Whoo!

55
00:01:39,525 --> 00:01:40,467
Oh, he looks good.

56
00:01:40,587 --> 00:01:42,007
<i>Welcome.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

57
00:01:42,127 --> 00:01:44,623
First of all, congratulations
on "Heat Wave "--

58
00:01:44,743 --> 00:01:46,311
"New York Times"
best seller.

59
00:01:46,431 --> 00:01:47,136
Thank you.
And you know what?

60
00:01:47,256 --> 00:01:49,140
I really loved writing it.

61
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,419
Well, the paperback comes out,
uh, July 27th, right?

62
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:52,482
July 27th. That's right.

63
00:01:52,602 --> 00:01:54,463
And it's being made into a movie.
Nice.

64
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:58,379
<i>Now you worked with actual</i>
<i>NYPD Homicide Detectives</i>

65
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,814
<i>to research "Heat Wave ."</i>

66
00:01:59,815 --> 00:02:00,690
<i>Yes, yes, I did.</i>

67
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,649
And--and they still
won't let me carry a gun.

68
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,923
I didn't know you worked
with law enforcement.

69
00:02:06,983 --> 00:02:08,892
It's kinda my weak spot.
Hello.

70
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:11,467
Waiter, check please.

71
00:02:11,587 --> 00:02:13,116
Well, you guys
are single, right?

72
00:02:13,236 --> 00:02:14,810
Well, actually,
not anymore, Bobby.

73
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:15,982
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

74
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:17,384
<i>Oh.</i>

75
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,115
<i>Wow. The camera really does</i>
<i>add 10 pounds...</i>

76
00:02:20,193 --> 00:02:21,043
to his ego.

77
00:02:21,163 --> 00:02:22,224
<i>Call me old-fashioned--</i>

78
00:02:22,344 --> 00:02:23,591
<i>When a beautiful movie star</i>
<i>is impressed with</i>

79
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:25,600
<i>my fake law enforcement</i>
<i>credentials, I'm in.</i>

80
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,352
Do you think he's
asked her out yet?

81
00:02:27,472 --> 00:02:29,802
Your father,
pretty girl like that?

82
00:02:29,922 --> 00:02:31,580
He may have proposed
by now.

83
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,998
And that's our show for tonight.

84
00:02:33,118 --> 00:02:35,068
Stay tuned for
"Late Talk with Mickey Reed."

85
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,434
I'm Bobby Mann.
Remember, folks...

86
00:02:37,554 --> 00:02:40,297
The boys'll
be back on duty tomorrow night.

87
00:02:45,313 --> 00:02:46,902
I always wonder
what they're saying

88
00:02:47,022 --> 00:02:48,057
when they lean in like that.

89
00:02:48,177 --> 00:02:49,745
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.

90
00:02:50,105 --> 00:02:51,614
They want me dead.

91
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,660
I'm sorry. What?
I'm serious.

92
00:02:53,956 --> 00:02:55,643
You work with cops, right?
They want--

93
00:02:55,763 --> 00:02:57,494
That was
a great show, guys.

94
00:02:57,614 --> 00:02:59,213
I'm so sorry
about segment three.

95
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,382
Next time we put the emu in a diaper.
Mm-hmm.

96
00:03:01,652 --> 00:03:04,087
I'll call you.
Oh, the box-in-box with Justin...

97
00:03:04,088 --> 00:03:06,023
Yeah.
Looked great.
I loved it.

98
00:03:06,024 --> 00:03:08,458
Good, good.
Listen, I think we should...

99
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,831
Um... you're going
orienteering not librarying.

100
00:03:16,832 --> 00:03:18,978
You sure you want to take
that many books?

101
00:03:19,777 --> 00:03:21,335
Overambitious
for a 5-day trip?

102
00:03:21,336 --> 00:03:23,653
You're gonna be responsible
for your own pack.

103
00:03:24,465 --> 00:03:26,510
I think you're supposed
to be more Sacagawea

104
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,008
than a scholarly reader.

105
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:29,736
Besides,
look at all those pages.

106
00:03:29,856 --> 00:03:32,311
The trees might want revenge.
Richard.

107
00:03:33,617 --> 00:03:34,491
What's wrong?

108
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:37,266
Bobby Mann is dead.

109
00:03:37,886 --> 00:03:39,099
What? What happened?

110
00:03:39,354 --> 00:03:40,908
They're saying he had
a heart attack.

111
00:03:46,695 --> 00:03:49,263
I'm telling you, the guy said
that somebody wanted him dead,

112
00:03:49,264 --> 00:03:51,733
and then he ends up dead.
That can't be a coincidence.

113
00:03:51,734 --> 00:03:53,702
Bobby Mann had a history
of heart disease,

114
00:03:53,703 --> 00:03:55,538
and on the autopsy reports,

115
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:57,976
it states that the cause
of death was a heart attack.

116
00:03:58,661 --> 00:03:59,754
That can't be
a coincidence either.

117
00:03:59,874 --> 00:04:01,023
Did Lanie do the autopsy?

118
00:04:01,143 --> 00:04:02,570
No, but she sent it
to me.

119
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:04,835
Okay, a guy
was walking his dog,

120
00:04:04,955 --> 00:04:07,102
saw Mr. Mann collapse
on the sidewalk alone.

121
00:04:07,484 --> 00:04:09,206
But there'no puncture wounds,
no bruising,

122
00:04:09,326 --> 00:04:10,810
and the tox panel
came back negative.

123
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,251
There's no foul play,
Castle.

124
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:17,329
I talked to his producer
this morning.

125
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:20,298
She said that Mann
left the studio at 12:45

126
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:23,263
in his Bugatti Veyron.
That's a $2-million car.

127
00:04:23,383 --> 00:04:26,233
He collapsed on foot
a few blocks from his house

128
00:04:26,353 --> 00:04:28,071
at 4:50
so?

129
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:29,919
So where's the car?

130
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:31,336
He's, like,
a gazillionaire, Castle.

131
00:04:31,456 --> 00:04:33,185
He probably just parked it
and expected someone else

132
00:04:33,305 --> 00:04:34,380
to pick it up
the next morning.

133
00:04:35,612 --> 00:04:38,256
In my book "Gathering Storm,"
the former KGB official

134
00:04:38,376 --> 00:04:39,848
killed with
an undetectable poison

135
00:04:39,968 --> 00:04:41,659
that stopped the heart.

136
00:04:41,913 --> 00:04:42,942
What if that's
what happened to Mann?

137
00:04:43,062 --> 00:04:45,640
Need I remind you that you
make up stuff for a living,

138
00:04:46,182 --> 00:04:48,151
and there is no such poison
in real life,

139
00:04:48,152 --> 00:04:50,316
and if there was,
there would be a whole slew

140
00:04:50,436 --> 00:04:52,657
of angry spouses who'd be
getting away with murder?

141
00:04:52,777 --> 00:04:55,044
Could you just have Lanie
take a closer look?

142
00:04:55,823 --> 00:04:57,014
Please.

143
00:04:59,961 --> 00:05:02,499
You know how many strings
I had to pull for this Castle?

144
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:04,643
If I'm wrong,
I'll reimburse the city.

145
00:05:05,031 --> 00:05:07,013
To hell with the city
it's me you're gonna owe.

146
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:09,206
I take spa certificates,
jewelry and cash.

147
00:05:09,326 --> 00:05:10,327
Duly noted. What's that?

148
00:05:10,447 --> 00:05:13,173
The contents of Bobby Mann's
pockets when he was bought in.

149
00:05:14,553 --> 00:05:15,563
I'm gonna go check
on the Labs.

150
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:16,893
Okay.

151
00:05:18,211 --> 00:05:19,441
What are you doing?

152
00:05:19,442 --> 00:05:21,878
It's called investigating.
You should try it.

153
00:05:22,245 --> 00:05:24,179
I usually wait
until there's a crime.

154
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,349
Cell phone, ney clip.

155
00:05:27,015 --> 00:05:28,459
He stuck a piece of gum
to a paper

156
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:29,875
before he put it
in his pocket.

157
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:32,159
One of his last acts
was <i>not</i> littering.

158
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:34,587
Yes, but there's a word
on this paper--"tory."

159
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,333
Could be a mystery woman.

160
00:05:36,631 --> 00:05:38,887
Wow, Castle.
Cracking this case wide open.

161
00:05:38,888 --> 00:05:40,688
Hey, it's his idea notepad.

162
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:42,648
This is a joke from last night.
"charity golf.

163
00:05:42,768 --> 00:05:44,569
First time he's pulled out in years."
do you realize

164
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:46,503
that you are now
investigating a heart attack?

165
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:49,561
Hmm.

166
00:05:49,562 --> 00:05:50,696
What?

167
00:05:50,697 --> 00:05:51,832
His signature line
of 20 years,

168
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:53,557
"the boys'll be back
on duty tomorrow night,"

169
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:55,279
Looks like he was thinking
of changing it.

170
00:05:57,668 --> 00:05:59,802
"the crew will be back
on duty tomorrow night."

171
00:05:59,803 --> 00:06:01,262
Maybe he was trying
to make it hipper.

172
00:06:01,382 --> 00:06:02,432
Mm.

173
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:04,492
We should have
a signature line.

174
00:06:05,753 --> 00:06:07,441
She's armed, he's dangerous.

175
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,852
No.
No.

176
00:06:09,972 --> 00:06:10,896
How about

177
00:06:11,016 --> 00:06:12,766
a whole new chapter
in crime solving?

178
00:06:13,238 --> 00:06:13,881
Ooh.

179
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:15,605
Chapter. Get it?

180
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:16,522
No.

181
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:19,849
Okay, I ran
every extra tox screen

182
00:06:19,969 --> 00:06:21,784
outside of standard protocol.

183
00:06:21,785 --> 00:06:24,883
All negative, no trace of any
known poisonous substance.

184
00:06:25,003 --> 00:06:25,802
Okay, Castle?

185
00:06:25,922 --> 00:06:27,083
Don't forget to tip your M.E.

186
00:06:27,203 --> 00:06:28,537
on the way out.
Ah, not so fast.

187
00:06:28,758 --> 00:06:29,953
Secondary tox panel

188
00:06:30,073 --> 00:06:32,639
detected traces of Tyramine,
which is harmless,

189
00:06:32,956 --> 00:06:35,014
but it's presence raised
a red flag for me.

190
00:06:35,134 --> 00:06:36,464
So I ran some more tests.

191
00:06:36,821 --> 00:06:38,829
Bobby Mann was taking Phenelzine.

192
00:06:39,063 --> 00:06:39,840
Phenelzine?

193
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,236
A prescription drug for depression.
So?

194
00:06:42,356 --> 00:06:44,526
So Phenelzine
is in a class of drugs

195
00:06:44,646 --> 00:06:46,033
called M.A.O. Inhibitors

196
00:06:46,153 --> 00:06:47,770
That have powerful
contra-indicators.

197
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,324
You mean drug interactions?

198
00:06:49,444 --> 00:06:51,878
In this case,
interactions that can kill.

199
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:54,146
M.A.O. Inhibitors
contra-indicate

200
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:57,048
with anything fermented--
wine, beer,

201
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,107
certain kind of cheeses.

202
00:06:58,227 --> 00:07:01,284
Even the smallest amount can
trigger a hypertensive crisis.

203
00:07:01,285 --> 00:07:03,853
Oh! Almost like an undetectable
poison that stops the heart.

204
00:07:03,854 --> 00:07:05,374
Which doesn't mean
that he was murdered.

205
00:07:05,494 --> 00:07:07,908
He could've accidentally eaten or drank
something he shouldn't have.

206
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:10,773
That's what I thought. So I ran
the contents of his intestines.

207
00:07:11,227 --> 00:07:12,543
In the hours
prior to his death,

208
00:07:12,663 --> 00:07:14,181
he ingested three substances--

209
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:16,279
Something sugary,
like hard candy...

210
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,170
or chewing gum.

211
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,144
There you go.

212
00:07:18,264 --> 00:07:21,445
Also cranberry juice
and balsamic vinegar.

213
00:07:21,565 --> 00:07:22,768
Which is fermented.

214
00:07:22,888 --> 00:07:24,705
And there was no trace
of anything

215
00:07:24,706 --> 00:07:26,173
that you would find
balsamic on--

216
00:07:26,174 --> 00:07:28,528
No chicken, no fish
no pasta.

217
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:29,894
Just the cranberry juice.

218
00:07:30,014 --> 00:07:31,593
Which could've easily
masked the color

219
00:07:31,713 --> 00:07:33,137
and the taste
of the balsamic vinegar.

220
00:07:33,257 --> 00:07:33,876
So you're saying

221
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:35,847
that somebody knew about
Bobby Mann's condition,

222
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:37,676
slipped balsamic vinegar
into his cranberry juice,

223
00:07:37,796 --> 00:07:39,327
knowing that
it would kill him?

224
00:07:39,447 --> 00:07:40,573
This was no accident

225
00:07:41,054 --> 00:07:42,846
Bobby Mann was murdered.

226
00:07:43,804 --> 00:07:45,886
Well, Bobby, you were right.

227

No crime scene,
no clear place

230
00:07:55,062 --> 00:07:56,595
to begin the investigation.

231
00:07:56,596 --> 00:07:58,746
Don't you
just <i>love</i> poisoning?

232
00:07:58,866 --> 00:08:01,060
Especially a poisoning
without poison.

233
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,886
Whoever did this
was very smart.

234
00:08:03,181 --> 00:08:04,513
They chose a murder weapon
that's probably

235
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:06,448
in half the kitchens
in the city.

236
00:08:06,568 --> 00:08:07,725
Good thing we're smart, too.

237
00:08:07,845 --> 00:08:08,655
Thanks.

238
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,041
That was Lanie.

239
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,704
Based on possible rates of
fatal M.A.O. interactions,

240
00:08:12,824 --> 00:08:15,036
she was able to narrow
the window of poisoning to

241
00:08:15,156 --> 00:08:16,811
between 1:30 and 4:30
in the morning.

242
00:08:16,921 --> 00:08:18,321
That makes

243
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:20,480
this...

244
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:25,746
our kill zone--
1:30 to 4:30.

245
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:27,154
What else?

246
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:29,454
Well, the lab said that there
was no traces of cranberry juice

247
00:08:29,549 --> 00:08:32,016
or balsamic vinegar in the gum
we found in Mann's pocket.

248
00:08:32,275 --> 00:08:34,302
So he must have chewed that
before he was poisoned.

249
00:08:34,422 --> 00:08:36,135
Well, we know he left
the studio at 12:45.

250
00:08:36,255 --> 00:08:37,693
Which means
he wasn't poisoned there.

251
00:08:37,813 --> 00:08:39,569
And we know that his
home security records

252
00:08:39,689 --> 00:08:40,871
show that he never
made it there.

253
00:08:40,991 --> 00:08:43,209
12:45 to 4:50 in the morning,

254
00:08:43,329 --> 00:08:45,040
leaves in his car,
is found on foot.

255
00:08:45,787 --> 00:08:47,228
So what was he doing
that whole time?

256
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,853
So the vehicle locator

257
00:08:48,973 --> 00:08:50,744
in Mann's Bugatti
is not sending a signal.

258
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:52,735
Probably in
an underground parking garage.

259
00:08:52,855 --> 00:08:53,980
Which means
it could be anywhere.

260
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,903
Check his cell phone, see if
he made any calls last night,

261
00:08:57,023 --> 00:08:59,008
And then go to his Brownstone.
Castle and I will head

262
00:08:59,128 --> 00:09:00,946
to the studio and see
what we can dig up there.

263
00:09:01,066 --> 00:09:02,463
Oh, guys.
Yeah.

264
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,256
No talk of murder.

265
00:09:04,376 --> 00:09:05,291
The longer we can keep this

266
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:06,719
away from the press,
the better off we'll be.

267
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,090
I'm sorry.

268
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,370
I don't know where he went
after the show last night.

269
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,228
What is this about anyway?
I thought Bobby...

270
00:09:13,984 --> 00:09:15,358
Died of
a heart attack, right?

271
00:09:15,478 --> 00:09:17,358
We're just tying up loose ends
for the coroner.

272
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:20,015
How was Mr. Mann
acting recently?

273
00:09:20,135 --> 00:09:21,289
Did you notice
anything unusual?

274
00:09:21,647 --> 00:09:23,076
No. He was great.

275
00:09:23,817 --> 00:09:26,591
Uh... except yesterday.

276
00:09:26,592 --> 00:09:29,093
What happened yesterday?
I don't know.

277
00:09:29,094 --> 00:09:31,762
I mean, he spent the morning
locked up in his office alone.

278
00:09:31,763 --> 00:09:32,899
And then the rest of the day,

279
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:35,364
he was agitated
and he was acting weird.

280
00:09:35,365 --> 00:09:37,766
Weird how?
Paranoid.

281
00:09:37,767 --> 00:09:39,723
At one point he asked me
if I had heard anything,

282
00:09:39,843 --> 00:09:42,581
and I said, "about what?"
and he just shrugged it off.

283
00:09:43,105 --> 00:09:45,539
Were you aware that he was on
powerful antidepressants?

284
00:09:46,642 --> 00:09:48,771
I mean, he tried to be
very private about it,

285
00:09:48,891 --> 00:09:50,980
but when he went on them,
he had to quit drinking,

286
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,533
and people wondered why.

287
00:09:52,653 --> 00:09:53,996
So word got around.

288
00:09:54,116 --> 00:09:55,866
You don't think that's
what killed him, do you?

289
00:09:56,222 --> 00:09:57,565
Something he ate or--
or drank?

290
00:09:58,206 --> 00:09:59,524
He was very careful.

291
00:09:59,644 --> 00:10:01,003
Like I said,
we're just following up.

292
00:10:03,157 --> 00:10:06,002
I keep looking over
at that curtain, you know,

293
00:10:06,995 --> 00:10:08,692
waiting for him
to walk through...

294
00:10:09,533 --> 00:10:12,561
like this was all
one big publicity stunt.

295
00:10:12,831 --> 00:10:14,296
The two of you
were close, right?

296
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,674
Since before all this.

297
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,262
Since we were just
kids together back in 'Nam.

298
00:10:18,669 --> 00:10:21,137
So he would've told you
if there was anything wrong?

299
00:10:21,138 --> 00:10:22,100
Like what?

300
00:10:23,098 --> 00:10:25,087
Like if he was concerned
for his well-being.

301
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,019
What's this all about?

302
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:27,793
I-I thought he died
of a heart attack.

303
00:10:28,101 --> 00:10:30,047
Just routine questioning,
Mr. McPhee.

304
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:31,667
You know, some of the people
said that he seemed

305
00:10:31,787 --> 00:10:33,416
a little agitated recently.

306
00:10:34,304 --> 00:10:36,484
Come to think of it,
he was a little preoccupied.

307
00:10:37,016 --> 00:10:39,250
I asked him about it
after the show last night,

308
00:10:39,251 --> 00:10:40,721
but he insisted he was fine.

309
00:10:41,453 --> 00:10:42,439
Hank.

310
00:10:43,154 --> 00:10:44,622
Man, I am so sorry.

311
00:10:44,742 --> 00:10:45,979
Aw.

312
00:10:46,534 --> 00:10:48,037
Nightmares really happen.
Huh?

313
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:50,295
Yeah. You know Mickey--

314
00:10:50,415 --> 00:10:52,109
Host of "Late Talk,"
right after our show?

315
00:10:52,229 --> 00:10:53,664
Yes, of course.
I'm a big fan.

316
00:10:53,665 --> 00:10:55,241
I love your whole
"booty roulette" gag.

317
00:10:55,361 --> 00:10:56,547
That's great. I'm Rick.
Castle.

318
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:58,099
Ah. Saw you
on the show last night.

319
00:10:58,219 --> 00:10:59,843
I'm Detective Kate Beckett.
Nice to meet you.

320
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:01,744
So do either of you know
where Bobby went

321
00:11:01,864 --> 00:11:02,779
after the show last night?

322
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:05,292
We're trying to track his last
hours for the coroner's report.

323
00:11:06,318 --> 00:11:07,173
No clue.

324
00:11:07,716 --> 00:11:10,241
I think he said something about
going to see his ex-wife.

325
00:11:10,907 --> 00:11:12,769
Did he say which one?
Mnh-mnh.

326
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:14,241
How many ex-wives
did he have?

327
00:11:14,361 --> 00:11:18,698
6, ranging in ages
from 25 to 50.

328
00:11:19,572 --> 00:11:22,073
It seems every five years, he
traded in for the latest model.

329
00:11:22,193 --> 00:11:24,609
So he didn't so much
marry them as lease them.

330
00:11:24,954 --> 00:11:26,334
So I ran all their names
through the system,

331
00:11:26,454 --> 00:11:27,760
and guess what popped up.

332
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,421
Seems wife number five here
was arrested

333
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,710
over an altercation with Bobby
at a restaurant Uptown.

334
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,814
She's got crazy eyes.

335
00:11:35,085 --> 00:11:37,274
Well, there's more. According
to the doorman in her building,

336
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:39,652
Bobby Mann was there
last night after the show.

337
00:11:39,772 --> 00:11:42,070
Mrs. Mann, when was the last
time you saw your ex-husband?

338
00:11:43,132 --> 00:11:44,065
About a year ago...

339
00:11:45,615 --> 00:11:46,787
in court.

340
00:11:47,049 --> 00:11:49,061
He took out a restraining order
against me.

341
00:11:50,102 --> 00:11:51,397
Well, according to
the complaint,

342
00:11:51,398 --> 00:11:52,781
you did threaten to kill him.

343
00:11:53,974 --> 00:11:55,749
Well, I don't really remember
what was said.

344
00:11:56,076 --> 00:11:58,305
"I wish you were dead,
you little weasel."

345
00:11:58,306 --> 00:12:01,623
He was dating a younger woman,
and she looked just like me.

346
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:03,122
Tell that
to his previous wife.

347
00:12:03,242 --> 00:12:05,340
Were you aware of
his dietary restrictions?
Sure.

348
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,038
Nothing fermented or it could
give him a heart attack.

349
00:12:08,991 --> 00:12:11,419
Why? You think I had
something to do with it?

350
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:12,638
You tell me, Mrs. Mann.

351
00:12:13,353 --> 00:12:14,400
Acording to your doorman,

352
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,998
Bobby showed up
at your building last night.

353
00:12:16,387 --> 00:12:17,287
He did?

354
00:12:17,407 --> 00:12:19,138
Cindy,
we know you saw him.

355
00:12:19,258 --> 00:12:20,893
How do you know he wasn't
there to see Barbara?

356
00:12:21,224 --> 00:12:22,141
Barbara?

357
00:12:22,261 --> 00:12:23,238
His first wife.

358
00:12:23,925 --> 00:12:25,834
She's got an apartment
in the building, too.

359
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:29,014
We both got 'em
in the divorce settlement.

360
00:12:29,134 --> 00:12:30,529
Bobby co-owned the building.

361
00:12:30,932 --> 00:12:32,386
Yeah,
I saw Bobby last night.

362
00:12:33,101 --> 00:12:35,035
He came by
around 1:00 in the morning,

363
00:12:35,036 --> 00:12:36,309
woke me up as usual.

364
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,136
Did he often surprise you
in the middle of the night?

365
00:12:39,606 --> 00:12:41,586
I was the one woman
who fell in love with him

366
00:12:41,706 --> 00:12:43,606
before all the fame
and the money.

367
00:12:44,443 --> 00:12:46,592
Whenever he felt insecure,
he came around.

368
00:12:47,602 --> 00:12:49,204
Mostly it was
the same old stuff--

369
00:12:49,814 --> 00:12:52,763
his ratings were down
or... he was getting old.

370
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,728
But last night...

371
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:57,720
What?

372
00:12:58,417 --> 00:12:59,427
It was different.

373
00:12:59,656 --> 00:13:01,648
He looked... haunted.

374
00:13:02,689 --> 00:13:04,305
He said
something was going on,

375
00:13:04,425 --> 00:13:05,459
something awful.

376
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,839
What was going on?
He wouldn't tell me.

377
00:13:08,396 --> 00:13:11,263
He asked me if I thought
he was a good person.

378
00:13:12,015 --> 00:13:13,900
And I held his hand
and I said, "Bobby,

379
00:13:14,434 --> 00:13:15,913
"you're a lousy husband,

380
00:13:16,973 --> 00:13:18,106
but you're a hell of a man."

381
00:13:20,373 --> 00:13:21,582
Then he left.

382
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:23,925
At what time?

383
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:26,655
Around quarter after 1:00.

384
00:13:28,305 --> 00:13:29,574
Did he say
where he was going?

385
00:13:30,281 --> 00:13:31,169
No.

386
00:13:33,283 --> 00:13:34,913
I thought he was going home.

387
00:13:36,531 --> 00:13:38,020
Something awful
was going on.

388
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:40,022
He knew
someone was after him.

389
00:13:40,023 --> 00:13:42,189
But he doesn't tell his ex-wife
or his best friend.

390
00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:43,248
Instead he tells me.

391
00:13:43,642 --> 00:13:46,120
Maybe it's because he knew
you were working with the cops.

392
00:13:46,565 --> 00:13:48,118
Tell me I'm a good person?

393
00:13:48,685 --> 00:13:50,845
Like he was doing something
he was ashamed of.

394
00:13:50,965 --> 00:13:53,066
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

395
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:55,034
Neighbors confirm
Barbara Mann's story.

396
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:58,134
One of them saw Bobby leave
her apartment at 1:15 A.M.

397
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,722
That's outside of
our kill zone, which means

398
00:13:59,842 --> 00:14:02,050
we need to figure out
where he went to next.

399
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:04,490
Let's canvass
all the garages in the area,

400
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,871
see if we can find
Mann's car.

401
00:14:05,991 --> 00:14:07,573
And let's also look into
his financials

402
00:14:07,693 --> 00:14:08,985
for the usual secrets--

403
00:14:09,105 --> 00:14:10,894
drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Yeah.

404
00:14:11,014 --> 00:14:12,176
Okay.

405
00:14:15,331 --> 00:14:16,132
Hello.

406
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,469
Ellie? Hi.

407
00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:20,523
Ellie Monroe,
from the show.

408
00:14:20,524 --> 00:14:22,555
Yeah.
No, I know.

409
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,072
I understand.

410
00:14:24,962 --> 00:14:26,434
No, I think that's
a-a great idea.

411
00:14:27,464 --> 00:14:28,364
Yeah.

412
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:29,959
Okay, I'll meet you there.

413
00:14:30,334 --> 00:14:31,467
Bye.

414
00:14:32,603 --> 00:14:34,236
Ellie Monroe, huh?

415
00:14:34,237 --> 00:14:37,654
Yeah, she's pretty upset about
this whole Bobby Mann thing,

416
00:14:37,774 --> 00:14:39,349
That we were
his last guests.

417
00:14:39,657 --> 00:14:40,987
She thinks
it would be comforting

418
00:14:41,107 --> 00:14:42,971
if we were to be together.
"comforting"?

419
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,570
Is that what the cool kids
call it these days?

420
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:48,046
Wow.

421
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:49,476
You are so cynical.

422
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,936
You know,
sometimes after a tragedy,

423
00:14:52,056 --> 00:14:55,109
two human beings just need
to--to be with each other

424
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:57,854
just for no other reason
than to show each other

425
00:14:57,974 --> 00:14:59,651
some understanding
and support.

426
00:15:00,838 --> 00:15:02,519
Mm! Mm.
Mm.

427
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,354
Mm.

428
00:15:04,355 --> 00:15:07,923
Mm. I'm just glad
I can be comforting.

429
00:15:07,924 --> 00:15:09,424
Ahh.

430
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,128
Oh! Yes.

431
00:15:15,635 --> 00:15:16,990
Good morning, Detective.

432
00:15:19,738 --> 00:15:20,526
Really?

433
00:15:21,282 --> 00:15:22,236
What?

434
00:15:22,237 --> 00:15:24,219
Lose the "I just got laid"
voice, all right?

435
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:25,691
What are you talking about?

436
00:15:25,811 --> 00:15:28,069
I am a trained Detective,
so don't bother denying it.

437
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:29,957
Okay, fine.

438
00:15:30,773 --> 00:15:32,152
Oh, so now you're not
denying it?

439
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,173
You just told me not to.

440
00:15:36,582 --> 00:15:38,955
Hey, guys.
Any news on the car?

441
00:15:39,284 --> 00:15:41,516
Nothing at any of the garages
near Barbara Mann's building.

442
00:15:41,636 --> 00:15:43,566
So we checked
restaurant valets in the area.

443
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,053
Bobby paid the guy
at Mozart's 100 bucks

444
00:15:46,314 --> 00:15:48,297
to keep it close
while he ran up to his ex.

445
00:15:48,417 --> 00:15:50,141
Witness says he left
a little before 1:30.

446
00:15:53,121 --> 00:15:55,671
61st and Central Park West.

447
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,931
Where did he go after that?

448
00:15:59,051 --> 00:16:00,962
Maybe check
traffic cams in the area.

449
00:16:01,082 --> 00:16:02,140
A guy
in a sports car like that

450
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,766
might have blasted through
some red lights..

451
00:16:03,886 --> 00:16:05,725
Yeah. It's a bit of a hail Mary,
but it's worth a try

452
00:16:05,845 --> 00:16:07,116
Maybe we don't need
traffic cams.

453
00:16:07,236 --> 00:16:08,360
Why not just
the man on the street?

454
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,809
I mean, a celebrity
in a Bugatti Veyron? Come on.

455
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:12,354
People aren't
just gonna notice that.

456
00:16:12,474 --> 00:16:15,927
They are going to talk about it,
or more specifically, Tweet.

457
00:16:16,047 --> 00:16:17,701
And...

458
00:16:17,702 --> 00:16:18,802
Booyah.

459
00:16:18,803 --> 00:16:21,371
37 A.M. Bobby Mann F.T.W.

460
00:16:21,372 --> 00:16:23,323
"just saw him driving
some spaceship car

461
00:16:23,443 --> 00:16:25,615
into a garage
at Broadway and 57th."

462
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:26,699
Ooh.
On it.

463
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:30,061
"F.T.W."?
"for the win."

464
00:16:30,181 --> 00:16:33,742
It means, uh, "my Tweet
kicks your Tweet's butt."

465
00:16:33,862 --> 00:16:35,741
Come on, Beckett. You gotta keep
up. Hang with the cool kids.

466
00:16:36,118 --> 00:16:37,651
<i>♪ how much I feel ♪</i>

467
00:16:37,652 --> 00:16:39,119
<i>♪ feel for you, baby... ♪</i>

468
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,221
<i>(am</i> I believe this is for you.

469
00:16:42,756 --> 00:16:45,591
Um, I'll just--
um, I'll just take that.

470
00:16:45,592 --> 00:16:48,093
I'm just gonna... take that.
Mm-hmm.

471
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:50,095
Pardon me one sec.

472
00:16:50,096 --> 00:16:52,263
Hey, Ellie.

473
00:16:52,264 --> 00:16:53,764
Yes, yes.

474
00:16:53,765 --> 00:16:55,917
Last night was great,
wasn't it?

475
00:16:56,907 --> 00:16:58,188
Yeah, I'd love to.

476
00:16:58,603 --> 00:17:00,140
Tonight? Sure.

477
00:17:01,052 --> 00:17:02,247
All right.
I'll see you then.

478
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:05,282
More comforting?

479
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,843
Uh--

480
00:17:07,844 --> 00:17:09,677
Parking garage
at 1525 Broadway confirms

481
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:11,612
Bobby Mann
pulled in at 1:37 A.M.

482
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,514
and he never came back
for his car.

483
00:17:13,515 --> 00:17:15,282
And what's at 1525 Broadway?

484
00:17:15,283 --> 00:17:17,284
The ParkVview Penthouse
of Mickey Reed,

485
00:17:17,285 --> 00:17:19,271
the gregarious and affable
host of "Late Talk."

486
00:17:19,854 --> 00:17:21,628
Oh, Mickey...
Not so fine.

487
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,435
Doorman let Bobby up
to his flat 1:45 A.M.

488
00:17:24,555 --> 00:17:26,249
Neighbors complained of
a loud argument.

489
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:27,728
Bobby left
a little after 2:00.

490
00:17:27,848 --> 00:17:29,211
So Mickey lied to us.

491
00:17:29,331 --> 00:17:32,599
He saw Bobby somewhere right
in the middle of our kill zone.

492
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:35,077
You think he was
a good host,

493
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:36,568
offered Bobby a drink?

494
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,134
This set looks like
an old-age home.

495
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:49,002
<i>Everything</i> needs to be
updated--no purple, no suede,

496
00:17:49,434 --> 00:17:52,002
no faux finish--and get rid
of this stupid thing.

497
00:17:52,122 --> 00:17:53,789
Measuring drapes already,
Mr. Reed?

498
00:17:54,478 --> 00:17:55,871
Like it or not, Detective,

499
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,433
the network
wants me to take over

500
00:17:57,553 --> 00:17:59,847
Bobby's time slot next week
right after the tribute.

501
00:18:00,652 --> 00:18:01,736
I know it seems callous,

502
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:03,945
but it's what Bobby
would've wanted.

503
00:18:04,314 --> 00:18:06,088
Even over his dead body.
Excuse Me?

504
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,343
Why did you lie to us about
seeing Mann the other night?

505
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,180
Ay.

506
00:18:13,181 --> 00:18:15,148
Look, I'm sorry,

507
00:18:15,149 --> 00:18:17,278
but I lied because I didn't
want it getting out.

508
00:18:17,398 --> 00:18:18,411
that you two were fighting?

509
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:20,967
It's hard enough filling
the man's shoes around here.

510
00:18:21,087 --> 00:18:23,333
I don't need the tabloids
writing out us getting into it

511
00:18:23,453 --> 00:18:24,671
on the night he died.

512
00:18:25,164 --> 00:18:28,108
So I lied. So what?
So you lied to a cop.

513
00:18:28,725 --> 00:18:30,692
Let's be realistic.

514
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,411
The guy died from
a heart attack, right?

515
00:18:33,761 --> 00:18:34,464
What?

516
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:36,009
It was a heart attack
that was a result

517
00:18:36,129 --> 00:18:38,563
of toxins in his system,
toxins that he ingested

518
00:18:38,564 --> 00:18:40,798
somewhere around the time
that you saw him.

519
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,174
So you guys
are saying I killed Bobby?

520
00:18:44,939 --> 00:18:46,501
Why?
Well, it's no secret,

521
00:18:46,621 --> 00:18:48,251
you were supposed to get
his 11:30 slot,

522
00:18:48,485 --> 00:18:50,111
But Bobby
extended his contract.

523
00:18:50,577 --> 00:18:51,710
Maybe you couldn't wait.

524
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,396
You sound as demented as Bobby.
What do you mean?

525
00:18:54,618 --> 00:18:56,762
Last time I saw him,
we're best of pals, right?

526
00:18:57,181 --> 00:18:59,415
The other night he comes over,
he's ranting and raving,

527
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,395
talking about
what a disloyal punk I've been.

528
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,083
Why?
Man, I don't know.

529
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:05,117
All he kept saying was,
he knew things.

530
00:19:05,522 --> 00:19:07,272
And I'm like, "Bobby,
what are you talking about?"

531
00:19:07,654 --> 00:19:09,995
He storms out saying
I knew what I'd done.

532
00:19:12,726 --> 00:19:15,993
C.S.U.'s at Mickey's apartment
running a sweep for our toxin.

533
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,733
Killing the king of late-night
to take his throne--

534
00:19:17,734 --> 00:19:18,709
It's very "Richard III."

535
00:19:18,829 --> 00:19:20,497
It appeals to the writer in me.
Did you want a bite of this?

536
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,034
Hell, I'll sick God on you!
And you?

537
00:19:25,947 --> 00:19:27,656
I don't ever want to see you
on my network again.

538
00:19:27,776 --> 00:19:29,726
You're banned! And you?!

539
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:31,562
I don't know you.

540
00:19:32,691 --> 00:19:35,155
You're all a bunch of nobodies!
I could buy this precinct!

541
00:19:38,324 --> 00:19:40,324
Howard Weisberg,
President of the network.

542
00:19:40,325 --> 00:19:41,685
He just found out about
the search warrant

543
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:42,781
for Mickey Reed.

544
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:45,122
And he also found out that we
think Bobby Mann was murdered.

545
00:19:45,242 --> 00:19:45,751
How?

546
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:47,883
Breaking news
on a <i>different</i> network.

547
00:19:48,003 --> 00:19:50,495
The guy got scooped on his
own star's murder.

548
00:19:50,717 --> 00:19:52,146
So much for keeping
the press out.

549
00:19:52,266 --> 00:19:53,563
You two better be right
about all this.

550
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:59,362
Text giggling? Really?

551
00:20:00,297 --> 00:20:02,491
It's Alexis.
She just saw a loon feeding.

552
00:20:02,611 --> 00:20:04,052
Funny. So did I.

553
00:20:04,172 --> 00:20:07,769
Hey. So... Mann's Bugatti
is still in the garage.

554
00:20:07,889 --> 00:20:09,528
They won't let us touch it
without a search warrant.

555
00:20:09,848 --> 00:20:10,784
$2-million car.

556
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:13,177
Apparently, it's worth me
than their insurance policy.

557
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:14,553
You re they ar't
joyriding?

558
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:16,414
All right, check with the judge.
Mm-hmm.

559
00:20:18,308 --> 00:20:19,624
Okay.
If his car is still in the garage,

560
00:20:20,408 --> 00:20:21,738
where'd he go
after Mickey's place?

561
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:24,037
Well, it couldn't have been
very far.

562
00:20:24,862 --> 00:20:26,741
Hey, Ryan.
Did Mickey's doorman mention

563
00:20:26,861 --> 00:20:28,542
in what direction Mann was headed
when he left?

564
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:31,018
Uh...
South.

565
00:20:31,467 --> 00:20:32,451
South.

566
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,188
South on Broadway
from 57th.

567
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:36,518
That's the theater district.

568
00:20:36,638 --> 00:20:38,391
At 2:00 in the morning?
There's nothing playing then.

569
00:20:38,511 --> 00:20:39,496
Well, there'diners,
there's clubs,

570
00:20:39,616 --> 00:20:40,437
there's restaurants.

571
00:20:40,557 --> 00:20:42,001
Well, other than the poison
and the gum,

572
00:20:42,121 --> 00:20:43,433
we know he didn't eat
or drink anything.

573
00:20:47,315 --> 00:20:49,417
Maybe "tory" is a place
he went.

574
00:20:49,537 --> 00:20:52,850
Uh, conservatory,
inventory, purgatory--

575
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:55,651
Factory! The Comic Factory.
Mann was a comedian.

576
00:20:55,652 --> 00:20:56,629
He went to a comedy club.

577
00:20:56,749 --> 00:20:58,769
Comic Factory is on, uh,
55th and Broadway.

578
00:20:58,889 --> 00:21:01,356
That's two blocks South.
He put his gum in a--

579
00:21:01,357 --> 00:21:02,399
in a piece of paper from
a comic factory flyer.

580
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:03,007
You're right.

581
00:21:03,127 --> 00:21:04,990
Then from the forenics, we know
he didn't have the cranberry

582
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,644
or the balsamic
before he spit it out.

583
00:21:06,764 --> 00:21:10,846
So he was poisoned either
<i>at</i> or <i>after</i> the club.

584
00:21:11,607 --> 00:21:13,333
Then Mickey Reed
didn't kill Bobby.

585
00:21:13,334 --> 00:21:15,301
He's not our guy.

586
00:21:15,302 --> 00:21:16,365
Hey, guys.

587
00:21:16,937 --> 00:21:18,488
How do you feel about
going to see a little comedy?

588
00:21:20,005 --> 00:21:21,964
The guy's got the most
recognizable face in comedy.

589
00:21:22,084 --> 00:21:22,703
Yeah, I know.

590
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,662
Look, I got a call
on the club phone.

591
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:26,743
The caller I.D.'s
from Bobby's show.

592
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,444
A guy asks about
one of my comedians.

593
00:21:28,445 --> 00:21:30,846
Couple hours later, guy shows up
to see that comedian,

594
00:21:30,847 --> 00:21:32,781
but he's got
a funny looking moustache

595
00:21:32,782 --> 00:21:35,450
and he's wearing a baseball cap.
It looked like Bobby.

596
00:21:35,451 --> 00:21:37,412
Did he talk to anyone?
Did he have a drink?

597
00:21:37,532 --> 00:21:38,934
No. He sat in the back,

598
00:21:39,054 --> 00:21:41,322
left his drink ticket,
and bolted out the side

599
00:21:41,323 --> 00:21:43,323
after watching the comedian
he came to see.

600
00:21:43,324 --> 00:21:45,525
Anything special about
this particular comedian?

601
00:21:45,526 --> 00:21:46,567
Angel Santana,

602
00:21:47,461 --> 00:21:49,429
the proverbial rising star?

603
00:21:50,503 --> 00:21:52,832
I'm assuming you know about
the incident that night?

604
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,169
What incident?

605
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:57,123
I'm Angel Santana.
Good night, y'all.

606
00:22:00,997 --> 00:22:02,000
Ms. Santana.

607
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:04,415
I'm Detective Esposito.
This is Detective Ryan.
Hey.

608
00:22:04,535 --> 00:22:05,696
Oh, hey.
Thanks for coming.

609
00:22:05,816 --> 00:22:08,333
The officer I talked to did not
instill a lot of confidence.

610
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:09,628
You want to tell us about it?

611
00:22:09,748 --> 00:22:11,624
Not much to tell.
During my set that night,

612
00:22:11,744 --> 00:22:13,210
someone smashed
my bike's taillight,

613
00:22:13,211 --> 00:22:14,380
banged up the fenders

614
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,524
and scratched "late-night bitch"
into the tank.

615
00:22:16,914 --> 00:22:18,127
I mean,
what does that even mean?

616
00:22:18,386 --> 00:22:19,865
Actually, we're not here
about your bike.

617
00:22:20,136 --> 00:22:22,267
Ms. Santana, did you know
Bobby Mann?

618
00:22:22,821 --> 00:22:24,386
You mean personally?
No. Why?

619
00:22:24,506 --> 00:22:26,407
Well, because he came to see
your act

620
00:22:26,527 --> 00:22:27,492
on the night he was killed.

621
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:29,464
Any idea why?
Wow.

622
00:22:29,858 --> 00:22:32,692
He probably trashed my bike.
I've heard stories about him.

623
00:22:32,693 --> 00:22:34,519
I know guys he's blackballed
just because they did

624
00:22:34,639 --> 00:22:35,957
his competitors' show.

625
00:22:36,077 --> 00:22:38,145
Is there any reason why he might
have wanted to come after you?

626
00:22:38,265 --> 00:22:40,463
His producer tried to book me
on his show last month,

627
00:22:40,771 --> 00:22:41,967
but Mickey Reed
wanted me, too.

628
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:45,050
I had to pick.
Mickey felt more like my vibe.

629
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:48,162
Club owner said
Bobby left at 2:30,

630
00:22:48,282 --> 00:22:50,134
and the bartender confirms
he didn't drink anything.

631
00:22:50,254 --> 00:22:54,543
Which leaves us...
Two hours left to account for

632
00:22:54,544 --> 00:22:56,735
and a whole lot
of strange behavior.

633
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,866
Why would Bobby go see
a comedian

634
00:22:58,986 --> 00:23:01,070
who didn't want to do his show
and then bust up her bike?

635
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:03,534
Aren't famous people crazy
and narcissistic?

636
00:23:03,654 --> 00:23:05,136
I don't know.
Gotta ask Castle.

637
00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:06,849
Where is Castle anyway?

638
00:23:07,321 --> 00:23:09,255
Mm. Mm. mm.

639
00:23:09,256 --> 00:23:12,357
Ah. Mm.

640
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:14,357
I'm gonna need
some new shirts.

641
00:23:14,358 --> 00:23:15,991
No shirts.

642
00:23:17,293 --> 00:23:18,726
mm. Mm.

643
00:23:20,762 --> 00:23:22,396
Good morning.

644
00:23:22,813 --> 00:23:24,585
It's okay, Castle.
You don't have to pretend

645
00:23:24,705 --> 00:23:26,365
to not be in a good mood
for my sake.

646
00:23:27,917 --> 00:23:29,278
Why should I
be in a good mood?

647
00:23:29,586 --> 00:23:30,940
I mean... I'm a writer.

648
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,575
We... famously brood.

649
00:23:33,695 --> 00:23:36,107
We... I should brood more.

650
00:23:36,108 --> 00:23:37,366
You want to brood?

651
00:23:38,656 --> 00:23:41,311
Forensics on
Angel Santana's motorcycle

652
00:23:41,558 --> 00:23:42,480
are a bust.

653
00:23:42,849 --> 00:23:44,192
There's no fingerprints.
Nothing.

654
00:23:44,312 --> 00:23:46,481
We have no idea
where Mann was after 2:30.

655
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,688
What about his car?

656
00:23:49,046 --> 00:23:51,149
Ryan and Esposito
got a warrant this morning.

657
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:53,897
But seeing that he was poisoned
after he parked it,

658
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:55,678
chances are
we won't find anything.

659
00:23:55,798 --> 00:23:57,391
And his financials
were clear.

660
00:23:57,958 --> 00:23:58,969
He pays more in alimony

661
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:01,433
in a day than I make
in an entire year.

662
00:24:01,553 --> 00:24:03,207
There's no red flags
on his phone records.

663
00:24:03,327 --> 00:24:04,981
And I reinterviewed
all of his colleagues.

664
00:24:05,101 --> 00:24:07,519
No one has any idea
why he was acting so paranoid.

665
00:24:07,639 --> 00:24:10,281
You're not paranoid if someone's
actually trying to kill you.

666
00:24:12,092 --> 00:24:14,359
Hey, Tony! How's my favorite
movie mogul?

667
00:24:16,149 --> 00:24:17,074
Yes. Right?

668
00:24:17,562 --> 00:24:18,547
She'd be perfect for Nikki.

669
00:24:19,212 --> 00:24:20,629
Yes.
Perfect.

670
00:24:21,957 --> 00:24:22,992
Thank you.

671
00:24:25,273 --> 00:24:27,207
That's a "Heat Wave "
producer.

672
00:24:28,447 --> 00:24:29,851
That wasn't about
Ellie Monroe, was it?

673
00:24:30,418 --> 00:24:32,007
Yeah, why?
Oh.

674
00:24:32,989 --> 00:24:33,963
What?

675
00:24:34,323 --> 00:24:36,005
That's why she was
throwing herself at you.

676
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:38,333
She wanted you to
recommend her for the part.

677
00:24:39,035 --> 00:24:39,741
What?

678
00:24:39,861 --> 00:24:41,895
Oh, and for the record,
she's nothing like Nikki Heat.

679
00:24:41,896 --> 00:24:44,459
Oh, you just can't stand it
that a beautiful actress

680
00:24:44,579 --> 00:24:46,726
is actually interested in me.
Why would I care?

681
00:24:46,846 --> 00:24:48,980
Exactly. That's a good question.
Why would you care?

682
00:24:49,402 --> 00:24:51,936
I don't.
<i>Fine.</i> I'm gonna go
get some coffee.

683
00:24:51,937 --> 00:24:53,308
Fine. I've got work to do.

684
00:24:55,741 --> 00:24:57,675
Break room's that way.

685
00:24:57,676 --> 00:24:59,376
Desk.
Beckett.

686
00:24:59,377 --> 00:25:01,378
Castle.
Check this out.

687
00:25:02,178 --> 00:25:03,914
We just finished the sweep
of Bobby's car.
Mm-hmm.

688
00:25:03,915 --> 00:25:06,282
First off, the Bugatti--
<i>holy shift.</i>

689
00:25:06,283 --> 00:25:08,007
When you start this thing,
you can feel it right in--

690
00:25:08,127 --> 00:25:10,053
<i>But</i> as exciting
as the car is,

691
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:12,656
I think we figured out why
Bobby Mann was so tweaked.

692
00:25:12,776 --> 00:25:14,861
We found this
in his glove compartment.

693
00:25:15,512 --> 00:25:18,530
That's Kayla. She's an intern
at Bobby's show.

694
00:25:19,155 --> 00:25:21,194
Looks like she was
doing more than interning.

695
00:25:21,195 --> 00:25:22,541
You should check out
the back.

696
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:24,741
"If they find out,
you're dead."

697
00:25:25,199 --> 00:25:27,366
Blackmail, death threats
and scandal.

698
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:29,302
That explains why his behavior
was so erratic.

699
00:25:29,422 --> 00:25:31,216
And probably
why he was killed.

700
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:33,990
It was last week.

701
00:25:34,528 --> 00:25:36,029
I stayed late to help Bobby
with some bits.

702
00:25:36,734 --> 00:25:38,262
Do you have any idea
who took that, Kayla?

703
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:40,483
Must be someone
who works on the show.

704
00:25:40,744 --> 00:25:42,531
Who just happened
to have a camera

705
00:25:42,651 --> 00:25:44,627
and managed to catch
the two of you in the act?

706
00:25:44,747 --> 00:25:46,169
Or were they
tipped off maybe?

707
00:25:48,007 --> 00:25:49,017
Were you blackmailing Bobby?

708
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,808
Oh, my God. No.
He's three times your age,

709
00:25:51,928 --> 00:25:53,717
and you are an intern
on the show.

710
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,584
That adds up to embarrassment
and scandal,

711
00:25:56,704 --> 00:25:58,260
which I'm sure
he'd pay a lot to avoid.

712
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,689
No, I would never do that.

713
00:26:01,197 --> 00:26:02,096
We were in love.

714
00:26:02,872 --> 00:26:04,080
In love? Really?

715
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,679
And... how long were
the two of you together?

716
00:26:07,616 --> 00:26:09,042
Three weeks
this past Monday.

717
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,675
Um...

718
00:26:12,327 --> 00:26:13,331
Who else knew?

719
00:26:13,969 --> 00:26:16,162
No one. Bobby and I
kept it a secret.

720
00:26:17,497 --> 00:26:19,014
We didn't want my mom
to find out.

721
00:26:20,225 --> 00:26:20,989
Your mom?

722
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,203
Who's your mom?

723
00:26:22,323 --> 00:26:24,524
He was banging my daughter
right under my nose?

724
00:26:24,644 --> 00:26:26,700
I will kill him!
He's already dead.

725
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,906
Well, I will kill him again.

726
00:26:28,026 --> 00:26:29,617
I don't care.
Where's the corpse?

727
00:26:29,737 --> 00:26:30,640
Ms. Marks, we just--

728
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,941
Kayla, my office, now!
Move it!

729
00:26:33,939 --> 00:26:35,245
Mom, you don't understand--
Move It!

730
00:26:35,365 --> 00:26:37,093
You realize, if this gets out,

731
00:26:37,213 --> 00:26:38,584
it'll destroy
Bobby's reputation.

732
00:26:38,704 --> 00:26:41,211
We're not trying to add to
an already difficult situation.

733
00:26:41,331 --> 00:26:42,418
We're just trying to find
the killer.

734
00:26:42,538 --> 00:26:43,564
Bobby wasn't an angel,

735
00:26:43,684 --> 00:26:45,634
but you look at the man
in his entirety.

736
00:26:45,754 --> 00:26:47,346
He deserves to be remembered
with grace.

737
00:26:47,466 --> 00:26:51,162
This business gets clouded
by money, fame, ambition.

738
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,647
The only thing that Bobby
really cared about

739
00:26:53,886 --> 00:26:55,093
was making people laugh.

740
00:26:55,783 --> 00:26:58,087
Well, whoever took this
either works for this show

741
00:26:58,207 --> 00:26:59,861
or had access
to this building.

742
00:26:59,981 --> 00:27:01,634
And maybe it was someone
in a financial jam

743
00:27:01,754 --> 00:27:03,260
who was looking to score
a quick buck.

744
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,248
Or maybe it's someone
with a grudge against Bobby.

745
00:27:06,305 --> 00:27:07,688
I can't imagine
anyone doing that.

746
00:27:07,808 --> 00:27:09,356
He was a great boss.
Everyone loved him.

747
00:27:09,476 --> 00:27:11,993
Yeah, and apparently,
he loved them back.

748
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:16,475
Okay. Uh, Janine can get you
a list of everyone on the crew

749
00:27:16,595 --> 00:27:18,323
once she's done
yelling at Kayla.

750
00:27:18,683 --> 00:27:19,385
Poor kid. Who knows?

751
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:20,839
She might have ended up
being number seven.

752
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:23,165
Excuse me.

753
00:27:23,697 --> 00:27:24,594
Beckett.

754
00:27:26,404 --> 00:27:27,192
What have we got?

755
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,170
Well, once we
suspected blackmail,

756
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,698
I ran through
his financials again.

757
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:32,832
I thought they were clean.

758
00:27:32,952 --> 00:27:34,960
Well, they were,
but going back, we found this.

759
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,121
He spent 100 grand
on a kitchen Reno.

760
00:27:40,343 --> 00:27:42,684
Totally legitimate,
but we searched his Brownstone--

761
00:27:42,804 --> 00:27:44,921
and he wasn't renovating
his kitchen.

762
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:46,822
So who was on the receiving end
of the 100 grand?

763
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:49,324
Zach Robinson.

764
00:27:49,444 --> 00:27:51,484
Ooh. Good bad-guy name.

765
00:27:51,604 --> 00:27:55,277
Snakey "z," hard "k."
even has "rob" in it.

766
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:56,501
Good bad-guy rap sheet, too.

767
00:27:56,621 --> 00:27:58,054
Former lowlife
private investigator.

768
00:27:58,374 --> 00:27:59,347
I remember this guy.

769
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:01,609
He had some celebrity clients
back in the day.

770
00:28:01,924 --> 00:28:03,324
He was known for
digging up dirt on folks

771
00:28:03,444 --> 00:28:05,007
and turning it into
a personal payday.

772
00:28:05,127 --> 00:28:07,744
He did a nickel on
multiple counts of extortion,

773
00:28:07,864 --> 00:28:10,283
wire tapping, racketeering
and blackmail.

774
00:28:10,403 --> 00:28:11,699
Well, Robinson must have
gotten the picture

775
00:28:11,819 --> 00:28:12,802
from somebody on the inside.

776
00:28:12,922 --> 00:28:14,547
Sure. Figured it was worth
a fast buck.

777
00:28:15,543 --> 00:28:16,947
But if Bobby paid,
why would he kill him?

778
00:28:17,067 --> 00:28:19,362
Bobby figured out that
Robinson was a blackmailer,

779
00:28:19,482 --> 00:28:20,962
and then he threatened
to take him to the cops.

780
00:28:21,082 --> 00:28:22,724
Bobby pushes,
Robinson pushes back harder.

781
00:28:22,844 --> 00:28:24,942
Let's go pick him up.
Easier said than done.

782
00:28:25,062 --> 00:28:27,222
Esposito already ran down
his last known address.

783
00:28:27,342 --> 00:28:28,890
Robinson's in the wind.

784
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:29,986
Well, let's keep looking.

785
00:28:30,106 --> 00:28:31,025
Yeah.

786
00:28:32,292 --> 00:28:34,602
You are a bad man,
Zach Robinson.

787
00:28:35,644 --> 00:28:38,508
A dirty, naughty,
no-good blackmailer.

788
00:28:39,161 --> 00:28:41,219
Do you do all your
interrogations in bed,

789
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:42,256
Detective Heat?

790
00:28:42,376 --> 00:28:43,873
You think this is funny,
Robinson?

791
00:28:43,993 --> 00:28:45,519
Hmm?
Okay, okay.

792
00:28:45,639 --> 00:28:46,840
No, I'll do
whatever you want, Nikki.

793
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,698
Okay. That's more like it.

794
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:51,828
Mm.

795
00:28:53,602 --> 00:28:54,711
Oh.

796
00:28:55,969 --> 00:28:57,755
Mm.

797
00:28:58,876 --> 00:29:01,020
Mm. You are so sweet.

798
00:29:02,557 --> 00:29:03,685
And brilliant.

799
00:29:03,805 --> 00:29:04,411
Guilty.

800
00:29:04,531 --> 00:29:07,380
Mm. What are you thinking?

801
00:29:09,243 --> 00:29:10,049
Nothing.

802
00:29:10,484 --> 00:29:11,310
It's ridiculous.

803
00:29:11,556 --> 00:29:13,651
What? Come on. Tell me.
I want to know what goes on

804
00:29:13,771 --> 00:29:15,523
inside that incredible mind
of yours.

805
00:29:16,737 --> 00:29:18,450
Well, since you put it
that way.

806
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,833
I have this... friend
at work

807
00:29:22,953 --> 00:29:24,792
who thinks that the only reason
you're with me is,

808
00:29:24,912 --> 00:29:25,969
you know...

809
00:29:26,971 --> 00:29:28,337
for the part in the movie.

810
00:29:30,841 --> 00:29:31,642
Wow.

811
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,007
Really?

812
00:29:35,818 --> 00:29:38,177
What does this friend
of yours base that on?

813
00:29:39,928 --> 00:29:41,234
You know what? I'm--
I'm sorry.

814
00:29:41,354 --> 00:29:42,501
I shouldn't
have repeated that.

815
00:29:42,621 --> 00:29:44,251
Does this friend know me?
No.

816
00:29:44,371 --> 00:29:46,678
Has he read anything about me
that would make him think

817
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:49,282
that I would prostitute myself
for a role?

818
00:29:49,402 --> 00:29:51,061
No. Of course not.

819
00:29:51,181 --> 00:29:52,798
You--I--he's an idiot.

820
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:55,262
Do you have any idea
how hard it is

821
00:29:55,382 --> 00:29:57,370
to be a woman in Hollywood?

822
00:30:01,145 --> 00:30:02,217
Ellie.

823
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:03,692
I--

824
00:30:10,129 --> 00:30:11,598
Beckett.

825
00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:15,042
Oh, yeah.

826
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:17,229
He looks like
a Zach Robinson.

827
00:30:17,684 --> 00:30:18,472
Where'd you find him?

828
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:20,750
The boys
caught up with him

829
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:22,388
at a craps table
at Mohegan Sun.

830
00:30:22,734 --> 00:30:25,420
Already gambling away his
hard-earned blackmail money?

831
00:30:26,006 --> 00:30:27,361
So how was your date
with your little starlet?

832
00:30:27,657 --> 00:30:28,877
How can you tell
this time?

833
00:30:29,219 --> 00:30:32,263
Like I said, Castle...
trained Detective.

834
00:30:32,383 --> 00:30:33,285
Well...

835
00:30:34,456 --> 00:30:35,695
It went lovely

836
00:30:35,815 --> 00:30:36,964
no thanks to you.

837
00:30:37,084 --> 00:30:38,200
What did I have to do
with it?

838
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,638
You pulled your
Jedi mind trick on me.

839
00:30:39,967 --> 00:30:41,137
You made me doubt
Ellie's honesty.

840
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:44,477
Foolishly, I told her
what you said, made her cry.

841
00:30:45,253 --> 00:30:47,113
Castle...
She's an actress,

842
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,448
a professional liar.

843
00:30:49,568 --> 00:30:51,111
She's paid to cry on cue.

844
00:30:56,263 --> 00:30:58,097
No.

845
00:30:58,098 --> 00:30:59,564
I've never seen
this picture before.

846
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:00,858
Really?

847
00:31:01,191 --> 00:31:03,557
You sure you didn't use it
to blackmail Bobby Mann?

848
00:31:03,896 --> 00:31:04,722
Blackmail?

849
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:07,050
You're fishing
in the wrong pond, Detective.

850
00:31:07,888 --> 00:31:09,709
What about the 100 grand

851
00:31:09,829 --> 00:31:11,409
from Bobby Mann
in your bank account?

852
00:31:11,816 --> 00:31:13,060
Am I in the right pond now?

853
00:31:14,514 --> 00:31:17,530
That was for...
services rendered.

854
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,197
I don't think Webster's
defines "blackmailing"

855
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:21,696
as a service.

856
00:31:22,286 --> 00:31:25,451
More like a coercive threat,
Mr. Rob-inson.

857
00:31:25,571 --> 00:31:27,816
No, no. No, no.
I never threatened Bobby.

858
00:31:28,402 --> 00:31:29,375
He hired me.

859
00:31:29,495 --> 00:31:30,336
To do what?

860
00:31:34,981 --> 00:31:37,347
My guys say that
you don't have an alibi

861
00:31:37,467 --> 00:31:39,019
for the night that Mann
was murdered.

862
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:40,841
You can't be serious.

863
00:31:40,961 --> 00:31:43,287
I guess it'll come out when
we go to the murder trial.

864
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:45,653
Have a nice life...
sentence.

865
00:31:45,986 --> 00:31:47,969
What? No, no. No, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

866
00:31:48,089 --> 00:31:51,972
Look, he reached out to me.
Said he needed some work done.

867
00:31:52,568 --> 00:31:53,529
What kind of work?

868
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:56,640
The kind that you get paid
a lot extra to do.

869
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,736
Something illegal.

870
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,181
W-well...

871
00:32:01,978 --> 00:32:04,035
Okay, look, he thought that
somebody was out to get him.

872
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:05,168
He said he needed to know,

873
00:32:05,181 --> 00:32:08,289
and so he paid me
to bug a guy's office.

874
00:32:08,855 --> 00:32:09,681
Who?

875
00:32:10,757 --> 00:32:11,841
Howard Weisberg.

876
00:32:11,961 --> 00:32:13,011
The president
of the network?

877
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:15,419
Easy gig, too. Bobby got me
into the building.

878
00:32:16,931 --> 00:32:17,831
When was this?

879
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:18,851
Week ago.

880
00:32:19,073 --> 00:32:20,059
What did you do
with the recordings?

881
00:32:20,179 --> 00:32:22,042
I delivered the cds to Bobby.
When?

882
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:25,324
You know...

883
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,392
The morning
before he died.

884
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:29,399
Bobby's producer said

885
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,617
he locked himself
in his office that morning.

886
00:32:31,737 --> 00:32:33,119
He was listening
to the recordings.

887
00:32:33,239 --> 00:32:35,508
And then they said he
started acting paranoid after that,

888
00:32:35,628 --> 00:32:36,851
so what did he hear?

889
00:32:38,686 --> 00:32:39,955
Am I good to go?

890
00:32:45,719 --> 00:32:47,309
We found the recordings
in Mann's office

891
00:32:47,567 --> 00:32:49,035
mixed in with
his DVD collection.

892
00:32:49,155 --> 00:32:50,267
Heard anything yet
that would explain

893
00:32:50,387 --> 00:32:51,951
why Mann was listening in
on his boss?

894
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:53,991
Nah, just a bunch of talk
about setting up breakfasts,

895
00:32:54,111 --> 00:32:56,836
lunches, dinners and drinks with
writers, actors and directors.

896
00:32:56,956 --> 00:32:57,723
Where are we
on the blackmail?

897
00:32:57,944 --> 00:32:59,953
Oh, we got uniforms
running down all show employees

898
00:33:00,073 --> 00:33:01,925
who could've had access to
the studio to take that photo.

899
00:33:02,045 --> 00:33:04,401
Yo. You guys
are gonna want to hear this.

900
00:33:06,149 --> 00:33:07,394
<i>you know what?</i>
<i>To hell with Bobby Mann.</i>

901
00:33:07,514 --> 00:33:09,513
<i>We're losing money on him</i>
<i>every damn night.</i>

902
00:33:09,633 --> 00:33:11,127
<i>I want him out!</i>
<i>our hands our tied.</i>

903
00:33:11,247 --> 00:33:12,051
<i>You can't fire him.</i>

904
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:14,034
<i>He's got five years left</i>
<i>on his contract.</i>

905
00:33:14,154 --> 00:33:15,340
<i>What if he drops dead, huh?</i>

906
00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:17,636
<i>Seriously. The guy has got</i>
<i>a bad heart.</i>

907
00:33:18,166 --> 00:33:19,755
<i>How hard would it be</i>
<i>to make him go away?</i>

908
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,047
<i>I mean, hell, I got Mickey reed</i>
<i>telling me every day,</i>

909
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:23,366
<i>he's ready to step in</i>

910
00:33:23,486 --> 00:33:26,122
<i>If we could just get Bobby Mann</i>
<i>out</i> <i>the damn door.</i>

911
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,824
Well, no wonder Bobby thought
Mickey was disloyal.

912
00:33:28,944 --> 00:33:30,956
And no wonder he thought
someone wanted him dead.

913
00:33:31,572 --> 00:33:32,359
Someone did.

914
00:33:33,577 --> 00:33:35,450
<i>What if he drops dead, huh?</i>

915
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:37,076
<i>Seriously. The guy</i>
<i>has got a bad heart.</i>

916
00:33:37,717 --> 00:33:39,220
<i>How hard would it be</i>
<i>to make him go away?</i>

917
00:33:40,611 --> 00:33:42,089
Looks like you got your wish,
Mr. Weisberg.

918
00:33:43,341 --> 00:33:44,228
Detective,
none of the recordings

919
00:33:44,348 --> 00:33:45,288
are admissible in court.

920
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,234
Oh, relax, Burt.
I didn't kill anyone, okay?

921
00:33:47,354 --> 00:33:48,599
Save it for when
I actually do.

922
00:33:48,719 --> 00:33:51,716
Detective, I wasn't serious.
Bobby thought you were.

923
00:33:51,836 --> 00:33:53,626
Well, then maybe he shouldn't
have been bugging my office.

924
00:33:53,746 --> 00:33:56,780
Hell, in private, I issue
a dozen death sentences a day

925
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,874
on underperforming, overpaid
jackasses at my network.

926
00:33:59,994 --> 00:34:02,954
Now what I wanted was
Mickey Reed pulled to 11:30.

927
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:05,668
But Bobby had an $80-million
penalty on his contract.

928
00:34:05,788 --> 00:34:08,043
Which still had another
five years left on it.

929
00:34:08,163 --> 00:34:11,862
Yeah. Now what I did was
lean on Bobby for a few months

930
00:34:11,982 --> 00:34:13,199
to appeal
to a younger audience.

931
00:34:13,319 --> 00:34:16,415
But the worst thing that I did
was threaten to fire him

932
00:34:16,535 --> 00:34:17,634
and pay him the $80 mil.

933
00:34:17,754 --> 00:34:21,702
Mr. Weisberg where were you
between 1:30 and 4:30 A.M.

934
00:34:21,822 --> 00:34:22,944
the night of the murder?

935
00:34:23,064 --> 00:34:25,162
You don't have to answer that.
It's fine, Burt. Chill out.

936
00:34:25,282 --> 00:34:27,215
I was at the Essex House Hotel.

937
00:34:27,335 --> 00:34:28,336
Were you with anyone?

938
00:34:28,456 --> 00:34:29,577
As a matter of fact I was.

939
00:34:30,465 --> 00:34:31,746
This actress I was screwing

940
00:34:31,866 --> 00:34:33,459
wanted a part
on one of my sitcoms.

941
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:35,061
I met her after Bobby's show.

942
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,488
I'm gonna need a name.

943
00:34:37,894 --> 00:34:39,989
Sure. Ellie Monroe.

944
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,229
Thank you for coming by
Ms. Monroe.

945
00:34:48,475 --> 00:34:49,530
Of course.

946
00:34:58,301 --> 00:34:59,714
Weisberg's alibi...

947
00:35:00,884 --> 00:35:01,796
Is good.

948
00:35:02,439 --> 00:35:03,859
Oh, go on.
You can say it.

949
00:35:04,541 --> 00:35:05,506
"I told you so."

950
00:35:05,984 --> 00:35:07,770
No, thanks. I'm actually
not in the gloating mood.

951
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,456
His alibi sets us
back to square one...

952
00:35:11,287 --> 00:35:13,862
Which means we have no idea
who the blackmailer is

953
00:35:13,982 --> 00:35:16,313
And we don't know why Mann
went to the comedy club

954
00:35:16,433 --> 00:35:18,344
and trashed
Angel Santana's bike.

955
00:35:19,072 --> 00:35:20,316
And we have no idea
who the killer is.

956
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:22,492
Well, the good news is,
I can work all night.

957
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,769
No plans.

958
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,068
You know, it's late,
and I'm kinda tired.

959
00:35:28,691 --> 00:35:29,861
How about we pick this up
in the morning?

960
00:35:30,612 --> 00:35:31,450
All righty, then.

961
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,545
And the boys'll be
back on duty tomorrow,

962
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,009
to coin a phrase...

963
00:35:36,899 --> 00:35:38,477
Which would be inaccurate...

964
00:35:39,625 --> 00:35:41,757
because you are not a boy.

965
00:35:43,348 --> 00:35:44,937
Is this some kind of
a weird come-on?

966
00:35:44,938 --> 00:35:47,217
I think I know what Bobby Mann
was doing at that comedy club.

967
00:35:47,337 --> 00:35:49,231
I think I know why he thought
he was an awful person.

968
00:35:49,351 --> 00:35:51,744
And... I think I know
who killed him.

969
00:35:51,864 --> 00:35:53,240
Mr. McPhee?

970
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:55,558
Ah.

971
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,001
I was just going over
my notes for the tribute.

972
00:35:59,473 --> 00:36:00,989
35 years of friendship--

973
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,891
It's kinda hard to find
just the right story to tell.

974
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,744
What can I do for you?

975
00:36:06,255 --> 00:36:07,487
We just came by
to give you this.

976
00:36:07,607 --> 00:36:09,126
Bobby's idea book--
we thought you might like it.

977
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:13,760
Thanks.
We did have a question about
what he wrote on the last page.

978
00:36:14,663 --> 00:36:17,377
"the boys'll be back on duty
tomorrow night."

979
00:36:17,497 --> 00:36:18,658
Actually,
he crossed out "boys"

980
00:36:18,778 --> 00:36:20,799
and wrote "gang, posse"
and "crew."

981
00:36:21,914 --> 00:36:22,850
Any idea why?

982
00:36:24,928 --> 00:36:25,913
I guess we'll never know.

983
00:36:26,345 --> 00:36:27,651
I wouldn't be too sure
about that.

984
00:36:27,771 --> 00:36:30,175
The network was pressuring
Bobby to make a change.

985
00:36:30,295 --> 00:36:32,109
They threatened to cancel him
unless he did.

986
00:36:32,229 --> 00:36:33,033
And the night
that he was murdered,

987
00:36:33,153 --> 00:36:36,048
he told Barbara that
something awful was going on.

988
00:36:37,238 --> 00:36:38,692
He asked her
if he was a good person.

989
00:36:38,812 --> 00:36:39,776
Why would he say that?

990
00:36:40,133 --> 00:36:41,624
Because of Kayla.

991
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,109
Not Kayla, Hank.

992
00:36:45,229 --> 00:36:46,132
Because of you.

993
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,522
He knew
that he had to fire you.

994
00:36:48,642 --> 00:36:50,877
He knew he needed to find
someone younger and hipper

995
00:36:50,997 --> 00:36:52,060
if he was gonna survive.

996
00:36:52,664 --> 00:36:54,068
Someone like Angel Santana.

997
00:36:54,352 --> 00:36:56,434
Weisberg confirmed that she was
on the network's short list.

998
00:36:56,554 --> 00:36:58,127
That's why it wasn't "boys"
anymore, Hank.

999
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:00,275
'cause Angel's a girl.

1000
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:03,158
This is ridiculous.
Bobby would never fire me.

1001
00:37:03,405 --> 00:37:05,388
Then why did you kill him?
I didn't.

1002
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:07,103
We ran your credit cards,
Hank.

1003
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,702
The night that he was murdered,
you went

1004
00:37:09,822 --> 00:37:11,994
to a 24-hour grocery store
and bought two things--

1005
00:37:12,114 --> 00:37:14,000
Cranberry juice
and balsamic vinegar.

1006
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,736
It's time stamped.
1:56 A.M.

1007
00:37:17,185 --> 00:37:18,717
And I'm betting
if we test your keys,

1008
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:20,799
we'll find metal from
Angel Santana's motorcycle

1009
00:37:20,919 --> 00:37:22,635
where you scratched in
"late-night bitch."

1010
00:37:30,363 --> 00:37:31,599
He told me...

1011
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,477
that night just before
he left the studio...

1012
00:37:36,657 --> 00:37:38,443
how he'd heard Weisberg say

1013
00:37:38,563 --> 00:37:40,525
they were gonna bury him
unless he made a change.

1014
00:37:42,698 --> 00:37:44,595
35 years, I had his back.

1015
00:37:44,715 --> 00:37:46,470
He was gonna toss me aside
like one of his ex-wives,

1016
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,726
humiliate me in front of
the whole country.

1017
00:37:50,236 --> 00:37:52,901
I knew it was coming.
I saw all the little signs,

1018
00:37:53,201 --> 00:37:55,038
the awkward moments
in the hall.

1019
00:37:55,716 --> 00:37:57,946
I sent him that picture
of him and Kayla

1020
00:37:58,066 --> 00:38:00,015
to remind him
of all the secrets I kept.

1021
00:38:01,081 --> 00:38:02,153
You know what he said?

1022
00:38:02,896 --> 00:38:05,039
The scandal would only
help his ratings.

1023
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,763
You bought your poison

1024
00:38:07,046 --> 00:38:08,660
and you followed him
to the club.

1025
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,865
I confronted him
when he came out.

1026
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:13,587
I told him not to throw away
everything we'd built.

1027
00:38:14,085 --> 00:38:15,576
He told me
he couldn't save me.

1028
00:38:15,822 --> 00:38:18,385
Weisberg was going younger
with or without him.

1029
00:38:18,899 --> 00:38:21,154
Well, if you knew he didn't have
a choice, why did you kill him?

1030
00:38:21,573 --> 00:38:23,224
Because he did have
another choice.

1031
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:25,470
Go down with the ship!

1032
00:38:25,778 --> 00:38:27,539
We both go out gracefully,

1033
00:38:27,858 --> 00:38:30,100
and Bobby
gets 80 million bucks

1034
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:33,151
instead of him continuing
the show with some kid.

1035
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:38,333
I gave him
over 4,000 shows,

1036
00:38:38,966 --> 00:38:41,080
laughing at every lousy joke
he cracked,

1037
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,970
whether they were funny
or not.

1038
00:38:44,669 --> 00:38:46,603
Jeez.

1039
00:38:46,604 --> 00:38:48,268
So how did you manage it?

1040
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:53,042
When I knew
I couldn't change his mind,

1041
00:38:53,043 --> 00:38:54,710
I told him...

1042
00:38:54,711 --> 00:38:56,511
I understood.

1043
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,303
We walked over
to the West Side highway,

1044
00:38:59,281 --> 00:39:01,942
sat on a bench,
looked out at the water,

1045
00:39:02,689 --> 00:39:04,993
talked about
what a great run we'd had.

1046
00:39:07,854 --> 00:39:09,331
Then I offered him a drink.

1047
00:39:11,255 --> 00:39:12,721
He was my best friend.

1048
00:39:14,361 --> 00:39:15,778
You don't do that
to your friend.

1049
00:39:20,052 --> 00:39:21,481
Yet another example of

1050
00:39:21,601 --> 00:39:23,637
why you shouldn't mix
business with pleasure,

1051
00:39:24,205 --> 00:39:25,436
even show business.

1052
00:39:25,556 --> 00:39:27,494
Are you talking about the case
or yourself?

1053
00:39:28,011 --> 00:39:29,909
Yeah.

1054
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,410
Touché, Detective.

1055
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:32,858
So you want to go
for a victory lap

1056
00:39:32,978 --> 00:39:33,737
and grab a burger?

1057
00:39:33,958 --> 00:39:36,188
Oh, can't. Gotta go.
Big date.

1058
00:39:36,533 --> 00:39:37,322
You're kidding, right?

1059
00:39:37,442 --> 00:39:39,055
You're going out with
Ellie Monroe even though

1060
00:39:39,175 --> 00:39:41,494
you know the only reason
that she was interested in you

1061
00:39:41,614 --> 00:39:42,678
was for a part?

1062
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:45,618
Have you lost
all sense of human decency

1063
00:39:45,738 --> 00:39:47,897
and self-res--what?

1064
00:39:48,871 --> 00:39:51,480
My big date...
is with Alexis.

1065
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,587
She's getting back
from her trip.

1066
00:39:55,657 --> 00:39:56,322
Oh.

1067
00:40:04,576 --> 00:40:09,146
♪

1068
00:40:13,951 --> 00:40:15,805
Right on time, Alexis.

1069
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,658
Oh, Sacagawea...

1070
00:40:18,778 --> 00:40:19,975
has returned!

1071
00:40:21,138 --> 00:40:23,327
And you are not
Sacagawea,

1072
00:40:23,447 --> 00:40:24,978
but come in.

1073
00:40:25,098 --> 00:40:26,037
Thanks.

1074
00:40:28,462 --> 00:40:29,484
I'm headed back to L.A.

1075
00:40:29,604 --> 00:40:32,650
and I just wanted to...
say sorry.

1076
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:35,982
Thanks.
But the truth is,

1077
00:40:36,102 --> 00:40:38,165
I've never had so much fun
being used.

1078
00:40:38,285 --> 00:40:40,148
You feel free
to have at me anytime.

1079
00:40:40,268 --> 00:40:42,851
Well, I guess you'll rescind
your recommendation of me

1080
00:40:42,971 --> 00:40:44,715
to your producers, and that
is the least I deserve--

1081
00:40:44,835 --> 00:40:46,858
No, Tony thinks you are
great for it, and so do I.

1082
00:40:47,191 --> 00:40:49,082
You are a better actress
than I thought

1083
00:40:49,083 --> 00:40:50,169
when I recommended you.

1084
00:40:50,587 --> 00:40:52,490
Well, you should know, I wasn't
acting the whole time.

1085
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:54,744
Me neither.

1086
00:40:55,722 --> 00:40:56,744
Thanks, Rick.

1087
00:40:57,985 --> 00:40:58,993
Take care.

1088
00:40:59,444 --> 00:41:00,294
You, too.

1089
00:41:00,414 --> 00:41:01,414
Bye.

1090
00:41:02,095 --> 00:41:03,175
Hi.

1091
00:41:03,749 --> 00:41:04,525
Dad, was that--

1092
00:41:04,645 --> 00:41:06,304
My Sacagawea
has returned!

1093
00:41:06,424 --> 00:41:08,620
Oh, my God. My best girl.
I missed you so much.

1094
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:10,313
Oh, my God.
I'm so glad you're home.

1095
00:41:10,433 --> 00:41:11,792
I missed you, too, dad.

1096
00:41:13,826 --> 00:41:15,058
You're not just saying that,
are you?

1097
00:41:15,178 --> 00:41:16,249
What--
No, don't.

1098
00:41:17,252 --> 00:41:18,700
Tell me you're hungry.
I'm starving.

1099
00:41:18,701 --> 00:41:20,968
Come with me.
Tell me everything.
I will.
