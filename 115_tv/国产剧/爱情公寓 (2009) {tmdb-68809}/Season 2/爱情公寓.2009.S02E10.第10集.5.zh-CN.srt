1
00:00:04,313 --> 00:00:05,212
Why do people say that New York is such a tough town?

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:06,779
I've lived here a while now,

3
00:00:06,848 --> 00:00:08,014
and I feel like I've got it licked.

4
00:00:08,082 --> 00:00:09,482
I mastered the subway,

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,084
how to jaywalk without being hit,

6
00:00:11,152 --> 00:00:12,886
and I've learned a cute new word for Jewish people.

7
00:00:12,954 --> 00:00:15,188
Hello, Hebraham!

8
00:00:15,256 --> 00:00:16,689
The thing that really makes the city feel like home

9
00:00:16,757 --> 00:00:18,158
is having a friend,

10
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:20,460
someone to talk to and hang out with.

11
00:00:20,527 --> 00:00:22,394
And for me, that's my roommate Chloe.

12
00:00:25,165 --> 00:00:27,766
One day soon, we'll even be in a picture together.

13
00:00:27,834 --> 00:00:29,668
Hmm.

14
00:00:32,072 --> 00:00:33,238
Hey, Eli.

15
00:00:33,306 --> 00:00:34,406
Do you stand there every morning,

16
00:00:34,474 --> 00:00:35,474
waiting for me to open the blinds?

17
00:00:36,943 --> 00:00:38,376
Don't flatter yourself, June. And yes, I do.

18
00:00:38,444 --> 00:00:39,810
Look at that!

19
00:00:39,878 --> 00:00:42,113
One time I mention to Chloe that blueberry is

20
00:00:42,181 --> 00:00:43,781
my favorite kind of yogurt, and what does she do?

21
00:00:43,849 --> 00:00:45,950
She goes and stocks the entire fridge with them.

22
00:00:46,018 --> 00:00:47,938
Well, it's important to have friends in New York.

23
00:00:47,987 --> 00:00:49,553
This city can be hard...

24
00:00:49,621 --> 00:00:51,055
like a lot of things.

25
00:00:51,123 --> 00:00:52,523
I feel bad.

26
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:54,391
I've been so busy working at the coffee shop

27
00:00:54,459 --> 00:00:56,026
and trying to get another wall street job

28
00:00:56,094 --> 00:00:58,195
that I haven't been able to have a girls' day out with Chloe...

29
00:00:58,262 --> 00:00:59,662
until now !

30
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,598
That sounds fun. You know what's not fun?

31
00:01:01,665 --> 00:01:04,801
Complacency in the face of corporate greed.

32
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:06,736
Today is my first day off,

33
00:01:06,804 --> 00:01:09,005
so I think I'm gonna ask her to hang out.

34
00:01:09,072 --> 00:01:11,673
Maybe we'll go have a picnic in Central Park or...

35
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,277
Stop talking!

36
00:01:15,345 --> 00:01:17,480
Oh, hey! Somebody's up.

37
00:01:17,547 --> 00:01:19,148
Would you like to hang out today?

38
00:01:19,216 --> 00:01:21,750
I feel like a pig crapped inside my head.

39
00:01:21,818 --> 00:01:25,086
I feel like a pig ate Indian food and squatted down...

40
00:01:25,154 --> 00:01:27,989
Oh. There's a man underneath you.

41
00:01:28,057 --> 00:01:29,090
Hello.

42
00:01:29,158 --> 00:01:30,325
Don't wake him.

43
00:01:30,393 --> 00:01:32,693
I took all of his life force last night.

44
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:35,296
All right, come on. I wanna see your New York City.

45
00:01:35,364 --> 00:01:37,932
Show me what you love about this place.

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,501
Well...

47
00:01:39,568 --> 00:01:40,868
guess there is one thing we could do,

48
00:01:40,936 --> 00:01:43,003
but it might be a little touristy.

49
00:01:43,071 --> 00:01:44,471
And to your left,

50
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:46,973
you'll see the site of the famous noodle fire of 1927,

51
00:01:47,042 --> 00:01:48,522
They say on a windy night,

52
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:51,611
you can still smell the lo mein and burning hair.

53
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:53,680
God, I love New York!

54
00:01:53,748 --> 00:01:58,016

55
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:06,125
And that's all they found...

56
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:10,329
the young nurse's sawed-off pelvis in a FedEx envelope

57
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:11,864
in that mailbox right there. 

58
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:15,467
When you absolutely, positively have to be dead overnight," huh?

59
00:02:17,136 --> 00:02:19,137
Mitchell, you are too much!

60
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:21,073
New York!

61
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,408
Here, we laugh at death! 

62
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,976
Don't laugh too hard, little girl.

63
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:26,445
Another young woman

64
00:02:26,512 --> 00:02:27,946
was found murdered in the park this morning.

65
00:02:28,013 --> 00:02:29,646
That makes six this summer. You wanna call her parents

66
00:02:29,714 --> 00:02:31,682
and tell them how funny you think that is?

67
00:02:31,749 --> 00:02:33,917
We... we were just... we all were just laughing...

68
00:02:33,985 --> 00:02:35,553
Okay, who's up for snacks and a pee?

69
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,954
Okay.

70
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:38,322
I've got cliff bars and tuna fish sandwiches.

71
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:42,193
Warning... the ice has made the bread moist.

72
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,329
I actually brought my snack from home.

73
00:02:46,397 --> 00:02:47,663
Blueberry yogurt.

74
00:02:47,731 --> 00:02:49,265
My favorite.

75
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,634
Great. It's time for my snack, too.

76
00:02:51,702 --> 00:02:52,935
I should probably do it in the bathroom, though.

77
00:02:53,003 --> 00:02:55,271
There's a lot of cops around.

78
00:02:55,339 --> 00:02:57,307
Welcome, murder fans!

79
00:02:57,374 --> 00:03:00,076
You must be here for our killer zucchini muffins.

80
00:03:00,144 --> 00:03:02,010
It's a joke.

81
00:03:02,078 --> 00:03:05,914
So this is what you're doing on your day off? A crime tour?

82
00:03:05,982 --> 00:03:07,516
It's what Chloe wanted to do.

83
00:03:07,584 --> 00:03:09,985
How great. So the roommate who slept with your fianc?
 84 00:03:10,052 --> 00:03:11,853 is also fascinated with murder?

84
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:13,455
Perfect!

85
00:03:13,523 --> 00:03:14,884
There's a problem in the bathroom.

86
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,791
Someone tried to flush some kind of plastic baggie

87
00:03:16,826 --> 00:03:17,958
down your toilet.

88
00:03:18,026 --> 00:03:19,660
Ohh!

89
00:03:19,728 --> 00:03:23,297
So today was, uh... it was interesting.

90
00:03:23,132 --> 00:03:24,598
Right?! 

91
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:25,699
Before I took that tour, I didn't know any of that stuff.

92
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:27,235
I didn't know it!

93
00:03:27,303 --> 00:03:28,903
Well, you know another fun thing for girlfriends to do together

94
00:03:28,971 --> 00:03:31,072
is to have a home-cooked meal.

95
00:03:31,173 --> 00:03:34,774
Wednesday night, I'll make my famous chicken Williams.

96
00:03:34,809 --> 00:03:37,477
Yeah Wednesday works. It's a plan.

97
00:03:37,545 --> 00:03:38,979
Okay. 

98
00:03:39,047 --> 00:03:41,681
Toilets are for pees and turds, you guys.

99
00:03:41,749 --> 00:03:44,384
Why do I have to say this every day?

100
00:03:50,223 --> 00:03:52,658
Mark-Paul Gosselaar is building a school in El Salvador.

101
00:03:52,725 --> 00:03:54,160
What an ass crack.

102
00:03:54,227 --> 00:03:56,595
Hmm! Escuela de Gosselaar.

103
00:03:56,663 --> 00:03:58,764
He looks good, all wearing a tank top.

104
00:03:58,831 --> 00:04:00,599
Yeah, swing that hammer,

105
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:02,334
build that school,

106
00:04:02,402 --> 00:04:04,036
carry that niño. I'm telling you,

107
00:04:04,103 --> 00:04:06,838
the best way to get publicity is to do something selfless.

108
00:04:06,906 --> 00:04:10,075
Uh-huh. How do you say "safe word" in Spanish?

109
00:04:10,143 --> 00:04:11,576
Palabra segura.

110
00:04:11,644 --> 00:04:13,011
So I called my agent,
