1
00:00:05,818 --> 00:00:08,764
为啥我总是什么都找不到...
How come that I can never find anything...

2
00:00:08,764 --> 00:00:10,292
因为你太邋遢了 阿朱
Because you're a slob, June.

3
00:00:10,498 --> 00:00:12,425
因为你老是乱糟糟的...
because you are a disorganized...

4
00:00:12,425 --> 00:00:14,160
哇哦! 饺子!
Ooh! Dumpling.

5
00:00:17,263 --> 00:00:18,631
克洛伊?
Chloe?

6
00:00:22,568 --> 00:00:23,703
克洛伊?
Chloe?

7
00:00:25,182 --> 00:00:26,173
克洛伊?
Chloe?

8
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,160
干嘛?
What?!

9
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:30,546
有声音
I heard something.

10
00:00:30,546 --> 00:00:32,845
废话! 你一直在叫"克洛伊! 克洛伊!"
Yeah! You screaming "Chloe! Chloe!"

11
00:00:32,845 --> 00:00:34,247
声音还那么大!
at the top of your lungs!

12
00:00:36,315 --> 00:00:37,383
啥玩意?
What was that?

13
00:00:38,742 --> 00:00:40,192
惊喜!
Superise!

14
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,501
警报! 入侵! 警报! 入侵!
Nuts! Nose! Nuts! Nose!

15
00:00:42,089 --> 00:00:43,257
泰迪!
Teddy!

16
00:00:43,257 --> 00:00:45,660
没错就是我! 她听到的声音是我发出来的
It was me. I was the noise she was hearing.

17
00:00:46,072 --> 00:00:47,239
泰迪是谁?
Who is Teddy,

18
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:49,075
为什么这有个房间 我从来没见过?
and w-what is this room that I've never seen before?

19
00:00:49,175 --> 00:00:50,576
这是第三个卧室
Oh, that's our third bedroom.

20
00:00:50,576 --> 00:00:51,477
我把它当壁橱用的
I use it as my closet.

21
00:00:51,477 --> 00:00:54,246
我们小时候 泰迪和我一起
And Teddy and I went to psychopath camp together

22
00:00:54,246 --> 00:00:55,581
参加过神经病夏令营!
when we were kids!

23
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:57,690
阿朱 我没跟你说过这个壁橱
June, I didn't tell you about the closet,

24
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,826
我不该瞒着你的
and that's a big thing to keep from somebody.

25
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:00,994
抱歉
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:01,142 --> 00:01:02,510
见到你真是太高兴了!
It's so good to see you!

27
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:03,363
我要狠狠地抱你下!
I'm gonna give you a back crack!

28
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,600
抱! 抱!
Back crack! Back crack!

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,249
# 我并不完美 不打小报告 #
I'm not perfect, I'm no snitch

30
00:01:08,249 --> 00:01:11,142
# 但要告诉你 她是个... #
but I can tell you she's a...

31
00:01:16,787 --> 00:01:18,955
这一整个房间都用来放衣服?
This whole room is for your clothes?

32
00:01:18,955 --> 00:01:22,099
我还把套装塞在防火梯那边的垃圾袋里
I keep my suits in a trash bag on the fire escape.

33
00:01:23,164 --> 00:01:24,102
麻冷者夏令营
Camp C.U.T.S.

34
00:01:24,102 --> 00:01:27,003
麻冷者代表"麻木冷酷的幸存者"
it stands for "Callous Unemotional Trait Survivors."

35
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:27,889
你还留着这件汗衫?
You kept the shirt?

36
00:01:27,889 --> 00:01:28,745
我当然留着啦
Of course I kept the shirt.

37
00:01:28,745 --> 00:01:29,894
我太爱那里了
I loved it there.

38
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:31,316
我们一起唱营歌吧?
Should we sing her the camp song?

39
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,931
我们乃是正常孩童
We are normal children.

40
00:01:35,931 --> 00:01:37,476
我们不会虐待动物
We don't torture animals.

41
00:01:37,476 --> 00:01:39,980
尊重治疗师 好好吃下药
Respect your therapist. Take your meds.

42
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,811
我们的痛苦终将消失
Our pain is hopefully finite.

43
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:43,474
我妈妈把我送去麻冷者夏令营的
My mom sent me to camp C.U.T.S.

44
00:01:43,474 --> 00:01:45,724
因为她觉得我无法表达感情
Because she thought I had trouble expressing any emotion.

45
00:01:45,724 --> 00:01:47,109
我对此没有任何感想
I had no reaction to that.

46
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:49,161
我妈妈送我去是因为我对我哥做的事
And my mom sent me because of what I did to my brother.

47
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:50,656
你对你哥哥做了什么?
What'd you do to your brother?

48
00:01:51,251 --> 00:01:53,044
每年 泰迪都会停一段药
So every year, Teddy goes off his meds,

49
00:01:53,044 --> 00:01:55,673
到镇上来参加卡特沼泽商店大甩卖
and he comes to town for the Carter Marsh warehouse sale.

50
00:01:55,673 --> 00:01:58,385
不嗑药的泰迪真是人才
Unmedicated Teddy is exactly what I need to help

51
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:00,472
我要他帮忙赶走那些从康乃狄克州驾车
fend off the vicious women from Connecticut

52
00:02:00,472 --> 00:02:02,521
远道而来参加年度最大甩卖的坏女人
who S.U.V. In for the biggest sale of the year.

53
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:04,073
你听到了么 阿朱
Can you hear them, June,

54
00:02:04,073 --> 00:02:05,127
她们磨枪擦剑
preparing for battle,

55
00:02:05,127 --> 00:02:06,481
准备战斗的号角声?
sharpening their fingernails?

56
00:02:10,147 --> 00:02:11,865
我想买这条裙子
This is the dress that I want.

57
00:02:11,874 --> 00:02:15,092
平时零售价四千美元
Retail value is $4,000.

58
00:02:15,092 --> 00:02:16,767
现在只要399美元
They'll mark it down to $399.

59
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:19,101
那儿只有一件 而且店家会把它藏起来
They'll only have one, and they'll hide it...

60
00:02:19,101 --> 00:02:20,242
但我会找到它的
but I'll find it.

61
00:02:20,242 --> 00:02:21,379
那泰迪做什么?
What does Teddy do?

62
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:23,184
他为我扫清道路 开辟战场
He clears a path and erects a force field.

63
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:25,045
我很强悍 阿朱 但我需要一位战士
I'm tough, June, but I need a warrior...

64
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:26,147
悍勇无畏的战士
someone with no fear.

65
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:27,608
你已经无所畏惧了
You were the fearless one.

66
00:02:27,608 --> 00:02:29,434
你把吴小姐从冰淇淋车里面推出来
You pushed Miss.Wu out of the ice cream truck

67
00:02:29,434 --> 00:02:30,515
还用汽水浇了我们一身
and threw us all bomb pops.

68
00:02:30,515 --> 00:02:32,011
吴小姐动作太慢了 必须得推她出来
Wu was slow. She had to be pushed.

69
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:34,980
天哪! 那个夏令营太棒了 真可惜不在了
God! That camp was the best. It's so sad that it's gone.

70
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,049
怎么回事?
What happened to it?

71
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:37,181
- 被烧掉了 - 关门了
- It burned down. - Closed.

72
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:46,863
你现在怎么样?有几个男人围着你转啊?
And so what about you? How many guys in your rotation?

73
00:02:46,863 --> 00:02:48,030
七个
Seven.

74
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,419
但只有一个她真心喜欢!
But she only loves one!

75
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,408
阿朱 闭嘴!
June, shut up!

76
00:02:50,408 --> 00:02:53,475
- 真的? 那人谁? - 那人叫班吉b
- She does? Who is he? - His name is Benjamin.

77
00:02:53,475 --> 00:02:55,564
他导演了部佳作 由詹姆斯出演
He directed a wonderful movie that James was in

78
00:02:55,564 --> 00:02:57,065
叫做"爱的怪怪"
called "Love Monster."

79
00:02:57,065 --> 00:02:59,067
- 从没听过 - 他们在万圣节认识
- Never heard of it! - They met on Halloween,

80
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:01,169
她自认为戏耍了班吉b
and she thought she was playing a trick on him,

81
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:02,871
事实正相反
but it turned out he was playing a trick on her,

82
00:03:02,871 --> 00:03:05,140
在机场他们演了出狗血剧
and they had a romantic scene at the airport

83
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,528
此后再没联系过
and they haven't talked to each other since.

84
00:03:07,558 --> 00:03:09,618
不好意思 你上衣里边是什么?
Excuse me. What is going on under your top?

85
00:03:09,618 --> 00:03:11,531
呃 是件泳衣
It's a, uh, it's a bathing suit.

86
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:12,834
啊! 恶魔!
Aah! Devil!

87
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:14,840
干嘛? 最近工作太忙了
What? It's been really crazy at work,

88
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,455
我没时间洗衣服了
and I haven't had time to do laundry.

89
00:03:16,455 --> 00:03:18,516
阿朱 如果你想和我们一起去大甩卖
June, if you wanna come with us to the warehouse sale,

90
00:03:18,516 --> 00:03:20,180
我也愿意为你而战
I'd be happy to block for you, too.

91
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,295
你人真好 泰迪
That's very sweet, Teddy,

92
00:03:21,295 --> 00:03:24,073
但我不需要买新的漂亮内衣
but I don't need any new fancy underwear.

93
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,297
阿朱 要是因为穿泳衣得了尿路感染
June, you deserve that urinary tract infection

94
00:03:27,297 --> 00:03:28,487
纯属活该
that bathing suit's giving you.

95
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:37,945
你说我们能以贵宾身份进来 我没料到是这样
When you said we had a VIP access, I pictured the exact opposite of this.

96
00:03:37,945 --> 00:03:40,181
不勘探战地 怎能上战场 詹姆斯
You can't go to war if you don't know the battlefield, James.

97
00:03:40,573 --> 00:03:41,840
这场大甩卖唯一的好处
the only good thing about this sale

98
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,878
就是它让旗舰店变成了世外桃源
is the xanadu it creates at the flagship store.

99
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:45,134
当你们这些女人在这里大战的时候
While you guys are here battling it out,

100
00:03:45,134 --> 00:03:47,428
我在住宅区安静地享受购物时光
I will be uptown shopping in peace.

101
00:03:48,118 --> 00:03:49,427
我还要去看看比克牌牛仔裤卖得怎么样
I'll even check in on how the Beek jeans are selling.

102
00:03:49,427 --> 00:03:50,903
一般我就帮基佬小情侣
I usually end up signing a couple pairs

103
00:03:50,903 --> 00:03:52,278
在裤子上签点名
for young homosexual tourists.

104
00:03:52,369 --> 00:03:55,086
快看! 那边就是康乃狄克团
Oh, look! There they are, the Connecticut crew,

105
00:03:55,086 --> 00:03:56,865
还因为拼车过来大汗淋漓着呢
still all sweaty from the carpool ride in.

106
00:03:56,865 --> 00:03:58,941
带头儿的还真是够放纵自己的啊
Oh, the ringleader's really let herself go.

107
00:03:59,331 --> 00:04:01,295
嘿 海瑟 嗨!
Hey, Heather! Hi!

108
00:04:01,295 --> 00:04:02,605
你胖死了
You're fat!

109
00:04:03,114 --> 00:04:05,337
- 克洛伊 那个女的怀孕了 - 我知道
- Chloe, that woman is with child. - I know.

110
00:04:05,654 --> 00:04:06,797
嘿 海瑟!
Hey, Heather!

111
00:04:06,797 --> 00:04:10,028
祝你周六时能顺利把肥臀挪过来
Good luck dragging your fat ass around here on Saturday.

112
00:04:10,028 --> 00:04:11,961
我的名字叫绯斯
My name is Faith,

113
00:04:12,412 --> 00:04:14,001
我还知道他们把这件藏哪儿了
and I know just where they'll stash it.

114
00:04:14,001 --> 00:04:15,161
我的裙子!
Oh! My dress.

115
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:16,926
我去把她们轮胎放掉气
I'm gonna go flatten their tires.

116
00:04:16,926 --> 00:04:17,926
詹姆斯 你最近怎么样?
So,James, what's up with you?

117
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:23,087
为了某个电视剧试映 我和海伦・亨特
Uh, I passed on a chemistry read with Helen Hunt

118
00:04:23,087 --> 00:04:24,354
一起读了点化学资料
for some TV pilot.

119
00:04:24,354 --> 00:04:25,797
嗯哼 还有呢?
Uh-huh. What else?

120
00:04:26,465 --> 00:04:28,777
我二表姐简妮特爱上我了
My second cousin Janet is in love with me.

121
00:04:28,777 --> 00:04:30,759
她抱我的方法很有问题
Her hugs remain wildly inappropriate.

122
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:33,054
嗯哼 还有呢?
Uh-huh. What else?

123
00:04:34,685 --> 00:04:36,034
你干嘛不直接问我?
Why don't you just ask me?

124
00:04:36,421 --> 00:04:37,520
问你什么?
Ask you what?

125
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,890
班吉b怎么样
How Benjamin's doing.

126
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,107
班吉b谁啊?
Who Benjamin?

127
00:04:40,107 --> 00:04:41,917
克洛伊 你们明明彼此喜欢
Chloe, you guys obviously like each other.

128
00:04:41,917 --> 00:04:43,124
你们自从万圣节后还没讲过话呢
You haven't talked since halloween.

129
00:04:43,124 --> 00:04:44,231
你为什么不打给他?
Why don't you just call him?

130
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:46,643
要我来主动? 没门
And be the first one to make the second move? No way.

131
00:04:46,643 --> 00:04:49,200
克洛伊 你喜欢他 别玩了
Chloe, you like this guy. Stop playing games.

132
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,825
他不在纽约 可我肯定他愿意听....
He's out of town, but I'm sure he would love to hear...

133
00:04:50,825 --> 00:04:52,783
- 实战演练 - 噢!
- Practice drill! - Oh!

134
00:04:52,783 --> 00:04:54,067
该死 詹姆斯!
Damn it, James!

135
00:04:54,067 --> 00:04:56,886
别再用臭班吉b让我分心了
Stop distracting me with your weird Benjamin obsession!

136
00:04:56,886 --> 00:04:57,815
我需要专注!
I have to focus!

137
00:04:57,815 --> 00:04:59,818
这是我人生最重要的一周
This is the most important week of my life.

138
00:05:00,784 --> 00:05:01,638
约翰・古德曼?!
John Goodman?!

139
00:05:01,638 --> 00:05:04,230
约翰・古德曼在贵宾通道吗?
is John Goodman at the V.I.P. Walk-Through?

140
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,620
不 那只是海瑟
Oh! No, that's just Heather.

141
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,848
只是海瑟罢了 各位!
It's just Heather, everyone!

142
00:05:07,848 --> 00:05:10,645
不用拍照 也不用凑过来签名啦
No autographs. Don't run up to her with a pen.

143
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:13,081
这人可没演"罗斯安家庭生活"
This person was not on "Roseanne."

144
00:05:16,325 --> 00:05:18,098
稍等片刻! 去下洗手间!
Be right back! Gotta use the ladies'!

145
00:05:21,644 --> 00:05:23,843
烦人的泳衣
Frickin' bathing suit.

146
00:05:26,677 --> 00:05:28,660
我可没时间管你啊
I do not have time for this.

147
00:05:30,451 --> 00:05:31,804
该死!
damn it!

148
00:05:34,423 --> 00:05:35,189
我入伙了
I'm in.

149
00:05:35,687 --> 00:05:36,976
我要去大甩卖
I wanna go to that sale.

150
00:05:37,322 --> 00:05:39,333
好! 要谨记...
Yay! Okay, just remember...

151
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,515
头发扎起来 紧身衣穿上
Hair in a bun, no loose clothing.

152
00:05:41,515 --> 00:05:42,404
为什么?
Why?

153
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:46,409
弱点! 弱点! 弱点!
Access point! Access point! Access point!

154
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:48,743
啊! 你不知道这是夹上的嘛!
Ow! You didn't know those were clip-Ons!

155
00:05:48,743 --> 00:05:49,564
- 弱点! - 啊!
- Access point! - Ow!

156
00:05:49,564 --> 00:05:51,551
- 弱点! 弱点!  - 知道啦!

00:05:58,269 --> 00:05:59,365
班吉b!
Benjamin!

159
00:06:00,646 --> 00:06:02,215
你来看我啦
You came to see me.

160
00:06:03,026 --> 00:06:04,945
那就证明是你先主动的哦
That means you made the first second move.

161
00:06:05,238 --> 00:06:07,371
呃 抱歉 我不是来看你的
Uh, no. Sorry, I'm not here to see you.

162
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:10,095
我来给小詹送惊喜礼物 在意大利买的呢
I'm here to surprise jimbo with a gift I bought him in Italy.

163
00:06:10,095 --> 00:06:11,011
你给我买礼物了?
You got me a present?

164
00:06:11,011 --> 00:06:13,760
可你认为我先主动联系了
But you thinking I made the first second move

165
00:06:14,113 --> 00:06:16,190
用实际行动证明你先主动了
is actually you making the first second move.

166
00:06:18,184 --> 00:06:19,088
什么?
Uh, what?

167
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:19,868
不 我...
No, I...

168
00:06:19,868 --> 00:06:21,884
班吉b 我是泰迪 泰迪 真高兴见到班吉b
Benjamin, Teddy. Teddy, Benjamin.

169
00:06:21,884 --> 00:06:24,340
- 克洛伊和我 - 他是阿朱的男朋友!
- Chloe and I went to... -  He's June's boyfriend!

170
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:25,860
他... 他刚想说
He was... He was gonna say,

171
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,394
"克洛伊和我是...阿朱的男朋友"
"Chloe and I went... to June's boyfriend."

172
00:06:31,842 --> 00:06:33,492
摸摸这 摸摸这
hoke hoke

173
00:06:35,574 --> 00:06:36,875
亲爱的 放松点
Relax honey.

174
00:06:43,485 --> 00:06:45,690
阿朱 我要你假装和泰迪约会
June, I need you to pretend to date Teddy.

175
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,281
要是班吉b知道我太多往事
If Benjamin knows too much about me,

176
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,312
他会用那些爆料伤害我
he'll just use it against me as ammunition...

177
00:06:49,312 --> 00:06:50,825
就跟你跟我说你尿床后
The same way you told me you used to wet the bed,

178
00:06:50,825 --> 00:06:52,527
我都把你叫尿尿龙一样
and now I refer to you as "Pee Dragon."

179
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:55,656
你要让我和你那个停了药的疯子朋友
You're asking me to pretend-date your mentally unstable friend

180
00:06:55,656 --> 00:06:57,012
假装约会
who is currently off his meds.

181
00:06:57,012 --> 00:06:59,574
拜托 阿朱 那是泰迪 他没事的
Come on! June, it's Teddy. He's fine.

182
00:07:03,368 --> 00:07:04,879
我为你而来 伊莱
I'm coming for you, Eli.

183
00:07:04,951 --> 00:07:06,134
放马过来吧 泰迪
Bring it, Teddy.

184
00:07:06,424 --> 00:07:08,154
看吧? 伊莱喜欢他
See? Eli loves him.

185
00:07:08,154 --> 00:07:10,616
求你了 阿朱? 求你了求你了嘛
Please, June? Please? Please? Please? Please? Please? Please?

186
00:07:10,616 --> 00:07:13,115
既然你承认我说的对
Well. Since you are basically admitting that I'm right

187
00:07:13,115 --> 00:07:14,364
也像我期待一般深爱班吉b 那我... 
and you love Benjamin as much as I want you to, I... 

188
00:07:14,365 --> 00:07:15,281
泰迪!
Teddy!

189
00:07:17,392 --> 00:07:19,276
你要假装和尿尿龙约会了
You have to pretend to date  "Pee Dragon"

190
00:07:19,276 --> 00:07:20,043
我能带面具吗?
Can I wear a Mask?

191
00:07:20,043 --> 00:07:20,865
- 不行 - 那成了
- No. - I'm in.

192
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:26,061
- 不行 - 嘿 这里怎么样啊?
- No. - Hey. What's going on in here?

193
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:28,392
呃 我们只是在...
Uh, we w-we were just, uh...

194
00:07:28,392 --> 00:07:29,938
在摸胸
we're boob-feeling.

195
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,892
让我们四人约会吧
Let's all go on a double date.

196
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,294
克洛伊
Chloe,

197
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:35,676
你朋友让我们四人约会
your friend just suggested a double date...

198
00:07:35,676 --> 00:07:37,504
他们刚和你在厨房悄悄讲小话
Your friend you've been whispering with

199
00:07:37,504 --> 00:07:39,726
是不是证明你想和我出去呀
here in the kitchen. You wanna go out with me.

200
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:42,121
不 我不想 我其实不想让你去
No, I don't. I actually don't want you to go.

201
00:07:42,727 --> 00:07:45,031
我可不会因为你不想我就不去
Well, I'm not gonna not go because you don't want me to.

202
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:48,658
我也不会因为你不想让我去 我就不去
Well, I'm not going to not go because you don't want me to.

203
00:07:49,273 --> 00:07:50,253
阿朱 我们去哪?
June, where are we going?

204
00:07:50,253 --> 00:07:51,413
不不 别告诉他们
I-- No, don't tell them yet.

205
00:07:51,413 --> 00:07:52,890
别告诉他们 不要嘛
W-- don't tell them yet. No.

206
00:07:57,555 --> 00:08:00,517
这个小电影已经席卷全球了吧
That little movie's taken over the world, huh?

207
00:08:00,517 --> 00:08:01,410
是啊
Yep.

208
00:08:03,174 --> 00:08:05,320
我到现在还挑牙齿的粉毛毛呢
I think I'm still picking pink fur out of my teeth.

10209
00:08:07,222 --> 00:08:09,274
那好 小詹詹
so, jim jimbo

210
00:08:09,932 --> 00:08:10,707
你最近怎么样啊?
what's going on with you?

211
00:08:10,707 --> 00:08:13,397
我新装了个浴盆
I, uh, just got a new bidet installed.

212
00:08:13,397 --> 00:08:15,097
嗯哼 还有呢?
Uh-huh. What else? Yeah.

213
00:08:15,097 --> 00:08:16,567
我前几天和送信的姑娘狠打了一架
I had a crazy fight with my mail lady the other day.

214
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:17,774
还有呢?
Uh-huh. What else?

215
00:08:17,774 --> 00:08:20,258
你为什么不直接问我?
Why don't you just ask me?

216
00:08:21,117 --> 00:08:21,992
问你什么?
Ask you what?

217
00:08:22,904 --> 00:08:24,296
克洛伊最近怎么样啊
What's going on with Chloe.

218
00:08:24,736 --> 00:08:25,535
我有点厌倦夹在
I'm tired of being in the middle

219
00:08:25,535 --> 00:08:26,812
你俩中间了
of your guys' relationship.

220
00:08:26,812 --> 00:08:29,213
什么? 我们俩又没在一起
W-What? W-We're not in a relationship.

221
00:08:29,213 --> 00:08:30,277
得了吧 别玩了
Come on, stop the games.

222
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:33,219
听着 克洛伊不擅长主动
Listen, Chloe's not good at making the first move,

223
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:34,757
尤其是对心动对象
Especially if it's in the right direction.

224
00:08:35,687 --> 00:08:37,877
所以单刀直入咯 她也会的
But just cut the nonsense, and she will, too.

225
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,860
我保证
I promise you.

226
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,698
你是说...
You mean, just...

227
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:43,599
认真的?
be real?

228
00:08:43,776 --> 00:08:45,928
我知道听起来很傻 可是管用
I know it sounds crazy, but it works.

229
00:08:46,341 --> 00:08:47,373
就像拍电影
It's like in the movie,

230
00:08:47,698 --> 00:08:49,623
当我看那些老套怪兽的时候
when I had to look past all the monster stereotypes

231
00:08:49,623 --> 00:08:51,486
我只挑了普林可
and just see plinko for plinko.

232
00:08:55,432 --> 00:08:57,770
你真会选 哥们
you know how to choose an incredible friend

233
00:08:58,691 --> 00:08:59,416
谢了
Thank you.

234
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:00,605
不客气
Any time.

235
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,467
当然他会迟到了 耀武扬威嘛
Of course he's late. It's a power move.

236
00:09:08,467 --> 00:09:11,221
我人模人样穿戴好坐着等他 就是个白痴
And I'm sitting here with my hand up my dress like a jerk.

237
00:09:11,826 --> 00:09:14,082
为什么我们来这么早? 才五点啊
Why are we here so early? It's only 5:00.

238
00:09:14,082 --> 00:09:16,125
我还不饿呢 午饭还没消化
I'm not hungry yet. I still feel lunch.

239
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,688
因为我们必须八点半上床睡觉
Because we have to go to bed at 8:30.

240
00:09:17,688 --> 00:09:20,661
明早六点必须准时到仓库里
We need to be at the warehouse at 6:00 a.m. Sharp.

241
00:09:21,577 --> 00:09:22,559
泰迪在哪?
Where's Teddy?

242
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:25,020
这是我们的 我们先坐下来的
This is ours. We were seated first,

243
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,846
可你却先有了面包 不公平
but you got bread first, and that's not fair.

244
00:09:32,162 --> 00:09:33,381
我爱你
I love you.

245
00:09:33,381 --> 00:09:34,944
好嘞 好嘞
Oh. Okay. Okay.

246
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:36,014
谢谢你
Thank you.

247
00:09:38,263 --> 00:09:39,104
高招嘛
Well played.

248
00:09:39,104 --> 00:09:41,865
故意来晚 显示权威
Showing up late, establishing your dominance.

249
00:09:41,865 --> 00:09:44,245
不玩了 克洛伊 我去你家
No more games, Chloe. I came by your apartment

250
00:09:44,245 --> 00:09:46,496
是想给你惊喜 不是詹姆斯
because I wanted to surprise you, not James.

251
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,071
其实我在洛杉矶还推掉了一场重要会议
Actually...  I blew off big meeting I had in l.A.

252
00:09:50,071 --> 00:09:51,599
因为我想过来看你
Because I wanted to come here and see you

253
00:09:52,846 --> 00:09:54,188
因为我想你
because I missed you.

254
00:09:56,747 --> 00:09:57,526
什么情况?
What's happening?

255
00:09:58,524 --> 00:10:01,047
我看他只是实话实说罢了
I-I think he's just being honest with you.

256
00:10:02,742 --> 00:10:04,860
也许你也...也该这样?
Maybe you can-- you can do the same?

257
00:10:14,301 --> 00:10:15,939
我跟泰迪有一腿
I'm having an affair with Teddy.

258
00:10:15,939 --> 00:10:16,998
什么?
What?

259
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:19,637
阿朱 实在抱歉以这种方式通知你
June, I'm really sorry you had to find out this way.

260
00:10:19,872 --> 00:10:22,458
如果你想大哭一场 厕所里就有张沙发
If you need to have an ugly cry, there's a Couch in the bathroom.

261
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:25,772
克洛伊 我一直对你都非常坦诚
Uh, Chloe, I was just totally honest with you,

262
00:10:25,772 --> 00:10:27,045
我没有...
so I don't get--

263
00:10:27,045 --> 00:10:28,072
你没有什么?
what don't you get?

264
00:10:28,072 --> 00:10:31,050
我和泰迪有一腿 阿朱马上就要大哭一场
I'm having an affair with Teddy, and June's about to ugly cry.

265
00:10:31,341 --> 00:10:33,169
阿朱 让他看看你的哭腔
Come on, June, give them a little preview.

266
00:10:33,503 --> 00:10:34,158
就像...
It's like...

267
00:10:35,504 --> 00:10:37,733
我这么可爱怎么学得像呢
I can't do it because I'm too cute.

268
00:10:38,226 --> 00:10:39,262
泰迪 走吧
Teddy, let's go.

269
00:10:49,287 --> 00:10:52,382
嘿! 我在彻底检查明日战鞋的性能
Hey!  I'm testing out my shopping heels for tomorrow.

270
00:10:52,634 --> 00:10:54,618
- 你到底在搞什么? - 怎么了?
- What the hell was that? - What?

271
00:10:54,618 --> 00:10:56,896
班吉b终于对你说了实话
Benjamin was finally being honest with you,

272
00:10:56,896 --> 00:10:59,270
而你却对他撒了弥天大谎?
and you tell him this big, huge lie?

273
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,557
他说 "别再玩了"的时候
Well, the second he said "No more games,"

274
00:11:01,557 --> 00:11:02,579
我瞬间觉得很无聊
I got instantly bored.

275
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,489
我发现 这就是我喜欢的他唯一理由
I realized that's the only reason I was into him,

276
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:05,592
所以 我放弃了
so I got out of it.

277
00:11:05,592 --> 00:11:06,975
我才不相信呢
I don't believe you.

278
00:11:07,128 --> 00:11:09,710
他终于对你说了实话
I think he finally started being honest with you,

279
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,497
但你却害怕了 所以拒绝了他
and you got scared and you bailed.

280
00:11:11,665 --> 00:11:13,829
就像现在这样 你在逃跑
That's what you do. You run.

281
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:14,923
我才没有
No, I don't.

282
00:11:14,923 --> 00:11:17,460
泰迪 你能跟她讲讲理吗?
Teddy, will you please talk some sense into her?

283
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,176
你也知道 我不太喜欢伊莱
As you can see, I don't really like Eli.

284
00:11:19,176 --> 00:11:21,356
你干什么 泰迪兄? 扔我的煎饼吗?
What are you gonna do, Tedford? Flip my pancakes?

285
00:11:21,356 --> 00:11:23,297
祝你拥有十尺长的胳膊!
Hope you have 10-Foot long arms!

286
00:11:23,297 --> 00:11:25,478
不许叫我"泰迪熊"
Stop calling me "Tedford."

287
00:11:25,478 --> 00:11:26,890
别再暗恋他了
Stop secretly Loving it!

288
00:11:27,575 --> 00:11:29,485
顺便说一句 我们得晚餐在这了
These are our full dinners, by the way.

289
00:11:29,485 --> 00:11:31,667
我和班吉b聊得很不开心
I had to have a very uncomfortable chat with Benjamin

290
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:32,607
所以把晚餐全打包了
as they were boxed up.

291
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,804
她当真? 这只是一场游戏吗?
I mean, is she serious? Is this a game?

292
00:11:35,804 --> 00:11:38,240
我 我不知道 我真的不知道
Yeah, I-I don't know.  I don't know.

293
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,529
嗨 你能...你能把面包也装起来吗?
Hi. Um, can you just--can you just wrap up this bread for us

294
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:42,533
- 快点? 谢谢 - 没问题
- really quickly? Thank you. - Sure.

295
00:11:42,533 --> 00:11:44,802
对不起 能再多给我们一点
And also I'm sorry. Can we have, um, a little extra dressing

296
00:11:44,802 --> 00:11:46,901
这么点就可以了 谢谢
in, like, in a little one of these? Thank you. Yeah.

297
00:11:46,901 --> 00:11:49,326
能给我们一堆叉子吗?
And can we--can we have a bunch of forks?

298
00:11:50,111 --> 00:11:51,594
很多叉子
Too many forks. Yeah.

299
00:11:52,202 --> 00:11:54,467
我不知道 我不知道
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know.

300
00:11:55,034 --> 00:11:56,447
随便
Okay, Well, whatever.

301
00:11:56,447 --> 00:11:59,082
我们明天早晨六点整就得起床
We have to be up tomorrow at 6:00 a.M. Sharp.

302
00:11:59,633 --> 00:12:01,037
你不能抗拒自己的感觉
You can't avoid your feelings,

303
00:12:01,037 --> 00:12:03,300
就想我没办法抗拒春卷一样!
just like I can't avoid the spring rolls!

304
00:12:03,471 --> 00:12:06,290
春卷太好吃了 他们还送了酱油
'cause they're delicious and they gave me soy sauce

305
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,873
我真是太高兴了
and I'm so happy.

306
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,481
快起床! 我们迟到了!
Wake up! We're late!

307
00:12:18,481 --> 00:12:20,798
闹钟定了下午 不是上午!
I did p.m. Instead of a.m.!

308
00:12:20,798 --> 00:12:23,489
起床了! 我去叫出租车
wake up! I'm gonna go get a cab.

309
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:28,710
今日要大战康乃狄克州人!
it's a bad day to beat for Connecticut!

310
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:39,354
你觉得把闹钟定错时间
Do you think maybe it is possible you set your alarm wrong

311
00:12:39,354 --> 00:12:41,069
可能是因为满脑子班吉b吗?
Because you were thinking about Benjamin?

312
00:12:41,069 --> 00:12:42,533
阿朱 别开玩笑了!
June, don't be ridiculous!

313
00:12:42,704 --> 00:12:44,581
泰迪 清空通道!
Teddy, clear the entrance!

314
00:12:44,856 --> 00:12:46,161
这边! 开始了!
This way! Go time!

315
00:12:46,588 --> 00:12:50,234
我是说 昨晚你可能受到了影响
I'm just saying, maybe last night had an effect on you.

316
00:12:50,234 --> 00:12:52,066
闭嘴! 闭嘴! 我都没和那男人上过床
Shut up! Shut up! This is way too much talking

317
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:53,695
你说的太多了!
about a guy I haven't even had sex with!

318
00:12:53,695 --> 00:12:56,177
我们都没接过吻 除了万圣节开玩笑那次
We haven't even kissed, except for a part of a halloween trick.

319
00:12:56,177 --> 00:12:59,107
你甚至没有真正接过吻 你就这么喜欢他?
You haven't even real kissed, and you like him this much?

320
00:12:59,107 --> 00:13:00,057
更证明你爱他!
Further proof of love!

321
00:13:00,057 --> 00:13:01,637
要不是我们迟到了 天哪
If we weren't late, so help me god,

322
00:13:01,637 --> 00:13:03,376
我会转过身 把你推下楼梯!
I would turn around and push you down this flight of stairs!

323
00:13:03,376 --> 00:13:05,439
这次先记在账上!
I owe you one push down one flight of stairs!

324
00:13:14,903 --> 00:13:16,985
距衣架还有三分钟! 快走!
Three minutes to rack! Let's go!

10325
00:13:24,224 --> 00:13:25,366
救命
Help me

326
00:13:29,652 --> 00:13:30,692
更衣室在哪儿?
Where are the changing rooms?

327
00:13:30,692 --> 00:13:32,848
你在浪费宝贵时间!
You're wasting precious time!

328
00:13:35,973 --> 00:13:37,800
天啊 这些人真疯狂
Oh, my gosh. These people are crazy.

329
00:13:41,246 --> 00:13:42,861
我还穿着呢!
I'm still wearing it!

330
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:47,196
下去! 下去!
Aah! Go down! Go down!

331
00:13:50,892 --> 00:13:51,829
您喝茶吗?
Tea?

332
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:54,582
不用 谢谢了
Um, no. No. Thank you.

333
00:13:54,582 --> 00:13:55,918
你知道吗?
Actually, you know what?

334
00:13:55,971 --> 00:13:57,843
我还是喝点茶吧
I will have some tea.

335
00:14:00,213 --> 00:14:02,058
真漂亮
This is nice. Ooh!

336
00:14:02,247 --> 00:14:03,796
真可爱
This is lovely.

337
00:14:10,065 --> 00:14:13,102
我今天什么都拿不到! 我到底是怎么了!
Ah! I can't get anything today! What is wrong with me?!

338
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,381
是班吉b!
it's Benjamin!

339
00:14:14,871 --> 00:14:16,826
你喜欢班吉b!快滚!
You like Benjamin! Get away! Mm!

340
00:14:17,168 --> 00:14:19,529
我要买吗? 原价是八百刀 减到四十五
Should I get this? It's $800, marked down to $45.

341
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:20,686
- 当然! - 好的
- Yes! - Okay.

10342
00:14:22,614 --> 00:14:24,635
我扭伤了膝盖!
I strained my knees!

343
00:14:24,635 --> 00:14:27,256
- 你还好吗? - 声东击西! 谁派你来的?!
- Oh, no. Are you okay? - Diversion tactic! Who sent you?!

344
00:14:27,256 --> 00:14:28,444
我的祖母!
My grandmother!

345
00:14:28,444 --> 00:14:30,195
- 她到底想要什么?! - 那件夹克衫!
- What does she want?! - that jacket!

346
00:14:30,195 --> 00:14:31,405
别做梦了!
Never!

347
00:14:33,616 --> 00:14:36,609
- 专心! - 我正在努力!
- Focus! - Aah! I'm trying!

348
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,095
我正在努力!
I'm trying!

349
00:14:38,373 --> 00:14:39,341
海瑟?
Heather?

350
00:14:39,752 --> 00:14:42,694
我今天抢到了两个宝贝衣服
I'm getting two precious babies today.

351
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:45,687
我把广告册忘了 把你的给我!
I forgot my reference photo. Give me yours!

352
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:54,446
我家衣服在哪块?
Where's my boutique?

353
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,639
您说什么?
Excuse me?

354
00:14:55,663 --> 00:14:56,779
比克牛仔时装
The Beek jeans boutique.

355
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:58,743
你移到商店前面去了吗?
Did you move it to the front of the store?

356
00:14:59,872 --> 00:15:01,182
范德・比克先生...
Oh, Mr. Van der Beek...

357
00:15:01,595 --> 00:15:02,524
他们畅销过一阵
They were selling really well,

358
00:15:02,524 --> 00:15:05,268
但续订时定的太多...
but then we just reordered too many, and...

359
00:15:05,748 --> 00:15:07,113
所以 减价卖给了
they've been remaindered...

360
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,397
商场大甩卖
to the warehouse sale.

361
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,493
不会吧
No

362
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,266
你在做什么?!
What are you doing?!

363
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,662
这次真不错
It's nice day provided

364
00:15:23,662 --> 00:15:27,082
还能在这个地方 歇歇脚松口气
with this great chill-out corner just to relax and unwind and--

365
00:15:27,082 --> 00:15:29,154
不不不! 这可不是你们歇脚的地方!
No, no, no! This isn't-- this isn't a place to relax!

366
00:15:29,154 --> 00:15:30,658
这里也有战斗
This is--Fight here, too!

367
00:15:30,658 --> 00:15:32,608
这些牛仔裤都特别好 你们想买的
Come on, these are great jeans. You want these.

368
00:15:32,608 --> 00:15:34,858

Look, she's got em. Now she's got 'em!

369
00:15:35,621 --> 00:15:38,334
啊! 绯斯? 绯斯?
Aah! Faith? Faith?

370
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:41,965

I'm looking for a woman who's just given birth? Faith?

371
00:15:41,965 --> 00:15:43,260
你在找这些!
You're looking for these!

372
00:15:45,633 --> 00:15:46,626
你知道吗?
Did you know about this?

373
00:15:46,714 --> 00:15:48,319
我家牛仔裤被廉价出售了...
We've been remaindered. Uh...

374
00:15:48,612 --> 00:15:51,667
女士 你知道... 她在流鼻血
madam, can I interest you in a p--Her nose is bleeding.

375
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:53,685
她流鼻血了 她居然不在乎
Her nose is bleeding. She didn't even care.

376
00:15:56,761 --> 00:15:59,059
班吉b又打我电话了
Okay, this is Benjamin calling me again.

377
00:15:59,248 --> 00:16:00,030
你对他做了什么?
What did you do to him?

378
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,118
- 我才不关心 - 她骗人!
- I don't care. - Don't let her fool you!

379
00:16:02,184 --> 00:16:04,395
这是我的! 她很在乎!
Mine! She does care!

380
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,969
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

381
00:16:28,277 --> 00:16:31,031
- 把衣服给我! - 你给我松手!
- Aah! Give it to me! - Let go of it!

382
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,590
- 做梦! - 你这么胖! 你都穿不上!
- No! - You're not even a size zero! You can't even wear this!

383
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:36,876
我今早刚生完孩子 我无所不能
I had a baby this morning. You have no idea what I can do.

384
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:38,121
泰迪!
Teddy!

385
00:16:38,121 --> 00:16:41,307
绯斯? 跟我回医院给孩子喂奶
Faith? Come back to the hospital and breastfeed our baby.

386
00:16:41,307 --> 00:16:43,170
去休息区等着 克莱格!
Go wait in the relaxation corner, Craig!

387
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,587
那不是休息区!
It's not a relaxation corner!

388
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,958
是比克牛仔专卖区 比克牛仔耐穿又时尚
They're Beek jeans, and they're both durable and stylish.

389
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:47,697
我来了!
Incoming!

390
00:16:47,697 --> 00:16:48,769
泰迪 快帮忙!
Teddy, help me!

391
00:16:49,471 --> 00:16:51,095
抢到手了!
Ah! Yes!

392
00:16:51,095 --> 00:16:53,044
他妈的太棒了! 太棒了!
Damn yes! Yes!

393
00:16:53,044 --> 00:16:54,563
该死的!
Oh, god. Uhh!

394
00:16:54,939 --> 00:16:56,558
我到底是怎么了?
What is wrong with me?

395
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,098
她很弱的
She was weak.

396
00:16:58,321 --> 00:17:01,340
我本可以对她... 拳打脚踢
I could've... bitten her or scratched her

397
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,804
或是直接生挠硬拽
or just pushed her and kicked her.

398
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:04,702
我知道她的弱点在哪
I know she has tender areas now.

399
00:17:05,304 --> 00:17:07,040
从来没有我抢不到的衣服
I never let a dress go.

400
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,042
也许是因为你有
Maybe that's because

401
00:17:08,042 --> 00:17:10,020
比那件衣服更想要得到的东西
there's something you want more than that dress,

402
00:17:10,244 --> 00:17:12,569
比如说班吉b 我熟悉你这种眼神
like Benjamin. I know that look in your eyes.

403
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:15,604
七年级时我一想到艾伦・德迈亚 我就这样
I had that same look in Seventh grade over Aaron Demayo.

404
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:17,946
一堆妞等着做他女朋友
His schedules never lined up.

405
00:17:18,685 --> 00:17:20,413
# 麻冷者夏令营 #
Camp C.U.T.S. 

406
00:17:20,642 --> 00:17:21,601
# 让你卸下心防＃
Let your guard down

407
00:17:21,601 --> 00:17:24,744
看他轻而易举的解开数学题和科学题
I saw him briefly on the stairs on the way to math and science.

408
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:27,246
# 情绪十分美妙 #
Emotions are good

409
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,901
一整天我都心不在焉
but I'd spend the rest of the day distracted,

410
00:17:29,901 --> 00:17:31,037
一直在想他...
thinking about him...

411
00:17:31,037 --> 00:17:33,717
# 人类都会改变 #
people Can change

412
00:17:33,717 --> 00:17:34,248
# 不管报告如何 #
 despite what all the research says

413
00:17:34,249 --> 00:17:36,017
总犯低级错误 写错字啊
making easy mistakes like spelling "Separate" Wrong...

414
00:17:37,047 --> 00:17:38,489
# 人类总能改变 # 
people can change

415
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,109
家政课上标错火腿名称啊
or, you know, mismarking a hem in home ec.

416
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,375
# 人类总能改变 # 
# People can change #

417
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,799
这都是喜欢一个人的征兆 克洛伊
that's what happens when you like somebody, Chloe.

418
00:17:48,515 --> 00:17:49,526
倒霉
Crap.

419
00:17:58,198 --> 00:17:59,308
嗨
Hi.

420
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:00,705
你来这干什么?
What are you doing here?

421
00:18:01,109 --> 00:18:02,513
我骗了你
I lied to you.

422
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:04,693
我没有在和泰迪约会
I'm not having an affair with Teddy,

423
00:18:04,693 --> 00:18:06,186
阿朱也没有
and June's not dating him.

424
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:06,994
这一切都是我编的
I made all that up

425
00:18:06,994 --> 00:18:09,329
为了隐瞒我和泰迪是老朋友
so I could hide how Teddy and I really know each other.

426
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,154
我们一起去过神经病夏令营
We went to psychopath camp together.

427
00:18:12,866 --> 00:18:13,662
什么地方?
What?

428
00:18:13,877 --> 00:18:15,090
通常
Which, usually,

429
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:18,032
我会自豪的告诉那些大街上碰到的陌生人
I'll proudly tell any stranger I meet on the street,

430
00:18:18,032 --> 00:18:20,024
但我没跟你说...
but I didn't tell you...

431
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:26,241
因为我很清楚 我在乎你对我的看法
Because clearly, I care what you think about me.

432
00:18:27,619 --> 00:18:29,465
我是说 我很在乎
I mean, clearly I do.

433
00:18:29,465 --> 00:18:31,602
看看我在大甩卖里抢到了什么
Look how I did at the warehouse sale.

434
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,065
那是什么?
What is that?

435
00:18:33,065 --> 00:18:36,228
暖腿套和铁锹杰克的工具包
A leg warmer and a dopp kit from Jack spade.

436
00:18:36,228 --> 00:18:37,930
一团糟
I failed.

437
00:18:38,814 --> 00:18:40,168
都是你的错
And it's all your fault

438
00:18:40,168 --> 00:18:42,363
因为很显然 我喜欢你
because, obviously, I really like you.

439
00:18:42,363 --> 00:18:45,462
是啊 说的对 是很明显
Uh, Yeah. Yeah, obviously.

440
00:18:45,462 --> 00:18:48,279
你昨晚在餐馆向我吐露心声时
Well, when you got all honest with me at the restaurant,

441
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:50,292
我惊慌失措 事情就变成这样了
I freaked out, and it became this whole thing,

442
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:52,637
然后阿朱穿着泳衣大吃了一顿
and then June ate a lot of food in a swimsuit.

443
00:18:53,069 --> 00:18:55,345
但是一想到再也见不到你了...
But the thought of not seeing you again...

444
00:18:58,155 --> 00:18:59,405
在过去的几个月里
In just these past few months

445
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:01,592
我看到了很多事情 想要和你分享
I saw so many things I wanted to tell you about.

446
00:19:01,592 --> 00:19:03,279
我看到了患妥瑞症的送信员
I saw a bike messenger with tourette's,

447
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:06,041
争论坐哪班地铁回住宅区的瘾君子
two junkies arguing about which subway to take uptown.

448
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,275
争论琐事的瘾君子
Junkies arguing over mundane things

449
00:19:08,275 --> 00:19:10,208
是我最喜欢的纽约一角

450
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,666
我知道! 我也是!
I know! Mine, too!

451
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:14,771
克洛伊 我才不在乎你小时候去过神经病夏令营
Chloe, I don't care that you went to crazy camp as a kid.

452
00:19:15,132 --> 00:19:17,466
你会在乎我参加过减肥营吗?
God, do you care that I went to fat camp?

453
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:20,079
很多次还是只有一次 还是...
You mean, like, for a lot of summers or just one or...

454
00:19:25,209 --> 00:19:26,524
你吻起来真像个胖小子
You kiss like a fat kid.

455
00:19:26,524 --> 00:19:28,486
你吻起来真像个疯子
You kiss like a crazy person.

456
00:19:29,061 --> 00:19:33,210
# 啊 啊 啊 #
# Ahh, ahh, ahh #

457
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:35,626
不会吧!
No!

458
00:19:38,117 --> 00:19:40,467
这些都是比克牛仔裤?
are those all Beek jeans?

459
00:19:40,467 --> 00:19:43,372
是的 我知道为什么没人疯抢我的牛仔裤了
Yeah. I figured out why people weren't fighting over my jeans.

460
00:19:43,372 --> 00:19:45,475
不是牛仔裤的问题 是我的问题
It's not the jeans' fault. It's my fault.

461
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,413
瞧 我设计了一款全球最棒的牛仔裤
See, I let a great pair of jeans out in the world

462
00:19:47,413 --> 00:19:49,329
却没有设计能搭配的衬衫还有腰带
without a great shirt and a belt to set them off.

463
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:51,013
所以我要开创一条完整的服装生产线
So I'm gonna start a whole clothing line

464
00:19:52,195 --> 00:19:53,514
就叫经典潮流比克
called le Beek chic C'est Beek.

465
00:19:53,787 --> 00:19:55,034
名字我还想着呢
I'm still working on the name.  Mm-hmm.

466
00:19:55,034 --> 00:19:57,577
耶! 你们俩在一起啦!
Yay! You're together!

467
00:19:57,577 --> 00:19:58,540
没有
No.

468
00:19:59,138 --> 00:20:02,081

470
00:20:05,272 --> 00:20:07,712

471
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,155
阿朱 你买的什么

474

泰迪太给力了
And Teddy was amazing.

475
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:21,824
哦! 他睡着了
Oh! He's asleep.

476
00:20:21,824 --> 00:20:24,126
一定是新药发挥药效了
His new meds must have kicked in.

477

再见了 营友 明年见了
