00:01:34,925 --> 00:01:37,450
Episode Forty-five

2
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,420
There is someone inside.

3
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,420
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

4
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,140
So she is the beautiful slave

5
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,660
Mister Tian prepared for me.

6
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:54,980
Inside the closet,

7
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,660
there is a beautiful woman.

8
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,500
In bed,

9
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,100
there is an ugly shrew.

10
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,500
Any man will feel

11
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,860
it is such a pity.

12
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,980
So you are a man?

13
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,140
Why did I heard

14
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,500
the Guards of Yue outside

15
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,820
saying that you haven’t touched women for years

16
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,860
and are going to be a monk?

17
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,220
If you insult me with words again,

18
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,060
I shall show you

19
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,740
whether I am a real man.

20
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,140
Rascal.

21
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,260
Where are you going?

22
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,260
I am leaving.

23
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,060
No way.

24
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,700
Let go of me.

25
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,700
No way.

26
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,460
Your Young Master.

27
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,220
Young Master, are you still awake?

28
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,780
Mister Tian, it’s late.

29
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,340
Where are you here?

30
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,340
His Young Master Wei Shuye is here.

31
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,540
He wants to meet you.

32
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,340
How about this.

33
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,980
You entertain him for me.

34
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,500
I am a little

35
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,620
tired now.

36
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,180
Yes, sir.

37
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,260
I got it.

38
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,180
Rest assure.

39
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,380
I shall take

40
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,020
good care of him.

41
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,780
Young Master,

42
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,700
enjoy your lovely night.

43
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,980
I shall excuse myself now.

44
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,220
After Her Highness went back to Chang’an,

45
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,180
she ordered to arrest you.

46
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,260
She wants to kill you.

47
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,140
You knew

48
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,900
Wei Shuye has fancies Her Highness since he was a child.

49
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,380
Why did he come here

50
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,620
out of the blue?

51
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,860
He is here to catch you.

52
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,660
Why didn’t you escape

53
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,460
and still sit here, enjoying the food?

54
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,260
Didn’t you say that

55
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,700
Wei Shuye is outside

56
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,740
to catch me?

57
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,660
If I escape now,

58
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,860
I will definitely be caught.

59
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,900
I have a question for you.

60
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,740
Why did you

61
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,180
come here so suddenly?

62
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,180
I don’t have any money. I wanted to steal some.

63
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,380
Looks like you are going to need a lot of money.

64
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,580
Yanbei is

65
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,700
very poor.

66
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,060
If you don’t steal enough money,

67
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,175
you may starve to death.

68
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,780
Your Young Master Wei.

69
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,580
He is still asleep?

70
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,300
I don’t know whether

71
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,620
His Young Master is up or not.

72
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,500
I heard he

73
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,460
catches a cold.

74
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,740
I happen to have some medicine.

75
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,500
Your Young Master Wei. Please wait.

76
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,060
I heard that

77
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,300
he went inside to take a rest

78
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,380
before sunset.

79
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,100
It’s noon right now.

80
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,540
He should be up by now.

81
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:14,940
Since when Yuwen Yue becomes

82
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,060
so lazy?

83
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,740
It’s not just

84
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,300
my Young Master inside.

85
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,260
I am curious that

86
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,820
what kind of woman

87
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,220
can make him fall in love

88
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,740
so deeply.

89
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,180
Please wait here, Your Young Master Wei.

90
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,780
Your Young Master.

91
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,020
Brother Wei came here so late last night,

92
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,700
but you got up this early.

93
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,660
You really are a hard working person.

94
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,540
I am following the imperial decreed. I need to be cautious.

95
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,540
Good for you.

96
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,500
Mister Tian is going to give me

97
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,460
a banquet later.

98
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,020
Are you coming?

99
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,580
Of course.

100
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,100
Right.

101
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,420
I heard you got a

102
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,780
beautiful woman last night.

103
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:09,820
You two got along very well.

104
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,140
Why don’t you bring her with you

105
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:11,940
to the banquet?

106
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,140
让我好好开开眼

107
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,260
OK.

108
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,260
It’s easier to escape at night.

109
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,140
I shall leave after sunset.

110
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,300
You can’t leave.

111
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:34,940
Wei Shuye probably already knew

112
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:35,900
you are here.

113
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,540
Even if he is not certain,

114
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,300
he is suspicious.

115
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,900
If you escape now,

116
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,900
you will definitely get caught.

117
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,660
Is he really capable

118
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,460
of catching me?

119
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,620
How can you be so confident?

120
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,340
Do you know

121
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,620
how many people are there

122
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,780
wanting to catch you

123
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,860
in exchange for money?

124
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:00,980
Your portraits

125
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,500
are distributed everywhere.

126
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,500
Not only local officials,

127
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,300
but also the imperial guards

128
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,340
and some killers who specialise in

129
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,740
catching wanted people

130
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,820
are looking for you.

131
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,540
Besides,

132
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,180
it is too far away from Yanbei.

133
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:17,980
How can you fight against

134
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,300
so many people alone?

135
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,380
Are you insane?

136
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,540
I know what I am doing.

137
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,660
Ever since I decided to go back

138
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,860
to Yanbei with Yan Xun,

139
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,620
I have known 

140
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,420
I am up against

141
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,420
the entire world.

142
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,780
However, it doesn’t scare me.

143
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,380
Yanbei is Yan Xun’s hometown.

144
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,260
So is mine.

145
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,580
Even if I will die,

146
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,260
I need to go to Yanbei.

147
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,380
Fine.

148
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,660
You may go.

149
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,100
I don’t care if you get caught,

150
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,900
get hurt

151
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,580
even get killed.

152
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,820
Just don’t let me know.

153
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,340
You may get killed somewhere

154
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,980
I can’t help you.

155
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,300
I can’t stand it.

156
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,140
You always wear black or white.

157
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,580
Are you going to a funeral?

158
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,060
This one is better.

159
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,660
At least it makes you feminine.

160
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,540
Dress up and

161
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,580
come to the banquet with me.

162
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,780
After the banquet, I shall escort you leave.

163
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,380
You look more feminine

164
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,140
after dressing up.

165
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,060
Just shut

166
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,220
your mouth.

167
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,220
Let’s go.

168
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,820
You look nice.

169
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,380
Wait

170
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,420
This one is good

171
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:24,900
No one will recognize you

172
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,900
after wearing it

173
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:35,940
Pretty good

174
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,020
Were you playing me?

175
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,540
I cannot even see the road

176
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,580
after wearing it

177
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,300
Follow me if you can't see

178
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,620
Sense the direction by the sound

179
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,020
A good chance to review it

180
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,660
I won't do the make-up

181
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,100
if I know I'm wearing it

182
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:19,900
Hold my hand

183
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,180
Give me your hand, hurry

184
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:33,820
Master

185
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,820
Slow down

186
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,540
Brother Yue

187
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,900
I heard you just got a

188
00:11:51,975 --> 00:11:52,740
beauty

189
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,140
You stayed in the room with her

190
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,460
for a whole day. Never came out

191
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:57,940
I thought they were lying

192
00:11:58,025 --> 00:11:58,940
at first

193
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,020
Now I know they are telling the truth

194
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,580
Come on, brother Yue

195
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,380
You must have worked hard

196
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,260
Need to take in more nutrition

197
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,060
How's your mission going?

198
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,820
Lots of wealthy businessmen in Xianyang

199
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,460
are now transferring their fortune property

200
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,260
The majesty has been aware of this

201
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,340
I came here at night to

202
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,200
check all the things out

203
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,380
Brother Yue, anyway

204
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,380
I cannot compare with you

205
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,580
Be luck to get leisure

206
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:45,860
I was wonder why yesterday

207
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,820
you refused to

208
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:47,820
meet with me

209
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,260
Turns out you have somewhere joyful to go for

210
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,500
When Minister Tian told me yesterday

211
00:12:52,575 --> 00:12:53,380
about this

212
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,660
I could not believe it

213
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,020
Since you know

214
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,060
I am busy with her

215
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,420
You shouldn't pull me out from the bed

216
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,260
We have known for so many years

217
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,620
I thought

218
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,625
except for

219
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,900
the little maid besides you

220
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:05,940
You won't fall for

221
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,100
anyone else

222
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,980
Seems like that may not be true

223
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,940
I really want to know

224
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,900
how beautiful she is

225
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,340
You can be obsessed

226
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,900
with her like that

227
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,020
Seems like master Yue

228
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,460
found his true love

229
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,860
Master Wei

230
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,940
Let's not offend him

231
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,860
right now

232
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,900
Come on

233
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,500
Let us have a taste of

234
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,140
the good wine of Wupeng

235
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,540
Come on

236
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,020
Okay

237
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,020
Report

238
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,620
Minister, the product is arrived

239
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,260
Take him here

240
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,340
Yes

241
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:57,940
Let me go

242
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,380
Let me out

243
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,700
Let me go

244
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,580
Let me out

245
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:06,780
Behave

246
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,340
The criminal is here

247
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,220
Let me go

248
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,380
- Open it - Let me out

249
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,540
Let me out

250
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:16,980
Who are you?

251
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:17,900
Who give you the right to arrest me?

252
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:18,860
Shut up

253
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,020
He is the trusted follower of the leader of

254
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,220
the Xianyang Business Chamber

255
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,380
He owns many secrets of

256
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,780
the Xianyang Chamber

257
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,540
而且贤阳商会里

258
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,060
那本最重要的账册

259
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,260
就在他身上

260
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,460
这些日子

261
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,300
I'd ran thoroughly in all those places just to

262
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,540
find him out

263
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,180
Master Wei

264
00:14:55,575 --> 00:14:56,980
We really find a treasure

265
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,500
this time

266
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,180
Someone here

267
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,260
Take him into custody for committing felony

268
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,740
Watch him carefully
