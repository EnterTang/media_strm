全部带走 弟兄们

一个子儿都别剩

3
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,670
晚上好 朋友
Good evening, my dear fellow.

4
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:10,230
我和弟兄们要去皇宫 能拜托你引个路吗
Would you be kind enough to escort my men and I to the palace?

5
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,250
这是什么意思
What is the meaning of this?

6
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,410
我的王 
This, my good king,

7
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,620
这是将被载入英联邦史册的辉煌壮举
is going to be remembered in your delightful commonwealth.

8
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,950
因为今晚 你们将接待七大洋中
For tonight, you will be host to the most brutal of scoundrels

9
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,910
最残暴的恶棍
the seven seas has ever encountered.

10
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:29,640
拿下
Guard him.

11
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,420
慢慢来 先生们
Take your time, gents.

12
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,750
好东西多的是 人人有份
Plenty of swag for everyone.

13
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,570
小模样挺俊
That's a smart look, chum.

14
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,710
不介意的话 把佩剑交出来
Your order, if you don't mind.

15
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,090
女士 这是什么迷人香味
Ah, me lady. What is that delightful fragrance?

16
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,330
这叫沐浴
It's called a bath.

17
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,850
有机会你也该试试
You should try it sometime.

18
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,570
唐突了
Pardon me for being so bold.

19
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:25,140
现在 能麻烦你把国库的钥匙给我吗
Now, then, can I trouble you for the keys to the Treasury?

20
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,230
国库里 各种各样的金银珠宝和货币
Inside that vault was almost $3 million

21
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,030
总价值约达300万美元
in gold, silver and currency,

22
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,730
我们全部拿走了
and we took it all.

23
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,470
那天晚上
That night,

24
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,650
皇宫 国库
the Royal Palace, the Treasury

25
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,120
还有岛上所有的名门望族
and all the large island companies

26
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,480
都被我们按计划掠夺一空
were systematically plundered.

27
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,260
海盗是正在消亡的一类人
We were a dying breed,

28
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:05,500
我们是七大洋上的最后一支了
the last remaining corsairs on the seven seas.

29
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:11,120
但是瓦胡岛之行 将成为海盗一族最伟大的胜利
But the island of Oahu would be our greatest pillage.

30
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,630
女士们 先生们 晚上好
Aloha ahiahi. Ladies and gentlemen,

31
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,880
我美丽的妹妹科诺

33
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,130
但是首先 让我们以热烈的掌声欢迎新郎新娘出场
But first I'd like you all to give it up for the bride and groom.

34
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,530
他们就是
Here they are for the very first time.

35
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,430
西村先生和西村女士
Mr. And Mrs. Noshimuri.

36
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,750
借过一下 女士 发生了什么
Excuse me, Ma'am. So what happened?

37
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,400
加布里埃尔在停车场拿枪指着我
Gabriel pulled a gun on me in the parking lot.

38
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,260
我改主意了
I've changed my mind.

39
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,930
我不打算走了
No longer planning on leaving.

40
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,710
你跟你朋友
It's only a matter of time

41
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,680
迟早会再挡我的道
before you and your friends get in my way again.

42
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,570
所以我来跟你做个交易
So I've come to offer you a deal.

43
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,350
是吗
Really?

44
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,188
50%的毒品帝国
50% of his growing drug

45
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:23,760
看来出价很大方
empire seems like a pretty generous offer.

46
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,610
那你怎么说
So what'd you say?

47
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,190
我劝他最好还是开枪
I told him he'd better pull the trigger,

48
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,040
不然我早晚会找到他然后扳倒他
because if he didn't, I would find him and put him down.

49
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,810
等等
Okay, wait a minute.

50
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,850
这家伙来你妹妹的婚礼上找你
This guy comes at you at your cousin's wedding,

51
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,050
他知道我们都在这儿
he knows we're all here.

52
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,380
他不是想收买我们
This is not about a bribe.

53
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,290
他是在给我们传递一个信息
He's trying to send us a message.

54
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,600
对 他想说他一点儿也不忌惮我们
Yeah, and the message is saying he ain't scared of us.

55
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,360
伙伴们 我不是低估这件事情的严重性
Guys, look, I don't mean to downplay how serious this was,

56
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,690
只是 想想我们现在在哪儿
but... let's remember why we're here

57
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,240
你说的很对
You know what? You're absolutely right.

58
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,010
没错 这是科诺和亚当的婚礼
Yes, she is. This is Kono and Adam's night--

59
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,350
我们应该和他们一起庆祝
we should be celebrating with them.

60
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,010
这样的话 我要去找我的女王陛下
Well, in that case, I better go find Her Majesty

61
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,120

我现在膝盖有点软
I'm a little weak in the knees right now.

78

除此之外呢 杜克
What else do we know about this guy, Duke?

94
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,380
没有犯罪记录 邻居说他很友善

95
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,380
有个女朋友 伊莎贝尔・拉农

我们正在找她

他还写书

00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,400
机场小说
Airport fiction.

99
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,100
哇哦 看这个

00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,590
- 这是什么  - 录像带

101
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,110
你上次看到这种东西是什么时候了
When was the last time you saw one of these?

102
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,240
我忘了 而且都是自制的
I don't know. It's all homemade stuff.

103
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,000
有一盘不见了
Except there's one missing.

109
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,550
就在他对被害人开枪之后
Right after he puts a bullet in this guy.

- But who's Byron Washburn? - I don't know.

111
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,440
可能受害人正在写一部关于他的机场小说
Maybe this guy is writing a airport novel about him.

112
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,450
如果是这样的话 看来有第三者
If that's the case, it looks like there's somebody out there

113
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,830
不希望这个故事公之于众

00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:03,730
没有嫌疑人的痕迹 不过我们在努力找
It was clean, but we did manage to get a lead on the name

144
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,350
遗失的VHS制式录像带上的名字
from the missing VHS tape.

145
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,870
拜伦・沃什伯恩 对吧
Byron Washburn, right?

146
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,590
Beta
Beta.

147
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:12,460
- 什么  - 那是Beta制式录像带的盒子 不是VHS制式的
- Excuse me? - What is a box for a betamax tape, not VHS.

148
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,630
实际上 VHS制式录像带的尺寸要比Beta制式的大8%
VHS is actually eight percent larger than betas.

149
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,490
顺便提一句 VHR各方面都不如Beta
Incidentally, they were inferior in every way.

150
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:19,300
Beta制式的录像带画质也更好 音质也更好
Beta had better picture, better sound.

151
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,530
不过因为一些原因
But for some reason,

152
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,420
这种格式一直没在普罗大众中流行起来
the format never caught on with the general public.

153
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,604
那也是一个阴谋吗
Is that a conspiracy, too?

154
00:12:23,605 --> 00:12:25,820
不 只是一场基本格式大战
No. Just a basic format war.

155
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,250
不是所有事情都是阴谋
Not everything's a conspiracy.

156
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,900
我看好你 他怎么在这儿
I like you. Why is he here?

157
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,140
因为科诺在休蜜月假
Oh, with Kono off on her honeymoon,

158
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,400
所以我让杰瑞来帮忙
I asked Jerry to pitch in.

159
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,160
他能提供我们需要的一切帮助
Think we're gonna need all the help we can get on this one.

160
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,930
- 很高兴你能加入 杰瑞  - 不客气
- Glad to have you, Jer. - You're welcome.

161
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,510
很好 所以我们能继续谈沃什伯恩了吗
Okay, so, can we, uh... Can we get back to Washburn?

162
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,170
他的名字曾在1975年
So, the guy's name appears

163
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:44,230
出现在一家出版社的新闻稿上
on a publisher's press release from back in 1975.

164
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,500
报道显示当地一个名叫南森・埃克斯利博士的历史老师
Seems a local history teacher named Dr. Nathan Exley

165
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:52,210
当时正在写一本有关海盗的书
was writing a book about a band of pirates operating

166
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,670
这群海盗曾在19世纪80年代早期在太平洋上出没
in the Pacific during the early 1880s,

167
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,780
沃什伯恩是这群海盗中最后的幸存者
and Washburn was the last surviving member of the crew.

168
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,960
19世纪80年代还有海盗
Still had pirates in the 1880s?

169
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,110
其实我记得我听说过这帮人
Actually, you know, I remember hearing about these guys.

170
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,380
我小时候
When I was a kid,

171
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,080
我叔叔曾经给我讲过一个睡前故事
my uncle used to tell me a bedtime story

172
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,700
说的是这群海盗半夜袭击瓦胡岛
about this crew launching a midnight raid on O'Ahu.

173
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,770
传说他们曾包围全岛数小时
Legend has it that they laid siege to the island for hours

174
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,390
最后带着价值几百万的宝物逃跑了
before escaping with a treasure worth millions.

175
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,920
最后一票了 兄弟们
It's a fine haul, gents.

176
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,410
绝对是最后一票了
Fine haul indeed.

177
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,290
当然了只是传说
Of course that's just folklore.

178
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,730
几乎没人相信他们真的到过这里
Hardly anyone believes that they actually were here.

179
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,170
不过当时
But back in the day,

180
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,200
这群海盗确实袭击过几十个岛
These pirates actually did hit dozens of islands,

181
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,860
而且靠这样搜刮了一大笔财富
and they amassed a huge treasure.

182
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,570
报道上还说
The press release also says

183
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,930
南森・埃克斯利录了关于沃什伯恩的一系列录像
that Nathan Exley conducted a series of video interviews

184
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:37,380
沃什伯恩当时已经104岁了
with Washburn, who at the time was 104 years old.

185
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,330
传说中提到的大多数珍宝至今还没被找到
Most of this treasure wasn't recovered,

186
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,150
所以我们有理由假设 其中很多仍然流落在外
so it's safe to assume a lot of it's still out there.

187
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,900
也许 沃什伯恩在这盘录像带中
Maybe Washburn, on this tape,

188
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,830
提到了如何找到剩余的财宝
said something that could lead to the rest of it.

189
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:45,703
这样的话 
Okay, well, that would

1
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,490
有点凉了 不过还是很好吃哒
A bit luke, still tasty.

2
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,420
不用 谢谢了 杰瑞
No, I don't. Thank you. Um, Jerry,

3
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,690
我不想没礼貌
I don't mean to be rude,

4
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:05,970
可是你一定要在我办公室里
but do you have to work in my office,

5
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,410
用我的东西 来做事吗
at my desk... with my stuff?

6
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,720
如果你肯给我一间办公室的话 我就不会在这儿了
Not if you gave me an office.

7
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,170
好吧 我考虑一下
Okay. I'll consider it.

8
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,640
怎么样 好吧
- How about that? - Okay.

9
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,010
但是不要考虑太久 我还有得选的
But don't take too long. I do have options.

10
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,420
好的
Noted.

11
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,250
你有什么线索吗
Do you have something for me in all this?

12
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,310
你知道有句俗语叫
Hey, you know the old saying

13
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,470
椰子不会落到离树很远的地方
that the coconut doesn't fall far from the tree?

14
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,420
我很确定那是苹果 但请你继续
I'm pretty sure it's "Apple," But go on.

15
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,300
管它怎么说吧
Okay, whatever.

16
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,330
但是你们要找的这个女人 辛迪・帕特森
But that woman you're looking for, Cindy Patterson,

17
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:30,720
原来她不只是一名现代海盗
it turns out that not only is she a modern-day pirate,

18
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,310
她还是一名海盗的孙女
she's the descendant of one.

19
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,530
这话什么意思
What are you talking about?

20
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,870
她母亲的姓氏是沃什本
Her mother's maiden name was Washburn.

21
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,220
- 就是  - 就是
-As in... - As in

22
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,530
拜伦・沃什本的沃什本
Byron Washburn.

23
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:40,310
她在辛迪出生之前
She had it legally changed to Patterson

24
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:42,070
- 已经改名了  - 成
- before Cindy was born. - Chin.

25
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,250
她可能不想要
Probably to distance herself

26
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,620
这笔不义的遗产
from the legacy of a murderous pirate.

27
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,050
- 这线索不错  - 怎么了
- This is good. - What's up?

28
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,284
听这个
All right, check it out.

29
00:30:47,285 --> 00:30:49,830
辛迪帕特森是沃什本的曾外孙女
Cindy Patterson is Washburn's great-granddaughter.

30
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,590
龙生龙 凤生凤
Apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

31
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,990
就跟我说的一样
Exactly what I said.

32
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:59,140
卡尔森在拍卖会买下了艾斯利的研究资料
Okay, so Carson buys Exley's research at auction,

33
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,620
发现了沃什本的采访
discovers the Washburn interview,

34
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,870
并且联系了他家人想要他们过来看一下
and contacts the man's family to offer them a look,

35
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,360
一般好人都会这么做
which is what a nice guy would do.

36
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:06,400
他是在知道这宝藏之前
He makes this call before he learns

37
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,660
就已经打了电话
about the buried treasure,

38
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:09,840
这样他已经将他自己置身于危险之中
at which point he's already put himself in danger.

39
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,920
是不是很刺激
Doesn't this blow your mind?

40
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:16,060
你们的嫌疑人竟然是一名21世纪的安妮・伯妮
Your suspect is a 21st century Anne Bonny.

41
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,310
这是有多酷炫啊
How cool is that?

42
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,630
但是这个安妮杀人了
Except for the part where she kills a guy.

43
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:21,830
是的 没错
Yeah, except that part.

44
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:25,300
我调查了辛迪・帕特森的曾外祖父的背景
And I did some background on Cindy Patterson's great-granddad.

45
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:28,290
在40年代的时候他在宫廷里干了几年活 
It turns out that he was on staff here at the palace

46
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:30,820
不过被解雇了
for a few years in the '40s, but he got canned.

47
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,490
- 为什么  - 不清楚
- What for? - Not sure.

48
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,500
我再去调查下以前的员工记录
I'm gonna do some digging in some old employee records,

49
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,470
看有没有发现 不过
see what I can find out. But...

50
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,800
我觉得他家人已经发现了他过去是一名海盗
I'm thinking folks discovered that he had been a pirate.

51
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,520
大伙儿 有发现 过来看看
Hey, guys, I got something. Come on.

52
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:42,770
干得不错 杰瑞
Good work, Jerry.

53
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:45,230
我刚刚跟交通安全管理局的人联系
So, I just got off with TSA.

54
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:47,100
他们说辛迪帕特森两天前在佛罗里达
They told me that cindy patterson flew here

55
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,240
买了一张到夏威夷的单程票
two days ago on a one-way ticket from Florida.

56
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,190
而且她还和这人一起飞过来
She was traveling with this guy.

57
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,790
是不是有点眼熟
Notice any resemblance?

58
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:53,690
都是同一个人
Same guy.

59
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,200
他叫赛门・摩尔
Simon Moore's his name.

60
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,900
- 我们对这人有什么了解  - 并不多
- What do we know about him? - Not much.

61
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,690
但是我查了他的信用卡资料
But I checked with his credit card companies.

62
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,300
他一到这里就租了40英尺长的帆船
As soon as he got into town, he rented a 40-foot sailboat.

63
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,510
他们肯定是用那艘船计划将
That boat's got to be how they're planning

64
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,950
宝藏带出夏威夷
to get the treasure off the island.

65
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:11,830
想从你们俩身上得到答案就像拔掉牙齿那样
Getting answers out of you two is like pulling teeth.

66
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,480
不好意思
I'm sorry.

67
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,840
那招还蛮损的
That was in poor taste.

68
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,450
但是可以结束
This can end.

69
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,200
你只需要给我密码就可以了
All you got to do is give me the passcodes.

70
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,190
不
No.

71
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,740
不 不要
No, don't do it!

72
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,500
你新娘简直是一名女汉子
Your bride, she's one tough lady.

73
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:46,590
有什么要说吗
Something to say?

74
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,880
行了 好吧 你赢了
Okay! Okay, you win.

75
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,590
我会给你想要的
I'll give you what you want.

76
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,140
只是不要再碰她
Just don't touch her again.

77
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,940
不 不要
No, don't do it!

78
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,040
到你了
Your turn.

79
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,780
- 不要给他 亚当  - 把密码告诉戴门
- No, Adam, no. - Give Damon the codes.

80
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,230
亚当 不要给
Adam, no.

81
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,390
密码是没用的
The codes are useless.

82
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:10,640
我向银行做了明确的指示
I made specific instructions with my bank.

83
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,660
转账只能由我亲自操作
The transfer can only be initiated in person.

84
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,940
亚当 如果你骗我的话
Adam, if you're lying to me...

85
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,340
她必死无疑
She's gonna die.

86
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,090
慢慢地死去
Very slowly.

87
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,620
而且我还会让你看着
And I'm gonna make you watch.

88
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:32,910
- 明白吗  - 知道了
- You understand? - Yeah.

89
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,050
我知道了
I understand.

90
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,300
- 没人  - 没人
- Clear. - Clear.

91
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:54,870
没人
Clear.

92
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,500
他们可能还没找到宝藏
Maybe they haven't recovered the treasure yet.

93
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,650
又或者他们已经找到了 并且用别的途径转移了
Or they have and they're moving it some other way.

94
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,190
成 那是什么
Chin, what's that?

95
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,790
这么宝贵还藏在这里也是醉了
So much for it being priceless.

96
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,990
他们把画框给拿掉了
They ripped the frame off this thing.

97
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:18,100
里面一定有什么
There must have been something inside.

98
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,670
可能线索在油画里面
Could've been some clue on the canvas

99
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,390
又或许是其中一个镶边
or maybe one of the borders.

100
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:23,510
好吧 这画告诉了线索给他们
All right, this painting told them something.

101
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,500
我们得知道那是什么
We need to figure out what that is.

102
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:40,430
不好意思 久等了 西村先生
Sorry for the wait, Mr. Noshimuri,

103
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,970
转账现在完成了
but the transfer's now complete.

104
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:04,820
科诺
Kono.

105
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,880
大家都趴下
Everybody get down!

106
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:42,590
没事了 没事了
It's okay, it's okay.

107
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:44,520
叫救护车
Call an ambulance!

108
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,330
拜托了 他受伤了
Please, he needs help.

109
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,230
叫救护车
Somebody call an ambulance!

110
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,920
我们究竟要找什么
So what exactly are we supposed to be looking for?

111
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,050
我不知道 杰瑞
I don't know. Jerry?

112
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,540
这全部就是你们在船上找到的
This is everything from the boat?

113
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:12,350
是的 怎么了
Yeah, why?

114
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,370
天呐
Geez.

115
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,860
我怎能错过这呢 这个画框是不对的
How'd I miss this? This frame's wrong.

116
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,260
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

117
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,210
看一下 
Take a look. See?

118
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:24,980
画框不同
Different frames.

119
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:27,100
这画当初被偷走的时候
When the painting was originally stolen,

120
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,010
画框是铜制的 这个是木制
the frame was brass. This is wood.

121
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,160
所以海盗将它换了
Okay, so the pirates changed it.

122
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,140
那他们为什么要费这个劲呢
But why would they go through the trouble?

123
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:37,370
我认为找到宝藏的关键并不是画
I think the key to finding this treasure isn't the painting.

124
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:38,480
而是画框
It's the frame.

125
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:47,320
成 我需要画的图片
Chin, I need a picture of the painting.

126
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:49,090
尺寸大小一样的
Same size as the real thing.

127
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,460
小杰 你在干什么
What are you doing, Jer?

128
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,110
看 画框的每一条的后面
Take a look-- there's a notch

129
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,500
都有一个刻痕
on the back of each piece.

130
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,480
他说得没错 
He's right.

131
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:58,560
仔细看了
Now pay attention.

132
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:01,810
每个角落都代表一个方向
Each corner represents a direction.

133
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:04,730
北 东 南 西
North, east, south, west.

134
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,270
谁要说出来
So who's gonna say it?

135
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,500
你来说
You should say it.

136
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,980
刻舟求到剑了
"X" Marks the spot.

137
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,750
我们准备搞定了
We're almost done.

138
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:35,910
赛门
Simon.

139
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,940
赛门 我找到了
Simon, I found it.

140
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:40,760
赛门
Simon.

141
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,600
赛门
Simon?

142
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,830
掩护
Cover!

143
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:15,390
就是它了
That's it, isn't it?

144
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:30,900
最好是纯金的
Those better be solid gold.

145
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:36,820
并不是
They're not.

146
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,530
我以为你说这堆值几百万呢
I thought you said this stuff was worth millions.

147
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,600
兄弟 我可以去城里的典当铺
Man, I can go down to aloha pawn,

148
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,730
把这些连这个箱子都买到
buy everything in here and the case

149
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,970
而且给20美元还有得找呢
and still get change back from a 20.

150
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,260
这就是传说故事嘛
That's the legend.

151
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,560
有可能海盗船长将宝藏给埋了当作诱饵
You know, maybe the captain buried this as a decoy.

152
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,930
真正的宝藏还在外面
The real treasure could still be out there.

153
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:52,120
好吧 如果真是这样的话
Yeah, well, if it is,

154
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,600
不少人白白牺牲了他们的生命了
a lot of people Lost their lives for nothing.

155
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,270
让我猜一下
Let me guess--

156
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,700
你们就只是找到些银器和几个蜡烛台
You found some silverware and a couple candlesticks.

157
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,890
是啊 你怎么知道的
Yeah, how'd you know that?

158
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:11,080
我查了一下宫廷档案
Went through the palace archive,

159
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,840
找到了沃什本的旧员工记录
found Washburn's old employee record.

160
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,220
他被解雇了
The dude was fired from the gig

161
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,350
是因为他被怀疑偷了银器
because he was suspected of stealing some silverware

162
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:17,480
和几个蜡烛台
and a couple candlesticks.

163
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:18,340
你震惊到人家了
I'm shocked.

164
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,470
好吧 其实并没有 杰瑞 他是名海盗
I'm not really shocked, Jerry, the guy was a pirate.

165
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:23,660
不 其实他不是 这是最扯淡的部分
No, He wasn't. That's the crazy part.

166
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:26,080
根据这文档 沃什本出生于1882年
According to this, Washburn was born in 1882.

167
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,510
也就说他对艾斯利谎报了年龄
which means he lied about his age to Exley.

168
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,900
那些海盗在暴戾恣睢的时候
When those pirates were doing their thing,

169
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,210
他还是小屁孩一枚
Washburn was still in diapers.

170
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:32,910
所以沃什本撒谎说他是海盗
So Washburn lied about being a pirate.

171
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:34,180
整件事就是一个大骗局
Whole thing was a giant hoax.

172
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,900
他确实是在宫廷干活
Well, hell, the guy did work at the palace.

173
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,214
我肯定他一定有
I'm sure he had some insider

174
00:42:37,215 --> 00:42:39,140
宫廷历史那方面的内幕故事
knowledge as to the history of the place.

175
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,650
有可能他想可以加上海盗传说
Probably figured he could use that plus the pirate legend,

176
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:42,830
来给自己赚点钱
make himself some cash.

177
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:43,990
大家都喜欢海盗故事什么的
Everyone fell for it.

178
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:47,350
艾斯利 基努 我们
Exley, Keanu, us.

179
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:50,550
还有他的曾外孙女
His own great- granddaughter.

180
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:57,860
你在你的蜜月期打电话给我干什么呢
What are you doing, calling me on your honeymoon?

181
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,670
你还好吧
You okay?

182
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:29,450
他们有说什么吗
What are they saying?

183
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:32,670
还没有 他还在手术室里
Nothing, yet. He's still in surgery.

184
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,890
但是即使他撑过来了
But even if he pulls through,

185
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:36,990
加布里埃尔带着他的钱逃了
Gabriel got away with the money

186
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,920
那笔钱是用来从山口组那边赎回亚当的自由
that was meant to buy his freedom from the Yakuza.

187
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:44,080
没有那笔钱 我和他就没命了
Without it, we're both dead.
