1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,890
-亲爱的  好好享受比赛哦  -谢谢
- Oh, hey, honey. Have a great time at the game. - Thanks.

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,470
什么在响
Oh. Why are you crunching?

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,520
通常  我是守规矩的人
Ordinarily, I'm a rule follower,

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,840
但是如果有人不准我
but when someone tells me I can't bring

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,610
自带零食进体育馆
my own snacks into their stadium,

6
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,500
我就要生气[坚果]了
that's when I get a little nuts.

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,160
这是个自由的国家不是吗
It's a free country, right?

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,030
这么说吧  让我不爽[薯片]的是
Let's just say it ruffles me...

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,900
某些蠢货[花生]叫我
when some goobers tell me...

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,110
在发薪日[糖]花上半天
I have to spend half my payday...

11
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,310
在他们的热狗上
on their hot dogs.

12
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,780
记得回来照全家福
Please, just remember the family portrait.

13
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,100
-摄影师只有一个小时时间  -好吧
- We only have the photographer for an hour. Okay? - Okay.

14
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,030
亲爱的  要不要去试试
And, sweetie, did you have a chance to

15
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,570
我放在你衣橱里面的白裤子
try on the white pants I put in your closet?

16
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,290
哦  长什么样的
Oh, what do they look like?

17
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,040
白裤子还能长什么样
Is there really a more clear way to describe white pants?

18
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,750
亲爱的  如果不合适
Sweetie, if they don't fit you,

19
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,680
你就是全家唯一没穿白裤子的人了
you're going to be the only one not wearing white,

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,120
然后你就像"沃尔多在哪里"一样明显扎眼
[美国儿童杂志上的一款游戏
读者要在一群人当中找出沃尔多]

22
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,150
实际上  沃尔多在哪里不会明显扎眼
Actually, "Where's Waldo?" doesn't stand out.

23
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:55,920
你很难找到他  那正是游戏乐趣所在
He's super hard to find. That's the challenge.

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,350
此次全家福对我来说很重要
This portrait is incredibly important to me.

25
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,900
而且  他就叫沃尔多  没有"在哪里"
Also, his name is just "Waldo."

26
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,790
我花了好几周时间才选到
I spent weeks trying to find

27
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:01,960
一个每个人都有空的时间
a time that works for everybody...

28
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,310
还有合适的摄影师
and finding the right photographer.

29
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:07,170
你向我保证会乖乖合作  好吗
So if you could just promise me that you'll cooperate, okay?

30
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,430
-我保证  -好吧
- I promise. -Okay.

31
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,390
-你想得真周到  -谢谢
- This is amazing that you're doing this. - Mmm, thank you.

32
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,240
-你太棒了  -谢谢
- You're wonderful. - Thank you.

33
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,280
过来
Get in here

34
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,090
-哎呀使不得  -哦
- Oh, no can do. - Oh.

35
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,670
-我爱你  -拜拜
- I love you. - Bye.

36
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,670
我的好内裤哪去了
Where's my good underwear?

37
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,810
问题应该是
The question is,

38
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,340
为什么你还有烂内裤  杰
why isn't all your underwear good, Jay?

39
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,410
你赚钱那么多
You make a nice living.

40
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,210
新来的佣人老是把我的内裤和曼尼的弄混
The new maid keeps mixing up my underwear with Manny's.

41
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,340
有一次我随便抓了一条
Put on the first thing I grabbed.

42
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,010
紧得跟止血带一样
It was like a crotch tourniquet.

43
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,830
-你得跟她说啊  -为什么让我说
- You gotta talk to her. - Why me?

44
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,500
喂  你们说一样的语言
Hola. You both speak the same language.

45
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,570
她是葡萄牙人  你知不知道
She's Portuguese. Do you know how offensive it is...

46
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,120
把我们混为一类人是很不礼貌的
that you put all of us in the same mixing pot?

47
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,400
抱歉  请代我给她道个歉  还告诉她
Sorry. Please apologize to her when you tell her not to

48
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,630
-不要把我的内裤  -我们语言不通
- put my underwear- - I can't talk to her!

49
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,100
-卢克呢  -我代替他去
- Where's Luke? - I'm going instead.

50
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,520
卢克有个家庭作业明天就要交了
Luke suddenly remembered a school project due tomorrow.

51
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,390
噢  太不幸了
Oh, that's tough.

52
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,740
但是这对他可能是不错的一课
But it's a good lesson for the kid.

53
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,100
你作了承诺
You know, you make a commitment,

54
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,650
-你得要兑现  -对
- you gotta follow through. - Yeah.

55
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:02,900
是什么作业
What is the project?

56
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,710
他要采访一个曾经生活在60年代的人
He has to interview somebody who lived through the 1960s.

57
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,050
不会吧
Oh, no.

58
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,210
喂
Hello.

59
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,190
是啊  卢克
Yeah, Luke.

60
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,790
当然  我记得我承诺过什么
Oh, sure. I remember what I said.

61
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,160
过来吧  好
Yeah, come on over. All right.

62
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,720
歌洛莉亚  你得带曼尼去看比赛
Gloria, you're gonna have to take Manny to the game.

63
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,170
好耶  曼尼  快点
Yay. Manny, vamos!

64
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,710
我还在穿衣服呢
I'm still getting dressed.

65
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,470
妈  我觉得我减肥有效果了
Hey, Mom, I think my diet's working.

66
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,330
我内裤都松了
My underwear won't stay up.

67
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,420
摩登家庭 第一季第二十四集

70
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,710
好吃  来
Oh, so delicious. Yes.

71
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,340
今天不和你去没关系吧
Hey, you're okay with me not going with you today, right?

72
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,100
有人请我周末去婚礼献唱
I have been hired to sing at a wedding this weekend.

73
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,990
我在一次精彩的卡拉OK
I was plucked from obscurity

74
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:01,070
演出后被别人选中了
after a particularly stirring karaoke performance.

75
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,860
所以说呢  我也算是专业歌手了
So I guess you could say I'm a professional singer now.

76
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,200
他们是以花代钱付给你的  所以呢
Well, they're paying you in flowers, so-

77
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,930
反正就算他们给钱  我也会拿去买花的
Well, I would've blown the money on flowers anyway.

78
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:09,970
他们倒是省了我的麻烦
They're saving me a step.

79
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,900
再说所有的歌后都有人献花
Plus all the great divas are rewarded in flowers.

80
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,090
然后还有支票
They're also given paychecks.

81
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,390
我不大擅长闲聊  所以呢
And I'm really bad at small talk, so-

82
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,030
我懂了  没什么问题
I get it. It's not a problem.

83
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,220
是吗  我看你一早上没说话
Are you sure? 'Cause you've been quiet all morning.

84
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,170
因为我得酝酿一下我的嗓子
It's because I'm resting my instrument.

85
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,640
好吧
Okay.

86
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,010
我看他是压力巨大
I feel tension.

87
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,050
科比  科比  这边
Kobe! Kobe, over here!

88
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,530
科比  科比  这边
Kobe! Kobe! Over here!

89
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,850
需要帮忙吗
What can I do for you?

90
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,230
你喜欢当篮球运动员吗
Do you like being a basketball player?

91
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,800
不是吧你
Serious?

92
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,210
我紧张了  我没想到你会往这边看
I choked. I didn't think you'd look up here at me.

93
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,600
那下次准备下
Little preparation next time.

94
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,980
用用脑子好好想哦
It's a mental game.

95
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,410
懂了
Duly noted.

96
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,320
-好  -湖人队入场
- All right. - Your Los Angeles Lakers!

97
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,430
-怎么了  -楼梯坏了
- What's wrong? - That broken step.

98
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,290
全家福会因此被毁的
It's gonna ruin our whole family portrait.

99
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,720
我是这样想的  我兴奋得不得了
Okay, here's my idea. I'm really excited about it.

100
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,210
全家人都穿白色
The whole extended family, all dressed in white,

101
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,810
一字从上到下排开
in a single-file line down the staircase.

102
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,310
就像高速公路的汽车
Oh, like a line on the highway.

103
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,350
不是
No.

104
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,570
那跳台滑雪
Or, uh, a ski jump.

105
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:21,640
也不是
No.

106
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,380
我搞跳台滑雪干嘛
Why- Why would I want a ski jump?

107
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:23,960
不知道
I don't know.

108
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,000
我是想一家人在一张大床上
My idea was to have the whole family in a giant bed,

109
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,190
就像威利・旺卡一样
[威利・旺卡  《查理与巧克力工厂》人物]

111
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,060
那简直太"可笑"了
Yeah, but that's ridiculous.

112
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,570
应该是"可口"
"Ridiculicious."

113
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,310
我什么都没看到
I don't see anything.

114
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,700
所以是我疯了吗
So I'm crazy?

115
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,780
不  你  没有
No. You're... not.

116
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,830
你爸早该把这个楼梯修好的
Your father was supposed to fix that step.

117
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,980
妈  你对这些小细节太挑剔了
Mom, you're obsessing over the tiniest little thing-

118
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,730
这么说你也看到了
So you do see it, yeah.

119
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,130
不就照张相嘛  有什么大不了的
What is the big deal about this one picture?

120
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,100
亲爱的  我跟你说
Honey, you know what,

121
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,040
我不指望你能理解  但是
I don't expect you to understand, but-

122
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,300
这样  等你以后当妈了
All right, when you're a mom,

123
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,570
会感到时光如白驹过隙
everything goes by so quickly.

124
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,090
要不了多久  卢克就开始刮胡子了
In a minute, Luke's gonna be shaving,

125
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,000
艾丽克斯去上大学  你呢
and Alex is gonna be off at college, and you're gonna be-

126
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,650
你会做一些了不起的事情
you'll be doing something great.

127
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,170
我就是想时间定格在这一刻
I just wanna freeze this moment as it is right now.

128
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,380
-能理解吧  -能
- You know? - I do.

129
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,630
我知道我平时松松垮垮
I know I don't show it,

130
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,000
但是这个家庭对我来说很重
but this family's still the most important thing-

131
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,600
管它呢
Screw it.

132
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,040
我亲自来修
I'm gonna fix the bastard.

133
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,080
我倒要看看有多难
I mean, seriously, how hard can it be?

134
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,980
你老爸能行  那我也能行  对吧
If your father can do it, I can do it. Right?

135
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,620
好吧
All right.

136
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,550
我只需要
I just need to...

137
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,320
抬起来-
lift-

138
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,390
现在我看见了
Oh, now I see it.

139
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,800
我们的位置真棒
These seats are amazing.

140
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,050
你口袋里怎么有糖漏出来
Why you have candy coming out of your pocket?

141
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:47,870
不是不是不是
No, no, no, no, no.

142
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,490
-什么  -我自己带了零食
- Huh? - I brought my own snacks.

143
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,990
不是我小气  这是原则问题
Not because I'm cheap. It's a matter of principle.

144
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,800
再说冒着被人发现的危险其实挺刺激的
Plus I get a little rush from the danger.

145
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,780
淡定  装酷
Be cool. Be cool.

146
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,550
-什么  -淡定  看前面
- What? - Be cool. Just look straight ahead.

147
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,850
我感觉好极了  哦吼
I never felt more alive. Whoo!

148
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,060
我越搞越糟糕  但我没有惊惶失措
Okay, I just made it worse. I'm not freaking out though.

149
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,680
我打电话给你爸  问他怎么修
I'm gonna call your dad, and he's gonna tell me how to fix this.

150
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,770
-天啊  是老爸  -哪儿
- Oh, my God! It's Dad. - Where?

151
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,800
那里  科比的后面
Right there, behind Kobe.

152
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,470
-天啊  -真是太少见了
- Oh, my god! - How weird is this!

153
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,910
快点快点  想一件事情来吓他
Quick. Quick, tell me something to say that will freak him out.

154
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,740
-说我怀孕了  -不  那个可不能乱说
- Tell him I'm pregnant. - No, not gonna say that.

155
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,990
响了响了  真是太有趣了
Okay, here we go. How funny is this!

156
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,510
你好  我是菲尔  有事请留言
Hey, it's Phil. You know what to do.

157
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,590
真是"有趣"呀
Well, that was pretty funny.

158
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,790
天啊
Oh, my God!

159
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,960
天啊
Oh, my God.

160
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
天啊  天啊  天啊
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

161
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,580
天啊  天啊
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

162
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,000
天啊  天啊  天啊
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

163
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,840
天啊  噢
Oh, my God. Oh.

164
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,030
好多了  失陪一下
It's much better. Excuse me. Sorry.

165
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,500
喂
Hello?

166
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,660
家里进来一只鸽子
There is a pigeon in our house.

167
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,800
怎么办  怎么办
What do I do? What do I do?

168
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,190
你谁呢
Who is this?

169
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,580
-不搞笑  一点都不搞笑  -冷静
- Never funny. Not funny now. - Calm down.

170
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,120
我从小就是在动物的陪伴下长大的
You know I grew up around many animals.

171
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,590
有一次一只公鸡袭击我
One time, a rooster attacked me,

172
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,450
我妈把它脖子拧了  然后晚上就吃鸡
and my mom wrung its neck, and we had it for dinner.

173
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,650
你真会挑时间讲故事  速回来救我
Great time for an anecdote. Help me.

174
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,390
其实它更怕你
It's more afraid of you than you are of it.

175
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,500
鸽子什么都不怕
Pigeons aren't scared of anything.

176
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,220
电线他们都敢站
They stand on electrical wires.

177
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,100
你会没事的  米奇尔  只要你不
You're gonna be fine, Mitchell. Just as long as you don't-

178
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,770
那个  他们要开始了
You know what, they're starting.

179
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,540
我得挂了  拜拜
I gotta go. Okay, bye.

180
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,070
只要我不怎么  小卡
As long as I don't what? Cam?

181
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,080
只要我不怎么  我的个娘亲
As long as I don't- Oh, God!

182
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,920
酷  接吻镜头来了
Cool. The kiss cam.

183
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,540
如果镜头圈到了我们
Wouldn't it be embarrassing if the camera

184
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,630
-会不会很尴尬  -我们是亲戚
- was on us and then the crowd started- - We're related.

185
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,700
但没有血缘关系
Not by blood.

186
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,420
你敢碰我  就让你"血溅当场"
Touch me and there will be blood.

187
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:57,690
-我们不行  -你怎么了
- Not us. - What's wrong with you?

188
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:58,430
是接吻镜头
It's the kiss cam.

189
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,900
要是圈到我们  我们就得接吻
When it lands on you, you're supposed to kiss.

190
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,170
她是我岳父的二婚妻子
This is my wife's dad's second wife.

191
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:07,960
法律上没问题  但是很怪异
So legally okay, but still weird.

192
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,960
太尴尬了
That was awkward.

193
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,600
又是我们
And we're back.

194
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,350
来吧  又没什么大不了的
Oh. Ay! Come on. It's not a big deal.

195
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,960
多亏了来电显示
Thank God for caller I.D.

196
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,830
于是你不想接你老婆电话就可以挂掉
So you don't have to talk to your wife.

197
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,430
看我回来收拾你
Oh, we're gonna talk, mister.

198
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,800
我会慢慢慢慢说死你
We're gonna talk and talk.

199
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,700
老爸  妈妈在电视上看到你了  你死定了
Dad, Mom saw you on TV. You're dead.

200
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,950
是这样的  接吻镜头应该只针对
Here's the thing. The kiss cam is only supposed to be...

201
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:49,610
现场观众娱乐一下的
for the enjoyment of the people at the game.

202
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,320
电视上根本不该播
They never show that on TV.

203
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:55,080
人们在自己的比赛场上做什么
What people do in the privacy of their own sports arena...

204
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,790
是他们的自由
should be their own business.

205
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:02,240
66年的时候我在我爷爷的办公品公司打工
So in '66, I worked in my grandfather's office supply business-

206
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,490
就是墨水啊  订书钉啊  纸张之类的
you know, your ink, your staples, your legal pads.

207
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,760
我说得太快了吗
Am I going too fast for you?

208
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,590
我听得都睡着了
I fell asleep for a second.

209
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,500
你在60年代就没做过有意思的事吗
Did you do anything interesting in the '60s?

210
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,260
有一个夏天
Well, one summer,

211
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,930
我在姥爷的理发店里帮忙扫头发
I swept up hair at my other grandfather's barbershop.

212
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,710
-别折磨我了  -你想要什么样的故事
- You're killing me. - What do you want?

213
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,790
我也不确定
I don't know.

214
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,550
布莱恩・贝壳维斯的爷爷当年在华盛顿游行过呢
Brian Beckwith's grandfather marched on Washington.

215
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,680
阿蒂・贝壳维斯吗
Artie Beckwith?

216
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,210
那个整天里吧嗦  怨天尤人的怂货
He couldn't walk two feet without complaining.

217
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,020
他去华盛顿游行过
He marched on Washington?

218
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,480
他是这样告诉布莱恩的
He told Brian he did.

219
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,490
跟马丁・路德・金一起
With Martin Luther King Jr.

220
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,910
马丁・路德・金

221
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,530
-你以为他的理发师是谁  -什么
- Guess who cut his hair. - What?

222
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,390
你知道马丁・路德・金的理发师是谁吗
Do you know who cut Martin Luther King Jr.'s hair?

223
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,120
卢克的老师怕是也不知道
Neither does Luke's teacher.

224
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,570
-所以理发店是在华盛顿啊  -是的
- So the barbershop was in Washington? - Okay.

225
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,200

[巴斯・奥尔德  人类首次登陆月球的宇航员之一]

Okay, you know what, Lily? I am a man.

233
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,560
爸这就去厨房给你拿牛奶
I am going into the kitchen to get your milk.

234

- And it's Elvis. - No way.

248
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,770

Greatest singer that ever lived, after Sinatra.

249
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,500
谁敢反驳我就跟他急
I'll fight any man who says different.

250
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,050
我老爸说最棒的歌手是彼柏・布莱森
My dad says the greatest singer who ever lived is Peabo Bryson.

251
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,610
那我只好找你老爸算算账了
Then I guess I gotta fight your dad.

252

干嘛什么都跟我过不去
Why does everything have to suck?

255
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,900
我们还是改天照相吧
Let's just do the picture another day.

256
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,340
我脸上马上要冒痘痘了

不行

Do you know how long it took me to book this photographer?

259
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,260
在壁炉那里照怎么样
Maybe by the fireplace.

260
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:11,000
行啊  旧时代的老人都喜欢在那儿画塑像
Yeah. That's a classic old-person spot for a portrait.

261
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,830
拉倒吧  墙的颜色太恶心了
Yeah, if I'd ever bothered to paint that hideous wall.

克莱尔是个完美主义者  这有时候是好事
Claire is a perfectionist, which sometimes is a good thing,

比如选个绝代老公什么的
like when it comes to picking a husband.

264
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,760
有时候就不太好了
Sometimes it's a bad thing,

265
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,670
比如大家都觉得某样东西很不错
like when everyone else sees something beautiful...

266
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,930
而她的眼里就只有那些丁点大的瑕疵

271
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,780
这个  怕是不太可能了
Yeah, that's- that's not gonna work.

272
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,200
所以
So-

273
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:53,080
再缠一圈吧  粘紧点  用点力
Maybe one more layer. And tight, really tight.

274
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,510
-爸  能再催催他们吗  -刚打过了
- Dad, can you call them again? - I just did.

00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,550
他们在路上了  比赛打进加时赛了
They're on their way. Game went into overtime.

276
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,790
我知道  但是太阳都快落山了
I know, but we're losing the light,

277
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,420
而且摄影师
and the photographer's

278
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,200
10分钟后还要去个犹太男孩成人仪式
gotta get to a bar mitzvah in 10 minutes.

279
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,040
红酒  现在  你不是吧
Oh, red wine. Really? Now?

280
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,640
亲爱的
You know, honey,

281
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,470
我觉得你有点太神经质了
I think you're getting a little too uptight about this.

282
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,630
-我呼吸困难了  -你没事的
- It's hard to breathe. - Oh, you're fine.

283
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,020
你把他怎么了  他脸都绿了
What'd you do to him? He's turning blue.

284
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,490
只要他的衣服是白色的就行
But his clothes will stay white.

285
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,250
-我们回来咯  -谢天谢地
- We're home! - Oh, thank God.

286
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,750
曼尼  我们换衣服去
Manny, let's go change.

287
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,250
嘿  又看见我美丽的贤妻了
Hey, there's my beautiful wife.

288
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,880
我知道你生我的气
I know you're mad at me,

289
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,930
我也知道这泡沫手指无法弥补我的过错
and I know this foam finger can't make up for everything.

290
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:23,890
亲爱的  你赶紧换衣服
Honey, you just go change,

291
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,230
那事儿我们回头再说
and we'll talk about what you did later.

292
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,970
嘿  谢谢你买票给我们
Hey, thank you so much for those tickets.

293
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,710
歌洛莉亚说你们玩得很开心
Gloria tells me you had a real good time.

294
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,970
没没  我可没有
Not really. No, I didn't.

295
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,120
上苍作证  我爱你女儿
God, I love your daughter.

296
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,180
我到时候再回来
I should- I should come by

297
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,960
亲下这台阶  修好这台阶
and kiss that step- fix that step.

298
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,090
你说的好像我是故意把家里弄得一团糟一样
Oh, you're acting like I wanted to destroy the house.

299
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,520
不  我只是觉得奇怪
No. I just think it's odd

300
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,160
你毁掉的大部分东西
that the majority of things you destroyed...

301
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,270
都是我妈送给我们的
were sent to us by my mom.

302
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,280
好吧  好吧
Okay, okay, okay.

303
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,060
也就是说我和那臭脏鸟周旋的时候
So while I'm fighting off that filthy creature,

304
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,040
还会有时间停下来想  哎呀真好
I actually stop and say, "Oh, you know what,

305
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,080
总算可以借机毁掉那些
here's the opportunity I've always been looking for

306
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,810
庸俗不堪的东西了
to destroy our kitschiest objects."

307
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,050
庸俗不堪  她听到一定会很"开心"的
Kitschiest? Oh, she's gonna love that.

308
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,830
其实如果你跟着我去婚礼
If you would've come with me to the wedding,

309
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,000
这一切都不会发生了
none of this would have happened.

310
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,120
你是真生气了啊
Okay. So you are angry.

311
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,260
米奇尔  我懂的
Mitchell, I get it.

312
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,490
你讨厌扯家常  还不喜欢鸟
You're terrified of small talk and birds.

313
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,480
你一定很庆幸那小鸽子
You're just lucky that pigeon

314
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,130
没缠着你聊天气状况吧
didn't want to chat you up about the weather.

315
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,770
-你好  杰  -你们也好
- Hello, Jay. - Hello, guys.

316
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,820
老天  你怎么穿得跟"舞迷"节目的选手似的
Oh, God. Oh, you look like the guy from Dance Fever.

317
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,380
多谢夸奖
Thank you.

318
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,600
丹尼・特里奥  俄亥俄州克里夫兰市
["舞迷"节目的主持人]

320
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,930
老爸  非要这样吗  我不是在夸你
Dad, really? That is not a compliment.

321
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:16,470
所以之前我才让你先穿上试试  转过去
That's why I wanted you to try those on earlier. Turn around.

322
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,750
今天不能拍照  我的痘痘越发明显了
The picture can't happen today. My pimple's getting worse.

323
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,360
我可怜的小宝贝  你还能站着吗
Oh, honey, I am so sorry. Can you stand?

324
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,610
-能  -那就得拍
- Yeah. - Well, then the picture's happening.

325
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,250
大家一定会紧盯着我不放的
It's all anybody's gonna see.

326
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,710
我看可不一定
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

327
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,390
你看见她穿的裙子了吗
Did you get a look at her dress?

328
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,900
什么  我看她裙子干嘛  我爱的是你
What? Why would I look at her dress? I love you.

329
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,120
邓菲太太  太阳就快下山了
Uh, Mrs. Dunphy, the sun is setting.

330
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,970
好的  这就拍
Okay. Yeah, this is happening.

331
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,050
大家  快来  我们出去了
Everybody, come on. Let's go.

332
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,940
小心点  我下午才给家具刷了漆摆外边呢
Be careful. I stained some furniture out there this afternoon.

333
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,160
可不是嘛  老爸
Of course you did, Dad.

334
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,460
还有什么需要注意的吗
Anything else I need to know about?

335
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,980
没准旁边邻居正忙着打彩弹呢
Maybe the neighbors on either side are having a paintball fight.

336
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,590
都看好了  我那睿智无比的老爹
Now watch this. Dad, in his infinite wisdom,

337
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,740
今天给家具刷了漆
stained furniture today.

338
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,170
千万别碰着了  还没干呢
Don't touch it. It's wet.

339
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,240
-快点快点  -别照了  亲爱的
- Hurry, hurry. - Put that down, sweetheart.

340
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,990
很好很好  大家都过来了  现在站这边
Okay. Okay, we got it. Now we're gonna go out here.

341
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,170
老天啊  你在耍我吗
Oh, my God! Are you kidding me?

342
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,950
那洒水器怎么关
How do- How do you turn the sprinklers off?

343
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,090
又问我  当然了  就因为我是拉丁人
Ay! Of course! Because I'm Latina,

344
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,910
我就该对花园  洒水器什么的了如指掌
I'm supposed to know everything about gardening and sprinklers!

345
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,660
他们装这东西的时候就你在
You were here when they installed it.

346
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:12,450
是诶  控制器在草坪那边
Ay, yeah. The box is across the yard.

347
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,240
你是说要跨过这片黄浦江吗
You mean your now-soaking-wet yard?

348
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,790
真好  彻底歇菜了
That's great. We are screwed.

349
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,060
不  还没
No, we're not.

350
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,540
我们还没出秘密武器呢
We haven't unwrapped our secret weapon yet.

351
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,650
拆弹特工--卢克小神童过去
Luke walks over there, Hurt Locker style...

352
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,490
关掉开关
flips the switch,

353
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,430
嘭  或者不嘭  水就关了
and boom- or not boom- water off.

354
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,600
好男儿志当英雄  儿子
Put the "he" in "hero," son.

355
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:42,080
拆弹专家  洒水器终结者还差不多
Hurt Locker? It's more like Squirt Locker.

356
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,400
不是吧  不搞笑吗
Really? That wasn't funny?

357
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,250
我真同情你们这群没幽默感的
I actually pity you guys.

358
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,700
没空庆祝了  都给我停
No time to celebrate! Stop it!

359
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,250
-我们时间不多了  -好的  大家
- We don't have a lot of time. - All right, everybody.

360
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,220
-请小个子的站前面  -先生
- If I can have the little ones down front- - You know what, sir?

361
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,700
不介意的话  我来吧
If you don't mind, I've got this.

362
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,080
大伙  都过来吧
Come on, people, let's get out here.

363
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,680
海莉  艾丽克斯  你们给弟弟拆胶带
Haley, Alex, I need you to unwrap your brother.

364
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,440
邓菲一家站这边
All right, I need the Dunphys over on this side.

365
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,880
爸爸  你站中间
Dad, you're in the middle.

366
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,910
米奇尔  小卡  莉莉站那边
Mitchell, Cam, Lily on this end. Okay.

367
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:14,930
-听我说  -怎么
- Listen. - Uh-huh?

368
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:18,960
亲爱的  我错了  如果你再次投入我怀抱
Honey, I screwed up, but if ever you're in my arms again-

369
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,600
-菲尔  现在不说这些  -就得现在说
- Phil, not now. - Yes, now.

370
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,650
我不想日后看到这张照片时
I don't want to look at this picture...

371
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,320
比如我80岁  而你早已与世长辞的时候
when I'm 80 years old and you're long dead...

372
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,120
还想到你拍照时心里深藏的怒气
and know that you were angry at me when we took it.

373
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,680
菲尔  回头再说行吗
Phil, we'll talk about what you did later.

374
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,710
好了  大家  请看这里
Okay, everybody. Eyes over here.

375
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,700
不关我的事  是她亲的我
I didn't do anything. She kissed me.

376
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,500
什么
What?

377
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,880
-谁亲了你  -歌洛莉亚
- Who kissed you? - Gloria.

378
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,290
-什么  -是接吻镜头[同音:亲了小卡]
- What? - It was the kiss cam.

379
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,340
你亲小卡做什么
Why did you kiss Cam?

380
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,440
不是  我亲了菲尔  他说必须那样
No, I kissed Phil. He told me I had to.

381
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,210
-不是这样的  -等一下
- No, no. - Okay, hang on a second.

382
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,600
这是在你无视
Was this before or after

383
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,310
老婆电话之前还是之后
you ignored the phone call from your wife?

384
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,110
那个你也看见了
You saw that too?

385
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:50,440
我们就不能先把相照了吗
Could we please just take the damn picture?

386
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,110
好了  大伙  再来一次
Okay. Everybody, one more time.

387
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,620
-你知道吗  我很生你的气  -我就知道
- Just so you know, I am angry with you. - I knew it!

388
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,030
-我靠  -今天对我来说很重要
- Oh, damn it! - It was a big day for me,

389
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,080
而他不参加的原因是他不喜欢扯家常
and he didn't want to go because he doesn't like small talk.

390
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,970
把你们这些小吵小闹
Would it be terribly inconvenient...

391
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,230
推迟那么几分钟就有那么难吗
to just postpone this hissy fit for a few minutes?

392
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,080
你知道吗  或许我们根本就
Ok, you know what? Maybe some of us don't

393
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,490
-不想今天拍照  -多谢
- want to take a picture today. - Thank you.

394
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,280
拜托了  克莱尔
And please, Claire,

395
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,260
别逼米奇尔做他不想做的事
don't try to make Mitchell do something he doesn't wanna do.

396
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,280
闭嘴吧  小卡
Oh, shut up, Cam.

397
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,190
好了  别闹了
Okay, stop it! Stop it!

398
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,110
大家都听好了  我真的好不容易才筹划好
Everyone, listen. This took me forever to put together,

399
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,840
所以我真的不在乎
so I don't really care

400
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,830
谁亲了谁  谁额头上长了痘痘
who kissed who and who's got a pimple on her head...

401
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,280
或者谁穿了超级不得体的裙子
and who is wearing an outrageously inappropriate dress.

402
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,150
我们要打起精神  假装一切正常
We are gonna get together and act like a normal family...

403
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,160
持续十分之一秒就行
for one-tenth of a freaking second,

404
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,120
现在就这么办
and we're gonna do it right now.

405
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,880
-快点  -别碰我
- Come on, let's go. - Get your hands off of me.

406
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,950
就不  就不  你怎样
No. No. Make me. Make me.

407
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:38,600
太荒唐了  你们两个对每件事都那么纠结
Ah, this is ridiculous. You're both uptight about everything.

408
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,870
你不想陪他去参加婚礼
You didn't want to go to a wedding with him

409
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,330
就因为不愿意和别人聊天是吗
because you didn't want to make small talk?

410
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,000
我就是这样认识歌洛莉亚的
That's how I met Gloria.

411
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,730
还记得我对你说的第一句话吗
Do you remember the first thing I said to you?

412
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,290
记得  "我喜欢巧克力
Yes. "I like chocolate,

413
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:50,140
我喜欢水果  但不喜欢两样加在一起"
I like fruit, but not together."

414
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:53,130
常青藤高材生  你忍不了是吗  还有你
You couldn't come up with that, lvy League? And you.

415
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,140
你要是不那么完美主义
You would be a lot happier if you weren't

416
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,160
就会活得开心得多
so obsessed with everything being perfect.

417
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,960
瞧瞧我们一身白  什么东西  板球队吗
Look at us here all in white. What are we, a cricket team?

418
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,400
告诉你吧  生活本就不完美  克莱尔
News flash. Life is not perfect, Claire.

419
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,490
现在都给我冷静下来
Now calm the hell down.

420
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,560
好吧老爸  很好  对你来说当然轻松
Okay, Dad, that's great, and that's really easy for you to say.

421
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,170
但你以为是我想这样吗
But do you think I like being like this?

422
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,300
并非如此
No, I don't.

423
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,890
所以如果你有什么良方
So if you have some quick-and-easy fix,

424
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,980
何不现在就说来听听
why don't you just give it to me right now?

425
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,310
-杰  -我的老天
- Jay! - Oh, my God.

426
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,470
看我的  宝贝
I- I got this, baby.

427
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,060
不  你干  你干什么
No. What did- What did you do?

428
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,090
现在两个人都弄脏了
Now two people are dirty.

429
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,280
三个
Well, three.

430
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,210
好吧  你自找的
Okay, you know what?

431
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,530
谁叫你说"庸俗不堪"
That's for "Kitschy."

432
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:38,830
泥巴大战
Mud fight!

433
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,700
别这样  别别  停下
No. Don't do that. No, no, no! Stop it!

434
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,510
大家都站好  都听话  别闹了
Everybody get back in line. Come on, guys, stop.

435
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,470
可恶  你们
Damn it. Damn it! Guys!

436
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,890
不好意思
Excuse me.

437
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,310
你们到底拍不拍了
Are we still doing this?

438
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,740
不  不拍了
No. No, we're not.

439
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,910
-现在拍吧  -准备好咯
- Now we are. - We're ready!

440
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,130
-说"茄子"  -"茄子"
- Say "cheese." - Say "cheese"!

441
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:19,750
68年我在理发店扫头发的时候
Back in '68, when I was sweeping up hair in that barbershop,

442
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,030
我曾幻想今后自己家庭的样子
I had this mental picture of the family that,

443
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,390
如果够走运的话
if I was lucky enough,

444
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:27,340
有一天我会坐拥完美的妻子  完美的孩子
one day I would end up with- perfect wife, perfect kids.

445
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,420
结果呢  我没那运气
Guess what. I didn't get any of that.

446
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,490
最后捞到这么一群二货
Wound up with this sorry bunch.

447
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,010
可我每天都对此充满感激
And I'm thankful for that every day.

448
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,740
大部分时候吧
Well, most days.

449
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,040
我还是就提猫王艾维斯的事好了
I think I'm just gonna go with the Elvis stuff.

450
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,390
换我也会
Yeah. I would.

451
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,130
右边点  右边点
Uh, to the right. To the right.

452
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,240
稍微往左一点点
A skosh to the left.

453
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,630
对了
There we go.

454
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,550
不管了  反正重刷墙壁的时候
Whatever. I'm gonna have to take the picture down

455
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,970
还是得把这幅照片取下来的
when I repaint the wall anyhow.

456
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,920
-杀了我吧  -什么
- Kill me now. - What?

457
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,460
我真是太幸运了
Don't know how I got so lucky.

458
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,530
爱你
I love you.

459
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,960
-我喜欢这张照片  -是啊
- I love that picture. - Yeah.

460
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,930
-相框那里是有个缺口吗  -没有没有
- Is that a chip on the frame right there? - No. No.

461
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,320
-我看得到  -亲爱的
- I can see it. - Honey.
