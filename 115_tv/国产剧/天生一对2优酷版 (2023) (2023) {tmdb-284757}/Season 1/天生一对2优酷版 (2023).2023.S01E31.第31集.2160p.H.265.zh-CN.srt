1
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,620
Ready to shoot

2
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,660
Run

3
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,860
Hurry

4
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,180
Run

5
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,860
Hurry

6
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,900
Hurry

7
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,700
Run

8
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:33,860
This way

9
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,460
Tomorrow noon 12 o' clock, get out of the city and surrender

10
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,660
Or on life will remain when we broke the city

11
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,060
Not even chicken or dogs

12
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,020
Surrender

13
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,260
Retreat

14
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,140
Open the gate and give in

15
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,180
Open the gate and give in

16
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,580
Or we will all die

17
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,380
Right

18
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,060
Surrender

19
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,180
As the guard of Hongchuan City

20
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,820
I won't allow anyone

21
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,540
stepping into our home

22
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,300
making our civilians slaves

23
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,020
even if I have to pay my life

24
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,820
Who are you?

25
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,100
The Xiuli Army

26
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,540
you command was the betrayers of Yan

27
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,340
How can we believe you?

28
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,020
Yeah. Right

29
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,100
How can we believe you?

30
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,100
Three years ago

31
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,300
the Xiuli Army was deceived by the evil Wei

32
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,660
to open the gate

33
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,500
Hongchuan was filled with blood

34
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,460
Their own family and friends died

35
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,980
as well

36
00:23:26,975 --> 00:23:28,100
All these years

37
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,860
they cannot even return to their home

38
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,940
They are not any less painful than

39
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,300
any of you

40
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,620
To return to our hometown

41
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,100
we gathered up together

42
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,700
experienced numerous battles

43
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,780
so that we could rush out of Chang'an

44
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,580
I trust them

45
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,020
And I plead you to

46
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,020
give them a chance as well

47
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,100
I promise you

48
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,780
If we can't defeat their attack tomorrow

49
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,340
the whole Xiuli Army and I

50
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,860
are willing to be tied by you

51
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,380
You can use us to surrender to Wei

52
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,620
I will keep my words

53
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,380
I won't make any resistance by then

54
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,940
Hongchuang is a old city

55
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,060
No updated equipment

56
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,700
When Cheng Yuan and Jiang Teng 

57
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,060
escaped from here

58
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,780
they took everything

59
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:23,860
Miss

60
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,660
what can we use to be our weapon now?

61
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:31,940
I have some

62
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,220
drafts of weapons in my hands now

63
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,420
We can use what we have here

64
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,380
and make weapons right now

65
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,940
Hope we can finish in time

66
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,820
We will defend here

67
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,180
as long as we can

68
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,260
Our goal in the battle

69
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,620
is not killing the enemies

70
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,380
But 

71
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,020
using the small-scale attack

72
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,540
to interrupt their steps to attack us

73
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,940
Holding down their spirit

74
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,180
Delaying their time on us

75
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,500
Time and patience

76
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,620
are the only weapon we own

77
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,580
As long as we can hang up for seven days

78
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,260
I believe

79
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,300
the reinforcements of the prince will arrive

80
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,140
Guys

81
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,460
The war is coming

82
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,380
No time to hesitate

83
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,020
Our country is in danger

84
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:19,660
Time to show our loyalty

85
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,500
As a soldier

86
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,180
the duty of protecting our land and people is

87
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,300
lying on our shoulder

88
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,980
No matter how this will end

89
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,420
we have no guilt to the land of Yan

90
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,220
to our own consciousness

91
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,620
to the vexillum

92
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,860
standing over us

93
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,860
To live or to die

94
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,500
We'll know after the battle

95
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:45,900
Guys

96
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,740
Please take care

97
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,260
Take care, Miss

98
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,620
Ge Qi?

99
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,740
General

100
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,780
You are not on duty today

101
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,300
Why don't you rest?

102
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,500
I can't sleep

103
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,100
Why?

104
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,100
What are you thinking?

105
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,580
I'm thinking

106
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,340
I've left home for so many years

107
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,140
Don't know my little wife

108
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,300
gave birth to a boy or a girl

109
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,700
Did she marry another man?

110
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,780
Don't know how's

111
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,540
my mom and dad now?

112
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,780
How about last time?

113
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,700
Last time

114
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,220
I did not enter their door at all

115
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,020
because I am still

116
00:27:54,125 --> 00:27:55,220
under the title of traitors

117
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,620
I understand

118
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,460
I really hope

119
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,060
I can survive this war

120
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,100
And the prince will

121
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,460
remove our title as betrayers

122
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,780
I can go home

123
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,980
with honor

124
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,780
Don't worry, buddy

125
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,500
I believe

126
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,980
we will make it

127
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,260
Get out

128
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:17,980
Who are you?

129
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,060
You are so young

130
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,580
Why don't you leave with those people?

131
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,125
We know each other

132
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,940
Last time before the drug store

133
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,660
one of your brother 

134
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,940
help me pay the medicine

135
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,220
You are not sending me away?

136
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,820
Your choice to live or die

137
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,420
is none of my business

138
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,820
I am pretty busy everyday

139
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,100
Things of you little kid is not my work

140
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,260
Little kid?

141
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,620
I... I

142
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,100
I am fifteen this year

143
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,260
I can go on the battlefield to kill enemies

144
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,220
I...

145
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,620
Look at me

146
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,100
How strong I am

147
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,260
Why didn't you leave 

148
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,540
with them?

149
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,340
My mother is sick. She can't move

150
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,980
Don't send us away

151
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,660
I can guard the city with you

152
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,620
Help you kill the evil

153
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,300
Tell me, what's your name?

154
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,100
I'm Puppy Du

155
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,940
A good boy as you

156
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,860
Why they call you like this?

157
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,780
My grandmother gave me this name

158
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:41,140
She said one with humble name is easier to raise

159
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,100
If fact

160
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,180
I feel this name doesn't

161
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,460
sound good too

162
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,940
How about you think of a new one for me?

163
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,340
But my surname must be Du

164
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,220
How about Pingan?
