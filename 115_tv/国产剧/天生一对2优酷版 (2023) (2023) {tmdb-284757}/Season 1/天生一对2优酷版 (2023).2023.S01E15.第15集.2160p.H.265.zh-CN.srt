1
00:00:08,265 --> 00:00:09,665
Oh, you just heard gossip.

2
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:10,666
No, I didn't.

3
00:00:10,734 --> 00:00:11,734
Yes, you did.

4
00:00:11,802 --> 00:00:13,269
I know your gossip face.

5
00:00:13,337 --> 00:00:14,637
Gossip and turkey pastrami.

6
00:00:14,705 --> 00:00:16,072
It's gonna be a great night.

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,707
- No!  - Tell it.

8
00:00:17,775 --> 00:00:18,941
- Burt, I...  - Spill it.

9
00:00:19,009 --> 00:00:20,243
- I promised...  - Don't fight it, let it out.

10
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,011
Ah! Fine, but you can't tell anyone else.

11
00:00:24,848 --> 00:00:25,715
Ah!

12
00:00:25,783 --> 00:00:26,849
We swim in that pool!

13
00:00:26,917 --> 00:00:28,117
I know, right?

14
00:00:28,185 --> 00:00:29,385
Wha... you know what?

15
00:00:29,453 --> 00:00:30,586
Nothing.

16
00:00:30,654 --> 00:00:32,188
Oh, you got gossip. Come on.

17
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,089
- No.  - Tell it.

18
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:33,689
Stop!

19
00:00:33,757 --> 00:00:34,624
Let it out, let it out, let it out.

20
00:00:34,691 --> 00:00:35,925
Damn it!

21
00:00:35,993 --> 00:00:37,727
Dancin' Dan and Whistlin' Sue

22
00:00:37,795 --> 00:00:39,395
have been hooking up at the Rec Center.

23
00:00:39,463 --> 00:00:41,998
I found out from Government Conspiracy Gordon.

24
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:45,735
Boy, the homeless people in this town have great nicknames.

25
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:03,820
Morning, Mrs. Chance, Mr. Chance.

26
00:01:03,887 --> 00:01:05,588
Hey, Tyler, what's up?

27
00:01:05,656 --> 00:01:08,457
Still reeling from that 13th astrological sign.

28
00:01:08,525 --> 00:01:10,960
Kind of need to reevaluate a lot of things

29
00:01:11,028 --> 00:01:12,461
and remove a tattoo.

30
00:01:12,529 --> 00:01:14,697
I think he meant what's up with the wrench.

31
00:01:14,765 --> 00:01:16,499
Oh, yeah!

32
00:01:16,567 --> 00:01:18,501
I am so, so sorry to bother you,

33
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:20,570
but I have to shut off your gas.

34
00:01:20,637 --> 00:01:22,405
The gas bill cannot be overdue.

35
00:01:22,472 --> 00:01:24,273
I always go into the check cashing place

36
00:01:24,341 --> 00:01:26,843
next door to the pharmacy and I pay it while I'm waiting

37
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,644
for them to refill Maw Maw's prescription.

38
00:01:28,712 --> 00:01:30,746
And I always remember to get her new pills

39
00:01:30,814 --> 00:01:33,416
when I have to go into the bathroom cupboard for a tampon.

40
00:01:33,483 --> 00:01:35,351
And since my friend has not arrived yet,

41
00:01:35,419 --> 00:01:37,320
the gas bill cannot be late.

42
00:01:37,387 --> 00:01:39,322
It says here you're two weeks late.

43
00:01:44,261 --> 00:01:45,862
Oh, good Lord, I'm two weeks late!

44
00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:48,297
You mean late late?

45
00:01:48,365 --> 00:01:50,766
Like, late late?

46
00:01:52,336 --> 00:01:53,469
You know what?

47
00:01:54,805 --> 00:01:56,172
I'm just gonna check this box

48
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,040
that says "loose dog in the yard."

49
00:01:58,108 --> 00:02:01,444
That should buy you about a week or two.

50
00:02:01,511 --> 00:02:02,912
Man, this is crazy.

51
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,380
We're always so careful.

52
00:02:04,448 --> 00:02:06,515
Sometimes we're so careful, it's not even that fun.

53
00:02:07,684 --> 00:02:09,285
The drive-through car wash.

54
00:02:09,353 --> 00:02:10,953
Oh, man.

55
00:02:11,021 --> 00:02:12,688
That was so beautiful though

56
00:02:12,756 --> 00:02:14,790
with the multicolored soap running down the windows.

57
00:02:14,858 --> 00:02:16,459
What are we gonna do?

58
00:02:16,526 --> 00:02:17,426
We cannot afford...

59
00:02:18,462 --> 00:02:20,630
Fairlane.

60
00:02:20,697 --> 00:02:23,399
I am telling you, Ford Fairlane

61
00:02:23,467 --> 00:02:25,835
is Andrew Dice Clay's best movie.

62
00:02:25,903 --> 00:02:27,003
How can you say that?

63
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,170
He was in Pretty in Pink.

64
00:02:28,238 --> 00:02:29,872
Uh, doesn't count.

65
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,674
He wasn't Andrew Dice Clay then.

66
00:02:31,742 --> 00:02:34,076
Jimmy, back me up on this.

67
00:02:34,144 --> 00:02:36,145
Dad, I've told you a hundred times,

68
00:02:36,213 --> 00:02:39,382
I have no idea who Andrew Dice Clay is.

69
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,854
Nice job covering.

70
00:02:44,922 --> 00:02:46,355
Oh, my God, Burt.

71
00:02:46,423 --> 00:02:48,391
We cannot have another baby.

72
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,192
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's... Let's not freak out

73
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,094
- until we know for sure.  - You're right.

74
00:02:52,162 --> 00:02:53,796
But still, Jimmy cannot find out about this.

75
00:02:53,864 --> 00:02:56,432
I love making fun of his unplanned pregnancy.

76
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,934
I don't want to lose that.

77
00:02:58,001 --> 00:02:59,368
Yeah, we can't just go back to

78
00:02:59,436 --> 00:03:00,703
making fun of his stupid T-shirts.

79
00:03:00,771 --> 00:03:02,204
It's not as rich an area.

80
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,639
I'll go to the free clinic today,

81
00:03:03,707 --> 00:03:04,941
and I'll find out what's going on.

82
00:03:05,008 --> 00:03:07,977
Until then, mum's the word.

83
00:03:08,045 --> 00:03:10,813
Got it.

84
00:03:10,881 --> 00:03:13,549
Why does my room smell like old people?

85
00:03:15,218 --> 00:03:17,687
Because yesterday we let an old person go in there.

86
00:03:17,754 --> 00:03:18,888
Oh.

87
00:03:18,956 --> 00:03:20,656
Thank God. I thought it was me.

88
00:03:27,664 --> 00:03:30,232
Hey, would you grab that for me?

89
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,503
"Free clinic"? Why is the...

90
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:35,538
I got it!

91
00:03:37,307 --> 00:03:38,774
Hello.

92
00:03:38,842 --> 00:03:41,677
Hey. Uh, I'm filling out this form at the free clinic,

93
00:03:41,745 --> 00:03:43,546
and I need to know your mother's maiden name.

94
00:03:43,613 --> 00:03:44,814
Chance.

95
00:03:44,881 --> 00:03:45,848
No, her maiden name.

96
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,249
Like, before she was married.

97
00:03:47,317 --> 00:03:48,217
Chance.

98
00:03:48,285 --> 00:03:49,285
Really?

99
00:03:49,353 --> 00:03:50,519
Wow.

100
00:03:50,587 --> 00:03:53,189
Third cousins, big drinkers, things happen.

101
00:03:53,256 --> 00:03:54,623
Okay, then.

102
00:03:54,691 --> 00:03:56,092
I'll call you when I know something.

103
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,227
Okay.

104
00:03:58,295 --> 00:03:59,562
What was that?

105
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:00,529
Wrong number.

106
00:04:00,597 --> 00:04:01,797
It said "free clinic,"

107
00:04:01,865 --> 00:04:03,432
and it took too long for a wrong number.

108
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,568
Yeah, well, I like human contact, Jimmy.

109
00:04:05,635 --> 00:04:07,169
Dog contact, too.

110
00:04:07,237 --> 00:04:08,371
Cats are good.

111
00:04:08,438 --> 00:04:09,438
Birds make me nervous.

112
00:04:15,078 --> 00:04:15,945
When can she be here?

113
00:04:16,013 --> 00:04:18,614
Yeah, I have to go. I have to call you back.

114
00:04:18,682 --> 00:04:20,616
- Jesse! You want me to come back there? - Excuse me.

115
00:04:20,684 --> 00:04:22,018
I've been sitting, waiting for my results...

116
00:04:22,085 --> 00:04:23,486
We were just about to call you back.

117
00:04:23,553 --> 00:04:25,755
Uh, please take a seat in area seven, okay?

118
00:04:36,466 --> 00:04:37,900
Hey.

119
00:04:37,968 --> 00:04:40,336
Oh. Hey!

120
00:04:40,404 --> 00:04:42,405
You here for the-the flu shot, too?

121
00:04:42,472 --> 00:04:45,041
Yes, I am. Yeah.

122
00:04:45,108 --> 00:04:47,977
Don't have to be a bird to get the bird flu.  

123
00:04:48,045 --> 00:04:49,512
Or so they say in the pamphlets.

124
00:04:52,482 --> 00:04:54,183
Good news. You're not pregnant.

125
00:04:55,318 --> 00:04:56,819
Here's a pamphlet describing over

126
00:04:56,887 --> 00:04:58,721
20 kinds of birth control we can provide to you.

127
00:04:58,789 --> 00:05:00,122
Seven of which have not worked for me.

128
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,661
Well, we got the same result

129
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:07,563
from the pregnancy test you took at home:

130
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:09,031
inconclusive.

131
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:10,166
I say, wait five more days

132
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:11,967
and try the home test again.

133
00:05:19,461 --> 00:05:22,930
Sorry I lied. It's just that we didn't tell Jimmy.

134
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:26,141
It would be really bad for me if he found out,

135
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,027
I didn't want to burden you with my secret.

136
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,995
Oh, no, no, no, I totally understand.

137
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,830
I don't want everybody at the grocery store

138
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:33,265
gossiping about my business.

139
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,900
I'd really appreciate it if you just

140
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:37,236
didn't mention my thing to Jimmy either.

141
00:05:39,497 --> 00:05:41,965
Okay?

142
00:05:43,966 --> 00:05:45,969
I'd like to... I really would.

143
00:05:46,037 --> 00:05:49,973
But I'm not great at holding on to gossip, so...

144
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,542
How hard can it be?

145
00:05:51,609 --> 00:05:53,844
You're an adult, just don't say anything.

146
00:05:53,912 --> 00:05:55,679
But Burt and Jimmy always know

147
00:05:55,747 --> 00:05:57,715
when I've got something really juicy.

148
00:05:57,782 --> 00:06:00,050
Plus, I got to be honest, after cleaning toilets

149
00:06:00,118 --> 00:06:04,455
all day, delivering gossip just makes me feel special.

150
00:06:04,522 --> 00:06:05,589
You know?

151
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,991
Like those cool scumbags on TMZ.

152
00:06:08,059 --> 00:06:09,360
But you don't want Jimmy to find out

153
00:06:09,427 --> 00:06:11,462
about your pregnancy scare, right?

154
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:12,496
God, no.

155
00:06:12,564 --> 00:06:14,131
- That would be awful.  - Okay.

156
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,300
Well, if you blab my secret, I'll blab yours.

157
00:06:18,368 --> 00:06:19,868
Are you blackmailing me?

158
00:06:20,929 --> 00:06:24,232
I guess I am, yeah.

159
00:06:24,549 --> 00:06:27,084
Damn, I like you.

160
00:06:27,152 --> 00:06:28,620
Is someone sick?

161
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,822
No! I told you, no.

162
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,691
Then just tell me why the free clinic called,

163
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,792
and I'll leave you alone.

164
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,994
Fine.

165
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,687
I'm donating a kidney to the mayor.

166
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,391
Why would you be giving a kidney to the mayor?

167
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:42,993
You voted for the other guy.

168
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,495
Can't you put petty politics aside for one day, Jimmy?

169
00:06:45,563 --> 00:06:46,997
The man's life is at stake.

170
00:06:47,064 --> 00:06:48,231
The mayor's a woman.

171
00:06:48,299 --> 00:06:50,233
Can't you just let me have this?

172
00:06:50,301 --> 00:06:52,736
This is as close as I'll ever get to being mayor!

173
00:06:52,803 --> 00:06:55,438
I'm not letting this go!

174
00:07:01,412 --> 00:07:02,946
Hello?

175
00:07:03,014 --> 00:07:04,414
Burt, it's negative.

176
00:07:04,482 --> 00:07:05,815
I'm not pregnant!

177
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:06,816
Mom?

178
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,451
Why would you be pregnant?

179
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:10,620
No es mommy. Estoy Rosa.

180
00:07:10,688 --> 00:07:12,088
It's my phone!

181
00:07:12,156 --> 00:07:14,691
Don't answer my phone!

182
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,994
Do you have any idea how crazy your behavior was?

183
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,163
You already had one giant mistake,

184
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,699
me... wasn't that enough to teach you? Huh?

185
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:25,201
I mean, it's not like we have enough space or money for another kid.

186
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:27,570
How could you be so unresponsible?

187
00:07:27,638 --> 00:07:29,673
We're responsible.

188
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,575
We're just also passionate and spontaneous.

189
00:07:32,643 --> 00:07:34,244
Those would be our gladiator names

190
00:07:34,312 --> 00:07:35,912
if we were on American Gladiator.

191
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,547
Which we still might do.

192
00:07:37,615 --> 00:07:39,416
Because we're spontaneous.

193
00:07:39,483 --> 00:07:42,419
Okay, first of all, Gladiator sounds awesome.

194
00:07:42,486 --> 00:07:44,287
But no babies.

195
00:07:44,355 --> 00:07:46,456
One of you has to get fixed or spayed.

196
00:07:46,524 --> 00:07:47,524
No way!

197
00:07:47,591 --> 00:07:49,025
You cannot decide that, Jimmy.

198
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,627
That is a personal decision.

199
00:07:50,695 --> 00:07:51,795
She's right.

200
00:07:51,862 --> 00:07:53,630
I think we should take a family vote.

201
00:07:53,698 --> 00:07:55,031
All those in favor

202
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,599
of everyone keeping their original plumbling?

203
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:58,969
Sorry, Jimmy,

204
00:07:59,036 --> 00:08:00,503
you're outvoted two to one.

205
00:08:00,571 --> 00:08:02,072
I vote with Jimmy.

206
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:03,940
Hold on. Two to two.

207
00:08:04,008 --> 00:08:05,742
Only if she's lucid.

208
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:06,943
She's only allowed to vote if she's lucid.

209
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:08,244
Maw Maw...

210
00:08:08,312 --> 00:08:11,314
we are currently at war with what country?

211
00:08:11,382 --> 00:08:13,616
Iraq and Afghanistan.

212
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:16,086
Is she right?

213
00:08:16,153 --> 00:08:17,887
I think so, but I'm not sure.

214
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,656
It's right, you morons.

215
00:08:19,724 --> 00:08:22,192
One more reason why you shouldn't have another baby.

216
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:25,028
Look, we're five people

217
00:08:25,096 --> 00:08:27,130
living in a four-person house.

218
00:08:27,198 --> 00:08:28,798
We need another baby

219
00:08:28,866 --> 00:08:31,267
like we need a gorilla throwing fireworks.

220
00:08:32,536 --> 00:08:34,604
I change my vote.

221
00:08:34,672 --> 00:08:36,473
What? Now you're on their side?

222
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,274
It's not a horrible idea.

223
00:08:38,342 --> 00:08:41,544
And she's right... another baby would not be good for any of us.

224
00:08:41,612 --> 00:08:44,080
Yes! That's three votes... now we just have to decide...

225
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,448
- Not it! Not it!  - Tie.

226
00:08:45,516 --> 00:08:47,150
We'll have to do a coin toss. Mom, call it.

227
00:08:47,218 --> 00:08:48,952
Okay, heads, I win, tails, you lose?

228
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,220
Uh, uh...

229
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,090
Tails, you lose.

230
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,392
Damn it!

231
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:56,693
I never win coin tosses!

232
00:09:03,493 --> 00:09:05,527
We got a problem.

233
00:09:05,595 --> 00:09:06,162
What?

234
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,964
This morning I realized

235
00:09:08,032 --> 00:09:10,467
that Jimmy found out about my pregnancy scare,

236
00:09:10,534 --> 00:09:12,068
and there was absolutely nothing

237
00:09:12,136 --> 00:09:14,604
to keep me from telling him your secret.

238
00:09:14,672 --> 00:09:16,112
How are we supposed to pay for this?

239
00:09:16,215 --> 00:09:18,283
I found a doctor who agreed to do it for free

240
00:09:18,351 --> 00:09:20,152
if we clean his pool for a year.

241
00:09:20,469 --> 00:09:22,504
I knew I had to get out of there

242
00:09:22,571 --> 00:09:26,408
before they saw my face, but my car keys were in the kitchen.

243
00:09:26,475 --> 00:09:27,642
How big's his pool?

244
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,676
Medium size.

245
00:09:28,744 --> 00:09:30,578
So am I.

246
00:09:30,846 --> 00:09:32,347
Sounds fair.

247
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,915
Just don't tell me when it is... too stressful.

248
00:09:33,983 --> 00:09:36,651
Just pick a date and surprise me.

249
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:41,623
I'm not gonna be able to keep your secret.

250
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:44,359
If they had seen my face, it'd already be out.

251
00:09:44,427 --> 00:09:46,494
Then you need to tell me another secret.

252
00:09:46,562 --> 00:09:48,897
Something good and juicy,

253
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,365
you know, like a...

254
00:09:50,433 --> 00:09:53,168
a summer camp sexual experimentation secret.

255
00:09:53,235 --> 00:09:56,404
Did you just tell me another secret?

256
00:09:57,606 --> 00:09:59,073
No.

257
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:00,708
All right.

258
00:10:03,946 --> 00:10:05,747
This truly is

259
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:09,217
my deepest, darkest secret.

260
00:10:09,285 --> 00:10:11,119
Okay.

261
00:10:11,312 --> 00:10:14,847
There is a sex tape of me and Burt floating around town,

262
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,783
- and he doesn't know about it.  - Wow!

263
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,751
You guys are a regular Pam and Tommy Lee.

264
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:20,053
Oh, no.

265
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,921
Don't get me wrong, Burt's no slouch,

266
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:24,057
but he can't steer a boat.

267
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:27,527
Anyway, about five years ago, me and Burt were having a fight,

268
00:10:27,595 --> 00:10:30,863
so I gave away his bootleg copy of Fast and the Furious,

269
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:32,966
only the tapes got switched,

270
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:35,435
and I gave away our sex tape.

271
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:37,136
Okay. Great.

272
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:39,339
Now, picture me telling Burt.

273
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:40,640
I'd be mortified.

274
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:44,243
Damn, you're good with this blackmail thing.

275
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,245
I really think we can be friends.

276
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:52,452
Oh, this is gonna be so sweet!

277
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:55,922
We've hardly been to the Arcade at all since Hope was born.

278
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,591
- Surprise... it's vasectomy day.  - Aw, damn it!

279
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:01,794
I knew when you told me to wear my good underwear to play Asteroids...

280
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:02,962
something was up!

281
00:11:04,565 --> 00:11:07,533
After the local anesthetic has numbed the area,

282
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:09,936
I'll make one or two small incisions

283
00:11:10,004 --> 00:11:12,805
from which I will disconnect the gonads.

284
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,807
- Who are they?  - The gonads.

285
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,343
Your boys, your plums, you know, family jewels.

286
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:18,411
No.

287
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:19,679
Who are they?

288
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:21,080
Oh, oh,

289
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:22,615
those are my students.

290
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:24,550
I teach English as a second language

291
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:26,052
at the Community Center... guys, come

292
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,553
a little bit closer... I want you to get a better look.

293
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:29,522
Now, this...

294
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,290
- is a penis.  - I am out of here.

295
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:32,892
Dad, we had a deal.

296
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,328
Yep, yep, it's a deal you're not backing out of.

297
00:11:35,396 --> 00:11:36,595
My pool's not turning green just because

298
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:38,731
you're getting a case of cold walnuts.

299
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,599
Jimmy, give me my pants

300
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,400
- I can't do this. - Nuh-uh

301
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:41,534
Mr. Chance,

302
00:11:41,602 --> 00:11:42,535
would you like a breath mint?

303
00:11:42,603 --> 00:11:43,569
Yeah.

304
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:48,241
- Oh, this tastes awful. - Oh, that's because it's a sedative.

305
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:49,575
In about five minutes,

306
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:51,511
you'll let me do anything I want down there.

307
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:54,013
And that's how easy it is to get roofied.

308
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:56,416
That should act as a cautionary lesson...

309
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:59,719
for the girls, not as an instructional lesson for the guys.

310
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:06,993
Jimmy...

311
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:09,128
you know how your mother and I

312
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:11,297
always told you that drugs were bad?

313
00:12:11,365 --> 00:12:14,067
- Yeah. - We were wrong.

314
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:16,469
This stuff's amazing.

315
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:21,774
It's like I'm floating and sinking at the same time.

316
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:23,242
I'm flinking.

317
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:26,612
Just do me a favor.

318
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,247
Don't tell Jimmy.

319
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:29,449
Okay.

320
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:31,951
All righty.

321
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:33,419
Let's get this started.

322
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:35,088
- Yeah. - First thing I need to do

323
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:37,256
is a little shaving in the surgical area.

324
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:38,858
Whoa, no, no, no, no.

325
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:41,094
- That's not gonna happen, partner. - Well...

326
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:43,563
if you're uncomfortable with another man doing it,

327
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,099
we could ask one of my female students... she's Asian.

328
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,101
No! That would be worse!

329
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:50,870
Only one woman shaves me down there... that's my wife.

330
00:12:52,573 --> 00:12:55,041
Only once.

331
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:56,743
I wanted to see what it looked like.

332
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,278
I don't recommend it.

333
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:01,414
Tell you what, give me the razor... I'll do it myself.

334
00:13:01,482 --> 00:13:04,517
No, no, no, I can't give a razor to a man who's on sedatives.

335
00:13:04,585 --> 00:13:05,885
How about him? He'll do it.

336
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:07,653
Whoa, I don't think...

337
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:09,622
Well, let's go home, then.

338
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,660
Ooh, that tickles.

339
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:16,362
Oh, Dad, come on!

340
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,964
Oh, sorry.

341
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:20,533
I forgot that was you down there for a second.

342
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:24,437
It isn't so bad.

343
00:13:24,505 --> 00:13:27,807
They should have places that do this in the Mall.

344
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,842
They could call it Bush-Whackers.

345
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:34,113
Hey, I know... as soon as you're finished, I'll do you.

346
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:36,182
I'm good.

347
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:41,354
Jimmy, I just realized...

348
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:44,824
in a couple of days, I'm gonna have a prickly pair.

349
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:46,726
That's great, Dad.

350
00:13:46,794 --> 00:13:48,127
Can't wait.

351
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:50,530
Hey, buddy.

352
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:52,999
You remember that time you shaved me?

353
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:54,400
Yes! Because I'm still doing it.

354
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:57,203
Ah, we got so many fun times together.

355
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:03,242
# People, let me tell you #

356
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,077
# 'Bout my best friend #

357
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:07,713
# He's a warmhearted person #

358
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:10,416
# Who'll love me to the end #

359
00:14:10,484 --> 00:14:13,319
# People let me tell you 'bout my best friend #

360
00:14:13,387 --> 00:14:15,588
# He's the one boy, cuddly toy #

361
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:17,990
# My up, my down, my pride and joy #

362
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:19,992
# People, let me tell you about him #

363
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,794
# He's so much fun #

364
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,696
# Whether we're talkin' man to man #

365
00:14:23,764 --> 00:14:25,698
# Or whether we're talkin' son to son #

366
00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:29,368
#'Cause he's my best friend #

367
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:30,770
#Yeah, he's my #

368
00:14:30,838 --> 00:14:32,705
# best friend #

369
00:14:32,773 --> 00:14:35,041
# La, ba-da, ba-da, ya #

370
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,042
# Ba, da-ba #

371
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:39,345
# Da, ya, ba-da, ba-da, ya #

372
00:14:39,413 --> 00:14:40,746
# Ba, da, ba-da... #

373
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,094
Oh, those were good times.

374
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:58,130
Hey, buddy, you remember that time you shaved my...

375
00:14:58,198 --> 00:14:59,265
Please just stop talking.

376
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,133
All right.

377
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:04,003
Let's sever some vas deferens.

378
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:05,037
Hey, Jimmy.

379
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:06,038
Yeah?

380
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:07,707
Pull my finger.

381
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:08,774
I really don't think so.

382
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:10,610
- Come on, buddy. - No!

383
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:13,212
I don't want to... I had to drag you in from the car,

384
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,847
I had to hold you down on the bed,

385
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:15,915
I had to shave you

386
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:17,817
below your waist. I am not lifting,

387
00:15:17,885 --> 00:15:21,454
moving, tugging or pulling anything else of yours today.

388
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:24,156
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go to the bathroom

389
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:25,558
and wash my eyes.

390
00:15:49,696 --> 00:15:51,731
We have another problem.

391
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:56,203
Last night, we were having a normal dinner

392
00:15:56,771 --> 00:15:58,705
fish for Friday.

393
00:15:58,773 --> 00:16:00,807
For the first time in days,

394
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,909
I actually forgot about your situation.

395
00:16:02,977 --> 00:16:06,012
I could feel calm...  but I was too calm.

396
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,848
So, anything interesting happen to anyone today?

397
00:16:09,316 --> 00:16:10,416
Any gossip?

398
00:16:12,053 --> 00:16:13,286
He said "gossip"?

399
00:16:13,354 --> 00:16:14,354
- Yes!  - No.

400
00:16:14,422 --> 00:16:15,420
- Yes!  - God!

401
00:16:15,422 --> 00:16:16,056
I know!

402
00:16:16,123 --> 00:16:17,657
Soon as I heard that,

403
00:16:17,725 --> 00:16:19,926
the gossip started to fight its way out.

404
00:16:19,994 --> 00:16:22,562
I saw some pretty cool out-of-state license plates today.

405
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,730
Do tell.

406
00:16:23,798 --> 00:16:25,065
Well, I saw this Alaskan one.

407
00:16:25,132 --> 00:16:26,900
I felt like I had an armadillo

408
00:16:26,968 --> 00:16:29,436
inside me trying to claw its way out.

409
00:16:29,503 --> 00:16:31,371
I looked away, and I kept telling myself...

410
00:16:31,439 --> 00:16:32,872
Sex tape. Sex tape.

411
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,474
But then I looked at Hope,

412
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:36,209
and I was back to thinking "baby".

413
00:16:36,277 --> 00:16:38,545
I just lost it!

414
00:16:39,714 --> 00:16:41,314
Oh, look.

415
00:16:41,382 --> 00:16:42,716
Look...

416
00:16:42,783 --> 00:16:44,117
she's got something.

417
00:16:44,185 --> 00:16:45,518
- Mama's got a secret.  - Mm-mm.

418
00:16:45,586 --> 00:16:47,187
No, I don't.

419
00:16:47,254 --> 00:16:48,355
Yes, you do.

420
00:16:48,422 --> 00:16:50,323
Come on, spill it, spill it.

421
00:16:50,391 --> 00:16:51,758
Spill it, spill it, spill it.

422
00:16:51,826 --> 00:16:52,692
Just let it out...

423
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,995
I lost our sex tape!

424
00:16:55,062 --> 00:16:57,831
- You told your own secret?  - I had to!

425
00:16:57,898 --> 00:17:00,734
They knew I had gossip, and they weren't gonna stop until I told them something.

426
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:03,269
And the only other secret I could think of other than yours was mine.

427
00:17:03,337 --> 00:17:04,704
What was Burt's reaction?

428
00:17:04,772 --> 00:17:06,239
Not what I expected.

429
00:17:09,343 --> 00:17:11,578
Somebody's sitting down to watch Vin Diesel,

430
00:17:11,646 --> 00:17:13,780
and they're gonna see my wiener!

431
00:17:15,883 --> 00:17:19,052
'Cause it looks a little like Vin Diesel.  

432
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,287
So, what happened with my secret?

433
00:17:21,355 --> 00:17:23,790
Nothing. I just bit my tongue for the rest of the night.

434
00:17:23,858 --> 00:17:25,592
Look, it's still bleeding a little.

435
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,093
But I can't

436
00:17:27,161 --> 00:17:29,462
do that every day, so, listen, if you're really pregnant,

437
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,064
we're just gonna have to agree

438
00:17:31,132 --> 00:17:32,799
to tell people sooner rather than later.

439
00:17:32,867 --> 00:17:35,402
Well... I've been putting this off,

440
00:17:35,469 --> 00:17:37,303
but... I guess it's time.

441
00:17:38,372 --> 00:17:39,239
Let's go.

442
00:17:42,209 --> 00:17:44,944
Someone's in here.

443
00:17:48,449 --> 00:17:49,549
Sabrina, hurry.

444
00:17:49,617 --> 00:17:51,084
They were giving out coffee samples

445
00:17:51,152 --> 00:17:54,120
in the store, and there's a line of cheap, jittery women outside.

446
00:17:55,756 --> 00:17:57,490
I don't have a baby!

447
00:17:57,558 --> 00:17:59,392
And I don't have a secret!

448
00:18:04,965 --> 00:18:06,599
Oh, hey, Tyler.

449
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:08,635
- You work here, too, huh?  - Oh, yeah.

450
00:18:08,703 --> 00:18:11,271
Between the propane and the wind and the solar,

451
00:18:11,338 --> 00:18:12,806
who knows how long

452
00:18:12,873 --> 00:18:14,908
natural gas is gonna be around for.

453
00:18:14,975 --> 00:18:17,610
But Pac-Man, that's forever.

454
00:18:19,313 --> 00:18:20,980
- You looking for your pops?  - Yeah.

455
00:18:21,048 --> 00:18:22,248
Photo booth.

456
00:18:25,853 --> 00:18:27,420
Dad, I know you're in there.

457
00:18:27,488 --> 00:18:29,322
- Just come on out.  - No!

458
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,791
If he's not gonna come out, he's got to take some pictures.

459
00:18:40,601 --> 00:18:43,570
I know you're afraid about going through with this, Dad.

460
00:18:43,637 --> 00:18:46,139
I'm not afraid. After the pill that guy gave me,

461
00:18:46,207 --> 00:18:48,875
you could've examined my prostate, I wouldn't even have flinched.

462
00:18:48,943 --> 00:18:50,143
You did.

463
00:18:50,211 --> 00:18:51,277
See?

464
00:18:54,982 --> 00:18:56,449
Then why did you run?

465
00:18:56,517 --> 00:18:58,218
Because you refused to pull my finger.

466
00:18:58,285 --> 00:19:02,155
But, Dad, it was a long, hard day.

467
00:19:02,223 --> 00:19:04,023
I just wasn't in the mood for goofing around.

468
00:19:04,091 --> 00:19:05,525
I'm worried about us growing apart.

469
00:19:05,593 --> 00:19:07,160
I know you'll always be my son,

470
00:19:07,228 --> 00:19:09,262
but I don't know you'll always be my buddy.

471
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:11,264
What?

472
00:19:11,332 --> 00:19:14,667
Look... I know I'm like Mad magazine...

473
00:19:14,935 --> 00:19:17,303
my audience is a pretty specific age,

474
00:19:17,371 --> 00:19:19,706
probably, like, ten to 17.

475
00:19:19,774 --> 00:19:22,142
You're 22 now... you got a kid of your own.

476
00:19:22,209 --> 00:19:24,511
You might be outgrowing the Burt Show.

477
00:19:24,578 --> 00:19:27,814
Having you was the best thing that ever happened to me.

478
00:19:27,882 --> 00:19:30,583
But if you outgrew me, I'd like to have the option

479
00:19:30,651 --> 00:19:32,352
to make another little buddy.

480
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:40,193
Wait. Having me was the best thing that ever happened to you?

481
00:19:40,261 --> 00:19:42,028
Greatest day of my life.

482
00:19:42,096 --> 00:19:44,664
Well, I always figured that since I was a mistake,

483
00:19:44,732 --> 00:19:47,634
you guys would rather I turned out to be a pregnancy scare.

484
00:19:47,826 --> 00:19:49,861
Of course not.

485
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:52,096
I will always be your buddy.

486
00:19:52,164 --> 00:19:53,631
And I promise

487
00:19:53,699 --> 00:19:56,801
I will never get tired of the Burt Show.

488
00:19:58,203 --> 00:20:00,672
I'm not a machine, Jimmy.

489
00:20:00,739 --> 00:20:02,507
I need a little time to...

490
00:20:02,574 --> 00:20:03,875
Hold it. Wait.

491
00:20:03,943 --> 00:20:05,543
Okay, now!

492
00:20:11,617 --> 00:20:14,352
When Dad realized that he truly had a buddy for life,

493
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,954
he happily went through with the vasectomy.

494
00:20:16,021 --> 00:20:18,456
- Time to switch.  - These are still pretty cold.

495
00:20:18,524 --> 00:20:21,693
Yeah, but Mom needs the peas for the shepherd's pie.

496
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,631
Berries.

497
00:20:26,699 --> 00:20:28,132
He wasn't the only one who learned

498
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,535
that having a buddy you can trust is a cool thing.

499
00:20:30,602 --> 00:20:32,937
Now that you know about my summer at sleepaway camp,

500
00:20:33,005 --> 00:20:34,872
now you got to tell me something about you.

501
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,039
Oh. Remember that time somebody

502
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,610
knocked over the statue at the black church,

503
00:20:39,678 --> 00:20:42,547
everybody thought it was a hate crime?

504
00:20:42,614 --> 00:20:46,684
That was the day I taught myself how to drive a stick shift.

505
00:20:48,554 --> 00:20:49,921
I learned something, too.

506
00:20:49,989 --> 00:20:52,056
Even though I was a mistake,

507
00:20:52,124 --> 00:20:55,093
I'm a mistake my parents would gladly make again.

508
00:21:00,431 --> 00:21:04,268
And that is something you and I definitely have in common.

509
00:21:04,336 --> 00:21:07,638
I couldn't have planned how you came to me in a million years.

510
00:21:07,706 --> 00:21:09,207
But I always want you to know,

511
00:21:09,274 --> 00:21:11,209
you're the best thing that ever happened to me.

512
00:21:11,276 --> 00:21:14,212
Which is why I'm going to teach you a Chance family tradition.

513
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:16,381
Pull my finger.

514
00:21:16,448 --> 00:21:17,682
Come on.

515
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,384
Pull it!

516
00:21:19,451 --> 00:21:21,052
Here.

517
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,221
Like this.
