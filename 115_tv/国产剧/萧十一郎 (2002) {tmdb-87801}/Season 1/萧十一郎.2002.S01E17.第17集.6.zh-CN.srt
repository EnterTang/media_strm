she  wasn't gonna  let  me  out

303
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,805
Would  you  stop talkin'
about  her  like  she's  real?

304
00:15:42,805 --> 00:15:44,773
-You're  weirdin'  me  out.
－Let  me tell  you  something…

305
00:15:44,773 --> 00:15:46,875
you  know  she's  not  real  
l  know  she's  not  real…

306
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,577
but Cindy sees things
a  little  differently

307
00:15:48,577 --> 00:15:51,447
She's  a  series
of ones  and  zeros

308
00:15:51,447 --> 00:15:54,917
Ones  and  zeros  wrapped  in
the  cutest    hottest  little  body

309
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:56,085
Would  you  stop  it?

310
00:15:56,085 --> 00:15:57,814
l  feel  guilty enough
as  it  is

311
00:15:59,188 --> 00:16:01,991
But  not as  guilty as  l'd  feel
if  Sam  ever finds  out

312
00:16:01,991 --> 00:16:03,225
Sam's  a  software  developer

313
00:16:03,225 --> 00:16:05,060
She'd  probably think
Cindy was  pretty damn  cool

314
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,462
Don't you  get  it?
We  made  a  vow－－

315
00:16:06,462 --> 00:16:07,663
no  sex  until  our  wedding

316
00:16:07,663 --> 00:16:10,299
That  means  not with  each  other  
not with  others    and  not with…

317
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:12,067
some  sex－happy computer  program

318
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:14,069
Your  loss.  Your  loss

319
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:16,272
l  push  this  key…

320
00:16:16,272 --> 00:16:17,506
and  that's  it

321
00:16:17,506 --> 00:16:19,667
Cindy vanishes
from  your  life forever

322
00:16:21,744 --> 00:16:24,212
What do you  say    chief?

323
00:16:32,655 --> 00:16:34,555
Terminate  her

324
00:16:35,991 --> 00:16:37,151
Now

325
00:16:48,537 --> 00:16:50,372
Hi.  l'm  home

326
00:16:50,372 --> 00:16:51,862
ln  the  office

327
00:16:54,043 --> 00:16:55,678
Hi

328
00:16:55,678 --> 00:16:57,446
－Tough  day?
-Yeah

329
00:16:57,446 --> 00:16:59,615
Uh    l  won't  bore you
with  the  details

330
00:16:59,615 --> 00:17:01,417
Poor  baby.
l  know  how you  feel

331
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:03,118
l'm  having  trouble
with  my  hard  drive

332
00:17:03,118 --> 00:17:05,387
l  can't access  any of  my files

333
00:17:05,387 --> 00:17:06,722
You  want  me to  check  it out?

334
00:17:06,722 --> 00:17:08,857
Who's the  computer  expert  here?

335
00:17:08,857 --> 00:17:11,160
Well    a  fresh  set of eyes

336
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,593
l'll  open  the  wine

337
00:17:13,796 --> 00:17:15,130
Yeah…

338
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,859
let's  see

339
00:17:19,935 --> 00:17:22,171
“Terminate  her”?

340
00:17:22,171 --> 00:17:25,174
Did  l  actually  hear you  say  
“Terminate  her”?

341
00:17:25,174 --> 00:17:28,143
No!  You  can't  be  here.
We  got  rid  of you

342
00:17:28,143 --> 00:17:30,446
You  tried    but  l  was  hiding…

343
00:17:30,446 --> 00:17:33,115
in  the  computer
in  the  office  next door

344
00:17:33,115 --> 00:17:34,776
Having  any  luck?

345
00:17:35,818 --> 00:17:37,286
Uh－－oh    look…

346
00:17:37,286 --> 00:17:40,022
no    the－-the  damn  thing
it    uh    froze  up  on  me

347
00:17:40,022 --> 00:17:42,124
Why don't we    uh  
pop  some  popcorn?

348
00:17:42,124 --> 00:17:44,927
－We'll  watch  a  movie.
－Wine  and  popcorn?

349
00:17:44,927 --> 00:17:46,762
Yeah    let's  stick  a  bag
in  the  microwave

350
00:17:46,762 --> 00:17:48,297
l'll－－l'll  see  what's  on

351
00:17:48,297 --> 00:17:50,891
Sometimes you  can  be  so  cute

352
00:17:56,705 --> 00:17:59,675
Why are you  trying
to  hurt  me    Ben?

353
00:17:59,675 --> 00:18:02,007
l  love you

354
00:18:03,045 --> 00:18:05,247
l'll－－l'll  get  it

355
00:18:05,247 --> 00:18:06,515
Yeah?

356
00:18:06,515 --> 00:18:09,485
Maybe  it's time  Samantha  and  l
had  a  little talk

357
00:18:09,485 --> 00:18:11,320
No    no    no  
don't－－don't do that

358
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,288
l'll－－l'll－－
l'll  come to the  office

359
00:18:13,288 --> 00:18:14,890
Don't do  anything
on  my account

360
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,959
No    l  want to  come  see you

361
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,660
We'll  talk

362
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,028
And  once
we're  done talking…

363
00:18:20,028 --> 00:18:21,697
l'm  a  tiger    remember?

364
00:18:21,697 --> 00:18:23,132
Grrrr

365
00:18:23,132 --> 00:18:24,967
-You  are  so  cute.
-Yeah－－

366
00:18:24,967 --> 00:18:27,569
－Will  you  stay the  night?
－Uh    uh    stay the  night?

367
00:18:27,569 --> 00:18:30,372
Yeah.  Uh    sure.
Anything  you  want

368
00:18:30,372 --> 00:18:31,840
OK    but  hurry

369
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,137
No－－l'm  already out the  door

370
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,711
Ben?

371
00:18:35,711 --> 00:18:37,312
l  got some－－
the  office  called

372
00:18:37,312 --> 00:18:39,314
There's  a  fire
l  have to  put out

373
00:18:39,314 --> 00:18:40,645
l  gotta  go

374
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,093
Hi

375
00:18:51,093 --> 00:18:52,795
What took you  so  long?

376
00:18:52,795 --> 00:18:55,964
Oh.  What can  l  say?
Traffic  was  horrendous

377
00:18:55,964 --> 00:18:59,134
l  was  gonna  stop
for flowers    but－－

378
00:18:59,134 --> 00:19:00,302
Oh

379
00:19:00,302 --> 00:19:02,770
Uh    well    l  hope  
uh    you  like them

380
00:19:04,273 --> 00:19:05,797
They're  beautiful

381
00:19:22,891 --> 00:19:26,462
What did  you  do to  me?

382
00:19:26,462 --> 00:19:29,031
Uh    well    that's－－
oh    it's－－it's  a  virus

383
00:19:29,031 --> 00:19:31,567
l－－l  stopped  by  
uh    Garrett's

384
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:33,735
He－－he  wrote  it for  me

385
00:19:33,735 --> 00:19:35,437
But why?

386
00:19:35,437 --> 00:19:38,907
l'm  sorry    Cindy  
but  being  with  you…

387
00:19:38,907 --> 00:19:41,535
made  me  realize  how  much
l  really  love  Samantha

388
00:19:42,878 --> 00:19:44,780
That  is  so  romantic

389
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,082
You  are  so  sweet

390
00:19:47,082 --> 00:19:49,744
Yeah    l  guess    but－－oh…

391
00:19:57,226 --> 00:19:58,693
Cindy?

392
00:20:11,106 --> 00:20:12,107
Hello?

393
00:20:12,107 --> 00:20:13,942
Ben    are you  OK?

394
00:20:13,942 --> 00:20:15,611
Yeah    l'm  OK

395
00:20:15,611 --> 00:20:17,246
Did  you  get the fire  put out?

396
00:20:17,246 --> 00:20:20,349
Yeah.  Yeah    it  looks that way

397
00:20:20,349 --> 00:20:21,650
l  know  it's  late…

398
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,285
but could  you  stop  by the  store
on  your  way  home?

399
00:20:23,285 --> 00:20:24,319
Sure

400
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:25,888
l  e－mailed  a  list
of what we  need

401
00:20:25,888 --> 00:20:27,623
The  computer's  working  fine  
by the  way

402
00:20:27,623 --> 00:20:30,158
Uh    great.
So    l'll  see you  soon?

403
00:20:30,158 --> 00:20:31,793
No  need  to  hurry

404
00:20:31,793 --> 00:20:34,796
No  problem.  Sam?

405
00:20:34,796 --> 00:20:36,965
What?

406
00:20:36,965 --> 00:20:38,534
l  love you

407
00:20:38,534 --> 00:20:40,702
Me    too.  Bye

408
00:20:40,702 --> 00:20:42,067
Bye

409
00:20:56,118 --> 00:20:58,887
Sorry  l'm  late.
l  was  dealing  with  my fiancё

410
00:20:58,887 --> 00:21:01,089
He's  been  acting
a  little  strange  lately

411
00:21:01,089 --> 00:21:04,359
lf  l  didn't  know  better  
l'd  swear  he  was  cheating  on  me

412
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:06,662
Hmph.  Men…

413
00:21:06,662 --> 00:21:08,789
You  can't trust them

414
00:21:19,474 --> 00:21:22,044
Benjamin  Baker
narrowly escaped  his fantasy…

415
00:21:22,044 --> 00:21:25,814
while  his fiancёe
explores  her  own  sensual  nature

416
00:21:25,814 --> 00:21:27,716
A  glimpse  into the future
of  modern  romance…
