1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,069
Congratulations    Annie.
lt's  all  yours

2
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:06,969
lt's  hard  to  believe

3
00:00:09,774 --> 00:00:13,344
Scott    that goes
to the  downstairs  bath

4
00:00:13,344 --> 00:00:14,845
l  don't  know  how…

5
00:00:14,845 --> 00:00:16,981
we're  ever  going  to
be  able to  afford  this…

6
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:18,972
but  it  is  perfect

7
00:00:21,852 --> 00:00:23,521
There's  only one thing  missing

8
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:25,182
Get  me the  dolly    will  you?

9
00:00:33,698 --> 00:00:37,301
l  remember that  photo.
Even  Czonka's  smiling

10
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:39,270
You  sent  it out
as  a  Christmas  card  last year

11
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,604
Mm...hmm

12
00:00:40,604 --> 00:00:42,940
lt  belongs  right there  
doesn't  it?

13
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,709
Mm

14
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:46,911
Mom!

15
00:00:46,911 --> 00:00:48,579
Sean  says  l  have  dragon  breath!

16
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:50,948
You  don't  believe  me  
go  ahead  and  sniff  her

17
00:00:50,948 --> 00:00:52,750
l  hate that  photo

18
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,652
That dress  makes  me
look  chunky!

19
00:00:54,652 --> 00:00:57,655
- What dress  doesn't?
- Mom!

20
00:00:57,655 --> 00:01:00,725
So  much  for
my  perfect  moment    huh?

21
00:01:00,725 --> 00:01:03,627
Hey    l  said
no  skateboarding  indoors!

22
00:01:03,627 --> 00:01:07,757
Whoa!  Easy    Czonka    easy!

23
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:11,168
How  'bout  backing  me  up  here?

24
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:14,305
Come  on    honey.
lt's  moving  day

25
00:01:14,305 --> 00:01:16,907
Czonka!  Czonky    bad  boy!

26
00:01:16,907 --> 00:01:19,243
Help…please.
Someone    anyone?

27
00:01:19,243 --> 00:01:21,145
You'll  be fine    Annie

28
00:01:21,145 --> 00:01:23,204
Call  me  if you  need
anything    OK?

29
00:01:24,382 --> 00:01:26,283
- Philip.
- Thank you

30
00:01:26,283 --> 00:01:29,987
Annie    l  just  have to  say
that you  were  right

31
00:01:29,987 --> 00:01:31,682
lt feels
just  like  home  already

32
00:01:32,656 --> 00:01:34,291
Czonka!

33
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:36,657
What?  What?  What?

34
00:01:38,162 --> 00:01:40,698
Oh    boy

35
00:01:40,698 --> 00:01:43,132
Don't tell  me
it's  only  moving  day

36
00:01:47,471 --> 00:01:49,206
Where'd  l  put
those  paper towels?

37
00:01:49,206 --> 00:01:50,639
Honey    relax

38
00:01:52,476 --> 00:01:54,478
Phillip    we've  been  here
fifteen  minutes…

39
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:56,147
and  already
the  hardwood  is  scraped…

40
00:01:56,147 --> 00:01:57,615
and  the fireplace  is  stained

41
00:01:57,615 --> 00:01:59,650
They're  kids    Annie.
The  dog  got excited

42
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:02,987
Phillip    this  is  supposed  to  be
a  fresh  start    a  new  beginning

43
00:02:02,987 --> 00:02:04,722
Just  because
we  have  a  new  house…

44
00:02:04,722 --> 00:02:06,757
doesn't  mean  we're  gonna
turn  into  a  new family

45
00:02:06,757 --> 00:02:08,793
Sometimes  l  wish  we  could

46
00:02:08,793 --> 00:02:10,728
Annie  had  it on  the truck

47
00:02:10,728 --> 00:02:13,330
Does that  make  me
a  terrible  person?

48
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,890
Don't worry.
lt'll  be  our  little  secret

49
00:02:22,373 --> 00:02:24,208
Czonka    you  bad  dog!

50
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,243
Go  give  Mommy some  love

51
00:02:26,243 --> 00:02:29,847
Oh.  Very funny.
Don't tell  me…

52
00:02:29,847 --> 00:02:31,916
Czonka's  already  made
a  new friend

53
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:33,551
What are you  talking  about?

54
00:02:33,551 --> 00:02:34,885
Come  here    Czonk.  Come  here

55
00:02:34,885 --> 00:02:36,687
Good  boy!  Who's  my champ!

56
00:02:36,687 --> 00:02:39,212
That's  right    Czonka  is!

57
00:02:40,357 --> 00:02:41,892
What's  wrong?

58
00:02:41,892 --> 00:02:44,195
Stop  screwing  around    Phillip

59
00:02:44,195 --> 00:02:47,865
l  mean  it.  This  isn't funny.
lf you  bought another  dog…

60
00:02:47,865 --> 00:02:50,267
Do you  know  what Mommy
is talking  about?

61
00:02:50,267 --> 00:02:52,570
Of course you  don't.
Neither  do  l

62
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:55,698
This  is the  wrong  day
for  silly games

63
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:06,517
Perfection

64
00:03:06,517 --> 00:03:08,452
lsn't that something
we  all  yearn  for?

65
00:03:08,452 --> 00:03:10,554
Annie  Macintosh  does

66
00:03:10,554 --> 00:03:12,590
She  wants the  perfect  house  
the  perfect family…

67
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,191
the  perfect  life…

68
00:03:14,191 --> 00:03:18,629
but she's  about to  learn  that
perfection  is  an  illusion…

69
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:20,965
and  a  terrifying  one
at that…

70
00:03:20,965 --> 00:03:23,490
in  The  Twilight Zone

71
00:03:27,004 --> 00:03:30,741
You're traveling
to  another  dimension...

72
00:03:30,741 --> 00:03:34,645
a  dimension  not only
of sight and  sound…

73
00:03:34,645 --> 00:03:36,442
but of  mind

74
00:03:37,915 --> 00:03:41,018
A journey
into  a  wondrous  land…

75
00:03:41,018 --> 00:03:44,920
whose  boundaries  are  only that
of the  imagination

76
00:03:48,092 --> 00:03:49,753
You're  entering…

77
00:04:00,004 --> 00:04:02,306
Satisfied?

78
00:04:02,306 --> 00:04:04,108
l  don't  understand

79
00:04:04,108 --> 00:04:05,643
What  happened  to  Czonka?

80
00:04:05,643 --> 00:04:07,645
l  really wish
you'd  stop  saying  that

81
00:04:07,645 --> 00:04:09,647
You're  gonna  give  him
a  complex

82
00:04:09,647 --> 00:04:11,682
That  is  not  my dog

83
00:04:11,682 --> 00:04:13,851
Well    l  don't  know
what to tell  you

84
00:04:13,851 --> 00:04:15,486
Look  at  his  AKC  papers

85
00:04:15,486 --> 00:04:18,556
Look  at  his  ribbons  
his  champion  certificate

86
00:04:18,556 --> 00:04:21,492
- How  much  proof do you  need?
- lt's  not  my dog!

87
00:04:21,492 --> 00:04:22,760
Annie    you  love this  dog!

88
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,995
Hell    there  are  days you  think
you  like  him  better than  me

89
00:04:24,995 --> 00:04:28,032
Why are you  pretending
you  don't  recognize  him?

90
00:04:28,032 --> 00:04:31,468
Go  away.  Phillip    get  him  away

91
00:04:31,468 --> 00:04:33,231
Czonka    sit

92
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,142
Sean  is  stapling
his  posters to the  wall

93
00:04:38,142 --> 00:04:40,010
You're  a  traitor  
you  know that?

94
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,279
- And  they shoot traitors.
- Leave  me  alone!

95
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:44,338
- ls that a  new  zit?
- l  hate you!

96
00:04:45,482 --> 00:04:47,643
That's  not  my dog

97
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,025
Annie    listen  to  me
very carefully

98
00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:56,360
l've  seen  this  before…

99
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,729
and  buying  your first  home
can  be  very difficult

100
00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:01,165
There's  escrow    inspections…

101
00:05:01,165 --> 00:05:03,000
it's  a  lot of stress

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,069
So  what you're  saying  is
l've  owned  a  poodle…

103
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:08,405
for five years…
and  never  realized  it

104
00:05:08,405 --> 00:05:11,575
l've  had  clients
forget their  own  names…

105
00:05:11,575 --> 00:05:14,378
the year  it was  
how  many children  they  had

106
00:05:14,378 --> 00:05:17,581
l  knew this  one  guy who  
every day for three  months…

107
00:05:17,581 --> 00:05:20,484
drove  back to  his
old  apartment after  work

108
00:05:20,484 --> 00:05:22,052
What's that got to  do  with  me?

109
00:05:22,052 --> 00:05:25,222
l've  got two teenagers.
l  eat stress for  breakfast

110
00:05:25,222 --> 00:05:27,091
Which  is  why
l'm  not worried  about you

111
00:05:27,091 --> 00:05:29,559
Then  stop  looking  so  worried

112
00:05:31,595 --> 00:05:34,431
l  just want you  to  remember
we  ran  the  numbers

113
00:05:34,431 --> 00:05:36,467
You  are  not  in  over your  head

114
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:39,003
You  got a  great deal  here

115
00:05:39,003 --> 00:05:42,306
Told  you  buying  a  model  home
was the  way to  go

116
00:05:42,306 --> 00:05:44,942
What are you  really
trying  to  say    Yasmine?

117
00:05:44,942 --> 00:05:47,344
l'm  saying…relax

118
00:05:47,344 --> 00:05:49,413
Everything  is  gonna  be  OK

119
00:05:49,413 --> 00:05:51,382
This  is your  home

120
00:05:51,382 --> 00:05:53,417
And  that…

121
00:05:53,417 --> 00:05:55,408
is your  dog

122
00:06:03,193 --> 00:06:05,029
What's that?

123
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:06,758
French  champagne

124
00:06:08,732 --> 00:06:12,069
Talk  about optimistic

125
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:14,697
l'm  so  sorry  it's  been
such  a  tough  day

126
00:06:16,373 --> 00:06:18,742
l'm  sorry
if  l  freaked  you  out

127
00:06:18,742 --> 00:06:22,200
Does that  mean  l  can
open  up the  champagne?

128
00:06:23,547 --> 00:06:25,447
Down    boy!

129
00:06:30,087 --> 00:06:33,257
Annie    l  just want to  say…

130
00:06:33,257 --> 00:06:36,493
l  know that
l  was  reluctant to  move…

131
00:06:36,493 --> 00:06:39,596
but  l  am  so  glad
that you  talked  me  into  it

132
00:06:39,596 --> 00:06:44,056
Now    if  l  could
talk  you  into  something…

133
00:06:53,444 --> 00:06:55,469
Just  pretend  he's  not there

134
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,650
l  can't

84
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:42,000

135
00:07:44,762 --> 00:07:46,463
- Mom.
- Hmm?

136
00:07:46,463 --> 00:07:48,966
You  forgot to  buy syrup.
You  know  l  hate  plain  waffles

137
00:07:48,966 --> 00:07:50,801
l'll  go  shopping  today

138
00:07:50,801 --> 00:07:53,370
Tess    l  made you
a  special  surprise for  lunch

139
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:57,534
- lt  better  be  egg  salad.
- How'd  you  guess?

140
00:08:00,244 --> 00:08:01,645
Morning

141
00:08:01,645 --> 00:08:02,805
Love you

142
00:08:05,048 --> 00:08:07,084
Who...who  was that?

143
00:08:07,084 --> 00:08:09,018
Mom    cut  it out

144
00:08:10,154 --> 00:08:11,889
Tess…l  asked  you  a  question

145
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:14,057
Who  is that  boy    and  what's
he  doing  in  our  house?

146
00:08:14,057 --> 00:08:15,159
Mom    come  on

147
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:17,194
First  it was  Czonka  
and  now  it's  Sean?

148
00:08:17,194 --> 00:08:20,230
Sean?  Wh...what are you
talking  about?

149
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,498
That  isn't  Sean

150
00:08:21,498 --> 00:08:25,366
Dad!  Mom's  acting  weird  again!

151
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,674
Sean!

152
00:08:30,674 --> 00:08:32,904
Get down  here  right  n...

153
00:08:41,785 --> 00:08:44,879
Mom?  What's  wrong?

154
00:08:50,961 --> 00:08:52,796
Phillip!

155
00:08:52,796 --> 00:08:56,099
Phillip!

156
00:08:56,099 --> 00:08:57,968
Phillip!

157
00:08:57,968 --> 00:08:59,833
Aah!

158
00:09:02,573 --> 00:09:04,768
Mom!

159
00:09:07,077 --> 00:09:08,745
You'll  be just fine

160
00:09:08,745 --> 00:09:10,337
Just get some  rest

161
00:09:13,217 --> 00:09:14,351
We're  good  here

162
00:09:14,351 --> 00:09:15,909
She's  gonna  be fine

163
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,159
Annie?

164
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,894
You  gave  us  quite  a  scare

165
00:09:23,894 --> 00:09:26,196
What  happened?

166
00:09:26,196 --> 00:09:28,499
You  took  a  little tumble  
but you're  gonna  be  OK

167
00:09:28,499 --> 00:09:31,301
The  paramedics  said  you  might
have  a  slight concussion

168
00:09:31,301 --> 00:09:32,632
Ohh…

169
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,109
Sean…Tess…
where  are they?

170
00:09:39,109 --> 00:09:41,478
Kids    your  mom
wants to  see you

171
00:09:41,478 --> 00:09:43,013
No

172
00:09:43,013 --> 00:09:44,681
No

173
00:09:44,681 --> 00:09:46,546
Those  are  not our  children

174
00:09:48,418 --> 00:09:51,822
Time for  school    you  two.
You're  late  enough  already

175
00:09:51,822 --> 00:09:54,925
Come  on.  Bye    Dad

176
00:09:54,925 --> 00:09:56,693
Bye    Mom

177
00:09:56,693 --> 00:09:58,422
See ya  later

178
00:10:05,102 --> 00:10:06,336
Sean  and  Tess…

179
00:10:06,336 --> 00:10:07,838
Annie    sit    sit

180
00:10:07,838 --> 00:10:10,107
Phillip!  Don't you  care?

181
00:10:10,107 --> 00:10:11,808
Our  children  are  missing!

182
00:10:11,808 --> 00:10:13,043
Listen  to  me    Annie

183
00:10:13,043 --> 00:10:15,279
Our  kids  are
on  their  way to  school

184
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,414
l've  never  seen  those two
before  in  my  life

185
00:10:17,414 --> 00:10:19,049
Don't you  know
your  own  children?

186
00:10:19,049 --> 00:10:21,051
Of course  l  do!
You're  confused

187
00:10:21,051 --> 00:10:23,554
No    l'm  not!
You're the  one that's  confused!

188
00:10:23,554 --> 00:10:26,056
What's  wrong  with  you?
What's  wrong  with  everybody?

189
00:10:26,056 --> 00:10:27,991
Annie    calm  down!

190
00:10:27,991 --> 00:10:30,327
Oh    God!
What  if  it  happens to you?

191
00:10:30,327 --> 00:10:33,864
- What  if you  vanish  next?
- l'm  not going  anywhere

192
00:10:33,864 --> 00:10:36,458
How  can  l  be  sure?
l  don't want to  lose you!

193
00:10:38,602 --> 00:10:41,127
You're  not going  to

194
00:10:50,247 --> 00:10:51,339
Ohh…

195
00:10:54,318 --> 00:10:55,876
No…

196
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,355
No

197
00:10:58,355 --> 00:11:00,924
Annie…what's  wrong?

198
00:11:00,924 --> 00:11:03,794
Oh    no    no    no

199
00:11:03,794 --> 00:11:04,988
No…

200
00:11:21,545 --> 00:11:23,046
Phillip...

201
00:11:23,046 --> 00:11:25,415
or  whoever you  are...
just go  away!

202
00:11:25,415 --> 00:11:27,084
Annie    it's  me

203
00:11:27,084 --> 00:11:28,915
Yasmine

204
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,814
Yasmine

205
00:11:36,593 --> 00:11:39,061
ls that  really you?

206
00:11:45,268 --> 00:11:47,771
At  least you  haven't changed

207
00:11:47,771 --> 00:11:49,406
Did  you  see  him?
Did  you  see  Phillip?

208
00:11:49,406 --> 00:11:50,607
He  called  me

209
00:11:50,607 --> 00:11:51,875
He  asked  me to  come
speak  with  you

210
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,377
But did  you  see  him?

211
00:11:53,377 --> 00:11:54,978
Annie    he's  downstairs

212
00:11:54,978 --> 00:11:56,413
And…

213
00:11:56,413 --> 00:11:59,082
And  he's  very concerned
about you

214
00:11:59,082 --> 00:12:02,986
And  you  didn't  notice
anything  different about  him?

215
00:12:02,986 --> 00:12:05,889
Annie    l  know this  is  hard
for you  to  believe…

216
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:08,759
but…Phillip
is  still  Phillip…

217
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:11,294
just  like  Czonka's
still  Czonka…

218
00:12:11,294 --> 00:12:13,563
the  kids  are  still  the  kids.
None  of them  have  changed

219
00:12:13,563 --> 00:12:14,655
Oh…

220
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:19,569
- l  am  not going  crazy.
- No  one  says you  are

221
00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:22,339
l'm  sure there's  a  perfectly
rational  explanation

222
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:25,375
Yeah    you're  right.  There  is

223
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,275
l  changed  them

224
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:29,780
You  lost  me

225
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:33,550
l  remember telling
Phillip  l…

226
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:37,254
l  wished  for the  perfect family
to  go  with  all  of this

227
00:12:37,254 --> 00:12:38,855
And?

228
00:12:38,855 --> 00:12:40,524
My wish…

229
00:12:40,524 --> 00:12:42,424
it's  come true

230
00:12:43,527 --> 00:12:44,928
Heh

231
00:12:44,928 --> 00:12:46,630
Yasmine    this  is  not funny!

232
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,224
l'm  sorry.  lt's just…

233
00:12:51,201 --> 00:12:53,437
You  trust  me    Annie?

234
00:12:53,437 --> 00:12:55,205
l  want to

235
00:12:55,205 --> 00:12:56,473
Then  come  downstairs  with  me

236
00:12:56,473 --> 00:12:57,674
Why?

237
00:12:57,674 --> 00:13:00,177
l  want to  show you  something

238
00:13:00,177 --> 00:13:01,678
Look  at  me    Annie

239
00:13:01,678 --> 00:13:02,846
l'm  still  Yasmine    right?

240
00:13:02,846 --> 00:13:06,049
l  haven't changed

241
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:08,449
Come  downstairs

242
00:13:44,988 --> 00:13:47,354
This  isn't  my furniture

243
00:13:49,326 --> 00:13:51,385
Our  sofa  was ten  years  old

244
00:13:54,998 --> 00:13:56,933
The  stereo

245
00:13:56,933 --> 00:13:59,102
Phillip  wanted  this  stereo  
but  it was  $10000...

246
00:13:59,102 --> 00:14:03,473
OK    OK.  Let's just  pretend
for  a  second…

247
00:14:03,473 --> 00:14:05,942
that everything
you've told  me  is true…

248
00:14:05,942 --> 00:14:08,345
that...that this  isn't
your furniture…

249
00:14:08,345 --> 00:14:10,347
and  this  isn't your family…

250
00:14:10,347 --> 00:14:13,450
and  somehow
everything's  changed

251
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:15,352
Oh    Annie    don't you  get  it?

252
00:14:15,352 --> 00:14:18,789
Don't you  see?
Any way you  look  at  it…

253
00:14:18,789 --> 00:14:21,091
you  got what you  wanted

254
00:14:21,091 --> 00:14:23,150
Honey    you've traded  up

255
00:14:44,147 --> 00:14:47,717
So…how's the  new  school?

256
00:14:47,717 --> 00:14:50,053
The  campus  looks  very  nice

257
00:14:50,053 --> 00:14:51,721
l  love the tennis  courts

258
00:14:51,721 --> 00:14:53,557
They  have  stadium  seating
and  everything

259
00:14:53,557 --> 00:14:55,158
l  met  my  new  swim  coach  today

260
00:14:55,158 --> 00:14:57,661
He  won  a  bronze  medal
at the  '88  Olympics

261
00:14:57,661 --> 00:15:02,257
Well    it seems  like you  two  are
really going  to  love  it  here

262
00:15:11,174 --> 00:15:12,509
How's  work    Dad?

263
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:17,113
Well    you  know that  biotech
company that  l  made  an  offer  on?

264
00:15:17,113 --> 00:15:18,915
We  closed  the  deal  today

265
00:15:18,915 --> 00:15:20,016
Cool!

266
00:15:20,016 --> 00:15:21,484
That's  great!

267
00:15:21,484 --> 00:15:22,951
lsn't that great    Mom?

268
00:15:28,191 --> 00:15:29,492
Yes

269
00:15:29,492 --> 00:15:31,255
lt's...it's  great

270
00:15:34,931 --> 00:15:38,668
So    Mom    um  
is your  head  feeling  any  better?

271
00:15:38,668 --> 00:15:41,605
Hey    you  remember that time that
l  got  beaned  in  little  league?

272
00:15:41,605 --> 00:15:43,630
You  played  little  league?

273
00:15:50,046 --> 00:15:52,276
l  guess  l  forgot

274
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,515
l  think  l'll  get
some  more  wine

275
00:16:15,672 --> 00:16:17,107
OK

276
00:16:17,107 --> 00:16:18,775
This  is  what you  wanted…

277
00:16:18,775 --> 00:16:22,541
the  perfect family  
the  perfect  home…

278
00:16:30,153 --> 00:16:33,089
To the  best  mom
in  the  world

279
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:36,660
We  love you
more than  you'll  ever  know

280
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,992
“Tess  and  Sean.”

281
00:16:45,035 --> 00:16:47,060
And  you  love  me    too    right?

282
00:16:50,707 --> 00:16:52,197
You're  a  good  dog

283
00:17:03,186 --> 00:17:05,313
This  is your family  now

284
00:17:07,223 --> 00:17:09,282
They  love you.
They  need  you

285
00:17:14,164 --> 00:17:17,327
You're  gonna  have to try
to  make this  work

286
00:17:34,884 --> 00:17:36,886
She's  not getting
any  better    Dad

287
00:17:36,886 --> 00:17:39,055
lf anything  
she's  getting  worse

288
00:17:39,055 --> 00:17:40,857
l  know

289
00:17:40,857 --> 00:17:42,492
What are  we  gonna  do?

290
00:17:42,492 --> 00:17:43,925
We  have to  help  her

291
00:17:45,829 --> 00:17:48,965
We're  gonna  do  whatever  it takes
to  make  her  better

292
00:17:48,965 --> 00:17:51,201
l've  already  made  some  calls

293
00:17:51,201 --> 00:17:54,037
Will  she  have to  go  away?

294
00:17:54,037 --> 00:17:56,072
Just for  a  little  while

295
00:17:56,072 --> 00:17:58,131
Don't worry.  l'll  be  here

296
00:18:02,012 --> 00:18:04,105
Honey    is that you?

297
00:18:09,619 --> 00:18:11,521
This  is Yasmine.
Please  leave your  name…

298
00:18:11,521 --> 00:18:13,823
number    and  a  brief  message.
Have  a  great day

299
00:18:13,823 --> 00:18:16,159
Yasmine    if you're there  
pick  up!

300
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:18,661
Yasmine    please!
l  don't  know  what to  do

301
00:18:18,661 --> 00:18:20,263
They're  gonna  send  me  away

302
00:18:20,263 --> 00:18:21,798
Annie    where  are you?

303
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:24,062
Oh    God    they're  coming

304
00:18:26,636 --> 00:18:27,864
Mom?

305
00:18:37,714 --> 00:18:39,079
Where  are you?

306
00:18:51,561 --> 00:18:52,892
Annie

307
00:18:55,098 --> 00:18:56,599
What are you  doing?

308
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:57,861
No!

309
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:02,194
You  leave  me  al...alone

310
00:19:14,684 --> 00:19:17,551
Help  me    please!

311
00:19:21,257 --> 00:19:22,986
Ohh…

312
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,364
No…

313
00:19:28,364 --> 00:19:30,229
No!

314
00:19:42,712 --> 00:19:44,581
There you  are

315
00:19:44,581 --> 00:19:46,716
Are you  OK    Annie?

316
00:19:46,716 --> 00:19:48,718
l  was just  looking
at our  picture…

317
00:19:48,718 --> 00:19:50,753
thinking  how  lucky  l  am

318
00:19:50,753 --> 00:19:53,957
l  have  a  wonderful  family…

319
00:19:53,957 --> 00:19:56,292
a  beautiful  new  home

320
00:19:56,292 --> 00:19:57,760
lt's  perfect

321
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,524
Just  like you

322
00:20:11,608 --> 00:20:13,977
Lizzie.  Dinner

323
00:20:13,977 --> 00:20:16,446
l'll  be  right there

324
00:20:16,446 --> 00:20:19,609
l  just finished  upgrading
my digital  family game

325
00:20:27,323 --> 00:20:29,859
Just a  game?  Or  is  it?

326
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:32,028
How  do  we  know  we  aren't all
just characters…

327
00:20:32,028 --> 00:20:34,731
in  some  computer  game
called  life?

328
00:20:34,731 --> 00:20:37,000
And  at any  moment  
each  of  us  could  be  replaced…

329
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,435
by someone
a  little  smarter…

330
00:20:39,435 --> 00:20:40,803
a  little younger…

331
00:20:40,803 --> 00:20:43,966
a  little  more…
perfect?
