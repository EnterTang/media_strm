0
00:01:52,562 --> 00:01:54,587
when?

1
00:01:54,664 --> 00:01:55,995
Today.

2
00:02:00,503 --> 00:02:02,994
Get me Eric Rayburn, NSA.

3
00:02:11,781 --> 00:02:15,114
l wish Nicole could have come.
She loves it out here.

4
00:02:17,987 --> 00:02:20,455
what do you wanna do tonight?

5
00:02:20,523 --> 00:02:23,117
l don't know. Get a movie?

6
00:02:23,193 --> 00:02:26,321
You came all this way to watch a video?

7
00:02:34,437 --> 00:02:36,667
How's your mom?

8
00:02:36,773 --> 00:02:38,468
who knows?

9
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:45,003
She puts on a happy face for everyone,
but l know she's hurtin'.

10
00:02:48,852 --> 00:02:51,446
OK. Copy that.

11
00:02:51,521 --> 00:02:55,719
- what is it, Rosser?
- There's a situation, Mr President.

12
00:03:06,536 --> 00:03:08,970
OK, try and find me.

13
00:03:09,038 --> 00:03:11,506
Excuse me. what are you doing in my bed?

14
00:03:11,574 --> 00:03:13,667
Sh. l'm hiding from Daddy.

15
00:03:13,743 --> 00:03:15,142
what?

16
00:03:15,211 --> 00:03:17,736
- Oh, hi.
- Hey, Kim.

17
00:03:18,815 --> 00:03:22,512
You haven't seen Megan around, have you?

18
00:03:22,585 --> 00:03:25,748
- what does she look like?
- Big wart on the tip of her nose.

19
00:03:25,855 --> 00:03:28,255
- l do not!
- There you are.

20
00:03:28,358 --> 00:03:30,758
Now l'm gonna get you.

21
00:03:32,996 --> 00:03:35,487
- Let me go!
- l'm gonna get you now.

22
00:03:35,565 --> 00:03:38,398
l'm going to hide again.

23
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,736
How do you keep up with her all day?

24
00:03:47,844 --> 00:03:49,436
lt's not easy.

25
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,021
Dad, l'm hiding! Try to find me!

26
00:04:04,093 --> 00:04:06,186
Here l come!

27
00:04:18,107 --> 00:04:20,701
Rayburn is waiting for us.

28
00:04:20,777 --> 00:04:23,143
l'll see you back at the retreat.

29
00:04:23,246 --> 00:04:25,942
Look, son...

30
00:04:26,049 --> 00:04:28,882
- l'm sorry.
- Don't be. lt's not your fault.

31
00:04:28,952 --> 00:04:31,887
- l just miss hanging out with you.
- l know.

32
00:04:31,955 --> 00:04:34,253
we'll get there.

33
00:04:34,324 --> 00:04:36,451
- See you later.
- All right.

34
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:39,153
l know you wanna spend time with him.
l'm sorry, sir.

35
00:04:39,262 --> 00:04:43,062
- How bad is the situation?
- l don't know, but l don't have a good feeling.

36
00:04:43,132 --> 00:04:47,432
To my knowledge, no president's
been rerouted by NSA on a morning off.

37
00:04:47,503 --> 00:04:49,596
Thank you.

38
00:04:59,315 --> 00:05:02,284
l didn't know how you liked
intel presented at impromptus,

39
00:05:02,352 --> 00:05:05,446
if you like it chronologically
with an alphabetical key,

40
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:09,287
or if you just like
separate folders with access tabs.

41
00:05:10,293 --> 00:05:14,696
- l don't really care.
- l did it both ways, so you can choose.

42
00:05:15,832 --> 00:05:17,595
Thanks, Paula. George.

43
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:20,999
- Hi, Mr Mason.
- Yeah?

44
00:05:21,104 --> 00:05:24,631
l ordered upgrades on all the SlM software.
l hope you don't mind.

45
00:05:24,707 --> 00:05:27,471
They just went to production
and l thought you'd...

46
00:05:27,543 --> 00:05:29,704
Paula, stop.

47
00:05:29,812 --> 00:05:31,780
Right. OK. Thanks.

48
00:05:32,715 --> 00:05:34,114
what do you need?

49
00:05:34,183 --> 00:05:37,710
- Division want a meeting next month.
- For what?

50
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,223
They wanna see our proposal
for the LAX security upgrades.

51
00:05:42,325 --> 00:05:46,887
Tony, if l'm still here this time next year,
take me out to the woodshed and shoot me.

52
00:05:46,996 --> 00:05:51,729
l should be in DC, not chasing old ladies who
set off metal detectors with knitting needles.

53
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:53,392
The morning of the 15th?

54
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,532
That's fine.

55
00:05:54,637 --> 00:05:57,299
- Mr Mason.
- what?

56
00:05:57,373 --> 00:06:00,740
l just got off the phone
with Eric Rayburn's office at NSA.

57
00:06:00,843 --> 00:06:05,212
They've a request, sir.
They want you to take care of it right away.

58
00:06:08,051 --> 00:06:10,849
This can't be right. Eileen, get me Rayburn.

59
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:15,584
l think he's up in Oregon with the president.
Put it in my office.

60
00:06:20,997 --> 00:06:23,056
what was that about?

61
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:26,101
NSA wants us to bring in Jack Bauer.

62
00:06:26,202 --> 00:06:28,568
what? what for?

63
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:32,835
l don't know. That's all they said.
lsn't Bauer inactive?

64
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:35,935
Yeah, he's inactive.

65
00:07:42,078 --> 00:07:44,672
we'll have to reschedule our day.
what do we have?

66
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,147
National wildlife benefit at one,
a tour of the new Nike Campus,

67
00:07:48,251 --> 00:07:50,481
and your speech tonight.

68
00:07:50,586 --> 00:07:52,850
OK. Cancel what you have to,

69
00:07:52,955 --> 00:07:56,652
but l wanna give that speech,
announce the new clean-energy proposal.

70
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:00,456
- l'm not sure you'll have time for any of that.
- Eric.

71
00:08:02,198 --> 00:08:04,189
- l'll take care of it.
- Thanks, Jenny.

72
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:09,033
- what's this about, Eric?
- we have a domestic terrorist alert.

73
00:08:09,138 --> 00:08:11,698
- How serious?
- Very.

74
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:16,169
- Has Lynne been informed?
- She's here.

75
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,678
who else?

76
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:23,047
Representatives from all branches
of the military, some FBl and the ClA.

77
00:08:26,355 --> 00:08:30,621
Mr President, l've called Mike Novick.
He's getting on a plane right away.

78
00:08:30,693 --> 00:08:32,627
Good. Thank you.

79
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:47,643
- Gentlemen. Lynne.
- Morning, Mr President.

80
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:51,703
what l'm about to tell you,
Mr President, is triple-sourced.

81
00:08:51,814 --> 00:08:57,719
while crucial details are still unknown,
we believe this intel to have high credibility.

82
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,481
Go on.

83
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:04,185
There's a nuclear device,
under terrorist control, that's on US soil.

84
00:09:06,195 --> 00:09:07,753
My God!

85
00:09:08,764 --> 00:09:10,823
- where?
- Los Angeles.

86
00:09:11,867 --> 00:09:16,031
lt gets worse.
This bomb is going to go off today.

87
00:09:19,275 --> 00:09:21,368
How do we know this?

88
00:09:23,613 --> 00:09:26,446
This suicide bomber is
Mamud Rashed Faheen,

89
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:33,045
a suspected terrorist who we believe has
been associated with fundamentalist groups.

90
00:09:33,122 --> 00:09:36,023
This is the Valentine's Day bombing
in the west Bank?

91
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:41,860
This particular attack
resulted in 13 fatalities, 26 injured.

92
00:09:41,931 --> 00:09:44,923
we discovered that
the secondary purpose of this incident

93
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:48,595
was to create the impression
Faheen was killed.

94
00:09:48,704 --> 00:09:51,298
- He wasn't?
- No.

95
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:56,104
This was taken five days ago
at a small airport outside Leon, France.

96
00:09:56,212 --> 00:09:59,545
we had the man on the left,
Jason Park, under surveillance.

97
00:09:59,615 --> 00:10:05,110
lt was just a coincidence that we caught
the very much alive Faheen in the photo.

98
00:10:05,221 --> 00:10:08,713
we grabbed Park and tried to extract
everything we could out of him.

99
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:12,283
15 minutes ago he broke
and confessed that for the last two years

100
00:10:12,395 --> 00:10:15,728
Faheen has been preparing for
today's attack on Los Angeles.

101
00:10:15,798 --> 00:10:17,789
why didn't you pick up Faheen?

102
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,631
This picture wasn't analyzed
until after the two had separated.

103
00:10:21,737 --> 00:10:26,299
l've contacted Defense, ClA,
FBl and local jurisdictions.

104
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:30,436
- Everything will be run through NSA.
- who controls Faheen?

105
00:10:30,513 --> 00:10:34,449
Relatively new splinter group
that goes by the name of Second wave.

106
00:10:34,517 --> 00:10:35,677
Government affiliation?

107
00:10:35,785 --> 00:10:39,084
Officially not recognized
by any Middle Eastern state.

108
00:10:39,155 --> 00:10:41,248
Unofficially?

109
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,805
- Get me their prime minister.
- Right away.

110
00:11:25,134 --> 00:11:28,001
Gary, your breakfast is ready.
Don't let it get cold.

111
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:30,163
l'll be right there.

112
00:11:35,344 --> 00:11:39,644
l won't be back till this afternoon. l'm
expecting a package. Keep an eye out for it?

113
00:11:39,715 --> 00:11:41,808
Sure.

114
00:11:43,018 --> 00:11:46,317
- Mom, l'm going skateboarding.
- And what does that mean?

115
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:50,018
l know - l have to put on my helmet
and my elbow and knee pads.

116
00:11:50,092 --> 00:11:52,185
And stay close to Kim.

117
00:11:53,062 --> 00:11:54,859
- Love you.
- what about Kim?

118
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,330
She's the best nanny ever.

119
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,197
- You off?
- Yeah.

120
00:11:59,268 --> 00:12:02,829
Coffee's ready, l cut your grapefruit
and l bought some scones.

121
00:12:02,905 --> 00:12:05,396
- Blueberry?
- Of course.

122
00:12:20,122 --> 00:12:22,215
- You look good today.
- Thanks.

123
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,384
- l'll see you tonight, OK?
- OK.

124
00:12:35,971 --> 00:12:39,099
You know, Kim, you've got a great body.

125
00:12:41,076 --> 00:12:43,135
You work out?

126
00:12:43,245 --> 00:12:45,736
Not really. l like to swim.

127
00:12:55,558 --> 00:12:58,118
l have the prime minister
on the phone for you.

128
00:12:58,227 --> 00:13:00,821
- Mr Prime Minister.
- Mr President.

129
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,728
l was told you need to speak to me.

130
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:08,168
what can you tell me about a terrorist
organization known as Second wave?

131
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:13,503
l've heard of them, but my government
firmly rejects its tenets and its methods.

132
00:13:13,609 --> 00:13:17,841
ln fact, we've recently arrested
several of its members.

133
00:13:17,947 --> 00:13:23,783
How do you account for three Second wave
camps operating unimpeded in your country?

134
00:13:23,853 --> 00:13:26,481
There are no camps in my country.

135
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:29,581
Mr Prime Minister, l know two things.

136
00:13:29,658 --> 00:13:34,527
One: Second wave is planning
an attack against one of my cities today.

137
00:13:35,764 --> 00:13:39,165
Two: your government
supports Second wave.

138
00:13:39,268 --> 00:13:44,171
l would appreciate it if you would stop
using my people and my country

139
00:13:44,273 --> 00:13:47,504
as a source for every threat
leveled at the United States.

140
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:52,377
what l'm saying is not meant to be a threat,
simply a statement of fact.

141
00:13:53,315 --> 00:13:57,615
lf a bomb goes off on US soil today,

142
00:13:57,686 --> 00:14:01,144
l will have no choice but to retaliate,

143
00:14:01,223 --> 00:14:04,488
with immediate and decisive force,
against your government.

144
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,290
This is an insult.

145
00:14:07,363 --> 00:14:10,992
we are not planning
to attack the United States.

146
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:13,125
lnsult or not,

147
00:14:13,202 --> 00:14:18,640
if you care about the lives of your citizens,
you need to hear me loud and clear.

148
00:14:19,475 --> 00:14:26,244
Mr Prime Minister,
if a bomb goes off today, it will hurt us,

149
00:14:26,348 --> 00:14:28,839
but it will destroy you.

150
00:14:31,487 --> 00:14:34,217
Then, Mr President,

151
00:14:34,323 --> 00:14:39,317
you will have created an enemy
of over one third of the world's population.

152
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,898
Proceed carefully.

153
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:46,058
You as well, sir.

154
00:14:58,681 --> 00:15:00,740
- You wanna try it again?
- Yeah.

155
00:15:02,217 --> 00:15:04,777
Don't fall. You can do it, though.

156
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:06,946
All right. Slow...

157
00:15:35,951 --> 00:15:38,112
- Yeah.
- Mr Bauer?

158
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,950
- who is this?
- l have George Mason from CTU on the line.

159
00:15:41,056 --> 00:15:43,650
- l don't work for CTU anymore.
- He said that...

160
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,286
l'm in the middle of something right now.
Thank you.

161
00:15:59,975 --> 00:16:02,466
l'm so proud of you. You did so good.

162
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:06,514
- ls there any blood?
- Let me see.

163
00:16:06,615 --> 00:16:09,482
No, no blood. You're perfect.

164
00:16:10,953 --> 00:16:13,012
OK. l wanna go again.

165
00:16:13,122 --> 00:16:17,320
- All right. Let's go, tough guy.
- Hey! l'm not a guy.

166
00:16:27,202 --> 00:16:31,366
You know what? why don't you go play
in the back yard. l'll meet you there.

167
00:16:31,473 --> 00:16:33,532
See you in a bit.

168
00:16:35,377 --> 00:16:37,641
Hey, sweetheart.

169
00:16:37,713 --> 00:16:41,308
- Dad, what are you doing here?
- l just wanted to say hi.

170
00:16:41,383 --> 00:16:43,783
You haven't been returning my calls.

171
00:16:43,852 --> 00:16:45,945
l'm sorry.

172
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,290
l didn't come to ask you
for lunch or hang out.

173
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:55,353
l know you just started this job,
but l just wanted to see you. l miss you.

174
00:16:57,366 --> 00:17:01,632
l know. l miss you too.

175
00:17:02,805 --> 00:17:06,002
- Then why won't you...
- Every time l see you, l think of Mom.

176
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:08,009
- No, honey, please...
- Yes, l do.

177
00:17:08,077 --> 00:17:12,844
lf you wanna know, l'm telling you,
it's too hard for me right now.

178
00:17:12,915 --> 00:17:15,884
All l ever wanted was
the three of us to be together.

179
00:17:15,984 --> 00:17:19,681
- lt wasn't your fault. ltjust happened.
- Of course it was my fault.

180
00:17:19,755 --> 00:17:20,983
Dad.

181
00:17:21,757 --> 00:17:24,487
l'm so sorry, honey. l'm so sorry.

182
00:17:27,096 --> 00:17:29,189
l love you.

183
00:17:29,865 --> 00:17:33,198
l'm just still not ready yet.

184
00:17:37,906 --> 00:17:40,898
- Then when?
- l don't know.

185
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:44,342
Hey, Kim. Come on.

186
00:17:45,914 --> 00:17:48,007
- l gotta go.
- Yeah.

187
00:18:26,455 --> 00:18:30,482
- Come in, Eric.
- Mr President, you wanted to see me.

188
00:18:30,592 --> 00:18:34,494
Yes. This report seems to be
missing a casualty assessment.

189
00:18:34,596 --> 00:18:39,898
l'm having those figures compiled right now.
They'll be ready in about 10 minutes.

190
00:18:39,968 --> 00:18:43,301
- Thank you, Eric.
- Mr President, if l may...

191
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:47,934
l think you need to have a serious
conversation with the Pentagon.

192
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:50,604
They need to know how to proceed.

193
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:53,944
lt's too early to discuss a response.

194
00:18:54,016 --> 00:18:56,951
we don't even know who to retaliate against.

195
00:18:57,019 --> 00:19:01,820
- You know the prime minister was lying.
- He was lying about the terrorist camps.

196
00:19:01,924 --> 00:19:05,587
But that doesn't mean his government
is responsible for this threat.

197
00:19:05,661 --> 00:19:08,425
- Mr President, l think...
- Eric, enough.

198
00:19:09,198 --> 00:19:13,259
Right now, my only concern
is protecting Americans.

199
00:19:13,335 --> 00:19:17,863
Somewhere in Los Angeles, there is
a terrorist with his finger on the trigger.

200
00:19:17,973 --> 00:19:19,099
we've got to get him.

201
00:19:54,343 --> 00:19:57,312
- Good morning.
- Hi, sweetheart.

202
00:19:59,081 --> 00:20:01,641
Hey, you two! Cut it out.

203
00:20:01,717 --> 00:20:04,515
what? l can't kiss my own wife?

204
00:20:04,586 --> 00:20:08,818
She's not your wife
for at least another 10 hours.

205
00:20:08,891 --> 00:20:12,019
- Andre is on the phone.
- ls there a problem with the flowers?

206
00:20:12,094 --> 00:20:14,187
- l don't know.
- God!

207
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:19,865
- Sorry.
- So where are the tables?

208
00:20:19,935 --> 00:20:24,565
They're not even here yet. l don't know how
they're gonna get everything set up in time.

209
00:20:24,673 --> 00:20:27,164
l thought you were picking your cousin up.

210
00:20:27,242 --> 00:20:29,710
- l sent a car.
- Cab?

211
00:20:29,778 --> 00:20:32,542
No, the company car.

212
00:20:32,614 --> 00:20:35,344
Hey, Bob. How you doin'?

213
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:38,409
- There's the groom.
- Let me get that for you.

214
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,680
l'm fine.

215
00:20:39,755 --> 00:20:43,782
l told Marie l'd help her fix the fountain.
Best get to it. Luis.

216
00:20:43,892 --> 00:20:48,192
Dad, did you tell Reza he could use
the company car to pick up his cousin?

217
00:20:48,263 --> 00:20:50,595
Kate, honey, please. Not today.

218
00:20:50,699 --> 00:20:56,194
lf it were every now and then, fine, but there's
the condo in Palm Springs, the days off...

219
00:20:56,271 --> 00:21:01,573
why is it you can't trust Reza? l can't believe
it's because he's from the Middle East...

220
00:21:01,643 --> 00:21:05,204
Dad, please.
You brought me up better than that.

221
00:21:06,381 --> 00:21:09,441
l don't know. lt's something else.

222
00:21:10,218 --> 00:21:11,981
what?

223
00:21:17,326 --> 00:21:22,320
l don't know. Maybe l'm just having
a hard time letting go of my little sister.

224
00:21:29,938 --> 00:21:32,839
l do miss your mother so much today.

225
00:21:34,676 --> 00:21:37,167
She'd be so proud of both of you.

226
00:21:48,824 --> 00:21:51,486
- Rayburn.
- Eric, it's George again.

227
00:21:51,593 --> 00:21:54,756
- what have you got?
- Not a lot. Haven't reached Bauer.

228
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,799
- what's this about?
- Your office will be briefed.

229
00:21:57,866 --> 00:22:00,096
Just find him and bring him in.

230
00:22:00,168 --> 00:22:03,467
we're doing everything we can.
l don't think he wants to be found.

231
00:22:03,538 --> 00:22:06,632
ln his condition, l don't think
he'll be worth a damn anyway.

232
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,802
l'm not asking for your opinion.
l need this guy now.

233
00:22:09,878 --> 00:22:14,281
l refuse to believe that given your resources
you can't bring in one former agent.

234
00:22:14,349 --> 00:22:18,115
l'll tell you how you can get hold of Bauer,
but you're not gonna like it.

235
00:22:18,186 --> 00:22:22,816
- l'm listening.
- You're with the president right now, correct?

236
00:22:24,192 --> 00:22:26,558
Yeah, l am.

237
00:22:44,846 --> 00:22:48,407
This is Jack Bauer.
Leave your message after the beep.

238
00:22:48,517 --> 00:22:52,009
Hi, Jack. lt's Tony Almeida at CTU.

239
00:22:52,087 --> 00:22:56,683
l've left messages for you everywhere.
Could you please give us a call?

240
00:22:56,758 --> 00:22:58,851
lt's very important.

241
00:24:35,357 --> 00:24:38,190
This is Jack Bauer.
Leave your message after the beep.

242
00:24:38,293 --> 00:24:42,753
Hello, Mr Bauer.
l'm calling on behalf of President Palmer.

243
00:24:42,831 --> 00:24:46,961
The president needs to speak to you
on an urgent matter. Please call us back...

244
00:24:47,035 --> 00:24:51,267
- Hello?
- Mr Bauer? Please hold for the president.

245
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:53,273
Sir, l have Jack Bauer.

246
00:24:53,341 --> 00:24:55,639
- Jack?
- Mr President.

247
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:58,474
You've been avoiding
CTU's calls this morning.

248
00:24:58,547 --> 00:25:01,880
- l don't work for them anymore, sir.
- So l hear.

249
00:25:03,652 --> 00:25:05,813
How's it all going, Jack?

250
00:25:05,887 --> 00:25:09,015
- lt's been difficult, sir.
- l'm sure it has.

251
00:25:10,392 --> 00:25:15,625
- l've thought a lot about you this past year.
- Thank you, Mr President.

252
00:25:16,531 --> 00:25:18,897
l know this is a bad time,
but l need your help.

253
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,198
l've been inactive for over a year.
l can't see how l'd be of any help to anyone.

254
00:25:23,305 --> 00:25:26,502
we are in a grave situation
that requires the attention

255
00:25:26,575 --> 00:25:29,567
of all branches of our national security.

256
00:25:29,678 --> 00:25:34,172
My advisors are convinced that
you can play an important part in this effort.

257
00:25:34,249 --> 00:25:38,413
- l'm sorry, but l'm in no condition...
- Jack, listen to me.

258
00:25:39,554 --> 00:25:45,083
l know you suffered a loss, l know it's hard,
but this is not a routine request.

259
00:25:45,193 --> 00:25:46,353
Go to CTU,

260
00:25:46,428 --> 00:25:50,592
listen to what's happening,
and then make your decision.

261
00:25:53,935 --> 00:25:56,028
Jack...

262
00:25:58,573 --> 00:26:00,734
You saved my life.

263
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:06,579
l trust you as much as l trust anyone,
and now l need your help.

264
00:26:09,084 --> 00:26:11,211
when do they need me?

265
00:26:11,286 --> 00:26:13,379
Now.

266
00:26:27,435 --> 00:26:29,767
Carla, why'd you come back?

267
00:26:29,871 --> 00:26:33,637
l was supposed to wrap a gift
for Gary to take to his assistant today.

268
00:26:33,742 --> 00:26:36,210
- l can do it.
- No. l have to do it.

269
00:26:36,278 --> 00:26:37,404
why?

270
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:40,642
Because Gary likes these things done
in a very specific way.

271
00:26:40,749 --> 00:26:43,309
lt would take too long to explain it.

272
00:26:43,418 --> 00:26:45,079
OK.

273
00:26:45,153 --> 00:26:47,212
Kim...

274
00:26:49,324 --> 00:26:50,655
l'm sorry.

275
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,388
will you take Megan upstairs to play?

276
00:26:55,463 --> 00:26:57,294
Sure.

277
00:27:07,475 --> 00:27:09,841
Have you looked at your system?

278
00:27:09,944 --> 00:27:12,003
No. what's up?

279
00:27:12,914 --> 00:27:20,150
Langley issued an information flow advisory.
whatever's going on will be interagency.

280
00:27:20,255 --> 00:27:26,490
All right. Call Lindauer and Grothy and
tell them they don't have a day off after all.

281
00:27:28,296 --> 00:27:32,289
And start filtering anything that comes in.

282
00:27:53,288 --> 00:27:56,382
- Something's going on, isn't it?
- we're not sure.

283
00:27:57,792 --> 00:28:00,056
- l could do those redundancies.
- lt's OK.

284
00:28:00,161 --> 00:28:04,825
- l've studied the protocols.
- Paula, you're trying too hard.

285
00:28:07,836 --> 00:28:11,135
Just do yourjob. Everything's gonna be fine.

286
00:28:11,206 --> 00:28:14,471
Sorry. l waited to get assigned here
for two years. l just...

287
00:28:14,542 --> 00:28:18,205
Heads up. l need all department heads
over here right now.

288
00:28:18,313 --> 00:28:20,577
we've an active priority.

289
00:28:30,024 --> 00:28:33,391
l just got off a conference call
with NSA and Division.

290
00:28:33,495 --> 00:28:36,828
lt appears there's a nuclear bomb,
under terrorist control,

291
00:28:36,898 --> 00:28:42,928
somewhere here in Los Angeles, set to go off
at some point in the course of the day, so...

292
00:28:43,037 --> 00:28:45,005
From this moment on,

293
00:28:45,073 --> 00:28:50,534
we do not communicate with anybody
outside of our secured envelope.

294
00:28:50,612 --> 00:28:56,244
That means we don't call home, we don't
talk to friends, we don't call relatives.

295
00:28:56,351 --> 00:29:00,048
Ourjob is to find this device and stop it.

296
00:29:00,121 --> 00:29:02,282
we do not want to create panic.

297
00:29:03,892 --> 00:29:06,793
l know this isn't very pleasant,

298
00:29:06,895 --> 00:29:10,262
but this is ourjob, this is what we do.

299
00:29:12,434 --> 00:29:14,698
So let's do it.

300
00:29:16,571 --> 00:29:18,630
George.

301
00:29:19,707 --> 00:29:23,700
- l still haven't been able to reach Jack.
- NSA got hold of him.

302
00:29:23,778 --> 00:29:29,114
ls this why they wanted him? l mean,
he's been out of play for over a year.

303
00:29:29,217 --> 00:29:34,712
l'm guessing it has something to do
with one of his previous covers.

304
00:29:37,292 --> 00:29:42,821
ln this scenario, immediate loss of life would
be in the low thousands, relatively small.

305
00:29:42,931 --> 00:29:47,425
But the dispersal of radioactive debris
from a dirty bomb is unpredictable

306
00:29:47,502 --> 00:29:50,994
and could multiply
that figure many times over.

307
00:29:52,907 --> 00:29:57,503
l understand that we don't know whether
this is a dirty bomb or something bigger.

308
00:29:57,612 --> 00:30:00,775
Give me the worst-case scenario.

309
00:30:00,849 --> 00:30:03,682
All right. worst-case scenario.

310
00:30:05,687 --> 00:30:08,281
Stolen Soviet nuclear warhead,

311
00:30:08,356 --> 00:30:13,350
a properly configured trigger
detonated 500 feet above the city.

312
00:30:13,461 --> 00:30:18,091
Approximately 100 square miles
would be irradiated within seconds.

313
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:23,936
Apart from the loss of life, this kind of blow
would have global repercussions

314
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:26,098
that would last for years.

315
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:29,203
Thank you, Eric.

316
00:30:31,713 --> 00:30:36,480
what would you like to do about the Joint
Chiefs, sir? They're waiting to hear from you.

317
00:30:36,551 --> 00:30:38,644
l'm not ready to speak to them yet.

318
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,054
Mr President, if l could suggest
that you at least start the dialogue.

319
00:30:43,157 --> 00:30:46,388
At this point, this is not a military operation.

320
00:30:46,494 --> 00:30:51,625
lt is a potential terrorist attack,
and that's the way l'm going to approach it.

321
00:30:54,569 --> 00:30:55,797
Yes, sir.

322
00:30:56,804 --> 00:30:58,863
Thank you, everybody.

323
00:32:26,995 --> 00:32:29,759
Paula, l need you to open up
another socket for me.

324
00:32:29,831 --> 00:32:33,164
And Mason wants to see you
in the conference room.

325
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,329
Paula?

326
00:32:51,085 --> 00:32:54,418
- l don't know if l can do this.
- Of course you can do it.

327
00:32:54,956 --> 00:33:00,690
No, l'm just a programmer and l don't think
l work very well under this kind of pressure,

328
00:33:00,795 --> 00:33:04,856
so maybe they just wanna
bring somebody else in.

329
00:33:05,366 --> 00:33:08,927
Look, Paula, there is no one else.

330
00:33:09,003 --> 00:33:13,702
You're the best at what you do. You know
the system inside out. That's why you're here.

331
00:33:13,808 --> 00:33:16,504
Just take it one task at a time.

332
00:33:16,611 --> 00:33:19,637
Right now all l need you to do
is open up a couple of sockets.

333
00:33:19,714 --> 00:33:23,377
And then get to
the conference room, all right?

334
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:26,316
OK?

335
00:33:31,626 --> 00:33:33,685
OK.

336
00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:50,368
Thank you.

337
00:34:17,538 --> 00:34:19,733
Hey, Jack.

338
00:34:19,841 --> 00:34:23,106
- Hi, Tony. How you doing?
- Fine. How you been?

339
00:34:24,412 --> 00:34:26,778
l've been all right. where's George?

340
00:34:26,881 --> 00:34:29,349
He's waiting for you in the conference room.

341
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:31,510
- You've been briefed?
- Yeah.

342
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:50,062
Jack.

343
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:56,801
- Jack Bauer, Michelle Dessler...
- what am l doing here, George?

344
00:34:58,713 --> 00:35:02,547
There's a rogue nuclear weapon
here in Los Angeles, Jack.

345
00:35:02,617 --> 00:35:05,313
lntel says it's going off today.

346
00:35:09,257 --> 00:35:11,817
- How good's your intel?
- Very.

347
00:35:11,926 --> 00:35:17,626
NSA have high-probability leads
on regional cells that might be involved.

348
00:35:17,732 --> 00:35:20,599
How close are you to lDing a prime suspect?

349
00:35:21,736 --> 00:35:23,567
Not close at all.

350
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,931
That's what you're here for.

351
00:35:32,013 --> 00:35:34,243
where are you going, Jack? Jack?

352
00:35:34,949 --> 00:35:37,179
George, let me talk to him.

353
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:46,183
Jack.

354
00:35:46,294 --> 00:35:48,626
Just give me a second, Tony.

355
00:35:50,598 --> 00:35:52,964
- Hello?
- lt's me. Listen.

356
00:35:53,034 --> 00:35:56,367
- This is really important.
- Dad, l told you today, l'm not ready.

357
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:59,598
- Kim, this is not about us.
- what's it about?

358
00:36:00,675 --> 00:36:03,166
l'm at CTU. They gave me some information.

359
00:36:03,277 --> 00:36:06,110
You and l have to leave
Los Angeles together now.

360
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:10,879
No, Dad. lf you're going back to work, fine,
but you're not dragging me into it.

361
00:36:10,985 --> 00:36:15,649
l'm not trying to get back to work.
Kim, don't hang up on me.

362
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,332
Hi, this is Kim. Leave a message.

363
00:36:28,402 --> 00:36:31,860
Honey, it's me.
lf you don't wanna leave with me, fine,

364
00:36:31,973 --> 00:36:34,464
but you've got to get out of Los Angeles.

365
00:36:34,542 --> 00:36:39,070
lt's not safe for you here. Don't talk
to anybody. Just go to Aunt Carol's.

366
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:44,982
l'm gonna call her now and tell her that you're
coming. when you get there, phone me.

367
00:36:45,052 --> 00:36:48,818
Sweetheart, please,
just do this for me. Please.

368
00:36:51,192 --> 00:36:53,490
- Jack, wait a minute.
- l don't have time.

369
00:36:53,561 --> 00:36:56,826
You were called in
because it's a background match.

370
00:36:56,898 --> 00:36:59,492
You're the only one that can run with this.

371
00:36:59,567 --> 00:37:01,831
- l don't care.
- lt's not like before.

372
00:37:01,903 --> 00:37:05,532
we can get to Kim, get her out of the city,
keep her safe. l promise you.

373
00:37:05,606 --> 00:37:08,404
The best thing you can do now
is help us find that bomb.

374
00:37:08,509 --> 00:37:12,275
l trusted everybody here at CTU
to protect my wife and l lost her.

375
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:15,907
Tony, l'm not gonna
lose my daughter. l'm sorry.

376
00:37:16,017 --> 00:37:19,180
l know, Jack. l was there.

377
00:37:24,759 --> 00:37:28,923
Tony, look, l know you did
everything you could. l do.

378
00:37:31,098 --> 00:37:33,589
l just can't lose my daughter.

379
00:37:34,702 --> 00:37:36,966
l'm sorry.

380
00:37:50,451 --> 00:37:54,615
Carol, it's Jack. l wanted Kim
to get out of the city and come visit you.

381
00:37:54,722 --> 00:37:58,715
l'll explain as soon as l talk to you.
Could you do me a huge favor?

382
00:37:58,793 --> 00:38:03,389
As soon as she gets there, call me
and let me know she's safe. Thank you.

383
00:38:32,693 --> 00:38:35,127
Great, Almeida. Now what?

384
00:38:35,196 --> 00:38:39,860
- Back off, George. l did the best l could.
- l guess your best isn't very good, then.

385
00:38:39,967 --> 00:38:43,528
Maybe there's another way to find wald.

386
00:38:43,637 --> 00:38:48,438
why didn't l think of that? l bet NSA had us
bring in a burnt-out agent for the challenge.

387
00:38:48,509 --> 00:38:52,502
- Anyone could have done the job.
- Settle down, George, all right?

388
00:38:52,613 --> 00:38:55,707
Let's sit down, regroup
and figure out what we're gonna do.

389
00:38:55,816 --> 00:38:59,445
what we're gonna do?
we're gonna call NSA. Now.

390
00:39:00,521 --> 00:39:04,287
Here's the deal. l want Knoll or Grothy
to pick up my daughter

391
00:39:04,358 --> 00:39:07,191
and take her a safe distance
outside of this city.

392
00:39:07,294 --> 00:39:07,817
Done.

393
00:39:07,895 --> 00:39:10,830
l wanna be kept up to date
on their status by Tony.

394
00:39:10,898 --> 00:39:14,299
- Sorry, George. l don't trust you.
- You're gonna have to start.

395
00:39:14,368 --> 00:39:18,361
what we're up against today
none of us can walk away from.

396
00:39:18,472 --> 00:39:21,373
Tony and l'll both take care of Kim.

397
00:39:23,978 --> 00:39:26,037
l'll do it now.

398
00:39:27,681 --> 00:39:29,979
Thank you.

399
00:39:35,656 --> 00:39:38,352
Tell me about the regional cells.

400
00:39:39,894 --> 00:39:43,386
The most promising one's
headed by Joseph wald.

401
00:39:43,497 --> 00:39:44,691
Joseph wald?

402
00:39:44,765 --> 00:39:47,928
wald's been linked to a terror group
called Second wave.

403
00:39:48,035 --> 00:39:51,436
That's why it had to be you.
You put in time undercover with him.

404
00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:54,565
- l put him in jail, George.
- He's out on appeal.

405
00:39:54,675 --> 00:39:57,906
And he's actually awaiting trial
right now on new charges.

406
00:39:58,012 --> 00:40:01,709
- lf he's convicted, he goes away for life.
- what's wald's connection?

407
00:40:01,782 --> 00:40:05,843
NSA established meetings between him
and the group behind the threat.

408
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,083
- why didn't you pick wald up?
- we haven't tracked him down yet.

409
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:12,717
He's not at any of the addresses in his file.

410
00:40:12,793 --> 00:40:16,285
Are there are key witnesses
against wald in his upcoming trial?

411
00:40:16,397 --> 00:40:18,194
- There's one.
- Marshall Goren.

412
00:40:18,265 --> 00:40:21,860
- Apparently without him there's no case.
- Good. Bring him in.

413
00:40:21,936 --> 00:40:23,870
Here? what for?

414
00:40:23,938 --> 00:40:28,807
You want me to reestablish my cover
with wald. lt takes at least six weeks.

415
00:40:28,909 --> 00:40:33,812
You want me to do this in under two hours.
where's the FBl holding Goren?

416
00:40:33,914 --> 00:40:36,712
Downtown, right here in protective custody.

417
00:40:36,784 --> 00:40:39,412
Good. Bring him in. Now.

418
00:40:51,065 --> 00:40:53,966
- Scott's coming to the wedding?
- Yeah. He called.

419
00:40:54,068 --> 00:40:56,593
l thought you knew he wouldn't come.

420
00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:01,334
l dated him six years ago, honey.
He's more like a brother to me.

421
00:41:02,243 --> 00:41:04,939
ls the groom jealous?

422
00:41:05,012 --> 00:41:08,072
Jealous? lt's not a question ofjealousy.

423
00:41:08,782 --> 00:41:11,512
lt's a question of what l'm comfortable with.

424
00:41:11,619 --> 00:41:14,952
My brothers married women that
had never been with another man.

425
00:41:15,022 --> 00:41:19,425
That's what my family expects of us all.

426
00:41:19,493 --> 00:41:24,863
l see. So, instead, they have to settle
for Marie, who's what - damaged goods?

427
00:41:24,965 --> 00:41:29,527
All right, don't let him bait you.
He's just trying to push our buttons.

428
00:41:29,637 --> 00:41:33,767
l've got this guy wrapped
around my little finger and he knows it.

429
00:41:33,841 --> 00:41:36,332
Kate. Telefono.

430
00:41:40,981 --> 00:41:43,176
l'll show you the seating chart.

431
00:41:43,284 --> 00:41:45,548
Thanks.

432
00:41:45,653 --> 00:41:49,020
- Hello?
- This is Ralph Burton. ls this a bad time?

433
00:41:49,123 --> 00:41:51,819
No, Ralph. Can you hold on a second?

434
00:42:02,736 --> 00:42:05,830
Sorry, Ralph. what's up?
Didn't you get my check?

435
00:42:05,906 --> 00:42:07,897
Yes. That's not why l'm calling.

436
00:42:08,008 --> 00:42:10,533
when you asked for
a background on Reza Naiyeer,

437
00:42:10,644 --> 00:42:13,135
you were worried about
his financial integrity.

438
00:42:13,214 --> 00:42:18,015
The report you showed me said l had nothing
to worry about. Has something changed?

439
00:42:18,085 --> 00:42:21,577
Not exactly. He's done nothing wrong
at your father's company,

440
00:42:21,689 --> 00:42:25,819
and his financial dealings in the past
have been legitimate.

441
00:42:25,893 --> 00:42:27,918
Great. So what's the problem?

442
00:42:28,028 --> 00:42:30,929
l was proofing a file on another individual.

443
00:42:31,031 --> 00:42:34,432
- Reza's name came up.
- Yeah, so?

444
00:42:34,535 --> 00:42:38,699
There's a man named Syed Ali.
He's an international financier

445
00:42:38,772 --> 00:42:42,606
with ties to several terrorist organizations.

446
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:46,168
what are you saying?
Reza knows this guy Ali?

447
00:42:46,247 --> 00:42:49,444
well, according to this file,
they've had dealings.

448
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:50,744
Oh, my God.

449
00:42:50,851 --> 00:42:55,914
lt's possible that Reza's business
with Ali was legitimate,

450
00:42:56,023 --> 00:42:59,424
that Reza didn't even know
about Ali's terrorist connection.

451
00:42:59,526 --> 00:43:03,963
But if you wanna know for sure,
l'm gonna need your help.

452
00:43:07,368 --> 00:43:10,064
what do you need me to do?

453
00:43:17,611 --> 00:43:22,275
Let's not waste time. l don't want
my decisions based on speculation.

454
00:43:22,383 --> 00:43:28,720
Before l read any of the reports, l want the
sources and their reliability double-checked.

455
00:43:29,757 --> 00:43:31,816
Excuse me.

456
00:43:32,826 --> 00:43:36,284
Did you set up a comm with the Joint Chiefs
regarding response?

457
00:43:36,397 --> 00:43:37,295
No.

458
00:43:37,398 --> 00:43:41,630
The secretary of state called. They're
expecting to speak with you in five minutes.

459
00:43:41,735 --> 00:43:43,635
what?

460
00:43:46,073 --> 00:43:48,132
- Cancel it.
- Yes, sir.

461
00:43:53,681 --> 00:43:55,649
Eric.

462
00:43:55,749 --> 00:43:57,808
Yes, Mr President.

463
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:01,110
would you excuse us, please?

464
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:09,027
l thought l was clear that we're not
to burn time and energy on response.

465
00:44:09,129 --> 00:44:10,960
Of course, sir.

466
00:44:12,266 --> 00:44:15,997
Then why is there a conference call
set up with the Joint Chiefs?

467
00:44:16,103 --> 00:44:19,766
ln case you changed your mind.
lt takes time to coordinate.

468
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,934
Don't second-guess me, Eric.

469
00:44:23,844 --> 00:44:29,441
Today's gonna be a very long day, and l don't
want my own people working against me.

470
00:44:29,516 --> 00:44:33,452
Sir, l would never work against you.

471
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:47,833
Goren's gonna be here any minute.
He'll be back in your custody within the hour.

472
00:44:47,901 --> 00:44:50,199
All right, George.

473
00:44:50,304 --> 00:44:54,638
Our pals at the FBl aren't too happy.
Goren's the state's only witness against wald.

474
00:44:54,708 --> 00:44:57,575
Get what you want fast
cos l want them off my back.

475
00:44:57,678 --> 00:44:58,872
what's that?

476
00:44:58,979 --> 00:45:03,916
we're saying you were extradited to Florida
on two counts of armed robbery.

477
00:45:04,017 --> 00:45:07,180
Don't make it armed robbery -
that's not how they knew me.

478
00:45:07,254 --> 00:45:10,382
Conspiracy to transport illegal explosives.

479
00:45:10,491 --> 00:45:11,355
Got it.

480
00:45:11,425 --> 00:45:13,689
Are you gonna let me in our your plan?

481
00:45:13,761 --> 00:45:17,219
And get in touch
with a Rudi Collett, a parole officer.

482
00:45:17,331 --> 00:45:21,893
- Brief him and then put him into my cover.
- Jack.

483
00:45:22,936 --> 00:45:26,736
Look at you. You look like a bum
off the street, you're not talking to me.

484
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:30,742
l just confiscated a witness
outside of my authority based on your call.

485
00:45:30,844 --> 00:45:34,575
- Are you gonna tell me what you're doing?
- No.

486
00:45:34,681 --> 00:45:40,415
Are you losing it? l don't have the time or
the resources to clean up your messes today.

487
00:45:40,521 --> 00:45:43,217
l'm not losing it.

488
00:45:49,363 --> 00:45:52,059
Just put him in the chair.

489
00:45:55,569 --> 00:45:57,628
Thank you, gentlemen.

490
00:45:59,807 --> 00:46:02,537
Michelle, please excuse us.

491
00:46:02,609 --> 00:46:05,407
- Don't you want me to...?
- No.

492
00:46:20,127 --> 00:46:23,494
- You are Marshall Goren?
- Yeah.

493
00:46:23,597 --> 00:46:27,499
Eight counts: kidnapping a minor.
Two counts: child pornography.

494
00:46:27,601 --> 00:46:29,933
First degree murder.

495
00:46:30,003 --> 00:46:33,461
Yeah. Hey, look. l already made my deal.

496
00:46:34,675 --> 00:46:37,075
l don't need to hear this noise.

497
00:46:37,144 --> 00:46:41,672
All l gotta do is testify against wald,
and l walk.

498
00:46:57,030 --> 00:47:00,659
Get a helicopter and a backup team
ready to leave here in 15 minutes.

499
00:47:00,767 --> 00:47:03,361
- Are you out of your mind?
- You wanna find this bomb?

500
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:06,337
- This is what it's gonna take.
- Killing a witness?

501
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:10,137
People like you want results
but you never wanna get your hands dirty.

502
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:13,338
l'd start rolling up your sleeves.

503
00:47:18,385 --> 00:47:20,182
l'm gonna need a hacksaw.

504
00:48:04,498 --> 00:48:07,592
Look, Kim. Olivia's giving Kristen a haircut.

505
00:48:07,701 --> 00:48:12,934
- Olivia gave Kristen a haircut last night.
- Her hair grows really fast.

506
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:17,204
Are you a complete idiot?
l had to leave in the middle of a meeting!

507
00:48:17,277 --> 00:48:21,839
How do you think that makes me look?
You cannot possibly be this incompetent.

508
00:48:21,915 --> 00:48:26,716
Can we go somewhere else?
l don't like it when he gets like this.

509
00:48:28,055 --> 00:48:31,024
what do you mean? what does he do?

510
00:48:31,091 --> 00:48:33,389
Stay there.

511
00:48:40,434 --> 00:48:43,232
lt's gonna be fine.

512
00:48:43,971 --> 00:48:45,802
Megan.

513
00:48:46,807 --> 00:48:48,900
Sweetie.

514
00:48:50,911 --> 00:48:55,075
Megan, are you in there?
Open the door, sweetie. Now.

515
00:48:56,416 --> 00:48:58,316
Go in the bathroom.

516
00:48:58,418 --> 00:49:01,319
- Just a minute. we're in the bathroom.
- You're what?

517
00:49:01,421 --> 00:49:03,480
Be right there.

518
00:49:08,662 --> 00:49:12,826
Sorry. Megan's going through
a modest stage. No boys allowed.

519
00:49:15,302 --> 00:49:18,567
- So you guys were in the bathroom?
- Yeah.

520
00:49:22,075 --> 00:49:24,805
- You didn't hear anything?
- what do you mean?

521
00:49:26,747 --> 00:49:29,648
- Carla had a little accident. She slipped.
- ls she OK?

522
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:32,344
Yeah, she's fine. Just fine.

523
00:49:36,023 --> 00:49:39,083
- why don't you go give her a hand?
- well...

524
00:49:39,159 --> 00:49:43,459
Listen, l need a few minutes
with my daughter before l leave, OK?

525
00:49:47,034 --> 00:49:49,628
- what's the matter, petal?
- we were...

526
00:49:49,703 --> 00:49:52,866
- Did l not tell you to get outta here?
- Mommy!

527
00:49:53,774 --> 00:49:56,436
- lt's OK, Megan.
- Honey, l'm sorry.

528
00:49:56,510 --> 00:50:00,139
Daddy's had a bad... l'm sorry.
Just be quiet. Megan, shut up.

529
00:50:00,213 --> 00:50:02,511
- Megan, shut up!
- Leave her alone!

530
00:50:02,616 --> 00:50:05,312
Stay down, Kim. l will hurt you!

531
00:50:06,286 --> 00:50:07,651
Shut up, Megan!

532
00:50:22,035 --> 00:50:23,832
what? Yeah.

533
00:50:23,904 --> 00:50:27,465
Yes, l said l'd be back in a couple of minutes.

534
00:50:27,541 --> 00:50:28,803
Yeah.

535
00:50:28,875 --> 00:50:31,901
Listen, l just have to take care of something.

536
00:50:32,012 --> 00:50:34,640
