1
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,335
Ellen  
we're  going  to  be  late

2
00:00:08,335 --> 00:00:09,770
We're  right on  time

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:10,771
Besides...

4
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:12,432
the  babysitter's
not  here yet

5
00:00:13,807 --> 00:00:16,105
l'll  get  it

6
00:00:18,612 --> 00:00:20,547
Hi.  l'm  Miranda  Evans

7
00:00:20,547 --> 00:00:23,650
Danielle  
come  meet Miranda

8
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,385
Come  on  in.
l'm  Pete

9
00:00:25,385 --> 00:00:26,511
This  is  Ellen

10
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,226
Miranda    meet  Danielle

11
00:00:32,226 --> 00:00:33,360
Hi    Danielle

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,962
Hi

13
00:00:34,962 --> 00:00:36,987
Come this  way

14
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:41,101
The  agency tells  me you're
studying  child  development

15
00:00:41,101 --> 00:00:42,269
Yes    Mrs.  Randall

16
00:00:42,269 --> 00:00:44,571
l  hope to  make
child  care  my career

17
00:00:44,571 --> 00:00:46,840
Well    Danielle  should  be
easy to  care for

18
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,841
She'll  probably spend...

19
00:00:47,841 --> 00:00:50,177
most of the  evening
in  her  room

20
00:00:50,177 --> 00:00:52,212
OK.  Just a  few things

21
00:00:52,212 --> 00:00:53,213
Danielle's  allergies...

22
00:00:53,213 --> 00:00:54,414
are  listed  in
the  blue  section

23
00:00:54,414 --> 00:00:57,417
Acceptable foods  are  in
the yellow  section

24
00:00:57,417 --> 00:01:00,153
The  pink  section  contains
approved  TV  programs...

25
00:01:00,153 --> 00:01:03,090
and  phobias  are
in  the  purple  section

26
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,158
No  problem

27
00:01:05,158 --> 00:01:06,760
Emergency  numbers
are  in  the  book

28
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,162
Just call  our  cell
if you  have  any questions

29
00:01:09,162 --> 00:01:10,789
Now  we're  late

30
00:01:11,999 --> 00:01:14,368
Good  night    Pet

31
00:01:14,368 --> 00:01:15,602
Have  a  good  time

32
00:01:15,602 --> 00:01:17,371
OK    you    too.  Be  good

33
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:19,606
Bye    Mommy.
Bye    Daddy

34
00:01:19,606 --> 00:01:21,403
See you    honey

35
00:01:24,945 --> 00:01:26,680
So  l'll  bet your  room
is  pretty cool

36
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,182
l  picked  the  colors.
Do you  want to  see?

37
00:01:29,182 --> 00:01:31,673
l'd  love to

38
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,291
Miranda  Evans
has  a  bond  with  children

39
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:40,494
She  understands
their  problems    their fears

40
00:01:40,494 --> 00:01:43,430
But tonight she  will  meet
a  special  little  girl...

41
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,831
with  a  very
unique  problem...

42
00:01:44,831 --> 00:01:49,598
that will  stretch  Miranda's
bond  with  reality  itself

43
00:01:51,805 --> 00:01:54,207
That over there
is  Ursula  Unicorn

44
00:01:54,207 --> 00:01:56,109
And  this
brown  horse  is  Hans

45
00:01:56,109 --> 00:01:57,911
l  got  him  for  Christmas

46
00:01:57,911 --> 00:01:59,313
And  do you  want
to  know  a  secret?

47
00:01:59,313 --> 00:02:00,714
My  mom  doesn't  know
l  know...

48
00:02:00,714 --> 00:02:01,715
but for  my  birthday...

49
00:02:01,715 --> 00:02:03,350
l'm  getting  the  little
girl  who  rides  him...

50
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,648
a  bridle    and  a  saddle

51
00:02:11,124 --> 00:02:13,226
Wow

52
00:02:13,226 --> 00:02:16,596
These  dolls
are  beautiful

53
00:02:16,596 --> 00:02:18,894
Do they fit  in
your  dollhouse?

54
00:02:21,134 --> 00:02:22,302
They're  not
to  play with

55
00:02:22,302 --> 00:02:23,337
Why  not?

56
00:02:23,337 --> 00:02:25,739
They just aren't

57
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:28,408
We  could  play a  game

58
00:02:28,408 --> 00:02:30,811
l  have  Clue  
and  Eloise  Monopoly...

59
00:02:30,811 --> 00:02:32,746
uh    Girl  Power...

60
00:02:32,746 --> 00:02:35,415
Name  That  State－－
it's  educational

61
00:02:35,415 --> 00:02:36,983
Oh    and  l've  got
Herd  Your  Horses

62
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:38,245
l  love that game

63
00:02:45,025 --> 00:02:47,828
Herd  Your  Horses
sounds  great

64
00:02:47,828 --> 00:02:49,329
What are you  doing?

65
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:51,957
One  of the  dolls fell.
Don't you  want  me to fix  her?

66
00:02:52,999 --> 00:02:55,502
－ls there  a  key?
－l'll  do  it

67
00:02:55,502 --> 00:02:57,333
You  have to  be
really careful

68
00:03:19,893 --> 00:03:21,528
Ow!

69
00:03:21,528 --> 00:03:23,563
l'm  bleeding!

70
00:03:23,563 --> 00:03:25,065
Maybe you  cut  it
on  the  glass

71
00:03:25,065 --> 00:03:27,334
No    she  bit  me!

72
00:03:27,334 --> 00:03:30,570
What    the  doll?

73
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,572
She  couldn't  bite you  
Danielle

74
00:03:32,572 --> 00:03:33,807
She's just a  doll

75
00:03:33,807 --> 00:03:36,207
l've  got a  Kleenex

76
00:03:43,683 --> 00:03:47,020
You're traveling
to  another  dimension

77
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,791
A  dimension  not only
of sight and  sound...

78
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,884
but of  mind

79
00:03:54,327 --> 00:03:57,531
A journey  into
a  wondrous  land...

80
00:03:57,531 --> 00:03:59,733
whose  boundaries
are  only that...

81
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:01,598
of the  imagination

82
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:06,532
You're  entering...

83
00:04:15,048 --> 00:04:16,917
l  think  Shelley's  mad  at  me

84
00:04:16,917 --> 00:04:18,316
Shelley?

85
00:04:24,524 --> 00:04:26,760
And  why would
Shelley  be  mad?

86
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,095
'Cause  l  want
to  play with  you...

87
00:04:29,095 --> 00:04:31,231
and  not with  her

88
00:04:31,231 --> 00:04:32,232
Do you  get  mad
when  someone...

89
00:04:32,232 --> 00:04:34,935
doesn't want
to  play with  you?

90
00:04:34,935 --> 00:04:37,838
No    but  Shelley does

91
00:04:37,838 --> 00:04:39,306
She's  very jealous

92
00:04:39,306 --> 00:04:40,307
That  must  make  it  hard...

93
00:04:40,307 --> 00:04:41,641
when  you  have friends
over to  play

94
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:43,844
Shelley  must get
angry a  lot

95
00:04:43,844 --> 00:04:47,247
l  had  a  friend  
but she  moved  away

96
00:04:47,247 --> 00:04:48,815
And  Shelley's  a  new friend

97
00:04:48,815 --> 00:04:50,317
She thinks  l  should
just  play with  her...

98
00:04:50,317 --> 00:04:51,418
and  the  other  girls

99
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:54,154
The  other  girls?
The  dolls?

100
00:04:54,154 --> 00:04:55,355
Yeah

101
00:04:55,355 --> 00:04:56,389
But you're  my  newest friend...

102
00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:58,725
and  l'm  going  to  play
with  you...

103
00:04:58,725 --> 00:05:00,352
downstairs  
where  Shelley can't see

104
00:05:01,895 --> 00:05:03,230
OK.  Let's  go  downstairs...

105
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,357
and  make  some  cocoa
and  popcorn

106
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,401
l  can't  have  sugar
after  7:00

107
00:05:08,401 --> 00:05:09,436
Well    this  is
a  special  night

108
00:05:09,436 --> 00:05:10,604
Let's  make  an  exception

109
00:05:10,604 --> 00:05:11,605
Can  you  do that?

110
00:05:11,605 --> 00:05:12,672
Let's  go  crazy

111
00:05:12,672 --> 00:05:14,606
Cool

112
00:05:28,021 --> 00:05:29,089
l  love  chocolate

113
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:30,524
l  do    too

114
00:05:30,524 --> 00:05:31,825
Shelley doesn't

115
00:05:31,825 --> 00:05:33,827
－Really?
－Nope

116
00:05:33,827 --> 00:05:37,163
But  Katie  loves  chocolate  
the  Belgian  kind

117
00:05:37,163 --> 00:05:38,965
And  Katie  is?

118
00:05:38,965 --> 00:05:40,600
She's the  one
next to  Shelley...

119
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,935
in  the  ski  outfit

120
00:05:41,935 --> 00:05:43,870
She  went to the  snow
with  us

121
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,438
Katie's  afraid
of the  dark...

122
00:05:45,438 --> 00:05:47,941
that's  why  l  have
to  have  a  night－light

123
00:05:47,941 --> 00:05:50,810
So you're  not the  one
afraid  of the  dark

124
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,446
Well    l'm  mostly
afraid  of spiders

125
00:05:53,446 --> 00:05:55,181
Angie's  afraid
of the  water

126
00:05:55,181 --> 00:05:56,182
lsn't that weird?

127
00:05:56,182 --> 00:05:58,451
Jenny's  not afraid
of anything

128
00:05:58,451 --> 00:06:00,287
We  used  to  watch
Buffy  together

129
00:06:00,287 --> 00:06:02,355
She  wanted  Buffy and  Spike
to  hook  up

130
00:06:02,355 --> 00:06:04,124
Do you  even  know
what that  means?

131
00:06:04,124 --> 00:06:07,594
No    but Jenny
really wanted  it

132
00:06:07,594 --> 00:06:09,863
Wow.  Your  dolls
sound  like fun

133
00:06:09,863 --> 00:06:11,731
Sometimes

134
00:06:11,731 --> 00:06:13,700
Sometimes they aren't

135
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,294
Anyway    you're  my
new  best friend

136
00:06:18,204 --> 00:06:20,399
Oh    l  forgot  my game.
l'll  be  right  back

137
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,802
"The  child  is  not always
the  root of the  problem

138
00:06:48,802 --> 00:06:50,437
"Sometimes
the  child  is  gifted...

139
00:06:50,437 --> 00:06:52,806
"and  thinks  differently
than  his  or  her  peers

140
00:06:52,806 --> 00:06:54,941
"The  child  can  be
subject to fantasies...

141
00:06:54,941 --> 00:06:57,110
imaginary friends  
and  anti－social  behavior."

142
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,873
Aah!

143
00:07:01,781 --> 00:07:03,316
Danielle    what's  wrong?

144
00:07:03,316 --> 00:07:04,943
Oh    no

145
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:10,515
Shelley.  She's  gone

146
00:07:12,192 --> 00:07:13,960
Did  you  take  her  out?

147
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,729
She  got out  by  herself

148
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:17,890
lt's your fault!
You  left the  key  in!

149
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,634
Why don't you  get
the  horse  game－－

150
00:07:20,634 --> 00:07:23,837
But  Shelley
could  get  hurt!

151
00:07:23,837 --> 00:07:26,106
OK.  Where  do you
think  she  went?

152
00:07:26,106 --> 00:07:28,642
She  likes the  dark

153
00:07:28,642 --> 00:07:30,075
Then  let's  go  look
in  the  dark

154
00:07:31,544 --> 00:07:33,102
Lock the  case first

155
00:07:38,785 --> 00:07:40,887
Where's the  key?

156
00:07:40,887 --> 00:07:42,582
lt's  not there?

157
00:07:46,026 --> 00:07:47,994
l  bet  Shelley took  it

158
00:07:47,994 --> 00:07:50,597
Let's  go find  where you－－

159
00:07:50,597 --> 00:07:52,121
let's  go find  Shelley

160
00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:57,904
Where  should  we  look?

161
00:07:57,904 --> 00:08:00,407
Mom  and  Dad's  room.
lt's  really dark  in  there

162
00:08:00,407 --> 00:08:02,142
She  can  hide

163
00:08:02,142 --> 00:08:04,244
l'm  not allowed
to  go  in  there

164
00:08:04,244 --> 00:08:06,542
You  want to  wait
in  the  hall?

165
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,714
l  think  she's  downstairs

166
00:08:25,965 --> 00:08:27,956
Let's  go  see

167
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:43,717
Shelley doesn't  like
chocolate

168
00:08:43,717 --> 00:08:45,952
This  could  have
hurt someone    Danielle

169
00:08:45,952 --> 00:08:47,120
l  know

170
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,522
Why would  Shelley  be  mad
when  l  love  her  so  much?

171
00:08:49,522 --> 00:08:52,047
Sit down    OK?

172
00:08:56,629 --> 00:08:58,331
Danielle    l'm  your friend

173
00:08:58,331 --> 00:08:59,666
Do you  feel  like...

174
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,067
l'm  not  paying  enough
attention  to you?

175
00:09:01,067 --> 00:09:03,103
l  didn't  break  anything.
Shelley did

176
00:09:03,103 --> 00:09:04,237
l  told  you

177
00:09:04,237 --> 00:09:06,740
She's  mad  
and  l  don't  know  why

178
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,675
l  take  really good
care  of the  girls

179
00:09:08,675 --> 00:09:11,211
Do you  think they're  mad
at  being  locked  up?

180
00:09:11,211 --> 00:09:12,912
But that's  where they  live

181
00:09:12,912 --> 00:09:15,982
lf they get out  
they could  get  hurt    or  lost

182
00:09:15,982 --> 00:09:17,817
l  have to take  care  of them

183
00:09:17,817 --> 00:09:19,252
l'm  like their  mom

184
00:09:19,252 --> 00:09:22,388
Have  any of them  ever
gotten  out  before?

185
00:09:22,388 --> 00:09:24,856
When  you  were  upset  
maybe?

186
00:09:26,493 --> 00:09:28,695
Shelley got out once  before

187
00:09:28,695 --> 00:09:30,897
She  broke  my  mom's
Chinese teapot

188
00:09:30,897 --> 00:09:31,898
Did  you  tell  your  mom...

189
00:09:31,898 --> 00:09:33,066
that  Shelley
broke the teapot?

190
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:35,330
l  told  her
it was  an  accident

191
00:09:36,703 --> 00:09:38,505
So    when  your  mom's
not  here...

192
00:09:38,505 --> 00:09:40,206
you  don't  blame things
on  the  dolls

193
00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:42,942
You're  psychologizing  me

194
00:09:42,942 --> 00:09:44,811
You  think  l'm  making
all  this  up

195
00:09:44,811 --> 00:09:45,945
l'm  not stupid

196
00:09:45,945 --> 00:09:48,448
l  don't think
you're  stupid

197
00:09:48,448 --> 00:09:49,682
But  maybe
if you  told  your  mom...

198
00:09:49,682 --> 00:09:50,884
that you'd  rather
take the  dolls  out...

199
00:09:50,884 --> 00:09:52,919
to  play with  instead
of  locking  them  up－－

200
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:54,487
l  can't take them
out of the  case!

201
00:09:54,487 --> 00:09:57,513
l  told  you!
Why don't you  believe  me?!

202
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:03,695
Uhh!

203
00:10:07,634 --> 00:10:11,571
lt  hurts.  lt  hurts

204
00:10:11,571 --> 00:10:13,061
Shelley tripped  me

205
00:10:16,643 --> 00:10:17,844
Stay  here.
l'll  call  your  mom

206
00:10:17,844 --> 00:10:19,612
No.  We  have to  put
Shelley  back

207
00:10:19,612 --> 00:10:20,613
You're  hurt    Danielle

208
00:10:20,613 --> 00:10:21,614
l  have to  call  your  mother

209
00:10:21,614 --> 00:10:23,249
We  have to  put  her  back  now!

210
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:25,479
ln  a  minute    Danielle

211
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:34,027
Mrs.  Randall?

212
00:10:34,027 --> 00:10:36,162
Mrs.  Randall?
lt's  Miranda

213
00:10:36,162 --> 00:10:38,364
No    it's  not
an  emergency

214
00:10:38,364 --> 00:10:41,534
l  just  need  to  know  where
the first－aid  kit  is

215
00:10:41,534 --> 00:10:43,336
Danielle  cut  herself

216
00:10:43,336 --> 00:10:45,770
No    no    she's fine.
lt's just a  little  cut

217
00:10:47,307 --> 00:10:50,310
All  right    honey  
let's  go  upstairs

218
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,078
Don't  leave  Shelley

219
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:53,947
She'll  do  something  else  bad

220
00:10:53,947 --> 00:10:56,313
She's  right  here

221
00:11:04,157 --> 00:11:08,787
OK.  All  done.  Better?

222
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,395
We  have to  put
Shelley  back

223
00:11:19,739 --> 00:11:21,341
Oh    no

224
00:11:21,341 --> 00:11:23,070
They all  got out

225
00:11:24,844 --> 00:11:27,180
Danielle    where  are they?

226
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,316
l  don't  understand.
l  love them

227
00:11:30,316 --> 00:11:33,720
Danielle    sometimes  people  
even  parents...

228
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,388
don't always tell  you
that they  love you...

229
00:11:35,388 --> 00:11:36,923
but they  really do

230
00:11:36,923 --> 00:11:38,558
lf you  tell  me  where
you  put the  dolls...

231
00:11:38,558 --> 00:11:40,026
then  we  can  talk  about  how－－

232
00:11:40,026 --> 00:11:42,061
Don't you  see?
Shelley  hid  the  key...

233
00:11:42,061 --> 00:11:43,696
and  then  made  sure
we  would  go  downstairs...

234
00:11:43,696 --> 00:11:44,964
so  she  could
come  back  up  here...

235
00:11:44,964 --> 00:11:45,999
and  let them  all  out

236
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:48,134
Shelley's  a  doll  
not  Sydney  Bristow

237
00:11:48,134 --> 00:11:49,302
We  have to find  them!

238
00:11:49,302 --> 00:11:50,303
This time    you  tell  me...

239
00:11:50,303 --> 00:11:51,471
what you  did
with  the  dolls

240
00:11:51,471 --> 00:11:53,172
We  can  put them  back
and  then  go  play a  game

241
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:54,807
l  didn't do
anything  with  them!

242
00:11:54,807 --> 00:11:55,975
Shelley  let 'em  out!

243
00:11:55,975 --> 00:11:58,344
They  never  all
got out  before

244
00:11:58,344 --> 00:12:01,281
OK.  We're  going
downstairs

245
00:12:01,281 --> 00:12:02,815
l'm  going  to  do
my  homework－－

246
00:12:02,815 --> 00:12:04,317
We  can't!
We  have to find  them...

247
00:12:04,317 --> 00:12:05,852
before they do  something!

248
00:12:05,852 --> 00:12:08,582
Let's  go    drama  queen

249
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,989
Look

250
00:12:17,263 --> 00:12:20,357
Very clever  
but  it won't work

251
00:12:31,177 --> 00:12:33,611
How  did  you  do this?

252
00:12:55,435 --> 00:12:56,424
Look  out!

253
00:13:15,488 --> 00:13:17,319
That wasn't  nice  
Shelley

254
00:13:22,428 --> 00:13:23,952
That's  mine

255
00:13:25,398 --> 00:13:28,301
lsn't that a  little
grown－up for you?

256
00:13:28,301 --> 00:13:30,970
No    it fits.  See?

257
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,528
l'm  phoning  your  parents

258
00:13:40,513 --> 00:13:43,549
They  moved

259
00:13:43,549 --> 00:13:45,676
l  told  you

260
00:13:56,496 --> 00:13:58,431
Mrs.  Randall    it's  Miranda

261
00:13:58,431 --> 00:14:00,266
Look    there's  some
weird  things  going  on  here

262
00:14:00,266 --> 00:14:03,201
So    l'm  going  to take  Danielle
and  go to  my  house  until－－

263
00:14:04,804 --> 00:14:06,169
What's  wrong?

264
00:14:11,244 --> 00:14:13,940
lt's  OK.  l'm  going  to  call
your  parents  on  my cell  phone

265
00:14:24,123 --> 00:14:25,491
My  battery

266
00:14:25,491 --> 00:14:27,550
Damn  it!

267
00:14:30,296 --> 00:14:32,821
Danielle?

268
00:14:44,277 --> 00:14:45,845
"Young  children
who  play alone...

269
00:14:45,845 --> 00:14:50,283
may  be  at  increased  risk
for  later  problems."

270
00:14:50,283 --> 00:14:52,251
Shelley  
l  don't  know  what you...

271
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:54,087
and  your freaky  little
friends  are  up to...

272
00:14:54,087 --> 00:14:55,354
but  l'm  taking  Danielle...

273
00:14:55,354 --> 00:14:57,549
and  getting  out of
this  horror  movie

274
00:15:02,228 --> 00:15:04,128
Miranda    help!

275
00:15:30,323 --> 00:15:32,120
You  stupid  bitches!

276
00:15:41,267 --> 00:15:42,598
Help  me

277
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:49,008
Danielle  
are you  in  there?

278
00:15:49,008 --> 00:15:50,009
Open  the  door

279
00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:51,010
l'm  scared

280
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,278
Danielle    you  have
to  let  me  in

281
00:15:52,278 --> 00:15:53,513
l  won't  let them  hurt you

282
00:15:53,513 --> 00:15:54,502
l'm  scared

283
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:02,688
We  have to  get
out of the  house

284
00:16:02,688 --> 00:16:03,789
But they're  in  my  room

285
00:16:03,789 --> 00:16:05,491
Yes    they are    but...

286
00:16:05,491 --> 00:16:07,226
but we  can  get  past them

287
00:16:07,226 --> 00:16:08,728
l  got  past them  
didn't  l?

288
00:16:08,728 --> 00:16:10,229
They're  not after you

289
00:16:10,229 --> 00:16:12,220
l  don't get  it.
They're just dolls

290
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,001
They're  not just dolls!

291
00:16:15,001 --> 00:16:16,002
l  can  carry you

292
00:16:16,002 --> 00:16:17,336
They won't even
be  able to  reach  you

293
00:16:17,336 --> 00:16:19,906
Where  did  you  get that?

294
00:16:19,906 --> 00:16:20,940
That's  mine!

295
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,908
lt's  mine!  Give  it  back!

296
00:16:35,821 --> 00:16:38,255
That girl  in  the  picture  
she  was  wearing  this

297
00:16:43,963 --> 00:16:46,431
l  just wanted  them
to  be  my friends

298
00:16:55,007 --> 00:16:56,542
Katie...

299
00:16:56,542 --> 00:16:58,237
you  said
she  liked  chocolate

300
00:17:02,515 --> 00:17:06,586
Angie  was  afraid
of the  water

301
00:17:06,586 --> 00:17:08,721
You  watched  Buffy
with  Jenny

302
00:17:08,721 --> 00:17:10,882
You  shouldn't  have
looked  in  there!

303
00:17:12,225 --> 00:17:15,127
Don't  be  mad.
l  didn't  mean  to

304
00:17:15,127 --> 00:17:17,964
What did  you  do to them?

305
00:17:17,964 --> 00:17:20,666
They said  they were
my friends...

306
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,369
but they always  left
when  my  parents  got  back

307
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:24,937
They were  babysitters

308
00:17:24,937 --> 00:17:26,872
Your  parents  paid  them
to  look  after you...

309
00:17:26,872 --> 00:17:28,541
not to  be your friends

310
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:31,577
l  begged  them  to  stay  
but they wouldn't

311
00:17:31,577 --> 00:17:34,180
They  left    and  they
forgot about  me

312
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,849
Oh    God

313
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:38,784
The  dolls  weren't
trying  to  hurt you

314
00:17:38,784 --> 00:17:40,775
They were trying  to  warn  me

315
00:17:41,988 --> 00:17:44,523
They told  me to  leave

316
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:45,854
All  the  clues

317
00:17:47,293 --> 00:17:48,894
They're  still
trying  to  warn  me...

318
00:17:48,894 --> 00:17:49,929
to  get away from  you

319
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:52,498
Don't  be  mad!  Don't go!

320
00:17:52,498 --> 00:17:54,867
Let  me  go    Danielle!
Let  me  go!

321
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:55,868
Don't  leave!

322
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:57,737
Let go    Danielle!  Let go!

323
00:17:57,737 --> 00:18:01,173
Stay!

324
00:18:05,044 --> 00:18:07,046
Look    l  came  home...

325
00:18:07,046 --> 00:18:09,348
and  found  my daughter
hysterical  in  the  closet!

326
00:18:09,348 --> 00:18:11,217
She's  1 0!

327
00:18:11,217 --> 00:18:12,551
Yeah    well    this  is
the third  time...

328
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:13,786
a  sitter from  your  agency...

329
00:18:13,786 --> 00:18:16,389
has  walked  out
and  left  my  kid  alone!

330
00:18:16,389 --> 00:18:18,224
l  want to talk
to the  manager!

331
00:18:18,224 --> 00:18:19,225
Really    Danielle...

332
00:18:19,225 --> 00:18:20,726
these  were  all  over
the  house

333
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:22,495
Just what were you  doing?

334
00:18:22,495 --> 00:18:24,597
l  thought you  were
going  to  play quietly

335
00:18:24,597 --> 00:18:26,332
lt's  no  wonder  we  can't
keep  a  babysitter...

336
00:18:26,332 --> 00:18:28,534
when  you  behave
like  a  wild  thing

337
00:18:28,534 --> 00:18:30,369
l'm  sorry    Mommy

338
00:18:30,369 --> 00:18:35,074
l  know you  are  
but you  know the  rules

339
00:18:35,074 --> 00:18:37,167
You're  grounded  to your
room  for the  weekend

340
00:18:39,879 --> 00:18:40,880
Good  night    Danielle

341
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,081
Turn  on  my  night－light

342
00:18:42,081 --> 00:18:44,174
For  Katie

343
00:19:03,536 --> 00:19:05,838
You  were  all  so  bad

344
00:19:05,838 --> 00:19:07,773
l  have to  ground  you
forever

345
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:11,610
You're  never
getting  out again

346
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,679
l  wish  you'd  stop  hating  me

347
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,816
lt'd  be  nicer
if we  were  all  friends

348
00:19:16,816 --> 00:19:18,477
But you  know the  rules

349
00:19:20,219 --> 00:19:25,324
This  is your
new friend  Miranda

350
00:19:25,324 --> 00:19:27,622
Now you  all  be  nice to  her

351
00:19:36,402 --> 00:19:38,571
Miranda  Evans
thought she  could  help...

352
00:19:38,571 --> 00:19:40,740
a  little  girl
overcome  her fears

353
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,341
Now    Miranda
will  be  able to  ponder...

354
00:19:42,341 --> 00:19:43,576
the true  meaning  of fear...

355
00:19:43,576 --> 00:19:48,240
from  inside  a  glass  prison
known  as the  Twilight Zone
