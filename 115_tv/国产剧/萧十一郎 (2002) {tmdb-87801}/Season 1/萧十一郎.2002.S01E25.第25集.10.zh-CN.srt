1
00:00:13,852 --> 00:00:15,020
－Hey    Ali.
－Hey

2
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,388
Coffee    black    shot of espresso

3
00:00:16,388 --> 00:00:17,723
Oh    you  better  make  it
a  double  shot

4
00:00:17,723 --> 00:00:19,291
One  of those  days    huh?

5
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:20,459
Why would  today
be  any different?

6
00:00:20,459 --> 00:00:23,028
－The  usual    Dev?
－Chai  tea    no  sugar  added

7
00:00:23,028 --> 00:00:26,164
Aw    that's  my  boyfriend  
the  health  nut

8
00:00:26,164 --> 00:00:29,134
“Family of  hobbits found  living
near  Mendocino.”

9
00:00:29,134 --> 00:00:30,302
How  pathetic!

10
00:00:30,302 --> 00:00:31,870
l  don't  know
why  people  waste their  money

11
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,007
Me    neither.  l  mean  
does  anyone  believe this  crap?

12
00:00:35,007 --> 00:00:37,309
lt's  not crap.  lt's funny

13
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:39,044
Then  why aren't  l  laughing?

14
00:00:39,044 --> 00:00:40,846
Obviously  
you  don't get the joke

15
00:00:40,846 --> 00:00:43,715
-You  act  like you  wrote this.
－She  did

16
00:00:43,715 --> 00:00:46,275
－Poor thing.
－Pays the  bills

17
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:48,879
Thanks

18
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:52,724
l  had  better  get to  work

19
00:00:52,724 --> 00:00:56,128
Yeah.  l'll  see you  at  home.
l  love you

20
00:00:56,128 --> 00:00:57,288
Love you    too    babe

21
00:00:59,398 --> 00:01:00,558
Hi.  Can  l－－

22
00:01:05,771 --> 00:01:09,274
There's  no  reason
for you  to  be  ashamed

23
00:01:09,274 --> 00:01:12,209
So    you're  saying
he'll  forgive  me?

24
00:01:14,947 --> 00:01:18,116
Tonight  
you  will  have your  answer

25
00:01:18,116 --> 00:01:21,086
That's－-that's  wonderful

26
00:01:21,086 --> 00:01:22,721
l  don't  know  how to thank you

27
00:01:22,721 --> 00:01:26,124
Are you  sure
l  can't  pay you  or…

28
00:01:26,124 --> 00:01:28,649
No.  No    no.  Keep your  money

29
00:01:30,562 --> 00:01:32,531
Thank you

30
00:01:32,531 --> 00:01:34,226
Really

31
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:47,840
Sir    are you
some  kind  of fortune-teller?

32
00:01:49,114 --> 00:01:52,417
Each  of  us  has  a  path
we're  meant to travel

33
00:01:52,417 --> 00:01:53,748
l  can  help  show the  way

34
00:01:54,987 --> 00:01:56,614
And  you  don't charge  a  fee?

35
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,325
l  was  born  with  this  gift

36
00:02:00,325 --> 00:02:02,160
l  choose to  share  it

37
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,684
How  noble

38
00:02:06,098 --> 00:02:07,463
What's the  catch?

39
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:10,769
There  isn't one

40
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:13,294
Oh    that would  be  a  first!

41
00:02:15,173 --> 00:02:16,333
OK

42
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,635
Let's  see  what you  got

43
00:02:52,944 --> 00:02:55,213
You're  unhappy at work

44
00:02:55,213 --> 00:02:59,274
Who  isn't?  Come  on.
You  can  do  better than  that

45
00:03:02,687 --> 00:03:04,423
All  right.
Any chance  l'll  get a  new job?

46
00:03:04,423 --> 00:03:06,914
l've  been  sending  out  resumes
for  weeks

47
00:03:07,993 --> 00:03:12,259
An  opportunity awaits you  
but you  must seek  it out first

48
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,267
That's  it?

49
00:03:17,436 --> 00:03:19,336
That's  enough

50
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,270
Thank you

51
00:03:29,915 --> 00:03:31,439
You  get what you  pay for

52
00:03:33,452 --> 00:03:34,986
The future－－

53
00:03:34,986 --> 00:03:37,222
we'd  all  like to  know
what's  in  store for  us

54
00:03:37,222 --> 00:03:40,725
Ali  Warner  has just  been  given
a  glimpse  into  hers

55
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:42,327
Now  she's  about to  go
down  a  path…

56
00:03:42,327 --> 00:03:46,286
that will  lead  her  deep
into the  Twilight Zone

57
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:51,136
You  are traveling
to  another  dimension－－

58
00:03:51,136 --> 00:03:54,940
a  dimension  
not only of sight and  sound…

59
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,339
but of  mind

60
00:03:58,076 --> 00:04:01,213
A journey
into  a  wondrous  land…

61
00:04:01,213 --> 00:04:05,081
whose  boundaries  are  only
that of the  imagination

62
00:04:08,353 --> 00:04:10,082
You're  entering…

63
00:04:17,195 --> 00:04:20,926
Now  we  come to  Pisces!  Health

64
00:04:22,267 --> 00:04:23,935
You're  not a  Pisces    are you?

65
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:26,605
How  many times  have you  asked
me that?  l'm  a  Sagittarius

66
00:04:26,605 --> 00:04:28,940
Well    lucky you    because
the  cold  and  flu  season…

67
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,277
is  going  to  be  hitting  Pisces
with  a  vengeance  next week

68
00:04:32,277 --> 00:04:34,779
－Or  so  say the  stars.
－Stars?  What stars?

69
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:37,115
You're the  only astrologer  in
the  world  who  uses  a  dartboard

70
00:04:37,115 --> 00:04:39,117
Oh    darts    stars.
They're the  same thing

71
00:04:39,117 --> 00:04:40,619
At  least they are
at the  National  Bystander

72
00:04:40,619 --> 00:04:41,786
Thank you

73
00:04:41,786 --> 00:04:44,789
You  know    you've  had  that  phone
glued  to your  ear  all  day

74
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:46,791
l'm  not working  at this  rag
forever

75
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,760
You  sent those  resumes  out  
what?  Weeks  ago

76
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,195
You  never  even  got a  nibble.
Now just  because…

77
00:04:50,195 --> 00:04:53,932
some  coffee  shop  con  artist
says that opportunity awaits－－

78
00:04:53,932 --> 00:04:55,133
Yes

79
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:56,768
You're  with
the  National  Bystander?

80
00:04:56,768 --> 00:04:58,470
That's  right.  Allison  Warner

81
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,838
OK.  We tried  contacting  you
via  e－mail

82
00:04:59,838 --> 00:05:01,339
－Really?
-Yeah    a  few  days  ago

83
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:04,843
You  know    my e－mail
was  down  for  a  couple  of days

84
00:05:04,843 --> 00:05:06,378
－Can  you  come  in  tomorrow?
－Tomorrow

85
00:05:06,378 --> 00:05:08,046
Yeah    yeah  
you  bet  l  can  be there!

86
00:05:08,046 --> 00:05:09,638
－2:00  p.m.
－Thank you

87
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:19,057
－Tell  me.
－That was  Brash  magazine

88
00:05:19,057 --> 00:05:21,092
They  read  my  resume  
and  they want to  interview  me

89
00:05:21,092 --> 00:05:23,151
No  way.  For  a  job?
Get outta  here!

90
00:05:25,664 --> 00:05:28,900
The  guy  in  the  coffee  shop

91
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,889
He  was  right

92
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:33,334
Ooh!

93
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:37,997
All  right.  Scorpio

94
00:05:52,524 --> 00:05:54,125
Hey!

95
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,457
l  have  a  job  interview
this  morning

96
00:05:58,063 --> 00:06:00,198
Congratulations

97
00:06:00,198 --> 00:06:03,268
Thanks

98
00:06:03,268 --> 00:06:08,262
Can  l  buy you  a  cup  of coffee
or  a  pastry or  something?

99
00:06:09,474 --> 00:06:11,772
l'm  sorry.
l  don't even  know your  name

100
00:06:13,278 --> 00:06:14,512
lt's  Kanayo

101
00:06:14,512 --> 00:06:18,850
And  thank you    but  l'm
quite  content at the  moment

102
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,853
l  feel  like  l  owe you.  l  mean…

103
00:06:21,853 --> 00:06:24,389
l  don't  know  if  l  believe
in  all  this  prediction  stuff…

104
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:26,324
but  if  it wasn't for you…

105
00:06:26,324 --> 00:06:29,293
l  would  have  never followed  up
on  all  those  resumes

106
00:06:30,929 --> 00:06:33,431
Well    l'm  glad
l  could  be  of  help

107
00:06:33,431 --> 00:06:36,868
The thing  is  
l  really want this job

108
00:06:36,868 --> 00:06:39,004
lt's  with  Brash  magazine

109
00:06:39,004 --> 00:06:40,905
Have you  ever  read  it?

110
00:06:40,905 --> 00:06:43,074
No    l  don't think  so

111
00:06:43,074 --> 00:06:45,410
Well    it's…  Trust  me

112
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,847
lt's  a  great opportunity.
Like you  said

113
00:06:48,847 --> 00:06:51,783
lt's  a  chance for  me to  write
something  smart for  a  change

114
00:06:51,783 --> 00:06:54,752
And  you're  concerned
you  won't get the job?

115
00:06:56,921 --> 00:07:00,091
Oh    really  
l  just came to  say thank you

116
00:07:00,091 --> 00:07:01,760
l  didn't come
for  another  reading

117
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,029
l  know.  l  know

118
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:06,064
But you  have just  begun
to follow your  path

119
00:07:06,064 --> 00:07:08,396
Don't you  want to  see
where  it  leads you?

120
00:07:12,304 --> 00:07:13,566
All  right

121
00:07:15,373 --> 00:07:17,068
l  can't  believe  l'm  doing  this

122
00:07:28,386 --> 00:07:30,588
You  have  nothing  to  worry about

123
00:07:30,588 --> 00:07:35,082
You  mean  l'm  gonna  get the job?

124
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,761
How  do you  know?

125
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,268
lt's  not what  l  know

126
00:07:43,268 --> 00:07:45,065
lt's  what  l  see

127
00:07:46,204 --> 00:07:47,831
What do you  see?

128
00:07:51,309 --> 00:07:52,776
A  secret admirer

129
00:08:01,753 --> 00:08:02,913
Ali

130
00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:05,949
Ali  Warner

131
00:08:07,025 --> 00:08:09,027
Remember  me?

132
00:08:09,027 --> 00:08:11,129
Brad  Holman

133
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:13,597
－From  Carson  High?
-You're  lookin'  at  him!

134
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:18,970
Wait    we  were  on  the  school
newspaper together    right?

135
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,872
Yeah.  Even  back then
you  were  a  terrific  writer

136
00:08:20,872 --> 00:08:23,308
Really?  You  never  said  anything

137
00:08:23,308 --> 00:08:26,711
Well    that's  because
l  had  a  real  crush  on  you

138
00:08:26,711 --> 00:08:28,713
No    no.  Don't worry.
That's  not why you're  here

139
00:08:28,713 --> 00:08:31,316
l'm  married.
We're  expecting  a  child  in  July

140
00:08:31,316 --> 00:08:32,884
Oh

141
00:08:32,884 --> 00:08:35,687
So    l've  been  reading  some
of your  stuff  in  the  Bystander

142
00:08:35,687 --> 00:08:38,623
Don't tell  me.  You  read  it
in  the  checkout  line

143
00:08:38,623 --> 00:08:40,325
No    no.
lt's  actually very funny

144
00:08:40,325 --> 00:08:42,127
-You  think?
－Absolutely

145
00:08:42,127 --> 00:08:43,495
ln  fact    l  think
your  sense  of  humor…

146
00:08:43,495 --> 00:08:45,326
would  fit  in  perfectly with
what we're  doing  here  at  Brash

147
00:08:47,265 --> 00:08:48,633
Are you  saying
that  l  have the job?

148
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:52,804
Well    there  is
one  potential  problem

149
00:08:52,804 --> 00:08:55,707
Chicago?
You  can't  move to  Chicago

150
00:08:55,707 --> 00:08:56,908
Why  not?

151
00:08:56,908 --> 00:08:59,911
'Cause you  can't  leave  me  here
all  alone  is  why  not

152
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:01,212
l'll  come  back  and  visit

153
00:09:01,212 --> 00:09:03,715
Oh    that  is  so  cold

154
00:09:03,715 --> 00:09:05,483
Oh    my God.  You've  already
made  up your  mind    haven't you?

155
00:09:05,483 --> 00:09:07,318
You  can't get out of  here
fast enough!

156
00:09:07,318 --> 00:09:08,478
Do you  blame  me?

157
00:09:09,487 --> 00:09:10,855
Can  l  come    too?

158
00:09:10,855 --> 00:09:12,991
Maybe  Brash  needs
a  new  astrologer    you  know?

159
00:09:12,991 --> 00:09:15,593
－l  can  bring  my own  dartboard.
－l'll  ask

160
00:09:15,593 --> 00:09:18,430
Oh    l  take  back  everything  bad
l  ever  said  about you

161
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,865
－So    when  do you  leave?
－l  fly out  in  a  day or  so…

162
00:09:20,865 --> 00:09:22,167
but  l  won't actually
make the final  move…

163
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:23,735
-for  a  couple  weeks.
－Man

164
00:09:23,735 --> 00:09:27,605
Which  is  good  because there's
no  way  l'm  leaving  Devin

165
00:09:27,605 --> 00:09:29,374
l'm  not sure  how  he's  going
to feel  about the  move

166
00:09:29,374 --> 00:09:32,710
Hey    l  could  always
consult the  stars

167
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,912
But you'd  probably
rather talk…

168
00:09:33,912 --> 00:09:35,346
to your  psychic  friend
over  at the  Mocha  Junkie

169
00:09:35,346 --> 00:09:38,283
－What's  his  name?
-You  mean  Kanayo?

170
00:09:38,283 --> 00:09:40,251
He's  not  my  psychic

171
00:09:40,251 --> 00:09:42,487
But you  do  have to  admit…

172
00:09:42,487 --> 00:09:45,356
he  was  right
about  my job  interview…

173
00:09:45,356 --> 00:09:46,891
and  my secret admirer

174
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:49,527
Ali    sweetie    let  me
fill  you  in  on  a  little  concept

175
00:09:49,527 --> 00:09:50,695
OK?  You  might  have  heard  of  it

176
00:09:50,695 --> 00:09:54,032
lt's  called  coincidence  
as  in  lucky guess

177
00:09:54,032 --> 00:09:57,268
Well    l  wouldn't  mind
a  few  more  lucky guesses

178
00:09:57,268 --> 00:09:59,270
You  don't  really  believe this
guy's for  real    though    do you?

179
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,072
l  never  said  l  did    but－－

180
00:10:01,072 --> 00:10:04,042
Hey    why don't you  meet  me  at
Mocha  Junkie tomorrow  morning…

181
00:10:04,042 --> 00:10:05,643
and  you  can  judge for yourself?

182
00:10:05,643 --> 00:10:06,871
All  right

183
00:10:08,112 --> 00:10:09,948
lt  looks  like
l'm  going  to  be  moving…

184
00:10:09,948 --> 00:10:15,453
to  Chicago
for  a    you  know    a  new job

185
00:10:15,453 --> 00:10:17,922
And  l'm  just worried
about  my  boyfriend

186
00:10:17,922 --> 00:10:20,124
He's  not sure  whether
he  wants to  move to  Chicago…

187
00:10:20,124 --> 00:10:21,793
and  l  don't want to  lose  him

188
00:10:21,793 --> 00:10:23,928
We've  been  together
for  almost a  year  now

189
00:10:23,928 --> 00:10:28,262
Do you  think there's  any way
that  he'll  come  with  me?

190
00:10:40,278 --> 00:10:43,042
The  eyes  closing.
That's  a  nice touch

191
00:10:47,352 --> 00:10:48,987
l'll  tell  you  
if  he  starts talking…

192
00:10:48,987 --> 00:10:50,488
in  my Aunt  Ruth's  voice  
l  am  out of  here!

193
00:10:50,488 --> 00:10:51,648
Shh!

194
00:10:58,563 --> 00:11:00,865
Go  home…

195
00:11:00,865 --> 00:11:02,457
and  you  will  find  your  answer

196
00:11:05,003 --> 00:11:07,733
That's  it?
ls that the  best you  can  do?

197
00:11:08,873 --> 00:11:10,431
lt's  enough

198
00:11:12,443 --> 00:11:13,774
Devin!

199
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,040
Devin!

200
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,118
Well    l  know the  answer  now

201
00:11:20,118 --> 00:11:22,120
Anyone  who  still  listens
to  heavy  metal  music…

202
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,721
doesn't deserve
to  go to  Chicago

203
00:11:23,721 --> 00:11:25,313
Devin－－

204
00:11:31,195 --> 00:11:33,095
Devin    you  bastard

205
00:11:35,133 --> 00:11:38,636
OK    so that's flight  355…

206
00:11:38,636 --> 00:11:40,905
and  it  leaves tomorrow  night
at 7:45

207
00:11:40,905 --> 00:11:43,533
-Yes    that's  correct.
－All  right    great.  Thanks

208
00:11:50,615 --> 00:11:53,618
What  is  it?  l'm  only going
for  a  couple  of days

209
00:11:53,618 --> 00:11:55,420
That's  not  it

210
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,256
Oh    l  get  it

211
00:11:58,256 --> 00:12:01,248
You're  pissed
because  Kanayo  was  right again

212
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,762
l  just don't think
you  should  see  him  anymore

213
00:12:04,762 --> 00:12:05,964
Why  not?

214
00:12:05,964 --> 00:12:08,499
'Cause  at some  point  
he's  going  to  be  wrong…

215
00:12:08,499 --> 00:12:10,501
and  you're  going
to  have to  pay for  it

216
00:12:10,501 --> 00:12:13,129
－ls that a  prediction    Seth?
－l'm  not joking

217
00:12:14,606 --> 00:12:16,874
lf  he's there
when  l  get  my  morning  coffee…

218
00:12:16,874 --> 00:12:18,076
l'll  talk to  him

219
00:12:18,076 --> 00:12:20,044
lf  he's  not    it's  no  big  deal

220
00:12:27,819 --> 00:12:29,821
You're  here  early

221
00:12:29,821 --> 00:12:31,789
Can't get enough  of your  coffee

222
00:12:46,304 --> 00:12:48,295
－Thanks    Tony.
-You're  welcome

223
00:12:51,643 --> 00:12:53,711
－Hey    man.
－Hey

224
00:12:53,711 --> 00:12:55,372
Get the  usual?

225
00:12:56,814 --> 00:12:58,475
Cool

226
00:13:02,954 --> 00:13:05,422
Hi    Kanayo

227
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:19,100
Thank you

228
00:13:20,672 --> 00:13:22,774
l'm  flying  out to  Chicago
tonight…

229
00:13:22,774 --> 00:13:26,711
to  meet with  my  new  bosses  
and  l  just wondered…

230
00:13:26,711 --> 00:13:29,771
if there  was  anything
l  should  know

231
00:13:59,744 --> 00:14:00,904
What  is  it?

232
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,182
What's  wrong?

233
00:14:04,182 --> 00:14:07,674
l  would  not do  any traveling
at this time

234
00:14:09,353 --> 00:14:12,186
Are you  saying  that
l  shouldn't go to  Chicago?

235
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,960
lt  is  not your  path

236
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,029
But  l  have to  go

237
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:20,732
l  may  never  get
another  offer  like this

238
00:14:20,732 --> 00:14:26,102
l  can  only advise you.
The  decision  is yours to  make

239
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:42,653
－Hello?
－Ali?  You're  still  there

240
00:14:42,653 --> 00:14:45,089
l  know  it sounds  crazy  
but  Kanayo told  me  not to  go

241
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:48,286
Well    thank  God  you  didn't!
Turn  on  the  news

242
00:14:50,628 --> 00:14:51,796
…received  an  update

243
00:14:51,796 --> 00:14:53,464
There  appear to  be  no  survivors

244
00:14:53,464 --> 00:14:57,535
To  repeat once  again  
flight  355  has  crashed…

245
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,637
ninety  miles  outside  of Chicago

246
00:14:59,637 --> 00:15:02,273
Sources  at the  National
Transportation  Safety  Board…

247
00:15:02,273 --> 00:15:03,908
Flight  355?

248
00:15:03,908 --> 00:15:05,309
Focusing  on  engine failure…

249
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,744
as the  probable  cause
of the  accident

250
00:15:06,744 --> 00:15:10,481
－That was  my flight.
－Ali    are you  seeing  this?

251
00:15:10,481 --> 00:15:12,316
Ali    are you  there?

252
00:15:12,316 --> 00:15:16,587
Ali?
Ali    answer  me.  Are you  there?

253
00:15:16,587 --> 00:15:18,418
Ali

254
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,424
l  still  can't  believe
that you  were  so  right…

255
00:15:20,424 --> 00:15:22,927
about  me  not taking  that  plane

256
00:15:22,927 --> 00:15:24,428
But what  l  really  need
to  know…

257
00:15:24,428 --> 00:15:25,930
is  how  long
l  should  avoid  travel

258
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,899
l  mean    my car
isn't ever  going  to  make  it…

259
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:31,235
all  the  way to  Chicago  
but what about a  train  or  a  bus?

260
00:15:31,235 --> 00:15:32,403
l  mean    what's  important…

261
00:15:32,403 --> 00:15:34,098
is that  my  path
still  leads  me there    right?

262
00:15:40,778 --> 00:15:43,838
－What?  Don't tell  me  it's－－
－Shh!

263
00:15:50,421 --> 00:15:52,957
－l  can't  help you.
－What?  Why  not?

264
00:15:52,957 --> 00:15:56,859
-You  must clear your  mind.
－OK    fine.  How  do  l  do that?

265
00:15:57,962 --> 00:15:59,564
Maybe you  should  come  back
tomorrow

266
00:15:59,564 --> 00:16:01,632
No    l  cannot come  back tomorrow

267
00:16:01,632 --> 00:16:03,835
l  need  to  know  now.
l  have  so  many questions

268
00:16:03,835 --> 00:16:05,636
lf  l'm  not going  to take
the job    then  l  have to  know…

269
00:16:05,636 --> 00:16:08,105
because  l've  already given
the  Bystander  my  2  weeks  notice

270
00:16:08,105 --> 00:16:11,008
Please    please.  Come  back  later

271
00:16:11,008 --> 00:16:13,611
No!  l  need  to  know

272
00:16:13,611 --> 00:16:16,514
And  you  will…

273
00:16:16,514 --> 00:16:18,573
later

274
00:16:32,263 --> 00:16:34,458
He's  all  yours

275
00:16:45,109 --> 00:16:47,278
Like  a  moth  to  a  flame

276
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:50,615
You  just can't stay away  
can  you?

277
00:16:50,615 --> 00:16:53,217
Well    look  at those two.
l'm  sure they're  asking  him…

278
00:16:53,217 --> 00:16:54,852
what  movie
they should  see tonight

279
00:16:54,852 --> 00:16:56,854
Those  dilettantes!

280
00:16:56,854 --> 00:16:58,890
l'm  glad
you  can  laugh  about this

281
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,825
Ali    believe  me  
l  am  not  laughing

282
00:17:03,628 --> 00:17:05,196
Look  at you

283
00:17:05,196 --> 00:17:06,564
Look  at you    honey.
You're  a  mess

284
00:17:06,564 --> 00:17:09,233
OK    come  on.  You  and  l  
we're taking  a  walk.  Let's  go

285
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:11,895
Do  not  make  me  drag  you
out of  here.  Let's  go.  Come  on

286
00:17:13,537 --> 00:17:15,506
OK    Seth    enough  already

287
00:17:15,506 --> 00:17:17,642
Look    l  know you
had  a  bit of a  rough  night－－

288
00:17:17,642 --> 00:17:18,943
Rough  night?
lf  it wasn't for  Kanayo…

289
00:17:18,943 --> 00:17:21,012
l  would  be  dead    along  with
those  people  on  the  plane

290
00:17:21,012 --> 00:17:22,747
All  right.
Let's just say this  guy…

291
00:17:22,747 --> 00:17:24,415
really does  have the  power
to  predict the future－－

292
00:17:24,415 --> 00:17:26,751
－The  man  saved  my  life.
－OK.  He  saved  your  life

293
00:17:26,751 --> 00:17:28,452
But  it's  still  your  life  
isn't  it?

294
00:17:28,452 --> 00:17:31,088
l  mean    come  on    you  can't  let
this  guy decide your  every  move

295
00:17:31,088 --> 00:17:32,356
Even  if what  he  predicts
is true?

296
00:17:32,356 --> 00:17:33,758
No    especially  if  it's true

297
00:17:33,758 --> 00:17:34,926
Sweetie  
if you're  not careful…

298
00:17:34,926 --> 00:17:36,093
you  won't  be  able
to  cross the  street…

299
00:17:36,093 --> 00:17:37,261
without getting  his  OK

300
00:17:37,261 --> 00:17:38,729
Oh    God.  Come  on

301
00:17:38,729 --> 00:17:40,865
Am  l－－do you  really think
l  look that  pathetic?

302
00:17:40,865 --> 00:17:43,234
Look    it's  simple.  Kanayo  says
each  one  of  us  has  a  path

303
00:17:43,234 --> 00:17:45,236
l  just  need  to  make  sure
that  l  am  on  the  right one

304
00:17:45,236 --> 00:17:46,470
Ali    do you  hear yourself?

305
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,072
l  have
a  lot of  important questions…

306
00:17:48,072 --> 00:17:49,240
that  need  to  be  answered

307
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,841
l  need  a  new job.
l  need  a  new  boyfriend

308
00:17:50,841 --> 00:17:52,009
You  don't  need!

309
00:17:52,009 --> 00:17:55,536
Honey    you  don't  need  Kanayo
to  do  any of those things

310
00:17:58,282 --> 00:18:00,546
Yeah    yeah    yeah

311
00:18:03,788 --> 00:18:06,057
l  don't  believe this.
l  don't  believe this!

312
00:18:06,057 --> 00:18:07,558
After  everything
that  l  have just said…

313
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:08,859
you're  still  thinking
about going  back  in  there?

314
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:12,496
Shh!
You  know  what?  That's  right

315
00:18:12,496 --> 00:18:14,365
And  it's  my decision

316
00:18:14,365 --> 00:18:16,801
Well    fine    then.
Get your fix    OK?

317
00:18:16,801 --> 00:18:19,031
l'll  visit you  in  rehab

318
00:18:20,838 --> 00:18:23,808
－Hey    where'd  Kanayo  go?
-You  just  missed  him

319
00:18:23,808 --> 00:18:25,609
Do you  know  where  he  lives
or  where  he  works?

320
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:26,777
Not a  clue

321
00:18:26,777 --> 00:18:28,245
Well    what about a  phone  number?

322
00:18:28,245 --> 00:18:30,047
l  really  need
to  get  in  touch  with  him

323
00:18:30,047 --> 00:18:32,683
Sorry    Ali.  They come    they
drink their  coffee    they go

324
00:18:32,683 --> 00:18:34,785
What about a  last  name?  Come  on  
help  me  out  here    please?

325
00:18:34,785 --> 00:18:37,455
Look    he told  me  once    but
don't ask  me to  pronounce  it

326
00:18:37,455 --> 00:18:39,855
Yeah

327
00:18:53,104 --> 00:18:56,374
Ali    it's  closing  time

328
00:18:56,374 --> 00:18:59,468
Hey    he's  usually  here
first thing  in  the  morning

329
00:19:01,045 --> 00:19:02,239
Come  on

330
00:19:13,257 --> 00:19:15,459
Hi    this  is  Ali

331
00:19:15,459 --> 00:19:17,628
Flying  cockroaches
invade  Cleveland

332
00:19:17,628 --> 00:19:20,197
Read  all  about  it
in  the  National  Bystander

333
00:19:20,197 --> 00:19:22,533
And  leave  a  message
after the  beep

334
00:19:22,533 --> 00:19:25,593
Ali?  Ali    pick  it  up.
l  know you're there

335
00:19:27,204 --> 00:19:29,106
lf you  don't want to  pick  up  
that's  OK

336
00:19:29,106 --> 00:19:31,075
l  just want to  say  l'm  sorry  
all  right?

337
00:19:31,075 --> 00:19:33,477
l  was－－l  was
a  little  harsh  today

338
00:19:33,477 --> 00:19:36,047
l  have  no  right to tell  you
how to  live your  life

339
00:19:36,047 --> 00:19:37,281
You're  a  strong  person

340
00:19:37,281 --> 00:19:39,183
You  always  make
the  right decisions…

341
00:19:39,183 --> 00:19:42,686
and  l'm  sure
this time you  will    too

342
00:19:42,686 --> 00:19:45,951
l'm  at  home  if you  need  to talk.
Bye

343
00:20:01,205 --> 00:20:02,866
Oh    my God!

344
00:20:04,542 --> 00:20:06,476
Kanayo!

345
00:20:18,689 --> 00:20:21,425
－Kanayo.  Where  is  he?
－He's  already come  and  gone

346
00:20:21,425 --> 00:20:22,993
No    no    no    no    no!
That can't  be!

347
00:20:22,993 --> 00:20:25,120
He just walked  out the  door.
You  should  be  able to－－

348
00:20:32,103 --> 00:20:33,934
Kanayo!

349
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,172
Kanayo!

350
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,213
Kanayo!

351
00:20:57,728 --> 00:20:59,096
Kanayo!

352
00:20:59,096 --> 00:21:01,132
Kanayo    wait!

353
00:21:01,132 --> 00:21:02,224
Hey

354
00:21:07,538 --> 00:21:09,607
No!

355
00:21:09,607 --> 00:21:11,442
No!

356
00:21:11,442 --> 00:21:15,312
Kanayo!  Kanayo    please!

357
00:21:15,312 --> 00:21:16,881
Oh    God.  Oh    God

358
00:21:16,881 --> 00:21:18,616
Hang  on    Kanayo.
You're  gonna  be  OK

359
00:21:18,616 --> 00:21:20,818
You  have to  be  OK.  l  need  you

360
00:21:20,818 --> 00:21:23,354
l  need  you  to  help  me
get  me  back  on  my  path

361
00:21:23,354 --> 00:21:25,623
l  can't find  it without you

362
00:21:25,623 --> 00:21:29,326
What  is  it?
What are you  trying  to  say?

363
00:21:29,326 --> 00:21:31,191
What  is  it?

364
00:21:33,063 --> 00:21:37,034
No!  You  can't die!
Don't  leave  me!

365
00:21:37,034 --> 00:21:38,269
Please!  Kanayo!

366
00:21:38,269 --> 00:21:41,772
Don't  leave  me!
What am  l  supposed  to  do?

367
00:21:41,772 --> 00:21:44,708
l  don't  know  what  my  path  is!

368
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:47,745
What's  going  to  happen  to  me?

369
00:21:47,745 --> 00:21:50,548
Where  am  l  going?

370
00:21:50,548 --> 00:21:52,683
Where  am  l  going?

371
00:21:52,683 --> 00:21:54,014
Oh    God    where  am  l  going?

372
00:21:56,754 --> 00:21:58,322
By seeking  a  path
to  her future…

373
00:21:58,322 --> 00:22:01,392
Ali  Warner  put  her  destiny
into the  hands  of another

374
00:22:01,392 --> 00:22:04,461
And  now that  path
has  become  a  dead  end…

375
00:22:04,461 --> 00:22:08,065
filled  with  helplessness  
despair    and  boundless  dread

376
00:22:08,065 --> 00:22:12,069
Ms.  Ali  Warner    facing
the  bleakest of futures…

377
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:13,237
in  the  Twilight Zone

378
00:22:13,237 --> 00:22:15,762
Where  am  l  going?
Where  am  l  going?
