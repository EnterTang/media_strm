1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,003
Yeah    yeah    yeah.
Hold  on    let  me  speak    OK?

2
00:00:05,003 --> 00:00:08,039
Listen    look  
you  bozos  asked  me…

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,041
if  l  wanted  to  increase
my credit  limit

4
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:11,943
l  mean    what the  hell
was  l  gonna  say?  No?

5
00:00:11,943 --> 00:00:14,112
Yeah    well  
how  was  l  supposed  to  know…

6
00:00:14,112 --> 00:00:15,447
l  was  gonna  get  laid  off?

7
00:00:15,447 --> 00:00:17,515
No    listen    l  don't  know－－

8
00:00:17,515 --> 00:00:20,251
l  don't  need  you  tellin'  me
how  much  l  owe    OK?

9
00:00:20,251 --> 00:00:22,721
What do you  want to  know?
How  much  l  owe  my ex－girlfriend?

10
00:00:22,721 --> 00:00:24,780
Or the three  grand
l  owe  my  brother?

11
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:29,127
No    no    you  can't cancel
my credit card!

12
00:00:29,127 --> 00:00:30,628
l  got  bills  up the yin-yang!

13
00:00:30,628 --> 00:00:32,897
Yeah    well  
sorry doesn't cut  it    pal!

14
00:00:32,897 --> 00:00:33,921
Uhh!

15
00:00:52,817 --> 00:00:54,486
Yeah?

16
00:00:54,486 --> 00:00:55,510
Hello    Vince

17
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:59,657
Do  l  know you?

18
00:00:59,657 --> 00:01:02,393
l'm  Muriel.  This  is  Michael.
May we  come  in?

19
00:01:02,393 --> 00:01:04,329
Look    if you're
sellin'  somethin'    l'm－－

20
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:05,663
We're  not selling  anything

21
00:01:05,663 --> 00:01:07,165
Good.  'cause  l  don't
have  any  money

22
00:01:07,165 --> 00:01:08,792
You've  been  chosen

23
00:01:10,335 --> 00:01:11,603
For  what?

24
00:01:11,603 --> 00:01:14,172
We're  here to  offer you  a  chance
at a  whole  new  life

25
00:01:14,172 --> 00:01:16,174
Ha  ha.  l  knew  it.  Good－bye

26
00:01:16,174 --> 00:01:18,676
You're  not  listening    Vince.
You've  been  chosen

27
00:01:18,676 --> 00:01:20,578
l'd  hate to  see those
pretty  little fingers…

28
00:01:20,578 --> 00:01:21,746
get smashed  in  my door    OK?

29
00:01:21,746 --> 00:01:23,714
We're  here to  help you

30
00:01:28,486 --> 00:01:31,222
Look    you  wanna  help  me?
l  need  a  job

31
00:01:31,222 --> 00:01:33,191
l  could  use  some  money
in  my  pocket

32
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:34,592
And  while you're  at  it…

33
00:01:34,592 --> 00:01:36,694
why don't you  help  me
get  my girlfriend  back?

34
00:01:36,694 --> 00:01:39,130
What we're  offering  you  is
a  little  bit  more  substantial

35
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,599
And  what  l'm  offering  you
is  a  chance to  get  lost…

36
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:43,601
before  l  come  out there
and  kick your  ass

37
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:45,501
l'm  gonna  count to three

38
00:01:47,205 --> 00:01:48,502
One…

39
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:52,403
two…

40
00:01:56,147 --> 00:01:57,215
What's this?

41
00:01:57,215 --> 00:01:58,273
lt's  a  gift

42
00:02:03,755 --> 00:02:06,558
Yeah    well    whatever  it  is  
l'm…not  buyin'

43
00:02:06,558 --> 00:02:07,616
Don't  be  so  sure    Vince

44
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,352
Hey there    Vince

45
00:02:34,352 --> 00:02:37,922
Now    we  know you've  had  some
disappointments  recently

46
00:02:37,922 --> 00:02:39,190
l  guess  lookin'  back
on  your  life…

47
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,892
there's  not  much
to  be  proud  of－－

48
00:02:40,892 --> 00:02:43,895
problem  kid    barely  made  it
through  high  school…

49
00:02:43,895 --> 00:02:46,931
petty thefts    all  those  DUls

50
00:02:46,931 --> 00:02:48,899
ls  it any wonder
that  Lea  dumped  you?

51
00:02:51,536 --> 00:02:52,804
But you  don't  need  me
to  remind  you…

52
00:02:52,804 --> 00:02:54,839
that failure  sticks to you
like  gum  on  a  shoe

53
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:57,141
l  don't  need  to  listen  to this

54
00:02:57,141 --> 00:02:59,344
But you  and  l  both  know
there's  more to  Vince  Hansen…

55
00:02:59,344 --> 00:03:01,112
than  the  record  shows

56
00:03:01,112 --> 00:03:06,784
There's  something  inside you  
Vince    something  worth  rescuing

57
00:03:06,784 --> 00:03:10,054
That's  why
you've  been  contacted

58
00:03:10,054 --> 00:03:13,024
That's  why you've  been  chosen

59
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,891
We'll  be  back for you  soon

60
00:03:21,132 --> 00:03:22,367
That's  a  sales  pitch…

61
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:24,402
Vince  Hansen  doesn't  hear
every day

62
00:03:24,402 --> 00:03:27,772
But what exactly
did  they  mean  by chosen?

63
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:29,107
ln  the  Twilight Zone…

64
00:03:29,107 --> 00:03:31,276
Vince  is  about
to find  out the  answer…

65
00:03:31,276 --> 00:03:34,211
whether  he  wants to…
or  not

66
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,440
Wha…

67
00:03:38,683 --> 00:03:42,186
You're traveling
to  another  dimension－－

68
00:03:42,186 --> 00:03:46,090
a  dimension  not only
of sight and  sound…

69
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,785
but of  mind

70
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,530
A journey
into  a  wondrous  land…

71
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,330
whose  boundaries  are  only that
of the  imagination

72
00:03:59,437 --> 00:04:01,029
You're  entering…

73
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,018
lf you  do  drive
the  Ahman  freeway…

74
00:04:14,018 --> 00:04:15,883
it's jammin'  up from  Avenue  50
all  the  way  into  down－－

75
00:04:16,955 --> 00:04:18,690
Hey    hey    red

76
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,293
Hey.  How's  it  hangin'?

77
00:04:22,293 --> 00:04:24,095
To the  left

78
00:04:24,095 --> 00:04:26,664
Not that  it does  me  any good
in  this  wheelchair

79
00:04:26,664 --> 00:04:29,000
What do you  got for  me    slick?

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,868
The  essentials.  What else?

81
00:04:30,868 --> 00:04:32,670
lt's  up to  sixty  million

82
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,228
Feelin'  lucky today

83
00:04:37,608 --> 00:04:40,445
Ah    mmm.
Nighttime  reading

84
00:04:40,445 --> 00:04:42,276
-Just what  l  like.
－Heh  heh

85
00:04:44,682 --> 00:04:46,985
Tuna  fish  again?
What am  l    a  cat?

86
00:04:46,985 --> 00:04:48,619
lt's  healthy

87
00:04:48,619 --> 00:04:49,954
Come  on

88
00:04:49,954 --> 00:04:51,581
All  right.  Hmm

89
00:04:53,157 --> 00:04:54,559
What do  l  owe you    kiddo?

90
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:56,254
A  can  of  brew
will  call  us  even

91
00:04:57,895 --> 00:05:00,557
You're  a  good  neighbor.
You  know that?

92
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:04,031
－Drop  dead.
-You  first

93
00:05:09,173 --> 00:05:13,177
So…how's
the job  search  comin'?

94
00:05:13,177 --> 00:05:16,848
Ah    well    l'm  supposed  to  see
Doyle this  afternoon

95
00:05:16,848 --> 00:05:19,484
He  says  he  may  have  somethin'
lined  up for  me  at the  shop

96
00:05:19,484 --> 00:05:21,486
Doyle?  Doyle's  a  surly  bastard

97
00:05:21,486 --> 00:05:23,087
Yeah.  Well    so  are you

98
00:05:23,087 --> 00:05:24,922
That's your  problem    man

99
00:05:24,922 --> 00:05:27,117
You  hang  out with
the  wrong  kind  of  people

100
00:05:29,293 --> 00:05:31,162
Damn    are they still  around?

101
00:05:31,162 --> 00:05:32,493
You  mean  Michael  and  Muriel?

102
00:05:33,698 --> 00:05:35,433
“  Gimme that
old  time  religion  ”

103
00:05:35,433 --> 00:05:37,935
“  Gimme that
old  time  religion  ”

104
00:05:37,935 --> 00:05:39,737
“  Gimme that
old  time  religion  ”

105
00:05:39,737 --> 00:05:41,105
They come  knockin'  here    too?

106
00:05:41,105 --> 00:05:42,732
“  lt's  good  enough  for  me  ”

107
00:05:44,175 --> 00:05:46,010
They're freakin'  wackos

108
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,945
They even  left  me
some  video to  watch

109
00:05:47,945 --> 00:05:49,680
Had  my  name  engraved
on  it and  everything

110
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,550
Yeah    they  left  me  a  DVD

111
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,252
Oh    yeah?

112
00:05:54,252 --> 00:05:55,583
Did  you  watch  it?

113
00:05:57,021 --> 00:05:59,624
Why the  hell  would  l  watch  it?

114
00:05:59,624 --> 00:06:01,225
Yeah

115
00:06:01,225 --> 00:06:02,727
l  don't  know    it's  weird

116
00:06:02,727 --> 00:06:04,595
Mine－－mine    uh    it－－it…

117
00:06:04,595 --> 00:06:07,131
－had  all  this  stuff on  it.
－What  kind  of stuff?

118
00:06:07,131 --> 00:06:09,500
l  don't  know.  Like    uh  
you  know    like    personal  stuff

119
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,472
Like  my  life  and    uh…my  past.
They even  knew  about  Lea

120
00:06:14,472 --> 00:06:15,873
Get  used  to  it    buddy

121
00:06:15,873 --> 00:06:18,109
This  is  what  happens
when  this  old  time  religion…

122
00:06:18,109 --> 00:06:20,878
meets the  information
superhighway

123
00:06:20,878 --> 00:06:23,540
You  can't  keep  nothin'
a  secret  no  more

124
00:06:25,283 --> 00:06:28,013
Yeah.  What can  we  do    you  know?

125
00:06:37,028 --> 00:06:40,531
We  can  have  another  beer.
That's  what we're  gonna  do

126
00:06:40,531 --> 00:06:41,793
That's  good  enough  for  me

127
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:47,004
What do you  mean  
there's  no job?

128
00:06:47,004 --> 00:06:48,840
You  told  me there's  work  here

129
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,875
l  was  being  optimistic

130
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,777
What the  hell  good
does that do  me?

131
00:06:52,777 --> 00:06:55,947
Well    l'm  sorry about that

132
00:06:55,947 --> 00:06:58,583
What    l  can't  have  a  lousy fry?

133
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,643
May  l  remind  you?
Things  are tough  all  over

134
00:07:02,987 --> 00:07:04,322
Yeah    but you're
the  one  sittin' there…

135
00:07:04,322 --> 00:07:06,157
with  all  the  French  fries

136
00:07:06,157 --> 00:07:07,749
And  they're  good    too

137
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,861
Do  me  a  favor?

138
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:11,556
Let  me finish  my  lunch
in  peace

139
00:07:13,898 --> 00:07:15,388
Thank you

140
00:07:37,155 --> 00:07:38,623
They're  among  us

141
00:07:38,623 --> 00:07:41,826
They  may  look  normal
like you  or  me…

142
00:07:41,826 --> 00:07:43,728
but don't  let that fool  you

143
00:07:43,728 --> 00:07:49,066
They  may  look  like  missionaries  
but they're  aliens

144
00:07:49,066 --> 00:07:50,735
They're  gonna  wipe  us  out

145
00:07:50,735 --> 00:07:52,904
We  have to  stop them

146
00:07:52,904 --> 00:07:55,339
They've  locked  out
our  satellites

147
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:57,807
Now  we  can't see their  ships

148
00:07:59,177 --> 00:08:01,279
And  now they're  here

149
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,115
They're  gonna  take  us
back to their  planet…

150
00:08:04,115 --> 00:08:05,707
turn  us  all  into  slaves

151
00:08:07,585 --> 00:08:08,711
Would  you  get  lost?

152
00:08:10,922 --> 00:08:12,890
God    save  us from  them

153
00:08:14,992 --> 00:08:16,594
The  sudden  failure…

154
00:08:16,594 --> 00:08:20,097
of the  Global  Satellite  Network
has  increased  world  tension

155
00:08:20,097 --> 00:08:21,999
We're  approximately
fifteen  minutes  away…

156
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:23,701
from  the  start
of an  emergency session…

157
00:08:23,701 --> 00:08:26,003
of the  U.N.  Security Council

158
00:08:26,003 --> 00:08:28,506
And  the  latest opinion  polls
show the  american  public…

159
00:08:28,506 --> 00:08:30,541
Turn  this  crap  off    would  ya?

160
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,109
l'm  depressed  enough  as  it  is

161
00:08:32,109 --> 00:08:33,778
What the  hell
are you  doin'  here?

162
00:08:33,778 --> 00:08:36,047
lt's  nice
to  see you    too    Gordo

163
00:08:36,047 --> 00:08:38,916
l'll  have  a  vodka  tonic  
hold  the tonic

164
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,685
Have  it someplace  else

165
00:08:40,685 --> 00:08:42,553
You  forgettin'    man?
You're  barred  from  here

166
00:08:42,553 --> 00:08:43,788
ls  Lea  around?

167
00:08:43,788 --> 00:08:45,356
Heh

168
00:08:45,356 --> 00:08:48,559
You're  a  regular  glutton
for  punishment    aren't ya?

169
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,891
l'm  a  romantic    is  what  l  am

170
00:08:52,196 --> 00:08:53,595
Here you  go

171
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:59,670
Just when  l  thought
it was  gonna  be  a  nice  day

172
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,073
l'm  not  loanin' you  any  money

173
00:09:02,073 --> 00:09:05,474
Well    that's  good    'cause
l'm  not  here to  borrow  any

174
00:09:07,144 --> 00:09:09,947
lt's  awful  lonely
out there  without you

175
00:09:09,947 --> 00:09:13,884
Well    try gettin'  a  job.
Maybe you  won't  be  so  lonely

176
00:09:13,884 --> 00:09:15,886
Look    l'm  tryin'.  l'm  tryin'

177
00:09:15,886 --> 00:09:18,089
l  don't  understand
how you're  able…

178
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:21,959
to just go  on  with  your  life
like  l  never  existed

179
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,161
You  just don't get  it    do you?

180
00:09:24,161 --> 00:09:26,163
Well    maybe  l'm  not
as  smart as you  are

181
00:09:26,163 --> 00:09:28,893
No  argument there

182
00:09:31,869 --> 00:09:36,507
Vince    l  want to  make  something
of  my  life    you  know?

183
00:09:36,507 --> 00:09:38,975
l  don't want to  waste  it
hangin'  out and  partying

184
00:09:40,778 --> 00:09:42,803
lt's time to  grow  up

185
00:09:44,348 --> 00:09:46,984
Does  any of this
ring  a  bell?

186
00:09:46,984 --> 00:09:50,288
Baby…l  love you

187
00:09:50,288 --> 00:09:53,291
And  l  love you    OK?
lt's just…

188
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,126
that's  not enough  anymore

189
00:09:55,126 --> 00:09:56,394
Y-you  don't  mean  that

190
00:09:56,394 --> 00:09:57,561
Vince    you're  not  listening  
all  right?

191
00:09:57,561 --> 00:09:59,463
That's  why you  never
get the  message

192
00:09:59,463 --> 00:10:00,898
Lea    you  gotta  give  me
another  chance  here    OK?

193
00:10:00,898 --> 00:10:02,099
Just  let  me  explain

194
00:10:02,099 --> 00:10:04,035
There's  nothin'
to  explain    man

195
00:10:04,035 --> 00:10:06,671
Stay out of this    Gordo.
lt's  got  nothin' to  do  with  you

196
00:10:06,671 --> 00:10:08,939
You  know    you're  right?
He  never  gets the  message

197
00:10:08,939 --> 00:10:12,170
－Hey    don't  hurt  him!
－Too  late

198
00:10:16,147 --> 00:10:17,910
Ohhh…uhh…

199
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,358
Have you  watched
the  DVD yet    Vince?

200
00:10:34,665 --> 00:10:37,568
Who  are you  freaks?
What do you  want from  me?

201
00:10:37,568 --> 00:10:40,304
We're  here to  help you

202
00:10:40,304 --> 00:10:42,173
Help  someone  else

203
00:10:42,173 --> 00:10:43,374
Time  is  running  out

204
00:10:43,374 --> 00:10:44,809
l  don't care!  Leave  me  alone!

205
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:46,577
You  don't want that    Vince!

206
00:10:46,577 --> 00:10:48,943
You've  been  chosen!

207
00:11:07,298 --> 00:11:09,061
Hey    neighbor!

208
00:11:13,938 --> 00:11:15,873
Turning  from
the faltering  negotiations…

209
00:11:15,873 --> 00:11:18,142
at the  United  Nations
to  local  news…

210
00:11:18,142 --> 00:11:21,312
police  are  issuing  an  appeal
for  anyone  with  information…

211
00:11:21,312 --> 00:11:24,338
about the  disappearance
of Wendy  Robins to  come－－

212
00:11:38,462 --> 00:11:39,451
No freakin'  way

213
00:11:40,698 --> 00:11:41,687
Speed!

214
00:11:51,475 --> 00:11:52,840
Speed!

215
00:11:57,615 --> 00:11:59,105
Speed?

216
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:01,907
Uhh

217
00:12:28,846 --> 00:12:31,246
'Cause there's  somethin'
inside you    Speed

218
00:12:33,451 --> 00:12:34,985
Something  worth  rescuing

219
00:12:34,985 --> 00:12:37,188
That's  why
you've  been  contacted

220
00:12:37,188 --> 00:12:38,923
That's  why you've  been  chosen

221
00:12:38,923 --> 00:12:42,324
We'll  be  back for you  soon

222
00:12:45,996 --> 00:12:48,666
l'm  telling  you    Speed
couldn't  have  gone  anywhere…

223
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,801
without  his  chair.
The  guy can't walk

224
00:12:50,801 --> 00:12:53,003
Then  where  could  he  be  
Mr.  Hansen?

225
00:12:53,003 --> 00:12:55,339
Beats the  hell  out of  me

226
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:56,340
Who  are you?

227
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,210
Richard  Schultz  
Homeland  Security

228
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:02,379
lf  l  could  have  everybody
step  outside    please

229
00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:03,380
Why?

230
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,041
Right this  way    Mr.  Hansen

231
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:14,391
Do you  know  if Mr.  Moorcock
had  any visitors  lately?

232
00:13:14,391 --> 00:13:16,093
Uh    yeah.  Yeah

233
00:13:16,093 --> 00:13:18,462
l  was just tellin'
the  officers  inside

234
00:13:18,462 --> 00:13:22,399
Uh…Michael  and－－and  Muriel

235
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,201
At  least    that's  what
they called  themselves

236
00:13:24,201 --> 00:13:25,903
They're  some  kind  of
religious  nuts    l  think

237
00:13:25,903 --> 00:13:28,005
Were you  visited
by them  as  well?

238
00:13:28,005 --> 00:13:29,640
Well    yeah    they  hit
the  whole  neighborhood

239
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,742
There's  more  of 'em
out there    too

240
00:13:31,742 --> 00:13:33,477
Who  are these  people?

241
00:13:33,477 --> 00:13:35,312
And  what would  they want
with  a  guy  like  Speed?

242
00:13:35,312 --> 00:13:38,449
Mr.  Hansen  
l'd  be  extremely careful…

243
00:13:38,449 --> 00:13:40,246
who  l  let  in  my  home  
if  l  were you

244
00:13:42,853 --> 00:13:44,889
Heh.  What are you  sayin'…

245
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:46,991
they're  gonna  try
and  disappear  me    too?

246
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:49,593
There's  a  pattern  forming

247
00:13:49,593 --> 00:13:51,562
So  Speed  wasn't the first

248
00:13:51,562 --> 00:13:53,223
There's  been  others?  How  many?

249
00:13:55,332 --> 00:13:58,631
You  call  me  if you  see  Michael  
Muriel    or  any of their friends

250
00:14:03,073 --> 00:14:06,143
Wait    wait    wait.
Just  between  you  and  me

251
00:14:06,143 --> 00:14:09,547
Are－－are  we talkin'
aliens  here?

252
00:14:09,547 --> 00:14:12,107
You  have  my  number

253
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:25,362
Diplomats  at the  United  Nations
Security Council…

254
00:14:25,362 --> 00:14:26,830
have traded  threats…

255
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:30,134
over the failure  of
the  Global  Satellite  Network

256
00:14:30,134 --> 00:14:32,903
ln  other  news  
the  mysterious  wave…

257
00:14:32,903 --> 00:14:34,738
of  missing  persons
around  the  world…

258
00:14:34,738 --> 00:14:37,207
has  baffled  the  international
scientific－－

259
00:14:37,207 --> 00:14:38,809
Look    Lea    l  didn't come
to  make trouble

260
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:40,470
l  just want to  warn  you－－

261
00:14:41,845 --> 00:14:44,081
l've  been  tryin' to  call  you

262
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:46,784
Oh…that's  great

263
00:14:46,784 --> 00:14:49,053
Um    listen    there's  somethin'
you  need  to  know

264
00:14:49,053 --> 00:14:52,614
l'm  not exactly sure  
but  l  think  we're  all  in  danger

265
00:14:53,991 --> 00:14:55,626
Where  is  everyone?

266
00:14:55,626 --> 00:14:58,789
Didn't you  see the  sign?
We're  closed

267
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,333
Listen    you  don't  know
what's  been  goin'  on

268
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,500
People  have  been  disappearing

269
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,802
Oh    Vince

270
00:15:04,802 --> 00:15:06,236
No    it's true.
You  gotta  come  home  with  me

271
00:15:06,236 --> 00:15:08,606
We'll  lock  ourselves  in    and  if
anyone  we  don't  know  comes  by－－

272
00:15:08,606 --> 00:15:10,307
Vince    can  l  please
say something?

273
00:15:10,307 --> 00:15:12,036
What?

274
00:15:14,378 --> 00:15:16,573
l  just feel  so  much  love
for you  right  now

275
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:20,517
l  just…

276
00:15:20,517 --> 00:15:23,020
l  want  us to  be
together…forever

277
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,755
And  we  will

278
00:15:24,755 --> 00:15:27,224
And  l'll  do  a  lot  better  
l  promise

279
00:15:27,224 --> 00:15:29,317
-You  mean  that?
－Oh    you  know  l  do

280
00:15:30,527 --> 00:15:33,826
Well    you  could  start
by watching  the  DVD

281
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:36,867
What  DVD?

282
00:15:36,867 --> 00:15:39,470
The  DVD that Muriel
and  Michael  left you

283
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,105
Lea－－

284
00:15:41,105 --> 00:15:43,505
We've  been  chosen

285
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,043
OK    Lea    listen  to  me

286
00:15:46,043 --> 00:15:47,378
There's  no  need
to  be frightened

287
00:15:47,378 --> 00:15:48,545
We  can  still  get away

288
00:15:48,545 --> 00:15:49,880
Don't  be  silly

289
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,482
They're  waiting  for  us

290
00:15:51,482 --> 00:15:52,650
l'm  supposed
to take you  to them

291
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:53,884
Oh    my God

292
00:15:53,884 --> 00:15:55,285
They've  already turned  you
into  one  of them

293
00:15:55,285 --> 00:15:58,489
Vince    you  still  want
to  be  with  me    right?

294
00:15:58,489 --> 00:16:00,924
Well    we  can  be together

295
00:16:00,924 --> 00:16:02,858
lsn't that what you  want?

296
00:16:12,636 --> 00:16:13,804
l  owe you

297
00:16:13,804 --> 00:16:16,807
Hey    hold  on  a  second.
The  least you  can  do…

298
00:16:16,807 --> 00:16:18,776
is tell  me
what you  need  it for

299
00:16:18,776 --> 00:16:21,370
What  if  l  told  you  Speed
was  vaporized  by aliens?

300
00:16:47,838 --> 00:16:49,707
American  lntelligence  Services
report…

301
00:16:49,707 --> 00:16:52,910
that    for the first time  since
the fall  of the  Eastern  Bloc…

302
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,678
every  nation
with  nuclear  weapons…

303
00:16:54,678 --> 00:16:56,880
is  at their  highest state
of  readiness for  war

304
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,349
The  president will  be  addressing
the  nation  tonight…

305
00:16:59,349 --> 00:17:02,250
to  call  for  calm  in  the face
of this  growing  crisis

306
00:17:34,084 --> 00:17:35,886
Come  on

307
00:17:35,886 --> 00:17:37,615
Oh    come  on    come  on!

308
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,855
Go  away!

309
00:17:50,968 --> 00:17:52,595
l  mean  it!

310
00:18:02,379 --> 00:18:03,539
Vince!

311
00:18:05,315 --> 00:18:06,304
Uhh!

312
00:18:13,524 --> 00:18:15,958
You  shouldn't  have  done that

313
00:18:55,232 --> 00:18:57,401
l'm  sorry    Vince.
lt's  clear  now…

314
00:18:57,401 --> 00:18:59,767
you  were  never  meant
to  be  chosen

315
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,212
Bye    Vince

316
00:19:08,212 --> 00:19:09,746
l  really did  love you

317
00:19:09,746 --> 00:19:12,583
l  came  back for you    buddy

318
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:15,313
Sorry you  won't
be  with  us    man

319
00:20:12,042 --> 00:20:14,602
ln  a  world  about to  end…

320
00:20:16,013 --> 00:20:18,882
Vince  Hansen  was  given
a  chance for  salvation

321
00:20:18,882 --> 00:20:23,253
But  leave  it to  Vince－－
one  of  life's  perpetual  losers－－

322
00:20:23,253 --> 00:20:26,223
to  make the  wrong  choice…

323
00:20:26,223 --> 00:20:28,225
and  to  wind  up
just another  cinder…

324
00:20:28,225 --> 00:20:31,490
on  an  ash  heap  somewhere
in  the  Twilight Zone
