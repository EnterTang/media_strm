Hold  on    he just walked  in

00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,976
There you  are.  Sound  magazine

4
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,500
lt's the third  time
they've  called

5
00:00:42,545 --> 00:00:43,671
Where you  goin'?

6
00:00:43,713 --> 00:00:45,544
Dress  shopping
for the  party tonight

7
00:00:45,582 --> 00:00:47,573
Whoa    whoa    whoa  
whoa    whoa    whoa

8
00:00:47,617 --> 00:00:49,448
You  look too  good
just to  run  out on  me

9
00:00:51,254 --> 00:00:53,916
-You're  all  sweaty.
－That's  OK    that's  OK

10
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:58,583
Come  on    now.
6:45    the  limo  will  be  here

11
00:00:58,628 --> 00:00:59,754
Do  not forget

12
00:00:59,796 --> 00:01:01,229
－l  won't forget.
－All  right

13
00:01:03,566 --> 00:01:06,433
Yo    this  is  Marvin  Gardens  
man    speak

14
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:08,369
What  up?  lt's  Darnell  Walker

15
00:01:08,404 --> 00:01:09,666
We're  doing
our  annual  top ten  list…

16
00:01:09,706 --> 00:01:11,901
for  most  influential
hip－hop  artists

17
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:13,932
Just wanted  to  check  some facts  
if you  got a  minute

18
00:01:13,977 --> 00:01:16,810
OK    so    where  do  l  rank
this year?

19
00:01:16,846 --> 00:01:19,178
Number three.
You're  up two  places

20
00:01:19,215 --> 00:01:21,046
l've  heard  so  many stories  
dawg

21
00:01:21,084 --> 00:01:23,348
How  did  you  really choose
your  name?

22
00:01:23,386 --> 00:01:26,651
Well    it went down
like this    man－－

23
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:28,680
as  a  kid    l  loved  Monopoly

24
00:01:28,725 --> 00:01:30,750
Everybody  loved  it  
you  know  what  l'm  sayin'?

25
00:01:30,793 --> 00:01:31,953
My family  
we  played  it all  the time…

26
00:01:31,995 --> 00:01:33,462
and  everybody wanted
Boardwalk…

27
00:01:33,496 --> 00:01:35,191
and  everybody wanted
Park  Place…

28
00:01:35,231 --> 00:01:38,200
but  me  
l  loved  Marvin  Gardens…

29
00:01:38,234 --> 00:01:40,031
because  Marvin  Gardens
was  a  sleeper…

30
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:42,128
it was
a  primo  piece  of  property

31
00:01:42,172 --> 00:01:43,298
lt was the  best spot
on  the  board  to  me

32
00:01:43,339 --> 00:01:44,465
You  know  what  l'm  talkin'  'bout?

33
00:01:44,507 --> 00:01:46,805
And  who  always  got they  hotel
first  but  me?

34
00:01:46,843 --> 00:01:47,969
So that's  how  l  got  my  name

35
00:01:48,011 --> 00:01:49,273
Well    is there  anything
to that  rumor…

36
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:52,304
that your  label  rejected
your first tape you  delivered?

37
00:01:52,348 --> 00:01:54,407
Hell    no!  Ain't  noth－－

38
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,077
Listen  
that's  exactly what  it  is    man

39
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:57,086
lt's  a  rumor  
you  know  what  l'm  sayin'?

40
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,247
l  mean    listen    they ain't even
heard  the  record  yet…

41
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:02,053
and  when  they  hear the  record  
they gonna  be  kissin'  my feet!

42
00:02:02,091 --> 00:02:03,251
You  understand  that?
Look    listen

43
00:02:03,293 --> 00:02:06,319
l  got Chuck  Amok  on  the track  
l  got  Lil' Jolly on  the track…

44
00:02:06,362 --> 00:02:09,923
l  got  Kid  Bang  on  the track.
This  record  is  a  monster!

45
00:02:09,966 --> 00:02:11,900
Oh    man  
that's  gonna  be  off the  hook!

46
00:02:11,935 --> 00:02:13,232
Hey    yo    l  know you're  busy

47
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:15,203
Just one  more  question

48
00:02:15,238 --> 00:02:19,766
lf you  lost  it all  right  now  
what would  you  do?

49
00:02:19,809 --> 00:02:21,777
l'd  probably  play
a  whole  lot  more  video  games…

50
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:24,211
you  know  what  l  mean?
Ha  ha  ha  ha  ha

51
00:02:24,247 --> 00:02:25,373
No  doubt about  it

52
00:02:25,415 --> 00:02:27,144
But  listen    man  
holler  at  me  later    OK?

53
00:02:27,183 --> 00:02:28,650
You  got  it.
Hey    thanks for your time

54
00:02:28,685 --> 00:02:30,152
OK    Darnell.  Peace

55
00:02:30,186 --> 00:02:32,450
We  shall  wait  here
until  the  part－－

56
00:02:32,488 --> 00:02:35,116
That's  a  good  job    man.
OK    but what you  need－－

57
00:02:35,158 --> 00:02:40,152
Uh－huh.
Hit the  red.  Hit the  red

58
00:02:41,531 --> 00:02:43,362
Boom!  Oh!

59
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:44,798
Good  job    man

60
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:46,995
You  know  we  got youth  basketball
in  an  hour    though    right?

61
00:02:47,036 --> 00:02:49,027
－Uh－huh.
－Good    good    good

62
00:02:49,072 --> 00:02:50,232
Ten  more  minutes  on  this    OK?

63
00:02:58,915 --> 00:03:00,974
When  you're  at the top  of
your  game  like  Marvin  Gardens…

64
00:03:01,017 --> 00:03:03,383
the  only thing  left to  conquer
is fear－－

65
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:06,047
fear that your  success
won't  last…

66
00:03:06,089 --> 00:03:07,613
that  maybe    just  maybe…

67
00:03:07,657 --> 00:03:10,956
You  might fall  back  into
a  life you  once  escaped

68
00:03:22,472 --> 00:03:24,531
Lighten  up.
You  trying  to  kill  him?

69
00:03:24,574 --> 00:03:27,134
lt's  what this  scumbag  deserves

70
00:03:27,176 --> 00:03:28,336
All  right.  That's  enough

71
00:03:32,782 --> 00:03:35,250
l'm  sure you  can  appreciate
the  officer's  passion

72
00:03:35,285 --> 00:03:38,186
You  capped  his  partner.
That's  like  killing  family

73
00:03:38,221 --> 00:03:42,749
What are you  talking  about?
l'm  not a  cop  killer

74
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:45,420
No?  Well    right  now  
you're the  only suspect we  got

75
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:47,691
Yeah

76
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:09,441
You  are traveling to  another  dimension...

77
00:04:09,485 --> 00:04:15,448
a  dimension not only of sight and  sound...
but of  mind...

79
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:24,765
A journey into a wondrous land
whose boundaries are only that of the imagination

81
00:04:27,203 --> 00:04:34,296
You're  entering…

82
00:04:36,245 --> 00:04:38,611
So  l'm  in  Barney's…

83
00:04:38,648 --> 00:04:40,616
and  they got these
new  pants for  white  girls…

84
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,277
with  padding  sewn  into the tush

85
00:04:42,318 --> 00:04:43,546
Can  you  believe  it?

86
00:04:47,223 --> 00:04:48,554
l'm  trying  to  burn  it off…

87
00:04:48,591 --> 00:04:51,355
and  they're  paying  extra
to  put  it on

88
00:04:55,531 --> 00:04:58,466
You  had  another  one
of those  visions    didn't you?

89
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,002
Marvin    you've  been
having  these for  weeks  now

90
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,233
Look    it's  nothin'

91
00:05:04,273 --> 00:05:06,571
lt's just  pressure
from  making  this  record

92
00:05:06,609 --> 00:05:07,940
You  mind
if we  stay  home tonight?

93
00:05:07,977 --> 00:05:10,104
Whatever

94
00:05:11,647 --> 00:05:14,377
But  l  really think…

95
00:05:14,417 --> 00:05:16,009
that you  should  see
a  psychiatrist

96
00:05:16,052 --> 00:05:19,351
l  am  not seeing  a  shrink!
Don't ask  me to

97
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:21,254
l  did  all  this  on  my own

98
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,485
l  don't  need  people thinkin'
that  l  can't  keep  it together

99
00:05:23,526 --> 00:05:25,756
You  think you're  gonna  lose
your  street cred?  ls that  it?

100
00:05:29,365 --> 00:05:30,923
Baby    listen

101
00:05:33,403 --> 00:05:36,429
lt's  not your  image
that  people  love

102
00:05:36,472 --> 00:05:40,465
lt's your  music.  lt's your  soul

103
00:05:44,547 --> 00:05:46,606
Marvin    l  love you…

104
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:49,777
and  it  kills  me
to  see you  suffer  like this

105
00:05:52,355 --> 00:05:55,051
All  right?  You  hear  me?

106
00:05:55,091 --> 00:05:58,686
OK    then  smile

107
00:05:58,728 --> 00:06:00,218
Did  you  hit this today?
lt's  on

108
00:06:00,263 --> 00:06:01,560
Hey    let's  make  it  happen

109
00:06:01,597 --> 00:06:03,121
Yo    yo    yo    yo    what's  up    baby?

110
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:06,294
－What's  up    man?
－Chuck    what's  happenin'    man?

111
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,734
l'm  all  right.  l'm  workin'

112
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,204
You  ready to  hit this?
Let's  do the  chorus    man

113
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:12,707
－Hey    let's  do  it.  Let's  go.
－Let's  make  it  happen

114
00:06:12,742 --> 00:06:14,903
－Hey    yo    roll  it    man.
－“  l  can't  help  it…  ”

115
00:06:14,944 --> 00:06:16,912
－All  right    here  we  go.
－“ Just give  me…  ”

116
00:06:16,946 --> 00:06:18,106
Then  go  like this

117
00:06:18,147 --> 00:06:20,843
“  When  l  die  l  wanna  be  high  ”

118
00:06:20,883 --> 00:06:22,544
“  Never  worry    just  bury  me  ”

119
00:06:22,585 --> 00:06:24,177
“  Along  with  my currency ”

120
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,188
“  When  l  die  l  wanna  be  high  ”

121
00:06:26,222 --> 00:06:28,349
“  Never  worry    just  bury  me  ”

122
00:06:28,391 --> 00:06:30,586
－Got that?
－l  got  it.  l  got  it

123
00:06:30,626 --> 00:06:33,288
Hey    yo    yo    yo    yo  
roll  it again    roll  it again

124
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:36,093
－“  l  can't  help  it ”
－OK    so this time…

125
00:06:36,132 --> 00:06:38,225
Five    six    seven…

126
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:40,326
“  When  l  die  l  wanna  be  high  ”

127
00:06:40,369 --> 00:06:42,132
“  Never  worry    just  bury  me  ”

128
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:43,729
“  Along  with  my currency ”

129
00:06:43,773 --> 00:06:45,798
“  When  l  die  l  wanna  be  high  ”

130
00:06:45,842 --> 00:06:47,833
“  Never  worry    just  bury  me  ”

131
00:06:47,877 --> 00:06:49,208
“  Along  with  my currency ”

132
00:06:49,245 --> 00:06:51,270
“  When  l  die  l  wanna  be  high  ”

133
00:06:51,314 --> 00:06:53,305
“  Never  worry    just  bury  me  ”

134
00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:54,543
“  Along  with  my currency ”

135
00:06:55,218 --> 00:06:56,583
“  When  l  die  l  wanna  be  high  ”

136
00:06:56,619 --> 00:06:59,087
“  Never  worry    just  bury  me  ”

137
00:06:59,121 --> 00:07:01,055
“  And  that's forever    my  lord  ”

138
00:07:18,608 --> 00:07:19,734
What's  goin'  on    man?

139
00:07:19,775 --> 00:07:21,072
Driver's  license
and  registration

140
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,740
Damn    l  can't  believe this

141
00:07:25,781 --> 00:07:28,147
Well    you  better  believe  it

142
00:07:28,184 --> 00:07:30,914
We  got a  witness that saw you
running  from  the  crime  scene…

143
00:07:30,953 --> 00:07:32,386
throwing  something
into that field

144
00:07:32,421 --> 00:07:34,321
Now    we find
that something  was  a  gun…

145
00:07:34,357 --> 00:07:35,654
you're  as  good  as fried

146
00:07:35,691 --> 00:07:38,216
Unless you  come  clean  with  us

147
00:07:38,261 --> 00:07:39,558
We're talkin' to you    scumbag!

148
00:07:39,595 --> 00:07:41,790
l  don't even  know
how  l  got  here

149
00:07:41,831 --> 00:07:43,958
This  must  be  getting
very  painful  for you

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,230
How  about
you  tell  me the truth?

151
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:48,134
Maybe  l  can  help you

152
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,866
All  we're  asking  for
is your  cooperation    Dwayne

153
00:07:50,907 --> 00:07:52,568
Just tell  us  what you  know

154
00:07:52,608 --> 00:07:56,601
Dwayne?  Who you  callin'  Dwayne?
Y'all  got the  wrong  man

155
00:07:56,646 --> 00:07:58,045
Bastard's  screwin'  with  us

156
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,378
Do you  know  who  l  am?!  Do you?!

157
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,884
l'm  Marvin!  l'm  Marvin  Gardens!

158
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:05,683
Sorry.  l  didn't  recognize you

159
00:08:05,721 --> 00:08:07,382
lt's  all  right.  Damn

160
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,788
Listen    man  
what's  going  on  around  here?

161
00:08:08,824 --> 00:08:09,950
Where's the  other  cops?
What's  going  on?

162
00:08:09,992 --> 00:08:11,425
－Mr.  Gardens?
-Yes

163
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,088
Think  l  can  have
your  autograph…

164
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,461
for  my  little  sister?

165
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:20,429
Sorry about what  happened

166
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:24,303
No    no    no.  That's  OK    man.
l'm  just  havin'  a  hard  day

167
00:08:26,676 --> 00:08:27,973
Thanks

168
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,568
Apologies  again

169
00:08:29,612 --> 00:08:30,909
The  way you're  describing…

170
00:08:30,947 --> 00:08:32,437
these  shifts  in  consciousness  
Marvin…

171
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:34,415
it sounds  like
what we  call  a  fugue  state

172
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:37,647
Whatever  it  is    it ain't  real.
lt's  like  a  nightmare…

173
00:08:37,687 --> 00:08:41,817
but    you  know    like    l'm  still
awake    and  one  second    bam!

174
00:08:41,857 --> 00:08:44,257
l'm  in  this  life  
and  then  another  second…

175
00:08:44,293 --> 00:08:45,419
l'm  in    like  
a  whole  'nother  life…

176
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:48,089
and  l'm  gettin'  grilled
about shootin'  some  cop

177
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,291
You  said  these  cops
call  you  Dwayne?

178
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,927
Yeah.  Yeah.  What's  up  with  that?

179
00:08:52,969 --> 00:08:55,665
Was  it a  nickname
from  your  childhood?

180
00:08:55,705 --> 00:08:57,229
Or  an  old  friend
you  might  have forgotten  about?

181
00:08:57,273 --> 00:08:58,535
No

182
00:08:58,574 --> 00:09:01,907
You  mentioned  that
you  grew  up  in  the  projects

183
00:09:01,944 --> 00:09:04,572
－Were you  in  a  gang?
－No

184
00:09:04,614 --> 00:09:06,582
l  was  not  in  a  gang.
My  mother  would  have  killed  me

185
00:09:06,616 --> 00:09:09,176
Fair  enough

186
00:09:09,218 --> 00:09:12,346
Were you  ever  arrested?

187
00:09:12,388 --> 00:09:16,085
Or  maybe you  were  involved  with
a  crime that you  got away with

188
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,787
Look    l  don't  know  where you're
going  with  these  questions

189
00:09:18,828 --> 00:09:21,456
l'm  trying  to find
a  suppressed  memory    Marvin

190
00:09:21,497 --> 00:09:22,987
Something  from  your  past－－

191
00:09:23,032 --> 00:09:24,727
a  reason
why you  might  have  created…

192
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:27,031
this  elaborate fantasy world

193
00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:30,766
Well    l  thought fantasies  was
about good  stuff    not  bad  stuff

194
00:09:30,806 --> 00:09:32,068
Usually they are

195
00:09:33,676 --> 00:09:35,735
l'm  curious    Marvin

196
00:09:35,778 --> 00:09:38,144
You  ever fear
losing  everything  you  have?

197
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,909
And  ending  up
back  on  the  street?

198
00:09:39,949 --> 00:09:43,749
Hell    yeah.  Every damn  day.
That's  what  keeps  me  so  hungry

199
00:09:43,786 --> 00:09:45,845
l  mean    l  worked  too  hard
to  get where  l  am…

200
00:09:45,888 --> 00:09:49,415
and  l  am  never  going  back－－
never

201
00:10:01,404 --> 00:10:03,668
Junior

202
00:10:05,808 --> 00:10:07,639
Junior    it's  not funny

203
00:10:07,677 --> 00:10:09,702
Where  did  you  get this  gun  from?

204
00:10:09,745 --> 00:10:14,307
Huh?  l'm  talkin' to you!
Where  did  you  get this  gun  from?

205
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,817
Cousin  Trey  left  it  here

206
00:10:15,851 --> 00:10:17,546
l  was  gonna  give  it  back

207
00:10:24,126 --> 00:10:26,594
Man    l'm  sorry
l'm  yellin'  at you  like that…

208
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:28,927
but you  know  how  l  feel
about guns.  l  don't  like  guns

209
00:10:28,964 --> 00:10:30,556
Guns  are  not for  playing  with

210
00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:32,533
They're  very serious things  
you  understand?

211
00:10:32,568 --> 00:10:34,900
People  get  hurt with  guns
every day

212
00:10:34,937 --> 00:10:37,838
People  get  killed  with  guns
every day

213
00:10:37,873 --> 00:10:41,832
Daddy    have you  ever  seen
anybody get shot?

214
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,441
J    there's
another  world  out there…

215
00:10:46,482 --> 00:10:49,007
that  l  worked  hard
to  leave  behind

216
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:51,383
And  l  don't want guns…

217
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,787
or  any  part of that world
in  our  life  here

218
00:10:54,824 --> 00:10:57,725
－Got that?  Yeah?
－Mm－hmm

219
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,661
-You  understand  me    right?
-Yes    daddy

220
00:11:00,696 --> 00:11:03,824
-You  do?  Well    guess  what.
－What?

221
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:07,302
“  l  love you  so  much  ”

222
00:11:07,336 --> 00:11:08,963
－“  My  little  boy ”
－l  love you    daddy

223
00:11:09,004 --> 00:11:10,972
Good.  All  right

224
00:11:11,006 --> 00:11:12,473
So  it's  bedtime for you

225
00:11:12,508 --> 00:11:14,100
Here.  Make this  comfortable

226
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:17,375
Oh    yeah    right

227
00:11:17,413 --> 00:11:19,381
Get  under the  covers    man  
you  ain't funny

228
00:11:21,217 --> 00:11:23,310
Good  night    OK?  Sleep tight

229
00:11:25,354 --> 00:11:27,549
－Night.
－Night    daddy

230
00:11:34,396 --> 00:11:38,025
You  know    l'm  proud  of you

231
00:11:38,067 --> 00:11:40,558
l  didn't actually think
you'd  talk to  Dr.  Sinclair

232
00:11:40,603 --> 00:11:44,903
Well    l  can't  have
those  visions  anymore    so…

233
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,067
Marvin…

234
00:11:47,109 --> 00:11:48,974
you  worry too  much

235
00:11:49,011 --> 00:11:50,376
Oh    baby

236
00:11:50,412 --> 00:11:53,540
Yeah    l'm  a  worrier    l  guess.
You  know    it's just  my  nature

237
00:11:55,618 --> 00:11:58,485
The  doctor  gave  me  some  pills

238
00:11:58,521 --> 00:12:04,391
Said  it would  help  me focus
better  on  the  here  and  now

239
00:12:04,426 --> 00:12:08,157
－Oh    sounds  good.
-Yeah

240
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:14,100
Feels  like
they're  working  to  me

241
00:12:24,814 --> 00:12:27,442
Don't you  pass  out on  me  
you  punk!

242
00:12:27,483 --> 00:12:28,950
l'm  not through  with  you

243
00:12:28,984 --> 00:12:31,384
Your time  is  running  out  
Dwayne…

244
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,717
and  so's  my  patience

245
00:12:42,965 --> 00:12:45,661
Here.  Let  me  help you

246
00:12:51,173 --> 00:12:53,266
Jazmine?

247
00:12:59,882 --> 00:13:02,373
Here.  Drink  some  water

248
00:13:06,355 --> 00:13:09,188
Doesn't  have to  be  like this  
Dwayne

249
00:13:09,225 --> 00:13:10,988
Stop  calling  me  Dwayne

250
00:13:11,026 --> 00:13:13,221
My  name  is  Marvin－－
Marvin  Gardens

251
00:13:13,262 --> 00:13:14,593
And  l'm  Jazmine

252
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:18,293
That's  right.  You're Jazmine  
my wife  in  my  real  life

253
00:13:18,334 --> 00:13:20,894
What  real  life
are you  talking  about?

254
00:13:20,936 --> 00:13:22,096
Come  on    Jazmine

255
00:13:22,137 --> 00:13:24,469
l'm  a  millionaire.  l'm  famous.
l  live  in  a  mansion

256
00:13:24,506 --> 00:13:26,531
You  live  in  the  projects  
Dwayne…

257
00:13:26,575 --> 00:13:28,372
with  your  mother
and  your  sister

258
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,275
That's  a  lie!  That's  a  lie!

259
00:13:31,914 --> 00:13:34,815
Come  on.  You  know  how  it works

260
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,477
Good  cop/bad  cop

261
00:13:36,518 --> 00:13:38,611
Now    if you  don't
write  out a  confession…

262
00:13:38,654 --> 00:13:39,951
l  can't  help you  anymore

263
00:13:39,989 --> 00:13:42,355
Look    l'm  not gonna  confess
to  something  l  did  not do

264
00:13:42,391 --> 00:13:43,858
l'm  not a  cop  killer!

265
00:13:45,728 --> 00:13:48,629
l  really wish
l  could  believe you    Dwayne

266
00:13:48,664 --> 00:13:51,189
l  really do

267
00:13:51,233 --> 00:13:53,098
Jazmine    come  back!

268
00:13:53,135 --> 00:13:56,263
Jazmine!  Jazmine!  Don't  leave!

269
00:13:56,305 --> 00:13:58,603
-Jazmine.
－Relax    baby

270
00:13:58,641 --> 00:14:01,201
l'm  just going  to  get you
some  water.  Come  on    now

271
00:14:01,243 --> 00:14:04,940
Oh.  You  were there this time.
You  were there this time

272
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,106
What do you  mean?

273
00:14:06,148 --> 00:14:08,309
ln  my vision－－

274
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:11,046
ln  my vision    you  were there  
and  you  were  a  good  cop…

275
00:14:11,086 --> 00:14:12,747
but you  were trying
to  get  me to  confess

276
00:14:15,124 --> 00:14:16,819
And  did  you  confess?

277
00:14:16,859 --> 00:14:18,053
What you  mean    did  l  confess?

278
00:14:18,093 --> 00:14:19,685
No    l  didn't confess
'cause  l  didn't do  nothin'

279
00:14:19,728 --> 00:14:23,357
l  never  did  nothin'
in  this  life  or  no  other  life!

280
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:24,559
How  come  nobody  believes  me?

281
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,431
OK    Marvin    you're  really
starting  to  scare  me  now

282
00:14:26,468 --> 00:14:29,869
Oh    man.  l'm  sorry

283
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:35,101
Don't go.  Just…

284
00:14:35,144 --> 00:14:36,475
lt's the  record

285
00:14:36,512 --> 00:14:39,504
lt's just the  record.
l  gotta  get  it done

286
00:14:39,548 --> 00:14:41,175
l'm  gonna  finish  it tomorrow

287
00:14:41,216 --> 00:14:42,740
lt's  stressing  me  out
a  lot  right  now

288
00:14:42,785 --> 00:14:45,413
Come  back  over  here    please.
Just come  back  over  here

289
00:14:46,989 --> 00:14:49,981
lt's  gonna  be  all  right.
lt's  gonna  be  all  right

290
00:14:50,025 --> 00:14:51,151
What are you  doing?  Come  here

291
00:14:51,193 --> 00:14:53,559
l'm  gonna  finish  this  record
tomorrow…

292
00:14:53,595 --> 00:14:56,996
and    oh    just wait.  You  just
wait.  lt'll  be  all  right

293
00:14:57,032 --> 00:14:58,556
－OK.  OK.
-You  just wait and  see

294
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,033
lt's  gonna  be  all  better
tomorrow

295
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:02,560
“  Well    l  plan  to take
the  world  by  mysterious  ”

296
00:15:02,604 --> 00:15:03,866
“  That  means feelin' this  ”

297
00:15:03,906 --> 00:15:06,204
“  l  give  it a  while
before you  really  miss  ”

298
00:15:06,241 --> 00:15:08,232
“  Off your tongue  
ever  since  l  was young  ”

299
00:15:08,277 --> 00:15:10,177
“  To  act slow  
wanted  the  dough  ”

300
00:15:10,212 --> 00:15:11,338
“  Don't you  know  ”

301
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,779
“  l  rip  scenes  
and  leave  'em  bent ”

302
00:15:12,815 --> 00:15:14,646
“  From  any state  or  continent ”

303
00:15:14,683 --> 00:15:16,548
“  For  mad  dollars  and  cents  ”

304
00:15:16,585 --> 00:15:18,109
“  And  then  advance
my thoughts  ”

305
00:15:18,153 --> 00:15:20,485
“  And  l  arise    there's
a  grace  like  Arthur  Ashe  ”

306
00:15:20,522 --> 00:15:22,649
“  To  put  me  six  with  my cash  ”

307
00:15:22,691 --> 00:15:24,318
What's  up?  Y'all  feelin' that?

308
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,351
Yo    yo.
That was  off the  chain    dawg

309
00:15:26,395 --> 00:15:29,922
Yo    dawg    that was tight.
Do that verse  again    right?

310
00:15:29,965 --> 00:15:32,092
Cool    cool.  Let's  do  it again

311
00:15:32,134 --> 00:15:35,535
“  Well    l  plan  to take
the  world  by  mysterious  ”

312
00:15:35,571 --> 00:15:36,833
“  That  means feelin' this  ”

313
00:15:36,872 --> 00:15:38,863
“  l  give  it a  while
before you  really  miss  ”

314
00:15:38,907 --> 00:15:40,841
“  Off your tongue－－ ”

315
00:15:46,215 --> 00:15:47,910
What the  hell
are you  stoppin' for?

316
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:50,783
－Oh!
-Yo    he fell    man

317
00:15:53,255 --> 00:15:54,415
Marvin    what  happened?

318
00:16:00,662 --> 00:16:03,256
Damn

319
00:16:03,298 --> 00:16:05,664
l'm  telling  you    doc  
these  pills  don't work

320
00:16:05,701 --> 00:16:07,635
lt's  like they're  making
the  visions  stronger

321
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:08,863
We  could  increase the  dosage

322
00:16:08,904 --> 00:16:11,464
No!  Forget  it!
l  want a  specialist

323
00:16:11,507 --> 00:16:12,804
l  don't care  how  much  it costs

324
00:16:12,841 --> 00:16:14,866
l  want the  best shrink
that  money can  buy    you  hear  me?

325
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,378
Oh    l  hear you    all  right

326
00:16:17,413 --> 00:16:20,439
And  l'd  like to  help you…

327
00:16:20,482 --> 00:16:22,416
but you're  not giving  me
anything  here    Dwayne

328
00:16:22,451 --> 00:16:24,646
l've  given  you
every opportunity…

329
00:16:24,686 --> 00:16:26,916
to  come  clean  with  me

330
00:16:26,955 --> 00:16:30,288
But you  seem  incapable
of telling  me the truth

331
00:16:30,325 --> 00:16:33,089
This  is your  last chance  
Dwayne

332
00:16:33,128 --> 00:16:35,995
Now    either you  tell  me
that you  killed  that cop…

333
00:16:36,031 --> 00:16:37,931
or  me  and  the  detective  here  
we're  gonna  leave this  room…

334
00:16:37,966 --> 00:16:39,092
and  we're  gonna
let the  officer  here…

335
00:16:39,134 --> 00:16:42,126
finish  up the  interrogation－－
his  way

336
00:16:42,171 --> 00:16:45,038
This  ain't  happenin' to  me.
This  ain't  my  life

337
00:16:46,842 --> 00:16:49,242
Hey!
Your  life  is  gonna  be  over…

338
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:51,212
if you  don't
snap  out of  it  right  now!

339
00:16:51,246 --> 00:16:54,374
My  name  is  Marvin  Gardens  
and  l'm  no  criminal!

340
00:16:57,086 --> 00:17:00,647
Marvin    are you  OK?  You  have
had  a  real  breakthrough  here

341
00:17:00,689 --> 00:17:03,852
－l  think  we  need  to  dig  deeper.
－No    no    no    no

342
00:17:03,892 --> 00:17:06,520
We－－we  don't  need  nothin'    man

343
00:17:06,562 --> 00:17:09,429
l  don't  need  you.  l  don't  need
your  stupid  questions…

344
00:17:09,465 --> 00:17:10,432
or your  worthless  pills

345
00:17:10,466 --> 00:17:11,626
l  don't  need  any of  it.
You  know  why?

346
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:14,568
Because  l  got everything
right  here

347
00:17:14,603 --> 00:17:17,470
l  got the talent.
l  got the  will

348
00:17:17,506 --> 00:17:19,804
l  made this  life

349
00:17:19,842 --> 00:17:21,537
l  deserve this  life!

350
00:17:21,577 --> 00:17:23,477
And  nobody's
gonna  take  it from  me!

351
00:17:25,481 --> 00:17:27,039
Hey!  Hey!  Yo!

352
00:17:27,082 --> 00:17:29,550
－Hey    there you  are.
－Hi

353
00:17:29,585 --> 00:17:30,916
l  was  gettin'  worried
about you

354
00:17:30,953 --> 00:17:33,751
Oh    don't worry about  me.
Give  me  my  kiss

355
00:17:33,789 --> 00:17:35,552
That's  right

356
00:17:35,591 --> 00:17:37,286
Finishing  up  my  record

357
00:17:39,194 --> 00:17:40,320
Are you  really done?

358
00:17:40,362 --> 00:17:43,195
Yeah.  Well    actually  
l'm  just gettin'  started…

359
00:17:43,232 --> 00:17:44,597
'cause  when  the  record
come  out…

360
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:47,466
we're  gonna  be  movin'
to  a  much    much  bigger  place

361
00:17:47,503 --> 00:17:49,368
Twice  as  big  as this  one.
Really

362
00:17:49,404 --> 00:17:50,598
Did  you  hear
what  l  just told  your  mama?

363
00:17:50,639 --> 00:17:52,004
Put that down

364
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,201
Did  you  hear  what  l  just
told  your  mama    little  man?

365
00:17:54,243 --> 00:17:55,676
l  gotcha.  l  gotcha

366
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,736
Are you  ready to  celebrate
with  mama?

367
00:17:57,779 --> 00:17:59,110
Huh?  We  goin' flyin'

368
00:17:59,148 --> 00:18:01,412
We  gonna  go  crazy.  We  goin'
all  over the  place    too

369
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,645
We  goin' to  Belgium  for  waffles

370
00:18:05,988 --> 00:18:09,355
Baby    what about those  visions?

371
00:18:09,391 --> 00:18:11,518
Come  here

372
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,551
From  now  on    the  only visions
l'm  gonna  be  seein'…

373
00:18:13,595 --> 00:18:17,964
is  how fortunate  l  am  to  have
you  and  him  and  everything

374
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,831
lt don't get  no  better
than  this

375
00:18:23,238 --> 00:18:24,398
Yeah

376
00:18:36,485 --> 00:18:39,477
He's  alive  
but  his  mind  snapped

377
00:18:42,057 --> 00:18:43,922
You  went too far    Sinclair

378
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:46,154
Hey    did  what  l  had  to  do

379
00:18:49,531 --> 00:18:50,657
You're  not gonna  believe this

380
00:18:50,699 --> 00:18:51,825
Metro
just  picked  up the  shooter

381
00:18:51,867 --> 00:18:53,562
Got a  confession  and  everything

382
00:18:53,602 --> 00:18:56,867
－Dwayne's  innocent.
－Oh    man

383
00:18:56,905 --> 00:18:58,566
Get a  paramedic  in  here

384
00:19:00,776 --> 00:19:02,641
What the  hell
are you  lookin'  at  me for?

385
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:06,670
How  was  l  supposed  to  know
he  was telling  the truth?

386
00:19:14,122 --> 00:19:17,421
－What  is  it?
－Looks  like  lyrics

387
00:19:17,459 --> 00:19:20,860
When  l  die    l  want to  be  high

388
00:19:20,896 --> 00:19:25,162
Never  worry    just  bury  me
along  with  my currency

389
00:19:31,673 --> 00:19:36,610
For  Dwayne  Grant  
A.K.A.  Marvin  Gardens…

390
00:19:36,645 --> 00:19:39,205
Justice  was just an  illusion

391
00:19:39,248 --> 00:19:40,613
l  made this  life

392
00:19:40,649 --> 00:19:43,277
So  he  escaped  into
an  illusion  of  his  own  making

393
00:19:43,318 --> 00:19:44,808
And  l  deserve this  life

394
00:19:44,853 --> 00:19:48,289
Dwayne  Grant－－
living  out  his  dreams…

395
00:19:48,323 --> 00:19:50,120
in  the  Twilight Zone

396
00:19:50,158 --> 00:19:52,490
Nobody's  gonna  take  it from  me
