2
00:00:44,548 --> 00:00:46,650
Nurse?

3
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,819
Brought you  your
sleeping  medicine    honey

4
00:00:48,819 --> 00:00:50,721
ls  it  night already?

5
00:00:50,721 --> 00:00:51,779
lt's  9: 30

6
00:00:53,156 --> 00:00:54,825
What about the  day?

7
00:00:54,825 --> 00:00:56,860
What about  it?

8
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,496
Was  it a  beautiful  day?

9
00:00:59,496 --> 00:01:02,466
Was the  sun  out?
Was  it warm?

10
00:01:02,466 --> 00:01:04,668
Kind  of warm

11
00:01:04,668 --> 00:01:06,470
Clouds

12
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,205
Were there  clouds  in  the  sky?

13
00:01:08,205 --> 00:01:09,673
l  suppose there  were

14
00:01:09,673 --> 00:01:11,775
l  never  was  much
for  staring  up...

15
00:01:11,775 --> 00:01:13,477
at the  sky all  the time

16
00:01:13,477 --> 00:01:17,180
l  used  to  look  up
at the  clouds  a  lot

17
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,715
lf you  stare  at them
long  enough...

18
00:01:18,715 --> 00:01:21,985
they  become things  
you  know?

19
00:01:21,985 --> 00:01:25,055
Ships    people...

20
00:01:25,055 --> 00:01:26,823
Anything  you  want    really...

21
00:01:26,823 --> 00:01:29,526
if you  stare  at them
long  enough

22
00:01:29,526 --> 00:01:31,528
lt's time to take
your temperature  now

23
00:01:31,528 --> 00:01:32,829
Just one  other thing?

24
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:34,898
Well?

25
00:01:34,898 --> 00:01:36,199
When    nurse?

26
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:37,928
When  will  they take
the  bandages  off?

27
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,505
How  long?

28
00:01:41,505 --> 00:01:43,240
Until    uh...

29
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,107
Until  they decide
it's  safe for your face

30
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:49,913
l  know

31
00:01:49,913 --> 00:01:51,214
lt's  pretty  bad    isn't  it?

32
00:01:51,214 --> 00:01:53,116
l've  seen  worse

33
00:01:53,116 --> 00:01:55,052
But  it's  pretty  bad  
isn't  it?

34
00:01:55,052 --> 00:01:58,522
l  know  it's  pretty  bad

35
00:01:58,522 --> 00:02:00,323
Ever  since  l  was
a  little  girl...

36
00:02:00,323 --> 00:02:03,827
people  have  always
turned  away from  me

37
00:02:03,827 --> 00:02:05,629
l  can  remember
a  child  screaming...

38
00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:07,697
when  she  looked  at  me

39
00:02:07,697 --> 00:02:09,833
l  never  wanted
to  be  beautiful

40
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:12,436
l  just wanted－－
l  just wanted  people...

41
00:02:12,436 --> 00:02:14,304
not to  scream  when
they  looked  at  me!

42
00:02:14,304 --> 00:02:15,939
When    nurse?

43
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:17,908
When  will  they take
the  bandages  off?

44
00:02:17,908 --> 00:02:19,432
Please?

45
00:02:20,644 --> 00:02:22,512
Easy    easy

46
00:02:22,512 --> 00:02:23,945
Let  me take
your temperature

47
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:39,463
Maybe tomorrow.
Maybe the  next day

48
00:02:39,463 --> 00:02:41,031
You've  been  waiting
so  long  now...

49
00:02:41,031 --> 00:02:42,365
it  really doesn't  make
that  much  difference...

50
00:02:42,365 --> 00:02:46,062
whether  it's  2  days
or  weeks    now    does  it?

51
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:21,228
Paging  Dr.  Stateman.
Dr.  Stateman    please

52
00:03:25,809 --> 00:03:27,511
Dr.  Bernardi

53
00:03:27,511 --> 00:03:30,480
Evening  report
on  patient  307

54
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,049
Resting  comfortably.
No temperature  change

55
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:35,176
Thank you    nurse.
l'll  be  right down

56
00:03:37,487 --> 00:03:39,789
Ever  see  her face?

57
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:41,625
307?

58
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,226
lf  it were  mine  
l'd  bury  myself...

59
00:03:43,226 --> 00:03:45,862
in  a  grave  someplace

60
00:03:45,862 --> 00:03:49,166
You  have  been  introduced
to  Miss Janet Tyler...

61
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:52,402
who  lives  in  a  very  private
world  of darkness...

62
00:03:52,402 --> 00:03:55,172
a  universe  whose  dimensions
are the  size    thickness...

63
00:03:55,172 --> 00:03:58,308
and  length  of the  bandages
that cover  her face

64
00:03:58,308 --> 00:03:59,743
ln  a  moment    we'll  witness...

65
00:03:59,743 --> 00:04:01,311
the  removal
of those  bandages...

66
00:04:01,311 --> 00:04:03,113
and  we'll  see
what's  under them

67
00:04:03,113 --> 00:04:04,181
Keeping  in  mind  
of course...

68
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:06,950
that we're  not to  be
surprised  by what we  see...

69
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,252
because this  isn't
just a  hospital...

70
00:04:09,252 --> 00:04:11,454
and  this  patient  
Janet Tyler...

71
00:04:11,454 --> 00:04:14,991
patient  number  307  
is  not just a  woman...

72
00:04:14,991 --> 00:04:16,593
because this
happens to  be...

73
00:04:16,593 --> 00:04:18,686
the  Twilight Zone

74
00:04:19,362 --> 00:04:22,899
You're traveling
to  another  dimension...

75
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:27,237
a  dimension  not only
of sight and  sound...

76
00:04:27,237 --> 00:04:29,773
but of  mind

77
00:04:29,773 --> 00:04:33,210
A journey
into  a  wondrous  land...

78
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,478
whose  boundaries
are  only that...

79
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:37,503
of the  imagination

80
00:04:40,016 --> 00:04:43,008
You're  entering...

81
00:04:50,293 --> 00:04:51,461
How  about
her  blood  pressure?

82
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:53,029
1 20  over  80

83
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:55,232
Good.
Any thyroid  reaction...

84
00:04:55,232 --> 00:04:56,800
since the  latest  round
of  injections?

85
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,301
Nothing  out
of the  ordinary

86
00:04:58,301 --> 00:05:00,503
All  right.  Nurse    you
can  come  back  at  1 1 :00...

87
00:05:00,503 --> 00:05:02,138
and  give  her
the  usual  sedative

88
00:05:02,138 --> 00:05:04,774
All  right    Doctor

89
00:05:04,774 --> 00:05:07,210
Warm  this  evening  
Miss  Tyler?

90
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,779
l  thought  it was.
Very warm

91
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:11,178
You  can  take
my word  for  it

92
00:05:12,549 --> 00:05:16,186
We'll  have those  bandages
off you  very shortly

93
00:05:16,186 --> 00:05:18,722
l  expect you're
uncomfortable

94
00:05:18,722 --> 00:05:20,690
l'm  used  to  it  by  now

95
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:25,395
l  have  no  doubt.
This  is your...ninth?

96
00:05:25,395 --> 00:05:27,030
ls this
your  ninth  procedure?

97
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,588
The  1 1th

98
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:32,335
Sometimes  l  think  l've
lived  my whole  life...

99
00:05:32,335 --> 00:05:35,238
inside  of a  dark  cave

100
00:05:35,238 --> 00:05:36,906
There's  kind  of
a  comfort    though...

101
00:05:36,906 --> 00:05:40,010
living  in  a  cave

102
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,477
lt's  so  private

103
00:05:43,346 --> 00:05:45,541
No  one  can  ever  see  me

104
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,885
lt's  hopeless  
isn't  it    Doctor?

105
00:05:48,885 --> 00:05:50,954
l'll  never  look
any different

106
00:05:50,954 --> 00:05:52,989
Well    that's  hard  to  say

107
00:05:52,989 --> 00:05:54,691
Up  until  now  
you  haven't  responded...

108
00:05:54,691 --> 00:05:56,259
to  any of our  procedures

109
00:05:56,259 --> 00:05:58,428
But there's  no  way
of telling...

110
00:05:58,428 --> 00:06:01,397
not  until  we  get
the  wrapping  off

111
00:06:06,202 --> 00:06:09,806
Your  1 1th  visit

112
00:06:09,806 --> 00:06:11,574
No  more  after this    either

113
00:06:11,574 --> 00:06:13,910
No  more tries

114
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,746
l  don't  know
what else  we  can  do...

115
00:06:16,746 --> 00:06:19,049
not without
endangering  your  life

116
00:06:19,049 --> 00:06:22,018
You  very well
may  have  responded...

117
00:06:22,018 --> 00:06:23,987
to this  last treatment

118
00:06:23,987 --> 00:06:25,255
We just won't
know for  sure...

119
00:06:25,255 --> 00:06:27,123
until  l  take
those  wraps  off

120
00:06:27,123 --> 00:06:29,592
But  if  l  haven't
responded    then  what?

121
00:06:29,592 --> 00:06:31,361
There  are  alternatives

122
00:06:31,361 --> 00:06:32,350
Like?

123
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:40,403
Don't you  know?

124
00:06:40,403 --> 00:06:42,268
l  know

125
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:46,209
You're  not alone    Miss  Tyler.
You  realize that    don't you?

126
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:47,477
You're  hardly alone

127
00:06:47,477 --> 00:06:49,646
Many others  share
your  misfortune...

128
00:06:49,646 --> 00:06:51,948
people  who  look
much  as you  do

129
00:06:51,948 --> 00:06:53,750
Now    one
of the  alternatives－－

130
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,653
should  this  last  procedure
prove to  be  unsuccessful－－

131
00:06:56,653 --> 00:06:58,822
the  state  will  allow you
to  live  comfortably...

132
00:06:58,822 --> 00:07:01,958
among  those
of your  own  kind

133
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,693
My own  kind?

134
00:07:03,693 --> 00:07:05,061
lt's  a  haven
for  people  like you

135
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:06,830
Now    who  knows?
You  might even  like  it there

136
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,832
But  it's  not fair    Doctor!

137
00:07:08,832 --> 00:07:10,967
l  don't want to  live
among  freaks!

138
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:13,436
l  want to  live
among  normal  people

139
00:07:13,436 --> 00:07:15,138
Look    Miss  Tyler  
we  are  not  unsympathetic...

140
00:07:15,138 --> 00:07:16,473
to your  condition

141
00:07:16,473 --> 00:07:18,675
Your  presence  here  in  this
hospital  attests to that

142
00:07:18,675 --> 00:07:20,477
We're  gonna  do  everything
we  can  for you...

143
00:07:20,477 --> 00:07:23,179
but you're  gonna  have
to  be  realistic

144
00:07:23,179 --> 00:07:26,816
l  could  wear  a  mask
or this  bandage

145
00:07:26,816 --> 00:07:31,154
l  wouldn't  bother  anyone.
l'd  just go  my own  way

146
00:07:31,154 --> 00:07:33,790
l'd  take  a  job    any job

147
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:37,660
Who  are you  people    anyway?
And  what gives you...

148
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,497
the  right to  decide  where
l  live  and  how  l  live?

149
00:07:40,497 --> 00:07:41,564
l'm  just a  doctor

150
00:07:41,564 --> 00:07:43,233
Only the  state  can
determine  social  policy

151
00:07:43,233 --> 00:07:45,034
All  we  can  do
is follow the  rules...

152
00:07:45,034 --> 00:07:46,603
that they  lay down  for  us

153
00:07:46,603 --> 00:07:48,838
But  it's  not fair    Doctor!

154
00:07:48,838 --> 00:07:51,341
The  people  who  are  different
having  to  stay away...

155
00:07:51,341 --> 00:07:53,009
from  the  people
who  are  normal

156
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:55,378
Who  decides  what's  normal?

157
00:07:55,378 --> 00:07:57,046
The  state  isn't God    Doctor!

158
00:07:57,046 --> 00:07:58,047
Miss  Tyler    please!

159
00:07:58,047 --> 00:08:00,083
But the  state  is  not God!

160
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,285
lt  hasn't the  right to－－
to  punish  people...

161
00:08:02,285 --> 00:08:04,554
for  an  accident of  birth

162
00:08:04,554 --> 00:08:06,890
lt  hasn't the  right
to  make  ugliness  a  crime

163
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,858
Miss  Tyler!
Now    l've  gotta  ask...

164
00:08:08,858 --> 00:08:10,527
that you  stop this  kind
of talk  immediately!

165
00:08:10,527 --> 00:08:11,694
Do you  understand  me?!

166
00:08:11,694 --> 00:08:13,389
lmmediately!

167
00:09:05,615 --> 00:09:08,709
l  can  feel
the  night out there

168
00:09:12,355 --> 00:09:14,789
l  can  feel  the  air

169
00:09:19,362 --> 00:09:21,796
l  can  smell  the flowers

170
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:25,728
Mmm

171
00:09:32,108 --> 00:09:35,111
Please take this  off of  me

172
00:09:35,111 --> 00:09:37,146
Please take this  off of  me!

173
00:09:37,146 --> 00:09:38,477
Take this  off of  me!

174
00:09:43,152 --> 00:09:45,321
Please    take this  off of  me!

175
00:09:45,321 --> 00:09:47,156
Miss  Tyler.  Nurse!

176
00:09:47,156 --> 00:09:49,647
－No!
－Got  her  legs!

177
00:09:52,061 --> 00:09:53,162
No!

178
00:09:53,162 --> 00:09:54,163
lt's  all  right

179
00:09:54,163 --> 00:09:56,032
Please!

180
00:09:56,032 --> 00:09:59,335
The  doctor's  decided  to
remove the  bandages  in  307

181
00:09:59,335 --> 00:10:01,701
He  wants to  have
the  anesthetist stand  by

182
00:10:05,642 --> 00:10:09,712
Anesthesia    please.
Wanted  for  307

183
00:10:09,712 --> 00:10:12,815
Yes    when  she  sees
what she  looks  like...

184
00:10:12,815 --> 00:10:14,908
she  may get violent

185
00:10:27,897 --> 00:10:30,633
You  look tired    Doctor

186
00:10:30,633 --> 00:10:32,635
l  suppose  l  am

187
00:10:32,635 --> 00:10:35,271
You've  been  under  a
great deal  of tension

188
00:10:35,271 --> 00:10:37,307
l  know  how  much
it  means to you...

189
00:10:37,307 --> 00:10:40,843
this  case  in  307

190
00:10:40,843 --> 00:10:44,147
Well    you  try and  be
impersonal  about these things

191
00:10:44,147 --> 00:10:46,983
You  do  everything
medically  possible...

192
00:10:46,983 --> 00:10:49,719
everything
humanly  possible

193
00:10:49,719 --> 00:10:51,588
Then  in  the  end  
you  cross your fingers...

194
00:10:51,588 --> 00:10:54,958
and  hope for  a  miracle

195
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:55,992
But you  know  
once  in  a  while...

196
00:10:55,992 --> 00:10:58,661
a  miracle  does  happen...

197
00:10:58,661 --> 00:11:00,096
just often  enough
to  let you  know...

198
00:11:00,096 --> 00:11:03,066
that you're  not wrong
or foolish  to  hope for  one

199
00:11:03,066 --> 00:11:04,100
But you're
destroying  yourself...

200
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,668
getting
so  personally  involved

201
00:11:05,668 --> 00:11:06,703
l  know

202
00:11:06,703 --> 00:11:09,238
Don't you  think
l  told  myself that?

203
00:11:09,238 --> 00:11:12,542
l've just seen  that woman's
real  face    nurse...

204
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:16,112
the face  of  her  real  self

205
00:11:16,112 --> 00:11:17,513
lt's  a  good  face

206
00:11:17,513 --> 00:11:19,674
lt's  a  human  face

207
00:11:23,987 --> 00:11:27,423
l  understand  
but  l  must confess...

208
00:11:27,423 --> 00:11:29,492
it's  easier for  me
to think  of  her  as  human...

209
00:11:29,492 --> 00:11:30,827
when  her face
is  covered  up

210
00:11:30,827 --> 00:11:32,395
Why?

211
00:11:32,395 --> 00:11:34,230
Why shouldn't  people
be  allowed  to  be  different?

212
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,099
Why?  Doctor    please!

213
00:11:36,099 --> 00:11:37,867
Be  careful

214
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:41,530
－What you're talking  is－－
－ls treason?

215
00:11:43,106 --> 00:11:46,209
This  case  has
upset your  balance...

216
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:48,234
your  sense  of values

217
00:11:49,846 --> 00:11:53,182
l'll  be  all  right
once the  wraps  are  off...

218
00:11:53,182 --> 00:11:56,819
once  l  know  one  way
or the  other

219
00:11:56,819 --> 00:11:57,820
She  keeps  complaining
about  her  legs

220
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,555
Yeah    l'll  be  down
to  see  her  soon

221
00:11:59,555 --> 00:12:01,257
And  now  
ladies  and  gentlemen...

222
00:12:01,257 --> 00:12:02,258
our  leader

223
00:12:02,258 --> 00:12:03,993
The  leader's  speech
is  about to  begin

224
00:12:03,993 --> 00:12:06,596
Good  evening  
ladies  and  gentlemen

225
00:12:06,596 --> 00:12:09,098
Tonight  l  shall
talk to you...

226
00:12:09,098 --> 00:12:12,001
about glorious  conformity...

227
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:14,837
about the  delights
and  the  ultimate  pleasure...

228
00:12:14,837 --> 00:12:17,807
of our  unified  society

229
00:12:17,807 --> 00:12:19,676
You  recall    of course...

230
00:12:19,676 --> 00:12:23,513
that directionless  
unproductive...

231
00:12:23,513 --> 00:12:27,050
oversentimentalized  era
in  man's  history...

232
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,385
when  it was  assumed
that dissent was...

233
00:12:29,385 --> 00:12:32,822
a  natural  and  healthy
adjunct to  society

234
00:12:32,822 --> 00:12:36,392
You  recall  that during
this  period  of time...

235
00:12:36,392 --> 00:12:40,296
there  was  a  strange  
oversentimentalized  concept...

236
00:12:40,296 --> 00:12:43,933
that  it  mattered  not
that  people  were  different...

237
00:12:43,933 --> 00:12:45,601
that this  world  could  exist...

238
00:12:45,601 --> 00:12:48,371
in  some  sort
of crazy  patchwork...

239
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:52,508
glued  together
in  a  fragmented  society

240
00:12:52,508 --> 00:12:57,445
We  know  now
that that was  wrong

241
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:00,683
Now  as  l  unwrap...

242
00:13:00,683 --> 00:13:02,719
l  want you  to  keep
your  eyes  open

243
00:13:02,719 --> 00:13:04,821
l  want you
to  describe to  me...

244
00:13:04,821 --> 00:13:07,490
the  different shading
of  light as you  perceive  it...

245
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:10,727
as  each  layer  of those
bandages  come  off

246
00:13:10,727 --> 00:13:12,128
All  right

247
00:13:12,128 --> 00:13:15,198
Now    if you  make
any  movement...

248
00:13:15,198 --> 00:13:16,833
or  if you  start to  get
emotional  on  us  in  any way...

249
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,501
l'm  gonna  have the  nurses
hold  you  down...

250
00:13:18,501 --> 00:13:20,903
and  have the  anesthetist
put you  under  sedation

251
00:13:20,903 --> 00:13:23,439
ls that  understood?

252
00:13:23,439 --> 00:13:26,242
l  promise...l  won't

253
00:13:26,242 --> 00:13:27,641
All  right

254
00:13:51,434 --> 00:13:54,537
Do you  see  any  light  now  
Miss  Tyler?

255
00:13:54,537 --> 00:13:55,905
Just a  little

256
00:13:55,905 --> 00:14:00,137
lt  looks...
lt  looks  gray

257
00:14:08,684 --> 00:14:10,586
How  about  now    Miss  Tyler?

258
00:14:10,586 --> 00:14:14,524
lt's  bright    very  bright

259
00:14:14,524 --> 00:14:16,159
Good

260
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:19,962
l'm  at the  last  layer  now  
Miss  Tyler

261
00:14:19,962 --> 00:14:22,431
l  can－－

262
00:14:22,431 --> 00:14:24,767
l  can  see your  outline

263
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,736
Just vaguely...

264
00:14:26,736 --> 00:14:29,105
but  l  can  see you

265
00:14:29,105 --> 00:14:31,307
Now  l'm  gonna  remove
the  last  bandage    Miss  Tyler

266
00:14:31,307 --> 00:14:32,375
Do you  want a  mirror?

267
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,510
No

268
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,945
No    thank you

269
00:14:35,945 --> 00:14:37,513
No  mirror

270
00:14:37,513 --> 00:14:40,283
l  want you  to  remember
one thing    Miss  Tyler

271
00:14:40,283 --> 00:14:41,818
Are you  listening?

272
00:14:41,818 --> 00:14:44,487
Yes    l'm  listening

273
00:14:44,487 --> 00:14:46,756
We've  done  all  we  could

274
00:14:46,756 --> 00:14:49,025
lf we  were  successful  
all  well  and  good...

275
00:14:49,025 --> 00:14:50,893
there  are  no  problems

276
00:14:50,893 --> 00:14:52,895
lf    however  
this final  procedure...

277
00:14:52,895 --> 00:14:54,931
has  not achieved
the  desired  results...

278
00:14:54,931 --> 00:14:56,465
keep  in  mind
you  can  still  live...

279
00:14:56,465 --> 00:14:57,867
a  long  and  fruitful  life...

280
00:14:57,867 --> 00:15:00,136
among  people
of your  own  kind

281
00:15:00,136 --> 00:15:01,938
As  soon  as  we  discover
these  results...

282
00:15:01,938 --> 00:15:03,439
we  can  either
release you  or－－

283
00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:04,941
Doctor?

284
00:15:04,941 --> 00:15:06,876
Yes?

285
00:15:06,876 --> 00:15:13,015
lf...if  l'm  still－－
if  l'm  still  so  ugly...

286
00:15:13,015 --> 00:15:15,718
is there
any other  alternative?

287
00:15:15,718 --> 00:15:17,787
Could－－
could  l  be  put away?

288
00:15:17,787 --> 00:15:20,723
Well    under  certain
circumstances    Miss  Tyler...

289
00:15:20,723 --> 00:15:23,693
the  state  does  provide
for the  extermination...

290
00:15:23,693 --> 00:15:26,028
of certain  undesirables

291
00:15:26,028 --> 00:15:28,364
There  are  many factors
to  be  considered    though...

292
00:15:28,364 --> 00:15:30,266
that  bear  on  that decision

293
00:15:30,266 --> 00:15:33,369
And  under the  circumstances  
considering  your  age...

294
00:15:33,369 --> 00:15:35,338
and  your  general
physical  condition...

295
00:15:35,338 --> 00:15:37,940
l  doubt very  much  if
we  could  permit anything...

296
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,909
but your transfer
to  a  communal  group...

297
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:44,614
of  people  with  your－－
your  disability

298
00:15:44,614 --> 00:15:46,482
You'll  make  me  go    then?

299
00:15:46,482 --> 00:15:49,552
That'll  probably  be the  case

300
00:15:49,552 --> 00:15:52,755
All  right    Miss  Tyler    now
remain  very quiet    please...

301
00:15:52,755 --> 00:15:54,450
and  keep your  eyes  open

302
00:16:21,217 --> 00:16:23,619
All  right    Miss  Tyler

303
00:16:23,619 --> 00:16:25,221
Now  here  comes
the  last of  it

304
00:16:25,221 --> 00:16:28,384
l  wish  you  every good  luck

305
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,812
Oh    hideous

306
00:16:49,812 --> 00:16:53,304
No  change.
No  change  at all!

307
00:16:54,517 --> 00:16:55,584
Oh    no

308
00:16:55,584 --> 00:16:58,519
Ahh!  Poor thing

309
00:17:01,023 --> 00:17:02,923
No!

310
00:17:06,262 --> 00:17:07,897
Needle    please.  l  knew
this  would  happen

311
00:17:07,897 --> 00:17:09,455
Turn  on  the  lights!

312
00:17:14,971 --> 00:17:16,404
Needle    please

313
00:17:20,343 --> 00:17:21,844
Stop that  patient!

314
00:17:21,844 --> 00:17:23,646
Stop  her!

315
00:17:23,646 --> 00:17:27,249
There  must  be
a  single  purpose...

316
00:17:27,249 --> 00:17:29,986
a  single  norm...

317
00:17:29,986 --> 00:17:31,988
a  single  approach...

318
00:17:31,988 --> 00:17:32,989
Aah!

319
00:17:32,989 --> 00:17:35,925
A  single  philosophy
of government

320
00:17:35,925 --> 00:17:40,396
That  is  why we  must
no  longer  permit...

321
00:17:40,396 --> 00:17:44,266
the  ugly to  exist
within  our  society!

322
00:17:44,266 --> 00:17:47,069
－They  must  be  removed!
－No!

323
00:17:47,069 --> 00:17:48,070
lt  is  essential
in  this  society...

324
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,739
that we  not only
have  a  norm...

325
00:17:49,739 --> 00:17:52,902
but that we  conform－－

326
00:17:55,778 --> 00:18:01,317
Conformity we  must worship
and  hold  sacred

327
00:18:01,317 --> 00:18:05,988
Conformity  is  our  key
to  survival

328
00:18:05,988 --> 00:18:08,491
Don't  be  afraid    Miss  Tyler

329
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:10,426
This  is  a  representative
of the  group...

330
00:18:10,426 --> 00:18:11,961
you're to  live  with

331
00:18:11,961 --> 00:18:13,696
Oddly enough  
you  came  right to  him

332
00:18:13,696 --> 00:18:16,365
Come  on    now.
He  won't  hurt you

333
00:18:16,365 --> 00:18:20,836
Janet...this  is  Mr.  Smith

334
00:18:20,836 --> 00:18:22,104
He's  in  charge
of the  village  group...

335
00:18:22,104 --> 00:18:24,607
you're to  live  with

336
00:18:24,607 --> 00:18:27,143
You'll  be  able to  live
among  your  own  kind

337
00:18:27,143 --> 00:18:29,111
Miss  Tyler?

338
00:18:32,348 --> 00:18:36,011
We  have  a  lovely village
and  wonderful  people

339
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,223
l  think you'll  like  it
where  l'm  gonna  take you

340
00:18:41,223 --> 00:18:42,658
You'll  be  with
your  own  kind...

341
00:18:42,658 --> 00:18:44,994
and  after  a  little  while－－

342
00:18:44,994 --> 00:18:47,530
you'd  be  amazed
at  how  little  a  while－－

343
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:50,699
you'll  feel  a  sense
of great  belonging

344
00:18:50,699 --> 00:18:53,469
You'll  feel  a  sense
of  being  loved

345
00:18:53,469 --> 00:18:57,030
And  you  will  be  loved  
Miss  Tyler

346
00:18:59,942 --> 00:19:01,068
Please

347
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,551
Miss  Tyler?

348
00:19:08,551 --> 00:19:10,453
Would  you  get
your things  now?

349
00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:12,353
We  can  leave  anytime

350
00:19:14,523 --> 00:19:16,425
Mr.  Smith?

351
00:19:16,425 --> 00:19:18,017
Yes?

352
00:19:19,762 --> 00:19:23,199
Why are  some  of  us
born  so  ugly?

353
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:27,837
l  don't  know    Miss  Tyler.
l  really don't  know

354
00:19:27,837 --> 00:19:30,639
But you  know  something?

355
00:19:30,639 --> 00:19:33,375
lt doesn't  really  matter

356
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:36,479
There's  an  old  saying...

357
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:40,082
A  very    very old  saying

358
00:19:40,082 --> 00:19:44,075
Beauty  is  in  the  eye
of the  beholder

359
00:19:45,721 --> 00:19:46,789
When  we  leave  here...

360
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:48,591
when  we  go
to the  village...

361
00:19:48,591 --> 00:19:50,626
keep that  in  mind

362
00:19:50,626 --> 00:19:51,627
Try    Miss  Tyler

363
00:19:51,627 --> 00:19:53,696
Say  it over  and  over
in  your  mind

364
00:19:53,696 --> 00:19:57,325
Beauty  is  in  the  eye
of the  beholder

365
00:20:07,576 --> 00:20:11,740
We'll  get your things  
and  we'll  leave

366
00:20:43,012 --> 00:20:45,748
Good－bye    Miss  Tyler

367
00:20:45,748 --> 00:20:47,550
Now the  questions
that come to  mind :

368
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,852
Where  is this  place  
and  when  is  it?

369
00:20:49,852 --> 00:20:52,588
What  kind  of world  is this
where  ugliness  is the  norm...

370
00:20:52,588 --> 00:20:55,191
and  beauty the  deviation
from  that  norm?

371
00:20:55,191 --> 00:20:56,659
You  want an  answer?

372
00:20:56,659 --> 00:21:00,863
The  answer  is  it doesn't
make  any difference...

373
00:21:00,863 --> 00:21:02,765
because the  old  saying
happens to  be true

374
00:21:02,765 --> 00:21:05,434
Beauty  is  in  the  eye
of the  beholder

375
00:21:05,434 --> 00:21:08,204
ln  this year
or  1 00 years  hence...

376
00:21:08,204 --> 00:21:09,205
on  this  planet...

377
00:21:09,205 --> 00:21:11,840
or  wherever there  is
intelligent  life...

378
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,610
beauty  is  in  the  eye
of the  beholder

379
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:17,602
Lesson  to  be  learned
in  the  Twilight Zone
