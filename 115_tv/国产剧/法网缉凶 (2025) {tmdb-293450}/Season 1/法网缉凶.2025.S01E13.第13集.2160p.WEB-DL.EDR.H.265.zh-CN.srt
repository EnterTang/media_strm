《心灵缉凶》前情提要 
Previously on Cracked

6
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,220
雷德利医生在您面前
What kinds of things would

7
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,820
是怎样评价布莱克警官的
Dr. Ridley tell you about Detective Black?

8
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:10,020
她会定期向我汇报艾登的心理状况
She would keep me apprised of Aidan's state of mind.

9
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,220
艾登 真的对不起
Aidan, I'm really sorry.

10
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:13,930
我无法再这样继续下去了
I can't do this anymore.

11
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,960
你造成的 你自己解决
You broke it, you have to fix it.

12
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,560
在另行通知之前 艾登 你和里奥一组
Until further notice, Aidan, you're partnered with Leo.

13
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,670
- 波比 你和丹妮拉一组 - 什么
- Poppy, you're with Daniella. - What?

14
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,400
- 我看过现场报告了 - 放下武器 伙计
- I read the scene report. - Put it down, buddy!

15
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,040
布莱克警探用枪瞄准一个嫌疑犯
Detective Black had his weapon trained on a suspect,

16
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,110
然后嫌疑犯跑掉了 
and then the suspect ran away.

17
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,080
艾登肯定有什么事
Something happened with Aidan.

18
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,110
我不知道他脑子里怎么想的 
I don't know where his mind went,

19
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,640
但是他走神了几秒钟
but he was gone for several seconds.

20
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,180
像是创伤后精神压力综合症
Looked like post-traumatic stress.

21
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,080
这很严重
This is serious.

22
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:39,080
我射伤了某人 但我却没得到我想要的结果
I shot someone. I didn't get the result that I was hoping for.

23
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,480
你需要问你自己
The question you need to ask yourself is:

24
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,090
你是否还胜任你的工作
Are you still doing your job well?

25
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,690
嘿 小姑娘 你还好吗
Hey, little girl, you OK?

26
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,070
一对夫妇发现她走得有点晕乎乎的
So, a couple noticed her walking around sort of dazed.

27
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,870
他们想靠近她 她就钻到椅子下面了
They approached her, she ducks under here.

28
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,040
我不知道怎么办 
I don't know.

29
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,280
我试着哄她出来 但是她越抓越紧
I tried coaxing her out, but she just keeps holding on tighter.

30
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,750
- 有人报案丢孩子了吗 - 没有
- Anyone report a missing child? - No.

31
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,090
嗨 我是里奥 我是个护工
Hi, I'm Leo. I'm a nurse.

32
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,520
你介意我坐你旁边吗
Do you mind if I sit next to you?

33
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,730
然后你就找罪案心理分析科  为什么
And you called Psych Crimes. Why?

34
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,230
不然怎么办
Why not?

35
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,660
我的确看到这儿有个精神不正常的
Well, I can see the psych here, but...

36
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,600
但是没看到犯罪啊
not so much crime.

37
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,310
我只剩下一片了
It's my last piece.

38
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,380
知道吗 我总是和我孩子说
You know, I tell my kids all the time

39
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,850
不能躺着吃口香糖 会噎住的
that they can't chew gum laying down or else they'll choke.

40
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,920
所以要是你坐起来 最后一片就给你
So if you can sit up, the last piece is yours.

41
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,520
你说呢
What do you say?

42
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,190
想坐我旁边吗
Want to sit next to me?

43
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,800
看到那边的警官了吗
See the police officer over there?

44
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,270
那是我搭档 所以你很安全
That's my partner, so you're safe.

45
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,410
那么 你叫什么名字
So, what's your name?

46
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,650
喔 好冷啊
Ooh, it's cold.

47
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,150
啊
Ah.

48
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,020
我给你围上 好吗
How about I put this around you, OK?

49
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,300
很高兴认识你 奥利维亚
Nice to meet you, Olivia.

50
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,100
查理爸爸一号 学校登记录上记载
Papa Charlie-1, school records list

51
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,110
学生奥利维亚・华莱士家住罗克斯伯勒巷182号 
182 Roxborough Lane for student Olivia Wallace.

52
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,240
奥利维亚 我们在这儿很安全  
We're safe here, Olivia, OK?

53
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,770
能告诉我你和谁一起住吗
Can you tell me who you live with?

54
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,080
奥利维亚 告诉我谁在你的房子里
Olivia, can you tell me who's in your house?

55
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,790
我搭档现在在你家
My partner is in your house.

56
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,090
有什么他需要知道的吗
Is there anything he needs to know?

57
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,910
艾登
Aidan.

58
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,180
艾登
Aidan.

59
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,190
里奥
Leo.

60
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,620
打给急救中心 带那个女孩去医院
Call EMS. Take the girl to the hospital.

61
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,530
陪着她 然后给加利格拉打电话
Stay with her, and call Caligra.

62
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,090
跟她说 我需要雷德利
Tell her I need Ridley.

63
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,400
# 我今早起床 #
I got out of bed today

64
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,440
# 对上帝发誓 我看不见我的脸 #
Swear to God I couldn't see my face

65
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,010
# 我今早起床 #
I got out of bed today

66
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,180
# 注视着一缕灵魂 # 
Staring at a ghost

67
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,050
# 你看到我的灵魂了吗 # 
Oh, have you seen my ghost

68
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,780
# 看到了吗 看到了吗 # 
Seen my ghost, seen my ghost

69
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,550
# 你看到我的灵魂了吗 # 
Oh, have you seen my ghost

70
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,770
# 它凝视着地面 # 
Staring at the ground

71
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,260
心灵缉凶 第一季第13集

72
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,300
死者名叫奥斯卡・华莱士 三十九岁
His name's Oscar Wallace... age 39,

73
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,240
历史学教授 航海发烧友 儿童棒球教练
history professor, avid sailor, kids' baseball coach.

74
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,500
他妻子三周前去了非洲
His wife's been in Africa for three weeks.

75
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,010
- 她本该今天早上回来的 - 去旅行还是别的
- She's due back this morning. - Safari or something?

76
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,870
不是 她是位人权律师 
No, she's a human rights lawyer.

77
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,770
艾思梅・贝尔克 你听说过她吗
Esme Belk. Have you heard of her?

78
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:32,180
根据邻居们的说法
I guess she's famous or something,

79
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,050
我猜她应该很有名气
according to the neighbours.

80
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,020
脖子周围有勒痕
Circumferential laceration on his neck.

81
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,890
貌似是用绳索勒死的
It looks like ligature strangulation.

82
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,320
九岁大的孩子早上起来 想要的只是个华夫饼
Nine years old and you wake up, all you want is a waffle.

83
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,860
这么说 你和雷德利又开始搭档了
So, uh, you and Ridley are partners again?

84
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,430
没有 我只是需要她的头脑
No, I just need her brain on this.

85
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,200
嗨
Hi.

86
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,340
真是惨绝人寰
The brutality is striking.

87
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,580
没错 肩膀上有擦伤
Yeah, bruising on the shoulder.

88
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,550
肯定是踩住了胳膊
Must have just stepped on the arm

89
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,620
还抓住了手腕
and grabbed the wrist.

90
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,320
紧接着是难以忍受的疼痛 
Unbearable pain ensued...

91
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,160
除非他的胳膊是死后被扭断的
unless he snapped the arms post mortem,

92
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,410
但我认为是死前被扭断的
but I'm thinking ante mortem.

93
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,120
- 为什么 - 你看 这么好的房子
- Why? - Well, it's a nice house,

94
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,930
他应该很有钱 行凶者也许想要图财
he's got money; Killer probably wanted some of it.

95
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,230
如果真的是想敲诈
There's easier parts of the body to break

96
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,770
还有更容易下手的身体部位
if extortion's the name of the game.

97
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,800
"给我钱 不然我就卸了你的胳膊"
"Give me the money or I'll break your arms."

98
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,840
先一边 然后另一边
First one, then the other.

99
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,410
然后他的头使劲上下挣扎 于是行凶者
Then his head's bobbing up and down, so the killer slips

100
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,870
找了根绳子勒住他的脖子 然后
a ligature around his neck, and then

101
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,880
就只剩下了无边的黑暗
it's nothing but darkness.

102
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,880
胳膊肯定是在传达一个信息
The arms, they gotta be a message,

103
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,250
是在暗示什么 一个标志 它们想表达什么呢
an allusion to something, a sign. What do they signify?

104
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,120
艾登 加利格拉说是你让我来这儿的
Aidan, Caligra said that you wanted me here with you,

105
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,690
但是我不
but I don't...

106
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,230
我们在这儿做什么呢 艾登
What are we doing here, Aidan?

107
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,600
死尸一具 怪异的双臂
Dead guy, weird arms?

108
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,870
我以为你集中注意了
I thought you were paying attention.

109
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,590
这是我家
This is my house.

110
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,320
- 艾思梅・贝尔克・华莱士吗 - 是我 发生什么了
- Esme Belk Wallace? - Yes. What's going on?

111
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:34,630
我女儿呢 奥斯卡呢
Where's my daughter? Where's Oscar?

112
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,340
- 嘿 - 嘿
- Hey. - Hey.

113
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,880
- 她怎么样 - 你是她叔叔吗
- How is she? - You're her uncle?

114
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,210
- 是的 艾略特・贝尔克 - 里奥・贝克特
- Yeah, Elliott Belk. - Leo Beckett.

115
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,650
我们通过电话 呃 奥利维亚还没缓过来
We spoke on the phone. Um... Olivia's still in shock.

116
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,650
在某种程度上她能作出回应 
She's responsive to a degree,

117
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:58,770
但是她还是不愿开口说话
but she's not talking yet,

118
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,120
我们还在等你姐姐的电话
and we're still waiting for your sister to call.

119
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,250
她的邻居说她出差了
Her neighbour said that she's away on business?

120
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,320
呃 没错 她本该今天早上回来的
Uh, yeah, she's supposed to be back this morning.

121
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,290
- 我能进去吗 - 可以
- Can I? - Yeah.

122
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,890
谢谢
Thanks.

123
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,270
嘿 宝贝儿 嗨
Hey, sweetheart. Hi.

124
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,970
嘿 我是艾略特叔叔
Hey, it's Uncle Elliott.

125
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,740
你怎么样了
How you doing?

126
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,480
我希望 一些熟人和安慰 或许会让她快点好过来
I'm hoping, with some familiarity and some comfort, that she'll come around soon.

127
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,820
嘿 不会有事的
Hey, it's gonna be OK.

128
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,260
我们有什么线索
So, what do we got?

129
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,290
死者的妻子 那个人权律师
Victim's wife, the human rights lawyer.

130
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,400
- 没错 艾思梅 - 我们拿到了她的旅行记录
- Yeah, Esme. - We got her travel records.

131
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,890
她在刚果待了三周 对吧
She's been in the Congo for three weeks, right?

132
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,370
你说她的航班是今早八点到的
You said her flight arrived at 8am this morning?

133
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,670
- 没错 - 事实并非如此 她的航班是昨天早上八点的
- Yup. - It didn't. Her flight got in at 8am  yesterday morning.

134
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,640
我一个小时前才看见她
I just watched her climb out

135
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,980
从机场豪华轿车上下来 带着行李之类的
of an airport limo an hour ago, luggage and everything.

136
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,470
这么说 除非艾思梅・贝尔克的记录出错了 
Well, either Esme Belk's records are wrong,

137
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,410
不然她肯定在撒谎
or she likes to dabble in deception.

138
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,320
那么过去的二十四小时她在哪儿
Well, where's she's been for the last 24 hours?

139
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,650
- 你去哪儿 - 带她过来
- Where you headed? - To bring her in.

140
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,650
你去吗
Are you going?

141
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,160
搞什么名堂 你们一起工作可你不去
What's the deal? You guys are working together but you're not?

142
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,490
不晓得
I don't know.

143
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,700
他们一起离开了黑文谷
And together they left Valley Haven.

144
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,230
开始了森林之行
They journeyed deep into the woods

145
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,000
穿过冰冷的丛林雪堆
through icy trees and snow drifts,

146
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,800
经过日日夜夜
through day and night,

147
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,710
最终发现了他们仁慈的国王的家
until they finally came upon the home of their benevolent ruler.

148
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,910
他们慢慢走近房子
And they slowly walked up to the house

149
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,550
在敲门之前 他们脱掉雪地鞋 
and took off their snowshoes, leaned 'em up against the wall

150
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,550
并将它们靠墙根摆放好
before knocking on the door.

151
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,490
她怎么样了
How's she doing?

152
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,620
她时不时会用眼神与我交流 但就是不肯讲话
She's making eye contact once in a while, but she's still not talking.

153
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,760
嘿 艾思梅在哪儿 为什么她没有来
Look, where's Esme? Why isn't she here?

154
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,560
据我所知 她正在警局接受调查
As far as I know, she's at headquarters talking to our investigators.

155
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,430
我不想离开奥利维亚
Look, I don't want to leave Olivia,

156
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,000
但是我有...有个工程计划图
but I have this... this work project

157
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,110
原本应该... 一小时前完成的
that was due... about an hour ago.

158
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:10,950
嘿 如果你想离开 没关系的 
Hey, if you need to duck out, it's no trouble at all.

159
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,110
我会陪着她
I'll stay with her.

160
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:18,780
那好吧
OK.

161
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,980
嘿 宝贝儿
Hey, baby.

162
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:24,090
我会很快回来 好吗
I'm gonna be back soon, OK?

163
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,890
有事马上通知我
Call me the minute anything changes.

164
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,490
谢了
Thanks.

165
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,200
艾思梅 你想到有谁可能会杀害
Esme, can you think of anyone who would want to kill

166
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,820
你的丈夫吗
your husband?

167
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,400
我会列个清单给你 请带我去见我女儿
I'll make you a list. Please take me to see my daughter.

168
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,470
还有清单
There's a list?

169
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,540
我会收到死亡恐吓 一年有好几次
I get death threats, a couple a year.

170
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:48,710
大部分是针对我丈夫...或者奥利维亚
Mostly they're aimed at my husband... or Olivia.

171
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,110
如今他们动手了 他们威胁到了你的家人
That's how they do it nowadays; They threaten your family.

172
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,980
我们外出度假的时候 保安也会放假
We go on vacation, security guards go on vacation too.

173
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,050
这么说 你是刚从刚果回来
So, you just got back from the Congo?

174
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,220
是的 为期三周的目击证人采访
Uh, yes. Three weeks of witness interviews there.

175
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,350
他们不愿上海牙法庭 所以我去找他们
They won't go to the Hague, so I go to them.

176
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,350
荷兰城市海牙 国际战犯法庭所在地

177
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,760
在你离开期间 思念奥利维亚吗
Do you miss Olivia when you go away?

178
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,690
当然
Of course.

179
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,130
很久以前 我才终于学会接受
I came to terms a long time ago with the guilt

180
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,660
作为职业母亲与之俱来的那种愧疚that goes hand in hand with being a working mother.

181
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,670
你是何时从刚果回来的
When did you get back from the Congo?

182
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:15,440
我不知道...
I don't know...

183
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,400
你早上遇到我的 九点钟的样子
You saw me this morning, what, 9am?

184
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,570
没错 那你的航班什么时候到达的
Right, but when did your flight arrive?

185
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,140
- 早上八点 - 是今天早上吗
- Eight am. - This morning?

186
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,650
- 是的 - 可是
- Yes. - It's just,

187
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:30,320
你的旅行记录表明你是昨天早上到达的
your travel records state you arrived yesterday morning.

188
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,020
好吧 等等
OK, hang on a sec.

189
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,490
我没有...
I did not...

190
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,160
我整晚都在国宾酒店里
I was at the Ambassador Hotel all night.

191
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,860
2116房间 你可以去问门卫
Room 1126. You can ask the concierge.

192
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,960
好吧 如此来说 你在三周都没见到
OK, so, you fly home after not seeing your daughter

193
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,330
丈夫和女儿的情况下飞回家 却...
and your husband for three weeks, but...

194
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,470
没有马上去见他们
you don't go see them right away?

195
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,570
是的 我的工作很不易 打交道的都是一些战犯
Yes. My work is difficult. I deal with war criminals,

196
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,310
独裁者和受迫害者
dictators, torture victims.

197
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,310
我早已下定决心
I decided a long time ago

198
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,310
我绝不将工作带回家
that I was not going to bring that home to my family,

199
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,310
所以我在国宾酒店待了一晚
so I take a night at the Ambassador

200
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,750
梳理了一下头绪
to clear my head.

201
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,420
你是在指控我谋杀亲夫吗
Are you charging me with my husband's murder?

202
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,430
那么我想见见自己的女儿 就现在
Then I want to see my daughter. Now.

203
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,760
我看看能不能帮上忙
I'll see what I can do.

204
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,270
她在撒谎
She's lying.

205
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,500
- 撒谎不意味就犯法 - 意味着猜测变成现实了
- Lying doesn't mean guilty. - It means shit just got real.

206
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,670
她没有那么大的力气 弄折自己丈夫的手臂
She's not strong enough to break her husband's arms.

207
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,710
但是她的经济条件足以雇人作案
But she's rich enough to pay someone to do it for her.

208
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,560
你这是在干什么
What are you doing?!

209
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,040
不要 不要
No, no, no.

210
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,580
不要 不要
No! No!

211
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,480
不要 不要
No! No!

212
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,620
第一位嫌疑人
Door number one:

213
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:27,150
坦艾民 缅甸国籍
Aye Min Than. Burmese national.

214
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,160
去年往她家客厅窗户里扔了一枚手榴弹
Threw a grenade through her living room window last year.

215
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,090
虽然不是真手榴弹 但还是扔了
Wasn't real, but still.

216
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,100
第二位嫌疑人 戈伦・米洛维奇
Door number Two: Goran Milovic.

217
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,300
塞尔维亚人 几年前在住宅外被捕
A Serbian. He was arrested outside the house

218
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,330
当时艾思梅正为一位克罗地亚叛军领袖辩护
a few years ago when Esme was defending a Croat rebel leader.

219
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,970
他在他们家前院纵火烧树
He set fire to a tree in their front yard.

220
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,240
- 她手头上的案子呢 - 那是第三个嫌疑人:
- What about her current case? - Door number three:

221
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,240
艾尼沃克・阿德伊米 加拿大落地移民
Enioke Adeyemi. He's a landed immigrant,

222
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,510
祖籍刚果民主共和国
originally from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

223
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,450
他的母亲和姐姐都是前儿童军的受害者
His mother and sister were victims of the former child soldier.

224
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,650
艾思梅的辩护方 法西纳・戈翁
Esme's defending, Fasina Gowon.

225
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,750
这家伙在八岁时
The guy was enslaved to the Lord's Resistance

226
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,820
沦为圣主抵抗军的奴隶 期间被洗脑
Army when he was eight, and brainwashed.

227
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:02,890
阿德伊米先生几周前在咖啡厅遇到艾思梅 便对她大吼大叫
Mr. Adeyemi confronted Esme at a café a few weeks ago, started yelling;

228
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,020
当时他携带了把小折刀 但是没有使用
He had a pocket knife on him, but he didn't use it.

229
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:08,190
这些还只是没入狱 也没被驱逐出境的嫌疑人
And these are just the suspects that aren't in jail or deported already.

230
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:12,030
为什么还没带艾思梅・贝尔克去看她的女儿
Why has Esme Belk not been taken to see her daughter?

231
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,530
因为她在撒谎 所以我给她时间
Because she's lying, so I'm stalling to give her time

232
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,810
在里面细想一下监禁的滋味
to ponder what incarceration is gonna look like from the inside.

233
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,670
除非我们控告她 否则我们就得放人
We can't keep her any longer unless we charge her.

234
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,740
你可以让她在去医院的路上好好想想
You can let her ponder on the way to the hospital.

235
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,990
奥利维亚
Olivia?

236
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,660
宝贝儿
Sweetheart?

237
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,170
- 妈妈 - 哦
- Mom. - Oh!

238
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,750
我被尖叫声惊醒
I woke up 'cause there was screaming,

239
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:06,080
我手足无措
and I didn't know what to do,

240
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,820
于是就躲进了被窝里
so I hid under the covers,

241
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:15,320
当我下楼到大厅时 我听到有人像是在跑
and when I walked down the hall, I heard somebody, like, running,

242
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:19,190
接着就听到了关门声...
and I heard the door shut...

243
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,360
于是我了下楼
and then I went down the stairs,

244
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:25,030
我看到...
and I saw...

245
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,900
没事了 没事了
It's OK, it's OK.

246
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:28,700
没事了 宝贝
It's OK, sweetheart.

247
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,070
我太对不起你了
I'm so sorry.

248
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,540
我应该陪在你身边
I should have been there.

249
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:43,100
奥利维亚 你昨晚没有参加你朋友家的彻夜狂欢吗 
Olivia... didn't you go to a sleepover last night?

250
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,010
你爸爸上周给我发短信
Your Daddy texted me

251
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,430
说你受邀参加一个彻夜狂欢派对 你没有去吗
last week that you got invited to a sleepover. You didn't go?

252
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,860
我去了 后来我有点害怕 
I went, except I got scared later,

253
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,370
所以劳伦的爸爸就送我回家了
so Lauren's dad drove me home.

254
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:56,360
奥利维亚 你到家时 你爸爸在哪里
Olivia, when you got home, where was your dad?

255
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,680
看电视
Watching TV.

256
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,530
他把我抱进卧室 还说 "爱你 丽维亚小乖乖"
He tucked me in and said, "Love you, Livia-bug."

257
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:05,350
没事了 小南瓜 不要说了
It's OK, Pumpkin. Shh, shh.

258
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,460
没事了 没事了
It's OK, it's OK.

259
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,010
这么看来 凶手听到奥利维亚下床 
So, the killer heard Olivia get out of bed.

260
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,310
让他很吃惊 随即逃走
It surprised him, and he ran.

261
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,900
- 他原本以为有更多时间 - 更神不知鬼不觉
- He thought he had more time. - And more privacy.

262
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,580
有可能他本不知道奥利维亚在家 
Could be he didn't know Olivia was there,

263
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,590
或者根本不知道奥斯卡有个孩子
or even that Oscar had a kid.

264
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:20,750
抑或是他清楚奥利维亚的安排 知道她不会在家
Or he knew Olivia's schedule and knew she wasn't gonna be at home.

265
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,710
她听到尖叫后被惊醒
And she woke up because she heard him screaming,

266
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,760
这么说他的手臂是在死前被折断的
so his arms were broken before he died.

267
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,580
没错 你要留下来吗
Yup. You sticking around?

268
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,800
恩 再待会儿 
Yeah, for a bit.

269
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,710
我想看看奥利维亚还能不能回忆起什么来
I'm gonna see if Olivia can remember anything else.

270
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,920
- 好吧 - 艾登 等等
- OK. - Aidan, wait.

271
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:36,030
我不想再这样在你身边工作 而不和你搭档
I don't want to go on working near you and not with you,

272
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,660
所以要是我们再也不能搭档了 
so if we can't ever be partners again,

273
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,940
你可以现在就告诉我吗
can you just let me know now?

274
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,580
打扰一下
Excuse me.

275
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,580
噢 你好
Oh, hi.

276
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,580
对不起 我是丹妮拉・雷德利
Sorry. I'm Daniella Ridley,

277
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,510
和警察共事的精神科医生 你是和华莱士家一起的吗
a psychiatrist with the police. Are you with the Wallace family?

278
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,250
对 对 我叫艾略特・贝尔克.
Uh, yeah, yeah, I'm Elliott Belk.

279
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,580
- 你好 - 你好 是艾思梅的哥哥
- Hi. - Hi. Uh, Esme's brother,

280
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,280
奥利维亚的舅舅
uh, Olivia's uncle.

281
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:13,990
- 里面都还好吧 - 嗯
- Everything all right in there? - Well, uh,

282
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,830
奥利维亚睡着了 艾思梅在里面陪她 所以...
Olivia's finally asleep, and Esme's in there with her, so...

283
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,830
好吧 那正好趁现在 我可以问你一些
OK, well, maybe now would be a good time if I could ask you

284
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,830
关于你妹妹和她家人的问题吗
some questions about your sister and her family?

285
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,630
好 当然
Uh, yeah, yeah, sure.

286
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,140
你和奥斯卡亲近吗
Were you and Oscar close?

287
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,570
我可能和奥利维亚最亲近
Well, uh, I was probably closest with Olivia.

288
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,160
艾思梅经常出差 
You know, Esme goes out of town all the time,

289
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,910
奥斯卡晚上又要上课
and Oscar teaches his night classes,

290
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,380
就经常由我来照看奥利维亚
so I end up babysitting for Olivia a fair bit.

291
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,410
她有你陪着真是幸运
Oh. She's lucky to have you.

292
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,580
是吗 我倒不知道
Ah, yeah, I don't know about that.

293
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,390
我们有一个只有我俩才懂的笑话
Um, we have this little inside joke

294
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,520
她不叫我"艾略特叔叔"
where she doesn't call me "Uncle Elliott",

295
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,560
- 而是叫我"不代家叔叔" - "不代家"?
- she calls me "Uncle LPS". - LPS?

296
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,430
就是"不称职代理家长"
Yeah, "Lame Parental Substitute".

297
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:56,530
消灭所有巧克力碎片饼干的总是我
You see, I'm the guy that burns all the chocolate chip cookies,

298
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,800
给她读床前故事的时候 我反而先睡着
and I end up falling asleep while I'm reading her the bedtime stories.

299
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:04,140
艾思梅 待她真的很不错
Esme, uh, Esme's really great with her,

300
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,870
但是 她总是不在家
but, you know, she's gone all the time.

301
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,380
我们还是很为她骄傲的 因为她在外面
We're really proud of her for that, because she's out there,

302
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,750
努力让世界变得更完美
you know, making the world a nicer place to live.

303
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,220
不过 我就不班门弄斧了
But look who I'm talking to, right?

304
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,080
什么意思
Um, what do you mean?

305
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:22,390
你说你是警察局的精神病专家对吗
You said you're a psychiatrist with the police department,

306
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,790
那一定很忙吧
right? That's gotta be really demanding...

307
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,190
在需要的时候和人沟通 帮助他们度过难关
talking to people when they really need you, helping them through tragedy.

308
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:33,130
我...我怎么能和你妹妹
I'm... I'm nowhere near the league

309
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,530
相提并论呢
your sister's in.

310
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,900
艾登 我们刚刚抓到了艾尼沃克・阿德伊米
Aidan, we just picked up Enioke Adeyemi.

311
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,540
那个父母被艾思梅辩护的童子兵杀害的家伙吗
The guy's parents who were killed by the child soldiers she's defending?

312
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,210
- 对 就是他 - 另外两个呢
- Yeah, that's the one. - What about the other two?

313
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,510
其中一个已经逃出国 另外一个死了
Well, it turns out one of them's out of the country, and the other one's dead.

314
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,850
法医从华莱士家的滑门玻璃上
Forensics just lifted Adeyemi's prints

315
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,780
提取到了阿德伊米的指纹
off the sliding glass doors at the Wallace house.

316
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:54,820
在B审讯室
Interrogation Room B.

317
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,950
- 嗨 里奥 你要去哪儿 - 我要跟她走
- Hey, Leo, where are you going? - I'm going with her.

318
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,060
- 你要甩掉我吗 - 给我打电话吧
- Oh, you're dumping me? - Call me sometime.

319
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,060
我在孤儿院长大 然后来到这里
I was raised in an orphanage, and then I come here,

320
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:11,600
然后有了工作 有了朋友
and I am working, and I have friends,

321
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,600
然后我看到了报纸
and then I read the newspaper.

322
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:17,810
法西纳・戈翁 难民 改造后的
Fasina Gowon. Refugee, reformed

323
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:20,480
童子军 一个自由的人
child soldier, a free man.

324
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:24,210
但他杀了我的家人
But he killed my family,

325
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,280
而艾思梅・贝尔克在为他辩护
and Esme Belk is defending him.

326
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,480
每个人应该被公平对待
Everyone deserves a fair trial.

327
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,620
他绝不是受害者
He is no victim.

328
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:34,520
你周三晚上在哪里
Where were you Wednesday night?

329
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,790
我们知道你想跟踪艾思梅
We know you like to follow Esme.

330
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:42,130
好吧 我们知道你跟踪她 你知道她的行程
OK, we know you stalk her, you know her schedule,

331
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,870
你知道她很多事情
you know a lot of things about her.

332
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:48,700
你也会知道什么时候是进去杀她丈夫的最佳时机
You would know when the best time is to go in and kill her husband.

333
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,510
我为什么要杀人呢
Why would I kill someone?

334
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,270
为了让她也体会到失去家人的感觉
To make her know what it feels like to lose family.

335
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,040
我在值班
I was on shift.

336
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:56,510
你可以检查下我车上的GPS导航仪
You can check the GPS in my cab.

337
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,010
- 马上去核实 - 我们已经着手核实了
- Verify with dispatch. - We're doing that already.

338
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:02,380
好吧 你们听好了
OK, you listen now.

339
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,720
我越跟踪艾思梅・贝尔克
The more I follow Esme Belk,

340
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,520
我越了解到她不是什么好人
the more I know she is not a good person.

341
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:12,220
你们都觉得这个女人是个优秀的人权律师 是个圣人
You all think that this woman is a good human rights lawyer, that she is a saint,

342
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:15,290
但你们并不了解她
but you don't know her.

343
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,330
你们不了解她
You don't know her.

344
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,330
艾尼沃克
Enioke.

345
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,770
我们不了解她什么
What don't we know?

346
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,350
- 不好意思 是阿利斯泰尔・科普兰德吗 - 是我
- Excuse me. Alistair Coupland? - Yes.

347
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,740
我是都市警察局的艾登・布莱克警探 
I'm Detective Aidan Black. I'm with the Metro Police.

348
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,160
怎么了
What's going on?

349
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,560
你知道奥斯卡・华莱士被谋杀了吗
Are you aware that Oscar Wallace was found murdered?

350
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:43,430
知道 整个学院都很悲痛
Yes, the entire faculty is devastated.

351
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,900
你知道他的妻子艾思梅
Did you know that his wife Esme

352
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,300
被一个刚果来的男人跟踪吗
was being stalked by a man from the Congo?

353
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,530
知道
Yes.

354
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,970
我们问过这个男人 他告诉我们
We spoke with this man, and he told us

355
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,340
不管她何时出差回来
that you pick her up at the airport

356
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,340
你都会去机场接她
whenever she returns home from a business trip?

357
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,440
你周三晚上和她一起 呆在国宾酒店吗 
Were you with her at the Ambassador Hotel on Wednesday night?

358
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,950
是的 不要让我妻子知道好吗
Yes. Can we not involve my wife in this?

359
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,920
你怎么认识艾思梅的
How did you meet Esme?

360
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,880
在几年前的一个学院聚会上
A holiday faculty party a couple years ago.

361
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,290
对 她出差回来之后
And, yeah, we get together

362
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,420
我们一起在大使酒店相聚
at the Ambassador when she comes home from a trip.

363
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:16,930
- 周三晚上呢 - 我十二点半左右离开的
- And Wednesday night? - I left around 12:30.

364
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,690
我第二天在圭尔夫市有个会议 
I had a conference in Guelph the next day...

365
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:20,230
路很远 要早起
long drive, early start.

366
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,800
你们可以问大楼的看门人
You can talk to my doorman at the building.

367
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,630
他可以确认
He'll confirm it.

368
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,340
所以你不知道艾思梅十二点半之后去哪里了吗
So you don't know where Esme was after 12:30?

369
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,600
艾思梅是个好人
Esme is a good person.

370
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,610
她很复杂 没错
She's complicated, yes,

371
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:35,210
但她敢做那些常人不理会的事
but she does things not everybody agrees with.

372
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,650
她不会杀人
She wouldn't kill someone.

373
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:40,110
她绝对不可能杀奥斯卡
She sure as hell wouldn't kill Oscar.

374
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,850
怎么说呢 艾思梅从小优生惯养
Well, what can I tell you? Esme grew up privileged...

375
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,020
玩的都是滑雪 帆船 骑马
downhill skiing, yachting, horseback riding,

376
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:52,060
上的是最好的私立学校
the best private schools.

377
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,890
艾思梅和你父母的关系如何
What was Esme's relationship like with your parents?

378
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,960
不错 对 不错
Good. Yeah, it was good.

379
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:01,530
具体是什么情况
Um, and what do you mean by "good"?

380
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,040
说实话
Um... to be honest with you,

381
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:08,040
我 具体不清楚
I, uh, heh, I don't know exactly.

382
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,680
艾思梅和我 并不是一块长大的
You see, Esme and I didn't grow up together.

383
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,300
我八岁的时候 
When I was eight years old, my father shipped

384
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,880
父亲把我送去了瑞士的寄宿学校
me off to boarding school in Switzerland.

385
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:17,280
八岁 也太小了吧
At eight? That's very young.

386
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:21,220
是啊 我父亲不允许不优秀的存在
Yeah. Yeah, my father wouldn't accept anything less than excellence.

387
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:23,990
你觉得艾思梅达到他的期望了吗
Do you think Esme fulfilled his expectations?

388
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,620
反正她没被送去瑞士的寄宿学校
She didn't get sent to boarding school in Switzerland.

389
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:29,660
我不知道
I don't know.

390
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:33,570
事实上我有三十年没和艾思梅接触过了
You know, I've had virtually no contact with Esme for 30 years.

391
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:36,770
你三十年都没回过家吗
You never came back to your home for 30 years?

392
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,940
没有 毕业之后 我四处旅行
Mmmmm. No, after school, I travelled around for a bit,

393
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,940
最近的十年我都在各地工作
and I've travelled with work for the last 10 years.

394
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:44,910
那你到底有多了解她
How well would you say you know her, then?

395
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:51,480
还可以 听着 医生 为什么要问我这么多关于艾思梅的事
Pretty well. Look, Doc, why all these questions about Esme?

396
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:54,620
抱歉 我们必须搞清楚
I'm sorry, we have to be very thorough.

397
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:58,220
好吧 听着 我得回去看看奥利维亚
OK. Look, I should get back to Olivia.

398
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,020
好 当然 谢谢你
Yes, of course. Thank you.

399
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,020
没事 抱歉
Yeah. Excuse me.

400
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,460
好了 来吧 看奥斯卡・华莱士的通话记录
All right, here we go. Oscar Wallace's phone records.

401
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:09,200
这是艾思梅的电话
Esme's number.

402
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,600
好吧 他经常给艾思梅打电话 但是
All right, well, he called Esme a lot, but...

403
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,940
还有一个号码他上周也打得很勤
there's another number here he called a whole bunch in the last week.

404
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:20,380
他的办公室吗
His office?

405
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,410
奥斯卡也有个情人吗
Oscar had a lover of his own?

406
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,780
或者他在调查她的情人 
Or he was on to hers.

407
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,050
这些电话都是打给一个叫卡斯帕的私人侦探
All these calls are to a private investigator. Kasper.

408
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,150
他在为离婚收集证据吗
He's gathering evidence for a divorce case?

409
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,990
收集你老婆和别人勾搭的照片 时机刚好
Getting photos of your wife hooking up with someone else. Good times.

410
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:34,960
所以如果他打算跟她离婚 而她发现
So if he was preparing to divorce her, she finds out...

411
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:38,490
- 他想要监护权 - 唔 动机来了
- He wants custody. - Boom. Motive.

412
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,600
不好意思
Excuse me.

413
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:47,530
我是艾登・布莱克警探 这位是丹妮拉・雷德利
I'm Detective Aidan Black. This is Daniella Ridley.

414
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,700
- 你是卡斯帕吗 - 啊 不 不是
- Are you Kasper? - Uh, no, no,

415
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:52,170
- 我是卡斯帕的助理 - 卡斯帕在楼上吗
- I'm Kasper's assistant. - Is Kasper upstairs?

416
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,410
- 他今天不在这儿 - 哦 也许你可以协助我们
- He's not here today. - Well, maybe you could help us.

417
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,410
我们在查找一些信息
We're looking for some information.

418
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,810
卡斯帕有个客户叫做奥斯卡・华莱士
Kasper has a client named Oscar Wallace.

419
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,780
很抱歉 我不能透露有关客户的信息
I'm sorry, I really can't talk about clients.

420
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:04,220
要是我告诉你奥斯卡・华莱士死了呢
What if I told you Oscar Wallace was dead?

421
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,490
他在昨天被人谋杀了
He was murdered yesterday.

422
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,720
奥斯卡的案子是不是和偷情有关
Was Oscar's case about infidelity?

423
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,960
奥斯卡・华莱士是不是怀疑他妻子背着他偷情呢
Did Oscar Wallace believe his wife was cheating on him?

424
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,120
我... 我不知道 我对这个案子真的
I... I don't know. I really don't know anything

425
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,630
什么也不知道 是卡斯帕负责接待华莱士的 所以...
about the case. Kasper was dealing with Wallace, so...

426
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:17,600
我们在哪可以找到卡斯帕
Where can we find Kasper?

427
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,700
他按说今天早上要过来的
Well, he was supposed to be here this morning

428
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:20,900
主持一些会议 但他没出现
to take some meetings, but he never showed,

429
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:22,770
而且现在他连电话也不接了
and now he's not answering his cell phone.

430
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:25,070
所以很奇怪 还有 唔...
So that's weird, and, uh...

431
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,410
我现在正准备去他家
I was just heading over to his house right now.

432
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:31,410
好的 唔... 要不我让你们进去吧
OK, shit, um... why don't I let you in?

433
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,780
在卡斯帕的办公室里有个档案盒
There's a case box in Kasper's office.

434
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:37,450
我知道你对翻看大堆的文件资料情有独钟
I know you've got a soft spot for overwhelming paperwork.

435
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,920
- 太好了 太谢谢你了 - 好吧 嘿 伙计
- Great. Thank you so much. - All right, hey, man,

436
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,950
你一把她安顿好了 就马上下来吧
when you're done setting her up, come on back down.

437
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,890
我要跟着你去你老板的家 怎么样
I'm gonna follow you to your boss' house, all right?

438
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,920
我在车站等你
I'll meet you at the station.

439
00:25:56,530 --> 00:26:00,140
艾略特・贝尔克 三十五年前
E. Belk. Thirty-five years ago.

440
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,540
艾略特 你知道吗
Elliott, do you know

441
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:11,150
- 你为什么在这里吗 - 我爸爸送我来的
- why you're here? - 'Cause my dad made me come.

442
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:14,420
- 他为啥送你过来 - 因为他找到了那些鞋盒
- Why did he make you come? - 'Cause he found the shoeboxes.

443
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,550
- 那些鞋盒里有什么 - 一些鸟
- And what was in them? - Birds.

444
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,520
你是怎么把它们都抓进那里面的
How did you get them in there?

445
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:22,860
呃 我对抓东西挺在行的
Well, I'm really good at catching things.

446
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,490
我能不发出一点声音地走过去 我还可以...
I can sneak up really quiet, and I can...

447
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,500
抓住它们
just grab them.

448
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,300
你又是怎么弄伤它们的呢
How did you hurt them?

449
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:33,930
我抓住它们的翅膀然后...
I take their wings and...

450
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,370
好的 好的 明白 我知道了
OK, OK, yeah, got it.

451
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,070
艾登刚从私家侦探家里回来
Aidan just got back from the PI's house.

452
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,080
他在那找到了一个香港发来的文件
He found a file there from Hong Kong.

453
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,210
很明显  艾略特・贝尔克几年前在那里被抓了
Apparently, Elliott Belk was arrested there a few years ago.

454
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,710
等等  是艾略特・贝尔克
Wait, Elliott Belk?

455
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,880
对的 私家侦探并没有在调查艾思梅通奸的事
Yeah. The PI wasn't investigating Esme for adultery;

456
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,350
他是在调查她的哥哥
He was investigating her brother.

457
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,490
我听说你上周折断了些
I was told you broke some bigger bones

458
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,790
- 更大的骨头 - 是艾思梅的
- last weekend. - Esme's.

459
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,230
又是艾思梅 她还只是个婴儿啊
Esme's too? She's practically a baby.

460
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:03,830
- 你为什么要伤害她 - 啊
- Why did you hurt her? - Ah!

461
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:07,060
我只是在检查她的手臂 我想这么做
I was looking at her arm. And I wanted to.

462
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:09,470
她哭了
She cried.

463
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:12,600
- 现在 你是什么感觉 - 我很喜欢
- Now, how did that make you feel? - I liked it.

464
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,180
是的 我记得艾略特・贝尔克
Yes, I remember Elliott Belk.

465
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,550
他不是个你能轻易忘记的人
He's not a man you easily forget.

466
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:24,720
- 他被怀疑犯了什么罪 - 一级谋杀罪
- What was he suspected of? - First-degree murder.

467
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:25,770
那是五年前
It was about five years ago.

468
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,170
受害者是贝尔克先生的合作者之一
The victim was one of Mr. Belk's coworkers,

469
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:32,240
他在参加CXB银行的高管庆祝晚会后被杀了
And he was killed after a party for CXB Bank executives.

470
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,480
宋警官 你们当时怎么追查到贝尔克的呢
Detective Sung, what led you guys to pursue Belk?

471
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,010
他出席了那个晚会
He attended the party,

472
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,350
然后大楼监控录像也有拍到他
and he was caught on building security cameras

473
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,480
跟随受害者出了门
following the vicitim outside.

474
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,050
但最后 我们没有足够的物证去指控他
In the end, we did not have sufficient physical evidence to charge.

475
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,960
我们很想看看你的档案
We'd be really interested to look at your files.

476
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,230
要是能帮上你们 当然可以
If it will help, absolutely.

477
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:13,110
嘿 雷德利
Hey, Ridley.

478
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,480
我们在卡斯帕家里的桌上找到了一些文件
So, we found some papers in Kasper's desk at home.

479
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,520
看起来艾略特到处流窜啊...
Looks like Elliott bounced around a lot...

480
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,690
瑞士 香港 罗马 伦敦
Switzerland, Hong Kong, Rome, London.

481
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,650
他在苏黎世有段两年的婚姻 期间多次
He was married for two years in Zurich, had a couple

482
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,290
被指控使用家庭暴力 但后来就都不了了之了
of domestic violence charges, but those were dropped.

483
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,290
雷德利 不管怎样 回头打给我
Anyway, Ridley, call me back.

484
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,130
里奥
Leo.

485
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,770
- 嘿 雷德利 - 啊 不 我是达米安
- Hey, Ridley. - Uh, no, it's Damian.

486
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,800
你怎么用雷德利医生的电话
Why are you calling me

487
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:39,340
打给我 她人在哪儿
from Dr. Ridley's phone? Where is she?

488
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,870
我不知道 呃 她的东西和钱包都在这儿 
I don't know. Uh, her things and her purse are here,

489
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,770
唯独华莱士的档案不见了
but the Wallace files are gone.

490
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,940
香港发来的犯罪现场照片
Crime scene photo from Hong Kong.

491
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,570
啊
Ugh!

492
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:20,210
- 啊 啊 - 救命
- Ugh! Ugh! - Help!

493
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,430
警官 这里还有很多
Inspector, there are more.

494
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,900
1999年在沙夫豪森 一个死在出租住房里的流浪者
Schaffhausen, '99. A drifter found dead in a rooming house.

495
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,900
沙夫豪森 瑞士境内靠近德国边界的一个小镇

496
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,900
艾略特・贝尔克当时就住在那里
Elliott Belk was living there at the time.

497
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,910
2001年在巴勒莫 英国游客
Palermo, 2001. A British tourist

498
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,910
巴勒莫 西西里首府

499
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,580
被发现死在以艾略特名字登记的旅馆房内
found dead in a hotel room under Elliott's name.

500
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,380
他们两人的手臂都被折断了
Both of them had their arms broken.

501
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,150
我们知道的还只是一小部分
And these are just a few that we know about.

502
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,380
你也许可以把私家侦探加上去
You might as well add that private investigator to the list.

503
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:39,750
我们在想艾略特回到卡斯帕的办公室
We're thinking Elliott went back to Kasper's office

504
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,540
去处理任何收集到的对他不利的证据 
to get rid of any evidence collected against him,

505
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,020
却发现丹妮拉在那里
found Daniella there.

506
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,990
总之 我们对艾略特就知道这些
So, this is what we know about Elliott:

507
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,990
他喜欢把活人的手臂折断
He likes to break people's arms while they're still alive,

508
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,060
这让他成为一个施虐狂 也就是说
which probably makes him a sadist, which means

509
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:51,660
他看着他的受害者们受苦而感到兴奋
he gets a thrill from seeing his victims in pain,

510
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:54,860
所以他会让丹妮拉活着直到他感受到那种刺激
so he'll want to see Daniella alive until he gets that thrill.

511
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:57,270
要是她没能给他那种刺激呢
What if she doesn't give it to him?

512
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:00,900
如果说有人知道如何对付艾略特这样的人 那一定是丹妮拉
Well, if anybody knows how to handle a guy like Elliott, it's Daniella.

513
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:03,040
不管她面临多大的恐惧或者承受多大的痛苦
No matter how afraid she is or how much pain she's in,

514
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,910
她都会尽可能的坚持下去
she'll hold off as long as she can.

515
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:29,460
这是哪里
What is this place?

516
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:36,140
你喜欢看这些吗
Did you enjoy watching these?

517
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,070
不喜欢 但它们能帮助我明白些事
No, but they helped me understand.

518
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,040
帮助你明白什么
Helped you understand what?

519
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:46,040
明白了你的父母把你送走是为了保护艾思梅
That your parents sent you away to protect Esme.

520
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,680
也是为了躲着我
And kept me away.

521
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:55,120
其实从我在寄宿学校以名列前百分之五的成绩毕业后
After I graduated in the top 5% of boarding school,

522
00:31:55,190 --> 00:32:00,990
我父亲就给我钱让我别再回家了
my father actually paid me to keep me from coming back home.

523
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:04,000
五年前 我错过了我母亲的葬礼
Five years ago, I missed my mother's funeral.

524
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:08,600
大约一年以前 我痛下决心
About a year ago, I made sure

525
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:11,470
会参加他的葬礼
to come back for his.

526
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:14,270
他现在估计在坟墓里也要气炸了
He's probably rolling over in his grave.

527
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,540
但我可以告诉你休想伤害艾思梅和奥利维亚
But I can tell you don't plan to hurt Esme and Olivia.

528
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:24,580
医生 你怎么能这么说呢
How can you tell that, Doc?

529
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:27,350
因为我还相信你愿意拥有亲人
Because I think you like having a family.

530
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:31,590
我还相信你愿意拥有那些欣赏你的人
I think you like having people who admire you.

531
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,730
那能让你感觉自己很正常 感到内心的和谐 
I think it makes you feel normal, makes you blend in.

532
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,630
你为什么杀了奥斯卡
Why did you kill Oscar?

533
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,300
噢 奥斯卡
Oh, Oscar.

534
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:46,870
他看到奥利维亚这么快就喜欢上我所以嫉妒了
He got jealous that Olivia started to love me so quickly,

535
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,040
所以他请了个私家侦探尽可能地
so he hired a private investigator to try

536
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:53,540
去挖出任何东西把我从我妹妹身边赶走
and dig up anything he can to try and squeeze me out of my sister's life.

537
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:59,880
我本打算把他埋在屋后的山上 但是...
I was gonna bury him on the hill behind the house, but...

538
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:02,080
你根本没回答我的问题
You never answered my question.

539
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:04,090
这是什么地方
What is this place?

540
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:06,390
这是我家
It's home.

541
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,490
你八岁之前的家
Until you were eight?

542
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,600
是的 我们一家在那住还不到十年
Yeah. It hasn't been in my family for decades,

543
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,770
但是 唔...
but, uh...

544
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:25,670
我很幸运 那个主人...死了
fortunately enough for me, the owner... died.

545
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,940
从我离开这里后
You know, after I left here,

546
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:32,210
我...我一直和自己做斗争
I... I tried to fight the urges.

547
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:36,280
是的 我大多数时候还是表现不错的
Yeah, I did pretty well for the most part.

548
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,350
但要自己装作
But it's just not easy

549
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,760
别的谁确实不容易啊
pretending to be somebody that you're not.

550
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,390
医生 对吗
Is it, Doc?

551
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,870
回家的感觉太好了
It feels so good to be home.

552
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:01,740
雷德利医生 我想让你看看奥斯卡・华莱士的私家侦探
Doctor Ridley, I'd like you to meet Oscar Wallace's snoop.

553
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,150
从小到大 别人一直跟我说艾略特很聪明
All my life, I was told that Elliott was smart

554
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,920
很特别 他只是...
and special, and that he was just...

555
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:12,830
没有上学 所以当我父亲去世时
away at school, so when my father died,

556
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:16,330
我... 我窃喜他又回到我身边来
I just... I was happy to have him back in my life.

557
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,330
我是说 你对我讲的这些 我不能...
I mean, what you're saying to me, I can't...

558
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,370
- 我是说... - 好了 艾思梅 我明白了
- I mean... - OK, Esme, I get it,

559
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:24,970
但是能否想一下 艾略特有没有提过
but just think for a second. Has Elliott mentioned any place

560
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,970
在他公寓附近 有没有他喜欢去的地方
beside his condo that he likes to go?

561
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,870
没有
No.

562
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,180
小木屋 储藏室... 或者其他地方
A cottage, storage space... anything.

563
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,980
他总是给我讲一个有关城堡的故事
He tells me stories about a castle.

564
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:36,180
- 奥利维亚 - 城堡
- Olivia... - A castle?

565
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,710
一个男孩和一个女孩住在那儿 
About a boy and girl who live there.

566
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,580
他们经常在森林里冒险
They go on adventures in the woods.

567
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,350
他们穿着雪地靴
They wear snowshoes.

568
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,260
穿雪地靴的男孩和女孩
A boy and a girl snowshoeing.

569
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,990
我知道在哪儿了
I know where that is.

570
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,430
在米都维尔小巷十四号
The address is 14 Meadowvale Lane,

571
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,900
我想你肯定知道如果你被判施虐罪
I'm assuming you know what will happen to you if you get convicted

572
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:03,040
会有什么后果
of a crime involving sadism.

573
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,870
我当然知道
Of course I do.

574
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,880
但我不会被抓
But I'm not getting caught.

575
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,940
但是有可能
But you might.

576
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,480
好吧 万一被抓了
Oh, well, in that case,

577
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,620
我无需负法律责任
I would be found not criminally responsible,

578
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,750
我可能被送到某个悠闲的地方
I'd be sent to some cushy facility somewhere

579
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:20,460
跟别人围坐着聊天
where I would sit around in a circle and talk

580
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,160
谈论我本不该做的事情...
about how I shouldn't have done what I did and...

581
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,890
...然后去吃个午饭
...then I'd go have lunch.

582
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:29,260
但那根本不可能 艾略特
But that's not going to happen, Elliott.

583
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:32,030
你精神没有问题
You're not mentally ill.

584
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,170
你没有病
You don't have a disease.

585
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,140
没有药能改变你的行为
No amount of medication is ever gonna change your behaviour.

586
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:41,240
可能三十年后你会被送到那种悠闲的地方
Maybe 30 years ago you would have been sent to a facility like that,

587
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:44,040
但现在像你这样的人只能进监狱
but now they just send people like you to jail.

588
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:49,050
我要是没病 那我为什么这样
Well, if I'm not ill, then what am I?

589
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,150
你就是内心邪恶罢了
You're just bad.

590
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,060
你不能有点新意吗 医生
You don't have any fancier words for me, Doc?

591
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,060
可以
No, I do.

592
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:01,390
虐待狂 精神病患
Sadist. Psychopath.

593
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,200
怪物
Monster.

594
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,770
我这样待你的时候 希望能听到你的尖叫
I want you to scream when I do this to you.

595
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:14,670
我不会让你得逞的
I'm not gonna help you enjoy this.

596
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,480
你会的
Oh, yes, you will.

597
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,220
噢 不对我叫是吗
Oh, you're not gonna scream for me?

598
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,630
你想把我怎么样 像对别人一样掰断我的胳膊
What are you gonna do, break my arms like you did the others?

599
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,800
因为他们会让你想起小鸟折断翅膀的声音
'Cause they remind you of birds' wings?

600
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,810
我喜欢听那种声音
I like the sound that it makes.

601
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,210
来嘛
Now, come on.

602
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,550
让我听听你的尖叫
Let me hear you scream.

603
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:00,480
- 快叫 - 警察 艾略特
- Scream for me! - Police! Elliott!

604
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:04,320
别动 把刀放下 
Don't move! Drop the knife, man!

605
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:06,560
放下你的枪 否则你知道我会怎么做
You drop your gun. You know what I'll do.

606
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:10,490
我不会放下枪 我们来谈谈
I'm not dropping this gun. You and I, we're gonna talk.

607
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,690
没什么好谈的
No talking.

608
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,960
给我
Give it to me!

609
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:18,100
快点 放下武器
Do it now! Drop that weapon!

610
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,270
你把枪放下
You drop the gun.

611
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:40,390
好的 好的
All right, all right, all right, all right.

612
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:42,490
我把枪放下
I'm gonna put the gun down.

613
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,560
你想要怎样 伙计
What do you need, man?

614
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:52,430
你想离开这里 要开我的车吗
You want to get out of here? You want my car?

615
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,200
我给你钥匙 你要什么我都给你
I'll give you the keys, I'll slide'em over, whatever you need.

616
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:57,800
我要你闭嘴 把枪踢过来
I need you to shut up and kick the gun over here.

617
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:59,810
快点 现在
Do it! Now!

618
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:02,940
好的 好的
All right, all right.

619
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:14,350
- 啊
- Ugh!

620
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:19,560
- 把他抓起来 - 丹妮拉 我是里奥
- Tag 'em, tag 'em. - Daniella, it's Leo.

621
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,390
我是里奥 你现在安全了 没事了
It's Leo. You're safe now. You're safe.

622
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,890
你还好吗
You OK?

623
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,830
雷德利 还好吗
Ridley, you OK?

624
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:30,070
怎么样 嘿 里奥 叫救援队过来
You OK? Are you OK? Hey, Leo, call it in.

625
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,800
没事了 你安全了 你安全了
It's OK. Hey, you're safe, you're safe, you're safe.

626
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:36,940
我是里奥・贝克特 和罪案心理分析科一起
OK. This is Leo Beckett with Psych Crimes.

627
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:39,010
我需要护理人员 在米都维尔小巷十四号
I need paramedics at 14 Meadowvale Lane.

628
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,510
嫌疑犯中枪了
Suspect's been shot.

629
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,050
我觉得他挺不过去了
I don't think he's gonna make it.

630
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:03,200
# 暴风雨即将来袭 #
A storm is coming

631
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:09,770
# 而我心平静 #
But I don't mind

632
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:15,080
# 人之将死 #
People are dying

633
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:21,280
# 我双眸轻闭 #
I close my blinds

634
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:27,690
# 只知晓 我仍在呼吸 #
All that I know is I'm breathing now

635
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:37,360
他们说我们无法掌控会发生什么事
They say that we can't control the things that happen to us,

636
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:40,600
但我们可以学会怎样去面对
but we can control the way we react to them.

637
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:43,570
我觉得"他们"错了
I say "they" are wrong,

638
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,910
因为没人控制得了创伤后应激障碍
'cause no one can control PTSD.

639
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:48,370
它只是做了你的心中所想
It just does what it wants to you.

640
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:52,080
但第二次在千钧一发之际幻觉重现时
But I can control how I react to the knowledge

641
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:56,520
我能控制住自己 知道该如何应对
that for the second time I had a flashback in a critical situation.

642
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,190
我的搭档身陷险境
My partner's life was at risk.

643
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:03,620
艾登 这次你产生了幻觉
Aidan, this time you had a flashback,

644
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:06,930
但你没有失控 你仍保持清醒
you didn't lose touch. You kept a clear head,

645
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,290
你明白了丹妮拉的暗示
you read Daniella's signals,

646
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,030
尽管你的每个细胞都叫嚣着
you did something

647
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:15,030
但你做了你该做的...
that every fibre in your body was telling you not to do...

648
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,900
你放下了枪
you put down your gun.

649
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:22,210
你没有单凭策略来做决定
And you didn't make those decisions through strategy.

650
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:25,980
这也体现了你的胆量和责任
It was also your gut and your trust.

651
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,710
你们心意相通 成功完成了任务
You did it with empathy and you got the job done.

652
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,710
这不是劫数
This is not doom

653
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:35,650
而是进步
This is progress.

654
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:42,390
现在 你...很称职
Now, you... are supposed to be here.

655
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:47,000
现在 回去好好工作吧
Now, please, get your ass back to work.

656
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:50,700
# 我只能静静呼吸 #
All I can do is keep breathing

657
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:53,970
破碎的信任感很难修复
Broken trust isn't easily mended.

658
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,670
这种感觉打心底儿感到可怕
It's just this awful feeling in the pit of my stomach.

659
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,710
- 这需要时间 - 嘿
- It's gonna take time. - Hey.

660
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,780
只有一种方法能消除隔阂
There's only one way to kill it.

661
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:04,810
我们再搭档一次吧
Let's try again.

662
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,950
# 我们只能静静呼吸 #
All we can do is keep breathing

663
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,480
好啊
OK.

664
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:14,620
# 我们只能静静呼吸 #
All we can do is keep breathing

665
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:16,890
这工作还真不赖
There's a lot of good in this job,

666
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,130
能有机会改变人们的生活
a chance to make a difference in people's lives,

667
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:21,360
但也有不少坏处
but there's a lot of bad too.

668
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:23,530
那个绑架我搭档的匪徒
The guy who kidnapped my partner,

669
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,400
就是个彻头彻尾的混蛋
he's a bad guy through and through.

670
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:31,240
那么 你最近觉得坏的一面远超过好的一面吗
So, do you feel lately the bad has eclipsed the good?

671
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:34,370
黑暗总比光明多 是这样吗
That there's more darkness than light?

672
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,540
# 我们只能静静呼吸 #
All we can do is keep breathing

673
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:41,010
我不知道 我是说...与坏处相比 
I don't know, I mean... anything good

674
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,450
好处看起来总是...
just seems so...

675
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,650
那么渺小
small in comparison to all the bad

676
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,190
我...好不容易才看清这一点
that I... have a hard time seeing it.

677
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:53,060
布莱克警探
Detective Black.

678
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:00,400
好的
Yup.

679
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,200
好的 谢谢
OK, thank you.

680
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,540
艾略特死在医院了
Elliott died in hospital.

681
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:20,520
你看到的比一般人要多 艾登
You see more than most people, Aidan.

682
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:24,960
坏事发生在你身边 甚至就发生在你身上
Bad things happen near you, to you,

683
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:28,960
但是好事因你而发生
but good things happen because of you.

684
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:35,530
你想过也许这两方面源自同一种情感吗
Do you ever think maybe good and bad are part of the same single feeling?

685
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,400
怎么称呼这种情感呢
What would you call that feeling?

686
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:40,500
整体感
A sense of wholeness.

687
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:58,800
本季已完结 感谢大家对此剧的支持
