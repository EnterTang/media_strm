雷德利医生在您面前
What kinds of things

9
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,430
是怎样评价布莱克警官的
would Dr. Ridley tell you about Detective Black?

10
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,570
她会定期向我汇报艾登的心理状态
She would keep me apprised of Aidan's state of mind.

11
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,440
- 艾登 - 艾登 等等
- Aidan... - Aidan, wait!

加利格拉很担心你 
Caligra was worried about you.

13
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,540
所以让我帮忙留意一下
She asked me to keep an eye on you.

14
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,630
我起初这么做是为了我们小组 
I did it for the unit in the beginning,

15
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:27,410
后来是为了你
and then I did it for you.

16
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,150
我不能忍受了
I can't do this anymore.

19
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,420

- Poppy, you're with Daniella. - What?!

20
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:41,190
- 那你想要什么 - 孩子
- So what do you want? - A child.

21
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,660
你的儿子
Your son.

22
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,760
我当初不该放弃他
I never should've given him up.

23
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,430
有伏击 走 趴下 趴下
It's an ambush! Go! Get down! Get down!

24
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,870
趴下 趴下
Get down! Get down!

25
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,500
趴下 趴下 别进去 不要
Get down! Get down! Don't go back inside, no!

26
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,840
不 别进去
No! Don't go inside

27
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,930
# 我今早起床 #
I got out of bed today

28
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,000
# 对上帝发誓 我看不见我的脸 #
Swear to God, couldn't see my face

29
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,570
# 我今早起床 #
I got out of bed today

30
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,740
# 注视着一缕灵魂 #
Staring at a ghost

31
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,570
# 你看到我的灵魂了吗 #
Oh have you seen my ghost

32
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,410
# 看到了吗 看到了吗 #
Seen my ghost, seen my ghost

33
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,110
# 哦 你看到我的灵魂了吗 #
Oh have you seen my ghost

34
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,980
# 它凝视着地面 #
Staring at the ground

心灵缉凶 第一季第12集

36
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,130
抱歉
Sorry.

37
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,800
- 嘿 - 嘿 是你啊
- Hey. - Hey there.

38
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,930
- 我没打给你 - 你本该打来的
- I didn't call. - You should have.

39
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,300
我这段时间一直在忙工作的事
I've been busy at work.

40
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,950
我非常肯定我们在同一栋楼上班
I'm pretty sure we workin the same building.

41
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:51,040
- 我一直想打给你来着 - 别这样 热情一点嘛
- I've been meaning to. - Please just don't try and be sweet.

42
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,940
- 不知道怎么做 - 学学就会了
- Wouldn't know how. - Maybe you could learn.

43
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,310
每当我跟你说话
That thing you do where I say something

44
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,150
你针锋相对地反驳我的样子 我挺喜欢
and you turn it around and you stick it to me? I like that.

45
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,050
很好
Good.

46
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,990
那我们约个时间坐一坐 你什么时候有空
So let's set this up. When are you free?

47
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:06,720
哦 见鬼 忘记给手机充电了
Aw, shit. I forgot to plug my phone in.

48
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,720
昨晚整夜没睡 搬家具
Was up all night. Moving furniture.

49
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,630
当然 不然你还可能干嘛 还是睡不着吗
Of course. What else could you be doing? Still not sleeping?

50
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,400
见鬼 一小时前有人打电话找我
Damn it. I went on call an hour ago.

51
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,900
- 可你没在 - 我要走了
- Only it turns out you weren't. - I gotta go.

52
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,830
哦...
Yeah...

53
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,000
慢着
Not so fast.

54
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,240
我的电话
My number.

55
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,680
别让汗水给洗掉了
Don't sweat that off.

56
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,950
祝你愉快
Have a good one.

57
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,930
- 睡过头了 - 我也想啊
- Sleep in? - I wish.

58
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,380
手机没电了 什么情况
My phone died. What's up?

59
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,640
四个家伙闯进这家珠宝店行窃 前后不到十分钟
Four guys blew in and out of this jewelry store in like less than a minute.

60
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,580
太牛了
Impressive.

61
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,200
看上去不值得啊 他们盗的货价值多少
Hardly looks worth it. How much did they get?

62
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,340
还不清楚 珠宝店老板正在路上
Don't know yet. Jewelry store owner's on his way down.

63
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,370
貌似是保险柜里的东西被盗了
It looks like whatever was in the safe.

64
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,220
那把我们召集过来做什么 
So why were we called in?

65
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,230
协助盗窃侦破组
Special request from Robbery Squad.

66
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,120
似乎是有个罪犯发疯了 
Apparently one of the guys goes nuts,

67
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,890
袭击了一位女性路人
he attacks a female bystander,

68
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:08,730
然后开始朝天开枪 
starts shooting in the air.

69
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,620
他的同伙只好把他拖走
His partners had to haul him off of her.

70
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,510
受害者在哪儿
Where is she now?

71
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,920
圣・斯蒂芬医院 丹妮拉和波比去找她谈话了
St. Stephens. Daniella and Poppy they're headed down there to talk to her.

72
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,860
我们掌握了哪些线索
What have we got?

73
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,860
使用了非常先进的爆炸装置
Some pretty elite explosive use.

74
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,860
锥形装药 破坏极小
Shaped charges, minimum damage.

75
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,860
连展示柜都没震碎
They didn't even break the display cases.

76
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,870
- 厉害 - 很厉害
- Pros. - Good ones.

77
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,170
实在太厉害了
I mean really good.

78
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,400
我当时很害怕 以为他要开枪杀我
I was terrified. I thought he was going to shoot me.

79
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,770
你可以给我们描述下当时的场景吗
Can you take us through what happened?

80
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,870
他们出来时我正在家门口
I was at my door when they all came out.

81
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,920
他们带着面具 应该有辆货车 然后他看见我了
They had masks. There was a van, I think. And then he saw me.

82
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,260
一个盗贼
One of the robbers?

83
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,450
他正四周环视 然后就看到了我 他就...
He was looking all around and then he saw me. And he just...

84
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,090
我想开门进去 但他把我撞倒了
I tried to get inside, but he knocked me down.

85
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,020
他压住我 朝天开枪 
He got on top of me. He was shooting,

86
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,290
然后他的同伙把他拉走了
and then the other men pulled him off.

87
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,050
他们知道他疯掉了 
He was crazy, they knew it.

88
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,860
他们把他往车里塞的时候 他一个劲儿的挣扎
They put him in the van, he was struggling.

89
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,790
你可以给我们描述一下吗 是高是矮 是黑是白
Can you describe him for me? Was he tall? Short? Skin color?

90
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,060
我只看到面具 但他移动起来很滑稽 动作很僵硬
All I saw was the mask. But he moved funny. Stiff.

91
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,600
往一边倾斜
Leaning to one side.

92
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,900
你知道是什么让他发疯的吗
Do you know what set him off?

93
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,270
可能是警报声
The siren maybe?

94
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,470
远处有救护车的警报声
There was a siren in the distance, an ambulance.

95
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,110
他一听到就朝我奔过来
As soon as he heard it, he was coming for me.

96
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,810
往一边倾斜 动作怪异 看不出身高 肤色
Leaning to one side, acting crazy, no height, no skin color.

97
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,180
- 哇 她可帮大忙了 - 当你惊慌失措时
- Wow, she was a big help. - When you're that scared,

98
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,690
所有的细节都会混在一起
the details can get all jumbled up.

99
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,330
惊慌失措 就像那个害怕警报声的盗贼
Scared, like the robber who's afraid of a siren?

100
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,420
这么说 我们的线索有 高度紧张的情景设置
So, we have a high-stress situation

101
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,790
让人失控发疯的噪音声响
and noise triggering an erratic outburst,

102
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,790
也就是警笛
the siren.

103
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,560
- 我可以列上一整天 - 哦 千万别
- I could list things all day long. - Oh, please don't.

104
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,930
- 看看他们都干了些什么 - 你是店老板吗
- Look what they've done to me. - Are you the owner?

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,930
- 让一下 我要看看后面 - 不行 不行 
- Excuse me, I have to see in the back. - No, no.

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,370
- 嘿 老兄 放松 放松 - 他们打开了保险柜吗
- Hey, buddy, easy, easy. - Did they get in the safe?

107
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,700
- 只动了保险柜 - 哦 天呐 我完蛋了
- Only thing they touched. - Oh, my God. No! I'm screwed.

108
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,600
等等 为什么这么说 
Hold on. Why do you say that?

109
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,670
这些石头 还没上保险呢
The stones. They weren't insured yet.

110
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,840
- 什么石头 - 我这是个小店啊
- What stones? - I'm a small store.

111
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,150
通常 我只保留价值四五万的现货
Normally I keep maybe 40, 50,000 in stock.

112
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,050
但我是参团合伙批发的 因为这样比较实惠
But I buy wholesale as part of a group. We get better leverage.

113
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,050
我们每个月换一个人保管这些石头
Every month it's someone's turn to hold the stones

114
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,850
- 直到我们分货 - 价值多少
- 'til we make the divvy. - And how much are we talking about?

115
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,360
- 零售额大概1.5 - 百万
- Maybe 1.5 retail. - Million?

116
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:08,530
- 现在你们明白我为什么要疯了吧 - 抱歉
- Now you see why I'm freaking out? - Excuse me.

117
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,090
不能进 老兄 不能进
Stay here, man, just stay here.

118
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,760
- 这些石头在这里有多久了 - 两天
- How long had the stones been here for? - Two days.

119
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:17,670
明天我们就要分货了 有的时候需要...
Tomorrow we make the division. Sometimes it gets to be a bit of a...

120
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,670
事先商定 你懂吗
discussion, you understand?

121
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,740
这绝不是意外
This is no accident.

122
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,640
好的 我们需要店里员工的名单 
OK. We're gonna need a list of all your employees,

123
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,940
以及所有合伙珠宝店的店名及地址
and the name and addresses of all these stores in your group

124
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,510
以及其他经常跟你做交易的人 明白了吗
and anyone else you deal with on a regular basis, alright?

125
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,220
- 有监控录像吗 - 有
- Any surveillance video? - Yeah,

126
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,850
这里一个 还有那里
one there, and there.

127
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,620
这些家伙不是第一次出手 他们肯定有犯罪记录
These guys are not first timers.They have to have records.

128
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,620
盗窃侦破组说全加拿大都没有匹配记录
Robbery Squad says there's no match for it in Canada.

129
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,130
- 哪一方面的 - 主要是爆炸装置
- No match for what part? - The explosives mainly.

130
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:48,060
不常见 整个经过都不常见 武器
Not common. But the whole thing's not common. The weapons.

131
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,070
速度 以及他们连看都不看一眼展示柜的态度
The speed. The way these guys don't even look at the display cases.

132
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,140
等下 倒退
Hold on. Back that up.

133
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:58,910
好 停 开始播放 就这里
OK, stop. Play. That, right there.

134
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,970
这些手势 我之前见过
Those hand signals. I've seen that before.

135
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,080
在苏丹与无国界医生组织一起的时候
With Doctors Without Borders in the Sudan.

136
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,500
你觉得这些家伙是非洲人 
You think these guys are African?

137
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,880
不 我觉得他们是军人
No. I think they're military.

138
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,320
我见过特种部队的人用这一模一样的手势
I've seen Special Ops guys use those same hand signals

139
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,090
整个任务执行过程中一句话不说
and run a complete mission in total silence.

140
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,220
- 怎么 - 我在想
- What? - I'm thinking

141
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:19,090
如果他们是军人 也许警报声引发了他们的压力反应
if these guys are military, maybe the siren triggered some kind of stress response.

142
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,490
创伤后应激障碍 你是这么觉得的
PTSD? That's your theory?

143
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:21,910
是的 虽然无法解释一切 
Well, it doesn't explain everything,

144
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,310
但肯定是有可能的
but it's definitely possible.

145
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,270
从军人的角度来看是符合的
The military angle fits.

146
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,300
不然你还能怎么解释这些家伙如此擅长爆炸装置
How else would you explain these guys getting so good at using explosives

147
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,640
又没留过案底 
without leaving a criminal record?

148
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,670
员工里有退役军人吗 
Any of the employees exmilitary?

149
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,640
没有 但公司确实
No. But the company does use

150
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,840
雇佣装甲汽车公司运货 等等
an armored car company for deliveries. Hold on.

151
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,580
没错 这个 杰西・鲍威尔
Yeah, here it is. Jesse Powell.

152
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,950
第123团退役的下士
Ex-corporal in the 123rd Regiment.

153
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,590
汽车公司一个多月前解雇了他
The car company fired him just over a month ago.

154
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,560
也许他对此很愤怒
Maybe he's angry about it.

155
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,790
也许他看中机会赚钱 或者招募其他退伍兵
Or maybe he just saw an opportunity to cash in or recruit some other veterans.

156
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,630
我们去看看他
Let's go take a look at him.

157
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,530
什么事
Yes?

158
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,870
我是艾登・布莱克警探 这是里奥・贝克特
I'm Detective Aidan Black, this is Leo Beckett.

159
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,960
- 我们找杰西・鲍威尔 - 他干什么了
- We're looking for Jesse Powell. - What did he do?

160
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,090
我们只是想跟他谈谈 他在家吗
We just want to talk to him. Is he home?

161
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,830
- 他不住这里 - 他的救济金寄到这里的是吧
- Jesse doesn't live here. - His disability checks come here, right?

162
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:35,360
事情很复杂
It's complicated.

163
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,740
- 你能说详细点吗 - 好 进来吧
- Maybe you could explain it to us. - Alright, come in.

164
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,300
从阿富汗退伍回来之后
Jesse stayed with us for a few months

165
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,170
杰西和我们一起住了几个月
after he got out of the service in Afghanistan.

166
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,480
从他的表现来看 感觉他仍然在战场
You'd think he was still there, from the way he behaved.

167
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,310
一半的时间 他都不睡床 睡地板
Half the time he'd sleep on the floor instead of his own bed.

168
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,380
- 他什么时候搬走的 - 大约六个月前
- When did he move out? - About six months ago.

169
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,950
我们让他走的
We asked him to leave.

170
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,950
他现在在哪里
So where is he now?

171
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,580
我们不知道
We don't...

172
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,580
- 我们和他断了联系 - 这不是我们的错
- we've sort of lost touch with him. - It wasn't our fault.

173
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,360
我们制定计划的时候 他也不来 即使来了也是醉醺醺的
When we made plans, he wouldn't show up. If he did, he was drunk.

174
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:14,430
卢卡斯 我说过不要偷看
Lucas! I told you not to spy.

175
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,500
那是杰西的儿子
That's Jesse's son.

176
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:19,040
杰西最近有工作吗
Has Jesse been working much lately?

177
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,020
上次问他的时候 他在开装甲汽车
He was driving an armored car last time we talked.

178
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,320
现在不干了
Not anymore.

179
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,750
他偶尔过来拿救济金 我也不清楚
Well, he stops in once in a while to pick up a check. I don't know.

180
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,920
鲍威尔先生 我们急需找到他
Look, Mr. Powell, we really need to find him.

181
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,920
你肯定有办法联系到他的
There's gotta be some way you can contact him.

182
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,320
我希望有 但是杰西
I wish I could. But Jesse's...

183
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,490
我们是兄弟
We're brothers, you know.

184
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:45,630
有的时候 好像我总会惹火他
Sometimes, it just seems like...I push his buttons.

185
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,970
他想见你们
Hey, he wanted to meet you.

186
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,900
你们在谈论爸爸吗 他会来给我过生日吗
Are you talking about Dad? Is he coming to my birthday?

187
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:56,140
- 就在两天后 - 他当然会来 卢卡斯
- It's in two days. - Of course he is, Lucas.

188
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:00,110
- 他无论如何不会错过的 - 我觉得不对
- He wouldn't miss it for the world. - I don't buy it.

189
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,620
那是他弟弟 他在保护弟弟
He's the guy's brother. He's protecting him.

190
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,510
不
No.

191
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,280
杰西的行为明显给他的婚姻造成了问题
Jesse's behaviour is clearly causing problems in that marriage.

192
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,890
但你真觉得杰西会抛弃孩子 离开这里吗
Still, you think Jesse's really gonna leave town with his kid here?

193
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,390
再说 如果他患有创伤后应激障碍
Plus, if he's suffering from post-traumatic stress...

194
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,490
又来这套 你从哪儿得来的结论
Again with the PTSD? Where do you get that?

195
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:18,190
你知道在回国老兵中
You know that occupational stress injuries

196
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,230
应激障碍很普遍
are common among vets returning,

197
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,230
尤其是从阿富汗回来的老兵
especially from Afghanistan.

198
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,360
再加上酗酒和睡地板
Add that to the drunkenness and sleeping on the floor...

199
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,000
很快 结论是他是个喜欢开枪抢银行的精神病患者
Presto! We have our trigger-happy, bank-robbing psychopath.

200
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,470
我说的不是这个
That's not what I'm saying.

201
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,710
罪案心理分析科
Psych Crimes.

202
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,840
找你的
It's for you.

203
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,850
艾登・布莱克
Aidan Black.

204
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,080
我是乔治・鲍威尔 关于我弟弟杰西 我有个想法
Hey, it's George Powell. I had a thought about my brother Jesse.

205
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,420
- 你知道他在哪里吗 - 你答应我
- You know where he is? - You promise me

206
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,250
不要伤害他 好吗 他需要帮助
that you're not gonna hurt him. OK? He needs help.

207
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,920
鲍威尔先生 告诉我他在哪里
Tell me where he is, Mr. Powell.

208
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,290
有时我带卢卡斯去市区
I take Lucas downtown sometimes,

209
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,290
的一个收容所
to a homeless shelter.

210
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,330
无论我妻子怎么说 孩子都需要见父亲
The boy needs to see his father, no matter what my wife says.

211
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,030
- 你有地址吗 - 有的
- You have an address? - Yeah, yeah.

212
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:09,070
救助站的人说他在这里
The guy at the shelter said that he's down here.

213
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,740
好
Alright.

214
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,740
退后点
You know what, just stay back,

215
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:17,010
- 以防万一 - 好
- just... just in case. - OK.

216
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,940
杰西
Jesse?

217
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:32,630
我们是警察
Police.

218
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,340
给 再来杯咖啡
Here you go, another coffee.

219
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,380
你在装甲汽车联盟里工作了多久
So you were with Alliance Armored Cars for how long?

220
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,740
- 不知道 六个月吧 - 你为什么被解雇
- I don't know. Six months. - Why'd you get fired?

221
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,850
工作时喝酒
Drinking on the job.

222
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,640
你有没有给铁杉珍稀宝石运过货
You ever deliver to Hemlock Rare Gems?

223
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,720
偶尔
Once in a while.

224
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:08,790
你知道那家店今天早上被抢劫了吗
You know they got robbed this morning?

225
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,790
几个人炸开了保险箱
Team of guys blew open the safe.

226
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,190
原来 保险箱里有
Turns out there was an unusually

227
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,160
异常多的宝石
large stock of gems on hand.

228
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,300
好吧
Yeah, well...

229
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,500
对了 是用你之前开的车运过去的
Delivered by your old truck, by the way.

230
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,720
和我无关
Nothing to do with me.

231
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,910
你确定吗
You sure about that?

232
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,190
当然 我怎么会知道有特快专递
Yeah, how would I know about some special delivery?

233
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,570
店主说运送日期是固定的
Well, the owner told me it happens on a regular basis,

234
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,110
和你还在职的时候一样
even back when you were working there.

235
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,380
杰西 昨晚你在哪里
Where were you last night, Jesse?

236
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,420
不记得了
I don't know.

237
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,880
我昨天不清醒 喝太多了
I was barely functional yesterday. Drank too much.

238
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,720
- 店几点被劫的 - 很早 早上六点
- When was the store robbed? - Early. Six A.M.

239
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,530
我在救济站的床上 你可以和那边确认
Well, I was in my bunk. You can check with the shelter.

240
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,790
他们肯定记得
They'll remember.

241
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,160
我在那儿还吐了
I left a little... mess.

242
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,050
所以他们把我赶出来了
It's why they kicked me out.

243
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,870
一定很
Must've been...

244
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,360
你被解雇肯定生气
kind of pissed off when you got fired.

245
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,070
不
No.

246
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,900
或许你跟以前军队的朋友说起过
Maybe you told some of the old military buddies about it?

247
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:08,630
没有
No.

248
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,010
是个好故事 大量宝石运到小店里
It's a good story. Big shipment to a little store.

249
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,650
不不不
No. No. No. No!

250
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,850
也许你不记得了 也许你醉了
Maybe you don't remember. Maybe you were drunk.

251
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,590
如果我醒着 我肯定记得 好吗
If I'm awake, then I fricking remember, okay?

252
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,920
- 是吗 今天几号  - 我 谁关心今天几号
- Really. What's the date today? - I... Who cares?

253
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,920
比如你儿子卢卡斯 他可能会关心 
Your son, Lucas, for one. He might care.

254
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,900
他要过生日了
He's got a birthday coming up.

255
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,900
今天几号了
What day is it?

256
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,580
十二号
It's the 12th.

257
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,370
好吧
Okay.

258
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,710
跟我讲讲你军队里的老战友
Tell me about your old army buddies.

259
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,610
- 我不想说 - 你们关系好吗
- I'm not talking about them. - Were you guys close?

260
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,710
- 我不想说 - 好吧 听我说
- I'm not talking about them. - Alright, well listen to me.

261
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,550
如果他们其中有人精神失控 光天化日在街上开枪呢
How about if one of them lost his shit and shot up a street in broad daylight?

262
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,390
你能帮我们
You can help us here.

263
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:57,560
大伙儿 救助站证实他整晚都在
So, guys, the shelter confirmed that he was there all night.

264
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:00,330
他们夜间锁门 早上七点才开门
They lock the place up, nobody gets out before 7.

265
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,160
- 所以他不在现场 - 真是太巧合了
- So he wasn't there. - It's a pretty strong coincidence.

266
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,090
我觉得他知道一些事情 没告诉我们
I think he knows something he's not telling us.

267
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,490
找出他的服役记录 看谁是他战友
Pull his service records, let's find out who he served with.

268
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,190
放他走吗
Do we let him go?

269
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,080
不 请不要让我等
No, please... please don't put me on hold.

270
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,950
我等会儿打给你 谢谢
I have to call you back. Thanks.

271
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,350
鲍威尔先生 我是雷德利医生
Mr. Powell? I'm Dr. Ridley,

272
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,750
心理医生
psychiatrist.

273
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,920
心理医生也能当警察了
They let shrinks be cops?

274
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,360
现在我们能做很多事
You'd be surprised at what they let us do nowadays.

275
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,760
你接受心理辅导了吗
are you getting any counselling?

276
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,800
跟你有什么关系
I don't see how that's any of your business.

277
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,290
恕我直言
Don't mean to be rude.

278
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,910
我非常理解
No, I completely understand,

279
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,980
但我可以为你在圣・斯蒂芬's医院安排评估
but I can arrange an assessment for you at St. Stephen's.

280
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,370
- 那儿有很多治疗方法 - 治疗什么
- There are a lot of treatment options. - Treatment for what?

281
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,570
不是心理医生也看得出你状态不好
Look, it doesn't take a shrink to see that you're not doing so well.

282
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,740
你之前在阿富汗服役
You were in Afghanistan?

283
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:55,150
许多征战归来的人状态都不是很好
A lot of people coming home are not doing great.

284
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,150
嗯
Yeah.

285
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,180
听着 你不必独自面对这种状况
Look, you don't have to go through this alone.

286
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,420
- 我们有支援团 和药物治疗 - 简直是扯淡
- There's support groups, medication. - It's all crap.

287
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:04,120
好吧 请把这个拿着
OK, please take this.

288
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:06,920
请你好好考虑一下
Please. And just think about it.

289
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:14,900
从退役老兵事务部得到了些帮助
Got some cooperation from Veteran's Affairs.

290
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,230
从杰西・鲍威尔所在的部队找到了些资料
Current files from Jesse Powell's unit,

291
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,470
至少有那些退役老兵的
at least those no longer serving.

292
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:22,800
- 你可以带回家看 - 谁说我要回家
- You can take them home. - Who says I'm going home?

293
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:25,470
别干了 艾登
Pack it in, Aidan.

294
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,580
好的
I will.

295
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:34,350
- 你得休息会儿 - 毫无疑问是的
- You should get some sleep. - No doubt.

296
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,690
我再待五分钟 你先走吧
I'm 5 minutes behind you, man. Just go.

297
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,920
我说要你回家
I said go home.

298
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,020
我犯什么错了 工作到很晚吗
What's the crime? Working late?

299
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,960
等下 我有点儿头绪了
Wait. I got something.

300
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,830
看
Watch.

301
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,830
你看他怎么拿包 用他的前臂托着
You see how he picks up the bag, he scoops it with his forearm?

302
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,800
他的手不管用 是假肢
His hand doesn't work. It's a prosthetic.

303
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,640
- 你确定 - 不信你送去分析科
- Are you sure? - Send it to analysis.

304
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,640
- 他们会说我是对的 - 什么是对的
- They'll say I'm right. - Right about what?

305
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,170
其中一个劫匪用假肢 
One of the robbers has a prosthetic hand.

306
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,180
杰西的部队里有没有这样一个人
Anyone in Jesse's unit missing one?

307
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,040
左手还是右手
Right or left?

308
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,660
- 你知道是谁吗 - 没有 就是问问
- You got someone? - No. Just asking.

309
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:21,850
- 里奥 你那堆资料里有没有 - 没有 只有一个没腿的
- Leo, anyone in your pile? - No, just got a guy with no legs.

310
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,090
联系退伍军人事务部 看看他们能不能帮忙
Get over to Veterans Affairs. See if they can help out.

311
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,860
- 这就去 - 这么说你现在相信我了
- On it. - So you believe me now?

312
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:29,820
是的 我相信你
Yeah, I believe you.

313
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,260
但并不意味着你就可以
But that doesn't mean you get to treat this place

314
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,300
把这里当成街边的汽车旅馆
like the bloody roadside motel.

315
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:37,070
你要不要找人谈谈 艾登
Are you gonna talk to somebody about this, Aidan?

316
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,010
我能把持住
I got it under control.

317
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,740
我去冲个澡
I'm gonna hit the showers.

318
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:57,380
- 嘿 退伍军人事务部有消息吗 - 没有呢
- Hey, how'd it go with Veterans Affairs? - It didn't.

319
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,780
怎么 他们连伤残索赔数据库都没有吗
What, they don't have a database for disability claims?

320
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,800
哦 他们有
Oh, they do.

321
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,020
他们说要列个名单给我们
They said they could compile a list for us.

322
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,320
需要一份授权令和三周的通告
With a warrant and three weeks' notice.

323
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:08,690
接电话的那位女士说他们有两百多份现用档案
The woman we spoke to said there are over 200 active files.

324
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,100
而且还有上百人不在这个系统里
And hundreds of more people that aren't even in the system.

325
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:14,500
八十岁的退伍军人在外游荡不回家
80-year-old vets living in the streets.

326
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,600
我们把这些小伙子送去海外捱枪子儿
We send these guys overseas to get shot at,

327
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,970
他们回来的时候却缠着浸透鲜血的绷带
and they get tangled up in red tape when they come home.

328
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,610
好吧 肯定有办法找到这个家伙 四个退伍军人
OK, there's gotta be a way to find this guy. Four vets,

329
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:24,340
一起抢劫 其中一个有假肢
working together to stage a robbery. One with a prosthetic hand.

330
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:27,850
可能是创伤后应激障碍 别又批判我 我只是...
And possible PTSD. Don't start. I'm just...

331
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:31,750
- 这只是个人观点 - 不 你说的可能在理
- It's my opinion. - No, you might be on to something.

332
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,020
- 你去哪儿 - 调查
- Where are you going? - Recon.

333
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:45,300
我们曾经在北美最棒的
We were the best damn fighting unit

334
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:48,060
作战部队
in North America.

335
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:52,440
但他们对我们百般虐待
And they threw us out on our asses.

336
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,940
没有一句感谢
No thank yous,

337
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,770
也不给我们选择权
no options.

338
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:01,210
我呼吸了四个国家的尘垢啊 伙计
I sucked dirt in four countries, man.

339
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,580
却难防自己人的暗箭
To get stabbed in the back by my own.

340
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,880
我四处游荡 想...
I walk around looking to...

341
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,690
想找个人揍一顿
looking to punch somebody in the face.

342
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,990
期待着发生一件能让我解脱的事 
Waiting for that one little thing that's gonna set me off, man.

343
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,130
好吧 这不是创伤后应激障碍
OK, that's not PTSD;

344
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,030
只说明你就是个混蛋
That's just you being an asshole.

345
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:25,100
让我们听一听我们的新成员的故事
Let's hear from the newest member

346
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:28,700
你何不介绍一下自己呢
of our group here. Why don't you introduce yourself?

347
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:33,140
我叫艾登 而且...
I'm Aidan. And...

348
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,840
我睡不着
I can't sleep.

349
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,180
你想谈谈吗
You feel like talking about it?

350
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,410
你的失眠
Your sleeplessness?

351
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,910
不太想
Not really.

352
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,910
这对他没用的
That's not gonna work for him.

353
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,050
你来是有原因的
You came for a reason.

354
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,220
我是个工作狂
I'm a workaholic.

355
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,260
我把工作带回家 我熬夜到很晚
I bring it home, I stay up too late.

356
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,960
你介意告诉我们你是干什么的吗
Do you mind if I ask what you do?

357
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,790
我是警察
I'm a cop.

358
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,790
我们中的第一个
That's a first for us.

359
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:04,630
你是警察 这是退伍军人小组 伙计
You're a cop? This is a veteran's group, man.

360
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,330
开枪杀人的时候穿着什么样的制服
It matter what uniform you're wearing

361
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,440
这个重要吗
when you shoot someone?

362
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,440
有道理
Fair enough.

363
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:15,340
你会重现当时的情景么 你提到的枪杀事件
Do you have flashbacks about it? The shooting you mentioned?

364
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,010
- 偶尔会 - 你会梦到吗
- Sometimes. - Do you dream about it?

365
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:21,350
- 不会 - 你会害怕
- No. - Are you afraid

366
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,780
- 你梦到它吗 - 我会控制
- of dreaming about it? - I deal with it.

367
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,950
- 我懂了- 我有失眠症 这是...
- I hear that. - I have insomnia. It's...

368
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,660
不 你没有 你有创伤后应激障碍
No you don't. You have Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.

369
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:35,360
你拼命工作只是为了逃避睡眠
You're working your ass off to avoid sleeping.

370
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,400
别 别假装不是这样 至少别在这个组里
And don't... don't pretend otherwise. At least not with this group.

371
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:43,840
我自己 我在工作的时候晕倒在桌子上
Myself, I'd pass out at my desk at work.

372
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,140
我回来后在广告业干了一阵子
I was in advertising for a while when I got back.

373
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:49,940
我做完了自己的项目 就开始
If I finished my own project, I'd start work

374
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:53,140
帮别人做 什么都做 就是不让自己
on somebody else's. Anything to avoid

375
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,610
休息 不让我的思想停滞
relaxing, letting my mind open up.

376
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,820
因为一旦停下往事就会重现 对吗
'Cause that's when it hits you, right?

377
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:12,690
那么 是什么让一个警察来到退伍军人支援团的
So. What brings a cop to a veterans' support group?

378
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:15,100
看到了一则启事 觉得我可以试一试
Saw a notice. Thought I'd give it a try.

379
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,930
还有呢
And?

380
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,040
你想听真话
You want the truth?

381
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,030
呃...
Ah...

382
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:28,680
我觉得我的情况要好过他们大部分人
I think I'm doing better than most of those guys.

383
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,610
但你还是来了呀
And yet you're still here.

384
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,850
你想听真话吗
You want the truth?

385
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,850
我觉得他们有一半人今晚都会比你睡得香
I think half those guys will sleep better tonight than you will.

386
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:45,190
呃 我能问你个问题吗
Um, can I ask you a question?

387
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:48,560
- 作为一个警察吗 - 有一个人
- As a policeman? - There's a guy,

388
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:51,930
他有一只假手 可能是个退伍军人 病的不轻
he's got a prosthetic hand. He's probably a veteran, wound really tight.

389
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,800
小组是保密的
Group is confidential.

390
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,540
你不是医生 对吧
You're not a doctor, are ya?

391
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,940
不是
No.

392
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:03,110
你没得选 我可以拿到法院传令
It's not actually your choice. I could get a court order.

393
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:06,110
听着 我想逮捕那个家伙肯定不是因为他有假肢
Look, I'm not looking to arrest a guy just because he has a prosthetic hand.

394
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,880
我要找的这个人 他有武器
The guy I'm looking for, he's armed,

395
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,420
状况很糟 所以如果他碰巧是你的组员
he's in a really bad place. So if he happens to be one of your guys,

396
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:16,190
我不觉得你替他保守秘密是在帮他
I'm not sure how you keeping it a secret is gonna help him.

397
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,830
需要一个叫科瓦奇斯的人的现居住址
Need a current address on Kovacks.

我来找
I'm on it.

401
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:33,410
你从哪儿知道这个的
Where did you get this?

402
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:35,390
我参加了一个创伤后应激障碍小组
I joined a PTSD group.

403
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:38,220
- 退伍军人的创伤后应激障碍小组 - 嗯 他们没把我赶出来
- A veteran PTSD group? - Well, they didn't kick me out.

404
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,880
他们知道你为什么去吗
Did they know why you were there?

405
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,650
我为什么去很重要吗
Does it matter why I was there?

406
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,680
我能跟你谈谈吗
Can I talk to you one minute?

407
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,120
谢了 伙计 你把我从一堂说教里解救出来了
Thanks, man. You saved me from another lecture.

408
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,000
不 我没有

409
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,360
- 你参加了治疗小组 - 是的 而且我得到了引导
- You went into a therapy group? - Yeah, and I got a lead.

410
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,950
你知道这有多不合适吗 
You understand how inappropriate that is?

411
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:56,760
这些人得互相信任
These people have to trust each other.

412
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,010
有什么大碍 他们不知道我去那里干嘛
Who's it hurt? They don't know why I'm there.

413
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,540
是的 但是他们有隐私权 而且有权知道是谁在听
Yeah, but they have a right to privacy. And to know who's listening,

414
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:05,200
特别是当他们在那里努力寻求治愈的时候
especially when they're there just to try and heal.

415
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:10,870
谢谢
Thank you.

416
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:14,810

Kind of guy who can shape a charge to blow open a safe while he's in the same room.

423
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:35,960
- 能找到他的地址吗 - 这上面没有写

424
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,050
没有残疾 没有领抚恤金 
No disability, not pulling a pension.

425
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,670
但是既然我们知道他在哪个部队服过役
But now that we know what unit he was in,

426
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,090
我们可以找找他的战友 
we can find out who he served with.

427
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,770
我们还要找其他三个人
We're still looking for the other three.

428
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,940
- 嗨 我们应该把这个发给盗窃侦破组 - 是啊
- Hey, we should send this to Robbery. - Yeah,

429
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:47,240
- 这样能加快案子进展 - 不 她说得对
- 'cause that'll speed things up. - No. She's right.

430
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:49,610
他们有权知道
They need to know.

431
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:06,890
- 嗨 你要进来吗 - 嗯

- So, you served with Pete Kovacks? - Two tours.

434
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,170
他的手被炸的时候你在场吗
Were you there when he lost his hand?

435
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,570
彼特有麻烦了吗
Is Pete in trouble?

436
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,800
我们必须找到他 你知道他在哪儿吗
We need to find him. Do you know where he is?

437
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:22,770
我们没有联系
We never kept in touch.

438
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:25,340
我俩退役的时候在佩塔瓦瓦见过他
Saw him at Petawawa when we were both getting out.

439
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:27,350
几个月前在体育酒吧遇见过
Ran into him at a sports bar a few months ago.

440
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:30,450
你能想到你们队里会有谁知道他的下落吗
Anyone else in your unit you can think of that might know where he is?

441
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,150
表示怀疑 彼特有些孤僻
I doubt it. Pete was a bit of a loner,

442
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,590
和队里的其他人处的不好
never really got along with the other guys in the unit.

443
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:39,360
- 他经常和123团的人在一起 - 他们在哪儿
- Spent a lot of time with the 123rd. - Where was that?

坎大哈
Kandahar.

445
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,560
我们在基地睡过临床 我们这些人都是这么认识的
We used to bunk beside each other on base. Guys got to know each other.

446
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,180
你认识杰西・鲍威尔吗
You know a guy named Jesse Powell?

447
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,660
认识 点头交而已
Sure. I mean, to say hello to, yeah.

448
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:49,900
彼特认识他吗 
Did Pete know him?

449
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:53,210
他和杰西走得很近 互相照应 
He and Jesse were close, looked out for each other.

450
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:56,000
我觉得彼特受伤的时候杰西应该在场
I think Jesse was there when Pete got injured.

451
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:02,710
如果想找彼特 你们应该去找杰西谈谈
If you wanna find Pete, you should talk to Jesse.

452
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,070
我们得走了 我们说好的 
We gotta go, that was the deal!

453
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,080
干完这一票 我们就上路
We do the job, then we hit the road.

454
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,090
- 我做不到 - 你想被抓吗
- I can't. - You trying to get caught?

455
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:12,970
最近怎么样 兄弟
How you doing, buddy?

456
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,020
- 见到你真高兴 - 你有麻烦了
- Glad to see you. - You got trouble.

457
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,960
警察找我问铁杉珠宝店的事情了
The cops talked to me about Hemlock Jewels.

458
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:19,530
你得劝劝他 不然我们都要完蛋
You need to talk some sense into him, or we're all screwed.

459
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,530
他说得对 警察要抓你
He's right. They're gonna track you down.

460
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,200
你何不告诉我你接下来要怎么做
Why didn't you tell me what you were gonna do?

461
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,100
- 我不想连累你 - 我已经被连累了 警察以为我
- Didn't wanna get you involved. - Well, I am! They think

462
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:28,070
- 帮忙策划了 - 告诉他们你没做过就好了
- that I helped plan it. - Just tell 'em you didn't do it.

463
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,330
他们说你大喊大叫 还在大街上开枪
They said you were screaming. That you shot up the street.

464
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:35,170
- 发生什么了 - 我不知道 好吗
- What happened? - I don't know, OK?

465
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:37,680
我朝货车走过去
I'm walking to the van,

466
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,580
接下来 我感觉我又回到了战场 伙计
and next thing I know, I'm right back there, man.

467
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,580
就在战斗最激烈的时刻
Right in the thick of it.

468
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,320
那些景象 声音
Sights, sounds,

469
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:50,520
所有一切 我当时魂都吓没了
everything, man. It scared the shit out of me.

470
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,390
你得控制住自己 
You gotta get a hold of yourself.

471
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:54,290
警察会找上门来的
The cops, they're gonna find you here.

472
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,830
- 你当我不知道吗 - 那你他妈就赶紧离开镇上啊
- You don't think I know that? - So get the hell out of town!

473
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,930
我做不到 我不能那么做
I can't! I can't do that!

474
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,070
听我说 我离开这里就再没安全可言了 我真的做不到
Look, it's not safe for me out there anymore. Man, it's... I can't.

475
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:09,970
那就跟我一起 我们一起走
So come with me. We'll go together.

476
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:12,610
不 你根本没听懂
No! You're not listening!

477
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:14,780
如果我出去了
If I go out there,

478
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:17,310
我就会陷入不利 而且无路可逃
I'm pinned down and there's no way out.

479
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:20,520
那你准备怎么做
So what are you gonna do?

480
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,590
只要他们别管我 我就不会有事的
If they leave me alone, I'll be fine.

481
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:28,860
- 但那是不可能的... - 只能这样
- But that's not gonna happen... - That's the way it is!

482
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,960
- 我们等够了 - 我们撤了
- We're done waiting. - We're out of here.

483
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,370
别管他们了 好吗
Just forget 'em! OK?

484
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,300
我就在这儿呆着了
I'm making a stand here.

485
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:41,300
如果事情就这样结束了 那就顺其自然吧
And if this is the way it ends, then so be it.

486
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,340
但我是不会走的
But I'm not moving.

487
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:46,240
不会因为你 或者其他人而改变主意
Not for you or anybody else.

488
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,320
我们浏览了彼特和杰西所有的个人资料
We've gone through all of Pete and Jesse's personnel files.

489
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,760
大部分很详尽 但还是有一些遗漏
Most are accounted for, but there's still a few hold-outs.

490
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,190
有人找到劫匪的消息了吗 
Does anyone look good for the robbery?

491

罗杰・兰代尔 海军陆战队中士

他的室友说他今天早上往车上装行李 说要去长途旅行
His roommate said he packed up his car this morning, going on a long trip.

494
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:35,160
我们会发布他的车牌号和外貌描述的通缉令
We got a dispatch to send out a plate number and a description.

495
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,630
- 那杰西・鲍威尔呢 - 一无所获
- What about Jesse Powell? - No dice.

496
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,770
我们去避难所调查过了 他收拾东西离开了
We checked the shelter; he's packed up and moved on.

497
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,790
他们都人间蒸发了似的
They're all scattering in the wind.

498
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:45,390
- 杰西不会的 - 为什么
- Not Jesse. Not yet. - Why not?

499
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:48,050
他还有一件事情要做
He's still got something he's gotta do.

500
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:00,540
- 你儿子的生日你都迟到 - 迟到比不来好多了
- Late for your son's birthday. - Better late than never.

501

502
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:13,240
嗨 杰西

00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,310
呃 别走
Uh, uh, uh, uh. No, no.

504
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:25,210
你的四个老战友抢了你之前送货的珠宝店
So four guys rob a store on your old route.

505
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:29,180
他们四个知道店里有什么 因为有人对他们泄密了
Four guys who know what's inside 'cause someone tipped them off.

- Anyone you know match that description? - No one I can think of.

508
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,260
那个叫彼特・科瓦奇斯的家伙呢
How about a guy named Pete Kovacks?

509
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:44,930
我希望你能明白一些事情 杰西
I want you to understand something here, Jesse.

510
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,880
你就要越界了
You're about to cross a line.

511
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,130
你之前就不配合我们 直到现在你还在说谎
You were uncooperative before. As of right now, you keep lying,

512
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:53,240
我们可以指控你妨碍司法公正
you're going to be facing charges. Obstruction of justice.

513
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,210

516
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,020
回来之后你见过他吗
Have you seen him since you came back?

517
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:11,220
- 偶尔 - 你跟他说过铁杉珠宝店的事吗
- Time to time. - You tell him about Hemlock Jewels?

518
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:15,160
没有 我不知道 也许说过
No. I don't know. Maybe.

519
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,870
我不记得了 我喝醉了
I don't remember, OK. I was drunk.

520
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:20,800
你说过只要你醒着就都记得
You said you always remember, as long as you're awake.

521
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:24,530
好吧 就算说了又怎样
OK, so what if I did?

522
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:26,800
谈论自己的工作不算犯罪吧
It's not a crime to talk about your work.

523
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,200
要是谋划抢劫的话就是了 
It is if you're planning a robbery.

524
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,640
我跟那件事一点关系都没有
I didn't have anything to do with it.

525
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:33,710
我也不会帮助你们抓我的朋友
And I'm not going to help you put one of my friends away.

526
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,880
如果你觉得他犯了罪 那你就自己去抓他
You think he did something, catch him yourself.

527
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:43,650
你真的觉得你这是在帮彼特吗 杰西
You really think you're helping Pete, Jesse?

528
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:46,890
彼特只是碰巧闯入了
Pete just broke

529
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,120
一个与从前相似的场景 他进门 出门 收工了
into a place like a pro. He was in, out, done.

530
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,420
然后有些事触发了他的记忆
But then something set him off.

531
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:55,890
他袭击了一个女人 还开了枪
He attacked a woman and he fired his weapon.

532
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:58,800
你要是丢下彼特不管 任他在这条路上走下去
You leave Pete out there, on the path that he's on,

533
00:30:58,830 --> 00:30:59,900
他迟早会闹出人命的
he's gonna kill someone.

534
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,270
刚刚接到了伊利堡边境处的电话
Just got a call from the border crossing at Fort Erie.

535
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:04,940
他们截住了一辆车 跟兰代尔的牌照相符 车上有三个男人
They stopped a car matching Langdale's plates. Three men,

536
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:07,240
后备箱还有二十万美金现钞
200 grand in cash in the trunk.

537
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,210
我们要找的珠宝店劫匪
Our jewelry thieves.

538
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:10,590
我们会查清楚的 他们已经扣留了这三个人准备审讯
We'll find out. They're holding them for questioning.

539
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:11,730
去吧
Go.

540
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:16,650
你知道吗 我觉得彼特已经不止患有创伤后应激障碍那么简单了
You know, I think Pete's got more than just PTSD.

541
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,650
我觉得他另有所图
I think he's got an axe to grind.

542
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,950
而且我认为你知道这是为什么
And I think you know why.

543
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:24,160
他脑子里到底在想什么 杰西
What's going on inside his head, Jesse?

544
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,230
我不知道
I don't know that.

545
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,860
他失去手的时候你在现场吗
Were you there when he lost his hand?

546
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,630
跟我们说说吧 杰西
Tell us about it, Jesse.

547
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,400
彼特是个好人
Pete was a good guy.

548
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,870
他就像冰一样
He was like ice.

549
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,130
任何人都不能影响他
You couldn't rattle him.

550
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:44,080
他就是为防爆任务而生的
Guy was built for bomb squad duty.

551
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,390
当时我们正要撤离一个城镇 
We were clearing out a town.

552
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,280
塔利班之前去过 还炸毁了一所学校
Taliban had come in and blown up a school.

553
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:54,590
作为对同意女孩入学的惩罚
Punishment for letting girls attend.

554
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,420
到处都是狙击手和爆炸装置
Left a bunch of sniper nests, IEDs everywhere.

555
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,830
警报响个不停
Sirens going off the whole time.

556
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,830
我们走过一栋又一栋房子
We're moving house to house,

557
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,660
很慢 很有秩序 让防爆组的人
slow and methodical, letting the bomb guys

558
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:08,400
清理每个房间 我们接到一条信息
clear out each room. We get a message

559
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,580
让我们朝这条街道进发 
to start working down this one street,

560
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,930
意思就是他们已经消灭了所有的狙击手
meaning they've cleared the snipers out.

561
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,940
后来事实证明我们错了
Turns out that's not right.

562
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:16,470
我旁边的那个家伙喉部中枪 我和彼特
Guy next to me takes one in the throat. Me and Pete

563
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:19,020
请求支援 但我们知道已经来不及了
are calling out for support, but we both know it's not gonna make it in time.

564
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,320
所以我们逃跑了
So we ran.

565
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,010
可能没看到警报网线
Missed a trip-wire, I guess.

566
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:26,320
那是触发装置
That's what they were using for triggers, these little bits

567
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:30,320
用几乎看不见的鱼线做的 彼特绊动了它
of fishing line you can barely see. Pete took it full on,

568
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:33,160
但他穿着防弹服
but he had his suit on,

569
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:35,690
所以只失去了手
so all he lost was his hand.

570
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,160
- 他失去的不仅仅是手 对吧 - 是的
- And that's not all he lost, huh? - No.

571
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,400
你去排查某个荒凉的地方
You go over to some godforsaken place,

572
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,700
那里的人根本不想你去
they don't even want ya.

573
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:47,670
因为他们分不清你是好人还是坏人
Can't tell the good guys from the bad guys,

574
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,140
任何人都有可能在你背后开枪 这一切都为了什么呢
everybody maybe gonna put a bullet in your back. For what?

575
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,510
为了回家
So you can come home

576
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:56,980
然后发现根本没人在意你吗
and realise no one gives a shit?

577
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:01,050
没人知道我们为什么而战
No one has a damn clue what we're fighting for.

578
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:06,350
人们都觉得你疯了
People looking at you like you're crazy,

579
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:08,750
觉得你神智有问题
like there's something wrong with you.

580
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:11,720
因为确实是
'Cause there is.

581
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,200
杰西 彼特需要你
Pete needs you, Jesse.

582
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:19,530
你知道的
You know that.

583
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:25,170
为什么不告诉我们他在哪儿呢
So why don't you just tell us where he is?

584
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,170
我带你们去找他
I'll take you to him.

585
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:29,470
为什么不直接告诉我们地址呢
Why don't you just give us the address?

586
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:32,980
除非让我和你们一起去
Only if you let me come with you.

587
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,850
- 你在做什么 - 什么意思 你也听到他说的
- What are you doing? - What do you mean? You heard the guy.

588
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,150
他和我们一起去才会说出地点
He's not gonna give us the location unless he comes with.

589
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:44,320
一个我行我素的人还不够吗 还得弄得更复杂吗
One loose cannon isn't enough? We need to complicate the situation?

590
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,190
- 你想我们怎么做 - 彼特・科瓦奇斯极其危险
- What would you have us do? - Pete Kovacks is extremely dangerous.

591
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,490
如果他感到了威胁 可能会变得很暴力
If he feels threatened, he could turn violent.

592
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,160
我们知道
We've got it.

593
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:54,000
小心点
Just be careful.

594
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,380
蹲下 蹲下
Stay down. Stay down.

595
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:10,580
弗伦 到底怎么回事 
Phalen? What the hell is going on? The instructions

596
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:12,680
上级指示设立安全范围 隐藏起来
were to establish a perimeter and stay out of sight.

597
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,300
一个巡警靠近了大楼 操之过急 
So patrolman approached the building. He jumped the gun.

598
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,580
大楼里的人就开枪了
Guy inside opened fire.

599
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,850
他差点死在那儿了
Patrolman barely got out of there alive.

600
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:29,040
- 放烟雾弹把他熏出来 - 没用 他有防雾面具
- We're gonna have to gas him out. - Won't work. Mask.

601
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,990
- 抱歉 你是谁 - 疑犯的朋友
- I'm sorry, who are you? - He's a friend of the suspect.

602
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,140
他们在阿富汗一起服过役
They served together in Afghanistan.

603
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,160
杰西 你能和他谈谈吗
Jesse, you think you can talk to him?

604
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:39,060
我可以试试
I can try.

605
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:41,200
布莱克 等等 他是个平民
Hold on there, Black. This guy's a civilian.

606
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:44,140
我见过的战火比你多了去了
Bet I've seen more hostile fire than you.

607
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,170
我们让他试试
We're gonna give him a shot.

608
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,210
谁给我个扩音器
Someone get me a megaphone.

609
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,610
杰西 和他谈谈
Talk to him, Jesse.

610
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:01,990
彼特 我是杰西
Pete, it's Jesse.

611
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:04,860
伙计们 他被困在里面 这声音只会让他感觉更糟
Guys, he's boxed in. The noise is probably just gonna make it worse.

612
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,660
我必须和他谈谈
I gotta talk to him.

613
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:10,770
哇哦 杰西 等等 伙计
Whoa, whoa, Jesse, hold on, man!

614
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,770
艾登 艾登
Aidan! Aidan!

615
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,910
彼特
Pete?

616
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,840
彼特 外面有个战略小队
Pete, there's a tactical squad outside

617
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,940
他们只用三十秒就能攻破这里
that's gonna bust in here in about 30 seconds.

618
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,950
他们进来时 我可不想在这里
I'd rather not be here when that happens,

619
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:09,280
但你不走 我是不会出去的
but I'm not leaving without you.

620
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,150
就像在那里的战火风暴一样 伙计
Just like that shit storm over there, buddy.

621
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:14,290
我们得一起出去
We got to get out of this together.

622
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:58,890
彼特
Pete?

623
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:01,800
我是艾登・布莱克警探
This is Detective Aidan Black.

624
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:05,740
放下你的武器
I need you to surrender your weapon.

625
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,040
趴下
Down!

626
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:16,280
彼特 要是非得开枪的话 那就从我开始
Pete, if there's gonna be any shooting, it's gonna start with me.

627
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:18,480
杰西 别逼我
Don't make me do this, Jesse.

628
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:22,680
都不要开枪 没必要出现伤亡
There's not gonna be any shooting, alright? Nobody needs to get hurt here.

629
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,450
你们两个现在都出去
Get out! Both of you, now!

630
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,590
彼特 我办不到 我们现在是在同一条船上
I can't do that, Pete. We're all in this together now.

631
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,630
放下枪
Drop the gun.

632
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:34,190
不 我得保护自己
No! I need to protect myself.

633
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:37,870
朋友 我知道你很害怕 相信我 我明白那种感受
Look, man, I understand you're afraid. Believe me, I know what that feels like.

634
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:41,000
但你这样不是在保护自己
But you're not protecting yourself.

635
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:43,970
只会让自己中枪身亡 彼特 你知道的
You're just gonna get yourself shot, Pete, and you know it.

636
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,400
没人会在乎 对吧
And what's that gonna matter to anyone else, huh?

637
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,690
那我呢
How about me?

638
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:50,580
在亲眼见证了战争的残酷之后
You gonna make me watch that happen? Huh, Pete?

639
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,810
你还想让我目睹这一切吗 彼特
After what we've seen?

640
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,650
你还要再给我一个无法合眼的理由吗
You gonna give me another reason I can't close my eyes?

641
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:01,720
杰西 你不该来这儿的
You shouldn't be here, Jesse.

642
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:03,860
不 我就该来
Yes, I damn well should!

643
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:10,360
我做过什么好事吗 唯一的好事就是
The hell else am I good for? One of the only good things I ever did

644
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:13,830
把你从那鬼地方救出来 为了什么
was carry you out of that shithole place. For what?

645
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,800
就是为了让你把自己和一群警察
So you can blow yourself all to hell

646
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:19,440
一起炸死吗
and take a bunch of cops with you?

647
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,120
彼特 什么时候才是个头儿啊
Where's it all end, Pete?

648
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,750
你杀了我 接着呢
You kill me, then what?

649
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:30,510
杀了杰西 让卢卡斯在没有父亲的陪伴下成长
Kill Jesse here and let Lucas grow up without a father?

650
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:34,780
杀了外面的警察 让他们的孩子成为遗孤
Kill a bunch of cops out there, let their kids suffer?

651
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:37,690
朋友 只有两种结局
There's only two ways this is going down, man.

652
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,790
要不我们三人一起出去 要不都别出去
Either all three of us walk out of here together, or we don't.

653
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,890
就像其他人一样
And our names get forgotten

654
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,360
我们的名字将被遗忘
just like everyone else's.

655
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,460
你来选择
It's your choice.

656
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,590
再次成为真正的英雄 感觉怎么样
How's it feel to be a bona fide hero again?

657
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,670
走吧 如果快点
Come on, man, if we hurry,

658
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,840
还能赶回去吃你儿子的生日蛋糕
we can make it back for your son's birthday in time for cake.

659
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:43,450
走吧
Let's go.

660
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,260
你好 我是丹妮拉・雷德利
Hi, this is Daniella Ridley. I'd like to speak to someone

661
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:10,470
我想和一个跟领养儿童保持联系的人讲话
about getting in touch with a child who was put up for adoption.

662
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,270
有时把枪掏出后 事情迅速变得很疯狂
Sometimes the guns come out and it all gets cranked up to insanity

663
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:18,480
以至于怀疑自己还能不能回到家
and you're down to wondering if you're ever gonna make it home,

664
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,680
但几分钟后
and then a couple minutes later

665
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:23,450
你走出来 像什么事都没发生一样
you're walking out like nothing happened.

666
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:27,220
我更喜欢没人受伤
I like it better when no one gets hurt.

667
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:32,750
我打赌战略小队的人今晚会称你为高手
Tactical guys are calling you some kind of hotshot tonight, I bet.

668
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,720
因为他们嫉妒
Only 'cause they're jealous.

669
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:38,590
再喝一轮
Mmhmm. Another round?

670
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:42,300
我得去个地方
I actually gotta be somewhere.

671
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:46,600
你请我出来然后急着就走了
You invited me out to rush me off?

672
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,940
- 是你请我出来的 - 管它是谁请谁
- You invited me. - He said, she said.

673
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:54,440
我在做的事
This thing I'm doing...

674
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:57,310
希望能帮助我
I hope it's gonna help me.

675
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,580
帮助我们
Us.

676
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:02,920
我们
Us?

677
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:06,090
你懂我的意思
You know what I mean.

678
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:10,620
我喜欢你那么说
I like the sound of that.

679
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,290
很好
Good.

680
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:20,770
那好 我就...
Alright, I'll...

681
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:24,000
再见
I'll see you later.

682
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,920
卢卡斯 我的孩子
So my kid, Lucas,

683
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,650
他想造个火箭
he wants to build a rocket.

684
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:47,190
我说他疯了 他说没有
I say he's crazy, he says no.

685
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:50,290
他有一个DIY工具箱 所以...
He's got this little do-it-yourself kit. So...

686
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,530
我在装推进器时
I'm loading the propellant in

687
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:56,970
突然 我的手开始发抖
and all of a sudden, my hands just start shaking.

688
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,690
我知道那是安全的
I mean, it's safe, right?

689
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:02,370
但 你们懂
But... you know.

690
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:05,110
你最后装完了吗
Did you finish building it?

691
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:09,910
我休息了会儿
I took a little break,

692
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:12,410
然后回去把那玩意弄好了
went back and packed that bastard to the gills

693
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,920
接着把它炸掉
and we blew her off.

694
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:19,490
他笑个不停
He couldn't get the smile off his face.

695
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,220
所以 你懂的
So, you know,

696
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:26,360
相当美好的一天
it was a pretty good day.

697
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,970
你想讲讲你的故事吗
You want to go?

698
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:42,140
我叫艾登
Uh, my name is Aidan.

699
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,240
嗯...
And, uh...

700
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:48,550
我需要帮助
I need help.

701
00:42:48,850 --> 00:43:06,850
