the presents from under the tree.

mock my structured fun.

<font color="#ffff00">Your dad never lets us turn up the heat.
.
.

84
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,030
<font color="#ffff00">He just keeps sending me
outside to get more wood.
.
.

85
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,530
<font color="#ffff00">It's really dark out there,
.
.

86

post that looks exactly like a serial killer.

don't you just say no?

can get out of going this year?
.
.

97
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,780
<font color="#ffff00">Oh,my God. No way. We
would crush mom and dad.
.
.

98
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,340
<font color="#ffff00">Can you imagine the guilt?
We'd never hear the end of it.
.
.

99
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,560
<font color="#ffff00">I know. Well,at least we'll be together.
.
.

100
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,420
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah. It doesn't make it
easier,knowing I have you to look at
.

me to have you up there.
.
.

103
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,020

conversations where we make fun of everybody.

<font color="#ffff00">Yeah,I don't know if the cool bartender
would hang out with the weird woodsman.

how funny the labels are.

00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,040
<font color="#ffff00">Uh,listen,about that,we went
to the doctor this morning,
.
.

126
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,590
<font color="#ffff00">and he feels,as a precaution,since
the cabin is in such a remote location,
.
.

127
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,860
<font color="#ffff00">that he doesn't want me to travel.

<font color="#ffff00">So,bad news... Casey and I
are not gonna be able to go
.
.

129
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,440

Christmas this year.

- Yeah,it's a bummer.

to be the gift gnome.

.
.

135
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,700
<font color="#ffff00">yeah,I can see that.
.
.

136
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,920
<font color="#ffff00">I can't believe you're
bailing on Christmas.
.
.

00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,450
<font color="#ffff00">You're using that baby
to get what you want.
.

.
.

141
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,850
<font color="#ffff00">She got her boobs first
even though I'm older.
.
.

142
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,390

She got everything she wanted.
.
.

143
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,720
<font color="#ffff00">And now you're doing the
same thing with the baby.
.
.

144
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,570
<font color="#ffff00">You're using the baby
to get out of Christmas
.
.

145
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,700
<font color="#ffff00">the same way you used your boobs to get free
pop rocks from the gas station attendant.
.
.

146
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,560
<font color="#ffff00">Hey,I make no apologies for that.
.
.

147
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:59,470
<font color="#ffff00">I had already spent my allowance
and I really wanted pop rocks.
.
.

00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,260
<font color="#ffff00">Look,it's not my fault that the
doctor said I couldn't travel,okay?
.
.

151
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,860
<font color="#ffff00">It's one of the few advantages
of my unplanned pregnancy.

<font color="#ffff00">Well,that and the bigger
boobs. Aw,I'm sorry.

baby to get out of Christmas?
.
.

154
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,750
<font color="#ffff00">I know. It's like first

and me and my parents...

<font color="#ffff00">In the dead of winter...oh,God. That's
exactly how "the shining" starts.
.
.

158

<font color="#ffff00">As a hotel manager,I have to ask
you not to mention that movie to me.

could be like the Hales.

- The Hales...

their Christmas vacation in key west,

to be at the lake house this year,
.
.

170
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,020

<font color="#ffff00">I can go to mom and dad

.
.

179
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,170

00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,480
<font color="#ffff00">They even gave me some
presents to give to your dad.
.
.

244
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:49,680
<font color="#ffff00">I told them we're lowering
gifts down to him on a rope.
.
.

245
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,930
<font color="#ffff00">Oh,God. I know. I'm a terrible person.
.
.

246
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,540
<font color="#ffff00">- Can we please just not talk about it?
- Of course.
.
.

247
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,750
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you.
.
.

248
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,700
<font color="#ffff00">Can you believe people used
to get dressed up to travel?
.
.

249
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,080
<font color="#ffff00">Now look at everyone... sweat
suits,flip-flops,antler hats.
.
.

250
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,930
<font color="#ffff00">Oh,my God! Mia and Casey are here.
.
.

251
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,470
<font color="#ffff00">We can't let them see us in line
for key west.They'll know we lied!
.
.

252
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,810
<font color="#ffff00">- Okay. Here. Put this on.
- Why?
.
.

253
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,450
<font color="#ffff00">They think we're going to Michigan
to visit your dad in a well!
.
.

254
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,720
<font color="#ffff00">They can't see us dressed like this.
.
.

255
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,570
<font color="#ffff00">This is a ladies' turtleneck.
.
.

256
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:27,710
<font color="#ffff00">Just arch your back and work it!
.
.

257
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,710
<font color="#ffff00">Wait. They're not supposed
to be here,unless...
.
.

258
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,410
<font color="#ffff00">Oh,my God! They lied,too.
.
.

259
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:39,970
<font color="#ffff00">So,uh,is that the kind of Christmas crap
your parents would never let you have?
.
.

260
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:44,120
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah. But I might be making them out
to seem worse than they actually were.
.
.

261
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:48,450
<font color="#ffff00">Every year they would get me
one store-bought present,too.
.
.

262
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,710
<font color="#ffff00">A marshmallow!
.
.

263
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,860
<font color="#ffff00">So are you excited? Our
first vacation together!
.
.

264
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,680
<font color="#ffff00">I am. I am. I just feel a little
guilty about telling my parents
.
.

265
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,250
<font color="#ffff00">and Maddie that the doctor
said I couldn't travel.
.
.

266
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,540
<font color="#ffff00">Was that really bad?
.
.

267
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:08,040
<font color="#ffff00">Well... You lied and used our baby to get
out of spending Christmas with your family.
.
.

268
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,290
<font color="#ffff00">That's pretty terrible,no
matter how you look at it.
.
.

269
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,660
<font color="#ffff00">You know,I love that
you tell it like it is,
.
.

270
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,610
<font color="#ffff00">but I wish sometimes you
would just tel like it isn't.
.
.

271
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,950
<font color="#ffff00">Hello,gnome.
.
.

272
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,000
<font color="#ffff00">Hello,Maddie.
.
.

273
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,780
<font color="#ffff00">I guess your doctor/travel
agent changed his mind.
.
.

274
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,730
<font color="#ffff00">Yes! Yeah,it was good
news. I just,you know...
.
.

275
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,230
<font color="#ffff00">yeah,you had the baby? That's
great. I'd love to meet him.
.
.

276
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:44,570
<font color="#ffff00">Dude. That shirt does not fit.
.
.

277
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,010
<font color="#ffff00">Well,I happen to like
a three-quarter sleeve
.
.

278
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:49,700
<font color="#ffff00">and a lot of pressure
on my Adam's apple.
.
.

279
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,600
<font color="#ffff00">So I lied. But you lied,too.
You're in a sundress,
.
.

280
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:59,070
<font color="#ffff00">and there is no flight
to Michigan around here.
.
.

281
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,720
<font color="#ffff00">You two are just gonna let
Ben's dad rot in a well.
.
.

282
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,010
<font color="#ffff00">I think that was part of the lie.
.
.

283
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,990
<font color="#ffff00">It's pretty easy to get out of a well.
.
.

284
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,270
<font color="#ffff00">Your lie was worse. You
are allowed to travel!
.
.

285
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,100
<font color="#ffff00">You're using that baby like
a pair of brand-new boobs.
.
.

286
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,330
<font color="#ffff00">Oh,get over the boobs,Maddie!
.
.

287
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,710
<font color="#ffff00">You were a late bloomer,but
you got your boobs... sorta.
.
.

288
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,850
<font color="#ffff00">Hey. Hey,hey.
.
.

289
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,230
<font color="#ffff00">They're bigger than they look.
.
.

290
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,670
<font color="#ffff00">Please stop telling people that!
.
.

291
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,390
<font color="#ffff00">Oh,I can't even deal with you right
now.We're getting on the plane.
.
.

292
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,450
<font color="#ffff00">- Okay,great. Good-bye.-
Good-bye to you.
.
.

293
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,350
<font color="#ffff00">Oh,are you kidding me?
You're going to key west,too?
.
.

294
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:41,210
<font color="#ffff00">What's the big deal? I just
wanted to go someplace tropical.
.
.

295
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,230
<font color="#ffff00">I've wanted to ever since
Mr. hale winked at me.
.
.

296
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,230
<font color="#ffff00">The Hales.
.
.

297
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,540
<font color="#ffff00">Buddy,your shirt is riding up.
.
.

298
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,650
<font color="#ffff00">I know.
.
.

299
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,000
<font color="#ffff00">I'm workin' it.
.
.

300
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,780
<font color="#ffff00">Attention,key west passengers,
.
.

301
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,000
<font color="#ffff00">due to a weather delay,we
are deplaning all passengers.
.
.

302
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,960
<font color="#ffff00">Please stand by for further notice.
.
.

303
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,690
<font color="#ffff00">When they find out you lied,mom
and dad are gonna be so mad at you.
.
.

304
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,960
<font color="#ffff00">They've texted me 3 times in 20
minutes to tell me how lonely they are.
.
.

305
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,690
<font color="#ffff00">They don't seem lonely.
.
.

306
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,660
<font color="#ffff00">I have never been deplaned
before. This is outrageous.
.
.

307
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:26,060
<font color="#ffff00">We should get some sort
of a voucher for this. I...
.
.

308
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,820
<font color="#ffff00">This isn't the lake house.
.
.

309
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,250
<font color="#ffff00">What are you guys doing here?
.
.

310
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:42,790
<font color="#ffff00">What are we doing here? What
are you girls doing here?
.
.

311
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,960
<font color="#ffff00">- Well,they obviously lied to us.
- Hey,you're here,too.
.
.

312
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,830
<font color="#ffff00">We're only here because
all our children ditched us.
.
.

313
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,200
<font color="#ffff00">So we decided to go somewhere
where... where we could rest
.
.

314
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:58,300
<font color="#ffff00">and get a tan and... and be sad
.
.

315
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,950
<font color="#ffff00">because of what you did to us.
.
.

316
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,450
<font color="#ffff00">And you're going to key west,too?
.
.

317
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,790
<font color="#ffff00">Well,we just... we wanted
to be like the Hales.
.
.

318
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:08,140
<font color="#ffff00">Do you remember the Hales?
.
.

319
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:22,200
<font color="#ffff00">Did the Hales just wander
the halls winking at people?
.
.

320
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,000
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know what you're so angry about.
.
.

321
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,060
<font color="#ffff00">You're the ones that
left us sad and lonely.
.
.

322
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,570
<font color="#ffff00">And you're on a plane to Florida.
.
.

323
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,100
<font color="#ffff00">Oh,and you texted me,"the lake
house has never been so empty.
.
.

324
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,160
<font color="#ffff00">There aren't enough tissues
to catch all the tears."
.
.

325
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,800
<font color="#ffff00">We thought that if we
made you feel bad enough,
.
.

326
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,810
<font color="#ffff00">we could guilt you into coming back
to the lake house again next year.
.
.

327
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,220
<font color="#ffff00">Why? Nobody even likes
having Christmas there.
.
.

328
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,560
<font color="#ffff00">Mia hates being the gift gnome.
.
.

329
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:48,380
<font color="#ffff00">Everybody ignores my itineraries,and
Ben's scared to go outside.
.
.

330
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,030
<font color="#ffff00">Who even wants to go anymore?
.
.

331
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,680
<font color="#ffff00">We do. It's our only
true family tradition.
.
.

332
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,360
<font color="#ffff00">We've been taking you girls
up there since you were babies.
.
.

333
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,900
<font color="#ffff00">And now you're having
babies of your own,
.
.

334
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,320
<font color="#ffff00">and when it became clear that you
didn't want to go back there...
.
.

335
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,320
<font color="#ffff00">It broke our hearts.
.
.

336
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:06,080
<font color="#ffff00">I mean,sure,the endless chorus of "let's
all ride the cider train" gets annoying.
.
.

337
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,140
<font color="#ffff00">And the gift gnome gets a
little bitchy by the end.
.
.

338
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,560
<font color="#ffff00">And it's exhausting to check
the thermostat 80 times a day
.
.

339
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,740
<font color="#ffff00">to make sure no one's
turned on the heat.
.
.

340
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,480
<font color="#ffff00">But it's a tradition,
.
.

341
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,400
<font color="#ffff00">and your father and I would
like to keep it that way.
.
.

342
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:26,120
<font color="#ffff00">I-I never realized how
much it meant to you.
.
.

343
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,380
<font color="#ffff00">I guess you guys are
right. I did ruin Christmas.
.
.

344
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,410
<font color="#ffff00">No. It was me. I was the
fit one who got out of it.
.
.

345
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,720
<font color="#ffff00">It's not ruined yet.
.
.

346
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,850
<font color="#ffff00">Our flight's delayed.
We're all here together.
.
.

347
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,710
<font color="#ffff00">Why don't we have a
little Christmas right now?
.
.

348
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,720
<font color="#ffff00">- What do you mean?
- There's a tree right over there.
.
.

349
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,230
<font color="#ffff00">We all run to the gift shop,get a bunch
of crap to give each other as presents,
.
.

350
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,690
<font color="#ffff00">have a little
Christmas,uh,before we leave.
.
.

351
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,160
<font color="#ffff00">- That's a great idea,son.
- All right.
.
.

352
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,750
<font color="#ffff00">Hey,Ben.You look a little
flushed. Are you getting sick?
.
.

353
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,320
<font color="#ffff00">I'd rather not say.
.
.

354
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,590
<font color="#ffff00">Oh,my God. I love it!
.
.

355
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,230
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah,it's a robot dog
that flips onto its back.
.
.

356
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,910
<font color="#ffff00">Needs batteries. Serves no purpose.
.
.

357
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,660
<font color="#ffff00">Will break in five minutes.
.
.

358
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:14,010
<font color="#ffff00">It's perfect.Oh,that...
thank you so much.
.
.

359
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:19,940
<font color="#ffff00">Oh,and thank you for the phone charger
that charges the kind of phone I don't have.
.
.

360
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:24,630
<font color="#ffff00">Oh,and here are three
more gifts for Ben. Oh.
.
.

361
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:30,440
<font color="#ffff00">All right.Cough syrup,cough
