1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Now after the last video, I really didn't like how the painting was going so I wanted to tweak around the colors a little bit.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I've got it to this far, but if I apply the final look to this painting right now, we can see that the characters are very dark.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And they're a little bit too dark actually.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So I'm going to press work mode again and adjust my colors.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
To adjust my colors, I'm going to press control U, which will bring up hue and saturation.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And from here, I'm going to make the cowboys lighter.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm going to make sure that I'm going to make these cowboys lighter than the background as well.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This way they'll feel like they're in the spotlight.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And then when I'm done, when I'm done all four cowboys, I'm going to go up to my actions and make sure that I have my folder selected.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And I'm going to press the finished look button and press play.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And now this is looking much better, so I continue on with this.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And let's go back into our work mode and start colorizing the rest of the elements.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So I'm going to start off with this tall guy again.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And the first thing I want to do is I want to find which layer he's on over here.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So he's on layer number 8.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So having layer number 8 selected, I'm going to control click on layer 8.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And then I'm going to go down to the new layer button, click on that to create a new layer just above layer 8 and just underneath layer 7.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So that I don't end up painting on top of the cowboy on layer 7.

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Now a couple of things that go through my head as I'm painting all the different elements for this cowboy is what will it look like as a finished look?

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I want to take into consideration the fact that the colors will change.

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The colors will get richer, they'll get more saturated.

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So therefore the colors that I choose will be a lot less saturated just to compensate for what I feel is going to happen once I press the finished look button.

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
This is something that you can actually develop a sense for.

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Just over time and practice, you'll develop a sense for what the color will end up looking like after you do all the treatment onto it.

25
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Now as you can see with this technique, it is combinable with the first lesson.

26
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And you're going to find the same similarities in all the classes. They're all combinable, all these different techniques.

27
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So by the end of it, you would have learned so many different techniques that are all combinable to any kind of style.

28
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And you're going to find that your possibilities of making digital painting will be endless.

29
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The main thing is you want to be able to really understand every lesson.

30
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And that can be best done through practice and just playing these videos over and over and following them step by step.

31
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That's the best way to get as much from these videos as possible.

32
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Now remember, if your selection is really bothering you and you don't want to see that, then all you need to do is press Ctrl H to hide it.

33
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The thing about this is a lot of people will tend to forget that they've hidden a selection.

34
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So when it's about time to start painting outside of this selection, they think that their pen doesn't work or something, and they don't know what to do.

35
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,000
If this ever happens to you when you start painting on a layer and you know that it's visible and the opacity has been turned up on this layer,

36
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:49,000
if nothing is showing up, the best thing to do is to press Ctrl D, and that will deselect everything.

37
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Then try to see if you can paint.

38
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Most often than not, that will solve your problem.

39
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:09,000
At one point or another, you might be thinking to yourself, now why do I need to set this folder to this certain setting,

40
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and why do I need to duplicate it and set the top layer to overlay, the bottom layer to color?

41
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What is the deal with all this stuff?

42
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:34,000
If I just paint with a lot more color, then I won't have to compensate for the color changing more saturated when you apply all the finished treatment to it.

43
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Well, that's because the final look that we see after we click the Finish Look mode is a combination of things.

44
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's only because there's a certain specific combination of certain settings that will give us this final look.

45
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You would not be able to achieve this look with just having, say, a color mode or an overlay mode.

46
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's only because of these two things combined that we can achieve this final look.

47
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Now why is it that we have to always revert back to a work mode?

48
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Why can't we just continue to paint having the folder set to color or overlay?

49
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Why do we need to set it to normal and then knock down opacity to 80%?

50
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Well, that's because when the folder is set to, say, color mode, it's hard to see exactly where you're painting things.

51
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's hard to see exactly where you're painting them to.

52
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:10,000
If you have the folder set to normal with 80% opacity, then not only do you get a clear idea of exactly where you're painting,

53
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:21,000
but you also get a very clear idea of the drawing underneath and where that is.

54
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Now if you're not liking the colors that are coming out at this point,

55
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:40,000
here's a little checklist that you can do to try and correct this problem and help you pick out some better colors.

56
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The number one thing that I'll think about first is, is it too saturated or is it not saturated enough?

57
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:02,000
The next thing that I'll think about is, I'll ask myself, is this the right darkness?

58
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Does it need to be brighter? Does it need to be darker?

59
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And the last thing that I'll ask myself is, is this the right hue?

60
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And adjust accordingly in your hue and saturation window.

61
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Something else that might help is if you open up a secondary window.

62
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You could do this by going up to Window, Arrange, New Window.

63
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And this has opened up a duplicate window of this document.

64
00:08:46,000 --> 00:09:00,000
We can shrink this one down so that we can always keep an eye on what we're doing to the painting as a whole in the smaller window,

65
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:12,000
as well as paint up close in the larger window so that we make sure that we're painting nice and accurately.

66
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's the same way that we set up in our first lesson, visualizing through darkness.

67
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So for your assignment, I want you to follow this video as accurately as possible through all the different steps.

68
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You might not have to pick the same colors. You could feel free to go and explore all sorts of different color schemes.

69
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:54,000
But the procedure in how you apply these colors, this is what I want you to really pay attention to and do them exactly how it's done in the video.
