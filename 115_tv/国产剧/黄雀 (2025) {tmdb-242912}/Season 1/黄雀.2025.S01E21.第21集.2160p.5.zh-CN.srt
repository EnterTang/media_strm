1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Okay, so now that we've gone through all of the technical stuff, now it's time to apply it to some real situations.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Okay, so can you please open up the file called bigfoot.jpg?

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Now here's the situation. You've drawn your initial sketch for your painting, and you've scanned it in.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You can see that there's little eraser bits here, there's a little bit of texture over here, and there's a lot of red that we don't want either.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The red was what I used for my initial rough.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Okay, I choose red because, and a lot of people they'll use blue, but I just tend to use red because I find that it's much easier, much cleaner to get out of in Photoshop.

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Blue, a lot of times it'll turn out that the computer will pick it up as black.

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So with red it's much easier to get out of Photoshop.

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So what you need to do is open up your channels window. If you can't see it, just go up to window, channels, and from here we're going to click off all these little eyeballs, all the visibility except for the red channel.

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And what that's going to do is it's going to get rid of all the red.

11
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Okay, and once you've gotten rid of all the red, what I want you to do is delete these unwanted channels.

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Just leave the one channel with the visibility in there.

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Okay, and from here we're going to change the image mode, so we're going to go up to image mode and change it to grayscale.

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And now from grayscale we're going to change it to RGB.

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Now why did we need to do all that?

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Well, if we just go back into history a little bit, if I want to change the mode of this image to RGB, I go up here and you can't even select it.

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What you need to do is change it to grayscale first and then it will give you the option to change it to RGB.

18
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Okay, so now we've gotten rid of all the red.

19
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Now it's time to just clean up some of these little bits in here.

20
00:02:49,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So what I'm doing is I'm using a solid brush, just a normal default brush, 100% opacity and 20% flow, but we can make the flow even higher just to make sure that a good amount of white paint is coming out.

21
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And with this white we're going to just zoom right into the picture and paint over all the little specks on our image, all the little unwanted specks.

22
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So I've just zoomed right in so I can see everything in detail.

23
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm zoomed in at 100% opacity.

24
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Okay, so the top corner over here, all that paper texture, I'm just going to enlarge my brush and just paint right on top of it to erase that as well.

25
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Now this will happen to you quite often as well where your initial sketch is still pretty light even though you might have used a black pencil.

26
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So for this all we need to do is go up to Image, Adjustments, Auto Contrast.

27
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Auto Contrast, this will make all the values in your image have extra contrast in there.

28
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Now if this is too dark for you, which I feel it is for me, what I'm going to do is I'm just going to undo that and copy the background layer.

29
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And we're going to do auto contrast to this copy.

30
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Okay, so we can either go up to Image, Adjustments, Auto Contrast, or we can press Alt Shift Control L.

31
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So on a Mac that would be Alt Shift Command L.

32
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And from here we can just turn down the opacity until we have something that we like.

33
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Okay, once we have something that we like we can merge these two together by pressing Control E.

34
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And now we have prepared our line drawing ready for painting.
