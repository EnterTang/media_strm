410
00:00:51,881 --> 00:00:54,714
Come on Ranjeet, it's your turn.

411
00:00:54,841 --> 00:00:56,991
I'm thinking what I'm
going to be doing.

412
00:00:57,401 --> 00:00:59,312
You have been thinking for
five minutes.

413
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:00,278
Patience

414
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:03,229
We are playing scrabblo
not patience.

415
00:01:05,121 --> 00:01:07,112
- What do you want Su Lee? - 18

416
00:01:07,241 --> 00:01:08,560
okay, here we go.

417
00:01:10,681 --> 00:01:17,917
18.19.20.

418
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:19,394
Full cycle to win.

419
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:20,511
Very good. Bravo.

420
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,753
Right. It's your turn now Zoltan.

421
00:01:24,401 --> 00:01:30,920
Hey. Attention. Zoltan's turn.

422
00:01:37,121 --> 00:01:38,679
It's all right. You throw

423
00:01:38,801 --> 00:01:40,871
I'm no bad. What you want

424
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:42,639
5.

425
00:01:46,681 --> 00:01:48,160
- You are getting better. - Yes?

426
00:01:48,281 --> 00:01:50,158
- You are starting to hit
the board. - Good.

427
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:55,158
What happened?

428
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:58,398
You are supposed to throw it
forward not to the backwards.

429
00:01:58,681 --> 00:01:59,272
Where is it?

430
00:01:59,841 --> 00:02:02,150
It's alright. I see it.

431
00:02:07,281 --> 00:02:08,157
Oh me.

432
00:02:08,281 --> 00:02:10,112
It's a good thing you
were wearing a

433
00:02:10,241 --> 00:02:11,230
turban Ranjeet otherwise it would

434
00:02:11,761 --> 00:02:13,991
have gone straight through
your head.

435
00:02:14,361 --> 00:02:16,352
Oh, blimey! You wouldn't
have felt it.

436
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:18,160
You will feel my first in a moment.

437
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,200
Come on Ranjeet.

438
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:22,194
I'm still thinking.

439
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:24,232
Yeah, there are slow thinkers.

440
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:25,510
Shut up man.

441
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,714
We must have time limito. Come.

442
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:34,111
Oh, I'm getting a good one. Sugar.

443
00:02:34,401 --> 00:02:35,231
No goodo.

444
00:02:35,761 --> 00:02:40,232
Quel idiot! Sugar is not
spelled S-H-U-G-A-R.

445
00:02:41,121 --> 00:02:42,270
I think you are mistaken.

446
00:02:42,761 --> 00:02:47,551
You damn fool. Everybody know
sugar is spelled with two Gs.

447
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:53,233
We win! You want game juan?

448
00:02:53,321 --> 00:02:57,280
We no have time. Mr. Brown he
will be here pretty soon!

449
00:02:57,401 --> 00:02:58,629
You frighten you lose?

450
00:02:59,321 --> 00:03:01,835
I bet you blind folded.

451
00:03:03,121 --> 00:03:06,238
Let's see you get double the
top with Your eyes closed.

452
00:03:06,321 --> 00:03:08,232
Easy. Easy.

453
00:03:09,681 --> 00:03:10,830
Closed.

454
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:14,510
One, two,

455
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:19,075
Jamila.

456
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:22,236
Who did this?

457
00:03:22,321 --> 00:03:25,393
Me. I was trying to get
that in top.

458
00:03:25,681 --> 00:03:28,195
Looks like you get it
in the bottom.

459
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:30,231
Are you hurt Sid?

460
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:31,273
Huh?

461
00:03:31,641 --> 00:03:32,312
Are you hurt?

462
00:03:32,641 --> 00:03:34,791
You bend down and
you'll find out.

463
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:37,909
- What is going on in here?
- Not a thing.

464
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,360
- A dart game. - I beg your pardon.

465
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:42,758
Sid was us telling how he
used to dart playing.

466
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:46,032
Well in future Sidney, kindly remember that
the students have more important

467
00:03:46,161 --> 00:03:47,276
things to do, did you get my point?

468
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:49,073
Yeah, and his point as well.

469
00:03:52,801 --> 00:03:54,393
- Good heavens!
- What's the matter?

470
00:03:54,721 --> 00:03:56,518
This door is full of holes.

471
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,032
Maybe it's a wooden worm.

472
00:03:59,361 --> 00:04:00,396
Wood warm.

473
00:04:00,681 --> 00:04:01,238
Yeah, it's alright.

474
00:04:01,761 --> 00:04:05,197
Yes. I just had a telephone
call from Mr. Brown.

475
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:06,390
He says he Would be along later.

476
00:04:06,681 --> 00:04:08,672
Apparently, he is tied
up at his flat.

477
00:04:09,121 --> 00:04:11,635
Oh, blimey. Shouldn't we be
going to untie him?

478
00:04:13,401 --> 00:04:15,232
I was speaking metaphorically.

479
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:18,959
It is better you speako English.

480
00:04:19,081 --> 00:04:21,959
Silence. Now Mr. Brown
may put up With

481
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:24,276
you stupid remarks
but I assure you

482
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:26,357
Will find me a very
different kettle of fish.

483
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:31,080
Excuse me please, what is mean
kettle of fish?

484
00:04:31,201 --> 00:04:34,159
You'll find out. Now, until Mr. Brown

485
00:04:34,281 --> 00:04:37,717
Arrives, I intend to find out what
sort of progress you are making.

486
00:04:38,161 --> 00:04:40,277
You, how are you doing?

487
00:04:42,641 --> 00:04:43,960
How are you doing?

488
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:46,789
Very pleased, thank you.
How are You doing?

489
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:51,040
I'm inquiring about your English.

490
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:53,350
Your English

491
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:55,831
No, no, Hungarian.

492
00:04:57,121 --> 00:04:58,031
You're hopeless.

493
00:04:58,161 --> 00:05:01,551
No, no, look Hungarian.

494
00:05:02,241 --> 00:05:03,674
Sit down.

495
00:05:03,801 --> 00:05:04,631
Thank you.

496
00:05:05,401 --> 00:05:09,952
You. Give me the present
of the verb to move.

497
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:11,957
You know it not?

498
00:05:12,081 --> 00:05:13,673
Well, of course I know it.

499
00:05:13,801 --> 00:05:15,234
Oh good, then you can me tell?

500
00:05:15,801 --> 00:05:18,156
It is not my place to tell you anything.

501
00:05:18,281 --> 00:05:20,351
Okay, then you can tell me not.

502
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:23,592
- You! - Yes, signiora.

503
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:25,950
What is a comma?

504
00:05:26,281 --> 00:05:27,316
Por favore.

505
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:30,879
What is a comma?

506
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:36,121
Comma is when you are
unconscious.

507
00:05:39,361 --> 00:05:44,196
That's a comma. A comma is
a Punctuation mark.

508
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:45,276
Oh, it's alright.

509
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:47,278
I don't think Mr. Brown is
teaching you anything.

510
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:50,190
Master is teaching us
very much English.

511
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:54,155
When I am arrived, not one
body is understand

512
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:58,194
me, now everybody is understand
every thing I am speak.

513
00:05:58,841 --> 00:06:01,719
I see. Well, then in that
case, if someone

514
00:06:01,841 --> 00:06:04,309
will stop you in the street
and ask you the time

515
00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:05,351
what would you say?

516
00:06:11,881 --> 00:06:13,030
That's wouldn't help them!

517
00:06:13,321 --> 00:06:17,758
Oh yes, in my street, it's
all Indian peoples.

518
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:23,078
Silence. You!

519
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:25,276
Yes please.

520
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:28,677
Give ma a collective noun
for a collection of ants.

521
00:06:29,081 --> 00:06:29,911
Aunties.

522
00:06:32,321 --> 00:06:39,238
Not aunts. Ants. Insects.
What is a lot of ants?

523
00:06:39,361 --> 00:06:40,874
I don't use that.

524
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:45,398
Have you never heard of swarm?

525
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:48,673
Yes please. England call
Pakistan a swarm.

526
00:06:50,761 --> 00:06:51,511
Silence.

527
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:54,233
Oh sorry I'm late Miss Courtney.

528
00:06:54,361 --> 00:06:58,115
So am I! I have just been seeing
how your students are getting on.

529
00:06:58,241 --> 00:07:01,790
- Well, I think they're progressing.
- Yes, but in which direction?

530
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:07,952
What have you been saying?

531
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:12,953
Nothing, she is asking some
questions and we are telling

532
00:07:13,081 --> 00:07:14,070
her some answers.

533
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:15,270
Well, that explains it.

534
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,235
Are you going away?

535
00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:20,159
Only for one night. I'm having my flat
painted that's why I can't sleep there.

536
00:07:20,281 --> 00:07:22,272
You're having your bed painted also?

537
00:07:22,801 --> 00:07:27,113
No, just I can't stand the
smell of fresh glass paint.

538
00:07:27,641 --> 00:07:29,074
Where would you be
sleeping tonight?

539
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:31,272
I'll probably stay at the YMCA.

540
00:07:31,921 --> 00:07:35,550
Hey, much better that the YWCA.

541
00:07:37,921 --> 00:07:40,310
I suppose any of you have a
spare room, do you?

542
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:43,755
It would give me much
pleasure for you

543
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:45,758
to Share my humble house,
but unfortunately,

544
00:07:45,881 --> 00:07:47,314
my cousin and his
family and also his

545
00:07:47,441 --> 00:07:49,716
cousin and his family
are staying with me.

546
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:53,191
You've got two families
both living in one house?

547
00:07:53,761 --> 00:07:56,070
Two families both living in one room.

548
00:07:58,281 --> 00:08:01,114
You are very welcome to come
and Stay with me.

549
00:08:01,241 --> 00:08:02,151
Have you got a spare room?

550
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:05,717
No. But I have a very big bed.

551
00:08:07,681 --> 00:08:10,798
Well, thank you for the offer but
I thing it'd better be in the YMCA.

552
00:08:11,321 --> 00:08:15,280
- You can with me stay. - Don't tell
me you've got a very big bed also?

553
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:18,992
No. I have a small bed, better much.

554
00:08:20,881 --> 00:08:22,792
Okay, you stay with us.

555
00:08:22,921 --> 00:08:24,639
Who's Huss? Us?

556
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:26,150
Me and Giovanni.

557
00:08:26,321 --> 00:08:27,913
Sure we've got a room.

558
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,235
I didn't know you share a flat.

559
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:31,113
Yeah, I had to leave my other place.

560
00:08:31,241 --> 00:08:33,277
I had a big fight with the
neighbor because of the noise.

561
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:34,392
What noise?

562
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:38,151
Every night after mid night
guitar practice For one hour.

563
00:08:38,681 --> 00:08:40,831
- Surely you can ask
them to stop. - No.

564
00:08:40,961 --> 00:08:43,270
- Why not? - It's me who
practice the guitar.

565
00:08:46,161 --> 00:08:47,958
And you still practice the
guitar, do you?

566
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:50,276
- No, finish guitar.
- Thanks goodness for that.

567
00:08:50,401 --> 00:08:52,596
Now I practice the drums.

568
00:08:53,281 --> 00:08:53,838
What?

569
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:57,237
That's ajoke. I don't practice
anything. What do you say?

570
00:08:57,361 --> 00:08:59,158
- Will you stay with us?
- Well, I am

571
00:08:59,281 --> 00:09:03,559
Okay, you stay. Hey,
why don't we have a party.

572
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:06,839
That's a good idea.
Everybody comes.

573
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,350
I'll bring a bottle.

574
00:09:09,641 --> 00:09:11,199
Yeah, make it sure
it's not empty.

575
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:13,752
I'll bottle bring.

576
00:09:13,881 --> 00:09:15,155
We'll get us a pizza.

577
00:09:15,281 --> 00:09:16,031
Chicken curry.

578
00:09:16,161 --> 00:09:16,991
Fried rice.

579
00:09:17,121 --> 00:09:17,951
Noodles.

580
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:19,237
Salata.

581
00:09:19,361 --> 00:09:20,191
Guiash.

582
00:09:20,321 --> 00:09:21,071
German sausage.

583
00:09:23,161 --> 00:09:24,150
Duck.

584
00:09:28,321 --> 00:09:30,516
We'll give you a night
you'll never forget.

585
00:09:32,401 --> 00:09:34,596
That's what I'm afraid of.

586
00:09:38,001 --> 00:09:39,150
Well, come in professor.

587
00:09:39,281 --> 00:09:40,077
Oh, thank you.

588
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:42,237
This is the hall, this is the
kitchen, this is

589
00:09:42,761 --> 00:09:46,390
my bedroom, Max's bedroom, this
is the Living room, and this

590
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:47,238
And that's my bedroom.

591
00:09:47,841 --> 00:09:48,910
No, that's the bathroom.

592
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,032
Oh, where am I sleeping?

593
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:52,230
You sleep here on the sofa.

594
00:09:52,321 --> 00:09:54,232
Sure, it's very comfortable.

595
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:07,270
What was that?

596
00:10:08,321 --> 00:10:09,197
What was what?

597
00:10:09,921 --> 00:10:11,149
That awful noise.

598
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:12,271
It's only a train.

599
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:16,232
Only a train! This is worse then
the Waiting room of waterloo station.

600
00:10:16,761 --> 00:10:18,399
Don't worry, you'll get used to it.

601
00:10:18,761 --> 00:10:21,514
They only run every ten
minutes After rush hour finish.

602
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:24,871
I'll never get to sleep
through all that noise.

603
00:10:25,281 --> 00:10:27,351
We'll give you cotton ball
to put in your ears.

604
00:10:27,641 --> 00:10:28,232
Well, I would need it.

605
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:31,239
Hey, we better go get the drinks.
You wanna come with us professor?

606
00:10:31,321 --> 00:10:33,232
Well actually I'd like a bath
if that's alright with you?

607
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:34,794
Okay, we'll be back in 10 minutes.

608
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,394
I left them here on the table.

609
00:10:46,441 --> 00:10:47,794
Where is professor?

610
00:10:47,921 --> 00:10:50,594
- Well he said he was going to have
a bath. - - Okay, come on. Alright.

611
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:52,236
Just a moment.

612
00:11:08,321 --> 00:11:13,395
Hello! Max! Giovanni!
Anybody there?

613
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:35,799
The sergeant! Yes madame!
A burgaler. Don't panic.

614
00:11:35,921 --> 00:11:38,879
Stay where you are and I'll send
a police car around right way.

615
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:50,272
- He's trying to pick next door's
lock. - Don't worry, I'll sort him out.

616
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:52,119
Oh, I do hope this sort of thing
doesn't happen often.

617
00:11:52,241 --> 00:11:54,675
I only moved in here yesterday.

618
00:11:54,801 --> 00:11:57,759
Stand back, I'm going out there.
George, you stay with Mrs. Partridge.

619
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,315
Alright, come quietly.

620
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:08,269
- Oh, look you're making a mistake.
- Could be.

621
00:12:08,641 --> 00:12:10,074
No but I'm staying here
with a friend.

622
00:12:10,201 --> 00:12:10,792
What's the address?

623
00:12:11,361 --> 00:12:12,794
I don't know. I've never
been here before, you see?

624
00:12:12,921 --> 00:12:13,671
I see.

625
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:15,792
Look there's a perfectly
simple explanation

626
00:12:15,921 --> 00:12:17,115
Well, why don't we come
down to the station

627
00:12:17,241 --> 00:12:19,755
And tell it to the perfectly
simple sergeant.

628
00:12:22,801 --> 00:12:29,718
End of part one

629
00:12:42,441 --> 00:12:44,352
Hey, the professor is not out here.

630
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,353
He is not in the bathroom.

631
00:12:46,761 --> 00:12:48,240
Well, he's not out the either.

632
00:12:48,321 --> 00:12:51,279
Maybe he decided to sleep
at YMCA after all.

633
00:12:51,641 --> 00:12:53,279
No, his bag is still there.

634
00:12:53,921 --> 00:12:55,240
He said he was gonna have a bath.

635
00:12:55,721 --> 00:12:58,713
Oh blimey, maybe he has
gone down the plug hole.

636
00:13:00,081 --> 00:13:08,113
A Japanese philosopher has said:
When the person

637
00:13:08,241 --> 00:13:13,235
is not here, he must be somewhere else.

638
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:17,873
We know he's somewhere
else, but somewhere where?

639
00:13:23,161 --> 00:13:24,230
Hey, what's the matter?

640
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:26,240
It's Mr. Brown.

641
00:13:26,361 --> 00:13:28,033
- What about Mr. Brown?
- He's gone.

642
00:13:28,161 --> 00:13:29,276
Gona?

643
00:13:29,401 --> 00:13:32,279
Ten minutes he was here,
now he's gone?

644
00:13:37,681 --> 00:13:39,911
He is not dead, he is uanished.

645
00:13:43,641 --> 00:13:46,633
- Alright, what's your name?
- Jeremy Brown.

646
00:13:47,441 --> 00:13:48,999
- Brown? - Yes.

647
00:13:49,321 --> 00:13:51,516
I suppose that'll make a
change from a smithor

648
00:13:51,641 --> 00:13:54,280
Jones. Now, according to P.C. Barnes,

649
00:13:54,761 --> 00:13:58,071
- you were caught breaking and entering.
- I was not breaking and entering.

650
00:13:58,321 --> 00:14:00,835
- Were you picking the lock?
- Yes, but

651
00:14:00,961 --> 00:14:02,713
- Do you live there? - No, but

652
00:14:03,281 --> 00:14:05,158
Charge: Breaking and entering.

653
00:14:05,681 --> 00:14:07,239
Look, you're making a
terrible mistake.

654
00:14:07,921 --> 00:14:09,354
That's what criminals said.

655
00:14:18,121 --> 00:14:20,555
I demand to see my lawyer.

656
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:23,714
Sid, they've not nabbed you
tonight as well.

657
00:14:23,841 --> 00:14:25,274
Is he one of you accomplicies?

658
00:14:25,761 --> 00:14:28,070
No, I know him. He can voter for me.

659
00:14:28,321 --> 00:14:30,835
He is in a state he ever can't
vote for his own mother.

660
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,351
- What has he done Barnes?
- Drunk and disorderly.

661
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:36,871
- Pardon? - Drunk and disorderly.

662
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:37,672
So am I.

663
00:14:39,761 --> 00:14:41,513
Sergeant, he is the care taker at the
school where I teach.

664
00:14:41,641 --> 00:14:43,279
He will tell you who am I.

665
00:14:44,161 --> 00:14:45,719
You, do you know this man?

666
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:47,031
He's a cop.

667
00:14:48,161 --> 00:14:51,278
Sid, it's me, look! Tell the
sergeant who I am.

668
00:14:52,361 --> 00:14:54,352
Charlie Frenzbaf.

669
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:55,711
What?

670
00:14:56,361 --> 00:14:58,397
Never tell him your own name son.

671
00:14:58,921 --> 00:15:01,230
Oh, take him away. Bring
him back when he's sober.

672
00:15:01,361 --> 00:15:04,512
I'll be your sweet heart.

673
00:15:09,761 --> 00:15:12,992
Now, Mr. Brown or Frenzbaf or
whatever you call yourself

674
00:15:13,921 --> 00:15:15,912
- Brown - Professor

675
00:15:16,441 --> 00:15:19,035
Max! Giovanni! Thank goodness
you're here. Look, tell

676
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:21,072
this, tell this sergeant who am I.

677
00:15:21,361 --> 00:15:22,919
He's Mr. Jeremy Brown.

678
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,759
He teach us to speak the English.

679
00:15:25,281 --> 00:15:27,078
Do you live in 6 Windsor road?

680
00:15:27,201 --> 00:15:30,273
Sure we do. What happened?
Where have you been?

681
00:15:30,401 --> 00:15:32,119
Well, I've got locked out on your
balcony and your

682
00:15:32,241 --> 00:15:33,879
and your Public spirited
neighbor thought I was

683
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:35,798
a burgular and called the police.

684
00:15:35,921 --> 00:15:37,274
So you were telling
the truth, hum?

685
00:15:37,921 --> 00:15:40,196
And I have a good mind to
see you for false arrest.

686
00:15:40,321 --> 00:15:42,312
If you do so, there'll be a
charge of asault and battery.

687
00:15:43,001 --> 00:15:44,195
I haven't asaulted anyone.

688
00:15:44,321 --> 00:15:47,279
No, but I should go now
before I do.

689
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:11,672
Hey, everybody.
We found Mr. Brown.

690
00:16:13,321 --> 00:16:15,039
Now we all have a party.

691
00:16:16,321 --> 00:16:17,720
Hey where is all the food?

692
00:16:17,841 --> 00:16:18,990
We saved you a piece of quiche.

693
00:16:19,121 --> 00:16:20,110
Oh good.

694
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:22,875
Blimey, actually I can do
with the drink.

695
00:16:27,081 --> 00:16:27,672
No drink.

696
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:28,553
No drop?

697
00:16:29,921 --> 00:16:30,831
Si! One drop!

698
00:16:32,081 --> 00:16:34,231
Don't worry professor. I'll
fix everything for us.

699
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:35,396
Max, go.

700
00:16:35,681 --> 00:16:37,239
Okay, I'll go get some beer.

701
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:39,274
Then we'll all have a party.

702
00:16:39,401 --> 00:16:44,873
No, not all of us. I've
made a date with Danielle.

703
00:16:45,321 --> 00:16:47,232
We are going to have a dance.

704
00:16:51,401 --> 00:16:52,993
Enjoy your selves.

705
00:16:53,121 --> 00:16:54,236
We must also be go.

706
00:16:54,321 --> 00:16:55,276
Yes

707
00:16:55,401 --> 00:16:58,359
Master, Ali will let me
watch his television.

708
00:16:58,641 --> 00:17:01,360
Yes, we don't want to
Starkers and Cruch.

709
00:17:04,401 --> 00:17:05,629
Husky and Hunsh.

710
00:17:06,081 --> 00:17:07,799
Jolly good. See you at school time.

711
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:11,277
Bye everybody.

712
00:17:11,801 --> 00:17:12,950
Thousands apologies.

713
00:17:13,081 --> 00:17:13,957
Why? What have you done?

714
00:17:14,081 --> 00:17:16,959
Nothing. It's what time are
you going to be doing?

715
00:17:19,201 --> 00:17:20,520
What are you going to be doing?

716
00:17:20,961 --> 00:17:22,679
Take Ingrid for a show.

717
00:17:22,801 --> 00:17:24,712
We're going to see Sweedish film.

718
00:17:25,161 --> 00:17:27,755
It's being all about
Sweedish Nopal.

719
00:17:29,201 --> 00:17:30,714
I think you mean Noble.

720
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,991
That is correct. You'll be
excusing us please!

721
00:17:33,121 --> 00:17:34,395
Yeah, certainly. Have a good night.

722
00:17:38,441 --> 00:17:40,352
Don't tell me you two are
going to the pictures too!

723
00:17:41,401 --> 00:17:48,193
No, not so. See Lee and me
go to bedo

724
00:17:51,761 --> 00:17:54,798
Not together, I'm going home
to read a little red book.

725
00:17:55,281 --> 00:17:57,556
I go sleep home.

726
00:18:06,641 --> 00:18:08,074
Too much saki.

727
00:18:08,201 --> 00:18:09,156
Too much saki.

728
00:18:09,281 --> 00:18:10,555
Hope you had a pleasant night.

729
00:18:13,001 --> 00:18:15,071
That's going to be a
sleeping party.

730
00:18:15,681 --> 00:18:19,151
Not to worry. Now we got
plenty of beer for five.

731
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:20,714
You have even more for three.

732
00:18:20,841 --> 00:18:22,320
Oh not you too Anna.

733
00:18:22,441 --> 00:18:25,239
Yeah, us too. I help Zoltan
mid home walk.

734
00:18:26,841 --> 00:18:27,671
Good morning.

735
00:18:28,321 --> 00:18:29,390
Good night.

736
00:18:33,081 --> 00:18:34,230
Alright then, we are three.

737
00:18:34,721 --> 00:18:38,270
Okay everybody hey,
where is everybody?

738
00:18:38,921 --> 00:18:42,311
- They all went out.
- We've got such nice friends.

739
00:18:43,001 --> 00:18:44,912
Hey, why don't we go down
to the disco?

740
00:18:45,321 --> 00:18:48,631
Yes, it's a good idea. And we
will pick up a couple of birds.

741
00:18:49,081 --> 00:18:50,719
I don't want to pick up a
couple of birds.

742
00:18:50,841 --> 00:18:52,160
Professor is right.
We don't want to

743
00:18:52,281 --> 00:18:54,158
pick up
a couple of birds,

744
00:18:54,281 --> 00:18:56,351
we'd pick up three birds.
One each.

745
00:18:58,121 --> 00:18:59,270
Now you two go on.

746
00:18:59,841 --> 00:19:01,160
Why don't you want to
come with us?

747
00:19:01,281 --> 00:19:04,751
Well, I feel tired and wounded. I think
I'll just turn in for the night.

748
00:19:04,881 --> 00:19:05,870
You sure now?

749
00:19:06,001 --> 00:19:07,275
Yeah, but don't let that stop
you from going.

750
00:19:07,761 --> 00:19:08,511
Okay.

751
00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:10,389
I'll just get ready for bed.

752
00:19:10,681 --> 00:19:12,831
And you'll find some blankets
in the cupboard

753
00:19:21,321 --> 00:19:23,232
Any cotton balls?

754
00:19:23,361 --> 00:19:24,077
In the bathroom.

755
00:19:24,201 --> 00:19:25,520
Thank you, see you tomorrow.

756
00:19:27,361 --> 00:19:28,237
Why is he shouting?

757
00:19:28,361 --> 00:19:29,032
I don't know.

758
00:19:30,641 --> 00:19:31,278
You want a beer before we go?

759
00:19:31,801 --> 00:19:32,995
Sure!

760
00:19:37,841 --> 00:19:44,599
It's stuffy in here! That's better.

761
00:19:50,761 --> 00:19:51,671
Nice party!

762
00:19:52,361 --> 00:19:57,560
Fantastic. You know Max?
I really fancy that Ingrid.

763
00:19:58,001 --> 00:19:59,275
Yeah, you fancy anyone.

764
00:19:59,841 --> 00:20:05,632
That's not true, is it?
I don't fancy you.

765
00:20:28,921 --> 00:20:30,639
Hey, our lights just gone out.

766
00:20:31,681 --> 00:20:33,194
Mr. Brown must wanting
to sleep.

767
00:20:34,361 --> 00:20:36,033
We better go to the disco.

768
00:20:36,161 --> 00:20:37,071
Okay.

769
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:42,230
It's locked.

770
00:20:42,721 --> 00:20:44,313
Hey, professor.

771
00:20:49,161 --> 00:20:52,790
The house was very quiet,
nothing could be

772
00:20:52,921 --> 00:20:56,152
heard. Yet the old lady could
almost feel a

773
00:20:56,281 --> 00:21:00,354
sense of heaving. She listened,
the silence was

774
00:21:00,641 --> 00:21:03,792
opressive. Suddenly there
was a knock at the

775
00:21:03,921 --> 00:21:04,751
window.

776
00:21:10,961 --> 00:21:14,510
Yes, sergeant. Oh, it's not
you again maam.

777
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:18,313
Are you sure it's not the
same fellow? There are

778
00:21:18,441 --> 00:21:22,673
two fellows? Look, I suggest
you just sit there and

779
00:21:22,801 --> 00:21:25,235
wait, go around and see a
neighbor and wait till

780
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:26,874
the constable arrives, okay?

781
00:21:40,401 --> 00:21:41,231
Coming!

782
00:21:42,321 --> 00:21:46,234
Oh please excuse me, the front
door was open. I did knock.

783
00:21:46,361 --> 00:21:47,589
Oh sorry, I was a sleep.

784
00:21:48,001 --> 00:21:49,992
There are burglars on my balcony.

785
00:21:50,121 --> 00:21:50,917
Are you sure?

786
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:54,716
Yes, I saw their evil looks.
They might be opening my

787
00:21:54,841 --> 00:21:55,671
doors now.

788
00:22:00,121 --> 00:22:01,349
The front window wasn't locked.

789
00:22:01,641 --> 00:22:04,360
Oh I see alright leave it with me.
I'll go see what they're up to.

790
00:22:04,641 --> 00:22:06,040
Do be careful!

791
00:22:06,161 --> 00:22:07,071
Yes!

792
00:22:08,401 --> 00:22:09,834
What are we going to do?

793
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:10,950
Break the window.

794
00:22:13,001 --> 00:22:15,879
Max! Giovanni!
What are you doing here?

795
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:16,990
You locked us out.

796
00:22:17,361 --> 00:22:19,158
Yeah, we knocked on the
window next door

797
00:22:19,281 --> 00:22:20,873
and the woman screamed
and ran away.

798
00:22:21,001 --> 00:22:22,275
She thought you were burglars.

799
00:22:22,721 --> 00:22:23,278
Come on, get inside.

800
00:22:23,761 --> 00:22:25,274
Just a moment. I'll go
get the beer.

801
00:22:25,401 --> 00:22:26,993
No, no, no. I'll go get it.
You stay here.

802
00:22:32,841 --> 00:22:34,559
Alright. Turn around.

803
00:22:37,841 --> 00:22:39,160
Now are you sure you don't
mind me staying

804
00:22:39,281 --> 00:22:39,997
Here for the night?

805
00:22:40,121 --> 00:22:43,272
Not at all sir. I think it will be
safer for both

806
00:22:43,401 --> 00:22:45,232
Right. At least I'll get
some sleep.

807
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:46,233
Good night sir!

808
00:22:46,801 --> 00:22:47,870
