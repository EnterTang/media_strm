1
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:21,532
_

2
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,179
There's a vegetarian
restaurant round the corner.

3
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,099
You know, just round...

4
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,060
A couple of streets from
here. Does completely veggie.

5
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,180
I had a falafel. It was nice.

6
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,260
It was OK.

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,420
Did you see the news
on telly last night?

8
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:48,980
No, just wondered.

9
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,779
There were some bits in the
papers, I checked in WH Smiths.

10
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,900
Tiny, you know, but
that's not what I'm...

11
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,700
So, you didn't see News at Ten, no?

12
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,939
No.

13
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,980
Ah, shit.

14
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,340
Oh, well.

15
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,700
Two fellas over there.

16
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,659
Can you believe they voted no?

17
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,100
Can you believe it?
I couldn't believe it.

18
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,739
Yeah, well, not... No, I know, but 18.

19
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,179
You know, it's almost worse
than if they'd kept it at 21.

20
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,859
There would be some honesty in that.

21
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,259
We hate you and, you know, piss off.

22
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,859
At least that would have
been consistent but, yeah,

23
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,979
we'll make you slightly more equal.

24
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,020
Yeah, well, big wow!

25
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,819
Of course it's better, I
know that, of course it is.

26
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:42,940
But, well, it's just...

27
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,819
It's 1994!

28
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,980
You know, Jesus!

29
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,339
That's what this fella said last night.

30
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,899
He said it was good and
that things were changing

31
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,220
but it just makes you...

32
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,140
I don't want to be tolerated, you know?

33
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,020
I've got a bit of falafel in me teeth.

34
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,259
It's impressive when you see it.

35
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,619
The House of Commons. Have you been?

36
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,859
It's bigger than it looks on telly.

37
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,659
I just come down on my own.

38
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,739
I wasn't planning to.

39
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,686
I hadn't thought of it, really.

40
00:02:16,687 --> 00:02:19,219
I mean, I knew the vote was coming up,

41
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,299
the reading of the bill.
I've been following it, but...

42
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,339
Then it was on the front page that
morning that Derek Jarman had died

43
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,380
and, erm...

44
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,499
You know, not like it
was a sign or anything,

45
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,740
I don't believe in all
that, but I just thought...

46
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,299
"Sod it. I should go."

47
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,819
You know, show them that we count.

48
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,939
You know, we do exist.

49
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,540
It does matter, the things
they're talking about, so...

50
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,179
I mean, I'm not a big fan or anything.

51
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,500
I just knew he was important, Jarman.

52
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,459
I've seen his version of The Tempest.

53
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,059
It was the first thing I saw at
the arthouse cinema back home.

54
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,779
I never even knew they were a thing.

55
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,100
And I taped Blue off Channel
4 a couple of months back.

56
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,700
I haven't watched it yet.

57
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,219
That's been the best
thing about sixth form,

58
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,019
is discovering things like that.

59
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,459
No-one at my old school would ever
have gone to something like that.

60
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,500
Morons.

61
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,459
There was this lad in my
year, Darren Hardcastle.

62
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,099
Daz.

63
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,339
All he'd talk about was wanking.

64
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,979
You know, he was obsessed.
It's all he went on about.

65
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,779
And if he wasn't banging on about
wanking, he was punching people.

66
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,579
Wanking or punching.

67
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,099
And I used to think, "This
is what prison must be like.

68
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,020
This is like... 1984."

69
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,459
I couldn't wait to leave.

70
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,899
I ran from that place.

71
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,260
Well, metaphorically.

72
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,259
Well, literally.

73
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,940
They arranged a scrap with
the comp across the field.

74
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,300
I hated it.

75
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,579
We were outside for hours
last night, shifting around,

76
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,779
trying to keep warm.

77
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,979
Most people were in groups, actually.

78
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,379
I don't know if they were friends
or from, you know, Stonewall,

79
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,379
that kind of thing.

80
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,459
There were some banners and
signs and people had candles.

81
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,779
You needed candles because
of how bloody cold it was,

82
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,419
I'm telling you. Flipping heck!

83
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:19,299
And there was a weird mix of
excitement because of what it was

84
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,060
and boredom because it took ages.

85
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,379
And this lad looked at me a
few times while I was there.

86
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,099
I saw him looking.

87
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,899
Caught his eye.

88
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,940
Looked back.

89
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,380
He was...

90
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,420
You know, he was lovely.

91
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,220
I can be a bit shy.

92
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,619
And then finally someone come out,
must have said it had been done,

93
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,139
whatever time it was, late,
come out of the House of Commons.

94
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,299
I couldn't see who they were

95
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,099
and then you heard
everyone starting to boo

96
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,339
and you think, "Oh... "

97
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,299
You know, because we'd been
there for so long because...

98
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,299
Well, I don't know how many
people there were, but enough.

99
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,059
You know, 200.

100
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,380
Enough for it to feel like...

101
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,059
You know, because I'm
used to being on my own.

102
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,779
I don't know anyone else who's...

103
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,800
gay.

104
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,999
And last night, there were loads
of us, and we're nice, you know,

105
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,679
I was looking round and I was
thinking, "These are nice people."

106
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,719
And so you start to think, well, of
course they'll vote the right way.

107
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,920
Why wouldn't they? What
would be the point in not?

108
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,320
You start getting
carried away with reason.

109
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,039
And I know...

110
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,080
you shouldn't do that.

111
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,719
And so this bloke come out and he
must have said they voted 18 and

112
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,439
everyone started to boo cos I
think we had all convinced ourselves

113
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,199
it was going to be 16, you
know, it was going to be equal,

114
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,920
so it was like a... It was
like a kick in the teeth.

115
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,199
And then we all sort of
surged towards the Commons,

116
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,719
towards the doors he had come out of.

117
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,199
It just happened and police
were there, a couple on horses,

118
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,480
that kind of thing and...

119
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,599
And people are chanting and shouting

120
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,759
and just sort of, you know, pissed off,

121
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,959
you know, and there is a bit
of a scuffle and I did think,

122
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,399
just for a moment, "Is this... ?"

123
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,840
Because a policeman's
helmet landed at my feet.

124
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,079
Yeah, but it was nothing
really, and then someone shouted,

125
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,399
"Let's go to Downing Street,"

126
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,399
and so we all marched up there
and there was some shouting outside

127
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,039
the gates for a bit

128
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,479
and then we all went up to
Trafalgar Square and a group of

129
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,160
people started sitting in the
road to block the traffic and...

130
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,240
Well, you go along with
it, but I did feel a bit...

131
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,000
You know, self-conscious, I suppose.

132
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,400
You know, but also, like...

133
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,319
You know, because I was pissed off, too,

134
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,399
and the police were getting a bit...

135
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,480
Well, not mardy but...

136
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,760
It was late.

137
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,559
I think we could all tell it had
run out of steam but we were angry.

138
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,799
That's the point.

139
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,280
And so what do you do?

140
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,760
So we did that for, you know...

141
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,480
... ten minutes.

142
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,880
Then everyone went home.

143
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,319
And then you read this morning
that there were scuffles

144
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,359
between police and a
minority out to cause trouble.

145
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,639
And there was no minority

146
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,799
out to cause trouble,
it was so... piddly.

147
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,920
There was a bit of shoving and
a bit of shouting and that's all.

148
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,959
But to read the papers,
the bit there is,

149
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,680
you'd think it was a kind of riot.

150
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,119
That's kind of
interesting, the distortion.

151
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,879
I've never been a part of something
that's been reported before.

152
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,320
We were all just fed up.

153
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,439
And so I'd missed my train by
this point and this fella, Marcus,

154
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,039
that I'd been sitting in the road with,

155
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,840
he asked if I wanted to go
back to his and I thought...

156
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,239
Well, you know, but what do you do?

157
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,200
I had nowhere to go, and so I did.

158
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,559
That's his name, Marcus.

159
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,880
Of course it is, sorry.

160
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,360
"Mar-cous".

161
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,879
We went back to his,
his flat, and it was...

162
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,039
You know, I mean, it
was fine. It was a bit...

163
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,879
Not... It was OK.

164
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,799
I think I'd thought, and I mean,
this is stupid, I know it is,

165
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,880
but I think I'd thought
people in London...

166
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,559
London is just a place, isn't it?

167
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,319
Like any other.

168
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,640
I suppose you think, London...

169
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,359
You know, I don't mean to sound snobby.

170
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,799
It's not snobby. I'm not a snob.

171
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,239
My mate Sean is proper bourgeois,

172
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,999
though he'd have you believe he's
working class because his dad,

173
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,359
I don't know, once drained
a radiator or something,

174
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,039
but I remember his face when I
told him we had our tea on our laps

175
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,560
on Sunday watching
Bullseye, so I'm not...

176
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,720
... you know, posh.

177
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,399
Anyway, he was asking
what I did, Marcus,

178
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,679
and I told him I was a student
and he said he worked for the BBC

179
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,400
in accounts, so that's
interesting, isn't it?

180
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,763
Kind of. And I'd said from the start

181
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:52,660
that I just needed a place to
stay until I could get a train home

182
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,839
in the morning and he said that was OK.

183
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,880
I was giving off the
right vibes, I think, so...

184
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,160
Yeah, it was cool.

185
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,480
He's a lot older than
me. He's 30, but he was...

186
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,239
You know, nice.

187
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,120
He made us some toast and put
the heat on, so it was fine.

188
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,920
He had this jam that's
made without any sugar.

189
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,319
And we talked a bit. He said he'd
been on a few marches and things.

190
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,879
You know, not just gay, but other stuff.

191
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,960
Poll tax, and...

192
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,479
You know, so it was interesting.

193
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,080
We talked about last night and
called them bastards and put the...

194
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,760
What is it? Put the world to rights.

195
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,479
And then he said, "Well, at least
that means you're legal now."

196
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,960
You know, because I'm 18.

197
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,839
I mean, I'm actually 17
but I'd told him I was 18

198
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,080
because I thought 17
sounded a bit young.

199
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,960
That's stupid, isn't it?

200
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,240
And I think when he
said that, I thought...

201
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,479
"Right... "

202
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,520
You know?

203
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,519
I just kind of laughed it off and
then he said he should go to bed

204
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,999
and he went to get some
bedding for me for the sofa

205
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,399
and I think he thought I was
a virgin, which I'm not, but...

206
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,440
I mean...

207
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,920
Well, I'm not not a virgin.

208
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,880
But when he came back in the
living room with the bedding...

209
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,920
... he was starkers and I thought...

210
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,559
"Blimey!"

211
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,199
You know, but then I thought,
maybe that's just what he does.

212
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,039
Sean, my mate, sleeps in the nude.

213
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,520
It never occurred to me
that was a thing you could do

214
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,100
until I stopped round his.

215
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,999
Well, a lot hadn't occurred to
me until I stopped round his.

216
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,919
But anyway, so I was
sitting down on the sofa

217
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,519
and he dropped the duvet
and pillows next to me.

218
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,479
The duvet didn't have a cover on it.

219
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,159
The things that go through your head!

220
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,600
You know, I thought, "Mum
would never give someone a duvet

221
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,120
without a cover on it."

222
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,679
So then,

223
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,800
he was there...

224
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,600
You know, "Hello, boys!"

225
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,280
So I'm kind of...

226
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,759
And then he reached his hand out
and he stroked the back of my head,

227
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,200
just softly, and... that
was actually quite nice.

228
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,759
That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?

229
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,519
I'm not an idiot, I knew what...

230
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,319
Well, you know, cards were
on the table, but I thought,

231
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,799
he's letting me stay
over and he's not...

232
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,799
Well, he's quite nice,
you know, looking, I mean.

233
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,440
He's all right. He's not
Kristian Schmidt, but...

234
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,040
So I put him in my mouth.

235
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,120
And that seemed to go down well.

236
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,399
And then a minute or two later
he stood me up and he kissed me

237
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,799
and I thought, "Right,
I've got to decide now,

238
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,439
you know, if I'm not up for this,

239
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,239
I've kind of got to say something now

240
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,919
because you don't want to be rude."

241
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,959
But I didn't say anything and so
he led me through into his bedroom

242
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,159
and he said, "Is this all right?"

243
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,759
And genuinely, for a split second,

244
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,479
I thought he was asking about
his room, and I did think,

245
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,519
"Well, now we know what Athena
does with its remaindered stock."

246
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,959
But he had my top off by that point
and I felt kind of separate to it,

247
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,999
like I was watching myself, you know,

248
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,359
like Brecht, verfremdungseffekt.

249
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,959
And I was kind of
talking to myself, saying,

250
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,719
"Is this all right? Is this OK?"

251
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,080
You know, keeping
calm. In my head, not...

252
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,840
No, I think that might have put him off.

253
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,240
But it was just nice not
to be rushed because...

254
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,079
I suppose everything
I've done up till now

255
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,160
has been at parties with
lads from college who...

256
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,119
Well, you've got to sort of
take advantage of the moment.

257
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,559
I say lads, it makes it sound
like there's hundreds of them,

258
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,640
there's not, believe
me, really just me and...

259
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,240
Well, just me and
Jamie Flynn, I suppose.

260
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,640
And Sean.

261
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,720
We...

262
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,160
Not, not regularly, you know, not...

263
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,959
If he's drunk and in the right mood,

264
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,319
and I kind of know how to be in
the right place at the right time,

265
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,279
but... Well, it's an art
more than it is a science

266
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,319
and you've either got one
eye on the door or worse,

267
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,479
you've got to kind of prep yourself
in case he loses the mood or after

268
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,319
decides it didn't happen.

269
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,640
I don't mean nasty, but just...

270
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,519
So it was really the first time
it felt legitimate doing anything...

271
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,800
you know, with an accountant!

272
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,919
I didn't have a clue what I was
doing, I'll be honest, but...

273
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,960
Well, he didn't...

274
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,760
You know, he was nice, patient.

275
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,599
He kept talking to me
and checking I was OK.

276
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,199
I almost wished he wouldn't.

277
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,440
I almost wanted him to just go for it.

278
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,919
Almost.

279
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,999
And I think, weirdly,

280
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,399
and this feels weird now
I come to think about it,

281
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,799
but I think because I
didn't madly fancy him,

282
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,319
it meant I could relax a bit more.

283
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,440
It didn't seem as important
as it might have done.

284
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,600
I could just do what he told me
and weirdly that was kind of easier.

285
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,800
I think...

286
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,960
I mean, it wasn't easy really, but...

287
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,839
While we were doing it... I can't
believe I'm telling you all this.

288
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,639
I had a real coffee earlier.
I think it's kicking in.

289
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,959
There was a moment where I was thinking,

290
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,759
"Two hours ago I was outside Parliament

291
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,839
and they were saying I
wasn't allowed to do this,"

292
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,919
and that made me laugh,
and that turned him on

293
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,319
because I think he thought it
meant I was getting into it,

294
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,319
and I was getting into
it, but not because of...

295
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,940
Not just because of him. I was
thinking about all the tossers

296
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,239
who'd opposed it, opposed me,

297
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,759
and I was thinking, "If you
could fucking see me now."

298
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,480
You know, fucking...

299
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,799
And that felt great.

300
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,560
Oh, I felt great.

301
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,839
You know, who'd have predicted
I'd spent my first time

302
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,319
thinking about Lady Olga Maitland
and Sir Nicholas fucking Fairburn.

303
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,479
I doubt anyone's ever thought about
them while they're doing it before,

304
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,359
including the people they're doing
it with, if they do ever do it,

305
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,760
the desiccated twats.

306
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,720
I wasn't dwelling on them. I'm not
a pervert. But it did give it a...

307
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,800
A frisson.

308
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,760
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

309
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,360
I've never said frisson before.

310
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,520
I've only ever seen it written down.

311
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,879
That's one of those
words, you know, like...

312
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,920
hyperbole.

313
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,279
And then,

314
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,479
after, he turned the
light off and he held me

315
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,920
while he fell asleep and...

316
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,160
... all I could think was...

317
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,600
... "I hope Mum and Dad weren't
watching the TV news," because...

318
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,879
At one point, when we surged
towards the doors of the Commons,

319
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,800
that's when I'd seen the cameras.

320
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,479
They had these big lights on
the top of them, the cameras.

321
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,160
You know, like spotlights,
because it was dark, obviously.

322
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,919
I'd been trying to stay behind
this big bloke in front of me

323
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,879
so I wouldn't be seen,
but he moved out of the way

324
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,999
just at the same moment
that one of them swung round

325
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,520
and I know it got me full in the face.

326
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,400
If that's been on the
News at Ten, I'm dead.

327
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,200
So that's why I wondered
if you'd seen it.

328
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,280
Well, I'll find out later
today, you know, when I get back.

329
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,279
I mean, I was thinking about
him as well, you know, Marcus.

330
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:39,039
I was thinking, "He could get
in trouble for this," but...

331
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,999
But then I thought, "Yeah, but
who's going to say anything?"

332
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,360
I mean, who is? Who really cares?

333
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,200
Quite dry, aren't they, falafels?

334
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,959
My friend Elisa, she's a vegetarian.
I mean, not just a vegetarian,

335
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,440
she's quite fussy as well, you
know, fries everything in water.

336
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,480
She's got this...

337
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,960
Futon? No, tofu, instead of chicken.

338
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,160
Have you tried it?

339
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,320
I had some once.

340
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,360
I wouldn't go mad.

341
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,120
It's not really a substitute.

342
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,520
He's got his hand on his leg now.

343
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,600
Those two blokes.

344
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,120
It's just nice to see.

345
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,520
You know, Nottingham, there's nothing.

346
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,680
Gatsby's, MGM the first
Monday of every month.

347
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,080
But, here...

348
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,680
Well, it's not lunchtime yet.

349
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,079
My two hopes are that there
won't be much coverage of it

350
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,559
and that's a good bet, and
that it won't be on at all,

351
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,679
or that they will only
show one or two seconds

352
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,439
so I'll be really unlucky if I'm on it,

353
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,720
or that Mum and Dad
weren't watching last night.

354
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,161
Or that they were
watching and I was on it

355
00:18:04,162 --> 00:18:05,479
but they didn't see me because

356
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,679
they won't be looking for me.

357
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,280
They won't be expecting me to be on it.

358
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,000
They'll think I stayed
around Sean's last night.

359
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,560
I'm kind of looking forward
to telling him about it, Sean.

360
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,920
I think I'll feel a bit
better around him now.

361
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,280
You know, it was good fun.

362
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,479
It's funny, isn't it?
Because if they'd said yes,

363
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,240
if they had made it 16...

364
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,440
... then I'd have gone straight home.

365
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
