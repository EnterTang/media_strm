1
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,979
这就是那位八卦女吗
Is that the Gossip?

2
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,300
不对  她是个荡妇
No, that's the Slut.

3
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,030
她不是荡妇  她很会调情
She's not a slut. She's a flirt.

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,801
她和真人秀上的几个男人发生过关系
How many guys on the show has she hooked up with?

5
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:22,831
节目里有多少男的
How many guys are on the show?

6
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:29,391
戴着那副眼镜对她可没什么用
She's not gonna fool anyone with those glasses.

7
00:00:31,461 --> 00:00:33,081
给  把这个交给戴安
Here. Bring this to Diane.

8
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:34,271
这是什么
What is it?

9
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:35,461
什么也不是
Nothing.

10
00:00:38,302 --> 00:00:40,931
好吧  真人秀就是要"真实"
Okay,  reality, you know, as in "Real,"

11
00:00:40,932 --> 00:00:43,042
就是"记录下你的所作所为"
as in "It happened and we just filmed it."

12
00:00:43,052 --> 00:00:45,532
你的论点是真人秀就是真实发生的事
Your argument is that reality shows are actually real?

13
00:00:45,542 --> 00:00:48,331
不  我的论点是我们对选手不加限制
No, my argument is that we don't control the cast.

14
00:00:48,332 --> 00:00:49,821
他们做我们看
They behave and we observe.

15
00:00:49,822 --> 00:00:50,871
记录发生的一切
They are as they appear.

16
00:00:50,872 --> 00:00:52,442
-就像唐纳德・特朗普  -等等
- Just like Donald Trump. - Wait a minute,

17
00:00:52,443 --> 00:00:53,132
他可没上过我们电视台的节目
he wasn't on our network.

18
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:53,922
打断一下  我们是回到正题上
That... Let's get back... Excuse me.

19
00:00:53,923 --> 00:00:55,043
我们还是回到问题上来
Let's get back to the questioning.

20
00:00:55,053 --> 00:00:57,123
拜托  拜托  梅兰妮
Please, please. Melanie.

21
00:00:58,673 --> 00:01:00,733
你们节目把我们安排在那顶层公寓里
Your show put us in that penthouse.

22
00:01:00,903 --> 00:01:02,263
给我们备了酒
It gave us alcohol,

23
00:01:02,343 --> 00:01:04,282
还告诉我们节目要有情色内容
and it told us that ratings were dependent

24
00:01:04,283 --> 00:01:05,852
才能提高收视率...
on us pushing the sexual content...

25
00:01:05,853 --> 00:01:07,353
那么你们的确有做情色内容
So you did push the sexual content?

26
00:01:07,354 --> 00:01:08,384
让她说完
Let her finish.

27
00:01:09,724 --> 00:01:13,014
然后你们摄影师拍下了我被侵犯的画面
Then your cameramen kept filming while I was violated.

28
00:01:13,694 --> 00:01:16,203
你们更在意节目效果
Your show was more interested in making good TV

29
00:01:16,204 --> 00:01:17,233
而不是保护我
than protecting me.

30
00:01:17,234 --> 00:01:18,624
这番讲话说的真好
Thank you for that excellent speech.

31
00:01:18,634 --> 00:01:19,213
不是吧...
Come on...

32
00:01:19,214 --> 00:01:21,103
我来问你  梅兰妮
Let me ask you this, Melanie.

33
00:01:21,104 --> 00:01:22,213
照你所说  你被性侵了
You were violated, you say.

34
00:01:22,214 --> 00:01:23,945
但是你不记得你被性侵过
But you don't remember you were violated

35
00:01:23,955 --> 00:01:26,034
因为你当时意识模糊
because you also claimed you were unconscious?

36
00:01:26,035 --> 00:01:28,104
我说过了  节目组给我们备了酒
As I said, the show gave us alcohol

37
00:01:28,105 --> 00:01:30,035
-和一点食物  -那家伙是谁
- and very little food. - Who is that guy?

38
00:01:30,205 --> 00:01:31,824
-我去查查看  -好
- I can find out. - Yes.

39
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:33,565
别  让杰去
No. Get Jay.

40
00:01:33,755 --> 00:01:35,944
-我来吧  -你知道你被性侵的唯一原因
- I'm fine. - the only reason you know you were violated

41
00:01:35,945 --> 00:01:37,794
是因为我们有个制片人停止了拍摄
was because one of our producers stopped the shooting.

42
00:01:37,795 --> 00:01:38,845
那已经是第二天了
Not until the next day.

43
00:01:38,846 --> 00:01:42,725
那你怎么不向布雷克索赔450万
So why aren't you suing Blake for $4.5 million?

44
00:01:42,726 --> 00:01:45,106
他才是对你实施性侵的人  对吧
He was the cast member who violated you, right?

45
00:01:45,116 --> 00:01:46,805
为什么要让我们承担责任
Why are we the ones so honored?

46
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:49,245
我觉得布雷克和我一样  是受害者
I think that Blake was a victim, just like me.

47
00:01:49,246 --> 00:01:52,145
梅兰妮  他在你意识模糊时和你发生性行为
Melanie, he had sex with you while you were unconscious.

48
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:53,406
这不是你说的吗
That's what you claim.

49
00:01:53,436 --> 00:01:55,396
我还是不懂为什么不把他抓起来
I'm still not sure why he's not in handcuffs.

50
00:01:55,397 --> 00:01:57,147
作为女人  我就会这么做
As a woman, that's what I would want.

51
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:00,956
-但因为我们财力雄厚  所以  -反对
- But I guess we're the deep pockets here, so... - Objection.

52
00:02:00,957 --> 00:02:03,407
你记得这份合同吗  克拉克女士
Do you recognize this contract, Ms. Clark?

53
00:02:04,907 --> 00:02:05,777
记得
I do.

54
00:02:06,407 --> 00:02:07,056
那...
And...

55
00:02:07,057 --> 00:02:09,137
你能把这些标记出来的...
would you mind reading for me this...

56
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:11,338
读给我听
highlighted portion right there?

57
00:02:11,928 --> 00:02:13,837
"选手确认了解本节目"
"Cast Member acknowledges that the Show,

58
00:02:13,838 --> 00:02:15,328
"《欲动风城》..."
Chicago Penthouse..."

59
00:02:16,278 --> 00:02:17,497
需要我帮你读完吗
Would you like me to finish?

60
00:02:17,498 --> 00:02:19,318
这和上面写的不符
That is not what happened here.

61
00:02:19,728 --> 00:02:22,837
"《欲动风城》不鼓励性行为..."
"Chicago Penthouse does not encourage sexual behavior..."

62
00:02:22,838 --> 00:02:24,238
你们当然希望有性行为
Of course you encourage sexual behavior.

63
00:02:24,248 --> 00:02:28,019
并对一切因选手间的行为
"and is not responsible for any emotional or bodily harm

64
00:02:28,029 --> 00:02:30,329
造成的情感和身体伤害
"That results from engaging in such behavior

65
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:31,969
"不承担相应责任"
with fellow cast members."

66
00:02:33,249 --> 00:02:34,189
他是谁
Who was that?

67
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:36,168
送外卖的  上错楼层了
Food delivery. He was on the wrong floor.

68
00:02:36,169 --> 00:02:37,399
他的食物呢
Where was his food?

69
00:02:38,109 --> 00:02:39,769
我不知道  在前台吧
I don't know. I think at reception?

70
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,210
要我去看看吗
Should I go check?

71
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,830
好
Yes.

72
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,220
你上季的表现真棒
Hey, you were great last season.

73
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,460
谢谢
Thank you.

74
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,269
你们拿不到450万的
You're not getting $4.5 million.

75
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,910
性行为是双方自愿的
The sex was consensual.

76
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,949
你听到的可不是这样
You just heard it wasn't.

77
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,661
不  我听到的是那女人事先准备好的话
No, what I just heard was a woman who was tightly scripted.

78
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:02,310
-你说笑吗  -"你们节目看着我被性侵"
- Seriously? - "Your show kept filming while I was violated."

79
00:03:02,311 --> 00:03:03,990
梅兰妮可说不出这种话  拜托
Melanie does not talk like that. Come on.

80
00:03:03,991 --> 00:03:05,590
也许在真人秀里说不出
Maybe not on your reality show,

81
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:06,921
毕竟她的人设是一个荡妇
where she's scripted to be a bimbo.

82
00:03:06,931 --> 00:03:08,020
但在这里  她的人设就变成
Instead of here, where she's scripted

83
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,950
瓦莎学院的毕业生了吗
to be a Vassar post-grad student?

84
00:03:09,951 --> 00:03:11,210
好吧  说说你开的条件
All right. What's your offer?

85
00:03:11,211 --> 00:03:13,872
八万  算作删掉她那集的毙稿费...
80 grand. The kill fee for not showing the episo...

86
00:03:14,912 --> 00:03:16,101
你知道这案子你们胜算不大吧
You know you have no case, right?

87
00:03:16,102 --> 00:03:17,981
-不  你知道我们有什么吗  -什么
- No, you know what our case is? - What?

88
00:03:17,982 --> 00:03:19,791
-你的恐惧  史蒂文斯女士  -不
- Your fear, Ms. Stevens. - Oh, no.

89
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:21,501
-我可惨了  -这份合同
- I'm really scared now. - This contract.

90
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:23,011
"你交出所有权利"
"You hand over all your rights,

91
00:03:23,012 --> 00:03:24,421
"不能以任何理由提起诉讼"
and you can't sue for any reason"?

92
00:03:24,422 --> 00:03:27,762
-业内合同都这样  -你们要为此付出代价
- All standard in the industry. - And that's why you'll pay.

93
00:03:27,763 --> 00:03:30,022
你很怕我们在庭上攻击这份合同
You are scared to death we will rip this apart in court.

94
00:03:30,023 --> 00:03:31,632
如果法官认为合同没有效力
If a judge throws out your contract,

95
00:03:31,633 --> 00:03:33,543
节目台就得出这笔钱
reality TV has to play fair.

96
00:03:34,793 --> 00:03:36,603
你别高估自己的能力
You have misread your power.

97
00:03:37,663 --> 00:03:39,042
还有件事  史蒂文斯女士
Uh, one thing, Ms. Stevens.

98
00:03:39,043 --> 00:03:40,402
你可以叫我安德莉亚
You can call me Andrea.

99
00:03:40,403 --> 00:03:42,253
-安德莉亚  -什么事  阿德里安
- Andrea. - Yes, Adrian.

100
00:03:44,344 --> 00:03:46,713
我们正式要求你们提供
Here's our official request for all the footage

101
00:03:46,714 --> 00:03:48,044
案发当天的所有录像
from the day in question.

102
00:03:50,084 --> 00:03:51,524
这是私有财产
That's proprietary.

103
00:03:51,934 --> 00:03:52,904
要打赌吗
You want to bet?

104
00:03:53,924 --> 00:03:57,604
乔什・布里克纳法官

105
00:04:06,005 --> 00:04:07,265
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

106
00:04:07,525 --> 00:04:10,754
我没想到你们因过去一周发生的事
I didn't realize how much on edge you were with

107
00:04:10,755 --> 00:04:13,085
都被弄得紧张兮兮的
what's been going on this past week.

108
00:04:13,425 --> 00:04:15,525
有几位律师被杀
I mean, a couple of lawyers get killed,

109
00:04:15,526 --> 00:04:18,436
你们都觉得自己会成为目标
and you all think that you have targets on your backs.

110
00:04:18,656 --> 00:04:22,086
我本想把这些文件直接扔给你们  但是
I-I was gonna throw those files directly at you, but, uh,

111
00:04:22,486 --> 00:04:24,716
我担心你们会吓破胆
I was afraid you'd wet yourselves.

112
00:04:24,986 --> 00:04:26,996
布莱恩  你能帮我把文件捡起来吗
Brian, could you pick that up, please?

113
00:04:27,096 --> 00:04:28,995
我可能还有用
I may need to use it again.

114
00:04:28,996 --> 00:04:31,037
好了  现在  关于这个
All right, now, with respect to this

115
00:04:31,597 --> 00:04:33,587
证据请求
evidentiary request,

116
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:37,496
谁能给我解释一下这些录像
could somebody please explain to me the footage

117
00:04:37,497 --> 00:04:39,086
-以及相关情况  -好的  法官阁下
- and what's involved? - Yes, Your Honor,

118
00:04:39,087 --> 00:04:40,406
这份材料是私有财产...
this material is proprietary...

119
00:04:40,407 --> 00:04:41,287
录像是重要的...
The videotape is vital...

120
00:04:44,777 --> 00:04:45,948
一个一个来
One at a time.

121
00:04:46,348 --> 00:04:47,538
你先说
You. Go.

122
00:04:48,878 --> 00:04:50,637
你好  法官阁下  安德莉亚・史蒂文斯
Hi, Your Honor. Andrea Stevens.

123
00:04:50,638 --> 00:04:53,158
-很高兴见到你  -谢谢  彼此彼此
- Thrilled to meet you. - Oh, thank you. Likewise.

124
00:04:53,968 --> 00:04:55,897
我们制片人拍摄的镜头
Uh, the footage shot by our producers

125
00:04:55,898 --> 00:04:57,597
有些是非常私人的东西
is sometimes extremely personal.

126
00:04:57,598 --> 00:05:01,198
这些私有材料不能被呈上法庭
This is proprietary material that shouldn't be casually exposed.

127
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,858
事实上  这可能会让我们选手
In fact, it could embarrass,

128
00:05:02,859 --> 00:05:03,808
感到难为情...
potentially, our contestant, so...

129
00:05:03,809 --> 00:05:08,069
这些选手同意让节目在30多个国家播出
These contestants agree to broadcast themselves over 30 countries.

130
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:10,198
但是现在因为诉讼的原因
But now that a lawsuit has been filed,

131
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:12,228
辩方却要保护他们的隐私
the defense wants to protect their privacy?

132
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,299
-这是个什么节目  -一个真人秀
- What is this show? - It is a reality show

133
00:05:14,309 --> 00:05:16,459
名叫《欲动风城》
called Chicago Penthouse.

134
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,160
其中选手的目标
Oy. And the goal of the contestants

135
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:21,409
是在他们中选出自己的绝佳配偶
is to find a romantic match among the other contestants.

136
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,070
如果找不到  他们就得死吗
And if they don't, they get killed?

137
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,039
那就有意思了
That would be interesting.

138
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,820
-不  他们会被淘汰  -真刺激
- No, they get sent home. - Exhilarating.

139
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,479
好了  我来捋一下看我说的对不对
All right, let me see if I understand this thing correctly.

140
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,001
这里涉及到成堆的选手镜头
There's tons of footage of these contestants?

141
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:36,741
而且制片人有权
And the producers retain the right

142
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:40,460
播出任意或者全部镜头  对吗
to use any or all of this footage for broadcast? Is that right?

143
00:05:40,461 --> 00:05:41,871
-没错  法官阁下  -没错  正是如此
- That is correct, Your Honor. - Yes, that's exactly correct.

144
00:05:41,881 --> 00:05:45,270
而且  这堆录像里面就有
In fact... Yeah. And-and somewhere within all of this footage

145
00:05:45,271 --> 00:05:48,682
涉嫌性侵的影片镜头
is evidence of an alleged assault?

146
00:05:48,722 --> 00:05:49,441
-没错  -是的
- Correct. - Right.

147
00:05:49,442 --> 00:05:50,962
那它们就属于
Well, that would be, uh,

148
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:52,731
关键物证  对吗
material evidence, now, wouldn't it?

149
00:05:52,732 --> 00:05:54,341
不  其实  我觉得...
No, actually, what I think is that...

150
00:05:54,342 --> 00:05:55,202
你知道我怎么想吗
You know what I think?

151
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:57,411
我觉得你  史蒂文斯女士
What I think is that you, Ms. Stevens,

152
00:05:57,412 --> 00:05:58,951
应该把录像交给他们
should give them the tapes.

153
00:05:58,952 --> 00:05:59,871
与此同时
And while you're at it,

154
00:05:59,872 --> 00:06:02,802
法庭也需要一份拷贝
supply the court with duplicate copies.

155
00:06:03,352 --> 00:06:04,403
马上
Pronto.

156
00:06:05,173 --> 00:06:06,442
这是个法律术语
That's a legal term.

157
00:06:06,443 --> 00:06:08,523
-好的  法官阁下  -好了
- Yes, Your Honor. - Okay. Well, uh,

158
00:06:09,373 --> 00:06:11,162
我准备敲锤子了
I'm about to bang my gavel.

159
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:14,693
所以如果有人要钻到桌子底下找掩护
So if, uh, anybody wants to take cover under their desks,

160
00:06:14,733 --> 00:06:15,863
现在是时候了
now's the time.

161
00:06:22,974 --> 00:06:24,754
《欲动风城》
第14季  原片

162
00:06:29,274 --> 00:06:31,553
这是录像证据大杂库
That's a video depo dump.

163
00:06:31,554 --> 00:06:32,704
一整季的
The whole season.

164
00:06:32,854 --> 00:06:36,134
十几个摄像机全天候录下来的
24-hour-a-day video from a dozen cameras.

165
00:06:36,135 --> 00:06:39,165
而且他们没标时间没做加注就送过来了
And they sent them over with no time code or description.

166
00:06:39,575 --> 00:06:40,804
全部过一遍得好几周的时间
It's gonna take weeks to go through all of it.

167
00:06:40,805 --> 00:06:41,715
我愿意做
I'll do it.

168
00:06:45,065 --> 00:06:46,105
你来决定
It's up to you.

169
00:06:47,255 --> 00:06:50,064
#It's your birthday happy birthday, it's your birthday#

170
00:06:50,065 --> 00:06:52,586
伙伴们  为第十四季干杯
Okay, guys! To season 14!

171
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:57,095
这是谢丽尔  蒂娜和约翰尼
Okay, that's Sheryl and Tina and Johnny.

172
00:06:57,096 --> 00:06:58,005
穿运动背心的那个
The one in the tank top.

173
00:06:58,006 --> 00:06:59,715
大家都讨厌他  因为他特阴险
Everybody hates him because he's a snake.

174
00:06:59,716 --> 00:07:00,796
杀了我算了
Kill me now.

175
00:07:00,886 --> 00:07:02,556
下一个  这段太早了
Next tape. This one's too early.

176
00:07:03,146 --> 00:07:04,756
有一点我没明白
So here's what I don't understand.

177
00:07:05,136 --> 00:07:07,536
你看着还算半个聪明人
You seem like a semi-half-intelligent person.

178
00:07:07,537 --> 00:07:08,456
谢谢
Thank you.

179
00:07:08,457 --> 00:07:09,727
你怎么还看这个
How can you watch this?

180
00:07:09,947 --> 00:07:11,337
你喜欢橄榄球吧
You like football, right?

181
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,146
得了  你怎么能把这个跟橄榄球相提并论
Oh, come on, you can't equate this with football.

182
00:07:13,147 --> 00:07:15,316
咱们来讨论一下慢性创伤性脑损伤
Let's talk about chronic traumatic head injuries.

183
00:07:15,317 --> 00:07:17,476
我不是对节目里的人有意见
I'm not criticizing what happens to the people on the show.

184
00:07:17,477 --> 00:07:19,917
我是对看这节目的观众有意见
I'm just criticizing what happens to the viewer.

185
00:07:19,937 --> 00:07:21,387
你就没有负罪的快感吗
Don't you have a guilty pleasure?

186
00:07:21,397 --> 00:07:25,187
你就不在油管上看男生跳冰的视频吗
Don't you watch YouTube videos of guys diving onto ice

187
00:07:25,188 --> 00:07:28,247
或者看恐怖电影  漫画书之类的
or watch horror movies or read comic books?

188
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:29,357
你是说连环画小说吗
You mean graphic novels?

189
00:07:29,358 --> 00:07:31,637
天啊  真的假的  这你还取笑我
Oh, my God. Seriously? And you make fun of me?

190
00:07:31,638 --> 00:07:33,668
连环画小说是新兴文学
Graphic novels are a new literature.

191
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:35,818
对  跟斯坦贝克似的
Right. Like Steinbeck.

192
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:35,818
美国作家  曾获1962年诺贝尔文学奖

193
00:07:36,198 --> 00:07:37,349
伪君子
What a hypocrite.

194
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:40,799
等下  就是这  这是最后一次总结场
Oh, wait. Wait, there. That-That's the last Wrap-Up Circle.

195
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:42,649
-你怎么知道  -他们在配对
- How do you know? - They're pairing up.

196
00:07:50,799 --> 00:07:52,399
这是两个不同角度的摄像机拍的
These are two camera angles.

197
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,580
#It's your birthday#

198
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,979
你需要帮忙吗  小美女
You need some help, little lady?

199
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,850
这倒是能证实醉酒
Well, that confirms the drunkenness.

200
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,839
天啊  把泡泡机打开
Oh, my God, turn on the bubbles!

201
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,509
-我太喜欢飞机了  -等等
- I love jets! - Wait, wait, wait,

202
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,980
我没有泳衣
I don't have a-a swimsuit.

203
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,890
我连一件泳衣都没有
I don't even own a swimsuit.

204
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,931
#It's your birthday, happy birthday#

205
00:08:08,981 --> 00:08:10,871
这可不妙
Okay. That's not good.

206
00:08:11,201 --> 00:08:12,901
但这依然不代表同意
Well, it's still not consent.

207
00:08:15,211 --> 00:08:16,910
这不是在公共台播的节目吗
Isn't this on network TV?

208
00:08:16,911 --> 00:08:18,721
对  他们打马赛克了
Yeah. They pixelate it.

209
00:08:21,871 --> 00:08:23,631
这一段会持续一阵子
Uh, this goes on for a while.

210
00:08:33,832 --> 00:08:35,702
这算是同意了  她怂恿人家了
Now it's consent. She just instigated.

211
00:08:35,972 --> 00:08:38,142
-停  -关机
- Cut it. - Cameras off.

212
00:08:39,863 --> 00:08:41,253
他们为什么要藏着这个呢
Why are they hiding this?

213
00:08:42,183 --> 00:08:44,302
如果这个对我们不利  他们为什么还要藏着
I mean, if it's not good for us, why are they hiding it?

214
00:08:44,303 --> 00:08:46,043
可能是录像里的其它东西
It could be something else in the footage.

215
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:47,923
#It's your birthday#

216
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,003
我好无聊
I'm bored.

217
00:08:59,004 --> 00:09:00,224
你抢我台词
That's my line.

218
00:09:01,024 --> 00:09:02,563
大家都觉得我会进监狱
Everybody expected me to be in jail,

219
00:09:02,564 --> 00:09:04,214
所以我没什么事可做
so I have nothing to do.

220
00:09:04,814 --> 00:09:06,313
你去旁听你爸的提审吗
Are you going to your dad's arraignment?

221
00:09:06,314 --> 00:09:08,044
不  我受够了
No. I think I'm done.

222
00:09:08,694 --> 00:09:11,824
很奇怪  一年前  一切都很正常
It's weird. A year ago, everything was normal.

223
00:09:11,825 --> 00:09:13,544
我们每年复活节都办聚会
We'd have a party every Easter.

224
00:09:13,545 --> 00:09:15,935
你今年可以来我家过逾越节
Hey, you can come to my house for Pesach this year.

225
00:09:13,545 --> 00:09:15,934
犹太教传统节日

226
00:09:15,935 --> 00:09:17,975
我甚至还可以给你藏几个复活节彩蛋
I'll even hide a few Easter eggs for you.

227
00:09:17,985 --> 00:09:19,585
我可是会接受你的邀请的
You know, I might take you up on that.

228
00:09:20,045 --> 00:09:21,445
我们午餐应该不醉无归
We should get drunk at lunch.

229
00:09:23,285 --> 00:09:24,325
这是我认识的你吗
Who are you?

230
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:25,804
另一个人了
A different person.

231
00:09:25,805 --> 00:09:27,976
另一种风格的你
A different genre of person. Oh.

232
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,856
-怎么了  -不知道  感觉有点奇怪
- What? - I don't know. Feels a little weird.

233
00:09:37,056 --> 00:09:37,986
糟糕
Shit.

234
00:09:39,456 --> 00:09:42,937
杀死所有律师

235

Don't move.

238
00:11:26,803 --> 00:11:28,333
我们可不想让这东西空气传播
We don't want it to go airborne.

239
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:29,523
等等  这...
Wait, what...

240
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:30,783
这是什么
what is this?

241
00:11:32,284 --> 00:11:33,674
我不知道  可能是...
I don't know. It could be...

242
00:11:34,484 --> 00:11:35,904
是什么  烘焙粉吗
What, baking powder?

243
00:11:37,514 --> 00:11:39,544
不  太偏棕色了
No. Looks too brown.

244
00:11:43,284 --> 00:11:46,264
"我破产了  老婆孩子都没了"
"I'm bankrupt. I've lost my wife. I've lost my kids.

"都是因为你"
All because of you."

246
00:11:48,155 --> 00:11:49,965
要命  信里说这是蓖麻毒
Oh, fuck. It says it's ricin.

247
00:11:51,775 --> 00:11:53,955
跟炭疽一样严重
Th-That's as bad as anthrax.

248
00:11:54,135 --> 00:11:55,145
是的
Yes.

249
00:11:57,195 --> 00:11:58,505
你能够着玻璃吗
Can you reach the glass?

250
00:12:00,545 --> 00:12:01,435
能
Yeah.

251
00:12:10,906 --> 00:12:12,496

254
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:21,617
天啊
Oh, God.

255
00:12:22,177 --> 00:12:23,837
跟另外那两个凶手一样
Just like the other two killers.

通知大家有疑似化学品威胁

264

蓖麻毒
Ricin?

275
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:28,661
卢卡
Lucca.

276
00:13:28,811 --> 00:13:29,751
别过来
Stay there.

277
00:13:43,382 --> 00:13:44,321
你要干什么
What are you doing?

278
00:13:44,322 --> 00:13:45,842
别动
Don't move.

279
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:50,242
卢卡  一小原子的这个东西你就没命了
Lucca, one tiny atom of this stuff, and you can be dead.

280
00:13:50,822 --> 00:13:52,143
是的  如果你继续说话的话
Yes. And if you keep talking,

281
00:13:52,703 --> 00:13:54,003
你就会把它吸进去
you're gonna breathe it in.

282
00:13:54,563 --> 00:13:55,593
所以别说话
So shut up.

283
00:13:58,663 --> 00:14:00,593
这个看着虽然不好看
Now, this isn't gonna look pretty.

284
00:14:00,753 --> 00:14:02,363
紧急救援的来了
Emergency response is coming.

285
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:03,782
他们让你们别动
They don't want you to move.

286
00:14:03,783 --> 00:14:05,472
他们担心你们会把孢子通过空气传播出去
They're worried you'll send the spores airborne.

287
00:14:05,473 --> 00:14:06,793
谢谢  我们知道
Thanks. We know.

288
00:14:06,934 --> 00:14:08,634
这个信封是哪儿来的
Where did the envelope come from?

289
00:14:09,694 --> 00:14:11,093
戴安・洛哈特

292
00:14:20,584 --> 00:14:21,714
这不是演习
This isn't a drill!

293
00:14:21,764 --> 00:14:23,105
疏散楼层
Clear the floor now!

294
00:14:26,005 --> 00:14:27,485
快点
Come on, guys. Let's go.

295
00:14:27,615 --> 00:14:29,114
借过
Excuse me. Excuse me.

296
00:14:29,115 --> 00:14:30,274
-快点  -怎么了
- Come on, come on. - What's up?

297
00:14:30,275 --> 00:14:31,884
快点  快走
Come on, come on. Let's go. Go, go, go, go.

298
00:14:31,885 --> 00:14:33,455
天啊  杰
Oh, my... Jay! Jay!

299
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,305
我们遇上了疑似的化学品袭击
We have a possible chemical attack situation.

300
00:14:41,306 --> 00:14:43,456
别碰你的脸  别碰你的衣服

301
00:14:43,606 --> 00:14:46,206
在楼梯下面等待应急救援
Wait at the base of the stairs for the emergency responders.

302
00:14:46,406 --> 00:14:47,856
快走  快
Let's go! Come on!

303
00:14:55,407 --> 00:14:56,517
出什么事了
What's going on?

304
00:14:56,847 --> 00:14:58,036
疑似化学品袭击
Chemical scare.

305
00:14:58,037 --> 00:14:59,207
什么  在哪
What? Where?

306
00:14:59,377 --> 00:15:00,346
我们那层
Our floor.

307
00:15:00,347 --> 00:15:01,347
客户寄来的吗
From a client?

308
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:02,537
我的客户之一
One of mine.

309
00:15:03,057 --> 00:15:04,497
你老公在这
Your husband is here.

310
00:15:08,037 --> 00:15:09,798
天啊  希望他们都没事
Oh, God, I hope they're being good.

311
00:15:10,898 --> 00:15:13,418
他们刚...他们刚把空调关上
They just... they shut down the air conditioning,

312
00:15:13,428 --> 00:15:14,467
然后我们做了疏散
and we evacuated.

313
00:15:14,468 --> 00:15:16,947
好  让这些人在下面待着
Good, good. Hey, keep these people down here.

314
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:19,578
出现症状的人一概隔离
Isolate anyone who exhibits any symptoms.

315
00:15:19,778 --> 00:15:21,807
危险物质小组马上就到
We've got the hazard material team going up now.

316
00:15:21,808 --> 00:15:24,678
-上面还有我们的员工  -明白
- We still have employees up there. - I understand.

317
00:15:24,688 --> 00:15:26,639
机动医疗组在路上了
A mobile medical team is on the way.

318
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:28,579
-你有空吗  -有
- Do you have a minute? - Y-Yeah.

319
00:15:31,939 --> 00:15:32,688
你没事吧
Are you all right?

320
00:15:32,689 --> 00:15:34,958
没事  我刚才不在  我去吃午饭了
Yeah. I-I wasn't here. I was at lunch.

321
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:35,919
那就好
All right, good.

322
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:37,799
那就好
That's good. Okay.

323
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,870
好了  搜到了  蓖麻毒
Okay, here it is. Ricin.

324
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,300
想听吗
Do you want to hear?

325
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,030
我也不知道  该听吗
I don't know. Do I?

326
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,229
"暴露于蓖麻毒后的一天到两个月之间"
"Symptoms can begin any time between one day and two months

327
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,560
"都可能出现症状"
after the exposure."

328
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,440
就跟验孕一样
Like a pregnancy test.

329
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,601
至少不用在棒棒上尿尿
At least we won't have to pee on a stick.

330
00:15:57,941 --> 00:15:58,711
不好
Oh, no.

331
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:00,231
怎么了
What?

332
00:16:00,521 --> 00:16:01,771
我觉得我要打喷嚏了
I think I'm gonna sneeze.

333
00:16:02,071 --> 00:16:04,151
-别  -控制不了
- Don't. - It's involuntary.

334
00:16:04,391 --> 00:16:06,581
把你的舌头顶在门牙处  有用的
Press your tongue between your front teeth. It works.

335
00:16:09,591 --> 00:16:11,091
好了  奏效了
Okay, I think that did it.

336
00:16:11,862 --> 00:16:13,912
要是我们没死  我今晚要喝个大醉
Oh, if we don't die, I'm gonna get so drunk tonight.

337
00:16:22,042 --> 00:16:24,682
你们好  二位现在怎么样了
Hey there. How are you two doing?

338
00:16:25,522 --> 00:16:26,401

-玛娅  -你们好
- Maia. - Hey.

344
00:16:38,603 --> 00:16:41,523
我们会非常缓慢地把这些全部处理掉  好吗
So, we're gonna take this all very slowly, okay?

345
00:16:42,303 --> 00:16:45,383
你们有人出现了什么症状吗  呼吸困难
Now, do either of you have any symptoms-- trouble breathing,

346
00:16:45,384 --> 00:16:47,234
咳嗽  皮肤过敏
coughing, skin irritations?

347
00:16:47,614 --> 00:16:49,984
我差点就打喷嚏了  但我忍住了
I almost sneezed, but I've gotten it under control.

348
00:16:50,604 --> 00:16:51,534
很好
Good.

349
00:16:51,994 --> 00:16:54,304
我要先给你们戴上口罩
I'm gonna put these masks on your faces first.

350
00:16:54,834 --> 00:16:56,504
用餐巾是个很好的主意
The napkins were a great idea.

351
00:17:02,765 --> 00:17:03,725
大小合适吗
That a good fit?

352
00:17:03,995 --> 00:17:05,384
很合适  能送给我吗
Perfect. Can I keep it?

353
00:17:05,385 --> 00:17:07,884
当然  但不能用它来扮成黑武士
Sure. No Darth Vader impressions, though.

354
00:17:07,885 --> 00:17:08,825
该死
Damn.

355
00:17:09,385 --> 00:17:10,855
好  现在还不要动
Okay, now, don't move yet.

356
00:17:11,665 --> 00:17:14,386
我看见粉末在桌子上
I see there's powder on the desk,

357
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,735
你的膝盖  胳膊和你的手上
your lap, your arm, and your hand--

358
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:17,526
还有别的地方有吗
is it anywhere else?

359
00:17:17,906 --> 00:17:19,146
据我们所知没有了
Not that we can see.

360
00:17:20,116 --> 00:17:23,056
首先  我先带你离开桌子  好吗
So first, I'm gonna move you away from the desk, okay?

361
00:17:26,876 --> 00:17:27,925
我需要你
I'm gonna need you...

362
00:17:27,926 --> 00:17:29,797
-梅丽莎  -梅丽莎

363
00:17:30,047 --> 00:17:31,046
我需要你  梅丽莎
I'm gonna need you, Marissa,

364
00:17:31,047 --> 00:17:32,986
在一分钟内非常小心地站起来
to stand very carefully in one minute.

365
00:17:32,987 --> 00:17:35,926
但是首先  我要先把你的椅子挪开  好吗
But first, I'm gonna roll you back away from the desk, okay?

366
00:17:35,927 --> 00:17:36,847
好的
Okay.

367
00:17:49,418 --> 00:17:50,348

现在
Now...

369
00:17:54,358 --> 00:17:57,288
我要非常小心地把你膝盖上的粉末弄掉
I'm gonna get that powder out of your lap very carefully.

370
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,158
真的吗  我们一点也不熟
Really? We hardly know each other.

371
00:17:59,438 --> 00:18:00,548
我会很温柔的
I'll be gentle.

372
00:18:01,719 --> 00:18:04,828
我需要你非常小心地站起来  慢点
I need you to stand very carefully, very slowly.

373
00:18:04,829 --> 00:18:06,179
-准备好了吗  -好了
- You ready? - Yeah.

374
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:09,189
起身
And... stand.

375
00:18:14,269 --> 00:18:16,259
很好  原地不动
Okay, good. Stay right here.

376
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:18,980
现在  我需要你
Now, I need you...

377
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,750
把手翻过来  把粉末倒进袋子
to turn your hand over, dump the powder in the bag.

378
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,510
你之前做过这个吗
You've done this before?

379
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,800
是的  一次
Yep. Once.

380
00:18:34,441 --> 00:18:37,700
好了  现在我需要你们俩站进这些袋子
Okay. Now I need you both to step into these bags,

381
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:40,180
脱掉衣服  把衣服留在袋子底部
remove your clothes, leave them in the bottom of the bag.

382
00:18:40,181 --> 00:18:42,231
-当着你的面吗  -我会转过身去
- In front of you? - I'll turn around.

383
00:18:44,901 --> 00:18:47,101
你们把这些穿上
I'll need you both to put these on.

384
00:18:54,922 --> 00:18:55,962
好了  德鲁
Done, Drew.

385
00:18:57,132 --> 00:18:58,142
好了
Okay.

386
00:18:58,192 --> 00:19:00,381
要是我们没事  我俩觉得该去大喝一场
If we survive this, we figured we should get drunk tonight.

387
00:19:00,382 --> 00:19:01,431
你想来吗
You want to join us?

388
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,593
我们还是先确保安全
Let's focus on surviving this first.

389
00:19:07,323 --> 00:19:08,393
失陪一下
Would you excuse me?

390
00:19:10,523 --> 00:19:12,693
你刚才居然就这么约他了
Did you really just ask him out?

391
00:19:13,063 --> 00:19:14,423
我知道  很怪异  对吗
I know. Weird, right?

392
00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:15,473
要是我要死了
If I'm gonna die...

393
00:19:25,274 --> 00:19:26,274
是苏打粉
Baking soda.

394
00:19:26,984 --> 00:19:27,894
什么
What?

395
00:19:29,534 --> 00:19:30,834
你不需要戴这个了
You do not need that.

396
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,074
我的老天爷
Oh... my God.

397
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:50,536
-就这样  -没错
- That's it? - Yup.

398
00:19:50,896 --> 00:19:52,106
我就不打扰了
I'll get out of your hair.

399
00:19:52,946 --> 00:19:55,756
通过一盒盒的苏打粉来拯救世界
Saving the world one box of baking soda at a time.

400
00:19:57,016 --> 00:19:57,976
保重
You take care.

401
00:19:58,146 --> 00:19:59,286
很高兴你们没死
I'm glad you didn't die.

402
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,616
那和我们一起去喝一杯吗
Hey, how about that drink?

403
00:20:03,776 --> 00:20:05,837
去庆祝
You know, that celebratory...

404
00:20:06,177 --> 00:20:07,787
"我们没死"的酒会
"We didn't die" drink.

405
00:20:07,887 --> 00:20:10,196
听起来很有趣  但我要加班
Sounds fun, but I got to work late.

406
00:20:10,197 --> 00:20:11,957
如果你改变心意
Well, if you change your mind...

407
00:20:12,407 --> 00:20:15,227
我们八点钟会在楼下的酒吧
we're gonna be in the downstairs bar at 8.

408
00:20:16,237 --> 00:20:17,207
知道了
Got it.

409
00:20:22,048 --> 00:20:23,528
你还真是主动
Wow, you are forward.

410
00:20:23,818 --> 00:20:24,847
"我破产了"
"I'm bankrupt.

411
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:25,167
证据

412
00:20:25,168 --> 00:20:26,607
老婆跑了
"I've lost my wife,

413
00:20:26,608 --> 00:20:28,058
孩子也没了
"I've lost my kids...

414
00:20:28,998 --> 00:20:30,278
全都因为你
"All because of you.

415
00:20:30,878 --> 00:20:33,938
你收了我很多钱  继续下个案子
"You overcharge me and go on to your next case.

416
00:20:34,298 --> 00:20:35,588
这次你别想得逞
"Well, not this time.

417
00:20:35,658 --> 00:20:37,488
你会像我一样受伤
"You're going to hurt just like me.

418
00:20:37,489 --> 00:20:38,709
这是蓖麻毒
"This is ricin.

419
00:20:38,969 --> 00:20:41,418
"就当做这是我的尾款"
Consider it in lieu of my last payment."

420
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:43,379
"当做"拼错了
"Lieu" is spelled L-O-O.

421
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:45,279
署名是"一位客户"
Signed "A Client."

422
00:20:46,349 --> 00:20:47,498
我们会查上面的指纹
We'll run fingerprints on this,

423
00:20:47,499 --> 00:20:49,039
但你们可以帮我做件事
but there's something you can do for me.

424
00:20:49,199 --> 00:20:50,089
什么事
What?

425
00:20:50,969 --> 00:20:52,490
我需要你们的客户名单
I need a list of your clients.

426
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,619
你知道我们不能那样做
You know we can't do that.

427
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,200
你也知道  嫌犯是你们的客户
Just so you know, the suspects are your clients,

428
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,759
或至少是洛哈特女士的客户
or at least Ms. Lockhart's clients,

429
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,019
不知道他们的身份我就帮不上忙
and I can't fully help you unless I know their identities.

430
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,940
伊恩
Ian...

431
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,699
我们的律师保密协议规定我们不能这样做
our attorney-client privilege prevents us from doing that.

432
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,100
而且理由很充分
And for really, really good reason.

433
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,861
我们的一些客户可能将来
Some of our clients might have future dealings

434
00:21:10,871 --> 00:21:12,021
会和你的部门产生纠纷
with your department.

435
00:21:12,051 --> 00:21:13,660
你们可以获取他们的同意
You can get permission from them.

436
00:21:13,661 --> 00:21:14,970
写这封信的客户
Any client who wrote that letter

437
00:21:14,971 --> 00:21:16,260
不会签同意书的
wouldn't agree to put their name on it.

438
00:21:16,261 --> 00:21:18,320
正好可以缩小嫌犯的范围
And that would narrow down our suspects.

439
00:21:18,321 --> 00:21:19,951
我们也不能把名字告诉你
Which we couldn't tell you.

440
00:21:20,121 --> 00:21:22,321
有人要杀了你们
Look, someone is trying to kill you.

441
00:21:23,431 --> 00:21:24,652
这可不是开玩笑
This is not a joke.

442
00:21:24,862 --> 00:21:26,642
我是来帮你们的  我不是你们的敌人
I'm here to help; I am not your enemy.

443
00:21:26,682 --> 00:21:30,232
但你们不配合我就帮不上忙
But I can't do anything unless you work with me.

444
00:21:30,672 --> 00:21:32,252
你也明白的
You know that's true.

445
00:21:33,242 --> 00:21:35,531
我们让警察调查客户的同时
We can't represent our clients at the same time

446
00:21:35,532 --> 00:21:37,481
我们就不能代表他们了
that we're having the police investigate them.

447
00:21:37,482 --> 00:21:39,273
非常合理
Yeah, everything makes sense.

448
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,552
我只知道你在司法部
Look, all I know is you were ten years

449
00:21:41,553 --> 00:21:42,602
工作了十年
at the Department of Justice,

450
00:21:42,603 --> 00:21:44,182
你一次也没让我操心过
and I didn't worry about you once,

451
00:21:44,183 --> 00:21:46,422
你才来这一个月  就发生了这样的事
and you've been here for a month, and here we are.

452
00:21:46,423 --> 00:21:47,993
现在是非常时期
It's an unusual time.

453
00:21:48,013 --> 00:21:49,703
不  我不这么认为
No, I don't think it is.

454
00:21:50,703 --> 00:21:52,033
我在做我想做的事
I'm doing what I want.

455
00:21:56,644 --> 00:21:58,234
-注意安全  -好
- Stay safe. - Okay.

456
00:22:01,014 --> 00:22:02,034
这下完了
This is fucked.

457
00:22:02,184 --> 00:22:04,454
确实  但他说得对
It is-- but he's right.

458
00:22:05,434 --> 00:22:07,613
我们不给他客户名单  他就帮不上忙
We can't give him the client names, he can't help us.

459
00:22:07,614 --> 00:22:08,833
虽然我是新来的
Look, I'm new here,

460
00:22:08,834 --> 00:22:11,404
但或许我们应该看看我们的收费标准
but maybe we should be looking at what we charge clients.

461
00:22:11,405 --> 00:22:12,464
我们的收费标准
What we charge clients

462
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:15,384
和市里所有律所相比都有竞争力  莉兹
is competitive with every other law firm in town, Liz.

463
00:22:15,385 --> 00:22:18,244
或许这就是客户对律师非常不满的原因
Which is maybe why clients are so angry with their lawyers.

464
00:22:18,245 --> 00:22:21,535
你真的要责怪我们吗  我们才是受害者
Are you really blaming us? We're the victims here.

465
00:22:21,755 --> 00:22:23,485
得了吧  我们离受害者还很远
Oh, come on, we are far from victims.

466
00:22:23,495 --> 00:22:25,505
为什么我们不
Why don't I do some research

467
00:22:25,685 --> 00:22:27,086
调查一下戴安的客户
into Diane's clients?

468
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:28,546
有多少来着
How many are there?

469
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:33,686
43名
Uh, 43.

470
00:22:34,126 --> 00:22:35,585
他们当中有没有不满意我们的收费
Any of them upset about our billing

471
00:22:35,586 --> 00:22:37,906
或是不满意输了官司之类的
or losing a case or whatever?

472
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:41,497
好吧
Yeah, right.

473
00:22:41,587 --> 00:22:43,006
我去警局那里把信取回来
Look, I'll get the letter back from the police

474
00:22:43,007 --> 00:22:45,216
再拿它和别的信对比一下
and compare it to other correspondences.

475
00:22:45,217 --> 00:22:47,057
昨天这儿来了个奇怪的人
There was somebody here yesterday.

476
00:22:47,147 --> 00:22:49,607
胡须男  送外卖的
A bearded man, delivering food.

477
00:22:49,697 --> 00:22:51,036
梅丽莎昨天和他说过话
Marissa talked to him.

478
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:52,377
我会及时向你更新情况
I'll keep you updated.

479
00:22:52,727 --> 00:22:54,397
现在我们要打电话给
Now, we need to get back on the phone

480
00:22:54,467 --> 00:22:55,847
安德莉亚・斯蒂文斯
with Andrea Stevens.

481
00:22:55,877 --> 00:22:57,868
我不想让他们觉得我们在示弱
We don't want to be seen as being weak here.

482
00:23:02,868 --> 00:23:03,808
你还好吗
You okay?

483
00:23:05,178 --> 00:23:06,158
还好
Oh, yeah.

484
00:23:06,548 --> 00:23:09,328
还想当糕点师吗
Yeah? Still want to become a pastry chef?

485
00:23:09,538 --> 00:23:11,238
真是越想越有吸引力了
It's looking more and more appealing.

486
00:23:11,798 --> 00:23:13,079
有什么我能帮你的吗
Is there anything I can do?

487
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:16,219
不用了  我就是...需要摆脱这件事
No, I just... I just have to shake this off.

488
00:23:16,939 --> 00:23:18,139
为什么不回家休息
Why don't you go home?

489
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:19,949
下午休息吧
Take the afternoon.

490
00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:22,088
你刚经历了疑似蓖麻毒的袭击
If there's ever a day you could take a break,

491
00:23:22,089 --> 00:23:23,889
实在是放假的最佳理由了
it's after a ricin scare.

492
00:23:26,069 --> 00:23:28,539
待会吧  我没事  我还要采集证词
I mean, maybe later. I'm good. I have the depo.

493
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,430
我帮你做
I'll handle it.

494
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,520
去吧
Go.

495
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,619
他真的只是来送餐
He really was just delivering food.

496
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,020
今天的事和他没关系
He had nothing to do with this.

497
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,790
戴安有点多疑了
Diane's getting a little paranoid.

498
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,960
也是有原因的  你看起来不错啊
With good reason. You seem good.

499
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,510
是啊  这类事件我应付自如
Yeah. I tend to rise to these occasions.

500
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:43,750
你有没有问收发室
Are you questioning the mail room?

501
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,541
这就去
Next stop.

502
00:23:44,601 --> 00:23:45,321
我帮你
Can I help?

503
00:23:45,331 --> 00:23:47,381
不用了  你去继续盯真人秀镜头吧
No. You take the reality show footage.

504
00:23:48,001 --> 00:23:48,941
我这就去
I'm on it.

505
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,211
屋里站满了警察
I had wall-to-wall cops in here.

506
00:23:52,361 --> 00:23:53,950
他们把我的整个系统都打乱了
They messed up my whole system.

507
00:23:53,951 --> 00:23:57,271
我又要花三四个小时才能赶回原来的进度
It's gonna take me three, four hours just to get caught up.

508
00:23:58,921 --> 00:23:59,892
这是什么
What's this?

509
00:24:00,312 --> 00:24:01,902
恐吓信封是从这里送出的
The threatening envelope came inside.

510
00:24:01,932 --> 00:24:03,041
应该是由人亲手交送到这儿
Looks like it was hand-delivered here,

511
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:05,942
然后你的人把信送进了戴安的办公室
then one of your guys brought it up to Diane's office.

512
00:24:07,682 --> 00:24:08,912
不会是我的人
Wasn't one of my guys.

513
00:24:09,822 --> 00:24:11,312
不是所有信都先送到收发室吗
Doesn't everything go through the mail room?

514
00:24:11,342 --> 00:24:12,872
从外面送来的信是
Everything from the outside.

515
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:15,503
这封信既没有署名  也没有时间戳
This doesn't have a signature, no time stamp.

516
00:24:15,813 --> 00:24:17,953
信是从这栋楼里送出的
This came from inside the building.

517
00:24:20,733 --> 00:24:22,212
我的天啊
Oh, my gosh,

518
00:24:22,213 --> 00:24:23,832
太遗憾了
I am so sorry.

519
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:24,983
我听说了
I heard.

520
00:24:25,223 --> 00:24:26,892
-听说什么了  -听说你们遇到麻烦了
- About? - About your troubles here.

521
00:24:26,893 --> 00:24:28,983
看起来你们树敌了  是吧
I mean, it seems like you have some enemies, huh?

522
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:32,163
如果能帮你的话  我们就别打这场官司了
If it helps, we could take this case off your plate,

523
00:24:32,164 --> 00:24:33,564
只要达成协议就好
come to some sort of settlement.

524
00:24:33,924 --> 00:24:34,844
好啊
Sure.

525
00:24:35,664 --> 00:24:37,034
430万
$4.3 million.

526
00:24:37,224 --> 00:24:38,443
不是我想的那个数字
Mm, not quite what I had in mind.

527
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:40,963
但是  等等  九万五千倒是可以
But 95... no, $95,000 would do it.

528
00:24:40,964 --> 00:24:42,183
你们不会想
Listen, you don't want to have

529
00:24:42,184 --> 00:24:44,684
再多一个对你们不满的客户吧
another unhappy client on your hands, do you?

530
00:24:45,134 --> 00:24:46,114
我们开始吧
Shall we?

531
00:24:52,295 --> 00:24:53,175
莉兹
Liz.

532
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:55,345
你来干什么
What are you doing?

533
00:24:56,055 --> 00:24:58,475
戴安让我来  她觉得她有点应付不来
Oh. Diane asked me to sit in. She's not feeling up to it.

534
00:25:00,525 --> 00:25:01,425
好吧
Yeah.

535
00:25:04,046 --> 00:25:06,645
你口渴吗  要我拿点东西给你喝吗
Are you thirsty? Can I get you something to drink,

536
00:25:06,646 --> 00:25:07,335
好啊
Yeah.

537
00:25:07,336 --> 00:25:10,776
-或者不喝东西了  你懂吗  -不是很懂
- maybe, or... or maybe not, you know? - I really don't know.

538
00:25:13,146 --> 00:25:14,436
这段视频是在哪拍的
 Where was this video taken?

539
00:25:14,776 --> 00:25:16,246
这是顶层公寓的吧台
It was at the bar at the penthouse.

540
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:18,086
他们相处得挺融洽的  是吧
They look pretty comfortable with each other, don't they?

541
00:25:18,087 --> 00:25:20,116
你这是针对梅兰妮心理状态的推测
That is speculation about Melanie's state of mind,

542
00:25:20,117 --> 00:25:21,796
而且距离侵犯发生还有好几个小时
hours before the assault took place.

543
00:25:21,797 --> 00:25:22,946
涉嫌侵犯
Alleged assault.

544
00:25:22,947 --> 00:25:24,846
你知道现在法官不在席吧
And you know there's no judge here, right?

545
00:25:24,847 --> 00:25:26,716
我只是将我的反对记录在案
I'm just preserving the objection for the record.

546
00:25:26,717 --> 00:25:28,287
当然  请记下来
Of course. Preserved.

547
00:25:29,047 --> 00:25:31,256
在这场三点发生的邂逅后和下一场开始前
Did you speak with Melanie after this 3:00 encounter,

548
00:25:31,257 --> 00:25:32,346
你有没有和梅兰妮说过话
but before the later one?

549
00:25:32,347 --> 00:25:33,897
我做了一个OTF
I conducted an OTF.

550
00:25:33,898 --> 00:25:34,677
解释一下
And what is that?

551
00:25:34,678 --> 00:25:36,788
就是"即兴速访"
That's an "On the fly" interview.

552
00:25:37,988 --> 00:25:39,457
我和布雷克玩得很开心
I had a great time with Blake.

553
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:43,287
我感觉你和布雷克之间有化学反应
Yeah, I'm sensing that you and Blake have good chemistry.

554
00:25:43,288 --> 00:25:45,217
你可以说我们相处得很好
Yeah, you could say we're getting along.

555
00:25:45,218 --> 00:25:47,507
抱歉  打断一下  请说他的名字
Sorry, sorry. Uh, use his name, please.

556
00:25:47,508 --> 00:25:48,438
该死
Shit.

557
00:25:49,789 --> 00:25:51,949
我和布雷克之间有化学反应
Blake and I have great chemistry.

558
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:54,979
他看起来也很开心
He seems down to have a good time.

559
00:25:55,089 --> 00:25:59,859
他绝对是那个让我想认真相处的人
Definitely someone to spend some quality time with.

560
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:02,718
所以  你像摆弄木偶一样摆弄我们的客户
So, you're turning our client into a puppet,

561
00:26:02,719 --> 00:26:04,059
然后还怪她
and then you blame her?

562
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,880
我的天
Oh, my God.

563
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:08,120
-怎么了  -我从视频里找到了有用的东西
- What's wrong? - I found something in the video.

564
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,909
我要饿死了  我们待会再谈不行吗
I'm starving. Can we talk about this later?

565
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,459
我都不知道你到底要我怎样
I don't even get what you're asking me.

566
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,489
我觉得你非常清楚我在说什么
Oh, I think you know exactly what I'm saying.

567
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:19,589
梅兰妮  你确实说了该说的
I mean, Melanie, you talk the talk,

568
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,800
-但我不知道  -我不懂你的意思
- but I don't know. - I don't understand.

569
00:26:21,801 --> 00:26:23,660
亲爱的  你的话语片段确实不错
You give a good sound bite, honey,

570
00:26:23,661 --> 00:26:25,540
但是电视节目是视觉媒体
but TV is a visual medium.

571
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:27,641
我需要有影像来支撑
I need the video to back that up.

572
00:26:28,111 --> 00:26:30,121
你不觉得这已经很有看点了吗
You don't think that this is visual?

573
00:26:30,341 --> 00:26:32,891
你的上衣就是问题的所在之处
Now, that top sums up the problem.

574
00:26:33,421 --> 00:26:35,962
你是个相机挑逗者  梅兰妮
You are a camera tease, Melanie.

575
00:26:36,342 --> 00:26:38,112
梅兰妮  你还想继续拍吗
Melanie, you want to stay on the show?

576
00:26:38,672 --> 00:26:40,232
那你得秀出点东西来
Then you gotta show us something.

577
00:26:41,972 --> 00:26:42,922
你这话什么意思
What did you mean by that?

578
00:26:43,912 --> 00:26:45,572
我的意思就是
I just meant that, uh...

579
00:26:46,072 --> 00:26:49,022
她话说得很满  但是
You know, she was talking a very big game, but, uh,

580
00:26:49,412 --> 00:26:51,613
在现实中  她并不够
in reality, she-- she wasn't exactly...

581
00:26:52,133 --> 00:26:53,663
-风骚吗  -容我打断一下
- Putting out? - Excuse me,

582
00:26:54,283 --> 00:26:55,333
她是谁
who is that?

583
00:26:56,153 --> 00:26:57,623
我们的调查员
One of our investigators.

584
00:26:58,863 --> 00:27:00,852
能不能请她不要质问我的客户
Could you ask her not to question my client, please?

585
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:02,072
当然  只要你的客户
Sure. As soon as your client

586
00:27:02,073 --> 00:27:03,162
好好回答问题
starts answering the questions.

587
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,813
大家都知道
Look, everybody knows that

588
00:27:05,053 --> 00:27:07,574
我们节目的收视率不稳定
our show's ratings go up or down

589
00:27:08,404 --> 00:27:10,323
都取决于有没有挑逗性内容
based on us being provocative.

590
00:27:10,324 --> 00:27:12,753
这并不意味着我们容忍强奸
That does not mean that we condone rape.

591
00:27:12,754 --> 00:27:13,483
用词很重啊
Strong words.

592
00:27:13,484 --> 00:27:15,544
抱歉打断一下  我确实很疑惑
I'm sorry, I'm really confused here.

593
00:27:16,324 --> 00:27:17,543
我以为你们的论点是
I thought your whole argument

594
00:27:17,544 --> 00:27:19,143
你们的客户失去意识
was that she was unconscious.

595
00:27:19,144 --> 00:27:21,003
现在你们开始争辩是我们强迫她脱衣
Now you're arguing that we forced her to strip

596
00:27:21,004 --> 00:27:25,085
并接受口交  我很困惑
and receive oral sex. I'm just... confused.

597
00:27:25,145 --> 00:27:28,344
求你了  我饿死了  给我个三明治也行
Please, I'm starving. Can I even get a sandwich?

598
00:27:28,345 --> 00:27:29,624
总结场完了之后就可以吃
Yes, after the Wrap-Up.

599
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:32,405
看  他们已经摆好龙舌兰自助宴了
But look, they just put out the tequila buffet.

600
00:27:32,535 --> 00:27:34,915
龙舌兰自助宴  是什么
So, what is-- what is the tequila buffet?

601
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:36,324
我们所有的
Well, all our--

602
00:27:36,325 --> 00:27:38,205
所有的参与者都知道我们有这个自助宴
all our contestants know that we had that.

603
00:27:38,206 --> 00:27:40,295
我知道  但这到底是什么  我就是好奇
Yeah, but what-- what is it? I'm just curious.

604
00:27:40,296 --> 00:27:43,965
就是摆了十几种高档龙舌兰酒的自助宴
It's a-about a dozen different high-end tequilas,

605
00:27:43,966 --> 00:27:45,335
为了作比较用
for comparison's sake.

606
00:27:45,336 --> 00:27:47,985
但他们都六小时没吃饭
And no food for six hours?

607
00:27:47,986 --> 00:27:49,836
就只喝龙舌兰
Just shots of tequila?

608
00:27:49,866 --> 00:27:51,055
我们没做错什么
Look, we haven't done anything wrong.

609
00:27:51,056 --> 00:27:52,175
这是节目的传统
This is show tradition.

610
00:27:52,176 --> 00:27:53,426
对啊  我们也没强迫
Yes, and we're not forcing

611
00:27:53,427 --> 00:27:55,226
参与者喝  所以就这样吧
the contestants to drink, so please.

612
00:27:55,227 --> 00:27:56,827
这环节是第15季的一部分吗
Is it part of season 15?

613
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,267
抱歉  你说什么
I'm sorry, what?

614
00:28:00,567 --> 00:28:01,847
如果你没做错什么
If you did nothing wrong,

615
00:28:01,857 --> 00:28:04,607
那么龙舌兰自助宴是第15季的一部分吗
is the tequila buffet part of season 15?

616
00:28:07,077 --> 00:28:07,957
不是
No.

617
00:28:09,238 --> 00:28:10,218
谢谢
Thank you.

618
00:28:22,908 --> 00:28:23,698

- Do you have one second? - Sure.

621
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,808
你有没有客户在我们这栋楼里工作
Do any of your clients have offices inside the building?

622
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,539
我们这栋楼吗  为什么这么问
Our building? Why?

623
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:35,788
我问了收发室的人  但是这封信
I spoke to the mail room, but the letter sent to you

624
00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:37,369
是从这栋楼里寄来的
came from inside the building.

625
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,430
好吧  有
Well, there's, um...

626
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,840
有个房地产公司  我们给他们做税务工作
a real estate firm-- we did taxes with them.

627
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:51,250
还有  一个科技创业公司
And, um, yeah, a tech start-up.

628
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:54,299
他们的执行总裁叫艾力克・克莱顿
The, uh, CEO, Alec Crichton.

629
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,851
他的离婚案是我们经手的
We handled his divorce.

630
00:28:55,881 --> 00:28:57,781
好
Okay, good.

631
00:28:57,931 --> 00:28:59,591
跟他俩有过争执吗
Any issues with either of them?

632
00:28:59,751 --> 00:29:01,341
没  记忆中没有过
No, not that I remember.

633
00:29:02,161 --> 00:29:04,771
离婚案后来的气氛不太好
The divorce, of course, got heated.

634
00:29:04,891 --> 00:29:06,471
他失去了孩子的抚养权吗
Well, he lose custody of his kids?

635
00:29:07,271 --> 00:29:07,991
是的
Yes.

636
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:10,191
好
Okay.

637
00:29:10,491 --> 00:29:13,702
我会去问问  如果你想起什么记得说
I'll question them. If anything occurs to you, call me.

638
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:16,072
好  再见
Um, yeah. Good-bye.

639
00:29:22,872 --> 00:29:23,682
行吧
All right.

640
00:29:45,844 --> 00:29:46,493
分担花费政府补贴为奥巴马医保中的条款

641
00:29:46,494 --> 00:29:49,113
在政府停止发放分担花费补贴后
President Trump has defended his decision

642
00:29:49,114 --> 00:29:51,423
特朗普总统为该决议辩护
to end cost-sharing reduction subsidies

643
00:29:51,424 --> 00:29:53,594
声明股价的涨...
by pointing to stock price gains...

644
00:29:53,714 --> 00:29:53,813
执行制作人  埃尔维斯・哈利德

645
00:29:53,814 --> 00:29:56,413
前传的想法
The idea of a... A prequel

646
00:29:56,414 --> 00:29:58,174
直到我找到另一种切入的方式
just didn't interest me,

647
00:29:58,175 --> 00:30:00,825
才激起我的兴趣
until I found another way in.

648
00:30:03,055 --> 00:30:04,775
只要你是警探  就可以为所欲为
When you're a detective, you can do anything.

649
00:30:05,285 --> 00:30:08,025
奸淫掳掠  为所欲为
Grab 'em by the pussy. Anything.

650
00:30:08,245 --> 00:30:09,144
很多人以为这是在说特朗普
And a lot of people think it's about Trump.

651
00:30:09,145 --> 00:30:10,164
《骄阳前的黑暗》
执行制作人  埃尔维斯・哈利德

652
00:30:10,165 --> 00:30:12,755
但其实是说某种心理状态
But it's really about a certain mindset.

653
00:30:14,026 --> 00:30:16,606
纽约臭气熏天  我要做大清洗
New York's a swamp, and I'm cleaning it up.

654
00:30:23,626 --> 00:30:27,115
#与魔鬼同行#
#With the devil I ride#

655
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:29,637
#与魔鬼同行#
#With the devil I ride...#

656
00:30:29,647 --> 00:30:31,036
这将是将军肚小猪
This will be the third week

657
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:33,216
住在地图室的第三周了
the potbellied pig occupies the Map Room.

658
00:30:33,217 --> 00:30:33,546
将军肚小猪进驻白宫地图室

659
00:30:33,547 --> 00:30:35,686
虽然总统坚称皮蒂小猪
Though the president insists Petey the Pig

660
00:30:35,687 --> 00:30:38,006
是有益的消遣  许多评论员担心
is a welcome distraction, many critics worry

661
00:30:38,007 --> 00:30:40,826
小猪有损白宫声誉
the animal debases the office of the presidency.

662
00:30:40,827 --> 00:30:41,846
我们想听听您的意见
We want to hear from you.

663
00:30:41,847 --> 00:30:44,547
总统是否应该在白宫地图室收养小猪
Should the president keep a pig in the White House Map Room?

664
00:30:44,557 --> 00:30:45,608
上网...
Go online...

665
00:30:54,528 --> 00:30:57,028
我喜欢她  她只是直话直说
Uh, I like her. She just says what she thinks.

666
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:59,418
我知道  但你信任她吗
Eh, I know. But do you trust her?

667
00:30:59,758 --> 00:31:01,109
我不知道  这重要吗
Uh, I don't know. Does that matter?

668
00:31:01,429 --> 00:31:02,439
我又不娶她
I'm not gonna marry her.

669
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:05,438
老天爷  你能想象他俩的婚姻吗
My God, can you imagine that marriage?

670
00:31:05,439 --> 00:31:06,559
莉兹和博斯曼
Liz and Boseman?

671
00:31:11,489 --> 00:31:12,758
他们到底看上对方哪一点了
What did they even see in each other?

672
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:13,709
谁知道
I don't know.

673
00:31:13,859 --> 00:31:15,099
也许是喜欢危险属性
Probably danger.

674
00:31:15,649 --> 00:31:17,700
今天他称我为他的调查员
He called me one of his investigators today.

675
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,400
谁  博斯曼吗
Who, Boseman? Mm-hmm.

676
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,120
或者像我这样直呼其名  阿德里安
Or as I call him, Adrian.

677
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,090
-棒  -感觉他和我的关系更近了
- Nice. - I think we're getting closer, he and I.

678
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,269
我是说  他现在记得我的名字了
And by that, I mean he knows my name now.

679
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,450
干杯
I will drink to that.

680
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:33,000
咱俩心情这么好真奇怪
It's odd that we're in such a good mood,

681
00:31:33,001 --> 00:31:35,201
考虑到今天差点没命
given that we were almost killed today.

682
00:31:35,231 --> 00:31:37,631
我们是活在危险中的一代
Well, we're the generation of living dangerously.

683
00:31:38,901 --> 00:31:39,681
你们还在这儿
You're still here!

684
00:31:39,851 --> 00:31:41,251
-德鲁  -德鲁
- Drew! - Drew!

685
00:31:42,991 --> 00:31:44,600
天啊  你俩喝醉了
God, you guys are sloshed.

686
00:31:44,601 --> 00:31:45,760
没  没有
No! No.

687
00:31:45,761 --> 00:31:47,662
我们只是见到你太高兴了
We are just really happy to see you.

688
00:31:47,692 --> 00:31:49,291
-见我还活着  -没错
- Alive? - Yes!

689
00:31:49,292 --> 00:31:50,532
-没错  -没错
- Yes! - Yes!

690
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:52,391
来坐
Here, sit, sit.

691
00:31:52,392 --> 00:31:54,372
高脚凳
These are tall chairs.

692
00:31:55,102 --> 00:31:56,321
你俩在喝什么
Uh, what are you drinking?

693
00:31:56,322 --> 00:31:58,602
-酸威士忌  -不只一杯
- Whiskey sours. - More than one sour.

694
00:31:58,682 --> 00:32:00,682
绝不是一杯
Not a singular sour.

695
00:32:01,342 --> 00:32:02,072
好
Okay.

696
00:32:03,033 --> 00:32:04,273
-再来一杯  -好的
- One more? - All right.

697
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:07,943
话说...
So...

698
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:11,503
糟糕
Oh, shit.

699
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,683
怎么了
What?

700
00:32:13,513 --> 00:32:16,403
我要你跟我去趟洗手间
I need you to come with me to the bathroom.

701
00:32:16,673 --> 00:32:17,463
现在吗
Now?

702
00:32:17,923 --> 00:32:18,904
是的
Yes.

703
00:32:19,544 --> 00:32:20,454
别走开
Don't leave.

704
00:32:24,404 --> 00:32:25,874
-怎么了  -过来
- Why? Why? - Come here.

705
00:32:27,524 --> 00:32:30,064
锁不上  这样靠着门吧
Oh, there's no lock. Here, just lean against the door.

706
00:32:31,594 --> 00:32:32,614
他是为你来的
He's here for you.

707
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,775
-什么  -他是来看你的
- What? - He's here to see you.

708
00:32:35,295 --> 00:32:37,764
-不是  -真的  是你请他来的
- No! - Yes. You invited him tonight.

709
00:32:37,765 --> 00:32:40,415
-没错  但是...  -等等  去你的
- Yeah, but for... - Wait! Fuck you!

710
00:32:40,885 --> 00:32:43,364
我是为你请的  我对他又没兴趣
I invited him for you. I'm not interested in him.

711
00:32:43,365 --> 00:32:45,145
我知道  但他并不知道
Yeah, I know. But he doesn't know that.

712
00:32:46,105 --> 00:32:48,234
好吧  要我回家吗
Okay, well, uh, do I go home?

713
00:32:48,235 --> 00:32:50,756
不  我不想你走  我们正玩得开心
No. No, I don't want you to. We're having fun.

714
00:32:51,086 --> 00:32:52,086
那我怎么做
Then what do I do?

715
00:32:53,016 --> 00:32:54,206
暗示一下你是同性恋
Hint that you're gay.

716
00:32:54,356 --> 00:32:55,625
什么
What?

717
00:32:55,626 --> 00:32:57,315
-怎么暗示  -不知道
- How do I do that? - I don't know.

718
00:32:57,316 --> 00:32:59,325
-天啊  我要回去喝酒了  -别走
- Oh, my God. I am going back to the bar. - No!

719
00:32:59,326 --> 00:33:01,116
-让开  -玛娅
- Out of the way. - Maia!

720
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:02,726
等等
Wait!

721
00:33:07,247 --> 00:33:10,987
-嗨  -我又点了两杯
- Hi. - Hey. I ordered you two more.

722
00:33:11,087 --> 00:33:12,117
每人两杯吗
Two more each?

723
00:33:12,127 --> 00:33:15,037
不  那样的话太不负责任了
No. That would be irresponsible.

724
00:33:16,197 --> 00:33:17,067
我是同性恋
I'm gay.

725
00:33:21,388 --> 00:33:22,538
我该...
What should I...

726
00:33:23,188 --> 00:33:24,598
说什么
say? Uh...

727
00:33:25,528 --> 00:33:27,137
恭喜
Congratulations.

728
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:29,527
我们不是一对
We're not gay. Not the two of us.

729
00:33:29,528 --> 00:33:30,468
只有我是同性恋
I'm just gay.

730
00:33:35,078 --> 00:33:36,629
你真的好帅
You're really handsome.

731
00:33:37,139 --> 00:33:40,748
天啊  行了  我要回家了
Oh, my... Okay, i'm gonna go home.

732
00:33:40,749 --> 00:33:42,018
别走  留下来
No, no, stay.

733
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:43,799
咱们都别走
We should all stay. Hey.

734
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:45,399
你们要来点猛的吗
You guys want something harder?

735
00:33:47,849 --> 00:33:50,078
没错  我受冒犯了  我没强奸她
Yes, I'm offended! I didn't rape her.

736
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:51,909
-你怎么不说实话  梅兰妮  -麻烦你
- Why don't you tell the truth, Melanie? - Please,

737
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:53,699
克制住不要与我当事人对话
refrain from addressing my client.

738
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,399
你可以请你当事人出去避嫌
You could always ask your client to step out.

739
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,710
我要在现场
I want to be here for this.

740
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,409
布雷克  你为什么离开
Okay. Blake, why did you leave season 14

741
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:00,990
《欲动风城》第14季
of Chicago Penthouse?

742
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,499
因为她说我侵犯了她
Because she said I assaulted her,

743
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,899
制作人就淘汰我出局了
and then the producers kicked me off.

744
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,220
你与克拉克女士有过性接触吗
Did you have any sexual contact with Ms. Clark?

745
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:09,720
有过  但她是乐意的  我发誓
Yes, but she was into it. I swear to God,

746
00:34:09,721 --> 00:34:11,700
我不是那种会硬取的人
I am not the kind of guy who does something like that.

747
00:34:11,701 --> 00:34:14,450
所以性交是双方认可的
So the sexual contact was consensual?

748
00:34:14,451 --> 00:34:17,410
是  梅兰妮问我要不要打一炮
Yeah. Melanie asked me if I wanted a surefire way

749
00:34:17,411 --> 00:34:19,911
确保晋级最终一轮  我说当然好
to make it to the final round. I said sure.

750
00:34:20,221 --> 00:34:22,250
我又不傻  我很努力在做节目
I mean, I'm not stupid. I'm trying to up my brand.

751
00:34:22,251 --> 00:34:24,482
-性交是她的主意  -百分百她的主意
- The sex was her idea? - 100%.

752
00:34:24,602 --> 00:34:25,901
她知道如何高调做戏
She knew how to make a spectacle,

753
00:34:25,902 --> 00:34:27,772
那样的话就意味着更多的节目时间
and she knew that would mean more camera time.

754
00:34:28,312 --> 00:34:29,852
你知道让我生气的是什么吗
You know what pisses me off?

755
00:34:29,932 --> 00:34:31,161
我没有指控你  布雷克
I'm not accusing you, Blake.

756
00:34:31,162 --> 00:34:32,462
我没有做错什么
I did not do anything wrong.

757
00:34:32,802 --> 00:34:34,121
是你对我紧追不舍  梅兰妮
You were all over me, Melanie.

758
00:34:34,122 --> 00:34:35,282
是你拉我进热浴缸的
You pulled me into that hot tub.

759
00:34:35,292 --> 00:34:36,521
是醉酒后发生的
It was a drunken hookup.

760
00:34:36,522 --> 00:34:37,931
而我对此毫无记忆
And I have zero memory of that.

761
00:34:37,932 --> 00:34:40,662
-我记得  -这才是重点
- Well, I do. - That's the whole point.

762
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:42,543
行了  够了
Okay, okay, okay. Enough.

763
00:34:42,763 --> 00:34:44,283
没事  听着...
No, it's all right. Look...

764
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,183
你没有把我灌醉
You didn't get me drunk.

765
00:34:47,423 --> 00:34:48,773
你没有给我下药
You didn't drug me.

766
00:34:48,963 --> 00:34:51,773
你没有把我按住  强取强攻
You didn't hold me down and force yourself on me.

767
00:34:51,893 --> 00:34:53,003
我也没有拒绝你
And I didn't say no.

768
00:34:53,593 --> 00:34:57,064
但某一时刻  我失去了拒绝的能力
But at some point, I lost the ability to say no.

769
00:34:57,544 --> 00:34:59,553
你的问题是
And your problem is you're so sure

770
00:34:59,554 --> 00:35:02,523
你确信自己不是那种男人  但却没意识到
you're not one of those guys that you fail to realize that,

771
00:35:02,524 --> 00:35:04,764
在那天  那个时刻
on that day, in that moment,

772
00:35:04,884 --> 00:35:07,664
你完成了那件你认为是我挑起的事
you decided to finish what you thought I had started.

773
00:35:07,934 --> 00:35:09,914
你就成为了那种男人  布雷克
You became one of those guys, Blake.

774
00:35:16,455 --> 00:35:18,105
是  我听说了
Yeah, I heard about that.

775
00:35:18,175 --> 00:35:20,255
老天爷  炭疽
Jesus. Anthrax.

776
00:35:20,555 --> 00:35:22,015
你们都还好吧
You guys all right up there?

777
00:35:22,195 --> 00:35:23,795
没事  说是蓖麻毒
Yeah. Ricin.

778
00:35:24,015 --> 00:35:24,935
只是吓唬人的
Just a scare.

779
00:35:25,445 --> 00:35:27,385
我知道你是戴安的客户
I understand you're one of Diane's clients.

780
00:35:27,386 --> 00:35:28,295
对啊
Oh, yeah.

781
00:35:28,296 --> 00:35:29,876
那个愚蠢的贱人
That stupid bitch.

782
00:35:30,186 --> 00:35:31,346
什么
Excuse me?

783
00:35:31,416 --> 00:35:32,745
不  我不是说戴安
No, not Diane.

784
00:35:32,746 --> 00:35:34,216
她是个好人
She's a sweetheart.

785
00:35:34,346 --> 00:35:36,005
我是指我的前妻
No, my ex-wife.

786
00:35:36,006 --> 00:35:38,016
就是因为她  我才需要戴安的
She's the reason I needed Diane.

787
00:35:41,587 --> 00:35:42,707
帅
Cool.

788
00:35:44,527 --> 00:35:45,447
这是什么
What is it?

789
00:35:45,487 --> 00:35:48,187
我还不怎么清楚
Oh. I don't know yet, you know?

790
00:35:48,197 --> 00:35:50,807
还在试着...理清思路
It's still trying to... become something.

791
00:35:50,897 --> 00:35:53,087
我得先写下来才知道自己在想什么
I don't know what I'm thinking until I write it down.

792
00:35:53,867 --> 00:35:54,766
都是你写的吗
This is all your writing?

793
00:35:54,767 --> 00:35:57,718
对  看着像连环杀手对吧
Yeah. Looks like a serial killer, doesn't it?

794
00:36:02,078 --> 00:36:03,178
没错
Yep.

795
00:36:13,069 --> 00:36:14,209
洛莉・阿克曼
Lori Akerman.

796
00:36:14,229 --> 00:36:17,039
我以前是《欲动风城》的制片人
I was a production manager on Chicago Penthouse.

797
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:18,938
以前吗  你为什么会被解雇
You were? And why were you fired?

798
00:36:18,939 --> 00:36:20,018
因为我看见了我认为是
Because I saw what I thought

799
00:36:20,019 --> 00:36:21,568
未经双方一致同意的性行为
was nonconsensual sex,

800
00:36:21,569 --> 00:36:23,128
然后我停止了拍摄
and I shut down the production.

801
00:36:23,129 --> 00:36:25,959
这个解雇理由挺奇怪的
That seems like a strange reason to fire you.

802
00:36:26,279 --> 00:36:27,848
史蒂文斯女士说得像是
Ms. Stevens makes it sound like

803
00:36:27,849 --> 00:36:29,599
节目只是尽职尽责
the show was just being responsible.

804
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,449
但我现在失业了
And yet here I am, out of work.

805
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:33,570
我觉得其中有误解
I think there's a misunderstanding here.

806
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,019
你被解雇不是因为
You were not let go because you...

807
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,939
史蒂文斯女士  别这样
Ms. Stevens, please.

808
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,939
你看见了什么让你担忧的事
What did you see that concerned you?

809
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,569
梅兰妮当时的精神状态
Melanie was in no state of mind

810
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:43,439
根本无法做出任何决定
to be making any kind of decisions,

811
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,880
更别说发生性行为的决定了
much less sexual ones.

812
00:36:44,881 --> 00:36:46,020
她几乎是神志不清的
She was barely conscious.

813
00:36:46,021 --> 00:36:47,800
那你当时为什么不阻止呢
And why didn't you stop it at the time?

814
00:36:47,801 --> 00:36:50,551
我在和另一些参赛选手做采访
I was doing interviews with other cast members.

815
00:36:50,601 --> 00:36:52,961
我知道梅兰妮喝醉了  但是我以为
I knew Melanie was drunk, but I thought

816
00:36:52,971 --> 00:36:54,900
她和布雷克那时候已经被分开了
that she and Blake had separated by then.

817
00:36:54,901 --> 00:36:56,021
没有其他问题了
No further questions.

818
00:36:56,031 --> 00:36:57,611
阿克曼女士
Ms. Akerman, uh,

819
00:36:57,821 --> 00:37:00,922
首先我对你现在的无业状态表示遗憾
first of all, I am so sorry about your unemployed state.

820
00:37:01,242 --> 00:37:02,092
谢谢
Thank you.

821
00:37:02,162 --> 00:37:03,261
你以前有过多少次
How many prior production

822
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:04,952
节目暂停拍摄的经历呢
shutdowns have you been involved in?

823
00:37:05,562 --> 00:37:06,511
这是第一次
This was my first.

824
00:37:06,512 --> 00:37:08,701
在《欲动风城》之前
And prior to, uh, Chicago Penthouse,

825
00:37:08,702 --> 00:37:10,881
你在《德通纳海滩》
you worked on Daytona Beach

826
00:37:10,882 --> 00:37:13,231
和《月夜宿舍》工作过
and Dorm Room Afterdark?

827
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:15,902
-对  -所以《欲动风城》发生了什么
- Yes. - So, what happened on Chicago Penthouse

828
00:37:15,903 --> 00:37:17,783
比其他节目更糟糕的事情呢
that was worse than those other shows?

829
00:37:17,873 --> 00:37:19,073
我说过了
I already said.

830
00:37:19,143 --> 00:37:20,602
不是双方同意的性行为
Non-consensual sex.

831
00:37:20,603 --> 00:37:21,493
我明白了
I see.

832
00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:25,352
你对布雷克・马斯特占了节目的
And how did you feel about Blake Masters taking

833
00:37:25,353 --> 00:37:27,083
主角戏份有什么感受
a prominent role on the show?

834
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:30,072
我
I...

835
00:37:30,073 --> 00:37:31,374
-我有什么感受  -对
- How did I feel? - Yes.

836
00:37:31,384 --> 00:37:33,264
你不是觉得他不是合适的选角吗
Didn't you disapprove of his casting?

837
00:37:34,164 --> 00:37:34,853
没错
No.

838
00:37:34,854 --> 00:37:37,303
节目里没有非裔女性选手
There were no African-American female contestants on the show.

839
00:37:37,304 --> 00:37:38,294
对吗
Is that correct?

840
00:37:38,734 --> 00:37:40,613
我不参与选角
I am not involved in casting.

841
00:37:40,614 --> 00:37:42,793
你不担心节目里会有
You weren't concerned about depicting

842
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:45,604
-太多跨种族恋爱关系吗  -不
- too many interracial relationships? - No.

843
00:37:46,535 --> 00:37:48,914
这里是几位《欲动风城》的
Here are some affidavits from several producers

844
00:37:48,915 --> 00:37:50,745
制作人的宣誓书
on Chicago Penthouse

845
00:37:50,765 --> 00:37:52,674
里面指出你明确表达过
attesting that you were expressly concerned

846
00:37:52,675 --> 00:37:53,935
对跨种族恋爱
about the prevalence

847
00:37:54,025 --> 00:37:55,474
盛行的担忧
of interracial relationships.

848
00:37:55,475 --> 00:37:57,074
-反对  -真的吗  为什么
- Objection. - Really? Why?

849
00:37:57,075 --> 00:37:59,035
-和本案无关  -事实上我猜
- Relevance. - Actually, my guess is

850
00:37:59,045 --> 00:38:01,015
你是害怕这个问题太有关了
you're worried this is very relevant.

851
00:38:01,025 --> 00:38:02,856
你是把我的话断章取义
You're taking me out of context.

852
00:38:03,016 --> 00:38:05,176
我是在说观众的看法
I was talking about audience perception.

853
00:38:05,586 --> 00:38:07,355
-我不种族歧视  -女士  你停止拍摄
- I'm not a racist. - Ma'am, didn't you shut down

854
00:38:07,356 --> 00:38:08,895
是因为布雷克是黑人
the show because Blake was black

855
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,085
而梅兰妮是白人对吗
and Melanie was white?

856
00:38:10,086 --> 00:38:12,115
-不是  -所以你允许白人选手之间
- No. - And this is why you allowed drunken sex

857
00:38:12,116 --> 00:38:14,746
酒后性交  而不允许跨种族发生同样的事
between white cast members and not interracial.

858
00:38:32,778 --> 00:38:33,468
那是什么
What's that?

859
00:38:33,528 --> 00:38:34,538
一个测验
A test.

860
00:38:35,618 --> 00:38:36,548
你找到什么了吗
Find anything?

861
00:38:36,588 --> 00:38:38,188
暂时没有  你呢
Not yet. You?

862
00:38:39,468 --> 00:38:40,348
可能有
Maybe.

863
00:38:42,718 --> 00:38:44,488
这可真是侦探工作啊
This is the real detective stuff, huh?

864
00:38:45,128 --> 00:38:47,727
每台打印机和复印机都会在印出的每一页
Every printer and copy machine leaves a unique signature

865
00:38:47,728 --> 00:38:49,769
留下特有的微点印记
of microdots on every page it prints.

866
00:38:49,779 --> 00:38:51,669
就像是那台打印机的指纹
Like, a fingerprint for that printer.

867
00:38:51,919 --> 00:38:53,619
这张是你打开那封信的印记
Here's the one on the letter you opened.

868
00:38:55,179 --> 00:38:56,318
这两张是从这栋楼里
Now, these are two printed pages

869
00:38:56,319 --> 00:38:58,229
戴安的客户们那儿拿来的
from Diane's clients in the building.

870
00:38:58,709 --> 00:39:00,929
我们看看信是不是从他们的打印机出来的
So we'll see if the letter came from their printers.

871
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:04,320
第一张是房地产客户的
First, the real estate client.

872
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:10,380
不吻合
No match.

873
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:12,930
另一张
Now the other one.

874
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,591
该死
Damn.

875
00:39:20,811 --> 00:39:22,321
我以为会是房地产那家伙做的
I thought it would be the real estate guy.

876
00:39:22,811 --> 00:39:24,521
可能他是在家里打印的
Maybe he printed it at home.

877
00:39:24,891 --> 00:39:26,401
也可能是在打印店弄的
Or at a copy store.

878
00:39:26,841 --> 00:39:28,641
又或者他不止有一台打印机
Or maybe he has more than one printer.

879
00:39:35,902 --> 00:39:37,462
好吧  祝你好运
Okay, good luck.

880
00:39:47,152 --> 00:39:48,182
你在做什么
Hey, what are you doing?

881
00:39:52,603 --> 00:39:53,893
有第三个摄像头
There was a third camera.

882
00:39:55,013 --> 00:39:56,552
看  这是第二天的录像
Look, this is from the next day.

883
00:39:56,553 --> 00:39:58,763
浴缸上方有个锁定的摄像头
There's a locked-off camera above the hot tub.

884
00:39:58,793 --> 00:40:01,403
喂  你怎么一点都不激动
Uh, hello? Why aren't you excited?

885
00:40:01,423 --> 00:40:02,413
激动
I am.

886
00:40:03,143 --> 00:40:04,153
信是从这层楼打印的
It's from this floor.

887
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:06,123
-什么  -给戴安的信
- What? - U-Uh, the letter to Diane?

888
00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:07,583
不是这栋楼的客户打的
It's not from a client in this building,

889
00:40:07,584 --> 00:40:08,814
那人就在这个办公室
it's from this office.

890
00:40:11,094 --> 00:40:12,353
你怎么就不能让我秀一下
Why can't you let me have my moment?

891
00:40:12,354 --> 00:40:13,834
你为什么要让我出洋相
Why do you have to show me up?

892
00:40:21,074 --> 00:40:23,744
有第三个摄像头记录了侵犯事件
There was a third camera recording the assault,

893
00:40:23,745 --> 00:40:25,354
-法官阁下  -是涉嫌侵犯  法官阁下
- Your Honor... - Alleged assault, Your Honor.

894
00:40:25,355 --> 00:40:27,794
辩方没有把证据交出来
And the defense has failed to turn it over.

895
00:40:27,795 --> 00:40:30,574
乔什・布里克纳法官

896
00:40:30,575 --> 00:40:32,245
你知道我有什么搞不懂吗
You know what I don't understand?

897
00:40:34,745 --> 00:40:37,304
西蒙和维罗妮卡之间发生了什么
What happened to Simon and Veronica?

898
00:40:37,305 --> 00:40:39,926
他们一季下来发展得
I-I mean, they were getting so close

899
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:42,196
那么亲密  然后却完全没有下文
during the season, and then, nothing.

900
00:40:42,296 --> 00:40:45,175
有什么合理解释吗
I-I mean, uh, does that ever get explained?

901
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:47,835
我不确定  法官阁下  但如果你想的话
I'm not sure, Your Honor, but I can ask the producers for you,

902
00:40:47,836 --> 00:40:48,595
我可以帮你问一下制作人
if you'd like me to.

903
00:40:48,596 --> 00:40:50,035
还有科特妮
A-And Courtney.

904
00:40:50,036 --> 00:40:52,185
她为什么会被淘汰
I mean, why did she get expelled?

905
00:40:52,186 --> 00:40:53,456
完全就不符合逻辑
It makes no sense.

906
00:40:53,457 --> 00:40:55,147
-她是好人  -法官阁下
- She was the nice one. - Your Honor,

907
00:40:56,067 --> 00:40:57,237
丢失的录像
the missing footage.

908
00:40:57,867 --> 00:40:58,757
没错
Right.

909
00:40:59,017 --> 00:41:00,037
史蒂文斯女士
Ms. Stevens?

910
00:41:00,877 --> 00:41:01,797
录像在哪里
Where is it?

911
00:41:03,017 --> 00:41:03,746
不好意思
I'm sorry?

912
00:41:03,747 --> 00:41:06,526
我下的证据开示令是没写清楚吗
Did I not make my discovery order clear?

913
00:41:06,527 --> 00:41:10,137
好的  这季开始制作人们决定
Oh, um, right. Uh, the producers decided against

914
00:41:10,138 --> 00:41:11,977
停止使用偷拍的录像
using the spy cam footage this season,

915
00:41:11,978 --> 00:41:13,507
所以他们忘记了它的存在
and they forgot it was even there.

916
00:41:13,508 --> 00:41:16,558
没错  人之常情嘛
Right. Yeah, that could happen to anybody.

917
00:41:17,448 --> 00:41:18,418
找出来
Find them.

918
00:41:18,738 --> 00:41:19,638
立刻
Now.

919
00:41:20,058 --> 00:41:20,938
是的  法官阁下
Yes, Your Honor.

920
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:22,178
谢谢  法官阁下
Thank you, Your Honor.

921
00:41:24,249 --> 00:41:25,409
你是怎么了
What's the matter with you?

922
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:27,969
我做出了有利你们的裁决
I just ruled in your favor.

923
00:41:27,979 --> 00:41:29,449
连个微笑都没有吗
Don't I even get a smile?

924
00:41:30,979 --> 00:41:32,229
什么  法官阁下
Excuse me, Your Honor?

925
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:33,339
我的意思是
I mean...

926
00:41:33,529 --> 00:41:34,819
你应该多点微笑
you should smile more.

927
00:41:35,319 --> 00:41:37,448
我都不知道是从哪时起
Yeah, I don't-I don't know when it happened,

928
00:41:37,449 --> 00:41:39,109
女人都不笑了
that women stopped smiling.

929
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:49,099
什么  这什么意思
What? What is this?

930
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,240
这算什么
What-what is it?

931
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,890
她在做什么
What is she doing?

932
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,929
你的协理律师在大笑
Uh, your co-counsel is laughing.

933
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:56,631
我错过什么了吗
Is-- am I missing something here?

934
00:41:57,501 --> 00:41:58,370
没有  法官阁下
No, Your Honor.

935
00:41:58,371 --> 00:42:01,540
我们最近要应付的事情太多了
We've been stretched really thin, recently.

936
00:42:01,541 --> 00:42:02,100
是
Oh, right.

937
00:42:02,101 --> 00:42:05,251
我听说了苏打粉恐慌那事
I heard about that whole baking soda scare.

938
00:42:05,421 --> 00:42:07,200
-戴安  -对  谢谢
- Diane. Diane, Diane. - Yeah, thank you.

939
00:42:07,201 --> 00:42:08,391
谢谢  法官阁下
Thank you, Your Honor.

940
00:42:08,831 --> 00:42:10,011
她没事吧
I-Is she all right?

941
00:42:10,171 --> 00:42:12,702
她就是喜出望外了  法官阁下
She's just pleasantly surprised, Your Honor.

942
00:42:12,882 --> 00:42:14,702
刑事法庭

943
00:42:21,222 --> 00:42:23,692
你没事吧
Uh, are you okay?

944
00:42:24,332 --> 00:42:25,171
我吗
Am I?

945
00:42:25,172 --> 00:42:26,653
没事  怎么了
Yes. Why?

946
00:42:26,973 --> 00:42:28,343
你刚才在里面大笑
You were laughing in there.

947
00:42:28,563 --> 00:42:30,353
是啊  法官太搞笑了
Yes, the judge was funny.

948
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:32,313
天啊
Oh, God.

949
00:42:37,453 --> 00:42:38,993
你还在小剂量嗑致幻蘑菇吗
Are you still microdosing?

950
00:42:40,003 --> 00:42:40,903
没有
Nope.

951
00:42:41,073 --> 00:42:42,894
我不用它的时候就这样
This is what I'm like when I'm not.

952
00:42:43,584 --> 00:42:44,474
你确定吗
Are you sure?

953
00:42:44,584 --> 00:42:47,904
总统有没有把将军肚小猪
Listen, did the president put a potbellied pig

954
00:42:47,974 --> 00:42:49,653
放在白宫地图室
in the White House Map Room?

955
00:42:49,654 --> 00:42:51,264
你说什么
Uh, excuse me?

956
00:42:51,544 --> 00:42:53,474
不  今天有没有一条关于特朗普
No, was there a story today

957
00:42:53,754 --> 00:42:58,325
领养了一头叫皮蒂的猪
about Trump adopting a pig named Petey,

958
00:42:58,545 --> 00:43:00,375
并把它放在白宫的新闻
and keeping him in the White House?

959
00:43:01,805 --> 00:43:03,955
我...没有
I... No.

960
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,105
你看我的样子就像我是个疯子
You're looking at me like that's insane.

961
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:16,646
你好
Hi.

962
00:43:16,746 --> 00:43:17,616
你好
Hi.

963
00:43:18,646 --> 00:43:20,156
你想找我聊聊吗
You wanted to talk to me?

964
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:22,306
是的
Yes. Uh...

965
00:43:23,036 --> 00:43:27,296
我们的无线网络会记录律所人员的登出时间
so our Wi-Fi keeps track of when people in the firm log out.

966
00:43:27,306 --> 00:43:28,175
我们在同一个服务器上
We're all in the same server.

967
00:43:28,176 --> 00:43:29,967
-你知道这点吗  -不知道
- Did you know that? - No.

968
00:43:30,847 --> 00:43:34,657
-这是你的身份识别码  -好吧
- See, that's your I.D. Number. - Okay.

969
00:43:34,847 --> 00:43:37,336
它显示昨天上午10点23分
It shows, at 10:23 a.m. yesterday,

970
00:43:37,337 --> 00:43:38,696
你是最后一个登出的人
you were the very last one to log out.

971
00:43:38,697 --> 00:43:40,046
说得通
Yeah. Makes sense.

972
00:43:40,047 --> 00:43:42,116
我们在兰提莫斯一案的案情简报上滞后了
We're behind on the Lanthimos brief,

973
00:43:42,117 --> 00:43:44,417
我中午都在工作  很晚才走
and I've been working through lunch, and pretty late.

974
00:43:45,168 --> 00:43:47,708
对  但你看  其他人都登出了
Right, but you see, everyone else logged out

975
00:43:47,718 --> 00:43:49,477
当然是因为有疑似化学物的袭击
because, of course, there was a chemical scare,

976
00:43:49,478 --> 00:43:50,748
我们都离开了这栋大楼
and we all left the building.

977
00:43:50,988 --> 00:43:53,698
那我想我忘了登出了
Well, I guess I forgot to log out.

978
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:57,137
不  你是自动登出的
No, you're logged out automatically.

979
00:43:57,138 --> 00:43:59,378
你就是比其他人都晚离开
Uh, you just stayed later than everyone.

980
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,258
正如我说的
Well, like I said,

981
00:44:01,259 --> 00:44:02,929
我的工作滞后很多了
I've-I've been pretty behind.

982
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,379
你为什么不怕蓖麻毒
Why weren't you afraid of the ricin?

983
00:44:08,339 --> 00:44:10,069
最后证明了不是蓖麻毒
It turns out, it wasn't ricin.

984
00:44:10,529 --> 00:44:11,359
对
Right.

985
00:44:12,799 --> 00:44:14,029
但事先没人知道
But no one knew that.

986
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:19,640
信是你送给戴安的  对吗
You sent the letter to Diane, didn't you?

987
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:22,119
我不知道你在说什么
I-I don't know what you're...

988
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,000
事情是这样的
Here's the thing.

989
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,140
你要进监狱
You're going to jail.

990
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:26,119
不  我
No, I...

991
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,010
你会去
Yes.

992
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:31,721
除非你跟戴安道歉
Unless you go apologize to Diane.

993
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:33,641
告诉我你为什么这么做
Tell me why you did it.

994
00:44:40,161 --> 00:44:41,971
工作太多了
There's been so much work.

995
00:44:42,581 --> 00:44:43,301
而且
And...

996
00:44:45,131 --> 00:44:46,650
他们在周五就要案情陈述
they wanted the brief in on Friday,

997
00:44:46,651 --> 00:44:48,442
我没法及时写完
and I can't get it in on time.

998
00:44:48,662 --> 00:44:52,282
我很害怕会被炒掉  我就想多要一天
I... I was so afraid of being fired, I just wanted a day.

999
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:55,592
好
Okay.

1000
00:44:57,432 --> 00:44:58,252
好
Okay.

1001
00:45:01,212 --> 00:45:02,152
好
Okay.

1002
00:45:05,723 --> 00:45:07,713
我还需要你签份东西
Uh, I-I just need you to sign something.

1003
00:45:29,364 --> 00:45:31,214
-太无情了  -什么
- That was cold. - What?

1004
00:45:31,314 --> 00:45:33,313
告诉他要么签字  要么你就向警察告发他
Telling him to sign or you'd turn him over to the cops,

1005
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:34,684
然后你还是向警察告发了他
then, you turned him over to the cops.

1006
00:45:34,685 --> 00:45:35,725
我又不给他干活
I don't work for him.

1007
00:45:36,335 --> 00:45:37,535
我给律所干活
I work for the firm.

1008
00:46:08,137 --> 00:46:09,307
要我看什么
What am I looking for?

1009
00:46:19,737 --> 00:46:20,908
她晕过去了
She passed out.

1010
00:46:38,359 --> 00:46:39,959
我认为你会想
Oh, I think you're gonna want to...

1011
00:46:40,689 --> 00:46:43,589
看这个部分的  史蒂文斯女士

这就是高潮部分
And here's where it gets exciting.

1014
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,489
要么收下要么上庭
Take it or leave it.

1015
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,150
我得到的授权最多就是这个数
I'm not authorized to go any higher.

1024
00:48:04,364 --> 00:48:05,864
不是  戴安

And with Trump, we won't be taxed as much.

#Now, whose birthday is it?#
