1
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,960
真探
第二季 第二集

2
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,820
為什麼這裡會有水漬
How'd a water stain get there?

3
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,110
今年只下過一兩場雨
It rained maybe twice this last year.

4
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,010
好像所有東西都是紙糊的一樣
It's like everything's Papier-mache?

5
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,150
別想了
Stop thinking.

6
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,950
我不喜歡受制於人
I don't like being on a ledge.

7
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,210
沒有人只靠自己的錢就能富起來
Nobody gets rich on their own money.

8
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,610
我從來沒弄懂該拿它怎麼辦
I never really knew what to do with it.

9
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,840
錢
Money.

10
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,530
看著它就像看到了自己
I see that about myself.

11
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,890
你總是說想要擁有大片土地
You always said you want lots of land.

12
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,090
是的
Yes,

13
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,350
可是你需要有子女來繼承這些
but you need children to leave it to.

14
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,850
這些並不真正屬於你
It's never really yours.

15
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,090
生不帶來死不帶去
You don't take it with you.

16
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,380
死了的話什麼也帶不走
You don't take anything with you.

17
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,560
孑然一身 身無長物
Just yourself, whatever that was.

18
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:49,610
就像你一樣 我辛勞一生
I've worked my whole life, same as you.

19
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,110
幸運地躋身富人階級
And not being poor is better than the opposite.

20
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,530
當年在芝加哥的時候
My old man back in Chicago,

21
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,180
我還小
when I was a kid...

22
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,130
我爸去喝酒的時候總會把我鎖進地下室
he used to lock me in the basement when he'd go on a bender.

23
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,260
通常會鎖一晚上
Usually last the night.

24
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,170
第二天再放我出來
Let me out the next day.

25
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,260
我猜他是想保證我的安全
Thought he was keeping me safe, I guess.

26
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:21,060
有一次 我六歲
This one time, I was six...

27
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,880
他把我鎖在地下室
he puts me down there

28
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,520
我醒過來
and I wake up

29
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,990
發現還是鎖著的
and it's locked.

30
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,690
以前也發生過這種事
It had happened before.

31
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,560
反正 我猜他被警察抓了
Anyways, I guess he ended up arrested.

32
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:38,900
我猜的
I guess.

33
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,300
天啊 可憐的孩子
God, baby.

34
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,780
第二天早上
By the second morning...

35
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,060
我就沒有吃的了
I was out of food.

36
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,860
第三天 燈泡燒壞了
The third day, the lightbulb burned out.

37
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,170
裡面漆黑一片
Pitch-black in there.

38
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,610
然後又有了老鼠
That's when the rats started coming out.

39
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,540
我正打著瞌睡
I dozed off and...

40
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,990
感覺到有東西在啃我的指頭
I felt the thing, you know, nibbling my finger.

41
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,240
我醒過來
I woke up.

42
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,920
老鼠正在啃我的指頭
It was, you know, chewing my finger.

43
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,940
你做了什麼
What did you do?

44
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,790
我在黑暗中伸出雙手抓住它
I grabbed it in the dark with my hands

45
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,360
然後往地上砸
and I started smashing it.

46
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,620
一直砸一直砸
And I just kept smashing it...

47
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,240
砸到最後手裡只剩下一團碎肉
till it was nothing but goo in my hands.

48
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,310
我在裡面又待了兩天
Two more days I was in there...

49
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,410
在黑暗裡
in the dark...

50
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,580
直到我爸回了家
till my dad comes home.

51
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:13,570
有時候我真想知道你還經歷過多少
Sometimes I wonder how many things you have like that...

52
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,000
我不知道的事
that I don't know about.

53
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,820
從那時起 我就在想
Ever since, I wondered

54
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,520
如果他沒回家呢
what if he never comes home?

55
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,030
如果我
What if I'm...

56
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,340
還被關在地下室裡
still in that basement

57
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,350
身處黑暗中呢
in the dark?

58
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,150
如果我死在那裡了呢
What if I died there?

59
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,400
這個讓我想到了那些日子
That's what that reminds me of.

60
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,490
什麼
What?

61
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,100
那片水漬
That water stain.

62
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,170
有東西在告訴我
Something's trying to tell me that

63
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,180
這些都是紙餬
it's all Papier-mache.

64
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,240
有東西想要喚醒我
Something's telling me to wake up.

65
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,490
就像
Like...

66
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,000
就像我並非真實存在
like I'm not real.

67
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,020
就像我是在做夢
Like I'm only dreaming.

68
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,800
死亡時間在26號早上4點到9點之間
TOD between 4:00 and 9:00 A.M. morning of the 26th.

69
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,770
毒檢顯示有鎮靜劑 酒精
Tox shows Xanax, alcohol,

70
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,400
死者還患有淋病
also had gonorrhea, for what it's worth.

71
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,840
他眼中有鹽酸
Hydrochloric acid on his eyes.

72
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,190
燒灼痕跡顯示他當時仰躺
Burn pattern tells us he was on his back.

73
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,440
眼眶周圍沒有飛濺痕跡說明滴入得很精準
Lack of spray around the orbital cavity indicates precision.

74
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,610
也許是用某種玻璃制眼部滴管
Some kind of glass eyedropper, maybe.

75
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,660
這屍體是我們的
He's our body.

76
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,770
這一點不會變 所以不如你們先介紹下情況
I don't see that changing, so why don't you all fill me in?

77
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,000
受害者是一起州調查案中的關鍵人物
Victim is a key figure in a state's investigation.

78
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,390
-什麼州調查案 -新立案的
-What state investigation? -Newly formed.

79
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,380
我們在調查媒體針對
We're looking into various allegations

80
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,870
芬奇警局提出的多項指控
made against Vinci in the papers.

81
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,840
芬奇的警探曾將卡史伯雷
Vinci detectives have been on Caspere

82
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,700
作為失蹤人口調查了兩天
as a missing person for two days.

83
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,610
他的房子遭到過入室搶劫
We have the man's house which was burglarized.

84
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:16,760
你們要是想阻止我們的話
You want to shut us out,

85
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,030
我們將匿名繼續我們的調查
we'll continue our investigation autonomously.

86
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,770
在芬奇
In Vinci,

87
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,490
這樣所有人都能保留他們自己的小秘密
so everybody can keep their little corners to themselves,

88
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:26,020
但是 女士們先生們 警局正在調查本案
but, ladies and gentlemen, PD is solving this case.

89
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:30,600
文圖拉我能理解 但是這和州有什麼關係
I understand Ventura. How does the state have any claim here?

90
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,070
我們的警員找到了屍體
Our officer found the body.

91
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,190
這可以把你從那事裡救出來 伍卓夫
This could get you out from under, Woodrugh.

92
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,330
那個女演員的事
That actress bullshit.

93
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,550
你將會作為州調查員參與此案
You'd be detailed as a state's investigator.

94
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,850
你表面上的任務是調查卡史伯雷被害一案
The Caspere homicide is your public investigation.

95
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,690
而調查芬奇警局是你的秘密任務
Looking into Vinci PD is your confidential mandate.

96
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,860
為送出大陪審團審判收集訊息
Gathering intel for a grand jury.

97
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,910
這次調查對州政府很重要
This probe is very important to the governor's office.

98
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,760
就算按你說的做了
Say this goes your way.

99
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,920
事後對我的人有什麼好處
How's it play for my boy here once the dust settles?

100
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:55,590
一切都順利
Everything shakes out,

101
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,200
將給你提供一個繼續任職調查員的機會
you'll be offered a chance to remain investigator.

102
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,720
也許還能榮升州探員
In line for a state detective shield.

103
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,050
我們可以抹掉行政上的所有麻煩
We can wipe away all that admin hassle.

104
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,930
等這事過去
When this is over,

105
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,370
我就想繼續回去當騎警
can I just go back to being on the bike?

106
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,190
手腕和腳踝處可以看到明顯擦傷
You can see abrasions on his wrists and ankles,

107
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,280
軀幹上還有瘀傷
lividity on his torso.

108
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,350
他被倒吊起來過
He was bound upside down.

109
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,840
或者類似姿勢
Or close to it.

110
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,970
地方檢察官很在意芬奇警局
Attorney General's office has concerns about obfuscation

111
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,300
混亂的狀況
on the part of Vinci PD.

112
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,160
貝瑟瑞警探 你是這支隊伍的首席指揮官
Detective Bezzerides, you'll be primary commander of the detail.

113
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,730
第二指揮官是芬奇來的那傢伙 韋科洛
Secondary is gonna be a Vinci guy, Velcoro.

114
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:33,170
遇害者和大筆洛杉磯縣政府資金有牽連
Your DB was into a lot of LA County money.

115
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:36,220
他的房間被闖入 所以你要去趟芬奇
His house was broken into, so you're going to Vinci.

116
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,890
和你搭檔的芬奇警探 據說很腐敗
Vinci detective with you, word is he's bent.

117
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:41,320
接近他 想辦法策反他
Work him. Leverage something to turn him.

118
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,410
一周內我們就會展開全面調查
We'll have a full state probe up inside a week.

119
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,340
卡史伯雷的死是整個事件的切入口
Caspere's death is a window into everything.

120
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,670
整個事件是什麼
And what is everything exactly?

121
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,560
你瞭解芬奇市嗎？
You know anything about the City of Vinci?

122
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:59,240
二十世紀初 那裡是罪犯的天堂
It started out as a vice haven early 1900s.

123
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,930
在二十年代進入了工業化
Went industrial in the '20s.

124
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,870
把居民趕出了工業區
Pushed out residents from manufacturing zones.

125
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,630
是全州污染最嚴重的區域
Worse air polluter in the state.

126
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:14,680
每年生產排放一千兩百萬公斤有毒廢物
Annually emits or processes 27 million pounds of toxic waste.

127
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,710
共和黨當初想阻止我祖父進行
Reds tries to stop my grandfather

128
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,650
工業區域二次規劃
from industrial rezoning.

129
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,400
現在也一樣
Same thing.

130
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,540
自上次贏了環保局訴訟案後蓋爾多夫一直糾纏不休
Geldof's been after us since we won the last EPA suit.

131
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,490
都是為了錢 韋科洛警探
It's about money, Detective Velcoro.

132
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,860
卡史伯雷是社區
Caspere was one of the architects

133
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,240
重建計劃中的建築師之一
of the community renewal initiative.

134
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,470
通過立法
Passing legislature,

135
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,850
八年來我們市能
our city gets to keep 75%

136
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:41,680
保留近75%的稅收收入
of its county tax revenue for eight years.

137
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,900
-那是多少 -大概九百萬美金
-And what's that worth? -About $900 million.

138
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,230
並未算進一般政府資金
Being kept from the county general fund.

139
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,810
恩斯特 那就是我們的錢了
Hell, Ernst, it's our money.

140
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:49,990
在經濟衰退中 芬奇可書寫了神話
Vinci's a goddamn success story in a depressed economy.

141
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,930
州政府會通過這次謀殺案
State's gonna use the homicide to dig into

142
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,010
把這裡查個底朝天 雷
whatever they can, Ray.

143
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,230
卡史伯雷的案子查到哪 你就得跟到哪
Wherever the Caspere case goes, we need you running point.

144
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,100
控制好度 控制流出的訊息
Control the sprawl. Control the flow of information.

145
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,450
芬奇警局你下來就是狄克遜了
Dixon is secondary to you staging out of Vinci.

146
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,670
你會給掌管這個專案組的
You'll be working under a Ventura detective

147
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,410
文圖拉市的警探做副手
commanding the task force.

148
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,030
清楚了嗎 警探
That clear to you, Detective?

149
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,770
收到 副隊 只有一個問題
10-4, Lieutenant. Just one question.

150
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,910
我到底要不要破案
Am I supposed to solve this or not?

151
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,430
只要隨時聯絡就好 韋科洛警探
Just no surprises, Detective Velcoro.

152
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:25,120
雷明白需要優先考慮
Ray accepts dualities must be effected

153
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,050
公眾利益
to serve public interests.

154
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,540
確實
I really do.

155
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,100
-為什麼說被吊起來過 -纖維痕跡
-Bound? -Vinyl fabric.

156
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,390
兩個手腕明顯可見皮帶扣的印痕
You can see the edge of the buckle's imprint on both wrists.

157
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,670
還有膠帶的痕跡
Tape residue.

158
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:42,010
骨盆處傷口是由12口徑散彈槍近距離施射造成的
Pelvic wounds are from a 12-gauge at point-blank range.

159
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,600
算是相當大的傷口了
Some kind of Super-X heavy load.

160
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,890
是眼睛受傷後的事
Came after the eye stuff.

161
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,640
官方死因是心臟病 創傷性心臟病
Official COD is heart attack. Trauma-induced.

162
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,670
致命一擊
A coup de grace.

163
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,360
瘀傷顯示死亡後
Lividity indicates he was placed

164
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,140
他被人為放置成了直立狀態
in upright position after death.

165
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,520
維持了數小時
Spent a few hours that way.

166
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,230
指甲裡沒有痕跡 也沒有指紋
Nothing under his nails, no prints.

167
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,690
完全沒有痕跡嗎？
No trace at all?

168
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,130
眼睛 這是什麼可惡手法啊
His eyes? What the fuck kind of modus operandi is that?

169
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,080
醫生說是鹽酸造成的
Doc said it was hydrochloric acid.

170
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,830
還用了散彈槍
And a shotgun blast happened.

171
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,290
拷問 有人想從他那裡得到訊息
Torture. Somebody wanted to know something.

172
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,940
他的房子也被翻了一遍
Yeah, his house was tossed.

173
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,430
有人開始行動了
Somebody's making a move.

174
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,830
什麼 什麼意思
What? What does that mean?

175
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:26,940
你認識卡史伯雷
You knew Caspere?

176
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,370
北部在進行一些交易
There's deals being done upstate.

177
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,500
-大量資金在運轉 -什麼交易
-A lot of money moving around. -What deals?

178
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,760
-探我的底 是這樣嗎 -法蘭克
-You pull my string? Is that how this works? -Jesus, Frank.

179
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,760
我知道的越多 就越好處理事情
The more I know, the better I can deal with this.

180
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,890
這就是你該處理的事
This is what you deal with.

181
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:41,350
卡史伯雷對我在做的事很重要
Caspere was important to this thing I have going on.

182
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,860
現在我得把這事處理乾淨
I've got to clean it up now.

183
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,360
所以你要仔細調查直到查清為止
So you beat the bushes until you figure it out.

184
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,880
你已經又不是警長的小跟班了 你是一名警探
You ain't no sheriff's brownie. You're a detective.

185
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,230
你最好的線人是誰
Who's your best informant?

186
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,540
你真的假的啊
Are you serious?

187
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,090
去死吧 雷蒙德
Fucking hell, Raymond.

188
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,480
走開
Vaya!

189
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,050
走開
Vaya!

190
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,640
危險
Peligro.

191
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,180
是啊是啊 你媽的
Yeah, yeah, that's right. Fuck me.

192
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,240
很高興見到你
So good to see you.

193
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,360
你怎麼不常來
Why don't you visit me more?

194
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,760
很忙 要工作
Just busy. The job.

195
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,360
工作啊 我們很久沒一起吃飯了
The job. We haven't had dinner in ages.

196
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,150
所以我給你帶了這個 媽
That's why I brought you this, Ma.

197
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,900
別跟我套交情
Don't give me that Ma shit.

198
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,220
現在開始也太晚了
It's too late for us to start all that now.

199
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,510
你得吃點東西
Well, you ought to eat something.

200
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:05,790
我不要麵包糠
Oh, I don't touch bread.

201
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,400
幫我把皮剝掉 保利
Peel that skin off for me, Paulie.

202
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,720
太結實了
So strong.

203
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,710
我前些天看到了你過去的舞伴
I saw your old prom date the other day.

204
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,120
她發胖了
She got fat.

205
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,620
我記得她
I remember her.

206
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,940
等不及要跟男人上床
Couldn't wait to have somebody's baby.

207
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,330
她人很好 對我很好
She was nice. She was nice to me.

208
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,220
所有妹子都對你很好 保利
All the girls are nice to you, Paulie.

209
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,920
你現在還沒察覺出來嗎？
You haven't figured that out by now?

210
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,650
今晚想留下嗎？
Want to stay tonight?

211
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,950
我們可以看個克林特[美國演員]的電影

你可以住你以前的房間
You can have your old room.

213
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,440
我還有事
I'm working on something.

214
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,530
-只是來看看 -她是誰 你個小壞蛋
-Just came to see... -Who is she, you scamp?

215
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,430
放盪的混蛋
You rake.

216
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:55,250
這一點你跟你老爸一模一樣
You got hound's blood just like your daddy.

217
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,180
我可能有段時間不會回來
I'm not gonna be around for a while.

218
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,040
要去洛杉磯還有海岸附近工作
I've got to work around LA and the coast.

219
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,640
特別小組
Special detail.

220
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,710
那就留下吧 我們可以玩牌
Then stay. We can play cards.

221
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,600
你可以住你以前的房間
You can have your old room.

222
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,320
你最近有在餐館上班嗎？
You been getting any more shifts at the restaurant lately?

223
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,730
沒 我有腕管綜合征
Not with my carpal tunnel.

224
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,750
反正我也會失去救濟
I'd lose my state check anyway.

225
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,680
我以為比爾會讓你打黑工
I thought Bill was letting you work off the books.

226
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,260
比爾 別跟我提那個混蛋
Oh, Bill? Don't talk to me about that motherfucker.

227
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,620
你要放棄你自己嗎？
Are you gonna give yourself up...

228
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,430
還是要來硬的
or do this the hard way?

229
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,980
對我來說都不容易
There ain't no easy with me.

230
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,070
你知道的
You know that.

231
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:43,030
該死 我討厭弄得一團糟
Damn. I so hate making a mess.

232
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,310
太多書面工作 你知道的
A lot of paperwork, you know.

233
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,730
那會毀了你
It messes with you.

234
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,180
去死 我服過刑了
Screw you. I did my time in prison.

235
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,680
我們在根據保險審計列出房內物品
We're listing contents against insurance audits.

236
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,110
看是什麼被偷了
See what was stolen.

237
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,620
有人在找什麼東西
Well, somebody was looking for something.

238
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,930
也就解釋了為什麼會拷問他
Would explain the torture.

239
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,010
也許吧 這人還真是總想著做愛啊
Maybe. Guy really thought about fucking a lot.

240
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,610
你能不敲了嗎？
Do you mind?

241
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,510
心理醫生的預約
Psychiatrist appointments.

242
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,450
他在看心理醫生
He was seeing a shrink.

243
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:00,200
我們得給日程表上的每一個預約打電話
We need to call every appointment in that calendar.

244
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,410
把這些圈住的日期跟他的GPS記錄進行比對
Should check all those circled dates against his GPS.

245
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,540
好
Yeah.

246
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:15,690
那電子煙跟你還真搭 很多人都不行
You pull off that e-cig. Not a lot of people do.

247
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:19,290
這個地方每天都有七萬人湧入 對嗎？
This place gets a day-to-day influx of 70,000 people, right?

248
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,390
他們都住在那裡
Where do they live?

249
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:24,870
我也試過電子煙 感覺是它在抽我
I tried one once. It felt like it was smoking me.

250
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,260
真煙不會讓你有那樣的感覺
A real cigarette wouldn't make you feel like that.

251
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,860
也許那有點太像
Maybe it was just a little too close to

252
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:36,350
吸一個機器屌 我也說不好
sucking a robot's dick. I don't know.

253
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,360
卡史伯雷是我的主要投資人
Caspere was my bank on this thing.

254
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,420
我的垃圾處理公司建的這裡
My disposal company set this up.

255
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,360
處理化學廢產品 我們冒了風險
Chemical runoff. We took the risk.

256
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,140
那風險讓你有機會買入中央鐵路走廊
And that risk afforded you the chance to buy into the corridor.

257
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,270
但我要說的是 收購沒有完成
But I'm telling you, that buy was never made.

258
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:06,050
卡史伯雷讓我付了蒙特利十二個地塊的錢
Caspere had me down for 12 parcels below Monterey.

259
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,940
法蘭克 我只能將卡史伯雷
Frank, I can only account for

260
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,240
已經完成的交易列入預算
what purchases Caspere completed.

261
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,360
-你是說 -麥坎德利斯先生
-Are you saying that I---Mr. McCandless,

262
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,890
卡史伯雷先生以短期控股公司的身份
Mr. Caspere had effectively sold Mr. Semyon the land

263
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,390
已經將土地賣給了塞米恩先生
while acting as a short-term holding company.

264
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,810
儘管卡史伯雷遭遇不幸 我們想做的只是
All we're trying to do is ensure the deal

265
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,630
保證我們的土地交易
for our parcel goes through despite Caspere's tragedy.

266
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,770
如果這筆交易有合法記錄
If you got this transaction legally documented,

267
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,120
-就不會有問題 -你知道我們有難處
-it shouldn't be hard. -You know we have issues.

268
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,570
如果我們有他媽的書面記錄
If we had a fucking paper trail,

269
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:29,800
我們就能通過銀行處理了
we'd be doing this through banks.

270
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,180
那我只能說你的處境非常不妙
Well, otherwise I'd say you're in the unenviable position

271
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,740
一個死人欠了你的錢
of being owed money by a dead man.

272
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,730
那可是我的五百萬美元啊
That's $5 million of my money.

273
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,000
等一下 我們的理解是
Hold it, we were given to understand

274
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,850
我們的合作夥伴是卡特拉史特
that our partnership was with Catalast.

275
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,950
如果卡史伯雷先生付了款 那確實如此
Had Mr. Caspere made payment, it would have been.

276
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,810
你的名字也會被新增在負責開發的
And your name would have been added to the corporate charter

277
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,050
公司名單上
for the development.

278
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,120
-但他沒有 -我怎麼知道這是真的
-But he didn't. -How do I know that?

279
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,210
我們不是混混 法蘭克
We're not gangsters, Frank.

280
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,310
這我們不能接受
This is unacceptable.

281
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:53,660
既然卡史伯雷的條件已經無效
Since Caspere's remaining interests have been voided,

282
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,190
我可以給你同樣的土地 同樣的價錢
I can provide you the same parcel, same price.

283
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,190
-七百萬美金 -同樣
-Seven million. -The same?

284
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,000
報給我們的是一千萬
We were quoted 10.

285
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,140
不是我報的
Not by me.

286
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,310
混蛋
Motherfuck.

287
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,290
王八蛋
Motherfuck me.

288
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,730
我們賣了芬奇的資產投給卡史伯雷和...
We sold off our Vinci assets to put in with Caspere and...

289
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,020
為了這筆交易我全部變現了
I went liquid for this deal.

290
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,480
我能說什麼 法蘭克 聽著就像
What can I tell you, Frank? It sounds like

291
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,510
卡史伯雷先生在拿你的錢當兒戲
Mr. Caspere was playing fast and loose with your capital.

292
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,520
我能再次提供補償買進
I can offer you the buy-in again,

293
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,360
但你似乎缺錢
but it sounds like you're short.

294
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,300
我可以再拿回來
I can get it back.

295
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,830
再找筆錢 會值得的
Find another stake, it'd be worth your while.

296
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,570
失陪了
Excuse me.

297
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,850
該死 他說七百萬
Shit. Seven he says?

298
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,920
這個時候七百萬對我來說和一千萬一樣
Seven's the same as 10 to me at this point.

299
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,030
都不能捨掉零
Can't round off zero.

300
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,920
我被削弱了嗎？
Am I diminished?

301
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,430
那是我要告訴該死的...
Is that my message to the goddamn...

302
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,690
我的合作夥伴拿走了我的錢
My business partner takes my money,

303
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,280
被拷問並殺害了
gets tortured and murdered,

304
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,590
然後呢
and what?

305
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:15,030
我等著這位韋科洛把這變得像羅克福德嗎？
I'm waiting on this Velcoro burnout to make like Rockford?

306
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,250
通知所有人
Get everybody.

307
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,870
史坦 伊瓦爾 他表親 我們格蘭岱爾人
Stan, Ivar, his cousins, our Glendale people.

308
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,420
他媽的布萊克 不管他去哪裡了
Fucking Blake, wherever the fuck he's been.

309
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,430
法蘭克 我們可以看一下你的剩餘資產
Frank, we can look at your remaining assets.

310
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,240
我什麼都沒了
I don't have any fucking assets.

311
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,800
房子和賭場都被雙倍抵押了
The house and the poker room were double mortgaged.

312
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,200
這就是他媽的全部
This was fucking everything.

313
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,670
你是這個意思 法蘭克 為什麼
That's what you meant. Frank, why did you--

314
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,800
別管了 我會再拿回來的
Leave it. I'll get it back.

315
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,630
每一分錢
Every dime.

316
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:53,540
大概是一個月前
That was maybe a month ago.

317
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,270
九月
September.

318
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,270
慶祝紅延線破土動工
Celebrated breaking ground on the Red Line extension

319
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:03,050
和即將製作的一部好萊塢大電影
and the imminent production of a major Hollywood movie.

320
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,840
城市的頭條新聞 班參與了...
Big news for the city. And Ben had a hand--

321
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,770
你能告訴我們卡史伯雷先生
Could you tell us anything about

322
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,900
在聚會上的行為舉止嗎？
Mr. Caspere's demeanor at the party?

323
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:13,090
他和誰在一起嗎 女伴
Was he with someone? A date?

324
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,800
他最近在約會的一個女人
A woman he had been seeing.

325
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,880
我覺得是
I think.

326
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,160
不太記得她名字了
Can't quite recall her name.

327
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:30,470
-恩斯特 -我記得是塔莎小姐 先生
-Ernst? -A Miss Tascha, I believe, sir.

328
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:33,320
他和很多女孩約會嗎 多到你不知道名字
He see a lot of girls? Enough you wouldn't know her name?

329
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,450
班的社交生活很活躍
I believe Ben maintained an active social life.

330
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:40,890
那方面我們沒什麼交集
We didn't often cross paths that way.

331
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,770
我們只是一起處理公事
We only met over business.

332
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,480
你有沒有可能有那次聚會的照片呢 先生
You wouldn't have any pictures from the party, sir, by any chance?

333
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,700
能幫助我們找到那個女孩的東西
Something to help us identify the girl.

334
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,450
卡史伯雷對他的社區很敬業
Mr. Caspere was dedicated to his community.

335
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,950
95個居民的社區
A community of 95 residents.

336
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,630
你上次見他時他看起來有在為什麼事煩惱嗎？
He didn't seem distressed by anything last you saw him?

337
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,370
沒有 只是讓人頭痛的老問題
No, just the usual headaches.

338
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,530
縣裡不能原諒我們的獨立
County can't forgive our independence.

339
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:15,510
除了一起工作你也不怎麼和他聊
And you didn't talk to him much outside of business get-togethers?

340
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:18,230
還有偶爾的內閣會議
And cabinet meetings occasionally.

341
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,660
好吧
Well...

342
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,990
謝謝你 閣下 很有幫助
Thank you, Your Honor. That'll do us.

343
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:23,730
你記得聚會那晚
Do you recall what time

344
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:26,320
卡史伯雷先生幾點離開你家的嗎？
Mr. Caspere left your house night of the party?

345
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,530
11點左右 也可能是12點
I believe around 11:00, maybe 12:00.

346
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:32,180
-大概是結束的時候 -和塔莎小姐一起
-Around the time things broke up. -With Miss Tascha?

347
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:33,970
謝謝你 閣下
Thank you, Your Honor.

348
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,130
謝謝你們 警探
Thank you, Detective.

349
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,910
我希望這案子盡快解決
I'd like to see this solved as soon as possible.

350
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:47,050
拿到了他的銀行記錄 電話
Got his bank records, phone calls.

351
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:49,170
但還不知道他於此有沒有關係
Don't know if he had any of the lines, though.

352
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,420
開始覺得他一定有別的帳戶
Starting to think he must have kept other accounts.

353
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,510
小子 匯報時再說吧
Hey, kid, just save it for the debrief.

354
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,240
你為什麼在這裡
Why are you here?

355
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,770
你甚至都不是調查員 對嗎？
You're not even an investigator, right?

356
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,150
特別小組 這案子歸州里管
Special detail. State owns the case.

357
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,120
還找到了他的律師
Found his lawyer, too.

358
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,110
為這破事不得不跑遍洛杉磯
Had to hump all over LA for this shit.

359
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,170
還有銀行的那個死基佬
Oh, and this one fag at the bank

360
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,940
好像要挑逗我
tried, like, hitting on me.

361
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,960
差點揍了這傢伙
Almost clocked the guy.

362
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,910
是嗎 你為什麼要那樣做
Yeah? Why would you do that?

363
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,770
我沒惡意 種馬
Hey, no trouble here, stud.

364
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,410
別把我攪和進去 好嗎？
Just leave me out of it, all right?

365
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,280
這些是他保險公司提供的表單
His insurance had these forms.

366
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,670
可能是卡史伯雷被盜的東西
Items likely stolen from Caspere's place,

367
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,570
我們可以去各個當鋪查檢查
we can put out pawn sheets on them.

368
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,070
你們查到什麼了
What'd you guys get?

369
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,530
這個年輕人 他有爆炸消息
The young man here, he got a dynamite anecdote.

370
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,880
上次提款是五天前
Last withdrawal was five days ago.

371
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,330
除了這次都很規律
Nothing jumps except this.

372
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:03,360
每月一次 一次4000美元
Once a month, $4,000 cash withdrawal.

373
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,640
讓我看看
Let me see this.

374
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,080
提款好像都是在
The withdrawals seem to come around the time

375
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,310
他日程表的空白時間裡
of these blank days in his calendar.

376
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,260
-你拿到他的GPS記錄了嗎 -嗯
-Did you get his GPS? -Yeah.

377
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,070
給
Here.

378
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,740
這些日期什麼都沒有
There's nothing on those dates.

379
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,010
車哪裡都沒去 他的梅賽德斯是租的
Car didn't go anywhere. Says his Mercedes was a lease.

380
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,110
這就說得通了
Well, that makes sense.

381
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,170
不是市政 是卡特拉史特集團
Not city. Catalast Group.

382
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:39,860
卡特拉史特為什麼要幫他租車
Why'd Catalast lease him a car?

383
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,590
也許有人該打電話問問
Maybe somebody should call them.

384
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,360
你跟他關係很好嗎？
You tight with him?

385
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,110
我跟誰都不怎麼樣
I'm not tight with anybody.

386
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,240
我能明天再繼續嗎？
Can I pick up here tomorrow?

387
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:07,310
當然
Sure.

388
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,680
我先走了
I gotta go.

389
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,450
-怎麼了 -這些坐標
-What? -These coordinates.

390
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,800
全都在北邊
They're up north.

391
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:42,450
蒙特利縣 夫勒史諾市 吉爾羅伊
Monterey County, Fresno, Gilroy.

392
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:43,790
大多都是週末去的
A lot of them on weekends.

393
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,260
查德呢
Where's Chad?

394
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:05,850
他不會來了
He's not coming.

395
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:08,770
怎麼了 為什麼
What? Why?

396
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,550
你居然還有臉問為什麼
You're gonna ask me why? Really?

397
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:12,980
你這個變態
You fucking prick.

398
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,390
怎麼 你是說學校那事嗎？
What, that thing at the school?

399
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,620
我向查德道過歉了 而且這是我倆之間的事
I apologized to Chad and it's between me and him.

400
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,540
不光是這件事 你心裡明白
That's not the end of the story and you know it.

401
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,330
-還有什麼 -警察說有人打了威特·康羅伊
-How's that? -The police said that someone beat up Wit Conroy.

402
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:24,190
說他被打與發生在學校的某些爭執有關
Said it had something to do with a schoolyard altercation.

403
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,460
我不清楚是怎麼回事
Well, I don't know anything about that,

404
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,950
但有時候孩子不打不成器
but sometimes a good beating provokes personal growth.

405
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,610
你也不會幹別的了 是嗎？
It's not like you know any other way, right?

406
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,830
該死的
God damn it.

407
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,310
查德跟你在一起時總是很焦慮
Chad gets anxious when he has to be around you.

408
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,870
你知道嗎 你都沒有察覺吧
Do you get that? Do you even see it?

409
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,070
胡扯 我 我們會聊天
That's bullshit. I--we talk,

410
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:43,190
我們會一起搭模型 給彼此寫信
we build models, we write letters,

411
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,070
我還給他買了錄音筆
I got him this recorder.

412
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,460
可是他給你回過幾次信
And how many times has he written you back?

413
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,120
他需要我 好嗎 只是他自己還沒意識到
He needs me, all right, even if he doesn't know it.

414
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:50,190
如果他感到焦慮 可能只是因為他知道
And if he gets anxious, it's probably because he knows

415
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,200
他又得聽他媽說他爸的壞話了
he's gonna have to listen to his mom talk shit about his dad.

416
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,520

417
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,670
你是個混蛋
You're a bad person.

418
00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:00,120
-你的存在對我兒子沒有好處 -別這麼說
-And you're bad for my son. -Don't say that.

419
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,610
你是瞭解我的
You know me.

420
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,430
我們曾經相愛 而且
We had something and--

421
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,330
自從我為你做了那件事 情況就失控了
What I done for you, things started to slip away from me--

422
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:10,820
不 你做那件事不是為了我 雷
No, you didn't do that for me, Ray.

423
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,250
別說那是為我做的
Don't you dare say that you did that for me.

424
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,880
我有權見我兒子
I had a right by any natural law.

425
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,080
我有權力
I had a right.

426
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,240
我來就是想當面跟你說這事
I came to tell you this in person.

427
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:26,970
理查本不想讓我來的
Richard didn't want me to.

428
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:30,200
我申請了監督探訪的緊急條令
I'm getting an emergency writ for supervised visits.

429
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,330
你說什麼 不
What? No.

430
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,050
我們正在申請單獨監護權

431
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,670
什麼
What?

432
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,290
為什麼
No, why?

433
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:40,410
因為我們不能再這樣下去了
Because this can't go on.

434
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,130
真的不能
It can't.

435
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,680
看看你自己吧
I mean, look at yourself.

436
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,160
你不能 求你了 求求你 不要
You will not--no. Please, please, don't.

437
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,400
你以前是很正派的
You used to have something, a decency.

438
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,690
你曾經非常正派
You were good at being decent

439
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:56,450
直到有事發生
until something happened.

440
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:58,800
倘若周圍一切安好 你便安好
You were fine as long as everything else was fine.

441
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,220
但是一旦有事發生
But then something happened

442
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,440
你就完全變了一個人
and you weren't strong enough to stay decent.

443
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,250
-現在 -你別想就這麼跑了
-And now---You won't get away with it.

444
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:07,400
我會把整座城市燒成灰燼
I will burn this entire fucking city to the ground first.

445
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:12,010
我還會申請親子鑑定 雷
I'll petition for a paternity test, too, Ray.

446
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:14,540
-如果你再逼我 -不 求你 別這樣
-If you make me. -Don't. Please. Please, don't.

447
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,950
不要做親子鑑定 求你了
Don't do that, please.

448
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:19,960
該死的 他是我的一切...
God damn it, look, he's--he's all I--

449
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,390
我承認 我是個人渣
all right, I'm a piece of shit,

450
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,940
但那孩子對我這糟爛的一生來說意味著一切
but that boy is all I have in my entire shitty life.

451
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,570

No, babe.

452
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,500
那你明白他應該過更好的生活吧
Then don't you know he deserves better?

453

那些人為什麼要這樣對你

463
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,670
簡直太瘋狂了 是不是

我不知道 他們

是不是你的某些行為

刑事案件
of Vinci in LA County.

545
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,450
本次調查早已勢在必行
This investigation is long overdue.

546
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,930
我們請各州
And we ask all state

547
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:46,800
各市的警局合作...
and city officials to cooperate...

548
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:49,600
司法部長剛剛宣佈要徹查此案
Attorney general just announced a shakedown.

549
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,820
你不應該把那帶來
You're not supposed to bring that here.

550
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,070
這是放空的10
It's short 10.

551
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,120
你接替吉恩·史萊特里時
When you took over from Gene Slattery,

552
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,690
我們訂了規矩
we established terms.

553
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:05,870
放空不在其中 法蘭克
Short wasn't part of it, Frank.

554
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:07,360
我在努力湊
I'm pulling some stuff together.

555
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,910
增加收入來源
Adding revenue streams.

556
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,180
我只需要幾星期
I just need a couple of weeks.

557
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,750
我賣了出租的農場和垃圾處理業務
I sold the rent farms and waste disposal business

558
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,670
再湊上鐵路項目的錢 你也懂的
to pull together the corridor money. You know that.

559
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,730
你仍然有牌室的回扣
You still owe the poker room kickback.

560
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:18,660
如果有必要你再賣一些地
Sell some of that land if you need to.

561
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,270
卡史伯雷死的時候還欠我的錢
Caspere died with my money in his pocket.

562
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,850
外面有人對牌室感興趣
I've had outside interest re: the poker room.

563
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:28,380
可能會報個高價
Think they can turn a higher gross.

564
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,840
-高額利息 -什麼外人
-Higher vig. -What outside interest?

565
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:34,240
跟你說一下 現在是賣方市場
Just so you know, it's a seller's market.

566
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,950
你真要為了一萬塊坑我嗎？
You seriously gonna bust my balls over 10 Gs?

567
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:42,000
我辛苦經營了六年
I kept this place tight as a drum six years.

568
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:45,400
非法工人聯盟的事誰壓住的
Who squashed the undocumented workers alliance?

569
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:46,830
肇事逃逸呢
That hit and run?

570
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:48,770
你兒子臉上全是白粉
Your son's face was so coke-dusted

571
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:50,230
跟個小丑似的
he looked like a clown.

572
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,160
東尼 是的
Tony, yeah.

573
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,060
我的兒子恐怕
My son, I fear,

574
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,960
已經失去理智了
is losing his fucking mind.

575
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,250
像他過世的母親
Like his departed mother.

576
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,470
有些人就是受不了高層次的挑戰
Some people can't handle the deep trip.

577
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:09,330
我恐怕他會毀掉一切
I fear he is a destroyer.

578
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:12,730
我那個年代 只要敢想就能賺錢
In my day, you understand, it was about consciousness expansion,

579
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:15,360
探索致富的秘密
tracing the unseen web.

580
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:18,400
養孩子真是讓人失望
Children are a disappointment.

581
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:22,290
永遠都不要養孩子 法蘭克
Remain unfettered, Frank.

582
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,650
快找到殺死卡史伯雷的兇手了嗎？
They closer on who killed Caspere?

583
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,020
卡特拉斯接手他的生意
Catalast is taking over his action.

584
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,620
一切都在推進
Everything's happening.

585
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:38,040
我在奧克蘭給我那倒霉孩子弄家夜店
My farkakte offspring I will set up with a club in Oakland.

586
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,400
讓他去別處當紈褲子弟吧
Let him be a boy prince elsewhere.

587
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,590
殺死卡史伯雷的兇手拿走了我的錢
Whoever killed Caspere, they have my money.

588
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,350
-怎麼會 -控股公司賬面上一片空白
-How's that? -The holding company is empty.

589
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,640
那塊地根本就沒買下來
The land was never purchased

590
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,560
我這輩子的心血全憑空消失了
and I'm fucked out of my life's work.

591
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,890
我需要有人給我指路 奧斯丁
Now I need a direction to turn, Austin.

592
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:53,850
否則我可能要拉人下水了
Or I may just start pulling down walls.

593
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,250
這可不像聰明人的做法 小子
That doesn't sound like a smart play, gever.

594
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:01,360
誰都不喜歡含沙射影
Innuendo is nobody's friend.

595
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,710
你不擔心殺死卡史伯雷的人
You're not worried whoever did Caspere

596
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,400
可能會有更大的陰謀嗎？
might be part of something bigger?

597
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,760
暗地裡想從鐵路項目上撈一筆什麼的
Muscling in on the corridor, secret handshakes and whatnot.

598
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,190
班有他自己的慈善機構
Ben had his own charity and what punched his ticket

599
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:14,720
雇殺手的可能是某一個人
could have come from some personal pocket.

600
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:20,240
沒人能從我手裡搶 法蘭克
Nobody muscles me, Frank.

601
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,580
州檢察官會收我的錢
State attorney will get his piece,

602
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,780
卡史伯雷的事情也會了結
Caspere will get closed,

603
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:27,780
世界還是繼續運轉
the world will turn uncaring of our struggles.

604
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:36,790
卡史伯雷的案子結了之後 我要內線消息
They close Caspere, I want a tip.

605
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:39,040
我要和兇手單獨待幾分鐘
I want time alone with the guy that did it.

606
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,560
你很勤奮 法蘭克
You are industrious, Frank.

607
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:47,110
我希望你能熬過這一劫
I want to see you make it through this.

608
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:50,470
是誰想要接手牌屋
Who wants to move on the poker room?

609
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,860
下周多加一萬五的利息 法蘭克
Kickback's an extra 15 next week, Frank.

610
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,950
再下一周加兩萬兩千五
22.50 the week after.

611
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:56,720
如果你到時候補不上
You don't come through then,

612
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,740
我就得照顧一下外人了
I have to entertain other interests.

613
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,700
生意場上無情面
It's business.

614
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,860
當然
Sure.

615
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,460
這就稍微能解釋通一點了 對嗎？
Now this is making some sense, right?

616
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,650
解釋了他家牆上的畫
It explains his home decor.

617
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:24,720
每月取現金很可能就是付嫖資的
Nine to one the cash withdrawal every month was a hooker blowout.

618
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,240
這傢伙經常會接觸犯罪分子
Guy's regularly in touch with criminal elements.

619
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,020
可能是皮條客
Pimps,

620
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,390
闖進去 把他帶到別的地方拷打
they break in, tortured him somewhere.

621
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:35,100
或許是想讓他說出存錢的地方
Probably trying to get access to assets.

622
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,950
我覺得比這要複雜
I think it's more twisted than that.

623
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,100
他受的折磨 他家裡那堆鬼東西
What was done to him, that shit in his house.

624
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,970
我們恐怕只接觸到了冰山一角
He's into a lot of stuff we're just scratching.

625
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:45,850
我們可以讓伍卓夫去查妓女和三陪
Well, we can have Woodrugh work prosts, escort services.

626
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,940
他肯定很擅長查這個
He'd be smooth for that.

627
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:50,910
是啊
Sure.

628
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:57,760
你聽說過那句蒼蠅和蜂蜜的俗語嗎？
You know that expression about flies and honey?

629
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:57,760
蜂蜜比醋能更抓到更多蒼蠅
（指對人態度好更容易拉攏人心）
You catch more flies with honey than you do with vinegar


630
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,440
聽過 可是我抓蒼蠅有屁用
Mmm. The fuck do I want with a bunch of flies?

631
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,840
沒有蒼蠅你就沒有誘餌
Well, you don't have flies, you can't fly-fish.

632
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,180
這是什麼鬼地方
What is this fucking place?

633
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,170
郊區人逃到這
Suburban flight,

634
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,150
重工業都遷往內陸或海外
heavy manufacturing moves inland or overseas,

635
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,530
工廠倒閉
plants close.

636
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,970
只有這裡 一群聰明的資本家們
Except here, a bunch of good capitalists

637
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:31,520
被廉價地租 減稅刺激政策
ran in for cheap leases, tax incentives,

638
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,910
移民勞動力 血汗工廠吸引過來
immigrant labor, sweatshop economics.

639
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,310
你對這些沒有意見嗎？
You don't have a problem with that?

640
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:37,060
沒有 我強烈懷疑
No, my strong suspicion is

641
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,390
每個人的生活都是咎由自取
we get the world we deserve.

642
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:46,500
你為什麼來這個地方
Why are you here? This place?

643
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:50,250
我在洛杉磯警局工作過
I did time in the LA Sheriff's.

644
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,010
只是想多賺點
I just needed better pay.

645
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,160
工作時間規律點
Regular hours.

646
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:59,020
我有個兒子
I had a son.

647
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,500
他們肯定跟你說過我的事吧
They told you about me, I'm sure.

648
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,260
說過 上面說你是個不錯的調查員
Yeah, bosses said you're a solid investigator.

649
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:11,880
你肯定不這麼認為 但我絕不扯淡
I know you wouldn't think it, but I don't bullshit.

650
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,160
你要是扯淡了怎麼辦
What would you say if you did?

651
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,690
我能告訴你我那操蛋婚姻的故事嗎？
Can I tell you what you may or may not have heard,

652
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:17,670
你可能聽過 就算沒有也肯定會聽說
but almost definitely will hear about my busted marriage?

653
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,470
傳聞說我殺了傷害我妻子的那個混蛋
Rumors have me killing this piece of filth hurt my wife.

654
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:22,550
還說我給南城的一個黑幫做事
Same rumors put me in hock to a Southland mob.

655
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,260
而且如果你問對了人 你還可能聽說
And if you know who to ask, you might hear I like to wet

656
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,800
我有一大堆的惡習
now and then from a number of bad habits.

657
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,660
-這些傳聞有真的嗎 -有
-Any of that true? -Oh, yeah.

658
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,880
-哪部分 -一堆惡習
-Which parts? -Bad habits.

659
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,910
一樣都沒戒掉過
Never lost one yet.

660
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,130
你呢
You?

661
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:40,330
我分不清什麼習慣是好的
Oh, I don't distinguish between good and bad habits.

662
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,790
帶那麼多刀是怎麼回事
What's with all the knives?

663
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:45,300
要是你遇見的每個人都能制服你
Could you do this job if everyone you encountered

664
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,250
你還能幹好這份工作嗎？
could physically overpower you?

665
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,590
別說當好警察了
I mean, forget police work.

666
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:51,700
任何人光是處在那樣的境地都會發瘋的
No man could walk around like that without going nuts.

667
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,040
所以這些是用來制衡的 有道理
So they're equalizers. Makes sense.

668
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,010
不 不幹這行我也會帶著
No, I'd still wear them if I wasn't on the job.

669
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,630
男女間最根本的區別就是
Fundamental difference between the sexes

670
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:03,240
一方可以空手殺死另一方
is that one of them can kill the other with their bare hands.

671
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:05,460
不管塊頭多大的男人敢碰我
Man of any size lays hands on me,

672
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:07,390
我讓他一分鐘內流血身亡
he's gonna bleed out in under a minute.

673
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:11,990
你要知道 我支援女權
Well, just so you know, I support feminism.

674
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,080
我跟眾多女性一樣覺得自己身材不好
Mostly by having body image issues.

675
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:24,160
皮特勒提到的那個是什麼
What's that thing Pitlor mentioned?

676
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:26,770
你的父親 善良人公社
Your dad, the Good People?

677
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:30,760
七八十年代末 在蓋爾南維爾附近
It was this, like, commune around Guerneville

678
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,570
建的一個公社
in the late '70s, '80s.

679
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,050
嬉皮士之類的
Hippie shit.

680
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,330
你得自己照顧自己 是嗎？
You had to look out for yourself, huh?

681
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:46,850
那是你
That's you.

682
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:57,030
芬奇市 邁向明天

683
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:08,410
我試圖讓我們兩個更瞭解對方
Look, I'm trying to effect transparency between us.

684
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:09,760
原因是...
The reason being...

685
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:13,760
我不知道你知不知道
I don't know if you know this,

686
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,570
但是我們 這次調查
but us, the investigation,

687
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,320
我不覺得會有什麼結果
I don't think it's supposed to work.

688
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,180
為什麼
Why is that?

689
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,890
這是州檢察官命令的調查
State Attorney's investigation.

690
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:25,650
他們肯定監聽了你 那個小孩也是
They must have tapped you. You know, the kid, too.

691
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,510
他們為什麼不找州里的大陪審團調查
Why wouldn't they have a team of state grand jury investigators

692
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,660
偏偏找了你和那個小孩
working Vinci instead of just you and the kid?

693
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:34,040
為什麼州檢察官不全程施壓
Why wouldn't the SA do a full-court press on this?

694
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,050
你想說實話
You want honest?

695
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,990
告訴我 你肯讓步多少
Tell me, how compromised are you?

696
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:56,190
好吧 晚安
Anyways, good night.

697
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,920
這是什麼 你為什麼不告訴我
What is that? Why didn't you tell me?

698
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:38,100
我操
What the fuck?

699
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:38,560
加州高速巡警隊員 以拘捕要挾萊西·林德爾與其發生關係

700
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:44,650
因為這只是一堆狗屁不通的狗屎
'Cause that right there is a bunch of unbridled horseshit.

701
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,300
你知道那妹子嗎？
You read about the girl?

702
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,420
自己犯了事要進監獄
Goes to jail for one more fuckup,

703
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,800
就倒打一耙說是我的錯 僅此而已
tries to say I did something wrong. That's it.

704
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,150
那你為什麼不告訴我
Then why didn't you tell me?

705
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,810
因為我不想再想這件事
'Cause I don't want to think about it.

706
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,810
-你會失業嗎 -不會
-Are you gonna lose your job? -No.

707
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:59,150
我在州檢察官那接到個新任務
I got a new assignment through the state attorney.

708
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,980
我以後就是偵探了
I'm gonna be a detective after.

709
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:03,090
聽著 報紙提到了
Listen, this paper talks about you

710
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:04,770
你參與了蒙特內格羅安全隊的事
being in this Black Mountain Security thing.

711
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:08,020
我告訴過你 我不會再提蒙特內格羅的事了
I told you, I don't talk about the desert.

712
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:11,250
但是這個蒙特內格羅安全隊做了很多壞...
But this Black Mountain Security, they did things, bad--

713
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:25,380
所以就這樣 你就這樣走了嗎？
So that's it? You're just taking off?

714
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,700
我告訴過你了
Come on, I just told you.

715
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:30,610
我要去洛杉磯工作一段時間
I got to go to LA to work for a while.

716
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:33,480
特殊事件 特殊調查
Special detail. Special investigator.

717
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,160
-就是這樣 -你身上酒氣熏天
-That's it. -God, you smell like a bar rag.

718
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:38,720
誰說伏特加沒有味道 全是放屁
They say vodka don't smell, but that's bullshit.

719
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,550
你聞著就像我叔叔
You smell just like my uncle.

720
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:42,580
我只是去南方待一段時間
I'm just going down south a while.

721
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,420
僅此而已
That's it.

722
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,750
-那你的公寓呢 -還是在那啊
-And your apartment? -Still there, Em.

723
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,540
你到底在做什麼
What are you doing?

724
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:01,070
我受不了了 我盡力了
I can't do this anymore. I tried.

725

No.

728

你幾乎不說話
You barely talk.

729
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:17,020
我不瞭解你家人 你也不想瞭解我的
I don't know your family. You don't want to know mine.

730
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,350
-你到底是誰 -滾蛋吧
-Who are you? -Oh, fuck off.

731

我他媽還能是誰
Who the fuck am I supposed to be?

-我不知道你會是誰 -我的天啊
-I don't know who you're supposed to be. -Jesus Christ.

733
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,130
沒錯 滾蛋 滾
Yeah, fuck off. Go.

734
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:28,660
不管你發生了什麼 我都不會管你
God, whatever happened to you, I can't fix it.

735
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:31,790
我沒什麼問題
There's nothing wrong with me.

736

You can't give me more than this.

739

你不 你不正常
You're not--you're not right.

740

有時候我和你在一起 我能感到...
Sometimes I'm with you and I can tell that...

741
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,560

Fuck it.

我不能再見你了 保羅

和你一起 受傷的總是我
You hurt me seeing you.

747

00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:20,340
把我丟進這坑裡 居然還來看我
Surprised you're visiting this pit you stuck me with.

752
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:22,290
在這工作累死人了
It's hard work up in here.

753
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,770
我必須說 回到這我一點都不懷念
I gotta say, being back in here, I don't miss it.

754
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,220
就像是多年的頭痛病又犯了
Seems like a headache looking back.

755
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:29,730
沒錯就是讓人頭痛

麻煩得很
It's a pain in the ass, you know?

794

我的人也不太擅長處理證據
And my people ain't exactly proficient in evidence handling.

803
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:12,880

813
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:38,100
你覺得怎麼樣
How'd that be?

814
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,750
局長 法蘭克 我不想當局長
Chief? I don't want that, Frank.

815
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:43,450
我管你想不想當 你怎麼了
Did I ask you if you want that? What's up with you, huh?

816
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:45,260
我可是在幫你上位
I'm lining stuff up for you here.

817
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:47,610
局長一年能撈三十萬
That job pays 300K a year.

818
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:49,880
有這筆錢 你能請一大幫家庭律師了
You could hire a hell of a family lawyer for that.

819
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:53,900
這個怎麼樣
That, right there.

820
00:51:56,440 --> 00:52:01,440
你...你還記得我們倆是怎麼搞到一起的嗎？
You--you remember how we got together?

821
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,040
我記得你要拋屍
I remember you dumping a body.

822
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:06,920
我給你辦事的原因
The reasons for all this, all that,

823
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:09,280
對我來說沒有任何意義了
might not exist for me anymore.

824
00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:10,650
你明白了嗎？
You see?

825
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,160
我沒理由一直為你做事
I got no reason to keep at this.

826
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,160
你是說你覺得蹲一輩子大獄
Meaning you'd consider life in prison, what,

827
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:19,660
還不錯嗎？
a positive?

828
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:21,300
我可沒那麼說
No, I ain't saying that either.

829
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:24,010
這麼說 你還有我不知道的後路
What, you have other options here I'm not privy to?

830
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:26,130
真逼到那份上
Everybody's got the one option,

831
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,140
都能找到後路
you want it bad enough.

832
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:31,520
你以前可是條漢子
You used to be a hard man.

833
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:34,320
-我現在累了 -那就給我好好休息
-I'm tired. -Then get some sleep.

834
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:36,320
先查了那地方再說
after you check the place out.

835
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:38,810
完事以後來找我
Get back to me.

836
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:40,900
還有 雷
And, Ray...

837
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:46,750
以後別再和我說這種屁話
I don't want to hear you talk like that again.

838
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,830
雷 再來一瓶啤酒嗎？
You want another beer, Ray?

839
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:06,430
不用了 我...我得走了
No, I--I gotta take off, I guess.

840
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,100
他的事可真多啊
He's keeping you busy.

841
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,550
是啊 太太
Yes, ma'am.

842
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:21,910
你應該放鬆一下
You ought to take some time.

843
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,630
去度個假
A vacation.

844
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:26,150
你去過聖米格爾德阿連德[墨西哥]嗎？
Have you ever been to San Miguel de Allende?

845
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:28,070
-沒有 -那是我的家鄉
-No. -That's where I'm from.

846
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:32,630
那裡有高山 瀑布 廣場
Mountains, waterfalls, this plaza.

847
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:35,290
是嗎 聽起來不錯
Well, that sounds really nice.

848
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,090
也許哪天我能帶你去看看
Maybe I could show it to you sometime.

849
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:42,070
除非我死了 否則沒法休假
I think the only way I get a vacation is if I croak.

850
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,800
那你就該換個工作
You should get another job, then.

851
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:45,820
親愛的 來不及了
It's too late for that, darlin'.

852
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,120
還有好多事也都來不及了
That and about a million other things.

853
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:57,980
你的錢
Your money.

854
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:01,930
不是我的
That's not mine.
