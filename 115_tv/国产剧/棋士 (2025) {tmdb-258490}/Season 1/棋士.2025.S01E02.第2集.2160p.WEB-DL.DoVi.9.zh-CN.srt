1
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,600
他们终于要来抓走这些巫师了
They have come for the witches at last!

2
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,480
在我们来这里之前
Before we came here,

3
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,860
我们本来有机会把巫师交出去
we had a chance to give the witches up,

4
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,190
但他们用巫术迷惑了你们
but they enchanted you all.

5
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,580
现在是你们悔过的机会
Now is your moment to repent.

6
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,570
把他们从我们身边赶走
Let us rid ourselves of them!

7
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,540
我们如今面临的危险  都要怪他们
They are the ones to blame for the danger we are facing today,

8
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,880
他们必须为此受到惩罚
and they must answer for it!

9
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,550
众所周知
Everyone knows

10
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:23,710
一直以来你们才是我们真正的敌人
that you have been our true enemy this whole time!

11
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,790
拦住他们  别让他们跑了
Hold them! Don't let them go!

12
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,420
不要让他们离开
Do not let them leave!

13
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,350
我们要用他们作为筹码来换取活命的机会
We will use them as a bargain for our lives.

14
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,310
我制住他了  我制住他了
I have him! I have him!

15
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,290
退后
Stand back!

16
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,470
巫师用刀抵着我的喉咙
The witch has me by the throat!

17
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,690
我们必须马上离开
We have to leave now.

18
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,390
带他们去河边  去河边
Get them to the river. To the river.

19
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,940
-让恶魔们走  -阿尔卡
- Let the devils pass! - Arca!

20
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,520
我们很快就能除掉他们
We'll be rid of them soon enough!

21
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:45,980
玛特尔
Matal!

22
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,440
快走
Go.

23
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,200
跟他们一起走  活下去
Go with them. Live.

24
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,280
我爱你
I love you.

25
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,590
玛特尔
Matal.

26
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:16,890
她干什么
What is she doing?

27
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,390
博
Bow?

28
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,220
我要跟你们一起走
I'm coming with you.

29
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,850
跟我走  快跟上
Come with me! Follow!

30
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:25,640
可风
Kofun.

31
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,770
我对你没有用处
You have no use for me.

32
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,570
放我走吧
Let me go.

33
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,650
他应该死
He deserves to die.

34
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,400
不
No.

35
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,710
如果我真的是恶魔  我会很乐意杀了你
If I were a devil for real, I would take great pleasure.

36
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,800
但我们不是那种部落
But we're not that kind of tribe.

37
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,480
我是塔玛奇俊
I am Tamacti Jun.

38
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,410
凯恩女王麾下的猎巫将军
Witchfinder General for Queen Kane

39
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,290
也是帕岩的神圣守护者
and the Holy Guardians of the Payan.

40
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:06,700
猎巫者大人  您终于来救我们了
At last, Witchfinder, you have come to save us.

41
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,910
跪下
On your knees.

42
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,460
什么
What?

43
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,040
所有人都跪下
All of you.

44
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,230
要想活命
For your lives...

45
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,360
把杰拉马瑞尔的孩子交出来
give up the children of Jerlamarel.

46
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,940
我们艾肯尼人是良善之人
We Alkenny are good people.

47
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,780
安分守己
Quiet people.

48
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,990
求您了
Please...

49
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,950
猎巫者大人  求您了
Witchfinder, please.

50
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,670
巫师们都已经走了
The witches are gone.

51
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,380
在被证明不是前
Until proven otherwise...

52
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,640
你们都是巫师
you're all witches.

53
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,430
神圣守护者
Holy Guardian!

54
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,810
我是盖瑟拜克斯
This is Gether Bax!

55
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,810
那些巫师都逃走了
The witches, they've run!

56
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,810
请跟我来
Follow me!

57
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,280
等等  这是条死路
Wait. It's a dead end.

58
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,870
不  孩子  我们从这里下去
No, my boy. This is where we descend.

59
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,870
快看
Look.

60
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,340
爸
Dad.

61
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,170
这是你做的吗  就你一个人
You did this? Alone?

62
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,140
杰拉马瑞尔能做到的  我也可以  只是做得更大
Anything Jerlamarel can do, I can do, only bigger.

63
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,180
是什么东西  我们下面有什么
What is it? What's below us?

64
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,890
是自由  妈妈
Freedom, Mama.

65
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,640
爸爸造了条船
Dad built a boat.

66
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,360
儿子
Son.

67
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,150
你是什么时候造的这个船
When did you do this?

68
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,900
一有时间就来弄
When I could.

69
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,750
你会很惊讶在你每天早上睁眼前
You'd be surprised how much you can accomplish

70
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,740
就能完成多少事
before your eyes even get open in the morning.

71
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,910
为什么
Why?

72
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,000
跟你们一样  我也希望这一天永远不会到来
Like you, I hoped this day would never come.

73
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,460
但你已经提前做好了准备
But you prepared for it?

74
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,790
是的  没错
Yes, I did.

75
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,250
因为这个准备  我们将能活着见到明天的太阳
And because of it, we will live to see tomorrow.

76
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,090
逃走的那些人里...
The ones that fled...

77
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,010
其中有一个是建造师吗
was one of them a builder?

78
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,090
是的  而且技术非常高超
Yes. Yes, a very skilled one.

79
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,140
过河
Cross.

80
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,130
-爸  -我知道  我能听见
- Dad. - Shh. I know. I can hear them.

81
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,710
把我的剑给我
Give me my sword.

82
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,290
他们就在前方  两岸都有
They are ahead. Both sides.

83
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,460
我们无声地穿过去
We travel silently.

84
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,220
我们无声地穿过去
We travel silently.

85
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,790
我一直在寻找你...
I have been looking for you...

86
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,540
找了一辈子了
for a lifetime.

87
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,760
你出生的时候  我也在
I was there when you were born.

88
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:02,230
我听到过你最初的啼哭
I heard your first cries.

89
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,400
从那以后
And ever since,

90
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,900
我倾尽一生  试图再次寻找到你
I have devoted my life to finding you again.

91
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:21,500
我杀了那么多人  才终于找到你
I have laid waste to so many lives to reach you.

92
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,790
现在...
And now...

93
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,670
接下来要怎样
what next?

94
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,180
附近  有一个全是你们同族的村子
Nearby, there's a village filled with your kinsmen

95
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:38,350
都跪在地上  乞求我的宽恕
all on their knees begging for my forgiveness.

96
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,890
或许你可以换回他们一条命
Perhaps you can purchase it for them.

97
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,730
说话
Speak.

98
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,040
让我听听你的声音
Let me hear the sound of your voices

99
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,570
自你出生时的啼哭之后  我可再没听到过了
for the first time since they were newborn wails.

100
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,120
自报身份吧
Announce yourselves.

101
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:07,580
让我护送你去见你的女王
And let me escort you to meet your queen.

102
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,050
照做的话
Do it...

103
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,220
村民们就能活下来
and the village lives.

104
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,270
不配合是吗
No?

105
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,560
救命啊
Help!

106
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,770
不要
No!

107
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,620
-巴巴  -玛格拉
- Baba! - Maghra.

108
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:23,930
等等  妈妈
Wait, Mama.

109
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:40,360
不要
No!

110
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,570
妈妈
Mom!

111
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,140
快走
Go!

112
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,350
阿尔卡
Arca!

113
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,590
下流有什么
What lies downriver?

114
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,640
我们能继续追吗
Can we pursue?

115
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,470
我被刺穿了
I've been run through.

116
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,310
前方有什么
What lies ahead?

117
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:00,270
或许能饶你一命
Perhaps you can be saved.

118
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:03,150
宽阔的水域  都是深水区
Open waters, deep water.

119
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,070
他们会漂得很快
They'll move quickly.

120
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,030
你肯定追不上他们
You will not be able to catch them.

121
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,630
救救我
Help me.

122
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,630
好了  这样应该能给你节省点时间
There. That should save you some time.

123
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,170
回村庄去  把他们全杀光
Return to the village. Kill them all.

124
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,040
信使
Herald.

125
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,530
传消息给凯恩女王
Message for Queen Kane.

126
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,660
就说巫师们逃走了
The witches have escaped.

127
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,090
塔玛奇俊传消息回来了
Tamacti Jun sends news.

128
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,680
他找到那些巫师了吗
Did he locate the witches?

129
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,610
是的  但他们暂时逃走了
Yes. But, for the moment, they escaped him.

130
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,100
他们又从他手中逃脱了吗
They escaped him again?

131
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,780
-怎么逃的  -他没说
- How? - He doesn't say.

132
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:02,720
那我们只能猜测或臆想了
So we must guess, or invent for ourselves.

133
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,810
安夫人
Lady An,

134
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,010
当神之火焰灼烧我们时
when the God Flame burns our skin,

135
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,380
你会怪罪神还是你自己
do you blame God or yourself?

136
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,040
都不会怪  女王陛下
Neither one, my queen.

137
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:16,790
我会怪我的女仆没有给我遮挡
I blame my maid for not shading me.

138
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:21,280
永远不能怪罪神  没人怪罪您
Gods are not blamed. No one is blaming you.

139
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:26,260
但这个消息或许意味着塔玛奇俊该回来了
But perhaps this news means Tamacti Jun should return home.

140
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,040
不不不
No. No, no, no.

141
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,470
但要承担追捕任务
But to undertake such a journey,

142
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,770
塔玛奇俊需要更多的士兵
Tamacti Jun will need more soldiers.

143
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,030
陛下  求您了...
Majesty, please--

144
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,000
再多派些去  全部派过去
Send more. Send all of them.

145
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,170
他们是父亲和母亲
These are fathers and mothers,

146
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,950
丈夫和妻子
husbands and wives,

147
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,130
女儿和儿子
daughters and sons.

148
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:46,540
他们的家人承受了他们缺席的苦楚
Their families have suffered their absences.

149
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:50,750
他们已经厌倦了这种  没有结果的远征
They are tired of this... fruitless crusade.

150
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,000
他们无法理解
It's beyond their understanding.

151
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:57,140
神圣机器也不堪重负  陛下
The holy machines are groaning too, Your Majesty.

152
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,270
众神自身也无法理解
The gods themselves do not understand this.

153
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,820
难道你还能听懂众神说的话了不成
But you understand what the gods are saying?

154
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,570
是的  他们在说"够了"
Yes! They are saying "Enough!"

155
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,810
够了
Enough!

156
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,050
瞧啊
There...

157
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,550
我们的古代《宪法》里规定了
in our ancient constitution.

158
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,110
"君王将统领议会
"And the monarch shall rule the parliament,

159
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,840
至死方休"
and the monarch shall rule until death."

160
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,410
我没感觉不适
I'm not feeling unwell.

161
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:36,030
陛下  帕岩人民都这么说
Majesty, here is what the people of Payan say.

162
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,550
你不过是把他们当祈祷垫践踏
As you fuck them like prayer mats.

163
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:42,920
事情摆在眼前  您花了二三十年时间追捕巫师
Plainly, simply, you have chased the witches for a generation.

164
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,780
却未曾寻到过一个
Yet none has been found.

165
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,340
您牺牲了我们的军队
You have sacrificed our army,

166
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,820
掏空了我们的宝库
emptied our treasure houses.

167
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:54,450
仍然无法证明有邪恶力量存在
Still there is no proof of evil power.

168
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,140
只有...
Just...

169
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,340
一个您爱过的男人离开了您
a man you once loved who ran away from you.

170
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:09,790
人民都说我们是一个
They say we are a nation governed

171
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,390
被破碎之心统治的国度
by a broken heart.

172
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,390
这是杰拉马瑞尔留下的信息
A message from Jerlamarel.

173
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,850
等孩子们准备好抛下我们时
A message to present to the children

174
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,910
就转交给他们
once they were ready to leave us behind.

175
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,530
是用眼睛才能看到的信息
It is a message for eyes.

176
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,200
杰拉马瑞尔还留下更多"惊喜"
More surprises from Jerlamarel?

177
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,860
我向他保证过
I gave him my word.

178
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,890
我会等到他们完全准备好  才交给他们
I would present it no sooner than when they were ready for it.

179
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,480
这是他给我的最后一条信息
It's the last of my messages from him.

180
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:06,780
我对他最后的承诺
Last of my promises to him.

181
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,200
确定吗
Are we sure?

182
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,500
确定
Yes, we are.

183
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,780
念吧
Go ahead.

184
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,660
"我亲爱的孩子们
"My dear children...

185
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,530
河流只是开始
the river is the beginning.

186
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,040
你们回到我身边的漫长旅途的第一步
The first step of your long journey back to me.

187
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,030
沿着河流到薰衣草地
Follow the river to the lavender.

188
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,500
薰衣草大道"
The great lavender road."

189
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,900
薰衣草大道是真实存在的
The lavender road is real.

190
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:44,720
"然后沿着薰衣草大道走到觉悟大宅
"Then follow the lavender road to the House of Enlightenment.

191
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:49,220
我将在那里建立新王国
There, I will build a new kingdom.

192
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,680
成为这阴暗世界里的一道耀眼光芒
A bright shining light in a world of darkness.

193
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,300
有一天  你们将来到我身边  知我所知
And one day, you will come to me and know what I know.

194
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,010
并将这知识
And carry this knowledge

195
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:01,080
传递到地球最黑暗的角落"
forward to the darkest corners of the earth."

196
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,710
-"有眼能视之人必须跟随我"  -"...必须跟随我"
- "Those with eyes to see must follow me." - "...see must follow me."

197
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:14,720
所以我们就沿着河前进吗  要走多远
So, what? We just follow the river? For how long?

198
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,660
他会留下标记给我们
He'll leave us signs.

199
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,660
-我们能到达目的地  -真的吗
- We'll make it. - Will we?

200
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,370
我们还有别的选择吗
What other choice do we have?

201
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,190
我们有选择
We have a choice.

202
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:30,520
听我说
Listen to me.

203
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,080
看着我
Look at me.

204
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,560
旅途越长
The longer the journey,

205
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:51,530
其挑战越巨大
the more profound its challenges,

206
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:55,480
对行走者的影响也越深远
the more it changes all who endure it.

207
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,830
像这样的旅途
A journey like this one...

208
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,050
我们之中能活下来的人
Those of us who could survive it,

209
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,730
我担心在路途结束后
I fear, would emerge on the other end of it

210
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,920
会变得面目全非
unrecognizable to each other.

211
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:30,170
如果我们变得连自己都不认识自己了
What kind of answers will the House of Enlightenment provide

212
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:34,390
觉悟大宅又会给我们何种答案
to any of us if we no longer recognize ourselves?

213
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:44,450
无论投票结果如何  我都会遵守
I will abide to whatever our vote decides,

214
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,230
但你们得听好了
but you must hear this.

215
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:52,830
我们可以选择继续过现在的生活
We have a choice to live as we are.

216
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,780
我们可以和猎巫者拉开些距离
We can gain some distance on the Witchfinder,

217
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:58,120
但此时他一定正继续追捕我们
who most certainly continues his pursuit as we speak.

218
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:03,040
我们能迁移到远离他势力范围的天涯海角
And we can move far away from anywhere he might track us...

219
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:09,700
过着简单  宁静的生活
and live our lives simply, and quietly,

220
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,600
永不分离
and together.

221
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,520
妈妈
Mama,

222
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:26,510
我不知道我能否认识到真实的自己
I don't know that I can ever know who I really am

223
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,990
除非我知道我的出身
until I know where I came from.

224
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:36,660
而想确定这一点  就必须找到杰拉马瑞尔
And I can't know that until I know Jerlamarel.

225
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,770
你呢
And you?

226
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:51,360
我不认为自己注定是个躲避世界的人
I don't think I'm meant to be someone who hides from the world.

227
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,870
我不认为我想当一个无视真相的人
I don't think I want to be someone who ignores the truth

228
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:57,220
就因为我害怕真相也许残忍
because I'm afraid of what it might mean.

229
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,660
我知道了
I see.

230
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,670
我们开始投票吗
Shall we take the vote?

231
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,820
支持离开河流去找庇护所的人请投票
All those in favor of leaving the river and finding shelter.

232
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,620
支持跟随杰拉马瑞尔脚步的人请投票
All those in favor of following the trail of Jerlamarel.

233
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:33,280
还有一个人未投票
There's still one vote left to be cast.

234
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:40,180
-不  -我们是一个部族  哈妮瓦
- No. - We are one tribe, Haniwa.

235
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,910
我们才是一个部族
We are one tribe.

236
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:43,860
我们
We.

237
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:47,570
从一开始就一起经历了一切的人
The ones who have been in this together from the beginning.

238
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,460
我同意帕丽丝
I agree with Paris.

239
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,210
现在我们是仅存的艾肯尼人
Right now we are all that remain of the Alkenny,

240
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,430
博莱昂也是
and Bow Lion shares that connection.

241
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,090
艾肯尼人为了自保  宁愿把我们
The Alkenny were willing to hand us over to the Witchfinder

242
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,990
交给猎巫者
in order to save themselves.

243
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,050
他们只是做了该做的事
They did what they did.

244
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,810
但他们也教导了你  喂养了你
But they also taught you, they fed you,

245
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,020
爱护你  他们是你的朋友
they loved you, and befriended you.

246
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,870
为了救你们  他们被迫离乡背井
They uprooted their lives to save yours.

247
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:13,720
但是一有机会  他们就背叛了我们
And the very first chance they got, they betrayed us all.

248
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:17,670
小船上就我们六个人  大家都有权发言
There are six of us on this boat, and everyone will be heard.

249
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,380
不
No.

250
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,890
她和这件事毫无关系
She has absolutely nothing to do with this.

251
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,070
哈妮瓦
Haniwa.

252
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,580
我提议顺着河走
I vote to follow the river.

253
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,660
我赞同哈妮瓦和可风
I vote with Haniwa and Kofun.

254
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,910
阿尔卡  玛特尔和我母亲
Arca, Matal, my mother...

255
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:44,360
我们已经牺牲了太多  现在只能继续前进
We've sacrificed too much to stop now.

256
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,480
那我们就决定了
Then we have decided.

257
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,220
将军
General!

258
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,000
报告
Report.

259
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,740
有好消息  将军
Good news, General.

260
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,970
我们认为前方地形危险  但也许可以通过
We believe the terrain ahead is treacherous but may be passable.

261
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,100
在我们侦察的时候
The column needn't be camped

262
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,340
纵队不必驻扎超过半天
for more than a half day while we scout it out.

263
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,530
除非我们都死了或是找到杰拉马瑞尔的孩子
No one's stopping until either we're all dead

264
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,480
否则谁也不准停下  明白吗
or we find the children of Jerlamarel. Understood?

265
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,050
-明白  -很好
- Understood. - Good.

266
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,010
那就继续走
So move!

267
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,300
那就必须杀了女王
Then it must be done to kill the queen.

268
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,140
神吗
A god?

269
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,810
这里还有谁相信这个
Who here still believes that?

270
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,790
我们相信什么并不重要
What we believe is not important.

271
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,240
但下层城墙的许多人还相信这一点
Many of the people of the lower walls still believe it.

272
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,450
-如果我们罢黜  -罢黜他们的神
- If we deposed-- - Deposed their god,

273
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,180
他们会崛起叛变
they would rise up.

274
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,320
-我们有士兵  -如此之少
- We have soldiers. - So few.

275
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,100
那我们就不能亲手罢黜她
Then we must not be the ones to depose her.

276
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,830
如果连我们都害怕去做  还有谁会去做
If even we fear to do it, who else possibly would?

277
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,270
要杀神  就必须向神寻求帮助
To kill a god, one must enlist a god.

278
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:59,280
她的死不能有挣扎的痕迹
Her death must involve no struggle,

279
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,310
不能流血  不能用武器
no blood, no weapon.

280
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,930
不能有人为证据
No evidence of human hand whatsoever.

281
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,830
这样下层城墙的人
And then the people from the lower wall

282
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,260
将会听到他们的女王
will hear that their queen

283
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:12,970
是因为神出手干预而身亡
was struck down by divine intervention.

284
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:18,160
他们会说  "此乃正义之举"
And they will say, "This is justice."

285
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,040
我太仁慈了
I'm too merciful.

286
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,200
我们可以祈祷
We could pray.

287
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,710
我祈祷只为得到真相
I pray only for the truth.

288
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,330
你听到了什么
What do you hear?

289
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,650
有一些关于你的新传闻
There are new whispers about you.

290
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:06,300
是谁在传  安夫人  还是杜恩大人
Who whispers? Lady An? Lord Dune?

291
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,530
除了他们  还有其他人
Yes, and others.

292
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,990
把名字告诉我
Give me names.

293
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,390
他们全部人  女王陛下
All of them, my queen.

294
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,470
-你为什么这么做  -做什么
- Why did you do that? - Do what?

295
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,370
你没有理由去我们要去的地方
You have no reason to go where we're going.

296
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,780
如果你反对我们  你就不必去
If you voted against us, you wouldn't have to.

297
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:06,910
他们都死了
They're gone.

298
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,470
所有人都死了
Everyone's gone.

299
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,880
我还能去哪里
Where else am I gonna go?

300
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,330
但你还是选择了更艰难的一条路
Still. Still you chose the harder path.

301
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:25,300
更危险的一条路  但是为什么呢
The more dangerous one. But why?

302
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,750
我不了解你和你妹妹
I don't know you and your sister very well.

303
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,210
我更了解村子里的其他人
Not like I knew the others in the village.

304
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:37,150
因为只有我们  你无法监视
Because we were the only ones you couldn't spy on.

305
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,460
我知道你是暗影
I know you're a shadow.

306
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,590
我也许不知道你所有的秘密
I may not know all your secrets...

307
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,650
但是大家一直都知道你妹妹的怒火
but your sister's anger has never been a secret to anyone.

308
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,720
我同意走这条路  是因为...
I voted that way because...

309
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,470
我不知道这有什么区别
I don't know what difference it makes,

310
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:58,030
今天我不想再争执了
and I'm done fighting for today.

311
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,980
她没有生气
She-She isn't angry.

312
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:05,540
她没有生你的气
I mean, she isn't angry with you.

313
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:12,330
这些对她来说难以接受  她尽力了
Look, this is just a lot for her, and she's trying her best.

314
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,120
有时这表现为愤怒
And sometimes that comes out as anger.

315
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,490
对你来说也难以接受吧
Isn't it hard for you too?

316
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:37,100
谢谢你和我说话
Thank you for trying to speak to me.

317
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,650
我现在想一个人静静
I'd like to be alone now.

318
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,360
需要帮忙吗
Hey, do you need help?

319
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,400
需要  我做了这些
Yes. I made these.

320
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:02,010
-是给博的  -好
- To give to Bow. - Okay.

321
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,650
这个给你和哈妮瓦
For you and Haniwa.

322
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,710
我们今晚要停下过夜
We need to stop for the night.

323
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,910
她需要在篝火边休息
She needs to rest by a fire.

324
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,120
好
Yes.

325
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,260
你没事吧
Are you all right?

326
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,310
她从来没这样跟我说过话
She's never spoken to me that way before.

327
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,230
和我争执  没错
Argued with me, yes.

328
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:37,190
多次违抗我  但
Defied me many times, but...

329
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,110
但这次太不同寻常
this was just something so different.

330
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:51,660
如果投票结果是平局  而我打破了平局
If the vote had been a tie and I'd broken that tie against her,

331
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,160
我真不知道她会做什么
I honestly don't know what she would have done.

332
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,750
我们告诉他们要终身隐藏自己身份
We told them to hide who they were their whole lives.

333
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:08,380
告诉他们任何人知道都不安全
Told them it wasn't safe for anyone to know.

334
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:15,390
我们从来都不知道他们应该成为谁
We never really knew who they were supposed to be.

335
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,390
他们又怎么能知道
How could they?

336
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:24,230
也许我们越往河深处走
Maybe the further up this river we go...

337
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:28,200
他们越容易发现自我
the freer they'll be to find out.

338
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:31,410
不是吗
Hmm?

339
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:05,940
女王陛下
Your Majesty?

340
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:09,740
您的侍女送来了我的请柬
Your handmaiden delivered my invitation?

341
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,450
的确是的  安夫人  她的确送了
Indeed, she did, Lady An. Indeed, she did.

342
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:15,370
女王陛下  欢迎
Your Majesty, welcome.

343
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:32,300
性的气息和鸣禽的声音
The smell of sex and the sound of songbirds.

344
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,390
神圣的组合
The divine combination.

345
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:36,390
正如我在请柬中告诉您
And as I told you in my invitation,

346
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:39,230
我为您准备了一件特别的欢愉之事
I have a special pleasure in store for you.

347
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:44,400
没被邀请的人  现在离开
Everyone not invited, leave now.

348
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:56,490
一首新歌  一只新鸟
A new song. A new bird.

349
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,290
您将成为第一个在宫墙内听到它的人
You will be the first to hear it inside the palace walls.

350
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,580
谁会留下来分享我的喜悦呢
And who will stay to share my delight?

351
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,920
是我  陛下
It is I, Your Majesty.

352
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:10,170
如果您允许的话
With your permission.

353
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,180
当然  杜恩大人  我知道会是你
Oh, of course, Lord Dune. I know it'd be you.

354
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:16,890
我们认为那只奇怪的新鸟
We think the strange new bird

355
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,520
被暴风雨吹离了路线
has been blown off course by a storm.

356
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:22,560
我的渔网工人听到它
My net man heard it singing

357
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,610
在苹果树上唱歌  就设法捉住了它
in the apple trees and managed to trap it.

358
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,900
那他将得到奖赏
Well, then that man will be rewarded.

359
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:30,680
你也一样  安夫人
As will you, Lady An.

360
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,450
还有你  杜恩大人  谢谢你们想着我
And you, Lord Dune, for thinking of me.

361
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:35,200
这是我们的新客人
And here is our new guest.

362
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,170
我没听见歌曲
I don't hear a song.

363
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,630
我听说这种鸟
I'm told this particular bird

364
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:53,170
只有被拿在手里时才会唱歌
only sings when you take it in your hand.

365
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:57,180
您将是第一个把它拿在手里的人
Yours will be the first hand to hold it.

366
00:36:59,220 --> 00:36:59,970
那么
Well...

367
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:03,680
打开笼子的门  杜恩大人
then open the door of the cage, Lord Dune.

368
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,400
鸟通常会在人群前战栗
Birds usually tremble among people.

369
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,660
我没听见它战栗抖动的声音
I don't hear it tremble.

370
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,620
也许它不害怕
Perhaps it's not afraid.

371
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,220
而我也不害怕
And I am not afraid.

372
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:38,430
你看  我的整个议会都同意我死
You see, my whole entire parliament agreeing to my death,

373
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,600
整个堕落的城市都希望我死
this whole rotten city wanting me to die.

374
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,680
我决定不为这座城市而死
I've decided I won't die for this city.

375
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,520
这个城市会为我而死
This city will die for me.

376
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:50,190
你先死吧
You can go first.

377
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,790
好了
Okay.

378
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:16,800
我们已经走了很远了
We've traveled a good distance.

379
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:20,720
只要我们在天亮前继续前进  我们应该没事
As long as we keep moving by daybreak, we should be fine.

380
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,470
我们中有一个人要守夜
One of us should stay awake through the night

381
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:24,850
保持警惕并且持续生火
to keep watch and tend the fire.

382
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,480
跟我坐一起
Sit with me.

383
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,540
妈妈
Mama...

384
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:50,880
告诉我  你觉得会是什么样子
Tell me. What do you imagine it will be like?

385
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,340
什么会是什么样子
What will what be like?

386
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,800
他说  "我将在那里建立新王国"
"There, I'll build my kingdom," he says.

387
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:09,560
我们都要冒着生命危险去这个地方
We're all gonna risk life and limb to get to this place.

388
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:11,310
那告诉我
So, tell me.

389
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,610
你想象这个王国会是什么样子
What do you imagine this kingdom will be like?

390
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,280
这个嘛
Well...

391
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:30,540
我想
I imagine...

392
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,130
它会是
it will be...

393
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,670
一个能让我们记住事情的地方
a place where we'll remember things.

394
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:43,010
关于我们曾经的生活
About what things were like for us once.

395
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,850
关于我们以前的样子
About who we used to be.

396
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,350
关于
About...

397
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:55,310
如何利用这些知识让生活变得更好
how to use that knowledge to make things better now.

398
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,650
我想
I imagine...

399
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,370
在那里
it will be a place where...

400
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,700
我不再是另类
I won't be the strange one anymore.

401
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:14,420
我可以帮助建设重要的东西
Where I can help to build something important...

402
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:18,000
而且我不需要隐藏自己的身份
and do it without having to hide who I am.

403
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:23,380
如果你父亲为自己建立了一个王国
If your father builds himself a kingdom,

404
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,140
你就是公主了
you would be its princess.

405
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,230
不是那样的
It's not like that.

406
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:35,230
我愿意做他吩咐的一切  只要我能帮忙
I would do whatever he asked me to do. However I could help.

407
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:37,570
在这个王国里我是谁
And who would I be in this kingdom?

408
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,860
你是王后
You'd be its queen.

409
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:46,780
我不这么认为
I don't think so.

410
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,330
有视觉的国王
A king with vision...

411
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:54,330
有视觉的王子和公主
a prince and princess with vision.

412
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,340
而我却看不见
I'd be the one without.

413
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,630
我将会是异类
I'll be the strange one.

414
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:05,220
人们口中的弱者
The one they say is weak.

415
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,470
我不会让任何人这么说
I would never let anyone say that.

416
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,100
我知道你不会
I know you wouldn't.

417
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:18,360
我必须要去这个地方  这很重要
It is important for me to reach this place.

418
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,230
但这不是关乎我
But it's not about me.

419
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,070
而是关乎我们大家
It's about all of us.

420
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:29,950
我们在那能生活地更好  我真的这么觉得
We'll all be better off there. I really believe that.

421
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,340
我们都该休息一会儿
We should all rest a while.

422
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,220
好的
Okay.

423
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:32,860
可风  我的剑不见了
Kofun, my sword is missing.

424
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:34,370
我的弓也没了
My bow's gone, too.

425
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,580
-玛格拉  -博  检查船
- Maghra. - Bow, check the boat.

426
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,370
-我以为你们有一人整晚醒着  -来吧
- I thought one of you was awake all night. - Come.

427
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:41,330
-是的  -来吧
- We were. - Come.

428
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,040
那怎么会这样
Then how did this happen?

429
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:45,840
有人走过了我们的营地  没有吵醒我们
Someone walked all through our camp, woke none of us,

430
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,170
-也没有被你俩看到  -我不知道
- and was seen by neither of you? - I don't know.

431
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,880
全都没了  是不是
It's all gone now, isn't it?

432
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:54,430
-帮帮我  我们得走了  -好  走吧
- Help me. We need to go. - Okay. Now walk.

433
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:55,550
我们不能离开
We can't leave.

434
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:56,930
我们必须走
We must.

435
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:01,480
被拿走的都是武器  没有可替代的东西
All that was taken was weapons. It's nothing irreplaceable.

436
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,350
-我有东西不见了  -来吧
- I'm missing something. - Come.

437
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:05,150
你丢什么了
What are you missing?

438
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:09,650
一个小袋子  很软  跟拳头一样大
It's a small pouch. It's soft. Size of a fist.

439
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:10,610
袋子里有什么
What is in the pouch?

440
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:12,400
对我来说很重要的东西
Something very important to me.

441
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:14,820
我父亲留给我的唯一东西
The only thing I have left of my father.

442
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:17,160
-我与他的唯一联系  是...  -好吧
- My only connection to him. It's... - Okay.

443
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,700
这无可替代  我们必须找到
It's irreplaceable! We have to find out where it went.

444
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,000
我们必须找回来
We have to get it back.

445
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,750
-但妈妈  里面是什么  -很重要的东西
- But, Mom, what is it? - It's important.

446
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:26,840
玛格拉  听着
Maghra, listen--

447
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,300
你能不能...
Please can you just--

448
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:31,720
别让我再多解释了  就帮我找到
Don't ask me to say anything more. Just help me find it.

449
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:35,970
亲爱的  我们没有武器
My love, we are unarmed.

450
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,510
昨晚无论谁来过  都可能返回
Whoever came last night may return.

451
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,060
而且猎巫者在外面游荡找寻
And the Witchfinder lurks out there somewhere.

452
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,730
如果我们待得太久  他会找到我们
If we remain too long, he will find us.

453
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:45,600
那我们得赶紧了
Then we must hurry.

454
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,400
我的父亲  我和他的关系
My father, my relationship with him

455
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,690
我不知道如何开口阐述
is not something I know how to talk about.

456
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,030
很复杂
It's complicated.

457
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:55,740
我觉得你应该最能理解这点
And, of all people, I would think you would understand.

458
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:06,020
无论我向你隐瞒了什么
Whatever secrets I have kept from you

459
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,840
这秘密都一直保护了我们
has been to protect us.

460
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:10,050
无论你向我隐瞒了什么
Whatever secrets you have kept from me

461
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:11,710
这秘密也一直保护了我们
has always been to protect us.

462
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:14,970
拜托让我理解一下
Please help me understand this.

463
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,390
告诉我为什么要现在
Help me justify putting our children

464
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:20,060
置我们的孩子于险境  因为我做不到
in danger right now because I cannot.

465
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,520
我知道
I know.

466
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:27,690
里面有什么这么重要  你连说都不能说
What could possibly be so important and still you'll not say it?

467
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,730
-我去找  -不行
- I'll do it. - No.

468
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:32,650
哈妮瓦
Haniwa.

469
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,360
她已经知道你的诉求了
She already knows everything you're asking.

470
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:37,450
我会替你找到
I'll find it for you.

471
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:40,910
如果是江匪  他们离我们半日的路程
If it were river bandits, they're half a day away.

472
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:42,790
如果是奥派罗族  可能有上百人
If it was the Opayol, there could be hundreds of them.

473
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:44,540
上百个看不见我的人
A hundred of them won't see me coming.

474
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:47,120
你知道我们逃脱猎巫者的追捕有多幸运吗
Do you know how fortunate we were to escape the Witchfinder?

475
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,170
非常幸运
Very fortunate.

476
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:51,750
又一次没有武器的打斗吗
Another fight and now without arms?

477
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:54,050
我不是说要进行打斗  爸爸
I'm not suggesting we get into a fight, Papa.

478
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:56,260
无论是谁拿的
Whoever took it...

479
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,970
如果他们不知道我在那  又怎么跟我打斗
how can they fight me if they don't even know that I'm there?

480
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,600
再说  我们都不知道他们是谁
And besides, we don't know who they are.

481
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:02,760
我们应该至少搞清楚
We should at least try to figure out--

482
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:03,970
我想我知道
I think I know.

483
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:09,560
-什么  -我想我知道是谁拿了我们的东西
- What? - I think I know who took our things.

484
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:13,780
-你在说什么  -你看
- What are you talking about? - Look, please.

485
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,370
是什么  你们看到什么了
What is it? What do you see?

486
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:35,630
告诉我  是什么
Tell me. What is it?

487
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:40,180
告诉我
Tell me.

488
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,780
到时候了  女王陛下
It is time, my queen.

489
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,530
安夫人所说的话已传开
News of Lady An's parlor has spread.

490
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:00,030
集体示威的人群
Demonstrations in protest of you

491
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:01,780
抗议您杀害了好几个受尊敬的大人
having killed several beloved lords

492
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,490
从下层城墙开始涌动
have begun about the lower wall.

493
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,410
宫殿卫兵将他们堵在了海湾处
The palace guard keeps them at bay,

494
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:07,200
但我不知道能维持多久
but for how long I do not know.

495
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:15,460
女王陛下
My queen?

496
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:20,180
接下去会怎样
What happens next?

497
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:23,970
剩余的大人集合到了一起
The remaining lords are convening.

498
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:25,760
如果他们取得了暴徒的信任
If they gain the trust of the mob,

499
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:27,470
说不好他们会怎么做
there's no telling what they may do.

500
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:50,430
父啊  您的大能我们能感知  却触摸不到
Father, whose power we feel but cannot touch...

501
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:55,560
我接受我的命运
I accept my fate.

502
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:59,270
我感谢您能让我选择生死时辰
I thank you that I could choose its hour.

503
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:02,190
杰拉马瑞尔  你没有来找我  我的爱人
Jerlamarel, you did not come for me, my love.

504
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:05,070
所以我来找你了
So I am coming to you.
