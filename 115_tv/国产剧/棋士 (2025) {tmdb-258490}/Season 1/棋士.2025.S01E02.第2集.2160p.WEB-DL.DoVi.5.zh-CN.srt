1
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,030
谁在那里  回答我  谁在那里
Who's there? Answer me. Who's there?

2
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,990
看来我的孩子受到了很好的照顾
I see my children are in good hands.

3
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,710
杰拉马瑞尔  是你吗
Jerlamarel... is that you?

4
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:41,880
是我
Yes.

5
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,020
你是来带他们走的吗
Did you come to take them away?

6
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,600
不  我是个逃亡者
No. I'm a fugitive.

7
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,140
我在别处还有事要干
And I have work to do elsewhere.

8
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,610
他们还是在你身边成长更安全
They are safer with you as they grow.

9
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,780
我跟着只是为了保证你们能找到庇护所
I stayed close to make sure that you would find the sanctuary.

10
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,910
并在山谷里杀熊
And to kill the bears in the valley.

11
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,700
我相信这应该是最后一只熊了
I believe this is the last bear.

12
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,710
这些孩子真是礼物
These children are a gift.

13
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,090
一定要好好照顾他们成长
Take great care of them as they grow.

14
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,300
可以把手给我吗
May I have your hand?

15
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,060
这  这是什么
What is... what is this?

16
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,030
在庇护所的瀑布边上  有一个小洞穴
At the sanctuary, beside the waterfall, there is a small cave.

17
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,570
爬进去  你会找到一个箱子
Climb in it. There you will find a box.

18
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,070
我给了你打开箱子的钥匙
I've given you the key to open that box.

19
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,320
去和帕丽丝谈谈
Speak to Paris.

20
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,790
告诉她  箱子里的东西是为我的孩子们准备
Tell her that the contents of the box are for my children.

21
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,790
在他们十二岁的时候打开箱子
Open the box when they are 12 summers old.

22
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,870
那时他们已能够理解里面的内容
Old enough to understand what is inside.

23
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,380
里面是什么
What is inside?

24
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,920
知识
Knowledge.

25
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,760
可以开启新世界的知识
Knowledge that will begin a new world.

26
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,390
甚至比我们祖先的世界还要好
Better even than the world of our ancestors.

27
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,230
总有一天  我们会团聚
Someday, we will be together.

28
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,330
给他们起名哈妮瓦和可风
Name them Haniwa and Kofun.

29
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,580
这样他们来找我时  我就能认出来
That way I'll know them when they come to me.

30
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,130
他们什么时候会去找你
And when will they come to you?

31
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,710
答案全在箱子中
The answers are all in the box.

32
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,510
等等  杰拉马瑞尔
Wait. Jerlamarel.

33
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,720
杰拉马瑞尔
Jerlamarel!

34
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,600
杰拉马瑞尔
Jerlamarel.

35
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,810
杰拉马瑞尔
Jerlamarel!

36
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:26,340
我刚听见巴巴沃斯在喊那个巫师的名字
I just heard Baba Voss calling the witch's name.

37
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,810
这不让你心烦吗
Does this not bother you?

38
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,600
-这地方不讲法律吗  -这里无法可讲
- Is there no law in this place? - We are far away from the law here.

39
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,070
现在巴巴沃斯掌权  我们不敢冒犯他
Baba Voss is in charge now. We dare not offend him.

40
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,820
巴巴沃斯又不是法
Baba Voss is not the law.

41
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,790
神才是法
God is the law.

42
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,170
可能我们在这也无神可依吧
Perhaps we are far away from God here too.

43
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,660
就是巴巴沃斯
It was Baba Voss

44
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:56,370
还有帕丽丝下令把我的母亲
and it was Paris who condemned my mother...

45
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,800
你的亲姐妹  活活烧死
your own sister, to the bonfire.

46
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,840
为了什么
For what?

47
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:07,880
因为她质疑让他这样的男人
Because she questioned the wisdom of letting a man like him,

48
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,810
一个拒绝谈起过去的陌生人
a stranger, who would not speak of his past,

49
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,840
掌管这个村子吗
to be in charge of the village?

50
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,400
他们烧死她
They burned her

51
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,020
是因为怕她说出真相
because they feared she spoke the truth.

52
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:24,570
神不会忽略这些事
God doesn't lose sight of those things.

53
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,490
就算祂真的忽略了
And even if he did...

54
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,240
我绝对不会
I never will.

55
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,170
你去哪里了
Where have you been?

56
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,550
巴巴沃斯
Baba Voss?

57
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,430
发生什么了
What happened?

58
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,680
跟我说实话
Only the truth.

59
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,140
坐下  亲爱的
Sit down, my love.

60
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,430
为什么
Why?

61
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,560
因为杰拉马瑞尔来过了
Because Jerlamarel... happened.

62
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,780
它说我们会在折木的尽头找到她
It says we'll find her at the end of the fallen trunk.

63
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,460
我只听过传说
I've only ever heard stories.

64
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,520
我都不知道村子里
I didn't even know that we had a Shadow

65
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,730
有暗影生活在我们之中
living among us in the village.

66
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,680
所以才叫暗影  没人知道他们是谁
Oh, that's why Shadows are Shadows. No one knows who they are.

67
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,970
但是艾肯尼历来有一个暗影
But the Alkenny have always had a Shadow.

68
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,780
我在祭坛上给她留了一张字条
I left a note on the altar for her,

69
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,600
我再去的时候就不见了
and when I came back, it was gone.

70
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,230
她会来的
She will be here.

71
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,860
你要怎么知道它来了
And how will you know when it arrives?

72
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:14,230
我不知道  我从来没这样做过
I don't know. I've never done this before.

73
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:18,030
我猜她会让我们知道她来了
I presume she will make herself known to us.

74
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,620
你为什么一直说"她"
Why do you keep saying "she"?

75
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:24,120
因为暗影肯定是女人  男人太笨拙
Because Shadows are always women. Men are too clumsy.

76
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,830
那你觉得会是谁
So who do you think it is, then?

77
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,870
可能是每天都会和我们交谈的人
Somebody we probably talk to every day.

78
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,920
是个有能力隐藏身体的人
Somebody with the power to hide her body.

79
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:36,050
没人能同时在又不在
No one can both be and then not be all at once.

80
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,310
只有其他人动她才会动
She moves only when others move.

81
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,100
就连阿尤拉也听不见她
Even Ayuras can't hear her.

82
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,520
她心中无思  就连先知也感知不到她
She purges herself of thought. Even presages can't sense her.

83
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:49,270
她在另一个空间  无法察觉
She's in another place, undetectable.

84
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,650
就连狗都以为她们是石头
Even dogs think they're stone.

85
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,450
她来了
She is here.

86
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:05,830
暗影  你好
Shadow... I greet you.

87
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:17,140
暗影  我需要你跟踪一个人  村里的人
Shadow, I need you to shadow someone, someone in the village,

88
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,880
把你听到的一切都告诉我
and report everything you hear.

89
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,680
你不顺从的话  她不会回应
She will not respond unless you submit.

90
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,600
别动
Stand still!

91
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,610
暗影  你能满足我的请求吗
Shadow, will you do as I ask?

92
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,950
是同意的意思吗
Is that a yes?

93
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,870
两声是"是"  一声是"不"  对吗
Two for "yes," one for "no"? Yes?

94
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:53,170
暗影  那个人就是帕丽丝
Shadow, the person is Paris.

95
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,470
我们认为她是巫师  我们需要证据
We believe she is a witch. We need proof.

96
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,960
你能跟踪巫师吗
Can you shadow a witch?

97
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,180
暗影  你能跟踪巫师吗
Shadow, can you shadow a witch?

98
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,820
我们怎么报答你
And how shall we pay you?

99
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,080
暗影
Shadow?

100
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,090
他说"新世界"
"A new world," he said?

101
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,930
也许开启新世界后  旧的就会被毁掉
Perhaps in making a new world, the old will be destroyed.

102
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,180
只是个箱子而已  亲爱的
It's just a box, my love.

103
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,200
这是什么
What is it?

104
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,950
是给孩子的  也许是个玩具
It's for the children. Perhaps it is a toy.

105
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,040
不  这有寓意
No. It will have a meaning.

106
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:15,290
他做的所有事都有寓意
Everything he does has a meaning.

107
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,420
其中的深意我永远都参不透
Meaning of which I can never understand.

108
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,560
我擅长照顾人  不擅长理解人
I'm good for caring, not good for understanding.

109
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,230
巴巴沃斯  我肯定会选择能照顾我的男人
Baba Voss, I would always choose a man who can care of me

110
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,760
而不是能理解我的男人
over a man who understands me.

111
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,600
帕丽丝
Paris?

112
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,890
是我
Yes.

113
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,570
你丈夫请我来的
Your husband invited me.

114
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,520
杰拉马瑞尔亲口说我们必须和她商量
Jerlamarel himself said we must consult with her.

115
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,030
来  坐
Come, come.

116
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,080
箱子里还有什么
What else is in the box?

117
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:06,680
这条信息说  我们必须保持
This message says we must keep what is on top on top,

118
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,890
上下的顺序不能颠倒
and what is at the bottom on the bottom.

119
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:25,440
用树皮怎么打造一个新世界
How do we make a new world of tree bark?

120
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:30,030
微风也无法带来视觉
The breeze brings no visions either.

121
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,330
还有好多这种树皮
And many more of the same.

122
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,540
帕丽丝
Paris.

123
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,540
怎么了  你知道这些是什么
What? Do you know what they are?

124
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:42,920
是的
Yes.

125
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:49,090
这些是书
They... they are books.

126
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,640
书是什么
What are books?

127
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,900
我祖母给我讲过
My grandmother told me stories

128
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,180
她祖母的祖母给她讲过的故事
her grandmother's grandmother told her.

129
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,900
我梦见过她和书在一起
I dreamt them with her.

130
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:07,320
书是神圣的
Books are in the holy shape.

131
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,580
它们寂静无声  然而
They are silent, and yet

132
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:14,330
它们直接和想象对话
they speak directly into the imagination.

133
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:20,370
你可以烧掉它们  但它们比火更强大
You can burn them, but they are more powerful than fire.

134
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:25,210
亘古以来所有的知识都记录在内
All the knowledge of the ancient ones are put into them.

135
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:30,010
视觉时代的秘密
Secrets of the age of vision.

136
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:35,220
我祖母的祖母有她自己的书
My grandmother's grandmother had books of her own.

137
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,930
但是猎巫者把它们都烧了
But the Witchfinder burnt them all.

138
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:43,770
我以为  所有的书都被烧光了
I thought... all the books had been burnt.

139
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,160
杰拉马瑞尔说我们必须等12年
Jerlamarel said that we must wait 12 summers

140
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,490
才能把这些书给孩子们
before we give them to the children.

141
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,870
他一定是相信他们继承了
He must believe that they have inherited

142
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:52,250
他能倾听无声的能力
his ability to hear silence.

143
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,490
他可以相信  但不代表就是事实
He can believe, but that does not make it true.

144
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,630
我的孩子可能没有被诅咒
My babies may not be cursed.

145
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,670
诅咒
Cursed?

146
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:01,210
我们住在一个永远与世隔绝
We're here, living alone forever,

147
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,710
充满迷信的村子里
in a village filled with superstition.

148
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,500
也许你的孩子们不会永远待在这里
Maybe your children won't stay forever.

149
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,130
什么意思
Meaning what?

150
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,140
什么意思  帕丽丝
Meaning what, Paris?

151
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,730
在确定他们有这种能力之前
Until we know for certain that they have the ability,

152
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,210
我们之间不要有任何分歧
there must be no dispute between us.

153
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:21,050
我们一定要把它们当成珍贵的种子埋起来
We must bury them like precious seeds.

154
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:24,760
因为它们是来自杰拉马瑞尔的礼物
Because they are a gift from Jerlamarel.

155
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,150
而杰拉马瑞尔的礼物向来"很好"
And Jerlamarel's gifts are always good.

156
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,540
你还有其他主意吗  玛格拉
You know different, Maghra?

157
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,290
巴巴沃斯
Baba Voss...

158
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,110
把书埋到风信子树下
bury the books by the hyacinth tree.

159
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,260
接下来的12年  我们对此一个字都不要提
And for 12 summers, we will not speak a word of this.

160
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:23,610
暗影
Shadow?

161
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,690
暗影
Shadow.

162
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,950
我收到你的消息了
I got your message.

163
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,350
我来了
I'm here.

164
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,020
你在吗
Are you there?

165
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,170
暗影
Shadow?

166
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,830
她不肯说话
She wouldn't speak.

167
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,820
她把她听到的  用绳结记了下来
She tied what she heard.

168
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:25,640
有三个人在场  巴巴沃斯  帕丽丝和玛格拉
There were three present. Baba Voss, Paris, and Maghra.

169
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,430
他们说起了孩子
They spoke about the babies.

170
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,700
巫师呢
What of the witch?

171
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,930
只说起了孩子
The babies.

172
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,800
他们哭泣  吃奶  哼哼唧唧  没别的了
They're wailing, they're feeding, they're cooing, nothing else.

173
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,250
她就说了这些
This is what she said.

174
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,710
暗影撒谎
The Shadow is lying!

175
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,290
也许是的
You may be right.

176
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,980
她可以不回答我的问题
She may not answer my questions.

177
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,360
但是我要把巫师的消息透露出去
But I'm gonna send news of a witch.

178
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,400
然后猎巫者可以让他们...
And then the Witchfinders can ask them...

179
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,010
消息  你要怎么发消息
News? How are you going to send news?

180
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,160
漂流瓶
A message.

181
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:05,440
它会顺着溪流飘过数十个山谷
It will flow downstream through a dozen different valleys.

182
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,450
谁知道谁会捡到它呢
Who knows who will find it?

183
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,090
只有海狸会捡到
A beaver will find it.

184
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:13,050
但我可以一天扔两次
But I will do it twice a day.

185
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:15,240
甚至扔三次
Three times a day.

186
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,280
总有一天  我们的祈祷将得到回应
And one day, our prayers will be answered.

187
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:22,520
河流和山谷太多了  可能要好几年的时间
There are so many valleys and rivers. It will take years.

188
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,930
或许吧
Perhaps.

189
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,080
但我们还有希望
But we will have hope.

190
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,230
别动
Hold!

191
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,060
我的朋友
My friend.

192
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,890
我就知道会发现你一个人在这里
Knew I'd find you out here all by yourself.

193
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,710
你怎么样
How are things with you?

194
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,030
一切皆好
All is well.

195
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,130
那就好
Good.

196
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:45,890
你呢
And you?

197
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:49,250
你也一切都好吗
Is all well with you too?

198
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,250
你真的想知道吗
Do you really wanna know?

199
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,130
当然了
Of course.

200
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:03,510
现在  情况不太好
Things are, are not so good.

201
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:07,090
我睡不着
I have trouble sleeping.

202
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,140
听你这么说我很遗憾
I'm sorry to hear that.

203
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,260
我白天听说的一些事  让我晚上难以入睡
You see, I hear things during the day that keep me awake.

204
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,230
什么样的事
What sort of things?

205
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,120
我感觉到身边有强烈的不信任感
I feel a great mistrust around me.

206
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:25,840
我担心有人费尽心思地监视我
I fear someone may have even gone to great lengths to spy upon me

207
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:29,580
以及跟我亲近的人  就在我的家中
and those closest to me, inside my own home.

208
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,570
那几乎是不可能的
It is highly unlikely.

209
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,030
你和你姨妈对我和我的家人
It is no secret that you and your aunt

210
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,290
心怀怨恨  这可不是什么秘密
bear ill will towards me and my family.

211
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:43,100
我想着  如果有判断力欠缺的人
I thought if there was someone out there with poor judgment

212
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,710
试图挑衅我
to want to provoke me,

213
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,690
那你应该最清楚
you, of all people, might know them.

214
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:53,570
但你不知道  对吧
But you don't, do you?

215
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,630
没错  我不知道
No, I do not.

216
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,810
很好  这很好
Good. That's good.

217
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:11,450
我希望你记住  在这里我就是律法
I want you to remember, I am the law here.

218
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:16,890
任何人都可以来找我  坦承心中的想法
Anyone and everyone can come to me and speak their mind,

219
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:19,700
如果他们在诉说时勇敢地面对我
and if they face me when they speak,

220
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:23,780
那在他们面前的就是一个公正公平的人
they will meet a fair man, a just man.

221
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,920
也就是我现在的样子
The man that I am right now.

222
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:30,400
但如果让我听到风言风语
But if I hear whispers in the wind,

223
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:34,180
那我必会亲自找出说这些话的人
and I must discover the speaker myself,

224
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:39,270
然后他或她  将面对曾经的那个我
then he or she may face the man that I once was.

225
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:46,320
一个嗜好鲜血和恐怖的人
A man with the taste for blood and terror.

226
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:57,350
如果有人有话要说  盖瑟拜克斯
If someone has something to say, please, Gether Bax,

227
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,390
叫他们来找我说清楚
tell them to find me and say it...

228
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:04,600
别被我先揪出来
before I find them first.

229
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,280
都听好
Hear me!

230
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:42,410
你们没能向我提供我要求的信息
You have failed to give me the information I asked for.

231
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,790
因此你们失去了家园
And you've lost your homes.

232
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:51,770
立刻交代  这样你们不至于连性命也丢掉
Speak now so you may not lose your lives as well.

233
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,140
告诉我你们所知的
Tell me what you know

234
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,360
关于那个叫杰拉马瑞尔的异端者和恶魔的一切
about the heretic and devil called Jerlamarel.

235
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:03,730
告诉我你们所知的关于他孩子的一切
Tell me what you know about his children.

236
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,370
我们  我们什么都没听说
We... we hear nothing.

237
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:08,570
求求你了  放过我们吧
Please, I beg you, let us be.

238
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,340
如果你什么都没听说
If you've heard nothing,

239
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,570
那你的耳朵对我来说也毫无用处
then your ears are no use to me.

240
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,620
信使
Messenger!

241
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,320
有信息要传给女王
A report for the queen.

242
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:03,030
"我们搜索阳冢周围的山林
"We have been searching in the mountains

243
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:05,960
已经几个月了
of the Sun Grave land for months now.

244
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,520
我们向神祈求指引
We pray to God always for guidance,

245
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:13,200
但却没有信息  没有气味  没有记号  没有希望
but we get no word, no scent, no markers, no hope.

246
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,020
但阳冢地区的村庄都很分散
But the villages of the Sun Grave world are scattered.

247
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:19,830
有太多的山脉和人迹罕至的高原
There are many mountains and lost plateaux.

248
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:25,510
惧怕熊和狮子的人  都驻扎在自己的防卫措施内
The people fear bears and lions and remain inside their defenses.

249
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:27,830
所以
And, so,

250
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,990
我怀着沉重的心情  寻求您的指示
it is with heavy heart that I now seek your instruction.

251
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,360
我的任务结束了吗
Is my mission ended?

252
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:38,150
我认为现在已经无望了
I believe it is now hopeless.

253
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:42,330
我谦卑地请求让我们回到帕岩王国
I humbly request that we be allowed to return to Payan.

254
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:47,520
我依然是您忠心的仆人  塔玛奇俊"
I remain your devoted servant, Tamacti Jun."

255
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:52,040
能让我亲自读取消息吗
May I read the message for myself?

256
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,280
-我已经全部念给您听了  -给我
- I have read it to you in its entirety. - Give it to me.

257
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,910
我的手指很敏感  你可能遗漏了一些信息
I have very sensitive fingers. You may have missed something.

258
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:24,450
第一段确实是塔玛奇俊传来的
The first arm's length is indeed from Tamacti Jun.

259
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,440
第二段却不是
The second arm's length is not.

260
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,200
塔玛奇俊永远不会谦卑  他也不是仆人
Tamacti Jun is never humble, he's not a servant,

261
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,560
根据我和塔玛奇的秘密约定
and by secret agreement between Tamacti and I,

262
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,480
他每隔十个字就会打一个心形结  以避免有人伪造
he always ties a heart every tenth to avoid forgery,

263
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:40,500
萨克大人  这确定无疑是伪造的
and this, my Holy Lord Sak, is a forgery.

264
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,670
是别人写的  故意派你来配合  跪下
Others wrote it. You were sent. Kneel.

265
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,360
-陛下...  -我叫你跪下
- Your Majesty... - I said kneel!

266
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,750
塔玛奇俊是皇家税收人和猎巫者
Tamacti Jun is the royal tax collector and the royal Witchfinder.

267
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,020
他已经效忠我20年了
He's commissioned to serve 20 summers,

268
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,330
并且还将再效忠20年
and 20 summers he will serve.

269
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:03,660
在他效忠的每一天
And every single day of his service,

270
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,150
他都会猎杀杰拉马瑞尔
he will hunt for Jerlamarel.

271
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,960
因为憎恶和仇恨
For hatred and vengeance

272
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:13,490
是两匹给他拉车的野马
are the two wild horses pulling his carriage.

273
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,490
是谁派你来欺骗我的
Who sent you to lie to me?

274
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,560
其他担心的人
Others with concerns.

275
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,400
哪些其他人
Which others?

276
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:26,060
其他希望让您恢复理智的人  陛下
Others who wish to make you see reason, Your Majesty.

277
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,830
陛下  异端者杰拉马瑞尔已经消失了
Your Majesty, the heretic Jerlamarel is lost.

278
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,360
我们这里面临着麻烦
We have troubles here.

279
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:33,530
神圣之力正在消退
The holy power is fading.

280
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,350
永恒之墙的墙缝开始渗水
Water is coming through cracks in the eternal wall,

281
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,220
水面在升高
and the level is rising.

282
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,650
神灵现在的歌声只有两种声音
The gods now only sing with two voices.

283
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:46,900
人民正在质疑您的力量
People are questioning your power.

284
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:50,390
您需要将军队召回来守在这里  陛下
You need your army here, Your Majesty.

285
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,710
那些假结是谁打的
Who tied the false knots?

286
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,300
卡恩大人
Lord Carne.

287
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,370
纪夫人
Lady Zee.

288
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:06,530
还有吗
And more?

289
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,740
没有了
None.

290
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,170
说谎之人受死吧
Choke on your own lies.

291
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,310
我想祈祷
I wish to pray.

292
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:21,420
杰拉马瑞尔  我唯一的真爱
Jerlamarel... my one true love.

293
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,950
曾经  我也如这般和你一起祈祷
Once, I prayed with you like this.

294
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,120
曾经  我们不需要言语就能交流
Once, we spoke to each other without words...

295
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,370
但你现在已经不再跟我说话
but you no longer speak to me.

296
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,680
那么我就在祈祷时跟你说话
So I'll speak to you in a prayer.

297
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:49,010
杰拉马瑞尔  安然地回来吧
Jerlamarel... come home in peace...

298
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,520
让我孕育你的孩子
and beat your pursuers to my body.

299
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,390
我将宽恕你的罪过
I will forgive your sins.

300
00:31:56,650 --> 00:32:00,770
快回来  让我诞下继承了你力量的孩子
Come back and give me children with the power, your power.

301
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:04,250
我将宣布视觉为异端邪教
I will proclaim the Vision heresy.

302
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,930
我将与神明断绝关系
I will renounce the gods.

303
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,680
因为我们的孩子将成为新神
For our children will be the gods.

304
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,500
我将成为你曾经否认的神
And I will be the god you once denied.

305
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,400
永远  永远
Forever and ever.

306
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,140
都听好
Behold...

307
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:31,710
卡恩大人和纪夫人
Lord Carne and Lady Zee...

308
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:35,290
我曾以为他们忠心于我
whom I thought to be faithful to me.

309
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,110
求你了  陛下
Please, Your Majesty!

310
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:40,580
我发现他们犯了叛国罪和伪造罪
I found them guilty of treason and forgery.

311
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,090
我们只是说出了事实真相
We only spoke the truth.

312
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,570
你们都知道的事实真相
The truth you all know.

313
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:49,820
她整日在这里想着杰拉马瑞尔
She only thinks of Jerlamarel when here, at home,

314
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:52,260
发动机一个个坏掉  水面在上升
the engines are breaking, the water is rising.

315
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,390
她不是神...
She is not a go...

316
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,450
这是实话
It is true.

317
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:10,220
我为拯救你们的生命
The battle I fight to save your lives...

318
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:15,550
拯救神圣的帕岩城  经历了一场苦战
and to save your holy Payan city is a hard one.

319
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,070
但我依然奋力抗争了
But I fight it

320
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:20,160
因为那是我们家族的命运
because that is the lot of my lineage.

321
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,350
如同神灵指引我的那样
As God instructs me,

322
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:28,260
祂许我多少神力  我就是怎样的神
I am a god as much as he allows.

323
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:32,490
作为神在地上的执行者  我阻止了毁灭
So, as his hands on earth, I hold back destruction,

324
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,970
让你们享受到冬暖夏凉  为防护栅栏注入魔力
warm the winter, cool the summer, put magic in our fences

325
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,400
阻拦狮子和熊的侵袭
against lions and bears

326
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,910
否则它们会伤害你们的孩子
who would otherwise destroy your children...

327
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:46,120
哪怕它们已经吃饱
even on full bellies.

328
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:55,680
但我经历的更伟大的战斗是对抗光明
But the greater battle I fight is against light...

329
00:33:56,510 --> 00:34:00,250
那是一种将人类置于神明之上的力量
a power that puts man above God...

330
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:02,870
那种力量将再次
a power that would, once again,

331
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:06,370
为复原的世界套上枷锁
put leather reins and chains on a world restored.

332
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:11,220
我们的军队在外面  对抗着那些光明魔鬼
Our armies are out in the field, fighting these devils of light.

333
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,700
我们应该尊崇他们
We should honor them.

334
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:18,020
而不是背着他们密谋叛国
Not whisper treason behind their backs.

335
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,060
反对我
To speak against me...

336
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:31,630
就是加速光明和毁灭的再次到来
is to speed a return of light and destruction.

337
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,620
这绝不能被宽恕
It cannot be forgiven.

338
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,740
很遗憾
With regret,

339
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:44,800
老朋友们  只能去了
old friends... go.

340
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:02,340
♪我们是帕岩人♪
♪ We are Payan ♪

348
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:43,870
三年后

349
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:09,750
我给孩子们带了一些蔷薇果来
I brought some rose fruit for the babies.

350
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:18,550
玛格拉
Maghra...

351
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,600
-我感到空气中...  -是的
- the air I feel... - Yes.

352
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,440
是的  没错
Yes, you do.

353
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:29,500
你感觉到悲伤  或许也有些快乐
You feel sorrow and joy somewhere, perhaps,

354
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:32,290
但主要是悲伤
but mostly sorrow.

355
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,020
给
Here.

356
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,280
这是他们最爱的玩具
Their favorite toy.

357
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:45,400
你想将它放在哪里都行  别弄出声
Place it anywhere, anywhere you like, just quietly.

358
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:04,970
哈妮瓦  可风  你们的玩具在哪儿
Haniwa, Kofun, where's your toy?

359
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,740
去找你们的玩具
Go find your toy.

360
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,090
你找到了吗
Do you have it?

361
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,300
乖女儿
Good girl.

362
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,680
给帕丽丝婶婶
Now give it to Aunty Paris.

363
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,270
去玩吧
Go play.

364
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,310
如果我盖住他们的眼睛  他们就找不到了
And if I cover their eyes, they can't do it anymore.

365
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,320
我已经知道很久了  但我...
I've known for a long time. And I ju...

366
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,490
我只是假装不知而已
I just pretended that I didn't know.

367
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,700
现在确定无疑了
And now it is certain.

368
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,370
对谁而言
To who?

369
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:44,330
巴巴
Baba!

370
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,540
过来  宝贝们  过来
Come here, my loves. Come.

371
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,290
你们先出去玩吧
You may go outside and play.

372
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,920
我等下就出来
I'll be right out.

373
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,570
我其实早就知道了  之前哈妮瓦抓着我的手
I have known since Haniwa grabbed at my hand

374
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:16,950
跟我说  太阳有个妹妹  只有晚上才出来玩
and told me the sun had a sister that came out at night to play.

375
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,320
我知道
I know.

376
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:26,830
看来杰拉马瑞尔跟你说的是真的  巴巴沃斯
So, what Jerlamarel told you was true, Baba Voss.

377
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:31,380
这对双胞胎是一个新世界的开始
These twins are the beginning of a new world.

378
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:34,130
我建议我们公开事实真相吧
I say we declare the truth.

379
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:36,420
他们是我的宝贝
They are my babies.

380
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:41,050
苏特拜克斯和盖瑟拜克斯已经说我们是巫师了
Already Souter Bax and Gether Bax speak of us as witches.

381
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:43,850
他们有朋友  而且越来越多
They have friends, more and more.

382
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:47,350
我建议我们隐瞒事实真相
I say we hide, we hide the truth.

383
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:55,030
杰拉马瑞尔说要等12年
Jerlamarel said 12 summers.

384
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,570
在那之前我们什么也不说
We say nothing until then.

385
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:06,700
在那之前  他们要闭上双眼活着
And until then, they will live with their eyes closed.

386
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,170
很久很久以前
Once upon a time,

387
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:22,090
有四个兄弟姐妹
there were four brothers and sisters

388
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,310
幸福快乐地生活在一个村子里
living happily together in a village,

389
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:26,770
就像我们的一样
just like ours.

390
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,390
他们每天一起劳作
They all worked together every day.

391
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:34,360
一个能调出最芳香的香水
One made the most fragrant perfume.

392
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:38,530
一个能烤出最香甜的蛋糕
Another baked the sweetest cakes.

393
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,740
一个能弹奏出最优美的乐曲
Another played the most exquisite music.

394
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:48,120
第四个能用丝绸织出如融雪般轻盈的
And the fourth wove silk for sheets and dresses

395
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:51,290
被单和衣裙
that felt like warm snow.

396
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:56,000
他们每天都快乐地分工合作
And they all worked happily together every day,

397
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,420
从来不争吵
and they never quarreled.

398
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,470
但有一天
But then one day,

399
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,510
有一个男孩来到村里
a boy came along

400
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:06,390
自称是他们失散多年的亲哥哥
who said he was their long-lost older brother.

401
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:11,350
但当四兄弟姐妹询问他负责做什么时
But when the sisters and brothers asked him what he did...

402
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,980
他说他告诉人们真相
he said he told people the truth.

403
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,240
"什么真相"  他们问道
"What truth?" they asked him.

404
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:23,360
"这个嘛"  他答道
"Well," he replied...

405
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:29,500
"我可以告诉你们  你们其中一人很英俊"
"I could tell you that one of you is very handsome..."

406
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:34,330
一人很美丽  一人很平庸
one is quite pretty, one is plain...

407
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,290
还有一人很丑陋"
"and one of you is very ugly."

408
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:42,420
他的话让四兄弟姐妹感到十分困惑
The family were very puzzled by his words...

409
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:46,390
因为  如果你还没猜到
because, if you hadn't guessed already,

410
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:49,140
其实他们四人的名字分别是
the names of these brothers and sisters

411
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:57,110
嗅觉  味觉  听觉和触觉
were Scent, Taste, Sound and Touch.

412
00:40:57,610 --> 00:41:02,530
他们原本的世界里并无美丑之分
And there was no "ugly" and there was no "pretty" in their world.

413
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:08,410
"但分别是指谁呢"  他们问大哥
"But which one of us is which?" they asked him, their brother.

414
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:16,210
"既然你们无从得知  就不该在意"  他答道
"Well, since you can't know, you shouldn't care," he replied.

415
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,960
说完他就离开了
And, with that, he went to walk off.

416
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:25,340
"等等  你叫什么"  他们高声问他
"Wait! What's your name?" they called to him.

417
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:31,390
"我叫视觉"  他答道
"My name is Vision," he replied.

418
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:37,980
说完他便骑马离开  留下四人独自沉思
And with that, he rode away and left them all alone to wonder.

419
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:43,190
很快  四兄弟姐妹开始争辩
Soon, the family started quarreling

420
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:45,820
他们之中哪个美丽
about which one of them was beautiful

421
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,780
哪个丑陋
and which one was ugly.

422
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:52,240
他们四人都耗费太多时间
Each one of them spent so much time

423
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,620
思索视觉说过的话
wondering about what Vision had said...

424
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,670
导致香水不再芳香
that the perfume lost its scent...

425
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,380
蛋糕不再香甜
the cakes lost their taste,

426
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,260
音乐不再悦耳
the music lost all harmony,

427
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:08,220
丝绸也变得破旧开裂
and the silk became threadbare and torn.

428
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:15,930
直到有一天  他们再次聚在一起
Until, at last, one day they came together again...

429
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:20,440
决定忘记视觉对他们说过的话
and they decided to forget what Vision had told them.

430
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:26,030
因为在他到来之前  他们都满足于现状
Because before he came, they'd all been perfectly content.

431
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:31,410
不久后  他们又恢复了心满意足的生活
And soon, they were content again.

432
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:39,960
因为他们决定  有他们四个就足够了
Because they decided that just four was just enough.

433
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,760
从此  他们过着幸福快乐的生活
And they all lived happily ever after.

434
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,440
你好
Hi-ho.

435
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,690
你好
Whoo-hoo. Hi.

436
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:09,740
我带了份礼物给双胞胎
I have brought a gift for the twins to share...

437
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:12,990
明天是他们的生日
for their birthday tomorrow.

438
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:17,580
河流解冻后  你就没再提起过
Since the river thawed, you haven't spoken of it.

439
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:18,660
提起什么
Of what?

440
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,540
我们一直等待这一天到来
We've been waiting for this day to come.

441
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:24,800
十二年了  玛格拉
Twelve years, Maghra.

442
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,930
当然了  你想做什么由你决定
Of course, you are free to do as you choose.

443
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,390
你真好啊  帕丽丝
Well, that is good of you, Paris.

444
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:41,480
如果你认为他们还是太年幼  你想等多久
If you think they are still too young, how long will you wait?

445
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,730
巴巴沃斯和我已经决定了
Baba Voss and I have made a decision.

446
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,740
已经埋葬的秘密就永远不要挖出来
What is buried stays buried... forever.

447
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,200
那就是你的选择吗
That is your choice?

448
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:00,960
是我们共同的选择
It's our choice.

449
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,170
没什么能离间我们  帕丽丝  包括你
Nothing comes between us, Paris, not even you.

450
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:06,840
就这样让他们闭上双眼在这里成长  生活
So they just walk around with their eyes closed and grow,

451
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,920
直到死去吗
live, die here.

452
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,470
-只在这里...  -这是为了保命
- And only here... - To live!

453
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:12,760
难道这不是最重要的吗  帕丽丝
That is the thing. No, Paris?

454
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,430
我对他们只有这个冀望  就是活下去
That is what I want for them, that they live.

455
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:17,350
如果他们的秘密泄露了
If their secret should slip,

456
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:19,220
如果箱子里的东西暴露了他们的能力
if something from that box should give them away,

457
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:21,770
如果出现什么意外
if something, anything were to happen,

458
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:23,270
而且有无数可能发生的意外
and a thousand other "ifs,"

459
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:24,610
他们就会被烧死
they would burn.

460
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:27,690
或是如果箱子里的书籍叫他们离开村子
Or if the books in the box should tell them to leave the village

461
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:30,690
结果他们沦落狮腹和熊腹
and they become food for lions and bears,

462
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,610
那他们也会死
then they will die.

463
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:36,280
人死了  双眼就会永远闭上了
And if you're dead, your eyes are closed forever.

464
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:42,120
总有一天  会有人发现我们  发现他们
One day, someone will find us, will find them.

465
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,000
玛格拉  他们必须做好准备
Maghra, they need to be prepared.

466
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,380
-够了  -不  不够
- Enough! - No, not enough!

467
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:49,250
这种生活远远不够
This life is not enough.

468
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:51,380
你的理由也不够
Your excuse is not enough.

469
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:54,800
我不需要给你任何理由
I don't need to give you any excuses.

470
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,180
那杰拉马瑞尔呢
What about Jerlamarel?

471
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:01,470
杰拉马瑞尔  他可没有养育这两个孩子
Jerlamarel? Jerlamarel did not raise these children.

472
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,980
他没有帮过他们退烧
He did not break their fevers.

473
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:04,230
也没有哄过他们睡觉
He did not love them to sleep

474
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:07,020
因为他走了  浪迹天涯
because he was gone, just wandering.

475
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:09,980
你的声音
Your voice.

476
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:12,440
你恨他
You hate him.

477
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:15,360
为什么
Why?

478
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:17,870
玛格拉
Maghra?

479
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:24,330
而且你为何把恨意发泄到孩子身上
And why are you taking your hate out on them?

480
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:25,290
妈妈
Mama!

481
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:30,050
你走吧  帕丽丝
Go away, Paris.

482
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,510
我想和我的孩子们单独相处
I want to be with my children.

483
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:55,570
帕丽丝
Paris.

484
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:59,030
进来  坐吧
Hey, come in. Come sit.

485
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:01,580
我的宝贝们
Oh, my babies.

486
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:06,080
你们长大了  生日快乐
Oh, my big ones, happy birthday.

487
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,750
你们今天十二岁了
You are 12 years old today.

488
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:14,260
天啊
My.

489
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:19,510
十二年了  你们都保守着一个秘密
For 12 years, you have kept a secret.

490
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,930
并且你们把这秘密保守得很严实
And you have kept it very well.

491
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:26,560
我想知道  你们能再守住一个秘密吗
I wonder, could you keep another?

492
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,520
是什么
What is it?

493
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:34,440
是一种只有你们能享用的东西
It is for you and for you only.

494
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:39,990
这是有史以来最伟大的生日礼物
It is the greatest birthday gift of all time.

495
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:42,530
是什么东西
What are they?

496
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,080
是书
They are books.

497
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,790
我们认为是书
We think they are books.

498
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:48,300
给  这些是指示
Here. Here are the instructions

499
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,290
指导你们听见书中所言之物
that will help you hear what the books are saying.

500
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,420
是谁给的指导
Instructions from who?

501
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:54,590
你们的父亲
From your father.

502
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,090
爸爸能了解些什么
What does Dad know about this?

503
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:57,840
不是
No.

504
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:01,680
是你们真正的父亲
From your true father.

505
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:04,390
什么
What?

506
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:07,310
我只知道你们的母亲告诉我的只言片语
I only know what your mother told me.

507
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:09,520
我本来希望她能亲自告诉你
I was hoping that she would tell you herself.

508
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,310
我们已经有父亲了
We already have a father.

509
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:16,360
我知道  并且他非常爱你  可风
I know, who loves you so very much, Kofun.

510
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:22,570
哈妮瓦  但还有个男人
Haniwa... there is also a man...

511
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:27,500
从暴风雪中救了你们的母亲
who rescued your mother in a blizzard.

512
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,920
她是这么说的
That's the story she told.

513
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:34,290
她当时迷路了  你们的父亲救了她
She was lost, and he saved her.

514
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,210
然后他和她在一起了
And he stayed with her.

515
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,090
当她来到我们的村庄时
And when she came to our village,

516
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:46,140
已经怀上了你们这对双胞胎
you two, twins, were already inside her.

517
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,730
-他的名字叫杰拉马瑞尔  -不  不
- His name is Jerlamarel. - No, no.

518
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:51,640
-等等  哈妮瓦  -可风
- Wait, Haniwa. - Kofun.

519
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:54,020
-哈妮瓦  -他绝不可以告诉任何人
- Haniwa. - He mustn't tell anyone.

520
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:56,610
给  把这信息拿去你自己看
Here. Take the message and read it.

521
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:59,150
你很勇敢  去吧
You are brave. Go.

522
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:27,890
或许我们就是巫师
Maybe we're witches.

523
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:31,810
或许关于视觉的那些故事是真的
Maybe the stories about vision are true.

524
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:32,560
不
No.

525
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:37,070
事实真相在我手里
I have the truth in my hands.

526
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:40,190
很快我就会知道  但你却不会
Soon I will know and you will not.

527
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:45,530
念出来吧
Go ahead.

528
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:52,660
"很久很久以前
"Once upon a time,"

529
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:56,590
几乎所有人类都拥有你们所拥有的力量
almost all humans had the power that you have.

530
00:48:57,290 --> 00:49:01,420
人类利用这种力量  以及头脑智慧的力量
Human beings used this power, and the power of their minds,

531
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:03,510
征服世界
to conquer the world.

532
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,760
他们造出了可以飞行的机器
They built machines that could fly,

533
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:10,310
可以让人隔着千万里对话的机器
machines that could speak across thousands of miles.

534
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:14,560
他们甚至坐着巨大的飞船离开了地球
They even left the earth in giant ships.

535
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:17,290
跟他们强大的力量一样
Such was their power,

536
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:20,030
他们的存在开始超越地球的承载力
they began to outgrow the earth

537
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:21,440
然后毁掉了地球
and destroy it.

538
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:25,320
有人说是神剥夺了他们的视觉
Some say sight was taken from them by God

539
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:27,820
以阻止这颗星球被他们毁灭
to save the planet from destruction.

540
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:33,830
但经过这么多年  视觉又开始恢复了
But after so many years, the gift of light is being restored,

541
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:38,380
只赐给天选之人
given only to chosen people

542
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:40,840
并指导他们重建世界
with an instruction to build the world again.

543
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:43,550
我是你们的父亲
I am your father.

544
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:46,720
我将这天赐的能力传给了你们
And I have passed this gift on to you.

545
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:50,600
你们的职责就是发挥它的用途
It is your duty to make use of it.

546
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:53,350
从我留给你们的书中学习知识
Learn from the books I have left.

547
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,480
我精心挑选了这些书
I have chosen the books with care.

548
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:59,520
我还留下了一些指示  等你们觉得
I have also left instructions where you should go

549
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:03,320
你们强大到可以离开村庄时  就去那个地方吧
when you feel you are strong enough to leave your village.

550
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,660
我会等着你们的到来
When you come, I will be waiting.

551
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:10,280
我们将一起  重建新世界
Together, we will begin the world anew.

552
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:16,500
爱你们的慈父...
With all my love, your loving father...

553
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:18,960
杰拉马瑞尔"

554
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,050
我们该怎么做

是的  巴巴沃斯
I did, Baba Voss.

557

没有经过我们的允许

558
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:55,660
杰拉马瑞尔从熊爪下救了他们和你的命

他建造了一座桥

560
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:02,210
指引我们的部落来到安全的地方

561

他对你只有一个请求

562
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,340
「让他们学习知识」

563
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:14,600
让他们发现事实真相

564
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:19,020
然后让他们自己做选择

565
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,820
玛格拉会把书都烧掉的

566
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:27,360
-那就别告诉她  -你想让我欺骗她吗
- So do not tell her. - You would have me lie?

567
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,240
多年来  出于善意
For years, you told the twins

568
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:33,370
你一直告诉双胞胎  你就是他们的父亲

我听到他们在谈论要离开这里

573
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,560
-等他们离开时...  -不行

577
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,870
虽然我们躲藏在这里
Just because we are hiding here

578
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,040
但这并不代表世界已经变了

579
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:29,260
但是巴巴  双胞胎可能就是改变世界的力量
But the twins, Baba, the twins might be the change.

580

沉默不是欺骗

585
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:13,840
巴巴
