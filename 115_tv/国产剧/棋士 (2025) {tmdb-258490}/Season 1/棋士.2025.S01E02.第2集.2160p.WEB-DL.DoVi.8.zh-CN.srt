1
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,840
终于找到你了
There you are.

2
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,300
瞧瞧发生了什么
Look what happened.

3
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,680
瞧瞧我干了什么
Look what I did.

4
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,690
现在你的故事结束了
Your story is over now.

5
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,400
关于你的一切  我亲手终结了
All of you... I ended it.

6
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,820
但我的故事才刚刚开始
But mine is just beginning.

7
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,790
再见  父亲
Goodbye, Father.

8
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,230
我一直都很爱你
I always loved you...

9
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,630
哪怕你从未爱过我
even if you never did me.

10
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,340
快走吧  女王陛下
Please, my queen.

11
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,450
神抛弃了我们
God has abandoned us!

12
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,960
我们是帕岩子民
We are Payan.

13
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,920
我们是神圣的  我们是天选...
We are holy. We are chosen--

14
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:56,550
快走  小家伙
Come on, boy.

15
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,430
好了  真乖
Okay. Good boy.

16
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,280
猛兽沉睡太久了
The beast has slept for too long.

17
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,820
现在它醒来了
And now it is awake.

18
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,460
一切都在我们前方
Everything is ahead of us...

19
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,380
一切重要的东西都在前方
everything that matters.

20
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,050
谢谢你
Thank you.

21
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,550
我做了什么
What have I done?

22
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,180
你给了我一点独处的时间
You gave me some time alone.

23
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,110
抗拒了逼问答案的冲动
Resisted the urge to push for answers

24
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,600
哪怕你明知我无法给出答案
you know I can't give.

25
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,660
你父亲给你的哪个小饰品能这么重要
What could be so important about some trinkets your father gave you

26
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,580
以至于你宁愿拿你孩子和丈夫的命去冒险
that you would risk your children's lives, your husband's life...

27
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,830
也要寻回那东西
just to retrieve it?

28
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,840
我敢肯定  如果关于你已经透露了
I'm sure if there were more to that story

29
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,550
故事的更多隐秘
than you've already divulged,

30
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:00,300
你也会先告诉他们  再告诉我
you would've told them before you would tell me.

31
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,310
不过  我想说...
I will say, though...

32
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,230
还有另外一个问题
there is a different question...

33
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,360
刚刚过去的片刻时间里
I have spent the last little while...

34
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,900
我的大脑始终无法抑制想问的冲动
unable to silence in my mind.

35
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,450
是什么问题
What question is that?

36
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,240
你出现在我们的生命里的那天
The day you arrived in our lives...

37
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,200
你还记得杰拉马瑞尔在离开前
do you remember the last thing

38
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,420
对我说的最后一句话是什么吗
Jerlamarel said to me as he left?

39
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:35,750
我不记得
I don't.

40
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:42,380
他说  "要小心"
He said, "Be careful."

41
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,690
在那一刻  以及此后的每一刻
In that moment, and in every moment since,

42
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,730
我都以为他的意思是
I assumed he meant...

43
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,360
"要小心照顾我爱的这个女人
"Be careful with this woman I love,

44
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,690
小心照顾她即将生育的孩子"
with the children she's soon to bear."

45
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,280
他留下的话对我来说如同磐石
His words have been like a rock to me...

46
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:09,410
坚不可摧  让我多年来一直牢牢记挂着
something solid to hang on to all these years.

47
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,970
但自从我们离开瀑布  踏上这条河流逃亡
But with all that has changed since we left the waterfall

48
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,470
有太多东西都改变了
and set off up this river...

49
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:28,310
我开始琢磨  我是否误解了他的意思
I wonder if I misunderstood what he meant.

50
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,100
他还能是什么意思
What else could he have meant?

51
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,730
如今你的丈夫和孩子们
Now your husband and children,

52
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,230
手无寸铁地步入巨大的危险中
they have walked unarmed into grave danger

53
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,700
一切只因为你的要求
because you said so.

54
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,530
他们几乎没有迟疑
They hardly hesitated.

55
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,990
你也没有
Nor did you.

56
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,300
我感觉到  自从我们踏上这段旅程
I feel something growing in you

57
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,710
往上游进发后  你的体内有什么东西在疯长
since we started upriver on this journey.

58
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:08,680
隐藏在你的声音  你的行事方式里  玛格拉
Something in your voice, in your way, Maghra.

59
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,850
令人敬畏
Something formidable.

60
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,690
亦充满黑暗
Something dark.

61
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,730
我还是那个你认识了几乎一辈子的人
I am the same person you've known for almost a lifetime.

62
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,040
我理解你的困惑  我也容忍你的好奇心
I understand your confusion, and I tolerate your curiosity.

63
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,270
但请不要暗示
But please do not suggest

64
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,420
我丈夫和孩子陷入巨大的危险
that my husband or my children are in grave danger

65
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,990
是因为我有邪恶的动机
because of my sinister motives.

66
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,000
或者我不关心他们的死活
Or that I am indifferent to their welfare.

67
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,890
握住我的手
Hold my hand.

68
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,600
跟我一起祈祷
Pray with me...

69
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:05,490
祈祷他们都能平安无恙地回来
that they'll all come back safe and unharmed.

70
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,460
这些可能是踩踏出来的路
These might be tracks here.

71
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,670
哪里
Where?

72
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,510
这太荒唐了
This is ridiculous.

73
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,820
你们听到了什么
What do you hear?

74
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,190
什么都没有
Nothing.

75
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,580
我听到哼唱声
I hear humming.

76
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,950
没错
Yes.

77
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,670
有一群人  他们都在哼唱
A bunch of people, and they're humming.

78
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,840
从那个方向传来
Coming from that way.

79
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,470
哼唱  谁在哼唱
Humming? Who's humming?

80
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,500
哼唱
Humming.

81
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,470
这是什么
What is this?

82
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,010
奥派罗族  拾荒者
Opayol. Scavengers.

83
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,370
下面根本没人  看上去像是废弃了
There's no one down there. It looks deserted.

84
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,790
并没有
It isn't.

85
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,410
他们晚上出来活动  白天躲着睡觉
They're about by night, and they sleep by day.

86
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,420
就是他们拿走了我们的东西
They're the ones who took our things.

87
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,540
他们绝对就在下面
They're most definitely down there.

88
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,630
但我不知道具体有多少人
What I can't say is how many men.

89
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,850
我猜他们的人数比我们多得多
I'm guessing there's a lot more of them than there are of us.

90
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,890
-那是自然  -我们不能回去
- Easily. - We're not turning back.

91
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:37,560
我猜他们的武器也比我们多得多
I'm also guessing they're a lot less unarmed than we are.

92
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,690
不管你妈的东西有多重要
Whatever the significance of your mother's possessions,

93
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,820
我相信她肯定不会希望你们任何一个为此丧命
I am certain she would not want either of you dead over it.

94
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,810
我同意
Me too.

95
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,070
但我可以悄悄潜入再出来
But I can get in and out of there

96
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,060
完全不被他们察觉
without them even knowing I was there.

97
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,450
任何人都不准单独行动
No one's going anywhere alone.

98
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,860
我必须单独行动
I have to go alone.

99
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,610
那样我才最不可能被抓到
I'm least likely to get caught that way.

100
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,210
我可以偷偷溜进溜出
I can slip in and out.

101
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,490
你自己也说了  大白天他们很可能在睡觉
You said so yourself, they're probably asleep.

102
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,000
但只要你吵醒一个  其他人也很快会聚过来
But if you wake one of 'em, the other ones will come out quickly.

103
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,370
那我就避开他们
Then I'll avoid them.

104
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,470
妈妈心里清楚要找到那东西会有多困难
Mama knew how difficult it would be to find this,

105
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,130
但她还是请求我们这么做
and she's asked us anyway.

106
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:15,510
难道我们认为她不知道这意味着什么吗
Are we saying that we don't trust her to understand what that means?

107
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:16,790
还是说我们认为
Are we saying we think

108
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,600
她无法做出那样的决定
she's incapable of making that kind of decision?

109
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,510
好吧
Okay.

110
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,430
好吧
Okay.

111
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,440
你们两个都在这里
You're both right here.

112
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,480
如果我需要帮助  我会大喊
I'll call out if I need help.

113
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,520
但我必须一试
But I have to try.

114
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,480
这主意糟透了
This is a terrible idea.

115
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,320
不  我们应该阻止她的
No, we should've stopped her.

116
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,030
怎么阻止
How?

117
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,160
她会为我们任何一个人这么做的
She would've done this for any one of us.

118
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,160
我们任何人都阻止不了她
She would not have been stopped by any one of us.

119
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,580
说真的  我觉得这跟我们都没有关系
Honestly, I don't think this has anything to do with us.

120
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,960
我觉得从妈妈提到她父亲的那一刻起
I think the moment that Mom mentioned her father,

121
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,630
以及她跟他的情感联系
her connection to him,

122
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,340
哈妮瓦就已经做出了决定
Haniwa's decision was made.

123
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,950
其实也根本不需要做什么决定
You know, there wasn't even a decision to be made.

124
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,300
而是不可避免的事实
It was unavoidable.

125
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,080
一想到缺位的父亲
The idea of an absent father,

126
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,380
有可能重续父女情的机会
the chance to reconnect,

127
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,500
那就...
it was just...

128
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,130
过于贵重  对她来说难以承受
It was too much for her.

129
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,350
我只怕不会有...
And I'm just afraid that there's not gonna be--

130
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,100
不好
Oh, no.

131
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,310
哈妮瓦
Haniwa!

132
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,220
哈妮瓦  哈妮瓦
Haniwa. Haniwa.

133
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,500
-她还有呼吸吗  -有
- Is she still breathing? - Yeah.

134
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,770
-她伤到了哪里  -我看不出来
- Where's she hurt?  - I can't see.

135
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:22,640
爸爸
Dad!

136
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,270
等等  不  等等  不要
Wait. No. Wait. No, no!

137
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,600
不要  住手
No. Stop.

138
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,740
住手  你不知道他是谁
Stop! You don't know who he is!

139
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,260
我不管他是谁
I don't care who he is!

140
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,120
他的胸膛
His chest.

141
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:21,790
你看  触摸  触摸一下
Look. Feel. Feel.

142
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,840
起来  给我起来
Get up. Get up.

143
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,590
他也能看得见
He can see.

144
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,400
这里空荡荡的
So empty here.

145
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,030
我出生在发动机的轰鸣声中...
I was born into the sound of the engines...

146
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:25,350
雷鸣  权势
thunder, power...

147
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:27,970
意义
meaning.

148
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,440
我这一辈子都浸在其中
I spent my entire life bathed in it.

149
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:39,450
从未远离过都城  远到听不见那些声音的地方
Never ventured far enough from the capital that I couldn't hear it.

150
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,080
我一直很好奇
I always wondered

151
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,220
如果我再离开得远一点  世界会是什么样的的声音
what the world would sound like if I'd ventured a little... further.

152
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:53,320
结果发现  根本就没有什么特殊的声音
Turns out, sounds like nothing at all.

153
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,940
真是无趣得令人难以置信
How unbelievably boring.

154
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,510
您听水的声音  女王陛下
Listen to the water, my queen.

155
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,370
以及风的声音
And the wind.

156
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:11,000
或许如果您仔细听  就能听到它在对您耳语秘密
And perhaps if you listen, it might whisper its secrets to you.

157
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,160
这里才没有什么秘密
There are no secrets here.

158
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,840
没有信息
No information being bargained.

159
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,070
没有故事
No stories being woven.

160
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,630
没有力量  没有恐惧
No strength, no fear.

161
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,760
空无一物
Nothing.

162
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,590
普通人都是这样生活的吗
Is this really how people go about their lives...

163
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,400
生命中全无任何重要的东西
in the absence of anything of any importance?

164
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,600
我想是吧  女王陛下
I suppose so, Your Majesty.

165
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,460
这趟旅程或许需要这么做
This journey may require it,

166
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,480
但我觉得恐怕我不擅长做普通人
but I don't think I'll be very good at being that person.

167
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,650
我觉得自己恐怕没有一丝地方
I don't believe there's even the smallest part of me

168
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,050
能适应这种生活
that is built for it.

169
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,390
我饿了
I'm hungry.

170
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,050
我饿了
I'm hungry!

171
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,230
我准备好用餐了
I'm ready to take my dinner.

172
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,430
你找到蛋了吗  现在正是产蛋的季节
Did you find eggs? 'Tis the season.

173
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,000
车夫
Driver?

174
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,150
我听到火快要熄灭的声音  你找到食物了吗
I hear the fire dying. Did you find food?

175
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,190
车夫  你在哪儿
Driver, where are you?

176
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,450
快把火烧起来  它快要被自己的烟弄熄灭了
Save the fire. It's choking on its own smoke.

177
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:54,990
车夫
Driver?

178
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:02,340
车夫  你他妈回个话
Driver? Fucking answer me.

179
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,610
纳丽
Nyrie!

180
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,550
纳丽
Nyrie!

181
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:30,980
纳丽
Nyrie.

182
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,930
纳丽
Nyrie!

183
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,260
你们想要什么我都有
I have whatever you want.

184
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:42,390
你们想要什么我都有  我有戒指  有神骨
I have whatever you want. I have rings. I have God bone.

185
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,460
真柔软
So soft.

186
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,130
纤巧的手指
Exquisite fingers.

187
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,500
不要戒指
No rings.

188
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,430
不要神骨
No God bone.

189
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,560
我们要带你走
We take you.

190
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:57,930
纳丽
Nyrie?

191
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:04,060
纳丽
Nyrie!

192
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,840
妈妈  是我们
Mama, it's us.

193
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,650
哈妮瓦
Haniwa.

194
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,090
来
Come.

195
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,810
你找到了吗
Did you, did you find it?

196
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,170
谢谢
Thank you.

197
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:34,300
我数到四个人
I count four.

198
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,100
我们的新朋友是谁
Who is our new friend?

199
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,750
他们叫他博资
They call him Boots.

200
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,510
浣熊会躲起来
Raccoon hides.

201
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,680
偷我们东西的家伙就是他
This is the creature who took our things.

202
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,690
是的
Yes.

203
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:54,180
但是他不知道我们是谁  他没得选
But he didn't know who we were, and he didn't have a choice.

204
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,060
请让我解释
Let me explain, please.

205
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,190
好
All right.

206
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,920
杰拉马瑞尔离开我们后
When Jerlamarel left us,

207
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,390
就像他承诺的那样  离开我们去了觉悟大宅
left us to go to the House of Enlightenment as he promised...

208
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,900
但他似乎没有直接去那里
it seems he didn't go there directly.

209
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,540
他停下过冬
He made a stop for the winter.

210
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:28,080
他去找了奥派罗族
He approached the Opayol.

211
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,820
和他们住了一年
He lived among them for a year.

212
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,950
一年
A year?

213
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:38,780
但是他的孩子一出生
But... once his child was born...

214
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,660
他就继续上路了
he resumed his journey.

215
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,040
博资就是那个孩子
Boots is that child.

216
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,160
博资是杰拉马瑞尔的儿子
Boots is Jerlamarel's son.

217
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,470
我们的弟弟
Our brother.

218
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,810
在杰拉马瑞尔继续上路之后
After Jerlamarel continued his journey...

219
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:06,610
奥派罗族人把博资当奴隶来使唤
the Opayol treated Boots like a slave.

220
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,620
逼他替他们拾荒和偷东西
Forced him to scavenge and steal for them.

221
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:12,840
当有消息传来
Once word came that the

222
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:15,970
说猎巫者在搜查这一带时
Witchfinder was campaigning through this area,

223
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:18,390
奥派罗族离开了这里  去别处寻求安全
the Opayol left to seek safety elsewhere.

224
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,830
他们把他丢在这里  让他自生自灭
And they abandoned him here to fend for himself.

225
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,930
孩子  孩子
Child! Child!

226
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:28,680
你是说我们带他一起走吗
Are you suggesting we bring him along with us?

227
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,750
是的
Yes.

228
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,590
除了可以让他不必
Aside from offering him a way out

229
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,700
再被人当做动物来对待
of being treated like an animal...

230
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,720
而且他对我们来说很有用  技艺高超的战士
aside from him being an asset to us, a skilled fighter...

231
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,790
他能看见
He can see.

232
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:44,690
是吗
Can't he?

233
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,140
对  他能看见
Yes, he can see.

234
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:55,570
你们俩都同意吗
You two, you are in agreement?

235
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,560
为什么每个人都这样
Why is everyone being like this?

236
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,730
他是我们的家人  我们不会弃他不顾
He is family. We're not leaving him behind.

237
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,930
我已经问过你所有想问的问题了
I've asked all the same questions you have.

238
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,700
我也有同样的担忧
I have expressed the same concerns.

239
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,730
然后呢
And?

240
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,290
如果我不同意这件事  帕丽丝
And if I was gonna forbid this from happening, Paris,

241
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,660
我想你现在早就听到我的反对了
I imagine you would have heard me do it by now.

242
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,760
对吧
Don't you?

243
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,810
你还知道他别的什么情况
What else do you know about him?

244
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:26,070
除了他高明的偷窃之术
Aside from his skill as a thief.

245
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,760
你相信他吗
Do you trust him?

246
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:35,890
从来没人这样照顾我
I have never had anyone to look after me

247
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,740
像你们那样彼此照顾
as you do for each other.

248
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,780
如果能成为你们的一份子
To be a part of that,

249
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:43,670
我愿意做你们吩咐的一切
I will do whatever it is you ask of me.

250
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,710
那就让他一起走吧
Then let him come.

251
00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:00,960
让我们开始为自己组建一支视觉大军
Let us begin to build for ourselves an army of the sighted...

252
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:04,340
只要新招募的士兵
so long as its newest recruits are willing

253
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:08,610
愿意宣誓效忠我们当中唯一的将军
to swear their allegiance to the only general we have amongst us.

254
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,230
我宣誓效忠
I swear it.

255
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:15,110
不  证明给我们看
No. Show us.

256
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,060
真是完美的一天
Such a perfect day.

257
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,100
我觉得你的沉默不言
Your total silence I find

258
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:01,810
比她的沉默不言更有意思
far more interesting than her total silence.

259
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:12,550
他们撕裂你们的喉咙时  我一定会在场
You know, I will be there when they slit your throats,

260
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:16,040
提醒你们今天犯了一个多么离谱的错误
reminding you what a fucking mistake you made today.

261
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:31,030
与你分离了太多次
Too many times separating from you...

262
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,950
总担心那会是我们最后一次见面
and worrying it'll be our last.

263
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,410
我们再也不要分开了
Let's never do it again.

264
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,930
我从来没跟你提起过他
I never told you much about him...

265
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,180
关于我父亲
about my father.

266
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,610
我从来没叫你说
I never asked you to.

267
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:58,210
你的出身对我来说不重要
It's never mattered to me where you come from.

268
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:01,270
我知道  你也是
I know. Nor I you.

269
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,210
他死的那天把这个交给我
He gave this to me the day he died.

270
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:10,280
从他记事起  他家人就拥有这个东西
Been in his family for as long as he could remember.

271
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,350
打开吧
Open it.

272
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,690
不惜一切就为了找回这个
All of that for this.

273
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,500
你一定肯定很爱他
Must've loved him very much.

274
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,730
他是个非常好的人
He was a very good man.

275
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:32,660
善良  聪明
Kind, wise.

276
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,650
如果他还健在在  他一定会喜欢你
I think he would've liked you.

277
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,030
别高兴过头了
Let's not get carried away.

278
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,620
真希望我认识他
I wish I'd known him.

279
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,390
也许改天你可以和我多说一点他的事
Perhaps you can tell me more about him sometime.

280
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,690
我很乐意
I think I'd like that.

281
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,430
可风说得对
Kofun is right.

282
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:06,400
我该上路了
I should get moving.

283
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:08,620
当然
Of course.

284
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:12,030
那孩子  博资
That boy, Boots...

285
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,600
你不信任他  对吗
you don't trust him, do you?

286
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,770
我最近不打算相信任何新来的人
I haven't planned on trusting anyone new for a while.

287
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,420
明白了
I see.

288
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,350
那你为什么准许这件事
Then why did you choose to allow it?

289
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,570
你认为我在这件事上还有选择  真让我受宠若惊
I'm flattered you thought I have any choice in the matter.

290
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,320
我是认真的
I'm being serious.

291
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,950
-我知道  -那你为什么不阻止
- I know. - Why didn't you forbid it?

292
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,700
因为在旅程的终点...
'Cause at the end of this journey...

293
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,760
他们将见到一位新的父亲
they will meet a new father.

294
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,890
我不能再给他们任何新理由来渴望他了
And I can't give them any new reason to want one.

295
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:58,370
可风理解我们的选择
Kofun understands our choices.

296
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,910
他总是这样
He always has.

297
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:02,680
不会把这事往心里去
Doesn't take them personally.

298
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,330
但她...
But her...

299
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,020
我不想失去她
I don't wanna lose her.

300
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,220
你不会
You won't.

301
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,130
也许吧
Yes.

302
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,980
我爱你
Love you.

303
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,140
他们不喜欢我  是吗
They don't like me, do they?

304
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,540
他们很害怕
They're scared...

305
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,970
还很困惑
and confused.

306
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,500
但他们是好人  他们会回心转意
But they're good people. They'll come around.

307
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,560
他们喜欢你吗
Do they like you?

308
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:30,350
你在说什么
What did you say?

309
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,150
他们对你大喊大叫
They yell at you.

310
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,300
他们质问你  让你觉得卑微
They question you, make you feel small.

311
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:37,800
我的族人就是一直这样对待我
That is how my people always treated me.

312
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,980
他们为什么要让你戴着面具
Why did they make you wear the mask?

313
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,930
他们说我不像他们
They said I was not like them.

314
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,990
不是一个人  而是别种东西
Not a man, but something else.

315
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,310
他们说面具会提醒着我
They said the mask would remind me.

316
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,710
我的家人爱我
My family loves me.

317
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,540
他们并不总是理解我
They don't always understand.

318
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:16,710
但我从来没有质疑过他们对我的爱
But I have never doubted for one moment that they love me.

319
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:27,470
你受到的待遇  是错误的
How you've been treated, it was wrong.

320
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,100
你值得更好的生活
You deserve better than that.

321
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:33,190
但我保证...
But I promise...

322
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,980
你现在是我们的一员了
you're one of us now.

323
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,980
你再也不会遭受那种境遇了
You'll never be treated that way again.

324
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:47,280
你母亲
Your mother.

325
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:51,490
你觉得她还有余力去爱另一个孩子吗
Do you think she will have room to love another child

326
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,460
像爱你和你哥哥一样
as she already loves you and your brother?

327
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,130
那可能需要一些时间
That may take some time.

328
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,640
这对她来说很复杂
This is complicated for her.

329
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:13,180
但是...
But...

330
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:19,360
我妈妈是我见过最有爱心的人
my mother has the biggest heart of anyone I've ever met.

331
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,530
她做正确的事
She does what's right.

332
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,070
她总是做正确的事
She always does what's right.

333
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,380
你为什么要保守自己的秘密那么久
Why did you keep your secret for so long?

334
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,760
你怎么做到的
How do you do that?

335
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,340
做什么
Do what?

336
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:50,850
偷袭那些能看到你偷偷摸摸的人
Sneak up on people who can see you sneaking up on people.

337
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:53,310
我不是想偷偷摸摸
I wasn't trying to be sneaky.

338
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,350
也许你只是没注意到
Maybe you just weren't paying attention.

339
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,810
你能回答我的问题吗
Will you answer my question?

340
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:02,900
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

341
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:04,610
什么秘密
What secret?

342
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,240
你守护了这么久
You kept it for so long,

343
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,370
甚至都不知道这是个秘密了
you don't even know it's a secret anymore.

344
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:18,330
为什么艾肯尼没有人知道...
Why did no one in the Alkenny know...

345
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,170
你们能看见
that you could see?

346
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:24,880
当猎巫者出现时
Well, given how everyone else reacted

347
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,010
考虑到其他人的反应
when the Witchfinder turned up,

348
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:27,550
我想我父母不告诉他们
I think my parents were probably wise

349
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,840
是个正确的选择
to not trust them with that piece of information.

350
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,860
巴巴和玛格拉被困在了艾肯尼
Baba and Maghra were stuck in the Alkenny.

351
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:46,610
我想他们守护了一个秘密来保护你们俩
And I guess they kept a secret to protect you two.

352
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:49,200
差不多是那样  没错
Something like that, yes.

353
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,240
我能告诉你观察那些不知道
Can I tell you what it's like to observe people

354
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,160
你在观察他们的人是什么感觉吗
that don't know that you're observing them?

355
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,960
对你来说  他们无比脆弱
They are completely vulnerable to you.

356
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,050
你可以守住他们的秘密
You could keep their secrets.

357
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:13,430
你可以把它们传播给敌人
You could spread them to their enemies.

358
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,180
你可以击打他们...
You could strike at them...

359
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,640
但他们永远不可能知道是谁干的
without them ever knowing who did it,

360
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,310
或怎么做的  或其中原因
or how, or why.

361
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:28,280
你可以改变他们的生活
You could change their life.

362
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,450
可以终结他们的生命
Could end their life...

363
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:34,530
不管任何理由...
for any reason...

364
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,410
或者根本没有理由
or no reason at all.

365
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:40,870
神便是如此
That is what gods do.

366
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,710
你可能不知道这是什么感觉
You might not know what this feels like

367
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:48,010
因为你从来没选择去左右他人
because you never made the choice to hold that power over others.

368
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:51,590
这个决定你父母替你做了
It was made for you by your parents.

369
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,140
但我知道
But I know.

370
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:04,440
我想杰拉马瑞尔也知道
And I suspect Jerlamarel knew, too.

371
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,990
对我来说  这能让我更亲近我跟踪的人
For me, it brought me closer to those I shadowed.

372
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,030
对于杰拉马瑞尔...
For Jerlamarel...

373
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:21,160
他在他们中间生了一个孩子  抛弃了他
he fathered a child among them and abandoned him.

374
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,120
那么  这些跟你有什么关系
So, what does any of this have to do with you, anyway?

375
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,290
或许我觉得这很有趣  你能看到
Maybe I find it amusing that you can see

376
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:29,000
但仍察觉不到
and still observe so little.

377
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:46,770
我在哪里
Where am I?

378
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,980
虫城
The City of Worms.

379
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:55,860
我在哪里
Where am I?

380
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,050
我的朋友们
My friends.

381
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,350
你们带了什么给我
What have you brought me?

382
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:21,350
我有一匹马  它需要水
I have a horse. It needs water.

383
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:24,640
我累了  我要睡觉
And I'm tired. I need to sleep.

384
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:26,060
我赶了一整天的路
I've ridden all day.

385
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,560
我要油来擦屁股  还有抹油的女仆
I need oil for my ass and a maid to apply it.

386
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,770
等我睡醒后  再跟你说话
After I've slept, I will speak to you.

387
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,190
你犯了个大错
You've made a mistake--

388
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,290
纤巧的手指
Exquisite fingers.

389
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:53,590
你们干得不错  谢谢  她非常完美
You have done well. Thank you for this. She will be... perfect.

390
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:00,010
蚕是一种神奇的动物
A silkworm is a fascinating creature.

391
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,720
你想知道为什么吗
Would you like to know why?

392
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:09,600
它出生时如此微小  无暇  谦逊
She begins so small, so innocent, unassuming.

393
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:12,770
但在它短暂的一生中
But in the course of her very short life,

394
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:16,150
它创造了如此美丽完美的丝
she creates a substance of such beauty, such perfection,

395
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,570
让世界上最富有的男人
that the wealthiest men in the world,

396
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:21,990
能够为自己  为妻子  为小妾
men who could dress themselves, their wives, their concubines,

397
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:24,450
披上绫罗绸缎的男人
in whatever they desire,

398
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,080
为此趋之若鹜
choose... this.

399
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,210
当它的生命到尽头时  它的功效用尽
And when her life has run its course, her usefulness expired,

400
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:38,090
在它最后的年岁丑陋蜷曲
she spends her final days sadly grotesque.

401
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:42,510
这种带翼的动物渴望飞翔
A winged creature with the urge to fly

402
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,640
却始终未使用这个能力
but denied that ability.

403
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:48,390
蚕茧用尽
A husk of herself, used up,

404
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,440
渴求死亡
eager for death.

405
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,230
你会在这慢慢了解它
You will come to know her well here.

406
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,650
你会慢慢理解它
You will come to understand her.

407
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:05,660
我的朋友  你不希望我在这里
My friend, you do not want me in here.

408
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:09,160
我这辈子都没遇见过虫子
I haven't met a worm in my life.

409
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:15,380
没错  也许它能让你一时心欢
Yeah. Perhaps for a time, it'll amuse you.

410
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:21,800
但很快你会后悔
But soon you will regret it!

411
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,150
是吗
Is that so?

412
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:43,490
你是何方神圣  竟敢放出如此獗言
I wonder who you might be to make such a claim.

413
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:48,250
纤细的手  没干过重活
Delicate hands unused to being worked.

414
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:51,330
粗鲁不恭的嘴  未遭受过惩罚
An impudent mouth unused to being struck.

415
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,710
富裕的女人
A woman of wealth...

416
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,590
习惯于搬弄权力
accustomed to wielding authority

417
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:59,380
或也许是她丈夫的权力
or the authority of a husband, perhaps.

418
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:03,800
但从哪而来
But from where?

419
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,810
猎巫者不久前来过这里
The Witchfinder's campaign brought him through here not long ago.

420
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,980
当他询问信息时
When he was asking for information,

421
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,570
他的口音让我想起了自己在坎祖瓦的年月
his accent reminded me of the time I spent in Kanzua,

422
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:25,570
把商品卖给钱多得没处花的上等贵族
selling our goods to the high-born with money to burn.

423
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:31,960
你的口音也让我想起那段过去
Your accent brings back those same memories.

424
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,710
我猜你是个贵族
You were a noblewoman, I presume.

425
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:44,300
也许甚至是那个贱人女王的议会成员
Perhaps even a councilor to that bitch queen.

426
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,680
但无论如何
But no matter.

427
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:51,680
在这你和其他人一样  或甚至更不值一提
Here you will be the same as the rest, or even less so, perhaps,

428
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,980
因为一切都要从头学起
as everything must be learned from the beginning.

429
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:58,150
如果你为我努力工作  就能活得好
If you work hard for me, you will live well.

430
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:00,270
如果你想逃跑  你也逃不远
If you try to escape, you will not get far,

431
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,240
而后果将会
and the consequences will be...

432
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,820
不堪设想
unpleasant.

433
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,450
你是个有趣的人
You are an interesting one.

434
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:11,660
我很期待和你度过
I look forward to whatever time

435
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:14,160
我们在一起的时间
we are able to spend together here.

436
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,340
聆听我的声音
Hear me...

437
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,920
杰拉马瑞尔
Jerlamarel.

438
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:25,970
杰拉马瑞尔
Jerlamarel.

439
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:27,470
可风
Kofun?

440
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:30,810
我在这里  爸爸
Yeah. Here, Dad.

441
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,270
船松开了吗
Is the boat free?

442
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,390
是的  但被卡住了
It's unmoored, but it's stuck.

443
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:38,690
什么卡住了  被卡在哪里了
What do you mean "stuck"? Stuck where?

444
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:40,150
退潮了
Tide's gone out.

445
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:45,030
我们怎么办
What are we gonna do?

446
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,330
我们只能等早上了
We're gonna have to wait till morning.

447
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:33,700
快来
Come.

448
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:36,580
快跑
Run.

449
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:37,910
过来
Come.

450
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:40,790
快跑
Run.

451
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:19,500
他们没法穿过森林  对吧
They can't ride through this, can they?

452
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,040
他们可以  但会减慢他们的速度
They can. But it'll slow them down.

453
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,680
我听见他们了
I hear them.

454
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:37,770
-哈妮瓦  -我在
- Haniwa. - Yes.

455
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:41,310
带你妈妈和帕丽丝去安全的地方
Take your mother and Paris and find shelter for them.

456
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:43,650
我爱你  快去
I love you. Go. Go.

457
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,360
他们无处不在
They're everywhere.

458
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:58,370
爸爸  我跟你在一起
Dad, I'll stand with you.

459
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:02,040
是的  儿子
Yes, you will, son.

460
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:25,480
待在这里
Stay here.

461
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,530
一切都会没事的
Everything will be all right.

462
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:33,530
玛格拉
Maghra?

463
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:36,570
玛格拉
Maghra?

464
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:42,530

Baba Voss!

465
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,210
妈妈呢  怎么了
Where's Mama? What happened?

466
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:52,840
-她不见了  -哈妮瓦
- She's gone. - Haniwa!

467
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,130
-哈妮瓦  -不
- Haniwa. - No.

468
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:58,300
巴巴  我之前握着她的手
Baba, I had her by the hand.

469
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:59,010
他们抓走了她
They took her?

470
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:02,010
不  她自己放开了我的手
No, she let go of my hand.

471
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:07,060
她在我耳边低语  她说"要小心"
She whispered to me. She said, "Be careful."

472
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:10,940
妈妈
Mama?

473
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:15,820

你听见我的声音了吗  猎巫者
Do you hear my voice, Witchfinder?

476
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:45,180
你听见了吗
Do you hear me?

477
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,280
说话
Speak.

478
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:08,160
猎巫者
Witchfinder...

479
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:12,170
