1
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,160
Dex! Dex!

2
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,840
Hi, Dex.

3
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,280
Here he is. My favorite client.

4
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,040
- Bit mad out there.
- Wait till tomorrow.

5
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,440
Everyone in the country's
gonna want a piece of you.

6
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,600
See?

7
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,480
Did you sleep? Ah. Course you didn't.

8
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,640
Hell of a drug, adrenaline.

9
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,080
But you know, Dex, if you had slept,
that would mean your body and your brain

10
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,440
hadn't grasped
what a fuck-off opportunity this is.

11
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,280
- You're making me nervous.
- Good.

12
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,160
- Dexter.
- Hello, lovely.

13
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,240
- See you before the show.
- Mwah. Mwah.

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,840
How you feeling, man?

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,960
Raring to go.

16
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,480
Coffee, fizzy water, sushi.
Just tell us whatever you need.

17
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,320
Cocaine, call girls.

18
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,280
<i>♪ Where is love? ♪</i>

21
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,160
Thanks, Martin.

22
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,520
Okay. Let's take a break.

23
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,040
- He's gonna get there.
- Any idea what time?

24
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,440
We open in, uh, three hours.
I'd say he's cutting it quite fine.

25
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,680
Sorry to interrupt, but, Ms. Morley,
there's someone on the phone for you.

26
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,600
You can take it in the office.

27
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,520
Oh. Um...

28
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,480
Okay.

29
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,560
Hello?

30
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,640
<i>Hello. I was wondering.
Could you please tell me where is love?</i>

31
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,680
Dexter, you can't just ring me at school.
I thought something was wrong.

32
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,040
I came out of rehearsal.

33
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,480
Sorry. I was just calling
to say good luck.

34
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,040
<i>Yeah. Yeah, good luck to you too.
And I'm sorry I can't be there.</i>

35
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,360
Clash of showbiz moments.

36
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,560
I know, but I wish you were coming.
It's so exciting, Em.

37
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,040
<i>It all feels massive.
People have sent me all this stuff.</i>

38
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,560
You know, like champagne companies
and... and vodka companies.

39
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,440
- There's just stuff everywhere.
- You're squeaking.

40
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,440
Yeah. Well, if I can't squeak with you,
who can I squeak with?

41
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,360
Look, I've really got to go.

42
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,920
It's the dress rehearsal,
and the lead is just so irredeemably shit.

43
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,200
- No wonder they put him in an orphanage.
<i>- Harsh.</i>

44
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,880
<i>But the girl...</i>

45
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,920
The, uh... Oh. The band's
nearly finished sound checking.

46
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,320
Uh, sorry, Em. Gotta boost.

47
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,680
<i>- Oh. Uh... Um...</i>
- Have fun!

48
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,760
Oh. Mr. Godalming.

49
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,000
Everything okay?

50
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,720
Yeah. Yeah, landlord.
Leaky boiler, but it's all sorted now.

51
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,000
Opening night.

52
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,320
Yeah. Well, I mean,
there's only one performance,

53
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,360
so technically also closing night,
which is a relief.

54
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,920
How you feeling?

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,160
Yeah, you know.

56
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,560
Like, this whole thing was the worst idea
I've ever had in my entire life, but...

57
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,640
Apart from that, hunky-dory. Thanks.

58
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,440
How's our Oliver? He looks very emotional.

59
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,280
Yeah, he's been in character
for the last six weeks.

60
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,960
I think if he could,
he'd have given himself rickets.

61
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,520
Well, if anyone
can pull this off, then you can.

62
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,400
The kids adore you.

63
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,200
You're a natural.

64
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,000
Fiona's keen to meet you.

65
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,360
Oh, you know,
I'm looking forward to meeting her too.

66
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,240
- Is your fiancé coming? Is he your fiancé?
- Oh God, no. Just boyfriend.

67
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,400
Right. It'll be nice to meet him
at the aftershow drinks.

68
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,240
Yeah. Yeah.
I've heard rumors of mini Kievs.

69
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,960
And a single bottle
of warm white wine between 60.

70
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,960
- Teaching.
- Oh, and people say it's not glamorous.

71
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,440
Unlike you.

72
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,920
I mean, you look glamorous... tonight.

73
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,400
Oh.

74
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,600
Do I?

75
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,120
Ta very much.

76
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,120
I mean, you look beautiful.

77
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,840
- Er...
- What?

78
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,840
Is that okay
that I just said you look nice?

79
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,440
Yes. Yes, of course. Why wouldn't it be?

80
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,280
Right.

81
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,680
See you... after.

82
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,960
Yeah, see you.

83
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,120
Yeah. Nice.

84
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,560
- Hey, man. Dexter.
- Hey, Dexter. I'm Kyle.

85
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,360
You guys sounded great.

86
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,880
Can't wait to see you kick it live later.

87
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,960
Yeah.

88
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,960
Cool.

89
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,120
Cool.

90
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,640
Nice blokes.

91
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,720
Yeah.

92
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,200
Decca have put a fortune into them.

93
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,200
Blokes. Blokes.
Do people still say "blokes"?

94
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,840
That sounds weird suddenly.

95
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,720
Uh, blokes. Guys.

96
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,560
Yeah, it's maybe a bit weird.

97
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,720
Sorry, Dexter.
Hair and makeup are ready for you.

98
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,320
No worries. No problem.
I'm just gonna grab my script.

99
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,320
<i>Two hours till showtime.</i>

100
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,080
<i>You have one new message.</i>

101
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,840
<i>Uh, Dexter.</i>

102
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,560
<i>This is your father here. I hope
they've put me through to the right room.</i>

103
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,840
<i>I seem to have spoken
to everyone in the building but you.</i>

104
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,280
<i>Um, it's just to say good luck tonight.</i>

105
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,160
<i>I will be watching.</i>

106
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,120
<i>It's all very exciting.</i>

107
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,640
<i>Uh, that's all I wanted to say.</i>

108
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,600
<i>Uh, ah, except also, I... I don't know
if you're still reading reviews,</i>

109
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,360
<i>or... or whatever they're called,</i>

110
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,080
<i>but remember these people
have no idea who you are.</i>

111
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,000
<i>So just... enjoy it.</i>

112
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,600
<i>Goodbye.</i>

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,320
<i>Dexter to hair and makeup, please.</i>

114
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,760
- Hey, Dex.
- Hi.

115
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,560
- Hi, Dex.
- Hello, Dexy.

116
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,240
- Mwah. Mwah.
- Mwah.

117
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,216
- I'm glad it's you.
- I'm glad it's you.

118
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,880
And I'll have another one of those,
thank you.

119
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:48,040
Hey, um, Donna,
have you got a... a newspaper?

120
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,560
Do you know, we didn't get them today.

121
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,880
Now,

122
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,760
what are we gonna do with you
when you are perfect already?

And no disappearing to the shop

Miss Morley?

137
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,400
Hello.

138
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,360
What are you doing here?
It... it doesn't start for ages.

139
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,640
I thought you might need something to eat
before the big night.

140
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,960
Thank you.

141
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,480
That's really sweet.

142
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,960
Of course.

143
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,080
Table for two, madam.

144
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,760
I'm a bit skint, so...
it's just jam, I'm afraid.

145
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,920
- I love a jam sandwich.
- So did Bob Marley.

146
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,760
He liked anything with jam in.

147
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,600
- Didn't even plan that one.
- Mm.

148
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,240
Well, it's gonna be awful, Ian.

149
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,120
Why would it be awful? Hmm?

150
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,120
Today Walthamstow, tomorrow the West End.

151
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Tea?

152
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,840
Thanks.

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,840
- Just you enjoy yourself, darling.
- Thanks, Donna.

156
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,960
No. Don't come near me
and ruin all my good work.

157

- Toby, what do you want?

164
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,360
Ah. I'm looking
for the most odious man on television.

165
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,160
Yeah. I think you'll find
that's you who you're looking for, not me.

166
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,560
Razor-sharp comeback there, Dex.

167
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,960
You seen the papers?

168
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,400
One bad write-up. Not bothered.

169
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,320
So you didn't read <i>The Sun,</i> then?

00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,520
Or <i>The Express?</i> Or <i>The Times?</i>

171
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,120
No one ever built
a statue of a critic, Toby.

172
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,400
True, but no one ever built
a statue of a TV presenter either.

173
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,880
How about a, uh, warm-up guy? Hmm?

I'm just messing with you, big man.

Can you go now, Toby?

178
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,560
I'll leave you to it.

179
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,480
Well, let you get back to those lines.

180

188
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,440
They're not. They're trashing me.

189

190

191

<i>- I can't.</i>

193

There's a thing in the hall after.
I've got to meet the parents.

- Isn't Callum coming?
<i>- Uh, I didn't invite him.</i>

I really only want you.

possible tonight.

199

Bring Ian, of course.

200

Look, if I can, I will, okay?

201
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,840
Amazing. Thanks.

202
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,280

205
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,440

- Jesus Christ!

318
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,800
That is proof
we're going out live!

319
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,320
Camera four on Suki.

320
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,680
Oh yeah!

321
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,480
What the hell was that, Dex?

322
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,280
My mom's out there,
you're spiking my drink.

323
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,240
Okay, we're back.

324
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,960
Right. Cut to VT. Suki link to VT.

325
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,480
And now, while I bollock him,
you watch this.

326
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,720
Three minutes, everyone.

327
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,600
Suki.

328
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,240
- What happened there, Suki?
- Something just went down the wrong way.

329
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,040
<i>And, Dex,
sort yourself out, mate.</i>

330
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,480
Oh!

331
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,720
Come on, everyone!

332
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,760
Oh, wonderful! Oh!

333
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,480
- Let's go get her.
- That was good. I loved it. Yes!

334
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,360
- Go on, Emma.
- Go on, Emma.

335
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,720
Miss, come on.

336
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,280
Bravo!

337
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,520
Hey there.

338
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,200
Great work, D.

339
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,280
Thanks. Was it... Was it okay?

340
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,400
Yeah, it was live, you know.

341
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,800
It was... It was freewheeling and live.

342
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,200
Yeah. I mean,
I've got notes, obviously, but...

343
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,400
Uh, yeah? What... what kind of notes?

344
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,080
Tomorrow. Talk tomorrow.

345
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,320
Ian.

346
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,160
Oh, they're beautiful.

347
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,360
Not from me.

348
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,600
Who, then?

349
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,200
Flash Harry, probably.

350
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,600
Inevitably.

351
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,640
"Em, who will buy my sweet red roses?
Wink, wink."

352
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,360
"So sorry to miss it.
I know it'll be a smash. Dex."

353
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,040
<i>Welcome to</i> Get In!

354
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,480
<i>A feast of great comedy...</i>

355
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,040

356
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,200
Thank you, no.

a great night ahead of us!</i>

358
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,160
Can I borrow a T-shirt?

359
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,560
<i>A special treat for you.</i>

360
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,080
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, of course.

361
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,640
Oh, hello.

362
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,760
Is she throwing up?

363
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,720
Find your camera, Dex.

364
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,120
Jesus Christ.

365
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,760
<i>Jesus Christ...</i>

366
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,600
This is awful.

367
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,000
He looks terrified.

368
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,200
- Majestically bad.
- Ian.

369
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,440
<i>And now, while I bollock...</i>

370
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,600
I think it's meant to be like this.

371
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,840
Yes, it's car-crash TV.

372
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,640
Car crash?

373
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,200
This is full-on train derailment.

374
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,080
He's worse than me.

375
