同志亦凡人 Queer As Folk S01E17

4
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,570
这是我们在凯旋门前
Mmm, here we are in front of the arc de triomphe.

5
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,850
这是圣心堂
And here we are in front of the sacre-coeur.

6
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,350
这是拿破仑公墓前
And here we are in front of Napoleon's tomb.

7
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,350
他已经死了  真幸运
Lucky him. He's dead.

8
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,860
这是我正在把玩..
Here I am playing...

9
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,360
法式面包条  就像是
a loaf of french bread, like a...

10
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,860
你们能不能收敛点？
Would you two cut it out?

11
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,000
妈  你打断我了
Ma, you're interrupting.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,360
我讨厌情侣们在你面前亲热
Well, I hate it when couples make out in front of you.

13
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,360
这是法国啊  我们这是法式热吻
It's French. We're Frenching.

14
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,810
拍完这张照片
And with that,

15
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,890
大卫和迈克就告别了巴黎
David and Michael bid adieu to paris.

16
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:12,940
「Fin」
Fin.

17
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,980
「Fin」  就是「结束」的意思
Fin. That means the end.

18
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,380
「Bon」  是「很好」的意思
Bon. That means good.

19
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,140
希望大家没觉得太无聊
Well, I hope everyone wasn't too bored.

20
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,380
开玩笑吧？
Are you kidding?

21
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,150
自从《甘地》之後我还没这麽开心
I haven't been that entertained since "Gandhi".

22
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,890
噢  真是一生难忘的绝妙旅行
Oh, it just looked like the trip of a lifetime.

23
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,540
的确像是一生那麽漫长
It sure felt that long.

24
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,890
巴黎最让人难忘的
The thing you have to remember about Paris

25
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,890
不是在卢卡斯·卡尔通用餐
is not dining at Lucas-Carton,

26
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:37,900
也不是在圣苏尔比斯购物
or shopping on the Rue de St-sulpice.

27
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,400
而是一些小事
It's the little things.

28
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,070
比如  分享一根长条法式面包
You know, sharing a baguette

29
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,320
漫步在塞纳河边
while strolling Sur La Seine...

30
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,900
塞什麽  亲爱的
The sur le what, honey?

31
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,140
-塞纳  妈妈           -那是条河
-The seine, mother.   -It's a river.

32
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,410
-谢谢你  宝贝   -嗯哼
- Thanks, baby. - Mm-hmm.

33
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,910
谁想来点...红酒？
Would anyone like some, uh,vin rouge?

34
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,910
露茜  你不会觉得
Lucy, you wouldn't know the difference

35
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,410
红酒和漱口水有什麽区别的
between vin rouge and Listerine.

36
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:56,910
好了  我只想知道
Okay, all I want to know is,

37
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,600
你们见到凯瑟琳·德纳芙了吗 (影星)
Did you meet Catherine Deneuve?

38
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,090
天啊  我爱死她了
Oh, god, I love her.

39
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,920
没有  但我们在凡尔赛见到了
No, but we did meet this wonderful couple

40
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,420
一对夫妇
in Versailles.

41
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,920
我猜猜  是路易斯和玛丽 (法国王室)
Oh, let me guess, Louis and Marie?

42
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,930
不  是让·皮埃尔和伊维特  (球星影星)
No, Jean-Pierre and Yvette.

43
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,930
他们在十六大道有座豪宅
They have the most fabulous maison in the 16th.

44
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,260
噢  嚐嚐这白乳酪
Oh, try the brie.

45
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,620
-味道像精液       -天啊
-Tastes like cum. -Oh, jeez!...

46
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,020
切达乾酪在哪里
Where's the cheddar?

47
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,440
-嗨  一起聊聊吗           -行啊
-Hey, mind if I join you? -No.

48
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,940
嘿  宝贝
Hey, sweetie.

49
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,940
嗨
Hi!

50
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,240
哦  天哪  他长得可真快
Oh-ho-ho, god, he gets bigger every time I see him.

51
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:31,490
都归功於吉拉姆给他做的那些法国食物
It's all that delicious french baby food Guillaume makes him.

52
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,270
所以这个协议进行得如何？
So this, uh, arrangement's working out for you?

53
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,010
是啊  比我想的要好很多
Yeah, a lot better than I thought.

54
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:48,470
亲爱的  即使你不想听我这个…
Honey, even if you don't want to listen to me as...

55
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,970
很关心你的人所说的话
someone who cares about you,

56
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,020
你至少也得听听我的法律建议吧
I wish you'd at least take my legal advice.

57
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,890
事实上....  我们一星期之後就要结婚了
Actually... we're getting married a week from today.

58
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,980
他对你做了什麽  搞大你肚子吗
What'd he do? Knock you up?

59
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,980
不  他昨天收到了驱逐令
No, his deportation letter came yesterday.

60
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,480
所以我们得马上办理了
So we have to do it now.

61
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,590
也许迈克能在婚礼上帮我们录影
Maybe Michael can film the ceremony.

62
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,490
这得看起来像真的一样
It's got to look real,

63
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,980
以防听证会上需要用到
in case there's an evidentiary hearing.

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
我快要崩溃了
I am freaking out.

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,500
为何？因为她没请你当伴娘吗？
Why? Because she didn't ask you to be maid of honour?

66
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,670
你以为这很好笑吗？
You think this is funny?

67
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,010
他们就要结婚了  下星期
They're going through with it... Next week!

68
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,010
他们不是真的结婚
It's not like they're really getting married.

69
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,010
只是为了让他能留在这个国家
It's just so he can stay in the country.

70
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,510
那麽  要是他不走了怎麽办
Now, what if he never leaves?

71
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,510
要是他就这麽一直留在这里怎麽办
What if he becomes a permanent fixture?

72
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,520
要是我的姨妈有蛋蛋怎麽办
What if my aunt had balls?

73
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,920
那他就是我舅舅了
She'd be my uncle.

74
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,830
现在都太迟了  都是我的错
Now it's too late. It's all my fault.

75
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,520
我们什麽都改变不了了
And there's not a goddamn thing we can do about it.

76
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,520
我要坐前座
Shotgun.

77
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,030
就不能让清洁阿姨收拾这些吗？
Can't we leave that for Magdelena?

78
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,530
我们可是付了薪水的
That is why we pay her.

79
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,120
你了解我的
You know me.

80
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,030
东西没收拾好我会睡不着
I can't sleep until everything's put away.

81
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,420
你真龟毛         (亦爱肛交)
You're so anal.

82
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,540
你可幸运了
Lucky for you. Hmm.

83
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,540
小心点  小心点
Careful, careful, careful!

84
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,040
天啊  你这是干嘛
Geez, what was that for?

85
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,550
你陪我度过了我一生中最美好的时光
Well, I don't believe I thanked you properly

86
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,550
我还没好好谢谢你呢
for showing me the best time of my life.

87
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,400
那我也该好好谢谢你
Well, I don't believe I thanked you either...

88
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,050
能让我陪着你
for letting me show you.

89
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,050
真不敢相信泰德竟然会睡着
Could you believe Ted snoring?

90
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,060
我还以为他在盖一间小木屋呢
I thought he was building a log cabin.

91
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,560
这些家伙根本不知道
Those guys have no idea

92
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,060
自由大道外面的世界有多精彩
that there is a world outside of Liberty Avenue.

93
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,060
上星期之前你也不相信啊
Well, you didn't either until last week.

94
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,560
这酒太棒了
This cab is great.

95
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,810
我要再订购一箱
I'm going to order a case of this

96
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,070
招待参议员巴克斯
and serve it for senator Baxter.

97
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,570
你觉得我该邀请他们吗？
Do you think I should've invited them?

98
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,570
谁
Who?

99
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,730
我妈妈  维克叔叔  还有大夥儿
My mom and Uncle Vic, and the guys.

100
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,750
我以为你不想邀请他们
I thought you didn't want to.

101
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,070
我以为你不想让我邀请他们
I thought you didn't want me to.

102
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,430
我说了没事的
I said it'd be fine,

103
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,570
只要布莱恩规规矩矩的就没问题
as long as Brian behaves himself.

104
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,580
你知道的  那些政治募捐者
Oh, you know, political fund-raisers,

105
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,580
我觉得他们不会喜欢同性恋的
I just don't think it's their thing.

106
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,580
巴克斯参议员很支持同性恋
Senator Baxter's very supportive of gay issues.

107
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,580
我觉得一点问题也没有
I would think that's everybody's thing.

108
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,090
但我不...  我不知道在我们那些朋友身边
Yeah, but I don't... I just didn't know if they'd be comfortable

109
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:53,090
他们会不会不自在  他可是个参议员
around our other friends, and a, a state senator.

110
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,570
那麽你做了正确的决定
Then you made the right decision.

111
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,600
所有社团都可以集会  只有我们的不行
Every club is allowed to meet, except ours.

112
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,040
这不公平
It's not fair.

113
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,910
这就是现实  小芙
Welcome to the real world, Daph.

114
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,600
没人会在乎一个「异同联盟」
Nobody gives a shit about a gay-straight alliance.

115
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,110
不是这样的  看看上次有多少人来了
That's not true. Look how many people came.

116
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,560
多少  八个吗
What, eight?

117
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,850
最後只留下了两个  我数了
And two left. I counted.

118
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,550
而且  他们只是为了免费安全套才来的
Besides, they only came 'cause we handed out condoms.

119
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,640
你能相信他现在的状态吗
Can you believe how he was carrying on?

120
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,140
"塞纳河"
"sur la seine."

121
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,380
我差点噎死
I nearly choked on my pate.

122
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,650
他只是有些轻飘飘
He's just dazzled.

123
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,000
让他在超市上几天班
Give him a couple of days back at le grand Mart,

124
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,150
他就会回到现实世界了
He'll come down to earth.

125
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,650
我不知道
I don't know.

126
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,050
自从他和大卫在一起
Ever since he's been with David,

127
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,660
他就像是变了一个人似的
it's like he's got this whole new life.

128
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,160
拜托  我们一起住了两年
Please, he was like, my roommate for two years.

129
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,160
现在我根本就见不到他
Now I never even see him.

130
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,660
我们还得求他一起去酒吧玩
We have to beg him to come out to the bars.

131
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,170
他都不回我电话了
He won't fucking return my calls.

132
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:11,670
天啊  看看这个
Oh, my god! Would you look at that?

133
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:16,170
是谁会开一辆金色的米亚达
Who would drive a gold Miata?

134
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,180
-敞着顶篷                       -在大冬天
- With the top down? - In winter?

135
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,680
你们喜欢这车吗
How do you like it?

136
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,680
这是你的吗
Oh, this is yours?

137
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,680
大卫送给我的
David got it for me.

138
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,180
他  他给你买了一辆车？
He-he bought you a fucking car?

139
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,690
看看车牌
Check out the plates.

140
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,960
星际队长
Captain Astro.

141
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,690
真可爱
That's cute.

142
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,650
你们觉得颜色怎麽样
What do you think of the colour?

143
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:41,200
我有点担心金色会太显眼了
I was worried that the gold might be a tad showy.

144
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,700
谁说不是呢
Oh, you wouldn't want that.

145
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,200
我今早给你打电话了
You know, I called you this morning.

146
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,710
但你没有回我电话
But, uh, you didn't call me back.

147
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,190
我一直很忙
Well, I've been really busy...

148
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,210
想和我们一起去健身房吗
Wanna go to the gym with us?

149
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,710
不行  我得去运动俱乐部找大卫
I can't, I'm meeting David at our sports club.

150
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,720
好吧  你今晚有安排吗
Well, what are you doing tonight?

151
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,220
咱们去伍迪吧玩吧
How about coming out to Woody's with us?

152
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,720
抱歉  我不能去
Sorry, no can do.

153
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,500
我们在法加诺预定了晚餐
We have reservations at Pappagano

154
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,960
和波波还有梅丽桑德一起
with Bobo and Melisande.

155
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,510
波波和梅丽桑德？
Bobo and Melisande?

156
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,730
听起来像是扮装皇后
Sounds like a couple of drag queens.

157
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:15,230
波波是个理专  我们请他帮忙投资
Um, Bobo is a broker. We have our investments with him.

158
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,240
「我们」
"Our".

159
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,240
嗨  宝贝
Hi, honey.

160
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,740
-是        -大卫  大卫
- It's...  - David. David.

161
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,740
是啊  不用担心  我已经拿到了
Yeah, don't worry. I-i just picked them up.

162
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,250
而且我已经和宴会承办人谈过了
And I already spoke to the caterer.

163
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,120
要办派对吗
Having a party?

164
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,750
不过是  几个大卫的朋友  吃个晚饭
It's just... It's just a couple of David's friends, for dinner.

165
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,760
好吧  我该走了
Well, um, I... I better get going.

166
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,760
再见
See you!

167
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,770
-再见      -拜拜
-Ta-ta. - Bye-bye.

168
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:51,770
再见
Ciao!

169
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,780
你觉得怎麽样
So, what do you think?

170
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,290
你像是从电影中走出来的
It's like a movie.

171
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,820
还是恐怖片
A horror movie.

172
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,290
吉拉姆还得把尺寸改改
Guillaume still has to fit it for me.

173
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,790
他很擅长针线活
He's great with a needle and thread.

174
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,290
他有什麽不擅长的吗
Is there anything he can't do?

175
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,290
赢得我朋友的喜爱
Charm my friends.

176
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,990
他有试图赢得我们的喜爱吗
You know, I-I didn't know he was trying.

177
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,800
噢  这不是可可·香奈尔吗
Oh, well if it isn't Coco Chanel.

178
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,040
有客人啊  太幸运了
Company. Aren't we lucky.

179
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,800
你觉得怎麽样
What do you think?

180
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,310
我还得再做些修改
It's going to take a lot of work, but...

181
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,810
不过做完之後你就会美若天仙的
you will be a vision by the time I'm through.

182
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,310
谢谢你  小纪
Thanks, Gui.

183
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:36,310
-我去看看      -是盖斯
-I'll get him. -There's Gus.

184
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,310
没关系  我去吧  他跟我很熟了
Oh, it's all right. He's used to me.

185
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,820
那新郎要穿什麽呢
So what is the groom going to be wearing?

186
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,330
一套很传统很保守的黑礼服
A very conservative, very traditional black tux.

187
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,330
我们不能掉以轻心  婚礼必须像是真的
We can't take any chances, it has to look real.

188
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,830
真是闹剧
This is a fucking farce.

189
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,330
你用不着发脾气吧
Hey, you don't have to lose your temper.

190
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,680
为什麽  你都发神经了
Why not? You've lost your mind.

191
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,980
我从没想过我会穿上婚纱
Well, I never thought I'd see myself in one of these.

192
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,100
虽然我得承认   三不五时
Although now and then, I must admit

193
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,340
我也幻想过成为新娘
I often dreamed of being a bride.

194
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,630
是真的
It's true.

195
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,170
我猜拉拉也免不了有这种幻想
I suppose even dykes can't escape that fantasy.

196
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,330
只是你嫁错人了
Only you're marrying the wrong person.

197
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,850
你从来没有向我求过婚
You never asked me.

198
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,860
我是说茉蕾妮
I mean Melanie.

199
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,840
我没搞错的话
Yeah, last time I checked,

200
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,620
我们是住匹兹堡
we lived in Pittsburgh

201
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,360
而不是佛蒙特州  (此洲允许同性恋结婚)
and not Vermont.

202
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,360
不管怎麽样  现在已经晚了
And anyway, it's too late.

203
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,430
茉儿和我已经完了
Mel and I are finished.

204
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,870
她可不这麽认为
She doesn't think so.

205
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,150
事实上  你是她全部的牵挂
In fact, all she thinks about is you.

206
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,370
她把一切的责任都归咎於自己
She blames herself, for everything.

207
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,380
那麽  她错了
Well, she's wrong.

208
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,380
因为都是我的错
Because it's me.

209
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,090
是我把她从我身边逼走的
'cause I pushed her away.

210
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,490
如果我还爱她  又怎会逼走她呢？
Why would you push away someone you love?

211
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,600
不好意思去了这麽久
Sorry for taking so long.

212
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,390
小家伙真调皮
He was being... very fussy.

213
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,180
那麽  我们是不是该看看礼服了？
Alors,shall we start on the gown?

214
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,870
好的  我要用别针别住这儿
Okay, I just want to pin... here.

215
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,410
一切都被毁坏了  我的画  我的书
Everything was destroyed. My drawings, my books.

216
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,410
你知道是谁干的？
You know who did it?

217
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,410
我猜得到  克里斯·赫伯
I can guess. Chris Hobbs.

218
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,420
我说我们去揍死他
I say we go and beat the shit out of him.

219
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,920
嘿  我们应该提出些建设性的意见
Hey, we're trying to be constructive here.

220
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,210
我觉得我的提议就很有建设性
I thought I was.

221
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,420
你告诉校长了吗
Did you tell the principal?

222
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,740
他才不会管呢
He doesn't care.

223
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,920
都是因为我们组织的那个小团体
It's all because of this group.

224
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,920
什麽小团体
What group?

225
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,610
贾斯汀和达芙妮建立了一个
Justin and Daphne started

226
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,430
「异同学生联盟」
The gay-straight student alliance.

227
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,720
但被他们叫停了
Yeah, but they shut us down.

228
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,430
理由是我们不是正当管道创立的
Said we didn't go through the proper channels.

229
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:38,350
就算你按照规定来  结果也还是一样的
Even if you had, it probably wouldn't have made any difference.

230
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,440
你非得向这孩子泼冷水吗
Do you have to piss on the kid's idealism?

231
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,440
知道这些社会现实对他有好处
He might as well know the truth.

232
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,440
我们只是希望有一个交流的地方
We just wanted a place to talk.

233
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,440
可是连那样也不行
We couldn't even have that.

234
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,280
鉴於现在发生的事
Well, considering what's happened,

235
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,450
或许你不应该
Maybe it's best that you don't...

236
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,950
把自己弄得那麽高调
draw attention to yourself.

237
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,450
你想让我躲躲藏藏的吗
You want me to hide?

238
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,950
我只是希望你能够安全
I want you to be safe.

239
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,450
那我就该直接屈服吗
So I should just give in.

240
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,450
一辈子都受他们的恐吓
Let them intimidate me my entire life.

241
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,960
你要坚持做自己  亲爱的
You stick up for yourself, sunshine.

242
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,460
而你  要坚定地支持他
And you stand beside him.

243
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,460
黛比  你能不能别管这事
Debbie, would you please stay out of this?

244
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,180
我忘了
I forgot.

245
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,470
他只是在我这吃饭睡觉打手枪而已
He just eats, sleeps and jerks off here.

246
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,370
我还是管住我的大嘴巴好了
I'll keep my big mouth shut.

247
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,950
妈  这不仅仅是为了我
Mom, this isn't about me,

248
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,980
也不是因为学校里发生的那些事
or even what happened at school.

249
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,540
这是为了喊出同志的心声
This is about speaking out.

250
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,450
同志应该被了解  不管人们是否愿意倾听
Demanding to be heard, whether people want to hear you or not.

251
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,480
你这些话是从哪儿学来的？
Where'd you learn all that?

252
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,490
你和老爸以前这麽教我的
It's what you and dad taught me.

253
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,830
是吗
We did?

254
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,370
反正圣詹姆斯学院是不可能教他这些的
Well, he sure as hell didn't learn it at the St. James academy.

255
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,940
那麽  你们晚餐吃的怎麽样
So, how was dinner with, uh...

256
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,510
波波  还有  梅丽桑地
Bobo and... Melisand?

257
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,510
是梅丽桑德
Melisande.

258
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,730
梅丽桑德非常幽默  而波波
Melisande's a hoot. And Bobo's like,

259
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,070
则是我见过的最聪明的人
the smartest person I have ever met.

260
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,390
你  你会喜欢他们的
You... You'd love them.

261
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,020
你能不能不要靠在那上面
Um, could you not lean on that?

262
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,420
我刚擦完那块儿
I just got done polishing it.

263
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,530
对不起
Sorry.

264
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:17,530
你为什麽都没有
So why haven't you introduced any of your...

265
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:21,030
把你的新朋友介绍给你的老朋友认识一下
new best friends to any of your old best friends?

266
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,040
没有时间啊
Well, who's had the time?

267
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,040
我们刚从巴黎回来
You know, we just got back from Paris.

268
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,540
你去了巴黎吗  天啊  我都没听说
You went to Paris? God, I hadn't heard.

269
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,050
滚开一点
Fuck off.

270
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,550
是啊   你正希望如此吧
Yeah, maybe you'd like that.

271
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,050
什麽
What?

272
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,420
反正你现在有了全新的上流生活
Now that you've got this fabulous new life...

273
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,700
屁话
That's bullshit.

274
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,050
是吗
Is it?

275
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,190
你漏了一个污点
You missed a spot.

276
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,010
我认识你多久了
How long have I known you?

277
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,240
差不多快一辈子了吧
Like, forever?

278
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,570
我可不认为这是屁话
I don't think it's bullshit.

279
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,150
你可以让一下吗
Could you move, please?

280
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,090
旅行啊  衣服啊  车啊
The trip and the clothes and the car.

281
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,830
都很无趣
They're boring.

282
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,580
你也很无趣
You're boring.

283
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,470
无趣
Boring?

284
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:11,000
我倒觉得我变成了一个很有趣的人
Well, I happen to think I've become a very interesting person.

285
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,090
你他妈的现在纯粹就是个跟屁虫
You've become a fucking little snot.

286
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,090
为什麽  就因为我终於拥有了自己的生活吗
Why? 'cause I finally have a life?

287
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,090
谁的生活  你的吗？
Whose life? Yours?...

288
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,760
还是他的？
Or his?

289
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,610
贾斯汀告诉我在过去的几个月里
Justin tells me that over the past couple of months

290
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:41,620
他遭遇了人身攻击  骚扰  以及辱骂
He's been physically attacked, harassed, called names,

291
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,620
而学校却没有采取任何措施予以制止
and nothing has been done to stop it.

292
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,880
泰勒夫人  我向你保证  如果我知道的话
Well, Mrs. Taylor, I can assure you that had I known about it,

293
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,630
我是绝对不会允许这种情况发生的
I would never have tolerated such behaviour.

294
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:53,130
他还说他试图建立一个社团
Well, he also said that he tried to start a club

295
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,130
目的是为了跨性取向的人们交流
for gay and straight students,

296
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:58,150
而你却禁止他们集会
and you refused to allow them to meet.

297
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,640
正如我们一个老师向贾斯汀解释的那样
As one of the teachers already explained to Justin,

298
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,140
他  社团的建立没有通过正当的管道
He... He didn't go through the proper channels.

299
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,670
所谓正当的管道是指什麽呢
And what are the proper channels?

300
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,610
首先  他必须得到学校校董会的认可
Well, first he would have to get approval from the school board,

301
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:09,980
而我正是校董会的领导者
of which I am the head.

302
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,650
然後他用来集会的教室也必须得到批准
And then he would have to seek approval for a meeting room,

303
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,150
找一个教职员工做指导
find a faculty advisor,

304
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,650
这些步骤贾斯汀都没有遵守
None of which Justin bothered to do.

305
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,210
我敢保证  如果他知道这些程序的话
Well, I'm sure he would've bothered,

306
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,160
他一定会遵守的
had he known.

307
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,150
那麽.. 申请表呢？
So... Where are the forms?

308
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,290
我们现在就可以填
We can fill them out right now.

309
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,570
泰勒夫人  你也知道
Mrs. Taylor, as you know,

310
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,170
圣詹姆斯是所私立学校
St. James is a private academy.

311
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,870
我们不能随便任凭一切毫无节制
We are not required to make allowances for everyone and everything.

312
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,670
这也正是家长们把孩子送进来的原因
That's why parents send their children to this school,

313
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,170
就是为了这里良好的环境
for the special environment.

314
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:41,460
以及一流的教育水平
And for the superior education,

315
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,180
贾斯汀如果肯用心  一样可以享受这些
which Justin is getting, when he puts his mind to it.

316
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,520
这跟我的异同联盟社团有什麽关系？
What does this have to do with having a gay-straight alliance?

317
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:50,190
好吧  如果我允许你建立这个社团
All right, suppose I gave you permission to organize your club.

318
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,190
马上另外一个学生跑过来跟我说
And then another student came to me

319
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,690
要建一个「白人至上」的俱乐部
and asked to start a club for, say, White supremacists.

320
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,190
我是不是也应该允许呢？
Should I allow that too?

321
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,040
不好意思  珀金斯博士
Excuse me, Dr. Perkins,

322
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,200
我觉得这个比喻很侮辱人
But I happen to find that analogy extremely offensive.

323
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,700
我们有些家长很迫切地期望自己子女与众不同
Some of our parents would be hard-pressed to see the distinction.

324
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,700
我则迫切希望看到我儿子被一视同仁
Well, I'm hard-pressed to see the similarity.

325
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,460
不是每个人都能像你那样
Not everyone is as accepting

326
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,710
坦然接受你儿子的性偏好
of your son's sexual preference as you are.

327
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,470
那不是偏好
It's not a preference.

328
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,710
我一开始也觉得难以接受
I was that way at first too.

329
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,220
这更说明了那些人需要学会理解
Which is why it's important that they learn.

330
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,220
泰勒夫人  学校还有更重要的东西要教
Mrs. Taylor, there are more important lessons to be taught here.

331
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,640
比宽容还重要？
Than tolerance?

332
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,030
有人在本地同志报上发现什麽大新闻了吗
Anyone seen a certain hot little item in our local gay rag?

333
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,230
我的广告还在刊登吗
Is my ad still running?

334
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,830
「只要你够大  我就坐得上去？」
"if you've got it, I'll sit on it"?

335
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,500
-这是你的广告词吗     -才不是咧
- Is that you?              - No.

336
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,870
我说的是  这个
I mean... this.

337
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,130
我觉得我从来没有从正面打开过这报纸
You know, I don't think I've ever opened this paper from the front.

338
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:51,170
「议员戴安·巴克斯的资金筹集会」
"Fundraiser for state senator Diane Baxter will be held

339
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,600
「将在大卫·卡梅隆医生和」
at the home of Dr. David Cameron and

340
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,250
「迈克·瓦特尼先生家举行」
Mr.Michael Novotny."

341
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,250
什麽  快让我看看
What? Let me see that.

342
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,760
嘿  我们点的餐好了吗
Hey, can we have our food?

343
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,860
先吃面包吧
Eat the bread.

344
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,260
噢  天啊
Oh, my god!

345
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,260
我儿子步入上流社会了
Oh, my baby's in high society.

346
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,290
现在我们的女主人一身光鲜地走进来了
Oh, and here's the hostess with the mostess.

347
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:13,770
你怎麽没有跟我说这事
Why didn't you tell me about this?

348
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,770
要招待一个参议员
Entertaining a senator!

349
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,980
天啊  你现在是一个社交女王了  小迈
God, you're a society lady now, Mikey.

350
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,280
你最好别向她展示你们在巴黎拍的照片
I hope you don't show her those slides from Paris.

351
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,280
这只不过是大卫办的一场小聚会而已
That's just a little thing that David's throwing.

352
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,780
我想他大概给她做过脊椎矫正
I think he gave the senator an adjustment once, or something.

353
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,740
我们点的东西还没有好吗
Could we please have our food?

354
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,510
这是沙拉   又不会变凉
It's salad. It's not going to get cold.

355
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,290
糟糕  穿什麽衣服见议员合适
Oh, shit! What do you wear to meet a senator?

356
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,790
我觉得我应该穿我那件
Oh, I think I'm going to wear my, um,

357
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,790
那件橘色西装  还有那条石灰绿的领带
my orange suit, and my new lime green tie.

358
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,300
彰显朴素的一面  这麽穿绝对没错
Oh, understated, yeah. That's definitely the way to go.

359
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,300
你打算穿什麽  布莱恩
How about you, Brian?

360
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,300
阿玛尼？  杰尼亚？  还是普拉达？
A little Armani? Zegna? Prada?

361
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,910
穿个屁
Nada.

362
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,300
我又没被邀请
I wasn't invited.

363
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,810
你当然被邀请了  我们都会被邀请的
Of course you're invited. We're all invited.

364
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,810
-是吧  宝贝          -那聚会非常无聊的
-Right, honey?  -Well, it's going to be really stuffy.

365
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,890
你知道的…无聊透顶
You know, no fun at all.

366
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,750
而且  你们还必须捐赠..
And you have to make a contribution...

367
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,900
那又怎样  能见议员一面多不容易
So? I mean, how often do you get to meet a senator?

368
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,290
你还得工作呢
Well, you have to work.

369
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,480
我可以请假啊
I'll take it off.

370
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,650
听着  这就不是你的场合  好吗？
Look, this just isn't your thing, okay?

371
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,110
所以别闹了
So just drop it.

372
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,250
现在可以给我一份外带火鸡肉卷吗？
Now can I please get the turkey meatloaf to go?

373
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,330
好的  宝贝
Okay, sweetie.

374
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:19,450
让我为那位先生上完餐
Uh, just let me serve this man his dinner.

375
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,340
我得去趟洗手间
I gotta go to the washroom.

376
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,850
所以  泰德  作为我的会计师
Say, Ted, as my accountant,

377
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,850
你觉得我花点「政治献金」的钱如何？
what do you think about increasing my political contributions?

378
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,340
我真应该再次感谢你  大卫
And I do have to thank you again, David,

379
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,870
让我们参观你美丽的家
for opening up your beautiful home to us.

380
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,370
我应该谢谢您才对  议员
Well, thank you, senator,

381
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,870
感谢您长期来支持同志权利的立法
for your ongoing commitment to progay legislation.

382
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,380
相信我  如果我能对此多尽点力
Oh, believe me, if I have anything to do with it,

383
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,880
而且我正打算全力以赴
and I intend to,

384
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,880
将来你和迈克就可以在这里举行婚礼了
you and Michael will be celebrating your wedding reception right here.

385
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,380
让我们为此乾一杯
Let's drink to that.

386
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,890
不好意思
Now if you'll excuse me,

387
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:15,210
我应该...做些例行公事
I should, um... do what I'm supposed to do at these affairs,

388
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,390
竭力争取些捐款
and drum up some donations.

389
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,390
-祝你好运     -谢谢
-Good luck.   -Thank you.

390
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,620
我们上次参加的派对  我们看了
The last party I was at, we watched

391
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,480
「我不管你们去年夏天干了些什麽」  (惊声尖叫)
"I don't give a shit what you did last summer"

392
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,940
配啤酒和玉米片
and ate beer and nachos.

393
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,400
现在你喝着香槟 吃着鱼子酱馅饼
Now you're drinking champagne eating caviar tarts

394
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,250
招待参议员
and entertaining a senator.

395
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,230
希望我们没来得太迟
I hope we're not too late.

396
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,310
我可不希望错过什麽
I'd hate to miss the crudities.

397
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:36,740
糟了
Oh, shit.

398
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:42,420
天哪  这像在守丧  谁死了？
Jesus. This looks like a wake. Who died?

399
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,420
你们来这里做什麽？
What are you doing here?

400
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,930
亲爱的  我们绝不会错过你们的宴会
Well, we wouldn't have missed your party for the world, sweetheart.

401
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,430
我想我们的邀请函寄丢了
Yeah, we figure our invitation got lost in the mail.

402
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,430
该死的邮政系统啊
Damn that postal service.

403
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,930
我要写给我的参议员投诉
I'm going to write my senator.

404
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:59,040
不用了  她就在这里
You don't have to. She's here.

405
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,940
这是私人慈善活动  你们不能就这样闯进来
This is a private benefit. You can't just break in.

406
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,940
「闯进来」吗？
"Break in"?

407
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,440
我们是你家人  又不是强盗
We're family, not bandits.

408
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,440
医生 这是一张小支票
Here's a little cheque, doc.

409
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,020
我想足够应付我们所有人的份了
I think it should be enough to cover all of us.

410
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,250
小迈  领带不错啊
Nice tie, Mikey.

411
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,450
借过一下
'scuse me.

412
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,450
要嚐个馅饼吗？
Care to try a tart?

413
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,450
-鸡尾酒呢？  -两三杯吧
-Cocktail?  - Or two or three.

414
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,960
大卫  真对不起
I'm so sorry, David.

415
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,240
我真的没想到他们会不请自来
I can't believe that they would show up uninvited.

416
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,100
当巴克斯参议员看到捐款的数目
I don't think senator Baxter is going to mind

417
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,050
应该就不会介意了
when she sees the size of that contribution.

418
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,830
音乐真他妈难听
This music sucks dick.

419
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,790
这叫融合爵士乐
I believe it's jazz fusion.

420
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,110
物理学上  核融合应该要引起爆炸
Yeah, in physics a fusion is supposed to cause a blast.

421
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,060
就像...
Like...

422
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,980
这种！
this!

423
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,990
想跳舞吗？
You want to dance?

424
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,560
我不会跳舞
I don't dance.

425
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,450
现在你会啦
You do now.

426
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,800
谢谢你们的支持
Thanks for your support.

427
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,510
巴克斯参议员吗？
Senator Baxter?

428
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,510
对  我就是
Yes, I am.

429
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,010
我在《出柜》杂志上看过你
Oh, I saw you in "OUT".

430
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,510
我是黛比．瓦特尼
I'm Debbie Novotny.

431
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,010
你好
Hello.

432
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,020
这是我弟弟维克
And this is my brother Vic.

433
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,520
-你好             -你好
- How do you do?  -Hello.

434
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,520
我是迈克的妈妈
I'm Michael's mother.

435
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,420
你知道   我们的女主人
You know, our host.

436
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,330
他的确是个很有魅力的年轻人
Yes, and a very charming young man he is.

437
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,030
我们以前也这麽认为
We used to think so.

438
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,980
天呐  他们围住了参议员
Oh my god, they've cornered the senator.

439
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,530
我们得去救她
We have to save her.

440
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,030
迈克  她是政治人物
She's a politician, Michael.

441
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,530
她有办法为自己解围的
She can talk her way out of anything.

442
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,440
嗨  你好吗？
Hey, how are you doing?

443
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,920
我能帮你弄杯喝的吗？
Can I get you a drink?

444
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,530
想跳舞吗？
Care to dance?

445
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,560
我对皮衣没有兴趣
Huh... I'm not into leather.

446
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,560
我以前也不是啊
Hey, you know, neither was I.

447
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,060
但後来我碰到一个老同学
Then I ran into this old school friend

448
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,560
他把我绑在地下室里 让我当他的性奴
who shackled me in his dungeon and made me his suck-pig.

449
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,970
黑色和蓝色...只适合瘀青
Black and blue, it's... it's fine for bruises, boys,

450
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:28,200
参加宴会需要穿鲜艳一点的颜色
but when you come to a party, you need a little colour.

451
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,590
你...我的天  谁帮你挑衣服的？
Ha, now, you... Oh my lord, w-who dressed you, honey?

452
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,590
莫蒂西亚．亚当斯吗 （老电影角色）
Morticia Addams? Huh.

453
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,090
来  转过去
Here, turn around.

454
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:37,590
看  你本来有个很翘的丰臀
See, now you have a fabulous bubble-butt.

455
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,590
但是如果你不露出来的话
But it's not going to do you any good

456
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,600
是没人会发现的
if you don't show it off.

457
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,100
你也是  脱掉外套  让我们看看
You too. Jackets off, let's see those bods.

458
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,100
脱吧
Come on.

459
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,600
快脱  快点  快点
Come on, chop, chop.

460
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,610
这位小姐可是个流浪汉
This lady is a tramp,

461
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,110
而今晚杰克不是唯一幸运的人    （小姐与流浪汉）
and tonight Jack's not the only one getting lucky.

462
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,610
来吧
Come on.

463
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,620
好吧
Oh, man. All right.

464
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:06,620
好吧  好吧
Ooh, okay, all right, all right.

465
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,620
没事的
All right.

466
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,620
我们给妈咪打电话
We'll call mommy.

467
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:16,130
喂？
Hello?

468
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:19,100
嗨  是我
Hi, it's me.

469
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,630
我知道很晚了
I know it's late.

470
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,640
你没事吧？
Is everything all right?

471
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,140
是盖斯  他在闹脾气
It's Gus. He's in one of his moods.

472
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:29,140
我了解他的脾气
Oh. I remember his moods.

473
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,650
只有你才知道怎麽哄他
Look, you're the one with the magic touch.

474
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,150
可以吗？
Would you mind?

475
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:37,150
在电话上哄吗？
Over the phone?

476
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:39,710
我绝望了  什麽都试试吧
I'm desperate. I'll try anything.

477
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,760
听着
Here you go.

478
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:36,210
-有用吗？         -像魔咒一样
-Did that work?   -Like a charm.

479
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:40,210
他还是唯一一个欣赏你歌声的人
He's still the only one who appreciates your singing.

480
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,720
什麽？  我声音很好听的
What? I have a lovely voice.

481
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,220
你常常走音
You can barely carry a tune.

482
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:48,220
-才不是呢           -明明就是
- That's not true.  - Yeah, it is.

483
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,220
其实是的
Yeah, it is.

484
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,730
谢谢帮忙
Listen, thanks for helping.

485
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:57,730
晚安
'night.

486
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,730
晚安
'night.

487
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,300
布莱恩
Brian.

488
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,800
别担心  我只是带他参观一下
Don't worry, I'm just giving him a tour

489
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,300
你这...可爱的家
of your... Lovely home.

490
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,310
大卫  非常对不起
David, I'm so sorry.

491
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,310
为什麽？
Why?

492
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,810
我没听见任何人抱怨
I don't hear anyone complaining.

493
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,820
我说  一脚踹在共和党员的蛋蛋上
I say kick those republicans right in the balls.

494
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,820
只是他们连蛋没有而已   (没胆量)
Only they haven't got any.

495
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,020
我的老天！
Oh my god!

496
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,830
妈  能不能别再霸着参议员了？
Ma, could you, um, stop monopolizing the senator?

497
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:36,330
-戴安  不好意思        -戴安？
- I'm sorry, Diane...  - "Diane"?

498
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:39,330
迈克  你妈是个了不起的女人
Michael, your mother is a remarkable woman.

499
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,840
大卫  我参加过很多募款活动
You know, David, I attend a lot of fundraisers.

500
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,340
我是说  大家都是出於好意
And I mean, everybody means well,

501
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,840
但我得说  那些活动都非常无聊
but I got to tell you, they're usually very boring things.

502
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,340
可是这个就很有趣  我玩得挺开心
Not this one, I'm having a ball.

503
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,350
妈  我能跟你说句话吗？
Ma, um, can I talk to you for a second?

504
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,850
当然了  亲爱的
Sure, sweetie.

505
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:56,350
戴安  失陪一下
'scuse me, Diane. Mm-hmm.

506
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,350
小阳光  过来
Hey, sunshine, come here.

507
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,850
跟戴安讲讲你创立的社团
Tell Diane about the club you started.

508
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,360
这是一个非常勇敢的孩子
This is one goddamn brave kid.

509
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,860
我很喜欢他  跟她聊吧
I love him. Talk to her.

510
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,860
你好
How do you do?

511
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,370
把那个端高些
Carry that a little higher.

512
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,370
好了走吧  就这样
There you go, sweetie, that's it.

513
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:14,870
专业礼仪
Professional courtesy.

514
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:19,370
你怎麽敢这样对我？还有大卫？
How dare you do this to me? And to David.

515
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,880
我做了什麽？  我只是和戴安聊天而已
Do what? I was just talking to Diane.

516
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,380
你知道她曾经当过服务生吗？
Do you know that she worked as a waitress?

517
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,880
为了照顾她的家人
To take care of her family.

518
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,380
她只是出於礼貌而已
She was just being polite.

519
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,880
礼貌？
Polite?

520
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,890
你真的单纯地认为她想
Do you actually think she wanted to

521
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,390
花一整个晚上跟你一个人聊天吗？
spend her entire evening talking to you?

522
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,890
好吧  又不是我一直死缠着她
Well, it's not as if I nailed her to the floor.

523
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,620
我认为你们都应该离开
I think you should all leave.

524
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,900
我们刚来时 这个宴会死气沉沉
This party was a stinker when we got here.

525
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,340
你应该好好感谢我们才对
You should be thanking us.

526
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,400
感谢你们让我难堪吗？
For embarrassing the hell out of me?

527
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:00,840
我知道有时候我让人很难接受
You know, I know I'm hard to take. Sometimes.

528
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,920
过分的玩笑  夸张的打扮
Hmm? My jokes, and my appearance,

529
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,230
还有过度热情
and my enthusiasm.

530
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,370
我还知道你有时以我为耻
And I know that sometimes you're ashamed of me.

531
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,430
但是没关系  我是你老妈
And that's okay. I'm your mother,

532
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:16,920
我可以忍受
And it's part of the deal.

533
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,930
但是  迈克...
But, Michael...

534
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:27,180
我从没想过 我居然会有以你为耻的一天
I never thought the day would come that I would be ashamed of you.

535
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,490
你什麽意思  这里没卖白桃？
What do you mean, you don't have any white peaches?

536
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,540
喔  这里是匹兹堡
Oh, Pittsburgh.

537
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,510
他甚至负责买菜了
He even does the shopping.

538
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,510
盖斯  看看谁来了  你的精子捐献者
Ah, look who's here Gus, your sperm donor.

539
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,510
你还以为他有工作呢
And you thought he had a job.

540
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,510
这叫「午休时间」
It's called "lunch break". Mm-hmm.

541
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:41,830
你知道吗  不该把没洗过的东西放进嘴里
You know, you shouldn't put things in your mouth that aren't washed.

542
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,020
你们法国人  真是卫生
You French, so hygienic.

543
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,240
-我愿意冒险             -随便你
-I'll take my chances.  -As you wish.

544
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,950
当然了  你习惯冒险的生活
Of course, you're used to living at risk.

545
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,530
你现在才是在冒险呢
Well, you know, you're taking quite a risk yourself.

546
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,690
事实上  只要有人愿意
In fact, if someone wanted to,

547
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,030
他们随时都可以检举你
they could report you.

548
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:01,570
是...我会有麻烦
Yes... It would be trouble for me.

549
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,040
我会被遣送回法国
I could be sent back to France.

550
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,040
但是琳赛会更惨
But it'd be far worse for Lindsay.

551
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,540
她会进监狱吧
She could be sent to jail,

552
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,030
那里可不是蔚蓝海岸（旅游圣地）
which is not exactly the Cote d'Azur.

553
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,470
你真的不应该那样做
You know, you really shouldn't do that.

554
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,050
相信我  我也试过劝她
Oh, I tried stopping her, believe me.

555
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,550
但是她不听  你也知道她很善良
But she won't hear of it. You know what a big heart she has.

556
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,030
你觉得这个如何？
What do you think?

557
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,050
是晚饭要吃还是你自己用？
Well, is it for dinner or for you?

558
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,560
-宝贝  来这儿           -不  不行
-Come here, sonny-boy.  -Ah, no-no-no.

559
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,560
我得回家做普罗旺斯炖菜
I have to get home to start my ratatouille.

560
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:28,060
去你的炖菜 把我的孩子给我
Fuck your ratatouille. Give me my kid,

561
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,560
否则我会用那栉瓜捅你菊花
Or I'll shove that zucchini up your ass.

562
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,060
好  好吧
Okay, okay.

563
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,570
嘿 那是什麽？
Hey, what is it?

564
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,070
只能抱一分钟
Just for a minute

565
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:41,070
我知道  你说对了  他身上臭臭
I know, you're right. He smells.

566
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:45,080
多希望我能用相机拍下这罕见的画面
Well, I wish I had a picture to capture this rare moment.

567
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,580
你刚听到什麽了吗？
Did you hear something?

568
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,580
一旦琳赛和我结婚了
You know, once Lindsay and I are married,

569
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,090
我们需要你跟我们保持距离
We'll need you to keep your distance.

570
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:53,970
为什麽这麽说？
Why is that?

571
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,980
我们要考虑别人的观感
Well, we've got to think about appearances.

572
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:00,090
我甚至想收养盖斯
I'm even thinking of adopting Gus.

573
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,100
那样的话 一切会圆满而且合法
In that way everything would be nice and legal.

574
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:11,100
好了  来吧孩子  给我抱抱（法语）
Alors! tu viens ici, mon petit. Tu viens ici, mon petit.

575
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,080
恐同人士闪边去
Homophobia's got to go.

576
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,120
恐同人士闪边去
Homophobia's got to go.

577
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,130
恐同人士闪边去
Homophobia's got to go.

578
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:36,130
恐同人士闪边去
Homophobia's got to go.

579
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,160
这是怎麽回事？
What's going on here?

580
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,650
我们在抗议圣詹姆斯学院
We're protesting St. James academy's

581
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:54,150
学生社团政策的不公不义
bigoted policy on student clubs.

582
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:56,530
泰勒  我已经受够这些了
Taylor, I have had just about enough of this.

583
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:59,150
这是集会自由  老兄
It's called freedom of assembly, pal.

584
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:02,160
这里是私人财产  你们现在是非法侵入
This is private property. And you're all trespassing.

585
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,160
我去叫警察
I'm calling the police.

586
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,420
你得留下来听听这个
You might want to stick around for this.

587
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:15,170
贾斯汀．泰勒想成立一个社团
Justin Taylor tried to organize a club

588
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:17,770
让不同性倾向的学生
to promote tolerance and understanding

589
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,390
增进对彼此的宽容和理解
between gay and straight students.

590
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,180
他的努力却白费了
His attempt was denied on the basis

591
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:25,680
因为圣詹姆斯学院自称是私校
that St. James academy is a private institution

592
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,680
而不愿广纳听取学生的意见
and isn't required to acknowledge the voices of all its students.

593
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:33,690
如果私学还期待得到政府经费的支持
Well, if private schools expect to receive public dollars,

594
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:36,190
那我们得期待这所学校还给各学子们
then we can expect them to uphold the same values

595
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:38,480
应有自由和公民权利
of freedom and civil rights

596
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,690
这些正是我国民的基本人权
on which this country is based.

597
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,200
给他们好看  小戴
Give them hell, Di.

598
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:16,730
我喜欢这照片
I love that picture.

599
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:19,730
是啊
Yeah.

600
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,800
爸爸和乖儿子
Dada and sonny-boy.

601
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,510
好吧  我是个糟糕的爸爸
Ahh, all right, so I'm a shitty father.

602
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,250
意外吗？
Are we surprised?

603
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,420
我竟然保持着优良的家族传统
I'm upholding a fine family tradition.

604
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,260
你不是一个糟糕的爸爸
You're not a shitty father.

605
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,650
你爱盖斯
You love Gus.

606
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,730
还以为我不会呢  真奇怪
Didn't think I would. It's strange.

607
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:58,770
奇怪除了自己以外  居然还有你在乎的人？
Knowing there's someone else you care about besides yourself?

608
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:01,270
给我来一点
Give me some.

609
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,780
你这年纪抽烟已经够糟了
It's bad enough you smoke at your age.

610
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,780
「我这年纪？」
"At my age?"

611
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,780
布莱恩  我是你认识的人之中最成熟的
Brian, I'm the most mature person you know.

612
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:22,300
你觉得盖斯会先开口说法文吗？
Think Gus is going to speak French before he speaks English?

613
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,800
你怎麽不去睡？
Why don't you go to bed?

614
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,800
琳赛不能自己养大孩子
Well, Lindsay can't raise him on her own.

615
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,850
即使你这麽爱他
And as much as you love him,

616
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,460
你也永远不会成为全职家长
you're never going to be a full-time parent.

617
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:36,810
如果我想知道新闻  我会看CNN
You know, if I wanted the news, I'd watch CNN.

618
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:40,310
你无法控制所有人的生活
You can't control everyone's life,

619
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,180
即使你想这麽做
even though you'd like to.

620
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,820
显然如此
Obviously.

621
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,320
你还赖在这儿
You're still here.

622
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:59,830
对我冷嘲热讽是没用的
Being mean to me has never really worked.

623
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,840
你应该试别的方法
You should try another tactic.

624
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:15,850
你在干什麽？
What're you doing?

625
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:19,850
我在用温柔秒杀你
I'm killing you with kindness.

626
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,360
经过证实  这是一个非常有效的方法
It's proven to be a highly effective technique

627
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,360
可以让人达到...自己的目的
for achieving... one's goals.

628
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,380
-他的玩具呢？             -在包包里
- Do you have his toys?  -They're in the bag.

629
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,390
我的钥匙呢？
Where are my keys?

630
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:02,400
拜托快点  离预约时间只剩20分钟了
Please, please hurry up. The appointment's in 20 minutes.

631
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,900
我知道时间  太好了  在这
I know when the appointment is. Oh, god, here they are.

632
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,400
我的天
Oh,merde.

633
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,500
来的真是时候
It's all we need.

634
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,410
好了  你得弄走他们
Okay, y-you have to get rid of them.

635
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:16,300
-好吧  让开 让开          -好的
-All right, move, move.   -D'accord.

636
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,910
听着  我们赶时间
I... Look, we're in a hurry.

637
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,190
我发誓我不知道他会带我来这
I-I swear I had no idea he was bringing me over here.

638
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:24,560
-我们要走了          -他说你出事了
-We have to leave.   -He said you had an accident.

639
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,920
-出事           -这是唯一的方法了
- An accident?  -It was the only way.

640
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,790
能改天再说吗  我们要迟到了
May we save this for some other time?  We're late.

641
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:30,920
你是不是要出门  皮耶尔？
Are you going somewhere, Pierre?

642
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,430
去领结婚证书  如果你们不介意的话...
To get our marriage license. So, if you'll excuse us...

643
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:34,630
一会就好
Well, this will just take a minute.

644
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:36,840
不行不行  我们真的...
Non, non.We really must...

645
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,430
坐下  闭嘴
Sit down and shut up.

646
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:39,930
-你说什麽？  -坐下
- Excuse me? - Sit down.

647
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:40,930
好吧
All right.

648
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,440
什麽事？
What is it?

649
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,170
好  现在我不想再听到什麽
Okay, I don't want to hear any more shit

650
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:49,340
「这是我的错」
about "this is my fault."

651
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,940
「不  这是我的错」
"No, this is my fault."

652
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,950
「都怪我」  「不  都怪我」
"I'm to blame." "No, I'm to blame."

653
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:54,290
「抱歉」
"I'm sorry."

654
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:55,450
「不  我才抱歉」之类的屁话
"no, I'm sorry."

655
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,450
但的确是我的错
But it really is my fault.

656
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:58,450
不  茉儿  是我的错
No, Mel, it was my fault.

657
00:35:58,450 --> 00:35:59,450
全部都是...不不不
All along it was... No, no, no.

658
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:00,450
是我的错  相信我
It was my fault, trust me.

659
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,820
我做心理治疗的时候想通了
I worked this all out in therapy.

660
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,450
我也是...
And so did I...

661
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:03,950
我说了闭嘴
I said shut up.

662
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,820
去你的心理治疗
And fuck therapy.

663
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,970
这东西才是关键
This is the only thing that matters.

664
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:18,470
那是什麽？
What's that?

665
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,970
是我的监护权
It's my parental rights.

666
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,470
我已经签名转让给你
I've signed them over to you.

667
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,010
我的天啊
Oh, my god.

668
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,980
布莱恩...
Brian...

669
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,480
你确定吗？
Are you sure?

670
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,300
我不确定的话还会签好吗？
Would I be doing this if I wasn't?

671
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:35,490
但是为什麽？
But why?

672
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:37,990
我儿子需要有一对永远在他身边的双亲
Well, my son deserves two parents who'll be there for him

673
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,530
爱着他
and love him.

674
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,860
也彼此相爱
and who love each other.

675
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,500
而让这些事发生的唯一方法
So the only way this deal works

676
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,520
就是你们重修旧好
is if the two of you get back together.

677
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,510
那是什麽  算是贿赂吗？
Well, what is this, some kind of a bribe?

678
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,560
你可以这麽想
You could look at it that way.

679
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:01,540
或者想成一份慷慨的礼物
Or you can think of it as a very generous gift.

680
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,530
但如果你不想...
But if you don't want it...

681
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,960
你还爱我吗？
Do you still love me?

682
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:16,230
我从未停止过
I never stopped.

683
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,540
你觉得呢？
What do you think?

684
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,540
我同意
Yeah.

685
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,520
好  抢答时间结束
Okay, lightning round's over.

686
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,360
你们的回答是？
Do I hear an answer?

687
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,510
我们同意！
Yes. Yes!

688
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,050
我爱你
I love you.

689
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:44,560
天啊  你们可是拉拉  坚强点
God, you're dykes for Christ' sake. Toughen up.

690
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,430
我爱你
I love you.

691
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,780
我爱你
I love you.

692
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,480
那我怎麽办？
And what about me?

693
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:00,070
小纪...
Oh, Gui...

694
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,570
对不起
I'm sorry.

695
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,090
说再见  盖斯
Say au revoir, Gus.

696
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,600
黛比  这太棒了！
Oh, Debbie, this is fabulous!

697
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,030
太好了
Oh, good.

698
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,100
对了  罗马诺乾酪！  小阳光
Oh, romano! uh, sunshine,

699
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:32,100
宝贝  给我们拿点罗马诺乾酪好吗？
Honey, get us some romano, would you, baby?

700
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,610
恐怕那不像我儿子提供的
I'm... I'm afraid it's not as fancy as those little

701
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:36,380
那些鱼子酱之类的东西那麽高级
caviar things my son was serving...

702
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,350
普通人  和参议员
Well, man, and senators,

703
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,610
都不能只靠鱼子酱过活
cannot live on little caviar things alone.

704
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,120
多谢了
Oh, thanks.

705
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,120
真是太可惜了 迈克不能加入我们
It's too bad, um, Michael couldn't join us.

706
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,620
近来  回他妈妈这里吃义大利面
Well, these days, coming over to his mother's

707
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,120
和喝廉价的酒  不是他的风格
for pasta and vino isn't his style.

708
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,630
我确定他有别的事
I'm sure he had other plans.

709
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:56,130
对啊  比如和波波吃晚饭
Yeah, like dinner with Bobo.

710
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:57,890
还有梅丽桑德
And Melisande.

711
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,610
去他的
Well, fuck him.

712
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,640
抱歉  参议员
Oh, sorry, senator.

713
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,140
没关系
Oh, it's okay.

714
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,640
我自己也用那个词
I've used that word myself,

715
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,870
通常在後面加上「小布希」
usually followed by Bush.

716
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,650
我要为此乾杯
I'll drink to that.

717
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:15,150
让我们一同为乾杯吧
Oh, hell, let's all drink to that.

718
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,650
先让我敬个酒吧
Let me make a toast, please.

719
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,650
首先  敬我们超棒的女主人
First of all, to our wonderful hostess.

720
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,150
-黛比     -谢谢你
- Debbie. - Thank you.

721
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,160
黛比  敬黛比
Debbie! Deb! to Deb.

722
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,660
这杯酒敬你  老姐
Here's to you, sis.

723
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:27,470
还有庆祝一下小小的胜利
And to little victories.

724
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:29,080
因为至少  珀金斯博士同意
At least, uh, Dr. Perkins has agreed

725
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,660
把你的请求送到学校董事会了
to take your request to the school board.

726
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,230
多谢了  巴克斯议员
Thanks, senator Baxter.

727
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,610
坐吧
Have a seat.

728
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,690
我不能...我不能留下来
I can't... I can't stay.

729
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:56,690
你不能？
You can't?

730
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:58,010
还是你不想？
Or you don't want to?

731
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,840
你吃过了吗？
You eaten?

732
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,030
没有
No.

733
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,100
那就拿个椅子坐
So pull up a chair.

734
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,910
小阳光？
Sunshine?

735
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:20,710
你能给迈克拿点义大利面吗  宝贝？
Will you get Michael some puttenesca, honey?

736
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,760
你个小混蛋
You little asshole.

737
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,240
对不起  小戴
Sorry, Di.

738
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,240
没关系  那个词我也用过
Oh, it's okay. I've used that one too.

739
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,700
事情都解决了  从此幸福快乐
So it all worked out, happily ever after.

740
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,330
多亏了参议员
Thanks to the senator.

741
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,960
不要自欺欺人
Yeah, don't kid yourself.

742
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:39,290
那女人在利用你  为了钱和选票
That woman is using you, for money and for votes.

743
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:42,090
她会继续寻找她下一个目标
She'll move on to her next cause,

744
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:43,300
他的下一个募款人
her next fund-raiser,

745
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,710
那个时候你算老几？
Then where will you be?

746
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,650
她说这是个小小的胜利
She said it's a small victory.

747
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,300
别以为你已经胜利了
Well, don't think you've won,

748
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,320
那叫做结束
That it's over.

749
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:57,310
因为以後你只要一不小心
'cause the minute you do that,

750
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:59,310
你就死定了
You're dead.

751
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:18,830
不会的   我要有你保护着
Not as long as I've got you to protect me. .
