Then a coffee,

<i>Oh London

00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,760
<i>Lost along your dusty, musty</i>

<i>Streets and tunnels</i>

34
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,680

00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,240
<i>Find the band.</i>

36
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,720
Two teams, two A to Zs,
and two hours to hunt for clues.

37
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,920
Somewhere in these famous streets,
an even more famous band is hiding.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,440
And the first team to find them
wins all the swag.

39
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,640
So that's it. Get to it.

40
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,280

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,400
Sorry. Uh, the tube.

47
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,240
The tube? The tube?

48
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,640
Hola, everyone!

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,920
Hola.

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Hola, everyone.

51
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,320
Hola.

52
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,760
Come on.
People don't just come for the food.

53
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,840
It's the atmosphere as well.

54
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,280
- Hola!
- Hola.

55
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,200
Imagine coming for the food.

56
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,160
A thought for those
who come for atmosphere.

57
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,520
Before we open the doors,

58
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,960
I'd like to go through today's specials,
if I may.

59
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,240
So we've got a tuna enchilada
and a turkey chimichanga.

60
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,120
Mm. Turkey. In July.

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,880
Paddy, I've checked the rota.
You're on toilets.

62
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,560
- What? It's Emma's turn.
- Not today.

63
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,320
Emma, this is Ian. New boy.

64
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,440
Yo, my people.

65
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,960
Jesus. Where does she find them?

66
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,960
Emma, I'd like you to show him the ropes
'cause you've been here the longest.

67
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,600
Welcome to the graveyard of ambition.

68
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,840
<i>Loco Caliente</i> means "crazy hot."

69
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,560
"Hot," the air conditioning doesn't work.

70
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,920
"Crazy" 'cause that's
what you'd have to be to eat here.

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,160
Or work here, for that matter.
Twenty minutes for lunch.

72
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,640
You can have anything from the menu,
but I strongly urge you don't.

73
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,960
This is your locker. It doesn't lock,

74
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,240
so don't put anything in it
that you're in any way attached to.

75
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,640
And familiarize yourself
with the Heimlich maneuver.

76
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,680
There's a surprising amount of choking.

77
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,560
Oh. And once a shift,
someone tries to ride that donkey,

78
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,080
so keep an eye out.

79
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,760
- So, Ian, what brings you down Mexico way?
- Gotta pay the rent.

80
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,200
Sorry?

81
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,720
Uh, I... I need flexible hours.

82
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,160
- Oh. Why's that?
- I'm a comedian.

83
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,640
- Are you?
- Yeah.

84
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,200
Stand-up, mainly.

85
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,080
A bit of improv.

86
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,560
- What about you?
- What about me?

87
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,960
What's your stroke?

88
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,520
Waiter stroke stand-up?
Barman stroke model?

89
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,696
- Did Paddy tell you he's a model?
- Let me guess.

90
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,160
Paddy is <i>not</i> a model.

91
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,240
- Uh, you're a musician?
- Uh-uh.

92
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,680
- Tone-deaf.
- Actress.

93
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,120
Mercifully, no longer.

94
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,760
Oh. I've got it.
You're a writer, aren't you?

95
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,360
Not in any meaningful sense.

96
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,000
If you write, you're a writer.

97
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,360
Yeah. I'm not really sure
it works like that.

98
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,000
So, do you like it here?

99
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,080
Like it?

100
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,280
I bloody love it. I'm not made of wood.

101
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,200
Salsa, guacamole, sour cream.

102
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,280
- Doesn't it need to be kept in the fridge?
- Oh. That's not real cream.

103
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,640
- What is it?
- Some sort of hydrogenated fat, I think.

104
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,640
Basically, what's left over
when they make petrol.

105
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,520
- What's happening?
- "The Cucaracha."

106
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,400
Four times an hour, 32 times a shift.

107
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,960
Pa-pa-pa, ta-ta-da, cha-cha-cha!

108
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,320
Well done, guys.
Come on, amigos. Shaky, shaky.

109
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,000
Yeah. That's it, Ian.

110
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,400
Now the turn.

111
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,960
Round and round,
and pa-pa-pa, cha-cha-cha.

112
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,280
Footwork.

113
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,760
Ian, come on. Emma.

114
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,800
Turn, Ian. Turn. Please. Come on.

115
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,840
There she is.

116
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,040
Big hug.

117
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,600
Don't hug me. I'm disgusting.

118
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,240
Mm.

119
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,656
- Am I not seeing you later?
- Can't stay away.

120
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,600
Em, come and... meet Naomi.

121
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,960
It's spelled Naomi, but pronounced "Nomi."

122
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,400
Hi, Nom... i.

123
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,760
And this is
my very dear friend, Emma.

124
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,840
Hi.

125
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,480
Dex, why are you here?

126
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,800
We were just down the road, filming.

127
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,280
Nonbroadcast pilot, not for TX.

128
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,720
- More of a taster tape.
- No idea what that means.

129
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,120
- Yeah, but you were good, though.
- Ah?

130
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,400
You <i>know</i> you were good.
The camera loves you.

131
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,000
- But do I love the camera?
- I'm guessing that you do.

132
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,600
Can I get you guys something to eat?

133
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,040
Oh no, we're not eating. We're not eating.

134
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,680
This is Ian.

135
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,280
Hi, Ian.

136
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,680
Uh, may we have
three of the Day of the Dead margaritas?

137
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,560
I can't, Dex. I'm working.

138
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,840
Oh, come on. Five minutes.

139
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,480
Take a tea break.

140
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,360
- Do you get a tea break?
- She can't, Dex. She's working.

141
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,960
Okay. Uh, in that case, we'll leave it.

142
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,200
Just the bill. Thanks.

143
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,440
Oh.

144
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,320
- I don't know how to work the...
- Yeah. It's fine. I'll get it.

145
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,000
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Yep.

146
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,280
Em.

147
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,240
Is there any way I could, you know...

148
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,160
What?

149
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,840
Give you the money for the drinks.

150
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,640
What?

151
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,880
I mean, is there any way
that I could tip you?

152
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,360
Tip me?

153
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,400
Yeah, why not? I really want to tip you.

00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,280
Oh. Uh, from university.

163
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,360
- Is that his girlfriend?
- Yeah, seems so.

164
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,280
But there's a quick turnover, so...

165
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,560
And I have... I have a question.

166
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,400
- Yep. Go on.
- What you doing tonight?

167
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,920
You don't hang about,
do you, Ian?

168
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,600
You've probably got a boyfriend anyway.

169
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,000
It's just, I'm doing a gig tonight
at Ha Bloody Ha.

170
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,120
At what?

171
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,760
Ha Bloody Ha. It's a comedy night
at the Frog and Parrot in Cockfosters.

172
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,400
Thought you might be interested
in my unique comedy stylings.

173
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,640
- Mm.
- The food's good too.

174
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,760
Just the usual mini burgers,

175
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,240
curly fries sort of thing, so...

176
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,640
Yeah, no. Uh, it sounds enchanting, Ian.

177
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,320
Curly fries and all, but, um...

178
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,600
No, I... I can't tonight. Sorry.

179
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,160
- Really?
- Really.

180
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,720
It's a nice offer,
but I'm meeting that mascara guy.

181
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,200
So I'll have to give it a miss,
I'm afraid.

182
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,400
Ah. Well, another time, then.
I've got upcoming gigs at The Bent Banana.

183
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
And The Cheshire Cat in Colliers Wood.

184
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,760
Maybe.

185
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,040
Hello, lovely.

186
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,520
- What the fuck?
- Don't ever, ever do that again.

187
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,680
Do what?

188
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,880
Come to where I work
like you're on safari.

189
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,680
Or bring your girlfriend for a tour.
"Look at the stupid menu

190
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,200
and the horrible toilets
and the ridiculous drinks."

191
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,880
You can have that back.

192
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,520
No, no, no. That's yours.

193
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,240
- Dex, listen to me. You don't tip friends.
- It's not a tip. It's a gift.

194
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,280
Oh, cash is not a gift.

195
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,520
Sorry.

196
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,240
Now, do your shirt up
and pass me the bottle.

197
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,280
So?

198
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,160
How are ya?

199
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,640
Oh, dreamy. Yeah, uh, let's see.

200
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,200
Um, I got salsa on my shoe today,
and it burned right through.

201
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,800
Why are you still there?

202
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,240
Well, Dex, I don't know
how to tell you this, but, um,

203
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,480
some people work in restaurants.

204
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,200
And some people work in shops.
Not everyone works in the media.

205
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,520
Sorry. That was really...

206
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,040
Yeah, well, it doesn't matter anyway.

207
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,520
I'm going home.

208
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,400
Back up north, Leeds, home.

209
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,600
To do what?

210
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,080
Honestly, I don't even know.

211
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,600
Okay.

212
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,000
Yeah. I mean, why not?

213
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,360
At least you can say that you tried.

214
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,520
You know, you really pulled out
all the stops

215
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,920
to make it in the big city.

216
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,800
You wrote one play, Em.

217
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,240
One.

218
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,600
And I know. I know people didn't come, but

219
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,080
so what?

220
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,320
Did you write something else?
Did you keep going?

221
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,920
No. You... you buried yourself
in quesadillas,

222
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,400
and now you're fucking off home.

223
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,000
You know, I used to think it was
a lack of confidence with you, Em, but

224
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,760
maybe it's not.

225
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,600
Maybe it's arrogance.

226
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,800
What?

227
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,920
"I wrote a play, and it didn't transfer
to the West End, so fuck this..."

228
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,120
Fuck off, Dex.

229
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,080
We don't all get
to meet someone on our gap year

230
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,520
who gives us a job in TV.

231
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,160
- It wasn't a job. It was work experience.
- Oh, work experience.

232
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,200
And that might be how I started,
but the rest has been on my own.

233
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,800
The point is,
you've got to stay on the ride.

234
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,160
Ride? The ride?
Dex, you don't have a clue.

235
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,760
Thank you, but I don't wanna work
in the media.

236
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,400
I mean, if people treated, I don't know,
nursing or social work or teaching

237
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,960
with the same reverence they do
people who work in bloody TV...

238
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,200
- So teach.
- Oh my God.

239
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,080
- Teach. You'd be a fantastic teacher.
- Stop.

240
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,120
- Dex, just stop!
- The best teacher.

241
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,400
I'm sorry.

242
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,080
No, I'm sorry.

243
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,280
What are you sorry for?

244
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,120
For ranting on.

245
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,320
For being so, so boring.

246
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,040
You're not boring.

247
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,080
No, I am.

248
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,680
I am. I bore myself.

249
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,720
Well, you don't bore me.

250
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,680
You could never bore me.

251
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,480
You're one in a million, Em.

252
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,920
- I'm not even one in three, so...
- Em.

253
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,920
Come lie down with me.

254
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,680
I'm sorry
I smell like Crisp and Dry.

255
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,520
You don't.

256
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,320
Much.

257
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,880
I feel ridiculous.

258
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,240
Why?

259
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,680
I don't know what I thought would happen
if I moved here.

260
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,800
You know what I can't understand?

261
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,920
You have all these people telling you
all the time how great you are.

262
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,440
You know, smart and funny
and talented and all that.

263
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,240
I mean, endlessly.

264
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,720
I've been telling you for years.

265
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,000
So why don't you believe it?

266
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,520
Why do you think people say that stuff?

267
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,560
Do you think it's all a conspiracy?

268
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,720
People secretly ganging up
to be nice about you?

269
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
No.

270
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,680
I better go.

271
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,040
No.

272
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,280
You're not going.

273
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,040
You're staying,
and we are getting another bottle.

Not great.

295
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,240
Another operation in September.

296
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,480
Aw, Dex. I'm sorry.

297
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,320
And Nomi?

298
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,560
What does she see in you, do you think?

299
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,520
Nomi.

300
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,440
She says I'm complicated.

301
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,080
Oh.

302
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,080
- She did not.
- She did.

303
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,200
No. Those words did not leave her mouth.

304
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,600
They did.

305
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,400
Complicated?

306
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,840
You're as complicated
as a two-piece jigsaw puzzle.

307
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,200
In thick ply.

308
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,200
Mm.

309
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,200
- Dex?
- Hmm?

310
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,520
Are people really having
that good a time?

311
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,840
Look at them,
throwing their little Frisbee.

312
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,000
What do you mean?

313
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,120
Just, all that frolicking.
It feels forced.

314
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,160
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to this evening's performance of youth.

315
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,360
Okay.

316
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,560
- Now I am actually gonna go.
- You could stay at mine if you wanted.

317
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,720
No.

318
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,640
Sleep on the couch. Borrow a toothbrush.

319
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,880
No. No, I... No, I should... I should go.

320
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,200
Okay.
