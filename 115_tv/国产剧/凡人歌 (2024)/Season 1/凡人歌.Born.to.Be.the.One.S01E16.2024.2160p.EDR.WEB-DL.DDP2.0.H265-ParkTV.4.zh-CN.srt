黑森林蛋糕  两个叉子

21
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,700
我不要甜点了
I don't want dessert.

22
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,210
那就一个叉子
One fork.

23
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,210
我要你别再抢着付帐
I want you to stop paying for everything.

24
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,210
-我不懂你的意思  　　　　　　　-你知道的
-I don't know what you mean.  -You know what I mean.

25
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,710
你总是在拿支票付钱
You're always picking up the cheque,

26
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:43,220
还有买电影票和日常杂货
And buying the movie tickets and getting the groceries.

-所以呢    -所以我是有工作的

不用你来养我
You don't have to support me.

29
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,320
我有能力付  你没有
I can afford it. you can't.

30
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,220
这有什麽大不了的
What's the big deal?

31
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,720
这对我来说很重要
It's a big deal to me.

32
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,230
我喜欢带你去好的地方  迈克
I like to take you nice places, Michael.

33
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,730
我也喜欢去啊  但是
And I like to go to them but...

34
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,230
我不喜欢一直都是你付帐
I don't like you paying for me all the time.

35
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,730
我  我感觉  很奇怪
I... I feel... funny.

36
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,740
你能负担的时候就让你付帐  行吗
You pay when you can, don't you?

37
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,240
好的  既然说到这个
Yeah, and speaking of which...

38
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,240
这个月的家用开支

41
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,770
一个月300块
$300 a month.

42
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,250
你确定这是一半的开销吗
You're sure that's half of everything?

43
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,250
当然了
Sure.

44
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,760
包括请清洁工和水电费
The cleaning lady? the utilities?

45
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,260
黑森林蛋糕来了
Chocolate death.

46
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,270
你要来一口吗
You want a bite?

47
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,320
「拉拉之夜」很有趣吧
Isn't "dyke nite" fun?

48
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,320
好久没这麽好玩了
Can't remember when I had such a good time.

49
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,320
我讨厌拉拉之夜
I hate "dyke nite".

50
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,820
我也是  我感觉被侵犯了
Me too. I feel so violated.

51
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,830
她们在干吗
Euw. what're they doing?

52
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,340
「拉拉调情」  你知道的
The "muncher mash"? You know...

53
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,840
茉儿
So, Mel,

54
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,850
你上次来「拉拉之夜」是多久之前？
When was the last time you were at "dyke nite"?

55
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,850
在我遇见琳赛之前
Oh, before I met Lindsay.

56
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,850
记住  我们说好了不提她的
Remember, we weren't going to mention her.

57
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:02,850
她很可爱
She's cute.

58
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,860
她让我想起红发的琳赛
She reminds me of Lindsay with red hair.

59
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,360
那她呢
What about her?

60
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,370
她让我想起黑发的琳赛
She reminds me of lindsay with black hair.

61
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,870
别告诉我
Don't tell me.

62
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,880
他让你想起变装的琳赛
He reminds you of Lindsay in drag.

63
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,380
我忍不住  就是想她
I can't help it. I miss her.

64
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,880
我以为我们能永远在一起
I thought we'd be together forever,

65
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,340
她就是我下半辈子
That she'd be the one I kissed good night

66
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,390
每晚睡前亲吻的人
for the rest of my life.

67
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,890
现在我和我堂妹丽塔住一起
Now I live with my cousin Rita,

68
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,390
每晚亲吻她说晚安
And kiss her good night.

69
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,890
老天
Christ!

70
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:43,400
听着  茉儿
Look, Mel,

71
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,900
和你一起玩很好
It's been great hanging with you.

72
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,900
你已经是一个很棒的腐女了
You've been a great fag-hag.

73
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,900
只是
Only the thing is;

74
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,900
腐女应该很开心的
Fag-hags are supposed to be fun.

75
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,410
为什麽你不去找琳赛
So why don't you go see Lindsay,

76
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,410
告诉她你的感受
Tell her how you feel,

77
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,410
然後跟她和好  好吗
And make up with her, okay?

78
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,410
在我做了那事之後  我还有脸去吗？
How can I do that after what I did?

79
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,580
不管你做了什麽
Whatever you did,

80
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,420
你要知道  这是两个人的事
You know, it takes two.

81
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,920
你没有什麽可失去的了
You got nothing to lose,

82
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,920
除非你还想等着下一次
Unless you really want to wait around for the next...

83
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,420
「来拉拉之夜」
"dyke nite". brrrr.

84
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,960
你喝了太多咖啡了
You drink too much coffee.

85
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,460
这不是咖啡  是拿铁
This isn't coffee. it's latte.

86
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,460
那就是5美元的咖啡
It's just coffee that costs five bucks.

87
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,960
还是会引起高血压
And it still causes high blood pressure,

88
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,970
心脏病发作  性功能下降
Heart attack, poor sexual performance.

89
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:55,970
没人抱怨过我的床上功夫
I haven't had any complaints.

90
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,970
更不用说失眠了
Not to mention insomnia.

91
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,470
反正通常我在床上也没睡觉
Well, usually when I'm in my bed, I'm not asleep anyway,

92
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,970
所以没关系
So it really doesn't matter.

93
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,980
知道吗  幸好我还很年轻
See, fortunately I have youth on my side.

94
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,980
我可以干上一整晚
I can stay up all night fucking

95
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,480
然後SAT考试照样拿1500分
And still score 1,500 on my S.A.T.S.

96
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,980
1500分
1,500?

97
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,990
-是的  -哇
-Yep.  -wow!

98
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,490
有那样的成绩
You could get into any school you wanted

99
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,990
你想进什麽学校都可以
With a score like that.

100
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,490
我申请了达特茅斯学院  布朗大学
I applied to Dartmouth, Brown...

101
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,990
你要到其他州去
You're going out of state?

102
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,500
怎麽了  你会在意吗？
Why? Do you give a shit?

103
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,500
只是我第一次听你说  仅此而已
It's just the first I've heard of it, that's all.

104
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,500
你在意！
You do!

105
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,510
你果然很在意！
You give a shit!

106
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,510
你真的很在意！
You give a shit!

107
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,800
你在乎我 在乎得要死
You so care about me.

108
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,010
你爱我这麽多
You love me so much.

109
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,020
下车吧你
Get out!

110
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,020
布莱恩·肯尼很在乎我
Brian Kinney gives a shit.

111
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,520
-去你的    -哈哈
-Fuck you. -Ha-ha.

112
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,530
你看起来很爽嘛
Mmm! Well you look self-satisfied.

113
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,030
我都想用「目中无人」这句话了
I'd even go as far as to say supercilious.

114
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:06,540
我们都知道你词汇考了700分
We all know you got 700 verbal.

115
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,540
别卖弄了
Stop showing off.

116
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,540
所以 他刚对你说什麽了
So, what did he say to you?

117
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,050
是那些他没说出口的话
Hmm, it's what he didn't say.

118
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:21,050
让一下  死娘炮
Excuse me, faggot.

119
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,050
我不是娘炮
I'm not a faggot.

120
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,050
对我来说  你就是
You look like one to me.

121
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,560
你想吸我的老二吗
You wanna suck my cock?

122
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,560
天啊  他就不能想点新花样吗
Aw, christ! can't they think of anything more original to say?

123
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,060
别欺负他  赫伯
Leave him alone, Hobbs.

124
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,070
今天一定是同志大会
Oh, must be a faggot convention.

125
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,070
-不要发泄在他身上           -发泄什麽
-Don't take it out on him.  -Take what out?

126
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,070
你的老二
Your dick.

127
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,070
娘炮
Faggot.

128

你们两个　住手
Okay, you two, break it up.

129
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,580
马上
Now!

130
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,300
泰勒  你再惹麻烦的话
Taylor, next time you cause trouble,

131
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,080
就直接找校长报到吧
You can talk to the principal.

132
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,580
什麽
What?

133
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,580
老师  贾斯汀什麽都没做  是克里斯的错
Sir, Justin didn't do anything. it was Chris.

134
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,590
他叫他死娘炮
He called him a faggot.

135
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,090
坐好  你们两个都坐好

00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,100
李普曼  你迟到了

-罗伊斯  -有

144
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:15,610
-泰勒  　　-娘娘到
-Taylor.   -Queer.

145
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,610
同学们  安静  汤玛斯
Okay, class, quiet down. Thomas.

146
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,610
不好意思  迪克生先生
Excuse me, Mr. Dixon?

147
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,120
什麽事  泰勒
What is it, Taylor?

148
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,620
克里斯刚刚骂我
Chris just called me queer.

149
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,120
我什麽都没听到
I didn't hear anything.

150
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,120
你怎麽可能没听到  大家都听到了
How could you not hear it? Everybody heard that.

151
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,130
坐下  泰勒
Sit down, Taylor.

152
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,630
我要他道歉
I want him to apologize.

153
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,630
我说了  坐下
I said sit down.

154
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,130
你打算什麽都不做吗
Aren't you going to do anything?

155
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,630
就这麽假装什麽都没发生
Are you just going to pretend that nothing happened?

156
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,140
你再说一句就把你送到校长办公室去
One more word from you and I'm sending you to the principal's office.

157
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,140
不麻烦你了
Huh! Don't bother.

158
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,640
娘娘起驾了  娘娘要出门了
The queer's going. the queer is out the door.

159
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,640
娘娘要离开了
The queer is gone.

160
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,140
够了
That's enough of that.

161
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,150
你知道什麽
Oh! What do you know?

162
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,650
他刚说了  你就什麽都没听到
He says it,you don't hear a thing.

163
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,150
但我说了
But when I say it...

164
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:04,160
既然你听力恢复了  就给我听好
Well, listen up, now that your hearing has returned.

165
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,160
这个娘娘说「干你娘的！」
This queer says, "fuck you!"

166
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,160
好的  够了  泰勒  你给我出去
Okay, that's it, Taylor. you are out of here.

167
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,680
下一位
Next customer, please.

168
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,180
你好  我是保罗
Hi, I'm Paul. uh...

169
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,680
如果你今天在我们这儿开一个理财帐户
If you open up a money market account with us today,

170
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,680
你就会得到一张50美元的
You'll get a $50 gift certificate

171
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,680
雷射除毛礼券
For laser hair removal.

172
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,180
谢了  我用蜜蜡除毛
Thanks. I wax.

173
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,690
我刚刚看了一下我的户头
Um, I was just looking at my statement,

174
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:38,190
除非是我不知道自己加薪了
And unless I got a raise that nobody told me about,

175
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,970
我的帐户多了很多
Um, there's a lot more money in my chequing account

176
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:40,690
不属於我的钱
than there should be.

177
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,700
刷一下你的卡然後输入密码
Oh. uh, just swipe your card and enter your pin number.

178
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,200
等你忙完我朋友的帐
When you're finished helping my friend,

179
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,700
可以帮我检查一下户头吗
Could you check the balance in my account?

180
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,700
当然可以
Sure.

181
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,700
麻烦写一下你的帐号
Do you want to put down the number?

182
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,710
这是你的电话
This is your phone number.

183
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,430
你可以先让他帮我
Would you please let him help me

184
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,720
处理完我的户头
with my financial problem

185
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,720
然後再处理你的龟头  好吗
Before you hit on him?

186
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,220
-你多了多少钱  　　　　　　　　　 -将近一千块
-So how much extra do you have?   -Almost 1,000.

187
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,230
哇~ 你最好常出现这种财务问题
Well, you should always have such financial problems.

188
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,230
看来你签出的一些支票没有被兑现
It appears some of your cheques haven't cleared.

189
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:20,730
哪些
Which ones?

190
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,740
566号和574号
Number 566, 574.

191
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,240
还有583号
583?

192
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,740
那个也是
That one too.

193
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,250
谢谢了
Well, thanks.

194
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,250
至少我知道问题出在哪儿了
Well, at least I know what the discrepancy is.

195
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,250
大卫根本没有兑现我的支票
David isn't cashing my cheques.

196
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,750
也许他忘了
Well, maybe he forgot.

197
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,750
他那种年纪很健忘的
You know how people are when they get to be his age.

198
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,760
走吧
Come on, let's go.

199
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,260
-我会给你打电话的　　　　　　-太好了
-I'll check this out, sir.  - Excellent.

200
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:54,270
还是有些服务  ATM是提供不了的
There are still certain services you can't get at an ATM.

201
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,790
琳
Linz...

202
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,300
茉儿
Mel...

203
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,800
我来看看盖斯  还有
I, um, came by to see Gus and...

204
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,300
琳  我想死你了
Oh, Linz, I miss you so much.

205
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,810
我一直在等你说这句话
I've waited so long to hear you say that.

206
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,810
真抱歉  亲爱的
I'm sorry, baby.

207
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,310
这一切我都很抱歉
I'm so sorry for everything.

208
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,820
我也是  谁的错都无所谓了
Me too. And it doesn't matter whose fault it was.

209
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,820
唯一重要的是  我们
Now all that matters... is this.

210
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:57,830
嗯（发音同"we"）
Oui?

211
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,330
「我们」
"we"?

212
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,830
「嗯」
"Oui".

213
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,840
意思是「有什麽事吗」
As in, "is there something you would like?"

214
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,840
实际上
Uh, actually...

215
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,340
对  我找琳赛
Yes. I'd like to see Lindsay.

216
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,840
琳赛现在不在
Ah, Lindsay is not here right now.

217
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,840
她在给别人上课
She's teaching class.

218
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,340
你是谁
And who are you?

219
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,850
我是吉拉姆  你是谁
I am Guillaume. And you are...?

220
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,850
茉蕾妮
Melanie.

221
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,850
啊  茉蕾妮  她的前女友
Ah, Melanie, the ex-girlfriend.

222
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,850
你知道我是谁
You know who I am?

223
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,850
你是那个出轨的人
You're the one who had the affair.

224
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,860
在法国的话  这当然不算什麽
Of courseen France, this would be meaningless.

225
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,360
我不相信她都告诉你了
I-I can't believe she told you that.

226
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,860
琳赛和我很亲密
Lindsay and I are very, uh, intime.

227
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,870
-亲密  　　　-我明白了
-Intimate.   -I got it.

228
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,870
我来看我儿子
Look, I stopped by to see my son.

229
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:38,370
我觉得不太方便  现在是他的用餐时间
Mmm. I-I'm afraid it's not possible. It's his feeding time.

230
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,370
-我可以  　　　　　　　-不不不
-Well, I could do...   -No, no, no. no.

231
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,870
我来就可以了  他很  呃
I will do it. He gets very, um...

232
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,380
怎麽说呢  他很挑剔
What you call it? uh, Finicky.

233
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,880
好吧  你他妈到底是谁
Okay. Who the fuck are you anyway,

234
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,380
为什麽琳赛从来没跟我说过你
and why hasn't Lindsay ever told me about you?

235
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,510
也许她不想告诉你
Perhaps it's her decision,

236
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,880
既然你们没住一起了
now that you're no longer living together,

237
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,890
就没必要和你分享她的生活细节
Not to share with you all the details of her life.

238
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:55,890
这很正常
This is normal.

239
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,890
我来了  我的小亲亲
I'm on my way, mon petit chou.

240
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,890
我会告诉她你来过了
So, I tell her you stop by.

241
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,910
既然大卫不去兑现我的支票
Why would David keep taking my cheques

242
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,910
为什麽他要收下呢
If he has no intention of cashing them?

243
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,910
也许他在等下一季
Well, maybe he's waiting until next quarter

244
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,410
等他不够钱交税的时候再说
When he has less tax liability.

245
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,920
真像会计师该说的话
Spoken like a true accountant.

246
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,920
也许他只是为了让你开心
Or maybe he's just taking them to humour you.

247
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,810
我可一点都开心不起来
Well, I'm not amused.

248
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:29,920
我有能力付钱
I can pay my own way.

249
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,420
-很高尚  　　　-还很蠢
-Very noble.   -Yeah, and stupid!

250
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,930
迈克  亲爱的
Michael, sweetie,

251
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,430
所有同志的梦想就是被人包养
It's every gay boy's dream to be a kept woman.

252
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,930
她在这儿干什麽
What's she doing in here?

253
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,930
-天啊  　　　　-你觉得我以前没看过老二吗
-Oh, christ!   -Do you think I've never seen a dick before?

254
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:43,940
没看过我的
Not mine!

255
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,440
没事的  没事的大家
It's okay. It's okay, everyone.

256
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,440
她是个拉子
She's a lesbian.

257
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,440
哦  她是个女同
Oh, she's a dyke.

258
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,440
茉蕾妮  你来这儿干什麽
Melanie, what are you doing here?

259
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,940
我听了你的建议  跑去找琳赛
I took your advice and I went to go see Lindsay.

260
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,950
你最後一次和她说话是什麽时候
Uh, when was the last time you talked to her?

261
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,450
几周之前
A couple of weeks.

262
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,950
她跟你提过一个法国佬吗
Did she mention anything about a French guy?

263
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:58,950
没有
No.

264
00:14:58,950 --> 00:14:59,950
法国佬？
A french guy?

265
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,950
我过去找她
I went over to see her,

266
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,960
这个混蛋法国猪来开门
And this fucking frog answered the door.

267
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,960
-所以呢  -所以当我想看看盖斯时
-So?     -So when I tried to see gus,

268
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,960
他妈的把门甩在我脸上
He slammed the god- damn door in my face.

269
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,460
所有人都知道
Well, every- body knows

270
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,960
法国人以闪电泡芙
The French are famous for eclairs,

271
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,460
口交和粗鲁闻名
Oral sex and rudeness.

272
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,470
我之前约过一个男的 三样齐全
I once had a date that involved all three.

273
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,970
也许她只是找了个保姆
Maybe she just got herself a babysitter.

274
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,470
从法国吗
From France?

275
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,970
她上课的薪水可付不起
A little pricey on her teacher's salary.

276
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,470
而且她怎麽都没跟我们提过
And how come she didn't tell us about it?

277
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,970
你好（法语）
Bonjour.

278
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:23,980
听听这个
H-hey, listen to this.

279
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,980
这是琳赛和吉拉姆家
You have reached Lindsay and Guillaume

280
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,480
还有可爱宝宝盖斯
And beautiful baby Gus.

281
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,480
如果你有事找我们
If you have a message for us,

282
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,480
请在哔声後留言
Kindly leave it after the beep.

283
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,980
「我们」
"Us."

284
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,990
对保姆来说真是过头了
It's pretty pushy for the help.

285
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,990
听起来他们像对夫妻
It makes it sound like they're a couple.

286
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,490
这样可是违背了犹太律法
Quelque chose isn't kosher.

287
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,950
你知道我上次拿
You know the last time I brought

288
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,010
热巧克力和饼乾上来是什麽时候吗
hot chocolate and fig newtons up here?

289
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:57,010
当迈克还住在这的时候
When Michael lived here?

290
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,010
真聪明
Smart kid. Hmmm.

291
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:03,010
他锁上房门待了好久
He'd lock himself in here for hours and hours.

292
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:05,520
告诉我他在玩模型飞机
Told me he was playing with his model airplanes.

293
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,520
我当然知道他在玩什麽
Ha! I know what he was playing with.

294
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,020
喏
Here.

295
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,530
想吃吗
You want one?

296
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,530
不了  谢谢
No thanks.

297
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,530
老师这样做真糟糕
It's a lousy thing that teacher did,

298
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,530
害你被停学
Having you suspended.

299
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:25,040
我应该一拳打在那个迪克生的鸡巴脸上
Yeah, I could punch dickhead Dixon's face in.

300
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,540
还有克里斯·赫伯
Chris Hobbs' too.

301
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,040
如果你做了  你就和他们一样了
Only then, you'd be just like them.

302
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,050
那又怎麽样
So what?

303
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,050
-他们活该被打  　　-他们的确是
-They deserve it.  -Sure they do.

304
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,050
但是有更好的方法来解决
But there are better ways of handling it.

305
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,550
退学吗
Huh, quit school?

306
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,560
让他们高兴吗
And give them the pleasure?

307
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,570
那些人
There were people...

308
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,570
当他们知道迈克是同志後
When they found out that Michael was gay...

309
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:06,080
说了和做了最残忍的事情
Who said, and did, the cruelest things.

310
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,080
朋友
Friends...

311
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,080
邻居
Neighbours...

312
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,080
家人
Family.

313
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,090
我姐姐甚至不让她的孩子过来玩
My own goddamn sister wouldn't even let her kids come over here.

314
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:20,590
她怕迈克会骚扰她的孩子
She was afraid Michael was going to molest them or something.

315
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:23,590
因为人们就是会这样
Because that's the way people are.

316
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:26,100
他们很无知  很害怕
They're ignorant and they're scared.

317
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,600
而你完全无能为力
And there's nothing you can do...

318
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,110
只能教育他们或者打死他们
Except educate 'em or shoot 'em.

319
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,110
我加入了同志老妈联盟  因为我觉得
Me, I joined P-FLAG, 'cause I figured

320
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,610
这比打死他们更实际
It was more practical than shooting 'em.

321
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,120
你学校有同志社团吗
Do you have a gay club at your school?

322
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,120
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

323
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,620
常有人这麽说我
I've been accused of it.

324
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,630
不  我应该是学校唯一的同志学生
No. I'm, like, the only gay student there.

325
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,130
我可不信  阳光小子
I doubt that, sunshine.

326
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,140
同志小孩到处都有
Gay kids are everywhere.

327
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,640
只是他们和你不一样
Only they're not all like you...

328
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,640
因为他们害怕被人发现道
'cause they're afraid to show their faces.

329
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,150
这就是为什麽
That's why maybe...

330
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,650
你应该做点什麽去帮助他们　让他们了解
You've got to do something to help them know that...

331
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,150
他们并不孤单
They're not the only ones.

332
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,160
我没有兑现支票是因为我用不到你的钱
I didn't cash your cheques because I don't need your money.

333
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,660
但是我得付给你
But I need to give it to you.

334
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,170
迈克  你知道
Michael, you know, of course,

335
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,670
每个月的一半开销不只是三百块
That half the monthly expenses aren't really $300.

336
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,670
我当然知道  我还知道不管是多少
Of course I know, and I'm sure whatever it is,

337
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,670
我都付不起  但是这不是重点
I couldn't afford it, but that's not the point.

338
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:47,680
-我想尽量帮点忙　  　　　　　　　　　　　　　-你帮了
-Uh, I want to contribute as much as I can. - And you do.

339
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,680
你帮了  你给了我比金钱更贵重的东西
You do. You give me something much more valuable than money.

340
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,180
你给了我你的可爱
You give me your sweetness,

341
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,190
你的迷人  你的幽默和你性感的小屁股
Your charm, your humour, your hot little butt.

342
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:57,190
我是说  付一半的水电瓦斯费
I mean, what's paying half the gas and electric

343
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,690
怎麽能和这个比  迈克
Compared to that, Michael?

344
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,690
我可不是你的金屋藏娇
I'm not some boytoy you're keeping.

345
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,700
我从来没这麽想过  别这样羞辱我
I've never thought of you as my boytoy. Don't insult me.

346
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,700
给我吧
I'll take that.

347
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,200
好的
Okay.

348
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,210
只要你高兴随你怎麽做  随你要什麽
Okay, whatever will make you happy. Whatever you want.

349
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,210
我只要你收下我的钱
What will make me happy is if you...

350
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,210
然後别老抢着付帐
Take my money and you stop paying for everything.

351
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,710
好吧  从此以後我们只做
Fine. From now on, we'll only do things

352
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,720
我们都可以负担得起的事
That we can both afford to do, together.

353
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,720
还有一件事
There's only one thing.

354
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:34,730
什麽
What's that?

355
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,730
别生气  本来应该是个惊喜的
Don't get mad. It was supposed to be a surprise.

356
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,230
但是
But you know that...

357
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:43,230
你放假的那周
The week that you have off from work?

358
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,740
我自己也安排了休假  我订了
I cleared it for me too, and I popped for...

359
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,740
去巴黎的行程
A trip to Paris.

360
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:52,740
头等舱  乔治五世酒店套房
First-class, suite at the hotel "Georges V".

361
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,750
还预订了最好的餐馆
Reservations at all the finest restaurants.

362
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,250
哇塞
Wow. That...

363
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,250
听起来太棒了
That sounds fantastic.

364
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,250
-我知道  　-但是
-I know.   -But...

365
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,760
不  我知道  我知道
No, I know. I know.

366
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,760
我又做错事了
It was the wrong thing to do. I'll, uh...

367
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,760
明天我会取消它
Cancel it tomorrow.

368
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,260
我们就待在家里  看部电影
And we'll just stay home, watch a movie...

369
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,260
或者两部也行  在家自己做饭吃
Or two, eat in.

370
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,770
这样也不错
And that can still be fun.

371
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,780
嗨  琳赛
Hi, Lindsay.

372
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,780
希望你不介意我们就这样找上门
Hope you don't mind us all dropping by like this.

373
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,790
其实你们可以先打个电话
Actually, you could have called.

374
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,790
打了  但是转到了语音信箱
We did, and got your message.

375
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,800
看看谁来了
Look who's here.

376

385
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,320

There's no need to worry about Gus now that I'm here.

386
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,830
你在这我才更担心  我的朋友（法语）
Mm-hm. I wasn't worried when you weren't... Mon ami.

387

00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,330
很高兴认识你（法语）
Enchante.

391
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:24,340
我们正在吃晚饭
We were just in the middle of dinner,

392
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,340
所以如果你们不介意的话
So if you don't mind...

如果你想的话  你朋友们可以跟我们一起吃
Uh, i-if you would like, your friends may join us.

394
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,340
应该有足够的兔肉
There's enough... rabbit for everyone.

395
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,350
兔肉吗
R-rabbit?

396
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,850
是的  我炖了一锅
Yes, I made a, uh, stew.

397
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:40,850
炖的兔肉吗
With... with rabbit?

398
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:44,360
-兔子肉吗  　　　-据说味道像鸡肉
-Bunny rabbit?   -They say it tastes just like chicken.

399
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,860
请过来  尝一些吧
Please, uh, come, try some.

400
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,860
就尝一点吧
Well, maybe just a... little taste.

401
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,370
我有一点饿  所以
I'm... I'm a little hungry, so, uh...

402
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:01,370
发生什麽事了
What's going on?

403
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,870
对啊  这个男的是谁
Yeah. Who's this guy?

404
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,380
还有他在我们家干什麽
And what's he doing in our house?

405
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,380
不好意思  我不喜欢你们直接闯进来
Excuse me, I don't appreciate your barging in here

406
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,880
质问我
And interrogating me.

407
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,380
谁在质问你啊
Oh-ho, whoa. Who's interrogating you?

408
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,880
我们只是问问
We're just asking you.

409
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,880
吉拉姆在大学教法语
Guillaume teaches french at the university.

410
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:15,890
我们认识几年了
We've been friends for a couple of years.

411
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,390
那你怎麽从来都没提起过他
Yeah well, how come you never mentioned him?

412
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,890
我提过的
I did.

413
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,390
只是你从来都没听进去
You just never listened.

414
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:22,890
不管怎麽样
Huh. Anyway,

415
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:25,900
我们可以各取所需
He needed some help, and so did I.

416
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,400
所以我就让他搬进来了
So I said he could move in.

417
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,900
那你怎麽不告诉我们呢
So why didn't you tell us?

418
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,900
我们最近不是都没联络了吗
We haven't exactly been communicating lately.

419
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,410
我的天哪
Oh, my god!

420
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,410
这真是太好吃了
This is fabulous! Magnifique!

421
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:38,910
这是我有生以来吃过最棒的兔肉
It's the best rabbit I've ever had.

422
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,410
也是头一次吃
The only rabbit I've ever had.

423
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,420
对  他是个很棒的厨师
Yeah, he's a... fantastic cook,

424
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,920
他照顾小孩也很厉害
And he's wonderful with the baby.

425
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,420
盖斯马上就喜欢他了
And Gus took to him immediately.

426
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,920
而且有他帮忙还房贷
And I can't tell you what a relief it is

427
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,430
让我轻松了不少
Having him help with the mortgage.

428
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,430
听起来真是完美的安排啊
Sounds like the perfect arrangement.

429
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,430
那他还要住多久
So how long is he staying?

430
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,930
那要看情况
That all depends.

431
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,940
直到他找到自己的栖身之所吗
Until he finds a place of his own?

432
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,440
直到....  我们结婚
Until... We get married.

433
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,450
什麽
What?

434
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:18,950
你疯了吗
Are you fucking nuts?

435
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,950
不要太激动了  只是权宜之计
Don't get so excited. It's just an arrangement.

436
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:22,450
我能多个帮手
I can get some help,

437
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,960
他可以留在美国  领到绿卡
And he can stay in the country and get his green card.

438
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,460
我认为你们应该快点来吃（法语）
Alors, I must insist that you come eat tout de suite,

439
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,960
不然都凉了
Or else it gets cold.

440
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,970
他说那些话  感觉像在暗示
The way he insinuated himself...

441
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:46,980
对  就像...那是他的房子  他住那里
Right. Like... like... it was his house...That he belongs there...

442
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,480
而你和我  反而像陌生人
And you and I were like a couple of strangers.

443
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,980
我很想哈一支烟
I need a cigarette, bad.

444
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,980
这全都是我的错
This is all my fault.

445
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,980
如果不是我  这一切就不会发生了
If it weren't for me, none of this would be happening.

446
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,490
受折磨的茉蕾妮
Oh, Melanie the martyr.

447
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:56,490
要我帮你「点火」吗？
You want me to set you on fire?

448
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:57,990
混蛋  借我个火
Asshole, just gimme a light.

449
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,490
如果她真要这麽做
And if she goes through this,

450
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:04,500
他会在那住个几年
He's going to have to live there for at least a couple of years.

451
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
到那时盖斯就会吸高卢烟(法国香烟)
And by then Gus'll be smoking Gauloises and...

452
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,000
还不抹体香剂
Not wearing deodorant.

453
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,500
然後她会继续她的新生活
And she'll have moved on with her life.

454
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,000
那我们就不可能再在一起了
There's no way we'll ever get back together.

455
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
除非让她知道
If only she knew

456
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,010
她会因此惹上多少麻烦
How much trouble she could get into;

457
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:18,510
我知道琳赛自己可能不太在意
Well, knowing Lindsay... probably wouldn't care.

458
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:21,010
她总是很照顾其他人
She's always looking out for the welfare of others.

459
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,510
她是很大方的人
The generous one.

460
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:25,020
而我总是自私的
Then there's me, the selfish one.

461
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,520
我只是想上床  然後就只是打炮
I wanted a fuck, and boy, did I get fucked.

462
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,020
满足自己的需求不算有错啊
There's nothing wrong with getting your needs met.

463
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,020
从你口中说出来可不新鲜啊
That's no surprise coming from you.

464
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,030
几乎是你的座右铭
It's your manifesto.

465
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:39,030
这不是我专属的  如果每个人都勇於承认
Well, it would be everyone's if they were honest enough to admit it.

466
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,530
别再自责啦  很烦啊
So stop blaming yourself. It's boring.

467
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,030
关键不是你的错
And you don't deserve it.

468
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,040
-嗨    -嗨
-Hey!  -Hey.

469
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,040
明天不是有课吗?  你应该在黛比家念书吧?
Isn't it a school night? Shouldn't you be at Deb's studying?

470
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,040
-我被勒令停学了    -你?
-I got suspended.  - You?

471
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,550
停两天
For two days.

472
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,050
我看到一个学生被侮辱
I saw this student getting bashed,

473
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,050
我那恐同的老师只是在一旁看着...
And my homophobic teacher wouldn't do anything about it...

474
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,050
所以我叫他他妈的滚远一点
So I told him to fuck off.

475
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,560
全班榜样啊
Go to the head of the class.

476
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,560
这可勾起不少回忆
That brings back memories,

477
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,560
在操场上被打的半死不活
Getting the shit kicked out of you on the playground.

478
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:17,070
在更衣室里被燃着的火柴砸过来
Mmm. Having... lit matches thrown at you in the locker room.

479
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:19,070
美好的时光
Good times. Yeah.

480
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:23,070
我可没想过你也遇过
I don't suppose anything like that ever happened to you.

481
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,080
有一次一个橄榄球员抓住我
Well, once this straight football jock picked me up,

482
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,580
按住我的头往马桶里浸
And dunked my head in the toilet.

483
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,580
那你怎麽办?
What did you do?

484
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,580
我跟踪他到衣柜
I followed him to his locker.

485
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,960
衣柜门打开的  他的手像这样伸开
It was open, his hand was up kind of like this;

486
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,930
他正在大笑
He was laughing;

487
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,650
我猛地把门甩上  他就断了三根手指
So I slammed the door so hard it broke three of his fingers.

488
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,100
他那一季都不能出赛了
And that was the end of the season for him.

489
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,100
一个「同男-直男」什麽?
A gay-straight what?

490
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,110
「异同学生联盟」
Student alliance.

491
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:57,110
这是什麽鬼东西?
What the fuck is that?

492
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,610
一个社团
It's a club,

493
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:03,110
一个讨论问题然後举办活动的社团
A forum where students discuss issues, plan events.

494
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,620
你知道   促进互相了解
You know, to promote understanding.

495
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,620
我快睡着了
I'm asleep already.

496
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:11,120
我需要你的专家见解
I need your expertise.

497
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,620
我已经教你很多了
I think I've given you plenty.

498
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:18,630
你的工作专才
Your business expertise.

499
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:21,130
这可没什麽市场  尤其在圣詹姆士中学
It's a tough sell, especially at St. James.

500
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:24,640
如果我去你办公室  跟你提出这个概念
So, say I brought this concept to you at your office.

501
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,140
你会怎麽行销它?
How would you market it?

502
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,640
现在是凌晨1点30分
It's 1:30 in the morning,

503
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,140
而且我慾火焚身
And I'm horny as hell.

504
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,640
拜托
Please?

505
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:40,330
好
Okay.

506
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,150
你当顾客
You're the client.

507
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,160
泰勒先生  请坐
Have a seat, Mr. Taylor.

508
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,660
有什麽好笑?
Well, what's so funny?

509
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:55,170
我都是这样幻想我的顾客
You know, that's just how I imagine all my clients.

510
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,670
幻想他们一丝不挂
I picture them naked.

511
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,170
我真不敢相信我在做这件事
I can't believe I'm doing this.

512
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:01,170
好吧
Okay.

513
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:05,680
你有这个"异同学生联盟"的想法
So you have this concept, the gay-straight student alliance.

514
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,180
让我们活在当下
Let's all live together.

515
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:10,180
赋予人们权利  和平  有够无聊的
Power to the people. Peace. That's boring as shit.

516
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,680
我可以拿把乌兹冲锋枪扫射人群
I could take out an UZI and shoot everyone.

517
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,680
那还让人兴奋一点
That would be exciting.

518
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,690
起码你引起人家注意了
Well, at least you'd get their attention.

519
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:18,690
我们要想个推销它的好点子
Now we have to figure out a way to sell it.

520
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:21,190
对啊  要怎麽做呢?
Right. How?

521
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:29,700
-跟推销其他东西的办法一样：「性」              -性?
- The same way you sell everything else. Sex.  -Sex?

522
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,200
想让他们参与  就发给他们这个
You want to get 'em in the tent. Hand out these.

523
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,200
保险套?
Condoms?

524
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,710
你说是个联盟
You said it was an alliance.

525
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:39,710
除了这个还有什麽更能吸引他们的?
What better way for everyone to come together?

526
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:49,220
他想带你去巴黎?
He wants to take you to Paris?

527
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,720
亲爱的  你真是全世界最幸运的人啊
Honey, you're the luckiest boy in the world.

528
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,720
把糖浆递给我
Pass me the syrup.

529
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,220
我超爱巴黎的
I love Paris.

530
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,730
你又没去过巴黎
You've never been to Paris.

531
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:57,730
我知道我到了那  绝对会爱上那里
Well, I know I'll love it when I get there.

532
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,730
那你们什麽时候动身?
So when are you leaving?

533
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:01,730
不去了
We're not.

534
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,230
你说什麽(法语)
Excusez-moi?

535
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:06,240
我又没那麽多钱  享受那种旅行
I don't have the money for that kind of a trip.

536
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,240
你是付不起  可大卫付得起啊
Of course you don't. But David does.

537
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,240
我告诉他  我不能让他替我付钱
I told him I couldn't let him pay for me.

538
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,740
你是不是脑子烧坏了?
Are you completely mad?

539
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,240
你当然可以让他请客
Of course you can.

540
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,250
大卫和我达成了一项协议
David and I have an arrangement.

541
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,750
我们只进行一些双方都能担负得起的活动
We only do things that we can both afford.

542
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:21,250
巴黎,别了！  匹兹堡,您好！
Au revoir, Paris. Bonjour, pittsburgh.

543
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:24,250
我虽然没机会看见塞纳河的日落
All right, so I won't get to see the Seine at sunset,

544
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,760
也不能在卢森堡的公园散步
Or... or stroll through the Luxembourg gardens,

545
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,260
他计划好的其他超棒的事也泡汤了  但至少...
Or any of the other wonderful stuff he had planned, but at least...

546
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,260
你维护了你的「尊严」 (衣服品牌)
You'll have your pride?

547
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,260
我听说
Ah. I hear it's what

548
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,760
巴黎今年很流行这牌子
Everyone is wearing in Paris this year.

549
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,270
大卫带我去吃晚餐
David already takes me to dinner,

550
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,770
买日常用品
He buys the groceries.

551
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:38,270
付担所有家计
He pays all the house expenses.

552
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:40,270
这种好事到哪找?
Where do I sign up?

553
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,770
这是不对的
It's not right.

554
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:42,770
可如果那是他心甘情愿的呢?
But if he wants to do it?

555
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,280
他也是这麽说的  他说这让他很开心
That's what he says. He says it makes him happy.

556
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,280
那你就别他妈的这麽自私了
Then stop being so goddamn selfish.

557
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,780
自私?
Selfish?

558
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,280
不满足他的需求就是自私
I think it's selfish to deny your lover pleasure.

559
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,290
听我说  迈克  钱的事我可是专家
Listen to me, Michael. Money is my business.

560
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:59,790
我见过很多为了钱分手的情侣
I've seen it destroy more relationships than sex.

561
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:02,290
现在  你觉得这种维护假尊严的行为
Okay? Now you think you're being fair to David

562
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:04,290
对大卫来说是一种公平
With this false pride thing of yours,

563
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:06,300
可这只会造成他怨怼和伤心
But it'll only cause resentment and frustration.

564
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,800
而且坦白地说  你也剥夺了自己
And frankly, you're denying yourself the opportunity

565
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,300
看看外面世界的机会
To go places that you could never go,

566
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,310
还有尝试其他新鲜事物的机会
And do things you could never do.

567
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,810
就像芭芭拉在「你好！多莉」里 (电影主题曲)
It's like what Barbra said so eloquently

568
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,810
尖锐地说着
In "hello, dolly!",

569
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:21,810
即使当时她还太年轻不适合演那角色
Even though she was years too young for the part.

570
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,320
「钱就像是肥料」
"Money is like manure.

571
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,820
「不把它洒遍各地  让它推动事物发展」
It isn't worth a thing unless you spread it around,

572
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,820
「它就什麽都不是」
encouraging things to grow.

573
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:29,820
「明白了吗?」
Ya know what I mean?"

574
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,830
亲一个  贺瑞斯
Kiss me, Horace.

575
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:43,330
放学之後有一个
There's a meeting after school

576
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:45,340
「异同学生联盟」的集会
of the gay-straight student alliance.

577
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,340
放学之後有一个集会
Uh... uh, after school there's a meeting...

578
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,840
「异同学生联盟」
The gay-straight student alliance.

579
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,840
-要不要一个免费保险套?        -好啊
-Hey, you want a free condom? -Oh, yeah.

580
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,340
来  从这里拿一个
Here, you gotta take one of these then.

581
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,850
-酷啊  谢了    -这给你
-Cool. Thanks. - Here.

582
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,350
不错   这给你
Sure. Here you go.

583
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:59,350
放学之後有一个集会
Um, there's a meeting after school,

584
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,350
请拿一个免费保险套  还有传单
Please take a free condom and a flyer.

585
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,850
布莱恩还真有一套
Brian knows what he's talking about.

586
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:05,360
-是啊  他很聪明          -而且火辣
- Yeah, he's brilliant.  -And hot!

587
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,860
可以给我一个保险套吗?
Can I have a condom?

588
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,860
当然可以
Sure. um...

589
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,360
你好  泰勒
Hey, Taylor,

590
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,860
你创办一个「塞康社」吗?
You starting a faggot club?

591
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,360
不论同志还是直男  都可以参加
It's for gay students and straight students.

592
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,370
为了让两个群体互相尊重  互相理解
To promote tolerance and understanding.

593
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:20,370
这麽说插人屁眼是社团课程罗?
So now butt- fucking is an extracurricular activity?

594
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:21,870
不是  只是打手枪而已
No, just hand-jobs.

595
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,890
你最好永远别提起那件事  你这个吸屌男
You better never mention that again, you little cocksucker.

596
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,400
我承认这事有点疯狂
I admit it's a little crazy.

597
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,900
疯狂?  如果是钱的问题
Crazy? You know, if this is about money,

598
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,400
我告诉过你  我可以帮你
I told you I'd help you out.

599
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,400
你已经帮很多忙了
And you have.

600
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,410
我得学着自己处理
But I got to start taking care of myself.

601
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,410
我不能永远指望着你和茉蕾妮
I mean, I can't keep relying on you and Melanie.

602
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:59,910
好吧  但你非得和他结婚吗?
Okay, but do you have to fucking marry him?

603
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:02,910
就做做样子而已  只是个协议
But it's not a real marriage. It's just an arrangement.

604
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:04,410
那他最好想个别的协议
Well, he should arrange something else.

605
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,920
如果他是直人的话  他可以和某人邂逅
If he was straight, he could meet someone,

606
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,420
坠入爱河  然後结婚
Fall in love and get married.

607
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,920
但因为他是同志  现在无法达成
But because he's gay, there's no way.

608
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,920
而且这对双方都不公平
And that's not fair.

609
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,420
真是理直气壮  义愤填膺
Well, listen to the righteous indignation.

610
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,430
倒是挺像我之前认识的琳赛
Kinda sounds like the Lindsay I used to know.

611
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,930
是吗  过去的琳赛是什麽时候?
Oh, yeah, which Lindsay was that?

612
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:22,930
大四你变成  疯狂搞政治活动的拉拉
The last year of college when you turned into that scary political dyke.

613
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:25,440
她啊  那个写请愿书
Oh, her. The one who started the petition

614
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,440
建议对约会强暴犯  处以阉割处罚的琳赛
to make date-rape punishable by castration.

615
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,940
我还让你签名了
I even got you to sign.

616
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,440
是啊  你总是从事那些崇高的事
Yeah, well, you always were one for a worthy cause.

617
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,950
那个  小茉和我一直在考虑
Listen, Mel and I've been thinking...

618
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:37,950
等等
Wait a minute.

619
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,950
你刚是不是说了
Did I just hear you say...

620
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:42,950
「小茉和我?」
"Mel and I"?

621
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,460
你真这麽说吗?
Did you actually say that?

622
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,960
这些年来  我一直努力
Years I have struggled

623
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,960
让你和小茉和平共处
To get Mel and you to be civil to each other,

624
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,960
哪怕让你们能和平同处一室也行
even be in the same room together.

625
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,470
现在可好  小茉和你同一战线了?
Now all of a sudden, Mel and you are allies?

626
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:04,470
我可没时间管我那群自私
Well, I don't have time to worry about what my selfish,

627
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:06,480
自我中心  而且自恋的朋友们想什麽
Self-centred, narcissistic friends think.

628
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,980
我得全心放在我儿子身上
I have to think about my son,

629
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,480
想想我怎麽抚养他  支持他
And how I'm going to raise and support him.

630
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,480
我得想想什麽对他是最好的
I have to think about what's best for him.

631
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,980
所以我觉得  你最好还是他妈滚开！
So I think you should just fuck off.

632
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,990
我觉得你可以理解的
I'm sure that's a thought you can understand.

633
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:26,000
我还以为来的人会更多呢  你不觉得吗?
I thought a lot more people would come, didn't you?

634
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,500
那些保险套都被拿光了
I mean, considering all the condoms we handed out.

635
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,000
是啊  我猜他们迫不及待想戴上它
Yeah. I guess they couldn't wait to use them.

636
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,010
嘿
Hey!

637
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:37,510
来的人不少啊
Not a bad turnout, huh?

638
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:40,510
黛比  你来这儿干嘛啊
Deb, wh... what are you doing here?

639
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,510
我想你们需要些饼乾  并表达精神上的支持
Well, I thought you could use some cookies and moral support.

640
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:46,520
来点饼乾吧  孩子们
Here you go, kids. huh?

641
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,520
别客气
Enjoy yourselves.

642
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,020
手工烤的
Home-baked.

643
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,520
我的姑姑费怡曾在一个歌舞团表演过
My great-aunt Fay, who was in burlesque,

644
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,030
她说永远不要在一群饥肠辘辘的观众面前表演
said you should never go on in front of a hungry audience.

645
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:59,030
我们是不是得开始了
Well, I guess we should get started, huh?

646
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:01,030
好吧
Well...

647
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:03,030
祝你好运  小阳光
Good luck, sunshine. hmm?

648
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:06,040
你也是  达芙妮  征服他们吧
You too, Daphne. knock 'em dead.

649
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,540
请大家安静一下
Could we have your attention? Please?

650
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,550
谢谢
Thank you.

651
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:25,060
你们好  我是达芙妮
Hi. um, I'm Daphne.

652
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:28,060
欢迎来到圣詹姆斯学校 「异同学生联盟」的
Welcome to the first meeting of the St. James

653
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,060
第一次集会
Gay-straight student alliance.

654
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,560
接下来的几周里  我们会讨论一些
In the upcoming weeks, we will be discussing issues

655
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,070
圣詹姆斯学校里  与所有人有关的议题
that affect all of us here at st. James...

656
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:38,070
这社团不是谈性的吗?
Isn't this supposed to be about sex?

657
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,570
性只是一部份
Sex is part of it.

658
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,570
也有一些别的事情
But it's also about other things.

659
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:44,070
比如我们怎麽看待自己  怎麽看待他人
Like how we see ourselves and each other.

660
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:46,080
算了吧  我们走吧
Fuck this. let's go.

661
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,580
屁精
Faggot!

662
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,590
吸屌男!  同性恋!
Cocksucker! Homo!

663
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:59,090
甲甲! 统塞康!
Fudge-packer!

664
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:02,590
我之前曾被人这麽叫过
Those are a few of the names that I have been called

665
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,590
就因为我是同性恋
Because I'm gay.

666
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,600
也有人跟我说  我会下地狱
I've also been told that I'm going to hell,

667
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,100
还说我会染上爱滋而死
And that I should die of aids.

668
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,600
也许你们也遇到过类似的情况
Maybe the same thing has happened to you.

669
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,110
这就是我们聚在这里的原因
That is why we're here...

670
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:20,110
试着接受我们  彼此的不同
To see if we can learn to accept our differences

671
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,610
并了解我们相同之处
And recognize our similarities.

672
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:25,620
不管是同志还是异性恋  我们的初衷都是一样
Because gay or straight, we all want the same things.

673
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,120
好吧  泰勒  闹够了
All right, Taylor, that's enough.

674
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,120
我们只是开个会...
We're... we're just having a meeting.

675
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,120
你得到校长的允许了吗?
Did you get permission from the principal?

676
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,130
你有申请用这间教室吗?  你们有指导老师吗?
Did you ask to use this classroom? Do you have an advisor?

677
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,130
他有我
He's got me.

678
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,630
你是谁?
And who are you?

679
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,130
黛比·瓦特尼  你又是谁?
Debbie Novotny. Who are you?

680
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,630
我是学校的教职员
I'm a member of the faculty.

681
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,130
那你应该很高兴看到
Well then, you'll be happy to know

682
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:45,640
我们正在进行一堂很有教育意义的课程
that we're having a little educational program here.

683
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,640
你坐下来听听吧
So why don't you sit down?

684
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,640
也许会有所收获呢
You might learn something.

685
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,140
这也是你课程的一部份吗?
Is this part of your curriculum?

686
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,640
废什麽话  当然是
You bet your ass it is.

687
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:57,650
现在  所有人都离开这  会议结束了
Now, all of you, on your way. This meeting is over.

688
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:59,150

689
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,160

-See you, Justin.  -See you, Daphne.

691
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,160
别放弃  达芙妮
Try again, Daphne.

692
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,180
干

693
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,190
真是辛苦的一周

694
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:42,690
我真想抽时间放松一下
I am really looking forward to taking some time off.

695
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,700
明天早上七点半还有个病人
Got a patient at 7:30.

696
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,700
晚安
Good night.

697
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,710
-大卫    -怎麽了?
-David?  -Yes?

698
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,720
你觉得我自私吗?
Do you think I'm selfish?

699
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,720
你?
You?

700
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,220
这是哪门子问题?
What kind of a question is that?

701
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,230
我是说...
I mean, about...

702
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:18,730
不接受你慷慨的付出
n-not taking you up on your generosity, like...

703
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:20,230
像是这次旅行...
like going on this trip.

704
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,230
迈克
Michael...

705
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,740
我告诉过你
I already told you,

706
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:31,240
我所做的一切都是想让你快乐
all I want to do is make you happy.

707
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,240
没错  但是你呢?
Yeah, but what about you? What would...

708
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,250
怎样才能让你快乐?
would make you happy?

709
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:39,750
我要怎样才快乐?
What would make me happy?

710
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,760
看见你第一次感受巴黎
Seeing you see Paris for the first time,

711
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,760
沿着塞纳河游览
sailing down the... seine on abateau-mouche,

712
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,270
在伟富尔酒店
Having the best meal of our lives at...

713
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,770
或者阿伦·杜卡瑟酒店
"le grand vefour" or, uh...

714
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:01,770
享受最棒的美食
"Alain Ducasse".

715
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,280
看到你的眼睛因为在跳蚤市场
Seeing your eyes light up

716
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,280
发现小玩具而闪闪发光
when you find some neat little toy in a flea market;

717
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,780
那会使我快乐
That would make me happy.

718
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,280
会使我非常快乐
That would make me very happy.

719
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,790
我希望你快乐
I want you to be happy.

720
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:21,790
你是说你想去巴黎?
Are you saying you want to go?

721
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:25,300
既然你已经提前准备
Well, since you already went ahead

722
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,300
规划了一切...
and made the plans and everything...

723
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,300
别为了我委屈自己
Don't do me any favours.

724
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:37,310
我不会  答应我让我付出点什麽
No, just promise me you'll let me pay for something

725
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:38,810
偶尔就好
every once in a while.

726
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,810
让你付买面包的钱
I'll let you pay for the baguettes.

727
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,320
不如我们先练练法语吧?
What do you say we practice our French?

728
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:26,860
这主意不错
This is a good one.

729
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:29,860
我也喜欢
Oh, I like this one too.

730
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,860
我们家庭很美满
We do make a handsome family.

731
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,860
-对吗?  -没错
-Hein?  -Mmm-hmm.

732
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:38,370
我们应该把这个放在相框里
We should put this one in a frame...

733
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:41,370
代替这个
Instead of that one.

734
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:45,880
布莱恩  他很美
Brian. He's very beautiful.

735
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,380
很多人都这麽觉得
Lots of guys would agree with you.

736
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,880
特别是他的嘴唇
Especially his lips.

737
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,380
亲起来很爽  对吧?
They're quite kissable, yes?

738
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,390
-不!     -你不用担心
-No!     -oh! la la! you needn't worry.

739
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:57,890
我知道他不喜欢我
I can tell he doesn't like me.

740
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:00,390
茉蕾妮或者你其他朋友也不喜欢
And neither does Melanie or your other friends...

741
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:01,890
他们不是不喜欢你
It's not you they don't like.

742
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:03,890
而是不喜欢我们现在做的事
It's what we're doing.

743
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,900
但这不是他们的决定
But, it's not their decision.

744
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,900
你是个好人  琳赛
Well, you are a wonderful person, Lindsay.

745
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,900
不  这是真的
No, no, no, it's true.

746
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,050
如果不是你
If it weren't for you,

747
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:15,410
我就要离开美国了
I'd have to leave the states.

748
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:17,410
而现在我可以留下
Now I'll be able to stay.

749
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,920
亲爱的  是茉蕾妮
Cherie, c'est Melanie.

750
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:39,430
盖斯应该起来了
Gus should be up from his nap.

751
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,430
我去看看
I'll go check.

752
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:50,940
我想如果盖斯喜欢他  他一定不错
I guess if Gus likes him, he must be okay.

753
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,560
盖斯知道
Gus knows the difference between who's

754
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,940
混蛋和正常人的区别
an asshole and who's not, right?

755
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:54,940
没错
Right.

756
00:39:58,450 --> 00:39:59,450
这是什麽?
What are these?

757
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:00,950
一些照片
Just some photographs.

758
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:02,450
伪造点感情史很重要
It's important to create a history,

759
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:04,950
防止移民局随时来拜访
in case immigration ever decides to pay a visit.

760
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,960
天啊
Oh, Jesus!

761
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,960
我不敢相信你在准备这些
I can't believe you're going through with this...

762
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,960
这些  什麽?
This... what?

763
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,470
掩耳盗铃  而且为了谁?
Charade. And for who?

764
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:16,970
为了一个你不了解的人
Somebody you don't even know.

765
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:18,220
我告诉过你  是个朋友
I told you, he's a friend.

766
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:18,970
我不介意是谁
I don't care who he is.

767
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:21,470
这是我听过最疯狂的理由
It's the most meshugua idea I ever heard of.

768
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:22,970
我保证如果当时我在的话...
I guarantee you that if I had been here...

769
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,470
但你不在
Well, you're not.

770
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:25,480
你当时不在
You're not here.

771
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:30,980
我希望我在
I wish I was.

772
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:38,990
我很想你  琳
I miss you, Linz.

773
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:42,990
你只是因为吉拉姆才说的
You're just saying that because of Guillaume.

774
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,500
不是的
No, I'm not.

775
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,510
我每天
I miss you every minute...

776
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:57,010
每分钟 都想你
of every day.

777
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,510
我对你的思念无时无刻
And if I could miss you more than that, I would.

778
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:06,020
你以为我不想你吗?
You think I don't miss you?

779
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,520
那我为什麽不在这里?
Then why aren't I here? I mean...

780
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,520
为什麽我们不一起抚养他?
Why aren't we raising our son together?

781
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,520
这没道理
It doesn't make sense.

782
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,030
当时我们都有理由
Well, it did at the time.

783
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:18,530
你说的一切
I mean, all the things you said,

784
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:20,530
说我没有投入足够的感情
That I didn't give you enough affection...

785
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:21,750
我只想着
That I was only concerned about

786
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:23,030
满足自己的要求
getting my own needs met.

787
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,530
我错了  问题在我
I was wrong. It was me.

788
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:28,040
我变得妒忌  怨恨
I became... jealous and resentful and...

789
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,040
我要求的太多
I demanded way too much.

790
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,040
你很受伤
You were hurt.

791
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,040
你也是
So were you.

792
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,550
没错
Yeah.

793
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:43,550
-我想我们只是           -普通人?
-I guess we're only...  -Human?

794
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,060
没错
Yeah.

795
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,060
什麽?
Pardon?

796
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,060
你要喂盖斯吃午餐吗?
Uh, do you want to give Gus his lunch,

797
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,060
还是我来?
Or should I?

798
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,560
我来吧
I'll do it.

799
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,080
大家挥挥手吧
Okay, everybody wave.

800
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:14,080
来嘛  有点表示
Come on. Put something into it.

801
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,090
你们能做得更好
Oh, you can do better than that.

802
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:17,400
你以为我们是谁
Who do you think we are,

803
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,590
麦特戴蒙和班艾弗烈克？
Matt Damon and Ben Affleck?

804
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:20,090
我希望我是啊
I wish.

805
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:21,530
这样你们可以看到我们
Now you guys can see us

806
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:22,590
跑遍巴黎的每条街道
running all over the streets of Paris,

807
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:24,090
就像你们也和我们在那里一样
And it'll be just like you're there with us.

808
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:26,100
我都等不及了
Oh, I can hardly wait.

809
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,100
那个相机是最贵的型号
That camera is the most expensive model.

810
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,600
我爸有个类似的
My dad has one like it.

811
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,100
-我来拍             -好
- Let me have it.  - All right.

812
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,610
不只是电影里的镜头
Yeah, it not only shoots the movie,

813
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:38,110
还要有爆米花
It... it makes popcorn to go with it.

814
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:40,610
我猜不是在大Q超市买的
I guess you didn't get it at the big Q.

815
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:43,110
大卫喜欢高级货
David likes to go for the high-end.

816
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:45,110
那你要警惕了
That must keep you on your toes.

817
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:47,120
是件新夹克吗?
Hey, is that jacket new?

818
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,120
真时髦  迈克
Snazzy, Michael.

819
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,620
BOSS的  还不赖
Boss. Not bad.

820
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,620
我总得有件衣服可穿
Well, I had to have something to wear.

821
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,630
看看这个行李箱
Check out this luggage.

822
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:57,630
居然还有他的名字在上面
Oh! It's even got his initials on it.

823
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:00,630
-上帝啊        -才没有
- Oh, my god! - It does not.

824
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:04,130
我们在走流行路线了  对吧?
My, my. Certainly going in style, aren't we?

00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:06,640
你说我不应该拒绝他的

864
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,240

什麽?
What?

873
