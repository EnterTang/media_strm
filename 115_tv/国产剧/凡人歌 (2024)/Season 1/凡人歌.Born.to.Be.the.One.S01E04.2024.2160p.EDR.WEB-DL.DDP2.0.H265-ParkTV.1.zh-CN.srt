1
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,840
It's beautiful, isn't it?

2
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,520
It's all right.

3
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:52,200
<i>♪ I am the white side of the sun ♪</i>

4
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,280
Keep up.

5
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,080
<i>♪ Follow the beat across the light... ♪</i>

6
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,640
So what happens now?

7
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,480
Uh, I'll go find us somewhere.

8
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,520
Do you wanna wait here?

9
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,960
No way. I'm coming.

10
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,600
Can I take that?

11
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,240
Nope.

12
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,040
Right. Rule number one.
No flirting with me or with anyone else.

13
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,160
Well, that's easy. I don't flirt.

14
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,760
Here.

15
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,080
Well, there goes rule number two.

16
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,320
What time does the seminar start?

17
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,920
Oh. Depends.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,200
How long will it take you
to learn how to read?

19
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,640
There's that Northern charm.

20
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,680
Try this. Love and mortality
in communist Prague.

21
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,440
Ah. Well, this looks...

22
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,200
...unbearable.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,840
Factor 30?

24
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,880
I still burn.

25
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,160
I need cream. Everyone needs cream.

26
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,200
Can I help you?

27
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,160
Do you want me to do your back?

28
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,760
Go on, then.

29
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,960
Scooped quite low, isn't it?

30
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,200
Good job I didn't put it on backwards.

31
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,240
Excuse me.

32
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,200
- Hi there.
- Aren't you that bloke off the telly?

33
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,400
Uh... um, I might be.

34
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,840
<i>Largin' It,</i> isn't it?
The program you're on.

35
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,000
Yeah, that's the one.

36
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,120
I knew it. Are you on the TV too?

37
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,840
No, I work in a restaurant.

38
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,720
Well, part-time. As manager.

39
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,400
Packing it in soon, though.
Training to be a teacher.

40
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,200
- Uh...
- Maybe we'll see you lot later, then?

41
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,640
- Uh, grab a beer or something.
- Yeah.

42
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,920
Mm.

43
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,440
Oh my God.

44
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,280
What?

45
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,080
You appear to be very slightly famous.

46
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,560
Does that happen a lot?

47
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,680
No. No, that's never happened before.

48
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,760
Yeah.

49
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,240
- That was weird.
- By weird, do you mean amazing?

50
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,360
- What? Oh.
- Oh.

51
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,080
- Look at you. Delighted, I can see it.
- Shut up.

52
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,440
Absolutely bloody delighted!

53
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,680
Stop! Stop!

54
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,680
Last one in the sea's a minor celebrity.

55
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,960
- It's not gonna change you, is it?
- What?

56
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,160
Slight fame.

57
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,480
- God, I hate that word.
- What, "slight"?

58
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,880
Oh, come on.
You've probably never even watched it.

59
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,560
Course I've watched it.

60
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,800
And?

61
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,920
- Oh, just tell me what you think.
- Okay.

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,400
Well, I think the program's
a bit like being screamed at for an hour

63
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,600
by a drunk with a strobe light.

64
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,200
Okay. That's fair.

65
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,400
What about me?

66
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,520
I mean, am... am I any good as a presenter?

67
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,080
Yes.

68
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,040
Yeah, you're good. You... you are.

69
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,560
You're warm and funny, and...

70
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,600
I suppose some people
might even find you attractive.

71
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,720
Hmm.

72
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,280
- Look.
- What?

73
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,960
Naked!
Everyone on that beach is naked.

74
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,600
Should we?

75
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,320
What?

76
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,640
Go and join them. Move over to that beach.

77
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,720
Uh, alas, we're prevented by rule four.

78
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,160
No nudity.

79
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,040
It's not a rule. It's a guideline.

80
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,000
No, it's a rule.

81
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,680
Well, we've already broken the bed one.

82
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
So...

83
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,120
All the more reason
to rigorously enforce the rest.

84
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,640
Why don't you go?
I'll try to tear my eyes away.

85
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,600
I just thought
we might be more comfortable.

86
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,920
More comfortable?

87
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,280
No, I don't think
I would be more comfortable.

88
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,920
Besides, I don't think your girlfriend
would be very pleased.

89
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,160
Ah, Ingrid wouldn't care.

90
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,360
She's very open-minded, Ingrid.

91
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,040
She'd have had her top off in departures.

92
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,560
Of course,
there's not much I haven't seen.

93
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,200
What's that?

94
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,800
I'm just saying.

95
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,880
Remember? Grad ball?

96
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,400
If I close my eyes,
I can still picture it.

97
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,840
Mm. Oh my God.

98
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,720
Yep. Our one night of love.

99
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,120
Oy!

100
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,160
There you are,
in your nuclear disarmament T-shirt.

101
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,240
Mm, drunk.

102
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,640
- Not that drunk.
- Mm, drunk enough.

103
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,520
In fact, I've blanked it out.
Like a car crash.

104
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,520
It was a fun night. Come on.

105
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,840
You, with your big dreams
and your washed-out C&A pants.

106
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,360
What?

107
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,920
You.

108
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,800
"C&A pants." You're funny sometimes.

109
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,440
Am I?

110
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,880
Yeah. Every now and then.

111
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,760
Hmm.

112
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,800
You should be on TV.

113
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,800

Oh fuck.

130
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,320
- It's free.
- Hmm?

131
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,360
Maybe we should just stay here all week.

132
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,960
Not island-hop. Just stay here.

133
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,920
Maybe.

134
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,160
You think you'd get bored?

135
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,800
Uh-uh.

136
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,680
Happy, then?

137
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,400
So what now?

138
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,000
Whatever you want.

139
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,200
Hmm...

140
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,160
Scrabble.

141
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,880
Uh, this was expressly negotiated.

142
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,320
Rule five.

143
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,200
Was that a rule?
I thought it was more of a guideline.

144
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,360
Okay. Dinner, then. I'm starving.

145
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,880
Done.

146
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,520
Apparently, they have this thing
called "Greek salad."

147
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,240
<i>Do you think
we'll get sick of each other,</i>

148
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,600
<i>staying here for eight days?</i>

149
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,760
<i>No.</i>

150
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,680
<i>We might.</i>

151
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,960
<i>And in case we do...</i>

152
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,120
<i>...I had an idea.</i>

153
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,280
Let's tell each other something
that the other person doesn't know.

154
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,000
Like a secret?

155
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,120
Like a secret.

156
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,000
Every night for the rest of the holiday.

157
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,640
- Cool. Okay.
- Mm-hmm?

158
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,560
You first.

159
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,480
- No, no. You first.
- Why me first?

160
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,120
'Cause you've got
a bottomless supply to choose from.

161
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,160
Okay.

162
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,440
Hmm.

163
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,760
Okay, here goes.

164
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,840
Mm-hmm?

165
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,920
I got off with a guy.

166
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,640
I mean, it... it wasn't a big deal.
I was off my face, but...

167
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,880
Continue.

168
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,400
Uh, well, I was on this hard-core night.

169
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,360
"Sex Face," in a club called Strap
in Vauxhall.

170
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,080
"Sex Face" at Strap?

171
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,480
Anyway, I was there
with Ingrid and some of her mates,

172
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,120
and I was dancing,
and this guy comes up to me,

173
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,240
chaps and a harness, and...

174
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,120
...he just started kissing me,
so I kissed him back.

175
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,560
And, um, did you enjoy it?

176
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,680
It was all right.
I mean, a mouth's just a mouth.

177
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,880
Oh, "A mouth is just a mouth."

178
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,760
- Dex, you have the soul of a poet.
- You know what I mean.

179
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,400
What did Ingrid say?

180
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,920
She just laughed. She doesn't mind.

181
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,480
She's bisexual, anyway.

182
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,520
Yeah, of course. Course she is.

183
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,280
That's what we're supposed to do
at our age, isn't it?

184
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Experimenting?

185
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,880
Are we?

186
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,600
No one tells me anything.

187
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,160
Don't give me that...
that robot nun routine.

188
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,600
You must have got up to stuff. So come on.

189
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,360
Your turn.

190
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,960
Mm. Okay.

191
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,920
Yeah. Let me think.

192
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,240
Go on.

193
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,160
After we met at graduation,

194
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,800
before we became, you know, pals...

195
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,280
...I had a bit of a crush on you.

196
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,840
Well, not a <i>bit</i> of a crush, actually.

197
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,360
A massive crush, for ages.

198
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,720
I wrote poetry and everything.

199
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,400
Poetry?

200
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,040
Yeah, I'm not proud of myself.

201
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,960
Well, I'm sorry, Em, but...

202
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,200
that doesn't count.

203
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,600
Why not?

204
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,080
Because you said it had to be something
that the other person didn't know.

205
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,200
Oh my God, you're so annoying.

206
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,840
- How did you know?
- Tilly told me.

207
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,480
Oh God, Tilly.

208
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,520
So what happened to it? This crush?

209
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,040
Just suppose it was something
you get over in time. Like shingles.

210
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,400
No, really. What happened?

211
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,120
I got to know you.

212
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,080
And then...

213
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,040
cured.

214
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,440

It's so warm!

245
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,160
Come on, Em.
Before the sun comes up.

246
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,160
So this is it, then?

247
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,160
- What is?
- Skinny-dipping.

248
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,240
It is. What do you think?

249
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,440
Very larky!

250
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,600
That's a very soulful face.

251
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,880
- You're not doing a wee, are ya?
- No.

252
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,360
No.

253
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,160
Sorry for being a bit dickish
in the restaurant.

254
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,480
It's all right. I'm used to it.

255
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,120
I mean, I felt the same.

256
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,080
I didn't write any poetry or anything,
but I fancied you.

257
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,800
I fancy you.

258
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,480
It's just my problem is that I...

259
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,400
...I fancy pretty much everyone.

260
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,560
I just don't think
I'm ready for a relationship.

261
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,280
I... I think, um...

262
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,760
I think we'd want different things.

263
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,920
But if you...

264
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,560
if you wanted a bit of fun,

265
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,280
no strings, no obligations,

266
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,320
I'd be up for it.

267
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,480
I'll take that as a "No, thanks."

268
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,000
It's weird, you know.

269
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,520
How you like to keep me warm.

270
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,600
What?

271
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,520
It's like you want me to still fancy you.

272
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,040
Like it's a...

273
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,640
a necessary condition
of the cosmos or something.

274

That I should always just be
off to one side somewhere,

275
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,320
twinkling away for you.

276
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,960
Em, I don't think that's true.

277
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,120
You're... You're not, though, are you?

278
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,080
Twinkling?

279
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,600
No.
