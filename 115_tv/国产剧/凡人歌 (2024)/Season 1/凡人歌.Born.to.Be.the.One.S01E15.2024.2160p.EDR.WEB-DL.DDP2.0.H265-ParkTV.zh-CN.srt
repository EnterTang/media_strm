同志亦凡人 Queer As Folk S01E15

4
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,260
他十一点左右要小睡一下
So he takes a nap around 11:00,

5
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,840
到了三点还要睡一会儿
And another one around 3:00.

6
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,840
真不赖
Lucky him.

7
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,510
咕噜  咕噜  咕噜
Glug, glug, glug.

00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,060
还有紧急联络的号码

噢  如果你要带他出去
Oh, and if you want to take him outside,

10
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,870
别忘了帮他戴上小童帽
Don't forget to put his little beanie hat on.

11
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,900
他真是可爱
He looks so adorable.

12
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,100
有人看到过我的另一只鞋了吗
Has anyone, uh, seen my other shoe?

13
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,970
是这个在我屁股下的东西吗?
Ah, is that what I'm sitting on?

14
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,190
我就知道这不是我常用的橡胶玩具 (假阳具)
I knew it wasn't one of my usual rubber toys.

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,690
布莱恩  你有在认真听吗
Brian, are you listening to me?

16
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,980
有  吃饭时间

00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,140
我会好好照顾他的  琳赛
He's going to be fine, Lindsay.

20
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,290
我相信你
I know he will be.

21
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,020
仓促通知下你也肯帮忙  我很感激
And I appreciate you doing this on such short notice.

22
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,740
但我现在得回去工作了
But now that I have to go back to work,

23
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,160
不得不去参加这个该死的教师会议
I have to attend this damn teachers' conference.

24
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,190
也许你能邂逅一个漂亮的美女体育老师
Well, maybe you'll meet a nice lady P.E. Teacher.

25
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,440
不用担心
Don't worry.

26
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,160
我也会帮忙看着他的
I'll keep an eye on him too.

27
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,000
我才不需要你来帮忙看着他
I don't need you to keep an eye on him.

28
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:34,500
我是说看着你
I meant you.

29
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,230
我是他爸  我能照顾好他
I'm his father, I'm not going to fuck it up.

30
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,800
你能说服他们信任我吗
Would you please tell them to give me some credit?

31
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,600
我信任你
I am.

32
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,250
所以我才把他交给你
That's why I'm leaving him in your care.

33
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,010
屁话
Bullshit.

34
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,050
你之所以把他交给我
You're leaving him with me

35
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,940
是因为茉蕾妮去迈阿密看她的长舌妇老妈
Because Melanie's going to go see her yenta mother In Miami

36
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,300
礼拜天之前都回不来

这是我开会地方的电话号码
Here's my number at the conference.

38
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,350
给你

00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,690
他不会有事的  孩子的娘
He's going to be fine, mom.

40
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,120
我知道  孩子的爸

00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,520
我爱你
Love you.

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,920
准备好跟你老爸一起
Are you ready to spend a weekend

43
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,850
度过一个愉快的周末了吗  阳光小宝贝

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,930

You want to give me a hand with some of this stuff, please?

46
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,630
拜托  客房都被塞满了
Come on, I know there's a guest room up here somewhere.

47
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,300
抱歉  我本要把我的东西清一清的
I'm sorry, I was going to move some of my stuff.

48
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,720
- 所以，他几点钟到             -七点半
- So, when's he arriving?  - 7:30.

49
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,390
如果飞机准时的话
If the plane's on time.

50
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,700
你一定很兴奋吧
You must be pretty excited.

51
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,970
我整个夏天都盼着今天呢
I've been counting the days all summer.

52
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,140
望眼欲穿啊
That's a long time.

53
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,970
是啊  俄勒冈离这儿很远
Yeah, well, Oregon's a long way away.

54
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,530
幸亏有电子邮件
Thank god for e-mail.

55
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,910
我还在他的好友列表里呢
I'm on his buddy list.

56
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,640
-你一定会爱上我儿子                              -酷
-God, you're going to love my son.  -Cool.

57
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,970
你真该见见这孩子  他太棒了
You should see this kid. He-he's amazing.

58
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,240
他聪明  他风趣
He's smart, he's funny.

59
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,860
他  他会吹高音萨克斯  他会做网站
He... h-he plays tenor sax, he can do web sites,

60
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,610
他还会杂耍
He can... he juggles.

61
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,440
真强  那他还有时间做脑科手术吗？
Great. When does he find time for brain surgery?

62
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,280
啊  他听起来很了不起
Ah... he sounds marvellous.

63
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,560
他是了不起
He is.

64
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,190
他会喜欢你的
He's going to love you too.

65
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,200
你又知道了
How do you know that?

66
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,400
谁不呢?
Who wouldn't?

67
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,740
我没看过你穿这件
I have not seen these before.

68
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,670
未来，如果你够幸运的话
Well one day, if you're lucky,

69
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,140
你可能会看到
You just might.

70
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,130
-工作愉快                                 -你也是
-Have a good day at work.  -You too.

71
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,040
你就不能穿的更低调一些吗
Couldn't you have worn something a little more discreet?

72
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,230
只要盖住你黑色三角地带
As long as your erogenous zones are covered,

73
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,890
你就算得上穿着保守了
you're safely in the conservative column.

74
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,270
而且我也试过异性恋那套什麽「见到曙光」的狗屁
Besides, I tried straight drag, "saw the light".

75
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,050
谢天谢地
Thank you, god.

嗯  寿司怎麽样
How about, uh, sushi?

79
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,560
啊  食物中毒 正是我需要的
Ah, just what I need, food poisoning.

80
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:44,700
好吧  印度菜呢
Okay, Indian?

81
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,000
胃食道逆流
Heartburn.

82
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,050
-猪排呢    -心脏病

87
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,180

上次听到你的消息

97
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,220
说你要在巴尔的摩开公司
You were setting up offices in Baltimore?

98
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,860
还有辛辛那提  现在发展到这儿了

106
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,160
刚好，我得和一个客户去吃饭
Listen, I, uh, got to meet a client for lunch,

嗯…他真帅
Hmm, he's cute.

115
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,370
我以前也那麽觉得
I thought so too.

116
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,430
听说他是个行动派
I hear he's a real mover.

117
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,560
30岁之前就成了百万富翁

119

我永远也无法知道
I'll probably never know.

120
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,210
这个12岁的魔术师
And apparently this 12-year-old juggling,

121
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,330
还会玩爵士乐的网路天才
Jazz-playing web-master...

122

他要是讨厌我怎麽办？
What if he hates me?

123
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,000
谁啊
Who?

124
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,300
-大卫的儿子     - 去他的  只不过是个孩子
- David's son.  - Fuck him, he's just a kid.

他不只是个孩子  他是大卫的孩子
He's not just a kid, he's David's son.

126
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,850
你知道这意味着什麽
And you know what that means.

127
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,220
你就是那个恶毒的後母

128
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,190
什麽

像童话故事里的一样
Like in fairy tales.

131
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,470
你怎麽不带着你故事书回去工作？
Well, why don't you get your fairy tail back to work.

132
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,760
不是还有很多马桶等着你刷亮吗
Isn't there a toilet you need to spit-shine?

133
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,840
别这麽可怜兮兮  小迈  他才不会讨厌你
Don't be so pathetic, Mikey. He's not going to hate you.

134
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,230
你怎麽知道
Well, what makes you so sure?

135
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,880
连我都爱死你了
I'm crazy about you.

136
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,310
你这是怎麽了
What is with you?

137

我就是…那个後母

我  是那个後母

谁是後母
Who's a stepmother?

141
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,780
小迈

Huh?

144
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,610
你怎麽会这麽想呢？
What do you think of that?

145
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,970
看看你呀  你真漂亮
Look at you, you're so beautiful.

146

我发誓  布莱恩

他会一天天地更像你
He's getting to look more like you every day, yes.

148
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,240

Yeah, well, we're still working on the hair.

149
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,420
琳赛去哪儿了
Where's Lindsay?

150
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,840
她去开一个教师会议
She's at a teachers' conference,

151
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:07,070
所以这周末我来照顾他
So I'm watching him for the weekend.

152
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,330
你?
You?

153
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,960
我连植物都不放心给你照顾
I'd be afraid to let you water my plants.

154
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,660
你知道帮宝适是什麽吗
Do you even know what a Huggie is?

155
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,910
那可不是什麽性爱体位
It's not a sexual position.

156
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,380
我当然知道  那是  呃
Of course I do. It's, um, uh...

157
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,380
一种尿布
A diaper!

158
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,690
噢  是的
Oh... yeah,

159
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,620
我最了解尿布了
I know all about diapers.

160
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,810
我和一个大公司的总裁
I was fucking this guy for a while,

161
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,460
胡搞过一阵子
CEO of a big corporation.

162
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,440
他喜欢上穿着尿布  要我打他的屁股
He used to like to wear diapers when I spanked him.

163
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,550
恶心
Gross.

164
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:32,640
变态
It's kinky.

165
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,910
这周末不是皮衣舞会吗
Isn't this weekend the leather ball?

166
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,320
我还以为你会忙着参加呢
I would think that your dance card would be full.

167
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,180
我知道  那很有诱惑力  但是
I know, it's tempting, but...

168
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,580
今年
This year,

169
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,830
我得把我的皮内裤
I'm trading in my leather jockstrap...

170
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,110
换成
For...

171
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,900
尿不湿
Rubber pants.

172
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,930
对不对呢  小宝贝儿
Isn't that right, sonny-boy?

173
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,620
请弗兰克·劳德乘客到美国航空的

185
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,340
我为这个周末
I got a whole... A whole list of activities

186
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,440
安排了很多活动
That we're going to do this week.

187
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,200
一定会很充实的
Just... just chock full.

188
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,290
很酷啊  对吧
Cool, huh?

189
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:38,810
对啊  很酷
Yeah. Cool.

190
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,620
在科学中心有一个新的展览

191
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,450
我想去看看
That I want to see.

192
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,180
还有孟农加希拉登山车
And the monongahela incline,

193
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,080
坐在上面俯瞰
It's like this, uh, cable car

194
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,310
能饱览整个城市风景
that has these incredible views of the city.

195
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,240
还有我听说有一面新的攀岩墙
Plus there's a rock-climbing wall that I heard about,

196
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,790
我也想去爬爬看
and I want to check that out.

197
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,000
盖斯  来  吸它
Gus, come on. Take it.

198
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,590
看  看
Look, look.

199
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,120
这是你的奶嘴
It's your pacifier.

200
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,790
你得给我吸
You should be sucking it.

201
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,970
终於他妈的来了
It's about fucking time.

202
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,460
我一个小时之前就订餐了
I ordered an hour ago.

203
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:17,960
盖斯
Gus...

204
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,960
把它想像成  乳头
Think... nipple.

205
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,560
想像成老二
Think cock.

206
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,280
想像成什麽都行  只要能吸
Whatever... whatever gets you there.

207
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,740
来  来
Come on, come on.

208
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,860
来
Come on.

209
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,060
你的老爸也不是这麽逊嘛
Your old man's not so bad at this.

210
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,810
这次他们最好别忘了
They'd better not have forgot the

211
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,520
带芝麻面过来
fucking sesame noodles this time.

212
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,810
都等了好久了  我订了...
It's about time, I ordered...

213
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,600
嘿  宝贝儿子
Hey, sonny-boy.

214
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,570
耶稣
Jesus.

215
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,690
如果真是耶稣来  你也不会那麽惊讶吧
Yeah, well, you couldn't be more surprised if it was.

216
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,140
让我进来吗
You gonna let me in?

217
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,780
当然可以
Uh, s-sure.

218
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,660
不错的地方
Hey. Some place.

219
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,850
跟宫殿一样富丽堂皇
Big as a palace.

220
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,870
虽然从外面看像一个垃圾场
Looks like a dump from the outside.

221
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,500
这小孩是谁
Hey, who's this?

222
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,380
这是盖斯  他是
Uh, this is gus. Uh, he's...

223
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,060
琳赛的小孩  你记得琳赛吧
Lindsay's kid. You remember lindsay?

224
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,710
那个高高的金发女人？
Ah. Tallish, blonde?

225
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,720
你以前和她约会过
You used to take her out.

226
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,390
她是个很漂亮的女孩
She was a pretty girl.

227
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,830
还有一个这麽大的可爱儿子
She's got one helluva cute son.

228
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,690
她把小孩丢给你照顾吗
She leaves him with you?

229
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,810
有时候会
Sometimes.

230
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,780
所以你没事来市区里闲晃吗？
So what're you doing, wandering around town?

231
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,280
想找个红粉知己吗?
A lady friend?

232
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,050
不觉得有点太老了吗？
Aren't you a little bit old for that?

233
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,310
不是这个
That's not it.

234
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:47,850
需要钱
Need money?

235
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,970
不  我不是来向你要钱
No, I didn't come for your fucking money.

236
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,210
老妈终於离开你了吗
Mom finally leave you?

237
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,550
我得了癌症
I've got cancer.

238
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,060
本来只有在肺部
It started in my lungs,

239
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,650
不过现在已经扩散了
But it's already spread.

240
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,360
我高明的
My brilliant...

241
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,420
医生去年夏天给我做的检查
Doctors discovered it on an x-ray during my...

242
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,690
照X光时发现的
Physical last summer.

243
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,910
现在扩散到全身了
Now, seems it's everywhere.

244
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,900
很抱歉
Sorry.

245
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,760
我本想让那个圣女告诉你的  (瓦尔登湖)
I would rather the Warden do the honours,

246
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:19,710
但是你妈坚持要我亲自告诉你和你姐
but she insisted I tell you and your sister in person.

247
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,610
所以我亲自过来了
So you're hearing it from me.

248
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,490
谢谢
Thanks.

249
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,360
你好
Hello?

250
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,600
芝麻面  这次没忘
Sesame noodle. Didn't forget this time.

251
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,760
要知道迈克几周前才搬进来
You know, Michael just moved in a few weeks ago.

252
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:38,720
所以这里有一些好玩的东西
That's why, uh, the funny things that you see around here,

253
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,940
像是星际船长  那是
Like captain Astro, that's, uh...

254
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,460
那是他的东西
That's his.

255
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,570
他一定比我想的还要年轻
Must be even younger than I thought.

256
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,590
思科涨了  太棒了
Cisco's up. Cool!

257
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,140
你在看股票专页吗
You read the stock page?

258
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,350
你不看吗
Don't you?

259
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,680
我喜欢看体育专栏
Uh, I stick to sports.

260
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,500
克劳奇麦片  还是你的最爱吧
Captain Crunch. Still your favourite?

261
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:03,380
我现在只吃脱脂、无糖的有机麦片
Actually, I eat nonfat, sugar free, organic mueslix.

262
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,400
这样啊
Well...

263
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,160
怪不得你长这麽快
That would explain why you've grown so much.

264
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,860
自从上次见到你到现在
You've probably grown a foot

265
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,780
我估计你已经长高30公分了
since the last time I saw you.

266
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,870
我现在穿六号的鞋
I wear a size six shoe now.

267
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,020
爸爸给我买了这双很炫的爱迪达
Dad bought me these awesome Adidas...

268
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,040
我是说  盖瑞
I mean, Gary.

269
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,300
也许我可以给你买一条很酷的裤子
Maybe I'll buy you an awesome pair of pants

270
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,710
来配这双鞋
To go with those.

271
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,560

Okay.

275
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,240

00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,620
吃点早餐  我们20分钟後就出发
Get yourself some breakfast.We're leaving in 20 minutes.

277
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,450

- What's the rush? - What's the rush?

278
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,430
我可不想浪费时间
I don't want to waste any time.

279
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,320
我们有太多的事要做
 We got a million things to do.

280
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,020
我去拿钱包  你们穿好衣服
I'll get my wallet, you guys get dressed.

281
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,810
见到你爸爸你一定很开心吧
So you must be happy to see your dad, huh?

282
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,510
他最近一直都在说你要来的事
He's been, uh, talking about your visit non-stop.

283
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,700
-他真的很兴奋              - 听着
- He's really excited... - look,

284
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:11,220
我不想来这儿  知道吗  一点也不想
I didn't want to come here okay? At all.

285
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,070
是妈逼我来的
My mom made me.

286
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,650
所以回去之前我只能装模作样
So I'll just have to put up with it until I can go home.

287
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,160
大伙儿
Guys!

288
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,340
快点  快动起来
Come on, let's go.

289
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,720
换件衣服  我们有一整天要玩的
Get dressed, we got a big day.

290
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,280
匹兹堡正等着我们呢
Pittsburgh's waiting for us.

291
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,310
你想要什麽口味的松饼阿?
How do you want your waffles?

292
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,340
加桃子和橙酒  还是有樱桃和莱姆?
In peaches and grand marnier, or cherries and rum?

293
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,770
松饼大师  不如别弄松饼了
Better yet, Wolfgang, why don't you skip the waffles?

294
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,690
送上酱汁就好了
And just serve the sauce...

295
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,150
别混在一起
Straight up.

296
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,120
盖斯刚刚吐了
Gus just puked...

297
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,680
全部吐在了我身上
All over me.

298
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,920
婴儿经常会那样的
Babies do that. Mmm.

299
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,690
全吐在了我最喜欢的夹克上
All over my favourite leather jacket.

300
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,190
已经会评论时尚了呢
A fashion critic already.

301
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,480
看谁在这儿啊
Look who's here!

302
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,400
我能抱抱他吗
Oh, can I hold him?

303
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,390
当然  请自便
Yeah, be my guest.

304
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,830
你看你
Oh, look at you.

305
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,970
你看你
Huh? Oh, look at you.

306
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,600
你还好吗  帅哥盖斯
How are you, gorgeous gus?

307
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:09,470
过来
Come here.

308
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,540
他好极了    但我想他大概想妈妈了
He's aces. But I suspect he misses his mother's touch.

309
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,790
我来照顾他
Ah, well I'll take care of that.

310
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,420
-你知道吗         -宝贝
- You know...  - Hi, baby.

311
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,310
如果你想发挥母爱
If you'd be interested in satisfying

312
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,220
发挥你的母性光辉一段时间
your maternal urges for a longer period of time,

313
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,740
比如花一个晚上
Recreating the amber hues of Michael's childhood

314
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,310
重温一下迈克琥珀色的童年
for an entire evening, for instance...

315
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,550
这倒是可以的
That could be arranged.

316
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,070
你想去皮衣舞会  是吧
You want to go to the leather ball, huh?

317
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,590
-什麽都瞒不了你           -当然了
- Hmm, you're good.  -Yeah.

318
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,460
但是你找错保姆了
But you're barking up the wrong babysitter.

319
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,990
因为今晚我要去上夜班  对吧
Cause I've got the graveyard shift at the diner, don't I?

320
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,850
我马上回来
I'll be back.

321
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,910
一定要用瓶装水把它们冲下去
Be sure and wash them down with bottled water,

322
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,340
不要用萨斯奎汉的烂货
not that shit from the Susquehanna.

323
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,500
好的  好的  好的
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

324
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,590
就知道敷衍我
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

325
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,980
-是啊      -艾滋病患的生活一定很艰难
-Yeah.   - Must be tough living with that.

326
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:12,880
布莱恩
Brian?

327
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,310
亲爱的  你不会是...
Honey... you're not...

328
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,090
才不是
Hmm. No.

329
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,690
但我爸  得了癌症
But my dad's... got cancer.

330
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,350
-你爸病了吗             - 他昨天晚上来我家
- Your dad's sick?  - He came over last night...

331
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,330
告诉我这个消息
to tell me that.

332
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:32,960
我真的很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

333
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,470
他还能活多久？
How long's he got?

334
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,470
顶多几个月吧
Couple months, tops.

335
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,150
那麽
Well, then...

336
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,960
如果你不介意
If you don't mind some free advice

337
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,620
我这个比你更了解你自已的人
From someone who's known you a lot longer

338
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,130
给你个良心的建议
Than you've known yourself,

339
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,520
你应该告诉他
You should tell him.

340
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,110
告诉他什麽
Tell him what?

341
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:59,290
别装傻  你知道我说什麽
You know damn well, don't play dumb.

342
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,120
他亲自告诉你生病的事
He made a very big gesture

343
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,730
代表他很在乎你
In telling you about himself.

344
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,860
我说你应该礼尚往来
I'm saying you should return the favour.

345
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,460
绝不可能
No fucking way.

346
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,030
29年来他对我的生活一无所知
My father hasn't known anything about my life for 29 years,

347
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,120
也不在乎
Or cared.

348
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,560
我何必现在要说？
Why should I bother now?

349
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,710
因为这对你有好处的
Because it's good for you.

350
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,670
告诉一个垂死的人我是同性恋吗
To tell a dying man I'm queer?

351
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,870
我是指诚实
To be honest.

352
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,600
我一直都很诚实
I'm always honest.

353
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,100
你以为你很诚实
You think you are.

354
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,490
如果父亲连进了坟墓还不知道
How honest is it to let your father go to his grave

355
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,680
自已儿子的本性  这算哪门子诚实
without ever really knowing who his son is,

356
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,010
亲爱的
honey?

357
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,160
听着  我知道你觉得他从没爱过你
Look, I know you think he never loved you.

358
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,690
但这也许是一个让他理解你的方法
But it might be a way to get through to him.

359
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,770
不管怎麽样
For whatever it's worth,

360
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,350
别让一切太晚
before it's too late.

361
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,160
如果我需要一个心里师
If I wanted a therapist,

362
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:56,480
我会自己到分类广告去找
I'd look in the fucking yellow pages.

363
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,080
对啊  但是我可便宜得多
Yeah, but I'm a hell of a lot cheaper,

364
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,810
而且我不暑休的
And I don't take off August.

365
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,440
我想他饿了
I-I bet he's hungry.

366
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,130
我能喂他吗
Can I feed him?

367
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,980
你今晚准备干什麽
What are you doing tonight?

368
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,020
那水族馆很炫吧
Huh! isn't that aquarium incredible?

369
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,130
我可以一辈子都盯着那些鱼缸
I mean, I could stare at those fish tanks forever.

370
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,250
看起来过了很久
It just seemed that long.

371
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,610
但其实还不到5个小时
Actually, it was just under five hours.

372
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,510
太好了  要知道我喜欢大家一起出来玩儿
This is so great. I mean, I love being together, you know,

373
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,720
彼此分享  就你  我和迈克三个人一起
Sharing this, just you and me and michael.

374
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,510
是啊  太棒了
Yeah. Great. Ah.

375
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,620
我们可以休息一下吃个午餐吗
Can we take a break for lunch soon?

376
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,910
看着那些鱼让我想吃鸡肉了
Um, looking at all those fish made me hungry for chicken.

377
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,440
开玩笑吧  我们还得去博物馆
Are you kidding me? We've got to get to the museum.

378
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,740
那儿有个恐龙展览
There's a dinosaur exhibit.

379
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,850
自从三年级後我就不喜欢恐龙了
Ah, I haven't been into dinosaurs since, like, third grade.

380
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,040
哈  我喜欢恐龙
Ha! I love dinosaurs.

381
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,300
了解一种比我还老的生物  这种感觉很好
It's nice to know there's a creature Actually older than me.

382
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,130
不管怎麽样  看完恐龙後
Anyway, after that,

383
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,130
我们可以去高尔夫球场
We can go to the driving range.

384
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,230
不  不  去棒球场
No, the... no, the batting cage

385
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,370
你妈说你击球很准
'Cause your mother tells me your swing's really coming along.

386
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,080
我们正好可以去试试
And there's this arcade that I want to check out.

387
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,590
我听说那里很不错
I... I hear it's really fantastic.

388
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,550
我想我们可以去看看
I guess we'll... we'll find out.

389
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,040
真不敢相信
I can't believe you actually went out

390
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,550
你居然穿成这样出来见人
in public dressed like that.

391
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,060
我妈常说
My mother used to say,

392
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,410
"尽情挥撒自已的色彩  年轻不要留白"
"Find your best feature and play it for all it's worth."

393
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,740
我就是这样做的
So that's exactly what I did.

394
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,700
再说  这是皮衣舞会
Besides, it's called the leather ball.

395
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:26,150
你起码要穿得合情合理吧
You could have at least dressed for the occasion.

396
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,240
我有啊  我系了皮带
I did. I wore a leather belt.

397
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,990
你可真够保守
You are such a stick in the mud.

398
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,250
怎麽？  就因为我不想  打扮成...
Why? Because I-I don't want to... look like a... cross

399
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,520
纳粹冲锋队和罗伊·罗杰斯的杂交种吗？  (牛仔歌星)
between a Nazi storm trooper and... Roy Rogers?

400
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,320
闭嘴吧  我听得都勃起了
Mm, stop it, you're giving me a hard-on.

401
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,920
希望他能有点教养
I hope he's housebroken.

402
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,170
说实话  这些人太奇怪了
Honestly, these people a-are too weird.

403
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,910
你好啊  翘臀君
Hello, pig bottom.

404
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:58,850
想不想舌吻我的皮靴啊
How would you like to polish my boot with your tongue?

405
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,380
我说吧
Like I said.

406
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,700
你怎麽来了  你不是要照顾盖斯吗
What are you doing here? I thought you had Gus.

407
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,130
我找了个保姆
I found a sitter.

408
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,750
你们玩吧
Enjoy, you guys.

409
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,060
你去哪
Where're you going?

410
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,350
回家
Home.

411
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,900
回去睡我的皮沙发
To my leather recliner.

412
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,980
那沙发都跟我一样扭曲了
That's as kinky as I get.

413
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,900
开始吧
Let's go!

414
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,940
天啊  那不是
Oh my God, isn't that...

415
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,120
戴尔·威克斯勒吗
Dale Wexler?

416
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,500
这下你知道他其中一个小秘密了吧
Well, now you know one of his secrets, don't you?

417
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,980
今天过得真愉快
That was quite a day, huh?

418
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,180
扯淡  我在12个小时里
No shit. I saw more of Pittsburgh in 12 hours

419
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,290
看到的匹兹堡风景比我这一生还多
Than I've seen in my entire life.

420
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:26,140
每次我看到他  他都不一样
You know, every time I see him, he's different.

421
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,450
我得牺牲我们在一起的时间
And I have to spend the couple of days that we have together

422
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,850
在汉克改变之前了解他的变化
trying to get to know the "new Hank" before he's gone again.

423
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,440
-迈克          -嗯？
-Michael? -Huh?

424
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,800
你上床之前不是应该
Aren't you supposed to take off your clothes

425
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,050
脱衣服吗
Before you come to bed?

426
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,390
别抓狂    只是...
Don't flip out, um... but I...

427
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,150
我想今晚回家睡
I think I should go stay at my old place tonight.

428
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,410
你在说什麽  为什麽
What are you talking about, what for?

429
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,610
我觉得我在这住  汉克会不舒服
I think Hank's uncomfortable with me here.

430
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,530
你怎麽会这麽想？  他跟你讲的吗
Where did you get that idea? Did he tell you that?

431
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,240
他没跟我讲
Well, not in so many words.

432
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,650
但是  那些沉默
But, you know, the silences

433
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,150
已经告诉我一切了
Told me everything I needed to know.

434
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:02,800
好吧
Well...

435
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,700
你应该给他点时间
You got to give him some time, you know,

436
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,760
来了解你
to get to know you.

437
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,440
我觉得他不想了解我
I don't think he wants to get to know me,

438
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:08,470
你知道  我并不怪他
You know. And I don't blame him.

439
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,900
这种「汉克有两个老爸」的事
This whole "Hank has two daddies" thing

440
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,900
对一个孩子来说  太难接受
Is too much for any kid.

441
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,590
我和马克在一起的时候  他很好啊
He had no problem when I was with Mack.

442
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,300
恕我直言
Well, no offense, but you know,

443
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,240
汉克当时还小
Hank was a lot younger then, you know.

444
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,570
他现在长大了  开始知道性取向是什麽
Now he's older, and he's starting to define his sexuality,

445
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,110
我敢说  看到他爸
I'm sure it's pretty unsettling

446
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,570
和男朋友在一起一定很不舒服
To see his dad and his new male lover.

447
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,830
唯一能让他接受我们的方法
The only way he's going to get used to us

448
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,140
就是让你留在他身边
is by having you around.

449
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:34,640
我们能不能  让他慢慢地接受我们
Well... can't we... can't we ease him into it? You know,

450
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,880
一开始我先友情客串
start out with a guest appearance

451
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:38,330
然後再和你联合演出
and then build me up to a co-starring role?

452
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,840
你哪也去不了
You're not going anywhere.

453
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,080
只要几个晚上就成
It'll only be for a couple of nights.

454
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,760
不  一个晚上也不行
No, not even for one night.

455
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,340
汉克会习惯的
Hank's going to be fine.

456
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,640
我们也是
And so are we.

457
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:56,910
现在
Now...

458
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,660
把这些脱了
Let's get you out of these,

459
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,560
然後上床吧
and into bed.

460
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,760
这个还是留着吧
I thought those might make an appearance.

461
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,740
泰德
Ted?

462
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,530
-嘿  戴尔         - 我就知道是你
- Hey, Dale!  - I thought that was you.

463
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,300
然後我又对自己说
Then I said to myself,

464
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:35,060
"等等  不会吧  不会是泰德·施密特吧"
"Wait a minute, it can't be. Not, uh, Ted Schmidt."

465
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,750
真是个惊喜啊
Ahh. Well, this is a surprise.

466
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:41,330
所以老爹　你是主人还是奴隶呢？
So, you, uh, daddy, a master... slave?

467
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,760
以上皆非
Actually, none of the above.

468
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:45,010
我只是来观摩
I... I'm here just as an observer.

469
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,090
一开始大家都这麽说
Yeah, that's what they all say.

470
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,560
接着他们自动躺上吊床
Next thing you know, there they are in a sling,

471
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,280
鼻子吸着RUSH
with a bottle of poppers stuck up their nose

472
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:52,180
被五个大汉轮流拳交
and five guys fisting them.

473
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,690
我保证  我不会那样
I guarantee you, that's not the case with me.

474
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,700
是我朋友硬把我拖来的
A-a friend... dragged me here.

475
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:00,260
鲍勃牛仔把我套住了
Um, cowboy Bob lassoed me.

476
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,220
他说要把我带到马厩去
He's promised to take me out to the stable,

477
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,780
把我像头哀嚎的猪一样绑起来  烙印我呢
tie me up like a squealing pig, and brand me.

478
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,770
快死过来  你这小杂种狗
You'd better git-along, little doggie!

479
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,730
那位就是...
Uh... that's my friend who...

480
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,010
拖我来的朋友
Who dragged me here.

481
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,880
现在他被拖走了  真好运
Now he's being dragged away. Lucky him.

482
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,360
耶…  听着  我相信还有别的奴隶
Yeah well, uh, look, I-I'm sure y-you must have another slave

483
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,780
等着被你奴役
You've got to... work over,

484
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:25,580
不管你要做什麽都好
whatever it is you do,

485
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,200
我就不耽误你了
So don't... don't let me keep you.

486
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,130
那还只是预告片呢
That was just a... matinee.

487
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,510
再留一会儿   接下来的节目绝对火辣
Stick around. The next one's going to be really hot.

488
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:33,810
喔
Oh...yeah.

489
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,710
其实  我打算回家了
I, uh, actually, I was on my way home...

490
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,760
那麽结束之後  要不要
A-afterwards, how about, uh...

491
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,020
去我家喝杯酒呢  老友重逢一下
coming over to my place for a drink? We can catch up.

492
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,850
现在有点太晚了吧
Actually, it's pretty late... you know.

493
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,340
当「观众」就好
Strictly as "an observer".

494
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,540
开演了
Showtime.

495
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,550
嘿  小帅哥
Hey, little boy,

496
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,500
要不要去我家
You wanna come back to my place?

497
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,860
不
No.

498
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,790
-滚蛋　　　　-你会喜欢的
- Fuck you.  - You'd like that, wouldn't you?

499
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,190
我想你要找老爹吧
I can tell you need a daddy.

500
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,960
我说了  「滚蛋」
I said, "fuck you."

501
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:50,020
你才不是我爹
You're not my daddy.

502
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:54,070
我他妈的才不要什麽狗屁
I don't need a fucking...

503
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:55,940
老爹
Daddy.

504
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,910
我连着3年都当选「皮革先生」
I've been "Mr. Leather" for the past three years.

505
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:13,690
不管是地区的还是和全国的
I've held, uh, both regional and national titles.

506
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,840
真让人印象深刻
I'm, uh... impressed.

507
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,190
也很吓人
And surprised.

508
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,160
有吓到吗
Surprised?

509
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,170
有谁想得到呢
Who would've suspected?

510
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,180
尤其是知道你的「另一面」
Especially considering your "other life".

511
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,240
我西装笔挺  精打细算
The one where I wear a suit, and crunch numbers,

512
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:39,350
对客户阿谀奉承的那一面吗
And treat the clients with undeserved respect?

513
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,550
那不是真正的我
That's not who I really am.

514
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,640
那这个是吗
And this is?

515
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,390
这样很棒  泰德
It's amazing, Ted...

516
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:51,920
令我大开眼界
How it's... allowed me to expand my horizons.

517
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,780
其他方面也是  甚至是在生意上
In other areas too, even in business.

518
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,510
所以说
So, uh...

519
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,630
当皮革老爹是你的致胜关键吗
Being a leather daddy is the key to your success?

520
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,660
一旦你得到许可
Oh, you have no idea what can happen

521
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:05,580
你绝对无法想像会发生什麽事
Once... you give yourself permission.

522
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,470
什麽许可
Permission... uh, w-w-what,

523
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:10,710
捆绑吗
T-t-to chain people up? Tie people down?

524
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,520
那是最能让你解放的部分
That can be the most liberating part of all.

525
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,900
交出对自己的控制权
Relinquishing control,

526
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,860
让别人带给你
Allowing someone else to give you...

527
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,690
痛苦、欢愉
Pain, pleasure.

528
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,860
不管你害怕或渴望什麽
Whatever you most fear and desire.

529
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:33,110
介意我上个洗手间吗
Would you--Would you mind if I use your bathroom?

530
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,530
就在楼下
It's right downstairs.

531
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,570
你找到我的娱乐室了
I see you found my playroom.

532
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:30,030
-对不起  我开错了门　　　　　　　　　　 　-也许没错
- I'm sorry, I just opened the wrong door.    - Or not.

533
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:34,680
-你觉得怎麽样　　　　　　-我...
- So what do you think?     - Uh, well, I...

534
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,190
看来你的装潢设计师玩很大啊
Guess you gave your decorator full rein.

535
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,690
要我示范给你看看吗
Would you like me to give you a little demonstration?

536
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,590
不用了  其实我只是
Oh, that's Okay, actually, I just, uh...

537
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,800
想去洗洗手
I just, uh, wanted to wash my hands.

538
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,300
我们都会乐在其中的
We'd both enjoy it.

539
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:48,030
我一直都觉得你很性感
Always thought you were hot.

540
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:51,550
-真的吗  　　　-乖乖牌其实最狂野
- You did?        - Vanilla boys are always the wildest.

541
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,360
他们的慾望深不可测
All that unfulfilled desire.

542
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,160
我来让你重新认识自己吧
Why don't you allow me to introduce you to yourself?

543
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:07,270
真正的泰德·施密特
To the real Ted Schmidt.

544
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:10,830
我保证不会强迫你做任何事
I promise I won't do anything you don't want me to.

545
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,280
你一说「停」
You say "stop",

546
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,500
我就停
and I'll stop.

547
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,870
停
Stop!

548
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,310
抱...  我没想到会这样
I'm sor... I didn't... I didn't come here for this.

549
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,640
我知道
I know.

550
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,570
你只是个观众
You're just an observer.

551
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:32,250
是的  我想我已经看够了
That's right, and I think I've seen enough.

552
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:35,710
所以  对不起  失陪了
So... if you'll just excuse me.

553
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,190
知道你哪一点让我印象最深刻吗
You know what I remember about you most?

554
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,660
每天在学校餐厅
Every day in the school cafeteria,

555
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:49,810
你总是吃一样的午餐
You'd have the same thing for lunch.

556
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,060
始终如一
So reliable.

557
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,050
我之前一直很好奇  你怎麽从不换口味
I used to marvel how the menu never changed.

558
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,320
我想你也没改变吧
I guess neither have you.

559
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,570
谢谢你招待我的
Thank you for the...

560
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,050
酒
Drink.

561
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:10,510
我不知道
No, I had no idea.

562
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,200
他差一点要喂宝宝烫的牛奶
He was going to give the baby hot milk.

563
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:15,490
-他没先试温度  　　　　　　　　-我不知道
- He didn't test it on his arm.      - I didn't know.

564
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,900
感谢老天我来了  还试了温度
Thank God I walked in when I did.

565
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:17,990
不然盖斯肯定被烫到
Gus could've been scalded.

566
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,590
我很抱歉
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

567
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,420
你他妈的来这干嘛
What the fuck are you doing here?

568
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,970
我提前从迈阿密回来
I came back from Miami early

569
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,830
还收到了琳赛的语音讯息
and there's a message on my voice mail from Lindsay

570
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,680
她说她把盖斯托给你带了
saying that she left Gus here with you.

571
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,220
所以我过来看看他
So I came by to check on him,

572
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,120
看来我还真他妈来对了
and it's a good goddamn thing I did.

573
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,230
把孩子随便扔给别人
Pawning him off on anyone

574
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,320
你就可以去那个皮革派对鬼混了是吧
so you can go to a fucking leather ball?

575
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:36,730
-贾斯汀可不是随便什麽人　　　　-我爱盖斯
- Hey, Justin's not "anyone".         - I love Gus.

576
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,660
亲爱的  我知道你爱盖斯
Baby, I know you do, honey.

577
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,420
我不是责怪你
This isn't about you.

578
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,450
你来抱
You take him.

579
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,050
我是在说你
This is about you

580
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,590
你这个不负责任的混账
And what an irrespon- sible shit you are.

581
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:49,930
听着  我只是出去几个小时而已
Listen, I went out for a couple of hours.

582
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,520
你根本就不应该出去
Yeah, well you shouldn't have been out at all.

583
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,320
因为身为家长之後
Because, you see, the thing about parenthood is,

584
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,330
就不能再随便和野男人一天打两炮
You don't get anonymous-sex breaks twice a day.

585
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,930
车钥匙拿来
Now give me your car keys.

586
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:00,750
-你说什麽  　　　　-车钥匙拿来
- Uh, excuse me?   - I said give me your car keys

587
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,080
我要把安全座椅从你的吉普车搬出来
So I can go get the baby seat out of the back of your jeep.

588
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,840
我要带盖斯回家
I'm taking Gus home.

589
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,860
不行
No, you're not.

590
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,490
这里就是他家
This is his home.

591
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:13,110
至少这个周末
At least for this weekend.

592
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,610
抱歉  你的权利被取消了
Sorry, your privileges have been revoked.

593
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,950
别他妈告诉我什麽狗屁权利
Don't fucking tell me what my privileges are.

594
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,470
我是他的爸爸
I'm his father.

595
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,180
你又是哪位？
Who are you?

596
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,890
我也许谁都不是
I may be no one,

597
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,520
但我至少够爱他
But at least I love him enough

598
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:37,200
我会他的需求摆在我之前
to know that his needs come before mine.

599
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,150
这一点  你可永远做不到
which is more than can be said for you.

600
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,620
快来吧
Yeah, go, go, go, go, go, go!

601
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,640
汉克
Hank!

602
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,710
太棒了
Yes!

603
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,650
爸爸  看我看我
Daddy, look at me. Look at me.

604
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:52,970
小心  宝贝
Careful, honey.

605
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:54,580
太棒了
Yes!

606
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,880
汉克在去年的冠军赛上打进了致胜一球
Hank scored the winning goal in the champion- ship last year.

607
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,720
他真厉害
Of course he did.

608
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,150
你怎麽一个人坐在边线上
How come you're sitting on the sidelines?

609
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,020
我说了我不会滑冰
I told you, I can't skate.

610
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,750
我来教你
Well, I'll help you.

611
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,820
如果上帝真要我滑冰
If God wanted me to be on ice

612
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,680
祂应该先给我调杯伏特加马丁尼酒
He'd have made me a vodka martini.

613
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,360
让我现在喝
which I could use right about now.

614
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,080
这算什麽  「同志溜冰」吗
What is this, "fags on ice"?

615
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,750
这是奥运花式溜冰队
That's the Olympic figure-skating team.

616
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:24,870
好吧
Okay.

617
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,520
我的电话响了
Ah, that's me.

618
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,200
汉克  帮我扶着迈克
Hank, will you help me with Michael, please?

619
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,030
我是卡麦伦医生
Dr. Cameron.

620
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,440
是的
Yes.

621
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,030
开什麽玩笑
Oh, you're kidding!

622
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,150
我半个小时就能到
Yeah, I could be there in about half an hour.

623
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,360
好的
Okay.

624
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,220
一个冰球队员在训练时摔伤後背了
One of the penguins threw his back out during practice.

625
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,850
抱歉  冠军  我要先走
I'm sorry, champ, I've got to go.

626
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,960
不会很久
I won't be very long.

627
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:50,130
没关系
No biggie.

628
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,290
对我来说大有关系
Well, it's a biggie to me.

629
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,550
你就这麽让我一个人和他一起吗
You're leaving me alone with him?

630
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,220
我不会去很久
Well, I'm not going to be very long.

631
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,790
我们彼此还不大认识
We don't know each other very well.

632
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,360
你现在有机会了
Well, you'll get to.

633
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:03,520
但是  大卫  你不懂
But...David, you don't understand.

634
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,540
我不懂什麽？   迈克
I don't under- stand what, Michael?

635
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,830
他只想和你在一起
Well, he was looking forward to being with you.

636
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,700
我不会去很久
I'm not going to be gone for very long.

637
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,740
听着
Look.

638
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:16,890
这个是今天的行程  照着这个走
Here's the itinerary. You stick to that,

639
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,570
你们会玩得很开心
You'll have a great time. Okay?

640
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,950
我们一会儿再见
I'll see you in a little while.

641
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,230
-亲爱的　　　　-黛比
- Hi, honey.        - Hello, Deb.

642
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,130
亲爱的
Hi, baby.

643
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,000
昨晚怎麽样  「孩子他爹」
Hey! How'd it go last night, "Daddy"?

644
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,720
别在我面前提到这个词好吗
Huh. Would you mind not using that word in my presence?

645
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,540
呒…开始抱怨了
Ooh, grouchy, huh?

646
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:44,170
照顾小孩难免会这样
That's what happens when you tend to a tot, see?

647
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,740
这差事可不轻松
It's not a pretty job.

648
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,420
但我还是以你为荣  布莱恩
But I'm proud of you, Brian.

649
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:49,930
居然愿意牺牲皮革派对不去
Huh? Sacrificing the leather ball.

650
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,070
那牺牲可够大
Whoo! That's big.

651
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,480
「牺牲」是他的小名
Altruism's his middle name.

652
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,640
原来此「牺」非彼「吸」啊
Oh, is that what the "A" stands for?

653
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,440
我从没想过
I didn't think in a million years

654
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,080
你愿意为了小孩而放弃那个派对
You'd give up an event like that.

655
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,830
所以我准备脱帽
So I tip my hat...

656
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,360
还是说脱下假发
or should I say, my wig?

657
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:04,800
向尽责带孩子的你
To you, kid. Huh?

658
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,450
表示敬意
For taking care of your kid.

659
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:09,290
实际上  我才是...
Actually, I'm the one that...

660
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,180
你要是说出来  我就把你的蛋蛋捆起来
Give me up and I'll tie your balls so tight

661
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,820
让他们疼上一个星期
they'll ache for a week.

662
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,320
这算是惩罚吗？
This is punishment?

663
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,050
我帮忙了
I helped.

664
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,050
是吗
Did you, honey?

665
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,280
很好啊  宝贝
Good, baby.

666
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,620
说到宝贝  我就很想要点...
Well, all this talk about babies, Has given me a craving

667
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,360
一份烤小肋排
For the baby- back ribs.

668
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:28,150
好
Got 'em.

669
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:33,400
-我要  　　　　　　-面包夹金枪鱼
- I'll have, uh,          - The tuna fish...On white bread.

670
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,020
双份蛋黄酱
Double mayo.

671
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:37,740
薯片和高丽菜沙拉
Potato chips, and coleslaw.

672
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,410
还有香草布丁
And vanilla pudding.

673
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,490
上帝啊  我就这麽好猜吗
Christ, am I really that predictable?

674
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:46,170
没有  你只是始终如一
No, honey, just reliable.

675
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:47,750
谢谢了
Thanks ever so.

676
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,680
你的风格就不是爱变来变去的
I-it's just not your style to be spontaneous,

677
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:52,890
狂野
Wild...

678
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,800
无所顾忌
Reckless.

679
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,990
不　我的风格是从不冒险
No, it's my style to never take a chance,

680
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,340
从不放松
Never let myself go,

681
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,850
从不躺上吊床
Never put my ass in a sling.

682
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,990
我是说…从不冒险
I mean, on the line.

683
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,160
亲爱的  不过是一顿午饭
Honey, it's only lunch.

684
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:07,160
这样的话  我要香辣鲶鱼
Yeah, well in that case, I will have the cajun catfish

685
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:10,650
泰式炒面

686
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,420
和木瓜芒果莎莎酱
Uh, papaya-mango salsa on the side.

687
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:16,130
勇於改变不一定要搞到拉肚子
Letting go does not mean getting the runs.

688
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,130
给他平常会点的那些吧
Give him the usual.

689
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,030
不管你吃什麽
It doesn't matter what you eat.

690
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,730
你一直会是老..
You'll always be old...

691
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,700
老实可靠的泰德
Old, reliable Ted.

692
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,430
真是令人惊讶
You know it's... i-it's amazing

693
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,090
你在这里住了一辈子
How you can live in a city your whole life

694
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,140
却不知道原来这里有这麽多观光景点
and not realize how many wonderful sights

695
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,760
和旅游胜地
and attractions there are, you know?

696
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:38,500
比如说  谁知道呢
For instance, who knew that there was a thing

697
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:39,530
在卡内基科学中心
Called the "scream machine"?

698
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:42,490
竟会有个尖叫机
At the Carnegie Science Centre, you know?

699
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:45,380
体验重力加速度的感受
Experiencing the g-forces was cer-tainly a, uh,

700
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,700
对我来说  就是「恶心想吐　束手无措」
"stomach churning, nail-biting

701
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,860
的科学教育
science edu- cation" for me.

702
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,560
最让人难忘的是
What made it especially memorable

703
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:55,770
我们刚刚吃的大号义式辣香肠比萨
was the large pepperoni pizza we shared moments before.

704
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:57,600
我们能回家了吗
Can we go home now?

705
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,880
那我们不去...
What, and miss the, uh...

706
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,460
蒙诺加海拉缆车了吗
Monongahela incline?

707
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,970
听着
Look...

708
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,230
我知道对你来说这不容易
I know this isn't easy for you.

709
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,630
有个这样的爸爸
You know, having a dad who's, well...

710
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,280
和其他人的爸爸不一样
Different from other fathers.

711
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,970
而看着他和我在一起
And I'm sure it doesn't make it any easier

712
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,300
我想你也不好受
seeing him with me.

713
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,480
他是同志  没什麽大不了
So he's gay. Big deal!

714
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:25,050
我九岁就知道了
I've only known about it like since I was, like, nine.

715
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:28,810
等一下
Wait.

716
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,870
那你为什麽不愿意来这儿
So why don't you want to be here?

717
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,540
因为我快被他烦死了
'cause he drives me nuts.

718
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:33,590
每次我一来
Every time I come here,

719
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,610
他就把每分钟都安排好了
He's got to have every single minute planned.

720
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:38,020
坐缆车  去博物馆  看水族馆
The incline, the museum, the aquarium.

721
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,910
我小时候可能觉得好玩
I mean, that may have been fun when I was a kid,

722
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,840
但是那些鱼要重覆看几遍？
But... how many times can you see fish?

723
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:45,140
那你怎麽不告诉他呢
So why don't you tell him to back off?

724
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:47,890
你试过说服他吗？
Have you ever tried telling him to back off?

725
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:50,030
说得好  但你要知道
Good point. But you know,

726
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,780
他只是想让你在这里玩得开心
He just wants you to have a good time.

727
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:57,140
我的天啊  快看
Oh, my god. Check it out.

728
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,520
《天蠍人》  第34期
Scorpionhead number 34.

729
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:02,480
天啊  我找一辈子了
Holy shit! I've been looking for that my entire life.

730
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:05,530
-你也是吗  　-在拍卖网上都买不到
- You too?   - Y-you can't even find that on e-bay.

731
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,930
天蠍人太酷了
U-uh... scorpionhead is so cool.

732
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,120
酷毙了  他还能
So cool! the way he can...

733
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:11,420
用鼻子扎人
sting with his nose!

734
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:12,690
-没错  　　　-你想进去看看吗
- Exactly!      - You want to check it out?

735
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,620
废话  当然了
Fuck yeah!

736
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:48,090
你妈妈在厨房
Hey. Your mom's in the kitchen.

737
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,470
自己去倒杯咖啡吧
Get yourself a cup of coffee,

738
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,960
顺便给我再倒一杯  好吗
and get me a refill, would you?

739
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,190
其实我不是来看她的
I'm not here to see her, actually.

740
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,700
你不是应该多休息吗
Shouldn't you be taking it easy?

741
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,820
我休息的时间多着呢
I'll have plenty of time to take it easy...

742
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,990
多年来的东西都堆在这里
There's years of stuff out here, I...

743
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,680
我想我得整理一下
I need to... I want to... get every- thing in order.

744
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:13,100
就等着给你看这个呢  宝贝儿子
Oh, wait till you see this, sonny-boy.

745
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:20,110
你以前的保龄球队叫什麽来着
What was that team you used to bowl with?

746
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,930
东方国王
Eastway kings.

747
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:25,320
你以前常跟我一起去  八九岁的时候
You used to come with me when you were, what, eight, nine?

748
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:26,190
你还记得吗
You remember that?

749
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,040
当然了
Yeah.

750
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,460
我一直希望你能跟着玩呢
I always hoped you'd take it up.

751
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,580
听着  那天晚上
Listen, about the other night.

752
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:38,800
我知道  我去之前应该先打个电话
I know. I should've called before I dropped in.

753
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,830
就像《瓦尔顿湖》里说的
Like "The Warden" says,

754
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:43,480
「电话就是这时候用的」
"that's what they make telephones for."

755
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,200
我来吧
I got it.

756
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,480
见鬼
Shit.

757
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:52,590
我们得谈谈
We need to talk.

758
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:54,630
这可是我第一次听你开口说
You know, I think that's the first time

759
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,080
「我们得谈谈」
I ever heard you say that?

760
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:59,030
是啊  可能以前我不需要开这个口
Yeah. That's probably 'cause that's the first time I ever have.

761
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:02,190
我想或许我们可以
I just thought that maybe we could, uh...

762
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,010
赶在最後期限之前谈谈
Sneak it under the wire, huh?

763
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,760
这还有几本书
Hey, I got some books here.

764
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:08,950
我是同志
I'm gay.

765
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:26,020
你可他妈的真会挑时机
Well, you picked a hell of a fucking time

766
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,650
告诉我你是小屁精
to tell me you're a fairy.

767
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,730
好像我还忍受得还不够多
As if I don't have enough to deal with.

768
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:36,260
老天啊
Geez.

769
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:42,640
你才是那个该去死的人   不是我
You're the one that should be dying, instead of me.

770
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:53,570
可现在要死的人不是我   你他妈的自私老头
But I'm not dying, you selfish old prick.

771
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:57,970
是你
You are.

772
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:12,090
-哇  看啊  　　　　　　　-太棒了
- Aw, look at this guy.     - That's great.

773
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,640
-我回来啦  　　-噢天哪
- Hey, guys.      - Oh, my gosh.

774
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:14,870
让你们久等了
Sorry it took so long.

775
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,750
-我没想到这麽久  　　　　　-爸
- Longer than I expected.   - Dad!

776
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,500
-什麽    　-你一定不相信我们找到什麽
- What?  - You can't believe What Michael and I found.

777
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,480
《天蠍人》  第34期
Scorpionhead No.34!

778
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:21,540
真是不错  汉克
That's... that's great, Hank.

779
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,660
你欠我一百五十元
You owe me 150 bucks.

780
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,600
我要去告诉亚当
Oh, I'm gonna go page Adam.

781
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:27,390
-他也迷天蠍人　　　　　　　　　　　-等等  等等
- He's a Scorpionhead head, too.       - Wait, wait, wait.

782
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,290
-等等  告诉我  　　　　　　　　　-待会再说
- Wait a second. Tell me about   - Hold on, hold on. Hold on.

783
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,790
今天玩得怎麽样啊
tell me about your day.

784
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,350
-我俩玩疯了  　　　-太好了
- We had a blast.  - Great.

785
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,050
看来你俩颇有进展嘛
Ah, looks like it went off in here.

786
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:38,640
你怎麽样
And what about you?

787
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,670
有看见脱光光的冰球队员吗
Did you see any, uh, naked penguins?

788
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,600
就一个
Yeah, just the one.

789
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,070
缆车好玩吗
So tell me about the incline.

790
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,380
呃  其实
Oh, well we, uh...

791
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:46,550
我们稍稍改变了一下行程
We took a detour from the official itinerary

792
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,300
去了漫画天堂
and we went to Comixland.

793
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,430
那我规划的景点呢
What about all the things I had planned?

794
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,330
你们就呆在这看了一天漫画吗
You sat around here all day and read comics?

795
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,940
汉克喜欢这样啊
It was what Hank wanted.

796
00:38:58,050 --> 00:38:59,840
你别误会
Don't take this the wrong way,

797
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:04,520
他对你安排的行程不怎麽感兴趣
But, he's not too crazy about the schedule.

798
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:05,510
他不懂为什麽
He doesn't understand why

799
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,270
你非得整天带着他东跑西跑
You have to drag him around every minute.

800
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,270
这怎麽叫东跑西跑呢
Who's dragging him around?

801
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,660
我只是希望让他开心
I just want him to have a good time.

802
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:12,310
或许他的开心  和你想的不一样
Well, maybe his idea of a good time is different than yours

803
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,270
而你也没考虑过他的想法
And you didn't bother to find out what it was.

804
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,470
你不用教我怎麽带孩子
Hey, don't tell me how to raise my son.

805
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,930
我没有  我
I'm not! I just...

806
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,930
我只想帮忙
I-I'm trying to help.

807
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,330
你这下倒是变专家了是吗
Yeah, but all of a sudden you're a fucking authority?

808
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,240
他来这里不开心
He's unhappy here.

809
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,900
他想回家
He wants to go home.

810
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:26,410
我本来以为是因为我
And not because of the reasons that I thought,

811
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,710
但其实  是因为你
But because of... because of you.

812
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,690
问题在你
You're the problem.

813
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:14,500
这里好玩的很多
There are many pleasures to be found here.

814
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,830
你连想都想不到
Places that you're afraid to even think of going.

815
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:23,360
我可以带你体验
I can take you there.

816
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,240
但首先  你要服从我
But first you must surrender to me.

817
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,030
百分之百
Completely.

818
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,240
你会服从吗
Do you surrender?

819
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,760
是  我会服从
Yes, I-I surrender.

820
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:38,780
「长官」
"Sir".

821
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,740
叫我「长官」
You will call me "sir".

822
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,300
是  长官
Sir.

823
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,230
你就是我的「奴隶」
And you are "slave".

824
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,950
这里有点  有点冷
It's... it's kind of cold in here.

825
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,510
我没准你说话
I didn't say you could speak.

826
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:09,250
-抱歉  　　　　-「长官」
- I'm sorry.        - "Sir".

827
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,160
抱歉  长官
I'm sorry , sir.

828
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,580
真听话
Good slave.

829
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,840
我怎麽说  你就怎麽做
Now you will do exactly as you are told.

830
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,650
等夏天到了
So I thought this summer,

831
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,350
我们可以去泛舟
We could go white water rafting.

832
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,870
我要去棒球营
I'm going to baseball camp this summer.

833
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,830
噢  也好
Oh. Well, th-that's good.

834
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,780
那感恩节去远足怎麽样
Well, Thanksgiving we could go hiking. Hiking...

835
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:00,780
我们要去外婆家
We're going to Grandma and Grandpa's.

836
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,730
行  那就耶诞了
Okay, that takes us to Christmas.

837
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:03,660
耶诞节去滑雪吧
Christmas we can go skiing.

838
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,370
你怎麽还不明白呢
You just don't get it, do you?

839
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:19,710
迈克说  你不怎麽开心
Michael told me you weren't having a very good time.

840
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,430
我之前还不相信
And I didn't want to believe him.

841
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,650
我想尽办法  就想让你
You know, I was just trying really hard to...

842
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,010
没错  爸爸
That's just it, Dad.

843
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:30,710
你就是想太多了
You just try too hard.

844
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,970
大概是吧
Yeah, I guess I do.

845
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,740
可能是因为我们很少见面
I suppose that's because I don't get to see you very often.

846
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:37,820
你住那边  而我在这
You live out there, and I'm back here.

847
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:40,830
每次能和你待个几天
So for those few days that I'm lucky enough to have you,

848
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,490
我就想弄得特别点
I just want it to be something special.

849
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,390
好歹做点什麽
Some... something.

850
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:47,560
能让你记住我
So you remember me.

851
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,510
让你别忘了我
So you won't forget me.

852
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:53,330
和你在一起时  是我甩开老妈和盖瑞
When I'm with you, I'm getting away from Mom and Gary

853
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:56,700
还有学校的那些狗屁压力
And all that bullshit stress happens at school.

854
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,280
我只想放轻松
And, I mean, I just want to hang out.

855
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,000
不用老是想着
Not have to worry about doing something

856
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:04,460
每分每秒要干什麽
every single minute of my day.

857
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:10,440
就好比躺着看漫画吗
You mean just like lying around, reading comics?

858
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,520
对啊
Yeah.

859
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:15,600
当我想的时候
I mean, if I feel like it.

860
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:18,780
美航飞往波特兰的1815次班机
American Airlines flight 1815 to Portland

861
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:20,590
现在开始登机
Is now ready for boarding.

862
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:22,610
美航
American Airlines...

863
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:23,850
你该走了
That's you.

864
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,490
晚上打给我
Call me tonight.

865
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:28,370
不管多晚
No matter how late it is.

866
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,730
好的
Okay, I will.

867
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:33,660
再见  汉克
Bye, Hank.

868
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,470
下一位
Next.

869
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,440
谢谢你送的天蠍人
Thanks for the scorpionhead.

870
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,130
再见
Bye-bye.

871
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:50,970
下一位请上前来
Next person in line, please.

872
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,170
其实我不介意当後母
You know, I actually don't mind being a stepmother.

873
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:00,680
你没有爸爸
For someone who had never had a father,

874
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:02,570
可是爸爸经倒懂得不少
you sure know a lot about being one.

875
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:04,720
我是假想
Well, I just...

876
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:08,710
要真有个爸爸  我希望他怎麽做
Imagined what I'd want him to act like, if I did.

877
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:14,210
那我们又回到二人世界啦
So, we've got the house all to ourself again.

878
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:15,710
想做什麽
What do you feel like doing?

879
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:19,180
不知道啊  洗洗衣服  记记帐
I don't know, laundry? Bookkeeping?

880
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,740
接着再猜啊   老兄
Try again, stud.

881
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:26,260
你都向我保证了
I mean, you gave me your word.

882
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:28,190
你保证我能放心把他托给你的
You swore I could trust you with him.

883
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:32,100
你前女友已经痛骂过我了
Look, your ex already reamed me out.

884
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:33,760
那现在该我了
Well, now it's my turn.

885
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:35,490
你说会好好当父亲
You said you wanted to be his parent.

886
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,200
那就要好好当
If that's true, then fucking well be one.

887
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:39,790
别他妈光说不练
But don't tell me you'll be there for him when you're not.

888
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,970
你只爱自己  从没关心过别人
When you've never been there for anyone else other than yourself.

889
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:44,230
嘿  宝贝儿子
Hey, sunny-boy.

890
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:45,690
有人吗
Anyone home?

891
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:50,880
你来干什麽
What are you doing here?

892
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:52,140
一会就走
I'll only be a minute.

893
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:56,740
我整里那些箱子的时候  找到了这个
I found something when I was going through those boxes.

894
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:58,200
你应该会想要
I thought you might want it.

895
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:02,870
我和你的合照  那时你才四个月大
That's me and you when you were four months old.

896
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:05,680
你傻笑什麽？
Why are you smiling?

897
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:08,620
照相嘛  总得笑一下
It's a photograph. Isn't that what you're supposed to do?

898
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:09,590
我不要
I don't want it.

899
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,140
等我死了  你可别後悔
You might change your mind one day, when I'm gone.

900
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:16,900
多半不会
I doubt it.

901
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:22,690
你知道   当一个同志你还满会出拳的
You know, you can really pack a wallop for a fag.

902
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,760
别告诉你妈妈  知道吗
Just don't tell your mother, you understand?

903
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,550
别搞到她照三餐祷告
She'll be at fucking mass three times a day praying...

904
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:33,150
肯尼先生
Mr. Kinney.

905
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:38,450
你可能不记得我了  我是琳赛
You probably don't remember me. But... i'm Lindsay.

906

Petersen.

907
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,300
我当然记得你
Course I remember you.

908
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:45,670
这麽多年了
Although it's been a long time.

909
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:47,590
你还那麽标致啊
You're still a looker.

910
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,900
谢谢  肯尼先生
Thank you, Mr. Kinney.

911
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:49,950
叫我杰克就好
Jack.

912
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,930
你以为你还是万人迷吗？
What, do you still think you're a ladies' man?

913
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:58,800
儿子长得真好
You have yourself a beautiful son.

914
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:04,400
我差不多该走了
Well, I guess I'll be on my way.

915
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:09,020
还有个人  想让你见见
There's someone else I want you to say hello to.

916
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,020
这是你孙子
Your grandson.

917
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:19,200
我孙子？
My grandson?

918
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:25,550
这到底怎麽回事
What the fuck's going on?

919
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:28,720
你跟我开玩笑吗  宝贝儿子？
Are you screwing with me, sunny-boy?

920
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:30,470
没开玩笑
No, I'm not screwing with you.

921
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:36,050
杰克  想抱抱他吗
Jack, would you like to hold him?

922
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,730
噢  我
Oh, I...

923
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:42,430
我好久没抱过小孩了  不过
It's been a while, you know, since I held a baby, but...

924
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:45,210
好啊
Yeah.

925
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:53,480
你好
Hi.

926
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:05,030
