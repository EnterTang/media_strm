同志亦凡人 Queer As Folk S01E13

4
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,320
太保守了
Too conservative.

5
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:43,800
布莱恩

舒尔曼鞋的设计

你绝对会爱死它的
You're going to love it.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,860
爱不爱由我说了算
I'll be the judge of that.

12
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:55,800
打扰一下
Sorry.

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,960
你来找人的吗
You looking for someone?

14
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,890
是啊  舒尔曼鞋的会议
Yeah. The Schulmann shoe meeting.

15
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,040
莱德先生说我应该出席的
Mr. Ryder said I should sit in,

16
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,650
过来学点东西
Learn a thing or two, he said.

17
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,050
布莱恩可是最棒的
Well, Brian is the best.

18
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:06,970
最棒的
The best.

19
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:07,930
谢了  布莱德
Thanks, Brad.

20
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:09,320
恩...我是鲍勃
Uh, I-I'm Bob.

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,170
我才是布莱德
I'm Brad.

22
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,900
我是基普·汤玛斯
I'm Kip Thomas.

23
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,470
我还是个新人
I just started here.

24
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,430
那好  坐下吧  基普·汤玛斯
Well, sit your ass down, Kip Thomas.

25
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,000
这两位同事正准备露一手
The boys are about to put on a show.

26
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:18,490
那麽...
So...

27
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,790
这麽丑的鞋  我们要怎麽让它变成有市场呢
How do we make this fucking ugly shoe exciting?

28
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,060
跟去年五月的那件
The same way we made those fucking ugly raincoats

29
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,230
-丑雨衣一样　　　　　-模特儿
-Exciting last May.  -Models.

30
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:29,300
把目光从鞋子本身
By taking your eye off this shoe...

31
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,280
转移到模特儿脸上
And putting it on this face.

32
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,850
是啊  问题是我们要卖的不是这张脸
Yeah, but t-the trouble is that we're not selling this face.

33
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,520
我们卖的是这双恶心巴拉的鞋
We're selling this hideous shoe.

34
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,530
你觉得呢？
What do you think?

35
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,550
我蛮喜欢的  这...
Uh, I like it. It's, um...

36
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:52,990
这方案挺不错的
It's really good.

37
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:55,470
不过...
Only...

38
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,370
-不过？  -不过？
-Only?　 -Only?

39
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,410
为什麽要把商品藏起来呢
Well, why try and hide what the product is?

40
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:03,910
接着说
Go on.

41
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,960
我会拍一张鞋的照片
I'd just photograph the shoe.

42
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,600
恩...放一个旁白框在旁边
With maybe a... a thought bubble

43
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,340
说着  像是...
Saying some- thing like, uh...

44
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,800
「吾非时尚」
"I'm not hip...

45
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,350
我乃经典！」
I'm a classic."

46
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,060
布莱恩  请问我们能继续了吗
Brian, may we continue, please?

47
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,790
不  你们不用继续了
No, you may not.

48
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,400
「吾非时尚  我乃经典！」
"I'm not hip, I'm a classic."

49
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,710
你赋予它一种个性
You've given it personality,

50
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:32,360
带着幽默  还包含了一种高贵质感
With humour, and retained its so- called dignity.

51
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:34,990
你来这儿多久了
How long have you been here?

52
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,960
2个月
Uh, two months.

53
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,930
知道吗  他们在这里工作两年了
You know, they've been working here for two years.

54
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,210
去起草方案吧
Draw it up.

55
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,040
我?
Me?

56
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,290
-他?   -他?
-Him?  -Him?

57
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,360
恩
Him.

58
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,400
他们俩会帮你的
The boys'll help you out.

59
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,370
是不是啊  孩子们
Won't you, boys?

60
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,210
知道吗  我得说在一年之前
You know, I just have to say that a year ago

61
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,750
我们从没想过  我们会有
I don't think any of us would have dreamed that we'd be...

62
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,010
怀孕的一天  我是说
Sitting here pregnant. I mean, it's...

63
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,580
真难以置信
Really happened.

64
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,490
感谢那两个勇敢的开创先锋
Thanks to two true trail-blazing pioneers,

65
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,730
茉蕾妮和琳赛
Melanie and Lindsay.

66
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,680
你们现在可是榜样了
Now you're role models.

67
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,750
我们所有人的榜样  谢谢你们
For us all. thank you.

68
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,160
真希望她们赶紧走人
I wish they'd all leave.

69
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,090
嘘  别让他们听见啦
Shh, you don't want them to hear you.

70
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,420
听见就听见阿  我们干嘛要忍受这些啊
I don't care if they do. Why did we go through with this?

71
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,960
我们都计划了好几个月了
We planned it for months.

72
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,590
我们不能让弗兰妮和佐伊失望
We couldn't disappoint Franny and Zoe,

73
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,630
不然她们会怎麽想
How would they feel?

74
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,040
那你觉得我会怎麽想
How do you think I feel?

75
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,790
我自己就像个愚蠢的大骗子
Like a liar and a fool.

76
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,020
我们能不能晚点再谈这个
Can we talk about this later?

77
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,580
当然了亲爱的  像其他事儿一样拖着
Sure, honey, like every- thing else.

78
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,020
我要来去喝点酒了
I'm going to go spike the punch.

79
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,740
太可爱了
Oh, it's so cute.

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,560
弗兰妮真是小巧又可爱
Franny's so cute and tiny.

81
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,720
老天  我讨厌这种人
Christ, I hate cute and tiny.

82
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,080
老天啊
Oh, god.

83
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,700
你应该是她最好的朋友
You're probably her best friend.

84
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,200
从高中起就是了
Since high school.

85
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:57,770
哦 干
Oh, fuck.

86
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,000
十分赞同你的意见
I'll drink to that.

87
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,640
别担心
Don't worry anyways,

88
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,080
我也讨厌小巧又可爱的那些鬼话
I hate cute and tiny, too.

89
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,750
婴儿皮外套!!
Baby leather jacket, ah!

90
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,670
实在太可爱了
That is so adorable!

91
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,840
老天啊  我现在
Oh, Christ, I would just kill

92
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,320
真想去抽支烟
For a cigarette right about now.

93
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,260
这些宝宝之类的事情快把我逼疯了
All this baby business is just making me a little crazy.

94
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,100
为什麽 是因为你想要个孩子吗
Why, because you want one?

95
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,100
是不想要个孩子
Because I don't want one.

96
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,430
别误会  我挺喜欢小孩子的
Don't get me wrong, I like kids.

97
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,530
只不过是别人家的孩子
Other people's kids.

98
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,880
估计也就喜欢10分钟吧
For about 10 minutes.

99
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,410
我算是个工作狂的Ｔ婆
I'm more of a career dyke myself.

100
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,600
我过去也常常这麽说
I used to say the same thing.

101
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,820
直到我们有了自己的儿子
That was until we had our son.

102
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,010
我是茉蕾妮·马库斯
I'm Melanie Marcus.

103
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,010
是  我知道  「榜样」嘛

104
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,010
我是玛丽安·麦克唐纳
I'm Marianne Macdonald.

105
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,070
绝对不是个榜样
Definitely not a role model.

106
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,200
那真不错
Well, good for you.

107
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:52,790
不过  我想你可以叫我"PC"
Though, I suppose you could say I am "pc".

108
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,710
前提是  "PC"的意思是
That is, if "pc" stands for...

109
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,760
舔阴唇的女人
"Performs Cunnilingus".

110
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,630
老天  你真是个怪人
Oh, god, you're wicked.

111
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:03,900
谢谢
Thank you.

112
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,030

I'll make the reservations, as usual.

116
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:26,890
三个位子
For the three of us.

117
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,100
三个人？
Three of us?

00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,280
是啊  我  艾美特  还有泰德

Oh, we need someone older to chaperone.

120

真是太有才了  我崇拜你的机智反应啊
What sparkling wit. I live for your repartee.

121
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,650

And what about me?

122
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,260
-你可不能去 　　 -为什麽
-You can't go. 　-Why not?

123
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,870
你可是交往中
You're in a relationship.

124
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,230
还是说你忘了自已有家室？
Or have you forgotten?

125
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,920
风花雪月与你无缘喽
No more fun for yo-ou.

126
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,850
大卫说我可以去
Oh. David said I could go,

127
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,530
只是我要乖乖的而已
As long as I behave myself.

128
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,510
那还去干嘛？
Well then, what's the point of going?

129
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,400
表示我和小艾多一点机会了
Just means more men for me and Em.

130
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,430
是不是  小艾
Right, Em?

131
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,440

你是怎麽了?
What's the matter with you?

134
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,010
刮毛不小心…　蛋疼吧
He's got razor-burn on his balls.

You're coming? Or do we have to carry you?

139
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,040
我想先喝完这瓶再说

他们要去p-town的狂欢派对
They're making plans to go to p-town.

143
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,370
我  我想去
And I-I... want to go.

144
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,780
那些男人
Uh, all those men...

145
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,710
还有嗨药
All those drugs.

146
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,100
抱歉
Sorry.

147
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,420
这还不是最糟的
And that's not the worst of it.

148
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,780
今天我差点卖了我祖父临终之前
Today I almost sold the watch my grandfather gave me

149
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,380
留给我的手表
on his deathbed...

150
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,070
就为了买
to buy a ticket for...

151
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,440
芭芭拉那场所谓的
Barbra's absolutely

152
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,250
「最终告别　我发誓－这真的是最後」
Final farewell, I-swear-to-god-

153
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,390
「告别演唱会的门票」
This-is-it concert. I mean,

154
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,410
这周的薪水几乎都养不活我自己了
I can barely survive on my week's salary

155
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,980
我还去帮着填饱布连小姐的荷包？
and I-I'm going to help fill Mrs. Brolin's coffer?

156
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:08,990
悲剧
Sick.

157
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,170
我生病了
I'm sick.

158
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,670
但你还有救
But there's a cure.

159
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,480
所以你才会去了"看见希望"的聚会
That's why you came to "See The Light".

160
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,220
相信我  我理解你的感受
Believe me, I know how you feel.

161
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,280
我是过来人
I've been there.

162
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,840
你看
Look at this.

163
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,530
这是谁
What do you see?

164
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:24,890
某个变装皇后
A picture of a drag queen.

165
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,190
要不就是你妈妈
Or your mother.

166
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,010
这是我
That was me.

167
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,570
不会吧
No-o-o! Come on!

168
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,860
但你现在这麽...
But you're so...

169
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,820
直男外表?  谢谢
Straight? Thank you.

170
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,230
我保留这张照片  把它当作过去生活的回忆
I keep this photo as a reminder of my former life.

171
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,050
但即使这样  我也知道在这些假发
But even then, I knew under all those wigs

172
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,940
和美丽的长裙下
and those fabulous gowns,

173
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,520
隐藏着一个渴望自由的
there was a conservative,

174
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,980
保守共和党电脑分析师
republican computer analyst dying to be free.

175
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,060
这就是"看见光明"对我的帮助
That's what "See The Light" did for me.

176
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,070
你也会得到同样的帮助
And it can do the same for you,

177
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,190
-如果你是认真想改的话  　-我是
-If you're serious.      -I am.

178
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,340
我是认真的  我发誓
I am serious. I swear to god.

179
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,270
很好  但别自欺欺人
Good. But don't fool yourself.

180
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,460
这过程不会简单
It won't be easy.

181
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:02,980
有时你可能必须
At some point you may even have to

182
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,980
让自己远离
extricate yourself from...

183
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,650
某些让人堕落的影响
certain corrupt influences.

184
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,880
你是说我的朋友们吗
You mean my friends?

185
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,310
如果他们让你堕落
Are they really your friends

186
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,960
那还叫朋友吗
If they lead you into temptation?

187
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,230
他们绝不是故意的
Well, they never do it deliberately.

188
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,810
艾美特  如果你要走向光明
Emmett, if you see the light

189
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,380
不能让任何人或事
You mustn't allow anything or anyone

190
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,810
使你越走越偏离正轨
to divert you from the path.

191
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,500
谢谢你对我的支持  马特
Thank you, Matt, for your support.

192
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,850
这是我的职责所在
Hey, that's why I'm here,

193
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,150
确保你不会走歪路
To make sure you don't slip.

194
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,500
布莱恩
Brian.

195
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,490
你已经当了执行长吗
You CEO of the company yet?

196
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,600
那得再给我几周时间
Ah, give me a week or two.

197
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,340
莱德先生告诉我
So, Mr. Ryder told me

198
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,600
你真的把我的创意用在鞋子广告里
You're really going to use my ideas for the shoe ads.

199
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,540
我会窃其精华  再改成我的名字
I'll steal anything good and put my name on it.

200
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:56,670
很好
That's great.

201
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,610
但鲍勃和布莱德不太高兴
Although Bob and Brad aren't too happy about it.

202
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,520
没才华的人才会不高兴
Well, people with no talent usually aren't

203
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,130
特别是看到有真才实学的人出现
when someone with real talent comes along.

204
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,340
我听说你自己就才华出众
Yeah, I hear you're pretty talented yourself.

205
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,700
事实上 其实你还声名在外
In fact, you have a reputation.

206
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:11,710
是吗
I do?

207
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,480
替公司拉拢不少大客户
For being the best account exec in the company.

208
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,740
是的  包括这一点
Yeah. That too.

209
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,280
这也是我拜托高层让我跟你工作的原因
And that's why I asked if I could work with you.

210
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,250
我以为是莱德叫你过来的
I thought Ryder assigned you.

211
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,080
我...
Yeah. I, uh...

212
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:27,950
骗你的
lied.

213
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,520
过来  给你看样东西
Come here for a second, I want to show you something.

214
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,410
这是我们为"自由空气"公司做的竞标广告
This is a new campaign we're starting for Liberty Air.

215
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,910
你就去这个团队吧
I want you on the team.

216
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:43,020
天啊  太好了
Oh, my god. That's... th-that's... fantastic!

217
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,680
我真不知道该如何感谢你
How can I ever thank you?

218
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,380
做好工作就行了
By doing a good job.

219
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,820
你尽管放心
You can count on it.

220
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,600
我还想告诉你…
I just want you to know that you can...

221
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,550
我随时听候你差遣
You can count on me for anything.

222
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,590
不论是白天还是晚上..
Day or night.

223
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,910
你真的是要飞黄腾达了
Well, you really are going for the gold watch.

224
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:21,250
我说真的
I mean it.

225
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:28,850
因为我觉得你真的...
Because I think you're really...

226
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,860
很性感
really amazing.

227
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,620
你这是做什麽
What are you doing?

228
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,250
妈的
Shit.

229
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,010
抱歉　嗯..
I'm sorry, um...

230
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,670
我不是故意..
I didn't mean to, uh...

231
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,940
我不知道刚才在想什麽
Look, I don't know what I was thinking.

232
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,730
无论如何你在想什麽
Yeah, well... whatever it was,

233
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,680
你都想错了
You thought wrong.

234
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,060
因为  我才是那个
Because... I'm the one...

235
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,360
采取主动的人
who makes the first move.

236
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,180
你居然在办公室干了他？
You fucked him in your office?

237
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,320
这麽多年来 他是放我桌上
He was the best thing to

238
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,800
最好的东西了
come across my desk in a long time.

239
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,070
你简直难以置信
You're unbelievable.

240
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,290
他也这麽说的
Yeah, that's what he said.

241
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,780
我不是那个意思
I didn't mean it like that.

242
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,980
别跟我说 你的大Q超市就没人乱搞过
Don't tell me, no one's ever had a big O" at the Big Q.

243
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,630
-我可不清楚　　　　   -我可清楚的得 第一手消息
-I wouldn't know. 　　-Well, I would. From first-hand.

244
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,310
我的意思是「第一手消息」
And I mean, "first-hand" experience.

245
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,250
难道你...
Are you saying...

246
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,660
记得去年圣诞我去接你
You remember last Christmas when I came to pick you up

247
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,580
你正忙着布置圣诞节饰品?
And you were setting up for Santa's workshop?

248
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:07,420
别是圣诞老人
Not Santa,

249
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,970
千万别说你干过圣诞老公公
don't tell me you fucked Santa!

250
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,680
即使是我  也不会做这种事的
Ah, even I wouldn't do that.

251
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,210
我对胖子不感兴趣
I'm not into fat.

252
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:16,550
是他的小精灵
His Elf.

253
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,200
不会吧
You didn't!

254
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,970
他的个子都长在另一个地方了
What he lacked in feet he made up for in inches.

255
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,290
我不想听下去了
I don't want to know.

256
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,990
但你最好小心
But you better be careful.

257
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,080
在办公室做
I mean, doing it in your office may be

258
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,780
就算是你  也有些太冒险
A little too high-risk, even for you.

259
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,910
是他自己送上门来的
But he asked for it, he came on to me.

260
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,800
我送他一个上好的机会
I gave him a great opportunity,

261
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,330
和一次上好的性交
And a great fuck.

262
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:38,960
他可没得抱怨
He has no complaints.

263
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,060
我们的荣幸  弗兰妮
Well, it was our pleasure, Franny.

264
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,960
我们也很愉快
Yeah, we had fun too.

265
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,550
随便哪天都有可能
So, I guess it's any day now.

266
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:50,590
别担心  到时我们会去的
Well when it happens, don't worry. We'll be there, okay?

267
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:52,450
向佐伊问好
Love to Zoe.

268
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,430
茉蕾也向你们问好
And Mel sends her love too.

269
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,250
好  再见
Okay. Bye!

270
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,280
-弗兰妮和佐伊向你问好　　　　　　  -那敢情好
-Franny and Zoe send their love.　 -That's nice.

271
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,020
她们真的很感谢我们参加送礼会
They really appreciated the shower

272
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,070
而且很喜欢我给婴儿床做的玩具
And they really liked the mobile I made for over the crib.

273
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,300
你一直这麽激动累不累啊
Don't you ever get tired of being cheery?

274
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,340
才不会累呢
You have no idea.

275
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:16,100
我累了  这些事占用我这麽多时间
Well, I'm tired. I'm tired of putting in these extra hours

276
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,790
好让你可以照顾宝宝去吧  所以你何不就
So you can be with the baby, so why don't you just go,

277
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,550
-看宝宝去          -这不是我一个人的事
-Be with the baby? -It's not just for me.

278
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,340
我希望你别这样说了  盖斯可以
I wish you'd stop saying that. It's so Gus...

279
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,780
由他的妈妈们  而不是由陌生人抚养
Can be raised by one of his mommies instead of a stranger.

280
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,840
现在你可以去照看他了
Now can I please just get back to work?

281
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:28,580
你先为你的行为道歉之後
Not until you apologize for the way

282
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,590
我再去
You behaved at the shower.

283
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,750
我的什麽行为？
How did I behave?

284
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,740
你太无礼了
You were rude.

285
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,730
主要是你有一半时间都心不在焉
Critical, half the time you weren't even there.

286
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,300
那你的行为呢？　假笑得散发光芒呢
What about your behaviour? Smiling and gracious as ever,

287
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,460
好像我们真的没问题一样
As if nothing's wrong.

288
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,410
问题是很多
Oh, plenty is wrong.

289
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,140
但不用让朋友都知道吧
We just don't have to share it with our friends.

290
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,220
也许她们应该知道
Well, maybe we should.

291
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,970
她们也许该知道她们眼中的榜样
Maybe our friends should know that their role models

292
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,870
其实不完美
Aren't so perfect after all.

293
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,570
你要去哪
Where are you going?

294
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,250
去抽烟
For a smoke.

确实很大
It did get big.

298
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,160
掰掰!
Gone!

299
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:09,620
《第六根追缉令》...经典电影
Oh, "Fatal Erection", film classic.

300
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,630
我觉得这没什麽影响
I don't suppose it would do any harm to...

301
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,690
算了  掰
No. Gone.

302
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,800
纯银屌环
Sterling silver cock ring.

303
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,260
戴着很漂亮
Looked fabulous on.

304
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,520
但总是要抛光
But it did require a lot of polishing, so...

305
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:25,640
不要了
Gone!

306
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,200
艾美
Hi, Em!

307
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,560
你们好
Oh, hi.

308
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:30,790
我来拿我的信件
I just came by to get the mail.

309
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:32,590
都在那儿
Ah, it's right there.

310
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,970
你想不想去吃个..
And wanted to see if you wanted to grab a bite to...

311
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:39,450
你在做什麽
What're you doing?

春季大扫除
Spring cleaning.

313
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,330
可现在是12月
It's December.

314
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,690
只是捐些东西给游民
Yeah, I'm just... I'm donating some things to the homeless

315
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,140

还有双头龙
And a double-headed dildo.

318
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:02,900
厚..你要让某位幸运的

319
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,040
流浪妇女爽翻天
Some lucky bag lady very happy.

320
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,480
好吧  我最好还是对你们坦诚
All right, uh, might as well be straight with you.

321
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,100
坦诚  (同"直男")
Straight.

322
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,520
这不是不可能的
It's not impossible, you know.

323
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,270
听着  我知道作为我的朋友
Look, I-I know you guys are my friends,

324
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:20,130
你们会支持我作出的任何选择
And you'll support me in anything I choose to do.

325
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,510
当然
Of course.

326
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,390
以前你把脚趾甲涂上红色指甲油时
Weren't we there to cheer you on

327
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,090
我们不是在一边欢呼吗
when you painted your toenails magenta?

328
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:31,190
我决定  我要发掘自己
I've decided that I need to explore

329
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,120
非同志的那一面
the part of me that isn't gay.

330
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,330
哪一面  请你告诉我  哪一面
And what part, pray tell, would that be?

331
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,640
我参加了这个团体  "看见光明"
So, um, I'm, uh... I've joined this group, "See The Light".

332
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,010
该死
Oh, shit.

333
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,460
他们想要帮助我
A-and they're going to help me

334
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,720
找到真实的我
find my way back to my true self.

335
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,810
现在的你  就是真实的你
Who you are is your true self.

336
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:50,480
不  是我自己放纵才变成这样
No, t-this is who I've allowed myself to become.

337
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,840
胡说八道
That's bullshit!

338
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,070
他们说过你们会这种反应
They said you might react badly.

339
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,250
那帮人还说什麽了
Yeah, what else did they say?

340
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,480
我可以成为上帝希望我成为的那种人
That I could be the person god wants me to be.

341
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,990
老天  艾美特  他们在给你洗脑
Jesus, Emmett, they're brain- washing you.

342
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,850
不  他们没有  他们...
No, they're not. Th-they're...

343
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,740
他们非常...非常友善
they're very... very nice people.

344
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,300
是啊  碰巧这帮人都恨不得
Yeah, who just happen to want every

345
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,660
世上的同志都绝迹
gay person on earth annihilated.

346
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,610
他们还没给你杯「酷爱」有吗   (饮料 暗指洗脑)
They haven't offered you any Kool-Aid yet, have they?

347
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,800
知道吗  我真的不喜欢被嘲笑
You know, I really don't appreciate being mocked.

348
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,760
那是Liza为你亲笔签名的纸巾
That's the napkin that Liza autographed to you.

349
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:17,740
要丢了
Gone.

350
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,720
都是我的错
This is all my fault.

351
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,670
是我求他陪我一起做HIV筛检的
I'm the one who begged him to come with me for my HIV test.

352
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,610
要不是他自己心中有鬼  也不会发生这些
If he hadn't had that scare, this never would have happened.

353
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,260
他自己失去理智不是你的错
You're not responsible for him losing his mind.

354
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,370
也许他需要的是大干一场
Maybe all he needs is one good fuck

355
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,800
然後就会忘掉这些
And he'll forget all about this.

356
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,180
看这个
Look at this.

357
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,760
巨炮扎克要登台表演

358
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,490
那个Ｇ星？
The porn star?

359
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:44,310
我有他的全系列的DVD
I have his entire oeuvreon dvd.

360
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,350
我都不知道他还会说话
I didn't know he could talk.

361
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,260
好奇这是什麽样的表演
I wonder what kind of play it is.

362
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,680
你认为叫「12个饥渴男人」
Well what kind of play do you think something

363
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,100
还能是什麽表演？

感觉太棒了
That feels so good.

366
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,020
有时候  我可以做任何事
There are times I would do anything

367
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,130
只为能抽根烟
For a cigarette.

368
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,640
那太好了
Well, that's good to know.

369
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,150
那你想抽烟时
So, why don't you indulge yourself

370
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,220
为何不放纵下自己
When you feel like it?

371
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,860
她怀孕後我就戒烟了
Ah, I gave up smoking when the baby came.

372
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,070
琳赛担心吸到二手烟
Lindsay was concerned about second-hand smoke and...

373
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:23,110
-她是对的  　　 -琳赛是不是那种
-She's right.　 -Is Lindsay one of these people

374
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,020
永远都是对的人？
Who is always infuriatingly right?

375
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,120
几乎所有事情  真该死
About almost everything, damn her.

376
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,080
有你在就轻松多了
It's just that you were such a relief,

377
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:37,580
我是说那天的送礼会
I mean, at the shower

378
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,060
所有人张口闭口都在谈论孩子
Everyone talking babies, breathing babies.

379
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,030
没错  是有点压抑
Yes, it was a bit oppressive.

380
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,800
别误会  我爱我儿子
I mean, don't get me wrong. I love my son.

383
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,720
介意我再抽一支吗
Do you mind if I bum another?

384
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,430
整包都给你了
Have the whole pack.

385
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,010
不  不用了  一支够了
No, that's okay, one'll do.

386
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,020
谢谢
Thank you.

387
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,340

390

你觉得这代表着什麽
So, what do you think it means?

391
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,310
老天  我们三个中就有两个是拉拉

394
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,920
我觉得这就是缘份
Well, I think that this is fate.

395
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:30,560
需要人倾诉的话
Just when you needed someone

396
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:31,820
我随时奉陪
To tell your troubles to.

397
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,510
倒不是要一五一十地告诉我
Not that you have to tell me,

398
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,860
把我当成你新的挚友

00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,560
别急我也会有一堆抱怨的
And wait till you get a load of mine.

403
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,990
但我希望你知道

413
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,880
你何时开始为工作放弃享乐?
Since when has that ever stopped you?

414
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,110
我以为你在准备SATS   (美国的大学指考)

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,740
更专心  更持久
harder and for longer periods of time.

420
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,330
这麽说来  巴比伦对你健康有益
Hmm, so Babylon is good for your health.

421
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,600
是啊  我头一次听说
Yeah, that's a new one.

422
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:52,470
我来
I'll get it.

423
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:57,730
我自己来
I'll get it.

424
00:19:59,210 --> 00:19:59,840
谁
Yeah?

425
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:00,840
我是基普
Hey, it's Kip.

426
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,340
-谁    -不关你的事
-Who?  -It's none of your business.

427
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,350
-基普  -真的是公事
-Kip?  -And it is business,

428
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,730
信不信由你
Believe it or not.

429
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,730
我还是找别人一起跳舞好了
I guess I'll just have to find someone else to dance with.

430
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:12,960
我也不愁找不到人
It shouldn't be a problem.

431
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,140
然後你学习就能...
And then you can study...

432
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,860
更持久更专心  (双关:又长又硬)
longer and harder.

433
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:22,820
嗨
Hey.

434
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,990
这里难找吗?
You have any trouble finding it?

435
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,500
不  你指示的方向很清楚
No, your directions were perfect.

436
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,180
很好  你把文件都带来了
Good, you brought your work.

437
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,470
这里真赞
Man, this is awesome.

438
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,910
喝点什麽?
Would you like something to drink?

439
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,430
-有啤酒吗?             -有
-Yeah, you got a beer? -Yeah.

440
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,410
想问一下  希望你不介意
So, if you don't mind my asking,

441
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,150
住这样的地方要多少钱?
How much does a place like this cost?

442
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,420
以你现在的薪水肯定付不起
More than you can afford on your current salary.

443
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:55,350
这不会太久
Yeah, but not for long.

444
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:58,810
好了
Yeah.

445
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,210
我相信你会有所成就
I'm sure you're going to go far.

446
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,630
介意我参观一下吗?
You mind if I take a look around?

447
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:06,970
请便
Go ahead.

448
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,680
我马上过来
I'll be right with you.

449
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:26,760
好了
So...

450
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:29,910
我们干嘛不
Why don't we, uh...

451
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,330
准备
Get...

452
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:36,900
开始
Started?

453
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,800
我也这麽想
That's just what I had in mind.

454
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,980
我们已经被关在这审判室整整3天
We've been locked in this jury room for three days.

455
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,980
整整3天  一直试图做出裁决
Three days trying to reach a verdict.

456
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,630
整整3天  一直与外界隔绝
Three days with no human contact.

457
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,630
整整3天  呼吸这里的空气
Three days breathing the air in here,

458
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,170
充斥着男人的体臭
Thick with the smell of man-stench.

459
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,170
说到体臭
Speaking of stench,

460
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,400
你听过那个桥段没?
You ever heard such dialogue?

461
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,860
闭嘴  太精彩了
Shh, it's brilliant.

462
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,700
现在  只有一个办法打破僵局
Well, there's only one way to break this deadlock.

463
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,850
OJ辛普森案的裁决一定就是这样做出的
This must be how they reached the verdict in the O.J. trial.

464
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,340
我心目中「悬而未决的陪审团」(亦指悬着大屌)
That's what I call a hung jury.

465
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,330
太棒了
Bravo!

466
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:04,160
刚刚真是一场非常有趣的表演
Uh... uh... that was a very interesting play.

467
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,320
我认为这是对司法体系
To me it challenges the very nature

468
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,680
本质的深层质疑
of our legal system and asks,

469
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,800
「真有可能获得公正的裁决吗?」
"Is it in fact possible to receive a fair trial?"

470
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,640
我认为我们的陪审组织 构造完美　(暗喻阴茎)
Oh, I'd say our judicial branch is in fine shape.

471
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,230
需要我帮你们签名吗?
So, would you like me to sign your programmes?

472
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:21,300
实际上  巨炮先生
Uh, actually, uh, Mr. O'Tool?

473
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:23,770
不敢相信我在和巨炮扎克说话
I can't believe I'm actually talking to Zack O'Tool.

474
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:29,250
不知道你是否也行进一些私下的演出
We were wondering if you ever did personal appearances?

475
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,620
我周六要为新片
I'm cutting the ribbon at a new "Bed,

476
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,010
"饭、屌、爱" 剪彩
Bondage and Beyond" on saturday.

477
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:35,040
不  我们...我们是说...
Uh, no, we... we meant more...

478
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,450
更私人的...演出
Personal... appearances.

479
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,660
你知道  我们的一个好友
You see, a... a... very good friend of ours

480
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,930
他有点怀疑自己
Is having certain doubts about himself

481
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,080
而你正是他非常喜欢的
And since you are his very favourite

482
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,430
最喜欢的Ｇ星
favourite porn star

483
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,160
我们想如果你可以私下...
We thought a visit from you might...

484
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,540
告诉他叫他来看我的表演
Tell him to come see my show.

485
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,630
或者等到下个月
Or wait till next month,

486
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,710
我的莎士比亚处女作　"科里奥兰纳斯"
I'm making my shakespearean debut as "Coriolanus".

487
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,710
可能那时就太晚了
W-well it might be too late by then.

488
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,730
他现在就需要你
He needs you now.

489
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,930
我们付你一千块美金
We'll pay, $1,000.

490
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,420
-你疯了吗?                         -我还没  不过艾美特快疯了
-Are you out Of your fucking mind? -No, but Emmett is.

491
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,350
茉儿
Mel

492
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,960
茉儿
Mel

493
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,500
很抱歉吵醒你了
Sorry to wake you.

494
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,360
你离开时很生气
You left so angry.

495
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:32,580
现在几点了?
What time is it?

496
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,560
你去哪了?
Where have you been?

497
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,520
没去哪
Nowhere.

498
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:11,760
出去了
Out.

499
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,170
你不告诉我去哪  甚至连一通电话也不打?
Not to tell me where you're going, or even call?

500
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,420
如果发生了什麽事  我和盖斯需要你怎麽办？
What if some- thing happened to gus and I needed you?

501
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,270
我告诉你我去抽支烟
I told you I went for a cigarette.

502
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,360
整个晚上?
All night?

503
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,850
我不能有点自己自由的时间吗?
Aren't I allowed any time to myself?

504
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,210
你当然可以有
Of course you are.

505
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:29,920
我只是担心
I was just worried.

506
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:35,400
你没事吧
Are you all right?

507
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,820
你还好吧
Are you okay?

508
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:56,680
我没事
I'm fine.

509
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,230
我去客房睡
I'm going to go sleep in the guest room.

510
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:23,730
天哪
Oh my god!

511
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,120
你是巨炮扎克
You're Zack O'tool.

512
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,590
我在找艾美特·哈尼卡特
I'm looking for Emmett Honeycutt.

513
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,620
这...这不可能发生的
Okay, that... that's impossible.

514
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,900
为什麽不可能呢?
And why is that?

515
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,280
因为你要找我
Because that's me.

516
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,900
我听说你是我的忠实粉丝
Well, I heard you're one of my biggest fans.

517
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,180
我只是想来看看你有..
So I thought I'd stop by and see just...

518
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,020
多忠实
how big.

519
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:43,580
你全身每一寸肌肉我都了若指掌
I-I know every inch of you.

520
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:44,930
我是说...
I-I mean...

521
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,360
我意思是...我对你从里到外...
I mean I... I... I know you inside and...

我能进去吗?
Mind if I come in?

524
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,770
不介意
No. no.

525
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:55,250
你...随便一点没关系
Make, uh, m-m-make yourself comfortable.

526
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:00,620
你知道人们总说世界很小
You know how p-people always say how much smaller

527
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,900
可是在现实生活中见到电影明星机会又有多少？
M-movie stars seem when you s-see them in real life?

528
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:07,900
你...你真的是...你真的是...
Well, you're... you're a-actually...

529
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,170
不是
Not.

530
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,780
实际上  你看来就像你在那部..
In fact, um, you look just like you did in that, uh,

531
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,470
在「宛如马屌」的场景
Scene in... in "Hung... Hung Like a Horse"

532
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:19,120
你硬上两个直男那片?
Where you rape the two stable boys?

533
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:21,230
对  那是我最喜欢的一部
Yeah, one of my favourites.

534
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,930
你知道我最喜欢的一部是
Oh, uh, you know what one I-I really like

535
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:26,140
「外出就餐」的场景
Is that, uh, scene in "Eating Out",

536
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,950
当你强了两个服务生
When you rape the two busboys.

537
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,720
我很好色的
I'm horny.

538
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,890
我需要发泄
I need some release.

539
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:31,850
天哪
Oh, my god.

540
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:35,210
这是你在「深入极限」第二集的台词
That is exactly what you say in "Deep End, part 2"

541
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,660
当时你强干了那两个泳池男孩
When you rape the two pool boys.

542
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,490
我因此得了金屌奖

543
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:40,490
我知道

544
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:43,230
而且你是实至名归
And it was so deserved.

545
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,560
艾美特
Emmett...

546
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:47,100
不如你来跟我的
How'd you like to make friends with my...

547
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:48,830
小老弟深交一下？
Buddy here.

548
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:50,760
我?
Me?

549
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,850
给巨炮扎克口交?
Blow Zack O'tool?

550
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:58,660
我一直幻想这一刻到来
I have dreamt about this moment all my life.

551
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:00,890
他也期待着你
Well, he's waiting for you.

552
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,140
-怎麽样?               -我正要去开会
-Hey, how's it going?  -I've got a meeting

553
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,550
我20分钟後在办公室外面有个会议
outside the office in 20 minutes

554
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,590
我希望不是像我们在外面开的那种会
I hope it's not like our meeting outside the office.

555
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:20,440
什麽?
What?

556
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,280
我们什麽时候再见?
So when do you want to get together?

557
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,460
叫辛西娅查一下我的排程
Ask Cynthia to check my schedule,

558
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,760
可能在舒尔曼鞋的会议之後
Maybe after the Schulmann meeting.

559
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:29,780
我的意思是吃晚饭
I meant for dinner.

560
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:31,880
我不知道  我快迟到了
I don't know. I'm late.

561
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,510
听着  在你走之前我有些事要说
Listen, before you go, there's something

562
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,380
我想问你
I want to ask you.

563
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,180
你只有30秒
You have 30 seconds.

564
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:41,540
戴夫·哈考特提升为主管了
Dave Harcourt's being bumped up to director,

565
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:43,990
这意味着他那个经理的职位空出来了
Which means his manager position's going to be available.

566
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:45,880
我想得到这个职位
I'd like to go up for it.

567
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,030
而且我希望你能推荐我
And I'd like you to recommend me.

568
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,950
我想我会做好的
I think I'd be damn good.

569
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:51,470
我想也是
I think you would be, too.

570
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:52,900
-谢谢     -但不是现在
-Thanks.  -But not yet.

571
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,420
-为什麽不?  -这太快了
-Why not?   -it's too soon.

572
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,290
那为什麽你一直说我的创意很好?
Then why do you keep telling me how great my ideas are?

573
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,890
创意确实是好  但你还有很多要学
They are, but you still have a lot to learn.

574
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,360
我可以边做边学
I can learn on the job.

575
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:03,870
我欣赏你的野心
I admire your ambition,

576
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,740
可是你需要更多经验
But you need the ex- perience to back it up.

577
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,350
-不要着急       -我没有时间了
-Give it time.  -I don't have time.

578
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,160
到时候他们会把职位给别人的
By then they'll have given it to someone else.

579
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,490
你看  我知道我会很棒的
Look, I know I'd be perfect.

580
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:15,760
我告诉你
I told you.

581
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,040
你还没有准备好
You're not ready.

582
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:24,980
又一个男孩
Another boy.

583
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,220
我们这一群人还没有一个生女孩呢
No one in the group's had a girl yet.

584
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,450
我知道有两个人  哈利和萨姆
I know two guys, Harry and Sam,

585
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:30,780
他们就刚生了一个小女孩
They just had a little girl.

586
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,040
-我是琳赛  　　 -我是玛丽安
-I'm Lindsay.   -Marianne.

587
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,450
送礼会上我有出席
Uh, I was at the shower.

588
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,790
对
That's right.

589
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:44,120
要知道  你们家真的很漂亮
Yeah. you know, you two really have a beautiful home,

590
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,500
你们还有一个漂亮的儿子
And a beau- tiful son.

591
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,270
你有个完美的生活
Hell, you've got a beautiful life.

592
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,510
我希望你们俩能好好照顾对方
I hope you two take care of each other,

593
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:56,090
保护你拥有的一切
You know, protect what you've got.

594
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,880
你不会想失去这些的
You don't want to lose it.

595
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:09,030
弗兰妮和佐伊生了个男孩
Franny and Zoe had a boy.

596
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,140
他取名叫霍顿
His name's Holden.

597
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,540
你来了  茉儿
There you are, Mel.

598
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,820
快来看看我们盖斯新结交的好朋友
Come look at Gus' new best friend.

599
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:22,950
他太漂亮了
He's, uh, gorgeous.

600
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:24,930
是不是有种似曾相识的感觉?
It like deja vu?

601
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,610
我的意思是不久之前
I mean, it wasn't that long ago

602
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,480
你和琳赛就在这里
You and Linz were right here.

603
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:30,690
我记得你们看起来是那麽的喜悦
I remember how radiant you two looked.

604
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,360
你们现在看起来也是那样
You two look the same way.

605
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,710
不好意思我出去一下
Would you guys excuse me?

606
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:44,200
茉儿?
Mel?

607
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:51,500
我们当时的确很开心  不是吗?
We were radiant, weren't we?

608
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,790
那时我们在这里  我们有了我们的盖斯
When we were here, when we had Gus,

609
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,930
我们真的很开心
We were so happy.

610
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,200
这是我人生中最美好的时刻
Yeah, it was the most beautiful moment of my life.

611
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,140
是我们俩的生活
Our lives.

612
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,530
可是我们现在为什麽变成这样?
So how did it get to this?

613
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,870
-怎麽了?   -变成现在这样
-To what?  -to where we are.

614
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,500
我们之间存在问题  但是...
We have our problems, but...

615
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,210
不  不只是问题
No, they're just not problems.

616
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,380
所有事情都不对劲
Everything's wrong.

617
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,420
不是每件事
Not everything.

618
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,160
好的  我一直在想
Look, I've been thinking.

619
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,130
如果和其他人聊聊会有些帮助的话
If it would help to talk to someone,

620
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,110
那正是我们所需要的  就像你说的那样
Then that's what we should do, like you said.

621
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:31,860
发生了一些事情
Something happened.

622
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,270
什麽?
What?

623
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,880
一些事情...
Something...

624
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:42,370
发生了  不过我并不想这样的
happened. I-I didn't mean for it to...

625
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:45,380
但确实发生了
But it did.

626
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,530
我不明白  你什麽...
I don't understand. What do you...

627
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:49,350
你什麽意思?
what do you mean?

628
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,450
你...
You...

629
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,240
你...
You...

630
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:17,490
那个人是谁
Who was it?

631
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:19,860
这不重要
It doesn't matter.

632
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,970
护士马上要来把婴儿抱走了
The nurse has come to get the baby.

633
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:26,620
你们只有几分钟的探望时间
You only have a few more minutes.

634
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,600
对不起  琳赛
I'm sorry, Linz.

635
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:59,180
你叫巨炮扎克去勾引艾美特?
Y-you hooked Emmett up with Zack O'tool?

636
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,280
我真希望我可以在场看看他的表情
I wish I could've been there to see his face

637
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:05,180
-当他打开门                -看到偶像站在自己面前
-When he opened the door.  -Just saw him standing there.

638
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:07,470
据说巨炮扎克的阴茎有12英寸长(30公分!!)
Zack O'tool's supposed to have a 12-inch dick.

639
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,670
你又知道巨炮扎克了?
How do you know who Zack O'tool is?

640
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,710
种马巨炮的名号无人不知
Everybody knows who the manrammer is.

641
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,130
就连在学的学生也知道?
Even schoolboys?

642
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,000
当然了  这是必修课程之一
Of course. That's part of the curriculum.

643
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,530
G星小学堂第一课
Gay porn stars 101.

644
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,370
下面我亲自教授第一课
Yeah, and here's the first lesson

645
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:22,020
有得干的人不用学  有得学的人没得干
Those that can, do, and those that can't watch porn.

646
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,060
待会儿见  孩子们
See ya, boys.

647
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,120
嘿  布莱恩
Hey, Brian.

648
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:37,290
你想跳舞吗?
You wanna dance?

649
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,980
没兴趣
I don't think so.

650
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,610
现在又不是在办公室   我们一起去跳舞吧
We're not in the office now, let's get down.

651
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:42,590
我很忙
I'm busy.

652
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:44,890
至少刚刚还在忙
Or at least I was.

653
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,750
-你嗑了什麽药?    -重剂量可卡因
-What're you on?  -Double bumps.

654
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:49,910
你不该让我这个上司知道的
You shouldn't let senior management know that.

655
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:51,650
我只是在庆祝而已
I'm just celebrating.

656
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,040
今晚是个特殊的日子
See, tonight's a special occasion.

657
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,060
-是吗  -是啊  你没听说吗?
-Oh?   -Yeah, you didn't hear?

658
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,690
吉姆·克莱门斯基得到那个职位了
Jim Clemenski got that position.

659
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,950
就是你不肯向高层推荐我去的那个职位
You know the one you... wouldn't recommend me for?

660
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:00,840
-听着  我告诉过你...  -你欠我的
-Look, I told you...  -You owed it to me.

661
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:02,200
为什麽  就因为我干过你吗?
Why, because I fucked you?

662
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,600
你那时根本也不厉害
You weren't that good.

663
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,780
我是同志  你也是同志
I'm gay, you're gay.

664
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:15,530
是啊  我们都是同志
Yeah, we're all gay.

665
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:18,100
你觉得我就应该欠你一份人情？
Do you think that means I owe you some favour?

666
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,600
如果我们自己都不互相帮助
How else are we supposed to get ahead

667
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,810
怎麽能提高同志在社会中的地位?
if we don't help each other?

668
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,900
像我一样  自己努力
The same way that I did. By helping yourself.

669
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,570
还有  工作表现比其他人都出色
Yeah, and by doing your job better than anyone else.

670
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:32,460
如果你可以做到这些  相信我
If you can do that, then trust me,

671
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:34,830
他们不会管你干的是男人还是女人
They won't give a shit where you stick your dick.

672
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,210
还有不要酒和毒品混着吃
And don't mix that with booze.

673
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,310
看到没  就是我的特别关照
There. I did you a favour.

674
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,850
你到底死去哪?  回我电话
Where the hell are you? Call me.

675
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:46,550
这是我第四次留言给他了
That's the fourth message I've left for him.

676
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,810
他可能被巨炮扎克操翻了
He's probably still recovering

677
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:50,790
还在恢复当中
From having Zack O'Tool fuck his brains out.

678
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,390
如果这可以让他
If that's what it takes for him

679
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,190
不再相信什麽"迎向光明"之类的鬼话
Never to think of "See the Light" again,

680
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,370
那我的一千大洋也就值得了
Then that $1,000 dollars I spent was well worth it.

681
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:55,810
我的老天爷
Oh, god.

682
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,440
看  他在那  小艾  艾美特
Oh, there he is! Em, Emmett!

683
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:05,500
艾美特
Emmett!

684
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,250
你跑去哪了?
Where have you been?

685
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,210
你没听我们的留言吗?
Did you get our messages?

686
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,200
我最近很忙
Uh, I've been busy.

687
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,390
我想也是
I'll bet you have.

688
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,060
去跟我们一起喝一杯吧
So, come have a drink with us.

689
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,910
我  我  不行  我要去见一个人
Uh, I-I can't, I'm... I'm meeting someone.

690
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,690
一个男人吗?
A guy?

691
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:24,980
如果你们非要知道的话  是的
If you must know, yes.

692
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,930
他的名字叫马特
His name's Matt.

693
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:30,970
根据我的统计  叫马特的男人87.5%都很可爱
Guys named matt are, by my calculation, 87.5% cute.

694
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:32,720
看来那方法的确奏效了
It must have worked.

695
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,670
那麽  快跟我们说说吧
So, tell us all about it.

696
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:35,310
说什麽?
All about what?

697
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:36,780
那天晚上的事
The other night.

698
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,120
哪天晚上?
The other night?

699
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,200
你知道  某个神秘人物
You know, when a certain someone

700
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:42,230
挺着装备精良的「重量级巨炮」
With a well-endowed something

701
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,920
过去咚咚地敲开了你的菊花门
Came a tap-tap- tapping at your chamber door.

702
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,140
噢  你是说扎克
Oh, you mean Zack.

703
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,620
「你是说扎克」　听听   他讲得多轻描淡写
"Oh, you mean Zack." I love how he's so blase about it.

704
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:51,230
那的确让我大开眼界
It was quite an eye-opening experience.

705
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:52,530
我非常感激你
And I owe it all to you.

706
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,580
为朋友我可以赴汤蹈火
Oh, anything for a friend.

707
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,400
只要能奏效
Just as long as it did the trick.

708
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,040
确实很有效
It did the trick, all right.

709
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,540
我  我都不知道该怎麽感谢你才好
I-I... really I can't thank you enough.

710
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:02,010
那天让我证明了
It helped me prove to myself that, uh,

711
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:04,570
我可以抵抗任何诱惑
I can resist any temptation,

712
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,560
哪怕面对这个唯一
Even the only man

713
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,180
让我可以光靠意淫就能高潮的男人
I've ever had a spontaneous orgasm over...

714
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:11,330
也同时证明了我卓越的意志力
Provided my resolve is strong enough.

715
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:12,830
什麽?
What?

716
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,350
你是说那天你们什麽也没做吗?
You mean you didn't do anything?

717
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,400
-我们聊天了呀  -就光聊天?
-Talked.       -You talked?

718
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,410
你知道他的老师是乌塔·哈根吗?
Did you know that he studied acting with Uta Hagen,

719
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,810
他可以流利地说三国语言
And he's fluent in three languages?

720
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,780
我付他一千美金是去帮你润菊　可不是陪你聊天的
Yeah, that's not the kind of tongue action I paid $1,000 for.

721
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,390
你花了一千美金?
You paid $1,000?

722
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,620
你他妈的说对了  老兄
You're damn right I did, buddy.

723
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:29,630
他们说你会不择手段地
Wow, they told me you would stop at nothing

724
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:31,880
以防我找到真正的我
To prevent me from finding my true self,

725
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,190
看来他们说对了
And they were right.

726
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,320
艾美特  听我说
Emmett, listen to me.

727
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:37,000
你已经找到真实的自我了
You've already found your true self.

728
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:39,560
你真实的自我就是个超级C妹娘娘
Your true self is a big, nelly queen

729
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:41,590
天生就爱跪在地上替男人吸舔大屌
Who likes to get down on his knees and suck cock,

730
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,090
有一年万圣节
And once a year on Halloween

731
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:45,230
你扮成这世上有史以来
Dress up as the ugliest fucking Cher

732
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,560
最丑爆的雪儿
That the world has ever seen.

733
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,940
这都还没什麽
And that's okay.

734
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,250
你应该赶快远离那些乱七八糟的人
Now you've got to get away from those sicko creeps

735
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,430
以免他们把你给毁了
Before they destroy you.

736
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,240
不  不  实际上
No. no, actually

737
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,800
我应该远离你们
It's you I h-have to get away from.

738
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,290
他们努力让我明白这一点
Uh, they tried to tell me that,

739
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,670
只是我不肯相信他们
Only I didn't want to believe them.

740
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:04,620
现在我终於看见那道光了
But now I see the light.

741
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,050
茉儿?
Mel?

742
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,230
你不必离开的
You don't have to go.

743
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,340
我已经带给了你太多的伤害
I've caused enough harm.

744
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:38,910
如果我不走  只会毁了你  我  还有盖斯
It would only be destructive to you, to me, to Gus.

745
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:41,200
你还没告诉我你要去哪儿
You haven't even told me where you're going.

746
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:43,860
去她那里?
To her?

747
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:48,020
我和她之间从没认真过的
There was never any intention of it,

748
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,040
我们根本就没有想过要进一步发展
On either of our parts, to be anything more than what it was.

749
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:53,700
我要去我表姐丽塔那
I'm going to go stay at my cousin Rita's.

750
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:57,340
就是那个说我们俩永远不会在一起的人吗?
The one with the overbite who never thought we'd make it?

751
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:03,710
天啊
God.

752
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:10,190
我想她应该很高兴自己成功预言了
Well, I think she deserves the prize for being right, huh?

753
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:23,480
我想我没什麽好说的
Well, I guess that's everything for now.

754
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,450
我可以和盖斯独处一会儿吗?
Can I have a moment alone with Gus?

755
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,460
我们认为这些50年代的怀旧元素
We thought the nostalgic reference to the '50s

756
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,800
会让那些用假牙的人产生共鸣
Would appeal to the denture set.

757
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:30,420
提醒他们美好年华已逝吗?
By reminding them that their best years are behind them?

758
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,560
而他们的未来
And that all they have to look forward to

759
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,390
只会更加糟糕
Is further deterioration

760
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:35,350
还要面临死亡
And death.

761
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:37,250
我们认为这会让他们会心一笑
W-we thought it would make them smile.

762
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,810
他们才不敢张嘴大笑
They're afraid to smile.

763
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,540
因为怕他们恶心的假牙会掉下来
Their fucking teeth will fall out.

764
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,210
基普去哪了?
Where's Kip?

765
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:50,080
他打电话来说生病了
Uh, he called in sick.

766
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:52,760
见鬼
Shit.

767
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:55,770
布莱恩  我能跟你谈谈吗?
Brian, can I talk with you?

768
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:57,420
我晚点再来找你们算账
I'll finish berating you later.

769
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,400
-什麽事?　　　-该你来告诉我
-What's up?   -You tell me.

770
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,460
法务部刚刚收到基普·汤玛斯的律师发来的传真
Legal just received this fax from Kip Thomas' lawyer.

771
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:18,630
他说你曾答应帮助汤玛斯的事业
He says that you promised to help Mr. Thomas' career

772
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,470
但必须用性服务来交换
In exchange for sexual favours

773
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,390
当他完成性服务以後
And that when he, um, complied,

774
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:25,470
你却违背承诺
You rescinded your offer.

775
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,780
简直是彻头彻尾的胡说八道
Well, that's complete and utter bullshit.

776
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,190
不管是不是胡说八道  反正他准备提告
Well, bullshit or not, he is suing you...

777
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:32,860
还有公司
and us,

778
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,770
罪名是性骚扰
for sexual harassment.
