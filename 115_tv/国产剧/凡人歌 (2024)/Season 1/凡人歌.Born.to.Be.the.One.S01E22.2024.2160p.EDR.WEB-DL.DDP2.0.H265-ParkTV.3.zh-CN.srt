同志亦凡人 Queer As Folk S01E22 (第一季完)

4
00:00:48,796 --> 00:00:49,806
谁联系上布莱恩了吗?
Has anybody heard from Brian?

5
00:00:49,806 --> 00:00:51,306
我都找了他一整天了
I've been trying to reach him all day.

6
00:00:51,306 --> 00:00:53,306
我也是,  但是他一直不回电话
Me too, but he hasn't returned any of my calls.

7
00:00:53,306 --> 00:00:54,806
希望没出什麽事
I hope he's all right.

8
00:00:54,806 --> 00:00:57,806
我想知道这个阳寿将尽的男人在做些什麽
I wonder how the condemned man's spending his final hours?

9
00:00:57,806 --> 00:00:59,306
-忏悔 　　　　　  -嗑药
-Doing penance? 　-Doing drugs.

10
00:00:59,816 --> 00:01:01,316
尽可能多上一些男人？
Doing as many guys as he can?

11
00:01:02,816 --> 00:01:04,316
猜对了！
Bingo.

12
00:01:04,316 --> 00:01:05,816
也许我们不该帮他庆生
Maybe we shouldn't go through with this.

13
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,316
他明确表示不想别人提起这件事
He made it clear he doesn't want to be reminded.

14
00:01:07,816 --> 00:01:08,816
我们应该提都不要提
We're not even supposed to mention it.

15
00:01:08,816 --> 00:01:10,826
事情可能会变得很糟  很糟
It could get ugly. Really ugly.

16
00:01:10,826 --> 00:01:14,826
无论如何  这事是有历史意义的
Still, it is an event of historic proportion.

17
00:01:14,826 --> 00:01:17,826
像是登陆月球  或者共产主义的沦陷一样
Like the moon landing, or the fall of communism.

18
00:01:17,826 --> 00:01:20,836
我们作为朋友应该纪念一下
It is our duty as friends to commemorate it.

19
00:01:20,836 --> 00:01:22,836
确保他会记住这一天
And make sure he remembers it.

20
00:01:23,336 --> 00:01:25,336
永远记住
Always.

21
00:01:37,346 --> 00:01:39,346
布莱恩
Brian!

22
00:01:39,346 --> 00:01:40,356
早安喔
Hello in there.

23
00:01:40,356 --> 00:01:42,856
起床了  贪睡鬼
Wake up, sleepy head.

24
00:01:42,856 --> 00:01:44,856
你们在这里干什麽
What're you doing here?

25
00:01:44,856 --> 00:01:46,856
你还没听说？
Oh, you mean you haven't heard?

26
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,866
这是你人生最後一天了
It's the last day of the rest of your life.

27
00:01:49,866 --> 00:01:50,866
我死了吗
Did I die?

28
00:01:50,866 --> 00:01:52,866
没有  但你会巴不得你死了
No, but you'll wish you had.

29
00:01:54,366 --> 00:01:55,866
你三十岁了
You're 30.

30
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,876
-走开  -抱歉  爷爷
- Go away! - Sorry, grampa.

31
00:02:07,876 --> 00:02:10,886
我说走开
I said go away.

32
00:02:10,886 --> 00:02:11,886
你可没这麽走运
No such luck.

33
00:02:14,386 --> 00:02:15,386
抓住他
Grab him!

34
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:16,886
小心点  他会咬人的
Careful, he bites.

35
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:17,886
拿着他的Gucci (名牌)
Get his gucci,

36
00:02:18,386 --> 00:02:19,386
普拉达  亚曼尼 (名牌)
Prada, Armani.

37
00:02:19,386 --> 00:02:20,896
天啊  真是个名牌女王
Jesus, what a label queen.

38
00:02:20,896 --> 00:02:21,896
起来啦
Upsy-daisy.

39
00:02:21,896 --> 00:02:23,896
别烦我
Leave me alone.

40
00:02:23,896 --> 00:02:24,896
相信我吧  布莱恩 这绝对会让你
Believe me, Brian, this is going to hurt you

41
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,396
比我们还不舒服
a lot more than it's going to hurt us.

42
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:27,396
抓住他
Get him!

43
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:45,916
这是什麽
What is this?

44
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,416
恭喜你正式加入
Your official membership

45
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:48,916
行将就木同志协会
to the dead faggots society.

46
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:51,426
你是谁  协会的创办人？
And who are you, the fucking founding father?

47
00:02:51,426 --> 00:02:52,696
你知道  真的要
Oh, you know, you really are going

48
00:02:52,696 --> 00:02:53,926
换些新词了
to need to get some new material.

49
00:02:54,426 --> 00:02:56,926
既然你现在是「我们」的一员了
Now that you are... one of "us".

50
00:02:58,926 --> 00:03:00,936
等等  他不该先许个愿吗
Wait, shouldn't he make a wish first?

51
00:03:00,936 --> 00:03:03,436
宝贝  他已经许过了
Oh, hon, he already has.

52
00:03:03,436 --> 00:03:04,936
但他还是三十岁
He's still 30.

53
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:06,436
谁想来块忌日蛋糕
Hey, who wants some deathday cake?

54

忌日蛋糕?
Deathday cake?

56
00:03:08,436 --> 00:03:09,946
我来一点
I'll have some...

57
00:03:09,946 --> 00:03:11,446
既然我没有什麽年龄问题要解决
Since I won't have to deal with the whole age issue

58
00:03:11,446 --> 00:03:13,946
很长时间之内都不会有
for a long, long time.

59
00:03:13,946 --> 00:03:15,446
没这麽糟糕
It's not so bad.

60
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:17,946
忽视你的年龄  向前走
You forget about it, you go on.

61
00:03:17,946 --> 00:03:20,956
特别当你想到你的新生活
Especially when you consider the alternative.

62
00:03:20,956 --> 00:03:22,456
想想有什麽样乐趣在等着你
Think of all the fun you're going to have,

63
00:03:22,456 --> 00:03:24,956
搬到纽约去  和那些帅哥们狂欢
going to New York, partying with the big boys.

64
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:27,456
你的人生才刚开始
You've just only begun to fuck.

65
00:03:27,956 --> 00:03:30,966
我不去纽约了
I'm not going to New York.

66
00:03:30,966 --> 00:03:31,966
什麽
What?

67
00:03:31,966 --> 00:03:32,966

我不去纽约了
I'm not going to New York.

69
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:39,466
那份工作泡汤了
The job fell through.

70
00:03:43,976 --> 00:03:45,476
你他妈怎麽不告诉我
Why the fuck didn't you tell me?

71
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:47,476
告诉你了又能怎样
What difference does it make?

72
00:03:47,476 --> 00:03:48,476
你和大卫有自己的安排
You've got your plans with David.

73
00:03:49,986 --> 00:03:50,986
我知道  但是
I know, but...

74
00:03:50,986 --> 00:03:52,486
没什麽大不了的
It's no big deal.

75
00:03:52,486 --> 00:03:53,986
怎麽会
No big deal?

76
00:03:53,986 --> 00:03:55,986
你一直期待着呢
It's all you've been talking about,

77
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,486
离开这里  不再回头
leaving, not looking back.

78
00:03:58,486 --> 00:03:59,996
你都开始要卖你的阁楼了
You even put your loft on the market.

79
00:03:59,996 --> 00:04:01,996
我可以停止出售
Well, I can just take it off the market.

80
00:04:01,996 --> 00:04:02,996
反正无所谓了
Anyway, It doesn't matter.

81
00:04:02,996 --> 00:04:03,996
我已经死了
I'm already dead.

82
00:04:10,006 --> 00:04:13,006
好  标着「P」的箱子  运到哪里？
Okay, stuff marked "p", where does that go?

83
00:04:13,006 --> 00:04:15,506

All boxes marked with "p" go to Portland.

84
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:17,506

85
00:04:17,506 --> 00:04:20,016
嗨  迈克
Hey, Michael!

86
00:04:20,016 --> 00:04:22,016
你没说搬家公司的人今天就来
You didn't you tell me the moving men were coming today.

87
00:04:22,016 --> 00:04:23,516
我以为我说过了
Oh, I thought I did.

88
00:04:23,516 --> 00:04:26,016
这个是要放仓库的
That one's storage. okay?

89
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,016
我得赶快打包我的东西
I better finish packing my stuff.

90
00:04:28,016 --> 00:04:29,516
不用了
No, it's okay.

92
00:04:31,526 --> 00:04:32,526
可我不知道
But I don't know...

93
00:04:32,526 --> 00:04:34,526
我不知道哪些要放仓库   哪些要带去波特兰
I don't know what's an "s" and what's a "p".

94
00:04:34,526 --> 00:04:37,526
星际队长  机器人  漫画都标着「P」
Captain Astro, robots, comic books are a "p",

95
00:04:38,026 --> 00:04:40,536

101
00:04:50,546 --> 00:04:52,046
你怎麽没跟我说

102
00:04:52,046 --> 00:04:54,546
来不及说啊  我是说　那房子可抢手了
Well, there just wasn't time. I mean, we would've lost it.

103
00:04:54,546 --> 00:04:55,576
你会喜欢那个地方的
You're going to love the place,

104
00:04:55,576 --> 00:04:56,546
有中庭  有泳池

105
00:04:58,046 --> 00:05:00,056
听上去不错, 嗯...

107
00:05:02,056 --> 00:05:03,556

站在那里 看起来美美的
Stand there and look gorgeous,

116
00:05:23,576 --> 00:05:25,076
你最擅长这个了
Which you do so beautifully.

117
00:05:29,576 --> 00:05:33,586
爱上能打点好一切的男人不是很好？
Isn't it great to be in love with a guy who does everything?

118
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,586
是啊
Yeah. Um...

119
00:05:38,586 --> 00:05:40,096
我想我可以去美容沙龙
So I guess I'll just go to the beauty parlour

120
00:05:40,096 --> 00:05:41,596
做做美甲
and get my nails done.

121
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:47,876
要是保证人从美国公民自由协会来电话
When binder calls from the ACLU,

122
00:05:47,876 --> 00:05:48,596
把他接进来
put him right through.

123
00:05:48,596 --> 00:05:51,106
今天真是充满惊喜啊
Well, this day is just full of surprises.

124
00:05:51,106 --> 00:05:53,606
你们是来玩  还是来找律师的
Is this a fun visit or do you two need a good lawyer?

125
00:05:53,606 --> 00:05:55,606
呵, 我们是来吃午饭的
Hm, what we need is a good lunch.

126
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,476
我们觉得我们...应该带布雷克出去
We thought we'd... take Blake out,

127
00:05:59,476 --> 00:06:01,116
如果你允许的话
If you can spare him.

128
00:06:01,116 --> 00:06:03,116
我倒是愿意  可惜他不在
Oh, I'd be happy to, if he was here.

129
00:06:03,116 --> 00:06:04,616
他今天没来
He hasn't come in today.

130
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,616
噢...对
Oh... that's right.

131
00:06:08,616 --> 00:06:10,626
我, 我想起来了
I-I forgot that he...

132
00:06:10,626 --> 00:06:12,126
他今天早上说他不太舒服
He mentioned this morning he wasn't feeling well.

133
00:06:12,626 --> 00:06:15,126
他, 呃..., 对, 我...我想他是得流感了...
He, uh... yeah, I... I think he's got the flu...

134
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:17,126
或是别的病, 呃...
or something and, uh...

135
00:06:17,626 --> 00:06:19,626
他,  他不想传染给别人
H-he didn't want to share his germs with anyone.

136
00:06:19,626 --> 00:06:22,136
真是想得很周到  但说实话  泰德
Well, that's thoughtful but frankly, Teddy,

137
00:06:22,136 --> 00:06:23,156
这不是他第一次跷班了
This isn't the first time.

138
00:06:23,156 --> 00:06:24,636
他即使来上班  也没有什麽效率
And when he is here, he's slow

139
00:06:24,636 --> 00:06:26,636
他完成不了自己的工作
and he doesn't complete tasks we assign him.

140
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,636
其他的合夥人都很生气  他们想开除他
The other partners are pissed. They want him gone.

141
00:06:28,636 --> 00:06:31,146
茉蕾妮,  分机.
Melanie, line one.

142
00:06:31,146 --> 00:06:31,926
我会和他谈的. 我, 我不知道这件事...
I'll talk to him. I-I don't know...

143
00:06:31,926 --> 00:06:32,646
是我的电话
Oh, that's my call.

144
00:06:33,146 --> 00:06:34,146
失陪了,  伙计们
Excuse me, guys.

145
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:37,646
你好  我是茉蕾妮·马库斯
Yes, hi. This is Melanie Marcus.

146
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:38,646
我正在..
Uh, I'm getting...

147
00:06:39,146 --> 00:06:40,656
什麽都别说
Don't say anything.

148
00:06:40,656 --> 00:06:43,156
我?  我才不会说呢
Me? Oh, I wouldn't dream of it.

149
00:06:43,656 --> 00:06:45,656
除非他不想和人分享的不是感冒
Except It's not his germs he didn't want to share.

150
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:47,156
是他的毒品
It's his drugs.

151
00:06:47,656 --> 00:06:49,156
真感激你什麽都没说
Thank you for not saying anything.

152
00:06:49,156 --> 00:06:51,666
你为什麽总是这麽愤世嫉俗呢
Why do you always have to be so fucking cynical?

153
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,666
我没有  不过你知道吗
I'm not cynical. But you know what?

154
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:57,166
我宁愿愤世嫉俗  也不想逃避现实
I'd rather be fucking cynical than in fucking denial.

155
00:07:01,176 --> 00:07:04,676
他感冒了 喉咙痛
Well, he has a cold and a sore throat

156
00:07:04,676 --> 00:07:07,076
因为发烧全身酸痛
accompanied by the aches and pains of fever

157
00:07:07,076 --> 00:07:08,676
还有鼻塞
and congestion.

158
00:07:08,676 --> 00:07:11,186
如果症状持续  我们就得看医生了
If the symptoms persist, we'll consult a physician.

159
00:07:11,186 --> 00:07:12,686
现在,  我们去虾船吃饭吧
Now, let's go to the shrimpboat.

160
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:17,686
你会喜欢这次的烧烤的,  小詹
You'll love the barbecue, Jen.

161
00:07:17,686 --> 00:07:19,186
这是一项同志亲友团的传统
It's a PFLAG tradition.

162
00:07:19,186 --> 00:07:21,196
黛比发起的
Debbie started it.

163
00:07:21,196 --> 00:07:23,196
还有这麽多棘手的问题要解决
There're so many serious issues to deal with,

164
00:07:23,196 --> 00:07:24,696
我只是想和你的孩子一起开心一天
I just thought it was a nice way to have fun with your kids.

165
00:07:24,696 --> 00:07:26,696
我都等不及了
I'm looking forward to it.

166
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,196
我不知道贾斯汀想不想去
I'm not that sure how eager Justin's going to be.

167
00:07:29,196 --> 00:07:30,206
我会劝他的
I'll work on him.

168
00:07:32,206 --> 00:07:34,706
他们把所有东西都印到邮票上了
They've got everything on stamps these days.

169
00:07:34,706 --> 00:07:35,706
音乐家,  鸟类,
Composers, birds,

170
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:37,706
甚至还有三个臭皮匠
Even the three stooges.

171
00:07:37,706 --> 00:07:39,206
他们什麽时候才会印上「超级名gay」
So when are they going to have "famous fags"?

172
00:07:40,716 --> 00:07:42,716
亲爱的  你能被印到69分的邮票上去 (69意指性姿势)
You can be on the 69-cent stamp, honey.

173
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:46,716
嗨,  妈妈
Hey, mom.

174
00:07:51,226 --> 00:07:53,226
你要和你妈去参加同志亲友团的烧烤聚餐
You're going with your mom to the PFLAG barbecue

175
00:07:53,226 --> 00:07:55,226
我不想听到你说一个「不」
And I don't want to hear another word about it.

176
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:56,226
好
Okay.

177
00:07:59,226 --> 00:08:01,236
这些年来迈克不也乖乖听我的话去了吗
How do you think I got Michael to go all those years?

178
00:08:04,236 --> 00:08:06,736
这次他却去不了, 自从他成年以来可是头一回
It's the first one he's gonna have missed since he was 18.

179
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,236
至少他找到了归属
Well, at least he's where he belongs,

180
00:08:09,236 --> 00:08:10,246
和他爱的男人在一起
with the man he loves.

181
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:12,246
但却身处地球另一端
On the opposite side of the goddamn world.

182
00:08:12,246 --> 00:08:14,246
这样想吧,  黛比
Look at it this way, Deb;

183
00:08:14,746 --> 00:08:15,746
你都拥有他这麽久了
You've had him all this time.

184
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,246
听听
Listen to him.

185
00:08:18,746 --> 00:08:21,256
跟你说吧　我们可以一起盯着贾斯汀
Tell you what, we can share Justin.

186
00:08:21,256 --> 00:08:23,256
很快他也会离开
Pretty soon he'll be gone too.

187
00:08:23,256 --> 00:08:25,256
他就要毕业啦
Graduation's coming up...

188
00:08:25,256 --> 00:08:26,256
参加毕业舞会...
The prom...

189
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,256
毕业舞会
The prom.

190
00:08:29,256 --> 00:08:31,766
当年我的伴儿是康妮·康斯特洛
I went with Connie Costello.

191
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:34,266
200磅的胖子裹在紫色绸缎里
200 pounds wrapped in purple satin.

192
00:08:34,766 --> 00:08:36,266
看起来简直像只人形大葡萄
She was like a stuffed grape leaf.

193
00:08:37,766 --> 00:08:40,276
当然,  我无法和意中人共赴舞会
Of course, I couldn't take who I really wanted to.

194
00:08:40,776 --> 00:08:42,276
兰斯·罗科
Lance Rocco.

195
00:08:42,276 --> 00:08:43,276
兰斯·罗科
Lance Rocco.

196
00:08:44,276 --> 00:08:46,776
舌吻高手
Pisser of a kisser.

197
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,276
我和康妮跳舞跳得欢
I wound up dancing with Connie.

198
00:08:49,776 --> 00:08:50,786
他却压根没来
He wound up not going at all.

199
00:08:51,786 --> 00:08:52,786
反正我也不准备去
Yeah, I'm not going either.

200
00:08:55,286 --> 00:08:56,786
为什麽不去?
Why not?

201
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,786
维克也说了啊,  那是给异性恋去的.
Like vic said, it's for straight kids.

202
00:08:58,786 --> 00:09:01,296
人人都能去毕业舞会啊,  不管你是异男或同志
I think the prom's for everyone, straight or gay.

203
00:09:01,296 --> 00:09:02,796
正解
That's right.

204
00:09:02,796 --> 00:09:05,796
那可是...成年的必经之路
It's one of those... those growing up experiences.

205
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:07,296
你知道, 那个词儿到底怎麽说来着?
You know, what in the hell do they call it?

206
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,296
成人礼?
Rites of passage?

207
00:09:08,296 --> 00:09:09,296
没错
That's it.

208
00:09:09,796 --> 00:09:11,306
就好比...给出你的第一次
It's like... like losing your virginity

209
00:09:11,306 --> 00:09:14,306
或是...或是...取得驾照
or... or... or getting your driver's license.

210
00:09:14,306 --> 00:09:16,806
我不想看到你因为觉得自己是异类
I'd just hate to see you deprive yourself of the experience

211
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,306
而失去宝贵的人生经历
because you think you don't belong.

212
00:09:41,336 --> 00:09:42,336
嗨,  小泰
Hey, Teddy.

213
00:09:43,836 --> 00:09:44,836
你去哪儿了?
Where've you been?

214
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:46,836
出去了
Out.

215
00:09:48,836 --> 00:09:49,836
你感觉怎样?
How're you feeling?

216
00:09:51,846 --> 00:09:53,346
棒极了
Great.

217
00:09:53,846 --> 00:09:54,846
那你怎麽没去上班
Then why weren't you at work?

218
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,346
我今天过去想接你一起吃饭
I stopped by to take you out to lunch,

219
00:09:58,346 --> 00:09:59,846
茉蕾妮说你请了病假没去
Melanie said you'd called in sick.

220
00:10:05,356 --> 00:10:07,356
是啊,  我, 呃...
Yeah. I had, uh...

221
00:10:09,856 --> 00:10:12,866
是有点小不舒服
one of those 24-hour bug things. but...

222
00:10:13,866 --> 00:10:15,366
但现在感觉好多了
I'm feeling a lot better now.

223
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,866
你最好别再请假了
Well, you'd better not miss any more days because...

224
00:10:20,376 --> 00:10:20,876
不然他们可能
They might...

225
00:10:23,876 --> 00:10:25,876
别担心
Don't worry.

226
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:31,386
明天早上一起来
I'll be there all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed...

227
00:10:32,886 --> 00:10:34,386
我就焕然一新  精神奋发地去上班
First thing in the morning.

228
00:10:34,386 --> 00:10:36,886
我保证
Promise.

229
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,386
很好
Good...

230
00:10:38,386 --> 00:10:40,896
你知道, 因为你最近, 一直都表现很好
You know, because y-you're doing... you're doing so well.

231
00:10:41,396 --> 00:10:43,396
真的...很好
So... really well.

232
00:10:43,396 --> 00:10:45,396
我不想看到你...
I-I-I'd hate to see you...

233
00:10:47,896 --> 00:10:49,396
干我
Fuck me.

234
00:10:49,396 --> 00:10:50,906
什麽?
What?

235
00:10:50,906 --> 00:10:52,406
我说了
I said,

236
00:10:52,406 --> 00:10:53,406
「快干我」
"fuck me".

237
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:56,906
布雷克,  你有在听我说吗?
Blake, a-are you listening to me?

238
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:57,906
你没听到吗
Are you listening to me?

239
00:10:59,406 --> 00:11:00,416
你到底...
What're you... ?

240
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,416
你到底在...
What're you...?

241
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,416
我...想要你
I... want you...

242
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:09,416
狠狠地干我, 一整晚
to fuck the shit out of me, all night long.

243
00:11:11,926 --> 00:11:13,426
好吧,  停
All right, stop it.

244
00:11:14,426 --> 00:11:15,426
停下
Stop it.

245
00:11:15,426 --> 00:11:16,926
住手
Stop!

246
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,426
我说了快住手
I said stop it!

247
00:11:18,426 --> 00:11:19,426
我欲火焚身
I want it!

248
00:11:21,936 --> 00:11:22,936
求你了?
Please?

249
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,436
求求你
Come on.

250
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:37,946
快满足我
Give it to me.

251
00:12:20,996 --> 00:12:22,496
我要双份伏特加
Double absolut.

252
00:12:22,496 --> 00:12:23,496
健怡可乐
Diet pepsi.

253
00:12:23,996 --> 00:12:24,996
一杯柑曼怡柯梦
Grand marnier cosmo.

254
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,496
我的天啊
Oh, my god.

255
00:12:27,996 --> 00:12:29,496
怎麽
What?

256
00:12:29,496 --> 00:12:31,506
这有可能是最後一次
This may be the last time we're ever standing here

257
00:12:31,506 --> 00:12:33,006
我们几个人一起在这儿痛饮了
at this bar ordering drinks.

258
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,506
就这个吗?  我还以为是什麽大不了的呢
Is that all? I thought it was something serious.

259
00:12:40,516 --> 00:12:42,516
你说波特兰也有巴比伦这样的夜店吗?
Think they have a Babylon in Portland?

260
00:12:42,516 --> 00:12:45,016
那要看波特兰有没有同志了
Huh, you think they have any queers in Portland?

261
00:12:45,016 --> 00:12:48,016
至少有两个我们认识的过去了
Well, there will be at least two that we know of.

262
00:12:48,016 --> 00:12:49,516
你们应该会去看我吧?
Well, you're going to come and visit me, won't you?

263
00:12:50,016 --> 00:12:51,026
如果你想要有人来看你,
If you wanted visitors,

264
00:12:51,026 --> 00:12:53,526
最好还是搬到南部海岸去住
you probably should've moved to south beach.

265
00:12:53,526 --> 00:12:56,526
噢..  小迈
Oh... Mikey.

266
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:59,026
我们可能再也见不着了
This might be the last time we see each other.

267
00:13:00,536 --> 00:13:03,536
我会想死你的
I'm going to miss you so much.

268
00:13:03,536 --> 00:13:06,036
噢,不,  我不会哭的
No. no, I'm not going to cry.

269
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,036
玛莎史都华说过 (生活风格大师)
As Martha Stewart says,

270
00:13:08,536 --> 00:13:09,536
当生活抛弃了你
when life gets you down,

271
00:13:09,536 --> 00:13:11,046
那就开个派对吧
have a party.

272
00:13:11,046 --> 00:13:12,826
这就是我要做的事
So that's what I'm going to do.

273
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:14,546
我要为你办个派对
I'm going to give you a party.

274
00:13:15,046 --> 00:13:16,546
好, 得定一个主题
Okay, we'll need a theme.

275
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,546
要一个主题
Need a theme, um...

276
00:13:18,546 --> 00:13:20,556
波特兰那边的人到底有什麽啊?
What the fuck do they have in Portland?

277
00:13:21,056 --> 00:13:22,556
伐木工大叔吗?
Lumberjacks?

278
00:13:22,556 --> 00:13:24,556
或许某天我真会来看看你
Oh, maybe I will come pay you a visit.

279
00:13:25,056 --> 00:13:26,056
老天!  我想到了
Oh my god! I've got it.

280
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:27,056
法兰绒
Flannel.

281
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,056
我们都得穿法兰绒格子
We'll all wear flannel.

282
00:13:28,556 --> 00:13:30,056
那太好了
Oh, that's perfect.

283
00:13:30,056 --> 00:13:32,066
如果你没有半件的话  还能去借
And if you don't have any, you could always borrow some

284
00:13:32,066 --> 00:13:33,566
向琳赛和茉蕾妮借
from Lindsay and Melanie.

285
00:13:35,066 --> 00:13:36,066
我呢
There, I...

286
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:38,066
我已经感觉好多了
I feel much better already.

287
00:13:39,066 --> 00:13:40,576
我的妈呀
Oh, my god.

288
00:13:41,076 --> 00:13:43,576
我此後的人生将会如此空虚
My life's going to be so empty.

289
00:13:43,576 --> 00:13:45,576
你还有我啊,  我哪儿都不去
You still have me. I'm not going anywhere.

290
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:47,576
万岁啊
Hurray.

291
00:13:54,586 --> 00:13:56,086
布莱恩
Brian...

292
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,586
布莱恩
Brian!

293
00:14:02,596 --> 00:14:04,096
等等,  布莱恩
Brian, wait a second.

294
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:07,596
回家打包去
Go home and pack.

295
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,596
有大卫在弄呢
David's taking care of that.

296
00:14:08,596 --> 00:14:11,106
他...把一切都料理好了
He's... he's taking care of everything.

297
00:14:11,606 --> 00:14:13,606
你到了传说中的波特兰後  有什麽打算
What do you plan on doing when you get to fabulous Portland?

298
00:14:13,606 --> 00:14:15,106
你也准备把什麽都丢给大卫管吗
Are you going to leave all that up to David too?

299
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:17,606
我根本来不及考虑这些
I haven't had time to think about it.

300
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,106
我们一直忙得无暇顾及
You know, we've just been so busy.

301
00:14:20,106 --> 00:14:23,116
忙着出租他的房屋  处理他的工作
Leasing his house, and... and taking care of his practice

302
00:14:23,116 --> 00:14:24,116
卖掉他的汽车
and shipping his car...

303
00:14:24,116 --> 00:14:25,116
去他妈的「他的」
Fuck "his".

304
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,116
「你们」的呢？
What about "yours"?

305
00:14:33,126 --> 00:14:35,126
真他妈,  管他呢
You know what, fuck it.

306
00:14:35,126 --> 00:14:36,626
你爱怎麽样怎麽样吧
Do whatever you want.

307
00:14:48,636 --> 00:14:50,646
他对你来说太嫩了
He's far too young for you.

308
00:14:52,646 --> 00:14:53,646
想跳舞吗?
Do you want to dance?

309
00:14:53,646 --> 00:14:55,646
老骨头一把了
No, at my advanced years

310
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:57,646
怕跳舞会摔断尾椎骨啊
I might fall and break my hip.

311
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:00,656
你别再机机歪歪了好吗?
Nah, would you stop with the old age shit already?

312
00:15:01,156 --> 00:15:02,156
你又不是40岁
It's not like you're 40.

313
00:15:03,656 --> 00:15:05,156
周五晚上有何打算
What're you doing on friday night?

314
00:15:05,156 --> 00:15:06,656
周五啊,周五
Friday, friday, friday...

315
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,056
不知道哇, 我的记忆力
I don't know, my short- term memory's

316
00:15:08,056 --> 00:15:09,156
大不如前了
not what it used to be.

317
00:15:09,156 --> 00:15:10,666
你愿意和我一起去毕业舞会吗?
Do you wanna come to my prom with me?

318
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,666
以什麽身份?  你的监护人吗?
As what? Your chaperone?

319
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:15,666
我的舞伴
As my date.

320
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,166
呵..我真想去
Huh... I'd love to.

321
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:19,666
真的吗
Yeah?

322
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,676
但我的晚礼服还在乾洗店那儿没拿回来
But my prom dress is still at the dry cleaners.

323
00:15:21,676 --> 00:15:23,676
得了吧
Oh, come on.

324
00:15:23,676 --> 00:15:25,176
你是疯了还是傻了?
Are you out of your mind?

325
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:27,176
去找个女孩子吧
Go and ask some girl.

326
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,176
我不想找女孩子
I don't want to go with some girl.

327
00:15:30,176 --> 00:15:33,186
我想约我真正喜欢的人
I want to go with someone I care about.

328
00:15:33,186 --> 00:15:36,186
我就是喜欢个男人,  谁管我?
If that happens to be a guy, who cares?

329
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,186
对阿, 那正是我现在需要的
You know, that's just what I need,

330
00:15:38,186 --> 00:15:40,186
混进一堆小屁孩的舞会里
to be at a dance with a bunch of fucking 18-year-olds.

331
00:15:40,186 --> 00:15:42,196
我以为你喜欢跟小屁孩混一起打炮呢
I thought you liked fucking 18-year-olds.

332
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,196
去买一束胸花
Go buy a corsage...

333
00:15:49,196 --> 00:15:50,706
送给其他人吧
for someone else.

334
00:16:03,216 --> 00:16:05,216
某人看起来「活跃」了一整晚啊
Somebody looks all fucked out.

335
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:07,716
说得没错
Somebody is.

336
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:10,216
看来某人需要补充点维他命啊
Somebody needs vitamins.

337
00:16:10,216 --> 00:16:12,226
来杯咖啡
Coffee... over here.

338
00:16:12,226 --> 00:16:14,226
布雷克和我干了一整晚
Blake and I had sex all night.

339
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:17,226
我只睡了半小时
Got a half- hour's sleep.

340
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:20,736
这就是所谓「奢侈的烦恼」
Okay, this is what we call a "high-end" problem.

341
00:16:21,236 --> 00:16:23,236
只不过  我不是和他做
Only it wasn't him I was fucking.

342
00:16:24,736 --> 00:16:25,236
是和嗑了药的他
It was some drug.

343
00:16:29,236 --> 00:16:31,246
该死别那麽沾沾自喜
Don't look so goddamn smug.

344
00:16:31,246 --> 00:16:33,246
你是对的  好吗  高兴了吗
You were right, okay? You happy?

345
00:16:33,246 --> 00:16:36,246
不  泰德  我没有幸灾乐祸
No... Teddy, I'm not happy.

346
00:16:38,746 --> 00:16:39,246
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

347
00:16:44,256 --> 00:16:47,256
我他妈该怎麽办
What the fuck am I going to do?

348
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,756
很简单  亲爱的
Simple, honey.

349
00:16:49,756 --> 00:16:51,266
喝了你的咖啡
You're going to drink your coffee.

350
00:16:51,266 --> 00:16:52,766
给你鲜奶油
Here's the cream.

351
00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:56,766
喝完就回家
Then you're going to go home...

352
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,266
换掉门锁
And you're going to change the locks.

353
00:16:58,766 --> 00:17:01,276
把他拒之门外  就当没他这个人
Just shut him out, like he doesn't exist?

354
00:17:01,276 --> 00:17:04,776
要嘛这样  要麽你就继续自欺欺人
Well, that or you can keep lying to yourself,

355
00:17:04,776 --> 00:17:06,276
继续为他找藉口
you know, making excuses for him,

356
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,776
继续为他每次的消失惶恐不安
Living in a state of panic every time he disappears,

357
00:17:08,776 --> 00:17:11,286
不知他是死还是活
not knowing if he's alive or dead.

358
00:17:11,286 --> 00:17:13,786
然後当他终於一团糟地出现时
And then when he finally shows up a mess,

359
00:17:14,286 --> 00:17:18,786
你继续为再次挽救他喜极而泣
having the supreme joy of putting him back together again.

360
00:17:18,786 --> 00:17:20,286
我  我不能
I-I... I can't.

361
00:17:20,286 --> 00:17:21,796
我  我不能那麽做
I... I can't do that.

362
00:17:22,296 --> 00:17:23,296
-我  我　　　　　　  -好吧
-I just... I just... -Okay.

363
00:17:23,296 --> 00:17:25,296
好吧  好吧
Okay, okay.

364
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:31,306
那麽  还有第二条路可走
Then, um... Then let's try door number two.

365
00:17:32,806 --> 00:17:36,306
「贝蒂姑姑之家」
"Aunt Betty's B & B".

366
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:37,976
他可以成为
He can, uh... He can join the

367
00:17:37,976 --> 00:17:39,806
众多耀眼嘉宾中的一员
long list of lustrous guests.

368
00:17:39,806 --> 00:17:41,816
就像「利兹和莱莎」　[女子乐队]
Like Liz and Lisa.

369
00:17:43,816 --> 00:17:46,316
况且
Plus, uh...

370
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:47,816
这是个很好的考验
It'll be a good test...

371
00:17:48,316 --> 00:17:49,816
看他更爱谁
to see who he loves more,

372
00:17:51,326 --> 00:17:52,326
是你
You...

373
00:17:53,326 --> 00:17:54,326
还是兴奋剂
or crystal.

374
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:58,826
死屁精！
Fag!

375
00:17:59,826 --> 00:18:00,836
你大爷的  赫伯
Fuck you, Hobbs.

376
00:18:04,336 --> 00:18:06,336
你还好吗
You okay?

377
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:07,836
该死的混蛋
What an asshole.

378
00:18:08,836 --> 00:18:09,506
谢天谢地
Thank god

379
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:12,346
这辈子再也不用见到他
I won't have to see him again for the rest of my life.

380
00:18:12,846 --> 00:18:15,346
是啊  或是这里的任何人
Yeah, or... anyone else here either.

381
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,346
我不是说你
I wasn't talking about you.

382
00:18:21,356 --> 00:18:23,856
你去舞会吗
So, are you going to the prom?

383
00:18:24,356 --> 00:18:25,856
你开玩笑吗
Are you kidding?

384
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:26,856
我就知道
I know.

385
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:27,856
我本来也没打算去
I wasn't gonna go either,

386
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,856
但黛比说这是一种成人礼
but Deb said it was this rite of passage

387
00:18:30,356 --> 00:18:31,576
如果错过它  我一定会
and if I missed it, then I would

388
00:18:31,576 --> 00:18:32,866
懊悔终生
regret it for the

389
00:18:32,866 --> 00:18:35,366
-所以我邀请了布莱恩  -不会吧
-So I asked Brian.   -No!

390
00:18:35,366 --> 00:18:36,366
但他拒绝了我
He turned me down, though.

391
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,866
真该死
Oh, shit!

392
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:39,866
你能想像吗
Can you imagine?

393
00:18:39,866 --> 00:18:42,376
-他要去了其他人一定吓疯了 　　　　 -我知道
-People's heads would've exploded. -I know.

394
00:18:42,376 --> 00:18:43,376
一定大快人心  就像在说
It would've been the perfect

395
00:18:43,376 --> 00:18:45,876
「去你妈的  永别了狗屁圣詹姆士学院」
"Fuck you and farewell to St. James Academy".

396
00:18:52,886 --> 00:18:53,886
我很想你  达芙妮
I missed you, Daph.

397
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:56,886
我也是
You too.

398
00:18:59,386 --> 00:19:00,896
那
So...

399
00:19:00,896 --> 00:19:02,396
我们俩一起去怎麽样
How about you and me going together?

400
00:19:03,896 --> 00:19:04,896
作为舞伴吗
Like a date?

401
00:19:04,896 --> 00:19:06,896
不  像朋友那样
Mmm, like friends...

402
00:19:08,896 --> 00:19:10,396
最好的朋友
Best friends.

403
00:19:10,396 --> 00:19:11,906
只是
Only...

404
00:19:12,406 --> 00:19:13,406
不再尴尬了？
Weirdness over?

405
00:19:14,406 --> 00:19:16,406
绝对不会了
Weirdness definitely over.

406
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,906
好
Okay.

407
00:19:18,906 --> 00:19:23,906
他邀请你去  这真是太可爱了
Oh, I think that's so adorable that he asked you...

408
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:26,916
尽管你们年龄差距有点大
Despite the somewhat questionable difference in your ages

409
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,416
事实上他在情感上比你还要成熟12岁
and the fact that emotionally he's 12 years your senior.

410
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:31,926
我不去  太老了
Not going. Too old.

411
00:19:31,926 --> 00:19:34,426
你30岁了  我知道
Oh, so you're 30. I know,

412
00:19:34,426 --> 00:19:37,426
太残酷了  但这是每个人都必须经历的
it's so traumatic, but it is something we all go through.

413
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,426
当然你还得够幸运能活到这把岁数
If you're lucky enough to live that long.

414
00:19:39,426 --> 00:19:41,936
但这有到像世界末日一样吗?
But to carry on like it's the end of your life?

415
00:19:41,936 --> 00:19:42,936
有
It is.

416
00:19:42,936 --> 00:19:44,436
这是全新的开始
It's the beginning.

417
00:19:44,436 --> 00:19:47,436
从全新的角度审视自己
A whole new way of thinking about yourself.

418
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,946
体会一种全新的归属感
Feeling a whole new sense of entitlement,

419
00:19:51,446 --> 00:19:52,946
和成就感
and accomplishment.

420
00:19:55,446 --> 00:19:58,446
这还真像欧蕾抗皱产品的广告词
That's from the "La Jeunesse" anti-aging commercial.

421
00:20:00,446 --> 00:20:01,956
那广告词是我写的
I wrote that fucking copy.

422
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:09,956
好吧  算我引用了大师的名言
Okay. well, I guess I only quote from the masters. hmm.

423
00:20:10,456 --> 00:20:11,466
但事实也确实如此
But it's the truth.

424
00:20:13,466 --> 00:20:15,466
我期待皱纹  白头发
I want wrinkles, I want to have grey hair.

425
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:18,466
期待盖斯让我抱孙子
I want Gus to make me a grandmother.

426
00:20:18,466 --> 00:20:20,976
我还想和茉蕾妮一起慢慢变老
I want to grow old with Melanie.

427
00:20:20,976 --> 00:20:22,976
你想让我在这里吐出来吗
Do you want me to puke right here?

428
00:20:24,476 --> 00:20:26,976
我不要白头发和皱纹
I don't want grey hair and wrinkles.

429
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,976
也不想当爷爷
I don't want to be a grandfather.

430
00:20:29,476 --> 00:20:30,476
当然更不想
And I definitely...

431
00:20:30,476 --> 00:20:33,486
和茉蕾妮一起变老
don't want to grow old with Melanie...

432
00:20:33,486 --> 00:20:35,986
-或者其他任何人   -那你想要什麽
-Or anyone else.  -What do you want?

433
00:20:40,486 --> 00:20:41,496
这个
This.

434
00:20:42,496 --> 00:20:43,496
很好看
It's very beautiful.

435
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:47,996
也许你是对的
You know, maybe you're right.

436
00:20:49,496 --> 00:20:52,006
也许我是该庆祝30岁的到来
Maybe I should celebrate turning 30.

437
00:20:54,006 --> 00:20:56,006
给自己买个特别的礼物
Give myself something very special.

438
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,506
这就对了
Now you're talking.

439
00:21:01,516 --> 00:21:03,516
大卫  大卫
David? David?

440
00:21:03,516 --> 00:21:05,516
-怎麽了  　　　-我的法兰绒格纹衬衫呢
-What is it?   -Where's my plaid flannel?

441
00:21:05,516 --> 00:21:07,016
我一直放在这里
It used to be right here.

442
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,516
我打包了
Oh, oh, I packed it.

443
00:21:08,516 --> 00:21:10,016
那我去艾美特的聚会穿什麽
What am I supposed to wear to Emmett's party?

444
00:21:10,516 --> 00:21:12,026
大家都要穿法兰绒格纹的
You're supposed to wear flannel.

445
00:21:12,026 --> 00:21:13,026
这里
Here.

446
00:21:15,026 --> 00:21:16,526
-试试这件  　　-谢了
-Try that on.  -Thanks.

447
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,026
一定很适合你
You'll look good in that.

448
00:21:18,526 --> 00:21:20,026
我穿太紧  就给你好了
That's too small on me. You keep it.

449
00:21:20,026 --> 00:21:22,536
我不要你的旧衣服
I don't need your hand-me-downs.

450
00:21:22,536 --> 00:21:25,036
我只要  有人听我说话
What I need is... Somebody who listens to me.

451
00:21:28,536 --> 00:21:29,536
怎麽了
What?

452
00:21:31,046 --> 00:21:32,546
我是说
Well, to think about...

453
00:21:32,546 --> 00:21:34,046
到波特兰後我要做什麽
w-what I'm going to do when we get to Portland.

454
00:21:34,046 --> 00:21:35,546
我们甚至还没讨论过
I mean, we haven't even discussed it.

455
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,546
好吧  那现在讨论
Okay, let's discuss it.

456
00:21:40,546 --> 00:21:44,056
好  我觉得
W-well, I... I thought that, um...

457
00:21:44,056 --> 00:21:46,556
我应该不会再到超市工作了
You know, maybe I wouldn't work at another Big Q,

458
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:48,556
所以我可能会
you know, that maybe I'd, uh...

459
00:21:48,556 --> 00:21:51,566
做些完全不同的尝试
Um... I-I'd try something totally different.

460
00:21:52,066 --> 00:21:53,066
全新的方向
You know, a whole new track,

461
00:21:53,566 --> 00:21:55,566
甚至回到大学
maybe even go back to college.

462
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:57,566
嗯
Um...

463
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,066
我差点忘了
Uh... oh, I just remembered,

464
00:21:59,566 --> 00:22:01,076
我告诉过要租房的人
I told the people that are leasing the house

465
00:22:01,076 --> 00:22:03,076
我们走前会把纱门装上
I'd put the screen doors in before we left.

466
00:22:03,076 --> 00:22:04,576
让我来吧
Oh, I can do it.

467
00:22:04,576 --> 00:22:08,076
没事  我来就好
Oh, that's okay. I'll take care of it.

468
00:22:08,576 --> 00:22:09,826
以前每年都是我
Well, I used to help my mom put

469
00:22:09,826 --> 00:22:11,086
替我妈装纱门的
on the screen doors every year.

470
00:22:11,586 --> 00:22:14,086
交给我  我手上功夫很棒  还记得吗
It's okay, I'm good with my hands, remember?

471
00:22:29,096 --> 00:22:30,596
-嗨  亲爱的  -快进来  快进来
-Hi, honey.  -Come in, come in, come in.

472
00:22:30,596 --> 00:22:32,606
好
Okay!

473
00:22:32,606 --> 00:22:35,106
嗨  宝贝
Hi, baby. aww...

474
00:22:39,106 --> 00:22:40,606
见鬼了　好像在森林里
I feel like I'm in a fuckin' forest.

475
00:22:44,116 --> 00:22:46,116
连闻起来都他妈的像
It even smells like a fuckin' forest.

476
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:47,616
这是松树味喷雾
That would be the miracle

477
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,616
带来的奇蹟
of pine-scented spray.

478
00:22:49,616 --> 00:22:51,126
哦  老天
Oh, god!

479
00:22:53,126 --> 00:22:55,126
妈　大家特地把这里布置成西北的风格
It's supposed to be the great northwest, ma.

480
00:22:55,126 --> 00:22:57,126
好让大卫和我及早体验新家的感觉
To make David and me feel at home.

481
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:59,126
就差一头熊在树丛里拉一坨屎了
All we need now is a bear to shit in the woods.

482
00:22:59,126 --> 00:23:00,626
我可以邀请「人孔盖」的 (双关)
I could ask Big Hairy Al

483
00:23:00,626 --> 00:23:02,136
大支毛男艾尔过来
who works at the manhole to come over.

484
00:23:02,136 --> 00:23:03,136
他最爱玩粪便了
He's into scat.

485
00:23:03,136 --> 00:23:04,136
哦  老天
Eww, jesus.

486
00:23:04,136 --> 00:23:06,136
快捂住耳朵  小宝贝
Cover your ears, sweetheart,

487
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:08,136
艾美特阿姨真恶心
Your aunty Em is being gross.

488
00:23:09,636 --> 00:23:11,146
怎麽了
What?

489
00:23:11,146 --> 00:23:12,646
你说要穿法兰绒格纹
You said wear flannel.

490
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:19,146
请允许我说  你们两从来没有看起来这麽
May I say, you two have never looked more...

491
00:23:19,646 --> 00:23:20,646
男人婆过
butch.

492
00:23:20,646 --> 00:23:22,656
你不也是
Well, neither have you.

493
00:23:22,656 --> 00:23:23,656
法兰绒格纹
Flannel.

494
00:23:25,156 --> 00:23:27,156
不就是拉子的内衣吗
Isn't that lesbian lingerie?

495
00:23:28,656 --> 00:23:30,656
插根阴茎更好  怎麽样
Stick a dick in it, would you?

496
00:23:30,656 --> 00:23:33,166
太好笑了
I think that's funny.

497
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:34,166
布莱恩在哪
Where's Brian?

498
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:37,166
他总是姗姗来迟
He's always fashionably late.

499
00:24:04,196 --> 00:24:05,696
你和他谈过没
Have you talked to him yet?

500
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,196
这松饼有放白脱牛奶吗？
Are these buttermilk?

501
00:24:12,206 --> 00:24:13,206
没
No.

502
00:24:15,206 --> 00:24:16,206
作为今晚的女主人
Well, may I suggest,

503
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:19,206
我有个提议
as your hostess for the evening

504
00:24:19,206 --> 00:24:20,206
快去和他谈谈
That you do so?

505
00:24:22,716 --> 00:24:24,716
这是惜别会  不是调解会
It's a goodbye party, not an intervention.

506
00:24:25,216 --> 00:24:28,216
但是越早说再见越好
Then the sooner you say goodbye, the better.

507
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:30,216
不用现在就和我告别
You don't have to say goodbye to me right now.

508
00:24:30,216 --> 00:24:31,726
我明天才走
I'm not leaving till tomorrow.

509
00:24:31,726 --> 00:24:33,726
我们不是在说你  宝贝
We weren't talking about you, sweetie.

510
00:24:35,726 --> 00:24:37,226
你都收拾好了吗
So, you all packed?

511
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:39,226
是啊  现在我所有的东西都装上了货车
Yeah, my entire life is on a moving van

512
00:24:39,226 --> 00:24:40,726
向波特兰开去了
headed to Ｐortland.

513
00:24:40,726 --> 00:24:43,736
你不是想退缩了吧？
You aren't getting cold feet, are you?

514
00:24:43,736 --> 00:24:44,906
自从我住这儿以後
I haven't had cold feet

515
00:24:44,906 --> 00:24:47,236
脚从来没冷过　("脚冷" 也意指退缩)
since I lived here.

516
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:48,236
还记得非得猛敲暖气管
Remember banging on the pipes

517
00:24:48,736 --> 00:24:50,736
房东才会打开暖气吗
so the landlord would turn on some heat?

518
00:24:51,246 --> 00:24:52,746
总好过去敲房东 (bang也指上了房东)
It's better than banging the landlord.

519
00:24:52,746 --> 00:24:54,246
这
Well...

520
00:25:01,256 --> 00:25:02,256
亲爱的
Well, honey...

521
00:25:03,756 --> 00:25:06,756
如果你什麽时候想回来了  只要
You ever want to come home, you just, um...

522
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:08,756
只要敲鞋跟三下就可以了
you just click your heels three times.

523
00:25:15,766 --> 00:25:17,766
我觉得我最想念的人一定会是你  稻草人
I guess I'll miss you most of all, Scarecrow.

524
00:25:39,786 --> 00:25:41,796
可怜的家伙
Poor guys.

525
00:25:41,796 --> 00:25:42,796
他们没事吧
Are they gonna be all right?

526
00:25:44,296 --> 00:25:45,796
嗯  他们会没事的
Yeah, they'll be fine.

527
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:48,296
你呢
What about you?

528
00:25:48,796 --> 00:25:50,796
天啊  迈克  你只是去波特兰
For chrissakes, Michael, you're only going to Portland,

529
00:25:50,796 --> 00:25:52,306
又不是要上月球
not to the moon.

530
00:25:52,806 --> 00:25:53,806
况且还有电话和飞机
They got planes and phones

531
00:25:53,806 --> 00:25:55,806
可以随时往返呢
that go both ways, honey.

532
00:25:55,806 --> 00:25:58,306
你和维克叔叔随时可以过来玩
And you and uncle vic can come and visit any time you want.

533
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,806
说话要算数哦
We may take you up on that.

534
00:26:01,316 --> 00:26:03,316
但就像我说的那样  这没什麽大不了的
But like I said, it's no big deal.

535
00:26:04,316 --> 00:26:05,816
我一直都是这麽说的  对吧维克
Isn't that what I've been saying, Vic?

536
00:26:05,816 --> 00:26:07,316
她确实一直都这麽说
She's been saying that.

537
00:26:08,816 --> 00:26:10,316
来  抱我一下  没什麽大不了的
So give me a hug, and that'll be that.

538
00:26:23,836 --> 00:26:25,836
妈
Ma?

539
00:26:25,836 --> 00:26:27,336
你不打算放开我了吗
Are you going to let me go?

540
00:26:29,336 --> 00:26:32,846
我很想放开你  但没办法
I'd like to sweetheart, but I can't.

541
00:26:33,846 --> 00:26:35,346
什麽叫没办法
What do you mean, you can't?

542
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:38,346
我的手臂动弹不了了
My arms won't move.

543
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,846
妈  你快要把我闷死了
Ma, you're suffocating me.

544
00:26:40,346 --> 00:26:41,856
我不是在说笑
I'm not fuckin' kidding.

545
00:26:41,856 --> 00:26:43,856
大卫  维克叔叔
David, uncle Vic?

546
00:26:43,856 --> 00:26:44,856
好了  放开吧
Oh, okay, okay.

547
00:26:45,356 --> 00:26:47,356
我们一起来把她拉开  数到三
Come on, let's give her a pull. On three...

548
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:19,386
-过来  　　　-我可没有乱动你房间里的东西
- Come here. -I didn't touch anything in your room.

549
00:27:19,386 --> 00:27:20,386
我不是要说这个
That's not what I was going to say.

550
00:27:20,386 --> 00:27:22,396
听着  我要你帮我个忙
Look, I need you to do me a favour.

551
00:27:22,396 --> 00:27:24,896
什麽  要我就此消失吗
What, disappear?

552
00:27:24,896 --> 00:27:28,396
我早就不抱这种愿望了
I gave up all hope of that happening a long time ago.

553
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,896
我希望我不在的日子你可以帮我照顾我妈
I need you to take care of my mom while I'm away.

554
00:27:30,896 --> 00:27:32,906
不要让她工作太劳累  还有
You know, make sure she doesn't work too hard, and...

555
00:27:33,406 --> 00:27:35,406
帮她做做家务
and help her around the house,

556
00:27:35,406 --> 00:27:37,406
倒倒垃圾什麽的
and... and take out the trash

557
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:39,906
如果你看见她感到寂寞
And if you see that she is lonely,

558
00:27:39,906 --> 00:27:42,916
就过去陪她坐一会儿
just sit with her a while

559
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:44,916
让她把心里想说的话说出来
and let her talk.

560
00:27:44,916 --> 00:27:46,916
这些话可能你已经听过很多遍了
Even if you've heard it before.

561
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:50,916
但有时候她只是需要一个忠实的听众
Because sometimes she just needs to know that someone is listening

562
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:51,926
我一定做到
I promise.

563
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:08,436
我爱你的朋友们
I love your friends.

564
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:11,446
他们就像家人一样
They are like family.

565
00:28:11,446 --> 00:28:13,446
不是「像」  他们就是
Not "like"; they are.

566
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:17,946
因为我们信任彼此
It's because we trust each other.

567
00:28:21,456 --> 00:28:23,456
你不信任我吗
You don't trust me?

568
00:28:23,456 --> 00:28:24,956
有什麽让我无法信任的吗
Do I have reason not to?

569
00:28:29,956 --> 00:28:31,466
好吧  听着  我们还是
All right, look, let's not pretend there isn't a moose

570
00:28:31,966 --> 00:28:33,966
不要再粉饰太平了
in the middle of the room, okay?

571
00:28:33,966 --> 00:28:35,966
我知道你又嗑药了
I know you're using again.

572
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:37,966
在我买给你的那件西装口袋里
I found one of your little "favours"

573
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:38,966
我发现了你的一瓶「小玩意儿」
in the pocket of the suit I bought you.

574
00:28:39,466 --> 00:28:40,466
我们说好要相互信任的
Huh, talk about trust.

575
00:28:40,466 --> 00:28:43,976
我没要找什麽  是它自己掉出来的
I wasn't looking for it. okay, it just fell out.

576
00:28:43,976 --> 00:28:45,976
你信也好不信也好  我都不在乎
You can believe me or not, I really don't care.

577
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:48,476
我一直想假装没看到
Since then, I've been trying to pretend I didn't see it.

578
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:49,976
只是  我做不到
Only, I can't.

579
00:28:49,976 --> 00:28:51,486
我不能看着你就这样把自己毁了
Not when I see you destroying your life.

580
00:28:51,486 --> 00:28:54,486
我恐怕是一再沉沦  一再让你失望了
I was afraid of disappointing you, of failing again.

581
00:28:54,486 --> 00:28:56,486
的确
Well, you have.

582
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:59,486
我不能和一个毒虫过活
And I can't live with an addict.

583
00:28:59,486 --> 00:29:01,996
我也不能和一个毒虫做爱
And I can't make love to an addict.

584
00:29:02,996 --> 00:29:04,496
我一想到
And it sickens me

585
00:29:04,996 --> 00:29:05,996
你对你自己所做的一切就作呕
to think about what you're doing to a person

586
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:07,496
我这麽关心你  在乎你
I happen to care a whole lot about

587
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,996
你却这样糟蹋自己
who obviously cares so little about himself.

588
00:29:09,996 --> 00:29:12,506
所以我别无选择
So I have no choice...

589
00:29:12,506 --> 00:29:14,006
只能跟你分手了
Except to say goodbye.

590
00:29:14,006 --> 00:29:16,006
我也不想这样的
I don't wanna be like this!

591
00:29:26,016 --> 00:29:28,516
那就去戒毒所
Then check yourself into rehab.

592
00:30:00,046 --> 00:30:02,556
要鹿肉乾吗
Hm. uh, Moose Jerky?

593
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:09,056
离别  比我想得要艰难多了
It's harder than I thought... saying goodbye.

594
00:30:09,056 --> 00:30:11,566
我们凌晨就走还真是一件好事
It's a good thing we're leaving first thing in the morning.

595
00:30:15,066 --> 00:30:17,566
实际上  我把机票改到明天晚上了
Actually, I changed the reservation for tomorrow night.

596
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:18,566
什麽
What?

597
00:30:19,566 --> 00:30:21,576
我说我把机票改到明天晚上了
I said I changed the reservation till tomorr...

598
00:30:22,076 --> 00:30:23,076
你为什麽没有告诉我
Why didn't you tell me?

599
00:30:24,576 --> 00:30:26,076
这很重要吗
Well, does it matter?

600
00:30:26,076 --> 00:30:27,576
不重要才怪
Obviously not.

601
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,576
迈克  这只是一点小变动
Well, Michael, it's just a little change of plan.

602
00:30:30,076 --> 00:30:31,586
我还有一些事情没有交代清楚
I've just got a few things I gotta clear up...

603
00:30:31,586 --> 00:30:32,586
我可以帮你完成啊
Which I could've helped you with,

604
00:30:32,586 --> 00:30:34,586
可是  我每次提出要帮你  你都拒绝
Except... every time I offer, you refuse.

605
00:30:34,586 --> 00:30:37,086
你每次都要亲自动手
You have to do everything yourself.

606
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:38,086
我只是觉得
I just thought...

607
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,086
不 你只是觉得我没有处理事情的能力
No, you just thought I couldn't handle it.

608
00:30:40,086 --> 00:30:42,096
我他妈的连装个纱门都不会
That I can't hang a fucking screen door.

609
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:48,096
你这是怎麽了
What the fuck is wrong with you?

610
00:30:51,096 --> 00:30:53,606
你觉得我只会跟在你的身後
You just think I'm going to go along,

611
00:30:53,606 --> 00:30:55,606
照你说的做
do whatever you want,

612
00:30:55,606 --> 00:30:58,106
甚至连时间和方式也要受你限制
on your terms and your time.

613
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:01,106
就像个孩子或  模范老婆
Like a child, or a... or a trophy wife.

614
00:31:01,616 --> 00:31:03,616
什麽事情都由你做主  而我只能在旁边附和
You just make all the decisions, and I'll say "yes, dear".

615
00:31:03,616 --> 00:31:06,116
只有我要放弃我生命中的所有
Only I'm the one giving up everything in my goddamn life.

616
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:08,076
包括我的家人  我的朋友
My family, my friends,

617
00:31:08,076 --> 00:31:09,116
我的工作去跟你在一起
my job to be with you.

618
00:31:10,616 --> 00:31:12,626
我不得不这麽怀疑
And I have to wonder,

619
00:31:12,626 --> 00:31:14,626
如果换作是你
that if the situation was reversed,

620
00:31:14,626 --> 00:31:16,626
你也会为我做同样的事情吗
would you have done the same for me?

621
00:31:21,636 --> 00:31:23,136
我想我已经知道答案了
Well, I guess that's an answer

622
00:32:39,706 --> 00:32:41,206
妈的
Fuck you!

623
00:32:41,716 --> 00:32:42,716
妈的
Fuck you!

624
00:32:44,716 --> 00:32:46,216
混蛋
Asshole!

625
00:32:46,216 --> 00:32:48,716
你他妈的在干什麽
What the fuck were you doing?

626
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,216
你他妈的又在干什麽呢
What the fuck are you doing?

627
00:32:50,216 --> 00:32:53,226
我来看看你为什麽没有参加我的告别派对
I came here to see why you didn't come to my farewell party.

628
00:32:54,226 --> 00:32:56,226
什麽派对
What party?

629
00:32:56,226 --> 00:32:57,226
别他妈给我装蒜了
You know goddamn well.

630
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:59,226
除了你大家都去了
Everybody was there but you.

631
00:32:59,226 --> 00:33:03,236
想起来了  大卫和迈克的法兰绒格纹衬衫告别会
Oh, right, David and Michael's "farewell in flannel".

632
00:33:07,236 --> 00:33:09,736
我忙着为自己进行庆祝呢
Well, I've been having a little celebration of my own

633
00:33:09,736 --> 00:33:11,746
纪念我华丽的三十岁
in honour of my big three-O.

634
00:33:11,746 --> 00:33:13,246
就用这玩意儿吗
With this?

635
00:33:13,246 --> 00:33:15,746
正是  送给自己一个特别的礼物
Yeah, to give myself a very special gift.

636
00:33:15,746 --> 00:33:16,746
什麽特别？
Like what?

637
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:20,246
就是给我自已这辈子最棒的高潮
Like the greatest fucking orgasm of my life.

638
00:33:20,246 --> 00:33:22,756
我看是你这辈子最後的高潮吧
Try the last fucking orgasm of your life.

639
00:33:22,756 --> 00:33:24,256
你可能会弄死自己的
You could kill yourself.

640
00:33:24,756 --> 00:33:26,756
这绝不是最糟糕的事
Well, that wouldn't be the worst thing that could happen.

641
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:30,256
带着一身荣光离去
To go out in a blaze of glory,

642
00:33:30,256 --> 00:33:32,766
就像柯特·科本（摇滚歌手  27岁自杀）
Like Cobain...

643
00:33:32,766 --> 00:33:34,766
詹姆斯·迪恩（影星  24岁死於车祸）
James Dean...

644
00:33:34,766 --> 00:33:35,766
吉米·亨德里克斯（吉他大师  28死亡）
Hendrix.

645
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:39,766
他们都是传奇
They're all legends.

646
00:33:39,766 --> 00:33:41,776
他们将永远年轻
They'll always be young.

647
00:33:41,776 --> 00:33:43,776
永远风华正茂
And they'll always be beautiful.

648
00:33:43,776 --> 00:33:45,776
他们也永远是死人了
And they'll always be dead.

649
00:33:46,276 --> 00:33:50,276
「如果害怕冒险  生命还有什麽意义呢」
"life not worth living if you not take risk."

650
00:33:50,276 --> 00:33:51,786
你不能这麽做
You're not going through with it.

651
00:33:52,286 --> 00:33:55,786
如果我想体验窒息式性爱的快感
If I want to experience the joys of scarfing,

652
00:33:56,286 --> 00:33:57,786
那又他妈的关你什麽事
what the hell business is it of yours?

653
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:58,686
这当然关我的事了
It's my business

654
00:33:58,686 --> 00:34:00,286
因为当该死的清洁女工
'cause I'm the one who'll get the call

655
00:34:00,286 --> 00:34:01,796
发现你勃起的屍体挂在梁上
that the god- damn cleaning lady's found you

656
00:34:01,796 --> 00:34:04,796
警察打电话找的人肯定是我
hanging from the rafters with a fucking boner.

657
00:34:04,796 --> 00:34:07,296
妈的  迈克
Ah... fuck you, Michael.

658
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:09,796
去你的
Fuck you.

659
00:34:09,796 --> 00:34:13,306
你为什麽非要破坏一切呢
Why do you always have to ruin everything?

660
00:34:13,306 --> 00:34:16,306
破坏  我这是在救你的命
Ruin? I'm saving you! ah?

661
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:18,806
就像托比·哈珀救了星际队长一样
Just like Toby Harper saved captain Astro

662
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,806
在《星际队长》第231期
in issue 231 of Astro comics.

663
00:34:20,806 --> 00:34:22,776
当时星际队长认为自己
When captain astro thought that

664
00:34:22,786 --> 00:34:24,816
失去了所有的超能力
he'd lost all of his super power

665
00:34:24,816 --> 00:34:27,816
天啊  你太可悲了
God, you are so pathetic.

666
00:34:29,316 --> 00:34:32,326
不  可悲的是你
No, you are!

667
00:34:32,326 --> 00:34:34,826
你难道不知道你还是魅力十足吗？
Don't you know that you still have your powers?

668
00:34:35,326 --> 00:34:36,326
你全部的魅力
All your powers.

669
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:37,826
你永远都不会失去的
And you always will.

670
00:34:39,326 --> 00:34:41,326
不管你是18岁还是30岁
Whether you're 18 or you're 30,

671
00:34:41,326 --> 00:34:44,336
50岁  甚至100岁
or you're 50, or you're 100.

672
00:34:44,336 --> 00:34:45,836
你将永远保持年轻
You will always be young

673
00:34:45,836 --> 00:34:47,836
也将永远风华绝代
And you will always be beautiful.

674
00:34:49,836 --> 00:34:51,846
你可是他妈的「布莱恩·肯尼」啊
You're Brian Kinney, for fuck's sake!

675
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,356
这儿的工作人员好像很不错
Well, the staff seems very nice.

676
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:08,856
都很热心
They're really helpful.

677
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,356
确实
They do.

678
00:35:10,856 --> 00:35:11,866
他们说他们可以随时满足你的要求
They said you can get anything you want, anytime.

679
00:35:11,866 --> 00:35:14,866
-全天都有零食供应的  　　　　　　　　　-不错啊
- You know, they got snacks all day... - That's good.

680
00:35:14,866 --> 00:35:17,366
如果你有什麽需要的话  只要
Yeah. And if you need anything, you just, um...

681
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:19,366
我会的
I... I will.

682
00:35:19,866 --> 00:35:21,876
我想你知道
Look, I-I... I want you to know

683
00:35:21,876 --> 00:35:22,876
我有多开心
how happy...

684
00:35:23,376 --> 00:35:25,376
说「开心」不太恰当
Well... happy's not the right word.

685
00:35:25,876 --> 00:35:30,376
不是开心  是感激
Not happy, but uh... grateful

686
00:35:30,376 --> 00:35:31,886
和宽慰
and relieved

687
00:35:31,886 --> 00:35:33,886
你能这麽做
I am that you're doing this.

688
00:35:33,886 --> 00:35:35,886
这都是为了我们  对吧
Well, it's for us, right?

689
00:35:35,886 --> 00:35:36,886
对
Right.

690
00:35:50,896 --> 00:35:51,906
那麽
So...

691
00:35:52,906 --> 00:35:54,906
-我们晚上见  　　　　　　-晚上见
- I'll see you tonight?  - Tonight.

692
00:35:56,906 --> 00:35:58,906
对了  还有一件事
Oh, one more thing before I forget...

693
00:36:00,406 --> 00:36:02,916
我想你可能会想听这个
Huh, thought you might like to listen to that.

694
00:36:02,916 --> 00:36:04,916
「茶花女」
"La traviata".

695
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:06,416
-你最爱的歌剧  　　　　　-是啊  这个是
- Your favourite opera.  - Yeah, it's...

696
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:09,416
我唯一知道的歌剧
the only opera that... I know.

697
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:12,426
只是
Except...

698
00:36:13,926 --> 00:36:15,926
你不是说结尾的时候他们又在一起了
you said at the end they get back together

699
00:36:16,426 --> 00:36:17,926
而且唱了很多华美的合唱
and sing many glorious duets.

700
00:36:19,926 --> 00:36:20,926
这个应该在续集里吧
Guess that's the sequel.

701
00:36:22,936 --> 00:36:23,936
茶花女2
"Traviata 2".

702
00:36:36,946 --> 00:36:38,446
考虑到你的感受
Considering how you feel,

703
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:41,446
我觉得你不要去比较好
I think it's probably a good idea that you not go.

704
00:36:41,956 --> 00:36:43,456
你觉得比较好
You think it's a good idea.

705
00:36:43,456 --> 00:36:45,456
老天  迈克  你还想让我说什麽
For Chris' sakes, Michael, what do you want me to say?

706
00:36:45,456 --> 00:36:47,456
说「我们都觉得」  如果你偶尔这样说
"We think." You know, if you used the word occasionally

707
00:36:47,456 --> 00:36:48,956
你可能已经习惯了
you might actually get used to it.

708
00:36:49,456 --> 00:36:51,456
很明显是你自己觉得这主意不太好的
You're the one who's obviously decided it's not a good idea.

709
00:36:51,456 --> 00:36:53,466
只是这次不是纱门
Only this time it's not about screen doors

710
00:36:53,466 --> 00:36:55,466
也不是改航班  这次是布莱恩
or changing flights. This time it's about Brian.

711
00:36:55,466 --> 00:36:56,966
如果你当初知道他不走的话
If you knew he wasn't leaving,

712
00:36:56,966 --> 00:36:58,466
你绝对不会答应和我一起去的
you would've never agreed to go.

713
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,466
不是的  大卫
No, David.

714
00:37:00,466 --> 00:37:02,976
你应该很高兴知道  这次和他无关
You'll be happy to know, this time it's not about him.

715
00:37:02,976 --> 00:37:04,476
是你
It's about you.

716
00:37:06,976 --> 00:37:08,476
车马上就要来了
The car'll be here any minute.

717
00:37:12,486 --> 00:37:14,486
我可以送你去机场的
I can take you to the airport.

718
00:37:14,486 --> 00:37:16,486
我知道  不过最好不要
I know you can, but I'd rather you didn't.

719
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:19,486
很好  你说了算
Okay, fine. Have it your way.

720
00:37:21,486 --> 00:37:22,996
我说了算
The way I always do?

721
00:37:23,496 --> 00:37:24,996
不是那样的
That's not what I was going to say.

722
00:37:26,496 --> 00:37:27,996
抱歉
I'm sorry.

723
00:37:31,496 --> 00:37:33,006
我告诉过你多少次了
How many times have I told you,

724
00:37:33,006 --> 00:37:36,006
你不需要一直道歉的  迈克
You don't have to keep apologizing, Michael?

725
00:37:36,006 --> 00:37:37,506
我知道  可是
I know I don't, but...

726
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:39,006
另外
Aside from that...

727
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:45,016
应该是我要道歉的
I'm the one that should be apologizing to you.

728
00:37:45,016 --> 00:37:47,016
很抱歉我没有考虑到你的感受
I'm sorry I disregarded your feelings,

729
00:37:47,016 --> 00:37:48,516
很抱歉我自作主张
that I didn't include you in the decisions,

730
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,016
想让你和我一起走  还有  不
that I expected you to come, and, no...

731
00:37:53,026 --> 00:37:55,526
我不确定我能做到你所做的
I'm not sure that I could do the same.

732
00:38:00,526 --> 00:38:02,536
很感谢你的道歉  不过
Well, I appreciate that, but that's...

733
00:38:02,536 --> 00:38:04,536
我要说的不是这个
That's not what I was going to say.

734
00:38:06,036 --> 00:38:07,036
我的人生怎麽过
It's not up to you

735
00:38:07,036 --> 00:38:09,036
不该是你来决定
to decide what I should do with my life.

736
00:38:09,536 --> 00:38:10,536
是我自己该决定
That's up to me.

737
00:38:10,536 --> 00:38:13,546
如果我不自己决定  那就是我的错
And if I didn't do it, then it's my fault.

738
00:38:15,046 --> 00:38:16,046
而且
And...

739
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:19,546
也许下一次我应该
maybe next time I should just...

740
00:38:19,546 --> 00:38:21,656
先想清楚
I should think things through

741
00:38:21,656 --> 00:38:24,056
再答应
more clearly befond I say yes.

742
00:38:27,556 --> 00:38:29,556
我希望你能改变主意
Well, I hope you'll decide to change your mind.

743
00:38:32,066 --> 00:38:33,566
如果你想来的话
And if you do...

744
00:38:36,566 --> 00:38:37,566
我会等你
I'll be waiting.

745
00:38:40,566 --> 00:38:42,576
这一次
And this time,

746
00:38:42,576 --> 00:38:44,576
轮到你来决定了
On your time... and your terms.

747
00:39:02,096 --> 00:39:03,096
各位  请注意
Attention, everyone.

748
00:39:05,096 --> 00:39:06,596

749
00:39:06,596 --> 00:39:08,596
穿着短版T恤和迷彩裤的
in the midriff-t and fatigues

750
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,596
可爱小鬼吗

751
00:39:10,596 --> 00:39:14,606
那麽  请看看现在是谁走下来了
Well, just take a look at who is coming down.

752
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:21,606

Holy shit, sunshine!

753
00:39:22,116 --> 00:39:23,116
谁能想到呢
Well, what do ya know?

754
00:39:23,616 --> 00:39:24,616
小嫩鸡现在变成
The little chicken's become

00:39:24,616 --> 00:39:26,116
雄赳赳气昂昂的大公鸡了 (cock暗指阴茎)
cock-of-the-walk.

756

亲爱的  你看上去  很美
Sweetheart, you look... beautiful.

757
00:39:30,116 --> 00:39:32,126
老天  连我都想追你了
Jesus, I could go for you myself.

758
00:39:32,626 --> 00:39:34,626
那你得先过了我这关
If I don't beat you to him.

759
00:40:23,676 --> 00:40:25,676
真不敢相信你把签名本都带来了
I can't believe you brought your autograph book with you.

760
00:40:25,676 --> 00:40:28,676
你不会料到在戒毒所可能遇见谁
Well, you never know who you might see in rehab.

It's a voluntary commitment, we can't force people to stay.

挤满了小鬼头的地方吗
in a room full of 18-year-olds.

775
