Didn't you used to be on the telly?

4
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,760
- Back in the mists of time, yeah.
- Yeah, what was it called?

5
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,400
<i>Largin' It,</i> or something?

6
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,640
Yep, that was one of them. Any coffee?

7
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,520
You used to go out with Suki Meadows.

8
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,000
Uh, yeah, just a double espresso.

9
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,960
I mean, she's everywhere these days,
isn't she?

10
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,560
What was it like, then?
Going out with her?

11
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,680
Uh, quite loud, sometimes. But fun.

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,600
What happened to you, then, mate?

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,480
Dunno. Still trying to work that one out.

14
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,960
Cool. Can you get that for me?

15
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,400

Hello. What are you doing here?

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,440
I wanted to catch you
in a hairnet, but I see I'm too late.

22
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,840
No, you gotta get here before 6:00 a.m.
for that privilege.

23
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,440
Got a meeting round the corner,
so I thought I'd pop in.

24
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,360
Marketing. Apparently,
it's not enough to write a book.

25
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,800
People have to buy it as well.

26
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,200
Any coffee? I've... I've got better.

27
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,760
No. No, thanks.

28
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,160
Well, you've gotta get something.

29
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,960
Otherwise, I'll eject you
from the premises.

30
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,840
Where's Callum?

31
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,880
Oh, he only descends to the shop floor
on special occasions.

32
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,720
So, how is it?

33
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,400
Yeah. I mean, like, you know,
I'm the oldest person here.

34
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,160
People born in the '80s
are telling me what to do,

35
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,920
but it's... it's interesting, you know.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,360
- Only complaint is the music.
- What's wrong with it?

37
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,320
Oh, same four tracks
from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.,

38
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,200
day in, day out. It's agony.

39
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,160
Aside from that, yeah, it's really good.

40
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,600
And it's good with Callum.

41
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,360
I mean, he likes me to be grateful,
and I am, so that's all right.

42
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,120
And just as long as I express that
once a day or once an hour.

43
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,840
Oh.

44
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,640
Bollocks.

45
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,880
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

46
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,640
We've got a VIP guest.

47
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,920
How are you, Judy Blume?

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,880
And what bollocks
has this one been talking?

49
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,880
Oh, he was just saying he's loving it.

50
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,240
Yeah. He's particularly enjoying
the playlist.

51
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,440
It's shite, isn't it?

52
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,360
But it does the job.
Get them in, get them out.

53
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,720
On which, Topsy and Tim,
can you have your playdate later?

54
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,200
Well, it's just, I need your help.

Hello.

61
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,560
Hello, Jazz.

62
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,520
What kind of day have you had?

63
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,560
I wish you wouldn't call her that.
She is Jasmine.

64
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,720
She's not Jazz, Jazzy,
Jazzmatazz, which is just awful, Dexter.

65
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,080
Jazz Mayhew.

66
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,320
It sounds like some saxophonist
in some lesbian funk band. Jazz.

67
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,240
Well, if you're gonna name her Jasmine,
she's going to get called Jazz.

68
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,680
I didn't name her. <i>We</i> named her.

69
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,800
It's gonna happen.
I'm just saying I don't like it.

70
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,800
Fine. I'll change the way
I talk to my daughter.

71
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,360
Good. I'd like that.

72
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,120
Sorry.

73
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,320
It's just been an awful day.

74
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,560
I just can't bear it
anymore, Dexter.

75
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,920
It's the noise and the dust.

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,240
You... You said you wanted to renovate.

77
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,240
Is that a helpful comment right now?

78
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,640
Noise and dust, all day.

79
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,920
And no sleep, ever. She won't nap.

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,440
She's awake half the night,
and I'm so shattered.

81
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,200
And it's making me feel awful.

82
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,120
And I swear, if I have to walk around
that bloody park again, I'm gonna scream.

83
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,240
I... I... I walk around the lake,
and then, oh, around the lake,

84
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,160
and then over to the swings,
and then around the lake again.

85
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,280
Mommy says I should
just go there for a few weeks

86
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,280
and just get some R&R.

87
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,840
Well then, why don't you?

88
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,080
Because to be honest,

89
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,760
I can't bear the questions.

90
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,600
"What's he doing?
What's the long-term plan?"

91
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,640
"Do you need more money?"

92
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,120
Working's better than not working, surely?

93
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,840
Don't be defensive, Dexter.

94
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,120
Then why do you
have to tell them anything?

95
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,080
Let alone everything.

96
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,760
We're a close family.

97
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,920
They can tell.

98
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,160
Tell what?

99
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,360
I'm just gonna cancel tonight.

100
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,040
No, don't cancel. You've been
looking forward to it for weeks.

101
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,760
Well, I'm not really in the mood,
to be honest. A hen night.

102
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,440
- I'm a bit old for hen nights.
- That's rubbish.

103
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,400
- And I worry.
- About what?

104
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,240
- Leaving us on our own?
- Not worry, exactly.

105
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,520
Well,
I'm 33 years old, Sylvie.

106
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,840
I've been in a house by myself before.

107
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,120
Anyway, I won't be alone,

108
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,600
because I'll have Jazz here
to look after me.

109
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,600
We'll be fine, won't we, Jazz?

110
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,280
<i>Mine.</i> Jas... Jasmine.

111
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,120
So put her down around seven, okay?

112
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,880
- Fine.
- There's plenty of formula.

113
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,120
And I've pureed the veggies.
They're in the fridge.

114
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,440
In the fridge, yeah.

115
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,440
And if she won't take that,
there's ready-made jars in the cupboard,

116
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,440
but they are only for emergencies, okay?

117
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,960
Can I give her crisps?

118
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,160
I can give her crisps, can't I?
Just brush off the salt.

119
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,640
Oh, for God's sake, Dexter.

120
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,160
Ooh.

121
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,560
You look amazing, by the way.

122
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,840
Don't look, Jasmine.

123
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,120
Stop it, Dex.

124
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,520
That's my taxi.

125
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,680
Um, look, if there's an emergency,
then call my mobile.

126
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,400
Okay?

127
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,000
"Mama."

128
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,720
"Where you going, Mama?
Don't leave me with this clown."

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,880
And there's certainly
no evidence of any dinner.

158
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,880
Come over.

159
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,760
No. No more babies.

160
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,480
I mean, Jazz is a very nice example
of one, but no.

161
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,960
I need intelligent, adult conversation,
and something to eat.

162
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,880
- And I need a kebab.
- Kebab?

163
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,680
Ah, can you get one for me too? Pop it
on the District line with a little note.

164
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,400
Chicken or lamb?

165
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,600
- Lamb.
- Lamb.

166
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,560
Okay. I gotta go, Dex.
I will call you tomorrow. Bye.

167
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,720
Bye, Em.

168
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,800
- Tills.
- Mixed doner with chips and salad.

169
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,880
No onion.

170
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,280
- No onion for me too, please.
- No onion.

171
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,360
Oh, and can you get some chili sauce?
And some ice cream. It's good for my milk.

172
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,040
Okay. Yeah.

173
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,800
Uh, Gray?

174
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,920
Yes?

175
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,920
Can't take him to the kebab shop.

176
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,680
No.

177
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,800
Thank you.

178
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,320
Hey. Aww.

179
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,440
- Here you go.
- Hmm?

180
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,360
Oh God.

181
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,240
Oh.

182
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,440
Aww!

183
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,240
I feel nothing.

184
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,880
- Sniff his head.
- What? No.

185
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,560
Sniff his head. I demand it.

186
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,840
- It's like the back of a watch strap.
- Yeah.

187
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,160
- Oh, did I say garlic mayo?
- Uh, no.

188
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,360
Oh, for God...

189
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,400
- Where's my phone?
- Oh, poor Graham.

190
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,200
Oh, poor Graham.

191
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,800
Well, I expelled that child from my body
while he sat there reading the NME.

192
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,880
Hello.

193
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:55,080
I don't know what to say to you,
but you are quite nice.

194
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,080
Aww!

195
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,160
Come on.

196
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,840
Aww.

Hello.

208
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,320
What's that?

209
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,880
Oh, that is...

210
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,280
Uh, it's just some music.

211
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,840
Jasmine and I were having a little party.

212
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,200
She's still awake?

213
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,000
She... She wasn't, but, uh...

214
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,520
she is now.

215
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,160
What have you been up to?

216
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,240
<i>Nothing much.</i>

217
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,320
Just, you know,
hanging out, watching telly.

218
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,480
<i>How about you? Uh... having fun?</i>

219
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,480
It's okay.

220
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,200
Everyone's off their faces, of course.

221
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,440
Except you.

222
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,480
I'm too exhausted to get drunk.

223
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,480
Where are you? It's very quiet.

224
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,400
I'm in my hotel room.

225
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,560
<i>I'm just going to have a lie down
and then go back for the next wave.</i>

226
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,320
How's Jasmine?

227
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,800
Jasmine is smiling,
aren't you, sweetheart?

228
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,120
Look, it's Mommy on the phone.

229
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,120
<i>Hello, Jasmine. Can you hear me?</i>

230
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,520
It's Mommy.

231
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,440
<i>Hello.</i>

232
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,800
Go on. Say something.

233
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,720
Uh, it's me again.

234
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,760
<i>Obviously.</i>

235
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,040
But you're managing.

236
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,640
Of course.

237
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,440
Did you ever doubt me?

238
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,560
Well, you should, um...

239
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,640
just... get back to your party.

240
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,200
I probably should.

241
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,960
Good night.

242
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,160
Night, Dexter.

243
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,840
Wait, uh, Sylvie? Sylvie?

244
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,640
Mm-hmm?

245
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,160
Um...

246
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,760
I just want to say

247
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,280
I'm working on it.

248
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,200
- On what?
<i>- All of it.</i>

249
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,680
The... The whole
husband-father-provider thing.

250
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,760
I'm... I'm working on it.

251
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,120
- Dexter.
<i>- I am.</i>

252
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,480
And, uh... the house will get built,

253
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,800
and Jasmine will sleep.

254
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,720
And... And it'll all get better.

255
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,640
Okay? I promise, Sylv. It will.

256
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,320
We're just feeling our way.

257
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,440
That's all.

258
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,560
Mm.

259
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,880
Yeah.

260
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,720
Um...

261
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,440
<i>Okay, well,</i>

262
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,360
have a really nice time.

263
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,120
See you tomorrow.

264
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,960
I love you.

265
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,160
You too.

266
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,040
All okay?

267
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,520
Oh, you know. Not really.

268
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,400
I'm sure he's fine.

269
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,240
He sounded strange.
Maybe I should go home.

270
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,320
Come on.

271
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,240
He's fine.

272
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,760
Try and forget about it.

273
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,480
- Do you want another drink?
- No.

274
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,160
- Do you want to lie down?
- Callum!

275
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,640
For Chrissake, I've given the guy a job.
What else can I do?

276
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,480
Was that not enough?

277
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,800
Want me to take you home?
