我要在巴哈马最好的度假村订一间房
Book me into the best resort in the Bahamas.

6
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,780
巴哈马?  为什麽?  南海滩去腻了吗?
The Bahamas? Why? Is South Beach over?

7
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:49,110
不  自由航空要我去回收那里的市场
No. Liberty air is sending me there for a marketing retreat.

8
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,150
所以这次是公事  不是去花天酒地?
Oh, so this is all work, no play?

9
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,260
对  我会参考一下
Oh, right. I'll just crack open

10
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,950
斯巴达指南  给你订房 (同志旅游指南)
the Spartacus guide.

11

嘿  你有空吗?
Hey, you got a minute?

12
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,510
有  我们只是在谈我的出差计划
Yeah, we're just planning my trip.

13
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,820
你最好先别讨论那件事
Well, you better hold off on that.

14
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,390
我会派达伦·强生代替你去
I'm sending Darren Johnson instead.

15
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,700
我希望你休息一阵子
I need for you to go home.

16
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,670
我先出去
If you'll just excuse me for a minute.

17
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,310
只是暂时的
This is just until

18
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,080
直到那件性骚扰事件平息为止
this whole harassment thing is over.

19
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,690
你难道不晓得「有证据才能定罪」吗?
Whatever happened to "innocent until proven guilty?"

20
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,500
自由航空那些人都很保守
Look, the Liberty Air folks are conservative.

21
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,400
如果他们发现你这个行销总监
What would they think if they found out

22
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,140
牵上一件同志性丑闻  他们会怎麽想?
that their account exec was involved in a gay sex scandal?

23
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,890
你是说  如果异性的丑闻他们就不在乎?
You mean they wouldn't mind a straight one?

24
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,970
我已经跟法务部门谈了
I've also spoken with legal.

25
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,150
你得跟人力资源部的代表面谈一下
You're going to be seeing a, uh, a rep from human resources,

26
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,320
还会有一场...
and there's going to be a...

27
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,960
法院那边的外部调查
outside investigation, followed by a tribunal

28
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,320
会派调解委员过来
with a... an impartial mediator.

29
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,230
那我的死期是什麽时候?
When's the hanging?

30
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,590
如果我是你  我会去请一位上好的律师
If I were you, I'd get myself a good lawyer.

31
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,770
我告诉过你不要上他
I told you not to fuck him.

32
00:01:58,930 --> 00:01:59,670
你有注意到吗?
Have you ever noticed that when

33
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,100
你老妈没有来招呼我们的时候
your mom's not waiting on us,

34
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,470
我们餐点的份量大概少了三分之一
the portions shrink by approximately one third?

35
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,750
我点的不只是一根薯条  是一整份
I said "fries". Plural.

36
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,000
你有在听我说吗?
Are you even listening to me?

37
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,120
有  我不该上他的
Yeah, I shouldn't have fucked him.

38
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,710
这就像温斯福特跟我嘿咻
It's like Mr. Wertschafter fucking me.

39
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,010
他已经七十二岁了
Mr. Wertschafter's like 72!

40
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,770
你闭嘴行吗?  我想吃点东西
Do you mind? I was trying to eat.

41
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,480
你知道我是什麽意思
You know what I mean.

42
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,940
你不能"吃掉"你的属下
You don't prey on the help.

43
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,750
我没有"吃掉"他  是他先引诱我的
I didn't "prey" on him. He went after me.

44
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,480
我们去健身房吧
Let's go to the gym.

45
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,210
锻炼之後会感觉好点的
You'll feel better after you work out.

46
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,610
-你要来吗?    -我不去
-You coming?  -Oh, no.

47
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,670
我健身搭档不在  去健身房感觉不对
The gym isn't the same without my workout buddy.

48
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,010
我们可以做你的健身搭档
We'll be your workout buddies.

49
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,420
艾美特能让我放松一点
Emmett would let me get away with murder.

50
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,990
你们只会让我流汗紧张
You guys'll make me sweat.

51
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,610
那我们晚点在伍迪见喽?
So we'll see you at Woody's later on?

52
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,900
我的酒伴不在  伍迪也感觉不太一样
Ah, Woody's isn't the same without my beer buddy there,

53
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,770
他会对所有帅哥品头论足
Pointing out all the cute guys and...

54
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,840
还会洒我一身的酒
spilling drinks all over me.

55
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,270
我们也可以洒你一身酒
We'll spill drinks all over you.

56
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,870
你知道艾美特都是三分钟热度
You know Emmett can't commit to anything,

57
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,030
换男人  换护发产品
A guy, a new conditioner.

58
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,160
他会回来的  等着看吧
He'll get over this too. You'll see.

59
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,420
谢谢你的午餐
Thanks for lunch.

60
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,780
那天晚上
So, uh, there we were the other night,

61
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,190
吉姆和我坐在一起看比赛
Jim and I, sitting around watching the game.

62
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,120
我试着教他看懂美式足球
I'm... I'm trying to teach him football.

63
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,290
没错  你们受的了吗?
She is. Can you stand it?

64
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,700
我是不抱希望了
But I'm hopeless!

65
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,660
是啊  没错  但是那天
Yeah, you are. But anyway, so there I am,

66
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,130
我试着解释  什麽叫分数差
trying to explain point spreads yet again,

67
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,220
不知不觉中
When all of a sudden, uh,

68
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,250
我们互相注视着对方
We started to look into each other's eyes.

69
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,970
当我回神过来才发现  我们在接吻
The next thing I know, we were kissing.

70
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,960
唇舌纠缠  慾火焚身
With tongues and everything.

71
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,830
没错  你们受的了吗?
I know. Can you stand it?

72
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,260
现在  亲爱的  告诉他们
And now... Well, you tell them, honey.

73
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,460
我们订婚了
We're engaged.

74
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,610
你们受的了吗?  受的了吗?
Can you stand it? Can you stand it?

75
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,860
你们看到努力後的成果  多麽惊人吗?
Do you see the power of the work we're doing here?

76
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,810
别听信别人说什麽「这是不可能的」
Don't let anyone tell you that it isn't possible,

77
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,550
「你无药可救」
that you can't heal.

78
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,760
我想要听你们每个人
I want to hear success stories

79
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,950
你们成功的故事
from each and every one of you.

80
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,200
你们能做到的
You can do it.

81
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,510
你们一定行！  你们一定行！
You can do it. You can do it.

82
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,940
很振奋人心  是不是?
It's inspiring, isn't it?

83
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,940
看见别人改变了自己的命运
Seeing people change their lives.

84
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,730
是的  也给我们所有人希望
Yeah, it gives us all hope that...

85
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,420
相信有一天我们也能成功
One day we too can be a success story.

86
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,820
-我真希望我也能成功      -我也是
-God, I wish I was one.  -Oh, me too.

87
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,760
-我叫海瑟        -我是艾美特
-I'm Heather.    -Uh, Emmett.

88
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,800
-你好  -噢，好有力的握手
-Hi.   -Ow. Oh, nice, firm handshake.

89
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,230
对不起  我会改掉的
Sorry, I'm.... I'm working on that.

90
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,030
你是新来的吗?
Uh, so you're new here, huh?

91
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,890
对  大概来几个星期
Uh, yeah. A couple of weeks.

92
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,980
-你呢?  -六个月
- You?  - Uh, six months.

93
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,860
-有改善吗?  -还在努力中
- Has it helped?  - I'm getting there,

94
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,940
但是这是一场持久战
But it's a long road.

95
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:42,340
我第一次迷失是在大学的时候
You see, I first lost sight of the light back in college.

96
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,060
我跟我姐妹会的一个女生相恋了
I fell in love with one of my sorority sisters,

97
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,140
基妮
Jeannie.

98
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,780
在我父母的高尔夫俱乐部
I taught her how to play golf

99
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,170
我教她怎麽打高尔夫
at my parents' country club.

100
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:52,310
然後那天晚上  顺其自然的发生了
And then one night it just happened.

101
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,910
我们在第十八洞的草地上做爱
We made love on the 18th green.

102
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,470
天啊  我到现在还记得那个洞
God! oh, I still remember that hole.

103
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,710
但  她跟一个职业高尔夫选手订婚
But then, uh, she got engaged to a golf pro

104
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,030
然後搬去  北卡罗来纳州的派恩赫斯特
and moved to Pinehurst, North Carolina.

105
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,940
很遗憾
Sorry.

106
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,500
当她离开我的时候  我还以为我会死
When she left, I thought I would die.

107
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,380
我尝试跟不同的女人交往来忘记她
And I tried to get over it by going from woman to woman.

108
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,810
後来我开始问我自己   我怎麽会
And I started to wonder how I ended up

109
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,120
沉沦到如此地步
in such darkness.

110
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,780
从那时候开始 我想试图重回正常的生活
And that's when I started to find my way back to the light.

111
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:24,670
那你呢?
What about you?

112
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,180
我向上帝承诺过
I made a promise to god.

113
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,840
好酷啊
Oh, far out!

114
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,100
我是说  我真的相信他能听到我们的祷告
I mean, you know I... I really think he hears us, you know.

115
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,680
那你觉得
Uh, so, what do you say,

116
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,630
我们改天一起出去如何?
maybe you and me go out together some time?

117
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,820
你的意思是...
You mean, like o-on...

118
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,020
像约会那样吗?
on a date?

119
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,020
我不知道
I don't know. Uh...

120
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,550
你不是想成为一个成功的案例吗?
I thought you wanted to be a success story.

121
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,920
我真的很想
More than anything.

122
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,810
那我们就一起努力吧
Well then let's go for it.

123
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,630
明晚八点我来接你
Tomorrow night. I'll pick you up at 8:00.

124
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,510
-好  -好的
- All right.  - Okay

125
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,340
太棒了  但是...
It's great. But, um...

126
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,020
不是应该我去接你吗?
Aren't I supposed to pick you up?

127
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:07,250
对  好的
Yeah. Huh, right. Okay.

128
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,290
随便弄了些零食
Whipped you up a little snack.

129
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:16,180
所谓零食
"A little snack"

130
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,500
应该是一把"嘎吱船长"(喜瑞儿麦片)
is a handful of Captain Crunch.

131
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,230
家里刚好没有"嘎吱船长"了
I'm fresh out of Captain Crunch.

132
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,770
这是一点义大利面  番茄乾
This is a little penne, sun-dried tomato.

133
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,840
白酒奶油酱加上一些芝麻
That's a white wine cream sauce with arugula,

134
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,690
还有一些梅洛红酒
and a witty little Merlot.

135
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,450
好烫
Oh. It's hot!

136
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,860
我烫到舌头了
I burn... I...I burned my tongue.

137
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,450
我来帮你降温一下
Well let me cool it down for you.

138
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,620
最好不是我想的那个人
That better not be who I think it is.

139
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,020
是泰德
It's Ted.

140
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,070
我打扰到你了吗?
Hey, am I disturbing you?

141
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,210
我正躺在床上
So I'm lying in bed.

142
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,660
我正在看G片  太恐怖了
I'm watching this porno flick, right? It's terrible.

143
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,920
这两个男的竟然边做爱
These two guys are fucking and

144
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,230
边吃义大利面
eating pasta at the same time.

145
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,630
真有人会那样做吗?
Like anyone would really do that, right?

146
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,890
布莱恩刚才打给我
When Brian calls.

147
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,500
我觉得他快崩溃了
I think he's kind freaking out.

148
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,380
崩溃?
Freaking out?

149
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,470
对  他要我以一个会计师身份告诉他
Yeah. He wanted me to tell him, as his accountant,

150
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,090
他失业以後  他的存款还可以生活多久
how long he could go without a job.

151
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,350
那你怎麽说?
And what did you tell him?

152
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,130
像他那样花钱方式?  最多两个月
The way he spends? Two months, tops.

153
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,270
那他说什麽?
And what did he say?

154
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,610
他说非常感谢我
He thanked me very much

155
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,590
谢我一直以来当他的良师益友
for being such a wonderful and compassionate friend.

156
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,270
天啊  他真的是要崩溃了
Oh, my god, he is freaking out.

157
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,620
我晚点打给你
I'll call you later.

158
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,300
好的
All right.

159
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,320
怎麽了?
What's the matter?

160
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,750
是布莱恩  我得打电话给他
It's Brian. I've got to call him. Uh...

161
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,850
大卫  你不懂
David, you don't understand.

162
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,290
他要破产了  他要失业了
He's gonna go broke. He's gonna lose his job.

163
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,310
是你不懂
You don't understand.

164
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,270
我们不能拥有像茉蕾妮和琳赛
We're not going to have a relationship

165
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,480
那样的关系
like Melanie and Lindsay.

166
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,490
当然我们不能
Of course we're not.

167
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,490
我们又不是拉拉
We're not lesbians.

168
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,970
我的意思是
I mean...

169
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,880
在这个家里  我们的家里
There's only room in this...

170
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,120
我们的床上  我们生活里只能有
house, our house, our bed, our life,

171
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:04,800
我和你
for you and me,

172
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,620
而不是你和我  还有布莱恩
not for you and me and Brian.

173
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,470
我知道
I know.

174
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,680
答应我你不会让自己牵扯到
Promise me that you won't involve yourself

175
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,520
他的问题里  这是他自作自受
in his problems. He's made his own bed.

176
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,540
他可能因这件事被起诉
Now he can get sued in it.

177
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,770
我老实告诉你  你毁了我的生活
Let me get this straight. You fuck up my life,

178
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,220
你毁了我的爱情
you destroy my relationship,

179
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,880
现在你竟然还有种来找我
and now you have the astonishing, breathtaking gall

180
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,420
叫我当你的诉讼律师?
to ask me to represent you?

181
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,680
是的  我会付你钱的
Yeah. And I'll pay too.

182
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,250
收好你的钱  据我所知
Oh, keep your money, because from what I hear,

183
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,320
你可能很快会用到
You're going to need it.

184
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,620
好吧  恐同的美国公司再次获胜
Fine. Homophobic corporate America wins again.

185
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,120
拜托  就算你在办公室门口挂个牌子
Oh, please. You could hang a sign on your office door

186
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,870
写着「口交一次十分钱」
saying "blow jobs, 10 cents"

187
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,750
你还是可以
And you'd still have it better

188
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,470
过得比女人和非白种人好
than any woman or person of colour

189
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,680
你知道吗?  因为你是白人
because guess what? You're a white man.

190
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,750
在这个国家还是有点优势的
Which still counts for something in this country.

191
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,250
谢谢
Thanks.

192
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,470
好吧  让我开心一下
All right, just for laughs,

193
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,950
说说看关於这事  你的说词
give me your version of the story.

194
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,910
他想要  我就上了
He wanted it, I gave it to him.

195
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,220
不出所料  短而甜蜜
Like I asked for, short but sweet.

196
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,650
不是你想的那麽短
It wasn't that short.

197
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:13,030
那你这无私慷慨的举动  在哪发生的?
And where did this act of selfless generosity take place?

198
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,770
在我的办公室 还有我家
In my office and in my loft.

199
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,050
既然他之後还来找你上床
So he couldn't have minded it too

200
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,740
证明他根本不太在意  继续说
much if he came back for more. Go on.

201
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,240
然後他要我  帮他升职
Then he asked me to help him get a promotion.

202
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,310
你怎麽回答他?
What did you tell him?

203
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,390
我告诉他  他经验还不够
I told him he wasn't ready.

204
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,310
他怎麽回答?
How did he take it?

205
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,490
你说呢?
How do you think?

206
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,550
他觉得因为我们都是同志
He felt because we were both gay,

207
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,730
而且他跟我上床过了  所以理所当然
And we'd fucked, that somehow

208
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,320
他应该享有优先往上爬的权力
he was entitled to a free ride.

209
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,410
我没有答应
I didn't agree.

210
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:34,730
你一个月有多少炮友?
How many tricks do you have a month?

211
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,120
二三十个吧
20, 30.

212
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,810
天啊  多美妙的人生
Jesus, what a life.

213
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,410
我和多少人上床  跟这件事有关系吗?
What does the number of guys I do have to do with it?

214
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,580
唯一一次  你干过所有会动的生物
Well for once, the fact that you

215
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,620
这个才赋
screw everything that moves

216
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,140
证明了你的地位  也是你最佳的辩词
is your finest quality and your best defense.

217
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,710
因为你不需要为了想干一个人
You didn't have to abuse your position

218
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,280
而滥用你的职权
at work in order to get laid.

219
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,720
"打炮反辩"?
"the fuck defense"?

220
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,740
我们得证明他
We've got to prove that when this

221
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,740
没有得逞後
kid didn't get what he wanted,

222
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,970
他决定用法律诉讼进行报复
he decided to use the law in order to get even.

223
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,750
所以你会接这个案子吗?
Then you'll take the case?

224
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,800
听着  不是我想要救你才帮你
Look, not that I give a shit about saving your ass,

225
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,510
只是  让你後半辈子欠我份人情
But it might be amusing to have you indebted to me

226
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,940
也许还满有趣的
for the rest of your life.

227
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,500
跳吧
Do it.

228
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,250
-跳吧  -跳吧
- Do it. - Do it.

229
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,030
-跳吧  -跳吧
- Do it. - Do it.

230
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,830
往前跳一大步
Do the hustle.

231
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:56,930
可以别这样吗?
Do you mind?

232
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,990
怎麽了?  小公主
What's the matter, princess?

233
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,870
我在做家庭作业
I'm trying to do my homework.

234
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,330
好吧  打扰了
Well, excuse us!

235
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,740
嘿  小迈
Hey, Mikey.

236
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,580
他们在干嘛?
What are they doing?

237
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,550
重温年轻时光
Reliving their youth.

238
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,170
跳个哈索舞
Do the hustle!

239
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,200
你们真的是怪咖一族
You people are so weird.

240
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,190
如果你不喜欢
Well, if you don't like it,

241
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,790
你为何不回你房间?
Why don't you just go up to your room?

242
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,550
让我重述一下  「我的房间」
Oh, let me rephrase that, "my room".

243
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,050
你能别纠结这事儿了吗?
Would you let it go, already?

244
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,520
是啊  小迈
Yeah, Mikey.

245
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,900
你现在可是医生娘
You're a doctor's wife now.

246
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,120
对啊
That's right.

247
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,770
想想我过去一直担心
And to think I used to worry

248
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:43,910
你会一辈子都跟在那个人的屁股後面
that you'd be spending your life

249
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,140
他叫什麽名字来着?
following after... What's his name?

250
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,930
你能不能  不提布莱恩?
Would you leave Brian out of this?

251
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,500
他已经有够多的麻烦要处理了
He's got enough shit to deal with.

252
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,630
什麽麻烦?
What kind of shit?

253
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:55,710
一个员工告他性骚扰
Some guy at work is suing him for sexual harassment.

254
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,290
这很严重  他可能会丢掉工作
It's really serious. He could lose everything.

255
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,160
我早知道  总有一天他会
I knew some day he'd stick his dick

256
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,200
被他的小弟弟所害
where it didn't belong.

257
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,820
我们应该做点什麽
Well, we've got to do something.

258
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,830
小阳光  我想你没有什麽可以帮他
Sunshine, I don't think there's anything you can do.

259
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:08,950
恐怕...
I'm afraid...

260
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,990
布莱恩最後搞了  他最不该搞的人...
Brian's fucked the last person he should have...

261
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,360
他自己
himself.

262
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,740
很抱歉  亲爱的
I'm sorry, honey.

263
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,140
你是他最好的朋友
You're his best friend.

264
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,980
你应该做点什麽的
You should do something.

265
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,520
我一定会帮他的  如果我能帮上忙的话
I...I would do something if I could.

266
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:31,210
管好你自己吧
J-just mind your own business.

267
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,300
请找卡麦伦医生
Dr. Cameron, please.

268
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:42,610
我是迈克
It's michael.

269
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,250
我知道我们今晚已经安排好了  但是
Listen, um, I I know we had plans tonight, but, uh,

270
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,510
我妈妈  她有点不舒服
My mom's got this... She's not feeling well.

271
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:57,230
她得了流感  感冒发烧又咳嗽的
She's got this flu-cough-fever-cold kind of a thing,

272
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,680
是啊  你知道的  所以我想...
Yeah, you know? And I thought I'd, you know,

273
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,100
陪在她身边照顾她
Stick around, and, uh, keep her company.

274
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:08,920
去你的
Fuck you.

275
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,230
听着  我只是想让你知道
Look, I-I just want you to know

276
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,770
-我对这件事感到很抱歉  -是喔?
- That I'm really sorry about this. - Really?

277
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,260
这可真让我好过些
That makes me feel a lot better.

278
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,730
我  我别无选择  如果...
Uh, I... I had no choice. If...

279
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,030
如果我不依你的要求做的话
if I didn't do what you wanted,

280
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:20,740
你会开除我
You'd have fired me.

281
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,300
不  你只是想帮人口交来获得升职
No, you just tried to get ahead by giving head,

282
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,420
顺带一提  你的技术还不怎麽样
Which, by the way, you're not very good at.

283
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,110
很明显地
We obviously

284
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,020
我们的记忆有很大的出入
remember things very differently.

285
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:30,770
是的
Yeah!

286
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,680
我记得发生什麽事
I remember what happened.

287
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:39,190
如果你不介意我的建议
If I could propose something...

288
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,440
我很乐意忘掉整件事  如果
I'd be more than willing to forget the whole thing if...

289
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,540
你跟我说你很抱歉  然後
you'll say you're sorry, and

290
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,070
重新考虑让我晋升
reconsider me for that position.

291
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,800
你知道吗  你还真是有提案的天分
You know, you have a real talent for propositions.

292
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,350
能不要站这麽近吗?
Would you mind not standing so close?

293
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,180
怎麽?
Why?

294
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,390
你担心会发生什麽事吗?
You worried something might happen?

295
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,440
像是我可能会用我的职权
Like I might use my position of power

296
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,290
来占你那紧实小菊花的便宜?
to take advantage of your tight little asshole?

297
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,040
天啊
God!

298
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,880
滚出我的办公室
Get out of my office.

299
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,080
在和你一起看「歌剧魅影」之前
You know, I never realized till seeing it with you

300
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,580
我从没想过这是一部壮烈的悲剧
that "a night at the opera" was such an epic tragedy.

301
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,240
很抱歉  只是去年万圣节
I'm sorry. It's just that last halloween,

302
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,510
琳赛扮演格罗克  而我扮演哈普
Lindsay went as Groucho and I went as Harpo.

303
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,290
怪不得你这麽激动
Well, that explains it.

304
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,190
哦  天啊
Oh god,

305
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,860
不是针对你  但我真希望她能陪我来看
Nothing personal, but I just wish she was here.

306
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,300
我能理解
I understand.

307
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,200
大部份和我约会的人  都希望
Most of my dates wish

308
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,210
他们是和其他人在一起
they were with someone else.

309
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,470
别那样说
Oh, don't say that.

310
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:46,000
-你是个理想的对象  -我知道
- You're a real catch. - I know.

311
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:49,200
我真走运  拉拉们都觉得我魅力无限
Just my luck, lesbians find me irresistible.

312
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,790
-不是吧  -怎麽了?
- Holy shit! - What?

313
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,140
我让你性奋了?
I got you all excited?

314
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,350
难以置信
I don't believe it.

315
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,280
泰德  茉
Ted. M...

316
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,100
茉蕾妮  你们好
Melanie, h-hi.

317
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,910
这是海瑟
Um, this is Heather.

318
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,190
我的约会对象
My date.

319
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,880
-抱歉  我以为你说她是...  -他说了
- I'm sorry, I thought you said... - He did.

320
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:16,730
我们要去吃披萨
We're going for pizza.

321
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:17,750
你们要一起来个双人约会吗?
 You want to double?

322
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,480
-双人约会?  -对啊
- Double? - Yeah.

323
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,670
他们不是一对  海瑟
They're not really a couple, Heather.

324
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,070
-我是甲甲(男同)　-我是拉拉(女同)
-I'm a homo.　　 -And I'm a lesbo.

325
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,290
我刚才看你们拥抱还以为你们是正常人
I thought from the hug that maybe you were normal.

326
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,900
我们是正常人
We are.

327
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,360
你到底是怎麽了
What the hell's gotten into you?

328
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,650
他看到了那道光
He's seen the light.

329
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,130
那光照在哪里?  你的屁股上吗?
Where are they shining it? Up your ass?

330
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,860
"寻觅灵光"是帮我们建立一个...
"See the light" is helping us build a...

331
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:43,120
幸福的　异性恋生活
happy, heterosexual life.

332
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,320
当你建立那生活的时候
Yeah, well while you're at it,

333
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,220
为何不叫巫师先给你一个脑袋?
why don't you ask the wizard for a brain?

334
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,240
我很高兴我们可以博你一笑
I'm so glad that we amuse you.

335
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,590
谁高兴了?  我气炸了
Who's amused? I'm outraged!

336
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,750
无视她  海瑟  她无法理解
Just ignore her, heather, she doesn't understand.

337
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,080
我理解你这个混蛋
I understand you assholes

338
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,860
把同志权益运动倒退了50年
are setting back the gay rights movement about 50 years.

339
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,760
走吧  艾美特  我不太喜欢你的朋友
Come on, emmett, I don't think I care for your friends.

340
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,840
艾美特  等等
Emmett, wait.

341
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,980
至少我们能找个时间聚一聚吧?
Can we at least get together sometime?

342
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:14,580
当然可以  如果你想要...
Sure. Um, if you ever want to...

343
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,500
寻觅灵光
see the light...

344
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,760
来加入我们吧
Come to a meeting.

345
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,320
我想你应该有一点饿了
I thought you might be a little hungry.

346
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:33,980
一点?
A little?

347
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,940
你知道我们要是全吃光了会变成什麽吗?
Do you know what we'd turn into if we ate all that?

348
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,930
一对肉垮痴肥的同志
A couple of fat, flabby fags

349
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,640
而且我们再也找不到男人嘿咻了
who nobody would want to fuck, ever.

350
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,370
嘿  我们开动吧
Ah. Let's dig in.

351
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,610
你知道高中时哪件事让我记忆犹新吗?
Mmm, you know what I remember from high school?

352
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,460
是不是那次生物课上
The time in biology class

353
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,690
你射进一根试管里
when you beat off in a test tube

354
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,620
然後把试管当作业交出去这件事?
for your science project?

355
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,520
不是  是吃的
No. Food.

356
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,450
你家里总是有很多吃的
There was always lots of food at your house.

357
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,730
那是义大利传统
That's an Italian thing.

358
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,500
你家里总是有很多酒
And there was always plenty of booze at your house.

359
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,220
是啊
Yeah, huh?

360
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,160
那是爱尔兰传统
That's an Irish thing.

361
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:09,400
这是什麽?
What's this?

362
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,450
「省钱生活备忘录」
"Reality checklist"?

363
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:15,520
是的  我正在尝试把我的生活简化
Yeah, I've been thinking of simplifying my life.

364
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,480
「衣服?」
"Clothes"?

365
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,110
你的确能在衣服上省一大笔钱
You... You can certainly save money on clothes.

366
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,700
「护肤品?」
"Cosmetics"?

367
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,550
是啊  那些法国进口的抗老产品
Yeah, the french anti-aging shit

368
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,410
一支要100美元
Costs $100 a tube and...

369
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,550
我看起来还是不像19岁
I still don't look 19.

370
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,660
「出去玩」
"Going out"?

371
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,530
对啊
Yeah.

372
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,040
我觉得我每周少去一次夜店
I figured I could probably survive hitting the clubs

373
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,830
也能活下来
five times a week instead of six.

374
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,550
我可不确定  这真是很大的牺牲
I don't know. That's a pretty big sacrifice.

375
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,950
「阁楼?」
"Loft"?

376
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:41,730
嗯…
Yeah, well...

377
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:45,010
我没必要住在又大又贵的房子里，对吧？
What do I need this big, expensive place for, anyway?

378
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,310
这是你的家啊
This is your home.

379
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,960
也许事情还没到那个地步
Maybe it won't come to that.

380
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,220
如果真的那麽糟的话
Hmm. Well, if it does,

381
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,720
我就去找个甜心富老爹  像你那位医生
I'll just get a rich sugar daddy like the doc.

382
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,040
他才不是我的甜心富老爹
He's not my sugar daddy.

383
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,280
如果我不小心点  他可能就会离开我
If I'm not careful, he might not even be my boyfriend.

384
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,330
什麽?  天堂里也有烦心事?
What? Trouble in paradise?

385
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,890
他不知道我在这里
He doesn't know I'm here.

386
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,880
已经开始骗他了?
You're lying to him already?

387
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,820
他怕我把你从他身边抢走吗?
What is he afraid, I'll steal you away from him?

388
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,310
最後一支鸡腿
Last chicken leg.

389
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,980
你是专抓小鸡的老鹰
You're the chicken hawk.

390
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,390
他们是在诬陷我
I didn't do what they're saying.

391
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,350
我只是想让你知道
I just want you to know that.

392
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,230
你不需要解释
You don't have to explain.

393
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,670
嘿  你还记得吗?
Hey, you know what I remember?

394
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,600
高三的时候
Senior year

395
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,150
我们本来要加入一个乐队
we were going to be in a band.

396
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,650
你本来可成为下一个罗伯特·史密斯
You were going to be the next Robert Smith.

397
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,740
是啊  那个梦想很快就破灭了
Yeah, well, that dream died real fast.

398
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,370
那时我们超酷的
We were damn good.

399
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,220
你还留着那把吉他吗?
Hey, do you still have that guitar?

400
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,590
他们应该准许女人参赛的
You know, they ought to let women in this contest.

401
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,010
我可是胸怀大志的
I've got a great chest.

402
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,330
是啊  很大的胸
Yeah, chest of drawers.

403
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,290
嗨  大卫
Hey! David. Hi.

404
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,840
正说到「胸」怀大志呢
Speaking of great chests.

405
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,240
迈克没跟你一起?
Where's Michael?

406
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,320
在这里  他不在这里吗?
Here. He's here, isn't he?

407
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,240
我没见到他
I haven't seen him.

408
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,410
他打电话说你病了
Well, he called and said that you were sick.

409
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,600
他这麽说?
He did?

410
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:26,210
他还说他要在这里过夜
And he said he was spending the night here...

411
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,370
以便照顾你
To take care of you so...

412
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,930
所以我就带了鸡汤过来
I thought I'd bring over some chicken soup.

413
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,910
哦  你真好
Oh, that is so thoughtful.

414
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,810
正是医生的叮嘱
And just what the doctor ordered.

415
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,100
嘿  你就是医生
Hey, you're the doctor.

416
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,530
所以说  你没生病喽?
So you're not sick?

417
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,320
别这麽失望
Well, don't sound so disappointed.

418
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,110
她从1986年冬天开始嗓子就痒不停 (很吵之意)
She had a scratchy throat back in the winter of '86.

419
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:50,990
谢谢你
Thank you.

420
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,770
「你对我的爱」
Just because you love me

421
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:03,480
「不能剥夺我的自由」
doesn't mean I can't have my way

422
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,820
「我想离开」
Just because I'm leaving

423
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:11,460
「也是身不由己」
doesn't mean I don't want to stay

424
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,460
这些是他们在听证会要问你的
Okay, let's go over the questions

425
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,840
我们来演练一下
they're going to ask you at the hearing.

426
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,400
-现在吗  -哈  如果你不想让他们
- Now? 　-Huh! If you prefer,

427
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,190
把你踢出公司的话  最好就是现在
we can wait until they boot your butt out of the company.

428
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,810
哦　天啊  是你请我当辩护律师
Yes, now. Christ, you asked me to represent you...

429
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,170
好吧  我投降
Okay, fine.

430
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,020
开始吧  不过
Fire away. But...

431
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,080
温柔点
gently.

432
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,130
我说温柔点
I said gently.

433
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,810
贾斯汀  拜托一下
Justin, please?

434
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,560
对不起
Sorry.

435
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,930
把这个喝了  这是秘方调配的
Here, drink this. It's a secret recipe

436
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:20,130
我的酒鬼阿嫲过去常做这个
that my alcoholic grandmother used to make.

437
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,330
天啊  这闻起来像
Jesus! It smells like a...

438
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,260
穿过的球员内裤
dirty jockstrap.

439
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,700
这麽说来 你应该会喜欢
Well, in that case you should like it.

440
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:34,010
所谓秘方应该就是她尿在里面
The secret is she pissed in it.

441
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,800
我只是想帮你
I'm just trying to help you.

442
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,070
你知道我什麽都愿意为你做
You know I'd do anything.

443
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,540
天啊  我们祈祷法官也是同志
Oh, Jesus, let's just pray the arbitrator's gay,

444
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,730
而且觉得他很帅
and thinks he's cute.

445
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,740
对不起  我不知道你
I'm sorry, I didn't know you'd...

446
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,640
没关系的  我也不
It's okay, neither...

447
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,200
我也不知道
Neither did...

448
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,770
我过会儿再回来
I'll come back later.

449
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:52,400
不  别走  我只是在帮助布莱恩
No, stay. I... I was just helping Brian with...

450
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,260
我知道  他告诉我了
I know. He told me.

451
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,570
看看这是谁  宝贝
Look who's here, honey.

452
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,510
嗨  小伙子
Hey, buddy.

453
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,960
宝贝儿啊
Hey, sweetheart.

454
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,490
他想你了
He misses you.

455
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,780
我想
Look, um...

456
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,760
我看我们还是晚点再谈吧
Why don't we go over this later?

457
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,770
你别因为我而急着离开
You don't have to rush off because of me.

458
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,640
我得上班去了
I have to get to work.

459
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,460
能把这垃圾拿走吗
Would you get this shit away from me?

460
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,610
这是我祖母的秘方
It's my grandmother's recipe.

461
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,370
他已经醉了
He's majorly hung.

462
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,250
第一次
And for once,

463
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,260
他没在谈论我的大鵰
he's not talking about my cock.

464
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,570
别哭了  乖小伙儿
It's okay, sunnyboy,

465
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,440
你老爸会康复的
Your old man'll recover.

466
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,000
他不是因为你哭  他想念茉蕾妮了
He's not crying over you, he misses Melanie.

467
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,200
你刚刚不是有机会
Well, you just had your chance.

468
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,440
为什麽不求她回到你身边
Why didn't you beg her to come back?

469
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,360
你说什麽
Excuse me?

470
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,270
出轨的人是她
She's the one who cheated.

471
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,480
也许事出有因呢
Well, maybe she had reason.

472
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:27,710
现在你站在她那边  真是有趣极了
So, now you're taking her side? Huh, that's amusing,

473
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:32,450
这些年来 你一直都讨厌她  羞辱她
After all the years you spent hating her, humiliating her,

474
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,840
千方百计逼她离开我们之间
trying to force her out of our lives every chance you got.

475
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,390
恭喜你啊  你的目的达成了
Well, congratulations, you finally got what you wanted.

476
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,190
你说得对
Yeah, that's right,

477
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,270
都怪我吧
Blame me.

478
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,730
为什麽不？
Why not?

479
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,590
所有人都爱怪我头上
Everybody else does.

480
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,700
也许这正是你想要的结果
Well, maybe you finally got what you wanted.

481
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,540
听着
Look,

482
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,850
我得提前回去上班
I'm going to have to go back to work sooner than I thought,

483
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,800
所以我得找个保姆
which means I'll need a sitter.

484
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,750
我来吧  我和盖斯相处得很好
I'll do it. I'm great with gus.

485
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:58,400
我知道的  不过我需要一个全职保姆
Oh, I'm sure. Only I need someone full-time.

486
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,550
贾斯汀  帮我把支票簿拿来
Justin, will you get my cheque book?

487
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,670
你确定吗？
Are you sure?

488
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,610
我是说  你现在这个情况
I mean, with what's going on...

489
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:11,610
小事一椿
It's not a problem.

490
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,740
我说过我会照顾你和盖斯的
I said I'd look after you and Gus,

491
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,530
我不会食言的
and I am.

492
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,390
-谢谢你    -不客气
-Thanks. -Yeah.

493
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,490
什麽
What?

494
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,140
我知道我身上很难闻
I know I smell bad.

495
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,720
是伏特加的味道
It's Vodka.

496
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,650
出什麽事了
Something wrong?

497
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:45,940
没有  没事
No. Not at all.

498
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,360
只是  你能别再让那些大象
Except, could you keep the elephants

499
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,950
在楼梯上跑来跑去了吗
from running up and down the stairs?

500
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,930
你说什麽
Excuse me?

501
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,170
没事
Nothing.

502
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,530
你凌晨三点才回来
You got in 3 last night.

503
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,300
是吗
I did?

504
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,570
你妈妈一定病得很严重
Your mother must've been really sick.

505
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,400
你知道的  流感  咳嗽
Yeah, well you know those flu-cough...

506
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,420
受凉发烧之类的
Fever-cold kind of things?

507
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:08,220
迈克  我知道她没生病
Michael, I know she wasn't sick

508
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,660
我去她家找你了
'cause I went over there to find you.

509
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,940
-他妈的　　  　-然後呢
-Oh, shit.　 -And then...

510
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,390
我赶上了伍迪吧的夜场演出
I caught the late show at Woody's.

511
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:16,650
他祖妈的
Double shit.

512
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:19,140
你知道的  你和布莱恩合奏得挺好听
You know, you and Brian play pretty well together.

513
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,180
你们两个真是
The two of you... Well I...

514
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,600
当然　我还有什麽好惊讶的
Of course I shouldn't be surprised.

515
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,990
我跟你说过了
I told you, Brian's going through

516
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,340
布莱恩现在过得很痛苦
a really tough time right now.

517
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,060
是的  但我也跟你说过
Yeah, and I told you something too.

518
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,000
所以  如果事情要变成这样的话
So if this is the way it's going to be,

519
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,090
你对我撒谎  是为了去和他见面
You lying to me so that you can be with him...

520
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,450
我觉得要重新考虑我们之间了
I think we better rethink things.

521
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,970
你他妈的是怎麽回事？
What the fuck's the matter with you,

522
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,800
骗大卫说我病了
Lying to David, telling him I was sick?

523
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:48,300
我当时都无言以对
I didn't know what to say.

524
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,300
-无言？这可鲜了　　　  -闭嘴
-And that was a first.　 -Shut up.

525
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,290
好啦  我做错了
All right, I made a mistake.

526
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,440
你当然做错了　如果你还继续这样
You're damn right you did. And you keep this up,

527
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,840
会毁了你们的关系  听到没
You're going to blow it, you hear me?

528
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,490
我说我知道错了，行吗？
I already said I was wrong, okay?

529
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,650
如果你想折磨人的话
If you want to torture someone, go to

530
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:01,380
去马路对面的「ＳＭ」酒吧
the "S and M" bar across the street.

531
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,060
你们怎麽无精打采的
What's with you guys, anyway?

532
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,180
这里可是同志酒吧
This is supposed to be a gay bar, remember?

533
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:12,090
我昨晚看到艾美特和一个女人在一起
I saw Emmett last night, with this woman.

534
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,780
至少当时她是这麽介绍自已的
At least that's how she purported to represent herself.

535
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:18,820
他真的要变直男了
He really is going straight.

536
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,510
我们不也是
And so are we.

537
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,600
我们都直入地狱了   照他们的话来说
Straight to hell, according to them.

538
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,470
但他不知道
Yeah, but doesn't he know that every reputable

539
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:27,510
过去25年进行的各种知名心理学研究
psychological study done within the past 25 years

540
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:30,050
都明确说到人的性向
emphatically states that a person's sexual orientation

541
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,710
在6岁就确定了
is determined by age of six,

542
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,060
有时甚至出生前就确定了
Sometimes even before birth,

543
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,330
而且这是完全无法改变的
And it's completely unalterable?

544
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,540
你告诉他们啊  小阳光
You tell 'em, sunshine.

545
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,720
江山易改　本性难移
A leopard can't change his stripes.

546
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,540
同志也一样
Either can a queer.

547
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:42,500
但是
You know,

548
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,660
江湖险恶
it's a nasty world out there.

549
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,740
如果艾美特没有勇气做基佬
So, if Emmett hasn't got the guts to be gay,

550
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:51,070
要我说  去他娘的
then I say fuck him.

551
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,360
但他仍是我们的朋友
You know, he's still our friend.

552
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,510
我就是无法接受他要离开
I just can't let him go that easily.

553
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,270
来杯史多力加冰
Can I get a stoli on the rocks?

554
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,470
我以前没见过你吧
Haven't I seen you before?

555
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,870
这可是老梗
That's original.

556
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,630
然後我应该回答「不，我们没见过」
And the answer is, "No, I don't think so."

557
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:32,210
不  那晚在巴比伦
No. It was the other night, at Babylon.

558
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,190
我记得你
I remember you.

559
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,690
但我不记得你
Well, I don't remember you.

560
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,460
加班了  医生
Working late, doc?

561
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,730
有点文书工作要做
Catching up on some paperwork.

562
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,630
听说你有点小问题
So I hear you have a problem.

563
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:07,210
对头  我的屁股里有根刺
Yeah, I've got this pain in my ass.

564
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,440
也许是用力过度造成的
Maybe it's from over-exertion.

565
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,480
也许就是你造成的
Maybe it's you.

566
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,620
那我怎麽帮你缓解病情呢
So how can I help alleviate your condition?

567
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,100
你可以放了小迈
You can lay off Mikey.

568
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,310
我的处方是
Well, my prescription for that

569
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,350
管好你自己的事
would be for you to mind your own business.

570
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,770
他就是我的事
He is my business.

571
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:24,100
而且在你离开他之後　我还得去安慰他
And he's going to be my business, long after you're gone.

572
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,270
我哪都不会去
I'm not going anywhere.

573
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,730
而且  我听说你有办法脱身了
Although I did hear that you may be on your way out.

574
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,390
谁告诉你的
Who told you that?

575
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:33,410
每个人都知道
Practically everyone,

576
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,090
但这不关我们的事
although that's not our concern.

577
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,790
但你的伴侣不这样认为
Your better half thinks differently.

578
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:40,810
我要他别搅和进去
I told my "better half" to stay out of it.

579
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,130
别来见我吗？
By forbidding him to see me?

580
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,430
告诉你
You know,

581
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,610
这样你留不住他
That's not how you're going to keep him.

582
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,720
只会失去他
That's how you're going to lose him.

583
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,200
医生
You know, doc,

584
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,070
你真不赖
You are good.

585
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,870
我的疼痛
That pain I was having is...

586
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:02,910
不药而愈了
feeling better already.

587
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,430
有什麽感觉
Feel anything?

588
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,730
有点麻麻的刺痛感
A numb, tingling sensation.

589
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:39,470
但我发现是脚麻了
But, uh, then I realized my... leg's asleep.

590
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,400
你呢
How about you?

591
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,760
胃里有点恶心
Um, just a queasiness in my stomach,

592
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,530
就像吃了坏掉的蛤仔肉一样
like when you eat a bad clam.

593
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:54,030
我们不是非做不可的
Look, we... don't have to do this.

594
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,920
不  我想要一个完美的结局
No! I want a success story.

595
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,070
我也是
Oh, so do I.

596
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,880
也许我们
Uh, maybe if we, um...

597
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,350
也许我们可以幻想一下
maybe if we fantasized.

598
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,060
你幻想一个完美男人
You know, you... think about the perfect man,

599
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,910
我幻想一个完美的女人
and I'll think about the perfect woman.

600
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,190
精神上的辅助也许可以帮我们
It's a crutch, but... if it helps us walk...

601
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,460
怎麽样
Well?

602
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:43,920
继续
Keep trying.

603
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,790
然後
And?

604
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,800
我觉得我有点感觉了
I think I'm starting to feel something.

605
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,550
我也是
Me too.

606
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,100
又是你
Aw, it's you again.

607
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,630
你还真是执着
You don't give up, do you?

608
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,400
你想要我放弃吗
You want me to?

609
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:53,210
你真的见过我吗
Did you really see me before?

610
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:56,440
是的  你和那个布莱恩在一起
Sure. You were with that guy, Brian.

611
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,020
你怎麽认识他
How do you know him?

612
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:02,100
大家都认识他
Everyone knows Brian Kinney.

613
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:04,120
他是个大混蛋
He's a real asshole.

614
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,980
-是吗　　　-是的
- Oh, really? - Yeah.

615
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,150
他总是过来追你
He's always coming on to you,

616
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:11,520
装的真的喜欢你一样
acting like he likes you.

617
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,970
其实他只是想打一炮
Really all he cares about is getting laid.

618
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,430
你怎麽知道的
How do you know?

619
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,360
他伤过你的心吗
Did he break your heart?

620
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,800
当然没有
Fuck no!

621
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,310
我没信过他的鬼话
I'd never fall for his shit.

622
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,140
而且  他不是我的菜
Besides, he's not my type.

623
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:29,740
他是你菜的吗
Is he yours?

624
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,330
开什麽玩笑
Are you kidding?

625
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,920
那什麽样才是你的菜？
So what is your type?

626
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:59,650
你可以做到!  可以做到!
You can do it. You can do it.

627
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:00,990
你可以做到
You can do it!

628
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:47,040
你感觉怎麽样
So... how was it for you?

629
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,580
我不怎麽排斥
You know, I didn't hate it.

630
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,010
你呢
Oh? You?

631
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,580
没有我想的那麽令人恶心
It wasn't nearly as disgusting as I thought it would be.

632
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,430
幻想真的起作用了
The fantasies really helped.

633
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:02,010
是的
Yeah.

634
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,250
你想的是谁
Who'd you use?

635
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,690
《安娜与国王》的茱迪·福斯特
Jodie Foster, "Anna And The King".

636
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:08,980
你呢
Ah. You?

637
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:14,360
《杀戮时刻》的马修·麦康尼
Uh, Matthew Mcconaughey in "A Time To Kill".

638
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,950
可惜我们没用《接触未来》
Mmm. Too bad we didn't use "Contact",

639
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:17,830
要不我们就可以在同一部电影了
We could've been in the same movie.

640
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:18,520
是啊
Yeah.

641
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,750
我们有自己的成功范例了
Well, we... have our success story.

642
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,860
是啊
Yay us. Huh.

643
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:41,240
你个性感的小贱人
You're one hot little fucker.

644
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,890
你也很性感啊
You're pretty hot yourself.

645
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:47,000
哦～耶
Oh, yeah.

646
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:48,910
来啊　舔它
Go on, lick it.

647
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,020
就这样
That's it.

648
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:00,810
你比我上周遇到的男人好多了
You're hotter than the guy I had last week.

649
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:02,780
是吗
Is that so?

650
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:06,510
他要我穿着内裤　然後打我小屁屁
He wanted to put me in short pants and spank me.

651
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,530
我想要做的可不只这样
I want to do a lot more than that.

652
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,520
像什麽？
Like what?

653
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,590
不如直接做给你看
Like how about I show you?

654
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:32,060
不过你最好快点
Hey, you better hurry, though.

655
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:36,150
急什麽
What's the rush?

656
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,980
我午夜前回家
I've got a stupid curfew if you can believe it.

657
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,080
我父母的宵禁令
My parents want me home by midnight.

658
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,660
你...  还和父母住在一起？
You... live with your parents?

659
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,670
不然我还能住哪里？
Where else would I live?

660
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,320
我才17岁
I'm 17.

661
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:52,420
你17岁？
You're 17?

662
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,120
那你怎麽进酒吧的
So, how do you get into bars?

663
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,340
呃… 　假身份证啊
Duh! Like a fake I.D.

664
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,840
我不会告诉我爸爸的
I don't tell my dad though.

665
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,450
他会抓狂 发神经的
He goes totally psycho.

666
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,820
他发现我是同性恋之後　简直疯了
Like he did when he found out I was gay.

667
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:10,240
嗯…　你爸爸会抓狂？
Mmm, your... dad went psycho?

668
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:13,040
他抓着当时干我的男人
He went after the guy I was fucking at the time.

669
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,980
送到警察局去
Turned him in to the police.

670
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,700
警察局
Uh, the police?

671
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,110
判了10年
He'll be out in 10 years.

672
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,980
如果他知道我在这
If he knew I was here...

673
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:30,460
他怎麽会知道呢
Now, how would he know?

674
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:33,820
他不会知道的
Oh. There's no way.

675
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,270
除非我告诉他
Unless I told him.

676
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:41,970
但你不会说的  对吧
But you wouldn't do that, would you?

677
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,510
当然不会
Of course not.

678
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,260
我绝不会做这种事的
I would never do anything like that.

679
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,880
但是你得帮我个忙
Provided you do something for me.

680
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,390
记住  让我来谈
Remember, let me do the talking.

681
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,020
好的  这是你的强项
Yeah. You always do.

682
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:02,700
人力资源部调查员对你的提问
And when the investigator from H.R. asks you something,

683
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,070
-都得先和我商量再回答  -知道了
- confer with me first. - I got it.

684
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,150
不管结果怎麽样
Listen, however this plays out...

685
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,290
谢了
Thanks.

686
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:18,590
你本来没必要帮我的
You didn't have to help me.

687
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,740
你可以直接说「去你妈的」
You could have said "fuck you".

688
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,400
我知道
I know.

689
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,110
你在这儿啊  我在找你呢
Here you are, I was looking for you.

690
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,440
这位是
This is, uh...

691
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,920
莫蒂·瑞得  我老板
Morty Ryder, my boss.

692
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,890
这是茉蕾妮·马库斯  我的律师
This is Melanie Marcus, my attorney.

693
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,140
很高兴见到你
Nice to meet you.

694
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,390
自由航空扩充了一条
Look, Liberty Air was just awarded

695
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:35,860
到拉瓜迪亚的新航线
a new route into La Guardia.

696
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,890
主要是与东北部的企业合作
They're taking on the majors in the northeast.

697
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,550
-所以呢 　 -所以
- So?  　　- So,

698
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,310
他们想由你推销  打开国际市场
they want to go national with your campaign.

699
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,910
有很多事等着你做呢
You've got a lot of work to do.

700
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:46,180
那听证会呢
What about the hearing?

701
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,080
忘了听证会　控诉撤销了
Forget about the hearing. That matter's been dropped.

702
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,010
撤销了
Dropped?

703
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:50,870
怎麽回事
What happened?

704
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:53,490
我哪知道  而且谁在乎呢
Damned if I know, and who the hell cares?

705
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:55,030
5分钟後到我办公室来
Be in my office in five minutes.

706
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:03,140
真他妈的难以置信
Un-fucking-believable.

707
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,160
天啊  你是谁啊
Jesus! What are you,

708
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,500
特氟隆先生吗 (厕所清洁剂)
Mr.Teflon?

709
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,220
臭屎永远不会黏上身  (倒霉事不上身)
Shit just never sticks to you.

710
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,950
不知道怎麽  就像你和艾美特
I don't know how to... like, you or Emmett,

711
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,750
或许你想加入保龄球社团
But you might like to join a bowling league.

712
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:23,170
只限男性
Just the guys.

713
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:25,370
他在那儿
Oh, look, there he is.

714
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,170
或许这不是个好主意
You know, maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

715
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,480
我们出去吧
Let's just get out of here.

716
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,240
真是个惊喜啊
Well, this is a surprise.

717
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,670
欢迎来到「寻觅灵光」
Welcome to "see the light".

718
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:45,860
看这些人穿的衣服
The way some of these people dress,

719
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,790
他们应该改叫「驱除灵光」吧
they should change it to "turn off the light".

720
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:52,070
这是什麽意思？要强抢民女吗？
So what is this, like, an intervention?

721
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,340
你们要来绑架我
You're going to kidnap me and

722
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,090
然後把我丢进小货车的车箱？
throw me in the back of a van?

723
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:57,090
话说前头  我是不会上车的
I'll tell you right now, I'm not getting in any van.

724
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:58,180
没有什麽小货车
There's no van.

725
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,680
我连小货车都用不到吗？
I don't get a van?

726
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:02,210
我以为  至少也要租辆小货车
I think, at the very least, you could rent a van.

727
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:04,590
就只有我们两个，好吗？
Look, it's just us, Okay?

728
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,540
我们是来
And we came here to...

729
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,680
我不知道我们为什麽来这儿
I don't know why the fuck we're here but, you know...

730
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,700
艾美特  我们  试图跟你沟通
Emmett, we... We tried talking to you,

731
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,280
也试着跟你讲明道理
we tried reasoning with you.

732
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,950
我们甚至还叫了个G星
We sent a porn star.

733
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:21,210
-1000块啊　　   -好啦  算了吧
- $1,000.　　 　- It's Okay. Just let it go.

734
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:21,620
我知道
I know.

735
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:24,780
来吧  大家
Come on, everyone, let's, uh,

736
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:26,600
组成我们的灵光之圈吧
form our circle of light, hmm?

737
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,180
我们
We just...

738
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,710
我们想告诉你  我们还是爱你的
We wanted to let you know that we still love you.

739
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,730
也许没有上帝那麽爱你
Maybe not as much as Jesus,

740
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,730
但是
But...

741
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,000
也差不多了
Almost.

742
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:41,990
而且我们会想你的
And that we're going to miss you.

743
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,550
尤其想你跳舞的时候
Especially miss the way you dance

744
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,700
把手举过头顶的样子
with your hands over your head,

745
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,640
还有你的莉莎模仿秀  那是
and your Liza impersonation. That's...

746
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:50,090
我用来怀念你的方式
that's the way I'll always remember you.

747
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:51,590
谢了
Thanks.

748
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:55,500
我觉得上帝可没像你们这样欣赏我
I don't think God appreciates it quite as much as you do.

749
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,680
我觉得上帝比我们更欣赏你
Oh, I think God appreciates it even more...

750
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,800
因为祂是根据祂的形象创造你的
Because he created you in his image.

751
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:05,100
至少这是从小别人都是这麽教我的
At least that's what I was always taught.

752
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,670
因为上帝代表着爱
And since God is love and...

753
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:10,370
而且祂从不犯错
God doesn't make mistakes, then...

754
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:12,570
所以你的模样外表
you must be exactly...

755
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,720
一定就是祂希望你变成的样子
the way he wants you to be,

756
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,380
一定也是祂希望你能成变成的样子
the way he intended you to be.

757
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:21,930
不只是每一个人  甚至…
And that goes for every person, every...

758
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:25,420
每一个星球  每一座山
planet, every mountain, every...

759
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:28,890
每一粒沙  每一首歌
grain of sand, every song...

760
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,050
每一滴眼泪
every tear...

761
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:36,280
每一个屁精…
and every faggot.

762
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:43,760
我们都是祂的杰作   艾美特
We're all his, Emmett.

763
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,190
他爱我们每个人
He loves us all.

764
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,100
再见  小艾
Goodbye, Em.

765
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,350
我们要开始了噢
We're about to get started.

766
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,740
加入我们的灵光之圈吧
Come into our circle of light, hmm?

767
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:45,110
每次集会
We like to start every meeting

768
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:47,600
我们都会以一个成功的范例开场
with a success story.

769
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:53,820
而今晚  我觉得艾美特和海瑟
And tonight I just feel that Emmett and Heather

770
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:57,600
已经是成功的范例了  是不是
have a success story, don't you?

771
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:01,020
太棒了  讲来听听
Great! Let's hear it.

772
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,640
你得好好照顾这些东西  对吧
You've got to be careful with those, huh?

773
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:15,320
是的  这些都非常珍贵
Yeah, they're pretty valuable, so you

774
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,140
不能让它们见光
got to protect them from the light.

775
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,320
你肯定还在生我的气  对吧
Uh, you must be still mad at me, huh?

776
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,820
没有
No.

777
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,200
我不生气了
I'm not mad at you.

778
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,190
我想告诉你  我很抱歉  我撒谎了
Well, I want you to know that I'm sorry that I lied.

779
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,360
我也抱歉
I'm sorry too.

780
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:47,530
我  有时候
I... Sometimes I get, uh...

781
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:51,280
我想我是有点生
I guess I-I just get a little worked up

782
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,590
他的气
over, uh...

783
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:53,980
布莱恩
Brian?

784
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,170
布莱恩
Over Brian.

785
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:03,340
我几乎认识他一辈子了
I've known him practically my entire life.

786
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,620
我…  我不能就这样不见他
I... I can't just stop seeing him.

787
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:06,820
你没必要不见他
You shouldn't have to.

788
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:12,360
你可以随便去见任何你想见的人
You should feel free to see whoever you want to see.

789
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,710
毕竟  这是一段感情
After all, this is a relationship,

790
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:17,370
不是最高安全监狱
it's not a maximum security lock-up.

791
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:31,430
那麽你和布莱恩又重组乐队了
So you and Brian getting the band back together?

792
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:33,620
不了  我觉得後街男孩还
No, I don't think the Backstreet Boys

793
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,410
掩盖不了我们当年的风头
have usurped our former glory.

794
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,740
今晚你想出去吗
You want to go out tonight?

795
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:41,850
好啊
Well, sure.

796
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:43,600
那你去吧
You go.

797
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,920
-那你呢 　　　　　　　　   -我不去
- Well, what about you? 　-No.

798
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:48,770
我没什麽心情  我就呆在家吧
I'm not in the mood. I'll stay here.

799
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:51,060
你去玩  去跳舞
You go. You dance.

800
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:52,750
用你的魔鬼身材去
And you torture all those boys

801
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:54,970
折磨那些家伙吧
with your sculpted torso.

802
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,540
然後你回家  回到我身边
And then you come home to me.

803
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,900
我有个更好的主意
I think I have a better idea.

804
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:04,680
一杯马蒂尼  真是世界级美酒啊
A cosmopolitan. How cosmopolitan.

805
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:09,040
艾美特常说 「在匹兹堡里」
Emmett used to say, "in Pittsburgh,

806
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,650
「这些都是触手可及的」
It's as close as you can get."

807
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:14,840
我知道你有多想他
I know how much you're going to miss him.

808
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:19,220
事实上  你不懂
Actually, you don't...

809
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:23,270
但是  我感激你的感同身受
But, uh, I appreciate the sentiment.

810
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:24,630
跳支舞怎麽样
How about a dance?

811
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:27,650
不了  跳舞会让我想起他
Nah, it'd just remind me of him.

812
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,670
再来杯酒
Another drink?

813
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:31,140
我要开始哭了
I'd start to cry.

814
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:37,280
你的衣服掉了噢
You're losing your shirt.

815
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:41,610
-你还差点下课呢　　　  -是的
-You almost lost yours. -Ah, yeah.

816
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,710
我还是不知道他为什麽撤销了诉讼
I still have no idea why he dropped the suit.

817
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:47,140
是个迷嘛
It's a mystery.

818
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:51,690
我想  以後和别人做爱  要小心点了
I guess I'll just have to be more careful who I fuck.

819
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:56,310
你走运了    我明天就满18岁了
Lucky for you, I turn 18 tomorrow.

820
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:58,590
你生日想要什麽礼物
What do you want for your birthday?

821
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,040
一根漂亮、坚挺硬邦邦的大屌如何？
What about a nice, stiff dick?

822
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:10,940
你说起话来有点像他了
Now you're starting to sound like him.

823
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,040
我总记得  他以前常说
I'll always remember how he used to say,

824
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:17,090
「如果没有东西插进你的菊花」
"It's just not sex without...

825
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:18,310
「那不算是真的性交！」
without something up your butt."

826
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,860
你现在来巴比伦传教了吗？
Oh no, now you've come to Babylon to proselytize.

827
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:24,540
那不是我们来的目的
That's not why we're here.

828
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,110
我们已经看到了灵光
We've seen the light.

829
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:27,970
-我们知道     -我们知道
- We know! - We know!

830
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:30,750
不一样的灵光
A different light.

831
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,890
你们的成功范例怎麽样了
What about your success story?

832
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:34,540
我们成功了呀
Oh, we're a success story.

833
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:36,760
我们和小组分享了我们的故事
Oh? We shared it with the group.

834
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:40,400
我告诉了他们
I told them,

835
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:43,230
我们之中有些人喜欢舔阴道
some of us are meant to eat pussy,

836
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:45,970
有些人喜欢吮吸老二
and some of us are meant to suck cock.

837
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,400
但是不管怎麽样
But either way...

838
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,670
上帝是爱我们的
God loves us.

839
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:53,920
他们同意上帝是爱我们的
They agreed that God loves us.

840
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:56,840
然後他们要我们滚出去
And then they told us to get the fuck out.

841
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:00,560
你真的回来了？
Then you're really back?

842
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,710
宝贝  我的基情之火又复燃了
Honey, my flame has been rekindled,

843
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:05,320
而且比以前更耀眼
nd is burning brighter than ever.

844
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:14,290
抱歉
Oh! oh, sorry.

845
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:16,610
-抱歉  　-太好了
-Sorry.   -I'm not.

846
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:28,190
过来吧
Come on, you.

847
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:44,630
感觉到强大的同性节奏了吗？
Ah-h! Do you feel that gay thump-thump?

848
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:47,110
天啊  我怀念这儿！
God, I missed that!
