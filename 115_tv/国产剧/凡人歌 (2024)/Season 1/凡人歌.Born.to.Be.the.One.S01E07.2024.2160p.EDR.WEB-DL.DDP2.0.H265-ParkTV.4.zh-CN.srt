No, thanks.

Or eggy bread?

19
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,960
Can I do you some eggy bread,
my wee midgie?

20

- No. Not for me. Thanks.
- No?

Now, who is Emma T. Wilde?

22
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,800
- Why's she using a word processor?
- Don't read over my shoulder, Ian.

23
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,200
So very sorry.
Thought you might need a reader.

24
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,960
It doesn't deserve a reader. It's crap.

25
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,040
Uh, it's not crap. Nothing you do is crap.

26
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,520
Hmm?

27
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,240
- Why don't you go back to the play?
- 'Cause that too is crap.

28
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,080
Oh shit!

29
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,680
Oh God.

30
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,600
I'm going out tonight.

31
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,240
- I'm gonna stink.
- Hot, hot, hot!

32
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,440
- You cannot eat that. It's burned.
- You say burned. I say crispy.

33
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,400
Let's call the whole thing off.

34
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,000
Really wish you wouldn't fry that
when I'm about to go out.

35
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,200
- I've gotta wash my hair again now.
- No, you don't.

36
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,720
Come here.

37
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,080

Hello, Leeds.

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,600
We did lift up the carpet, yeah.
No, there was no hardwood floor.

42
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,280
It was just damp chipboard
and old newspapers, which was a shame.

43
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,640
Yeah. Yeah,
but at least we are homeowners.

44
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,320
- It's ours.
- Ian, have you seen my razor?

45
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,480
Things aren't that bad, are they?

46
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,960
Just on the phone to your mom and dad.

47
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,080
- Tell them I'll call back tomorrow.
- It's fine. They called to speak to me.

48
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,280
She's good, yeah.

49
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,000
I do have a gig tonight.
Yeah. Open mic, yeah.

50
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,320
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

51
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,520
Emma's... She's writing. Tap, tap, tap.

52
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,440
Oh yeah. It's all happening. Yeah.

53
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,640
Mm. Mm.

54
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,680
Yeah. Yeah.

61
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,080
Hey.

62
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,320
- No, thank you.
- Sure.

63
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,280
Cheers.

64
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,480
Hey.

65
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,120
- Babe, did you see it?
<i>- No, sorry. I'm in town.</i>

66
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,440
All right, Dex?

67
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,600
- How'd it go?
<i>- Yeah, it was great.</i>

68
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,640
Nine million last week
up against the football.

69
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,240
Hopefully, this week we'll get more.

70
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,040
What time are you back?
There's a party later.

71
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,720
Dex, what are you like?

72
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,840
- Well, it's all part of the job.
<i>- Is it?</i>

73
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,440
<i>- Of course it is.</i>
- Thanks.

74
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,040
- Aren't you filming tomorrow?
- Yeah. Yeah.

75
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,360
<i>But not till four.</i>

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,640
I'm knackered. I'm gonna have a night in.

77
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,640
<i>Gotta go. Love you.</i>

78
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,560
Excuse me.

79
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,840
- Are you television's Dexter Mayhew?
- The very same.

80
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,960
Oh God, it's so nice to be out.

81
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,080
And it's been so long.

82
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,800
- Well, not that long.
- Eh.

83
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,520
- You look lovely.
- Ugh. No, I don't.

84
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,520
- Cool shoes.
- Saxone.

85
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,400
- £12.99.
- Mm.

86
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,240
One day, I'm gonna give you a compliment,
and you won't reply with the price.

87
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,520
No. Never.

88
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,920
Come on.

89
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,960
Ah, of course you've succumbed.

90
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,160
- To what?
- You've got a mobile.

91
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,840
All right, you've got a choice.

92
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,480
Either you can phone me.

93
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,200
Actually me, personally.

94
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,120
Or you can phone a building,

95
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,200
in which I might just happen
to be in at the time.

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,120
The building.

97
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,000
- And what if I don't pick up?
- God forbid you should miss a call.

98
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,480
- I give you six months before you cave.
- Never.

99
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,280
- That sounds like a bet.
- Okay, a bet.

100
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,480
If I ever get a mobile phone,
you can buy me dinner.

101
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,760
What, again?

102
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,520
- Rude.
- Come on. You're gonna like this place.

103
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,320
- Hiya. The usual?
- Yeah.

104
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,880
PizzaExpress would've been fine.

105
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,720
Amazing, eh?

106
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,920
It looks like a cruise ship.

107
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,480
So nautical. Nautical but nice.

108
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,760
What time do we hit
the iceberg?

109
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,680
- Ian joining us tonight?
- What?

110
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,000
You sound like Ian.

111
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,560
"Nautical but nice."

112
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,920
Dexter!

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,120
What?

114
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,480
Love Ian.

115
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,640
- Top bloke, Ian.
- Mm.

116
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,160
- You should hear what he says about you.

- Oh. Just a G&T, please.

120
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,520
Oh God, no. You're not in the pub now.
Have a proper drink.

121
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,560
- Yes, sir?
- Two martinis. Bombay Sapphire.

122
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,680
- Very dry, with a twist.
<i>- Prego.</i>

123
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,600
Trust me. Best martinis in London.

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,200
Look. Look.

125
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,360
The trick is to get everything
really cold at the start.

126
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,880
Ice water in the glass.

127
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,960
Gin in the freezer.

128
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,200
And how do you know all this?

129
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,480
My mom taught me when I was, like, nine.

130

Oh.

131

Well, then.

132
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,680
To Alison.

133
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,160
- That was nice. What was that for?
- I'm happy to see you.

134
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,160
Mm.

Oh God.

I've never had one of these before.

137
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,040
It's like getting punched
in the face by a drink.

138
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,680
Instant drunkenness,
which is exactly what I need.

139
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
Oh?

140
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,080
- Oh God. I don't even know where to start.
- Don't start yet.

141
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,760
I'm just off to the loo.
They're incredible here.

142
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,000

Cigarettes, sir?

Cigarette girl.
They're famous for it here.

00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,360
How is Mr. Ha Ha?

162
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,920
It's a genuine question.

163
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,840
Yeah. He's good.

164
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,520
He's, um, got a gig tonight.

165
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,640
And the flat's coming along.
We're on the ladder and all that.

166
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,320
My parents are delighted. They love Ian.

167
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,640
I think my mom
might actually be in love with him.

168
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,240
- How come I've never met your mom?
- Why would you?

169
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,280
They've never visited me in London.
Not once. Well, till now.

170
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,320
Now that I've got a boyfriend
and my own home, it's like, "Ah."

171
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,240
"Now you make sense to us."

172
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,440
Mm.

173
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,240
My mom sends Ian packages.
My dad rings him for a chat.

174
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,200
We're going on a four-day
walking holiday in the Dales in September.

175
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,960
It's quite, um, intense.
Bit of a runaway train.

176
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,720
- What can I get you?
- Uh...

177
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,840
Twelve of the native oysters, please.

178
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,640
They're sweeter than rock oysters,
and they're more delicate.

179
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,200
I'll have the onglet,

180
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,160
and one more dry martini. And...

181
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,840
Oh, um...

182
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,800
Uh, yeah. Just the cod
and chips is fine, thanks.

183
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,600
You're very knowledgeable all of a sudden.

184
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,840
- Meaning?
- You seem to know a lot about food.

185
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,280
I love food and wine.
I eat out most days now.

186
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,920
As a matter of fact,

187
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,520
I've been asked if I want to review
for one of the Sundays.

188
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,040
Wow. Really? You're reviewing restaurants?

189
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,400
Uh, cocktail bars.

190
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,720
They've given me
a weekly column called "Barfly."

191
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,040
It's, uh, sort of a man-about-town
kind of thing.

192
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,560
And you'd write it yourself?

193
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,880
Of course I'd write it myself.

194
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,960
Who else would write it?

195
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,960
Hmm. Red or white?

196
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,240
I think we should start with

197
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,560
a nice biscuity Muscadet,

198
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,880
and then a Margaux.

199
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,080
Uh, how's Callum?

200
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,120
Do you see much of him, or...

201
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,560
No. No, not really.

202
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,600
Uh, why force it? You know.
We have nothing in common.

203
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,440
I think it's important not to be
too sentimental about these things.

204
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,400
I just love the vibe in this place.

205
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,920
I mean, it's... it's... it's smart.

206
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,240
But a bit theatrical.

207
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,400
- It's fun.
- Is she having fun, do you think?

208
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,600
I don't know, Em.
Are the waiters?

209
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,680
The barman?

210
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,760
It's a job. It's the same.

211
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,400
It's not quite the same.
She's the only one showing her ass.

212
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,800
Well, what can I say? Maybe her woolly
black tights are in the wash.

213
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,240
Maybe she's enjoying it.
Maybe she feels sexy in that outfit.

214
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,120
- That's feminism, isn't it?
- First wave or second?

215
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,320
Can we just not tonight?

216
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,560
- I'd quite like to have a nice time.
- Yeah. So would I.

217
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,640
Great.

218
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,840
Well, Tilly's good.

219
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,280
Yeah. She's lusting after this guy
from Nottingham called Graham.

220
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,880
- Acid House Graham, we call him...
- Back soon.

221
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,920
Same again, please.

222
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,520
More? Already?

223
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,360
What can I say?
I'm like one of those beagles.

224
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,720
Just can't stop myself.

225
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,920
Thank you.

226
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,880
Just out of interest,
what time do you finish today?

227
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,240
Do you two know each other?

228
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,440
Oh. No, no, no, no.

229
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,640
I just had to stock up.
There's a party later.

230
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,920
Mm.

231
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,480
My mate, Oliver.

232
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,200
- I've told you about him. He's a baronet.
- Oh, and?

233
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,360
What do you mean?

234
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,560
What's that got to do with anything?
Why mention it?

235
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,840
Uh, to identify him.

236
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,880
I know about nine people
called Oliver. Lemon?

237
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,960
No, thanks.

238
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,040
So where's the party?

239
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,400
Holland Park.

240
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,560
Massive great house.

241
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,880
Everyone from my show's
gonna be there. Bands, actors.

242
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,760
- You're, um... You're welcome to come.
- Mm. Sounds like it.

243
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,800
No, of course you are. It's just...
You won't know anyone, that's all.

244
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,040
I'll know <i>you.</i>

245
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,680
Having fun?

246
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,680
Hi.

247
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,040
- And Suki.
- Yeah.

248
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,240
Suki's doing really well, isn't she?
Her new show is massive.

249
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,080
Yeah, we both are.

250
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,520
You know, I prefer doing
the late-night stuff.

251
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,040
More edgy.

252
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,880
How's it going?

253
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,720
- Everyone wants a piece. It's mad.
- I meant with the two of you.

254
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,880
Yeah, she's great.

255
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,840
She gets it.

256
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,760
Gets what?

257
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,400
Being on telly.

258
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,960
She... She... She understands.

259
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,920
Well, that's romantic.

260
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,320
So this party, it's... You know.

261
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,560
Uh...

262
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,720
- I'm just worried about you getting home.
- It's okay, Dex. I get it.

263
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,640
No. No, I want you to come.
Of course I do.

264
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,120
Let's play it by ear, yeah?

265
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,480
- Yeah, okay.
- Just a sec.

276
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,360
Got a tutorial?

277
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,440
- How's your steak?
- Sensational.

278
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,920
Yeah. Really rare.

279
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,280
- How's the fish?
- Cold.

280
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,800
It's opaque. That's how fish is supposed
to be cooked. So it turns opaque.

281
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,560
Dexter, it's opaque
because it's been deep-frozen.

282
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,120
It hasn't been fully defrosted.

283
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,960
Is it?

284
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,720
Are you...

285
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,280
I'm not paying for fucking Birds Eye
fucking frozen fish. Hey!

286
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,680
Can you take this off the bill?
It's not cooked. And we'll see the menu.

287
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,240
- I'm fine.
- It's not fine.

288
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,216
- You need a main course.
- I'm really not hungry.

289
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,560
Can you just get something?
They're not gonna understand if you don't.

290
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,000
A green salad, please.

291
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,760
This is going well.

292
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
What?

293
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,560
What have I done? Hmm.

294
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,880
What have I done now?

295
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,560
Can we just... Can we just go back
to what we were talking about before?

296
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,560
Ian, your mom.

297
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,640
Let's not.

298
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,240
Fine. Then tell me something new.

299
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,440
Uh, your writing. How's the play?

300
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,960
- It's a novel.
- A novel?

301
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,560
Last time I saw you,
you were writing a play.

302
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,960
Yeah, but it wasn't working,
so I moved on.

303
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,640
Okay.

304
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,560
- Meaning?
- It's just...

305
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,560
- Never mind.
- No, come on. What?

306
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,240
What's the point starting things
if you're never gonna finish them?

307
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,200
I mean, seriously, Em. Huh?

308
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,000
Have you finished anything since, what?
The year after we left Edinburgh?

309
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,200
I've got this friend, okay?
She's a screenwriter.

310
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,080
She's super successful.
She says if you're talking about writing,

311
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,560
then you're not writing.
Either you're writing or you're not.

312
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,880
- Do it or don't do it.
- Wow.

313
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,800
Thanks, Dexter, for that valuable tip.

314
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,800
The thing is, maybe your friend
doesn't also work full-time,

315
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,320
so she may not understand
it's not quite as simple as that.

316
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,000
Is that the issue?

317
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,400
Come on, Em. That's not the issue.

318
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,800
- But you don't wanna hear it.
- Hear what?

319
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,120
Look, it's your life.

320
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,920
Okay? But if you ever wanna
get out of teaching...

321
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,400
- Why would I want to get out?
- You're shouting.

322
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,960
- I'm a bloody good teacher.
- Yep. No doubt.

323
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,360
You know what they say
about teaching, right?

324
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,880
No, Dex.

325
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,760
I'm not familiar. What do they say?

326
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,480
Those who can, do.

327
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,800
Those who can't...

328
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,080
- Say, "Fuck yourself, Dexter!"
- Jesus Christ!

329
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,720
Shit!

330
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,480
- No more martinis for you.
- Get off me.

331
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,800
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

332
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,840
Emma! Emma, come on.

333
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,400
- Come on. Come on.
- The night's over, Dexter. I'm going home.

334
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,520
Whatever it is I've done, I'm sorry.
Whatever you are angry about...

335
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,600
- You don't know?
- No, I don't know!

336
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,560
I don't know. So can you please just...
just chill the fuck out?

337
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,520
We can go somewhere and calm down.
We're both a bit pissed.

338
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,080
No, <i>you're</i> pissed.

339
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,160
You're always drunk or off your face
on something every single time I see you.

340
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,600
Do you realize I haven't seen you sober
for about three years?

341
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,760
I don't remember what you're like sober.

342
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,600
And running to the loo every ten minutes.
I don't know if it's dysentery or coke,

343
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,640
but either way, it's fucking rude.
And most of all, it's boring.

344
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,280
Even if you are there, it's in body only.

345
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,400
The whole time you're looking
over my shoulder for a better option.

346
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,160
- Not true.
- "This one's a baronet."

347
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,600
"This one's got a bloody great house."
It's such bollocks, Dexter.

348
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,040
Okay, you're a TV presenter.

349
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,800
You've not invented penicillin,
broken a deadlock on the security council.

350
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,160
It's TV, and it's crap TV at that.
Well, sod it. I've had enough.

351
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,280
Look, can we go somewhere
and talk about this?

352
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,640
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Stop. It's me!

353
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,880
It's me. Please, just come here.

354
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,320
Why are you being like this, Dexter?

355
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,560
- I'm just being myself.
- No, you're not.

356
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,480
I know what you're like. This isn't you.

357
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,120
You're horrible like this, Dexter.
You're obnoxious.

358
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,560
You always were a bit obnoxious,
every now and then.

359
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,920
A bit full of yourself.
But you were funny too,

360
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,200
and kind sometimes, and interested
in people other than yourself.

361
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,040
- I'm just having fun.
- I know.

362
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:14,040
I know you've been through a lot
in the last few years with your mom.

363
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,720
I've tried to understand that.
Really, I have, but

364
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,920
you're just not the person I used to know.

365
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,920
We're not friends anymore, Dex.
We're just not.

366
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,480
- You're always canceling and postponing.
- Or you are.

367
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,280
But tonight, there was stuff
I needed to talk to you about.

368
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,920
About Ian and me.

369
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,760
But I can't talk to you anymore,
and if I can't,

370
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,840
then what's the point of this?

371
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,400
Maybe it's just done.

372
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,760
- What's done?
- Us.

373
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,240
The friendship.

374
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,800
You said it yourself. There's no point
getting sentimental about it.

375
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,080
- Move on. One in, one out.
- Oh, I wasn't talking about us.

376
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,080
I mean, we're Dex and Em. Aren't we?

377
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,360
No. You used to make me
feel good about myself.

378
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,520
But now you make me feel like shit.

379
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,680
Like I'm not cool enough
or interesting enough or ambitious enough.

380
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,240
- I don't think that.
- Well, good. 'Cause it's bollocks.

381
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,040
I am cool and interesting and ambitious.

382
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,640
In fact, I'm fucking great,
and you used to think so too.

383
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,760
If you don't, fine. I'm not up
for being treated like an obligation.

384
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,520
Like a chore. Like you always want to be
somewhere else with someone else.

385
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,440
Sometimes I just get a bit carried away,
all right?

386
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,680
If you weren't so judgmental all the time.

387
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,760
- Am I?
- Yeah.

388
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,280
Well, I...

389
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,120
I... I don't think I am.
Well, I... I try not to be.

390
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,800
Yeah. Well, you are.

391
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,480
And patronizing.

392
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,800
And... censorious.

393
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,080
- Censorious?
- You're doing it again!

394
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,240
What am I doing?

395
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,000
"Censorious?" Like,
"How could he know that word?"

396
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,120
Because I'm so thick.

397
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,680
Such a lunk.

398
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,520
So beneath you.

399
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,960
"How could he ever possibly
write his own column?"

400
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,280
"I'm Emma Morley. I got a first."

401
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:17,520
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- So fucking what, Em?

402
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,040
'Cause here in the real world,
I'm actually doing really well.

403
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,760
And all you ever do is mock it.

404
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,360
But, you know,

405
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,400
envy is the tax you pay on success
and all that.

406
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,080
Wow.

407
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,760
Is that really what you think
is going on here?

408
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,680
- Fuck this.
- No. I...

409
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,160
Listen. I remember when we were 22,
and you said,

410
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,320
"What do you wanna be when you're 40?"
And I said, "Rich and famous,"

411
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,920
and you took the piss.

412
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
Fine.

413
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,120
But I did it.

414
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,520
I actually did what I said I was gonna do.

415
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,600
I may not be 40 yet, but I made it happen.

416
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,560
And you?

417
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,080
What?

418
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,080
You haven't, Em.

419
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,200
I don't know what you said
you wanted from this world,

420
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,240
but I'm sure this wasn't it.

421
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,760
"This"?

422
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,840
Throwing your lot in with someone
who adores you, who you don't love.

423
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,440
Am I wrong?

424
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,800
Bye, Dex.

425
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,480
Emma.

426
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,760
I'm sorry. I can't do this anymore.

427
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,840
Emma!

428
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,880
Ah, shit.

429
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,600
<i>Yes, he was telling the truth.
But only part of it.</i>

430
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,840
<i>His master is indeed,
as you rightly said, a monster.</i>

431
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,440
<i>- He's also a vampire.</i>
- Hmm. You're back early.

432
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,080
How was Terry Wogan?

433
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,560
Awful.

434
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,760
Why? What happened?

435
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,960
I don't wanna talk about it.

436
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,600
How was the gig?

437
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,160
Mm-hmm.

438
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,720
- Did you do the cats and dogs thing?
- Yep.

439
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,760
Was there heckling?

440
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,120
- Yeah, a little bit.
- Mm.

441
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,840
Maybe it's not your best material.

442
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,080
- A bit of booing, actually, tonight.
- Booing?

443
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,160
Oh.

444
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,680
- That's just part of it, though, isn't it?
- Mm.

445
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,280
Suppose so.

446
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
I suppose sometimes I just worry.

447
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,200
What?

448
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,600
That I might not be very funny.

449
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,240
Ian.

450
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,840
<i>Oui?</i>

451
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,880
You are a very, very funny man.

452
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,280
