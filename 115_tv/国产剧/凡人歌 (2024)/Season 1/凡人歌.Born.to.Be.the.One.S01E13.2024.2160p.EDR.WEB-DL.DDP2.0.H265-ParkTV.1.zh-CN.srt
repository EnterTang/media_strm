00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,600
Em.

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,200
Emma.

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,720
Hey. Em.

4
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,360
Oh my God. Turn it off. Turn it off!

5
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,800

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,120
Oh my God.

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,400
Every morning,
like this massive electric shock.

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,480
I like it.

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,440
It's like waking up in a nightclub.
What's wrong with the weather forecast...

11
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,800
I've been thinking.

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,600
I think you should give up your flat.

13
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,240
Move in.

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,000
Dex, are you asking me
to be your flatmate?

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,560
Emma, will you be my flatmate?

16
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,640
Okay, I'll think about it.

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,200
- You'll do it soon?
- Why? Are you gonna get someone else in?

18
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,760
I can't if you're always here.

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,280
Not always. Five nights.

20
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,040
I want you here every night.
That's the point.

21
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,480
I know, but living together...

22
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,800
We said we weren't gonna do that.

23
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,440
We lived together in Paris.

24
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,400
Yeah. But that was last century.

25
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,640
And Paris.

26
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,576
- What? You don't like the flat?
- No, I love it.

27
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,000
It's just such a bachelor pad.
You know, all your old flames.

28
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,440
- A long time ago.
- Yeah, but they're ghosts, Dexter.

29
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,840
They're unhappy spirits.

30
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,400
But if you move in, you'll drive them out.

31
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,760
You can bring your books and your desk.

32
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,960
Your postcards and your candles.
It'll be ours.

33
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay. But we said
we were going to be independent.

34
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,400
Isn't it exhausting,
pretending like it's not what we want?

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,280
- You know it'll be harder to have affairs?
- Oh, come on.

36
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,760
- That's what hotels are for.
- Shut up.

37
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,920

- Mm. He can wait ten minutes.
- Oh.

45
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,320
Ten minutes?

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,440
Oh, Em. Why do I feel
like I'm seeing my bank manager?

51
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,160
You'll be fine.
Just tell him. Don't ask him.

52
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,480
- Hiya. Sorry we're late.
- Hi.

53
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,640
Sorry, Dad.

54
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,280
It was my fault.

55
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,440
- I refuse to believe that.
- It was both of us really.

56
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,520
- Shall we?
- Yep.

57
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,960
It was a wet fish shop before.
That's why it's got that slight, um...

58
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,040
Stink.

59
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,200
...atmosphere.

60
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,920
- But that'll go.
- What happened to the fish shop?

61
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,560
It went out of business.
But the area's changing.

62
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,400
The footfall's good,
especially with a match day crowd.

63
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,120
What are you planning?

64
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,520
What are you planning?

65
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,480
Uh, well, it's...
it's sort of a... Parisian deli and café.

66
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,320
Boulangerie, <i>fromagerie.</i> All... all artisan.

67
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,480
You, uh, might miss the match day crowd.

68
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,480
But there's lots of families.

69
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,560
Nice community.
There's nowhere else like it.

70
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,560
Yeah. And with some secondhand furniture
and good coffee.

71
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,640
- Tables on the street in the summer.
- You need permission for that.

72
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,160
A table and chairs license
from the local authority.

73
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,080
I've already checked. I think we'd get it.

74
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,400
It's all... It's all here.
The business plan.

75
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,600
It's all laid out for the next two years.

76
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,360
- For you.
- Ooh.

77
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,200
- It's much the same as the first one.
- Well, I loved the first one.

78
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,560
It's nice to read something
that's not about Stalingrad.

79
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,040
Oh, that's book three.

80
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,560
Yeah.

81
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,160
Well, I'll wolf it down.

82
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,840
Thank you.

83
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,960
- Emma, be honest with me...
- I think it's a very good idea.

84
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,440
- But it's not <i>your</i> idea.
- It doesn't have to be.

85
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,960
I know it's a lot of money...

86
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,720
It's his money. She left it to him.
He can do what he wants.

87
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,880
Hmm.

88
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,800
It's less about the money.
I'd just rather no more blind alleys.

89
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,960
- Is he up to it?
- I absolutely believe he is.

90
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,800
Well, if it means
he'll never appear on television again...

91
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,560
Then it's money well spent.

92
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,120
So?

93
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,000
What do you think?

94
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,160
I think it's going to be very nice.

95
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,240
- "Café Belleville."
- "Café de Belleville."

96
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,320
"Café Paris."

97
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,720
"Boulangerie de Paris."

98
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,080
"Le Petit Boulangerie Parisien."

99
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,040
But how will people know it's French?

100
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,920
- Is it a bad idea?
- Mm.

101
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,080
No, it's not. It's the opposite.

102
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
Am I just gonna lose it all?

103
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,240
You will not. It might even be a success.

104
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,240
Especially if you keep
saying "boulangerie" like that.

105
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,360
That's how you say it. "Boulangerie."

106
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,000
Boulangerie.
Imagine you're booing someone's lingerie.

107
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,640
Which is probably something
you've actually done. No?

108
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,200
Probably.

109
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,000
- What I haven't done is run a business.
- Oh my God. And you will excel.

110
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,640
I absolutely know it.

111
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,600
I might even put some money in too,
once I stop paying rent.

112
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What?

113
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,360
Hurrah!

114
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,120
Do you think we're rushing into this?

115
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,640
<i>It's 15th July.
It is St. Swithin's Day, and great news.</i>

116
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,480
<i>It is a gorgeous day out there.

117
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,040
<i>Come on, get up. Enjoy it. This will help.</i>

118
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,120
<i>It's Gene and "Olympian."</i>

119
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,880
I worry the wedding's too big.

120
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,960
It's 50 guests. That's... that's very small.

121
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,200
I also worry it's too small.

122
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,880
We've pissed off so many people.

123
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,560
They understand.

124
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,240
It's more of a party.

125
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,080
How many were at yours?

126
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,080
Oh God. Three hundred?

127
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,080
I'm not doing that again.

128
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,640
Except you sort of are.

129
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,920
Anyway, it was a beautiful wedding.

130
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,040
It was very nice of you to come.

131
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,720
I had a lovely day.

132
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,880
In fact,

133
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,536
I think it might have been
the happiest day of my life.

134
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,800
All the double-decker buses
and the peacocks and the horses.

135
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,600
Oh God. The horses.

136
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,080
- It's gonna be more intimate.
- Intimate and cheaper.

137
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,160
Let's hope so.

138
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,160
Right, better go open up.

139
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,840
I'd forgotten about the horses.
Now I want horses!

140
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,640
I'm going to try and get back
in time for Jasmine.

141
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,080
Sylvie's dropping her off. So, be nice.

142
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,440
I'm always nice.

143
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,400
I thought maybe afterwards

144
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,000
we could all go out and get a pizza,
or a... movie.

145
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,600
- Did you read this?
- No. I mean, I glanced.

146
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,496
- It's a first draft.
- Okay. I barely read it.

147
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,920
Well, yeah. It's not even a draft.

148
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,960
It's basically just notes.
It's not even proper sentences.

149
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,400
It's not going to be all,
"Thanks caterers and bridesmaids good."

150
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,120
I understand. A work in progress.

151
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,960
But it's all right?

152
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,040
Don't have any notes.

153
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,000
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

154
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,120
Dexter?

155
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,200
Hmm?

156
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,440
"We grew up together." I liked that.

Hi. Hello. Sorry. I'm so sorry, Sylvie.

168
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,000
- I thought you'd forgotten about us.
- Oh God, no. No. I was swimming.

169
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,680
And I got bored, actually.

170
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,640
It's so boring.

171
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,360
Anyway, it's lovely to see you.
Hi, Jasmine.

172
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,720
Why don't you go on in?

173
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,000
And I will be with you soon.

174
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,840
Bye, darling.

175
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,640
Oh well.

176
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,240
Oh, she plays the violin now?

177
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,840
Yes. That's the main reason
we're leaving the country.

178
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,280
- Where are you going?
- Sharm-El-Sheik, Egypt.

179
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,080
Callum wants to go scuba diving.

180
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,440
- Sharm. That's amazing.
- Have you been?

181
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,240
No. No, but I've been, um...
I've been snorkeling.

182
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,920
Well, we're going scuba diving.

183
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,760
Yeah, with the air tanks.
Well, yeah, that's even better.

184
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,120
Mm. So, Dexter's...

185
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,720
He's at the café.
But don't worry. He'll be back soon.

186
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,240
I wasn't worrying. Um...

187
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,600
Look, I... I just wanted to say that, um...

188
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,200
The wedding.

189
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,880
It's very, very kind of you to invite me.

190
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,760
It's very generous.

191
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,920
I hope you don't mind, but

192
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,280
I'm... I'm gonna sit that one out.

193
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,920
Okay.

194
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,280
No, I understand. I'lll... I'll tell Dex.

195
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,800
Like, I'm sure
it's going to be a lovely day.

196
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,120
Jasmine is thrilled.

197
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,760
Well, it's more of a party.
It's not a big deal.

198
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,200
I think it is.

199
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,680
Callum likes to get to the airport
nine hours before.

200
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,000
If I don't harpoon him,
it'll be a miracle.

201
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,520
Um, make sure
she doesn't get to bed too late.

202
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,440
And love to Dexter.

203
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,120
I... I really am so happy for both of you.

204
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,880
Thank you.

205
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,920
Bye.

206
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,440
Yay!

207
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,080
That's beautiful.

208
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,680
I never used to like that song, but now...

209
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,920
Shall I play it again?

210
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,800
No. Let's wait for your dad to get home.

211
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,320
So, what shall we do now?

212
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,360
Shall we do some painting?

213
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,360
Yes.

214
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,600
I mean, the first ten minutes,
I'm this model stepmom.

215
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,480
I'm like, "Let's make coil pots.
Let's learn origami."

216
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,240
And then I'm shattered.

217
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,400
And she's delightful, but she can't spell.

218
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,440
She wrote, "I love you, Emma"
and spelt love with a "U."

219
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,320
Fuck's sake.
I hope you picked her up on it.

220
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,640
Mm. Well, let's just say
she won't be doing that again.

221
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,440
What was that?

222
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,560
Oh, just a living thing
kicking me from the inside of my body.

223
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,520
That's what they're like.

224
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,040
That's why I couldn't do it.

225
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
Yeah.

226
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,520
Oh. Yeah.

227
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,520
Dex is back. Gotta go. Gotta pretend
we've been painting or something.

228
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,840

- Well, I don't know enough about it.

- That's what put me off.
- Well, I wasn't.

- Okay. That's an exaggeration.
- I was bored.

Most of the time, I was bored.

315
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,160
And confused, and ignorant.

316
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,640
And wondering why we couldn't
talk about something else.

317
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,640
Like, I don't know,
family or music or sex or something.

318
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,200
- People.
- Politics is people.

319
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,520
What does that mean?
That's just something to say.

320
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,760
- We talked about a lot of things.
- Yeah. Changing the world, I remember.

321
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,520
Everyone was saying
the exact same thing. Everyone.

322
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,680
Same as they do now.
Except now it's... it's Blair and Bush.

323
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,600
- And then we move on to house prices.
- You talk about house prices too.

324
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,400
- Oh, I know I do, and I bore myself.
- Do I bore you?

325
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,360
- Clearly that is not what I said.
- Do I, though?

326
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,520
Of course not.

327
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,400
Let's just change the subject.

328
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,440
You know what? Let's not even do that.

329
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,040
- It's different for you.
- Why?

330
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,280
You know why.

331
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,920
I just worry we've left it too late.

332
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,200
Well, we've been trying for a year.

333
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,800
- A year's not long.
- A year <i>is</i> long.

334
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,040
Longer than it used to be.

335
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,320
Well then, we'll

336
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,480
redouble our efforts.

337
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,240
Well, if you put it like that.

338
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,000
Mm.

339
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,680
I wasn't so bad, was I?

340
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,000
Mm. No. No, you were great.

341
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,240
Me, on the other hand...

342
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,480
But do you miss it?

343
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,240
Youth?

344
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,120
God, no.

345
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,360
This is better, definitely.

346
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,040
And I love this. Our life. Me and you.

347
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,440
I just, I miss getting excited
about songs and books and people.

348
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,640
Well, there are other things
to get excited about.

349
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:49,560
What if I told you that this place
we're going to see has a breakfast bar?

350
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,280
- A breakfast bar?
- Mm-hmm.

351
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,360
- Like a bar, but for...
- But for breakfast.

352
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,640
Mm.

353
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,400
- I could be happy with a breakfast bar.
- Mm. We should look once.

354
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,720
- Check it's not a normal bar.
- Yeah, I suppose so.

355
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
Hmm.

356
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,000
I'll cheer up by tonight.

357
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,280
I love you.

358
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,720
We'll try again.

359
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,800
Or we'll go and see someone.
Get some tests. All right?

360
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,880
Mm.
