1
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,080
<i>It's</i> Game On!

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,440
<i>The attention to detail is great</i>

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,760
<i>and takes full advantage
of the console's graphics capability.</i>

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,600
<i>Gameplay is fast,
and there will be all kinds of surprises.</i>

5
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,080
<i>But, and as Sir Mix-a-Lot says,</i>

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,240
<i>it's a big but, and I cannot lie.</i>

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,560
<i>The multiplayer mode
is boring and repetitive.</i>

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,960
<i>- Dex.
- Wait.</i>

9
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,240
<i>- Are you sure?
- And repet... Wait. No, I got it.</i>

10
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,400
<i>And repetitive.</i>

11
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,016
<i>- No, I don't. What is it?
- "Undeveloped." You got it.</i>

12
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,400
<i>Uh, yeah. The gameplay is...</i>

13
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,280
<i>The... The... The... Fuck it.</i>

14
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,200
Okay. He's so cultured all of a sudden.

15
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,760
Well, it came free
with last week's <i>Sunday Times.</i>

16
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,600
I thought it might
get me into the right mindset.

17
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,600
What for?

18
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,680
- Daddy.
- Don't call him that.

19
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,640
Obviously, I won't.

20
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,760
To his face.

21
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,160
And don't bother with Vivaldi.
He'll hate that.

22
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,480
He enjoys classical music.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,440
- It says so in <i>Who's Who.</i>
- Everyone says that in <i>Who's Who.</i>

24
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,400
- Do they?
- Yes.

25
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,920
Oh, well, no matter.

26
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,200
I've got a series of topics prepared.

27
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,640
Such as?

28
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,040
- Greek mythology.
- Dex.

29
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,840
What? He said
he studied Classics at Oxford.

30
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,680
Yes, but only because his mother's family
founded the college.

31
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,680
- He is pig-ignorant.
- Oh! Well, what <i>is</i> he interested in, then?

32
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,760
Me.

33
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,440
If I'm happy, he's happy.

34
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,200
Come on.

35
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,200
Welcome.

36
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,840
- Wow.
- Don't say "wow."

37
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,720
Who's that?

38
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,720
That's my great-grandmother.

39
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,680
She looks like you.

40
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,600
Well, she famously had eight affairs

41
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,840
and then became
a particularly militant suffragette.

42
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,400
- Hmm.
- Come on.

43
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,120
There's something else
I want to show you before dinner.

44
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,080
So, this was me

45
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,000
as a teenage girl.

46
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,160
- Game!
- Oh, fuck off.

47
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,536
- They're the twins.
- The fuck is that?

48
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,960
Ignore them.
You'll meet them later.

49
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,600
Right...

50
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,960
So I'm guessing this is...

51
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,960
This is where you lost your...

52
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,200
No.

53
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,320
That was on a ski trip.
To my instructor, Gaspard.

54
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,000
How many boys have you brought up here?

55
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,840
- Not many.
- Hm.

56
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,360
What about Hugo?

57
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,840
Or Hump... Humperdinck...

58
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,560
- Or whatever his name was.
- Uh-huh.

59
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,800
Mm.

60
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,600
So I win.

61
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,160
Oh yeah. You definitely win.

62
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,640
- Game, set, match.
- Oh, fuck off. That was out!

63
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,280
- Game off. That was out!
- Right, come on.

64
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,200
Oh, you're such a swine.

65
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,960
Don't be so wet, Sam.

66
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,240
Fencing. I'm going all in for fencing.

67
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,320
Don't suck up.

68
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,440
Of course I won't.

69
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,080
And don't be a boiled sweet either.

70
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,080
- A boiled sweet?
- Mm-hmm.

71
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,200
- Okay.
- And don't be a nodding dog.

72
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,080
And don't be nervous.

73
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,600
They'll adore you.

74
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,720
- Mm.
- Why wouldn't they adore you?

75
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,640
Come on.

76
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,040
Another mini-break?

77
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,720
These days, everyone's always
off on a mini-break.

78
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,400
- Where is it again?
- Budapest.

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,840
- Oh, lovely. Is this your first time?
- Yeah.

80
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,680
I traveled around Europe a lot
when I was younger.

81
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,280
What do your parents do?

82
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,920
- Mommy!
- Uh, my father is in business.

83
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,480
And... well, my mother's dead now,
but she used to be an antiques dealer.

84
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,600
So she had a shop?

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,440
Bordeaux?

86
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,440
- No. No, thank you.
- You prefer a white?

87
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,480
- Uh, no. Uh...
- Not a rosé?

88
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,640
No.

89
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,720
- You AA or something?
- Oh, Lionel!

90
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,000
- Of course he's not AA.
- Been largin' it for too long.

91
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,560
- Nice one, Murray.
- I'm Sam.

92
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,080
Should it be NA?

93
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,120
Shut up. You're just... having
a bit of time off, aren't you, darling?

94
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,000
God, she hasn't got you
on one of her health kicks, has she?

95
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,520
This is a 1990 Cheval Blanc.

96
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,240
Have you any idea
what kind of a wine that is, man?

97
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,360
Well, it was delicious
the last time I had it, but it's, um...

98
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,920
It's not the '81.

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,480
Oh.

100
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,680
- Oh, he got you there, Daddy.
- At last.

101
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,120
Someone who Lionel
can talk about wine with.

102
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,240
A wine connoisseur who doesn't touch
the stuff. What's the use in that?

103
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,600
Well, I just think that people
can be more interesting without drink.

104
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,480
Same goes for you, Daddy.

105
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,640
The thing I don't understand
about Alcoholics Anonymous

106
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,120
is why it's called that,
when the first thing you do is say,

107
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,560
"My name's Tom, and I'm an alcoholic."

108
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,520
They don't say their surnames.

109
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,400
That's why they can still say
Alcoholics Anonymous.

110
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,880
Ah.

111
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,840
- Do you two play pranks?
- Pranks?

112
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,920
Yeah. Pretend to be each other, you know,
when you're with your girlfriends.

113
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,680
Or boyfriends.

114
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,760
Don't wanna take anything
for granted.

115
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,080
You mean,
sleep with each other's girlfriends?

116
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,440
As a joke?

117
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,040
- Um, well, no. Not necessarily...
- No, we've never done that.

118
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,840
But we do communicate telepathically.

119
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,120
- Really?
- Murray, what am I thinking?

120
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,600
What's the joke?

121
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,360
I can't quite believe that we're
being interviewed by <i>the</i> Dexter Mayhew.

122
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,240
Stop!

123
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:25,040
- Uh... um, I thought I'd turned it off.
- Oh, darling, you should take it.

124
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,760
It's Dexter's agent.
He's been waiting for this call all day.

125
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,720
Sorry. I wasn't expecting him
to call so late.

126
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,176
- Do you mind?
- Of course.

127
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,600
Do what you must do.

128
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,800
Though I thought it was only doctors

129
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,080
and people who save lives
who were on call.

130
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,560
Aaron, how are you?

131
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,520
Mm.

132
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,800
Dexie, I was, uh...
all set to leave you a message.

133
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,400
<i>How are you, buddy?</i>

134
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,000
- Uh, I'm good.
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>

135
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,360
Uh, really good. Uh...

136
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,880
Just at Sylvie's parents' house
before we head to Budapest.

137
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,640
<i>Well, I don't want to keep you, mate.</i>

138
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,480
<i>As you know, I had lunch
with the</i> Game On! <i>producers today.</i>

139
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,080
<i>- They are keen to keep working with you.</i>
- Uh-huh.

140
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,280
- Yeah.
<i>- Okay. What's the offer?</i>

141
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,400
Yeah. They just don't think
it's gonna work

142
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,800
to bring you back for series two.

143
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,520
Uh, huh?

144
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,760
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

145
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,160
Um...

146
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,080
I thought today
was just about working out my deal.

147
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,480
<i>No. No, I know.
It took me by surprise as well, mate.</i>

148
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,640
But why?

149
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,400
Fuck knows. I'm fucking furious.

150
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,120
<i>I... I don't understand.</i>

151
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,960
<i>Me neither. They said something
about refreshing the format,</i>

152
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,880
<i>appealing to a younger audience.</i>

153
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,040
- Well, fuck 'em.
<i>- Exactly. Fuck 'em.</i>

154
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,400
<i>- That's what I said.</i>
- Did you?

155
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,840
Yeah. Well, I told them
I wasn't best pleased.

156
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,160
<i>But look. I don't think
you need to be downhearted, mate.</i>

157
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,920
<i>I think people are gonna soon see
what I can see,</i>

158
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,360
<i>which is actually
that Dexter Mayhew is growing up.</i>

159
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,400
<i>Maybe we just need to find
a new direction for you, you know?</i>

160
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,320
Yeah.

161
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,000
Yeah. Some serious programs,
like maybe a car show.

162
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,440
<i>People love you, Dexie,
but they love you in an ironic,</i>

163
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,400
<i>tongue-in-cheek, love-to-hate kind of way.</i>

164
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,040
<i>And what we need to do now
is get people to love you sincerely.</i>

165
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,760
<i>Okay.</i>

166
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,480
<i>Chin up, though, yeah? Love to Sylvie.</i>

167
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,760
Shit.

168
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,400
Congratulations, Dexter.

169
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,280
<i>Secundo</i> series.

170
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,240
Hm.

171
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,360
Thank you. Yes. No, I, um...

172
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,120
I told Aaron
that I... I... I need to think about it.

173
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,400
But why?

174
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,320
I'm just not sure
it's really the direction I want to go in.

175
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,440
Is it a big job?

176
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,000
- Fairly.
- And he's great on it.

177
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,880
Very informative.

178
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,960
Yeah. I'm saying that, you know,

179
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,640
this whole... this whole genre
that I've been so far involved with,

180
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,040
<i>Get In!</i> and <i>Largin' It</i> and <i>Game On!,</i> is...

181
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,280
That's a genre?
<i>Largin' It</i>'s part of a genre?

182
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,240
Well, they're all a type of show.

183
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,960
- A shit show.
- Oh, Sam, can you stop?

184
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,800
- You used to tell us to turn it off.
- I did not.

185
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,320
I don't even remember it.

186
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,320
"Turn it off
before it damages your brain."

187
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,760
You said it was
like being screamed at for an hour.

188
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,320
I never said that.

189
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,560
"Before you go out..."

190
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,920
"Get in!"

191
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,840
All swearing
and half naked girls in cages.

192
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,360
Well, yes, but it wasn't all like that.

193
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,840
You know, I... I mainly just interviewed
the bands and movie stars.

194
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,200
Oh, the bands and the movie stars.

195
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,520
You still hang out
with a lot of movie stars, then?

196
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,640
No. No.

197
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,480
I... I... I used to
when I was younger, but...

198
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,280
Faddy, isn't it? TV.

199
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,640
Faddy.

200
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,840
One minute, you're in.

201
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,080
Next minute,

202
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,280
you're not.

203
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,600
People lose interest.

204
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,120
- So what's next?
<i>- Panorama?</i>

205
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,120
Possibly.

206
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,400
Or perhaps I'll just present
BBC's general election coverage.

207
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,280
Oh, that sounds good.

208
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,960
Now, that sounds more like it, doesn't it?

209
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,000
Mommy, he was joking.

210
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,320
- Oh, was he?
- He bloody wasn't.

211
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
Murray!

212
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,160
Politicians dancing.

213
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,440
- In cages.
- Can you both just shut up?

214
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,640
Uh, I keep getting
your twin brothers muddled up.

215
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,800
A good way to remember
is that Sam's hateful, and Murray's foul.

216
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,320
I don't think they like me very much.

217
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,320
I don't think they like anyone
apart from themselves.

218
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,520
I don't know. I think they think
I'm a bit of a... loser or something.

219
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,640
Does it matter
what my family think of you?

220
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
Depends.

221
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,280
Does it matter to you
what your family thinks of me?

222
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,080
A little.

223
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,120
Then it matters to me too.

224
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,920
Dexter, you can't put saucepans
in the dishwasher.

225
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,040
You have to rinse them out first.

226
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,560
Mommy hates that.

227
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,080
- You fell over, do you remember?
- Couldn't get up.

228
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,880
Oh, there you are.
We were about to send out a search party.

229
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,960
I was just admiring
your cabinet of trophies in the hall.

230
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,960
Well, that's the problem
with having such a competitive family.

231
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,720
You end up
with a lot of cheap, ugly metal.

232
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,280
Uh, what...
what's going on?

233
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,600
We're playing a game.

234
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,200
Can you guess which one? Truncheon.

235
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,400
Two blindfolds.

236
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,960
Our little arena.

237
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,400
Um, I don't know.

238
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,120
"Are you there, Moriarty?" Of course!

239
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,040
Right.

240
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,160
It's my absolute favorite.

241
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,800
How do you play?

242
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,600
Honestly. I thought you hosted game shows.

243
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,480
Sylvie, you must induct him.

244
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,920
Good luck.

245
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,000
- Come on, Dexter.
- Come on, boy.

246
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,240
- Here we go.
- Are you there, Moriarty?

247
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,680
Here.

248
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,960
Shot!

249
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,800
That has got to hurt!

250
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You got me.

251
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,480
Okay.

252
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,920
Are you there, Moriarty?

253
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,400
Here.

254
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,120
My goodness, that one had power.

255
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,800
Okay. Okay, I think
I'm getting the hang of it now.

256
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,280
Are you there, Moriarty?

257
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,400
Here we go.

258
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,080
Here.

259
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,720
Hit! A palpable hit.

260
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,920
He's unbelievable.

261
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,720
- Oh, better luck next time.
- Yeah.

262
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,720
Right, who's next? Dad?

263
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,680
Right. Hand it over
to the professional.

264
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,960
I'll show you how it's done properly.

265
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,600

266

Okay. You asked for it.

- Here we go.
- Yes.

291

Are you...
Are you sure about this?

Well, we shall see.

Mm. Where are you?

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,200
Uh...

Okay.

Mm.

No, get away.

311
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,000
- Oh my God, she's bleeding.
- Oh my God.

312
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,560
Good God, man.
What the hell were you thinking?!

313
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,600
You didn't even ask
if she was there, Moriarty!

314
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,440
Didn't I? I... I... I'm sorry. I...

315
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,200
Mommy, how does it look?

316
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,600
- Uh... it's really not that bad.
- Oh my God!

317
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,320
- Let's go to the bathroom.
- Come on.

00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,240
Ow!

319
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,200
It really was just an accident.

320
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,600
It was just an accident.

321
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,120
Do you forgive me?

322
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,280
I forgive you.

323
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,320
- Sorry for fucking up.
- Don't be ridiculous.

324
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,120
You were doing fine until you hit me.

325
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,400
They liked you.

326
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,120
- Did they?
- Yes.

327
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,760
As much as they like anyone
who's not a blood relative.

328
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,440
If they had it their way,
they'd marry me off to Murray.

329
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,880
Ah.

330
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,480
Well, you know what they say.

331
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,440
You always hurt
the one you love.

332
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,360
Let's get some sleep, shall we?

333
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,040
Are you laughing?

334
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,160
I'm not... I'm not laughing.

335
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,760
- Ah.
- I'm not laughing.

336
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,280
It's just...

337
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:16,000
You know when something happens,
and it's... it's just awful at the time,

338
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,800
but you know one day
it'll make a funny anecdote?

339
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,880
Well, not... not soon, but eventually.

340
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,360
I was just imagining
describing the day to my friend,

341
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,520
who I know would find it funny.

342
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,200
What friend?

343
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,000
She's called Emma.

344
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,560
- You haven't met her.
- Is there an ex, then?

345
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,920
You're imagining regaling an ex
about how you nearly broke my nose?

346
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,840
No, she's not an ex.
She's just a friend.

347
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,880
An old friend...
who I haven't seen for years.

348
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,120
Anyway, besides the, um...

349
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,680
...the incident...

350
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,440
Besides that,

351
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,280
I had a... I had a great day.

352
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,280
I like your family.

353
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,880
Do you?

354
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,720
I don't.

355
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,200
They were ghastly today.

356
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,520
I really, really like you.

357
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,640
Sylvie, I...

358
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,720
I love you.

359
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,960
Huh?

360
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,320
Careful.
