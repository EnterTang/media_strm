1
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,760
I know what you're doing.

2
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,640
Another week, another wedding
full of people you've slept with.

3
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,440
- That's rubbish.
- Whole chapels of them.

4
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,720
Coachloads coming in
from across the country.

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,560
- That's just not true.
- It <i>is</i> true.

6
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,160
It's not. I... I barely know anyone here.

7
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,840
Then why do you keep looking at the door?

8
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,920
This is it!

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,800
Can you move a little bit?
For goodness' sake, Euan.

10
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,000
God, my dress.

11
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,760
Can you let us out, please?

12
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,520
Child lock, sorry. This car's secondhand.
I don't know how to turn them off.

13
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,800
- There you go.
- Thank you.

14
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,720
Coming. Coming. Coming. Coming.

15
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,360
Oh, shit. Your little feather thing!

16
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,600
Your feather thing's been fluttering
in the wind since Cherwell services.

17
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,480
- Can you just take it off?
- No, I can't.

18
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,920
- It's stitched into my hair.
- Okay. Perhaps if I just...

19
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,800
That's...

20
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,800
No. Stop. Right. Let's go.

21
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,240
- Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
- God.

23
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,176
- Oh, shit. Where are we gonna sit?
- Psst!

24
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,360
Come here.

25
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,160

Oh, if not today, then when?

27
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,160
What's going on with Fiona's...

28
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,040
- Don't worry about it. It got...
- Hey.

29
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,120
- Hi, Mr. Killick.
- Oh, Leon, please.

30
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,960
Hey, everyone.
This is the Rankeillor Street massive!

31
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,520
- Um, Raj and Euan used to live at...
- Seventy-eight!

32
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,680
Yes! And Em and I were at 17.
Nana, you were just across the street.

33
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,200
Oh, and this is Fiona, Raj's wife.

34
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,600
- I'm looking forward to your speech.
- No, not a speech. It's just a toast.

35
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,800
It's just a toast.

36
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,360
- Okay, listen. Dex is here.
- Okay.

37
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,240
He RSVP'd "Yes." I didn't think
he'd show up, but he has, so he's here.

38
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,600
Fine. It's fine.

39
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,960
Right. Well, um,
I would love to stay and chat,

40
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,240
but if you could all bugger off
and take your seats now,

41
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,440
I'd quite like to get married.

42
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,800
Are you all right?

43
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,320

A writer?

Yeah, I suppose so. Technically.

57
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,560
Have you given up teaching?
God, I'd love to give up teaching.

58
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,080
I've not given it up.
I'm just not doing it right now.

59
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,360
I've got a tiny advance, so taking
a sabbatical at the moment. Yeah.

60
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,880
Bloody fantastic.
Well, you look great on it.

61
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,280
People keep saying that.
Did I look terrible before?

62
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,080
Now you sound like your old self.

63
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,960
Raj, I cannot believe
you came all this way.

64
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,640
Well, there's only one Tilly Killick.

65
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,920
Well, there's probably not now.
'Cause isn't she taking Graham's name?

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,960
- Oh. What you talking about? Me, I hope.
- Oh.

67
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,640
Um, Tilly Killick or Tilly Gibson?

68
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,760
Oh, Tilly Killick.

69
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,600
And Graham Killick.
He's taking my last name, aren't you?

70
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,680
She got her man.

71
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,760
She did.

72
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,240
Yeah,
just to piss off the parents.

73
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,320
Oh, auntie.

74
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,720
Bye.

75
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,320
Oh my God. Is that Dexter Mayhew?

76
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,880
Why is he still so handsome?

77
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,080
If there was any justice in this world,
he'd be bald and minging.

78
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,800
I had a thing with him once.

79
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,400
I can't believe
you're still dining out on this.

80
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,280
- Wait, what? When?
- Remember when your mom stayed over?

81
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,240
- Here we go.
- In the bathroom then.

82
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,920
Oh my God.
Was there anyone he didn't shag?

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,200
You really do seem to know no one.

84
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,360
I thought you and Tilly
were old university friends.

85
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,440
We are.

86
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,240
I mean, we're, you know,
more friends of friends, really.

87
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,640
Dexter.

88
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,080
Ah. Cal. Wow, long time.

89
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,240
This is Sylvie.

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,200
Uh, Louisa.

91
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,080
- Were you at Edinburgh?
- Met at Freshers' Week, didn't we?

92
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,240
We always used to knock around together
in London,

93
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,600
until your man here went quiet on me.

94
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,040
- Did I?
- Yeah.

95
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,480
Well, you know,
you could've... could've phoned me too.

96
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,760
I did, eejit. You never returned my calls.

97
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,440
Didn't I?

98
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,240
Sorry. Sorry.

99
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,520
Uh, I had...

100
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,000
I had things on my mind.

101
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,760
- It's a long time ago now.
- Yeah.

102
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,440
So how did you two meet?

103
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,136
- Uh...
- Did you see that Emma Morley's here?

104
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,160
Uh, yeah.

105
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,000
- I heard you two fell out.
- We did.

106
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,200
But you're all right now?

107
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,400
Um, I'm... I'm not sure. We'll see.

108
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,320
Did you two ever, uh...

109
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,480
Nearly, once or twice.

110
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,120
Nearly? What does that mean?

111
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,400
Louisa, she seems nice.

112
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,080
Yeah, I wouldn't get too attached.
She's on the way out.

113
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,720
But life's good, yeah?

114
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,320
Dex, I'm 32.

115
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,600
I've got my own house, my own business.

116
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,600
I work hard at something I enjoy,
and I... I make enough money.

117
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,080
I'd say life is good.

118
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,600
What about you, eh?
I haven't seen you much on TV these days.

119
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,560
Um, that's because you don't watch
cable and satellite.

120
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,520
I do a lot of work on cable and satellite.

121
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,400
Mm.

122
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
Hi.

123
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,320
That's him.

124
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,800
And let's do the thing that we do
before we go.

125
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,120
- One.
- Two.

126
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,640
Sandwiches. That's the future.

127
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,920
High-quality,
ethically-minded convenience food.

128
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,160
That's where it's at, my friend.
Food is the new rock and roll.

129
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,560
I thought comedy was.

130
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,520
Well, then it was rock and roll again.
And now it's food. Keep up, Dex.

131
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,280
Everything we sell is organic.

132
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,880
We've got four branches,
and they're full all the time.

133
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,800
I tell you, the food culture
in this country is changing.

134
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,520
Seriously. You should come
and have a talk to me about it sometime.

135
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,160
I think there could be
a lot of opportunities for you.

136
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,440
Cal, are you... are you offering me a job?

137
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,160
Hey, why not? A little apron.

138
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,600
No, I'm just saying, come in and just...

139
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,720
Can't believe a friend of mine
is offering me a job.

140
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,720
Come and have lunch. My treat.

141
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,160
Sounds delightful.

142
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,360
Yes, Dexter Mayhew will attend.

143
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
Ah.

144
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,560
Thank you.

145
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,400
Thanks.

146
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,480
Excuse me.

147
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,320
Do I know you from somewhere?

148
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,920
I don't think so.

149
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,960
Though I suppose distantly
your face does ring a bell.

150
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,280
- You look different.
- People keep telling me that.

151
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,240
- Is that a "Rachel"?
- Christ, I hope not.

152
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,480
A lovely day.

153
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,440
Mm.

154
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,840
I didn't have Tilly pegged
as a traditional wedding person.

155
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,360
I'm not sure coming down the aisle
to a club anthem

156
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,320
can be described as traditional, but...

157
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,120
- Mm, true.
- Homage to Graham.

158
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,280
Graham. "Acid House Graham."

159
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,440
Yeah.
I can't believe he lasted the course.

160
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,560
Mm.

161
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,720
Um... I'd better go.
I'm, uh... I'm under strict instructions.

162
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
That's Sylvie.

163
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,320
Sylvie?

164
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,000
- Will you come and say hi?
- Oh yeah, later. Absolutely.

165
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,120
I just wanna have a look at my speech.

166
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,640
You're making a speech?

167
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,760
Not really. It's just a toast.

168
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,160
Ladies and gentlemen.

169
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,240
Please can you make your way
to your seats? Dinner is served.

170
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,560
Okay, then. Well...

171
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,040
Maybe we'll be sitting
next to each other at the reception.

172
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,400
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

173
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,520
Hey. Have you spoken to Dex?

174
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,160
- Briefly.
- How was it?

175
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,400
Yeah, fine.

176
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,080
His girlfriend is disgustingly beautiful.

177
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,920
- Disgustingly.
- God.

178
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,840
Look at that neck.
I just want to snap it like a chicken's.

179
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,040
I don't know why.
She's actually quite nice.

180
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,520
Ladies and gentlemen.

181
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,800
Speech!

182
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,880
It's one of the great cosmic mysteries.

183
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,000
How it is that someone can go
from being a total stranger

184
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,040
to being the most important person
in your life.

185
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,080
No, Graham. I'm not talking about you.
I'm talking about me.

186
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,680
Yeah. I'm talking
about Tilly and me. Um...

187
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,680
Cast your minds back 11 and a half years.

188
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,400
Edinburgh. First term of first year.

189
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,720
Four in the morning, and I'm woken
by frantic banging on the door.

190
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,160
I get up, afraid, open it,

191
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:58,080
and on the other side is a girl
telling me quite unapologetically

192
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,200
that she's dying for sweet corn
and could she borrow my tin opener.

193
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,920
Yeah. "Weirdo," I thought.
"Definitely avoid."

194
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,960
But it was too late.

195
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,040
'Cause from the moment that that stranger
rocked up with her can of sweet corn,

196
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,560
I stopped worrying about stupid stuff,

197
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,880
like not having gone to the right school,

198
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,560
or not being the Edinburgh type.

199
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:28,040
And instead, I just had
four of the funniest,

200
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,280
happiest years of my life.

201
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,960
And so it was with Graham and Tilly.

202
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,680
One minute she's telling me
about this odd guy

203
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,560
that she's met at this sparsely attended
nightclub in Wandsworth,

204
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,000
who is not even remotely her type.

205
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,200
And why did she give him her phone number?

206
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,360
And the next...

207
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,440
Well, here we are,

208
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,120
at what must be the finest "Grantham meets
Grenada" mash-up the world has ever seen.

209
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,000
One of the writers we studied
in Edinburgh was Dickens,

210
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,080
who we didn't really get that much,
did we? Um...

211
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,000
Apart from this one bit, uh,
from <i>Great Expectations,</i> which says,

212
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,000
"Imagine one selected day
struck out of your life,

213
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,760
and think how different
its course would have been."

214
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,360
"Think for a moment

215
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,400
of the long chain of iron or gold,

216
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,200
of thorns or flowers,

217
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,600
that would never have bound you,

218
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,360
but for the formation of the first link
on that memorable day."

219
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,480
Graham.

220
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,400
I am so glad that that apparently
inauspicious night in Wandsworth

221
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,000
turned out to be the first link
in your golden chain with Tilly.

222
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,240
Because you've made
an already cheerful person

223
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,920
happier than you could ever imagine.

224
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,400
And, Tills,

225
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,400
I adore you,

226
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,400
but any chance I can have
my tin opener back now, please?

227
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,960
To Tilly and Graham!

228
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,560
Tilly and Graham!

229
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,200
She seems fantastic.

230
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,880

239

Is that you off, then?

240
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,040
- I thought you were leaving.
- Oh my God, no.

241
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,560
I just went to change my shoes.

242
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,400
Great speech.

243
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,240
Thanks.

244
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,000
Em, can we go somewhere, just me and you?

245
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,680
Um...

246
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,040
Just for a chat.

247
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,440
Okay. Uh, yeah. Where do you want to go?

248
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,080
Well, apparently, there's a maze.

249
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,520
A maze?

250
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,600
Yeah.

251
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,160
Uh...

252
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,000
Well, why didn't you say?

253
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,320
What if we get lost?

254
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,240
I think that's sort of the idea.

255
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,040
Where's Sylvie?

256
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,600
She's okay. She's being "Callumed."

257
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,080
Ah.

258
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,320
He's doing very well, you know.

259
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,200
So everyone tells me.

260
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,280
- Especially him.
- Hmm?

261
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,280
Yeah, he just offered me a job.

262
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,160
What about <i>Sport Extreme?</i>

263
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,600
- Oh God. Have you seen it?
- I never miss an episode.

264
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,680
You know me. There's nothing I like more
in the early morning than a bit of BMX.

265
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,280
My favorite bit
is when you say things are rad.

266
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,760
- They make me say that.
- "Rad" and "sweet."

267
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,640
"Check out these sweet old-school moves."

268
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,280
- I think I get away with it.
- Well, not always.

269
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,200
- Left or right?
- Mm, left, I think.

270
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,520
- What about you?
- What about me?

271
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,400
What about you?

272
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,800
Let's see. You've written a book.
Got a massive advance.

273
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,280
- You've given up teaching.
- Hang on. Hang on. Who told you that?

274
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,800
- Well, Tilly, obviously.
- Ah.

275
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,600
Which part's inaccurate?

276
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,160
Well, it's not a <i>massive</i> advance.

277
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,200
But it's enough not to work
for a bit till I finish the book.

278
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,040
What's it about?

279
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,040
I don't know yet.
It's still kind of taking shape.

280
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,360
It's about me, isn't it?

281
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,680
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

282
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,600
It's entirely about you.

283
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,480
Working title,
"Dexter, Dexter, Dexter, Dexter."

284
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,680
And that's just volume one.

285
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,360
Well, you look really good on it.

286
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Do I?

287
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,360
Absolutely.

288
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,840
Thanks. Do you want me
to say that you look better too?

289
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,320
Only if you can pull it off.

290
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,920
Well, you do.

291
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,920
Left?

292
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,400
Left.

293
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,640
Better than you did
during the rock and roll years,

294
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,720
when you were giving it large,
or whatever it is that you were doing.

295
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,720
I was worried about you.

296
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,680
Were you?

297
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,440
Yeah.

298
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,560
It wasn't so much the drinking and drugs.
It was more the flat cap.

299
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,680
Fuck off.

300
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,600
Shall we sit for a bit?

301
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,120
Yeah.

302
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,600
From Callum's girlfriend. Want one?

303
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,240
No, thanks.
I haven't touched them in years.

304
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,120
Well done, you.

305
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,680
Yeah, I stopped too.

306
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,120
Officially.

307
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,200
So, how are you these days?

308
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,080
Yeah.

309
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,080
Different.

310
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,160
A lot more sensible
than the last time you saw me.

311
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,360
Just had to get something
out of my system.

312
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,200
And is it out?

313
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,000
I think so.

314
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,360
You know, if you're 22 and fucking up,

315
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,400
you can say, "It's okay."

316
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
"I'm only 22."

317
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,480
"I'm only 25."

318
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,440
"I'm only 28."

319
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,520
But

320
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,080
32...

321
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,400
I screwed up my career
and screwed up with my mom.

322
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,160
- No, you didn't.
- I screwed up my friendships.

323
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,480
But then I met Sylvie.

324
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,720
Yeah.

325
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,440
It's just such a shame
she's so unattractive.

326
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,920
Better yet, she takes no prisoners.

327
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,840
Um, I'm off the drugs. I'm off the booze.

328
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,240
Not smoking.

329
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,160
Special occasion.

330
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,920
So true love found you in the end.

331
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,920
Something like that.

332
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,240
I heard it was curtains for Ian.

333
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,360
- Anyone else on the horizon?
- Oh, don't you start.

334
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,120
What?

335
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,720
Anyway.

336
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,120
I can actually go about
saying I'm a writer now.

337
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,320
I don't, obviously, because that would be
really sad. But I could.

338
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,600
Only downside is everyone thinks
you're good for a wedding speech.

339
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,280
I mean, for today, I wrote my own,
Graham's, and the best man's.

340
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,480
Well, I promise not to ask for that.

341
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,760
Though maybe you can read what I write.

342
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,000
Give it a polish.

343
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,200
I'm engaged.

344
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,120
De...

345
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,720
Dexter, that's... that's amazing.

346
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,240
Congratulations.

347
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,680
Oh.

348
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,640
Oops.

349
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,560
Um...

350
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,520
So you're... you're... you're pleased?

351
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,760
Pleased? I'm destroyed.

352
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,160
No. No. But seriously,
that is fantastic news.

353
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,800
No, it's more than fantastic.
It's rad and sweet. It's old-school.

354
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,920
Well, I wanted to tell you in person.

355
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,480
And

356
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,640
give you

357
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,080
this.

358
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,760
Wow.

359
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,320
Wow.

360
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,680
Now, that is a wedding invitation.

361
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,120
- Is it scented?
- It's lavender, apparently.

362
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,960
No, that's not lavender. That's, um...

363
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,760
Yeah, that's, um... that's money.

364
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,840
Yeah, that is the smell of money.

365
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,560
Yeah. It's eight quid a pop,
which is obscene, I know, but...

366
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,560
...Sylvie loves 'em.

367
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,320
"Mr. and Mrs. Lionel Cope

368
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,480
invite you to the marriage
of their daughter,

369
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,880
Sylvie Abigail Elizabeth Penelope."

370
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,440
"Sylvie Abigail Elizabeth Penelope."

371
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,520
Sounds like a ballet class. "To..."

372
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,720
"To..."

373
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,520
To plain old Dexter Mayhew.

374
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,120
Ah.

375
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,120
I can't believe
I'm actually seeing this in print.

376
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,640
"Saturday, 13th September."

377
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,200
- That's in, like...
- Seven weeks.

378
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,800
It's not too long.

379
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,760
It's what they call a shotgun wedding.

380
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,960
Oh my... Oh my God.

381
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,320
- Yeah.
- You're gonna be a dad?

382
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,240
Fuck me, Dex. Space the bombshells out.

383
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,200
Hang on. You're getting married,
and you're having a baby.

384
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,360
Dex, you're having a baby.

385
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,760
- I know.
- Is that allowed? Will they even let you?

386
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,200
Apparently.

387
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
Look.

388
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,440
- There she is.
- Oh.

389
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,800
Or he.

390
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,200
That's the spine.

391
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,560
Yeah, great spine.

392
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,640
- Hmm.
- Oh, really good spine.

393
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,520
But you think it's a good thing?

394
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,000
Yes, of course it is.

395
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,240
Man, I turn my back
for one minute, and...

396
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,760
Oh God.

397
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,040
Don't sound drunk.

398
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,040
- Hello, darling.
<i>- Where are you?</i>

399
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,000
Uh, truth be told, I'm lost.

400
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,560
<i>Well, how could you possibly be lost?
Where are you?</i>

401
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,400
I'm in a maze.

402
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,160
Yeah, I know.

403
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,480
It's a-maz-ing!

404
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,320
<i>Dexter, everyone's on the dance floor,
and I'm stuck with that deadly cousin.</i>

405
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,080
<i>Can you just get unlost and come back now?</i>

406
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,680
- Yes, of course.
<i>- Who are you with?</i>

407
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,080
Uh, um, there's a whole gang of us.

408
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,000
You know, Edinburgh posse.

409
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,480
<i>Right. Callum's back now.
It's fine. Hurry up.</i>

410
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,720
Bollocks. Uh...
'Kay. We've gotta get out of here.

411
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,000
Apparently, if you put one hand
on the wall,

412
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,760
you'll find your way out eventually.

413
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,520
- Okay, let's do that.
- So, um...

414
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,480
Oh...

415
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,400
Shit.

416
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,800
- Uh, this way.
- Okay.

417
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,320
Music's getting louder. Means
we must be getting closer to the exit.

418
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,200
Can I just say something?

419
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,280
Uh, of course.

420
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,560
I'm a bit drunk now,
but I'm just gonna say it.

421
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,160
Okay.

422
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,880
I've missed you.

423
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,600
- I've... I've missed you too.
- No, but...

424
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,200
I've missed you so, so much.

425
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,040
There've been so many things
I've wanted to talk about,

426
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,480
but you weren't there.

427
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,840
And

428
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,240
sometimes... I've really regretted
just walking off like that.

429
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,960
I don't blame you.

430
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,640
- I was...
- Awful?

431
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,960
Yeah. Yeah, you were.

432
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,440
And selfish and cruel and boring.
So bloody boring.

433
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,560
Okay. Thanks.

434
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,240
You know, I could have stuck it out.

435
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,240
Because it was your mom.

436
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,920
It was... It was losing your mom.

437
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,400
It's okay. I mean,
you... you said nothing wrong.

438
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,280
God, this is ridiculous.
I've drunk too much.

439
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,320
- Your bad influence, as usual.
- Come here.

440
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,760
I'll tell you what it is. I...

441
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,080
Every single day that I didn't see you,
I thought about you.

442
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,320
- In some way or another.
- So did I.

443
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,240
You know, I thought,
"I wish Dex could see this."

444
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,520
Or "Dex would find this funny."

445
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,840
Or "What a wanker!"

446
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,760
And then seeing you today,
I thought maybe I'd got you back.

447
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,240
My best friend.

448
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,880
But all of this,
with the wedding and the baby.

449
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,280
I am so happy for you, Dex.

450
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,840
I really am, but...

451
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,120
But I kind of feel
like I've lost you all over again.

452
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,760
You know what happens when you have
a family. Your priorities change,

453
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,000
and you lose touch with people, and...

454
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,240
- Not necessarily.
- No, it happens.

455
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,840
It happens all the time.

456
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,800
You'll have new friends.

457
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,320
Couples you met at antenatal classes.

458
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,240
Or be too tired
'cause you've been up all night.

459
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,880
No. We're gonna have one of those babies
that takes care of themselves.

460
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,560
You just leave them in a room, apparently.
A little gas stove, some bottled water.

461
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,800
It won't be like that.

462
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,080
Okay?

463
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,800
I promise.

464
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,760
Do you?

465
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,000
Absolutely.

466
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,120
- What time is it?
- It's, um...

467
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,840
It's, uh... It's nearly midnight.

468
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,800
We should go. We're nearly there.

469
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,760
- Em?
- Yeah, Dex?

470
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,160
Friends again?

471
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,160
Yeah. Friends.

472
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,360
Now, let's go. I wanna meet your fiancée.
