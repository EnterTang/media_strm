1
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,880
- Good night, Miss Morley.
- Night, Mary. Have a lovely summer.

2
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,320
Six whole weeks?
I don't know what to do with myself.

3
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,240
Come in.

4
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,640
- Wanted to see me, Phil?
- Yes.

5
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,040
Just a moment.

Your stapler.

20
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,000
It's under the desk, in case
you're looking for it in September.

21
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,160
Thank you.

22
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,320
How was that?

23
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,000
All okay?

24
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,240
I don't know, Phil. You've let me down.
You've let yourself down.

25
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,320
You've let the whole school down.

26
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,600
Seriously, though. Any feedback?

27
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,720
Feedback?

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,040
Okay.

29
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,680
Uh, Phil continues to excel this term.

30
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,120
He responds very well to instruction

31
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,040
and is always willing
to take on new challenges with...

32
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,120
Gusto.

33
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,880
Well, I was gonna say "flair."

34
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,600
- However, his language is disgusting.
- I can't help myself.

35
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,440
One minute,
it's the Duke of Edinburgh Award,

36
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,080
and next, suddenly this filth.

37
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,760
That is your bad influence.

38
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,720
- So it's my fault?
- Yeah.

39
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,400
If you weren't so gorgeous...

40
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,200
I'm not gorgeous, though, am I?
I'm just young.

41
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,520
- Or younger.
- Not that much younger.

42
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,280
- I'm still in my twenties.
- For three more weeks.

43
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,320
You are gorgeous, though.

44
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,160
Also, I have to say, a terrific teacher.

45
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,680
Thanks. That's nice.

46
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,960
No, I'm serious.

47
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,120
The kids love you. The other staff.

48
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,160
I know the exam results
are gonna be wonderful.

49
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,120
And I think, after the long holidays,
we should talk about your future here.

50
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,200
Okay.

51
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,520
Not head of year. Not yet.

52
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,760
Okay, but can we have this conversation
with your trousers on?

53
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,560
Fair enough. Mm.

54
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,720
Six weeks without this.

55
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,480
- Mm.
- Mm?

56
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,000
I know what you can do over the holidays.

57
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,320
Lose this.

58
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,840
Just shave it off. I won't get this rash,
and I'll get to see your face.

59
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,240
I can't shave it off.

60
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,480
Why not?

61
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,120
What are you trying to hide?

62
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,880
What's behind the mask, Phil?

63
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,880
- It's my trademark.
- Trademark?

64
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,280
It's because I've got
too much testosterone.

65
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,160
I shave it off at breakfast,
I look like a pirate by teatime.

66
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,760
And Fiona says
I've got a weak chin otherwise.

67
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,400
- I'll change the subject.
- Okay. Yeah.

68
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,400
Year Ten need more <i>Of Mice and Men.</i>

69
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,240
I will see what I can do.

70
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,960
What's wrong?

71
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,240
Shit! That'll be Fiona. Uh...

72
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,000
- Where are my trousers?
- She can't see your legs, Phil.

73
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,800
She'll hear it in my voice.

74
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,000
Hello?

75
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,000
<i>- Hello, darling. Where are you?</i>
- I'm just finishing off here.

76
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,640
Hang on, I'll take you.
Yep, that's better.

77
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,320
Certainly. I'll call in on the way home.

78
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,080
Stir-fry or pasta?

79
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,440
Are you asking me?

80
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,200
Stir-fry, I think.

81
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,320
Oh no, we've got prawns in the freezer.

82
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,600
In the back, at the bottom.

83
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,400
I'm sure. Last year, I think.

84
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,760
{\an8}Look at the date.

85
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,520
{\an8}No, they'll be fine.
They last forever.

86
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,600
Okay, I'll get some.
But don't throw them out.

87
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,880
Uh, you too.

88
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,800
Bye.

89
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,320
Thank you.

90
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,000
God, end of term
is so weird, isn't it?

91
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,160
Everyone winding down, getting distracted.
All the teachers putting videos on.

92
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,360
- Hope you're not putting videos on.
- Me?

93
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,960
- No. Wouldn't dream of it.
- Yeah.

94
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,840
Um, here. Can...

95
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,400
So how are you gonna fill the time?

96
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,440
Uh, I'll go up to Leeds for a bit.
See my parents.

97
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,360
You are so bloody lucky,

98
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,880
having six weeks
stretching out ahead of you.

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,720
No ties, no responsibilities.

100
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,320
No nothing.

101
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,080
Well, not nothing.

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,360
Fiona's dragging me off
to Corsica.

103
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,800
Up and down. Up and down.

104
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,280
Literally, climb every mountain.

105
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,800
Two weeks with Julie Andrews.

106
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,880
What am I going to do without you?

107
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,600
Good job I saw your car.
Nearly locked you in.

108
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,480
Yeah. Just leaving now. Lock up behind us.

109
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,520
Thank you very much!

110
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,640
Enjoy the summer.

111
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,840
- I would kiss you, but the caretaker...
- No. I understand. I'm gonna go.

112
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,360
Let me at least
give you your birthday present.

113
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,800
Oh.

114
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,960
Oh. Yeah, yeah. Present. Okay.

115
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,480
Best come into the back.

116
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,760
- The boot?
- The back seat. Looks less suspicious.

117
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,800
Clearly, I can't go six weeks
without hearing your voice.

118
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,400
Not sure this <i>is</i> less suspicious.

119
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,960
And I wanted to get you something
for the big 3-0.

120
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,080
No. Hang on. This is silly.

121
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,560
It's quite lavish.

122
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,600
- Oh my God. Really?
- It's all yours.

123
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,080
{\an8}It's top of the range.

124
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,960
You can even send messages on it,
like a little typewriter.

125
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,200
- This must have cost a fortune.
- It did.

126
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,640
But you are worth it.

127
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,400
And I thought I'd pay
for the first two months,

128
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,520
then you could take over the contract.

129
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,640
I suppose
it was only a matter of time.

130
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,400
Don't like it?

131
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,840
No. No. It's just...

132
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,120
I've just lost a bet with someone.
That's all.

133
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,280
Thank you.

134
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,240
Ah, uh...

135
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,280
- I would give you a lift...
- No, that's fine. I need a walk.

136
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,360
Enjoy Corsica.

137
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Oh.

138
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,920
Prawns.

139
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,720
Oh, fuck. Not again.

140
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,000
For fuck's sake.

141
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,120
- You're home late.
- Not sure what that's got to do with you.

142
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,640
- You don't live here, remember?
- Nah. That rings a bell.

143
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,440
You can't just keep letting yourself in.

144
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,560
I thought you'd be home, but apparently...

145
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,200
It was the end of term. Right?
There were things to mop up.

146
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,440
What do you need?
You've got all your stuff.

147
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,120
- Did you forget one of your dolls?
- They're not dolls. They're figurines.

148
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,080
- I'm looking for my passport.
- Why do you need your passport?

149
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,560
- Are you leaving the country?
- Yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

150
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,160
Well, I wouldn't mind.

151
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,720
So, where were you, then?

152
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,200
I just told you.

153
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,160
- Well, I think you were with someone.
- Not this again.

154
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,440
You smell of it. You smell of sex.

155
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,640
That... that's not sex. It's... it's PE.

156
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,160
Are you drunk?

157
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,760
I left my special edition liqueur here.

158
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,680
So, yeah. I may have had a few tumblers.

159
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,040
For Chrissake, give me back the key.
How many bloody copies do you have?

160
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,320
- Fuck it. I'm gonna change the locks.
- It's someone else!

161
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,520
- That... That is the only explanation!
- Oh my God, Ian.

162
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,840
What is this obsession you've got
with me... being with someone?

163
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,680
Why can't you just accept
that we weren't right for each other?

164
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,640
- We <i>are</i> right for each other.
- No. Okay. Okay, yeah.

165
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,600
Good point, Ian.

166
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,640
Yeah, see, I... I thought we weren't right
for each other. But if you think we are...

167
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,600
It's not just me. It's your mom too.
I spoke to her today.

168
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,160
Please stop speaking to my mom.
It's really weird.

169
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,560
She called me! She's... She's very upset.

170
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,040
Either that, then,
or start going out with her.

171
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,920
I mean, why fight it?
Dad'll be upset, but he'll love again.

172
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,200
Meanwhile, take this.

173
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,280
And...

174
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
Ta... Ugh! This fucking freezer.

175
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,880
Look at this crap. It's children's food.

176
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
Here.

177
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,280
Fucking crispy pancakes.
They're yours. I'm granting you custody.

178
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,360
- No, thank you.
- Then why are you here?

179
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,960
- What do you want?
- Right. I... Just... Just tell me the truth!

180
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,000
Like you said, now we're just friends.

181
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,320
You can tell me.

182
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,880
You've got no obligations. Just tell me.

183
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,200
It's Mr. Godalming.

184
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,960
The headmaster.

185
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,000
Phil. Phil, when we're alone.

186
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,320
Yeah. We've been having an affair
for the last six months.

187
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,800
Just about the sex, really.

188
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,600
Tables and school chairs.
Anything that stacks.

189
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,560
Yeah, it's wild.

190
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,440
Except it's starting
to feel a bit sad now.

191
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,680
A bit grubby.

192
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,440
Well, there you are.

193
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,480
Now you know.

194
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,200
- Don't take the piss.
- What, do you not believe me?

195
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,360
- It's not funny, Emma.
- It is a little bit.

196
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,280
Yeah. It's not actually true, anyway.

197
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,840
- Because I know the truth.
- Oh, okay.

198
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,800
Okay, Columbo. Please tell me.

199
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,520
I've got evidence.

200
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,080
You bastard.

201
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,760
- You went through my private things?
- I didn't need to.

202
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,320
So obvious. The two of you just waiting
to get me out the way.

203
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,120
- What are you talking about?
- Dexter!

204
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,320
God's sake.

205
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,560
Always him.

206
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,120
- We haven't seen each other in a year.
- I don't believe you.

207
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,400
To say nothing of the fact
that he's got a girlfriend.

208
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,520
No. Not anymore. I saw in the paper.
He and Suki, they've broken up.

209
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,000
- I don't care.
- As if!

210
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,920
I... I don't care who he goes out with!
We're not even friends.

211
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,400
Oh, is... is that right?

212
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,360
What was it?

213
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,880
Hmm? Oh yeah.

214
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,880
This one's a personal favorite.

215
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,000
"Anything felt possible
in the cool of the Aegean,

216
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,400
tingling from the sea and salt."

217
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,680
What? You struggling to find
a rhyme with "Aegean"?

218
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,240
"Oh, to rest my face
in the hollow of your back."

219
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,880
You read my notebooks.

220
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,920
You've gone through my things
and read my notebooks.

221
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,200
Working on your novel?

222
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,600
You were sat in there
writing these sappy love poems!

223
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,440
This was from years ago!

224
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,040
Never wanted to rest your face
in the hollow of <i>my</i> back!

225
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,400
Your back doesn't have a fucking hollow.

226
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,840
And how dare you
go through my things like that?

227
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,600
Well, what is it you expect?!

228
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,480
I expected some trust!

229
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,560
And I expected you to have
some dignity and self-respect.

230
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,440
God knows why.
All you do is whine and mope and moan.

231
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,480
If you ever turn up here again,
I swear I will call the police.

232
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,520
Oh, yeah? Well, go on, then!

233
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,000
- Call them! This is my flat too!
- Is it?

234
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,280
Why is it?

235
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,120
You never paid the mortgage.
You never did anything.

236
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,920
You just sat around all day, frying bacon,

237
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,760
watching videos,
feeling sorry for yourself.

238
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,880
I chipped in!

239
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,760
Well, it wasn't enough!

240
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,480
It was never enough!

241
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,720
I hate it here, and I always have!

242
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,720
Don't say that. This was our home.

243
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,760
I was never happy here, Ian.

244
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,600
- I got stuck. We both did.
- Why are you saying these things?

245
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,800
- Surely you can see that?
- No!

246
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,000
No. I loved you.

247
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,440
I still love you.

248
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,440
I don't...

249
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,640
I don't know what to do.

250
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,920
I don't know what to do.
What do... What do I do?

251
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,600
Can you just breathe, please?

252
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,640
Breathe. Breathe.

253
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,120
I am sorry.

254
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,960
That was despicable.

255
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,400
To go through your stuff.

256
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,880
I should never have asked you to marry me.

257
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,200
- Was it that? The ring?
- No.

258
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,600
I shouldn't have done it in the flat.
I should have...

259
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,920
taken you away
and put it in your calamari or something.

260
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,320
It wasn't that.

261
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,200
The proposal was lovely.

262
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,360
I would not have thanked you
for the calamari.

263
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,880
But no. It wasn't that.

264
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,320
And it wasn't Dexter either.

265
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,640
- But while we were together...
- Nothing happened.

266
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,000
Well, did you want it to?

267
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,640
Did you love him?

268
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,120
I suppose so.

269
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,480
But years ago, after Edinburgh.

270
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,400
Before I met you.

271
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,880
The thing I feel most sad about
is all these photos.

272
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,080
You have hundreds with Dexter,
and you have hardly any with me.

273
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,320
Well, maybe you could take some now.

274
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,240
- Fucking hell, Emma.
- Sorry.

275
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:39,480
No, it's just you're funnier than me,
and that's... meant to be my career.

276
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,000
You're very talented.

277
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,840
You should do something with it.

278
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,040
- The writing.
- That's meant to be private.

279
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,000
Well, what's the point in that?

280
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,840
Not the poems. They're awful.

281
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,080
But the stories and stuff,
and... ...the stuff about school.

282
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,920
Those little illustrations.
They <i>are</i> funny.

283
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,840
You should show them
to someone.

284
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,760
Thank you.

285
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,560
I should go.

286
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,040
My legs don't work properly.

287
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,680
I miss you so much.

288
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,960
Do you think it'll stop?

289
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,520
I'm sure that it will.

290
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,320
But I can't help.

291
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,480
Well, you... could just change your mind.

292
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,920
Ah, well.

293
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,400
Well, don't ask, don't get.

294
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,160
I still think
you're the bollocks, Emma Morley.

295
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,560
- No. No, <i>you</i> are.
- No. No, <i>you</i> are.

296
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,640
Ow!

297
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,920
God, are you okay?

298
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,640
Bit of physical comedy there.

299
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,360
- Cor, that's very good.
- Thank you.

300
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,000
- Bye.
- Bye.

301
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,680
If I ever get a mobile phone,
you can buy me dinner.

302
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,680
<i>I give you six months
before you cave.</i>

303
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,960
<i>- Hey, it's Tilly.
- And Graham.</i>

304
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,720
<i>We're not here,
so leave a message.</i>

305
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,680
Uh, hi. It's me.

306
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,080
I'm speaking to you
from my brand-new mobile device.

307
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,320
Um, I'm at home.

308
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,520
Of course, I'm on a mobile,
so I could be anywhere.

309
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,600
But no. I'm... I'm at home. Um...

310
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,720
<i>School's out for summer.</i>

311
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,280
<i>Six weeks.</i>

312
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,800
<i>Yeah, I get
a whole six weeks of freedom.</i>

313
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,000
<i>Maybe I'll take myself somewhere.</i>

314
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,200
<i>Club Tropicana,
drinks are free.</i>

315
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,000
<i>Or some sort of cruise.</i>

316
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,360
<i>Um...</i>

317
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,320
<i>Yeah, anyway,
I hope you and Graham are well.</i>

318
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,400
<i>I'll have to come and see you soon,
while I'm free of the school shackles.</i>

319
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,440
<i>Miss you.</i>

320
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,360
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Miss Morley?

321
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,520
Miss Morley?

322
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,880
Miss Morley?

323
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,600
Miss Morley, is that you?

324
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,320
Oh. Oh my God!

325
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,920
Sonya Richards, hello.

326
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,480
Some boys gave me this to hold,
then ran away.

327
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,720
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

328
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,360
Uh, you're at college.

329
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,720
I'm so pleased. Is it amazing?

330
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,680
- It's great. One more year.
- And then?

331
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,160
- Uh, university, hopefully.
- Wow.

332
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,680
English at Edinburgh.

333
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,160
If they take me.

334
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,920
- Oh, they'd be lucky to have you.
- If I do, it'll be because of you.

335
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,960
Uh, I'd... I'd better...

336
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,200
Well, it's... it's lovely to see you.
