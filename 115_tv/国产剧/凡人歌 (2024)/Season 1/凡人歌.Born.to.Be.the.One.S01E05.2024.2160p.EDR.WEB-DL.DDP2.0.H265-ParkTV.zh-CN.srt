00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,120
- Dex, I'm done.
- No, no. Wait.

14
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,640
- Let me tell you a secret about Cal.
- Dex.

15
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,840
He didn't get a shag
until he was 22.

16
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,040
Don't be a dick.

17
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,200
Yeah.

18
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,920
Look at him now!

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,240
- I'm off.
- No, wait. What time is it?

20
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,720
You're a state.

21
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,120

27
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,840
Mom?

28
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,080
Hello, hello.
I hope you started without me.

29
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,280
Started? You're three hours late.

30
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,640
You're sweating.

31
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,200
Blame Prada.

32
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,040
It's synthetic fibers.

33
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,720
Present.

34
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,800
What beautiful wrapping.

35
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,960
Well, it's not me, I'm afraid.

36
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,800
No. Yours come in plastic bags,
when they come at all.

37
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,680
- It's from Emma.
- Lovely Emma Morley?

38
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,960
- How is she?
- Good.

39
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,960
Yeah. She's just got her own little place.

40
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,760
It's tiny.

41
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,440
She's out all the time.

42
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,320
New friends.

43
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,560
Cultured evenings.

44
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,880
- But you're still friends?
- Course.

45
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,840
Well, do thank her for me.

46
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,760
Although you might want
to steer her towards short stories.

47
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,840
Mom.

48
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,560
And what about you?

49
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,800
- Are you happy?
- I'm having a marvelous time.

50
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,280
- That's not what I asked.
- Look, life is good.

51
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,480
I present a television show, Mother.
I know you never watch it.

52
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,120
I <i>have</i> watched it.

53
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,280
I watched it last week, in fact.

54
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,920
Did you?

55
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,320
And what did you think?

56
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,560
What do you want me to say, Dexter?

57
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,120
I don't care for the program.

58
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,280
Well, it's not for people like you, is it?

59
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,680
I just don't understand why you need
to humiliate people all the time.

60
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,920
- We don't humiliate people.
- "Britain's ugliest girlfriend"?

61
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,880
It's a silly late-night show.

62
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,960
Post pub.

63
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,280
Don't overthink it.

64
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,200
How about...

65
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,280
I'm afraid the afternoon's
rather taken it out of me.

66
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,960
I'm going to go and have to lie down.

67
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,200
Of course. All right.

68
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,240
I was bright as a button at midday.

69
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,360
As the day goes on, I sort of wither.

70
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,280
I'll need some help.

71
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,000
Of course, yeah. Um...

72
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,560
Uh...

73
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,160
I can walk now.

74
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,520
I just need your help up the stairs.

75
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,440
Oh!

76
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,400
- Sorry.
- It's all right. It's all right.

77
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,320
Um...

78
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,200
- Shall I open the window?
- Ah, leave it.

79
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,840
Oh, it's... it's just a bit close.

80
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,320
You're staying the night, aren't you?

81
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,320
Uh, actually,

82
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,760
I... I can't.

83
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,920
I've got plans.

84
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,640
Oh.

85
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,160
It's a film premiere.

86
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,400
- Princess Di will be there.
- Oh, well.

87
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,640
- When Princess Di calls...
- Yeah.

88
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,160
You'll stay for supper, though?

89
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,560
Six o'clock?

90
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,680
Of course. I'll be there.

91
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,480
Sleep well.

92
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,920
Goodbye, darling.

93
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,280
Oh, you've arrived.

94
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,520
- Where's your mother?
- Sleeping. She was tired.

95
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,160
Where do you think you're going?

96
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,240
To my room.

97
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,320
Dexter.

98
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,120
Dexter.

99
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,400
Dexter.

100
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,280
Dexter. It's time to wake up.

101
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,280
- You've missed the whole day.
- What time is it?

102
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,560
After seven.

103
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,280
I'm afraid your father
is very angry with you.

104
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,920
Well...

105
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,960
What's new?

106
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,760
Are you?

107
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,080
I'm angry
with everyone these days.

108
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,600
Good God.

109
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,320
Did I really wear this?
It's a bit over-the-top, don't you think?

110
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,440
It's beautiful.

111
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,520
Mm.

112
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,680
And you looked beautiful in it.

113
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,840
- Even my friends fancied you.
- Oh, Dexter!

114
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,080
They did.

115
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,480
That's my first tux.

116
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,560
Yes.

117
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,880
You've had everything
you ever could have wanted.

118
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,560
I know.

119
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,120
And you've done nothing with it.

120
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,400
Mm, what?

121
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,680
Money, schooling.

122
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,400
I've not done nothing. Uh...

123
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,600
Uh... I'm a presenter on a TV show.

124
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,440
I'm a celebrity, actually.

125
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,680
Mom...

126
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,040
I think that you have it in you
to be a fine young man.

127
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,600
Exceptional, even. I always have.

128
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,640
But you're not there yet, Dexter.

129
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,320
You're a long way off.

130
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,920
And I'm afraid the person you have become...

131
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,600
is not very nice.

132
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,880
I'm sorry.

133
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,520
Mom.

134
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,600
I love you.

135
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,560
- I'll... I'll... I'll stay tonight.
- No, no, no.

136
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,520
- I will. I... I... I want to.
- Dexter.

137
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,800
Come back next time and...

138
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,080
...start again.

139
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,280
I've hidden them.

140
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,240
You've what?

141
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,960
I've hidden your car keys, Dexter,
because you're drunk.

142
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,040
I... I'm not drunk.

143
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,480
I'm hungover.

144
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,520
That's all!

145
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,280
Why didn't you wake me?

146
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,360
I tried.

147
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,600
Well, you couldn't have tried very hard.

148
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,160
You arrive late,
sleep all day, miss two meals,

149
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,000
and this is somehow <i>my</i> fault?

150
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,880
You can pick your car up
on Saturday when you're sober.

151
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,880
I'll give you a lift to the station.
Come on.

152
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,920
You're a grown man, Dexter.

153
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,480
Your mother loves you very much.

154
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,120
We both do.

155
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:20,880
But in whatever time
your mother has left, if you ever...

156
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,360
...ever turn up
at our door in that state again,

157
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,320
I will not let you in.

158
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,480
Do you understand?!

159
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,760
I... I...

160
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,240
I carried her up the stairs.

161
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,880
So?

162
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,720
I... I put her into bed.

163
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,840
Go home, Dexter.

164
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,040

Just pick up the phone, Emma.

If you're there...

200

Oh. Sorry, can we...

- No, don't do that.
- Ah. I fucked the olives.

Not... Not literally, I hasten to add.

- Chair or banquette?
- What?

224
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,840
I went for chairs, but would you
have preferred a banquette?

225
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,720
Oh no, a chair is fine. Yeah.

226
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,040
Funny word, banquette.

227
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,640
Uh, not really. It's French.

228
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,760
"Bown-ki-et."

229
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,000
It's... Uh, it's just French.

230
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,640
- Do I have something on my face?
- No. No. It's...

231
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,760
No. You just look... You look so lovely.

232

Ah, thanks.

233

Oh.

00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,720
Any drinks?

236
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,360
Uh, yeah. I'd love a vodka and tonic.

237
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,880
Very good. Is that a double?

238
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,080
- Oh God, is that too reckless?
- Oh, proceed, fair maiden.

239
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,520
And for you, sir?

240
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,120
I'll hang on for the wine. <i>Grazie.</i>

Feel a real warmth from that man.

242
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,400
Well, fancy restaurant, rude waiter.

243
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,200
- It's the law.
- You think it's fancy?

244
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,240
Yeah, quite fancy.

245
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,400
- Do you know what you want yet?
- Ooh...

246
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,440
- Minute steak looks good.
- Mm.

247
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,920
Or is that <i>minute</i> steak?

248
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:44,400
As in, is it cooked for 60 seconds?
Or is it just a really small steak?

249
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,280
I'm sure you can check when you order.

250
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,400
How about you?

251
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,280

"Penne for your thoughts."

253
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,960
Idiot.

254
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,920
I got you a beer. You like beer, right?
We can swap if you like.

255

Miss Morley, you trying to seduce me?

256

Mm. I'm trying to sedate you.

257

Stop being so nervous, right?
It's only me.

258

Your old mucker from London's
second-worst Mexican restaurant.

to get that out of my head.

265
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,120
Yeah, but don't you find yourself
doing the steps?

266
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,800
You'd be stood waiting for the bus,
then your feet start going...

267

No. No. Stop. Stop.

268
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,200
And just to be clear,
so there's no arguments later,

269
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,360
we are going Dutch tonight.

270
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,760
- Emma, no.
- It's 1992, for Chrissake.

271

- A woman can pay for her half of dinner.
- Yeah, but you're not a woman.

I mean, uh... You <i>are</i> a woman,

but you're... you're a student.
That's... That's what I meant.

274
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,240
Not for much longer.

275

Oh?

277
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,920

278
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,280
Yeah, good.

279
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,240
Yes!

280
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,040
Would you like a wine to suit the meal?

281
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,160
Um...

282
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,280
Yes.

283
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,640
Uh...

284
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,720
"A voluptuous mouthful of forest fire

285
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,880
with a back note
of exploding toffee apple."

286
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,480
Never anything unexpected, is it?

287
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,560
Flavors of bacon Wotsits
with a succulent back note of giraffe.

288

- Ian?
- Yeah?

Stop.

290
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,840

291
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,120
Mm. Oh...

292
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,720
Blackberries and vanilla, it says here.

293
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,760
Do you like blackberries and vanilla?

294
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,160
I love them.

295
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,520
So you did it. You said
you were gonna do it. You did it.

296
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,480
Well, I mean, hey. Don't be fooled.

297
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,080
There's actually real vanity to it,
teaching.

298
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,160
I'm hoping it's gonna play out
like <i>Dead Poets Society.</i>

299
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,720
Just all adulation
and no marking.

300

- Mm, I don't know about that.

301
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,816
I'm just happy to be doing something
so I can endlessly stop pondering

302
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,960
whatever the hell it is I should be doing.

303
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,480
Sorry.

304
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,280

- No, you're not.

305
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,680
I love hearing you talk.

306
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,000
Uh, so, uh, do you, um...
Do you still see any of the old gang?

307
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,800
- Like Paddy or Scotty or anyone?
- Oh, uh...

308
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,600
- Yeah. Well, sometimes.
- Yeah.

309
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,560
- We have a few pints. A few laughs.
- Mm.

310
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,320
How about you?

311
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,280
Are you... Are you still mates with Dexter?

312
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,920
"Make some noise."

313
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,080
He's, uh...
He's doing all right for himself.

314
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
Yeah.

315
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,520
He's having a bit of a hard time of it
at the moment. His mom's ill,

316
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,600
and he's not taking it very well.

317
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,720
Oh.

318
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,120
I'm sorry to hear that.

319
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,200
Mm.

320
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,480
Well, anyway, that's good, then,
that you're still around for him.

321
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,320
Never really liked him, I guess.

322
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,440
No. I remember that.

323
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,520
Mm.

324
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:48,480
In fact, I... I always thought
he took you a bit for granted.

325
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,760
Shit.

326
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,240
Um...

327
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,920
Was that necessary, Ian?

328
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,080
No, it was not.

329
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,560
Sorry, Emma.

330
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,680
It's, um...

331
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,560
Well, it's... It's none of my business.

332
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,360
No, it's fine.

333
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,640
- Shall we do that thing?
- Hmm?

334
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,400
Or...

335
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,400
Or we could get another bottle.

336
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,520
Mm.

337
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,760
God. I am wasted.

338
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,560
- Are you?
- No.

339
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,320
Not at all.

340
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,000
I could fly a commercial aircraft
long haul.

341
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,080
Ah.

342
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,880
Hey, I'm sorry about all those gags
at the start.

343
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,320
- Mm-hmm.
- It was...

344
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,040
I think what it is, is if you're at school

345
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,120
and you're not smart, popular, whatever,
then one day you say something,

346
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,000
and someone laughs,
you just grab onto it, don't you?

347
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,640
You think, "I'm... I'm shit at sport,
I'm quite short, and nobody fancies me."

348
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,880
But at least I can make people laugh.

349
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Not you.

350
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,840
Other people.

351
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,040
You get a bit reliant on it.

352
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,480
'Cause if you're not funny,
you're not......anything.

353
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,400
I don't believe that.

354
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,440
- What?
- That no one fancied you.

355
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,960
Well, documentary evidence
would seem to suggest otherwise.

356
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,800
Well, I'm here.

357
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,680
Aren't I?

358
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,640
God. Uh, I'm trying to be cool.

359
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,000
But I can't,

360
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,640
because I am just...

361
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,480
quite happy to be seeing you again.

362
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,600
I really, really like you, Emma.

363
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,240
I think you are

364
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,360
the absolute bollocks.

365
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,880
Mm.

366
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,600
Blackberries and vanilla.

367
