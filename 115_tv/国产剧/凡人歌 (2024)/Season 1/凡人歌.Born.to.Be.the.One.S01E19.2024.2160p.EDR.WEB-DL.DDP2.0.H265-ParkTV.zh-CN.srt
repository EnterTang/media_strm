-教授呢　还是吉利安  　　　　　-这还用说

当然是教授  他声音好有磁性
Professor. He had that deep voice,

18
00:02:09,678 --> 00:02:11,178
还有烫得平整的衬衫
Those perfectly pressed shirts.

19
00:02:11,178 --> 00:02:12,388
你也不想想  他在那岛上
Yeah, how do you suppose he found a good cleaner

20
00:02:12,388 --> 00:02:13,118
要怎麽找乾洗店
on that island?

21
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:15,588
我在匹兹堡都找不到

他是熊男
He's a total bear.

27
00:02:25,098 --> 00:02:27,608
罗普先生还是福莱先生
Okay. Mr. Roper or Mr. Furley?

28
00:02:28,108 --> 00:02:30,108
真难选
Mmmm. Tough one.

29
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,608
我选罗普
I'm going to go with Roper

30
00:02:31,608 --> 00:02:33,608
我讨厌别人穿太花俏
But only because I have an aversion to loud colours

31
00:02:33,608 --> 00:02:35,608

36
00:02:44,118 --> 00:02:45,618
你在这干什麽
What are you doing here?

37
00:02:45,618 --> 00:02:49,128
我在第一节课前加个班

00:02:58,068 --> 00:02:59,138
在聊天室看到消息
reading in a chat room last night that

43
00:02:59,148 --> 00:03:00,218
据说会有露屌的画面哦
there's a dick shot in it.

44
00:03:00,218 --> 00:03:01,718
很短  但总比没有好
It's brief, but nonetheless...

45
00:03:01,718 --> 00:03:03,218
屌耶
Dick!

46
00:03:03,218 --> 00:03:04,728

Yeah, totally.

47
00:03:04,728 --> 00:03:06,228
-我去  　　　　　　　-你呢
- Yeah. I'm there.   - What about you?

48
00:03:09,228 --> 00:03:11,228
我不行  我家里有事
I can't. I have family stuff.

49
00:03:11,228 --> 00:03:14,228
怎麽  你姐姐又和前夫打架了吗
W-why? Your sister fighting with her ex-husband again?

50
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:16,738
我爸去世了
My dad died.

51
00:03:21,238 --> 00:03:22,238
什麽
Your dad?

52
00:03:23,738 --> 00:03:24,748
什麽时候
When?

53
00:03:24,748 --> 00:03:25,748
昨天
Yesterday.

54
00:03:27,748 --> 00:03:28,748
我很难过
I'm really sorry.

55
00:03:28,748 --> 00:03:30,248
他病得不轻  差不多是时候了
Well, he was sick. It was time.

56
00:03:32,248 --> 00:03:33,248
但那是你爸
Yeah, but he's your dad.

57
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,758
我说了我没事
I said I'm fine.

58
00:04:03,278 --> 00:04:06,288
要是我爸死了  我会不知所措
If my dad died, I don't know what I'd do.

59
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:07,288
我也是
Me either.

00:04:07,528 --> 00:04:10,228
-他多大年纪了  　　-60岁

61
00:04:10,788 --> 00:04:13,788

- Ancient.   - 60's not ancient.

62
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:16,298
据说现在的孩子能长命百岁呢
They say kids who are born today are going to live to be past 100.

63
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:20,798
你能想像活到一百岁了还做爱？
Hey, can you imagine having sex when you're 100?

64
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:23,798
不  现在我都想不到
No. I can't imagine doing it now.

65
00:04:23,798 --> 00:04:25,308

72
00:04:37,818 --> 00:04:39,318

实际上  他是挺可爱的

耶  他很可爱

78
00:04:48,768 --> 00:04:51,268
而且我可从他身上嗅到Gay味
And you know, I've always gotten this closeted-homo vibe from him.

79
00:04:51,268 --> 00:04:52,298
我打赌  要是啤酒够多
I bet with enough beers

80
00:04:52,298 --> 00:04:52,778
音乐够劲
and the right music,

81
00:04:52,778 --> 00:04:54,278
-我们绝对可以干上       　　-胡扯
-We'd totally be doing it.  -No way.

82

How'd I do?

你看起来棒透了
You looked great out there.

84
00:05:00,278 --> 00:05:02,788
-怎麽回事  　　　　　-骗到你了吧
-What's going on?   - Gotcha!

85
00:05:02,788 --> 00:05:04,788
-你们两个认识吧？  　　　　　　　　 -当然
-You two know each other, right?    -Sure.

86
00:05:04,788 --> 00:05:06,288
-怎麽样？   　　　-还好
-How's it going?  -Okay.

87
00:05:06,288 --> 00:05:08,288
晚上到我家看书吧
Oh, want to come to my place tonight and study?

88
00:05:08,288 --> 00:05:10,288
喔　我要去贾斯汀家
Uh, actually I was supposed to study at Justin's.

89
00:05:10,288 --> 00:05:11,788

布莱恩  你不该来这里的
Brian, you shouldn't be here.

95
00:05:51,328 --> 00:05:52,838
那我要去哪
Yeah, where should I be?

96
00:05:52,838 --> 00:05:55,838
去你妈家啊？  准备你爸爸的葬礼？
At your mom's? Planning your dad's funeral?

97
00:05:56,338 --> 00:05:57,838
其实他算是下葬了
He's practi- cally buried.

98
00:05:57,838 --> 00:06:00,338
看到你的夜生活 风雨无歇
Well, it's reas- suring to know that neither rain nor snow

99
00:06:00,338 --> 00:06:02,348
真让人欣慰

一以贯之可是难得的美德
Consistency's a rare virtue.

101
00:06:04,348 --> 00:06:05,848
特别是在这事事充满变数的年代
Especially in these uncertain times.

102
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:07,848
听着  如果你有任何需要
Look, if you need anything...

103
00:06:07,848 --> 00:06:09,348
-比如跑杂事  　　　　　　　-打电话

104
00:06:09,348 --> 00:06:10,848
不用你们操心
It's taken care of.

105
00:06:56,898 --> 00:06:58,398
你在干什麽
What are you doing?

106
00:06:59,898 --> 00:07:02,408
我来找牌搭
I-I'm looking for a fourth for bridge.

107
00:07:02,408 --> 00:07:05,408
都什麽时候了  还想着这档子事
How can you even think about sex right now?

108
00:07:05,408 --> 00:07:07,908
死亡让我性奋了
Ah, death gives you a real hard-on.

109

老天  布莱恩  你爸爸刚去世
Jesus, Brian, your dad just died!

111
00:07:12,418 --> 00:07:14,418
你怎麽还能想着让别人帮你口交
How can you think about getting your dick sucked?

112
00:07:16,418 --> 00:07:17,918
这是我的悲伤心理治疗法
This is my grief counsellor.

113
00:07:35,438 --> 00:07:37,438
他现在算是你男友吗
Is he actually your boyfriend now or something?

114
00:07:37,938 --> 00:07:40,438
-算是吧  　　-多谢你告诉我
- I guess.   - Thanks for telling me.

115
00:07:40,438 --> 00:07:43,448
你一整年都和一个29岁的老男人上床
You've been fucking some 29-year-old guy the whole year.

116
00:07:43,448 --> 00:07:45,948
我就不能找个男朋友吗
Why can't I see someone too?

117
00:07:45,948 --> 00:07:48,948
-你们在一起多久了  　　　　　　　　　　　-一个月吧
- So how long have you guys been...?     -Oh, about a month.

118
00:07:48,948 --> 00:07:50,948
有一天在英文课的下课时间  我们开始聊起
One day after English class we started talking

119
00:07:50,948 --> 00:07:52,408
《嘉莉妹妹》这本书
about "Sister Carrie" and

120
00:07:52,408 --> 00:07:53,458
是多麽震撼的悲剧故事
how awesome and tragic it is.

121
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,958
很快我们就开始互传简讯
Before I knew it, we were instant- messaging each other

122
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,958
基本上每个晚上都在传
Practically every night.

123
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,958
我们还是最好的朋友吧
Well, we're still best friends, right?

124
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:04,468
-算是吧  　　-不是吗
-I guess.    -Well, aren't we?

125
00:08:08,468 --> 00:08:09,968
你们上床了吗
Have you guys done the nasty yet?

126
00:08:09,968 --> 00:08:11,468
不关你的事
None of your business.

127
00:08:11,468 --> 00:08:12,978
拜托  我什麽都告诉你了
Oh, come on. I tell you everything.

128
00:08:12,978 --> 00:08:14,978
我们只是胡搞了一下
Well, we fooled around some.

129
00:08:14,978 --> 00:08:16,978
他想再进一步  我也想
He wants to do more, and so do I...

130
00:08:16,978 --> 00:08:18,478
我觉得啦
I think.

131
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:20,478
只是他比我更有经验
Only he's a lot more experienced than I am,

132
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:21,978
而我不想像一个傻子
And I do not want to come off as a total freak

133
00:08:21,978 --> 00:08:23,988
-什麽都不懂  　　　　　　　　-先练习一下
- who doesn't have a clue.   -So practice first.

134
00:08:25,488 --> 00:08:28,488
不  据说第一次很可怕
Nah. I've heard horror stories about the first time.

135
00:08:28,488 --> 00:08:29,988
如果男人不够温柔
I mean, if... if the guy isn't careful,

136
00:08:30,488 --> 00:08:31,488
就会很疼
It can be really painful.

137
00:08:31,488 --> 00:08:32,998
那我算是幸运的
Yeah. I was lucky.

138
00:08:32,998 --> 00:08:34,998
布莱恩很温柔
Brian went real slow.

139
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:36,998
所以  我的第一次  想要
Yeah, well that's why I want my first time

140
00:08:36,998 --> 00:08:38,498
和了解状况的人
to be with someone who...

141
00:08:38,498 --> 00:08:39,998
在一起
knows what it feels like.

142
00:08:41,998 --> 00:08:43,008
像是你
Like you.

143
00:08:50,008 --> 00:08:52,008
她想和你上床吗
She wants you to fuck her?

144
00:08:52,008 --> 00:08:53,518
同志和直女
Gay men and straight girls

145
00:08:53,518 --> 00:08:55,518
这不是世界末日的徵兆吗
Isn't that one of the signs of the apocalypse?

146
00:08:55,518 --> 00:08:57,518
你和女人上过床吗
Have you ever been with a woman?

147
00:08:58,018 --> 00:08:59,518
好几次  我14岁那年
Lots of times. When I was 14,

148
00:08:59,518 --> 00:09:00,618
在夏令营
I had sex with, uh,

149
00:09:00,618 --> 00:09:01,518
和4个女孩上了床
four girls at summer camp.

150
00:09:02,018 --> 00:09:04,028
15岁时  我干了我妈最好的朋友
When I was 15, I had an affair with my mom's best friend.

151
00:09:04,028 --> 00:09:05,528
16岁时
And when I was 16,

152
00:09:05,528 --> 00:09:08,028
和我的几何学老师埃尔斯蒂女士
I made it with Mrs. Elstead, my geometry teacher.

153
00:09:11,528 --> 00:09:13,038
没有啦  开玩笑的
No. No!

154
00:09:13,038 --> 00:09:14,538
你这个小兔崽子
You asshole.

155
00:09:14,538 --> 00:09:17,538
那你怎麽知道你做得到呢
Well then, hon, um... How do you know you can?

156
00:09:17,538 --> 00:09:18,858
因为他现在这个年纪
Because at his age he could rub up

157
00:09:18,868 --> 00:09:20,038
撸着一颗树都能硬
against a tree and get a hard-on.

158
00:09:20,178 --> 00:09:23,548
就我最近刚和女人做过的经验
Having recently made love to a woman, I, um...

159
00:09:23,548 --> 00:09:25,548
我可以给你些建议
I can give you a few pointers.

160
00:09:25,548 --> 00:09:27,548
搞一个粗壮的拉子可不能算是做爱
Banging a bull dyke for Jesus isn't exactly making love.

161
00:09:28,048 --> 00:09:29,548
我倒是曾经和女人做过
I've sort of been with a woman.

162
00:09:29,548 --> 00:09:32,048
-真的  　     -十年级的时候
- You have?   -Tenth grade.

163
00:09:32,048 --> 00:09:33,058
玛莎·格伦迪希帮我口交过
Marsha Grundig gave me a blow job.

164
00:09:35,058 --> 00:09:37,058
不过她向我收了5块钱
Well, she didn't give it to me. She charged me five bucks.

165
00:09:37,058 --> 00:09:39,558
她向每个人都收5块钱
She charged every- body five bucks.

166
00:09:39,558 --> 00:09:42,058
真是感人的回忆
That's a... That's a touching memory.

167
00:09:42,058 --> 00:09:43,568
我知道我会帮达芙妮这个忙
I know I'll be doing Daphne a favour,

168
00:09:43,568 --> 00:09:45,068
可是我还是觉得怪怪的
But I still feel kind of weird about it.

169
00:09:45,068 --> 00:09:47,068
她要你帮她 你该感到荣幸
I think it's a real compliment she asked you to do this.

170
00:09:47,068 --> 00:09:50,068
是啊  代表她很信任你
Yeah, it means she really trusts you.

171
00:09:50,068 --> 00:09:51,568
去吧  贾斯汀
Go to her, Justin.

172
00:09:51,568 --> 00:09:54,578
教她怎麽成为真正的女人
Teach her what it is to be a real woman.

173
00:09:55,078 --> 00:09:56,078
就像曾经有人教过你一样
Like somebody taught you.

174
00:09:57,578 --> 00:09:59,578
小心点
Be careful.

175
00:09:59,578 --> 00:10:00,578
不是吧
Oh, shit!

176
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:03,588
看来
Well, you were...

177
00:10:03,588 --> 00:10:05,088
你是命中注定逃不掉了啊
bound to run into him eventually.

178
00:10:05,088 --> 00:10:06,588
为什麽偏偏是今晚
Why did eventually have to be tonight?

179
00:10:08,588 --> 00:10:09,588
我该说什麽呢
What do I say?

180
00:10:10,088 --> 00:10:11,588
要说什麽？  当他不存在就好了
Why say anything? Just ignore him.

181
00:10:11,588 --> 00:10:13,098
我应该去道歉
I should go apologize.

182
00:10:13,098 --> 00:10:15,598
不对  你应该待在这回答我
No, you should stay and answer this.

183
00:10:15,598 --> 00:10:17,098
要莱尼呢？ 还是史奎格？
Lenny or, uh, Squiggy?

184
00:10:30,608 --> 00:10:32,108
嗨  布雷克
Hey, Blake, um...

185
00:10:35,118 --> 00:10:38,118
听着  我说过我没拿你的钱
Look, I already told you I don't have your money.

186
00:10:38,118 --> 00:10:40,118
我不是要说这个
That's not why I wanted to talk with you.

187
00:10:42,118 --> 00:10:43,628
我找到皮夹了
Look, I found my wallet.

188
00:10:43,628 --> 00:10:45,128
在艾美特的沙发上
It was in Emmett's couch.

189
00:10:46,128 --> 00:10:47,628
恭喜
Congratulations.

190
00:10:47,628 --> 00:10:49,628
你不知道当时我的感觉
You have no idea how horrible...

191
00:10:49,628 --> 00:10:52,128
简直糟透了
Uh, really horrible I feel.

192
00:10:54,638 --> 00:10:57,138
我知道你现在过得不好
Look, I know you're going through a tough time...

193
00:10:57,138 --> 00:10:59,138
我也知道  在我这麽做以後
Right now, and I realize that after what I did,

194
00:10:59,638 --> 00:11:01,138
你已没理由再相信我  但是
you've got no reason to believe me, but...

195
00:11:03,148 --> 00:11:05,148
如果你有任何需要
If you need anything...

196
00:11:07,148 --> 00:11:09,148
比如  想要一个倾听者  或是
Well, a sympa- thetic ear or...

197
00:11:11,148 --> 00:11:13,158
一个可以哭泣的肩膀  或是
a shoulder to cry on or...

198
00:11:13,158 --> 00:11:14,658
一双客观的眼睛
an objective eye...

199
00:11:17,158 --> 00:11:18,658
那直接拳打脚踢怎麽样
How about throwing in an arm and a leg?

200
00:11:22,158 --> 00:11:24,168
也可以啊
Well, that too...

201
00:11:25,668 --> 00:11:26,668
如果你想要的话
If you want 'em.

202
00:11:32,168 --> 00:11:33,178
就这样吧
All right.

203
00:11:53,698 --> 00:11:55,198
很好  他就穿这个下葬吧
Yeah, this is the one he should be buried in.

204
00:11:56,698 --> 00:11:58,698
破烂乏味  就像他本人
Worn out and dreary, just like him.

205
00:11:58,698 --> 00:12:01,698
你是不是要先拿给你姐看看
Well, do you think you should run it by your sister first?

206
00:12:01,698 --> 00:12:04,208
她要是看到这件又丑又旧的衣服
Hmm, she'd probably see this ugly, old suit

207
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,208
肯定会哭出来
and start crying again.

208
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,208
至少她知道怎麽发泄情感
Well at least she's expressing how she feels.

209
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,708
她只是想引起注意
She's milking it for attention.

210
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,208
-别这麽愤世嫉俗  　　-Claire是个臭婊子
- Don't be cynical.  - Claire is a cunt.

211
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:15,218
爸爸受不了她  她老公受不了她
Dad couldn't even stand her. Her husband couldn't stand her.

212
00:12:15,218 --> 00:12:17,218
就连她两个儿子也受不了她
Her fucking kids... can't stand her.

213
00:12:17,218 --> 00:12:20,718
既然她那麽没用
So while she's busy being a basket case,

214
00:12:20,718 --> 00:12:22,218
就只好由我来处理这一切
I'm stuck doing everything else,

215
00:12:22,218 --> 00:12:24,728
殡仪馆  墓地
The funeral home, the cemetery...

216
00:12:24,728 --> 00:12:26,228
还有讣文
the obituary.

217
00:12:26,228 --> 00:12:27,728
-我说过我会帮忙  　　　　　　-你想帮忙吗
- Well, I said I would help. - You want to help?

218
00:12:27,728 --> 00:12:29,228
那就看看能不能找到一条
See if you can find a tie

219
00:12:29,228 --> 00:12:31,728
不那麽恶心的领带吧
that's not too offensive, if that's possible.

220
00:12:31,728 --> 00:12:33,738
-布莱恩   -什麽事
- Brian.  - What?

221
00:12:33,738 --> 00:12:35,238
糖包还是方糖好
Packets or sugar cubes?

222
00:12:36,738 --> 00:12:38,238
家里要来那麽多客人
We're going to have a house full of guests.

223
00:12:38,238 --> 00:12:39,738
我不知道大家喜欢什麽
I don't know what people prefer.

224
00:12:39,738 --> 00:12:42,238
我觉得没人会在意这个
I'm sure no one gives a shit.

225
00:12:42,748 --> 00:12:45,248
我妈妈说  通常人们用餐时
Um... My mom says that people

226
00:12:45,248 --> 00:12:47,248
喜欢三合一的糖包
at the diner prefer packets three to one

227
00:12:47,248 --> 00:12:49,748
因为方糖是分开包的
Because the... the... the cubes are individually wrapped,

228
00:12:49,748 --> 00:12:51,248
要是掉在地上了  人们踩上去
and they fall on the floor and people step...

229
00:12:51,248 --> 00:12:52,248
你妈妈最近好吗  迈克
How is your mother, Michael?

230
00:12:53,758 --> 00:12:55,758
她很好  肯尼太太  谢谢您
She's fine, Mrs. Kinney, thank you.

231
00:12:56,758 --> 00:12:59,258
她总是那麽有个性
She was always such a... character.

232
00:12:59,258 --> 00:13:01,258
请替我谢谢她的
Please remember to th-thank her for the...

233
00:13:01,258 --> 00:13:03,268
三明治总汇盘
um, sandwich platter.

234
00:13:03,268 --> 00:13:04,768
我会的
Ah, I will. And, uh...

235
00:13:04,768 --> 00:13:06,818
我很遗憾您丈夫去世了
I have to say I'm sorry for your loss.

236
00:13:06,818 --> 00:13:08,268
谢谢你  迈克
Thank you, Michael.

237
00:13:08,768 --> 00:13:11,268
布莱恩  看到什麽你想要的
Uh, Brian, if you see anything you want,

238
00:13:11,268 --> 00:13:13,278
就带走吧  我打给慈善机构了
just please take it. I've called the goodwill

239
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:14,938
他们明天就来
and they're coming tomorrow.

240
00:13:14,938 --> 00:13:15,778
这麽快
That was quick.

241
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:18,278
我受不了东西堆得到处都是
Well, I don't like seeing things lying around, you know that.

242
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:26,788
比起和我在一起  显然你爸更喜欢这些玩意儿
Your father spent more weekends with that than he did with me.

243
00:13:29,288 --> 00:13:32,288
糖包是吧  好  决定了
Packets. Good. Well, that's decided.

244
00:13:40,298 --> 00:13:42,798
我都不记得在你房间是什麽感觉了
I forgot what it was like at your house.

245
00:13:43,308 --> 00:13:45,308
是啊  所以我总赖在你家
Yeah, that's why I was always over at yours.

246
00:13:59,818 --> 00:14:01,818
有个家伙在我床上吐
A guy threw up on my bed.

247
00:14:01,818 --> 00:14:04,328
-什麽    -我现在住的地方
-What?   -The place where I'm staying.

248
00:14:04,328 --> 00:14:08,328
我今天回去  那些讨厌的混蛋
I... went back there tonight and some tweaked- out asshole...

249
00:14:08,328 --> 00:14:09,328
吐了我一床上
barfed on my bed.

250
00:14:09,828 --> 00:14:10,328
真糟糕
How horrible.

251
00:14:11,828 --> 00:14:13,338
我没法在那住下去了  我
I can't stay there any more. I...

252
00:14:13,338 --> 00:14:14,838
-我真的不能  　　-我没怪你
-I just can't.   -I don't blame you.

253
00:14:16,838 --> 00:14:19,838
我想到你之前说的
Then I thought of what you said, um...

254
00:14:19,838 --> 00:14:21,838
任何事都可以找你帮忙
That I could count on you for anything.

255
00:14:21,838 --> 00:14:22,848
所以你就来这了
So you came here?

256
00:14:23,848 --> 00:14:25,848
我没其他地方可去
I didn't know where else to go.

257
00:14:26,348 --> 00:14:26,848
我很高兴你能来
I'm glad you did.

258
00:14:28,348 --> 00:14:30,348
进来吧
Well, come in.

259
00:14:33,358 --> 00:14:35,358
-你确定吗  　-我很确定
- You sure?  - Sure I'm sure.

260
00:14:37,858 --> 00:14:40,358
欢迎今晚你来住  想的话
You're welcome to stay here tonight, or...

261
00:14:40,358 --> 00:14:41,358
还可以多住几晚
a couple of nights.

262
00:14:43,868 --> 00:14:45,868
行李带了吗
Did you bring your stuff?

263
00:14:46,368 --> 00:14:48,868
嗯　　轻装旅行最好
Well, it's always good to travel light.

264
00:14:50,868 --> 00:14:51,868
快进来
Come on.

265
00:14:53,878 --> 00:14:55,878
我只是想告诉你  我发誓我戒了
I just want you to know, I'm clean. I swear.

266
00:14:56,378 --> 00:14:56,878
我相信你
I believe you.

267
00:15:00,378 --> 00:15:01,378
谢谢
Thanks.

268
00:15:16,398 --> 00:15:19,398
慢着
Um... Look...

269
00:15:22,908 --> 00:15:23,908
我们
Let's, uh...

270
00:15:25,408 --> 00:15:28,908
我们不急着做这个  好吗
Let's not... rush into this, okay?

271
00:15:28,908 --> 00:15:32,408
我是说  我们都需要时间来
I mean, we both need time to, uh...

272
00:15:32,408 --> 00:15:34,418
体会...还有
Comprehend and to, uh...

273
00:15:34,418 --> 00:15:37,918
处理好我们的感受
process how we feel. Hmm?

274
00:15:41,418 --> 00:15:44,428
就是说  我觉得应该
That said, I think it would be...

275
00:15:44,428 --> 00:15:47,428
更恰当地  还有
More... appropriate, not to mention...

276
00:15:47,928 --> 00:15:52,428
负责任地  让我们俩
Responsible... for both of us to, uh...

277
00:15:52,428 --> 00:15:53,438
管他的
Oh, fuck it!

278
00:16:03,948 --> 00:16:08,948
铭记於心  吾等终将归於尘土
Let us remember that we are dust, and we will return to dust.

279
00:16:10,448 --> 00:16:14,458
全能的主  您的儿子死於十字架上
Almighty god, through the death of your son on the cross,

280
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,458
而正是如此  您已为我们征服了死亡
you have overcome death for us.

281
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,458
藉由埋葬和重生
Through his burial and resurrection from the dead,

282
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,468
您已将墓园变成了圣地
you have made the grave a holy place,

283
00:16:23,468 --> 00:16:25,968
并给予我们永生
and restored to us eternal life.

284
00:16:28,968 --> 00:16:31,968
我们为信耶稣的逝者祈祷
We pray for those who died believing in Jesus,

285
00:16:33,478 --> 00:16:36,978
祈祷他能在主的世界重生
and are buried with him in the hope of rising again.

286
00:16:39,978 --> 00:16:42,478
世间万般神灵
God of the living and the dead,

287
00:16:42,478 --> 00:16:45,988
祝福世间所有虔诚的信徒
may those who faithfully believed in you on earth

288
00:16:45,988 --> 00:16:48,488
愿你们在天堂永远快乐
praise you forever in the joy of heaven.

289
00:16:50,988 --> 00:16:54,498
以圣子耶稣的名义
We ask this in the name of Jesus the Lord...

290
00:16:56,498 --> 00:16:57,998
阿门
Amen.

291
00:16:57,998 --> 00:16:59,998
阿门
Amen.

292
00:17:01,498 --> 00:17:06,008
仁慈的上帝  愿杰克和所有死去的虔诚信徒
Through the mercy of god, may Jack and all the faithful departed

293
00:17:06,008 --> 00:17:07,788
都能安息
Rest in the peace of Christ.

294
00:17:09,508 --> 00:17:10,508
阿门
Amen.

295
00:17:14,518 --> 00:17:16,518
在重生的曙光中
In the hope of the resurrection,

296
00:17:17,018 --> 00:17:20,518
让我们的弟兄杰克·肯尼安息吧
Let us leave our brother Jack Kinney to rest in peace.

297
00:17:22,018 --> 00:17:25,528
以圣父圣子之名
In the name of the father and of the son.

298
00:17:28,028 --> 00:17:29,528
阿门
Amen.

299
00:17:43,548 --> 00:17:46,048
克莱尔  振作点好吗
Claire, would you pull yourself together, please?

300
00:17:46,048 --> 00:17:49,048
爸爸死了  妈  我的心也碎了
Daddy died, mother. I am allowed to fall apart.

301
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:50,548
好吧  你继续心碎去吧
Fine then, fall apart.

302
00:17:53,558 --> 00:17:54,558
我们能走了吗
Can we leave?

303
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:57,058
我们都在这呆好久了
We've been here for months. years.

304
00:17:57,558 --> 00:17:59,558
你就不能小点声吗
Do you have to be so fucking loud for christ sake?

305
00:18:00,058 --> 00:18:01,558
神父  不好意思
Sorry, Father.

306
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:04,068
为了布莱恩　我们得留下来
We have to stay for Brian.

307
00:18:04,068 --> 00:18:05,068
他一直不言不语
He hasn't said a word.

308
00:18:05,068 --> 00:18:07,068
连哭都没哭过
Or even cried.

309
00:18:07,068 --> 00:18:09,068
克莱尔给大家做了个好榜样
Well, Claire's doing a bang-up job for everybody.

310
00:18:15,078 --> 00:18:17,578
舅舅  包包里是什麽
What's in the bag, uncle Bri?

311
00:18:17,578 --> 00:18:19,578
你爷爷的脑袋
Grandpa's head.

312
00:18:19,578 --> 00:18:20,578
想看看吗
Do you want to see it?

313
00:18:26,588 --> 00:18:28,088
咱们还是走吧
We better go.

314
00:18:28,088 --> 00:18:29,088
我去抱盖斯
We have to pick up Gus.

315
00:18:30,588 --> 00:18:32,588
还有人等我回去呢
And I, uh, have somebody staying with me,

316
00:18:32,588 --> 00:18:33,598
-所以我想...  　　-真的吗?
-So I should...   -You do?

317
00:18:35,598 --> 00:18:37,098
不会吧
You don't.

318
00:18:37,098 --> 00:18:39,098
各位  不好意思
Oh, excuse me, everyone.

319
00:18:39,098 --> 00:18:42,098
我觉得我们应该缅怀一下
Um, I thought it would be nice...

320
00:18:42,098 --> 00:18:44,608
关於我父亲的点滴
if we all shared some memories of daddy.

321
00:18:47,608 --> 00:18:49,608
神父  从您开始好吗
Uh, Father, would you start?

322
00:18:50,608 --> 00:18:53,118
坦白的说  我和你父亲不熟
I must confess I didn't know him well.

323
00:18:56,118 --> 00:18:58,118
他从没来做过弥撒
He never came to mass.

324
00:19:01,118 --> 00:19:02,118
还有人想说吗
Anyone else?

325
00:19:13,138 --> 00:19:14,138
有一阵子了
It... it was a while ago.

326
00:19:15,638 --> 00:19:16,638
我和布莱恩还在读大学的时候
Brian and I were in college.

327
00:19:18,638 --> 00:19:21,638
他说我身上味道很香
He... he told me once I smelled nice.

328
00:19:23,148 --> 00:19:24,148
哦对了  他还给了我一块薄荷糖
Oh, and then he gave me a mint.

329
00:19:36,658 --> 00:19:38,158
我记得
Uh, I remember...

330
00:19:38,158 --> 00:19:41,158
那时候我刚认识布莱恩
Um, this is just after I'd met brian,

331
00:19:41,158 --> 00:19:43,668
肯尼先生带我们去打保龄球
Mr. kinney took us bowling.

332
00:19:43,668 --> 00:19:46,668
我打的很烂
Um, and I'm a terrible bowler.

333
00:19:46,668 --> 00:19:48,668
布莱恩也不怎麽样
So is Brian.

334
00:19:48,668 --> 00:19:51,668
打完七格我们也只得了九分
I think our score was, like, nine after seven frames.

335
00:19:52,668 --> 00:19:56,678
然後  奇蹟发生了
And, uh, then a miracle happened.

336
00:19:56,678 --> 00:19:58,338
布莱恩扔出了球
Brian rolled the ball and it was

337
00:19:58,338 --> 00:20:00,678
像之前一样朝着沟滚了过去
headed towards the gutter like all the rest,

338
00:20:00,678 --> 00:20:03,688
但是突然它改变了方向
but then suddenly it changed direction.

339
00:20:04,688 --> 00:20:06,688
竟然是个全倒
And there was a strike.

340
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:09,188
我们激动得跳上跳下
And we were so excited and we were jumping up and down

341
00:20:09,188 --> 00:20:12,688
没有注意到肯尼先生已经
that we didn't realize that Mr. Kinney had come back from the bar

342
00:20:12,688 --> 00:20:14,698
从吧台回来  目睹了这一切
and seen the whole thing.

343
00:20:14,698 --> 00:20:17,198
他跑到布莱恩前面
And he ran over to Brian and he picked him up,

344
00:20:17,198 --> 00:20:19,198
抱着他又搂又亲
and he hugged him and he kissed him,

345
00:20:19,198 --> 00:20:22,198
告诉布莱恩  他是多麽以他为傲
and he told him how proud he was of him.

346
00:20:22,698 --> 00:20:26,208
当然了  布莱恩尴尬的跑掉了
And of course, Brian got all embarrassed and ran off.

347
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:30,508
那一刻我印象深刻
I guess that moment meant a lot to me

348
00:20:30,508 --> 00:20:31,708
因为我从没有过父爱
because I never had a father and...

349
00:20:35,218 --> 00:20:37,218
我会永远记得那一天
I'll always remember that day

350
00:20:37,218 --> 00:20:38,218
和那个拥抱
and that hug.

351
00:20:41,218 --> 00:20:44,728
迈克  谢谢你
Thank you, Michael.

352
00:20:44,728 --> 00:20:46,228
迈克  这个故事真感人
That was a lovely story, Michael.

353
00:20:49,228 --> 00:20:51,228
是啊迈克  好感人的故事啊
Yeah, Michael, that was lovely.

354
00:20:53,238 --> 00:20:55,238
我也想说说我的一些回忆
It makes me want to share some memories of my own.

355
00:20:56,738 --> 00:20:58,238
那些我们都应该去珍惜的事情
Something we could all treasure.

356
00:21:00,238 --> 00:21:03,748
他知道我妈妈怀了我的那天晚上
At the night that he found out that you were pregnant with me.

357
00:21:06,748 --> 00:21:08,748
他要我妈妈穿上她最漂亮的裙子
He told mom to put on her most beautiful dress,

358
00:21:09,248 --> 00:21:11,748
带她去了城里最高级的餐厅
took her to the most expensive restaurant in town,

359
00:21:11,748 --> 00:21:13,258
给她倒了香槟
poured her a glass of bubbly and then...

360
00:21:13,758 --> 00:21:16,758
他俯下身来
Get this. He leaned over...

361
00:21:16,758 --> 00:21:19,258
对她说  「小琼」
And he said... "Joanie...

362
00:21:22,258 --> 00:21:23,768
「把孩子拿掉吧」
You're getting yourself an abortion because...

363
00:21:24,268 --> 00:21:25,268
「我可不想再有孩子了」
I don't want another fucking kid."

364
00:21:29,268 --> 00:21:32,268
克莱尔  你有什麽要分享的吗
Claire, do you have anything you want to share?

365
00:21:45,288 --> 00:21:47,288
-进来吧  　　　-谢谢
-Come on in.   -Thanks.

366
00:21:55,298 --> 00:21:56,798
把书包放这吧
You can put your backpack over here.

367
00:22:01,298 --> 00:22:03,308
想听点什麽吗
Do you want to listen to something?

368
00:22:05,808 --> 00:22:08,308
喔　随便都好
Oh... yeah, whatever.

369
00:22:08,308 --> 00:22:09,308
随你吧
Whatever you want to hear.

370
00:22:13,318 --> 00:22:15,818
你觉得  要多久时间
So... how long do you think this is going to take?

371
00:22:17,818 --> 00:22:20,318
我也不知道  可能一个小时吧
Um... I dunno. Maybe an hour.

372
00:22:20,318 --> 00:22:23,008
我答应我妈在六点之前回家
'cause I got to be home by 6:00. I promised my mom and

373
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,638
我奶奶今天要过来吃饭
My grandma's coming over for dinner so...

374
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,828
要是你现在不想做
If you don't want to do this then...

375
00:22:31,328 --> 00:22:32,828
不  我想
No... No, I... I do.

376
00:22:40,838 --> 00:22:42,338
你有套子吗
Do you have any condoms?

377
00:22:42,338 --> 00:22:44,348
开玩笑吗
Are you kidding?

378
00:22:44,848 --> 00:22:46,348
我带了点  以防万一
'cause I brought some in case.

379
00:22:46,348 --> 00:22:49,848
还有  润滑剂和杀精乳膏
And, uh, lubricant, spermicidal foam.

380
00:22:49,848 --> 00:22:51,348
你准备的可真足啊
You're really prepared.

381
00:22:54,858 --> 00:22:55,858
我觉得我们该...
I guess we should...

382
00:22:59,358 --> 00:23:00,358
是啊
Yeah.

383
00:23:01,858 --> 00:23:02,858
我觉得该开始了
I guess we should.

384
00:23:05,868 --> 00:23:08,368
某种程度  这也是你第一次
In a way, this is your first time too.

385
00:23:08,868 --> 00:23:09,868
和一个女孩
I mean, with a girl and...

386
00:23:10,368 --> 00:23:13,378
是啊  我们可以
Yeah. We can...

387
00:23:13,378 --> 00:23:14,378
一起来试一下
give it a shot together.

388
00:23:16,878 --> 00:23:18,378
只是完事之後  小芙
Only afterwards, Daph...

389
00:23:19,878 --> 00:23:21,378
我们可别太尴尬
Let's not get weird.

390
00:23:21,878 --> 00:23:22,378
怎样尴尬?
Weird how?

391
00:23:24,388 --> 00:23:25,888
我也不知道  只是...
I don't know, just...

392
00:23:26,888 --> 00:23:27,888
不要那样
Let's just not.

393
00:23:29,388 --> 00:23:30,388
不会尴尬
No weirdness.

394
00:24:16,438 --> 00:24:17,938
感觉如何?
Do you feel good?

395
00:24:17,938 --> 00:24:19,438
很好
Yeah.

396
00:24:29,448 --> 00:24:31,448
说到那个  恐怖的葬礼
Talk about the funeral from hell.

397
00:24:31,448 --> 00:24:33,458
我永远不会忘记
I will always remember

398
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:36,458
他姐姐尖叫着说  「你吃屎吧」
his sister screaming, "You shit!

399
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:37,958
「你混蛋」
You shit!"

400
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:40,458
你看神父在说到和他妈妈
What about Father o'what's-his-face

401
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:42,458
呆在一个房间时候的脸色
carrying his mother up to her room.

402
00:24:43,968 --> 00:24:46,468
他们呆在一起有  一个小时
They didn't come down for, like, an hour.

403
00:24:50,468 --> 00:24:51,968
你觉得这是真的吗?
Do you think it's really true?

404
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,478
他爸爸的话?
What his Father said?

405
00:24:53,478 --> 00:24:55,978
布莱恩总想一鸣惊人
Ah, you know, Brian's always trying to shock everybody.

406
00:24:55,978 --> 00:24:57,978
不过我有点相信
But somehow I believe it.

407
00:24:57,978 --> 00:25:00,978
你能想像  在这种家庭长大吗?
Can you imagine growing up in that house?

408
00:25:00,978 --> 00:25:02,978
他是怎麽活下来?
How did he ever survive?

409
00:25:02,978 --> 00:25:04,488
谁说他活下来了?
Who's to say he did?

410
00:25:04,488 --> 00:25:05,988
这些东西真好看
Hey, these are kind of nice. yeah.

411
00:25:06,488 --> 00:25:10,488
是啊  要是你想浪漫二人晚餐...
Yeah, they'll make a fabulous centrepiece...

412
00:25:10,488 --> 00:25:13,498
这可是精致的装饰
For your... romantic... dinner for two.

413
00:25:13,998 --> 00:25:16,498
我想用我奶奶留下的那件瓷器
I think I'll use that china my grandmother left me.

414
00:25:16,498 --> 00:25:18,498
嗯  很好啊
Mmmm. perfect.

415
00:25:18,498 --> 00:25:20,498
还有那些高级水晶  (暗指安毒)
Perfect, and, uh, and... and the good crystal.

416
00:25:20,998 --> 00:25:22,998
布雷克肯定会喜欢
I'm sure Blake'll appreciate that.

417
00:25:23,508 --> 00:25:25,008
去你的
Fuck you.

418
00:25:25,008 --> 00:25:26,508
最好是
Excuse me?

419
00:25:26,508 --> 00:25:28,508
我说过他已经不吸毒
I already told you, he's not using.

420
00:25:28,508 --> 00:25:30,008
我们能举手表决一下吗?
Okay, um, can I... can I have a show of hands?

421
00:25:30,008 --> 00:25:32,508
有多少人相信  瘾君子不会再吸毒?
Uh, how many people think the twink is no longer tweaking?

422
00:25:36,018 --> 00:25:39,018
-没人     -你错了吧
- No one. - Yeah, well you're all wrong.

423
00:25:39,018 --> 00:25:41,018
不  小泰  是你错了
No, Teddy, you are.

424
00:25:41,018 --> 00:25:43,018
-我了解              -你才不了解
-Believe me, I know. -You don't know.

425
00:25:45,528 --> 00:25:48,028
-你就是嫉妒            -嫉妒
-You're just jealous.  -Jealous?

426
00:25:48,028 --> 00:25:50,528
嫉妒我终於找到一个人关心我
Jealous that I've actually found somebody who cares about me

427
00:25:50,528 --> 00:25:52,528
想和我在一起
and wants to be with me.

428
00:25:52,528 --> 00:25:55,038
小泰  他在利用你
He's using you, Teddy.

429
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:58,538
-吸毒的人都这样        -这不是真的
-That's what users do. -That's not true.

430
00:25:58,538 --> 00:26:00,538
你就是不想让我拥有
And you just don't want me to have something

431
00:26:00,538 --> 00:26:01,538
你没有的东西
because you don't have it.

432
00:26:04,048 --> 00:26:06,048
你跟这世界上其他同志一样
You're like every other fag in the world.

433
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:22,558
你应该道歉
You should apologize.

434
00:26:23,058 --> 00:26:24,068
为什麽?
Ah! For what?

435
00:26:24,068 --> 00:26:27,068
别装傻  他可是你爸
You know damn well. He was your dad.

436
00:26:27,068 --> 00:26:28,068
就算他没有一直善待你
Even though he wasn't always nice to you,

437
00:26:28,568 --> 00:26:30,568
人死後该得到应有的尊重
When you die, you deserve a little respect.

438
00:26:30,568 --> 00:26:32,568
屁话
Bullshit.

439
00:26:32,568 --> 00:26:34,078
要是活着时不尊重人
If you don't earn respect when you're alive,

440
00:26:34,078 --> 00:26:36,578
死了别人才不尊重你
you don't deserve it when you're dead.

441
00:26:36,578 --> 00:26:39,078
不过  你很受人尊敬
Anyway, you were very... respectful.

442
00:26:39,078 --> 00:26:41,078
每个人都被你那小小的回忆
Everyone was very... touched

443
00:26:41,078 --> 00:26:42,578
所深深打动
by your little... memory.

444
00:26:44,588 --> 00:26:46,588
只是你也不记得吧
Only you don't remember shit.

445
00:26:51,088 --> 00:26:52,588
要来点吗?
Want some?

446
00:26:54,598 --> 00:26:57,098
-你闹够了没                           -没有
-Haven't you abused yourself enough?  -No!

447
00:27:03,098 --> 00:27:06,108
那天我打了个全倒...
I got a strike that day...

448
00:27:06,108 --> 00:27:08,108
这个你没记错
You got that right.

449
00:27:08,608 --> 00:27:09,608
我们高兴得又跳又叫
And we were jumping up and down, screaming.

450
00:27:10,108 --> 00:27:12,108
这你也没记错
You got that right too.

451
00:27:12,108 --> 00:27:14,618
然後杰克突然从酒吧回来吓我们一跳
And that's when Jack came back from the bar and surprised us.

452
00:27:14,618 --> 00:27:16,618
但是他并没有抱我
But he didn't hug me.

453
00:27:16,618 --> 00:27:19,118
那只不过你幻想中的理想老爸吧
That was just your "gee, I wish I had a daddy" fantasy.

454
00:27:19,618 --> 00:27:21,118
抱我的是你
You hugged me.

455
00:27:21,118 --> 00:27:22,118
想起来了吗?
Remember?

456
00:27:23,118 --> 00:27:24,628
我还狠狠吻了你
And I gave you a big kiss.

457
00:27:26,628 --> 00:27:29,128
然後他就说
Then that's when he said,

458
00:27:29,128 --> 00:27:30,628
「你们这算什麽  一对小同志吗?」
"what are you, a couple of fuckin' fairies?"

459
00:27:32,628 --> 00:27:34,138
然後我就用力推开了你
And then I pushed you away so hard,

460
00:27:34,138 --> 00:27:36,438
你几乎顺着球道滚了下去
you practically rolled down the lane.

461
00:27:36,438 --> 00:27:38,138
然後我就跑了
And then I ran.

462
00:27:38,138 --> 00:27:39,638
我跑了
And I ran...

463
00:27:40,138 --> 00:27:42,138
然後...  这里真热
And... it's hot in here.

464
00:27:54,158 --> 00:27:56,158
也许不该喝咖啡
Maybe coffee wasn't such a good idea.

465
00:28:04,668 --> 00:28:05,668
待在这陪我
Stay here with me.

466
00:28:08,168 --> 00:28:09,668
好
Okay.

467
00:28:10,168 --> 00:28:11,168
就一会儿
Just for a little bit.

468
00:28:31,188 --> 00:28:33,188
你喝多了
You're high.

469
00:28:33,188 --> 00:28:34,198
对
Yeah.

470
00:28:42,698 --> 00:28:43,708
你在干嘛?
What are you doing?

471
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:46,708
-等等       -我是在
- Wait...   -I'm just...

472
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:47,708
及时行乐
fooling around.

473
00:28:48,708 --> 00:28:50,708
不行  不行
No. no!

474
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:51,708
等等
Wait.

475
00:28:55,718 --> 00:28:57,718
你不是一直想要吗?  迈克
Isn't that what you always wanted, Michael?

476
00:28:59,718 --> 00:29:00,418
什麽?
What?

477
00:29:00,418 --> 00:29:03,218
酒醉误事大干一场  好忘掉你的混蛋老爸？
A drunken fuck so you don't have to think about your dad?

478
00:29:04,728 --> 00:29:05,728
我从来没想这样
I never wanted that.

479
00:29:43,768 --> 00:29:46,768
你吻功真不赖
You... are the best kisser,

480
00:29:46,768 --> 00:29:48,768
易如反掌(手往下)
hands down.

481
00:29:51,768 --> 00:29:53,268
不  不是  宝贝
No. no-no, sweetheart.

482
00:29:53,268 --> 00:29:55,778
那是个比喻
That's just an expression.

483
00:29:55,778 --> 00:29:56,778
把手放回来
Put 'em... put 'em back up.

484
00:29:57,278 --> 00:29:58,778
很好  很棒
Right. Attaboy.

485
00:30:11,788 --> 00:30:13,288
不好意思...
Excuse me...

486
00:30:13,288 --> 00:30:14,798
亲爱的  我...
Lover, I, uh...

487
00:30:15,298 --> 00:30:16,798
我马上回来  好吗?
I'll be right back. Okay?

488
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:18,298
千万别.. 别走开
Don't you... don't you go anywhere.

489
00:30:18,298 --> 00:30:20,798
在这儿等我  好吗?
Stay right there, okay?

490
00:30:47,828 --> 00:30:49,328
打扰一下
Excuse me.

491
00:30:49,328 --> 00:30:50,828
不用了
No thanks.

492
00:30:50,828 --> 00:30:52,828
不用什麽?
No thanks what?

493
00:30:52,828 --> 00:30:54,838
我不想跳舞
I don't want to dance.

494
00:30:54,838 --> 00:30:57,338
我也没打算邀请你
I wasn't going to ask.

495
00:30:57,338 --> 00:30:59,338
能让我们单独聊几句吗?
Would you excuse us?

496
00:30:59,338 --> 00:31:01,338
你到底是谁?
Who the hell are you?

497
00:31:01,338 --> 00:31:03,338
我是艾美特·哈尼卡特  泰德·施密特的朋友
I'm Emmett Honeycutt, Ted Schmidt's friend.

498
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,348
我们  嗯...
Yeah, we, um...

499
00:31:12,348 --> 00:31:14,358
我们有天晚上在这里见过面
We met here the other night, when, uh...

500
00:31:14,858 --> 00:31:16,858
就是你抽搐得昏倒在洗手间地板的那晚
You were so tweaked you passed out on the bathroom floor.

501
00:31:16,858 --> 00:31:19,358
我们还忙着送你到急诊室
We had to rush you to the emergency room.

502
00:31:19,358 --> 00:31:20,858
有点印象了吗?
Any of this starting to ring a bell?

503
00:31:20,858 --> 00:31:22,358
我想起来了
I remember now.

504
00:31:22,358 --> 00:31:24,868
那就好  很好
Good! Good for you.

505
00:31:24,868 --> 00:31:27,368
你感觉好些了吗?
So you... you feeling better?

506
00:31:27,368 --> 00:31:29,868
因为泰德让我和他在一起
Now that Ted's letting me stay with him.

507
00:31:29,868 --> 00:31:31,868
这就对了
That's our boy.

508
00:31:31,868 --> 00:31:34,378
那请告诉我  为什麽你现在
So, uh, tell me, why aren't you there, uh,

509
00:31:34,378 --> 00:31:36,378
不是和他一起
talking to him instead of here

510
00:31:36,378 --> 00:31:37,878
而是在这里和毒贩一起呢?
talking to a dealer?

511
00:31:38,378 --> 00:31:40,878
他  他是我朋友
Him? He's just a friend.

512
00:31:41,378 --> 00:31:42,878
亲爱的
Honey...

513
00:31:42,878 --> 00:31:45,388
别跟我鬼扯
Don't bullshit me.

514
00:31:45,388 --> 00:31:46,888
也许泰德
Ted, maybe.

515
00:31:46,888 --> 00:31:48,388
不知道这些事
He doesn't know about these things.

516
00:31:48,388 --> 00:31:50,388
但是我们知道
But, uh... but we do.

517
00:31:50,388 --> 00:31:53,388
没错  我们知道你是怎样
Oh yes, we know what happens

518
00:31:53,388 --> 00:31:54,898
往你这皮包骨的手臂
once you've injec- ted crystal meth

519
00:31:55,398 --> 00:31:57,398
注射冰毒的
into those skinny little arms.

520
00:31:57,398 --> 00:31:59,898
我提醒过他
I tried to warn him...

521
00:31:59,898 --> 00:32:00,898
但是他不听
But he wouldn't listen...

522
00:32:03,398 --> 00:32:04,408
因为他爱你
Because he loves you.

523
00:32:06,408 --> 00:32:07,908
事实上他太爱你了
In fact he loves you so much,

524
00:32:07,908 --> 00:32:09,908
他相信你是纯洁的  想想吧
he believes you're clean. Imagine that.

525
00:32:11,908 --> 00:32:13,918
-我也爱他          -不
-I love him too.   -No.

526
00:32:15,418 --> 00:32:16,418
你爱的是毒品
You love drugs.

527
00:32:18,918 --> 00:32:20,418
那去找毒品好了
So get drugs.

528
00:32:20,918 --> 00:32:23,418
来  我给你钱都行
Here, I will even give you the money.

529
00:32:26,428 --> 00:32:28,428
离开他吧
But leave him alone,

530
00:32:28,428 --> 00:32:30,928
要是你伤了他的心
because if you break his heart,

531
00:32:30,928 --> 00:32:33,428
我就打烂你这张脸
I will break your face.

532
00:32:37,438 --> 00:32:38,938
不好意思
Now, if you'll excuse me,

533
00:32:38,938 --> 00:32:40,438
我的歌来了
they're playing my song.

534
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:03,968
-嗨    -贾斯汀
-Hey!  -Justin

535
00:33:03,968 --> 00:33:05,468
你来这干嘛?
What are you doing here?

536
00:33:05,468 --> 00:33:07,468
我只是想顺道来打声招呼
I just thought I'd drop in and say hi.

537
00:33:07,468 --> 00:33:08,968
-你好  史黛博     -你好  贾斯汀
-Hi, September.   -Hi, Justin.

538
00:33:10,968 --> 00:33:12,468
你们想吃点什麽...
Uh, can I get you something to eat...

539
00:33:12,468 --> 00:33:13,978
我...请客
on the house?

540
00:33:13,978 --> 00:33:16,478
好的  一份巧克力圣代
Oh, yeah. Um, a hot fudge sundae.

541
00:33:16,478 --> 00:33:18,978
我在减肥  要准备参加舞会
I'm on a diet. I gotta get ready for the prom.

542
00:33:18,978 --> 00:33:19,978
好的
Okay.

543
00:33:21,478 --> 00:33:23,478
你们两个是在交往吧?
I suppose you two are going together?

544
00:33:28,488 --> 00:33:31,488
达芙妮  我能跟你聊一下吗?
Daphne, can I talk to you for a second?

545
00:33:31,488 --> 00:33:32,488
来这里
Over here.

546
00:33:37,998 --> 00:33:39,498
-你是不是说了什麽?       -说什麽?
-Did you say anything?   -About what?

547
00:33:41,498 --> 00:33:43,498
哦  那个
Oh... that.

548
00:33:43,498 --> 00:33:45,008
那个啊
Oh, that.

549
00:33:45,508 --> 00:33:47,008
你又没说要保密
We never said it was a secret.

550
00:33:47,508 --> 00:33:48,508
真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

551
00:33:49,008 --> 00:33:50,508
这有什麽  大不了就是
What's so terrible? The worst that can happen

552
00:33:50,508 --> 00:33:52,508
别人认为你是直男
Is people think you're straight.

553
00:33:52,508 --> 00:33:54,518
再说  这样也不错
Besides, it was nice.

554
00:33:54,518 --> 00:33:55,518
我想跟别人分享一下
I wanted to share it with someone.

555
00:33:57,518 --> 00:33:59,518
这样的话  我想好吧
Well then, I guess... it's okay.

556
00:34:00,018 --> 00:34:02,518
我想也许等你下班  我们能一起做些事
I thought maybe we could do something when you get off.

557
00:34:02,518 --> 00:34:04,528
不行  我还有事
Mmm, I can't. I have plans.

558
00:34:04,528 --> 00:34:06,528
什麽事?
What plans?

559
00:34:06,528 --> 00:34:08,028
就是有事
Just plans.

560
00:34:08,028 --> 00:34:10,028
你没跟我提过
You didn't tell me.

561
00:34:10,028 --> 00:34:11,528
你怎麽不跟男朋友一起出去?
Why don't you go out with your boyfriend?

562
00:34:11,528 --> 00:34:13,528
我们分手了
We broke up.

563
00:34:13,528 --> 00:34:14,538
不会吧
You did?

564
00:34:15,038 --> 00:34:16,538
我越想就越觉得
The more I thought about it, the more I realized

565
00:34:17,038 --> 00:34:18,538
我们没什麽共同点
we didn't really have that much in common.

566
00:34:18,538 --> 00:34:21,538
你们不是有  甜蜜的传简讯时光吗?
I... I thought you had amazing i.m. sessions.

567
00:34:21,538 --> 00:34:24,048
没那麽甜蜜  他拼字都会拼错
They weren't that amazing. He can't spell.

568
00:34:24,048 --> 00:34:26,548
而且後来我们就没话题可聊了
And lately we've been running out of things to chat about.

569
00:34:29,048 --> 00:34:30,548
你和我之间就不会这样
That never happens to you and me.

570
00:34:38,058 --> 00:34:40,058
我坐在那等他几个小时
I sat there waiting for him for hours.

571
00:34:40,558 --> 00:34:41,558
也许他忘了
Well, maybe he forgot.

572
00:34:41,558 --> 00:34:42,558
或者有什麽事耽误了
Or had other plans.

573
00:34:42,558 --> 00:34:43,558
我们本来说好一起吃饭
We were supposed to have dinner.

574
00:34:43,558 --> 00:34:45,068
烤肉在炉子里
The roast was in the oven.

575
00:34:45,068 --> 00:34:46,068
酒也冰好了
The wine was chilling.

576
00:34:46,068 --> 00:34:47,568
桌上还摆着鲜花
The flowers were on the table.

577
00:34:47,568 --> 00:34:50,068
最後我还到附近的
Finally I went out driving around.

578
00:34:50,068 --> 00:34:51,568
酒吧和夜店去找他
Checking all the bars, the clubs,

579
00:34:51,568 --> 00:34:53,068
我...    我找不到他
I... I... I could... I couldn't find him.

580
00:34:53,068 --> 00:34:54,578
事情总是这样
Always the way.

581
00:34:54,578 --> 00:34:56,078
你不想遇到某个人
You don't want to run into someone,

582
00:34:56,078 --> 00:34:58,078
却第一个见到他
they're the first person you see.

583
00:34:58,078 --> 00:35:00,078
你想见某个人  却遍寻不着
You want to see someone, and they're nowhere...

584
00:35:00,078 --> 00:35:03,078
我们能回归正题吗?  拜托
Do you mind if we stay on track here? Please?

585
00:35:03,078 --> 00:35:05,588
-当然    -谢谢
- Sure.  - Thank you.

586
00:35:07,088 --> 00:35:10,088
他都没回家
He never came home.

587
00:35:10,088 --> 00:35:10,788
回家?
Home?

588
00:35:10,788 --> 00:35:12,588
也许你该打电话到警察局报案
Well, uh, maybe you should call the police station

589
00:35:12,588 --> 00:35:14,598
-或者医院            -或者太平间
-Or the hospitals.   -Or the morgue.

590
00:35:15,098 --> 00:35:16,098
真谢谢你们的馊主意
Oh, thanks a fucking lot.

591
00:35:16,098 --> 00:35:17,598
我们只是想帮你
Well, we're just trying to be helpful.

592
00:35:17,598 --> 00:35:19,098
那你们就给点有用的意见啊
Well then would you make a helpful suggestion.

593
00:35:19,098 --> 00:35:20,598
瓦特尼先生  请到19号登记处
Mr. Novotny, register 19.

594
00:35:20,598 --> 00:35:22,098
瓦特尼先生  请到19号登记处
Mr. Novotny, register 19.

595
00:35:22,098 --> 00:35:24,108
叫我了  先挂了
That's me. Gotta go.

596
00:35:24,108 --> 00:35:26,108
你想要有用的建议吗?
You want a helpful suggestion?

597
00:35:26,108 --> 00:35:28,108
别管他为什麽离开  或是他去哪
Forget about why he left or where he went,

598
00:35:28,608 --> 00:35:30,108
只要感激他终於滚蛋了
And just be grateful that he's gone.

599
00:35:31,108 --> 00:35:33,608
我得挂了
I gotta go.

600
00:35:33,608 --> 00:35:34,618
真後悔打给你们
So glad I called.

601
00:35:37,118 --> 00:35:39,618
我终於明白  为什麽喜欢睡沙发床
Now I know why people sleep on futons.

602
00:35:39,618 --> 00:35:41,618
你干嘛不在百货公司买床垫呢?
Yeah, why didn't you buy a mattress at a department store?

603
00:35:42,118 --> 00:35:45,128
琳赛  亲爱的  甜心
Lindsay, darling, sweetheart,

604
00:35:45,128 --> 00:35:46,628
这问题应该让你回答
You want to field that one?

605
00:35:46,628 --> 00:35:49,628
因为我看到广告  这床垫打五折
Because I saw an ad, 50% off.

606
00:35:49,628 --> 00:35:52,128
好吧  为了省那100块钱
Oh, okay. So in order to save 100 bucks,

607
00:35:52,128 --> 00:35:55,138
你们宁愿冒险弄伤自已的背
You run the risk of permanent back injury.

608
00:35:55,138 --> 00:35:57,638
女人真是奇怪
Women are so fucking weird.

609
00:35:57,638 --> 00:35:59,638
这跟女人有什麽关系?
Why is that a woman thing?

610
00:35:59,638 --> 00:36:02,138
除了缺钱的问题  没有男的
Because no guy, unless he had money issues,

611
00:36:02,138 --> 00:36:03,638
会做这种事
Would do some- thing like that.

612
00:36:03,638 --> 00:36:04,648
用力推
Push.

613
00:36:04,648 --> 00:36:06,148
推  用力推
Push, push, push.

614
00:36:06,148 --> 00:36:07,648
女人对性的看法也很奇怪
You get weird about sex.

615
00:36:08,148 --> 00:36:09,148
我和达芙妮上床之後
After I had sex with my friend Daphne,

616
00:36:09,148 --> 00:36:10,648
她变得超级诡异
She fucking flipped out.

617
00:36:10,648 --> 00:36:12,148
-什麽     -什麽?
-What!?   -What!?

618
00:36:12,148 --> 00:36:13,648
你和达芙妮上床了
You slept with Daphne?

619
00:36:13,648 --> 00:36:15,658
她想把第一次给我
She wanted me to be her first time.

620
00:36:19,658 --> 00:36:21,658
结果呢?
Well how was it?

621
00:36:21,658 --> 00:36:24,168
这个...  她还需要练习
It was... she's going to need practice.

622
00:36:25,668 --> 00:36:27,168
虽然我们之前说好还是做好朋友
Anyway, we said that nothing would change,

623
00:36:27,168 --> 00:36:28,668
不过完全不是那麽回事
And it totally has.

624
00:36:28,668 --> 00:36:30,668
我觉得她爱上我了
I think she's in love with me.

625
00:36:30,668 --> 00:36:32,668
那是因为大多数女人不像男人那样
Well, that's because it's not as easy for most women

626
00:36:32,668 --> 00:36:35,178
把性和爱分得很清楚
To separate love and sex as it is for a man.

627
00:36:35,178 --> 00:36:36,678
是啊
Yeah.

628
00:36:36,678 --> 00:36:38,178
我就是一直看不惯男人这点
That was always my big complaint with men.

629
00:36:38,178 --> 00:36:40,178
特别是还是人家第一次
Especially if it's your first time.

630
00:36:40,178 --> 00:36:40,898
你躺在那
And here you are

631
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:43,178
允许另一个人进入你的身体
allowing someone to come inside your body.

632
00:36:43,178 --> 00:36:45,688
你会觉得这一生  这一刻和他如此亲近
I mean, you've never felt so close to anyone in your life.

633
00:36:45,688 --> 00:36:47,688
当你意识到  你就...
And before you know it, you're...

634
00:36:47,688 --> 00:36:49,188
爱上这个人了
Falling in love with this person

635
00:36:49,188 --> 00:36:50,688
他让你有一种
Who's made you feel like...

636
00:36:52,188 --> 00:36:54,698
前所未有  无法想像的感觉
You've never even know you could feel.

637
00:36:54,698 --> 00:36:57,698
现在你明白  为什麽达芙妮会爱上你?
So now do you understand why Daphne might be in love with you?

638
00:37:00,698 --> 00:37:02,198
快点  继续推
Come on. Push.

639
00:37:12,208 --> 00:37:13,008
收到你的留言
I got a message at the store

640
00:37:13,008 --> 00:37:14,218
我丢下手边工作
to drop everything.

641
00:37:14,718 --> 00:37:15,498
而且还是在我们卖场
Right in the middle of our big Q

642
00:37:15,498 --> 00:37:16,718
24小时清仓拍卖的时候
24-hour clearance sale.

643
00:37:16,718 --> 00:37:18,718
这是一年里最大的活动
That's the biggest event of the year.

644
00:37:18,718 --> 00:37:19,718
你的鞋
Here's your shoes.

645
00:37:22,218 --> 00:37:23,218
在听到你动情的颂词後
After your touching eulogy,

646
00:37:23,218 --> 00:37:26,228
我决定要对杰克·肯尼
I decided to come and pay my respects

647
00:37:26,228 --> 00:37:27,728
表达我的敬意
To Jack Kinney.

648
00:37:28,228 --> 00:37:29,728
就在我们创下连续洗沟最多次纪录
Where we once bowled the largest number

649
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:33,228
的那个保龄球馆
Of consecutive gutter balls ever recorded.

650
00:37:33,728 --> 00:37:35,738
怎麽样?  我们为了那老家伙洗一局?
So what do you say? We roll one for the old fuck?

651
00:37:59,258 --> 00:38:02,258
才一个球  不算什麽
That rolls one, almost nothing.

652
00:38:02,258 --> 00:38:03,758
我已经表达敬意  我们走吧
All right, I've paid my respects. Let's go.

653
00:38:07,768 --> 00:38:08,268
等等
Hold on.

654
00:39:18,838 --> 00:39:19,838
没错
That's right.

655
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:21,338
那该死的娘炮打了全倒
The fuckin' fairies got a strike.

656
00:39:21,338 --> 00:39:23,838
该死的娘炮高兴得跳来跳去
The fuckin' fairies are jumping up and down.

657
00:39:24,848 --> 00:39:27,348
该死的娘炮  要好好庆祝一下
The fuckin' fairies are going to celebrate.

658
00:39:48,868 --> 00:39:49,368
-嗨     -嗨
- Hey. - Hey.

659
00:39:52,368 --> 00:39:52,678
你知道
You know,

660
00:39:52,678 --> 00:39:54,878
三色堇乐团(庞克乐团)的新专辑刚到
the new "Pansy Division" just came in.

661
00:39:54,878 --> 00:39:55,878
想听听吗?
You want to hear?

662
00:39:55,878 --> 00:39:58,378
不了谢谢  改天吧
Oh, no thanks. Some other time.

663
00:39:58,378 --> 00:39:59,878
这衬衫真不错
That's a really cool shirt.

664
00:40:01,378 --> 00:40:02,878
和你眼睛颜色很配
Goes with your eyes.

665
00:40:02,878 --> 00:40:04,388
小芙  你都看过无数次了啊
Daph, you've seen it like a million times.

666
00:40:04,888 --> 00:40:07,388
估计之前没注意到吧
Guess I never noticed.

667
00:40:07,388 --> 00:40:08,388
不过现在注意到了
But I do now.

668
00:40:09,888 --> 00:40:12,388
其实  我过来找你是因为...
Uh, actually, the reason that I'm here...

669
00:40:12,388 --> 00:40:14,898
我本来想e-mail给你
Uh... well, I was going to send you an e-mail

670
00:40:15,398 --> 00:40:18,398
不过我觉得还是当面说比较好
But I thought it would be better if I came in person.

671
00:40:18,398 --> 00:40:20,398
你今晚来我家说好吗?  我是说
Well, why don't you come over tonight? I mean...

672
00:40:20,398 --> 00:40:21,898
我爸妈今晚不在家
My parents aren't going to be home

673
00:40:21,898 --> 00:40:23,398
不
No!

674
00:40:23,398 --> 00:40:26,908
我想  在这里说就好
I mean... it... this is fine.

675
00:40:26,908 --> 00:40:28,908
其实  我只是...
Actually, I just...

676
00:40:28,908 --> 00:40:31,408
想让你明白
I want to make sure that you understand.

677
00:40:31,408 --> 00:40:35,418
我是说  我们只是上过一次床而已
That... I mean, just because we had sex once,

678
00:40:35,918 --> 00:40:38,418
并不表示我们现在是男女朋友
Doesn't mean that we're now boyfriend and girlfriend.

679
00:40:38,418 --> 00:40:40,418
我从没说过我们是啊
I never said we were.

680
00:40:40,418 --> 00:40:41,918
你动不动就打给我  几乎一天打 8次
You're calling me, like, eight times a day.

681
00:40:41,918 --> 00:40:43,918
我才没打给你 8次
I haven't called you eight times.

682
00:40:43,918 --> 00:40:45,928
没错  是11次
You're right. It was eleven.

683
00:40:45,928 --> 00:40:47,428
我还没算上那3次的无声来电
I'm not counting three hang-ups.

684
00:40:49,428 --> 00:40:50,928
还有那个卡片
And that card.

685
00:40:50,928 --> 00:40:53,428
「最高尚的友情像是爱情...」
"Friendship is the highest form of love"...

686
00:40:53,428 --> 00:40:55,938
好啦  我知道了
All right, I get the point.

687
00:40:56,438 --> 00:40:57,938
我是说  你是和很多人都上过床
I mean, when you've slept with as many guys as you have,

688
00:40:58,438 --> 00:40:59,958
所以这次对你来说也只算...
I'm sure that's all that was...

689
00:40:59,968 --> 00:41:00,438
另一次泄慾
another fuck.

690
00:41:00,438 --> 00:41:04,448
我从没说过这只是泄慾
Ah... I never said it was just another fuck.

691
00:41:04,448 --> 00:41:06,448
再说我也没和那麽多人上床
Besides I'm not slept with that many guys.

692
00:41:06,448 --> 00:41:07,518
别在这里讨论这问题  可以吗?
Can we not talk about it here?

693
00:41:07,518 --> 00:41:07,948
我还要工作
 I've got to work.

694
00:41:08,448 --> 00:41:08,948
小芙
Daph...

695
00:41:11,448 --> 00:41:12,948
我只是为了帮你
I was doing you a favour.

696
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:17,458
我们那次是只有性  没有爱的
That's all it was. That's all it was meant to be and...

697
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:19,438
现在你整个人奇怪到不行
Now you've totally gotten weird,

698
00:41:19,438 --> 00:41:20,458
我们说好不要这样的
which we agreed would not happen.

699
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:22,958
奇怪的人不是我
I'm not the one who got weird.

700
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:24,858
自从你认识布莱恩之後
Ever since you met Brian,

701
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:25,968
你整个人都变了
you've be- come this totally different person.

702
00:41:25,968 --> 00:41:28,468
你跟他去混酒吧  混夜店
You go out with him all the time to bars and clubs.

703
00:41:28,968 --> 00:41:29,968
这根本不是我认识的那个你
It's like I don't even know you.

704
00:41:32,968 --> 00:41:34,978
你变成一个全年无休的同志
You've just become this full- time homosexual.

705
00:42:26,528 --> 00:42:27,528
你怎麽找到我的?
How'd you find me?

706
00:42:29,528 --> 00:42:32,528
我不是说过吗?
Didn't I tell you?

707
00:42:32,528 --> 00:42:35,038
除了当会计之外  我还兼职侦探呢
Besides being an accountant, I'm also a part-time sleuth.

708
00:42:37,038 --> 00:42:39,538
-你好幽默      -是啊
-You're funny. -Yeah.

709
00:42:41,038 --> 00:42:42,538
绝对恐怖乐团(庞克乐团)都嫉妒我的幽默
Sheer Terror piques my wit.

710
00:42:48,548 --> 00:42:50,048
你的手好冷
Your hands are cold.

711
00:42:58,058 --> 00:42:59,058
我想要你回来住
I want you to come back.

712
00:43:02,058 --> 00:43:03,058
不行
I can't.

713
00:43:03,558 --> 00:43:04,058
别和我争
Don't argue.

714
00:43:04,568 --> 00:43:06,068
我会把所有事都搞砸的
I'll screw everything up.

715
00:43:06,068 --> 00:43:07,568
你不会的
You won't.

716
00:43:07,568 --> 00:43:08,568
我会帮你的
I'll make sure of it.

717
00:43:11,068 --> 00:43:12,068
我会照顾你
I'll take care of you.

718
00:43:14,068 --> 00:43:15,578
你还是走吧
I want you to go now.

719
00:43:17,078 --> 00:43:18,078
求求你
Please.

720
00:43:19,578 --> 00:43:21,078
让你睡在这个
And leave you sleeping on this mattress

721
00:43:21,078 --> 00:43:22,578
有人吐过的破床垫?
That some asshole threw up on?

722
00:43:25,088 --> 00:43:26,588
吐这上面的人是我
I'm the one who threw up on it.

723
00:43:38,098 --> 00:43:39,098
我没刷牙
My breath stinks.

724
00:43:45,108 --> 00:43:46,608
我不在乎
I don't care.

725
00:44:08,128 --> 00:44:10,628
那个  歌剧
That... opera...

726
00:44:12,128 --> 00:44:14,128
「茶花女」
"la traviata".

727
00:44:16,138 --> 00:44:17,638
你还没跟我讲结局
You never told me how it ends.

728
00:44:20,638 --> 00:44:22,638
那个谁和那荡妇结婚了吗?
Does what's- his-name marry the slut?

729
00:44:26,148 --> 00:44:28,148
当然
Of course.

730
00:44:29,648 --> 00:44:31,648
违背他混账父亲的意愿
Despite the wishes of his cruel father.

731
00:44:34,148 --> 00:44:35,158
然後...
And...

732
00:44:37,158 --> 00:44:38,658
他们以歌唱为生  唱了很多
They live to sing many...

733
00:44:40,658 --> 00:44:42,158
完美的合唱
Glorious duets.

734
00:45:04,178 --> 00:45:06,688
你  你干什麽?
What are... what are you doing?

735
00:45:12,688 --> 00:45:14,188
上车啦  冷死了

736
00:45:20,198 --> 00:45:22,198
耐心  年轻人  耐心点
Patience, young fella, patience.

737
00:45:23,698 --> 00:45:24,708
又要干嘛?
Now what?

738
00:46:03,238 --> 00:46:04,748
永别了  杰克
So long, Jack.

739
00:46:10,748 --> 00:46:11,748
你这个混蛋
You son of a bitch.
