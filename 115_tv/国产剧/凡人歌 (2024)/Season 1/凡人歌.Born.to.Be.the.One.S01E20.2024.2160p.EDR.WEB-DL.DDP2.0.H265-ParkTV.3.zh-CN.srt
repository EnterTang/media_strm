像对镜头做爱一样　对  就是这样
Make love to that lens, make love to it, go on.

6
00:00:49,225 --> 00:00:51,015
使劲干它  很好
Fuck it, that's it.

7
00:00:51,495 --> 00:00:52,675
完美  简直完美
Beautiful. Beautiful.

《就在今晚 》

12
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:08,085
你能想像又过一年了吗
Can you believe it's been a whole year already?

13
00:01:08,085 --> 00:01:09,215
从何时算起
Since what?

14
00:01:09,455 --> 00:01:11,655
巴比伦之王大赛吧
Mmm. King of Babylon contest.

15
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,365
它每回都让人看起来很盛大
It always seems like such a big deal at the time,

16
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:15,725
等过一星期  都没人记得赢家是谁
and then like a week later, you can't even remember who won.

17
00:01:15,765 --> 00:01:17,165
安琪儿·埃斯科巴
Angel Escobar.

18
00:01:17,195 --> 00:01:19,535

and a birthmark in the shape of Placido Domingo

21
00:01:24,515 --> 00:01:26,035
形状的胎记
in his inner right thigh.

22
00:01:26,055 --> 00:01:28,085
你可看得真专注
Wow, you were paying attention.

23
00:01:28,195 --> 00:01:29,555
我该吃醋吗
Should I be jealous?

24
00:01:30,025 --> 00:01:30,835
不必
No.

25
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:38,705
我吃不下甜点了
Think I'll skip dessert.

26
00:01:38,705 --> 00:01:40,615
谁关心一堆类固醇过高的肌肉男
Ah, who cares about a bunch of steroid gym bunnies

27
00:01:40,615 --> 00:01:41,855
穿着三角内裤在那翩翩起舞
dancing around in their jocks anyway?

28
00:01:41,855 --> 00:01:43,935
考虑到去年你上了所有参赛者
Considering you've fucked off last year's contestants,

29
00:01:43,935 --> 00:01:44,975
最关心的就是你吧
you?

30
00:01:47,455 --> 00:01:48,755
天哪  谁会那麽做
God, who would do that?

31
00:01:48,815 --> 00:01:50,115
谁不想和布莱恩上床啊
Who wouldn't fuck Brian?

32
00:01:50,115 --> 00:01:50,995
不是这个
No.

33
00:01:51,315 --> 00:01:53,035
我是说在那麽多人面前跳脱衣舞
I mean strip in front of all those people.

34
00:01:53,035 --> 00:01:55,095
为了1000美金和巴哈马之旅
For 1,000 bucks and a trip to the Bahamas?

35
00:01:55,095 --> 00:01:56,055
很多人会的
A lot of guys.

36
00:01:56,055 --> 00:01:57,485
尤其当你嗑过药
Especially when you're on drugs,

37
00:01:57,495 --> 00:01:58,995
拜托  你什麽都做得出来
please, you'll do anything.

38
00:02:02,735 --> 00:02:04,895
呃…抱歉
Oops, sorry.

39
00:02:05,505 --> 00:02:07,155
布雷克承认他有毒瘾
Blake acknowledges his addiction,

40
00:02:07,155 --> 00:02:08,415
而且正在戒掉它
and he's working on it.

41
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:11,925
我在参加同志中心的戒瘾会
I've been going to meetings at the gay and lesbian centre.

42
00:02:12,345 --> 00:02:14,645
哎呀  我们可不都有活儿在忙？
My, my, aren't we a busy little bee?

43
00:02:15,555 --> 00:02:18,855
那麽  明天10点巴比伦门口见
So, um, we'll all meet in front of Babylon? 10:00 o'clock?

44
00:02:19,085 --> 00:02:21,095
我不确定  我想大卫不会去的
I don't know. I don't think David's going to want to go

45
00:02:21,095 --> 00:02:22,435
因为有点晚
'cause it's kind of late.

46
00:02:22,565 --> 00:02:25,045
过了他要浸泡假牙的时间吗？
Does he already have his teeth in a glass by then?

47
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:26,925
我告诉你  他可每天早上6点就起床
I'll have you know he gets up at 6:00 o'clock every morning

48
00:02:26,925 --> 00:02:29,165
然後晨跑五公里  而你还在睡大觉
and runs five miles, while you're still in bed.

49
00:02:29,165 --> 00:02:31,925
床上是我锻炼心肺功能的地方
I feel that's where I get my best cardio workout.

50
00:02:32,595 --> 00:02:34,575
如果我希望他去  他会去的
I'm sure he would go if I wanted him to.

51
00:02:34,575 --> 00:02:35,155
啊哈
Uh-huh.

52
00:02:35,545 --> 00:02:37,285
-是真的  -行啊
- It's true. - All right.

53
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:38,465
那就把他带来
Then make sure he's there.

54
00:02:38,465 --> 00:02:39,485
没问题  我会
All right, I will.

55
00:02:39,485 --> 00:02:40,415
行了吧
Okay. Okay.

56
00:02:40,415 --> 00:02:41,235
-好极了  -最好是
- Great.    -Fine.

57
00:02:41,235 --> 00:02:42,575
那麽  你们也来吗
So, you coming?

58
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:47,045
巴比伦不是完全禁毒的场所
Well, Babylon isn't exactly a drug-free environment.

59
00:02:47,055 --> 00:02:48,355
布雷克是大孩子
You know, Blake's a big boy.

60
00:02:48,355 --> 00:02:49,985
为何不让他自己决定
Why don't you let him decide?

61
00:02:51,385 --> 00:02:52,695
我没问题的
I'm fine.

62
00:02:54,095 --> 00:02:55,205
真的
Really.

63
00:02:56,275 --> 00:02:56,855
算上我们
We're in.

64
00:02:56,855 --> 00:02:58,225
万岁
Hooray!

65
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,095
不过  这开始像是「夫夫之夜」了
Only it's starting to feel perilously like a couples night,

66
00:03:02,095 --> 00:03:03,965
看来我是唯一单身的
Seeing as I'm the only single boy left.

67
00:03:03,965 --> 00:03:06,195
不好意思  那我是什麽
'scuse me, what the fuck do you think I am?

68
00:03:06,195 --> 00:03:07,465
我们要去巴比伦是吗
Are we going to Babylon?

69
00:03:10,045 --> 00:03:10,965
有什麽不对吗
What?

70
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,585
这些牛仔裤的洞太大而且太紧了
Those jeans are all torn and too tight.

71
00:03:17,755 --> 00:03:18,645
啥
What?

72
00:03:22,665 --> 00:03:25,285
我说这裤子又破又紧
I said those jeans are all worn and too tight.

73
00:03:26,975 --> 00:03:28,675
之前怎麽没见你穿过
How come I haven't seen you in them before?

74
00:03:28,685 --> 00:03:31,145
我只在没乾净衣服可穿时才穿
I only wear them when I don't have clean clothes.

75
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:34,435
以後再也不许你洗衣服了
Well, you must stop doing laundry immediately.

76
00:03:37,245 --> 00:03:38,575
想出去玩吗
Do you feel like going out?

77
00:03:38,595 --> 00:03:40,825
今晚有巴比伦之王比赛
Tonight's the king of Babylon contest.

78
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:42,745
迈克  我都一把年纪了  不适合那个
Oh, Michael, I'm too old for that shit.

79
00:03:42,745 --> 00:03:43,755
不  你没那麽老
No, you're not.

80
00:03:43,755 --> 00:03:44,745
我确实老了
Yes, I am.

81
00:03:44,745 --> 00:03:46,645
听着  如果那些家伙看见
Huh. Look, if the guys saw

82
00:03:46,645 --> 00:03:48,965
你穿上这条裤子会如此性感
how incredibly sexy you look in those jeans,

83
00:03:48,965 --> 00:03:50,865
他们就不会
they'd prob- ably stop... Um...

84
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,735
-什麽　  -没什麽  别在意
-What?　-Nothing. Never mind.

85
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:55,205
-我什麽都不该说的　　　　-不　不
- I shouldn't have said anything. - No, no, no.

86
00:03:55,815 --> 00:03:57,225
把话说完
Finish what you were going to say.

87
00:03:58,385 --> 00:04:00,785
我打赌他们就不会再开成人尿布
I bet they'd stop making jokes about adult diapers,

88
00:04:00,785 --> 00:04:02,355
假牙黏合剂
and denture cream and...

89
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,785
还有阴茎增大术的玩笑了
penile implants.

90
00:04:05,755 --> 00:04:07,125
阴茎增大术？
Penile implants?

91
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,975
是你自己说的
Well, hey, you said it yourself,

92
00:04:08,975 --> 00:04:10,845
你都一把年纪了  不适合那个
You're too old for this shit.

93
00:04:22,995 --> 00:04:24,565
我就知道他们不会来
I knew they wouldn't come.

94
00:04:24,885 --> 00:04:27,695
也许那老头需要迈克帮他按摩前列腺
Michael probably had to give the old man a prostate massage.

95
00:04:27,695 --> 00:04:29,635
还有更糟的方式渡过周六晚上
There are worse ways to spend a Saturday night.

96
00:04:29,695 --> 00:04:30,725
伙计们
Hey, boys.

97
00:04:31,545 --> 00:04:32,715
抱歉我们迟到了
Sorry we're late, uh...

98
00:04:32,715 --> 00:04:35,375
我得等大卫做完1000个仰卧起坐
Had to wait for David to finish his 1,000 sit-ups.

99
00:04:39,265 --> 00:04:41,865
大卫  你看上去  棒极了
David, you... you look... great.

100
00:04:42,255 --> 00:04:44,695
我是说  见到你真好
I mean, it's great to... see you.

101
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:49,795
好啦  够了没  进去吧
Okay, enough of this. Let's go inside,

102
00:04:49,825 --> 00:04:50,935
里面有更多惹火的牛仔裤可看
where they have some more jeans.

103
00:04:50,935 --> 00:04:51,895
你们先请
Yeah, why don't you go before us?

104
00:05:11,815 --> 00:05:13,205
大家喝一杯吧
Hey, let's have a drink.

105
00:05:13,495 --> 00:05:14,405
我请客
On me.

106
00:05:14,895 --> 00:05:16,895
不了  我先去舞池转转
No, I think I'm going to go check out the dance floor.

107
00:05:17,445 --> 00:05:18,665
我也是
Yeah, me too.

108
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:19,935
我也去
Same here.

109
00:05:20,365 --> 00:05:21,505
还是谢谢啦
Thanks anyway.

110
00:05:25,435 --> 00:05:28,685
我猜我不怎麽受欢迎
Guess I won't be winning any popularity contest tonight.

111
00:05:32,105 --> 00:05:33,785
有问题的不是你
It's not your problem.

112
00:05:35,385 --> 00:05:37,365
是他们  来吧
It's theirs. Come on.

113
00:05:39,535 --> 00:05:41,675
-老兄                 -最近怎麽样
- He-ey, dude.     -How's it going?

114
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,035
最近都没看见你
Haven't seen you around.

115
00:05:43,215 --> 00:05:44,385
我离开了一阵子
I've been away.

116
00:05:46,205 --> 00:05:47,385
欢迎回来
Welcome back.

117
00:05:47,635 --> 00:05:48,845
要帮忙吗
Need a favour?

118
00:05:49,465 --> 00:05:50,765
不  谢了
No thanks.

119
00:05:53,495 --> 00:05:54,515
他是谁
Who's that?

120
00:05:54,575 --> 00:05:55,745
谁都不是
Nobody.

121
00:05:58,695 --> 00:05:59,945
我的药头
My dealer.

122
00:06:03,195 --> 00:06:05,585
-以前的药头     -就知道我们不该来这儿
-Ex-dealer. 　　-I knew we shouldn't have come here.

123
00:06:05,585 --> 00:06:06,805
没关系的
It's okay.

124
00:06:07,725 --> 00:06:09,035
我没事
I'm okay.

125
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:17,655
听着  你得相信我  好吗
Look, you have to trust me, okay?

126
00:06:20,895 --> 00:06:22,045
我相信
I do.

127
00:06:29,085 --> 00:06:30,255
跳舞去
Let's dance.

128
00:06:39,335 --> 00:06:41,835
先生们和先生们
Gentlemen and gentlemen,

有请今晚的主持人

集高贵粗鲁於一身的  希巴
her royal rudeness, Sheba,

131
00:06:48,165 --> 00:06:50,455
巴比伦皇后
Queen of Babylon.

132
00:07:10,425 --> 00:07:12,985
得保证我高贵的双峰完好无缺
Gotta make sure the royal tits are intact.

133
00:07:13,945 --> 00:07:15,495
行了  男孩们  闪吧
All right, boys. Go away.

134
00:07:15,495 --> 00:07:17,175
自己一边玩儿去  回头见
Go play with yourselves. Ch-ciao.

135
00:07:19,665 --> 00:07:23,745
欢迎来到第73届奥斯卡…

136
00:07:24,115 --> 00:07:25,925
噢  搞错了
Oops, wrong show.

137
00:07:25,925 --> 00:07:29,285
欢迎来到巴比伦之王大赛
Welcome to the king of Babylon contest...

138
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,425
竞争是很激烈的    (Stiff亦指很硬)
Where the competition is stiff,

139
00:07:32,425 --> 00:07:34,685
参赛者也是
and so are the contestants.

189
00:11:39,255 --> 00:11:41,805
这个比赛的问题在於它暴露了一条
The problem with this contest is that it exposes the single,

同志文化中最致命的缺点

196
00:11:56,065 --> 00:11:58,025
在我们摆脱这种幼稚
And until we break free of our stunted...

197
00:11:58,025 --> 00:11:59,935
和肤浅的价值观之前
adolescence and our superficial values,

198
00:11:59,945 --> 00:12:01,945
我们永远都成不了真正的男人
we'll always be boys, never men.

199
00:12:01,945 --> 00:12:03,315
老天  就这样吗？
God, is that all?

200
00:12:03,665 --> 00:12:06,855
我倒觉得大卫的话意味深长啊
I happen to find what David is saying to be profoundly insightful.

201
00:12:06,865 --> 00:12:10,085
我觉得这些话真是满口胡扯

这些自以为是的观点

208
00:12:38,885 --> 00:12:40,345
那你干嘛不去报名
So why don't you sign up?

209
00:12:40,995 --> 00:12:43,635
因为我不用穿着内裤跳舞吸引炮友上门
'Cause I don't need to dance around in my underwear to get laid.

210
00:12:43,635 --> 00:12:46,875
或者…  你害怕和人竞争
Or maybe... you can't handle the competition.

211
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:01,195
我的老天  他要去报名了

213
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:04,695
不可能
No way.

214
00:13:04,855 --> 00:13:05,955

He can perform "auto fellatio".

218
00:13:17,085 --> 00:13:18,455
这啥姿势啊
What the fuck's that?

219
00:13:18,455 --> 00:13:20,405
是说在你车里口交吗
If that's giving a blow job in your car,

220
00:13:20,405 --> 00:13:22,275
那我也算是大师级了

221
00:13:53,545 --> 00:13:55,315
该死  我身上这花开始凋谢了

这男的
This guy.

227
00:14:08,105 --> 00:14:09,795
不都因为男人吗？
Hmm. Ain't it always?

228
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:13,305
所以这个男的怎麽了？
So, what did this guy do?

229

他根本不把我当回事儿

我知道
I know.

233
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,255
那也是我生气的原因之一
That's the part I find so irritating.

234
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,295
也许他也应该发现这点
Maybe he needs to know it.

235
00:14:28,315 --> 00:14:30,405
也许所有人都该发现这点
Maybe everybody needs to know it.

我在商场来着  当时我去厕所
I was at the mall, I went to pee.

261
00:15:43,185 --> 00:15:44,275
就好像
I-it's as though...

262
00:15:44,285 --> 00:15:46,435
好像我们已经认识很久了
we've known each other all our lives.

263
00:15:46,435 --> 00:15:47,565
没错
Exactly.

264
00:15:47,825 --> 00:15:50,445

269
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:03,775

Look, I... I know this is ridiculously forward of me...

270
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,915
我是说  我们几乎都不认识对方
I mean... I mean, we... Hardly know each other.

271
00:16:07,565 --> 00:16:09,965
可你介意吗  就是...
But would you mind... that is,

272
00:16:10,155 --> 00:16:12,865
这要求比较过分  如果我

所有的惊喜都一起降临了
all rolled up into one.

278
00:16:56,195 --> 00:16:57,705
没有美国独立纪念日吗
Not the fourth of july?

279
00:16:59,005 --> 00:17:02,875
这个嘛   要留给你享受了
Well... I'm saving that for you.

280
00:17:21,235 --> 00:17:22,325
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

281
00:17:22,485 --> 00:17:23,595
你去哪儿
Where you going?

282
00:17:23,945 --> 00:17:25,065
厕所
Bathroom.

283
00:17:27,355 --> 00:17:29,425
你觉得让他自己去好吗
Do you think it's a good idea to let him go alone?

284
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:31,545
你想让我帮他扶着吗？
Would you like me to hold it for him?

285
00:17:31,685 --> 00:17:34,545
不是  我是说上次发生的那件事之後
No, I mean, after what happened last time.

286
00:17:35,835 --> 00:17:37,125
这叫信任
It's called trust.

287
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,755
是啊　你可以确信他最後还是会被送去急诊
Yeah, you can trust he'll end up in the emergency room.

288
00:17:40,285 --> 00:17:41,475
他不会的
Maybe he won't.

289
00:17:42,135 --> 00:17:44,845
也许他会让你们都失望  然後好好的
Maybe he'll disappoint all of you and actually be all right.

290
00:17:46,615 --> 00:17:48,115
当你还是个小屁孩的时候
When you were a boy,

291
00:17:48,555 --> 00:17:50,705
你会去救那些翅膀受伤的小鸟吗
did you save the birds with the broken wings?

292
00:17:52,835 --> 00:17:54,305
那你怎麽做  把他们撕碎吗
What did you do, tear them off?

293
00:17:55,065 --> 00:17:56,175
同学们
Everybody...

294
00:17:56,965 --> 00:17:59,985
我要给你们介绍一个非常特别的人
I want you to meet a very special someone.

295
00:18:04,515 --> 00:18:06,145
-我叫布伦特    -布伦特
-I'm Brent.　　 -Brent!

296
00:18:06,145 --> 00:18:07,405
-嗨  布伦特  -嗨
- Hi, Brent. - Hi.

297
00:18:07,405 --> 00:18:09,585
你好啊  布伦特  欢迎
Hi... Brent. Hello, welcome.

298
00:18:09,785 --> 00:18:13,325
艾美特觉得很重要的人  对我们来说也很重要
Anyone who's special to Emmett is special to us.

299
00:18:13,335 --> 00:18:14,225
谁
Who?

300
00:18:14,475 --> 00:18:15,515
艾美特
Emmett.

301
00:18:16,135 --> 00:18:17,485
就是我  亲爱的
That's me, darling.

302
00:18:18,935 --> 00:18:20,615
你俩认识多久了
How long have you two known each other?

303
00:18:20,665 --> 00:18:24,025
这辈子的话  只是一小会
Well, I-in this life, only a... brief while.

304
00:18:24,025 --> 00:18:26,125
不过  我相信前几辈子
But, uh... but I-I believe that in past lives,

305
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,385
我们就已经相遇很多次了
we've known each other many times before.

306
00:18:28,505 --> 00:18:29,615
是不是
Uh, don't you?

307
00:18:29,765 --> 00:18:31,005
这是我们有这麽多共同点的
Oh, it's the only explanation

308
00:18:31,005 --> 00:18:33,335
唯一解释了
for how we could have so much in common.

309
00:18:33,415 --> 00:18:34,915
简直难以置信
You can't believe it.

310
00:18:35,245 --> 00:18:37,345
我们都喜欢布莱德·彼特
We both love Brad Pitt.

311
00:18:38,175 --> 00:18:39,485
倩碧男性护肤品
Clinique for men.

312
00:18:39,695 --> 00:18:42,175
特别是打折的时候
Especially when they're having a sale.

313
00:18:42,275 --> 00:18:44,725
葱味薯片
Uh, green onion-flavoured potato chips.

314
00:18:44,725 --> 00:18:46,195
还有我们最爱的歌
And our favourite song...

315
00:18:48,485 --> 00:18:50,035
是「远处某地」
is "Somewhere out there".

316
00:18:50,695 --> 00:18:52,795
这才叫不可思议
Now that's uncanny.

317
00:18:53,895 --> 00:18:55,555
过来和我们喝几杯吧
Well, come and have a drink with us.

318
00:19:03,865 --> 00:19:05,065
喂  怎麽了
Hey, what's up?

319
00:19:08,465 --> 00:19:09,475
到底怎麽了
What's the problem?

320
00:19:12,005 --> 00:19:13,985
艾美特才认识那个人15分钟
Emmett knows some guy for all of 15 minutes

321
00:19:13,985 --> 00:19:15,625
他几乎就变成咱们的好兄弟了
and he's practically a frat brother.

322
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,245
而你几乎都不乐意搭理布雷克
Blake you can barely speak to.

323
00:19:17,245 --> 00:19:19,125
也许是因为
Well, maybe that's because...

324
00:19:19,985 --> 00:19:22,075
我不知道和他聊什麽
I don't know what to say.

325
00:19:22,575 --> 00:19:24,175
「所以，你差点害死我的好朋友」
"So, you nearly killed my friend."

326
00:19:24,175 --> 00:19:26,765
「我听说你在厕所昏倒了」
"Hey, I hear you passed out on the bathroom floor.

327
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,055
「想来点好东西吗」
You want to be buds?"

328
00:19:29,845 --> 00:19:31,555
我一直觉得要是有人能给他个机会
You know, I figured if anyone could've given him a chance,

329
00:19:31,555 --> 00:19:33,225
那个人就是你   迈克
it would've been you, Michael.

330
00:19:39,385 --> 00:19:41,515
天哪  等一下
Hold on, Jesus!

331
00:19:41,855 --> 00:19:43,015
来了
I'm coming.

332
00:19:45,335 --> 00:19:45,875
怎麽了
What's the matter?

333
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,705
我一直给你们打电话打不通
I've been calling, But there's no answer.

334
00:19:47,705 --> 00:19:48,965
我们晚上电话都关机
Oh, we turn the phone off at night.

335
00:19:48,975 --> 00:19:49,985
怕把盖斯吵醒
It wakes Gus up.

336
00:19:49,995 --> 00:19:52,245
真不好意思这麽晚过来打扰
I'm... I-I'm sorry to be coming by so late.

337
00:19:52,255 --> 00:19:53,695
维克入狱了
Vic's in jail.

338
00:19:54,015 --> 00:19:55,025
什麽
What?

339
00:19:55,025 --> 00:19:57,775
他说他在商场厕所里
He said he was at the mall, he went to the men's room,

340
00:19:57,825 --> 00:20:00,715
因为暴露罪被逮捕了  (妨碍风化)
and the next thing is they arrested him for indecent exposure.

341
00:20:00,725 --> 00:20:02,435
暴露罪
Indecent exposure?

342
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:04,695
是  他发誓他什麽都没做
Yeah, he swears he didn't do anything.

343
00:20:07,425 --> 00:20:08,485
他需要一个律师
But he needs a lawyer,

344
00:20:08,485 --> 00:20:09,415
可是我不知道去哪
and I didn't know where to...

345
00:20:09,415 --> 00:20:10,575
没事没事  我这就去换衣服
No, no, it's okay. I'm going to go get dressed.

346
00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:12,485
要是他什麽都没做  干吗要抓他？
Well, if he didn't do anything, why did they arrest him?

347
00:20:12,485 --> 00:20:14,115
他们就是看不惯同性恋
Oh, I-it's... harassment of gay people.

348
00:20:14,115 --> 00:20:16,285
警察喜欢「钓鱼钓到甲鱼」
Cops just like playing "capture the fag".

349
00:20:16,635 --> 00:20:17,405
你刚才什麽意思
What are you saying?

350
00:20:17,405 --> 00:20:18,845
你是觉得维克真的做了什麽？
You think Vic did something?

351
00:20:19,115 --> 00:20:19,985
我就是问一下
I was just asking...

352
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,235
告诉你  我了解我亲弟弟
Yeah well, I'm telling you, I know my own brother.

353
00:20:22,675 --> 00:20:23,805
那罪名是瞎扯
And it's crap.

354
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,185
听我说  会没事的
Listen, it's going to be okay.

355
00:20:25,195 --> 00:20:27,565
我现在去换衣服  咱们现在就走
I'm going to go get dressed, but we better get a move on.

356
00:20:27,575 --> 00:20:28,875
我马上过来
I'll be right back.

357
00:20:44,815 --> 00:20:46,755
你叫我一小时之後来找你
You said to check back with you in an hour.

358
00:20:47,905 --> 00:20:49,695
还剩八分钟
I still have eight minutes left.

359
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,995
他屁股上有痘痘
He has zits on his ass,

360
00:20:58,415 --> 00:20:59,925
小弟弟尺寸很悲剧
a tragic endowment,

361
00:20:59,995 --> 00:21:02,375
而且刚从经历一场严重的淋病
and is just getting over a nasty case of gonorrhea.

362
00:21:08,045 --> 00:21:09,875
如果我是你  我不会等太久的
Well, if I were you, I wouldn't wait too long.

363
00:21:10,265 --> 00:21:12,335
到时候我可能已经也有其他计划了
By then I may have other plans.

364
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,065
你到底怎麽了
So, what's with you anyway?

365
00:21:23,145 --> 00:21:24,175
没怎麽
Nothing.

366
00:21:24,635 --> 00:21:26,885
你朋友是  什麽人啊
Who's your, uh... friend?

367
00:21:30,295 --> 00:21:31,305
谁也不是
Nobody.

368
00:21:31,305 --> 00:21:32,855
我看你俩挺亲密的啊
You look pretty tight to me.

369
00:21:33,745 --> 00:21:35,505
你干吗不介绍我们认识
So how come you didn't introduce us?

370
00:21:37,035 --> 00:21:38,415
他不会喜欢你的
He wouldn't like you.

371
00:21:38,935 --> 00:21:40,525
也说不定
Maybe he would if I, uh...

372
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,475
要是我给他点猛料
Offered him a favour.

373
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:45,435
他不会对你的猛料感兴趣的
Yeah well, he's not interested in any of your "favours".

374
00:21:50,615 --> 00:21:51,835
好东西
Great stuff.

375
00:21:53,575 --> 00:21:55,085
好价钱
Great price.

376
00:22:00,335 --> 00:22:01,785
我说了  我也没兴趣
And I told you, neither am I.

377
00:22:12,545 --> 00:22:13,545
你在干吗
What are you doing?

378
00:22:14,795 --> 00:22:16,245
我不过是
I'll be just a little looks like

379
00:22:16,385 --> 00:22:18,015
在男厕外面转一转
loitering outside the men's room.

380
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:20,055
你来监视我的吗
Did you come to check up on me?

381
00:22:20,815 --> 00:22:22,045
当然不是
'course not.

382
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:24,395
我刚遇见了这里最可爱的人
I just seem to meet the cutest guys here.

383
00:22:24,395 --> 00:22:26,255
我跟你说了  我很好
'cause I told you, I'm fine.

384
00:22:33,055 --> 00:22:34,025
我知道
I know.

385
00:22:40,195 --> 00:22:41,735
来吧
Come on, let's, uh...

386
00:22:42,345 --> 00:22:43,465
咱们去找其他人去
go find the others.

387
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:45,405
别去
Let's not.

388
00:22:46,895 --> 00:22:48,455
我只想和你在一起
I'd rather just be with you.

389
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,305
绅士们都喜欢金发美女
Gentlemen prefer blondes,

390
00:22:51,305 --> 00:22:54,065
而这个金发美女喜欢皮革猛男
and this blonde prefers gentlemen in leather.

391
00:22:54,255 --> 00:22:56,855
让我们掌声欢迎德维恩
A big hand for Dwayne.

392
00:23:16,655 --> 00:23:19,975
我一直梦想着住在一间小木屋里
I've always dreamt about living in a little cottage...

393
00:23:20,145 --> 00:23:21,775
带後花园的那种
With a garden out back?

394
00:23:21,855 --> 00:23:25,475
我可以在花园种满薰衣草和水仙花
W-where I can grow lavender and daffodils, and...

395
00:23:27,345 --> 00:23:28,595
像我姑姑贝尔一样
wear a big sun bonnet,

396
00:23:28,595 --> 00:23:31,435
戴着那种系头带的洋帽
like my aunt Belle, that ties under the chin.

397
00:23:31,735 --> 00:23:33,735
我们可以用自己种的蔬菜
And we'll cook gourmet meals...

398
00:23:33,735 --> 00:23:36,665
烹饪人间美味
seasoned with our very own herbs.

399
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,815
在飘雪的晚上　我可以在火炉前
And on snowy evenings, we'll curl up in front of the fire

400
00:23:39,815 --> 00:23:42,405
抱在一起取暖品茗
with big mugs of hot tea.

401
00:23:42,535 --> 00:23:44,025
夏天的时候
And... and in the summer,

402
00:23:44,225 --> 00:23:47,465
我们慵懒地走在
we'll take long, lazy walks down a...

403
00:23:47,655 --> 00:23:50,385
洒满夕阳余晖的乡间小路上
sun-dappled country lane.

404
00:23:54,715 --> 00:23:55,795
人间天堂
It's heaven.

405
00:23:56,655 --> 00:23:57,865
极乐世界
Bliss.

406
00:24:02,335 --> 00:24:03,845
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

407
00:24:04,345 --> 00:24:05,775
别走开
Don't go away.

408
00:24:05,915 --> 00:24:08,935
我就在这  等你
I'll be waiting... right here.

409
00:24:28,695 --> 00:24:31,525
准备好和我耳鬓厮磨一整夜了吗
You had enough pulsating, grinding flesh for one evening?

410
00:24:31,525 --> 00:24:33,105
随时随地
I'm ready to go whenever you are.

411
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:34,735
不  你还不能走
No, you can't leave yet.

412
00:24:35,275 --> 00:24:36,465
你会错过我的重头戏的
You'll miss my big number.

413
00:24:36,465 --> 00:24:38,655
就跟你真的会上台一样
Oh, right, like you'd really go through with it.

414
00:24:38,655 --> 00:24:40,835
要是你现在走  就永远看不到了
Well, if you leave now, you'll never know.

415
00:24:40,865 --> 00:24:42,075
德维恩
Dwayne!

416
00:24:45,565 --> 00:24:47,855
要是德维恩成为了国王
If Dwayne becomes king,

417
00:24:48,245 --> 00:24:51,745
其他人可要以他为标准啊
he'll be the ruler by whom all others are measured.

418
00:24:51,795 --> 00:24:54,345
我可是亲自量过了他的尺寸
I ought to know, I measured him myself.

419
00:24:56,525 --> 00:25:00,445
我们下一位参赛者是个喜欢吃嫩草
Right. Our next contestant likes younger men.

420
00:25:00,525 --> 00:25:03,475
他的爱好是感觉高人一等
His favourite pastime is feeling superior.

421
00:25:03,505 --> 00:25:06,655
他的特长是控制他人
His special skill is manipulating people.

422
00:25:07,445 --> 00:25:08,565
就你了
Must be you.

423
00:25:08,695 --> 00:25:12,875
让我们热烈欢迎匹兹堡最猛的理疗师
Let's put our hands together for Pittsburgh's hunkiest chiropractor,

卡麦伦医生  寻找卡麦伦医生？
Dr. Cameron? Paging Dr. Cameron.

427
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:26,365
我以为你要自己上台呢
I thought you were signing up yourself.

428
00:25:26,815 --> 00:25:28,645
我干嘛要那麽做
Now why would I want to do that,

429
00:25:28,935 --> 00:25:30,335
有监於我发觉到人们对
when you know I find this obsession

430
00:25:30,335 --> 00:25:33,585
青春、腹肌、和性爱的迷恋有多可怕
with youth and abs and sex so appalling?

431
00:25:33,585 --> 00:25:35,615
你不必上去的
You don't have to go up there.

432
00:25:35,665 --> 00:25:37,175
别担心  本来我也没想上去
Don't worry, I have no intention of it.

433
00:25:37,175 --> 00:25:38,965
感谢老天
Thank god.

434
00:25:39,185 --> 00:25:40,595
你不会想在你这把年纪
You wouldn't want to make a fool of yourself

435
00:25:40,595 --> 00:25:43,205
穿着内裤扭来扭去的
dancing around in your underwear at your age.

436
00:25:43,495 --> 00:25:46,435
别担心  医生  开个玩笑而已
Don't worry about it, doc, it was just a joke.

437
00:25:47,355 --> 00:25:48,945
你觉得我做不来
Well, you think I can't do it?

438
00:25:49,525 --> 00:25:50,265
在这把年纪
At my age?

439
00:25:50,265 --> 00:25:52,025
寻找卡麦伦医生
Paging Dr. Cameron!

440
00:25:53,775 --> 00:25:55,275
天哪
Mother of god!

441
00:25:56,895 --> 00:25:58,545
卡麦伦医生

442
00:26:08,455 --> 00:26:12,285
卡麦伦  卡麦伦

卡麦伦  卡麦伦
Dr. Cameron! dr. Cameron!

445
00:27:57,545 --> 00:27:58,685
不是吧
He isn't.

446
00:28:01,325 --> 00:28:02,485
是的
Yes, he is.

447
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,395
警官  不好意思  我们来看
Excuse me, sergeant? We're here to see...

448
00:28:29,395 --> 00:28:30,725
维克多·格拉西
Victor Grassi.

449
00:28:30,725 --> 00:28:31,945
格拉西
Grassi.

450
00:28:33,015 --> 00:28:34,475
女士  不好意思
Oh, uh, sorry, ladies.

451
00:28:34,475 --> 00:28:36,655
你们得等一下  他还在接受审讯
You have to come back later. He's still being processed.

452
00:28:36,655 --> 00:28:37,815
我是他姐姐
But I'm his sister.

453
00:28:37,815 --> 00:28:39,085
我是他的律师
And I'm Mr. Grassi's attorney.

454
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:41,395
你能告诉我他需要多少保释金吗
Could you just tell me how much his bail is set at?

455
00:28:42,065 --> 00:28:43,635
五千块
5,000.

456
00:28:44,085 --> 00:28:45,595
-什麽？　   -五千美元
-What? 　　-$5,000?

457
00:28:45,595 --> 00:28:47,565
对一个初犯来讲是不是太高了
Isn't that high for a first offense?

458
00:28:47,565 --> 00:28:49,565
这里写着他有过前科
Says here he's got a previous arrest.

459
00:28:49,565 --> 00:28:52,465
-因为什麽  -携带违禁物品
- For what? - Possession of an illegal substance.

460
00:29:00,755 --> 00:29:03,945
他是被拉下水的  那是十年前了
He was pulled over, it was 10 years ago.

461
00:29:06,015 --> 00:29:08,385
杂物箱里有一卷大麻烟
There was a joint in the glove compartment.

462
00:29:09,005 --> 00:29:10,475
那不是他的
It wasn't even his.

463
00:29:10,485 --> 00:29:11,995
那他为什麽不反驳呢？
Then why didn't he say something?

464
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:14,705
因为即使在小时候
Because even when we were kids,

465
00:29:14,705 --> 00:29:16,105
他也从没告发过我
he never squealed on me.

466
00:29:20,795 --> 00:29:21,995
警官
Look, officer.

467
00:29:22,235 --> 00:29:23,735
我弟弟病的很严重
my brother's very sick.

468
00:29:24,085 --> 00:29:25,765
他得吃药
he's got to take his meds.

469
00:29:26,205 --> 00:29:27,065
他有什麽问题
What's wrong with him?

470
00:29:27,075 --> 00:29:28,725
他是HIV阳性
He's H.I.V positive.

471
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,005
哦  想也知道
Oh, figures.

472
00:29:30,005 --> 00:29:30,995
你说什麽？
Excuse me?

473
00:29:30,995 --> 00:29:32,905
要等这边的医生检查他之後
No drugs allowed in the holding cell

474
00:29:32,905 --> 00:29:34,975
这些药才能带进拘留室
until the precinct doctors examine him.

475
00:29:34,975 --> 00:29:36,915
但是这些是处方药
But these are prescription medications.

476
00:29:36,915 --> 00:29:38,235
没了它们他活不了
His life depends on it.

477
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:39,235
要是他真病的这麽厉害
Well, if he's so sick,

478
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:41,155
他干吗要在公厕里晃来晃去
what was he doing hanging out in a public men's room?

479
00:29:41,175 --> 00:29:42,665
撒尿啊
Taking a piss.

480
00:29:44,005 --> 00:29:44,735
老天
Jesus.

481
00:29:44,735 --> 00:29:45,625
走吧
Come on.

482
00:29:58,695 --> 00:30:00,005
你太可爱了
You're so cute.

483
00:30:00,005 --> 00:29:59,605
你的腹肌太帅了
You have great abs.

484
00:30:00,195 --> 00:30:02,285
坚固的背部支撑和
Uh, well, they're... they're essential for, uh,

485
00:30:02,285 --> 00:30:04,315
良好的姿势很重要

486
00:30:04,315 --> 00:30:05,905
-打给我 　  -还有我

随时奉陪
Anytime.

488
00:30:06,935 --> 00:30:08,775
保证不会让你失望
I'll make it so worth your while.

489
00:30:08,775 --> 00:30:11,265
有没有搞错？
Do you mind?

490
00:30:11,265 --> 00:30:12,775
他已经名草有主了
He's already taken.

491
00:30:14,715 --> 00:30:16,605
看你那得意劲儿
Well, I suppose you're pleased with yourself.

492
00:30:16,755 --> 00:30:18,135
满脸春风的样子
Wipe that grin off your face.

493
00:30:18,135 --> 00:30:19,805
把衬衫穿上！

499
00:31:12,215 --> 00:31:14,825
还有一个不懂珍惜他的老男人
and older men who take him for granted.

500
00:31:14,995 --> 00:31:16,695
有请…贾斯汀
Here's justin!

501
00:31:38,395 --> 00:31:40,675
我  的  天  啊

Wait.

504
00:33:48,525 --> 00:33:50,985
你去哪儿？  我都开始担心了
Where were you? I was starting to worry.

505
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:53,225
对不起  有点事耽误了
Sorry. I got hung up.

506
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:55,625
没事
That's okay.

507
00:33:56,385 --> 00:33:58,205
正好让我多想你一会
Gave me more time to miss you.

508

这样等你回来我就会更开心

I guess so.

511
00:34:10,355 --> 00:34:12,965
我记得你没用古龙水

516
00:34:21,605 --> 00:34:22,595
好吧
Okay.

00:34:23,665 --> 00:34:24,815
我们说到哪儿了

对了  说到我们可爱的小屋

不  等等
No, wait.

520
00:34:31,365 --> 00:34:32,695
我不能欺骗你
I can't lie to you.

521
00:34:33,135 --> 00:34:35,975
我们应该坦诚相待
We've meant too much to each other for that.

522
00:34:38,925 --> 00:34:40,335
我刚遇到了一个人
I've met someone new.

523
00:34:41,325 --> 00:34:42,455
刚遇到？
New?

524
00:34:43,365 --> 00:34:45,365
我们在一起才1小时45分钟
We've only been together an hour and 45 minutes.

525
00:34:45,365 --> 00:34:48,275
我也不想事情变成这样  我发誓
Look, I didn't mean for it to happen, I swear.

526

我从来没想过会伤害你
I never, never meant to hurt you.

你怎麽能这样对我
How could you do this to me?

531
00:35:15,845 --> 00:35:17,055
对我们
To us?

532
00:35:17,655 --> 00:35:19,875
-我们分享了那麽多　　　-别这样
- After all that we shared?　 - Please,

533
00:35:20,095 --> 00:35:22,435
别把事情搞得更加复杂
don't make this harder than it has to be.

534
00:35:22,515 --> 00:35:26,365
你说一生中从没和谁感觉这麽亲近过
You said that you never felt so close to anyone in your whole life.

535
00:35:26,495 --> 00:35:29,295
你说我们是天生的一对
That... that we... we were two halves of the same soul.

536
00:35:29,665 --> 00:35:31,015
世事多变
Things change.

537
00:35:32,355 --> 00:35:33,235
凡人也多变
People change.

538
00:35:33,235 --> 00:35:35,065
我还没变
I haven't changed.

539
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:38,225
我还爱你
I still love you.

540
00:35:40,965 --> 00:35:43,365
激情会随着时间消逝
In time, passion dies.

541
00:35:43,365 --> 00:35:46,215
你得接受它然後往前走
You have to accept it and move on.

542
00:35:46,365 --> 00:35:47,375
好
Fine.

545
00:35:57,675 --> 00:35:59,025
我会记得你的
I'll remember you...

546
00:36:00,765 --> 00:36:01,655
一直记得
always.

547
00:36:01,655 --> 00:36:03,895
多久  到明天吗
Yeah, how long is that? Till tomorrow?

548
00:36:08,215 --> 00:36:11,535
我给了你我一生中最好的时刻
I gave you the best minutes of my... life

549
00:36:28,805 --> 00:36:30,965
你值夜班  是吧  警官
So you got the night shift, huh, sergeant?

550
00:36:33,635 --> 00:36:35,375
我在餐厅也是上夜班
I did the same thing at the diner.

551
00:36:36,315 --> 00:36:37,705
午夜到早上8点
Midnight to 8:00.

552
00:36:38,505 --> 00:36:40,215
再加上8点到下午4点
In addition to 8:00 to 4:00.

553
00:36:41,245 --> 00:36:42,725
连续16个小时
16 hours straight

554
00:36:43,405 --> 00:36:45,465
就为了付我弟弟的医药费
To help pay for my brother's medical bills.

555
00:36:46,925 --> 00:36:48,385
当你家里有人身体不好的时候
But you do that you know, when...

556
00:36:48,535 --> 00:36:50,245
你不得不这样
someone in your family's sick.

557
00:36:54,065 --> 00:36:56,405
你家里有人需要照顾吗
Is there anybody in your family who needs attention?

558
00:36:58,495 --> 00:37:00,085
我妹妹是糖尿病患者
My sister's a diabetic.

559
00:37:01,785 --> 00:37:03,745
她10岁的时候得的
She got it when she was about 10.

560
00:37:03,745 --> 00:37:05,345
她现在还好吗？
Yeah, so how's she doing?

561
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:07,275
几年前她的腿截肢了
They cut her leg off a few years ago.

562
00:37:07,955 --> 00:37:09,935
现在她正慢慢失明
Now she's losing her sight.

563
00:37:10,975 --> 00:37:12,225
上帝保佑她
God bless her.

564
00:37:14,835 --> 00:37:16,355
那我想你应该是
So, I imagine you'd swim the English channel

565
00:37:16,355 --> 00:37:18,315
不辞辛苦地陪着她吧
to be there for her, huh?

566
00:37:19,105 --> 00:37:20,765
事实上  我们不常见面
Actually, we don't see much of each other.

567
00:37:20,765 --> 00:37:21,825
我们从没一起生活
We never got along.

568
00:37:21,955 --> 00:37:23,775
不介意的话  我在工作呢
Now do you mind? I'm trying to work here.

569
00:37:29,115 --> 00:37:30,405
就几片药而已
It's a few pills.

570
00:37:34,475 --> 00:37:36,145
就该死的几片药而已
It's a few fucking pills.

571
00:37:41,895 --> 00:37:42,955
没事
It's okay.

572
00:37:48,815 --> 00:37:51,525
我们到哪儿去搞5千块
How the hell are we gonna get $5,000?

573
00:38:01,315 --> 00:38:03,995
获胜者已经选出了
I believe we have a winner.

574
00:38:04,335 --> 00:38:06,315
各位  准备屈膝迎接
Everybody, down on your knees,

575
00:38:06,315 --> 00:38:08,465
我知道这是你们最爱的动作　(指跪下口交)
where I know you all want to be,

576
00:38:08,925 --> 00:38:11,375
新一代巴比伦之王
for the new king of Babylon...

577
00:38:11,945 --> 00:38:13,845
恭请我们的殿下
His royal highness...

578
00:38:14,365 --> 00:38:15,815
贾斯汀
Justin!

579
00:38:48,905 --> 00:38:51,305
不管那个不珍惜你的混蛋是谁
Whoever that asshole is who's been ignoring you,

580
00:38:51,305 --> 00:38:53,185
他都不会再把你不当一回事了
he won't be taking you for granted any more.

581
00:38:55,645 --> 00:38:57,775
谢谢你  谢谢
Thank you. Thanks.

582
00:39:22,225 --> 00:39:23,385
看到我表演了吗
Did you see me?

583
00:39:23,465 --> 00:39:24,615
是  我看到了
Yeah, I saw you.

584
00:39:25,045 --> 00:39:26,125
然後呢
Well?

585
00:39:26,345 --> 00:39:28,405
我认为这个比赛有黑幕
I think that contest was rigged.

586
00:39:28,495 --> 00:39:29,635
你认识他
You know him?

587
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:31,095
是的
Yeah.

588
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:32,785
他所有一切都是我教的
I taught him everything he knows.

589
00:39:32,905 --> 00:39:34,215
除了跳舞
Except how to dance.

590
00:39:38,315 --> 00:39:39,345
你叫什麽名字
What's your name?

591
00:39:39,675 --> 00:39:41,575
我本该问他的   不过我想他肯定不知道
I'd ask him, only I'm sure he doesn't know.

592
00:39:41,835 --> 00:39:42,975
肖恩
Shawn.

593
00:39:43,505 --> 00:39:44,705
你真性感
You're hot.

594
00:39:45,065 --> 00:39:46,245
我一直在注意你
I was watching you.

595
00:39:46,245 --> 00:39:47,295
真的吗
You were?

596
00:39:48,115 --> 00:39:50,575
你让我想整晚大干一场
You made me want to fuck all night.

597
00:39:53,365 --> 00:39:55,195
-你想换个地方吗　　　　　-你带路
-You want to get out of here? 　-You lead.

598
00:39:57,655 --> 00:39:59,445
我以为我们说好了
I thought we had plans.

599
00:40:00,735 --> 00:40:01,465
你本来可以表现好一点
You couldn't do better.

600
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:03,135
我也说过我也可能有安排的
I told you I might have plans too.

601
00:40:04,195 --> 00:40:05,405
他是怎麽回事
What's his problem?

602
00:40:06,085 --> 00:40:07,605
他只不过是我的跟屁虫
He's just my stalker.

603
00:40:07,995 --> 00:40:09,775
来个三人行也不错
I suppose we could have a three-way,

604
00:40:10,405 --> 00:40:12,375
只不过  他看起来有点老
only, he's kinda old.

605
00:40:14,045 --> 00:40:15,365
看起来我们也该走了
We're also kinda leaving.

606
00:40:19,145 --> 00:40:20,915
他是不是有点逊
Is he doing some kinda lame?

607
00:40:26,285 --> 00:40:27,415
不好意思
'scuse me,

608
00:40:27,475 --> 00:40:29,195
是谁一个小时前还在说
But aren't you the person who said about an hour ago

609
00:40:29,195 --> 00:40:30,735
他受够了这些无休止的
that they'd had enough of this pulsating,

610
00:40:30,735 --> 00:40:32,355
躁动的肉体  说宁愿回家呆着
grinding flesh and wanted to go home?

611
00:40:32,365 --> 00:40:34,255
-急什麽　　　　  -不是着急
-What's the rush?     -There's no rush.

612
00:40:34,255 --> 00:40:36,135
我只是觉得你不太享受夜店
I just thought you didn't approve.

613
00:40:36,135 --> 00:40:38,995
是你说的  对强壮光滑肉体的过分着迷
You know, all the misplaced emphasis on smooth, muscular bodies,

614
00:40:38,995 --> 00:40:41,725
对年轻男体的痴迷  肤浅的价值观
the obsession with youth, and the shallow values.

615
00:40:41,745 --> 00:40:43,295
也许我是有点太会批评了
Well, maybe I was being a little judgmental.

616
00:40:43,305 --> 00:40:44,955
我觉得这叫伪君子
Try hypocritical.

617
00:40:45,385 --> 00:40:48,075
-现在是谁太会批评了？            -实话实说而已
-Who's being judgmental now?　  -Just be honest.

618
00:40:48,365 --> 00:40:50,015
别老是批评别人怎样
Don't put someone down for doing something

619
00:40:50,015 --> 00:40:52,595
其实你一直都想做这些  就是没胆子做
you've always wished you could do, but didn't have the guts.

620
00:40:52,955 --> 00:40:54,295
我回家了
I'm going home.

621
00:40:54,555 --> 00:40:55,515
迈克
Michael.

622
00:41:01,355 --> 00:41:03,095
-那是迈克 　　　   -所以呢
-There's Michael.  　-So?

623
00:41:03,215 --> 00:41:04,315
所以...
Well so...

624
00:41:05,405 --> 00:41:07,095
你整晚都没见到他了  难道你不想
You haven't seen him all night. Don't you want to...

625
00:41:07,095 --> 00:41:10,055
我说过了  我想和你在一起
I already told you, I'd rather be with you.

626
00:41:12,245 --> 00:41:13,725
我知道  但是
I know, but...

627
00:41:17,145 --> 00:41:18,485
这样会不会有点
Is there some sort of...

628
00:41:18,775 --> 00:41:19,855
什麽
What?

629
00:41:20,655 --> 00:41:22,355
不妥  因为我
Problem? On account of me?

630
00:41:22,435 --> 00:41:23,815
-当然不是        -要是那样的话
-Of course not.  - 'Cause if there is,

631
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:25,965
我不想成为你和你朋友间的绊脚石
I don't want to come between you and your friends.

632
00:41:26,885 --> 00:41:28,005
你没有
You're not.

633
00:41:30,165 --> 00:41:32,015
就算你有  也不要紧
Even if you were, it wouldn't matter.

634
00:41:36,145 --> 00:41:37,115
听着
Look...

635
00:41:38,065 --> 00:41:39,525
别这麽说
Don't say that.

636
00:41:39,835 --> 00:41:42,015
我不想做什麽伤害你的事
I don't want to do anything to hurt you.

637
00:41:42,955 --> 00:41:43,585
要是想到
If I ever thought

638
00:41:43,585 --> 00:41:45,645
我成了你和你朋友间的绊脚石
I was going to come between you and your friends...

639
00:41:47,535 --> 00:41:49,645
如果我的朋友对你有意见
If a friend of mine has a problem with you,

640
00:41:50,445 --> 00:41:52,875
那只说明了他不是一个真正值得交的朋友
all it means is he was never really my friend to begin with.

641
00:43:02,635 --> 00:43:03,745
迈克
Michael!

642
00:43:05,155 --> 00:43:06,805
妈  茉蕾妮 你们在这儿干什麽
Ma, Melanie, what are you doing here?

643
00:43:06,805 --> 00:43:08,105
布莱恩在哪儿
Where's Brian?

644
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,715
我想也许你能帮上忙
I-I was hoping maybe you could help.

645
00:43:12,545 --> 00:43:13,305
我也想帮忙  黛比
Well, I would, Debbie,

646
00:43:13,305 --> 00:43:15,885
但是我不可能让银行在周六晚上开门
but I can't really open a bank on a Saturday night.

647
00:43:16,605 --> 00:43:18,245
信用卡行吗
Maybe credit cards?

648
00:43:18,255 --> 00:43:21,275
不  ATM最多只能提款500块
No, the maximum withdrawal at an atm is $500.

649
00:43:21,275 --> 00:43:23,885
我来处理吧　  他们收支票吗
I can cover it. Can they take a cheque?

650
00:43:23,975 --> 00:43:25,495
除非是(银行)保付支票
Only if it's certified.

651
00:43:25,495 --> 00:43:26,635
妈的
Shit!

652
00:43:26,715 --> 00:43:29,345
这事儿还能再他妈的更烦人吗
I mean, could they make it any more fucking difficult?

653
00:43:29,345 --> 00:43:31,945
我们必须要给个保释官打电话
Okay, you know what? We're going to have to call a bail bondsman.

654
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:47,805
打这个号码
If you call this number,

655
00:43:48,635 --> 00:43:50,015
提这个名字
mention this guy's name,

656
00:43:50,335 --> 00:43:51,905
他会付保证金的
He'll put up the bail for you.

657
00:43:53,075 --> 00:43:54,495
这是怎麽回事
What was that all about?

658
00:43:54,515 --> 00:43:56,175
我请迪诺帮忙的
I asked Dino for a favour.

659
00:43:58,775 --> 00:43:59,855
谢谢
Thank you.

660
00:44:01,145 --> 00:44:02,725
谢谢  你叫
Thank you, um...

661
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:04,175
布雷克
Blake.

662
00:44:04,175 --> 00:44:06,995
布雷克  谢谢  我是黛比
Blake. Ah, thank you, I'm Debbie.

663
00:44:07,735 --> 00:44:10,975
太谢谢你了
Oh! oh, oh, thank you!

664
00:44:11,805 --> 00:44:13,495
你这朋友可真有办法
That's some friend you've got.

665
00:44:13,725 --> 00:44:14,625
我也这麽想
I like to think so.

666
00:44:14,625 --> 00:44:16,155
谢谢你
Oh, thank you!

667
00:44:16,165 --> 00:44:17,435
你怎麽认识他的
Where'd you find him?

668
00:44:18,115 --> 00:44:19,505
说来话长  黛比
It's a long story, Deb.

669
00:44:19,765 --> 00:44:20,875
谢谢
Thanks.

670
00:44:21,195 --> 00:44:22,295
别客气
No problem.

671
00:44:24,265 --> 00:44:25,645
我很抱歉
I'm sorry if I've been...

672
00:44:26,675 --> 00:44:27,765
之前很不客气
Shitty.

673
00:44:29,025 --> 00:44:30,765
因为你关心泰德
It's because you care about Ted.

674
00:44:33,425 --> 00:44:34,555
我也是
So do I.

675
00:44:40,565 --> 00:44:41,865
我错过了什麽吗
Did I miss something?

676
00:44:42,065 --> 00:44:42,935
-没有    -什麽
- No.      -What?

677
00:44:42,935 --> 00:44:44,685
没事  没事
No. Nothing. Nothing.

678
00:44:45,545 --> 00:44:47,995
都搞定了  走吧
Okay, we're all set. Let's go.

679
00:44:48,195 --> 00:44:49,345
再次谢谢你
Thanks again!

680
00:44:56,505 --> 00:44:59,195
天啊  老姐  我让你别和别人说
Jesus christ, sis, I told you not to tell anyone.

681
00:44:59,195 --> 00:45:01,345
这没有什麽可不好意思的  维克叔叔
There's nothing to be ashamed of, Uncle Vic.

682
00:45:01,345 --> 00:45:02,815
我们知道你是清白的
We know you're innocent.

683
00:45:03,735 --> 00:45:05,595
我只是想回家  我们能回去了吗
I just want to go home. Can we please go home?

684
00:45:05,595 --> 00:45:07,295
当然  我现在就送你回去
Yes, I'll take you home right now.

685
00:45:07,675 --> 00:45:09,675
但是  你得先吃药
But first I want you to take your meds.

686
00:45:09,775 --> 00:45:11,605
一晚上我都在想办法把药给你
I've been trying to get your meds to you all night.

687
00:45:11,605 --> 00:45:14,395
没事的   柜台那个警官给我药了
It's all right, the desk sergeant gave me my pills.

688
00:45:25,725 --> 00:45:26,695
走吧
Let's go.

689
00:45:26,795 --> 00:45:28,955
我还是头一次见你这麽醋意大发
I don't think I've ever seen you so jealous.

690
00:45:28,955 --> 00:45:31,705
-我没有吃醋　　　-看看谁在说谎
- I am not jealous. 　 -Oh, now who's being dishonest?

691
00:45:31,705 --> 00:45:32,575
你会怎麽想
Well how would you feel

692
00:45:32,575 --> 00:45:35,295
如果你男友被全城甲甲们色迷迷地盯着
if your boyfriend was being ogled by every fag in town?

693
00:45:36,725 --> 00:45:38,325
他可常常被别人盯着看啊
It so happens he is.

694
00:45:38,325 --> 00:45:39,655
哦  变成是我被人看了
Oh, I am, yeah.

695
00:45:39,655 --> 00:45:42,315
经常有  只是你没注意过
Constantly. Only you never notice.

696
00:45:42,315 --> 00:45:45,225
是  是我的问题  同志雷达常出错
Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's my problem, faulty gaydar.

697
00:45:45,225 --> 00:45:46,555
我很幸运
Lucky for me.

698
00:45:46,965 --> 00:45:49,795
现在你证明了即使到了你这个年纪
So now that you've proven to everyone how hot you are

699
00:45:49,795 --> 00:45:51,625
也可以很性感   我想你现在
even at your age, I suppose you're going to...

700
00:45:52,035 --> 00:45:53,555
会天天晚上出去玩了
be out partying every night.

701
00:45:53,785 --> 00:45:55,045
不会每晚
Not every night.

702
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,185
不过我得承认  受人关注  知道自己
But it was nice to get the attention,

703
00:45:59,185 --> 00:46:02,635
还很有魅力  感觉还是挺不错的
to know I'm still attractive. I must admit,

704
00:46:02,915 --> 00:46:06,985
年轻男人那光滑紧实的身体  的确迷人
Hot young men with smooth, muscular bodies have a certain appeal.

705
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:09,785
但是还有其他东西
But there are other things.

706
00:46:10,535 --> 00:46:14,625
工作  我儿子  还有你
Work. My son... and you.

707
00:46:18,245 --> 00:46:21,635
那下次你没乾净衣服可穿   要换上这条裤子之前
So before you hang these jeans up until next laundry day,

708
00:46:21,635 --> 00:46:23,455
给我跳段热舞怎麽样
How about doing a little dance for me?

709
00:46:59,805 --> 00:47:01,155
这咖啡是给猪吃的
This coffee's for shit.

710
00:47:02,855 --> 00:47:05,655
贾斯汀现在是新一代巴比伦之王
So Justin's the new king of Babylon.

711
00:47:05,655 --> 00:47:08,665
长江後浪推前浪
So, the, uh, cub caught the lion's prey, hm.

712
00:47:09,675 --> 00:47:11,645
就算你想享受你的成功
Even though you'd like to rest on your laurels,

713
00:47:11,645 --> 00:47:13,525
保证的你的无上地位
secure in your position of power,

714
00:47:13,655 --> 00:47:15,695
但现在他们越追越紧
now you know they're snapping at your heels.

715
00:47:15,705 --> 00:47:17,785
而你需要加快速度奔跑
And you're going to have to run faster and faster...

716
00:47:17,785 --> 00:47:19,925
你他妈能不能把那罐糖递给我
So why don't you pass the fucking sugar?

717
00:47:21,435 --> 00:47:22,755
你应该为他骄傲
You should be proud of him.

718
00:47:23,335 --> 00:47:24,785
虎父无犬子
Like father, like son.

719
00:47:26,895 --> 00:47:28,145
那个是不是布伦特
Hey, isn't that Brent?

720
00:47:29,875 --> 00:47:30,965
布伦特是谁
Who's brent?

721
00:47:31,105 --> 00:47:32,515
艾美特的旧露水姻缘
Emmett's old flame.

722
00:47:35,205 --> 00:47:36,615
另外一个肯定是新欢了
Must be with his new love.

723
00:47:43,025 --> 00:47:44,335
你上哪去？
Where are you going?

724
00:47:51,105 --> 00:47:52,345
很久没见了
Been a long time.

725
00:47:53,655 --> 00:47:54,985
我很想你
I've thought of you...

726
00:47:55,955 --> 00:47:57,195
常常
Often.

727
00:47:57,725 --> 00:47:58,865
你看起来挺好的
You look good.

728
00:48:00,045 --> 00:48:01,215
你也是
You too.

729
00:48:03,425 --> 00:48:04,685
你有伴儿了吗
You seeing anyone?

730
00:48:05,765 --> 00:48:06,955
没
Not really.

731
00:48:07,785 --> 00:48:08,895
你呢
You?

732
00:48:10,735 --> 00:48:11,925
我们刚刚认识
We just met.

733
00:48:12,315 --> 00:48:13,825
那你今晚有空了
So you'll be free tonight.

734
00:48:15,115 --> 00:48:16,285
没准
Probably.

735
00:48:18,505 --> 00:48:19,845
-那你　　　　 -别
-Would you... 　-Don't!

736
00:48:21,695 --> 00:48:23,245
我们回不去了
We can't go back.

737
00:48:25,555 --> 00:48:27,065
我更倾向只是回忆
I prefer to remember...

738
00:48:29,105 --> 00:48:30,515
我们以前的时光
the way we were.

739
00:48:42,905 --> 00:48:44,255
向国王致敬
Hail to the king.

740
00:48:44,635 --> 00:48:45,795
昨晚太爽了
What a night.

741
00:48:46,685 --> 00:48:47,835
他怎麽样
So, how was he?

742
00:48:50,035 --> 00:48:51,495
他的小屁屁超级紧
He had the greatest ass.

743
00:48:51,985 --> 00:48:53,975
我带他到後面暗房  干了他一整晚
I brought him back, I fucked him all night.

744
00:48:54,425 --> 00:48:56,535
我想小贾斯汀要酸痛一整个星期了
I think my dick's going to be sore for a week.

745
00:48:56,535 --> 00:48:57,595
够了
That's enough.

746
00:48:57,665 --> 00:48:59,335
实际上  我还想听
Actually, I'd like to hear more.

747
00:48:59,335 --> 00:49:01,955
说清楚、讲明白
Speak slowly and enunciate.

748
00:49:03,965 --> 00:49:05,625
呃，他很会口交
Uh, he gave great head.

749
00:49:06,065 --> 00:49:08,235
他想我带着王冠干他
He wanted me to fuck him with my crown on.

750
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:09,645
有点变态
It's kind of kinky.

751
00:49:11,385 --> 00:49:13,285
过了一会儿　  他开始想赖着不走了
After a while though, he got really clingy.

752
00:49:13,715 --> 00:49:15,885
他问我他什麽时候还能见到我
He wanted to know when he could see me again...

753
00:49:19,515 --> 00:49:20,925
你怎麽说的
So what'd you tell him?

754
00:49:23,965 --> 00:49:27,915
我说你可以在梦里见我   (Brian曾在101对Justin说过)
I told him that he could see me in his dreams.

755
00:49:39,285 --> 00:49:41,395
谁准备去「最猛腹肌大赛」？
Who's up for the Absolute abs contest?
