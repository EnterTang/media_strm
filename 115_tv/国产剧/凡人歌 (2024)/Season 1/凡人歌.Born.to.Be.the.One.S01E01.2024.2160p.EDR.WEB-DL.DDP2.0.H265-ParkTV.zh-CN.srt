Ten days in the Dordogne.

It's going to be Katie, Alex,
Rory, Biscuit, Douglas, and Fran.

24
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,200
And me.

25
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,936
- And you, Dexy, if you come. Will you?
- Hi, Dexy, darling.

26
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,880
Hello.

27
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,600
Don't go away.

28
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,520
- Have you sealed the deal, then?
- Shh. He'll hear.

29
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,080
And he's just carrying out
all them moves.

30
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,160
What about that one
on The Meadows?

31
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,200
I have never laughed so much.

32
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,480
I'm still laughing.

33
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,400
They're probably still there.

34
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,000
Dexy!

35
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,960
Okay. Tell me that you're coming
to France with the Marlborough lot.

36
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,120
Um... I'm not sure yet.

37
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,240
Caroline is keen, Dexy.
That's all I'll say.

38
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,720
And Annabel, but no surprises there.
Dinner in London, yeah?

39
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,936
- Dinner in London.
- To the last day of uni.

40
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,040
- Ever!
- Wait. Do it to the end.

41
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,360
"The end"?
What kind of a toast is "the end"?

42
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,280
All right, then. To the beginning.

43
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,160
To the beginning!

44
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,320
- To the rest of our lives. Whoa. Uh...
- Oh. Emma, you've pulled.

45
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,840
Who is that?

46
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,560
Dunno. But I bet he's doing...

47
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,880
...physics.

48
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,360
Wakey-wakey.

49
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,200
- Oh.
- Hi.

50
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,280
Hi.

51
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,800
- Cal.
- Hmm?

52
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,720
Callum?

53
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,720
But, Mommy,
it's not a school night.

54
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,120
Hi, Dex.

55
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,520
You feeling all right?

56
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,160
Mm-hmm. Mm.

57
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,360
Just going for a wazz.

58
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,920
All right.

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,280
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

60
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,560
What a charming encounter.

61
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,960
Uh, sorry about that.

62
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,960
It's not your fault.

63
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,960
Are you all right?

64
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,040
Entirely.

65
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,280
Drink?

66
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,600
Um...

67
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,040
Okay.

68
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,200
You're an unlikely pair,
you and physics boy.

69
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,440
I... I think you'll find
that was 18 stone of computer science.

70
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,520
How do you know each other?

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,480
We lived next door in halls.

72
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,760
Ah, yeah, where the magic happens.

73
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,680
Yeah. That's where I met Tilly.

74
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,040
Oh my God!

75
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,200
I'm Dexter, by the way.

76
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,440
Yeah, I know.

77
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,880
I've seen you around.

78
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,680
I've seen you around too.

79
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,120
Dex, mate.

80
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,920
Thank you, Magnus.

81
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,520
Uh, we... we smuggled in a couple of cases.

82
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,120
Of all the rah things.

83
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,040
Well, should I get you
a pint of snakebite?

84
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,120
Oh my God.

85
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,600
What?

86
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,200
A snakebite, though.

87
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,200
Now I really wanna find a snakebite.

No. She's, uh, the sister

What's your plan?

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,880
Do you usually ask
for a breakdown in advance?

137
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,240
Um, I mean, for your life.

138
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,320
The plan for your life.

139
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,800
Oh God.

140
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,000
Right. Okay.

141
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,160
Uh...

142
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,720
My parents are here
for graduation, obviously, and...

143
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,280
...they're driving my stuff back.

144
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,160
- So I'll stay in London for a few days.
- Uh-huh.

145
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,280
See some friends.

146
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,600
And, uh... then France.

147
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,880
And then China, maybe.

148
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,440
You know, see what that's all about.

149
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,560
Then India.

150
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,440
What?

151
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,640
That's your plan for the future?
Just go on holiday?

152
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,920
No, it's not a holiday. It's travel.

153
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,200
- Travel?
- Yeah, travel.

154
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,576
- Could you stop saying "travel"?
- What's wrong with travel?

155
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,320
No, nothing, I suppose.

156
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,480
You know, if you can afford it
and you don't mind, you know,

157
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,840
avoiding reality.

158
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,760
Well...

159
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,440
I think reality is overrated.

160
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,360
What a ridiculous statement.

161
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,000
And I didn't mean,
"What are you doing next month?"

162
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,000
I meant, like, the <i>future</i> future.

163
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,800
When you're, I don't know,
40 or something.

164
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,480
What do you wanna be when you're 40?

165
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,680
I don't know. Not 40?

166
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,840
Am I allowed to say "rich"?

167
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,760
All right, then. Famous.

168
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,400
- A bit morbid, this, isn't it?
- It's not morbid. It's exciting.

169
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,000
"Exciting."

170
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,720
Are you from Manchester?

171
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,520
No.

172
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,080
- Sheffield?
- No.

173
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,840
- Wigan?
- No.

174
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,920
Warrington.

175
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,080
I know what you're doing.

176
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,720
You're naming all the stations you pass
through on the train up from London.

177
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,480
But I bet you've never so much
as set foot in the north.

178
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Newcastle.

179
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,320
Leeds.

180
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,800
Leeds!

181
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,400
And what happens in Leeds?

182
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,480
Nothing. Not to me, anyway.

183
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,680
What do you wanna do?

184
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,360
Uh, change things.

185
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,000
Do something
that actually makes a difference.

186
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,920
Like change the world, you mean?

187
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,800
Yeah. Not the <i>whole</i> world.

188
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,960
Maybe just my own tiny corner of it.

189
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,400
I can imagine you at 40.

190
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,600
Can you?

191
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,080
Go on, then.

192
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,280
Okay.

193
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,240
It's 2005,

194
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,120
and you're in this tiny, tiny sports car
with the roof down,

195
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,160
in Kensington or Chelsea
or one of those places.

196
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,400
Excellent. Carry on.

197
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,960
Um, and you've got

198
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,200
this little paunch that you've tucked away
under the steering wheel.

199
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,360
No paunch.

200
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,520
And the wind's blowing
through your widow's peak,

201
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,840
and you're feeling
very, very pleased with yourself.

202
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,760
And wife number three, or is it four,

203
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,160
smiles at you
with about 200 shiny white teeth,

204
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,080
and you smile back,
whilst trying not to think about the fact

205
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,120
that she's thick as mince,
and you've got nothing,

206
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,280
absolutely nothing, to say to each other.

I'm gonna chat.

00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,880
- Chat?
- I'm gonna get to know him.

266
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,000

267
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,360
Mm. Nice gown.

268
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,520
We call this look
"Academia by Night."

269
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,320
It cost 30 quid to hire.
Gotta get my money's worth.

270
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,320
Now, take it off and come back to bed.

271
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,680

280
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,840

are having it turned into wallpaper.

281
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,080
It's so late. No more talking.

282
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,960
Do you know... you know
there's nothing sexier than talking?

283
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,200
Uh, arguably, sex, but...

284
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,080
Um...

285
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,000
Okay.

286
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,160
Let's talk.

287
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,480
I love that sound.

288
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,800

289
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,000

290
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,360

291
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,000
No.

292
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,400
No, it makes me anxious.

293
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,800
Like I've done something
I'll regret.

294
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,000
That's why I love it.

295
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,840
Have you?

296
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,560
Have I what?

297
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,600
Done something that you'll regret.

298
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,800
Don't know yet. Ask me in the morning.

299
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,920
I think it is the morning.

300
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,120
Yeah.

301
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,040
Have you

302
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,880
done something you'll regret?

303
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
No.

304
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,760
We should try and get some sleep.

305
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,080
Why?

306
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,760
Nothing tomorrow.

307
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,480
Just the whole
of our lives stretching out.

308
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,840
Oh. You off, then?

309
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,760
I didn't wanna wake you.

310
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,600
Um, I was...
I was going to leave you a note,

311
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,120
but I... I couldn't find a pen.

312
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,040
No, it's fine.
Yeah, you can leave whenever you want.

313
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,600
Yeah. Um...

314
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,520
You see, my parents are here, and...
and we're heading back this morning.

315
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,640
I was quite drunk
last night.

316
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,080
I... I had a really nice time.

317
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,680
Yeah, I can tell from the way
you're searching for your shoes.

318
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,040
Yeah.

319
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,160
No. I... I, um... I mean it.

320
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,680
I'm glad we finally met
and talked and the other stuff.

321
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,720
Mm. Under the bed.

322
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,040
- What?
- Your shoe.

323
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,680
Oh.

324
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,880
I really was gonna write you a note.

325
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,640
What was it gonna say, this precious note?

326
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,360
It was gonna say,
"I've stolen your purse."

327
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,000
You'd find it tragically empty,
I'm afraid.

328
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,640
Mm.

329
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,520
Well, now where are you going?

330
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,280
To shower, get dressed.

331
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,160
Will you be here when I get back,
or should I say bye now?

332
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,000
Uh...

333
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,560
Well, do you know what?
I, um...

334
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,240
I might see if we can leave later.

335
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,520
Mm?

336
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,320
So did you?

337
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,480
Tell me!

338
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,320
Did you have sex with Dexter Mayhew?

339
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,040
Tell me now!

340
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,400
No.

341
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,800
So, what <i>did</i> you do?

342
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,960
Uh, we just... we talked and stuff.

343
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,080
Stuff?

344
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,360
Stuff?

345
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,640
What, hand stuff? Mouth stuff?

346
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,120
Foot stuff?

347
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,400
Em, no!

348
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,280
Don't you dare walk out on me!
Just tell me more.

349
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,920
- What does he smell like?
- Shh!

350
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,720
<i>At the third stroke, the time...</i>

351
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,560
<i>- ...9:32 and...</i>
- Uh...

352
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,880
Hi, Mom. It's... me. Um...

353
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,160
Is it okay if we leave a bit later today?

354
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,600
<i>...will be 9:32 and 20...</i>

355
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,920
Yeah, okay.

356
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,800
Don't change your plans.
If you've gotta go home, that's fine.

357
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,600
Oh no, it's fine.

358
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,640
Ah, amazing.

359
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,200
Okay, great.

360
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,560
Thanks. Yeah. Okay.
See you back at the flat.

361
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,680
Done.

362
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,040
Mm.

363
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,840
That's...

364
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,600
Hi.

365
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,920
Oh, hi!

366
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,640
Um, I'm Tilly.

367
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,600
Have we met?

368
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,040
Dexter.

369
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,800
Hi, Dexter.

370
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,400
Tilly.

371
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,200
Right. Uh, breakfast?

372
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,800

00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,520
Emma got a first.
Do you know she got a first?

378
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,840
- Tilly!
- She already told me.

379
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,520
I didn't tell you. You opened my scroll.

380
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,240
"Opened my scroll."

381
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,360
So,

382
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,000
what shall we do with the day?

383
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,280
The first day of our properly adult lives.

384
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,560
Ooh. We should go out for lunch.

385
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,000
No. No. It's a gorgeous day.
We should be outside.

386
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,560
- Portobello beach? Oh, let's go swimming.
- No.

387
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,240
Emma hates wearing a swimming costume,
but she has a lovely figure.

388
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,320
She does.

389
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,720
Let's climb Arthur's Seat.

390
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,360
Well, never done it.

391
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,160
You've never climbed Arthur's Seat?

392
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,280
You've been here four years,
and you've never climbed Arthur's Seat?

393
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,800
I've been busy.

394
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,120
Doing what?

395
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,480
Studying anthropology.

396
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,440
Right. Let's go.

397
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,520
Oh, we could take a picnic.

00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,360
I need to...

403
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,160
feed the guinea pig.

404
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,840
Are you all right back there?

405
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,560
Yeah, good.

406
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,000
Should I alert search and rescue?

407
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,320
It's the shoes.

408
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,160
I just wish they had more grip.

409
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,080
Is it the shoes?

410
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,240
Are we really going
all the way to the top?

411
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,400
It's not K2.

412

You're very nimble.

413

414

What are we gonna do
when we get to the top?

415
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,280

416
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,560
Here we go.

417
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,760

418
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,360

- Uh, no. Not for me, thanks.
- Okay.

427
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,360

- Oh no, I'm fine for now. Thanks.

428
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,520
To one-night stands.

429
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,880
Are we drinking
to one-night stands in the future?

430
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,480
Because we didn't actually have one.

431
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,960
Yeah. No. Uh, no.

432
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,520
Is that a religious thing,
not sleeping together?

433
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,320
Hmm. Okay. Right.

434
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,880
So unimaginable, is it, that someone
might decline to have sex with you

435
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,840
that it could only be explained
as an order from God himself?

436
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,440
Shut up. No, it's just a question. I mean...

437
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,560
Maybe a stupid question, but...

438
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,720
My mom's Hindu,
and my dad's a lapsed Catholic.

439
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,360
So, no.

440
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,640
God wasn't involved.

441
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,080
I hope it doesn't feel
like a night wasted.

442
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,680
It wasn't a night wasted.
It was memorable.

443
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,040
Not having sex with you
was highly memorable.

444
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,360
What are you doing?

445
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,920
What does it look like?
I... am taking a picture.

446
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,640
Something to remember you by.

447
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,480
Oh, I look terrible. Hold on.

448
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,640
Okay. Cheese.

449
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,400
Oh no, not cheese.

450
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,560
Well, then, what?
Thieves that pass in the night?

451
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,440
Thieves don't pass in the night.

452
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,440
- That's ships.
- What do thieves do?

453
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,880
- Thieves are thick.
- So rude!

454

- Oh.

455

- What's that?

00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,480
15th of July.

If it rains today,
it's gonna rain all summer.

458

492
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,720
In the room.
I phoned through to the room.

493
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,560
Mm.

494
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,640
Not a single one of these
seems to work.

495
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,600
Uh, this is my friend, Emma.

496
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,000
- Pleased to meet you, Emma. I'm Alison.
- Hi.

497
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,680
None of them.
Not a single bloody one of them.

498
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,960
And this is Stephen.

499
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,000
- Pleased to meet you.
- Yeah. You too.

500
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,880
Well, where have you two been all day?

501
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,640
I need to move the bloody car.

502
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,400
Oh...

503
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,360
Do you want to come in for a drink, or...

504
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,040
Or dinner.
Why don't you join us for dinner?

505
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,840
Uh...

506
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:20,040
Thank you. Uh, thank you,
but, um, I've got to get back. Um...

507
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,560
Are... Are you sure?

508
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,080
Yeah. Yeah.

509
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:28,400
Um, yeah, I'll see you around, maybe.
It was really nice to meet you.

510
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,120
- You too, Emily.
- Emma.

511
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,000
Emma. I'm so sorry.

512
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,440
Goodbye, Emma.

513
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,680
Well, have a nice life.

514
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,760
Yeah. Yeah, you too.

515
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,040
Have a nice life.

516
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,280
Oh...

517
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,480
Has she gone?

518
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:00,040
Sorry, Dexter. Did we interrupt something?

519
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,120
No, no, no... She's, uh... She's...

520
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,880
She's just a friend.

521
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,800
Emily!

522
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,160
I thought I'd lost you.

523
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,600
Sorry. They, uh...

524
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,400
They weren't meant to come down
until later.

525
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,800
And then I realized I don't have any...
any way of getting in touch with you.

526
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,320
- Oh, um...
- I don't have a pen.

527
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,040
Yeah. Hang on.

528
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,240
- You must have a pen.
- A pen!

529
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,680
Um...

530
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,080
Okay. So, uh... call me.

531
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,480
Or I'll call you.

532
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,400
Either way, one of us will call. Uh...

533
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,160
It doesn't... It doesn't matter who.
It's... It's not a...

534
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,000
It's not a competition,
is what I'm saying.

535
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,000
- You don't lose by calling.
- Yeah, I understand.

536
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,600
Okay. Here you go.

537
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,200
Um, I'm going to France until August,

538
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:36,240
and then I'm back, and I thought... thought
maybe you'd wanna come down and stay.

539
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,320
With you?

540
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,800
Yeah. Well, at my parents'.

541
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,840
I mean, not forever.

542
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,960
Just for a weekend.

543
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,640
- You don't have to.
- Yes! Yes. Uh...

544
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,480
- Uh, yeah, I'd like to. I will. Yeah.
- All right.

545
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,080
So...

546
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,280
So...

547
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,920
See you around.

548
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,600
Yeah, I hope so.

549
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,040
I hope so too.

550
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,920
Bye, Em.

551
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Bye, Dex.

552
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,160
- Bye.
- Yeah, bye.
