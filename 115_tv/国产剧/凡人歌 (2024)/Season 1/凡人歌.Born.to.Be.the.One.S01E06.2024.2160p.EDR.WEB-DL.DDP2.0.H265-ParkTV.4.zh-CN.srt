同志亦凡人 Queer As Folk S01E06

好吧  我是个崇拜超级英雄的同志
Okay, so i'm a gay man with a superhero fetish.

5
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,450
是的  的确有我们这种人    不过
Yes, we're out there. And no, it doesn't

6
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,000
我们并不是不成熟
Have anything to do with immaturity.

7
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,000
我认为我们同志们能从漫画书里
I think we gay boys learn important

8
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,510
学到很多东西
Lessons from comic books.

9
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,090
第一  世界上有很多坏人
One, there are a lot of villains out there,

10
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,090
所以你最好拥有几样秘密超能力
So you better develop some secret powers.

11
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,210
第二  你想穿紧身衣  你身材要够好
Two, if you have a good body, you can wear tight clothes.

12
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:04,480
第三  最好是有个跟班或夥伴一起行动　(例如蝙蝠侠和罗宾)
And, three it's always good to be part of a dynamic duo.

13
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,070
我完全的搞砸了
I totally blew it.

14
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,860
放心  外面还有很多怪叔叔
Don't worry. There's still plenty of creepy old

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,010
等着要上你
Who'd love to get in your pants.

16
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,400
他没那麽老
He wasn't that old.

17
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,140
他也没那麽怪   他很棒   可是我第一次跟医生约会
He wasn't creepy. He was nice. My first doctor.

18
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,480
-理疗师而已　　 -也算是医生… 我想是吧
-Chiropractor.   -That counts... I think.

19
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,580
新的《猫女》出刊罗
Uh, we got in the new catwoman.

20
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,040
酷
Cool.

21
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,760
他带我去一间很不错的餐厅
He takes me to this really nice restaurant,

22
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,940
我却像个傻屌
And I behave like a fucking idiot,

23
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,110
打扮得油里油气的傻屌
Dressed up like some slick asshole.

24
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,510
嘿   那件皮夹克可是花了我三万六
Hey, that was my $1,200 leather jacket.

25
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,910
那不适合我的型
It wasn't me.

26
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,010
你知道吗?
You know why?

27
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,910
因为我什麽咖都不是...
'Cause I'm nobody. That's my problem.

28
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,770
你到底有没有听我说话?
Are you even listening to me?

29
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,780
这些自怨自怜的话我会自动消音　我没"性"趣
I tune out self-pity. It makes my dick soft.

30
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,670
我们可不想失去"性"趣...
And we wouldn't want that...

31
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,200
是吧
Would we?

32
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,520
就当我刚才什麽都没说
Just forget I said anything.

33
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,020
喔 你看
Oh, wow. Look.

新的幻影女杀手公仔　 (《夜魔侠》漫画的反派)
It's the new electra woman doll.

35
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,070
我买这个给盖斯
I'm going to buy this for Gus.

36
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,070
不要   我不想要他变成同志少年
Don't. I don't want a gay kid.

37
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,730
两个拉拉在抚养他
He's being raised by two lesbians.

38
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,940
他需要一些女人味的东西
He's going to need a feminine influence.

39
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,440
况且   这个当收藏品也不错
Besides, it'll be a collector's item.

40
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,620
我拿去吧   我等下要去她们家
I'll take it. I'm going over there.

41
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,490
我也要去  不行
I'll go too.  No.

42
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,380
你回去找那个医生
You're going back to the doctor.

43
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,810
叫他再给你一次机会
Tell him you want to give it another try.

44
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,780
你妈妈知道你跑出来买首饰吗?
Does your mom know you're out buying jewelry?

45
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,490
她什麽都不管的
Oh, she's totally cool with everything.

46
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,570
至少她假装不管我  因为她害怕
Or at least she's pretending to be because she's scared

47
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,100
-我会离家出走 然後去当发型师　　　　　-我恨你
-I'll run away and become a hairdresser.  -I hate you.

48
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,090
我都还没解释什麽的
My mom's such a bitch, and I haven't

49
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,190
我妈就开始噜嗦一大堆了
Even given her a reason yet.

50
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,150
-这个如何?　　　　　-基味十足
-How about these?   -They're totally queer.

51
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:59,730
闭嘴　　这是我们友情的象徵
Shut up. They're a symbol of our friendship.

52
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,100
好吧  谢谢
Okay. Thanks.

53
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,780
事实上　我没带钱
Actually, I don't have any money.

54
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,290
我得存钱买假身份证
I had to buy a new fake i.d.

55
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,290
你看  是她们
Look! That's them!

56
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,130
布莱恩的拉拉朋友
Brian's lesbians.

57
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,500
嘿  你们好
Hey! Hey, How's it going?

58
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:29,080
不好意思  我们认识吗?   我是贾斯汀
I'm sorry. Do we know you?   I'm justin.

59
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,620
布莱恩的朋友
Brian's friend.

60
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,000
盖斯出生那晚我在场   我还帮忙决定他的名字
I was there the night Gus was born. I named him.

61
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,000
哦  是的
Oh, right. Yeah.

62
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,030
等他在加油站工作   我们还得谢谢你呢 (Gus, Gas同音)
So when Gus ends up pumping gas, we'll have you to thank.

63
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,170
这是达芙妮
This is Daphne.

64
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,280
你好  我不是拉拉    不过我很崇拜你们
Hi. I'm not a lesbian, but I-I'm a big fan.

65
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,320
他都长这麽大了
He's gotten so big already.

66
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,970
整天吃饱了就睡   你也会长得这麽大
You would too if all you did was sleep and eat all day.

67
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,980
的确如此    他是我见过最可爱的宝宝
He does.  He's like the cutest baby I've ever seen.

68
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,530
如果你需要临时保姆...
If you need a baby-sitter

69
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,270
除非你是认真的  不然别随口说说
Don't say that unless you mean it.

70
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,990
那你有什麽东西要搬到车上
And if you need any help carrying stuff to the car,

71
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,990
我可以帮忙
I'd be glad to be of assistance.

72
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:05,000
哇…　你还真帮得上忙呢
Wow, you're good for 1,001 uses.

73
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,590
我们等会见吗?    我不确定
I'll see you later?   I don't know

74
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,220
我不干了
I'm out.

75
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,170
工作吗?  太赞了
At work? That's fabulous.

76
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,360
我的意思是离开那些地方
Out of the scene, I mean.

77
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,360
我已经决定了
I've made up my mind.

78
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,860
不去酒吧  不去三温暖  不去夜店
No more bars, no more baths, no more clubs.

79
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,860
你不会在巴比伦看到我了
You'll never see my face at Babylon again.

80
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,470
拜托  你不能就因为那次
Oh, please! You can't let one little

81
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,860
一点嗑药的小意外就被击败了
Drug-induced coma get you down.

82
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,260
这件你觉得如何
What do you think?

83
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,470
你看起来很廉价
You look unbelievably trashy.

84
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,510
说的我心动了   买了
Talked me into it. I'll buy it.

85
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,100
你没听懂我的意思
You missed my point entirely.

86
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,140
我们做的每件事  甚至我们穿的衣服
Everything we do, even the clothes we wear,

87
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,160
都是有意无意地　有时还很刻意地
Is a conscious, or worse yet,

88
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,990
为了可以打一炮而穿成这样
Unconscious attempt to get laid.

89
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,500
的确   太强调"性"的部份
Yes, it's true. There is an overemphasis on sex.

90
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,000
为什麽不直接买小二号的衣服穿上？
But why not buy two sizes too small and go with it?

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,500
因为很不幸的   有人天生就无法这麽紧身的莱卡
Because, tragically, some of us were not born to wear lycra.

92
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,310
看看交友版吧
Here, check out the personals.

93
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,620
或许可以找到不爱外出鬼混的另一半
Perhaps you'll find someone to not go out with.

94
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,000
有件事  我一直搞不懂   这些广告
You know, one thing I never understood about these ads,

95
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,670
为什麽老写着 "舔乳头"  和 "活塞运动" 这些字眼?
Why is it always "tit work" and "ass play"?

96
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,680
如果你问我   这些实在很难让人.....
If you ask me, it's a lot harder to

97
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,060
看这个广告... 地点在同志文化中心
Hey, look at this...at the center

98
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,560
"佳人有约" 想跟其他的单身同志联谊
Date Bait. Meet other single gay men

99
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,070
共度一个高雅的交流之夜
"In a civilized evening of conversation.

100
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:14,070
不是路边钓男人   不会被当面拒绝
No pick-ups, no face-to-face rejection."

101
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,750
-他们有个"三十而立之夜"　　　　-在哪?  太平间吗?
-They have an over-30 night.　-Where? At the morgue?

102
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,750
因为你说了这句    你要跟我一起去
Just for that, you're going with me.

103
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,200
我又还没 30岁
I am not over 30.

104
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,740
那我也不会一个人去
And I am not going alone.

105
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,750
我不记得我们还有安排复诊时间
I didn't realize we had scheduled a follow-up visit.

106
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,750
是没有   我说我要挂急诊
We didn't. I told them it was an emergency.

107
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,000
-问题出在哪？　　　　 -出在我是个混蛋
-What's the problem? -I'm a jerk.

108
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,570
你能治疗这症状吗?
Can you adjust that?

109
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,810
有监於这不是持续性的病症
Provided it's not a permanent condition.

110
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,610
老实跟你说吧　  我不太跟人约会
See, the thing is, I don't date very often.

111
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,110
我是说  那种 "吃饭、聊天"
You know, real "eat a meal, talk,

112
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:54,110
"含情脉脉注视对方" 的传统约会
Stare into each other's eyes" kind of dates.

113
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,120
所以我那天有点反常
So I-I kind of freaked.

114
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,620
抱歉  我当时表现得像个大傻屌
And I'm sorry I was such an asshole.

115
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,620
你没有表现得像...  大傻屌
You weren't... an asshole.

116
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,630
相信我  我看过很多的傻屌..
Believe me, I've seen assholes and..

117
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,630
我是说...
I mean, uh..

118
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,630
我觉得自已很白烂
I feel shitty about it.

119
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:16,130
我真的喜欢你
And... I really like you.

120
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,640
我想你也许真的喜欢我
And I think you might actually have liked me.

121
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,640
-我真的喜欢你   -真的吗?
-I do like you.   -You do?

122
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,640
那你觉得我们可以重新开始吗?
Well, do you think we could start over?

123
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,650
坐下
Sit down.

124
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,670
你真的很可爱   你知道吗?
You're adorable, you know that?

125
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:57,180
我带了这个给盖斯
I got something for Gus.

126
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,680
太贴心了
That's so sweet.

127
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,180
我们等一下会打电话谢谢 "迈克"
We'll call Michael later to thank him.

128
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,100
你什麽时候开始学画画?
How long have you been drawing?

129
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,520
我还是婴儿的时候
My mom brought me crayons when I was

130
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,760
我妈就买了蜡笔给我   我就一直画到现在
Still in the crib. I never stopped.

131
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,390
他在这里干嘛?
What's he doing here?

132

我想让自己年轻一点　性感一些
I wanted to seem young and sexy

181

所以我就喝了它
So I took some,

182
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:30,650
结果我就陷入昏迷　  然後...
And I ended up in a coma. And, uh...

183

有个人在等我回家
To come home to after rehearsal.

185
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,600
而现在
Now...

186
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,420
我想找一段以认真交往为基础的恋情
I'm looking for a relationship based on something real.

187
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,000
我想这里也许有人
And I thought maybe there might be someone

188
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,420
和我有同样的想法
Here who's looking for the same thing.

189
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,930
呃   大概就这样
And, uh, that's all.

190
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,510
傻屌、傻屌摆满桌　没有一根我想要
Faggots, faggots everywhere and not a drop to drink.

191
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,030
坦白说  这里没一个人能
I can honestly say I have no desire

192
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,240
挑起我的性慾
To have sex with any of these people.

193
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,450
我也是
Me neither.

194
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,060
总算是有个起头吧
It's a start.

195
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,030
我从没见过这麽多的漫画
I've never seen so many comic books.

196
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,050
我带回家的每个人都这麽说
That's what everybody I bring home says.

197
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,140
我是说... 曾有人这样说  (怕被误会钓很多人)
I mean... people have told me that.

198
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,640
这个大块头是谁?
Who's the big fella?

199
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,050
Captain astro.

200
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,250
我那朋友  艾美特  他和我住一起
Um, my friend Emmett, he's staying with me.

201
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,260
本来是暂时性的
It was supposed to be a temporary thing

202
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,320
不过他有点反客为主了
But he became sort of a squatter

203
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,330
不好意思　他随时都有可能回来
He may come home at any time, so sorry about that.

204
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,540
你不用每件事都道歉的
You don't have to apologize for everything.

205
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,210
我知道    我常这样   抱歉
I know. I do that. I'm sorry.

206
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,810
想喝点什麽吗?  果汁?
Do you want anything? Juice?

207
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,820
啤酒?
Beer.

208
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,320
我没有红酒..
I don't have any wine.

209
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,840
慢一点
Slow.

210
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,120
嘿   你们想好要吃什麽了吗?
Hi, guys. You know what you'd like?

211
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,310
我要培根起士汉堡
I'll have the bacon cheeseburger,

212
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,420
中号薯条  还有百事可乐
Medium fries, and, uh, a pepsi.

213
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,430
好的
Okay.

214
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,930
嗯  我要..
Uh, I'll have the, uh,

215
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:21,430
烤鲔鱼  还有
Uh, the grilled tuna and, um... I, uh...

216
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,930
ㄟ  一杯水
Just... I-I'll have water.

217
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,940
拜托  放松一点好吗
Oh, come on. live a little.

218
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,440
我看得出来你亏待自己很久了
I can tell you've been denying yourself for way too long.

219
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,440
好吧  我点跟他一样的
All right, give me what he's having.

220
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,450
好的  马上就来
Okay, coming right up.

221
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,950
他笑起来很好看
He has a nice smile.

222
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,560
没有其他特别的吗
Among other attributes.

223
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,240
我肯定他很优秀
I'm sure he's a fine person.

224
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,910
我猜他拿过罗氏奖学金
Rhodes scholar would be my guess.

225
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,220
你知道吗  通常我会在他回来之前
You know, ordinarily I'd be wracking my brain

226
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,170
绞尽脑汁想一些
To come up with some

227
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,220
很烂的搭讪台词
Pathetic line for when he comes back.

228
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,220
比如  "之前没见过你，你是新来的吗？  "
Like, "I haven't seen you here before. Are you new ?"

229
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,680
或者  "我们之前好像在哪见过?"
Or, uh, "Do I know you from somewhere?

230
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,230
"没有吗?   那肯定是在梦里了"
No? Must be a dream.

231
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,600
"什麽时候这里开始找男模来打工了?"
"So when did they start hiring models here?"

232
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,350
你的比我的还烂   我该去洗手间吗?
You're worse than I am. You, um, want me to go

233
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,720
好让你有机会搭讪他   或是
To the men's room so you can take a crack at him, or

234
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,730
我的老天  省省吧　这种台词从没成功过
Oh, god no! It never worked anyway.

235
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,330
全是些没用的调情烂招
All that useless flirting.

236
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,000
跳脱那种只追求帅哥的世界
It is such a relief

237
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:17,770
真让人松了一口气
To be out of that world.

238
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,750
我必须跟你坦白一件事
I have a confession to make.

239
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:21,990
我去"佳人有约"
I didn't go to "date bait" just to

240
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,490
不只是为了多找几个人来参加
Drum up an audience

241
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:26,990
-我们第500场的桑德海姆音乐会　-我了解
-For our 500 Sondheim concert.   -I had a feeling.

242
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:30,000
我想找一个和我互相交流的人
I was hoping that I would find someone I could connect to.

243
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,000
-一个聊的来的人　　　　　-没错
-Someone appropriate.　-Exactly.

244
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,130
一个彼此适合的人
Someone appropriate.

245
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,130
所以
Well...

246
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:41,130
我想我们可以先了解对方  然後...
I say let's get to know each other and...

247
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,120
顺其自然
See what happens.

248
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,790
慢慢来
Take it slow.

249
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,470
我也喜欢慢板多过快板
I always preferred andante to presto anyway.

250
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,050
好了  两位
Okay, boys.

251
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,460
这饮料给你们降温一下
These'll help cool you down.

252
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,470
在我的乳头上搞了27分钟     我有计时
27 minutes on my nipples! I clocked it.

253
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,970
我是说  我希望他手也别闲着
I mean, I expected him to know what to do with his hands,

254
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,070
毕竟这是他的本职　　　(理疗师双关语)
'Cause that's his business,

255
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,620
不过他舌头真是超灵活的
But he has the most talented tongue.

256
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,620
-每一次我高潮的时候　-每一次?
-Every time I came　　-Every time ?

257
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,230
他都会还继续
He would just keep on going.

258
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,830
舔我的    每一个部位
Licking me... everywhere.

259
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,980
我认识一个人  他可以
I once knew a guy who could tie a cherry

260
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,330
用舌头把樱桃梗打结
Stem into a knot with his tongue.

261
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,250
我当时还有点怕他帮我口交
I was afraid to let him blow me.

262
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,560
27分钟?
27 minutes?

263
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,740
每个乳头舔13分钟半   还是...
W-was that 13 1/2 on each nipple, or...?

264
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,410
右边16分钟  左边11分钟
16 right, 11 left.

265
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,410
喔   说不定他勃起就需要这麽久
Yeah, that's probably how long it takes him to get it up.

266
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,110
这我不清楚
I wouldn't know.

267
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,920
我没看过它软下来
I never saw it when it was down.

268
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,140
又是一个 威尔钢 的亲身见证
Another viagra success story.

269
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,230
你今晚要带他去伍迪吗?
So are you bringing him to woody's tonight?

270
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,240
他好像不怎麽爱去酒吧
He's not really into the bar scene.

271
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,030
那他喜欢什麽?
Well what is he into?

272
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,540
他自己的生活吧
His life.

273
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,000
就像我现在约会的这个
Like the guy I met.

274
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:54,520
-你在跟人约会？　　　-他人很好
-You met someone?   -He's very nice.

275
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,890
很聪明  也很风趣
Very intelligent, very interesting.

276
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,390
是一号还是零号?
Is he a top or a bottom?

277
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,060
你知道吗   并不是所有人都跟你一样
You know, not everybody judges

278
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,560
看人只在乎1或0号
People by your criteria.

279
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,060
-罗杰和我    　 -罗杰?
-Roger and I...   -Roger?

280
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,070
罗杰和我已经决定
Roger and I have decided

281
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,570
在我们上床之前   要先好好认识彼此
To get to know each other before we have sex.

282
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,270
你以为你们是拉拉吗?
What do you think you are, lesbians?

283
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:15,390
像电影《越爱越美丽》(柏拉图式爱情)   我是说真的
It's like "the mirror has two faces". No, no, it is.

284
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,750
芭芭拉?史翠珊  演一个老处女教授
Because Barbra plays an unattractive professor,

285
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,660
不是要吐槽你
No offense,

286
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,760
剧中和  杰夫?布里奇斯结婚
Who marries Jeff Bridges

287
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,720
一开始他们都不热衷  享受性爱
Because neither one of them can handle sex.

288
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,830
当然芭芭拉是有慾望的
But of course Barbara gets horny because,

289
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,230
拜托  杰夫可是个天菜啊
Hello, Jeff's such a dreamboat.

290
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,400
所以  她站上踩步机
So, um, she hops on a stairmaster for like,

291
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,310
大概 2分钟吧
Two minutes,

292
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,260
吃了根胡萝卜棒
Eats a carrot stick and then,

293
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,210
然後证明她  其实可以很性感
Poof-- she gorgeous.

294
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,390
接着她走进房间
Then she comes in

295
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,430
穿得像《我要求审判》里的高级应召女
Dressed like the hooker in "nuts"

296
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,440
当然就引起了杰夫的性慾
And of course Jeff's willing to fuck her.

297
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,440
然後  他们...    就在街上跳舞
And, um, they... dance in the street.

298
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,670
结果她还是没被提名最佳女主角
And she still wasn't nominated.

299
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,950
我觉得  要嘛就来一炮  不嘛就没炮可打
You know, you do it right away, or you don't do it at all.

300
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,450
我替你高兴    小迈
I'm happy for you, Mikey.

301
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,880
他最好是
Fuck he is.

302
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,620
贾斯汀  达芙妮来了
Justin, daphne's here!

303
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,290
莫利
Molly

304
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,850
我们要迟到了
We're going to be late.

305
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,820
贾斯汀有跟我提过
Hey, look. Justin told me how great

306
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,000
说你对这一切都很能体谅
You're being about everthing.

307
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,720
我想告诉你  我觉得
And, uh, I just want to say I think

308
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,910
贾斯汀有你这麽善解人意的母亲  他很幸运
He's really lucky to have such an understanding mom.

309
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,610
嗯  我努力之中
Well, I'm trying.

310
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:12,110
这一定很难  因为  在我们家
Yeah, well it must be hard, 'cause in my family,

311
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,430
我是黑人   我父母也是
I'm black, my parents are black.

312
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,430
我们一家都是    你知道我的意思吧?
We're all black. You know what I mean?

313
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,450
大概了解
I think so.

314
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,900
对了   你有看到这传单吗?
Oh! Did you see the flyer?

315
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,690
什麽传单?
What flyer?

316
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,450
艺术展
For the art show.

317
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,970
他的名字可显眼了
His name's really big.

318
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,140
你快一点  好吗?
Would you come on already?

319
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,250
同志文化中心?   这是怎麽回事?
Gay And Lesbian Center? When did this happen?

320
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,250
喔哦   你是说他没跟你…...
Oh, my god, you mean he didn't...

321
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,650
这些日子他不太都跟我说话
He doesn't tell me much these days.

322
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,500
别说是我说的
Oh, promise you won't tell him

323
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,300
不然他以後也不会跟我讲了
I told you or he'll stop telling me.

324
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,000
你不用大声喊   你第一次喊我就听到了
You don't have to yell,  I heard you the first time.

325
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,980
我不知道什麽时候会回家
And I don't know when I'll be back.

326
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,790
贾斯汀
Justin!

327
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,790
注意安全
Be careful.

328
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,300
克丽丝  帮我拿那铁槌
Chris, pass me that hammer.

329
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,300
你真的很厉害     谢谢
You're really good at that.  Thanks.

330
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:56,930
我喜欢你们的手链
I like you guys' bracelets.

331
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,550
喔  这是象徵我们的友谊
Oh, they're for friendship. I mean,

332
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,030
他不是我男朋友
He's not my boyfriend.

333
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,630
-我知道　　-你怎麽知道我是弯的?
-I figured.  －You can tell I'm gay?

334
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:06,290
你人在这儿  不是吗?
Well you're here, aren't you?

335
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,140
我到楼下餐厅  喝点汽水
I'm heading on down to the diner

336
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,570
你要不要一起去?
To get a soda. Do you want to come?

337
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,460
好
Sure.

338
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,520
你要干嘛?    她以为你是拉拉
What are you doing?  She thinks you're a lesbian.

339
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,660
我就不能假装一下吗?
Well, can't I be one of the cool people too?

340
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,160
你真是怪人
You're a freak.

341
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,670
你真的很有才华    真的吗?
You know, you have real talent.  Really?

342
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,670
你应该好好进修   也许去读艺术学校
You should develop it. Maybe go to art school.

343
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,110
我一直在想这件事
I've been thinking about that.

344
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,580
如果你需要推荐书
Well, if you ever need a recommendation.

345
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,940
谢谢你
Thanks.

346
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
你觉得布莱恩会来吗?
Do you think Brian's going to come?

347
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,940
别对他抱太大希望   好吗?
Don't expect too much from him, okay?

348
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,240
怎样是太大的希望？
What's too much?

349
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,030
什麽希望都别抱
Anything at all.

350
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,130
你还是有很多恋爱的机会    贾斯汀
You'll have lots of relationships, Justin,

351
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,600
跟很多有趣的人
With lots of interesting people.

352
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,760
我知道你现在不这麽想   但以後你会了解
I know you don't believe that right now, but you will.

353
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,920
我只是想要他来看　他当主角的那幅画被展示出来
I just want him to see his picture framed, that's all.

354
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,460
你确定要进去吗?
Are you sure you want to do this?

355
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,980
为什麽不?    进去看看你的世界
Yeah, why not? I'll get a taste of your world,

356
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,990
看我是从哪里 把你救出来
See what I'm saving you from.

357
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:28,130
跟我记忆中一样
Just the same as I remember it.

358
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,210
这里的人也一样
Even the guys look the same.

359
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,510
为何你不来这了呢?
Why'd you stop?

360
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,200
不合适我  而且我遇到一个人
It wasn't for me. And I met someone.

361
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,000
我们在一起快6年了
Yeah, we were together almost six years.

362
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,180
哇  谁提分手的?
Wow. So, who left who?

363
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,590
他去世了
He died.

364
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,130
抱歉
I'm sorry.

365
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,260
没事
Nobody's fault.

366
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,000
你好
Hi!

367
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,470
这就是久闻大名的帅哥理疗师?
So, is, uh... is this the famous chiropractor?

368
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,200
大卫   这是艾美特
David, this is Emmett.

369
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,960
-你好  艾美特　-你好  帅哥
-Hi, Emmett.　-Hello, gorgeous.

370
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,540
嗯  我...
So, um, so I've, um...

371
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,410
我背上的肌肉有点紧绷
I've got a little tightness right in here.

372
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,630
偏偏是不该紧的地方   能帮我按一下吗?
One place I don't need it. Would you mind?

373
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,630
可以啊  不过你得先预约
I wouldn't mind at all if you made an appointment.

374
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,940
嗯~值得一试
Well, it's worth a shot.

375
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,740
泰德在哪?
Where's Ted?

376
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,910
和面团宝宝出去玩了 (松饼公司的吉祥物)
Out with the Pillsbury doughboy.

377
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,310
老天  你看那个男的
Oh, my god. That guy over there

378
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,920
真像马修?麦康利  (肌肉男星)
Looks exactly like Matthew Mcconaughey.

379
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:24,310
也许他习惯裸体抽大麻呢    失陪了
Maybe he smokes pot naked. Excuse me.

380
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,110
他真是基情四射 是吧
Doesn't hold anything back, huh?

381
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,960
他这已经算低调了
He was toning it down for you.

382
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,070
你跑哪去了?
Where the fuck have you been?

383
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,000
布莱恩  这是大卫
Brian, this is David.

384
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,140
喔  妈的　新男友耶
Oh, fuck me, the new boo.

385
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,540
久闻大名
I've heard a lot about you.

386
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,050
我也是
And I've heard a lot about you too.

387
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,690
右边16分钟  左边11分钟
Sixteen right, eleven left.

388
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,690
-什麽?　　　-没事
-Excuse me?　-Nothing.

389
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,530
你发神经了    磕了什麽药?
You're tweaked, what are you on?

390
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:58,460
摇头丸、拉K、神仙水　芝麻街最常教的那些字母
Oh, e, k, ghb. Most of the letters on "Sesame Street."

391
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,990
你嗑了这麽多   你会脱水的
You're gonna get dehydrated taking all that shit.

392
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,530
我去帮你拿水
I'm gonna get you some water.

393
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,650
-喝啤酒吗  -好
- Want a beer? - Sure.

394
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,350
你可把他训练得真好
Well, you've got him well-trained.

395
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:12,100
他照顾我  我照顾他
Well, he takes care of me, and I take care of him.

396
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,130
嘿  大夫
So, doc...

397
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,920
你和每个病人都上床吗?
Do you fuck all of your patients?

398
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,790
如果你是指迈克
Well, if you're referring to Michael,

399
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,680
我们在一起前
I released him from my care.

400
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,780
我们就已经医好他了
Before we went out together.

401
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,330
你呢?   从事哪方面工作?
What about you? What do you do?

402
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,180
搞广告的
Advertising.

403
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:36,140
嗯~那你一定知道  怎麽搞别人
Well, you must know a thing or two about screwing people yourself.

404
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,120
我做梦的时候都能搞
Yeah, I could do it in my sleep.

405
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,860
我也相信你可以
I bet you could.

406
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,690
大卫 你知道吗
You know, Dave,

407
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,950
你和小迈约会最奇怪的地方吗?
What's weird about you meeting Mikey?

408
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:46,920
小迈?
"Mikey"?

409
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,310
我们通常都一起出动钓男人
Is that we usually meet guys together.

410
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,730
他们通常都被你钓回家了
And they usually end up with you.

411
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:54,640
只有最幸运的人才会
The lucky ones.

412
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,760
幸运？我很怀疑
Debatable.

413
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,180
我错过了什麽?
So what'd I miss?

414
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,620
没什麽特别的
Nothing special.

415
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,110
好的
Okay,

416
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,050
猜猜这首我最爱的歌剧是出自哪出剧?
Identify my favorite aria of all time

417
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,640
猜中的话   你就被加入我的最爱
And you instantly become my new favorite person.

418
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,320
谢谢你给我这麽大压力
Oh, well, thanks for not putting any pressure on me.

419
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,860
莫札特:《狄多王的仁慈》薛斯托咏唱曲 第二幕
"Clemenzo Di Tito", Sesto's Aria, act two.

420
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,570
拜托　出难一点的题目吧
Come on, give me a tough one.

421
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:36,290
哇~别让我这麽快为你着迷
Okay, stop trying to make me fall for you.

422
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,150
-我有吗? 　　　 -你是我在匹兹堡遇到第一个
-Who's trying?  -You are the first person I've met in Pittsburgh

423
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,700
知道薛斯托咏唱曲的人
who knows Sesto's Aria.

424
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,140
我应该是唯一知道的
I'm the only other person who knows.

425
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:47,290
你知道吗   我小时候
You know, when I was a kid,

426
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:50,100
周六下午时常装病
I used to pretend I was sick on Saturday Afternoons

427
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,300
然後溜出去
so I could skip literally.

428
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,740
听收音机里的梅特歌剧节目
And listen to the Met opera broadcasts on the radio.

429
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:57,110
我希望那时就认识你    我们就可以一起听了
Huh, I wish I'd known you. We could have listened together.

430
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,170
这样不算越界吧?
Is, uh, is this allowed?

431
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,450
不算吧
Yeah.

432
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,420
只是
Only, uh...

433
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,840
我还没有完全准备好
I'm not quite... ready yet.

434
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,390
没关系
It's okay.

435
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,930
我很快会调整好
But I will be soon.

436
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,590
而且
And, uh...

437
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,450
我觉得这将会是个很棒体验
I have a feeling it's going to be great.

438
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,010
我想你刚应该不太好受
You had a hideous time, I can tell.

439
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,470
我不介意偶尔出来放松一下
Ah, I don't mind going out once in a while.

440
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,860
你是在暗示我是个无乐不作的女王?
Are you implying that I'm a scene queen?

441
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,330
你是啊
You are a scene queen.

442
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:51,010
我们在匹兹堡   没什麽乐可作
We're in Pittsburgh, there is no scene.

443
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,530
那这里有什麽吸引人的?
Yeah, so what's the big attraction?

444
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,920
如果你不出来   就交不到朋友
Well, if you don't go out, you don't meet People.

445
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,070
那我呢?
What about me?

446
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:58,280
极少数的例外  而且我的朋友都在这...
Rare exception. Besides, my friends are here...

447
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,250
你的朋友?　　真是好朋友啊
Your friends? Some friends.

448
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,120
你朋友布莱恩刚才想勾引我
Your friend Brian tried to hit on me.

449
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,520
他不会那样
He did not.

450
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,260
我也曾被人这麽勾引过
I've been around the block.

451
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,760
他总是一副想勾引人的样子
He's always like that.

452
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,060
而且  他嗑了药  有点high
Besides, he was high.

453
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,270
我只是想让你知道
I'm just telling you.

454
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,230
他不会这样做的
He wouldn't.

455
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,300
他已经这样做了
He did.

456
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,440
可恶
Shit.

457
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,570
他抢不你走   你是我的
Well, he can't have you. You're mine.

458
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,650
我告诉你   我不去
I told you, I'm not going.

459
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,370
我向他保证你会去的
I promised him you'd be there.

460
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:46,970
你不应该给他那种我做不到的保证
Well, you should stop making promises that I can't keep.

461
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:50,720
别这麽机车   我在帮你擦屁股
Hey, don't be a shit. I'm trying to clean up some of your mess.

462
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:53,370
嘿  是他自己投怀送抱
Look, he's the one that threw himself at me.

463
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,130
我甩都甩不掉
I've been trying to get rid of him.

464
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,940
你可以去跟法官说
Tell it to the judge.

465
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,220
你何时说话变得像你家那位?
When did you start sounding like your girlfriend?

466
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,360
是时候你该为社群贡献一点
It's time you became part of the community.

467
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,320
听着  别因为我干男人
Look, just because I fuck guys

468
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:08,200
我就应该属於什麽社群
Does not mean I'm part of some community.

469
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,170
也不代表我和社群的人
And it doesn't mean I have anything in common

470
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:11,800
有任何共通之处
with someone else who does.

471
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,230
其实不只你认为的那样
You know, it's more than that.

472
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:15,030
我们必须互相照顾
we need to take care of each other.

473
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,030
我不想照顾别人
I don't need to take care of anyone,

474
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,490
我也不需要别人来照顾我
And I don't need anyone to take care of me.

475
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:20,840
有一天你会需要的
One day you might.

476
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,720
干他的团体
Fuck groups.

477
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,130
我以为你干过(团体)了
I thought you did.

478
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:30,130
偶尔会干　还非得有邀请函才能加入
Occasionally, but it's by invitation only.

479
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,550
你看到了吗?   你的画每幅标价美金一百元
Did you see this? they're charging $100

480
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,510
每一幅都是
For every one of your drawings.

481
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,690
你要发财了
You could be rich.

482
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,950
这是慈善活动   收入不是给我的
It's charity. I don't get to keep it.

483
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,480
还是很值得说嘴
Still.

484
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,440
你可以不要一直朝着大门看吗?
And would you stop watching the door?

485
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,810
他琴弹得很好  对吧
He plays beautifully, doesn't he?

486
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,830
我不太懂音乐
I'm all a-tingle.

487
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:17,130
所以你们两个干过了没?
So have you two had sex yet?

488
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,180
没有
No.

489
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,980
你小声点可以吗?
Would you keep your voice down?

490
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,570
那你们何时小声过了？
Well, when are you?

491
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,470
当我们两个都觉得应该做的时候
When we both know it's the right thing to do.

492
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:28,390
上床从来就不是应该做的事情
Sex is never the right thing to do.

493
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,600
救济穷人才是应该做的事情
Feeding the poor is the right thing to do.

494
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,500
聘雇残障人士才是应该做的事情
Hiring the handicapped is the right thing to do.

495
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,390
捐血才是应该做的事
Donating blood.

496
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:35,050
好吧   我了解你的意思
All right, all right, you made your point.

497
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:37,290
所有人都喜欢你的画
Everyone loves your drawings.

498
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:38,970
-你们要不要去吃些东西　　    -我不饿
-You guys check out the food?   -I'm not hungry.

499
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,050
好吧  那些帅哥怎麽样?
Okay. How about the cute guys?

500
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:42,570
那边也有一些和你年纪差不多的小帅哥
There's some right over there. Just about your age.

501
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,150
他来了
He's here.

502
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,490
开心哦
Mmm! yippee.

503
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,930
你不想去找他吗?
Well, aren't you going to go over there?

504
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,280
你疯了吗?
Are you crazy?

505
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,030
谢谢你过来
Thanks for coming.

506
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:03,500
随便啦
Whatever.

507
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,860
这里有暗室吗?
Where's the back room?

508
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,780
琳赛   这是大卫
Lindsay, this is david.

509
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,620
-你好　　　　　　　-你好
-Nice to meet you.　-Nice to meet you.

510
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,840
嘿  迈克
Whoo! Michael.

511
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,630
我们先去看看阴道的雕刻吧　早看完早了事
Let's go check out the vagina sculptures first, get it over with.

512
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,880
有名的小画家啊
The famous "art-eest."

513
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,540
你看过我的画了吗?
Did you see my stuff?

514
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,190
不  我得先喝一杯
no, I had to get a drink first.

515
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:38,770
你感兴趣的话   可以到那里看看
It's over there, in case you're interested.

516
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,220
喂
Psst.

517
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,950
我觉得这位艺术家有点失真了
I think the artist has taken some liberties.

518
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,840
哦~画得非常拟真啊
Oh, that's a perfect likeness.

519
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:09,080
拜托…你的屌才没那麽大
Come on, it was never that big.

520
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,340
嘿～你可是很久没看过我的大屌了
Hey, you haven't seen it in a long time.

521
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,960
我也很久没看《乱世佳人》(电影)
I haven't seen "gone with the wind" in a long time either,

522
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,180
但我仍然知道它片长三个半小时
But i know it's still three and a half hours.

523
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,680
看看   布莱恩和迈克脱口秀
The brian and michael show.

524
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,490
blah~blah  没完没了的
Blah, blah, blah. stuck in perpetual reruns.

525
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,460
他们总是这样吗?  迈克跟在布莱恩後面追?
Is it always like that? Michael running after him?

526
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,570
相信我   这是史上最棒的爱情故事
It's the greatest love story never told, trust me.

527
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,230
-阁下大名? 　　　    -大卫
-Oh, what is your name?    -David.

528
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,020
-茉蕾妮      -相信我   大卫
-Melanie. 　-Trust me,  David,

529
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,270
就算你不在了　　迈克还是会跟在他後面
Long after you're gone, he'll still have Michael.

530
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,270
布莱恩可怜的小跟班
Brian's little acolyte, poor guy.

531
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:42,150
哦～不过别担心    就算迈克等一辈子
Oh, but don't worry. Michael can't wait forever.

532
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,440
布莱恩也不会干他的　　抱歉我讲粗话
Brian'll never fuck him. Pardon my french.

533
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,900
对了　听说你昨晚勾引大卫
By the way, I heard you hit on david last night.

534
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,200
我没那麽疯吧
I couldn't have been that high.

535
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,590
你有   你真的做了
You were. and you did.

536
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:53,660
我是在测试他
I was testing him.

537
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,900
我想看看　　他有机会的话　　会不会甩了你
I wanted to see if he'd drop you the first chance he got.

538
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,450
最好是
Oh, yeah right.

539
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,620
我不是都在照顾你吗?
Aren't I always looking out for you?

540
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,370
你只是在嫉妒终於有人
You're just jealous because somebody finally

541
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:05,120
认为我很性感或什麽的
thinks I'm hot or something.

542
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:09,230
你很性感或什麽的
You are hot or something.

543
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,540
你从14岁开始  我就一直跟你这样说了
I've been telling you that since you were 14.

544
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,200
但你偏不相信
But you won't believe me.

545
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,780
所以~　我只是迈克的备胎
So, I suppose I just keep him company while Michael waits.

546
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,050
该死
Oh! oh, shit!

547
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,910
哦~　原来你和迈克一起的
Oh, you're with Michael.

548
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:29,150
-对　　-天啊
-Yeah.  -Um, oh, jesus,

549
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,510
对不起   我刚不是那个意思
I-I'm sorry. I-I didn't mean that.

550
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,930
我是说   布莱恩总是喜欢
I-I mean-- well, I-I mean Brian's the one

551
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:35,430
跟新朋友炫耀自己情史
That's always showing up with some new guy,

552
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,820
所以我只是以为....
so I just assumed it that...um.

553
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,350
没关系
Don't worry about it.

554
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,460
事实上  他们~　他们~只是像好朋友一样爱着对方
Well, you know, they, they're-- they love each other as friends,

555
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,900
仅此而已   真的  只是这样
But that's it. That's really-- that's all it is.

556
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,420
是吗？ 我看起来不像
Really, it's not like I didn't know.

557
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,550
要不要吃个虾球?
Do you want a shrimp ball?

558
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,050
不了
No.

559
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,130
谢谢
Thanks.

560
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:12,090
这就是我所谓的一件..
Now that's what I call a piece.

561
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,250
艺术品　(piece後常接ass)
Of art.

562
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,200
我一直很欣赏有创造力的人
I've always admired creative people.

563
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:21,450
你是很有创造力的人  小妞
You're pretty creative yourself there, missy.

564
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,320
我不是
Not me.

565
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:27,780
但是迈克   他有天赋
But Michael, he's got a gift.

566
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,210
我不晓得他会画画
I didn't know he could draw.

567
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,800
他不会画画
Oh, he can't.

568
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,080
他小时候我帮他买过描图纸
I bought him tracing paper when he was a kid

569
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,050
这样他可以临摹漫画人物
so he could copy his comic books.

570
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,970
但他画的蜘蛛人总是
His spiderman always ended up with

571
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,620
更像孤儿安妮
Looking more like little orphan annie.

572
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,320
那他有什麽天赋?
Well, what's his talent?

573
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,400
他没有可以出名的技艺
Well, it's nothing he'd be famous for.

574
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,610
你不可能看到...
You won't ever see his...

575
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:49,560
他的画挂在画廊或者...
Paintings hanging in an art gallery or...

576
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,630
听到他在卡内基音乐厅演奏　(纽约着名的音乐厅)
Hear him playing at carnegie hall.

577
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:56,150
但是说到照顾别人
But when it comes to taking care of people

578
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,760
他比任何人更了解你的需求
Knowing what you need better even than you do

579
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,530
他也简直是个毕卡索
He's a fuckin' picasso.

580
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,440
光与影完美的交融
Beautiful light and shadow.

581
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,480
非常过目难忘
Very... haunting.

582
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,800
摄影者的视角……满独特的
The photographer has a great eye.

583
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,250
强烈的...  元素结合
Strong... composition.

584
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,450
你不能待在这里  你快回去吧
You can't stay, you have to leave.

585
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:52,100
贾斯汀   别太机车
Now, Justin, don't be mean.

586
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,620
我会遵守承诺的
I've kept my end of the bargain.

587
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,660
现在我只想看看我儿子的作品
Now-now I would like to see my son's work.

588
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,940
我不会让你感到尴尬的   我保证
 I won't embarrasse you. I promise.

589
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,660
贾斯汀  这位是你母亲吗
Justin, is this your mother?

590
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,360
你好  我是詹妮弗
Hi, I'm Jennifer.

591
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,290
茉蕾妮    琳赛
Melanie.  Lindsay.

592
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,110
你的儿子真有才华
You know, your son's remarkably talented.

593
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,830
你应该为他感到骄傲
you should be very proud.

594
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,040
谢谢你  我的确为他感到骄傲
Well, thank you. I am.

595
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,410
好漂亮的孩子
And what a beautiful baby.

596
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:17,760
他叫盖斯    贾斯汀帮忙取的名字
His name's Gus. actually, Justin's the one who named him.

597
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,850
真的吗   那是他泰迪熊的名字
Really? well, that was his teddy bear's name.

598
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,730
哦~泰迪熊
Aw! oh, a teddy bear.

599
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,660
妈
Mom!

600
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,130
你是他妈妈吗?
Um, are you the mother?

601
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,040
对  但我们一起抚养他
Uh, yes, but we're raising him together.

602
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,570
这很好啊
Well, that's wonderful.

603
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,830
我以前从来没见过拉拉双亲
I've never met lesbian mothers before.

604
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:37,000
我是说  我看过你们...  他们
I mean, I-I read about you... them,

605
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,780
常在报纸上看到的
In the papers all the time.

606
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,090
总是有些阿拉巴马的法官
Yeah, seems like there's always some judge in Alabama

607
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,170
想夺走我们的孩子
trying to take our kid away.

608
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,710
所以我才要嫁给一个律师
That's why I married a lawyer.

609
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,710
你看过画了吗?
Have you seen the art?

610
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:51,870
还没
Not yet.

611
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:53,640
亲爱的    你的作品在哪里?
where's your stuff, honey?

612
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,280
她来支持你了　这才是最重要的
She came. That's huge.

613
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,230
巨大的能量
Tremendous energy.

614
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:09,630
真的朝你射出...
It really comes right out at you.

615
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:16,290
罗杰  我觉得我准备好了...
Roger... I think I'm ready.

616
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,980
我答应过要弹钢琴的
I promised to play the piano.

617
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:23,710
-你只是义工　　　　　-说的对   管他的
-You're just volunteering.   -you're right. fuck 'em!

618
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,480
你画的那个人是谁?
Who's that guy you drew?

619
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,660
对不起    没关系
Oh, sorry!  that's all right.

620
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:44,580
噢  对不起

621
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,500

It's okay.

622
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,240
-我很抱歉　　　　　　-怎麽了?

-No, I-I can't.　　-What is it?

624
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:02,140
-有问题吗?　　　　　　　-这样没办法
-Is something wrong?　-It just won't work.

625
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,790
我以为我可以的  真的
I thought I could do this. I really did.

626
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:10,180
我知道  你人很好  聪明又有才华
I mean, you are so nice and smart and talented.

627
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,500
钢琴弹得很好
And you play the piano beautifully.

628
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,150
-但是..  　-但是..
-But? 　-well..

629
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,320
继续   说出来吧
Go on, say it.

630
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,630
你不是我喜欢的类型
You're just not my type.

631
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,090
喜欢的类型?
Type?

632
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:26,950
你搞我吗?
Are you serious?

633
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:30,330
天啊   我不敢相信  在我们交心後?
God! I don't believe this. after all that?

634
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:33,500
我以为你不是只想要"性"的关系
I thought you didn't want sex to be everything.

635
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,770
是呀  可是...
Yeah, but...

636
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,970
我还是希望"性"是其中一部份...
I'd like it to be something.

637
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:43,990
你跟其他人都一样
You're just like all the others.

638
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,930
我袜子呢?
Where's my sock?

639
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:54,780
是我不对   对不起
Look, it's my fault, i admit it.

640
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,770
干   我不知道自己哪里不对劲
I mean, I-I don't know what the hell's wrong with me.

641
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:58,800
我是说  你很迷人
I mean, you're a catch.

642
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,270
任何一个异性恋女人  都会觉得你很有吸引力
Any straight woman would find you incredibly attractive.

643
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:05,740
你说这些是为了让我好过一点吗?    去你的
Oh, is that supposed to make me feel better? fuck you.

644
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,980
我知道我们在很多事情上都有共同点
Look, I know we share all the important things

645
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,890
音乐　幽默感
Music, a sense of humor.

646
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,410
这对我来说都觉得很合适
This would be a totally appropriate relationship for me.

647
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:17,550
唯一的问题就是 "性"方面不合适
The only problem is, is that sex isn't appropriate.

648
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,030
是我错了
You know, I was wrong.

649
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,870
你不是跟别人一样   你是比他们更糟
You're not like all the others, you're worse.

650
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:26,080
因为你以为知道
Because you think knowing sesto's aria

651
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,180
《狄多王的仁慈》薛斯托咏唱曲
from "clemenzo di tito"

652
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,360
就能让你高人一等
Somehow makes you better.

653
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:29,810
让我告诉你一件事
Well, let me tell you,

654
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,410
你不过是个傲娇屁精
You're nothing but a pretentious,

655
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,790
以自我为中心　无聊透顶的大屁精
self-involved, 　boring asshole.

656
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,840
成天跟底迪们鬼混
Who's still hanging around with younger guys

657
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,330
还指望他们跟你性交
Who don't want you and never will.

658
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,000
你太可悲了
You're pathetic!

659
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:43,780
那你呢?
And what about you?

660
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:47,860
在你指挥完第501场桑德海姆音乐会
You know, after you conduct your 501st tribute to Sondheim,

661
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,760
你就应该去躺健身房
You might try going to a gym.

662
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,920
至少去看看跑步机长什麽样子
You know, get on a treadmill for once in your life.

663
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,080
还有  冲一冲你的嘴
And do something about your breath!

664
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,330
我想说的是
Listen.

665
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,760
我想我们连朋友都做不了
I don't suppose we could still be friends.

666
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,990
所以我想　"好吧　至少他正在经历一些事"
So I thought, "okay, he's having... experiences."

667
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,300
但是好歹也该和同年龄的人吧
But with boys his own age.

668
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,800
这个　男人  肯定有30多了吧
This... man, he must be in his thirties.

669
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:39,500
啊  还不到
Well not yet,

670
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,680
但是我很高兴让他知道你这麽觉得
But I'll be happy to tell him you thought so.

671
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,390
一切都是不对劲
Well it's not right.

672
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,300
但它发生了
It happens.

673
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,200
如果他爸爸发现了
If his father finds out--

674
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:53,140
跟我说说这个男人　这位...老兄
Tell me about him, this... person.

675
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,520
我得多知道一些
I have to know.

676
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:55,970
布莱恩?肯尼
Brian Kinney.

677
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,950
上帝赐予同志圈的大礼
God's gift to gay p.a.

678
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,110
每个人都想要布莱恩
They all want Brian.

679
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,000
好消息是　　没人可以拥有他
But the good news is, no one can have him.

680
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:08,780
他搞过他们　伤了他们的心
He screws them,  breaks their heart

681
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,020
然後他们就长大成熟了
and they wise up.

682
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,020
大部份人都这样
Well, most of them anyway.

683
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,820
所以说  这个  呃...
So, this, uh...

684
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,360
布莱恩?肯尼
Brian Kinney...

685
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,120
他会伤我儿子的心
He's going to hurt my son.

686
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,060
-我该怎麽做?　　-什麽也不能做
-What do I do?   -Nothing.

687
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:30,490
你帮不上忙   除非你想火上加油
There's nothing you can do without making it worse.

688
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:32,300
他才17岁啊
He's only 17.

689
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,000
你第一次是几岁?
How old were you the first time?

690
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:40,000
-16　　　　　-我15
-Sixteen.　　-Fifteen.

691
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,590
总之   如果能让你觉得好一点
Anyway, if it makes you feel any better,

692
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,710
我认识布莱恩的时候他才14岁
I've known Brian since he was 14.

693
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,210
他没什麽大变化
He hasn't changed much.

694
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,960
我觉得   他和贾斯汀 还挺相配的
In fact, I'd say he and Justin are pretty evenly matched.

695
00:38:57,370 --> 00:39:00,050
我不知道是否真的可以这麽包容
I don't know if I can be so accepting.

696
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:00,900
亲爱的
Honey.

697
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:02,780
詹妮弗
Jennifer.

698
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,860
你也没什麽选择
You don't have too much choice.

699
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,580
你能做的就是   希望他们能小心而安全
All you can do is hope that they'll be careful,

700
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:11,600
而且还记得你的电话号码
And that they remember your phone number.

701
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,730
-来　　　　-你敢
-Here.　-Don't you dare.

702
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:21,730
我请客
This is on me.

703
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,300
谢啦
Thanks.

704
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,190
噢   这个
Oh, here.

705
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,020
给他需要的
Give him what he needs.

706
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,920
承认吧   你怀念这一切
Admit it! You missed all this.

707
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,450
怀念你们这些   自恋狂
The rampant narcissism,

708
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,690
卑鄙小人和毒虫?
The sleaze, the drug use?

709
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,370
我才不想念这些
I don't think so.

710
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,440
那你为什麽回来?
So why'd you come back?

711
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,230
等我搞清楚    我再告诉你
When I figure it out, I'll let you know.

712
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,280
哇  你们看
Oh, look,

713
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,180
《超人集中营》的演员来了　(都是童星演出的影集)
It's the cast of "ZOOM".

714
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,610
我们来这庆祝
We're celebrating.

715
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,420
贾斯汀今天卖了一些他的画作
Justin sold some of his art today.

716
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,270
包括你那一张    正面全裸的
The one of you, naked.

717
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,930
谁会买那幅画?
Who'd buy that?

718
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:16,190
可能是某个一直想被你拖去行房的娘娘
Probably some desperate queen who's always pined for you.

719
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:19,150
泰德　　你真是体贴啊
Oh, Ted. how thoughtful.

720
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,010
啊  天啊   我好喜欢这首歌
Oh, my god, I used to love this song!

721
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,780
来跳舞吧
Then, let's dance.

722
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:35,860
我要去尿尿
I gotta pee.

723
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,750
来吧  大卫太医
Okay, Dr. feel good.

724
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,200
让我看看你的舞姿   来嘛
Let me see you shake your groove thang. Come on.

725
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:01,230
看看~他会跳舞耶　果然是同志无误
Ooh, he can dance. he is gay, after all.

726
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,550
有人说过你是最不良示范吗？
Anybody ever tell you you're a bad influence?

727
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:15,920
你...
you are

728
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:59,060
噢  你好吗?
Hi. how you doing?

729
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,100
多好了　所以不谢过了
Better. no thanks to you.

730
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,480
我一直不清楚那天晚上到底发生什麽事
I never really knew for sure what happened that night.

731
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,450
我想你应该已经恢复了
So, uh, I figured you came out of it Okay.

732
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:09,020
我很怕从报纸看到你的讣闻
I kept looking the papers.

733
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,560
是喔   那还真是...　贴心
Gee, that's... really thoughtful.

734
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,010
我  呃...
I, uh...

735
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:17,290
那天我叫了救护车之後
Waited on the corner...

736
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:20,300
在转角一直等...  确定他们真的上去了
After I called the paramedics, to make sure they came.

737
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:23,860
是你叫的救护车
You mean you called 9-1-1?

738
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,890
我不想留在旁边
I didn't want to stick around.

739
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,950
我很害怕   怕被发现毒品 然後进了警局
I was afraid, you know, the drugs and shit.

740
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,510
是喔
Right.

741
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,830
你喝了那麽大一口   我心想...  糟糕.)
I mean, you took so much, I was like, "whoa".

742
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:38,710
不管怎样    我很高兴你没事
Anyway... I'm glad you're okay.

743
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:42,630
那麽...
Well, uh...

744
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,920
或许我们可以  找时间再聚一聚
Maybe we could, uh, get together again some time.

745
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,730
这次不叫救护车
Without the paramedics.

746
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:53,190
你在这     怎麽那麽久?
There you are. What's taking you so long?

747
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:55,450
在跟别人讲话啦
Just talking to some guy.

748
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:57,940
你叫什麽名字?
What's your name again?

749
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,450
-泰德    -泰德  就是泰德
-Ted.    -Ted, right.

750
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:06,550
嗯   再见了
Yeah, I'll... see you later.

751
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,320
再见
See ya.

752
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,110
嗨   你好
Hey, how's it going?

753
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:23,740
嘿    你好吗?
Yo!   Hi, how are you?

754

756
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:34,180
你的项链不错看喔
It's a great little collar that you got.

757
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:38,650
嗨    你好

758
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:41,880
你们两个真的在一起    真了不起
You two are together, that's something.

759
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:48,310
噢  天哪  你在厕所跟某个小男生做了吧
Oh, my god, you did it in the little boys' room.

760
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:49,310
没有
Nope.

761
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:51,620
你要了谁的电话吗?
You got somebody's phone number?

762
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:54,360
每个人都拒绝我...
I was rejected by everybody.

763
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,130
回来的感觉真好
It's good to be back!

764
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,380
-来杯鸡尾酒吧　　　　-好啊
-Let's get you a cocktail.　-Okay.

765
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:37,940
嗨～　猛男   想跳舞吗?
Hey, hot stuff, you want to dance?

766
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:39,650
不太想
I don't think so.

767
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,860
那你想干嘛?
Well, what do you want to do?

768
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:43,950
带你回家
Take you home.

769
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,560
我是阿斯特罗队长
Captain Astro.

770
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,710
你在想谁?
Who are you thinking about?

771
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:50,140
什麽?
What?

772
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:55,350
你闭上眼睛的时候　你在想谁?
When you close your eyes, who are you thinking about?

773
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,500
