1
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,880
How are we doing?

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,280
Uh, yeah.

3
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,120
- All okay?
- Mm-hmm.

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,120
- Am I in the right ballpark?
- Yeah. Uh, just come a bit...

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,240
Is that?

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,320
Yeah.

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,240
- How about that?
- Mm-hmm.

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,040
- And now?
- Yeah. A... a little to the left.

9
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,000
- But <i>my</i> left or stage left?
- My left.

10
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,520
So, stage right.

11
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,480
Fuck!

12
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,560
Fuck.

13
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,400
You missed breakfast.

14
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,000
Mrs. Thomas wanted you to have these.

15
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,400
And... this.

16
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,200
<i>♪ Outside there's a box car waiting... ♪</i>

17
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,440
What is it?

18
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,080
Some kind of... curd.

19
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,800
Okay, guys. In we go.

20
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,840
- Morning.
- Morning.

21
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,120
Good morning.

22
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,720
Okay, are we in?

23
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,160
To be continued.

24
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,000
- Okay. Morning, folk.
- Morning.

25
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,320

29
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,056
- Okay. Come on. Let's do this.
- All right.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,280
Where are we today, Em?

31
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,240
Uh, Heartwood Community Primary
at Wolverhampton.

32
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,760
Last show of the tour, comrades.
Let's make it a good 'un.

33
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,440
Or at least, no worse
than the low bar we set yesterday.

34
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,040
What's that stink?

35
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,840
Your attitude.

36
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,480
That's the remains of the clutch.

37
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,080
No, it's not.
It's bloody petrol. I'm ringing Equity.

38
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,960
Bye, Mrs. T!

39
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,680
Thanks for the bedbugs.

00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,320
Sorry.

"Where were we?"

47
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,440
"Shaf-tes-bury Avenue."

48
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,560
Two syllables.

49
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,040
"Shaftes-bury."

50
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,800
Why not "Shaf-tes-bury"?

51
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,520
No idea.

52
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,360
But you are meant to be my teacher.

53
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,760
You are meant to know.

54
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,360
Sorry.

55
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,040
Hmm. Let's put this aside.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,360
And revise again
what we were just revising.

57
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,240
<i>Dear Dex.
Or should I say, "Ciao, bella"?</i>

58
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,280
<i>Are you in Rome yet?</i>

59
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,280
<i>Your pretend teaching job must start soon,</i>

60
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,560
<i>and I think you said
your parents were coming to visit.</i>

61
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,440
<i>If so, please send them my regards.</i>

62
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,480
<i>I'm sure they remember me fondly
as the girl who came to stay,</i>

63
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,520
<i>drank all their wine, and lectured them
about the founding of the welfare state.</i>

64
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,360
<i>Oh God.</i>

65
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,560
<i>I write from the dazzlingly
picturesque A4123 to Wolverhampton.</i>

66
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,920
<i>It's the last show of the tour today.</i>

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
<i>The Royal Shakespeare Company we are not,
but it's fun and important, maybe.</i>

68
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,040
We've been round here.

69
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,400
If I have to see that cunting Pizza Hut
one more time!

70
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,240
Then close your eyes,
you miserable bastard.

71
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,200
How dare you speak
to me like that?

72
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,480
<i>There's been a lovely camaraderie
in the company.</i>

73
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,880
I'll report you to Equity.

74
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,560
<i>But acting's not for me.</i>

75
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,600
<i>The only emotion I can convey convincingly
is embarrassment,</i>

76
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,320
<i>and I still don't know
what to do with my hands.</i>

77
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,640
No time in the dressing room.
We'll be straight in and then straight on.

78
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,400
<i>So while you're poncing around
eating gelato,</i>

79
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,680
<i>I'm sat here pondering, "What next?"</i>

80
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,840
<i>What am I doing with my life?
Where do I go from here?</i>

81
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,600
<i>Who is he, then?</i>

82
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,640
Who's who?

83
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,200
"Dear Dex."

84
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,640
Oh. Uh, he's a friend from university.

85
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,920
What <i>friend</i>
sends that many postcards?

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
One who's too idle
to write a letter.

87
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,840
Dexter Mayhew, I take it.
Is that who you're talking about?

88
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,160
Yeah, I cast him once
at a play in Edinburgh.

89
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,720
Was he any good?

90
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,880
Diabolical accent. Couldn't sing.

91
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,400
Made no effort to learn his lines.

92
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,560
So I would say no.

93
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,480
Just twatted about
in the costume, smoking.

94
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,080
Yeah. Yeah, that does sound like Dexter.

95
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,920
He's a profoundly unserious person.

96
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,320
Yeah.

97
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,800
<i>Oh. And Gary sends his love.</i>

98
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,520
- I think you should do it this afternoon.
- Mom?

99
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,440
Dexter, where have you been?

100
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,520
Oh, you know.

101
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,800
Just over there,
watching you chat up young men.

102
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,240
Oh, how dare you?

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,640
You're such a flirt.

104
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,480
Where do you think you got it from?
It wasn't Dad.

105
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,560
Look at you. You're all tanned.

106
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,760
- Are you drunk already?
- No, I'm just pleased to see you.

107
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,840
Where were you last night?
We waited at the restaurant for ages.

108
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,000
The college disco.

109
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,840
What? They're all over 18.

110
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,520
Well, we missed you.

111
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,320
Here.

112
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,800
Can't finish this by myself.

113
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,200
Thank you.

114
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,520
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

115
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,480
You look well.

116
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,400
So do you.

117
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,800
I know you think they make you look
like a film star, but they don't.

118
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,800
It looks awful.

119
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,640
Well, why do you do it, then?

120
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,280
'Cause it makes me look sensational.

121
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,520
Okay. This is it, guys.
The last day of the tour.

122
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,040
- What's happened to my trousers?
- Can't get nervous.

123
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,600
Has someone been meddling
with my fucking trousers?

124
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,296
- Stay present. Candy, great warm-up.
- Five minutes, guys.

125
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,720
Kwame, a looseness
on the keys as well, please.

126
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,400
And keep it lively. Keep it fresh.

127
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,920
Mind! Jesus!

128
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,360
There's no lock.

129
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,240
Ah, the glamor
and the smell of the greasepaint.

130
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,480
I can smell that,
and it's not greasepaint.

131
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,560
Drink some water.

132
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,280
- Fuck off.
- Uh, can we stay focused? Um...

133
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,080
Say the lines like you're saying them
for the first time.

134
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,360
- I'm a bit emotional.
- Save it. Save that for the scenes.

135
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,720
Uh, and remember.

136
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,960
Don't just act. <i>React.</i>

137
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,920
Your focus is always on that other actor
because they are real,

138
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,120
and they only exist in...

139
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,040
Another opening, another show.

140
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,000
Down the hall,
first left after the Bayeux Tapestry.

141
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,880
Come on. Come on. Come on. Let's go.

142
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,160
- Today.
- Oh God.

143
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,800
And trust your instincts.

144
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,240
So, tell me.

145
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,000
Have you met anyone on your grand tour?

146
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,520
I've met lots of people.

147
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,720
Who?

148
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,280
Tell me while your father's not here.

149
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,640
You know I'm forced
to live vicariously through my children,

150
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,440
and your sister is such a virgin.

151
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,400
You <i>are</i> drunk.

152
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,320
How she got two children, I'll never know.

153
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,120
Who's been sending you all those long,
tearstained letters we keep forwarding?

154
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,440
Tearstained?

155
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,960
Just tell me.

156
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,920
There's nothing to tell.

157
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,840
Really?

158
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,840
Really.

159
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,240
What about that girl
who came and stayed for Christmas?

160
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,520
She was pretty.

161
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,600
A bit shy. And she got drunk and started
shouting about the miner's strike.

162
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,000
That was Emma Morley.

163
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,920
Emma Morley.

164
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,920
I liked her.

165
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,320
Even if she did call your father
a bourgeois fascist.

166
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,120
I didn't mind.

167
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,640
At least she had a bit of fire,
a bit of passion.

168
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,040
Not like the silly sexpots
we usually find at the breakfast table.

169
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,840
- Mom!
- Well, it's true.

170
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,720
What about this Emma?

171
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,760
She's just a friend.

172
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,640
Really?

173
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Yes.

174
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,240
- I thought she was funny.
- Mm.

175
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,760
And that she liked you.

176
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,200
- Liked me?
- Mm-hmm.

177
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,400
Everyone likes me.

178
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,840
Don't stop being nice, will you?

179
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,080
What?

180
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,840
We've got this afternoon together,
don't we?

181
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,280
Yeah. And the evening too, if you want.

182
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,080
Good.

183
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,000
Please give a warm
Heartwood Community Primary welcome

184
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,200
to Sledgehammer.

{\an8}Once upon a time, not so very long ago,
only men were allowed to vote.

190
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,440
{\an8}Women had argued for years
for this basic right, but nothing changed.

191
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,560
Until, one day...

192
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,680
along came a woman
called Emmeline Pankhurst, who decided...

193
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,360
Enough is enough!

194
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,040
Too big. Too big.

Hammer!

200
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,760
Uh, to Candy for her phenomenal mask work.

201
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,680
To Kwame, voice of an angel.
Sid, of course, for keeping us grounded.

202
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,720
- Oh, fuck off.
- And obviously, Emma.

203
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,040
For everything.

204
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,080
Aw.

205
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,240
Uh, to groundbreaking,
radical theater.

206
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:29,400
To many more productions,
and to changing young lives through art.

207
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,440
To the kid who wet himself
during my soliloquy and blamed his flask.

208
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,560
To the boys in Solihull
who chucked Minstrels at me.

209
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,040
And to the prefect at Marston Hill
who felt me up.

210
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,360
Ugh.

211
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,560
- Where have you been?
- Post office. Right, something for you.

212
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,440
Something for you.

213
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,760
So he's moved on to packages now,
has he?

214
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,440
No, it's from my mom.

215
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,000
Oh, and there was a message
from your agent.

216
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,440
- Was there?
- No.

217
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,840
Brutal.

218
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,280
Too far, Tracey.

219
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,080
So, what next?

220
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,040
Espresso.

221
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,240
You can't have a cappuccino
after breakfast. No one in Italy does.

222
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,360
I mean, what next for you, Dexter?
What's your plan?

223
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,400
Plan?

224
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,640
Yes. You said you're nearly finished here.
So what now?

225
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,160
Don't know.

226
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,440
Barcelona?

227
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,840
I don't mean what city, Dexter.

228
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,240
I mean, what are you going to do
with your life?

229
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,760
Why are you in such a rush
for me to figure out what I'm doing?

230
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,880
I'm just asking because I love you.

231
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,680
Mm.

232
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,840
Maybe, um,

233
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,240
journalism.

234
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,360
Journalism?

235
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,920
But you don't write, do you?

236
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,560
Well, I was thinking
maybe photojournalism.

237
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,680
Actually, I was thinking
about photography.

238
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,000
Photography?

239
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,560
- Yeah.
- What kind of photography? Glamor?

240
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,720
Or will you be
continuing your work on texture?

241
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,880
Do you remember your O-level art project?

242
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,200
- I remember.
- All those photographs of gravel.

243
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,840
Oh my God. You used to stand
in the driveway for hours, snapping away.

244
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,520
Sorry, Dexter. That was mean.

245
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,600
I'm a mean woman.

246
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,720
It's just a thought.

247
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,840
- Looks and charm go a long way, Dexter.
- Mom.

248
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,800
And you've got both in abundance.

249
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:47,120
But I'm worried
that you lack drive, purpose.

250
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,480
Purpose is so key to happiness, darling.

251
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,760
I'm not enjoying
this conversation.

252
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,680
What I'm trying to say
is that you've had luck.

253
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,720
So much luck.

254
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,880
And you've been protected from things.

255
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,840
Responsibilities and money.

256
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,680
But you're an adult now.

257
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,840
And

258
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,040
one day...

259
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,000
things might not be this...

260
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,200
serene.

261
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,440
No. It'll just be stamps and socks
and some job ads.

262
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,200
Jobs? Where?

263
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,440
- What, Leeds?
- Yeah.

264
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,480
Are you going back, then?

265
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,800
Yeah, I suppose I am.

266
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,600
I mean, I did toy with Paris,

267
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,656
but then I thought it might be tricky
to sign on from the bank of the Seine.

268
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,360
What auditions are you gonna get in Leeds?

269
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,880
I don't want to audition.

270
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,680
I... I wanna write.

271
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,240
Plays, books.

272
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,800
- Ah.
- Hark at her.

273
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,720
Sounds so grand, doesn't it?
"I want to write."

274
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,120
- What you gonna write?
- Our next play.

275
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,160
Probably about a woman who goes back home
with her fancy college ways

276
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,040
and is never heard from again.

277
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,480
- What would you like?
- Uh...

278
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,800
Can I have a word?

279
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,120
Yeah. Sorry.

280
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,920
It's been really amazing, Emma.

281
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
It's been fun.

282
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,360
So let's keep going.
Don't go back to Leeds.

283
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,880
Let's stay on the van, do another play.

284
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,680
You know the apartheid project
that I wrote to the Arts Council about?

285
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,040
They want it,
and they want me to develop it further.

286
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,680
- Uh, congratulations.
- Yep.

287
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,960
Sorry. Sorry. The apartheid project.
Is that the proposal <i>I</i> wrote?

288
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,760
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

289
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,320
They... They want me to direct it.

290
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,760
But I just think we make a good team.

291
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,440
Sartre and De Beauvoir.

292
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,560
Plath and Hughes.
You know, Beckett and Barbara Bray.

293
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,200
- Who's Bray?
- Beckett's girlfriend.

294
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,600
- I've never heard of her.
- She was a minor figure.

295
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,720
In her lifetime.

296
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,960
Come on, Emma.

297
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,160
Don't go home.

298
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,600
Let's do this. Let's make theater.

299
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,360
Let's change the world.

300
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,480
This is me.

301
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,080
- Looks nice.
- Mm.

302
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,880
You know your father
and I first stayed here in 1958?

303
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,600
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

304
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,920
Long time ago now.

305
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,760
- Are you all right, Mom?
- Hmm?

306
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:10,280
I don't know. You seem a bit...
preoccupied with something.

307
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,400
I...

308
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,560
I did want to talk to you
about something else,

309
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,560
but I'm a bit drunk now, I think.

310
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,520
Take me for lunch tomorrow.
We can talk about it properly. Hmm?

311
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,160
Just you and me.
Somewhere expensive. My treat.

312
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,200
I <i>am</i> proud of you.

313
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,200
Thanks.

314
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,120
Good night, darling.

315
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,640
- Good night.
- Night.

316
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,840
Wait, you seem... you seem a bit...

317
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,240
Is it... Is it you and Dad?
Are you getting a divorce?

318
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,960
God, no. Never!

319
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
Who could resist such a man?

320
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,800
Hello, darling.

321
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,120
Mwah.

322
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,360
- Hi, Dad.
