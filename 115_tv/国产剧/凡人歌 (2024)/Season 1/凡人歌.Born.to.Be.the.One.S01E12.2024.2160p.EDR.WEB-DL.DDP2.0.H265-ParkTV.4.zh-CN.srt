1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,880
<i>The 13:25 train
to Paris Gare du Nord</i>

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,880
<i>is about to depart from platform three.</i>

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,320
I don't understand.
I thought it was going through.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,840
What's left to discuss?

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,080
The food mixer?
Why does she want the food mixer?

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,840
The barbecue?

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,480
Uh, I don't have a garden.

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,560
As she knows, I don't have a garden.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
<i>Merci.</i>

10
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,880
- Hi.
- Hi.

11
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,000
- You look different.
- Do I?

12
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,560
If this was a fancy dress party,

13
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,920
you'd have come
as sophisticated Parisienne.

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,560
Right.
And what have you come as, then?

15
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,560
Ugh, I've come as fucked-up,
suicidal divorcé.

16
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,080
Well, at least you're not bitter.

17
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,640
- Shall I just get back on the train?
- Nah, not yet. Come on.

18
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,480
How far away is your flat?

19
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,800
Uh, oh, I thought we'd, uh, go
for a walk first. See some sights.

20
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,920
Oh.

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Okay.

22
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,280
Is that all right?

23
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,040
Of course. Yeah.

24
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,960
- You didn't have to meet me.
- Of course I did. Tourist.

25
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,160
Paris suits you.

26
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,680
Yeah, I love it here.

27
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,760
I can see that. You've changed.

28
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,760
In two months?

29
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,360
You look beautiful.

30
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,280
- So when were you last in Paris?
- Hmm. About three years ago.

31
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,080
My wife and I came for a mini-break.
Stayed at the Georges V.

32
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,360
So that was a waste of fucking money.

33
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,120
Do me a favor. If I mention it again,
could you just push me in the canal?

34
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,960
I don't... I don't mind.

35
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,680
But it's not why I came.

36
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,720
Okay.

37
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,520
I mean, we should talk about it.

38
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,640
What happened.

39
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,360
Yeah, we can.

40
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,480
Just later.

41
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,960
Here?

42
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,400
Shall we get some wine?

43
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,680
Not for me, thanks. Sort of off it.

44
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,920
Oh, really? How long?

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,120
A month or so.

46
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,840
I mean, it's not AA or anything.

47
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,280
Just, you know, trying to avoid it.

48
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,640
Nothing good ever came of it, so...

49
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,240
Okay. Uh, just coffee, then.

50
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,560
Just coffee.

51
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,120
- Ooh, uh...
- Dex, listen, I have something I...

52
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,440
- Please, can you sign this for me?
- No. Don't be ridiculous.

53
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,720
You've got to. Something...
Something personal with today's date.

54
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,160
Just in case you get really famous
and I need the cash.

55
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,560
Have you even read it?

56
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,240
Uh, I started to.
I just didn't get past page four.

57
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,080
Emma, I thought it was wonderful.

58
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,840
It's just a silly kids' book.

59
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,800
"The most exciting new voice
since Sue Townsend."

60
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,240
- Said the publisher's 12-year-old niece.
- Said <i>The Sunday Times.</i>

61
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,240
I read it in one go,
and this is coming from someone

62
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,440
who's been reading <i>Howards' Way</i>
for the past 15 years.

63
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,560
You mean <i>Howards End.
Howards' Way</i> is something different.

64
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,640
Whatever.

65
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,720
I loved it.

66
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,840
Okay.

67
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,160
Don't read it now. Read it later.

68
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,440
So tell me. How are things?

69
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,120
Divorce goes through in September.

70
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,880
Just a month before our anniversary.

71
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,600
Almost two whole years of wedded bliss.

72
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,440
Have you spoken much?

73
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,880
Not if I can help it.

74
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,520
We've stopped screaming abuse
and throwing things.

75
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,720
Now it's just, "Yes," "No,"

76
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,000
"Hello," "Goodbye."

77
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,000
More or less
what we said when we were married.

78
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,520
Did you hear
that they've moved in with Callum?

79
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,000
Yeah, I know. Tilly told me.

80
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,640
Yeah, some ridiculous mansion
in Clerkenwell,

81
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,040
which is where we used to go
for dinner parties. Yeah, so...

82
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,280
...that's pleasant.

83
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,280
Do you speak to Callum much, or...

84
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,880
God, no.

85
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,400
He's tried.

86
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,160
Yeah, he leaves me messages.
All gruff and cheery.

87
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,400
Like, "All right, mate.
Let's, you know, get some beers."

88
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,800
"Give me a call.
We'll talk things through."

89
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,400
Wanker.

90
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,320
Maybe I should go.
He still owes me three weeks' wages.

91
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,520
And how's Jazz?

92
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,160
- Sorry. We don't have to talk about this.
- No, it's fine.

93
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,160
Um, I've got her once a fortnight.

94
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,440
One lousy overnight stay.

95
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,560
Could you ask for more time?

96
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,760
I could, but...

97
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:03,400
Even now you can see the fear
in her eyes when her mom drives off.

98
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,000
"No. Don't leave me here
with this weird, sad freak."

99
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,800
And then I...
I buy her all these presents, Em.

100
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,840
It's pathetic. It's pathetic.

101
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,240
I... You know.

102
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,080
There's a pile of them
every time she arrives.

103
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,680
It's like Christmas morning every time.

104
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,240
Because if we're not
opening presents, then...

105
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,720
I don't... I don't know
what to do with her.

106
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,280
If we're not opening presents,
then she just...

107
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,040
She just starts crying...

108
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,800
...and asking for Mommy.

109
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,840
By which she means
Mommy and that bastard Callum.

110
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,680
And I don't even know what to buy her.

111
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,680
Because every time I see her,
she's different.

112
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,040
It's, uh, you know, you turn your back for

113
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,600
a week, ten days, and...

114
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,960
uh... everything's changed.

115
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,920
And she started walking.

116
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,240
For Chrissake, she started walking,
and I missed it.

117
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,960
How? How can I miss that? I mean, isn't...

118
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,160
Isn't that my job?
Fuck, I'm sorry. Bollocks.

119
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,960
Sorry.

120
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,080
Not the plan. Not the plan.

121
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,800
Stop saying sorry, Dex.

122
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,480
You don't need a plan.

123
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,120
Right? It's only me.

My place
is about half an hour from here.

130
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,560
Don't be imagining huge windows,
parquet floors, or anything.

131
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,080
It's just... It's just two rooms
over a courtyard.

132
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,480
Garret.

133
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,600
Yes, exactly. A garret.

134
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,760
A writer's garret.

135
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,920
"My gap year," says Emma, aged 33.

136
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,280
Living the dream.

137
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,040
Well, officially, I'm working. Book two.

138
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,960
Nisha Halliday goes on a school trip
to Paris and falls for this French boy,

139
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,080
Luc Grenoble.

140
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,000
- Luc Grenoble.
- Mm.

141
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,680
So here I am.

142
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,440
Doing the research.

143
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,840
Where have you gone?

144
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,880
Ah. Dunno, Em.

145
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
It's like

146
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,200
when I was younger,
everything seemed possible, and

147
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,520
now it's like nothing does.

148
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,400
You've just lost your confidence.
That's all.

149
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,320
All right, you've had a shitty,
shitty time.

150
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,520
But at some point, you are gonna think
of this as a new start.

151
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,600
What's going on with work?

152
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,440
- Not much.
- Okay. There's lots of things you can do.

153
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,440
Like what?

154
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,560
I dunno. Media.

155
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,240
You could try for presenting jobs again.

156
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,800
- Oof.
- What about photography? Or food?

157
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,160
- You could do something with food.
- I don't have the experience.

158
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,960
I'm not really qualified for anything.

159
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,720
- You've got a degree.
- A low 2:2 in Anthropology.

160
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,160
Hey. People will always
need anthropologists.

161
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,760
So, that's your pep talk?

162
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,760
That was it. How was it?

163
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,800
I still wanna jump in the canal.

164
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,040
Come on. Let's go.

165
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,400
It's just here.

166
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,720
Here we go. <i>Chez moi.</i>

167
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,920
Ah.

168
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,640
Oh, wow. Is that...

169
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,040
Book two? Yeah, but don't read it.
It's a work in progress.

170
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,600
- Oh, sorry. Sorry.
- No.

171
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,000
Dex, Dex, Dex, Dex, Dex.

172
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,240
Sorry. Sorry about that.
I'm just a bit, um, self-conscious.

173
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,760
The thing is, Dex, I've met someone.

174
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,120
Uh, you... you... you met someone?

175
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,880
Yeah.

176
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,840
Uh...

177
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,720
Okay. Who?

178
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,800
His name's Jean-Pierre.
Jean-Pierre Dusollier.

179
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,840
He's French?

180
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,200
No, Dex. He is Welsh.

181
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,600
Well, um...

182
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,560
Yeah, that's... that...
Uh, good for you, Em.

183
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,000
That's really great.

184
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,040
- I just wish you'd told me.
- You just got here.

185
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,680
Yeah. No, I mean before. Before I came.

186
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,720
Well, we haven't spoken much, have we?

187
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,000
Apart from the odd email,
and now here you are.

188
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,480
- Yeah. I came to talk about what happened.
- What's to say? We slept together once.

189
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,560
Three times.

190
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,680
I don't mean
how many acts of intercourse, Dex.

191
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,720
I mean the occasion.

192
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,840
Okay. The night.
One night together. A single night.

193
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,800
Yeah. Next thing I know,
you've run off to Paris

194
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,840
and thrown yourself
under the nearest Frenchman.

195
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,680
Thrown myself? Oh, fuck off, Dexter.

196
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,360
I don't mean that, obviously.

197
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,480
And I didn't run off.
The ticket was already booked.

198
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,800
Why do you think
that everything happens 'cause of you?

199
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,320
Could you not have phoned me, maybe?

200
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,200
- What? To ask your permission?
- No, to see how I felt about it.

201
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,840
To talk about that night.

202
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,680
- Maybe what it meant. I don't know.
- This is amazing.

203
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,760
You're annoyed
because we haven't examined our feelings.

204
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,880
Because you think
I should've waited for you.

205
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,120
No, not waited.

206
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,960
What?

207
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,080
You do realize
there's a certain amount of irony in this?

208
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,480
How?

209
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,200
Look. If you wanna talk
about that night, let's talk about it.

210
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,400
- We were both quite drunk.
- I wasn't.

211
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,120
Dex, you tried to take your pants off
with your trousers still on.

212
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,120
It wasn't that bad. Was it?

213
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,920
Don't fish. Come and sit down.

214
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:47,280
I think... you were very upset
and quite pissed that day, and

215
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,320
you came over, and it just happened.

216
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,920
With everything going on with Sylvie,
and not seeing Jasmine as much,

217
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,600
I think you were lonely,
and I was a shoulder to cry on.

218
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,480
Or to sleep with.

219
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,320
That's what I was.
I was a shoulder to sleep with.

220
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,120
- So that's what you think?
- That is what I think.

221
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,440
So you only slept with me
to make me feel better?

222
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,840
Did you feel better?

223
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,680
Yes, much better.

224
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,640
Okay, well, so did I. There you go.

225
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,400
It was pity sex.
It was... It was pity sex.

226
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,560
It wasn't pity, and you know it.

227
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,280
Well, I've been thinking about it.

228
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,880
A lot.

229
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,480
I haven't stopped thinking about it.

230
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,080
Ever since it happened.

231
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,240
You and me.

232
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,840
Yeah, I've thought about it too.

233
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,160
In the late '80s,
it was all I thought about.

234
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,840
- And now?
- Now?

235
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,080
Our time's passed.

236
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,320
How can you know that
unless we give it a try?

237
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,320
Because I know, Dexter.
Because I've met someone else.

238
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,160
And I'm not something you can resort to
when every option has been exhausted.

239
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,280
That's not what's going on.

240
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,000
It was just sex, Dexter.

241
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,720
With respect, Em, that's bollocks.

242
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,120
With respect, Dex, you can't rock up here
when you're on your uppers and think,

243
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,520
"Good old Emma.
Can always fall back on her."

244
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,080
- I am not the consolation prize, okay?
- I do not think that.

245
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,280
It's the opposite. It... It... It's...

246
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,800
Who's that?

247
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,880
It's Jean-Pierre.

248
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,400
Fuck.

249
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,400
Let's be nice?
I thought we could eat.

250
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,560
Good idea.

251
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,200
- Hey.
- Hi.

252
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Um, Dexter, Jean-Pierre.
Jean-Pierre, Dexter.

253
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,720
- Nice to meet you, man.
- Hi.

254
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,840
Um, I have heard so much about you.

255
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,520
Oh.

256
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,280
Famous Dexter.

257
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,080
- Oh.
- Yes.

258
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,480
Yes.

259
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,200
Yeah. So tell me everything about Emma.

260
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,960
Everything?

261
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,760
Where to begin?

262
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,280
Uh, no. You... you first.
How did you two meet?

263
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,200
Uh, in the bistro.

264
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,680
Yes, she... she was reading,

265
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,240
and usually people
who read in public places,

266
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,960
most often they're just
pretending to read, right?

267
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,800
But she was totally focused, and, uh...

268
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,640
I was intrigued.

269
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,800
So I asked her about the book,
which was <i>L'Étranger</i> by Camus.

270
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,240
I haven't read it.

271
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,080
It's okay. Anyway, uh, she was reading it
in the original French

272
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,280
and talked a lot about Camus.

273
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,120
That's how I discovered
that she's a... a real nerd.

274
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,960
A pretentious nerd.

275
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,200
Yes. Yes.

276
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,560
Exactly. But, uh,
you already know that, right?

277
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,120
Yeah.

278
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,280
Yeah, I do.

279
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,360
Right. So we've booked a table for seven.

280
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,880
- L'Éguille.
- Cool.

281
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,560
I'm sorry it's early,
but I couldn't get a later one.

282
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,880
Oh no, it's fine.

283
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,160
Shall we go?

284
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,640
Yeah, no. Actually, I'm sorry.
I think I've, uh...

285
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,320
I think I've picked something up
on... on the train.

286
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,560
I... My neck feels swollen.

287
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,320
Swollen glands or something. Um...

288
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,040
I think I'm gonna get, uh, an early night.

289
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,960
Oh. Okay, are you sure?

290
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,960
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, go.

291
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,000
Or I can stay.

292
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,840
No, definitely not. Just go. Go.

293
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,320
Sorry to be boring.

294
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,360
I'll be fine tomorrow.

295
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,640
Bye.

296
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:10,120
I'm gonna stay at Jean-Pierre's tonight,
so you can have the bed.

297
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,000
I'll be back in the morning.

298
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,320
Feel better.

299
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,040
What is it? What's wrong?

300
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,120
What?

301
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,080
It's French for "tonsillitis."

302
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,040
Your pretend tonsillitis.

303
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,400
I told Jean-Pierre
I was coming down with it too.

304
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,960
<i>♪ Oh, my light trips ♪</i>

305
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,440

306
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,040

307
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,800

<i>♪ Earthing ♪</i>

310
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,400
If you muck me about, Dexter.

311
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,760
- I won't.
- No, I mean it.

312
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,080
If you lead me on,
or let me down, or go behind my back...

313
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,520
...I will murder you.

314
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,840
I swear to God, I will eat your heart.

315
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,800
I won't do that, Em.

316
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,600
You won't?

317
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,880
I swear.

318
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,200
What?
